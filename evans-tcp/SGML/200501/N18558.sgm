<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a new publication appears, some prefatory account of the reasons which lead to it, and the manner in which it has been conducted, is generally expected.</P>
<P>The compiler of this history was early impel|led by his natural curiosity to inquire into the original settlement, progress, and improvement of the country which gave him birth. When he took up his residence in New-Hampshire his in|quiries were more particularly directed to that part of it. Having met with some valuable man|uscripts which were but little known, he began to extract and methodize the principal things in them; and this employment was (to speak in the style of a celebrated modern author) his "hobby "horse."</P>
<P>The work, crude as it was, being communicated to some gentlemen, to whose judgment he paid much deference, he was persuaded and encouraged to go on with his collection, until the thing be|came generally known, and a publication could not decently be refused.</P>
<P>He owns himself particularly obliged to the public officers both in this and the neighbouring state of Massachusetts, under the former as well as the present constitutions, for their obliging at|tention in favouring him with the use of the pub|lic records or extracts from them. He is under
<PB REF="024087_0004_0FC308D9F6FDC240">
equal obligation to a number of private gentlemen, who have either admitted him to their own col|lections of original papers or procured such for him. In the course of his inquiry he has fre|quently had reason to lament the loss of many valuable materials by fire and other accidents: But what has pained him more severely is the in|attention of some persons in whose hands original papers have been deposited, and who have suffer|ed them to be wasted and destroyed as things of no value. The very great utility of a public re|pository for such papers under proper regulations, has appeared to him in the strongest light, and he is persuaded that it is an object worthy the atten|tion of an enlightened legislature.</P>
<P>The late accurate and indefatigable Mr. PRINCE of Boston, (under whose ministry the author was educated and whose memory he shall always re|vere) began such a collection in his youth and continued it for above fifty years. By his will he left it to the care of the Old South Church, of which he was pastor, and it was deposited with a library of ancient books in an apartment of their meeting-house. To this collection the public are obliged for some material hints in the pre|sent work, the author having had frequent access to that library before the commencement of the late war. But the use which the British troops in 1775 made of that elegant building having proved fatal to this noble collection of manuscripts; the friends of science and of America must de|plore the irretrievable loss. Had we suffered it by the hands of SARACENS, the grief had been less poignant!</P>
<P>Historians have mentioned the affairs of New-Hampshire only in a loose and general manner.
<PB REF="024087_0005_0FC308E0ACFB4628">
Neale and Douglas, though frequently erroneous, have given some hints, which by the help of orig|inal records and other manuscripts, have in this work been carefully and largely pursued. Hutch|inson has said many things which the others have omitted; his knowledge of the antiquities of the country was extensive and accurate, and the pub|lic are much obliged by the publication of his history; but he knew more than he thought prop|er to relate. The few publications concerning New-Hampshire are fugiitve pieces dictated by party or interest. No regular historical deduc|tion has ever appeared. The late Mr. FITCH of Portsmouth made a beginning of this sort about the year 1728. From his papers some things have been collected which have not been met with else|where. The authorities from which information is derived are carefully noted in the margin. Where no written testimonies could be obtained, recourse has been had to the most authentic tra|dition, selected and compared with a scrupulous attention, and with proper allowance for the im|perfection of human memory. After all, the critical reader will doubtless find some chasms which in such a work it would be improper to fill by the help of imagination and conjecture.</P>
<P>The author makes no merit of his regard to truth. To have disguised or misrepresented facts would have been abusing the reader. No person can take more pleasure in detecting mistakes than the author in correcting them if he should have opportunity. In tracing the progress of contro|versy it is impossible not to take a side, though we are ever so remote from any personal interest in it: Censure or applause will naturally follow the opinion we adopt. If the reader should hap|pen
<PB REF="024087_0006_0FC308E22783CC88">
to entertain different feelings from the writer, he has an equal right to indulge them; but not at the expence of candor.</P>
<P>The Masonian controversy lay so directly in the way that it could not be avoided. The rancour shown on both sides in the early stages of it has now subsided. The present settlement is so ma|terially connected with the general peace and wel|fare of the people, that no wise man or friend to the country can at this day wish to overthrow it.</P>
<P>Mr. HUBBARD, Dr. MATHER and Mr. PEN|HALLOW have published narratives of the several Indian wars: These have been compared with the public records, with ancient manuscripts, with CHARLEVOIX'S history of New-France, and with the verbal traditions of the immediate suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rs or their descendants. The particular incidents of these wars may be tedious to strangers, but will be read with avidity by the posterity of those whose misfortunes and bravery were so conspicu|ous. As the character of a people must be col|lected from such a minute series, it would have been improper to have been less particular.</P>
<P>The writer has had it in view not barely to re|late facts, but to delineate the characters, the pas|sions, the interests and tempers of the persons who are the subjects of his narration, and to describe the most striking features of the times in which they lived. How far he has succeeded, or where|in he is defective, must be left to the judgment of <HI>every candid reader,</HI> to which this work is most respectfully submitted.</P>

<P>IT is happy for America that its discov|ery and settlement by the Europeans happened at a time, when they were emerging from a long period of ignorance and darkness. The discovery of the mag|netic needle, the invention of printing, the revival of literature and the reforma|tion of religion, had caused a vast altera|tion in their views, and taught them the true use of their rational and active pow|ers. To this concurrence of favourable causes we are indebted for the precision with which we are able to fix the begin|ning of this great American empire: An advantage of which the historians of other countries almost universally are destitu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e; their first aeras being either disguised by
<PB N="2" REF="024087_0010_0FC308F2A1116C70">
fiction and romance, or involved in im|penetrable obscurity.</P>
<P>Mankind do not easily relinquish an|cient and established prejudices, or adopt new systems of conduct, without some powerful attractive. The prospect of im|mense wealth, from the mines of Mexico and Peru, fired the Spaniards to a rapid conquest of those regions and the destruc|tion of their numerous inhabitants; but the northern continent, presenting no such glittering charms, was neglected by the European princes for more than a century after its discovery.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1496.</NOTE> No effectual care was taken to secure to themselves the posses|sion of so extensive a territory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince's Annals.</NOTE> or the ad|vantage of a friendly traffic with its na|tives, or of the fishery on its coasts; till private adventurers at a vast expence, with infinite hazard and persevering zeal, estab|lished settlements for themselves, and thereby enlarged the dominions of their sovereigns.</P>
<P>Of the voyagers who visited the north|ern coast of America, for the sake of its furs and fish, one of the most remarkable was Captain John Smith; who ranged the shore from Penobscot to Cape Cod,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1614.</NOTE> and in this route discovered the river Pascataqua; which he found to be a safe harbour with
<PB N="3" REF="024087_0011_0FC308FBAC90D810">
a rocky shore. He returned to England in one of his ships, and there published a description of the country, with a map of the sea-coast, which he presented to Prince Charles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smith's Voyage.</NOTE> who gave it the name of NEW-ENGLAND. The other ship he left be|hind under the care of Thomas Hunt, who decoyed about twenty of the natives on board, and sold them for slaves at Ma|laga. This perfidious action excited a vi|olent jealousy in the natives and bitter|ly enraged them against succeeding ad|venturers. Two of those savages having found their way back as far as Newfound|land, then under the government of Cap|tain John Mason, were restored to their native country by his friendly interposi|tion, and reported the strong disapproba|tion, which the English in general enter|tained of the mischievous plot by which they had been carried off. By this means, together with the prudent endeavours of Captain Thomas Dermer, and afterward of the Plymouth settlers, tranquillity was re-established between the Indians and the adventurers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's printed Narrative of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with the Indians&punc; p. 3.</NOTE> which was tolerably preserv|ed for many years. However fond we may have been of accusing the Indians of treachery and infidelity, it must be con|fessed that the example was first set them

by the Europeans. Had we always treat|ed them with that justice and humanity which our religion inculcates, and our true interest at all times required, we might have lived in as much harmony with them, as with any other people on the globe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1620.</NOTE>The importance of the country now began to appear greater than before, and some measures were taken to promote its settlement. A patent had been granted by King James in 1606, limiting the do|minion of Virginia, from the thirty-fourth, to the forty-fourth degree of northern la|titude; which extent of territory had been divided into two parts, called North and South Virginia. The latter was assigned to certain noblemen, knights, and gentle|men of London, the former to others in Bristol,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gorges's Narrative.</NOTE> Exeter and Plymouth. Those who were interested in the northern colony, finding that the patent did not secure them from the intrusions of others, petitioned for an enlargement and confirmation of their privileges.

<Q>The council established at Plymouth, in the county of Devon, for the planting, ruling and governing of New-England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Copy in Super. Court files.</NOTE> in America.</Q>
They were a corpora|tion with perpetual succession, by election of the majority; and their territories ex|tended from the fortieth to the forty-eighth degree of northern latitude. This patent, or charter, is the foundation of all the grants that were made of the country of New-England. But either from the jarring interests of the members, or their indistinct knowledge of the country, or their inattention to business, or some other cause which does not fully appear, their affairs were transacted in a confused man|ner from the begining; and the grants which they made wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> so inaccurately de|scribed, and interfer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d so much with each other, as to occasion difficulties and con|troversies,
<PB N="6" REF="024087_0014_0FC309002261F0E0">
some of which are not yet ended.</P>
<P>Two of the most active members of this council were Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Captain John Mason. Gorges had been an officer in the navy of Queen Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hume.</NOTE> intimately connected with Sir Walter Ra|leigh, of whose adventurous spirit he had a large share. After the peace which King James made in 1604, he was appointed governor of the fort and island of Ply|mouth in Devonshire. Whilst he resided there, Captain Weymouth, who had been employed by Lord Arundel in search of a nor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hwest passage, but had fallen short of his course and put in at Pemaquid, brought from thence into the harbour of Plymouth, five natives of America, three of whom were eagerly seized by Georges, and re|tained in his service for three years. Find|ing them of a tractable and communicative disposition, and having won their affec|tions by gentle treatment, he learned from them many particulars concerning their country, its rivers, harbours, islands, fish|eries and other productions; and the num|bers, force, disposition and government of the natives; and from this information he conceived sanguine hopes of indulging his genius, and making his fortune, by a tho|rough
<PB N="7" REF="024087_0015_0FC3090B2EDD7790">
discovery of the country. For this purpose he, in conjunction with others, ventured several ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gorges's Narrative.</NOTE> whereof some met with peculiar misfortunes; and others brought home accounts, which, though discouraging to some of his associates, made him determine upon farther attempts, wherein his resolution and perseverance were more conspicuous than any solid gain. These transactions were previous to the establishment of the council; in soliciting which, Gorges was so extremely active, that he was appointed their president, and had a principal share in all their transac|tions. Mason was a merchant of London, but became a sea-officer, and, after the peace, governor of Newfoundland, where he acquired a knowledge of America, which led him, on his return to England, into a close attachment to those who were en|gaged in its discovery; and upon some vacancy in the council, he was elected a member and became their secretary; be|ing also governor of Portsmouth in Hamp|shire.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1621. March 9.</NOTE> He procured a grant from the coun|cil, of all the land from the river Naum|keag [now Salem] round Cape Anne, to the river Merrimack; and up each of those rivers to the farthest head thereof; then to cross over from the head of the one
<PB N="8" REF="024087_0016_0FC3090FAFC7A8B0">
to the head of the other; with all the islands lying within three miles of the coast. This district was called MARIANA. The next year another grant was made, to Gorges and Mason jointly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1622. Aug. 10.</NOTE> of all the lands between the rivers Merrimack and Sagadehock, extending back to the great lakes and river of Canada, and this was called LACONIA.</P>
<P>Under the authority of this grant, Gorges and Mason, in conjunction with several merchants of London, Bristol, Exeter, Plymouth, Shrewsbury and Dor|chester, who styled themselves "The Company of Laconia," attempted the establishment of a colony and fishery at the river Pascataqua; and in the spring of the following year sent over David Thomp|son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1623.</NOTE> a Scotsman, Edward and William Hilton, fishmongers of London, with a number of other people, in two divisions, furnished with all necessaries to carry on their design. One of these companies landed on the southern shore of the river, at its mouth, and called the place Little-Harbour: Here they erected salt-works, and built an house which was afterward called Mason-H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll; but the Hiltons set up their stages eight miles further up the river toward the northwest, on a neck of
<PB N="9" REF="024087_0017_0FC30912E0A6B420">
land which the Indians called Winnicha|hanna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, but they named Northam, and afterward Dover. Thompson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's MS.</NOTE> not being pleased with his situation, removed the next spring to an island in the Bay of Massachusetts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1624.</NOTE> this the General Court afterward confirmed to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince's Annal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> and it still bears his name.</P>
<P>These settlements went on slowly for several years, but the natives being peace|able and several other small beginnings being made along the coast as far as Ply|mouth, a neighbourly intercourse was kept up among them, each following their respective employments of fishing, trading and planting, till the disorderly behaviour of one Morton, at Mount Wollaston in the Bay of Massachusetts, caused an alarm among the scattered set|tlements as far as Pascataqua.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1628.</NOTE> This man had, in defiance of the king's proclama|tion, made a practice of selling arms and ammunition to the Indians, whom he employed in hunting and fowling for him; so that the English, seeing the Indians armed in the woods, began <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be in terror. They also apprehended danger of another kind; for Morton's plantation was a re|ceptacle for discontented servants, whose desertion weakened the settlements, and

who, being there without law, were more formidable than the savages themselves. The principal persons of Pascataqua therefore readily united with their neigh|bours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince's Annals.</NOTE> in making application to the col|ony of Plymouth, which was of more force than all the rest, to put a stop to this growing mischief; which they hap|pily effected by seizing Morton and sending him prisoner to England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1629</NOTE>Some of the scattered planters in the Bay of Massachusetts, being desirous of making a settlement in the neighbour|hood of Pascataqua, and following the ex|ample of those at Plymouth, who had purchased their lands of the Indians, which they conscientiously thought neces|sary to give them a just title, procured a general meeting of Indians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 17.</NOTE> at Squamscot falls, where they obtained a deed from Passaconaway Sagamore of Penacook, Runnaawitt of Pantucket, Wahangnona|witt of Squamscot, and Rowls of New|ichwannock: Wherein they express their

This tract of land was called NEW-HAMP|SHIRE: It comprehended the whole of Whelewright's purchase; and unless Ma|son's intention was to frustrate his title, it is difficult to assign a reason for the pro|curement of this patent, as the same land, with much more, had been granted to Gorges and Mason jointly, seven years be|fore. If there was an agreement between them to divide the province of Laconia, and take out new patents from the coun|cil, in preference to the making a deed of partition; it is not easy to conceive why the western boundary should be contract|ed to sixty miles from the sea, when the lakes and river of Canada were supposed to be but ninety or an hundred miles from Pascataqua.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gorges's Hist of A|merica, p. 48.</NOTE> If this grant was intended as an equivalent for the patent of Mariana, which the council had the preceding year included in their deed to the Massachusetts company; it is impossible to account for the extension of New-Hampshire to the river Merrimack, when the grant of Mas|sachusetts reached to

<P>A great part of Captain Neal's errand was to penetrate the interior part of the province of Laconia, concerning which the adventurers had formed very sanguine expectations. It was described as con|taining divers lakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gorges's Hist. of A|merica, p. 47.</NOTE> and extending back to a great lake and river in the country of the Iroquois. This river was said to be fair and large, containing many fruitful

islands; the air pure and salubrious; the country pleasant, having some high hills; full of goodly forests, fair vallies and fer|tile plains; abounding in corn, vines, chesnuts, walnuts, and many other sorts of fruit; the rivers well stored with fish, and environed with goodly meadows full of timber-trees. In the great lake were said to be four islands, full of pleasant woods and meadows, having great store of stags, fallow-deer, elks, roe-bucks, beavers and other game, and these islands were supposed to be commodiously situat|ed for habitation and traffic, in the midst of a fine lake, abounding with the most delicate fish. No one who is acquainted with the interior part of the country in its wilderness state, can forbear smiling at this romantic description, penned in the true style of adventurers: yet such an im|pression had the charms of Laconia made on the minds of our first settlers, that Neal set out on foot, in company with Jocelyn and Darby Field,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1632.</NOTE> to discover these beautiful lakes, and settle a trade with the Indians by pinnaces, imagining the dis|tance to be short of an hundred miles. In the course of their travels, they visited the white mountains, which they describ|ed in the same romantic style, to be a

This summit was said to be far above the clouds, and from hence they beheld a vapor like a vast pillar, drawn up by the sun-beams, out of a great lake into the air, where it was form|ed into a cloud. The country beyond these mountains northward, was said to be "daunting terrible," full of rocky hills, as thick as mole-hills in a meadow, and clothed with infinite thick woods. They had great expectation of finding precious stones on these mountains; and something resembling chrystal being pick|ed up,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's MS Hist.</NOTE> was sufficient to give them the name of the CHRYSTAL-HILLS.

<P>This expedition, being ended, was suc|ceeded by one of another kind. The coast was alarmed by the report of a pirate, one Dixy Bull; who with fifteen others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">November.</NOTE> be|ing employed in the Indian trade at the eastward, had taken several boats and rifled the fort at Pemaquid. Neal, in conjunc|tion with the others, equipped four pin|naces and shallops, manned with forty men, being all the force that both plantations could spare, who, being joined by twenty more in a bark from Boston, proceeded to Pemaquid; but contrary winds and bad weather obliged them to return without meeting the pirates, who made their way farther to the eastward, and at length got to England; where Bull met with his de|serts.

Bread was either brought from England in meal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince's Annals. vol. 2. p. 30.70.</NOTE> or from Virginia in grain, and then sent to the wind-mill at Boston, there being none erected here. Very little improvement was made on the lands; the lakes were not explored; the vines were planted but came to nothing; no mines were found but those of iron, and these were not wrought; three or four houses only were built within the first se|ven years; the peltry trade with the In|dians was of some value, and the fishery served for the support of the inhabitants; but yielded no great profit to the adven|turers, who received but inadequate re|turns in lumber and furs. They saw their interest sinking apace, and grew dispirit|ed; and the major part of them either re|linquished the design, or sold their shares to Mason and Gorges, who were more san|guine than the rest, and became (either by purchase or tacit consent of the others) the principal, if not sole proprietors. These gentlemen renewed their exertions with greater vigour, sent over a fresh supply of servants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1634.</NOTE> and materials for carrying on the settlement, and appointed Francis Williams their governor.

<P>The charter by which the council of Plymouth was established,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1635.</NOTE> had been from the beginning disrelished by the Virginia company; who spared no pains to get it revoked. Their applications to the king proved fruitless; but when the parliament began to enquire into the grievances of the nation, this patent was complained of as a monopoly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gorges's Narrative, p. 22 &amp; 44.</NOTE> Sir Ferdinando Gorges, being summoned, appeared before them, and both in person and by his council de|fended it in a masterly manner, but in vain; for when the national grievances were presented to the throne, the patent of New-England was the first. The coun|cil also had got into disrepute with the high-church party, for having encouraged the settlement of the Plymouth and Massachu|setts colonists, who fled from their perse|cutions. These prejudices against them, operating as discouragements to their un|dertaking, induced the council to resign their charter to the king; having previ|ously taken care to secure some portion of the expiring interest to such of themselves as were disposed to accept it. The scheme
<PB N="25" REF="024087_0033_0FC3095A8CB4CEC0">
they had in view was to divide their ter|ritory into twelve provinces, under as ma|ny proprietary governors, subject to one general governor; and they went so far as to nominate Gorges, then threescore years of age, for the person, and build a ship of war, which was to bring him over and remain in the service of the country. But the ship fell and broke in the launch|ing;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's MS Hist.</NOTE> and their project not being suffici|ently attended to by those in power, they were obliged to be content with such grants as they could make, of those districts, in|to which they had divided the country. That which was now made to Mason comprehended both his former patents, extending from Naumkeag to Pascataqua, and sixty miles northwestward within the land, together with the south half of the Isles of Shoals, and ten thousand acres at Sagadahock; saving to those already set|tled within these limits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Files of the Sup.

Mason had his title confirmed by the king after the surrender of the charter is a point that has been questi|oned. I shall here collect what evidence I have met with on both sides.</P>
<P>In a pamphlet published in 1728, containing a detail of the grants and transactions of Capt. Mason, it is said
<Q>K. Charles I. by charter dated Aug. 19, 1635, gives, grants and confirms unto Capt. John Mason, then called treasurer and paymaster of his army, his heirs and assigns, all the aforesaid tract of land grant|ed to him by the council of Plymouth, by the name of the pro|vince of New-Hampshire; <HI>with power of government,</HI> and as am|ple jurisdiction and prerogatives as used by the bishop of Dur|ham; creating him and his aforesaids <HI>absolute lords and proprietors</HI> of the province of New-Hampshire, with power of conferring honours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doug. Summary, l. 418. Hist. Mass. l. 317.</NOTE></Q>
&amp;c. On this authority (I suppose) Douglas has as|serted the same thing. On which Hutchinson remarks
<Q>This is not probable. His heirs were certainly unacquainted with it, or they would have made mention of it before the king in coun|cil in 1691.</Q>
The report of the Lords Chief Justices in 1677, wherein the several grants are recited, makes no mention of this: But on the contrary it is said&punc;
<Q>As to Mr. Mason's <HI>right of govern|ment</HI> within the soil he claimed their lordships, and indeed his own council, agreed <HI>he had none&punc;</HI> the great council of Plymouth, under whom he claimed, having no power to transfer govern|ment to any.</Q>
The Lords of Trade in a report to the king in 1753, say,
<Q>It is alledged that this last grant to Mason was ratified and confirmed by the crown, by charter dated Aug. 19, 1635, with full power of civil jurisdiction and government, but <HI>no such charter as this appears upon record.</HI></Q></P>
<P>None of Mason's heirs ever attempted to assume government by virtue of such a charter, as the heirs of Gorges did in the province of Maine. Robert Mason was appointed councellor by mandamus&punc; and Samuel Allen, who purchased the title, was governor by com|mission from the crown.</P>
<P>There is an original letter in the Recorder's files, written by George Vaughan to Ambrose Gibbons, both factors for the compa|ny of Laconia, April 10, 1636, long before any controversy arose on this point, which may give more light to it than any thing that has yet been published. I shall give it a place in the Appendix.</P></NOTE>. In June following the
<PB N="26" REF="024087_0034_0FC3095BE07952F0">

<Q>To the corporation of Lynn Regis in Norfolk the place of his nativity, he gave two thousand acres of land in New-Hampshire, subject to the yearly rent of one penny per acre to his heirs, and two fifths of all mines royal; on condition that five families should within five years be settled there|upon. To his brother in law John Wal|laston, three thousand acres, subject to the yearly rent of one shilling. To his grandchild Anne Tufton, ten thousand acres at Sagadahock. To Robert Tufton, his grandson, he gave his manor of Mason-hall, on condition that he should take the sirname of Mason. He also gave to his brother Wallaston in trust, one thousand acres for the maintenance of
<Q>an honest, godly and religious preacher of God's word;</Q>
and one thousand more for the support of a grammar-school; each of these estates to be conveyed to feoffees in trust, and their successors, paying annually one penny per acre to his heirs. The
<PB N="28" REF="024087_0036_0FC30968AF354038">
residue of his estate in New-Hampshire he gave to his grandson John Tufton, he taking the sirname of Mason, and to his lawful issue; or in want thereof to Robert Tufton and his lawful issue; or in want thereof to Doctor Robert Mason, chancellor of the diocese of Winchester, and his lawful issue; or, in want of such issue, to his own other right heirs for|ever; provided that it should not go out of the name of Mason. The residuary legatee was required to pay five hundred pounds out of this estate to his sister Mary, and all the grandchildren were to relinquish their right to one thousand pounds due from this estate to their fa|ther Joseph Tufton.</Q>
The estate in America was valued in the inventory at ten thousand pounds sterling.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS in Sup. Court files.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Massachusetts planters viewed Ma|son as their enemy, because he with Gorges had privately encouraged some persons whom they had censured and sent home, to petition against them as disaffec|ted to the government; and had endea|voured to get their charter set aside, to make way for the scheme of a general governor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Hubbard relates the following anecdote, without men|tioning the name of the person.
<Q>One of the gentlemen who was known to be one of the greatest adversaries to the affairs of the Massachusetts, fell sick and died. In his sickness he sent for the minister, and bewailed his enmity against them: and promised if he recovered, he would be as good a friend to New-England, as he had been an enemy; but his fatal hour being come, his purposes of that nature were cut off. The passage aforegoing was certified by letters from lord Say and others to the governor of New-England about the year 1635</Q></P>
<P>Governor Winthrop has the following remark in his Journal.

not as freeholds, but by leases subject to quit-rents. To settle a colony of tenants in a climate so far northward, where the charges of subsistence and improvement were much greater than the value of the lands, after the improvements were made; especially in the neighbourhood of so res|pectable and growing a colony as that of Massachusetts, was indeed a chimerical project; and had not the wiser people among them sought an union with the Massachusetts, in all probability the set|tlements must have been deserted.</P>

<P>WHILE the lower plantation on the river Pascataqua lay under dis|couragement by the death of its principal patron, the upper settlement, though car|ried on with more success, had peculiar difficulties to struggle with. Two thirds of this patent belonged to some merchants of Bristol, the other third to some of Shrewsbury; and there was an agreement that the division should be made by indif|ferent men. Captain Wiggen who was sent over to superintend their affairs, af|ter about one year's residence in the coun|try made a voyage to England, to pro|cure more ample m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ans for carrying on the plantation. In the mean time those of Bristol had sold their interest to the lords Say and Broke, George Willys and William Whiting, who continued Wig|gen in the agency, and procured a consi|derable number of families in the West of England, some of whom were of good

to come over and increase the co|lony.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's MS Hist. Dover Re|cords.</NOTE> It appears from ancient records that Wiggen had a power of granting lands to the settlers; but, as trade was their principal object, they took up small lots, intending to build a compact town on Dover Neck, which lies between two branches of the river, and is a fine, dry, and healthy situation; so high as to com|mand all the neighbouring shores, and af|ford a very extensive and delightful pro|spect. On the most inviting part of this eminence they built a meeting-house, which was afterward surrounded with an en|trenchment and flankarts, the remains of which are still visible. Wiggen also brought over William Leverich, a worthy and able puritan minister; but his allowance from the adventurers proving too small for his support in a new country, where all the necessaries of life were scarce and dear, he was obliged to remove to the southward; and settled at Sandwich in the colony of Plymouth. This proved an unhappy event to the people, who, being left de|stitute of regular instruction, were exposed to the intrusions of artful impostors.</P>
<P>The first of these was one Burdet.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1634.</NOTE> He had been a minister at Yarmouth in Eng|land;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's MS Hist.</NOTE> but either really or pretendedly tak|ing

offence at the extravagancies of the bishops and spiritual courts, came over to New-England, and joined with the church in Salem, who employed him for a year or two as a preacher, being a good scho|lar and plausible in his behaviour. But, disgusted with the strictness of their dis|cipline,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1636.</NOTE> he removed to Dover; and con|tinued for some time in good esteem with the people as a preacher; until by artful insinuations he raised such a jealousy in their minds against Wiggen their gover|nor, that they deprived him of his office, and elected Burdet in his place.</P>
<P>During his residence here, he carried on a correspondence with Archbishop Laud to the disadvantage of the Massachusetts colony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1637.</NOTE> representing them as hypocritical and disaffected, and that under pretence of greater purity and discipline in matters of religion, they were aiming at indepen|dent sovereignty; it being accounted per|jury and treason by their general court, to speak of appeals to the king. The pre|late thanked him for his zeal in the king's service,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1638.</NOTE> and assured him that care should be taken to redress those disorders when leisure from their other concerns would permit. This letter of the arch|bishop was intercepted, and shewn to the governor of Massachusetts. Burdet's vil|lainy
<PB N="35" REF="024087_0043_0FC30981201AC7D0">
was considered as the more atrocious, because he had been admitted a freeman of their corporation, and had taken the oath of fidelity. A copy of his own letter was afterward found in his closet.</P>
<P>About this time, the Antinomian con|troversy at Boston having occasioned the banishment of the principal persons of that sect, several of them retired to this settle|ment, being without the jurisdiction of Massachusetts. When this was known, Governor Winthrop wrote to Wiggen, Burdet and others of this plantation,
<Q>that as there had hitherto been a good corre|spondence between them it would be much resented if they should receive the exiles; and intimating the intention of the general court to survey the utmost limits of their patent, and make use of them.</Q>
To this Burdet returned a scornful answer, refusing to give the go|vernor his title. The governor thought of citing him to court to answer for his contempt; but was dissuaded from it by Dudley, the deputy-governor, who judg|ed it imprudent to exasperate him, lest he should avenge himself by farther accusing them to their enemies in England. The governor contented himself with sending to Hilton an account of Burdet's behavi|our,
<PB N="36" REF="024087_0044_0FC30989EA581A68">
inclosing a copy of his letter, and cautioning the people not to put them|selves too far under his power. His true character did not long remain secret; for being detected in some lewd actions he made a precipitate removal to Agamenti|cus [now York] in the province of Maine, where he also assumed to rule, and conti|nued a course of injustice and adultery till the arrival of Thomas Gorges, their go|vernor, [in 1640] who laid a fine on him, and seized his cattle for the payment of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The records of the court mention him as

When he arrived, he found all in confusion; and falling in with the royal|ists was taken and imprisoned by the par|liamentary party, which is the last account we have of him.</P>
<P>One of the exiles on account of the An|tinomian controversy, was John Whele|wright, brother to the famous Anne Hutch|inson. He had been a preacher at Brain|tree, which was then part of Boston, and was a gentleman of learning, piety and zeal. Having engaged to make a settle|ment within ten years, on the lands he
<PB N="37" REF="024087_0045_0FC3098AE96FD578">
had purchased of the Indians at Squam|scot falls, he with a number of his adhe|rents began a plantation there, which ac|cording to the agreement made with Ma|son's agents they called Exeter.

Their rulers were Isaac Grosse, Nicholas Needham, and Thomas Wilson; each of whom continued in office the space of a year, having two assistants. The laws were made in a popular assembly and for|mally consented to by the rulers. Trea|son, and rebellion against the king, (who is styled "the Lord's anointed") or the country, were made capital crimes; and sedition was punishable by a fine of ten pounds, or otherwise, at the discretion of the court. This combination subsisted three years.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="024087_0046_0FC3098CA467D300">About the same time a plantation was formed at Winnicumet, which was called Hampton. The principal inducement to the making this settlement was the very extensive salt-marsh, which was extreme|ly valuable, as the uplands were not cul|tivated so as to produce a sufficiency of hay for the support of cattle. With a view to secure these meadows, the general court of Massachusetts had [in 1636] em|powered Mr. Dummer of Newbury, with John Spencer, to build an house there at the expence of the colony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Massa. Re|cords.</NOTE> which was to be refunded by those who should settle there. Accordingly an house was built, and commonly called the Bound-house; though it was intended as a mark of pos|session rather than of limits. The archi|tect was Nicholas Easton, who soon after removed to Rhode-Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Callender's Century Sermon, p. 93.</NOTE> and built the first English house in Newport.</P>

<P>The authority of Massachusetts having established this settlement, they, from the beginning, considered it as belonging to their colony. Though the agent of Ma|son's estate made some objection to their proceeding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Depo|sition in Sup. Court files.</NOTE> yet no legal method being taken to controvert this extension of their claim, the way was prepared for one still greater, which many circumstances con|curred to establish.</P>
<P>After the death of Captain Mason, his widow and executrix sent over Francis Norton as her "general attorney;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anne Ma|son's Let|ters, and</NOTE>" to whom she committed the whole management of the estate.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Depo|sitions in Sup. Court files.</NOTE> But the expence so far exceed|ed the income, and the servants grew so impatient for their arrears, that she was obliged to relinquish the care of the plan|tation, and tell the servants that they must shift for themselves. Upon which they shared the goods and cattle. Norton drove above an hundred oxen to Boston, and
<PB N="40" REF="024087_0048_0FC309A3579F0710">
there sold them for twenty-five pounds sterling per head, which it is said was the current price of the best cattle in New-England at that time. These were of a large breed, imported from Denmark, from whence Mason had also procured a number of men skilled in sawing planks and making potashes. Having shared the stock and other materials, some of the peo|ple quitted the plantation; others of them tarried, keeping possession of the buildings and improvements, which they claimed as their own; the houses at Newichwan|nock were burned; and thus Mason's estate was ruined. These events happened be|tween 1638 and 1644.</P>
<P>Among the Antinomians who were ba|nished from Boston,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's MS Histo|ry.</NOTE> and took refuge in these plantations, was Captain John Un|derhill, in whose story will appear some very strong characteristics of the spirit of these times. He had been a soldier in the Netherlands, and was brought over to New-England by Governor Winthrop, to train the people in military discipline. He served the country in the Pequod war, and was in such reputation in the town of Boston,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince's Annals, MS.</NOTE> that they had chosen him one of their deputies. Deeply tinctured with Antinomian principles, and possessed of
<PB N="41" REF="024087_0049_0FC309A76AE27C30">
an high degree of enthusiasm, he made a capital figure in the controversy; being one of the subscribers to a petition in which the court was censured, with an indecent severity, for their proceedings against Whelewright. For this offence he was disfranchised. He then made a voyage to England;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 15th, 1637.</NOTE> and upon his return petitioned the court for three hundred acres of land which had been promised him for his former services, intending to remove after Whele|wright. In his petition he acknowledged his offence in condemning the court, and declared
<Q>that the Lord had brought him to a sense of his sin in that respect, so that he had been in great trouble on ac|count thereof.</Q>
On this occasion the court thought proper to question him concerning an offensive expression, which he had uttered on board the ship in which he came from England,
<Q>that the go|vernment at Boston were as zealous as the scribes and Pharisees, and as Paul before his conversion.</Q>
He denied the charge, and it was proved to his face by a woman who was passenger with him, and whom he had endeavoured to seduce to his opinions. He was also questioned for what he had said to her concerning the manner of his receiv|ing
<PB N="42" REF="024087_0050_0FC309AB2E2FAB60">
assurance, which was,
<Q>that having long lain under a spirit of bondage, he could get no assurance; till at length as he was taking a pipe of tobacco, the spirit set home upon him an absolute promise of free grace, with such assurance and joy that he had never since doubt|ed of his good estate, neither should he, whatever sins he might fall into.</Q>
This he would neither own nor deny; but ob|jected to the sufficiency of a single testi|mony. The court committed him for abusing them with a pretended retraction, and the next day passed the sentence of banishment upon him. Being allowed the liberty of attending public worship, his enthusiastic zeal brake out in a speech in which he endeavoured to prove
<Q>that as the Lord was pleased to convert Saul while he was persecuting, so he might manifest himself to him while making a moderate use of the good creature to|bacco; professing withal that he knew not wherein he had deserved the cen|sure of the court.</Q>
The elders reprov|ed him for this inconsiderate speech; and Mr. Cotton told him,
<Q>that though God often laid a man under a spirit of bon|dage while walking in sin, as was the case with Paul, yet he never sent a spi|rit
<PB N="43" REF="024087_0051_0FC309B4DD2F63C8">
of comfort but in an ordinance, as he did to Paul by the ministry of Ana|nias; and therefore exhorted him to ex|amine carefully the revelation and joy to which he pretended.</Q>
The same week he was privately dealt with on sus|picion of adultery, which he disregarded; and therefore on the next sabbath was questioned for it before the church; but the evidence not being sufficient to con|vict him, the church could only admonish him.</P>
<P>These proceedings, civil and ecclesiasti|cal, being finished, he removed out of their jurisdiction; and after a while came to Dover, where he procured the place of governor in the room of Burdet. Gover|nor Winthrop hearing of this, wrote to Hilton and others of this plantation, in|forming them of his character. Under|hill intercepted the letter, and returned a bitter answer to Mr. Cotton; and wrote another letter full of reproaches against the governor to a gentleman of his family, while he addressed the governor himself in a fawning obsequious strain, begging an obliteration of former miscarriages, and a bearing with human infirmities. These letters were all sent back to Hilton; but too late to prevent his advancement.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="024087_0052_0FC309B5A2926B08"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1639.</NOTE>Being settled in his government, he pro|cured a church to be gathered at Dover who chose Hanserd Knollys for their mi|nister. He had come over from Eng|land the year before; but being an Ana|baptist of the Antinomian cast, was not well received in Massachusetts, and came here while Burdet was in office, who for|bad his preaching; but Underhill, agree|ing better with him, prevailed to have him chosen their minister. To ingratiate him|self with his new patron, Knollys wrote in his favour to the church in Boston; styling him
<Q>The right worshipful their honoured governor.</Q>
Notwithstanding which they cited him again to appear be|fore them; the court granting him safe conduct. At the same time complaint was made to the chief inhabitants on the river, of the breach of friendship in ad|vancing Underhill after his rejection; and a copy of Knollys's letter was returned, wherein he had written that
<Q>Underhill was an instrument of God for their ruin,</Q>
and it was enquired whether that letter was written by the desire or consent of the people. The principal per|sons of Portsmouth and Dover disclaimed his miscarriages, and expressed their rea|diness to call him to account when a pro|per
<PB N="45" REF="024087_0053_0FC309B728618A28">
information should be presented; but begged that no force might be sent against him. By his instigation Knollys had al|so written to his friends in England, a ca|lumnious letter against the Massachusetts planters, representing them as more arbi|trary than the high-commission court, and that there was no real religion in the coun|try. A copy of this letter being sent from England to Governor Winthrop, Knollys was so ashamed at the discovery, that ob|taining a licence, he went to Boston; and at the public lecture before the governor, magistrates, ministers and the congregation, made confession of his fault, and wrote a retraction to his friends in England, which he left with the governor to be sent to them.</P>
<P>Underhill was so affected with his friend's humiliation, and the disaffection of the peo|ple of Piscataqua to him, that he resolved to retrieve his character in the same way. Having obtained safe conduct, he went to Boston, and in the same public manner ac|knowledged his adultery, his disrespect to the government and the justice of their proceedings against him: But his confes|sion was mixed with so many excuses and extenuations that it gave no satisfaction; and the evidence of his scandalous deport|ment
<PB N="46" REF="024087_0054_0FC309C4C4D9DDF8">
being now undeniable, the church passed the sentence of excommunication, to which he seemed to submit, and appear|ed much dejected while he remained there.</P>
<P>Upon his return, to please some disaf|fected persons at the mouth of the river, he sent thirteen armed men to Exeter to rescue out of the officer's hand one Fish, who had been taken into custody for speaking against the king. The people of Dover forbad his coming into their court till they had considered his crimes and he promised to resign his place if they should disapprove his conduct; but hear|ing that they were determined to remove him, he rushed into court in a passion, took his seat, ordered one of the magi|strates to prison for saying that he would not sit with an adulterer, and refused to receive his dismission, when they voted it. But they proceeded to chuse another go|vernor, Roberts, and sent back the prison|er to Exeter.</P>
<P>A new scene of difficulty now arose. Thomas Larkham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1640.</NOTE> a native of Lyme in Dorsetshire and formerly a minister at Northam near Barnstable, who had come over to New-England, and not favour|ing the doctrine, nor willing to submit to the discipline of the churches in Massa|chusetts,
<PB N="47" REF="024087_0055_0FC309C6FA1F8058">
came to Dover; and being a preach|er of good talents, eclipsed Knollys, and rais|ed a party who determined to remove him. He therefore gave way to the popular pre|judice, and suffered Larkham to take his place; who soon discovered his licentious principles by receiving into the church persons of immoral characters, and assum|ing, like Burdet, the civil as well as ec|clesiastical authority. The better sort of the people were displeased and restored Knollys to his office who excommunicated Larkham. This bred a riot in which Lark|ham laid hands on Knollys, taking away his hat on pretence that he had not paid for it; but he was civil enough afterward to return it. Some of the magistrates joined with Larkham, and forming a court, summoned Underhill, who was of Knollys's party to appear before them, and answer to a new crime which they had to alledge against him. Underhill collected his adherents; Knollys was armed with a pistol, and another had a bible mounted on an halbert for an en|sign. In this ridiculous parade they marched against Larkham and his party, who prudently declined a combat, and sent down the river to Williams the go|vernor, at Portsmouth, for assistance.
<PB N="48" REF="024087_0056_0FC309C86335A048">
He came up in a boat with an armed party, beset Knollys's house where Under|hill was, guarded it night and day till a court was summoned, and then, Williams sitting as judge, Underhill and his company were found guilty of a riot, and after be|ing fined, were banished the plantation. The new crime which Larkham's party alledged against Underhill was that he had been secretly endeavouring to per|suade the inhabitants to offer themselves to the government of Massachusetts, whose favor he was desirous to purchase, by these means, as he knew that their view was to extend their jurisdiction as far as they imagined their limits reached, when|ever they should find a favourable oppor|tunity. The same policy led him with his party to send a petition to Boston, praying for the interposition of the govern|ment in their case: In consequence of which the governor and assistants com|missioned Simon Bradstreet, Esq. with the famous Hugh Peters, then minister of Salem, and Timothy Dalton of Hampton, to enquire into the matter, and effect a reconciliation, or certify the state of things to them. These gentlemen travelled on foot to Dover, and finding both sides in fault, brought the matter to this issue,
<PB N="49" REF="024087_0057_0FC309D0BB17E630">
that the one party revoked the excom|munication, and the other the fines and banishment.</P>
<P>In the heat of these disputes, a discovery was made of Knollys's failure in point of chastity. He acknowledged his crime before the church; but they dismissed him and he returned to England, where he suffered by the severity of the long parliament in 1644;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neal's Hist. Puritans, 4to vol. II. p. 113.</NOTE> and being forbidden to preach in the churches, opened a separate meet|ing in Great St. Helen's, from which he was soon dislodged, and his followers dis|persed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neal's Hist.

<Q>a good man in a good old age.</Q>
(September 19, 1691, Aet. 93.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mather's Magnal. lib. 3. p. 7.</NOTE>)</P>
<P>Underhill having finished his career in these parts obtained leave to return to Boston, and finding honesty to be the best policy, did in a large assembly, at the public lecture, and during the sitting of the court, make a full confession of his adultery and hypocrisy, his pride and contempt of authority, justifying the church and court in all that they had done against him, de|claring that his pretended assurance had failed him, and that the terror of his mind had at some times been so great, that he had
<PB N="50" REF="024087_0058_0FC309D54AB99B00">
drawn his sword to put an end to his life. The church being now satisfied, restored him to their communion. The court, af|ter waiting six months for evidence of his good behaviour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince's Annals.</NOTE> took off his sentence of banishment, and released him from the punishment of his adultery: The law which made it capital having been enact|ed after the crime was committed, could not touch his life. Some offers being made him by the Dutch at Hudson's riv|er,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's MS Hist.</NOTE> whose language was familiar to him, the church of Boston hired a vessel to trans|port him and his family thither, furnish|ing them with all necessaries for the voy|age. The Dutch governor gave him the command of a company of an hundred and twenty men, and he was very service|able in the wars which that colony had with the Indians, having, it is said, killed one hundred and fifty on Long-Island, and three hundred on the Main. He con|tinued in their service till his death.</P>
<P>We find in this relation a striking in|stance of that species of false religion, which, having its seat in the imagination, instead of making the heart better and re|forming the life, inflames the passions, stupifies reason, and produces the wildest effects in the behaviour. The excesses of
<PB N="51" REF="024087_0059_0FC309D6A5DD2550">
enthusiasm have often been observed to lead to sensual gratifications; the same na|tural fervour being sufficient to produce both. It cannot be strange that they who decry morality, should indulge such gross and scandalous enormities as are sufficient to invalidate all those evidences of their religious character on which they lay so much stress. But it is not so surprising that men should be thus misled, as that such frantic zealots should ever be reduced to an acknowledgment of their offences; which in this instance may be ascribed to the strict discipline then practised in the churches of New-England.</P>
<P>The people of Dover and Portsmouth during all this time had no power of govern|ment delegated from the crown; but find|ing the necessity of some more determinate form than they had yet enjoyed, combined themselves each into a body politic after the example of their neighbours at Ex|eter. The inhabitants of Dover, by a written instrument,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Octo. 22.</NOTE> signed by forty one persons, agreed to submit to the laws of England, and such others as should be enacted by a majority of their number,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's MS Hist.</NOTE> until the royal pleasure should be known.

<P>Four distinct governments (including one at Kittery on the north side of the river) were now formed on the several branches of Pascataqua. These combi|nations being only voluntary agree|ments, liable to be broken or subdivided on the first popular discontent, there could be no safety in the continuance of them. The distractions in England at this time had cut off all hope of the royal attention, and the people of the several settlements were too much divided in their opinions to form any general plan of government which could afford a prospect of perma|nent utility. The more considerate persons among them, therefore thought it best to treat with Massachusetts about taking them under their protection. That government was glad of an opportunity to realize the construction which they had put upon the clause of their charter wherein their nor|thern limits are defined.

The affair was more than a year in agitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1641. April 14.</NOTE> and was at length concluded by an instrument subscribed in the presence of the general court by George Willys, Robert Salton|stall, William Whiting, Edward Holiock, and Thomas Makepeace, in behalf of themselves and the other partners of the two patents; by which instrument they resigned the jurisdiction of the whole to Massachusetts, on condition that the inhab|itants should enjoy the same liberties with their own people, and have a court of justice erected among them. The proper|ty of the whole patent of Portsmouth, and of one-third part of that of Dover, and of all the improved lands therein, was re|served to the lords and gentlemen propri|etors, and their heirs forever.</P>
<P>The court on their part consented that<NOTE PLACE="marg">October 8.</NOTE> the inhabitants of these towns should en|joy the same privileges with the rest of the

These commissioners were invested with the power of the quarter courts of Salem and Ipswich, and at their arrival they constituted Francis Williams, Thomas Warnerton and Ambrose Gibbons of Portsmouth, Edward Hilton, Thomas Wiggen and William Waldron of Dover, magistrates, who were confirmed by the general court.</P>
<P>By a subsequent order a very extraor|dinary concession was made to these towns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1642.

<P>After his departure from Exeter, an at|tempt was made by the remaining inhab|itants to form themselves into a church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1644.</NOTE> and call the aged Stephen Batchelor to the ministry, who had been dismissed from Hampton for his irregular conduct.

<P>Such a stretch of power, which would now be looked upon as an infringement of christian liberty, was agreeable to the principles of the first fathers of New-Eng|land, who thought that civil government was established for the defence and secu|rity of the church against error both doc|trinal and moral. In this sentiment they were not singular, it being universally adopted by the reformers, in that and the preceding age, as one of the fundamental principles of their separation from the Ro|mish church, and necessary to curtail the claims of her Pontiff, who assumed a su|premacy over

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Observations on the principles and conduct of the first planters of New-England. Causes of their removal. Their forti|tude. Religious sentiments. Care of their posterity. Justice. Laws. Theo|cratic prejudices. Intolerance and per|secutions.</HEAD>
<P>AN union having been formed between the settlements on Pascataqua and the colony of Massachusetts, their history for the succeeding forty years is in a great measure the same. It is not my intention to write the transactions of the whole col|ony during that period; but, as many of the people in New-Hampshire had the same principles, views and interests with the other people of New-England, I shall make some observations thereon, and in|tersperse such historical facts as may illus|trate the subject.</P>
<P>In the preceding century the holy scrip|tures, which had long lain hid in the rub|bish of monastic libraries, were brought to public view by the happy invention of printing; and as darkness vanishes before the rising sun, so the light of divine truth
<PB N="61" REF="024087_0069_0FC30A0045692D78">
began to dissipate those errors and super|stitions in which Europe had long been involved. At the same time a remarkable concurrence of circumstances gave peculiar advantage to the bold attempt of Luther, to rouse Germany from her inglorious subjection to the Roman Pontiff, and ef|fectuate a reformation, which soon spread into the neighbouring countries. But so intimately were the political interests of kingdoms and states blended with relig|ious prejudices, that the work, though happily begun, was greatly blemished and impeded.</P>
<P>Henry the VIIIth of England took ad|vantage of this amazing revolution in the minds of men, to throw off the papal yoke, and assert his native claim to independence. But so dazzling was the idea of power, and the example of the first christian princes, who had exercised a superintendency in spirituals, as well as temporals, that he transferred to himself that spiritual power which had been usurped and exercised by the bishops of Rome, and set up himself as supreme head on earth of the church of England; commanding both clergy and laity in his dominions to swear allegiance to him in this newly assumed character.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="024087_0070_0FC30A016D70C060">This claim was kept up by his son and successor Edward the Sixth, in whose reign the reformation gained much ground; and a service-book was published by royal au|thority as the standard of worship and dis|cipline for his subjects. This excellent prince was taken out of the world in his youth; and his sister Mary, who then came to the throne, restored the supremacy to the pope, and raised such fiery persecu|tion against the reformers, that many of them fled into Germany and the Nether|lands; where they departed from that uniformity which had been established in England, and became divided in their sen|timents and practice respecting ecclesiasti|cal affairs: the native effect of that just liberty of conscience which they enjoyed abroad, pursuing their own inquiries ac|cording to their respective measures of light; uninfluenced by secular power, or the hope of acquiring dignities in a na|tional establishment.</P>
<P>The accession of Elizabeth inspired them with new hopes; and they returned home, resolving to attempt the reformation of the church of England, agreeably to the re|spective opinions which they had embrac|ed in their exile. But they soon found that the queen, who had been educated in
<PB N="63" REF="024087_0071_0FC30A0AE9927C90">
the same manner with her brother Ed|ward, was fond of the establishment made in his reign, and was strongly prejudiced in favor of pomp and ceremony in relig|ious worship. She asserted her supremacy in the most absolute terms, and erected an high-commission court with jurisdiction in ecclesiastical affairs. Uniformity being rigorously enjoined and no abatement or allowance made for tender consciences (though it was conceded that the ceremo|nies were indifferent) a separtion from the establishment took place. Those who were desirous of a farther reformation from the Romish superstitions, and of a more pure and perfect form of Religion were deno|minated <HI>Puritans;</HI> whose principles, as distinguished from those of the other re|formers who were in favor with the queen, are thus represented.</P>
<P><Q>The queen and court-reformers held, 1. That every prince had the sole author|ity to correct all abuses of doctrine and worship within his own territories. 2. That the church of Rome was a true church though corrupt in some points of doctrine and government;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neal's Hist. Puritans, vol. 1. p. 95.98. 4to.</NOTE> that all her ministra|tions were valid, and that the pope was a true bishop of Rome though not of the universal church. 3. That the scriptures
<PB N="64" REF="024087_0072_0FC30A0D4DF19098">
were a perfect rule of faith, but not a standard of discipline; and that it was left to the discretion of the christian magistrate, to accommodate the government of the church to the policy of the state. 4. That the practice of the primitive church for the first four or five centuries was a proper standard of church government and disci|pline; and in some respects better than that of the apostles, which was only ac|commodated to the infant state of the church, while it was under persecution; whereas the other was suited to the gran|deur of a national establishment. 5. That things indifferent in their own nature as rites, ceremonies, and habits, might be settled, determined and made necessary by the command of the civil magistrate, and that in such cases it was the duty of the subject to observe them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>On the other hand, the puritans, 1. Disowned all foreign jurisdiction over the church, but could not admit of that exten|sive power which the crown claimed by the supremacy. However, they took the oath, with the queen's explication, as only restoring her majesty to the ancient and natural rights of soverign princes over their subjects. 2. They held the pope to be antichrist, the church of Rome a false
<PB N="65" REF="024087_0073_0FC30A105DDC8800">
church, and all her ministrations supersti|tious and idolatrous. 3. That the scrip|tures were a standard of discipline as well as doctrine, and if there was need of a dis|cretionary power, it was vested not in the magistrate but in the officers of the church. 4. That the form of government ordained by the apostles was aristocratical, and de|signed as a pattern to the church in after ages, not to be departed from in its main principles. 5. That those things which Christ hath left indifferent ought not to be made necessary; and that such rites and ceremonies as had been abused to ido|latry and superstition, and had a manifest tendency to lead men back thereto, were no longer indifferent but unlawful.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Both parties agreed too well in assert|ing the necessity of uniformity in public worship, and of using the sword of the magistrate for the support and defence of their respective principles; which they made an ill use of in their turns, whenever they could grasp it in their hands. The standard of uniformity according to the bishops, was the queen's supremacy and the laws of the land; according to the puritans, the decrees of national and pro|vincial synods, allowed and enforced by the civil magistrate. Neither party were
<PB N="66" REF="024087_0074_0FC30A12A14D73A0">
for admitting that liberty of conscience and freedom of profession which is every man's right, so far as is consistent with the peace of civil government. Upon this fatal rock of <HI>uniformity,</HI> was the peace of the church of England split.</Q></P>
<P>It is melancholy to observe what mis|chiefs were caused by the want of a just dis|tinction between civil and ecclesiastical power, and by that absurd zeal for uniform|ity, which kept the nation in a long fer|ment, and at length burst out into a blaze, the fury of which was never thoroughly quelled till the happy genius of the revoluti|on gave birth to a free and equitable <HI>tolerati|on,</HI> whereby every man was restored to the natural right of judging and acting for himself in matters of religion. All the celebrated wisdom of Elizabeth's govern|ment could not devise an expedient so suc|cessful. Though her reign was long and prosperous, yet it was much stained with oppression and cruelty toward many of her best subjects; who, wearied with ineffec|tual applications, waited the accession of James, from whom they expected more favour, because he had been educated in the presbyterian church of Scotland, and professed an high veneration for that esta|blishment. But they soon found that he
<PB N="67" REF="024087_0075_0FC30A14D1160218">
had changed his religious principles with his climate, and that nothing was to be ex|pected from a prince of so base a character, but insult and contempt.</P>
<P>In the beginning of his reign a great number of the puritans removed into Hol|land, where they formed churches upon their own principles. But not relishing the manners of the Dutch, after twelve years they projected a removal to America, and laid the foundation of the colony of Plymouth. The spirit of uniformity still prevailing in England, and being carried to the greatest extent in the reign of Charles the First by that furious bigot Archbishop Laud; many of the less scrupulous, but conscientious members of the church of England, who had hitherto remained in her communion, seeing no prospect of rest or liberty in their native country, follow|ed their brethren to America, and establish|ed the colony of Massachusetts, from which proceeded that of Connecticut.</P>
<P>By such men, influenced by such motives, were the principal settlements in New-England effected. The fortitude and perseverance which they exhibited therein will always render their memory dear to their posterity. To prepare for their enterprize, they had to sell their
<PB N="68" REF="024087_0076_0FC30A189EB4DED0">
estates, some of which were large and valu|able, and turn them into materials for a new plantation, with the nature of which they had no acquaintance, and of which they could derive no knowledge from the expe|rience of others. After traversing a wide ocean they found themselves in a country full of woods, to subdue which required immense labour and patience; at a vast distance from any civilized people; in the neighbourhood of none but ignorant and barbarous savages; and in a climate, where a winter much more severe than they had been accustomed to, reigns for a third part of the year. Their stock of provisions falling short, they had the dreadful apprehension of perishing by famine, one half of their number dying before the first year was completed; the ocean on one side separated them from their friends, and the wilderness on the other, presented nothing but scenes of hor|ror, which it was impossible for them to conceive of before they endured them.</P>
<P>But under all these difficulties, they maintained a steady and pious resolution; depending on the providence of the supreme ruler, and never repenting the business on which they had come into this wilderness. As purity in divine administrations was the
<PB N="69" REF="024087_0077_0FC30A22E5FBBD58">
professed object of their undertaking, so they immediately set themselves to form churches, on what they judged the gos|pel plan. To be out of the reach of pre|latic tyranny, and at full liberty to pur|sue their own enquiries, and worship God according to their consciences, (which had been denied them in their own country) was esteemed the greatest of blessings, and sweetened every bitter cup which they were obliged to drink. They always professed that their principal design was to erect churches on the primitive model, and that the consideration of temporal interest and conveniency had but the second place in their views.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>It concerneth New-England always to remember, that they are originally a plantation religious, not a plantation of trade.

And if any man among us make religion as twelve, and the world as thirteen, such an one hath not the spirit of a true New-Englandman.</Q>
<BIBL>Higginson's Election Sermon, 1663.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>In the doctrinal points of religion they were of the same mind with their brethren of the church of England, as expressed in their articles. The Massachusetts planters left behind them, when they sailed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. Hist. vol. I. p. 487.</NOTE> a re|spectful declaration importing that they did not consider the church of England as antichristian, but only withdrew from the
<PB N="70" REF="024087_0078_0FC30A273658CBC8">
imposition of unscriptural terms of com|munion. Some of the Plymouth planters had embraced the narrow principles of the Brownists, the first who separated from the church of England; but by the improve|ments which they made in religious know|ledge under the instruction of the renown|ed John Robinson, their pastor in Holland, they were in a great measure cured of that sour leaven. The congregational system of church government was the result of the studies of that truly pious, learned, humble and benevolent divine, who seems to have had more of the genuine spirit of the reformation, and of freedom from bi|gotry, than any others in his day. His farewell charge to those of his flock who were embarking in Holland for America deserves to be had in perpetual remem|brance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neal's Hist. N. Eng. vol. I. p. 84.</NOTE>

The Lu|therans cannot be drawn to go beyond what Luther saw; whatever part of his will our good God has revealed to Cal|vin, they will rather die than embrace it. And the Calvinists you see stick fast where they were left by that great man of God, who yet saw not all things. This is a misery much to be lamented; for though they were burning and shining lights in their times, yet they penetrated not in|to the whole counsel of God; but were they now living, would be as willing to embrace farther light, as that which they at first received. I beseech you to re|member it is an article of your church covenant, <HI>That you be ready to receive whatever truth shall be made known to you from the written word of God.</HI> Re|member that, and every other article of your sacred covenant.

exhort you to take heed what you receive as truth.

It is much to be regretted that this excellent man did not live to reach New-England and to diffuse more gene|rally such truly catholic and apostolic prin|ciples.</P>
<P>Many of the first planters of New-England were persons of good education, and some of them eminent for their abi|lities and learning. Such men could not but see the necessity of securing to their posterity the advantages which they had so dearly purchased. One of their first concerns was to have their children considered, from their earliest years, as subjects of ecclesiastical discipline. This became a matter of controversy, and was largely discussed in sermons and pam|phlets, and at length determined by the au|thority of a synod. A regular course of academical learning was a point of equal importa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, and admitted of no dispute. They saw that the reputation and happi|ness
<PB N="73" REF="024087_0081_0FC30A2CDD5362A0">
of the whole country depended great|ly upon it. They therefore took early care for the establishment of schools, and within ten years from their first settlement, founded a college at Cambridge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>When New-England was poor, and we were but few in number, there was a spirit to encourage learning, and the col|lege was full of students.</Q>

with merely living peaceably among them, but exerted themselves vigorously in en|deavouring their conversion to christianity, which was one of the obligations of their patent, and one of the professed designs of their settlement in this country. This painful work was remarkably succeeded, and the names of ELIOT and MAYHEW will always be remembered as unwearied instruments in promoting it. Great care was taken by the government to prevent fraud and injustice toward the Indians in trade, or violence to their persons.

rebellion against parents, and conspiracy against the commonwealth were made ca|pital crimes; and because some doubted whether the magistrate could punish breaches of the four first commands of the decalogue, this right was asserted in the highest tone, and the denial of it ranked among the most pestilent heresies, and pu|nished with banishment. By the severity and impartiality with which those laws were executed, intemperance and profane|ness were so effectually discountenanced that Hugh Peters, who had resided in the country twenty years, declared before the parliament that he had not seen a drunk|en man, nor heard a profane oath during that period. The report of this extraor|dinary strictness, while it invited many of the best men in England to come over, kept them clear of those wretches who fly from one country to another to escape the punishment of their crimes.</P>
<P>The professed design of the plantation being the advancement of religion, and men of the strictest morals being appoint|ed to the chief places of government, their zeal for purity of every kind carried them into some refinements in their laws which are not generally supposed to come with|in the sphere of magistracy, and in larger

communities could scarcely be attended to in a judicial way. The drinking of healths, and the use of tobacco were forbidden, the former being considered as an heathenish and idolatrous practice, grounded on the ancient libations; the other as a species of intoxication and waste of time. Laws were instituted to regulate the intercourse be|tween the sexes, and the advances toward matrimony: They had a ceremony of be|trothing, which preceded that of marriage. Pride and levity of behavior came under the cognizance of the magistrate. Not only the richness but the mode of dress, and cut of the hair were subject to state-regulations. Women were forbidden to expose their arms or bosoms to view; it was ordered that their sleeves should reach down to their wrist, and their gowns be closed round the neck. Men were obliged to cut short their hair, that they might not resemble women. No person not worth two hundred pounds was allowed to wear gold or silver lace, or silk hoods and scarfs. Offences against these laws were presentable by the grand jury; and those who dressed above their rank were to be assessed accordingly. Sumptuary laws might be of use in the beginning of a new plantation; but these pious rulers had
<PB N="78" REF="024087_0086_0FC30A4961842B70">
more in view than the political good. They were not only concerned for the ex|ternal appearance of sobriety and good order, but thought themselves obliged, so far as they were able, to promote real re|ligion and enforce the observance of the divine precepts.</P>
<P>As they were fond of imagining a near resemblance between the circumstances of their settlement in this country and the redemption of Israel from Egypt or Baby|lon; it is not strange that they should also look upon their
<Q>commonwealth as an institution of God for the preservation of their churches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Increase Mather's life, p. 57.</NOTE> and the civil rulers as both members and fathers of them.</Q>
The famous John Cotton, the first mini|ster in Boston was the chief promoter of this settlement. When he arrived in 1633, he found the people divided in their opi|nions. Some had been admitted to the privileges of freemen at the first general court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mather's Magnalia, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b. 3. p. 20.</NOTE> who were not in communion with the churches; after this an order was passed, that none but members of the churches should be admitted freemen; whereby all other persons were excluded from every office or privilege civil or mi|litary. This great man by his eloquence confirmed those who had embraced this
<PB N="79" REF="024087_0087_0FC30A4B0B857680">
opinion, and earnestly pleaded
<Q>that the government might be considered as a theocracy wherein the Lord was judge, lawgiver and king; that the laws which he gave Israel might be adopted, so far as they were of moral and perpetual equity; that the people might be consider|ed as God's people in covenant with him; that none but persons of approved piety and eminent gifts should be chosen rulers; that the ministers should be consulted in all matters of religion; and that the magistrate should have a superintending and c&ouml;ercive power over the churches.</Q>
At the desire of the court, he compiled a system of laws founded chiefly on the laws of Moses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch&middot; Collect. papers, p. 161.</NOTE> which was considered by the legislative body as the general standard; though they never formally adopted it and in some instances varied from it.</P>
<P>These principles were fundamentally the same with those on which were ground|ed all the persecutions which they had en|dured in England, and naturally led to the same extremes of conduct which they had so bitterly complained of in those civil and ecclesiastical rulers, from whose tyran|ny they had fled into this wilderness. They had already proceeded a step farther than the hierarchy had ever attempted.

<P>In consequence of the union thus form|ed between the church and state on the plan of the Jewish theocracy, the ministers were called to sit in council, and give their ad|vice in matters of religion and cases of conscience which came before the court, and without them they never proceeded to any act of an ecclesiastical nature. As none were allowed to vote in the election

of rulers but freemen, and freemen must be church members; and as none could be admitted into the church but by the elders, who first examined, and then pro|pounded them to the brethren for their vote, the clergy acquired hereby a vast ascendency over both rulers and people, and had in effect the keys of the state as well as the church in their hands. The magistrates, on the other hand, regulated the gathering of churches, interposed in the settlement and dismission of ministers, arbitrated in ecclesiastical controversies and controled synodical assemblies. This c&ouml;|ercive power in the magistrate was deem|ed absolutely necessary to preserve
<Q>the order of the gospel.</Q></P>
<P>The principle on which this power is grounded is expressed in the Cambridge Platform in terms as soft as possible.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 17. Sect. 3.</NOTE>
<Q>The power and authority of magistrates is not for the restraining of churches, or any other <HI>good</HI> works, but for the helping in and furthering thereof, and therefore the consent and countenance of magi|strates <HI>when it may be had,</HI> is not to be slighted or lightly esteemed; but, on the contrary, it is a part of the honor due to christian magistrates to desire and crave their consent and approbation
<PB N="82" REF="024087_0090_0FC30A5622F57298">
therein: which being obtained, the churches may then proceed in their way with <HI>much more</HI> encouragement and comfort.</Q>
This article (like divers o|thers in that work) is curiously and artful|ly drawn up, so that there is an appearance of liberty and tenderness but none in reali|ty: For although the magistrate was not to restrain any good works, yet <HI>he</HI> was to be the judge of the good or evil of the works to be restrained; and what security could churches have that they should not be restrained in the performance of what <HI>they</HI> judged to be good works? They might indeed think themselves safe, while their rulers were so zealous for the purity of the churches of which themselves were mem|bers, and while their ministers were con|sulted in all ecclesiastical affairs; but if the civil powers had acted without such con|sultation, or if the ministers had been in|duced to yield to the opinion of the ma|gistrates, when contrary to the interest of the churches, what then would have be|come of religious liberty?</P>
<P>The idea of liberty in matters of religi|on was in that day strangely understood, and mysteriously expressed. The venera|ble Higginson of Salem in his sermon on the day of the election 1663, speaks thus;
<PB N="83" REF="024087_0091_0FC30A5F582970A8">
<Q>The gospel of Christ hath a right para|mount all rights in the world; it hath a divine and supreme right to be receiv|ed in every nation, and the knee of ma|gistracy is to bow at the name of Jesus. This right carries liberty along with it, for all such as profess the gospel, to walk according to the faith and order of the gospel. That which is contrary to the gospel hath no right, and therefore should have no liberty.</Q>
Here the question arises, Who is to be the judge of what is agreeable or cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ary to the gospel? If the magistrate, then there is only a liberty to believe and practise what the magistrate thinks right. A similar sentiment occurs in the sermon of the learned President Oakes on the same occasion in 1673;
<Q>The outcry of some is for liberty of con|science. This is the great Diana of the libertines of this age. But remember that as long as you have liberty to walk in the faith and order of the gospel, and may lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godliness and honesty, you have as much liberty of conscience as Paul de|sired under any government.</Q>
Here the question recurs, Would Paul have sub|mitted to walk according to the opinion which the magistrate might entertain of
<PB N="84" REF="024087_0092_0FC30A65C5640910">
the faith and order of the gospel? But this was all the freedom allowed by the spirit of these times. Liberty of conscience and toleration were offensive terms, and they who used them were supposed to be the enemies of religion and government.
<Q>I look upon toleration (says the same au|thor) as the first-born of all abominati|ons; if it should be born and brought forth among us, you may call it Gad, and give the same reason that Leah did for the name of her son, <HI>Behold a troop cometh,</HI> a troop of all manner of abo|minations.</Q>
In another of these election sermons,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hephard's Election Sermon, 1672.</NOTE> (which may generally be account|ed the echo of the public voice, or the po|litical pulse by which the popular opinion may be felt) it is shrewdly intimated that toleration had its origin from the devil, and the speech of the demoniac who cried out,
<Q>what have we to do with thee, let us alone, thou Jesus of Nazareth,</Q>
is styled "Satan's plea for toleration." The following admonition to posterity, written by the Deputy-Governor Dudley, is ano|ther specimen.</P>
<Q><L><NOTE PLACE="marg">Morton's Memorial, p. 179.</NOTE>"Let men of God in courts and churches watch"</L>

<L>"To poison all with heresy and vice.</L>
<L>"If men be left and otherwise combine</L>
<L>"My epitaph's <HI>I die no libertine.</HI>"</L></Q>
<P>The champion of these sentiments was Cotton, who though eminently meek, placid and charitable, yet was strongly tinctured with the prevailing opinion, That the magistrate had a c&ouml;ercive power against heretics. The banishment of Ro|ger Williams, minister of Salem, occasion|ed a vehement controversy on this point. Williams having written in favour of li|berty of conscience, and styled the opposite principle "the bloody tenet;" was an|swered by Cotton, who published a treatise in 1647 with this strange title,
<Q>The bloody tenet washed, and made white in the blood of the Lamb.</Q>
In this work he labours to prove the lawfulness of the magistrate's using the civil sword to extir|pate heretics, from the commands given to the Jews to put to death blasphemers and idolaters. To the objection, that per|secution serves to make men hypocrites, he says,
<Q>better tolerate hypocrites and tares than briars and thorns. In such cases the civil sword doth not so much attend the conversion of seducers, as the preventing the seduction of honest minds
<PB N="86" REF="024087_0094_0FC30A6C2F390510">
by their means.</Q>
He allows indeed that
<Q>the magistrate ought not to draw the sword against seducers till he have used all good means for their conviction: But if after their continuance in obsti|nate rebellion against the light, he shall still walk toward them in soft and gentle commiseration, his softness and gentle|ness is excessive large to foxes and wolves; but his bowels are miserably straitned and hardned against the poor sheep and lambs of Christ. Nor is it frustrating the end of Christ's coming, which was to save souls, but a direct ad|vancing it, to destroy, if need be, the bodies of those wolves, who seek to de|stroy the souls of those for whom Christ died.</Q>
In pursuing his argument he refines so far as to deny that any man is to be persecuted on account of conscience
<Q>till being convinced in his conscience of his wickedness, he do stand out therein, not only against the truth, but against the light of his own conscience, that so it may appear he is not persecuted for cause of conscience, but punished for sinning against his own conscience.</Q>
To which he adds,
<Q>sometimes it may be an aggravation of sin both in judgment and practice that a man committeth it in
<PB N="87" REF="024087_0095_0FC30A6D64C98E88">
conscience.</Q>
After having said that
<Q>it was toleration which made the world antichristian,</Q>
he concludes his book with this singular ejaculation,
<Q>the Lord keep us from being bewitched with the whore's cup, lest while we seem to reject her with open face of profession, we bring her in by a back door of tolerati|on; and so come to drink deeply of the cup of the Lord's wrath, and be filled with her plagues.</Q></P>
<P>But the strangest language that ever was used on this or perhaps on any other subject, is to be found in a book printed in 1645 by the humourous Ward of Ip|swich entitled
<Q>the Simple Cobler of A|gawam.</Q>
<Q>My heart (says he) hath naturally detested four things; the stand|ing of the Apocrypha in the bible: foreigners dwelling in my country, to croud out native subjects into the cor|ners of the east: alchymized coins: toleration of divers religions or of one religion in segregant shapes. He that willingly assents to the last, if he ex|amines his heart by day-light, his con|science will tell him, he is either an atheist, or an heretic, or an hypocrite, or at best a captive to some lust. Poly|piety is the greatest impiety in the
<PB N="88" REF="024087_0096_0FC30A6EDF697930">
world. To authorize an untruth by to|leration of the state, is to build a sconce against the walls of heaven, to batter God out of his chair. Persecution of true religion and toleration of false are the Jannes and Jambres to the kingdom of Christ, whereof the last is by far the worst. He that is willing to tolerate any un|sound opinion, that his own may be to|lerated though never so sound, will for a need, hang God's bible at the devil's girdle. It is said that men ought to have liberty of conscience and that it is persecution to debar them of it: I can rather stand amazed than reply to this; it is an astonishment that the brains of men should be parboiled in such impious ignorance.</Q></P>
<P>From these specimens, (of which the reader will think he has had enough) it is easy to see how deeply the principle of intolerancy was rooted in the minds of our forefathers. Had it stood only in their books as a sub|ject of speculation, it might have been excused, considering the prejudices of the times; but it was drawn out into fatal practice, and caused severe persecutions which cannot be justified consistently with christianity or true policy. Whatever may be said in favour of their proceedings

against the Antinomians, whose principles had such an effect on the minds of the people as materially affected the founda|tions of government, in the infancy of the plantation; yet the Anabaptists and Qua|kers were so inconsiderable for numbers, and the colony was then so well establish|ed that no danger could have been rati|onally apprehended to the commonwealth from them. Rhode-Island was settled by some of the Antinomian exiles on a plan of entire religious liberty:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Callender's Century Sermon, 1738.</NOTE> men of every denomination being equally protected and countenanced, and enjoying the honours and offices of government. The Ana|baptists, fined and banished, flocked to that new settlement, and many of the Quakers also took refuge there; so that Rhode-Island was in those days looked upon as the drain or sink of New-England; and it has been said that
<Q>if any man had lost his religion, he might find it there, among such a general muster of opinionists.</Q>
Notwithstanding this invective, it is much to the honour of that government that there never was an instance of persecution for conscience sake countenanced by them. Rhode-Island and Pennsylvania afford a strong proof that toleration conduces great|ly to the settlement and increase of an in|fant plantation.</P>

As the flowing of the ocean doth fill every creek and branch thereof, and then retires again toward its own being and fulness and leaves a favour behind it; so doth the life and virtue of God flow into every one of your hearts, whom he hath made partakers of his divine nature; and when it withdraws but a little, it leaves a sweet savour behind it, that many can say they are made clean through the word that he has spoken to them. Therefore, my dear hearts, let the enjoyment of the life alone be your hope, your joy and your consolation. Stand in the watch within, in the fear of the Lord which is the entrance of wisdom. Confess him before men, yea before his greatest ene|mies. Fear not what they can do to you: Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world, for he will clothe you with humility and in the power of his meekness you shall reign over all the rage of your enemies.</Q>

<P>In the reign of Edward the sixth of England, anno 1549,
<Q>A woman called Joan Bocher, or Joan of Kent, was accused of here|tical pravity. Her doctrine was,

A scholastic nicety, not capable of doing much mischief! but there was a necessity for delivering the woman to the flames for maintaining it. The young king though in such tender years, had more sense than all his counsellors and preceptors; and he long refused to sign the warrant for her exe|cution. CRANMER, with his superior learning, was employed to persuade him to compliance, and he said, that the prince, being God's deputy, ought to repress impieties against God. in like man|ner as the king's deputies were bound to punish offenders against the king's person. He also argued from the practice of the Jewish church in stoning blasphemers. Edward overcome by importunity more than reason at last submitted, and told Cranmer with tears in his eyes, that if any wrong was done, the guilt should lie entire|ly on his head. The primate was struck with surprize; but after making a new effort to reclaim the woman and finding her obsti|nate, he at last committed her to the flames. Nor did he ever re|nounce his burning principles so long as he continued in power.</Q>

<P>It ought also to be remembered, that at the same time that the Quakers suffered in New-England, penal laws against them were made and rigorously executed in England; and though none of them suffered capital executions, yet they were thrown into prison and treated with other marks of cruelty, which in some instances proved the means of their death. And though the lenity of King Charles the IId in putting a stop to capital executions here has been much celebrated, yet in his letter to the Massachusetts government the next year, wherein he requires liberty for the church of Eng|land among them, he adds,
<Q>Wee cannot be understood hereby to direct, or wish that any indulgence should be graunted to Quakers, whose principles, being inconsistent with any kind of government, Wee have found it necessary with the advise of our parliament here to make a sharp law against them, and are well content you doe the like there.</Q>

<P>Divers others of the principal actors and abettors of this tragedy lived to see the folly and incompetency of such sanguina|ry laws, to which the sufferings of their brethren, the nonconformists in England, did not a little contribute. Under the ar|bitrary government of King James the second, when he, for a shew of liberty and as a leading step to the introduction of popery, issued a proclamation of indul|gence to tender consciences, the principal men of the country sent him an address of thanks, for granting them what they had formerly denied to others. It is but justice
<PB N="99" REF="024087_0107_0FC303A895B20FD8">
to add, that all those disgraceful laws were renounced and repealed, and the people of New-England are now as candidly dis|posed toward the Quakers as any other denominations of christians.

Their zeal was of the same kind; and the answer which the benevo|lent author of our religion gave to his dis|ciples on that occasion, might with equal propriety be addressed to them, and to all persecuting christians,

<P>DURING the union of these planta|tions with Massachusetts, they were governed by the general laws of the co|lony, and the terms of the union were strictly observed.

The first heir named in Mason's will dying in infancy, the e|state descended after the death of the ex|ecutrix to Robert Tufton, who was not of age till 1650.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1652.</NOTE> In two years after this, Joseph Mason came over as agent to the executrix, to look after the interest of her deceased husband. He found the lands at Newichwannock occupied by Richard Leader, against whom he brought actions in the county court of Norfolk; but a dis|pute arising whether the lands in question were within the jurisdiction of Massachu|setts, and the court of Norfolk judging the action not to be within their cognizance, recourse was had to the general court; who on this occasion ordered an accurate survey of the northern bounds of their pa|tent

to be made; a thing which they had long meditated. A committee of the ge|neral court attended by Jonathan Ince and John Shearman surveyors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Massa. Rec.</NOTE> and several In|dian guides, went up the river Merrimack to find the most northerly part thereof, which the Indians told them was at Aque|dochtan, the outlet of the lake Winnipi|seogee. The latitude of this place was ob|served to be 43 degrees 40 minutes and 12 seconds, to which three miles being added, made the line of the patent, accord|ing to their construction, fall within the lake, in the latitude of 43 degrees 43 mi|nutes and 12 seconds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1653.</NOTE> Two experienced ship-masters, Jonas Clarke and Samuel Andrews, were then dispatched to the east|ern coast, who found the same degrees, minutes, and seconds, on the northern point of an island in Casco Bay, called the Upper Clapboard Island. An east and west line, drawn through these points from the Atlantic to the South sea, was there|fore supposed to be the northern boundary of the Massachusetts patent, within which the whole claim of Mason, and the great|er part of that of Gorges were compre|hended. When this grand point was de|termined, the court were of opinion, that
<Q>some lands at Newichwannock, with the
<PB N="104" REF="024087_0112_0FC303BF6AC222F0">
river, were by agreement of Sir Ferdi|nando Gorges and others, apportioned to Captain Mason, and that he also had right by purchase of the Indians, as also by possession and improvement;</Q>
and they ordered
<Q>a quantity of land propor|tionable to his disbursements, with the privilege of the river, to be laid out to his heirs.</Q>
The agent made no attempt to recover any other part of the estate; but having tarried long enough in the country to observe the temper of the go|vernment, and the management used in the determination of his suit, he returned; and the estate was given up for lost unless the government of England should inter|pose.</P>
<P>During the commonwealth, and the protectorate of Cromwell, there could be no hope of relief, as the family had always been attached to the royal cause, and the colony stood high in the favor of the par|liament and of Cromwell. But the resto|ration of King Charles the second encou|raged Tufton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1660.</NOTE> who now took the sirname of Mason, to look up to the throne for fa|vor and assistance. For though the plan of colonization adopted by his grandfather was in itself chimerical, and proved fruit|less, yet he had expended a large estate in
<PB N="105" REF="024087_0113_0FC303C137AE1EB0">
the prosecution of it, which must have been wholly lost to his heirs, unless they could recover the possession of his Ame|rican territories. Full of this idea, Mason petitioned the king; setting forth
<Q>the en|croachment of the Massachusetts colony upon his lands, their making grants and giving titles to the inhabitants, and there|by dispossessing him and keeping him out of his right.</Q>
The king referred the petition to his attorney-general Sir Geof|fry Palmer, who reported that
<Q>Robert Mason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 8. MS in Su. Cour. files.</NOTE> grandson and heir to Capt. John Mason, had a good and legal title to the province of New-Hampshire.</Q>
Nothing farther was done at this time, nor was the matter mentioned in the letter which the king soon after sent to the colony, though some offensive things in their conduct were therein reprehended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1662.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch. Collect. of papers, p. 377.</NOTE> and divers alterations enjoined. But the directions contained in this letter not being strictly attended to, and complaints being made to the king of disputes which had arisen in divers parts of New-England concerning the limits of jurisdiction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch. Hist. Mas. vol. 1. p. 535.</NOTE> and addresses having been pre|sented by several persons, praying for the royal interposition; a commission was issued under the great seal to Colonel Richard Nichols, Sir Robert Carre, knight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1664.

<Q>to visit the several co|lonies of New-England; to examine and determine all complaints and ap|peals in matters civil, military and cri|minal; to provide for the peace and se|curity of the country, according to their good and sound discretion, and to such instructions as they should receive from the king, and to certify him of their pro|ceedings.</Q></P>
<P>This commission was highly disrelished by the colony, as inconsistent with the rights and privileges which they enjoyed by their charter, and which the king had sacredly promised to confirm. It is there|fore no wonder that the commissioners were treated with much coolness at their arrival;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch. Colle. pap. 417.</NOTE> but they severely repaid it in their report to the king.</P>
<P>In their progress through the country they came to Pascataqua,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1665. June.</NOTE> and enquired into the bounds of Mason's patent. They heard the allegation of Whelewright, who when banished by the colony, was per|mitted to reside immediately beyond what was called the bound-house, which was three large miles to the northward of the river Merrimack. They took the affidavit of Henry Jocelyn concerning the agree|ment
<PB N="107" REF="024087_0115_0FC303C7B534F0F0">
between Governor Cradock and Captain Mason, that the river should be the boundary of their respective patents. They made no determination of this con|troversy in their report to the king; but having called together the inhabitants of Portsmouth, Sir Robert Carre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mass. Rec. Octo. 10.</NOTE> in the name of the rest, told them that
<Q>they would release them from the government of Massachusetts whose jurisdiction should come no farther than the bound-house.</Q>
They then proceeded to appoint justices of the peace and other officers, with power to act according to the laws of England, and such laws of their own as were not repugnant thereto,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. Collection pap. 488.</NOTE> until the king's plea|sure should be farther known.</P>
<P>There had always been a party here who were dissaffected to the government of Massachusetts. One of the most active a|mong them was Abraham Corbett of Ports|mouth, who, since the arrival of the com|missioners at Boston, and probably by authority derived from them, had taken upon him to issue warrants in the king's name on several occasions, which was con|strued a high misdemeanor, as he had never been commissioned by the authority of the colony. Being called to account by the general court, he was admonished,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Massa. Rec.</NOTE> fined
<PB N="108" REF="024087_0116_0FC303C9327F98D8">
five pounds, and committed till the sen|tence was performed. Irritated by this severity, he was the fitter instrument for the purpose of the commissioners, who em|ployed him to frame a petition to the king in the name of the four towns, complain|ing of the usurpation of Massachusetts over them, and praying to be released from their tyranny. Corbett, in a secret manner, procured several persons both in Ports|mouth and Dover to subscribe this petition, but the most of those to whom he offered it refused.</P>
<P>The sensible part of the inhabitants now saw with much concern that they were in danger of being reduced to the same un|happy state which they had been in before their union with the colony. Awed by the supercilious behaviour of the commis|sioners, they knew not at first how to act; for to oppose the king's authority was con|strued treason, and it was said that Sir Robert Carre had threatened a poor old man with death for no other crime than forbidding his grandchild to open a door to them. But when the rumour was spread that a petition was drawn, and that Corbett was procuring subscribers, the people, no longer able to bear the abuse, earnestly applied to the general court, praying
<PB N="109" REF="024087_0117_0FC303D72689D458">
<Q>that in some orderly way they might have an opportunity to clear themselves of so great and unjust aspersions, as were by this petition, drawn in their name, cast upon the government under which they were settled; and also to manifest their sense of such perfidious actions, lest by their silence it should be concluded they were of the same mind with those who framed the petition.</Q>
In conse|quence of this petition, the court commis|sioned Thomas Danforth, Eleazar Lusher, and Major General Leverett to enquire in|to the matter, and settle the peace in these places according to their best discretion.</P>
<P>These gentlemen came to Portsmouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October 9.</NOTE> and having assembled the inhabitants, and published their commission, they told them that they were informed of a petition sub|scribed in behalf of that and the neigh|bouring towns, complaining of the go|vernment; and desired them if they had any just grievances to let them be known, and report should be immediately made to the general court. The next day they assembled the people of Dover and made the same challenge. Both towns respec|tively protested against the petition, and professed full satisfaction with the govern|ment, which they signified in addresses to
<PB N="110" REF="024087_0118_0FC303D8E5FB8A90">
the court. Dudley, the minister of Exe|ter, certified under his hand to the com|mittee, that the people of that town had no concern directly nor indirectly with the obnoxious petition. They received also full satisfaction with regard to Hampton; a certificate of which might have been ob|tained, if they had thought it necessary.</P>
<P>They then proceeded to summon Cor|bett before them for seditious behaviour; but he eluded the search that was made for him, and they were obliged to leave a warrant with an officer to cite him to the court at Boston. The commissioners had now gone over into the province of Maine, from whence Sir Robert Carre in their name sent a severe reprimand to this com|mittee, forbidding them to proceed against such persons as had subscribed the petition, and inclosing a copy of a letter which the said commissioners had written to the go|vernor and council on the same subject.</P>
<P>The committee returned and reported their proceedings to the court, and about the same time the commissioners came from their eastern tour to Boston; where the court desired a conference with them, but received such an answer from Sir Ro|bert Carre as determined them not to re|peat their request. A warrant was then
<PB N="111" REF="024087_0119_0FC303DFF5023C78">
issued by the secretary, in the name of the whole court, to apprehend Corbett and bring him before the governor and ma|gistrates,
<Q>to answer for his tumultuous and seditious practices against the go|vernment.</Q>
The next spring he was seized and brought before them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1666. May 23.</NOTE> and af|ter a full hearing was adjudged guilty of sedition, and exciting others to discontent with the government and laws, and of keeping a disorderly house of entertain|ment, for which crimes he was sentenced to give a bond of one hundred pounds with security for his peaceable behaviour and obedience to the laws; he was prohi|bited retailing liquors; disabled from bear|ing any office in the town or common|wealth, during the pleasure of the court; and obliged to pay a fine of twenty pounds and five pounds for the costs of his prose|cution.</P>
<P>This severity in vindication of their charter-rights they thought fit to temper with something that had the appearance of submission to the royal commands. The king's pleasure had been signified to the commissioners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. Collect. pap. 419.</NOTE> that the harbours should be fortified. This instruction came to hand while they were at Pascataqua, and they immediately issued warrants to the
<PB N="112" REF="024087_0120_0FC303E3D1925638">
four towns, requiring them to meet at a time and place appointed to receive his majesty's orders. One of these warrants was sent by express to Boston, from whence two officers were dispatched by the governor and council to forbid the towns on their peril to meet, or obey the commands of the commissioners. But by their own authority they ordered a com|mittee to look out the most convenient place for a fortification, upon whose report
<Q>the neck of land on the eastward of the Great Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Massa. Rec.</NOTE> where a small fort had been already built, was sequestered for the purpose, taking in the Great Rock, and from thence all the easterly part of the said island.</Q>
The court of associates being impowered to hear and determine the claims of those who pretended any title to this land; a claim was entered by George Walton, but rejected; and the ap|propriation confirmed. The customs and imposts on goods imported into the har|bour were applied to the maintenance of the fort, and the trained bands of Great-Island and Kittery-Point were discharged from all other duty to attend the service of it, under Richard Cutts, esq. who was appointed captain.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="024087_0121_0FC303E9355AB4E8">The people of Massachusetts have, both in former and latter times, been charged with disloyalty to the king in their con|duct toward these commissioners, and their disregard of authority derived from the same source with their charter. To ac|count for their conduct on this occasion, we must consider the ideas they had of their political connexion with the parent state. They had been forced from thence by per|secution: they came at their own charges into a wilderness, claimed indeed by the crown of England; but really in possession of its native lords; from whom they had purchased the soil and sovereignty, which gave them a title, considered in a moral view, superior to the grant of any Euro|pean prince. For convenience only, they had solicited and accepted a patent from the crown, which in their opinion constituted the only bond of union between them and their prince, by which the nature and ex|tent of their allegiance to him was to be determined. This patent they regarded as a solemn compact, wherein the king had granted them undisturbed possession of the soil, and power of government within certain limits; on condition that they should settle the country, chris|tianize the natives, yield a fifth of all gold
<PB N="114" REF="024087_0122_0FC303F2D28D63C0">
and silver mines to the crown, and make no laws repugnant to those of England. They had, on their part, sacredly perform|ed these conditions; and therefore con|cluded that the grant of title, property and dominion which the crown had made to them was irrevocable. And although they acknowledged themselves subjects of the reigning prince, and owned a dependence on the royal authority; yet they under|stood it to be only through the medium of their charter.</P>
<P>The appointment of commissioners who were to act within the same limits, inde|pendently of this authority, and to receive appeals from it; whose rule of conduct was no established law, but their own "good and sound discretion," was regard|ed as a dangerous stretch of royal power, militating with and superseding their char|ter. If the royal authority was destined to flow through the patent, it could not regularly be turned into another channel: if they were to be governed by laws made and executed by officers of their own choosing, they could not at the same time be governed by the "discretion" of men in whose appointment they had no voice, and over whom they had no control. Two ruling powers in the same state was a so|lecism
<PB N="115" REF="024087_0123_0FC303F4ACBB56F8">
which they could not digest. The patent was neither forfeited nor revoked; but the king had solemnly promised to confirm it, and it subsisted in full force. The commission therefore was deemed an usurpation and infringement of those char|tered rights, which had been solemnly pledged on the one part, dearly purchased and justly paid for on the other. They regarded "a royal donation under the great seal (to use their own words)
<Q>as the greatest security that could be had in hu|man affairs;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch. Hist. Mass. Vol. I. p. 54<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></Q>
and they had confidence in the justice of the supreme ruler, that if they held what they in their consciences thought to be their rights, and performed the engagements by which they had ac|quired them, they should enjoy the pro|tection of his providence, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Keep to your patent.

<P>These were the principles which they
<PB N="116" REF="024087_0124_0FC303F643670C48">
had imbibed, which they openly a|vowed and on which they acted. Policy might have dictated to them the same flexibility of conduct, and softness of ex|pression, by which the other colonies on this occasion gained the royal favour. But they had so long held the sole and unin|terrupted sovereignty, in which they had been indulged by the late popular govern|ment in England; and were so fully con|vinced it was their right; that they chose rather to risque the loss of all, than to make any concessions; thereby exposing themselves farther to the malice of their enemies and the vengeance of power.</P>
<P>The commissioners, having finished their business, were recalled by the order of the king, who was much displeased with the ill treatment they had received from the Massachusetts government, which was the more heinous, as the colonies of Plymouth, Rhode-Island and Connecticut had treated the commission with acknowledged respect. By a letter to the colony he commanded them to send over four or five agents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 10. Hutch. p. 547.</NOTE> pro|mising
<Q>to hear in person, all the allega|tions, suggestions, and pretences to right or favour, that could be made on behalf of the colony,</Q>
intimating that he was far from desiring to invade their charter;
<PB N="117" REF="024087_0125_0FC3040406152CB8">
and commanding that all things should remain as the commissioners had settled them until his farther order; and that those persons who had been imprisoned for petitioning or applying to them should be released. The court, however, conti|nued to exercise jurisdiction, appoint offi|cers, and execute the laws in these towns as they had done for twenty-five years, to the general satisfaction of the people who were united with them in principles and affection.</P>
<P>This affection was demonstrated by their ready concurrence with the proposal for a general collection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1669.</NOTE> for the purpose of erect|ing a new brick building <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This building was erected in 1672, and consumed by fire in 1764.</NOTE> at Harvard col|lege, the old wooden one being small and decayed.

Many complaints were made a|gainst the government of Massachusetts; and it was thought to be highly expedi|ent that more severe measures should be used with them; but the Dutch wars, and other foreign transactions, prevented any determination concerning them, till the country was involved in all the horrors of a general war with the natives.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Remarks on the temper and manners of the Indians. The first general war with them called Philip's war.</HEAD>
<P>AT the time of the first discovery of the river Pascataqua by Captain Smith, it was found that the native inha|bitants of these parts differed not in lan|guage, manners, nor government, from their eastern or western neighbours. Though they were divided into several tribes, each of which had a distinct sachem, yet they all owned subjection to a sovereign prince, called Bashaba,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smith's Voyage.</NOTE> whose residence was some|where about Pemaquid. It was soon after found that the Tarratenes, who lived far|ther eastward, had invaded his country, surprized and slain him, and all the people in his neighbourhood, and carried off his women, leaving no traces of his authority. Upon which the subordinate sachems, hav|ing no head to unite them, and each one striving for the pre-eminence, made war among themselves; whereby many of their people, and much of their provision were destroyed. When Sir Richard Haw|kins visited the coast in 1615,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gorges's Narrat. p. 17.54.</NOTE> this war was
<PB N="121" REF="024087_0129_0FC3040FEC9694D0">
at its height; and to this succeeded a pe|stilence, which carried them off in such numbers that the living were not able to bury the dead;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince's Annals. 1617.</NOTE> but their bones remained at the places of their habitations for several years. During this pestilence, Richard Vines and several others, whom Sir Fer|dinando Gorges had hired, at a great ex|pence, to tarry in the country through the winter, lived among them and lodged in their cabbins, without receiving the least injury in their health,
<Q>not so much as feeling their heads to ach the whole time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gorges, p. 12.</NOTE></Q>
By such singular means did di|vine providence prepare the way for the peaceable entrance of the Europeans into this land.</P>
<P>When the first settlements were made, the remains of two tribes had their habi|tations on the several branches of the river Pascataqua; one of their sachems lived at the falls of Squamscot, and the other at those of Newichwannock; their head quar|ters being generally seated in places con|venient for fishing. Both these, together with several inland tribes, who resided at Pantucket and Winnipiseogee, acknow|ledged subjection to Passaconaway the great sagamore of Pannukog, or (as it is com|monly pronounced) Penacook. He excel|led
<PB N="122" REF="024087_0130_0FC304128A5EF7E0">
the other sachems in sagacity, dupli|city and moderation; but his principal qualification was his skill in some of the secret operations of nature, which gave him the reputation of a sorcerer, and ex|tended his fame and influence among all the neighbouring tribes. They believed that it was in his power to make water burn, and trees dance, and to metamor|phose himself into flame;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch. Hist. Mass. Vol 1. p&middot; 174.</NOTE> that in winter he could raise a green leaf from the ashes of a dry one, and a living serpent from the skin of one that was dead.</P>
<P>An English gentleman who had been much conversant among the Indians was invited, in 1660, to a great dance and feast; on which occasion the elderly men, in songs or speeches recite their histories, and deli|ver their sentiments, and advice, to the younger. At this solemnity Passaconaway, being grown old, made his farewell speech to his children and people; in which, as a dying man, he warned them to take heed how they quarrelled with their English neighbours; for though they might do them some damage, yet it would prove the means of their own destruction. He told them that he had been a bitter enemy to the English, and by the arts of sorcery had tried his utmost to hinder

their settlement and increase; but could by no means succeed. This caution perhaps often repeated, had such an effect, that upon the breaking out of the Indian war fifteen years afterward, Wonolanset,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's printed Narrative. p. 9.31.</NOTE> his son and successor, withdrew himself and his people into some remote place, that they might not be drawn into the quarrel.</P>
<P>While the British nations had been dis|tracted with internal convulsions, and had endured the horrors of a civil war, pro|duced by the same causes which forced the planters of New-England to quit the land of their nativity; this wilderness had been to them a quiet habitation. They had struggled with many hardships; but pro|vidence had smiled upon their undertak|ing, their settlements were extended and their churches multiplied. There had been no remarkable quarrel with the savages, except the short war with the Pequods, who dwelt in the south-east par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Con|necticut: They being totally subdued in 1637, the dread and terror of the English kept the other nations quiet for near forty years. During which time the New-England colonies being confederated for their mutual defence, and for maintaining the public peace, took great pains to pro|pagate the gospel among the natives, and
<PB N="124" REF="024087_0132_0FC304172859E520">
bring them to a civilized way of living, which, with respect to some, proved ef|fectual; others refused to receive the mis|sionaries, and remained obstinately preju|diced against the English. Yet the object of their hatred was at the same time the object of their fear; which led them to forbear acts of hostility, and to preserve an outward shew of friendship, to their mutual interest.</P>
<P>Our historians have generally represent|ed the Indians in a most odious light, especially when recounting the effects of their ferocity. Dogs, caitiffs, miscreants and hell-hounds, are the politest names which have been given them by some wri|ters, who seem to be in a passion at the mentioning their cruelties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's Narrative and Mather's Magnalia.</NOTE> and at other times speak of them with contempt. What|ever indulgence may be allowed to those who wrote in times when the mind was vexed with their recent depredations and inhumanities, it ill becomes us to cherish an inveterate hatred of the unhappy na|tives. Religion teaches us a better tem|per, and providence has now put an end to the controversy, by their almost total extirpation. We should therefore proceed with calmness in recollecting their past in|juries, and forming our judgment of their character.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="024087_0133_0FC3041E1E9DDC30">It must be acknowledged that human depravity appeared in these unhappy crea|tures in a most shocking view. The prin|ciples of education and the refinements of civilized life, either lay a check upon our vicious propensities, or disguise our crimes; but among them human wickedness was seen in its naked deformity. Yet, bad as they were, it will be difficult to find them guilty of any crime which cannot be pa|ralleled among civilized nations.</P>
<P>They are always described as remarka|bly <HI>cruel;</HI> and it cannot be denied that this disposition indulged to the greatest ex|cess, strongly marks their character. We are struck with horror, when we hear of their binding the victim to the stake, biting off his nails, tearing out his hair by the roots, pulling out his tongue, boring out his eyes, sticking his skin full of lighted pitch-wood, half roasting him at the fire, and then making him run for their diver|sion, till he faints and dies under the blows which they give him on every part of his body. But is it not as dreadful to read of an unhappy wretch, sewed up in a sack full of serpents and thrown into the sea, or broiled in a red hot iron chair; or mangled by lions and tygers after having spent his strength to combat them for the di|version
<PB N="126" REF="024087_0134_0FC3042205D85680">
of the spectators in an amphithea|tre? and yet these were punishments a|mong the Romans in the politest ages of the empire. What greater cruelty is there in the American tortures, than in confining a man in a trough, and daubing him with honey that he may be stung to death by wasps and other venomous insects; or flea|ing him alive and stretching out his skin before his eyes, which modes of punish|ment were not inconsistent with the soft|ness and elegance of the ancient court of Persia? or, to come down to modern times; what greater misery can there be in the Indian executions, than in racking a pri|soner on a wheel, and breaking his bones one by one with an iron bar; or placing his legs in a boot and driving in wedges one after another; which tortures are still, or have till lately been used in some Euro|pean kingdoms? I forbear to name the torments of the inquisition, because they seem to be beyond the stretch of <HI>human</HI> in|vention. If civilized nations, and those who profess the most merciful religion that ever blessed the world, have practised these cruelties, what could be expected of men who were strangers to every degree of refinement either civil or mental?</P>
<P>The Indians have been represented as
<PB N="127" REF="024087_0135_0FC3042C21114178">
<HI>revengeful.</HI> When any person was killed, the nearest relative thought himself bound to be the avenger of blood, and never left seeking, till he found an opportunity to execute his purpose. Whether in a state, where government is confessedly so feeble as among them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Numbers ch. 35. v. 19. Deutero|nomy ch. 19. v. 12.</NOTE> such a conduct is not jus|tifiable, and even countenanced by the Jewish law may deserve our consideration&punc;</P>
<P>The <HI>treachery</HI> with which these people are justly charged, is exactly the same dis|position which operates in the breach of solemn treaties made between nations which call themselves christian. Can it be more criminal in an Indian, than in an European, not to think himself bound by promises and oaths extorted from him when under duress?</P>
<P>Their <HI>jealousy and hatred</HI> of their En|glish neighbours may easily be accounted for, if we allow them to have the same feelings with ourselves. How natural is it for us to form a disagreeable idea of a whole nation, from the bad conduct of some individuals with whom we are ac|quainted? and though others of them may be of a different character, yet will not that prudence which is esteemed a virtue, lead us to suspect the fairest appearances,

as used to cover the most fraudulent de|signs, especially if pains are taken by the most politic among us, to foment such jealousies to subserve their own ambitious purposes?</P>
<P>Though the greater part of the English settlers came hither with religious views, and fairly purchased their lands of the In|dians, yet it cannot be denied that some, especially in the eastern parts of New-England, had lucrative views only; and from the beginning used fraudulent me|thods in trade with them. Such things were indeed disallowed by the government, and would always have been punished if the Indians had made complaint: but they knew only the law of retaliation, and when an injury was received, it was never forgotten till revenged. Encroachments made on their lands, and fraud committed in trade, afforded sufficient grounds for a quarrel, though at ever so great a length of time; and kept alive a perpetual jea|lousy of the like treatment again<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mons. du Pratz gives nearly the same account of the Indians on the Mississippi.
<Q>There needs nothing but prudence and good sense to persuade these people to what is reasonable, and to pre|serve their friendship without interruption. We may safely affirm, that the differences we have had with them have been more ow|ing to the French than to them. When they are treated inso|lently, or oppressively, they have no less sensibility of injuries than others.</Q>

<P><PB N="129" REF="024087_0137_0FC3042FE7477F08">Such was the temper of the Indians of New-England when the first general war began.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1675.</NOTE> It was thought by the English in that day, that Philip, sachem of the Wom|panoags, a crafty and aspiring man, part|ly by intrigue, and partly by example, excit|ed them to such a general combination. He was the son of Massassoiet, the nearest sachem to the colony of Plymouth, with whom he had concluded a peace, which he maintained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> through fear than good will, as long as he lived. His son and immediate suc|cessor Alexander, preserved the same ex|ternal shew of friendship; but died with choler on being detected in a plot against them. Philip, it is said, dissembled his hostile puposes; he was ready, on every suspicion of his infidelity, to renew his submission, and testify it even by the de|livery of his arms, till he had secretly in|fused a cruel jealousy into many of the neighbouring Indians; which excited them to attempt the recovering their country by extirpating the new possessors. The plot, it is said, was discovered before it was ripe for execution; and as he could no longer promise himself security under the mask of friendship, he was constrained to shew him|self in his true character, and accordingly began hostilities upon the plantation of

Swanzy, in the colony of Plymouth, in the month of June 1675.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this general opinion, it may admit of some doubt, whether a single sachem, whose authority was limit|ed, could have such an extensive influence over tribes so remote and unconnected with him as the eastern Indians; much more improbable is it, that those in Virginia should have joined in the confederacy, as it hath been intimated.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's Narrative, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> The Indians ne|ver travelled to any greater distance than their hunting required; and so ignorant were they of the geography of their coun|try,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neal's Hist. N.E. Vol. 1. p. 21.</NOTE> that they imagined New-England to be an island, and could tell the name of an inlet or streight by which they sup|posed it was separated from the main land. But what renders it more improbable that Philip was so active an instrument in ex|citing this war, is the constant tradition among the posterity of those people who lived near him, and were familiarly con|versant with him, and with those of his Indians who survived the war: which is, that he was forced on by the fury of his young men, sorely against his own judg|ment and that of his chief counsellors; and that as he foresaw that the English would,
<PB N="131" REF="024087_0139_0FC3043B44F96C18">
in time, establish themselves and extirpate the Indians, so he thought that the mak|ing war upon them would only hasten the destruction of his own people. It was al|ways a very common, and sometimes a just excuse with the Indians, when charg|ed with breach of faith, that the old men were not able to restrain the younger from signalizing their valour, and gratifying their revenge, though they disapproved their rashness. This want of restraint was owing to the weakness of their govern|ment; their sachems having but the sha|dow of magistratical authority.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Bristol shew a parti|cular spot where Philip received the news of the first Englishmen that were killed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Callender's Century Sermon, p. 73.</NOTE> with so much sorrow as to cause him to weep; a few days before which he had rescued one who had been taken by his Indians, and privately sent him home. Whatever credit may be given to this ac|count, so different from the current opi|nion, it must be owned, that in such a sea|son of general confusion as the first war occasioned, fear and jealousy might create many suspicions, which would soon be formed into reports of a general confede|racy, through Philip's contrivance; and it is to be noted that the principal histories
<PB N="132" REF="024087_0140_0FC30442768B2280">
of this war, [Increase Mather's and Hub|bard's] were printed in 1676 and 1677, when the strangest reports were easily cre|dited, and the people were ready to be|lieve every thing that was bad of so formi|dable a neighbour as Philip. But as the fact cannot now be precisely ascertained, I shall detain the reader no longer from the real causes of the war in these eastern parts.</P>
<P>There dwelled near the river Saco a sa|chem named Squando, a noted enthusiast, a leader in the devotions of their religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard, p. 29.61.</NOTE> and one that pretended to a familiar inter|course with the invisible world. These qualifications rendered him a person of the highest dignity, importance and influ|ence among all the eastern Indians. His squaw passing along the river in a canoe, with her infant child, was met by some rude sailors, who having heard that the Indian children could swim as naturally as the young of the brutal kind, in a thought|less and unguarded humour overset the canoe. The child sunk, and the mother instantly diving fetched it up alive, but the child dying soon after, its death was imputed to the treatment it had received from the seamen; and Squando was so provoked that he conceived a bitter anti|pathy
<PB N="133" REF="024087_0141_0FC30446F4195F30" MS="y">
to the English, and employed his great art and influence to excite the Indi|ans against them. Some other injuries were alledged as the ground of the quarrel;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magnalia, Lib. 7. p. 55.</NOTE> and, considering the interested views and irregular lives of many of the eastern set|tlers, their distance from the seat of go|vernment, and the want of due subordi|nation among them, it is not improba|ble that a great part of the blame of the eastern war belonged to them.</P>
<P>The first alarm of the war in Plymouth colony spread great consternation among the distant Indians, and held them a while in suspence what part to act; for there had been a long external friendship subsisting between them and the English, and they were afraid of provoking so powerful neighbours. But the seeds of jealousy and hatred had been so effectually sown, that the crafty and revengeful, and those who were ambitious of doing some exploits, soon found means to urge them on to an open rupture; so that within twenty days after Philip had begun the war at the southward, the flame broke out in the most northeasterly part of the country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard, p. 13.</NOTE> at the distance of two hundred miles.</P>
<P>The English inhabitants about the river Kennebeck, hearing of the insurrection in
<PB N="134" REF="024087_0142_0FC30448AAD4BCA8">
Plymouth colony, determined to make trial of the fidelity of their Indian neigh|bours, by requesting them to deliver their arms. They made a shew of compliance; but, in doing it, committed an act of vio|lence on a Frenchman, who lived in an English family; which being judged an offence, both by the English and the elder Indians, the offender was seized; but up|on a promise, with security, for his future good behaviour, his life was spared, and some of them consented to remain as hos|tages; who soon made their escape, and joined with their fellows in robbing the house of Purchas, an ancient planter at Pechypscot.</P>
<P>The quarrel being thus begun, and their natural hatred of the English, and jealousy of their designs, having risen to a great height under the malignant influence of Squando and other leading men; and being encouraged by the ex|ample of the western Indians, who were daily making depredations on the colonies of Plymouth, and Massachusetts; they took every opportunity to rob and murder the people in the scattered settlements of the province of Maine; and having dis|persed themselves into many small parties, that they might be the more extensively

mischievous, in the month of September they approached the plantations at Pas|cataqua, and made their first onset at Oyster river then a part of the town of Dover, but now Durham. Here they burned two houses belonging to two persons named Chesly, killed two men in a canoe, and carried away two captives;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard, p. 19.</NOTE> both of whom soon after made their escape. About the same time a party of four laid in ambush near the road between Exeter and Hamp|ton, where they killed one, and took an|other, who made his escape. Within a few days an assault was made on the house of one Tozer at Newichwannock, where|in were fifteen women and children, all of whom, except two, were saved by the intre|pidity of a girl of eighteen. She first seeing the Indians as they advanced to the house, shut the door and stood against it, till the others escaped to the next house, which was better secured. The Indians chopped the door to pieces with their hatchets, and then entering, they knocked her down, and leaving her for dead, went in pursuit of the others, of whom two children, who could not get over the fence, fell into their hands. The adventurous heroine reco|vered, and was perfectly healed of her wound.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="024087_0144_0FC30453E7256C60">The two following days they made se|veral appearances on both sides of the ri|ver, using much insolence, and burning two houses and three barns, with a large quantity of grain. Some shot were ex|changed without effect, and a pursuit was made after them into the woods by eight men, but night obliged them to return without success. Five or six houses were burned at Oyster river, and two more men killed. These daily insults could not be borne without indignation and reprisal. About twenty young men, chiefly of Do|ver, obtained leave of Major Waldron, then commander of the militia, to try their skill and courage with the Indians in their own way.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard, p. 22.</NOTE> Having scattered themselves in the woods, a small party of them disco|vered five Indians in a field near a desert|ed house, some of whom were gathering corn, and others kindling a fire to roast it. The men were at such a distance from their fellows that they could make no signal to them without danger of a discovery; two of them, therefore, crept along silently, near to the house, from whence they sud|denly rushed upon those two Indians, who were busy at the fire, and knocked them down with the butts of their guns; the other three took the alarm and escaped.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="024087_0145_0FC30456E8D1F380">All the plantations at Pascataqua, with the whole eastern country, were now filled with fear and confusion: Business was suspended, and every man was obliged to provide for his own and his family's safe|ty. The only way was to desert their ha|bitations, and retire together within the larger and more convenient houses, which they fortified with a timber wall and flank-arts, placing a centry-box on the roof. Thus the labour of the field was exchang|ed for the duty of the garrison, and they who had long lived in peace and security were upon their guard night and day, sub|ject to continual alarms, and the most fear|ful apprehensions.</P>
<P>The seventh of October was observed as a day of fasting and prayer; and on the sixteenth the enemy made an assault upon the inhabitants at Salmon falls, in Berwick. Lieutenant Roger Plaisted, being a man of true courage and of a public spirit, imme|diately sent out a party of seven from his garrison to make discovery. They fell into an ambush; three were killed, and the rest retreated. The Lieutenant then dispatched an express to Major Waldron and Lieutenant Coffin at Cochecho, beg|ging most importunately for help, which they were in no capacity to afford, con|sistently
<PB N="138" REF="024087_0146_0FC3045AB5F0C2F8">
with their own safety. The next day Plaisted ventured out with twenty men, and a cart to fetch the dead bodies of their friends, and unhappily fell into another ambush. The cattle affrighted ran back, and Plaisted being deserted by his men, and disdaining either to yield or fly, was killed on the spot, with his eldest son and one more; his other son died of his wound in a few weeks. Had the heroism of this worthy family been imitated by the rest of the party, and a reinforcement arrived in season, the enemy might have received such a severe check as would have prevent|ed them from appearing in small parties. The gallant behaviour of Plaisted, though fatal to himself and his sons, had this good effect, that the enemy retreated to the woods; and the next day Captain Frost came up with a party from Sturgeon creek, and peaceably buried the dead:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 24.</NOTE> But be|fore the month had expired a mill was burned there, and an assault made on Frost's garrison, who though he had only three boys with him, kept up a constant fire, and called aloud as if he were commanding a body of men, to march here and fire there: the stratagem succeeded, and the house was saved. The enemy then proceeded down the river, killing and plundering as they
<PB N="139" REF="024087_0147_0FC3045C21ACA6B8">
found people off their guard, till they came opposite to Portsmouth; from whence some cannon being fired they dispersed, and were pursued by the help of a light snow which fell in the night, and were overtaken by the side of a swamp, into which they threw themselves, leaving their packs and plun|der to the pursuers. They soon after did more mischief at Dover, Lamprey river and Exeter; and with these small, but ir|ritating assaults and skirmishes, the autumn was spent until the end of November; when the number of people killed and taken from Kennebeck to Pascataqua a|mounted to upwards of fifty.</P>
<P>The Massachusetts government being fully employed in defending the southern and western parts, could not seasonably send succours to the eastward. Major General Denison, who commanded the mi|litia of the colony, had ordered the majors who commanded the regiments on this side of the country, to draw out a sufficient number of men to reduce the enemy, by attacking them at their retreat to their head-quarters at Ossapy and Pigwacket. But the winter setting in early and fiercely, and the men being unprovided with rack|ets to travel on the snow, which by the tenth of December was four feet deep in
<PB N="140" REF="024087_0148_0FC30466ECCD7F68">
the woods, it was impossible to execute the design. This peculiar severity of the sea|son however proved favourable. The In|dians were pinched with famine, and hav|ing lost by their own confession about ninety of their number, partly by the war, and partly for want of food, they were re|duced to the necessity of suing for peace. With this view they came to Major Wal|dron, expressing great sorrow for what had been done, and promising to be quiet and submissive. By his mediation a peace was concluded with the whole body of eastern Indians, which continued till the next Au|gust; and might have continued longer, if the inhabitants of the eastern parts had not been too intent on private gain, and of a disposition too ungovernable to be a barrier against an enemy so irritable and vindictive. The restoration of the captives made the peace more pleasant: A return from the dead could not be more welcome than a deliverance from Indian captivity.</P>
<P>The war at the southward, though re|newed in the spring,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1676.</NOTE> drew toward a close. Philip's affairs were desperate; many of his allies and dependents forsook him; and in the month of August he was slain by a party under Captain Church.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Church's Memoirs, p. 44.</NOTE> Those western Indians who had been engaged in
<PB N="141" REF="024087_0149_0FC30468E78F7CB8">
the war, now fearing a total extirpation, endeavoured to conceal themselves among their brethren of Penacook who had not joined in the war, and with those of Ossapy and Pigwacket who had made peace. But they could not so disguise themselves or their behaviour as to escape the discern|ment of those who had been conversant with Indians. Several of them were taken at different times and delivered up to pub|lic execution. Three of them, Simon, Andrew and Peter, who had been concern|ed in killing Thomas Kimbal of Bradford, and captivating his family, did, within six weeks voluntarily restore the woman and five children. It being doubted whether this act of submission was a sufficient atone|ment for the murder, they were commit|ted to Dover prison till their case could be considered. Fearing that this confinement was a prelude to farther punishment, they broke out of prison, and going to the east|ward, joined with the Indians of Kenne|beck and Amoriscogin in those depreda|tions which they renewed on the inhabi|tants of those parts, in August, and were afterward active in distressing the people at Pascataqua.</P>
<P>This renewal of hostilities occasioned the sending of two companies to the eastward
<PB N="142" REF="024087_0150_0FC3046FC2DE5448">
under Captain Joseph Syll, and Captain William Hawthorne. In the course of their march they came to Cochecho, on the sixth of September, where four hun|dred mixed Indians were met at the house of Major Waldron, with whom they had made the peace, and whom they consider|ed as their friend and father. The two captains would have fallen upon them at once, having it in their orders to seize all Indians, who had been concerned in the war. The major dissuaded them from that purpose, and contrived the following stra|tagem. He proposed to the Indians, to have a training the next day, and a sham fight after the English mode; and sum|moning his own men, with those under Captain Frost of Kittery, they, in conjunc|tion with the two companies, formed one party, and the Indians another. Having diverted them a while in this manner, and caused the Indians to fire the first volley; by a peculiar dexterity, the whole body of them (except two or three) were sur|rounded, before they could form a suspi|cion of what was intended. They were immediately seized and disarmed, without the loss of a man on either side. A sepa|ration was then made: Wonolanset, with the Penacook Indians, and others who
<PB N="143" REF="024087_0151_0FC3047124067920">
had joined in making peace the winter be|fore, were peaceably dismissed; but the strange Indians, (as they were called) who had fled from the southward and taken re|fuge among them, were made prisoners, to the number of two hundred; and being sent to Boston, seven or eight of them, who were known to have killed any Eng|lishmen, were condemned and hanged; the rest were sold into slavery in foreign parts.</P>
<P>This action was highly applauded by the general voice of the colony; as it gave them opportunity to deal with their ene|mies in a judicial way, as rebels, and, as they imagined, to extirpate those trouble|some neighbours. The remaining Indi|ans, however, looked upon the conduct of Major Waldron as a breach of faith; inas|much as they had taken those fugitive In|dians under their protection, and had made peace with him, which had been strictly observed with regard to him and his neighbours, though it had been broken elsewhere. The Indians had no idea of the same government being extended very far, and thought they might make peace in one place, and war in another, without any imputation of infidelity; but a breach of hospitality and friendship, as they deem|ed

this to be, merited, according to their principles, a severe revenge, and was never to be forgotten or forgiven. The major's situation on this occasion was indeed ex|tremely critical; and he could not have acted either way without blame. It is said that his own judgment was against any forcible measure, as he knew that many of those Indians were true friends to the colony; and that in case of failure he should expose the country to their re|sentment; but had he not assisted the forces in the execution of their commission, (which was to seize all Indians who had been con|cerned with Philip in the war) he must have fallen under censure, and been deemed accessary, by his neglect, to the mischiefs which might afterward have been perpe|trated by them. In this dilemma he finally determined to comply with the orders and expectations of government; imagining that he should be able to satisfy those of the Indians whom he intended to dismiss, and that the others would be removed out of the way of doing any further mis|chief; but he had no suspicion that he was laying a snare for his own life. It was unhappy for him, that he was obliged in deference to the laws of his country, and the orders of government, to give offence

to a people who, having no public judica|tories and penal laws among themselves, were unable to distinguish between a legal punishment and private malice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The above account of the seizure of the Indians is given from the most authentic and credible tradition that could be obtained within the last sixteen years, from the posterity of those persons who were concerned in the affair.

<P>Two days after this surprisal the forces proceeded on their route to the eastward, being joined with some of Waldron's and Frost's men; and taking with them Blind Will, a sagamore of the Indians who lived about Cochecho, and eight of his people for pilots. The eastern settlements were all either destroyed or deserted, and no enemy was to be seen; so that the expe|dition proved fruitless, and the companies returned to Pascataqua.</P>
<P>It was then thought adviseable, that they should march up toward the Ossapy ponds; where the Indians had a strong fort of timber fourteen feet high, with flankarts; which they had a few years before hired some English carpenters to build for them, as a defence against the Mohawks, of whom they were always afraid. It was thought that if the Indians could be surprized on their first return to their head-quarters, at
<PB N="146" REF="024087_0154_0FC30481018FDF30">
the beginning of winter, some considerable advantage might be gained against them; or if they had not arrived there, that the provisions, which they had laid in fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their winter subsistence, might be destr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed. Accordingly, the companies being well provided for a march at that season, set off on the first of November; and after tra|velling four days through a rugged, moun|tainous wilderness, and crossing several rivers, they arrived at the spot; but found the fort and adjacent places entirely de|serted, and saw not an Indian in all the way. Thinking it needless for the whole body to go further, the weather being se|vere, and the snow deep, a select party was detached eighteen or twenty miles above; who discovered nothing but frozen ponds, and snowy mountains; and supposing the Indians had taken up their winter quarters nearer the sea, they returned to Newich|wannock, within nine days from their first departure.</P>
<P>They had been prompted to undertake this expedition by the false accounts brought by Mogg, an Indian of Penobscot, who had come in to Pascataqua, with a proposal of peace; and had reported that an hundred Indians were assembled at Ossapy. This Indian brought with him two men of
<PB N="147" REF="024087_0155_0FC3048A5E5C9158">
Portsmouth, Fryer and Kendal, who had been taken on board a vessel at the east|ward; he was deputed by the Penobscot tribe to consent to articles of pacification; and being sent to Boston, a treaty was drawn and subscribed by the governor and magistrates on the one part, and by Mogg on the other; in which it was stipulated, that if the Indians of the other tribes did not agree to this transaction, and cease ho|stilities, they should be deemed and treat|ed as enemies by both parties. This treaty was signed on the sixth of November; Mogg pledging his life for the fulfilment of it. Accordingly, vessels being sent to Penobscot, the peace was ratified by Mado|kawando the sachem, and two captives were restored. But Mogg, being incau|tiously permitted to go to a neighbouring tribe, on pretence of persuading them to deliver their captives, though he promised to return in three days, was seen no more. It was at first thought that he had been sacrificed by his countrymen, as he pre|tended to fear when he left the vessels; but a captive who escaped in January gave a different account of him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1677.</NOTE> that he boast|ed of having deceived the English, and laughed at their kind entertainment of him. There was also a design talked of among
<PB N="148" REF="024087_0156_0FC3048C9B1C3F20">
them to break the peace in the spring, and join with the other Indians at the eastward in ruining the fishery. About the same time it was discovered that some of the Narrhaganset Indians were scattered in the eastern parts; three of them having been decoyed by some of the Cochecho Indians into their wigwams, and scalped, were known by the cut of their hair. This raised a fear in the minds of the people, that more of them might have found their way to the eastward, and would prosecute their revenge against them.</P>
<P>From these circumstances it was suspec|ted, that the truce would be but of short continuance. The treachery of Mogg, who was surety for the performance of the treaty, was deemed a full justification of the renewal of hostilities; and the state of things was, by some gentlemen of Pas|cataqua, represented to be so dangerous, that the government determined upon a winter expedition. Two hundred men, including sixty Natick Indians, were en|listed and equipped, and sailed from Boston the first week in February, under the com|mand of Major Waldron; a day of prayer having been previously appointed for the success of the enterprize.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="024087_0157_0FC30490EE2F6CE0">At Casco the major had a fruitless con|ference, and a slight skirmish with a few Indians, of whom some were killed and wounded. At Kennebeck he built a fort, and left a garrison of forty men, under the command of Captain Sylvanus Davis. At Pemaquid he had a conference with a com|pany of Indians, who promised to deliver their captives on the payment of a ransom: Part of it being paid, three captives were delivered, and it was agreed that the con|ference should be renewed in the after|noon, and all arms be laid aside. Some suspicion of their infidelity had arisen, and when the major went ashore in the after|noon with five men, and the remainder of the ransom, he discovered the point of a lance hid under a board, which he drew out and advanced with it toward them; charging them with treachery in conceal|ing their arms so near. They attempted to take it from him by force; but he threatened them with instant death, and waved his cap for a signal to the vessels. While the rest were coming on shore, the major with his five men secured the goods: Some of the Indians snatching up a bun|dle of guns which they had hid, ran away: Captain Frost, who was one of the five, seized an Indian, who was well known to
<PB N="150" REF="024087_0158_0FC3049225007538">
be a rogue, and with Lieutenant Nutter, carried him on board. The major search|ing about found three guns, with which he armed his remaining three men; and the rest being come on shore by this time, they pursued the Indians, killed several of them before they could recover their ca|noes, and after they had pushed off, sunk one with five men, who were drowned; and took four prisoners, with about a thou|sand pounds of dried beef, and some other plunder. The whole number of the In|dians was twenty-five.</P>
<P>Whether the casual discovery of their arms, which they had agreed to lay aside, was sufficient to justify this severity, may be doubted; since, if their intentions had really been hostile, they had a fine oppor|tunity of ambushing or seizing the major and his five attendants, who came ashore unarmed; and it is not likely that they would have waited for the rest to come ashore before they opened the plot. Possi|bly, this sudden suspicion might be ground|less, and might inflame the prejudice against the major, which had been already excited by the seizure of their friends at Cochecho some time before.</P>
<P>On the return of the forces, they found some wheat, guns, anchors and boards at

Kennebeck, which they took with them. They killed two Indians on Arrowsick Island, who, with one of the prisoners taken at Pemaquid, and shot on board, made the number of Indians killed in this expedition thirteen. They returned to Boston on the eleventh of March, with|out the loss of a man, bringing with them the bones of Captain Lake, which they found entire in the place where he was killed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here ends Hubbard's printed narrative.

<P>There being no prospect of peace at the eastward, it became necessary to maintain great circumspection and resolution, and to make use of every possible advantage against the enemy. A long and invete|rate animosity had subsisted between the Mohawks and the eastern Indians, the original of which is not mentioned, and perhaps was not known by any of our historians; nor can the oldest men among the Mohawks at this day give any account of it. These Indians were in a state of friendship with their English neighbours; and being a fierce and formidable race of men, their name carried terror wherever
<PB N="152" REF="024087_0160_0FC3049E0EE56290">
it was known. It was now thought, that if they could be induced to prosecute their ancient quarrel with the eastern Indians, the latter might be awed into peace, or incapacitated for any farther mischief. The propriety of this measure became a subject of debate; some questioning the lawfulness of making use of their help, "as they were heathen;" but it was urged in reply, that Abraham had entered into a confederacy with the Amorites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genesis, ch. 14.</NOTE> among whom he dwelled, and made use of their assistance in recovering his kinsman Lot from the hands of their common enemy. With this argument the objectors were satisfied; and the two messengers, Major Pynchon of Springfield, and Richards of Hartford were dispatched to the country of the Mohawks; who treated them with great civility, expressed the most bitter hatred against the eastern enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's MS Histo|ry.</NOTE> and promised to pursue the quarrel to the ut|most of their power.</P>
<P>Accordingly some parties of them came down the country about the middle of March, and the first alarm was given at Amuskeeg falls; where the son of Wono|lanset being hunting, discovered fifteen Indians on the other side, who called to him in a language which he did not un|derstand;
<PB N="153" REF="024087_0161_0FC3049F589A5ED0">
upon which he fled, while they fired near thirty guns at him without effect. Presently after this they were discovered in the woods about Cochecho. Major Waldron sent out eight of his Indians whereof Blind Will was one, for farther information. They were all surprized to|gether by a company of the Mohawks;<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Jour|nal, March 30.</NOTE> two or three escaped, the others were either killed or taken: Will was dragged away by his hair; and being wounded, perished in the woods, on a neck of land, formed by the confluence of Cochecho and Ising|glass rivers, which still bears the name of Blind Will's Neck. This fellow was judged to be a secret enemy to the English, though he pretended much friendship and respect; so that it was impossible to have punished him, without provoking the other neighbouring Indians, with whom he lived in amity, and of whose fidelity there was no suspicion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's MS Hist.</NOTE> It was at first thought a fortunate circumstance that he was killed in this manner; but the con|sequence proved it to be otherwise; for two of those who were taken with him escaping, reported that the Mohawks threatened destruction to all the Indians in these parts without distinction:<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Jour|nal.</NOTE> So that those who lived in subjection to the En|glish
<PB N="154" REF="024087_0162_0FC304A06D650090">
grew jealous of their sincerity, and ima|gined, not without very plausible ground, that the Mohawks had been persuaded or hired to engage in the war, on purpose to destroy them; since they never actually exercised their fury upon those Indians who were in hostility with the English, but only upon those who were in friend|ship with them; and this only in such a degree as to irritate, rather than to weak|en or distress them. It cannot therefore be thought strange that the friendly In|dians were alienated from their English neighbours, and disposed to listen to the seducing stratagems of the French; who in a few years after made use of them, in conjunction with others, sorely to scourge these unhappy people. The English, in reality, had no such design; but the event proved, that the scheme of engaging the Mohawks in our quarrel, however lawful in itself, and countenanced by the exam|ple of Abraham, was a pernicious source of innumerable calamities.</P>
<P>The terror which it was thought this incursion of the Mohawks would strike in|to the eastern Indians was too small to prevent their renewing hostilities very early in the spring. Some of the garrison who had been left at Kennebeck were surprized

<P>More mischief being expected, and the eastern settlements needing assistance, the government ordered two hundred Indians of Natick, with forty English soldiers, under Captain Benjamin Swett of Hamp|ton, and Lieutenant Richardson, to march to the falls of Taconick on Kennebeck river; where it was said the Indians had

Swett divided his men accordingly, and went to meet them. The enemy retreated till they had drawn our people two miles from the fort, and then turning suddenly and violently upon them, threw them into confusion, they being mostly young and unexperienced soldiers. Swett, with a few of the more resolute, fought bravely on the retreat, till he came near the fort, when he was killed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Letter of Mr. Gookin of Hampton.</NOTE> sixty more were left dead or wounded, and the rest got into the fort. The victorious sa|vages then surprized about twenty fishing vessels, which put into the eastern harbours by night; the crews, not being apprehen|sive of danger on the water, fell an easy prey to them.

<P><PB N="158" REF="024087_0166_0FC304AF6589AA38">At length, in the month of August, Major Androsse, governor of New-York, sent a sloop with some forces to take pos|session of the land which had been grant|ed to the Duke of York, and build a fort at Pemaquid, to defend the country against the encroachment of foreigners. Upon their arrival the Indians appeared friendly; and in evidence of their pacific disposition, restored fifteen prisoners with the fishing vessels.

<P>In the spring, Major Shapleigh of Kit|tery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1678.</NOTE> Captain Champernoon and Mr. Fryer of Portsmouth, were appointed commissi|oners to settle a formal treaty of peace with Squando and the other chiefs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Jour|nal, April 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> which was done at Casco, whither they brought the remainder of the captives.

<PB N="159" REF="024087_0167_0FC304B58BD2BFA8">
but not unjust, considering the former irregular conduct of many of the eastern settlers, and the native propriety of the Indians in the soil: Certainly they were now masters of it; and it was entire|ly at their option, whether the English should return to their habitations or not. It was therefore thought better to live peaceably, though in a sort of subjection, than to leave such commodious settlements and forego the advantages of trade and fishery, which were very considerable, and by which the inhabitants of that part of the country had chiefly subsisted.</P>
<P>It was a matter of great enquiry and speculation how the Indians were supplied with arms and ammunition to carry on this war.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's printed Narrative, p. 82.</NOTE> The Dutch at New-York were too near the Mohawks for the eastern In|dians to adventure thither. The French in Canada were too feeble, and too much in fear of the English, to do any thing which might disturb the tranquility; and there was peace between the two nations. It was therefore supposed that the Indians had long premeditated the war, and laid in a stock beforehand. There had for|merly been severe penalties exacted by the government, on the selling of arms and ammunition to the Indians; but ever
<PB N="160" REF="024087_0168_0FC304B6E3735140">
since 1657, licences had been granted to particular persons to supply them occasion|ally for the purpose of hunting, on pay|ing an acknowledgment to the public trea|sury. This indulgence, having been much abused by some of the eastern traders, who, far from the seat of government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ran|dolph's Narrative in Hutch. col. papers, p. 492.</NOTE> were im|patient of the restraint of law, was sup|posed to be the source of the mischief. But it was afterward discovered that the Baron de St. Castine, a reduced French of|ficer, who had married a daughter of Ma|dokawando, and kept a trading house at Penobscot, where he considered himself as independent, being out of the limits of any established government, was the person from whom they had their supplies; which needed not to be very great as they always husbanded their ammunition with much care, and never expended it but when they were certain of doing execution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid, p. 562.</NOTE></P>
<P>The whole burden and expence of this war, on the part of the colonies, were borne by themselves. It was indeed thought strange by their friends in England, and resented by those in power, that they made no ap|plication to the king for assistance. It was intimated to them by Lord Anglesey
<Q>that his majesty was ready to assist them with ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. Hist. vol. 1. p. 309.</NOTE> troops, ammunition or money, if
<PB N="161" REF="024087_0169_0FC304C129AC4DF0">
they would but ask it;</Q>
and their silence was construed to their disadvantage, as if they were proud, and obstinate, and de|sired to be considered as an independent state. They had indeed no inclination to ask favours from thence; being well aware of the consequence of laying themselves under obligations to those who had been seeking to undermine their establishment; and remembering how they had been ne|glected in the late Dutch wars, when they stood in much greater need of assistance: The king had then sent ammunition to New-York, but had sent word to New-England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch. col. pap. p. 506.</NOTE>
<Q>that they must shift for them|selves and make the best defence they could.</Q>
It was therefore highly injuri|ous to blame them for not making ap|plication for help. But if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ey had not been so ill treated, they coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot be charg|ed with disrespect, since they really did not need foreign assistance. Ships of war and regular troops must have been altogether useless; and no one that knew the nature of an Indian war could be serious in pro|posing to send them. Ammunition and money were necessary, but as they had long enjoyed a free trade, and had coined the bullion which they imported, there was no scarcity of money, nor of any stores
<PB N="162" REF="024087_0170_0FC304C2E044BE00">
which money could purchase. The me|thod of fighting with Indians could be learned only from themselves: After a little experience, few men in scattered parties were of more service than the largest and best equipped armies which Europe could have afforded. It ought ever to be remembered for the honor of New-Eng|land, that as their first settlement, so their preservation, increase, and defence, even in their weakest infancy were not owing to any foreign assistance, but under God, to their own magnanimity and perseve|rance.</P>
<P>Our gravest historians have recorded many omens, predictions, and other alarm|ing circumstances, during this and the Pe|quod war, which in a more philosophical and less credulous age would not be wor|thy of notice. When men's minds were rendered gloomy by the horrors of a sur|rounding wilderness, and the continual apprehension of danger from its savage in|habitants; when they were ignorant of the causes of many of the common ap|pearances in nature, and were disposed to resolve every unusual appearance into pro|digy and miracle, it is not to be wonder|ed that they should imagine they heard the noise of drums and guns in the air,
<PB N="163" REF="024087_0171_0FC304C97654B4E8">
and saw flaming swords and spears in the heavens, and should even interpret eclipses as ominous. Some old Indians had inti|mated their apprehensions concerning the increase of the English, and the diminu|tion of their own people, which any rati|onal observer in a course of forty or fifty years might easily have foretold, without the least pretence to a spirit of prophecy; yet these sayings were recollected, and re|corded, as so many predictions by force of a supernatural impulse on their minds, and many persons of the greatest distinction were disposed to credit them as such. These things would not have been men|tioned, but to give a just idea of the age: If mankind are now better enlightened, superstition is the less excuseable in its re|maining votaries.</P>

Copies of the com|plaints were inclosed; and Edward Ran|dolph, a kinsman of Mason, a man of great address and penetration, resolute and in|defatigable in business, was charged with the letters, and directed by the Lords of Trade to make enquiry into the state of the country.

<Q>he had found the whole country com|plaining of the usurpation of the magi|strates of Boston; earnestly hoping and expecting that his majesty would not permit them any longer to be oppressed; but would give them relief according to the promises of the commissioners in 1665.</Q>
With the same bitterness of temper, and in the same strain of misre|presentation, he inveighed against the go|vernment in a long report to the Lords of Trade; which farther inflamed the pre|judice that had long been conceived against the colony, and prepared the way for the separation which was meditated.</P>
<P>After his departure, a special council being summoned, at which the elders of the churches were present, the question was proposed to them
<Q>whether the best way of making answer to the complaints of Gorges and Mason about the extent of their patent, be by sending agents, or by writing only?</Q>
To which they answered,
<Q>That it was most expedient to send agents, to answer by way of in|formation, provided they were instruct|ed with much care and caution to nego|ciate the affair with safety to the coun|try, and loyalty to his majesty, in the preservation of their patent liberties.</Q>
<PB N="168" REF="024087_0176_0FC304E0F1F0AEE8">
Accordingly William Stoughton, after|ward lieutenant-governor, and Peter Bulk|ley then speaker of the house of deputies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. Hist. vol. 1. p. 311.</NOTE> were appointed agents and sailed for Eng|land.</P>
<P>At their arrival an hearing was ordered before the lords chief justices of the king's bench and common pleas;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1677.</NOTE> when the agents in the name of the colony disclaimed all title to the lands claimed by the petitioner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Narrative of Allen's Title, p. 5.</NOTE> and to the jurisdiction beyond three miles northward of the river Merrimack, to fol|low the course of the river, so far as it ex|tended. The judges reported to the king
<Q>that they could give no opinion as to the right of soil, in the provinces of New-Hampshire and Maine, not having the proper parties before them; it appearing that not the Massachusetts colony, but the ter-tenants had the right of soil, and whole benefit thereof, and yet were not summoned to defend their titles. As to Mason's right of government within the soil he claimed, their lordships, and in|deed his own counsel, agreed he had none; the great council of Plymouth, under whom he claimed, having no pow|er to transfer government to any. It was determined that the four towns of Portsmouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. col. 1. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">17.</NOTE> Dover, Exeter and Hamp|ton
<PB N="169" REF="024087_0177_0FC304E29CE677D0">
were out of the bounds of Massachu|setts.</Q>
This report was accepted and confirmed by the king in council.</P>
<P>After this, at the request of the agents, Sir William Jones the attorney general drew up a complete state of the case to be transmitted to the colony;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1679. Sept. 18.</NOTE> by which it seems that he had altered his opinion since the report which he gave to the king in 1675,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch. vol. 1. p. 317.</NOTE> concerning the validity of Mason's title. It was also admitted that the title could be tried only on the place, there be|ing no court in England that had cogni|zance of it.</P>
<P>It became necessary then to the establish|ment of Mason's title, that a new juris|diction should be erected, in which the king might direct the mode of trial and appeal at his pleasure: This being resolved upon, the colony of Massachusetts was in|formed, by a letter from the secretary of state,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 24.</NOTE> of the king's intention to separate New-Hampshire from their government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. col. pap. 522.</NOTE> and required to revoke all commissions which they had granted there, and which were hereby declared to be null and void. To prevent any extravagant demand, the king obliged the claimant to declare, un|der his hand and seal, that he would re|quire no rents of the inhabitants for the
<PB N="170" REF="024087_0178_0FC304ECC04993F0">
time passed, before the twenty fourth of June 1679, nor molest any in their pos|sessions for the time to come; but would make out titles to them and their heirs for|ever, provided they would pay him six-pence in the pound, according to the year|ly value of all houses which they had built and lands which they had improved.</P>
<P>Things being thus prepared, a commis|sion passed the great seal on the eighteenth of September for the government of New-Hampshire;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commissi|on.</NOTE> which
<Q>inhibits and restrains the jurisdiction exercised by the colony of Massachusetts over the towns of Ports|mouth, Dover, Exeter and Hampton, and all other lands extending from three miles to the northward of the river Mer|rimack and of any and every part there|of, to the province of Maine; constitutes a president and council to govern the pro|vince; appoints John Cutts, esq. president, to continue one year and till another be appointed by the same authority; Rich|ard Martyn, William Vaughan, and Thomas Daniel of Portsmouth, John Gilman of Exeter, Christopher Hussey of Hampton and Richard Waldron of Do|ver, esquires, to be of the council, who were authorised to choose three other qualified persons out of the several parts of the
<PB N="171" REF="024087_0179_0FC304EE2597EAA8">
province to be added to them. The said president and every succeeding one to ap|point a deputy to preside in his absence; the president or his deputy with any five to be a quorum. They were to meet at Portsmouth in twenty days after the ar|rival of the commission and publish it. They were constituted a court of record for the administration of justice, accord|ing to the laws of England, so far as cir|cumstances would permit; reserving a right of appeal to the king in council for actions of fifty pounds value. They were impowered to appoint military offi|cers, and take all needful measures for defence against enemies. Liberty of conscience was allowed to all protestants, those of the church of England to be particularly encouraged. For the support of government they were to continue the present taxes, till an assembly could be called; to which end they were with|in three months to issue writs under the province seal, for calling an assembly, to whom the president should recommend the passing such laws as should establish their allegiance, good order and defence, and the raising taxes in such manner and proportion as they should see fit. All laws to be approved by the president and

council, and then to remain in force till the king's pleasure should be known, for which purpose they should be sent to England by the first ships. In case of the president's death, his deputy to suc|ceed, and on the death of a counsellor, the remainder to elect another, and send over his name, with the names of two other meet persons, that the king might appoint one of the three. The king en|gaged for himself and successors to con|tinue the privilege of an assembly, in the same manner and form, unless by in|convenience arising therefrom he or his heirs should see cause to alter the same. If any of the inhabitants should refuse to agree with Mason or his agents, on the terms before mentioned, the president and council were directed to reconcile the difference, or send the case stated in writing with their own opinions, to the king, that he with his privy council might determine it according to equity.</Q></P>
<P>The form of government described in this commission considered abstractedly from the immediate intentions, characters, and connexions of the persons concerned, appears to be of as simple a kind as the nature of a subordinate government and the liberty of the subject can admit. The
<PB N="173" REF="024087_0181_0FC304F10AC8B248">
people, who are the natural and original source of power, had a representation in a body chosen by themselves; and the king was represented by a president and coun|cil of his own appointment, each had the right of instructing their representative, and the king had the superior prerogative of disannulling the acts of the whole at his pleasure. The principal blemish in the commission was the right claimed by the king of discontinuing the representation of the people, whenever he should find it inconvenient, after he had solemnly en|gaged to continue this privilege. The clause, indeed, is artfully worded, and might be construed to imply more or less at pleasure. Herein Charles was consist|ent with himself, parliaments being his aversion. However, there was in this plan as much of the spirit of the British constitution as there could be any founda|tion for in such a colony; for here was no third branch to form a balance between the king or his representative, and the peo|ple. The institution of an house of peers in Britain was the result of the feudal sys|tem: the barons being lords of the soil and enjoying a sovereignty within their own territories and over their own vassals; the constitution was formed by the union
<PB N="174" REF="024087_0182_0FC304FA5FECCE48">
of these distinct estates under one common sovereign. But there was nothing similar to this in New-England. The settlements began here by an equal division of pro|perty among independent freemen. Lord|ship and vassalage were held in abhorrence. The yeomanry were the proprietors of the soil and the natural defenders of their own rights and property; and they knew no superior but the king. A council, whether appointed by him or chosen by the people could not form a distinct body, because they could not be independent. Had such a simple form of colony government been more generally adopted, and persevering|ly adhered to, and administered only by the most delicate hands, it might have served better than any other, to perpetuate the dependence of the colonies on the Bri|tish crown.</P>

was not from any respect to them or favour to the people; but merely to obtain a more easy introduction to a new form of government, for a particular purpose, which they knew would be a source of perplexity and distress. They would gladly have declined acting in their new capacity; but considering the temper of the government in England, the una|voidable necessity of submitting to the change, and the danger (upon their refusal) of others being appointed who would be inimical to the country, they agreed to qualify themselves, determining to do what good, and keep off what harm they were able.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Rec.</NOTE> They therefore published the commission, and took the oaths on the twenty second day of January, which was beyond the utmost time limited in the commission.

Idolatry, blasphemy, treason, re|bellion, wilful murder, manslaughter, poisoning, witchcraft, sodomy, bestiality, perjury, man-stealing, cursing and rebel|ling against parents, rape and arson were made capital crimes. The other penal laws were in their main principles the same which are now in force. To prevent conten|tions that might arise by reason of the late change of government, all townships and grants of land were confirmed, and ordered to remain as before; and contro|versies about the titles of land were to be determined by juries chosen by the several towns, according to former custom. The president and council with the assembly were a supreme court of judicature, with a jury when desired by the parties; and three inferior courts were constituted at Dover, Hampton and Portsmouth. The military arrangement was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Law.</NOTE> one foot com|pany in each town, one company of artil|lery at the fort, and one troop of horse, all under the command of Major Waldron. During this administration, things went on as nearly as possible in the old channel,
<PB N="180" REF="024087_0188_0FC305125EE9C1E0">
and with the same spirit, as before the se|paration. A jealous watch was kept over their rights and privileges, and every en|croachment upon them was withstood to the utmost. The duties and restrictions established by the acts of trade and navi|gation were universally disgustful, and the more so as Randolph was appointed col|lector, surveyor and searcher of the customs throughout New-England. In the exe|cution of his commission he seized a ketch belonging to Portsmouth, but bound from Maryland to Ireland, which had put into this port for a few days. The master Mark Hunking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 23.</NOTE> brought an action against him at a special court before the president and council, and recovered damages and costs to the amount of thirteen pounds. Randolph behaved on this occasion with such insolence, that the council obliged him publickly to acknowledge his offence and ask their pardon.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Records and Files.</NOTE> He appealed from their judgment to the king; but what the issue was doth not appear. Having con|stituted Captain Walter Barefoote his dep|uty at this port, an advertisement was published requiring that all vessels should be entered and cleared with him. Upon which Barefoote was brought to examina|tion, and afterward indicted before the
<PB N="181" REF="024087_0189_0FC305174B326CB0">
president and council, for,
<Q>having in an high and presumptuous manner set up his majesty's office of customs without leave from the president and council;<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 25.</NOTE> in contempt of his majesty's authority in this place; for disturbing and obstruct|ing his majesty's subjects in passing from harbour to harbour, and town to town; and for his insolence in making no other answer to any question propounded to him but "my name is Walter."</Q>
He was sentenced to pay a fine of ten pounds, and stand committed till it was paid. But though Randolph's authority was denied, yet they made an order of their own for the observation of the acts of trade, and appointed officers of their own to see them executed. They had been long under the Massachusetts government, and learned their political principles from them; and as they had been used to think that all royal authority flowed in the channel of the charter, so they now thought that no authority derived from the crown could be regularly exercised in the province but through their commission. In this they reasoned agreeably not only to their former principles, but to their fundamental law, to which they steadily adhered, though they had no reason to think it would be
<PB N="182" REF="024087_0190_0FC3051BAFED1E88">
allowed by the crown; and though they knew that a rigid adherence to rights, however clear and sacred, was not the way to recommend themselves to royal favour. But they were not singular in these senti|ments, nor in their opposition to the laws of trade. Randolph was equally hated, and his commission neglected at Boston; where the notary refused to enter his protest against the proceedings of the court;<NOTE PLACE="marg">MSS in files.</NOTE> and he was obliged to post it on the exchange.</P>
<P>In the latter end of the year Mason ar|rived from England with a mandamus, re|quiring the council to admit him to a seat at the board,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 30.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1681.</NOTE> which was accordingly done. He soon entered on the business he came abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; endeavouring to persuade some of the people to take leases of him, threaten|ing others if they did not, forbidding them to cut fire-wood and timber, asserting his right to the province and assuming the title of lord-proprietor. His agents, or stew|ards as they were called, had rendered themselves obnoxious by demanding rents of several persons and threatening to sell their houses for payment. These proceed|ings raised a general uneasiness; and pe|titions were sent from each town, as well as from divers individuals, to the council
<PB N="183" REF="024087_0191_0FC3051CF04930D8">
for protection; who, taking up the matter judicially, published an order, prohibiting Mason or his agents at their peril to re|peat such irregular proceedings, and de|claring their intention to transmit the grievances and complaints of the people to the king. Upon this, Mason would no longer sit in council, though desired, nor appear when sent for; when they threat|ened to deal with him as an offender, he threatened to appeal to the king, and pub|lished a summons to the president and se|veral members of the council, and others to appear before his majesty in three months. This was deemed
<Q>an usurpa|tion over his majesty's authority here established,</Q>
and a warrant was issued for apprehending him; but he got out of their reach and went to England.</P>
<P>During these transactions President Cutts died,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 27. April 5.</NOTE> and Major Waldron succeed|ed him, appointing Captain Stileman for his deputy, who had quitted his place of secretary upon the appointment of Rich|ard Chamberlayne to that office by royal commission.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 30. 1680.</NOTE> The vacancy made in the council by the president's death was filled by Richard Waldron, junior.

Henry Dow was appointed marshal in the room of Roberts who resigned.</P>
<P>During the remainder of the council's administration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1682.</NOTE> the common business went on in the usual manner, and nothing re|markable is mentioned, excepting another prosecution of Barefoote, with his assistants, William Haskins and Thomas Thurton for seizing a vessel
<Q>under pretence of his majesty's name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 10.</NOTE> without the know|ledge of the authority of the province, and without showing any breach of statute though demanded.</Q>
Barefoote pleaded his deputation from Randolph; but he was amerced twenty pounds to be respited during his good behaviour, and his two assistants five pounds each; the complainant being left to the law for his damages. This affair was carried by appeal to the king: but the issue is not mentioned.</P>

<P>By the commission, which bears date the ninth of May, the governor was im|powered to call, adjourn, prorogue and dissolve general courts; to have a nega|tive voice in all acts of government; to suspend any of the council when he should see just cause (and every counsellor so sus|pended was declared incapable of being elected into the general assembly;) to ap|point a deputy-governor, judges, justices, and other officers, by his sole authority; and to execute the powers of vice-admiral. The case of Mason was recited nearly in the same words as in the former commis|sion, and the same directions were given to the governor to reconcile differences, or send cases fairly stated to the king in council, for his decision. The councellors named in this commission were Mason, who is styled proprietor, Waldron, Daniel,
<PB N="190" REF="024087_0198_0FC2FE9BDD780970">
Vaughan, Martyn, Gilman, Stileman and Clements: These were of the former council, and to them were added Walter Barefoote and Richard Chamberlayne.</P>
<P>Cranfield arrived and published his com|mission on the fourth of October,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Records.</NOTE> and within six days Waldron and Martyn were suspended from the council, on certain ar|ticles exhibited against them by Mason. This early specimen of the exercise of power must have been intended as a pub|lic affront to them, in revenge for their former spirited conduct; otherwise their names might have been left out of the commission when it was drawn.</P>
<P>The people now plainly saw the dan|gerous designs formed against them. The negative voice of a governor, his right of suspending counsellors, and appointing officers by his own authority, were wholly unprecedented in New-England; and they had the singular mortification to see the crown not only appointing two branches of their legislature, but claiming a nega|tive on the election of their representatives, in a particular case, which might some|times be essentially necessary to their own security. They well knew that the sole design of these novel and extraordinary powers was to facilitate the entry of the
<PB N="191" REF="024087_0199_0FC2FE9CF4B2EFB0">
claimant on the lands which some of them held by virtue of grants from the same authority, and which had all been fairly purchased of the Indians; a right which they believed to be of more validity than any other. Having by their own labour and expense subdued a rough wilderness, defended their families and estates against the savage enemy, without the least assist|ance from the claimant, and held pos|session for above fifty years; they now thought it hard and cruel, that when they had just recovered from the horrors of a bloody war, they should have their liberty abridged, and their property demanded, to satisfy a claim which was at best disputable and in their opinion groundless. On the other hand it was deemed unjust, that grants made under the royal authority should be disregarded; and that so great a sum as had been expended by the ances|tor of the claimant, to promote the settle|ment of the country, should be entirely lost to him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mason's Will.</NOTE> especially as he had foregone some just claims on the estate as a condi|tion of inheritance. Had the inhabitants by any fraudulent means impeded the de|signs of the original grantee, or embezzled his interest, there might have been a just demand for damages; but the unsuccess|fulness

of that adventure was to be sought for in its own impracticability; or the negligence, inability or inexperience of those into whose hands the management of it fell after Captain Mason's death, and during the minority of his successor.</P>
<P>An assembly, being summoned, met on the fourteenth of November; with whose concurrence a new body of laws was enacted, in some respects different from the former; the fundamental law being omitted and an alteration made in the appointment of jurors, which was now ordered to be done by the sheriff,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Laws.</NOTE> after the custom in England.</P>

<P>This appearance of good humour was but short-lived;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1683.

<P>The dissolution of the Assembly, a thing before unknown, aggravated the popular discontent, and kindled the resentment of some rash persons in Hampton and Exe|ter; who, headed by Edward Gove, a member of the dissolved assembly, declar|ed by sound of trumpet for "liberty and "reformation." There had been a town meeting at Hampton, when a new clerk was chosen and their records secured. Gove went from town to town proclaiming what had been done at Hampton, carrying his
<PB N="194" REF="024087_0202_0FC2FEA7CA0B7110">
arms, declaring that the governor was a traitor and had exceeded his commission, and that he would not lay down his arms till matters were set right, and endeavour|ing to excite the principal men in the prov|ince to join in a confederacy to overturn the government. His project appeared to them so wild and dangerous, that they not only disapproved it, but informed a|gainst him and assisted in apprehending him. Hearing of their design he collect|ed his company, and appeared in arms; but on the persuasion of some of his friends he surrendered. A special court was im|mediately commissioned for his trial, of which Major Waldron sat as judge, with William Vaughan and Thomas Daniel assistants. The grand jury presented a bill in which Edward Gove, John Gove, his son, and William Hely, of Hampton; Joseph, John and Robert Wadleigh, three brothers, Thomas Rawlins, Mark Baker and John Sleeper, of Exeter, were charg|ed with high-treason. Gove, who behav|ed with great insolence before the court, and pretended to justify what he had done, was convicted and received sentence of death in the usual hideous form;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 2.</NOTE> and his estate was seized, as forfeited to the crown.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pecial Courts.</NOTE> The others were convicted of being ac|complices,
<PB N="195" REF="024087_0203_0FC2FEA8E24DFB80">
and respited. The king's pleasure being signified to the governor that he should pardon such as he judged objects of mercy; they were all set at lib|erty but Gove, who was sent to England, and imprisoned in the tower of London about three years. On his repeated peti|tions to the king, and by the interest of Randolph with the Earl of Clarendon, then lord chamberlain, he obtained his pardon and returned home in 1686, with an order to the then president and council of New-England to restore his estate.</P>
<P>Gove in his petitions to the king plead|ed "a distemper of mind" as the cause of those actions for which he was prosecuted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gove's Papers.</NOTE> He also speaks in some of his private let|ters of a drinking match at his house, and that he had not slept for twelve days and nights, about that time. When these things are considered, it is not hard to ac|count for his conduct. From a letter which he wrote to the court whilst in pris|on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS in files.</NOTE> one would suppose him to have been disordered in his mind. His punishment was by much too severe, and his trial was hurried on too fast, it being only six days after the commission of his crime. Had he been indicted only for a riot there would have been no difficulty in the proof, nor
<PB N="196" REF="024087_0204_0FC2FEAA93953AB8">
hardship in inflicting the legal penalty. Waldron, it is said, shed tears when pro|nouncing the sentence of death upon him.</P>
<P>On the fourteenth of February the gov|ernor, by advertisement, called upon the inhabitants to take out leases from Mason within one month, otherwise he must, pursuant to his instructions, certify the re|fusal to the king, that Mason might be discharged of his obligation to grant them. Upon this summons and within the time set, Major Waldron, John Wingett and Thomas Roberts, three of the principal landholders in Dover, waited on the gov|ernor to know his pleasure, who directed them to agree with Mason. They then retired into another room where Mason was, and proposed to refer the matter to the governor, that he might according to his commission, state the matter to the king for his decision. This proposal Ma|son rejected, saying that unless they would own his title, he would have nothing to do with them. Whilst they were in dis|course the governor came in and desired them to depart.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weare's MS.</NOTE></P>
<P>This piece of conduct is difficult to be accounted for, it being directly in the face of the commission. Had the method there|in prescribed, and by these men proposed,
<PB N="197" REF="024087_0205_0FC2FEB3E9B5D758">
been adopted, it was natural to expect that the king, who had all along favoured Mason's pretensions, would have deter|mined the case as much to his wish as upon an appeal from a judicial court; besides, he had now the fairest opportunity to have it decided in the shortest way, to which his antagonists must have submitted, it being their own proposal. His refusal to accede to it was a capital mistake, as it left both him and Cranfield exposed to the charge of disobedience. But it afforded a powerful plea in behalf of the people; whose confidence in the royal justice would have induced them to comply with the di|rections in the commission. It being now impossible to have the controversy thus decided they determined to hearken to none of his proposals. As he generally met with opposition and contradiction he was induced to utter many rash sayings in all companies. He threatened to seize the principal estates, beggar their owners, and provoke them to rebellion by bring|ing a frigate into the harbour and procur|ing soldiers to be quartered on the inhabi|tants.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weare's MS.</NOTE> These threats were so far from in|timidating the people that they served the more firmly to unite them in their de|termination not to submit; and each par|ty
<PB N="198" REF="024087_0206_0FC2FEC058A68FE8">
was now warm in their opposition and resentment.</P>
<P>The governor on some fresh pretence suspended Waldron, Martyn and Gilman from the council. The deaths of Daniels and Clements made two other vacancies. Vaughan held his seat the longest, but was at length thrust out for his non-com|pliance with some arbitrary measures. So that the governor had it in his power to mo|del the council to his mind, which he did by appointing at various times Nathanael Fry|er, Robert Eliot, John Hinckes, James Sherlock, Francis Champernoon and Ed|ward Randolph, esquires. The judicial courts were also filled with officers proper for the intended business. Barefoote, the deputy governor, was judge; Mason was chancellor; Chamberlayne was clerk and prothonotary; Randolph was attorney-ge|neral,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Records.</NOTE> and Sherlock provost marshal and sheriff. Some who had always been disaf|fected to the country, and others who had been awed by threats or flattered by promises took leases from Mason; and these served for under sheriffs, jurors, evidences and other necessary persons.</P>
<P>Things being thus prepared, Mason be|gan his law-suits by a writ against Major Waldron, (who had always distinguished
<PB N="199" REF="024087_0207_0FC2FEC485434E28">
himself in opposition to his claim) for holding lands and felling timber to the amount of four thousand pounds. The major appeared in court, and challenged every one of the jury as interested per|sons, some of them having taken leases of Mason, and all of them living upon the lands which he claimed. The judge then caused the oath of <HI>voire dire</HI> to be admini|stered to each juror, purporting
<Q>that he was not concerned in the lands in ques|tion, and that he should neither gain nor lose by the cause.</Q>
Upon which the major said aloud to the people present.
<Q>That his was a leading case, and that if he were cast they must all become te|nants to Mason; and that all persons in the province being interested, none of them could legally be of the jury.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS in the files.</NOTE></Q>
The cause however went on; but he made no defence, asserted no title, and gave no evi|dence on his part. Judgment was given against him and at the next court of sessi|ons he was fined five pounds for "muti|nous and seditious words."</P>
<P>Suits were then instituted against all the principal landholders in the province, who, following Waldron's example, never made any defence. Some, chiefly of Hampton, gave in writing their reasons for not join|ing
<PB N="200" REF="024087_0208_0FC2FEC5FA4436C8">
issue; which were, the refusal of Ma|son to comply with the directions in the commission; the impropriety of a jury's determining what the king had expressly reserved to himself; and the incompetency of the jury, they being all interested per|sons, one of whom had said that
<Q>he would spend his estate to make Mason's right good.</Q>
These reasons were irri|tating rather than convincing to the court. The jury never hesitated in their verdicts. From seven to twelve causes were dispatch|ed in a day, and the costs were multiplied from five to twenty pounds. Executions were issued, of which two or three only were levied; but Mason could neither keep possession of the premises nor dispose of them by sale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MSS in files, and Weare's MSS.</NOTE> so that the owners still enjoy|ed them. Several threatened to appeal to the king but Major Vaughan alone made the experiment.</P>
<P>A suit was also commenced against Martyn who had been treasurer, for the fines and forfeitures received by him, during the former administration; and judgment was recovered for seventy one pounds with costs. Martyn petitioned Mason as chancellor, setting forth, that he had received and disposed of the mon|ey according to the orders of the late pre|sident and council, and praying that the
<PB N="201" REF="024087_0209_0FC2FEC7C827B138">
whole burden might not lie upon him. A decree was then issued for the other surviving members of the late council, and the heirs of those who were dead, to bear their proportion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MSS in files.</NOTE> This decree was afterward reversed by the king in council.</P>
<P>Cranfield with his council had now as|sumed the whole legislative power. They prohibited vessels from Massachusetts to enter the port, because the acts of trade were not observed in that colony: They fixed the dimensions of merchantable lum|ber; altered the value of silver money, which had always passed by weight at six shillings and eight-pence per ounce: and ordered that dollars should be receiv|ed at six shillings each, which was then a great hardship; as many of them were greatly deficient in weight: They also changed the bounds of townships; esta|blished fees of office&punc; made regulations for the package of fish, and ordered the constables to forbear collecting any town or parish taxes till the province tax was paid, and the accounts settled with the treasurer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Rec.</NOTE></P>
<P>The public grievances having become insupportable, the people were driven to the necessity of making a vigorous stand for their liberties. The only regular way
<PB N="202" REF="024087_0210_0FC2FED163C02D08">
was by complaint to the king. Having privately communicated their sentiments to each other, and raised money by sub|scription, they appointed Nathaniel Weare, esq. of Hampton their agent; and the four towns having drawn and subscribed distinct petitions of the same tenor, Weare pri|vately withdrew to Boston from whence he sailed for England. Major Vaughan who accompanied him to Boston, and was appointed to procure depositions to send after him, was upon his return to Ports|mouth, brought to an examination, treated with great insolence and required to find sureties for his good behaviour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">MSS in Files.</NOTE> which, having broken no law, he refused<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this refusal he is countenanced by the example of the great Selden, and other members of parliament who were imprisoned by order of Charles I. in 1629.

<P>Amidst these multiplied oppressions, Cranfield was still disappointed of the gains he had expected to reap from his office;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1684.</NOTE> and found to his great mortification, that there was no way of supplying his wants, but by application to the people, through

an assembly. He had already abused them so much that he could hope nothing from their favour; and was therefore obliged to have recourse to artifice. On a vague rumour of a foreign war, he pretended much concern for the preservation of the province from invasion; and presuming that they would show the same concern for themselves, he called an assembly at Great-Island where he resided, to whom he tendered a bill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">January 14.</NOTE> which in a manner to|tally unparliamentary, had been drawn and passed by the council, for raising mo|ney to defray the expence of repairing the fort, and supplying it with ammunition, and for <HI>other</HI> necessary charges of govern|ment.

In the morning they returned the bill with their negative; at which the governor was highly enraged, and telling them that they had been to consult with Moody, and other declared enemies of the king

Thus by a mean and execrable revenge, he taxed those whom he could not per|suade to tax their constituents for his pur|poses.</P>
<P>But Moody was marked as an object of peculiar vengeance. He had for some time rendered himself obnoxious by the freedom and plainness of his pulpit dis|courses, and his strictness in administering the discipline of the church; one instance of which merits particular notice. Ran|dolph having seized a vessel, she was in the night carried out of the harbour. The owner, who was a member of the church, swore that he knew nothing of it; but upon trial there appeared strong suspicions that he had perjured himself. He found means to make up the matter with the governor and collector; but Moody, be|ing concerned for the purity of his church, requested of the governor copies of the evidence, that the offender might be called to account in the way of ecclesiastical dis|cipline. Cranfield sternly refused, saying
<PB N="205" REF="024087_0213_0FC2FEDF8E816CB8">
that he had forgiven him, and that neither the church nor minister should meddle with him; and even threatened Moody in case he should. Not intimidated, Moody consulted the church and preached a ser|mon against false swearing; then the offender,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ports. Chh Records.</NOTE> being called to account was cen|sured, and at length brought to a public confession. This procedure extremely dis|gusted the governor who had no way then in his power to shew his resentment. But malice, ever fruitful in expedients to at|tain its ends, suggested a method, which to the scandal of the English nation, has been too often practised. The penal laws against nonconformists were at this time executing with great rigour in England; and Cranfield, ambitious to ape his royal master, determined to play off the ecclesi|astical artillery here, the direction of which he supposed to be deputed to him with his other powers. He had attempt|ed to impose upon the people the obser|vation of the thirtieth of January as a fast, and to restrain them from manual la|bour at Christmas; but his capital stroke was to issue an order in council
<Q>that af|ter the first of January, the ministers should admit all persons of suitable years and not vicious, to the Lord's supper,
<PB N="206" REF="024087_0214_0FC2FEE6A5F8FA50">
and their children to baptism; and that if any person should desire baptism or the other sacrament to be administered according to the liturgy of the church of England, it should be done, in pur|suance of the king's command to the colony of Massachusetts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This command was conceived in the following terms:</P>
<P><Q>And since the <HI>principle</HI> and foundation of that charter was and is freedom and <HI>liberty of conscience;</HI> Wee do hereby charge and require you that freedom and liberty be duely admitted and allow|ed, so that they that <HI>desire</HI> to use the booke of common prayer and perform their devotion in that manner that is established here be <HI>not denyed</HI> the exercise thereof, or undergoe any prejudice or disad|vantage thereby,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King Charles's Letter in Hutchin. col. pap. p. 378.</NOTE> <HI>they using their liberty peaceably without any disturb|ance to others;</HI> and that all persons of good and honest lives and conversations be admitted to the sacrament of the Lord's supper according to said booke of common prayer, and their children to baptisme.</Q></P>
<P>This command cannot consistently with the acknowledged <HI>principle</HI> and strict <HI>limitation,</HI> be construed any other way, than that the use of the liturgy should be permitted to such ministers and people as <HI>desired</HI> it.

<P>The same week in which he dissolved the assembly, he signified to Moody in writing, by the hands of the sheriff, that himself, with Mason and Hinckes, intend|ed to partake of the Lord's supper the next Sunday; requiring him to adminis|ter it to them according to the liturgy; and, as they justly expected, he at once denied them.

Joseph Rayn, by the governor's order exhibited an information at the next court of sessions, before Walter Barefoote judge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 5.</NOTE> Nathanael Fryer and Henry Greene assist|ants, Peter Coffin, Thomas Edgerly and Henry Robie justices, setting forth,
<Q>that Joshua Moody clerk, being minister of the town of Portsmouth within the do|minions of King Charles, was by the duty of his place and the laws of the realm, viz. the statutes of the fifth and sixth of Edward VI, the first of Eliza|beth, and the thirteenth and fourteenth of Charles II, required to administer the Lord's supper in such form as was set forth in the book of common prayer, and no other.

The other two persisted in their former opinion, and were soon after removed from all their offices. Moody was immediately ordered into custody, without being permitted first to see his fa|mily; and he remained under confinement, in company with Major Vaughan, at the house of Captain Stileman, with liberty of the yard, for thirteen weeks; "his bene|fice" being declared forfeited to the crown. The next week after Moody's trial, the governor in a profane bravado sent word to Seaborn Cotton minister of Hampton, that

Upon which Cotton

withdrew to Boston. The minister of Dover, John Pike, was (as far as I can find) unmolested. Exeter had then no settled minister.</P>
<P>During Moody's imprisonment, Cran|field would neither suffer him to go up to the town to preach, nor the people to as|semble at the island to hear, nor the neigh|bouring ministers to supply his place; on|ly the family where he was confined were permitted to be present with him at sab|bath exercises.

At length, by the interposition of friends, Moody obtained a release, though under a strict charge to preach no more within the province, on penalty of farther imprisonment. He then accepted an invitation from the first church in Boston; where being out of the reach of his persecutors, he was employed as a preacher, and was so highly esteemed that upon the death of President Rogers he was invited to take the oversight of the college, which he modestly declined,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Harvard College Records.</NOTE> and continued his ministrations at Boston, fre|quently

<P>Upon a calm review of this prosecution, one can hardly tell which is most detesta|ble, the vindictive temper which gave it birth; or the profaneness and hypocrisy with which it was conducted. The pre|tended zeal of the prosecutors was totally inconsistent with a due regard to those laws, and the principles of that church, for which they made themselves such con|temptible champions. For it had been long before this time, a received opinion in the church of England, that the vali|dity of all the sacramental administrations depends on authority derived from the apostles, by <HI>episcopal</HI> ordination, in an uninterrupted succession; and one of the statutes on which the prosecution was
<PB N="211" REF="024087_0219_0FC2FEF4734B6C88">
grounded enacts,
<Q>that no person shall presume to consecrate and administer the Lord's supper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stat 13 &amp; 14 Car. II.</NOTE> before he be ordained a priest by episcopal ordination, on pain of forfeiting for every offence one hun|dred pounds.</Q>
The ministers then in the province, being destitute of the grand pre-requisite, were in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">apable by the act, of doing what was so peremptorily requir|ed of them; and had they complied with the governor's order, must have exposed themselves to the penalty, if he had pleas|ed to exact it from them. But the extend|ing these penalties to the king's Ameri|can subjects, who had fled hither from the rod of prelatic tyranny, was a most unwarrantable stretch of power; since the last of these acts, and the only one which had been made since the settlement of the colonies, was expressly restricted in its ope|ration, to
<Q>the realm of England, domi|nion of Wales, and town of Berwick upon Tweed.</Q></P>
<P>Disappointed in all his schemes for rais|ing money by an assembly, Cranfield next ventured on the project of taxing the peo|ple without their consent. The pretext for this was a clause in the commission, impowering him, with the council,
<Q>to continue such taxes as had been former|ly
<PB N="212" REF="024087_0220_0FC2FEF623C44000">
levied, until a general assembly could be called.</Q>
This had been done, with|out offence, at the beginning both of this and the former administration, when the change of government rendered it neces|sary. But the council, though too much devoted to him, were not easily persuad|ed into the measure at this time; till fear at length accomplished what reason could not approve; for, letters being received from the eastward, informing of the dis|covery of a plot among the Indians, who were instigated by Castine the Frenchman to renew the war early in the spring,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eb. 14.</NOTE> the council were summoned in haste, and pre|sently agreed to the governor's proposal, for continuing such taxes as had been for|merly laid, which he told them was nec|essary for the immediate defence and se|curity of the province. This affair how|ever, was kept secret for the present; and the people were first to be convinced of the governor's paternal care and kindness in taking the necessary precautions for their safety.<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 13.</NOTE> It was ordered that the meeting-houses in each town should be fortified, and bye garrisons were established in con|venient places: Supplies of ammunitton were ordered to be provided: Circular letters were dispatched to the governors

of the neighbouring colonies, informing them of the danger: and, to crown the whole Cranfield himself, at the request of the council, undertook a tour to New-York to solicit the governor, Dongan, for a number of the Mohawks to come down and destroy the eastern Indians;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Records.</NOTE> promising to pay them for their services out of the money which was thus to be raised.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vaughan's Journal.</NOTE></P>
<P>At his return from this excursion, he found himself under some embarrassment in his favourite views, from a letter of the lords of trade, which directed him to make use of an assembly, in raising money on the people. He could not, therefore, avoid calling one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 27.</NOTE> though he immediately dis|solved it, because several of the members were those whom he had formerly order|ed to be made constables. At the same time, in his letters to the secretary of state, he represented the assembly as persons of such a mutinous and rebellious disposition, that it was not safe to let them convene; that they had never given any thing to|ward the support of government; that he was obliged to raise money without them; and that it was impossible for him to serve his majesty's interest without a ship of war to enforce his orders; and finally he de|sired leave to go to the West-Indies for the
<PB N="214" REF="024087_0222_0FC2FF07A9EE5448">
recovery of his health. When this busi|ness was dispatched, warrants were issued for collecting the taxes; which caused fresh murmurings and discontent among the people.</P>
<P>But however disaffected to the governor and his creatures, they were always ready to testify their obedience to the royal or|ders; an instance of which occured at this time. The seas of America and the West-Indies being much infested with pirates, the king sent orders to all the gov|ernors and colony assemblies, directing acts to be made for the suppressing of pi|racy and robbery on the high seas. Cran|field, having received this order, summon|ed an assembly;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 22.</NOTE> and though it consisted almost entirely of the same persons who were in the last; he suffered them to pass the act, and then quietly dissolved them: This was the last assembly that ever he called.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Records, and Files.</NOTE></P>
<P>The tax-bills were first put into the hands of the newly made constables; who soon returned them, informing the gover|nor that the people were so averse to the method, that it was impossible to collect the money. The provost, Thomas Thur|ton, was then commanded to do it, with the assistance of his deputies and the con|stables.
<PB N="215" REF="024087_0223_0FC2FF08C9457D48">
The people still refusing com|pliance, their cattle and goods were taken by distraint and sold by auction: Those who would neither pay nor discover their goods to the officers, were apprehended and imprisoned; and some of the consta|bles, who refused to assist, suffered the same fate. The more considerate of the people were disposed to bear these grievances, though highly irritating, till they could know the result of their applications to the king. But in a country where the love of liberty had ever been the ruling passion, it could not be expected but that some forward spirits would break the restraints of prudence, and take a summary method to put a stop to their oppressions. Several persons had declared that they would sooner part with their lives, than suffer distraints; and associations were formed for mutual support. At Exeter the sheriff was resisted and driven off with clubs; the women having prepared hot spits and scalding water to assist in the opposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 29.</NOTE> as Thurton testified in his deposition on the occasion.

The troop of horse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">January 9.</NOTE> under Mason's command, was then ordered to turn out completely mount|ed and armed, to assist in suppressing the disorder; but when the day came not one trooper appeared. Cranfield thus finding his efforts ineffectual, and his authority contemptible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MSS in files.</NOTE> was obliged to desist.</P>
<P>The agent had been a long time in England, waiting for the depositions, which were to have been transmitted to hin in support of the complaint which he was to exhibit. Cranfield and his crea|tures here did all that they could, to retard the business; first by imprisoning Vaughan, and then by refusing to summon and swear witnesses when applied to by others; who were obliged to go into the neighbouring governments to get their depositions au|thenticated; and after all, the proof was defective, as they had no access to the public records. The agent, however, ex|hibited his complaint against Cranfield in general terms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 11.</NOTE> consisting of eight articles.
<Q>That he had engrossed the power of erect|ing courts, and establishing fees, exclu|sive

of the assembly: That he had not followed the directions in his commission respecting Mason's controversy; but had caused it to be decided on the spot by courts of his own constitution, consisting wholly of persons devoted to his inter|est: That exorbitant charges had been exacted and some who were unable to satisfy them had been imprisoned: That others had been obliged to submit, for want of money to carry on the suits: That he had altered the value of silver money: That he had imprisoned sundry persons without just cause: That he with his council had assumed legislative autho|rity, without an assembly; and, that he had done his utmost to prevent the peo|ple from laying their complaints before the king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> MSS.</NOTE> and procuring the necessary evidence.</Q></P>
<P>'This complaint was, in course,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23.</NOTE> referred to the board of trade; who transmitted copies of it, and of the several proofs, to Cranfield, and summoned him to make his defence; directing him to deliver to the adverse party copies of all the affidavits which should be taken in his favour; to let all persons have free access to the re|cords; and to give all needful assistance to them in collecting their evidence against him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid&punc;</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="024087_0226_0FC2FF1A79F28C88">When he had received this letter he sus|pended Mason's suits, till the question concerning the legality of the courts should be decided. He also ordered the secreta|ry to give copies to those who should ap|ply for them. At the same time it was complained that the people, on their part, had been equally reserved, in secreting the records of the several towns, so that Mason upon inquiry could not find where they were deposited: and the town clerks, when summoned, had solemnly sworn that they knew neither where the books were con|cealed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MSS in the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> nor who had taken them out of their possession.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1685.</NOTE>The necessary evidence on both sides being procured, a new complaint was drawn up, consisting of twelve articles, which were,
<Q>That at the first session of the assembly, Cranfield had challenged the power of legislation and settlement of affairs to himself, against the words of the commission: That he had by pur|chase or mortgage from Mason, made himself owner of the province, and so was not likely to act impartially between Mason and the inhabitants: That he had made courts, whereof both judges and jurors had agreed with Mason for their own lands, and some had taken deeds of
<PB N="219" REF="024087_0227_0FC2FF1B6CB0FE88">
him for other men's lands, so that they were engaged by their interest to set up Mason's title: That Mason had sued forty persons, and cast all; and that the governor's interposal to state the cases, as by his commission he was directed, had been refused though desired: and that the defendants pleas grounded on the laws of England were rejected: That they could not reconcile the verdict with the attachment, nor the execution with the verdict, nor their practise under col|our of the execution with either; that the verdict found the lands sued for ac|cording to the royal commission and in|structions, and that commission only gave power to state the case if Mason and the people could not agree; but the execu|tion took land and all: That the charge of every action was about six pounds, though nothing was done in court but reading the commission and some blank grants without hand or seal; and these were not read for one case in ten: That court charges were exacted in money, which many had not; who though they tendered cattle, were committed to pri|son for non-payment: That ministers, contrary to his majesty's commission, which granted liberty of conscience to all
<PB N="220" REF="024087_0228_0FC2FF1D2A6DB5A8">
protestants, had their dues withheld from them, even those that were due before Cranfield came, and were threatened with six months imprisonment for not admin|istering the sacrament according to the liturgy: That though the general assem|bly agreed that Spanish money should pass by weight, the governor and council ordered pieces of eight to pass for six shil|lings, though under weight: That men were commonly compelled to enter into bonds of great penalty, to appear and an|swer to what should be objected against them, when no crime was alleged: That they had few laws but those made by the governor and council, when his commission directed the general assembly to make laws: That the courts were kept in a remote corner of the province; and the sheriff was a stranger and had no visible estate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weare's MSS.</NOTE> and so was not responsi|ble for failures.</Q></P>
<P>Upon this complaint, an hearing was had before the Lords of Trade on Tuesday the tenth of March; and their lordships reported to the king, on three articles on|ly of the complaint, viz.
<Q>That Cranfield had not pursued his instructions with re|gard to Mason's controversy; but instead thereof had caused courts to be held and
<PB N="221" REF="024087_0229_0FC2FF1F514C0A20">
titles to be decided, with exorbitant costs; and that he had exceeded his power in regulating the value of coins.</Q>
This re|port was accepted, and the king's pleasure therein signified to him. At the same time, his request for absence being grant|ed, he, on receipt of the letters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neal's Hist. and Flitch's MS.</NOTE> privately embarked on board a vessel for Jamacia; and from thence went to England, where he obtained the collectorship of Barbadoes. At his departure, Barefoote the deputy-governor took the chair; which he held till he was superseded by Dudley's com|mission, as president of New-England.</P>
<P>Cranfield's ill conduct must be ascribed in a great measure to his disappointment of the gains which he expected to acquire, by the establishment of Mason's title; which could be his only inducement to ac|cept of the government. This disappoint|ment inflaming his temper, naturally vin|dictive and imperious, urged him to ac|tions not only illegal, but cruel and un|manly. A ruler never degrades his cha|racter more than when he perverts public justice to gratify personal resentment; he should punish none but the enemies of the laws, and disturbers of the peace of the community over which he presides. Had there been the least colour, either of zeal
<PB N="222" REF="024087_0230_0FC2FF2C54B9C558">
or policy, for the severity exercised in the prosecution of Moody, candour would oblige us to make some allowance for hu|man frailty. His ordering the members of the assembly to be made constables, was a mode of revenge disgraceful to the cha|racter of the supreme magistrate. From the same base disposition, he is said to have employed spies and pimps,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neal. vol. 2. p. 39.</NOTE> to find matter of accusation against people in their clubs, and private discourse. And his deceit was equal to his malice; for, being at Boston when the charter of that colony was call|ed in question, and the people were soli|citous to ward off the danger; he advised them to make a private offer of two thou|sand guineas to the king, promising to re|present them in a favourable light; but when they, not suspecting his intention, fol|lowed his advice, and shewed him the let|ter which they had written to their agents for that purpose, he treacherously represent|ed them as "disloyal rogues;" and made them appear so ridiculous that their agents were ashamed to be seen at court.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. vol. 1. page 337.</NOTE> How|ever, when he had quitted the country, and had time for reflection he grew a|shamed of his misconduct, and whilst he was collector at Barbadoes, made a point of treating the masters of vessels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fitch's MS&punc;</NOTE> and other
<PB N="223" REF="024087_0231_0FC2FF2FBB19EDB8">
persons who went thither from Pascataqua, with particular respect.</P>
<P>Although the decision of titles in Cran|field's courts had been represented, in the report of the lords, as extrajudicial, and a royal order had been thereupon issued to suspend any farther proceedings in the case of Mason till the matter should be brought before the king in council, pursuant to the directions in the commission; yet Bare|foote suffered executions which had before been issued to be extended, and persons to be imprisoned at Mason's suit. This oc|casioned a fresh complaint and petition to the king, which was sent by Weare, who about this time made a second voyage to England, as agent for the province and attorney to Vaughan, to manage an ap|peal from several verdicts, judgments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weare's MSS.</NOTE> decrees and fines which had been given against him in the courts here, one of which was on the title to his estate.

<P>That nothing might be wanting to shew the enmity of the people to these measures, and their hatred and contempt for the authors of them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">MSS in files.</NOTE> there are still pre|served the original depositions on oath, of Barefoote and Mason, relating to an assault made on their persons by Thomas Wiggen and Anthony Nutter, who had been members of the assembly.

But Wiggen being a stronger man seized him by his cravat, and threw him into the fire; where his clothes and one of his legs were burned. Barefoote, attempting to help him, met with the same fate, and had two of his ribs broken and one of his teeth beaten out in the struggle.

<P>Nothing else occured during Barefoote's short administration, except a treaty of friendship, between the Indians of Pena|cook and Saco, on the one part; and the people of New-Hampshire and Maine on the other. The foundation of this treaty seems to have been laid in Cranfield's pro|ject of bringing down the Mohawks on the eastern Indians; which had once before proved a pernicious measure; as they made no distinction between those tribes which were at peace with the English, and those which were at war. Some of the Pena|cook Indians who had been at Albany af|ter Cranfield's journey to New-York, re|ported on their return, that the Mohawks threatened destruction to all the eastern
<PB N="226" REF="024087_0234_0FC2FF3E0167FC40">
Indians, from Narrhaganset to Pechypscot&punc; Hagkins, a chief of the tribe, had inform|ed Cranfield in the spring of the danger he apprehended, and had implored assist|ance and protection, but had been treated with neglect. In August the Penacook and Saco Indians gathered their corn, and removed their families; which gave an alarm to their English neighbours, as if they were preparing for war. Messengers being sent to demand the reason of their movement, were informed that it was the fear of the Mohawks, whom they daily expected to destroy them; and being asked why they did not come in among the English for protection, they answered, lest the Mohawks should hurt the English on their account. Upon this they were persuaded to enter into an agreement; and accordingly their chiefs being assembled with the council of New-Hampshire, and a deputation from the province of Maine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Septemb. 8.</NOTE> a treaty was concluded, wherein it was stipulated, that all future personal injuries on either side should, upon complaint, be immediately redressed; that information should be given of approaching danger from enemies; that the Indians should not remove their families from the neigh|bourhood of the English without giving

timely notice, and if they did, that it should be taken for a declaration of war; and, that whilst these articles were observed the English would assist and protect them against the Mohawks and all other ene|mies.

<P>WHEN an arbitrary government is determined to infringe the liber|ty of the people, it is easy to find preten|ces to support the most unrighteous claims. King Charles the second in the lat|ter part of his reign was making large strides towards despotism. Charters, which obstructed his pernicious views, were by a perversion of the law decreed forfeited. The city of London, and most of the cor|porations in England, either suffered the execution of these sentences, or tamely surrendered their franchises to the all-grasping hand of power. It could not be expected that in this general wreck of privileges the colonies of New-England could escape. The people of Massachu|setts had long been viewed with a jealous eye.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch. col. pap. p. 377.</NOTE> Though the king had repeatedly assured them of his protection and sol|emnly
<PB N="229" REF="024087_0237_0FC2FF47F9D4A830">
confirmed their charter privileges; yet their spirit and principles were so to|tally dissonant to the corrupt views of the court, that intriguing men found easy ac|cess to the royal ear, with complaints against them. Of these the most invete|rate and indefatigable was Randolph,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch. vol. 1. p. 329.</NOTE> who made no less than eight voyages in nine years across the Atlantic, on this mischiev|ous business. They were accused of ex|tending their jurisdiction beyond the bounds of their patent; of invading the prerogative by coining money; of not al|lowing appeals to the king from their courts; and, of obstructing the execution of the navigation and trade laws. By the king's command agents were sent over to answer these complaints. They found the prejudice against the colony so strong, that it was in vain to withstand it; and solicited instructions whether to submit to the king's pleasure, or to let the proceed|ings against them be issued in form of law. A solemn consultation being held, at which the clergy assisted, it was determined
<Q>to die by the hands of others rather than by their own.</Q>
Upon notice of this, the agents quitted England; and Ran|dolph,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1683 October.</NOTE> as the angel of death soon followed them, bringing a writ of <HI>quo warranto</HI>
<PB N="230" REF="024087_0238_0FC2FF53B1234110">
from the king's bench; but the <HI>scire facias</HI> which issued from the chancery did not arrive till the time fixed for their appear|ance was elapsed: This however was deemed too trivial an error to stop the proceedings; judgment was entered against them, and the charter declared forfeited.</P>
<P>The king died before a new form of government was settled;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1685. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eb. 6.</NOTE> but there could be no hope of favour from his successor, who inherited the arbitrary principles of his brother, and was publickly known to be a bigoted papist.</P>
<P>The intended alteration in the govern|ment was introduced in the same gradual manner as it had been in New-Hampshire. A commission was issued, in which Joseph Dudley, esquire, was appointed president of his majesty's territory and dominion of New-England; William Stoughton, dep|uty president; Simon Bradstreet, Robert Mason, John Fitz Winthrop, John Pyn|chon, Peter Bulkeley, Edward Randolph, Wait Winthrop, Richard Warton, John Usher, Nathaniel Saltonstall, Bartho|lomew Gedney, Jonathan Tyng, Dud|ley Bradstreet, John Hinckes, and Ed|ward Tyng, counsellors. Their juris|diction extended over Massachusetts, New-Hampshire, Maine and the Narrhagan|set or King's province. These gentle|men
<PB N="231" REF="024087_0239_0FC2FF596F35FFA0">
were mostly natives of the country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1686.</NOTE> some of them had been magistrates, and one of them governor under the charter. No house of deputies was mentioned in the commission.</P>
<P>The new form of government took place on the twenty-fifth day of May; and on the tenth of June an order of council was issued for settling the county courts, which consisted of such members of the council as resided in each county, and any others of them who might be present; with such justices as were commissioned for the pur|pose. These courts had the power of try|ing and issuing all civil causes, and all criminal matters under life or limb; from them an appeal was allowed to a superior court held three times in the year at Boston, for the whole territory; and from thence appeals, in certain cases, might be had to the king in council. Juries were pricked by the marshal and one justice of each county, in a list given them by the select|men of the towns. A probate court was held at Boston, by the president, and
<Q>in the other provinces and remote counties</Q>
by a judge and clerk appointed by the president. The territory was divided into four counties, viz. Suffolk, Middlesex, Essex and Hampshire; and three provinc|es, viz. New-Hampshire, Maine, and
<PB N="232" REF="024087_0240_0FC2FF60A97CD598">
King's province. By another order of the same date, town-taxes could not be assessed but by allowance of two justices;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Printed or|ders in the files.</NOTE> and the members of the council were exempted from paying any part thereof.</P>
<P>Things were conducted with tolerable decency, and the innovations were render|ed as little grievous as possible; that the people might be induced more readily to submit to the long meditated introduction of a governor-general.</P>
<P>In December following, Sir Edmund Androsse who had been governor of New-York,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 30.</NOTE> arrived at Boston with a commission appointing him captain-general and gov|ernor in chief of the territory and domin|ion of New-England, in which the col|ony of Plymouth was now included. By this commission, the governor with his council, five of whom were a quorum, were impowered to make such laws&punc; im|pose such taxes, and apply them to such purposes as they should think proper. They were also empowered to grant lands on such terms and subject to such quit|rents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Copy o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Commis|sion.</NOTE> as should be appointed by the king. Invested with such powers, these men were capable of the most extravagant actions. Though Androsse, like his master, began his administration with the fairest profes|sions,
<PB N="233" REF="024087_0241_0FC2FF61F07E90E8">
yet like him, he soon violated them, and proved himself a fit instrument for ac|complishing the most execrable designs. Those of his council who were backward in aiding his rapacious intentions were neglected. Seven being sufficient for a full board, he selected such only as were devoted to him, and with their concurrence did what he pleased. Randolph and Ma|son were at first among his confidents; but afterward when New-York was an|nexed to his government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. vol. 1. p. 344. Collect. pap. p. 564.</NOTE> the members from that quarter were most in his favour.</P>
<P>To particularize the many instances of tyranny and oppression which the country suffered from these men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1687.</NOTE> is not within the design of this work. Let it suffice to ob|serve, that the press was restrained; liber|ty of conscience infringed; exorbitant fees and taxes demanded, without the voice or consent of the people, who had no privi|lege of representation. The charter being vacated, it was pretended that all titles to land were annulled; and as to Indian deeds, Androsse declared them no better than
<Q>the scratch of a bear's paw.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolution in N. Eng. justified, p. 21.</NOTE></Q>
Land|holders were obliged to take out patents for their estates which they had possessed forty or fifty years; for these patents ex|travagant fees were exacted, and those who
<PB N="234" REF="024087_0242_0FC2FF6371FC66E8">
would not submit to this imposition had writs of intrusion brought against them, and their land was patented to others. To hinder the people from consulting about the redress of their grievances, town-meetings were prohibited, except one in the month of May for the choice of town officers; and to prevent complaints being carried to England, no person was permit|ted to go out of the country without ex|press leave from the governor. But not|withstanding all the vigilance of the gov|ernor, his emissaries and his guards, the resolute and indefatigable Increase Mather,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&punc; Mather's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e p. 107.</NOTE> minister of the second church in Boston, and president of the college, got on board a ship and sailed for England, with com|plaints in the name of the people against the governor, which he delivered with his own hand to the king; but finding no hope of redress, he waited the event of the revolution which was then expected.</P>
<P>When the people groaned under so many real grievances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1688.</NOTE> it is no wonder that their fears and jealousies suggested some that were imaginary. They believed Androsse to be a papist; that he had hired the In|dians, and supplied them with ammuni|tion to destroy their frontier settlements;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolution justified, p. 29, 40.</NOTE> and that he was preparing to betray the

country into their hands of the French. At the same time, the large strides that King James the second was making toward the establishment of popery and despotism, raised the most terrible apprehensions; so that the report of the landing of the Prince of Orange in England was received here with the greatest joy. Androsse was so alarmed at the news, that he imprisoned the man who brought a copy of the prince's declaration, and published a proclamation commanding all persons to be in readiness to oppose "any invasion from Holland," which met with as much disregard as one he had issued before, appointing a day of thanksgiving for the birth of a Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>The people had now borne these inno|vations and impositions for about three years: Their patience was worn out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1689.</NOTE> and their native love of freedom kindled at the prospect of deliverance. The news of a complete revolution in England had not reached them; yet so sanguine were their expectations, so eager were they to prove that they were animated by the same spirit with their brethren at home, that upon the rumour of an intended massacre in the town of Boston by the governor's guards, they were wrought up to a degree of fury.

On the morning of the eighteenth of April the town was in arms, and the country flocking in to their assistance. The gov|ernor, and those who had fled with him to the fort, were seized and committed to prison. The gentlemen who had been magistrates under the charter, with Brad|street, the late governor, at their head, assumed the name of a council of safety, and kept up a form of government, in the exigency of affairs, till orders arrived from England; when Androsse and his accom|plices were sent home as prisoners of state, to be disposed of according to the king's pleasure.</P>

The new judges delayed issuing executions on the judgments which he had formerly recover|ed, and the attorney-general, Graham, would not allow that he had power to grant lands by leases. This confirmed the people in their opinion of the invalidity of his claim, and rendered them (if possi|ble) more averse to him than ever they had been.

<HEAD>CHAP. X. The war with the French and Indians, commonly called King William's war.</HEAD>
<P>IT was the misfortune of this country to have enemies of different kinds to con|tend with at the same time. Whilst the changes above related were taking place in their government, a fresh war broke out on their frontiers, which, though as|cribed to divers causes, was really kindled by the rashness of the same persons who were making havock of their liberties.</P>
<P>The lands from Penobscot to Nova-Sco|tia&punc; had been ceded to the French, by the treaty of Breda,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. coll. pap. p. 548.</NOTE> in exchange for the island of St. Christopher. On these lands the Baron de St. Castine had for many years resided, and carried on a large trade with the Indians; with whom he was intimate|ly connected; having several of their wom|en, beside a daughter of the sachem Ma|dokawando, for his wives. The lands which had been granted by the crown of England to the duke of York (now King James the second) interfered with Castine's plantation, as the duke claimed to the riv|er St. Croix. A fort had been built by
<PB N="243" REF="024087_0251_0FC2FF95B2353DB0">
his order at Pemaquid, and a garrison sta|tioned there to prevent any intrusion on his property. In 1686 a ship belonging to Pascataqua landed some wines at Penob|scot, supposing it to be within the French territory. Palmer and West, the duke's agents at Pemaquid, went and seized the wines; but by the influence of the French ambassador in England an order was ob|tained for the restoration of them. Here|upon a new line was run which took Cas|tine's plantation into the duke's territory. In the spring of 1688,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1688.</NOTE> Androsse went in the Rose frigate, and plundered Castine's house and fort; leaving only the orna|ments of his chapel to console him for the loss of his arms and goods. This base ac|tion provoked Castine to excite the In|dians to a new war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. coll. pap. p. 562.</NOTE> pretences for which were not wanting on their part. They complained that the tribute of corn which had been promised by the treaty of 1678, had been withholden; that the fishery of the river Saco had been obstructed by seines; that their standing corn had been devour|ed by cattle belonging to the English; that their lands at Pemaquid had been patent|ed without their consent; and that they had been fraudulently dealt with in trade. Some of these complaints were doubtless
<PB N="244" REF="024087_0252_0FC2FF9775B24EB0">
well grounded; but none of them were ever inquired into or redressed.</P>
<P>They began to make reprisals at North Yarmouth by killing cattle. Justice Black|man ordered sixteen of them to be seized and kept under guard at Falmouth; but others continued to rob and captivate the inhabitants. Androsse, who pretended to treat the Indians with mildness, command|ed those whom Blackman had seized to be set at liberty. But this mildness had not the desired effect; the Indians kept their prisoners, and murdered some of them in their barbarous frolicks. Androsse then changed his measures, and thought to frighten them, with an army of seven hun|dred men, which he led into their coun|try in the month of November. The rigor of the season proved fatal to some of his men; but he never saw an Indian in his whole march. The enemy were quiet during the winter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1689.</NOTE>After the revolution, the gentlemen who assumed the government took some precautions to prevent the renewal of hos|tilities. They sent messengers and pre|sents to several tribes of Indians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchinson, Neal, and Mather.</NOTE> who an|swered them with fair promises; but their prejudice against the English was too in|veterate to be allayed by such means as these.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="024087_0253_0FC2FF9EA3F4C1F8">Thirteen years had almost elapsed since the seizure of the four hundred Indians, at Cochecho, by Major Waldron; during all which time, an inextinguishable thirst of revenge had been cherished among them, which never till now found opportunity for gratification<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The inveteracy of their hatred to Major Waldron on account of that transaction, appears from what is related by Mr. Williams in the narrative of his captivity, which happened in 1704.

page 18.</NOTE>. Wonolanset, one of the sachems of Penacook, who was dismissed with his people at the time of the seizure, always observed his father's dying charge not to quarrel with the English; but Hag|kins, another sachem, who had been treated with neglect by Cranfield, was more ready to listen to the seducing invitations of Castine's emissaries. Some of those In|dians, who were then seized and sold into slavery abroad, had found their way home, and could not rest till they had revenge. Accordingly a confederacy being formed between the tribes of Penacook and Pig|wacket, and the strange Indians (as they were called) who were incorporated with them, it was determined to surprise the major and his neighbours among whom they had all this time been peacably con|versant.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="024087_0254_0FC2FFA173A943F8">In that part of the town of Dover which lies about the first falls in the rive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Co|checho, were five garrisoned houses; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ree on the North side, viz. Waldron's, Otis's and Heard's; and two on the south side, viz. Peter Coffin's and his son's. These houses were surrounded with timber-walls, the gates of which, as well the house doors, were secured with bolts and bars. The neighbouring families retired to these houses by night; but by an unaccountable negligence no watch was kept. The In|dians who were daily passing through the town visiting and trading with the inhab|itants, as usual in times of peace, viewed their situation with an attentive eye. Some hints of a mischievous design had been given out by their squaws; but in such dark and ambiguous terms that no one could comprehend their meaning. Some of the people were uneasy; but Waldron who, from a long course of experience, was in|timately acquainted with the Indians, and on other occasions had been ready enough to suspect them, was now so thoroughly secure, that when some of the people hint|ed their fears to him, he merrily bade them to go and plant their pumpkins, saying that he would tell them when the Indians would break out. The very even|ing

before the mischief was done, being told by a young man that the town was full of Indians and the people were much concerned; he answered that he knew the Indians very well and there was no danger.</P>
<P>The plan which the Indians had pre-concerted was, that two squaws should go to each of the garrisoned houses in the evening, and ask leave to lodge by the fire; that in the night when the people were asleep they should open the doors and gates, and give the signal by a whistle; upon which the strange Indians, who were to be within hearing, should rush in, and take their long meditated revenge. This plan being ripe for execution, on the evening of Thursday the twenty-seventh of June, two squaws applied to each of the garrisons for lodging, as they frequent|ly did in time of peace. They were ad|mitted into all but the younger Coffin's, and the people, at their request, shewed them how to open the doors, in case they should have occasion to go out in the night. Mesandowit, one of their chiefs, went to Waldron's garrison, and was kindly enter|tained, as he had often been before. The squaws told the major, that a number of Indians were coming to trade with him the next day, and Mesandowit whilst at
<PB N="248" REF="024087_0256_0FC2FFA92D1759A8">
supper, with his usual familiarity, said,
<Q>Brother Waldron, what would you do if the strange Indians should come?</Q>
The major carelessly answered, that he could assemble an hundred men by lifting up his finger. In this unsuspecting confidence the family retired to rest.</P>
<P>When all was quiet the gates were open|ed and the signal was given. The Indians entered, set a guard at the door, and rush|ed into the major's apartment, which was an inner room, Awakened by the noise, he jumped out of bed, and though now advanced in life to the age of eighty years, he retained so much vigour as to drive them with his sword, through two or three doors; but as he was returning for his other arms, they came behind him, stun|ned him with an hatchet, drew him into his hall, and seating him in an elbow chair on a long table, insultingly asked him,
<Q>Who shall judge Indians now?</Q>
They then obliged the people in the house to get them some victuals; and when they had done eating, they cut the major across the breast and belly with knives, each one with a stroke, saying,
<Q>I cross out my ac|count.</Q>
They then cut off his nose and ears, forcing them into his mouth; and when spent with the loss of blood he was
<PB N="249" REF="024087_0257_0FC2FFB2EE861C48">
falling down from the table, one of them held his own sword under him, which put an end to his misery. They also killed his son in law Abraham Lee; but took his daughter Lee with several others, and having pillaged the house, left it on fire. Otis's garrison, which was next to the major's, met with the same fate; he was killed, with several others, and his wife and child were captivated. Heard's was saved by the barking of a dog just as the Indians were entering: Elder Wentworth, who was awakened by the noise pushed them out, and falling on his back, set his feet against the gate and held it till he had alarmed the people; two balls were fired through it, but both missed him. Coffin's house was surprized, but as the Indians had no particular enmity to him, they spared his life, and the lives of his family, and contented themselves with pillaging the house. Finding a bag of money, they made him throw it by handfuls on the floor, whilst they amused themselves in scrambling for it. They then went to the house of his son who would not admit the squaws in the evening, and summoned him to surrender, promising him quarter: He declined their offer and determined to de|fend his house, till they brought out his
<PB N="250" REF="024087_0258_0FC2FFB4DB0CED40">
father and threatened to kill him before his eyes: Filial affection then overcame his resolution, and he surrendered. They put both families together into a deserted house, intending to reserve them for pris|oners; but whilst the Indians were busy in plundering, they all escaped.</P>
<P>Twenty three people were killed in this surprisal, and twenty nine were captivat|ed; five or six houses, with the mills, were burned; and so expeditious were the Indians in the execution of their plot, that before the people could be collected from the other parts of the town to oppose them, they fled with their prisoners and booty. As they passed by Heard's garrison in their retreat, they fired upon it; but the people being prepared and resolved to defend it, and the enemy being in haste, it was pre|served. The preservation of its owner was more remarkable.</P>
<P>Elizabeth Heard, with her three sons and a daughter, and some others, were re|turning in the night from Portsmouth. They passed up the river in their boat un|perceived by the Indians, who were then in possession of the houses;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1689.</NOTE> but suspecting danger by the noise which they heard, after they had landed they betook them|selves to Waldron's garrison, where
<PB N="251" REF="024087_0259_0FC2FFBE921A2BA8">
they saw lights, which they imagined were set up for direction to those who might be seeking a refuge. They knocked and begged earnestly for admis|sion; but no answer being given, a young man of the company climbed up the wall, and saw, to his inexpressible surprize, an Indian standing in the door of the house, with his gun. The woman was so over|come with the fright that she was unable to fly; but begged her children to shift for themselves; and they with heavy hearts, left her. When she had a little recovered she crawled into some bushes, and lay there till day-light. She then perceived an Indian coming toward her with a pistol in his hand; he looked at her and went away; returning, he looked at her again; and she asked him what he would have; he made no answer; but ran yelling to the house, and she saw him no more. She kept her place till the house was burned, and the Indians were gone; and then re|turning home, found her own house safe. Her preservation in these dangerous cir|cumstances was the more remarkable, if (as it is supposed) it was an instance of justice and gratitude in the Indians. For at the time when the four hundred were seized in 1676, a young Indian escaped
<PB N="252" REF="024087_0260_0FC2FFBFA7B2A8A0">
and took refuge in her house, where she concealed him; in return for which kind|ness he promised her that he would never kill her, nor any of her family in any fu|ture war, and that he would use his influ|ence with the other Indians to the same purpose. This Indian was one of the party who surprised the place, and she was well known to the most of them.</P>
<P>The same day, after the mischief was done, a letter from Secretary Addington, written by order of the government, di|rected to Major Waldron, giving him no|tice of the intention of the Indians to sur|prize him under pretence of trade, fell in|to the hands of his son. This design was communicated to Governor Bradstreet by Major Henchman of Chelmsford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mass. Rec.</NOTE> who had learned it of the Indians: The letter was dispatched from Boston,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Appendix No. 47.</NOTE> the day be|fore, by Mr. Weare; but some delay which he met with at Newbury ferry prevented its arrival in season.</P>
<P>The prisoners taken at this time were mostly carried to Canada, and sold to the French; and these, as far as I can learn, were the first that ever were carried thither<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>One of these prisoners was Sarah G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rrish, a remarkably fine child of seven years old, and grand-daughter of Major Waldron, in whose house she lodged that fatal night. Some circumstances attending her captivity are tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly affecting. When she was awaken|ed by the noise of the Indians in the house, she crept into ano|ther bed and hid herself under the clothes to escape their search. She remained in their hands till the next winter, and was fold from one to another several times. An Indian girl once pushed her into a river; but, catching by the bushes, she escaped drown|ing, yet durst not tell how she came to be wet. Once she was so weary with travelling that she she did not awake in the morning till the Indians were gone, and then found herself alone in the woods, covered with s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow and without any food; having found their tracks she went crying after them till they heard her and took her with them. At another time they kindled a great fire, and the young Indians told her she was to be roasted. She burst into tears, threw her arms round her master's neck, and begged him to save her, which he promised to do if she would behave well. Being arrived in Canada, she was bought by the Intendant's lady, who treated her courteously, and sent her to a nunnery for education. But when Sir William Phips was at Quebeck she was exchanged, and returned to her friends, with whom she lived till she was six|teen years old.</P>
<P>The wife of Richard Otis was taken at the same time, with an infant daughter of three months old. The French priests took this child under their care, baptized her by the name of Christina, and educated her in the Romish religion. She passed some time in a nunery, but declined taking the veil, and was married to a Frenchman, by whom she had two children. But her desire to see New-England was so strong, that upon an exchange of prisoners in 1714, being then a widow, she left both her children, who were not permitted to come with her, and returned home, where she abjured the Romish faith. M. Siguenot, her former confessor, wrote her a flattering letter, warning her of her danger, inviting her to return to the bosom of the catholic church, and repeating many gross calumnies which had formerly been vented against L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ther and the other reformers. This letter being shewn to Gover|nor Burnet, he wrote her a sensible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sterly answer, refuting the arguments, and detecting the falsehoods it contained: Both these letters were printed. She was married afterward to Capt. Thomas Baker, who had been taken at Deerfield in 1704, and lived in Dover, where she was born, till the year 1773.</P>
<P>Mr. John Emerson, by declining to lodge at Major Waldron's on the fatal night, though strongly urged, met with an happy escape. He was afterward a minister at New-Castle and Ports|mouth.</P>

The Indians had been seduced to the French interest by popish emissaries, who
<PB N="254" REF="024087_0262_0FC2FFCA56D43D00">
had began to fascinate them with their religious and national prejudices. They had now learned to call the English here|ticks, and that to extirpate them as such was meritorious in the sight of heaven. When their minds were filled with religi|ous phrenzy, they became more bitter and implacable enemies than before; and find|ing the sale of scalps and prisoners turn to good account in Canada, they had still farther incitement to continue their de|predations, and prosecute their vengeance.</P>
<P>The necessity of vigorous measures was now so pressing, that parties were imme|diately dispatched, one under Captain Noyes to Penacook, where they destroyed the corn, but the Indians escaped; another from Pascataqua, under Captain Wincal, to Winnipiseogee, whither the Indians had retired, as John Church, who had been ta|ken at Cochecho and escaped from them, reported: One or two Indians were killed there, and their corn cut down. But these excursions proved of small service, as the Indians had little to lose, and could find an home wherever they could find game and fish.</P>
<P>In the month of August Major Swaine, with seven or eight companies raised by the Massachusetts government, marched
<PB N="255" REF="024087_0263_0FC2FFCBAA01FB88">
to the eastward; and Major Church, with another party, consisting of English and Indians from the colony of Plymouth, soon followed them. Whilst these forces were on their march, the Indians, who lay in the woods about Oyster river, observ|ed how many men belonged to Huck|ing's garrison; and seeing them all go out one morning to work, nimbly ran between them and the house, and killed them all (being in number eighteen) except one who had passed the brook. They then attacked the house, in which were only two boys (one of whom was lame) with some women and children. The boys kept them off for some time and wounded sever|al of them. At length the Indians set the house on fire, and even then the boys would not surrender till they had promised them to spare their lives. They perfidi|ously murdered three or four of the chil|dren; one of them was set on a sharp stake, in the view of its distressed mother, who with the other w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">men and the boys were carried captive. One of the boys escaped the next day. Captain Garner with his company pursued the enemy, but did not come up with them.</P>
<P>The Massachusetts and Plymouth com|panies proceeded to the eastward, settled

garrisons in convenient places, and had some skirmishes with the enemy at Casco and Blue Point. On their return, Major Swaine sent a party of the Indian auxiliaries under Lieutenant Flagg toward Winni|piseogee to make discoveries. These In|dians held a consultation in their own language; and having persuaded their lieutenant with two men to return, nine|teen of them tarried out eleven days longer; in which time they found the enemy, staid with them two nights, and informed them of every thing which they desired to know; upon which the enemy retired to their inaccessible desarts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magnalia, lib. 7. p. 67.</NOTE> the forces returned without finding them, and in November were disbanded.</P>
<P>Nothing was more welcome to the dis|tressed inhabitants of the frontiers than the approach of winter, as they then expected a respite from their sufferings. The deep snows and cold weather were commonly a good security against an attack from the Indians but when resolutely set on mischief, and instigated by popish en|thusiasm, no obstacles could prevent the execution of their purposes.</P>
<P>The Count de Frontenac, then governor of Canada,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1690.</NOTE> was fond of distinguishing himself by some enterprizes against the
<PB N="257" REF="024087_0265_0FC2FFD92C38FBE0">
American subjects of King William, with whom his master was at war in Europe. For this purpose he detached three parties of French and Indians from Canada in the winter, who were to take three different routes into the English territories. One of these parties marched from Montreal and destroyed Schenectada, a Dutch village on the Mohawk river, in the province of New-York. This action which happened at an unusual time of the year, in the month of February, alarmed the whole country; and the eastern settlements were ordered to be on their guard. On the eighteenth day of March, another party which came from Trois Rivieres, under the command of the Sieur Hertel, an officer of great repute in Canada, found their way to Salmon falls, a settlement on the river which divides New-Hampshire from the province of Maine. This party consisted of fifty two men, of whom twenty five were Indians under Hoophood a noted warrior. They began the attack at day-break, in three different places. The people were sur|prized; but flew to arms and defended themselves in the garrisoned houses, with a bravery which the enemy themselves applauded. But as in all such onsets the assailants have the greatest advantage, so

they here proved too strong for the defen|dants; about thirty of the bravest were killed, and the rest surrendered at discre|tion, to the number of fifty four, of whom the greater part were women and children.

<P>Robert Rogers, a corpulent man, being unable to carry the burden which the Indians imposed upon him, threw it down in the path and went aside in the woods to conceal himself. They found him by his track, stripped, beat and pricked him with their swords; then tied him to a tree and danced round him till they had kindled a fire. They gave him time to pray, and take leave of his fellow-prisoners who were placed round the fire to see his death. They pushed the fire toward him, and when he was almost stifled, took it away to give him time to breathe, and thus prolonged his misery; they drowned his dying groans with their hideous singing and yelling; all the while dancing round the fire, cutting off pieces of his flesh and throwing them in his face. When he was dead they left his body broiling on the coals, in which state it was found by his friends, and buried.</P>

The Indians then came up westward, and a party of them under Hoophood sometime in May made an assault on Fox Point, [in Newington] where they burned several houses, killed about fourteen people, and carried away six. They were pursued by the Captains Floyd and Greenleaf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mag. lib. 7. p. 73.</NOTE> who came up with them and recovered some of the captives and spoil, after a skirmish in which Hoophood was wounded and lost his gun. This fellow was soon after kill|ed by a party of Canada Indians who mistook him for one of the Iroquois, with whom they were at war.

<P>The people of New-England now look|ed on Canada as the source of their troubles, and formed a design to reduce it to subjec|tion to the crown of England. The en|terprize was bold and hazardous; and had their ability been equal to the ardour of their patriotism it might probably have been accomplished. By straining every nerve, they equipped an armament in some degree equal to the service. What was want|ing in military and naval discipline was made up in resolution; and the command
<PB N="263" REF="024087_0271_0FC2FFF52F91E6F8">
was given to Sir William Phips, an honest man, and a friend to his country; but by no means qualified for such an attempt. Una|voidable accidents retarded the expedition, so that the fleet did not arrive before Quebec till October; when it was more than time to return. It being impossible to continue there to any purpose; and the troops growing sickly and discouraged, after some inef|fectual parade, they abandoned the enter|prize.</P>
<P>This disappointment was severely felt. The equipment of the fleet and army re|quired a supply of money which could not readily be collected, and occasioned a pa|per currency; which has often been drawn into precedent on like occasions, and has proved a fatal source of the most compli|cated and extensive mischief. The peo|ple were almost dispirited with the pros|pect of poverty and ruin. In this melan|choly state of the country, it was an hap|py circumstance that the Indians volunta|rily came in with a flag of truce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 29.</NOTE> and de|sired a cessation of hostilities. A conference being held at Sagadahock, they brought in ten captives, and settled a truce till the first day of May, which they observed till the ninth of June;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1691.</NOTE> when they attacked Storer's garrison at Wells, but were brave|ly

<P>The next winter the country being alarmed with the destruction of York,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1692. Januar. 25.</NOTE> some new regulations were made for the general defence. Major Elisha Hutchinson was appointed commander in chief of the militia; by whose prudent conduct the frontiers were well guarded, and so con|stant a communication was kept up, by ranging parties, from one post to another, that it became impossible for the enemy to attack in their usual way by surprize. The good effect of this regulation was presently seen. A young man being in the woods near Cochecho, was fired at by some Indians. Lieutenant Wilson imme|diately went out with eighteen men; and finding the Indians, killed or wounded the whole party excepting one. This struck a terror and kept them quiet the remainder of the winter and spring. But on the tenth day of June, an army of French and Indians made a furious attack
<PB N="265" REF="024087_0273_0FC2FFFDA6D39340">
on Storer's garrison at Wells, where Cap|tain Convers commanded; who after a brave and resolute defence, was so happy as to drive them off with great loss.</P>
<P>Sir William Phips, being now governor of Massachusetts, continued the same me|thod of defence; keeping out continual scouts under brave and experienced officers. This kept the Indians so quiet that, ex|cept one poor family which they took at Oyster river, and some small mischief at Quaboag, there is no mention of any des|truction made by them during the year 1693.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1693.</NOTE> Their animosity against New-Eng|land was not quelled; but they needed a space to recruit; some of their principal men were in captivity, and they could not hope to redeem them without a peace.

This peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mag. p. 85.</NOTE> or rather truce, gave both sides a respite, which both earnestly desired.</P>
<P>The people of New-Hampshire were much reduced; their lumber trade and

husbandry being greatly impeded by the war. Frequent complaints were made of the burden of the war, the scarcity of pro|visions, and the dispiritedness of the peo|ple. Once, it is said in the council minutes that they were even ready to quit the pro|vince. The governor was obliged to im|press men to guard the outposts; they were sometimes dismissed for want of pro|visions, and then the garrisoned officers were called to account and severely punished: Yet all this time the public debt did not ex|ceed four hundred pounds. In this situation, they were obliged to apply to their neigh|bours for assistance; but this was granted with a sparing hand. The people of Mas|sachusetts were much divided and at vari|ance among themselves, both on account of the new charter which they had receiv|ed from King William, and the pretend|ed witchcrafts which have made so loud a noise in the world. Party and passion had usurped the place of patriotism; and the defence, not only of their neighbours, but of themselves was neglected to grati|fy their malignant humours. Their gov|ernor too had been affronted in this prov|ince, on the following occasion.</P>
<P>Sir William Phips, having had a quar|rel with Captain Short of the Nonsuch fri|gate
<PB N="267" REF="024087_0275_0FC30001CE7650F8">
about the extent of his power as vice admiral, arrested Short at Boston, and put him on board a merchant ship bound for England, commanded by one Tay, with a warrant to deliver him to the secretary of state. The ship put into Pascataqua, and the Nonsuch came in after her. The lieutenant, Cary, sent a letter to Hinckes, president of the council threatening to im|press seamen if Short was not released. Cary was arrested and brought before the council, where he received a reprimand for his insolence. At the same time Sir William came hither by land, went on board Tay's ship, and sent the cabbin-boy with a message to the president to come to him there; which Hinckes highly resent|ed and refused. Phips then demanded of Tay his former warrant, and issued anoth|er commanding the re-delivery of Short to him, broke open Short's chest, and seized his papers. This action was looked upon by some as an exertion of power to which he had no right, and it was pro|posed to cite him before the council to an|swer for assuming authority out of his ju|risdiction. The president was warm;<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 30.</NOTE> but a majority of the council, considering Sir William's opinion that his vice admiral's commission extended to this province,

(though Usher had one, but was not present) and that no person belonging to the province had been injured,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iles.</NOTE> advised the president to take no farther notice of the matter. Soon after this Sir William drew off the men whom he had stationed in this province as soldiers; and the council advised the lieutenant governor to apply to the colony of Connecticut for men and provisions; but whether this request was granted does not appear.</P>
<P>The towns of Dover and Exeter being more exposed than Portsmouth or Hamp|ton suffered the greatest share in the com|mon calamity. Nothing but the hope of better times kept alive their fortitude. When many of the eastern settlements were wholly broken up, they stood their ground, and thus gained to themselves a reputation which their posterity boast of to this day.</P>
<P>The engagements made by the Indians in the treaty of Pemaquid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1694.</NOTE> might have been performed if they had been left to their own choice. But the French mission|aries had been for some years very assidu|ous in propagating their tenets among them, one of which was

The Sieur de Villieu, who had distinguished

himself in defence of Quebec when Phips was before it, and had contracted a strong antipathy to the New-Englanders, being then in command at Penobscot, he with M. Thury, the missionary, diverted Ma|dokawando and the other sachems from complying with their engagements; so that pretences were found for detaining the English captives, who were more in number, and of more consequence than the hostages whom the Indians had given. Influenced by the same pernicious councils, they kept a watchful eye on the frontier towns, to see what place was most secure and might be attacked to the greatest ad|vantage. The settlement at Oyster river, within the town of Dover, was pitched upon as the most likely place; and it is said that the design of surprizing it was publickly talked of at Quebec two months before it was put in execution&punc; Rumours of Indians lurking in the woods there|about made some of the people apprehend danger; but no mischief being attempted, they imagined them to be hunting parties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magnalia&punc; lib&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;</NOTE> and returned to their security.

by a French priest, marched for the devoted place.</P>
<P>Oyster river is a stream which runs into the western branch of Pascataqua; the settlements were on both sides of it, and the houses chiefly near the water. Here were twelve garrisoned houses suf|ficient for the defence of the inhabitants, but apprehending no danger, some fami|lies remained at their own unfortified houses, and those who were in the garri|sons were but indifferently provided for defence, some being even destitute of pow|der. The enemy approached the place un|discovered, and halted near the falls on Tuesday evening, the seventeenth of July. Here they formed two divisions, one of which was to go on each side of the river and plant themselves in ambush, in small parties, near every house, so as to be ready for the attack at the rising of the sun; and the first gun was to be the signal. John Dean, whose house stood by the saw-mill at the falls, intending to go from home very early, arose before the dawn of day, and was shot as he came out of his door. This firing, in part, disconcerted their plan; several parties who had some distance to go, had not then arrived at their stations; the people in general were immediately
<PB N="271" REF="024087_0279_0FC300146B2CB048">
alarmed, some of them had time to make their escape, and others to prepare for their defence. The signal being given, the attack began in all parts where the enemy was ready.</P>
<P>Of the twelve garrisoned houses five were destroyed, viz. Adams's, Drew's, Edgerly's, Medar's and Beard's. They entered Adams's without resistance, where they killed fourteen persons; one of them, being a woman with child, they ripped open. The grave is still to be seen in which they were all buried. Drew sur|rendered his garrison on the promise of security, but was murdered when he fell into their hands; one of his children, a boy of nine years old, was made to run through a lane of Indians, as a mark for them to throw their hatchets at, till they had dispatched him. Edgerly's was eva|cuated; the people took their boat, and one of them was mortally wounded before they got out of reach of the enemy's shot. Beard's and Medar's were also evacuated and the people escaped.</P>
<P>The defenceless houses were nearly all set on fire, the inhabitants being either killed or taken in them, or else in endeav|ouring to fly to the garrisons. Some es|caped by hiding in the bushes and other
<PB N="272" REF="024087_0280_0FC3001A15912DE0">
secret places, Thomas Edgerly, by con|cealing himself in his cellar, preserved his house, though twice set on fire. The house of John Buss, the minister, was de|stroyed, with a valuable library. He was absent, his wife and family fled to the woods and escaped. The wife of John Dean, at whom the first gun was fired, was taken with her daughter, and carried about two miles up the river, where they were left under the care of an old Indian whilst the others returned to their bloody work. The Indian complained of a pain in his head, and asked the woman what would be a proper remedy: she answered, <HI>Occapee,</HI> which is the Indian word for rum, of which she knew he had taken a bottle from her house. The remedy being agreeable, he took a large dose and fell asleep; and she took that opportunity to make her escape, with her child, into the woods, and kept herself concealed till they were gone.</P>
<P>The other seven garrisons, viz. Burn|ham's, Bickford's, Smith's, Bunker's, Davis's, Jones's, and Woodman's were re|solutely and successfully defended. At Burnham's the gate was left open: The Indians, ten in number, who were ap|pointed to surprize it, were asleep under
<PB N="273" REF="024087_0281_0FC3001B28B96A40">
the bank of the river, at the time that the alarm was given. A man within, who had been kept awake by the tooth-ach, hearing the first gun, roused the people and secured the gate, just as the Indians who were awakened by the same noise were entering. Finding themselves dis|appointed, they ran to Pitman's, a defence|less house, and forced the door at the mo|ment that he had burst away through that end of the house which was next to the garrison, to which he with his family, taking advantage of the shade of some trees, it being moonlight, happily escaped. Still defeated, they attacked the house of John Davis, which, after some resistance, he surrendered on terms; but the terms were violated, and the whole family was either killed or made captives. Thomas Bickford preserved his house in a singular manner. It was situate near the river, and surrounded with a palisade. Being alarmed before the enemy had reached the house, he sent off his family in a boat, and then shutting his gate, betook himself alone to the defence of his fortress. Despising alike the promises and threats by which the Indians would have persuaded him to surrender, he kept up a constant fire at them, changing his dress as often as he
<PB N="274" REF="024087_0282_0FC3001CBAFF2A28">
could, shewing himself with a different cap, hat or coat, and sometimes without either, and giving directions aloud as if he had had a number of men with him. Finding their attempt vain, the enemy withdrew, and left him sole master of the house which he had defended with such admirable address&punc; Smith's, Bunker's, and Davis's garrisons, being seasonably appriz|ed of the danger, were resolutely defended; one Indian was supposed to be killed and another wounded by a shot from Davis's. Jones's garrison was beset before day; Capt. Jones hearing his dogs bark, and imagin|ing wolves might be near, went out to secure some swine and returned unmolested. He then went up into the flankart and sat on the wall. Discerning the flash of a gun, he dropped backward; the ball entered the place from whence he had withdrawn his legs. The enemy from behind a rock kept firing on the house for some time and then quitted it. During these trans|actions the French priest took possession of the meeting-house, and employed himself in writing on the pulpit with chalk; but the house received no damage.</P>
<P>Those parties of the enemy who were on the south side of the river having com|pleted their destructive work, collected in
<PB N="275" REF="024087_0283_0FC300264FA8B678">
a field adjoining to Burnham's garrison, where they insultingly shewed their pri|soners, and derided the people, thinking themselves out of reach of their shot. A young man from the centry-box fired at one who was making some indecent signs of defiance, and wounded him in the heel: Him they placed on a horse and carried away. Both divisions then met at the falls, where they had parted the evening before, and proceeded together to Capt. Wood|man's garrison. The ground being un|even, they approached without danger, and from behind a hill kept up a long and severe fire at the hats and caps which the people within held up on sticks above the walls, without any other damage than galling the roof of the house. At length, apprehending it was time for the people in the neighbouring settlements to be col|lected in pursuit of them, they finally withdrew; having killed and captivated between ninety and an hundred persons, and burned about twenty houses, of which five were garrisons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix with his usual parade boasts of their having killed two hundred and thirty people, and burned fifty or sixty houses&punc; He speaks of only two sorts, both of which were stormed.</NOTE>.

She lived fourteen days on a decoction of the bark of trees. Once they set her to draw a sled up a river against a piercing north-west wind, and left her.

<P>About forty of the enemy under Tox|us, a Norridgwog chief, resolving on far|ther mischief, went westward and did ex|ecution as far as Groton. A small par|ty having crossed the river Pascataqua, came to a farm where Ursula Cutts, wid|ow of the deceased president, resided, who imagining the enemy had done what mischief they intended for that time, could not be persuaded to remove into town till her haymaking should be finished. As she was in the field with her labourers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magnalia, lib. 7. p. 86.</NOTE> the enemy fired from an ambush and killed her, with three others. Colonel Richard

Waldron and his wife with their infant son (afterward secretary) had almost shar|ed the same fate; they were taking boat to go and dine with this lady, when they were stopped by the arrival of some friends at their house; whilst at dinner they were informed of her death. She lived about two miles above the town of Portsmouth, and had laid out her farm with much ele|gance.

On the twenty-sixth of June an attack was made at Portsmouth plain, about two miles from the town. The enemy came from York-nubble to Sandy-beach in canoes, which they hid there among the bushes near the shore. Some suspicion was formed the day before by reason of the cattle running out of the

woods at Little-harbour; but false alarms were frequent and this was not much re|garded. Early in the morning the attack was made on five houses at once; fourteen persons were killed on the spot, one was scalped and left for dead, but recovered, and four were taken. The enemy having plun|dered the houses of what they could carry, set them on fire, and made a precipitate retreat through the great swamp. A com|pany of militia under Captain Shack|ford and Lieutenant Libbey pursued, and discovered them cooking their breakfast, at a place ever since called Breakfast hill. [Rye] The Indians were on the farther side, having pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ced their captives between them|selves and the top of the hill, that in case of an attack they might first receive the fire. The lieutenant pleaded to go round the hill, and come upon them below to cut off their retreat; but the captain fear|ing that in that case they would, accord|ing to their custom, kill the prisoners, rushed upon them from the top of the hill, by which means they retook the captives and plunder, but the Indians, rolling down the hill, escaped into the swamp and got to their canoes. Another party, under anoth|er commander, Gerrish, was then sent out in shallops to intercept them as they should

cross over to the eastward by night. The captain ranged his boats in a line, and or|dered his men to reserve their fire till he gave the watch-word. It being a calm night the Indians were heard as they ad|vanced; but the captain, unhappily giving the word before they had come within gun-shot, they tacked about to the south|ward, and going round the Isles of Shoals, by the favour of their light canoes escaped. The watch-word was Crambo, which the captain ever after bore as an appendage to his title<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The account of this transaction I had from the late Judge Parker, who had taken pains to preserve it.

<P>The next year on the tenth of June,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1697.</NOTE> the town of Exeter was remarkably pre|served from destruction. A body of the enemy had placed themselves near the town, intending to make an assault in the morning of the next day. A number of women and children contrary to the advice of their friends went into the fields, with|out a guard, to gather strawberries. When
<PB N="280" REF="024087_0288_0FC3003D6E8F0D58">
they were gone, some persons, to frighten them, fired an alarm; which quickly spread through the town, and brought the people together in arms. The Indians supposing that they were discovered, and quickened by fear, after killing one, wounding ano|ther, and taking a child, made a hasty re|treat and were seen no more there. But on the fourth day of July they waylaid and killed the worthy Major Frost at Kit|tery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mag. lib. 7. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 91. MS Journal.</NOTE> to whom they had owed revenge ever since the seizure of the four hundred at Cochecho, in which he was concerned.</P>
<P>The same year an invasion of the coun|try was projected by the French. A fleet was to sail from France to Newfoundland and thence to Penobscot, where being join|ed by an army from Canada, an attempt was to be made on Boston, and the sea|coast ravaged from thence to Pascataqua. The plan was too extensive and compli|cated to be executed in one summer. The fleet came no further than Newfoundland; when the advanced season, and scantiness of provisions obliged them to give over the design. The people of New-England were apprized of the danger, and made the best preparations in their powe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

the frontiers against the Indians who were expected to co-operate with the French. Some mischief was done by lurking parties at the eastward&punc; but New-Hampshire was unmolested by them during the remainder of this, and the whole of the following year.</P>
<P>After the peace of Ryswick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1698.</NOTE> Count Frontenac informed the Indians that he could not any longer support them in a war with the English, with whom his na|tion was then at peace.

Januar. 7.</NOTE> where they ratified their former engagements; acknowledged subjection to the crown of England; lamented their former perfidy, and promised future peace and good behaviour in such terms as the commissioners dictated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mag. lib. 7 p. 94.</NOTE> and with as much sincerity as could be expected. At the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame time they restored those captives who were able to travel from the places of their detention to Casco in that unfavourable season of the year; giving assurance for the return of the others in the spring; but many of the younger sort, both males and
<PB N="282" REF="024087_0290_0FC30042F2C67578">
females, were detained; who, mingling with the Indians, contributed to a succes|sion of enemies in future wars against their own country.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. vol. 2. p. 110.</NOTE></P>
<P>A general view of an Indian war will give a just idea of these distressing times, and be a proper close to this narration.</P>
<P>The Indians were seldom or never seen before they did execution. They appear|ed not in the open field, nor gave proofs of a truly masculine courage; but did their exploits by surprize, chiefly in the morn|ing, keeping themselves hid behind logs and bushes, near the paths in the woods, or the fences contiguous to the doors of houses; and their lurking holes could be known only by the report of their guns, which was indeed but feeble, as they were sparing of ammunition, and as near as possible to their object before they fired. They rarely assaulted an house unless they knew there would be but little resistance, and it has been afterward known that they have lain in ambush for days together, watching the motions of the people at their work, without daring to discover themselves. One of their chiefs who had got a woman's riding-hood among his plunder would put it on, in an evening, and walk into the streets of Portsmouth,
<PB N="283" REF="024087_0291_0FC3004491935420">
looking into the windows of houses and listening to the conversation of the people.</P>
<P>Their cruelty was chiefly exercised upon children, and such aged, infirm, or cor|pulent persons as could not bear the hard|ships of a journey through the wilderness. If they took a woman far advanced in pregnancy their knives were plunged into her bowels. An infant when it became troublesome had its brains dashed out a|gainst the next tree or stone. Sometimes to torment the wretched mother, they would whip and beat the child till almost dead, or hold it under water till its breath was just gone, and then throw it to her to comfort and quiet it. If the mother could not readily still its weeping, the hatchet was buried in its skull. A captive weari|ed with a burden laid on his shoulders was often sent to rest the same way. If any one proved refractory, or was known to have been instrumental of the death of an Indian, or related to one who had been so, he was tortured with a lingering punish|ment, generally at the stake, whilst the other captives were insulted with the sight of his miseries. Sometimes a fire would be kindled and a threatening given out against one or more, though there was no intention of sacrificing them, only to make
<PB N="284" REF="024087_0292_0FC3004E80B22D48">
sport of their terrors. The young Indians often signalized their cruelty in treat|ing captives inhumanly out of sight of the elder, and when inquiry was made into the matter, the insulted captive must either be silent or put the best face on it, to pre|vent worse treatment for the future. If a captive appeared sad and dejected he was sure to meet with insult; but if he could sing and dance and laugh with his masters, he was caressed as a brother. They had a strong aversion to negroes, and&punc; generally killed them when they fell into their hands.</P>
<P>Famine was a common attendant on these doleful captivities; the Indians when they caught any game devoured it all at one sitting, and then girding themselves round the waist, travelled without susten|ance till chance threw more in their way. The captives, unused to such canine re|pasts and abstinances, could not support the surfeit of the one nor the craving of the other. A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hange of masters, though it sometimes proved a relief from misery, yet rendered the prospect of a return to their home more distant. If an Indian had lost a relative, a prisoner bought for a gun, a hatchet, or a few skins, must supply the place of the deceased, and be the father, brother, or son of the purchaser; and those
<PB N="285" REF="024087_0293_0FC30050B2F7C290">
who could accommodate themselves to such barbarous adoption, were treated with the same kindness as the persons in whose place they were substituted. A sale among the French of Canada was the most hap|py event to a captive, especially if he be|came a servant in a family; though some|times even there a prison was their lot, till opportunity presented for their redemp|tion; whilst the priests employed every se|ducing art to pervert them to the popish religion, and induce them to abandon their country. These circumstances, joined with the more obvious hardships of travelling half naked and barefoot through pathless desarts, over craggy mountains and deep swamps, through frost, rain and snow, exposed by day and night to the inclemency of the weather, and in summer to the ven|omous stings of those numberless insects with which the woods abound; the rest|less anxiety of mind, the retrospect of past scenes of pleasure, the remembrance of distant friends, the bereavements experi|enced at the beginning or during the pro|gress of the captivity, and the daily ap|prehension of death either by famine or the savage enemy; these were the horrors of an Indian captivity.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="024087_0294_0FC30052B544A860">On the other hand, it must be acknow|ledged that there have been instances of justice, generosity and tenderness during these wars, which would have done honor to a civilized people. A kindness shewn to an Indian was remembered as long as an injury; and persons have had their lives spared for acts of humanity done to the ancestors of those Indians into whose hands they have fallen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Several instances to this purpose have been occasionally men|tioned in the course of this narrative.

When sick or wounded they would afford them proper means for their recovery, which they were very well able to do by their knowledge of simples.

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. The civil affairs of the province during the administrations of Usher, Partridge, Allen, the Earl of Bellamount and Dudley, comprehending the whole controversy with Allen and his heirs.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN Usher, Esquire, was a native of Boston, and by profession a stationer. He was possessed of an handsome fortune, and sustained a fair character in trade. He had been employed by the Massachusetts government, when in England, to nego|ciate the purchase of the province of Maine, from the heirs of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, and had thereby got a taste for speculating in landed interest. He was one of the partners in the million purchase, and had sanguine expectations of gain from that quarter. He had rendered himself unpop|ular among his countrymen, by accepting the office of treasurer, under Sir Edmund Androsse, and joining with apparent zeal in the measures of that administration, and he continued a friendly connexion with that party, after they were displaced.</P>
<P>Though not illnatured, but rather of an open and generous disposition, yet he
<PB N="289" REF="024087_0297_0FC30062731B4080">
wanted those accomplishments which he might have acquired by a learned and polite education. He had but little of the states|man, and less of the courtier. Instead of an engaging affability he affected a severi|ty in his deportment, was loud in conver|sation, and stern in command. Fond of presiding in government, he frequently journied into the province, (though his residence was at Boston, where he carried on his business as usual,) and often sum|moned the council when he had little or nothing to lay before them. He gave or|ders, and found fault like one who felt himself independent, and was determined to be obeyed. He had an high idea of his authority and the dignity of his com|mission, and when opposed and insulted, as he sometimes was, he treated the of|fenders with a severity which he would not relax till he had brought them to sub|mission. His public speeches were al|ways incorrect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> files.</NOTE> and sometimes coarse and reproachful.</P>
<P>He seems, however, to have taken as much care for the interest and preservation of the province as one in his circumstanc|es could have done. He began his ad|ministration in the height of a war which greatly distressed and impoverished the
<PB N="290" REF="024087_0298_0FC2FB31012E6228">
country, yet his views from the beginning were lucrative<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a letter to George Dorrington and John Taylor in London, he writes thus;
<Q>Jan. 29, 1692-3. In case yourselves are concern|ed in the province of New-Hampshire, with prudent manage|ment it may be worth money, the people only paying 4d and 2d per acre. The reason why the commonalty of the people do not agree is because 3 or 4 of the great landed men dissuade them from it. The people have petitioned the king to be an|nexed to Boston government, but it will not be for the proprie|tor's interest to admit of that unless the king sends a general governor over all.</Q></NOTE>. The people perceived these views, and were aware of the danger. The transfer of the title from Mason to Allen was only a change of names: They expected a repetition of the same difficul|ties under a new claimant. After the op|position they had hitherto made, it could not be thought strange that men whose pulse beat high for freedom, should refuse to submit to vassalage; nor, whilst they were on one side defending their possessions against a savage enemy, could it be ex|pected, that on the other, they should tamely suffer the intrusion of a landlord. Usher's interest was united with theirs in providing for the defence of the country, and contending with the enemy; but when the propriety of the soil was in ques|tion, they stood on opposite sides; and as both these controversies were carried on at the same time, the conduct of the peo|ple toward him varied according to the
<PB N="291" REF="024087_0299_0FC2FB3689F5CE00">
exigency of the case; they sometimes vot|ed him thanks for his services, and at other times complained of his abusing and op|pressing them.</P>
<P>Some of them would have been content to have held their estates under Allen's title<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>I have 40 hands in Exeter who desire to take patents fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lands from you, and many in other towns.</Q>
<BIBL>Usher to All<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&punc; October 1695.</BIBL></NOTE>, but the greater part, including the principal men were resolved to oppose it to the last extremity. They had an aver|sion not only to the proprietary claim on their lands, but their separation from the Massachusetts government, under which they had formerly enjoyed so much free|dom and peace. They had petitioned to be re-annexed to them, at the time of the revolution; and they were always very fond of applying to them for help in their difficulties, that it might appear how un|able they were to subsist alone. They knew also that the Massachusetts people were as averse as themselves to Allen's claim, which extended to a great part of their lands, and was particularly noticed in their new charter.</P>
<P>Soon after Usher's arrival, he made en|quiry for the papers which contained the transactions relative to Mason's suits. Du|ring the suspension of government in 1689,
<PB N="292" REF="024087_0300_0FC2FB3774440CF8">
Captain John Pickering, a man of a rough and adventurous spirit, and a lawyer, had gone with a company of armed men to the house of Chamberlayne, the late secre|tary and clerk, and demanded the records and files which were in his possession. Chamberlayne refused to deliver them without some legal warrant or security; but Pickering took them by force, and conveyed them over the river to Kittery. Pickering was summoned before the gov|ernor, threatened and imprisoned, but for sometime would neither deliver the books, nor discover the place of their conceal|ment, unless by order of the assembly and to some person by them appointed to re|ceive them. At length, however, he was constrained to deliver them, and they were put into the hands of the secretary, by the lieutenant-governor's order.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1693.</NOTE>Another favourite point with Usher was to have the boundary between New-Hampshire and Massachusetts ascertained: There were reasons which induced some of the people to fall in with this desire. The general idea was, that New-Hampshire began at the end of three miles north of the river Merrimack; which imaginary line was also the boundary of the adjoin|ing townships on each side. The people
<PB N="293" REF="024087_0301_0FC2FB38EE796E30">
who lived, and owned lands near these li|mits, pretended to belong to either pro|vince, as best suited their conveniency; which caused a difficulty in the collecting of taxes, and cutting of timber. The town of Hampton was sensibly affected with these difficulties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1695. October 12&punc;</NOTE> and petitioned the council that the line might be run. The council ap|pointed a committee of Hampton men to do it, and gave notice to Massachusetts of their intention;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. files.</NOTE> desiring them to join in the affair. They disliked it and declin|ed to act. Upon which the lieutenant-governor and council of New-Hampshire caused the boundary line to be run from the sea-shore three miles northward of Merrimack, and parallel to the river,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brief of the case of N. Hamp. and Massachu. stated by Strange &amp; Hollings, 1738, p. 3.</NOTE> as far as any settlements had been made, or lands occupied.</P>
<P>The only attempt made to extend the settlement of the lands during these times, was, that in the spring of the year 1694, whilst there was a truce with the Indians, Usher granted a charter for the township of Kingston, to about twenty petitioners from Hampton. They were soon dis|couraged by the dangers and difficulties of the succeeding hostilities, and many of them returned home within two years. After the war they resumed their enter|prize;
<PB N="294" REF="024087_0302_0FC2FB3A80128A18">
but it was not till the year 1725, that they were able to obtain the settlement of a minister. No alterations took place in the old towns, except the separa|tion of Great Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1693.</NOTE> Little Harbour, and Sandy Beach, from Portsmouth, and their erection into a town by the name of New-castle; together with the annexation of that part of Squamscot patent which now bears the name of Stretham, to Exeter, it having before been connected with Hampton.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. files.</NOTE></P>
<P>The lieutenant-governor was very for|ward in these transactions, thinking them circumstances favourable to his views, and being willing to recommend himself to the people, by seconding their wishes, as far as was consistent with the interest he meaned to serve. The people, however, regarded the settling and dividing of townships, and the running of lines, only as matters of general convenience, and continued to be disgusted with his administration. His re|peated calls upon them for money were answered by repeated pleas of poverty, and requests for assistance from the neigh|bouring province. Usher used all his in|fluence with that government to obtain a supply of men to garrison the frontiers; and when they wanted provisions for the
<PB N="295" REF="024087_0303_0FC2FB4792A1FD30">
garrisons, and could not readily raise the money, he would advance it out of his own purse and wait till the treasury could reimburse it.</P>
<P>During the two or three first years of his administration the public charges were provided for as they had been before, by an excise on wines and other spirituous liquors, and an impost on merchandise. These duties being laid only from year to year, Usher vehemently urged upon the assembly a renewal of the act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1695. Nov. 7 and 9.</NOTE> and an ex|tension of the duty to articles of export; and that a part of the money so raised might be applied to the support of govern|ment. The answer he obtained was, that
<Q>considering the exposed state of the prov|ince, they were obliged to apply all the money they could raise to their defence; and therefore they were not capable of doing any thing for the support of gov|ernment, though they were sensible his honour had been at considerable ex|pence: They begged that he would join with the council in representing to the king the poverty and danger of the prov|ince, that such methods might be taken for their support and preservation as to the royal wisdom should seem meet.</Q>
Being further pressed upon the subject,
<PB N="296" REF="024087_0304_0FC2FB496F97CAC8">
they passed a vote to lay the proposed du|ties for one year,
<Q>provided he and the council would join with them in peti|tioning the king to annex them to Mas|sachusetts.</Q></P>
<P>He had the mortification of being disap|pointed in his expectations of gain, not only from the people, but from his employer. Allen had promised him two hundred and fifty pounds per annum for executing his commission; and when at the end of the third year, Usher drew on him for the payment of this sum, his bill came back protested <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is probable that Allen was not able to comply with this demand. The purchase of the province from the Masons had been made "with other men's money." <BIBL>Letter of Usher to Sir Matthew Dudley, Sept. 1718.</BIBL></NOTE>. This was the more mortify|ing, as he had assiduously and faithfully attended to Allen's interest, and acquaint|ed him from time to time with the means he had used, the difficulties he had en|countered, the pleas he had urged, the time he had spent, and the expence he had incurred in defence and support of his claim. He now desired him to come over and assume the government himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Usher's let|ter to Al|len, July and Octo. 1695.</NOTE> or get a successor to him appointed in the of|fice of lieutenant-governor. He did not know that the people were before hand of him in this latter request.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="024087_0305_0FC2FB4CE755BB90">On a pretence of disloyalty he had re|moved Hinckes, Waldron, and Vaughan from their seats in the council. The form|er of these was a man who could change with the times; the two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tter were steady opposers of the proprietary claim. Their suspension irritated the people, who, by their influence, privately agreed to recom|mend William Partridge, Esq. as a prop|er person for their lieutenant governor in Usher's stead. Partridge was a native of Portsmouth, a shipwright, of an extra|ordinary mechanical genius, of a politic turn of mind, and a popular man. He was treasurer of the province, and had been ill used by Usher. Being largely concerned in trade he was well known in England, having supplied the navy with masts and timber. His sudden departure for England was very surprising to Usher, who could not imagine he had any other business than to settle his accounts. But the surprise was greatly increased when he returned with a commission appointing him lieutenant-governor and commander in chief in Allen's absence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1697.

<P><PB N="298" REF="024087_0306_0FC2FB53781168A8">Immediately on his arrival, his appoint|ment was publickly notified to the people; though, either from the delay of making out his instructions, or for want of the form of an oath necessary to be taken, the commission was not published in the usu|al manner: But the party in opposition to Usher triumphed. The suspended counsellors resumed their seats, Pickering was made king's attorney, and Hinckes as president of the council, opened the as|sembly with a speech.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 8.</NOTE> This assembly or|dered the records which had been taken from Pickering to be deposited in the hands of Major Vaughan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS.

<P>Usher being at Boston when this altera|tion took place, wrote to them, declaring that no commission could supersede his till duly published; and intimated his inten|tion of coming hither
<Q>if he could be safe with his life.</Q>
He also dispatched his secretary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Febru. 20.</NOTE> Charles Story, to England, with an account of this transaction, which in one of his private letters he styles "the Pascataqua rebellion;" adding, that
<Q>the militia were raised, and forty horse sent to seize him;</Q>
and intimating that the
<PB N="299" REF="024087_0307_0FC2FB56D7DCCB90">
confusion was so great, that
<Q>if but three French ships were to appear, he believ|ed they would surrender on the first summons.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Usher's Letters.</NOTE></Q>
The extreme imprudence of sending such a letter across the Atlan|tic in time of war, was still heightened by an apprehension which then prevailed, that the French were preparing an armament to invade the country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lt Gov. Stough|ton's letter of Feb. 24, in files.</NOTE> and that
<Q>they particularly designed for Pascataqua river.</Q></P>
<P>In answer to his complaint, the lords of trade directed him to continue in the place of lieutenant-governor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">August 3.</NOTE> till Partridge should qualify himself, or till Richard, Earl of Bellomont, should arrive; who was com|missioned to the government of New-York, Massachusetts Bay and New-Hampshire; but had not yet departed from England. Usher received the letter from the lords together with the articles of peace which had been concluded at Ryswick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Decem. 10.</NOTE> and im|mediately set off for New-Hampshire, (where he had not been for a year) pro|claimed the peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Decem. 13</NOTE> and published the or|ders he had received, and having proceed|ed thus far,
<Q>thought all well and quiet.</Q>
But his opposers having held a consulta|tion at night, Partridge's commission was the next day published in form;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Decem. 14.</NOTE> he took
<PB N="300" REF="024087_0308_0FC2FB57A97D1030">
the oaths, and entered on the administra|tion of government, to he complete vex|ation and disappointment of Usher who had been so elated with the confirmation of his commission,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Usher's pa.</NOTE> that as he passed through Hampton, he had forbidden the minister of that place to observe a thanksgiving day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">les.</NOTE> which had been appointed by President Hinckes.</P>
<P>An assembly being called, one of their first acts was to write to the lords of trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1698. January 3.</NOTE>
<Q>acknowledging the favour of the king in appointing one of their own inhabi|tants to the command of the province, complaining of Usher, and alleging that there had been no disturbances but what he himself had made; declaring that those counsellors whom he had suspend|ed were loyal subjects, and capable of serving the king; and informing their lordships that Partridge had now quali|fied himself, and that they were waiting the arrival of the Earl of Bellomont.</Q></P>
<P>They also deputed I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">habod Plaisted to wait on the earl at New-York, and com|pliment him on his arrival.
<Q>If he should find his lordship high, and reserved, and not easy of access, he was instructed to employ some gentleman who was in his confidence to manage the business; but
<PB N="301" REF="024087_0309_0FC2FB5EAD24A7E8">
if easy and free, he was to wait on him in person; to tell him how joyfully they received the news of his appointment, and that they daily expected Governor Allen, whose commission would be ac|counted good till his lordship's should be published,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plaisted's Instructi|ons in files.</NOTE> and to ask his advice how they should behave in such a case.</Q>
The prin|cipal design of this message was to make their court to the earl, and get the start of Usher or any of his friends who might prepossess him with an opinion to their disadvantage. But if this should have hap|pened, Plaisted was directed
<Q>to observe what reception they met with. If his lordship was ready to come this way, he was to beg leave to attend him as far as Boston, and then ask his permission to return home;</Q>
and he was furnished with a letter of credit to defray his expenses. This message, which shews the contrivers to be no mean politicians, had the desired effect.</P>
<P>The earl continued at New-York for the first year after his arrival in America; during which time Governor Allen came over, as it was expected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 23.</NOTE> and his com|mission being still in force, he took the oaths and assumed the command.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 15.</NOTE> Upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> appearance<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 23.</NOTE>
<PB N="302" REF="024087_0310_0FC2FB60BA3D4570">
in council, where he produced the letter from the lords of trade, claimed his place as lieutenant-governor, and declared that the suspended counsellors had no right to sit till restored by the king's order. This brought on an altercation, wherein Elliot affirmed that Partridge was duly qualified and in office, that Waldron and Vaughan had been suspended without cause, and that if they were not allowed to sit, the rest were determined to resign. The gover|nor declared Usher to be of the council; upon which Elliot withdrew.</P>
<P>At the succeeding assembly two new counsellors appeared;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1699. January 5.</NOTE> Joseph Smith, and Kingsley Hall. The first day passed quiet|ly. The governor approved Pickering as speaker of the house; told them he had assumed the government because the Earl of Bellomont had not arrived; recommend|ed a continuance of the excise and powder money, and advised them to send a con|gratulatory message to the earl at New-York.<NOTE PLACE="marg">January 6.</NOTE> The next day the house answered, that they had continued the customs and excise till November, that they had already congratulated the earl, and received a kind answer, and were waiting his arrival; <HI>when</HI> they should enter further on business. They complained that Allen's conduct had
<PB N="303" REF="024087_0311_0FC2FB66B3009078">
being grievous in forbidding the collecting of the last tax, whereby the public debts were not paid; in displacing sundry fit persons, and appointing others less fit, and admitting Usher to be of the council, though superseded by Partridge's commis|sion. These things they told him had ob|liged some members of the council and assembly to apply to his lordship for re|lief, and
<Q>unless he should manage with a more moderate hand they threatened him with a second application.</Q></P>
<P>The same day Coffin and Weare mov|ed a question in council, whether Usher was one of that body. He asserted his privilege, and obtained a major vote. They then entered their dissent, and de|sired a dismission. The governer forbad their departure. Weare answered that he would not, by sitting there, put contempt on the king's commission, meaning Par|tridge's, and withdrew. The next day the assembly ordered the money arising from the impost and excise to be <HI>kept</HI> in the treasury, till the Earl of Bellomont's arrival; and the governor dissolved them.</P>
<P>These violences on his part were sup|posed to originate from Usher's resent|ment, and his overbearing influence upon Allen, who is said to have been rather of a
<PB N="304" REF="024087_0312_0FC2FB68297407B0">
pacific and condescending disposition. The same ill temper continued during the remainder of this short administration. The old counsellers, excepting Fryar, re|fused to sit. Sampson Sheaffe and Peter Weare made up the quorum. Sheaffe was also secretary, Smith treasurer, and William Ardel, sheriff. The constables refused to collect the taxes of the preced|ing year, and the governor was obliged to revoke his orders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS in files.</NOTE> and commission the for|mer constables to do the duty which he had forbidden.</P>
<P>In the spring the earl of Bellomont set out for his eastern governments. The council voted an address, and sent a com|mittee, of which Usher was one, to pre|sent it to him at Boston; and preparations were made for his reception in New-Hamp|shire; where he at length came and pub|lished his commission to the great joy of the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 31.</NOTE> who now saw at the head of the government a nobleman of distinguish|ed figure and polite manners, a firm friend to the revolution, a favourite of King Wil|liam, and one who had no interest in op|pressing them.</P>
<P>During the controversy with Allen, Par|tridge had withdrawn; but upon this change he took his seat as lieutenant-gov|vernor,
<PB N="305" REF="024087_0313_0FC2FB6FDDC82540">
and the displaced counsellors were again called to the board. A petition was presented against the judges of the superior court, and a proclamation was issued, for justices of the peace and consta|bles only, to continue in office, whereby the judges commissions determined. Rich|ard Jose was made sheriff in the room of Ardell, and Charles Story secretary in the room of Sheaffe.</P>
<P>The government was now modelled in favour of the people, and they rejoiced in the change, as they apprehended the way was opened for an effectual settlement of their long continued difficulties and dis|putes. Both parties laid their complaints before the governor, who wisely avoided censuring either, and advised to a revival of the courts of justice, in which the main controversy might be legally decided. This was agreed to, and the necessary acts be|ing passed by an assembly, (who also pre|sented the earl with five hundred pounds which he obtained the king's leave to ac|cept) after about eighteen days stay he quitted the province, leaving Partridge, now quietly seated in the chair, to appoint the judges of the respective courts. Hinckes was made chief justice of the superior court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Records.</NOTE> with Peter Coffin, John Gerrish and John
<PB N="306" REF="024087_0314_0FC2FB74B8301050">
Plaisted for assistants; Waldron chief jus|stice of the inferior court, with Henry Dow, Theodore Atkinson and John Wood|man for assistants.</P>
<P>One principal object of the earl's atten|tion was to fortify the harbour and pro|vide for the defence of the country in case of another war. He had recommended to the assembly in his speech the building of a strong fort on Great Island, and after|ward, in his letters, assured them that if they would provide materials, he would endeavour to prevail on the king to be at the expense of erecting it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1700. June 6.</NOTE> Col. Romer, a Dutch engineer, having viewed the spot, produced to the assembly an estimate of the cost and transportation of materials, amounting to above six thousand pounds. They were amazed at the proposal; and returned for answer to the governor, that in their greatest difficulties, when their lives and estates were in the most immi|nent hazard, they were never able to raise one thousand pounds in a year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I have here placed in one view such assessments as I have been able to find during the preceding wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, with the proportion of each town, which varied according to their respective circumstances at different times.

No evidence appeared of his having obtained possession. The work was to begin anew; and Waldron, being one of the principal landholders and most strenuous opposers of the claim, was singled out to stand fore|most in the controversy with Allen, as his father had with Mason. The cause went through the courts, and was invariably given in favour of the defendant with costs. Allen's only refuge was in an appeal to the king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 13.</NOTE> which the court, following the example of their brethren in the Massa|chusetts, refused to admit. He then pe|titioned the king, who by an order in council granted him an appeal, allowing

him eight months to prepare for its pro|secution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1701. April 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>The refusal of an appeal could not fail of being highly resented in England. It was severely animadverted on by the lords of trade, who in a letter to the Earl of Bellomont upon this occasion, say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 29.</NOTE>
<Q>This declining to admit appeals to his majesty in council, is a matter that you ought very carefully to watch against in all your governments. It is an humour that prevails so much in proprieties and charter colonies, and the INDEPEN|DENCY they thirst after is now so noto|rious, that it has been thought fit those considerations, together with other ob|jections against those colonies, should be laid before the parliament; and a bill has thereupon been brought into the house of lords for re-uniting the right of government in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to the crown.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS in file<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Before this letter was written the earl died at New-York,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 5.</NOTE> to the great regret of the people in his several governments, among whom he had made himself very popular. A copy of the letter was sent to New-Hampshire by the council of New-York; but the bill mentioned in it was not passed into an act of parliament. For some reasons
<PB N="310" REF="024087_0318_0FC2FB7EAE0FE690">
of state it was rejected by the house of lords.</P>
<P>The assembly of New-Hampshire, hav|ing now a fair opportunity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch. vol. 2. p. 131.</NOTE> endeavoured as much as possible to provide for their own security; and passed two acts, the one for confirming the grants of lands which had been made within their several town|ships;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 13.</NOTE> the other for ascertaining the bounds of them. Partridge gave his consent to these acts; but Allen had the address to get them disallowed and repealed be|cause there was no reserve made in them of the proprietor's right.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Laws.</NOTE></P>
<P>The controversy being carried before the king, both sides prepared to attend the suit. Allen's age, and probably want of cash, prevented his going in person; he therefore appointed Usher to act for him, having previously mortgaged one half of the province to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Octob. 14.</NOTE> for fifteen hundred pounds; Vaughan was appointed agent for the province,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1702. May 29.</NOTE> and attorney to Waldron. It being a general interest, the assembly bore the expence, and notwithstanding their pleas of poverty on other occasions provided a fund, on which the agent might draw in case of emergency.</P>
<P>In the mean time King William died and Queen Anne appointed Joseph Dudley Esq. formerly president of New-England,
<PB N="311" REF="024087_0319_0FC2FB81D047A9E0">
to be governor of Massachusetts and New-Hampshire; whose commission being pub|lished at Portsmouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 13.18.</NOTE> the assembly by a well timed present interested him in their favour, and afterward settled a salary on him during his administration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council &amp; Assembly Records.</NOTE> agreeably to the queen's instructions, who about this time forbad her governors to receive any but settled salaries.</P>
<P>When Allen's appeal came before the queen in council, it was found that his attorney had not brought proof that Ma|son had ever been legally in possession;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Printed state of Allen's ti|tle, p. 9.</NOTE> for want of this, the judgment reco|vered by Waldron was affirmed; but the order of council directed that the appellant
<Q>should be at liberty to begin <HI>de novo</HI> by a writ of ejectment in the courts of New-Hampshire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Copy of Lords Trade Re|port in 1753.</NOTE> to try his title to the lands, or to quit-rents pay|able for the same; and that if any doubt in law should arise, the jury should de|clare what titles each party did severally make out to the lands in question, and that the points in law should be referred to the court;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Files of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Sup. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> or if any doubt should arise concerning the evidence, it should be specially stated in writing, that if either party should appeal to her majesty she might be more fully informed, in order to a final determination.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="024087_0320_0FC2FB87B21E3728">Whilst this appeal was depending a pe|tition was presented to the queen, pray|ing that Allen might be put in possession of the waste lands. This petition was re|ferred to Sir Edward Northey attorney ge|neral, who was ordered to report on three questions. viz. 1. Whether Allen had a right to the wastes? 2. What lands ought to be accounted waste? 3. By what meth|od her majesty might put him into pos|session? At the same time Usher was mak|ing interest to be re-appointed lieutenant-governor of the province. Upon this, Vaughan entered a complaint to the queen, setting forth
<Q>that Allen claimed as waste ground not only a large tract of unoc|cupied land, but much of that which had been long enjoyed by the inhabitants, as common pasture, within the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ounds of their several townships. That Usher, by his former managements and misdemean|ours when in office, had forced some of the principal inhabitants to quit the pro|vince, and had greatly harrassed and dis|gusted all the rest, rendering himself quite unacceptable to them. That he was in|terested in the suits now depending, as on Allen's death he would in right of his wife be entitled to part of the estate. Wherefore it was humbly submitted whe|ther
<PB N="313" REF="024087_0321_0FC2FB892D7E2DE0">
it would be proper to appoint, as lieutenant-governor, one whose interest and endeavour it would be to disseize the people of their ancient estates, and render them uneasy; and it was prayed that no letters might be written to put Allen in possession of the wastes till the petitioner should be heard by council.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Usher's papers.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Usher's interest however prevailed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1703. January 28.</NOTE> The attorney general reported, that
<Q>Allen's claim to the wastes was valid; that all lands <HI>uninclosed and unoccupied</HI> were to be reputed waste; that he might enter into and take possession of them, and if disturbed might assert his right and pro|secute trespassers in the courts there; but that it would not be proper for her maje|sty to interpose, unless the question should come before her by appeal from those courts; save, that it might be reasonable to direct (if Allen should insist on it at the trials) that matters of fact be found specially by the juries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Superior Court files.</NOTE> and that these spe|cial matters should be made to appear on an appeal.</Q></P>
<P>Soon after this Usher obtained a second commission as lieutenant-governor; but was expressly restricted from intermedling
<Q>with the appointment of judges or juries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 26.</NOTE> or otherwise, in matters relating to the
<PB N="314" REF="024087_0322_0FC2FB91F05C5B18">
disputes between Allen and the inhabit|ants.</Q>
The people did not relish this re-appointment, nor did his subsequent conduct reconcile them to it. Upon his first appearance in council Partridge took his seat as counsellor;<NOTE PLACE="marg">October 27.</NOTE> but the next day desired a dismission on account of a ship in the river which demanded his constant attention. This request was granted, and he soon after removed to Newbury, where he spent the rest of his days in a mercan|tile department, and in the business of his profession.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His son Richard Partridge was an agent for the province in England. One of his daughter, was married to Governor Belcher, and was mother to the late lieutenant-governor of Nova-Scotia.</NOTE></P>
<P>It had always been a favourite point with Usher to get the books and files, which had been taken from Chamberlayne, lodged in the secretary's office. Among these files were the original minutes of the suits which Mason had carried on, and the verdicts, judgments and bills of cost he had recovered. As they were committed to the care of the recorder who was appoint|ed by the general court and removeable only by them, no use could be made of these papers but by consent of the assembly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 4.</NOTE> When Usher produced to the council an order from Whitehall that these records
<PB N="115" REF="024087_0323_0FC2FB92F2D4AE18">
should be deposited with the secretary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1704.</NOTE> Penhallow, the recorder, who was a mem|ber of the council, refused to deliver them without an act of the general assembly authorizing him to do so.</P>
<P>Usher succeeded but little better in his applications for money. He alleged that he had received nothing for his former services, though they had given hundreds to Partridge; and he complained that no house was provided for him to reside in, which obliged him to spend most of his time at Boston. The plea of poverty al|ways at hand, was not forgotten in an|swer to these demands. But at length, upon his repeated importunity and Dud|ley's earnest recommendation, after the assembly had refused making any provision for him, and the governor had expressly directed him to reside at New-Castle, and exercise a regular command,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 7.</NOTE> it being a time of war; the council were prevailed upon to allow him two rooms in any house he could procure
<Q>till the next meeting of the assembly,</Q>
and to order <HI>thirty eight shillings</HI> to be given him for the expence of his
<Q>journey to and from Boston.</Q></P>
<P>When Dudley acquainted the assembly with the royal determination in Allen's suits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 10.</NOTE> they appeared tolerably satisfied
<PB N="316" REF="024087_0324_0FC2FB96AA894458">
with the equitable intention discovered therein; but begged him to represent to her majesty that
<Q>the province was at least sixty miles long and twenty wide, containing twelve hundred square miles, that the inhabitants claimed only the property of the lands contained within the bounds of their townships, which was less than one third of the province, and had been possessed by them and their ancestors more than sixty years; that they had nothing to offer as a grievance if the other two thirds were adjudged to Allen; but should be glad to see the same planted and settled for the better security and defence of the whole; with|al desiring it might be considered how much time, blood and treasure had been spent in settling and defending this part of her majesty's dominion, and that the cost and labour bestowed thereon far exceeded the true value of the land; so that they hoped it was not her majesty's intention to deprive them of all the herb|age, timber and fuel, without which they could not subsist; and that the lands com|prehended within the bounds of their townships was little enough to afford these necessary articles;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he council and assem|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly.</NOTE> it not being usual in these plantations to fence in

<P>Notwithstanding this plea, which was often alleged, Allen, by virtue of the queen's permission,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 22, 1703.</NOTE> had entered upon and taken possession, by turf and twig, of the common land in each township, as well as of that which was without their bounds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Usher's pa.</NOTE> He brought his writ of ejectment <HI>de novo</HI> against Waldron, and when the trial was coming on, informed Governor Dudley of it, that he might come into court and demand a special verdict agreeably to the queen's instructions.

It has been said that he made very advantageous offers to Vaughan and Waldron, if they would purchase his title; but that they utterly refused it. The peo|ple were sensible that a door was still open for litigation; and that after Allen's death they might, perhaps, meet with as much or more difficulty from his heirs, among whom Usher would probably have a great influence. They well knew his indefati|gable industry in the pursuit of gain, that he was able to harrass them in law, and had great interest in England.

That in case Allen would, for himself and heirs, for|ever quit claim, to the present inhabitants and their heirs, all that tract of land com|prehended within the bounds of the seve|ral towns, and warrant and defend the same against all persons, free of mort|gage, entailment and every other incum|brance, and that this agreement should be accepted and confirmed by the queen&punc; then they would lot and lay out to him and his heirs five hundred acres within the town of Portsmouth and New-Castle, fifteen hundred in Dover, fifteen hundred in Hampton and Kingston, and fifteen hundred in Exeter, out of the common|ages

of the said towns, in such places, not exceeding three divisions in each town, as should best accommodate him and be least detrimental to them; and that they would pay him or his heirs two thousand pounds current money of New-England at two payments, one within a year after receiving the royal confirma|tion of this agreement, and the other within a year after the first payment. That all contracts made either by Mason or Allen with any of the inhabitants, or others, for lands or other privileges in the possession of their tenants in their own just right, beside the claim of Mason and Allen, and no other, should be ac|counted valid; but that if any of the pur|chasers, lessees or tenants should refuse to pay their just part of the sums agreed on, according to the lands they held, their share should be abated by Allen out of the two thousand pounds payable by this agreement.

<P>On Allen's part were produced copies of the charter by which King James I. con|stituted the council of Plymouth; their grants to Mason in 1629 and 1635; his last will and testament; an inventory of artillery, arms, ammunition, provisions, merchandize and cattle left in the care of his agents here at his death; depositions of several ancient persons taken in 1685, who remembered the houses, fields, forts, and other possessions of Capt.

Mason's title; King Charles's letter to the president and council of New-Hampshire in 1680; the paragraph of Cranfield's commission which respects Mason's claim in 1682; the writ, verdict, judgment and execution against Major Waldron in 1683; the decision of the king in council against Vaughan in 1686; Dudley's writ of <HI>cer|tiorari</HI> in 1688; the fine and recovery in Westminster-hall whereby the entail was cut off, and the consequent deed of sale to Allen in 1691; Sir Edward Northey's re|port in 1703; and evidence of Allen's taking possession of the wastes, and of his inclosing and occupying some land at Great Island. On this evidence, it was pleaded that the title derived from Mason, and his possession of the province, of which the lands in question were part, was legal; that the appellee's possession had been in|terrupted by the appellant and those from whom he derived his title, more especially by the judgment recovered by Robert Ma|son against Major Waldron; and a special verdict was moved for, agreeably to the royal directions. The council on this side were James Meinzies and John Valentine.</P>
<P>On Waldron's part were produced the deed from four Indian sachems to Whele|wright and others in 1629; and deposi|tions
<PB N="324" REF="024087_0332_0FC2FBB362D61740">
taken from several ancient persons who testified that they had lived with Ma|jor Waldron when he began his planta|tion at Cochecho, about the year 1640, and assisted him in building his houses and mills, and that no person had disturbed him in the possession thereof for above forty years. To invalidate the evidence of the title produced on the opposite side, it was pleaded, That the grant from the council of Plymouth to Mason in 1629, was not signed; that livery and feizin were not endorsed on it as on other of their grants, and as was then the legal form; nor was it ever enrolled according to statute: That the sale of part of the same lands in 1628 to the Massachusetts company, by an instrument signed and executed according to law, renders this subsequent grant suspicious; and that his pretending to procure another grant of part of the same lands in 1635, was an argu|ment that he himself could not rely on the preceding one, nor was it credible that the same council should grant the same lands twice, and to the same person: That the grant in 1635 was equally defective; and that he must reliquish one or the other, it being contrary to the reason and usage of law to rely on two several titles at once.
<PB N="325" REF="024087_0333_0FC2FBBD1CA4CB50">
It was urged, That Waldron's possess|ion was grounded on a deed from the native lords of the soil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1703.</NOTE> with whom his father had endeavoured to cultivate a friendly connexion; that he had tak|en up his land with their consent, when the country was a wilderness; had cul|tivated it, had defended it in war at a great expense, and at the hazard of his life, which he finally lost in the attempt; that the Indian deed was legally executed in the presence of the factors and agents of the company of Laconia, of which Ma|son was one; that this was done with the toleration of the council of Plymouth, and in pursuance of the great ends of their incorporation, which were to cultivate the lands, to people the country and christian|ize the natives, for the honour and interest of the crown and the trade of England, all which ends had been pursued and at|tained by the appellee and his ancestor. It was also alleged, that the writ against Major Waldron in 1683 was for "lands and tenements," of which the quantity, situation and bounds were not described, for want of which no legal judgment could be given; that no execution had ever been levied, nor was the possessor ever disturbed or amoved by reason thereof; and that
<PB N="326" REF="024087_0334_0FC2FBBEE6394740">
the copies produced were not attested,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1707.</NOTE> no book of records being to be found. To invalidate the evidence of Mason's posses|sion, it was observed, that he himself was never here in person; that all the settle|ment made by his agents or successors was only a factory for trade with the Indians, and principally for the discovery of a coun|try called Laconia; and that this was done in company with several other merchant-adventurers in London, who, for the secu|rity of their goods erected a fort; but that this could not amount to a legal possession nor prove a title to the country, especially as upon the failure of trade, the object of their enterprize, they quitted their factory after a few years stay in these parts.</P>
<P>As to the motion for a special verdict, it was said that a jury could not find one, if they had no doubt of the law or fact, for the reason of a special verdict is a doubt either in point of law or evidence; nor was it consistent with the privileges of English|men that a jury should be <HI>compelled</HI> to find specially. In addition to these pleas, it was further alleged, that by the statute law no action of ejectment can be main|tained except the plaintiff, or those under whom he claims, have been in possession within twenty years; and if they have
<PB N="327" REF="024087_0335_0FC2FBC31342E880">
been out of possession sixty years, then not only an ejectment, but a writ of right, and all other real actions are barred in re|spect of a subject, and that in such cases the right of the crown is also barred: and that by the statute of 32 Hen. 8. ch. 9. it is enacted, that no person shall purchase any lands or tenements, unless the seller, or they by whom he claims, have been in possession of the same or the reversion or remainder thereof, or have taken the rents or profits thereof by the space of one whole year next before such bargain is made; and that the appellee and his an|cestor, and no other person whatever had been in possession of the premises, nor was it ever pretended by the appellant that the Masons, of whom the purchase was made, were in possession within one year, or at any time before the alleged purchase; that all the mischiefs provided against by the above statute have been experienced by the people of New-Hampshire from the purchase made by the appellant's fa|ther, of the bare title of the propriety of the province. The council on this side were John Pickering and Charles Story.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. The war with the French and Indians, called Queen Anne's war. Conclusion of Dudley's and Usher's administration.</HEAD>
<P>THE peace which followed the treaty of Ryswick was but of short duration, for the seeds of war were already sown both in Europe and America. Louis had proclaim|ed the pretender king of England, and his Governor Villebon had orders to extend his province of Acadia to the river Kennebeck, though the English court understood St. Croix to be the boundary between their territories and those of the French. The fishery was interrupted by French men of war, and by the orders of Villebon, who suffered no English vessels to fish on the banks of Nova-Scotia. A French mission was established, and a chapel erected at Norridgwog, on the upper part of Kenne|beck, which served to extend the influence of the French among the Indians. The governor of Canada, assuming the cha|racter of their father and protector, in|stigated them to prevent the settlement of the English to the east of Kennebeck, and found some among them ready to listen
<PB N="330" REF="024087_0338_0FC2FBCBF08C7780">
to his advice. The people in those parts were apprehensive of danger and meditat|ed a removal, and those who had enter|tained thoughts of settling there were re|strained.</P>
<P>Things were in this posture when Dud|ley entered on his government. He had particular orders from England to rebuild the fort at Pemaquid; but could not pre|vail on the Massachusetts assembly to bear the expence of it. However he determin|ed on a visit to the eastern country, and having notified his intention to the Indians, took with him a number of gentlemen of both his provinces<NOTE PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> this transaction by a year.</NOTE>, and held a conference at Casco with delegates from the tribes of Norridgwog,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1703. June 20.</NOTE> Penobscot, Pigwacket, Pena|cook and Amariscoggin; who assured him that
<Q>as high as the sun was above the earth, so far distant was their design of making the least breach of the peace.</Q>
They pre|sented him a belt of wampum in token of their sincerity, and both parties went to two heaps of stones which had formerly been pitched and called the <HI>Two Brothers,</HI> where the friendship was further ratified by the addition of other stones. They al|so declared, that although the French emis|saries among them had been endeavouring
<PB N="331" REF="024087_0339_0FC2FBD66EAFDFB0">
to break the union, yet it was
<Q>firm as a mountain, and should continue as long as the sun and moon.</Q>
Notwithstand|ing these fair appearances, it was observed that when the Indians fired a salute their guns were charged with shot; and it was suspected that they had then formed a de|sign to seize the governor and his atten|dants, if a party which they expected from Canada, and which arrived two or three days after, had come in proper season to their assistance. However this might be, it is certain that in the space of six weeks, a body of French and Indians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">August 10</NOTE> five hundred in number, having divided themselves into several parties, attacked all the settlements from Casco to Wells, and killed and took one hundred and thirty people, burning and destroying all before them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hutchinson takes no notice of this remarkable devastation, which is particularly related by Mr Penhallow in his "wars of New-England." p. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>The next week (August 17) a party of thirty Indians under Capt. Tom killed five people at Hampton village; among whom was a widow Mussy, a noted speak|er among the friends, and much lamented by them; they, also plundered two houses; but the people being alarmed, and pursu|ing them, they fled.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="024087_0340_0FC2FBDBE68298C8"><NOTE PLACE="marg">703.</NOTE>The country was now in terror and confusion. The women and children re|tired to the garrisons. The men went armed to their work, and posted centinels in the fields. Troops of horse were quar|tered at Portsmouth and in the province of Maine. A scout of three hundred and sixty men marched toward Pigwacket, and another to Ossapy Ponds; but made no discoveries. Alarms were frequent, and the whole frontier country from Deer|field on the west, to Casco on the east was kept in continual terror by small parties of the enemy.</P>
<P>In the fall Col. March of Casco made a visit to Pigwacket, where he killed six of the enemy and took six more; this encou|raged the government to offer a bounty of forty pounds for scalps.</P>
<P>As the winter came on, the frontier towns were ordered to provide a large num|ber of snow-shoes; and an expedition was planned in New-Hampshire, against the head quarters of the Indians. Major Winthrop Hilton, and Captain John Gil|man of Exeter, Captain Chesley and Cap|tain Davis of Oyster river, marched with their companies on snow-shoes into the woods; but returned without success. This is called in the council books "an honour|able

<P>With the return of spring there was a return of hostilities;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1704.</NOTE> for notwithstanding the posting a few southern Indians in the garrisons at Berwick, the enemy appeared at Oyster river,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 25.</NOTE> and shot Nathaniel Me|dar near his own field, and the next day killed Edward Taylor near Lamprey river, and captivated his wife and son. These instances of mischief gave colour to a false alarm at Cochecho, where it was said they lay in wait for Col. Waldron a whole day, but missing him by reason of his absence from home, took his servant maid as she went to a spring for water; and hav|ing examined her as to the state of the garrison, stunned her with an hatchet but did not scalp her. The girl invented this story to palliate her too long absence.</P>
<P>In May Col. Church, by Governor Dud|ley's order, having planned an expedition to the eastern shore, sailed from Boston with a number of transports, furnished with whale-boats for going up rivers. In his way he stopt at Pascataqua, where he was joined by a body of men under Major Hilton, who was of eminent service to him in this expedition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is called in the council books "an expedition to Port-Royal," and this was the ostensible object. But Church in his memoirs says that Dudley would not permit him to go there. <BIBL>Church, p. 104. Hutch. II. 146.</BIBL></NOTE>, which lasted the
<PB N="334" REF="024087_0342_0FC2FBE2E38A28E8">
whole summer, and in which they destroy|ed the towns of Minas and Chiegnecto, and did considerable damage to the French and Indians at Penobscot and Passaquod|dy, and even insulted Port-Royal. Whilst they were at Mount Desart, Church learn|ed from nine of his prisoners that a body of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I suppose this is the party whom Penhallow mentions, p 23. who quarrelled on their march about dividing the plunder which they might take, and of whom two hundred returned while the rest pursued their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> did damage at Lancaster and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> six hundred Indians were preparing for an attack on Casco, and the head of Pascataqua river; and sent an express to Portsmouth which obliged the people to be vigilant. No such great force as this appeared; but small parties kept hovering on the out skirts. At Oyster river they wounded William Tasker; and at Dover they laid in Ambush for the people on their return from public worship, but hap|pily missed their aim. They afterward mortally wounded Mark Gyles at that place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">August 11.</NOTE> and soon after killed several people in a field at Oyster river, whose names are not mentioned.</P>
<P>In the former wars New-Hampshire had received much assistance from their
<PB N="335" REF="024087_0343_0FC2FBE4252C9A00">
brethern of Massachusetts; but these now remonstrated to the governor that his other province did not bear their proportion of the charge for the common defence. The representatives of New-Hampshire urged, in reply, the different circumstances of the two provinces;
<Q>most of the towns in Massachusetts be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng out of the reach of the enemy, and no otherwise affected by the war than in the payment of their part of the expence, whilst this province was wholly a frontier by sea and land, and in equal danger with the county of York, in which four companies were stationed, and the inhabitants were abated their pro|portion of the public charges.</Q>
They beg|ged that twenty of the friendly Indians might be sent to scout on their borders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Rec.</NOTE> which request the governor complied with.</P>
<P>In the winter, Col. Hilton with two hundred and seventy men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1705.</NOTE> including the twenty Indians, were sent to Norridgwog on snow-shoes. They had a favourable season for their march, the snow being four feet deep. When they arrived there, finding no enemy to contend with, they burnt the deserted wigwams, and the cha|pel. The officers who went on this ex|pedition complained that they had only the pay of private soldiers.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="024087_0344_0FC2FBED53DEB738">The late repairs of fort William and Mary at New-Castle were always com|plained of, as burdensome to the people; and a representation thereof had been made to the queen, who instructed Dud|ley, to press the assembly of Massachusetts, to contribute to the expence; as the river bolonged equally to both provinces. They urged in excuse, that the fort was built at first, at the sole charge of New-Hampshire, to whom it properly belonged; that the whole expence of the repairs did not a|mount, to what several of their towns singly paid, toward the support of the war for one year; that all the trade and navigation of the river, on both sides, paid a du|ty toward maintaining that fortress; and that they had been at great expence in pro|tecting the frontiers of New-Hampshire, and the parties who were employed in getting timber and masts for her majesty's service; whilst New-Hampshire had never contributed any thing to the support of the garrisons, forces and guards by sea, which were of equal benefit to them as to Massa|chusetts. One thing which made New-Hampshire more in favour with the queen was, that they had settled a salary on her governor, which the others never could be persuaded to do. The repairs of the
<PB N="337" REF="024087_0345_0FC2FBEF6DB4E998">
fort, however, went on without their assistance, under the direction of Col. Romer; and when they were completed, a petition was sent home for a supply of cannon, ammunition and stores.</P>
<P>The next summer was chiefly spent in negotiating an exchange of prisoners; and Dudley had the address to protract the ne|gotiation, under pretence of consulting with the other governments about a neu|trality proposed by the governor of Cana|da; by which means, the frontiers in ge|neral were kept tolerably quiet, although the enemy appeared once or twice in the town of Kittery. The line of pickets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This line extended from the mill-pond on the south, to the creek on the north side of the town. It crossed the main street <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> few rods westward of the spot where the State House now stands.</NOTE> which inclosed the town of Portsmouth was repaired, and a nightly patrole esta|blished on the sea shore, from Rendezvous Point to the bounds of Hampton, to pre|vent any surprize by sea; the coasts being at this time infested by the enemy's pri|vateers.</P>
<P>During this truce, the inhabitants of Kingston who had left the place, were en|couraged to petition for leave to return to their lands which the court granted on condition that they should build a fort in the center of the town, lay out a parson|age
<PB N="338" REF="024087_0346_0FC2FBF42970C7A8">
and settle a minister within three years&punc; This last condition was rendered imprac|ticable by the renewal of hostilities.</P>
<P>The governor of Canada had encourag|ed the Indians who inhabited the borders of New-England to remove to Canada, where being incorporated with the tribe of St. Francis, they have ever since re|mained. By this policy they became more firmly attached to the interest of the French, and were more easily dispatched on their bloody business to the frontiers of New-England, with which they were well ac|quainted. Dudley, who was generally apprized of their movements, and kept a vigilant eye upon them, apprehended a rup|ture in the winter; and gave orders for a cir|cular scouting march, once a month, round the heads of the towns from Kingston to Sal|mon falls; but the enemy did not appear till April;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1706.</NOTE> when a small party of them attacked the house of John Drew at Oyster river, where they killed eight and wound|ed two. The garrison was near, but not a man in it: The women, however, seeing nothing but death before them, fired an alarm, and then putting on hats, and loosening their hair that they might ap|pear like men, they fired so briskly that the enemy, apprehending the people were

alarmed, fled without burning or even plundering the house which they had at|tacked.

<P>In July Colonel Schuyler fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Albany gave notice to Dudley that two hundred and seventy of the enemy were on their march toward Pascataqua, of which he im|mediately informed the people, and or|dered them to close garrison, and one half of the militia to be ready at a minute's warning. The first appearance of this body of the enemy was at Dunstable; whence they p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oceeded to Amesbury and Kingston, where they killed some cat|tle. Hilton with sixty four men march|ed from Exeter; but was obliged to re|turn without meeting the enemy. The reason he gave to the council for return|ing so soon was the want of provision, there being none in readiness at the gar|risons, notwithstanding a law lately enact|ed, enjoining it on every town to have stores ready and deposited in the hands of their captains. For the same reason he had
<PB N="340" REF="024087_0348_0FC2FBF6E0B6DCD8">
been obliged to discontinue a small scout which he had for some time kept up. Hilton was so brave and active an officer that the enemy had marked him for de|struction; and for this purpose a party of them kept lurking about his house, where they observed ten men to go out one morn|ing with their scythes, and lay aside their arms to mow; they then crept between the men and their guns and suddenly rushing on them killed four, wounded one, and took three; two only of the whole number escaped. They missed the major for this time, and two of their prisoners escaped; but suffered much in their re|turn, having nothing to subsist on for three weeks but lilly roots and the rinds of trees. After this they killed William Pearl and took Nathaniel Tibbets at Dover.<NOTE PLACE="marg">August 10.</NOTE> It was observed during this war that the ene|my did more damage in small bodies than in larger, and by scattering along the frontiers kept the people in continual ap|prehension and alarm; and so very few of them fell into our hands, that in comput|ing the expence of the war it was judged that every Indian killed or taken cost the country a thousand pounds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penhallow p. 40.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the following winter Hilton made another excursion to the eastward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1707.</NOTE> and a
<PB N="341" REF="024087_0349_0FC2FC02F1AC4F00">
shallop was sent to Casco with stores and provisions for his party consisting of two hundred and twenty men. The winter being mild, and the weather unsettled, pre|vented their marching so far as they in|tended: Cold dry weather and deep snow being most favourable to winter expedi|tions. However they came on an Indian track near Black Point, and pursuing it, killed four, and took a squaw who con|ducted them to a party of eighteen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 21.</NOTE> whom they surprized as they lay asleep on a neck of land at break of day, and of whom they killed seventeen and took the other. This was matter of triumph considering the dif|ficulty of finding their haunts. It was remarked that on the very morning that this affair happened it was reported with but little variation from the truth, at Ports|mouth though at the distance of sixty miles.</P>
<P>When Church went to Nova-Scotia he very earnestly solicited leave to make an attempt on Port Royal; but Dudley would not consent, and the reason he gave was, that he had written to the ministry in England and expected orders and naval help to reduce the place. His enemies however assigned another reason for his refusal; which was that a clandestine trade was carried on by his connivance, and to his

emolument, with the French there. This report gained credit and occasioned a loud call for justice. Those who were directly concerned in the illegal traffick were pro|secuted and fined;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch. Hist. Massa. Vol. 2. p. 154.</NOTE> and the governor suf|fered much in his reputation. To wipe off these aspersions he now determined to make an attack in earnest, on Port-Royal, even though no assistance should come from England. It was intended that an armament should be sent to America, and the commander was appointed; but the state of affairs in Europe prevented their coming.</P>
<P>Early in the spring the governor appli|ed to the assemblies of both his provinces, and to the colonies of Rhode-Island and Connecticut, requesting them to raise one thousand men for the expedition. Con|necticut declined but the other three rais|ed the whole number, who were disposed into two regiments, of which Colonel Wainwright commanded the one, and Colonel Hilton the other. They embark|ed at Nantasket in twenty-three transports furnished with whaleboats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 13.</NOTE> under convoy of the Deptford man of war, Capt. Stuckley, and the province galley, Capt. Southack. The chief command was given to Colonel March, who had behaved well in several

Some of the officers went to Boston for orders, some of the transports put in at Casco; a sloop with Captain Chesley's company of sixty men arrived at Portsmouth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 13.</NOTE> Chesley suffered his men to disperse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Rec.</NOTE> but ordered them to return at the beat of the drum: Being call|ed to account for this conduct he pleaded that
<Q>general orders were given at Port Royal for every man to make the best of his way home.</Q>
The governor, highly chagrined and very angry, sent orders from Boston that if any more vessels should arrive, the men should not be permit|ted to come on shore "on pain of death." After a while he ordered Chesley's com|pany to be collected and reimbarked, offer|ing a pardon to those who might voluntari|ly return, the rest to be severely punished. By the latter end of July they went on board,
<PB N="344" REF="024087_0352_0FC2FC0741E15E78">
and with the rest of the army, returned to the place of action. At the landing, an ambuscade of Indians from among the sedge on the top of a sea-wall, greatly an|noyed the troops. Major Walton and Captain Chesley, being then on shore with the New-Hampshire companies, pushed their men up the beach, flanked the ene|my, and after an obstinate struggle put them to flight. The command was now given to Wainwright, and the army put under the direction of three supervisors; but no means could inspire that union, firmness and skill which were necessary. By the last of August the whole affair was at an end, and the army returned sickly, fatigued, disheartened, and ashamed; but with no greater loss than sixteen killed and as many wounded.</P>
<P>Whilst this unfortunate expedition was in hand, the frontiers were kept in con|tinual alarm.<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 22.</NOTE> Two men were taken from Oyster river,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 8.</NOTE> and two more killed as they were driving a team between that place and Dover.

The re|maining inhabitants complained to the government, who ordered the captains of Exeter and Hampton to take them up as deserters, and oblige them to return to the defence of their settlements, or do duty at the fort during the governor's pleasure.

<PB N="346" REF="024087_0354_0FC2FC13F25ECE50">
Yet under all these distresses and discouragements, they resolutely kept their ground and maintained their garrisons, not one of which was cut off during the whole of this war, within the limits of New-Hampshire.</P>
<P>In September one man was killed at Exeter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Septem. 15.</NOTE> and two days after Henry Elkins at Kingston.<NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE> But the severest blow on the frontiers happened at Oyster river, a place which suffered more than all the rest. A party of French Mohawks painted red, attacked with an hideous yell a company who were in the woods, some hewing tim|ber and others driving a team, under the direction of Captain Chesley who was just returned the second time from Port Royal. At the first fire they killed seven and mor|tally wounded another. Chesley, with the few who were left, fired on the enemy with great vigour, and for sometime check|ed their ardour; but being overpowered, he at length fell. He was much lamented, being a brave officer. Three of the scalps taken at this time were soon after recov|ered at Berwick.</P>
<P>The next year a large army from Can|ada was destined against the frontiers of New-England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1708.</NOTE> Dudley received infor|mation of it in the usual route from Al|bany,

and immediately ordered guards in the most exposed places of both these pro|vinces. A troop under Captain Rober<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Coffin patroled from Kingston to Coche|cho, and scouts were kept out continually. Spy-boats were also kept out at sea be|tween Pascataqua and Winter harbours. Four hundred Massachusetts soldiers were posted in this province.

At length the storm fell on Haverhill;<NOTE PLACE="marg">August 29.</NOTE> but the enemy's force having been diminished by various accidents, they proceeded no farther, and every part of New-Hampshire was quiet.

<P>The next spring William Moody,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1709.

But the principal object now
<PB N="348" REF="024087_0356_0FC2FC246FD3F138">
in view was a desire of wiping off the dis|grace of a former year, by an attempt, not on Port Royal, but on Canada itself. For this purpose solicitations had been made in England by Francis Nicholson, Esq. who had been lieutenant-governor of Vir|ginia, and Capt. Samuel Vetch a trader to Nova-Scotia, who was well acquainted with the French settlements there, and made a full representation of the state of things in America to the British ministry. An expedition being determined upon, they came over, early in the spring, with the queen's command to the governors of the several provinces, to raise men for the ser|vice. Vetch was appointed a colonel, and Nicholson by nomination of the governor of New-York, and consent of the other governments, was made commander in chief. The people of New-Hampshire were so much exhausted, and their men had been so ill paid before, that it was with great difficulty, and not without the dissolution of one assembly and the calling of another, that they could raise money to levy one hundred men and procure two transports for conveying them. After the utmost exertions had been made by the se|veral governments, and Nicholson with part of the troops had marched to Wood

Upon which the commander of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">igates on the Bos|ton station refused to convoy the troops, the whole army was disbanded, and the expence the colonies had been at was fruit|less. A congress of governors and dele|gates from the assemblies met in the fall at Rhode-Island, who recommended the sending of agents to assist Colonel Ni|cholson in representing the state of the country, and soliciting an expedition against Canada the next spring. The ministry at first seemed to listen to this proposal, but afterward changed their minds, and re|solved only on the reduction of Port Royal.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1710.</NOTE> For this purpose Nicholson came over in July with five frigates and a bomb ketch; the colonies then had to raise their quotas; the New-Hampshire assembly ordered one hundred men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">August 1.</NOTE> who were got ready as soon as possible, and put under the command of Colonel Shadrach Walton. The whole armament sailed from Boston the eigh|teenth of September, and on the twenty-fourth arrived at the place. The force now being equal to its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eduction&punc; Suber|case,

<P>Whilst this expedition was in hand, and before the appointment of the command|ers, New-Hampshire sustained an heavy loss in the death of Col. Winthrop Hilton. This worthy officer being concerned in the masting business,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 22.</NOTE> and having several large trees felled, about fourteen miles from home, went out with a party to peel the bark that the wood might not be injured by worms. Whilst engaged in this business they were ambu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hed by a party of Indians, who at the first fire killed Hilton with two more, and took two; the rest being terri|fied, and their guns being wet, made no opposition, but escaped. The next day one hundred men marched in pursuit, but discovered only the mangled bodies of the dead. The enemy in their barbarous tri|umph had struck their hatchets into the colonel's brains, and left a lance in his heart. He was a gentleman
<Q>of good temper, courage and conduct, respected and lamented by all that knew him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penhallow p. 58.</NOTE></Q>

and was buried with the honours due to his rank and character.</P>
<P>Flushed with this success, they insolent|ly appeared in the open road at Exeter, and took four children who were at their play. They also took John Wedgwood, and killed John Magoon near his brother's barn, a place which for three days he had visited, with a melancholy apprehension, arising from a dream, that he should there be murdered.</P>
<P>The same day that Hilton was killed, a company of Indians who had pretended friendship, who the year before had been peaceably conversant with the inhabitants of Kingston, and seemed to be thirsting after the blood of the enemy, came into the town, and ambushing the road, killed Samuel Winslow, and Samuel Huntoon; they also took Philip Huntoon and Jacob Gilman, and carried them to Canada;<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Letter of Ward Clark to Prince.</NOTE> where, after some time, they purchased their own redemption by building a saw-mill for the governor after the English mode.</P>
<P>The last that fell this summer was Ja|cob Garland, who was killed at Cochecho on his return from the public worship. As the winter approached, Colonel Walton with one hundred and seventy men travers|ed the eastern shores which the Indians
<PB N="352" REF="024087_0360_0FC2FC321F915450">
usually visited at this season for the pur|pose of gathering clams. On an Island where the party was encamped, several Indians decoyed by their smoke, and mis|taking them for some of their own tribe, came among them and were made priso|ners. One of them was a sachem of Nor|ridgwog, active, bold and sullen; when he found himself in the hands of ene|mies he would answer none of their quest|ions, and laughed with scorn at their threatening him with death. His wife, be|ing an eye witness of the execution of the threatening, was so intimidated as to make the discoveries which the captors had in vain desired of the sachem; in conse|quence of which, three were taken at the place of which she informed, and two more at Saco river, where also five were killed. This success, inconsiderable as it may ap|pear, kept up the spirits of the people, and added to the loss of the enemy who were daily diminishing by sickness and famine.</P>

<P>After the reduction of Port Royal Nic|holson went to England to solicit an ex|pedition against Canada. The tory minis|try of Queen Anne, to the surprize of all the whigs in England and America, fell in with the proposal; and on the eighth of June Nicholson came to Boston with orders for the northern colonies to get ready their quotas of men and provision at the arrival of the fleet and army from Europe; which happened within sixteen days; and whilst the several governors were holding a consultation on the subject of their orders. A compliance with them in so short a time was impossible; yet eve|ry thing that could be done was done; the nature of the service conspiring with the wishes of the people, made the gov|ernments exert themselves to the utmost. New-Hampshire raised one hundred men, which was more than they could well spare; one half of the militia being con|tinually

employed in guarding the fron|tiers. They also voted them subsistence for one hundred and twenty-six days, be|sides providing for them on shore before their embarkation. Two transports were taken up at eight shillings per month per ton; and artillery stores were issued from the fort. The colony forces formed two regiments under the command of Vetch and Walton. The army which came from England were seven veteran regiments of the Duke of Marlborough's army, and a battalion of marines, under the command of Brigadier-General Hill, which, joined with the New-England troops made a bo|dy of about six thousand five hundred men, provided with a fine train of artillery. The fleet consisted of fifteen ships of war from eighty to thirty-six guns, with forty transports and six storeships under the com|mand of Admiral Walker.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penhallow p. 64.

success which had been entertained by the nation and the colonies were all blasted in one fatal night. For, the fleet having ad|vanced ten leagues into the river St. Law|rence, in the night of the twenty third of August, the weather being thick and dark, eight transports were wrecked on Egg-Island near the north shore, and one thou|sand people perished; among whom there was but one man who belonged to New-England.

After rendezvousing at Spanish river in the island of Cape Breton, and holding a fruitless consultation about annoying the French at Placentia, the expedition was broken up: the fleet returned to England, and the New-England troops to their homes. Loud complaints and heavy charges were made on this occasion; the ignorance of the pilots; the obstinacy of the admi|ral; the detention of the fleet at Boston; its late arrival there; the want of season|able orders;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dummer's defence and letter to a noble lord.</NOTE> and the secret intentions of the ministry, were all subjects of bitter al|tercation: but the miscarriage was never regularly inquired into,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Octob. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> and the voyage was finally settled by the blowing up of

The frontiers were well guarded; one half of the mili|tia did duty at the garrisons and were ready to march at a minute's warning; a scout of forty men kept ranging on the heads of the towns, and the like care was taken by sea, spy-boats being employed in coasting from Cape Neddock to the Great Boar's-head.

<P>In autumn the news of the peace of Utrecht arrived in America; and on the 29th of October the suspension of arms was proclaimed at Portsmouth.

<P>During the whole of this long war, Usher behaved as a faithful servant of the crown; frequently coming into the province by Dudley's direction, and sometimes resid|ing in it several months, inquiring into the state of the frontiers and garrisons, vis|iting them in person, consulting with the officers of militia about the proper meth|ods of defence and protection, and of|fering his service on all occasions: Yet his austere and ungracious manners, and the interest he had in Allen's claim, effec|tually prevented him from acquiring that popularity which he seems to have deserv|ed. He was solicitous to support the dig|nity of his commission; but could never prevail with the assembly to settle a salary upon him. The council generally paid his travelling expences by a draught on the treasury, which never amounted to more than five pounds for each journey, until he came from Boston to proclaim
<PB N="359" REF="024087_0367_0FC2FC5744C5EC80">
the accession of King George; when in a fit of loyalty and good humour they gave him ten pounds, which served as a pre|cedent for two or three other grants. He often complained, and sometimes in harsh and reproachful terms of their neglect; and once told them that his

<P>Dudley had the good fortune to be more popular. Beside his attention to the gene|ral interest of the province and his care for its defence, he had the particular mer|it of favouring the views of those who were most strongly opposed to Allen's claim; and they made him amends by promoting in the assembly addresses to the queen, defending his character, when it was attacked and praying for his contin|uance in office when petitions were pre|sented for his removal. One of these ad|dresses was in one thousand seven hundred and six, and another in one thousand seven hundred and seven, in both of which they re|present him as a

But it being now a time of peace, and a number of valuable officers who had served with reputation in the late wars being out of employment; inte|rest was made for their obtaining places of profit under the crown. Colonel Eliseus Burges who had served under General Stan|hope was, by his recommendation, com|missioned governor of Massachusetts and New-Hampshire; and by the same inter|est George Vaughan, Esq. then in London, was made lieutenant governor of the latter province; he arrived and published his commission on the thirteenth of October.

Usher had some scruples about the valid|ity of it, as he had formerly had of Par|tridge's, and wrote on the subject to the assembly, who assured him that on inspec|tion they had found Vaughan's commis|sion "strong and authentic;" and that his own was "null and void.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council and As|sembly's Rec.</NOTE>" Upon his dismission from office he retired to his e|legant seat at Medford, where he spent the rest of his days, and died on the fifth of September 1726, in the seventy-eighth year of his age.</P>

<P>RIGHT honourable, right worshippful and the rest&punc; my humble servis rembred. Your letter dated the 5th of December and Mr. Ares letter the third of April I received the seventh of June. The detaining of the former letter hath put you to a great charge in the plan|tation. For my care and paines I have not thought it much although I have had very little encouradgement from you and here. I do not doubt of your good will un|to mee. For your fishing, you complain of Mr. Gibbes: A Londoner is not for fishing, neither is there any amity betwixt the West cuntrimen and them. Bristo or Barn|stable is very convenient for your fishing shipes. It is not enough to fit out shipes to fish but they must be sure (God wil) to be at their fishing place the beginning of February and not to come to the land when other men have half their viage.</P>
<P>Mr. Wanerton hath the charge of the house at Pascat|awa and hath with him William Cooper, Rafe Gee, Rog|er Knight, and his wife, William Dermit and on boy. For your house at Newichwanicke, I seeing the necessity wil doe the best I can there and elsewhere for you until I hear from againe. Advise I have sent but not know|ing your intentes I cannot wel enlarge but I refer you to Mr. Herbert and Mr. Vaughan. For my settlement at Sanders-Point and the further good you intend me I hum|bly thank you I shall do the best I can to be grateful. I have taken into my handes all the trade goods that re|mains of John Raymon's and Mr. Vaughan's and will with what convenience I may put them of. <HI>You complain of your returnes; you take the coorse to have little; a planta|tion must be furnished with cattle and good hir'd hands and necessaries for them and not thinke the great lookes of men and many words wil be a meanes to raise a plantation.</HI> Those that have been here this three year som of them have

For myself, my wife and child and four men we have but half a barrel of corn, beefe and porke I have not had but on peese this three months, nor bear this four months; for I have for two and twenty months had but two barrels of beare and two barrels and four booshel of malt, our number commonly hath bin ten. I nor the servantes have neither money nor clothes, I have bin as sparing as I could, but it will not doe. These four men with me is Charles Knell, Thomas Clarke, Steven Kid|der, and Thomas Crockitt, three of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m is to have for their wages until the first of March four pounds per peese and the other for the yeare six pounds which in your be|half I have promised to satisfy in money or bever at ten shillings per pound. If there were necessarys for them for clothing there would not bee much for them to re|ceave. You may perhaps think that fewer men would serve me but I have sometimes on C [<HI>one hundred</HI>] or more Indians and far from neybors: These that I have I can set to pale in ground for corne and garden. I have digged a wel within the palizado, where is good water, I have that to close with timber. More men I could have and more employ, but I rest thus until I heare from you. <HI>The vines that were planted will com to little, they prosper not in the ground they were set,</HI> them that groo natural are veri good of divers sorts. I have sent you a note of the beav|er taken by me at Newichwanicke, and how it hath gon from me.

<P>THESE people and provisions which I have now sent with Mr. Jocelyne are to sett upp two mills upon my own division of landes lately agreed upon betwixt our adventurers; but I thinke not any of them will adven|ture this yeare to the plantation besides Sr Ferdinando Gorges and myself, for which I am sorrye in that so good a busines (albeit hitherto it hath bene unprofitable) should be subject to fall to the ground. Therefore I have strayn|ed myself to doe this at this present, and could have wished that the rest would have joyned to have sent you some provisions for trade and support of the place, but that faileing I have directed to you as a token from my|selfe one hogshead of mault to make you some beare. The servants with you and such others as remaine upon the companies chardge are to be discharged and payed their wages out of the stocke of beaver in your hands at the rate of 12 s. the pound, whereof I thinke the compa|ny will write you more at large. And wee have agreed to devide all our moveables mentioned in the inventory that Capt. Neale brought home, which were left in trust with you and Mr. Wannerton. I bought Mr. Cotton's and his brother's parte of all their adventures; so that the halfe of all belongs to Sr Ferdinando Gorges and myselfe, and of that halfe three quarters wil be dewe to me and one quarter to Sr Ferdinando. These things being e|qually divided they are to be delivered to Mr. Joceline, my three parts of the halfe, and the other fourth to whom Sr Ferdinando shall appointe. And you must afford my people some house roome in Newichewannocke house, and the cowes and goates which are all mine, and 14 swine with their increase, some ground to be uppon till wee have some place provided upon my new divided land, or that you receive my further order. A copie of the di|vision of the landes is herewith sent unto you.</P>
<P>The stockinges and the mault and the suites of cloathes

and suggar and raysinges and wine that was delivered by Mr. Bright and Mr. Lewes I have not received any sa|tisfaction for, wherein I must crave your helpe and such satisfaction as may be sent by this shipp.</P>
<P><HI>The christall stoanes you sent are of little or no valew unless they were so great to make drinking cuppes or some other workes, as pillers for faire lookeinge glasses or for garnishinge of rich ca|binets. Good iron or lead oare I should like better of if it could be found.</HI></P>

<P>YOUR worship have done well in setting forward your plantacon, and for your milles they will prove bene|ficial unto you, by God's assistance. I would you had taken this coorse sooner, for the merchants I shall be very cautyouse how I deale with any of them while I live. But God's will be done. I and the world doth judge that I could not in these my dayes have spent my time for noethinge. For their sending trade and support I desire it not. I have supported but now sonke under my bur|then, the more I thinke on this, the more is my griefe.</P>
<P>I have received the hogsd. of mault that you sent me, giveing you humble thanks for the same. The servants that were with me are discharged and payd their wages for the yeare past and I have delivered unto Mr. Wannerton 43lb. of beaver to pay those that were with him for the year past. For the paying of the servants there old wa|ges or the dividing of the goods I expect a general letter, if not, then to hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> further from your worshippe.

can. Capt. Neale appoynted me two of your goates to keepe, at his departinge, I praise God they are 4. Of the goods that Mr. Bright left I onely reed. of Capt. Neale 4 bushels of mault and at several times 8 gallons of sacke, and from Mr. Wannerton 7 bushels and one peck of mault, 5lb. and &frac12; of sugar and 3 pr. of children stockings and 97lb of beefe which was of an old cow that Mr. Wannerton killed, being doubtfull that she would not live over the winter. For these I will pay Mr. Jocelin for you.</P>
<P><HI>I percieve you have a great mynd to the lakes, and I as great a will to assist you. If I had</HI> 2 <HI>horses and</HI> 3 <HI>men with me I would by God's helpe soon resolve you of the situation of it, but not to live there myselfe.</HI></P>
<P>The Pide-Cow arrived the eighth of Julie, the 13th day she cast anchor some halfe a mile from the falls, the 18th day the shippe unladen, the 19th fell down the river, the 22d day the carpenters began about the mill, the 5th of August the <HI>iron stoane</HI> taken in the shippe. There is of 3 sorts, on sort that the myne doth cast fourth as the tree doth gum, which is sent in a rundit. On of the other sorts we take to be very rich, there is great store of it. For the other I know not; but may it please you to take notice of the waight and measure of every sort, before it goeth into the furnace and what the stone of such weight and measure will yeeld in iron. This that 'e take to be the best stone is one mile to the southward of the great house<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The great house stood opposite to the house of Mr. Temple Knight.</NOTE>, it is some 200 rodd in length 6 foote wide, the depth we know not, for want of tools for that purpose we tooke onely the surface of the mine.</P>
<P>I have paled in a piece of ground and planted it. If it please God to send us a drie time I hope there will be 8 or 10 quarters of corne. You have heare at the great house 9 cows, 1 bull, 4 calves of the last yeare and 9 of this yeare; they prove very well, farre better than ever was expected, they are as good as your ordinary cattle in England, and the goates prove some of them very well both for milk and breed. If you did send a shippe for the Western Islands of six score tunne or thereabouts for cowes and goates it would be profitable for you. A stocke of iron worke to be put away with your boardes from the mill will be good, nayles, spikes, lockes, hin|ges, iron works for boates and pinaces, twine, canvis,

<OPENER><SALUTE>To the Kinges most excellent Magestie,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACCORDING to your magesties reference upon the petition of Robert Mason, Edward Godfrey, and others, hereunto annexed, bearing date at Whitehall the seventeenth of November 1660, wee have heard the claims and complaints of the peticoners, and also sum|moned by process publi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quely executed at the Exchange on the 21st day of January last against all persons interest|ed in that business, but none appeared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Capt.

<P>Upon producing of divers letters pattents and exami|nacon of witnesses, wee finde, That Capt. Jno. Mason, grandfather to Robert Mason one of the peticoners, and Edward Godfrey another of the peticoners, by virtue of several letters pattents under the great seale of England granted unto them and others by your majesties late roy|al father, by themselves and their assignes have been in actual and quiet possession of several tracts parsells and
<PB N="xviii" REF="024087_0388_0FC2FCBB4992ED80">
divisions of land in New-England, as in and by the said letters patents is particularly expressed, and that the said Capt. Jno. Mason and the said Edward Godfrey did ex|pend and lay outt considerable sums of money in settling plantacons and collonys there; That the said Edward Godfrey has lived there for five and twenty years, hav|ing undergone and discharged the office of governor of the province of Mayne with much reputacon of integrity and justice, endeavouring the regulacon and government of those partes where he lives according to the known and settled lawes of this kingdome; That notwithstand|ing, the said Edward Godfrey has not only been turned out of his said place of governor, butt has been utterly outed and dispossessed of his lands and estate in that country, which the inhabitants of the Massachusetts have forcibly seized and still doe detayne the same from him; That it appears as well by testimony of witnesses as by a coppy of the letters pattents that they were not to act any thing repugnant to the lawes of England, nor to extend their bounds and limits of the said corporacon farther than three miles nortward of Merrymacke river, and as a memorial and evidence thereof, the governor of the Mas|sachusetts did sett up an house about thirty yeares since, which is called <HI>the bound house,</HI> and is knowne by that name to this day, and with this division and assignment or lott of land the inhabitants and pattentees of the said corporacon of the Massachusetts rested content for the space of sixteen years together, until about the year 1652 they did enlarge and stretch their line about threescore miles beyond their known and settled bounds aforesaid; and have thereby not only invaded and incroached upon the plantacons and inheritances of the petitioners and other your majesties subjects, but by menaces and armed forces compelled them to submitt to their usurped and arbitrary government which they have declared to be in|dependent of this your majesties crowne of England, and not subordinate thereunto.</P>
<P>It appears further by the witnesses that the collony of Massachusetts has for these many years past endeavoured to modell and contrive themselves into a free state or commonwealth without any relacon to the crowne of England, assuming on themselves the name and stile of a commonwealth, issuing of writs in their owne name, im|posing
<PB N="xix" REF="024087_0389_0FC2FCBCC7C73600">
of oathes to be true unto themselves contrary to that of allegiance, coyning of money with their owne stamps and signatures, exercising an arbitrary power over the estates and persons of all such as submit not unto their government allowing them noe appeales to England. And some have been soe bold as publiquely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o affirme, that if his majestie should send them a governo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that the severall townes and churches throughout the whole coun|try under their government did resolve to oppose him, and others have said that before they of New-England would or should submitt to any appeale to England they would sell that country or plantacon to the king of Spaine.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide. Huth. Collec. Pap. p 339,</NOTE></P>
<P>That by reason of the premises the said Rob.

But by what pretence of right or au|thority the Massachusetts have taken uppon them to pro|ceede and act in such manner doth not appeare to us.</P>
<P>All which we most humbly represent to your majestie in duty and obedience to your commands, not presuming to offer any opinion in a business of soe high importance, wherein the publique interest and government of your majestie appears soe much intermixt and concerned with the private interest of the peticoners.</P>

<HEAD>No. XIII. To the King's most excellent Majesty. The humble petition of Robert Mason, proprietor of the province of New-Hampshire, in New-England, Sheweth.</HEAD>
<P>THAT your majesty's royal grandfather king James, of ever blessed memory, did by his highness letters patents under the great seale of England, bearing date at Westminster the third day of November, in the eighteenth yeare of his reigne, give, grant and confirm unto several of the principal nobility and gentry of this kingdome by
<PB N="xx" REF="024087_0390_0FC2FCBE5D3CECA0">
the name of the council of New-England, their successors and assignes forever, all the land in America lying between the degrees of 40 and 48 north latitude, by the name of New-England, to be held in fee, with many royal privi|leges and immunities, only paying to his majesty, his heirs and successors, one fift part of all the oare of gold and silver that should at any time be found upon said lands, as by the said letters patents doth at large appeare.</P>
<P>That John Mason, esq. your petitioner's grandfather, by virtue of several grants from the said councell of New-England, under theire common seale, bearing date the 9th of March 1621, the 10th of August 1622, the 7th of November 1629, and the 22d of April 1635, was instated in fee in a great tract of land in New-England by the name of New-Hampshire, lyeing upon the sea-coast be|tween the rivers of Naumkeek and Pasca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">away, and runn|ing up into the land westward threescore miles, with all the islands lying within five leagues distance of any part thereof, and also the south halte of the Isles of Shoals; and also the said John Mason together with Sir Ferdinan|do Gorges, knt. was enfeoffed by the aforesaid councell of New-England in other lands by the name of Laconia by their deed bearing date the 27th day of November, 1629, the said lands lyeing and bordering upon the great lakes and rivers of the Iroquois and other nations adjoining. All which said lands to be held as fully, freely, in as large, ample and beneficial manner and forme to all intents and purposes whatsoever as the said councell of New-Eng|land by virtue of his majesty's said letters patents might or ought to hold and enjoye the same, as by the said sev|eral grants appeares.</P>
<P>Whereupon your petitioner's said grandfather did ex|pend upwards of twenty two thousand pounds in trans|porting people, building houses, forts, and magazines, furnishing them with great store of armes of all sorts, with artillery great and small, for defence and protection of his servants and tenants, with all other necessary commodi|ties and materialls for establishing a settled plantation.</P>
<P>That in the year 1628, in the fourth year of the reigne of your majesty's royal father, some persons did surreptiti|ously and <HI>unknown to the said councell,</HI> get the seale of the said councell affixed to a grant of certaine lands, where|of the greatest part were solemnly past unto your peti|tioner's grandfather and others long before, and soone af|ter
<PB N="xxi" REF="024087_0391_0FC2FCCB4E42C990" MS="y">
did the same persons <HI>by their subtil practises</HI> get a confir|mation of the said grant under the great seale of England, as a corporation by the name of THE CORPORA|TION OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY IN NEW-ENGLAND, <HI>your majesty's royal father being un|witting thereof,</HI> and having thus <HI>by fraud</HI> obteyned a grant and confirmation, they compelled the rightfull inhabitants to desert their plantations, and by many outragious ac|tions they became possessed of that part of the country, declareing themselves to be a free people, frameing to themselves new lawes, with new methods in religion ab|solutely contrary to the lawes and customes of this your majesty's realme of England, punishing diverse that would not approve thereof, some by whipping, others by burn|ing their houses, and some by banishing, and the like.</P>
<P>At last the complaints of the oppressed subjects reach|ing the eares of your royal father, his magesty caused the whole matter to be examined before his most honoura|ble privy councell and all being fully proved, his majesty did command the councell of New-England to give an account by what authority, or by whose procurement those people of the Massachusetts Bay were sent over, his majesty concieving the said councell to be guilty thereof.</P>
<P>But the said councell of New-England made it plainley to appear to his majesty that they were ignorant of the whole matter and that they had noe share in the evils committed and wholly disclaimed the same, and the said councell finding they had not sufficient means to give re|dress and rectify what was bro't to ruine, they humbly re|ferred to his majesty to doe therein as he pleased and there|upon the said councell of New-England resolved to re|sign, and did actually resigne the great charter of New-England into his majesty's royal handes, seeing there was an absolute necessity for his majesty to take the manage|ment of that country to himself, it being become a busi|ness of high consequence and only to be remedied by his sovereign power, all which appears by the declaration of the councell of New-England dated the 25th of April, 1635, together with the act of surrender of the great charter of New-England dated the 7th day of June the same year.</P>
<P>That immediately thereupon, his majesty in trinity terme 1635, caused a quo warranto to be brought up by Sir John Banks his majesty's then attorney general against
<PB N="xxii" REF="024087_0392_0FC2FCCC7633FA00">
the governor, deputy governor and every of the assistants of the said corporation of Massachusetts in New-England severally, according to their names mentioned in the said patents of incorporation, being twenty six persons, where|of two being dead, of the remayning twenty four persons, there did fourteen at several times appeare at the king's bench bar and there disclaimed the charter, the remaining tenn persons were outlawed, and thereupon judgment giv|en for the king, that the liberties and franchises of the said corporation of Massachusetts Bay should be seized into the king's handes and the body of the governor to be taken in|to custody for usurping the said liberties, all which appears by the roles in the crown office, of custos brevium for the king's bench of the proceedings in the several terms from the yeare 1635 to 1637.</P>
<P>That thereupon his said royall majesty on the 3d day of May 1637, did order in councell that the attorney genl. be required to call for the said patent and present the same to the board, and his majesty by his declaration of the 23d of July 1637, in the 13th yeare of his reigne declared his royal pleasure for establishing a generall government in his territory of New-England for the prevention of the evils that otherwise might ensue for default thereof, there|by declaring Sr Ferdinando Gorges to be governor gene|rall of the whole country and requiring all persons to give theire obediance accordingly.</P>
<P>That the warrs and troubles immediately ensueing in Scotland and presently after here in England did hinder his said majesty from settling that country or prosecuting the right which he intended his subjects, however the pro|ceedings of his majesty caused some restraint to the fur|ther violences and oppressions of the said Massachusetts, and they conteyned themselves for a time within their pretended bounds but noe sooner was that king of blessed memory your royal farther become a sacrifice but they re|newed theire former violences by oppressing all the other colonies and designing by encouragement from some in England to erect themselves into a commonwealth, and in order to lay a foundation for this power and dominion which they now aspired unto they thought it necessary to extend theire bounds and spread into a larger territory then as yet they had usurped, and that this work might not be done without a mask or color of right they do in
<PB N="xxiii" REF="024087_0393_0FC2FCD425CDA878">
an assembly held at Boston the 19th of October 1652, se|riously peruse the grant (which had been procured as a|foresd.) and therein weighing the words and trying what new sence they might beare more suteable to theire in|crease of power, they tho't fit at length to declare them|selves mistaken in what they had done in the year 1631, when they erected bound houses and had for soe many yeares confined themselves thereunto, whereas now by the help of an imaginary line or rather by a new reason of state there is <HI>a sence imposed by themselves upon theire own words,</HI> and they stretch their rights to neer two hundred miles of land northward and as much southward more than they were satisfied withal before, swallowing up your majesty's petitioner as well as others whose properties were established long before the said people had any being. And that they might give execution to this righteous sen|tence they presently invade and <HI>by force of arms seize up|on the province of New-Hampshire,</HI> and other lands of right belonging to your petitioner, besides what they did to others, compelling the inhabitants to swear to be true to them and to cast off their lawful lords, and such as refused were either ruined, banished or imprisoned, and any appeales to England utterly denied unto them, then they proceed to coining of money with their owne im|press, raising the coine of England, and acting in all mat|ters, in a most absolute and arbitrary way. And although your petitioner by his agent Joseph Mason did demand redress of the general court of Massachusetts setting at Boston in 1652, offering to make out the right and title of your petitioner to the province of New-Hampshire and other lands against all persons whatsoever, yet noe resti|tution could be obtayned without a submission to their authority, and to hold the lands from them which the petitioner then did refuse and hath alwaies refused chus|ing rather to wait for more happy times wherein to ex|pect reliefe then by a legall resignation of his rights to those who had none at all divest himself of what his an|cestors had purchased at soe deare a rate: Your petition|er having as equall a <HI>right to the government</HI> in the sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> province as he hath to the land itself, all which appears by a report made to your majesty the 15th of February 1661, when your petitioner first exposed to your majesty the
<PB N="xxiv" REF="024087_0394_0FC2FCD6465A7318">
oppressions under which he had so long groaned, in the evil times, and which grieves him now much more to beare while hee has the protection of soe just and gracious a sov|eraigne to resort unto.</P>
<P>Wherefore your petitioner most humbly implores your majesty to take notice, that (by a plaine discovery of what fraud in the beginning and the length of troubled times has helped to conceale) the Bostoners have noe patent of incorporation at all, that yet they have under colour of right and authority from the crown devoured your peti|tioner and other proprietors whose titles are by your ma|jesty's learned councell allowed as strong as the law can make them.</P>
<P>That all waies have been tryed and methods used to obteyn justice from the Bostoners, but all have proved in|effectuall, that your petitioner's losses have been soe many and great, and his sufferings soe continued that he cannot any longer support the burthen of them. And when your majesty will but consider how small the respect has been wherewith those people have treated your majesty since your happy restauration, and what daily breaches are by them made upon your majes|ty's acts of navigation, which turnes so greatly to the de|triment of this kingdome in generall, these losses and suf|ferings of a particular subject cannot much be questioned, soe that your petitioner humbly hopes that your majesty will think it high time to stretch forth your royall hand of justice to assist your petitioner, that hee may have the quiet possession of his province, and reparation made him for the losses susteyned, in such ways and methods as the importance of the case requires, and your majesty in your royall wisdome shall thinke most fitt.</P>

<HEAD>No. XIV. A brief declaration of the right and claim of the governour and company of the Massachusetts Bay in New-Eng|land, to the lands now in their possession, but pretend|ed to by Mr. Gorge and Mr. Mason, together with an answer to their several pleas and complaints in their petitions exhibited: Humbly presented and submitted by the said governour and company to the king's most excellent majesty, as their defence.</HEAD>
<P>IN the yeare of our Lord 1628, in the third yeare of his late majesty Charles the first, of happy memory, sev|eral loyal and piously disposed gentlemen obtained of the great council of New-England, a grant of a certain tract of land lying in New-England, described and bounded as therein expressed; which was in all respects fairly and openly procured and with so good an intent of propagat|ing the gospel among the natives, and to advance the honour and dignity of his late majesty, of happy memo|ry, that they were bold to supplicate his said majesty to superadd his royal confirmation thereto, which according|ly in an ample royal charter was passed and remains un|der the broad seal of England, March the 4th 1629, in the fourth year of his majesties reign, with further addi|tions and enlargments well becoming so royal a majesty and suitable for the encouragement of so hazardous and chargeable an adventure. In pursuance whereof many of the said patentees and other adventurers transported themselves and estates and settled in the most known and accommodable parts of those lands contained in the said charter, neither time, estate, nor power suffering them speedily to survey the just extent of their limits. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> many years different in time several others also of his majesty's subjects obtained other grants&punc; and made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> settlements in the more northern and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">sterne parts of the country, with whom for several year<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> we had neigh|bourly correspondence, being <HI>as they supposed</HI> without the limits of our patent, amongst whom the present claim|ers and petitioners were. These grants partly by reason of the smallness of some of them, and partly by reason of darke involv'd and dubious expression of their limits, brought the inhabitants under many intanglements and dissatisfactions among themselves, which there being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> settled authority to be applied to, being de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed and for|saken

of all such as by virtue of said grants did claim ju|risdiction over them and had made a successless essay for the settlement of government among them proved of some continuance, unto the great disquiet and distur|bance of those his majesty's subjects that were peaceable and well disposed amongst them; to remedy which in|convenience they betook themselves to the way of com|binations for government, but by experience found it in|effectual. In this time ignorance of the northerly runn|ing of Merrimack river hindred our actual claim and ex|tention of government, yet at length being more fully set|tled, and having obtained further acquaintance and cor|respondency with the Indians possessing the uppermost parts of that river encouraging an adventure, as also fre|quent sollicitations from the most considerable inhabitants of those eastern parts earnestly desiring us to make proofe of and ascertain our interest, we imployed the most ap|proved a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ists that could be obtained, who upon their so|lemn oaths made returns, That upon their certain ob|servation our northern patent line did extend so far north as to take in all those towns and places which we now possess; which when the inhabitants as well as our selves were satisfied in (urged also with the necessity of govern|ment amongst them) they peaceably and voluntarily sub|mitted to the government of the Massachusetts, (viz.) Dover, Squamscot and Portsmouth anno 1641, Kittery, York and Wells anno 1652 and 1653, from which times until the year 1662, when there was a small interruption by a letter of Mr. Gorge, and afterwards in the year 1665, (when his majestyes commissioners, Colonel Nichols and others came over) the inhabitants of those parts lived well satisfied and uninterrupted under the Massachusets gov|ernment. But then the said commissioners neither re|garding the Massachusets just right nor the claims of Mr. Gorge and Mr. Mason, settled a new forme of govern|ment there, but this hardly outlived their departure, the people impatient of innovations, and well experienced and satisfied in their former settlement, quickly and quietly returned to order againe and so continue unto his time. This is in a few words the true state of the matter; for the further illustration whereof and justification of our proceedings therein and vindication of ourselves from the reproachful imputation of usurping authority over his
<PB N="xxvii" REF="024087_0397_0FC2FCE39D4A8130">
majesties subjects in the easterne parts pretended to, with other scandals cast upon us by the petitioners, we hum|bly present the following pleas by way of demonstration, and argue that our extension of government to those east|ern parts claimed is agreeable to our indubitable patent right; our patent according to the express terme therein contained without any ambiguity or colour of other in|terpretation, lyes <HI>between two east and west parallel lines drawn from the most southerly part of Charles river and the most northerly part of Merrimack, with three miles advantage upon each,</HI> which upon the observation of men of approv|ed and undoubted truth upon oath, are found distant one degree and forty nine minutes north latitude, being to extend in full latitude and breadth from sea to sea (ut in terminis) and therefore cannot be bounded by many hundreds or infinite numbers of lines, as the river of Mer|rimack maketh bends or angles in two hundred miles passage from Winipesioke lake to the mouth thereof, which to imagine, as it is irrational so would it involve us and any borderer into so many inextricable disputes as are by no wayes to be admitted by a prince seeking his subjects peace. Besides were such a construction allow|able (which with uttermost streining is) yet all favourable interpretation is to be offered the patentees by the gra|cious expression of the charter. Now according to the afore mentioned observation (so confirmed) all those east|ern plantations challenged by our opponents (ut supra) are comprehended within our northerly line. We deny not but the artists of their selves, and if any question thence arise we feare not to submit to tryal to the most exact and rigorous test that may be. The invincible strength of this our first plea may further appear by the consideration of the frivolous and insignificant allegations of the peti|tioners in opposition thereunto, viz. 1st. The nonexten|tion of our line or assertion of our right to those eastern parts for some years, ignorance as our case was circum|stanced debarring no man of his just right, neither can it reasonably be supposed that the exact survey of so large a grant in so hideous a wilderness possessed by an enemy would be the worke of a few years, our own poverty not affording means, and our weakness (allowing no deep adventure into the country) permitting us not view the favourable running of the river, which none can imagine
<PB N="xxviii" REF="024087_0398_0FC2F7C51B51F520">
altered its course by our delay; we may as well be de|prived of far more then we possess or ever saw on our western parts to the south sea (which none will deny) be|cause we have not surveyed it or are soon like to be able, as be taken from our northern right so obvious to the meanest artist.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Possession house in Hampton, of so little sig|nification and so long since disused, that Mr. Mason hath forgot the name thereof and calleth it Bound-house, e|rected to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ive the world to know that we claimed consi|derably to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he northward of our then habitations upon the bay, though we did not know the uttermost extent of our r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ht, our fathers not being so ignorant of the law of the realme to which they did appertain as to suppose the tak|ing possession of part did debar them of the remainder but the contrary; and we challange Mr. Mason or any on his behalfe, promising our records shall be open to the most scrutinous search to prove it, either called or intended ac|cording to his abuse thereof.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. That notorious falshood of stretching our right to near four hundred miles north and south more than formerly we were satisfied with, our whole breadth being but one hundred and nine mile, which is not much more then a quarter part of what he would have the world be|lieve our new claime and (as he would insinuate) usurped territory doth contain, arising (we would charitably believe) partly from ignorance of the coasting of the country, Mr. Mason accounting by the sea-side, and we suppose coast|ing in the measure of every harbour and cove to make up that calculation, which lies much of it due east and not to the north, but we fear malevolently suggested (as many other things as of little credit) to introduce in|to his majestie his royal breast a beliefe that we are un|reasonable in our pretentions, and so unworthy of his ma|jesties favour, which we hope such unlawful endeavours will never be so prosperous as to obtain. What may be further added to this our first plea, may be supplied from the reasons formerly presented. We urge secondly, The invalidity of those grants pretended to by the petitioners, which are of two sorts; 1st. Such as beare date after ours, which we see no reason to feare any interruption from. Secondly, Such as are pretended to bear date before ours, against which we object that they are not authentick,
<PB N="xxix" REF="024087_0399_0FC2F7C63A6981A8">
wanting a sufficient number of grantors to make them so, none of them as we presume will appeare upon tryal having above six hands and seals annexed to them, the said council of New-England consisting of forty, and his ma|jestys grant to them expressly requiring (as we are in|formed) seven at the least to signe to make any validact; and indeed Mr. Mason's own often unwearied renewal of his grants in 1621, sixteen hundred twenty two, sixteen hundred twenty nine and 1635, (as he saith) tacitly con|fesseth the same invalidity, in the former puting him to charge for the latter, till at last he fell into such a trade of obtaining grants that his last and most considerable was six years after the grant of our charter from his majesty, and but three days before the said council's declaration of their absolute resolution to resign, and but a few days before their actual surrender, as he asserts; which of what value and consideration it is from the said council's cir|cumstanced under a necessity of resignation of their great charter, procured rather by the clamour of such ill af|fected persons as the present complaint than by any true accompt of dissettlement or ill management here, is not difficult to judge. Hence it appears, first, how little rea|son Mr. Mason hath to brand us with fraud or surrepti|tiousness in obtaining our charter; which hath most shew of fraud and surreptitious procuration, a sufficient num|ber of those honble persons subscribing ours and fewer his pretended antidated grants, is easie to determine. In which assertion is to be observed the high reflection cast upon the members of his late majesty and ministers of state, groundlessly rendring the council's seal, yea the great seal of England, exposed to fraud and deceitful clandes|tine practices; yea upon his present majesty, insinuating himselfe better acquainted with matters of state then he who allows and confirmes our grant as authentick by his gracious letter of sixteen hundred sixty two, which intol|erable boldness how unbecoming (not to say more) in a subject, it is not easie for us to say. To all which we may add Sr Ferdinando Gorges application to the author|ity here to interpose in his affair, which he, being one of the great council, would have been far from acknowledg|ing, had Mr. Mason's allegations been founded upon truth.</P>
<P>Secondly, That articles of charge depending upon such
<PB N="xxx" REF="024087_0400_0FC2F7C7B5E10F70">
illegal and post dated grants cannot take place against us were their disburse as great as it is affirmed, which by eyewitnesses upon the place and stil living, are proved com|paritively very inconsiderable.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. We affirme that the whole management of the affair respecting our government of those eastern parts was in an orderly and peaceable way, and not without the re|iterated and earnest sollicitation of most of the people there inhabiting, sufficiently appearing by their several petitions; and we challenge Mr. Gorge and Mr. Mason by any living evidence or record to shew any signe of a forceable en|trance: Some majistrates upon the clearing of our right to them and acceptance of the tender of themselves to us, being sent thither without any other force than each of them a servant to attend them. Indeed some years after Capt. Boniton for mutinous carriage was seized and brought to justice; concerning which and many other cases many inhabitants yet living and eye wittnesses can give the most impartial evidences.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. We offer to consideration that the deserted and ungovern'd state of the people of those places had we not had that patent right so clearly evinced, might warrant our actions; especially considering the obligation upon us to secure his majesty's honour and maintain the publick peace, so hazarded by the total want of government a|mongst them. Our first exercise of jurisdiction being in the year 1641, eight year after Capt. Neale, agent for Mr. Mason, had wholy deserted the improvement of land and the government of the country, which indeed he never used but one year, for in the year 1630 he first came over, and in the year 1634 he quitted the place; and in the in|terim neglected the same in making a voyage for England, the short time of his tarriance not admitting of set|tlement of government or improvement. We may hereto subjoin that Mr. Joseph Mason, agent for Mrs. Ann Mason, when here and all things were fresh in memory, made no demand contrary to what is affirmed, but petitioned our justice against his debtors there and elsewhere, and that Sr Ferdinando Gorges his grant being so mean and uncertainly bounded that he knew not well how to find much to less improve to considerable advan|tage, by his letter bearing date &mdash; doth devolve the whole charge and care of his pretended province upon
<PB N="xxxi" REF="024087_0401_0FC2F7C92D473F60">
the authority here established. Lastly, That the exercise of jurisdiction in those eastern parts hath been and is his majesty's honour, the people's great benefit, and our charge without profit, which had it not been, the ruine of those parts would have unavoidably ensued in the want of all government, and their seizure by the French, who ever waited a fit opportunity for the same. They have part of them for thirty five years and others twenty yeares (some small interruption intervening producing the strong|er inclination and resolution in them to be constant to his majesties authority here) lived under the government of the Massachusetts a quiet, well ordered and thriving peo|ple. And as for any complaint from ill affected persons, it is well known that the best and wisest government is not without disquiet from from some such; and no wonder if filly people are soon affected with such fair glozing promises as Mr. Mason hath made and published, as it were determining the case before tryal by his late letters to the inhabitants in those parts, and that our government in those places have been no gain is so unquestionable a truth that never was any levy laid upon them for the supply of the publick treasury, tho' much hath been and is further like to be expended for their security, who otherwise will inevitably become an easie pray to the heathen now in hostility with us, and at this present time rageing in those parts.</P>

<P>WHEREAS the right honourable the lords of the committee for trade and plantations, did in pur|suance of an order of the 7th of February last make re|port to the board, of the matters in controversey between the corporation of the Massachusetts Bay in New-Eng|land, and Mr. Mason and Mr. Gorges touching the right of soil and government, claimed by the said parties in certain lands there, by virtue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of several grants from his majesty's royal father and grandfather as followeth, in these words.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your majesty,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Having received your majesty's order in council of the 7th of February last past, whereby we are directed to en|ter into the examination of the bounds and limits which the corporation of the Massachusetts Bay in N. E. on the one hand, and Mr. Mason and Mr. Gorges on the other, do pretend by their several grants and patents to have been assigned unto them, as also to examine the patents and charters which are insisted on by either side, in order to find out and settle how far the rights of soil and gov|ernment do belong unto any of them. In consideration whereof the lords chief justices of your majesty's courts of king's bench and common pleas were appointed to give us their assistance, we did on the 5th of April last to|gether with the said lords chief justices meet in obedience to your majesty's commands, and having heard both par|ties by their council learned in the law, we did recom|mend unto their lordships to receive a state of the claims made by both parties, and to return their opinions upon the whole matter unto us, which their lordships have ac|cordingly performed in the words following:</P>
<P>In obedience to your lordships order we appointed a day for the hearing of all parties, and considering the mat|ters referred, having received from them such papers of their cases as they were pleased to deliver; at which time all parties appearing, the respondents did disclaim title to the lands claimed by the petitioners, and it appeared to us that the said lands are in the possession of several other persons not before us, whereupon we thought not fit to
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="024087_0403_0FC2F7DD3A78A4A8">
examine any claims to the said lands, it being (in our o|pinion) improper to judge of any title of land without hearing of the ter-tenants or some other persons on their behalf; and if there be any course of justice upon the place having jurisdiction, we esteem it most proper to di|rect the parties to have recourse thither for the decision of any question of property until it shall appear that there is just cause of complaint against the courts of justice there for injustice or grievance.</P>
<P>We did in the presence of said parties examine their several claims to the government, and the petitioners hav|ing waved the pretence of a grant of government from the council of Plymouth, wherein they were convinced by their own council that no such power or jurisdiction could be transferred or assigned by any colour of law; the ques|tion was reduced to the province of Maine, whereto the petitioner Gorges made his title by a grant from king Charles the first, in the 15th year of his reign, made to Sir Ferd. Gorges and his heirs of the province of Maine and the government thereof. In answer to this the re|spondents alledged that long before, viz. in quarto Caroli primi, the government was granted to them, and produc|ed copies of letters patents wherein it is recited that the council of Plymouth having granted to certain persons a territory thus described, viz.
<Q>all that part of New-Eng|land in America which lies and extends between a great river that is commonly called Monomack alias Merri|mack, and a certain other river there called Charles river, being in the bottom of a certain bay there call|ed the Massachusetts Bay, and also all and singular the lands and hereditaments whatsoever lying and being within the space of three English miles on the south part of the said Charles river, or any or every part thereof; and also all and singular the lands and hereditaments whatsoever lying and being with the space of three English miles to the southermost part of the said bay called Massachusetts Bay; and all those lands and he|reditaments whatsoever which [<HI>lie</HI>] within the space of three English miles to the northward of the said river called Monomack alias Merrimack, or the northward of any and every part thereof; and all lands and here|ditaments whatsoever lying within the limits aforesaid, north and south in latitude and breadth, and in length
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="024087_0404_0FC2F7DE70B23F60">
and longitude of and within all the breadth aforesaid throughout the main lands there, from the Atlantic and Western sea and ocean on the east part to the South sea on the west.</Q>
By the said letters patents the king con|firmed that grant, made them a corporation, and gave them power to make laws for the governing of the lands and the people therein. To which it was replied that the patent of 4^o Caroli primi is invalid, (1) Because there was a precedent grant, 18^o Jacobi, of the same thing then in being, which patent was surrendered afterwards and before the date of the other, 15^o Car. primi. (2) The grant of the government can extend no farther than the ownership of the soil, the boundaries of which as recited in that patent wholly excludes the province of Maine, which lies northward more than three miles beyond the river Mer|rimack.</P>
<P>We having considered these matters do humbly con|ceive as to the first matter, that the patent of 4^o Caroli 1^m^i is good notwithstanding the grant made in the 18^o Jac: for it appeared to us by the recital in the patent 4^o Caroli 1^m^i that the council of Plymouth had granted away all their interest in the lands the year before, and it must be presumed they then deserted the government; whereupon it was lawful and necessary for the king to establish a sui|table frame of government, according to his royal wisdom, which was done by that patent, 4^o Caroli 1^m^i making the adventurers a corporation upon the place. As to the second matter it seems to us to be very clear that the grant of the government 4^o Caroli 1^m^i extends no farth|er than the boundaries expressed in the patent, and those boundaries cannot be construed to extend further north|wards along the river Merrimack than three English miles, for the north and south bounds of the lands granted so far as the river extends are to follow the course of the rivers which make the breadth of the grant, the words describ|ing the length to comprehend all the lands from the At|lantick ocean to the South sea of and in all the breadth aforesaid, do not warrant the over reaching those bounds by imaginary lines or bounds, other exposition would (in our humble opinion) be unreasonable and against the interest of the grant. The words
<Q>of and in all the breadth aforesaid</Q>
shew that the breadth was not intend|ed an imaginary line of breadth, laid upon the broadest
<PB N="xxxv" REF="024087_0405_0FC2F7E1A2468170">
part but the breadth respecting the continuance of the boundaries by the river as far as the river<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> go, but when the known boundary of breadth determines it must be carried on by imaginary lines to the South sea. And if the province of Maine lies more northerly than three En|glish miles from the river Merrimack, the patent of 4^o Caroli 1^m^i gives no right to govern there, and thereupon the patent of the same 15^o Car. 1^m^i to the petitioner Gorges will be valid. So that upon the whole matter we are humbly of opinion as to the power of govern|ment, that the respondents, the Massachusetts and their successors, by their patent of 4^o martis 4^o Caroli 1^m^i have such right of government as is granted them by the same patent within the boundaries of their lands expressed therein, according to such description and exposition as we have thereof made as aforesaid, and the petitioner Sir Ferdinando Gorges his heirs and assigns by the patent 3d April, have such right of government as is granted them by the same patent within [<HI>the territory</HI>] called the pro|vince of Maine according to the boundaries of the same expressed in the same patent.</P>

THAT it having pleased your most excellent majesty to seperate us the inhabitants of this province from that shadow of your majesty's authority and government under which wee had long found protection, especially in the late war with the barbarous natives, who (thro' di|vine protection) proved a heavy scourge to us, and had certainly been the ruin of these poor weake plantacons, (being few in number and otherwaies being under great disadvantages) if our brethren and neighbours had not out of pity and compassion stretched forth their helping hand, and with their blood and treasure defended us, our lives, and estates; nevertheless upon the receipt of your majesty's pleasure delivered by Edward Randolph, esq. upon the first of January last, directing unto and commanding the erecting of a new government in and over these four townes (the government of the Massa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u|setts

<HEAD>No. XX. Answer to the claim made by Mr. Mason to the houses and lands of New-Hampshire. [In Mr. Weare's hand writing, but without date or sig|nature.]</HEAD>
<P>IT does not legally appear that Mr. Mason can lay any just claime to any of the lands in New-Hampshire, for what right he pretends is either derived from Capt. Jno. Mason, (whom he says was his grandfather) or from his majesty's commission: But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> neith|er of these has he any right. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from Capt. Jno. Mason; for, (1) it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> appear that ever he had any right to the province of New-Hampshire. It is true there is a copy of a pattent or deed from the coun|cell of Plymouth, which he brings over without attesta|tion of publique notary or any other authority. Besides in said coppy there is not the least intimation of any hand or seale to the originall, and there is two men that swears this is a true coppy of the originall, which plainly de|monstrates that the originall is but a blanck; the truth
<PB N="xlii" REF="024087_0412_0FC2F807F46ABF38">
whereof we are the more confirmed in, because it is not rational to imagine that Mr. Mason would come from England to prosecute a right and not bring with him what he had to make good his claime; but having noth|ing but blanck coppies, he could bring no better than he had, which cannot be looked upon as authentique in any court.</P>
<P N="2">(2) If it should be supposed that ever Capt. Jno. Ma|son had a right by pattent, yet it does not appear how Robert Tufton Mason (as the plantiffe calls himself) de|rives a title from him either as his heir, executor or ad|ministrator, or by deed of gift: all that we can hear in court is that the plantife calls himself Capt. Mason's heir.</P>
<P N="3">(3) If the plantiffe or his ancestors ever had a title to the lands he claims by pattent from the councill of Ply|mouth, yet they have lost it by non use, for they never attended the ends of granting patents by king James, of blessed memory, in his hyness pattent to the great coun|cell of Plymouth, which was the peopling of the land, inlargeing the king's dominions, propagating the gospel, conversion of the heathen the native proprietor's &amp;c. Now the plantife nor ancestors never planted this pro|vince nor expended any thing upon it to the upholding of it in peace nor war, but the present inhabitants did either by themselves or predecessors, purchase their pos|sessions from the natives, and by their permission did sit down upon the land and manured, to the vast expence of above 50 years time in hard labor, and expending upon it their whole estate. And in the late Indian war did defend it against the enimy to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oss of many of their lives and considerable part of their estates, without any assistance from Mr. Mason who now claimes not only what poor people have purchased and laboured hard upon but also conquered or relived from cruell attempts of the barbarous heathen, and we conceave we were under no obligation to run such adventures to make ourselves slaves to Mr. Mason.</P>
<P N="4">(4) It does not appear that there was a quorum of the great councell of Plymouth to the making of Capt. Ma|son's deed according to the patent granted to the great councell of Plymouth, which renders his claime unvalide,
<PB N="xliii" REF="024087_0413_0FC2F809C01218D0">
if ever any thing in that kind was done, which we ques|tion.</P>
<P>From what is said we humbly conceave Mr. Mason has no right from Capt. Jno. Mason.</P>
<P>And that his majestie's commission does neither give nor confirme any title to the lands claimed, we prove:</P>
<P N="1">(1) We humbly conceave that his royal majesty who is so prudent a prince and so solicitous for the peace of his subjects, would not have left that matter doubtfull to his subjects of this province but rather have told us that he had given all the lands to Mr. Mason, but there is noth|ing of gift to him in the commission and <HI>if his majesty had</HI> (which we cannot believe he would) we should crave the benefit of the statute in the 17^o of Charles the first, which says, No king and councell can alienate lands but by due course of law. But wee were never yet heard, and when it comes to legal tryal wee presume the law of possessions will confirm our lands to us, seeing we have had peaceable possession 50 yeares.</P>
<P N="2">(2) If his majesty had given the lands in the province to Mr. Mason, what can be understood by that clause in the commission
<Q>That in case the inhabitants shall refuse to agree with Mr. Mason, then the governor shall inter|pose and reconcile all differences if he can, but if he cannot then to send the case, fairl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> stated to England that his majesty and privy councell might determine accord|ing to right;</Q>
which wee humbly conceave puts a barr to any legal proceedings until his majesty's mind be furth|er known therein. The inhabitants have offered their reasons to the governor according to commission, which he will not admit of, only did take of one, viz. Capt. Stileman, and promised to send them to England, but we can hear of no answer and much fear his neglect.</P>
<P N="3">(3) His majesty in his commission says,
<Q>To prevent unreasonable demands that may be made by Mr. Mason for the right he claimes,</Q>
which claime may prove good or bad when it comes to tryall. We understand to claime and to have are different things.</P>
<P N="4">(4) His majesty intimates in his royal commission by what title Mr. Mason does claime, viz. by a grant to his ancestors,
<Q>who improved and possessed the province with great expence, until molested and finally driven out;</Q>
but this province cannot be concluded to be the place he
<PB N="xliv" REF="024087_0414_0FC2F80FB56E7F50">
claims until he make these circumstances appear, which we are sure he never can doe.</P>
<P>Now Mr. Mason not producing any original deed for any of the lands of this province, nor authentique copies, the inhabitants cannot make any compliance with him both because we see no right he ever had, or believing if ever any was he hath mortgaged it already in England, and so alienated what right he had.</P>
<P>Although upon the former grounds we have good plea against Mr. Mason's claime, yet we did not see cause to join issue, not only because judges and jurors were not qualified according to law, all of them being pickt for es|pousing Mr. Mason's interest by the governor's order, who has a mortgadge for 21 yeares from Mr. Mason for all the lands in the province. But also because wee was willing to attend the methods prescribed by his majesty in his royal commission.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Portsmo.
<DATE>the 15th of November, 1682.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>May it please your Honour.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN obedience to your command that I should render a reason why I refuse to pay quitrent unto Robert Ma|son, esq. (as he titles himself) for my house and lands, and take deeds from him for the confirming of the same, I answer as followeth:</P>
<P N="1">1stly. Because my said land I bought and paid for. The title unto which is successively derived unto me from those that have possessed it, without any claime for at least these 50 yeares, upon which I have built at my own charge without any interruption, and am in the pos|session thereof as my owne. As to what is said in the comission concerning Mr. Mason's proprieters, with all due submission to his majesty, I conceive it implys rath|er his claime than a positive determination of his title.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. I humbly conceive that being in possession of what I have bought and built upon, it rests upon the claimer to make out his title (if he have any by law),
<PB N="xlv" REF="024087_0415_0FC2F816D539D680">
begging the favour of an English subject therein, that it may be first tryed upon the place according to the statute law and the opinion of his majesty's judges in England, and this before I am liable to pay quit-rent and take deeds of confirmation from him.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Should Mr. Mason obtaine his demands, my|self and the rest of the inhabitants would be undone for|ever, for then all his granted to him which hee calls com|mons being out of fence, which yet hath been bounded out by the several towns and possessed by them for these 50 yeares, and improved for the maintainance of their cattle both winter and summer, and for timber and fire wood, without which there is no liveing for us, it being impossible for us to subsist upon that which in the com|mission is called gardens, orchards, if he may have the dis|posal of the rest.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The said Mason speaks of many thousands of pounds expended upon the place, which with submission cannot be made out, and if it could, what then have the poor planters expended in so many yeares labour since their first sitting downe upon it, when they found it an howling wilderness and <HI>vacuum domicilium,</HI> besides a great expence of blood and estate to defend it in the late Indian warr, nor can they to this day make both ends meet by all their labour and frugality, and therefore must needs sink under the exaction of such a propriator.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. The land which Mr. Mason claimes as propri|ator is the land on which such vast expence hath been laid out by his grandfather Captain John Mason, for the peopling of it and the land from whence his said grand|fathers servants were violently driven out, or expeled by the inhabitants of the Massathusets, but upon this land there was no such expence laid out by his grandfather Captain John Mason for the end aforesaid, nor is this the land from whence any servants of his said grandfather were so expelled, and therefore we that are possessed of this land are not concerned in his claime, hee ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> mis|taken his province and may endeavour to find it some other where, for here is no such place.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. If Mr. Mason had a patent here, why did he not take possession in the day thereof. If hee were in possession why did he not keep it still: None ever drove him out as he informs, had hee been once settled he might to this day
<PB N="xlvi" REF="024087_0416_0FC2F81813E7F280">
have kept it as the rest of the inhabitants have done with|out the least mollistation, but I am humbly of opinion that if he the said Mason or any of his ayres came hither, they only came as many ships did to Newfoundland and to this countrey to make a fishing voyadge or beaver trade, and that being at an end departed and left their room to the next taker.</P>
<P>This is the summe of what I have at present to an|swer, humbly requesting of your honour the stating of the case, with your opinion thereupon to his majesty as the commission directs; and when his majesty shall in his wisdom and justice see meet to order an hearing of the matter in his courts of judicature upon the place before a jury of uninterested and indifferent persons which may be had out of the neighbouring province, (and possibly Mr. Mason may think not attainable in this province where|in all persons are concerned,) as he hath been pleased to doe by that part of Mr. Mason's claime, which lyes un|der his majesty's government of the Massathusets, I hope to be able upon these and other grounds so far to make out my title as to be held unblameable before God and man, for not complying with his demands. Or if I should see cause to appeal to his majesty and honourable councell that I shall be put beyond all need of paying quit rent to the pretended propriator.</P>

charity</HI> for preventing the effusion of <HI>christian</HI> blood: And knowing that your honor has an influence upon the southern Indians our honourble governor was willing to take the trouble upon himself of a journey to New-York to treat with your honor for sending of such a number of Mahiquas, or other Indians, as may be convenient to as|sist in this service, and to make such capitulations and agreement as to his honor shall seem reasonable. We doubt not your honor's readiness in any thing that may tend to his majesty's service and the safety of his subjects, having often heard a noble character of your honor from our governor, whom we have intreated to present our let|ter with our most humble service. We have committed all matters to his honor's prudence and management and what his honor shall judg fit to be done we shall see performed. So praying for your honor's health and prosperity, we subscribe ourselves, (being his majesty's council of New-Hampshire)</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>[From the towne of Exeter.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>Most humbly sheweth,<LB>
THAT your petitioners predecessors having under the encouragement of your majesty's royal ances|tors by their letters patents to the great council of Ply|mouth, removed themselves and some of us into this re|mote and howling wilderness in pursuance of the glorious
<PB N="lii" REF="024087_0422_0FC2F82D06450AA0">
ends proposed, viz. The glory of God, the enlarging his majesty's dominions, and spreading the gospel among the heathen: And in order thereunto either found the lands we now possess <HI>vacuum domicilium,</HI> or purchased them of the heathen the native proprietors of the same, or at least by their allowance, approbacon or consent, have sate downe in the peaceable possession of the same for the space of above fifty years; hoping that as wee had attended the ends, soe wee should have shared in the pri|viledges of those royal letters patents above menconed, and thereupon did the more patiently beare and cheare|fully graple with those innumerable evils and difficulties that must necessarily accompany the settlers of new plan|tacons, especially in such climates as these, besides the ca|lamities of the late Indian warr to the loss of many of our lives, and the great impoverishment of the survivors. Wee were also further incouraged from your majesty's princely care in takeing us by your late commission un|der your majesty's immediate goverment, and appointing some among ourselves to govern us according to those methods there prescribed, being particulerly bound to discountenance vice and promote virtue and all good liueing, and to keep us in a due obedience to your majes|ty's authority and continuance of our just libertyes and propertyes, together with liberty of conscience in matters of worshipp, and all in order to our liueing in all godli|ness and honesty, fearing God and honouring the king, which wee profess to be our desire to doe.</P>
<P>But contrariwise partly by the unreasonable demands of our pretended proprietor Robert Mason, esq. and part|ly from sundry other reasons that are either effects or concomitants thereof wee are in a farr worse condition than any other your majesty's plantacons, and reduced to such confusions and extremities that necessitate our hum|ble application to your majesty, upon whose clemency and justice only under God we depend for our releife.</P>
<P>Your poore distressed and oppressed petitioners doe therefore most humbly supplicate your most gracious ma|jesty that you will vouchsafe to give leave unto one of ourselves, Mr. Nathaniel Weare, whom wee have sent for that end to spread before your sacred majesty and your most honourable privy councell our deploreable es|tate, the beholding of which we doubt not will move
<PB N="liii" REF="024087_0423_0FC2F82E783A8418">
compassion towards us, and your majesty's propensity to justice will incline to the using such meanes as to your wisdome shall seem best that the oppressed may be reliev|ed, wronged ones righted, and we your majesty's almost undone subjects now prostrate at your feet, may upon the tasteing of your equity and goodness, be raised and furth|er engaged in all humility and thankfulness as in duty bound evermore heartily to pray, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>No. XXIX. The deposition of Peter Coffin, esq. one of his majesty's justices of the peace for New-Hampshire, being sworn, saith,</HEAD>
<P>THAT sometime in the beginning of February, A. D. 1683/4, I the deponent was present at the house of Mr. John Hincks in company with the hon Edw. Cranfield, esq. governor of this province, where I heard the said governor send for Mr. Wm Vaughan, and when the said Vaughan came the governor enquired of him what affidavits those were he had that day desired to be taken. The said Vaughan answered, those that con|cerned his cause against Mr. Mason. The governor asked him who they were, he answered, if he might have summons he would bring them before his honour to be sworn; and then the governor brake out into a passion and told him, the said Vaughan, that he was a mutinous fellow, and asked him what he went lately to Boston for; the said Vaughan answered he went about his business. Then the governor said he went to carry a mutinous pe|tition to be sent to England by Weare, and asked him what vessel Weare went in; Mr. Vaughan answered that he left Weare in Boston. Then the governor said, that by the next ships after Weare was got to England and had presented his petition, he should have an account of the persons names that subscribed it returned to him, and that it would be the best hawl he ever had, for it would be worth &pound;. 100 a man. The governor f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rther said that the said Vaughan was a mutinous fellow, and required of him bonds to the good behaviour; Mr. Vaughan answer|ed he knew none of the king's laws he had broken, but if he could be informed of his crime he was ready to give bonds. And that in the whole discourse Mr. Vaughan demeaned himself with a great deal of moderation and submission. Notwithstanding which the governor com|manded a mittimes to be writ and signed the same with his own hand, whereupon the said Vaughan was forth|with committed to prison.</P>

<P>THESE serves to give covert to the inclosed which were unhappily mislaid, and so brought to Ports|mouth insted of beinge carried by you to London though on the other hand you carried many papers for London which oughte to have been at Portsmouth. There were severall papers in the bondle which were very impertinente unto your business, and the transpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tinge of them very prejudiciall to som here, your especyall care aboute them is expected, yet may be safely returned with you if not transmitted by you before you returne. Wee are now a doeinge aboute getinge evidenses sworne, which you shall have a further account by the firste, tho' re|tarded much by havinge no copies of them as we expect|ed. Sinse your departure much ado have been made, many execucyons extended, viz. upon Mrs. Cutt, Dan|iele, myself, Mr. Fletcher, Moody, Hunkins, Earle,

Picke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inges, Booth, &amp;c. I went to prison but was re|deemed with money, severall dores ware broken open by Mathews the marshall's deputy, chestes also and trunks and carried out of the house till redeemed with money. John Partridge and Wm Cotten are in prison and have been sundry daies. No pay (as fish, sheep, horses, &amp;c.) would be taken for their executyons, so there bodyes ware levied upon and there they lye. Our menister for refusinge to admenester the sacrament to the gouernor is bound over to the quarter sessions to sit tomoro, the isshew wee know not but six months imprisonment thretned. Your wife and famely well. Grete bluster at Hampton about the petityon, som weekelinges ware whegled into a confession and they discovered the per|sones that carried the petityon, who ware by justis G. &amp; R. bound over to the quarter sessions, but last Satterday night (on what ground know not) Mr. Greene burnte there bonds and only tould them they muste apere when cold for. Charles Hilton is lately ded. As other newes arrives shall hand it to you by all occatyones and doe you the like by us.</P>
<P N="5">5th. Quarter sessions are come, and there Capt. Bare|foote, Mr. Fryer, Coffin, Greene, Roby, Edgerly, were justices, Raines was attorny. It was brought in as a plea of the crowne. Mr. Moody pleaded his not beinge ordained, havinge no maintenance according to statute and therefore not obliged to that worke which the statute required. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">esides these statutes were not made for these plases, the knowne end of there removal hither beinge that they might enjoye liberty in these forrin plantatyones which these could not have by vertew of the statutes at home, and ware allowed to have here, especyally our co|mityon grantinge liberty of contyense. These things ware pleded, but to no purpose, after a shorte pleding and that not withoute many interopyones and smiles by the prag|matticke, busey impertenente atturny, he was comited to the marshall, (viz. Longe Matthews) and held in custody that night tho' permitted to lodge at Capt. Stileman's. The justises debated a littell, foure of them entered their desente, viz. Mr. Fryer, Greene, Roby, Edgerly, but Capt. Barefoote and Coffin ware for his condemnatyon. Judgment of the case, every man's was entered by the se|cretary over night, but being deferred till nexte morninge
<PB N="lix" REF="024087_0429_0FC2F84E1314EEF8">
informatyon was given to somebody who came in and thretned and hectored after such a rate that Greene and Roby also consented as you see by the inclosed, and hee was comited to prison. Petyon was by him made to the courte, and afterwards to the governor, that he might step up at nighte to his famely and settle matters there, and that he mighte not goe into the dismal plase the common prisson. The court could not, the governor would not of firste, tho' in fine gave leave to the mar|shall to droap him at Capt. Stileman's where he is confined to his chamber, tho' not without leave to goe downe staires or into the backside, and this was done 6th instante. At night I havinge moved for the takinge of evedenses, which was in words owned, wente to the secretary for summones, intendinge to begin with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Haull and Thos. Wiggones, hee refused to give summones but firste (I suppose) muste informe somebody, I was sent for by the marshall, huffed and hectored strangely, thret|ned, &amp;c. in fine, muste give bonds to the good behaviour; I refused, thereupon he made and signed my mitymos to the prison, though by the way, I knowe not how, was al|so droped at and confined to Mr. Moody's chamber, where we have bin this two nightes very chareful together.</P>
<P>Poore Wadlow who was left to the governor's mercy is com oute upon security for forty pounds mony, and your Gove for a like some, only Wm Partridge is to doe it in worke, buildinge and fensing, &amp;c. The actyons goe on and are turned of hand apase, <HI>twelve at a clapp,</HI> after the ould manner. Roby though a justis is still of the jury. A new tricke is on foote, severall of us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat ware executed upon and paid our mony the firste sute, are sued againe for illegal witholding possession, tho' the marshall (who was by executyon required to give pos|session never came to demand it;) the issue of which wee know not, matters being yet dependinge.</P>
<P N="9">9th. The prisoners Vaughan and Mr. Moody ware fetched out of prison to plede there casses at the courte. Mrs. Cutt, Daniell, John Partridge and myself and Mr. Moody ware sued and all caste, but the laste who had somethinge particulerly to saye, and soe he caste Mr. Mason, though wee thought wee all said enoufe to caste him, viz. that hee had an executyon for the land sued for
<PB N="lx" REF="024087_0430_0FC2F84F8158E4F8">
and when he levied his executyon mighte have taken the land also, with many other things (enofe of wee thought) to have turned the case against him before anny indifer|ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">udges and jurors, but thus we are tretted.</P>
<P>But above all our menester lyes in prison, and a fam|min of the word of god cominge upon us. No pub|lic worship, no preachinge of the word, what ignoranse profanes and misery must needes ensue! By the premises you see what need there is you should be vigoros and speedy as you maye aboute your busines to doe what may be to the preventinge of uter ruin.</P>
<P>My imprisonment is a presente stop to the getinge what evidenses is needful, and it's like we shall not make anny further attempt here, but with what conveniente ex|pedityon will be don what is needful and necessary. Mr. Martin was sued at the courte in two actyones, one by Mr. Mason for fines &amp; forfeitures collected and received by him as treasurer from seventy nine to eighty two, and another actyon by the governor for fines, &amp;c. from April eighty two. He is caste in both actyones to the valew of about seventy pounds, although he pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded that what hee received was disposed by order of the authority which made him treasurer, and had as good comition from his magestie as that was in being, neither did it legally appear that either Mr. Masson or the governor have anny righte to fines and for|fetures, the kinge appointinge all publicke mony to be disposed or improved for the suppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te of the government; however it is but aske and have, there demands in any case have the force of an executyon.</P>
<P N="10">10th. The sabath is come but no prechinge at the Banke, nor anny allowed to com to us; we had none but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with us, the pore peple wantinge for lake of bred. Motyones have bin made that Mr. Moo|dy may goe up and prech on the Lord's daye, tho' hee com downe to the prisson at night, or that naibor minist|ers might be permitted to com and prech, or that the peple might com downe to the prisson and here as many as could, but nothing will doe; an unparraleled exam|ple amongst christians to have a menester putt oute and no other way found to supply his plase by one menes or other. Mr. Frier was severely thretned for refuseinge to subscribe Mr. Moody's comitment, but hath obtained fairely a dismityon from all publike offices. Justice Ed|gerly
<PB N="lxi" REF="024087_0431_0FC2F85186FA1648">
also caishered, and bound over to the quarter ses|siones. It is said that justis Greene is much afflicted for what hee has done, but Roby not. Peter Coffin can scarse show his hed in anny company.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Moody in the church records remarks thus on his judges&punc;
<Q>Not long after Green repented and made his acknowledgement to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who frankly forgave him. Robie was excommunicated out of Hamp|ton church for a common drunkard and died excommunicate, and was by his friends thrown into a hole near his house for fear of an arrest of his carcase. Barefoote fell into a languishing distemper whereof he died. Coffin was taken by the Indians (at Cochecho 1689) his house and mill burnt, himself not being slain but dismissed; the Lord give him repentance, though no signs of it have yet appeared.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P N="14">14th. Nuse came from the fourte at Casco that there was greate danger of the Indyanes risinge, which hath occatyoned more sinse and hope it may vanish.</P>
<P N="15">15th. Good Mrs Martin was buried, being not able to live above one saboth after the shutting up the dores of the sanctuary. Somebody hath said the imprisoninge of the minister is noone of his worke, hee did but con|stitute the courte, they did it themselves, tho' also hath said hee would have don it himselfe if they had not.</P>
<P N="17">17th. Another sad saboth.</P>
<P N="18">18th. Came Mr. Mason, Barefoote and secretary, with Thurton, who swore aginst mee a false oath, of which have inclosed a copia. Thurton said he was sent for on purpose to give in his testimony against mee; they wente away, and soon after came the inclosed mittimos direct|ed to Mr. Raines hoo is shereff and marshall in Mr. Sheerlock's roome that have bin out of favor of late, though now it is said in favor but not in plase againe. Mr. Estwicke is also put oute of all offis. Noote, that when I wente to him for takeinge oathes, hee said all oathes should be taken before the governor and counsell, but now could send to justises to doe it. We had for some nightes our key taken away from the chamber dore about 8 or 9 at nighte but have sinse left off that trade. Sowell of Exeter is ded.

The marshall goes and levies upon John the Greeke's sheep and cattle for the executyon, for which hee had laine aboute three weekes in prisson, and then came and ordered him to goe about his busnesse, 15 sheepe, sundry lambes, and two haifers sezed for six pounds od mony. This day allso Mr. Jaffery havinge had sundery warninges the weeke before to clere his house becase Mr. Masson would com and take possession of it, wente never the les to the Banke upon busnes; me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e while came Mr. Mason with the marshall and turned all his servants out of dores, set another locke on the dore, and at night when his servants came home wett they would not suffer them to com in, but there lodged Matthews and Thur|ton all nighte.

<P>The governor havinge sente to Mr. Cotton, that when he had prepared his soule hee would com and demand the sacrament of him as hee had don at Portsmouth al|ready.

<P>One word more aboute my busnes. I am under im|prisonment aboute Thurton's busness, being seized by the marshall and comited when in prisson before for not giveing bond for the good behavior, tho' nothinge charg|ed upon me any more than before, which you well know. I know nothing but they intend to keep mee here end|lessly; it's saide I muste paye one hundred pounds for strikeinge one of the king's officers and muste have my name returned into the exchequer and muste lye in pris|son till the mony be paid and I am discharged from the exchequer. The designe you may esely see is to ruine mee, and how vaine my ples will be you maye esely guesse. Tho' I have manny thinges to saie, viz. that Thurton was ether no officer or at leste not knowne to be so, how|ever not sworne, nor did I strike him in the hyewaye as hee sweares, nor is there anny proofe but his owne single testimony, which how far it availes in such a case would be considered; it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s also worthy of inquire whether ever that law was intended for us, here beinge no customs to be gathered, no exchequer to be applyed to, and there|fore

how these methods can be observed is not intellega|ble. You may esely imagen how things will be if I am forsed to complye with there humors.

<P>I should have inserted what fell oute after the desolv|inge of the rebellyous assembly, there was discourse of constables, and insted of the freemen's chusinge as form|erly they tooke a shorte and cheper course, and at the quarter sessions constables were chosen and to begin with Mr. Speker, he has the honner to be constable for Ports|moth, Capt. Gerrish, Lt. Nutter and John Woodman for Dover, Smith the cooper for Hampton, John Foul|sham at Exeter. Whether Mr. Speker shall serve or fine is not yet determined. And now I am spekinge of the general assembly, muste hinte what was formerly forgotten, vz. that they convened on the Mondaye and the choice of the speker (there ould one) in words hily approved and he complemented alamode. Then a bill was sent them downe (of which if I can get it being now in prisson shall inclose a copia) which they talked a littel of and then brake up for the nighte and went up to the Banke to lodge (the tide serving very well to goe and com), the report of which hily disgusted, and the next morning the answer to the bill vehemently urged, which was in fine a negative. Hereupon in a great raidge telling them they had bin up to consult with Moody an utter enemy to church and coman welth with much of like nature, hee disolved them, which was don on the Tuesday, after which he came up to the Banke and gave order for a sacrament on the next Lord's daye as you

<P>By the premises you will see how the governor is mak|inge good his word <HI>hee came for mony and mony hee will gete,</HI> and if hee get it you know hoo must loose it, and how miserable muste our condityon quickly be if there be no remedy quickly provided. Hee contrives and cutts out worke and finds evill instrewments to make it up, and these som among ourselves. Thus we are cloven by our own limbes.</P>
<P N="28">28th. Sinse Mr. Jaffery was dispossessed, Raines offered him for five shillings per annum quit-rent to Mr. Mason, hee should have his house againe, provided he would owne him proprietor, but hee refusinge it is said he shall never have it againe. The talke is that his house muste be court-house and prison booth, and standinge so nere the governor it is judged sutable for booth those ends, that he may have the shorter journey to courte and the prisoners may bee alwaies under his eye.</P>
<P N="29">29th. John the Greeke havinge laine som weekes in prisson upon executyon, his goods havinge bin levied up|on (as above), was by Raines locked oute of the prisson and bidden to be gon, but he would not, keepes his quart|ers still with the other two. This daye his goods was sold by the marshall and bought by Thurton.</P>
<P>Mr. Cotton is com home from Boston. Grete offence taken here at a sermon hee preched in Boston on Acts xii.5. tho' plesing to the hearers.</P>
<P>March 2d. This day Mr. Jeffery's goods ware all turned out of dores by the sheriff, &amp;c. his man received and disposed of them. Against Jaffery there are two oathes taken, single oathes, but beinge for the king will passe, and orders are given for warrants to apprehend him, he apperes not.</P>
<P>March 5. It is said that they are goinge this daye to Major Waldrone's to serve him as they have done Mr. Jaffery, and it's given out that the reste will be treted in like manner; the courte was adjourned yesterdaye to the nexte month pbably that they mighte levey the execu|tyons that are in banke before they cutt oute anny more worke. Justis Green seems somethinge troubled for sendinge the menester to prisson, and saith he will never doe such a thinge againe, but Peter Coffin saith it is a nine

<P>In my laste I sente you a letter to Sir JOSIAH CHILD my master, of which also you have another copia here|with.

Matthews and Thurton hunted for Mr. Jafferey, serched in Mrs. Cutt's house, wente into every room a|bove and below staires, serched under her bed where she lay sike in it but found him not. They carried it very rudely and basely in there worke. Matthews said he would caitch him or have his harte blud, but hee was not there. Mr. Jafferey's goods were carried to the other side by nighte.</P>
<P>It is said that our imprisonment has much [<HI>alarmed</HI>] thee hoole countrey and made them more fond of ther liberties. This nighte Matthews was beten at Mersore's (som fudlinge boute its like), but its made a mity thing on, said to be a deepe plot, deeper than Gove's managed by strong heds, and abundanse of that nature, and because the persons conserned ware under the inflewense of Vaugh|an and Moody they should suffer for it, for not techinge them better.

<P>The governor profered mee (that whereas I was fined by the justices in Thurton's case, that I might thinke they had not done mee rite) that if I would prosecute it (giveing securety so to doe,) in the king's bench at West|minster, the exchequer, or before kinge and counsell, I should; though by his comityon hee could not do it. My anser was, unles I could have securety given mee that in case I should recover, I might have my charge and damidge made mee good, it would be of no benefit to mee. He said there was no reson for that, becase it was for the kinge; though it was his becase Mr. Mason had resignd up to the kinge all fines and forfitures and the kinge had given it to him. But he said if I would depo|site a valuable som hee would doe the like and would give bond, and have it tried as abovesaid. My answer was I thoughte the forty pounds was enofe and that I expected executyon would com oute at the time, and should endevour by the time to provide enofe for it, but withal tould the governor it was at his liberty to remit it if he pleased by vertue of his comityon.</P>
<P>Allso for my beinge in prison for not giveing bond for my good behaviour, when the sessiones came I was not broughte to my triall for that, but remanded to prisson again.</P>
<P>At ditto time the governor tould mee hee had put me in prisson on that account, and hee would abide by it till I would give two hundred pound bound. My anser was I had rather ly in prisson then give bond to tempt such a fello as Thurton, (or such others) that had sworne againste me alredy, and falsly, and judged it might be no scruple to him to doe the like again. And withal tould him that if his honner plesed to let mee oute of prisson, I would ingaidge myself by bond to live oute of the pro|vines, though that would be very detrementall to my conserns and by that I hoped he would have no thoughts of my misbehaveinge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that would be detrementall to the kinges governmente <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere or himself.

<P N="2"><PB N="lxxv" REF="024087_0445_0FC2F8982DA11B48">2. Although your majesty has been gratiously pleased by your said commission to interpose between the inhabi|tants of the said collony and Mr. Robt. Mason, <HI>pretended</HI> proprietor thereof, and to direct,</P>
<P><Q>That on non-agreement between those inhabitants and Mr. Mason, the said Mr. Cranfield should interpose, who if he could not end the differences between, was by the said commission directed to transmitt to England such cases impartially stated, with his opinion and reasons on the same, that your majesty with advice of your privy councill might heare and determine the same.</Q>
That nevertheless the said Mr. Cranfield, instead of keeping himself indifferent between the contending parties Mr. Mason and the said inhabitants, hath by purchase or mortgage from Mr. Mason made himself owner of the province: And the better to come by what he hath soe purchased, he hath under colour of the authority of your majesty's commission made courts, whereof both judges and jurors have agreed with Mason for their own lands, and some of them have taken grants from Mason of oth|er mens lands. That nevertheless this jury is continued from month to month and kept for this service.</P>
<P>That Mr. Mason has cast forty persons on suit by that jury, the court rejecting all pleas, and though the verdict be given for Mr. Mason according to your majesty's roy|al commission (which directs as before) and the judgement entered accordingly, yet upon the execucon the inhabitants are turned out of their lands and houses, as it hath fared with Wm. Vaughan and others, and deprived of all sub|sistance.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the charge of every action is raised from 20s. to 6l. which is exacted in money, and though goods ten|dered (as usual) the persons are imprisoned for want of money in kind, and Mr. Cranfield himself takes&mdash;of the 6l.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the said Mr. Cranfield under colour of trying actions, has by setting the fees soe extraordinary, forced severall to quitt their claimes for want of money to carry on the suite.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the said governor taking upon himself the power of priceing money not entrusted with him by his commission, hath against the agreement of the general assembly, by advice of his councill, ordered pieces of
<PB N="lxxvi" REF="024087_0446_0FC2F899AF2E9D00">
eight however wanting in their weight to pass for 6 shillings.</P>
<P N="6">6. That the said governor, without good and lawful cause, hath taken upon him to commit several men to prison, particularly Wm. Vaughan, until bonds given for their appearances and good behaviour, when noth|ing further objected to them.</P>
<P N="7">7. That the said governor and his council took upon them to make laws and put them in execution without the general assembly.</P>
<P N="8">8. That to prove the articles above against Mr. Cran|field, the complainants have successlessly endeavoured to procure warrants or summons from the secretary to sumon their witnesses to be sworne (which cannot other|wise be soe) the seeking of such summons has occasioned being bound to the good behaviour, soe as the complain|ing of a wrong done one does, under Mr. Cranfield's management, but draw a new punishment on the afflict|ed, but noe manner of redress.</P>
<P>All which the said Nath. Weare humbly lays at your majesty's feet, imploring your majesty's present heareing what your petitioner is able to make out of the premises, and ordering some commission to examine the truth of the residue of the said allegacons (since your majesty's governor on the place will not admit of such evidence.) That on the return thereof your majesty's subjects in that province may find such releife as to your princely wisedom shall seeme meete.</P>

As to the complaint of his having raised the value of coines a|gainst the laws of the assembly there, wee are most hum|bly of opinion that although it be your majesty's undoubt|ed prerogative to set and determine the price and value of coynes within your dominions, yet your majesty's gover|nor ought not to have made any alterations therein with|out having received your majesty's speciall directions.

<HEAD>To the king's most excellent majesty. The humble petition and address of your majesty's duti|ful and loyal subjects inhabiting in the province of New-Hampshire in New-England.
<DATE>[1685.]</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Most humbly sheweth,<LB>
THAT your majesty's loyal subjects of this province, had for more than fifty years been peaceably pos|sessed of the lands lately challenged by Mr. Mason, and having found the same an utter desert and forest land, with excessive cost and hard labour reduced the same to a tollerable support of our selves and familyes and lately maintained the same with a vast expence of our estates and lives against the incursions of a barbarous enemy who had otherwise reduced the same to utter confusion.</P>
<P>That upon his late majesty's declaration and order for the settlement and government of this province, wee ac|counted ourselves happy for that therein we were by his said majesty's princely grace and favour, saved from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> reasonable demands which Mr. Mason might have made upon us, by the limitations in the commission for gov|ernment, wherein it was provided that the said president or governor for the time being, should use all methods by his good advice to settle and quiet the people in the matter of Mr. Mason's title, or otherwise impartially to state the
<PB N="xciii" REF="024087_0453_0FC2F8B665907480">
case and report the same to his majesty, that a finall de|termination might thereupon have been made by his ma|jesty in councell, which if it had been duely attended had we doubt not long since by your majesty's justice and fa|vour putt us into an happy estate of quiet and repose.</P>
<P>That notwithstanding his said majesty's command and limitation, the said Mr. Mason hath been allowed to pur|sue many of the inhabitants, in several suites and actions, wherein the government have taken to themselves power of an absolute judgment without any regard had to the said commands and limitations, and with that excess and rigor as to assigne the said Mr. Mason sometimes tenn pounds, other times twenty pounds cost, when damages have been sometimes not above two shillings, very seldom ten according to the orders and limitations abovesaid.</P>
<P>That the said Mr. Mason beyond and beside the said quit rents, and directly against his majesty's order in the said commission, wherein the tennure of improved lands is assured to the ter-tenants upon payment of the said quitt rent, or otherwise as his majesty in councill should determine, hath disposed or given away the fee to several persons of several lands which were longe before his chal|lenge fenced and improved by others, to the great dam|age and injury of his majesty's good subjects, beside many other irregularities in the management of the government, to the greate oppression and destruction of trade within your majesty's province, and the utter impoverishing thereof.</P>
<P>That for the last two yeare's and upward dureing the whole management of Mr. Mason's suits at law against your majesty's subjects, there hath been generally one ju|ry returned to serve all the said issues with little altera|tions and almost constantly one foreman, (who for that end wee are apt to feare) was early complied with by Mr. Mason for all the lands in his owne possession formerly, with addition of several other lands to his owne proffitt.</P>
<P>That notwithstanding your majesty's late gracious or|der, and inhibiting of any further procedure in the case of Mr. Mason's title, until the cause were brought before your majesty in council, Mr. Walter Barefoote who was left deputy governor, hath since the arrival of your ma|jesty's commands permitted executions to be extended, and persons thereupon imprisoned in causes concerning
<PB N="xciv" REF="024087_0454_0FC2F8C3C32D27F8">
the said Masons title, with excessive and unreasonable costs and damages.</P>
<P>And lastly, whereas your majesty hath upon complaint made against the irregular proceedings done and suffered, been graciously pleased to permit Mr. William Vaughan, one of the principal inhabitants and merchants in this province, to take his appeale to your majesty in councill for relief, against severall oppressive judgments, one where|of referrs to the title of his lands within this province hold|en in the same form with the rest of his majesty's good subjects here, wee do with all humble gratitude acknow|ledge your majesty's justice and favour herein and for that the pursuance and issue of the said appeale will therefore necessarily affect the whole province and be introductory to the determination of all Mr. Mason's challenge, we have judged it our duty in most humble manner to prostrate ourselves at your Majesty's feete, and have therefore be|trusted and fully empowered Mr. Nathaniel Weare one of the inhabitants of this your majesty's province our a|gent to lay before your majesty and most honorable privy council the common case and condition of your majesty's poore and distressed subjects in this province, who is fully instructed humbly to represent the same, and the arbitra|ry and severe oppressions wee have laboured under, from which wee are well assured of reliefe by your majesty's most just and gracious determination, and to make an humble and entire submission of ourselves unto your ma|jesty's pleasure, most humbly beseeching that wee may henceforward have our perfect and immediate dependence upon your majesty and the crown of England as well in the tennure of our lands as in the affairs of government, which gracious influence of your majesty is only able to revive and restore this province to its former flourish|ing estate and growth, whereby we may at length be made serviceable to your most sacred majesty and the crowne which wee are devoted to serve, resolving therein to be exemplary to all other your majesty's subjects in the territory of New-England, and for which wee shall ever pray, &amp;c.</P>

<P>ACCORDINGE to your command and order to me, bearinge date the 2d instant, I have to the utmost of my power observed every particular. Upon our arri|val there on Friday night they were all very courteous to us, and in the morninge my orders were read which was very kindly received by them, and the reasons why they deserted the places where they usually abode among the English was,</P>
<P N="1">1 That four Indians came from fort Albany to the sort at Pennicooke and informed them that all the Mo|hawkes did declare they would kill all Indians from Un|cas at mount Hope to the eastward as far as Pegypscut.</P>
<P N="2">2. The reason of Natombamat, sagamore of Saco, de|parted his place was, because the same news was brought there as himself declared upon reading my orders at Pen|nicooke.</P>
<P N="3">3. Natombamat, sagamore of Saco, is gone to carry the Indians downe to the same place where they were be|fore departed from us, on Sunday morninge, and desired Capt. Hooke to meet him at Saco, five days after.</P>
<P N="4">4. Both segamores of Pennicook, viz. Wannilanset and Mesandowit, the latter of which is come downe, did then declare they had no intention of war, neither indeed are they in any posture for war, beinge about 24 men besides squaws and paposes.</P>
<P N="5">5. Asking the reason why they did not come among the English as formerly, they answered they thought if the Mohawkes came and fought them and they should fly for succour to the English, that then the Mohawkes would kill all the English for harboring them.</P>

<HEAD>No. XLVIII. Copy of an address of the general court to Queen Anne, De|cem. <HI>6, 1706.</HI> [Council minutes.]</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the queen's most excellent majesty. The address of your majesty's most dutiful and loyal sub|jects, the governor, council, and representatives of your majesty's province of New-Hampshire in New-England, convened in general assembly,</OPENER>
<P>Most humbly sheweth,<LB>
THAT in the midst of the great distresses, that your majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects of this your majesty's province were involved in, by the frequent incursions of our ill neighbours the French of Canada and their dependent Indians, to the great hurt of our plantations and settlements, your sacred majesty has been pleased of your royal bounty and compassion to supply us with a number of cannon and stores for our defence, the receipt whereof has invigorated and encouraged us in the defence of our frontiers, and our marches against the In|dians in their secret recesses in the woods, which are al|ways and still successfully put forward by your majesty's governor for our security, to our perfect satisfaction.</P>
<P>That while we were thus defending ourselves and fam|ilies, against the common enemy of the repose of all your majesty's British subjects in the plantations abroad as well as in Europe, we were pursued by the challenge of Mr. Allen for the lands and soil under our feet, which we have this sixty years defended with our lives and estates, as well as the assistance of our good neighbours of our majesty's colony of the Massachusetts, your majesty of your royal and princely regard to us has dismissed that challenge, which will forever encourage us to our utmost power to defend this your majesty's province, since we may now hope to leave our children in the possession of the country, with an entire dependance upon your ma|jesty and your royal successors without the danger of any further unjust challenge from those persons that have so long disturbed us with their claims.</P>
<P>And whereas your majesty out of a gracious regard to this and other your provinces in these parts of America&punc;
<PB N="ciii" REF="024087_0463_0FC2F8FDC65379F0">
was pleased to form a design against the French settlements at Canada and Nova-Scotia the last summer, but a more important service in Europe requiring your majesty's for|ces which were intended hither, whereby that design is laid aside for the present; we most humbly pray your majesty that it may consist with your royal pleasure to re|vive the said design, and that the expedition lately intend|ed may be prosecuted seasonably the next spring; and that your majesty's arms in America may have a glorious suc|cess as in Europe, to the utter confusion of your enemies, and lasting repose of all your majesty's good subjects in|habiting this continent.</P>
<P>We most humbly render our everlasting praises to Al|mighty God for your majesty's most glorious successes against the tyranny and usurpation of the French king and heartily pray for your majesty's long life and happy reign and the continuance of the protestant succession, for the benefit of your majesty's subjects of Great Britain, of all your majesty's dominions and plantations, and of all Europe who have had the unspeakable benefit of your majesty's unparalleled reign.</P>
