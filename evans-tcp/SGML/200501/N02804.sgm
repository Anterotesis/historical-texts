<Q><HI>And</HI> SAMUEL <HI>said unto the</HI> PEOPLE; <HI>It is the LORD that advanced</HI> MOSES <HI>and</HI> AARON, <HI>and that brought up your</HI> FATHERS <HI>out of the Land of</HI> AEgypt; <HI>Now therefore, stand still, that I may Reason with you before the LORD, of all the Righteous Acts of the LORD, which He did to</HI> YOU <HI>and to your</HI> FATHERS.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THAT we may form a clear Prospect of the Occasion and Propriety of this Address of SAMUEL; we must ima|gine we see the Tribes of ISRAEL as|sembled now before Him at <HI>Gilgal,</HI> to behold this illustrious Person laying down the chief Part of his Civil Power and resigning it to another, whom the GOD of Heaven had so highly honoured as to raise Him up from among his Brethren and set Him over that distinguished People.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003343_0005_0FF7E47A519C6470">
And it is indeed astonishing to see with what a noble, unaffected and inimitable Majesty, this most extraordi|nary <HI>Judge and Prophet</HI> makes the publick Resigna|tion: With what a just <HI>Concern</HI> for the Security of his own unblemish'd Character, and with what a flaming <HI>Zeal</HI> for the continued Honour of GOD, the Mainte|nance of his pure Religion, the Welfare of his People, and the Prosperity of the succeeding Governour.</P>
<P>Read this admirable <HI>Chapter,</HI> and keep in view the great Occasion, the superiour Person speaking, the vast and attentive Audience, the chief Ruler now before Him, the Things deliver'd, and the Air and Manner of the whole Transaction&mdash;and you will see in all, such a plain, venerable and sublime Grandeur, as I know of nothing among the meer Sons of Men has been ever like it, unless it were in MOSES, and none but one ap|parently inspir'd &amp; filled with the <HI>DIVINE SPIRIT</HI> can pretend to imitate.</P>
<P>Having first receiv'd their universal <HI>Approbation</HI> of his intire Conduct; He cannot leave his beloved Peo|ple without the most publick, plain and solemn <HI>Ad|monitions and Advices;</HI> that they may prove a wise and happy People under the Influence of their new Governour.</P>
<P>Resigning therefore now the chief Seat of Civil Power, but retaining the superiour Office and Authority of a <HI>Public Prophet;</HI> He becomes a Divine Preacher to the listening Congregation, and begins his Sermon with the awakening Introduction in the Words before us. Of which I now propose by the Divine Help to treat, under these <HI>three</HI> general Heads,</P>
<P N="1">1. To consider the Words as applicable to <HI>that special People,</HI> to whom they were at first directed.</P>
<P N="2">2. Raise some <HI>general Observations</HI> from them. And then,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>&amp; lastly,</HI> Apply the Words and those Observations to <HI>this particular People</HI> in our own Land.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="003343_0006_0FF7E47E8F9A8990">
<HI>I.</HI> To consider the Text as applicable to <HI>that spe|cial People</HI> to whom it was at first directed.</P>
<P><HI>And</HI> SAMUEL <HI>said unto the</HI> PEOPLE&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>i. e.</HI> To the <HI>whole Assembly</HI> then and there con|vened, not only comprehensive of the common People, but also, in a special manner, the Heads and Represen|tatives of the several Tribes and Towns of ISRAEL.</P>
<P>In the first Verse of the <HI>Chapter,</HI> they are said to be <HI>all</HI> ISRAEL; in the last of the foregoing, to be <HI>all the Men of</HI> ISRAEL; and by the 8th Verse, it seems they were at least <HI>Three hundred Thousand.</HI></P>
<P>But we may by no means imagine, that this was a meer confused Multitude without any comely Order or Distinc|tion. For they had an excellent Frame of Government established over their several Tribes and Families; whereby their Tribes and Families were both kept in order and preserv'd intire from their original.</P>
<P>It wou'd be a very instructive Entertainment, to trace it out in all its Branches and Alterations, as they are successively represented in the sacred Records. But the time wou'd fail me: And I may only observe, that before ever they came out of AEGYPT, they had their ELDERS in their several Tribes, who were Men of chief Renown and Esteem among them for their singular A|bilities and publick Virtues; who by reason of these had a publick Influence over them, and to whose especial Conduct they resign'd their publick Affairs &amp; Interests.</P>
<P>For thus says GOD to MOSES, at his first Appearance, in the burning Bush, Exod. iii. 16, 18, <HI>Go and gather the</HI> ELDERS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The SEPTUAGINT here calls them the SENATE of ISRAEL: And the learned AINSWORTH observes, they were not only Men of AGE, but also TEACHERS and RULERS among the People, as there were among other Nations, Gen. L. 7. Numb. xxii 4, 7. Josh. ix. 11.</NOTE> <HI>of</HI> ISRAEL <HI>together,</HI> &amp;c. In the fol|lowing 
<PB N="4" REF="003343_0007_0FF7E482194D43B0">
<HI>Chapter,</HI> vers. 29, we read that MOSES <HI>and</HI> AARON <HI>went and gathered together all the</HI> ELDERS <HI>of the Children of</HI> ISRAEL: And these very <HI>Elders</HI> are called the <HI>People,</HI> in the following Verses: which seems to intimate, that either there were a considerable Number of them, and 'tis likely all their Rulers both of the higher and lower Orders; or they represented the Community, or that a great Company of others out of every Tribe attended and assembled with them; on which account the <HI>whole Convention</HI> is styl'd the <HI>People.</HI></P>
<P>Of these <HI>Elders</HI> we also read upon their coming into the <HI>Wilderness</HI> in the xii, xvii, and xviii <HI>Chapters.</HI> And then under their sovereign Ruler MOSES, there were chosen out of every <HI>Tribe,</HI> the most known among them for Ability, Wisdom, Understanding, Religion, Truth, and the Hatred of Covetousness; to preside over <HI>them,</HI> and the several <HI>Thousands, Hundreds, Fifties</HI> and <HI>Tens,</HI> i. e. not of <HI>Persons</HI> but of <HI>Households</HI> in them. <HI>Exod.</HI> xviii. 13,&mdash;<HI>e.</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Compared with Deut. I. 9,&mdash;18.</NOTE> And in <HI>Chap.</HI> xix. 7. we read again of MOSES calling for the <HI>Elders</HI> of the People: And these are also stil'd the <HI>People,</HI> in the two following <HI>Verses</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Of these see likewise, in Lev. iv. &amp; ix. Numb. xvi. Daut. v. xxvii, xxix, xxxi Josh, vii, viii, xxiii, xxiv. Judg. ii, xxi, and 1 Sam. iv. And by the general Tenour of their History, they seem to be not meerly RULERS over the People, but their REPRESENTATIVES also; or rather Representatives in a double quality; i. e; They both represented the Privileges and Mind of the PEOPLE, who chose them, to their sovereign Ruler, and the Mind and Power of the SOVEREIGN RULER, who ap|prov'd them, to the People: They seem to be wise and grave MEDIATORS between the Will and Power of the one, and the Privileges and Inclinations of the other, and their Business was to observe, advise and temper both, and ballance them together.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In <HI>Exod.</HI> xxiv. and <HI>Numb.</HI> xi, we read of <HI>seventy</HI> Men selected out of the abovesaid <HI>Elders,</HI> who with MOSES <HI>and</HI> AARON seem to be form'd into a supream Court of Judicature over all the Tribes; not destructive of the 
<PB N="5" REF="003343_0008_0FF7E48566F290D8">
other Orders, but superiour only to them. And in <HI>Deut.</HI> xix, xxi, xxii, xxv, and <HI>Josh.</HI> xx, there are several Laws requiring <HI>Elders</HI> in <HI>every City.</HI> Agreably to this we read in <HI>Gideon's</HI> Days, of the <HI>Princes &amp; Elders of</HI> SUCCOTH, a City in the Tribe of <HI>Gad</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxlii. 17. Josh. xii, 27. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> 1 King. vii. 46.</NOTE>, even <HI>seventy seven</HI> Men, <HI>Judg.</HI> viii. 6&mdash;16. In <HI>Jeptha'</HI>s Days of the <HI>Elders of</HI> GILEAD, <HI>Judg</HI> xi. 5,&mdash;11. In the Days of <HI>Boaz,</HI> of <HI>Ten</HI> of the <HI>Elders of</HI> BETH|LEHEM, <HI>Ruth</HI> iv 2,&mdash;11. And in <HI>Samuel'</HI>s Days, of the <HI>Elders of</HI> JABESH, in the <HI>Chapter</HI> before our Text, <HI>Verse</HI> the 3d.</P>
<P>In 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> viii. 4. we read of <HI>all the Elders of</HI> ISRAEL <HI>gathering themselves together</HI> to Him: and in the fol|lowing Verses, <HI>these</HI> are likewise stil'd the <HI>People.</HI> By these <HI>Elders</HI> may be therefore meant, not only all the Members of the supreme Court of the <HI>Seventy,</HI> but also all others in Place of Power throughout their Tribes and Cities. And in that great Convention, they may be stil'd the People; because they seem to come as their chosen <HI>Representatives,</HI> and 'tis likely that a numerous Company of others assembled with them.</P>
<P>To such another <HI>Great and General Assembly,</HI> com|prehending all ISRAEL in a regular Epitome, together with a vast Confluence of People of the Civil, Ecclesi|astical and Military Orders, does this great Prophet now direct his inspired Oration.</P>
<P>And in the Text are these <HI>two</HI> things&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. A preliminary <HI>Observation</HI> made, as the general Ground of his designed Argument.</P>
<P N="2">2. A general <HI>Inference</HI> He derives from thence, to excite their close Attention to his Treatment of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. A preliminary <HI>Observation</HI> made, as the general Ground of his designed Argument. <HI>It is the LORD that advanced</HI> MOSES <HI>and</HI> AARON, <HI>and that brought up your</HI> FATHERS <HI>out of the Land of</HI> AEGYPT.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003343_0009_0FF7E489B70CA6C0">
Behold, how this wise and great Master of Assemblies, first leads them back to the Fountain-Head of their present State and Happiness: that they may take a lively and short Review of the Divine Appearance for their FORE-FATHERS; in Raising up such superiour Persons as MOSES and AARON, as their distinguish'd Heads and Leaders; and by these renowned Men Conducting them out of the Land of their Oppressions, and thro' all the difficult and hideous Scenes of their Progress thro' the Wilderness to their desired Country.</P>
<P>And in this Review we in the first place see the soar|ing <HI>Piety</HI> this Divine Preacher wou'd infuse into his listening Hearers. For He first Raises up their Minds to Heaven, and begins with this&mdash;<HI>It is the LORD that advanced</HI> those extraordinary Leaders MOSES &amp; AARON, <HI>and that brought up your</HI> FATHERS <HI>out of the Land of</HI> AEGYPT.</P>
<P>By their FATHERS is most plainly meant, not the im|mediate Fathers of the Generation then subsisting in SAMUEL'S Days, but those more ancient Fathers who came out of AEGYPT about 400 <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">426. according to the accurate Mr. TALLENTS.</NOTE> Years before, and were first in Forming their Civil and Ecclesiastical State. They were the near Descendants of JACOB, ISAAC, and ABRAHAM, who had a little before renounc'd the Ido|latry of the Nations round about them, reform'd their Families, embrac'd the pure Worship of GOD, and were accepted into Covenant with Him.</P>
<P>AEGYPT a very fruitful Land, and where all sorts of Arts and Sciences both for Use and Ornament were flour|ishing in those early Ages, was the Place of their Nati|vity and Education; and there they had both Houses, Flocks and Pastures of their own Propriety. But they were of a particular <HI>Religion,</HI> purely reveal'd from GOD, and free from all those Humane Inventions and Super|stitious Customs which were then the establish'd and reigning way of Worship in that ancient Kingdom. And those pious Fathers adhering closely to their inspired Re|ligion, 
<PB N="7" REF="003343_0010_0FF7E48CEE275E60">
refusing Mixtures with their Neighbours, preser|ving a visible Destinction from them, and growing nu|merous and powerful, they became ocnoxious to the <HI>Egygtian</HI> Jealousy.</P>
<P>Thro' the Reigns of some of their <HI>former Sovereigns,</HI> they were very kindly entertained and indulged. But upon the rising or a <HI>New King</HI> over AEGYPT, who had no Favour for them; He tho't to deal wisely with them, and as the Martyr STEPHEN expresses it, Act. vii. 19. <HI>He evilly entreated our Fathers.</HI> Yea MOSES a publick Eye Witness, tells us, that the King and his Courtiers <HI>set over them Task-masters to afflict them with their Burthens;</HI> and these cruel Officers <HI>made the Children of</HI> ISRAEL <HI>serve with</HI> so much <HI>Rigour,</HI> that <HI>they made their Lives bitter <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> hard Bondage,</HI> Exod. i. 7&mdash;14.</P>
<P>However, as they sigh'd and cried, their Crie came up to Heaven; and GOD heard their Groaning, and remembred his Covenant, and had respect unto them; as in the latter end of the following <HI>Chapter.</HI></P>
<P>Now therefore He advances MOSES and AARON to espouse their Cause, and head their Tribes, and lead them out of this inhospitable Land, to distant Regions of Ease and Liberty.</P>
<P>If I were to display the Characters of these illustrious Persons, I should not know when to end. And yet I cannot forbare observing, They were two most lovely Brethren, the Sons of AMRAM, the Son of KOHATH, the Son of LEVI; of vastly different Educations, but remarkably raised up by Heaven, inspir'd and strength|ened in a happy Union, to lead the People out of AEGYPT, and become the several Heads, MOSES of the Civil, and AARON of the Ecclesiastical Orders, under GOD in ISRAEL.</P>
<P>As for MOSES&mdash;He was exceeding fair and beautiful when born. Act. vii. 20. The <HI>Original</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> seems to 
<PB N="8" REF="003343_0011_0FF7E4906A8BFF90">
intimate as if a Divine Beauty appear'd upon him. But his parents being afraid to keep him in their own House, thro' the cruel Inquisition of the times, laid him in an Ark of Rushes among the Flags on the River NILUS: where <HI>Pharoah's Daughter</HI> finding him, had compassion on him, took him up and nourish'd him as her own Son. By this means he came to be learned in all the Wisdom of AEGYPT. He liv'd in the Royal Family for <HI>Forty</HI> Years: and then from a Principle of Faith and Piety, he renounc'd it: Refusing to be called the Son of <HI>Pharoah's Daughter,</HI> rather chusing to suffer affliction with the People of GOD than to enjoy the pleasures of Sin for a Season, esteeming the Reproach of CHRIST greater Riches then the Treasures in AEGYPT; for he had respect to the Recompence of the Reward. <HI>Forty</HI> Years more he lived as a Strange Shepard in the Land of MIDIAN. And then the LORD appeared to him in a flaming Bush, yet unconsumed, and called him to take the care of his afflicted People, and lead them out of AEGYPT.</P>
<P>He was the meekest Man upon the Face of the Earth: and on this account most eminently fitted to bare the Burthen of so difficult and great a People. He was made a GOD to <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> by a Divine appearance that attended him in all his Transactions with that haughty Monarch. He was mighty both in Word and Deed. And he became KING in JESHURUN, when the Head of the People and the Tribes of ISRAEL were gathered together. And then with what wonderful Patience did He for <HI>Forty</HI> Years bare their ungrateful Murmurings and Strivings!&mdash;With what an astonishing Greatness of Soul, that all their Provocations cou'd never but once roil him into an indecent Expression! How often did he stand in the Breach, to turn away the Wrath of GOD, that He might not destroy <HI>them!</HI> How nobly refuse the Offer of having his own Posterity made a greater Nation, rather than <HI>They</HI> should perish and the Name of the GOD of ISRAEL be dishonoured in their utter Ruin! How He Pray'd that GOD wou'd rather blot Him out of his Book, than not forgive their provo|king Sins: And how earnest, pressing and persevering in his Intercessions for them!</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003343_0012_0FF7E494E45D3828">
In short, Of all the <HI>Prophets</HI> that arose in ISRAEL, there was none like Him, whom the LORD knew Face to Face, and spake to Him as a Man speaks to his Friend. And behold&mdash;what surprizing <HI>Honours</HI> the GOD of Heaven was pleas'd to do Him, above every other mere Man that ever liv'd on the Earth! While all the Tribes are trembling round about Mount <HI>Sinai</HI>&mdash;MOSES goes up into the glowing Fire, and speaks with GOD, and bares it for <HI>Forty</HI> Days and <HI>Forty</HI> Nights together: While the Divine Brightness wro't such transforming and astonishing Impressions on Him, as to make his Face to shine with so great a Lustre; that when He came down the Mountain, AARON and all the Children of ISRAEL were afraid to draw near Him, and He was forc'd to vail it, that they might be able to indure his Presence. When He goes into the Ta|bernacle, in the sight of all the People, the <HI>Pillar of Fire</HI> descends down to the Door in Honour of Him: When He comes out, it rises up in the midst of the Fir|mament, to signify, it nothing now to do but enlighten and awe the Congregation and observe the Reverence they paid Him. And when some of the <HI>Chief</HI> among them spake against Him, the LORD came down in the <HI>Pillar of the Cloud,</HI> and stood in the Door of the Tabernacle, and called them and said <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. xii. 6,&mdash;8.</NOTE> "<HI>Hear now my Words! If there be a</HI> Prophet <HI>among</HI> You, <HI>I the LORD will make my self known to</HI> Him <HI>in a Vision, and will speak to</HI> Him <HI>in a Dream. My Servant</HI> MOSES <HI>is not so, who is faithfull in all mine House: With</HI> HIM <HI>will I speak Mouth to Mouth, even apparently and not in dark Speeches, and the Similitude of the LORD shall</HI> HE <HI>behold: Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my Servant</HI> MOSES? And the Anger of the LORD was kindled against them.</P>
<P>And as for AARON&mdash;he was the elder Brother of MOSES, commended of GOD for the Grace of his Lips, and honoured with this distinguishing Title&mdash;<HI>The Saint of the LORD.</HI> He made him the Spokesman and Pro|phet 
<PB N="10" REF="003343_0013_0FF7E49A5C4B58E0">
of MOSES, both to the <HI>People</HI> and to <HI>Pharaoh.</HI> The GOD of Heaven also spake immediately to him, and sent him to meet and unite with MOSES: and he went and met him in the Mount of GOD and kissed him, and they rejoyced in meeting and uniting for the Redemption of ISRAEL. He first spake the Words of the LORD to the Elders of the Tribes, and did the Signs in the sight of the People. He went in with MOSES to <HI>Pharaoh</HI> with the Rod of GOD in his Hand; and he said to the King; <HI>Thus saith the LORD God of</HI> ISRAEL, <HI>Let my People go.</HI> He cast down the Rod be|fore him, and it became a <HI>Serpent,</HI> which swallowed up the Rods of the Magicians: He stretched it out upon the Waters, and they were turned into <HI>Blood:</HI> He stretched it out again, and the <HI>Frogs</HI> came up and covered the Land: He smote the Dust of the Earth, and it was turn'd into swarms of <HI>Lice</HI> round about; and the Magicians own'd it to be the Power of the ALMIGHTY.</P>
<P>With MOSES he combin'd in leading ISRAEL out of AEGYPT, in receiving the Revelations of the Mind of GOD, and in delivering, them to the Congregation. And when he came to SINAI, he was by the Divine Appointment raised to the Head of the <HI>Priesthood:</HI> He was chosen out of all Men living to offer Sacrifice and Incense to the GOD of Heaven: and he had the singular Honour of the <HI>Priestly Office</HI> conferred upon his Offspring, as long as the Seed of ISRAEL should continue a Nation.</P>
<P>These are that MOSES and AARON which the LORD <HI>advanced</HI> in the Days of their Fathers, to lead them out of AEGYPT and found their State, to establish their sacred Relation to GOD, to give them their excellent Con|stitutions and Laws, and make them so renowned in the World.</P>
<P>The Word&mdash;<HI>Advanced</HI>&mdash;signifies both Provided, created, <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Arab.</NOTE> made, <NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Sept. Syr. Chal. Vulg, &amp; Mont, in Bib. Pelyg, &amp;c.</NOTE> prepared, instructed, trained and

raised up, improv'd, adorned, furnish'd, fitted, consti|tuted, preferred and promoted to Power and Dignity. It is comprehensive of all these Senses, and so 'tis ren|dered by learned Men <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Mercer. Buxt. Castle, Leigh &amp; Pol. Synops.</NOTE>. And the general Meaning is&mdash;It is the LORD that made them in such a special Season when his People wanted them: that gave them their several excellent natural Powers, that brought them forth, that rais'd them up; that every way accom|plished them for the superior Works and Stations He design'd them for; endow'd them with such admirable Gifts and Graces; inspir'd them with such a publick Zeal and Spirit, Courage, Wisdom, Meekness, Faith and Patience. In fine, that call'd them out and sent them, made them such illustrious Persons, magnified them in the Eyes of all that saw them, prosper'd them in their great Undertakings, and made them so renowned, ad|mired and reverenc'd among all the Nations round about them.</P>
<P>And as it was the LORD that thus <HI>Advanced</HI> MOSES and AARON; It is HE that also <HI>Brought up</HI> the FA|THERS of the Tribes of ISRAEL out of AEGYPT.</P>
<P>This is often indeed ascrib'd in Scripture to those <HI>Two eminent Humane Leaders,</HI> and even this in the Verse immediately following our Text, Because the GOD of Heaven was pleas'd to honour them as Agents under Him, and to put upon them some of his own transcendent Excellence. But MOSES and AARON were only distinguished Instruments, made, accomplish'd and employed by this SOVEREIGN AGENT: And to Him does the pious Preacher therefore justly carry up the Minds of the People, and render Him the Glory of that whole Transaction.</P>
<P>And here we must observe, that the Bringing them out of AEGYPT, implies the Doing it thro' mighty Obstruc|tions, and the surmounting every Difficulty. The <HI>AE|gyptians</HI> were then an independent, great &amp; powerfull 
<PB N="12" REF="003343_0015_0FF7E4A1E2DC5100">
Nation; and utterly averse to let the People go. The Children of ISRAEL were small and feeble in comparison with them; and their Spirits broke and sunk with be|verity, Labour and slavish Usage in the Land of their Affliction. Nor was their Coming out of AEGYPT any other than the Beginning of their Deliverance. For they had a Sea to pass; a great and terrible Wilderness to go thro'; a wast and howling Desert, wherein were fiery Serpents, Scorpions, Drought and Scarcity both of Bread and Water <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. viii. 15. &amp; xxxii. 10.</NOTE>: And they had also to beat their way thro' many mighty Nations, to the Possession of their designed Land.</P>
<P>In short their Case was so perplexed, helpless and desperate, that none cou'd see how they could be deli|vered; the utmost Wit and Power of <HI>Men</HI> were insuffi|cient; And none but GOD cou'd Begin and Carry on the mighty Work, and bring it to Perfection. To MOSES He therefore first appears and says. Exod. iii. 7, 8. <HI>I have surely seen the Affliction of my People in</HI> AEGYPT, <HI>and have heard their Cry by reason of their Task-masters: For I know their Sorrows; and I am come down to de|liver them out of the hand of the</HI> Egyptians, <HI>and to bring them out of that Land unto a Good Land and a large, to a Land flowing with Milk and Honey</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">So Vers. 15&mdash;17. &amp; Ch, vi. 4 to 8&punc;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It wou'd take up too much of the present Hour to mention the particulars of this surprizing History. It wou'd lead us into a vast Field of Wonders, into a per|petual Train of Miracles for above <HI>Forty</HI> Years together. I shall therefore only now give it in this brief Abridg|ment&mdash;</P>
<P>The LORD did great things for this People of his in AEGYPT, wonderous Works in the Land of <HI>Ham,</HI> and terrible things at the Red Sea. Besides the <HI>three</HI> se|veral Judgments we mentioned before, He went on to pour out <HI>seven</HI> others yet heavier than these, till He forced the <HI>Egyptians</HI> to let ISRAEL go. He sent innu|merable swarms of <HI>Insects</HI> among them, which cor|rupted 
<PB N="13" REF="003343_0016_0FF7E4A501B15D68">
the Air and vexed the People. He destroyed their Cattle with <HI>Plagues,</HI> and tormented the Inhabitants with <HI>very sore Diseases.</HI> He thunder'd, lightned and rain'd down <HI>Hail-stones mingled with Fire,</HI> which run along upon the Ground and consumed their Substance. He sent infinite Numbers of <HI>Locusts,</HI> which clouded the Heavens, &amp; devoured the Fruits of the Earth. He wrapt them up in Chains of thick <HI>Darkness,</HI> that they could not stir from their Places. He sent <HI>Evil Angels</HI> among them, and smote all the first Born of their Land.</P>
<P>But he brought forth his People with Joy and his Chosen with Gladness. In the Day time He led them with a Cloud, and all the Night with a Light of Fire. He rebuk'd and divided the RED-SEA, and led them thro' the Depths as thro' the Wilderness. He brought them to Mount SINAI, and shewed them his Glory. He spake aloud to them out of the midst of the burning Flame; and there He gave them his Law, and confirmed his Covenant. He rained Flesh among them as Dust, and feathered Fowls as the Sand of the Sea. He commanded the Clouds from above, and poured down Manna every Night for <HI>Forty</HI> Years. He opened the Rocks in the dry Desart, and the Waters gushed out: The Streams run down and overflowed like Rivers. He set up his beautiful Pavilion among them, and dwelt in a Cloud of Glory between the Cherubims. He mar|ched before them in his Pillar of Light, which in the Day time appeared as a Cloud, in the Night as a Body of Fire, that covered their Camp and cast a Terrour round about. He smote great Nations and slew mighty Kings: and gave their Lands for an Heritage, even an Heritage to ISRAEL his People.</P>
<P>Thus we see how the LORD had Bro't up their FA|THERS out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> as well as advanced MOSES and AARON to lead them; which was the Preliminary <HI>Ob|servation</HI> made by the sacred Orator as the general Ground of his designed Argument.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="003343_0017_0FF7E4ABF7281630">
We proceed to consider&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. The general INFERENCE He derives from thence to excite their close Attention to his Treatment of it; <HI>Now therefore,</HI> STAND STILL, <HI>that I may</HI> REASON <HI>with you before the</HI> LORD, <HI>of all the</HI> RIGHTEOUS ACTS <HI>of the</HI> LORD <HI>which He did to You and to your Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>Herein with a Divine Authority, He therefore now demands their most reverent and devout Attention to the solemn Argumentation He was, in the Holy Pre|sence and Name of GOD, a going to make with them, upon all his righteous Acts, both to Them and their Fathers.</P>
<P>To those more <HI>Ancient</HI> and signal Works of GOD which concern'd the <HI>Raising</HI> up of those admirable Lea|ders, and the <HI>Bringing</HI> up their Fathers out of AEGYPT, the pious Preacher here adds the <HI>other Acts</HI> of the LORD to that destinguished People, as worthy likewise of their most serious Remembrance and Consideration: Both the Works of GOD to them, which their own Eyes had seen; and to their <HI>Fathers,</HI> which they had read or heard of, from their first becoming a separate People to that very Day. He comprehends them all; and He points them out to the Review of all, in the <HI>universal Term:</HI> And for their better Observation and Improve|ment, He calls them <HI>Righteous Acts,</HI> or <HI>Righteous Things</HI> or <HI>Dealings,</HI> as the Word (<HI>for 'tis but One</HI>) may be rendered.</P>
<P>It is by some indeed Translated <HI>Mercies;</HI> by others, <HI>Benefits;</HI> by others, <HI>Judgments:</HI> But other ancient and modern Versions render it by&mdash;<HI>Righteousnesses,</HI> or <HI>Righteous Acts</HI> or <HI>Things</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Bib. Polyg. Pol. Synops. Eng. Marg, &amp;c.</NOTE>. And the word indeed includes them all; as might easily be proved from other Scriptures, and as sufficiently appears by the Preacher's <HI>Instances</HI> He proceeds to mention: For He goes on to recollect both signal Acts of <HI>Judgment</HI> and of <HI>Mercy</HI> to that peculiar People.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="003343_0018_0FF7E4ADD77877F8">
The Word in Scripture is by no means restrained to Works of Judgment, but in general signifies Works of <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and is comprehensive both of <HI>Judgments and Mercies</HI> to a <HI>Covenant</HI> People, as the Tribes of ISRAEL, in a special manner were. For when the Righteous GOD either chastens or visibly shows Favour to such a People, He is in both those Kinds of Dispensations, Righteous: He is just and faithfull to fullfill his Word; and all his Dealings with them are in a just Conformity to his peculiar <HI>Covenant</HI> Relation and Engagements to them.</P>
<P>By these <HI>Righteous</HI> Acts of GOD are therefore meant both <HI>Chastizements</HI> and <HI>Mercies,</HI> and especially those of a publick Nature or signal Observation. And the Pro|phet here wou'd signify; that the LORD in all his Deal|ings with them, had shown Himself a <HI>Righteous</HI> and Faithful GOD, both in bestowing greater Mercies on <HI>Them</HI> than <HI>Others,</HI> and in dispensing more severe Cor|rections when they publickly sinn'd against Him.</P>
<P>What these Righteous Acts in particular were, I may not stay to mention. I may only observe in general, They were on the one hand, very sore <HI>Afflictions</HI> for their Forgetting the GOD of their Fathers; and on the other, wonderfull <HI>Salvations,</HI> upon their humbling themselves before Him and Crying for Mercy.</P>
<P>To the pious <HI>Commemoration</HI> of these does the inspi|red Preacher invite this obliged People. For as He had doubtless observed with Sorrow, how soon they for|got the Works of the LORD, when they had been singing his Praises for his Appearances for them in their Times of Extremity; He wou'd have them know, that those wonderful works both to them and their Fathers, were not meerly to serve a single or transient Occasion, but were also designed for future Benefit. And as they were now partaking in the Influence of them; it be|came them therefore to rise up in their Minds to the original Works themselves, and to that adorable Wis|dom and Goodness, which had in them, a gracious View to their present both temporal and spiritual Ad|vantage, and began the Train which brought them to their present Felicity.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="003343_0019_0FF7E4B3241EB828">
Nor was it meerly the grateful <HI>Remembrance</HI> of these, that the inspired Preacher had in his Eye, but a pious and suitable <HI>Improvement</HI> of it. He would now REA|SON with them of all these Righteous Acts of the LORD both to Them and their Fathers; <HI>i. e.</HI> He would plainly show this People the Divine Ends and Motives in these Works of GOD, with the destinguishing and great Ob|ligations they were thereby laid under to adore &amp; obey Him more than others: He wou'd faithfully show them how unsuitable and sinful their Behaviours had been, with their present eminent and growing Guilt and Danger: And He wou'd earnestly argue with them, of their future Duty, Wisdom and Interest, thence arising.</P>
<P>And all this He wou'd Do <HI>Before the LORD,</HI> in a lively Apprehension of his Presence, citing them to his awful Tribunal, which He represents them as stand|ing now before, with his Holy Eye looking on them: And therefore He requires them, with great Authority, to stand still, be silent, and give Him their most reve|rent and religious Attention.</P>
<P>And thus have we considered the Words as applica|ble to <HI>that particular People</HI> to whom they were at first directed.</P>
<P>We proceed in the</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> place, To raise some <HI>General Observations</HI> from them; which are as so many practical and momentous Lessons they very clearly teach and strongly urge upon us.</P>
<P>And they are plainly such as these&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>When there at any time arise, either in the</HI> Civil <HI>or</HI> Ecclesiastical <HI>Order,</HI> MEN <HI>of eminent Wisdom, Goodness, Power and Usefulness among a</HI> People <HI>of GOD; we must consider, It is the LORD their GOD, that made, accomplished and raised them up, and this in special Favour to that particular People.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That when</HI> such a People <HI>are in a remarkable man|ner Brought out of the Hands of those that vexed them, to a Place or State of</HI> Ease and Liberty; <HI>the 
<PB N="17" REF="003343_0020_0FF7E4B4B8D82F60">
gracious</HI> Conduct <HI>of the LORD their GOD, is herein to be religiously observed and acknowledged by them.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It behoves such a People so treated of GOD, to</HI> Remember <HI>all his signal</HI> Operations, <HI>both of</HI> Judg|ment <HI>and of</HI> Mercy, <HI>both to</HI> Them <HI>and their</HI> Fa|thers, <HI>to view them as Acts of</HI> Faithfulness and Righteousness <HI>to them, and consider the special and great</HI> Obligations <HI>arising from them.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. and lastly, <HI>It becomes their Publick</HI> Teachers <HI>to</HI> Remind <HI>them therefore of all these things, and from thence to</HI> Reason <HI>with them before the LORD about their answerable Carriage towards Him.</HI></P>
<P>All these Articles are so many fair Deductions most naturally rising from the <HI>Text,</HI> or rather so many Doc|trines clearly represented in it. They are the general Grounds themselves upon whioh the inspired Oratour goes in his pathetick Applications to that <HI>Ancient</HI> and highly favoured People. They were the very Reasons of his Publick Addresses to them on that great Occasion. They are as well obliging upon every <HI>other</HI> People of GOD, whom He has treated with signal Favours, Chastizements and Mercies, as well as <HI>those:</HI> And they are therefore written for <HI>Our</HI> Admonition, upon whom the Ends of the World are come.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Difference</HI> we can imagine between <HI>Their Obligations</HI> and the <HI>Obligations</HI> of <HI>Others,</HI> can only rise from this; That the Works of the LORD for <HI>Them</HI> were of a <HI>miraculous</HI> Nature, they were the visible Ope|rations of GOD beside the Course of natural Causes; whereas his Righteous Acts for <HI>Others</HI> are done in a more veiled way, by his invisible tho' real Influence on ma|terial and intellectual Agents, according to the Course of <HI>Nature,</HI> which is nothing else but his usual manner of acting and ruling the World.</P>
<P>But if we search these things exactly, we may clearly see, that the Obligations in both these Cases, are either the same, or at least nearly equal.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="003343_0021_0FF7E4BB70E4C4F8">
For let us here consider, that the Great GOD might if He pleas'd not only have rais'd up MOSES and AARON, but also brought up his People out of AEGYPT, led them thro' the neighbouring Countries, given them the Victory over their Enemies, and put them in the Pos|session of CANAAN, by his Operations in the Course of <HI>Nature,</HI> as well as by a continual Train of <HI>Miracles.</HI></P>
<P>There was no Necessity <HI>in the Nature of Things,</HI> that any of those Wonders should be wro't in AEGYPT, in order to make the <HI>Egyptians</HI> willing to let the People go: He might have raised such an Hatred in the <HI>AEgyp|tians</HI> towards them, as that <HI>Pharaoh</HI> might rather in Displeasure have banish'd or commanded them to get out of the Kingdom. No necessity they shou'd go thro' the Sea, or that the mighty Waters should be divided for them: There was another and a near Passage by Land, and they even took a circular March to go to the Sea. No necessity they should travel thro' the terrible Wilderness: They might have gone a much shorter and easier way in beaten Roads by the sides of Towns and Ci|ties, from whence they might have had Supplies of Bread &amp; Water. No necessity of their Journeying <HI>Forty</HI> Years in the Desart: It was but about <HI>Two Hundred</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I take this Account from the Map in the Apparatus of the POLYGLOT BIBLE; where the Way is measured as running between the Ranges of Mountains, and amounts to SEVENTY Horary Miles, which is the same as Leagues with us. And MO|SES tells us, there were but ELEVEN Days Journey from HOREB to KADESH-BARNEA which say on the Southern Border of CA|NAAN, Deut. I. 2.</NOTE> Miles from the RED SEA to the Southern Border of CANAAN. No necessity of a Pillar of Fire to Guide them: MOSES was a great Mathematician, Historian and Geographer, and the Scituations of the Countries about them were perfectly known. No necessity of dividing the Waters of JORDAN: They went a great way about to get to the River. In fine, no necessity of Miraculous Victories: For GOD might in the Course of Nature have swept away the People of CANAAN, either with wasting Wars or Plagues, and emptied the Land of almost all it's In|habitants: 
<PB N="19" REF="003343_0022_0FF7E4BF6A53EC18">
Or when they came to fight with a numerous Host of the most powerful Nations combined against them; He might either have set them a contending to|gether, or have struck their Minds with Fear, or have rais'd such a violent Tempest of Wind and Hail to beat in their Faces at the first of the Battle, as to bear them away before the Armies of ISRAEL.</P>
<P>Or instead of these and many other natural Cau|ses, He might have accomplished it all by this one <HI>easy</HI> Course of his Providence; (<HI>easy I mean for us to conceive</HI>)&mdash;The Royal Family of AEGYPT being with|out a Male-Heir; He might have made both <HI>Pharaoh'</HI>s <HI>Daughter</HI> and the other <HI>AEgyptians</HI> so fond of the wise and excellent MOSES her adopted Son, as to raise Him to the Throne, upon the King's Decease; And then MOSES might send a powerful Army, to make way for the Tribes of ISRAEL, to bare down all Opposition before them, and put them into the Possession of CA|NAAN.</P>
<P>And now, If the sovereign GOD, in the midst of their sore Oppression, Anguish and Dispair, had appear'd to some of their Elders and said,&mdash;<Q>I have heard the Groaning of the Children of ISRAEL, whom the <HI>AE|gyptians</HI> keep in Bondage, and I will soon deliver and bring them into the Land of CANAAN. I will set the Nations there to fight against and destroy each other, and I will send wasting Plagues among the Survivors, till they are almost consumed. And then I will raise such an Aversion in the <HI>AEgyptians</HI> to You, as they will even drive You out of their Coun|try. And the Nations remaining in CANAAN shall thro' Enmity among themselves be indisposed and un|able to combine against you: And those that agree, shall be struck with Terror when they come to the Battle. But I will give you Courage; and in their last and most united Effort, I will raise up a furious Storm of Wind and Hail, that shall beat in their Faces as they begin the Fight, and make them fly before You, And You shall destroy them and take their Land for your own Inheritance.&mdash;Or, <HI>that little Infant</HI> MOSES, which now lies crying in the 
<PB N="20" REF="003343_0023_0FF7E4C3D5824578">
Flags of <HI>Nilus,</HI> and is doom'd by the King to Die, shall be quickly found by his own Daughter, adop|ted by Her, brought up with Her, raised to the Throne of EGYPT; And He shall send a mighty Ar|my with You, that shall Conduct You with Triumph to CANAAN, destroy and expell the Nations there, and put You into the Possession of the Land.</Q></P>
<P>And if these things were soon to come to pass ac|cordingly, wou'd not they all appear to be the <HI>Opera|tions</HI> of GOD, tho' they were brought about agreable to the <HI>Course of Nature?</HI> wou'd not their Deliverance out of AEGYPT and their Entrance into CANAAN be as truly the <HI>Works</HI> of the LORD, and as happy to ISRAEL, as if they were accomplished in a way beside the usual way of his acting? Or wou'd not these Works of GOD have been exactly the same in themselves, and as happy in the end to the People, tho' He had never declared his Designs before-hand, as if He had given a previous Discovery of them?</P>
<P>And these beneficent Acts of GOD being the same, wrought by the same Wisdom, Power and Goodness in this particular way of his acting in the Course of Na|ture, as well as in the other beside it, having the same benevolent Design, and the same happy Influence in their Operation&mdash;They very nearly, if not equally <HI>Oblige</HI> his People, to Adore Him and be Grateful to Him, to Love and Fear Him, to Obey and Honour Him, and to keep in Mind the lively Memory both of his Re|markable Works of Providence, and their continued Ob|ligations to Him for them.</P>
<P>And as a <HI>Confirmation</HI> of all this; Tho' the Holy PROPHET hints at the <HI>extraordinary</HI> and miraculous Works of GOD for ISRAEL in the <HI>Verse</HI> immediately following our Text; yet in the <HI>Rest</HI> of his Sermon, He only mentions the Righteous Acts of the LORD towards them according to the <HI>ordinary</HI> Course of Na|ture&mdash;As his suffering their Enemies to prevail against and oppress them for their heinous Sins, and his work|ing out their Deliverance and Safety upon their penitent 
<PB N="21" REF="003343_0024_0FF7E4C7912AAF10">
and earnest Supplications: And from <HI>these Ordinary</HI> Acts of GOD, the Prophet <HI>Reasons</HI> with the People they immediately concerned.</P>
<P>Having said thus much to clear our <HI>Observations,</HI> it is needless to endeavour further to enlighten them. We therefore now go on to the&mdash;</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> and last general Head, which is to <HI>Apply</HI> the Words and those Observations to <HI>this Particular Peo|ple</HI> in our own Land.</P>
<P>And here I cannot forbear observing, that there never was any People on Earth, so parallel in their general History to that of the ancient ISRAELITES as this of NEW-ENGLAND. To no other Country of People cou'd there ever be so directly applied a Multitude of Scripture Passages in the literal Sense, as to this parti|cular Country: that excepting <HI>Miracles</HI> and chang|ing <HI>Names,</HI> one wou'd be ready to think, the greater Part of the OLD TESTAMENT were written about <HI>us;</HI> or that <HI>we,</HI> tho' in a lower Degree, were the particular Antitypes of that primitive People.</P>
<P>However, I'm sure, that upon the <HI>present Occasion,</HI> I may justly turn the <HI>Text</HI> into a like <HI>Address,</HI> in the Name of GOD, to this <HI>Great and General Assembly,</HI> comprehensive both of Rulers and People of every Or|der; and say,&mdash;<HI>It is the LORD that</HI> advanced <HI>your Primitive Civil &amp; Ecclesiastical</HI> LEADERS, <HI>and that</HI> brought up <HI>your</HI> FATHERS <HI>out of the Land of their Affliction; Now therefore, stand still, that I may</HI> Reason <HI>with you before the LORD, of all the</HI> Righ|teous Acts <HI>of the LORD, which He did to</HI> YOU <HI>and to your</HI> FATHERS!</P>
<P>And how extreamly proper is it, upon the Close of the FIRST CENTURY of our <HI>Settlement</HI> in <HI>this chief Part of the Land,</HI> which will now within a

In the same Month the Governour, Deputy Governour &amp; Assistants came with their Goods to CHARLESTOWN: And the first Court of Assistants was held There on Aug. 23, the same Year.</NOTE> To look back to the Beginning of this remarkable Transaction; and first Commemorate the Righteous and Signal <HI>Works</HI> of GOD towards us, both in our own Days and in the Days of our Fathers; and then consider the great &amp; special Ob|ligations they have laid upon us, with the Nature of our Carriage towards Him for the time past, and our Interest and Wisdom for the future.</P>
<P><Q>Give ear therefore O my People to my Law: incline your Ear to the Words of my Mouth! I will utter things of old, which we have heard and known and our Fathers have told us. We will not hide them from their Children; shewing to the Generation and Century coming on, the Praises of the LORD, and his Strength, and his Wonder|ful WORKS that He has done. For He established a Testimony in JACOB, and appointed a Law, <HI>a Law of Gratitude</HI> in ISRAEL, which He com|manded our Fathers, that they should make known the WORKS of GOD to their Children: that the Generation to come might know them, even the Children which should be born, who should arise and declare them to <HI>their</HI> Children; that <HI>they</HI> might also set their Hope in GOD, and not for|get his Works, but keep his Commandments.</Q></P>
<P>And here we must own, that very many have been the wonderous WORKS which the LORD our GOD has wrought for us: they cannot be reckoned up in order before Him: if I would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered. We may now therefore only touch on some of the most 
<PB N="23" REF="003343_0026_0FF7E4D02DE2D380">
material; those of the most important, publick and comprehensive Nature.</P>
<P>And 1st, Let us consider Who the FATHERS of these Plantations were, and what were their destinguishing Characters; that we may give to GOD the Glory of the excellent Honour He was pleas'd to put upon them, and see our own Obligations to Him for deriving us from such eminent Ancestors.</P>
<P>For the Generality of them&mdash;They were the near <HI>De|scendants</HI> of the first <HI>Reformers</HI> in ENGLAND. They were born of pious Parents, who brought them up in a Course of strict Religion, and under the Ministry of the most awakening Preachers of those Days. Like so many <HI>Timothies,</HI> they were from their Childhood taught to know the HOLY SCRIPTURES, to reverence them as the Inspirations of GOD, as the only Rule of Faith and Piety, and to aim at both a pure scriptural way of Wor|ship, and at the vital Power and Practice of Godliness: And they continued in the things they had learned and had been assured of, as knowing of whom they had lear|ned them.</P>
<P>Under such Means as these they became inspired with a Spirit of Piety, and with a growing Zeal to reform the <HI>Worship</HI> of GOD to the most beautiful and perfect Mo|del of his own Institutions.</P>
<P>In Points of <HI>Doctrine,</HI> they entirely held with the <HI>Church</HI> of ENGLAND, their Judgment of <HI>Orthodoxy</HI> be|ing the very same: But they apprehended it to be the sole Prerogative of GOD Himself, and a Glory that He would not give to another, To appoint the Orders of his own House, and the acceptable Ways of his own Wor|ship: That RELIGION <HI>is a free Obedience to the known Laws of GOD;</HI> and it is neither in the Power of Men or Angels, to make that Religion which He has not made so Himself: That His own Institutions ought not to be set on a Level, mixed or debased with the low Devices of Men; and that it is a plain, full and decisive <HI>Rule</HI> of his own Injunction&mdash;<HI>To the</HI> LAW <HI>and to the</HI> TESTI|MONY; 
<PB N="24" REF="003343_0027_0FF7E4D5E8245E00">
<HI>if they speak not according to</HI> THIS WORD, <HI>it is because there is no light in them.</HI></P>
<P>This is the <HI>Pure Religion</HI> which our Father's ad|mir'd and aim'd at, and at nothing in Religion but what was inspir'd of GOD. This and nothing else, they earnestly breath'd and laboured after: But for la|bouring after it, tho' some of the most pious on Earth, they were censured, pursued, seized, imprisoned, fined, and suffered a World of Hardship not now to be named.</P>
<P>Their native Country, which ever since the Glori|ous <HI>Revolution,</HI> has been an happy Land of Ease and Liberty, was in those former Times as the Land of AEGYPT to those Pious Men; and their Lives were made exceeding bitter with Religious Bondage.</P>
<P>However, thro' the infinite Mercy and Wisdom of GOD, it was well for our <HI>Fathers,</HI> and for <HI>Us,</HI> in the End, that they were thus afflicted. For had there been then a Succession of such indulgent PRINCES and <HI>Bishops</HI> in ENGLAND, as there have since the PRINCE of ORANGE ascended the Throne; there never had been such a Countrey as <HI>This,</HI> for Religion, good Order, Liberty, Learning and flourishing Towns and Churches; which have given us a destinguishing Name in the World, and have reflected a singular Honour to the Persons and Principles of it's original <HI>Setlers</HI> for this <HI>Hundred Years.</HI> But having a rougher Surface, a barrenner Soil, a more inclement Air than the Southern Countries; it wou'd in all humane Prospect, have been at this Day as the Wasts of NEW-SCOTLAND or the wilder Desarts between us, but abundantly fuller of barbarous Natives; or at most in no better Condition than the bordering Plantations.</P>
<P>But the omniscient and sovereign GOD had espied and chosen this Land for our Fathers, for a Refuge and He|ritage for them and their Children; that here they might set up his Worship and Churches according to the in|spired Pattern, behold the Beauty of the Divine Appoint|ments 
<PB N="25" REF="003343_0028_0FF7E4D76FF44690">
in their Scriptural Purity, &amp; leave these inestimable Privileges, which they justly preferred above all things else in the World, as a Blessed Inheritance to their Posterity, as we see at this Day.</P>
<P>And now let us look back and behold in what a re|markable manner, the GOD of our Fathers was pleased to Bring them out of the Land of their Sorrows, to this far distant and quiet Recess of the Earth, and put it into their Hands.</P>
<P>First, He sends a <HI>smaller Company</HI> into a <HI>neighbouring State</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><ABBR>Viz.</ABBR> Into Holland in 1610.</NOTE>; that there they might form themselves into a regular Ecclesiastical Body, till this hidden Part of the Earth shou'd appear to the Light, and yet come under such a discouraging Character, that none but Men inspir'd with a Zeal for <HI>Religion</HI> would go on to settle it. He disappoints the successive Endeavours of others who came hither only out of secular Views, till the Country comes to be given up and abandoned as not worthy the look|ing after by any Trading Nation. And then He sends both wasting Diseases among the native Inhabitants, and fierce Contentions among the Survivors, that greatly diminished their Numbers, and made Room for his Peo|ple.</P>
<P>But O how <HI>horrid and dismal</HI> do these New found Regions appear! On the Shoars and Rivers, nothing but Sights of wretched, naked and barbarous Nations, Adorers of Devils&mdash;The Earth covered with hideous Thickets, that require infinite Toils to subdue&mdash;A rigorous Winter for a third Part of the Year&mdash;Not a House to live in&mdash;Not a Christian to see&mdash;None but Heathen of a strange and hard Language to speak with&mdash;Not a Friend within <HI>Three Thousand</HI> Miles to help in any Emergency&mdash;and a vast and dangerous Ocean to pass over to this!</P>
<P>But the ALMIGHTY inspires with a Zeal and Cou|rage that nothing can daunt, with a Faith and Patience

<P>And now, at once, to the Surprize of the Nation, in almost every Corner they are moved of GOD to look to this part of the Wilderness He had been preparing for them.

At first indeed, they met with very grievour <HI>Trials,</HI> and endur'd a World of <HI>Hardship</HI> and <HI>Affliction:</HI> For tho' the LORD had thus Redeem'd and gather'd them out of other Lands, and bro't them hither; yet here they had only <HI>solitary Ways</HI> and <HI>Thickets</HI> to wander thro', and no Towns or Houses to receive or cover them. Those who before had liv'd in the midst of Plenty and Delights, now greatly suffer for want of Lodging, Bread, and Defence from Weather. Hungry and Thirsty, their Souls fainted in them. They are Wet with the Showers of the Mountains, and embrace the Rocks for Shelter. They quickly sink their worldly Substance; they are forc'd to give their pleasant Things for Meat to relieve the Soul; and many of their Wives and Children expire about them.&mdash;But they endure with Patience, and cry to GOD, and He sends Relief. He satisfies their long|ing Souls and filleth them with Goodness. He builds them Houses and Towns for Habitation; He prepares them Fields for Planting, and He turns the Desart into a fruitful Land. He increas'd their Cattle; and He blessed their Persons, so that they multiplied greatly, and He made them Families and Churches round about.</P>
<P>And now the WILDERNESS and the solitary Place is Glad for them: The Desart rejoices and blossoms as a Rose; it blossoms abundantly with Peace and Righte|ousness; it rejoices with Joy and Singing. The Glory of LEBANON is given to it, the Excellency of CARMEL and SHARON; they see the Glory of the LORD and the Excellency of our GOD. The Waters of the Di|vine Influence break out in the Wilderness, and the Streams in the Desart: The parched Ground becomes a Pool; and the thirsty Land, Springs of Water: In the Habitations of Dragons where they lay, there grows up the Grass; and an High Way now is there, which is call'd the <HI>Way of Holiness,</HI> over which the Unclean do not pass, and the Wayfaring Men do not err therein.</P>

And here, in the first Place then we see what a surpassing <HI>Favour and Honour,</HI> the MOST HIGH has shown to this particular People in our first For|mation, and so down to this Day. He form'd us of a pious People, devoted to Him; and He brought them and their Offspring into a special, open, express and solemn COVENANT with Him. They began with <HI>this,</HI> and <HI>this</HI> has been successively laid in the Foundation of every Church, and explicitly own'd at the Admi|nistration of every Sacrament, and at the Admission of every Member.</P>
<P>Now the Substance of this COVENANT is, <HI>That HE will deal with Us, and We will carry to HIM, according to his</HI> INSPIRED WORD. The SA|CRED SCRIPTURES, the Promises and Threatnings exhibited in them, are the declared Rule of his Dis|pensations to us; and the same Divine Writings, the Doctrines and Injunctions represented in them, are the professed Rule of our Carriage to Him. This is the Rule and the only Rule for the People, Churches and Religion of NEW-ENGLAND. We hold to nothing but what we apprehend to be revealed, taught and required in them; and we leave every one to search and judge for themselves.</P>
<P>By our sacred Covenant, we are therefore under the most solemn Obligations to preserve an intire and strict Adherence to this DIVINE STANDARD, both in Be|lief and Practice, both in Life and Worship: And Wo unto us, if we depart there from! For if we do&mdash;We break our Covenant with the Holy GOD, and become expos'd to all the fearful and signal <HI>Judgments</HI> denounc'd in Scripture upon the Violaters of it; and He is a True and Jealous GOD, and will signally avenge the Quarrel of his broken Covenant. But if we faith|fully keep to this Holy Engagement, then we are en|tituled to all the destinguishing <HI>Promises</HI> which GOD has made to his Covenant People; and He is a Gra|cious and a Faithful GOD, and will surely fulfill them for us.</P>

Mr. MITCHEL speaking of them in his Election Sermon in 1667, observes, that <HI>"That was the</HI> 37th <HI>Year Currant with the</HI> MASSACHUSETTS <HI>Colony</HI> [I may add&mdash;the 47th then with PLYMOUTH] <HI>that GOD had given them Godly Magistrates</HI>&mdash;And that <HI>the Sun did not shine upon an happier People than they were, in regard of this Mercy.".</HI> And Mr. OAKES in his Election Sermon, in 1673&mdash;<HI>"Many and won|derful are the</HI> Favours and Privileges <HI>which the LORD your GOD hath conferred upon You. As to your</HI> CIVIL GOVERNMENT; <HI>You have had</HI> MOSES, <HI>Men I mean of the same</HI> Spirit, <HI>to lead and go before You: The LORD hath not given Children to be your Leaders</HI>&mdash;<HI>but</HI> Pious, Faithful, Prudent Magistrates, <HI>Men in</HI> Wis|dom and Understanding&mdash;<HI>Men of</HI> Nehemiah's <HI>Spirit, that sought not themselves, but sincerely design'd the Good, and consulted the Welfare and Prosperity of these Plantations&mdash;Men that did not rigorously ex|act the Bread of the Governour, but cheerfully re|ceeded from their own Right, sympathizing with, and compassionately considering the low Estate and Condi|tion of this People.</HI>&mdash;Good Magistrates, good Laws, <HI>and the</HI> vigorous Execution of them, <HI>hath been the</HI> Privilege and Glory <HI>of</HI> NEW-ENGLAND, <HI>wherein You have been advanced above most of the Nations of the Earth."</HI></P>
<P>In fine, They faithfully serv'd their Generation ac|cording to the Will of GOD: They were greatly con|cern'd for the Religon and Welfare of their Posterity: They now enjoy the glorious Fruits of all their Ser|vices, and have left their excellent Examples for those to follow who should rise up in their Places, as You are this Day.</P>
<P>We the Ministers and People account it happy, that we see so many in Place of Publick Power, descending from the ancient Founders of these Towns and Churches, and others, in such a measure like them, in exalted Sta|tions. We also esteem it a joyful Smile of Heaven, that our most Gracious KING has given us <HI>Principal Rulers</HI> out of <HI>Our Selves;</HI> Men of known Virtue, and
<PB N="41" REF="003343_0044_0FF7E51E469AEEE8">
well acquainted with our Constitution, Genius, Cir|cumstance, and chief Concern and Interest. And the late surprizing Turn of Providence in Favour to this dis|stressed People, fills us with humble Adorations of the Sovereign Power and Government of GOD; and gives us such raised Apprehensions of the gracious Disposi|tions of our KING and QUEEN to favour us, as both inspires us with universal Joy and Gratitude, and also assures us, that YOUR HONOURS will best please their Majesties, by pursuing your own Inclinations to render us an easy and happy People.</P>
<P>And how is it imaginable that this can be better done, than by following the destinguishing Examples of the ancient <HI>Fathers of this Country;</HI> by whose au|spicious Conduct, this Plantation grew and flourished under many Disadvantages, without any Expence or Help from the Crown, and soon out-strip'd all others in Virtue, Learning, Power and Figure, tho' not in Riches.</P>
<P>Let our MINISTERS likewise call to mind and imi|tate, the <HI>Burning and Shining Lights</HI> that were first set up in this dismal Wilderness.</P>
<P>Instead of my drawing their exalted Character, I would rather give it in the more authentick Terms of those who personally knew them. They are the joint and expiring Testimony of the venerable and aged Mr. HIGGINSON and HUBBARD <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. WILLIAM HUBBARD of Ipswich.</NOTE> in the Year 1701.</P>
<P>"<HI>Above</HI> Seventy <HI>Years</HI> [say they] <HI>have passed away, since One of Us; and above</HI> Sixty <HI>since the Other of us came into</HI> NEW-ENGLAND&mdash;<HI>We are therefore capable to make some Comparison between the Condition of the Churches when they were first erected in this Country, and the Condition into which they are now fallen and more falling every Day&mdash;We that saw the</HI> Per|sons, <HI>who from</HI> Four famous Colonies, <HI>assembled in the</HI> SYNOD, <HI>that agreed on our</HI> Platform of Church-Disci|pline,
<PB N="42" REF="003343_0045_0FF7E52172FD92D8">
<HI>cannot forget their excellent Character. They were Men of great Renown in the Nation, from whence the</HI> Laudean <HI>Persecution exiled them: Their Learning, their Holiness, their Gravity struck all Men that knew them with Admiration. They were</HI> Timothies <HI>in their Houses,</HI> Chrysostomes <HI>in their Pulpits,</HI> Augustines <HI>in their Disputations. The Prayers, the Studies, the hum|ble Enquiries, with which they sought after the Mind of GOD, were as likely to Prosper as any Men's upon Earth. And the Sufferings wherein they were Confessors for the Name and Truth of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, add unto the Arguments which would perswade us, that our Gracious LORD would Reward and Honour them with communicating much of his Truth unto them. The famous</HI> BRIGHTMAN <HI>had foretold,</HI> Clariorem Lucem adhuc Solitudo dabit; <Q><HI>GOD would yet reveal more of the true Church-State to some of his faithful Servants, whom He would send into a</HI> Wilder|ness, <HI>that He might there have Communion with Them. And it was eminently accomplished in what was done for and by the Men of GOD, that first erected</HI> Chur|ches <HI>for Him in this</HI> American <HI>Wilderness.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus those two ancient Witnesses, who brought up the Rear of the first Generation that came from ENG|LAND.</P>
<P>Indeed the inspired SCRIPTURE, as was observ'd before, is our only Authoritative Rule of Faith and Worship: and our <HI>Platform</HI> is no other than the de|clared Judgment of the Sense of Scripture in matters of Church Order, Discipline and Worship which our an|cient <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>Others</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I say OTHERS; Because it has been a Fundamental Prin|ciple with us, that as CHURCHES are composed both of MINI|STERS and BRETHREN; and Ecclesiastical Councils or Synods are proper Representatives of Churches; that therefore there should set in all such Assemblies, not only MINISTERS, but also OTHERS chosen by the Churches to represent them: That they may not be merely CLERICAL, or Synods of the CLERGY, but ECCLESIATICAL, or Synode of the CHURCHES. And such have been all our NEW-ENGLAND Synods and Councils from the First; agreeable to that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Precedent in Acts. xv.</NOTE>, with abundant Prayers
<PB N="43" REF="003343_0046_0FF7E52581DE3DB0">
and humble, free and diligent Enquiries and Conferen|ces, almost unanimously came into. But then as no other People in these later Ages have been favoured with such <HI>Advantages</HI> as the Founders of these Churches, to search into, discover and put in Practice the Christian Way of Church-Order, Discipline and Worship described in the WORD of GOD; they being intirely Men of Piety, Knowledge, Judgment, the most about the mid|dle Age of Life, who had made the <HI>Bible</HI> their familiar Study, many of them Persons of Superiour Learning, and all free from any Influence of Humane Powers and Constitutions in Religious Matters; they wholly relin|quish'd all devised Scheams of Men, and set themselves to consult the Sacred SCRIPTURES <HI>only,</HI> that they might happily see what these directed, and submit thereto; and having renounced all Prospects of worldly Riches, Pow|ers and Dignities, for this very End.&mdash;They were on these accounts most likely to find out the Truth in those Affairs. And tho' our <HI>Faith</HI> is not to be sub|jected to <HI>Their</HI> Judgment, but <HI>We</HI> should also humbiy, sincerely and carefully <HI>Search the</HI> SCRIPTURES, and try these things by <HI>Them,</HI> and see whether they are conformable to those Oracles of GOD or no, as the noble BER<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ANS did when even the APOSTLES taught them; yet the <HI>Result</HI> of their united, pious, anxious and laborious Enquiries, under such Advantages, demands a very extraordinary <HI>Veneration</HI> from all impartial Men, and especially from us their dear Posterity.</P>
<P>And can we do any thing better, both for the Ad|vantage of our Ministry, the Satisfaction of our People, and the Quiet of our Churches, than to go on upon the <HI>Scriptural Foundations</HI> these excellent Men have already laid? not to set aside, or build anew, but to go on fur|ther as the Light of Scripture leads us, for our common Peace and Edification. And I know of nothing of grea|ter moment, than to <HI>advise to Methods about calling Councils</HI> in a fairer, more peaceable, equal and har|monious manner, than we are now unhappily liable to; that so this sacred Ordinance may not be so sub|ject to be frustrated by the dark Intreagues of crafty Men, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">or Anti-Councils rais'd to support contending Parties, 
<PB N="44" REF="003343_0047_0FF7E5281E723080">
to the great Dishonour of CHRIST, the Grief of all good Men, and the Inflammation and Continuance of Hatred and Divisions.</P>
<P>And how happy for these <HI>Churches,</HI> and for all this Country both to this and future Generations, as I would with Submission hope, if with the Countenance and <HI>Invi|tation</HI> of our CIVIL FATHERS, we might have a SY|NOD in due time Convened: not to make the least In|junctions upon any, which is contrary to our known Principles, but only to <HI>advise and propose</HI> those Me|thods which may conduce to the promoting Piety, Peace and Good Order in our own Churches; but left to every one to receive or not, as they think best. <HI>Two</HI> such happy <HI>Synods</HI> we had in the Reign of King CHARLES I. and <HI>two more</HI> in the Reign of King CHARLES II, without Offence; invited by the Civil Rulers, who also sat among them as chosen Represen|tatives of our Churches, and as grave Advisers with the Rest, but all without the least coercive Power. Even the <HI>Protestants</HI> in FRANCE were often allowed by their Kings to meet in <HI>Synods,</HI> and Benevolences given them out of the Royal Treasury. Nor can we think HIS MAJESTY can be displeased with us, if He were to know, that our <HI>New-England Synods</HI> are not like those of other Countries, to make Decrees or Canons, but for <HI>Coun|sel only,</HI> for the Peace and Order of the Churches who send their Pastors and other Delegates to Consult to|gether and give their free Advices: And that as <HI>no Au|thority</HI> is or ever was put forth by our Civil Rulers by <HI>deriving</HI> any Power to such a Synod, or in <HI>inviting</HI> the Churches to them, the Churches being always left at Liberty whether to send or no, to comply or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">; there can be <HI>no Invasion</HI> on any Power in such a <HI>free Invitation:</HI> it being impossible as I humbly apprehend, there should be any Power invaded, where there is none assumed.</P>
<P>In fine, Let THE PEOPLE <HI>in General,</HI> both now and frequently look back to their excellent <HI>Forefathers,</HI> and labour after that Spirit of Grace and Prayer, of Purity and Charity, of Zeal for GOD and Love to Men, which dwelt so eminently in them.</P>

And that we may know something more concerning them; Let us hear that great and immortal Honour of his Country, Mr. WILLIAM STOUGHTON, in his Elec|tion Sermon in 1668, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Then a PREACHER of the Gospel in Dorchester: But Three Years after Chosen a MAGISRTATE of the MASSACHUSETTS COLONY: And afterwards made by King WILLIAM and Queen MARY of ever Glorious Memory&mdash;LIEUT, GOVERNOUR and Commander in Chief of this PROVINCE.</NOTE> who liv'd among them.</P>

What was their Hu|mility, their Mortification, their Exemplariness? How much of</HI> Holiness to the LORD <HI>was written upon all their Ways and Transactions?

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P><HI>To fill up these vacant Pages, I take leave to insert the following Passages from Mr.</HI> STOUGHTON'S <HI>Election Sermon,</HI> April 29. 1668.</P>
<Q><P><HI>_AS for special Relation unto GOD;</HI> Whom hath the LORD more signally exalted than his People in this Wilderness? The Name and Interest of GOD, and Cove|nant-Relation to him, it hath been written upon us in Capital Letters from the beginning. GOD had his <HI>Creatures</HI> in this Wilderness before we came, and his <HI>Rational Creatures</HI> too, yea a multitude of them; but as to <HI>Sons</HI> and <HI>Children</HI> that are Covenant-born unto GOD, Are not we the <HI>first</HI> in such a Relation? In this respect we are surely the LORD's <HI>first-born</HI> in this Wilderness. Of the poor Natives before we came, we may say as Isa. 63. 19. <HI>They were not called by the LORD's Name, He bear not Rule over them:</HI> But we have been from the beginning, and we are the LORD's.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>As for Restipulations,</HI> and Engagements back again to GOD, what awful publick Transactions of this kind have there been amongst us? Hath not his Ear heard us solemnly <HI>Avouching</HI> him, and him alone, to be our GOD and Saviour? Hath not a great part of the World been a Witness of these things, even of our explicite Ownings of, and Covenantings with the LORD as our GOD, laying this as a foundation-stone in our Building? And of this we may say, It hath been a special Exasperation unto Adversaries and Ill-willers, that despised <HI>New-England</HI> hath laid Claim to, and publickly avouched and challenged a special Interest in God above others.</P>
<P><HI>As for our Advantages and Priviledges</HI> in a Co|venant-state; here time and strength would fail to reckon up what we have enjoyed of this kind: If any People in the World have been lifted up to Heaven as to Advantages and Priviledges, we are the 
<PB REF="003343_0053_0FF7E53D40CD94E8">
People. Name what you will under this Head, and we have had it. We have had <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> to lead us; we have had Teachings and Instructions, <HI>line upon line, and precept upon precept;</HI> we have had Ordinances and Gospel-dispensations the choicest of them; we have had Peace &amp; Plenty; we have had Af|flictions and Chastisements in measure; we have had the Hearts and Prayers and Blessing of the LORD's People every where; we have had the Eye &amp; Hand of GOD, watching and working every way for our Good; our Adversaries have had their Rebukes, we have had our Encouragements, and a Wall of Fire round about us. What could have been done more for us than hath been done?&mdash;</P>
<P>What the LORD expects from us is, not any thing of <HI>doubtful Disputation,</HI> not meerly Civils or Pru|dentials; but the sure and certain, the often acknow|ledged, and stated, common Interest of the People of GOD, and of you the LORD's People in special; The Interest of practical Piety and Holiness;&mdash;The Inte|rest of unmixed, spiritual Gospel-Worship, and of the sincere and open Profession and owning of the Truths and Ways of CHRIST;&mdash;The Interest of Unity and Peace in the ways of Reformation, and of expecting and waiting for the Issue of all those great and astonishing Providences that are working every where; The In|terest of these Things, and of just and righteous Li|berties in order hereunto, is all that which I intend. The Times are come, and hastning more and more, wherein Faithfulness to GOD in all these things, will be the most glorious Crown that can be worn upon Earth; A Crown upon which it shall be graven, <HI>Here is the Faith and Patience of the Saints.</HI> This then is the word of the LORD unto his <HI>New-England</HI> Churches and People this Day, <HI>Let no Man take your Crown from you;</HI> No Temptations, no Corruptions, no Insinuations, no Threatnings, no Fears, no Ad|versaries.&mdash;</P>
<P>And this we must know, that&mdash;<HI>He that is not with CHRIST is against him;&mdash;He that ga|thereth 
<PB REF="003343_0054_0FF7E5421CD17100">
thereth not with CHRIST, scattereth abroad;</HI> we must declare for whom we are, and Choose our side. We indeed of these Ends of the Earth have long since made our Choice; we have given up our selves to the LORD <HI>JESUS</HI> as to our <HI>Spiritual King and Lawgiver,</HI> to be his Portion and Inheritance: Now that which the LORD expects is, that we stick to this our Choice; that we give not back a whit, so as to become <HI>Liars</HI> unto that GOD who unto us hath not been as <HI>Waters that fail.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Take heed of and watch against all the <HI>various Steps, Degrees, Methods</HI> whereby Men come to <HI>for|sake and turn off</HI> from the LORD and his Ways. 1. Men use the Ordinances of GOD <HI>slightly and carelesly.</HI>&mdash;Church-watch, Fellowship, Discipline does them no real inward Good. 2. Now Men grow secretly <HI>weary</HI> of all these things, as of a Garment that warms not, and Bread that strengthens not&mdash;3. Now Men begin to <HI>question the Ground &amp; Warrant of Things.</HI> 4. Now they hearken after <HI>Objections,</HI> and what may be <HI>cavill'd against</HI> the Ways and Instituti|of GOD. 5. Now they are <HI>impos'd upon by deceit|ful Workers,</HI> they <HI>greedily</HI> listen unto what may be said <HI>for</HI> the Ways and Institutions, Courses &amp; Customs of Men. 6. Now they <HI>take Offence</HI> at Persons and Things, and suffer their Spirits to be imbittered. 7. Now being <HI>given up by GOD,</HI> they <HI>fall quite off; Men gather them,</HI> they are joined in with the Instru|ments of Satan, and turn <HI>Underminers</HI> at least, if not <HI>open Persecutors.</HI> O take heed and watch against all these Things. Enquire after all the <HI>first Warpings</HI> of your Hearts and Spirits; Be not <HI>Ignorant of Satan's Devices.</HI></P></Q>
