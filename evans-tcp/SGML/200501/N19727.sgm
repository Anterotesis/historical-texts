<P>MODESTY and self diffidence are the allowed characteristicks of <HI>self knowl|edge.</HI> If then my presuming to address this piece to you may seem to discover more assurance and self confidence than becomes a true acquaintance with the subject I write upon, I have only this to say&mdash;your known condescension and candour have encourag|ed
<PB N="iv" REF="025769_0004_0FCF12E7B6ED7E30">
that presumption: Nor can any thing animate an address of this nature more, than an assurance that the person to whom it is made, has so good an understanding in the practical part of this subject as will incline <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to excuse the defects that may appear in the management of it.</P>
<P>BUT after all SIR, my own proficiency in this science is so poor, that I dare not be confident I am not wrong in my views, with which I desire this small tract may ap|pear under your patronage. That it may have refuge from the petulance of censure, an encouragement in the publication, and I at the same time, an opportunity of tes|tifying my grateful sense of many past fav|ours, are my open and avowed ends here|in. But still, whether an ambition to be known to the world under the advantage of your friendship be not the secret and true motive, I cannot be certain.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, if in this point I may be mis|taken, there is another in which I think I cannot; and that is, that it is at least a par|donable
<PB N="v" REF="025769_0005_0FCF13116D7CA358">
ambition; in which I shall certain|ly stand acquitted by every one who knows your character, the delicacy of your taste in the choice of your friends, and the real honour it does to those you are pleased to admit into that number.</P>
<P>BUT even this SIR, your penetration will soon discover to proceed from the same vanity I before suspected myself to be guilty of. And the world will judge, that I speak it rather to do <HI>myself</HI> honour than <HI>you.</HI> However, I am beforehand with them in the observation. And that I may not be tempted, in this address, to en|hance your character (according to the usual style of dedications) in order to do honour to my own, and at once oppress your modesty and expose my vanity, I shall put an end to it, without so much as attempting to describe a character, which I shall, however, always aim to imitate.</P>
<P>BUT that you may continue to adorn that publick and useful station you are in, and long live a patron and pattern of solid

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE subject of the ensuing treatise is of great importance; and yet I do not re|member to have seen it cultivated with that precision, perspicuity and force, with which many other moral and theological themes have been man|aged. And indeed it is but rarely that we find it professedly and fully recommended to us in a set and regular discourse, either from the pulpit or the press. This consideration, togeth|er with a full persuasion of its great and exten|sive usefulness, hath excited the present attempt to render it more familiar to the minds of christians.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> indeed, has a treatise upon this sub|ject; entitled, <HI>The mischief of self ignorance, and the benefit of self acquaintance.</HI> And I freely acknowledge some helps I have received from him. But he hath handled it (according to his manner) in so lax and diffuse a way, introducing so many things into it that are foreign from it, omitting others that prop|erly belong to it, and skimming over some with a too superficial notice, that I own I found myself
<PB N="viii" REF="025769_0008_0FCF12EA58BF1540">
much disappointed in what I expected from him. And was convinced that something more correct, nervous, and methodical was wanting on this subject.</P>
<P>I am far from having the vanity to think that this which I now offer to the publick, is entirely free from those faults which I have remarked in that pious and excellent author; and am sensible, that if I do not fall under a much heavier censure my|self, it must be owing to the great candour of my reader, which he will be convinced I have some title to, if he but duly consider the nature and extent of the subject. For it is almost impossible to let the thoughts run freely upon so copious and com|prehensive a theme, in order to do justice to it, without taking too large a scope in some particu|lars that have a close connexion with it; as I fear I have done (Part I. Chap. XIV.) concerning the knowledge, guard and government of the <HI>thoughts.</HI></P>
<P>But there is a great difference between a short occasional and useful <HI>digression,</HI> and a wide <HI>rambling</HI> from the subject, by following the impulse of a lux|uriant fancy. A judicious taste can hardly excuse the latter; though it may be content the author should gather a few flowers out of the common road, provided he soon returns into it again.</P>
<P>This brings to my mind another thing, for which, I am sure, I have great reason to crave the reader's indulgence; and that is, the free use I have made of some of the <HI>ancient heathen writers</HI> in my marginal quotations, which I own looks like an ostentation
<PB N="ix" REF="025769_0009_0FCF13178C064EE0">
of reading, which I always abhorred. But it was conversing with those authors that first turned my thoughts to this subject. And the good sense I met with in most of their aphorisms and sentiments, gave me an esteem for them; and made it difficult for me to resist the temptation of transcribing sev|eral of them, which I thought pertinent to the matter in hand. But after all, I am ashamed to see what an old fashioned figure they make in the margin. How|ever, if the reader thinks they will too much inter|rupt the course of the subject, he may entirely omit them; though by that means he will perhaps lose the benefit of some of the finest sentiments in the book.</P>
<P>I remember a modern writer, I have very lately read, is grievously offended with Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> for so much as mentioning the name of <HI>Plato,</HI> and pre|suming in one of his <HI>Spectators</HI> to deliver his notions of <HI>humour</HI> in a kind of allegory, after the manner of that <HI>Greek</HI> author; which he calls a <HI>formal method of trifling, introduced under a deep oftentation of learning, which deserves the severest rebuke</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See introduction to an essay towards fixing the true standard of wit, &amp;c. page 20, 21.</NOTE>. And perhaps a more severe one was never given upon so small a provocation. From gentlemen of so refined and delicate a taste I can expect no mercy. But the publick is to judge, whether this be not as culpa|ble an affectation as the contrary one, which pre|vailed so much in the last century.</P>
<P>One great view I had in mine eye when I put these thoughts together, was the benefit of youth,
<PB N="x" REF="025769_0010_0FCF12EBD4D9A968">
and especially those of them that are students and candidates for the sacred ministry; for which they will find no science more immediately necessary (next to a good acquaintance with the word of GOD) than that which is recommended to them in the following treatise; to which every branch of human literature is <HI>subordinate,</HI> and ought to be <HI>subservient.</HI> For certain it is, the great end of phi|losophy, both natural and moral, is to <HI>know our|selves,</HI> and to <HI>know GOD. The highest learning is to be wise, and the greatest wisdom is to be good;</HI> as <HI>Marcus Antoninus</HI> somewhere observes.</P>
<P>It has often occured to my mind in digesting my thoughts upon this subject, what a pity it is that this most useful science should be so generally neg|lected in the modern methods of education; and that preceptors and tutors both in publick and pri|vate seminaries of learning, should forget that the <HI>forming</HI> the <HI>manners</HI> is more necessary to a finished education than <HI>furnishing</HI> the <HI>minds</HI> of youth. <HI>So|crates,</HI> who <HI>made all his philosophy subservient to moral|ity</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Totam philosophiam revocavit ad mores. Sen. Epist. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE>, was of this sentiment; and took more pains to rectify the tempers, than replenish the under|standings of his pupils; and looked upon all knowledge as useless speculation, that was not brought to this end, to make us <HI>wiser</HI> and <HI>better</HI> men. And without doubt, if in the academy the youth has once happily learned the great art of managing his temper, governing his passions, and guarding his foibles, he will find a more solid ad|vantage
<PB N="xi" REF="025769_0011_0FCF1318DD684260">
from it in after life, than he could expect from the best acquaintance with all the systems of ancient and modern philosophy.</P>
<P>It was a very just and sensible answer, which <HI>Agesilaus,</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> King, returned to one who asked him <HI>What it was in which youth ought principally to be instructed?</HI> He replied, <HI>that which they have most need to practise when they are men</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See Plutarch's Laconick Apothegms, under the word Ages|ilaus.</NOTE>. Were this single rule but carefully attended to in the method of education, it might probably be conducted in a manner much more to the advantage of our youth than it ordinarily is. For as Dr. <HI>Fuller</HI> observes, <HI>that pains we take in books or arts, which treat of things remote from the use of life, is but a busy idleness</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Rule of life, page 82.</NOTE>. And what is there in life which youth will have more frequent occasion to practise than this? What is there which they afterwards more regret the want of? What is there in which they want more direction and assistance than the right gov|ernment of their passions and prejudices? And what more proper season to receive those assistan|ces, and to lay a foundation for this difficult but very important science, than the early part of youth?</P>
<P>It may be said, "it is properly the office and care of parents to watch over and correct the tempers of their children in the first years of their infancy, when it may easiest be done." But if it be not
<PB N="xii" REF="025769_0012_0FCF12EEC3F94DB0">
done effectually <HI>then</HI> (as it very seldom is) there is the more necessity for it afterwards. But the truth is, it is the proper office and care of all who have the charge of youth, and ought to be looked upon as the most important and necessary part of edu|cation.</P>
<P>It was the observation of a great divine and re|former, that <HI>he who acquires his learning at the expense of his, morals is the worse for his education</HI> <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Qui proficit in literis et deficit in moribus, non proficit sed deficit. Oecolampadius. See Hist. of Pop. Vol. ii. p. 337.</NOTE>. And we may add, that he who does not improve his temper, together with his understanding, is not much the better for it. For he ought to measure his progress in science by the improvement of his morals; and remember that he is no further a learned man than he is a wise and good man; and that he cannot be a finished philosopher till he is a christian <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Te in scienti&acirc; profecisse creda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> quantum in moribus fueria emendatior; eo usque doctum, in quantum bonum: It a philoso|phum, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t christianum. Praes. ad Nem.</NOTE>. But whence is it that <HI>moral</HI> philosophy, which was so carefully cultivated in the ancient academy, should be forced in the modern to give place to <HI>natural,</HI> that was originally designed to be subser|vient to it? Which is to exalt the handmaid into the place of the mistress <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Things were coming to this pass so early as Seneca's time; who laments that plain and open truth was turned into a dark and intricate science. "Philosophy (says he) is turned into phi|lology; and that through the fault of both masters and scholars; the one teach to dispute, not to live; and the other come to them to mend their wits, not their manners. Whereas philosophy is nothing else but a rule of life. Quid autom philosophi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, nisi vitae <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">."</NOTE> This appears not on|ly
<PB N="xiii" REF="025769_0013_0FCF131A51411570">
a preposterous, but a pernicious method of in|stitution. For as the mind takes a turn of thought in future life, suitable to the tincture it hath re|ceived in youth, it will naturally conclude, that there is no necessity to regard, or at least to lay any stress upon what was never inculcated upon it as a matter of importance <HI>then.</HI> And so will grow up in a neglect or disesteem of those things which are more necessary to make a person a wise and truly understanding man, than all those rudi|ments of science he brought with him from the school or college.</P>
<P>It is really a melancholy thing to see a young gentleman of shining parts, and a sweet disposi|tion, who has gone through the common course of academical studies, come out into the world un|der an absolute government of his passions and prejudices: Which have increased with his learn|ing, and which, when he comes to be better ac|quainted with human life and human nature, he is soon sensible and ashamed of; but perhaps is never able to conquer as long as he lives, for what of that assistance which he ought to have received in his education. For a wrong education is one of those <HI>three things</HI> to which it is owing (as an ancient christian and philosopher justly observes) that so few have the right government of their passions <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">&mdash;Bad passions spring up in the mind three ways; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> through a bad education, great ignorance, or a disorder in the animal frame. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> From a bad education. For if we have not been taught from out childhood to govern our passions, with all possible care, they will soon come to have the government of us. Nemes. de Nat. Hom. page 182.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="025769_0014_0FCF12F256031608">I would not be thought to depreciate any part of human literature, but should be glad to see this most useful branch of science, the knowledge of the heart, the detecting and correcting hurtful pre|judices, and the right government of the temper and passions, in more general esteem; as necessa|ry at once to form the gentleman, the scholar and the christian.</P>
<P>And if there be any thing in this short treatise which may be helpful to students, who have a re|gard to the right government of their minds, whilst they are furnishing them with useful knowledge, I would particularly recommend it to <HI>their</HI> pe|rusal.</P>
<P>I have nothing further to add, but to desire the reader's excuse for the freedom with which I have delivered my sentiments in this matter, and for detaining him so long from his subject; which I now leave to his candid and serious thoughts, and the blessing of Almighty GOD to make it useful to him.</P>

<HEAD>A TREATISE OF SELF KNOWLEDGE.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Nature and Importance of the Subject.</HEAD>
<P>A DESIRE of knowledge is natural to the mind of man. And nothing discovers the true quality and disposition of the mind more, than the particular kind of knowledge it is most fond of.</P>
<P>Thus we see that low and little minds are most delighted with the knowledge of <HI>trifles;</HI> as in children. An indolent mind, with that which
<PB N="20" REF="025769_0020_0FCF12F656330778">
serves only for <HI>amusements</HI> or the entertainment of the fancy. A curious mind is best pleased with <HI>facts.</HI> A judicious penetrating mind, with <HI>demonstration</HI> and mathematical science. A worldly mind esteems no knowledge like that of the <HI>world.</HI> But a wise and and pious man before all other kinds of knowl|edge perfers that of GOD and his own <HI>soul.</HI></P>
<P>But some kind of knowledge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> other the mind is continually craving after. And by considering what that is, its prevailing turn and temper may easily be known.</P>
<P>This <HI>desire of knowledge,</HI> like other affections planted in our nature, will be very apt to lead us wrong, if it be not well regulated. When it is directed to improper objects, or pursued in a wrong manner, it degenerates into a vain and criminal <HI>curiosity.</HI> A fatal instance of this in our first par|ents we have upon sacred record; the unhappy effects of which are but too visible in all.</P>
<P><HI>Self knowledge</HI> is the subject of the ensuing treatise. A subject which the more I think of, the more important and extensive it appears. So im|portant that every branch of it seems absolutely necessary to the right government of the life and temper. And so extensive, that the nearer view we take of its several branches, the more are still opening to view, as nearly connected with it as the other. Like what we find in <HI>microscopical observa|tions</HI> on natural objects. The better the glasses, and the nearer the scrutiny, the more wonders we ex|plore; and the more surprising discoveries we make
<PB N="21" REF="025769_0021_0FCF1321BB21AE18">
of certain properties, parts or affections belonging to them, which were never before thought of. For in order to a true <HI>self knowledge,</HI> the human mind, with its various powers and operations, must be narrowly inspected; all its secret bendings and doublings displayed. Otherwise our self acquaint|ance will be but very partial and defective; and the heart after all will deceive us. So that in treat|ing this subject there is no small danger, either of doing injury to it, by slight and superficial inquest <HI>on the one hand,</HI> or of running into a research too minute and philosophical for common use <HI>on the other.</HI> The two extremes I shall keep in my eye, and endeavour to steer a middle course between them.</P>
<P><HI>Know thyself,</HI> is one of the most useful and com|prehensive precepts in the whole moral system. And it is well known in how great a veneration this maxim was held by the ancients; and in how high esteem the duty of <HI>self examination</HI> as necessa|ry to it.</P>
<P><HI>Thales</HI> the Milesian is said to be the first author of it <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">He was the prince of the philosophers, and flourished about <HI>A. M.</HI> 3330, and was cotemporary with Josiah king of Judah.</NOTE>. Who used to say, that <HI>for a man to know him|self is the hardest thing in the world</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Stanley's Life of Thales.</NOTE>. It was after|wards adopted by <HI>Chylon</HI> the <HI>Lacedemonian;</HI> and is one of those three precepts which <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ny</HI> affirms to have been consecrated at <HI>Delphos</HI> in golden letters. It was afterwards greatly admired and frequently

<HEAD>The several Branches of Self Knowledge. We must know what Sort of Creatures we are, and what we shall be.</HEAD>
<P>THAT we may have a more distinct and or|derly view of this subject, I shall here con|sider the several branches of self knowledge; or some of the chief particulars wherein it consists. Whereby perhaps it will appear to be a more co|pious and comprehensive science than we imagine. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. To know ourselves, is <HI>to know and seriously con|sider what sort of creatures we are, and what we shall be.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What we are.</HI></P>
<P>Man is a complex being, <GAP DESC="foreign"> a <HI>tri|partite person;</HI> or a compound creature made up of three distinct parts, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the <HI>body,</HI> which is the earthly or mortal part of him; the <HI>soul,</HI> which is
<PB N="30" REF="025769_0030_0FCF12FF392FF808">
the animal or sensitive part; and the <HI>spirit</HI> or <HI>mind,</HI> which is the rational and immortal part. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This doctrine, I think, is established beyond all dispute, not only by experience, but by authority. It was received by almost all the ancient philosophers. The Pythagoreans; as we learn from <HI>Jamblicus,</HI> vid. Protrept. p. 34, 35. The Platonists; as appears from <HI>Nemesius, Salust, and Laertius,</HI> vid. Di. Laertius, lib. 3. p. 219. The <HI>Stoicks;</HI> as appears from <HI>Antoninus,</HI> who saith expressly, "There are three things which belong to a man; the body, soul, and the mind. And as to the properties of the division, sensation belongs to the body, appetite to the soul, and reason to the mind: <GAP DESC="foreign">" lib. 3. &sect; 16 lib. 2. &sect; 2. lib. 12. &sect; 3.&mdash;Itappears also to have been the opinion of most of the Fathers. vid.

See also <HI>Joseph.</HI> Antiq. lib. 1. cap. 2. p. 5. Constitut. Apostol. lib. 7. cap. 34.&mdash;But above all these, is the authority of scripture, which, speaking of the original formation of man, men|tions the three distinct parts of his nature.

In like manner the Apostle Paul divides the <HI>whole man</HI> into <GAP DESC="foreign"> the <HI>spirit,</HI> the <HI>soul,</HI> and the <HI>body,</HI> 1 Thess. v. 23. and what he calls <GAP DESC="foreign"> here he calls <GAP DESC="foreign"> Rom. vii. 24. the word which <HI>Antoninus</HI> uses to denote the same thing.&mdash;They who would see more of this, may consult Namesiuade Natura Hominis, cap. 1. and Whiston's prim. Christ. vol. 4. pag. 262.</P>
<P>All the observation I shall make hereupon is, that this consider|ation may serve to soften the prejudices of some against the ac|count which scripture gives us of the mysterious manner of the existence of the divine nature: Of which every man (<HI>as created in the images of GOD</HI>) carries about him a kind of emblem, in the threefold distinction of the own; which, if he did not every min|ute find it by experience to be fact, would doubtless appear to him altogether s mysterious and incomprehensible as the <HI>scripture doctrine</HI> of the trinity.</P>
<P>"Homo habet tres partes, spiritum, animam, et corpus; itaque Homo est Imago S. S. Trinitatis." August. Tractat, de Symbolo.</P></NOTE>&mdash;Each of these three parts have their respective offices assigned them. And a man then acts becoming himself, when he keeps them employed in their proper functions, and preserves their natural subordina|tion.&mdash;But it is not enough to know this merely as a point of speculation; we must pursue and re|volve the thought, and urge the consideration to all the purposes of a practical self acquaintance.</P>

<HEAD>The several Relations wherein we stand to GOD, to CHRIST, and our fellow creatures.</HEAD>
<P N="2">II. SELF knowledge <HI>requires us to be well acquaint|ed with the various relations in which we stand to other beings, and the several duties that result from those relations.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Our first and principal concern is to consider the relation wherein we stand to him who gave us being.</HI></P>
<P>We are the creatures of his hand, and the ob|jects of his care. His power upholds the being his goodness gave us. His bounty accommodates us with the blessings of <HI>this</HI> life, and his grace provides for us the happiness of a better.&mdash;Nor are we merely his creatures, but his rational and intelli|gent creatures. It is the dignity of our natur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l, that we are capable of knowing and enjoying him that made us. And as the rational creatures of GOD, there are two relations especially that we bear to him; the frequent consideration of which
<PB N="38" REF="025769_0038_0FCF13054E3B0160">
is absolutely necessary to a right <HI>self knowledge.</HI> For as our Creator, he is our <HI>king</HI> and <HI>father.</HI> And as his creatures we are the <HI>subjects</HI> of his kingdom, and the <HI>children</HI> of his family.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We are the subjects of his kingdom.</HI> And as such we are bound,</P>
<P N="1">1. To yield a faithful <HI>obedience</HI> to the laws of his kingdom.&mdash;And the advantages by which these come recommended to us above all human laws are many.&mdash;They are calculated for the <HI>private</HI> in|terest of every one, as well as that of the publick; and are designed to promote our present, as well as our future happiness.&mdash;They are plainly and explic|itly published; easily understood; and in fair and legible characters writ in every man's heart; and the wisdom, reason, and necessity of them are readi|ly discerned.&mdash;They are urged with the most mighty motives that can possible affect the human heart. And if any of them are difficult, the most effectual grace is freely offered to encourage and assist our obedience: Advantages which no human laws have to enforce the observance of them.&mdash;2. As his <HI>subjects</HI> we must readily pay him the <HI>homage</HI> due to his <HI>sovereignty.</HI> And this is no less than the homage of the heart; humbly acknowledging that we hold every thing of him, and have every thing from him. Earthly princes are forced to be con|tent with verbal acknowledgments, or mere form|al homage. For they can command nothing but what is external. But GOD, who knows and looks
<PB N="39" REF="025769_0039_0FCF1330D723C848">
at the hearts of all his creatures, will accept of nothing but what comes from thence. He demands the adoration of our whole souls, which is most justly due to him who formed them, and gave them the very capacities to know and adore him.&mdash;3. As faithful <HI>subjects,</HI> we must cheerfully pay him the <HI>tribute</HI> he requires of us. This is not like the trib|ute which earthly kings exact; who as much de|pend upon their subjects for the support of their power, as their subjects do upon them for the pro|tection of their property. But the tribute GOD requires of us, is a tribute of praise and honour, which he stands in no need of from us: For his power is independent, and his glory immutable; and he is infinitely able of himself to support the dignity of his universal government. But it is the most <HI>natural</HI> duty we owe to him as creatures. For to praise him, is only to shew forth his praise; to glorify him, to celebrate his glory; and to honour him, is to render him and his ways honourable in the eyes and esteem of others. And as this is the most natural duty that creatures owe to their crea|tor, so it is a tribute he requires of every one of them in proportion to their respective talents and abilities to pay it.&mdash;4. As dutiful <HI>subjects,</HI> we must contentedly and quietly submit to the <HI>methods</HI> and <HI>administrations</HI> of his government, however dark, involved or intricate. All governments have their <HI>arcana imperii,</HI> or <HI>secrets of state;</HI> which common subjects cannot penetrate. And therefore they
<PB N="40" REF="025769_0040_0FCF13085C27A058">
cannot competently judge of the wisdom or recti|tude of certain publick measures; because they are ignorant either of the springs of them, or the ends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them, or the expediency of the means arising from the particular situation of things in the pres|ent juncture. And how much truer is this with relation to GOD's government of the world; whose wisdom is far above our reach, and <HI>whose ways are not as ours.</HI> Whatever then may be the present as|pect and appearance of things, as dutiful <HI>subjects</HI> we are bound to acquiesce; to ascribe wisdom and <HI>righteousness to our maker,</HI> in confidence that the king and <HI>judge of all the earth will do right.</HI>&mdash;Again, 5. As good subjects of GOD's kingdom, we are bound to pay a due regard and reverence to his <HI>ministers;</HI> especially if they discover an uncorrupt|ed fidelity to his cause, and a pure unaffected goal for his honour; if they do not seek their own in|terest more than that of their divine master. The ministers of earthly princes too often do this, and it would be happy if all the ministers and ambassa|dors of the heavenly king were intirely clear of the imputation. It is no uncommon thing for the honour of an earthly monarch to be wounded through the sides of his ministers. The defamation and slander that is directly thrown at <HI>them</HI> is ob|liquely intended against <HI>him;</HI> and as such it is tak|en. So to attempt to make the ministers of the gospel, in general, the objects of derision, as some do, plainly shews a mind very dissolute and dis|affected to GOD and religion itself; and is to act
<PB N="41" REF="025769_0041_0FCF133270918860">
a part very unbecoming the dutiful subjects of his kingdom. Lastly. As good subjects, we are to do all we can to promote the <HI>interest</HI> of his king|dom; by defending the wisdom of his administra|tions, and endeavouring to reconcile others there|unto, under all the darkness and difficulties that may appear therein, in opposition to the profane cen|sures of the prosperous wicked, and the doubts and dismays of the afflicted righteous. This is to act in character as loyal <HI>subjects</HI> of the king of heaven. And whoever forgets this part of his character, or acts contrary to it, shews a great degree of <HI>self ig|norance.</HI></P>
<P>But, 2. As the <HI>creatures</HI> of GOD, we are not only the <HI>subjects of his kingdom,</HI> but the <HI>children of his fami|ly.</HI> And to this relation, and the obligations of it, must we carefully attend, if we would attain the true knowledge of ourselves. We are his children by <HI>creation;</HI> in which respect he is truly our father. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. lxiv. 8.</NOTE> <HI>But now, O LORD, thou art our father, we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thine hands.</HI> And in a more special sense we are his children by <HI>adoption.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cal. iii. 26.</NOTE> <HI>For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</HI> And therefore, 1. We are under the highest obligations to <HI>love</HI> him as our father. The love of children to parents is found|ed on gratitude for benefits received, which can never be requited; and ought in reason to be propor|tioned to those benefits. And what duty more nat|ural than to love our benefactors? What love and
<PB N="42" REF="025769_0042_0FCF130A87C84B58">
gratitude then is due to him, from whom we have received the greatest benefit, even that of our be|ing, and every thing that contributes to the com|fort of it?&mdash;2. As his children we must <HI>honour</HI> him; that is, must speak honourably of him, and for him; and carefully avoid every thing that may tend to dishonour his holy name and ways. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. i. 6.</NOTE> <HI>A son honoureth his father:&mdash;If then I be a father, where is mine honour?</HI>&mdash;3. As our father we are to <HI>apply</HI> to him for what we want. Whether should chil|dren go, but to their father, for protection, help and relief in every danger, difficulty and distress?&mdash;And 4. We must <HI>trust</HI> his power and wisdom, and paternal goodness, to provide for us, take care of us, and do for us, that which is best; and what that is he knows best. To be anxiously fearful what will become of us, and discontented and per|plexed under the apprehensions of future evils, whilst we are in the hands and under the care of our father which is in heaven, is not to act like <HI>children.</HI> Earthly parents cannot avert from their children all the calamities they fear, because their wisdom and power are limited; but our all wise and almighty father in heaven can. They may possibly want love and tenderness, but our heaven|ly father cannot. <HI>Isa.</HI> xlix. 15.&mdash;5. As chil|dren, we must quietly <HI>acquiesce</HI> in his disposals, and not expect to see into the wisdom of all his will. It would be indecent and undutiful in a child to dispute the authority, or question the wisdom, or neglect the orders of his parents every time he
<PB N="43" REF="025769_0043_0FCF1333EC295028">
could not discern the reason and design thereof. Much more unreasonable and unbecoming is such a behaviour towards GOD, <HI>who giveth not account of any of his matters; whose judgments are unsearchable, and whose ways are past finding out.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxxiii. 13. Rom. xi. 33.</NOTE>&mdash;Lastly, As chil|dren, we must patiently <HI>submit</HI> to his <HI>discipline</HI> and <HI>correction.</HI> Earthly parents may sometimes punish their children through passion, or <HI>for their pleasure;</HI> but our heavenly father always corrects <HI>his</HI> for their <HI>profit,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 10.</NOTE> and only if <HI>need</HI> be, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 6.</NOTE> and never so much <HI>as their iniquities deserve.</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ezra ix. 13.</NOTE>&mdash;Under his fatherly rebukes then let us be ever humble and submissive.&mdash;Such now is the true filial disposition. Such a temper, and such a behaviour should we shew towards GOD, if we would act in character as his <HI>children.</HI></P>
<P>These then are the two special relations, which as creatures, we stand in to GOD. And not to act towards him the manner beforementioned, is to shew that we are ignorant of, or have not yet duly considered our obligations to him as his <HI>subjects</HI> and his <HI>children;</HI> or that we are as yet ignorant both of <HI>GOD</HI> and <HI>ourselves.</HI>&mdash;Thus we see how directly the knowledge of ourselves leads us to the knowledge of GOD. So true is the observation of a late pious and very worthy divine, that "He that is a stran|ger to himself, is a stranger to GOD, and to every thing that may denominate him wise and happy <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">See Mr Baxter's dedicatory epistle, prefixed to his treatise on <HI>the benefits of self acqucintance.</HI></NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="025769_0044_0FCF130B4CBB3378">But, 2. In order to <HI>know ourselves</HI> there is ano|ther important relation we should often think of, and that is, <HI>That in which we stand to JESUS CHRIST our Redeemer.</HI></P>
<P>The former was common to us as men; this is peculiar to us as christians, and opens to us a new scene of duties and obligations, which a man can never forget, that does not grossly forget himself. For as christians, we are the disciples, the follow|ers, and the servants of Christ, redeemed by him.</P>
<P>And 1. As the <HI>disciples</HI> of Christ, we are to <HI>learn</HI> of Him. To take our religious sentiments only from his gospel, in opposition to all the authorita|tive dictates of men, who are weak and fallible as ourselves. <HI>Call no man master on earth.</HI> While some affect to distinguish themselves by party names, as the <HI>Corinthians</HI> formerly did, (for which the Apostle blames them) one saying, <HI>I am of Paul;</HI> another, <HI>I am of Apollos;</HI> another, <HI>I am of Cephas,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 12.</NOTE> let us re|member that we are the disciples of Christ; and in this sense <HI>make mention of his name only.</HI> It is re|ally injurious to it, to seek to distinguish ourselves by any other.

the only rule of our faith, the guide of our life, and the foundation of our hope; whatever contempt or abuse we may suffer either from the profane or bigotted part of mankind for so doing.&mdash;2. As christians we are <HI>followers of</HI> CHRIST; and there|fore bound to <HI>imitate</HI> him and copy after that most excellent pattern he hath set us, <HI>who hath left us an example that we should follow his steps.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 21.</NOTE> To see that the <HI>same</HI> holy temper <HI>be in us which was in him;</HI> and to discover it in the same manner that he did, and upon like occasions. To this he calls us, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xi. 29.</NOTE> and no man is any further a christian than as he is a fol|lower of Christ; aiming at a more perfect conform|ity to that most perfect example which he hath set us of universal goodness.&mdash;3. As christians, we are the <HI>servants</HI> of CHRIST; and the various duties which servants owe to their masters in any degree, those we owe to him in the highest degree; who expects we should behave ourselves in his service with that fidelity and zeal, and steady regard to his honour and interest, at all times, which we are bound to by virtue of this relation, and to which his unmerited and unlimited goodness and love lays us under infinite obligations.&mdash;Lastly, We are moreover his <HI>redeemed</HI> servants; and as such are un|der the strongest motives to <HI>love</HI> and <HI>trust</HI> him.</P>
<P>This deserves to be more particularly considered, because it opens to us another view of the human nature, in which we should often survey ourselves, if we desire to know ourselves; and that is, as <HI>de|praved</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="025769_0046_0FCF130CDC794A98">
or <HI>degenerate</HI> beings. The inward contest we so sensibly feel, at some seasons especially, between a good and a bad principle, (called in scripture lan|guage the <HI>flesh</HI> and the <HI>spirit,</HI>) of which some of the wisest heathens seemed not to be ignorant: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><GAP DESC="foreign"> Pythag.

<P>This is a very mortifying thought; but an un|deniable truth, and one of the first principles of that science we are treating of, and very necessary to be attended to, if we would be sensible of the duty and obligations we owe to Christ as the great REDEEM|ER; in which character he appears for the relief and recovery of mankind under this their universal depravity.</P>

myself may I ever think of thee! May the daily consciousness of my weakness and guilt lead my thoughts to thee; and may every thought of thee kindle in my heart the most ardent glow of grati|tude to thee, O thou divine, compassionate friend, lover, and REDEEMER of mankind!"</P>
<P>Whoever then he be that calls himself a christian, that is, who professes to take the gospel of Christ for a divine revelation, and the only rule of his faith and practice; but at the same time, pays a greater regard to the dictates of men, than to the doctrines of CHRIST; who loses sight of that great <HI>example</HI> of Christ, which should animate his chris|tian walk, is unconcerned about his <HI>service, honour,</HI> and <HI>interest,</HI> and excludes the consideration of his <HI>merits</HI> and <HI>atonement,</HI> from his hope of happiness; he forgets that he is a <HI>christian;</HI> he does not consider in what relation he stands to CHRIST, (which is one great part of his character) and consequently discovers a great degree of <HI>self ignorance.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Self knowledge</HI> moreover implies a due atten|tion to the several <HI>relations</HI> in which we stand to our <HI>fellow creatures:</HI> And the obligations that re|sult from thence.</P>
<P>If we know ourselves, we shall remember the condescension, benignity, and love that is due to inferiours: The affability, friendship and kindness we ought to shew to equals: The regard, defer|ence and honour which belong to superiours: And the candour, integrity, and benevolence we owe to all.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="025769_0049_0FCF133AA498E580">The particular duties requisite in these relations are too numerous to be here mentioned. Let it suffice to say, that if a man doth not well consider the several relations of life in which he stands to others, and does not take care to preserve the deco|rum and propriety of those relations, he may justly be charged with <HI>self ignorance.</HI></P>
<P>And this is so evident in itself, and so generally allowed, that nothing is more common than to say, when a person does not behave with due decency towards his superiours, such an one does not <HI>under|stand himself.</HI> But why may not this with equal jus|tice be said of those who act in an ill manner to|wards their inferiours? The expression, I know, is not so often thus applied; but I see no reason why it should not, since one is as common, and as plain an instance of self ignorance as the other. Nay, of the two, perhaps men in general are more apt to be defective in their duty and behaviour towards those beneath them, than they are towards those that are above them. And the reason seems to be, because an apprehension of the displeasure of their superiours, and the detrimental consequences which may ac|crue from thence, may be a check upon them, and engage them to pay the just regards which they ex|pect. But there being no such check to restrain them from violating the duties they owe to inferi|ours, (from whose displeasure they have little to fear) they are more ready under certain temptations to treat them in an unbecoming manner. And as
<PB N="50" REF="025769_0050_0FCF1367C9B970E0">
wisdom and self knowledge will direct a man to be particularly careful, lest he neglect those duties he is most apt to forget; so as to the duties he owes to inferiours, in which he is most in danger of trans|gressing, he ought more strongly to urge upon him|self the indispensable obligations of religion and conscience. And if he does not, but suffers him|self through the violence of ungoverned passion, to be transported into the excesses of rigour, tyranny, and oppression, towards those whom God and na|ture have put into his power, it is certain that he does not <HI>know himself;</HI> is not acquainted with his own particular weakness; is ignorant of the duty of his relation; and whatever he may think of him|self, hath not the true spirit of government; because he wants the art of self government. For he that is unable to govern himself, can never be fit to gov|ern others.</P>
<P>Would we <HI>know ourselves</HI> then, we must consider ourselves as <HI>creatures,</HI> as <HI>christians,</HI> and as <HI>men;</HI> and remember the obligations which, as such, we are under to GOD, to CHRIST, and our <HI>fellow men;</HI> in the several <HI>relations</HI> we bear to them, in order to maintain the propriety, and fulfil the duties of those relations.</P>

<HEAD>We must duly consider the Rank and Station of Life in which Providence has placed us, and what it is that becomes and adorns it.</HEAD>
<P N="3">III. <HI>A MAN that knows himself, will deliberately consider and attend to the particular rank and station in life in which providence hath placed him; and what is the duty and decorum of</HI> that <HI>station; what part is given him to act; what character to maintain; and with what dece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y and propriety he acts</HI> that <HI>part, or maintains</HI> that <HI>character.</HI></P>
<P>For a man to assume a character, or aim at a part that does not belong to him, is affectation. And whence is it that affectation of any kind appears so ridiculous, and exposes men to universal and just contempt, but because it is a certain indication of self ignorance? Whence is it that many seem so willing to be thought <HI>something when they are nothing;</HI> and seek to excel in those things in which they cannot; whilst they neglect those things in which they may excel? Whence is it that they counter|act the intention of nature and providence; that when these intended them one thing, they would fain be another? Whence, I say, but from an ig|norance of themselves, the rank of life they are in, and of the part and character which properly belong to them?</P>

"Drama, and mankind the actors, who have their several parts assigned them by the master of the theatre, who stands behind the scenes, and observes in what manner every one acts. Some have a short part allotted them, and some a long one; some a low and some a high one. It is not he that acts the highest or most shining part on the stage, that comes off with the greatest applause; but he that acts his part best, whatever it be. To take care then to act our respective parts in life well, is ours; but to choose what part in life we shall act, is not ours, but GOD's <NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">Epictet, Enchir. cap. 23.&mdash;Quomodo fabula, sic vita; non qu&agrave;m diu, sed qu&agrave;m bene acta sit, resert.

It is always <HI>self ignorance</HI> that leads a man to act out of character.</P>
<P>Is it a mean and low station of life thou art in? Know then, that providence calls thee to the exer|cise of industry, contentment, submission, patience, hope, and humble dependence on him, and a res|pectful deference to thy superiours. In this way thou mayest shine through shine obscurity; and render thyself amiable in the sight of GOD and man. And not only so, but find more satisfaction; safety and self enjoyment, than they who move in a higher sphere, from whence they are in danger of falling.</P>

<P>And as self acquaintance will teach us what part in life we ought to act, so the knowledge of that will shew us whom we ought to imitate and where|in. We are not to take example of conduct from those who have a very different part assigned them from ours; unless in those things that are univer|sally ornamental and exemplary. If we do, we shall but expose our affectation and weakness, and our|selves to contempt for acting out of character. For what is decent in one may be ridiculous in ano|ther. Nor must we <HI>blindly</HI> follow those who move in the same sphere, and sustain the same character with ourselves; but only in those things that are befitting that character.

But a man may in a good measure correct the fault of his natural tem|per, if he be well acquainted with it, and duly watchful over it.

<HEAD>Concerning the Knowledge of our Constitutional Sins.</HEAD>
<P N="6">VI. SELF acquaintance <HI>shews a man the particu|lar sins he is most exposed and addicted to; and discovers not only what is</HI> ridiculous, <HI>but what is</HI> criminal, <HI>in his conduct and temper.</HI></P>
<P>A man's outward actions are generally the plain|est index of his inward dispositions. And by the allowed sins of his life, you may know the reigning vices of his mind. Is he addicted to luxury or de|bauch? Sensuality then appears to be his prevail|ing taste. Is he given to revenge and cruelty? Choler and malice then reign in his heart. Is he confident, bold and enterprising? Ambition ap|pears to be the secret spring. Is he fly and design|ing, given to intrigue and artifice? You may con|clude, there is a natural subtilty of temper that prompts him to this; and this secret disposition is criminal, in proportion to the degree in which these outward actions, which spring from it, transgress the bounds of reason and virtue.</P>
<P>Every man hath something peculiar in the turn or cast of his mind, which distinguishes him as much as the particular constitution of his body. And both these, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> his particular turn of mind, and constitution of body, not only incline and dispose him to some kind of sins, more than to others, but
<PB N="61" REF="025769_0061_0FCF13439557B6F0">
render the practice of certain virtues much more easy. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Men, with regard to their bodies, and bodily appetites, are pretty much alike; but with regard to their souls, and their men|tal tastes and dispositions, they are often as different as if they were quite of another species; governed by different views, enter|tertained with different pleasures, animated with different hopes, and affected by different motives, and distinguished by as differ|ent tempers and inclinations, as if they were not of the same kind. So that I am very ready to believe, that there is not a greater dif|ference between an angel, and some of the best and wisest of men; or between a devil, and some of the worst and wickedest of men, with regard to their tempers and dispositions, than there is between some sort of men, and some others. And what inclines me to this sentiment is, considering the easy transition which nature always observes in passing from one order or kind of beings to another (which I have before taken notice of) together with the prodigious difference there appears to be between some and others of the hu|man species, almost in every thing belonging to their souls. For some there are "in whom" (as one expresses it) "one would think nature had placed every thing the wrong way;" depraved in their opinions, unintelligible in their reasoning, irregular in their actions, and vicious in every disposition. Whilst in some oth|ers we see almost every thing amiable and excellent that can a|dorn and exalt the human mind, under the disadvantages of mor|tality.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now these sins to which men are commonly most inclined, and the temptations which they have the least power to resist, are, and not improperly, called their <HI>constitutional sins;</HI> their <HI>peculiar</HI> frailties; and, in scripture, their <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Psalm. xviii. 32.</NOTE> <HI>own iniquities,</HI> and the sins which <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 1.</NOTE> <HI>do most easily beset them</HI> <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"><HI>the well circumstanced sin.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

It is in the body of sin, what the heart is in the body of our nature; it begins to live first, and dies last. And whilst it lives, it communicates life and spirit to the whole body of sin; and when it dies, the body of sin expires with it. It is the sin to which our constitution leads, our circumstances betray, and custom inslaves us; the sin to which not our virtues only, but vices too, lower their topsail, and submit; the sin, which when we would impose up|on GOD and our consciences, we excuse and dis|guise with all imaginable artifice and sophistry; but, when we are sincere with both, we oppose first, and conquer last.

<HEAD>The Knowledge of our most dangerous Temptations, necessa|ry to Self Knowledge.</HEAD>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>A MAN that rightly knows himself, is acquaint|ed with his peculiar</HI> temptations; <HI>and knows when, and in what circumstances, he is in the greatest dan|ger of transgressing.</HI></P>
<P>Reader, if ever you would <HI>know yourself,</HI> you must examine this point thoroughly. And if you have never yet done it, make a pause when you have read this chapter, and do it now. Consider in what company you are most apt to lose the possession and government of yourself; on what occasions you are apt to be most vain and unguarded, most warm and precipitant. Flee that company, avoid those occasions, if you would keep your conscience clear. What is it that robs you most of your time and your temper? If you have a due regard to the improvement of the one, and the preservation of the other, you will regret such a loss; and shun the occasions of it, as carefully as you would a road beset with robbers.</P>
<P>But especially must you attend to the occasions which most usually betray you into your favourite vices; and consider the spring from whence they arise, and the circumstances which most favour them. They arise doubtless from your natural temper, which strongly disposes and inclines you to them. <HI>That</HI> temper then, or particular turn of desire, must
<PB N="67" REF="025769_0067_0FCF1349031E5700">
be carefully watched over as a most dangerous quar|ter. And the opportunities and circumstances which favour those inclinations must be resolutely avoided, as the strongest temptations. For the way to subdue a criminal inclination is, first, to avoid the known occasions that excite it; and then to curb the first motions of it <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Principiis obsta: sero medicina paratur, Cum mala per longas invaluere moras. Ovid.</NOTE>. And thus hav|ing no opportunity of being indulged, it will of itself in time lose its force, and fail of its wonted victory.</P>
<P>The surest way to conquer, is sometimes to de|cline a battle; to weary out the enemy, by keep|ing him at bay. <HI>Fabius Maximus</HI> did not use this stratagem more successfully against <HI>Hannibal</HI> than a christian may against his peculiar vice, if he be but watchful of his advantages. It is dangerous to provoke an unequal enemy to the fight, or run into such a situation, where we cannot expect to escape without a disadvantageous encounter.</P>
<P>It is of unspeakable importance, in order to <HI>self knowledge</HI> and <HI>self government,</HI> to be acquainted with all the accesses and avenues to sin, and to observe which way it is that we ourselves too often ap|proach it; and to set reason and conscience to guard those passes, those usual inlets to vice, which if a man once enters, he will find a retreat ex|tremely difficult <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">&mdash;me vestigia terrent Omnia te adversam spectantia, nulla retrorsum.

<P><PB N="68" REF="025769_0068_0FCF137A617C0D50">"Watchfulness, which is always necessary, is chiefly so when the first assaults are made. For then the enemy is most easily repulsed; if we never suffer him to get within us, but upon the very first approach draw up our forces, and fight him without the gate. And this will be more manifest, if we observe by what methods and de|grees temptations grow upon us.&mdash;The first thing that presents itself to the mind is a plain single <HI>thought;</HI> this straight is improved into a strong <HI>imagination;</HI> that again enforced by a sensible <HI>de|light;</HI> then follow evil <HI>motions;</HI> and when these are once stirred there wants nothing but the <HI>assent</HI> of the <HI>will,</HI> and then the work is finished. Now the first steps to this are seldom thought worth our care; sometimes not taken notice of; so that the enemy is frequently got close up to us, and even within our trenches, before we observe him." <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Stanhope's Thomas &agrave; Kempis, page 22.</NOTE></P>
<P>As men have their particular sins, which do <HI>most easily beset them;</HI> so they have their particular temptations, which do most <HI>easily overcome</HI> them. <HI>That</HI> may be a very great temptation to one, which is none at all to another. And if a man does not know what are his greatest temptations, he must have been a great stranger indeed to the business of self employment.</P>
<P>As the subtle enemy of mankind takes care to draw men gradually into sin, so he usually draws

them by degrees into temptation. As he disguises the sin, so he conceals the temptation to it; well knowing, that were they but once sensible of their danger of sin, they would be ready to be on their guard against it. Would we know ourselves tho|roughly then, we must get acquainted not only with our most usual temptations, that we be not unawares drawn into <HI>sin,</HI> but with the previous steps and preparatory circumstances, which make way for those temptations, that we be not drawn unawares into the <HI>occasions</HI> of sin; for those things which lead us into temptations are to be consider|ed as temptations, as well as those which immedi|ately lead us into sin.

Or were they imposed upon us, and dictated to our easy belief, before we were able to judge of them? This is most likely. For the impressions we early receive generally grow up with us, and are those we least care to part with. However, which way soever we came by them, they must be reexamined, and brought to the <HI>touchstone</HI> of sound sense, solid reason, and plain scripture. If they will not bear this after hard rubbing, they must be dismissed, as no genuine principles of truth, but as counterfeits imposed up|on us under the guise and semblance of it.</P>
<P>And as <HI>reason</HI> and <HI>scripture</HI> must discover our prejudices to us, so they only can help us to get rid of them. By these are we to rectify, and to these are we to conform, all our opinions and senti|ments in religion, as our own standard, exclusive of all other rules, light or authority, whatsoever.</P>
<P>And care must further be taken that we do not make scripture and reason bend and buckle to our notions; which will rather confirm our prejudices than cure them. For whatever cannot evidently be proved, without the help of overstrained meta|phors, and the arts of sophistry, is much to be sus|pected;

<P>What is the reason, for instance, that we can|not help having a more hearty affection for some persons than others? Is it from a similarity of taste and temper? Or something in their address, that slatters our vanity? Or something in their humour, that hits our fancy? Or something in their con|versation, that improves our understanding?

<P>And so on the other hand, with regard to our disaffection towards any one, or the disgust we have taken against him; if we would know our|selves, we must examine into the bottom of this; and see not only what is the pretended, but true cause of it: Whether it be justifiable, and our re|sentments

<P>For as to the former, his way of <HI>thinking, talking</HI> and <HI>acting,</HI> may possibly be juster than my own; which the mere force of custom and habit only makes me prefer to his.

<P>But let fancy muster up all the discouraging cir|cumstances, and set them in the most formidable light, to bar your way to a supposed duty; for in|stance, "It is very difficult, I want capacity, at least am so indisposed to it at present, that I shall make nothing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; and then it will be attended with danger to my person, reputation or peace; and the opposition I am like to meet with is great, &amp;c."

<P>Before I dismiss this head, I must observe, that some of our strongest prejudices arise from an ex|cessive <HI>self esteem,</HI> or too great a complacency in our

The fulness of his self sufficiency makes him blind to those im|perfections which every one can see in him but himself.

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Necessity and Means of knowing our Natural Temper.</HEAD>
<P N="9">IX. ANOTHER <HI>very important branch of self knowledge is, the knowledge of those governing passions or dispositions of the mind, which generally form what we call a man's</HI> natural temper.</P>
<P>The difference of natural <HI>tempers</HI> seems to be chief|ly owing to the different degrees of influence, the several passions have upon the mind. <HI>e. g.</HI> If the passions are eager and soon raised, we say the man is of a <HI>warm</HI> temper; if more sluggish and slowly raised, he is of a <HI>cool</HI> temper; according as anger malice or ambition prevail, he is of a <HI>fierce, churlish,</HI> or <HI>haughty</HI> temper; the influence of the softer pas|sions of love, pity and benevolence, forms a <HI>sweet, sympathising</HI> and <HI>courteous</HI> temper; and when all the passions are duly poised, and the milder and pleas|ing ones prevail, they make what is commonly cal|led a quite <HI>good natured</HI> man.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="025769_0084_0FCF138EE83BE570">So that it is the prevalence or predominance of any particular passion which gives the turn or tincture to a man's temper, by which he is distin|guished, and for which he is loved or esteemed, or shunned and despised by others.</P>
<P>Now what this is, those we converse with are soon sensible of. They presently see the fault of our temper, and order their behaviour accordingly. If they are wise and well mannered, they will avoid striking the string which they know will jar and raise a discord within us. If they are our enemies they will do it on purpose to set us on tormenting ourselves. And our friends we must suffer some|times with a gentle hand to touch it, either by way of pleasant raillery or faithful advice.</P>
<P>But a man must be greatly unacquainted with himself, if he is ignorant of his predominant passion, or distinguishing temper, when every one else ob|serves it. And yet how common is this piece of self ignorance? The two apostles, <HI>James</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> discovered it in that very action wherein they meant to express nothing but a hearty zeal for their mas|ter's honour; which made him tell them, <HI>that they knew not what manner of spirit they were of,</HI> Luke ix. 55. <HI>i. e.</HI> that, instead of a principle of love and gen|uine zeal for him, they were at that time governed by a spirit of pride, revenge and cruelty: and yet knew it not. And that the apostle <HI>John</HI> should be liable to this censure, whose temper seemed to be all love and sweetness, is a memorable instance how
<PB N="85" REF="025769_0085_0FCF1359B4E5BB98">
difficult a thing it is for a man at all times to know his own spirit; and that <HI>that</HI> passion, which seems to have the least power over his mind, may on some occasions insensibly gain a criminal ascendant there.</P>
<P>The necessity of a perfect knowledge of our reigning passions appears further from hence; that they not only give a tincture to the temper, but to the understanding also; and throw a strong bias on the judgment. They have much the same effect upon the eye of the mind, as some distempers have upon that of the body. If they do not put it out, they weaken it; or throw false colours before it, and make it form a wrong judgment of things. And, in short, are the source of those foremention|ed prejudices, which so often abuse the human un|derstanding.</P>
<P>Whatever the different passions themselves that reign in the mind may be owing to, whether to the different texture of the bodily organs, or the differ|ent quantity or motion of the animal spirits, or to the native turn and cast of the soul itself; yet cer|tain it is, that men's different ways of thinking are much according to the predominance of their dif|ferent passions; and especially with regard to reli|gion. Thus, <HI>e. g.</HI> we see melancholy people are apt to throw too much gloom upon their religion, and represent it in a very uninviting and unlovely view, as all austerity and mortification; whilst they who are governed by the more gay and cheerful passions, are apt to run into the other extreme, and
<PB N="86" REF="025769_0086_0FCF138AEE174D18">
too much to mingle the pleasures of sense with those of religion; and are as much too lax, as the other are too severe. And thus, by the prejudice or bias of their respective passions, or the force of their natural temper they are led into different mistakes.</P>
<P>"So that would a man know himself, he must study his natural temper; his constitutional incli|nations, and favourite passions; for by these a man's judgment is easily perverted, and a wrong bias hung upon his mind: These are the inlets of pre|judice; the unguarded avenues of the mind, by which a thousand errors and secret faults find admis|sion, without being observed or taken notice of <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Specta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. Vol. vi. No. 899.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>And that we may more easily come at the knowl|edge of our predominant affections, let us consider what outward events do most impress and move us; and in what manner. What is it that usually creates the greatest pain or pleasure in the mind?&mdash;And as for <HI>pain,</HI> a <HI>stoick</HI> indeed may tell us, "that we must keep things at a distance; let nothing that is outward come within us; let externals be exter|nals still." But the human make will scarce bear the rigo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of that philosophy. Outward things, af|ter all, will impress and affect us. And there is no harm in this, provided they do not get the possession of us, overset our reason, or lead us to act unbecom|ing a man or a christian. And one advantage we may reap from hence is, the manner or degree in
<PB N="87" REF="025769_0087_0FCF135AF4FD8188">
which outward things impress us, may lead us into a better acquaintance with <HI>ourselves,</HI> discover to us our weak side, and the passions which most pre|dominate in us.</P>
<P>Our <HI>pleasures</HI> will likewise discover our reigning passions, and the true temper and disposition of the soul. If it be captivated by the pleasures of sin, it is a sign its prevailing taste is very vicious and cor|rupt; if with the pleasures of sense, very low and sordid; if imaginary pleasures, and the painted scenes of fancy and romance do most entertain it, the soul hath then a trifling turn; if the pleasures of science or intellectual improvements are these it is most fond of, it has then a noble and refined taste; but if its chief satisfactions derive from reli|gion and divine contemplation, it has then its true and proper taste; its temper is as it should be, pure, divine, and heavenly; provided these satisfactions spring from a true religious principle, free from that superstition, bigotry and enthusiasm, under which it is often disguised.</P>
<P>And thus, by carefully observing what it is that gives the mind the greatest pain and torment, or the greatest pleasure and entertainment, we come at the knowledge of its reigning passions, and pre|vailing temper and disposition.</P>
<P>"Include thyself then, O my soul, within the compass of thine own heart; if it be not large, it is deep, and thou wilt there find exercise enough. Thou wilt never be able to sound it; it cannot be

<HEAD>Concerning the secret Springs of our Actions.</HEAD>
<P N="10">X. ANOTHER <HI>considerable branch of self acquaint|ance is, to know the true motives and secret springs of our actions.</HI></P>
<P>This will sometimes cost us much pains to acquire. But for want of it, we should be in danger of pass|ing a false judgment upon our actions, and of enter|taining a wrong opinion of our conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="025769_0089_0FCF135C58B6A130">It is not only very possible, but very common, for men to be ignorant of the chief inducements of their behaviour; and to imagine they act from one motive, whilst they are apparently governed by ano|ther. If we examine our views, and look into our hearts narrowly, we shall find that they more frequently deceive us in this respect than we are aware of; by persuading us that we are governed by much better motives than we really are. The honour of GOD, and the interest of religion, may be the open and avowed motives; whilst secular in|terest and secret vanity may be the hidden and true one. While we think we are serving GOD, we may be only sacrificing to <HI>Mammon.</HI> We may like <HI>Jehu,</HI> boast our <HI>real for the Lord,</HI> when we are only animated by the heat of our natural pas|sions <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">2 Kings, x. 16.</NOTE>; may cover a censorious spirit under a cloak of piety; and giving admonition to others, may be only giving vent to our spleen.</P>
<P>Many come to the place of publick worship, out of custom or curiosity, who would be thought to come thither only out of conscience. And whilst their external and professed view is to serve GOD, and gain good to their souls, their secret and inward motive is only to shew themselves to advantage, or to avoid singularity, and prevent others making ob|servations on their absence. Munificence and almsgiving may often proceed from a principle of pride and party spirit, and seeming acts of friend|ship from a mercenary motive.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="025769_0090_0FCF13927118E4B8">By thus disguising our motives we may impose upon men, but at the same time we are imposing upon ourselves; and whilst we are deceiving <HI>oth|ers,</HI> our own hearts deceive <HI>us.</HI> And of all impos|tures <HI>self deception</HI> is the most dangerous, because least suspected.</P>
<P>Now, unless we examine this point narrowly, we shall never come to the bottom of it; and unless we come at the true spring and real motive of our ac|tions, we shall never be able to form a right judg|ment of them; and they may appear very different in our own eye, and in the eye of the world, from what they do in the eye of GOD. <HI>For the Lord seeth not as man seeth: For man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. xvi. 7.</NOTE> And hence it is, that <HI>that which is highly esteemed among men, is</HI> oftentimes <HI>abomination in the sight of GOD.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke xvi. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Every way of man is right in his own eyes; but the LORD pondereth the hearts.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxi. 2.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>Every one that knows himself is in a particular Manner sensible how far he is governed by a Thirst for Applause.</HEAD>
<P N="11">XI. ANOTHER <HI>thing necessary to unfold a man's heart to himself is, to consider what is his</HI> ap|petite for same; <HI>and by what means he seeks to gratify.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="025769_0091_0FCF135DD05843E0">This passion in particular having always so main a stroke, and often times so unsuspected an influence on the most important parts of our conduct, a perfect ac|quaintance with it is a very material branch of <HI>self knowledge,</HI> and therefore requires a distinct con|sideration.</P>
<P><HI>Emulation,</HI> like the other passions of the human mind, shows itself much more plainly, and works much more strongly in some than it does in others. It is in itself innocent; and was planted in our natures for very wise ends, and, if kept under prop|er regulations, is capable of serving very excellent purposes; otherwise it degenerates into a mean and criminal <HI>ambition.</HI></P>
<P>When a man finds something within him that pushes him on to excel in worthy deeds, or in ac|tions truly good and virtuous, and pursues that de|sign with a steady unaffected ardour, without re|serve or falsehood, it is a true sign of a noble spi|rit. For that love of praise can never be criminal that excites and enables a, man to do a great deal more good than he could do without it. And per|haps there never was a fine genius or a noble spi|rit, that rose above the common level, and distin|guished itself by high attainments in what is truly excellent, but was secretly, and perhaps insensibly prompted, by the impulse of this passion.</P>
<P>But, on the contrary, if a man's views centre on|ly in the applause of others, whether it he deserv|ed or not; if he pants after popularity and fame,
<PB N="92" REF="025769_0092_0FCF1393DA778340">
not regarding how he comes by it; if his passion for praise urge him to <HI>stretch himself beyond the line</HI> of his capacity, and to attempt things to which he is unequal; to condescend to mean arts and low dissi|mulation for the sake of a name; and in a sinister, indirect way, sue hard for a little incense, not car|ing from whom he receives it; his ambition then becomes vanity. And if it excite a man to wick|ed attempts, make him willing to sacrifice the es|teem of all wise and good men to the acclamations of a mob; to overleap the bounds of decency and truth, and break through the obligations of honour and virtue, it is then not only vanity, but <HI>vice:</HI> And vice the most destructive to the peace and happiness of human society, and which of all oth|ers hath made the greatest havock and devastation among men.</P>
<P>What an instance have we here of the wide dif|ference between common opinion and truth? That a vice so big with mischief and misery should be mistaken for a virtue! And that they who have been most infamous for it should be crowned with laurels, even by those who have been ruined by it; and have those laurels perpetuated by the common consent of men through after ages! <HI>Seneca's</HI> judg|ment of <HI>Alexander</HI> is certainly more agreeable to truth than the common opinion; who called him "a publick cut throat rather than a hero; and who, in seeking only to be a terrour to mankind, arose to

<P>How different from this is the judgment of <HI>Plutarch</HI> in this mat|ter? who, in his <HI>Oration concerning the fortune and virtue of Alex|ander,</HI> exalts him into a <HI>true berc,</HI> and justifies all the waste he made of mankind under (the same colour with which the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> excused their inhuman barbarities towards the poor <HI>Indians,</HI><ABBR>viz.</ABBR>) a pretence of civilizing them.

<P>Now no man can truly know himself till he be acquainted with this, which is so often the secret and unperceived spring of his actions, and ob|serves how far it governs him in his conversation and conduct; virtue and real excellence will raise to view, though they be not mounted on the wings of ambition, which, by soaring too high, procures but a more fatal fall.</P>

<HEAD>What Kind of Knowledge we are already furnished with, and what Degree of Esteem we set upon it.</HEAD>
<P N="12">XII. A MAN <HI>can never rightly know himself, un|less he examines into his knowledge of other things.</HI></P>
<P>We must consider then the knowledge we have; and whether we do not set too high a price upon it, and too great a value upon ourselves on the ac|count of it; of what real use it is to us, and what effect it has upon us; whether it does not make us too stiff, unsociable, and assuming; testy and supercilious, and ready to despise others for their supposed ignorance. If so, our knowledge, be it what it will, does us more harm than good. We were better without it; ignorance itself would not render us so ridiculous. Such a temper with all our knowledge, shows that we <HI>know not ourselves.</HI></P>
<P>"A man is certainly proud of that knowledge he despises others for the want of."</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="025769_0096_0FCF1396CF3B2F68">How common is it for some men to be fond of appearing to know more than they do, and of seeming to be thought men of knowledge? To which end they exhaust their fund almost in all companies, to outshine the rest. So that in two or three conversations they are drawn dry, and you see to the bottom of them much sooner than you could at first imagine. And even that torrent of learning, which they pour out upon you at first so unmercifully, rather confounds than satisfies you; their visible aim is not to inform <HI>your</HI> judg|ment, but display their <HI>own;</HI> you have many things to query and except against, but their loquacity gives you no room; and their good sense, set off to so much advantage, strikes a modest man dumb: If you insist upon your right to examine, they retreat either in confusion or equivocation; and, like the scuttle fish, throw a large quantity of ink be|hind them, that you may not see where to pursue. Whence this foible flows is obvious enough. <HI>Self knowledge</HI> would soon correct it.</P>
<P>But, as some ignorantly affect to be more knowing, so others vainly affect to be more ignorant than than they are; who, to shew they have greater in|sight and penetration than other men, insist upon the absolute uncertainty of science; will dispute even first principles; grant nothing as certain, and so run into downright <HI>Pyrrhonism;</HI> the too com|mon effect of abstracted debates <HI>excessively</HI> refined. <NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Socrates's</HI> saying, Nihilse scire, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ipsum, savoured of an affected humility.

<P><PB N="97" REF="025769_0097_0FCF13625F2FB038">Every one is apt to set the greatest value upon that kind of knowledge, in which he imagines he himself most excels; and to undervalue all other in comparison of it. There wants some certain rule then, by which some men's knowledge is to be tried, and the value of it estimated. And let it be this.&mdash;"That is the best and most valuable kind of knowledge, that is most subservient to the best ends; <HI>i. e.</HI> which tends to make a man wiser and better, or more agreeable, and useful both to himself and others."&mdash;For knowledge is but a <HI>means</HI> that relates to some <HI>end.</HI> And as all means are to be judged of by the excellency of the end, and their expediency to produce it; so <HI>that</HI> must be the best knowledge that hath the <HI>directest</HI> ten|dency to promote the <HI>best</HI> ends; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> a man's own true happiness, and that of others; in which the glory of GOD, the ultimate end, is ever necessarily comprised.</P>
<P>Now, if we were to judge of the several kinds of science by this rule, we should find, 1. Some of them to be very <HI>hurtful</HI> and <HI>pernicious;</HI> as tend|ing to pervert the true end of knowledge; to ruin a man's own happiness, and make him more inju|rious to society. Such is the knowledge of vice, the various temptations to it, and the secret ways
<PB N="98" REF="025769_0098_0FCF139858E24510">
of practising it; especially the arts of dissimula|tion, fraud, and dishonesty. 2. Others will be found <HI>unprofitable</HI> and <HI>useless.</HI> As those parts of knowledge, which though they may take up much time and pains to acquire, yet answer no valuable purpose; and serve only for amusement, and the entertainment of the imagination. For instance, an acquaintance with plays, novels, games, and modes, in which a man may be very critical and expert, and yet not a wit the wiser or more useful man. 3. Other kinds of knowledge are good only <HI>relative|ly,</HI> or conditionally, and may be more useful to one than to another; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> a skill in a man's particular occupation or calling, on which his credit, liveli|hood, or usefulness in the world depends. And as this kind of knowledge is valuable in proportion to its end, so it ought to be cultivated with a diligence and esteem answerable to that. Lastly, other kinds of knowledge are good <HI>absolutely</HI> and universally; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the knowledge of GOD and our|selves. The nature of our final happiness and the way to it. This is equally necessary to all. And how thankful should we be, that we, who live un|der the light of the gospel, and enjoy that light in its perfection and purity, have so many happy means and opportunities of attaining this most use|ful and necessary kind of knowledge!</P>
<P>A man can never understand himself then, till he makes a right estimate of his knowledge; till he examines what kind of knowledge he values him|self most upon, and most diligently cultivates;
<PB N="99" REF="025769_0099_0FCF1363E0419568">
how high a value he sets upon it; what good it does him; what effect it hath upon him; what he is the better for it; what end it answers now; or what it is like to answer hereafter.</P>
<P>There is nothing in which a man's self ignorance discovers itself more, than in the esteem he hath for his understanding, or for himself on the ac|count of it. It is a trite and true observation, that <HI>empty things make the most sound.</HI> Men of the least knowledge are most apt to make a show of it, and to value themselves upon it; which is very visible in forward confident youth, raw conceited academicks, and those who, uneducated in their childhood, betake themselves in later life to read|ing, without taste or judgment, only as an accom|plishment, and to make a show of scholarship; who have just learning enough to spoil company, and render themselves ridiculous, but not enough to make either themselves or others at all the wiser.</P>
<P>But beside the formentioned kinds of knowledge, there is another which is commonly called <HI>false knowledge;</HI> which, though it often imposes upon men under the show and semblance of true knowl|edge, is really worse than ignorance. Some men have learned a great many things, and have taken a great deal of pains to learn them, and stand very high in their own opinion on account of them, which yet they must unlearn before they are truly wise. They have been at a vast expense of time, and pains, and patience, to heap together, and to confirm themselves in a set of wrong notions, which
<PB N="100" REF="025769_0100_0FCF143326B33DE8">
they lay up in their minds as a fund of valuable knowledge; which if they try by the foremention|ed rules, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> "the tendency they have to <HI>make them wiser and better,</HI> or <HI>more useful and beneficial to others,"</HI> will be found to be worth just nothing at all.</P>
<P>Beware of this false knowledge. For as there is nothing of which men are more obstinately tena|cious, so there is nothing that renders them more vain, or more averse to <HI>self knowledge.</HI> Of all things, men are most fond of their wrong notions.</P>
<P>The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> often speaks of these men, and their self sufficiency, in very poignant terms; who, <HI>though they seem wise, yet</HI> (says he) <HI>must become fools be|fore they are wise.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iii. 18.</NOTE> Though they think they know a great deal, <HI>know nothing yet as they ought to know.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. viii. 2.</NOTE> But <HI>deceive themselves, by thinking themselves something when they are nothing.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. vi. 3.</NOTE> And whilst they <HI>desire to be teachers of others, understand not what they say, nor where of they affirm.</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 7.</NOTE> And <HI>want themselves to be taught what are the first rudiments and principles</HI> of wisdom. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Heb. v. 11.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>Concerning the Knowledge, Guard, and Government of our Thoughts.</HEAD>
<P N="13">XIII. ANOTHER <HI>part of self knowledge consists in a due acquaintance with our own thoughts, and the inward workings of the imagination.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="025769_0101_0FCF13C1948EC970">The right government of the <HI>thoughts</HI> requires no small art, vigilance, and resolution. But it is a matter of such vast importance to the peace and improvement of the mind, that it is worth while to be at some pains about it. A man that hath so numerous and turbulent a family to govern as his own thoughts, which are too apt to be at the com|mand of his <HI>passions</HI> and <HI>appetites,</HI> ought not to be long from home. If he be, they will soon grow mutinous and disorderly under the conduct of those two headstrong guides, and raise great clamours and disturbances, and sometimes on the slightest occasions. And a more dreadful scene of misery can hardly be imagined, than that which is occa|sioned by such a tumult and uproar whithin, when a raging conscience or inflamed passions are let loose without check or control. A city in flames, or the mutiny of a drunken crew <HI>aboard,</HI> who have murdered the <HI>Captain,</HI> and are butchering one an|other, are but faint emblems of it. The torment of the mind, under such an insurrection and rav|age of the passions, is not easy to be conceived. The most revengeful man cannot wish his enemy a greater.</P>
<P>Of what vast importance then is it for a man to watch over his thoughts, in order to a right gov|ernment of them! To consider what kind of thoughts find the easiest admission, in what man|ner they insinuate themselves, and upon what oc|casions!</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="025769_0102_0FCEE9E08063D698">It was an excellent rule which a wise heathen prescribed to himself, in his private meditations; <HI>manage</HI> (saith he) <HI>all your actions and thoughts in such a manner, as if you were just going out of the world.</HI><NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Mare.

<P>"Nothing can be more unhappy than that man who ranges every where, ransacks every thing, digs into the bowels of the earth, dives into other men's bosoms, but does not consider all the while that his own mind will afford him sufficient scope for inqui|ry and entertainment, and that the care and improvement of him|self will give him business enough."

<P>"Your disposition will be suitable to that which you most fre|quently think on; for the soul is, as it were, tinged with the col|our and complexion of its own thoughts." Id. lib. 5. &sect; 16.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>It may be worth our while then to discuss this matter a little more precisely; and consider, 1. <HI>What kind of thoughts are to be excluded or rejected.</HI> And 2. <HI>What ought to be indulged and entertained.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Some thoughts ought to be immediately banished as soon as they have found entrance.</HI>&mdash;And if we are often troubled with them, the safest way will be to keep a good guard on the avenues of the mind by which they enter, and avoid those occasions which commonly excite them.

to no purpose. To harbour these is to do yourself more injury than it is in the power of your greatest enemy to do you. It is equally a christian's inter|est and duty to <HI>learn, in whatever state he is, there with to be content.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. iv. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. Harbour not too <HI>anxious</HI> and <HI>apprehensive</HI> thoughts. By giving way to tormenting fears, suspicions of some approaching danger or troublesome event, we not only anticipate, but double the evil we fear; and undergo much more from the apprehension of it before it comes, than from the whole weight of it when present. This is a great, but common weakness; which a man should endeavour to arm himself against by such kind of reflections as these;&mdash;"Are not all these events under the certain di|rection of a wise providence? If they befal me, they are then that share of suffering which GOD hath appointed me; and which he expects I should bear as a christian. How often hath my timorous heart magnified former trials? which I found to be less in reality than they appeared upon their ap|proach. And perhaps the formidable aspect they put on, is only a stratagem of the great enemy of my best interest, designed on purpose to divert me from some point of duty, or to draw me into some sin to avoid them. However, why should I torment my|self to no purpose? The pain and affliction the dreaded evil will give me when it comes, is of GOD's sending; the pain I feel in the apprehension of it before it comes, is of my own procuring. Whereby I often make my sufferings more than
<PB N="104" REF="025769_0104_0FCEE9E1EA8738E8">
double; for this overplus of them, which I bring up|on myself, is often greater than that measure of them which the hand of providence immediately brings upon me."</P>
<P N="3">3. Dismiss as soon as may be, all <HI>angry</HI> and <HI>wrath|ful</HI> thoughts.

You have too much good nature willing|ly to give others so much torment; and why should you give it yourself?

<P>Drive from the mind all <HI>silly, trifling,</HI> and <HI>unreason|able</HI> thoughts; which sometimes get into it we know not how, and seize and possess it before we are aware; and hold it in empty, idle amusements, that yield neither pleasure nor profit, and turn to no manner of account in the world; only consume time, and prevent a better employment of the mind.

And indeed there is little difference whether we spend the time in sleep, or in these waking dreams. Nay, if the thoughts which thus insensibly steal up|on you be not altogether absurd and whimsical, yet if they be impertinent and unseasonable, they ought to be dismissed, because they keep out better com|pany.</P>
<P N="6">6. Cast out all <HI>wild</HI> and <HI>extravagant</HI> thoughts, all <HI>vain</HI> and <HI>fantastical</HI> imaginations. Suffer not your thoughts to roam upon things that never were, and perhaps never will be; to give you a visionary pleasure in the prospect of what you have not the least reason to hope, or a needless pain in the ap|prehension of what you have not the least reason to fear. The truth is, next to a clear conscience and a sound judgment, there is not a greater bless|ing than a <HI>regular</HI> and <HI>well governed imagination;</HI> to be able to view things as they are, in their true light and proper colours; and to distinguish the false images that are painted on the fancy, from the representations of truth and reason. For how com|mon a thing is it for men, before they are aware, to confound reason and fancy, truth and imagina|tion together? To take the flashes of the animal spirits for the light of evidence? and think they believe things to be true or false, when they only <HI>fancy</HI> them to be so? and fancy them to be so, be|cause they <HI>would have</HI> them so?

<P N="7">7. <HI>Romantick</HI> and <HI>chimerical</HI> thoughts. By which I mean that kind of wildfire, which the briskness of the animal spirits sometimes suddenly flashes on the mind, and excites images that are so <HI>extremely</HI> ridiculous and absurd, that one can scarce forbear wondering how they could get admittance. These random flights of the fancy are soon gone; and herein differ from that castle building of the imagi|nation before mentioned, which is a more settled amusement. But these are too incoherent and senseless to be of long continuance; and are the maddest fallies, and the most ramping reveries of the fancy that can be. I know not whether my reader understands <HI>now</HI> what I mean; but if he at|tentively regards all that passes through his mind, perhaps he may hereafter by experience.</P>
<P N="8">8. Repel all <HI>impure</HI> and <HI>lascivious</HI> thoughts; which taint and pollute the mind; and though hid from men, are known to GOD, in whose eye they are abominable.

<P N="9">9. Take care how you too much indulge <HI>gloomy</HI> and <HI>melancholy</HI> thoughts. Some are disposed to see every thing in the worst light. A black cloud hangs hovering over their minds; which, when it falls in showers through their eyes, is dispersed; and all within is serene again. This is often pure|ly

mechanical; and owing either to some fault in the bodily constitution, or some accidental disor|der in the animal frame. However, one that con|sults the peace of his own mind will be upon his guard against this, which so often robs him of it.</P>
<P N="10">10. On the other hand, let not the imagination be too <HI>sprightly</HI> and <HI>triumphant.</HI> Some are as unreas|onably exalted, as others are depressed; and the same person at different times often runs into both extremes; according to the different temper and flow of the animal spirits. And therefore the thoughts, which so eagerly crowd into the mind at such times, ought to be suspected and well guard|ed; otherwise they will impose upon our judgments and lead us to form such a notion of ourselves and of things, as we shall soon see sit to alter, when the mind is in a more settled and sedate frame.</P>
<P>Before we let our thoughts judge of things, we must set reason to judge our thoughts; for they are not always in a proper condition to execute that office. We do not believe the character which a man gives us of another, unless we have a good opinion of his own; so neither should we believe the verdict which the mind pronounces, till we first examine whether it be impartial and unbiassed; whether it be in a proper temper to judge, and have proper lights to judge by. The want of this pre|vious act of <HI>self judgment,</HI> is the cause of much self deception and false judgment.</P>
<P>Lastly. With abhorrence reject immediately all <HI>profane</HI> and <HI>blasphemous</HI> thoughts; which are some|times

suddenly injected into the mind, we know not <HI>how,</HI> though we may give a pretty good guess <HI>from whence.</HI> And all those thoughts which are appar|ently temptations and inducements to sin, our Lord hath, by his example, taught us to treat in this manner <NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">Matt. iv. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These then are the thoughts we should carefully guard against.&mdash;And as they will (especially some of them) be frequently insinuating themselves into the heart, remember to set reason at the door of it to guard the passage, and bar their entrance, or drive them out forthwith when entered; not only as impertinent, but mischievous intruders.</P>
<P>But, II. There are other kinds of thoughts which we ought to <HI>indulge</HI> and with great care and dili|gence <HI>retain</HI> and <HI>improve.</HI></P>
<P>Whatever thoughts give the mind a rational or religious pleasure, and tend to improve the heart and understanding, are to be favoured, often recall|ed, and carefully cultivated. Nor should we dis|miss them, till they have made some impressions on the mind, which are like to abide there.</P>
<P>And to bring the mind into a habit of recover|ing, retaining, and improving such thoughts, two things are necessary.</P>
<P N="1">1. To habituate ourselves to a <HI>close</HI> and <HI>rational way of thinking.</HI> And 2. To <HI>moral reflections</HI> and <HI>relig|ious contemplations.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. To prepare and dispose the mind for the en|tertainment of good and useful thoughts, we must
<PB N="110" REF="025769_0110_0FCF1399CE13DDD8">
take care to accustom it to a <HI>close</HI> and <HI>rational</HI> way of thinking.</P>
<P>When you have started a good thought, pursue it; do not presently lose sight of it, or suffer any trifling suggestion that may intervene to divert you from it. Dismiss it not till you have sifted and exhausted it; and well considered the several con|sequences and inferences that result from it. How|ever, retain not the subject any longer than you find your thoughts run freely upon it; for to con|fine them to it when it is quite worn out, is to give them an unnatural bent, without sufficient employment; which will make them flag, or be more apt to run off to something else.</P>
<P>And to keep the mind intent on the subject you think of, you must be at some pains to recal and re|fix your desultory and rambling thoughts. Lay open the subject in as many lights and views as it is ca|pable of being represented in. Clothe your best ideas in pertinent and well chosen words, delibe|rately pronounced; or commit them to writing.</P>
<P>Whatever be the subject, admit of no inferences from it, but what you see plain and natural. This is the way to furnish the mind with true and solid knowledge. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, on the contrary, <HI>false</HI> knowl|edge proceeds from not understanding the subject, or drawing inferences from it which are forced and unnatural; and allowing to those precarious infer|ences, or consequences drawn from <HI>them,</HI> the same degree of credibility as to the most rational and <HI>best established</HI> principles.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="025769_0111_0FCF13CC0D1A2810">Beware of a <HI>superficial, flight,</HI> or <HI>confused</HI> view of things. Go to the bottom of them, and examine the foundation; and be satisfied with none but clear and distinct ideas (when they can be had) in every thing you read, hear, or think of. For resting in imperfect and obscure ideas, is the source of much confusion and mistake.</P>
<P>Accustom yourself to <HI>speak</HI> naturally, pertinent|ly, and rationally, on all subjects, and you will soon learn to <HI>think</HI> so on the best; especially if you often converse with those persons that speak, and those authors that write in that manner.</P>
<P>Such a regulation and right management of your thoughts and rational powers, will be of great and general advantage to you, in the pursuit of youth|ful knowledge, and a good guard against the levities and frantick fallies of the imagination. Nor will you be sensible of any disadvantage attending it, ex|cepting one, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> its making you more sensible of the weakness and ignorance of others who are often talking in a random, inconsequential manner; and whom it may oftentimes be more prudent to bear with, than contradict. But the vast benefit this method will be of in tracing out truth, and detect|ing errour, and the satisfaction it will give you in the cool and regular exercises of self employment, and in the retaining, pursuing, and improving good and useful thoughts, will more than compensate that petty disadvantage.</P>
<P N="2">2. If we would have the mind furnished and en|tertained with good thoughts, <HI>we must inure it to re|ligious and moral subjects.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="025769_0112_0FCF139B63642A58">It is certain the mind cannot be more nobly and usefully employed than in such kind of contempla|tions. Because the knowledge it thereby acquires, is of all others the most excellent knowledge; and that both in regard of its <HI>object</HI> and its <HI>end;</HI> the ob|ject of it being <HI>GOD,</HI> and the end of it <HI>eternal hap|piness.</HI></P>
<P>The great end of religion is to <HI>make us like GOD,</HI> and to <HI>conduct us to the enjoyment of him.</HI> And what|ever hath not this plain tendency, and especially of it have the contrary, men may call <HI>religion</HI> (if they please) but they cannot call it more out of its name. And whatever is called religious knowl|edge, if it does not direct us in the way to this end, is not religious knowledge; but something else <HI>falsely so called.</HI> And some are unhappily accustomed to such an abuse of words and understanding, as not only to call, but to <HI>think</HI> those things <HI>religion,</HI> which are quite the reverse of it, and those notions <HI>re|ligious knowledge,</HI> which lead them the farthest from it.</P>
<P>The sincerity of a true religious principle, cannot be better known, than by the readiness with which the thoughts advert to GOD, and the pleasure with which they are employed in devout exercises. And though a person may not always be so well pleased with hearing religious things talked of by others, whose different taste, sentiments, or manner of ex|pression may have something disagreeable; yet if he have no inclination to think of them himself, or to converse with himself about them, he hath great reason to suspect that his <HI>heart is not right with
<PB N="113" REF="025769_0113_0FCF13CD8B1D2B48">
GOD.</HI> But if he frequently and delightfully exer|cise his mind in divine contemplations, it will not only be a good mark of his sincerity, but will habit|ually dispose it for the reception of the best and most useful thoughts, and fit it for the noblest enter|tainments.</P>
<P>Upon the whole then, it is of as great importance for a man to take heed what thoughts he entertains as what company he keeps; for they have the same effect upon the mind. Bad thoughts are as infec|tious as bad company; and good thoughts solace, instruct, and entertain the mind, like good compa|ny. And this is one great advantage of retirement: that a man may choose what company he pleases from within himself.</P>
<P>As in the world we oftener light into bad com|pany than good, so in solitude we are oftener troub|led with impertinent and unprofitable thoughts, than entertained with agreeable and useful ones. And a man that hath so far lost the command of himself, as to lie at the mercy of every foolish or vexing thought, is much in the same situation as a <HI>host,</HI> whose house is open to all <HI>comers;</HI> whom, though ever so noisy, rude and troublesome, he can|not get rid of; but with this difference, that the <HI>latter</HI> hath some recompense for his trouble, the <HI>for|mer</HI> none at all; but is robbed of his peace and quiet for nothing.</P>
<P>Of such vast importance to the peace, as well as the improvement of the mind, is the right regula|tion of the thoughts. Which will be my apology

<HEAD>Concerning the Memory.</HEAD>
<P N="14">XIV. A MAN <HI>that</HI> knows himself <HI>will have a re|gard not only to the management of his</HI> thoughts, <HI>but the improvement of his</HI> memory.</P>
<P>The memory is that faculty of the soul, which was designed for the storehouse or repository of its most useful notions; where they may be laid up in safety, to be produced upon proper occasions.</P>
<P>Now a thorough self acquaintance cannot be had without a proper regard to this in two respects. 1. Its furniture. 2. Its improvement.</P>
<P N="1">1. A man that knows himself will have a regard to the <HI>furniture</HI> of his memory; not to load it with trash and lumber, a set of useless notions or low
<PB N="115" REF="025769_0115_0FCF13D26BED1248">
conceits, which he will be ashamed to produce be|fore persons of taste and judgment.</P>
<P>If the retention be bad, do not crowd it. It is of as ill consequence to overload a weak memory, as a weak stomach. And that it may not be cum|bered with trash, take heed what company you keep, what books you read, and what thoughts you favour; otherwise a great deal of useless rubbish may fix there before you are aware, and take up the room which ought to be possessed by better notions. But let not a valuable thought slip from you, though you pursue it with much time and pains before you overtake it. The regaining and refixing it may be of more avail to you than many hours reading.</P>
<P>What pity it is that men should take such im|mense pains, as some do, to learn those things which, as soon as they become wise, they must take as much pain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to <HI>unlearn!</HI>&mdash;A thought that should make us very curious and cautious about the proper fur|niture of our minds.</P>
<P N="2">2. Self knowledge will acquaint a man with the extent and capacity of his memory, and the right way to <HI>improve</HI> it <NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">Tribus rebus potissimum constat optima memoria, intel|lectu, ordine, cura, siquidem bona memoriae pars est rem penitus <HI>intellexisse;</HI> tum, <HI>ordo</HI> facit, ut qum semel exciderent, quasi postli|minio in animum revocamus; porro <HI>cura</HI> omnibus it rebus, non hic tantum plurimum valet. Erasm. de rat, stud, ad calc. Ringel|bergii, p. 168.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is no small art in improving a weak mem|ory, so as to turn it to as great an advantage as many do theirs which are much stronger. A few short
<PB N="116" REF="025769_0116_0FCF13A1CE82CC48">
rules to this purpose may be no unprofitable di|gression.</P>
<P N="1">1. Beware of every sort of <HI>intemperance</HI> in the indulgence of the appetites and passions. Excesses. of all kinds do a great injury to the memory.</P>
<P N="2">2. If it be weak, do not <HI>overlade</HI> it. Charge it only with the most useful and solid notions. A small vessel should not be stuffed with lumber. But if its freight be precious, and judiciously stowed, it may be more valuable than a ship of twice its burden.</P>
<P N="3">3. Recur to the help of a <HI>common place book,</HI> ac|cording to Mr. <HI>Locke's</HI> method; and review it once a year. But take care that by confiding to your minutes or memorial aids, you do not excuse the labour of the memory; which is one disadvantage attending this method.</P>
<P N="4">4. Take every opportunity of uttering your best thoughts in <HI>conversation,</HI> when the subject will ad|mit it; that will deeply imprint them. Hence the tales which common story tellers relate, they never forget, though ever so silly. <NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot"><P>Quicquid didiceris id coafestim doceas; sic et tua firmare, et prodesse aliis potes.

<P N="5">5. Join to the idea you would remember, some other that is more familiar to you, which bears some <HI>similitude</HI> to it, either in its nature, or in the sound
<PB N="117" REF="025769_0117_0FCF139F1D2935C0">
of the word by which it is expressed; or that hath some relation to it either in time or place. And then by recalling <HI>this,</HI> which is easily remembered, you will, (by that <HI>concatenation</HI> or <HI>connection</HI> of <HI>ideas</HI> which Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> takes notice of) draw in <HI>that</HI> which is thus linked or joined with it; which oth|erwise you might hunt after in vain.&mdash;This rule is of excellent use to help you to remember <HI>names.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. What you are determined to remember, think of before you go to sleep at <HI>night,</HI> and the first thing in the <HI>morning</HI> when the faculties are fresh. And recollect at <HI>evening</HI> every thing worth remembering the <HI>day past.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Think it not enough to furnish this store|house of the mind with good thoughts, but lay them up there in <HI>order,</HI> digested or ranged under proper subjects or classes; that whatever subject you have occasion to think or talk upon, you may have re|course immediately to a good thought which you heretofore laid up there under <HI>that subject.</HI> So that the very mention of the subject may bring the thought to hand; by which means you will carry a regular <HI>common place book</HI> in your memory. And it may not be amiss sometimes to take an <HI>inventory</HI> of this mental furniture, and recollect how many good thoughts you have treasured up under such particular subjects, and whence you had them.</P>
<P>Lastly. Nothing helps the memory more than often <HI>thinking, writing</HI> or <HI>talking</HI> on those subjects you would remember.&mdash;But enough of this.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Concerning the Mental Taste.</HEAD>
<P N="15">XV. A MAN <HI>that</HI> knows himself, is <HI>sensible of, and attentive to the particular</HI> taste of his mind, <HI>especially in matters of religion.</HI></P>
<P>As the late Mr. <HI>Howe</HI> judiciously observes, "there is beside bare understanding and judgment, and diverse from that heavenly gift, which in the scrip|ture is called grace, such a thing as <HI>gust</HI> and <HI>relish</HI> belonging to the mind of man, (and, I doubt not, with all men, if they observe themselves) and which are as unaccountable, and as various as the relishes and disgusts of <HI>sense.</HI> This <HI>they</HI> only wonder at who <HI>understand not themselves,</HI> or will consider nobody but themselves.&mdash;So that it cannot be said univer|sally, that it is a better judgment, or more grace that determines men the one way or the other; but somewhat in the temper of their minds distinct from <HI>both,</HI> which I know not how better to express than by MENTAL TASTE.&mdash;And this hath no more of mystery in it, than that there is such a thing belonging to our natures as complacency and dis|placency in reference to the objects of the mind. And this, in the kind of it, is as common to men as human nature; but as much diversified in individ|uals as men's other inclinations are." <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See his humble request both to conformists and dissente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now this different <HI>taste</HI> in matters relating to re|ligion, (though it may be sometimes natural or what is born with a man, yet) generally arises from the
<PB N="119" REF="025769_0119_0FCF13D42879A9F0">
difference of education and custom. And the true reason why some persons have an inveterate dis|relish to certain circumstantials of religion, though ever so justifiable, and at the same time a fixed esteem for others that are more exceptionable, may be no better than what I have heard some very honestly profess, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that the one they have been used to, and the other not. As a person by long use and habit acquires a greater relish for coarse and unwholesome food than the most delicate diet; so a person long habituated to a set of phrases, no|tions, and modes, may, by degrees, come to have such a veneration and esteem for them as to despise and condemn others which he has not been accus|tomed to, though perhaps more edifying and more agreeable to scripture and reason.</P>
<P>This particular <HI>taste</HI> in matters of religion differs very much (as Mr. <HI>Howe</HI> well observes) both from judgment and grace.</P>
<P>However, it is often mistaken for both: When it is mistaken for the former, it leads to <HI>errour;</HI> when mistaken for the latter, to <HI>censoriousness.</HI></P>
<P>This different taste of mental objects is much the same with that, which, with regard to the objects of sense we call <HI>fancy;</HI> for as one man cannot be said to have a better judgment in food than another, purely because he likes some kind of meats better than he; so neither can he be said to have a better judgment in matters of religion purely because he hath a greater fondness for some particular doc|trines and forms.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="025769_0120_0FCF13A5220B4178">But though this <HI>mental taste</HI> be not the same as the judgment, yet it often draws the judgment to it; and sometimes very much perverts it.</P>
<P>This appears in nothing more evidently than in the judgment people pass upon the sermons they hear. Some are best pleased with those discourses which are <HI>pathetick</HI> and <HI>warming,</HI> others with what is more <HI>solid</HI> and <HI>rational,</HI> and others with the <HI>sublime</HI> and <HI>mystical;</HI> nothing can be too <HI>plain</HI> for the taste of some, or too <HI>refined</HI> for that of others. Some are for having the address only to their reason and understanding, others only to their affections and passions, and others to their experience and consci|ences. And every hearer or reader is apt to judge according to his particular taste, and to esteem him the best preacher or writer who pleases him most; without examining first his own particular taste, by which he judgeth.</P>
<P>It is natural indeed for every one to desire to have his own taste pleased, but it is unreasonable in him to set it up as the best, and make it a test and standard to others. But much more unreason|able to expect that he who speaks in publick should always speak to his <HI>taste;</HI> which might as reason|ably be expected by another of a different one. It is equally impossible that what is delivered to a multitude of hearers should alike suit all their tastes, as that a single dish, though prepared with ever so much art and exactness, should equally please a great variety of appetites; among which there may be some, perhaps, very nice and sickly.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="025769_0121_0FCF13D50F9A85A8">It is the preacher's duty to adapt his subjects to the taste of his hearers, as far as fidelity and con|science will admit; because it is well known from reason and experience, as well as from the advice and practice of the apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Rom. xv. 2. Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification. 1 Cor. ix. 22. To the weak, became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.</NOTE> that this is the best way to promote their edification. But if their taste be totally vitiated, and incline them to take in that which will do them more harm than good, and to relish poison more than food, the most charitable thing the preacher can do in that case is, to endeavour to correct so vicious an appetite, which loathes that which is most wholesome, and craves pernicious food; this, I say, it is his duty to at|tempt in the most gentle and prudent manner he can, though he run the risk of having his judgment or orthodoxy called into question by them, as it very possibly may; for commonly they are the most arbitrary and unmerciful judges in this case, who are least of all qualified for that office.</P>
<P>There is not perhaps a more unaccountable weakness in human nature than this, that with re|gard to religious matters our animosities are gene|rally greatest where our differences are least; they who come pretty near to our standard, but stop short there, are more the objects of our disgust and censure, than they who continue at the greatest distance from it. And in some cases it requires
<PB N="122" REF="025769_0122_0FCF13A68DF68A08">
much candour and self command to get over this weakness. To whatever secret spring in the hu|man mind it may be owing, I shall not stay to in|quire; but the thing itself is too obvious not to be taken notice of.</P>
<P>Now we should all of us be careful to find out and examine our proper <HI>taste</HI> of religious things; that if it be a false one, we may rectify it; if a bad one, mend it; if a right and good one, strengthen and improve it. For the mind is capable of a false gust, as well as the palate; and comes by it the same way; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> by being long used to unnatural rel|ishes, which by custom become grateful. And having found out what it is, and examined it by the test of scripture, reason and conscience, if it be not very wrong, let us indulge it, and read those books that are most suited to it, which for that reason will be most edifying. But at the same time let us take care of two things, 1. That it do not bias our judgment, and draw us into <HI>errour,</HI> 2. That it do not cramp our charity, and lead us to <HI>censoriousness.</HI></P>

This is the most effectual way that I know of to secure to one's self the character of a wise man here, and the reward of one hereaf|ter. And between these two there is such a close connexion, that he who does not do the <HI>latter,</HI> can|not be supposed to intend the <HI>former.</HI> He that is not careful of his actions shall never persuade me that he seriously proposes to himself his best inter|est, as his <HI>end;</HI> for if he did, he would as serious|ly apply himself to the other, as the <HI>means.</HI>" <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Nortis's Misc. p. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>There are few that live so much at random as not to have some main end in eye; something that influences their conduct, and is the great object of their pursuit and hope. A man cannot live with|out some <HI>leading</HI> views; a wise man will always know what they are, whether it is fit he should be led by them or no; whether they be such as his understanding and reason approve, or only such as fancy and inclination suggest. He will be as much concerned to <HI>act</HI> with reason, as to <HI>talk</HI> with reason; as much ashamed of a solecism and con|tradiction in his character, as in his conversation.</P>
<P>Where do our views centre? In this world we are in; or that we are going to? If our hopes
<PB N="124" REF="025769_0124_0FCF13A86E7F4260">
and joys centre here, it is a mortifying thought, that we are every day <HI>departing from our happiness;</HI> but if they are fixed above, it is a joy to think that we are every day <HI>drawing nearer</HI> to the object of our highest wishes.</P>
<P>Is our main care to appear great in the eye of man; or good in the eye of GOD? If the former, we expose ourselves to the pain of a perpetual dis|appointment. For it is much if the envy of men do not rob us of a good deal of our just praise, or if our vanity will be content with that portion of it they allow us. But if the latter be our main care, if our chief view is to be approved of GOD, we are laying up a fund of the most lasting and solid satisfactions. Not to say that this is the truest way to appear great in the eye of men; and to concili|ate the esteem of all those whose praise is worth our wish.</P>
<P>"Be this then, O my soul, thy wise and steady pursuit; let this circumscribe and direct thy views; be this a law to thee, from which account it a sin to depart, whatever disrespect or contempt it may expose thee to from others <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"> Epict.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>How to know the true State of our Souls; and whether we are fit to die.</HEAD>
<P>LASTLY, <HI>The most important point of</HI> self knowl|edge, <HI>after all, is to know the true state of our souls towards GOD; and in what condition we are to die.</HI></P>
<P>These two things are inseparably connected in their nature, and therefore I put them together. The knowledge of the former will determine the latter, and is the only thing that can determine it; for no man can tell whether he is fit for death, till he is acquainted with the true state of his own soul.</P>
<P>This now is a matter of such vast moment, that it is amazing any considerate man, or any one who thinks what it is to die, can be satisfied, so long as it remains an uncertainty.&mdash;Let us trace out this important point then with all possible plain|ness; and see if we cannot come to some satisfac|tion in it upon the most solid principles.</P>
<P>In order to know then whether we are fit to die, we must first know <HI>what it is that fits us for death.</HI>&mdash;And the answer to this is very natural and
<PB N="126" REF="025769_0126_0FCF13AB4BC4E8B0">
easy; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that only fits us for death, <HI>that fits us for happiness after death.</HI></P>
<P>This is certain.&mdash;But the question returns. <HI>What is it that fits us for happiness after death?</HI></P>
<P>Now in answer to this, there is a previous ques|tion necessary to be determined; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>What that happiness is?</HI></P>
<P>It is not a fool's paradise, or a Turkish dream of sensitive gratifications. It must be a happiness suit|ed to the nature of the soul, and what it is capable of enjoying in a state of separation from the body. And what can that be, but the <HI>enjoyment of GOD,</HI> the best of beings and the author of ours?</P>
<P>The question then comes to this; <HI>What is that which fits us for the</HI> enjoyment of GOD, in the fu|ture state of separate spirits?</P>
<P>And methinks we may bring this matter to a very sure and short issue; by saying it is <HI>that which makes us like to him now.</HI>&mdash;This only is our proper qualification for the enjoyment of him after death, and therefore our only proper preparation for death. For how can they, who are unlike to GOD here, expect to enjoy him hereafter? And if they have not just ground to hope that they shall enjoy GOD in the other world, how are they fit to die?</P>
<P>So that the great question, <HI>Am I fit to die?</HI> Re|solves itself into this, <HI>Am I like to GOD?</HI> For it is this only that fits me for heaven, and that which fits me for heaven, is the only thing that fits me for death.</P>
<P>Let this point then be well searched into, and examined very deliberately and impartially.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="025769_0127_0FCF13D98AF6FDD8">Most certain it is, that GOD can take no real complacency in any but those that are like him; and it is as certain, that none but those that are like him can take pleasure in <HI>him.</HI>&mdash;But GOD is a most pure and holy being; a being of infinite love, mercy and patience; whose righteousness is invariable, whose veracity inviolable, and whose wisdom unerring. These are the moral attributes of the divine being, in which he requires us to imitate him; the express lineaments of the divine nature, in which all good men bear a resem|blance to him; and for the sake of which only they are the objects of his delight: For GOD can love none but those that bear this im|press of his own image on their souls.&mdash;Do we find then these visible traces of the divine image there? Can we make out our likeness to him in his holiness, goodness, mercy, righteousness, truth and wisdom? If so, it is certain, we are ca|pable of enjoying Him, and are the proper objects of his love.&mdash;By this we know we are fit to die; because by this we know we are fit for happiness af|ter death.</P>
<P>Thus then, if we are faithful to our consciences, and impartial in the examination of our lives and tempers, we may soon come to a right determina|tion of this important question, <HI>What is the true state of our souls towards GOD? and in what condition we are to die?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Nor do I apprehend the knowledge of our state (call it as|surance if you please) so uncommon and extraordinary a thing as some are apt to imagine. Understand by assurance and satisfactory evidence of the thing, such as excludes all reasonable doubts and dis|quieing fears of the contrary, though, it may be, not all transient sus|picions and jealousies. And such an assurance and certainty multi|tudes have attained, and enjoy the comfort of; and indeed it is of so high importance, that it is a wonder any thoughtful christian that believes in eternity can be easy one week or day without it.

<HEAD>Self Knowledge the Spring of Self Possession.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ONE <HI>great advantage of self knowledge is, that it gives a man the truest and most constant</HI> self pos|session.</P>
<P>A man that is endowed with this excellent knowl|edge is calm and easy.</P>
<P N="1">1. Under <HI>affronts</HI> and <HI>defamation.</HI> For he thinks thus: "I am sure I know myself better than any man can pretend to know me. This calumniator hath, indeed, at this time missed his mark and shot his arrows at random; and it is my comfort, that my conscience acquits me of his angry imputation. However, there are worse crimes which he might more justly accuse me of; which, though hid from him, are known to myself. Let me set about reform|ing them; lest, if they come to his notice, he should attack me in a more defenceless part, find some|thing to fasten his obloquy, and fix a lasting re|proach upon my character <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"> Epict. Ench. cap. 48.&mdash;<HI>If you are told that another reviles you, do not go about to vindicate yourself, but reply thus: My other faults I find are hid from him, else I should have beard of them too.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is a great deal of truth and good sense in that common saying and doctrine of the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> though they might carry it too far, that <HI>it is not
<PB N="131" REF="025769_0131_0FCF13DEE0B2AE88">
things but thoughts that disturb and hurt us</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><P><GAP DESC="foreign">Id. cap. 10. <HI>It is not things, but mens opinions of things that disturb them.</HI></P>

It is the mind alone that turns and moves itself.</HI></P></NOTE>. Now as self acquaintance teaches a man the right govern|ment of the thoughts (as is shewn above, Part I. Chap. XIV.) it will help him to expel all anxious, tormenting and fruitless thoughts, and retain the most quieting and useful ones; and so keep all easy within. Let a man but try the experiment, and he will find, that a little resolution will make the greatest part of the difficulty vanish.</P>
<P N="2">2. Self knowledge will be a good ballast to the mind under any accidental <HI>hurry</HI> or <HI>disorder</HI> of the <HI>passions.</HI> It curbs their impetuosity; puts the reins into the hands of reason, quells the rising storm, ere it makes shipwreck of the conscience; and teaches a

And thus will a wise man, for his own peace, deal with the passions of others, as well as his own.</P>
<P><HI>Self knowledge,</HI> as it acquaints a man with his weak|nesses and worst qualities, will be his guard against them; and a happy counterballance to the faules and excesses of his natural temper.</P>
<P N="3">3. It will keep the mind sedate and calm under the surprise of <HI>bad news.</HI> or afflicting <HI>providences.</HI></P>
<P>"For am I not a creature of GOD? And my life and comforts, are they not wholly at his disposal, from whom I have received them; and by whose favour I have so long enjoyed them; and by whose mercy and goodness I have still so many left?"</P>
<P>A heathen can teach me, under such losses of friends, or estate, or any comfort, to direct my eyes to the hand of GOD, by whom it was lent me, and is now recalled; that I ought not to say, <HI>it is lost</HI> but <HI>restored.</HI> And though I be injuriously deprived of it, still the hand of GOD is to be acknowledged; for what is it to me, by what means, he that gave me that blessing, takes it from me again <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Epictst. Enchirid. cap. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He that rightly <HI>knows himself</HI> will live every day dependent on the divine author of his mercies, for the continuance and enjoyment of them. And will learn from a higher authority than that of a heath|en moralist, that he hath nothing he can properly call <HI>his own,</HI> or ought to depend upon as such. That
<PB N="133" REF="025769_0133_0FCF13E0D9BDDBE8">
he is but a <HI>steward</HI> employed to dispense the good things he possesses, according to the direction of his Lord, at whose pleasure he holds them; and to whom he should be ready at any time cheerfully to resign them, <HI>Luke</HI> xvi. 1.</P>
<P N="4">4. Self knowledge will help a man to preserve an equanimity and self possession under all the va|rious scenes of <HI>adversity</HI> and <HI>prosperity.</HI></P>
<P>Both have their temptations: To some the temp|tations of prosperity are the greatest; to others, those of adversity. <HI>Self knowledge</HI> shews a man which of these are the greatest to <HI>him:</HI> And, at the ap|prehension of them, teaches him to arm himself ac|cordingly that nothing may deprive him of his con|stancy and self possession, or lead him to act unbe|coming the man, or the christian.</P>
<P>We commonly say, <HI>no one knows what he can hear till he is tried.</HI> And many persons verify the obser|vation, by bearing evils much better than they fear|ed. Nay, the apprehension of an approaching evil often gives a man a greater pain than the evil itself. This is owing to inexperience and self ignorance.</P>
<P>A man that knows himself, his own strength and weakness, is not so subject as others, to the melan|choly presages of the imagination; and whenever they intrude, he makes no other use of them than to take the warning, collect himself, and prepare for the coming evil; leaving the degree, duration, and the issue of it with him, who is the sovereign disposer of all events, in a quiet dependence on his power, wisdom and goodness.</P>
<P>Such self possession is one great effect and advan|tage of <HI>self knowledge.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Self Knowledge leads to a wise and steady Conduct.</HEAD>
<P N="2">II. AS <HI>self knowledge will keep a man calm and equal in his</HI> temper, <HI>so it will make him wise and cau|tious in his</HI> conduct.</P>
<P>A precipitant and rash conduct is ever the effect of a confused and irregular hurry of thought. So that when by the influence of self knowledge, the thoughts become cool, sedate and rational, the con|duct will be so too. It will give a man that even, steady and uniform behaviour in the management of his affairs, that is so necessary for the dispatch of business; and prevent many disappointments and troubles which arise from the unsuccessful execu|tion of immature or ill judged projects.</P>
<P>In short, most of the troubles which men meet with in the world may be traced up to this source, and resolved into <HI>self ignorance.</HI> We may complain of providence, and complain of men; but the fault, if we examine it, will commonly be found to be our own. Our imprudence, which arises from self igno|rance, either brings our troubles upon us, or increases them. Want of temper and conduct will make any affliction double.</P>
<P>What a long train of difficulties do sometimes proceed from <HI>one</HI> wrong step in our conduct, into which self ignorance or inconsideration betrayed us? And every evil that befals us in consequence of <HI>that,</HI> we are to charge upon ourselves.</P>

<HEAD>Humility the Effect of Self Knowledge.</HEAD>
<P N="3">III. TRUE <HI>self knowledge always produces</HI> hu|mility.</P>
<P>Pride is ever the off spring of self ignorance. The reason men are vain and self sufficient is, because they do not know their own failings; and the rea|son they are not better acquainted with them is, be|cause they hate self inspection. Let a man but turn his eyes within, scrutinize himself, and study his own heart, and he will soon see enough to make him humble. <HI>Behold I am vile,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xi. 4.</NOTE> is the language only of self knowledge <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Qui bene seipsum cognoscit sibi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ipsi vilescit, nec laudibus disectatur humanis. Tho. &agrave; Kemp. de Imit. Chr. lib. 1. cap. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whence is it that young people are generally so vain, self sufficient and assured, but because they have taken no time or pains to cultivate a self ac|quaintance? And why does pride and stiffness ap|pear so often in advanced age, but because men grow old in self ignorance? A moderate degree of self knowledge would cure an inordinate degree of self complacency <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Quanto quis minus se videt, tanto minus sibi displicet. Greg.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Humility is not more necessary to salvation, than self knowledge is to humility <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Scio neminem absque sui cognitione salvari, de qu&acirc; nimirum mater salutis, humilitas oritar, et timor domini.

<P>[CHRIST.] "My son, when thou feelest thy soul warmed with devotion and holy zeal for my service, it will be advisable to decline all those methods of publishing it to the world, which vain men are so industrious to take, and content thyself with its being known to GOD and thine own conscience. Rather endeavour to mo|derate and suppress those pompous expressions of it, in which some place the very perfection of zeal. Think meanly of thy own vir|tues.&mdash;Some men, of a bold, ungoverned zeal, aspire at things beyond their strength, and express more vehemence than conduct in their actions. They are perfectly carried out of themselves with eagerness; forget that they are still poor insects upon earth, and think of nothing less than building their nest in heaven. Now these are often left to themselves, and taught by sad experience, that the saint flutterings of men are weak and ineffectual; and that none soars to heaven except I assist his flight, and mount him on my own wings.&mdash;Virtue does not consist in abundance of il|lumination and knowledge; but in lowliness of mind, in meekness and charity; in a mind intirely resigned to GOD, and sincerely disposed to serve and please him; in a just sense of every mans vileness; and not only thinking very meanly of one's self, but be|ing well content to be so thought of by others. Id. book. 3. chap. 8."</P>
<P>"It is a dangerous drunkenness, I confess, that of wine; but there is another more dangerous. How many souls do I see in the world drunk with vanity, and a high opinion of themselves? This drunk|enness causes them to make a thousand false steps, and a thousand stumbles. Their ways are all oblique and crooked. Like men in drink, they have always a great opinion of their own wisdom, their power, and their prudence; all which often fail them.&mdash;Examine well thyself, my soul; see if thou art not tainted with this evil. Alas! if thou deniest it, thou provest it. It is great pride to think one has no pride; for it is so think you are as good i deed. as you esteem yourself. But there is no man in the world but es|teems himself better than he truly is."</P>
<P>"Thou wilt say, it may be, thou hast a very ill opinion of thyself. But be assured, my soul, thou dost not despise thyself so much as thou art truly despicable.

<P>This indeed can hardly be conceived to be se|parate from that of meekness and charity be|forementioned; but I choose to give it a distinct mention, because I consider it under a different view and operation, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> as that which guards and influences our spirits in all matters of <HI>debate</HI> and <HI>controversy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="025769_0141_0FCF13E6CA78FFF0"><HI>Moderation</HI> is a great and important christian virtue, very different from that bad quality of the mind under which it is often misrepresented and disguised, <HI><ABBR>viz.</ABBR> lukewarmness</HI> and <HI>indifference</HI> about the truth. The former is very consistent with a regu|lar and well corrected zeal, the latter consists in the <HI>total want</HI> of it; the former is sensible of, and in|deavours with peace and prudence to maintain the dignity and importance of divine doctrines, the latter hath no manner of concern about them; the one feels the secret influences of them, the other is quite a stranger to their power and efficacy; the one laments in secret the sad decay of vital religion the other is an instance of it. In short, the one proceeds from true knowledge, the other from great ignorance; the one is a good mark of sinceri|ty, and the other a certain sign of hypocrisy. And to confound two things together, which are so es|sentially different, can be the effect of nothing but great ignorance, inconsideration, or an overheated, injudicious zeal.</P>
<P>A self knowing man can easily distinguish be|tween these two. And the knowledge which he has of human nature in general, from a thorough contemplation of his own in particular, shews him the necessity of preserving a medium (as in every thing else, so especially) between the two extremes of a <HI>bigotted zeal</HI> on the one hand, and <HI>indolent luke|warmness</HI> on the other. As he will not look upon e|very thing to be worth contending for, so he will look upon nothing worth losing his temper for in the
<PB N="142" REF="025769_0142_0FCF13BA0D5A03B8">
contention; because, though the truth be of ever so great importance, nothing can do a greater dis|service to it, or make a man more incapable of de|fending it, than intemperate heat and passion; whereby he injures and betrays the cause he is over anxious to maintain. <HI>The wrath of man work|eth not the righteousness of GOD.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James i. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>Self knowledge heals our animosities, and great|ly cools our debates about matters of dark and doubtful speculation. One who knows himself sets too great a value upon his time and temper, to plunge rashly into those vain and fruitless contro|versies, in which one of them is sure to be lost, and the other in great danger of being so; especi|ally when a man of bad temper and bad principles is the opponent; who aims rather to <HI>silence</HI> his adversary with over bearing confidence, dark un|meaning language, authoritative airs, and hard words, than <HI>convince</HI> him with solid argument; and who plainly contends not for truth but victory. Little good can be done to the best cause in such a cir|cumstance. And a wise and moderate man who knows human nature, and knows himself, will rather give his antagonist the pleasure of an imagi|nary triumph, than engage in so unequal a combat.</P>
<P>An eagerness and zeal for dispute, on every sub|ject, and with every one, shews great self sufficien|cy; that never failing sign of great self ignorance. And true moderation, which creates an indiffer|ence to little things, and a wise and well propor|tioned zeal for things of importance, can proceed
<PB N="143" REF="025769_0143_0FCF13E7D3413300">
from nothing but true knowledge, which has its foundation in self acquaintance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Self Knowledge improves the Judgment.</HEAD>
<P N="6">VI. ANOTHER <HI>great advantage of being well ac|quainted with ourselves is, that it helps us to form a better judgment of other things.</HI></P>
<P>Self knowledge indeed does not inlarge or in|crease our natural capacities, but it guides and re|gulates them; leads us to the right use and appli|cation of them; and removes a great many things which obstruct their due exercise, as pride, preju|dice, and passion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which oftentimes miserably pervert the rational powers.</P>
<P>He that hath taken a just measure of himself, is thereby better able to judge of other things.</P>
<P N="1">1. He knows how to judge of <HI>men</HI> and <HI>human na|ture</HI> better.&mdash;&mdash;For human nature, setting aside the difference of natural genius, and the improvements of education and religion, is pretty much the same in all. There are the same passions and appetites, the same natural infirmities and inclinations in all mankind; though some are more predominant and distinguishable in some, than they are in others. So that if a man be but well acquainted with his own, <HI>this,</HI> together with a very little observation on human life, will soon discover to him those of other men; and shew him very impartially their
<PB N="144" REF="025769_0144_0FCF13BD2A464BD0">
particular failings and excellencies, and help him to form a much truer sentiment of them, than if he were to judge only by their <HI>exterior,</HI> the appear|ance they make in the eye of the world, or the character given of them by others; both which are often very fallacious.</P>
<P N="2">2. Self knowledge will teach us to judge rightly of <HI>facts</HI> as well as men. It will exhibit things to the mind in a proper light, and true colours, with|out those false glosses and appearances which fan|cy throws upon them, or in which the imagination often paints them. It will teach us to judge not with the imagination, but with the understanding; and will set a guard upon the former, which so of|ten represents things in wrong views, and gives the mind false impressions. See <HI>Part</HI> I. <HI>Chap.</HI> IV.</P>
<P N="3">3. It helps us to estimate the true value of all <HI>worldly good things.</HI> It rectifies our notions of them, and lessens that enormous esteem we are apt to have for them. For when a man knows himself, and his true interest, he will see how far, and in what degree, these things are suitable to him, and subservient to his good; and how far they are un|suitable, insnaring, and pernicious. <HI>This,</HI> and not the common opinion of the world, will be his rule of judgment concerning them. By this he will see quite through them; see what they really are at bottom: and how far a wise man ought to desire them. The reason why men value them so extrav|agantly is, because they take but a superficial view of them, and only look upon their outside, where
<PB N="145" REF="025769_0145_0FCF13EA4824E278">
they are most showy and inviting. Were they to look within them, consider their intrinsick worth, their ordinary effects, their tendency and their end, they would not be so apt to over value them. And a man that has learned to see through himself can easily see through these. <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Abstrahunt a recto divitiae, honores, potentia, et caetera quae opinione nostr&acirc; chara sunt, precio suo vilia.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Self Knowledge directs to the proper Exercise of Self Denial.</HEAD>
<P N="7">VII. A MAN <HI>that knows himself best, knows how, and wherein, he ought to deny himself.</HI></P>
<P>The great duty of <HI>self denial,</HI> which our Saviour so expressly requires of all his followers, plain and necessary as it is, has been much mistaken and abused; and that not only by the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> in their doctrines of penance, fasts and pilgrimages,
<PB N="146" REF="025769_0146_0FCF13BF0EF2FEF0">
but by some protestant christians in the instances of voluntary abstinence and unnecessary austerities. Whence they are sometimes apt to be too censori|ous against those who indulge themselves in the use of those indifferent things, which they make it a point of conscience to abstain from. Whereas, would they confine their exercise of self denial to the plain and important points of christian prac|tice, devoutly performing the necessary duties they are most averse to, and resolutely avoiding the known sins they are most inclined to, under the direction of scripture, they would soon become more solid, judicious, and exemplary christians; and did they know themselves, they would easily see that herein there is occasion and scope enough for self denial; and that to a degree of greater se|verity and difficulty than there is in those little corporal abstinences and mortifications they enjoin themselves.</P>
<P N="1">1. Self knowledge will direct us to the necessary exercises of self denial, with regard to the <HI>duties</HI> our tempers are most averse to.</P>
<P>There is no one, but, at some times, find a great backwardness and indisposition to some duties which he knows to be seasonable and necessary. This then is a proper occasion for self discipline. For to indulge this indisposition is very dangerous, and leads to an habitual neglect of known duty; and to resist and oppose it, and to prepare for a diligent and faithful discharge of the duty, not|withstanding the many pleas and excuses that car|nal
<PB N="147" REF="025769_0147_0FCF13EC7AC74590">
disposition may urge for the neglect of it, this requires no small pains and self denial; and yet it is very necessary to the peace of conscience.</P>
<P>As for our encouragement to this piece of self denial, we need only remember that the difficulty of the duty, and our unfitness for it, will, upon the trial, be found to be much less than we apprehend|ed. And the pleasure of reflecting, that we have discharged our consciences, and given a fresh tes|timony of our uprightness, will more than compen|sate the pains and difficulty we found therein. And the oftener the criminal propensions to the wilful neglect of duty are opposed and conquered, the seldomer will they return, or the weaker will they grow. Till at last, by divine grace, they will be wholly overcome; and in the room of them will succeed an habitual <HI>readiness to every good work,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. iii. 1.</NOTE> and a very sensible delight therein: A much hap|pier effect than can be expected from the severest exercises of self denial, in the instances before mentioned.</P>
<P N="2">2. A man that knows himself will see an equal necessity for self denial, in order to check and con|trol his <HI>inclinations to sinful actions:</HI> To subdue the rebel within; to rest the solicitations of sense and appetite; to summon all his wisdom to avoid the occasions and temptations to sin, and all his strength to oppose it.</P>
<P>All this (especially if it be a favourite constitu|tional iniquity) will cost a man pains and mortifi|cation enough. For instance, the subduing a vio|lent
<PB N="148" REF="025769_0148_0FCF13C012E9E758">
passion, or taming a sensual inclination, or for|giving an apparent injury and affront. It is evi|dent, such a self conquest can never be attained without, much self knowledge and self denial.</P>
<P>And that self denial that is exercised this way, as it will be a better evidence of our sincerity, so it will be more helpful and ornamental to the in|terests of religion, than the greatest zeal in those particular duties which are most suitable to our natural tempers, or than the greatest austerities in some particular instances of mortification, which are not yet so necessary, and perhaps not so dif|ficult or disagreeable to us as this.</P>
<P>To what amazing heights of piety may some be thought to mount, (raised on the wings of flaming zeal and distinguished by uncommon precisoness and severity about little things) who all the while, perhaps, cannot govern <HI>one passion,</HI> and appear yet ignorant of, and slaves to, their darling iniquity: through an ignorance of themselves, they misapply their zeal, and misplace their self denial; and by that means blemish their characters with a visible inconsistency. <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot"><P>A pious zeal may be active and yet not pernicious, and shine without burning.

<P>"Many of those who set up for wits, and pre|tend to a more than ordinary sagacity and delicacy of sense, do notwithstanding spend their time <HI>unaccountably;</HI> and live away whole days, weeks, and sometimes months together, to as little purpose, though it may not be so innocently, as if they had been asleep all the while.&mdash;But if their parts be so good as they would have others believe, sure they are <HI>worth</HI> improving; if not, they have the more need of it.&mdash;Greatness of parts is so far from being a discharge from industry, that I find men of the most exquisite sense in all ages were always most curious of their time.

<P N="9">IX. A MAN <HI>that knows himself, knows how to act with</HI> diseretion <HI>and</HI> dignity <HI>in every station and character.</HI></P>
<P>Almost all the <HI>ridicule</HI> we see in the world takes its rise from self ignorance, and to this mankind by common assent ascribe it, when they say of a person that acts out of character, <HI>he does not know himself.</HI> Affectation is the spring of all ridicule, and self ig|norance the true source of affectation. A man that does not know his proper character, nor what be|comes it, cannot act suitably to it. He will often affect a character that does not belong to him; and will either act above or beneath himself, which will
<PB N="152" REF="025769_0152_0FCF1421FAB89F90">
make him equally contemptible in the eyes of them that know him <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Omnique in re posse quod deceat acere, fartis et naturae est; scire, quid, quandoque deceat, prudentiae. Cic. de Orat. I. 3. &sect; 55.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A man of <HI>superiour</HI> rank and character, that knows himself, knows that he is but a man; subject to the same sicknesses, frailties, disappointments, pains, passions and sorrows, as other men; that true hon|our lies in those things, in which it is possible for the meanest peasant to excel him; and therefore he will not be vainly arrogant. He knows that they are only transitory and accidental things, that set him above the rest of mankind; that he will soon be upon a level with them; and therefore learns to condescend: And there is a dignity in this condescension; it does not sink, but exalts his reputation and character.</P>
<P>A man of <HI>inferiour</HI> rank, that knows himself, knows how to be content, quiet, and thankful, in his lower sphere. As he hath not an extravagant veneration and esteem for those external things which raise one man's circumstances so much above another's, so he does not look upon himself as the worse or less valuable man, purely because he has them not; much less does he envy them that have them. As he has not their advantages, so neither has he their temptations: He is in that state of life, which the great arbiter and disposer of all things hath allotted him; and he is satisfied: But as a def|ference is owing to external superiority, he knows how to pay a proper respect to those that are above him, without that abject and servile cringing which

<P><HI>Ignorance</HI> is so far from being the <HI>mother of devo|tion,</HI> that nothing is more destructive of it.

But true piety and real devotion can only spring from a just knowl|edge of GOD and ourselves; and the relation we stand in to him, and the dependence we have upon him. For when we consider ourselves as the crea|tures of GOD, whom he made for his honour, and as creatures incapable of any happiness, but what results from his favour; and as entirely and con|tinually dependent upon him for every thing we have and hope for; and whilst we bear this thought in our minds, what can induce or prompt us more to love and fear and trust Him, as our GOD, our father, and all sufficient friend and helper?</P>

<HEAD>Self Knowledge teaches us rightly to perform the Duties of Religion.</HEAD>
<P N="11">XI. SELF knowledge <HI>will be a good help and direc|tion to us in many of our</HI> devout <HI>and</HI> chris|tian <HI>exercises.</HI> Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. In the duty of <HI>prayer;</HI> both as to the <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>mode</HI> <NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">Ille De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> veram orationem exhibet qui semetipsum cog nos. cit.

"Our hearts would be the best prayer books, if we were well skilled in reading them. Why do men pray, and call for prayers when they come to die, but that they begin a little better to know themselves? And were they now but to hear the voice of GOD and conscience, they would not remain speechless. But they that are born deaf are always dumb <NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Baxter.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Again, self knowledge will teach us to pray, not only with fluency, but fervency; will help us to <HI>keep the heart,</HI> as well as <HI>order our speech</HI> before GOD; and so promote the grace as well as gift of prayer. Did we but seriously consider what we are, and what we are about; whom we pray to, and what we pray for, it is impossible we should be so dead, spiritless, and formal in this duty, as we too often are. The very thought would inspire us with life, and faith, and fervour.</P>
<PB N="156" REF="025769_0156_0FCF14267B0C8808">
<P N="2">2. Self knowledge will be very helpful to us in the duty of <HI>thanksgiving:</HI> As it shews us both how suitable and how seasonable the mercies are which we receive. A christian that keeps up an intelligence with himself, considers what he hath, as well as what he wants; and is no less sensible of the value of his mercies, than his unworthiness of them: And this is what makes him thankful. For this reason it is, that one christian's heart even melts with grat|itude for those very mercies, which others dises|teem and depreciate; and perhaps despise, because they have not what they think greater. But a man that knows himself, knows that he deserves noth|ing, and therefore is thankful for every thing. For thankfulness as necessarily flows from humility, as humility does from self acquaintance.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the duties of <HI>reading and hearing</HI> the word of GOD, self knowledge is of excellent use to ena|ble us to <HI>understand</HI> and <HI>apply</HI> that which we read, or hear. Did we understand our hearts better, we should <HI>understand</HI> the word of GOD better; for that speaks to the heart. A man that is acquainted with his own heart, presently sees how the divine word penetrates and explores, searches and lays open its most inward parts, feels what he reads; and finds that <HI>a quickening spirit,</HI> which to a self ignorant man is but a <HI>dead letter.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, this self acquaintance teaches a man to <HI>apply</HI> what he reads and hearts of the word of GOD. He sees the pertinence, congruity, and suitableness of it to his own case; and lays it up
<PB N="157" REF="025769_0157_0FCF13F806EA89D0">
faithfully in the store room of his mind, to be di|gested and improved by his after thoughts. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it is by this art of applying scripture, and urging the most suitable instructions and admonitions of it home upon our consciences, that we receive the greatest benefit by it.</P>
<P N="4">4. Nothing is of more eminent service in the great duty of <HI>meditation;</HI> especially in that part of it which consists in heart converse. A man who is unacquainted with himself, is as unfit to converse with his heart, as he is with a stranger he never saw, and whose taste and temper he is altogether unacquainted with. He knows not how to get his thoughts about him. And when he has, he knows not how to range and fix them; and hath no more the command of them, than a general has of a wild, undisciplined army, that has never been exercised, or accustomed to obedience and order. But one, who hath made it the study of his life to be acquaint|ed with himself, is soon disposed to enter into a free and familiar converse with his own heart; and in such a self conference improves more in true wisdom, and acquires more useful and substantial knowledge, than he could do from the most polite and refined conversation in the world.&mdash;Of such excellent use is self knowledge in all the duties of devotion and piety.</P>

<P>Now self knowledge, in a good degree, dissipates this gloom, and removes this dreadful doubt. For as the word of GOD hath revealed the certainty of a future state of happiness which the good man shall enter upon after death, and plainly described the requisite qualifications for it; when by a long and laborious self acquaintance, he comes distinctly to discern those qualifications in himself, his hopes of heaven soon raise him above the fears of death. And though he may not be able to form any clear or distinct conception of the nature of that happi|ness, yet in general he is assured that it will be a

But how great, how rav|ishing and transporting a pleasure this is, we cannot tell, because we never yet felt it.&mdash;Now methinks, this should not make the thoughts of death uneasy to us, should not make us unwilling to go to heaven; that the happiness of heaven is too great for us to know or conceive in this world. For men are naturally fond of un|known and untried pleasures, which is so far from being a dis|paragement to them, that it raises our expectations of them, that they are unknown. In the things of this world, enjoyment usually lessens our esteem and value for them, and we always value that most which we have never tried; and methinks the happiness of the other world should not be the only thing we despise before we try it.&mdash;It is some encouragement to us that the happiness of heaven is too big to be known in this world; for did we perfectly know it now, it could not be very great."

<HEAD>Shewing how Self Knowledge is to be attained.</HEAD>
<P>FROM what has been said under the two former parts of the subject, <HI>self knowledge</HI> appears to be in itself so excellent, and in its effects so extensive|ly useful and conducive to the happiness of human kind, that nothing need further be added by way of motive or inducement to excite us to make it the great object of our study and pursuit. If we re|gard our present peace, satisfaction, and usefulness, or our future and everlasting interests, we shall cer|tainly value and prosecute this knowledge above all others; as what will be most ornamental to our characters, and beneficial to our interest in every state of life, and abundantly recompense all our la|bour.</P>

This would soon appear by only men|tioning the reverse of those advantages before spe|cified, which result from <HI>self knowledge.</HI> For what is it, but a want of self knowledge that makes us so unsettled and volatile in our dispositions? So sub|ject to transport and excess of passions in the vary|ing scenes of life? So rash and unguarded in our conduct? So vain and self sufficient? So censori|ous and malignant? So eager and confident? So little useful in the world, in comparison of what we might be? So inconsistent with ourselves? So mis|taken in our notions of true religion? So generally indisposed to, or unengaged in the holy duties of it? And finally, so unfit for death, and so affraid of dy|ing?&mdash;I say, to what is all this owing, but <HI>self ignorance?</HI> The first and fruitful source of all this long train of evils.&mdash;And indeed, there is scarce any, but what may be traced up to it.

<P>Now then let us resolve that henceforth the study of ourselves shall be the business of our lives.

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Self Examination necessary to Self Knowledge.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>first thing necessary to</HI> self knowledge is self inspection.</P>
<P>We must often look into our hearts if we would know them. They are very deceitful; more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> than we can imagine till we have searched and tried and watched them well. We may meet with frauds and faithless dealings from men; but after all, our own hearts are the greatest cheats; and there are none we are in greater danger from than ourselves. We must first suspect ourselves, then examine ourselves, then watch ourselves, if we ex|pect ever to know ourselves. How is it possible there should be any <HI>self acquaintance</HI> without <HI>self converse?</HI></P>
<P>Were a man to accustom himself to such self employment, he need not live <HI>till thirty before he suspects himself a fool, or till forty before he knows it,</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See the Complaint, or Night Thoughts, Part 1. page 28.</NOTE></P>
<P>Men could never be so bad as they are, if they did but take a proper care and scope in this busi|ness of self examination <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Hoc nos pessimos faeit, quod nemo vitam suam respicit. Quid facturi simus, cogitamus, et id raro; quid secerimus, non cogitamus. Sen. Epist. 84.</NOTE>. If they did but look backwards to what they were, inwards to what they are, and forwards to what they shall be.</P>
<P>And as this is the first and most necessary step to self acquaintance, it may not be amiss to be a little more particular in it. Therefore,</P>
<PB N="165" REF="025769_0165_0FCF13FD932BD258">
<P N="1">1. This business of self scrutiny must be perform|ed with great <HI>care</HI> and <HI>diligence,</HI> otherwise our hearts will deceive us, even whilst we are examin|ing of them. "When we set ourselves to think, some trifle or other, presently interrupts and draws us off from any profitable recollection. Nay, we ourselves fly out, and are glad to be diverted from a severe examination into our own state; which is sure, if diligently pursued, to present us with ob|jects of shame and sorrow, which will wound our sight, and soon make us weary of this necessary work <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Stanhope's Tho. a Kempes, page 166.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Do not let us flatter ourselves then that this is a mighty easy business. Much pains and care are necessary sometimes to keep the mind intent; and more to keep it impartial. And the difficulty of it is the reason that so many are averse to it; and care not to descend into themselves <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Ut nemo id sese tentat descendcre! Pers. sat. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Reader try the experiment; retire now into thy|self; and see if thou canst not strike out some light within, by closely urging such questions as these&mdash;"What am I? For what was I made? And to what ends have I been preserved so long, by the favour of my maker? Do I remember, or forget those ends? Have I answered or perverted them?&mdash;What have I been doing since I came into the world? What is the world, or myself, the bet|ter for my living so many years in it?&mdash;What is my allowed course of actions? Am I sure it will bear the future test? Am I now in that state I
<PB N="166" REF="025769_0166_0FCF142FD5696A30">
shall wish to die in? And, O my soul, think, and think again what it is to die.&mdash;Do not put that most awful event far from thee; nor pass it by with a superficial thought. Canst thou be too well fortified against the terrours of that day! and art thou sure that the props which support thee now, will not fail thee then?&mdash;What hopes hast thou for eternity? Hast thou indeed that godly tem|per, which alone can fit thee for the enjoyment of GOD?&mdash;Which world art thou most concern|ed for? What things do most deeply affect thee?&mdash;O my soul, remember thy dignity; think how soon the scene will shift. Why shouldst thou for|get that thou art immortal?"</P>
<P N="2">2. This self excitation and scrutiny must be <HI>frequently</HI> made.&mdash;They who have a great deal of important business on their hands should often look over their accounts, and frequently ad|just them; lest they should be going backwards, and not know it. And custom will soon take off the difficulty of this duty, and make it delightful.</P>
<P>In our <HI>morning</HI> retreat it will be proper to re|member, that we cannot preserve throughout the day that calm and even temper we may then be in. That we shall very probably meet with some things to ruffle us; some attack on our weak side. Place a guard there now. Or however, if no incidents happen to discompose us, our tempers will vary; our thoughts will flow pretty much with our blood; and the dispositions of the mind be a good deal governed by the motions of the animal spirit; our
<PB N="167" REF="025769_0167_0FCF1403346B8670">
souls will be serene or cloudy, our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> volatile or phlegmatick, and our inclinations sober or ir|regular, according to the briskness or sluggishness of the circulation of the animal fluids, whatever may be the natural and immediate cause of that; and therefore we must resolve to avoid all occasions that may raise any dangerous ferments there; which, when once raised, will excite in us very different thoughts and dispositions from those we now have; which, together with the force of a fair opportunity and urgent temptation, may over|set our reason and resolution, and betray us into those sinful indulgencies which will wound the conscience, stain the soul, and create bitter remorse in our cooler reflections. Pious thoughts and pur|poses in the morning will set a guard upon the soul and fortify it under all the temptations of the day.</P>
<P>But such self inspection, however, should not fail to make part of our evening devotions. When we should review and examine the several actions of the day, the various tempers and dispositions we have been in, and the occasions that excited them. It is an advice worthy of a christian, though it first dropped from a heathen pen; that before we betake ourselves to rest, we review and examine all the passages of the day, that we may have the comfort of what we have done aright, and may redress what we find to have been amiss; and make the shipwrecks of one day, be as marks to di|rect our course on another. A practice that hath been recommended by many of the heathen moral|ists
<PB N="168" REF="025769_0168_0FCEE9DFAFF999D8">
of the greatest name, as <HI>Plutarch, Epictetus, Mar|cus Antoninus;</HI> and particularly <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> in the verses that go under his name, and are called his <HI>golden verses:</HI> Wherein he advises his scholars every night to recollect the passages of the day, and ask themselves these questions; "Wherein have I transgressed this day? What have I done? What duty have I omitted, &amp;c. <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><P><GAP DESC="foreign"></P>
<P><HI>Vid. Pythag. Aur. Carm apud Poet Minor.</HI> page 420.</P>
<LG>
<L>Let not your eyes the sweets of slumber taste</L>
<L>'Till you have thrice severe reflections past,</L>
<L>On th' actions of the day from first to last.</L>
<L><HI>Wherein have I transgress'd? What done have I?</HI></L>
<L><HI>What actions unperform'd have I past by?</HI></L>
<L>And if your actions <HI>ill,</HI> on search you find,</L>
<L>Let grief; if <HI>good,</HI> let joy possess your mind.</L>
<L>This do, this think, to this your heart incline;</L>
<L>This way will lead you to the life divine.</L>
</LG></NOTE>?" <HI>Seneca</HI> recommends the same practice. "<HI>Sectius</HI> (saith he) did this; at the close of the day, before he betook himself to rest, he addressed his soul in the following man|ner." "What evil of thine hast thou cured this day? What vice withstood? In what respect art thou better?" Passion will cease or become more cool, when it knows every day it is to be thus call|ed to account. What can be more advantageous
<PB N="169" REF="025769_0169_0FCF1404CADB6370">
than this constant custom of searching through the day?&mdash;And the same course (saith <HI>Seneca</HI>) I take myself; and every day sit in judgment on myself; and at even, when all is hush and still, I make a scrutiny into the day; look over my words and actions, and hide nothing from myself; conceal none of my mistakes through fear for why should I? When I have it in my power to say thus: "This once I forgive thee; but see thou do so no more.&mdash;In such a dispute I was too keen; do not for the future contend with ignorant men; they will not be convinced, because they are unwilling to shew their ignorance. Such a one I reproved with too much freedom; whereby I have not reformed, but exasperated him; remember hereafter to be more mild in your censures; and consider not only whether what you say be true, but whether the person you say it to, can bear to hear the truth <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Seneca de Ir&acirc;, lib. 3. cap. 36.</NOTE>."&mdash;Thus far that excellent moralist.</P>
<P>Let us take a few other specimens of a more pi|ous and christian turn, from a judicious and devout writer <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">M. Bennet. See his Christ. Orator, page 584.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"This morning, when I arose, instead of apply|ing myself to GOD in prayer, which I general|ly find it best to do, immediately after a few seri|ous reflections, I gave way to idle musing, to the great disorder of my heart and frame. How often have I suffered for want of more watchfulness on this occasion? When shall I be wise?&mdash;I have
<PB N="170" REF="025769_0170_0FCF14350C956F80">
this day shamefully trifled, almost through the, whole of it: Was in my bed when I should have been upon my knees; prayed but coolly in the morning; was strangely off my guard in the busi|ness and conversation I was concerned with in the day, particularly at&mdash;I indulged to very foolish, sinful, vile thoughts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I fell in with a strain of conversation too common amongst all sorts, <HI><ABBR>viz.</ABBR> speaking evil of others; taking up a reproach against my neighbour.</HI> I have often resolved against this sin, and yet run into it again. How treacherous this wicked heart of mine! I have lost several hours this day in mere sauntering and idleness.&mdash;This day I had an instance of mine own infirmity, that I was a little surprised at, and I am sure I ought to be humbled for. The behaviour of&mdash;, from whom I can expect nothing but humour, indiscre|tion and folly, strangely ruffled me; and that after I have had warning over and over again. What a poor, impotent, contemptible creature am I!&mdash;This day I have been kept in a great measure from my too frequent failings.&mdash;I had this day very comfortable assistances from GOD, upon an occa|sion not a little trying&mdash;what shall I render?"</P>
<P N="3">3. See that the mind be in the most composed and disengaged frame it can, when we enter upon this business of <HI>self judgment.</HI> Choose a time when it is most free from passion, and most at leis|ure from the cares and affairs of life. A judge is not like to bring a cause to a good issue, that is eith|er intoxicated with liquor on the bench, or has
<PB N="171" REF="025769_0171_0FCF1405CE805760">
his mind distracted with other cares when he should be intent on the trial. Remember you sit in judgment upon yourself, and have nothing to do at present but to sift the evidence which conscience may bring in either for or against you, in order to pronounce a just sentence; which is of much great|er concernment to you at present than any thing else can be: And therefore it should be transacted with the utmost care, composure, and attention.</P>
<P N="4">4. Beware of <HI>partiality,</HI> and the influence of self love in this weighty business; which if you do not guard against, it will soon lead you into self delu|sion; the consequences of which may be fatal to you. Labour to see yourself as you are; and view things in a just light, and not in that in which you would have them appear. Remember that the mind is always apt to believe those things which it would have to be true, and backward to credit what it wishes to be false; and this is an influ|ence you will certainly lie under in this affair of self judgment.</P>
<P>You need not be much afraid of being too severe upon yourself. Your great danger will be of pass|ing a too favourable judgment. A judge ought not indeed to be a party concerned; and should have no interest in the person he sits in judgment upon. But this cannot be the case here; as you yourself are both judge and criminal, which shews the dan|ger of pronouncing a too favourable sentence. But remember, your business is only with the evidence and the rule of judgment; and that however you
<PB N="172" REF="025769_0172_0FCF143696632BB0">
come off now, there will be a rehearing in another court, where judgment will be according to truth.</P>
<P>"However, look not unequally either at the good or evil that is in you; but view them as they are. If you observe only the good that is in you, and overlook the bad, or search only after your faults, and overlook your graces, neither of these will bring you to a true acquaintance with yourself <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Baxter's director, page 876.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>And to induce you to this impartiality, re|member that this business (though it may be hid from the world) is not done in secret; GOD sees how you manage it, before whose tribunal you must expect a righteous judgment. "We should order our thoughts so (faith <HI>Seneca</HI>) as if we had a win|dow in our breasts, through which any one might see what passes there. And indeed there is one that does; for what does it signify that our thoughts are hid from men? From God nothing is hid <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Sic cogitandum tanquam aliquis in pectus intimum in|spicere possit; et potest. Quid enim prodest ab homine aliquid esse secretum? Nihil deo clausum c. t. Sen. Epist. 84.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="5">5. Beware of <HI>false rules</HI> of judgment. This is a sure and common way to self deception. <HI>e. g.</HI> Some judge of themselves by <HI>what they have been.</HI> But it does not follow, if men are not so bad as they have been, that therefore they are good as they should be. It is wrong to make our past con|duct implicitly the measure of our present; or the present rule of our future; when our past, present, and future conduct must be all brought to another rule. And they who thus <HI>measure themselves by them|selves,
<PB N="173" REF="025769_0173_0FCF14074FE3F288">
and compare themselves with themselves, are not wise.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor x 12.</NOTE>&mdash;Again, others are apt to judge of them|selves by the <HI>opinions of men;</HI> which is the most uncertain rule that can be; for in that very opini|on of theirs you may be deceived. How do you know they have really formed so good an idea of you as they profess? But if they have, may not others have formed as bad? And why should not the judgment of <HI>these</HI> be your rule, as well as the opinion of <HI>those?</HI> Appeal to self flattery for an answer.&mdash;However, neither one nor the other of them perhaps appear even to know <HI>themselves;</HI> and how should they know you? How is it pos|sible they should have opportunities of knowing you better than you know yourself? A man can never gain a right knowledge of himself from the opinion of others, which is so various, and generally so ill founded. For men commonly judge by outward appearances, or inward prejudice, and therefore for the most part think and speak of us very much at random.&mdash;Again, others are for judging of themselves by the <HI>conduct of their superiours;</HI> who have opportunities and advantages of knowing, acting and being better; "and yet without vanity be it spoken (say they) <HI>we are not behind hand with them.</HI>" But what then? Neither they nor you perhaps are what the obligations of your character indispensably require you to be, and what you must be ere you can be happy. But consider how easily this argument may be retorted. You are
<PB N="174" REF="025769_0174_0FCF14381171E970">
better-than some, you say, who have greater op|portunities and advantages of being good than you have; and therefore your state is safe. But you yourself have greater opportunities and advantages of being good than some others have, who are never|theless better than you; and the refore, by the same rule, your state cannot be safe.&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gain, others judge of themselves by the <HI>common maxims</HI> of the vulgar world concerning honour and honesty, vir|tue and interests; which maxims, though generally very corrupt and very contrary to those of reason, conscience, and scripture, men will follow as, a rule, for the sake of the latitude it allows them: And fondly think, that if they stand right in the opinion of the lowest kind of men, they have no reason to be severe upon themselves. Others, whose sentiments are more delicate and refined, they im|agine, may be mistaken, or may overstrain the matter. In which persuasion, they are confirmed, by observing how seldom the consciences of the generality of men smite them for those things which these nice judges condemn as heinous crimes. I need not say how false and pernicious a rule this is. Again, others may judge of themselves and their state by <HI>sudden impressions</HI> they have had, or strong-impulses upon their spirits, which they attribute to the sing|er of GOD, and by which they have been so exceedingly affected as to make no doubt but that it was the instant of their conversion. But whether it was or no, can never be known but by the con|duct of their after lives.&mdash;In like manner, others
<PB N="175" REF="025769_0175_0FCF1408CBC156A0">
judge of their good state by their <HI>good frames;</HI> though very rare, it may be, and very transient; soon passing off <HI>like a morning cloud, or as the early dew.</HI> "But we should not judge of ourselves by that which is unusual or extraordinary with us; but by the ordinary tenour and drift of our lives. A bad man may seem good in some good mood; and a good man may seem bad in some extraordinary falls; to judge of a bad man by his best hours, and a good man by his worst, is the way to be deceived in them both <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Baxter's direct.</HI> p. 876</NOTE>." And the same way may you be deceived in yourself.&mdash;<HI>Pharaoh, Ahab, Herod</HI> and <HI>Felix,</HI> had all of them their softenings, their transitory fits of goodness; but yet they remain upon record under the black|est characters.</P>
<P>These then are all wrong rules of judgment; and to trust to them; or to try ourselves by them, leads to fatal self deception. Again,</P>
<P N="6">6. In the business of self examination you must not only take care you do not judge by wrong rules, but that you do not judge <HI>wrong by right rules.</HI> You must endeavour then to be well acquainted with them. The office of a judge is not only to collect the evidence and the circumstances of facts, but to he well skilled in the laws, by which those facts are to be examined.</P>
<P>Now the only right rules by which we are to ex|amine, in order to know ourselves, are <HI>reason</HI> and <HI>scripture.</HI> Some are for setting aside these rules, as too severe for them; too stiff to bend to their per|verseness;
<PB N="176" REF="025769_0176_0FCF14398C920C50">
too straight to measure their crooked ways; are against reason, when reason is against them; decrying it is <HI>carnal reason:</HI> And against scripture, when scripture is against them, despising it as a <HI>dead letter.</HI> And thus, rather than be convinc|ed they are wrong, they reject the only means that can set them right.</P>
<P>And as some are for setting aside these rules, so others are for setting them one against the other. Reason against scripture, and scripture against rea|son. When they are both given us by the GOD of our natures, not only as perfectly consistent, but as proper to explain and illustrate each other, and prevent our mistaking either; and to be, when tak|en together, (as they always should) the most com|plete and <HI>only</HI> rule by which to judge both of our|selves, and every thing belonging to our salvation, as reasonable and fallen creatures.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then one part of that rule which GOD hath given us, to judge of ourselves by, is <HI>right reason.</HI> By which I do not mean the reasoning of any par|ticular man, which may be very different from the reasoning of another particular man; and both, it may be, very different from <HI>right reason;</HI> because both may be influenced not so much by the reason and nature of things, as by partial prepossessions and the power of passions. But by <HI>right reason</HI> I mean those common principles, which are readily allowed by all who are capable of understanding them, and not notoriously perverted by the force of prejudice; and which are confirmed by the com|mon

A friend exaggerat&eacute;s a man's virtues, an enemy inflames his crimes. A wise man should give a just attention to both of them so far as it may tend to the improvement of the one, and the diminution of the other. <HI>Plutarch</HI> has written an essay on the benefits which a man may receive from his enemies; and among the good fruits of enmity mentions this in particular, that by the reproaches it casts upon us we see the worst side of ourselves, and open our eyes to several blemish|es and defects in our lives and conversations, which we should not have observed without the help of such ill natured monitors.</P>
<P>"In order likewise to come at a true knowledge of ourselves, we should consider, on the other hand, how far we may deserve the praises and approba|tions which the world bestow upon us; whether the actions they celebrate proceed from laudable and worthy motives, and how far we are really possess|ed of the virtues which gain us applause amongst those with whom we converse Such a reflection is absolutely necessary, if we consider how apt we are either to value or condemn ourselves by the opini|ons

<P>In that treatise of <HI>Plutarch</HI> here referred to, there are a great many excellent things pertinent to this subject; and therefore I thought it not improper to throw a few extracts out of it into the margin <NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot"><P>The foolish and inconsiderate spoil the very friendships they are engaged in; but the wise and prudent make good use of the hatred and enmity of men against them.</P>
<P>Why should we not take an enemy for our tutor, who will in|struct us <HI>gratis</HI> in those things we knew not before? For an enemy sees and understands more in matters relating to us than our friends do. Because love is blind, but spite, malice, ill will, wrath, and contempt, talk much, are very inquisitive and quick sighted.</P>
<P>Our enemy, to gratify his ill will towards us, acquaints himself with the infirmities both of our bodies and minds; sticks to our faults, and makes his invidious remarks upon them, and spreads them abroad by his uncharitable and ill natured reports. Hence we are taught this useful lesson for the direction and management of our conversation in the world, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that we be circumspect and wary in every thing we speak or do, as if our enemy always stood at our elbow, and overlooked our actions.</P>
<P>Those persons whom <HI>that</HI> wisdom hath brought to live soberly, which the fear and awe of enemies hath infused, are by degrees drawn into a habit of living so, and are composed and fixed in their obedience to virtue by custom and use.</P>
<P>When one asked Diogenes how he might be avenged of his ene|mies, he replied, <HI>To be yourself a good and honest man.</HI></P>
<P>Antisthenes spake incomparably well; "that if a man would live a safe and unblamable life, it was necessary that he should have very ingenuous and faithful friends, or very bad enemies; because the first, by their kind admonitions, would keep him from sinning, the latter by their invectives."</P>
<P>He that hath no friend to give him advice, or reprove him when he does amiss, must bear patiently the rebukes of his enemies, and thereby learn to end the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of his ways; considering serious|ly the object which these severe ceasures aim at, and not what he is who makes them. For he who designed the death of Prometheus the Thessalian, instead of giving him a fatal blow, only opened a swelling which he had, which did really save his life. Just so may the harsh reprehensions of enemies cure some distempers of the mind, which were be fore either not known, or neglected; though their angry speeches do originally proceed from malice or ill will.</P>
<P>If any man with opprobrious language objects to you crimes you know nothing of, you ought to inquire into the causes or reasons of such false accusations; whereby you may learn to take heed for the future, lest you should unwarily commit those offences which are unjustly imputed to you.</P>
<P>Whenever any thing is spoken against you that is not true, do not pass by, or depise it because it is false; but forthwith examine yourself, and consider what you have said or done that may admin|ister a just occasion of reproof.</P>
<P>Nothing can be a greater instance of wisdom and humanity, than for a man to bear silently and quietly the follies and revilings of an enemy; taking as much care not to provoke him, as he would to sail safely by a dangerous rock.</P>
<P>It is an eminent piece of humanity, and a manifest token of a nature truly generous, to put up the affronts of an enemy, at a time when you have a fair opportunity to revenge them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of cultivating such a Temper as will be the best Disposition to Self Knowledge.</HEAD>
<P N="5">V. IF <HI>man would know himself, he must with great care cultivate that temper which will best dispose him to receive this knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>Now as there are no greater hindrances to self knowledge than pride and obstinacy; so there is nothing more helpful to it than <HI>humility</HI> and as <HI>openness to conviction.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. One who is in quest of <HI>self, knowledge,</HI> must above all things seek <HI>humility.</HI> And how near an affinity there is between these two, appears from hence, that they are both acquired the same way. The very means of attaining <HI>humility</HI> are the properest means for attaining self acquaintance. By keeping an eye every day upon our faults and wants we become more humble; and by the same
<PB N="187" REF="025769_0187_0FCF1413BB396080">
means we become more self intelligent. By con|sidering how far we fall short of our rule and our duty, and how vastly others exceed us, and especi|ally by a daily and diligent study of the word of GOD, we come to have meaner thoughts of our|selves; and by the very same means we come to have a better acquaintance with ourselves.</P>
<P>A proud man cannot know himself. Pride is that <HI>beam</HI> in the eye of his mind, which renders him quite blind to any blemishes there. Hence nothing is a surer sign of self ignorance than vani|ty and ostentation.</P>
<P>Indeed true self knowledge and humility are so necessarily connected, that they depend upon, and mutually beget each other. A man that knows himself, knows the worst of himself, and there|fore cannot but be humble; and a humble mind is frequently contemplating its own faults and weaknesses, which greatly improves it in self knowledge: So that self acquaintance makes a man humble, and humility gives him still a bet|ter acquaintance with himself.</P>
<P N="2">2. An <HI>openness</HI> to <HI>conviction</HI> is no less necessary to self knowledge than humility.</P>
<P>As nothing is a greater bar to true knowledge than an obstinate stiffness in opinion, and a fear to depart from old notions, which (before we were capable of judging perhaps) we had long taken up for the truth; so nothing is a greater bar to self knowledge, than a strong aversion to part with those sentiments of <HI>ourselves</HI> which we have been
<PB N="188" REF="025769_0188_0FCF1444D6304858">
blindly accustomed to, and to think worse of our|selves than we are wont to do.</P>
<P>And such an unwillingness to retract our senti|ments in both cases proceeds from the same cause, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> a reluctance to self condemnation. For he that takes up a new way of thinking, contrary to that which he hath long received, therein condemns himself of having lived in an error; and he that begins to see faults in himself he never saw be|fore, condemns himself of having lived in igno|rance and sin. Now this is a most ungrateful busi|ness, and what self flattery can by no means endure.</P>
<P>But such an inflexibillity of judgment, and hat|red of conviction, is a very unhappy and hurt|ful turn of mind. And a man that is resolved nev|er to be in the wrong, is in a fair way never to be in the right.</P>
<P>As infallibility is no privilege of the human na|ture, it is no diminution to a man's good sense of judgment to be found in an errour, provided he is willing to retract it. He acts with the same free|dom and liberty as before, whoever be his moni|tor; and it is his own good sense and judgment that still guides him; which shines to great advan|tage in thus directing him against the bias of vanity and self opinion. And in thus changing his sen|timents, he only acknowledges that he is not (what no man ever was) incapable of being mistaken. In short, it is more merit, and an argument of a more excellent mind, for a man freely to retract
<PB N="189" REF="025769_0189_0FCF1414D01A9AB8">

It is only persisting in errour, or ignorance, that can hurt us.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A man then must be willing to know himself, before he can know himself. He must open his eyes, if he desires to see; yield to evidence and conviction, though it be at the expense of his judg|ment, and to the mortification of his vanity.</P>

<P>See that the <HI>light that is within you be not darkness;</HI> that your favourite and leading principles be right. Search your furniture, and consider what you have to unlearn.

<P>A scholar that hath been all his life collecting books, will find in his library at last a great deal of rubbish. And as his taste alters, and his judgment improves, he will throw out a great many as trash and lumber, which it may be, he once valued and paid dear for; and replace them with such as are more solid and useful. Just so should we deal with our understandings; look over the furniture of the mind; separate the chuff from the wheat, which are generally received into it together; and take as much pains to forget what we ought not to have learned, as to retain what we ought not to for|get. To read froth and trifles all our life, is the way always to retain a flashy and juvenile turn; and only to contemplate our first (which is generally our worst) knowledge, cramps the progress of the un|derstanding, and makes ourself survey extremely deficient. In short, would we improve the under|standing to the valuable purposes of self knowledge, we must take as much care what books we read, as what company we keep.</P>

<P><HI>Athenodorus</HI> the philosopher, by reason of his old age, begged leave to retire from the court of <HI>Augus|tus,</HI> which the emperour granted him; and in his compliments of leave, "remember (said he) <HI>Coesar,</HI> whenever you are angry; you say or do nothing, before you have distinctly repeated to yourself the four and twenty letters of the alphabet." Where|upon <HI>Coesar</HI> catching him by the hand, <HI>I have need</HI> (says he) <HI>of your presence still;</HI> and kept him a year longer <NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">See Plut. Mor.

<P><PB N="193" REF="025769_0193_0FCF1417CA54D238">It is a just and seasonable thought, that of <HI>Marcus Antoninus</HI> upon such occasions; "A man misbe|haves himself towards me&mdash;what is that to me?

<P>But after all, this amounts only to a philosoph|ical contempt of injuries; and falls much beneath the dignity of a christian forgiveness, to which self knowledge will happily dispose us.

<P N="2">2. How do you behave under a severe and un|expected <HI>affliction</HI> from the <HI>hand of providence?</HI> Which is another circumstance, wherein we have a fair opportunity of coming to a right knowledge of ourselves.</P>
<P>If there be an habitual discontent or impatience lurking within us, this will draw it forth, especial|ly if the affliction be attended with any of those aggravating circumstances which accumulated that of <HI>Job.</HI></P>

<P>It is a trite but true observation, that a wise man receives more benefit from his enemies, than from his friends; from his afflictions than from his mercies; by which means his enemies become in effect his best friends, and his afflictions his greatest mercies. Certain it is, that a man never has an opportunity of taking a more fair and undisguised view of himself, than in these circumstances. And therefore by diligently observing in what manner he is affected at such times, he may make an im|provement in the true knowledge of himself, very much to his future advantage, though perhaps not a little to his present mortification.

<P N="3">3. What is our usual temper and disposition in a time of <HI>peace, prosperity</HI> and <HI>pleasure,</HI> when the soul is generally most unguarded?</P>
<P>This is the warm season that nourishes and im|pregnates the seeds of vanity, self confidence, and a supercilious contempt of others. If there be such a <HI>root of bitterness</HI> in the heart, it will be very apt to shoot forth in the sunshine of uninterrupted prosperity; even after the frost of adversity had nipped it, and, as we thought, killed it.</P>
<P>Prosperity is a trial as well as adversity; and is commonly attended with more dangerous tempta|tions. And were the mind but as seriously dispos|ed to self reflection, it would have a greater advan|tage of attaining a true knowledge of itself under the former than under the latter. But the unhap|piness of it is, the mind is seldom rightly turned for such an employment under those circumstances. It has something else to do, has the concerns of the world to mind; and is too much engaged by the things without it, to advert to those within; and is more disposed to enjoy than <HI>examine</HI> itself. Howev|er, it is a very necessary season for self examination, and a very proper time to acquire a good degree of self acquaintance, if rightly improved.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly.</HI> How do we behave in <HI>bad company?</HI></P>
<P>And that is to be reckoned bad company in which there is no probability of our doing or get|ting

any good but apparent danger of our doing or getting much harm: I mean, our giving offence to others, by an indiscreet zeal, or incurring guilt to ourselves by a criminal compliance.</P>
<P>Are we carried down by the torrent of vanity and vice? Will a flash of wit or a brilliant fancy make us excuse a profane expression? If so, we shall soon come to relish it, when thus seasoned, and use it ourselves.</P>
<P>This is a time when our zeal and wisdom, our fortitude and firmness are generally put to the most delicate proof; and when we may too often take notice of the unsuspected escapes of folly, fickleness, and indiscretion.</P>
<P>At such seasons as these then, we may often dis|cern what lies at the bottom of our hearts, better than we can in the more even and customary scenes of life, when the passions are all calm and still. And therefore would we know ourselves, we should be very attentive to our frame, temper, disposition and conduct upon such occasions.</P>

<HEAD>The Practice of Self Knowledge, a great Means to promote it.</HEAD>
<P N="9">IX. LET <HI>all your self knowledge be reduced into prac|tice.</HI></P>
<P>The right improvement of that knowledge we have, is the best way to attain more.</P>
<P>The great end of self knowledge is self govern|ment; without which (like all other) it is but a use|less speculation. And as all knowledge is valuable in proportion to its end, so this is the most excel|lent, only because the practice of it is of the most extensive use.</P>
<P>"Above all other subjects (says an ancient pious writer) study thine own self.&mdash;For no knowledge that terminates in curiosity or speculation is com|parable to that which is of use; and of all useful knowledge, that is most so which consists in the due care and just notions of ourselves. This study is a debt which every one owes himself. Let us not then be so lavish, so unjust as not to pay this debt; by spending some part, at least, if we cannot all or most of our time and care upon that which has the most indefeasible claim to it. Govern your pas|sions; manage your actions with prudence; and where false steps have been made, correct them for the future. Let nothing be allowed to grow head|strong and disorderly; but bring all under disci|pline. Set all your faults before your eyes; and pass sentence upon yourself with the same severity

as you would do upon another, for whom no par|tiality hath biassed your judgment <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">St. Bernard's Medit. chap. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>What will our most exact and diligent self re|searches avail us, if after all, we sink into indolence and sloth? Or what will it signify to be convinced that there is a great deal amiss in our deportments and dispositions, if we sit still contentedly under that conviction, without taking one step towards a reformation? It will indeed render us but the more guilty in the sight of GOD. And how sad a thing will it be to have our <HI>self knowledge</HI> hereafter rise up in judgment against us?</P>
<P>"Examination is in order to correction and amendment. We abuse it and ourselves, if we rest in the duty without looking farther. We are to re|view our daily walk, that we may <HI>reform</HI> it; and consequently a daily review will point out to us the subject and matter of our suture daily care."&mdash;"This day" (saith the christian upon his review of things at night) "I lost so much time; particularly at&mdash;I took too great a liberty; particularly in&mdash;I omitted such an opportunity that might have been improved to better purpose. I mismanaged such a duty&mdash;I find such a corruption often work|ing; my old infirmity&mdash;still cleaves to me: How easily doth this sin beset me!&mdash;Oh! may I be more attentive for the time to come, more watch|ful over my heart! take mine heed to my ways! May I do so the next day!"&mdash;"The knowledge of a distemper is a good step to accure: at least it directs to proper methods and applications in or|der

to it. Self acquaintance leads to self reforma|tion. He that at the close of each day calls over what is past, inspects himself, his behaviour and manners, will not fall into that security, and those uncensured follies that are so common and so dan|gerous <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Bennet's Christ. Orat. page 578.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>And it may not be improper, in order to make us sensible of and attentive to some of the more secret faults and foibles of our tempers, to pen them down at night, according as they appeared during the transactions of the day. By which means, we shall not only have a more distinct view of that part of our character to which we are generally most blind; but shall be able to discover some defects and blemish|es in it, which perhaps we never apprehended be|fore. For the wiles and doublings of the heart are sometimes so hidden and intricate, that it requires the nicest care and most steady attention to detect and unfold them.</P>
<P>For instance: "This day I read an author, whose sentiments were very different from mine, and who expressed himself with much warmth and confidence. It excited my spleen, I own, and I immediately passed a severe censure upon him. So that had he been present, and talked in the same strain, my ruffled temper would have prompted me to use harsh and ungrateful language, which might have occasioned a very unchristian contention. But I now recollect, that though the author might be mistaken in those sentiments, (as I still believe he was) yet by his particular circumstances in life, and
<PB N="202" REF="025769_0202_0FCEE9E7B7064208">
the method of his education, he has been strongly led into that way of thinking. So that his prejudice is pardonable; but my uncharitableness is not; es|pecially considering that in many respects he has the ascendant of me.&mdash;This proceeded then from <HI>uncharitableness,</HI> which is one fault of my temper I have to watch against; and which I never was be|fore so sensible of, as I am now upon this recollec|tion. Learn more <HI>moderation,</HI> and make more allow|ances for the mistaken opinions of others for the future. Be as charitable to others who differ from you, as you desire they should be to you who dif|fer as much from them. For it may be you cannot be more assured of being in the right than they are."</P>
<P>"Again; this day I found myself strongly inclined to put in something by way of abatement to an ex|cellent character given of an absent person, by one of his great admirers. It is true I had the command of myself to hold my tongue, and it is well I had, for the ardour of his zeal would not have admitted the exception, (though I still think that in some de|gree it was just) which might have raised a wrang|ling debate about his character, perhaps at the ex|pense of my own; or however occasioned much animosity and contention.&mdash;But I have since exa|mined the secret spring of that impulse, and find it to be <HI>envy;</HI> which I was not then sensible of; but my antagonist had certainly imputed it to this: And had he taken the liberty to have told me so, I much question whether I should have had the tem|per of the philosopher; who, when he was really
<PB N="203" REF="025769_0203_0FCEE9E944B93E68">
injured, being asked whether he was angry or no, replied, <HI>No; but I am considering with myself whether I ought not to be so.</HI> I doubt I should not have had so much composure, but should have immediately re|sented it as a false and malicious aspersion; but it was certainly envy, and nothing else; for the per|son who was the object of the encomium was much my superiour in many respects. And the exception that arose to my mind was the only flaw in his cha|racter; which nothing but a quick sighted envy could descry. Take heed then of that vice for the future."</P>
<P>"Again; this day I was much surprised to observe in myself the symptoms of a vice, whcih of all oth|ers, I ever thought myself most clear of; and have always expressed the greatest detestation of in oth|ers, and that is <HI>covetousness.</HI> For what else could it be that prompted me to withhold my charity from my fellow creature in distress, on pretence that he was not in every respect a proper object; or to dis|pense it so sparingly to another, who I knew was so, on pretence of having lately been at a consider|able expense upon another occasion? This could proceed from nothing else but a latent principle of covetousness; which, though I never before observed in myself, yet it is likely others have. O how inscrutable are the depths and deceits of the human heart!&mdash;Had my enemy brought against me a charge of indolence, self indulgence, or pride and impatience, or a too quick resentment of affronts and injuries, my own heart must have confirmed
<PB N="204" REF="025769_0204_0FCF1459D34BC608">
the accusation, and forced me to plead guilty. Had he charged me with bigotry, self opinion, and cen|soriousness, I should have thought it proceeded from the same temper in <HI>himself,</HI> having rarely observed any thing like it in my own. But had he charged me with covetousness, I should have taken it for downright <HI>calumny,</HI> and despised the censure with indignation and triumph. And yet after all, I find it had been but too true a charge.&mdash;Oh! how hard a thing is it to know myself!&mdash;This, like all other knowledge, the more I have of it, the more sensi|ble I am of my want of it." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cicero</HI> was without doubt the vainest man in life; or he never could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the face to beseech Lucceius, in writing the Roman history, to set the administrations of his consulship in the most distinguished point of glory, even at the expense of historical truth; and yet when he is begging a favour of the like kind even of Cato himself, he has these astonishing words:&mdash;Si quisquam fuit un|quam remotus et natur&acirc; et magis etiam (ut mihi quidem sentire vi|deor) ratione atque doctrina ab INANI LAUDE ET SERMONIRUS VULGI, ego profecto is sum, lib. 15. Ep. 4. <HI>If ever any man was a</HI> STRANGER TO VAIN GLORY, <HI>and the desire of popular applause it is myself; and this disposition which I have by nature, is (methinks) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> yet stronger by reason and philosophy.</HI>&mdash;Ah! how secretly doth self ignorance (not only insinuate into, but) conceal itself within the most improved and best cultivated minds.&mdash;Reader, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE></P>
<P>The difficulty of self government and self posses|sion arises from the difficulty of a thorough self ac|quaintance, which is necessary to it. I say a <HI>tho|rough</HI> self acquaintance, such as has been already set forth in its several branches, (Part I.) For as self government is simply impossible (I mean consider|ed as a virtue) where self ignorance prevails so the
<PB N="205" REF="025769_0205_0FCEE9EAEDA38478">
difficulty of it will decreas&egrave; in proportion to the degree in which self acquaintance improves.</P>
<P>Many, perhaps may be ready to think this a pa|radox; and imagine that they know their predom|inant passions and foibles very well, but still find it extremely difficult to correct them. But let them examine this point again, and perhaps they may find, that <HI>that</HI> difficulty arises either from their <HI>de|fect</HI> of self knowledge (for it is in this as in other kinds of knowledge, wherein some are very ready to think themselves much greater proficients than they are) or else from their <HI>neglect</HI> to put in prac|tice that degree of self knowledge they have. They know their particular failings, yet will not guard against the immediate temptations to them. And they are often betrayed into the immediate tempta|tions which overcome them, because they are igno|rant of, or do not guard against, the more <HI>remote</HI> temptations, which lead them into those which are more immediate and dangerous, which may not improperly be called the temptations to temptations; in observing and guarding against which, consists a very necessary part of self knowledge, and the great art of keeping clear of danger, which, in our pres|ent state of frailty, is the best means of keeping clear of sin.</P>
<P>To correct what is amiss, and to improve what is good in us, is supposed to be our hearty desire, and the great end of all our self research. But if we do not endeavour after this, all our labour after self knowledge will be in vain. Nay, if we do
<PB N="206" REF="025769_0206_0FCF145B647ECDD0">
not endeavour it, we cannot be said heartily to de|sire it. "For there is most of the heart where there is most of the will; and there is most of the will, where there is most endeavour; and where there is most endeavour, there is generally most success: So that endeavour must prove the truth of our de|sire, and success will generally prove the sincerity of our endeavour <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Baxter.</NOTE>." This, I think, we may safely say, without attributing too much to the pow|er of the human will, considering that we are ra|tional and free agents, and considering what effec|tual assistance is offered to them, who seek it, to render their endeavours successful, if they are sin|cere; which introduces the subject of the following chapter.</P>

<HEAD>Fervent and frequent Prayer the most effectual Means for attaining true Self Knowledge.</HEAD>
<P>LASTLY, <HI>the last means to self knowledge which I shall mention is frequent and devout applications to the Fountain of Light, and the Father of our spirits, to as|sist us in this important study, and give us the</HI> true knowledge <HI>of ourselves.</HI></P>
<P>This I mention last, not as the least, but, on the contrary, as the greatest and best means of all, to at|tain a right and thorough knowledge of ourselves, and the way to render all the rest effectual, and there|fore
<PB N="207" REF="025769_0207_0FCEE9EC6166FAC8">
though it be the last means mentioned, it is the first that should be used.</P>
<P>Would we know ourselves, we must often con|verse not only with ourselves in meditation, but with GOD in prayer; in the lowest prostration of soul, beseeching the father of our spirits to discover them to us; <HI>in whose light we may see light,</HI> where before there was nothing but darkness; to make known to us the depth and devices of our heart. For with|out the grace and influence of his divine illumina|tions and instructions, our hearts will, after all our care and pains to know them, most certainly deceive us. And self love will so prejudice the understand|ing, as to keep us still in self ignorance.</P>
<P>The first thing we are to do in order to self knowl|edge is, to assure ourselves that our hearts <HI>are deceit|ful above all things.</HI> And the next is, to remember that <HI>the Lord searcheth the hearts, and trieth the reins,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. xvii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">0.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> that He, the (<GAP DESC="foreign">) <HI>Searcher of all hearts,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. xxviii. 9.</NOTE> hath a perfect knowledge of them, deceitful as they are; which consideration, as it suggesteth to us the strongest motive to induce us to labour af|ter a true knowledge of them ourselves; so it di|rects us at the same time how we may attain this knowledge; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> by an humble and importunate application to Him, to whom <HI>alone</HI> they are known, to make them known to us. And this, by the free and near access which his holy spirit hath to our spirits, he can effectually do various ways; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> by fixing our attentions; by quickening our appre|hensions; removing our prejudices, (which, like a
<PB N="208" REF="025769_0208_0FCF145CD89BE570">
false medium before the eye of the mind, prevents its seeing things in a just and proper light;) by mortifying our pride; strengthening the intellective and reflecting faculties; and enforcing upon the mind, a lively sense and knowledge of its greatest happiness and duty; and so awakening the soul from that carnal security and indifference about its best interests, into which a too serious attention to the world is apt to betray it.</P>
<P>Besides, prayer is a very proper expedient for attaining <HI>self knowledge,</HI> as the actual engagement of the mind in this devotional exercise is in itself a great help to it. For the mind is never in a better frame, than when it is intently and devoutly engag|ed in this duty; it has then the best apprehensions of GOD, the truest notions of itself, and the just|est sentiments of earthly things; the clearest con|ceptions of its own weakness, and the deepest sense of its own vileness; and consequently is in the best disposition that can be, to receive a true and right knowledge of itself.</P>
<P>And Oh! could we but always think of ourselves in such a manner, or could we but always be in a disposition to think of ourselves in such a manner, as we sometimes do in the servour of our humilia|tions before the throne of grace, how great a pro|gress should we soon make in this important science? Which evidently shews the necessity of such devout and humble engagements of the soul, and how hap|py a means they are to attain a just <HI>self acquaintance.</HI></P>
