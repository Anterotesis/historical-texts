<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Remarks</HI> contained in the following Pages were, for the Sum and Scope of them, drawn up soon after the Discourse, to which they refer, was published, with an Intent then quickly to offer them to publick View. In doing of which, I had no Design to enter into a personal Contest with the Au|thor, or any others that may be Like-minded with him: but only to <HI>contend for the Faith, delivered to the Saints,</HI> in the Days of the Apostles, and primitive Times of Chris|tianity; which also has been handed down to the Churches of the Saints in <HI>New-England,</HI> by those eminent Worthies, that were Instruments in the Hand of Christ to spread the Knowledge of those important Doctrines revealed and strongly recommended in the Gospel, which have been ge|nerally received and professed, not in this Land only, but in all the Churches of the Reformation. However, my De|pendance is not upon human Tradition or Antiquity, with Respect to these Doctrines, that are now by some so much decryed and condemn'd, yea, even ridicul'd: But on the pure and unerring <HI>Word of</HI> GOD; as firmly believing them to be therein discovered, ratify'd and confirmed by Inspi|ration of the Holy Ghost.&mdash;My main Design in the Re|marks before us, is, by divine Assistance, (according to my Measure) to vindicate those <HI>Doctrines</HI> of our holy Religi|on, so misrepresented and treated with so much Contempt in the Discourse under our Examination; and to remove the groundless and injurious Reflections cast on the whole Body of excellent Protestant <HI>Expositors, Ministers,</HI> and <HI>Pro|fess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rs,</HI> in general, of the last and former Age; and also, if possible, to put a Stop to the prevailing Contagion of <HI>Ar|minian</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="006902_0003_0F6726A8765633B8">
Errors and other loose Opinions among us, which threaten to banish vital Piety out of the Land.&mdash;Some worthy Gentlemen in the Ministry among us entering into the Controversy, and engaging (as I apprehend) on the Side of Truth, this occasioned my <HI>delaying</HI> to publish my Remarks; hoping, what was published by them, might lead our Opponent into a laudable Retracta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ion. But my Hopes in that Case soon vanished, upon his publishing a (pretended) <HI>Vindication</HI> of his Sentiments, not so much by fair <HI>Scripture-Argument</HI> (which, I suppose, he found im|possible) as by <HI>Banter,</HI> and by <HI>personal</HI> Reflection and In|vective, which doubtless he readily concluded to be much the easiest Method, and perhaps most agreeing to his Genius and Capacity.</P>
<P>The Time of this Delay gave me Opportunity to review what I had wrote, &amp; to exhibit the same to the Publick with considerable <HI>Enlargement</HI> on several Heads of Remark; by which Means, this Work is much lengthier than I at first purposed: Yet I hope, it may not be the less useful, to such as have not fallen into the <HI>dangerous Scheme</HI> I am op|posing, and perhaps may minister some Caution to such as are in Danger to be led away by those <HI>Self-pleasing Notions,</HI> so industriously propagated in this Day of Degeneracy. The Prevalence of sundry pernicious Errors, tending to the Subversion of our holy Religion, is <HI>for a Lamentation, and shall be for a Lamentation,</HI> unto all the true Lovers of <HI>Zion,</HI> and Friends to the Churches of Christ in <HI>New-Eng|land.</HI> Truly sorrowful is the State of some of our Churches, who have <HI>Ministers</HI> set over them, that contest, and even deny, yea, I may say, deride some of the <HI>grand Articles</HI> of our holy Profession, as they are exhibited in the <HI>Assembly'</HI>s <HI>Catechism</HI> (commonly so called) tho' the Doctrines con|tested are so plainly according to <HI>Scripture.</HI> Therefore it is, that some (we hope, not many) who have taken on them the <HI>pastoral Charge,</HI> do neglect the <HI>Lambs</HI> of those Flocks under their Care, by declining to instruct them in the private Way, by <HI>Catechising;</HI> and this in Places where the former Ministers were wont to make Conscience of at|tending this Work, as a Part of their <HI>ministerial Duty.</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="3" REF="006902_0004_0F6726A92164D400">
This Practice has obtained not only here in <HI>New-England,</HI> but in all the <HI>reformed Churches</HI> abroad. Unto this lauda|ble, and necessary Practice (as I think it to be) I can give some Evidence. When I resided in this Town of <HI>Braintree</HI> at first, and was at School here, it was the known constant Method of the Rev. Mr. FISK, the then worthy Minister here, to appoint certain Times for the instructing the Children and Youth in the <HI>Catechism;</HI> the Benefit whereof I enjoy'd together with others.&mdash;And this religious and commendable Service was keptup by those worthy Ministers that succeeded him, the Rev. Mr. MARSH and Mr. HAN|cock. But now, I am informed, it is wholly <HI>laid aside;</HI> which must lie as a Reproach both upon Minister, and People, where it is indulged; as well as must be a dreadful Injury to the Souls of the poor Children, so <HI>shamefully</HI> and <HI>barbarously</HI> neglected.&mdash;Some Reasons of my Judg|ment I shall presently offer.&mdash;Another Instance or two I will mention of the like tender <HI>Care</HI> &amp; <HI>Fidelity</HI> of godly Ministers, to the Souls of the Children and young People under their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Charge. When I was under the Tuition of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ev. Mr. HOBART of <HI>Newtown,</HI> whose Memory and Character will ever be dear to me, which was when I was more capable of observing &amp; making a Judg|ment on the Conduct of Ministers, in this Point of <HI>Catechising;</HI> his Method was to appoint a Time for the <HI>Children</HI> to attend this Service;&amp;also for the young People, Males &amp;Females, grown to <HI>Men's</HI> and <HI>Women's</HI> Estate. These, in their several Turns, all attended <HI>Catechising.</HI> Moreover, he was wont to <HI>explain</HI> and <HI>apply</HI> the Doctrines and Duties, held forth in the <HI>Catechism,</HI> at the same Time.&mdash;Another Instance of constant and indefatigable Care and Pains in <HI>Catechising,</HI> was my deservedly much honoured Father-in-Law, the Rev. Mr. THACHER of <HI>Milton;</HI> whose Example in this and all other Acts of Piety and Faithfulness, towards not only his own People, but the <HI>Indian</HI> Tribe, both young and old, at <HI>Punkapaug,</HI> and <HI>Packenee,</HI> as they were then called, now <HI>Stoug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ton,</HI>&mdash;I say, his Example, with that of the other venerable Fathers &amp; memorable Brethren above mentioned, and the rest of Christ's Ministers among us,
<PB N="4" REF="006902_0005_0F6726A9DD7365F0">
in general, is certainly worth the Notice &amp; Imitation of their Successors, and of all that sustain the ministerial Character.&mdash;Nor wou'd I omit mentioning on this Occasion, the great Service done the World, by that excellent Minister of Jesus Christ, the Rev. Mr. WILLARD, in his elaborate <HI>Exposition</HI> on the <HI>Catechism:</HI> wherein all its Instructions are confirmed by Scripture-Proofs, and with nervous Ar|guments, sufficient for the Conviction of all Gainsayers.</P>
<P>But now, as my Sentiments in the Case I am upon, are not built on <HI>Tradition,</HI> or the Authority of our Fathers, I shall offer some of the Reasons of my Opinion. I ap|prehend it very obvious, what <HI>evil Consequences</HI> will neces|sarily follow the <HI>Omission</HI> of instructing Children, in the <HI>Ca|techism.</HI> It is well known, that <HI>Catechising</HI> has been of long and singular <HI>Use</HI> among us: the <HI>Advantages</HI> thereof Mul|titudes are ready from their own Experience to <HI>witness</HI> to. As it has ever been esteem'd by the Ministers in these Churches, a Part of their ministerial Work to <HI>Catechise</HI> the Children of their Congregations, as well as to instruct el|der Persons by publickly preaching the Word of God, they have grounded their Judgment partly on that solemn <HI>Charge</HI> our Saviour laid upon <HI>Peter</HI> as a leading Minister, and for a Test of his <HI>Love</HI> to Christ, (Joh. 21. 15<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">) <HI>Feed my Lambs.</HI> These are a Part of the <HI>Flock:</HI> and it is to be noted, here the <HI>Lambs</HI> are set before the <HI>Sheep;</HI> which might be designed to shew the tender Care Christ had par|ticularly of <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>young People,</HI> who, to answer the Metaphor, must be principally intended by the <HI>Lambs</HI> of the Flock. Agreable to this is that Charge given to Mi|nisters, and usually laid on them at their Ordination, <HI>Feed the Flock of God which is among you;</HI> the young, as well as old, under your pastoral Care. See 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5. 2. Or as it is express't, <HI>Act.</HI> 20. 28. <HI>Take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eed unto your selves, and to all the Flock;</HI> of which the <HI>Children</HI> are a great, growing Part, and a <HI>hopeful</HI> Part, when well instructed in the Prin|ciples of Religion, by <HI>Catechising.</HI>&mdash;We may also see (to the Shame of such as habitually neglect this important Part of their Duty) how emphatically <HI>Christ,</HI> the Head-Shep|herd o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Flock, both Sheep and Lambs, has answered
<PB N="5" REF="006902_0006_0F6726AAA9063A50">
his Character and Trust, and left an Example to all his Ministers or Under-Shepherds, in fulfilling so exactly in his personal Ministry on Earth, and leaving the same in Charge to his Ministers, what was predicted of old by the Prophet concerning him, Isai. 40. 11. <HI>He shall food <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">his Flock, like a Shepherd: He shall gather the Lambs with his Arm, and carry them in his Bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.</HI></P>
<P>Ministers, Parents, or Tutors neglecting this Branch of their Duty is an inexpressible <HI>Injury</HI> to the Souls of the <HI>Youth</HI> thus neglected. <HI>That the Soul be without Knowledge, it is not good.</HI> And what better Expedient can be found, to promote the <HI>good Knowledge of God,</HI> in the Minds of young Ones, than the Means I am pleading for? How otherwise can <HI>the Lambs</HI> be said to <HI>feed after their Manner?</HI> (Isai. 5. 17.) Or, the <HI>Kids</HI> be said in a Scripture-Sense to <HI>feed beside the Shepherds Tents?</HI> (Cant. 1. 8.) Or can any sup|pose, that the Knowledge <HI>Timothy</HI> had of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> consisted only in a meer <HI>literal</HI> Knowledge, by the bare reading of them? and not rather, that he had been well in|structed from his <HI>Childhood,</HI> in the <HI>Contents</HI> of the Bible, especially the great <HI>Truths</HI> contained in the <HI>Holy Scriptures;</HI> and that those Doctrines were received by him and rested on by Faith? Otherwise they cou'd not have had such an happy Effect on him, as <HI>to make him wise unto Salvation.</HI> The Knowledge <HI>Timothy</HI> had in the holy Scriptures, we may justly conclude, was through the pious Care of his Parents, his Grand-mother <HI>Lois,</HI> and his Mother <HI>Eunice</HI> (2 Epi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t. 1. 5.) who are set as Examples, of carefully in|structing Children in Religion.</P>
<P>Moreover, an Omission of this Duty towards Children, will necessarily and by inevitable Consequence, not only be a Means to rase the Foundations of <HI>Zion,</HI> but tend to banish <HI>true Religion,</HI> and bring in <HI>Heathenism</HI> like a mighty Flood upon a People. For, it is beyond all Contradiction, I suppose, generally speaking, that many Parents, and such as are charged with the Education of Children, are too r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and negligent in teaching them the Knowledge of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>Scripture,</HI> and promoting them in learning their

<HI>Catechism,</HI> for their early Acquaintance with the <HI>Things of God</HI> and the Religion of <HI>Jesus:</HI> And what a wonderful gratifying <HI>Indulgence</HI> must it be to such Parents and others, when their <HI>Minister</HI> tells them (practically at least, if not verbally) that the <HI>Catechism</HI> is corrupt, containing false Points of Doctrine (as some in this evil Day pretend) and that he <HI>dare not teach the Children what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e himself does not believe:</HI> Or else excuses himself from <HI>Catechising</HI> them, by a more plausible Pretence, <HI>That it is no Part of a Minister's Work!</HI>&mdash;These and such like Evasions in Mi|nisters, bear a near Resemblance with <HI>Jerob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">am's</HI> carnal Policy to secure his Authority over the People; of whom it is said&mdash;<HI>Who sinned &amp; made Israel to sin.</HI>&mdash;Such Ministers are in danger of the like Character with his, who is also said to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ive Israel to Sin,</HI> and <HI>from following the Lord.</HI> (2 Kin. 17. 21.) He perswades them, that it was <HI>too far for them to go up to</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>to worship</HI> after the Manner which God had appointed: therefore sets up <HI>Golden Calves,</HI> under a corrupt Pretence, that <HI>these were the Gods that brought them out of the Land of Egypt;</HI> and so drew the Body of that People into Idolatry, which probably he learnt in <HI>Egypt,</HI> when he fled thither for fear of <HI>Solomon.</HI> And this their Idolatry continued until God sent them into Captivity, for their Apostacy, in casting off and forsaking the true Wor|ship he had appointed, and setting up a Religion of their own<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;The Example of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and the high Encomium God gives of him and his Conduct, respecting the Case I am upon, is worthy the Imitation of Parents, Ministers, and all others, to whom the Education of Children or In|struction of Youth is committed. See <HI>Gen.</HI> 18. 19. <HI>I know him, that he will command his Children and his Houshold after him, and they shall keep the Way of the Lord.</HI> Parents should <HI>train up</HI> their Children in the <HI>Way of Truth,</HI> if they wou'd not have them <HI>depart from it when they are old.</HI> (Prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 22. 6.) They should labour to <HI>bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</HI> (Eph. 6. 4.) But how can Parents do thus, if by the Instigation of their <HI>Minister,</HI> by his Example, or by any other Means, they are led to neglect teaching their Children the very <HI>first Principles of
<PB N="7" REF="006902_0008_0F6726ACDD1816F0">
the Oracles of God?</HI> Which are in an excellent Order and a clear compendious Manner exhibited in the <HI>Catechism,</HI> that has been mostly in Use among us, and highest in Esteem with the generality of Churches in <HI>New-England.</HI> Alas, what we read in <HI>Lam.</HI> 4. 3, 4. I think is applicable in the Case before us; <HI>Even the Sea-Monsters draw out the Breast, they give suck to their young Ones: the Daugh|ter of my People is become cruel, like the Ostriches in the Wil|derness.&mdash;The young Children ask Bread, and no Man break|eth it unto them.</HI>&mdash;This seems to be the <HI>lamentable Case</HI> with poor Children, when the <HI>Catechism</HI> is thrown out of its wonted commendable and necessary Improvement for Soul-advantage to Children. And what can be ex|pected to follow, but <HI>Vice, Ignorance</HI> &amp; <HI>Atheism?</HI>&mdash;Thus Parents entail their Sin on their miserable Offspring: and give them Example, to do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to their Children. (<HI>Ezek.</HI> 16. 44.)</P>
<P>Before I dismiss this Point, I shall make one brief Ob|servation upon it, which I suppose few will deny to be just:&mdash;Had this Neglect of <HI>Catechising</HI> the Children been proved upon any <HI>Minister</HI> in these Churches, though under any Pretences whatsoever, before our venerable Fa|thers in the Ministry of the last Age, or their Predecessors, in <HI>New-England,</HI> when convened in Council, they would have thought it necessary immediately to dismiss such Mi|nister from his Pastoral Office: And supposing the Church he was set over, should refuse to concur with their Deter|minations in this Case, I believe, then such a Church wou'd be deem'd unworthy of Communion with the other Church|es, as having in Effect denied the Faith, and made them|selves accessary to the promoting of such <HI>Ignorance</HI>&amp; <HI>Error,</HI> as I think to be inconsistent with and destructive of that vital Religion, for which our Ancestors were famous, and this People were once greatly renown'd. Certainly such an Omission must be judged by all sober and well Princi|pled Persons, not only <HI>irreligious</HI> in Ministers, &amp;Parents, but even <HI>inhuman</HI> and <HI>barbarous,</HI> to the Souls of their Children! Who can account for it! How can it be excused! I truly think, Ministers, or Parents, or others that have the Care
<PB N="8" REF="006902_0009_0F6726B052E85CD0">
of educating Youth, if they habitually don't practise this Duty of <HI>Catechising,</HI> have <HI>no Cloke for their Sin.</HI> Neither can we rationally expect better Times, without a Reformation in this Matter.&mdash;I shall only add one Word further upon it, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> If the <HI>Minister</HI> in any Place will not be persuaded to attend his Duty in this Point, <HI>Heads of Families</HI> will do well to take the more Pains in <HI>catechising</HI> their Children and Servants at Home; and in doing it, to make frequent Use of some familiar <HI>Exposition</HI> of the <HI>Catechism,</HI> for the safer and clearer explaining Things to them, as they go a|long. There are many Books of this Kind to be had; which might be of singular Service, if made more Use of, to spread the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of divine Things, among elder People, as well as young ones, and to secure them in the <HI>Belief of the Truth.</HI> For, if by such Helps they become well acquainted with the great Doctrines and Duties of Christianity, as they will the better understand the Ser|mons of their Minister on these Subjects, so they will be the more capable of distinguishing between <HI>Truth</HI> &amp; <HI>Error;</HI> and if they should sometimes hear any Thing advanced in Discourses from the Pulpit, <HI>contrary to sound Doctrine,</HI> or leading to <HI>dangerous Errors,</HI> the well-instructed <HI>Youth</HI> would be less exposed to receive <HI>ill Impressions</HI> therefrom, or at least their more judicious and faithful <HI>Parents</HI> would be able to fortify and guard them, and I hope would take Care to do it seasonably and effectually, as knowing that they (as well as the Minister) must give Account.</P>
<P>It may not be altogether impertinent or unseasonable, if I now take Occasion to mention it as another dark Omen, and a Symptom of the declining State of Religion in this Land, that our wonted <HI>Lectures</HI> on Week-days are of late so much laid aside, or neglected, and practically despised among us. In some Places, perhaps the <HI>Minister</HI> may vo|luntarily omit them, either by Reason of his <HI>Support's</HI> be|ing too scanty to allow of the Expence usually arising on such Occasions, or because the Burden of <HI>Labour</HI> created hereby takes him too much off from other (as he thinks) more necessary Parts of his Ministry, or else because he is discouraged by the thin Appearance of <HI>Auditors,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="9" REF="006902_0010_0F6726B117F531A8">
And undoubtedly the <HI>People</HI> are very much to Blame&punc; For eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">here the Minister is not at all in Fault, but re|solutely surmounting all Difficulties in his Way, as being chearfully willing to <HI>spend</HI> and be <HI>spent</HI> in the Cause of Christ and for the Good of Souls, diligently keeps up his stated <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">re,</HI> yet how frequently do's he see it <HI>poorly at|tended,</HI> and finds herein a great Discouragement to his La|bours, as it soems a practical Contempt of the Means of Grace, and an Argument of a sad Prevalence of the Spirit of this World among his People? Indeed it must needs be a Sign of the sorrowful Change of State in Point of vi|sible Godliness thro' the Land, unto all those who are <HI>trem|bling for the Ark of God,</HI> and who have seen the crouded Assemblies for Worship on <HI>Lecture-days</HI> (as well as on <HI>Lord's-days</HI>) in former Times, now to see the Degeneracy this People are fallen into, by the general Neglect of such Opportunities for the Exercises of Religion and the Care of their Souls. Which Neglect shamefully prevails, not only in many Country-Towns, but even in our <HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ropolis</HI> also, the chief Place of Concourse; where tho' in a Judg|ment of Charity there be some Thousands of devout Souls, yet it was surprizing to me to behold (as I lately did) at their <HI>Thursday-Lecture,</HI> the Pews and Seats in a Manner empty; and this, notwithstanding some Pains have lately been taken (as I am informed) to revive that ancient <HI>Lectures,</HI> particularly by reprinting and dispersing an excellent Dis|course of the memorable and Rev.Mr. JOSHUA MOODEY'S on <HI>the choice Benefit of Communion with God in his House;</HI> thought to be very well calculated to that Purpose, and ac|companied with a recommendatory <HI>Preface,</HI> by sundry Re|verend and worthy Ministers of <HI>Boston,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Dr.<HI>Sewall,</HI> Mr. <HI>Prince,</HI> and the late Mr. <HI>Webb.</HI> Whose pathetick Wishes therein expressed, it is not unreasonable here to repeat, in their own Words, which are these. <Q>May the <HI>Ministers</HI> of Christ be intreated to do their utmost to revive our <HI>first Love</HI> for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ouse of God, by insisting on the <HI>great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ruths of the</HI> GOSPEL; such are, the Doctrines of the <HI>Divinity</HI> and saving <HI>Offices</HI> of our Lord JESUS, God-Man Mediator; concerning the <HI>Godhead</HI> and divine <HI>Operations</HI>

<P>On this Occasion, I would take the Liberty (which, I hope, I may do without Offence) humbly to suggest, that as there is a <HI>Charity-Lecture,</HI> annually at the Ministers Con|vention on the Day after the General Election, one View of which is to promote the <HI>Collection</HI> then expected, for the Support of some Ministers that have a difficult Situa|tion, but small Congregations and so but small Salaries, if our honoured Patriots at the <HI>Council-Board</HI> and in the House of <HI>Representatives,</HI> taking the Case into Consideration, would be pleased, as many of them as might be, to coun|tenance so useful a Charity by attending that <HI>Lecture</HI> in particular, and giving their <HI>Contribution,</HI> as several Mem|bers of that honourable Body and others of distinguish'd Character, I know, have sometimes done, and therein have not a little honoured themselves, this doubtless would be a <HI>Sacrifice well pleasing to God thro' Jesus Christ;</HI> and such a laudable <HI>Pattern</HI> in our civil Leaders and principal Gen|tlemen might happily be the Means of diffusing a Spirit of Liberality, and draw in many to imitate them, in <HI>honouring the Lord with their Substance</HI> on such Occasions; which would be Matter of <HI>abundant Thanksgivings to God,</HI> espe|cially from those who receive these yearly Benefactions.&mdash;I hope, it will be excused, if I take the Freedom to add here, that a <HI>Concio ad Clerum</HI> being partly the Design of this annual <HI>Lecture,</HI> I trust, it will from Time to Time be the Care of the <HI>Minister</HI> who preaches it, to <HI>exemplify</HI> and <HI>recommend</HI> on that Occasion the <HI>evangelical Preacher,</HI> and lay hold of that Opportunity for bearing his faithful Tes|timony,

as in Behalf of the peculiar Doctrines and Duties of <HI>Christianity,</HI> which should chiefly fill our Pulpit-Discour|ses, so likewise against the growing Errors, Neglects, and Miscarriages of the Day, whether among Ministers or People.</P>
<P>But to return to the special Business of this Preface&mdash;</P>
<P>As the Growth of <HI>Armini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nism</HI> and loose Principles in Religion among us, tends to the utter Ruin of these Church|es, in Point of Faith, Worship, and vital Godliness, I have for my own Part determined, while Opportunity continues, to <HI>testify the Gospel of the Grace of God,</HI> according to the Ability which God giveth. And as I tho't Mr.BRIANT'S published Discourse manifestly level'd against some impor|tant Doctrines of the Gospel, and calculated to promote <HI>Error,</HI> to depreciate the sound Principles commonly re|ceived in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> and among <HI>Pro|testants</HI> in general, and to reflect Disgrace on those that profess the same; I have been moved (however unfit for such a Task) to undertake an <HI>Examination</HI> of his Discourse, and to endeavour (after my Measure) the <HI>Defence of the Gospel,</HI> and herewith a Vindication of the many <HI>Expositors</HI> and <HI>Professors</HI> reflected upon by him with so much Severi|ty and Acrimony.</P>
<P>If in the Course of my Remarks it should happen, that I have taken Things any where <HI>otherwise</HI> than he intended, it is what I am not sensible of at present. If he should make such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">an Objection, all I can now say to it, is, That to prevent Misunderstanding he should have forborn all ambiguous Expressions, and ought to have explained his Meaning better. I have taken Things as they stand in his Book, and am not at all conscious of wilfully pervert|ing his Sense.&mdash;If he is able to offer me better <HI>Light</HI> from <HI>Scripture,</HI> on any Argument before us, I am ready to re|ceive the same. But <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">yr</HI> or <HI>Banter, sophistical Cavils,</HI> or <HI>evasive Replies,</HI> won't be worth my minding: And as for <HI>personal Reflections, Insults,</HI> and <HI>Abuses</HI> so familiar with him, I shall not value them a Rush.&mdash;</P>
<P>I see by his Management of the Dispute with Mr. POR|TER, that when he can't fairly grapple with an Argument, he knows how to shuffle and <HI>evade:</HI> And knows how to
<PB N="12" REF="006902_0013_0F6726B309212498">
<HI>satyrise</HI> and <HI>reflect,</HI> when he can no longer reason in any plausible Manner. And tho' at first he sat out with some spe|cious Pretension of being a <HI>Calvinist;</HI> yet it seems&punc; he has thought fit to drop it: And some think, after all his loud Noise, he has given up the <HI>Text</HI> it self, which he pretended to vindicate.&mdash;But perhaps I go t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o far, in touching on that Contro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ersy. Yet I had tho't it not improper for me to make some Remonstrances here against the many abu|sive Reflections, of a <HI>personal</HI> Aspect, which he has filled his published <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tters</HI> with. However, because I would not unreasonably swell this Preface, and because the wor|thy Gentlemen against whom he writes, are well able, if they think it worth while, to defend themselves, I for|bear.&mdash;Only I can't help taking Notice of a Paragraph in his <HI>second Letter,</HI> where he deals in Scandal at a strange Rate; not only aspersing the Character of the Living, but even throwing Dirt upon the Memory of the <HI>Dead.</HI> I think it truly a <HI>Master-Piece</HI> of De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">amation, as black &amp; deformed as almost ever I met with: And this, it seems, in Retaliation for a comparatively soft Reflection; which, however, had perhaps better have been omitted.&mdash;<HI>Perit judicium, cum Res transit in A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">fectum.</HI>&mdash;But I dismiss the disagreable Subject; hoping, this Author, upon a calm Review of Things, will take Shame to himself for so unaccountable a Sally of vindictive Passion.</P>
<P>I shall only further observe, that what seems to have especially <HI>provoked</HI> him against his Opponents, is their be|ing instrumental to bring him under the Repute of an <HI>Ar|minian</HI> or <HI>worse,</HI> to the Publick. And all I shall say to this, is, That had not his <HI>printed Discourse</HI> previously laid him under such a Character, the Rev. Gentlemen he so loudly complains of, would (I confess) have acted an un|kind Part towards him: But as the Case really stood, I think his Offence groundless, and his Heat on this Occa|sion altogether unjustifiable. For he is <HI>himself</HI> the true (ex|emplifying) <HI>Author</HI> of this his Character, by his said <HI>Dis|course;</HI> as he has therein disavow'd the orthodox <HI>commonly received Notions,</HI> on the Head of the Divine <HI>Decrees,</HI> of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">Grace,</HI> of <HI>imputed Righteousness,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="13" REF="006902_0014_0F6726B3C42320B8">
To all which he discovers a strange Antipathy; and at the same Time, makes the <HI>whole Doctrine of Christ</HI> but a more <HI>refined System of Morality,</HI> and resolves the whole Duty of Man into the Practice of <HI>moral Vertue;</HI> declaring this to be the <HI>Basis</HI> and <HI>whole Superstructure</HI> of the Religion of JESUS, the very <HI>Sum</HI> and <HI>Substance</HI> of Christianity; af|firming, that <HI>Revelation</HI> every where suspends our <HI>whole Happiness</HI> on our <HI>personal good Behaviour,</HI> and constitutes this the <HI>Condition of all God's Favours;</HI> yea, that the <HI>grand Design</HI> of Christ's coming into the World was to be a <HI>Preacher of Righteousness,</HI> to <HI>set up the Christian Scheme,</HI> and <HI>propagate Truth and Vertue among Mankind;</HI> that to pro|mote moral Righteousness is the <HI>ultimate View</HI> of GOD in all his Dispensations; that moral Vertue is the <HI>supreme Dignity of</HI> GOD <HI>himself,</HI> the <HI>chief</HI> (if not only) Subject of proper <HI>Gospel-Preaching,</HI> &amp;c. And in short, that by the <HI>com|monly received</HI> Principles, so inconsistent with his, the Chris|tian Religion is in many Places turned into an <HI>idle Specu|lation,</HI> a <HI>mysterious Faith,</HI> a <HI>senseless Superstition,</HI>&amp; a <HI>ground|less Recumbency.</HI>&mdash;This is a true <HI>Breviate</HI> of his Discourse; and if his other Discourses from the Pulpit are analogous to this, or consistent with it, What other Denomination can such a Preacher expect to come under, among sober and judicious Christians, but that of an <HI>Arminian</HI> or <HI>worse?</HI> Certainly then he had no just Reason to reflect, as he has done, on Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> or his <HI>Attestators.</HI> These Rev. Gen|tlemen's Testimony in that Case I think truly worthy of Imitation, as well as Commendation, by the faithful Mi|nisters of CHRIST thro' the Land, and all others who have at Heart Soundness of Doctrine and Purity of Religion: Especially as these <HI>Churches</HI> appear now, more than ever, in Danger of being corrupted by <HI>Arminian</HI> Errors, or <HI>worse,</HI> so industriously propagated by several, with the Author we have in View, lately introduced into the Pastoral Charge. One flagrant Instance I can't help taking a particular No|tice of; I mean, Mr. <HI>John Bass,</HI> who was not many Years ago settled in the Ministry, but has lately been dismiss'd, as hav|ing turned from <HI>Calvinism,</HI>&amp;embraced the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme, by his own Account in his <HI>Narrative</HI> of the Affair. And I can|not

help wishing, that every one of our <HI>Churches,</HI> which have been imposed upon by like Pretenders to Orthodoxy, would follow the laudable Example of the People of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ford;</HI> &amp; re|gularly labour to get free from the dangerous Contagion of a corrupt Ministry, such as disseminates <HI>Arminian</HI> Errors, and loose Opinions in Religion, that tend to subvert the Truth, and destroy vital Christianity among us. Nor can I forbear ex|pressing my Wishes, that in the <HI>Choice</HI> and the <HI>Ordination</HI> of Ministers for the future, <HI>more Care</HI> might be taken, by all concerned therein, to have sufficient Evidence of their being <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound in the Faith,</HI> and hopefully such as will bring the <HI>ever|lasting Gospel</HI> to their People; and not such as under Pre|tence of doing that, will only or mainly preach up <HI>moral Vertue,</HI> and this in such a Way as tends to <HI>destroy the Faith</HI> and vacate <HI>the Gospel of Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>I hope, what I have here offered to the Publick may by the Blessing of God serve some valuable Ends; if not to convince &amp; reduce such as are already engaged in the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme, yet to warn others of the Error and Danger of it, and to establish them in the Belief of the <HI>Truth, as it is in Jesus.</HI> I send forth this Essay with my hearty Prayers to the God of all Grace, that for Christ's sake he would own and bless what is here said agreable to his Mind and Will, for those happy Purposes: And that the Lord in Mercy would help his Ministers, like <HI>Paul,</HI> to <HI>fight the good Fight,</HI> and <HI>keep the Faith;</HI> and help his Churches in this Land, even unto the latest Generations, to <HI>hold fast the Form of sound Words, in Faith and Love, which is in Christ Jesus,</HI> to <HI>keep his Word and not deny his Name,</HI> but to <HI>hold fast that which they have, that no Man take their Crown from them.</HI></P>
<P>And may I, who having obtained Help of God, do continue unto this Day (being in the 78th Year of my Age) <HI>obtain Mercy to be faithful</HI> even unto the Death, and then <HI>finish my Course with Joy,</HI>&mdash;and with the more Joy from a Prospect of this People's <HI>walking in the Truth</HI> and <HI>continuing in the Grace of God.</HI></P>
<P>Now unto him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, be <HI>Glory in the Church</HI> by CHRIST JESUS, throughout all Ages, World without End. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>A VINDICATION Of divers important Gospel-Doctrines, with the Preachers and Professors of them; Essayed in the Way of Remarks upon a Discourse (delivered Sermon-wise, and published, on ISAIAH 64. 6.) Intitled, The Absurdity and Blasphemy of depreciating moral Vertue.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a memorable Observation, which some of our venerable Fathers in <HI>New-England</HI> once made by Way of Lamentation, very applicable to the present Day; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <Q>It was one of the Songs (as the <HI>Jewish</HI> Masters tell us) in the Feast of Tabernacles&punc;&mdash;<HI>Blessed be our Youth, which have not made our old Men ashamed.</HI> But alas! we that are <HI>old</HI> Men, must confess ourselves <HI>ashamed,</HI> when we see how our <HI>Youth</HI> have expressed and behaved themselves; and with what Scoffs they have assaulted the Order of the Gospe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in some Things lately published &amp; scattered about the Country.</Q> Now if in their Day <HI>Scoffers</HI> being found assaulting the <HI>Order of the Gospel</HI> was to them Matter of Lamentation, how much more lamentable is it, that there are to be found in our Day <HI>Scoffers</HI> among our <HI>Youths,</HI> scoffing at and assault|ing even the <HI>Doctrines of the Gospel,</HI> and some of the most

important Points of Gospel-Truths, treating them with Ridicule, in Discourses printed and scattered about the Country! I am sorry to say it, I think we have a flagrant Instance in the Discourse (not to say <HI>Sermon</HI>) now to come under our Examination: Where it is very obvious, sun|dry great Doctrines of the Gospel are exploded and hissed at, the Characters of eminent Men, who have espoused them, are aspersed and contemptuously treated, and as I apprehend, some dangerous Errors asserted, in such a con|fident Manner, as if we were to be insulted or flouted out of our religious Principles;&mdash;as if truly these Churches in <HI>New-England</HI> had from the Beginning been settled on a wrong Bottom (so have their Religion still to seek) and as if this our <HI>Author</HI> must be the very Man to open our Eyes and illuminate the Country! Indeed if this Gen|tleman, or any others, were capable of giving us <HI>better Light</HI> into divine T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ths upon Scripture-Authority, I hope none of us would appear so prejudiced in Favour of our own private Sentiments, or of the commonly receiv|ed Opinions in Religion, as to shut our Eyes against it, or wilfully reject it: But I must freely say, I have little Expectation of <HI>that,</HI> from One whose first Attempt seems calculated to <HI>darken Counsel by Words without</HI> true <HI>Know|ledge,</HI> and scatter Darkness rather tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Light; and tends to obscure, yea even to subvert the Gospel, rather than to establish and explain it; particularly in regard that the main and most essential <HI>End</HI> of Christ's coming into the World, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>to make Expiation for Sin,</HI> and <HI>bring in ever|lasting Righteousness,</HI> is in Effect denied, by an abusive Representation of the grand Design of Christ'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> mediato|rial Undertaking; as will be seen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> its proper Place, in the Course of these Remarks.</P>

<P>In the Prosecution of which Purpose, I shall&mdash;</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="006902_0019_0F6726B76C7B7B50">1. Consider the Words of the <HI>Text,</HI> as they stand con|nected with the <HI>Context;</HI> and likewise compare them with <HI>parallel</HI> Passages of Scripture, both in the old Testament and New.</P>

<P N="3">3. Shew the <HI>Danger</HI> of substituting or setting up a Righteousness of <HI>our own</HI> in the Room or Stead of <HI>Christ's</HI> Righteousness;&mdash;and consider how far our <HI>Author</HI> is doctrinally faulty, on this Head, in his Discourse.</P>
<P N="4">4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> whether there is not more of <HI>Absurdity</HI> and <HI>Blasphemy</HI> couched in disowning some of the main <HI>Ends</HI> of CHRIST'S coming into the World, than can be in the pretended Depreciation of <HI>moral Virtue.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Consider whether the severe <HI>Reflections</HI> on the Reli|gion of <HI>others,</HI> insinuated by this Author (particularly in Pages 7th &amp; 8th of his Discourse) are not very justly ap|plicable to <HI>his own</HI> Religion, as exhibited therein to the World: And also whether the <HI>Objections</HI> raised in the Close of that Discourse, which he has framed and pre|tended to answer, do not appear a <HI>true</HI> and <HI>ample Descrip|tion</HI> of the whole of his Performance, notwithstanding all his laboured Solutions.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to consider the Words of his <HI>Text,</HI> particularly as they lie in Connection with the <HI>Context;</HI>&mdash;and to com|pare them with some <HI>parallel</HI> Passages in Scripture.</P>

<P N="1"> (1.) I shall consider the <HI>Words themselves,</HI> and view them in their Relation to the <HI>Context;</HI> withal taking some Notice of what our Author has advanced in the Discourse before us.</P>

<PB N="5" REF="006902_0020_0F6726B82E51AE68">
(on several Passages of which I shall take Occasion to make some Remarks, as they may properly fall in under one or other of&punc; the Heads propos'd to Consideration) at length comes to his <HI>Text;</HI> which I shall first give you <HI>his</HI> Construction of in his own Words, with some Re|marks upon it; and then offer <HI>my</HI> Sentiments upon it, back'd with some Arguments, both from Reason and Revelation.</P>
<P>Our Author having made a long Harangue upon Pre|mises something foreign to the Purpose, at last recollects himself, and returns after a tedious Digression, to his Sub|ject; beginning thus (<HI>Page</HI> 9.) <Q>And [not to forget my Text.]</Q>&mdash;which peradventure he might have done for the whole Hour, and yet carried on his Discourse with near as much Perti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ence, and Propriety, as it now appears with.&mdash;However, let him go on in his own Way.&mdash;</P>
<P>He adds, <Q>No Passage perhaps in the whole Book of God has been more <HI>shamefully perverted,</HI> than this I have now chosen to discourse upon: The Words, as they are <HI>commonly recei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed,</HI> are a standing <HI>Reflection</HI> on all <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>good Manners;</HI> the most effectual <HI>Dis|couragement</HI> that could be gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en to the Practice of Christian <HI>Morality,</HI> and consequently one of the most <HI>fatal Snares</HI> that could be laid for the Souls of Men.</Q></P>
<P>A wonderful Flight!&mdash;On which I observe, our Author's Design (it seems) being to enlighten the Christian World, and to correct and reform our vulgar Expositors &amp; Prea|chers, might judge artfully enough, in beginning his At|tempt thus, with such <HI>swelling Words of Vanity,</HI> and of <HI>Re|proach</HI> upon "the Words of his Text as they <HI>are com|monly received.</HI>"&mdash;And surely, if the Case be as he represents it, it can't be a <HI>venial</HI> Crime in any, after such fair Warn|ing from our Author, to presume ever again to apply the Words as they are "<HI>commonly received.</HI>"</P>
<P>Now he tells us,&mdash;<Q>The <HI>common Notion</HI> of them is, that the Prophet is here giving a just and literal De|scription of the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the <HI>Best;</HI> while he is only confessing and lamenting the aggravated <HI>Sins of
<PB N="6" REF="006902_0021_0F6726B8E5682048">
the worst</HI> of Men.</Q>&mdash;This his Representation of the Case seems exceptionable enough in both its Parts, as to the Manner of Expression at least: however, I shall not stand to criticize upon Language, or be nice about Words. He further amplifies in stating the <HI>Notion commonly re|ceived:</HI> But miserably misses it, when he says, <Q><HI>The best Righteousness has been generally spoken of, as no better a Qualification,</HI>&mdash;than <HI>filtby Rags.</HI></Q>&mdash;As I shall have Occasion to shew afterwards.</P>
<P>He comes at last (<HI>P.</HI> 10.) to give us <HI>his</HI> Judgment concerning the genuine meaning of the <HI>Text;</HI>&mdash;And with the highest Assurance tells us how it is to be understood; designing, it seems, to prevent Expositors and others, for the future, from so "shamefully perverting" this Passage of Scripture&punc; and that <HI>the Words, as they are commonly received,"</HI> may no longer be "<HI>a standing Reflection on all Virtue and good Manners,</HI>" or "<HI>such a fatal Snare to the Souls of Men.</HI>"&mdash;Thus he declares himself&mdash;<Q>The true Sense of the Words (as I trust will appear in the Pro|gress of this Discourse) is not, that their <HI>Righteousness</HI> would have been as <HI>filthy Rags,</HI> if they had really been a righteous People (the sacred Writer suggests no such thing)&mdash;It must therefore be a Matter of great Importance, a Design richly worth our Undertaking, to deliver the <HI>Text from this false Gloss, this horrid Abuse that has been put upon it.</HI></Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>But I doubt, our Author has sadly missed his Aim,&mdash;and instead of <HI>delivering his Text from a false Gloss, and horrid Abuse,</HI> has indeed rather put one upon it himself: as, I am perswaded, will appear in the Sequel of these Remarks.&mdash;Whereas this Gentleman has taken Pains to blacken the Character of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and set it in the most odious Light; I think this injuriously done, and but very little to the Purpose.&mdash;That the Jewish Nation, at the Time of <HI>Isaiah's</HI> Prophecy, had too generally fallen into a State of wosul Degeneracy, I con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ess, is sufficiently evident from Scripture: But that they were so universally <HI>ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ned</HI> to such a Degree of <HI>Immorality and Wickedness,</HI>

as they are represented by our Author, I believe wants Proof; and so does his Assertion, that <Q>if they had <HI>really</HI> been a <HI>righteous People, their Righteousness would not have been as filthy Rags,</HI>&mdash;and that the <HI>sacred Writer suggests no such Thing.</HI></Q> With as much of an Air of Infallibility as this Gentleman here delivers his Opinion, it may possibly before we have done with him, appear, he is under a very gross Mistake; and the Charge of put|ing a "<HI>false Gloss and horrid Abuse on the Text,</HI>" returns on his own Head</P>
<P>The Decision of this Case is of great, and (as it ap|pears to me) of the last Importance. In order therefore to discover, on which Side of the Question the Truth lies, I shall proceed, as was proposed, to offer some Tho'ts on the <HI>Text,</HI> and shall soberly deliver my Opinion in the Case, submitting the same to the Correction of Men of better Judgment, than either our Author or I, inModesty can pretend to.</P>
<P>Now that we may come to a clear understanding of the Words of the Text,&mdash;<HI>All our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags,</HI>&mdash;It may be of use to premise the following Considerations:&mdash;Namely,</P>
<P N="1">1. That GOD always had, and ever will have a <HI>Church</HI> in the World; it were easy to prove this: but I suppose it will not be disputed; therefore I need not labour the Point.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the <HI>Church of God,</HI> under all it's Vicissitudes and Revolutions, in the several Periods of Time, whether under the Patriarchal, or Mosaical, or Christian Constitu|on, hath always had in it a Number of <HI>true Believers</HI> in God and in the Messiah.&mdash;Even in the darkest and most degenerate Age, there always has been a <HI>Remnant accord|ing to the Election of Grace,</HI> who were <HI>Fellow-Citizens with the Saints and of the Houshold of God;</HI> tho' sometimes it has been but a <HI>small Remnant,</HI> and like the <HI>Grape-gleanings of the Vintage,</HI> as it were <HI>one of a City and two of a Tribe:</HI> Nevertheless, God, who despises not the Day of small Things, has still owned them for his People, and not for|saken

<P N="3">3. That under the Church's legal and typical Admi|nistration, God put his <HI>Prophets,</HI> in the Times of their Prophe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ying, into a <HI>double Capacity</HI> and <HI>Trust,</HI> wherein they were eminent <HI>Types</HI> of the great <HI>Mediator</HI> between God and Men, the Man Christ Jesus, who both mediates with God for his People, and with his People for God. Thus were the Prophets appointed to be God's Mouth to his People, Jer. 15. 19. <HI>Thou shalt be my Mouth:</HI> and as such they came to the People in the Name of God, under his Authority, and under a like Promise as that made to <HI>Moses,</HI> Exod. 4. 12. <HI>Go, and I will be with thy Mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.</HI>&mdash;They were also the People's Mouth unto God, in a Manner as <HI>Aaron</HI> was Spokes-man to <HI>Moses,</HI> ibid. <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 16.&mdash;Now under this pub|lick Character we are to consider the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> ma|king the Confession in the Text, <HI>All our Righteousnesses

Their Petition is urged and enforced by a variety of Pleas, par|ticularly from the Consideration of what God had already done for his People; and they proceed, in the lively Act|ings of Faith, to express their Acquiescence in God's Pro|mises, not only with Regard to what temporal Good he might in Mercy bestow upon them, but also to the in|conceivable Glory he had in Store, <HI>prepared for them that wait for him,</HI> (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 4th of the Context) or as the Apostle expounds it, <HI>prepared for them that love him.</HI> (1 Cor. 29)&mdash;Then the Church goes on (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 5.) to a farther Expression of her Faith, with Regard to the Constancy of God's Mercy&mdash;<HI>Thou meet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">st,</HI> or as it may be read, Thou ownest and acceptest, <HI>him that rejoyceth and worketh Righteousness,</HI> i. e. the same as before described, such as <HI>wait for God,</HI> or <HI>love him;</HI> who delight themselves in the Lord, and delight in keeping his Commandments; who rejoyce not in Iniquity, but rejoyce in the Truth, and rejoyce in Hope, while through Faith they are enabled to work Righteousness; who experiencing the Joy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Faith, have Confidence toward God,&mdash;<HI>that they shall be saved;</HI> as the Church speaks in the Close of this 5th Verse.

And I would add, that the purest Church that ever was upon Earth, ought and might with the greatest Propriety, even in her purest Times, since <HI>Adam</HI>'s <HI>Fall,</HI> as an indispensable Duty, confess with Lamentation in the Language of the Church here, <HI>We are all as an un|clean Thing.</HI>&mdash;Now if the Fountain be <HI>unclean,</HI> no Won|der if the Streams are so too.

<P>This may suffice for the Illustration of the Text. I would now proceed something further, in viewing the <HI>Context.</HI>&mdash;That it was the <HI>Church,</HI> and the only one that God had in the World at that Day, which made the hum|ble Confession, we have been considering, may be demon|strated from the repeated Expressions of their <HI>Faith</HI> in God; not only in Passages preceeding the Text, but in several that follow it, <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 8 &amp; 9. <HI>But now, O Lord, thou art our Father: we are the Clay, and thou our Potter, and we are all the Work of thy Hand.&mdash;Behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy People.</HI>&mdash;The Prophet here appears plainly addressing the Throne of Grace with a <HI>Prayer of Faith,</HI> in the Name and Behalf of the <HI>Church</HI> of God: Nor can it be suppos'd in Reason, but that there was a Remnant of <HI>faithful</HI> ones at that Day, if we consider that memorable Instance in the Time of <HI>Elijah,</HI> the Prophet, when the Ten Tribes had revolted to such a Degree, that <HI>he made Intercession to God against Israel,</HI> and complained as if he were <HI>left alone,</HI> in the true Worship and Fear of God: But what said the Answer of God unto him? <HI>I have reserved to my self sevenThousand Men, who have not bowed the Knee to Baal.</HI> (Compare 1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 19.&amp; <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.) Now if there was such a <HI>Remnant</HI> according to the Election of Grace, in that Day of extream Degeneracy in <HI>Israel,</HI> when they had <HI>forsaken God's Covenant, thrown down his Altars, and killed his Prophets,</HI> insomuch that <HI>Elijah</HI> tho't he was the <HI>only</HI> Man left to serve God; we may reaso|nably conclude then, That in the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> who had never been so wholly given to Idolatry, but had the Worship of God always in some Degree kept up a|mong them, there was at least a proportionable Number of sincere Worshippers of God still remaining in this Tribe, and in <HI>Isaiah's</HI> Time many such among this Peo|ple; tho' represented by our Author, as an <HI>abandoned</HI>

People, the "<HI>worst</HI> of Men; <HI>wholly</HI> given up to the most detestable Wickedness."&mdash;But that this is an abusive and injurious Representation, besides what has been already said, I might argue from the <HI>Date</HI> of <HI>Isaiah'</HI>s Prophecy; the latter Part of which (including the disputed Text) being in the Reign of <HI>Hezekiah</HI> King of <HI>Judah,</HI> a pious Prince and a great Reformer; when the <HI>good Knowledge of the Lord</HI> spread greatly in the Land, and God very sig|nally <HI>revived his Work,</HI> insomuch that divers even of the other Tribes, not included within <HI>Hezekiah's</HI> Dominions, we are told, <HI>humbled themselves,</HI> and came to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to keep the <HI>Passover,</HI> and to <HI>see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Lord God of their Fa|thers; also in</HI> Judah <HI>the Hand of God was to give them one Heart to do the Commandment of the King, and of the Princes by the Word of the Lord.</HI> (2 Chron. 30. 11, 12.)&mdash;And tho' in this good King's Reign, <HI>Isaiah</HI> prophesied of the <HI>Babylonian</HI> Captivity, yet we read, <HI>Then</HI> Hezekiah <HI>said to</HI> Isaiah, <HI>Good is the Word of the Lord which thou hast spoken: He said moreover, For there shall be Peace and Truth in my Days.</HI> (Isaiah 39. 8.)&mdash;And the Prophet's next Message, in the following Chapter, begins with Words of Conso|lation, <HI>Comfort ye, Comfort ye my People, saith the Lord, speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I have insisted the longer on these Things, to shew, That our Author's Discourse was laid on a wrong Foun|dation; and, I think, has neither Scripture nor Reason to support the Representation therein made of the <HI>Jews,</HI> as a wholly abandoned People, at the Time when <HI>Isaiah</HI> made that Confession in the Text, <HI>All our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags:</HI> as also by Consequence to shew, this Character, odious as it is, is justly applicable to the <HI>Righ|teousnesses</HI> of the very <HI>best</HI> of Men, in the Respects which have been mentioned; since, in some such Respects, even the holy <HI>Prophet,</HI> and godly <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> and others of the <HI>Faithful,</HI> in whose Name he spake, did apply this Character to <HI>their own</HI> Righteousnesses. Upon the whole, I would add,&mdash;Was not the Confession in the Text dictated by the <HI>holy Spirit,</HI> and put into the Prophet's Mouth, by di|vine

Would to God, there were found among us, even among us, many more, than its to be feared there are, spirited humbly to make this Confession in the Text; and like the Church on this Oc|casion, drawn off from Dependance on their <HI>moral Vertues;</HI> and brought to place their whole Confidence in <HI>Christ's Righteousness:</HI> yet, while renouncing their own Righte|ousness in the Affair of Justification, not at all abating of their <HI>Care to maintain good Works,</HI> but still <HI>diligently fol|lowing every good Work,</HI> strictly and constantly attending every Duty, whether religious or civil, personal or rela|tive!</P>
<P N="2"> (2.) I proceed now to the other Thing proposed under my first general Head of Remarks, which is to produce some <HI>parallel</HI> Texts of Scripture, and compare them with this Passage in the Prophet.&mdash;There are similar Passages enough, both in the Old and New-Testament, to prove, that the Church's Confession here has in Effect ever been, and gives us Reason to think it still is and ever will be, the Language of the Church of God,&mdash;<HI>All our Righte|ousnesses are as filthy Rags.</HI> And therefore that it's not a Confession peculiarly calculated for that <HI>Age</HI> wherein it was indited; nor to be confined to that People of the <HI>Jews</HI> only, as our Author suggests.

the <HI>Mercy of God;</HI> where we find them confessing <HI>their Unworthiness,</HI> pleading for <HI>Pardon</HI> of Sin, <HI>justifying</HI> Pro|vidence in <HI>afflictive</HI> Dispensations, <HI>magnifying</HI> the divine <HI>Grace</HI> towards them in <HI>favourable</HI> Events, <HI>deprecating</HI> God's entring into a <HI>judicial</HI> Process, &amp;c.&mdash;I shall only mention a few out of the many Instances that might be alledg'd, to my Purpose.&mdash;Thus, when this very Prophet, the Penman of the Text, said as in Isai. 6. 5. <HI>Wo is me, for I am undone, because I am a Man of unclean Lips, and I dwell in the midst of a People of unclean Lips; for mine Eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts:</HI> What does this Confession import, less than that in the controverted Words, <HI>All our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags!</HI>&mdash;And what less than this does that of another Prophet amount to, who while he is personating &amp; pleading for the Church, says, as in Dan. 9. 18. <HI>O my God, incli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e thine Ear,&mdash;for we do not present our Supplications before thee for our Righteousnesses, but for thy great Mercies!</HI> Her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> we see, where the Force of the Church's Argument in the Mouth of the Prophet, lies, when instant in Prayer for divine Relief and Help, in their present Difficulties,&mdash;<HI>Not for our Righte|onsnesses, O our God, but for thy great Mercies, we present our Supplications before thee.</HI> The Sense is plainly this, <Q>Thou art our Covenant-God, and we pray in Faith and Hope for thy Salvation: yet our only Plea at the Throne of Grace is <HI>thy Mercy,</HI> not <HI>our own Worthiness;</HI> for we can challenge nothing at thy Hands on the Account of <HI>our own Righteousnesses,</HI> which are even <HI>as filthy Rags,</HI> in the Sight of thine holy and all-seeing Eyes:&mdash;We therefore renounce all Dependance upon these for ob|taining thy Favour, and rely wholly upon thy Mercy, which is great towards thy People:</Q> <HI>For the Lord's sake,</HI> (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 17.) for <HI>thy Name's</HI> sake which is <HI>in him,</HI> who is the expected Messiah, <HI>The Lord our Righteousness.</HI>&mdash;This Passage in the Prophet <HI>Daniel</HI> is the more to be noticed, as it is so parallel with the disputed Text, in <HI>Isaiah,</HI>&mdash;giving us a full and ample Explication of the Confession, <HI>All our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags:</HI> and what makes
<PB N="18" REF="006902_0033_0F6726C660211CE8">
it the more emphatical, is, that the Phrase, <HI>our Righte|ousnesses</HI> (in the plural Number) is no where else to be found, that I know of, in the whole Bible, but in these two Passages of <HI>Isaiah</HI> and <HI>Daniel;</HI> and these two Pro|phets lived in different Periods of Time, near or quite a Century distant from one another; both used this Ex|pression in Prayer, and on the like Occasion, both plead|ing the Cause and being the Mouth of the Church and People of God: so that we have here the Church speak|ing the same Language in various remote Ages; and alike renouncing <HI>their own Righteousnesses</HI> even as <HI>filthy Rags,</HI> at one Time and another, in the most solemn Man|ner; not presuming to utter a Word in their own Justi|fication, not resting <HI>in the Law,</HI> nor drawing any Argu|ment from their <HI>moral Vertues,</HI> when pleading with God.</P>
<P>In the next Place, Let us take a View of <HI>Job's</HI> Exam|ple, a Man <HI>perfect and upright,</HI> beyond all in his Day, yet how full is he of Language equivalent to the Confession in the Text? Job 9. 2, 3. <HI>How should Man be just with God?</HI> (or before God) <HI>If he will contend with him, he can|not answer him one of a Thousand.</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>.15. <HI>Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make Supplication to my Judge.</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 20. <HI>If I justify my self, my own Mouth shall condemn me.</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 30&mdash;32. <HI>If I wash my self with Snow-Water, and make my Hands never so clean, yet shalt thou plunge me in the Ditch, and mine own Cloaths shall abhor me. For he is not a Man, that I should answer him, and we should come together in Judgment.</HI> So Chap. 10. 15. <HI>If I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my Head.</HI> Chap. 13. 23. <HI>How many are mine Iniquities &amp; Sins? Make me to know my Transgression and my Sins.</HI> Chap. 14. 4. <HI>Who can bring a clean Thing out of an unclean? not one.</HI>&mdash;Tho' <HI>Job</HI> in his Conferences often pleads his Integrity, in Opposition to the Censures of his uncharitable Friends; yet in his Addresses to God, his usual Manner was to hum|ble himself thus, and renounce all Confidence in <HI>his own Righteousness.</HI> And tho' sometimes in an Hour of Temp|tation, the good Man fell into some Expressions too im|patient

patient and arrogant, and discovering the Remains of a <HI>Self-righteous</HI> Spirit in him; yet when recovered out of those ill Frames, and brought to himself, he returns to his Self-judging and Self-humbling Language. Chap 40. 3, 4, 5. <HI>Then</HI> Job <HI>answered the Lord, and said, Behold I am vile! what shall I answer thee? I will lay my Hand up|on my Mouth; once have I spoken, but I will not answer: yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.</HI> He here retracts (makes his Recantation) and calls back the querulous and vain glorious Expressions, that had dropt from him, when he spake unadvisedly with his Lips, by way of faulting of God, and exalting himself, and setting forth <HI>his own Righ|teousness.</HI>&mdash;God's Reply to him shews, that this Kind of Language was what <HI>Job</HI> had his Eye to. <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 7, 8. <HI>Gird up thy Loins now like a Man: I will demand of thee; and declare thou unto me. Wilt thou also disannul my Judgment? Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayst be righteous?</HI>&mdash;And upon the whole, we find <HI>Job</HI> most intirely submitting to the <HI>Righteousness of God,</HI> and no longer daring to use any such Expression as might look as if he were <HI>going about to establish has own Righteousness.</HI> When <HI>Job</HI> answered the Lord, he concluded with saying, <HI>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the Ear, but now mine Eye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eeth thee; where|fore I abhor my self, and repent in Dust and Ashes.</HI>&mdash;What can this mean less than confessing that <HI>all his Righteousness was as filthy Rags?</HI></P>
<P>So <HI>Job's</HI> Friends, tho' they did not always speak the Thing that is <HI>right,</HI> yet are judged to have been good Men, and in their Speeches discover much of a humble Spirit towards God, even while passing mistaken Cen|sures upon <HI>Job.</HI> Thus <HI>Eliphaz</HI> speaks, Chap. 15. 14,&mdash;16. <HI>What is Man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a Woman, that he should be righteous? Behold, he putteth no Trust in his Saints; yea, the Heavens are not clean in his Sight: How much more abominable and filthy is Man, which drinketh Iniquity like Water!</HI> So <HI>Bildad</HI> says, Chap. 25, 4. <HI>How then can Man be justified with God? or how can he be clean, that is born of a Woman: Behold even to the Moon,

and it shineth not; yea, the Stars are not pure in his Sight: How much less Man, that is a Worm; and the Son of Man, that is a Worm!</HI> (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 5,6.)&mdash;What is this, in true Con|struction, but pronouncing <HI>all our Righteousnesses to be as filthy Rags!</HI></P>
<P>What short of this do <HI>Abraham's</HI> Words import? Gen. 18. 27. <HI>Behold now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but Dust and Ashes!&mdash;Dust</HI> by Nature, and <HI>Ashes</HI> by Corruption (as some have glossed on the Place) such was the humble Sense that <HI>Abraham</HI> had of himself, and of his own <HI>Righteousness:</HI> but if <HI>Abraham</HI> were justified by Works, he had whereof to glory.&mdash;So <HI>Jacob,</HI> tho' he could plead <HI>his Righteousness,</HI> as answering for him, respecting his Dealings with <HI>Laban,</HI> yet when he has to do with GOD, he confesses himself <HI>less than the least of all his Mercies.</HI> (Gen. 32. 10.) And how then must <HI>his own Righteousness</HI> appear in his Eyes? Even <HI>as filthy Rags.</HI>&mdash;In like manner <HI>David,</HI> the Man after God's own Heart, tho' he could appeal to the supream Judge, in the Controversy between him and his Adversaries, and rely on God's Faithfulness to answer him in that Case, yet he saw at the same Time such Failures staining <HI>all his Righteousness</HI> in the Eyes of a Heart-searching God, and consequently such Grounds of God's entering into an angry Controversy with him, in which he could never stand, that he earnestly deprecates it. Psal. 143. 2. <HI>Enter not into Judgment with thy Servant; for in thy Sight shall no Man living be justified.</HI> And again, Psal. 130. 3. <HI>If thou, Lord, shouldst mark Iniquity, O Lord, who shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> stand!</HI> The Reason of this is suggested by <HI>Solomon</HI> in his Prayer, 2 Chron. 6. 36. <HI>For there is no Man which sinneth not.</HI> Which Consideration was doubtless one Motive to his using that Expression (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 18.) <HI>But will God in very Deed dwell with Men on the Earth!</HI> Even good Men, <HI>the Saints in the Earth,</HI> tho' <HI>excellent</HI> comparatively with others, yet by Reason of <HI>Sin,</HI> that dwelleth in them, that often breaketh out, and taints <HI>all their Righteousnesses,</HI> have just Occasion to be astonished at God's Condescension in <HI>dwelling with

What then must be his Apprehensions of <HI>his own Righteousness?</HI>&mdash;And may we not well think the same View of himself was the Reason of <HI>Moses'</HI>s Conduct, when God appeared to him in the burning Bush, of which we read, <HI>Exod.</HI> 3. 6. <HI>And</HI> Moses <HI>hid his Face; for he was afraid to look upon God.</HI> The practical Language of this is like that of <HI>Job,</HI> Behold I am <HI>vile;</HI> and that of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> Wo is me, for <HI>I am undone.</HI> He doubtless conceived of himself appearing in a <HI>dirty Hue</HI> (morally speaking) and utterly unworthy to approach the Presence of a holy God. He looked, in his own Apprehension, like one in <HI>filthy Rags;</HI> even like the high Priest we read of, Ze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h. 3. 3. <HI>Now</HI> Joshua <HI>was cloathed with filthy Garment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and stood before the An|gel.</HI> This Case was indeed <HI>typical,</HI> and <HI>Joshua'</HI>s filthy Garments may be considered as emblematical of the for|did Figure or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">arance, that the <HI>Saints</HI> themselves and their <HI>Righteousnesses,</HI> if viewed in the Glass of the Law,

must make before a holy God. <HI>Joshua'</HI>s having his filthy Garments taken away, and Change of Raiment given him, typically represents the Need there is of our having the <HI>filthy Rags</HI> of our <HI>own Righteousness</HI> put away from before the Eye of vindictive Justice; and shews us, that we can appear with Safety before a holy God, only as cloath|ed with <HI>Change of Raiment,</HI> the Garment <HI>given</HI> us, even <HI>the Righteousness which is of Faith.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed our Author (<HI>Page</HI> 16.) pretends, that <HI>the</HI> per|sonal <HI>Righteousness of the Saints</HI> is the <HI>fine Linnen, cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">n and white,</HI> spoken of by <HI>John,</HI> Rev. 19. 8. Now, tho' this were granted, yet if we consult the Context, it seems as if it were the Righteousness of Saints in their <HI>glorify'd</HI> State, who indeed <HI>walk with God in white,</HI> that is represented under this Similitude: and if the perfect <HI>Righteousness of the Saints in Light</HI> be repre|sented as such a <HI>Robe of Glory,</HI> this doth not infer, that the <HI>imperfect</HI> Righteousness of Saints <HI>in the Earth,</HI> ought to have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Resemblance applied to it. This surely will not bear the Comparison: For the best Garment of personal Righteousness on Earth need <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be <HI>washed,</HI> and can only be <HI>made white in the Blood of the Lamb.</HI>&mdash;Without being washed with the Blood of Christ, and as considered in themselves, compared to the Law to which they should be conformable, <HI>all our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags.</HI>&mdash;But the Righteousness of CHRIST is a <HI>spot|less Robe:</HI> And this has generally been thought to be the <HI>white Raiment</HI> (spoken of <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 18.) which our Saviour <HI>counsels us to buy of him.</HI> The only Cloathing sufficient to <HI>hide the Shame of our Nakedness,</HI> to hide the <HI>Nakedness</HI> of our <HI>moral Vertues,</HI> as well as to cover our Sins, is that <HI>best Robe,</HI> the Robe of Christ's Righteousness, which is upon all them that believe.&mdash;Agreable to this, the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> tells us, <HI>he counted all Things but Loss and Dung, that he might win Christ, and be found in him, not having his own Righteousness which is of the Law, but that which is through Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith,</HI> Phil. 3. 8,9.&mdash;This is the <HI>fine Linn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n, clean

<P>To conclude this Head, we may observe, the Apostle having given us a Catalogue of many primit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e Saints, tells us,&mdash;<HI>These all died in Faith,</HI> Heb. 11. 13.&mdash;even as he had before remarked, Chap. 10. 38. <HI>The Just shall live by Faith,</HI>&mdash;in the Prophet's Words. Now it is of the very Nature of <HI>Faith</HI> to exclude <HI>boasting,</HI> and to renounce all Confidence <HI>in our own Righteousness.</HI>&mdash;Surely whether living or dying, we should make it our Concern, that we may be strong in <HI>Faith,</HI> giving Glory to God: yet it must be notic'd, where there is <HI>Faith un|feigned,</HI> this always <HI>purifieth the Heart,</HI> and influenceth to follow universal <HI>Holiness;</HI> and besure will not permit us to neglect the Duties of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rality,</HI> or slight any of the social Vertues; for <HI>Faith worketh by Love,</HI> both towards God, and towards our Neighbour.&mdash;There is the <HI>Obedience</HI> of Faith, as well as the <HI>Dependance</HI> of Faith; and both are exemplified in the sound Believer.&mdash;Upon the whole, I must say, we under the Gospel have as little Foundation for <HI>boasting</HI> in our moral Attainments, as had the <HI>Jewish</HI>

Church in the Days of the Prophets; and therefore should <HI>not be high-minded, but fear,</HI> tho' the God of all Grace has <HI>provided some better Things for us,</HI> than he did of old for them; <HI>fear,</HI> I say, left our superiour and singular Advan|tages should only serve to aggravate our Sins, in the Sight of that God, <HI>who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity,</HI> tho' it were but <HI>the Iniquity of our holy Things,</HI> without Detestation, in whomsoever it be found.

<P>It was proposed in the next Place,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>To attempt the Removal of those</HI> Prejudices, <HI>our Au|thor has taken Pains to raise against many sound &amp; orthodox</HI> Protestant Expositors <HI>and others, by his harsh &amp; unjust Reflections, of a</HI> personal <HI>Aspect, and by his unfair Repre|sentations of their</HI> Principles; some of which I shall men|tion, and endeavour a Vindication of.</P>
<P>In the Introduction to his Discourse, and elsewhere, this Gentleman exhibits very loud and bitter Complaints a|gainst certain <HI>Expositors,</HI> and others that join with them,
<PB N="25" REF="006902_0040_0F6726CD2A436988">
as having <HI>wretchedly perverted &amp; horribly abused his</HI> Text, <HI>All our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags;</HI> and as having advanced many Opinions in Religion, which he insinuates to be of a very bad Nature and dangerous Tendency.</P>
<P>Now in order to make the fairest and fullest Answer to these Complaints, I shall take this Method. (1.) Consider <HI>who</HI> are the Expositors and others here intended by the Author.&mdash;(2.) Repeat in his own Words some of the ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|cent and severe <HI>Reflections</HI> he has cast upon them, and hint at some of his <HI>Misrepresentations</HI> of their Opinions.&mdash;And (3.) Defend their Memory and Character against the <HI>In|justice</HI> done them; and withal attempt a brief Vindica|tion of their <HI>Principles,</HI> as it comes in my Way in the Course of these Remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1. We are to consider who the <HI>Expositors</HI> and <HI>others</HI> are, that the Author had a View to in his Complaints and Censures.&mdash;Now this, I think, will sufficiently appear by the Description he has in Effect given of them, in remon|strating against many of their known Tenets, as well as their Opinion upon his Text. Tho' he has not, in several Instances, fairly stated those Doctrines of theirs, which he excepts against, but has represented them in Language designed, as it seems, to excite a Prejudice both against them and the Patrons and Abettors of them, in his less judicious and more unwary Readers: yet upon the whole, I think, he has left himself no Room for Evasion here, by pretending as tho' he had really no View to such Exposi|tors and their Adherents; for it is apparent, that our Au|thor's Eye was to such as held the Doctrines of <HI>personal Election, particular Redemption, original Sin, efficacious Grace, imputed Righteousness, Justification by Faith,</HI> the <HI>Saints final Perseverance,</HI>&mdash;and in a Word, <HI>God's Sovereignty in Man's</HI> Salvation.&mdash;All these Doctrines seem very plainly struck at, either directly or by Consequence, in his Discourse, and some of them treated with supercilious Disdain &amp; Contempt.&mdash;In the general, he explodes them under the opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">brious Name of "<HI>Libertine</HI> Notions." <HI>P.</HI> 9, and he observes, that for the propagating them, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> these
<PB N="26" REF="006902_0041_0F6726CDE6631278">
Notions, <Q>No Passage perhaps in the Book of God has been more <HI>shamefully perverted,</HI> than this which he has chosen to discourse upon: The Words (says he) as they are commonly received, are a standing Refl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ction on all Virtue.</Q> Hence we may with the highest Reason con|clude, our Author's Invectives are levelled against Protestant Expositors, and those in special of a Calvinistical Character and Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wasion, and those that adhere to the like <HI>Princi|ples,</HI> which the Ministers in <HI>New-England</HI> generally have done, and with plain scriptural Gospel <HI>Warrant.</HI>&mdash;It is therefore strange and very <HI>lamentable,</HI> that any should be found among us in these Churches and in the Ministry too, venting such Indignation and Scorn at a <HI>Notion</HI> of his Text (by his own Confession) commonly received; yea, denying, and even deriding, and bantering those great and important Scripture-Doctrines, which it has been made use of to support, (with many other <HI>parallel Texts,</HI> above cited to, under the foregoing Head) which were so dear to our pious Predecessors, and which have hitherto been so commonly received in the whole Protestant World; as appears particularly by the publick <HI>Confessions of Faith, and Catechisms,</HI> as well as other Writings they have left us as Memorials of their Belief, and for Helps to us to un|derstand the Scriptures, and that our Faith may be fixed in the Doctrines contained in them. I think it no Trespass upon the Rules of Charity, to suppose our Author had some Reference to these, as they are commonly read and valued among us; and I look on the Assembly's Cate|chism in particular, as struck at in his Discourse, (and no Wonder, when he palpably denies it in some of its essen|tial Points, and declares (by credible Information) against instructing his own, or other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ildren of his Charge therein) Besure the distinguishing Principles of it are plainly level'd against.&mdash;But I pray God, that this <HI>excellent Catechism</HI> may still be had in Esteem and Use among us, even to the latest Posterity, notwithstanding the Attempts made to disparage it. O that all were suitably disposed to honour such valu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> Remains of our worthy Ancestors, and to
<PB N="27" REF="006902_0042_0F6726CE9FFB6C78">
<HI>remember them which have spoken to us the good Word of God, and to follow their Faith, considering the End of their Conversation.</HI>&mdash;But I come, as was proposed,</P>
<P N="2">2. To rehearse, in our Author's own Words, some of the many injurious Reflections, he has cast on those Expo|sitors and others, and hint at some of his Misrepresentati|ons of their Opinions.&mdash;By the Title of his Discourse, <HI>Protestant</HI> Expositors in general, with many <HI>Protestant</HI> Preachers and others, who understand his Text to intend the Saints acknowledgement of their <HI>own Righteousnesses</HI> to be <HI>as filthy Rags,</HI> all these (I say) stand expresly indited before the World, of <HI>Absurdity</HI> and <HI>Blasphemy</HI> in <HI>deprecia|ting moral Vertue;</HI> and he thus draws their black Cha|racter in the Discourse itself (<HI>Page</HI> 6.) <Q>Certain it is, that the Word of God&mdash;has either thro' the <HI>Weakness, In|attention</HI> and <HI>Ignorance,</HI> or more criminal Designs of its Expositors, (by some such I say) in all Ages of the World been <HI>wretchedly abused,</HI> to serve the Purposes of <HI>Error, Superstition</HI> and <HI>Vice.</HI>&mdash;And perhaps nothing has had a more fatal Tendency to delude the Simple, and harden the Prophane, than judging of Scripture Doc|trines from particular <HI>Scraps</HI> of Scripture, and from the bare <HI>Jingle</HI> of Words, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>And then this Gentleman (<HI>Page</HI> 7.) in enumerating the particular Opinions (concerning Election, original Sin&mdash;) held by these Expositors and others, tells us, <Q>that for want of attending to the real Design and Drift of the Author, and to the whole current of Inspiration, as to the Point under Examination,</Q> it has come to pass that when they have met with this or the other <HI>historical</HI> Pas|sage in Scripture, (several of which he alludes to) "they have rashly concluded," this and the other <HI>Doctrine</HI> to be founded on the Word of God.&mdash;Then he goes on to say, <Q>Thus <HI>stupified</HI> and <HI>bewildred with Sounds,</HI> without at|tending to the <HI>true Sense</HI> of Revelation, the pure and perfect <HI>Religion</HI> of <HI>Jesus</HI>&mdash;is in many Places turned into an <HI>idle Speculation, a mysterious Faith, a senseless Supersti|tion, and a groundless Recumbency;</HI> and in short, every

Thing but what in Fact it is.</Q>&mdash;And he observes (<HI>Page</HI> 8.) <Q>The like <HI>Delusions,</HI> and by the same Means, have been introduced, in judging our spiritual Estate.</Q> <Q>Here he mentions several Instances, and particularly observes how some <HI>imagine, God has from all Eternity set his Love up|on them</HI></Q>&mdash;<Q>Others (says he) you will find amusing themselves, because they have the <HI>perfect Righteousness</HI> of Christ <HI>imputed to them.</HI></Q>&mdash;And he speaks of <Q>their <HI>affected</HI> Sorrow and groaning for Sin, especially for the Sins of <HI>others</HI> they never had any Handin:</Q>&mdash;which looks like a sarcastical Sneer at those that bewail and lament their <HI>own</HI> and <HI>others</HI> Sins and indwelling Corruptions. Perhaps he has not considered that remarkable Text, Ezek. 9. 2, 4. <HI>He that was cloathed in Linnen, with the Writer's Inkborn by his Side,</HI>&mdash;was commanded to <HI>go through the midst of the City, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a Mark upon the Foreheads of the Men that sigh and that cry for all the</HI> ABOMINATIONS, <HI>that be done in the midst thereof.</HI>&mdash;Our Author appears to be something upon his Guard here, and perhaps with a View to leaving open a Door for his Retreat, in Case his Dis|course should meet with Opposition, has thrust in qua|lifying Clauses, or restraining Phrases, not only in his Account of the Delusions he instances in, but also in his Description of the <HI>commonly received Doctrines,</HI> by which (as hinted before) he has not a little misrepresented them. For it is evident, by the general run of his Discourse, and by some pointed Passages in particular, that what he strikes at, is <HI>the commonly received Notion</HI> (as he phrases it) res|pecting one Doctrine &amp; another. And if he really meant not so, but had his Eye to some singular Enthusiastical Delusions, or Antinomian Dotages, I must say, then he has been <HI>but beating the Air,</HI> and in a great Degree been impertinent. Whereas doubtless he intended the Principles of Calvinists, and has by his soul Misrepresentations thrown a great deal of Dirt upon their Character.</P>
<P>Before he has passed very severe Censures on the <HI>commonly received Notion</HI> of his Text, and so constructively and ob|liquely

on all the <HI>Expositors</HI> and others that embrace that Meaning of the Text. He seems so offended and incen|sed at what he calls "this modern Stile of <HI>filthy Rags,</HI> as applied to the Vertues of good Men," that every Page al|most has Indications of his Displeasure at and Contempt for those who make this Application.&mdash;Thus he speaks (<HI>Page</HI> 18.)&mdash;<Q>Shall we call this, I say, <HI>filthy Rags?</HI>&mdash;God forbid! God forbid! Such a Thought should ever enter into our Hearts; and if thro' the <HI>Wickedness</HI> of them it should happen to steal in, let us look upon it as a <HI>greater Evil,</HI> and be more solicitous to cast it out, than if we were possessed with <HI>seven Devils.</HI></Q>&mdash;It fol|lows then, according to our Author,&mdash;where <HI>such a Tho't</HI> (upon his Text) has been already admitted by <HI>Expositors</HI> or others,&mdash;and he himself owns it is the <HI>Notion commonly received,</HI> This must be imputed to the Wickedness of their <HI>Hearts,</HI> unless a profound <HI>Ignorance</HI> may afford them some Excuse. And if any will still harbour such a Thought, especially after being instructed and warned by our <HI>Author,</HI> he declares them to be in a worse Case, than if they were possessed even with <HI>seven Devils.</HI>&mdash;And truly, according to this Gentleman's Discourse, if it be consider|ed how many <HI>pernicious Doctrines</HI> and <HI>Delusions</HI> are so nearly connected with the common Notion of his Text, he must needs suppose us, to be in a worse Condition than the Gadarene we read of, <HI>Mark</HI> 5. who being asked <HI>What is thy Name?</HI> answered, <HI>My Name is Legion,</HI> for we are many.&mdash;Accordingly our <HI>Author</HI> (Page 23.) repre|sents this <HI>Thought,</HI> and the Doctrines commonly connected with it, as the <Q>Fictions of weak or <HI>disordered</HI> Brains, every Article a down-right Affront to <HI>commonSense</HI></Q> and doubtless referring to those who entertain the same, he there speaks of some <Q>who by a few <HI>Rabble-charming Sounds</HI> are converted into such <HI>fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ry Bigots,</HI> as to be rea|dy to die, in the Defence of <HI>Stupidity</HI> and <HI>Nonsense?</HI></Q> Yea, <Q>even to kill&mdash;(and that for the Glory of God) all that are so <HI>heretical</HI> &amp; <HI>graceless</HI> as not to renounce their Reason in Complaisance to their <HI>sovereign Dictates</HI></Q>&mdash;

<P>There's one Reflection more, I shall take some Notice of, (tho' of a different Nature from the rest) and that is the remarkable Fling he has at a common Usage we have a|mong us,&mdash;That of keeping publick <HI>Fasts.</HI>&mdash;He takes Occasion to say upon it,&mdash;Page 9.&mdash;<Q>The Solemnities of a <HI>Fast-Day</HI>&mdash;your <HI>Saints</HI> that depend on their <HI>devo|tional Exercises,</HI> not only prefer to all other Duties, but are ready to imagine they are a sufficient Atonement for all their past Vices, and of greater Account <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">'pro|cure the Blessing of Heaven, than all the <HI>heathenish Morality,</HI> the <HI>abominable good Works,</HI> that can be preach|ed by all your legal <HI>Self-righteous</HI> Men on Earth.</Q> How came our Author to pick out Fast-Days, and not Thanksgiving Days as well, to make them the Subject of his Banter and Derision, when these are some of our usual Solemnities also? I leave others to judge the Reason. But it seems our Author has a wonderful Power of Penetration into the Sentiments of your Saints (as he terms them) on Fast-Days. However, tho' there is Danger on all Hands, of People's falling into the Error hinted at, car|nal Confidence in Duties, yet I presume to say, those who extol personal Righteousness in the Manner our Author very apparently has done, to the Disregard of imputed Righteousness, and who so applaud <HI>moral Vertue,</HI> to the Neglect of Faith in the Blood of Atonement, seem to me to be of all Men most in Danger of <HI>depending on their own Duties,</HI> whether devotional Exercises, or vertuo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s Practi|ces, and of cherishing a vain Hope, as if those would sufficiently atone for their past Sins, or as if by Works of Righteousness which they have done, and not according to his Mercy, God should save them.</P>

<P>It would be almost an endless Task, to go over all the Ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tances of Calumny and Satyr, that are of a personal Aspect, and to recite all the Misrepresentations &amp;Abuses, in Relation to Principles, which are to be found in his Discourse, with a particular Reply to each distinctly.

<P>I shall begin, as seems most natural, with some Remarks by Way of Vindication of those Expositors and others, against our Author's more <HI>general</HI> Reflections &amp; Censures. The Scandal he has thrown out on this Occasion, falls heavy on the Character of many eminent <HI>Worthies,</HI> from the Re|formation, down to this Day, and of the Ministers in <HI>New-England</HI> in particular.

our Author's Reflections and Misrepresentations with Regard to their Interpretations of the Words of his <HI>Text</HI> in particular, <HI>All our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags</HI>&mdash;These are scattered thro' his whole Discourse; some have (I think) been taken Notice of already, and others will come under Consideration in the Course of this Essay.&mdash;I shall therefore at present only single out a Passage or two, in which either wilfully or ignorantly he has misrepre|sented them.&mdash;Thus when he is reporting the common Notion of the Prophet's Words, he tells us, (<HI>Pa.</HI> 10.) <Q>The best Righteousness of the most improved Christians has been generally spoken of, as no better a <HI>Qualification</HI> (even according to the merciful Tenor of the Gospel) to appear before God with Acceptance, than <HI>filthy Rags</HI> are to dress and adorn the Body for a Visit to the King and Court on Earth.</Q> But these Expositors and others, when they speak of personal Righteousness as <HI>filthy Rags,</HI> don't at all respect it under the Notion of a moral <HI>Qualification</HI> for future Happiness and final Acceptance&punc; such constantly affirm the Necessity of inherent Righte|ousness, to make us (in the Gospel-Sense) <HI>meet to be Parta|kers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light:</HI> and yet they constantly and consistently renounce it as filthy Rags in Point of Justification before God, being utterly insuffici|ent to answer the Demands of his Law, and procure us an Interest in his special Favour and Acceptance, therefore they conclude with the Apostle, Rom. 5. 2. <HI>We have Ac|cess by Faith into this Grace,</HI> thro' Jesus Christ: they place their Title to divine Acceptance wholly in Christ's Law fulfilling Righteousness, made their's by Imputation on God's Part, and by a believing Acceptation, or receiving it by Faith, on the Believer's Part, which yet is not of them selves, but of the Grace of God enabling them thereto.

and Weight of the vindictive Justice of God, these and no others will fly to Christ, and lay hold of his Righteous|ness for Life and Salvation.

For any to suppose that meer moral Vertue and Self-Righte|ousness will recommend them to the Favour of God, is no better than for some high-handed Malefactor or Traytor to pretend to approach the Court or Presence of his Prince with|out a Pardon first obtained. Divine Pardon is obtained by the Righteousness of Christ, and not our own; because the Righteousness of the best Men living has so much of Imperfection and Pollution mixed with it, that Expositors and all others who duly consider the Case, must acknow|ledge with the Church by the Prophet in the Text, that <HI>all our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags.</HI> It must therefore be unreasonable, and I think, contrary to Scripture, for any to suppose, that such imperfect polluted sinful Crea|tures as the best of Men are in this Life, should obtain Favour with a just and holy God, <HI>without</HI> the perfect spot|less Righteousness of Christ imputed, and as has been said <HI>received by Faith:</HI> This, according to Scripture, and in the Sense of these Expositors, is the only justifying Righteous|ness, "even according to the merciful Tenor of the Gospel."

<P>But I proceed to take some Notice of another very ex|ceptionable Passage; I think it an Imposition on his Rea|ders, and a great Abuse upon these Expositors &amp; others, to in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inuate, as he does, <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g.</HI> 25&mdash;That they (absolutely speaking &amp; without any Manner of Caution or Restriction) <Q>asperse moral Vertue as <HI>nothing worth</HI> in the Sight of God, no more than filthy Rags</Q>!

It appears to me a very groundless Reflecti|on, if by <HI>moral Vertue</HI> he means true Gospel-Holiness, (in which Sense I think he can't be understood, by the whole Scope of his Discourse before us)&mdash;However, let him name the Man that ever asserted it as <HI>nothing worth</HI> in the Sight of God, speaking absolutely and without any Limitation or particular Respect: Let him name the Man who was constantly telling the People, <Q><HI>All</HI> their Righteousness, when they <HI>have obtained it, will be nothing but filthy Rags,</HI></Q> in every Sense, and in all Respects. And if he can't, or won't do this, what must we judge of his <HI>Misrepresenta|tion,</HI> but that it is wilful? and therefore must stand as a de|signed Reproach, with all unprejudiced Judges; and such as is very much <HI>aggravated</HI> in the Circumstances of it,&mdash;delivered on the Lord's Day,&mdash;Sermon-wise,&mdash;and level'd against many of his Fathers and Superiours; so is a Breach
<PB N="45" REF="006902_0060_0F6726DE666CF5B8">
of a variety of Commandments in the moral Law!&mdash;However, I would not forget to Note by the Way, that amidst all his Exclamations against these Expositors and Preachers, for <HI>depreciating</HI> moral Vertue, our Author has seen fit here to make a Concession in their Favour; (tho' it be done in an ill Manner,&mdash;with a View, as it plainly appears, to make them guilty of a <HI>Self-Contradiction&punc;</HI>)&mdash;The Concession is implied in the Passage last refer'd to; which begins thus,&mdash;<Q>To speak freely, I never yet saw with what Face a Man can pretend to exhort others to the Practice of Righteousness, who is continually telling them</Q>&mdash;(the rest you had before) It seems then that however this Gentleman is incensed against those Calvi|nistical Ministers, he here appears willing to grant, that they don't neglect exhorting others to the <HI>Practice of Righ|teousness;</HI> and certainly it were the highest Injustice to the Memory of the Dead, and to the Character of the Living, not to allow them the Repute of their exhorting to the Practice of Righteousness: so that, for ought I see, they still preserve some little Kindness for <HI>moral Vertue,</HI> after all that is pretended about their <HI>depreciating</HI> it, even their Enemies themselves being Judges.&mdash;Indeed such as our Author intends thus to fault, don't <HI>exhort to the Practice of Righteousness,</HI> just in such a Manner as perhaps he &amp; some others may,&mdash;as if they look'd upon Righteousness to be meerly a <HI>Habit,</HI> acquired by repeated <HI>Acts:</HI> But are wont to exhort others as the Scriptures do, to <HI>seek first the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness,</HI> to seek to God in earnest Prayer, accompanied with the diligent Use of the Means of Grace, that he would put his Spirit within them, and purify their Hearts by Faith, and implant in them a Principle of Righteousness, and enable them by Strength derived from Christ <HI>thro' Faith</HI> to work Righteousness, and to shew their Faith by good Works, and Acts of moral Virtue.&mdash;Tho' they lay out much of their Ministry, it's true, in exhibiting a Redeemer, and preaching Salvation by Grace thro' Faith in him; yet agreable to the Charge given them <HI>Tit.</HI> 3. 8. one View they have in so <HI>constantly affirming

these Things,</HI> is, <HI>That they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good Works.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>However, I perceive our Author is stumbled at their Conduct; and the Mystery with him lies here,&mdash;that he does not know very well how to reconcile their <HI>Exhorta|tions to the Practice of Righteousness,</HI> with their <HI>Doctrine</HI> of Justification by <HI>imputed Righteousness,</HI> or (which comes to the same Thing) with their telling People, that in Relation to that Affair, <HI>All their Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags:</HI> and he says upon it, as is before hinted, "I never saw <HI>with what Face,</HI>" they could thus <HI>exhort</HI> &amp; thus <HI>teach</HI> at the same time. Doubtless he reckons it a very glaring <HI>Contradiction,</HI> and an odious <HI>Inconsistency,</HI> that requires a good Stock of Assurance in any to venture upon it.&mdash;But to speak freely also in my Turn, I note here, That it is not hard to discern what a <HI>Face</HI> our Author put on, when he gave himself such a Liberty, beyond all Bounds of Modesty, to cast (as doubtless he intended) Reproach on the Ministers and Preachers of the Gospel in general thro' the Land, not only such as are surviving at this Day in their Charges, but those also that are gone to Rest in the several past Generations: For it is well known, that the Ministers, mostly, and I may venture to say, near to a Man, were in their Principles <HI>Calvinistical,</HI> as now they are distinguished; which Note of Distinction has but late|ly arose among us, occasioned very much by the late Growth and Discovery of <HI>Arminianism,</HI> which has now made it's open and formidable Appearance in some of our Churches.</P>
<P>Our Author might perhaps offer this Flight of Re|flection on so many eminent Ministers of Jesus Christ, as supposing it to add a Grace to his Discourse, and be the more taking with the unthinking Part of his Audience (and Readers) and all that are prejudiced in Favour of the Errors he had advanced.</P>
<P>But let that be as it will, this I am sure of, If I may be allowed to depend upon my Bible, which tells me it plainly, That <HI>without Faith it is impossible to please God.</HI>&mdash;If so, I
<PB N="47" REF="006902_0062_0F6726E13150F060">
hope I may be allowed to say, without being branded with the Imputation of a <HI>Blasphemer</HI> for <HI>depreciating moral Vertue,</HI> that whatever Pretences are made to Religion, which are but meerly <HI>moral,</HI> the most refined Vertues, void of a saving <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, and without his <HI>imputed Righte|ousness,</HI> will be but as <HI>filthy Rags,</HI>&mdash;and can give no more Title to final Justification in the Sight of God, than if a Man <HI>cut off a Dog's Neck, or offered Swines Blood in Sacrifice under the Law.</HI></P>
<P>Our Author goes on in his Reflections upon these Ex|positors and Preachers. He represents them not only as telling People, that <HI>all</HI> their <HI>Righteousnesses</HI> are nothing but <HI>filthy Rags;</HI> but insinuates also, as if they were constantly telling them in the Words following, (<HI>Pa.</HI> 25) <Q>God is already satisfyed in all his Demands, his Law, his Ho|nour, his rigorous relentless Justice, are all satisfyed, and there is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hing left for Man to do, but to believe this undoubtingly, and&mdash;to rely upon it, that he is righ|teous, and shall finally be accepted as such.</Q>&mdash;And then proceeds to say&mdash;<Q>The Believer indeed may, if he please, out of meer Generosity, add Works of Righteous|ness; but really there is no Need of it; for his main Interest is secure without it.</Q>&mdash;All this, our Author insinuates, is the Language of those Preachers, that believe and preach the Doctrine of Christ's <HI>Satisfaction</HI> and <HI>parti|cular Redemption.</HI> But those that are thus free to offer their <HI>magisterial Censures,</HI> may do well to give heed to the Caution given, Jam. 3. 14, 15.&mdash;<HI>Lie not against the Truth,&mdash;This Wisdom is not from above.</HI>&mdash;Those Persons indeed that are prejudiced in their Minds against the Doctrine abovementioned, and other fundamental Doct|rines of Christianity, may with this Gentleman <HI>darken the Truth</HI>&mdash;and put Things under very wrong &amp; disadvanta|gious <HI>Representations;</HI> which can't be help'd that I know of: but for One that wears the Character of a Minister, thus to reproach the Doctrines of Christ, and the Professors of them, who have been &amp; are the Glory of this Land and of our Churches, as Assertors of the Truth as it is in Christ

But do they, by all this, <HI>make void the Law thro' Faith?

They find that the Scrip|tures, in setting forth the glorious Scheme of Man's Sal|vation by Jesus Christ, represent the Foundation of it as laid in <HI>the eternal Purpose of Grace,</HI> or the Counsel of God (as is before hinted) before the World was; and accord|ingly that they speak of the saved of the Lord as <HI>from the Beginning chosen to Salvation;</HI> as <HI>chosen in Christ before th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

So that the Rashness reflected on others, falls necessarily on himself.</P>
<P>He proceeds on the like Strain of Reflection, in a fol|lowing Paragraph, <HI>Pa.</HI> 8. <Q>Some, and those not a few, are full of Hope in God; because, as they <HI>imagine,</HI> he has from all <HI>Eternity,</HI> and that not only <HI>without any Rea|son,</HI> but in direct <HI>Opposition</HI> to the very Nature &amp; essen|tial Constitution of his <HI>moral Government,</HI> set his <HI>Love upon them.</HI></Q>&mdash;The Doctrine of the <HI>Decrees,</HI> in common with every other Scripture-Doctrine, is liable to be abused to vile and pernicious Purposes; and it's readily granted, if a Man can give no other <HI>Reason of the Hope that is in him,</HI> but only that he imagines himself from all Eternity <HI>chosen</HI> to Salvation, such a Man has just Ground to fear, that he imagines a <HI>vain Thing,</HI> and that his Hope will make him ashamed.&mdash;The true Christian's hope of <HI>E|lection</HI> is built not upon mere <HI>Imagination,</HI> but upon Scrip|ture-Evidence of Sanctification, wrought in him by the Power of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> together with his own Experi|ence, that thro' Grace, (and not by meer <HI>moral</HI> Duties) he is enabled more and more to die unto Sin, and live unto Righteousness.&mdash;If then we may lay Stress upon Scrip|ture-Testimony with Respect to the Doctrine of the De|crees, and consequently, that of the <HI>Election of Grace;</HI> the Insinuations of this Author, by way of Contempt there|on, are mere Amusements, and tend only to darken the Counsel of God; which I shall endeavour to prove, from plain Scripture-Evidence; and those that will not shut their Eyes against clear <HI>Gospel-Light,</HI> must, I think, own their Delusion, that plead the contrary.

<P>I proceed now to another of our Author's Reflections.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Instance he brings, of Expositors <HI>rashly concluding</HI>&mdash;respects the Doctrine of <HI>original Sin.</HI>&mdash;He thus states the Case, <HI>Pa.</HI> 7. <Q>That when they have laid before them the Character of a very loose and abandon|ed <HI>People,</HI> who by their own long <HI>practised</HI> Wickedness have rendered themselves the Children of Wrath, and fitted themselves for Destruction,&mdash;they are induced to vilify <HI>human Nature</HI> itself, with the same vicious Cha|racter.</Q>&mdash;Here we have him insinuating again, as if Protestant <HI>Expositors,</HI> and such as join with them in the Point of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> had nothing to support or counte|nance their Opinion, but some Passages of <HI>historical</HI> Scripture grosly misapplied. He doubtless alludes to such Texts as these, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6. 5. <HI>Psal.</HI> 14. 1,&mdash;3. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 1,&mdash;3.&mdash;Which, I suppose, our Author would have considered only as spoken in Reference to the corrupt Condition of the Men of the <HI>old World,</HI>&mdash;the People of the <HI>Jews</HI> in some remarkable Season of epidemical prevailing Dege|neracy,&mdash;and the Citizens of <HI>Ephesus</HI> in their heathen State: and I suppose, he would have these Texts interpreted as only describing them (respectively) from the actual Wick|edness
<PB N="57" REF="006902_0072_0F6726E8DFE3A2A0">
of their Lives, and not at all implying any Account of what they were by native Disposition.</P>
<P>But as to the first Text&mdash;<HI>Gen.</HI> 6. 5.&mdash;I think, this Gen|tleman must see his Mistake in such a Thought, if he will only compare the above-named first Text with <HI>Gen.</HI> 8. 21.&mdash;where it is declared by God himself, who knows the Hearts of Men, their State and Dispositions, that they were the same in the <HI>new World,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> after the Flood, as they were in the <HI>Old</HI> before it: for God pronounces up|on all Men indefinitely, that the <HI>Imagination of their Heart is Evil from their Youth, and continually so,</HI> accord|ing to the natural Bent &amp; Bias of the Mind. Now does God by this <HI>vilify human Nature!</HI> or do Expositors by believing what God has revealed Man to be by Nature, and teaching the Doctrine of <HI>original Sin,</HI> induce Men to <HI>vilify</HI> human Nature?&mdash;This Doctrine therefore is not received <HI>rashly,</HI> but upon <HI>divine Testimony.</HI> Let our Author then solemnly consider in the Fear of God, where his Reflection will at last terminate, unless he can prove the Case to be otherwise than it is here represented.</P>
<P>And as to the next Scripture mentioned above, <HI>Psal.</HI> 14. 1,&mdash;3. I desire this Gentleman to compare it with <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 10,&mdash;12. where the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> recites much of that Psalm, and applies it to <HI>prove,</HI> in Regard of <HI>Gentiles</HI> as well as <HI>Jews,</HI> that <HI>they are all under Sin:</HI> And what can this Author's sharp Reflection on Expositors and others be, but a tacit Reflection on the inspired Writer himself, who in the like Way applied Texts, even as he was mov|ed by the <HI>Holy Ghost?</HI>&mdash;And now as to the last mentioned Text, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 1,&mdash;3. It is plain that the Apostle did not design meerly to describe a State of <HI>Heathenism;</HI> but had in View the State of <HI>Nature,</HI> common to all Mankind.&mdash;For in his Description of the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> he not only speaks of <HI>their Conversation in Times past,</HI> but also points out the Source of their actual Wickedness, the <HI>Lusts of the Flesh, and Desires of the Mind;</HI> and accordingly declares it of them expresly, that they <HI>were by Nature Children of Wrath, even as others,</HI> whether <HI>Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> or <HI>Gentiles.</HI>&mdash;Nay, it's worthy
<PB N="58" REF="006902_0073_0F6726E9B2783638">
of Observation, the Apostle not only mentions othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> indefinitely, but extends his Description <HI>universally</HI> unto all; and comprehends even <HI>himself</HI> in this whole Descrip|tion; saying, <HI>Among whom also</HI> WE ALL <HI>had</HI> OUR <HI>Conver|sation,</HI>&mdash;in the <HI>Lusts of</HI> OUR <HI>Flesh</HI>&mdash;and <HI>were</HI> (we were) by <HI>Nature Children of Wrath,&mdash;even when</HI> WE <HI>were dead in Sins</HI> (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 5&mdash;)&mdash;Like as the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> when repenting of actual Sin, runs up to the Fountain-Head and Original of all, a corrupt Nature. Psal.51. 5. <HI>Behold, I was shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</HI> Was this <HI>David's</HI> Case alone? No verily; we all, the whole Race of <HI>Adam,</HI> are, were, and shall be, <HI>conceived</HI> and <HI>shapen</HI> in like Manner.&mdash;For this we have also the Apostle's Testi|mony, tho' not in the same Words, but the like Meaning, in his Epistle to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> before noted; and in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans</HI> he does the same, yet more re|markably: for there he not only represents Sin as <HI>Epi|demical</HI> and <HI>Native,</HI> but <HI>Hereditary;</HI> descending to <HI>Adam'</HI>s <HI>Posterity</HI> throughout all <HI>Generations</HI> in Succession; pointing out the true <HI>Origin</HI> of this universal Corruption of <HI>human Nature,</HI> and resolving it into <HI>Adam's</HI> Fall.&mdash;He perempto|rily and repeatedly asserts, <HI>By</HI> ONE <HI>Man's Disobedience</HI> MANY <HI>were made Sinners.</HI>&mdash;<HI>By</HI> ONE <HI>Man Sin enter'd into the World, and Death by Sin.&mdash;Therefore by the Offence of</HI> ONE&mdash;<HI>Judgment came upon</HI> ALL <HI>Men to Condemnation</HI>&mdash;Rom. 5. 12, 18, 19.&mdash;Such Texts as these, plainly of a <HI>doctrinal</HI> Aspect, are the principal Scripture-Proofs, relied on to support the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>original Sin,</HI> as commonly received by Protestant Expositors.&mdash;And now it may be supposed, our Author will excuse the <HI>Apostle</HI> from the Im|putation of <HI>Weakness</HI> and <HI>Rashness</HI> in his Conclusions&punc; and under his Umbrage and <HI>Authority</HI> the poor Expositors&mdash;will(we hope) escape the hard Censures of this Author and others for the future,&mdash;for <HI>vilifying human Nature it self,</HI> as is pretended.</P>
<P>Many Things might be offered here for the further Confirmation of this weighty <HI>scriptural Doctrine;</HI> as, after what has been said, I may venture to call it.&mdash;But&punc; I
<PB N="59" REF="006902_0074_0F6726EA69E8C280">
shall only add, That tho' <HI>all have sinned, and come short of the Glory of God,</HI> in one common Fall, yet there are some that by a wicked &amp; profligate Life do indeed vilify <HI>human Nature,</HI> and make themselves more the <HI>Children of Wrath,</HI> than they were in their native State.&mdash;And tho&punc; some are restrained by Grace, and others perhaps by the influence of a religious Education or otherwise, yet naturally all have in an evil Heart the <HI>Seeds</HI> or <HI>Principles</HI> of all that <HI>Wickedness,</HI> which is ever <HI>practised</HI> by the vilest and most abandoned Sinners under the Sun. So that in this Respect even <HI>Infants,</HI> in a State of Nature, are of a <HI>vicious Character,</HI> in the Sight of a holy and Heart-searching God; the very <HI>same</HI> Character, inKind, with that of the most dissolute and hardned in Wickedness.</P>
<P>It is undoubted, that Christ is a Saviour to <HI>Infants,</HI> as well as others, and he is a Saviour only to <HI>Sinners.</HI>&mdash;Ac|cordingly <HI>all</HI> that he <HI>died for,</HI> have this Character expresly ascribed to them in common. Rom. 5. 6, 8.&mdash;<HI>Christ died for the Ungodly&mdash;While we were yet Sinners, Christ died for us.</HI> And 1 Pet. 3. 18. <HI>Christ also hath once suffered for Sins, the Just for the Unjust.</HI>&mdash;So then, if <HI>Infants</HI> are included in the Number of them for whom <HI>Christ died,</HI> they are also in|cluded among those, who in the Account of Scripture sustain the Character of <HI>Sinners, Ungodly, Unjust.</HI>&mdash;And hence it appears, there is no <HI>specifical</HI> (but only a <HI>gradual</HI>) Difference, between the moral <HI>Character</HI> of an unregenerate <HI>Babe,</HI> and that of a <HI>Man</HI> long inured to Wickedness. Else, for ought I see, the Practice of <HI>Infant-Baptism</HI> must be gi|ven up.&mdash;If our Author denies <HI>original Sin,</HI> in the Sense I have shewn, I apprehend it proper for <HI>him</HI> to join himself to the <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> or some other such Sect, as unworthy of Fellowship with the Churches here, or with the <HI>established</HI> Church at <HI>Home,</HI> according to their <HI>primitive</HI> Profession and Constitution.</P>
<P N="3">3. The next Instance of our Author's Reflections on these Expositors, that I shall take Notice of, is what respects the Doctrine of <HI>Efficacious Grace.</HI>&mdash;His Words are these&punc; <Q>That when they hear of our being saved by Grace,
<PB N="60" REF="006902_0075_0F6726EB2439C9D8">
they conceive of it so as to <HI>destroy all moral Agency,</HI> and set themselves down with this vain Thought, that no|thing on their Part is necessary to Salvation, but if they are designed for it, they shall irresistably be driven into Heaven, whether they will, or not: And if they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot, no Prayers, or Endeavours will avail.</Q></P>
<P>The manifest Tendency (if not Design) of this Author's Discourse in this Place, and in other Parts of it, is, to ren|der the essential Doctrines profess'd in these Churches ge|nerally, as odious in the Eyes of People as possible: And he here strikes at our Doctrine of Conversion, insinuating, that People are lead hereby to draw corrupt Conclusions, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That if they are to be <HI>saved by Grace,</HI> then in Point of <HI>Means</HI> they have nothing required of them, but are ex|cused from all Duties and Endeavours on their Part, and as he represents it, <Q><HI>If they are design'd for Heaven, they</HI> shall <HI>irresistably be driven into it, whether they will or not.</HI></Q> We may observe, in what a scoffing and deriding Manner he treats the <HI>holy</HI> Things of God, and how he imposes on the Ignorant. This is the Fruit of his own <HI>Invention,</HI> however he may pretend to personate others in it,&mdash;and calculated exactly to the Genius of the <HI>profane</HI> and <HI>irre|ligious</HI> Part of Mankind. For I suppose, this Author or any other can't produce any single Instance, among such as are sober, religious and intelligent Christians (much less among learned Expositors and Preachers) holding this Doctrine I am speaking of, that will so much as think they have nothing at all to do: when they have so much Experience of the Remains of Corruption in them, through the <HI>Depravity</HI> of their <HI>Natures,</HI> that needs to be mortifi|ed and subdued, and therefore labour constantly, in the Use of God's appointed Means, to <HI>work out their Sal|vation with Fear and Trembling;</HI> And know, that if ever they expect to have <HI>an Entrance ministred to them into Heaven,</HI> they must <HI>use all Diligence to make their Calling and Election sure,</HI> and <HI>follow Holiness</HI> with unceasing De|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s and Endeavours to the last.</P>
<P>It is therefore but a meer Amusement and Reproach,

for him to charge as he does, the Expositors and others I am labouring to vindicate, &amp; the Doctrines taught by them. There are indeed many poor in considerate Souls, among the unthinking Multitude, that are ready to apply this Doctrine to such a perverse Purpose.&mdash;For there are none of the Doctrines of <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">vel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tion,</HI> how plain, practical and important <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oever, but what have sometimes and by some evil disposed Persons been wretchedly abused; nay, none of the first Principles of <HI>Reason,</HI> but what have often been shamefully pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">verted.

<P>The next Thing I shall take Notice of, is that Reflec|tion this Gentleman casts on the <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> pro|fessed by faithful <HI>Expositors,</HI> and <HI>Preachers</HI> of the Gospel, with others, from the Reformation, particularly in <HI>New|England.</HI>&mdash;He reflects in this Manner, (Pag. 7.) <Q>Thus stupified and bewildered with Sounds, without attend|ing to the true Sense of Revelation, the pure &amp; perfect

And it were well, if some among us had followed <HI>their Example;</HI> and if our Author particularly had done so, for the Good of that <HI>Church</HI> and People he stands in a particular Relation to.&mdash;He also adds,&mdash;<Q>The pure and perfect Religion of JESUS, (which contains the most refined System of <HI>Morality</HI> the World was ever blessed with;</Q>&mdash;) None <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I know of, will deny, that <HI>the Religion of Jesus</HI> is <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>perfect,</HI> or that it <HI>contains the most refined System of Morality,</HI> incomparably excelling the best <HI>Pagan</HI> Phi|losophers Systems, and even those of the best uninspired <HI>Jewish</HI> Doctors.&mdash;The moral Law is delivered to us in the sacred Scriptures with the greatest Perfection and Pu|rity; and is there considered as of immutable and eternal Obligation. Our Saviour therefore declares, that it was not the End of his coming (as some might vainly imagine) <HI>to destroy the Law, but to fulfill it,</HI> Matth. 5. 17.&mdash;i. e. to <HI>fulfill the Law,</HI> in the Capacity of his People's Surety, for the Ends of making Satisfaction to divine Justice, and providing a justifying Righteousness for them, as well as to teach them the true Meaning of the <HI>Law,</HI> and set them an Example of Obedience for their Imitation. And tho' none are able to <HI>fulfill all Righteousness,</HI> as he did; yet <HI>as many as the Father hath given him, are predestinated to be conformed to the Image of the Son of God:</HI> Therefore <HI>we</HI> should be, in our Measure, <HI>in the World, as he was in the World;</HI> and should <HI>walk, even as he walked,</HI> who was the most illustrious Pattern of good Works, and followed ex|actly the Rules of true <HI>Morality.</HI> But for any to pretend, as this Author insinuates, that Christ came only to <HI>settle a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Morality,</HI> and that this he <HI>taught principally,</HI> when

<P>However, notwithstanding all this, I wou'd by no Means be understood as designing to shut true <HI>Morality</HI> out of the Religion of <HI>Jesus,</HI> as tho' it had no proper Place there. For indeed we can never <HI>do Righteousness,</HI> without <HI>Mora|lity;</HI> nor can we <HI>shew our Faith</HI> in Christ, as we ought, without <HI>Works;</HI> nor have we sufficient Evidence of our vital Union to him, without a constant Care of Confor|mity to him in all the Instances of moral Duty. If this be wanting, it's a Sign, that our Faith is <HI>dead,</HI> and our Reli|gion <HI>vain:</HI> So our own Hearts will condemn us, and can never witness for us that we have <HI>Faith unfeigned.</HI> Nor can others, without <HI>beholding our good Conversation in Christ,</HI> have sufficient Grounds of a rational Charity for us, that we are sincere in the Profession of the Religion of Jesus, and have felt the Power of it in our Souls.&mdash;But after all that has been, or ever can be said in Favour of <HI>Morality,</HI> this Author's Insinuation (that the <HI>pure and perfect Reli|gion of Jesus</HI> consists only or principally in this refined System of Morality) is groundless, and founded on meer. <HI>Arminian</HI> Presumption: for neither Scripture nor Reason is produced, to prove this Assertion of his; nor indeed can be by any other: And I hope, none are so stupidly blind, as to go away satisfied with an <HI>Ipse dixit.</HI></P>
<P>Before I come to the next general Head of Remarks, I shall take a little further Notice of this Author's Reflec|tion on the Religion mostly profess'd in these <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> Churches, and by the Ministers in them, that we ap|prehend to be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound in the Faith which is in Christ Jesus.</HI>

And I suppose, if our Author had duely consulted the Rules of his so much applauded <HI>Morality,</HI> he wou'd have found no Room for such abusive Invectives against us, whatever deep rooted Prejudice he may be under against the <HI>Faith</HI> we profess.</P>
<P>This Author insinuates, on the other Hand, that his <HI>refined System of Morality</HI> is <Q>a Doctrine of <HI>Sobriety, Righ|teousness,</HI> and <HI>Piety.</HI></Q> But, <HI>moral Piety, Sobriety</HI> and <HI>Righteousness,</HI> are these the only Lessons to be learned of <HI>Christianity!</HI> Are they so much as the first Principles of the <HI>Doctrine of</HI> CHRIST!

<P>It is evident, that the whole Tenor and Scope of this Author's Discourse we are upon, is, to disparage, and draw in as dark Colours as possible, the Doctrines we pro|fess, and indeed the whole of our Religion, tho' founded on the plain and unerring <HI>Authority of divine Revelation&punc;</HI> To that End he brings it under the Odium of <Q>an <HI>idle Speculation,</HI>&mdash;and a <HI>groundless Recumbancy:</HI></Q> Which Passages have already had some Notice taken of them, and may perhaps fall under a further Consideration in the fol|lowing Remarks.</P>
<P>The constructive Language of his Discourse, from the Beginning to the End, is, <Q>You have no Need at all to go beyond or without your selves for a Righteousness to justify you before God.</Q>&mdash;Else, whence is it, that he casts so much Obloquy upon Expositors and others, that put a Sense on his Text different from the Notion he has taken up of it?

He is so far from this, that the whole Construction of his Discourse is rather calculated in full <HI>Opposition</HI> to this <HI>Pro|testant</HI> Doctrine: And numerous Passages in it, I appre|hend, are most plainly of an unfavourable Aspect. I will instance in a few, for a Specimen; and make some Re|marks upon them. Thus, in proposing the Point that he undertakes to demonstrate (Pag. 11th of his Discourse) he expresly professes to maintain, <Q>That neither <HI>All</HI> nor any of our Righteousness, when true and genuine, sincere and universal, can <HI>possibly,</HI> consistent with Reason, Revelati|on, and even so much as common Sense, deserve this odi|ous Character of <HI>filthy Rags.</HI></Q>&mdash;This Gentleman here, as in the other Parts of his Discourse, seems to deliver him|self in unusual Phrases, and a Manner of Expression which carrys much of Ambiguity in it, tending rather to amuse, than instruct People in general; without any Explanation of his Meaning, for the most Part; and <HI>destitute</HI> of Scrip|ture-Proof,

And it's readily granted, that the <HI>Righte|ousnesses</HI> in these two Cases are exempt: But among all the natural Race of apostate <HI>Adam,</HI> where was there at any Time, or in any Instance, found a <HI>compleat Character of spotless Vertue?</HI> What faith the Scripture? <HI>There is not a just Man upon Earth, that doeth good, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inneth not.</HI> Eccl. 7. 20. Now so far as the just Man <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inneth,</HI> he certainly stains his moral <HI>Character,</HI> and detracts from his personal <HI>Righteousness,</HI> or Conformity to the <HI>Law</HI> of God, the Rule of Righteousness; which, as it demands <HI>Perfection</HI> of O|bedience, can never in Reason be supposed to take up sa|tisfied with an <HI>imperfect</HI> and <HI>spotted</HI> Obedience. Therefore such an <HI>Obedience</HI> as is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with <HI>Sin,</HI> can never be sup|posed available to <HI>justify</HI> us, in a due Process of <HI>Law;</HI> one <HI>Jot</HI> or <HI>Tittle</HI> of which God will not <HI>suffer to pass away.</HI> Consequently we must conclude, that in Relation to our being justified before God, against the Challenges of his holy and indispensable <HI>Law,</HI> verily <HI>all our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags.</HI>&mdash;It is a Matter worthy of strict Notice&punc; that when we apply this diminutive Character of <HI>filthy Rags</HI> to personal <HI>Righteousness,</HI> it is considered as viewed existing in it's <HI>Subject,</HI> a morally imperfect Creature, and with Res|pect to the grand Affair of <HI>Justification</HI> before God. In this Regard, I think, <HI>all the Righteousnesses</HI> of <Q>the most im|proved Christians</Q> may be fitly compared to <HI>filthy Rags</HI> (whatever this Author or any others may suggest to the contrary) without the least Inconsistency, either with <HI>Rea|son, Revelation, or commonSense.</HI> For (as was before shewn) it is Men's <HI>moral Vertues</HI> and <HI>personal</HI> Righteousnesses be|ing so highly applauded, and placed in the Room of the <HI>imputed</HI> Righteousness of Christ, that is here and by every

one ought to be condemned, as erroneous and corrupt, whatever plausible Pretensions may be insinuated, to blind Men's Minds, and pervert their Judgments.&mdash;It is the plain, direct, and infallible <HI>Gospel-Rule,</HI> that the Faith of <HI>Confessors</HI> to the <HI>Truth,</HI> in this and other Lands, is built on: And this, I pray God, we may continue to adhere to, and defend, in Opposition to and open Defiance of all that either the Art of Man, or Powers below, can suggest with Respect to the <HI>Vertues of Morality</HI> or a personal Righte|ousness being a fit or sufficient Intitlement to Acceptance in the Sight of God, either here in our Acts of religious <HI>Worship,</HI> or hereafter in giving our Account at the Tri|bunal of Jesus Christ.

<P>But again, this Author asserts, <HI>Pag.</HI> 15. <Q>From the Beginning of the Bible to the End of it, you will never find any the <HI>least</HI> &amp; most <HI>imperfect Degrees</HI> of real Good|ness branded with any such odious Character.</Q> To which I answer, Perhaps our Author will own, that <HI>Saul</HI> when he was a Pharis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, had some Degree of real Goodness in him, being <HI>as touching the Righteousness which is in the Law, blameless:</HI> Yet <HI>Paul</HI> the Apostle throws Disgrace on all his former Jewish Religion, as comparatively <HI>but Loss &amp; Dung,</HI> Phil. 3. 8. His moral Goodness, which was really <HI>good</HI> in it's Kind and Degree, yet he ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ts Contempt upon it, in Compare with Christ's Righteousness imputed to him, that <HI>Royal Robe</HI> with which he was then adorned.&mdash;And if Multitudes of <HI>Protestants,</HI> Expositors and others, have not been strangely deceived, this same Scripture furnishes me with an undeniable Instance to my present Purpose; and may be very justly (as it frequently has been) parallel'd with our Author's Text, taken according to the common|ly received meaning. <HI>Paul,</HI> now a Christian and an A|postle, cured of his Pharisaical Dependance on his <HI>moral Vertues,</HI> says there concerning <HI>all Things,</HI> including his

<P>Agreeable to the Drift of our Author's Discourse, I find him peremptorily asserting, <HI>Pag.</HI> 20. <Q>It is the Righte|ousness of the Saints</Q> [meaning <HI>their own moral</HI> Righ|teousness, which he insists on all along] <Q><HI>that renders them amiable</HI> in God's Sight, that is the <HI>Condition of all his Favours</HI> to them, and the <HI>sole Rule</HI> he will proceed by in judging them, and dispensing eternal <HI>Rewards</HI> to them. The Scriptures (says he) join with the <HI>natural Notions</HI> of our own Minds in all this, in the most plain and express Language imaginable.</Q>&mdash;To which I say,&mdash;It is very probable, as all Men since the Fall are by Nature Men of <HI>corrupt Minds,</HI> that the <HI>natural</HI> Notions of <HI>such</HI> Minds may concur with our Author in all this; and strongly conceit, that their own personal Righteousness "renders them amiable in God's Sight," and powerfully attracts his kind Regards to them; <HI>that this is </HI><Q><HI>the Con|dition of all his Favours to them,</HI></Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But I think, enough has been said to confute such a dan|gerous Error; and establish our Souls in the contrary weighty Truth, that it is <HI>the Righteousness of Faith,</HI> and not our own moral Vertue, which renders us <HI>amiable</HI> in the Sight of God, according to Scripture and sound Reason.&mdash;That which renders acceptable in his Sight, is the Righteous|ness of God our Saviour, which is <HI>upon all them that believe,</HI> i. e. with <HI>Faith unfeigned;</HI> and the Scripture calls it <HI>precious Faith:</HI> And surely it is in God's Account so, especially as it pays peculiar Honour to his <HI>dear Son,</HI> and is the Means by his special Appointment to invest us with <HI>Christ's Righ|teousness,</HI>

<P>What this Author offers, to support his Scheme of Sal|vation by <HI>moral Vertue</HI> from Psal. 18 23. <HI>I was upright before him&mdash;Therefore hath the Lord rewarded me accord|ing to my Righteousness:</HI>&mdash;This, I think, is foreign from his Purpose, and therefore will in no Way answer the De|sign he is upon. For it's probable, the Psalmist in these Passages, as well as in many other of the Psalms he penned, speaks not of <HI>himself</HI> personally, but prophetically and ty|pically of the MESSIAH; who indeed acted in all that he did, in the Perfection of <HI>Uprightness</HI> or <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and therefore has an indisputable Right to plead the Merit of it.&mdash;Otherwise, <HI>David</HI> must be necessarily charged (at least) with gross <HI>Iuconsistency,</HI> or rather the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> by whom he spake; which would amount to such a Degree of <HI>Blas|phemy,</HI> as this Author doubtless is very unwilling to fall under the Imputation of, however freely he has charged it upon Expositors and others, in a Matter of much smalle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P>This indeed is necessary in a Professor of Christi|anity: but to say, or pretend, that the Scripture or <Q><HI>Revelation every where suspends the whole of our Happi|ness</HI> on our <HI>personal good Behaviour,</HI></Q> as this Author does, is a perverting the Scripture.

And I have before observed, that this Au|thor has in Fact disowned or <HI>depreciated</HI> the main <HI>Design,</HI> or some of the essential <HI>Ends</HI> of the <HI>Mediator'</HI>s glorious Undertaking. Now that he has done this, at least virtu|ally and in Effect, I conclude, must be apparent to every judicious and unprejudic'd Reader; if he observes, what an universal <HI>Silence</HI> there is throughout his Discourse con|cerning some of the <HI>primary Ends</HI> of Christ's coming; which ought, and might have been taken special Notice of in <HI>Pag.</HI> 17, 18. as well as elsewhere.&mdash;But it seems, his Heart &amp; Mind was taken up to such a Degree in Fa|vour of his so much admired <HI>moral Vertue,</HI> and <HI>Christ'</HI>s <HI>settling the Scheme,</HI> and his Thoughts were so engrossed by this Self-pleasing Theme, as that he over-looks the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>ultimate Design</HI> of all, GOD's being <HI>glorified</HI> in the eternal Salvation of his Elect by Jesus Christ.&mdash;The Name of the incarnate Son of God was, by special Direction from Heaven, called <HI>Jesus</HI> on this Account, <HI>because he should save his People from their Sins.</HI> Matth. 1. 21.

The Prophets tell us, That the Messiah shou'd <HI>bear our Iniquities,</HI> be <HI>wounded for our Transgressions,</HI> and <HI>have the Chastisement of our Peace laid upon him; that he should finish Transgression, make an End of Sin,</HI> and <HI>bring in an everlasting Righteousness;</HI> that <HI>his Name shou'd be called The Lord our Righteousness;</HI> That <HI>in him shou'd all the Seed of Israel be justified,</HI> and <HI>shou'd glory,&mdash;saying, In him have I Righteousness and Strength;</HI> and in a Word; <HI>That by his Knowledge shou'd God's righteous Servant justify many.</HI>&mdash;Now it's evident, that Christ was born, and came into the World, for other and higher and more glorious Ends, than this Author does allow; which will prove it self, and

of Christ's <HI>Design</HI> (with its important Consequences) which is emphatically the <HI>mediatorial Design,</HI> on which Christ came into the World, I say, for any one openly to deny, or tacitly to disown, and treat with Neglect, such a <HI>funda|mental End</HI> of Christ's coming, which respects in a special Manner his <HI>Priestly</HI> Office, wherein also all his other high and distinguishing Characters are struck at, is in it's Na|ture and Consequence too nearly approaching to <HI>Blasphemy;</HI> and full freighted with <HI>Absurdity,</HI> yea, more than so, when done with Design, as seems to be the Case here in View,&mdash;by representing as if <HI>personal</HI> Righteousness were the only Thing that <HI>avails</HI> to obtain the <HI>Favour of God,</HI> and on which our <HI>whole</HI> Happiness is <HI>suspended;</HI> so making it properly our <HI>justifying</HI> Righteousness, and indeed our <HI>only</HI> Righteousness, in which to appear before God with Ac|ceptance.</P>

the Son of God, and on the whole <HI>Christian</HI>Scheme.</Q>&mdash;Surely, if our Author had had such a tender Regard (as is insinuated) for the Honour of <HI>Christ,</HI>&amp; the Vitals of Christi|anity, he would not have presumed, I think, to overlook some of the <HI>main</HI> &amp; <HI>essential Ends</HI> of Christ's coming, when enumerating them; nor to pretend, that the grandDesign was only to settle a Scheme of <HI>Morality,</HI> as a <HI>sufficient Righ|teousness;</HI> and so by a necessary Consequence (<HI>according to Him</HI>) it follows, that they who <HI>hear</HI> those <HI>Sayings of Christ,</HI> which <HI>he</HI> would have refer merely to <HI>Morality,</HI> and <HI>doeth them,</HI> are the only <HI>wise Men</HI> in the Earth, that have <HI>built</HI> their <HI>House upon a Rock,</HI> and are therefore in the saf|est and most happy State of all Mankind.

<P>Besides, if we consult <HI>Matth.</HI> 5. especially the <HI>third</HI> and <HI>sixth</HI> Verses, we shall find our Author greatly <HI>mistaken,</HI> in asserting, that it was <HI>this</HI> and <HI>only</HI> this moral Righteousness, which Christ preached up, in the <HI>whole</HI> of his divine Sermon on the Mount.&mdash;</P>
<P>Many Arguments might be drawn from these and o|ther Parts of that Sermon of Christ, to evidence, that it is

<HI>Faith,</HI> even such a Faith as leads the Soul out of <HI>Self,</HI> to <HI>hunger and thirst after</HI> CHRIST and his <HI>Righteousness,</HI> un|der a Sense of our own spiritual <HI>Poverty,</HI> hath the Promise of being <HI>filled</HI> or satisfied. This carries in it the <HI>Sum</HI> and <HI>Substance,</HI> the Essentials of that pure and holy Religion of <HI>Jesus,</HI> which he has taught us in the Gospel; not exclud|ing, but drawing after it the Practice of moral Duties, which Christ has enjoined on all them that profess them|selves his Followers.&mdash;Our Author proceeds to say, <HI>Pag.</HI> 18. <Q>In his Life and Practice he <HI>fulfilled all Righteousness,</HI> not to excuse us from, but set us an Example of, doing like|wise.

<P N="1">1. If the <HI>Errand</HI> Christ came into the World upon, was in Fact as this Author represents it, then it appears a just Inference, That both CHRIST himself &amp; his <HI>Apostles</HI> (not to mention the Prophets, who testified beforehand concerning it) must needs have been <HI>Impostors,</HI> either wilfully <HI>misrepre|senting</HI> the Case, or else greatly <HI>misunderstanding</HI> it.&mdash;For Christ saith of himself, Matth. 18&punc; 11. <HI>The Son of Man is come to save that which was lost.</HI>&mdash;Was it to save Souls from a lost perishing State in <HI>Sin?</HI> Or was it only to save
<PB N="86" REF="006902_0101_0F67255134F34C40">
Men from a blind <HI>Pagan</HI> State, from Heathen <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and to bring them into the Knowledge and Practice of <HI>Morality?</HI> According to our Author it must be the latter, and not the former, that's intended, as <HI>the End of Christ's coming.</HI> But certainly <HI>such a Thought</HI> wou'd be very <HI>absurd</HI> and <HI>blasphemous.</HI> And <HI>God forbid!</HI> that any such mean and vile Apprehension of the End of Christ's coming should enter into our Hearts. God&punc; forbid, that we should suppose, this was the only or the main End of it!&mdash;It was therefore to save Souls from Sin and Misery, that he came; as is before proved. And Christ testifies that he came to give <HI>his Life a Ransom for many,</HI> Matth. 20. 28. Which he needed not to have done, if it were only to <HI>settle a Scheme of Morality.</HI> But the Scriptures teach us better Things concerning the Redeemer of Souls. See 1 Joh. 3. 5. <HI>He was manifested to take away our Sins.</HI> So <HI>Chap.</HI> 4. 9, 10. &amp; 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 15.&mdash;And in this View the <HI>Baptist</HI> beheld Christ, when he said, <HI>Behold the Lamb of God!</HI> Joh. 1. 29.</P>
<P N="2">2. According to this Author's Representation of the End of Christ's coming, the <HI>Commission</HI> he gave to his <HI>Dis|ciples,</HI> and the <HI>Errand</HI> he sent them upon, was <HI>superior</HI> to <HI>his own;</HI> which would be an <HI>Absurdity</HI> to suppose, and <HI>Blasphemous</HI> in a high Degree.&mdash;Christ's Commission was <HI>prior</HI> and <HI>superior</HI> to that of his Disciples; and it was fore|to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d long before he appeared in his Humanity, <HI>Isai.</HI> 61. 1, 2, 3. Christ is there described as <HI>anointed of God,</HI> and <HI>sent, to preach good Tidings to the Meek, to bind up the bro|ken-hearted, to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and the open|ing of the Prison-Doors to them that are bound; to appoint unto them that mourn in</HI> Zion, <HI>to give unto them Beauty for Ashes,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;Agreeably to this his Commission he begins his <HI>Sermon in the Mount:</HI> Tho' our Author pretends it is made wholly up of <HI>moral Instruction,</HI> which does not reach to the <HI>binding up the broken-hearted,</HI> nor does <HI>Morality</HI> set at <HI>Liberty</HI> those that are led <HI>Captive</HI> by Sin &amp; Satan.&mdash;Christ himself notes, that in <HI>him</HI> was <HI>fulfilled</HI> the Prophet's Pre|diction, which was <HI>concerning him,</HI> Luk. 4. 18. And how
<PB N="87" REF="006902_0102_0F67264211901FD0">
aptly he proves it, and acts up to his Commission, is wor|thy of our Observation, even in the Beginning of his <HI>Ser|mon on the Mount.</HI> There we see, <HI>he binds up the broken|hearted, brings good Tidings to the Meek,</HI> supports the <HI>Poor in Spirit</HI> with the Promise of the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> and comforts them that are <HI>Mourners in Zion</HI> for their Sins, and <HI>opens the Prison-Doors to them that are bound,</HI> and sets the <HI>Captives</HI> under Satan's Power at <HI>Liberty,</HI> and promises the Benefit of his <HI>Righteousness</HI> to all that <HI>hunger and thirst</HI> af|ter it. Christ here, in <HI>Part,</HI> fulfills his Commission, by pro|nouncing a <HI>Blessing</HI> on all that sustain these distinguishing <HI>Characters,</HI> as we find <HI>Matth.</HI> 5. 3, 4, 5, 6.&mdash;We may further note it as a strong Proof and undeniable Evidence of his Mission and Commission from the Father, as the true Messiah and Redeemer of Souls, we find him saying in his Answer to <HI>John'</HI>s Messengers, <HI>Matth.</HI> 11. 5. and <HI>Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> 7. 22. <HI>The Blind see, the Lame walk, the Lepers are cleansed,</HI> &amp;c. Now, tho' these Things were actually done on the <HI>Bodies</HI> of Men, yet they had a <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>mystical</HI> Meaning, to prove Christ's Sufficiency and Power to mi|nister Healing to the <HI>Souls</HI> of all tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> came or should come to Him, by Faith in his Righteousness and mediatorial Fulness.&mdash;What I have here offered is to shew the high Commission Christ came into the World invested with, as the <HI>Mediator between God and Man;</HI> and how punctually he has fulfilled the Business of it on the Earth; not meerly by <HI>preaching up Morality,</HI> and <HI>setting up that refined Scheme of moral Vertue,</HI> as our Author suggests, but by establishing the more refined &amp; excellent Scheme of Man's Recovery from his fallen State in <HI>Adam,</HI> and from all his contracted Guilt and Misery by actual Transgression: for which, Christ has made sufficient Provision, in coming up fully to the Terms of his Commission, by answering both the <HI>preceptive</HI> and <HI>penal</HI> Demands of the <HI>Law.</HI>&mdash;And now, that Christ might still prosecute the Trust committed to him, tho' advanc'd to the heavenly Glory, he authorizes his Disciples on Earth to carry on the Work given them to do in subordination to him, and puts them under Com|mission,
<PB N="88" REF="006902_0103_0F67264256F1CF50">
as having <HI>all Power committed to him.</HI> Therefore says he to them, <HI>As my Father sent me, even so send I you.</HI> Joh. 20. 21.&mdash;And what they were commanded to do, we find by <HI>Matth.</HI> 10. 7, 8.&mdash;They were to <HI>preach the Gospel, to heal the Sick, cleanse the Lepers, raise the Dead, cast out Devils,</HI> &amp;c. A Work subservient to what Christ came upon, must be carried on by his Disciples, according to the extraordinary Measures of Grace, bestowed on them by Christ.&mdash;Indeed the Disciples preached up moral Du|ties, (yet under a Limitation, different from our Author) as we find in the <HI>Acts</HI> of the Apostles, and in their several <HI>Epistles;</HI> urging Christians to <HI>maintain good Works,</HI> in or|der to maintain their Christian Character, as having <HI>believed</HI> in God our Saviour, and thereby demonstrate the Sincerity of their Faith: whose pious Example in pressing moral Duties, hath been, is, and ever will be, followed by all Christ's faithful Embassadors, to the End of the World. But still, neither the Disciples, nor their Followers hinted at, ever presum'd to confine their Instructions to <HI>moral Vertue,</HI> or Duties of <HI>Morality.</HI> For <HI>to them was committed the Word of Reconciliation,</HI> by Christ; <HI>in whom</HI> God is said to be <HI>reconciling the World to himself,</HI> 2 Cor. 5. 19. They therefore preach'd <HI>the glad Tidings of Peace,</HI> and the gra|cious Terms of Reconciliation, namely, <HI>Repentance toward God and Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Acts 20. 21. Eminently they preach'd up <HI>Faith</HI> in the Incarnate Son of God, who for our Sake was <HI>obedient unto Death,</HI> who <HI>suf|fered for Sins, the Just for the Unjust,</HI> who was <HI>delivered for our Offences, and raised again for our Justification.</HI>&mdash;These are some of the essential <HI>Ends</HI> of Christ's coming into the World, which the primitive Preachers insisted on. Which shews, that Christ came for <HI>higher</HI> and <HI>more excel|lent Ends,</HI> than meerly to <Q>set up a Scheme of (even Chris|tian) <HI>Morality</HI> among Mankind.</Q> Whereas if our <HI>Au|thor'</HI>s Account of Christ's coming were true (as represented in his Discourse) then the Commission he gave to his <HI>Dis|ciples,</HI> must be <HI>superior</HI> even to his own; but the contrary has been proved. And I farther observe, that in Propor|tion,
<PB N="89" REF="006902_0104_0F672644380314B0">
as any deny or obscure the <HI>main Design</HI> of Christ's coming into the World, so far (I say) as this is done by any, it must appear equally <HI>blasphemous</HI> and <HI>absurd.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Aother Argument is,&mdash;That if Christ was born and came into the World only to <HI>settle the Scheme</HI> so highly applauded by our Author, then his Work is already <HI>finished,</HI> and he has Nothing further to act on Man's Behalf. For having once <HI>settled this Scheme,</HI> it seems according to our Author, Christ had Nothing more to do. But we have a <HI>more sure Word,</HI> than this Author's Credit will reach, in this Case. The Scriptures plainly tell us, <HI>The Man Christ Jesus</HI> is <HI>Mediator between God and Man;</HI> and as Media|tor he sustained a <HI>three-fold</HI> Office when on Earth, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the Office of a Prophet, and of a Priest, and of a King: which Offices he continues still, tho' in Heaven, to execute in the Earth, not personally, but by his Agents and In|struments. He still executes his <HI>pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">phetick</HI> Office; and this he does by his Spirit enlightening us, by his Word instructing us, and by his Ministers dispensing the Word and Ordinances.&mdash;Christ also still executes his <HI>Kingly</HI> Of|fice, in common Providence, in his Church, and in the Hearts of Believers. C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ist by his Kingly Power restrains (as he pleases) the Sons of Men, both Saints and Sinners, from the open as well as secret Wickedness they are natu|rally inclined to. He restrains by his Power the Perse|cutors of his Church and People: He makes <HI>the Wrath of Man to praise him, and the Remainder of Wrath he restrains.</HI> He subdues by his Power the Stubbornness of Men's Wills, and brings them into Subjection to his holy Law: and as he has <HI>led Captivity Captive,</HI> He rescues Souls from the <HI>Power of Satan,</HI> and <HI>translates</HI> them into <HI>his own Kingdom,</HI> the Church militant here below, by converting Grace, <HI>re|newing them in the Spirit of their Minds,</HI> sanctifying and fit|ing them for triumphal Glory; so that <HI>where he is,</HI> there all that are <HI>given to him</HI> by the Father, in the Covenant of redeeming Grace, shall be also in due Time, in Answer to his mediatory Prayer, <HI>Joh.</HI> 17. 24.&mdash;Thus we see, Christ had <HI>other</HI> and <HI>higher</HI> Motives in View, when he
<PB N="90" REF="006902_0105_0F672644E8A5E240">
came into the World, than to meerly <HI>settle a Scheme of Morality.</HI>&mdash;But then by Way of Eminency, we are to consider Christ as sustaining the Office of a <HI>Priest;</HI> wherein the Redemption of Sinners is in a more special and primary Manner concerned: And his <HI>Priesthood</HI> is an <HI>everlasting Priesthood.</HI> He has once offered up himself a lasting Sa|crifice, acceptable to God, for the Expiation of Sin. Therefore it is said, <HI>With his Stripes we are healed:</HI> And that, because the <HI>Chastisement of our Peace was upon him.</HI> Isai. 53. 5.&mdash;Agreable to which the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> remarks, that <HI>we have Redemption through his Blood, even the For|giveness of Sins.</HI> Eph. 1. 7.&mdash;The same Thing he repeats in <HI>Col.</HI> 1. 14.&mdash;See also <HI>Heb.</HI> 5. 7.&mdash;And the Apostle having proved the Insignificancy of <HI>legal</HI> Sacrifices, in Point of spiritual Purification, or to cleanse the Soul from Sin, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9 13. he proceeds, <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 14. to say, <HI>How much more shall the Blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without Spot to God, purge your Consciences from dead Works to serve the living God?</HI>&mdash;Christ is therefore said to be <HI>consecrated for evermore.</HI> Heb. 7. 28.&mdash;</P>
<P>Having thus hinted at some of the Ends and Designs of Christ's coming into the World, and what he did when here below, superiour to that of <HI>settling a Scheme of moral Virtue;</HI> I proceed to shew, That notwithstanding all that he did in establishing, as well as refining this <HI>Scheme,</HI> and what he has done in his higher and more excellent Acts relating to his glorifying God in the Work of <HI>Man'</HI>s <HI>Re|demption,</HI> which was the <HI>principal</HI> Thing aimed at in the Father's anointing and sending him, and Christ's volun|tarily engaging in the great and difficult Service of a Me|diator, his Work is not wholly done (as before has been noted with Regard to his Prophetick and Kingly Offices) but this of his <HI>Priestly</HI> Office he <HI>continues</HI> still in the Exer|cise and Execution of.&mdash;He is said to be <HI>our Fore-runner, entred into Heaven,</HI> (Heb. 6. 20.) to <HI>appear in the Presence of God for us.</HI> (Heb. 9. 24.)&mdash;And he appears before God as <HI>our Advocate.</HI> (1 Joh. 2. 1)&mdash;And this our blessed Ad|vocate with the Father is <HI>able also to save even to the utter|most
<PB N="91" REF="006902_0106_0F67264597E90090">
all that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make Intercession for them.</HI> (Heb. 7. 25.)&mdash;It plainly ap|pears then, from what has been said under this Head, that neither <HI>Moses,</HI> nor the <HI>Prophets,</HI> any of them, that testified before-hand of Christ's coming, nor <HI>Christ</HI> himself, nor his <HI>Apostles,</HI> are Vouchers for our Author: but unite in witnessing against his Sentiments, that the End of Christ's being born and coming into the World was to <HI>settle a Scheme of Morality,</HI> either exclusive or transcendent to all those wonderful <HI>Designs,</HI> I have refer'd to above, that ac|cording to the Scripture Christ came for and partly effect|ed when here on the Earth, and is now carrying on in Heaven, by Vertue of his mediatorial Authority, Suffici|ency, and boundless Grace.&mdash;Unhappy it is, that these great Things concerning Christ should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and as it seems, with Design, by our Author, to magni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ie <HI>moral Virtue,</HI> whatever becomes of the Essentials of Chris|tianity.&mdash;Now, what the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> awfully speaks concerning <HI>false Teachers,</HI> I am afraid is like to be the de|plorable State of poor <HI>New-England,</HI> and the Churches here, if the <HI>Errors</HI> advanced by some among us are suffer|ed to prevail. See 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2. <HI>There were false Pro|phets also among the People, even as there shall be false Teach|ers among you, who&mdash;shall bring in&mdash;Heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift Destruction. And many shall follow their pernicious Ways, by Reason of whom the Way of Truth shall be evil spoken of.</HI> Now they <HI>deny</HI> the Lord Jesus, who deny the Divinity of his Person, and his Satisfaction; and who deny any of the Fundamentals of the <HI>Doctrine of Christ;</HI> either the Doctrine which he <HI>himself</HI> taught in his personal Ministry, or which his <HI>Apostles</HI> by Commission from him, and under the Inspiration of his Spirit, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ght after his Ascen|sion. Such may well be ranked under the Character of <HI>them that are ashamed of Christ and of his Words,</HI> or that <HI>deny the Lord which bought us,</HI> who reject the <HI>Doctrine</HI> delivered by his <HI>Apostles</HI> in his Name, under whatever Pretence. Christ and his Apostles harmonized in their Doctrine:
<PB N="92" REF="006902_0107_0F6726461DC46450">
And the Apostles fully agreed among themselves. Hence they sometimes bore <HI>Testimony</HI> to one another's Doctrine. 2 Pet. 3. 15.&mdash;<HI>Even as our beloved Brother</HI> Paul <HI>also, ac|cording to the Wisdom given unto him, hath written unto you; as also in all his Epistles, speaking in them of these Things: in which are some Things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned &amp; unstable wrest, as they do also the other Scrip|tures, unto their own Destruction.</HI> Now, on this Text I ground an Argument, to prove the divine Authority of the Doctrine of <HI>Election,</HI> of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> of <HI>imputed Righteousness,</HI> and o|ther Doctrines contained in the Scriptures, particularly in <HI>Paul&punc;s</HI> Epistles, which protestant Expositors and Preachers in general have held, and for which this Author so strong|ly condemns them. The Argument for Proof of these Doc|trines which <HI>Paul</HI> preach'd, lies here. As <HI>Peter</HI> was one of Christ's Apostles, sent by a special and immediate Com|mission, and under the special Direction and Influence of the Holy Spirit, to preach the Gospel, to <HI>disciple all Na|tions, baptising them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all Things, whatsoever Christ had commanded them;</HI> hence in this Way of <HI>teaching</HI> and <HI>observing</HI> all Things which Christ had commanded, that Promise was his, <HI>Lo, I am with you alway, even to the End of the World.</HI> Matth. 28. 19, 20.&mdash;If <HI>Paul</HI> therefore, in any of his <HI>Epistle's,</HI> had delivered Doctrines contrary to the <HI>Mind of Christ,</HI> which <HI>Peter</HI> had a personal and very particular Knowledge of, it must be supposed he would in Faithfulness have corrected <HI>Paul'</HI>s Error in that Case. But <HI>Peter,</HI> we see, justifies and confirms those Doctrines <HI>Paul</HI> had delivered in his Epistles; yea, tho' <HI>some of them were hard to be understood,</HI> and so (like some of the Para|bles and Sayings of Christ) required a close Application of Mind to know then Meaning. On which we may note, That it is for Want of a mature and deliberate Conside|ration, and Inquiry into the Nature and Authority, as well as Grounds of <HI>these</HI> and some other Scripture-Doctrines, that some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Apostle's Words) <HI>who are unlearned and unstable, wre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> Paul's <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, even as they do also the
<PB N="93" REF="006902_0108_0F672646E3958EE0">
other Scriptures, unto their own Destruction.</HI>&mdash;If then, di|vine Inspiration and the Testimony of the Spirit, by which these Apostles spake, has any Weight with us, we must conclude, these Doctrines (however contested and ridicul'd by some at this Day) yet being taught in <HI>Paul'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Epistles, they are according to the <HI>Mind of Christ;</HI> and those that deny his Truths, however hard to be understood, I think, may justly be said to <HI>deny Christ,</HI> and may fear that <HI>he will deny them before his Father which is in Heaven,</HI> according to <HI>Matth.</HI> 10. 33.</P>
<P>But I have yet something farther to add on Christ's Be|half, and in Vindication, as of the Doctrines we are here treating of, so of those that <HI>profess them.</HI></P>
<P>It is worthy of our Observation, <HI>to whom</HI> the Apostle Peter writes his <HI>Epistles.</HI> The first of them he superscribes thus,&mdash;<HI>To the Strangers scattered throughout</HI> Pontus, &amp;c. ELECT <HI>according to the fore-knowledge of God the Father.</HI> His second Epistle is thus directed, <HI>To them that have ob|tained like precious Faith with us, through the Righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI> Those he wrote to, were <HI>Christians</HI> in the Apostle's Eye and Opinion, that had been instructed in the Doctrines which <HI>Peter,</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> and other Apostles preached, and had believed and pro|fessed the same. Now, if we compare these Characters of those he wrote to, with the Apostle's Words in 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 17. <HI>Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these Things before, be|ware lest ye also being led away with the Error of the Wicked, fall from your own Stedfastness:</HI> What other, or stronger Evidence do we need, to confirm our Faith in these <HI>Doc|trines,</HI> taught in <HI>Paul'</HI>s Epistles, and in other Parts of Scripture? It is plain, they whom the Apostle wrote to, had <HI>known</HI> these Doctrines, had been thoro'ly instructed in them, and were not Strangers to them: However he cau|tions them, in a Day of Temptation, to <HI>beware lest they being led away with the Error of the Wicked</HI> (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> whom he had before described <HI>the unlearned and unstable,</HI> i. e. Men that were <HI>willingly ignorant of these Things,</HI> and of <HI>an un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound Mind,</HI> who <HI>perverted the Scriptures,</HI> to invalidate the

Doctrines contained therein, and make them, if possible, serve to promote <HI>Error</HI>) <HI>fall from their own Stedfastness.</HI> It seems, they had been taught these, and other Gospel-Doc|trines, from their first Acquainta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ce with, and Profession of Christianity, and were in some Measure <HI>establish'd</HI> in them; yet, were not so out of all Danger by <HI>Seducers,</HI> but that they had need be upon their Guard.&mdash;It is beyond all Contradiction then, I presume, that the <HI>Apostles,</HI> in these and all other Points, harmonized with their Lord and Master <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> as by the Power and Influence of his Spirit, and in his Name and under his Authority, they spake, and delivered these Things to us. And we have the Testimony even of <HI>Devils,</HI> confirming it by one of their officious Agents, who followed <HI>Paul</HI> and the other Ministers that accompanied him, and who contrary to her own and her Master's Gains was constrained to cry out, and say, <HI>These Men are the Servants of the Most</HI> High God, <HI>which shew unto us the Way of Salvation.</HI> (Act. 16. 17.) Now, the Method they took in <HI>shewing Men the Way of Salvati|on,</HI> was, by <HI>preaching</HI> CHRIST, and the Doctrines he had directed them to preach; particularly, the Doctrine of a <HI>personal</HI> and <HI>eternal Election of Grace,</HI> the Doctrine of <HI>Ori|ginal Sin,</HI> of <HI>Redemption by the Blood of Christ,</HI> of <HI>Justifi|cation by Faith,</HI> of <HI>imputed Righteousness,</HI> of <HI>efficacious</HI> Grace, &amp;c. which have been considered in the foregoing Part of these Remarks. They also preached, <HI>both to the Jews and also to the Greeks, Repentance toward God, and Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> and testify'd to Believers the Necessity of a <HI>holy</HI> Practice, pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing on them the Duties of the Chris|tian Life, in a plain and powerful Manner.&mdash;It may be proper now to look a little into <HI>Paul'</HI>s Testimony concern|ing himself, and see what he says in his own Behalf, and in Respect of the Doctrines he had preach'd. He makes that solemn Asseveration (Act. 20. 20, 27.) <HI>I kept back nothing that was profitable to you&mdash;For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the Counsel of God.</HI>&mdash;Now if these Doctrines I have treated of, are not really a Part of <HI>God's Counsel,</HI> or are not truly <HI>profitable</HI> to Men, <HI>Paul,</HI> and the other Apostles and
<PB N="95" REF="006902_0110_0F6726486FA61308">
Preachers of the Gospel, in the Infant-State of Christianity, must be deemed great <HI>Impostors,</HI> and designing to deceive the World to a monstrous Degree. But, how horrid is this for any to imagine! Tho' perhaps there be some of <HI>Paul's</HI> Directors among us, and Pretenders to correct the Scrip|tures, who may think it high Time to blot some Texts out of the <HI>Bible,</HI> as they have declared for erasing these Doctrines out of our excellent <HI>Assembly's Catechism.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>I hope, the candid Reader will excuse this long Excur|sion, occasioned by a <HI>Pamphlet'</HI>s coming to my Hand as I was transcribing my Papers, intitled, "A <HI>Narrative</HI> of an unhappy Contention in the Church at <HI>Ashford</HI> in <HI>Connec|ticut,</HI> &amp;c. published by their <HI>late Pastor:</HI>" In which are sundry gross <HI>Arminian</HI> Errors, or worse, as I apprehend, calculated to <HI>destroy the Faith,</HI> and subvert the Religion professed in these Churches. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Gentleman refer'd to above, is Mr. <HI>John Bass,</HI> late Minister of <HI>Ashford,</HI> who was discharged from his Pastoral Office there, the Rea|sons whereof we have given us by himself, in his <HI>Narrative.</HI>&mdash;name|ly, His <HI>changing his Sentiments</HI> concerning several <HI>Doctrines,</HI> profe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t in this Land, from the first Settlement of Christianity here, and plainly revealed in Scripture, according to the united Judgment of that ve|nerable <HI>Consociation</HI> that dismissed him.&mdash;As he informs us in the Be|ginning of his <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> at his Settlement (Anno 1743.) he <HI>professed himself to be of the</HI> Calvinian <HI>Class, and as such remained for several Years, yet all that Time suspected of</HI> Arminianism, &amp;c. And upon it he says <Q><HI>Calvinistick</HI> Principles I then found to be at this Day a <HI>Clergy|man's</HI> main Defence, the best he can hit upon to provide him <HI>Food</HI> and <HI>Raiment,</HI> and to fix him in the good Graces of the Populace: <HI>Interest</HI> set this Way.</Q>&mdash;Truly it gives just Ground of Suspicion, that this Gentleman made a Profession of the <HI>Calvinistic</HI> Doctrine, at his Settlement, and for some Time after, from those <HI>mercenary Views</HI> he speaks of.</P>
<P>It does not appear but that those <HI>zealous and critical Hearers</HI> he speaks of, were Persons of Integrity, as well as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound in the Faith,</HI> and <HI>orthodox in their Principles;</HI> and doubtless they found their Minister to be of a <HI>temporizing</HI> Disposition and Conduct.&mdash;They are highly to be com|mended, for their Care to suppress Error, and to maintain <HI>the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</HI> which all that profess Christianity should <HI>contend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for,</HI> and not to <HI>be carried about with every Wind of Doc|trine,</HI> as too many are at this Day apt to be captivated and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nared by&punc;&mdash;But, these <HI>Hearers</HI> of his, it seems, were too <HI>critical</HI> and judi|cious, as well as <HI>zealous</HI> for the Truth, to be drawn to <HI>deny the Faith</HI> they had received and professed&punc; and with their Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">or to run into <HI>Error;</HI> notwithstanding all his Artifices to hold his Station and act under Disguise, as he had done in Years past, by his own Confession, and as is reported, covertly, to betray that People into the like <HI>Arminian</HI> Delusions with himself.</P>
<P>Now that he has fallen from, and denies some of the most important Doctrines, contained &amp; taught in the Gospel, is evident.&mdash;He begins (<HI>Pag.</HI> 13.) with that of <HI>Original Sin.</HI>&mdash;But as I have insisted on this Topick, in the foregoing Remarks, I refer the Reader to what is there offered in Vindication of this <HI>Doctrine,</HI>&mdash;and shall here only observe, that this Gentleman appears to me <HI>inconsistent</HI> with himself. For he says, <HI>Pag.</HI> 14. <Q>God in his Wisdom and Righteousness saw fit, not only to turn them [i. e. <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI>] out of the Garden of <HI>Eden</HI>&mdash;but also to sentence them to a State of weari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">om Labour, abun|dant Sorrow and Temptation, and after this, to return to the Ground, from whence they were taken: This was to them a Punishment of their Sin; but the Effects of it did not terminate here; for I find that God took Occasion <HI>for this Sin</HI> to lay the <HI>same Sentence</HI> upon all their Posterity.</Q>&mdash;On which I argue thus,</P>
<P>It is certain, that God who is the <HI>Judge of all the Earth,</HI> must and will <HI>do Right:</HI> But can it be possible in Reason, or consistent with Scrip|ture, to suppose, that the <HI>same Sentence,</HI> pronounced on <HI>Adam,</HI> should descend to his <HI>Posterity,</HI> if he had not stood as their <HI>common Head</HI> and <HI>Representative</HI> in that first Covenant God made with him? Or how could his Offspring share with him in the <HI>Penalties</HI> of his Sin (as is owned by this Author) if there were not the Communication of <HI>Sin</HI> from him, and <HI>Guilt</HI> lying on them?&mdash;It therefore appears to me, that by his Concessions here, he has given up the Point in Debate, notwithstanding the Arguments he produces to the contrary; and by necessary Consequence owns the Doctrine of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> which he would be thought to deny.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Narrative</HI> the Author denies the Doctrine of <HI>Election,</HI> of which I have also briefly treated in the foregoing Remarks; therefore shall only add here, that to deny the Doctrine of <HI>Election,</HI> does manifestly impeach the <HI>In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inity, absolute Sovereignty,</HI> and <HI>Unchangeableness of</HI> GOD.&mdash;<HI>with whom is no variableness, neither Shadow of turning.&mdash;He is in one Mind, and who can turn him? He performeth the Thing that is appoint|ed</HI> (or that he has appointed) <HI>for me.</HI>&mdash;In a Word, it is to assume God's Prerogative, and a placing Man in God's Stead, in the Matter of our Salvation:&mdash;Which leads to make Man the Author of his own Salvation, and not God.&mdash;The Doctrine also of the special <HI>Re|demption</HI> by Christ, of those <HI>given him by the Father,</HI> this Author denies: And insinuate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Doctrine of <HI>universal Redemption;</HI> to prove which he offers some Scriptures, that appear to me very wrongly applied, and among others brings those Words of our Saviour, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. 16.And by this he manifestly intends, that the <HI>Belief</HI> or <HI>Faith</HI> Christ there speaks of, is in Man's own Power, and so the Agency of the <HI>Holy Spi|rit</HI> in a Way of special Grace is superseded.&mdash;Therefore under his fourth Head <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or <HI>Regeneration,</HI> he tells us, this <Q>includes an in|genuous Sorrow, excited by a View of the Love of God and Jesus Christ.</Q>&mdash;A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>ingenuous Sorrow!</HI> So that according to him, Man's <HI>Regeneration</HI> or Conversion depends on his own <HI>ingenuous</HI> Disposition, or his being of a pliable Temper, easily drawn, and by some happy Gift of Nature led to contemplate or <HI>view the Love of God and Jesus Christ.</HI> But this is not according to the Description the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> gives us, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 10. where it is termed a <HI>Godly</HI> (and not me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rly an <HI>ingenuous</HI>) <HI>Sorrow,</HI> that leads to and issues in evangelical Repentance, a <HI>Repentance, not to be repented of;</HI> which Repentance is <HI>to Salvation.</HI> And if <HI>not to be repent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d of,</HI> it must finally issue in eternal <HI>Salvation;</HI> which proves the true Christian's <HI>Perseverance</HI> in Grace. This is also denied by the Author of the <HI>Narrative</HI> under our Consideration here; and consequently the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ngenuous Sorrow</HI> he speaks of, according to any consistent Sense, can mean no other than a meer <HI>legal</HI> Sorrow, or <HI>the Sorrow of the World, which works D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ath:</HI> it being meerly natural, and not of supernatural Grace.&mdash;But if <Q>Holiness [as he speaks, <HI>Pag.</HI> 20.] is the Effect of a divine Operation upon the Mind,</Q> Then <HI>Repe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|tance</HI> must be of the same Original, as one of the first Fruits of Holi|ness, wrought in us by <HI>the Operation of God,</HI>&mdash;a supernatural, tran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|cendant Work of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> in all the Parts of it.&mdash;What be|comes then of his <HI>ingenuous Sorrow?</HI>&mdash;It shews us indeed, how fond some Persons are of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> and <HI>ambiguous</HI> Phrases, to amuse the World, and mask their Errors, under plausible Appearances&punc; by a double meaning in their Manner of expressing Things of a religious Nature. From whence we may gather, that altho' in this <HI>Narrative</HI> the Author has produced some particular Texts of <HI>Scripture</HI> to support his Errors, however wrongly applied, yet his main Dependance is on Mr. <HI>Taylor's</HI> Sentiments, to whom be often refers his Readers for a full Decision of the Points in Deba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e: When it is well known, that the <HI>Principles</HI> that Writer has espoused have been condemned as erroneous and con|trary to Scripture-Doctrine, by the Consent of <HI>Protestants</HI> in general: Besure by all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and more judicious Part of them, from the Beginning of the Reformation; therefore to be justly suspected as of a poisonous Nature, destructive to vital Religion. And it is much to be lam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nted, that any should be found among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in these Churche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>New-England,</HI> and in the Ministry, levened with such a Spirit of Opposition to the <HI>Truth as it is in Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>I shall only add, in my Remarks on this <HI>Narrative,</HI> That the <HI>Consociation</HI> which acted in Mr. <HI>Bass's</HI> Dismission, are represented by him, as pro|ceeding in an arbitrary Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er toward him and some of the People of <HI>Ashford,</HI> tenacious of the like Errors, and which probably he had, by his Insinuations, drawn them <HI>ignorantly</HI> into. The pretended Com|plaint is, The super<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eding of a <HI>Vote</HI> previously passed in that Church, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That in Case of Difficulty arising, the Matter should be decided by a <HI>Council</HI> mutually chosen by them; or to that Purpose.&mdash;Which Mr.<HI>Bass</HI> appears by his Account to have insisted on; but was denied.&mdash;For which, I think, there was good Reason.</P>
<P>A <HI>Council</HI> mutually chosen must have each of the contending Parties Consent; which, as he relates the Case, cou'dn't be obtained then.</P>
<P>And farther I suppose, Mr. <HI>Bass</HI> was not ignorant, that the Legislative Power in <HI>Connecticut</HI> Government, had long since passed a Law, that all Matters of the same Kind, in Churches, that cou'd not be decided and healed within themselves, should be determined by a <HI>Consociation</HI> of Elders and Messengers of Churches, within the Limits of that <HI>County,</HI> where such Difference was subsisting.&mdash;These Gentlemen then acted a wise and laudable Part, agreable to their own Constitution. But to this Method of Procedure Mr. <HI>Bass</HI> objects, and labours to evade, it's likely, to obtain a <HI>pick'd</HI> Number of Elders to favour his Cause, and continue him to act with the like Disguise, as in Years pst he had done.</P>
<P>With Regard to the Procedure of that venerable Consociation, so much complain'd of in this Narrative, I shall take the Liberty to say; It is to me a hopeful Omen, That God has Mercy in Reserve for these Churches, and will, it's hoped, appear to defend them against the Growth of <HI>Arminian</HI> and other corrupt Opinions, and establish them in the Doctrines of the Gospel; when we find such a Number of Rev. Ministers, with their Delegates, united in their Result, (<HI>nemine con|tradicente</HI>) determined, from the Soundness of their Faith&punc; and well grounded scriptural Principles, to appear for the Truth, and suppress Error, and as Instruments [we trust] in God's Hand to rescue that poor People of <HI>Ashford,</HI> from the Ruin impending over them, with a threatning Aspect on their Children after them,&mdash;and also to con|vince their Pastor, if possible, and recover him from the Errors he had unhappily fallen into. I pray God to strengthen their Hands in the Cause of Christ, and stir up others, that they may also appear for the <HI>Defence of the Gospel,</HI> and make a vigorous Stand against the growing Corruptions of the present Day, both in Doctrine and Manners.&mdash;</P>
<P>What I have offered by Way of Remark on some Passages of this <HI>Nar|rative&punc;</HI> does not proceed from a Disaffection to the Author's Person,&mdash;but from an awful Apprehension of the sinking State of these Churches, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f the Sentiments this Gentleman his exhibited to the World, should be suffered in Providence to prevail. Which God in Mercy prevent!</P></NOTE></P>

<P>I come now to the last general Head of Remarks pro|posed, which was,</P>
<P N="5">V. To resolve these two Inquiries; (1.) <HI>Whether our Author's reproachful</HI> Description <HI>of the</HI> Religion of Prote|stants <HI>opposed by him,</HI> (particularly as expressed in the 7<HI>th <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd</HI> 8<HI>th Pages</HI> of his Discourse) <HI>be not fairly applicable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to</HI> his own <HI>Religion, so far as we have it exhibited in
<PB N="100" REF="006902_0115_0F67264C2E7DB7D8">
this his Discourse?</HI>&mdash;And then (2.) <HI>Whether the</HI> Objec|tions <HI>which he has framed and pretended to Answer, in Re|lation to his</HI> Discourse (at the Close of it) <HI>do not really stand good, and contain a true &amp; just Description of it, in it's Nature, and Tendency, notwithstanding his laboured Solutions?</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The first Inquiry is, <HI>Whether the Author's Invectives, or the reproachful Description he has given of the Religion of</HI> Protestants <HI>opposed by him, in his Discourse</HI> (<HI>particularly his Reflections</HI> in Pag. 7th &amp; 8th) <HI>be not fairly applicable rather to the Religion pleaded for and recommended by himself in this his Discourse?</HI></P>
<P>He represents the <HI>pure and perfect Religion of</HI> JESUS, as by Means of the Principles which he opposes, <Q><HI>turn'd in many Places into an idle Speculation, a mysterious Faith, a senseless Superstition, and a groundless Recumbency.</HI></Q> Now the Question is, Whether these dark Characters do not more properly belong to the <HI>Religion</HI> our <HI>Author</HI> pleads for, than that he inveighs against? And I shall freely offer my Sentiments on this Point, however disagreable they may be to him, or others: Not with a Design to preju|dice the Minds of any against his Person, or injure his Name, but to convince him (if possible) of the pernicious Tendency of his Discourse, and to warn others against the dangerous Tenets he there espouses and urges.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) As to <HI>idle Speculation,</HI> his Discourse seems evidently to abound with it. For such, it plainly appears (I think)the darling Sentiments of this Author are, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That the <HI>grand Design</HI> of Christ's coming into the World was only to <HI>set up the Christian Scheme;</HI> and that this in <HI>Sum</HI> and <HI>Substance</HI> is but a more <HI>refined System of Morality,</HI> enforced by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">me peculiar <HI>Motives:</HI> nor is his Pretence, that <Q>our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Happiness is suspended on <HI>moral Virtue,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> good Behaviour,</Q> any other than a meer <HI>idle Speculation&punc;</HI> If we receive these Principles of his, our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for <HI>Justification</HI> in the Sight of God must be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Righteousness which is of God by Faith,</HI> but o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which is of the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w.</HI> Whereas divine Revelation assures us, that <HI>Christ is become of none <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> unto you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> of you are <PB N="101" REF="006902_0116_0F67264CDEEE22F8">

What then must these Pretences of this <HI>Author</HI> be, more than <HI>idle Speculations?</HI> The main Principles he holds and advances in his Dis|course, appear to me at best but <HI>idle</HI> Theory, speculative <HI>Absurdity,</HI> without any solid Foundation in "Scripture, or Reason, or even common Sense."&mdash;And,</P>
<P N="2">2. As to <HI>mysterious Faith,</HI> which our Author adds to his <HI>idle Speculation,</HI> how aptly (tho' perhaps inadvertently) hath he given us a further Description of his <HI>own</HI> Religi|on? Delineating to the Life, what that is by his own Confession and publick Declaration, That <Q>to set up the Christian <HI>Scheme,</HI> the most refined System of <HI>moral Ver|tue</HI> that ever the World was blessed with, was the <HI>grand Design</HI> of CHRIST'S coming into the World;</Q> and that this <HI>moral Vertue</HI> is the "<HI>Basis,</HI> and <HI>whole Superstructure</HI> of the Christian Religion"; and that "the <HI>whole</HI> of Man's Happiness is suspended on his <HI>personal</HI> good Behaviour"; and that "this is the Condition of <HI>all</HI> God's Favours to us," &amp;c. Consequently, that our whole Happiness is with|in the Compass of our own Power; which must imply a mighty Opinion of our <HI>Self-Sufficiency,</HI> and the certain Va|lidity of <HI>Self-Righteousness.</HI> To believe all which, is to believe Things in their own Nature <HI>incredible,</HI> contradic|tory to the general Current of Revelation, and repugnant even to the Dictates of enlighten'd Reason and Conscience: therefore it may justly be called a <HI>mysterious Faith</HI> indeed. But surely this is not <HI>according to the Faith of God's Elect,</HI> and an <HI>acknowledging the Truth which is after Godliness, in Hope of eternal Life, which God that cannot lie, promised before the World began.</HI> (Tit. 1. 1, 2.)

that Length already) of <HI>denying the Lord that purchased his Church with his own Blood,</HI> of renouncing the Doctrine of the ever blessed TRINITY, and exploding what is <HI>without Controversy the great Mystery of Godliness, God manifest in the Flesh.</HI>&mdash;The Faith that this Author professes, in the Discourse before us, is not that Faith which the Apostles preached, lived by, and kept unto the Death. (See <HI>Gal.</HI> 1. 23. &amp; 2. 16,&mdash;20. &amp; 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 7) The Apostle declares he had <HI>kept the Faith,</HI> the same Faith he had preached, respecting the fundamental Doctrines of Christianity, as set forth in his Epistles: and the same Faith has been re|ceived and kept, in general, also by <HI>Protestant</HI> Expositors and Preachers of the Gospel. But the Faith of our Au|thor is a <HI>mysterious Faith,</HI> truly; not founded in right Rea|son, nor taught in the Scriptures, which is the Rule and Standard of Faith, "teaching what Man is to believe concerning God, and what Duty God requires of Man."</P>
<P>This Author's Faith may rather be traced by turning our Eye to the <HI>Romish</HI> Church; where it may be found without much Difficulty, I apprehend, if it be not the very Essence of the <HI>Romish</HI> Faith, lying at the Bottom of that <HI>Mystery of Iniquity,</HI> which now is and for a long Time hath been working in the World. It certainly bears so near a Resemblance to it, that it is hard to distinguish them one from the other, or to say wherein there appears any im|portant Difference.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romish</HI> Church leads all in her Communion off from the <HI>Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> from his Merits and Satisfaction, and from the supernatural Energy of his Spirit. Tho' they speak of his <HI>Merits</HI> (as do's our Au|thor also) yet they look to their own <HI>Works,</HI> their <HI>moral Agency,</HI> and place their Dependance on their <HI>personal good Behaviour,</HI> with him, or rather he with them. They say, as he does, that personal good Behaviour is that on which is suspended the whole of our Happiness: but to say, as he doth, that <HI>Revelation</HI> or the Scripture every where thus suspends it, is to raise a false Report of the Scripture, in my Opinion; and they that do so, are in Danger of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="103" REF="006902_0118_0F67264E690115E8">
it to their own Destruction.</HI> And tho' he occasionally speaks of our <HI>Forgiveness</HI> and <HI>Acceptance through the Merits of Christ,</HI> so do they of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church, while yet they build all upon Works. Our Author indeed once mentions <HI>Faith</HI> &amp; <HI>Repentance,</HI> but they are bro't in as it were acciden|tally, and spoken of by the by, seemingly with an indifferent Air, as if these were Things comparatively but of little Moment; and he lays the <HI>chief Stress</HI> on <HI>moral Vertue.</HI> Just so do the <HI>Papists.</HI> They glory in their Ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tinences, Pilgrimages, and Visits to the Shrines of their canonized Saints: and to atone for former Sins, and obtain Favour with God, they have their Works of Supererogation, which they depend on as meritorious. What can our Author's "<HI>whole Happiness suspended on his personal good Behaviour,</HI>" or "<HI>good Living</HI>" (another of his Phrases) intend less than what I have mentioned concerning the <HI>Papists</HI> Depen|dance on their own Merits, or their good Works? What do his Words imply, but that a <HI>good Life</HI> is the <HI>antecedent</HI> Condition of <HI>Forgiveness,</HI> and that we are <HI>justified</HI> by <HI>Works of Righteousness which we have done?</HI> or what is it better, than to believe with the <HI>Papists,</HI> that CHRIST has merited that <HI>we</HI> may merit? <HI>Mysterious Faith</HI> indeed!</P>
<P>I would lead this Author to a further Parallel of his <HI>mysterious Faith,</HI> founded on <HI>moral Vertue,</HI> or Duties of Morality, in the received Sentiments of the Savage and Unciviliz'd <HI>Heathen,</HI> and the Dependance they have on <HI>moral Vertue.</HI> Generally they have a <HI>Faith</HI> (such as it is) of some superintendent Deity, and of a future State, where every one shall be happy or miserable, according to their <HI>personal good</HI> or <HI>ill Behaviour</HI> here,&mdash;i. e. according to the Rules of Morality among them. Such as have lived mo|rally, are (as they imagine) at Death to go to the <HI>South|ward,</HI> and enjoy much Pleasure in a warm Climate and temperate Air: but such as have been corrupt &amp; immoral in Life according to them, they assign to the <HI>Northern</HI> and frigid Parts of the World, to be afflicted with Cold. So that their Hopes for Futurity are built on <HI>moral Vertue;</HI> on which this Author also places such a Dependance.</P>

<P N="3">3. Another Article of Charge, which this Author brings against Orthodox Expositors, and Preachers, who hold the <HI>commonly received</HI> Opinions in Divinity, is, that by their Means "<HI>the Religion of</HI> JESUS is in many Places turned into a <HI>senseless Superstition.</HI>" Which must, I think, refer either to their Doctrine of <HI>Conviction, Terror,</HI> and <HI>Humiliation,</HI> preparatory to closing with Christ by Faith; or to the laudable Practice among us, of keeping Days of <HI>Fasting and Prayer,</HI> as well as publick <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> (if intended in this View, it must reflect on publick Authority prima|rily, for those Appointments) or to the Churches being scru|pulous of admitting <HI>human Inventions</HI> into the <HI>Worship</HI> of God; or else to our coming to God <HI>in the Name of the Mediator,</HI> depending on <HI>his Righteousness,</HI> and not on our own <HI>moral Vertue,</HI> or <HI>personal Righteousness,</HI> for Accep|tance&punc; with God, and obtaining his Favour; or lastly, to our being unwilling to make <HI>Morality</HI> the whole Sum and Substance of <HI>Christianity.</HI> And taken with this Reference, it may intend, that whatsoever any pretend to in Religion more than only <HI>moral Vertue,</HI> or any Thing beyond a <HI>Righ|teousness of their own,</HI> is but a <HI>senseless Superstition:</HI> And this is truly according to his own declared Sentiment, by representing <HI>moral Vertue</HI> (to use his own Phrase) as the very "<HI>Basi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &amp; whole Superstructure</HI> of Religion." But if so, then indeed there needs much less Spirituality in Worship, and in the Hearts and Lives of Christians: Then there is no Need of Regeneration, no Need of Faith in the Blood of Christ, no Need of Humiliation and Soul-Compunction for indwelling Sin,&amp;c.

But this is disclaimed by those that this Reproach is designed against (by the Author of it) who are careful to profess nothing as Matter of Faith, but what God has revealed, and nothing as Acts of Reli|gion and the Worship of God, but what he has appointed in his Word.&mdash;But then, what shall be said of them that are unsound in the Faith, to that Degree, as to <HI>teach for Doc|trine</HI> the vainImaginations of their own dark and becloud|ed Reason; and who act under the Influence perhaps of a corrupted Judgment and misguided Conscience?

<P N="4">4.

from what he calls "The pure and perfect Religion of JESUS," <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> a refin'd System of <HI>Morality.</HI>&mdash;For any Man to place his <HI>Hope of Happiness</HI> on that which comes with|in the Reach of his own natural Ability, with the Aid of common Grace, as <HI>personal good Behaviour</HI> does, this is un|doubtedly <HI>a groundless Recumbency;</HI> it will prove as <HI>a bro|ken Staff</HI> to him that lean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> on it, or as a <HI>Foot out of Joint.</HI> That Word of the Apostle to the <HI>Colossians,</HI> CHRIST <HI>in you the Hope of Glory,</HI> is sufficient to shew the falseness of the unregenerate Moralist's Hope; this is built on the <HI>Sand;</HI> it has no sure Foundation for it's Support, neither in Scrip|ture nor right Reason. Nothing short of the <HI>Righteous|ness which is of God,</HI> wrought out by Christ, and made our's by a gracious Imputation and a believing Accep|tance, is a sufficient Ground of <HI>Justification of Life,</HI> or a proper Object of our <HI>Confidence</HI> and Reliance. It is but a vain <HI>Confidence in the Flesh,</HI> that depends on meer <HI>moral Vertue,</HI> and not on the <HI>Righteousness of Faith</HI></P>
<P>Thus, I think, it plainly appears, that the <HI>idle Specula|tion,</HI> the <HI>mysterious Faith,</HI> the <HI>senseless Superstition,</HI> and the <HI>groundless Recumbancy,</HI> which this Author charges on o|thers, do all lie on himself: And the whole serves to shew of what Make his Religion is, together with all others who profess <HI>moral Vertue</HI> to be the <HI>Sum</HI> and <HI>Substance</HI> of <HI>Christianity,</HI> the <HI>Basis</HI> and <HI>whole Superstructure</HI> of the Reli|gion of JESUS; and accordingly suppose <HI>the whole of their Happiness to be suspended on their personal good Behaviour.</HI></P>
<P>Now, is it not beyond all Account strange, and indeed Matter of Amazement, that one under the Character of a <HI>Minister</HI> and but in his <HI>Youth,</HI> should give himself the Li|berty thus to revile and vilify our Religion, so firmly founded on Scripture, and the many Thousand excellently pious Professors of it? And to enforce his Reproaches, should espouse the Language of the most inveterate Haters of every Thing that is Religious, or that carries the Ap|pearance of it!

<P>When we reflect on the Generations past, and take an impartial View of the many eminent <HI>Reformers</HI> Abroad, and of the many <HI>Ministers of Jesus Christ</HI> in this Land, who were faithful and unwearied in their Day, to build up his Kingdom, and establish Truth &amp; Holiness in the Churches, not by <HI>Tradition from the Fathers,</HI> but from the unerring <HI>Oracles of God,</HI> and we trust, under the Direction and some good Degrees of the Influence of the <HI>Holy Spirit;</HI> Whose <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Example</HI> of Life loudly testified for them; I think this a sufficient Testimony for them in the Consci|ences of their Posterity, which should constrain us to ac|knowledge. <HI>That God was with them of a very Truth.</HI>&mdash;But alas! what a gloomy and dismal Scene now appears on the Stage, <HI>Tragical</HI> indeed to behold!

<P>I come now to consider,</P>
<P N="2">2. The second <HI>Inquiry</HI> proposed, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Whether the true <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Tendency</HI> of this Author's <HI>Discourse</HI> is not fairly represented in the <HI>Objections,</HI> which he himself has raised and pretended to answer, in the Conclusion of it? And so, whether these <HI>Objections</HI> don't abide in full <HI>Force</HI> against it, notwithstanding all his laboured Solutions, and pre|tended Vindications of himself?</P>
<P N="1">1. He says, <HI>Pag.</HI> 28.&mdash;<Q>I expect by this Time, some are ready to break forth,&mdash;<HI>Ah! all this directly tends to build People up in their own Righteousness.</HI></Q>&mdash;Truly our Author appears a Man of some <HI>Fore-sight,</HI> and to have a Talent at Conjecture. For surely his Performance has very plainly <HI>that,</HI> and no other Aspect; and every well principle'd and experienc'd Christian would naturally be led to make such a Judgment upon it. <HI>He that runs may read</HI> this to be the Scope and Drift <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, from Beginning to End. And what is the Author's <HI>Reply?</HI> a meer <HI>Evasion&punc;</HI> He beats the Air, and raises a Dust, to blind the Eyes of unwary Readers, and amuse the more Intelligent: While yet, if the Case be duly weighed, his Answer serves not to remove the Objection, but rather confirms and strength|ens it. For he acknowledges, <Q>If by his Discourse's building People up in <HI>their own Righteousness</HI> be meant, that it recommends Hypocrisy and counterfeit Vertue, that it places Religion in any external Duties, separate from a corresponding good Temper within, or in short, in any <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our own contriving &amp; not taught of God, or in any Thing but what the Bible makes the Substance of our present Duty and the Condition of our future Happiness; if this be the Force of the <HI>Objection,</HI></Q> He tells us, he <Q>has <HI>no other Answer to make,</HI> but to leave every one to judge for himself, how groundless it is.</Q>&mdash;Now, if this be all the Answer he has to make, in Defence of his Discourse, truly I think it but a meer <HI>Trifling</HI> in a Matter of such Moment; and that the

Charge in the <HI>Objection</HI> is no Ways removed, but fixed and corroborated by this his Reply.

Yet to pretend, as our Author doth; that it is the <HI>Basis</HI> and whole <HI>Superstructure</HI> of Religion, is but a windy and vain Imagination. For certainly where there is no true <HI>Contri|tion</HI> of Heart for Sin, nor unfeigned <HI>Faith</HI> in the Blood of of Christ, and consequently no <HI>Love</HI> in Sincerity towards God or Man, how can these at best be any Thing better than <HI>unregenerate Morality,</HI> or (in our Author's Phrase) <HI>Counterfeit Vertue?</HI> And while Men attend the Externals of divine Worship, how can there possibly be a <HI>correspond|ing good Temper within,</HI> without humble <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Media|tor,</HI> teaching them to <HI>do all in</HI> HIS <HI>Name,</HI> with intire Depen|dance on his <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Strength?</HI> But how can there be this Faith in <HI>Christ,</HI> where Men only depend on their <HI>moral Agency</HI> under the Aids of meer common Grace, and trust to <HI>their own Righteousness</HI> for Acceptance with God? Alas, what spiritual <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Vanity</HI> is it in any, to imagine that by their own Sufficiency they are able to do all required of them, both toward God and toward their fellow Creatures, and to trust in their <HI>personal good Beha|viour,</HI> to <HI>recommend</HI> them to the divine Mercy!&mdash;Yet af|ter all, what can we conceive of this Author's <HI>corres|ponding good Temper within,</HI> but that it means somewhat carrying a Correspondence with (or perhaps the very same Thing with) what others depend much on, under the Name

of <HI>The Light within,</HI> and <HI>moral Honesty,</HI> even so as to re|nounce <HI>Scripture-Revelation,</HI> especially in the <HI>Letter</HI> of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s of a <HI>killing</HI> and destructive Quality?&mdash;. And this looks the more likely, as such are Enemies to the Doctrine of <HI>Ori|ginal Sin,</HI> and of <HI>imputed Righteousness,</HI> and disown even Christ's Satisfaction or Atonement: And in this Regard shew a <HI>Temper within corresponding</HI> with that shewn in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut <HI>Author's</HI> Discourse.</P>
<P>In the Conclusion of his Answer to the present <HI>Objec|tion,</HI> he do's but still confirm it, while he owns <Q>his <HI>Rejoyc|ing in the least Tendency</HI> his Discourse has, to <HI>build People up in their own Righteousness, if by this be designed, it is any Ways calculated to encourage personal Goodness, and promote the Practice of moral and Christian Vertue in the World.</HI></Q> Which is to be understood, according to the Run of his whole Performance, as intending only the Prac|tice of the Duties of <HI>Morality,</HI> without justifying <HI>Faith</HI> and a <HI>regenerating</HI> Change on the Heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and how dan|gerous it is to rest in this, every one may easily judge.</P>
<P>We find him indeed confessing <Q>his <HI>greatest Concern,</HI> up|on a Review of his Discourse, That <HI>so good a Design I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> so poorly served.</HI></Q>&mdash;For this, I think truly he had just Reason, since it so evidently disowns those peculiar <HI>Doc|trines</HI> of the Gospel, which under the Influence of the Spi|rit of Grace, have the most powerful Efficacy to promote genuine <HI>Christian Vertue;</HI> and since it rather explodes, than recommends that <HI>Faith</HI> in CHRIST, which is the grand Principle of true and acceptable Obedience. For, where he once speaks of <Q>Reliance on the Merit &amp; Intercession of Christ,</Q> 'tis not in Language of Recommendation, but rather with Marks of <HI>Depreciation,</HI> and a visible Air of Contempt.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another <HI>Objection</HI> which he mentions and pretends to Answer (Pag. 29.) is this.&mdash;<Q><HI>Not one Word of Christ, nor the least Savour of true Gospel Soul saving Preaching in all this Discourse.</HI></Q>&mdash;Upon which I must observe, 'tis lamentable, that one who sustains the Character of a Mi|nister of <HI>Christ,</HI> and a Preacher of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and pretends

<P>It may be readily granted, as to the first Part of the <HI>Objection,</HI> he might have done himself the Justice, to reply, that he had spoken more than <HI>one Word</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> in his Discourse; that he had <HI>named</HI> him, and that he had talked of him: But then it's proper to inquire, after what <HI>Man|ner</HI> and to what <HI>Purpose</HI> he has done this? To which it can only be answered, that he has <HI>named</HI> him indeed, but under a comparatively diminutive Character, as the great <HI>Preacher</HI> of Righteousness, who came to set up the Chris|an <HI>Scheme</HI> in the World, and by his Doctrine and Example to propagate Truth and Vertue.&mdash;But then not a single Word of CHRIST, as the great <HI>High-Priest</HI> of our Pro|fession; not one Word of CHRIST, as the <HI>Propitiation</HI> for our Sins; not a Word of CHRIST, as the <HI>Lord our Righ|teousness;</HI> not a Word of CHRIST, as having <HI>purchased his Church with his own Blood;</HI> not a Word of the <HI>Righteousness which is of God by Faith</HI> in CHRIST; and in Effect, nothing of the main Contents of the <HI>Gospel of Peace,</HI> as such. Nor can I discern the least Savour of true <HI>Evangelical</HI> Preaching in all this Discourse of his.</P>
<P>But let us attend our <HI>Author'</HI>s Answer to this Objection. <Q>The Difficulty (he thinks) will intirely vanish, when we come to adjust our Notions of the Thing.</Q> Which he attempts mainly in the Language and under the Counte|nance of one whom he calls "<HI>a late elegant Writer</HI>"&punc; who tells us, "To <HI>preach</HI> CHRIST is universally acknow|ledged to be the Duty of every <HI>Christian Minister.</HI>"&mdash;But what's the Ground of this Limitation? Why is the <HI>Christian</HI> Minister singled out? For if <HI>Morality</HI> be the <HI>Sum</HI> &amp; <HI>Substance</HI> of Christianity (as we have all along heard) and if to <HI>preach Christ</HI> means to preach <HI>moral Vertue</HI> (as likewise we have heard) surely then the Duty extends to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Mini|ster, to the <HI>Mahometan,</HI> yea and to the <HI>Pagan,</HI>&mdash;as well as the <HI>Christian</HI> Minister.&mdash;But this Writer tells us, first, what is <HI>not</HI> meant by <HI>preaching</HI> CHRIST. <Q>It is not (says

he) to use <HI>his Name</HI> as a <HI>Charm,</HI> to work up our Hearers to a warm <HI>Pitch</HI> of <HI>Enthusiasm;</HI> without any Founda|tion in <HI>Reason</HI> to support it.</Q> Well, by this, I suppose, we may learn what is one of those "<HI>Rabble-Charming</HI> Sounds" our Author speaks of (<HI>Pag.</HI> 23.) as "converting some into such <HI>fiery Bigots,</HI> that they are ready to die in the Defence of <HI>Stupidity</HI> and <HI>Nonsense.</HI>" Perhaps he looks upon that Sermon as truly deserving no better Character than this, where the <HI>Name</HI> of CHRIST is frequently repeat|ed, even tho' the Subject naturally leads to it, as being some Doctrine or Duty relating to <HI>Christ</HI> immediately. But verily <HI>to them which believe,</HI> CHRIST <HI>is precious,</HI> and <HI>his Name is as Oyntment poured forth.</HI> The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> has set us an Example, who appears far from being shy of mentioning the <HI>Name</HI> of CHRIST; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, he rather seems to delight in often repeating it; insomuch that he <HI>names the Name of</HI> CHRIST on some Occasions, no less than <HI>ten</HI> Times in just so many <HI>Verses</HI> (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.) and no less than <HI>seventeen</HI> or <HI>eighteen</HI> Times in one <HI>Chapter,</HI> as in <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. Where, by the Way, the Apostle expresly speaks of <HI>preaching</HI> CHRIST, <ABBR>v</ABBR> 15, 16, 18.&mdash;And if our Author, or the Writer he so highly commends and takes Sanctuary under, can reconcile what the inspired Writer says there, about <HI>preaching</HI> CHRIST, with their Notion of it's being to <HI>preach moral Vertue,</HI> the Controversy perhaps may soon be ended: but 'till then, let this Writer be who he will, I think it my Duty, not to forego a Certainty for an Uncertainty, and therefore choose rather to take my Measures from, and submit my Judgment to the Sentiments of this <HI>inspired</HI> Writer, <HI>Paul,</HI> than to our Author's <HI>elegant</HI> Writer, or any others whose <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> reach no farther than his seems to do, but terminate in <HI>Morality.</HI> It is the undoubted Duty of those who are <HI>Embassadors for</HI> CHRIST, to make frequent men|tion of <HI>his Name,</HI> both in their Sermons and Prayers; especially as it is expresly required of us, that <HI>whatever we do in Word or Deed, we should do all in the Name of the Lord Jesus, giving Thanks to God and the Father by him.</HI> Col. 3. 17.&mdash;For Ministers to omit <HI>naming the Name of</HI> CHRIST in their Discourses, under a Pretext of Caution, left

they should "<HI>Charm</HI> their Hearers, <HI>and work them up to a warm Pitch of Enthusiasm,</HI>" appears to me a <HI>senseless Super|stition</HI> indeed, of human and modern Invention, having no Foundation in Scripture-Precept or Example, nor counte|nanced by the primitive Christian Preachers.&mdash;Certainly as our Lord Jesus observes, <HI>Out of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth speaketh;</HI> and accordingly, I cannot but think, where Ministers have <HI>received the Love of the Truth,</HI> and have CHRIST much upon their <HI>Hearts,</HI> he will be much in their <HI>Mouths,</HI> nor will they scruple the explicit mention|ing of his <HI>Name</HI> frequently in their Praying &amp; Preaching; tho' in this, as in all other Cases, <HI>Wisdom is profitable to direct.</HI> Nor wou'd I be understood to lay so much Stress on the meer <HI>naming</HI> of CHRIST; but rather on the <HI>Pur|poses</HI> for which we name him, and the <HI>Representations</HI> we make of his <HI>Person and Character, Offices and Benefits, Doc|trine and Religion.</HI>&mdash;I shall not spend more Time at pre|sent, nor trouble my Reader any further with this <HI>elegant Writer'</HI>s Sentiments, (on which our Author, it seems, places such a mighty Dependance,) as he has delivered himself in such ambiguous Terms, and so exceptionably in general. Only I will take some Notice of his Manner of Expression, when he tells us positively his own Sense of what it is to <HI>preach</HI> CHRIST. It is, says he, <Q>to represent him as a Law|giver, as well as a Saviour, as <HI>a Preacher of Righteousness,</HI> as one who hath given us a most noble &amp; compleat <HI>System of Morality,</HI> enforced by the most substantial &amp; worthy Motives.</Q>&mdash;To what End, can we conceive, do's our Author introduce this his <HI>elegant Writer,</HI> as he stiles him? The Author is here pretending to vindicate his own Dis|course, and obviate an <HI>Objection</HI> he supposes made against it: but what do's this Quotation avail to his Purpose? Unless he might imagine (as probably he did) that this <HI>elegant Writer'</HI>s Authority wou'd bear an equal Sway on the Judgment of others, as it did upon his own. Whereas truly all the Service it has done him, that I can find, is only to <HI>conform</HI> the <HI>Objection;</HI> and prove, that his <HI>Writer</HI> and <HI>Himself</HI> together are little better than <HI>Pelagian Mora|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">,</HI> as there is much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> said of <HI>Faith in the Blood of Christ,</HI>

nothing of <HI>the Righteousness which is of God by Faith,</HI> nor of the other peculiar Doctrines of <HI>Christianity;</HI> only as they are spoken of mostly in a Way of <HI>Banter</HI> &amp; <HI>Contempt.</HI>&mdash;As for "the most substantial and worthy <HI>Motives,</HI>" this <HI>elegant</HI> Writer speaks of, these doubtless in his Opinion are those taken from the intrinsick Beauty and Excellency of <HI>Vertue,</HI> it's Advantages to <HI>Society,</HI> it's <HI>recommending</HI> us to God's Mercy, <HI>intitling</HI> us to Happiness, &amp;c. according to the Strain of our <HI>Author.</HI> But I think, the <HI>Vertue</HI> acquired only by such <HI>Motives</HI> as these, however commendable it may appear in the Eyes of Men, yet in the Sight of the Heart-searching God will never stand approved for true <HI>Christian Vertue.</HI> While Men are destitute of the <HI>Faith of God'</HI>s <HI>Elect,</HI> and without a vital <HI>Principle</HI> of Grace in the Heart, which is absolutely needful to govern their moral Actions, and lead them to the chief and ultimate End, they will, at best, but <HI>make a fair Shew in the Flesh,</HI> and will finally be found but <HI>as a sounding Brass, or a tinkling Cymbal.</HI></P>
<P>But possibly our <HI>Author</HI> might perceive himself under a Necessity here to <HI>correct</HI> his <HI>elegant Writer,</HI> on a review of the Sentiments he had offered; and finding that they no Way served his Purpose, so as to remove the <HI>Objection,</HI> therefore he hath <HI>interpolated</HI> his Quotation, by inserting the following <HI>Parenthesis,</HI> containing perhaps the best Sentence in all his Discourse, if it had been introduced in it's proper Time and Place.&mdash;He thus breaks in upon his <HI>Writer,</HI> and after the Word <HI>Motives,</HI> says <Q>(among which I may venture to mention as one of the most powerful, The Certainty of Forgiveness of Sins, and final Acceptance with the Father, through the Merits of the Son, upon the Condition of Faith, Repentance and Good-living.)</Q>&mdash;But it looks very strange, that our <HI>Author,</HI> who had been all along in his Discourse pleading up <HI>moral Vertue,</HI> as the <HI>Basis</HI> and <HI>whole Superstructure</HI> of Religion, and as that on which <HI>our wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">le Happiness is suspended,</HI> &amp;c. should now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> last <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> and croud them in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, out of Place; where his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Business was&punc; if he knew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">

had raised; without doing which, doubtless he was well aware, it wou'd unavoidably fall under the just Censure of every judicious &amp; cautious Reader. But it's <HI>odd</HI> in him now, instead of <HI>defending</HI> his Discourse, to fall to <HI>mending</HI> of it, by diverting to what seems to carry with it something of an <HI>Evangelical</HI> Aspect. Yet it in no Wise answers his pre|tended Purpose; the <HI>Objection</HI> stands in it's full Form and Force against him. And it is yet farther evident, that the <HI>Author</HI> has no great Regard to <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance:</HI> for, as we find in the Close of all, he sums up the Whole or Main of our Saviour'<HI>s</HI> Preaching in <HI>moral Vertue.</HI> Our Author's Words are, <Q>To preach up <HI>chiefly</HI> what CHRIST himself laid the <HI>chiefest Stress</HI> upon (and whether this was not <HI>moral Vertue,</HI> let every one judge from his Discourses) must certainly, in the Opinion of all sober Men, be called truly and properly, and in the best Sense <HI>preaching of</HI> CHRIST.</Q>&mdash;The Ambiguity of Expression here may be design'd, as in some other Parts of this <HI>Author's</HI> Performance, for an Evasion. However, it shews us the little Regard he has for <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> or indeed for the <HI>Honour</HI> of CHRIST, that he has so soon lost the Impression of these <HI>evangelical</HI> Words, and instantly returns again to his beloved <HI>Morality:</HI> and he visibly puts Contempt on CHRIST, by representing him as laying the <HI>chiefest Stress</HI> on <HI>moral Ver|tue,</HI> in his Preaching. Which I apprehend may be easily disproved. It is granted, Christ did preach up <HI>moral Ver|tue,</HI> rightly understood. As he <HI>came not to destroy, but to fulfill the Law,</HI> so he saw fit to explain and inculcate it on his Hearers: he saw meet, for the detection of Hypocrites, and awakening of Sinners, as well as for the Direction of his Disciples moral Conduct, to preach the <HI>Law,</HI> or lay before them "the eternal Rules of Morality." Yet notwithstanding&punc; it is Fact, that he began, continued and ended his Ministry with preaching the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and inculcating chiefly the Doctrines of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance.</HI> Christ <HI>began</HI> his publick Ministry on Earth with preach|ing up Faith and Repentance.

delivered in his Discourse: and possibly he is the more strengthen'd in his erroneous and unscriptural Way of Writing, by the Quotation he produces from that <HI>elegant Writer</HI> he speaks of. But I must assure him, I <HI>have not so learned</HI> CHRIST, as to treat his <HI>Person, Name, Offices, Miracles,</HI> and <HI>Preaching,</HI> with such dareing Marks of Con|tempt, or to detract from CHRIST the Glory of his <HI>Mission, Negociations,</HI> and <HI>Instructions,</HI> when here in the World.</P>
<P>Remarkable is the Confidence, with which our Author expresses his Sentiments, concerning <Q>what must cer|tainly be called truly and properly, and in the best Sense <HI>Preaching of</HI> CHRIST,</Q> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the preaching up <HI>moral Vertue;</HI> &amp; this to be understood, with a common Neglect of <HI>Faith</HI> in <HI>Christ, and the Righteousness</HI> which is of Faith<HI>:</HI> He doubtless intended this Observation as a Point of <HI>Doctrine,</HI> enforced by his <HI>own</HI> and his <HI>elegant Writer's</HI> Au|thority. He must mean it, I think, as an <HI>Instruction</HI> to <HI>others,</HI> as well as a Vindication of his Discourse. If only to take off the <HI>Objection</HI> laid against this, was his De|sign, he has strangely miss'd his Aim: For he has strongly confirmed it, by telling us, That preaching up <HI>moral Ver|tue,</HI> is <HI>truly and properly and in the best Sense preaching</HI> CHRIST.&mdash;But probably he design'd this for a standing <HI>Rule,</HI> to direct Ministers how to <HI>preach</HI> CHRIST, <HI>in the Pro|perest and best Manner:</HI> And he might intend his Discourse to be a <HI>Model</HI> or <HI>Pattern</HI> for them to Copy after.&mdash;How|ever, as I trust, there are few of the Ministers in these <HI>New-England</HI> Churches, led away from the Truth, to that De|gree, as to e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ertain their Hearers with such <HI>idle Specula|tions,</HI> and jejune Harangues on Morality: So I would hope, none of the <HI>Candidates</HI> for the Pulpit will receive his Arbitrary Dictates in his present Discourse. The <HI>moral Vertue</HI> our Author has discoursed of, is not that <HI>true Holiness,</HI> which CHRIST commends to us in the Gospel: but rather is like the <HI>Righteousness of the</HI> unbelieving <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es,</HI> on which our <HI>Lord</HI> did manifestly cast Con|tempt, and therefore could not <HI>lay the chiefest Stress</HI> upon it.&mdash;Paul <HI>testified both to the Jews and Greeks, Repentance toward God&punc; and Faith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Jesus Christ.</HI> It was

<P>Upon the whole, whether our <HI>Author</HI> will look upon <HI>me</HI> among the Number of <HI>sober</HI> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n or not, I cannot but bear my publick Testimony against this unjustifiable <HI>Discourse</HI> of his, which I have been remarking upon.

And as one that is <HI>not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ,</HI> I can't but own my self greatly ashamed and grieved, that any who bear the Cha|racter of <HI>sober</HI> Men, and have been trained up in the Prin|ciples of our holy Religion, by their being catechised and other Ways instructed therein, shou'd notwithstanding be so ignorant, as not to see, or so prejudiced and partial, as not to confess, the <HI>Absurdity</HI> and the <HI>blasphemous</HI> Tendency of such a Discourse, as this of our Author appears in my Eyes manifestly to be.</P>
