<P>(The Book is called, The Principles of the <HI>Protestant Religion</HI> maintained by the ministers of the Gospel in <HI>Boston.</HI>) Page 63. 64.</P>
<P>Now, some People of the Country, and Priests also (upon Discourse) have made as if they were sorry and Troubled for what they had cone, in Hang|ing the said People.</P>
<P>But these four Priests seeme Bloody still, in saying they were not abused, but Dealt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with &amp;c. Covering themselves under this falshood, and for a Refuge make this Lye.</P>
<P>That they came Purposely to undermine the Civil Government, and to perswade the People to Renoun|ce it.</P>
<P>This is a high Charge, founded unto the world: And what is it? But to make the world believe, that we are a seditious People not worthy to Live, and to stirr up Nations and People against us, to destroy us from the Earth. The charge is high, and Positive.</P>

<P>But where is the proof?

<P>Indeed, there were that suborned men to witness against <HI>Stephen,</HI> which said.</P>
<P>We have heard him speak Blasphemous words a|gainst <HI>Moses</HI> and against <HI>God:</HI> And ceaseth not to speak Blasphemous words against this holy Place and the Law: For we have heard him say, This <HI>Jesus</HI> of <HI>Nazereth</HI> shall destroy this place and shall change the customs which <HI>Moses</HI> Delivered to us. Acts. 6. 11. 12. 13.</P>
<P>These were of the Synagogune of the Libertines, who took great Liberty (in their malice and Envie, to sound out Lyes, to make <HI>Sthephen,</HI> that Blessed and Good man,) to Looke as criminal as ever they could: As if he were purposed to Destroy the place and change the Customs &amp;c.

<P>And this was for his faith and Testimony's sake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,

in Testifying to the truth; That they thus shame|fully, and wickedly, turned things against him: So now&punc; It must not be said, the <HI>Quakers</HI> where put to Death upon a Religious account for Testi|fying to the Truth: That will Look hard, and of an ill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the World, that they who came to <HI>New-England</HI> Upon the account of Religi|on should now Persecute others, for the same: No, no, Let it be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> abroad, and said.</P>
<P>They came purposely to Undermine the civil <HI>Go|vernment,</HI> and perswade the People to Renounce it.</P>
<P>And this it may be will take with the People, that they were not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, but dealt Iustly with.</P>
<P>And as it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to see, and know, who were the chief in stirring up the People&punc; and Rulers to this great evil in killing the <HI>Quakers:</HI> so also you may see who are the chief in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Coun|try and World with a lye for their excuse: That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they had hanged the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and many of the Country sorry for it; Yet, These <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oure Priests stand up to Iustifie the act, In saying They were not abused but dealt Iustly with.

<P>And Especially the two worthy's, who had now near finisht their course: They standindg faithfull in their Testimony to God: by which they obtained witness: For God had said unto them, and given them a sure word: <HI>That their soules should rest in Eter|nal peace,</HI> as you may see hereafter by their own writings: And this Comfort they had in their sore Tryals, near unto death for <HI>God</HI> was with them, and bore them through with a heavenly chearful|ness: And many sweet and heavenly sayings they gave unto us; being themselves filled, with comfort; for so also said the Apostle: <HI>I am filled with comfort, I am Exceeding joyfull in all our Tribulations</HI> 2 Cor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">: 4.</P>
