<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>FROM a consciousness of inability, MY FRIENDS AND FELLOW COUNTRYMEN, I have repeatedly declined the duties of this ANNIVERSARY. Nothing but a firm at|tachment to the tottering <HI>liberties</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Periculosae plenum opus aleae Tractas, incedis per ignes Suppositos cineri doloso.</NOTE> added to the irresistable importunity of some valued friends; could have induced me (especially with a very short notice) so far to mistake my abilities, as to render the utmost Extent of your candor truly indispensable.</P>
<P>WHEN man was unconnected by social obligations; ab|horrent to every idea of dependence; actuated by a savage ferocity of mind, displayed in the brutality of his manners; the necessary exigencies of each individual naturally im|pelled him, to acts of treachery, violence and murder.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="012721_0005_0F8BC2A1C173FA90">THE miseries of mankind thus proclaiming eternal war with their species, led them probably to consult certain measures to arrest the current of such outrageous enor|mities.</P>
<P>A SENSE of their wants and weakness in a state of nature, doubtless inclined them to such reciprocal aids and sup|port, as eventually established society.</P>
<P>MEN then began to incorporate; subordination succeed|ed to independence; order to anarchy; and passions were disarmed by civilization: Society lent its aid to se|cure the weak from oppression, who wisely took shelter within the sanctuary of law.</P>
<P>ENCREASING society afterwards exacted, that the tacit contract made with her by each individual at the time of his being incorporated, should receive a more solemn form to become authentic and irrefragable; the main object be|ing to add force to the laws, proportionate to the power, and extent of the body corporate, whose energy they were to direct.</P>
<P>THEN <HI>society</HI> availed herself of the sacrifice of that <HI>liber|ty,</HI> and that <HI>natural equality</HI> of which we are all consci|ous
<PB N="7" REF="012721_0006_0F8BC2A407308BB0">
superiors and magistrates were appointed, and mankind submitted to a civil and political subordination. This is truly a glorious inspiration of reason, by whose in|fluence, notwithstanding the inclination we have for inde|pendance, we accept controul, for the establishment of order.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH, unrestrained power in one person may have been the first and most natural recourse of man|kind from rapine and disorder; yet all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> power, made by laws, or participation of sovereign <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> apparent improvements upon what began in unlimited power.</P>
<P>IT would shock humanity, should I attempt to describe those barbarous and tragic scenes, which crimson the his|toric page of this wretched and detestable constitution, where absolute dominion is lodged in one person: Where <HI>one</HI> makes the <HI>whole,</HI> and the <HI>whole</HI> is <HI>nothing.</HI> What motives, what events, could have been able to subdue men, endowed with reason, to render themselves the mute instruments and passive objects of the caprice of an individual!</P>
<P>MANKIND apprized of their privileges, in being rational and free; in prescribing civil laws to themselves, had sure|ly no intention of being enchained by any of their equals:
<PB N="8" REF="012721_0007_0F8BC2A4B9F5BCF0">
and although they submitted voluntary adherents to certain laws for the sake of mutual security and happiness; they no doubt intended by the original compact, a permanent exemption of the subject body, from any claims, which were not expressly surrendered, for the purpose of obtaining the security and defence of the whole: Can it possibly be con|ceived that they would voluntarily be enslaved, by a power of their own creation?</P>
<P>THE constitution of a <HI>magistrate,</HI> does not therefore take away that lawful defence against force and injury, allowed by the law of nature; we are not to obey a Prince, ruling above the limits of the power entrusted to him; for the <HI>Common-wealth</HI> by constituting a head does not deprive itself of the power of its own preservation. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The celebrated Mrs. Maccauley.</NOTE> <HI>Government</HI> or <HI>Magistracy</HI> whether supreme or subordinate is a mere <HI>human ordinance,</HI> and the laws of every nation are the measure of magistratical power: And Kings, the servants of the state, when they degenerate into tyrants, forfeit their right to government.</P>
<P>A BREACH of trust in a governor, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> or attempting to enlarge a limited power; effectually absolves subjects from every bond of covenant and peace; the crimes acted by a
<PB N="9" REF="012721_0008_0F8BC2A5AEE69780">
King against the people, are the highest treason <HI>against the highest law among men.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salus populi suprema lex esto.</NOTE></P>
<P>"IF the King (says Grotius) hath one part of the supreme power, and the other part is in the senate or people, when such a King shall invade that part which doth not belong to him, it shall be lawful to oppose a just force to him, be|cause his power doth not extend so far."</P>
<P>THE question in short turns upon this single point, re|specting the power of the civil magistrate: Is it the end of that office, that one particular person may do what he will without restraint? or rather that society should be made happy and secure? the answer is very obvious &mdash; And it is my firm opinion that the <HI>equal Iustice</HI> of GOD, and <HI>natural freedom of mankind</HI> must stand or fall together.</P>
<P>WHEN rulers become tyrants, they cease to be Kings; they can no longer be respected as GOD's <HI>vicegerents,</HI> who violate the laws they were sworn to protect: The <HI>preacher</HI> may tell us of <HI>passive obedience,</HI> that tyrants are scourges in the hands of a righteous GOD to chastise a sinful nation, and are to be submitted to like plagues, famine and such like
<PB N="10" REF="012721_0009_0F8BC2A6442105A8">
judgments: such doctrine may serve to mislead ill-judging Princes into a false security; but men are not to be ha|rangued out of their senses; human nature and self pre|servation will eternally arm the brave and vigilant, against slavery and oppression.</P>
<P>As a despotic government <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ingratitude and corruption of Rome, is perhaps in no instance more strongly marked than in her, treatment of her colonies, by their labours, toils, and arms she had reached to that summit of glorious exaltation as to be like BRITAIN the wonder and dread of the world; but by fatal experience those ruined colonies, inculcate this serious lesson, the ambition of a DESPOT is boundless, his rapine is insatiable, the accomplishment of his conquests over his enemies, is but the introduction of slavery, with her concommitant plagues, to his friends.</NOTE> is evidently productive of the most shocking calamities, whatever tends to restrain such inordinate power, though in itself a severe evil, is extremely beneficial to society; for where a degrading servitude is the detestable alternative, who can shudder at the reluctant ponyard of a <HI>Brutus,</HI> the crimsoned ax of a <HI>Cromwell,</HI> or the reeking dagger of a <HI>Ravilliac?</HI></P>
<P>To enjoy life as becomes rational creatures, to possess our souls with pleasure and satisfaction we must be careful to maintain that inestimable blessing, LIBERTY. By <HI>liberty</HI> I would be understood, the happiness of living under laws of
<PB N="11" REF="012721_0010_0F8BC2AB35FC30C0">
our own making, by our personal consent or that of our representatives.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The very idea of a representative, deputy or trustee includes that of a constituent, whose interest they are ordained and appointed to promote and secure; my unappointed self-constituted agent in the british parliament, has fraudulently and arbitrarily surrendered my best interest without my privity or consent; I do therefore hereby protest against all such powers as he shall claim in my behalf, and most solemnly discard him my service forever. <HI>See</HI> Lock <HI>civil government Risum tene<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">tis amici!</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>WITHOUT this, the distinctions among mankind, are but different degrees of misery; for as the true estimate of a man's life consists in conducting it according to his own just sentiments and innocent inclinations, his being is degraded below that of a free agent, which heaven has made him, when his affections and passions are no longer governed by the dictates of his own mind, and the interests of human society, but by the arbi|trary, unrestrained will of another.</P>
<P>I THANK GOD we live in an age of rational inqui|sition, when the unfettered mind dares to expatiate freely on every object worthy its attention, when the privileges of mankind are thoroughly comprehended, and the rights of distinct societies are objects of liberal enquiry. The rod of the tyrant no longer excites our apprehensions, and to the frown of the DESPOT which
<PB N="12" REF="012721_0011_0F8BC2AC0BD69FD8">
made the darker ages tremble, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coelum, non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt. The citizens of Rome, Sparta or Lacedaemon, at those blessed periods when they were most eminent for their attachment to liberty and virtue, could never exhibit brighter examples of patriotic zeal than are to be found at this day in <HI>America,</HI> I will not presume to say that the origi|nal british spirit has improved by transplanting; but this I dare affirm, that should <HI>Britains</HI> stoop to oppression, the struggles of their <HI>American brethren</HI> will be their eternal reproach.</NOTE> we dare oppose de|mands of right, and appeal to that constitution, which holds even Kings in fetters.</P>
<P>IT is easy to project the subversion of a people, when men behold them, the ignorant or indolent victims of power; but it is extremely difficult to effect their ruin, when they are apprized of their just claims, and are sensibly and seasonably affected with thoughts for their preservation. GOD be thanked, the alarm is gone forth, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The instituting a <HI>Committee of grievances and correspondence,</HI> by the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of <HI>Boston,</HI> has served this very valuable purpose: The general infrac|tion of the rights of all the colonies, must finally reduce the discord|ant <HI>provinces,</HI> to a necessary combination for their mutual interest and defence: Some future congress, will be the glorious source of the salvation of <HI>America</HI>: The <HI>Amphictiones</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> who formed the diet or great council of the states; exhibit an excellent model for the rising <HI>Americans.</HI></NOTE> the people are universally informed of their CHARTER RIGHTS; they esteem them to be the ark of GOD to NEW-ENGLAND, and like that of old, may it deal de|struction to the profane hand, that shall dare to touch it.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="012721_0012_0F8BC2AC4958F1C0">IN every state or society of men, personal liberty and security must depend upon the collective power of the whole, acting for the general interest. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Lord chief Justice Coke observes "when any new device is moved in the King's behalf, for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> or the like; the commons may answer, they dare not agree without conference with their counties." The novel device of fleecing the colonies, was introduced in a way the <HI>constitu|tion</HI> knows not of, and crammed down their throats by measures equally iniquitous.</P>
<P>I will <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the sticklers for the present measures, by confronting <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> more state authorities; if they will permit me the fol|lowing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> express declaration of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, which they may chew <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. NO MAN CAN <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> WHICH IS ANOTHER'S.</P></NOTE> If this collec|tive power is not of the whole, the freedom and inte|rest of the whole is not secured: If this confluent po|wer acts by a partial delegation, or for a partial in|terest; it's operation is surely determinable, where it's delegation ends.</P>
<P>THE constitution of England, I revere to a degree of idolatry; but my attachment is to the common weal: The magistrate will ever command my respect, by the integrity and wisdom of his administrations.</P>
<P><HI>JUNIUS</HI> well observes; when the constitution is open|ly invaded, when the first original right of the people from which all laws derive their authority is directly attacked; inferior grievances naturally lose their force, and are suffered to pass by without punishment or ob|servation.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="012721_0013_0F8BC2AD00451F50">NUMBERLESS have been the attacks made upon our free constitution, numberless the grievances we now re|sent: But the <HI>Hydra</HI> mischief, is the violation of my right, as a BRITISH AMERICAN freeholder; in not being consulted in framing those statutes I am required to obey.</P>
<P>THE authority of the BRITISH monarch over this colony was established, and his power derived from the <HI>provincial</HI> CHARTER; by that we are entitled to a distinct legislation As in every government there must exist a power su|perior to the laws, <HI>viz.</HI> the power that makes those laws, and from which they derive their authority: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Nothing, continued: the Corporal, can be so sweet,</L>
<L>An' please your honor, as liberty;</L>
<L>Nothing <HI>Trim</HI>&mdash;said my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> musing&mdash;</L>
<L>Whil'st a man is free&mdash;cried the Corporal, giving a flourish with his stick thus.</L>
<BIBL>TRISTRAM SHANDY.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> therefore the liberty of the people is exactly proportioned to the share the body of the people have in the legislature; and the check placed in the constitution on the executive pow|er. That state only is free, where the people are govern|ed by laws which they have a share in making; and that country is totally enslaved, where one single law can be made or repealed, without the interposition or consent of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="012721_0014_0F8BC2ADC76CC1C0">THAT the members of the British Parliament are repre|sentatives of the whole British Empire, expressly militates with their avowed principles: Property and residence within the Island, alone constituting the right of election; and surely he is not my delegate in whose nomination or appointment I have no choice: But however the futile and absurd claim of a virtual representation, may comport with the Idea of a political visionary; he must (if possible) heighten the indignation, or excite the ridicule of a free born American, who by such a fallacious pretext would despoil him of his property.</P>
<P>AN American freeholder according to the <HI>just</HI> and <HI>judici|ous</HI> conduct of the present ministry, has no possible right to be consulted, in the disposal of his property: When a lordly, though <HI>unlettered British Elector,</HI> possessed of a turnip garden; with geat propriety may appoint a legislator, to assess the ample domains, of the most sensible opulent <HI>American</HI> planter.</P>
<P>BUT remember my <HI>Brethren</HI>! When a people have once sold their liberties, it is no act of extraordinary gene|rosity, to throw their lives and properties into the bar|gain, for they are poor indeed when enjoyed at the mercy of a master.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="012721_0015_0F8BC2AE8FE11810">THE late conduct of Great-Britain so inconsistent with the practice of former times, so subversive of the first prin|ciples of government, is sufficient to excite the discontent of the subject: The <HI>Americans</HI> justly and decently urged, an exclusive right of taxing themselves; was it indulgent conciliating or parental conduct in that state, to exagge|rate such a claim, as a concerted plan of rebellion in the wanton <HI>Americans?</HI> And by a rigorous and cruel exercise of power to enforce submission, excite such ani|mosities, as at some future period may produce a bitter repentance.</P>
<P>CAN such be called a legal tax or free gift? It is rather levying contributions on gruding enslaved <HI>Americans</HI> by virtue of an act framed and enforced, not only without, but against their consent; thereby rendering the provin|cial assemblies a useless part of the constitution.</P>
<P>WHERE laws are framed and assessments laid without a legal representation, and obedience to such acts urged by force, the despairing people robbed of every constitution|al means of redress, and that people brave and virtuous; must become the admiration of ages, should they not ap|peal to those powers, which the immutable laws of na|ture have lent to all mankind. <HI>Fear</HI> is a slender tye of

subjection, we detest those whom we fear, and wish destruc|tion to those we detest; but humanity, uprightness and good faith, with an apparent watchfulness for the welfare of the people, constitute the permanency, and are the firmest support of the <HI>sovereign's</HI> authority; for when violence is opposed to reason and justice, courage never wants an arm for it's defence.</P>
<P>WHAT dignity, what respect, what authority, can <HI>Bri|tain</HI> derive from her obstinate adherence to error? She stands convicted of violating her own principles, but per|severes with unrelenting severity; we implore for <HI>rights</HI> as a grace, she aggravates our distress, by lopping away another and another darling privilege; we ask for <HI>freedom</HI> and she sends the <HI>sword!</HI></P>
<P>To the wisdom, to the justice, to the piety of his most sacred Majesty, I unite in my appeal with this un|bounded Empire; GOD grant he may attend to the rei|terated prayer, instead of the murmurs of discontent, and the frowns of louring disaffection, we would universally hail him with those effusions of genuine joy, and dutious veneration, which the proudest DESPOT will vainly look for, from forced respect or ceremonial homage.</P>
