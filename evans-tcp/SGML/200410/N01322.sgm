<P>There was a time (<HI>as I have elsewhere noted</HI>) when a man might Live Seven Years in <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> and not see a <HI>Drunken man.</HI> But how is it now? Several sorts of Strong Liquors have been an occasion of the abounding of this Iniquity.

Cyder,</HI> and a Spirit Extracted out of it, has been much abused to Intemporence. Some observe that since it has been so, a strange Blast has been upon the fruit Trees, in many Places; so as that some whose Orchards have yielded five hundred Barrel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of <HI>Cyder</HI> in a Year, now produce

It is now called <HI>Rum</HI>; but it once had another Name, and a ridiculous one, viz. <HI>Kill Devil.</HI> Renowned Mr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> said, it should rather have been called, <HI>Kill men for the Devil.</HI> Notwithstanding it is a sort of Strong Drink which does wof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en; weakning their Memories &amp; Vnderstandings, &amp; shorten|ing their Lives; nevertheless, many (<HI>and som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> great pretenders to Religion</HI>) have been Enchanted with it. And <HI>English Men</HI> who call themselves <HI>Christians,</HI> have Debauched the miserable <HI>Indians</HI> with it; of which there have been some Tragical Effects. For in their Drink, the Indians have Committed horrid Murders. Besides what has been formerly, there were sad Examples two or three Years ago, when two Indians were Executed for ha|ving Murdered two other Indians; when all four of them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Murderers and the Murdered were Drunk.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sermons</HI> Emitted herewith, were both Preached &amp; Printed Nine and Thirty Years ago, in 1673. There was then need of Preaching &amp; Writing against this pre|vailing Evil.

<HEAD>SERMON, I.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Chapter we have the Substance of one of the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI>'s Sermons, of which there are two parts: The first doth concern <HI>Israel,</HI> to the 4<HI>th. ver.</HI> The second hath reference to <HI>Iudah,</HI> from thence to the end of the <HI>Chapter.</HI> The words before us fall under the first part of the Chapter, wherein we have,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="2" REF="001570_0005_0FB3D50FB7E2BB70">1. The Subject Persons to whom the Pro|phet speaketh; <HI>viz.</HI> The Ten Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> who are here called, <HI>The Crown of Pride</HI>; that is, A Proud Kingdom, and <HI>Ephraim</HI>: Often so it is, that <HI>Ephraim</HI> is put for the whole Kingdom of <HI>Israel,</HI> partly because <HI>Ephraim</HI> was an honou+rable Tribe, descended from <HI>Ioseph</HI> who was the best of all the Sons of <HI>Iacob</HI>; and partly be|cause <HI>Ephraim</HI> was the first Royal Tribe i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that Kingdom, <HI>Ieroboam</HI> who was the first King o|ver the Ten Tribes being an <HI>Ephraimite.</HI> Also the Subject that this Prophesie lights upon, is said to be <HI>the Head of the fat Valleys overcome with Wine,</HI> by which the City of <HI>Samaria</HI> is meant, which was built upon a Mountain to the which there were frui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ful Valleys belong|ing; thus described, because they did yield much Wine and Oyl. Now <HI>Samaria</HI> being the Royal City, the Place where the Court and Represen|tative Body of the whole People used to be, therefore it is put for all the Kingdom.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have the Judgment denounc'd by the Pro|phet against this Kingdom of <HI>Israel, Wo</HI> to them; <HI>i.e.</HI> Woful Misery shall surely come upon them: <HI>Wo</HI> to the Crown of Pride, <HI>Wo</HI> to the Drunkards, <HI>Wo</HI> to <HI>Ephraim.</HI> And in the Verses following we have a more particular description of the Wo which is in this Verse generally threatned, the sum whereof is, A denunciation of speedy &amp; utter Ruine, which was executed accordingly by <HI>Sal|man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sser.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="3" REF="001570_0006_0FB3D51147DF1360">3. We have the Causes of this Wo, <HI>viz.</HI> Their Sins; of which two are mentioned in the Text, Namely, <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Drunkenness.</HI> No doubt but there were many other Evils which they were guilty of; but these two were Principal, &amp; the Causes of many others, and thence put for all the rest. The DOCTRINE therefore from the Words, is,</P>
<P><HI>That Pride and Drunkenness are Two Woful Evils.</HI></P>
<P>Having Discoursed at several times concern|ing the Evil of that Sin of Pride, we proceed now to speak concerning that of Drunkenness. And in the Doctrinal handling of this Point, we shall only attend Two Things: [<HI>I.</HI>] To En|quire what that Drunkenness is that the Scrip|ture denounceth Wo against. [<HI>II.</HI>] How it doth appear that Drunkenness is a Woful Evil.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quest. I.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>What is that Drunkenness, against which the Scripture denounceth Wo?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Answ.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is a Twofold Drunkenness:</P>
<P N="1">(1.) A <HI>Drunkenness</HI> which is Metaphotical &amp; <HI>Spiritual,</HI> Isa. 51.21. <HI>O thou that art drunken, but not with wine.</HI> The Jews were in such a c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se, as Drunken men are wont to be in, by reason of the Wine of Divine Judgment that was gi|ven to them. And one may be Drunken with
<PB N="4" REF="001570_0007_0FB3D5159F0062D8">
Error and Spiritual Delusion; therefore is it said concerning Mystical <HI>Babylon,</HI> that is <HI>Rome,</HI> That <HI>the Inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her Fornication,</HI> Rev. 17.2. Antichristian Corrupt Doctrines do as it were intoxicate &amp; inebriate the Souls of them that do imbibe or embrace them: they become Drunkard-like, vertiginous thereby. Also one may be Drunk with Security, Isa. 29.9, 10. <HI>They are drunken but not with wine, they stagger but not with strong drink: for the Lord hath poured cut upon them the spirit of deep Sleep.</HI> Delusion and Security had made them as it were dead Drunk. Some think that that is the Drunken|ness which the Text speaketh of; for Pride and Security are wont to go together, the one being the cause of the other. <HI>Wo to the Drunkards,</HI> that is (say some) to those that are secure in their Sins, &amp; <HI>settled upon their Lees</HI> in an evil course. No doubt but that this is implied, &amp; partly intended here, but that is not the only nor the principal Evil here aimed at. Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>Drunkenness</HI> is taken in a <HI>Literal,</HI> Proper sense: There is Corporal as well as Spiritual Drunkenness, a Drunkenness which not so much the Soul as the Body is the subject of; and that is it which the Prophet here denounceth Judgment for: Therefore in the latter end of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">is Verse he speaketh of being <HI>overcome with w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e.</HI> The Valleys near <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ria</HI> abounded with
<PB N="5" REF="001570_0008_0FB3D51710A5B030">
fruitful Vines, whence they had store of Wine, and they abused that Creature to great Intem|perance. When men abuse their Bodies by <HI>im|moderate drinking,</HI> that's the Sin the Text Con|demns. Now further; there is,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Drunkenness</HI> in the sight of GOD, that is, <HI>when a man doth drink more wine, or of any other inebriating drink, than the Rule alloweth of:</HI> Eph. 5.18. <HI>Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess.</HI> The Apostle mentions Wine, because that was the common drink in those days, and the great|est danger was in respect of that, by reason of the strength and pleasantness thereof: But un|der that expression of Wine, all other inebria|ting drinks are comprehended. Now if there be any <HI>Excess</HI> in the use thereof, that's <HI>Drunken|ness</HI>; if there be an inordinate affection or love to strong drink, that's Drunkenness in the sight of Him that trieth the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ins and searcheth the Hearts. Hence the Apostle speaketh of the <HI>excess of wine,</HI> 1 Pet. 4.3. The Greek word (<HI>Dinophlogia,</HI>) there used noteth an inordi|nate affection and desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e after Wine. And <HI>So|lomon</HI>'s description of a Drunkard, is, that he is <HI>a lover of wine,</HI> Prov. 21.17. Such an one is an habitual Drunkard, and he whose practice is ac|cording to that inordinate Affection, is actually so: Yea, if a man doth but drink a cup of Wine more than is good for him, he is guilty of this <HI>woful Evil.</HI> As he that eateth more than is
<PB N="6" REF="001570_0009_0FB3D518AC5D44F0">
good for him, is guilty of the sin of Gluttony; so he that drinketh to any excess is justly charged with Drunkenness.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is <HI>Drunkenness in the sight of Men.</HI> Sometimes this Evil is so gross and notorious, as that the wholesome Laws of men take hold of it and Punish it; Namely, when a man is so <HI>overcome with wine,</HI> as that he c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n neither speak nor act like a rational Creature, when Reason is disturbed thereby, &amp; Sense &amp; Speech &amp; Motion fail, when neither the Head nor Hand can do their Offices aright: Prov. 16.9. <HI>A thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard.</HI> Had he his wits about him, he would not suffer thorns to be thrust into his hands. Psal. 107.27. <HI>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits end:</HI> This is palpable Drunkenness. We must know that a man may be deeply and damnably guilty of this Evil in the sight of God, though it should never proceed to those outragious out-breakings, whereby men cannot but observe it.</P>
<P>We come then unto the Second thing pro|pounded for the clearing of the Truth before us; <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Quest. II.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>How doth it appear that Drunkenness is a Woful Evil?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Answ.</SPEAKER>
<P>Several things may here be mentioned, as Demonstrations of the Doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>If we look into the Original &amp; Causes of this
<PB N="7" REF="001570_0010_0FB3D51A50F90050">
Sin, we shall see the Evil of it.</HI> It hath no better an Author than the Devil himself, who never was the Author of any good (except acciden|tally, besides his intention, &amp; against his will) since he was a Devil. Drink is in it self a good Creature of God, &amp; to be received with thank|fulness; but the abuse of drink is from Satan: The Wine is from God, but the Drunkard is from the Devil; 1 Joh. 3.8. <HI>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil; for the Devil Sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose was the Son of God manifest, that He might destroy the works of the De|vil.</HI> Therefore he that committeth Drunken|ness (for that is Sin) that is, (if in his ordi|nary course he commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">) is of the Devil. Drunkenness was one of the works of the Devil which Christ came to destroy. It hath also a|nother Cause, as bad, nay worse than the Devil, namely, Sin. It is a Sin, and the Cause of Sin, (as afterwards will be shewed) and also the Effect of Sin. Therefore what a woful Evil is it? That Corrupt Nature which is in sinners, causeth them to become guilty of this Evil; J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m. 1.14. <HI>He is drawn array of his own lust, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nticed.</HI> When a sinner is drawn into Drunken|ness, his own Lust hath enticed him. Hence Drunkenness is exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">esly &amp; by name mentioned amongst the works of the Flesh; Gal. 5.19 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">1. <HI>The works of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">h are manifest, drunkenness, re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ellings, and such like.</HI> How woful must that
<PB N="8" REF="001570_0011_0FB3D51DCD591570">
Evil needs be, that hath no other Causes but such as these?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The very Light &amp; Law of Nature Condemns this Practice.</HI> Drunkards sin not only against the written Word of God, but against that Light and Law which is written in their Consciences. Now those are woful Transgressions. The A|postle doth aggravate the sins of some, in that <HI>in those things which they know naturally, as bruit Beasts they corrupt themselves,</HI> Jude ver. 10. A Drunkard, tho' he be a bruit Beast, yet he know|eth Naturally that he ought not to Corrupt himself with this vile Practice. If there were no Scripture to Condemn this Evil, yet he hath that within him, a Candle of the Lord in his own Breast, which sheweth him that this is an I|niquity which the Judge will Punish. Hence even Heathens, that have had nothing but the Ligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Nature to guide them, yet have spoken against this Evil, yea, and made severe Laws to Punish it. <HI>Solon</HI> (who is accounted amongst the wisest of the <HI>Grecian Princes</HI>) made it a Law. That if a man in Publick Place should abuse himself with Drink, his Crime should be deemed Capital. If he were Drunken but once, he was Punished with Death for that Transgression: Which I mention not to justify the severity of that Law, but to shew how Odious this detesta|ble Evil hath been even to those who had nothing but the Light of Nature &amp; Reason to guide them.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="9" REF="001570_0012_0FB3D51EAB6FBC58">3. <HI>A Drunkard is an Universal Transgressor of the whole Law of God. James</HI> saith, Chap. 2. v. 10. <HI>Whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</HI> We cannot say con|cerning the Drunkard, that he keeps the whole Law, or that he offends in one point only; but we must say, that <HI>he is guily of all,</HI> even guilty of the breach of all the Commandments: and that not only as he that breaketh one link in a Chain may be said to break the whole Chain, but he hath broken every link, that is, every Precep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of that Divine Chain of the Royal Law. If the question be, Which of the Commandments is Drunkenness a Transgression of? The answer must be, Not of one alone, but it is a general Violation of the whole Law, &amp; of every Precept therein. The Drunkard is an <HI>Idolater,</HI> for he loveth Drink as he should love God, that is, a|bove all, even above Wife &amp; Children, &amp; Name and Estate, and every thing that he hath in this world. And there is <HI>Robbery, Adultery,</HI> nay, <HI>Murther</HI> enwrapped in the bowels of this sin, as afterwards will appear. The Drunkard is a Transgressor against the <HI>First Table</HI> of the Moral Law, in as much as by this Sin he is rendred un|fit to Worship God in any Religious Duty: for <HI>wine taketh away the Heart,</HI> Hos. 4.11. But the Heart must be given to God in every Duty: if he Pray it must be with Understanding; and therefore when th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> is taken away by Drink,
<PB N="10" REF="001570_0013_0FB3D5202D2AE978">
what work will he make of it? Should a Vile Sinner dare to appear before God when he is in drink, he would but take the Lord's Name in Vain, and bring Wrath &amp; a Curse upon his own Soul. Some think that <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u</HI> were distemper'd with drink, when <HI>they offered strange Fire before the Lord</HI>; and conceive that to be the reason of their so miscarrying, because presently after the Story of their Sin &amp; Death, the Lord saith, <HI>Do not drink wine or strong drink when ye go into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t ye die,</HI> Lev. 10.9. But tho' that conjecture be uncertain, yet it is certain, that excess in Wine will unfi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for any Religious service: and he that shall ven|ture to worship God when it is so with him, will <HI>offer strange Fire</HI>; and hath more cause to fear that he shall die before the Lord, than to expect any merciful Answer to those polluted Prayers, which are but as corrupt breath, enough to stain the Heavens. If his Breath stink, by his being o|vercome with Wine in the nostrils of men, how do his Prayers stink in the Lord's nostrils? Moreover, The Drunkard is a Transgressor of the Rule of <HI>Honesty</HI> as well as of <HI>Piety</HI>; therefore saith the Scripture, <HI>Let us walk honestly, not in drunkenness,</HI> Rom. 13.13. So that the Word of God will bear us out in calling those that deserve the Name of Drunkards, Impious and Dishonest Persons.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Drunkenness is a wastful, destructive Evil,</HI> which is another thing which sheweth the Wo|fulness
<PB N="11" REF="001570_0014_0FB3D521A82B18A8">
of it. A Drunkard is a meer stroy-good. Wherefore the Apostle saith that in Wine there is <HI>Excess, Eph.</HI> 5.18. The Greek word (<HI>Alotia,</HI>) which is there used, signifieth <HI>wastful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ess</HI> &amp; <HI>prodi|gality:</HI> It is the same word which is used con|cerning the Prodigal, when tis said he wasted his Substance with <HI>Riotous</HI> Living, <HI>Luk.</HI> 15.13. There is much Prodigality, Riot, Profuseness in this sin: For thereby <HI>the good Creatures of God are wasted,</HI> which is contrary to the express charge of the Lord Jesus, who hath said, <HI>Let nothing be lost</HI> Joh 6.12. But all that is spent in Drunken|ness is wofully lost. And this Consideration proveth that a Drunkard is a woful guilty Crea|ture before the Lord, for so are they that take His Name in Vain. It is said in the Third Com|mandment, that <HI>God will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in Vain</HI>; which doth intimate that such Sinners are exceeding Guilty before the Lord. Now to abuse any of His Creatures, is to take His Name in Vain: In this respect, Drunkenness is a Breach of the Third Com|mandment. It is also a <HI>great waster of Precious Time</HI>: Men have no need to be Prodigal of their <HI>Time</HI>; they have not so much of it: <HI>For what is your Life? It is even a Vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away,</HI> Jam. 4.14. Nay, it is b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t a <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ment</HI> comparatively that a|ny one hath to be in this world: <HI>In a moment they go down into the Grave</HI>; and it is a thousand
<PB N="12" REF="001570_0015_0FB3D5232B54E158">
pities that any part of that moment should be lost; yet all is lost that is spent in Rioting and Drunkenness: For that time is lost, which a man cannot give a comfortable account concerning the spending of it unto Jesus Christ at the Last Day. Most certain it is, that all men shall be called to an account in that Solemn Great Day which is at hand, as for all Talents which they have been trusted with, so in special for that great and precious Talent of <HI>Time</HI>: But what answer can be given for the <HI>Time</HI> that hath been consumed in Lewd &amp; Drunken Practices? When it shall be said to such sinners in the hearing of Heaven &amp; Earth, You had such a space of Time allowed to you in the world, you Lived so many Years upon Earth, but how did you spend that Time? And when Conscience shall bring in a <HI>black Bill of Indictment,</HI> and say, <HI>There were so many days &amp; nights spent in rioting &amp; drunkenness,</HI> what answer can you give for this, when we shall all stand before the Son of God <HI>in that day</HI>? Yet more, Drunkenness is a great <HI>waster of a mans Estate.</HI> How common is it for those that are given to this Vice, if they gain any thing when they are Sober, to lose it again when they are in Drink? Yea, it may be to lose more in one drunken Day or Night, than they gain in many Days, Weeks, Months, Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs perhaps?

I doubt not but that there are many here this Day, that were never guilty of this Sin (at least-wise not in sight of men) in all their Lives: But unto whom are you Beholden for this Preservation, but unto the Preventing Grace of GOD? Will you say that there is a Principle of <HI>Inherent Grace</HI> within you, whereby you have been kept from this, &amp; other the like Enormities?

Therefore be hum|bly Thankful to the God of all Grace. But much more have they cause to be for ever Thankful, who are Mortified unto this Sin: For a man may possibly never Commit this Evil outwardly, and yet the Sin not Mortified in him; it may be he may not have an Opportunity to practise this Iniquity; or fear of Punishment, or Shame may deter him, &amp; yet he is not Mortified to it. This Sin is Mortified, when a man doth forsake and abhor it more than Death or Hell, because God is thereby Offended, &amp; Dishonoured; they that do so shall not Dye, but Live; Rom. 8.13. <HI>If ye live after the Flesh, ye shall a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e: but if you through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</HI> Drunkenness is one of the <HI>deeds of the Body</HI> &amp; of <HI>the Flesh</HI>; I do not say that he that doth not <HI>Commit</HI> that Sin shall Live, but he that doth <HI>Mortify</HI> it shall Live: For as he that <HI>Repenteth</HI> truly of <HI>One Sin, Repents of All</HI>; so he that indeed is <HI>Mortified</HI> to <HI>One Sin, is so to All</HI>: Such then shall Live, &amp; therefore have abundant cause of <HI>Rejoycing</HI> &amp; <HI>Thankfulness</HI> before the Lord.</P>

there hath been much Excess herein, that any should have cause so to speak or think. And how many are there that must be reckoned a|mongst woful <HI>Drunkards,</HI> that nevertheless do not believe any such thing of themselves? There are that flatter themselves in their Iniquity, and think that they are hardly guilty of this sin, be|cause they are not wont to be subject to such, worse than Beastly Drunkenness, as not to be a|ble to understand what they do or say; when as it may be the reason of it is, because by using themselves to Excess in Drinking, they are able to bear a great deal. Now that's worse than to be meerly Drunken; for it is to be a Drun|kard: One may be Drunken, that is not a Drun|kard; and one may be a Drunkard, that is sel|dom Drunken. He that abhors the Sin of Drun|kenness, yet may be overtaken with it, and so Drunken; But that one Act is not enough to denominate him a Drunkard: And he that loveth to drink Wine to Excess, tho' he should seldom be Overcome thereby, is one of those Drunkards upon whom the <HI>Wo</HI> in the Text doth directly fall.

Oh!

I might tell you; that an Author worthy of Credit, Relates that a Minister having Preached a Sermon against Drunkenness, a Profane Drun|kard that was in the Congregation, went out &amp; Scoffed and Mocked at what he had heard; and God smote him by a strange Providence, that he Died forthwith, even whilest he was deri|ding at the Sermon which he had newly heard. Will you Provoke the Lord to Jealousie? Are you stronger than He? But if there be any Drunkards in the Congregation so desperate, as to go on still in the Commission of this Tres|pass against the Lord, be it known to you, That your Blood shall be upon your own Heads. I remember what God said to His Prophet <HI>Eze|kiel,</HI> Chap. 33. ver. 7, 8. <HI>Son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak, to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand.</HI> O Lord, I Tremble to think of that! That the Blood of any Poor Soul shall be Required of me: I trust in Christ that it shall not be so. I trust that none amongst you shall
<PB N="47" REF="001570_0050_0FB3DCA79A07BA10">
be able to say to me, when we shall all appear before the Judgment-seat of Christ, <HI>Had you that Taught us the word of God, told us the evil of our ways, had you faithfully warned us of our danger, we would not have gone on therein.</HI> I remember also what the Lord further saith, Ver. 9. <HI>Ne|vertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way, to turn from it: if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.</HI> Now then, I call Heaven and Earth to Record against you this Day, that I have Warn|ed you of this Sin to turn from it: Let Men &amp; Angels that are here present, bear me witness at the Last Day, that I have not shunned nor spared to declare unto you <HI>the Woes</HI> that will certainly follow upon continuance in this Evil. Therefore if there be any Drunkard that will be a Drunkard still, he shall die in his Iniquity; but I have delivered my Soul.</P>
<P>USE, IV. <HI>Let it be of EXHORTATI|ON; and that in Three words.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let every one Endeavour the Suppression and Extirpation of this Evil.</HI> This we should do, by Labouring to Pray it down. When we are taught to Pray that the <HI>Name of God may be Hallowed,</HI> therein is implied, That we must Pray that this and such like other Evils, whereby His Glorious Name is much dishonoured, may be
<PB N="48" REF="001570_0051_0FB3DCA9172241A8">
suppressed. And there are some that ought to do more than meerly to Pray against it; Ministers must bear Witness against it in their way: And it concerns those that have any Civil Power in their Hands, to bear Witness against it in their way. If there were Magistrates in this Assembly, I would speak to them in His Name <HI>by whom Kings Reign, and Princes decree Iustice, and all the Iudges of the Earth,</HI> and Exhort them to draw forth the Sword of Justice against this Evil.</P>
<P>The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> are sundry of you that stand in some Publick Capacity, <HI>Townsmen, Constables, Grand-Iury-men, &amp;c.</HI> Behold the Word of the Lord is unto you in Particular this Day; I lay the Solemn Charge of GOD upon you, that you do your Utmost towards the Suppression of this Abounding Iniquity: Kill this Serpent before it be grown too Big for you. And therefore take heed that there be not thro' your Means, or thro' your Neglect, that which is the Fountain of this Evil; I mean, that there be not a Mul|tiplication of Taverns, and Ale houses, or the like, more than there is Need for. I know, that in such a great Town as this, there is Need of such Houses, and no Sober Minister will speak against the Licensing of them; but I wish there be not more of them than there is any Need of&punc; Especially, see that you keep a Vigilant Eye over these Private, Dark Houses, where wicked
<PB N="49" REF="001570_0052_0FB3DCAA987E4B50">
Persons Sell Drink and Destroy Souls to get a little Money; and which do more Mischief, than all the Publick Houses do Good, as being the very Sinks of Sin, whereby Youth is wofully Corrupted among<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> us. And if you find out any that have made a Trade of this Iniquity, and that have got part of their Living by the Blood and Destruction of Precious Souls, see that you bring them forth to Condign Punish|ment; and as they have been Exemplary in Sinning, so let them be brought under Exem|plary Punishment, that <HI>All Israel may Hear, and Fear, and do no more so Wickedly.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Much more, <HI>Let every one be Exhorted to beware of being Subject to, or coming any way under the Dominion of this Iniquity.</HI> For Motives, Re|member what was said in the last Use, as also formerly concerning the Wofulness of this Evil. By way of Direction here, I shall only say Two things.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>Take heed of the Occasions &amp; Temptations leading unto this Evil.</HI> Some there are that will Pray against this Sin, and yet they will cast themselves upon Temptations to it, which is to take God's Name in Vain; Even as if a man should put his hand into the Fire, and then Pray that he might not be Burnt: Would you not say that such a one did Mock the Lord? And what do they do less, who Pray that they
<PB N="50" REF="001570_0053_0FB3DCAC17356418">
may not be Drunk, and yet will not avoid Temptations that lead unto it. As now, <HI>Idleness</HI> is a Temptation leading unto Drunkenness: When Vile Persons have nothing else to do, then they must go to the Tavern, and drink till they be Drunken. <HI>Idleness &amp; fulness of Bread</HI>; so Idleness and fulness of Drink are wont to go together, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.49. Therefore take heed of Idleness, If you would escape Drunkenness. And take heed of <HI>Company-keeping</HI> with those that would draw you unto this Evil: <HI>My Son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not: walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path.</HI> Take the Counsel which the Holy Ghost giveth by <HI>Solomon,</HI> Prov. 23.20. <HI>Be not amongst wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e-bibbers.</HI> Avoid familiar Fellowship with Drunkards: Avoid them as you would do men that have the Plague upon them; yea, a Plague that will Infect, and be the Death of your pre|cious and immortal Souls. Remember that Scripture, Prov. 13.20. <HI>He that walketh with wise men shall be wise; but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.</HI> And take heed of being more, than you have any just Cause or Call to be, in Places where a Temptation unto this Sin is set before you: Go not to, Tarry not in Taverns or Or|dinary's, or in Houses where Strong Drink is Sold, without sufficient reason to bear you out in such a Practice. It is a sad thing, that Pro|fessors and Church-members should many of
<PB N="51" REF="001570_0054_0FB3DCAD9F77BD88">
them be guilty of Scandalizing the world in this respect. A Carnal Creature Excuseth him|self, saying, <HI>Why should not I go frequently to the Tavern? Such an one is a Church-member, and I see him there often; such an one is esteemed a Godly Man, and yet I have seen him sit for Hours together there; and why should not I do so as well as be?</HI> Thus doth the abuse of your Lawful Liberty become a Snare, and Ruine to many a poor Soul. Doth not the <HI>Scripture</HI> say, <HI>Look not upon the wine?</HI> Prov. 23.31. The meaning of which is, that men must avoid all Temptations unto Drunken|ness, as much as possibly may be. Drunken|ness is like the <HI>Basilisk,</HI> of whom they say, That if a man do but look upon it, he is thereby In|fected, and mortally Poisoned. Therefore it will be your wisdom to keep out of the sight of this Evil, and far away from what ever shall tend, and tempt unto it. One thing more I shall mention, as a great Occasion and Cause of this Sin, which therefore you ought to avoid, Namely, that Heathenish Custom of <HI>Health-drinking.</HI> It is an Heathenish, nay an Idolatrous Rite; witness those Ceremonies of putting off the Hat, yea, of Kneeling, (a gesture of Adoration) which are Customary amongst profane Health-drinkers. But the Word of God saith, <HI>Learn not the way of the Heathen; for the Custom of the</HI> [Heathen] <HI>People are Vain,</HI> Jer. 10.2, 3. And that Christians are <HI>Redeemed from
<PB N="52" REF="001570_0055_0FB3DCAF17BDF120">
their vain Conversation received by Tradition from fore-fathers,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.18. What should <HI>Christians</HI> do with the Mysteries and Ceremonies of <HI>Bac|chus?</HI> Do not think that only a few Puritan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or Precisians, have been against this Custom of drinking Healths: For tho' <HI>Papists</HI> indeed Plead for the Lawfulness of it, yet <HI>Protestants</HI> gene|rally Condemn it: And the Ancient <HI>Doctors</HI> in the Church have Thundred against this Pra|ctice; and that because it is (as they were wont to Express it) <HI>A Shoe-ing-horn to draw on Drunkenness</HI>: It is a <HI>Bacchean Artifice,</HI> which Satan hath devised for that end. The <HI>Scripture</HI> likewise doth plainly enough Reprove it, when <HI>Banquettings</HI> are Condemned, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.3. The Greek word (<HI>Potois,</HI>) which is there used, properly noteth a drinking by Number and Measure, as is usual amongst <HI>Health-drinkers.</HI> But especially when any shall be so Vile, as not only to drink Healths themselves, but to force others to do the like, their Practice is very Sin|ful and Abominable. Is there any in this Con|gregation that hath done thus, that hath com|pelled others to drink Healths, and will you go on to do so still? I <HI>testify</HI> from the Lord against that man, whoever he be, that an Heathen shall rise up in Judgment against him, and Condemn him at the Last Day: Witness else what is Written, <HI>Est.</HI> 1.8. It is there said, <HI>That the drinking was according to the law, none did compel;
<PB N="53" REF="001570_0056_0FB3DCB0984E5DC8">
for the king h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every mans pleasure.</HI> So that those Heathens would not force any man to drink more than he had a mind to. Therefore beware of that Evil Practice.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) There is another Rule, which if it be observed, you shall never be under the Domi|nion of this Iniquity, and if it be neglected, all other Precepts will be in Vain: It is this, <HI>Make sure of an Interest in</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>by Faith unfeigned in His Name.</HI> There are some, that in giving Directions tending to the Mor|tification of this Sin of <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> say to those that are guilty of it, That they must <HI>Pray,</HI> and add <HI>Fastings</HI> to their <HI>Prayers,</HI> and <HI>Vows</HI> to their <HI>Fastings</HI>; all which things are good, and see that you attend them in their due Order. But alas! The main thing of all is left out, if an <HI>Interest in Christ</HI> be not sought after, and made sure of. All <HI>Prayers, Tears, Resolutions, Fastings,</HI> and <HI>Vows</HI> against this Sin, will never subdue it without CHRIST. Go to <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> for Power against this, and all Corruptions: If thou art once in <HI>Christ,</HI> thou mayest by Faith obtain Power from the Blood of <HI>Christ,</HI> for the Killing of this Sin: If thou art in <HI>Christ,</HI> His Spirit also will Mor|tify it. Therefore the Scripture saith, <HI>That if you thro' the</HI> Spirit <HI>do mortify the deeds of the Body,</HI> Rom 8, 13. Make sure then of an <HI>Interest</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="001570_0057_0FB3DCB2209F1300">
in Jesus Christ, and His Spirit will Subdue and Mortify every <HI>Lust</HI> in thy Heart.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The last Word of</HI> Exhortation <HI>shall be unto those that have been Guilty of this Woful Sin of Drunkenness; Be this day Excited and Perswaded to Repent and Turn from this Transgression.</HI> Some of you have through Temptation been drawn into this Evil. How many Guilty, Accusing Consciences are there here before the Lord? Oh! Repent of what you have done, if ever you have given way to Temptation, so as to be overtaken with this so Vile an Abomination. Others (and many too) live in this Sin; in their ordinary Course they Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mit it, and therefore are Servants to it: Oh! Repent, Re|pent, before it be too Late. <HI>Remember, that ere long Repentance for it will be too late.</HI> Did not <HI>Dives</HI> Repent when it was too late? When his Soul was dropt down into the Place of Tor|ment, and he was Crying for one drop of Wa|ter to cool his Tongue, then he bitterly Re|pented of all the Drunken Merry-meetings, which <HI>in his Life time</HI> he had seen; but then Re|pentance was too Late. Think seriously on that Scripture, Rom. 13.11, 12, 13. <HI>Now it is high time to wake out of sleep, the night is far spent, the day is at hand; let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, &mdash; Let us walk honestly, not in rioting &amp; d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unkenness, not in chambering &amp; wan|tonness.</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="001570_0058_0FB3DCB3982ED778">
Do not delay your Repe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tance, but NOW Practise it. <HI>Austin</HI> I remember Con|fesseth, That he Lived in scandalous Impieties, in his Vain Youthful Days, before his Conver|sion, and he had many secret Convictions upon his Conscience, thinking with himself that To|morrow, or some time Hereafter, he would Repent of, and Turn from those Vanities: But on a certaim Time it seemed to him as if he heard a Voice from Heaven, saying to him, <HI>Tolle &amp; Lege, Take up and Read</HI>; a Bible be|ing by him, he taketh it up, and goeth to read|ing in it, and the <HI>First</HI> place which his Eyes fixed on, was this Scripure <HI>last</HI> mentioned, and the Lord set in with it upon his Heart, so as that he Cried out, <HI>And why not</HI> Now, <HI>Lord?</HI> I have said, That <HI>Hereafter</HI> I would leave my Chambering and Wantonness, but let me do it <HI>Now,</HI> Lord. Do you that are <HI>Drunkards,</HI> say and do the like; Resolve upon Present Re|pentance, without delaying one Day or one Hour longer. And know for your Encourage|ment, <HI>That in case you do truly Repent of this Ini|quity, God will forgive you.</HI> Do not think that I love to <HI>Scare</HI> you, with the dark Visions of that Eternal Night which is <HI>hastening</HI> upon your Souls. Do not think, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> That I de|light in <HI>Terrifying</HI> you, with the sad Tidings of Hell and Death. Indeed sometimes I am forced to it. <HI>Knowing the Terror of the Lord.</HI> I
<PB N="56" REF="001570_0059_0FB3DCB5207B6E00">
seek to Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">swade you by those Arguments; Nevertheless, I take no Pleasure to Tell you thereof. But now that I am speaking to you of <HI>the Pardoning Grace of GOD,</HI> Me-thinks I could be glad to stay and dwell here, and en|large my self much to you, would <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Strength</HI> permit me. But I can only say thus much. We read in Scripture of those that have been grievously <HI>Guilty of this Sin, many &amp; many a time</HI>; of such as have <HI>Walked in it,</HI> yet when they have <HI>truly Repented of it,</HI> the Gracious Blessed GOD has <HI>freely Forgiven them</HI>; and in <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> looked upon them as if they had never Committed this Sin. To Encourage to <HI>Repentance,</HI> and to break the <HI>Heart of the Vilest Drunkard,</HI> I'll put you in mind of Two Scrip|tures: The one is that, 1 Pet. 4.3. <HI>The time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lascivious|ness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquettings, &amp;c.</HI> So that those <HI>Christians</HI> had afore their Con|version been wofully Guilty of <HI>this Iniquity,</HI> but upon <HI>true Repentance</HI> they were <HI>sprinkled with the Blood of Jesus Christ</HI>; as the beginning of the <HI>Epistle</HI> sheweth: That is to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, The Blood of Jesus Christ Cleansed them from the Guilt of this Sin, and obtained Pardoning Mercy for them. Another Scripture to Encourage you to Repentance is that, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.11. Where the <HI>Apostle</HI> having said to the <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thian,</HI> that
<PB N="57" REF="001570_0060_0FB3DCB697324B20">
no Drunkard (that is, so Living and Dying without Repentance) shall inherit the Kingdom of God; he addeth withal, <HI>Such were some of you: But ye are Washed, you are Sanctified, you are Iustified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</HI> Know therefore, that altho', thou hast been Guilty of this great Sin, it may be an Hundred &amp; an Hundred times, yet thou mayest be Justified from it in the Name of the Lord Jesus, if indeed thou dost Repent of it. But then your Repentance must be thus Quali|fied;</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>You must Mourn before the Lord, that ever you Dishonoured His Name by this Transgression.</HI> Let me speak to you in the words of the Pro|phet <HI>Joel,</HI> Joel 1.5. <HI>Awake ye drunkards, and weep and howl, all ye drinkers of wine.</HI> O thou Drunkard, Now let Tears be thy drink; Go Home, and appear before the Lord in Secret, and there Lament with a sorrowful Heart, that ever thou hast thus Sinned against Him. Do as <HI>David</HI> did, who saith, Psal. 38.18. <HI>I will declare mine Iniquity, I will be sorry for my Sin.</HI> What Sin was that? Truly, his Sin in making <HI>Vria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Drunk. So do thou be sorry that ever thou hast made thy self Drunk.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>You must also Forsake this Sin</HI>: That's implied in true Repentance. And I speak this the rather, because I know there have been some Drunkards that would Bewail their Sin with
<PB N="58" REF="001570_0061_0FB3DCB81747F218">
many Tears, and yet it may be, go &amp; be Drunk again the next Week: That's no true Repen|tance. Thy Heart must be so broken <HI>For</HI> this Sin, as to be broken <HI>From</HI> it; Otherwise tho' a man should Confess his Sin till his Tongue be worn to the stumps, tho' he should Pray against it till Heaven and Earth shake; tho' he should Weep Seas of Tears for it, yet if he will not Forsake it, all his Confessions, Prayers, and Tears shall never Save him. Yea, he must For|sake it not only as to his Conversation, or Out|wardly; but Inwardly, so as to have no Af|fection, or secret Love and Liking to this Abo|mination. O therefore say as once <HI>Ephraim</HI> did; <HI>What have I to do any more with Idols?</HI> So sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thou, What have I to do any more with my wicked Companions in Sin?
