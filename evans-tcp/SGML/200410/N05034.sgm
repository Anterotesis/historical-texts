<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are two Ways of representing and recommending true Religion and Virtue to the World, which GOD hath made Use of: The one is by Doctrine and Precept; the other is by Instance and Example: Both are abundantly used in the <HI>holy Scriptures.</HI> Not only are the Grounds, Nature, Design and Importance of Religion clearly ex|hibited in the Doctrines of Scripture, and it's Exercise and Practice plainly delineated and abundantly enjoin'd and enforc'd in it's Commands and Counsels: But there we have many excellent Examples of Religion, in it's Power and Practice, set before us, in the Histories both of the Old Testament and New &mdash; JESUS CHRIST, the great Prophet of God, when he came into the World to be <HI>the Light of the World,</HI> to teach and enforce true Religion, in a greater Degree than ever had been before, he made Use of both these Methods: In his Doctrine he declared the Mind and Will of God, and the Nature and Properties of that Vertue which becomes Creatures of our Make and in our Circumstances, more clearly and fully than ever it had been before, and more powerfully enforced it by what he declared of the Obligations and Inducements to Holiness; and he also in his own Prac|tice gave a most perfect Example of the Vertue he taught. He exhibited to the World such an illustrious Pattern of Humility, divine Love, discreet Zeal, Self-denial, Obedience, Patience, Resignation, Fortitude,
<PB REF="006311_0003_0000000000000000">
Meekness, Forgiveness, Compassion, Benevolence, and universal Holiness, as neither Men nor Angels ever saw before. God also in his Providence has been wont to make Use of both these Methods to hold forth Light to Mankind, and Inducement to their Duty, in all Ages: He has from Time to Time raised up eminent Teachers, to exhibit and bear Testimony to the Truth in their <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and oppose the Errors, Darkness and Wicked|ness of the World; and also has, from Age to Age, raised up some eminent Persons that have set bright <HI>Ex|amples</HI> of that Religion that is taught and prescribed in the Word of God; whose Examples have in divine Providence been set forth to publick View. These have a great Tendency to engage the Attention of Men to the Doctrines and Rules that are taught, and greatly to confirm and enforce them; and especially when these bright Examples have been exhibited in the same Per|sons that have been eminent <HI>Teachers,</HI> so that the World has had Opportunity to see such a Confirmation of the Truth, Efficacy, and Amiableness of the Religion taught, in the Practice of the same Persons that have most clearly and forceably taught it; and above all, when these bright Examples have been set by eminent Teach|ers in a variety of unusual Circumstances of remarkable <HI>Trial</HI>; and God has withal remarkably distinguish'd them with wonderful <HI>Success</HI> of their Instructions and Labours, consisting in glorious Events that have been in many Respects new and strange.</P>
<P>Such an Instance we have in the <HI>excellent Person,</HI> whose <HI>Life</HI> is published in the following Pages. His Example is attended with a great Variety of Circumstances, tend|ing to engage the Attention of religious People, especi|ally in these Parts of the World: He was one of dis|tinguish'd natural Abilities; as all are sensible, that had Acquaintance with him: He was a Minister of the Gospel, and one who was called to unusual Services in that Work, whose Ministry was attended with very re|markable
<PB N="lii" REF="006311_0004_0000000000000000">
and unusual Events, an Account of which has already been given to the Publick; one whose Course of Religion began before the late Times of extraordinary religious Commotion, but yet one that lived in those Times, and went through them, and was very much in the Way of the various extraordinary Effects and unusual Appearances of that Day, and was not an idle Spectator, but had a near Concern in many Things that pass'd at that Time; one that had a very extensive Acquaintance with those that have been the Subjects of the late reli|gious Operations, in many of these <HI>British</HI> Colonies, in Places far distant one from another, in People of many different Nations, of different Educations, Manners and Customs; one who had peculiar Opportunity of Ac|quaintance with the false Appearances and Counterfeits of Religion: One who himself was the Instrument of a most remarkable Awakening, and an exceeding wonder|ful and abiding Alteration and moral Transformation of such Subjects as do peculiarly render the Change rare and astonishing.</P>
<P>In the following Account, the Reader will have Op|portunity to see, not only what were the external Cir|cumstances and remarkable Incidents of the Life of this Person, and how he spent his Time from Day to Day, as to his external Behaviour; but also what pass'd in his own Heart, the wonderful Change that he experienced in his Mind and Disposition, the Manner in which that Change was bro't to pass, how it continued, what were it's Consequences in his inward Frames, Thoughts, Af|fections and secret Exercises, through many Vicissitudes and Trials, from thenceforth for more than eight Years, 'till his Death; and also to see how all ended at last, in his Sentiments, Frame and Behaviour, during a long Season of the gradual and sensible Approach of Death, under a lingring Illness, and what were the Effects of his Religion in dying Circumstances, or in the last Stages of his dying Illness. The Account being writ|ten,
<PB REF="006311_0005_0000000000000000">
the Reader may have Opportunity at his Leisure to compare the various Parts of the Story, and deliberately to view and weigh the whole, and consider how far what is related is agreeable to the Dictates of right Rea|son and the holy Word of God.</P>
<P>I am far from supposing, that Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s inward Exercises and Experiences, or his external Conduct, were free from all Imperfection: The Example of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is the only Example that ever was set in the human Nature, that was altogether perfect; which therefore is a Rule, to try all other Examples by; and the Disposi|tions, Frames, and Practices of others must be commend|ed and followed no further, than they were <HI>Followers of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>There is one Thing in Mr. <HI>Brainerd,</HI> easily discerna|ble by the following Account of his Life, that may be called an Imperfection in him, which tho' not properly an Imperfection of a moral Nature, yet may possibly be made an Objection against the extraordinary Appearances of Religion and Devotion in him, by such as seek for Objections against every Thing that can be produced in Favour of true vital Religion; and that is, that he was one who by his Constitution and natural Temper was so prone to <HI>Melancholy</HI> and Dejection of Spirit. There are some who think that all serious strict Religion is a melancholy Thing, and that what is called Christian Experience, is little else besides melancholy Vapours disturbing the Brain, and exciting enthusiastical Imagi|nations. But that Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Temper or Consti|tution inclined him to Despondency, is no just Ground to suspect his extraordinary Devotion, as being only the Fruit of a warm Imagination. I doubt not but that all who have well observed Mankind, will readily grant this, that it is not all those who by their natural Constitution or Temper are most disposed to <HI>Dejection,</HI> that are the Persons who are the most susceptive of lively and strong Impressions on their Imagination, or the most subject to
<PB REF="006311_0006_0000000000000000">
those vehement impetuous Affections, which are the Fruits of such Impressions; but that many who are of a very <HI>gay</HI> and <HI>sanguine</HI> natural Temper are vastly more so, and if their Affections are turned into a religious Chan|nel, are much more exposed to <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> than many of the former. And as to Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> in particular, notwithstanding his Inclination to Despondency, he was evidently one of that Sort of Persons who usually are the furthest from a teeming Imagination; being one of a penetrating Genius, of clear Thought, of close Reason|ing, and a very exact Judgment; as all know, that knew him. As he had a great Insight into human Nature, and was very <HI>discerning</HI> and <HI>judicious</HI> in Things in ge|neral, so he excell'd in his Judgment and Knowledge of Things in Divinity, but especially in Things appertaining to inward experimental Religion; most accurately distin|guishing between real solid Piety and Enthusiasm, be|tween those Affections that are rational and scriptural, having their Foundation in Light and Judgment, and those that are founded in whimsical Conceits, strong Impressions on the Imagination, and those vehement Emotions of the animal Spirits that arise from them. He was exceeding sensible of Men's Exposedness to these Things, how much they had prevailed, and what Mul|titudes had been deceived by them, of the pernicious Consequences of them, and the fearful Mischief they had done in the Christian World. He greatly abhor'd such a Sort of Religion, and was abundant in bearing Testi|mony against it, living and dying; and was quick to discern when any Thing of that Nature arose, tho' in it's first Buddings, and appearing under the most fair and plausible Disguises; and had that Talent at describ|ing the various Workings of this <HI>imaginary Enthu|siastical</HI> Religion, evincing the Falseness and Vanity of it, and demonstrating the great Difference between this and true <HI>spiritual</HI> Devotion, which I scarcely ever knew equalled in any other Person. &mdash; And his Judiciousness
<PB REF="006311_0007_0000000000000000">
did not only appear in distinguishing among the Expe|riences of <HI>others,</HI> but also among the various Exercises of <HI>his own Mind</HI>; and particularly in discerning what within himself was to be laid to the Score of <HI>Melancholy</HI>; in which he exceeded all melancholy Persons that ever I was acquainted with (tho' I have been in the Way of Acquaintance with very many;) which was doubtless owing to a peculiar Strength in his <HI>Judgment:</HI> 'Tis a rare Thing indeed, that melancholy People are well sen|sible of their own Disease, and fully convinced that such and such Things are to be ascribed to it, as are indeed it's genuine Operations and Fruits.&mdash; Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> did not obtain that Degree of Skill, which he had in this Matter, at once, but gain'd it gradually; as the Reader may discern by the following Account of his Life. In the former Part of his religious Course, he imputed much of that Kind of Gloominess of Mind and those dark Thoughts, to spiritual <HI>Desertion,</HI> which in the latter Part of his Life, he was abundantly sensible, were owing to the Disease of <HI>Melancholy</HI>; accordingly he often expresly speaks of them in his Diary as arising from this Cause; and he was often in Conversation speak|ing of the Difference between Melancholy and godly Sorrow, true Humiliation and spiritual Desertion, and the great Danger of mistaking the one for the other, and the very hurtful Nature of Melancholy, discoursing with great Judgment upon it, and doubtless much more judiciously for what he knew by his own Experience.</P>
<P>But besides what may be argued from Mr <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Strength of Judgment, 'tis apparent in <HI>Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t,</HI> that he was not a Person of a warm Imagination. His inward Experiences, either in his Convictions or his Conversion, and his religious Views and Impressions thro' the Course of his Life to his Death (of which he has left a very particular Account) none of them consisted in, or were excited by, strong and lively Images formed in his Ima|gination; there is nothing at all appears of it in his
<PB N="vii" REF="006311_0008_0000000000000000">
<HI>Diary,</HI> from Beginning to End: Yes, he told me on his Death Bed, that, altho' once when he was very young in Years and in Experience, he was deceived into a high Opinion of such Things, looking on them as superiour Attainments in Religion, beyond what he had ever arrived to, and was ambitious of them and earnestly sought them, yet he never could obtain them; and that he never in his Life had a strong Impression on his Ima|gination, of any V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sage, outward Form, external Glory, or any other Thing of that Nature; which Kind of Impressions abound among the wild enthusiastic Peo|ple of the late and present Day.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Religious Impressions, Views and Affections in their Nature were vastly different from En|thusiasm, so were then <HI>Effects</HI> in him as contrary as possible to the ordinary Effects of that. Nothing so puffs Men up, as <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> with a high Conceit of their own Wisdom, Holiness, Eminency and Sufficien|cy, and makes 'em so bold, forward, assuming, and arrogant: But the Reader will see, that Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Religion constantly disposed him to a most mean Tho't of himself, an abasing Sense of his own exceeding Sin|fulness, Deficiency, Unprofitableness, and Ignorance; looking on himself as worse than others; disposing him to universal Benevolence, Meekness, and in Honour to prefer others, and to treat all with Kindness and Respect. And when <HI>Melancholy</HI> prevailed, tho' the Effects of it were very prejudicial to him, yet it had not those Effects of <HI>Enthusiasm</HI>; but operated by dark and discouraging Thoughts of himself, as ignorant, wicked and wholly unfit for the Work of the Ministry, or even to be seen among Mankind, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &mdash; Indeed at the Time fore|mentioned, when he had not learn'd well to distinguish between Enthusiasm &amp; solid Religion, he joining and keep|ing Company with some that were tinged with no small Degree of the former, for a Season partook with them in a Degr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of their D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">spositions and Behaviours; tho' as was observed before, he could not obtain those Things
<PB N="viii" REF="006311_0009_0000000000000000">
wherein their <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> it self consisted, and so could not become like 'em in that Respect, however he er|roneously desired and sought it. But certainly it is not at all to be wondered at, that a Youth and a young Convert, one that had his Heart so swallowed up in Re|ligion, and so earnestly desired the flourishing of it, but had had so little Opportunity for Reading, Observation and Experience, should for a while be dazzled and de|ceived with the glaring Appearances of that mistaken Devotion and Zeal; especially considering what the extraordinary Circumstances of that Day were. He told me on his Death-Bed, that while he was in these Cir|cumstances he was out of his Element, and did Violence to himself, while complying, in his Conduct, with Per|sons of a fierce and imprudent Zeal, from his great Veneration of some that he looked upon much better than himself. So that it would be very unreasonable, that his Error at that Time should nevertheless be esteemed a just Ground of Prejudice against the whole of his Re|ligion, and his Character in general; especially consi|dering, how greatly his Mind was soon changed, and how exceedingly he afterwards lamented his Error, and abhor'd himself for his imprudent Zeal and Misconduct at that Time, even to the breaking of his Heart, and al|most to the overbearing and breaking the Strength of his Nature; and how much of a Christian Spirit he shew|ed, in his condemning himself for that Misconduct, as the Reader will see.</P>
<P>What has been now mentioned of Mr. <HI>Brainerd,</HI> is so far from being just Ground of Prejudice against what is related in the following Account of his Life, that, if duly considered, it will render the History the more <HI>Serviceable.</HI> For by his thus joining for a Season with <HI>Enthusiasts,</HI> he had a more full &amp; intimate Acquaintance with what belonged to that Sort of Religion, and so was under better Advantages to judge of the Difference be|tween that, and the other, which he finally approved and strove to his utmost to promote, in Opposition to it:
<PB N="ix" REF="006311_0010_0000000000000000">
And hereby the Reader has the more to demonstrate to him, that Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> in his Testimony against it and the Spirit and Behaviour of those that are influenced by it, speaks from impartial Conviction, and not from Pre|judice; because therein he openly condemns his own for|mer Opinion and Conduct, on Account of which he had greatly suffered from his Opposers, and for which some continued to Reproach him as long as he lived.</P>
<P>Another Imperfection in Mr. <HI>Brainerd,</HI> which may be observed in the following Account of his Life, was his being <HI>excessive in his Labours</HI>; not taking due Care to Proportion his Fatigues to his Strength. Indeed the Case was very often so, and such the seeming Calls of Providence, that it was extremely difficult for him to avoid doing more than his Strength would well admit of; yea, his Circumstances, and the Business of his Mission among the <HI>Indians,</HI> were such, that great Fa|tigues and Hardships were altogether inevitable. How|ever, he was finally convinced, that he had err'd in this Matter, and that he ought to have taken more thoro' Care, and been more resolute to withstand Temptations to such Degrees of Labour as injur'd his Health; and accordingly warned his <HI>Brother,</HI> who succeeds him in his Mission, to be careful to avoid this Error.</P>
<P>Besides the Imperfections already mentioned, it is rea|dily allowed, that there were some Imperfections that ran through his whole Life, and were mixed with all his religious Affections and Exercises, some Mixture of what was natural with that which was spiritual; as it evermore is in the best Saints in this World. Doubtless there was some Influence that natural Temper had in the religious Exercises and Experiences of Mr. <HI>Brainerd,</HI> as there most apparently was in the Exercises of devout <HI>David,</HI> and the Apostles <HI>Peter, John</HI> and <HI>Paul:</HI> There was undoubtedly very often some Influence of his natural Disposition to Dejection in his religious Mourning, some Mixture of Melancholy with truly godly Sorrow and real Christian Humility, and some Mixture of the natural
<PB N="x" REF="006311_0011_0000000000000000">
Fire of Youth with his holy Zeal for God, and some Influence of natural Principles mix'd with Grace in va|rious other Respects, as it ever was and ever will be with the Saints while on this Side Heaven. Perhaps none were more sensible of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Imperfections than he himself; or could distinguish more accurately, than he, between what was natural and what was spiritual. 'Tis easy for the judicious Reader to observe, that his Graces ripen'd, and the religious Exercises of his Heart became more and more pure, and he more and more distinguishing in his Judgment, the longer he liv'd: He had much to teach and purify him, and he failed not to make his Advantage thereby.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding all these Imperfections, I am per|swaded, every pious and judicious Reader will acknow|ledge, that what is here set before him is indeed a re|markable Instance of true and eminent Christian Piety in Heart and Practice; tending greatly to confirm the Reali|ty of vital Religion and the Power of Godliness, most worthy of Imitation, and many Ways tending to the spiritual Benefit of the careful Observer.</P>
<P>'Tis fit, the Reader should be aware, that what Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> wrote in his <HI>Diary,</HI> out of which the following Account of his Life is chiefly taken, was written only for his own private Use, and not to get Honour and Applause in the World, nor with any Design that the World should ever see it, either while he lived or after his Death, excepting some few Things that he wrote in a dying State, after he had been perswaded (with Diffi|culty) not entirely to suppress all his private Writings. He shewed himself almost invincibly averse to the <HI>Pub|lishing</HI> of any Part of his <HI>Diary</HI> after his Death; and when he was thought to be dying at <HI>Boston,</HI> gave the most strict peremptory Orders to the Contrary: but being by some of his Friends there prevailed upon to withdraw so strict and absolute a Prohibition, he was pleased finally to yield so far as that <HI>his Papers should be left in my Hands, that I might dispose of them as I thought would be most for
<PB N="xi" REF="006311_0012_0000000000000000">
God's Glory and the Interest of Religion.</HI>&mdash;But a few Days before his Death, he ordered some Part of his <HI>Diary</HI> to be destroyed (as will afterwards be observed) which ren|ders the Account of his Life the less compleat. And there are some Parts of his <HI>Diary</HI> are here left out for Brevity's Sake, that would (I am sensible) have been a great Ad|vantage to the History, if they had been inserted; par|ticularly the Account of his wonderful Successes among the <HI>Indians</HI>; which for Substance is the same in his pri|vate <HI>Diary</HI> with that which has already been made pub|lick, in the <HI>Journal</HI> he kept by order of the Society in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for their Information. That Account, I am of Opinion, would be more entertaining and more profitable, if it were published as it is written in his <HI>Diary,</HI> in Con|nection with his secret Religion and the inward Exercises of his Mind, and also with the preceeding and following Parts of the Story of his Life. But because that Account has been Published already, and because the adding it here would make the Book much more bulky and more costly, which might tend to discourage the Purchase and Perusal of it, and so render it less extensively useful, I have therefore omitted that Part. However, this Defect may in a great Measure be made up to the Reader, by his purchasing his publick <HI>Journal,</HI> and reading it in its Place, with this History of his Life; which undoubtedly would be well worth the while for every Reader, and would richly recompense the additional cost of the Purchase. I hope therefore, that those of my Readers who are not furnished with <HI>that Book,</HI> will, for their own Profit and Entertainment, and that they may have the Story of this excellent Person more compleat, procure one of those Books; without which he must have a very imperfect View of the most important Part of his Life, and (on some Accounts) of the most remarkable and wonderful Things in it.&mdash;I should also observe, that besides that Book, and antecedent to it, there is a <HI>Narrative</HI> relating to the <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, annexed to Mr. <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s Sermon at Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Ordination; which likewise may the
<PB N="xii" REF="006311_0013_0000000000000000">
more profitably be read in Conjunction with his <HI>Diary</HI> previous to <HI>Nov.</HI> 5. 1744.</P>
<P>But it is Time to end this Preface, that the Reader may be no longer detain'd from the History it self.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Those Parts of the following History, that are included between <HI>Brackets</HI> thus [] are the Words of the <HI>Publisher,</HI> for the most Part, summa|rily representing (for Brevity's Sake) the substance or chief Things contained in Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Diary, for such a certain Space of Time as is there speci|fied: The rest is the Account that he gives of him|self in his private Writings, in his own Words.</P>
<P>I presume, scarce any Reader needs to be told, that [<HI>A. Aet.</HI>] on the top of the Page, signifies <HI>The Year of his Age,</HI> and [A. D.] <HI>The Year of our Lord.</HI></P>

<HEAD>An ACCOUNT Of the LIFE of The Reverend Mr. <HI>David Brainerd.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I. From his <HI>Birth,</HI> to the Time when he began to devote himself to the <HI>Study of Divi|nity,</HI> in order to his being fitted for the Work of the <HI>Ministry.</HI></HEAD>
<P>[MR. <HI>David Brainerd</HI> was born <HI>April</HI> 20. 1718&punc; at <HI>Haddam,</HI> a Town belonging to the County of <HI>Hartford,</HI> in the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> NEW-ENGLAND. His <HI>Father,</HI> who died when this his Son was about nine Years of Age, was the Worshipful <HI>Hezekiah Brainerd</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> an Assistant, or one of his Majesty's Council for that Colony, and the Son of <HI>Daniel Brainerd</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a Justice of the Peace, and a Deacon of the Church of Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ist in <HI>Haddam.</HI> His <HI>Mother</HI> was Mrs. <HI>Dorothy Hobart,</HI> Daughter to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Jeremiah Hobart,</HI> who preach'd a while at <HI>Top<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">field,</HI> and then removed to <HI>Hempstead</HI> on <HI>Long-Island,</HI> and afterwards removed from <HI>Hempstead</HI> (by Reason of Numbers turning Quakers, and many others being so Irreligious,
<PB N="2" REF="006311_0033_0000000000000000">
that they would do nothing towards the Support of the Ministry) and came and settled in the Work of the Ministry at <HI>Haddam:</HI> Where he died in the 85th Year of his Age: Of whom it is remarkable, that he went to the publick Worship in the Forenoon, and died in his Chair between Meetings. And this Rev. Gen|tleman was Son of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Peter Hobart,</HI> who was, first, Minister of the Gospel at <HI>Hingham,</HI> in the County of <HI>Norfolk</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and by Reason of the Persecution of the <HI>Puritans,</HI> re|moved with his Family to <HI>New-England,</HI> and was settled in the Ministry at <HI>Hingham,</HI> in the <HI>Massachusetts.</HI> He had five Sons, viz. <HI>Joshua, Jeremiah, Gersh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, Japheth,</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah.</HI> His Son <HI>Joshua</HI> was Minister at <HI>Southold</HI> on <HI>Long-Island; &mdash; Jeremiah</HI> was Mr. <HI>David Brainerd's</HI> Grandfather, Minister at <HI>Haddam,</HI> &amp;c. as was before observed: <HI>Gershom</HI> was Minister of <HI>Groton</HI> in <HI>Connecticut: Japheth</HI> was a Physician, and went in the Quality of a Doctor of a Ship to <HI>England,</HI> (before the Time for the tak|ing his second Degree at College) and designed to go from thence to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and never was heard of more: <HI>Nehemiah</HI> was sometime Fellow of <HI>Harvard</HI> College, and afterwards Minister at <HI>Newton</HI> in the <HI>Massachusetts.</HI> The Mother of Mrs. <HI>Dorothy Hobart</HI> (who was afterwards <HI>Brainerd</HI>) was Daughter to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Samuel Whiting,</HI> Minister of the Gospel, first at <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> and afterwards at <HI>Lynn</HI> in the <HI>Massachusetts, New-England</HI>: He had three Sons that were Ministers of the Gospel.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>David Brainerd</HI> was the third Son of his Parents. They had five Sons and four Daughters: Their eldest Son is <HI>Hezekiah Brainerd</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a Justice of the Peace, and for several Years past a Representative of the Town of <HI>Haddam,</HI> in the General Assem|bly of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Colony: The second was the Rev. Mr. <HI>Nehemiah Brainerd,</HI> a worthy Minister at <HI>Eastbury</HI> in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> who died of a Consumption <HI>Nov.</HI> 10. 1742. The fourth is Mr. <HI>John Brainerd,</HI> who succeeds his Brother <HI>David,</HI> as Missionary to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and Pastor of the same Church of Christian <HI>In|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ians</HI> in <HI>New-Jersey:</HI> And the fifth was <HI>Israel,</HI> lately Student at <HI>Yale</HI>-College in <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and died since his Brother <HI>David.</HI>&mdash; Mrs. <HI>Dorothy Brainerd</HI> having lived several Years a Widow, died, when her Son, whose Life I am about to give an Account of, was about fourteen Years of Age: So that in his Youth he was left both Fatherless and Motherless.&mdash; What Ac|count he has given of Himself, and his own Life, may be seen in what follows.]</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="006311_0034_0000000000000000">I Was, I think, from my Youth, something sober, and inclined rather to Melancholy, than the contrary Extreme; but don't remember any Thing of Conviction of Sin, worthy of Remark, 'till I was, I believe, about seven or eight Years of Age; when I became something concern'd for my Soul, and terrified at the Thoughts of Death, and was driven to the Performance of Du|ties: But it appeared a melancholy Business, and destroyed my Eagerness for Play. And alas! This religious Concern was but short-lived. However, I sometimes attended secret Prayer; and thus lived at <HI>Ease</HI> in <HI>Zion, without God in the World,</HI> and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h|out much Concern, as I remember, 'till I was above thirteen Years of Age. But sometime in the Winter 1732, I was some|thing roused out of carnal Security, by I scarce know what Means at <HI>first</HI>; but was much excited by the prevailing of a mortal Sickness in <HI>Haddam:</HI> I was frequent, constant and something fervent in Duties, and took Delight in reading, especially Mr. <HI>Janeway's Token for Children</HI>; I felt sometimes much melted in Duties, and took great Delight in the Performance of 'em: And I sometimes hoped, that I was converted, or at least in a good and hopeful Way for Heaven and Happiness, not knowing what Conversion was. The Spirit of God at this Time proceeded far with me; I was remarkably dead to the World, and my Thoughts were almost wholly employed about my Soul's Con|cerns; and I may indeed say, <HI>almost I was perswaded to be a Christian.</HI> I was also exceedingly distressed and melancholy at the Death of my Mother, in <HI>March</HI> 1732. But afterwards my religious Concern began to decline, and I by Degrees fell back into a considerable Degree of Security; tho' I still attended secret Prayer frequently.</P>
<P>About the 15th of <HI>April</HI> 1733, I removed from my Father's House to <HI>East-Haddam,</HI> where I spent four Years, but still <HI>without God in the World</HI>; tho' for the most Part I went a Round of secret Duty. I was not exceedingly addicted to young Com|pany, or Frolicking (as it is called) But this I know, that when I did go into Company, I never returned from a Frolick in my Life, with so good a Conscience as I went with; It always add|ed new Guilt to me, and made me afraid to come to the Throne of Grace, and spoiled those good Frames, I was wont some|times to please my self with. But alas! all my good Frames were but <HI>Self-Righteousness,</HI> not bottomed on a Desire for the Glory of God.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="006311_0035_0000000000000000">About the latter End of <HI>April</HI> 1737, being full 19 Years of Age, I removed to <HI>Durham,</HI> and began to work on my Farm, and so continued the Year out, or near, 'till I was 20 Years old; frequently longing, from a natural Inclination, after a liberal Education. When I was about twenty Years of Age, I applied my self to Study; and sometime before, was more than ordinarily excited to and in Duty: But now engaged more than ever in the Duties of Religion. I became very strict, and watch|ful over my Thoughts, Words, and Actions; and thought I must be sober indeed, because I designed to devote my self to the Ministry; and imagined I did dedicate my self to the Lord.</P>
<P>Some Time in <HI>April</HI> 1738, I went to Mr. <HI>Fiske</HI>'s, and lived with him, during his Life. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Fiske</HI> was the Pastor of the Church in <HI>Haddam.</HI></NOTE> And I remember, He advised me wholly to abandon young Company, and associate myself with grave elderly People: which Counsel I followed; and my Man|ner of Life was now exceeding regular, and full of Religion, such as it was: For I read my Bible more than twice through in less than a Year, I spent much Time every Day in secret Pray|er, and other secret Duties; I gave great Attention to the Word preached, and endeavoured to my utmost to retain it: So much concerned was I about Religion, that I agreed with some young Persons to meet privately on <HI>Sabbath-Evenings</HI> for religious Ex|ercises, and thought my self sincere in these Duties; and after our Meeting was ended, I used to repeat the Discourses of the Day to my self, and recollect what I could, tho' sometimes it was very late in the Night. Again, on <HI>Monday-Mornings,</HI> I used sometimes to recollect the same Sermons. And I had sometimes considerable Movings of Affections in Duties, and much Pleasure, and had many Thoughts of joining to the Church. In short, I had a very good outside, and rested entirely on my Duties, tho' I was not sensible of it.</P>
<P>After Mr. <HI>Fiske</HI>'s Death, I proceeded in my Learning with my Brother; and was still very constant in religious Duties, and often wondered at the Levity of Professors; 'twas a Trouble to me, that they were so careless in religious Matters.&mdash; Thus I proceeded a considerable Length on a <HI>self-righteous</HI> Foundation; and should have been entirely lost and undone, had not the meer Mercy of God prevented.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006311_0036_0000000000000000">Some Time in the Beginning of Winter, <HI>Anno</HI> 1738, it pleased God, on one Sabbath-day Morning, as I was walking out for some secret Duties (as I remember) to give me on a Sudden such a Sense of my Danger and the Wrath of God, that I stood amazed, and my former good Frames, that I had pleased myself with, all presently vanished; and from the View, that I had of my Sin and Vileness, I was much distressed all that Day, fear|ing the Vengeance of God would soon overtake me; I was much dejected, and kept much alone, and sometimes begrutched the Birds and Beasts their Happiness, because they were not exposed to eternal Misery, as I evidently saw I was. And thus I lived from Day to Day, being frequently in great Distress: Sometimes there appeared Mountains before me to obstruct my Hopes of Mercy; and the Work of Conversion appeared so great, I thought I should never be the Subject of it: But used, however, to pray and cry to God, and perform other Duties with great Earnestness, and hoped by some Means to make the Case better. And tho' I Hundreds of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> renounced all Pretences of any <HI>Worth</HI> in my Duties (as I thought) even in the Season of the Performance of them, and often confessed to God that I deserv|ed nothing for the very best of them, but eternal Condemnation: Yet still I had a secret latent Hope of <HI>recommending</HI> my self to God by my religious Duties; and when I prayed affectionately, and my Heart seemed in some Measure to melt, I hoped God would be thereby moved to pity me, my Prayers then look'd with some Appearance of <HI>Goodness</HI> in 'em, &amp; I seemed to <HI>mourn</HI> for Sin: and then I could in some Measure venture on the Mercy of God in Christ (as I tho't;) Tho' the preponderating Thought and Foundation of my Hope was some Imagination of <HI>Goodness</HI> in my Heart Meltings, and Flowing of Affections in Duty, and (sometimes) extraordinary Enlargements therein, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Tho' at some Times the <HI>Gate</HI> appeared so very <HI>strait,</HI> that it look'd next to impossible to <HI>enter,</HI> yet at other Times I flattered my self that it was not so very difficult, and hoped I should by Diligence and Watchfulness soon gain the Point. Sometimes after Enlarge|ment in Duty and considerable Affection, I hoped I had made a <HI>good Step</HI> towards <HI>Heaven,</HI> and imagined that GOD was affected as I was, and that he would hear such <HI>sincere Cries</HI> (as I called them) and so sometimes when I withdrew for secret Duties in great Distress, I returned something comfortable; and thus heal'd my self with my Duties.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="006311_0037_0000000000000000">Some Time in <HI>February</HI> 1738, 9. I set apart a Day for secret Fasting and Prayer, and spent the Day in almost incessant Cries to God for Mercy, that he would open my Eyes to see the Evil of Sin, and the Way of Life by Jesus Christ. And God was pleased that Day to make considerable Discoveries of my <HI>Heart</HI> to me: But still I <HI>trusted</HI> in all the Duties I performed; tho' there was no Manner of <HI>Goodness</HI> in the Duties I then performed, there being no Manner of Respect to the Glory of GOD in them, nor any such Principle in my Heart: yet God was pleased to make my Endeavours that Day, a Means to shew me my <HI>Help|lessness</HI> in some Measure.</P>
<P>Sometimes I was greatly <HI>encouraged,</HI> and imagin'd that God loved me and was pleased with me, and thought I should soon be fully reconciled to God; while the Whole was founded on meer <HI>Presumption,</HI> arising from Enlargement in Duty, or Flow|ing of Affections, or some good Resolutions, and the like. And when, at Times, great Distress began to arise, on a Sight of my Vileness and Nakedness, and Inability to deliver my self from a sovereign God, I used to put off the Discovery, as what I could not bear. Once, I remember, a terrible Pang of Distress seized me, and the Thoughts of renouncing my Self, and standing naked before GOD, stripped of all Goodness, were so dreadful to me, that I was ready to say to 'em as <HI>Felix</HI> to <HI>Paul, Go thy Way for this Time.</HI> Thus, tho' I daily long'd for greater Con|viction of Sin, supposing that I must see more of my dreadful State in order to a Remedy, yet when the Discoveries of my vile hellish Heart were made to me, the Sight was so dreadful, and shewed me so plainly my Exposedness to Damnation, that I could not endure it.&mdash; I constantly strove after whatever <HI>Qualifications,</HI> I imagined others obtained before the Reception of Christ, in order to <HI>recommend</HI> me to his Favour. Sometimes I felt the Power of an <HI>hard Heart,</HI> and supposed it must be <HI>soften'd</HI> before Christ would accept of me; and when I felt any Meltings of Heart, I hoped now the Work was almost done: And hence, when my Distress still remain'd, I was wont to <HI>murmur</HI> at God's Dealings with me; and thought, when others felt their Hearts softened, God shewed them Mercy: But my Distress remained still.</P>
<P>Sometimes I grew <HI>remiss</HI> and <HI>sluggish,</HI> without any great Con|victions of Sin, for a considerable Time together; but after such a Season, <HI>Convictions</HI> sometimes seized me more violently. One Night I remember in particular, when I was walking solitarily Abroad, I had open'd to me such a View of my Sin, that
<PB N="7" REF="006311_0038_0000000000000000">
I feared the Ground would cleave asunder under my Feet, and become my Grave, and send my Soul quick into Hell, before I could get Home. And tho' I was forced to go to Bed, left my Distress should be discovered by others, which I much feared; yet I scarce durst Sleep at all, for I thought it would be a great Wonder if I should be out of Hell in the Morning. And tho' my Distress was sometimes thus great, yet I greatly dreaded the loss of Convictions, and returning back to a State of carnal Security, and to my former Insensibility of impending Wrath; which made me exceeding exact in my Behaviour, lest I should stifle the Motions of God's Spirit. When at any Time I took a View of my Convictions of my own Sinfulness, and thought the Degree of 'em to be considerable, I was wont to trust in my Convictions: But this Confidence, and the Hopes that arose in me from it, of soon making some notable Ad|vances towards Deliverance, would ease my Mind, and I soon became more senseless and remiss: But then again, when I discerned my Convictions to grow languid, and I tho't them about to leave me, this immediately alarmed and distressed me. Sometimes I expected to take a large Step, and get very far to|wards Conversion, by some particular Opportunity or Means I had in View.</P>
<P>The many Disappointments, and great Distresses and Per|plexity I met with, put me into a most <HI>horrible Frame</HI> of <HI>con|testing</HI> with the ALMIGHTY; with an inward Vehemence and Virulence, finding Fault with his Ways of Dealing with Mankind. I found great Fault with the Imputation of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin to his Posterity: And my wicked Heart often wished for some other Way of Salvation, than by <HI>Jesus Christ</HI>: And being <HI>like the troubled Sea,</HI> and my Thoughts confused, I used to con|trive to escape the Wrath of God by some other Means, and had strange Projections, full of Atheism, contriving to disappoint God's Designs and Decrees concerning me, or to escape God's Notice, and hide myself from him: But when, upon Reflec|tion, I saw these Projections were vain, and would not serve me, and that I could contrive nothing for my own Relief, this would throw my Mind into the most horrid Frame, to wish there was <HI>no God,</HI> or to wish there were some other God that could controul him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These Thoughts and Desires were the secret Inclinations of my Heart, that were frequently acting <HI>before I was aware</HI>; but alas, they were <HI>mine!</HI> Altho' I was affrighted with them, when I came to reflect on them: When I considered of it, it distressed me, to think, that my
<PB N="8" REF="006311_0039_0000000000000000">
Heart was so full of <HI>Enmity against God</HI>; and it made me tremble, left God's Vengeance should suddenly fall upon me. I used before, to imagine my Heart was not so bad, as the Scriptures and some other Books represented. Sometimes I used to take much Pains to work it up into a good Frame, a humble submissive Disposition; and hoped there was then some Goodness in me: But it may be on a sudden, the Thoughts of the Strictness of the Law, or the Sovereignty of God, would so irritate the Corruption of my Heart, that I had so watched over, and hoped I had brought to a good Frame, that it would break over all Bounds, and burst forth on all Sides, like Floods of Waters, when they break down their Damm. But being sensible of the Necessity of a deep <HI>Humiliation</HI> in order to a saving Close with Christ, I used to set my self to work in my own Heart those <HI>Convictions,</HI> that were requisite in such an Humiliation: As, a Conviction, that God would be just, if he cast me off for ever: And that if ever God should bestow Mer|cy on me, it would be meer Grace, tho' I should be in Distress <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs first, and be never so much engaged in Duty; that God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not in the least obliged to pity me the more for all past Duties, Cries, and Tears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These Things I strove to my utmost to bring my self to a firm belief of, and hearty assent to; and hoped that now I was brought off from my self, and truly humbled and bowed to the divine Sovereignty; and was wont to tell God in my Prayers, that now I had those very Dispositions of Soul that he required, and on which he shewed Mercy to others, and thereupon to beg and plead for Mercy to me: But when I found no Relief, and was still oppressed with Guilt and Fears of Wrath, my Soul was in a Tumult, and my Heart rose against God, as dealing hardly with me. Yet then my Conscience flew in my Face, putting me in Mind of my late Confession to God of his Justice in my Condemnation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And this, giving me a Sight of the Badness of my Heart, threw me again into Distress, and I wished I had watched my Heart more narrowly, to keep it from breaking out against God's Dealings with me, and I even wished I had not pleaded for Mercy on Account of my Humiliation, because thereby I had lost all my seeming Good|ness.</P>
<P>Thus, Scores of Times, I vainly imagined my self humbled and prepared for saving Mercy.</P>
<P>While I was in this distressed, bewilder'd, and tumultuous State of Mind, the <HI>Corruption</HI> of my Heart was especially <HI>irri|tated</HI> with these Things following:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="9" REF="006311_0040_0000000000000000">1. The <HI>strictness</HI> of the divine <HI>Law.</HI> For I found it was im|possible for me (after my utmost Pains) to answer the Demands of it. I often made new Resolutions, and as often broke them. I imputed the whole to Carelesness, and the Want of being more Watchful, and used to call my self a Fool for my Negligence: But when, upon a stronger Resolution, and greater Endeavours; and close Application of my self to Fasting and Prayer, I found all Attempts fail, then I quarrelled with the Law of God, as unreasonably rigid. I thought, if it extended only to my out|ward Actions and Behaviours, I could bear with it: But I found it condemned me for my evil Thoughts, and Sins of my Heart, which I could not possibly prevent. I was extreamly loth to give out, and own my utter Helplesness in this Matter: But after repeated Disappointments, thought that, rather than perish, I could <HI>do</HI> a little more still, especially if such and such Circumstances might but attend my Endeavours and Strivings; I hoped, that I should strive more earnestly than ever, if the Matter came to Extremity (tho' I never could find the Time to do my utmost, in the <HI>Manner</HI> I intended:) And this Hope of fu|ture more favourable Circumstances, and of doing something great hereafter, kept me from utter Despair in my self, and from seeing my self fallen into the Hands of a sovereign God, and dependent on nothing but free and boundless Grace.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Thing was, that <HI>Faith alone</HI> was the <HI>Condition of Salvation</HI>; and that God would not come down to lower Terms, that he would not promise Life and Salvation upon my sincere and hearty <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Endeavours.</HI> That Word, Mark xvi.16. <HI>He that believeth not, shall be damned,</HI> cut off all Hope there: And I found, <HI>Faith</HI> was the sovereign <HI>Gift of God</HI>; that I could not get it as of my self, and could not oblige God to bestow it upon me, by any of my Performances. (<HI>Eph.</HI> ii.1, &amp; 8.) <HI>This,</HI> I was ready to say, <HI>is a hard Saying; who can hear it?</HI> I could not bear, that all I had done should stand for meer nothing, who had been very Consciencious in Duty, and had been ex|ceeding religious a great while, and had (as I thought) done much more than many others that had obtained Mercy. I con|fess'd indeed the Vileness of my Duties; but then, what made 'em at that Time seem vile, was my wandring Thoughts in them; not because I was all over defiled like a Devil, and the Principle corrupt from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nce they flowed, so that I could not possibly do any Thing that was Good. And therefore I called what I did, by the Name of honest faithful Endeavours; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not bear it, that God had made no Promises of Salvation to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="10" REF="006311_0041_0000000000000000">3. Another Thing was, that I could not find out <HI>what</HI> Faith was; or <HI>what</HI> it was to believe, and <HI>come to Christ.</HI> I read the Calls of Christ, made to the <HI>weary</HI> and <HI>heavy laden</HI>; but could find no <HI>Way,</HI> that he directed them to come in. I thought, I would gladly come, if I knew <HI>how,</HI> tho' the Path of Duty directed to were never so difficult. I read Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI>'s <HI>Guide to Christ</HI> (which I trust was, in the Hand of God, the happy Means of my Conversion) And my Heart rose against the Author; for tho' he told me my very Heart all along under Convictions, and seem'd to be very beneficial to me in his Di|rections; yet here he fail'd, He did not tell me any Thing I could do, that would bring me to Christ, but left me as it were with a great Gulf between me and Christ, without any Directi|on to get through&punc; For I was not yet effectually and experi|mentally taught, that there could be no Way prescribed, where|by a natural Man could, of his own Strength, obtain that which is supernatural, and which the highest Angel cannot give.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another Thing that I found a great inward Opposition to, was the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of GOD. I could not bear, that it should be wholly at God's Pleasure, to save or damn me, just as he would. That Passage, <HI>Rom.</HI> ix.11, &mdash; 23. was a constant Vexation to me, especially <HI>Verse</HI> 21. The reading or meditating on this always destroyed my seeming good Frames: When I thought I was almost humbled, and almost resigned to God's Sovereignty, the reading or thinking on this Passage would make my Enmity against the Sovereignty of God appear. And when I came to reflect on my inward Enmity and Blasphemy, that arose on this Occasion, I was the more afraid of God, and driven further from any Hopes of Reconciliation with him; and it gave me such a dreadful View of my self, that I dreaded more than ever to see myself in God's Hands, and at his sovereign Disposal, and it made me more opposite than ever to submit to his Sovereignty; for I thought God designed my Damnation.&mdash;</P>
<P>All this Time the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God was powerfully at work with me; and I was inwardly pressed to relinquish all <HI>Self-Confidence,</HI> all Hopes of ever helping my self by any Means whatsoever: And the Conviction of my <HI>lost</HI> Estate was sometimes so clear and manifest before my Eyes, that it was as if it had been declared to me in so many Words,
"'Tis done, 'tis done, 'tis forever im|possible to deliver your self."
For about three or four Days, my Soul was thus distressed, especially at some Turns, when for a few Moments I seemed to my self lost and undone; but then
<PB N="11" REF="006311_0042_0000000000000000">
would shrink back immediately from the Sight, because I dared not venture my self into the Hands of God, as wholly helpless, and at the Disposal of his sovereign Pleasure. I dared not see that important Truth concerning my self, That I was <HI>dead in Trespasses and Sins.</HI> But when I had as it were thrust away these Views of my self at any Time, I felt distressed to have the same Discoveries of my self again; for I greatly feared being given over of God to final Stupidity. When I thought of putting it off to a <HI>more convenient Season,</HI> the Conviction was so close and powerful with Regard to the present Time, that it was the best Time, and probably the only Time, that I dared not put it off. It was the Sight of <HI>Truth</HI> concerning my self, <HI>Truth</HI> res|pecting my State, as a Creature fallen and alienated from God, and that consequently could make no Demands on God for Mercy, but must subscribe to the absolute Sovereignty of the divine Be|ing; the Sight of the <HI>Truth,</HI> I say, my Soul shrank away from, and trembled to think of beholding. Thus, <HI>he that doth Evil</HI> (as all unregenerate Men continually do) <HI>hates the Light of Truth,</HI> neither cares to <HI>come to it,</HI> because it will <HI>reprove his Deeds,</HI> and shew him his just Deserts. (<HI>Joh.</HI> iii.20.) And tho', some Time before, I had taken much Pains (as I thought) to submit to the Sovereignty of God, yet I mistook the Thing; and did not once imagine, that seeing and being made experimentally sensible of this Truth, which my Soul now so much dreaded and trembled at a Sense of, was the Frame of Soul that I had been so ear|nest in pursuit of heretofore: For I had ever hoped, that when I had attained to that <HI>Humiliation,</HI> which I supposed necessary to go before Faith, then it would not be fair for God to <HI>cast me off</HI>; but now I saw it was so far from any Goodness in me, to own my self spiritually dead, and destitute of all Goodness, that, on the contrary, <HI>my Mouth</HI> would be forever <HI>stop'd</HI> by it; and it look'd as dreadful to me, to see my self, and the Relation I stood in to God, as a Sinner and a Criminal, and he a great Judge and Sovereign, as it would be to a poor trembling Creature, to ven|ture off some high Precipice. And hence I put it off for a Mi|nute or two, and tried for better Circumstances to do it in; ei|ther I must read a Passage or two, or pray first, or something of the like Nature; or else put off my Submission to God's Sove|reignty, with an Objection, that I did not know how to submit: But the Truth was, I could see no Safety in owning my self in the Hands of a Sovereign God, and that I could lay no Claim to any Thing better than Damnation.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="006311_0043_0000000000000000">But after a considerable Time spent in such like Exercises and Distresses, one Morning, while I was walking in a solitary Place as usual, I at once saw that all my Contrivances and Projections to effect or procure Deliverance and Salvation for my self, were utterly <HI>in vain:</HI> I was brought quite to a stand, as finding my self totally <HI>lost.</HI> I had thought many Times before, that the Difficulties in my Way were very great: But now I saw, in ano|ther and very different Light, that it was forever impossible for me to do any Thing towards helping or delivering my self. I then thought of blaming my self, that I had not done more, and been more engaged, while I had Opportunity (for it seemed now as if the Season of doing was forever over and gone) But I in|stantly saw, that let me have done what I would, it would no more have tended to my helping myself; than what I had done; that I had made all the Pleas, I ever could have made to all Eternity; and that all my Pleas were vain. The <HI>Tumult</HI> that had been before in my Mind, was now <HI>quieted</HI>; and I was some|thing eased of that Distress, which I felt, while struggling a|gainst a Sight of my self, and of the divine Sovereignty. I had the greatest Certainty, that my State was forever miserable, for all that I could do; and wondered, and was almost astonished, that I had never been sensible of it before.</P>
<P>In the Time while I remain'd in this State, <HI>my Notions</HI> res|pecting my <HI>Duties,</HI> were quite different from what I had ever entertained in Times past. Before this, the more I did in Duty, the more I thought God was obliged to me; or at least the more hard I thought it would be for God to cast me off; 'tho at the same Time I confessed, and thought I saw, that there was no Goodness or Merit in my Duties: But now the more I did in Prayer or any other Duty, the more I saw I was indebted to God for allowing me to ask for Mercy; For I saw, it was Self-Interest had led me to pray, and that I had never once prayed from any Respect to the Glory of God. Now I saw, there was no necessary Connection between my Prayers and the Bestow|ment of divine Mercy; that they laid not the least Obligation upon God to bestow his Grace upon me; and that there was no more Vertue or Goodness in them, than there would be in my paddling with my Hand in the Water (which was the Com|parison I had then in my Mind) and this because they were not performed from any Love or Regard to God. I saw, that I had been heaping up my Devotions before God, Fasting, Praying <HI>&amp;c.</HI> pretending, and indeed really thinking, at some Times, that I
<PB N="13" REF="006311_0044_0000000000000000">
was aiming at the Glory of God; whereas I never once truly intended it, but only my own Happiness. I saw, that, as I had never done any Thing <HI>for</HI> God, I had no Claim to lay to any Thing <HI>from</HI> him, but Perdition, on Account of my Hypocrisy and Mockery. Oh how different did my Duties now appear from what they used to do! I used to charge them with Sin and Imperfection; But this was only on Account of the Wandrings and vain Thoughts attending them, and not because I had no Regard to God in them; for this I thought I had: But when I saw evidently that I had Regard to nothing but Self-Interest, then they appeared vile Mockery of God, Self-Worship, and a continual Course of Lies; so that I saw now, there was some|thing worse had attended my Duties, than barely a few Wan|drings &amp;c. For the whole was nothing but Self-Worship and an horrid Abuse of God.</P>
<P>I continued, as I remember, in this State of Mind, from Fri|day-Morning 'till the Sabbath-Evening following, <HI>July</HI> 12. 1739. when I was walking again in the same solitary Place where I was brought to see my self lost and helpless (as was before men|tion'd) and here, in a mournful melancholy State, was attempt|ing to pray; but found no Heart to engage in that, or any other Duty; my former Concern and Exercise and religious Affecti|ons were now gone. I thought, the Spirit of God had quite left me; but still was not distressed: Yet disconsolate, as if there was nothing in Heaven or Earth could make me happy. And having been thus endeavouring to pray (tho' being, as I thought, very stupid and senseless) for near half an Hour, (and by this Time the Sun was about half-an-hour-high, as I remember) then, as I was walking in a dark thick Grove, <HI>unspeakable Glory</HI> seemed to open to the View and Apprehension of my Soul: I don't mean any external Brightness, for I saw no such Thing, nor do I intend any Imagination of a Body of Light, some where away in the third Heavens, or any Thing of that Nature; but it was a new inward Apprehension or View that I had of <HI>GOD,</HI> such as I never had before, nor any Thing which had the least Resemblance of it. I stood still, and wonder'd and ad|mired! I knew that I never had seen before any Thing com|parable to it for Excellency and Beauty: It was widely different from all the Conceptions&punc; that ever I had had of God, or Things divine. I had no particular Apprehension of any one Person in the Trinity, either the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost; but it appeared to be <HI>divine Glory,</HI> that I then beheld: And my
<PB N="14" REF="006311_0045_0000000000000000">
Soul <HI>rejoyced with Joy unspeakable,</HI> to see such a GOD, such a glorious divine Being; and I was inwardly pleased and satisfied, that he should be <HI>God over all</HI> forever and ever. My Soul was so captivated and delighted with the Excellency, Loveliness, Greatness, and other Perfections of GOD, that I was even swallowed up in <HI>Him</HI>; at least to that Degree, that I had no Thought (as I remember) at <HI>first,</HI> about my own Salvation, and scarce reflected there was such a Creature as my self.</P>
<P>Thus God, I trust, brought me to a hearty Disposition to <HI>exalt him,</HI> and set him on the Throne, and principally and ultimately to aim at his Honour and Glory, as King of the Universe.</P>
<P>I continued in this State of inward Joy and Peace, yet Astonishment, 'till near Dark, without any sensible Abatement; and then began to think and examine what I had seen; and felt sweetly <HI>composed</HI> in my Mind all the Evening following: I felt myself in a new World, and every Thing about me ap|peared with a different Aspect from what it was wont to do.</P>
<P>At this Time, the <HI>Way of Salvation</HI> opened to me with such infinite Wisdom, Suitableness and Excellency, that I wondered I should ever think of any other Way of Salvation; was a|mazed, that I had not drop'd my own Contrivances, and com|plied with this lovely blessed and excellent Way before. If I could have been saved by my own Duties, or any other Way that I had formerly contrived, my whole Soul would now have refused. I wonder'd, that all the World did not see and comply with this Way of Salvation, intirely by the <HI>Righteousness of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>The sweet Relish of what I then felt, continued with me for several Days, almost constantly, in a greater or less Degree: I could not but sweetly rejoyce in God, lying down and ri|sing up. The next <HI>Lords-Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> I felt something of the same Kind; tho' not so powerful as before. But, not long after, was again involved in <HI>thick Darkness,</HI> and under great Distress: yet not of the same Kind with my Distress under Convictions. I was guilty, afraid and ashamed to come before God, was exceedingly press'd with a Sense of Guilt: But it was not long before I felt (I trust) true Repentance and Joy in God.</P>
<P>About the latter End of <HI>August,</HI> I again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> under great Dark|ness; It seem'd as if the Presence of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as <HI>clean gone forever.</HI> Tho' I was not so much d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stressed about my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">iritual State, as I was at my being shut out from God's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> I then sensi|bly was.

<P><PB N="15" REF="006311_0046_0000000000000000">In the Beginning of <HI>September</HI> I went to <HI>College</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Yale College in <HI>New-Haven.</HI></NOTE>, and entred there: But with some Degree of Reluctancy, fearing lest I should not be able to lead a Life of strict Religion, in the midst of so many Temptations.&mdash; After this, in the Vacancy, before I went to tarry at College, it pleased God to visit my Soul with clearer Manifestations of himself and his Grace. I was spending some Time in Prayer, &amp; Self-Examination; and the Lord by his Grace so shined into my Heart, that I enjoyed full Assurance of his Favour, for that Time; and my Soul was unspeakably refreshed with divine and heavenly Enjoyments. At this Time especially, as well as some others, sundry Passages of God's <HI>Word</HI> open'd to my Soul with divine Clearness, Power and Sweetness, so as to appear exceeding precious, and with clear and certain Evidence of it's being <HI>the Word of God.</HI> I enjoy'd considerable Sweetness in Religion all the Winter following.</P>
<P>In <HI>Jan.</HI> 1739, 40. The <HI>Measles</HI> spread much in College; and I having taken the Distemper, went home to <HI>Haddam:</HI> But some Days before I was taken Sick, I seem'd to be greatly deserted, and my Soul mourned the Absence of the <HI>Comforter</HI> exceeding|ly: It seem'd to me, all Comfort was forever gone; I pray'd and cried to God for Help, yet found no present Comfort or Relief. But thro' divine Goodness, a Night or two before I was taken Ill, while I was walking alone in a very retired Place, and engaged in Meditation and Prayer, I enjoyed a sweet re|freshing Visit, as I trust, from above, so that my Soul was raised far above the Fears of <HI>Death</HI>; indeed I rather longed for Death, than feared it. O how much more refreshing this one Season was, than all the Pleasures and Delights that Earth can afford! After a Day or two I was taken with the Measles, and was very Ill indeed, so that I almost despaired of Life: But had no dis|tressing Fears of Death at all. However thro' divine Goodness I soon recovered: Yet, by Reason of hard and close Studies, and being much exposed on Account of my Freshman-ship, I had but little Time for spiritual Duties; my Soul often mourned for Want of more Time and Opportunity to be alone with God. In the Spring and Summer following I had better Advantages for Retirement, and enjoyed more Comfort in Religion: Tho' indeed my Ambition in my Studies greatly wronged the Activity and Vigour of my spiritual Life: Yet this was usually the Case with me, that <HI>in the Multitude of my Thoughts within me, God's Comforts</HI> principally <HI>delighted my Soul:</HI> These were my greatest Consolations Day by Day.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="006311_0047_0000000000000000">One Day I remember in particular (I think it was in <HI>Jun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> 1740.) I walked to a considerable Distance from the College, in the Fields alone at Noon, and in Prayer found such unspeak|able Sweetness and Delight in God, that I thought, if I must continue still in this evil World, I wanted always to be there, to behold God's Glory: My Soul dearly loved all Mankind, and longed exceedingly that they should enjoy what I enjoyed.&mdash; It seem'd to be a little Resemblance of Heaven.</P>
<P>On Lord's-Day, <HI>July</HI> 6. being Sacrament-Day, I found some divine Life and spiritual Refreshment in that holy Ordinance. When I came from the Lord's Table, I wondered how my Fel|low-Students could live as I was sensible most did. &mdash; Next Lord's-Day <HI>July</HI> 13. I had some special Sweetness in Religion.&mdash; Again Lord's-Day <HI>July</HI> 20. my Soul was in a sweet and preci|ous Frame.</P>
<P>Sometime in <HI>August</HI> following, I became so weakly and disordered, by too close Application to my Studies, that I was advised by my <HI>Tutor</HI> to go Home, and disengage my Mind from Study, as much as I could; for I was grown so Weak, that I began to spit Blood. I took his Advice, and endeavoured to lay aside my Studies. But being brought very low, I look'd Death in the Face more stedfastly; and the Lord was pleased to give me renewedly a sweet Sense and Relish of divine Things; and particularly in <HI>October</HI> 13, I found divine Help and Consolation in the precious Duties of secret Prayer and Self Examination, and my Soul took Delight in the blessed God:&mdash;so likewise on the 17th of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>Saturday <HI>October</HI> 18. in my Morning-Devotions, my Soul was exceedingly melted for and bitterly mourned over my ex|ceeding <HI>Sinfulness</HI> and <HI>Vileness.</HI> I never before had felt so pun|gent and deep a Sense of the odious Nature of Sin, as at this Time. My Soul was then unusually carry'd forth in <HI>Love</HI> to God, and had a lively Sense of God's Love to me. And this Love and Hope, at that Time, cast out Fear. Both Morning and Even|ing I spent some Time in Self-Examination, to find the Truth of Grace, as also my Fitness to approach to God at his Table the next Day; and through infinite Grace, found the holy Spirit influencing my Soul with Love to God, as a <HI>Witness within my self.</HI></P>
<P>Lord's-Day <HI>October</HI> 19. In the Morning, I felt my Soul <HI>hun|gring and thirsting after Righteousness.</HI> In the Fore-Noon, while I was looking on the Sacramental Elements, and thinking that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> would soon be <HI>set forth crucified before me,</HI> my Soul
<PB N="17" REF="006311_0048_0000000000000000">
was fill'd with Light and Love, so that I was almost in an Ex|tasy; my Body was so weak, I could scarcely stand. I felt at the same Time an exceeding Tenderness and most fervent Love towards all Mankind; so that my Soul and all the Powers of it seemed, as it were, to melt into Softness and Sweetness. But in the Season of the Communion there was some Abatement of this sweet Life and Fervour. This Love and Joy cast out Fear; and my Soul longed for perfect Grace and Glory. This swe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Frame continued 'till the Evening, when my Soul was sweetly spiritual in secret Duties.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>October</HI> 20. I again found the sweet Assistance of the holy Spirit in secret Duties, both Morning and Evening, and Life and Comfort in Religion through the whole Day.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>October</HI> 21. I had likewise Experience of the Good|ness of God in <HI>shedding abroad his Love in my Heart,</HI> and giv|ing me Delight and Consolation in religious Duties. And all the remaining Part of the Week, my Soul seemed to be taken up with divine Things. I now so longed after God, and to be freed from Sin, that when I felt myself recovering, and thought I must return to College again, which had proved so hurtful to my spiritual Interest the Year past, I could not but be grieved, and I thought I had much rather have died; for it distress'd me, to think of getting away from God. But before I went, I enjoyed several other sweet and precious Seasons of Communion with God (particularly <HI>October</HI> 30. and <HI>Nov.</HI> 4.) wherein my Soul enjoyed unspeakable Comfort.</P>
<P>I returned to College about <HI>November</HI> 6. and through the Goodness of God felt the Power of Religion almost daily, for the Space of six Weeks.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 28. In my Evening-Devotion, I enjoyed precious Discoveries of God, and was unspeakably refreshed with that Passage <HI>Heb.</HI> xii.22, 23, 24. That my Soul longed to wing away for the Paradise of God; I longed to be conformed to God in all Things.&mdash; A Day or two after, I enjoyed much of the <HI>Light of God's Countenance,</HI> most of the Day; and my Soul rested in God.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>December</HI> 9. I was in a comfortable Frame of Soul most of the Day; but especially in Evening-Devotions, when God was pleased wonderfully to assist and strengthen me; so that I thought nothing should ever move me from the Love of God in Christ Jesus my Lord.&mdash;O! <HI>one Hour with God</HI> infinite|ly exceeds all the Pleasures and Delights of this lower World.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="006311_0049_0000000000000000">Sometime towards the latter End of <HI>January</HI> 1740, 41. I grew more <HI>cold</HI> and <HI>dull</HI> in Matters of Religion, by Means of my old Temptation, <HI>viz.</HI> Ambition in my Studies.&mdash; But thro' divine Goodness, a great and general <HI>Awakening</HI> spread it self over the College, about the latter End of <HI>February,</HI> in which I was much quickned, and more abundantly engaged in Religion.</P>
<P>[This Awakening here spoken of, was at the Beginning of that extraordinary religious Commotion through the Land, which is fresh in every one's Memory. This Awakening was for a Time very great and general at <HI>New-Haven</HI>; and the <HI>College</HI> had no small Share in it: That Society was greatly re|formed, the Students in general became serious, and many of them remarkably so, and much engaged in the Concerns of their eternal Salvation. And however undesirable the Issue of the Awakenings of that Day have appear'd in many others, there have been manifestly happy and abiding Effects of the Impressi|ons then made on the Minds of many of the Members of that College. And by all that I can learn concerning Mr. <HI>Brainerd,</HI> there can be no Reason to doubt but that he had much of God's gracious Presence, and of the lively Actings of true Grace, at that Time: But yet he was afterwards abundantly sensible, that his religious Experiences and Affections at that Time were not free from a corrupt Mixture, nor his Conduct to be acquitted from many Things that were imprudent and blameable; which he greatly lamented himself, and was willing that others should forget, that none might make an ill Improvement of such an Ex|ample. And therefore altho' in the Time of it, he kept a con|stant <HI>Diary,</HI> containing a very particular Account of what pass'd from Day to Day, for the next thirteen Months, from the latter End of <HI>January,</HI> 1740, 41. foremention'd, in two small Books, which he called the two first Volumes of his Diary, next following the Account before given of his Convictions, Conversion, and consequent Comforts; yet, when he lay on his Death-Bed, he gave Order (unknown to me, 'till after his Death) that these two Volumes should be destroyed, and in the Begin|ning of the third Book of his Diary, he wrote thus, (by the Hand of another, he not being able to write himself)
<Q>The two preceeding Volumes, immediately following the Account of the Author's Conversion, are lost. If any are desirous to know how the Author lived, in general, during that Space of Time, let them read the first thirty Pages of this Volume; where they will find something of a Specimen of his ordinary Man|ner
<PB N="19" REF="006311_0050_0000000000000000">
of living, through that whole Space of Time, which was about 13 Months; excepting that here he was more refined from some <HI>Imprudencies</HI> and <HI>indecent Heats,</HI> than there; but the Spirit of Devotion running through the whole, was the same.</Q></P>
<P>It could not be otherwise than that One whose Heart had been so prepared and drawn to God, as Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s had been, should be mightily enlarged, animated and engaged, at the Sight of such an Alteration made in the College, the Town and Land, and so great an Appearance of Men's reforming their Lives, and turning from their Profaneness and Immorality, to Seriousness and Concern for their Salvation, and of Religion's reviving and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ourishing almost every where. But as an intemperate impru|dent Zeal, and a Degree of Enthusiasm soon crept in, and ming|led it self with that Revival of Religion; and so great and gene|ral an Awakening being quite a new Thing in the Land, at least as to all the living Inhabitants of it; neither People nor Ministers had learn'd thoroughly to distinguish between solid Religion and its delusive Counterfeits; even many Ministers of the Gospel, of long standing and the best Reputation, were for a Time over|powered with the glaring Appearances of the latter: And there|fore surely it was not to be wondered at, that young <HI>Brainerd,</HI> but a Sophimore at College, should be so; who was not only young in Years, but very young in Religion and Experience, and had had but little Opportunity for the Study of Divinity, and still less for Observation of the Circumstances and Events of such an extraordinary State of Things: A Man must divest him|self of all Reason, to make strange of it. In these disadvantagious Circumstances, <HI>Brainerd</HI> had the Unhappiness to have a Tincture of that intemperate indiscreet Zeal, which was at that Time too prevalent; and was led, from his high Opinion of others that he looked upon better than himself, into such Errors as were really contrary to the habitual Temper of his Mind. One In|stance of his Misconduct at that Time, gave great Offence to the Rulers of the College, even to that Degree that they expell'd him the Society; which it is necessary should here be particular|ly related, with it's Circumstances.</P>
<P>In the Time of the Awakening at College, there were several religious Students that associated themselves one with another for mutual Conversation and Assistance in spiritual Things, who were wont freely to open themselves one to another, as special
<PB N="20" REF="006311_0051_0000000000000000">
and intimate Friends: <HI>Brainerd</HI> was one of this Company. And it once happened, that he and two or three more of these his intimate Friends were in the Hall together, after Mr. <HI>Whittelsey,</HI> one of the Tutors, had been to Prayer there with the Scholars; no other Person now remaining in the Hall, but <HI>Brainerd</HI> and these his Companions. Mr. <HI>Whittelsey</HI> having been unusually pathetical in his Prayer, one of <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Friends on this Oc|casion asked him what he thought of Mr. <HI>Whittelsey</HI>; He made Answer, <HI>He has no more Grace than this Chair.</HI> One of the Freshmen happening at that Time to be near the Hall (tho' not in the Room) over-heard those Words of his; tho' he heard no Name mention'd, and knew not who the Person was, which was thus censured: He informed a certain Woman that belonged to the Town, withal telling her his own Suspicion, <HI>viz.</HI> that he believ'd <HI>Brainerd</HI> said this of some one or other of the Rulers of the College. Whereupon she went &amp; informed the Rector, who sent for this Freshman and examined him; and he told the Rector the Words that he heard <HI>Brainerd</HI> utter, and informed him who were in the Room with him at that Time. Upon which the Rector sent for them: They were very backward to inform against their Friend, of that which they look'd upon as private Conversation, and especially as none but they had heard or knew of whom he had uttered those Words; yet the Rector compell'd them to declare what he said, and of whom he said it.&mdash; <HI>Brainerd</HI> look'd on himself greatly abused in the Manage|ment of this Affair; and thought, that what he said in private, was injuriously extorted from his Friends, and that then it was injuriously required of him (as it was wont to be of such as had been guilty of some open notorious Crime) to make a publick Confession, and to humble himself before the whole College in the Hall, for what he had said only in private Conversation.&mdash; He not complying with this Demand, and having gone once to the separate Meeting at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> when forbidden by the Rector, and also having been accused by one Person of saying concerning the Rector, that he wondered he did not expect to drop down dead for fining the Scholars who followed Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> to <HI>Milford,</HI> tho' there was no Proof of it (and Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> ever profess'd that he did not remember his saying any Thing to that Purpose) for these Things he was expell'd the College.</P>
<P>Now, how far the Circumstances and Exigences of that Day might justify such great Severity in the Governors of the College, I will not undertake to determine; it being my Aim, not to
<PB N="21" REF="006311_0052_0000000000000000">
bring Reproach on the Authority of the College, but only to do Justice to the Memory of a Person who I think to be eminently one of those whose <HI>Memory is blessed.</HI> &mdash; The Reader will see, in the Sequel of the Story of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Life, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Particularly under the Date, <HI>Wednesday,</HI> Sept. 14. 1743.</NOTE> what his own Thoughts afterwards were of his Behaviour in these Things, and in how Christian a Manner he conducted himself, with Res|pect to this Affair; tho' he ever, as long as he lived, supposed himself much abused, in the Management of it, and in what he suffer'd in it.</P>

<HEAD>PART II. From about the Time that he first began to devote himself more especially to the <HI>Study of Divinity,</HI> 'till he was examined and licensed to <HI>preach,</HI> by the Association of Ministers belonging to the Eastern Dis|trict of the County of <HI>Fairfield</HI> in <HI>Con|necticut.</HI></HEAD>
<P>[MR. <HI>Brainerd,</HI> the Spring after his Expulsion, went to live with the Rev.

<P>Here (at Mr. <HI>Mills</HI>'s) he began the third Book of his Diary&punc; in which the Account he wrote of himself, is as follows.]</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>April</HI> 1. 1742. I seem to be declining with Respect to my Life &amp; Warmth in divine Things: Had not so free Access to God in Prayer, as usual of late. O that God would humble me deeply in the Dust before him. I deserve Hell every Day, for not loving my Lord more, <HI>who has</HI> (I trust) <HI>loved me and given himself for me</HI>; and every Time I am enabled to exercise any Grace renewedly, I am renewedly indebted to the God of all Grace for special Assistance. <HI>Where then is Boasting?</HI> Surely <HI>it is excluded,</HI> when we think how we are dependent on God for the Being and every Act of Grace. Oh, if ever I get to Heaven, it will be because God will, and nothing else; for I never did any thing of my self, but get away from God! My Soul will be astonished at the unsearchable Riches of divine Grace, when I arrive at the Mansions, which the blessed Saviour is gone be|fore to prepare.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="006311_0054_0000000000000000">Friday, <HI>April</HI> 2. In the Afternoon I felt something sweetly in secret Prayer, much resigned, calm and serene. What are all the Storms of this lower World, if <HI>Jesus</HI> by his Spirit does but come <HI>walking on the Seas!</HI> &mdash;Some Time past, I had much Plea|sure in the Prospect of the <HI>Heathens</HI> being brought home to Christ, and desired that the Lord would improve <HI>me</HI> in that Work:&mdash;But now my Soul more frequently desires to die, <HI>to be with Christ.</HI> O that my Soul were wrapt up in divine Love, and my longing Desires after God increased.&mdash; In the Evening, was refresh'd in Prayer, with the Hopes of the Advancement of Christ's Kingdom in the World.</P>

I thought, if God would take me to himself now, my Soul would exceedingly rejoyce. O that I may be always humble and resign'd to God, and that God would cause my Soul to be more fix'd on himself, that I may be more fitted both for doing and suffering.</P>
<P>Lords-Day, <HI>April</HI> 4. My Heart was wandring and lifeless.&mdash; In the Evening God gave me Faith in Prayer, and made my Soul melt in some Measure, and gave me to taste a divine Sweet|ness.&mdash; O my blessed God! Let me climb up near to him, and love, and long, and plead, and wrestle, and reach, and stretch after him, and for <HI>Deliverance from the Body of Sin and Death.</HI>&mdash; Alas, my Soul mourn'd to think I should ever lose Sight of it's Beloved again! O <HI>come, Lord</HI> JESUS! <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>[On the Evening of the <HI>next</HI> Day, he complains that he seem'd to be void of all Relish of divine Things, felt much of the Prevalence of Corruption, and saw in himself a Disposition to all Manner of Sin; which brought a very great Gloom on his Mind, and cast him down into the Depths of Melancholy; so that he speaks of himself, as astonished, amazed, having no Comfort, being filled with Horror, seeing no Comfort in Hea|ven or Earth.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>April</HI> 6. I walked out this Morning to the same Place where I was last Night, and felt something as I did then; But was something relieved by reading some Passages in my Diary, and seem'd to feel as if I might pray to the great God again with Freedom; but was suddenly struck with a Damp, from the Sense I had of my own Vileness.&mdash; Then I cry'd to God to wash my Soul and cleanse me from my exceeding Filthiness, to give me Repentance and Pardon; and it began to be some|thing sweet, to pray:&mdash; And I could think of undergoing the
<PB N="24" REF="006311_0055_0000000000000000">
greatest Sufferings in the Cause of Christ, with Pleasure; and found my self willing (if God should so order it) to suffer Ba|nishment from my native Land, among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> that I might do something for their Souls Salvation, in Distresses and Deaths of any Kind.&mdash; Then God gave me to wrestle earnestly for others, for the Kingdom of Christ in the World, and for dear Christian Friends.&mdash; I felt wean'd from the World and from my own Reputation amongst Men, willing to be despised, and to be a gazing Stock for the World to behold.&mdash; 'Tis im|possible for me to express how I then felt: I had not much Joy, but some Sense of the Majesty of God, which made me as it were tremble: I saw my self mean and vile, which made me more willing that God should do what he would with me; it was all infinitely reasonable.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>April</HI> 7. I had not so much Fervency, but felt something as I did Yesterday-Morning, in Prayer:&mdash; At Noon I spent some Time in secret, with some Fervency, but scarce any Sweetness: And felt very dull in the Evening.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>April</HI> 8.&mdash; Had raised Hopes to Day respecting the <HI>Heathen.</HI> O that God would bring in great Numbers of 'em to Jesus Christ. I can't but hope I shall see that glorious Day.&mdash; Every Thing in this World seems exceeding vile and little to me: I look so to my self.&mdash;I had some little Dawn of Comfort to Day in Prayer: But especially to Night I think I had some Faith and Power of Intercession with God, was enabled to plead with God for the Growth of Grace in my self; and many of the dear Children of God then lay with Weight upon my Soul. Blessed be the Lord. 'Tis good to wrestle for divine Blessings.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>April</HI> 9. Most of my Time in Morning-Devotion was spent without sensible Sweetness; yet I had one delightful Prospect of arriving at the heavenly World. I am more amaz'd than ever at such Thoughts; for I see my self infinitely vile and unworthy. I feel very heartless and dull; and tho' I long for the Presence of God, and seem constantly to reach towards God in Desires, yet I can't feel that divine and heavenly Sweet|ness that I used to enjoy.&mdash;No poor Creature stands in Need of divine Grace more than I, and none abuse it more than I have done, and still do.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>April</HI> 10. Spent much Time in secret Prayer this Morning, and not without some Comfort in divine Things, and I hope had some Faith in Exercise: But am so low, and feel so little of the sensible Presence of God, that I hardly know what to call Faith, and am made to <HI>possess the Sins of my Youth,</HI> and

the dreadful Sin of my Nature, and am all Sin; I can't think, nor act, but every Motion is Sin. &mdash; I feel some faint Hopes, that God will, of his infinite Mercy, return again with Showers of converting Grace to poor Gospel-abusing Sinners; and my Hopes of being improved in the Cause of God, which of late have been almost extinct, seem now a little revived. O that all my late Distresses and awful Apprehensions might prove but Christ's School, to make me fit for greater Service, by learning me the great Lesson of Humility.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>April</HI> 11. In the Morning, felt but little Life, excepting that my Heart was something drawn out in Thankful|ness to God for his amazing Grace and Condescension to me in past Influences and Assistances of his Spirit. &mdash; Afterwards had some Sweetness in the Thoughts of arriving at the heavenly World. O for the happy Day!&mdash; After publick Worship God gave me special Assistance in Prayer; I wrestled with my dear Lord, with much Sweetness; and Intercession was made a sweet and delightful Employment to me.&mdash;In the Evening, as I was viewing the <HI>Light in the North,</HI> was delighted in Contemplation on the glorious Morning of the Resurrection.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>April</HI> 12. This Morning the Lord was pleas'd to <HI>lift up the Light of his Countenance upon me</HI> in secret Prayer, and made the Season very precious to my Soul. And tho' I have been so depress'd of late, respecting my Hopes of future <HI>Servi|ceableness</HI> in the Cause of God; yet now I had much En|couragement respecting that Matter. I was specially assisted to interceed and plead for poor Souls, and for the Enlargement of Christ's Kingdom in the World, and for special Grace for my self, to fit me for special Services. I felt exceeding calm, and quite resign'd to God, respecting my future Improvement, <HI>when</HI> and <HI>where</HI> he pleased: My Faith lifted me above the World, and removed all those Mountains, that I could not look over of late: I thought I wanted not the Favour of Man to lean upon; for I knew Christ's Favour was infinitely better, and that it was no Matter <HI>when,</HI> nor <HI>where,</HI> nor <HI>how</HI> Christ should send me, nor what Trials he should still exercise me with, if I might be prepared for his Work &amp; Will. I now found sweetly revived in my Mind the wonderful Discovery, of infinite <HI>Wisdom</HI> in all the Dispensations of God towards me, which I had a lit|tle before I met with my great Trial at College: every Thing appear'd full of the <HI>Wisdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>April</HI> 13. Saw my self to be very mean and vile; wondered at those that shewed me Respect. Afterwards was

something comforted in secret Retirement, and was assisted to wrestle with God, with some Power, Spirituality and Sweetness. Blessed be the Lord, he is never unmindful of me, but always sends me needed Supplies, and from Time to Time, when I am like one dead, raises me to Life. O that I may never distrust infinite Goodness.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>April</HI> 14. My Soul longed for Communion with Christ, and for the Mortification of indwelling Corruption, es|pecially spiritual Pride.

<P>Friday &amp; Saturday, <HI>April</HI> 16, 17. Seldom prayed without some sensible Sweetness and Joy in the Lord. Sometimes I longed much <HI>to be dissolved and to be with Christ.</HI> O that God would enable me to <HI>grow in Grace</HI> every Day. Alas, my Bar|renness is such, that God might well say, <HI>Cut it down.</HI>&mdash;I am afraid of a dead Heart on the Sabbath now begun: O that God would quicken me by his Grace.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day <HI>April</HI> 18. Retir'd early this Morning into the Woods for Prayer; had the Assistance of God's Spirit, and Faith in Exercise, and was enabled to plead with Fervency for the Advancement of Christ's Kingdom in the World, and to interceed for dear absent Friends.&mdash; At Noon, God enabled me to wrestle with him, and to feel (as I trust) the Power of divine Love in Prayer.&mdash; At Night, saw my self infinitely in|debted to God, and had a View of my Short-comings: It seem'd to me, that I had done as it were nothing for God, and that I never had <HI>lived to him</HI> but a few Hours of my Life.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>April</HI> 19. I set apart this Day for Fast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g &amp; Prayer to God for his Grace, especially to prepare me for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Work of the <HI>Ministry,</HI> to give me divine Aid and Direction in my Prepa|rations for that great Work, and in his own Time to <HI>send me into his Harvest.</HI> Accordingly, in the Morning, endeavoured to plead for the divine Presence for the Day, and not without some Life. In the Forenoon, I felt a Power of Intercession for precious immortal Souls, for the Advancement of the Kingdom of my dear Lord and Saviour in the World; and withal, a most sweet Resignation, and even Consolation and Joy in the Tho'ts
<PB N="27" REF="006311_0058_0000000000000000">
of suffering Hardships, Distresses, and even Death it self, in the Promotion of it; and had special Enlargement in pleading for the Enlightning and Conversion of the poor <HI>Heathen.</HI> In the Afternoon, GOD <HI>was with me of a Truth.</HI> O 'twas blessed Company indeed! God enabled me so to agonize in Prayer, that I was quite wet with Sweat, tho' in the Shade, and the Wind cool. My Soul was drawn out very much for <HI>the World</HI>; I grasp'd for <HI>Multitudes</HI> of Souls. I think, I had more Enlarge|ment for Sinners, than for the Children of God; tho' I felt as if I could spend my Life in Cries for both. I enjoyed great Sweetness in Communion with my dear Saviour. I think, I never in my Life felt such an intire Weanedness from this World, and so much resign'd to God in every Thing.&mdash;O that I may always live <HI>to</HI> and <HI>upon</HI> my blessed God. Amen, Amen.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>April</HI> 20. This Day I am twenty-four Years of Age. O how much Mercy have I received the Year past!&mdash; How often has <HI>God caused his Goodness to pass before me!</HI> And how poorly have I answered the Vows I made this Time twelve-month, to be wholly <HI>the Lord's,</HI> to be forever devoted to his Service! The Lord help me to live more to his Glory for Time to come.&mdash; This has been a sweet, a happy Day to me: Blessed be God. I think, my Soul was never so drawn out in Inter|cession for <HI>others,</HI> as it has been this Night. Had a most fer|vent Wrestle with the Lord to Night for my <HI>Enemies</HI>; and I hardly ever so longed to <HI>live to God,</HI> and to be altogether de|voted to him; I wanted to wear out my Life in his Service and for his Glory.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>April</HI> 21. Felt much Calmness and Resignation, and God again enabled me to wrestle for Numbers of Souls, and had much Fervency in the sweet Duty of Intercession.&mdash; I en|joy of late more Sweetness in <HI>Intercession</HI> for others, than in any other Part of Prayer. My blessed Lord really let me <HI>come near to him, and plead with him.</HI></P>
<P>[The Frame of Mind, and Exercises of Soul, that he ex|presses the three Days next following, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, are much of the same Kind with those express'd the two Days past.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day <HI>April</HI> 25. This Morning spent about two Hours in secret Duties, and was enabled more than ordinarily to ago|nize for immortal Souls; tho' it was early in the Morning, and
<PB N="28" REF="006311_0059_0000000000000000">
the Sun scarcely shined at all, yet my Body was quite wet with Sweat. Felt much press'd now, as frequently of late, to plead for the Meekness and Calmness of <HI>the Lamb of God</HI> in my Soul: Thro' divine Goodness felt much of it this Morning. O 'tis a sweet Disposition, heartily to forgive all <HI>Injuries</HI> done us; to wish our greatest <HI>Enemies</HI> as well as we do our own Souls! Blessed Jesus, may I daily be more and more conformed to Thee. At Night was exceedingly melted with divine Love, and had some feeling Sense of the Blessedness of the upper World. Those Words hung upon me, with much divine Sweetness, Psal. lxxxiv.7. <HI>They go from Strength to Strength, every one of them in</HI> Zion <HI>appeareth before God.</HI> O the <HI>near Access,</HI> that God some|times gives us in our Addresses to him! This may well be termed <HI>appearing before God:</HI> 'Tis so indeed, in the true spiritual Sense, and in the sweetest Sense.&mdash;I think I have not had such Power of Intercession, these many Months, both for God's Children, and for dead Sinners, as I have had this Evening. I wished and longed for <HI>the Coming of my dear Lord:</HI> I long'd to join the Angelick Hosts in Praises, wholly free from Imper|fection. O the blessed Moment hastens! All I want is to be more holy, more like my dear Lord. O for Sanctification! My very Soul pants for the compleat Restoration of the blessed Image of my sweet Saviour; that I may be fit for the blessed Enjoyments and Employments of the heavenly World.</P>
<L>Farewell, <HI>vain World;</HI> my Soul can bid Adieu:</L>
<L>My <HI>SAVIOUR</HI>'s taught me to abandon you.</L>
<L>Your Charms may gratify a sensual Mind;</L>
<L>Not please a Soul wholly for <HI>GOD</HI> design'd.</L>
<L>Forbear t'entice, cease then my Soul to call:</L>
<L>'Tis fix'd, through Grace; my <HI>GOD</HI> shall be my <HI>All.</HI></L>
<L>While he thus lets me heavenly Glories view,</L>
<L>Your Beauties fade, my Heart's no Room for you.</L>
<P>The Lord refreshed my Soul with many sweet Passages of his Word. O the <HI>New Jerusalem!</HI> My Soul longed for it. O the Song of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>the Lamb!</HI> And that blessed Song, that no Man can learn, but they that are <HI>redeemed from the Earth!</HI> And the glorious <HI>white Robes,</HI> that were given to <HI>the Souls under the Altar!</HI></P>
<L>Lord, I'm a <HI>Stranger</HI> here alone;</L>
<L><HI>Earth</HI> no true Comforts can afford:</L>
<L>Yet, absent from my dearest One,</L>
<L>My Soul delights to cry, <HI>My Lord!</HI></L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="006311_0060_0000000000000000"><HI>JESUS,</HI> my Lord, my only Love,</L>
<L>Possess my Soul, nor thence depart:</L>
<L>Grant me kind Visits, heavenly Dove;</L>
<L>My God shall then have all my Heart.</L>
<P>Monday, <HI>April</HI> 26. Continued in a sweet Frame of Mind; but in the Afternoon felt something of spiritual Pride stirring. God was pleased to make it a humbling Season at first; tho' afterwards he gave me Sweetness. O my Soul exceedingly longs for that blessed State of Perfection of Deliverance from all Sin!&mdash;At Night, God enabled me to give my Soul up to him, to cast my self upon him, to be ordered and disposed of according to his sovereign Pleasure; and I enjoyed great Peace and Consolation in so doing. My Soul took sweet Delight in God to Night: My Thoughts freely and sweetly centred in him. O that I could spend every Moment of my Life to his Glory.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>April</HI> 27. Retir'd pretty early so secret Devotions; and in Prayer God was pleased to pour such ineffable Comforts into my Soul, that I could do nothing for some Time but say over and over, <HI>O my sweet Saviour! O my sweet Saviour! Whom have I in Heaven, but Thee? and there is none upon Earth, that I desire beside Thee.</HI> If I had had a Thousand Lives, my Soul would gladly have laid 'em all down at once to have been <HI>with</HI> CHRIST. My Soul never enjoyed so much of Heaven before; 'twas the most refined and most spiritual Season of Communion with God I ever yet felt: I never felt so great a Degree of Resignation in my Life: I felt very sweetly all the Forenoon.&mdash; In the Afternoon I withdrew to meet with my God, but found my self much declined, and God made it a humbling Season to my Soul: I mourned over <HI>the Body of Death,</HI> that is in me: it grieved me exceedingly, that I could not pray to and praise God with my Heart full of divine heavenly Love.&mdash; O that my Soul might never offer any dead cold Services to my God.&mdash; In the Evening had not so much sweet divine <HI>Love,</HI> as in the Morning; but had a sweet Season of fervent <HI>Intercession.</HI></P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>April</HI> 28. Withdrew to my usual Place of Re|tirement in great Peace and Tranquillity, and spent about two Hours in secret Duties. I felt much as I did Yesterday-Morning, only weaker and more overcome. I seemed to hang and depend wholly on my dear Lord; wholly wean'd from all other Depen|dances. I knew not what to say to my God, but only <HI>lean on his Bosom,</HI> as it were, &amp; breathe out my Desires after a perfect Con|formity to him in all Things. Thirsting Desires &amp; insatiable Long|ings
<PB N="30" REF="006311_0061_0000000000000000">
possessed my Soul, after perfect Holiness: God was so preci|ous to my Soul, that the World with all its Enjoyments was in|finitely vile: I had no more Value for the Favour of Men, than for Pebbles: The LORD was my ALL; and <HI>He</HI> over-ruled all; which greatly delighted me. I think, my Faith and Depen|dance on God scarce ever rose so high. I saw Him such a Foun|tain of Goodness, that it seem'd impossible I should distrust him again, or be any Way anxious about any Thing that should happen to me. I now enjoyed great Sweetness in praying for absent Friends, and for the Enlargement of Christ's Kingdom in the World.&mdash;Much of the Power of these divine Enjoyments remained with me thro' the Day.&mdash;In the Evening my Heart seem'd sweetly to melt, &amp; I trust, was really humbled for indwel|ling Corruption, and I <HI>mourned like a Dove.</HI> I felt that all my Unhappiness arose from my being a Sinner; for with Resignation I could bid Welcome all other Trials; but Sin hung heavy upon me; for God discovered to me the Corruption of my Heart: so that I went to Bed with a heavy Heart, because I was a Sinner; tho' I did not in the least doubt of God's Love. O that God would <HI>purge away my Dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ss, and take away my Tin,</HI> and make me seven Times refined.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>April</HI> 29. Was kept off at a Distance from God;&mdash; but had some Inlargement in Intercession for precious Souls.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>April</HI> 30. Was something dejected in Spirit: No|thing grieves me so much, as that I cannot live constantly to God's Glory. I could bear any Desertion or spiritual Conflicts, if I could but have <HI>my Heart</HI> all the while <HI>burning within me</HI> with Love to God and Desires of his Glory: But this is im|possible; for when I <HI>feel</HI> these, I can't be dejected in my Soul, but only <HI>rejoyce in my Saviour,</HI> who has delivered me from the reigning Power, and will shortly deliver me from the Indwelling of Sin.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>May</HI> 1. Was enabled to cry to God with Fervency for ministerial Qualifications, and that God would appear for the Advancement of his own Kingdom, and that he would bring in the <HI>Heathen</HI> World, &amp;c. Had much Assistance in my Studies.&mdash;This has been a profitable Week to me; I have en|joyed many Communications of the blessed Spirit in my Soul.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>May</HI> 2. God was pleased this Morning to give me such a Sight of my self, as made me appear very vile in my own Eyes: I felt Corruption stirring in my Heart, which I could by no Means suppress: felt more and more deserted: was ex|ceeding weak, and almost sick with my inward Trials.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="006311_0062_0000000000000000">Monday, <HI>May</HI> 3. Had a Sense of vile Ingratitude. In the Morning I withdrew to my usual Place of Retirement, and mourned for my Abuse of my dear Lord: spent the Day in Fasting and Prayer: God gave me much Power of wrestling for his Cause and Kingdom: And it was a happy Day to my Soul. God was with me all the Day, and I was more above the World, than ever in my Life.</P>
<P>[Through the remaining Part of this Week, he complains almost every Day of Desertion and inward Trials and Conflicts, attended with dejection of Spirit; but yet speaks of Times of Relief and Sweetness, and daily refreshing Visits of the divine Spirit, affording special Assistance and Comfort, and enabling, at some Times, to much Fervency and Enlargement in religious Duties.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>May</HI> 9. I think, I never felt so much of the cursed Pride of my Heart, as well as the Stubbornness of my Will before. Oh dreadful! what a vile Wretch I am! I could not submit to be nothing, and to lie down in the Dust! Oh that God would humble me in the Dust. I felt my self such a Sinner, all Day, that I had scarce any Comfort. Oh, when shall I be <HI>delivered from the Body of this Death!</HI> I greatly fear'd, lest thro' Stupidity and Carelesness I should lose the Benefit of these Trials. O that they might be sanctified to my Soul. Nothing seemed to touch me but only this, that I was a Sinner. &mdash; Had Fervency and Refreshment in social Prayer in the Evening.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>May</HI> 10. Rode to <HI>New-Haven</HI>; saw some Christian Friends there; had Comfort in joining in Prayer with them, and hearing of the Goodness of God to them since I last saw them.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>May</HI> 11. Rode from <HI>New-Haven</HI> to <HI>Weathersfield</HI>; was very dull most of the Day; had little Spirituality in this Journey, tho' I often longed to be alone with God; was much perplex'd with vile Thoughts; was sometimes afraid of every Thing: But GOD was <HI>my Helper.</HI>&mdash; Catch'd a little Time for Retirement in the Evening, to my Comfort and Rejoycing. Alas, I can't live in the midst of a Tumult! I long to enjoy God alone.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>May</HI> 12. Had a distressing View of the Pride and Enmity and Vileness of my Heart.&mdash; Afterwards had sweet Refreshment in conversing, &amp; worshipping God, with Christian Friends.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="006311_0063_0000000000000000">Thursday, <HI>May</HI> 13. Saw so much of the Wickedness of my Heart, that I longed to get away from my self. I never before thought, there was so much spiritual Pride in my Soul: I felt almost press'd to Death with my own Vileness. Oh, what <HI>a Body of Death</HI> is there in me! <HI>Lord, deliver my Soul.</HI> I could not find any convenient Place for Retirement, and was greatly exercised.&mdash;Rod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to <HI>Hartford</HI> in the Afternoon: had some Re|freshment and Comfort in religious Exercises with Christian Friends; but longed for more Retirement. O the closest Walk with God is the sweetest Heaven, that can be enjoy'd on Earth!</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>May</HI> 14. Waited on a Council of Ministers con|vened at <HI>Hartford,</HI> and spread before them the Treatment I had met with from the Rector and Tutors of <HI>Yale-College</HI>; who thought it adviseable to interceed for me with the Rector and Trustees, and to intreat them to restore me to my former Pri|vileges in College. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Application which was then made on his Behalf, had not the desired Success.</NOTE> &mdash; After this, spent some Time in reli|gious Exercises with Christian Friends.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>May</HI> 15. Rode from <HI>Hartford</HI> to <HI>Hebron</HI>; was something dejected on the Road; appeared exceeding vile in my own Eyes, saw much Pride and Stubbornness in my Heart. Indeed I never saw such a Week before, as this; for I have been almost ready to die with the View of the Wickedness of my Heart. I could not have thought I had such <HI>a Body of Death</HI> in me. Oh that God would <HI>deliver my Soul.</HI></P>
<P>[The three next Days (which he spent at <HI>Hebron, Lebanon,</HI> and <HI>Norwich</HI>) he complains still of Dulness and Desertion, and expresses a Sense of his Vileness, and longing to hide himself in some Cave or Den of the Earth: But yet speaks of some Inter|vals of Comfort and Soul-Refreshment each Day.]</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>May</HI> 19. [At <HI>Millington</HI>] I was so amazingly deserted this Morning, that I seem'd to feel a Sort of Horror in my Soul. Alas, when God withdraws, what is there that can afford any Comfort to the Soul!</P>
<P>[Through the eight Days next following, he expresses more Calmness and Comfort, and considerable Life, Fervency and Sweetness in Religion.]</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="006311_0064_0000000000000000">Friday, <HI>May</HI> 28. [At <HI>New-Haven</HI>] I think, I scarce ever felt so calm in my Life; I rejoyced in Resignation, and giving my self up to God, to be wholly and intirely devoted to him forever.</P>
<P>[On the three following Days, there was, by the Account he gives, a Continuance of the same excellent Frame of Mind, last expressed: But it seems not to be altogether to so great a Degree.]</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>June</HI> 1. Had much of the Presence of God in Family-Prayer, and had some Comfort in Secret. I was greatly refreshed from the Word of God, this Morning, which appear'd exceeding sweet to me: some Things that appear'd mysterious, were opened to me. O that the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of the dear Saviour might come <HI>with Power,</HI> and the healing <HI>Waters of the Sanctuary</HI> spread far and wide for <HI>the Healing of the Nations.</HI>&mdash;Came to <HI>Ripton</HI>; but was very weak: However, being visited by a Number of young People in the Evening, I pray'd with them.</P>
<P>[The remaining Part of this Week, he speaks of being much diverted and hindered in the Business of Religion, by great Weakness of Body, and necessary Affairs, that he had to at|tend, and complains of having but little Power in Religion; But signifies, that God hereby shewed him, He was like a help|less Infant cast out in the open Field.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>June</HI> 6.&mdash; I feel much deserted: But all this teaches me my Nothingness and Vileness more than ever.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>June</HI> 7. Felt still powerless in secret Prayer.&mdash; Afterwards I pray'd, and conversed, with some little Life. God feeds me with <HI>Crumbs:</HI> Blessed be his Name fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any Thing. I felt a great Desire, that all God's People might know how mean and little and vile I am; that they might see I am nothing, that so they may pray for me aright, and not have the least Dependance upon me.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>June</HI> 8. I enjoyed one sweet and precious Season this Day: I never felt it so sweet to be nothing, and less than nothing, and to be accounted nothing.</P>
<P>[The three next Days he complains of Desertion, and Want of fervency in Religion; but yet his Diary shews that every Day his Heart was engaged in Religion, as his great and as it were only Business.]</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="006311_0065_0000000000000000">Saturday, <HI>June</HI> 12. Spent much Time in Prayer, this Morn|ing, and enjoyed much Sweetness: &mdash; Felt insatiable Longings after God, much of the Day: I wonder'd how poor Souls do to live, that have <HI>no God.</HI>&mdash; The World, with all its Enjoy|ments, quite vanished. I see my self very helpless: but I have a blessed GOD, to go to. I long'd exceedingly <HI>to be dissolved, and to be with Christ,</HI> to <HI>behold his Glory.</HI> Oh, my weak weary Soul longs to arrive at <HI>my Father</HI>'s <HI>House!</HI></P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>June</HI> 13. Felt something calm and resigned in the publick Worship: At the Sacrament saw my self very vile and worthless. O that I may always lie low in the Dust. My Soul seemed steadily to go forth after GOD, in longing Desires to live upon him.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>June</HI> 14. Felt something of the Sweetness of Com|munion with God, and the <HI>constraining</HI> Force of <HI>his Love</HI>: How admirably it captivates the Soul, and makes all the Desires and Affections to center in GOD!&mdash;I set apart this Day for se|cret Fasting and Prayer, to intreat God to direct and bless me with Regard to the great Work I have in View, of <HI>Preaching the Gospel</HI>; and that the Lord would return to me and <HI>shew me the Light of his Countenance.</HI> Had little Life and Power in the Forenoon: Near the middle of the Afternoon, God enabled me to wrestle ardently in Intercession for absent Friends:&mdash;But just at Night, the Lord visited me marvellously in Prayer; I think, my Soul never was in such an Agony before: I felt no Restraint; for the Treasures of divine Grace were opened to me: I wrestled for absent Friends, for the Ingathering of Souls, for Multitudes of poor Souls, and for many that I thought were the Children of God, personally, in many distant Places. I was in such an Agony, from Sun half an Hour high, 'till near Dark, that I was all over wet with Sweat; but yet it seem'd to me that I had wasted away the Day, and had done nothing. Oh, my dear JESUS did <HI>sweat Blood</HI> for poor Souls! I long for more Com|passion towards them.&mdash; Felt still in a sweet Frame, under a Sense of divine Love and Grace; and went to Bed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch a Frame, with my Heart set on GOD.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>June</HI> 15. Had the most ardent Longings after GOD, that ever I felt in my Life: At Noon, in my secret Re|tirement, I could do nothing but tell my dear Lord, in a sweet Calm, that he knew I longed for nothing but <HI>Himself,</HI> nothing but <HI>Holiness</HI>; That <HI>He</HI> had given me these De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">res, and He <HI>only</HI> could give me the Thing desired. I never seem'd to be so unhinged from my self, and to be so wholly devoted to God.
<PB N="35" REF="006311_0066_0000000000000000">
My Heart was swallowed up in GOD, most of the Day. In the Evening I had such a View of the Soul's being as it were enlarged, to contain more Holiness, that my Soul seem'd ready to separate from my Body, and stretch to obtain it. I then wrestled in an Agony for divine Blessings; had my Heart drawn out in Prayer for some Christian Friends, beyond what I ever had before.&mdash;I feel differently now from what ever I did under any sweet En|joyments before, more engaged to <HI>live to GOD</HI> for ever, and less pleased with my own Frames: I am not satisfied with my Frames, nor feel at all more easy after such sweet Strugglings than before; for it seems far too little, if I could always be so. Oh, how short do I fall of my Duty in my sweetest Moments!</P>
<P>[In his Diary for the two next Days, he expresses something of the same Frame, but in a fat less Degree. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here end the 30 first Pages of the third Volume of his Diary, which he speaks of in the Beginning of this Volume (as was observed before) as containing a Specimen of his ordinary Manner of living, thro' the whole Space of Time, from the Beginning of those two Volumes that were destroy'd.</NOTE>]</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>June</HI> 18. Considering my great Unfitness for the Work of the <HI>Ministry,</HI> my present Deadness, and total Inability to do any Thing for the Glory of God that Way, feeling my self very helpless, and at a great Loss <HI>what the Lord would have me to do,</HI> I set apart this Day for Prayer to God, and spent most of the Day in that Duty; but amazingly deserted, most of the Day: yet I found God graciously near, once in particular, while I was pleading for more Compassion for immortal Souls, my <HI>Heart</HI> seem'd to be <HI>open'd</HI> at once, and I was enabled to cry with great Ardency, for a few Minutes.&mdash;Oh, I was distress'd, to think, that I should offer such dead cold Services to the <HI>living God!</HI> My Soul seem'd to breathe after Holiness, a Life of constant Devotedness to God. But I am almost lost sometimes in the pursuit of this Blessedness, and ready to sink, because I continually fall short and miss of my Desire. O that the Lord would help me to hold out, yet a little while, 'till the happy Hour of Deliverance comes.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>June</HI> 19. Felt much disordered; my Spirits were very low: but yet enjoyed some Freedom and Sweetness in the Duties of Religion. Blessed be God.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="006311_0067_0000000000000000">Lord's-Day, <HI>June</HI> 20.

In the Evening, was sweetly composed and resigned to God's Will; was enabled to leave my self and all my Concerns with Him, and to have my whole Dependance upon Him: my secret Retirement was very refreshing to my Soul: It appeared such a Happiness to have God for my Portion, that I had rather be any other Creature in this lower Creation, than not come to the Enjoyment of God: I had rather be a Beast, than a Man, without God, if I were to live here to Eternity, Lord, endear thy self more to me.</P>
<P>[In his Diary for the next seven Days, he expresses a variety of Exercises of Mind: He speaks of great Longings after God and Holiness, and earnest Desires for the Conversion of others, of Fervency in Prayer, and Power to wrestle with God, and of Composure, Comfort and Sweetness, from Time to Time; but expresses a Sense of the vile Abomination of his Heart, and bitterly complains of his Barrenness, and the pressing <HI>Body of Death</HI>; and says, he <HI>saw clearly, that whatever he enjoyed, better than Hell, was free Grace:</HI> Complains of his being ex|ceeding low, much below the Character of a Child of God&punc; and is sometimes very disconsolate and dejected.]</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>June</HI> 30. Spent this Day alone in the Woods, in Fasting and Prayer; underwent the most dreadful Conflicts in my Soul, that ever I felt, in some Respects: I saw my self so vile, that I was ready to say, <HI>I shall now perish by the Hand of</HI> Saul..&mdash;I thought, and almost concluded, I had no Power to stand for the Cause of God, but was almost <HI>afraid of the shaking of a Leaf.</HI> Spent almost the whole Day in Prayer, incessantly.

<P>Friday, <HI>July</HI> 2. Felt composed in secret Prayer&punc; in the Morn|ing.&mdash; My Desires sweetly ascended to God this Day, as I was travelling: and was comfortable in the Evening. Blessed be God for all my Consolations.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>July</HI> 3. My Heart seemed again to sink. The Dis|grace I was laid under at <HI>College,</HI> seemed to damp me, as it opens the Mouths of Opposers. I had no Refuge but in GOD only. Blessed be his Name, that I may go to <HI>Him</HI> at all Times, and find him a <HI>present Help.</HI></P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>July</HI> 4. Had considerable Assistance. In the E|vening, I withdrew and enjoyed a happy Season in secret Prayer: God was pleased to give me the Exercise of Faith, and thereby brought the invisible and eternal World near to my Soul; which appear'd sweetly to me. I hoped, that my weary <HI>Pilgrimage</HI> in the World would be <HI>short,</HI> and that it would not be long before I was brought to my heavenly Home and Father's House: I wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sweetly resigned to God's Will, to tarry his Time, to do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Work, and suffer his Pleasure. I felt <HI>Thankfulness</HI> to God for all my pressing <HI>Desertions</HI> of late; for I am perswaded, they have been made a Means of making me more humble, and much more resign'd. I felt pleased, to be <HI>little,</HI> to be <HI>nothing,</HI> and to <HI>lie in the Dust.</HI> I enjoy'd Life and sweet Consolation in plead|ing for the dear Children of God, and the Kingdom of Christ in the World: and my Soul earnestly breathed after Holiness and the Enjoyment of God. <HI>O come Lord</HI> JESUS! <HI>Come quickly. Amen.</HI></P>
<P>[By his Diary for the remaining Days of this Week, it appears that he enjoyed considerable Composure and Tranquillity, and had Sweetness and Fervency of Spirit in Prayer, from Day to Day.]</P>
<P>Lords-Day, <HI>July</HI> 11. Was deserted and exceeding dejected in the Morning.&mdash; In the Afternoon, had some Life and Assistance, and felt resigned: I saw my self exceeding vile.</P>

<P>Wednesday, <HI>July</HI> 14. Felt a Kind of humble resigned Sweet|ness: Spent a considerable Time in Secret, giving my self up wholly to the Lord.&mdash; Heard Mr. <HI>Bellamy</HI> preach, towards Night: felt very Sweetly, part of the Time: Longed for nearer <HI>access to</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>[The four next Days, he expresses considerable Comfort and Fervency of Spirit in Christian Conversation and Religious Exer|cises.]</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>July</HI> 19. My Desires seem especially to be carried out after Weanedness from the <HI>World,</HI> perfect Deadness to it, and to be even <HI>crucified</HI> to all its Allurements. My Soul longs to fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l it self more of a <HI>Pilgrim</HI> and <HI>Stranger</HI> here below; that nothing may divert me from pressing through the lonely Desart, 'till I arrive at my Father's House.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>July</HI> 20. It was sweet, to give away my self to GOD, to be disposed of&punc; at his Pleasure; and had some feeling Sense of the Sweetness of being a <HI>Pilgrim on Earth.</HI></P>
<P>[The next Day, he expresses himself as determined to be wholly devoted to God; and it appears by his Diary, that he spent the whole Day in a most diligent Exercise of Religion, and exceed|ing comfortably.]</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>July</HI> 22. Journeying from <HI>Southbury</HI> to <HI>Ripton,</HI> called at a House by the Way, where being very kindly entertain'd and refresh'd, I was fill'd with Amazement and Shame, that God should stir up the Hearts of any to shew so much Kindness to such a <HI>dead Dog</HI> as I; was made sensible, in some Measure, how exceeding vile it is, not to be wholly devoted to God. I wonder'd, that God would suffer any of his Creatures to feed and sustain me, from Time to Time.</P>
<P>[In his Diary for the six next Days, are expressed various Exercises and Experiences, such as sweet Composure and Fer|vency of Spirit in Meditation and Prayer, Weanedness from the World, being sensibly a Pilgrim and Stranger on the Earth, Engagedness of Mind to spend every Inch of Time for God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>July,</HI> 29. Was examined by the Association met at <HI>Danbury,</HI> as to my Learning, and also my Experiences in Re|ligion, and received a Licence from them to preach the Gospel of Christ.&mdash; Afterwards felt much devoted to God; join'd in Prayer with one of the Ministers, my peculiar Friend, in a convenient Place; went to Bed resolving to live devoted to God all my Days.</P>

<P>Saturday, <HI>July</HI> 31. Exceeding calm and composed, and was greatly refreshed and encouraged.</P>
<P>[It appears by his Diary, that he continued in this Sweetness and Tranquillity, almost through the whole of the next Week.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Aug.</HI> 8.

<P><PB N="40" REF="006311_0071_0000000000000000">Thursday, <HI>August</HI> 12. This Morning and last Night was ex|ercised with sore inward Trials: I had no Power to pray; but seemed shut out from God. I had in a great Measure lost my Hopes of God's sending me among the <HI>Heathen</HI> afar off, and of seeing them flock home to Christ. I saw so much of my hellish Vileness, that I appear'd worse to my self, than any Devil: I wonder'd, that God would let me live, and wondered that Peo|ple did not stone me, much more, that they would ever hear me preach! It seem'd as tho' I never could nor should preach any more, yet about 9 or 10 o'Clock, the People came over, and I was forced to preach: And blessed be God, he gave me his Pre|sence and Spirit in Prayer and Preaching: So that I was much assisted, and spake with Power from <HI>Job</HI> xiv.14. Some <HI>Indians</HI> cry'd out in great Distress, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was in a Place near <HI>Kent,</HI> in the Western Borders of <HI>Con|necticut,</HI> where there is a Number of <HI>Indians.</HI></NOTE> and all appear'd greatly concerned. After we had pray'd and exhorted them to seek the Lord with Constancy, and hired an <HI>English</HI> Woman to keep a Kind of <HI>School</HI> among them, we came away about one o'Clock, and came to <HI>Judea,</HI> about 15 or 16 Miles. There God was pleased to visit my Soul with much Comfort. Blessed be the Lord for all Things I meet with.</P>
<P>[It appears, that the two next Days he had much Comfort, and had his Heart much engaged in Religion.]</P>
<P>Lords-Day, <HI>August</HI> 13. Felt much Comfort and Devotedness to God this Day. At Night, it was refreshing, to get alone with GOD and <HI>pour out my Soul.</HI> O, who can conceive of the Sweet|ness of Communion with the blessed God, but those that have Experience of it! Glory to God forever, that I may taste Hea|ven below.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>August</HI> 16. Had some Comfort in secret Prayer, in the Morning:&mdash; Felt sweetly sundry Times in Prayer this Day: But was much perplexed in the Evening with vain Conversation.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>August</HI> 17. Exceedingly depress'd in Spirit. It cuts and wounds my Heart, to think how much <HI>Self-Exaltation, Spi|ritual Pride,</HI> &amp; <HI>Warmth of Temper,</HI> I have <HI>formerly</HI> had interming|led with my Endeavours to promote God's Work: And some|times I long to lie down at the Feet of Opposers, and confess what a poor imperfect Creature I have been and still am.&mdash; Oh, the

<P>Wednesday, <HI>August</HI> 18. Spent most of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Day in Prayer and Reading.&mdash; I see so much of my own extream Vileness, that I feel ashamed and guilty before God and Man: I look, to my self, like the vilest Fellow in the Land: I wonder, that God stirs up his People to be so kind to me.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>August</HI> 19. This Day, being about to go from Mr. <HI>Bellamy</HI>'s at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> where I had resided some Time, pray'd with him, and two or three other Christian Friends, and gave our selves to God with all our Hearts, to be his for ever&punc; Eternity look'd very near to me, while I was praying. If I never should see these Christians again in this World, it seem'd but a few Moments before I should meet 'em in another World.&mdash; Parted with them sweetly.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>August</HI> 20. I appeared so vile to my self, that I hardly dared to think of being seen, especially on Account of spiritual Pride. However, to Night, I enjoyed a sweet Hour alone with God [at <HI>Ripton</HI>] I was lifted above the Frowns and Flatteries of this lower World, had a sweet Relish of heavenly Joys, and my Soul did as it were get into the eternal World, and really taste of Heaven. I had a sweet Season of Intercession for dear Friends in Christ; and God helped me to cry fervently for <HI>Zion.</HI> Blessed be God for this Season.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>August</HI> 21. Was much perplex'd, in the Morning.&mdash; Towards Noon enjoyed more of God in secret, was enabled to see that it was best to throw my self into the Hands of God, to be disposed of according to his Pleasure, and rejoyced in such Thoughts. In the Afternoon, rode to <HI>New-Haven</HI>; was much confused all the Way.&mdash; Just at Night, underwent such a dread|ful Conflict, as I have scarce ever felt. I saw my self exceed|ing vile and unworthy; so that I was guilty, and ashamed, that any Body should bestow any Favour on me, or shew me any Respect.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>August</HI> 22. In the Morning, continued still in Perplexity.&mdash; In the Evening, enjoyed that Comfort that seem'd to me sufficient to over-ballance all my late Distresses. I saw, that God is the only Soul-satisfying Portion, and I really found Satisfaction in him: My Soul was much enlarged in sweet Intercession for my Fellow-Men every where, and for many Christian Friends, in particular, in distant Places.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="006311_0073_0000000000000000">Monday, <HI>August</HI> 23. Had a sweet Season in secret Prayer: The Lord drew near to my Soul, and filled me with Peace and divine Consolation. O, my Soul tasted the Sweetness of the upper World; and was sweetly drawn out in Prayer for the World, that it might come home to Christ! Had much Comfort in the Thoughts and Hopes of the Ingathering of the <HI>Heathen</HI>; was greatly assisted in Intercession for Christian Friends.</P>
<P>[He continued still in the same Frame of Mind the next Day, but in a lesser Degree.]</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>August</HI> 25. In Family-Prayer, God helped me to climb up near Him, so that I scarce ever got nearer.</P>
<P>[The four next Days, he appears to have been the Subject of Desertion, and of Comfort and Fervency in Religion, inter|changeably, together with a Sense of Vileness and Unprofita|bleness.]</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>August</HI> 30. Felt something comfortably in the Morning; conversed sweetly with some Friends; was in a se|rious composed Frame; pray'd at a certain House with some Degree of Sweetness. Afterwards, at another House, pray'd privately with a dear Christian Friend or two; and I think, I scarce ever launch'd so far into the eternal World, as then; I got so far out on the broad Ocean, that my Soul with Joy tri|umphed over all the Evils on the Shores of Mortality. I think, Time and all its gay Amusements and cruel Disappointments, never appeared so inconsiderable to me before: I was in a sweet Frame; I saw my self nothing, and my Soul reach'd after GOD with intense Desire. O! I saw what I owed to God, in such a Manner, as I scarce ever did: I knew, I had never lived a Moment to him, as I should do: Indeed it appeared to me, I had never done any Thing in Christianity: My Soul longed with a vehement Desire to <HI>live to GOD.</HI>&mdash;In the Evening, sung and pray'd with a Number of Christians: Felt <HI>the Powers of the World to come</HI>&punc; in my Soul, in Prayer. Afterwards pray'd again privately; with a dear Christian or two, and found the Presence of God; was something humbled in my secret Retirement; felt my Ingratitude, because I was not wholly swallowed up in GOD.</P>
<P>[He was in a sweet Frame great Part of the next Day.]</P>

My Thoughts were much in Eternity, where I love to dwell. Blessed be God for this so|lemn Season.&mdash; Rode home to Night with Mr. <HI>Bellamy</HI>; felt something sweetly on the Road; conversed with some Friends 'till it was very late, and then retired to Rest in a comfortable Frame.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>September</HI> 2. About two in the Afternoon, I preach'd from <HI>John</HI> vi.67. And God assisted me in some com|fortable Degree; but more especially in my first Prayer; my Soul seemed then to launch quite into the eternal World, and to be as it were separated from this lower World.&mdash; Afterwards preach'd again from <HI>Isaiah</HI> v.4. God gave me some Assistance; But I saw my self a poor Worm.</P>
<P>[On Friday, <HI>September</HI> 3. He complains of having but little Life in the Things of God, the former Part of the Day, but af|terwards speaks of Sweetness and Enlargement.]</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>September</HI> 4. Much out of Health, and exceedingly depress'd in my Soul, and was at an awful Distance from God.&mdash; Towards Night, spent some Time in profitable Thoughts on <HI>Rom.</HI> viii.2.&mdash; Near Night, had a very sweet Season in Prayer; God enabled me to wrestle ardently for the Advancement of the Redeemer's Kingdom; pleaded earnestly for my own dear Bro|ther <HI>John,</HI> that God would make him more of a Pilgrim and Stranger on the Earth, and fit him for singular Serviceableness in the World; and my Heart sweetly exulted in the Lord, in the Thoughts of any Distresses that might alight on him or me, in the Advancement of Christ's Kingdom. &mdash; 'Twas a sweet and com|fortable Hour unto my Soul, while I was indulged Freedom to plead, not only for my self, but for many other Souls.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>September</HI> 5. Preach'd all Day: was something strengthen'd &amp; assisted in the Afternoon; more especially in the Evening: had a Sense of my unspeakable Short-comings in all my Duties. I found, alas! that I had never lived to GOD in my Life.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="006311_0075_0000000000000000">Monday, <HI>Septemb.</HI> 6. Was informed, that they only waited for an Opportunity to apprehend me for Preaching at <HI>New-Ha|ven</HI> lately, that so they might imprison me: This made me more solemn and serious, and to quit all Hopes of the World's Friendship: It brought me to a further Sense of my Vileness, and just Desert of this, and much more, from the Hand of God, tho' not from the Hand of Man: Retired into a convenient Place in the Woods, and spread the Matter before God.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>Septemb.</HI> 7. Had some Relish of divine Things in the Morning. Afterwards felt more barren and melancholy. Rode to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> to a Friend's House at a Distance from the Town; that I remain undiscovered, and yet have Opportunity to do Business privately with Friends, which come to <HI>Com|mencement.</HI></P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Septemb.</HI> 8. Felt very sweetly, when I first rose in the Morning. In Family-Prayer, had some Enlargement, but not much Spirituality, 'till Eternity came up before me and look'd near; I found some Sweetness in the Thoughts of bidding a dying Farewell to this tiresom World: Tho' sometime ago I reckon'd upon seeing my dear Friends at <HI>Commencement,</HI> yet being now denied the Opportunity, for fear of Imprisonment I felt totally resign'd, and as contented to spend this Day alone ... the Woods, as I could have done, if I had been allowed to go to Town. Felt exceedingly wean'd from the World to Day.&mdash; In the Afternoon discoursed something on some divine Things with a dear Christian Friend, whereby we were both refreshed. Then I pray'd, with a sweet Sense of the Blessedness of Communion with GOD: I think, I scarce ever enjoyed more of GOD in any one Prayer. O it was a blessed Season indeed to my Soul! I knew not that ever I saw so much of my own Nothingness in my Life; never wondered so, that God allowed me to preach his Word; never was so astonished as now.&mdash;This has been a sweet and comforta|ble Day to my Soul: Blessed be God.&mdash; Pray'd again with my dear Friend, with something of the divine Presence.&mdash; I long to be wholly conformed to God, and transformed into his Image.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Septemb.</HI> 9. Spent much of the Day alone: En|joyed the Presence of God in some comfortable Degree: was visited by some dear Friends, and pray'd with them: Wrote sundry Letters to Friends; felt Religion in my Soul while writ|ing: Enjoyed some sweet Meditations on some Scriptures.&mdash; In the Evening, went very privately into Town, from the Place of my Residence at the Farms, and conversed with some dear Friends; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elt sweetly in singing Hymns with them; and made my Escape

to the Farms again, without being discovered by any Enemies, as I knew of. Thus the Lord preserves me continually.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>September</HI> 10. Longed with intense Desire after GOD: my whole Soul seem'd impatient to be Conformed to him, and to become <HI>Holy, as he is Holy.</HI>&mdash; In the Afternoon, pray'd with a dear Friend privately, and had the Presence of God with us; our Souls united together to reach after a blessed Immortality, to be unclothed of <HI>the Body of Sin and Death,</HI> and to enter the blessed World, where <HI>no unclean Thing enters.</HI> O, with what intense Desire did our Souls long for that blessed Day, that we might be freed from Sin, and forever live <HI>to</HI> and <HI>in</HI> our GOD!&mdash; In the Evening, took leave of that House; But first kneel'd down and prayed; <HI>The Lord was of a Truth in the midst of us</HI>; 'twas a sweet parting Season; felt in my self much Sweetness and Affec|tion in the Things of God. Blessed be God for every such divine Gale of his Spirit, to speed me on in my Way to the <HI>New-Jeru|salem!</HI>&mdash; Felt some Sweetness afterwards, and spent the Evening in Conversation with Friends, and pray'd with some Life, and retired to Rest very late.</P>
<P>[The five next Days, he appears to have been in an exceeding comfortable, sweet Frame of Mind, for the most Part, and to have been the Subject of the like heavenly Exercises as are often expressed in preceeding Passages of his Diary; such as hav|ing his Heart much engaged for God, wrestling with God in Prayer with Power and Ardency, enjoying at Times, sweet Calm|ness and Composure of Mind, giving himself up to God to be his forever, with great Complacence of Mind, being wholly resigned to the Will of God, that God might do with him what he pleased, longing well to improve Time, having the eternal World as it were brought nigh, longing after God and Holiness, earnestly desiring a compleat Conformity to him, and wondring how poor Souls do to exist without God.]</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>September</HI> 16. At Night, felt exceeding sweetly&punc; Enjoyed much of God in secret Prayer: Felt an uncommon Resig|nation, to <HI>be</HI> and <HI>do</HI> what God pleased. Some Days past, I felt <HI>great Perplexity</HI> on Account of my past Conduct: <HI>My Bitternes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and Want of Christian Kindness and Love, has been <HI>very distressing</HI> to my Soul: The Lord forgive me my <HI>unchristian Warmth,</HI> and want of a Spirit of Meekness.</P>

<P>Saturday, <HI>Septemb.</HI> 18. Felt some Compassion for Souls, and mourn'd I had no more. I feel much more Kindness, Meek|ness, Gentleness and Love towards all Mankind, than ever. I long to be at the Feet of my Enemies and Persecutors. Enjoyed some Sweetness, in feeling my Soul conform'd to <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> and given away to him forever, in Prayer to Day.</P>
<P>[The next Day, he speaks of much Dejection and Discou|ragement, from an Apprehension of his own Unfitness ever to do any Good in Preaching; But blesses God for all Dispensations of Providence and Grace; finding that by all God wean'd him more from the World, and made him more resign'd.</P>
<P>The next ten Days, he appears to have been for the most Part under great Degrees of Melancholy, exceedingly dejected and discouraged; speaks of his being ready to give up all for gone respecting the Cause of Christ, and exceedingly longing to die: Yet had some sweet Seasons and Intervals of Comfort, and special Assistance and Enlargement in the Duties of Religion, and in performing publick Services, and considerable Success in them.]</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>September</HI> 30. Still very low in Spirits, and did not know how to engage in any Work or Business, especially to <HI>cor|rect some Disorders among Christians</HI>; felt as tho' I had no Power to be faithful in that Regard.

<P>[Through this, and the two following Weeks, he passed through a Variety of Exercises: He was frequently dejected, and felt inward Distresses; and sometimes sunk into the Depths of Melancholy: At which Turns, he was not exercised about the State of his Soul, with Regard to the Favour of God and his In|terest in Christ, but about his own sinful Infirmities, and unfitness for God's Service. His Mind appears sometimes extremely de|press'd and sunk with a Sense of inexpressible Vileness. But in the mean Time, he speaks of many Seasons of Comfort and spiri|tual Refreshment, wherein his Heart was encouraged and strength|ned in God, and sweetly resigned to his Will, and of some

Seasons of very high Degrees of spiritual Consolation, and of his great Longings after Holiness and Conformity to God, of his great Fear of offending God, of his Heart's being sweetly melted in religious Duties, of his longing for the Advancement of Christ's Kingdom, and of his having at some Times much Assistance in Preaching, and of remarkable Effects on the Auditory.]</P>
<P>Lords-Day, <HI>Octob.</HI> 17. Had a considerable Sense of my Help|lesness and Inability; saw that I must be dependent on GOD for all I want; and especially when I went to the Place of publick Worship: I found I could not speak a Word for God without his special Help and Assistance: I went into the Assembly trem|bling, as I frequently do, under a Sense of my Insufficiency to do any Thing in the Cause of God, as I ought to do.&mdash; But it pleased God to afford me much Assistance, and there seem'd to be a considerable Effect on the Hearers.&mdash; In the Evening, I felt a Disposition to praise God for his Goodness to me, in special, that he had enabled me in some Measure to be faithful; and my Soul rejoyced to think, that I had thus performed the Work of one Day more, and was one Day nearer my eternal, and (I trust) my heavenly Home. O that I might be <HI>faithful to the Death, ful|filling as an Hireling my Day,</HI> 'till the Shades of the Evening of Life shall free my Soul from the Toils of the Day! This Even|ing, in secret Prayer, I felt exceeding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olemn, and such longing Desires after Deliverance from Sin, and after Conformity to God, as melted my Heart. Oh, I longed to be <HI>delivered from this Body of Death!</HI> I felt inward pleasing Pain, that I could not be con|formed to God entirely, fully and forever.&mdash; I scarce ever preach without being first visited with inward Conflicts and sore Trials.&mdash; Blessed be the Lord for these Trials and Distresses, as they are bless'd for my humbling.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 18. In the Morning, felt some Sweetness, but still press'd thro' some Trials of Soul. My Life is a con|stant Mixture of Consolations and Conflicts, and will be so 'till arrive at the World of Spirits.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>October</HI> 19. This Morning and last Night, felt a sweet Longing in my Soul after Holiness: My Soul seem'd so to reach and stretch towards the Mark of perfect Sanctity, that it was ready to break with Longings.</P>

<P>Friday, <HI>October</HI> 22.

It seem'd to me, I deserved rather to be driven out of the Place, than to have any Body treat me with any Kindness, or come to hear me preach. And verily my Spirits were so depress'd at this Time, as well as at many others, that it was impossible I should treat immortal Souls with Faithfulness: I could not deal closely &amp; faithfully with them, I felt so infinitely vile in myself. Oh, what <HI>Dust and Ashes</HI> I am, to think of preaching the Gospel to others!

<P>Saturday, <HI>Novemb.</HI> 27.

I was deprived of all Sense of God, even of the Being of a God; and that was my Misery! I had no awful Apprehen|sions of God as angry. This was Distress, the nearest a-kin to the Damned's Torments, that I ever endured; Their Tor|ment, I am sure, will consist much in a Privation of God, and consequently of all Good. This taught me the absolute Depen|dance of a Creature upon God the Creator, for every Crumb of Happiness it enjoys. Oh! I feel that if there is no God, tho' I might live for ever here, and enjoy not only this, but all other Worlds, I should be ten Thousand Times more miserable than a Toad!

<P>[The two next Days, his Comfort continues, and he seems to enjoy an almost continual Sweetness of Soul in the Duties and Exercises of Religion and Christian Conversation. On Monday was a Return of the Gloom he had been under the Friday before. He rode to <HI>Coventry</HI> this Day, and the latter Part of the Day had more Freedom. On Tuesday he rode to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and continued more comfortable.]</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Jan.</HI> 19. [At <HI>Canterbury.</HI>] In the Afternoon preach'd the Lecture at the Meeting-House: Felt some Ten|derness, and something of the Gospel-Temper: exhorted the People to love one another, and not to set up their own Frames as a Standard to try all their Brethren by. But was much press'd, most of the Day, with a Sense of my own Badness, inward Im|purity, and unspeakable Corruption. Spent the Evening in loving Christian Conversation.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Jan.</HI> 20. Rode to my Brother's House between <HI>Norwich</HI> and <HI>Lebanon</HI>; and preach'd in the Evening to a Num|ber of People: enjoy'd neither Freedom nor Spirituality; but saw my self exceeding unworthy.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Jan.</HI> 21. Had great inward Conflicts; enjoy'd but little Comfort. Went to see Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Lebanon,</HI> and spent several Hours with him; and was greatly delighted with his serious, deliberate and impartial Way of Discourse about Religion.</P>
<P>[The next Day, he was much dejected.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Jan.</HI> 23. Scarce ever felt my self so unfit to exist, as now: I saw, I was not worthy of a Place among the <HI>Indians,</HI> where I am going, if God permit: I thought, I should be ashamed to look them in the Face, and much more to have any Respect shewn me there. Indeed I felt my self banished from the Earth, as if all Places were too good for such a Wretch as I: I thought I should be ashamed to go among the very Sava|ges of <HI>Africa</HI>; I appeared to my self a Creature fit for Nothing, neither Heaven nor Earth.&mdash; None knows, but those that feel it, what the Soul endures that is sensibly shut out from the Pre|sence of God: Alas, 'tis more bitter than Death!</P>

<P>Wednesday, <HI>Jan.</HI> 26. Preach'd to a pretty large Assembly at Mr. <HI>Fish</HI>'s Meeting House: Insisted on Humility, &amp; Stedfastness in keeping God's Commands, and that thro' Humility we should prefer one another in Love, and not make our own Frames the Rule by which we judge others. I felt sweetly calm and, full of brotherly Love; and never more free from Party-Spirit. I hope, some Good will follow, that Christians will be freed from false Joy, and Party-Zeal, and censuring one another.</P>
<P>[On Thursday, after considerable Time spent in Prayer and Christian Conversation, he rode to <HI>New-London</HI>]</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Jan.</HI> 28. Here I found some fallen into some Extra|vagances, too much carried away with a false Zeal and Bitter|ness. Oh, the Want of a Gospel-Temper is greatly to be la|mented.

<P>Wednesday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 2. Preach'd my Farewell-Sermon, last Night, at the House of an aged Man, who had been unable to attend on the publick Worship for some Time; and this Morn|ing, spent the Time in Prayer, almost wherever I went; and having taken Leave of Friends, I set out on my Journey towards the <HI>Indians</HI>; tho' by the Way I was to spend some Time at <HI>East-Hampton</HI> on <HI>Long-Island,</HI> by the Leave of the Commissioners who employed me in the <HI>Indian</HI> Affair; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Reason why the Commissioners or Correspondents did not order Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> to go immediately to the <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> and enter on his Business as a Missionary to them, was that the <HI>Winter</HI> was not judged to be a convenient Season for him first to go out into the Wilderness, and enter on the Difficulties and Hardships he must there be exposed to.</NOTE> and being accompa|nied

<P>Saturday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 12.

<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Feb.</HI> 13. At Noon, under a great Degree of Discouragement; knew not how it was possible for me to preach in the Afternoon, was ready to give up all for gone; but God was pleased to assist me in some Measure. In the Evening, my Heart was sweetly drawn out after God, and devoted to him.</P>
<P>[The next Day, he had Comfort and Dejection intermingled.]</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 15. Early in the Day I felt some Comfort, afterwards I walked into a neighbouring Grove, and felt more as a Stranger on Earth, I think, than ever before; Dead to any of the Enjoyments of the World as if I had been dead in a na|tural Sense.&mdash;In the Evening, had divine Sweetness in secret Duty: God was then my Portion, and my Soul rose above those <HI>deep Waters,</HI> into which I have sunk so low of late:&mdash;My Soul then cried for <HI>Zion,</HI> and had Sweetness in so doing.</P>

In the Evening, spent some Time with a dear Christian Friend; felt sweetly serious, as on the Brink of Eternity; my Soul enjoyed Sweetness in lively Apprehensions of standing before the glorious God: prayed with my dear Friend with Sweetness, and discoursed with utmost Solemnity. And truly it was a little Emblem of Heaven it self.&mdash;I find my Soul is more refined and weaned from a Dependance on my Frames and spiritual Feelings.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 18. Felt something sweetly most of the Day, and found access to the Throne of Grace. Blessed be the Lord for any Intervals of heavenly Delight and Composure, while I am engaged in the Field of Battle. O that I might be serious, solemn and always vigilant, while in an evil World. Had some Opportunity alone to Day, and found some Freedom in Study. O, I long to <HI>live to</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 19. Was exceeding infirm to Day, greatly troubled with Pain in my Head and Dizziness, scarce able to sit up.

I exceedingly long to die, and yet through divine Goodness have felt very willing to live, for two or three Days past.</P>

<P>Monday, <HI>March</HI> 7. This Morning when I arose, I found my Heart go forth after God in longing Desires of Conformity to him, and in secret Prayer found my self sweetly quicken'd and drawn out in Praises to God for all he had done to and for me, and for all my inward Trials and Distresses of late; my Heart ascribed Glory, Glory, Glory to the blessed God!

<P>FRiday, <HI>April</HI> 1. 1743. I rode to <HI>Kaunaumeek,</HI> near twenty Miles from <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> where the <HI>Indians</HI> live, with whom I am concerned, and there lodg'd on a little Heap of Straw: was greatly exercised with inward Trials and Distresses all Day; and in the Evening, my Heart was sunk, and I seemed to have no God to go to.

<P>[The next five Days, he was for the most Part in a dejected depress'd State of Mind, and sometimes extreamly so.

<P>Friday, <HI>April</HI> 7. Appeared to my self exceeding ignorant, weak, helpless, and unworthy, and altogether unequal to my Work. It seem'd to me, I should never do any Service, or have any Success among the <HI>Indians.</HI> My Soul was weary of my Life: I longed for Death, beyond Measure. When I thought of any godly Soul departed, my Soul was ready to envy him his Privilege, thinking, <HI>Oh, when will my Turn come!

<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>April</HI> 10. Rose early in the Morning, and walked out, and spent considerable Time in the Woods, in Prayer and Meditation. Preach'd to the <HI>Indians,</HI> both Forenoon and Afternoon. They behaved soberly in general: two or three in particular appeared under some religious Concern; with whom I discoursed privately; and one told me, <HI>her Heart had cried, ever since she heard me preach first.</HI></P>
<P>[The next Day, he complains of much Desertion.]</P>

<P>Wednesday, <HI>April</HI> 13. My Heart was overwhelmed within me: I verily thought I was the meanest, vilest, most helpless,

guilty, ignorant, benightned Creature living. And yet I knew what God had done for my Soul, at the same Time: Tho' some|times I was assaulted with damping Doubts and Fears, whether it was possible for such a Wretch as I to be in a State of Grace.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>April</HI> 14. Remain'd much in the same State as Yesterday.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>April</HI> 15. In the Forenoon, very disconsolate. In the Afternoon, preach'd to my People, and was a little encou|raged in some Hopes God might bestow Mercy on their Souls.&mdash; Felt something resigned to God under all Dispensations of his Providence.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>April</HI> 16. Still in the Depths of Distress.&mdash; In the Afternoon, preach'd to my People; but was more discouraged with them than before; fear'd that nothing would ever be done for them to any happy Effect. I retired and poured out my Soul to God for Mercy; but without any sensible Relief. Soon after, came an <HI>Irish-man</HI> and a <HI>Dutch-m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> with a Design, as they said, to hear me preach the next Day; but none can tell how I felt, to hear their profane Talk. Oh, I longed that some dear Christian knew my Distress. I got into a Kind of Hovel, and there groan'd out my Complaint to God; and withal felt more sensible Gratitude and Thankfulness to God, that he had made me to differ from these Men, as I knew thro' Grace he had.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>April</HI> 17. In the Morning was again distressed as soon as I waked, hearing much Talk about the World and the Things of it: Tho' I perceived the Men were in some Measure afraid of me; and I discoursed something about sancti|fying the Sabbath, if possible, to solemnize their Minds: But when they were at a little Distance, they again talked freely about secular Affairs. Oh, I thought what a <HI>Hell</HI> it would be, to live with such Men to Eternity! The Lord gave me some Assist|ance in Preaching, all Day, and some Resignation, and a small Degree of Comfort in Prayer at Night.</P>
<P>[He continued in this disconsolate Frame the next Day.]</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>April</HI> 19. In the Morning, enjoyed some sweet Repose and Rest in God; felt some Strength and Confidence in God; and my Soul was in some Measure refresh'd and com|forted. Spent most of the Day in Writing, and had some Ex|ercise of Grace sensible and comfortable; my Soul seem'd lifted above the <HI>deep Waters,</HI> wherein it has been so long almost drowned;
<PB N="69" REF="006311_0100_0000000000000000">
felt some spiritual Longings and Breathings of Soul after God; found my self engaged for the Advancement of Christ's King|dom in my own Soul, more than in others, more than in the Heathen World.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>April</HI> 20. Set apart this Day for Fasting and Prayer, to bow my Soul before God for the Bestowment of di|vine Grace; especially that all my spiritual Afflictions and in|ward Distresses might be sanctified to my Soul. And endea|voured also to remember the Goodness of God to me in the Year past, this Day being my <HI>Birth-Day.</HI> Having obtained Help of God, I have hitherto lived, and am now arrived at the Age of 25 Years. My Soul was pained, to think of my Barrenness and Deadness; that I have lived so little to the Glory of the eternal God. I spent the Day in the Woods alone, and there poured out my Complaint to God. O that God would enable me to live to his Glory for the future.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>April</HI> 21. Spent the Forenoon in Reading and Prayer, and found my self something engaged; but still much depress'd in Spirit under a Sense of my Vileness and Unfitness for any publick Service. In the Afternoon, I visited my Peo|ple, and prayed and conversed with some about their Souls Con|cerns: and afterwards found some Ardour of Soul in secret Prayer. O that I might grow up into the Likeness of God.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>April</HI> 22. Spent the Day in Study, Reading and Prayer; and felt a little relieved of my Burden, that has been so heavy of late. But still in some Measure oppress'd: had a Sense of Barrenness. Oh, <HI>my Leanness</HI> testifies against me! My very Soul abhor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it self for it's Unlikeness to God, it's Inactivity and Sluggishness. When I have done all, alas, what an <HI>un|profitable Servant</HI> am I! My Soul groans, to see the Hours of the Day roll away, because I don't fill them, in Spirituality and Heavenly-Mindedness. And yet I long they should speed their Pace, to hasten me to my eternal Home, where I may fill up all my Moments, thro' Eternity, for God and his Glory.</P>
<P>[On Saturday and Lord's-Day, his Melancholy again pre|vailed: He cried out of his Ignorance, Stupidity, and Sense|lesness; while yet he seems to have spent the Time with ut|most Diligence, in Study, in Prayer, and in Instructing and Counselling the <HI>Indians.</HI> On Monday, he sunk into the deepest Melancholy; so that he supposed he never spent a Day in such Distress in his Life; not in Fears of Hell, (which, he says, he had no pressing Fear of) but a distressing Sense of his own Vile|ness

&amp;c. On Tuesday, he expresses some Relief. Wednesday he kept as a Day of Fasting and Prayer, but in great Distress. The three Days next following, his Melancholy continued, but in a lesser Degree, and with Intervals of Comfort. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the last of these Days he wrote the <HI>first Letter</HI> added at the End of this History.</NOTE>]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>May</HI> 1. Was at <HI>Stockbridge</HI> to Day. In the Forenoon had some Relief and Assistance; tho' not so much as usual. In the Afternoon, felt poorly in Body and Soul; while I was preaching, seemed to be rehearsing idle Tales, without the least Life, Fervour, Sense, or Comfort: and especially afterwards, at the Sacrament, my Soul was filled with Confusion, and the utmost Anguish that ever I endured, under the Feeling of my inexpressible Vileness and Meanness: It was a most bitter and distressing Season to me, by Reason of the View I had of my own Heart, and the secret Abominations that lurk there: I tho't the Eyes of all in the House were upon me, and I dared not look any One in the Face; for it verily seem'd as if they saw the Vile|ness of my Heart, and all the Sins I had ever been guilty of. And if I had been banished from the Presence of all Mankind&punc; never to be seen any more, or so much as thought of, still I should have been distressed with Shame; and I should have been ashamed to see the most barbarous People on Earth, because I was viler, and seemingly more brutishly ignorant than they.&mdash; <HI>I am made to possess the Sins of my Youth.</HI></P>
<P>[The remaining Days of this Week were spent, for the most Part, in inward Distress and Gloominess. The next Sabbath, he had Encouragement, Assistance and Comfort; but on Monday <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unk again.]</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>May</HI> 10. Was in the same State, as to my Mind, that I have been in for some Time, extremely press'd with a Sense of Guilt, Pollution, Blindness: <HI>The Iniquity of my Heels have compassed me about</HI>; the <HI>Sins of my Youth</HI> have been <HI>set in order before me</HI>; they have <HI>gone over my Head, as an heavy Burden, too heavy for me to bear,</HI> Almost all the Actions of my Life past seem to be cover'd over with Sin and Guilt; and those of them that I performed in the most conscientious Manner, now fill me with Shame &amp; Confusion, that I cannot hold up my Face. Oh! the <HI>Pride, Selfishness, Hypocrisy, Ignorance, Bitterness, Party-Zeal,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Want</HI>

of Love, Candour, Meekness and Gentleness, that have attended my Attempts to promote Religion and Vertue; and this when I have Reason to hope I had real Assistance from above, and some sweet Intercourse with Heaven! But alas, what <HI>corrupt Mixtures</HI> attended my best Duties!</P>
<P>[The next seven Days, his Gloom and Distress continued, for the most Part: but he had some Turns of Relief and spiri|tual Comfort. He gives an Account of his spending Part of this Time in hard Labour, to build himself a little <HI>Cottage</HI> to live in a|mongst the <HI>Indians,</HI> in which he might be by himself; having (it seems) hitherto lived with a poor Scotch-Man, as he observes in the Letter just now refer'd to in the Margin; and afterwards, be|fore his own House was habitable, lived in a Wigwam among the <HI>Indians.</HI>]</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>May</HI> 18. My Circumstances are such that I have no Comfort, of any Kind, but what I have in God. I live in the most lonesom Wilderness; have but one single Person to Converse with, that can speak <HI>English</HI>: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Person was Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Interpreter; who was an ingenious young <HI>Indian</HI> belonging to <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> whose Name was <HI>John Wauwaumpequunnaunt,</HI> who had been in|structed in the Christian Religion by Mr. <HI>Sergeant</HI>; and had lived with the Rev. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Long-Meadow,</HI> and had been further instructed by him, at the Charge of Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI> of <HI>London</HI>; and understood both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> very well, and wrote a good Hand.</NOTE> Most of the Talk I hear, is either <HI>Highland-Scotch</HI> or <HI>Indian.</HI> I have no Fellow-Christian to whom I might unbosom my self, and lay open my spiritual Sorrows, and with whom I might take sweet Counsel in Conversation about heavenly Things, and join in social Prayer. I live poorly with Regard to the Comforts of Life: most of my Diet consists of boil'd Corn, Hasty-Pudding, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I lodge on a Bundle of Straw, and my Labour is hard and extreamly difficult; and I have little Appearance of Success, to comfort me. The <HI>Indians</HI> Affairs are very difficult; having no Land to live on, but what the <HI>Dutch</HI> People lay Claim to, and threaten to drive them off from; they have no Regard to the Souls of the poor <HI>Indians</HI>; and, by what I can learn, they hate me, because I come to preach to 'em.&mdash; But that which makes all my Difficulties grievous to be born, is, that <HI>God hides his Face from me.</HI></P>

<P>Friday, <HI>May</HI> 20. Was much perplexed, some Part of the Day; but towards Night, had some comfortable Meditations on <HI>Isai.</HI> xl.1. And enjoyed some Sweetness in Prayer.

<P><PB N="73" REF="006311_0104_0000000000000000">[From this Time forward he was the Subject of various Frames and Exercises of Mind: But it seems, in the general, to have been with him much after the same Manner as it had been hi|therto from his first coming to <HI>Kaunaumeek,</HI> 'till he got into his own House (a little <HI>Hut,</HI> that he made chiefly with his own Hands, with long and hard Labour) which was near seven Weeks from this Time. Great Part of this Space of Time, he was de|jected and depressed with Melancholy, and sometimes very ex|treamly: his Melancholy operating in like Manner as has been related of Times past. How it was with him in those dark Sea|sons, he himself further describes in his Diary for <HI>July</HI> 2. in the following Manner. <HI>My Soul is, and has for a long Time been in a piteous Condition, wading thro' a Series of Sorrows, of various Kinds. I have been so crush'd down sometimes with a Sense of my Meanness and infinite Unworthiness, that I have been ashamed that any even the meanest of my Fellow-Creatures should so much as spend a Thought about me, &amp; have wish'd sometimes while I have travelled among the thick Brokes, as one of them, to drop into everlasting Oblivion. In this Case, sometimes, I have almost resolved never again to see any of my Acquaintance; and really thought, I could not do it and bold up my Face; and have longed for the remotest Region, for a Retreat from all my Friends, that I might not be seen or heard of any more.&mdash;Sometimes the Consideration of my Ignorance has been a Means of my great Distress and Anxiety. And especially my Soul has been in Anguish with Fear, Shame, and Guilt, that ever I had preach'd, or had any Thought that Way.&mdash; Sometimes my Soul has been in Distress on feeling some particular Corruptions rise and swell like a mighty Torrent, with present Violence; having at the same Time, ten Thou|sand former Sins and Follie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> presented to View, in all their Blackness and Aggravations.&mdash; And these attended with such external Circum|stances as mine at present are; destitute of most of the Conveniences of Life, and I may say, of all the Pleasures of it; without a Friend to communicate any of my Sorrows to, and sometimes without any Place of Retirement, where I may unburden my Soul before God, which has greatly contributed to my Distress.&mdash; Of late, more especially, my great Difficulty has been a Sort of Carelesness, a Kind of regardless Temper of Mind, whence I have been disposed to Indolence and Tri|fling: And this Temper of Mind has constantly been attended with Guilt and Shame; so that sometimes I have been in a Kind of Horror, to find my self so unlike the blessed God; and have thought I grew worse under all my Trials; and nothing has cut and wounded my Soul more than This. Oh, if I am one of God's chosen, as I trust thro' infinite Grace I am, I find of a Truth, that</HI> the righteous are scarcely saved!</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="006311_0105_0000000000000000">'Tis apparen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that one main Occasion of that distressing Gloo|miness of Mind which he was so much exercised with at <HI>Kaunau|meek,</HI> was Reflection on his past Errors and misguided Zeal at <HI>College,</HI> in the Beginning of the late religious Commotions in the Land. And therefore he repeated his Endeavours this Year for Reconciliation with the Governours of the College, whom he had in that Time offended. Altho' he had been at <HI>New-Haven</HI> in <HI>June,</HI> this Year, and had attempted a Reconciliation, as has been mentioned already, yet in the Beginning of <HI>July,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e made another Journey thither, and renewed his Attempt, but still in vain.</P>
<P>Altho' he was much dejected, great Part of that Space of Time that I am now speaking of, yet there were many Inter|missions of his Melancholy, and some Seasons of Comfort, sweet Tranquillity and Resignation of Mind, and frequent special Assistance in publick Services, that he speaks of in his Diary. The Manner of his Relief from his Sorrow, once in particular, is worthy to be mention'd in his own Words, in his Diary for <HI>July</HI> 25, which are as follows: <HI>Had little or no Resolution for a Life of Holiness; was ready almost to renounce my Hopes of living to God. And Oh how dark it look'd, to think of being unholy for ever! This I could not endure. The Cry of my Soul was that, Psal.</HI> lxv.3. Iniquities prevail against me. <HI>But was in some Mea|sure relieved by a comfortable Meditation on God's Eternity, That he never had a Beginning,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Whence I was le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to admire his Great|ness and Power</HI> &amp;c. <HI>in such a Manner, that I stood still &amp; prais'd the Lord for his own Glories and Perfections; tho' I was (and if I should forever be) an unholy Creature, my Soul was comforted to apprehend an eternal, infinite, powerful, Holy</HI> GOD.]</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>July</HI> 30. Just at Night, moved into <HI>my own House,</HI> and lodged there that Night; found it much better spending the Time alone in my own House, than in the <HI>Wigwam</HI> where I was before.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>July</HI> 31. Felt more comfortably than some Days past.&mdash; Blessed be the Lord, that has now given me a Place of Retirement.&mdash; O that I might <HI>find God</HI> in it, and that he would dwell with me for ever.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 1. Was still busy in further Labours on my House.&mdash;Felt a little of the Sweetness of Religion, and thought it was worth the while to <HI>follow after God</HI> thro' a Thousand Snares, Desarts, and Death it self. O that I might always <HI>follow after Holiness,</HI> that I may be fully conformed to God. Had
<PB N="75" REF="006311_0106_0000000000000000">
some Degree of Sweetness, in secret Prayer, tho' I had much Sorrow.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 2. Was still labouring to make my self more comfortable with Regard to my House and Lodging. Labour'd under spiritual Anxiety; It seem'd to me, I deserved to be kick'd out of the World; yet found some Comfort in <HI>committing my Cause to God. 'Tis good for me to be afflicted,</HI> that I may die wholly to this World and all that is in it.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 3. Spent most of the Day in Writing. Enjoyed some Sense of Religion. Thro' divine Goodness I am now uninterruptedly alone; and find my Retirement comforta|ble. I have enjoyed more Sense of divine Things within a few Days last past, than for some Time before. I longed after Holi|ness, Humility &amp; Meekness: O that God would enable me to <HI>pass the Time of my sojourning here in his Fear,</HI> and always <HI>live to him.</HI></P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 4. Was enabled to pray much, thro' the whole Day; and thro' divine Goodness found some Intenseness of Soul in the Duty, as I used to do, and some Ability to perse|vere in my Supplications: Had some Apprehensions of divine Things, that were engaging, and that gave me some Courage and Resolution. 'Tis good, I find, to <HI>persevere in Attempts</HI> to pray, if I can't <HI>pray with Perseverance,</HI> i. e. continue long in my Ad|dresses to the divine Being. I have generally found, that the more I do in secret Prayer, the more I have delighted to do, and have enjoyed more of a Spirit of Prayer: and frequently have found the contrary, when with Journeying or otherwise, I have been much deprived of Retirement. A seasonable steady Performance of secret Duties in their proper Hours, &amp; a careful Improvement of all Time, filling up every Hour with some profitable Labour, either of Heart, Head, or Hands, are excellent Means of spiritual Peace and Boldness before God. <HI>Christ</HI> indeed is <HI>our Peace,</HI> and <HI>by him we have Boldness of Access to God</HI>; but a <HI>good Conscience, void of Offence,</HI> is an excellent Preparation for an Approach into the divine Presence. There is Difference between <HI>Self-Confi|dence</HI> and a <HI>Self-righteous pleasing ourselves</HI> (with our own Duties, Attainments, and spiritual Enjoyments) which godly Souls some|times are guilty of, and that <HI>holy Confidence</HI> arising from the Testimony of a good Conscience, which good <HI>Hezekiah</HI> had when he says, <HI>Remember, O Lord, I beseech Thee, how I have walked before thee in Truth and with a perfect Heart. Then</HI> (says the holy Psalmist) <HI>shall I not be ashamed, when I have Respect to all thy Commandments.</HI> Filling up our Time <HI>with</HI> and <HI>for</HI> GOD is the Way to rise up and lie down in Peace.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="006311_0107_0000000000000000">[The next eight Days, he continued for the most Part in a very comfortable Frame, having his Mind fixed and sweetly en|gaged in Religion; and more than once blesses God, that he had given him a little <HI>Cottage,</HI> where he might live alone, and enjoy a happy Retirement, free from Noise and Disturbance, and could at any Hour of the Day lay aside all Studies, and spend Time in lifting up his Soul to God for spiritual Blessings.]</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 13. Was enabled in secret Prayer to raise my Soul to God, with Desire and Delight. It was indeed a blessed Season to my Soul: I found the Comfort of being a Christian: <HI>I counted the Sufferings of the present Life not worthy to be compared with the Glory</HI> of divine Enjoyments, even in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> World. All my past Sorrows seemed kindly to disappear, and I <HI>remembred no more the Sorrow, for Joy</HI> &mdash; O, how kindly&punc; and with what a filial Tenderness, the Soul hangs on, and con|fides in <HI>the Rock of Ages,</HI> at such a Season, that he will <HI>never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it nor forsake it,</HI> that he will cause <HI>all Things to work together for its Good, &amp;c!</HI> I longed, that others should know how good a God the Lord is. My Soul was full of Tenderness and Love, even to the most inveterate of my Enemies: I long'd they should share in the same Mercy. I loved and longed that God should do just as he pleased, with me and every Thing else. I felt exceeding serious, calm and peaceful, and encouraged to press after Holiness as long as I live, whatever Difficulties and Trials may be in my Way. May the Lord always help me so to do: <HI>Amen,</HI> and <HI>Amen!</HI></P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Aug.</HI> 14. I had much more Freedom in publick, than in private. God enabled me to speak with some feeling Sense of divine Things; but perceived no considerable Effect.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 15. Spent most of the Day in Labour to pro|cure something to keep my Horse on in the Winter.&mdash;Enjoyed not much Sweetness in the Morning: Was very weak in Body, through the Day, and tho't this frail Body would soon drop into the Dust: Had some very realizing Apprehensions of a speedy Entrance into another World. And in this weak State of Body, was not a little distressed for want of suitable Food. Had no Bread, nor could I get any. I am forced to go or send ten or fifteen Miles for all the Bread I eat; and sometimes 'tis mouldy and soure, before I eat it, if I get any considerable Quantity: And then again I have none for some Days together, for want of an Opportunity to send for it, and can't find my Horse in the Woods to go my self; and this was my Case now: But thro' divine Goodness I had some <HI>Indian Meal,</HI> of which I
<PB N="77" REF="006311_0108_0000000000000000">
made little Cakes, and fried them. Yet felt contented with my Circumstances, and sweetly resigned to God. In Prayer I en|joyed great Freedom; and bless'd God as much for my present Circumstances, as if I had been a King; and thought, I found a Disposition to be contented in any Circumstances: Blessed be God!</P>

In his Diary for Saturday, he says, He was something Melancholy and sorrowful in Mind; and adds, <HI>I never feel comfortably, but when I find my Soul going forth after God: If I can't be holy, I must necessarily be miserable for ever.</HI>]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Aug.</HI> 21. Was much straiten'd in the Forenoon-Exercise: my Thoughts seem'd to be all scatter'd to the Ends of the Earth. At Noon, I fell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">down before the Lord, and groan'd under my Vileness, Barrenness, Deadness, and felt as if I was guilty of Soul-Murther, in speaking to immortal Souls in such a Manner as I had then done.&mdash; In the Afternoon, God was pleas'd to give me some Assistance, and I was enabled to set before my Hearers the Nature and Necessity of true Repen|tance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Afterwards had some small Degree of Thankfulness. Was very ill and full of Pain in the Evening; and my Soul mourned that <HI>I</HI> had spent so much Time to so little Profit.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 22. Spent most of the Day in Study; and found my bodily Strength in a Measure restored. Had some intense and passionate Breathings of Soul after Holiness, and very clear Manifestations of my utter Inability to procure, or work it in my self; 'tis wholly owing to the Power of God. O, with what Tenderness the Love and Desire of Holiness fills the Soul! I wanted to wing out of my self, to GOD; or rather to get a Conformi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to Him: But alas, I can't add to my Stature in Grace one Cubit. However, my Soul can never leave striving for it; or at least groaning, that it can't strive for it, and obtain more Purity of Heart. &mdash; At Night, I spent some Time in instructing my poor People: Oh, that God would pity their Souls.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 23. Studied in the Forenoon, and enjoy'd some Freedom. In the Afternoon, laboured Abroad: Endea|voured
<PB N="78" REF="006311_0109_0000000000000000">
to pray much; but found not much Sweetness or In|tenseness of Mind. Towards Night, was very weary, &amp; tir'd of this World of Sorrow: The Thoughts of Death &amp; Immor|tality appeared very desirable, and even refresh'd my Soul. Those Lines turned in my Mind with Pleasure,</P>
<L>Come, Death, shake Hands; I'll kiss thy Bands:</L>
<L>'Tis Happiness for me to die.</L>
<L>What! Dost thou think, that I will shrink?</L>
<L>I'll go to Immortality.</L>
<P>In Evening-Prayer, God was pleased to draw near my Soul, tho' very sinful and unworthy: Was enabled to wrestle with God, and to persevere in my Requests for Grace: I poured out my Soul for all the World, Friends and Enemies. My Soul was concerned, not so much for Souls as such, but rather for Christ's Kingdom, that it might appear in the World, that God might be known to be God, in the whole Earth. And Oh, my Soul abhor'd the very Thought of a <HI>Party</HI> in Religion! Let the Truth of God appear, wherever it is; and God have the Glory for ever, <HI>Amen.</HI> This was indeed a comfortable Season: I tho't I had some small Taste of, and real Relish for the Enjoy|ments and Employments of the upper World. O that my Soul was more attemper'd to it.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 24. Spent some Time, in the Morning, in Study and Prayer. Afterwards, was engaged in some necessary Business Abroad. Towards Night, found a little Time for some particular Studies. I thought, if God should say, <HI>Cease making any Provision for this Life, for you shall in a few Days go out of Time into Eternity,</HI> my Soul would leap for Joy. O that I may both <HI>desire to be dissolved to be with Christ,</HI> and likewise <HI>wait pati|ently all the Days of my appointed Time 'till my Change come.</HI>&mdash;But alas, I am very unfit for the Business &amp; Blessedness of Heaven.&mdash; O for more Holiness.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 25. Part of the Day, engaged in Studies; and part, in Labour Abroad. I find, 'tis impossible to enjoy Peace and Tranquillity of Mind without a careful Improvement of Time. This is really an Imitation of God and Christ Jesus: <HI>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work,</HI> says our Lord. But still, if we would be like God, we must see that we fill up our Time for him.&mdash; I daily long to dwell in perfect Light &amp; Love. In the mean Time my Soul mourns, that I make so little Pro|gress in Grace and Preparation for the World of Blessedness: I see and know that I am a very barren Tree in God's Vineyard,
<PB N="79" REF="006311_0110_0000000000000000">
and that he might justly say, <HI>Cut it down</HI> &amp;c. O that God would make me more lively and vigorous in Grace, for his own Glory! <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>[The two next Days, he was much engaged in some necessary Labours, in which he extreamly spent himself. He seems, these Days to have had a great Sense of the Vanity of the World; and continued Longings after Holiness, and more Fervency of Spirit in the Service of God.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Aug.</HI> 28. Was much perplex'd with some irre|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gious <HI>Dutch-men.</HI> All their Discourse turned upon the Things of the World: which was no small Exercise to my Mind. Oh, what a <HI>Hell</HI> it would be to spend an Eternity with such Men!

<P>[The next Day, he set out on a Journey to <HI>New-York.</HI> Was something dejected, the two first Days of his Journey; but yet seems to have enjoyed some Degrees of the sensible Presence of God.]</P>

<P>Saturday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 10. Rode six Miles to <HI>Stanwich,</HI> and preach'd to a considerable Assembly of People. Had some Assistance and Freedom, especially towards the Close.

<P>Thursday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 15. Had some Satisfaction in hearing the Ministers discourse <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'Tis always a Comfort to me, to hear religious and spiritual Discourse. O that Ministers and People were more spiritual and devoted to God.&mdash; Towards Night, with the Advice of Christian Friends, I offered the fol|lowing Reflections in Writing, to the <HI>Rector and Trustees of the College</HI> (which are for Substance the same that I had freely of|fered to the <HI>Rector</HI> before, and intreated him to accept) and this I did that if possible I might cut off all Occasion of Stumbling and Offence, from those that seek Occasion. What I offered, is as follows.</P>
<P><Q>Whereas I have said before several Persons, concerning Mr. <HI>Whittelsey,</HI> one of the Tutors of <HI>Yale College,</HI> that <HI>I did not believe he had any more Grace, than the Chair I then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">an'd upon</HI>; I humbly confess, that herein I have sin'd against God, and acted contrary to the Rules of his Word, and have injured Mr. <HI>Whittelsey.</HI> I had no Right to make thus free with his Character; and had no just Reason to say as I did concerning him. My Fault herein was the more Aggravated, in that I said this concerning One that was so much my Superiour, and one that I was obliged to treat with special Respect and Ho|nour, by Reason of the Relation I stood in to him in the College. Such a Manner of Behaviour, I confess, did not become a Christian; it was taking too much upon me, and
<PB N="82" REF="006311_0113_0000000000000000">
did not savour of that humble Respect, that I ought to have express'd towards Mr. <HI>Whittesey.</HI> I have long since been convinced of the <HI>Falseness</HI> of those <HI>Apprehensions,</HI> by which I then justified such a Conduct. I have often reflected on this Act with Grief; I hope, on Account of the <HI>Sin</HI> of it: And am willing to lie low, and be abased before God and Man for it. And humbly ask the Forgiveness of the Governours of the College, and of the whole Society; but of Mr. <HI>Whit|telsey</HI> in particular. And whereas I have been accused by one Person of saying concerning the Rev. <HI>Rector</HI> of <HI>Yale-College,</HI> that <HI>I wondered he did not expect to drop down dead for fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g the Scholars that followed Mr.</HI> Tennent <HI>to</HI> Milford; I seriously profess, that I don't remember my saying any Thing to this Purpose. But if I did, which I am not certain I did not, I utterly <HI>condemn</HI> it, and <HI>detest</HI> all such Kind of Behaviour; and especially in an Undergraduate towards the Rector. And I now appear, to judge and condemn my self for <HI>going once to the separate Meeting in</HI> New-Haven, a little before I was ex|pell'd, <HI>tho' the Rector had refused to give me Leave.</HI> For this I humbly ask the Rector's Forgiveness. And whether the Governours of the College shall ever see Cause to remove the Academical Censure I lie under, or no, or to admit me to the Priviledges I desire; yet I am willing to appear, if they think fit, openly to own, and to humble my self for those Things I have herein confess'd.</Q></P>
<P>God has made me willing to do any Thing, that I can do, consistent with Truth, for the Sake of Peace, and that I might not be a Stumbling-block and Offence to others. For this Rea|son I can cheerfully forego, and give up what I verily believe, after the most mature and impartial Search, is my Right, in some Instances. God has given me that Disposition, that if this were the Case, that a Man has done me an <HI>hundred Injuries,</HI> and I (tho' ever so much provoked to it) have done Him <HI>one,</HI> I feel disposed, and heartily willing humbly to confess my Fault to him, and on my Knees to ask Forgiveness of him; tho' at the same Time he should justify himself in all the Injuries he has done me, and should only make Use of my humble Confession to blacken my Character the more, and represent me as the only Person guilty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yea, tho' he should as it were insult me, and say <HI>He knew all this before, and that I was making work for Repen|tance,</HI> &amp;c.

There truly appear'd in him a great De|gree of Calmness and Humility; without the least Ap|pearance of Rising of Spirit for any ill Treatment he sup|posed he had suffered, or the least Backwardness to abase himself before Them who he thought had wrong'd him. What he did was without any Objection or Appearance of Reluctance, even in private to his Friends, that he freely open'd himself to. Earnest Application was made on his Behalf to the Authority of the College, that he might have his Degree then given him; and particularly by the Rev.

I continued very full of Pain all Night; and in the Morning had a very hard Fever, and Pains almost all over my whole Body.

<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Octob.</HI> 16. In the Evening, God was pleased to give me a feeling Sense of my own Unworthiness; but thro' di|vine Goodness such as tended to draw, rather than drive me from God: It fill'd me with Solemnity. I retired alone (having at this Time a Friend with me) and poured out my Soul to God, with much Freedom; and yet in Anguish, to find my self so unspeakably sinful and unworthy before a holy God. Was now much resigned under God's Dispensations towards me, tho' my Trials had been very great. But thought whether I could be resign'd, if God should let the <HI>French Indians</HI> come upon me, and deprive me of my Life, or carry me away Captive (tho' I knew of no special Reason then to propose this Trial to myself, more than any other) and my Soul seem'd so far to rest and ac|quiesce in God, that the Sting and Terror of these Things seem'd in a great Measure gone. Presently after I came to the <HI>Indians,</HI> whom I was teaching to sing Psalm-Tunes that Evening, I re|ceived the following Letter from <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> by a Messenger sent on the Sabbath on Purpose, which made it appear of greater Importance.</P>

<P>Wednesday, <HI>Novemb.</HI> 30. Pursued my Study of <HI>Indian</HI>: But was very weak and disordered in Body, and was troubled in Mind at the Barrenness of the Day, that I had done so little for God. I had some Enlargement in Prayer at Night. Oh, a Barn, or Stable, Hedge, or any other Place, is truly desirable, if God is there! Sometimes, of late, my Hopes of <HI>Zion</HI>'s Pros|perity are more raised, than they were in the Summer past. My Soul seems to confide in God, that he will yet <HI>shew forth his Salvation</HI> to his People, and make <HI>Zion</HI> the <HI>Joy of the whole Earth.</HI> O <HI>how excellent is the Loving-kindness of the Lord!</HI> My Soul some|times inwardly exults at the lively Thoughts of what God has already done for his Church, and what <HI>mine Eyes have seen of the Salvation of God.</HI> 'Tis sweet, to hear nothing but spiritual Discourse from God's Children; and Sinners <HI>enquiring the Way to</HI> Zion, saying, <HI>What shall we do,</HI> &amp;c. O that I may see more of this blessed Work.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 1. Both Morning and Evening, I en|joyed some Intenseness of Soul in Prayer, and longed for the Enlargement of Christ's Kingdom in the World. My Soul seems, of late, to <HI>wait on</HI> GOD for his Blessing on <HI>Zion.</HI> O that Re|ligion might powerfully revive.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 2. Enjoy'd not so much Health of Body, or Fervour of Mind, as Yesterday. If the Chariot-Wheels move with Ease and Speed at any Time, for a short Space; yet by and by they drive heavily again. <HI>O that I had the Wings of a Dove, that I might fly away</HI> from Sin &amp; Corruption, and be <HI>at Rest in</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 3. Rode Home, to my House and People. Suffered much with the extreme Cold.&mdash; I trust, I shall, 'ere long, arrive safe to my Journey's End, where my Toils shall cease.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 4. Had but little Sense of divine and heavenly Things. My Soul mourns over my Barrenness. Oh how sad is spiritual Deadness!</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 5. Rode to <HI>Stockbridge.</HI> Was almost out done with the extream Cold. Had some refreshing Meditations by the Way; but was barren, wandring, and Lifeless, much of the Day. Thus my Days roll away, with but little done for God; and this is my Burden.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 6. Was perplexed to see the Vanity and Levity of professed Christians. Spent the Evening with a Chris|tian Friend, that was able in some Measure to sympathize with

me in my spiritual Conflicts. Was a little refresh'd to find one with whom I could converse of <HI>inward Trials,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 7. Spent the Evening in Perplexity, with a Kind of guilty Indolence. When I have no Heart or Resolution for God and the Duties incumbent on me, I feel guilty of Negligence and Misimprovement of Time. Certainly I ought to be engaged in my Work and Business, to the utmost Extent of my Strength and Ability.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 8. My Mind was much distracted with different Affections. Seem'd to be at an amazing Distance from God: and looking round in the World, to see if there was not some Happiness to be derived from it, GOD, and some certain Objects in the World, seem'd each to invite my Heart and Af|fections; and my Soul seem'd to be distracted between them. I have not been so much beset with the World for a long Time; and that with Relation to some particular Objects which I thought my self most dead to. But even while I was desiring to please my self with any Thing below, Guilt, Sorrow and Perplexity attended the first Motions of Desire. Indeed I can't see the Appearance of Pleasure and Happiness in the World, as I used to do: And blessed be God for any Habitual Deadness to the World.&mdash; I found no Peace, or Deliverance from this Distraction and Perplexity of Mind, 'till I found Access to the Throne of Grace: And as soon as I had any Sense of God and Things di|vine, the Allurements of the World vanish'd, and my Heart was determined for God. But my Soul mourned over my Folly, that I should desire any Pleasure, but only in God. God forgive my spiritual Idolatry.</P>
<P>[The next thirteen Days, he appears to have been continually in deep Concern about the Improvement of precious Time; and there are many Expressions of Grief, that he improved Time no better; such as, <HI>Oh, what Misery do I feel, when my Thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> after Vanity!

<P>Thursday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 22. Spent this Day alone in Fasting and Prayer, and Reading in God's Word the Exercises and Deli|verances of God's Children. Had, I trust, some Exercise of Faith and realizing Apprehension of divine Power, Grace and

Holiness; and also of the Unchangeableness of God, that he is the same as he was when he delivered his Saints of old out of great Tribulation. My Soul was sundry Times in Prayer en|larged for God's Church and People.

<P>Friday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 23. Felt a little more Courage and Resolu|tion in Religion, than at some other Times.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 24. Had some Assistance, and longing Desires after Sanctification, in Prayer this Day; especially in the Evening: Was sensible of my own Weakness and spiritual Im|potency: Saw plainly, I should fall into Sin, if God of his abun|dant Mercy did not <HI>uphold my Soul,</HI> and <HI>withold me from Evil.</HI> O that God would <HI>uphold me by his free Spirit,</HI> and <HI>save me from the Hour of Temptation.</HI></P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 25. Pray'd much, in the Morning, with a feeling Sense of my own spiritual Weakness and Insufficiency for any Duty. God gave me some Assistance in Preaching to the <HI>Indians</HI>; and especially in the Afternoon, when I was ena|bled to speak with uncommon Plainness, Freedom, and Ear|nestness. Blessed be God for any Assistance granted to one so unworthy. Afterwards felt some Thankfulness; but still sen|sible of Barrenness.&mdash; Spent some Time in the Evening, with one or two Persons under spiritual Concern, and exhorting others to their Duty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 26. Rode down to <HI>Stockbridge.</HI> Was very much fatigued with my Journey, wherein I underwent great Hardship: Was much exposed and very wet by falling into a River. Spent the Day and Evening without much Sense of divine and heavenly Things; But felt guilty, griev'd, and per|plex'd with wandring careless Thoughts.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 27. Had a small Degree of Warmth in secret Prayer, in the Evening: but, alas, had but little spiritual Life, and consequently but little Comfort!

<P>Friday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 30. Was in a solemn devout Frame in the Evening. Wonder'd that Earth, with all its Charms, should ever allure me in the least Degree. O that I could always reali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Being and Holiness of God.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 31. Rode from <HI>Stockbridge</HI> home to my House: The Air was clear and Calm, but as Cold as ever I felt it in the World, or near. I was in great Danger of perishing by the Extremity of the Season.&mdash; Was enabled to Meditate much on the Road.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>January</HI> 1. 1743, 4. In the Morning, had some small Degree of Assistance in Prayer. Saw my self so vile and unworthy, that I could not look my People in the Face, when I came to Preach.

<P>Monday, <HI>Jan.</HI> 2. Had some affecting Sense of my own Im|potency and spiritual Weakness.&mdash; 'Tis nothing but the Power of God that keeps me from all Manner of Wickedness.

<P>Tuesday, <HI>Jan.</HI> 3. Was employed much of the Day in Writ|ing; and spent some Time in other necessary Employment. But my Time passes away so swiftly, that I am astonished when I reflect on it, and see how little I do in it. My State of Solitude does not make the Hours hang heavy upon my Hands. O what Reason of Thankfulness have I, on account of this Retirement! I find, that I <HI>don't,</HI> and it seems I <HI>can't,</HI> lead a <HI>Christian</HI> Life, when I am abroad, and can't spend Time in Devotion, Chris|tian Conversation, and Serious Meditation, as I should do. Those Weeks that I am obliged now to be from home, in order to learn the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue, are mostly spent in Perplexity &amp; Barren|ness, without much sweet Relish of divine Things; and I feel my self a Stranger at the Throne of Grace, for want of more frequent and continued Retirement. When I return Home, and give my self to Meditation, Prayer, and Fasting, a new Scene opens to my Mind, and my Soul longs for Mortification, Self-denial, Humility, and Divorcement from all the Things of the World. This Evening, my Heart was somewhat warm and fervent in Prayer and Meditation, so that I was loth to indulge Sleep. Con|tinued in those Duties 'till about Midnight.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Jan.</HI> 4. Was in a resigned and mortified Temper of Mind, much of the Day. Time appeared a <HI>Moment,</HI> Life a <HI>Vapour,</HI> and all its Enjoyments as empty Bubbles, and fleeting Blasts of Wind.</P>

This Morning, enjoyed a most solemn Season in Prayer&middot; My Soul seem'd enlarged and assisted to pour out it self to God for Grace, and for every Blessing I wanted, for my self, my dear Christian Friends, and for the Church of God; and was so enabled to <HI>see him who is invisible,</HI> that my Soul <HI>rested upon him</HI> for the Performance of every Thing I asked agreable to his Will. It was then my Happiness, to <HI>continue instant in Prayer,</HI> and was enabled to continue in it for near an Hour.

<P>Monday, <HI>Jan.</HI> 23. I think I never felt more resigned to God, nor so much dead to the World, in every Respect, as now: Was dead to all Desire of Reputation and Greatness, either in Life or after Death: All I longed for, was to be holy, humble, crucified to the World <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

Illustrated this by that genuine Love that is found between the Sexes; which is diverse from that which is wrought up towards a Person only by rational Arguments, or Hope of Self-Interest.

<P>Felt something spiritual, devout, resigned, and mortified to the World, much of the Day; and especially towards and in the Evening. Blessed be God, that he enables me to love him for himself.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 8. Was in a comfortable Frame of Soul, most of the Day; tho' sensible of and restless under spiritual Bar|renness. I find that both Mind and Body are quickly tired with Intenseness and Fervour in the Things of God. O that I could be as incessant as <HI>Angels</HI> in Devotion and spiritual Fervour.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="006311_0132_0000000000000000">Thursday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 9. Observed this Day as a Day of Fasting and Prayer, intreating of God to bestow upon me his Blessing and Grace; especially to enable me to live a Life of Mortification to the World, as well as of Resignation and Patience. Enjoy'd some realizing Sense of divine Power and Goodness in Prayer, several Times; and was enabled to roll the Burden of my self and Friends, and of <HI>Zion,</HI> upon the Goodness and Grace of God: But, in the general, was more dry and barren than I have usually been of late upon such Occasions.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 10. Was exceedingly oppress'd, most of the Day, with Shame, Grief and Fear, under a Sense of my past Folly, as well as present Barrenness and Coldness. When God sets be|fore me my past Misconduct, especially any Instances of <HI>misguid|ed Zeal,</HI> it sinks my Soul into Shame and Confusion, makes me afraid of a shaking Leaf. My Fear is such as the Prophet <HI>Jere|my</HI> complains of, <HI>Jer.</HI> xx.10.&mdash; I have no Confidence to hold up my Face, even before my Fellow-Worms; but only when my Soul confides in God, and I find the sweet Temper of Christ, the Spirit of Humility, Solemnity, and Mortification, and Re|signation, alive in my Soul.&mdash; But, in the Evening, was unex|pectedly refresh'd in <HI>pouring out my Complaint to God</HI>: My Shame and Fear was turned into a sweet Composure and Acquiescence in God.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 11. Felt much as Yesterday: enjoyed but little sensible Communion with God.</P>
<P>Lords-Day, <HI>Feb.</HI> 12. My Soul seem'd to confide in God, and to repose itself on him; and had out-goings of Soul after God in Prayer. Enjoyed some divine Assistance, in the Forenoon, in Preaching; but in the Afternoon, was more perplex'd with Shame <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Afterwards, found some Relief in Prayer: Lov'd, as a feeble afflicted despised Creature, to cast myself on a God of infi|nite Grace and Goodness, hoping for no Happiness but from him.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 13. Was Calm and Sedate in Morning-Devo|tions; and my Soul seem'd to rely on God.&mdash; Rode to <HI>Stock|bridge,</HI> and enjoy'd some comfortable Meditations by the Way: Had a more refreshing Taste and Relish of heavenly Blessedness, than I have enjoy'd for many Months past. I have many Times, of late, felt as ardent Desires of Holiness as ever: But not so much Sense of the Sweetness and unspeakable Pleasure of the En|joyments and Employments of Heaven. My Soul longed to leave Earth, and bear a Part with Angels in their celestial Em|ployments. My Soul said, <HI>Lord, it is good to be here</HI>; and it appeared to me better to die, than to lose the Relish of these heavenly Delights.</P>

<P>Wednesday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 22. In the Morning, had as clear a Sense of the exceeding Pollution of my Nature, as ever I remember to have had in my Life.

<P>Thursday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 23. Was frequent in Prayer, and enjoyed some Assistance.&mdash; <HI>There is a God in Heaven,</HI> that over-rules all Things for the best; and this is the Comfort of my Soul: <HI>I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the Goodness of God in the Land of the Living,</HI> notwithstanding present Sorrows.&mdash; In the Even|ing, enjoyed some Freedom in Prayer, for my self, Friends, and the Church of God.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 24. Was exceeding restless and perplex'd under a Sense of the Misimprovement of Time; Mourn'd to see Time pass away; Felt in the greatest Hurry; seem'd to have every Thing to do: Yet could do Nothing, but only grieve and groan under my Ignorance, Unprofitableness, Meanness, the Foolish|ness of my Actions and Thoughts, the Pride and Bitterness of my past Frames (at some Times, at least) all which at this Time appear'd to me in lively Colours, and fill'd me with Shame I could not compose my Mind to any profitable Studies, by Rea|son of this Pressure. And the Reason, I judge, why I am not allowed to Study, a great Part of my Time, is, because I am endeavouring to lay in such a Stock of Knowledge, as shall be a Self-Sufficiency.&mdash; I know it to be my indispensable Duty to Study, and qualify my self in the best Manner I can for publick Service: But this is my Misery, I naturally Study and prepare, that I may <HI>consume it upon my Lusts</HI> of Pride and Self-Confidence.</P>

<P>Friday, <HI>March</HI> 2. Was most of the Day employed in Writ|ing on a divine Subject. Was frequent in Prayer, and enjoy'd some small Degree of Assistance. But in the Evening, God was pleased to grant me a divine Sweetness in Prayer; especially in the Duty of Intercession. I think, I never felt so much Kind|ness and Love to those who I have Reason to think are my Enemies (tho' at that Time I found such a Disposition to think the best of all, that I scarce knew how to think that any such Thing as Enmity and Hatred lodg'd in any Soul; it seem'd as if all the World must needs be Friends) and never pray'd with more Freedom and Delight, for my self, or dearest Friend, than I did now for my Enemies.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>March</HI> 3. In the Morning, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> (I believe) an Hour in Prayer, with great Intenseness and Freedom, and with the most soft and tender Affection towards Mankind. I longed that those who I have Reason to think owe me Ill-Will, might be eternally happy: It seem'd refreshing, to think of meeting them in Heaven, how much soever they had injured me on Earth: Had no Disposition to insist upon any Confession from them, in order to Reconciliation &amp; the Exercise of Love &amp; Kindness to them. O 'tis an Emblem of Heaven it self, to love all the World with a Love of Kindness, Forgiveness, and Benevolence; To feel our Souls sedate, mild and meek; to be void of all evil Surmisings and Suspicions, and scarce able to think Evil of any Man upon any Occasion; To find our Hearts simple, open, and free, to those that look upon us with a different Eye!&mdash; Prayer was so sweet an Exercise to me, that I knew not how to cease, lest I should lose the Spirit of Prayer. Felt no Disposition to eat or drink, for the sake of the Pleasure of it, but only to support my Na|ture, and fit me for divine Service. Could not be content without a very particular mention of a great Number of dear Friends at the Throne of Grace; as also the particular Circum|stances of many, so far as they were known.</P>
<P>Lords-Day, <HI>Nov.</HI> 4. In the Morning, enjoyed the same In|tenseness in Prayer as Yesterday-Morning; tho' not in so great a Degree: Felt the same Spirit of Love, universal Benevolence, Forgiveness, Humility, Resignation, Mortification to the World, and Composure of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, as then. <HI>My Soul rested in</HI> GOD; and

I found, I wanted no other Refuge or Friend. While my Soul thus trusts in God, all Things seem to be at Peace with me, even the Stones of the Earth: But when I can't apprehend and confide in God, all Things appear with a different Aspect.</P>

<P>Saturday, <HI>March</HI> 10. In the Morning, felt exceeding dead to the World and all its Enjoyments: I thought, I was ready and willing to give up Life and all its Comforts, as soon as called to it: And yet then had as much Comfort of Life as almost ever I had. Life itself now appeared but an empty Bubble: The Riches, Honours, and common Enjoyments of Life appear'd ex|tremely tastless. I longed to be perpetually and entirely <HI>crucified</HI> to all Things here below, by the <HI>Cross of Christ.</HI> My Soul was sweetly resigned to God's Disposal of me, in every Regard; and I saw, there had nothing happen'd to me but what was best for me. I confided in God, that he would <HI>never leave me,</HI> tho' I should <HI>walk thro' the Valley of the Shadow of Death.</HI> It was then <HI>my Meat and Drink</HI> to be holy, to <HI>live to the Lord,</HI> and <HI>die to the Lord:</HI> And I thought, that I then enjoyed such a Heaven, as far exceeded the most sublime Conceptions of anunregenerate Soul; and even unspeakably beyond what I my self could con|ceive of at another Time. I did not wonder, that <HI>Peter</HI> said, <HI>Lord, it is good to be here,</HI> when thus refresh'd with divine Glories. My Soul was full of Love and Tenderness in the Duty of Inter|cession; especially felt a most sweet Affection to some precious godly Ministers, of my Acquaintance. Pray'd earnestly for dear Christians, and for those I have Reason to fear are my Ene|mies: And could not have spoken a Word of Bitterness, or entertained a bitter Thought, against the vilest Man living. Had a Sense of my own great Unworthiness. My Soul seem'd to breath forth Love and Praise to God afresh, when I thought he would let his Children love and receive me as one of their Bre|thren and Fellow-Citizens: And when I thought of their treat|ing me in that Manner, I longed to lie at their Feet; and could think of no Way to express the Sincerity &amp; Simplicity of my Love

<P>Lords-Day, <HI>March</HI> 11.

<P>Monday, <HI>March</HI> 12.

<P>Tuesday, <HI>March</HI> 13. Felt my Soul going forth after God sometimes; but not with such Ardency as I longed for.

Truly the <HI>Joy of the Lord</HI> is <HI>Strength</HI> and <HI>Life.</HI></P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>March</HI> 14. Enjoy'd some Intenseness of Soul in Prayer, repeating my Petitions for God's Presence in every Place where I expected to be in my Journey. Besought the Lord that I might not be too much pleased and amused with dear Friends and Acquaintance, in one Place and another.&mdash; Near <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> set out on my Journey, and near Night came to <HI>Stockbridge.</HI></P>

<P>[The two next Days, he went no further than <HI>Salisbury,</HI> being much hinder'd by the Rain. When he came there, he was much indisposed.&mdash; He speaks of comfortable and profitable Conversation with Christian Friends, on these Days.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>March</HI> 18.

The People there were unanimous in their Desires to have him for their Pastor, and for a long Time continued in an earnest Pursuit of what they desired, and were hardly brought to relinquish their Endeavours and give up their Hopes of obtaining him. Besides the Invitation he had to <HI>Millington</HI>; which was near his native Town, and in the midst of his Friends. Nor did Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> chuse the Business of a Missionary to the <HI>Indians,</HI> rather than accept of those Invitations, because he was unacquainted with the Difficulties and Sufferings which attended such a Service: for he had had Experience of these Difficulties in Summer and Winter; having spent about a Twelve-Month in a lonely Desert among these Savages, where he had gone through extream Hardships, and been the Subject of a Train of outward and inward Sorrows, which were now fresh in his Mind. Notwithstanding all these Things, he chose still to go on with this Business; and that altho' the Place he was now going to, was at a still much greater Distance from most of his Friends, Acquain|tance, and native Land.</NOTE></P>
<P>[After this, he continued two or three Days in the <HI>Jerseys,</HI> very Ill; and then returned to <HI>New-York</HI>; and from thence into <HI>New-England</HI>; and went to his native Town of <HI>Haddam</HI>&punc; where

And he continues to cry out of his Ignorance, Meanness, and Unwor|thiness. However, he speaks of some Seasons of special Assist|ance and divine Sweetness.&mdash; He spent some Days among his Friends at <HI>East-Hampton</HI> and <HI>Millington.</HI>]</P>

<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>May</HI> 13. Rose early: Felt very poorly after my long Journey, and after being wet and fatigued. Was very Melancholy; have scarce ever seen such a gloomy Morning in my Life; there appeared to be no <HI>Sabbath</HI>; the Children were all at Play; I a Stranger in the Wilderness, and knew not where to go; and all Circumstances seem'd to conspire to render my Affairs dark and discouraging. Was disappointed respecting an <HI>Interpreter,</HI> and heard that the <HI>Indians</HI> were much scatter'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Oh, I mourned after the Presence of God, and seem'd like a Creature banish'd from his Sight! Yet he was pleased to support my sinking Soul, amidst all my Sorrows; so that I never enter|tained any Thought of quitting my Business among the poor <HI>Indians</HI>; but was comforted, to think, that Death would 'ere long s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t me free from these Distresses.&mdash; Rode about 3 or 4 Miles to the <HI>Irish</HI> People, where I found some that appeared Sober and concerned about Religion. My Heart then began to be a little encouraged: Went and preach'd, first to the <HI>Irish,</HI> and then to the <HI>Indians</HI>: And in the Evening, was a little comforted; my Soul seem'd to rest on God, and take Courage. O that the Lord would be my Support and Comforter in an Evil World.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>May</HI> 14. Was very busy in some necessary Studies. Felt my self very loose from all the World: All appeared <HI>Vanity and Vexation of Spirit.</HI> Seem'd something lonesom and discon|solate, as if I was banish'd from all Mankind, and bereaved of all that is called pleasurable in the World: But appeared to my self so vile and unworthy, it seem'd fitter for me to be here than any where.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>May</HI> 15. Still much engaged in my Studies; and enjoyed more Health, than I have for some Time past: But was something dejected in Spirit with a Sense of my Meanness&punc; seem'd as if I could never do any Thing at all to any good Pur|pose by Reason of Ignorance and Folly. O that a Sense of these Things might work more habitual Humility in my Soul.</P>

<P>Thursday, <HI>May</HI> 17. Was this Day greatly distress'd with a Sense of my Vileness: Appeared to my self too bad to walk on God's Earth, or to be treated with Kindness by any of his Crea|tures. God was pleased to let me see my inward Pollution and Corruption, to such a Degree, that I almost despair'd of being made holy: <HI>Oh! wretched Man that I am!

<P>Friday, <HI>May</HI> 18.

O that I could always live <HI>to</HI> and <HI>upon</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>May</HI> 19. Was, some Part of the Time, greatly oppress'd with the Weight and Burden of my Work: It seem'd impossible for me ever to go thro' with the Business I had under|taken.&mdash;Towards Night, was very calm and comfortable; And I think, my Soul trusted in God for Help.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>May</HI> 20. Preach'd twice to the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> and enjoyed some Freedom in speaking, while I attempted to remove their Prejudices against Christianity. My Soul longed for Assistance from above, all the while; for I saw I had no Strength sufficient for that Work. Afterwards, preach'd to the <HI>Irish</HI> People: Was much assisted in the first Prayer, and something in Sermon.

<P>WEdnesday, <HI>June</HI> 13. Spent some considerable Time in writing an Account of the <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs to go to <HI>Scot|land</HI>; spent some Time in Conversation with Friends; But enjoy'd not much Sweetness and Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>June</HI> 14. Received some particular Kindness from Friends; and wondered, that God should open the Hearts of any to treat me with Kindness: Saw my self to be unworthy of any Favour, from God, or any of my Fellow-Men. Was much exercised with Pain in my Head; however determined to set out on my Journey towards <HI>Delaware</HI> in the Afternoon: But in the Afternoon my Pain increased exceedingly; so that I was ob|liged to betake my self to the Bed; and the Night following, was greatly distress'd with Pain and Sickness: Was sometimes almost bereaved of the Exercise of Reason by the Extremity of Pain. Continued much Distress'd 'till Saturday; when I was something reliev'd by an Emetick: But was unable to walk abroad 'till the Monday following, in the Afternoon; and still remain'd very feeble. I often admired the Goodness of God, that he did not suffer me to proceed on my Journey from this Place where I was so tenderly used, and to be Sick by the Way among Strangers.&mdash; God is very gracious to me, both in Health and Sickness, and intermingles much Mercy with all my Afflictions and Toils.

<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>June</HI> 24.

My Heart was much engaged in Prayer, sending up silent Requests to God, even while I was speaking to them. O that I could always go in the Strength of the Lord.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>June</HI> 25. Was something better in Health <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of late: Was able to spend a considerable Part of the Day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Prayer and close Studies. Had more Freedom and Fervency in Prayer than usual of late: Especially long'd for the Presence of God in my Work, and that the poor Heathen might be con|verted. And in Evening-Prayer my Faith and Hope in God were much raised. To an Eye of Reason every Thing that respects the Conversion of the Heathen is as dark as Midnight; and yet I can't but hope in God for the Accomplishment of something glorious among them. My Soul longed much for the Advancement of the Redeemer's Kingdom on Earth. Was very fearful lest I should admit some vain Thought, and so lose the Sense I then had of divine Things. O for an abiding hea|venly Temper!</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>June</HI> 26. In the Morning, my Desires seem'd to rise, and ascend up freely to God. Was busy most of the Day is translating Prayers into the Language of the <HI>Delaware-Indians</HI>: Met with great Difficulty by Reason that my Interpreter was altogether unacquainted with the Business. But tho' I was much discouraged with the extream Difficulty of that Work, yet God supported me; and especially in the Evening, gave me sweet Refreshment: In Prayer my Soul was enlarged, and my Faith drawn into sensible Exercise; was enabled to cry to God for my poor <HI>Indians</HI>; and tho' the Work of their Conversion appeared <HI>impossible with Man, yet with God</HI> I saw <HI>all Things were possible.</HI> My Faith was much strengthen'd, by observing the
<PB N="115" REF="006311_0148_0000000000000000">
wonderful Assistance God afforded his Servants <HI>Nehemiah</HI> and <HI>Ezra,</HI> in reforming his People, and re-establishing his antient Church. I was much assisted in Prayer for dear Christian Friends, and for others that I apprehended to be Christless; but was more especially concerned for the poor Heathen, and those of my own Charge: Was enabled to be instant in Prayer for them; and hoped that God would bow the Heavens and come down for their Salvation. It seem'd to me, there could be no Impediment sufficient to obstruct that glorious Work, seeing the living God, as I strongly hoped, was engaged for it. I continued in a solemn Frame, lifting up my Heart to God for Assistance, and Grace, that I might be more mortified to this present World, that my whole Soul might be taken up conti|nually in Concern for the Advancement of Christ's Kingdom: Longed that God would purge me more, that I might be as a chosen Vessel to bear his Name among the Heathens. Continued in this Frame 'till I drop'd asleep.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>June</HI> 27. Felt something of the same solemn Concern, and Spirit of Prayer, that I enjoy'd last Night, soon after I rose in the Morning.&mdash; In the Afternoon, rode several Miles to see if I could procure any Lands for the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> that they might live together, and be under better Advantages for Instruction. While I was riding, had a deep Sense of the Greatness and Difficulty of my Work; and my Soul seemed to rely wholly upon God for Success, in the diligent and faith|ful use of Means. Saw, with greatest Certainty, that <HI>the Arm of the Lord</HI> must be <HI>revealed,</HI> for the Help of these poor Hea|then, if ever they were delivered from the Bondage of the Pow|ers of Darkness. Spent most of the Time, while riding, in lifting up my Heart for Grace and Assistance.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>June</HI> 28. Spent the Morning, in reading several Parts of the Holy Scripture, and in fervent Prayer for my <HI>In|dians,</HI> that God would set up his Kingdom among them, and bring them into his Church.&mdash; About nine, I withdrew to my usual Place of Retirement in the Woods; and there again enjoyed some Assistance in Prayer. My great Concern was for the Conversion of the Heathen to God; and the Lord helped me to plead with him for it. Towards Noon, rode up to the <HI>Indians,</HI> in order to preach to 'em; and while going, my Heart went up to God in Prayer for 'em; could freely tell God, He knew that the Cause was not mine, which I was engaged in; but it was his own Cause, and it would be for his own Glory to convert the poor <HI>Indians</HI>: And blessed be God, I felt no Desire

<P>[The next Day, he speaks of some serious Concern for the Kingdom of the blessed Redeemer; but complains much of Barrenness, Wandrings, Inactivity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>June</HI> 30. My Soul was much Solemnized in read|ing God's Word; especially the ninth Chapter of <HI>Daniel.</HI> I saw how God had called out his Servants to Prayer, and made them wrestle with him, when he designed to bestow any great Mer|cy on his Church. And alas, I was ashamed of my self, to think of my Dulness and Inactivity, when there seemed to be so much to do for the upbuilding of <HI>Zion.</HI> Oh, how does <HI>Zion</HI> lie waste! I longed, that the Church of God might be enlarged: Was ena|bled to pray, I think, in Faith: My Soul seem'd sensibly to confide in God, and was enabled to wrestle with him. After|wards, walk'd Abroad to a Place of sweet Retirement, and en|joyed some Assistance in Prayer again: Had a Sense of my great need of divine Help, and felt my Soul sensibly depend on God. Blessed be God, this has been a comfortable Week to me.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day <HI>July</HI> 1. In the Morning, was perplex'd with wandring vain Thoughts: Was much grieved, judged and condemned my self before God. And Oh, how miserable did I feel, because I could not live to God! At ten, rode away with a heavy Heart, to preach to my <HI>Indians.</HI> Upon the Road, I attempted to lift up my Heaat to God; but was infested with an unsettled wandring Frame of Mind; and was exceeding restless and perplex'd, and fill'd with Shame and Confusion be|fore God. I seem'd to my self to be <HI>more brutish than any Man</HI>; and thought, none deserved to be <HI>cast out of God'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Presence</HI> so much as I. If I attempted to lift up my Heart to God, as I frequently did by the Way, on a sudden, before I was aware, my Thoughts were wandring <HI>to the Ends of the Earth</HI>: And my Soul was fill'd with Surprize and Anxiety, to find it thus. Thus also after I came to the <HI>Indians,</HI> my Mind was confused; and I felt nothing sensibly of that sweet Reliance on God, that my Soul has been comforted with in Days past. Spent the Forenoon in this Posture of Mind, and preach'd to the <HI>Indians</HI> without any Heart. In the Afternoon, I felt still barren, when I began to preach; and after about half an Hour, I seem'd to my self to know nothing, and to have nothing to say to the <HI>Indians</HI>; but
<PB N="117" REF="006311_0150_0000000000000000">
soon after, I found in my self a Spirit of Love, and Warmth, and Power to address the poor <HI>Indians</HI>; and God helped me to plead with them to <HI>turn from all the Vanities of the Heathen, to the living God</HI>: And I am perswaded, the Lord touch'd their Consciences; for I never saw such Attention raised in them be|fore. And when I came away from them, I spent the whole Time while I was riding to my Lodgings, three Miles distant, in Prayer and Praise to God. And after I had rode more than two Miles, it came into my Mind to dedicate my self to God again; which I did with great Solemnity, and unspeakable Satisfaction; especially gave up my self to him renewedly in the Work of the Ministry. And this I did by divine Grace, I hope, without any Exception or Reserve; not in the least shrinking back from any Difficulties, that might attend this great and blessed Work. I seem'd to be most free, chearful, and full in this Dedication of my self. My whole Soul cried,
<Q>Lord, to thee I dedicate my self: O accept of me, and let me be thine forever. Lord, I desire nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lse; I desire nothing more. O come, come, Lord, accept a poor Worm. <HI>Whom have I in Heaven, but thee; and there is none upon Earth, that I desire besides thee.</HI></Q>
After this, was enabled to praise God with my whole Soul, that he had enabled me to devote and consecrate all my Powers to him in this solemn Man|ner. My Heart rejoyced in my particular Work as a <HI>Missio|nary</HI>; rejoyced in my Necessity of Self-denial in many Respects; and still continued to give up my self to God, and implore Mer|cy of him; praying incessantly, every Moment, with sweet Fervency. My Nature being very weak of late, and much spent, was now considerably overcome: My Fingers grew very feeble, and somewhat numb; so that I could scarcely stretch them out streight: And when I lighted from my Horse, could hardly walk: My Joints seem'd all to be loosed. But I felt abundant <HI>Stre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gth in the inner Man.</HI> Preach'd to the White People: God helped me much, especially in Prayer. Sundry of my poor <HI>Indians</HI> were so moved as to come to Meet|ing also; and one appeared much concerned.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>July</HI> 2. Had some Relish of the divine Comforts of Yesterday; but could not get that Warmth and Exercise of Faith, that I desired. Had sometimes a distressing Sense of my past Follies, and present Ignorance and Barrenness: And especially in the Afternoon, was sunk down under a L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad of Sin and Guilt, in that I had lived so little to God, after his abun|dant Goodness to me Yesterday. In the Evening, tho' very

weak, was enabled to pray with Fervency, and to continue in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stant in Prayer, near an Hour. My Soul mourned over the Power of its Corruption, and longed exceedingly to be <HI>wash'd</HI> and <HI>purged as with Hyssop.</HI> Was enabled to pray for my dear absent Friends, Christ's Ministers, and his Church; and enjoyed much Freedom and Fervency, but not so much Comfort, by Reason of Guilt and Shame before God.&mdash; Judged and condemned my self for the Follies of the Day.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>July</HI> 3. Was still very weak. This Morning, was enabled to pray under a feeling Sense of my need of Help from God, and, I trust, had some Faith in Exercise; and, blessed be God, was enabled to plead with God a considerable Time. Truly God is good to me. But my Soul mourned and was grieved at my Sinfulness and Barrenness, and long'd to be more engaged for God. Near nine, withdrew again for Prayer; and thro' divine Goodness, had the blessed Spirit of Prayer; my Soul loved the Duty, and longed for God in it. O it is sweet to be <HI>the Lord</HI>'s, to be sensibly devoted to him! What a blessed Portion is God! How glorious, how lovely in himself! O my Soul long'd to improve Time wholly for God!&mdash; Spent most of the Day in translating Prayers into <HI>Indian.</HI>&mdash; In the Evening, was enabled again to wrestle with God in Prayer with Fervency. Was enabled to maintain a Self-diffident and watch|ful Frame of Spirit, in the Evening, and was jealous and afraid lest I should admit Carelesness and Self-Confidence.</P>
<P>[The next Day, he seems to have had special Assistance and Fervency most of the Day, but in a less Degree than the preceed|ing Day. Thursday was spent in great bodily Weakness; yet seems to have been spent in continual and exceeding Painful|ness in Religion; but in great Bitterness of Spirit by Reason of his Vileness and Corruption; he says thus, <HI>I thought there was not one Creature living so vile as I.

<P>Friday, <HI>July</HI> 6. Awoke this Morning in the Fear of God: Soon called to Mind my Sadness in the Evening past; and spent my first waking Minutes in Prayer for Sanctification, that my Soul might be wash'd from its exceeding Pollution and Defile|ment. After I arose, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> spent some Time in reading God's Word
<PB N="119" REF="006311_0152_0000000000000000">
and Prayer: I cried to God under a Sense of my great Indigen|cy.&mdash; I am, of late, most of all concerned for Ministerial Quali|fications, and the Conversion of the Heathen: Last Year, I longed to be prepared for a World of <HI>Glory,</HI> and speedily to de|part out of this World; but of late all my Concern almost is for the Conversion of the Heathen; and for that End, I long to live. But blessed be God, I have less desire to live for any of the Pleasures of the World, than ever I had: I long and love to be a <HI>Pilgrim</HI>; and want Grace to imitate the Life, Labours and Sufferings of St. <HI>Paul</HI> among the Heathen. And when I long for Holiness now, it is not so much for my self as formerly; but rather that thereby I may become an <HI>able Minister of the New-Testament,</HI> especially to the Heathen. Spent about two Hours this Morning in Reading and Prayer by Turns; and was in a watchful tender Frame, afraid of every Thing that might cool my Affections, and draw away my Heart from God. Was something strengthen'd in my Studies; but near Night was very weak and weary.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>July</HI> 7. Was very much disordered this Morning, and my Vigour all spent and exhausted: But was affected and refresh'd in reading the sweet Story of <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Translation, and enjoyed some Affection and Fervency in Prayer; longed much for Ministerial Gifts and Graces, that I might do something in the Cause of God. Afterwards was refresh'd and invigorated, while reading Mr. <HI>Joseph Alleine's</HI> first Case of Conscience, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and enabled then to pray with some Ardour of Soul, and was afraid of Carelesness and Self-Confidence, and longed for Holiness.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>July</HI> 8. Was ill last Night, not able to rest quietly. Had some small Degree of Assistance in preaching to the <HI>Indians</HI>; and afterwards was enabled to preach to the White People with some Power, especially in the Close of my Discourse from <HI>Jer.</HI> iii.23. The Lord also assisted me in some Measure in the first Prayer: Blessed be his Name. Near Night, tho' very weary, was enabled to read God's Word with some sweet Relish of it, and to pray with Affection, Fervency, and (I trust) Faith: My Soul was more sensibly dependent on God, than usual. Was watchful, tender, and jealous of my own Heart, lest I should admit C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">elesness and vain Thoughts, and grieve the blessed Spirit, so that he should withdraw his sweet, kind, and tender Influences. Long'd to <HI>depart and be with Christ,</HI> more than at any Time of late. My Soul was exceedingly united to the Saints of antient Times, as well as those now living; espe|cially my Soul melted for the Society of <HI>Elijah</HI> and <HI>Elisha.</HI>

Was enabled to cry to God with a Child-like Spirit, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> continue instant in Prayer for some Time. Was much enlarged in the sweet Duty of Intercession: Was enabled to remember great Numbers of dear Friends, and precious Souls, as well as Christ's Ministers. Continued in this Frame, afraid of every idle Thought, 'till I drop'd asleep.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>July</HI> 9. Was under much illness of Body most of the Day, and notable to sit up the whole Day. Towards Night, felt a little better. Then spent some Time in reading God's Word and Prayer: Enjoy'd some Degree of Fervency and Af|fection: Was enabled to plead with God for his Cause and Kingdom: And, thro' divine Goodness, It was apparent to me that it was his Cause I pleaded for, and not my own: And was enabled to make this an Argument with God to answer my Requests.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>July</HI> 10. Was very ill and full of Pain, and very dull and spiritless.&mdash; In the Evening, had an affecting Sense of my Ignorance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and of my need of God at all Times, to do every Thing for me; and my Soul was humbled before God.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>July</HI> 11. Was still exercised with Illness and Pain. Had some Degree of Affection and Warmth in Pray|er and reading God's Word: Long'd for <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Faith and Fellowship with God; and felt some Resolution to spend all my Time for God, and to exert my self with more Fervency in his Service; but found my Body weak and feeble. In the Afternoon, tho' very ill, was enabled to spend some considerable Time in Prayer; spent indeed most of the Day in that Exercise; and my Soul was diffident, watchful and tender, lest I should offend my blessed Friend, in Thought or Behaviour. I am perswaded my Soul confided in, and lean'd upon the blessed God. Oh, what need did I see my self to stand in of God at all Times, to assist me and lead me!&mdash;Found a great want of Strength and Vigour, both in the outward and inner Man.</P>
<P>[The Exercises and Experiences, that he speaks of in the next nine Days, are very Similar to those of the preceeding Days, of this and the foregoing Week; a Sense of his own Weakness, Igno|rance, Unprofitableness, and Vileness; loathing and abhorring himself; Self-diffidence; Sense of the Greatness of his Work, and his great need of divine Help, and the extream Danger of Self-Confidence; longing for Holiness and Humility, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be fitted for his Work; and to live to God; and longing for the Conversion of the <HI>Indians</HI>; and these Things to a very great Degree.]</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="006311_0154_0000000000000000">Saturday, <HI>July</HI> 21. This Morning, was greatly oppressed with Guilt and Shame, from a Sense of inward Vileness and Pollution. About nine, withdrew to the Woods for Prayer; but had not much Comfort; I appeared to my self the vilest meanest Creature upon Earth, and could scarcely live with my self; so mean and vile I appeared, that I thought I should never be able to hold up my Face in Heaven, if God of his infinite Grace should bring me thither. Towards Night my Burden respecting my Work among the <HI>Indians</HI> began to increase much; and was aggravated by hearing sundry Things that look'd very discouraging, in particular that they intended to meet together the next Day for an <HI>idolatrous Feast and Dance.</HI> Then I began to be in Anguish: I thought I must in Conscience go and en|deavour to break them up; and knew not how to attempt such a Thing. However I withdrew for Prayer, hoping for Strength from above. And in Prayer I was exceedingly enlarged, and my Soul was as much drawn out as ever I remember it to have been in my Life, or near. I was in such Anguish, and pleaded with so much Earnestness and Importunity, that when I rose from my Knees I felt extreamly weak and overcome, I could scarcely walk strait, my Joints were loosed, the sweat ran down my Face and Body, &amp; Nature seem'd as if it would dissolve. So far as I could judge, I was wholly free from <HI>selfish Ends</HI> in my fervent Supplications for the poor <HI>Indians.</HI> I knew, they were met together to worship <HI>Devils,</HI> and not GOD; and this made me cry earnestly, that God would now appear, and help me in my Attempts to break up this idolatrous Meeting. My Soul pleaded long; and I thought, God would hear, and would go with me to vindicate his own Cause: I seem'd to confide in God for his Presence and Assistance. And thus I spent the Evening, praying incessantly for divine Assistance, and that I might not be Self-dependent, but still have my whole Depen|dance upon God. What I pass'd thro' was remarkable, and indeed inexpressible. All Things here below vanish'd; and there appear'd to be nothing of any considerable Importance to me, but Holiness of Heart and Life, and the Conversion of the Heathen to God. All my Cares, Fears and Desires, which might be said to be of a worldly Nature, disappeared; and were, in my Esteem, of little more Importance than a Puff of Wind. I exceedingly long'd, that God would <HI>get to himself a Name among the Heathen</HI>: And I appeal'd to him with the greatest Freedom, that he knew I <HI>perfer'd</HI> HIM <HI>above my chief Joy.</HI> Indeed, I had no Notion of Joy from this World: I cared
<PB N="122" REF="006311_0155_0000000000000000">
not where or how I lived, or what Hardships I went thro'; so that I could but <HI>gain Souls to</HI> CHRIST. I continued in this Frame all the Evening and Night. While I was asleep, I dream'd of these Things; and when I waked (as I frequently did) the first Thing I thought of was this great Work of plead|ing for GOD against <HI>Satan.</HI></P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>July</HI> 22. When I waked, my Soul was bur|den'd with what seemed to be before me: I cried to God, be|fore I could get out of my Bed: And as soon as I was dress'd, I withdrew into the Woods, to pour out my burden'd Soul to God, especially for Assistance in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y great Work; for I could scarcely think of any Thing else: And enjoyed the same Free|dom and Fervency as the last Evening; and did with unspeaka|ble Freedom give up my self afresh to God, for Life or Death, for all Hardships he should call me to among the Heathen; and felt as if nothing could discourage me from this blessed Work. I had a strong Hope, that God would <HI>bow the Heavens and come down,</HI> and do some <HI>marvellous Work</HI> among the Heathen. And when I was riding to the <HI>Indians,</HI> three Miles, my Heart was continually going up to God for his Presence and Assistance; and hoping, and almost expecting, that God would make this <HI>the Day of his Power</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> amongst the poor <HI>Indians.</HI> When I came to them, I found them engaged in their <HI>Frolick</HI>; but thro' divine Goodness I got them to break up, and attend to my Preaching: Yet still there appeared nothing of the special Pow|er of God among them. Preach'd again to them in the Af|ternoon; and observed, the <HI>Indians</HI> were more <HI>sober</HI> than before: But still saw nothing <HI>special</HI> among them; from whence <HI>Satan</HI> took occasion to tempt and buffet me with these cursed Suggestions, <HI>There i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no God,</HI> or if there be, he is not able to convert the <HI>Indians,</HI> before they had more Knowledge, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I was very weak and weary, and my Soul born down with Perplexity: But was mortified to all the World, and was determined still to <HI>wait upon God</HI> for the Conversion of the Heathen, tho' the Devil tempted me to the contrary.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>July</HI> 23. Retain'd still a deep and pressing Sense of what lay with so much Weight upon me Yesterday: But was more calm and quiet; enjoyed Freedom and Composure, after the Temptations of the last Evening: Had sweet Resigna|tion to the divine Will; and desired nothing so much as the Conversion of the Heathen to God, and that his Kingdom might come in my own Heart, and the Hearts of others. Rode to a Settlement of <HI>Irish</HI> People, about 15 Miles South-Westward;
<PB N="123" REF="006311_0156_0000000000000000">
spent my Time in Prayer and Meditation by the Way. Near Night, preach'd from <HI>Math.</HI> v.3.&mdash; God was pleas'd to afford me some Degree of Freedom and Fervency. Blessed be God for any Measure of Assistance.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>July</HI> 24. Rode about 17 Miles Westward, over a hideous Mountain, to a Number of <HI>Indians.</HI> Got together near 30 of 'em: Preach'd to 'em in the Evening, and lodg'd among them <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Brain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rd</HI>'s Narrative at the End of his <HI>Ordination Sermon,</HI> Page 34.</NOTE>.&mdash; Was weak, and felt something disconsolate: Yet could have no Freedom in the Thought of any other Cir|cumstances or Business in Life: All my Desire was the Conver|sion of the Heathen, and all my Hope was in God: God does not suffer me to please or comfort my self with Hopes of seeing Friends, returning to my dear Acquaintance, and enjoying worldly Comforts.</P>
<P>[The next Day, he preach'd to these <HI>Indians</HI> again; and then returned to the <HI>Irish</HI> Settlement, and there preach'd to a numerous Congregation: There was a considerable Appear|ance of Awakening in the Congregation. Thursday, he returned home, exceedingly fatigued and spent; still in the same Frame of Mortification to the World, and solicitous for the Advancement of Christ's Kingdom: And on this Day he says thus,
<Q>I have felt, this Week, more of the Spirit of a <HI>Pilgrim on Earth,</HI> than perhaps ever before; And yet so desirous to see <HI>Zion</HI>'s Prosperity, that I was not so willing to leave this Scene of Sorrow as I used to be.</Q>
&mdash; The two remaining Days of the Week, he was very ill, and cries out of Wandrings, Dulness, and want of spiritual Fervency and Sweetness. On the Sabbath, He was confined by Illness, not able to go out to preach. After this, his Illness increased upon him, and he continued very ill all the Week; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Week, on Tuesday, he wrote the 4th <HI>Letter</HI> added at the End of this Account.</NOTE> and says, that
<Q>he thought he never before endured such a Season of distressing Weakness; and that his Nature was so spent, that he could neither stand, sit, nor lie with any Quiet; and that he was exercised with extream Faintness and Sickness at his Stomach; and that his Mind was as much disorder'd as his Body, seeming to be stupid, and without all kind of Affections towards all Objects; and yet perplex'd, to think, that he lived for nothing, that preci|ous
<PB N="124" REF="006311_0157_0000000000000000">
Time roll'd away, and he could do nothing but trifle: And speaks of it as a Season wherein <HI>Satan</HI> buffeted him with some peculiar Temptations.</Q>
&mdash; Concerning the next five Days he writes thus,
<Q>On Lord's-Day <HI>Aug.</HI> 5. Was still very poor. But, tho' very weak, I visited and preach'd to the poor <HI>Indians</HI> twice, and was strengthen'd vastly beyond my Expectations. And indeed, the Lord gave me some Free|dom and Fervency in addressing them; tho' I had not Strength enough to stand, but was obliged to sit down the whole Time; Towards Night, was extreamly weak, faint, sick and full of Pain. And thus I have continued much in the same State that I was in last Week, through the most of this (it being now Friday;) unable to engage in any Business; frequently unable to pray in the Family. I am obliged to let all my Thoughts and Concerns run at Random; for I have neither Strength to read, meditate, or pray: And this naturally per|plexes my Mind. I seem to my self like a Man that has all his Estate embarqued in one small Boat, unhappily going adrift, down a swift Torrent. The poor Owner stands on the Shore, and looks, and laments his Loss.&mdash; But alas, tho' my all seems to be adrift, and I stand and see it, I dare not lament; for this sinks my Spirits more, and aggravates my bodil. Disorders! I am forced therefore to divert my self with Trifles; altho' at the same Time I am afraid, and after feel as if I was guilty of the Misimprovement of Time. And oftentimes my Conscience is so exercised&punc; with this miserable Way of spending Time, that I have no Peace; tho' I have no Strength of Mind or Body to improve it to better Purpose. O that God would pity my distressed State.</Q></P>
<P>The next three Weeks after this, his Illness was not so ex|treme: He was in some Degree capable of Business, both pub|lick and private; (altho he had some Turns wherein his Indis|position prevailed to a great Degree:) He also in this Space had, for the most Part, much more inward Assistance, and Strength of Mind: He often expresses great Longings for the Enlargement of Christ's Kingdom; especially by the Conver|sion of the Heathen to God: He speaks of his Hope of this as all his Delight and Joy. He continues still to express his usual Longings after Holiness and living to God, and his Sense of his own Unworthiness: He several Times speaks of his appearing to himself the vilest Creature on Earth; and once says, that he verily tho't there were none of God's Children who fell so far short of that Holiness, and Perfection in their Obedience, which
<PB N="125" REF="006311_0158_0000000000000000">
God requires, as he. He speaks of his feeling more dead than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver to the Enjoyments of the World. He sometimes mentions special Assistance that he had in this Space of Time, in preaching to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and of Appearances of religious Concern among them. He speaks also of Assistance in Prayer for absent Friends, and especially Ministers and Candidates for the Ministry; and of much Comfort he enjoy'd in the Company of some Ministers that came to visit him.]</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 1. Was so far strengthen'd, after a Season of great Weakness, that I was able to spend two or three Hours in writing on a divine Subject. Enjoy'd some Comfort and Sweet|ness in Things divine and sacred: And as my bodily Strength was in some Measure restored, so my Soul seem'd to be some|what vigorous, and engaged in the Things of God.</P>
<P>Lords-Day, <HI>Sept.</HI> 2. Was enabled to speak to my poor <HI>Indians</HI> with much Concern and Fervency; and I am perswaded, God enabled me to exercise Faith in him, while I was speaking to them. I perceived, that some of them were afraid to hearken to, and embrace <HI>Christianity,</HI> lest they should be inchanted and poison'd by some of the <HI>Powows</HI>: But I was enabled to plead with them not to fear these; and confiding in God for Safety and Deliver|ance, I bid a Challenge to all these <HI>Powers of Darkness,</HI> to do their worst upon <HI>me</HI> first: I told my People, I was a <HI>Christian,</HI> and ask'd them why the <HI>Powows</HI> did not Bewitch and Poison me. I scarcely ever felt more sensible of my own Unworthiness, than in this Action: I saw, that the Honour of God was con|cerned in the Affair; and I desired to be preserved, not from selfish Views, but for a Testimony of the divine Power and Goodness, and of the Truth of Christianity, and that God might be glorified. Afterwards, I found my Soul rejoice in God for his assisting Grace.</P>
<P>[After this, he went a Journey into <HI>New-England,</HI> and was absent from the Place of his Abode, at the Forks of <HI>Delaware,</HI> about three Weeks. He was in a feeble State the greater Part of the Time. But in the latter Part of the Journey, he found he gained much in Health and Strength. And as to the State of his Mind, and his religious and spiritual Exercises, it was much with him as had been before usual in Journeys; excepting that the Frame of his Mind seemed more generally to be comfortable. But yet there are Complaints of some uncomfortable Seasons, want of Fervency, and want of Retirements, and Time alone with God. In this Journey, he did not forget the <HI>Indians</HI>; but once and again speaks of his longing for their Conversion.]</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="006311_0159_0000000000000000">Wednesday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 26. Rode Home, to the Forks of <HI>Delaware.</HI> What Reason have I to bless God, who has preserved me in rid|ing more than 420 Miles, and has <HI>kept all my Bones, that not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of them has been broken!</HI> My Health likewise is greatly recover'd. O that I could dedicate my all to God: This is all the Return I can make to him.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 27. Was something melancholy: Had not much Freedom and Comfort in Prayer: My Soul is disconso|late, when God is withdrawn.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 28. Spent the Day in Prayer, Reading, and Writing. Felt some small Degree of warmth in Prayer, and some Desires of the Enlargement of Christ's Kingdom by the Con|version of the Heathen, and that God would make me a <HI>chos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Vessel, to bear his Name before them:</HI> Longed for Grace to ena|ble me to be faithful.</P>

<P>Monday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 1. Was engaged this Day in making Prepa|ration for my intended Journey to <HI>Susquahannah</HI>: Withdrew s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|veral Times to the Woods for secret Duties, and endeavoured to plead for the divine Presence to go with me to the poor Pag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, to whom I was going to preach the Gospel.

<P>Tuesday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 2. Set out on my Journey, in Company with dear Brother <HI>Byram,</HI> and my Interpreter, and two chief <HI>Indians</HI> from the Forks of <HI>Delaware.</HI> Travelled about 25 Mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and lodged in one of the last Houses on our Road; after which there was nothing but a hideous and howling <HI>Wilderness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="006311_0160_0000000000000000">Wednesday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 3. We went on our Way into the Wilderness, and found the most difficult and dangerous travel|ling, by far, that ever any of us had seen; we had scarce any Thing else but lofty Mountains, deep Valleys, and hideous Rocks, to make our Way thro'. However, I felt some Sweetness in divine Things, part of the Day, and had my Mind intensely en|gaged in Meditation on a divine Subject. Near Night, my Beast that I rode upon, hung one of her Legs in the Rocks, and fell down under me; But thro' divine Goodness, I was not hurt. However, she broke her Leg; and being in such a hideous Place, and near 30 Miles from any House, I saw nothing that could be done to preserve her Life, and so was obliged to kill her, and to prosecute my Journey on Foot. This Accident made me ad|mire the divine Goodness to me, that my Bones were not broken, and the Multitude of 'em fill'd with strong Pain. Just at Dark, we kindled a Fire, cut up a few Bushes, and made a Shelter over our Heads, to save us from the Frost, which was very hard that Night; and committing our selves to God by Prayer, we lay down on the Ground, and slept quietly.</P>
<P>[The next Day, they went forward on their Journey, and at Night took up their Lodging in the Woods in like Manner.]</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 5. We arrived at <HI>Susquahannah</HI> River, at a Place called <HI>Opeholhaupung</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See his <HI>Narrative</HI> at the End of his <HI>Ord.

And when I had done, I asked, if they would hear me again. They reply'd, that they would consider of it; and soon after sent me Word, that they would immediately attend, if I would preach: Which I did, with Freedom, both Times. When I asked 'em again, whether they would hear me further, they reply'd, they would the next Day. I was exceeding sensible of the Impossibility of doing any Thing for the poor Heathen with|out special Assistance from above: And my Soul seem'd to rest on God, and leave it to him to do as he pleased in that which I saw was his own Cause: And indeed, thro' divine Goodness, I had felt something of this Frame most of the Time while I was travelling thither; and in some Measure before I set out.</P>

Then they went away; and we spent the rest of the Afternoon in Reading and Prayer, intending to go Home-ward very early the next Day.

But after|wards, God was pleased to give me some Relief from these Confusions: But still I was afraid, and even trembled before God. I went to the Place of publick Worship, lifting up my Heart to God for Assistance and Grace, in my great Work: And God was gracious to me, and helped me to plead with him for Holiness, and to use the strongest Arguments with him, drawn from the Incarnation and Sufferings of Christ for this very End, that Men might be made holy. Afterwards, I was much assisted in preaching. I know not that ever God helped me to preach in a more close and distinguishing Manner for the Trial of Men's State. Thro' the infinite Goodness of God, I felt what I spake; and God enabled me to treat on divine Truth with uncommon Clearness: And yet I was so sensible of my Defects in Preaching, that I could not be proud of my Performance, as at some Times; And blessed be the Lord for this Mercy.

<P>[The four next Days, were manifestly spent in a most constant Tenderness, Watchfulness, Diligence and Self-Diffidence. But he complains of Wandrings of Mind, Languor of Affections <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 24. Near Noon, rode to my People; spent some Time, and pray'd with them: Felt the Frame of a <HI>Pilgrim</HI> on Earth; longed much to leave this gloomy Mansion; but yet found the Exercise of Patience and Resignation. And as I returned home from the <HI>Indians,</HI> spent the whole Time in lifting up my Heart to God. In the Evening, enjoy'd a blessed Season alone in Prayer; was enabled to cry to God with a Child|like Spirit, for the Space of near an Hour: Enjoyed a sweet Freedom in supplicating for my self, for dear Friends, Ministers, and some who are preparing for that Work, and for the Church of God; and longed to be as lively my self in God's Service as the <HI>Angels.</HI></P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 25. Was busy in Writing. Was very sensible of my absolute Dependance on God in all Respects; saw that I could do nothing in those Affairs, that I have sufficient na|tural Faculties for, unless God should smile upon my Attempt. <HI>Not that we are sufficient of our selves, to think any Thing, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of ourselves,</HI> was a sacred Text that I saw the Truth of.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="006311_0164_0000000000000000">Friday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 26. In the Morning, my Soul was melted with a Sense of divine Goodness and Mercy to such a vile un|worthy Worm as I: Delighted to lean upon God, and place my whole Trust in him: My Soul was exceedingly grieved for Sin, and prized and longed after Holiness; it wounded my Heart deeply, yet sweetly, to think how I had abused a kind God. I longed to be perfectly Holy, that I might not grieve a gracious God; who will continue to love, notwithstanding his Love is abused: I longed for Holiness more for this End, than I did for my own Happiness sake: And yet this was my greatest Happi|ness, never more to dishonour, but always to glorify the blessed God. Afterwards, rode up to the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the Afternoon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>[The four next Days, he was exercised with much Disorder and Pain of Body, with a Degree of Melancholy and Gloominess of Mind, bitterly complaining of Deadness and Unprofitableness, yet mourning and longing after God.]</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 31. Was sensible of my Barrenness, and Decays, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Things of God: My Soul fail'd, when I remem|ber'd the Fervency I had enjoyed at the Throne of Grace. Oh (I thought) If I could but be spiritual, warm, heavenly-minded, and affectionately breathing after God, this would be better than Life to me! My Soul longed exceedingly for Death, to be loosed from this Dullness and Barrenness, and made forever active in the Service of God. I seemed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for nothing, and to do no Good: And Oh, the Burden of such a Life! Oh, Death, Death, my kind Friend, hasten and deliver me from dull Mortality, and make me spiritual and vigorous to Eternity.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>November</HI> 1. Had but little Sweetness in divine Things. But afterwards, in the Evening, felt some Life, and Longings after God; I longed to be always solemn, devout, and heavenly-minded; &amp; was afraid to leave off praying, lest I should again lose a Sense of the sweet Things of God.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Nov.</HI> 2. Was fill'd with Sorrow and Confusion, in the Morning, and could enjoy no sweet Sense of divine Things, nor get any Relief in Prayer. Saw I deserved, that every one of God's Creatures should be let loose upon me to be the Executio|ners of his Wrath against me: And yet therein I saw I deserved what I did not fear as my Portion. About Noon, rode up to the <HI>Indians</HI>; and while going, could feel no Desires for them, and even dreaded to say any Thing to 'em; but God was pleased to give me some Freedom and Enlargement, and made
<PB N="132" REF="006311_0165_0000000000000000">
the Season comfortable to me. In the Evening, had Enlargement in Prayer. But alas, what Comforts and Enlargements I have felt for these many Weeks past, have been only transient &amp; short; and the greater Part of my Time has been fill'd up with Dead|ness, or Struggles with Deadness, and bitter Conflicts with Cor|ruption. I have found my self exercised sorely with some parti|cular Things that I thought my self most of all freed from. And thus I have ever found it, when I have tho't the Battle was over, and the Conquest gained, and so let down my Watch, the Ene|my has risen up and done me the greatest Injury.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>Nov.</HI> 3. I read the Life and Trials of a godly Man, and was much warm'd by it: I wondered at my past Deadness; and was more convinced of it, than ever. Was enabled to confess and bewail my Sin before God, with Self-abhorrence.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Nov.</HI> 4. Had, I think, some Exercise of Faith in Prayer, in the Morning: Long'd to be Spiritual. Had con|siderable Help in preaching to my poor <HI>Indians:</HI> Was encouraged with them, and hoped that God designed Mercy for them.</P>
<P>[The next Day, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">On this Day he concluded his <HI>Narrative,</HI> that is at the End of his <HI>Ordination Sermon.</HI></NOTE> He set out on a Journey to <HI>New-York,</HI> to the Meeting of the <HI>Presbytery</HI> there; and was gone from Home more than a Fortnight. He seem'd to enter on this Journey with great Reluctance; fearing, that the Diversions of it would prove a Means of cooling his religious Affections, as he had found in other Journeys. But yet, in this Journey he had some special Seasons wherein he enjoyed extraordinary Evidences and Fruits of God's gracious Presence. He was greatly fatigued and exposed in this Journey by Cold and Storms: And when he returned from <HI>New-York</HI> to <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> on Friday, was taken very ill, and was detained by his Illness some Time.]</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Nov.</HI> 21. Rode from <HI>Newark</HI> to <HI>Rockciticus</HI> in the Cold, and was almost overcome with it. Enjoyed some Sweetness in Conversation with dear Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> while I dined with him: My Soul loves the People of God, and especially the Ministers of Jesus Christ, who feel the same Trials that I do.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Nov.</HI> 22. Came on my Way from <HI>Rockciticus</HI> to <HI>Delaware</HI> River. Was very much disordered with a Cold and Pain in my Head. About 6 at Night, I lost my Way in the
<PB N="133" REF="006311_0166_0000000000000000">
Wilderness, and wandered over Rocks and Mountains, down hideous Steeps, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Swamps, and most dreadful and dangerous Places: And the Night being dark, so that few Stars could be seen, I was greatly exposed: Was much pinch'd with Cold, and distress'd with an extream Pain in my Head, attended with Sickness at my Stomach; so that every Step I took was distres|sing to me. I had little Hope for several Hours together, but that I must lie out in the Woods all Night, in this distressed Case. But about 9 o'Clock, I found a House, thro' the abun|dant Goodness of God, and was kindly entertain'd. Thus I have frequently been exposed, &amp; sometimes lain out the whole Night: but God has hitherto preserved me; and blessed be his Name. Such Fatigues and Hardships as these serve to wean me more from the Earth; and, I trust, will make Heaven the sweeter. Formerly, when I was thus exposed to Cold, Rain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I was ready to please my self with the Thoughts of enjoying a com|fortable House, a warm Fire, and other outward Comforts; but now these have less Place in my Heart (thro' the Grace of God) and my Eye is more to God for Comfort. In this World I expect Tribulation; and it does not now, as formerly, appear strange to me; I don't in such Seasons of Difficulty flatter my self that it will be better hereafter; but rather think, how much worse it might be; how much greater Trials others of God's Children have endured; and how much greater are yet per|haps reserved for me. Blessed be God, that he makes the Thoughts of my Journey's End and of my Dissolution a great Comfort to me, under my sharpest Trials; &amp; scarce ever lets these Thoughts be attended with Terror or Melancholy; but they are attended frequently with great Joy.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Nov.</HI> 23. Visited a sick Man; discoursed and pray'd with him. Then visited another House, where was one dead and laid out; look'd on the Corps, and longed that my Time might come to <HI>depart,</HI> that I might be <HI>with Christ.</HI> Then went home to my Lodgings, about one o'Clock. Felt poorly; but was able to read, most of the Afternoon.</P>
<P>[Within the Space of the next twelve Days, he passed under many Changes in the Frames and Exercises of his Mind. He had many Seasons of the special Influences of God's Spirit, animat|ing, invigorating, and comforting him in the Ways of God and Duties of Religion; but had some Turns of great Dejection and Melancholy. He spent much Time, within this Space, in hard Labour, with others, to make for himself a little Cottage

or Hut, to live in by himself thro' the Winter. Yet he frequently preached to the <HI>Indians,</HI> &amp; speaks of special A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">tance he had from Time to Time, in addressing himself to them; And of his some|times having considerable Encouragement, from the Attention they gave. But on Tuesday <HI>Decemb.</HI> 4. he was sunk into great Discou|ragement, to see 'em (most of 'em) going in Company to an idolatrous <HI>Feast</HI> and <HI>Dance,</HI> after he had taken abundant Pain with them to disswade 'em from these Things.]</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 6. Having now a happy Opportunity of being retired in a House of my own, which I have lately procur|ed and moved into, and considering that it is now a long Time since I have been able, either on Account of bodily Weakness, or for want of Retirement, or some other Difficulty, to spend any Time in secret Fasting and Prayer; considering also the greatness of my Work, and the extream Difficulties that attend it: And that my poor <HI>Indians</HI> are now <HI>worshipping Devils,</HI> not|withstanding all the Pains I have taken with them, which almost overwhelms my Spirit: Moreover, considering my extreme Bar|renness, spiritual Deadness and Dejection, of late; as also the Power of some particular Corruptions; I sat apart this Day for secret Prayer and Fasting, to implore the Blessing of God on my self, on my poor People, on my Friends, and on the Church of God. At first, I felt a great Backwardness to the Duties of the Day, on Account of the seeming Impossibility of performing them: But the Lord helped me to break thro' this Difficulty. God was pleased, by the Use of Means, to give me some clear Conviction of my Sinfulness, and a Discovery of <HI>the Plague of my own Heart,</HI> more affecting than what I have of late had. And especially I saw my Sinfulness in this, that when God had <HI>withdrawn</HI> himself, then, instead of living and dying in <HI>Pursuit</HI> of him, I have been disposed to one of these two Things; ei|ther (first) to yield an unbecoming Respect to some <HI>earthly</HI> Ob|jects, as if Happiness were to be derived from them; or (2dly) to be secretly <HI>froward</HI> and impatient, and unsuitably desirous of <HI>Death,</HI> so that I have sometimes tho't I could not bear to think my Life must be lengthen'd out. And that which often drove me to this impatient Desire of Death, was a Despair of doing any Good in Life; and I chose Death, rather than a Life spent for Nothing. But now God made me sensible of my Sin in these Things, and enabled me to cry to him for <HI>Forgiveness.</HI> Yet this was not all I wanted; for my Soul appeared exceedingly polluted, my Heart seem'd like a Nest of Vipers, or a Cage of
<PB N="135" REF="006311_0168_0000000000000000">
unclean and hateful Birds: And therefore I wanted to be pu|rified <HI>by the Blood of Sprinkling,</HI> that <HI>cleanseth from all Sin.</HI> And this, I hope, I was enabled to pray for in Faith. I enjoyed much more Intenseness, Fervency, and Spirituality, than I expected; God was better to me than my Fears. And towards Night, I felt my Soul rejoyce, that God is unchangeably happy and glorious; that he will be glorified, whatever becomes of his Creatures. I was enabled to persevere in Prayer 'till some Time in the Evening: At which Time I saw so much Need of divine Help, in every Respect, that I knew not how to leave off, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> forgot that I needed Food. This Evening, I was much assisted in meditating on <HI>Isai.</HI> lii.3. Blessed be the Lord for any Help in the past Day.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 7. Spent some Time in Prayer, in the Morning; enjoyed some Freedom and Affection in the Duty, and had longing Desires of being made <HI>faithful to the Death.</HI> Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt a little Time in writing on a divine Subject: Then visited the <HI>Indians,</HI> and preach'd to 'em. But under inexpressi|ble Dejection: I had no Heart to speak to them, and could not do it, but as I forced my self: I knew, they must hate to hear me, as having but just got Home from their idolatrous Feast and Devil-Worship.&mdash;In the Evening, had some Free|dom in Prayer and Meditation.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>Decem.</HI> 8. Have been uncommonly free this Day from Dejection, and from that distressing Apprehension, that I could do nothing: Was enabled to pray and study with some Comfort; and especially was assisted in writing on a divine Subject. In the Evening, my Soul rejoyced in God; and I bless'd his Name for shining on my Soul. O the sweet and blessed Change I then felt, when God <HI>brought me out of Darkness into his marvellous Light!</HI></P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Decem.</HI> 9. Preach'd, both Parts of the Day, at a Place call'd <HI>Greenwich,</HI> in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> about 10 Miles from my own House. In the first Discourse I had scarce any Warmth or affectionate Longing for Souls. In the Intermission-Season I got alone among the Bushes, and cried to God for Pardon of my Deadness; and was in Anguish and Bitterness, that I could not address Souls with more Compassion and tender Affection: Judged and condemned my self for want of this divine Temper: Tho' I saw I could not get it as of my self, any more than I could make a World. In the latter Exercise, blessed be the Lord, I had some Fervency, both in Prayer and Preaching; and especially in the Application of my Discourse was enabled to
<PB N="136" REF="006311_0169_0000000000000000">
address precious Souls with Affection, Concern, Tenderness and Importunity. The Spirit of God, I think, was there; as the Effects were apparent, Tears running down many Cheeks.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Decem.</HI> 10. Near Noon, I preach'd again: God gave me some Assistance, and enabled me to be in some Degree faithful; so that I had Peace in my own Soul, and a very com|fortable Composure, <HI>altho'</HI> Israel <HI>should not be gathered.</HI> Came away from <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and rode Home; arrived just in the Evening. By the Way, my Soul bless'd God for his Goodness; and I rejoyced, that so much of my Work was done, and I so much nearer my blessed Reward. Blessed be God for Grace to be faithful.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>Decem.</HI> 11. Felt very poorly in Body, being much tired and worn out the last Night. Was assisted in some Mea|sure in writing on a divine Subject: But was so feeble and sore in my Breast, that I had not much Resolution in my Work. Oh, how I long for that World <HI>where the weary are at Rest!</HI> And yet thro' the Goodness of God I don't now feel impatient.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Decem.</HI> 12. Was again very weak; but some|what assisted in secret Prayer, and enabled with Pleasure and Sweetness to cry, <HI>Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus; come quickly.</HI> My Soul <HI>longed for God,</HI> for <HI>the living God.</HI> O how delightful it is, to pray under such sweet Influences! Oh how much better is this, than one's <HI>necessary Food!</HI> I had at this Time no Disposition to eat (tho' late in the Morning;) for earthly Food appear'd wholly Tastless. O how much <HI>better is thy Love than Wine,</HI> than the sweetest Wine!&mdash; I visited and preached to the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the Afternoon; but under much Dejection. Found my <HI>Interpreter</HI> under some Concern for his Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; which was some Comfort to me; and yet fill'd me with new Care. I longed greatly for his Conversion; lifted up my Heart to God for it, while I was talking to him: Came Home, and poured out my Soul to God for him: Enjoyed some Freedom in Prayer, and was enabled, I think, to leave all with God.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Decem.</HI> 13. Endeavoured to spend the Day in Fasting and Prayer, to implore the divine Blessing, more especi|ally on my poor People; and in particular, I sought for con|verting Grace for my <HI>Interpreter,</HI> and three or four more under some Concern for their Souls. I was much disordered in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> when I arose; but having determined to spend the Day in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Manner, I attempted it. Some Freedom I had in pleading for these poor concerned Souls, several Times; and when in|terceeding for them, I enjoyed greater Freedom from wandring
<PB N="137" REF="006311_0170_0000000000000000">
and distracting Thoughts, than in any Part of my Supplications: But, in the general, was greatly exercised with Wandrings; so that in the Evening it seemed as if I had need to pray for no|thing so much as for the Pardon of Sins committed in the Day past, and the Vileness I then found in my self. The Sins I had most Sense of, were Pride, and wandring Thoughts, whereby I mocked God. The former of these cursed Iniquities excited me to think of writing, or preaching, or converting Heathen, or performing some other great Work, that my Name might live when I should be dead. My Soul was in Anguish, and ready to drop into Despair, to find so much of that cursed Temper. With this, and the other Evil I laboured under, <HI>viz.</HI> wandring Thoughts, I was almost overwhelmed, and even ready to give over striving after a Spirit of Devotion; and oftentimes sunk into a considera|ble Degree of Despondency, and thought I was <HI>more brutish than any Man.</HI> Yet after all my Sorrows, I trust thro' Grace, this Day and the Exercises of it have been for my Good, and taught me more of my Corruption, and Weakness without Christ, than I knew before.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Decem.</HI> 14. Near Noon, went to the <HI>Indians</HI>; but knew not what to say to them, and was ashamed to look them in the Face: I felt I had no Power to address their Consciences, and therefore had no Boldness to say any Thing. Was, much of the Day, in a great Degree of Despair about ever <HI>doing</HI> or <HI>seeing any Good in the Land of the Living.</HI></P>
<P>[He continued under the same Dejection the next Day.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Decem.</HI> 16. Was so overwhelmed with De|jection, that I knew not how to live: I long'd for Death exceed|ingly: My Soul was <HI>sunk into deep Waters,</HI> and <HI>the Floods</HI> were ready to <HI>drown me</HI>: I was so much oppress'd, that my Soul was in a kind of Horrour: I could not keep my Thoughts fixed in Prayer, for the Space of one Minute, without Fluttering and Di|straction: I was exceedingly ashamed, that I did not live to God: I had no distressing Doubt about my own State; but would have cheerfully ventured (as far as I could possibly know) into Eternity. While I was going to preach to the <HI>Indians,</HI> my Soul was in Anguish; I was so overborn with Discouragement; that I despair'd of doing any Good, and was driven to my Wits End; I knew nothing what to say, nor what Course to take. But at last I insisted on the Evidence we have of the Truth of Christianity from the <HI>Miracles</HI> of Christ; many of which I set
<PB N="138" REF="006311_0171_0000000000000000">
before them: And God helped me to make a close Application to those that refused to believe the Truth of what I taught them: And indeed I was enabled to speak to the Consciences of all, in some Measure. I was something encouraged, to find, that God enabled me to be faithful once more. Then came and preached to another Company of them; but was very weary and faint. In the Evening, I was something refresh'd, and was enabled to pray and praise God with Composure and Affection: Had some Enlargement and Courage with Respect to my Work: Was willing to live, and longed to do more for God, than my weak state of Body would admit of. <HI>I can do all Things through Christ that strengthens me</HI>; and by his Grace, I am willing to <HI>spend</HI> and <HI>be spent</HI> in his Service, when I am not thus sunk in Dejection and a kind of Despair.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Decem.</HI> 17. Was something comfortable in Mind, most of the Day; and was enabled to pray with some Freedom, Cheerfulness, Composure, and Devotion; had also some As|sistance in writing on a divine Subject.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 18. Went to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and discoursed to them, near an Hour, without any Power to come close to their Hearts. But at last, I felt some Fervency, and God help'd me to speak with Warmth. My <HI>Interpreter</HI> also was amazingly assisted; and I doubt not but <HI>the Spirit of God was upon him</HI> (tho' I had no Reason to think he had any true and saving Grace, but was only under Conviction of his lost State;) and presently upon this most of the grown Persons were much affected, and the Tears ran down their Cheeks; and one <HI>old Man</HI> (I suppose, an hundred Years old) was so affected, that he wept, and seem'd convinced of the Importance of what I taught them. I staid with them a considerable Time, exhorting and directing them; and came away, lifting up my Heart to God in Prayer and Praise, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd encouraged and exhorted my <HI>Interpreter</HI> to <HI>strive to enter in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the strait Gale.</HI> Came home, and spent most of the Evening <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Prayer and Thanksgiving; and found my self much enlarged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd quicken'd. Was greatly concerned, that the Lord's Work which seem'd to be begun, might be carried on with Power, to the Conversion of poor Souls, and the Glory of divine Grace.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 19. Spent a great Part of the Day in Pray|er to God for the <HI>Out-pouring of his Spirit</HI> on my poor People; as also to bless his Name for awakning my <HI>Interpreter,</HI> and some others, and giving us some Tokens of his Presence Yesterday. And blessed be God, I had much Freedom, five or six Times in the Day, in Prayer and Praise, and felt a weighty Concern
<PB N="139" REF="006311_0172_0000000000000000">
upon my Spirit for the Salvation of those precious Souls, and the Enlargement of the Redeemer's Kingdom among them. My Soul hoped in God for some Success in my Ministry: And blessed be his Name for so much Hope.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 20. Was enabled to visit the Throne of Grace frequently, this Day; and thro' divine Goodness enjoy|ed much Freedom and Fervency, sundry Times: Was much assisted in crying for Mercy for my poor People, and felt Chear|fulness and Hope in my Requests for them. I spent much of the Day in Writing; but was enabled to intermix Prayer with my Studies.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 21. Was enabled again to pray with Freedom, Chearfulness, and Hope. God was pleased to make the Duty comfortable and pleasant to me; so that I delighted to perse|vere, and repeatedly to engage in it. Towards Noon, visited my People, and spent the whole Time in the Way to them in Prayer, longing to <HI>see the Power of God</HI> among them, as there appear'd something of it the last Tuesday; and I found it sweet to rest and hope in God. Preach'd to them twice, and at two distinct Places: Had considerable Freedom, each Time, and so had my <HI>Interpreter.</HI> Several of 'em followed me from one Place to the other: And I thought, there was some divine In|fluence discernable amongst them. In the Evening, was assisted in Prayer again. Blessed, blessed be the Lord.</P>
<P>[Very much the same Things are expressed concerning his inward Frame, Exercises, and Assistances on Saturday, as on the preceeding Days. He observes, that this was a comfortable Week to him. But then concludes, <HI>Oh! That I had no Reason to complain of much Barrenness. Oh that there were no vain Tho'ts and evil Affections lodging within me. The Lord knows how I long for that World, where they rest not Day nor Night, saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord God Almighty,</HI> &amp;c. On the following Sabbath, he speaks of Assistance and Freedom in his publick Work, but as having less of the sensible Presence of God, than frequently in the Week past: But yet says, his Soul was kept from sinking in Discouragement. On Monday, again he seem'd to enjoy very much the same Liberty and Fervency, thro' the Day, that he enjoyed thro' the greater Part of the preceeding Week. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Day he wrote the fifth <HI>Letter</HI> added at the End of this History.</NOTE>]</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="006311_0173_0000000000000000">Tuesday, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 25. Enjoy'd very little quiet Sleep last Night, by Reason of bodily Weakness, and the closeness of my Studies Yesterday: Yet my Heart was somewhat lively in Prayer &amp; Praise: I was delighted with the divine Glory and Happiness, and re|joyced that God was God, &amp; that he was unchangeably possess'd of Glory and Blessedness. Tho' God <HI>hold my Eyes waking,</HI> yet he helped me to improve my Time profitably amidst my Pain and Weakness, in continued Meditations on <HI>Luke</HI> xiii.7. <HI>Behold these three Years I come se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing Fruit,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>[He continued in a very low State, as to his bodily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, for some Days: Which seems to have been a great Hindrance to him in his religious Exercises and Pursuits. But yet he ex|presses some Degree of divine Assistance, from Day to Day, thro' the remaining Part of this Week. He preach'd several Times this Week to his <HI>Indians</HI>; and there appeared still <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Concern amongst them for their Souls. On Saturday, he rode to the <HI>Irish</HI> Settlement, about 15 Miles from his Lodgings, in order to spend the Sabbath there.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 30. Discoursed, both Parts of the Day, from <HI>Mark</HI> viii.34. <HI>Whosoever will come after me,</HI> &amp;c. God gave me very great Freedom and Clearness, and (in the Afternoon especially) considerable Warmth and Fervency. In the Even|ing also, had very great Clearness while conversing with Friends on divine Things: I don't remember ever to have had more clear Apprehensions of Religion in my Life: But found a Strug|gle, in the Evening, with spiritual Pride.</P>
<P>[On Monday, he preach'd again in the same Place with Freedom and Fervency; and rode home to his Lodging; and arrived in the Evening, under a considerable Degree of bodily Illness, which continued the two next Days. And he complains much of spiritual Emptiness and Barrenness on those Days.]</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>January</HI> 3.1744, 5. Being sensible of the great want of divine Influences, and the out-pouring of God's Spirit, I spent this Day in Fasting and Prayer, to seek so great a Mercy for my self, and my poor People in particular, and for the Church of God in general. In the Morning, was very Lifeless in Prayer, and could get scarce any Sense of God. Near Noon, enjoyed some sweet Freedom to pray that the <HI>Will of God</HI> might in ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

Respect become <HI>mine</HI>: And I am perswaded, it was so at that Time in some good Degree. In the Afternoon, I was exceeding work, and could not enjoy much Fervency in Prayer; but felt a great Degree of Dejection; which, I believe, was very much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wing to my bodily Weakness and Disorder.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Jan.</HI> 4. Rode up to the <HI>Indians,</HI> near Noon; spent some Time there under great Disorder: My Soul was <HI>sunk down into deep Waters,</HI> and I was almost overwhelmed with Melancholy.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>Jan.</HI> 5. Was able to do something at Writing; but was much disordered with Pain in my Head. At Night, was distress'd with a Sense of my spiritual Pollution, and ten Thou|sand youthful, yea, and childish Follies, that no Body but my self had any Thought about; all which appeared to me now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and in a lively View, as if committed Yesterday, and made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Soul ashamed before God, and caused me to hate my self.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Jan.</HI> 6. Was still distress'd with vapoury Dis|orders. Preached to my poor <HI>Indians</HI>; but had little Heart or Life. Towards Night, my Soul was press'd under a Sense of my Unfaithfulness. O the Joy &amp; Peace that arises from a Sense of <HI>having obtain'd Mercy of God to be faithful!</HI> And Oh, the Misery and Anguish that spring from an Apprehension of the contrary!</P>
<P>[His Dejection continued the two next Days; but not to so great a Degree on Tuesday, when he enjoyed some Freedom and Fervency in preaching to the <HI>Indians.</HI>]</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Jan.</HI> 9. In the Morning, God was pleas'd to remove that Gloom which has of late oppress'd my Mind, and gave me Freedom and Sweetness in Prayer. I was encouraged and strengthe'd, and enabled to plead for Grace for my sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Mercy for my poor <HI>Indians</HI>; and was sweetly assisted in my Intercessions with God for others. Blessed be his holy Name forever and ever; Amen, and Amen. Those Things that of late have appear'd most difficult and almost impossible, now ap|peared not only possible, but easy. My Soul so much delighted to continue instant in Prayer, at this blessed Season, that I had no Desire for my <HI>necessary Food:</HI> even dreaded leaving off praying at all, lest I should lose this Spirituality, and this blessed Thankful|ness to God which I then felt. I felt now quite willing to live, and undergo all Trials that might remain for me in a World <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f Sorrow; but still longed for Heaven, that I might glorify God in a perfect Manner. O <HI>come, Lord Jesus, come quickly.</HI> Spent the Day in Reading a little; and in some Diversions, which I was necessitated to take by Reason of much Weakness and Disorder. In the Evening, enjoyed some Freedom and Intense|ness in Prayer.</P>

On the Sabbath, this Sweetness and spiritual Alacrity began to abate: But still he enjoyed some Degree of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and had Assistance in preaching to the <HI>Indians.</HI>]</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Jan.</HI> 14. Spent this Day under a great Degree of bodily Weakness and Disorder; and had very little Freedom, either in my Studies or Devotions: And in the Evening, I was much dejected and melancholy. It pains and distresses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that I live so much of my Time for nothing. I long to do much in a little Time, and if it might be the Lord's will, to <HI>finish my Work</HI> speedily in this tiresom World. I'm sure, I don't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to live for any Thing in this World; and thro' Grace I am not afraid to look the <HI>King of Terrors</HI> in the Face: I know, I shall be afraid, if God leaves me; and therefore I think it always Duty to lay in for that solemn Hour. But for a very considera|ble Time past, my Soul has rejoyced to think of Death in its nearest Approaches; and even when I have been very weak, and seem'd nearest Eternity. <HI>Not unto me, not unto me, but to God be the Glory.</HI> I feel that which convinces me, that if God don't enable me to maintain a holy Dependance upon him, Death will easily be a Terrour to me; but at present, I must say, <HI>I long to depart and to be with Christ,</HI> which is best of all. When I am in a sweet resigned Frame of Soul, I am willing to tarry a while in a World of Sorrow, I am willing to be from Home as long as God sees fit it should be so: But when I want the Influence of this Temper, I am then apt to be impatient to be gone.&mdash;Oh when will the Day appear, that I shall be perfect in Holiness, and in the Enjoyment of God!</P>
<P>[The next Day was spent under a great Degree of Dejection and Melancholy; which (as he himself says, he was perswaded) was owing partly to bodily Weakness, and vapoury Disorders.]</P>
<P>Wednesday, &amp; Thursday, <HI>Jan.</HI> 16 &amp; 17. I spent most of the Time in writing on a sweet divine Subject, and enjoyed some Freedom and Assistance. Was likewise enabled to pray more frequently and fervently than usual: and my Soul, I think, rejoyced in God; especially on the Evening of the last of these Days: <HI>Praise</HI> then seem'd <HI>comely,</HI> and I delighted to bless the Lord. O what Reason have I to be thankful, that God ever
<PB N="143" REF="006311_0176_0000000000000000">
helps me to Labour and Study for him! He does but <HI>receive his own,</HI> when I am enabled in any Measure to praise him, labour for him, and live to him. Oh, how comfortable and sweet it is, to feel the Assistance of divine Grace in the Performance of the Duties God has enjoined us! <HI>Bless the Lord, O my Soul.</HI></P>
<P>[The same Enlargement of Heart and joyful Frame of Soul continued thro' the next Day. But on the Day following it began to decline; which Decay seems to have continued the whole of the next Week: Yet he enjoyed some Seasons of special and sweet Assistance.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Jan.</HI> 27. Had the greatest Degree of inward Anguish, that almost ever I endured: I was perfectly over|whelmed, and so confused, that after I began to discourse to the <HI>Indians,</HI> before I could finish a Sentence, sometimes I forgot en|ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ely what I was aiming at; or if, with much difficulty, I had recollected what I had before designed, still it appeared strange, and like something I had long forgotten, and had now but an imperfect Remembrance of. I know, it was a Degree of Distraction, occasion'd by vapoury Disorders, Melancholy, spiritual Desertion, and some other Things that particularly press'd upon me, this Morning, with an uncommon Weight, the principal of which respected my <HI>Indians.</HI> This distressing Gloom never went off the whole Day; but was so far removed, that I was enabled to speak with some Freedom and Concern to the <HI>Indians,</HI> at two of their Settlements; and I think, there was some Appearance of the Presence of God with us, some Seriousness, and seeming Concern among the <HI>Indians,</HI> at least a few of them. In the Evening, this Gloom continued still, 'till Family-Prayer, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho' Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> now dwelt by himself in the foremen|tion'd little Cottage, which he had built for his own Use, yet that was near to a <HI>Family</HI> of white People with whom he had lived before, and with whom he still attended Family-Prayer.</NOTE> about nine o'Clock, and almost thro' this, until I came near the Close, when I was praying (as I usually do) for the Illumination and Conversion of my poor People; and then the Cloud was scatter'd, so that I enjoy'd Sweetness and Freedom, and conceived Hopes, that God designed Mercy for some of them. The same I enjoyed afterwards in secret Prayer;
<PB N="144" REF="006311_0177_0000000000000000">
in which precious Duty I had for a considerable Time Sweet|ness and Freedom, and (I hope) Faith, in praying for my self, my poor <HI>Indians,</HI> and dear Friends and Acquaintance in <HI>New-England</HI> and elsewhere, and for the dear Interest of <HI>Zion</HI> in general. <HI>Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all his Benefits.</HI></P>
<P>[He spent the rest of this Week, or at least the most of it, under Dejection and Melancholy: Which on Friday rose to an extream Height; he being then, as he himself observes, much exercised with vapoury Disorders. This exceeding Gloominess continued on Saturday, 'till the Evening, when he was again re|lieved in Family-Prayer; and after it, was refresh'd in secret, and felt willing to live, and endure Hardships in the Cause of God; and found his Hopes of the Advancement of Christ's Kingdom, as also his Hopes to <HI>see the Power of God</HI> among the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> considerably raised.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Feb.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. In the Morning, I was somewhat re|lieved of that Gloom and Confusion, that my Mind has of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> been greatly exercised with: Was enabled to pray with some Composure, and Comfort. But however, went to my <HI>Indians</HI> trembling; for my Soul <HI>remembred the Wormwood and the God</HI> (I might almost say the <HI>Hell</HI>) of Friday last; and I was greatly afraid I should be obliged again to drink of that <HI>Cup of Trembling,</HI> which was inconceivably more bitter than Death, and made me long for the Grave more, unspeakably more, than for hid Trea|sures, yea, inconceivably more than the Men of this World long for such Treasures. But God was pleased to hear my Cries, and to afford me great Assistance; so that I felt Peace in my own Soul; and was satisfied that if not one of the <HI>Indians</HI> should be profited by my Preaching, but should all be damned, yet I should be accepted and rewarded as faithful; for I am perswaded, God enabled me to be so.&mdash; Had some good Degree of Help after|wards, at another Place; and much longed for the Conversion of the poor <HI>Indians.</HI> Was somewhat refreshed, and comfortable, towards Night, and in the Evening. O that my Soul might praise the Lord for his Goodness.&mdash; Enjoyed some Freedom, in the Evening, in Meditation on <HI>Luke</HI> xiii.24.</P>
<P>[In the three next Days, he was the Subject of much De|jection: But the three remaining Days of the Week seem to have been spent with much Composure and Comfort. On the next Sabbath, he preach'd at <HI>Greenwich</HI> in <HI>New-Jersey.</HI> In the Evening, he rode eight Miles to visit a sick Man at the Point of Death, and sound him Speechless and Senseless.]</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="006311_0178_0000000000000000">Monday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 11. About Break-of-Day, the sick Man died. I was affected at the Sight: Spent the Morning with the Mourners; and after Prayer, and some Discourse with them, I returned to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and preached again from <HI>Psal.</HI> lxxxix 15. And the Lord gave me Assistance: I felt a sweet Love to Souls, and to the Kingdom of Christ; and longed that poor Sinners might <HI>know the joyful Sound.</HI> Several Persons were much affected. And after Meeting, I was enabled to discourse, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Freedom and Concern, to some Persons that applied to me under spiritual Trouble. Left the Place, sweetly composed, and rode home to my House about 8 Miles distant. Discoursed to Friends, and inculcated divine Truths upon some. In the Evening, was in the most solemn Frame that almost ever I remember to have experienced: I know not that ever Death appeared more real to me, or that ever I saw my self in the Condition of a dead Corpse, laid out, and dress'd for a Lodging in the silent Grave, so evidently as at this Time. And yet I felt exceeding comfortably: My Mind was composed and calm, and <HI>Death</HI> appeared <HI>with|out a Sting.</HI> I think, I never felt such an universal Mortifica|tion to all created Objects as now. Oh, how great and solemn a Thing it appeared to die! Oh, how it lays the greatest Honour in the Dust! And Oh, how vain and trifling did the Riches, Honours, and Pleasures of the World appear! I could not, I dare not, so much as think of any of them: for <HI>Death, Death,</HI> solemn (tho' not frightful) <HI>Death</HI> appeared at the Door. Oh, I could see my self dead, and laid out, and inclosed in my Coffin, and put down into the cold Grave, with greatest Solemnity, but without Terror! I spent most of the Evening, in conversing with a dear Christian Friend: And, blessed be God, it was a com|fortable Evening to us both.&mdash; What are Friends? What are Comforts? What are Sorrows? What are Distresses?&mdash; <HI>The Time is short: It remains, that they which weep, be as tho' they wept not; and they which rejoyce, as tho' they rejoyced not: for the Fashion of this World passeth away. O come, Lord Jesus, come quickly</HI>; Amen.&mdash; Blessed be God for the Comforts of the past Day.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 12. Was exceeding weak; but in a sweet resigned, composed Frame, most of the Day: Felt my Heart freely go forth after God in Prayer.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 13. Was much exercised with vapoury Disorders; but still enabled to maintain Solemnity, and I think, Spirituality.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="006311_0179_0000000000000000">Thursday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 14. Spent the Day in writing on a divine Subject: Enjoy'd Health, and Freedom in my Work: Had a solemn Sense of Death; as I have indeed had every Day this Week, in some Measure: What I felt on Monday last, has been abiding, in some considerable Degree, ever since.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 15. Was engaged in writing again almost the whole Day. In the Evening, was much assisted in meditating on that precious Text, <HI>John</HI> vii.37. <HI>Jesus stood and cried</HI> &amp;c. I had then a sweet Sense of the free Grace of the Gospel: My Soul was encouraged, warm'd and quicken'd, and my Desires drawn out after God in Prayer: My Soul was watchful, and afraid of losing so sweet a Guest as I then entertain'd. I conti|nued long in Prayer and Meditation, intermixing one with the other; and was unwilling to be diverted by any Thing at all from so sweet an Exercise. I longed to proclaim the Grace I then meditated upon, to the World of Sinners.&mdash; O how <HI>quick</HI> and <HI>powerful</HI> is the <HI>Word</HI> of the blessed God!</P>
<P>[The next Day, he complains of great Conflicts with Cor|ruption, and much Discomposure of Mind.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Feb.</HI> 17. Preach'd to the <HI>white</HI> People (my <HI>Interpreter</HI> being absent) in the Wilderness upon the sunny side of a Hill: Had a cosinderable Assembly, consisting of People that lived (at least many of them) not less than 30 Miles asun|der; some of them came near 20 Miles. I discoursed to 'em, all Day, from <HI>John</HI> vii.37. <HI>Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any Man thirst,</HI> &amp;c. In the Afternoon, it pleased God to grant me great Freedom and Fervency in my Discourse; and I was ena|bled to imitate the Example of Christ in the Text, who <HI>stood and cried.</HI>&mdash; I think, I was scarce ever enabled to offer the free Grace of God to perishing Sinners with more Freedom and Plainness in my Life. And afterwards, I was enabled earnestly to invite the Children of God to come renewedly, and drink of this Fountain of Water of Life, from whence they have here|tofore derived unspeakable Satisfaction. It was a very comfor|table Time to me: There were many Tears in the Assembly; and I doubt not but that the Spirit of God was there, convincing poor Sinners of their need of Christ.&mdash; In the Evening, I felt composed, and comfortable, tho' much tired: I had some sweet Sense of the Excellency and Glory of God; and my Soul re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ced, that he was <HI>God over all, blessed forever</HI>; but was too much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with Company and Conversation, and longed

to be more alone with God. Oh that I could forever bless God for the Mercy of this Day, who <HI>answered me in the Joy of my Heart.</HI></P>
<P>[The rest of this Week seems to have been spent under a Decay of this Life and Joy, and in distressing Conflicts with Corruption; but not without some Seasons of Refreshment and Comfort.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Feb.</HI> 24. In the Morning, was much perplex'd: My <HI>Interpreter</HI> being absent, I knew not how to perform my Work among the <HI>Indians.</HI> However, I rode to the <HI>Indians,</HI> got a <HI>Dutch-Man</HI> to Interpret for me, tho' he was but poorly qua|lified for the Business. Afterwards, I came and preach'd to a few white People from <HI>John</HI> vi.67. Here the Lord seemed to unburden me in some Measure; especially towards the close of my Discourse: I felt Freedom to open the <HI>Love of Christ</HI> to his own dear <HI>Disciples</HI>: When the rest of the World <HI>forsakes</HI> him, and are <HI>forsaken</HI> by him, that he calls them no more, he then turns to his own, and says, <HI>Will ye also go away!</HI> I had a Sense of the free Grace of Christ to his own People, in such Seasons of general Apostacy, and when they themselves in some Mea|sure backslide with the World. O the free Grace of Christ, that he seasonably minds his People of their Danger of <HI>Back|sliding,</HI> and invites them to persevere in their Adherence to him|self! I saw that <HI>backsliding</HI> Souls, who seem'd to be about to <HI>go away</HI> with the World, might return, and welcome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o him <HI>im|mediately</HI>; without any Thing to recommend th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> notwith|standing all their former Backslidings. And thus my Discourse was suited to my own Soul's Case: For, of late, I have found a great want of this Sense and Apprehension of divine Grace; and have often been greatly distress'd in my own Soul, because I did not suitably apprehend this <HI>Fountain open'd to purge away Sin</HI>; and so have been too much labouring for spiritual Life, Peace of Con|science, and progressive Holiness, in my own Strength: But now God shewed me, in some Measure, <HI>the Arm</HI> of all Strength, and <HI>the Fountain</HI> of all Grace.&mdash; In the Evening, I felt solemn, devout, and sweet, resting on free Grace for Assistance, Accep|tance, and Peace of Conscience.</P>
<P>[Within the Space of the next nine Days, he had frequent refreshing, invigorating Influences of God's Spirit; attended with Complaint of Dulness, and with Longings after spiritual Life and holy Fervency.]</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="006311_0181_0000000000000000">Wednesday, <HI>March</HI> 6. Spent most of the Day in preparing for a Journey to <HI>New-England.</HI> Spent some Time in Prayer, with a special Reference to my intended Journey. Was afraid I should forsake the <HI>Fountain of living Waters,</HI> &amp; attempt to derive Satisfaction from <HI>broken Cisterns,</HI> my dear Friends &amp; Acquaintance, with whom I might meet in my Journey. I look'd to God to keep me from this <HI>Vanity</HI> in special, as well as others. Towards Night, and in the Evening, was visited by some Friends, some of whom, I trust, were real Christians; who discovered an af|fectiona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Regard to me, and seem'd grieved that I was about to leave them; especially seeing I did not expect to make any considerable Stay among them, if I should live to return from <HI>New-England.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It seems, he had a Design, by what afterwards appears, to remove and live among <HI>the Indians</HI> at <HI>Susquahannah</HI>-River.</NOTE> O how kind has God been to me!

Appearances of a good Effect on the Auditory. He also had many Seasons of special Comfort and spiritual Refreshment, in Conversation with Ministers and other Christian Friends, and also in Meditation and Prayer by himself alone.]</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>April</HI> 13. Rode Home to my own House at the Forks of <HI>Delaware</HI>: Was enabled to remember the Goodness of the Lord, who has now preserved me while riding full 600 Miles in this Journey; has kept me that none of my Bones have been broken. Blessed be the Lord, who has preserved me in this tedious Journey, and returned me in Safety to my own House. Verily 'tis God that has upheld me, and guarded my Goings.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>April</HI> 14.

It was, as I then hoped and was afterwards abundantly satisfied by conversing with them, a <HI>Word spoken i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Season to</HI> many <HI>weary Souls.</HI> I was extremely tired, and my Spi|rits much exhausted, so that I could scarcely speak loud; yet I could not help rejoicing in God.</P>
<P>Lords-Day, <HI>April</HI> 21. In the Morning, was calm and com|posed, and had some out-goings of Soul after God in secret Duties, and longing Desires of his Presence in the <HI>Sanctuary</HI> and at his <HI>Table</HI>; that his Presence might be in the Assembly; and that his Children might be entertain'd with a <HI>Feast of fat Things.</HI>&mdash; In the Forenoon, Mr. <HI>Treat</HI> preach'd. I felt some Affection and Tenderness in the Season of the Administration of the Ordinance. Mr. <HI>Beaty</HI> preached to the Multitude abroad, who could not half have crouded into the Meeting-House. In the Season of the Communion, I had comfortable and sweet Apprehensions of the blissful Communion of God's People, when they shall meet at their Father's Table in his Kingdom, in a State of Perfection.&mdash; In the Afternoon, I preach'd abroad to the whole Assembly, from <HI>Rev.</HI> xiv.4. <HI>These are they that follow the Lamb,</HI> &amp;c. God was pleased again to give me very great Freedom and Clearness, but not so much Warmth as before. However, there was a most a|mazing Attention in the whole Assembly; and, as I was in|formed afterwards, this was a sweet Season to many.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Apr.</HI> 22. I enjoy'd some Sweetness in Retirement, in the Morning. At eleven o'Clock, Mr. <HI>Beaty</HI> preach'd, with Freedom and Life. Then I preach'd from <HI>Joh.</HI> vii.37. and concluded the Solemnity. Had some Freedom; but not equal to what I had enjoyed before: Yet in the Prayer, the Lord ena|bled me to cry (I hope) with a Child-like Temper, with Ten|derness and Brokenness of Heart.&mdash; Came Home with Mr. <HI>Beaty</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Lodgings; and spent the Time, while riding, and after|wards, very agreably on divine Things.</P>

<P>[The two next Days, he speaks of much bodily Disorder, but of some Degrees of spiritual Assistance and Freedom.]</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>April</HI> 26. Conversed with a Christian Friend with some Warmth; and felt a Spirit of Mortification to the World, in a very great Degree. Afterwards, was enabled to pray fer|vently,

and to rely on God sweetly, for <HI>all Things pertaining to Life and Godliness.</HI> Just in the Evening, was visited by a dear Christian Friend, with whom I spent an Hour or two in Con|versation, on the very Soul of Religion. There are many with whom I can talk <HI>about Religion</HI>: But alas, I find few with whom I can talk <HI>Religion it self</HI>: But, blessed be the Lord, there are some that love to feed on the Kernel, rather than the Shell.</P>
<P>[The next Day, he went to the <HI>Irish</HI> Settlement, often be|fore mentioned, about 15 Miles distant; where he spent the Sabbath, and preached with some considerable Assistance. On Monday, he returned, in a very weak State, to his own Lodgings.]</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>April</HI> 30. Was scarce able to walk about, and was obliged to betake my self to the Bed, much of the Day; and spent away the Time in a very solitary Manner; being neither able to read, meditate, nor pray, and had none to converse with in that Wilderness. Oh, how heavily does Time pass away, when I can do nothing to any good Purpose; but seem obliged to trifle away precious Time! But of late, I have seen it my Duty to <HI>divert</HI> my self by all lawful Means, that I may be fit, at least some small Part of my Time, to labour for God. And here is the Difference between my present Diversions, and those I once pursued, when in a natural State. Then I made a god of Diversions, delighted in them with a Neglect of GOD, and drew my highest Satisfaction from them: Now I use them as <HI>Means</HI> to help me in <HI>living to God</HI>; fixedly delighting in <HI>Him,</HI> and not in them, drawing my highest Satisfaction from <HI>Him.</HI> Then they were my <HI>All</HI>; now they are only Means leading to my <HI>All.</HI> And those Things that are the greatest Di|version, when pursued with this View, don't tend to hinder, but promote my Spirituality; and I see now, more than ever, that they are absolutely necessary.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>May</HI> 1. Was not able to sit up more than half the Day; and yet had such Recruits of Strength sometimes, that I was able to write a little on a divine Subject. Was grieved that I could no more live to God. In the Evening, had some Sweetness and Intenseness in secret Prayer.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>May</HI> 2. In the Evening, being a little better in Health, I walk'd into the Woods, and enjoyed a sweet Season of Meditation and Prayer. My Thoughts run upon <HI>Psal.</HI> xvii.15. <HI>I shall be satisfied, when I awake with thy Likeness.</HI> And it was indeed a precious Text to me. I long'd to preach to the whole

World: And it seem'd to me, they must needs all be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in hearing such precious divine Truths, as I had then a View and Relish of. My Thoughts were exceeding clear, and my Soul was refreshed. &mdash;Blessed be the Lord, that in my late &amp; present Weakness, now for many Days together, my Mind is not gloo|my, as at some other Times.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>May</HI> 3. Felt a little Vigour of Body and Mind, in the Morning&punc; Had some Freedom, Strength, and Sweetness in Prayer. Rode to and spent some Time with my <HI>Indians.</HI> In the Evening, again retiring into the Woods, I enjoyed some sweet Meditations on <HI>Isaiah</HI> liii.1. <HI>Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>[The three next Days were spent in much weakness of Body: But yet he enjoyed some Assistance in publick and private Duties: and seems to have remain'd free from Melancholy.]</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>May</HI> 7. Spent the Day mainly in making Prepa|ration for a Journey into the Wilderness. Was still weak, and concerned how I should perform so difficult a Journey. Spent some Time in Prayer for the divine Blessing, Direction and Protection in my intended Journey; but wanted bodily Strength to spend the Day in Fasting and Prayer.</P>
<P>[The next Day, he set out on his Journey to <HI>Susquahannah,</HI> with his Interpreter. He endured great Hardships &amp; Fatigues in his Way thither thro' a hideous Wilderness; where, after having lodg'd one Night in the open Woods, he was overtaken with a North-Easterly Storm, in which he was almost ready to perish. Having no Manner of Shelter, and not being able to make a Fire in so great a Rain, he could have no Comfort if he stopt; therefore determin'd to go forward, in Hopes of meeting with some Shelter, without which he tho't it impossible he should live the Night thro': But their Horses hap'ning to have eat Poison (for want of other Food) at a Place where they lodged the Night before, were so sick that they could neither ride nor lead 'em, but were obliged to drive 'em before them, and travel on Foot; until thro' the Mercy of God (just at Dusk) they came to a Bark-Hutt, where they lodged that Night. After he came to <HI>Susquahannah,</HI> he travelled about the Length of an 100 Miles on the River, &amp; visited many Towns &amp; Settlements of the <HI>Indians</HI>; saw some of 7 or 8 distinct Tribes; and preached to different Nations, by different Interpreters. He was sometimes much discouraged, and sunk in his Spirits, thro' the Opposition that appeared in the <HI>Indians</HI>

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Christianity. At other Times, he was encouraged by the Disposition that some of these People manifested to hear, and Willingness to be instructed. He here met with some that had formerly been his Hearers at <HI>Kaun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umeek,</HI> and had removed hi|ther; who saw and heard him again with great Joy. He spent a Fortnight among the <HI>Indians</HI> on this River; and pass'd thro' considerable Labours and Hardships, frequently lodging on the Ground, and sometimes in the open Air; And at length he fell extremely Ill, as he was Riding in the Wilderness, being seized with an Ague, followed with a burning Fever, and extreme Pains in his Head and Bowels, attended with a great Evacuation of Blood; so that he tho't he must have perished in the Wilderness: But at last coming to an <HI>Indian</HI> Trader's Hutt, he got Leave to stay there; and tho' without Physick or Food proper for him, it pleased God, after about a Week's Distress, to relieve him so far that he was able to ride. He returned homewards from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, an Island far down the River&punc; where was a considerable Number of <HI>Indians,</HI> who appeared more free from Prejudices a|gainst Christianity, than most of the other <HI>Indians.</HI> He arrived at the Forks of <HI>Delaware</HI> on Thursday <HI>May</HI> 30, after having rode in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Journey about 340 Miles. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is the Journey which he occasionally mentions in his printed <HI>Journal,</HI> Pag. 53,&mdash;56.</NOTE> He came Home in a very weak State, &amp; under Dejection of Mind; which was a great Hindrance to him in religious Exercises. However, on the Sabbath, after having preach'd to the <HI>Indians,</HI> he preach'd to the <HI>white</HI> People, with some Success, from <HI>Isai.</HI> liii.10. <HI>Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him, &amp;c.</HI> some being awakened by his preaching. The next Day, he was much exercised for want of spiritual Life and Fervency.]</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>June</HI> 4. Towards Evening, was in Distress for God's Presence and a Sense of divine Things: Withdrew my self to the Woods, and spent near an Hour in Prayer and Me|ditation; and I think, the Lord had Compassion on me, and gave me some Sense of divine Things; which was indeed re|freshing &amp; quick'ning to me: My Soul enjoyed Intenseness and Freedom in Prayer, so that it griev'd me to leave the Place.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>June</HI> 5. Felt thirsting Desires after God, in the Morning. In the Evening, enjoyed a precious Season of Re|tirement: Was favoured with some clear and sweet Meditations upon a sacred Text: Divine Things open'd with Clearness and
<PB N="154" REF="006311_0187_0000000000000000">
Certainty, and had a divine Stamp upon them: My Soul was also enlarged and refresh'd in Prayer; and I delighted to continue in the Duty; and was sweetly assisted in praying for Fellow-Christians, and my dear Brethren in the Ministry. Blessed be the dear Lord for such Enjoyments. O how sweet &amp; precious it is, to have a clear Apprehension &amp; tender Sense of the <HI>Mystery of Godliness,</HI> of true Holiness, &amp; Likeness to the best of Beings! O what a Blessedness it is, to be as much like God, as 'tis possi|ble for a Creature to be like his great Creator! Lord, give me more of <HI>thy Likeness:</HI> I shall be <HI>satisfied, when I awake with it.</HI></P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>June</HI> 6. Was engaged, a considerable Part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Day, in Meditation and Study on divine Subjects. Enjoyed some special Freedom, Clearness, and Sweetness in Meditation. O how refreshing it is, to be enabled to improve Time well!</P>
<P>[The next Day, he went a Journey of near fifty Miles to <HI>Noshaming,</HI> to assist at a Sacramental Occasion, to be attended at Mr. <HI>Beaty</HI>'s Meeting-House; being invited thither by him and his People.]</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>June</HI> 8. Was exceeding weak and fatigued with Riding in the Heat Yesterday: But being desired, I preached in the Afternoon, to a crouded Audience, from <HI>Isai.</HI> xl.1. <HI>Comfort ye, Comfort ye my People, saith your God.</HI> God was pleased to give me great Freedom, in opening the Sorrows of God's Peo|ple, and in setting before them comforting Considerations. And, blessed be the Lord, it was a sweet melting Season in the Assem|bly.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>June</HI> 9. Felt some longing Desires of the Pre|sence of God to be with his People on the solemn Occasion of the Day. In the Forenoon, Br. <HI>Beaty</HI> preached; and there appear|ed some Warmth in the Assembly. Afterwards, I assisted in the Administration of the Lord's Supper: And towards the close of it, I discoursed to the Multitude <HI>extempore,</HI> with some Reference to that sacred Passage <HI>Isai.</HI> liii.10. <HI>Yet it pleased the Lord to br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Him.</HI> Here God gave me great Assistance in addressing Sinners: And the Word was attended with amazing Power; many Scores, if not Hundreds, in that great Assembly, consisting of three or four Thousand, were much affected; so that there was a <HI>very great Mourning, like the Mourning of</HI> Hadadrimmon.&mdash; In the Evening, I could hardly look any Body in the Face, be|cause of the Imperfections I saw in my Performances in the Day past.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="006311_0188_0000000000000000">Monday, <HI>June</HI> 10.

<P>Tuesday, <HI>June</HI> 11. Spent the Day mainly in Conversation with dear Christian Friends; and enjoyed some sweet Sense of divine Things. O how desirable it is, to keep Company with God's dear Children! These are the <HI>excellent Ones of the Earth, is whom,</HI> I can truly say, <HI>is all my Delight.</HI> O what Delight will it afford, to meet them all in a State of Perfection!

<P>[The next Day, he left Mr. <HI>Beaty</HI>'s, and went to <HI>Maidenhead</HI> in <HI>New Jersey</HI>; and spent the next seven Days in a com|fortable State of Mind, visiting several Ministers in those Parts.]</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>June</HI> 18. Set out from <HI>New-Brunswick</HI> with a Design to visit some <HI>Indians</HI> at a Place called <HI>Crosweeksung</HI> in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> towards the Sea. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> having, when at <HI>Boston,</HI> wrote and left with a Friend a brief <HI>Relation</HI> of Facts touching his Labours with the <HI>Indians</HI> and Reception among them, during the Space of Time between <HI>Nov.</HI> 5. 1744, and <HI>June</HI> 19. 1745.

<HEAD>PART VII. From his first Beginning to preach to the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Crosweeksung,</HI> 'till he re|turn'd from his last Journey to <HI>Susqua|hannah</HI> ill with the Consumption, whereof he died.</HEAD>
<P>[WE are now come to that Part of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Life, wherein he had his greatest <HI>Success,</HI> in his Labours for the good of Souls, and in his particular Business as a Missionary to the <HI>Indians.</HI> An Account of which, if here pub|lish'd, would doubtless be very entertaining to the Reader, after he has seen by the preceeding Parts of this Account of his Life, how great and long-continued his Desires for the spiritual Good of this Sort of People were, how he prayed, laboured, &amp; wrestled, and how much he denied himself and suffered, to this End. After all Mr. <HI>Brainerd's</HI> agonizing in Prayer, and travailing in Birth, for the Conversion of <HI>Indians,</HI> and all the Interchanges of his raised Hopes and Expectations, and then Disappointments and Discouragements; and after waiting in a Way of persevering Prayer, Labour and Suffering, as it were through a long <HI>Night</HI>; at length the <HI>Day</HI> dawns: <HI>Weeping continues for a Night, but Joy comes in the Morning. He went forth weeping, bearing precious Seed,</HI> and now he <HI>comes with Rejoycing, bringing his Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s with him.</HI> The desired Event is bro't to pass at last; but at a Time, in a Place, and upon Subjects, that scarce ever enter'd into his Heart. An Account of this would undoubtedly now much gratify the Christian Reader: And it should have been here in|serted, as it stands in his <HI>Diary,</HI> had it not been, that a particu|lar Account of this glorious and wonderful Success was drawn up b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> himself, pursuant to the Order of the ho|nourable Society in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and publish'd by him in his Life|time; which Account many have in their Hands; and the in|serting

it here would too much swell this Book, as was said before in the Preface. However, I look upon the want of this Account here, as a real Defect in this History of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Life; which, I would hope, those of my Readers, who are not already possess'd of his publick <HI>Journal,</HI> will supply, by procur|ing one of those Books, that they mayn't be without that which in some Respects is the most remarkable, and to a Christian Mind would be the most pleasant Part of the whole Story. That the Reader who is furnish'd with one of those Books, may know the <HI>Place</HI> where the Defects of this History are to be supplied from thence, I shall either expressly observe it as I go along, or else make a dash or stroke thus&mdash;Which when the Reader finds in this 7th Part of this History, he is to understand by it, that in that Place something in Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s <HI>Diary,</HI> worth observing, is <HI>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ft out,</HI> because the same for Substance was published before in his printed <HI>Journal.</HI>]</P>
<P>Wednesday <HI>June</HI> 19. 1745. Rode to the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Crosweek|sung</HI>: Found few at Home: Discoursed to them however; and observed them very serious and attentive. At Night I was ex|treamly worn out, and scarce able to walk or sit up. Oh, how tiresome is Earth! How dull the Body!</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>June</HI> 20. Towards Night, preach'd to the <HI>Indians</HI> again; and had more Hearers than before. In the Evening, enjoy'd some Peace and Serenity of Mind, some Composure and Comfort in Prayer alone; and was enabled to lift up my Head with some Degree of Joy, under an Apprehension that my Re|demption draws nigh. Oh, blessed be God, that there remains a Rest to his poor weary People!</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>June</HI> 21. Rode to <HI>Freehold,</HI> to see Mr. <HI>William Tennent</HI>; and spent the Day comfortably with him. My sinking Spirits were a little raised and encouraged; and I felt my Soul breath|ing after God, in the midst of Christian Conversation. And in the Evening, was refresh'd in secret Prayer: Saw my self a poor worthless Creature, without Wisdom to direct, or Strength to help my self. Oh, blessed be God, that lays me under a happy, a blessed Necessity of living upon himself!</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>June</HI> 22. About Noon, rode to the <HI>Indians</HI> again; and near Night, preach'd to 'em. Found my Body much strength|en'd, and was enabled to speak with abundant Plainness &amp; Warmth. And the Power of God evidently attended the Word; so that sundry Persons were brought under great Concern for their Souls, and made to shed many Tears, and to wish for Christ to save
<PB N="158" REF="006311_0191_0000000000000000">
them. My Soul was much refresh'd, and quicken'd in my Work&punc; and I could not but spend much Time with them, in order <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> open both their Misery and Remedy. This was indeed a sweet Afternoon to me. While riding, before I came to the <HI>Indians,</HI> my Spirits were refresh'd, and my Soul enabled to cry to God almost incessantly, for many Miles together. In the Evening also I found the Consolations of God were not small: I was then willing to live, and in some Respects desirous of it, that I might do something for the dear Kingdom of Christ; and yet Death appeared pleasant: So that I was in some Measure in a Strait between two, having a desire to depart. I am often weary of this World, and want to leave it on that Account: But '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> desirable to be drawn, rather than driven out of it.</P>
<P>[In the four next Days is nothing remarkable in his Diary&punc; but what is in his publick Journal.]</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>June</HI> 27.&mdash;My Soul rejoiced, to find, that God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|bled me to be faithful, and that he was pleased to awaken these poor <HI>Indians</HI> by my Means. O how Heart-reviving, and Soul-refreshing is it to me to see the Fruit of my Labours!</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>June</HI> 28.&mdash;In the Evening, my Soul was revived, and my Heart lifted up to God in Prayer, for my poor <HI>Indians,</HI> my Self and Friends, and the dear Church of God. And O how re|freshing, how sweet was this! Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not his Goodness and tender Mercy.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>June</HI> 29. Preach'd twice to the <HI>Indians</HI>; and could not but wonder at their Seriousness, and the Strictness of their Attention.&mdash; Blessed be God, that has inclined their Hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to hear. And O how refreshing it is to me, to see them attend with such uncommon Diligence and Affection, with Tears in their Eyes, and Concern in their Hearts! In the Evening, could not but lift up my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to God in Prayer, while riding to my Lodgings: And blessed be his Name, had Assistance and Free|dom. O how much <HI>better than Life</HI> is the Presence of God!</P>
<P>[His <HI>Diary</HI> gives an Account of nothing remarkable on the two next Days, besides what is in his publick Journal; except|ing his Heart's being lifted up with Thankfulness, rejoicing in God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>July</HI> 2. Rode from the <HI>Indians</HI> to <HI>Brunswick,</HI> near 40 Miles, and lodged there. Felt my Heart drawn out after God in Prayer, almost all the Forenoon; especially while riding.
<PB N="159" REF="006311_0192_0000000000000000">
And in the Evening, could not help crying to God for those poor <HI>Indians</HI>; and after I went to Bed, my Heart continued to go out to God for them, 'till I drop'd asleep. O blessed be God that I may pray!</P>
<P>[He was so beat out by constant preaching to these <HI>Indians,</HI> yielding to their earnest and importunate Desires, that he found it necessary to give himself some Relaxation. He spent therefore about a Week in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> after he left these <HI>Indians,</HI> visiting several Ministers, and performing some necessary Business, before he went to the Forks of <HI>Delaware.</HI> And tho' he was very weak i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Body, yet he seems to have been strong in Spirit.

<P>Thursday, <HI>July</HI> 18. Longed to spend the little Inch of Time I have in the World more for God. Felt a Spirit of Serious|ness, Tenderness, Sweetness, and Devotion, and wish'd to spend the whole Night in Prayer and Communion with God.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>July</HI> 19. In the Evening, walked abroad for Prayer and Meditation, and enjoyed Composure and Freedom in these sweet Exercises; especially in Meditation on Rev. iii.12. <HI>Him that overcometh, will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God</HI> &amp;c. This was then a delightful Theme to me, and it refreshed my Soul to dwell upon it. Oh, when shall I <HI>go no more out</HI> from the Service and Enjoyment of the dear Lord? Lord, hasten the Blessed Day.</P>
<P>[Within the Space of the next six Days, he speaks of much inward Refreshment and Enlargement, from Time to Time.]</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>July</HI> 26. In the Evening, God was pleased to help me in Prayer, beyond what I have experienced for some Time; especially my Soul was drawn out for the Enlargement of Christ's Kingdom, and for the Conversion of my poor People: and my Soul relied on God for the Accomplishment of that great Work. Oh, how sweet were the Thoughts of Death to me at this Time! Oh, how I longed to be with Christ, to be imployed in the glo|rious Work of Angels, and with an Angel's Freedom, Vigour
<PB N="160" REF="006311_0193_0000000000000000">
and Delight! And yet how willing was I to stay a while on Earth, that I might do something, if the Lord pleased, for his Interest in the World! My Soul, my very Soul, longed for the Ingathering of the poor Heathen; and I cried to God for them most willingly and heartily; and yet because I could not but cry. This was a sweet Season; for I had some lively Taste of Heaven, and a Temper of Mind suited in some Measure to the Employ|ments and Entertainments of it. My Soul was grieved to leave the Place; but my Body was weak and worn out, and it was near nine o'Clock. Oh, I longed that the remaining Part of my Life might be fill'd up with more Fervency and Activity in the Things of God! Oh the inward Peace, Composure, and God-like Serenity of such a Frame! Heaven must needs differ from this only in Degree, and not in Kind. <HI>Lord, ever give me this Bread of Life.</HI></P>
<P>[Much of this Frame seem'd to continue the next Day.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>July</HI> 28. In the Evening, my Soul was melted, and my Heart broken, with a Sense of past Barrenness and Dead|ness: And Oh, how I then longed to live to God, and bring forth much Fruit to his Glory!</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>July</HI> 29. Was much exercised with a Sense of Vileness, with Guilt and Shame before God.</P>
<P>[For other Things remarkable, while he was this Time at the Forks of <HI>Delaware,</HI> the Reader must be refer'd to his publick <HI>Journal.</HI> As particularly for his Labours and Success there among the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>On Wednesday, <HI>July</HI> 31. He set out on his Return to <HI>Cros|weeksung,</HI> and arrived there the next Day. In his Way thither, he had longing Desires that he might come to the <HI>Indians</HI> there, in the <HI>fulness of the Blessing of the Gospel of Christ</HI>; attended with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of his own great Weakness, Dependance and Worthlesness.]</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>August</HI> 2. In the Evening, I retired, and my Soul was drawn out in Prayer to God; especially for my poor Peo|ple, to whom I had sent Word that they might gather together, that I might preach to 'em the next Day. I was much enlarged in Praying for their saving Conversion; and scarce ever found my Desires of any Thing of this Nature so sensibly and clearly (to my own Satisfaction) disinterested, and free from selfish Views. It seem'd to me, I had no Care, or hardly any Desire to be the Instrument of so glorious a Work, as I wish'd and pray'd for among the <HI>Indians</HI>: If the blessed Work might be accomplished to the Honour of God, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Enlargement of the dear Redeemer's Kingdom, this was all my Desire and Care; and for this Mercy I hoped, but with Trembling; for I
<PB N="161" REF="006311_0194_0000000000000000">
felt what <HI>Job</HI> expresses, <HI>Chapter</HI> ix.16. My rising Hopes, re|specting the Conversion of the <HI>Indians,</HI> have been so often dash|ed, that my Spirit is as it were broken, and Courage wasted, and I hardly dare hope.</P>
<P>[Concerning his Labours and marvellous Success amongst the <HI>Indians,</HI> for the following 16 Days, let the Reader see his publick <HI>Journal.</HI> The Things worthy of Note in his <HI>Diary,</HI> not there published, are his earnest and importunate Prayers for the <HI>In|dians,</HI> and the <HI>Travail of his Soul</HI> for them from Day to Day; and his great Refreshment and Joy in beholding the wonderful Mercy of God, and the glorious Manifestations of his Power and Grace in his Work among them; and his ardent Thanks|givings to God; his Heart's rejoycing in Christ, as King of his Church, and King of his Soul; in particular, at the Sacra|ment of the Lord's Supper, at Mr. <HI>McNight</HI>'s Meeting-House; a Sense of his own exceeding Unworthiness; which sometimes was attended with Dejection and Melancholy.]</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 19.&mdash;Near Noon, I rode to <HI>Freehold,</HI> and preach'd to a considerable Assembly, from <HI>Matth.</HI> v.3. It pleased God to leave me to be very dry and barren; so that I don't re|member to have been so straiten'd for a whole twelve Month past. God is just, and he has made my Soul acquiesce in his Will in this Regard. 'Tis contrary to <HI>Flesh and Blood</HI> to be cut off from all Freedom, in a large Auditory, where their Expecta|tions are much raised; but so it was with me: And God helped me to say <HI>Amen</HI> to it; <HI>Good is the Will of the Lord.</HI> In the Even|ing, I felt quiet and composed, and had Freedom and Comfort in secret Prayer.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 20. Was composed and comfortable, still in a resigned Frame. Travelled from Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>'s in <HI>Freehold</HI> to <HI>Elisabeth-Town.</HI> Was refresh'd to see Friends, and relate to them what God had done, and was still doing among my poor People.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 21. Spent the Forenoon in Conversation with Mr. <HI>Dickinson,</HI> contriving something for the Settlement of the <HI>Indians</HI> together in a Body, that they might be under better Advantages for Instruction.

<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Sept.</HI> 8.&mdash;In the Evening, God was pleased to enlarge me in Prayer, and give me Freedom at the Throne of Grace: I cried to God for the Enlargement of his Kingdom in the World, and in particular among my dear People; was also enabled to pray for many dear Ministers of my Acquaintance, both in these Parts, and in <HI>New-England</HI>; and also for other dear Friends in <HI>New-England.</HI> And my Soul was so engaged and enlarged in that sweet Exercise, that I spent near an Hour in it, and knew not how to leave the Mercy-Seat. Oh, how I delighted to pray and cry to God? I saw, God was both able and willing to do all that I desired, for my self and Friends, and his Church in general. I was likewise much enlarged and assist|ed in Family-Prayer. And afterwards, when I was just going to Bed, God helped me to renew my Petitions with Ardency and Freedom.

I could appeal to God with the greatest Freedom, that he knew it was <HI>his</HI> dear Cause, and not my own, that engaged my Heart: And my Soul cried, <HI>Lord, set up thy Kingdom, for thine own Glory.

<P>Wednesday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 25. Rode still homeward.

Near Night, arrived at the <HI>Irish</HI> Settlement, about 15 Miles from mine own House. This Day, while riding, I was much exercised with a Sense of my Barrenness; and verily thought, there was no Creature that had any true Grace, but what was more spiritual and fruitful than I; I could not think that any of God's Children made so poor a Hand of living to God as I.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 27. Spent considerable Time, in the Morning, in Prayer and Praise to God. My Mind was somewhat intense in the Duty, and my Heart in some Degree warm'd with a Sense of divine Things: My Soul was melted, to think, that <HI>God had accounted me faithful, putting me into the Ministry,</HI> notwithstand|ing all my Barrenness and Deadness. My Soul was also in some Measure enlarged in Prayer for the dear People of my Charge, as well as for other dear Friends. In the Afternoon, visited some Christian Friends, and spent the Time, I think, profitably: My Heart was warm'd, and more engaged in the Things of God. In the Evening, I enjoyed Enlargement, Warmth, and Comfort in Prayer: My Soul relied on God for Assistance and Grace to enable me to do something in his Cause: My Heart was drawn out in Thankfulness to God for what he had done for his own Glory among my poor People of late: And I felt encouraged to proceed in his Work, being perswaded of his Power, and hoping <HI>his Arm</HI> might be further <HI>revealed,</HI> for the Enlargement of his dear Kingdom: And my Soul <HI>rejoyced in hope of the Glory of God,</HI> in Hope of the Advancement of his declarative Glory in the World, as well as of enjoying him in a World of Glory.

Being called by the Church and People of <HI>Easthampton</HI> on <HI>Long-Island,</HI> as a Member of a Council, to assist and advise in Affairs of Difficulty in that Church, I set out on my Journey this Morning, before it was well Light, and tra|velled to <HI>Elisabeth-Town,</HI> and there lodged.

<P>Friday, <HI>Nov.</HI> 15. Could not cross the Ferry by Reason of the Violence of the Wind; nor could I enjoy any Place of Retire|ment at the Ferry-House: So that I was in Perplexity. Yet God gave me some Satisfaction and Sweetness in Meditation, and lifting up my Heart to God in the midst of Company. And altho' some were drinking and talking profanely&punc; which was in|deed a Grief to me, yet my Mind was calm and composed.

<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Jan.</HI> 26 [At <HI>Connecticut-Farms.</HI>] Was calm and composed. Was made sensible of my utter Inability to preach, without divine Help; and was in some good Measure willing to leave it with God, to give or with-hold Assistance, as he saw would be most for his own Glory. Was favoured with a considerable Degree of Assistance in my publick Work. After publick Worship, I was in a sweet and solemn Frame of Mind, thankful to God that he had made me in some Measure faithful in addressing precious Souls, but grieved that I had been no more fervent in my Work; and was tenderly affected towards all the World, longing that every Sinner might be saved; and could not have entertain'd any Bitterness towards the worst Enemy living. In the Evening, rode to <HI>Elisabeth-Town</HI>: while riding, was almost constantly engaged in lifting up my Heart to God, lest I should lose that sweet heavenly Solemnity and Com|posure of Soul I then enjoyed. Afterwards, was pleased, to think, that GOD <HI>reigneth</HI>; and thought, I could never be un|easy with any of his Dispensations; but must be entirely Satis|fied, what ever Trials he should cause me or his Church to en|counter. Never felt more Sedateness, divine Serenity and Com|posure of Mind: Could freely have left the dearest earthly Friend, for the Society of <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>Spirits of just Men made perfect</HI>: My Affections soar'd aloft to the blessed Author of every dear Enjoyment: I view'd the Emptiness and Unsatisfac|tory Nature of the most desirable earthly Objects, any further than GOD is seen in them: and longed for a Life of Spirituality and inward Purity; without which, I saw, there could be no true Pleasure.</P>
<P>[He retained a great Degree of this excellent Frame of Mind, the four next Days. As to his publick Services for and among the <HI>Indians,</HI> and his Success in this Time, see the publick <HI>Journal.</HI>]</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="006311_0206_0000000000000000">Saturday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 1. Towards Night, enjoyed some of the clear|est Thoughts on a divine Subject (<HI>viz.</HI> that treated of 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv.13,&mdash;16.) that ever I remember to have had upon any Sub|ject whatsoever; and spent two or three Hours in writing them. I was refresh'd with this Intenseness: My Mind was so engaged in these Meditations, I could scarcely turn it to any Thing else; and indeed I could not be willing to part with so sweet an En|tertainment. &mdash;</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Feb.</HI> 2.&mdash; After publick Worship, my bodily Strength being much spent, my Spirits sunk amazingly; and es|pecially on hearing that I was so generally taken to be a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> sent by the <HI>Papists</HI> to draw the <HI>Indians</HI> into an Insur|rection against the <HI>English,</HI> that some were in Fear of me, and others were for having me taken up by Authority and punish'd. Alas, what will not the Devil do to bring a Slur and Disgrace on the Work of God! Oh, how holy and circumspect had I need to be! Thro' divine Goodness, I have been enabled to <HI>mind my own Business,</HI> in these Parts, as well as elsewhere; and to let all Men and all Denominations of Men alone, as to their <HI>Party-Notions</HI>; and only preach'd the plain and necessary Truths of <HI>Christianity,</HI> neither inviting to nor excluding from <HI>my meeting</HI> Any, of any Sort or Perswasion whatsoever. Towards Night, the Lord gave me Freedom at the Throne of Grace, in my first Prayer before my <HI>Catechetical</HI> Lecture: And in opening the xlvi. <HI>Psalm</HI> to my People, my Soul confided in God, altho' the wicked World should slander and persecute me, or even con|demn and execute me as a Traitor to my King and Country. Truly GOD is a <HI>present Help in Time of Trouble.</HI> In the Evening, my Soul was in some Measure comforted, having some Hope that one poor Soul was brought Home to God this Day; tho' the Case did by no Means appear clear. Oh that I could fill up every Moment of Time, during my Abode here below, in the Service of my God and King.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 3. My Spirits were still much sunk with what I heard the Day before, of my being suspected to be engaged in the <HI>Pretender's</HI> Interest: It griev'd me, that after there had been so much Evidence of a glorious <HI>Work of Grace</HI> among these poor <HI>Indians,</HI> as that the most carnal Men could not but take Notice of the great <HI>Change</HI> made among them, so many poor Souls should still suspect the whole to be only a <HI>Popish</HI> Plot, and so cast an awful Reproach on this blessed Work of the divine SPIRIT; and at the same Time wholly exclude themselves from receiving any Benefit by this divine Influence. This put me upon search|ing
<PB N="174" REF="006311_0207_0000000000000000">
whether I had ever drop'd any Thing inadvertently, that might give <HI>Occasion</HI> to any to suspect that I was stirring up the <HI>Indians</HI> against the <HI>English</HI>: And could think of Nothing, un|less it was my attempting sometimes to vindicate the Rights of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and complaining of the horrid Practice of making the <HI>Indians</HI> drunk, and then cheating them out of their Lands and other Properties: And once, I remembred, I had done this with too much Warmth of Spirit. And this much distress'd me; thinking that this might possibly prejudice them against this Work of Grace, to their everlasting Destruction. God, I be|lieve, did me good by this Trial; which served to humble me, and shew me the Necessity of Watchfulness, and of being <HI>wise as a Serpent,</HI> as well as <HI>harmless as a Dove.</HI> This Exercise led me often to the Throne of Grace; and there I found some Sup|port: Tho' I could not get the Burden wholly removed. Was assisted in Prayer, especially in the Evening.</P>
<P>[He remained still under a Degree of Exercise of Mind about this Affair; which continued to have the same Effect upon him, to cause him to reflect upon, and humble himself, and frequent the Throne of Grace: But soon found himself much more re|lieved and supported. He was, this Week, in an extremely weak State, and obliged (as he expresses it) <HI>to consume considera|ble Time in Diversion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for his Health.</HI></P>

<P>The Monday after, he set out on a Journey to the Forks of <HI>Delaware,</HI> to visit the <HI>Indians</HI> there. He performed the Jour|ney under great Weakness, and sometimes was exercised with much Pain; but says nothing of Dejection and Melancholy. He arrived at his own House at <HI>the Forks,</HI> on Friday. The Things appertaining to his inward Frames and Exercises, ex|press'd within this Week, are sweet Composure of Mind, Thank|fulness to God for his Mercies to him and others, Resignation to the divine Will, Comfort in Prayer and religious Conversation, his Heart drawn out after God, and affected with a Sense of his own Barrenness, as well as the Fulness and Freeness of divine Grace.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Feb.</HI> 16.&mdash; In the Evening, was in a sweet composed Frame of Mind. It was exceeding refreshing and comfortable, to think, that God had been with me, affording me some good Measure of Assistance. I then found Freedom and
<PB N="175" REF="006311_0208_0000000000000000">
Sweetness in Prayer and Thanksgiving to God; and found my Soul sweetly engaged and enlarged in Prayer for dear Friends and Acquaintance. Blessed be the Name of the Lord, that ever I am enabled to do any Thing for his dear Interest and Kingdom. Blessed be God who enables me to be faithful. Enjoyed more Resolution and Courage for God, and more Refreshment of Spirit, than I have been favoured with for many Weeks past.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 17.&mdash;I was refreshed and encouraged: Found a Spirit of Prayer, in the Evening, and earnest Longings for the Illumination and Conversion of these poor <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>[Tuesday <HI>Feb.</HI> 18. See the publick <HI>Journal.</HI>]</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 19.&mdash;My Heart was comforted and re|fresh'd, and my Soul fill'd with Longings for the Conversion of the <HI>Indians</HI> here.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 20.&mdash; God was pleased to support and refresh my Spirits, by affording me Assistance, this Day, and so hopeful a Prospect of Success; and I returned home rejoycing, and blessing the Name of the Lord; and found Freedom and Sweetness afterwards in secret Prayer, and had my Soul drawn out for dear Friends. Oh, how blessed a Thing is it, to labour for God faithfully, and with Encouragement of Success! Blessed be the Lord forever and ever, for the Assistance and Comfort granted this Day.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 21.&mdash;My Soul was refresh'd and comforted, and I could not but bless God, who had enabled me in some good Measure to be faithful in the Day past. Oh, how sweet it is to be spent and worn out for God!</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 22.&mdash; My Spirits were much supported, tho' my bodily Strength was much wasted. Oh that God would be gracious to the Souls of these poor <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>God has been very gracious to me this Week: He has enabled me to preach every Day; and has given me some Assistance, and encouraging Prospect of Success, in almost every Sermon. Blessed be his Name. Divers of the <HI>white</HI> People have been awaken'd this Week, and sundry of the <HI>Indians</HI> much cured of their Pre|judices and Jealousies they had conceived against Christianity, and some seem to be really awaken'd.</P>

he arrived there; but preach'd by the Way every Day, except|ing one; and was several Times greatly assisted; and had much inward Comfort, and earnest Longings to fill up all his Time with the Service of God. He utters such Expressions as these, after Preacing: <HI>Oh that I may be enabled to plead the Cause of God faithfully, to my dying Moment. Oh how sweet it would be to spend my self wholly for God, and in his Cause, and to be freed from selfish Motives in my Labours!</HI></P>
<P>[For Saturday and Lord's-Day, <HI>March</HI> 1 &amp; 2. See the pub|lick <HI>Journal.</HI> The four next Days were spent in great bodily Weakness; but he speaks of some Seasons of considerable inward Comfort.]</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>March</HI> 6. I walked alone in the Evening, and enjoyed Sweetness and Comfort in Prayer, beyond what I have of late enjoyed: My Soul rejoyced in my <HI>Pilgrimage-State,</HI> and I was delighted with the Thoughts of labouring and <HI>enduring Hardness</HI> for GOD: Felt some longing Desires to preach the Gospel to dear immortal Souls; and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ided in GOD, that HE would be <HI>with me</HI> in my Work, and that he <HI>never would leave nor forsake me,</HI> to the End of my Race. Oh, may I <HI>obtain Mercy of God to be faithful,</HI> to my dying Moment.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>March</HI> 7. In the Afternoon, went on in my Work with Freedom and Chearfulness, God assisting me; and enjoyed Comfort in the Evening.</P>
<P>[For the two next Days, see the publick <HI>Journal.</HI>]</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>March</HI> 10.&mdash; My Soul was refresh'd with Free|dom and Enlargement, and (I hope) the lively Exercise of Faith, in secret Prayer, this Night: My Will was sweetly resigned to the divine Will, and my Hopes respecting the Enlargement of the dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Kingdom of Christ somewhat raised, and could commit <HI>Zion</HI>'s Cause to God as his own.</P>
<P>[On Tuesday he speaks of some Sweetness and Spirituality in Christian Conversation. On Wednesday, complains that he enjoyed not much Comfort and Satisfaction, thro' the Day, because he did but little for God. On Thursday, spent consi|derable Time in Company, on a special Occasion; but in Per|plexity, because without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avory religious Conversation. For Friday, Saturday and Lord's-Day, see the publick <HI>Journal.</HI></P>
<P>In the former Part of the Week following he was very ill; and also under great Dejection; being, as he apprehended,

render'd unserviceable by his Illness, and fearing that he should never be Serviceable any more; and therefore exceedingly long|ed for Death. But afterwards was more encouraged, and Life appeared more desirable; because (as he says) he <HI>had a little D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wn of Hope, that he might be useful in the World.</HI> In the latter Part of the Week, he was in some Measure relieved of his Ill|ness, in the Use of Means prescribed by a Physician.</P>

<P>Monday, <HI>March</HI> 24.&mdash; After the <HI>Indians</HI> were gone to their Work, to clear their Lands, I got alone and poured out my Soul to God, that he would smile upon these feeble Beginnings, and that he would settle an <HI>Indian</HI> Town, that might be <HI>a Moun|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Holiness</HI>; and found my Soul much refresh'd in these Petitions, and much enlarged for <HI>Zion's</HI> Interest, and for Num|bers of dear Friends in particular. My sinking Spirits were re|vived and raised, and I felt animated in the Service God has called me to. This was the dearest Hour I have enjoyed for many Days, if not Weeks. I found an encouraging Hope, that something would be done for God, and that God would use and help me in his Work. And Oh, how sweet were the Thoughts of labouring for God, when I felt any Spirit &amp; Courage, and had any Hope that ever I should be succeeded!</P>
<P>[The next Day, his <HI>School-Master</HI> was taken Sick with a Pleurisy; and he spent great Part of the Remainder of this Week in tending him: which in his weak State was almost an over|bearing Burden to him; he being obliged constantly to wait upon him, all Day, from Day to Day, and to lie on the Floor at Night. His Spirits sunk in a considerable Degree, with his bodily Strength, under this Burden.</P>

<P>[The next Day, he was extremely busy in tending the School-Master, and in some other necessary Affairs, that greatly diverted him from what he looked upon as his proper Business: But yet speaks of Comfort and Refreshment, at some Times of the Day.]</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="006311_0211_0000000000000000">Wednesday, <HI>April</HI> 2. Was somewhat exercised with a spirit|less Frame of Mind. Was a little relieved and refresh'd in the Evening, with Meditation alone in the Woods. But alas, my Days pass away as the <HI>Chaff!</HI> 'Tis but little I do, or can do, that turns to any Account; and 'tis my constant Misery and Bur|den, that I am so Fruitless in the Vineyard of the Lord.

<P>Friday, <HI>April</HI> 4. Spent most of the Day in writing on <HI>Rev.</HI> xxii.17. <HI>And whosoever will,</HI> &amp;c. Enjoyed some Freedom and Encouragement in my Work; and found some Comfort and Composure in Prayer.</P>

<P>Monday, <HI>April</HI> 14. My Spirits this Day were raised and re|fresh'd&punc; and my Mind composed, so that I was in a comfortable Frame of Soul, most of the Day. In the Evening my Head was

And blessed be the Lord, I find my self relieved in this Respect.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>April</HI> 15. My Soul longed for more Spirituality; and it was my Burden, that I could do no more for God. Oh, my Barrenness is my daily Affliction and heavy Load! Oh, how precious is Time: and how it pains me, to see it slide away, while I do so very little to any good Purpose! Oh that God would make me more fruitful and spiritual.</P>
<P>[The next Day, he speaks of his being almost overwhelmed with vapoury Disorders; but yet not so as wholly to destroy the Composure of his Mind.]</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>April</HI> 17. Enjoyed some Comfort in Prayer, some Freedom in Meditation, and Composure in my Studies. Spent some Time in writing, in the Forenoon. In the Afternoon, spent some Time in Conversation with several dear Ministers. In the Evening, preach'd from <HI>Psal.</HI> lxxiii. 28. <HI>But it is good for me to draw near to God.</HI> God helped me to feel the Truth of my Text, both in the first Prayer and in Sermon. I was enabled to pour out my Soul to God, with great Freedom, Fer|vency, and Affection: And, blessed be the Lord, it was a com|fortable Season to me. I was enabled to speak with Tenderness, and yet with Faithfulness: And divine Truths seemed to fall with Weight and Influence upon the Hearers. My Heart was melted for the dear Assembly, and I loved every Body in it; and scarce ever felt more Love to immortal Souls in my Life; my Soul cried, <HI>Oh that the dear Creatures might be saved!

<P>Tuesday, <HI>April</HI> 22. My Mind was remarkably free, this Day, from melancholy Damps and Glooms, and animated in my Work.

In the Evening, was somewhat refresh'd with divine Things, and enjoyed a tender melting Frame in se|cret Prayer, wherein my Soul was drawn out for the Interest of <HI>Zion,</HI> and comforted with the lively Hope of the appearing of the Kingdom of the great Redeemer. These were sweet Mo|ments: I felt almost loth to go to Bed, and grieved that Sleep was necessary.

God was pleased to carry me thro' with some Competency of Freedom; and yet to deny me that Enlargement and Power I long'd for. In the Evening, my Soul mourn'd, and could not but mourn, that I had treated so excellent a Subject in so defective a Manner, that I had born so broken a Testimony for so worthy and glorious a Re|deemer. And if my Discourse had met with the utmost Applause from all the World (as I accidentally heard it applauded by some Persons of Judgment) it would not have given me any Satis|faction: Oh, it grieved me, to think, that I had had no more holy Warmth and Fervency, that I had been no more melted in discoursing of Christ's Death, and the End and Design of it! Afterwards, enjoyed some Freedom and Fervency in secret and Family-Prayer, and longed much for the Presence of God to attend his Word and Ordinances the next Day.</P>

Yet God, who is rich in Mercy, was pleased to give me Assistance, both in Prayer and preaching: God helped me to wrestle for his Presence, in Prayer&punc; and to tell him, that he had promised, <HI>Where two or three are met together in his Name, there he would be in the midst of them</HI>; and that we were, at least some of us, so met; and pleaded, that for his Truth's sake he would be with us. And blessed be God, it was sweet to my Soul, thus to plead, and rely on God's Promises. Discoursed upon <HI>Luke</HI> ix.30, 31. <HI>And behold there talked with him two Men, which were</HI> Moses <HI>and</HI> Elias; <HI>who appeared in Glory, and spake of his Decease, which he should accomplish at</HI> Jerusalem. Enjoyed special Freedom, from the Beginning to the End of my Discourse, without interruption. Things pertinent to the Subject were abundantly presented to my View, and such a Fulness of Mat|ter, that I scarce knew how to dismiss the various Heads and Particulars I had Occasion to touch upon. And, blessed be the Lord, I was favoured with some Fervency and Power, as well as Freedom; so that the Word of God seem'd to awaken the At|tention of a stupid Audience, to a considerab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Degree.

<P>Friday, <HI>May</HI> 16. Near Night, enjoyed some agreeable and sweet Conversation with a dear Minister, which, I trust, was bless'd to my Soul: My Heart was warmed, and my Soul en|gaged to live to God; so that I longed to exert my self with more Vigour, than ever I had done, in his Cause: And those Words were quickning to me, <HI>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bring forth much Fruit.</HI> Oh, my Soul longed, and wish'd, and pray'd, to be enabled to live to God with utmost Constancy and Ardour! In the Evening, God was pleased to shine upon me in secret Prayer, and draw out my Soul after himself; and I had Freedom in Supplication for my self, but much more in Inter|cession for others&punc; So that I wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sweetly constrain'd to say, <HI>Lord,

Oh, how sweet was this Evening to my Soul! I knew not how to go to Bed; and when got to Bed, longed for some Way to improve Time for God, to some excellent Purpose. <HI>Bless the Lord, O my Soul.</HI></P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>May</HI> 17. Walk'd out in the Morning, and felt much of the same Frame I enjoyed the Evening before: Had my Heart enlarged in praying for the Advancement of the Kingdom of Christ, and found utmost Freedom in leaving all my Concerns with God.</P>
<P>I find <HI>Discouragement</HI> to be an exceeding <HI>Hindrance</HI> to my spiritual Fervency and Affection: But when God enables me sensibly to find that I have done something <HI>for him,</HI> this re|freshes and animates me, so that I could break thro' all Hard|ships, undergo any Labours, and nothing seems too much either to do or to suffer. But Oh, what a Death it is, to strive, and strive; to be always in a <HI>Hurry,</HI> and yet do <HI>Nothing,</HI> or at least nothing <HI>for</HI> GOD! Alas, Alas, that Times <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> away, and I do so little for God!</P>

<P>On Tuesday he complains of Want of Freedom and Comfort; but had some Return of these on Wednesday.]</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>May</HI> 22. In the Evening, was in a Frame some|what remarkable: Had apprehended for several Days before, that it was the Design of Providence I should <HI>settle</HI> among my People here; and had in my own Mind begun to make Pro|vision for it, and to contrive Means to hasten it; and found my Heart something engaged in it, hoping I might then enjoy more agreeable Circumstances of Life, in several Respects: And yet was never fully determined, never quite pleased with the Thoughts of being settled and confin'd to one Place. Never|theless I seem'd to have some Freedom in that Respect, because the Congregation I thought of settling with, was one that God had enabled me to gather from amongst <HI>Pagans.</HI> For I never since I began to preach, could feel any Freedom to <HI>enter into other Men'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Labours,</HI> and settle down in the Ministry where the <HI>Gospel was preache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> before;</HI> I never could make that appear to be my Providence: When I felt any Disposition to consult my E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se and worldly Comfort, God has never given me any Liber|ty in that Respect, either since, or for some Years before I began to preach. But God having succeeded my Labours, and made me instrumental of gathering a Church for him among these <HI>Indians,</HI> I was ready to think, it might be his Design to give me
<PB N="185" REF="006311_0218_0000000000000000">
a quiet Settlement and a stated Home of my own. And this, considering the late frequent sinking and Failure of my Spirits, and the Need I stood in of some agreable Society, and my great Desire of enjoying Conveniencies and Opportunities for profi|table Studies, was not altogether disagreeable to me: Altho' I still wanted to go about far and wide, in order to spread the blessed Gospel among benighted Souls, far remote; yet I never had been so willing to settle in any one Place, for more than five Years past, as I was in the foregoing Part of this Week. But now these Thoughts seem'd to be wholly dash'd to Pieces; not by Necessity, but of Choice: For it appear'd to me, that God's Dealings towards me had fitted me for a Life of Solitari|ness and Hardship; it appeared to me I had nothing to lose, nothing to do with Earth, and consequently nothing to lose by a total Renunciation of it: And it appear'd just right, that I should be destitute of House and Home, and many Comforts of Life, which I rejoyced to see others of God's People enjoy. And at the same Time, I saw so much of the Excellency of Christ's Kingdom, and the infinite Desirableness of it's Ad|vancement in the World, that it swallowed up all my other Thoughts; and made me willing, yea, even rejoyce, to be made a Pilgrim or Hermet in the Wilderness, to my dying Moment, if I might thereby promote the blessed Interest of the great Redeemer. And if ever my Soul presented it self to God for his Service, without any Reserve of any Kind, it did so now. The Language of my Thoughts and Disposition (altho' I spake no Words) now were,
<Q><HI>Here I am,</HI> LORD, <HI>send me</HI>; send me to <HI>the Ends of the Earth</HI>; send me to the rough, the savage <HI>Pagans</HI> of the Wilderness; send me from all that is called Comfort in Earth, or earthly Comfort; send me even to Death it self, if it be but in thy Service, and to pro|mote thy Kingdom.</Q>
And at the same Time I had as quick and lively a Sense of the Value of worldly Comforts, as ever I had; but only saw them infinitely overmatch'd by the Worth of Christ's Kingdom, and the Propagation of his blessed Gospel. The quiet Settlement, the certain Place of Abode, the tender Friendship, which I thought I might be likely to enjoy in Con|sequence of such Circumstances, appeared as valuable to me, consider'd absolutely and in themselves, as ever before; but consider'd comparatively, they appeared nothing: Compared with the Value and Preciousness of an Enlargement of Christ's Kingdom, they vanish'd like the Stars before the rising Sun. And sure I am, that altho' the comfortable Accommodations of
<PB N="186" REF="006311_0219_0000000000000000">
Life appeared valuable and dear to me, yet I did surrender and resign my self, Soul and Body, to the Service of God, and Pro|motion of Christ's Kingdom; tho' it should be in the Loss of them all. And I could not do any other, because I could not will or chuse any other. I was constrained, and yet chose, to say, <HI>Farewell, Friends and earthly Comforts, the dearest of them all, the very dearest, if the Lord calls for it; Adieu, Adieu; I'll spend my Life, to my latest Moments,</HI> in Caves and Dens of the Earth, <HI>if the Kingdom of Christ may thereby be advanced.</HI> I found extraordinary Freedom at this Time in pouring out my Soul to God, for his Cause; and especially that his Kingdom might be extended among the <HI>Indians,</HI> far remote; and I had a great and strong Hope, that God would do it. I continued wrestling with God in Prayer for my dear little Flock here; and more especially for the <HI>Indians</HI> elsewhere; as well as for dear Friends in one Place and another; 'till it was Bed-Time, and I fear'd I should hinder the Family, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But Oh, with what Reluc|tancy did I find my self obliged to consume Time in Sleep! I longed to be as <HI>a Flame of Fire,</HI> continually glowing in the divine Service, preaching and building up Christ's Kingdom, to my latest, my dying Moment.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>May</HI> 23. In the Morning, was in the same Frame of Mind, as in the Evening before. The Glory of Christ's King|dom so much out-shone the Pleasure of earthly Accommodati|ons and Enjoyments, that they appeared comparatively Nothing, tho' in themselves good and desirable. My Soul was melted in secret Meditation and Prayer, and I found my self divorced from any Part in this World; so that in those Affairs that seem'd of the greatest Importance to me, in respect of the present Life, and those wherein the tender Powers of the Mind are most sensibly touch'd, I could only say, <HI>The Will of the Lord be done.</HI> But just the same Things that I felt the Evening before. I felt now; and found the same Freedom in Prayer for the People of my Charge, for the Propagation of the Gospel among the <HI>Indians,</HI> and for the Enlargement and spiritual Welfare of <HI>Zion</HI> in general, and my dear Friends in particular, now, as I did then; and longed to burn out in one continued Flame for God. Retain'd much of the same Frame through the Day. In the Evening, was visited by my Brother <HI>John Brainerd</HI>: The first Visit I have ever received from any near Relative, since I have been a Missionary. Felt the same Frame of Spirit in the Even|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> as in the Morning; and found that <HI>it was good for me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> God,</HI> and leave all my Concerns and Burdens with

<P>Saturday, <HI>May</HI> 24.&mdash; Enjoyed this Day something of the same Frame of Mind as I felt the Day before.</P>

<P>Monday, <HI>June</HI> 2. In the Evening, enjoy'd some Freedom in secret Prayer and Meditation.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>June</HI> 3. My Soul rejoyced, early in the Morning, to think, that all Things were at God's Disposal. Oh, it pleased me to leave 'em there! Felt afterwards much as I did, on Thursday Evening, <HI>May</HI> 22. last; and continued in this Frame for several Hours. Walked out into the Wilderness, and en|joyed Freedom, Fervency, and Comfort, in Prayer: And again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">joyed the same in the Evening.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>June</HI> 4. Spent the Day in Writing, and en|joyed some Comfort, Satisfaction, and Freedom in my Work. In the Evening, I was favoured with a sweet refreshing Frame of Soul in secret Prayer and Meditation. Prayer was now wholly turned into Praise, and I could do little else but try to adore and bless the living God: The Wonders of his Grace display'd in gathering to himself a Church among the poor <HI>In|dians</HI> here, were the Subject-Matter of my Meditation, and the Occasion of exciting my Soul to praise and bless his Name. My Soul was scarce ever more disposed to inquire, <HI>What I should render to God for all his Benefits,</HI> than at this Time. Oh, I was brought into a Strait, a sweet and happy Strait, to know what to do! I longed to make some Returns to God; but found I had nothing to return: I could only rejoyce, that GOD had done the Work himself; and that none in Heaven or Earth might pretend to share the Honour of it with him; I could only be glad, that God's declarative Glory was advanced by the Con|version of these Souls, and that it was to the Enlargement of
<PB N="188" REF="006311_0221_0000000000000000">
his Kingdom in the World: But saw I was so poor, that I had nothing to offer to him. My Soul and Body, thro' Grace, I could chearfully surrender to him: But it appear'd to me, this was rather a Cumber&punc; than a Gift: And nothing could I do to glorify his dear and blessed Name. Yet I was glad at Heart, that he was unchangeably possessed of Glory and Blessedness. Oh that he might be adored and praised by all his intelligent Creatures, to the utmost of their Power and Capacities. My Soul would have rejoyced to see others praise him, tho' I could do nothing towards it my self.</P>
<P>[The next Day, he speaks of his being subject to some De|gree of Melancholy; but of being something relieved in the Evening.</P>

God gave me some Freedom and Warmth in my Discourse; and I trust, his Pre|sence was in the Assembly. Was comfortably composed, and enjoyed a thankful Frame of Spirit; and my Soul was grieved that I could not render something to God for his Benefits bestow|ed. Oh that I could be swallowed up in his Praise!</P>
<P>Lord's Day, <HI>June</HI> 8. Spent much Time, in the Morning, in secret Duties; but between Hope and Fear, respecting the Enjoyment of God in the Business of the Day then before us. Was agreeably entertain'd, in the Forenoon, by a Discourse from Mr. <HI>Tennent,</HI> and felt somewhat melted and refresh'd. In the Season of Communion, enjoyed some Comfort; and especially in serving one of the Tables. Blessed be the Lord, it was a <HI>Time of Refreshing</HI> to me, and I trust, to many others. A Number of my dear People sat down by themselves at the last Table; at which Time God seem'd to be in the midst of them.&mdash; A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the Thoughts of what God had done among them were refreshing &amp; melting to me. In the Afternoon&punc; God enabled me to preach with uncommon Freedom, from 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v.20. Thro' the great Goodness of God, I was favoured with a constant Flow of pertinent Matter, and proper Expressions, from the Beginning to the End of my Discourse. In the Even|ing, I could not but rejoice in God, and bless him for the Mani|festations of Grace in the Day past. Oh, it was a sweet and solemn Day and Evening! A Season of Comfort to the Godly,

<P>Monday, <HI>June</HI> 9. Enjoyed some Sweetness in secret Duties.&mdash; Preach'd the concluding Sermon from <HI>Gen.</HI> v.24. <HI>And</HI> Enoch <HI>walked with God,</HI> &amp;c. God gave me Enlargement and Fer|vency in my Discourse; so that I was enabled to speak with Plainness and Power; and God's Presence seem'd to be in the Assembly. Praised be the Lord, it was a sweet Meeting, a desirable Assembly. I found my Strength renewed, and length|en'd out, even to a Wonder; so that I felt much stronger at the Conclusion, than in the Beginning of this Sacramental So|lemnity. I have great Reason to bless God for this Solemnity, wherein I have found Assistance in addressing others, and Sweet|ness in my own Soul.</P>

<P>Thursday, <HI>June</HI> 12. In the Evening, enjoyed Freedom of Mind, and some Sweetness in secret Prayer: It was a desirable Season to me; my Soul was enlarged in Prayer for my own dear People, and for the Enlargement of Christ's Kingdom, and especially for the Propagation of the Gospel among the <HI>Indians,</HI> back in the Wilderness. Was refresh'd in Prayer for dear Friends in <HI>New-England,</HI> and elsewhere: I found it sweet to pray at this Time; and could with all my Heart say, <HI>It is good for me to draw near to God.</HI></P>
<P>Friday, <HI>June</HI> 13.&mdash;I came away from the Meeting of the <HI>Indians,</HI> this Day, rejoycing and blessing God for his Grace manifested at this Season.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>June</HI> 14. Rode to <HI>Kingston,</HI> to assist the Rev. Mr. <HI>Wales</HI> in the Administration of the Lord's-Supper. In the Af|ternoon, preach'd; but almost fainted in the Pulpit: Yet God strengthen'd me when I was just gone, and enabled me to speak his Word with Freedom, Fervency and Application to the Con|science. And praised be the Lord; <HI>Out of weakness I was made strong.</HI> I enjoyed some Sweetness, in and after publick Worship; but was extreamly tired.

<P>On Friday and Saturday, he was very much amiss; but yet preach'd to his People on Saturday. His Illness continued on the Sabbath; but he preach'd, notwithstanding, to his People, both Parts of the Day: And after the publick Worship was ended, he endeavoured to apply divine Truths to the Conscien|ces of some, and address'd them personally for that End: Se|veral were in Tears, and some appeared much affected. But he was extremely wearied with the Services of the Day, and was so ill at Night, that he could have no bodily Rest; but re|marks, that <HI>God was his Support, and that he was not left desti|tute of Comfort in him.</HI> On Monday, he continued very Ill; but speaks of his Mind's being calm and composed, resigned to the divine Dispensations, and content with his feeble State.

God was pleased to assist me, to afford me both Freedom and Power; especially towards the close of my Discourses, both Forenoon, and Afternoon. God's Power appear'd in the As|sembly, in both Exercises. Numbers of God's People were refresh'd and melted with divine Things; one or two comfort|ed, who had been long under Distress: Convictions, in divers Instances, powerfully revived; and one Man in Years much awaken'd, who had not long frequented our Meeting, and ap|pear'd before as stupid as a Stock. God amazingly renewed and lengthen'd out my Strength. I was so spent at Noon, that I could scarce walk, and all my Joints trembled; so that I could not fit, nor so much as hold my Hand still: And yet God strengthened me to preach with Power in the Afternoon; altho' I had given out Word to my People, that I did not expect to be able to do it. Spent some Time afterwards in conversing, particularly, with several Persons, about their spiritual State; and had some Satisfaction concerning one or two. Pray'd af|terwards with a sick Child, and gave a Word of Exhortation. Was assisted in all my Work. Blessed be God. Returned home with more Health, than I went out with; altho' my Lin|nen was wringing wet upon me, from a little after ten in the Morning, 'till past five in the Afternoon. My Spirits also were considerably refresh'd; and my Soul rejoyced in Hope, that I had through Grace done something for God. In the Evening, walked out, and enjoyed a sweet Season in secret Prayer and Praise. But Oh, I found the Truth of the Psalmist's Words, <HI>My Goodness extendeth not to Thee!</HI> I could not make any Re|turns to God: I longed to live only to Him, and to be in Tune for his Praise and Service for ever. Oh, for Spirituality and holy Fervency, that I might <HI>spend and be spent</HI> for God, to my latest Moment!</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>June</HI> 30. Spent the Day in writing; but under much Weakness and Disorder. Felt the Labours of the pre|ceeding Day; altho' my Spirits were so refresh'd the Evening before, that I was not then sensible of my being spent.</P>

In the Afternoon, visited, and preach'd to my People, from <HI>Heb.</HI> ix.27. on Occasion of some Persons lying at the Point of Death, in my Congregation.

In the Afternoon, I preach'd from <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxiii.11. <HI>As I live, saith the Lord God,</HI> &amp;c. God favour'd me with Freedom and Fervency; and help|ed me to plead his Cause, beyond my own Power.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>July</HI> 7. My Spirits were considerably refresh'd and raised, in the Morning. There is no Comfort, I find, in any Enjoyment, without enjoying GOD and being engaged in his Service. In the Evening, had the most agreeable Conversation that ever I remember in all my Life, upon GOD's being <HI>all in all,</HI> and all Enjoyments being just <HI>that</HI> to us which GOD makes them, and no more. 'Tis good to begin and end with GOD. Oh, how does a sweet Solemnity lay a Foundation for true Pleasure and Happiness!</P>

<P>Friday, <HI>July</HI> 11.

Spent some little Time in writing: Visited the <HI>Indians,</HI> and spent some Time in serious Conversation with them; thinking it not best to preach, by Reason that many of them were absent.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>July</HI> 12. This Day was spent in Fasting and Pray|er by my Congregation, as preparatory to the Sacrament. I discoursed, both Parts of the Day, from <HI>Rom.</HI> iv.25. <HI>Who was delivered for our Offences,</HI> &amp;c. God gave me some Assistance in my Discourses, and something of divine Power attended the Word; so that this was an agreeable Season. Afterwards led them to a solemn Renewal of their Covenant, and fresh Dedica|tion of themselves to God. This was a Season both of Solemni|ty and Sweetness, and GOD seem'd to be <HI>in the midst of us.</HI> Re|turned to my Lodgings, in the Evening, in a comfortable Frame of Mind.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>July</HI> 13. In the Forenoon, discoursed on the <HI>Bread of Life,</HI> from <HI>Joh.</HI> vi.35. God gave me some Assistance, in Part of my Discourse especially; and there appear'd some tender Affection in the Assembly under divine Truths; my Soul also was somewhat refresh'd. Administred the Sacra|ment of the Lord's Supper to thirty-one Persons of the <HI>Indians.</HI> God seem'd to be present in this Ordinance; the Communi|cants were sweetly melted and refresh'd, most of them. Oh, how they melted, even when the Elements were first uncovered! There was scarcely a dry Eye among them, when I took off the Linnen, and shewed them the Symbols of CHRIST's <HI>broken Body.</HI>&mdash; Having rested a little, after the Administration of the Sacrament, I visited the Communicants, and found them generally in a sweet loving Frame; not unlike what appear'd among them on the former Sacramental Occasion, on <HI>April</HI> 27. In the Afternoon, discoursed upon <HI>coming to</HI> CHRIST, and the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> of those who do so, from the same <HI>Verse</HI> I insisted on in the Forenoon. This was likewise an agreeable Season, a
<PB N="194" REF="006311_0227_0000000000000000">
Season of much Tenderness, Affection and Enlargement in di|vine Service: And God, I am perswaded, crown'd our Assembly with his divine Presence. I returned home much spent, yet rejoicing in the Goodness of God.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>July</HI> 14. Went to my People, and discoursed to them from <HI>Psal.</HI> cxix.106. <HI>I have sworn, and I will perform it,</HI> &amp;c. Observed, 1. That all God's <HI>Judgments</HI> or Commandments are <HI>righteous.</HI> 2. That God's People have <HI>sworn</HI> to <HI>keep</HI> them; and this they do especially at the Lord's Table. There appear'd to be a powerful divine Influence on the Assembly, and consi|derable melting under the Word. Afterwards, I led them to a Renewal of their Covenant before God (that they would watch over themselves and one another, lest they should fall into Sin and dishonour the Name of Christ) just as I did on Monday <HI>April</HI> 28. This Transaction was attended with great Solemnity: And God seem'd to own it by exciting in them a Fear and Jealousy of themselves, lest they should Sin against God; so that the Presence of God seem'd to be amongst us in this Conclusion of the Sacramental Solemnity.</P>
<P>[The next Day, he set out on a Journey towards <HI>Philadel|phia</HI>; from whence he did not return 'till Saturday. He went this Journey, and spent the Week, under a great Degree of Illness of Body, and Dejection of Mind.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>July</HI> 20. Preach'd twice to my People, from <HI>Joh.</HI> xvii.24. <HI>Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me, be with me&punc; where I am, that they may behold my Glory, which thou hast given me.</HI> Was helped to discourse with great Clear|ness and Plainness in the Forenoon. In the Afternoon, enjoyed some Tenderness, and spake with some Influence. Divers were in Tears; and some, to Appearance, in Distress.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>July</HI> 21. Preach'd to the <HI>Indians,</HI> chiefly for the sake of some <HI>Strangers.</HI> Then proposed my Design of taking a Journey speedily to <HI>Sasquahannah</HI>: Exhorted my People to pray for me, that God would be with me in that Journey, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then chose divers Persons of the Congregation to travel with me. Afterwards, spent Time in discoursing to the <HI>Strangers,</HI> and was somewhat encouraged with them. Took Care of my People's secular Business, and was not a little exercised with it. Had some Degree of Composure and Comfort in secret Retirement.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>July</HI> 22. Was in a dejected Frame, most of the Day: Wanted to wear out Life, and have it at an End; but had some Desires of <HI>living to</HI> GOD, and wearing out Life <HI>for him.</HI> Oh that I could indeed do so!</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="006311_0228_0000000000000000">[The next Day, he went to <HI>Elisabeth-Town,</HI> to a Meeting of the <HI>Presbytery</HI>; and spent this, and Thursday, and the former Part of Friday, under a very great Degree of Melancholy, and exceeding Gloominess of Mind; not through any Fear of future Punishment, but as being distressed with a Senselesness of all Good, so that the whole World appear'd empty and gloomy to him. But, in the latter Part of Friday, he was greatly reliev'd and comforted.]</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>July</HI> 26. Was comfortable in the Morning; my Countenance and Heart were not sad, as in Days past; enjoy'd some Sweetness in lifting up my Heart to God. Rode Home to my People, and was in a comfortable pleasant Frame by the Way; my Spirits were much relieved of their Burden, and I felt free to go through all Difficulties and Labours in my Ma|ster's Service.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>July</HI> 27. Discoursed to my People, in the Fore|noon, from <HI>Luk.</HI> xii.37. on the Duty and Benefit of <HI>watch|ing</HI>: God helped me in the latter Part of my Discourse, and the Power of God appear'd in the Assembly. In the Afternoon, discoursed from <HI>Luk.</HI> xiii.25. Here also I enjoyed some Assist|ance, and the Spirit of God seem'd to attend what was spoken, so that there was a gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t Solemnity, and some Tears among <HI>In|dians</HI> and others.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>July</HI> 28. Was very weak, and scarce able to per|form any Business at all; but enjoyed Sweetness and Comfort in Prayer, both Morning and Evening; and was composed and comfortably thro' the Day: My Mind was intense, and my Heart fervent, at least in some Degree, in secret Duties; and I longed to <HI>spend and be spent for</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>July</HI> 29. My Mind was chearful, and free from those melancholy Damps, that I am often exercised with: Had Freedom in looking up to God, at sundry Times in the Day. In the Evening, I enjoyed a comfortable Season in secret Prayer; was help'd to plead with God for my own dear People, that he would carry on his own blessed Work among them; was assisted also in praying for the divine Presence to attend me in my intend|ed Journey to <HI>Susquahannah</HI>; was also helped to remember dear Brethren and Friends in <HI>New-England:</HI> scarce knew how to leave the Throne of Grace, and it grieved me that I was obliged to go to Bed; I longed to do something for God, but knew not how.

Was uncommonly comfortable, both in Body and Mind; in the Forenoon especially: My Mind was solemn, I was assisted in my Work, and God seem'd to be nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to me; so that the Day was as comfortable as most I have en|joyed for some Time. In the Evening, was favoured with Assistance in secret Prayer, and felt much as I did the Evening before.

<P>[He seems to have continued very much in the same free, comfortable State of Mind the next Day.]</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>August</HI> 1. In the Evening, enjoyed a sweet Season in secret Prayer; Clouds of Darkness and perplexing Care were sweetly scatter'd, and nothing anxious remain'd. Oh&punc; how serene was my Mind at this Season! How free from that distracting Concern I have often felt! <HI>Thy Will be done,</HI> was a Petition sweet to my Soul; and if God had bidden me chuse for my self in any Affair; I should have chosen rather to have refer'd the Choice to him; for I saw he was infinitely wise, and could not do any Thing amiss, as I was in Danger of doing. Was assisted in Prayer, for my dear Flock, that God would pro|mote his own Work among them, and that God would go with me in my intended Journey to <HI>Sasquahannah</HI>; was helped to remember dear Friends in <HI>New-England,</HI> and my dear Brethren in the Ministry. I found enough in the sweet Duty of Prayer to have engaged me to continue in it the whole Night, would my bodily State have admitted of it. Oh, how sweet it is, to be enabled heartily to say, <HI>Lord, not my Will, but thine be done!</HI></P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 2. Near Night, preach'd from <HI>Matth.</HI> xi.29. Was considerably helped; and the Presence of God seem'd to be somewhat remarkably in the Assembly; divine Truths made powerful Impressions, both upon Saints and Sinners. Blessed be God for such a Revival among us. In the Evening, was very weary, but found my Spirits supported and refresh'd.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Aug.</HI> 3. Discoursed to my People, in the Fore|noon, from <HI>Colos.</HI> iii.4. Observed, that <HI>Christ</HI> is the Believer's <HI>Life.</HI> God helped me, and gave me his Presence in this Dis|course; and it was a Season of considerable Power in the Assem|bly. In the Afternoon, preach'd from <HI>Luke</HI> xix.41, 42. I en|joyed some Assistance; tho' not so much as in the Forenoon. In the Evening, I enjoyed Freedom and Sweetness in secret

<P>Monday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 4. Spent the Day in writing; enjoyed much Freedom and Assistance in my Work: Was in a composed and comfortable Frame, most of the Day; and in the Evening enjoy|ed some Sweetness in Prayer. Blessed be God, my Spirits were yet up, and I was free from sinking Damps; as I have been in general ever since I came from <HI>Elisabeth-Town</HI> last. Oh what a Mercy is this!</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 5. Towards Night, preach'd at the Funeral of one of my Christians, from <HI>Isai.</HI> lvii.2. Was oppressed with the nervous Head-Ach, and considerably dejected: However, had a little Freedom, some art of the Time I was discoursing. Was extreamly weary in the Evening; but notwithstanding enjoyed some Liberty and Chearfulness of Mind in Prayer; and found the Dejection that I feared, much removed, and my Spirits considerable refresh'd.</P>
<P>[He continued in a very comfortable chearful Frame of Mind the next Day, with his Heart enlarged in the Service of God.]</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 7. Rode to my House, where I spent the last Winter, in order to bring some Things I needed for my <HI>Susqua|hannah</HI> Journey: Was refresh'd to see that Place, which God so marvellously visited with the Showers of his Grace. Oh how amazingly did the <HI>Power of</HI> GOD often appear there! <HI>Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all his Benefits.</HI></P>
<P>[The next Day, he speaks of Liberty, Enlargement, and Sweetness of Mind, in Prayer and religious Conversation.]</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 9. In the Afternoon, visited my People; set their Affairs in Order, as much as possible, and contrived for them the Management of their worldly Business: Discoursed to them in a solemn Manner, and concluded with Prayer. Was composed, and comfortable in the Evening, and somewhat fer|vent in secret Prayer: Had some Sense and View o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the eternal World, and found a Serenity of Mind. Oh that I could magnify the Lord for any Freedom he affords me in Prayer.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Aug.</HI> 10. Discoursed to my People, both Parts of the Day, from <HI>Acts</HI> iii.19. In discoursing of <HI>Repentance,</HI> in

the Forenoon, God helped me, so that my Discourse was search|ing, some were in Tears, both of the <HI>Indians</HI> and white People; and the Word of God was attended with some Power. In the Intermission-Season, I was engaged in discoursing to some in or|der to their Baptism; as well as with One who had then lately met with some Comfort, after spiritual Trouble and Distress. In the Afternoon, was somewhat assisted again, tho' weak and weary. Afterwards <HI>baptized</HI> 6 Persons; 3 Adults, and 3 Chil|dren. Was in a comfortable Frame in the Evening, and en|joyed some Satisfaction in secret Prayer. I scarce ever in my Life felt my self so full of Tenderness, as this Day.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 11. Being about to set out on a Journey to <HI>Susquahannah</HI> the next Day, with Leave of Providence, I spent some Time this Day in Prayer with my People, that God would bless and succeed my intended Journey, that he would send forth his blessed Spirit with his Word, and set up his Kingdom among the poor <HI>Indians</HI> in the Wilderness. While I was opening and applying Part of the cxth &amp; iid <HI>Psalms,</HI> the <HI>Power of God</HI> seem'd to defend on the Assembly in some Measure; and while I was making the first Prayer, Numbers were melted, and I found some affectionate Enlargement of Soul my self. Preach'd from <HI>Acts</HI> iv.31. God helped me, and my Interpreter also: There was a shaking and melting among us; and divers, I doubt not were in some Measure <HI>filled with the Holy Ghost.</HI> Afterwards, Mr. <HI>Mc Knight</HI> pray'd: I then open'd the two last Stanza's of the lxxiid <HI>Psalm</HI>; at which Time God was present with us; espe|cially while I insisted upon the Promise of <HI>all Nations blessing</HI> the great REDEEMER: My Soul was refresh'd, to think, that this Day, this blessed glorious Season, should surely come; and I trust, Numbers of my dear People were also refresh'd. After|wards pray'd; had some Freedom, but was almost Spent: Then walk'd out, and le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t my People to carry on religious Exercises among themselves: They pray'd repeatedly, and sung, while I rested and refresh'd my self. Afterwards, went to the Meeting; pray'd with, and dismiss'd the Assembly. Blessed be God, this has been a Day of Grace. There were many Tears and affectionate Sobs among us this Day. In the Evening, my Soul was refresh'd in Prayer: Enjoyed Liberty at the Throne of Grace, in praying for my People and Friends and the Church of God in general. <HI>Bless the Lord, O my Soul.</HI></P>
<P>[The next Day, he set out on his Journey towards <HI>Susqua|hannah,</HI> and six of his Christian <HI>Indians</HI> with him, whom he had

chosen out of his Congregation, as those that he judged most fit to assist him in the Business he was going upon. He took his Way through <HI>Philadelphia</HI>; intending to go to <HI>Susquahannah</HI>-River, far down along, where it is settled by the <HI>white</HI> People&punc; below the Country inhabited by the <HI>Indians</HI>; and so to travel up the River to the <HI>Indian</HI> Habitations: For altho' this was much further about, yet hereby he avoided the huge Mountains, and hideous Wilderness, that must be cross'd in the nearer Way; which in Time past he had found to be extremely difficult and fatiguing. He rode this Week as far as <HI>Charlestown,</HI> a Place of that Name about 30 Miles Westward of <HI>Philadelphia</HI>; where he arrived on Friday: And in his Way hither, was for the most Part in a composed comfortable State of Mind.]</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 16. [At <HI>Charlestown</HI>] It being a Day kept by the People of the Place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I now was, as preparatory to the Celebration of the Lord's Supper, I tarried; heard Mr. <HI>Treat</HI> preach; and then preach'd my self.

Afterwards, I was refresh'd in Spirit, tho' much tired; and spent the Even|ing agreeably, having some Freedom in Prayer, as well as Christian Conversation.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Aug.</HI> 17. Enjoyed Liberty, Composure, and Sa|tisfaction, in the secret Duties of the Morning: Had my Heart somewhat enlarged in Prayer for dear Friends, as well as for my self. In the Forenoon, attended Mr. <HI>Treat</HI>'s Preaching, par|took of the Lord's-Supper, five of my People also communi|cating in this holy Ordinance: I enjoyed some Enlargement and Out-going of Soul in this Season. In the Afternoon, preach'd from <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxiii.11. Enjoyed not so much sensible Assistance as the Day before; however, was helped to some Fervency in addressing immortal Souls. Was somewhat confounded in the Evening, because I thought I had done little or nothing for God; yet enjoyed some Refreshment of Spirit in Christian Conversation and Prayer. Spent the Evening, 'till near mid|night, in religious Exercises; and found my bodily Strength, which was much spent when I came from the publick Worship, something renewed before I went to Bed.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 18. Rode on my Way towards <HI>Paxton,</HI> upon <HI>Susquahannah</HI>-River. Felt my Spirits sink, towards Night, so that I had little Comfort.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="006311_0233_0000000000000000">Tuesday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 19.

<P>Wednesday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 20. Having lain in a cold Sweat all Night, I cough'd much bloody Matter this Morning, and was under great Disorder of Body, and not a little Melancholy; but what gave me some Encouragement, was, I had a secret Hope that I might speedily get a Dismission from Earth and all it's Toils and Sorrows. Rode this Day to one <HI>Chambers</HI>'s, upon <HI>Susquahannah,</HI> and there lodged. Was much afflicted, in the Evening, with an ungodly Crew, drinking, swearing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Oh, what a <HI>Hell</HI> would it be, to be numbred with the <HI>Ungodly!</HI> Enjoyed some agreeable Conversation with a Traveller, who seem'd to have some Relish of true Religion.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 21. Rode up the River about 15 Miles, and there lodg'd, in a Family that appear'd quite destitute of GOD. Laboured to discourse with the Man about the Life of Religion, but found him very artful in evading such Conversation. Oh, what a Death it is to some, to hear of <HI>the Things of</HI> GOD! Was out of my Element; but was not so dejected as at some Times.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 22. Continued my Course up the River; my People now being with me, who before were parted from me: Travelled above all the <HI>English</HI> Settlements; at Night, lodged in the open Woods; and slept with more Comfort, than while among an ungodly Company of white People. Enjoyed some Liberty in secret Prayer, this Evening; and was helped to re|member dear Friends, as well as my dear Flock, and the Church of God in general.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 23. Arrived at the <HI>Indian</HI> Town, called <HI>Shaumoking,</HI> near Night. Was not so dejected as formerly; but yet somewhat exercised. Felt somewhat composed in the Evening; enjoyed some Freedom in leaving my <HI>All</HI> with GOD: Thro' the great Goodness of God, I enjoyed some Liberty of Mind; was not distress'd with a Despondency, as frequently heretofore.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>August</HI> 24. Towards Noon, visited some of the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and discoursed with them about Christianity. In the Afternoon, discoursed to the <HI>King,</HI> and others, upon divine Things&punc; who seem'd disposed to hear. Spent most of the Day in these Exercises. In the Evening, enjoyed some Comfort and Satisfaction; and especially had some Sweetness in secret

Sent out my People that were with me, to talk with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and contract a Friendship and Familiarity with them, that I might have a better Opportunity of treating with them about Chris|tianity. Some Good seem'd to be done by their Visits this Day, divers appear'd willing to hearken to Christianity.

<P>Tuesday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 26. About Noon, discoursed to a considera|ble Number of <HI>Indians</HI>: God helped me, I am perswaded; I was enabled to speak with much Plainness, and some Warmth and Power. The Discourse had Impression upon some, and made them appear very serious. I thought&punc; Things now ap|pear'd as encouraging, as they did at <HI>Crosweeks.</HI> At the Time of my first Visit to those <HI>Indians,</HI> I was a little encouraged: I pressed Things with all my Might; and call'd out my Peo|ple, who were then present, to give in <HI>their Testimony</HI> for God; which they did. Towards Night, was refresh'd; felt a Heart to pray for the setting up of God's Kingdom here; as well as for my dear Congregation below, and my dear Friends elsewhere.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 27. There having been a thick Smoak, in the House where I lodged, all Night before, whereby I was almost chocked, I was this Morming distress'd with Pains in my Head and Neck, and could have no Rest. In the Morning, the Smoak was still the same; and a cold easterly Storm gathering, I could neither live within Doors nor without any long Time together; I was pierced with the Rawness of the Air abroad, in the House distress'd with the Smoak. I was this Day very vapoury, and lived in great Distress, and had not Health enough to do any Thing to any Purpose.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 28. In the Forenoon, was under great Concern of Mind about my Work. Was visited by some who desired to hear me preach; discoursed to 'em, in the After|noon, with some Fervency, and laboured to perswade 'em to <HI>turn to God.</HI> Was full of Concern for the Kingdom of Christ, and found some Enlargement of Soul in Prayer, both in secret and in my Family.

<P>Friday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 29. Felt the same Concern of Mind, as the Day before. Enjoyed some Freedom in Prayer, and a Satis|faction to leave all with God.

<P>Saturday, <HI>Aug.</HI> 30. Spent the Forenoon in visiting a <HI>Trader,</HI> that came down the River <HI>sick</HI>; who appeared as ignorant as any <HI>Indian.</HI> In the Afternoon, spent some Time in Writing, Reading and Prayer.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Aug.</HI> 31. Spent much Time, in the Morning, in secret Duties: Found a Weight upon my Spirits, and could not but cry to God with Concern and Engagement of Soul. Spent some Time also in reading and expounding God's Word to my dear Family, that was with me, as well as in Singing and Prayer with them. Afterwards, spake the Word of God, to some few of the <HI>Susquahannah-Indians.</HI> In the Afternoon, felt very weak and feeble. Near Night, was something refresh'd in Mind, with some Views of Things relating to my great Work. Oh, how heavy is my Work, when <HI>Faith</HI> can't take hold of an <HI>Almighty Arm,</HI> for the Performance of it: Many Times have I been ready to sink in this Case.

<P>Tuesday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 2. Rode forward; but no faster than my People went on Foot.

Discoursed with the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the Morning, about Christianity; my <HI>Interpreter,</HI> afterwards, car|rying on the Discourse, to a considerable Length: Some few appeared well-disposed, and somewhat affected. Left this Place, and returned towards <HI>Shaumocking</HI>; and at Night lodged in the Place where I lodged the Monday-Night before: Was in very uncomfortable Circumstances in the Evening&punc; my People being belated, and not coming to me 'till past 10 at Night; so that I had no Fire to dress any Victuals, or to keep me Warm, or keep off wild Beasts; and I was scarce ever more weak and worn out in all my Life. However, I lay down and slept be|fore my People came up, expecting Nothing else but to spend the whole Night alone and without Fire.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 5. Was exceeding weak, so that I could scarce|ly ride; it seem'd sometimes as if I must fall off from my Horse, and lie in the open Woods: However, got to <HI>Shaumocking,</HI> towards Night: Felt something of a Spirit of Thankfulness, that God had so far return'd me: Was refresh'd, to see one of my Christians, whom I left here in my late Excursion.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 6. Spent the Day in a very weak State; Coughing and spitting Blood, and having little Appetite to any Food I had with me: Was able to do very little, except discourse a while of divine Things to my own People, and to some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew I met with. Had, by this Time, very little Life or

Heart to speak for God, thro' Feebleness of Body, and Flatness of Spirits. Was scarcely ever more ashamed and confounded in my self, than now. I was sensible, that there were Num|bers of God's People, who knew I was then out upon a Design (or at least the Pretence) of doing something for God, and in his Cause, among the poor <HI>Indians</HI>; and they were ready to suppose, that I was <HI>fervent in Spirit:</HI> But Oh, the heartless Frame of Mind that I felt, fill'd we with Confusion! Oh (methought) if God's People knew me, as God knows, they would not think so highly of my Zeal and Resolution for God, as perhaps now they do! I could not but desire they shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d see how heartless and irresolute I was, that they might be undeceived, and <HI>not think of me above what they ought to think.</HI> And yet I thought, if they saw the utmost of my Flat|ness and Unfaithfulness, the Smallness of my Courage and Re|solution for God, they would be ready to shut me out of their Doors, as unworthy of the Company or Friendship of Christians.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Sept.</HI> 7. Was much in the same weak State of Body, and afflicted Frame of Mind, as in the preceeding Day: My Soul was grieved, and mourn'd that I could do nothing for God. Read and expounded some Part of God's Word to my own dear Family, and spent some Time in Prayer with them; discoursed also a little to the <HI>Pagans:</HI> But spent the Sabbath with a little Comfort.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 8. Spent the Forenoon among the <HI>Indians</HI>; in the Afternoon, left <HI>Shaumoking,</HI> and returned down the River, a few Miles. Had proposed to have tarried a conside|rable Time longer among the <HI>Indians</HI> upon <HI>Susquahannah</HI>; but was hindred from pursuing my Purpose by the Sickness that prevailed there, the weakly Circumstances of my own People that were with me, &amp; especially my own extraordinary Weak|ness, having been exercised with great nocturnal Sweats, and a coughing up of Blood, in almost the whole of the Journey; and was a great Part of the Time so feeble and faint, that it seem'd as tho' I never should be able to reach home; and at the same Time very destitute of the Comforts &amp; even Necessaries of Life; at least, what was necessary for one in so weak a State. In this Journey I sometimes was enabled to speak the Word of God with some Power, and divine Truths made some Impres|sions on divers that heard me; so that several, both Men and Women, old and young, seem'd to <HI>cleave to us,</HI> and be well disposed towards <HI>Christianity</HI>; but <HI>others mocked</HI> and shouted, which damp'd those who before seem'd friendly, at least some

of them&punc; Yet God, at Times, was evidently present, assisting me, my Interpreter, and other dear Friends who were with me: God gave, sometimes, a good Degree of Freedom in Pray|er for the ingathering of Souls there; and I could not but en|tertain a strong Hope, that the Journey should not be wholly fruitless. Whether the Issue of it would be the setting up Christ's Kingdom <HI>there,</HI> or only the drawing of some few Persons down to my Congregation in <HI>New-Jersey</HI>; or whether they were now only preparing for some further Attempts, that might be made among them, I did not determine: But I was perswaded, the Journey would not be lost. Blessed be God, that I had any Encouragement and Hope.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 9. Rode down the River, near 30 Miles. Was extreme weak, much fatigued, and wet with a Thunder-Storm. Discoursed with some Warmth and Closeness to some poor ignorant Souls, on the <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI>; what were and what were not the <HI>Evidences</HI> of it. They seem'd much astonish'd, when they saw my <HI>Indians</HI> ask a Blessing and give Thanks at Dinner; concluding <HI>that</HI> a very high Evidence of Grace in them: But were astonished, when I insisted, that neither that, nor yet secret Prayer, was any sure Evidence of Grace. Oh the Ignorance of the World! How are some empty outward <HI>Forms,</HI> that may all be intirely <HI>selfish,</HI> mistaken for true Religion, infallible Evidences of it! The Lord pity a deluded World.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 10. Rode near twenty Miles homeward. Was much solicited to preach, but was utterly unable, thro' bodily Weakness. Was extremely overdone with the Heat and Showers this Day, and coughed up considerable Blood.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 11. Rode homeward; but was very weak, and sometimes scarce able to ride. Had a very importunate In|vitation to preach at a Meeting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">House I came by, the People be|ing then gathering; but could not, by Reason of Weakness. Was res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ned and composed under my Weakness; but was much exercised with Concern for my Companions in Travel, whom I had left with much Regret, some lame, and some sick.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 12. Rode about fifty Miles; and came just at Night to a Christian Friend's House, about 25 Miles Westward from <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> Was courteously received, and kindly en|tertain'd, and found my self much refresh'd in the midst of my Weakness and Fatigues.</P>

<P>Thursday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 18. Went from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to Mr. <HI>Treat's</HI>: Was agreeably entertain'd on the Road; and was in a sweet composed Frame, in the Evening.</P>

<P>Saturday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 20. Arrived among my own People, just at Night: Found 'em praying together: Went in, and gave them some Account of God's Dealings with me and my Companions in the Journey; which seem'd affecting to them. I then pray'd with them, and thought the divine Presence was amongst us; divers were melted into Tears, and seem'd to have a Sense of

Thus God has carried me thro' the Fatigues and Perils of ano|ther Journey to <HI>Sasquahannah,</HI> and returned me again in Safety, tho' under a great Degree of bodily Indisposition.

I have often been feverish, and unable to rest quietly after Preaching; but this was the most severe distressing Turn, that ever Preaching brought upon me.

Finishing what I had proposed to offer upon the Subject the Sabbath before. The Sermon was bless'd of God to the stirring up religious Affection, and a Spirit of Devotion, in the Peo|ple of God; and to the greatly affecting one who had <HI>back|slidden</HI> from God, which caused him to judge and condemn himself. I was surprizingly strengthned in my Work, while I was speaking: But was obliged immediately after to repair to Bed, being now removed into my own House among the <HI>In|dians</HI>; which gave me such speedy Relief and Refreshment, as I could not well have liv'd without. Spent some Time on Friday-Night in conversing with my People about divine Things, as I lay upon my Bed; and found my Soul refresh'd, tho' my Body was weak. This being Saturday, I discoursed particu|larly with divers of the Communicants; and this Afternoon preach'd from <HI>Zech.</HI> xii.10. There seem'd to be a tender Melting, and hearty mourning for Sin, in Numbers in the Con|gregation.

(3) From his being that <HI>Atonement,</HI> which was pointed out in the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of Lambs, and in particular by the <HI>paschal</HI> Lamb. II.

And observed, that the Means and Manner, in and by which he takes away the Sins of Men, was his <HI>giving himself for them,</HI> doing and suffering in their Room and Stead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And he is said to take away the Sin of <HI>the World,</HI> not because <HI>all</HI> the World shall <HI>actually</HI> be redeemed from Sin by him, but because, (1) He has done and suffered <HI>sufficient</HI> to answer for the Sins of the World, and so to redeem all Mankind; (2) He <HI>actually</HI> does take away the Sins of the <HI>elect</HI> World. And III. Considered how we are to <HI>behold</HI> him, in order to have our Sins taken away. (1) Not with our <HI>bodily</HI> Eyes: Nor (2) By <HI>imagining</HI> him on the Cross, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But by a <HI>spiritual</HI> View of his Glory and Goodness, engaging the Soul to <HI>rely</HI> on him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;The divine Presence attended this Discourse; and the Assembly was con|siderably melted with divine Truths.

It seem'd to be a Season of divine Power and Grace; and Numbers seem'd to rejoyce in God. Oh, the sweet Union and Harmony then appearing among the religious People! My Soul was refresh'd, and my religious Friends, of the white People, with me. After the Sacrament, could scarcely get home, tho' it was not more than 20 Rods; but was sup|ported and led by my Friends, and laid on my Bed; where I lay in Pain 'till some Time in the Evening; and then was able to fit up and discourse with Friends. Oh, how was this Day spent in Prayers and Praises among my dear People!

Rode to <HI>Prince-Town,</HI> in a very weak State: Had such a violent Fever, by the Way, that I was forced to alight at a Friends's House; and lie down for some Time. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Night, was visited by Mr. <HI>Treat,</HI> Mr. <HI>Beaty,</HI> and his Wife,
<PB N="214" REF="006311_0247_0000000000000000">
and another Friend: My Spirits were refresh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, to see them; but I was surprized, and even ashamed, that they had taken so much Pains as to ride 30 or 40 Miles to see me! Was able to sit up most of the Evening; and spent the Time in a very com|fortable Manner with my Friends.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 29. Rode about 10 Miles, with my Friends that came Yesterday to see me; and then parted with them, all but one, who stay'd on Purpose to keep me Compa|ny, and cheer my Spirits. Was extreme weak, and very feverish, especially towards Night; but enjoyed Comfort and Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 30. Rode 3 or 4 Miles, to visit Mr. <HI>Wales:</HI> Spent some Time, in an agreable Manner, in Conversation; and tho' extreme weak, enjoyed a comfortable composed Frame of Mind.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 31. Spent the Day among Friends, in a com|fortable Frame of Mind, tho' exceeding weak, and under a considerable Fever.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>November</HI> 1. Took Leave of Friends, after hav|ing spent the Forenoon with them, and returned Home to my own House. Was much disordered in the Evening, and op|press'd with my Cough; which has now been constant for, a long Time, with a hard Pain in my Breast, and Fever.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Nov.</HI> 2. Was unable to preach, and scarcely able to sit up, the whole Day. Was grieved, and almost sunk, to see my poor People destitute of the Means of Grace; espe|cially considering they could not read, and so were under great Disadvantages for spending the Sabbath comfortably. Oh, me|thought, I could be contented to be sick, if my poor Flock had a faithful Pastor to feed them with spiritual Knowledge! A View of their Want of this was more afflictive to me, than all my bodily Illness.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Nov.</HI> 3. Being now in so weak and low a State, that I was utterly uncapable of performing my Work, and hav|ing little Hope of Recovery, unless, by much Riding, I thought it my Duty to take a lengthy Journey into <HI>New-England,</HI> and to divert my self among my Friends, whom I had not now seen for a long Time. And accordingly took Leave of my Congregation this Day.&mdash; Before I left my People, I visited them all in their respective Houses, and discoursed to each one, as I thought most proper and suitable for their Circumstances, and found great Freedom and Assistance in so doing: I scarcely left one House but some were in Tears; and many were not only affected
<PB N="215" REF="006311_0248_0000000000000000">
with my being about to <HI>leave</HI> them, but with the solemn <HI>Ad|dresses</HI> I made them upon divine Things; for I was helped to be <HI>fervent in Spirit,</HI> while I discoursed to them. When I had thus gone through my Congregation (which took me most of the Day) and had taken Leave of them, and of the School, I left Home, and rode about two Miles, to the House where I lived in the Summer past, and there lodg'd. Was refresh'd, this Evening, in that I had left my Congregation so well disposed and affected, and that I had been so much assisted in making my Farewel Addresses to them.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>Nov.</HI> 4. Rode to <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> and lodg'd with Mr. <HI>Pierson</HI>; continuing still in a very weak State.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Nov.</HI> 5. Rode to <HI>Elisabeth-Town</HI>; intending, as soon as possible, to prosecute my Journey into <HI>New-England.</HI> But was, in an Hour or two after my Arrival, taken much worse.</P>
<P>After this, for near a Week, was confined to my Chamber, and most of the Time to my Bed: And then so far revived as to be able to walk about the House; but was still confined within Doors.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of this extraordinary Turn of Disorder, after my coming to <HI>Elisabeth-Town,</HI> I was enabled thro' Mercy to maintain a calm composed and patient Spirit, as I had been before from the Beginning of my Weakness. After I had been in <HI>Elisabeth-Town</HI> about a Fortnight, and had so far recovered that I was able to walk about House, upon a Day of Thanks|giving kept in this Place, I was enabled to recall and recount over the Mercies of God, in such a Manner as greatly affected me, and fill'd me (I think) with Thankfulness and Praise to God: Especially my Soul prais'd him for his Work of Grace among the <HI>Indians,</HI> and the Enlargement of his dear Kingdom: My Soul bless'd God for what he is in himself, and adored him, that he ever would display himself to Creatures: I rejoyced, that he was God, and longed that all should know it, and feel it, and rejoyce in it. <HI>Lord, glorify thy self,</HI> was the Desire and Cry of my Soul. Oh that <HI>all People</HI> might love and praise the blessed God: That he might have all possible Honour and Glory from the intelligent World. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">About this Time he wrote the 7th <HI>Letter,</HI> published at the End of this Account of his Life.</NOTE></P>
<P>After this comfortable Thanksgiving-Season, I frequently en|joyed Freedom and Enlargement and Engagedness of Soul in
<PB N="216" REF="006311_0249_0000000000000000">
Prayer, and was enabled to intercede with God for my dear Congregation, very often for very Family, and every Person, in particular; and it was often a great Comfort to me, that I could pray heartily to God for those, to whom I could not speak, and whom I was not allowed to see. But at other Times, my Spirits were so flat and low, and my bodily Vigour so much wasted, that I had scarce any Affections at all.</P>
<P>In <HI>December,</HI> I had revived so far as to be able to walk abroad, and visit Friends, and seem'd to be on the gaining Hand with Regard to my Health, in the main, untill Lord's-Day <HI>Decemb.</HI> 21. At which Time I went to the publick Worship; and it being Sacrament-Day, I laboured much, at the Lord's-Table, to bring forth a certain Corruption, and have it <HI>slain,</HI> as being an <HI>Enemy</HI> to God and my own Soul; and could not but hope, that I had gain'd some Strength against this, as well as other Corrup|tions; and felt some Brokenness of Heart for my Sin.</P>
<P>After this, having perhaps taken some Cold, I began to de|cline as to bodily Health; and continued to do so, 'till the latter End of <HI>January,</HI> 1746, 7. And having a violent Cough, a con|siderable Fever, and asthmatick Disorder, and no Appetire for any Manner of Food, nor any Power of Digestion, I was re|duced to so low a State, that my Friends (I believe) generally despaired of my Life; and some of them, for some Time toge|ther, thought I could scarce live a Day to an End. In this Time, I could think of nothing with any Application of Mind, and seemed to be in a great Measure void of all Affection, and was exercised with great Temptations; but yet was not, ordinarily, afraid of Death.</P>
<P>On Lord's-Day, <HI>Feb.</HI> 1. Tho' in a very weak and low State, I enjoyed a considerable deal of Comfort and Sweetness in divine Things; and was enabled to plead and use Arguments with God in Prayer, I think, with a Child-like Spirit. That Passage of Scripture occur'd to my Mind, and gave me great Assistance, <HI>If ye, being Evil, know how to give good Gifts to your Children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</HI> This Text I was helped to plead, and insist upon; and saw the divine Faithfulness engaged for dealing with me better than any earthly Parent can do with his Child. This Season so refresh'd my Soul, that my Body seem'd also to be a Gainer by it. And from this Time, I began gradually to amend. And as I recovered some Strength, Vigour and Spirit, I found at Times some Freedom and Life in the Exercises of Devotion, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me Longing&punc; after Spirituality and a Life of Usefulness to
<PB N="217" REF="006311_0250_0000000000000000">
the Interests of the great Redeemer: Altho' at other Times, I was awfully barren and lifeless, and out of Frame for the Things of God; so that I was ready often to cry out, <HI>Oh that it were with me as in Months past!</HI> Oh that God had taken me away in the midst of my Usefulness, with a sudden Stroke, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat I might not have been under a necessity of trifling away Time in Diversions! Oh that I had never lived to spend so much pre|cious Time, in so poor a Manner, and to so little Purpose! Thus I often reflected, was grieved, ashamed, and even con|founded, sunk and discouraged.</P>
<P>On Tuesday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 24. I was able to ride as far as <HI>Newark,</HI> (having been confined within <HI>Elisabeth-Town</HI> almost four Months) and the next Day returned to <HI>Elisabeth-Town.</HI> My Spirits were somewhat refresh'd with the Ride, tho' my Body was weary.</P>
<P>On Saturday, <HI>Feb.</HI> 28. Was visited by an <HI>Indian</HI> of my own Congregation; who brought me Letters, and good News of the sober and good Behaviour of my People, in general: This refresh'd my Soul; I could not but soon retire, and bless God for his Goodness; and sound, I trust, a truly thankful Frame of Spirit, that God seem'd to be building up that Con|gregation for himself.</P>
<P>On Wednesday, <HI>March</HI> 4. I met with Reproof from a Friend, which, altho' I thought I did not deserve it from him, yet was (I trust) bless'd of God to make me more tenderly afraid of Sin, more jealous over my self, and more concerned to keep both Heart and Life pure and unblameable: It likewise caused me to reflect on my past Deadness, and want of Spiritu|ality, and to abhor my self, and look on my self most unworthy. This Frame of Mind continued the next Day; and for several Days after, I grieved, to think, that in my necessary Diversions I had not maintain'd more Seriousness, Solemnity, heavenly Affection and Conversation. And thus my Spirits were often depress'd and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unk, and yet, I trust, that Reproof was made to be beneficial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o me.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>March</HI> 11. Being kept in <HI>Elisabeth-Town</HI> as a Day of Fasting and Prayer, I was able to attend publick Wor|ship; which was the first Time I was able so to do after <HI>Dec.</HI> 21. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, how much Weakness and Distress did God carry me thro' in this Space of Time! But <HI>having obtain'd Help from him, I</HI> yet live: Oh that I could live more to his Glory.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>March</HI> 15. Was able again to attend the publick Worship, and felt some earnest Desires of being re|stored
<PB N="218" REF="006311_0251_0000000000000000">
to the Ministerial Work: Felt, I think, some Spirit and Life, to speak for God.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>March</HI> 18. Rode out with a Design to visit my People: And the next Day arrived among them: Was under great Dejection in my Journey.</P>
<P>On Friday-Morning, I rose early, walk'd about among my People, and inquired into their State and Concerns; and found an additional Weight and Burden on my Spirits, upon hearing some Things disagreeable. I endeavour'd to go to God with my Distresses, and made some kind of lamentable Complaint; and in a broken Manner spread my Difficulties before God; but notwithstanding, my Mind continued very gloomy. About ten o'Clock, I call'd my People together, and after having ex|plain'd and sung a Psalm, I pray'd with them: There was a considerable deal of Affection among them; I doubt not, in some Instances, that which was more than meerly natural.</P>
<P>[This was the <HI>last Interview,</HI> that he ever had with his People. About 11 o'Clock the same Day, he left 'em; and the next Day, came to <HI>Elisabeth-Town</HI>; his Melancholy re|maining still: And he continued for a considerable Time under a great Degree of Dejection thro' vapoury Disorders.]</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>March</HI> 28. Was taken this Morning with violent griping Pains. These Pains were extreme, and constant, for several Hours; so that it seem'd impossible for me, without a Miracle, to live 24 Hours in such Distress. I lay confined to my Bed, the whole Day, and in distressing Pain, all the former Part of it: But it pleased God to bless Means for the abatement of my Distress. Was exceedingly weaken'd by this Pain, and continued so for several Days following; being ex|ercised with a Fever, Cough, and nocturnal Sweats. In this distressed Case so long as my Head was free of vapoury Con|fusions, <HI>Death</HI> appeared agreeable to me; I look'd on it as the End of Toils, and an Entrance into a Place <HI>where the weary are at rest</HI>; and, I think, I had some Relish of the Entertain|ments of the heavenly State; so that by these I was allured and drawn, as well as driven by the Fatigues of Life. Oh, how happy it is, to be drawn by Desires of a State of perfect Holiness!</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>April</HI> 4. Was sunk and dejected, very restless and uneasy, by Reason of the Misimprovement of Time; and yet knew not what to do: I longed to spend Time in Fasting and Prayer, that I might be delivered from Indolence and Coldness
<PB N="219" REF="006311_0252_0000000000000000">
in the Things of God; but alas, I had not bodily Strength for these Exercises! Oh, how blessed a Thing is it, to enjoy Peace of Conscience! But how dreadful is a Want of inward Peace and Composure of Soul! 'Tis impossible, I find, to en|joy this Happiness without <HI>redeeming Time,</HI> and maintaining a spiritual Frame of Mind.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>April</HI> 5. It grieved me, to find my self so in|conceivably barren. My Soul thirsted for Grace: But alas, how far was I from obtaining what I saw so exceeding excellent! I was ready to despair of ever being a holy Creature; and yet my Soul was desirous of <HI>following hard after</HI> GOD; but never did I see my self so far from <HI>having apprehended, or being already perfect,</HI> as at this Time. The Lord's Supper being this Day administred, I attended the Ordinance: And tho' I saw in my self a dreadful Emptiness, and want of Grace, and saw my self as it were at an infinite Distance from that Purity, which is becoming the Gospel; yet in the Season of Communion, espe|cially in the Time of the Distribution of the Bread, I enjoyed some Warmth of Affection, and felt a tender <HI>Love to the Bre|thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI>; and, I think, to the glorious Redeemer, the <HI>First-born</HI> among them. I endeavoured then to <HI>bring forth</HI> mine and <HI>his Enemies, and slay them before him</HI>; and found great Freedom in begging Deliverance from this spiritual Death, as well as in asking divine Favours for my Friends, and Congregation, and the Church of Christ in general.</P>
<P>Tuesay, <HI>April</HI> 7. In the Afternoon, rode to <HI>Newark,</HI> in order to marry the Rev. Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The late learned and very excellent Mr. JONATHAN DICKINSON, Pastor of a Church in <HI>Elisabeth-Town,</HI> Pre|sident of the College of <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> and one of the Corres|pondents of the honourable Society in <HI>Scotland</HI> for propa|gating Christian Knowledge: Who had a great Esteem for Mr. <HI>Brainerd,</HI> and had kindly entertain'd him in his House during his Sickness in the Winter past; and who, after a short Illness, died in the next ensuing <HI>October,</HI> two Days before Mr. <HI>Brainerd.</HI></NOTE>; and in the Evening, performed that Work.

<P>Friday, <HI>April</HI> 10.

<P>Tuesday, <HI>April</HI> 14. Was able to do little or nothing: Spent some Time with Mr. <HI>Byram</HI> and other Friends. This Day my <HI>Brother</HI> went to my People.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>April</HI> 15. Found some Freedom at the Thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of Grace, several Times this Day. In the Afternoon, was very weak, and spent the Time to very little Purpose; and yet in the Evening, had (I thought) some religious Warmth and spi|ritual Desires in Prayer: My Soul seem'd to go forth after God, and take Complacence in his divine Perfections. But alas, afterwards awfully let down my Watch, and grew careless and secure.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>April</HI> 16. Was in bitter Anguish of Soul, in the Morning, such as I have scarce ever felt, with a Sense of Sin and Guilt. I continued in Distress the whole Day, attempting
<PB N="221" REF="006311_0254_0000000000000000">
to pray where-ever I went; and indeed could not help so doing&punc; but look'd upon my self so vile, I dared not look any Body in the Face; and was even grieved, that any Body should show <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> any Respect, or at least, that they should be so deceived as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> think I deserved it.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>April</HI> 17. In the Evening, could not but think, that God helped me to <HI>draw near to the Throne of Grace,</HI> tho' most unworthy, and gave me a Sense of his Favour; which gave me inexpressible Support and Encouragement; tho' I scarcely dared to hope the Mercy was real, it appear'd so great: Yet could not but rejoyce, that ever God should discover his reconciled Face to such a vile Sinner. Shame and Confusion, at Times, cover'd me; and then Hope and Joy and Admiration of divine Goodness gain'd the Ascendant. Sometimes I could not but admire the divine Goodness, that the Lord had not let me fall into all the grossest vilest Acts of Sins and open Scandal, that could be thought of; and felt my self so necessitated to praise God, that this was ready for a little while to swallow up my Shame and Pressure of Spirit on Account of my Sins.</P>
<P>[After this, his Dejection and Pressure of Spirit returned; and he remained under it the two next Days.]</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>April</HI> 20. Was in a very disordered State, and kept my Bed most of the Day. I enjoyed a little more Comfort, than in several of the preceeding Days. This Day I arrived at the Age of 29 Years.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>April</HI> 21. I set out on my Journey for <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> in order (if it might be the Will of God) to recover my Health by riding: Tavelled to <HI>New-York,</HI> and there lodged.</P>
<P>[This proved his final Departure from <HI>New-Jersey.</HI>&mdash; He travelled slowly, and arrived among his Friends at <HI>East-Haddam,</HI> about the beginning of <HI>May.</HI> There is very little Ac|count in his <HI>Diary,</HI> of the Time that pass'd from his setting out on this Journey to <HI>May</HI> 10. He speaks of his sometimes find|ing his Heart rejoicing in the glorious Perfections of God, and longing to live to him; but complains of the Unfixedness of his Tho'ts, and their being easily diverted from divine Subjects, and cries out of his Leanness, as testifying against him, in the loudest Manner. And concerning those <HI>Diversions</HI> he was ob|liged to use for his Health, he says, that he sometimes found he
<PB N="222" REF="006311_0255_0000000000000000">
could use Diversions with <HI>singleness of Heart,</HI> aiming at the Glory of God; but that he also found there was a necessity of great Care and Watchfulness, lest he should lose that spiri|tual Temper of Mind in his Diversion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and lest they should degenerate into wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was meerly selfish, without any supreme Aim at the Glory of God in them.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>May</HI> 10. (At <HI>Had-Lime</HI>) I could not but feel some Measure of Gratitude to God at this Time (wherein I was much exercised) that he had always disposed me, in my Mi|nistry, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o insist on the great Doctrines of <HI>Regeneration, the New-Creature&punc; Faith in Christ, progressive Sanctification, supreme Love to God, living inti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ely to the Glory of God, being not our own,</HI> and the like: God has helped me to see, in the surest Mann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, from Time to Time, that these, and the like Doctrines, necessa|rily connected with them, are the <HI>only Foundation</HI> of Safety and Salvation for perishing Sinners; and that those divine Disposi|tions, which are consonant hereto, are that <HI>Holiness, without which no Man shall see the Lord</HI>: The Exercise of these God-like Tempers, wherein the Soul acts in a kind of Concert with God, and would be and do every Thing that is pleasing to God; This, I saw, would stand by the Soul in a dying Hour; For God must, I think, <HI>deny Himself,</HI> if he cast away <HI>his own Image,</HI> even the Soul that is one in Desires with himself.</P>
<P>Lord's Day, <HI>May</HI> 17. (At <HI>Millington</HI>) Spent the Forenoon at Home, being unable to attend the publick Worship. At this Time, God gave me some affecting Sense of my own Vile|ness, and the exceeding Sinfulness of my Heart; that there seem'd to be Nothing but Sin and Corruption within me. <HI>Innu|merable Evils compass'd me about</HI>; my want of Spirituality and holy living, my neglect of God, and living to my self&mdash; All the Abominations of my Heart and Life seem'd to be open to my View; and I had nothing to say, but, GOD <HI>be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI>&mdash;Towards Noon, I saw, that the Grace of God in Christ is infinitely free towards Sinners, and such Sinners as I was; I also saw, that God is the supream Good, that in his Presence is Life; and I began to long to die, that I might <HI>be with him,</HI> in a State of Freedom from all Sin. Oh, how a small Glimpse of his Excellency refresh'd my Soul! Oh, how worthy i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the blessed God to be loved, adored, and delighted in, for himself, for his own divine Excellencies.</P>
<P>Tho' I felt much Dulness, and want of a Spirit of Prayer, this Week: Yet I had some Glimpses of the Excellency of
<PB N="223" REF="006311_0256_0000000000000000">
divine Things; and especially one Morning, in secret Medita|tion and Prayer, the Excellency and Beauty of Holiness, as a Likeness to the glorious God, was so discovered to me, that I began to long earnestly to be in that World where Holiness dwells in Perfection: And I seem'd to long for this perfect Holiness, not so much for the sake of my own Happiness (altho' I saw clearly that this was the greatest, yea, the only Happiness of the Soul) as that I might please God, live intirely to him, and glorify him to the utmost Stretch of my rational Powers and Capacities.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>May</HI> 24. (At <HI>Long-Meadow</HI> in <HI>Springfield</HI>) Could not but think, as I have often remark'd to others, that much more of <HI>true Religion</HI> consists in <HI>deep Humility, Brokenness of Heart, and an abasing Sense of Barrenness and want of Grace and Holiness,</HI> than most who are called <HI>Christians,</HI> imagine; especially those who have been esteemed the Converts of the <HI>late</HI> Day; many of whom seem to know of no other Religion but elevated <HI>Joys</HI> and <HI>Affections,</HI> arising only from some Flights of <HI>Imagination,</HI> or some <HI>Suggestion</HI> made to their Mind, of <HI>Christ's</HI> being <HI>their's,</HI> God's <HI>loving them,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>[On Thursday, <HI>May</HI> 28. He came from <HI>Long-Meadow</HI> to <HI>Northampton</HI>; appearing vastly better than, by his Account, he had been in the Winter; indeed so well, that he was able to ride 25 Miles in a Day, and to walk half a Mile; and appeared chearful, and free from Melancholy: But yet undoubtedly, at that Time, in a confirmed, incurable Consumption.</P>
<P>I had had much Opportunity, before this, of particular Infor|mation concerning him, from many that were well acquainted with him; and had my self once an Opportunity of considerable Conversation and some Acquaintance with him, at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> near four Years before, in the Time of the <HI>Commencement</HI> when he offered that Confession to the Rector of the College, that has been already mention'd in this History; I being one he was pleased then several Times to consult on that Affair: But now I had Opportunity for a more full Acquaintance with him. I found him remarkably sociable, pleasant, and entertaining in his Conversation; yet solid, savoury, spiritual, and very profitable; appearing me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k, modest, and humble, far from any Stiffness, Moroseness, superstitious Demureness, or affected Singularity in Speech or Behaviour, and seeming to nauseate all such Things. We enjoyed not only the Benefit of his Conversation, but had the Comfort and Advantage of hearing him pray in the Family,
<PB N="224" REF="006311_0257_0000000000000000">
from Time to Time. His Manner of praying was very agre|able; most becoming a Worm of the Dust, and a Disciple of Christ, addressing to an infinitely great and holy God, and Fa|ther of Mercies; not with florid Expressions, or a study'd Elo|quence; not with any intemperate Vehemence, or indecent Boldness; at the greatest Distance from any Appearance of Ostentation, and from every Thing that might look as tho' be meant to recommend himself to those that were about him, or set himself off to their Acceptance; free too from vain Repetitions, without impertinent Excursions, or needless multiplying of Words. He expressed himself with the strictest Propriety, with Weight, and Pungency; and yet what his Lips uttered seem'd to flow from the <HI>fulness of his Heart,</HI> as deeply impressed with a gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t and solemn Sense of our Necessities, Unworthiness, and Depen|dance, and of God's infinite Greatness&punc; Excellency and Suffi|ciency, rather than meerly from a warm and fruitful Brain, pouring out good Expressions. And I know not, that ever I heard him so much as ask a Blessing or return Thanks at Table, but there was something remarkable, to be observed both in the Matter and Manner of the Performance. In his Prayers, he insisted much on the Prosperity of <HI>Zion,</HI> the Advancement of Christ's Kingdom in the World, and the Flourishing and Pro|pagation of Religion among the <HI>Indians.</HI> And he generally made it one Petition in his Prayer, <HI>that we might not out-live our Usefulness.</HI>]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>May</HI> 31. [At <HI>Northampton,</HI>] I had little inward Sweetness in Religion, most of the Week past; not realising and beholding spiritually the <HI>Glory of God, and the blessed Redeemer</HI>; from whence always arise <HI>my Comforts and Joys</HI> in Religion, if I have any at all: And if I can't so behold the Excellencies and Perfections of God, as to cause me to rejoyce in him for what he is <HI>in himself,</HI> I have no solid Foundation for Joy. To rejoyce, only because I apprehend I have an <HI>Interest in Christ,</HI> and shall be finally saved, is a poor mean Business indeed.</P>
<P>[This Week, he consulted Dr. <HI>Mather,</HI> at my House, con|cerning his Illness; who plainly told him, that there were great Evidences of his being in a confirmed <HI>Consumption,</HI> and that he could give him no Encouragement, that he should ever re|cover. But it seemed not to occasion the least Discomposure in him, nor to make any Manner of Alteration as to the Chear|fulness and Serenity of his Mind, or the Freedom or Pleasant|ness of his Conversation.]</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="006311_0258_0000000000000000">Lord's-Day, <HI>June</HI> 7. My Attention was greatly engaged, and my Soul so drawn forth, this Day, by what I heard of the <HI>exceeding Preciousness of the saving Grace of God's Spirit,</HI> that it almost overcame my Body, in my weak State: I saw, that true Grace is exceeding precious indeed; that it is very rare; and that there is but a very small Degree of it, even where the Reality of it is to be found; at least, I saw this to be <HI>my</HI> Case.</P>
<P>In the preceeding Week, I enjoyed some comfortable Seasons of Meditation. One Morning, the Cause of God appear'd exceeding precious to me: The Redeemer's Kingdom is all that is valuable in the Earth, and I could not but long for the Pro|motion of it in the World: I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aw also, that this Cause is God's, that he has an infinitely greater Regard and Conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rn for it, than I could possibly have; that if I have any true Love to this blessed Interest, it is only a Drop derived from that Ocean. Hence, I was ready to <HI>lift up my Head with Joy</HI>; and conclude, <HI>Well, if God's Cause be so dear and precious to him, he will pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nts it.</HI> And thus I did as it were rest on God, that surely he would promote that which was so agreable to his own Will; tho' the Time, when, must still be left to his sovereign Pleasure.</P>
<P>[He was advised by Physicians still to continue Riding, as what would tend, above any other Means, to prolong his Life. He was at a Loss, for some Time, which Way to bend his Course next; but finally determined to ride from hence to <HI>Boston</HI>; we having concluded that One of this Family should go with him, and be helpful to him in his weak and low State.]</P>
<P>Tuesday, <HI>June</HI> 9. I set out on a Journey from <HI>Northampton</HI> to <HI>Boston</HI>: Travelled slowly, and got some Acquaintance with divers Ministers on the Road.</P>
<P>I having now continued to ride for some considerable Time together, felt my self much better than I had formerly done; and I found, that in Proportion to the Prospect I had of being restored to a State of Usefulness, so I desired the Continuance of Life: But <HI>Death</HI> appear'd inconceivably more desirable to me, than a <HI>useless Life</HI>; yet blessed be God, I found my Heart, at Times, fully resigned and reconciled to this greatest of Af|flictions, if God saw fit thus to deal with me.</P>
<P>Friday, <HI>July</HI> 12. I arrived in <HI>Boston</HI> this Day, somewhat fa|tigued with my Journey. Observed, that there is no <HI>Rest,</HI> but in GOD: Fatigues of Body, and Anxieties of Mind attend us, both in Town and Country; no Place is exempted.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="006311_0259_0000000000000000">Lord's-Day, <HI>June</HI> 14. I enjoyed some Enlargement &amp; Sweet|ness in Family-Prayer, as well as in secret Exercises; God ap|pear'd excellent, his Ways full of Pleasure and Peace, and all I wanted was a Spirit of holy Fervency, to live to him.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>June</HI> 17. This, and the two preceeding Days, I spent mainly in visiting the Ministers of the Town, and was treated with great Respect by them.</P>
<P>On Thursday, <HI>June</HI> 18. I was taking exceeding ill, and bro't to the Gates of Death, by the breaking of small Ulcers in my Lungs, as my Physician supposed. In this extreme weak State I conti|nued for several Weeks, and was frequently reduced so low, as to be utterly Speechless, and not able so much as to whisper a Word; and even after I had so far revived, as to walk about House, and to step out of Doors, I was exercised every Day with a faint Turn, which continued usually four or five Hours; at which Times, tho' I was not utterly Speechless, so but that I could say <HI>Yes</HI> or <HI>No,</HI> yet I could not converse at all, nor speak one Sentence without making Stops for Breath; and diverse Times in this Season, my Friends gathered round my Bed, to see me breathe my last, which they look'd for every Moment, as I my self also did.</P>
<P>How I was, the first Day or two of my illness, with Regard to the Exercise of <HI>Reason,</HI> I scarcely know; but I believe I was something shatter'd with the Violence of the Fever, at Times: But the third Day of my Illness, and constantly afterwards, for four or five Weeks together, I enjoyed as much Serenity of Mind, and Clearness of Thought, as perhaps I ever did in my Life; and I think, my Mind never penetrated with so much Ease and Freedom into divine Things, as at this Time; and I never fel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> so capable of demonstrating the Truth of many im|portant Doctrines of the Gospel as now. And as I saw clearly the <HI>Truth</HI> of those great Doctrines, which are justly stiled the DOCTRINES of GRACE; so I saw with no less Clearness, that the <HI>Essence</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> consisted in the Soul's <HI>Conformity to</HI> GOD, and acting above all selfish Views, for <HI>his Glory,</HI> longing to be <HI>for him,</HI> to live <HI>to him,</HI> and please and honour <HI>him</HI> in all Things; and this from a clear View of his infinite Excellency and Worthiness <HI>in himself,</HI> to be loved, adored, worshipped, and served by all intelligent Creatures. Thus I saw, that when a Soul <HI>loves</HI> God with a supreme Love, he therein acts <HI>like</HI> the blessed God himself, who most Justly loves himself in that Manner: So when God's Interest and his are become one, and he longs that God should be <HI>glorified,</HI> and rejoyces to think that he is
<PB N="227" REF="006311_0260_0000000000000000">
unchangeably possess'd of the highest Glory and Blessedness, herein also he acts in <HI>Conformity</HI> to God: In like Manner, when the Soul is fully <HI>resigned to,</HI> and rests satisfied and contented <HI>with</HI> the divine Will, here it is also <HI>conformed</HI> to God.</P>
<P>I saw further, that as this divine Temper, whereby the Soul exalts God, and treads Self in the Dust, is wrought in the Soul by God's discovering his own glorious Perfections <HI>in the Face of Jesus Christ</HI> to it, by the special Influences of the holy Spirit, so he cannot but have <HI>Regard to it,</HI> as his own Work; and as it is his Image in the Soul, he cannot but take <HI>Delight</HI> in it. Then I saw again, that if God should slight and reject his own moral <HI>Image,</HI> he must needs <HI>deny himself</HI>; which he cannot do. And thus I saw the <HI>Stability</HI> and <HI>Infallibility</HI> of this Religion, and that those who are truly possess'd of it, have the most compleat and satisfying <HI>Evidence</HI> of their being interested in all the Be|nefits of Christ's Redemption, having their Hearts <HI>conformed to him</HI>; and that these and these only are qualified for the Employ|ments and Entertainments of God's Kingdom of Glory; as none but these have any Relish for the Business of Heaven, which is to ascribe Glory to God, and not to themselves; and that God (tho' I would speak it with great Reverence of his Name and Perfections) cannot, without denying himself, finally cast such away.</P>
<P>The next Thing I had then to do, was to enquire, whether <HI>this</HI> was <HI>my</HI> Religion: And here God was pleased to help me to the most easy Remembrance and critical Review of what had pass'd in Course, of a religious Nature, thro' several of the lat|ter Years of my Life: And altho' I could discover much Cor|ruption attending my best Duties, many selfish Views and car|nal Ends, much spiritual Pride and Self-Exaltation&punc; and in|numerable other Evils which compass'd me about; I say, altho' I now discerned the Sins of my holy Things, as well as other Actions, yet God was pleased, as I was reviewing, quickly to put this Question out of Doubt, by shewing me, that I had, from Time to Time, acted above the utmost Influence of meer Self-Love; that I had longed to please and glorify him, as my highest Happiness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And this Review was thro' Grace attended with a present Feeling of the same divine Temper of Mind; I felt now pleased, to think of the Glory of God, and longed for Heaven, as a State wherein I might glorify God perfectly, ra|ther than a Place of Happiness for my self: And this Feeling of the Love of God in my Heart, which I trust the Spirit of God excited in me afresh, was sufficient to give me full Satisfaction,
<PB N="228" REF="006311_0261_0000000000000000">
and make me long, as I had many Times before done, to be with Christ: I did not now want any of the <HI>sudden Suggestions,</HI> which many are so pleased with, <HI>That Christ and his Benefits are</HI> MINE, <HI>That God loves</HI> ME, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in order to give me Satisfaction about my State: No, my Soul now abhor'd those Delusions of <HI>Satan,</HI> which are thought to be the <HI>immediate Witness of the Spirit,</HI> while there is nothing but an <HI>empty Suggestion</HI> of a certain Fact, without any gracious Discovery of the <HI>divine Glory,</HI> or of the <HI>Spirit's Work</HI> in their own Hearts: I saw the awful Delusion of this Kind of Confidences, as well as of the whole of <HI>that</HI> Religion, which they usually spring from, or at least are the Attendants of; the <HI>false</HI> Religion of the late Day (tho' a Day of wondrous Grace) the <HI>Imaginations,</HI> and Impressions made only on the <HI>animal</HI> Affections, together with the <HI>sudden</HI> Suggestions, made to the Mind by <HI>Satan, transformed into an Angel of Light,</HI> of certain Facts not revealed in Scripture: These, and many like Things, I fear, have made up the greater Part of the religious Appear|ance in many Places.</P>
<P>These Things I saw with great Clearness, when I was tho't to be dying. And God gave me great Concern for his Church and Interest in the World, at this Time: Not so much because the late remarkable Influence upon the Minds of People was abated, and almost wholly gone, as because that false Religion, those Heats of Imagination, and wild and selfish Commotions of the animal Affections, which attended the Work of Grace, had prevailed so far. <HI>This</HI> was that which my Mind dwelt up|on, almost Day and Night: And <HI>this,</HI> to me, was the darkest Appearance, respecting Religion, in the Land; for 'twas <HI>this</HI> chiefly, that had prejudiced the World against inward Religion. And I saw, the great Misery of all was, that so few saw any Man|ner of <HI>Difference</HI> between those Exercises that were spiritual and holy, and those which have <HI>Self-Love</HI> only for their Beginning, Center, and End.</P>
<P>As God was pleased to afford me Clearness of Thought, and Composure of Mind, almost continually, for several Weeks together, under my great Weakness; so he enabled me, in some Measure, to improve my Time (as I hope) to valuable Pur|poses. I was enabled to write a Number of important <HI>Letters,</HI> to Friends in remote Places <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among these are the eighth, ninth, and tenth Letters, at the End of this History.</NOTE>: And sometimes I wrote when
<PB N="229" REF="006311_0262_0000000000000000">
I was Speechless; i. e. unable to maintain Conversation with any Body; tho' perhaps I was able to speak a Word or two so as to be heard.&mdash; At this Season also, while I was confined at <HI>Boston,</HI> I read with Care and Attention some Papers of old Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI>'s, lately come to Light, and designed for the Press: And as I was desired, and greatly urged, made some Corrections, where the Sense was left dark, for want of a Word or two.&mdash; Besides this, I had many <HI>Visitants</HI>; with whom, when I was able to speak, I always conversed of the Things of Religion; and was peculiarly disposed and assisted in distinguishing between the <HI>true</HI> and <HI>false</HI> Religion of the Times: There was scarce any Subject, that has been Matter of Debate in the late Day, but what I was at one Time or other brought to a Sort of Necessity to discourse upon, and shew my Opinion in; and that frequently before Numbers of People; and especially, I discoursed repeatedly on the Nature and Necessity of that <HI>Humiliation, Self-Emptiness,</HI> or full Conviction of a Person's being utterly undone in himself, which is necessary in order to a saving <HI>Faith,</HI> and the extreme <HI>Difficulty</HI> of being brought to this, and the great Danger there is of Persons taking up with some <HI>Self-righteous Appearances</HI> of it: The <HI>Danger</HI> of this I especially dwelt upon, being perswaded that Multitudes perish in this hidden Way; and because so little is said from most Pulpits to discover any Danger here: So that Persons being never effectually brought to die in themselves&punc; are never truly united to Christ, and so perish. I also discoursed much on what I take to be the Essence of true Religion, endea|vouring plainly to describe that God-like Temper and Disposi|tion of Soul, and that holy Conversation and Behaviour, that may justly claim the Honour of having God for its Original and Patron. And I have Reason to hope God blessed my Way of discoursing and distinguishing, to some, both Ministers and People; so that my Time was not wholly lost.</P>

Passage in his Diary) and there discharging and diffusing their purulent Matter; which, while Nature was labouring and struggling to thro' off (that could be done no otherwise, than by a gradual straining of it thro' the small Vessels of those vital Parts) This occasion'd an high Fever, and violent Cough|ing, and threw the whole Frame of Nature into the utmost Disorder, and brought it near to a Dissolution. But supposed, if the Strength of Nature held 'till the Lungs had this Way gra|dually cleared themselves of this putid Matter, he might revive, and continue better, 'till new Ulcers gathered and broke; but then would surely sink again; and that there was no Hope of his Recovery; but (as he expressed himself to one of my Neigh|bours, who at that Time saw him in <HI>Boston</HI>) he was as certainly a dead Man, as if he was shot through the Heart.</P>
<P>But so it was ordered in divine Providence, that the Strength of Nature held out through this great Conflict, so as just to escape the Grave at that Turn; and then he revived, to the Astonishment of all that knew his Case.</P>
<P>After he began to revive, he was visited by his youngest Bro|ther, Mr. <HI>Israel Brainerd,</HI> a Student at <HI>Yale-College</HI>; who hav|ing heard of his extreme Illness, went from thence to <HI>Boston,</HI> in order to see him, if he might find him alive, which he but little expected.</P>
<P>This Visit was attended with a mixture of Joy and Sorrow to Mr. <HI>Brainerd.</HI> He greatly rejoyced to see his Brother, especially because he had desired an Opportunity of some religious Conver|sation with him before he died. But this Meeting was attended with Sorrow, as his Brother brought to him the sorrowful Tidings of his Sister <HI>Spencer</HI>'s Death at <HI>Haddam</HI>; a Sister, between whom and him had long subsisted a peculiarly dear Affection, and much Intimacy in spiritual Matters, and whose House he used to make his Home, when he went to <HI>Haddam,</HI> his native Place.

<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>July</HI> 19. I was just able to attend publick Wor|ship, being carried to the House of God in a Chaise. Heard Dr. <HI>Sewall</HI> preach, in the Forenoon: Partook of the Lord's-Supper

He did it in a long Conference he had with a Gentleman, that has very pub|lickly and strenuously appear'd to defend that Tenet. He had this Discourse with him in the Presence of a Number of consi|derable Persons, who came to visit Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> before he left the Town, and to take their Leave of him. In which Debate, he made this plain Declaration (at the same Time confirming what he said, by many Arguments) That the <HI>Essence</HI> of saving <HI>Faith</HI> was wholly left out of that <HI>Definition</HI> of saving Faith which that Gentleman has published; and that the Faith which he had <HI>defined,</HI> had nothing of GOD in it, nothing above Na|ture, nor indeed above the Power of the Devils; and that all such as had <HI>this</HI> Faith, and had <HI>no better,</HI> tho' they might have this to never so high a Degree, would surely perish. And he declar'd also, that he never had greater <HI>Assurance</HI> of the <HI>False|ness</HI> of the Principles of those that maintained <HI>such</HI> a Faith, and of their dangerous and destructive Tendency, or a more affect|ing Sense of the great Delusion and Misery of those that de|pended on getting to Heaven by <HI>such</HI> a Faith (while they had <HI>no better</HI>) than he lately had when he was supposed to be at the Point to <HI>die,</HI> and expected every Minute to pass into <HI>Eternity.</HI>&mdash;Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Discourse at this Time, and the forceable Reasonings, by which he confirmed what he asserted, appear'd to be greatly to the Satisfaction of those present; as several of them took Oc|casion expresly to manifest to him, before they took Leave of him.</P>

<P>On Wednesday-Morning, the Week after he came to <HI>North|ampton,</HI> he took Leave of his Brother <HI>Israel,</HI> and never expecting to see him again in this World&punc; he now setting out from hence on his Journey to <HI>New-Haven.</HI></P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> came hither, he had so much Strength as to be able, from Day to Day, to ride out two or three Miles, and to return&punc; and sometimes to pray in the Family; but from this Time he gradually, but sensibly, decayed, &amp; became weak|er and weak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="006311_0268_0000000000000000">While he was here, his Conversation from first to last was much on the same Subjects as it had been when in <HI>Boston:</HI> He was much in speaking of the Nature of <HI>true Religion</HI> of Heart and Practice, as distinguished from it's various <HI>Counterfeits</HI>; expressing his great Concern, that the latter did so much prevail in many Places. He often manifested his great Abhorrence of all such <HI>Doctrines</HI> and <HI>Principles</HI> in Religion, as in any wise fa|voured of, and had any (tho' but a remote) Tendency to <HI>Au|tinomianism</HI>; of all such Notions, as seem'd to diminish the Ne|cessity of Holiness of Life, or to abate Men's Regard to the Com|mands of God, and a strict diligent and universal Practice of Vertue and Piety, under a Pretence of depreciating our Works, and magnifying God's free Grace. He spake often, with much Detestation, of such <HI>Experiences</HI> and pretended <HI>Discoveries</HI> and <HI>Joys,</HI> as have nothing of the Nature of <HI>Sanctification</HI> in them, and don't tend to Strictness, Tenderness, and Diligence in Reli|gion, and Meekness and Benevolence towards Mankind, and an humble Behaviour: And he also declared, that he looked on such pretended <HI>Humility</HI> as worthy of no Regard, that was not manifested by <HI>Modesty</HI> of <HI>Conduct</HI> and <HI>Conversation.</HI> He spake often, with Abhorrence, of the Spirit and Practice that appears among the greater Part of <HI>Separatists</HI> at this Day in the Land, particularly, those in the eastern Parts of <HI>Connecticut</HI>; in their condemning &amp; separating from the <HI>standing</HI> Ministry &amp; Churches, their crying down <HI>Learning</HI> and a <HI>Learned</HI> Ministry, their Notion of an <HI>immediate Call</HI> to the Work of the Ministry, and the Forward|ness of <HI>Lay men</HI> to set up themselves as publick Teachers. He had been much conversant in the Eastern Part of <HI>Connecticut</HI> (his native Place being near to it) when the same Principles, Noti|on and Spirit began to operate, which have since prevailed to a greater Height; and had Acquaintance with some of those Per|sons who are become Heads and Leaders of the <HI>Separatists</HI>; he had also been conversant with Persons of the same Way elsewhere: And I heeard him say, once and again, he knew by his Acquain|tance with this Sort of People, that what was chiefly and most generally in Repute among <HI>them</HI> as the <HI>Power of Godliness,</HI> was an intirely <HI>different</HI> Thing from that true vital Piety recommended in the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and had <HI>nothing in it</HI> of that Nature. He ma|nifested a great Dislike of a Disposition in Persons to much <HI>Noise</HI> and <HI>Show</HI> in Religion, and affecting to be abundant in proclaim|ing and publishing their own <HI>Experience<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>: Tho' at the same Time he did not condemn, but approved of Christians speak|ing of their own Experiences on some Occasions, and to some
<PB N="236" REF="006311_0269_0000000000000000">
sons, with due Modesty and Discretion. He <HI>himself</HI> sometimes, while at my House, spake of his own Experiences: But it was always with apparent <HI>Reserve,</HI> and in the Exercise of Care and Judgment with Respect to Occasions, Persons, and Circumstan|ces. He mention'd some remarkable Things of his own religi|ous Experience to two young Gentlemen, Candidates for the Ministry, who watched with him (each at a different Time) when he was very low and not far from his End; But he desired both of them not to speak of what he had told them 'till <HI>after his Death.</HI></P>
<P>The Things which were the Subject of that Debate I men|tioned before, that he had with a certain Gentleman&punc; the Day he left <HI>Boston,</HI> seem'd to lie with much Weight on his Mind after he came hither; and he began to write a <HI>Letter</HI> to that Gentleman; expressing his Sentiments concerning the dange|rous Tendency of some of the Tenets he had expressed in Con|versation, and in the Writings he had published; with the Con|siderations by which the exceeding hurtful Nature of those No|tions is evident; but he had not Strength to finish his Letter.</P>
<P>After he came hither, as long as he lived, he was much in speaking of that future Prosperity of <HI>Zion</HI> that is so often fore|told and promised in the Scripture: It was a Theme he delight|ed to dwell upon; and his Mind seem'd to be carried forth with earnest Concern about it, and intense Desires, that Reli|gion might speedily and abundantly revive and flourish; tho' he had not the least Expectation of Recovery; yea, the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rer Death advanced, and the more the Symptoms of it's Approach increased, still the more did his Mind seem to be taken up with this Subject. He told me, when near his End, that
<Q>he ne|ver in all his Life had his Mind so led forth in Desires and earnest Prayers for the flourishing of CHRIST'S <HI>Kingdom</HI> on Earth, as since he was brought so exceeding low at <HI>Boston.</HI></Q>
He seem'd much to wonder, that there appear'd no more of a Disposition in Ministers and People to pray for the flourishing of Religion thro' the World; that so little a Part of their <HI>Pray|ers</HI> was generally taken up about it, in their Families, and else|where; and particularly, he several Times expressed his Won|der, that there appear'd no more Forwardness to comply with the <HI>Proposal</HI> lately made, in a Memoral from a Number of Mi|nisters in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and sent over into <HI>America,</HI> for <HI>united extraor|dinary Prayer,</HI> among Christ's Ministers and People, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">&punc; And he sent it as his dying Advice
<PB N="237" REF="006311_0270_0000000000000000">
to <HI>his own Congregation,</HI> that they should practise agreably to that Proposal.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">His Congregation, since this, have with great Chearfulness and Unanimity fallen in with this Advice, and have practi|sed agreably to the Proposal from <HI>Scotland</HI>; and have at Times appeared with uncommon Engagedness and Fer|vency of Spirit in their Meetings and united Devotions, pursuant to that Proposal: Also the Presbyteries of <HI>New-York,</HI> and <HI>New-Brunswick,</HI> since this, have with one Con|sent, fallen in with the Proposal, as likewise some others of God's People in those Parts.</NOTE></P>
<P>Tho' he was constantly exceeding weak, yet there appear'd in him a continual Care well to improve <HI>Time,</HI> and fill it up with something that might be profitable, and in some Respect for the Glory of God or the Good of Men; either profitable Conver|sation, or writing Letters to absent Friends, or noting something in his Diary, or looking over his former Writings, correcting them, and preparing them to be left in the Hands of others at his Death, or giving some Directions concerning a future Con|ducting and Management of his People, or Employment in secret Devotions. He seem'd never to be easy, however Ill, if he was not doing something for God, or in his Service.</P>
<P>After he came hither, he wrote a <HI>Preface</HI> to a <HI>Diary</HI> of the famous Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI>'s (in those Papers before-mention'd, lately found) having been much urged to it by those Gentlemen in <HI>Boston</HI> who had the Care of the Publication: Which Diary, with his <HI>Preface,</HI> has since been published.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A Part of this <HI>Preface</HI> is inserted in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to this History.</NOTE></P>
<P>In his Diary for Lord's-Day, <HI>August</HI> 9. He speaks of longing Desires after <HI>Death,</HI> thro' a Sense of the Excellency of a State of <HI>Perfection.</HI></P>
<P>In his Diary for Lord's-Day <HI>Aug.</HI> 16. He speaks of his having so much Refreshment of <HI>Soul</HI> in the House of God, that it seem'd also to refresh his <HI>Body.</HI> And this is not only noted in his Diary, but was very observable to others; it was very ap|parent, not only, that his <HI>Mind</HI> was exhilerated with inward Consolation, but also that his <HI>animal</HI> Spirits and <HI>bodily</HI> Strength seemed to be remarkably restored, as tho' he had forgot his Illness. &mdash; But this was the last Time that ever he attended publick Worship on the Sabbath.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="006311_0271_0000000000000000">On Tuesday-Morning that Week (I being absent on a Jour|ney) he prayed with my Family; but not without much Difficulty, for want of bodily Strength: And this was the last Family-Prayer that ever he made.</P>
<P>He had been wont, 'till now, frequently to ride out, two or three Miles; But this Week, on Thursday, was the last Time he ever did so]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Aug.</HI> 23. This Morning, I was considerably refresh'd with the Thought, yea, the Hope and Expectation of the <HI>Enlargement</HI> of CHRIST'S <HI>Kingdom</HI>; and I could not but hope, the Time was at Hand, when <HI>Babylon</HI> the great would <HI>fall,</HI> and <HI>rise no more:</HI> This led me to some spiritual Meditations, that were very refreshing to me. I was unable to attend pub|lick Worship, either Part of the Day; but God was pleased to afford me Fixedness and Satisfaction in divine Thoughts. No|thing so refreshes my Soul, as when I can <HI>go to</HI> GOD, yea, <HI>to</HI> GOD <HI>my exceeding Joy.</HI> When he is so, sensibly, to my Soul, Oh, how unspeakably delightful is this!</P>
<P>In the Week past, I had divers Turns of inward Refreshing; tho' my Body was inexpressibly weak, followed con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ually with Agues and Fevers. Sometimes my Soul center'd in GOD, as my only <HI>Portion</HI>; and I felt that I should be forever unhappy, if <HI>he</HI> did not <HI>reign</HI>: I saw the Sweetness and Happiness of being <HI>his</HI> Subject, at <HI>his</HI> Disposal: This made all my Difficulties quickly vanish.</P>
<P>From this Lord's Day, <HI>vix. Aug.</HI> 23. I was troubled very much with vapoury Disorders, and could neither write nor read, and could scarcely live; altho' thro' Mercy, was not so much oppress'd with heavy Melancholy and Gloominess, as at many other Times.</P>
<P>['Till this Week he had been wont to lodge in a Room above Stairs; but he now grew so weak, that he was no longer able to go up Stairs and down; Friday <HI>Aug.</HI> 28. was the last Time he ever went above Stairs, henceforward be betook him|self to a lower Room.</P>
<P>On Wednesday, <HI>September</HI> 2. Being the Day of our publick Lecture, he seem'd to be refresh'd with seeing the Neighbouring Ministers that came hither to the Lecture, and express'd a great Desire once more to go to the House of God on that Day: And accordingly rode to the Meeting&punc; and attended divine Service, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Rev.

that he supposed it to be the last Time that ever he should at|tend the publick Worship; as it proved. And indeed it was the last Time that ever he went out at our Gate alive.</P>
<P>On the Saturday-Evening next following, he was unexpect|edly visited by his Brother Mr. <HI>John Brainerd,</HI> who came to see him from <HI>New-Jersey.</HI> He was much refresh'd by this unex|pected Visit, this Brother being peculiarly dear to him; and he seem'd to rejoyce in a devout and solemn Manner, to see him, and to hear the comfortable Tidings he brought concerning the State of his dear Congregation of Christian <HI>Indians</HI>: And a Cir|cumstance of this Visit, that he was exceeding glad of, was, that his Brother brought him some of his private Writings from <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> and particularly his Diary that he had kept for many Years past.]</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Sept.</HI> 6. I began to read some of my private Writings, which my Brother brought me; and was considera|bly refresh'd, with what I met with in them.</P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 7. I proceeded further in reading my old pri|vate Writings, and found they had the same Effect upon me as before: I could not but rejoyce and bless God for what passed long ago, which without Writing had been entirely lost.</P>
<P>This Evening, when I was in great Distress of Body, my Soul long'd that God should be glorified: I saw there was no Hea|ven but this. I could not but speak to the By-standers then of the only <HI>Happiness,</HI> viz. <HI>Pleasing</HI> GOD. Oh that I could for ever live to God! The Day, I trust, is at Hand, the perfect Day: Oh, the Day of Deliverance from all Sin!</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Sept.</HI> 13. I was much refresh'd and engaged in Meditation and Writing, and found a Heart to act for God. My Spirits were refreshed, and my Soul delighted to do some|thing for God.</P>
<P>[On the Evening following that Lord's Day, his Feet began to appear sensibly swell'd; which thenceforward swell'd more and more. A Symptom of his Dissolution coming on.</P>
<P>The next Day, his Brother <HI>John</HI> left him, being obliged to return to <HI>New-Jersey</HI> on some Business of great Importance and Necessity; intending to return again with all possible Speed, hoping to see his Brrother yet once more in the Land of the Living.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Brainerd</HI> having now with much Deliberation consider|ed of the important Affair fore-mentioned, left with him by the

honourable Commissioners in <HI>Boston,</HI> of the Corporation in <HI>Lon|don</HI> for the Propagation of the Gospel in <HI>New-England</HI> and Parts adjacent, <HI>viz.</HI> the fixing upon and recommending two Persons proper to be improved as Missionaries to the <HI>Six Na|tions,</HI> he about this Time wrote a Letter, recommending two young Gentlemen of his Acquaintance to those Commissioners, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Elihu Spencer</HI> of <HI>East-Haddam,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Job Strong</HI> of <HI>Northampton.</HI> The Commissioners on the Receipt of this Let|ter, cheerfully &amp; unanimously agreed to accept of and employ the Persons he had recommended: Who accordingly have since waited on the Commissioners to receive their Instructions; and pursuant to their Instructions, have applied themselves to a Pre|paration for the Business of their Mission, in the Manner to which they directed them; and one of them, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Spencer,</HI> has been solemnly ordained to that Work, by several of the Mi|nisters of <HI>Boston,</HI> in the Presence of an Ecclesiastical Council convened for that Purpose; and is now gone forth to the Nation of the <HI>Oncid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s,</HI> about 170 Miles beyond <HI>Albany.</HI></P>
<P>He also this Week, <HI>viz.</HI> on Wednesday, <HI>Septemb.</HI> 16. wrote a Letter to a particular Gentleman in <HI>Boston</HI> (one of those charitable Persons foremention'd, who appear'd so forward to contribute of their Substance for the promoting Christianity a|mong the <HI>Indians</HI>) relating to the Growth of the <HI>Indian</HI> School, and the Need of another School-Master or some Person to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the School-Master in instructing the <HI>Indian</HI> Children. These Gentlemen, on the Receipt of this Letter, had a Meeting, and agreed with great Chearfulness to give 200 Pounds (in Bills, of the old Tenor) for the Support of another School-Master; and desired the Rev. Mr. <HI>Pemberton</HI> of <HI>New-York</HI> (who was then at <HI>Boston,</HI> and was also, at their Desire, present at their Meet|ing) as soon as possible to procure a suitable Person for that Ser|vice; and also agreed to allow 75 Pounds to defrey some spe|cial Charges, that were requisite to encourage the Mission to the <HI>Six Nations</HI> (besides the Salary allowed by the Commissio|ners) which was also done on some Intimations given by Mr. <HI>Brainerd.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> spent himself much in writing those Letters, being exceeding weak: But it seem'd to be much to his Satis|faction, that he had been enabled to do it; hoping that it was something done for GOD, and which might be for the advance|ment of CHRIST'S Kingdom and Glory. In writing the last of these Letters, he was obliged to use the Hand of another, not being able to write himself.</P>

He often used the Epithet, <HI>glorious,</HI> when speaking of the Day of his <HI>Death,</HI> calling it <HI>that glorious Day.</HI> And as he saw his Dissolution gradually approaching, he was much in talking about it, with perfect Calmness speaking of a future State; and also settling all his Affairs, very particularly and minutely giving Directions concerning what he would have done in one Respect and another after he was dead. And the nearer Death approached, the more desirous he seem'd to be of it. He several Times spake of the different Kinds of <HI>Wil|lingness to die</HI>; and spoke of it as an ignoble mean Kind of Wil|lingness to die, to be willing to leave the Body, only to get rid of Pain; or to go to Heaven, only to get Honour and Advance|ment there.]</P>

<Q><HI>My Heaven</HI> is to <HI>please</HI> GOD, and <HI>glorify</HI> him, and to give all to him, and to be wholly devoted to his Glory; that is the Heaven I long for; that is my <HI>Religion,</HI> and that is my <HI>Happiness</HI>; and always was ever since I suppose I had any true Religion; and all those that are of <HI>that</HI> Re|ligion shall meet <HI>me</HI> in Heaven.&mdash; I don't go to Heaven to be advanced, but to give Honour to God.

<P>He intermingled with these and other like Expressions, many pathetical <HI>Counsels</HI> to those that were about him; particularly to my Children and Servants. He applied himself to some of my younger Children at this Time; calling them to him, and speaking to 'em one by one; setting before them, in a very plain Manner, the Nature and Essence of true Piety, and its great Importance and Necessity; earnestly warning them not to rest in any Thing short of that true and thorough Change of Heart, and a Life devoted to God; counselling them not to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lack in the great Business of Religion, nor in the least to delay it; enforcing his Counsels with this, that his Words were the Words of a <HI>dying Man</HI>: Said he,
<Q>I shall die here, and here I shall be buried, and here you will see my Grave, and do you remember what I have said to you. I am going into Eternity: And 'tis sweet to me to think of Eternity; the Endlesness of it makes it sweet: But Oh, what shall I say to the Eter|nity of the <HI>Wicked!</HI> I can't mention it, nor think of it: The Thought is too dreadful. When you see my Grave, then remember what I said to you while I was alive: then think with your self, how that Man, that lies in that Grave, coun|sell'd and warned me to prepare for Death.</Q></P>
<P>His <HI>Body</HI> seemed to be marvellously strengthen'd, through the inward Vigour and Refreshment of his <HI>Mind</HI>; so that, altho' before he was so weak that he could hardly utter a Sentence, yet now he continued his most affecting &amp; profitable Discourse to us for more than an Hour, with scarce any Intermission; and said of it, when he had done, <HI>it was the last Sermon that ever he should preach.</HI></P>

Among many other Expres|sions, he said thus;
<Q>When Ministers feel these special gra|cious Influences on their Hearts, it wonderfully assists them to come at the Consciences of Men, and as it were to handle them with Hands; whereas, without them, whatever Reason and Oratory we make use of, we do but make use of <HI>Stamps,</HI> instead of Hands.</Q></P>
<P>Monday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 21. I began to correct a little Volume of my private Writings: GOD, I believe, remarkably helped me in it; my Strength was surprizingly lengthen'd out, and my Thoughts quick and lively, and my Soul refresh'd, hoping it might be a Work for GOD. Oh, how good, how sweet it is, to labour for GOD!</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="006311_0278_0000000000000000">Tuesday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 22. Was again employed in reading and correcting, and had the same Success, as the Day before. I was exceeding weak; but it seem'd to refresh my Soul, thus to spend Time.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 23. I finish'd my Corrections of the little Piece formention'd, and felt uncommonly peaceful: It seem'd as if I had now done all my Work in this World, and stood ready for my Call to a better. As long as I see any Thing to be done for GOD, Life is worth having: But Oh, how vain and unwor|thy 'tis, to live for any lower End!&mdash;This Day, I indited a Letter, I think, of great Importance, to the Rev.

But blessed be God, I have enjoyed considerable Sweetness in divine Things, this Week, both by Night and Day.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 24. My Strength began to fail exceedingly; which look'd further as if I had done all my Work: However I had Strength to fold and superscribe my Letter. About two I went to Bed, being weak and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and lay in a burning Fever 'till Night, without any proper Rest. In the Evening, I got up, having lain down in some of my Cloaths; but was in the greatest Distress, that ever I endured, having an un|common Kind of Hiccough; which either strangled me, or threw me into a Straining to vomit; and at the same Time was distress'd with griping Pains. Oh, the Distress of this Evening! I had little Expectation of my living the Night through, nor indeed had any about me: and I longed for the <HI>finishing</HI> Mo|ment!&mdash; I was obliged to repair to Bed by 6 o'Clock; and thro' Mercy enjoyed some Rest; but was grievously dis|tress'd at Turns with the Hiccough.&mdash; My Soul breath'd after GOD, while the Watcher was with me: &mdash; <HI>When shall I come to God, even to God, my exceeding Joy?

<P>Friday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 25. This Day, I was unspeakably weak, and little better than Speechless all the Day: However, I was able

to write a little, and felt comfortably in some Part of the Day.

<P>Saturday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 26. I felt the Sweetness of divine Things, this Forenoon; and had the Consolation of a Consciousness that I was doing something for God.</P>
<P>Lord's-Day, <HI>Sept.</HI> 27. This was a very comfortable Day to my Soul; I think, <HI>I aw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke with God.</HI> I was enabled to <HI>lift up my Soul to God,</HI> early this Morning; and while I had little bodily Strength, I found Freedom to lift up my Heart to God for my self and others. Afterwards, was pleased with the Thoughts of speedily entring into the unseen World.</P>
<P>[Early this Morning, as one of the Family came into the Room, he express'd himself thus: <HI>I have had more</HI> Pleasure <HI>this Morning, than all the</HI> Drunkards <HI>in the World enjoy, if it were all extracted!</HI>&mdash; So much did he esteem the <HI>Joy of Faith</HI> above the <HI>Pleasures of Sin.</HI></P>
<P>He felt, that Morning, an unusual Appetite to Food; with which his Mind seem'd to be <HI>exhilarated,</HI> as looking on it a Sign of the very near Approach of <HI>Death</HI>; and said upon it, <HI>I was born on a</HI> Sabbath-Day; <HI>and I have Reason to think I was new|born on a</HI> Sabbath-Day; <HI>&amp; I hope I shall die on this</HI> Sabbath-Day: <HI>I shall look upon it as a Favour, if it may be the Will of God that it should be so: I long for the Time. Oh,</HI> why is his Chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the Wheels of his Chariots? <HI>I am very willing to part with all: I am willing to part with my dear Brother</HI> John, <HI>and never to see him again, to go to be forever with the Lord.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He had, before this, express'd a Desire, if it might be the Will of God, to live 'till his Brother returned from <HI>New-Jersey:</HI> Who, when he went away, intended, if possible, to perform his Journey and return in a Fortnight; hoping once more to meet his Brother in the Land of the Living. The Fortnight was now near expired, it ended the next Day.</NOTE> <HI>Oh, when I go there, how will God's dear Church on Earth be upon my Mind!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="006311_0280_0000000000000000">Afterwards, the same Morning, being asked, how he did, he answered, <HI>I am almost in Eternity: I long to be there. My Work, is done: I have done with all my Friends: All the World is nothing to me. I long to be in Heaven,</HI> praising and glorifying GOD <HI>with the holy</HI> Angels: <HI>All my Desire is to glorify God.</HI></P>
<P>During the whole of these last two Weeks of his Life, he seem'd to continue in this Frame of Heart, loose from all the World, as having done his Work, and done with all Things here below, having nothing to do but to die, and abiding in an earnest Desire and Expectation of the happy Moment, when his Soul should take it's Flight, and go to a State of Perfection of Holiness and perfect glorifying and enjoying God, manifested in a variety of Expressions. He said, <HI>That the Consideration of the Day of Death, and the Day of Judgment, had a long Time been peculiarly sweet to him.</HI> He from Time to Time spake of his being willing to leave the Body and the World <HI>immediately,</HI> that Day, that Night, and that Moment, if it was the Will of God. He also was much in expressing his Longings that the Church of Christ on <HI>Earth</HI> might flourish, and Christ's Kingdom here might be advanced, notwithstanding he was about to leave the <HI>Earth,</HI> and should not with his Eyes behold the desirable Event, nor be instrumental in promoting it. He said to me, one Morn|ing, as I came into the Room, <HI>My Thoughts have been employed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the old dear Theme,</HI> The Prosperity <HI>of God's Church on</HI> Earth. <HI>As I waked out of Sleep, I was led to cry for the pouring out of God's Spirit, and the Advancement of Christ's Kingdom, which the dear Redeemer did and suffered so much for. 'Tis</HI> that <HI>especi|ally makes me long for it.</HI>&mdash; He expressed much Hope that a glo|rious Advancement of Christ's Kingdom, was <HI>near</HI> at Hand.</P>
<P>He once told me, that <HI>he had formerly longed for the Out|pouring of the Spirit of God, and the glorious Times of the Church, and hoped they were coming; and should have been willing to have lived to promote Religion at that Time, if that had been the Will of God; But</HI> (says he) <HI>I am willing it should be as it is; I would not have the Choice to make for my self, for ten Thousand Worlds.</HI> He expressed on his Death-Bed a full Perswasion, that he should in <HI>Heaven</HI> see the Prosperity of the Church on <HI>Earth,</HI> and should rejoyce with Christ therein; And the Consideration of it seem'd to be highly pleasing and satisfying to his Mind.</P>
<P>He also still dwelt much on the great Importance of the Work of <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel; and express'd his Longings, that they might be <HI>fill'd with the Spirit of God</HI>; and manifested much Desire to see some of the Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ghbouring Minist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, whom he
<PB N="248" REF="006311_0281_0000000000000000">
had some Acquaintance with, and whose sincere Friendship he was confident of, that he might converse freely with them on that Subject, before he died. And it so happened, that he had Opportunity with some of them, according to his Desire.</P>
<P>Another Thing that lay much on his Heart, and that he spake of, from Time to Time, in these near Approaches of Death, was the spiritual Prosperity of his own Congregation of Christian <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>New-Jersey</HI>: and when he spake of them, it was with peculiar Tenderness; so that his Speech would be presently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nterrupted and drowned with Tears.</P>
<P>He also expressed much Satisfaction in the Disposals of Pro|vidence, with Regard to the Circumstance of his <HI>Death</HI>; par|ticularly that God had before his Death given him the Oppor|tunity he had had in <HI>Boston,</HI> with so many considerable Persons, Ministers and others, to give in <HI>his Testimony</HI> for God, and against false Religion, and many Mistakes that lead to it, and promote it; and there to lay before pious and charitable Gen|tlemen, the State of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and their Necessities, to so good Effect; and that God had since given him Opportunity to write to them further concerning these Affairs; and to write other Letters of Importance, that he hoped might be of good Influence with Regard to the State of Religion among the <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> and elsewhere, after his Death. He express'd great Thank|fulness to God for his Mercy in these Things. He also men|tioned it as what he accounted a merciful Circumstances of his Death, that he should die <HI>here</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The Editor takes Leave to make the Remark, that when Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> was at <HI>Boston,</HI> sick nigh unto Death, it was with Reluctance he thought of dying in a Place where <HI>Funerals</HI> are often attended with a <HI>Pomp</HI> &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, which (especially on Occasion of his own) he was very averse to any Appearance of: And tho' it was with some Difficulty he got his Mind reconciled to the Prospect then before him, yet at last he was bro't to acquiesce in the Divine Will, with Respect to this Circumstance of his Departure. However, it pleased God to order the Event so as to gratify his <HI>Desire,</HI> which he had express'd, of getting back to <HI>Northampton,</HI> with a View particularly to a more silent and private <HI>Burial.</HI></NOTE>. And speaking of these Things, he said, <HI>God had granted him all his Desire</HI>; and signified, that now he could with the greater Alacrity leave the World.]</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="006311_0282_0000000000000000">Monday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 28. I was able to read, and make some few Corrections in my private Writings; but found I could not write, as I had done; I found my self sensibly declined in all Respects. It has been only from a little while before Noon, 'till about one or two o'Clock, that I have been able to do any Thing for some Time past: yet this refresh'd my Heart, that I could do any Thing, either publick or private, that I hoped was for GOD.</P>
<P>[This Evening, he was suppos'd to be dying: He tho't so himself, and was tho't so by those who were about him. He seem'd glad at the Appearance of the near Approach of Death. He was almost Speechless, but his Lips appear'd to move; and One that sat very near him, heard him utter such Expressions as these, <HI>Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly.</HI>&mdash; Oh, <HI>why is his Chariot so long in coming!</HI> &mdash; After he revived, he blamed himself for having been too eager to be gone. And in expressing what he found in the Frame of his Mind at that Time, he said, he then found an inexpressibly sweet Love to those that he look|ed upon as <HI>belonging to Christ,</HI> beyond almost all that ever he felt before; so that it <HI>seem'd</HI> (to use his own Words) <HI>like a little Piece of</HI> Heaven <HI>to have one of them near him.</HI> And being asked, whether he heard the Prayer that was (at his Desire) made with him; he said, <HI>Yes, he heard every Word, and had an uncommon Sense of the Things that were uttered in that Prayer, and that every Word reach'd his Heart.</HI></P>
<P>On the Evening of the next next, viz. Tuesday, <HI>Septemb&punc;</HI> 29. As he lay in his Bed, he seem'd to be in an extraordinary Frame; his Mind greatly engaged in sweet Meditations con|cerning the Prosperity of <HI>Zion</HI>: There being present here at that Time two young Gentlemen of his Acquaintance, that were <HI>Candidates</HI> for the <HI>Ministry,</HI> he desired us all to unite in singing a Psalm on that Subject, even <HI>Zion</HI>'s Prosperity. And on his Desire we sung a Part of the CII <HI>Psalm.</HI> This seem'd much to refresh and revive him, and gave him new Strength; so that, tho' before he could scarcely speak at all, now he pro|ceeded, with some Freedom of Speech, to give his dying Coun|sels to those two young Gentlemen forementioned, relating to their Preparation for, and Prosecution of that great Work of the Ministry they were designed for; and in particular, earnestly recommended to 'em frequent secret <HI>Fasting</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI>: And enforced his Counsel with Regard to this, from his own <HI>Experi|ence</HI> of the great Comfort and Benefit of it&punc; which (said he) I should not mention, were it not that I am a <HI>dying</HI> Person. And
<PB N="250" REF="006311_0283_0000000000000000">
after he had finished his Counsel, he made a Prayer, in the Au|dience of us all; wherein, besides praying for this Family, for his Brethren, and those Candidates for the Ministry, and for his own Congregation, he earnestly prayed for the reviving and flourishing of Religion in the World.</P>
<P>'Till now, he had every Day set up Part of the Day; but after this he never rose from his Bed.]</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>Sept.</HI> 30. I was obliged to keep my Bed the whole Day, thro' Weakness. However, redeem'd a little Time, and with the Help of my Brother, read and corrected about a Dozen Pages in my M.S. giving an Account of my Conversion.</P>
<P>Thursday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 1. I endeavoured again to do something by Way of writing, but soon found my Powers of Body and Mind utterly fail. Felt not so sweetly, as when I was able to do something that I hoped would do some Good.

<P>His Distemper now very apparently prey'd on his Vitals in an extraordinary Manner: Not by a sudden breaking of <HI>Ulcers</HI> in his Lungs, as at <HI>Boston,</HI> but by a constant Discharge of purulent Matter, in great Quantities: So that what he bro't up by Expectoration, seem'd to be as it were Mout<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of almost clear <HI>Pus</HI>; which was attended with very great inward Pain and Distress.</P>
<P>On Thursday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 6. He lay, for a considerable Time, as if he were dying.

<P>The next Day, <HI>viz.</HI> Wednesday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 7. His Brother <HI>John</HI> arrived, being returned from <HI>New-Jersey</HI>; where he had been detained much longer than he intended, by a mortal Sickness prevailing among the Christian <HI>Indians,</HI> and by some other Things in their Circumstances that made his Stay with them necessary. Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffected and refresh'd with seeing him, and appeared fully satisfied with the Reasons of his Delay; seeing the Interest of Religion and of the Souls of his People required it.</P>
<P>The next Day, Thursday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 8. He was in great Distress and Agonies of Body; and for the bigger Part of the Day, was much disordered as to the Exercise of his Reason. In the Even|ing, he was more composed, and had the Use of his Reason well; but the Pain of his Body continued and increased. He told me, it was impossible for any to concei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the Distress he felt in his Breast. He manifested much Concern left he should dishonour God by Impatience, under his extreme Agony; which was such, that he said, the Thought of enduring it one Minute longer was almost insupportable. He desired, that others would be much in lifting up their Hearts continually to God for him, that God would support him, and give him Patience. He sig|nified,
<PB N="253" REF="006311_0286_0000000000000000">
that he expected to die that Night; but seem'd to fear a longer Delay: and the Disposition of his Mind with Regard to Death appeared still the same that it had been all along. And notwithstanding his bodily Agonies, yet the Interest of <HI>Zion</HI> lay still with great Weight on his Mind; as appeared by some con|siderable Discourse he had that Evening with the Rev.

Towards Day, his Eyes fix'd; and he continued lying immoveable, 'till about 6 o'Clock in the Morning, and then expired, on Friday, <HI>Octob.</HI> 9. 1747. when his Soul, as we may well conclude, was received by his dear Lord and Matter, as an eminently faithful Servant, into that State of Perfection of Holiness, and Fruition of God, which he had so often and so ardently longed for; and was welcom'd by the glorious Assembly in the upper World, as one peculiarly fitted to join them in their blessed Employments and Enjoyments.</P>
<P>Much Respect was shewn to his Memory at his <HI>Funeral</HI>; which was on the Monday following, after a Sermon preach'd the same Day, on that solemn Occasion.

This Love or Desire represented as most genuine; not induced by mean and mercenary Views; not primarily springing from selfish Hopes of Salvation, whereby the divine Glories would be Sacri|ficed to the Idol Self; not arising from a slavish Fear of Divine Anger in Case of Neglect, nor yet from Hopes of feeling the Sweetness of that tender and pleasant Passion of Love in one's own Breast; but from a just Esteem of the beauteous Object belov|ed. This <HI>Love</HI> further represented, as attended with vehement Longings after the Enjoyment of it's Object, but unable to find by what Means.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Understanding</HI> again introduced, as informing (1.) How God might have been enjoyed, yea, how he must necessarily have been enjoyed, had not Man sin'd against him; that as there was <HI>Knowledge, Likeness,</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> so there must needs be Enjoyment, while there was no Impediment. (2.) How he may be en|joyed in some Measure now, <HI>viz.</HI> by the same <HI>Knowledge</HI> be|getting <HI>Likeness</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> which will be answer'd with Returns of <HI>Love,</HI> and the Smiles of God's Countenance, which are better than Life. (3.) How Go'd may be perfectly en|joyed, <HI>viz.</HI> by the Soul's perfect Freedom from Sin. This perfect Freedom never obtain'd 'till Death; and then not by any unaccountable Means, or in any unheard-of Manner; but the same by which it has obtain'd some Likeness to and Fruition of God in this World, <HI>viz.</HI> a clear Manifestation of him.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Holy Desire</HI> appears, and enquires why the Soul may not be perfectly holy; and so perfect in the Enjoyment of God here; and expresses most insatiable Thirstings after such a Temper, and such Fruition, and most consummate Blessedness.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Understanding</HI> again appears, and informs, that God designs that those whom he sanctifies in Part here, and intends for immortal Glory, shall tarry a while in this present evil World, that their own Experience of Temptations <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may teach 'em how great the Deliverance is, which God has wrought for 'em, that they may be swallowed up in Thankfulness and Admira|tion to Eternity; as also that they may be instrumental of doing Good to their Fellow-Men. Now if they were perfectly holy <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a World of Sin would not be a fit Habitation for them: and further, such Manifestations of God as are necessary compleatly to sanctify the Soul, would be insupportable to the Body, so that we can't <HI>see God and live.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><PB N="256" REF="006311_0289_0000000000000000">7. <HI>Holy Impatience</HI> is next introduced, complaining of the Sins and Sorrows of Life, and almost repining at the Distance of a State of Perfection, uneasy to see and feel the Hours hang so dull and heavy, and almost concluding that the Temptations, Hardships, Disappointments, Imperfections, and tedious Employ|ments of Life will never come to a happy Period.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Tender Conscience</HI> comes in, and meekly reproves the Complaints of <HI>Impatience</HI>; urging how careful and watchful we ought to be, left we should offend the divine Being with Com|plaints; alledging also the Fitness of our waiting patiently upon God for all we want, and that in a Way of doing and suffering; and at the same Time mentioning the Barrenness of the Soul, how much precious Time is misimproved, and how little it has enjoyed of God, compared with what it might have done; as also suggesting how frequently impatient Complaints spring from nothing better than Self-love, want of Resignation, and a greater Reverence of the Divine Being.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Judgment</HI> or <HI>sound Mind</HI> next appears, and duly weigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Complaints of <HI>Impatience,</HI> and the gentle Admonitions of <HI>tender Conscience,</HI> and impartially determines between 'em. On the one hand, it concludes, that we may always be impatient with Sin; and supposes, that we may also with such Sorrow, Pain, and Discouragement, as hinder our Pursuit of Holiness, tho' they arise from the weakness of Nature. It allows us to be impatient of the Distance at which we stand from a State of Perfection and Blessedness. It further indulges Impatience at the Delay of Time, when we desire the Period of it for no other End than that we may with Angels be employed in the most lively spiritual Acts of Devotion, and in giving all possible Glory to him that lives forever. Temptations and sinful Im|perfections, it thinks we may justly be uneasy with; and Dis|appointments, at least those that relate to our Hopes of Com|munion with God, and growing Conformity to him. And as to the tedious Employments and Hardships of Life, it supposes some Longing for the End of 'em not inconsistent with a Spirit of Faithfulness, and a chearful Disposition to perform the one and endure the other: It supposes, that a faithful Servant, who fully designs to do all he possibly can, may still justly long for the Evening; and that no rational Man would blame his kind and tender Spouse, if he perceived her longing to be with him, while yet Faithfulness &amp; Duty to him might still induce her to yield, for the present, to remain at a painful Distance from him. &mdash; On the other Hand, it approves of the Caution, Care and Watchful|ness
<PB N="257" REF="006311_0290_0000000000000000">
of <HI>tender Conscience,</HI> left the Divine Being should be offended with impatient Complaints: It acknowledges the Fitness of our <HI>waiting upon God,</HI> in a Way of patient doing and suffering; But supposes this very consistent with ardent Desires to <HI>depart and to be with Christ.</HI> It owns it fit that we should always remember our own Barrenness, and thinks also that we should be impatient of it, and consequently long for a State of Freedom from it; and this, not so much that we may feel the Happiness of it, but that God may have the Glory. It grants, that impatient Com|plains often spring from Self-love, and Want of Resignation and Humility. Such as these it disapproves; and determines, we should be impatient only of Absence from God, &amp; Distance from that State and Temper wherein we may most glorify him.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Godly Sorrow</HI> introduced, as making her said Moan, not so much that she is kept from the free Possession and full Enjoy|ment of Happiness, but that God must be dishonoured; the Soul being still in a World of Sin, and itself imperfect. She here, with Grief, counts over past Faults, present Temptations, and Fears for the future.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Hope</HI> or <HI>holy Confidence</HI> appears, and seems perswaded that <HI>nothing shall ever separate the Soul from the Love of God in Christ Jesus.</HI> It expects divine Assistance and Grace sufficient for all the doing and suffering-Work of Time, and that Death will ere long put a happy Period to all Sin and Sorrow; and so takes Occasion to rejoyce.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Godly Fear,</HI> or <HI>holy Jealousy</HI> here steps in, and suggests some timorous Apprehensions of the Danger of Deception; mentions the Deceitfulness of the Heart, the great Influence of irregular Self-Love in a fallen Creature; enquires whether it self is not likely to have fallen in with Delusion, since the Mind is so dark, and so little of GOD appears to the Soul; and que|ries whether all it's Hopes of persevering Grace mayn't be Pre|sumption, and whether it's confident Expectations of meeting Death as a Friend, mayn't issue in Disappointment.</P>
<P N="13">13. Hereupon, <HI>Reflection</HI> appears, and minds the Person of his past Experiences; as to the preparatory Work of Convicti|on and Humiliation; The View he then had of the Impossibility of Salvation, from himself, or any created Arm: The Manifesta|tion he has likewise had of the Glory of GOD in <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> How he then admired that Glory, and chose that GOD for his only Portion, because of the Excellency and Amiableness he dis|covered in him; not from slavish Fear of being damned, if he did not, nor from base and mercenary Hopes of saving himself;
<PB N="258" REF="006311_0291_0000000000000000">
but from a just Esteem of that beauteous and glorious Object: As also how he had from Time to Time rejoyced and acquiesced in GOD, for what he is in himself; being delighted, that he is infinite in Holiness, Justice, Power, Sovereignty, as well as in Mercy, Goodness and Love: How he has likewise, Scores of Times, felt his Soul mourn for Sin, for this very Reason, because it is contrary and grievous to GOD; yes, how he has mourned over one vain and impertinent Thought, when he has been so far from Fear of the divine vindictive Wrath for it, that on the contrary he has enjoyed the highest Assurance of the divine ever|lasting Love: How he has, from Time to Time, delighted in the Commands of God, for their own Purity and Perfection, and longed exceedingly to be conformed to 'em, and even to be <HI>holy as GOD is holy</HI>; and counted it present Heaven, to be of a heavenly Temper: How he has frequently rejoyced, to think of being for ever subject to, and dependent on GOD; account|ing it infinitely greater Happiness to glorify GOD in a State of Subjection to, and Dependance on him, than to be a <HI>god</HI> him|self; and how Heaven it self would be no Heaven to him, if he could not there be every Thing that GOD would have him be.</P>
<P N="14">14. Upon this, <HI>Spiritual Sensation</HI> being awaked, comes in, and declares that She now feels &amp; <HI>tastes that the Lord is gracious</HI>; that he is the only supreme Good, the only Soul-satisfying Hap|piness; that he is a compleat, self-sufficient, and almighty Por|tion. She whispers, <HI>Whom have I in Heaven</HI> but this GOD, this dear and blessed Portion; <HI>and there is none upon Earth</HI> I desire besides him. Oh, 'tis Heaven, to please him and to be just what he would have me be! O that my Soul were <HI>holy, as God is holy</HI>: O that it was <HI>pure, as Christ is pure</HI>; and <HI>perfect as my Father in Heaven is perfect.</HI> These are the sweetest Commands in God's Book, comprizing all others; and shall I break 'em? Must I break 'em? Am I under a fatal necessity of it, as long as I live in this World? Oh my Soul! Wo, Wo is me, that I am a Sinner! Because I now necessarily grieve and offend this blessed GOD, who is infinite in Goodness and Grace. Oh, methinks, should he punish me for my Sins, it would not wound my Heart so deep to offend him; But, tho' I sin continually, he continu|ally repeats his Kindness towards me! Oh, methinks I could bear any Suffering; but how can I bear to grieve and dishonour this blessed God! How shall I give ten Thousand Times more Honour to him? What shall I do, to glorify and worship this best of Beings? O that I could consecrate my self, Soul and Body, to his Service for ever. O that I could give up my self to him,
<PB N="259" REF="006311_0292_0000000000000000">
so as never more to attempt to be my own, or to have any Will or Affections that are not perfectly conformed to his. But Oh, Alas, Alas! I can't, I feel I can't, be thus entirely devoted to GOD: I can't live and sin not. O ye <HI>Angels,</HI> do ye glorify him incessantly: If possible, exert your selves still more, in more live|ly and ardent Devotion: If possible, prostrate your selves still lower before the Throne of the blessed King of Heaven: I long to bear a Part with you, and if it were possible, to help you. Yet when we have done, we shall not be able to offer the ten Thousandth Part of the Homage he is worthy of. While <HI>spiri|tual Sensation</HI> whispered these Things, <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Jealousy</HI> were greatly overcome; and the Soul replied, <HI>Now I know, and am assured,</HI> &amp;c. and again it welcom'd Death as a Friend, saying, <HI>O Death where is thy Sting,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="15">15. Finally, <HI>Holy Resolution</HI> concludes the Discourse, fixedly determining to <HI>follow hard after GOD,</HI> and continually to pursue a Life of Conformity to him. And the better to pursue this, en|joining it on the Soul always to remember, that GOD is the on|ly source of Happiness, that his Will is the only Rule of Recti|tude to an intelligent Creature, that Earth has nothing in it desirable for it self, or any further than GOD is seen in it; and that the Knowledge of God in Christ, begetting and maintain|ing Love, and mortifying sensual and fleshly Appetites, is the Way to be holy on Earth, and so to be attempered to the com|pleat Holiness of the heavenly World.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Should tell you, <HI>I long to see you,</HI> but that my own Experience has taught me, there is no Happiness, &amp; plenary Satisfaction to be enjoyed, in <HI>earthly Friends,</HI> tho' ever so near and dear, or in any other Enjoyment, that is not GOD himself. Therefore, if the <HI>God of all Grace</HI> would be pleased graciously to afford us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch <HI>his Presence</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> that me may perform the Work, and endure the Trials he calls us to, in a most distressing tire|some Wilderness, 'till we arrive at our Journey's End; the lo|cal Distance, at which we are held from each other at the pre|sent, is a Matter of no great Moment or Importance to either of us.

without any Floor, that I lodge in. My <HI>Work</HI> is exceeding hard and difficult: I travel on Foot a Mile and half, the worst of Way, almost daily, and back again; for I live so far from my <HI>Indians.</HI>&mdash;I have not seen an <HI>English</HI> Person this Month.&mdash; These and many other Circumstances, as uncomfortable, attend me; and yet my <HI>spiritual Conflicts</HI> and <HI>Distresses</HI> so far <HI>exceed</HI> all these, that I scarce think of them, or hardly mind but that I am entertain'd in the most sumptuous Manner.

As to my <HI>Success</HI> here, I can't say much as yet: The <HI>Indians</HI> seem generally kind, and well disposed towards me, and are mostly very attentive to my Instructions, and seem willing to be taught further: Two or three, I hope, are under some <HI>Convictions</HI>; But there seems to be little of the special workings of the divine Spirit among them yet; which gives me many a Heart-sinking Hour.

'Tis no Vertue, I know, to desire Death, only to be freed from the Miseries of Life: But I want that divine HOPE, which you observed, when I saw you last, was the very Sinews of vital Religion. Earth can <HI>do us no Good,</HI> and if there be no HOPE of our <HI>doing Good on Earth,</HI> how can we desire to live in it? And yet we ought to desire, or at least to be resign'd, to tarry in it; because 'tis the Will of our alwise Sovereign. But perhaps these Thoughts will appear melancholy and gloomy, and consequently will be very unde|sirable to you; and therefore I forbear to add.

<P>HOw amazing 'tis, that the <HI>Living,</HI> who <HI>know they must die,</HI> should notwithstanding <HI>put far away the evil Day,</HI> in a Season of Health and Prosperity; and live at such an awful Distance from a Familiarity with the Grave, and the great Concerns beyond it! And especially it may justly fill us with Surprize, that any whose Minds have been divinely <HI>enlight|ned,</HI> to behold the important Things of <HI>Eternity</HI> as they are, I say, that such should live in this Manner. And yet Sir, how frequently is this the Case! How rare are the Instances of those who live and act, from Day to Day, as on the Verge of <HI>Eternity</HI>&punc; striving to fill up all their remaining Moments, in the Service, and to the Honour of their great <HI>Master?</HI> We insensibly trifle&punc; away <HI>Time,</HI> while we seem to have enough of it; and are so strangely amused, as in a great Measure to lose a Sense of the <HI>Holiness</HI> and blessed Qualifications necessary to prepare us to be Inhabitants of the heavenly <HI>Paradise.</HI> But Oh, dear Sir, a <HI>dying Bed,</HI> if we enjoy our Reason clearly, will give another View of Things. I have now, for more than three Weeks, lain under the greatest Degree of Weakness; the greater Part of the Time, expecting daily and hourly to enter into the eternal World: sometimes have been so far gone, as to be wholly Speechless, for some Hours together. And Oh, of what vast <HI>Importance</HI> has a holy spiritual <HI>Life</HI> appear'd to me to be in this Season! I have longed to call upon all my Friends, to make it their Business to <HI>live to</HI> GOD; and especially all that are designed for, or engaged in the Service of the <HI>Sanctuary.</HI> O dear Sir, don't think it enough, to live at the Rate of <HI>common Christians.</HI> Alas, to how little Purpose do they often <HI>converse,</HI> when they meet together!

<PB N="272" REF="006311_0305_0000000000000000">
Conscience can't but condemn us for the Misimprovement of Time, while we have been conversant with them. But the Way to enjoy the divine Presence, and be fitted for distinguish|ing Service for GOD, is to live a Life of <HI>great Devotion</HI> &amp; <HI>constant Self-Dedication</HI> to him; observing the Motions and Dispositi|ons of our own Hearts, whence we may learn the Corruptions that lodge there, and our constant Need of Help from GOD for the Performance of the least Duty. And Oh, dear Sir, let me beseech you frequently to attend the great and precious Du|ties of <HI>secret Fasting</HI> and <HI>Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>I have a secret Thought, from some Things I have observed, that GOD may perhaps design you for some singular Service in the World. Oh then labour to be prepared and qualified to do much for GOD. Read Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI>'s Piece on the <HI>Af|fections,</HI> again and again; and labour to <HI>distinguish</HI> clearly upon Experiences &amp; Affections in Religion, that you may make a Diffe|rence between the <HI>Gold</HI> &amp; the shining <HI>Dress</HI>; I say, labour here, as ever you would be an <HI>useful Minister</HI> of Christ: For nothing has put such a Stop to the Work of God in the late Day as the false Religion, the wild Affections that attend it. Suffer me therefore, finally, to intreat you earnestly to <HI>give your self</HI> to Prayer, to Reading and Meditation on divine Truths: Strive to penetrate to the Bottom of them, and never be content with a superficial Knowledge. By this Means, your Thoughts will gradually grow weighty and judicious; and you hereby will be possessed of a valuable <HI>Treasure,</HI> out of which you may produce <HI>Things new and old,</HI> to the Glory of GOD.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>I commend you to the Grace of GOD</HI>; earnestly desiring, that a plentiful Portion of the divine <HI>Spirit</HI> may rest upon you; that you may <HI>live to GOD</HI> in <HI>every</HI> Capacity of Life, and do abundant Service for him in a <HI>publick,</HI> if it be his Will; and that you may be richly qualified for the <HI>Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</HI></P>

I judged, that the <HI>Approbation</HI> of so apparent and eminent a Friend and Example of inward vital Religion, and evangelical Piety in the Height of it, would probably tend to make that <HI>Book</HI> more Serviceable; especially among some Kinds of zealous Persons, whose Benefit was especially aim'd at in the Book; some of which are prejudiced against it, as written in too legal a Strain, and opposing some Things wherein the Height of Christian Experience con|sists, and tending to build Men up on their own Works.</NOTE> Value religious <HI>Joys</HI> according to the <HI>Subject-Matter</HI> of them: There are many that rejoyce in their supposed <HI>Justification</HI>; but what do these Joys argue, but only that they <HI>love themselves?</HI> Whereas, in <HI>true</HI> spiritual Joys, the Soul rejoyces in GOD for what he is <HI>in himself</HI>; blesses God for his Holiness, Sovereignty, Power, Faithfulness, and all his Perfections; adores God, that he is what he is, that he is unchangeably possess'd of Infinite Glory and Happiness. Now, when Men thus rejoyce in the <HI>Perfec|tions of God,</HI> and in the infinite Excellency of the <HI>Way</HI> of <HI>Sal|vation by Christ,</HI> and in the holy <HI>Commands</HI> of God, which are a Transcript of his holy Nature, <HI>these</HI> Joys are divine and spi|ritual.

<HEAD>AN APPENDIX. Containing some REFLECTIONS and OBSERVATIONS on the preceeding Memoirs of Mr. <HI>BRAINERD.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WE have here Opportunity, as I apprehended, in a very lively <HI>Instance,</HI> to see the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>true Religion</HI>; and the <HI>Manner</HI> of it's <HI>Operation</HI> when exemplified in a <HI>high Degree</HI> and <HI>powerful Exercise.</HI> Particularly it may be worthy to be observed:</P>
<P N="1">1. How greatly Mr. <HI>Brainerd's</HI> Religion <HI>differed</HI> from that of some Pretenders to the Experience of a <HI>clear Work</HI> of saving <HI>Conversion</HI> wro't on their Hearts; who depending and living on that, settle in a <HI>cold, careless</HI> &amp; <HI>carnal</HI> Frame of Mind, and in a Neglect of thorough, earnest Religion, in the stated Practice of it. Altho' his Convictions and Conversion were in all Res|pects exceeding clear, and very remarkable; yet how far was he from acting as tho' he thought he had <HI>got through his Work,</HI> when once he had obtained Comfort, and Satisfaction of his Interest in Christ, and Title to Heaven. On the contrary, that Work on his Heart, by which he was brought to this, was with him evidently but the <HI>Beginning of his Work,</HI> his first entring on the great Business of Religion and the Service of GOD, his first setting out in his Race. His obtaining Rest of Soul in Christ, after earnest striving to enter in at the strait Gate, and being violent to take the Kingdom of Heaven, he did not look upon as putting an End to any further Occasion for striv|ing and Violence in Religion; but these were continued still, and maintained constantly, through all Changes, to the very End of Life. His Work was not finished, nor his Race ended, 'till Life was ended; agreeable to frequent <HI>Scripture Representa|tions</HI> of the Christian Life. He continued pressing forward in a constant Manner, forgetting the Things that were behind, and teaching forth towards the Things that were before. His Pains and Earnestnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the Business of Religion were rather increas|ed,
<PB N="277" REF="006311_0310_0000000000000000">
than diminished, after he had received Comfort and Satis|faction concerning the safety of his State. Those divine Prin|ciples, which after this he was actuated by, of Love to GOD, and Longings and Thirstings after Holiness, seem to be more effectual to engage him to Pains and Activity in Religion, than Fear of Hell had been before.</P>
<P>And as his Conversion was not the End of <HI>his Work,</HI> or of the Course of his Diligence and Strivings in Religion; so nei|ther was it the End of the <HI>Work of the Spirit</HI> of GOD on his Heart: But on the contrary, the Beginning of that Work; the Beginning of his spiritual Discoveries, and holy Views; the first Dawning of the Light, which thenceforward increased more and more; the Beginning of his holy Affections, his Sorrow for Sin, his Love to GOD, his Rejoycing in Christ Jesus, his Longings after Holiness. And the powerful Operations of the Spirit of God in these Things, were carried on, from the Day of his Conversion, in a continued Course, to his dying Day. His religious Experiences, his Admiration, his Joy, and Praise, and flowing Affections, did not only hold up to a considerable Height for a few Days, Weeks or Months, at first, while Hope and Comfort were new Things with him; and then gradually dwindle and die away, 'till they came to almost nothing, and so leave him without any sensible or remarkable Experience of spiritual Discoveries, or holy and divine Affections, for Months together; as it is with many, who after the Newness of Things is over, soon come to that pass, that it is again with 'em very much as it is used to be before their supposed Conversion, with Respect to any present Views of GOD's Glory, of Christ's Excel|lency, or of the Beauty of divine Things; and with Respect to any present Thirstings for GOD, or ardent Out-goings of their Souls after divine Objects: But only now and then they have a comfortable Reflection on Things they have met with in Times past, and are something affected with them; and so rest easy, thinking all Things are well; they have had a good <HI>clear Work,</HI> and their State is safe, and they doubt not but they shall go to Heaven when they die. How far otherwise was it with Mr. <HI>Brainerd,</HI> than it is with such Persons&punc; His Experiences, in|stead of dying away, were evidently of an increasing Nature. His first Love and other holy Affection<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, even at the Beginning were very great; but after Months and Yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; became mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h greater, and more remarkable; and the Spiritual Exercises <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his Mind continued exceeding great (tho' not equally so at all Times, yet usually so) without indu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="278" REF="006311_0311_0000000000000000">
habitual dwindling &amp; dying away, even 'till his Decease. They began in a Time of general Deadness all over the Land, and were greatly increased in a Time of general Reviving of Religion. And when Religion decayed again, and a general Deadness returned, his Experiences were still kept up in their Height, and his holy Exercises maintained in their Life and Vigour; and so continued to be, in a general Course, wherever he was, and whatever his Circumstances were, among <HI>English</HI> and <HI>In|dians,</HI> in Company and alone, in Towns and Cities, and in the howling Wilderness, in Sickness and in Health, living and dying. This is agreeable to Scripture-Descriptions of true and right Re|ligion, and of the Christian Life. The Change, that was wrought in him at his Conversion, was agreeable to Scripture-Represen|tations of that Change which is wrought in true Conversion; a great Change and an abiding Change, rendring him a new Man, a new Creature: Not only a Change as to Hope and Comfort, and an Apprehension of his own good Estate; and a transient Change, consisting in high Flights, of passing Affections; but a Change of <HI>Nature,</HI> a Change of the abiding Habit and Temper of his Mind. Nor a partial Change, meerly in Poin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Opinion, or outward Reformation; much less a Change from one Error to another, or from one Sin to another: but an univer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al Change, both internal and external; as from cor|rupt and dangerous Principles in Religion, unto the Belief of the Truth, so from both the Habits and Ways of Sin, unto uni|versal Holiness of Heart and Practice; from the Power and Service of <HI>Satan</HI> unto GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. His Religion did apparently and greatly <HI>differ</HI> from that of many high Pretenders to Religion, who are frequently ac|tuated by <HI>vehement Emotions</HI> of Mind, and are carried on in a Course of <HI>sudden</HI> and <HI>strong Impressions,</HI> and supposed <HI>high Illu|minations</HI> and <HI>immediate Discoveries,</HI> and at the same Time are Persons of a virulent <HI>Zeal, not according to Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>His Convictions, proceeding his Conversion, did not arise from any frightful <HI>Impressions on his Imagination,</HI> or any external Images and Ideas of Fire and Brimstone, a Sword of Vengeance drawn, a dark Pit open, Devils in terrible Shapes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> strongly fix'd in his Mind. His Sight of his own Sinfulness did not con|sist in any Imagination of a heap of loathsom material Filthines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> within him&punc; nor did his Sense of the Hardness of his Heart consist in any bodily feeling in his Breast something hard and heavy like a Stone, nor in any Imaginations whatever of such a Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="006311_0312_0000000000000000">His first Discovery of God or Christ, at his Conversion, was not any strong Idea of any external Glory or Brightness, or Majesty and Beauty of Countenance, or pleasant Voice; nor was it any supposed immediate Manifestation of God's Love to <HI>him</HI> in particular; nor any Imagination of Christ's smiling Face, Arms open, or Words immediately spoken to him, as by Name, revealing Christ's Love to <HI>him</HI>; either Words of Scripture, or any other: But a Manifestation of God's Glory, and the Beauty of his Nature, as supremely excellent in it self; powerfully drawing&punc; and sweetly captivating his Heart; bringing him to a hearty Desire to exalt God, set him on the Throne, and give him supreme Honour and Glory, as the King and Sovereign of the Universe; and also a new Sense of the infinite Wisdom, Suitableness and Excellency of the Way of Salvation by Christ; powerfully engaging his whole Soul to embrace this Way of Salvation, and to delight in it. His first Faith did not consist in believing that Christ loved him, and died for him, in particular. His first Comfort was not from any secret Sug|gestion of God's Eternal Love to him, or that God was recon|ciled to him or intended great Mercy for him; by any such Texts as those, <HI>Son, be of good Chear, thy Sins are forgiven thee&punc; Fear not, I am thy God,</HI> &amp;c. or in any such Way. On the contrary, when GOD's Glory was first discovered to him, it was without any Thought of Salvation as his own. His first Experience of the sanctifying &amp; comforting Power of GOD's Spirit did not begin in some bodily Sensation, any pleasant warm Feeling in his Breast, that he (as some others) called the Feeling the Love of Christ in him, and being full of the Spirit. How exceeding far were his Experiences at his first Conversion from Things of such a Nature!</P>
<P>And if we look thro' the whole Series of his Experiences, from his Conversion to his Death, we shall find none of this Kind. I have had Occasion to read his <HI>Diary</HI> over and over, and very particularly and critically to review every Passage in it; and I find no one Instance of a strong Impression on his Ima|gination, through his whole Life: No Instance of a strongly impress'd Idea of any external Glory and Brightness, of any bodily Form or Shape, any beautiful Majestick Countenance: No imaginary Sight of Christ hanging on the Cross, with his Blood streaming from his Wounds; or seated in Heaven on a bright Throne, with Angels and Saints bowing before him; or with a Countenance smiling on him; or Arms open to embrace him: No Sight of Heaven, in his Imagination, with Gates of
<PB N="280" REF="006311_0313_0000000000000000">
Pearl, and Golden Streets, and vast Multitudes of glorious In|habitants, with shining Garments; No Sight of the Book of Life opened, with his Name written in it: No hearing of the sweet Musick made by the Songs of heavenly Hosts; No hear|ing God or Christ immediately speaking to him; nor any sud|den Suggestions of Words or Sentences, either Words of Scripture, or any other, as then immediately spoken or sent to him: No new objective Revelations, no sudden strong Sug|gestions of secret Facts. Nor do I find any one Instance in all the Records he has left of his own Life, from Beginning to End, of Joy excited from a supposed <HI>immediate</HI> Witness of the Spirit; or inward immediate Suggestion, that his State was surely good, that God loved him with an everlasting Love, that Christ died for him in particular, and that Heaven was his; either with or without a Text of Scripture: No Instance of Comfort by a sudden bearing in upon his Mind, as tho' at that very Time directed by God to him in particular, any such kind of Texts as those; <HI>Fear not, I am with thee; &mdash; It is your Father's good Pleasure to give you the Kingdom; &mdash; You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you; &mdash; I have called thee by thy Name, thou art mine; &mdash; Before thou wast formed in the Belly, I knew thee,</HI> &amp;c. No supposed Communion &amp; Conversation with GOD carried on in this Way; no such supposed Tasting of the Love of Christ. But the Way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was satisfied of his own good Estate, even to the entire abolishing of Fear, was by Feeling within himself the lively actings of a holy Temper and heavenly Dis|position, the vigorous Exercises of that divine Love, which casts out Fear: This was the Way he had full Satisfaction soon af|ter his Conversion (see his <HI>Diary</HI> on <HI>Octob.</HI> 18 &amp; 19. 1740.) And we find no other Way of Satisfaction through his whole Life afterwards: And this he abundantly declared to be the Way, the only Way, that he had complete Satisfaction, when he looked Death in the Face, in it's near Approaches.</P>
<P>Some of the Pretenders to an <HI>immediate</HI> Witness by Suggesti|on, and Defenders of it, with an assuming Confidence, would bear us in Hand, that there is no full Assurance without it; and that the Way of being satisfied by Signs, and arguing an Inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st in Christ from Sanctification, if it will keep Men qui|et in Life and Health, yet will never do when they come to <HI>die</HI>: Then (they say) Men must have <HI>immediate</HI> Witness, or else be in a dreadful Uncertainty. But Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Experi|ence is a Confutation of this; for in him we have an Instance of one that possess'd as constant and unshaken an Assurance,
<PB N="281" REF="006311_0314_0000000000000000">
thro' the Course of his Life, after Conversion, as perhaps can be produced in this Age; which yet he obtain'd and enjoy'd without any such Sort of <HI>Testimony,</HI> and without all Manner of Appearance of it, or Pretence to it; yea, while utterly disclaim|ing any such Thing, and declaring against it: And one whose Assurance, we need not scruple to affirm, has as fair a Claim, and as just a Pretension to Truth and Genuineness, as any that the Pretenders to <HI>immediate Witness</HI> can produce: And not only an Instance of one that had such Assurance in Life, but had it in a constant Manner in his last Illness; and particularly in the latter Stages of it, through those last Months of his Life, wherein <HI>Death</HI> was more sensibly approaching, without the least Hope of Life: And had it too in it's <HI>Fulness,</HI> and in the Height of it'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Exercise, under those repeated Trials, that he had in this Space of Time; when brought from Time to Time to the very Brink of the Grave, expecting in a few Minutes to be in Eternity. He had <HI>the full Assurance of Hope, unto the End.</HI> When on the Verge of Eternity, he then declares his Assurance to be such as perfectly secluded all Fear; and not only so, but it manifestly fill'd his Soul with exceeding Joy: He declaring at the same Time, that this his Consolation and good Hope thro' Grace arose wholly from the <HI>Evidence</HI> he had of his good Estate, by what he found of his Sanctification, or the Exercise of a holy heavenly Temper of Mind, supreme Love to God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and not in the least from any <HI>immediate</HI> Witness by Suggestion: Yea, he declares that at these very Times he saw the awful <HI>Delusion</HI> of that Confidence which is built on such a Foundation, as well as of the whole of that Religion which it usually springs from, or at least is the Attendant of; and that his Soul abhor'd those Delusions: And he continued in this Mind, often expressing it with much Solemnity, even 'till Death.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Religion was not <HI>selfish</HI> and <HI>mercenary:</HI> His Love to God was primarily and principally for the supreme Excellency of his <HI>own Nature,</HI> and not built on a preconceived Notion that God loved <HI>him,</HI> had received <HI>him</HI> into Favour, and had done great Things <HI>for him,</HI> or promised great Things <HI>to him:</HI> So his Joy was Joy in God, and not in himself. We see by his <HI>Diary</HI> how, from Time to Time, through the Course of his Life, his Soul was fill'd with ineffable Sweetness and Comfort. But what was the Spring of this strong and abiding Conso|lation? Not so much the Consideration of the sure Grounds he had to think that his State was good, that God had delivered
<PB N="282" REF="006311_0315_0000000000000000">
him from Hell, and that Heaven was <HI>his</HI>; or any Thoughts concerning his own distinguished happy and exalted Circum|stances, as a high Favourite of Heaven: But the sweet Medi|tations and entertaining Views he had of divine Things <HI>without himself</HI>; the affecting Considerations and lively Ideas of God's infinite Glory, his unchangeable Blessedness, his Sovereignty and universal Dominion; together with the sweet Exercises of Love to GOD, giving himself up to him, abasing himself be|fore him, denying himself for him, depending upon him, acting for his Glory, diligently serving him; and the pleasing Pros|pects or Hopes he had of a future Advancement of the King|dom of Christ, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It appears plainly and abundantly all along, from his Conver|sion to his Death, that that Beauty, that Sort of Good, which was the great Object of the new Sense of his Mind, the new Relish and Appetite given him in Conversion, and thencefor|ward maintained and increased in his Heart, was HOLINESS, Conform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty to God, living to God, and glorifying Him. This was what drew his Heart; this was the Center of his Soul; this was the Ocean to which all the Streams of his religious Affec|tions tended: This was the Object that engaged his eager thirsting Desires and earnest Pursuits: He knew no true Excel|lency or Happiness, but this: This was what he longed for most vehemently and constantly on <HI>Earth</HI>; and this was with him the Beauty and Blessedness of <HI>Heaven</HI>; which made him so much and so often to long for that World of Glory; it was to be perfectly holy, and perfectly exercised in the holy Employ|ments of Heaven; thus to glorify God and enjoy him forever.</P>
<P>His religious Illuminations, Affections and Comfort seem'd, to a great Degree, to be attended with <HI>Evangelical Humiliation</HI>; consisting in a Sense of his own utter Insufficiency, Despicable|ness and Odiousness; with an answerable Disposition and Frame of Heart. How deeply affected was he almost continually with his great Defects in Religion; with his vast Distance from that Spirituality and holy Frame of Mind that became him; with his Ignorance, Pride, Deadness, Unsteadiness, Barrenness? He was not only affected with the Remembrance of his former Sinfulness, before his Conversion, but with the Sense of his pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t Vilenes and Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lution. He was not only disposed to think meanly of himself as <HI>before God,</HI> and in Comparison of him; but <HI>amongst Men,</HI> and as compared with them: He was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to think other Saints better than he; yea, to look on himself as the meanest and cast of Saints; yea, very often, as the
<PB N="283" REF="006311_0316_0000000000000000">
vilest and worst of Mankind. And notwithstanding his great Attainments in <HI>spiritual Knowledge,</HI> yet we find there is scarce any Thing that he is more frequently affected and abased with a Sense of, than his <HI>Ignorance.</HI></P>
<P>How eminently did he appear to be of a <HI>meek</HI> and <HI>quiet</HI> Spirit, resembling the Lamb-like, Dove-like Spirit of Jesus Christ! How full of Love, Meekness, Quietness, Forgiveness and Mercy! His Love was not meerly a Fondness and Zeal for a Party, but an universal Benevolence; very often exercised in the most sensible and ardent Love to his greatest Opposers and Enemies. His Love and Meekness were not a meer Pretence, and out|ward Profession and Shew; but they were effectual Things, manifested in expensive and painful Deeds of Love and Kind|ness; and in a meek Behaviour; readily confessing Faults under the greatest Trials, and humbling himself even at the Feet of those from whom he supposed he had suffered most; and from Time to Time, very frequently praying for his Enemies, ab|horring the Thoughts of Bitterness or Resentment towards them. I scarcely know where to look for any parallel Instance of Self-denial, in these Respects, in the present Age. He was a Person of great Zeal; but how did he abhor a bitter Zeal, and lament it where he saw it! And tho' he was once drawn into some Degrees of it, by the Force of prevailing Example, as it were in his Childhood; yet how did he go about with a Heart bruised and broken in Pieces for it all his Life after!</P>
<P>Of how <HI>soft</HI> and <HI>tender</HI> a Spirit was he! How far were his Experiences, Hopes, and Joys from a Tendency finally to stupi|fy and harden him, to lessen Convictions and Tenderness of Conscience, to cause him to be less affected with present and past Sins, and less conscientious with Respect to future Sins, more easy in the Neglect of Duties that are troublesome and inconvenient, more slow and partial in complying with difficult Commands, less apt to be alarmed at the Appearance of his own Defects and Transgressions, more easily induced to a Com|pliance with carnal Appetites! On the contrary, how tender was his Conscience! How apt was his Heart to smite him! How easily and greatly was he alarmed at the Appearance of moral Evil! How great and constant was his Jealousy over his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">! How strict his Care and Watchfulness against Sin! How deep and sensible were the Wounds that Sin made in his Conscience! Those Evils that are generally accounted small, were almost an insupportable Burden to him; such as his inward Deficiencies, his having no more Love to GOD, find|ing
<PB N="284" REF="006311_0317_0000000000000000">
within himself any slackness or dulness in Religion, any Unsteadiness, or wandring Frame of Mind, &amp;c. How did the Consideration of such Things as these oppress and abase him, and fill him with inward Shame and Confusion! His Love and Hope, tho' they were such as cast out a servile Fear of Hell, yet they were such as were attended with, and abundantly che|rish'd and promoted a reverential filial Fear of GOD, a Dread of Sin and of God's holy Displeasure. His Joy seem'd truly to be a rejoicing with Trembling. His Assurance and Com|fort differed greatly from a false enthusiastick Confidence and Joy, in that it promoted and maintained Mourning for Sin: holy mourning, with him, was not only the Work of an Hour or a Day, at his first Conversion; but Sorrow for Sin was like a Wound constantly running: He was a Mourner for Sin all his Days. He did not, after he received Comfort and full Satis|faction of the Forgiveness of all his Sins, and the Safety of his State, forget his past Sins, the Sins of his Youth, that were committed before his Conversion; but the Remembrance of them, from Time to Time, reviv'd in his Heart, with renew|ed Grief. That in Ezek xvi.63. was evidently fulfil'd in him, <HI>That thou mayst remember, and be confounded, and never open thy Mouth any more, because of thy Shame; when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done.</HI> And how lastingly did the Sins that he committed after his Conversion, affect and break his Heart! If he did any Thing whereby he thought he had in any Respect dishonoured GOD, and wounded the Interest of Religion, he had never done with calling it to Mind with Sorrow and Bitterness: Tho' he was assured that GOD had forgiven it, yet he never forgave himself: His past Sorrows and Fears made no Satisfaction, with him; but still the Wound renews and bleeds afresh, again and again. And his present Sins, that he daily found in himself, were an Occasion of daily sensible and deep Sorrow of Heart.</P>
<P>His Religion did not consist in una<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">countable <HI>Flights</HI> and vehement <HI>Pangs</HI>; suddenly rising, and suddenly falling; at some Turns exalted almost to the third Heavens, and then at other Turns negligent, vain, carnal, and swallowed up with the World; for Days and Weeks, if not Months together. His Religion was not like a blazing Meteor, or like a flaming Comet, (or a wandring Star, as the Apostle <HI>Jude</HI> calls it, ver. 13.) flying thro' the Firmament with a bright Train; &amp; then quickly going out in perfect Darkness: But more like the steady Lights of Hea|ven; that are constant Principles of Light, tho' sometimes hid
<PB N="285" REF="006311_0318_0000000000000000">
with Clouds. Nor like a Land-Flood, which flows far and wide, with a rapid Stream, bearing down all afore it, and then dried up; but more like a Stream fed by living Springs; which tho' sometimes increased by Showers, and at other Times di|minished by Drought, yet is a <HI>constant Stream.</HI></P>
<P>His religious Affections and Joys were not like those of some, who have Rapture and mighty Emotions from Time to Time in <HI>Company</HI>; but have very little Affection in <HI>Retirement</HI> and secret Places. Tho' he was of a very sociable Temper, and loved the Company of Saints, and delighted very much in religi|ous Conversation and in social Worship; yet his warmest Af|fections and their greatest Effects on animal Nature, and his sweetest Joys, were in his Closet-Devotions, and solitary Trans|actions between GOD and his own Soul; as is very observable thro' his whole Course, from his Conversion to his Death. He delighted greatly in sacred Retirements; and loved to get quite away from all the World, to converse with GOD alone, in secret Duties.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Brainerd's</HI> Experiences and Comforts were very far from being like those of some Persons, which are attended with a spiritual <HI>Satiety,</HI> and put an End to their religious Desires and Longings, at least to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and Ardency of them; resting sati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fied in their own Attainments and Comforts, as having ob|tained their chief End, which is to extinguish their Fears of Hell, and give 'em Confidence of the Favour of GOD. How far were his religious Aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctions, Refreshments, &amp; Satisfactions, from such an Operation and Influence as this! On the contra|ry, how were they always attended with Longings and Thirst|ings after greater Degrees of <HI>Conformity</HI> to GOD! And the greater and sweeter his Comforts were, the more vehement were his Desires after <HI>Holiness.</HI> For 'tis to be observed, that his Longings were not so much after joyful Discoveries of God's Love and clear Views of his Title to future Advancement and eternal Honours in Heaven; as after more of present Holiness, greater Spirituality, an Heart more engaged for GOD, to love and exalt and depend on him, an Ability better to serve him, to do more for his Glory, and to do all that he did with more of a Regard to Christ as his Righteousness and Strength; and after the Enlargement and Advancement of Christ's Kingdom in the Earth. And his Desires were not idle wishings and wouldings, but such as were powerful and effectual, to ani|mate him to the earnest, eager pursuit of these Things, with utmost Diligence and unfainting Labour and Self-denial. His
<PB N="286" REF="006311_0319_0000000000000000">
Comforts never put an End to his seeking after GOD, and striving to obtain his Grace; but on the contrary, greatly en|gaged and enlarged him therein.</P>
<P>His Religion did not consist only in <HI>Experience,</HI> without <HI>Prac|tice.</HI> All his inward Illuminations, Affections and Comforts seem'd to have a direct Tendency to Practice, and to issue in it: And this, not meerly a Practice <HI>negatively</HI> good, free from gross Acts of Irreligion and Immorality: But a Practice <HI>posi|tively</HI> Holy and Christian, in a serious, devout, humble, meek, merciful, charitable, and beneficent Conversation; making the Service of GOD, and our Lord Jesus Christ, the great Bu|siness of Life, which he was devoted to, and pursued with the greatest Earnestness and Diligence to the End of his Days, thro' all Trials. In him was to be seen the right Way of be|ing <HI>lively in Religion:</HI> His <HI>Liveliness</HI> in Religion did not consist meerly or mainly in his being lively with the <HI>Tongue,</HI> but in <HI>Deed</HI>; not in being forward in Profession and outward Shew, and abundant in declaring his own Experiences; but chiefly in being active and abundant in the Labours &amp; Duties of Religion; <HI>not slothful in Business,</HI> but <HI>fervent in Spirit, serving the Lord,</HI> and <HI>serving his Generation, according to the Will of God.</HI></P>
<P>By these Things, many high Pretenders to Religion, and Pro|fessors of extraordinary spiritual Experience, may be sensible, that Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> did greatly condemn <HI>their</HI> kind of Religion; and that not only in Word, but by Example, both living and dy|ing; as the whole Series of his Christian Experience and Prac|tice, from his Conversion to his Death, appears a constant Con|demnation of it.</P>
<P>It can't be objected, that the Reason why he so much disliked the Religion of these Pretenders, and why his own so much dif|fered from it, was, that his <HI>Experiences</HI> were not <HI>clear.</HI> There is no Room to say, they were otherwise, in any Respect, in which Clearness of Experience has been wont to be insisted on; whether it be the Clearness of their <HI>Nature,</HI> or of their <HI>Order,</HI> and the Method his Soul was at first brought to Rest and Com|fort in his Conversion. I am far from thinking (and so was he) that Clearness of the <HI>Order</HI> of Experience is, in any Mea|sure, of equal Importance with the Clearness of their <HI>Nature:</HI> I have sufficiently declared in my Discourse on <HI>Religious Affecti|ons</HI> (which he expresly approved of and recommended) that I don't suppose, a sensible Distinctness of the <HI>Steps</HI> of the Spirit's Operation and Method of successive Convictions and Illumina|tions, is a necessary Requisite to Persons being received in full
<PB N="287" REF="006311_0320_0000000000000000">
Charity, as true Saints; provided the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Things they profess, be right, and their Practice agreeable. Neverthe|less, 'tis observable, (which cuts off all Objection from such as would be most unreasonably disposed to object and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avil in the present Case) So it was, that Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Experiences were not only clear in the latter Respect, but remarkably so in the former: So that there is not perhaps one Instance in five Hun|dred true Converts, that on this Account can be parallel'd with him.</P>
<P>It can't be pretended, that the Reason why he so much ab|hor'd and condemned the Notions and Experiences of those whose <HI>first Faith</HI> consists in believing that Christ <HI>is theirs,</HI> and that Christ <HI>died for them</HI>; without any previous Experience of Union of Heart to him, for his Excellency, as he is in himself, and not for his supposed Love to them; and who judge of their Interest in Christ, their Justification, and GOD's Love to them, not by their Sanctification and the Exercises and Fruits of Grace, but by a supposed <HI>immediate</HI> Witness of the Spirit, by inward Suggestion; I say, it can't be pretended, that the Rea|son why he so much detested and condemned such Opinions and Experiences, was, that he was of a too <HI>legal</HI> Spirit; either that he never was dead to the Law, never experienced a thoro' Work of Conviction, was never fully brought off from his own Righteousness, and wean'd from the <HI>old Covenant,</HI> by a thorough <HI>legal</HI> Humiliation; or that afterwards, he had no great De|gree of <HI>evangelical</HI> Humiliation, not living in a deep Sense of his own Emptiness, Wretchedness, Poverty, and absolute De|pendance on the meer Grace of GOD through Christ. For his Convictions of Sin, preceeding his first Consolations in Christ, were exceeding deep and thorough; his Trouble and Exercise of Mind, by a Sense of Sin and Misery, very great and long continued; &amp; the Light let into his Mind at his Conversion and in progressive Sanctification, appears to have had its genuine humbling Influence upon him, to have kept him low in his own Eyes, not confiding in himself, but in Christ, <HI>living by the Faith of the Son of GOD,</HI> and <HI>looking for the Mercy of the Lord Jesus to eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can it be pretended, that the Reason why he condemned those, and other Things, which this Sort of People call the very Height of vital Religion and the Power of Godliness, was, that he was a <HI>dead Christian,</HI> and lived <HI>in the Dark</HI> (as they express themselves) that his Experiences, tho' they might be true, were not great; that he did not live near to GOD, had but a
<PB N="288" REF="006311_0321_0000000000000000">
small Acquaintance with him, and had but a dim Sight of spi|ritual Things. If any, after they have read the preceeding Account of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Life, will venture to pretend thus, they will only shew that <HI>they themselves</HI> are in the <HI>Dark,</HI> and do indeed <HI>put Darkness for Light, and Light for Darkness.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis common with this Sort of People, if there is any one whom they can't deny to exhibit good Evidences of true God|liness, who yet appears to dislike their Notions, &amp; condemn those Things wherein they place the Height of Religion, to insinuate, that <HI>they are afraid of the Cross,</HI> and have a Mind to <HI>curry Fa|vour with the World,</HI> and the like. But I presume, this will not be pretended concerning Mr. <HI>Brainerd,</HI> by any one Person that has read the preceeding Account of his Life. It must needs appear a Thing notorious to such, that he was an extraordinary, and almost unparallel'd Instance (in these Times and these Parts of the World) of the contrary Disposition: and <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> whether we consider what he has recorded of his inward <HI>Ex|perience,</HI> from Time to Time; or his <HI>Practice,</HI> how he in Fact took up and embraced the <HI>Cross,</HI> and bore it constantly, in his great Self-Denials, Labours, and Sufferings for the Name of Jesus, and went on without fainting, without repenting, or repining, to his dying Illness: How he did not only, from Time to Time, relinquish and renounce the <HI>World</HI> secretly, in his Heart, with the full and fervent Consent of all the Powers of his Soul; but openly and actually forsook the <HI>World,</HI> with it's Possessions, Delights, and common Comforts, to dwell as it were with wild Beasts, in a howling Wilderness; with con|stant Chearfulness, complying with the numerous Hardships of a Life of Toil and Travel there, to promote the Kingdom of his dear Redeemer. And besides, it appears by the preceed|ing History, that he never did more condemn the Things fore|mention'd, never had a greater Sense of their Delusion, per|nicious Nature, and ill Tendency, and never was more full of Pity to those that are led away with them, than in his last Illness, and at Times when he had the nearest Prospect of Death, supposed himself to be on the very Brink of Eternity, and looked on all this lower World as what he never should have any Thing more to do with. Surely he did not condemn those Things at these Seasons, only to <HI>curry Favour with the World.</HI></P>
<P>Besides what has been already related of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Sen|timents in his dying State concerning true and false Religion, we have his deliberate and solemn Tho'ts on this Subject, fur|ther appearing by his <HI>Preface</HI> to Mr. <HI>Shepard's</HI> Diary, before
<PB N="289" REF="006311_0322_0000000000000000">
mentioned; which, when he wrote it, he supposed to be (as it proved) one of the <HI>last</HI> Things he should ever write. I shall here insert a Part of that <HI>Preface,</HI> as follows.</P>
<P><Q>How much Stress is laid by many upon some Things as being Effects and Evidences of exalted Degrees of Religion, when they are so far from being of any Importance in it, that they are really irreligious, a Mixture of <HI>Self-Love, Ima|gination,</HI> and spiritual <HI>Pride,</HI> or perhaps the Influence of <HI>Satan</HI> transformed into an Angel of Light; I say, how much Stress is laid on these Things by many, I shall not determine: But 'tis much to be fear'd, that while GOD was carrying on a glorious Work of Grace, and undoubtedly gathering a Harvest of Souls to himself (which we should always re|member with Thankfulness) Numbers of others have at the same Time been fatally deluded by the Devices of the Devil, and their own corrupt Hearts. It is to be fear'd, that the <HI>Conversions</HI> of some have no better Foundation than this; <HI>viz.</HI> That after they have been under some Concern for their Souls for a while, and it may be manifested some very great and uncommon Distress and Agonies, they have on a sudden <HI>imagined they saw</HI> CHRIST, in some Posture or other; perhaps on the Cross, bleeding and dying for their Sins; or it may be, smiling on them, and thereby signify|ing his Love to them: And that these and the like Things, tho' meer Imaginations, which have nothing Spiritual in them, have instantly removed all their Fears and Distresses, fill'd them with Raptures of Joy, and made them imagine, that they loved Christ with all their Hearts; when the Bot|tom of all was Nothing but <HI>Self-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> For when they ima|gined that Christ had been so good to them as to save them, and as it were to single them out of all the World, they could not but feel some kind of natural Gratitude to him; altho' they never had any spiritual View of his divine Glory, Excellency and Beauty, and consequently never had any Love to him for himself. Or that instead of having some such imaginary View of Christ as has been mention'd, in order to remove their Distress and give them Joy, some having had a Passage, or perhaps many Passages of <HI>Scripture</HI> brought to their Minds <HI>with Power</HI> (as they express it) such as that, <HI>Son, be of good Chear, thy Sins are forgiven thee,</HI> and the like, they have immediately applied these Passages to <HI>themselves,</HI> supposing that God hereby manifested his peculiar Favour to <HI>them,</HI> as if mention'd by Name: Never

considering, that they are now giving H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d to new Reve|lations; there being no such Thing reveal'd in the Word of God, as that <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that</HI> particular Person has, or ever shall have his Sins forgiven; nor yet remembring, that <HI>Sa|tan</HI> can, with a great deal of seeming Pertinency (and per|haps also with considerable Power) bring Scripture to the Minds of Men, as he did to Christ himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. And thus th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se rejoyce upon having some Scripture suddenly suggested to them, or impress'd upon their Minds, supposing they are now the Children of God, just as did the other upon their imaginary Views of Christ. And 'tis said, that some speak of seeing a great <HI>Light,</HI> which fill'd all the Place where they were, and dispel'd all their Darkness, Fears and Distresses, and almost ravish'd their Souls. While others have had it warmly suggested to their Minds, not by any Passage of Scripture, but as it were by a <HI>Whisper</HI> or Voice from Hea|ven, <HI>That God loves them, that Christ is theirs,</HI> &amp;c. which groundless Imaginations and Suggestion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> have had the same Effect upon them, that the Delusions before men|tion'd had on the others.&mdash;And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is the Conversion of this Sort of Persons, so are their <HI>After-Experience<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>; the whole being built upon Imagination, strong Impression, and sudden Suggestions made to their Minds: Whence they are usually extreme confident (as if immediately informed from God) not only of the Goodness of their own State, but of their infallible Knowledge, and absolute Certainty, of the Truth of every Thing they pretend to, under the No|tion of Religion; and thus all Reasoning with some of them is utterly excluded.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But 'tis remarkable of these, that they are <HI>extremely defi|cient</HI> in Regard of true Poverty of Spirit, Sense of exceeding Vileness in themselves, such as frequently makes truly gra|cious Souls to <HI>gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n, being burden'd</HI>; as also in Regard of Meekness, Love and Gentleness towards Mankind, Ten|derness of Conscience in their ordinary Affairs and Dealings in the World. And 'tis rare to see 'em deeply concerned about the Principles and Ends of their Actions, and under Fears lest they should not eye the Glory of God chiefly, but live to themselves; or this at least is the Case in their ordinary Conduct, whether civil or religious. But if any one of their particular <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> which their Zeal has espoused, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e attack'd, they are then so conscientious, they must <HI>born,</HI> if call'd to it, for the Defence of it. Yet, at the same Time,

when they are so <HI>extremely def<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cient</HI> in Regard of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se preci|ous <HI>divine Tempers</HI> which have been mention'd, they are usually full of <HI>Zeal,</HI> Concern and Fervency in the Things of Religion, and often <HI>discourse</HI> of them with much Warmth and Engagement: And to those who don't know, or don't consider, wherein the <HI>Essence</HI> of true Religion consists, <HI>viz.</HI> in being <HI>conformed to the Image of Christ,</HI> not in Point of Zeal and Fervency only, but in all divine Tempers and Practices; I say, to those who don't duly observe and dis|tinguish, they often appear like the best of Men.</Q></P>

<P><PB N="292" REF="006311_0325_0000000000000000">It cannot be pretended by these Men, that Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> condemned their Religion, only because he was <HI>not acquainted with them,</HI> and had not Opportunity for full Observation of the Nature, Operation &amp; Tendency of their <HI>Experiences</HI>: For he had abundant and peculiar Opportunities of such Observation and Acquaintance: He lived <HI>through</HI> the late extraordinary Time of religious Commotion, and saw the Beginning and End, the Good and the Bad of it: He had Opportunity to see the vari|ous Operations and Effects, that were wrought in this Season, more <HI>extensively,</HI> than any Person I know of: His native Place was about the middle of <HI>Connecticut</HI>; and he was much con|versant in all Parts of that Colony: He was conversant in the Eastern Parts of it, after the Religion, which he condemned, began much to prevail there: He was conversant with the zealous People on <HI>Long-Island,</HI> from one End of the Island to the other; and also in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> and <HI>Pennsylvania</HI>; with Peo|ple of various Nations: He had some special Opportunities in some Places in this Province (<HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI>) where has been very much of this Sort of Religion, and at a Time when it gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tly prevailed: He had conversed &amp; disputed with Abun|dance of this Kind of People in various Parts, as he told me; and also informed me, that he had seen something of the same Appearances in some of the <HI>Indians,</HI> whom he had preached to, and had Opportunity to see the Beginning and End of them. And besides, Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> could speak more feelingly and un|derstandingly concerning these Things, because there was once a Time when he was drawn away into an Esteem of them, and for a short Season had united himself to this Kind of People, and partook, in some Respects, of their Spirit and Behaviour.</P>
<P>But I proceed to another Observation on the foregoing Memoirs.</P>
<P N="2">II. This History of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s may help us to make <HI>Distinctions</HI> among the high religious <HI>Affections,</HI> and remarkable <HI>Impressions</HI> made on the Minds of Persons, in a Time of great <HI>Awakening,</HI> and <HI>Revival of Religion</HI>; and may convince us, that there are not only Distinctions in <HI>Theory,</HI> invented to save the Credit of pretended Revivals of Religion, and what is called <HI>the Experience of the Operations of the Spirit</HI>; but Distinctions that do actually take Place in the Course of <HI>Events,</HI> and have a real and evident Foundation in <HI>Fact.</HI></P>
<P>Many <HI>do</HI> and <HI>will</HI> confound Things, blend all together, and say, <HI>'Tis all alike; 'tis all of the same Sort.</HI> So there are many
<PB N="293" REF="006311_0326_0000000000000000">
that say concerning the Religion most generally prevailing among the <HI>Separatists,</HI> and the Affections they manifest, <HI>'Tis the same that was all over the Land seven Years ago.</HI> And some that have read Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Journal, giving an Account of the extraordinary Things that have come to pass among the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> say, <HI>'Tis evidently the same Thing that appeared in many Places amongst the</HI> English, <HI>which has now proved naught, and come to that which is worse than nothing.</HI> And all the Reason they have thus to determine all to be <HI>the same Work,</HI> and <HI>the same Spirit,</HI> is, that the one manifested high Affections, and so do the other; the great Affections of the one had some Influence on their Bodies, and so have the other; the one use the Terms <HI>Conviction, Conversion, Humiliation, Coming to Christ, Discoveries, Experiences,</HI> &amp;c. and so do the other; the Impressions on the one are attended with a great deal of Zeal, and so it in with the other; the Affections of the one dispose 'em to speak much about Things of Religion, and so do the other; the one delight much in religious Meetings, and so do the other.&mdash; The Agreement, that appears in these, and such like Things, make 'em conclude, that surely all is alike, all is the same Work. Whereas, on a closer Inspection &amp; critical Examination, it would appear, that notwithstanding an Agreement in such Circum|stances, yet indeed there is a vast Difference, both in <HI>Essence</HI> and <HI>Fruits.</HI> A considerable Part of the religious Operations, that were six or seven Years ago, especially towards the latter Part of that extraordinary Season, was doubtless of the same Sort with the Religion of the <HI>Separatists</HI>; but not all: There were many, whose Experiences were, like Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s, in a Judg|ment of Charity, genuine and incontestible.</P>
<P>Not only do the Opposers of all Religion consisting in power|ful Operations and Affections, thus confound Things; but many of the <HI>Pretenders</HI> to <HI>such</HI> Religion do so. They that have been the Subjects of some sort of vehement, but vain Operations on their Mind, when they hear the Relation of the Experi|ences of some real and eminent Christians, they say, Their Ex|periences are of the same sort: So they say, they are just like the Experiences of eminent Christians in former Times, which we have printed Accounts of. So, I doubt not, but there are many deluded People, if they should read the preceeding Ac|count of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Life, who reading without much Un|derstanding, or careful Observati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, would say, without Hesi|tation, that some Things which they have met with, are of the very same Kind with what he expresses: When the Agreement
<PB N="294" REF="006311_0327_0000000000000000">
is only in some general Circumstances, or some particular Things that are superficial, and belonging as it were to the Profession and Out-side of Religion; but the inward Temper of Mind and the Fruits in Practice, are as opposite and distant as East and West.</P>
<P>Many <HI>honest good</HI> People also, and <HI>true Christians,</HI> don't very well know how to make a Difference. The glistering Appear|ance and glaring Show of false Religion dazzles their Eyes; and they sometimes are so deluded by it, that they look on some of these Impressions, which Hypocrites tell of, as the brightest Experiences. And tho' they have experienced no such Things themselves, they think, it is because they are vastly lower in Attainments, and but Babes, in Comparison of these flaming Christians. Yes, sometimes from their differing so much from those who make so great a Show, they doubt whe|ther they have any Grace at all. And it is a hard Thing, to bring many well-meaning People to make proper Distinctions in this Case; and especially to maintain and stand by 'em; through a certain Weakness they unhapply labour of, whereby they are liable to be overcome with the Glare of outward Appearances. Thus, if in a sedate Hour they are by Reasoning brought to allow such and such Distinctions, yet the next Time they come in the Way of the great Show of false Religion, the dazzling Appearance swallows them up, and they are carried away. Thus the Devil, by his cunning Artifices, easily dazzles the feeble Sight of Men, and puts 'em beyond a Capacity of a proper Exercise of Consideration, or hearkning to the Dictates of calm Thought &amp; cool Understand|ing. When they perceive the great Affection, earnest Talk, strong Voice, assured Looks, vast Confidence, and bold Asserti|ons, of these empty assuming Pretenders, they are over-born, lose the Possession of their Judgment, and say, <HI>Surely these Men are in the Right, God is with 'em of a Truth:</HI> and so they are carried away, not with Light and Reason, but (like Chil|dren) as it were with a strong Wind.</P>
<P>This confounding all Things together, that have a fair Shew, is but acting the Part of a Child, that going into a Shop, where a variety of Wares are exposed to Sale (all of a shining Ap|pearance; some Vessels of Gold and Silver, and some Diamonds and other precious Stones; and other Things that are Toys of little Value; which are of some base Metal gilt, or Glass po|lished, and painted with curious Colours, or cut like Diamonds) should esteem all alike, and give as great a Price for the vile as
<PB N="295" REF="006311_0328_0000000000000000">
for the precious: Or 'tis like the Conduct of some unskilful rash Person, who finding himself deceived by some of the Wares he had bought at that Shop, should at once conclude, all he there saw was of no Value; and pursuant to such a Conclusion, when afterwards he has true Gold and Diamonds offered him, enough to enrich him and enable him to live like a Prince all his Days, he should throw it all into the Sea.</P>
<P>But we <HI>must</HI> get into another Way. The want of distin|guishing in Things that appertain to experimental Religion, is one of the chief Miseries of the professing World. 'Tis at|tended with very many most dismal Consequences: Multi|tudes of Souls are fatally deluded about themselves, and their own State; and so are eternally undone: Hypocrites are con|firmed in their Delusions, and exceedingly puffed up with Pride: Many sincere Christians are dreadfully perplexed, darkened, tempted, and drawn aside from the Way of Duty; and sometimes sadly tainted with false Religion, to the great Dishonour of Christianity, and Hurt of their own Souls: some of the most dangerous and pernicious Enemies of Religion in the World (tho' called bright Christians) are encouraged and honoured; who ought to be discountenanced and shun'd by every Body: And Prejudices are begotten and confirmed in vast Multitudes, against every Thing wherein the Power and Essence of Godliness consists; and in the End Deism &amp; Atheism are promoted.</P>
<P N="3">III. The foregoing Account of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Life may afford Matter of Conviction, that there is indeed such a Thing as true <HI>experimental Religion,</HI> arising from immediate divine Influences, supernaturally enlightning and convincing the Mind, and powerfully impressing, quickening, sanctifying, and go|verning the Heart; which Religion is indeed an amiable Thing, of happy Tendency, and of no hurtful Consequence to human <HI>Society</HI>; notwithstanding there having been so many Pretences and Appearances of what is called experimental vital Re|ligion, that have proved to be nothing but vain, pernicious <HI>Enthusiasm.</HI></P>
<P>If any insist, that Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Religion was <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> and nothing but a strange Heat and blind Fervour of Mind, arising from the strong Fancies and Dreams of a notional whimsical Brain; I would ask, if it be so, that such Things as these are the Fruits of Enthusiasm, <HI>viz.</HI> a great Degree of Honesty and Simplicity, sincere and earnest Desires and Endea|vours,
<PB N="296" REF="006311_0329_0000000000000000">
to know and do whatever is right, and to avoid every Thing that is wrong; an high Degree of Love to God, De|light in the Perfections of his Nature, placing the Happiness of Life in him; not only in contemplating him, but in being active in pleasing and serving him; a firm and undoubting Belief in the <HI>Messiah,</HI> as the Saviour of the World, the great Prophet of God, and King of God's Church; together with great Love to him, Delight and Complacence in the Way of Salvation by him, and longing for the Enlargement of his King|dom; earnest Desires that GOD may be glorified and the <HI>Messiah</HI>'s Kingdom advanced, whatever Instruments are made use of; uncommon Resignation to the Will of God, and that under vast Trials; great and universal Benevolence to Man|kind, reaching all Sorts of Persons without Distinction, mani|fested in Sweetness of Speech and Behaviour, kind Treatment, Mercy, Liberality, and earnest seeking the Good of the Souls and Bodies of Men; attended with extraordinary Humility, Meekness, Forgiveness of Injuries, and Love to Enemies; and a great Abhorrence of a contrary Spirit and Practice; not only as appearing in others, but whereinsoever it had appeared in himself; causing the most bitter Repentance, and Brokenness of Heart on Account of any past Instances of such a Conduct: A modest, discreet &amp; decent Deportment, among Superiours, Inferiours and Equals; a most diligent Improvement of Time, and earnest Care to lose no Part of it; great Watchfulness against all Sorts of Sin, of Heart, Speech, and Action: And this Example and these Endeavours attended with most happy Fruits, and blessed Effects on others, in humanizing, civilizing, and wonderfully reforming and transforming some of the most brutish Savages; Idle, Immoral, Drunkards, Murderers, gross Idolaters, and Wizards; bringing them to permanent Sobriety, Diligence, Devotion, Honesty, Conscientiousness, and Charity: And the foregoing amiable Virtues and successful Labours all ending at last in a marvellous Peace, unmoveable Stability, Calm|ness, and Resignation, in the sensible Approaches of Death; with Longing for the Heavenly State; not only for the Honours and circumstantial Advantages of it, but above all for the moral Perfection, and holy and blessed Employments of it: And these Things in a Person indisputably of good Understanding and Judgment: I say, if all these Things are the Fruits of <HI>Enthu|siasm,</HI> why should not <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> be thought a desirable and excellent Thing? For what can true Religion, what can the best Philosophy do more? If Vapours and Whimsy will bring
<PB N="297" REF="006311_0330_0000000000000000">
Men to the most thorough Virtue, to the most benign and fruitful Morality; and will maintain it through a Course of Life (attended with many Trials) without Affectation or Self-Ex|altation, and with an earnest constant bearing Testimony against the Wildness, the Extravagances, the bitter Zeal, assuming Behaviour, &amp; separating Spirit of Enthusiasts; &amp; will do all this more effectually, than any Thing else has ever done in any plain known Instance that can be produced; if it be so, I say, what Cause then has the World to prize and pray for this blessed Whimsicalness, and these benign Sort of Vapours?</P>
<P>It would perhaps be a Prejudice with some against the whole of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Religion, if it had begun in the Time of the <HI>late religious Commotion</HI>; being ready to conclude (how|ever unreasonably) that nothing Good could take it's Rise from those Times. But it was not so; his Conversion was <HI>before</HI> those Times, in a Time of general Deadness (as has been before observed) and therefore at a Season when it was impossible, that he should receive a Taint from any corrupt Notions, E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mples, or Customs, that had Birth in those Times.</P>
<P>And whereas there are many who are not professed Opposers of what is called <HI>experimental Religion,</HI> who yet doubt of the Re|ality of it, from the <HI>bad Lives</HI> of some Professors; and are ready to determine that there is nothing in all the Talk about being <HI>born again,</HI> being <HI>emptied of Self, brought to a saving Close with Christ,</HI> &amp;c. because many that pretend to these Things, and are thought by others to have been the Subjects of 'em, manifest no abiding Alteration in their moral Disposition and Behaviour; are as careless, carnal, coveteous, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as ever; yea, some much worse than ever: It is to be acknowledg'd and lamented, that this is the Case with some; but by the preceeding Account they may be sensible, that it is not so with all. There are some indisputable Instances of such a Change, as the Scripture speaks of; an abiding great Change, a <HI>Renovation of the Spirit of the Mind,</HI> and a <HI>Walking in Newness of Life.</HI> In the foregoing Instance particularly, they may see the abiding Influence of such a Work of Conversion, as they have heard of from the Word of GOD; the Fruits of such Experiences through a Course of Years; under a great Variety of Circumstances, many Changes of State, Place, and Company; and may see the blessed Issue and Event of it in Life and Death.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The preceeding History serves to confirm those Doctrines usually called <HI>the Doctrines of Grace.</HI> For if it be allowed
<PB N="298" REF="006311_0331_0000000000000000">
that there is Truth, Substance, or Value in the main of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Religion, it will undoubtedly follow, that those Doc|trines are divine: Since 'tis evident, that the whole of it, from Beginning to End, is according to that Scheme of Things; all built on those Apprehensions, Notions, and Views, that are produced and established in the Mind by those Doctrines. He was brought by Doctrines of this Kind, to his Awakening, and deep Concern about Things of a spiritual and eternal Nature; and by these Doctrines his Convictions were maintained and carried on; and his Conversion was evidently altogether agree|able to this Scheme, but by no Means agreeing with the con|trary; and utterly inconsistent with the <HI>Arminian</HI> Notion of Conversion or Repentance. His Conversion was plainly found|ed in a clear strong Conviction, and undoubting Perswasion of the Truth of those Things appertaining to these Doctrines, which <HI>Arminians</HI> most object against, and which his own Mind had contended most about. And his Conversion was no con|firming and perfecting of moral Principles and Habits, by Use and Practice, and his own Labour in an industrious disciplin|ing himself, together with the concurring Suggestions and con|spiring Aids of GOD's Spirit: But entirely a supernatural Work, at once turning him from Darkness to marvellous Light, and from the Power of Sin to the Dominion of divine and holy Principles; an Effect, in no Regard produced by <HI>his</HI> Strength or Labour, or obtained by <HI>his</HI> Vertue; and not accomplish'd 'till he was first brought to a full Conviction that all his own Vertue, Strength, Labours, and Endeavours could never avail any Thing to the producing or procuring this Effect.</P>
<P>A very little while before, his Mind was full of the same Cavils against the Doctrines of GOD's Sovereign Grace, which are made by <HI>Arminians</HI>; And his Heart full even of a raging Opposition to 'em. And GOD was pleased to perform this good Work in him just after a full End had been put to this Cavilling and Opposition; after he was entirely convinced, that he was dead in Sin, and was in the Hands of GOD, as the absolutely sove|reign, unobliged, sole Disposer and Author of true Holiness. GOD's shewing him Mercy at such a Time, is a Confirmation, that this was a Preparation for Mercy; &amp; consequently, that these Things which he was convinced of, were true: While he op|posed these Things, he was the Subject of no such Mercy; tho' he so earnestly sought it, and prayed for it with so much Painfulness, Care and Strictness in Religion: But when once his Opposition is fully subdued, and he is brought to submit to
<PB N="299" REF="006311_0332_0000000000000000">
the Truths, which he before had opposed, with full Conviction, then the Mercy he sought for is granted, with abundant Light, great Evidence and exceeding Joy, and he reaps the sweet Fruit of it all his Life after, &amp; in the Valley of the Shadow of Death.</P>
<P>In his Conversion, he was brought to see the Glory of that Way of Salvation by Christ, that is taught in what are called the <HI>Doctrines of Grace</HI>; and thence-forward, with unspeakable Joy and Complacence, to embrace and acquiesce in that Way of Salvation. He was in his Conversion, in all Respects, bro't to those Views, and that State of Mind, which these Doctrines shew to be necessary. And if his Conversion was any real Con|version, or any Thing besides a meer Whim, and if the Reli|gion of his Life was any Thing else but a Series of Freaks of a whimsical Mind, then this one grand Principle, on which de|pends the whole Difference between <HI>Calvinists</HI> and <HI>Arminians,</HI> is undeniable, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Grace or Vertue of truly good Men, not only differs from the Vertue of others <HI>in Degree,</HI> but even <HI>in Nature and Kind.</HI> If ever Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> was truly turned from Sin to GOD at all, or ever became truly Religi|ous, none can reasonably doubt but that his Conversion was at the Time when he supposed it to be: The Change he then experienced, was evidently the greatest moral Change, that ever he pass'd under; and he was then apparently first brought to that Kind of Religion, that remarkable new Habit and Temper of Mind, which he held all his Life after. The Narration shews it to be different, <HI>in Nature and Kind,</HI> from all that ever he was the Subject of before. It was evidently wrought at once, without fitting and preparing his Mind, by gradually con|vincing it more and more of the same Truths, and bringing it nearer and nearer to such a Temper: For it was soon after his Mind had been remarkably full of Blasphemy, and a vehement Exercise of sensible Enmity against God, and great Opposition to those Truths, which he was now brought with his whole Soul to embrace, and rest in, as divine and glorious, and to place his Happiness in the Contemplation and Improvement of. And he himself (who was surely best able to judge) declares, that the Dispositions and Affections, which were then given him, and thence-forward maintained in him, were most sensibly and certainly, perfectly different, <HI>in their Nature,</HI> from all that ever he was the Subject of before, or that he ever had any Con|ception of. This he ever stood to &amp; was peremptory in (as what he certainly knew) even to his Death. He must be looked upon as capable of judging; he had Opportunity to know: He had
<PB N="300" REF="006311_0333_0000000000000000">
practised a great deal of Religion before, was exceeding strict and conscientious, and had continued so for a long Time; had various religious Affections, with which he often flattered himself, and sometimes pleased himself as being now in a good Estate: And after he had those new Experiences, that began in his Conversion, they were continued to the End of his Life; long enough for him thoroughly to observe their Nature, and compare 'em with what had been before. Doubtless he was <HI>compos mentis</HI>; and was at least one of so good an Understand|ing and Judgment, as to be pretty well capable of discerning and comparing the Things that passed in his own Mind.</P>
<P>'Tis further observable, that his Religion all along operated in such a Manner as tended to confirm his Mind in the Doctrines of God's absolute Sovereignty, Man's universal and intire De|pendance on God's Power and Grace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The more his Re|ligion prevailed in his Heart, and the fuller he was of divine Love, and of clear and delightful Views of spiritual Things, and the more his Heart was engaged in God's Service; the more sensible he was of the Certainty and the Excellency and Impor|tance of these Truths, and the more he was affected with them and rejoyced in them. And he declares particularly, that when he lay for a long while on the Verge of the eternal World, often expecting to be in that World in a few Minutes, yet at the same Time enjoying great Serenity of Mind, and Clearness of Thought, and being most apparently in a peculiar Manner at a Distance from an enthusiastical Frame, he <HI>at that Time saw clearly the Truth of those great Doctrines of the Gospel, which are justly stiled</HI> the Doctrines of Grace, <HI>and never felt himself so capable of demonstrating the Truth of them.</HI></P>
<P>So that 'tis very evident, Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Religion was wholly correspondent to what is called the <HI>Calvinistical Scheme,</HI> and was the Effect of those Doctrines applied to his Heart: And certainly it cannot be denied, that the Effect was good, unless we turn Atheists, or Deists.&mdash; I would ask, whether there be any such Thing, in Reality, as <HI>Christian Devotion?</HI>&mdash; If there be, what is it? What is its Nature? And what its just Measure? Should it not be in a great Degree? We read abundantly in Scripture, of <HI>loving God with all the Heart, with all the Soul, with all the Mind, and with all the Strength,</HI> of <HI>De|lighting in God,</HI> of <HI>Rejoycing in the Lord, Rejoycing with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory, the Soul's Magnifying the Lord, Thirsting for God, Hungring and Thirsting after Righteousness, the Soul's breaking for the Longing it hath to God's Judgments,
<PB N="301" REF="006311_0334_0000000000000000">
Praying to God with Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anings that cannot be uttered, Mourning for Sin with a broken Heart and contrite Spirit,</HI> &amp;c. How full is the Book of Psalms, and other Parts of Scripture, of such Things as these! Now wherein do these Things, as express'd by and appearing in Mr. <HI>Brainerd,</HI> either the Things themselves, or their Effects and Fruits, differ from the Scripture-Repre|sentations? These Things he was brought to by that strange and wonderful Transformation of the Man, which he called his <HI>Conversion.</HI> And don't this well agree with what is so often said, in Old Testament and New, concerning the <HI>giving of a new Heart, creating a right Spirit, a being renewed in the Spi|rit of the Mind, a being sanctified throughout, becoming a new Creature,</HI> &amp;c? Now where is there to be found an <HI>Arminian</HI> Conversion or Repentance, consisting in so great and admirable a Change? Can the <HI>Arminians</HI> produce an Instance, within this Age, and so, plainly, within our Reach and View, of such a Reformation, such a Transformation of a Man, to Scriptural Devotion, Heavenly-Mindedness, and true Christian Morality, in one that before lived without these Things, on the Foot of <HI>their</HI> Principles, and through the Influence of their Doctrines?</P>
<P>And here, is worthy to be considered, not only the Effect of <HI>Calvinistical</HI> Doctrines (as they are called) on Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> himself, but also the Effect of the same Doctrines, as taught and inculcated by him, on <HI>others.</HI> 'Tis abundantly pretended and asserted of late, that these Doctrines tend to undermine the very Foundations of all Religion and Morality, and to en|ervate and vacate all reasonable Motives to the Exercise and Practice of them, and lay invincible Stumbling-Blocks be|fore <HI>Infidels,</HI> to hinder their embracing Christianity; and that the contrary Doctrines are the fruitful Principles of Virtue and Goodness, set Religion on it's right Basis, represent it in an amiable Light, give it's Motives their full Force, and recom|mend it to the Reason and common Sense of Mankind.&mdash; But where can they find an Instance of so great and signal an Effect of their Doctrines, in bringing <HI>Infidels,</HI> who were at such a Distance from all that is Civil, Human, Sober, Rational, and Christian, and so full of inveterate Prejudices against these Things, to such a Degree of Humanity, Civility, Exercise of Reason, Self-denial, and Christian Vertue? <HI>Arminians</HI> place Religion in <HI>Morality</HI>: Let them bring an Instance of their Doctrines producing such a Transformation of a People in Point of <HI>Morality.</HI> 'Tis strange, if the Alwise God so orders Things in his Providence, that reasonable and proper <HI>Means,</HI> and <HI>his
<PB N="302" REF="006311_0335_0000000000000000">
own</HI> Means, which he himself has appointed, should in no known remarkable Instance be instrumental to produce so good an Ef|fect; an Effect so agreable to his own Word &amp; Mind, and that very Effect for which he appointed these excellent Means; that they should not be so Successful, as those Means which are <HI>not</HI> his own, but very contrary to 'em, and of a contrary Tendency; Means that are in themselves very absurd, and tend to root all Religion and Vertue out of the World, to promote and esta|blish Infidelity, and to lay an insuperable Stumbling-Block be|fore <HI>Pagans,</HI> to hinder their embracing the Gospel: I say, if this be the true State of the Case, 'tis certainly pretty won|derful, and an Event worthy of some Attention.</P>
<P>I know, that many will be ready to say, <HI>It is too soon yet, to glory in the Work, that has been wro't among Mr.</HI> Brainerd's <HI>Indians; 'Tis best to wait and see the final Event; It may be, all will come to nothing by and by</HI>; To which I answer (not to insist, that it will not follow, according to <HI>Arminian</HI> Principles, they are not now true Christians, really pious &amp; godly, tho' they <HI>should</HI> fall away and come to nothing) that I never supposed, every one of those <HI>Indians,</HI> who in Profession renounced their Heathenism &amp; visibly embraced Christianity, and have had some Appearance of Piety, will finally prove true Converts: If two thirds, or in|deed one half of 'em (as great a Proportion as there is in the Parable of the <HI>Ten Virgins</HI>) should persevere; it will be suffici|ent to shew the Work, wrought among them, to have been truly admirable and glorious. But so much of Permanence of their Religion has already appeared, as shews it to be something else besides an <HI>Indian</HI> Humour or good Mood, or any transient Effect in the Conceits, Notions, and Affections of these igno|rant People, excited at a particular Turn, by artful Manage|ment. For 'tis now more than <HI>three Years</HI> ago, that this Work began among them, and a remarkable Change appear'd in many of them; since which Time the Number of visible Converts has greatly increased: And by repeated Accounts, from seve|ral Hands, they still generally persevere in diligent Religion and strict Vertue. I think worthy to be here inserted, a <HI>Letter</HI> from a young Gentleman, a Candidate for the Ministry, one of those before mentioned, appointed by the honourable Commissioners in <HI>Boston,</HI> as Missionaries to the Heathen of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> so called; who, by their Order, dwelt with Mr. <HI>John Brainerd,</HI> among these Christian <HI>Indians,</HI> in order to their being prepared for the Business of their Mission.

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Bethel,</HI> in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI>
<DATE>Jan. 14. 1747, 8.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Honoured and dear Parents,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFter a long and uncomfortable Journey, by Reason of bad Weather, I arrived at Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s, the 6th of this Instant; where I design to stay this Winter: And as yet, upon many Accounts, am well satisfied with my coming hither. The State and Circumstances of the <HI>In|dians,</HI> spiritual and temporal, much exceed what I expected. I have endeavoured to acquaint my self with the State of the <HI>Indians</HI> in general, with particular Persons, and with the School; as much as the short Time I have been here would admit of. And notwithstanding my Expectations were very much raised, from Mr. <HI>David Brainerd</HI>'s Jour|nal, and from particular Informations from him; yet I must confess, that in many Respects, they are not equal to that which now appears to me to be true, concerning the glorious Work of divine Grace amongst the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>The Evening after I came to Town, I had Opportunity to see the <HI>Indians</HI> together, whilst the Rev. Mr. <HI>Arthur</HI> preach'd to them: At which Time there appeared a very general and uncommon Seriousness and Solemnity in the Congregation: And this appear'd to me to be the Effect of an inward Sense of the Importance of divine Truths, and not because they were hearing a Stranger: Which was abundantly confirmed to me the next Sabbath, when there was the same devout Attendance on divine Service, and a surprizing Solemnity appearing in the Performance of each Part of divine Worship. And some, who are hopefully true Christians, appear to have been at that Time much enliven'd and comforted; not from any observable Commotions then, but from Conversation afterwards: And others seem'd to be under pressing Concern for their Souls. I have endea|voured to acquaint my self with particular Persons; many of whom seem to be very humble and growing Christians; altho' some of them (as I am informed) were before their Conversion most monstrously Wicked.</P>
<P>Religious Conversation seems to be very pleasing and delightful to many, and especially that which relates to the Exercises of the Heart. And many here don't seem to be real Christians only, but growing Christians also; as well in doctrinal, as experimental Knowledge. Besides my Conversation with particular Persons, I have had Oppor|tunity to attend upon one of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s catechetical
<PB N="304" REF="006311_0337_0000000000000000">
Lectures; where I was surprized at their Readiness in answering Questions which they had not been used to: Altho' Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> complained much of their uncommon Deficiency. It is surprizing, to see this People, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o not long since were led Captive by <HI>Satan</HI> at his Will, and liv|ing in the Practice of all manner of Abominations, with|out the least Sense even of moral Honesty, yet now living soberly and regularly, and not seeking every Man his own, but every Man, in some Sense, his Neighbour's Good; and to see those, who but a little while past, knew nothing of the true GOD, now worshipping Him in a solemn and devout Manner; not only in publick, but in their Fami|lies and in Secret; which is manifestly the Case; it being a difficult Thing to walk out in the Woods in the Morn|ing, without disturbing Persons at their secret Devotion. And it seems wonderful, that this should be the Case, not only with adult Persons, but with Children also. It is ob|servable here, that many Children (if not the Children in general) retire into secret Places to pray. And, as far as at present I can judge, this is not the Effect of Custom and Fashion, but of real Seriousness and Thoughtfulness about their Souls.</P>
<P>I have frequently gone into the <HI>School,</HI> and have spent considerable Time there amongst the Children; and have been surprized to see, not only their diligent Attendance upon the Business of the School, but also the Proficiency they have made in it, in Reading and Writing, and in their Ca|techisms of divers Sorts. It seems to be as pleasing and as natural to these Children, to have their <HI>Books</HI> in their Hands, as it does for many others to be at <HI>Play.</HI> I have gone into an House where there has been a Number of Children ac|cidentally gathered together; and observed, that every one had his Book in his Hand, and was diligently studying of it. There is to the Number of about thirty of these Chil|dren, who can answer to all the Questions in the <HI>Assem|bly</HI>'s <HI>Catechism</HI>; and the bigger Part of them are able to do it with the <HI>Proofs,</HI> to the fourth Commandment. I wish there were many such Schools: I confess, that I never was acquainted with such an one, in many Respects. Oh that what God has done here, may prove to be the Beginning of a far more glorious and extensive Work of Grace among the Heathen.</P>

<P>Since this, we have had Accounts from Time to T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me, and some very late, which shew that Religion still continues in prosperous and most desirable Circumstances among these <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. Is there not much in the preceeding Memoirs of Mr. <HI>Brai|nerd</HI> to teach, and excite to Duty, us who are called to the Work of the <HI>Ministry,</HI> and all that are <HI>Candidates</HI> for that great Work? What a deep Sense did he seem to have of the Greatness and Importance of that Work, and with what Weight did it lie on his Mind! How sensible was he of his own Insufficiency for this Work; and how great was his Dependance on God's Sufficiency! How solicitous, that he might be fitted for it! And to this End, how much Time did he spend in Prayer and Fasting, as well as Reading and Meditation; <HI>giving himself to these Things!</HI> How did he dedicate his whole Life, all his Powers and Talents to GOD; and forsake and renounce the World, with all it's pleasing and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nsnaring Enjoyments, that he might be wholly at Liberty, to serve Christ in this Work; and to <HI>please him who had chosen him to be a Soldier,</HI> under <HI>the Captain of our Salvation!</HI> With what Solicitude, Solemnity, and Diligence did he devote himself to God our Saviour, and seek his Presence and Blessing in secret, at the Time of his <HI>Ordination!</HI> And how did his whole Heart appear to be con|stantly engaged, his whole Time employed, and his whole Strength spent in the Business he then solemnly undertook and was publickly set apart to! &mdash; And his History shews us the right Way to <HI>Success</HI> in the Work of the Ministry. He fought it, as a resolute Soldier seeks Victory, in a Siege or Battle; or as a Man that runs a Race, for a great Prize. Animated with Love to Christ and Souls, how did he <HI>labour always fervently,</HI> not only in Word and Doctrine, in publick and private, but in <HI>Prayers</HI> Day and Night, <HI>wrestling with God</HI> in secret, and <HI>travailing</HI> in <HI>Birth,</HI> with unutterable Groans and Agonies, <HI>un|til Christ were formed</HI> in the Hearts of the People to

whom he was sent! How did he thirst for a Blessing on his Ministry; and <HI>watch for Souls, as one that must give Account!</HI> How did he <HI>go forth in the Strength of the Lord God</HI>; seeking and depending on a special Influence of the <HI>Spirit</HI> to assist and succeed him! And what was the happy Fruit at last, though after long waiting, and many dark and discouraging Appear|ances! Like a true Son of <HI>Jacob,</HI> he persevered in wrestling, through all the Darkness of the Night, until the breaking of the Day.</P>
<P>And his Example of labouring, praying, denying himself, and enduring Hardness, with unfainting Resolution and Patience, and his faithful, vigilent, and prudent Conduct in many other Respects (which it would be too long now particularly to re|cite) may afford Instruction to <HI>Missionaries</HI> in particular.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The foregoing Account of Mr. <HI>Brainerd's</HI> Life may afford Instruction to <HI>Christians in general</HI>; as it shews, in many Respects, the right Way of <HI>practising</HI> Religion, in order to obtainin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>Ends</HI> of it, and receiving the <HI>Benefits</HI> of it; or how Christians should <HI>run the Race, set before them,</HI> if they would no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n in vain,</HI> or <HI>run as uncertainly,</HI> but would ho|nour God in the World, adorn their Profession, be Service|able to Mankind, have the Comforts of Religion while they live, be free from disquieting Doubts and dark Appre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ensions about the State of their Souls; enjoy Peace in the Approaches of Death, and <HI>finish their Course with Joy.</HI>&mdash; In general, he much recommended, for this Purpose, the <HI>Redemption of Time,</HI> great <HI>Diligence</HI> in the Business of the Christian Life, <HI>Watchful|ness,</HI> &amp;c. And he very remarkably exemplify'd these Things.</P>
<P>But particularly, his Example and Success with Regard to one Duty in special, may be of great Use to both Ministers and private Christians; I mean, the Duty of <HI>secret Fasting.</HI> The Reader has seen, how much Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> recommends this Duty, and how frequently he exercised himself in it; Nor can it well have escap'd Observation, how much he was own'd and bless'd in it, and of what great Benefit it evidently was to his Soul. Among all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Days he spent in secret Fasting and Prayer, that he gives an Account of in his <HI>Diary,</HI> there is scarce an Instance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> either attended or soon followed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and a remarkable Blessing, in special Incomes and Consolations of God's Spirit; and very often, before the Day was ended.&mdash; But it must be observed. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at when he se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> about this Duty, he did it in good
<PB N="307" REF="006311_0340_0000000000000000">
Earnest; <HI>stirring up himself to take hold of God,</HI> and continuing <HI>instant in Prayer,</HI> with much of the Spirit of <HI>Jacob,</HI> who said to the Angel, <HI>I will not let thee go, except th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> bless me.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. There is much in the preceding Account to excite and encourage God's People to earnest Prayers and Endea|vours for the <HI>Advancement</HI> and <HI>Enlargement</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of CHRIST in the <HI>World.</HI> Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> sat us an excellent Ex|ample in this Respect: He sought the Prosperity of <HI>Zion</HI> with all his Might: He prefer'd <HI>Jerusalem</HI> above his chief Joy. How did his Soul long for it, and pant after it! And how earnestly and often did he wrestle with God for it! And how far did he, in these Desires and Prayers, seem to be carried beyond all private and selfish Views! being animated by a pure Love to Christ, an earnest Desire of his Glory, and a disinterested Affection to the Souls of Mankind.</P>
<P>The Consideration of this, not only ought to be an <HI>Incitement</HI> to the People of God, but may also be a just <HI>Encouragement</HI> to 'em, to be much in seeking and praying for a general Out|pouring of the Spirit of God, and extensive Revival of Religion. I confess, that God's giving so much of a Spirit of Prayer for this Mercy to so eminent a Servant of his, and exciting him, in so extraordinary a Manner, and with such vehement Thirstings of Soul, to agonize in Prayer for it, from Time to Time, thro' the Course of his Life, is one Thing, among others, which gives me great Hope, that God has a Design of accomplishing something very glorious for the Interest of his Church before long. One such Instance as this, I conceive, gives more En|couragement, than the common, cold, formal Prayers of Thousands. As Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Desires and Prayers for the coming of Christ's Kingdom, were very <HI>special</HI> and <HI>extraordinary</HI>; so, I think, we may reasonably hope, that the God, who ex|cited those Desires and Prayers, will answer them with some|thing <HI>special</HI> and <HI>extraordinary.</HI> And in a particular Manner, do I think it worthy to be taken Notice of for our Encouragement, that he had his Heart (as he declared) unusually, and beyond what had been before, drawn out in Longings and Prayers for the Flourishing of Christ's Kingdom on Earth, when he was in the Approaches of <HI>Death</HI>; and that with his dying Breath he did as it were breathe out his departing Soul into the Bosom of his Redeemer, in Prayers and Pantings after this glorious Event&punc; expiring in a very great Hope that it would soon begin to be ful|filed. And I wish, that the Tho'ts which he in his dying State
<PB N="308" REF="006311_0341_0000000000000000">
expressed of that explicit Agreement, and visible Union of God's People, in extraordinary Prayer for a general Revival of Reli|gion, lately proposed in a Memorial from <HI>Scotland,</HI> which has been dispersed among us, may be well considered by those that hitherto have not seen fit to fall in with that Proposal.&mdash;But I forbear to say any more on this Head, having already largely published my Thoughts upon it, in a Discourse written on Pur|pose to promote that Affair; which, I confess, I wish that every one of my Readers might be supplied with; not that my Honour, but that this excellent Design might be promoted.</P>
<P>As there is much in Mr. <HI>Brainerd's</HI> Life to encourage Chri|stians to seek the Advancement of Christ's Kingdom, in gene|ral; so there is, in particular, to pray for the Conversion of the <HI>Indians</HI> on this Continent, and to exert themselves in the Use of proper Means for it's Accomplishment. For it appears, that he in his unutterable Longings and Wrestlings of Soul for the Flourishing of Religion, had his Mind peculiarly intent on the Conversion and Salvation of these People, and his Heart more especially engaged in Prayer for them. And if we consi|der the Degree and Manner in which he from Time to Time, sought and hoped for an extensive Work of Grace among them, I think, we have Reason to hope, that the wonderful Things, which God wrought among them by him, are but a Fore-runner of something yet much more glorious and extensive of that Kind; and this may justly be an Encouragement, to well-disposed charitable Persons, to <HI>honour the Lord with their Sub|stance,</HI> by contributing, as they are able, to promote the spread|ing of the Gospel among them; and this also may incite and en|courage Gentlemen who are incorporated, and intrusted with the Care and Disposal of those liberal Benefactions, which have already been made by pious Persons, to that End; and likewise the Missionaries themselves, that are or may be employed; and it may be of Direction unto both, as to the proper Qualifications of Missionaries, and the proper Measures to be taken in order to their Success.</P>
<P>One Thing in particular, I would take Occasion from the foregoing History to mention and propose to the Consideration of such as have the Care of providing and sending <HI>Missionaries</HI> among Savages; <HI>viz.</HI> Whether it would not ordinarily be best to send <HI>two</HI> together? It is pretty manifest, that Mr. <HI>Brainerd's</HI> going, as he did, alone into the howling Wilderness, was one great Occasion of such a prevailing of Melancholy on his Mind; which was his greatest Disadvantage. He was much in speak|ing
<PB N="309" REF="006311_0342_0000000000000000">
of it himself, when he was here in his dying State; and ex|pressed himself, to this Purpose, that none could conceive of the Disadvantage a Missionary in such Circumstances was un|der, by being alone; especially as it exposed him to Discou|ragement and Melancholy: And spoke of the Wisdom of Christ in sending forth his Disciples by Two and Two; and left it as his dying Advice to his Brother, never to go to <HI>Susquahannah,</HI> to travel about in that remote Wilderness, to preach to the <HI>Indians</HI> there, as <HI>he</HI> had often done, without the Company of a <HI>Fellow-Missionary.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. One Thing more may not be unprofitably observed in the preceeding Account of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>; and that is the <HI>special</HI> and <HI>remarkable Disposal</HI> of divine Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">dence, with Re|gard to the <HI>Circumstances</HI> of his last <HI>Sickness and Death.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' he had been long infirm, his Constitution being much broken by his Fatigues and Hardships; and tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was often brought very low by Illness, before he left <HI>Kaunaumeek,</HI> and also while he lived at the <HI>Forks of Delaware</HI>: Yet his Life was preserved, 'till he had seen that which he had so long and greatly desired and sought, a glorious Work of Grace among the <HI>Indians,</HI> and had received the wished for Blessing of God on his Labours. Tho' as it were in <HI>Deaths oft,</HI> yet he lived to behold the happy Fruits of the long continued Travail of his Soul and Labour of his Body, in the wonderful Conver|sion of many of the Heathen, and the happy Effect of it in the great Change of their Conversation, with many Circumstances which afforded a fair Prospect of the Continuance of God's Blessing upon them; as may appear by what I shall presently further observe.&mdash; Thus he did not <HI>depart, 'till his Eyes had seen God's Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' it was the Pleasure of God, that he should be taken off from his Labours among that People whom God had made him a spiritual Father to, who were so dear to him, and whose spiritual Welfare he was so greatly concerned for; yet this was not before they were well initiated and instructed in the Chris|tian Religion, thoroughly weaned from their old heathenish and brutish Notions and Practices, and all their Prejudices and Jealousies, which tended to keep their Minds unsettled, were fully removed; and they were confirmed and fixed in the Christian Faith and Manners, were formed into a Church, had ecclesiastical Ordinances and Discip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine introduced &amp; settled; were brought into a good Way with Respect to the Education of Children, had a School Master sent to them in Providence,
<PB N="310" REF="006311_0343_0000000000000000">
excellently qualified for the Business, and had a School set up and established, in good Order, among them; had been well brought off from their former Idle, strolling, sottish Way of Living; had removed from their former scattered uncertain Habitations; and were collected in a Town by themselves, on a good Piece of Land of their own; were introduced into the Way of living by Husbandry, and begun to experience the Benefits of it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These Things were but just brought to pass by his indefatigable Application and Care, and then he was taken off from his Work by Illness. If this had been but a little sooner, they would by no Means have been so well pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|pared for such a Dispensation; and it probably would have been unspeakably more to the Hurt of their spiritual Interest, and of the Cause of Christianity among them.</P>
<P>The Time and Circumstances of his Illness were so or|dered, that he had just Opportunity to finish his <HI>Journal,</HI> and prepare it for the Press; giving an Account of the marvellous Display of divine Power and Grace among the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> and at the <HI>Forks of Delaware:</HI> His doing which was a Thing of great Consequence, and therefore urged upon him by the <HI>Correspondents,</HI> who have honour'd his Journal with a Preface. The World being particularly and justly informed of that Affair by Mr. <HI>Brainerd,</HI> before his Death, a Foundation was hereby laid for a Concern in <HI>others</HI> for that Cause, and proper Care and Measures to be taken for the maintaining it after his Death. As it has actually proved to be of great Influ|ence and Benefit in this Respect ; it having excited and engaged many in those Parts, and also more distant Parts of <HI>America,</HI> to exert themselves for the upholding and promoting so good and glorious a Work, remarkably opening their Hearts and Hands to that End: And not only in <HI>America,</HI> but in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> where that <HI>Journal</HI> (which is the same that I have earnestly re|commended to my Readers to possess themselves of) has been an Occasion of some large Benefactions, made for the promoting the Interest of Christianity among the <HI>Indians.</HI>&mdash;If Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> had been taken Ill but a little sooner, he had not been able to compleat this his Journal, and prepare a Copy for the Press.</P>
<P>He was not taken off from the Work of the Ministry among his People, 'till his <HI>Brother</HI> was in a Capacity and Circum|stances to <HI>succeed</HI> him in his Care of them: Who succeeds him in the like Spirit, and under whose prudent and faithful Care his Congregation has flourished, and been very happy, since he
<PB N="311" REF="006311_0344_0000000000000000">
left them; and probably could not have been so well provided for, otherwise. If Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> had been disabled sooner, his <HI>Brother</HI> would by no Means have been ready to stand up in his Place; having taken his first Degree at College but about that very Time that he was seiz'd with his fatal Consump|tion.</P>
<P>Tho' in that Winter that he lay sick at Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI>'s in <HI>Elisabeth-Town,</HI> he continued for a long Time in an extremely low State, so that his Life was almost despair'd of, and his State was sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch that it was hardly expected he would live a Day to an End; yet his Life was spared a while longer; he lived to see his <HI>Brother</HI> arrived in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> being come to succeed him in the Care of his <HI>Indians</HI>; and he himself had Opportunity to assist in his Examination and Introduction into his Business; and to commit the Conduct of his dear People to One whom he well knew, and could put Confidence in, and use Freedom with in giving him particular Instructions and Charges, and under whose Care he could leave his Congrega|tion with great Chearfulness.</P>
<P>The Providence of God was remarkable in so ordering of it, that before his Death he should take a Journey into <HI>New-England,</HI> and go to <HI>Boston:</HI> Which was, in many Respects, of very great and happy Consequence to the Interest of Religion, and especially among his own People. By this Means, as has been observed, he was brought into Acquaintance with many Persons of Note and Influence, Ministers and others, belonging both to the Town and various Parts of the Coun|try; and had Opportunity, under the best Advantages, to bear a Testimony for God and true Religion, and against those false Appearances of it that have proved most pernicious to the Interests of Christ's Kingdom in the Land. And the Provi|dence of God is particularly observable in this Circumstance of the Testimony he there bore for true Religion; <HI>viz.</HI> That he there was brought so near the <HI>Grave,</HI> and continued for so long a Time on the very Brink of Eternity; and from Time to Time, look'd on himself, and was look'd on by others, as just leaving the World; and that in these Circumstances he should be so particularly directed and assisted in his Tho'ts and Views of Religion, to distinguish between the true and the false, with such Clearness and Evidence; and that after this he should be unexpectedly and surprizingly restored and strengthned, so far as to be able to converse freely; and have such Opportunity, and special Occasions to declare the Senti|ments
<PB N="312" REF="006311_0345_0000000000000000">
he had in these, which were, to human Apprehension, his dying Circumstances; and to bear his Testimony concern|ing the Nature of true Religion, and concerning the mischie|vous Tendency of it's most prevalent Counterfeits and false Appearances; as Things he had a special, clear, distinct View of at that Time, when he expected in a few Minutes to be in Eternity; and the Certainty &amp; Importance of which were then, in a peculiar Manner, impress'd on his Mind.</P>
<P>Among the happy Consequences of his going to <HI>Boston,</HI> were those liberal Benefactions that have been mention'd, which were made by pious disposed Persons, for the maintaining and promoting the Interest of Religion among his People: And also the meeting of a Number of Gentlemen in <HI>Boston,</HI> of Note and Ability, to consult upon Measures for that Purpose; who were excited by their Acquaintance and Conversation with Mr. <HI>Brainerd,</HI> and by the Account of the great Things God had wrought by his Ministry, to unite themselves, that by their joint Endeavours and Contributions they might promote the Kingdom of Christ, and the spiritual Good of their Fellow-Creatures, among the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> and elsewhere.</P>
<P>It was also remarkable, that Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> should go to <HI>Boston,</HI> at <HI>that Time</HI>; after the honourable Commissioners there, of the Corporation in <HI>London</HI> for propagating the Gospel in <HI>New-England</HI> and Parts adjacent, had received Dr. <HI>Wil|liam</HI>'s Legacy for the maintaining of two Missionaries among the Heathen; and at a Time when they having concluded on a Mission to the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six-Nations</HI> (so called) were looking out for fit Persons to be imployed in that Important Service. This proved an Occasion of their committing to him the Affair of finding and recommending suitable Persons: Which has proved a succesful Means of two Persons being found and actually appointed to that Business; who seem to be well qualified for it, and to have their Hearts greatly engaged in it: One of which has been solemnly ordain'd to that Work in <HI>Boston,</HI> and is now gone forth to one of those Tribes, who have appeared well-disposed to his Reception: It being judged not convenient for the other to go 'till the next Spring, by Reason of his bodily Infirmity. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Appointment of these Gentlemen to this Mission has been <HI>hitherto</HI> much smiled on in Providence; as in other Respects, so particularly in the wonderful opening of the Hearts of many to contribute liberally to so excel|lent a Design; besides the Benefactions in <HI>Boston,</HI> a Number of Persons at <HI>Northampton</HI> with much Chearfulness have given about &pound;. 160 (old Tenor); and a particular Per|son in <HI>Springfield</HI> has devoted a considerable Part of his Estate to this Interest.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="006311_0346_0000000000000000">These happy Consequences of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Journey to <HI>Boston</HI> would have been prevented, in Case he had died, when he was brought so near to Death in <HI>New-Jersey.</HI> Or if after he came first to <HI>Northampton</HI> (where he was much at a Loss and long deliberating which Way to bend his Course) he had determined not to go to <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>The Providence of God was observable in his going to <HI>Boston</HI> at a Time when not only the honourable Commissioners were seeking Missionaries to the <HI>Six Nations</HI>; but just after his <HI>Journal,</HI> which gives an Account of his Labours and Suc|cess among the <HI>Indians,</HI> had been received and spread in <HI>Boston:</HI> Whereby his Name was known, and the Minds of serious People were well prepared to receive his Person, and the Testimony he there gave for God; to exert themselves for the upholding and promoting the Interest of Religion in his Congregation, and amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> elsewhere; and to regard his Judgment concerning the Qualifications of Missio|naries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If he had gone there the Fall before (when he had intended to have made his Journey into <HI>New-England,</HI> but was prevented by a sudden great Increase of his Illness) it would not have been likely to have been in any Measure to so good Effect: And also if he had not been unexpectedly detained in <HI>Boston</HI>; For when he went from my House, he intended to make but a very short Stay there; But divine Providence by his being brought so low there, detain'd him long; thereby to make Way for the fulfilling it's own gracious Designs.</P>
<P>The Providence of God was remarkable in so ordering, that altho' he was brought so very near the Grave in <HI>Boston,</HI> that it was not in the least expected he would ever come alive out of his Chamber; yet he wonderfully revived, and was pre|served several Months longer: So that he had Opportunity to see, and fully to converse with both his younger <HI>Brethren</HI> before he died; which was a Thing he greatly desired; and especially to see his Brother <HI>John,</HI> with whom was left the Care of his Con|gregation; that he might by him be fully informed of their
<PB N="314" REF="006311_0347_0000000000000000">
State, and might leave with him such Instructions and Direc|tions as were requisite in order to their spiritual Welfare, and to send to them his dying Charges and Counsels. And he had also Opportunity, by Means of this Suspension of his Death, to find and recommend a Couple of Persons fit to be employed as <HI>Missionaries</HI> to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> as had been desired of him.</P>
<P>Thus, altho' it was the Pleasure of a sovereign God, that he should be taken away from his Congregation, the People that he had begotten through the Gospel, who were so dear to him; yet it was granted to him, that before he died he should see them well <HI>provided for,</HI> every<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Way: He saw them provided for with One to instruct them, and take Care of their Souls; his own Brother, whom he could confide in: He saw a good Foundation laid for the Support of the School among them; those Things that before were wanting in order to it, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing supplied: And he had the Prospect of a <HI>charitable Society</HI> being established, of able and well-disposed Persons, who seem to make the spiritual Interest of his Congregation their own; whereby he had a comfortable View of their being well-pro|vided for, for the future: And he had also Opportunity to leave all his dying Charges with his Successor in the Pastoral Care of his People, and by him to send his dying Counsels to them. Thus God granted him to see all Things happily settled, or in a hopeful Way of being so, before his Death, with Re|spect to his dear People &mdash; And whereas not only his own Con|gregation, but the Souls of the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>North-America</HI> in general, were very dear to him, and he had greatly set his Heart on the propagating and extending the Kingdom of Christ among 'em; God was pleased to grant to him (however it was his Will, that he should be taken away, and so should not be the immediate Instrument of their Instruction and Con|version, yet) that before his Death, he should see unexpected extraordinary Provision made for this also. And 'tis remarka|ble, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> God not only allowed him to see such Provision made for the maintaining the Interest of Religion among his own People, and the Propagation of it elsewhere; but honoured him by making <HI>him</HI> the Means or Occ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sion of it. So that it is very probable, however Mr. <HI>Brainerd,</HI> during the last four Months of his Life, was ordinarily in an extremely weak and low State, very often scarcely able to speak; yet that he was made the Instrument or Means of much more Good in that Space of
<PB N="315" REF="006311_0348_0000000000000000">
Time, than he would have been if he had been well, and in full Strength of Body. Thus <HI>God's Power</HI> was manife<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed in <HI>his Weakness,</HI> and the <HI>Life of Christ</HI> was manifested in <HI>his mortal Flesh.</HI></P>
<P>Another Thing, wherein appears the merciful Disposal of Providence with Respect to his Death, was, that he did not die in the Wilderness, among the Savages, at <HI>Kaunaumeek,</HI> or the <HI>Forks of Delaware,</HI> or at <HI>Susqua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">annah</HI>; but in a Place where his dying Behaviour and Speeches might be observed and re|membred, and some Account given of them for the Benefit of Survivors; and also where Care might be taken of him in his Sickness, and proper Honours done him at his Death.</P>
<P>The Providence of God is also worthy of Remark&punc; in so over-ruling and ordering the Matter, that he did not finally leave absolute Orders for the intire suppressing of his <HI>private Papers</HI>; as he had intended and fully resolved, insomuch that all the Importunity of his Friends could scarce restrain him from doing it, when sick at <HI>Boston.</HI> And one Thing relating to this is peculiarly remarkable, <HI>viz.</HI> that his Brother, a little before his Death, should come from the <HI>Jerseys</HI> unexpected, and bring his <HI>Diary</HI> to him, tho' he had received no such Order. So that he had Opportunity of Access to these his reserved Pa|pers, and for reviewing the same; without which, it appears, he would at last have ordered them to be wholly suppress'd: But after this, he the more readily yielded to the Desires of his Friends, and was willing to leave them in their Hands to be disposed of as they thought might be most for God's Glory: By which Means, <HI>he being dead, yet speaketh,</HI> in these Memoirs of his Life, taken from those private Writings: Whereby it is to be hoped he may still be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as it were the Instrument of much promoting the Interest of Religion in this World; the Advancement of which he so much desired, and hoped would be accomplish'd after his Death.</P>
<P>If these Circumstances of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Death be duly considered, I doubt not but they will be acknowledged as a notable Instance of God's Fatherly Care, and Covenant-Faith|fulness towards them that are devoted to him, and faithfully serve him while they live; whereby <HI>he never fails nor forsakes them,</HI> but <HI>is with them</HI> living and dying; so that <HI>whether they live, they live to the LORD; or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">hether they die, they die to the</HI> LORD; and both in Life and Death they are own'd and taken Care of as <HI>His.</HI>&mdash;Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI> himself as was before observed,
<PB N="316" REF="006311_0349_0000000000000000">
was much in taking Notice (when near his End) of the mer|ciful Circumstances of his Death; and said, from Time to Time, that <HI>God had granted him all his Desire.</HI></P>
<P>And I would not conclude my Observations on the merciful Circumstances of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Death without acknowledg|ing with Thankfulness, the gracious Dispensation of Providence to me and my Family, in so ordering, that he (tho' the ordi|nary Place of his Abode was more than 200 Miles distant) should be cast hither, to my House, in his last Sickness, and should die here: So that we had Opportunity for much Ac|quaintance and Conversation with him, and to shew him Kind|ness in such Circumstances, and to see his dying Behaviour, to hear his dying Speeches, to receive his dying Counsels, and to have the Benefit of his dying Prayers. May God in in|finite Mercy grant, that we may ever retain a proper Remem|brance of these Things, and make a due Improvement of the Advantages we have had, in these Respects! The Lord grant also, that the foregoing Account of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s Life and Death may be for the great spiritual Benefit of all that shall read it, and prove a happy Means of promoting the Revival of true Religion in these Parts of the World. AMEN.</P>
