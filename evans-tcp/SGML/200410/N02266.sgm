<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>AS <HI>Trade</HI> is a noble Subject very copious, so it deserves a better Genius and Capacity than I am Master of, to discourse of the several Branches thereof.</P>
<P>But some ingenious and well meaning Persons having employ'd their Pens that way, from the generous Motives and Views of promoting the publick Good, I perswade my self 'tis a good Omen and Presage of the future Happiness of a Country, especially when it appears in private Persons, who for the most Part may be presum'd to be free from the By|ass of sinister Interest; whereas publi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k Projectors, under the specious Pretences of publick Spiritedness and Promotion of Trade, secretly carry on their private Interest, without any true Regard to the
<PB N="4" REF="002697_0003_0FE60CA2B64090A8">
Publick, and which they too often sacri+fice, to the great Damage, if not Ruin thereof.</P>
<P>But since nothing of what has been wrote on this Subject, has been so publick and common as is necessary to render it of publick Service and Advantage; and considering Trade is of the last Impor|tance to the Good and Prosperity of any Country, and how much it has languish'd for divers Years past in the Colonies ly|ing on <HI>Delaware</HI>; insomuch that Trade not only sunk, but most of the middling People, and divers good House-keepers, as well as the inferiour Rank labour'd under inextricable Difficulties, Silver and Gold the only Legal Currency, being almost totally exhausted, or kept up, that thro' the Scarcity thereof, the Farmer to pay a D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bt was forc'd to sell twice as much as he needed to come at Silver, and take one part in such Goods as he did not want, till at last scarce any Money could be come at, to answer his Occasi|ons, much less to pay his Debts, or dis|charge the Incumbrance great Numbers

of Estates lay under; all Credit private and publick, being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unk.</P>
<P>And that this is not a groundless Sug|gestion, or a Misrepresentation of the State of the Country; but a Truth known to all who saw the late deplora|ble Condition of these Colonies compa|red to what they were some Years past. When Grain bore a Price, the Farmer cou'd live by his Labour, the Tradesman, the Artificer and the Merchant encreased in Wealth and got Estates, what Colony then on the Continent of <HI>America</HI> of better Credit and more punctual in their Dealing? but since Husbandry the Foun|dation of our Trade has been so fatally discouraged by the low Price of Grain, and our Currency, the vital Spirit and Blood of the Body politick stagnated, in|stead of (prompt Payment) so much the Honour of our Country, has been intro|duc'd the mean and scandalous Way of <HI>Discount, Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck</HI> and <HI>Turn-ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> which ended at last in re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ding Law-Suits and barbarous Attachments, the Ban<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Con|cord, Peace and Civil Society, and the Preludes of Poverty.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002697_0005_0FE60C9C81AF1B48" MS="y">Hence it was that this melancholy Scene of Affairs being laid to Heart by some sympathising Persons from a Sense of the languishing Condi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of the Coun|try crying for Relief from their Repre|sentatives, who, as honest Men and worthy Patriots, engag'd themselves for their Country's Relief, by providing a Medium for Commerce and Dealing by a Paper-Credit, which tho' far short of what the Nego<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of these Colonies requir'd, yet it answer'd our present Exigencies, reviv'd Trade, render'd Commerce and Dealing more easie and safe.</P>
<P>And 'tis with much Pleasure I have since met with divers who have acknow|ledged the Advantages they have receiv'd thereby, as having no Prospect of being relieved or freeing their Estates from the Incumbrances and Engagements they were under but thereby, as the only Expe|dient that with Honour and Justice could be found to restore Credit, and put them|selves in a Capacity to approve them just and honest Men.</P>

this present Year 1724. It may contri|bute to enable divers Inhabitants on both Sides the River to engage in Foreign Trade which will not only be our pre|sent Relief, but a Means to restore us to our former flourishing Condition by ad|vancing and encreasing our foreign as well as Domestick Trade, which is what only can compleat ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Happiness and re-instate us in any Degree of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Tranquility.</P>
<P>And indeed without this we and our Posterity must inevitably sink and relapse into our late deplorable Condition, if we do not in some uncommon Way exert our selves to promote Manufacture, Trade and Navigation.</P>
<P>These Thoughts of late have been the Subject of my serious Deliberation; and indeed I have been sorrowfully affected when I have considered that this River which was settled with a sober, religious and industrious People, who were of no mean Circumstances in their native Coun|try, should be so soon reduc'd to so low a Condition as of late we were; which how to retreive in Time is the Design and

Intendment of this Essay, wherein if the Ideas I have formed are not agreeable to the Nature of the Subject, or may not be judged practicable, 'tis to be hoped some other Person of better Notions and bright|er Conceptions in those Affairs may compleat what I have from just Views taken in hand, having sincerely the pub|lick Good, and the Interest of these Co|lonies at Heart, separate from all other Views whatsoever; for I cannot doubt but every honest Man finds a secret Joy in contributing any Thing to the Happi|ness of his Country either in Respect of Wealth, good Laws or Liberty, as know|ing he is not born for himself.</P>
<P>In Order thereunto, 'twill be necessary to consider what the true Riches of any Country does consist in, or whence we may be truly denominated rich or wealthy, that so we may not amuse our selves with Chimerical Notions or imaginary Riches in a Matter of so great Importance as our present Happiness, and of that of our Posterity, in which we shall observe some Methods the better to be under|stood.

<P>I conceive we shall prove th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se Po|sitions from the undeniable Evidence of Fact and Experience, wherein we mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be somewhat historical; for Examples in such Cases do better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llustrate than Rea|soning and Argumentation.</P>

what they have in this new World, ex|ceeds all That in the Old,) a great Part of their Country fertile and productive of all that is necessary for the Life of Man, and much for Pleasure; For Ex|tent of Territory their Historians glory to say, <HI>The Sun never sets in their Domi|nions</HI>; well accommodated for Trade by Scituation; with Bays, Harbours and artificial Moles, and not long since the Terror of <HI>Europe</HI> for Maritime Power which they stil'd <HI>Invincible:</HI></P>
<P>Thus a Country where Nature seems to have been prodigally diffusive of all that Mortals can wish, or that may render a Nation happy, is now faln from their pristine Glory, and of late Years reduc'd to a mean Appearance in the World, and of small Account in the Af|fairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> thro' Neglect of Manu|factory, Trade and Navigation, sunk and lost their ancient Grandeur, so as to per|mit two Foreign Armies in the Bowels of their Country, contending t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Right of providing a King for their Monarchy, who at last split it in Pieces, whilst they were little other than Spectators.</P>

<P>From these Examples we presume we have undeniably demonstrated all those Positions about Matters of Fact, except that of Paper-Money, which we shall refer to a subsequent Part of this Discourse: But here we shall acknowledge it to be a known Maxim, that <HI>Populacy is the Rich|es of a Country</HI>; but it must be under|stood of an industrious and laborious People, such as are the <HI>Palatines</HI> and o|thers, and not Convicts or the Scum of Goals, who are a Nusance to the Countries whence they came, and will contribute no more to the Advantage of a Country than the most salvage <HI>Indians.</HI></P>

But on the contrary, if any Country is so happy in their Trade with other Coun|tries as that their Exports to such Coun|tries exce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the Imports, by whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Means the Ballance is in their Favour;

instead of paying, they receive of their <HI>Bullion,</HI> or what is equivalent their <HI>Euro|pean</HI> Goods: And this was formerly the case in our <HI>Trade</HI> to the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> When our Exports much exceeded our Imports, the Ballance came back in Bullion; hence it was, we so much abounded with Sil|ver and Gold; but as Riches is the Mo|ther of Luxury and Idleness, it may be said, as in another Case, <HI>the Daughter devoured the Mother.</HI></P>
<P>But as this River grows more popu|lous, which encreases our Demands from <HI>England</HI>; and as by the more frequent Use of <HI>Rum,</HI> the Consumption of the <HI>West-India</HI> Goods encreases on us; hence, from the low Markers and Gluts of our River-Produce there, it is not probable we are in a Condition to ballance with any Place we trade to at this Time, which gives a very melancholy Prospect, and which all true Lovers of their Coun|try should seriously lay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o Heart.</P>
<P>And to possess every sensible Farmer of the Truth and Certainty of this Asserti|on, let it be supposed that he is one pos|sess'd

of a spacious Farm, of a rich Soil, well stock'd with Cattle, and all other Advantages, which may render a Farm profitable; Nevertheless, if thro the low Price of the Produce in general, and Charge of Husbandry, which is very great, the Produce of his Farm will not ballance with the Shops and Stores, he must inevitable become poor. Now as no Man can reasonably deny this; so a just Inference may be from the lesser to the greater; for as every individual Mem|ber of the Community must in a most sensible manner acknowledge this, Rea|son will enforce the same as applicable to the Body conjunctively. And the true Cause of our Poverty and sunk Con|dition is obvious, namely the low Pric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of our Country-Produce, which can ne|ver be retriev'd but by the Encourage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ment of Manufacture, Trade and Navi|gation, which only will enable us to ballance with those Countries we are con|cern'd in Trade withal, by which Mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our Lands and Produce, will advance i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Value, which is what we may properly call Riches.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="002697_0014_0FE60CB5D1EF4730">I have been the more particular in this Notice to the Farmer, who not consi|dering the Importance of Trade to the Benefit of a Country, and being unac|quainted therewith, choose Men to re|present them who are as much unacquain|ted as themselves; that if one Assem|bly happily pass a good Law, for the Promotion of Trade, the next being imposed on by wrong Notions, undo what a former Assembly have done, to the great Injury of Trade and the Coun|try in general. Of this we have an In|stance in the <HI>Eastern</HI> Division of the <HI>Jerseys,</HI> where there have been good Pro|jects advanc'd: But for Want of Patience to see the desired Effects, all dropt again, and came to nothing: The same has hap|pened on the Western Shore of <HI>Delaware,</HI> where an Impost on that destructive Li|quor <HI>Rum,</HI> laid by one Assembly, with other good Laws for the Advancement of Trade, Navigation and Building of Ships, have been taken off by succeeding Assem|blies, only from wrong Notions, not al|lowing Time for Experience, which is the
<PB N="16" REF="002697_0015_0FE60CB5E0784568">
infallible Directress of Affairs of this Nature.</P>
<P>Now of what Importance it is to the Prosperity and Wealth of a Country to preserve the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">allance in Trade, our Mo|ther Country <HI>England</HI> is well aware of, being a Nation that very well under|stands their true Interest, and are as fine in their Politicks as any Nation in <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> We cannot so low a better Exam|ple, in copying after her (as far as prac|ticable under our Circum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tances of a de|pendent Government) whose Prudence and Policy it is to consider the State of Trade with every Nation they trade with|al; as I remember soon after King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Accession to the Throne, the People following the Example of the Court, sell in with the Modes and Hu|mour of <HI>France,</HI> which together with o|ther Luxuries deriv'd from that Nation, gave a very strange Turn to the Affairs of <HI>England. France</HI> encreas'd in Trade, and Naval Force, and <HI>England</HI> declin|ing, the Nation seeing their Error, an Address from the Parliament was present|ed,
<PB N="17" REF="002697_0016_0FE60CBA85907040">
petitioning his Majesty that he would be graciously pleased by his own Exam|ple, to encourage the constant wearing of the Manufacturies of his own Sub|jects, and discourage those of Strangers; but so devoted was the Court to <HI>French</HI> Measures, that it had little Effect. Then followed the Act for burying in Woollen, the Ballance of Trade continuing in Fa|vour of <HI>France</HI>; next a Prohibition of <HI>French</HI> Wines, with other good Acts for the Encouragement of Trade and Navi|gation. Of so great Importance is the Ballance of Trade to any Country, as that which can only render a Country opulent.</P>
<P>From these Premises necessarily fol|lows what we first propos'd; namely the <HI>Way and Means for the Colonies on</HI> De|laware <HI>to become rich</HI>; or in the Expla|nation above, how we may attain to a Condition to ballance Trade in our Fa|vour with all Places we trade to; which in Effect is the same; which we shall descend to do with as much Brevity as so large a Subject will admit of.</P>
<P>As the principal Design and Intend|ment
<PB N="18" REF="002697_0017_0FE60CBA93EC8E30">
of this Discourse is the promoting of Trade and Traffick, Foreign and Do|mestick, which as they are of a com|plicated Nature, the Ways and Means tending thereunto, are likewise divers and various. But</P>
<P>Tho' we have said the Produce of the Country simply considered cannot make us rich, (for often it is at so low a Price in these Countries, that the Farmer is not able to live at the Rates it sells for) yet it must be granted that 'tis the <HI>Pri|mum,</HI> the Foundation and principal Me|dium and Staple of our Trade both Fo|reign and Domestick. And here we are led to consider, that as Manufactory and Navigation is the Way of improving such Country-Produce, so all possible Incou|ragement ought to be given for the ma|nufacturing such Country-Product as is capable of improving that Way, whe|ther spontaneous or artificial, under which two General Heads may be concluded all the several Species.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHEAT. To begin with tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Specie which is the chief Staple of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="19" REF="002697_0018_0FE60CBD36EEE978" MS="y">
Trade. <HI>Wheat,</HI> from the Nature of the Soil and Climate, is what we are capable to raise in vast Quantities, and what we are mostly to depend on, and was the chief Matter of our Trade in the most flou|rishing State of these Colonies, which being manufactured into Bread, Flour, Starch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> renders it of twice the Va|lue as in Grain, consequently will pur|chase twice the Value of Goods from those Markets it's sent to, than in Grain, and casts the Ballance the more in our Favour, being sold for so much more than other|wise it would, which makes the Returns the more valuable for those we sell to pay the Labour and Charge of manufac|turing and Freight. Hence several Trades|men and Artificers are immediately em|ploy'd, by whom again divers others, as Butchers, Bakers, Taylors, Shoemakers; and by the Bulkiness of the Commodities Navigation is promoted, all which is the Foundation of Towns (the Fame and Riches of Countries) which I conceive to be the most proper Places for Bolting and Baking; and it would be the Advan|tage
<PB N="20" REF="002697_0019_0FE60C93D310B108" MS="y">
of the Farmer if they declin'd boult|ing their Meal, and sent it to Town, as I could easily demonstrate, and which Experience has fully evinc'd. For I just|ly date the Fall of Flour from the Time of the Farmer becoming Boulters; but this only by the bye.</P>
<P>But to return. The Manufacturing of all our Wheat is rather to be wished than expected, for when far greater Quantities of Wheat were exported than of late, we had sufficient to manufacture and supply all our Plantations in the <HI>West-Indies</HI>; and those Markets of late have been glutted to that Degree, that the Merchant and Boulter complain of Loss there as well as the Farmer by the low Price here, as ap|pears by the Numbers of Estates that were encumbred, tho' many but for small Debts from which they could not extricate them|selves till the Expedien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a Loan-Office was pitch'd upon. But tho that has proved a present Relief, yet 'tis to be doubted divers will relapse into the same Conditi|on, unless some Way is found to augment the Value of the Farmers Labour; for by
<PB N="21" REF="002697_0020_0FE60CB3D279C450">
the Value of the Produce, Land will rise, and be more valuable, which is what must make these Provinces really rich, o|therwise we are but nominally so, not|withstanding we might have a Million of Paper-Money.</P>
<P>From these Considerations, proper Me|thods ought to be thought on to advance the Price of Wheat, and to enable the Farmer to live; for if he sinks, at long Run, all sinks. 'Tis by his Labour as already observ'd, Trade must be support|ed, and Land render'd valuable: The Merchants Interest is inseparable from the Farmers; and if he cannot make an Ad|vantage by raising of Grain, he'll make the less, and endeavour to cloath himself without much Use of their Stores or Shops. And if the Chain of mutual De|pendance is broken, twill be the Disad|vantage of both: Therefore we offer an Expedient which will be the Advantage and Encouragement of the Trader and Farmer, whose Interest we shall imparti|ally regard in Prosecution of this Essay.</P>
<P>We humbly propose to the Honoura|ble
<PB N="22" REF="002697_0021_0FE5F23023388290">
the Legislative Authority of the Pro|vinces on <HI>Delaware,</HI> that a Bounty of <HI>per</HI> Bushel be paid for all Wheat which shall be exported to any Parts of the Continent of <HI>Europe;</HI> as to <HI>France, Spain, Portugal,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Italy</HI> is a Market for that Species. By this Means Encouragement will be given to find out new Markets: The Bounty to be raised by a Land-Tax, or a Duty on Rum, or as the Honourable Assemblies may think fit. Tho it may be objected, that the Country cannot bear a Land-Tax, yet 'tis not to be doubted but as by this Means there will less Quantities be sent to the Islands, this will abate the Glut, and consequently what goes, will fetch the better Price. Hence the Country may easily bear a Land-Tax, when most probably they will be re im|burs'd by the Advance of the Price of that Grain to what of late it has been, or in Reason can be expected, whilst the <HI>West Indies</HI> is the only Markets we depend on, where the Markets for our Country-Pro|duct of late has been so low that we can|not ballance with them with all our Ex|ports as already <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emark'd.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="002697_0022_0FE5F2310AF28168" MS="y">This will encourage Navigation, and the Building of Ships, which how far it will conduce to the Advantage of these Countries, shall be discours'd in a proper Place. But to proceed,</P>
<P>Having this further to offer to mature Consideration on this Branch; That whereas all Ships bound hither from <HI>Lis|bon</HI> come empty, or in their Ballast, this is a dead Weight to the Adventurer, whe|ther Merchant or Owners, and Discou|ragement to Navigation; for by this Means unless Wheat sells high, we have no Encouragement to send, having no Prospect of Advantage by Returns, which frequently helps a bad Market. There|fore we humbly propose to their Excel|lencies the Governours of these Provin|ces to use their Instances at home, with his Majesty our Sovereign King <HI>George,</HI> that he would be graciously pleased to permit all <HI>English</HI> Bottoms carrying Wheat to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> to return back with Salt into this River; and this we con|ceive will be no ways detrimental to the Navigation of <HI>Great Britain</HI> (to which
<PB N="24" REF="002697_0023_0FE5F23A95646120">
we shall propose nothing injurious) for by this Opportunity the <HI>British</HI> Traders will be on an equal Foot with the <HI>Baltick</HI> Traders, who by Loading home Salt, on which they are sure of making a profita|ble Voyage, have the Advantage of un|derselling what Wheat goes from hence, since otherwise the Profit of the Voyage solely depends on the Exports, and no|thing by Returns.</P>
<P>This we take to be the only Means to advance the Price of Grain which of late has been so low, that the Farmer has been reduc'd to the Brink of Ruin, and which will be his inevitable Fate without some timely Remedy. For we cannot do, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> are said to do, after they extorted from <HI>England</HI> the whole Spice Trade of the <HI>Indies,</HI> were careful to send no more home than they knew would supply <HI>Europe,</HI> so kept up the Price to a vast Profit of their <HI>India</HI>-Trade.

<P>BARLEY also is another artificial Product of these Countries, of which we have three Sorts, namely the common <HI>Barley</HI> with 4 Rows of Grain, the Winter <HI>Barley</HI> which grows much like it, and the <HI>English</HI> with only two Rows; all fit for Trade, when Manufactur'd and made into Malt for brewing of Beer, either for Ex|portation or Home Use, of which we have very good, if we will go to the Price, but thro the Depravity and Viciousness of our Palates, and the so frequent Use of Spirits there has not been due Care in the Brewing of Beer, by which it has lost its Credit at home and abroad.

It is the Chymical Extraction of Spirits from Matter of a low Value, whereby it is render'd of considerable Worth and Use; not only for Consumption at home, but for Transportation to any of our Neigh|bour Colonies; but little of the latter is to be expected, for they are afore-hand with us, and supply us, tho' we have the same or greater Advantages, which is a culpable Neglect of the Inhabitants on this River to their very great Damage, suffering our selves to be drain'd of our Silver when we had it, and now the best of our Produce for what we can easily supply our selves for about half the Cost; namely Melasses, besides other Matter we have to distill, as Cyder, Peach-Drink, decay'd Wines, as well as sundry

<P N="1"><Q>1. First, It is to be observed, that the <HI>West-Indies</HI> is the principal Market for our Country-Produce, and the chiefest Imployment for our Vessels
<PB N="43" REF="002697_0042_0FE60C680898CE40">

<P N="2"><Q>2. When a Cargo in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> is disposed of, the Returns for the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t part is Rum or Melasses, unless some|times Salt. If you buy Rum, it be|ing the most valuable, consequently the less will be the Ballance in your Favour.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q>3.

<P N="4"><Q>4. Melasses being the more bulky, the Vessels are the sooner back, so will be the readier for another Voyage, which is the Benefit of the Owners and Ship|pers, who by these Means will have the more frequent Opportunity of ship|ping Goods again;</Q>
to which it may be added, that it will give us the Op|portunity of other new Markets among
<PB N="44" REF="002697_0043_0FE60C69D3BDD158">
the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Settlements, from whom we have Melasses at a very cheap Rate, and will be not one Quarter the Cost of Rum, which, how far the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al|lance may be in our Favour, is obvious to every intelligent Reader.</P>
<P>RICE is another Specie of Grain, this Country is capable of, which grows and thrives very well here on new Land, with no other Tillage than what Barley requires, and is sown after the same Man|ner which is easier, and with less tend|ing than in <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>But as Mankind are rational Creatures, and as such are most adapted for Society, Commerce and Dealing, so Providence seems to have decreed various Climates for different Productions of Nature for a mutual Intercourse and Dependance on each other by exchanging the Growth of one Country with another, which is the Foundation of Traffick and Dealing. But in Case we were to raise that Grain here, it would in some Measure break that Chain of Intercourse and Dealing betwixt us and them. Therefore tis rather
<PB N="45" REF="002697_0044_0FE60C940E7F3E20" MS="y">
to be desir'd, that we should purchase that Specie of them, if upon an equal Foot, as they do the Produce of our Province from us: But <HI>Carolina</HI> is very ungenerous in this Case, for tho' we im|pose nothing on their Rice, Pitch, Tarr, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but all comes free into this River; yet they clogg our Beer and Flour with exorbitant Duties. For these Reasons it would not be amiss for us to endeavour the making of Rice here, unless they will permit the Produce of our Province exported among 'em to be free, as we do their Imports here. And it were to be wish'd, that as the Government at home have past Acts for the universal Rates of Silver in <HI>America</HI>; so if all the Ports in <HI>America</HI> were free to all <HI>British</HI> Subjects, we conceive it would very much advance Trade and Navigation in general.</P>
<P>THE other Things propos'd as Matter for Trade, come under the general Pre|dicament of spontaneous Productions, of which the Principal is Timber, which tho' of little Value as it stands in the Woods,

by Labour it may be rendred and made valuable by the Artist for Domestick Use by the Cooper, Joyner, Turner, House-Carpenter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and is proper to make Returns for <HI>England,</HI> either gross, as large Pines for Masts for Ships, which tho' cum|bersome and bulky the more it employs Ships and promotes Navigation. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut to render it yet of more Value and fit for Merchandize, is by converting it into Cooper's Timber and Plank of several Sorts, not only for Domestick Uses as are proper to employ Artificers, where|by the Value will be augmented by the Labour of divers of the Inhabitants, but for Exportation, which will also promote Navigation.</P>
<P>This may be done at all convenient Places by erecting Mills. For this we have two large Rivers, namely <HI>Dell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ware</HI> and <HI>Schu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">kill,</HI> besides several Creeks on the Eastern Shore, which will furni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h with vast Quantities, being easily sent down either by Flotes or Rafts at a small Charge; <HI>West-Jersey</HI> being stor'd with Pine for Boards and Ship Timber, and

their Clay-bottom Swamps with noble Timber for Keels and Plank, not inferi|our to any in <HI>America.</HI> And their Cedar Swamps in Time will be a Treasure: Their Pine also is proper for Pitch, Tar, Rozin, as well as Boards, not to omit the com|mon Products of this River, <HI>viz.</HI> Beef, Pork, Butter, Cheese, Bread and Flour which are Staple Merchandize.</P>
<P>Another spontaneous Production of Nature, of which we have a doubtful Prospect of, is Copper, in the Search whereof much Labour, Time and Cost has been spent, as also on Metals of a superiour Value; for strong is the Power of Imagination, that every glistering Stone was thought Gold, and every glaring Thing Silver. But</P>
<P>IRON the most useful of all spon|taneous Production comes next under Consideration. From Experiments made, we have great Plenty, and very good, both for Ship-Work and Husband<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and ought to be particularly encouraged from the certain Assurances it gives of Advan|tages to the Inhabitants of this River in divers Respects.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="002697_0047_0FE60CC5CF8C50F0">No one Metal is so universally service|able and useful to Mankind: For tho' Nature has furnish'd us with Hands, which a great Philosopher has stil'd <HI>The Instrument of Instruments,</HI> how much should we fall short of these excellent Uses and Services Nature has adapted them to, were we deprived or ignorant of this excellent Metal, the Natives here are pregnant Instances thereof.</P>
<P>The judicious <HI>Locke</HI> observes of what Consequence
<Q>the Discovery of one natural Body and its Properties may be to humane Life, the whole great Continent of <HI>America</HI> is a convincing Instance; whose Ignorance in useful Arts, and Want of the greatest Part of the Conveniences of Life, in a Coun|try that abounded with all Sorts of Natural Plenty, I think may be attri|buted to their Ignorance of what may be found in a very ordinary despicable Stone, I mean the Mineral of Iron, and whatever we think of our Parts and Improvement in this Part of the World, where Knowledge and Plenty
<PB N="49" REF="002697_0048_0FE60C70A2C9D2A0">
seem to vie each with other; yet to any one that will seriously reflect on it, I suppose, it will appear past Doubt, that were the Use of Iron lost among us, we should in a few Ages be una|voidably reduced to the Want and Ig|norance of the ancient savage <HI>Ameri|cans,</HI> whose natural Endowments and Provisions, come no Way short of those of the most flourishing and polite Na|tion, so that he who first made known the Use of that once contemptible Me|tal, may be truly stiled <HI>The Father of Arts and the Author of Plenty.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To which we shall add this further Observation in Praise of the Usefulness and universal Benefit of it to Mankind, namely its Magnetism, to which un|doubtedly is owing the Discovery of <HI>A|merica</HI> to the <HI>Europeans</HI>; for how is it possible a Course could be directed thro' the vast Atlantick Ocean without a Com|pass, since Navigation was so difficult to the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> in their narrow Seas? It may not be an idle Speculation to the curious to consider those admira|ble
<PB N="50" REF="002697_0049_0FE60C71B26BCE70">
Qualities of sympathetical Attraction, and Antipathetical Repulsion of the Load-stone, which is a Species of Iron. And here we shall conclude with this Re|mark, that the Manufactury of Iron will employ such a Number of People as will be Consumers of Provision and <HI>English</HI> Goods, as well as Timber, which at pre|sent lies so remote from great Rivers, that in clearing of Land great Quantities are burnt to waste, which now by being ren|dred useful on this Occasion, will be|come valuable, and consequently will proportionably augment the Value of Lands.</P>
<P>This will vastly contribute to the Rich|es of these Countries, we having Plenty of Oak, at least twelve Sorts, tho' the best is that which grows in Clay-Swamps, its Leaf form'd much like the Chesnut, but not so large, for the most Part grow|ing tall, is, (as remark'd) fit for Keels and Plank, with crooked Timber which chiefly grows on Up-Land, (of which White-Oak is the best) being the princi|pal Matter for building of Ships. In like
<PB N="51" REF="002697_0050_0FE60C71C61DA0C8">
Manner, if we attain to Plenty of Iron, we are capable to carry on the Hull with|out any Foreign Materials, as also com|pleat the Tackle and Rigging with Can|vas for Sails. Of what immense Ad|vantage this will be to <HI>America,</HI> is obvi|ous to any one the least skill'd in mari|time Affairs. And we flatter our selves, who ever lives to see half a Century will find a great Part of <HI>Europe</HI> furnish'd with Ships from <HI>America</HI>; and this we dare predict from very probable Grounds and Reasons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> were the People who formerly found it much to their Account to build Ships for other Nations. <HI>France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Eng|land</HI> bought of that Republick, tho' scarce any of the Materials of Building were the Product of their Country; so that they made that Want a Foundation for Trade, and a great Imployment it was to their Ships into the <HI>Baltick</HI> Seas to fetch Timber, Pitch, Tar, Hemp, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lax, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which they manufactured, and by building Shiping, Furniture, Stores
<PB N="52" REF="002697_0051_0FE60C76F4475CA0">
and Victualling, sold to other Nations. <HI>England</HI> indeed out of a just Emulation to the great Advantages accruing to them thereby, and wisely considering how much it would be to the Advantage of the Nation to promote Building of Ships and Navigation, did in Effect prohi|bit Buying of Ships of Foreign Nati|ons, by rendring all Foreign built un|capable to trade to the Plantations, (un|less Plantation-Built) being capable of building her own Ships, having the same or greater Advantages than the <HI>Dutch.</HI> But <HI>France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> are un|der the same Necessity still, and build in <HI>Holland,</HI> and sometimes in <HI>England:</HI> And as Timber in most Parts of <HI>Europe</HI> grows scarce, <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain, &amp;c.</HI> not having sufficient for Cask for their Liquor, it will be soon wasted. Within our Memo|ry, <HI>England</HI> was furnish'd with Ship-Timber and Staves from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and now so great is the Change, that <HI>Ireland</HI> has not for their own Use as appears by the Supplies from this River. Therefore 'tis a strong Presumption the <HI>Europians</HI> must
<PB N="53" REF="002697_0052_0FE60C77076FBF60">
build in some Parts of <HI>America.</HI> And since the Southern Parts have not Plenty of Timber for these Uses, our Northern Parts will be most capable to furnish them with Ships and Ship-Timber.</P>
<P>Hence, if once we are in a Condition to equip from the Growth and Manufac|tory of <HI>America,</HI> as also with Naval Stores, this will be of huge Advantage to the <HI>British-America.</HI></P>
<P>We have been the more prolix on those two Articles, as Matters which very well deserve our most serious Thoughts, much tending to a general and publick Good, as well as to the Farmer, the Merchant, the Artificer, the Baker, the Butcher, the Victualler, with all the nece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sary Trades of which Towns consist; with this fur|ther Remark, that such Numbers of Peo|ple as must necessarily be employed in all the several Occupations depending, will be a great Consumption of the Country-Produce, and by their Labour will render Things of small Value to more conside|rable Worth, which will enable us the better to ballance with those Countries
<PB N="54" REF="002697_0053_0FE60C78CEDF2100">
we trade to, which ought to be our Rule, according to the Examples we have brought to that purpose.</P>
<P>LIME-STONE, we have in great Plenty, of which Store of Lime is made, which gives the Opportunity to the In|habitants to build good Stone and Brick-Houses in Town and Country. Here are late Discoveries of Slate fit for covering Houses, and other Uses, as also Marble, which being polish'd, proves very fine and of beautiful Colours, and may de|servedly compare with most in <HI>Europe,</HI> where 'tis not improbable it may find Ap|plause; and if once it obtains Opinion, it may serve for Merchandize, at least for Ballast.</P>
<P>ISING-GLASS we have also, which may serve for Window-Lights, and is much better for Lanthorns than either Glass or Horn, especially for Ships, it not being affected with Noise of Guns, nor scorch'd with Heat, as the latter is. Here is also Cotton-Stone, of which Handkerchiefs, Gloves or Purses may be knit, and when soul are cleans'd in the
<PB N="55" REF="002697_0054_0FE60C78DEB1AE68">
Fire, which like Gold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t endures it with|out any Change.</P>
<P>What we have now to consider is, PA|PER-MONEY, which, how far it has been conducive to restore Credit, relieve the Exigencies of divers Freeholders and Inhabitants of this Province, and revive the languishing State of Trade, with divers other Advantages, is already intimated. Yet we are not the richer simply by this Paper-Money, otherwise than as it con|duces to those good Ends, it being only a Part of the real Estates we had before, which lay useless as to Trade, and is now turn'd into a trading Currency, to supply the Want of Cash, which (by re|mitting what we had in the Country, and the excessive Use of Foreign Liquors, in|stead of more useful Commodities) we were so far drain'd of, as not to have any Thing like a competent Quantity to main|tain Trade and Credit amongst our selves.</P>
<P>It is then the Produce of our Country, in which our Riches does consist, it be|ing the Foundation of our Trade, and that wherewith we must pay for all man|ner
<PB N="56" REF="002697_0055_0FE60C7DC6D7C520" MS="y">
of foreign Commodities which we want. It is that also which has formerly brought us in Silver and Gold, and may again when we can be so happy as to re|trench the Use of Foreign Liquors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We know some Persons that profess Skill, will tell us this would be a Clog upon Trade: But by their Leave the abundant Use of it has been very destruc|tive to the Welfare of this Province. The Discouragement Foreign Brandy meets with in <HI>Great Britain</HI> is a Clog upon Trade too, but the wise and honourable Legislature there well know it is a Trade that would be no ways advantagious to the publick Interest of the Nation; and if we could have been but so happy as to copy after them so far as to clog the injurious Parts of Trade in Time, and had continued so doing, I suppose we should never had Occasion for a Paper-Currency, (which by former Irregula|rities) is now made so absolutely ne|cessary that Trade and Credit together would inevitably sink without it; and if it be said that we have the Ballance of
<PB N="57" REF="002697_0056_0FE60CC8DFCD5F68" MS="y">
Trade with the <HI>West-Indies</HI> in our Fa|vour, and that some Cash is still brought from thence, it makes but very little for us to have an Hundred Pounds in Cash from those Parts where we send the great|est Part of our Country-Produce, and want a Thousand Pounds elsewhere, (which we take to be near our Case of late Years) and certainly such Trade must end in our own Ruin; for if so much of the Country-Produce, as is exported will not pay for all that is imported, the long|er we trade, the poorer we shall be; we speak of the Publick, for tho' some pri|vate Persons may make a present Advan|tage out of its Ruins, yet they too in their Turn must needs have a Feeling of the publick Calamity. But due Care ought to be had to preserve the Value of our Paper-Currency, otherwise it will prove an Injury to the Creditors, and be an Injustice in the Debtors to pay their Debts in what is not of the Value it ought. But this Inconvenience will easily be a|voided by continuing the Care already ta|ken in the Security, and also restricting
<PB N="58" REF="002697_0057_0FE60C7DD57393C0" MS="y">
the Sum in a due Proportion to the Trade of this River; for a great Excess in that Respect will inevitably debase the Value of it, tho' a reasonable plenty is advan|tageous in encreasing Trade and Naviga|tion, which cannot thrive without it.</P>
<P>The very great Abundance of Silver and Gold in any Place lessens the Value of it, tho' it may still retain the same De|nomination, or be called so much <HI>per</HI> Ounce as it was before, yet a greater Quantity of it must be given for all Ven|dibles. On the other Hand, the too great Scarcity of it enhances its Value by de|basing the Price of Vendibles to the other Extream, that even the Husbandman, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> cannot live by his Labour, for the Scar|city of Cash makes few Buyers, and con|sequently miserable Markets, when other|ways they might be tolerably good.</P>
<P>We are told the <HI>Portuguese</HI> of late re|strain the excessive Quantity of Gold brought from <HI>Brazil</HI> to keep up the Va|lue of it, and that this is no ways impo|litick, let us for once make (what may be thought) an extravagant and wild Hy|pothesis:
<PB N="59" REF="002697_0058_0FE60C7FC1F7A980" MS="y">
Let it be supposed these Coun|tries abounded with Gold Mines, in as great plenty as we have of Iron Stone, we must necessarily conclude, that Gold would lose much of the Value it now bears, and much more if it were confin'd to this River, as our Paper-Credit is, which is a Consequence no ways strain'd, but must be acknowledged by all judici|ous Persons to be self-evident.</P>
<P>Hence we conceive it will be the Pru|dence of those Governments to emit no more Paper-Money than the Trade of these Colonies call for, it being That, which, together with the good Security given by those Persons who take it out of the Offices, will undoubtedly keep up its Value. This, with humble Submission to the Honourable Legislative Bodies in these Colonies is not intended as a Direc|tion, but is humbly offered to their fur|ther Consideration.</P>
<P>The extravagant Exchange that has lately been given for Gold, has been wrongfully charg'd on our Paper-Curren|cy, with this Insinuation, that it was fal|len
<PB N="60" REF="002697_0059_0FE60C7FD503BED8">
so much below the Value it was gi|ven out at, as Gold is advanc'd, where|as it is most evident to have been occasi|on'd by the exceeding Scarcity of Gold, and the great Want of it to make Remit|tances; for when several Persons at one and the same Time were busied in buying up what Gold they could hear of, they advanc'd the Exchange to four Times as much as it was but a short Time before, and could not get <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> much as they would have done neither; which is still a fur|ther Proof of the miserable Circumstan|ces we should have been under without a Paper-Currency, and that very few Pay|ments could have been in Houses, Lands, Stock, Country-Produce, and the like, which could never have been adapted to answer all the Necessities of Trade.</P>
<P>HORSES, the most serviceable of all Animals to the Use of Mankind, we have hitherto omitted. But finding from the Example of some Neighbouring Co|lonies they are proper for Trade, and that great Numbers to a considerable Value, are frequently shipp'd off to the <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="002697_0060_0FE60C8B35339160">
and <HI>Dutch,</HI> as well as <HI>English</HI> Settlements to the Southward, where they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell at great Prices: But then they ought to be of a Breed better than what is common to this River. Therefore it will be of Importance to the Husbandman to meliorate the Breed by getting the best S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">allions, and using such other Care and Diligence as may be necessary to that End; for a low Price J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de will cost as much Provision, Provender and Freight as a Beast worth five Times as much. Hence tis advise|able for such who are well circumstan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and accommodated with good Pasture, to secure to themselves a good Breed both of Horses and Mares; and if the Success an|swers not by shipping off, yet it will be of Advantage to these Colonies to im|prove our Breed for our proper Uses, es|pecially comely and well pac'd Horses for the Saddle. By this Means we shall not need to buy of our Neighbours who drain from us yearly considerable Sums, which by Industry and Care, as above, may be saved: And 'tis not improbable but in Time we may acquire such a Breed
<PB N="62" REF="002697_0061_0FE60C8B4AB36140">
as may be proper for Transportation to those Markets where they are vendible. This only as an Experiment for the Inge|nious and thoughtful Farmer to put in Practice; 'tis Experience must recommend it for a general Service and Advantage to this River.</P>
<P>Having thus far discours'd of most of the Branches of Trade we are capable of, there is yet one great Encouragement, to adventure in the Discovery and Prose|cution of new Markets; more safe to the industrious Adventurer; namely an <HI>Insu|rance-Office</HI> in one or more of these Co|lonies; which is the interesting of divers in the Loss or Profit of a Voyage, and is now become so much the Practice of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> that Insurance may be had in divers Cases as well against the Hazards at Land, as Casualties at Sea, which must be acknowledged not only to be safe, but a great Encouragement to adventure; for it may so happen that a Person may some|time adventure his ALL, and then in case of a Loss he may be rendered unca|pable of a future Trade, to the Disadvan|tage
<PB N="63" REF="002697_0062_0FE60C8C5CB549F8">
of the publick, and (it may be) to the Ruin of himself; whereas could he get a part of his Interest either of Ship or Cargo insured, (tho' in Case of safe Arrival he parts with a part of his Profit, yet) in Case of Loss, he is secur'd of such part as he insureth, which may be a sufficient Bottom to begin a new Adven|ture: How far this may conduce to the Trade of this River, is obvious to any Man of Thought. Now whereas there has been some Attempts made at <HI>Phila|delphia,</HI> which dropt and prov'd abortive, (for what Reasons we never could learn) we humbly propose to the Legislature that an Office be erected and supported by a Fund arising out of the Interest of the Loan-Office. This will be a good and safe Bottom, and cannot be easily over-set by a few Losses; and we conceive will contribute to keep up the Value of our Paper-Credit by promoting of Trade, Navigation and Building of Ships, and in Consequence, of great Advantage to this River: Which we refer to the Con|sideration of the Merchant.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="002697_0063_0FE60C8C725A6950">AND now for a Close to this Es|say, from a Consideration of the Causes of the Decay of Trade and the languish|ing Condition of the Country; the Ways and Means of Redress will not be found very difficult, much less impos|sible, if happily the Premises be duly observed: For as in Diseases of the Na|tural Body, the Knowledge of the Cause is half the Cure, so there needs no other Direction but a diligent Application to correct those noxious Humours which continue to feed the Distemper, of which having as fully discuss'd as the intended Brevity would admit, we refer back there|unto, tho' we think this short Summary may not be altogether improper.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Ballance of Trade is es|sentially necessary to restore us to our former flourishing Condition.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Encouragement of Manufac|tury, Trade and Navigation, and raising the Value of our Country-Produce.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="65" REF="002697_0064_0FE60C9272AAD340">3. This can be attain'd only by find|ing new Markets.</P>
<P N="4">4. As necessary thereunto the Farmer must endeavour the raising all the va|rious Species of Growths these Coun|tries are capable of, as the necessary Funds for a flourishing Trade.</P>
<P>AND here we address our selves to the Farmer, that as 'tis by his Diligence and Industry that this River must be fur|nish'd with a Stock for Trade, whether of Beef, Pork, Grain, Bread or Flour, as becomes honest Men, who value the Credit of their Country. Let those se|veral Commodities be well saved, well pack'd, sound and merchantable, this will tend to their Honour and Interest: And to all worthy and generous Mer|chants, that they would abstract from private Views, and prosecute such Trade as may be beneficial for the publick, as well as themselves.</P>
