<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>PSAL. CXVI.15.</BIBL>
<P>Precious in the Sight of the LORD, is the Death of his Saints.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Words indeed are found in the midst of a Song of Praise: and it seems not easy to descern their Con|nection, either with what goes before or follows them. For the Psalmist was Blessing the MOST HIGH for hearing his earnest Prayer and delivering his Soul from Death: and as He is uttering his Resolution to pay his Vows in the Presence of all his People &mdash; He suddenly brakes forth in this surprizing Exclamation &mdash; <HI>Precious in the Sight of the LORD is the Death of his Saints</HI>&mdash; and then goes on with his grateful Promises to serve and honour his Divine Preser|ver.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003955_0004_10037C0B4DC90D80">Perhaps He had his Eye on the <HI>vain Imagina|tion</HI> of those who think the Glorious GOD to be an unconcerned Spectator of the dangerous Case and Death even of the Best of the Race of Men; that He has no regard to their Cries in their Times of Danger; that He leaves them to the Chance of natural Causes; that whether they live or dye, 'tis a trifling or indifferent matter with HIM; that as all things in the present State seem to come alike to all, both to the Good and Bad, so He makes no more account of the Life or Death of the one than of the other; and that therefore there is no need of acknowledging his particular Providence, either in the Death or Pre|servation of the <HI>Saints</HI> themselves.</P>
<P>In opposition to such wrong Tho'ts as these, which are apt to rise in the sensitive Minds of Men, the Psalmist here declares his assured Judg|ment in the words before us. Wherein are comprehended these two <HI>Propositions,</HI> viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>That even the</HI> Saints of GOD <HI>are subject to</HI> Dye, <HI>as well as others.</HI> But</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>In this they differ, that their</HI> Death <HI>is</HI> Pre|cious <HI>in the Sight of their</HI> LORD.</ITEM>

<P>And for the clearing them I shall endeavour to consider these four Things,

<ITEM>2. On what account are they called HIS <HI>Saints,</HI></ITEM>

<P>A learned Man observes, the Word imports, both Piety, Probity, Goodness, Benevolence, Benignity and Beneficence. In Humane Kind it sometimes sig|nifies the Goodliness or Good which we receive, as in <HI>Isai.</HI> 40.6. at other times the Pious &amp; benign Affecti|on, wherewith we do Good to others. Sometimes the <HI>Septuagint</HI> translates the word by&mdash;<HI>Righteous</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. 32.10. Exod. 34.7. Isai. 63.7. Esther 2.9.</NOTE> ; Sometimes by <HI>Grace,</HI> but usually by <HI>Mercy</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Psal. 4.4. Neh. 13.14.</NOTE> ; which the <HI>New Testament</HI> allows <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mat. 9.13. Hos. 6.6.</NOTE>. Hence the Godly are called Gracious or Merciful; viz. Those that have obtained Mercy, Goodness, Piety, Grace and Benignity from GOD, and are Pious also towards HIM, as well as Gracious, kind and merciful to <HI>others.</HI> (<HI>Leigh.</HI> Crit.)</P>
<P>In the</P>
<P N="1">1. Place then, By the <HI>Saints</HI> are here intended, <HI>Those who are Sanctified by the</HI> HOLY SPIRIT.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003955_0006_10037C1031C11F20">They are not meerly <HI>nominal</HI> but <HI>real</HI> Saints; truly Sanctified or made Holy, both in Spirit, Soul and Body. And as in the OEconomy of our Redemption, the SON OF GOD was to <HI>Purchase</HI> all Kinds of Blessings for guilty and condemned Sinners; the HOLY SPIRIT was to <HI>apply</HI> these Blessings, and among the rest this great one of Sanctification to their depraved Natures.</P>
<P>As we derive from <HI>Adam,</HI> both the inspired Scriptures show us, and our universal, constant Observation both of our selves and others, abun|dantly confirms it, that the present Constitution of the whole Race of Men, is in a moral sense, exceedingly depraved, as they are now formed or come into the World. If in a moral sense, our Natures were neither Good nor Evil, but equally indifferent to both; there wou'd be an equal chance for an equal Number of Virtuous and Vicious People on the Face of the Earth, or in every Country. But the Experience of all Na|tions, Ages and Countries shows us, that the Vir|tuous are comparatively few: And even these Virtuous Ones have for ever owned, and have often indeed unhappily discovered the Vicious Inclinations in them.</P>
<P>Even <HI>Socrates</HI> Himself, one of the best and wisest among the Gentiles &mdash; when a Teller of Secrets that knew not who he was, nor what Life he liv'd; yet from viewing the Lines of his Face, pronounced, that whoever He was, He was a Per|son full of vicious Inclinations; the People laugh'd to see the Man's great mistake in a Person of such transcendent Virtue: But <HI>Socrates</HI> cries out, <HI>The Man is right: I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> them all by nature in me,
<PB N="5" REF="003955_0007_10037C74773FC4B0">
and 'tis only by the Power of Wisdom, that I have cor|rected, &amp; kept them under.</HI> (Cicero <HI>Tusc. &amp; Lib.</HI> IV.)</P>
<P><HI>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one: What then is Man that he should be clean? and He who is born of a Woman that he shou'd be Righteous?</HI> So say <HI>Job, Eliphaz,</HI> and <HI>Bildad,</HI> those most pious and wise <HI>Arabians</HI>; who lived in the early Ages before the Giving of the Law by <HI>Moses,</HI> in some of the purest Times the Earth has seen, and were as thoroughly acquainted with Humane Nature as any others. <HI>David</HI> one of the holiest among the ancient <HI>Israelites,</HI> confesses, and would have all observe it, that He was <HI>conceiv'd in Sin and shapen in Iniquity,</HI> Psal. 51.5. And GOD Himself, who knows us perfectly, declares, that <HI>the Imagination of Man's Heart is Evil from his Youth,</HI> Gen. 8.21.</P>
<P>To be <HI>conceived in Sin and shapen in Iniquity,</HI> is to be conceiv'd and shapen with prevailing Pro|pensities to sinful Pleasures, and to sinful Tho'ts Contrivances and Actions, in order to obtain those sinful Pleasures. Our sinful Nature with its sinful Byasses, are derived from the Parent to the Offspring: And how this <HI>moral Propagation</HI> is re|concileable with the moral <HI>Purity</HI> of our CREATOR, is as easy to be apprehended, as how the Propa|gation of painful and vile Diseases, is reconcilea|ble to his <HI>Justice.</HI></P>
<P>For, in short, the Sovereign GOD at first form|ed a wise and righteous <HI>Course of Nature,</HI> wherein He would ordinarily extend his Influence; but would not be obliged to hinder Men from per|verting from its excellent Ends. He will usually still act according to this Course of Nature: and
<PB N="6" REF="003955_0008_10037C17366673E0">
if Men pervert it, the Sin and Blame derives from them, and not from Him, who requires their act|ing otherwise.</P>
<P>So in this Course of Nature, He for excellent Ends, enables the Soul within us to move the Bo|dy. But if the Soul will move the Body to a vile Action; the Sovereign GOD is not obliged to change the Course of Nature, or work a Miracle, or operate in a different manner; but still he ena|bles the Soul to move the Body; and the Sin and Fault intirely belongs to the vile Perverter.</P>
<P>So in the Course of Nature, for excellent Ends, the Sovereign GOD has given various Vertues to various Meats and Liquors, and various Relishes to move our temperate using them, for our Bene|fit and Comfort. But when the intemperate Ap|petite immoderately swallows them; He is not obliged to change the Course of Nature, or work a Miracle to hinder their natural Operation, tho' the excessive Liquor should inebriate, or the pro|voking Meat inflame a vicious Appetite. The Sovereign GOD is absolutely Spotless: and the Sin and Blame intirely lies on the vile Abuser of the Divine Power and Influence.</P>
<P>However, this we see in <HI>Fact,</HI> that upon the Sin of our first Parents, the Humane Nature be|came wretchedly depraved &amp; corrupted. <HI>Before the Flood</HI> we read, that <HI>GOD looked upon the Earth, and behold it was corrupt; For all Flesh had cor|rupted his Way upon the Earth,</HI> Gen. vi.12. In the Times of <HI>David</HI> we also read, that the <HI>LORD looked down from Heaven upon the Children of Men, to see if there were any that did understand and seek GOD</HI>; But <HI>they were all gone aside, they were al|together
<PB N="7" REF="003955_0009_10037C505F9D1FD8">
become filthy, there was none that did Good, no not one,</HI> Psal. 14.1, 2 In the Days of the <HI>A|postles,</HI>&mdash; 1 Joh. 5.19, <HI>And we know &mdash; that the whole World lieth in Wickedness.</HI> So universal was this Corruption then; so universal has it been ever since; and so universal is it now, that 'tis nothing but our Ignorance of the State of Hu|mane Kind that suffers us to imagine otherwise.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Minds</HI> are now by nature Blind, that we cannot see the transcendent Excellence and Love|liness of GOD; we cannot apprehend our high|est Delight and only Happiness consisteth in the Knowledge of Him, in being like Him in his mo|ral Excellence, in conversing with Him, in con|forming to his Will, and in promoting his Glory. Our <HI>Affections</HI> are so depraved; that we cannot love Him with the highest Love, nor desire Him with the highest Desire, nor delight in Him with the highest Satisfaction. And our <HI>Wills</HI> are so perverted, that we cannot chuse nor seek Him as our only allsufficient Portion, nor intirely submit to his Sovereign Pleasure.</P>
<P>But instead of this, we delight in and value, we love and desire, we chuse and seek the World before Him. And because He forbids or hinders us herein; we rise in Enmity and Opposition to Him, we hate his Holy Laws and Government, we will not have Him to rule over us, we re|nounce our Subjection to Him, and set up our selves against Him.</P>
<P>In such a Case as this are the Children of Men by Nature. And so the <HI>Apostle</HI> describes them in <HI>Rom.</HI> iii.9,&mdash;23. <HI>Chap.</HI> vii.17. and <HI>Chap.</HI> viii.7. But when the DIVINE SPIRIT comes
<PB N="8" REF="003955_0010_10037C1EE81F2DE0">
to Sanctify us; He enlightens our Minds, and gives us the highest Apprehensions of the Glorious GOD; He purifies our Affections and sets them chiefly on Him; He renews our Wills, and brings them to a cordial Submission to Him. He deadens our Lusts; He delivers us from these sinful By|asses; And in the room of them He puts a con|trary and prevailing Byass towards that in|finitely GREATEST and BEST of Beings, as our highest Good, and only Happiness. He enlivens us with every gracious Principle that makes us like Him in his moral Image, and prevailingly inclines and moves us to obey his Will and seek his Glory. He subjects every Passion to the en|lightened Judgment: And now they receive their Motion, Direction or Restraint from those holy Principles and Inclinations He has produced and constantly preserveth in us.</P>
<P>He brings us to see the Vileness of every Sin and hate it; to mourn for all our Contrariety to GOD and Dishonours done Him; to reject every sinful Pleasure and Inclination; to implore his Pardon and Favour through CHRIST the Me|diator; to embrace the Saviour in all his Offices and Promises; Receiving Him, submitting to Him and depending on Him for all the Benefits of his meritorious Obedience and prevailing In|tercession. He brings us heartily to love and chuse his Word and Truths, his Laws and Go|vernment, his House and Ordinances; and to de|vote our selves intirely to Him. In short, He brings us to take the greatest Pleasure in Conver|sing with Him, and in our own and others Con|formity to his Will and Image. He brings us to delight in Goodness wherever we see it, to love our Neighbours with a kind affection, to desire
<PB N="9" REF="003955_0011_10037C7D457F97C0">
their welfare, and even aspire to be Blessings to all about us.</P>
<P>These are the <HI>internal</HI> Characters and Princi|ples of the <HI>Saints</HI> of GOD: They are thus in|wardly Sanctified by his HOLY SPIRIT: He has renewed his Sacred Image in them; and given them a vital Power to move and act in an Holy manner like Him.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Saints</HI> of GOD are therefore <HI>Those who also live in a sanctified or holy manner.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>Hearts</HI> being thus made Holy with holy Frames and Byasses; these holy &amp; active Principles put forth themselves in holy <HI>Lives.</HI></P>
<P>They Persevere and Grow in every Grace: and from these vital Powers yield the Fruits of Ho|liness. Their inward Graces rise up in holy Tho'ts, form their Minds into holy Affections and Intentions, express themselves in holy Words, and exert themselves in holy Actions.</P>
<P>They watch over themselves: They watch a|gainst the Snares about them: They consider their Duty both to GOD and <HI>Man:</HI> They have a respect to all the Divine Commands, and labour to perform them.</P>
<P>They deny all Ungodliness and worldly Lusts. They are wise and tho'tful, grave and chearful, pure and modest, temperate and sober; and they possess their Vessels in Chastity and Honour.</P>
<P>They espouse the Cause of Piety, tho' despis'd by others. They are not ashamed to profess their Faith in GOD, nor in his revealed Word, nor in
<PB N="10" REF="003955_0012_10037C2824413060">
that Blessed SAVIOUR which others slight: But they openly own Him, and declare their Resolu|tion to obey and follow Him. They make his Doctrines their Rule of Faith, his Precepts their Rule of Life and Worship, his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> their Pattern, and his Glory their End. They sancti|fy his Name and Sabbath: They encourage and respect his Ministers: They love his Ordinances, and they carefully attend them both in Publick and Private.</P>
<P>But a distinguishing Part of their external Cha|racter is their GOODNESS to <HI>others.</HI> Their Concern to fulfil the Duties of their several Places and Re|lations: Their becoming Carriage both to Supe|riours, Equals and Inferiours: Their Justice and Honesty, their Mildness and Gentleness, their Kindness and Beneficence to all about them. Their Pity to the Afflicted, their Help to the Needy, their Charity to those who are of other Opinions, their manifest Abhorrence of every vicious thing, their distinguishing Approbation of every thing that's Good; their Displeasure at the Wicked, and their peculiar Favour to the Wise and Virtuous.</P>
<P>In short, <HI>Goodness</HI> or <HI>Beneficence</HI> is so essential and great a Part of the Character of the <HI>Saints</HI> of GOD, that <HI>not they</HI> deserve the sacred Name who shut themselves in Cloisters or mostly spend their Lives in retir'd Devotions; <HI>But they</HI> who desire and labour to Do most Good are the great|est Saints. They are most like to the Holy GOD who does Good to all and who does Good con|tinually, who is never weary and who is never wanting, who is never backward, and who will do Good for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="003955_0013_10037C805FDC6328">Thus have we considered briefly our First General Head, and in some measure shown the Character of the <HI>Saints</HI> of GOD here spoken of. And by these things we may clearly see</P>
<P N="2">II. On what Accounts They are called HIS <HI>Saints</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>I may but mention them, and so pass on&mdash; And they may be such as these, viz.</P>
<P>Because they receive their Sanctification from Him, both in the Beginning, Continuance, Pro|gress, and Perfection of it.</P>
<P>Because, by their being Holy both in Heart and Life, They are like Him in his moral Excellence.</P>
<P>Because they are therein conformable to his Holy Will &amp; Law, and answer the excellent De|signs of the many Powers and Opportunities He has bestowed on them.</P>
<P>Because They are the Objects of his special Favour, Delight and Love.</P>
<P>And lastly, Because He has taken them into an happy Relation to Him as his peculiar People, by a perfectly well ordered and everlasting Covenant.</P>
<P>On such Accounts as these they are styled <HI>His,</HI> with a special Eminence &amp; Appropriation. And yet <HI>these</HI> alass! must <HI>Dye</HI> as well as others! But</P>
<P N="3">III. Why are not these Saints of his <HI>excused</HI> from <HI>this deplorable Calamity.</HI></P>
<P>Now this in General is for the same Reasons that they are ordered to meet with other Temporal Evils.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="003955_0014_10037C2DC3EC5178">It is doubtless in Part to signify, that they are all involv'd with their intire Fellow-Race in the first Apostacy.</P>
<P>It is to show the natural, pernicious and deadly Influence of Sin in their depraved Natures.</P>
<P>It is to exhibit to the World in them, the more flagrant Instances of the Divine Justice, Holiness and Truth, the Desert of Sin and its great offen|siveness to GOD.</P>
<P>It is to avoid those many Inconveniencies, which their Exemption from the common Lot of others, either by a perpetual Life, or their distin|guishing Translation, would subject the World unto.</P>
<P>It is to keep them humble, excite their Dili|gence, Fidelity and Watchfulness, to try and ex|ercise and improve their Faith, Submission, Pati|ence, and other Graces, for the Excitation of all who see them, and for their own greater Benefit.</P>
<P>It is to show the superior Excellence of his true Religion in them, and to magnify his Grace in giving them a joyful Triumph over Nature in the nearest Prospect of this King of Terrors.</P>
<P>And in fine, it is to give Occasion for the more illustrious Appearance of the Power and Empire of the Redeemer in their amazing Resurrection.</P>
<P>For these and it may be numberless other Rea|sons, which are unreveal'd and we can little think of; the Saints of GOD, tho' sanctified and for|given, tho' they are his peculiar People and most dear to Him; yet must suffer Death as well as
<PB N="13" REF="003955_0015_10035CF61CC70CD8">
others, and are expos'd to encounter it in all its hideous Forms and killing Agonies.</P>
<P>But we must now consider the <HI>Special Privilege</HI> here ascribed to them; or in the</P>
<P N="4">IV. and last place show, In what Respect their <HI>Death</HI> is <HI>Precious in the Sight of their LORD.</HI></P>
<P>Now this plainly implies that their <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Lives</HI> are Precious to Him. Thus He represents them as his <HI>Jewels,</HI> Mal. iii.17. as his <HI>peculiar Treasure,</HI> Exod. xix.5. Psal. CXXXV.4; and as his <HI>pleasant Portion,</HI> Jer. 12.10. As a <HI>chosen Ge|neration,</HI> 1 Pet. ii.9. as his <HI>peculiar People,</HI> Deut. xiv.2. Isai. li.16. &amp; 1 Pet. ii.9; as his <HI>Chil|dren,</HI> Mat. v.9; as his <HI>Beloved,</HI> Psal. cviii.6; and <HI>the dearly Beloved of his Soul,</HI> Jer. xii.7. That He <HI>taketh Pleasure</HI> in them, Psal. cxlix.4. that whosoever toucheth them, toucheth <HI>the Apple of his Eye,</HI> Zech. ii.8. and as <HI>the Apple of his Eye</HI> He keeps them, Deut. xxxii.10.</P>
<P>By these endearing Epithets, He signifies that He most highly values <HI>Them</HI>; that He watches over them with a special tender Care; and that He will not easily or lightly suffer them to be hurt or perish.</P>
<P>Yea, that He accounts <HI>their Lives</HI> as singularly Useful to Him. The Life of one of these is more preferable with Him than the Lives of many others. The Lives of others are full of Vanity and Folly; and therefore of little worth in the sight of GOD: But the Life of one of these abounds in Good Fruit and Wisdom. The Lives of others are full of Sin and Injury: But the Life of one of these abounds in Righteousness
<PB N="14" REF="003955_0016_10037C379FA793A0">
and Beneficence. The Lives of others highly dishonour and offend the Sovereign GOD: But the Lives of these greatly please Him, and yield Him Glory.</P>
<P>On these and other Accounts, their <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Lives</HI> are Precious to Him. So Precious, as to be highly valued and carefully Preserved, as long as his own Glory and their best Interest require it.</P>
<P>And as their <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Lives</HI> are Precious in the Sight of GOD, their <HI>Death</HI> must needs be Pre|cious with Him too. He makes not light, i.e. He makes no small Account of the Death of his Saints; but He accounts them dear and of the greatest moment to Him. He does not carelesly let them Die: He only suffers it for wiser Ends and for their greater Benefit, than if they were to conti|nue longer.</P>
<P>In particular,</P>
<P N="1">1. They are so Precious to Him, as He allows them <HI>not to Die</HI> before the <HI>fittest Time,</HI> both for HIMSELF and <HI>Them.</HI></P>
<P>His eternal and consummate Wisdom, before He gave them Being, both mark'd the Time of their Entrance and Continuance in this lower World. He design'd them a Work to Do; He designed all their Services, both for Himself, for Others and Themselves, before He made them. And when He brings them forth to Being, He forms them for their Work, and He orders all the Circumstances of their Existence Here in a per|fect Concurrence with it. He introduces them into their various Powers, Places and Opportunities of Service: He constantly upholds their Lives. In
<PB N="15" REF="003955_0017_10037C86135AF4C0">
innumerable Hazards both unknown and known, He defends from Death; and He will not suffer them to Die, till their Work is ended, and the fittest Time arrives, which even They them|selves, if they knew all things, would chuse for their Departure.</P>
<P N="2">2. In their <HI>very Dying</HI> They are Precious to Him.</P>
<P>In the midst of all their Throws and Agonies, the Horrors of the Shadow of Death; and in the midst of their Infirmities, Impatience and Imper|fections, the Weakness of their Faith and the Greatness of their Doubts, Perplexities and Fears, He yet highly values them. He sees and values even the faintest Lines of his Image in them. He sees &amp; values the smallest Measures of their Faith and Hope in Him, of their Love and Desire to Him, of their Meekness and Humility, of their Patience and Submission, of their Fears to offend Him, of their Endeavours to obey his Will and honour Him. He considers their unhappy Dark|ness and Infirmity: He greatly Pities them in their dying Agonies: and then especially they are Precious to Him.</P>
<P>At such a time, They are very dear to their Earthly Relatives and Friends, who can only guess at their internal Pains and Troubles. But they are much more dear to their HEAVENLY FATHER and Compassionate SAVIOUR, who clearly see and know their innermost Distresses both of Soul and Body.</P>
<P N="3">3. He most gratefully accepts <HI>the Death</HI> they humbly submit unto, as a <HI>precious Sacrifice</HI> offer|ed to Him.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="003955_0018_10037C392384AE90">Willingly to yield to Death, when the Lord of Life requires it, is to offer up the precious Life as a Sacrifice to Him: and with what a grateful Acceptance must He behold the Offering? For <HI>Life</HI> is the most precious thing we can con|ceive: as without it we can enjoy no Delight, we can be sensible of nothing, our very Being is of no Advantage: And when we willingly re|sign the Life to the Divine Requirer, we offer Him the dearest thing we have, yea we offer Him all; we offer Him every Enjoyment we have in Possession, and we trust Him wholly for a future Existence. How great must the Offer be for <HI>Us,</HI> and how dear to <HI>HIM</HI> who sees our intire Devotion to his Sovereign Pleasure. And when He sees the Life resigned and the Body Dead; He beholds and values the Sacrifice which has been offered to Him, as transcendently Dear and Precious.</P>
<P N="4">4. Their Death is so Precious to Him, that when they Die, He <HI>suffers them not to Perish</HI> with Others.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Bodies</HI> indeed are suffered to loose their Sense and see Corruption: But their inconcei|vably more noble Part their <HI>Souls</HI> are not allowed to Perish as the Spirits of the unsanctified are. The <HI>unsanctified Spirits</HI> are not only separated wholly from the Life of GOD, or from all chear|ful Influence from Him; but they are also sent into a State of Darkness and Distress, with tre|mendous Devils, as it were imprisoned and wrapt in Chains for the Judgment of the Great Day. Even their Hope is Perished: and without the least Ray of Light or Comfort, they have no|thing left them but <HI>a certain fearful Looking for
<PB N="17" REF="003955_0019_10037C8AE3EA4E30">
of Judgment and fiery Indignation</HI> to <HI>devour</HI> them. Heb. x.27.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Souls</HI> of the <HI>Sanctified</HI> are neither suf|fered to perish from the Life of GOD, nor to pass into a State of Pain nor Horror, nor yet of Fear or Doubt or Insensibility. But they are per|fected in the Life of Grace; they are filled with Divine Light and Joy; and they enter into <HI>Pa|radise,</HI> a Place and State of most sensible Rest, and of inexpressible Delight and Blessedness.</P>
<P N="5">5. Their Death is so Precious in the Sight of their LORD, that even <HI>in the State of Death,</HI> They are <HI>wholly</HI> Precious to Him.</P>
<P>While the <HI>Bodies</HI> of the <HI>Unsanctified</HI> lie putrify|ing in vile Corruption, loathsome to GOD and Angels as well as Men; their <HI>unsanctified Souls</HI> remain in all the Filthiness of Sin and Devils, fit only for their unclean Company, and hateful in the Eyes of GOD. But the <HI>Souls</HI> of the <HI>Sanctified</HI> not only retain their Holiness, but even in the Moment of their Separation their Remains of Sin are intirely done away, they are made perfectly Pure and Holy; and so the Holy GOD beholds them with full Delight, He highly values them as fitted for his immediate Presence. And tho' their Bodies are allowed to putrify and turn to Dust; yet these lamentable Ruins of their Nature, even their corrupting Bodies and their mouldering Dust, are Precious to Him. He will not loose nor leave them; but reserve and keep them as the dear Re|mains of his Beloved Friends; or as the choice Materials of a glorious Temple, which He de|signs to raise and dwell in for ever. Even in the State of Death He esteems them as his dispersed
<PB N="18" REF="003955_0020_10037C3D82CDC9E8">
<HI>Jewels,</HI> and designs a Day when He will make them up into a Crown of Glory. <HI>Mal.</HI> iii.17.</P>
<P N="6">6. Their Death is so Precious with Him, that He will perfectly <HI>Redeem them from it,</HI> and from all its Influence and Power.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bodies</HI> of the <HI>Unsanctified</HI> shall indeed rise again, but in all the sinful Vileness wherewith they died. Their unsanctified <HI>Souls</HI> shall also be restored to them, but with all that increase of Sin they have been growing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">o in their State of Sepe|ration and in their Converse with unclean Spirits. Such a Resurrection cannot be called a Redemp|tion; no more than the bringing forth the known Criminals from Prison to their expected Con|demnation: No! tho' they rise, they rise in Chains; tho' they are brought forth to Light, they would fain fly it; their Light is ten thou|sand times worse than Darkness, and they are brought forth bound for the most open Shame and Punishment.</P>
<P>But not so the <HI>Sanctified</HI>&mdash;their dissolved Bodies and their scattered Dust shall be recollected and form'd again, but free from Sin and fit to join their pure and perfect Spirits. And then free from Guilt and Fear, they'd quicken and rise with Joy unspeakable, full of Liberty and full of Glory.</P>
<P N="7">7. &amp; lastly, Their Death is so Precious to Him, as He will <HI>gloriously Reward it</HI> as the Final Trial and Victory of their Faith, their Love, their Pa|tience, and the Consummation of their Work in this lower World.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="003955_0021_10035CF91D5C1530">When the <HI>Sanctified</HI> come to <HI>Dye,</HI> then comes on the last and greatest Trial of their Faith in GOD and of their Love and Obedience to Him. Their Warfare is now accomplishing, their Course is Finishing, their Probation ending: and now their Love is to mount above the World, their Patience is to overcome their sharpest Sufferings, and their Faith to rise above their final Enemy. In the Power of these Divine Graces they main|tain the hardy Conflict, and they come off Con|querors and more than Conquerors over all Oppo|sition.</P>
<P>Now the Eyes of their gracious GOD is on them: He beholds the Contest and the noble Efforts of their Faith and Love with Pleasure: He sees their Patience in its last and perfect Work: He rejoyces in the glorious Victory: He loves and prizes them as his faithful and victorious People, and He will give them a tran|scendent Recompence. He receives them into his Heavenly Kingdom, He crowns them with Eter|nal Life, He transports them with his joyous Smiles in the Face of CHRIST, and He entertains them with endless Blessedness.</P>
<P>In these Respects the Death of the Saints are Precious in the Sight of their LORD. We might have enlarged on these and mentioned others; but the Time calls us to a brief</P>
<P>IMPROVEMENT.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Then it greatly concerns us to be <HI>Sanctified too.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="003955_0022_10037C41EAED4DB8">For till we come to be Sanctified by the SPIRIT of GOD, we are so far from being Precious in his Holy Eyes, that we are exceeding odious and contemptible to Him. Whatever splendid Titles, exalted Honours, plenteous Riches, or superior Powers we are now invested with; He sees our Hearts, with all the trifling Thoughts and vile Affections brooding there.&mdash; He sees them with Abhorrence and Contempt. Both while we Live and when we Die He loaths us. At Death He strips of all this gay Attire; and when we come to awake and rise, He will then openly despise our Image. He only uses us at present to answer some of his wise Designs; but at the Hour of Death, as mean and worthless He re|jects for ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. When we see the <HI>Sanctified,</HI> we shou'd <HI>highly value and love them.</HI></P>
<P>Since they are Precious in the Sight of GOD, to be sure they should be so in <HI>our</HI>'s. Whatever unworthy Names they bare from their reviling Neighbours; yet as far as they show the <HI>Holy Image</HI> of GOD, we shou'd view it as a lovely Appearance, and our Hearts should rise in Af|fection to them. We should esteem their Persons, prefer their Company, desire their Friendship, avoid their Offence, and wish their Welfare. And surely of all other People on Earth we shou'd make choice of those we apprehend are Precious in the Eyes of GOD, for our <HI>most dear Compa|nions</HI> Here, with whom we are like to find a sacred Fellowship, and with whom we may expect to dwell, and delight in for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="003955_0023_10037C8C865ED430">To chuse for our <HI>most intimate Companions</HI> Here, the <HI>Unsanctified,</HI> who are under the Power of their vile Lusts, and who will not join with us in a Religious Life; who are contemptible and hateful to the Holy GOD, whom at the <HI>Resurrection</HI> we shall relinquish as utterly unfit for our Society, and in the <HI>Judgment</HI> condemn to an eternal Separation from us &mdash; How absurd the <HI>Union?</HI> How inconsistent with the Rules of Wisdom? and what a constant Source of shock|ing Thoughts will this produce in the Pious Soul unhappily consorted with the graceless Sinner as long as Life continues, and then to part for ever. But what a constant Scene of Satisfacti|on, to be join'd with those who are <HI>Beloved of GOD</HI> and Helpers with us to the Heavenly Pla|ces? whom Death it self will separate but for a little Season, and then to meet with improved Loveliness and Purity, never to Part again, but eternally rejoyce together in the grateful Me|mory of all the mutual Helps we have given each other to this endless Blessedness.</P>
<P N="3">3. What a <HI>Sacred Pleasure</HI> is it then to behold the <HI>Saints</HI> both <HI>Dying</HI> and <HI>Expired,</HI> and what a Fountain here of <HI>living Consolations</HI> in the Pros|pect of them.</P>
<P>When we consider our selves indeed as being bereaved, or when we view them in their dying Agonies, with an Eye of <HI>Sense</HI> alone; we have before us very moving Objects of Grief &amp; Tears. But while by <HI>Faith</HI> we view them even then as Precious in the Sight of GOD; while we view their <HI>Souls</HI> as passing out of a World of Sin and Trou|ble into a World of Purity and Blessedness; and while we view even their deceased <HI>Bodies</HI> as also
<PB N="22" REF="003955_0024_10037C44F36F28F8">
Precious in the Eyes of their Redeemer, and as design'd for a Glorious Resurrection; then our Sorrow sinks away, and a holy Pleasure rises, which inclines us rather to Congratulate their Happiness, and wish to follow them.</P>
<P>To see an expiring <HI>Saint,</HI> and then to think, O there's a Precious <HI>Soul</HI> most dear to GOD, a going to be delivered out of Prison; to be loosened from this unweildy, painful and sinful Body; to be perfected in Holiness; to be awakened in all its amazing Powers, to be fill'd with Life, and to stretch away with <HI>Guardian An|gels</HI> to the <HI>Seats above</HI> &mdash; And to see the <HI>Body</HI> lying Pale and Dead, and then to think, O there's a Body still most dear to Heaven; which will one Day be formed again, but in perfect Purity and Beauty; which with wondrous Joy will feel its Glorified <HI>Spirit</HI> Entring and Possessing it, anima|ting every Part, and filling it with Divine Powers and with Immortality &mdash; I say to view these things with an Eye of <HI>Faith,</HI> will carry the Mind into such a Scene of Pleasure, as will banish all our Worldly Grief; and when returning, will both moderate and sanctify our Sorrows.</P>
<P N="4">4. and lastly, Then both while the <HI>Sanctified</HI> are <HI>Living</HI> and when they are <HI>Dead,</HI> we shou'd <HI>call to mind and imitate their various Excellencies.</HI></P>
<P>While they <HI>Live</HI> we shou'd eye their Graces and Good Words; not to lessen them, or raise up in us the vile and hateful Spirit of Envy, but to attract our Love and Imitation.</P>
<P>And when they are <HI>Dead</HI> we should remember these Precious Ones with a sacred Pleasure, speak
<PB N="23" REF="003955_0025_10035CFC2C023470">
of their Excellencies, and excite our selves to copy after them; that we may live and shine as they have done before us, and if possible excel them.</P>
<P>Such an imitable and lovely Pattern has Madam OLIVER set before us.&mdash; A lovely Pattern of a blameless and agreable Life from her Youthful Days: &mdash; a Life adorned in an eminent measure with many Christian Virtues, which attracted the Esteem and Love of all about Her.</P>
<P>I shall mention but a few of the many; because on such Occasions I wou'd always rather chuse to keep within than go beyond the known Cha|racter.</P>
<P>The GOD of Nature seem'd remarkably to fit Her for <HI>that excellent Person</HI> to whom she was associated, whose Loss we yet deplore, and for that honourable Station in which He placed Her.</P>
<P>Innocence and decent Chearfulness were among her lower Virtues. A rare <HI>Wisdom</HI> dwelt in her tho'tful Mind; which constantly appear|ed in her Looks, Deportment, Words, and Actions.</P>
<P>Quick in Apprehending, acute in Judging, lively and easy in Expression; knowing both what and when to speak; free and impartial in expressing her Mind; without Deceit or Flattery, which were greatly abhorrent to her upright Soul: Ready to give her wise and faithful Counsels and Admonitions, &amp; to do good Offices to all about Her.</P>
<P>She always carried Her self agreeably to the Dignity of her honourable and wealthy Circum|stance;
<PB N="24" REF="003955_0026_10037C4A80B8FF60">
yet not with Haughtiness of Air, but with becoming Modesty and Condescention, and without Offence. She was of a tender Heart; full of Mercy and Good Works.</P>
<P>Her witty, easy and free Conversation made her Company very agreable: But in all She ever shew'd a due Regard to the Rules of her Holy Religion, and carefully preserved Her self within them.</P>
<P>She kept her Houshold in excellent Order. She was both an happy Help &amp; Crown to her Husband. She with Him trained up their Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD. She set a lovely Example of all Good Works and Virtues before their Eyes. Her Family was such a Nur|ser, b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Genteel and Virtuous Accomplish|ments the Ministers in the Country were glad to have their Daughters placed in it for the perfecting of their Education.</P>
<P>She lov'd the Habitation of the House of GOD, and his own Institutions there, with the Dispen|sers of them; and She constantly attended them with becoming Reverence.</P>
<P>The following Passages of the Virtuous Woman were most exactly described in her Life and Con|duct&mdash;<HI>While her Husband was known in the Gates, while He sat among the Elders of the Land; his Heart safely trusted in Her, so that He had no need of Spoil. She did Him Good and not Evil all the Days of his Life. She looked well to the Ways of her Houshold, and eat not the Bread of Idleness. She opened her Mouth with Wisdom, and in her Tongue was the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">aw of Kindness. She stretched out her Hand to
<PB N="25" REF="003955_0027_10037C916E0A1260">
the Poor, yea she reached forth her Hand to the Needy. Her Husband</HI> while He lived <HI>Praised Her: and Her Children rise up and call her Blessed. Fa|vour is deceitful, and Beauty is vain: But a Wo|man that feareth the LORD, she shall be Praised. Give her</HI> Memory <HI>of the Fruit of her Hands, and let her own Works</HI> and Virtues <HI>Praise her in the Gates,</HI> as they do this Day.</P>
<P>In short, She Persever'd in her blameless &amp; ex|emplary Course to Death. And when she came to Dye&mdash; in the midst of all her earthly Delights and Prospects Resign'd Her self to the Divine Pleasure: In the midst of her distressing Agonies she shew'd an admirable Patience.&mdash;Express'd a lively Faith and Hope in the Almerciful &amp; Almighty SAVIOUR. &mdash;So fervently desir'd to be dissolved and to be with Him, that She told her Brother the <HI>Gover|nour</HI> when expressing His Hope of her Reviving and Returning to us (the Night before she Died) &mdash; <HI>No! Brother,</HI> said she, <HI>Not for a thousand Worlds!</HI> In the Flames of her most raging Fe|ver, she said, <HI>She was going to Heaven in a fiery Chariot.</HI> And thither no doubt She was soon transported.</P>
<P>Both her Life and Death were doubtless Pre|cious in the Sight of GOD, as they were emi|nently so with all who knew Her. And few have lived with higher Respect and Value, or deceased with deeper Regret and Sorrow.</P>
<P>Let her Memory be always Dear, her amiable Life remembred, and her Example followed by her Relatives and Others; and especially by those of the <HI>same Sex,</HI> to whom She was a distin|guish'd Ornament and Honour.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="003955_0028_10035CD8C14D2140">May her Prayers with those of her <HI>departed Consort,</HI> now rejoycing with each other in the Heavenly World, come down in multiplied and continual Blessings on their surviving and future Offspring. May the same Spirit dwell in them as dwelt in their happy Parents: that they may rise up in their Room and do as worthily as They; and at length may all meet in the Regions of eternal Light and rejoyce together.</P>
<P>And let us all Pray and Labour, that the Re|sidue of the HOLY SPIRIT may be poured out on us and our Posterity: that RELIGION in the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> may be revived and in the <HI>Purity</HI> maintained, <HI>as in our Fathers Days</HI>; and so continue flourishing till the Second Coming of the SON OF GOD, to take the Universal Kingdom of this lower World, and inherit all Nations.</P>

<HEAD>An ACCOUNT of the <HI>Deceased,</HI> From the <HI>Boston Gazette</HI> June 2. 1735.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WEDNESDAY</HI> Morning, <HI>May</HI> 21. Deceased Here, to the great Sorrow of the Town, after <HI>Twelve Days</HI> Illness of a violent Fever, that most desirable Gen|tlewoman Mrs. ELIZABETH OLIVER, Relict of the Honourable DANIEL OLIVER, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> She was the <HI>second</HI> Daughter of the Honourable ANDREW BELCHER, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> by his <HI>first</HI> Wife, Born at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> on <HI>Jan.</HI> 12. 1677, S. was mar|ried to Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI> in <HI>April</HI> 1696, became his Widow in <HI>July</HI> 1732, and was the eldest surviving Sister of our <HI>present</HI> GOVER|NOUR.</P>
<P>To her excellent good Sense and Wit and superior Education, she added all the Ornaments and Virtues of the Christian Life. She was admired for her rare Discretion, excellent OEconomy, ingenious and free Conversation, with such a Mixture of Mo|desty, Sincerity and Friendship, as rais'd the Pleasure, and en|gaged the Love of all about Her. She abounded in Pitty and Charity to those who wanted, was a faithful and beneficent Friend, discharged all the Offices of a Wife and Mother in such a Manner as to be an eminent Pattern to others. In her exalted Station she greatly honoured Religion, by despising the growing Vanities of the present Age, by a constant &amp; grave Atten|dance on all the Duties of Divine Worship, by countenancing the Ministers of it, and by a Regular Life. She bare her distres|sing Illness with wonderful Patience and Resignation, express'd her lively Hope in her SAVIOUR, and received the Approach of Death with great Serenity. Few have lived more esteemed, or died more lamented among us: And She was Honourably Interr'd the <HI>Saturday</HI> after.</P>
