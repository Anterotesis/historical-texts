<HEAD>A Narrative of the CAPTIVITY AND RESTAVRATION OF Mrs. Mary Rowlandson.</HEAD>
<P>_ON the tenth of <HI>February</HI> 1675. Came the <HI>Indians</HI> with great numbers upon <HI>Lancaster</HI>: Their first coming was about Sun-rising; hearing the noise of some Guns, we looked out; several Houses were burning, and the Smoke ascending to Hea|ven. There were five persons taken in one house, the Father, and the Mother and a sucking Child, they knockt on the head; the other two they took and carried away alive.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im but knockt him in head, and stript him naked, and split open his Bowels. Another seeing many of the <HI>Indians</HI> about his Barn, ventured and went out, but was quickly shot down. There were three others belonging to the same Garison who were killed; the <HI>Indians</HI> getting up upon the roof of the Barn, had advantage to shoot down upon them o|ver their Fortification. Thus these murtherous wretches went on, burning, and destroying before them,</P>
<P>At length they came and beset our own house, and quickly it was the dolefullest day that ever mine eyes saw. The House stood upon the edg of a hill; some of the <HI>Indians</HI> got behind the hill, o|thers into the Barn, and others behind any thing that could shelter them; from all which places they shot against the House, so that the Bullets seemed to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y like hail; and qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ckly they wounded one man among us, then another, and then a third, A|bout two hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s (according to my observation, in that amazing time) they had been about the house before they prevailed to fire it (which they did with Flax and Hemp, which they brought out of the Barn, and there being no defence about the House, only two Flankers at two opposite corners, and one of them not finished) they fired it once, and one ventured out and quenched it, but they quickly fired it again, and that took. Now is that dreadfull hour come, that I have often heard of (in time of War, as it was the case of others) but now mine eyes see it. Some in our house we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e fight|ing

We had six stout Dogs belonging to our Garrison, but none of them wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d stir, though another time, if any <HI>Indian</HI> had come to the door, they were ready to fly upon him and tear him down.

He was dressed in his Holland shirt, with great Laces sewed at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">il of it, he had his silver But|tons, his white Stockins, his Garters were hung round with Shillings, and he had Girdles of <HI>Wam|pom upon his head and shoulders.</HI> She had a Kersey Coat, and covered with Girdles of <HI>Wampom</HI> from the Loins upward: her armes from her elbows to her hands were covered with Bracelets; there were handfulls of Neck-laces about her neck, and seve|rall sorts of Jewels in her ears. She had fine red Stokins, and white Shoos, her hair powdered and face painted Red, that was alwayes before Black. And all the Dancers were after the same manner. There were two other singing and knocking on a Kettle for their musick.

is nearest: yea, at this time I could not rest, night nor day. The next night I was overjoyed, Mr. <HI>Hoar</HI> being come, and that with such good ti|dings. The third night <HI>I</HI> was even swallowed up with the thoughts of things, <HI>viz.</HI> that ever I should go home again; and that I must go, leaving my Children behind me in the <HI>Wilderness</HI>; so that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eep was now almost departed from mine eyes.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday morning</HI> they called their <HI>General</HI> Court (as they call it) to consult and dete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mine, whether I should go home or no: And they all as one man did seemingly consent to it, that I should go home; except <HI>Philip,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would not come among them.</P>
<P>But before <HI>I</HI> go any further, I would take leave to mention a few remarkable passages of provi|dence, which I took special notice of in my affli|cted time.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Of the fair opportunity lost in the long March, a little after the</HI> Fort-fight, <HI>when our</HI> English Army <HI>was so numerous, and in pursuit of the</HI> Enemy, <HI>and so near as to take several and destroy them and the</HI> Enemy <HI>in such distress for food, that our men might track them by their rooting in the earth for Ground-nuts, whilest they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ying for their lives.</HI> I say, that then our Army should want Provision, and be forc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to leave their pursuit and return homeward: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the very next week the <HI>Enemy</HI> come upon our <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n,</HI> like Bears bereft of their whelps, or so ma|ny <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avenous Wolves, rending us and our Lambs to
<PB N="60" REF="000332_0034_0FA4AD0ED48042B0">
death. But what shall I say? God seemed to leave his People to themselves, and order all things for his own holy ends. <HI>Shal there be evil in the City and the Lord hath not done it? They are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> grieved for the affliction of</HI> Joseph, <HI>therefore shal they go Cap|tive, with the first that go Captive.</HI> It is the Lords doing, and it should be marvelous in our eyes.</P>
<P N="2">2. I cannot but remember how the <HI>Indians</HI> de|rided the slowness, and dulness of the <HI>English</HI> Ar|my, in its setting out. For after the desolations at <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>Medfield,</HI> as <HI>I</HI> went along with them, they asked me when I thought the <HI>English</HI> Army would come after them? I told them I cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d not tell: It may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> will come in <HI>May,</HI> said they. Thus did they scoffe at us, as if the <HI>English</HI> would be a quarter of a year getting ready</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Which also I have hinted before, when the</HI> Eng|lish <HI>Army with new supplies were sent forth to pursue after the enemy, &amp; they understanding it: fled before them till they came to</HI> Baquaug <HI>River, where they forthwith went over safely: that that River should be impassable to the</HI> English. I can but admire to see the wonderfull providence of God in preserving the heathen for farther affliction to our poor Coun|trey. They could go in great numbers over, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the <HI>English</HI> must stop: God had an over-ruling hand in all those things.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It was thought, if their Corn were cut down, they would starve and dy with hunger: and all their Corn that could be found, was destroyed, and
<PB N="61" REF="000332_0034_0FA4AD0ED48042B0">
they driven from that little they had in store, into the Words in the midst of Winter</HI>; and yet how to ad|miration did the Lord preserve them for his ho|ly ends, and the destruction of many still amongst the <HI>English</HI>! strangely did the Lord provide for them; that I did not see (all the time I was a|mong them) one Man, Woman, or Child, die with hunger.</P>
<P>Though many times they would eat that, that a Hog or a Dog would hardly touch; yet by that God strengthned them to be a secu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge to his People.</P>
<P><HI>The chief and commonest food was Ground-nuts: They eat also Nuts and Acorns, Harty choaks, Lilly roots, Ground-beans,</HI> and several other weeds and roots, that I know no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P><HI>They would pick up old bones, and cut them to piec|es at the joynts, and if they were full of wormes and magots, they would scald them over the fire to make the vermine come out, and then boile them, and drink up the Liquor, and then beat the great ends of them in a Morter, and so eat them.</HI> They would eat Horses guts, and ears, and all sorts of wild Birds which they could catch: also Bear, Vennison, B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a|ver, Tortois, Frogs, Squirrels, Dogs, Skunks, Rattle-snakes; yea, the very Bark of Trees; be|sides all sorts of creatures, and provision which they plundered from the <HI>English. I</HI> can bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> stand in admiration to see the wonderful power of God, in providing for such a vast number of our Enemies
<PB N="62" REF="000332_0035_0FA4AD106DC19B98">
in the <HI>Wilderness,</HI> where there was nothing to be seen, but from hand to mouth. Many times in a morning, the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nerality of them, would eat up all they had, and yet have some further supply a|gainst they wanted. It is said, <HI>Psal.</HI> 81.13, 14. <HI>Oh, that my P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ople had hearkned to me, and</HI> Israel <HI>had walked in my wayes, I should soon have subdued their Enemies, and turned my hand against their Adversaries.</HI> But now our perverse and evil car|riages in the sight of the Lord, have so offended him, that instead of turning his hand against them, the Lord feeds &amp; nourishes them up to be a scourge to the whole Land.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Another thing that</HI> I <HI>would obs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rve is, the strange providence of God in turning things about when the</HI> Indians <HI>was at the highest, and the</HI> English <HI>at the low<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st</HI> I was with the Enemy eleven weeks and five dayes, and not one Week passed without the fury of the Enemy, and some desolation by fire and sword upon one place or other.

good turn, to send them to Heaven so soon.</HI> Again, they would say, <HI>This Summer that they would knock all the Rogues in the head, or drive them in|to the Sea, or make them flie the Countrey:</HI> think|ing surely, <HI>Agag-like, The bitterness of Death is past.</HI> Now the Heathen begins to think all is their own, &amp; the poor Christians hopes to sail (as to man) and now their eyes are more to God, and their hearts sigh heaven-ward: and to say in good ear|nest, <HI>Help Lord, or we perish:</HI> When the Lord had brought his people to this, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y saw no help in any thing but himself; then he takes the q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arrel into his own hand: and though they had made a pit, in their own imag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nations, as deep as hell for the Christians that Summer, yet the Lord hurll'd them selves into it. And the Lord had not so many wayes before to preserve them, but now he hath as many to destroy them.</P>
<P><HI>But to return again to my going home, where we may see a rema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kable change of Providence</HI>: At first they were all against it, except my Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">band would come for me; but afterwards they assented to it, and seemed much to rejoyce in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; some askt me to send them some Bread, others some Tobac|co, others shaking me by the hand, offering me a Hood and Scarfe to ride in; not one moving hand or tongue against it. Thus hath the Lord answer|ed my poor desire, and the many earnest requests of others put up unto God for me. In my travels an <HI>Indian</HI> came to me, and told me, if I were wil|ling,

he and his <HI>Squaw</HI> would run away, and go home along with me: I told him <HI>No</HI>: I was not willing to run away, but desired to wait Gods time, that I might go home quietly, and without fear. And now God hath granted me my desire. O the wonderfull power of God that <HI>I</HI> have seen, and the experience that I have had: I <HI>have been in the midst of those roaring Lyons, and Salvage Bears, that feared neither God, nor Man, nor the Devil, by night and day, alone and in company: sleeping all sorts together, and yet not one of them ever offered me the least abuse of unchastity to me, in word or action.</HI> Though some are ready to say, J speak it for my own credit; <HI>But I speak it in the presence of God, and to his Glory.</HI> Gods Power is as great now, and as sufficient to save, as when he preserved <HI>Daniel</HI> in the Lions Den; or the three <HI>Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dren</HI> in the fiery Furnace.

So I took my leave of them, and in coming along my heart melted in|to tears, more then all the while I was with them, and I was almost swallowed up with the thoughts that ever I should go home again.

And many more tender-hearted Friends we met with in that place.

and amongst the Heathen; thinking how it suf|fered with its wounds, and I was no way able to relieve it; and how it was buried by the Heathen in the <HI>Wilderness</HI> from among all Christians. We were hurried up and down in our thoughts, some|time we should hear a report that they were gone this way, and sometimes that; and that they were come in, in this place or that: We kept enquir|ing and listning to hear concerning them, but no certain news as yet. About this time the Coun|cil had ordered a day of publick <HI>Thanks-giving</HI>: though I thought I had still cause of mourning, and being unsettled in our minds, we thought we would ride toward the <HI>Eastward,</HI> to see if we could hear any thing concerning our Children. And as we were riding along [God is the wise disposer of all things] between <HI>Ipswich</HI> and <HI>Rowly</HI> we met with Mr. <HI>William Hubbard,</HI> who told us that our Son <HI>Ioseph</HI> was come in to Major <HI>Waldrens,</HI> and ano|ther with him, which was my Sisters Son.

<P><HI>I can remember the time, when</HI> I <HI>used to sleep qui|etly without workings in my thoughts, whole nights together, but now it is other wayes with me.</HI> When all are fast about me, and no eye open, but his who ever waketh, my thoughts are upon things past, upon the awfull dispensation of the Lord to|wards us; upon his wonderfull power and might, in carrying of us through so many difficulties, in returning us in safety, and suffering none to hurt us. I remember in the night season, how the o|ther day I was in the midst of thousands of ene|mies, &amp; nothing but death before me: It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> then hard work to perswade my self, that ever I should be satisfied with bread again, But now we are fed with the finest of the Wheat, and, as I may say, <HI>With honey out of the rook</HI>: In stead of the Husk, we have the fatted Calf: The thoughts of these things in the particulars of them, and of the love and goodness of God towards us, make it true of me, what <HI>David</HI> said of himself, <HI>Psal.</HI> 6.<HI>6.</HI> I <HI>wa|tered my Couch with my tears.</HI> Oh! the won|derfull power of God that mine eyes have seen, af|fording

matter enough for my thoughts to run in, that when others are sleeping mine eyes are weeping.</P>
<P>J <HI>have seen the extrem vanity of this World</HI>: One hour I have been in health, and wealth, wanting nothing: But the next hour in sickness and wounds, and death, having nothing but sorrow and affliction.</P>
<P><HI>Before</HI> I <HI>knew what affliction meant,</HI> I <HI>was rea|dy sometimes to wish for it.</HI> When I lived in pros|perity; having the comforts of the World about me, my relations by me, my Heart chearfull: and taking little care for any thing; and yet seeing many, whom <HI>I</HI> preferred before my self, under ma|ny tryals and afflictions, in sickness, weakness, poverty, losses, crosses, and cares of the World, I should be sometimes jealous least I should have my portion in this life, and that Scripture would come to my mind, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.6. <HI>For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every Son whom he receiveth.</HI> But now I see the Lord had his time to scourge and chasten me. The portion of some is to have their afflictions by drops, now one drop and then another; but the dregs of the Cup, the Wine of astonishment: like a sweeping rain that leaveth no food, did the Lord prepare to be my po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ion Affliction I wanted, and affliction I had, full measure (I thought) pressed down and running over: yet I see, when God calls a Per|son to any thing, and through never so many dif|culties,

And I hope I can say in some measure, As <HI>David</HI> did, <HI>It is good for me that I have been af|flicted.</HI> The Lord hath shewed me the vanity of these outward things. That they are the <HI>Vanity of vanities, and vexation of spirit</HI>; that they are but a shadow, a blast, a bubble, and things of no continuance. That we must rely on God himself, and our whole dependance must be upon him. If trouble from smallar matters begin to arise in me, I have something at hand to check my self with, and say, why am I troubled? It was but the other day that if <HI>I</HI> had had the world, I would have given it for my freedom, or to have been a Servant to a Christian. I have learned to look beyond present and smaller troubles, and to be quieted under them, as <HI>Moses</HI> said, <HI>Exod.</HI> 14.13. <HI>Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord.</HI></P>
