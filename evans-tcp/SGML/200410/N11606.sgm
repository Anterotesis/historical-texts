<L>Salt tears of grief by many a parent shed,</L>

<L>Say noble PUTNAM, shall we hear of this,</L>

<L>Not less bold WARREN have I felt the pangs</L>
<L>Of woe severe in this calamity:</L>
<L>And could I with my life redeem the times,</L>
<L>The richest blood that circles round my heart,</L>

<L>When nature's self, and all the strength of art,</L>
<L>Opposes every effort in our power?</L>
<L>These Tons of slavery dare not advance,</L>
<L>And meet in equal fight our hostile arms.</L>
<L>For yet they well remember LEXINGTON,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="014668_0010_0F948CB9F93B7958">
And what they suffer'd on that rueful day,</L>
<L>When wantoning in savage rage, they march'd</L>
<L>Onward to CONCORD, in a firm array,</L>
<L>Mock music playing, and the ample flag</L>
<L>Of tyranny display'd; but with dire loss</L>
<L>And infamy drove back, they gain'd the town,</L>
<L>And under cover of their ships of war,</L>
<L>Retir'd, confounded and dismay'd. No more</L>

<L>Who to oppose dire arbitrary sway,</L>

<L>The free born spirit of immortal fire</L>
<L>Is stranger to ignoble deeds, and shuns</L>
<L>The name of cowardice. But well thy mind,</L>
<L>Sage, and matur'd by long experience, weighs</L>
<L>The perilous attempt, to storm the town,</L>
<L>And rescue thence, the suff'ring citizens.</L>
<L>For but one pass to that peninsula,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="014668_0011_0F948CBAB8F50A18">
On which the city stands, on all sides barr'd.</L>

<L>Of the all devouring, deep mouth'd cannon, plac'd,</L>
<L>On many a strong redoubt; While on each side,</L>
<L>The ships of war, moor'd, in the winding bay,</L>
<L>Can sweep ten thousand from the level beach,</L>
<L>"And render all access impregnable."</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>WARREN.</SPEAKER>
<L>True valiant GARD'NER, the attempt is vain,</L>
<L>To force that entrance to the sea-girt town;</L>
<L>Which while we hop'd for peace, and in that view,</L>
<L>Kept back our swords, we saw them fortify.</L>
<L>But what if haply, with a chosen few,</L>
<L>Led through the midnight shades, yon heights were gain'd,</L>
<L>And that contiguous hill, whose grassy foot,</L>
<L>By Mystick's gentle tide is wash'd. Here rais'd,</L>
<L>Strong batt'ries jutting o'er the level sea,</L>
<L>With everlasting thunder, shall annoy</L>
<L>Their navy far beneath; and in some lucky hour,</L>
<L>When dubious darkness on the land is spread,</L>
<L>A chosen band may pierce their sep'rate fleet,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="014668_0012_0F948CBBB6DA7EE8">
And in swift boats, across the narrow tide,</L>
<L>Pour like a flame, on their unguarded ranks,</L>
<L>And wither them: As when an Angel smote,</L>
<L>The Assyrian camp. The proud Sennacherib,</L>
<L>With impious rage, against the hill of God,</L>
<L>Blasphem'd. Low humbl'd, when the dawning light,</L>
<L>Saw all his host dead men: So yet I trust,</L>
<L>The God of battles, will avouch our cause,</L>
<L>And those proud champions of despotic power,</L>
<L>Who turn our fasting to their mirth, and mock</L>
<L>Our prayers, naming us the SAINTS, shall yet,</L>

<L>E're yet the morn, with dawning light breaks forth,</L>

<L>The thought is perilous, and many men,</L>

<L>In woody vallies, or on mountain tops,</L>
<L>To mix with wolves and kindred savages.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GAGE.</SPEAKER>
<L>This mighty paradox, will soon dissolve.</L>
<L>Hear first, BURGOYNE, the valour of these men,</L>
<L>Fir'd with the zeal, of fiercest liberty,</L>
<L>No fear of death, so terrible to all,</L>
<L>Can stop their rage. Grey-headed clergymen,</L>
<L>With holy bible, and continual prayer,</L>
<L>Bear up their fortitude&mdash;and talk of heav'n,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="014668_0015_0F948CC0C7028E40">
And tell them, that sweet soul, who dies in battle,</L>
<L>Shall walk, with spirits of the just. These words,</L>
<L>Add wings to native rage, and hurry them</L>
<L>Impetuous to war. Nor yet in arms</L>
<L>Unpractised. The day of LEXINGTON,</L>
<L>A sad conviction gave our soldiery,</L>
<L>That these AMERICANS, were not that herd,</L>
<L>And rout ungovern'd, which we painted them.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HOWE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not strange to your maturer thought, BURGOYNE,</L>
<L>This matter will appear. A people brave,</L>
<L>Who never yet, of luxury, or soft</L>
<L>Delights, effeminate, and false, have tasted.</L>
<L>But, through hate of chains, and slav'ry, suppos'd,</L>
<L>Forsake their mountain tops, and rush to arms.</L>
<L>Oft have I heard their valour, published:</L>
<L>Their perseverance, and untameable</L>
<L>Fierce mind, when late they fought with us, and drove,</L>
<L>The French encroaching on their settlements,</L>
<L>Back to their frozen lakes. Or when with us</L>
<L>On Cape B<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ton, they stormed Louisburg.</L>
<L>With us in Canada, they took Quebec;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="014668_0016_0F948CC175CA66A8">
And at the Havannah, these NEW-ENGLAND MEN,</L>
<L>Led on by PUTNAM, acted gallantly.</L>
<L>I had a brother once, who in that war,</L>
<L>With fame commanded them, and when he fell,</L>
<L>Not unlamented; for these warriors,</L>
<L>So brave themselves, and sensible of merit,</L>
<L>Erected him a costly monument;</L>
<L>And much it grieves me that I draw my sword,</L>
<L>For this late insurrection, and revolt,</L>
<L>To chastise them. Would to Almighty God,</L>
<L>The task unnatural, had been assign'd,</L>
<L>Else where. But since by Heaven, determined,</L>
<L>Let's on, and wipe the day of LEXINGTON,</L>
<L>Thus soil'd, quite from our soldiers memories.</L>
<L>This reinforcement, which with us have sail'd,</L>
<L>In many a transport, from BRITANNIA'S shores,</L>
<L>Will give new vigour to the Royal Arms,</L>
<L>And crush rebellion, in its infancy.</L>
<L>Let's on, and from this siege, calamitous,</L>
<L>Assert our liberty; nay rather die,</L>
<L>Transfix'd in battle, by their bayonets,</L>
<L>Than thus remain, the scoff, and ridicule</L>
<L>Of gibing wits, and paultry gazetteers,</L>

<L>From full experience, boldly prompts you on,</L>
<L>I give my voice, and when one day hath pass'd,</L>
<L>In whose swift hours, may be wrought, highly up,</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Written by a GENTLEMAN of the ARMY.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Supposed to be spoken, immediately after the Battle; By Lieutenant Colonel WEBB, Aid de camp to General PUTNAM.</STAGE>
<L>THE Field is their's, but dearly was it bought,</L>
<L>Thus long defended and severely fought.</L>
<L>Now pale-fac'd death sits brooding o'er the strand,</L>
<L>And views the carnage of his ruthless hand.</L>
<L>But why my heart this deep unbidden sigh,</L>
<L>Why steals the tear, soft trickling from the eye?</L>
<L>Is FREEDOM master'd by our late defeat</L>
<L>Or HONOUR wounded by a brave retreat?</L>
<L>'Tis nature dictates; and in pride's despite,</L>
<L>I mourn my brethren slaughter'd in the fight.</L>
<L>'Th' insulting foe, now revels o'er the ground,</L>
<L>Yet flush'd with victory, they feel the wound.</L>
<L>Embru'd in gore, they bleed from ev'ry part,</L>
<L>And deep wounds rankle at BRITANNIA'S heart.</L>
<L>O fatal conquest! Speak thou crimson'd plain,</L>
<L>Now press'd beneath the weight of hundreds slain?</L>
<L>There heaps of BRITISH youth promiscuous lie,</L>
<L>Here, murder'd FREEMEN catch the wand'ring eye.</L>
<L>Observe yon stripling bath'd in purple gore,</L>
<L>He bleeds for FREEDOM on his native shore.</L>
<L><PB REF="014668_0043_0F948CDC0FC21690">
His livid eyes in drear convulsions roll,</L>
<L>While from his wounds escapes the flutt'ring soul,</L>
<L>Breathless and naked on th' ensanguin'd plain,</L>
<L>Midst friends and brothers, sons and fathers slain.</L>
<L>No pitying hand his languid eyes to close,</L>
<L>He breathes his last amidst insulting foes;</L>
<L>His body plunder'd, massacred, abus'd;</L>
<L>By Christians&mdash;Christian fun'ral rites refus'd&mdash;</L>
<L>Thrown as a carrion in the public way,</L>
<L>To <HI>Dogs,</HI> to <HI>Britons,</HI> and to <HI>Birds</HI> a prey.</L>
<L>Enwrapt in sulph'rous flame and clouds of smoke,</L>
<L>Brave GARD'NER sinks beneath the deadly stroke,</L>
<L>And WARREN bleeds to grace the bloody strife</L>
<L>And for his injur'd country gives his life.</L>
<L>Yet while his mighty soul ascends the skies,</L>
<L>On earth his blood for ten-fold vengeance cries.</L>
<L>Great spirit rest&mdash;by Heaven it is decreed,</L>
<L>Thy murd'ring tyrante by the sword shall bleed.</L>
<L>E'en racks and gibbets would but consecrate,</L>
<L>And death repeated be too kind a fate.</L>
<L>The sword is drawn, in peace no more to rest,</L>
<L>Till justice bathes it in some tyrants breast.</L>
<L>Honour my weapon with the glorious task,</L>
<L>And let me stab, 'tis all the boon I ask.</L>
<L>Kind pow'rs, beneath your all-protecting shield,</L>
<L>I now unsheath my sword, and take the field,</L>
<L>Sure of success, with this sweet comfort giv'n,</L>
<L>Who fights for FREEDOM,&mdash;fights the cause of HEAV'N.</L>
