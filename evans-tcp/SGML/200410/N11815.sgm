<OPENER>To the Tune of the British GRENADIERS.</OPENER>
<LG>
<L>VAIN BRITONS, boast no longer with proud Indignity,</L>
<L>By Land&mdash;your conqu'ring Legions&mdash;your matchless Strength at Sea!</L>
<L>Since WE your braver Sons, incens'd, our Swords have girded on,</L>
<L>Huzza, Huzza, Huzza, Huzza, for WAR and WA<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">HINGTON!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Urg'd on by <HI>North</HI> and Vengeance, these valiant Champions came,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">ud bellowing TEA and TREASON! and GEORGE was all on Flame!</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">t sacrilegious as it seems&mdash;we REBELS still live on&mdash;</L>
<L>And laugh at all your empty Puffs, and so does WASHINGTON!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still deaf to mild Intreaties&mdash;still blind to England's Good,</L>
<L>You have for Thirty Pieces&mdash;betray'd your Country's Blood;</L>
<L>Like Aesop's greedy Cur, you'll gain a Shadow for your Bone,</L>
<L>Yet find us fearful Shades indeed, inspir'd by WASHINGTON.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mysterious! unexampled! incomprehensible!</L>
<L>The blundering Schemes of Britain, their Folly, Pride and Zeal!</L>
<L>Like <HI>Lions</HI> how ye growl, and threat! meer <HI>Asses</HI> have ye shown,</L>
<L>And ye shall share an <HI>Ass's</HI> Fate, and drudge for WASHINGTON!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Your dark, unfathom'd Councils&mdash;our weakest Heads defeat,</L>
<L>Our Children rout your Armies&mdash;our Boats destroy your Fleet!</L>
<L>And to compleat the dire Disgrace, coop'd up within a Town,</L>
<L>You live the Scorn of all our Host! the Slaves of WASHINGTON!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great Heav'n! is this the Nation&mdash;whose thund'ring Arms were hurl'd</L>
<L>Thro' Europe, Afric, India? whose Navy rul'd a World?</L>
<L>The Lustre of your former Deeds&mdash;whole Ages of Renown&mdash;</L>
<L>Lost! in a Moment&mdash;or transfer'd to US and WASHINGTON.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet think not Thirst of Glory&mdash;unsheaths our vengeful Swords&mdash;</L>
<L>To rend your Bands asunder&mdash;and cast away your Cords&mdash;</L>
<L>'Tis Heav'n-born FREEDOM fires us all&mdash;and strengthens each brave Son&mdash;</L>
<L>From him who humbly guides the Plough to god-like WASHINGTON!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For THIS&mdash;O could our Wishes&mdash;your ancient Rage inspire!</L>
<L>Your Armies should be doubled&mdash;in Numbers, Force and Fire!</L>
<L>Then might the glorious Conflict prove, which best deserv'd the Boon&mdash;</L>
<L>AMERICA or ALBION&mdash;a GEORGE or WASHINGTON!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fir'd with the great Idea&mdash;our Fathers' Shades would rise!</L>
<L>To view the stern Contention&mdash;the Gods desert their Skies&mdash;</L>
<L>And Wolfe, mid Hosts of Heroes, superior, bending down&mdash;</L>
<L>Cry out, with eager Transport&mdash;Well done, brave WASHINGTON!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should GEORGE, too choice of <HI>Britons</HI>&mdash;to foreign Realms apply&mdash;</L>
<L>And madly arm half Europe&mdash;yet still we would defy</L>
<L>Turk, Russian, Jew, and Infidel, or all those Pow'rs in one&mdash;</L>
<L>While HANCOCK crowns our Senate&mdash;our Camp great WASHINGTON.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' warlike Weapons fail'd us&mdash;disdaining slavish Fears&mdash;</L>
<L>To Swords we'd beat our Plough-shares&mdash;our Pruning hooks to Spears&mdash;</L>
<L>And rush all-desp'rate! on our Foe! nor breathe, till Battle won;</L>
<L>Then shout and shout, AMERICA! and conqu'ring WASHINGTON!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Proud France should view with Terror&mdash;and haughty Spain should fear&mdash;</L>
<L>While ev'ry warlike Nation&mdash; would court Alliance here&mdash;</L>
<L>And George, his Minions trembling round, dismounted from his Throne&mdash;</L>
<L>Pay Homage to AMERICA and glorious WASHINGTGN!</L>
