<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Subsequent Discourses, I have Studied all possible Plainness and Perspicuity: My design therein be|ing to Profit Ordinary <HI>Readers</HI>; yea, the Meanest Capacities. I have not therefore (altho' I incline to the Negative) Concerned my self with the <HI>Disputes</HI> about that <HI>Abstruse Question,</HI> Whether the Saints in Glory shall have <HI>a Perfect Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>First Being.</HI> Or (which is the same Question.) <HI>See the Divine Essence it self?</HI> That Great Scho|lar and Blessed Martyr, <HI>Peter Ramus</HI> said truly, <HI>He must have Gods own Logick, who is able to give a Perfect Definition of God.</HI> But a man may Perfectly Define that whose Essence he can see and know.

<P>It was a good Expression of a Pious man, who Dy'd not long since; <HI>I would not</HI> (said he) <HI>part with the Hopes I have by Christ of Heaven, for Ten Thousand Worlds.</HI> The Awful Providences of GOD call upon us to get Hearts Wean|ed from <HI>this World,</HI> and to make sure of <HI>Treasure in Heaven.</HI> These SERMONS were <HI>Pluckt out of the Burning</HI>; when Seven Book-sellers Shops in <HI>Boston</HI> were Consumed in those Flames, which on the

<P>It has been Observed, That when God inclines the Hearts of any of His Ser|vants to dwell much in their <HI>Meditati|ons</HI> on <HI>Another World,</HI> it is a Sign that they have not Long to be in <HI>This World.</HI> Mr. <HI>Bolton</HI> Dy'd Preaching on the <HI>Hap|piness of Heaven.</HI> Our Famous Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> (who was in his Time <HI>the Glory of Cam|bridge</HI>) his <HI>Last Lecture-Sermons</HI> were on <HI>the Eternal Glory of Believers,</HI> after this Life. Those Excellent and Hea|venly Discourses have been Printed at <HI>London,</HI> and I wish they were <HI>Reprinted</HI> in <HI>Boston</HI>; where many much Inferiour to them have been so.</P>
<P>If there is any thing in the mentioned Observation (or whether there is or no,) it may be hoped that the Time of my Departure from this Earth is near at

hand. It must needs be so; because I have been an Unprofitable Servant there|in, upwards of Seventy and Two Years; and more than Fifty are Expired, since I began my Publick Ministry in <HI>Boston.</HI> Would Christians Think much of the Vanity of all things on the Earth; and on the <HI>Soul-satisfaction</HI> which is to be had in <HI>Beholding the Glory of</HI> JESUS CHRIST in the Heavenly World, surely they would Long to be there.</P>
<P>It is Reported concerning <HI>Sylvanus</HI> (a Minister at <HI>Nazareth</HI>) that when <HI>Hierom</HI> Enquired of him, what he did most of all desire that GOD would do for him; his Answer was, <HI>That it would Please Him to Dismiss me out of this Evil World.</HI> And another Religious Person (<HI>Columbanus</HI>) importuned a special Friend of his, who Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nestly Prayed for the Continuance of his Life; that he would not make that Prayer in his behalf. Such were the Longings of his Soul to be in the <HI>Heaven|ly Countrey.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="039533_0004_10142B422B87D068">I must acknowledge, that the Prayers of the Lord's People, in the Dear Flock to which I am Related, and of many Others, have been the Means of Lengthning my Days for so long a Time.

Neverthe|less for the future, Let me intreat them to Pray, not for my Longer abiding here; but that whilest I am in the World, I may be Serviceable; and that I might be made <HI>Meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light</HI>; and that the Lord will graciously Hasten my being among, <HI>the Spirits of Just Men made Perfect.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THese words are part of the A|postle's Prayer for the <HI>Saints</HI> of God in the Church of the <HI>Ephesians</HI>: In which we have first the Object of the Prayer. The Blessed GOD is the only Object of Prayer; who is in the preceding
<PB N="2" REF="039533_0006_10142B46596C6858">
Verse styled, <HI>The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Father of Glory.</HI> He is the God of Christ in respect of Christ's Medi|atory Office; and of the New Covenant of which he is the Head. In the Old Testa|ment, God is frequently called the <HI>God of Abraham, &amp; of Isaac, &amp; of Jacob</HI>; because of his Covenant with them: But in the New Testament, He is Named <HI>the God of Jesus Christ</HI>; who is the Mediator of the New Covenant. He is said to be <HI>given for a Covenant of the People.</HI> And God is styled <HI>the Father of Glory</HI>; for that he is the most Glorious Father, and the Author of all Glory, &amp; he to whom all Glory is due Secondly, We have the Matter of the Prayer; or the thing which the Apostle prays for, in the behalf of these <HI>Saints.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) That God would <HI>give them the Spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him.</HI> That Wisdom and Knowledge wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> already given to them; but he prays tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they might have more of it. No Saints o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Earth have so much wisdom, but they nee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>That the eyes of their understandin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="3" REF="039533_0006_10142B46596C6858">
might be Enlightned.</HI> What the eye is to the Body, the understanding is to the Soul. He prays that they might have greater measures of Divine Illumination: That they might with the eye of their Souls see further into heavenly Mysteries.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>That they might know what is the Hope of his Calling.</HI> God causeth Belie|vers on Christ to hope for the glory of heaven: And they have sufficient ground for that hope. The Apostle prays that they might <HI>know this.</HI> And this prayer fitly follows upon the former particular; For notwithstanding they have infinite grounds to believe that the glory of hea|ven shall be their Portion, they cannot <HI>know</HI> that they have so, except God shall <HI>Enlighten</HI> their minds.</P>
<P N="4">(4) That they might know how great that Glory is which they are called to hope for. The Apostle prays not only that they might have assurance of their right and title to an Inheritance reserved in heaven for them; but that it is a rich &amp; glorious Inheritance; which are the words before us to insist on.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="039533_0007_10142B48C3754100">I shall Endeavour to give you the Meaning of them, in speaking to the DOCTRINE to be insisted on; which is,
<Q>That the Happiness of the Saints of God in the Heavenly World, will be wonderfully Great and Glorious.</Q></P>
<P>Some <HI>Propositions</HI> for Opening &amp; Con|firming the Truth, may be set before us.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The Saints of God shall enjoy Happiness in Heaven.</HI> The Inheritance which the Text speaks of, belongs to <HI>his Saints.</HI> And it is an&punc; heavenly Inheritance; an Inheri|tance not to be enjoyed on earth, but in heaven.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is and ever has been an holy pur|pose in the heart of God to have his Saints with him in heaven</HI>; there to enjoy happi|ness. What ever God has purposed, shall infallibly be accomplished: His Decrees are unalterable: Job 23.13. <HI>He is of one mind, &amp; who can turn him?</HI> Men oft times pur|pose, and change their minds upon second thoughts: They are subject to mistakes
<PB N="5" REF="039533_0007_10142B48C3754100">
and do not see at first so far <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s afterwards. But it is not so with <HI>God only wise.</HI> Psal. 33.11. <HI>The counsel of the Lord stands for ever; the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</HI> Now there has been from eternity a gra|cious purpose in the heart of God, con|cerning the salvation of his Saints; and their being made partakers of the heaven|ly Inheritance: 2 Tim. 1.9. <HI>Who has saved us according to his own purpose &amp; grace,</HI> i. e. his gracious purpose, <HI>which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.</HI> He has <HI>Predestinated</HI> them thereunto: Rom. 8.30. <HI>Whom he did Predestinate, them he Called; whom he Called, them he Justified; whom he Justified, them he Glorified</HI> Heaven and Happiness was designed for them at the Foundation of the world. When God Created the world, the first thing that he made, was an heaven for his Saints to dwell with him there to Eternity. <HI>In the begin|ning God made heaven</HI>; that heaven which is the Saints Inheritance. Therefore it will be said to them at the last day, <HI>Come you blessed, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the world</HI> Mat. 25.34.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="039533_0008_10142B4A682F71F0">2. <HI>God has promised this Inheritance to his Saints.</HI> He has not only purposed to give it, but has made known his <HI>Purpose</HI> by his <HI>Promise.</HI> They are <HI>heirs of the King|dom, which he has promised to them that love him,</HI> Jam. 2.5. Wherefore <HI>Heaven</HI> is called <HI>the Promise</HI>: Heb. 10.36. <HI>That you may inherit the Promise.</HI> They that in|herit Heaven, inherit the Promise. God promised <HI>Adam</HI> an happy life in Paradise, in case of his continuing in his Obedience. But he has promised that which is better than an earthly life in Paradise to the true Believer, <HI>viz.</HI> Eternal Life in heaven: 1 Joh. 2.25. <HI>And this is the promise that he has promised, even Eternal Life.</HI> The Cove|nant of Grace is better than the Covenant of Works: It is a better Covenant; esta|blished upon better Promises. Hence the Promises of the Covenant are said to be <HI>exceeding great &amp; precious,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.4. An Inheritance in heaven is an exceeding great thing; Eternal Life there, is a preci|ous thing. Now what ever God has pro|mised, will surely be performed. He is a faithful Covenant-keeping God; nor ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="7" REF="039533_0008_10142B4A682F71F0">
he be otherwise. All that he promised to <HI>David,</HI> he performed. This <HI>Solomon</HI> ac|knowledged in the Prayer which he made at the Dedication of the Temple; 1 King. 8.23, 24. <HI>Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee; who keepest Covenant &amp; Mercy with thy Servants that walk before thee with all their heart; who hast kept with thy Ser|vant</HI> David <HI>my Father that thou promisedst him; thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand.</HI> And all that God promised concerning the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> he made good: Ver. 56. <HI>Blessed be the Lord, that has given rest to his People</HI> Israel, <HI>ac|cording to all that he promised; there has not failed one word of all his good promise.</HI> We may then be assured, that whereas God has promised to give his Saints an everlasting Rest in the heavenly <HI>Canaan,</HI> he will not fail to do it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Jesus Christ has purchased this Inhe|ritance</HI> for his Saints They have a right unto it, not only by vertue of a <HI>Promise</HI>; but of a blessed <HI>Purchase.</HI> It is a <HI>Purchased Possession,</HI> Eph. 1.14&punc; Christ has bought his People with a valuable price: 1 Cor. 7.23.
<PB N="8" REF="039533_0009_10142B4FBB7027F0">
<HI>You are bought with a Price.</HI> And when he bought them, he bought heaven for them too. The heavenly Inheritance is infinitely more Valuable than any earthly Inheritance; nevertheless, Christ has given as much for the purchasing of it as it is worth; Namely, his own precious Life &amp; Blood. Believers are bought, &amp; Heaven is bought for them; <HI>not with silver &amp; gold, but with the precious Blood of Jesus Christ,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.19. Silver and Gold will purchase an Earthly Inheritance; but the Heavenly Inheritance is infinitely more Valuable than all the Silver and Gold in the world: But the precious Blood of Christ is of Va|lue sufficient to Purchase it. No meer Man or Creature, did ever Merit any thing at the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nds of God; much less so great a Good as the Glory of heaven: But Christ has done it with the price of his infinite|ly Meritorious Blood. Believers may from the consideration of the infinite Me|rit of that Blood, have an humble holy Confidence, of their entring into heaven: Heb. 10.19. <HI>Having boldness to enter into the Holiest by the Blood of Jesus.</HI> It is not
<PB N="9" REF="039533_0009_10142B4FBB7027F0">
to be imagined, that Christ has Died in Vain. The Apostle says, <HI>If Righteousness came by the Law, then Christ is Dead in Vain,</HI> Gal. 1.21. So if Believers should not ob|tain the heavenly Inheritance, then Christ has Died and shed his precious Blood in Vain.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Heaven is come down into the Souls of those who are indeed Saints of God.</HI> Where there is real Sanctity, heaven is come into the Soul: Heb. 3.1. <HI>Holy Brethren, parta|kers of the Heavenly Calling.</HI> Men are apt to think, that the happiness of heaven does consist in a perfect freedom from all affli|ctive Evils, and in blessed Delights; and so it does in part, but <HI>more in Holiness.</HI> Per|fection in holiness is the glory of heaven. Tis said, <HI>We are Chosen that we should be Holy,</HI> Eph. 1.4. We are Chosen that we should be happy; to be holy is to be happy. A sanctified man has an <HI>Heaven-born soul</HI>: He is born <HI>from above</HI>; that is from <HI>Heaven.</HI> True saving Grace is eter|nal Life and Glory in the beginnings of it. It is called <HI>the first fruits,</HI> Rom. 8.23. The first fruits were but an handful; yet a
<PB N="10" REF="039533_0010_10142B515FD70FE0">
pledge of a plentiful crop. So is Grace in the soul, of an harvest of Glory. Hence also, Grace is called <HI>the Earnest of the In|heritance,</HI> Eph. 1.14. When men are pur|chasing an Inheritance, if they give an <HI>Ear|nest Peny,</HI> that assures the Inheritance to them. Thus when the holy Spirit begins a work of Grace in the soul of the Believer, that assures him, that the heavenly Inhe|ritance shall be given to him.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The Saints of God are his Adopted Chil|dren.</HI> A Saint and a true Believer on Christ are the same. That glorious Pri|viledge of Divine Adoption does belong to all true Believers. They may lawfully think and say, that they are the Children of God: Joh. 1.12. <HI>But to as many as re|ceived him, to them gave he Power,</HI> that is Right or Priviledge, <HI>to become the Sons of God; even to them that believe on his Name.</HI> They have in them the spirit of Adopted Children, Crying to God, <HI>Abba Father</HI>&punc; as Children will Cry, <HI>Father! Father!</HI> whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they need any thing. Now if God ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Adopted them, he will certainly bestow <HI>His</HI> Inheritance upon them. Natura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="11" REF="039533_0010_10142B515FD70FE0">
Children are not always <HI>Heirs</HI>; but A|dopted Children are. Believers if they are (as they are) God's Adopted <HI>Chil|dren, then Heirs; Heirs of God, and Joynt-Heirs with Christ,</HI> Rom. 8.17.</P>
<P N="6">6 <HI>If it were not for this Heavenly Inheri|tance, Believers would be the most Misera|ble men in the world.</HI> 1 Cor. 15.19. <HI>If in this Life only we have Hope in Christ, we are of all men the most miserable.</HI> For often it is so; that Ungodly men Prosper in the world: They have a brave time of it here; Riches, and Honours, and Earthly hap|piness, more than heart could wish. When at the same time, the Saints and Servants of God are Exposed to all manner of Mi|series; and this it may be too for their Godliness. <HI>For thy sake we are Killed all the Day long!</HI> Therefore we may be assured that they shall be Happy in another world for ever; and that will more than compen|sate for all their Afflictions in this world. We may from such Providences conclude, that most certainly that there is both an Heaven and an Hell. Since Wicked men have their <HI>Good things in their Life time</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="039533_0011_10142B5450624E30">
here, we may be assured that there is a Life to come in which they shall receive Evil. It was well replied by a Christian Emperor, when some informed him that an Old Noble man above Ninety Years was newly Dead; and that he had been one of the Wickedest men that ever lived, and yet never met with any considerable Affliction throughout the whole course of his Life; then (said the Emperor) we may conclude that Divines tell us the Truth, when they say that there is ano|ther World besides this wherein we now Live. Wicked <HI>Dives</HI> Lived at heart-ease, faring Deliciously every day; but when Dead, and his Soul gone into Eternity, he Cries out, <HI>I am in a place of Torment.</HI> So when we see Holy men, and it may be such as have done great Service for God, under sore Afflictions and Temptations, we may rest satisfied, that there is an Heaven in which they shall be Comforted. It is a|gainst the Light of Natural Reason, to imagine that Vertuous and Godly men shall be more Miserable than the Wicked|edst of men. Yet so it must be, if there
<PB N="13" REF="039533_0011_10142B5450624E30">
is not an Heavenly Inheritance reserved for them.</P>

<P><HI>The Happiness of Saints in the Heavenly World, will be wonderfully Great.</HI></P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Holy Scriptures do abundantly declare it to be so: 2 Cor. 4.17. <HI>A far more Exceeding Glory.</HI> There is a difficulty in translating the Apostle's words, so as to give them a due <HI>Emphasis</HI>: One translates them, <HI>Mire supra modum,</HI> A Glory which is wonderfully above measure. Another renders them, <HI>Excellently Excelling Glory: Kath, hyperbolen eis hyperbolen.</HI> An <HI>Hyper|bolical</HI> Glory, &amp; more than so. No Hyper|bole of Expression can be beyond what this Glory really is. Add one <HI>Hyperbole</HI> to a|nother, and all will come short of what the Happiness really is. It was <HI>Luthers</HI> say|ing, that <HI>Christ &amp; Heaven admit of no Hy|perbole.</HI> We can not over speak in set|ting forth the Excellency of Christ, or the Glory of Heaven: It is <HI>Ineffable.</HI> When the Apostle was Miraculously caught up to Paradise, he saw a Glory that is Unut|terable.
<PB N="14" REF="039533_0012_10142B56E4EF5280">
The happiness of Saints in hea|ven is beyond all Conception; therefore beyond all Expression. <HI>Eye has not seen, nor Ear heard; neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath pre|pared for them that Love him,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.9. The Eye can see glorious things: Men may hear of more glorious things than they can see: The heart may think of more than the ear can hear. But the Hap|piness of Heaven is beyond all Imaginati|on. <HI>David</HI> when inspired by the Spirit of God, could not but admire this happiness: Psal. 31.19 <HI>O! How great is thy Goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that Fear thee?</HI> O how great! Tis wonderfully great. There is a mighty Treasure of Goodness, &amp; so of Glory <HI>Laid up</HI> for them. And where is it <HI>Laid up</HI>? It is in Heaven. <HI>Saints</HI> themselves will wonder and be a|mazed at their own happiness in the Fu|ture state; especially at the glory and hap|piness which after the Resurrection they shall be the Subjects of, (as hereafter w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> shall shew:) Notwithstanding their Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had been in heaven for some time, &amp; ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="15" REF="039533_0012_10142B56E4EF5280">
wonderfully happy, yet to see such an Ad|dition to their happiness at the <HI>Last Day,</HI> it will make them wonder &amp; admire, and glorify Christ, from whom proceeds all their Glory: 2 Thes. 1.10. When <HI>He shall come to be glorified in His Saints, &amp; to be admired in all them that Believe in that Day.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The things whereunto this Happi|ness is resembled in the Scripture, declares it to be wonderfully great. If it should be set before us in the proper <HI>Dialect of Heaven,</HI> whilest we remain in this Mortal state, we should understand nothing of it. Christ said to <HI>Nicodemus</HI>; Joh. 3.12. <HI>If I have told you Earthly things, &amp; you believe not: How shall you believe, if I tell you of Heavenly things?</HI> Christ did by Earthly Similitudes &amp; Parables, set forth Heaven|ly Mysteries Should he have spoken of Heavenly Glories, in a <HI>Style</HI> suitable to the Nature of them; mortal men could not have Comprehended it.

There are Three Expressions in the Text before us, by which the Happiness of Saints in the Heavenly World is denoted.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) It is compared to an <HI>Inheritance:</HI> If a man has a great Inheritance fallen to him, he is counted an happy man: There|fore is Heaven resembled to an Inheri|tance: 1 Pet. 1.4. <HI>An Inheritance reserved in heaven for them.</HI> The Joys of heaven are called, the Inheritance of the Saints in Light, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.12. When Heaven is com|pared to an Inheritance, it is in allusion to the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> which was divided by Lot to the Children of Israel; and gi|ven to them for an Inheritance. <HI>Moses</HI> said to them, <HI>Ye are not come to the Rest &amp; to the Inheritance which the Lord your God giveth you, but when you go over Jordan, &amp; dwell in the Land which the Lord your God giveth you to Inherit,</HI> &amp;c Deut. 12.9, 10. A great part of their Temporal happi|ness was in their <HI>Inheriting</HI> so desirable a Land. It is called a <HI>Pleasant Land, &amp; a Goodly Heritage,</HI> Jer. 3.19. But what is Hea|ven then? Tis said of Canaan, that it was a Land <HI>flowing with Milk &amp; Honey, which was
<PB N="17" REF="039533_0013_10142B588C5103E0">
the Glory of all Lands,</HI> Ezek. 20.6. The blessed satisfactions &amp; sweet enjoyments of heaven were figured thereby. If the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> was a glorious Land, what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> glorious place is Heaven do we think? The holy Patriarcks who sojourned in <HI>Ca|naan desired a better Countrey, that is an Heavenly one,</HI> Heb. 11.16.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The happiness of Saints in the heavenly world, is set forth by resembling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t to <HI>Riches.</HI> That you may know <HI>what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the Riches:</HI> Riches imply more than a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ittle: One that has but a little, is not a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ich man.

Eccl. 1.2. Some of the richest men in this world, have been the most miserable men when they have gone out of the world. It was said to the rich man in Hell; <HI>Re|member that in thy life-time thou receivedst thy good things, but now thou art tormented,</HI> Luk. 16.25. One of the <HI>Popes</HI> said, he could never think of those words without horror. Nevertheless, men are apt to esteem those who are rich to be very hap|py: Mal. 3.15. <HI>We call the proud</HI> (i. e. the rich who are commonly proud) <HI>hap|py.</HI> Therefore is the happiness of heaven set forth by great Riches. In heaven there are riches: there are treasures there, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.20. As for the riches of this world they are deceitful. Many a man has tho't with himself, if he could but get such an Estate, how happy should he be; but when he has obtained it, he has found him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">self miserably deceived. But in heaven there is <HI>the true Riches,</HI> Luk. 16.11. There are some Cities which have an abundance of Riches in them, but never any City s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rich, as the City of God the heavenly <HI>Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rusalem.</HI> The wall of this City is said to

The street is of pure Gold; and as for the gates of it, they were all Pearls: Every several gate was one <HI>Pearl.</HI> A Pearl as big as a mans finger, is of great Value: but a Pearl as big as the gate of a City, is that the like whereunto was never known. It is therefore (as a Learned Divine in his <HI>Exposition</HI> on this Scripture observes) an <HI>holy Fiction</HI>; inti|mating that the happiness of heaven is so great, as the world affords nothing com|parable to it.

When he dies, his glory shall not descend after him.</HI> Glory is some|times the same with <HI>Honour.</HI> These are the two things which men most earnestly desire: If they can obtain these two, Riches and Honour with it, they think they shall want nothing to make them happy: Eccl. 6.2. <HI>A man to whom God giveth riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wants nothing for his Soul of all that he de|sires.</HI> Both these expressions are used to let us understand what a desirable and happy world the heavenly world is. Hea|venly Riches, and heavenly Honours in|finitely transcend Earthly ones. Christ says, <HI>If any man serve me, him will my Fa|ther honour.</HI> It may be God will put ho|nour upon him in this world; but to be sure in another world, in Heaven and at the Last Day in the Resurrection world&punc; Then will he commend their Fidelity in the hearing of all Angels and Men: Mat.

That's the most Glorious Crown that ever was.</P>
<P N="3">3. If we compare the happiness of Hea|ven with other things, we shall see that it is wonderfully Great. If we compare it either with the Good things, or the Evil things of this world. If we compare Earth and Heaven together, we shall see there is no comparison between them. Before Sin entred into the world, the Earth|ly <HI>Paradise</HI> was a delightful place. It was the Garden of <HI>Eden</HI>; that is of <HI>Plea|sure.</HI> The <HI>Heavenly Paradise</HI> does infi|nitely excel the Earthly Paradise in all that is desirable. There are things be|longing

to the Earth, which make it de|sirable to Earthly men: There are hidden <HI>Treasures</HI> in it, with which God fills the Bellies of some men, who have their Por|tion in this Life. There are precious Stones, Silver, and Gold in the bowels of it: But no <HI>Eternal Riches,</HI> as there is in Heaven: Heb. 10.34. <HI>Knowing that you have in Heaven a better &amp; an endu|ring Substance.</HI> There are Pleasures to be enjoyed on the Earth; but not Ever|lasting Pleasures. Whenas in Heaven there are <HI>Pleasures for evermore.</HI> There it is that God makes his Saints <HI>to Drink of the River of his Pleasures,</HI> Psal. 36.8. The <HI>Souls</HI> in heaven swim in holy Pleasures, and they are <HI>Perpetual,</HI> like a River that keeps running from age to age. There are Honours to be enjoyed on the Earth; but not Everlasting Honours. Death will soon put an end to all worldly Grandieur. But Heavenly Glory will last to Eternity, as hereafter we shall shew. This Earth it self is but like a Stage, which is set up but for a while, and then it must be pulled down. The <HI>Scheme,</HI> the <HI>Fashion of this
<PB N="23" REF="039533_0016_10142B5FC08CB388">
world passeth away,</HI> 1 Cor. 7.31. After it has continued a few Thousands of Years, it must be taken down; nay, burnt up. All the Rich and Glorious Cities on the Earth must be destroyed, but Hea|ven is a City which shall stand to Eter|nity. It is a City that has <HI>Foundations.</HI> All the Houses on the Earth shall be con|sumed with Fire at the latter day: 2 Pet. 3.10. <HI>The Elements shall melt with fervent heat; the Earth also &amp; the works which are therein shall be burnt up.</HI> But Heaven is an Eternal House. These things de|clare that there is no comparison between Earthly and Heavenly happiness.</P>
<P>Let us compare the Sufferings of God's Children, whilst they are on the Earth, with the Glory which they shall have in Heaven: Rom. 8.18. <HI>I reckon that the sufferings of this present time, are not wor|thy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us.</HI> That Glory does in|comparably Out-ballance all their Afflic|tions. Put their present Afflictions into One Scale, and their future Glory into the Other Scale, and the weight of Glory
<PB N="24" REF="039533_0017_10142B61AA7A4868">
Out-weighs Wonderfully. The weight of Glory does exceed by far and far, the heaviest Affliction that ever any Saint of God was subject unto in this world; sup|pose him to have been as grievously Af|flicted as <HI>Job</HI> was, who Complains that if his Grief were throughly weighed, and his Calamity laid in the balances together, it would be <HI>Heavier than the sand of the Sea.</HI> All these Afflictions are as light as a Feather, compared with the <HI>Weight of Glory in Heaven.</HI> Sometimes One Afflic|tion will Weigh down all the Good and Comfort of this World. If a man is sub|ject to a Tormenting Disease, he would willingly part with all his Estate, to be de|livered from that Misery: But the Glory of Heaven Out-balances all. There is no more comparison between them, than there is between a few Sands &amp; a Moun|tain.</P>
<P N="4">4. If we consider whose <HI>Inheritance</HI> this is, we must conclude that it is a Rich and Glorious One. It is <HI>Gods Inhe|ritance:</HI> The Riches of the Glory of <HI>His</HI> Inheritance. It is said to be <HI>His,</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="25" REF="039533_0017_10142B61AA7A4868">(1.) Because He is the Bestower of it: Tis his glorious Gift; Psal. 84.11. <HI>He giveth Glory.</HI> If he gives Glory, He will give like himself. It is reported concern|ing a great King, that when he bestowed an Extraordinary Bounty, the Receiver said the Gift was <HI>too great</HI>; he had not de|served so much: That Liberal King repli'd, <HI>If it is too much for you to receive, it is not too much for me to give.</HI> The greatest <HI>Riches of Glory</HI> is not <HI>too great</HI> for God to give: He has infinite Riches: Enough to make Millions of needy Creatures exceed|ing Rich: <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.19. <HI>God shall supply all your need, according to his Riches in Glory.</HI> He has not Only Glory , but Riches of Glo|ry: He can make Thousands of Millions of poor Creatures Vastly rich. Can we think, that the <HI>Great</HI> GOD will bestow a <HI>Small Patrimony</HI> on his Children? Most certainly, the Adopted Children of God will be the Richest Heirs in the world. Believers are <HI>Heirs of God, and Joynt-heirs with Christ,</HI> Rom. 8.17. Parents bestow Inheritances or Portions on their Children, according to what Estate they have: They
<PB N="26" REF="039533_0018_10142B66A5C22EF8">
that are Vastly Rich, will give Portions accordingly. What a Rich and Glorious Inheritance then will the Infinite GOD bestow on every Child of his?</P>
<P N="2">(2.) This Inheritance is said to be <HI>His,</HI> because it is his Propriety and Possession. That cannot but be a Rich and Glorious Inheritance, which is God's own Posses|sion: This is true concerning that Hea|ven which his Saints shall Inherit. An Acute and Worthy Divine Observes, that <HI>David</HI> does by this, prove that they who Fear the Lord are the happiest men in the world; Psal. 115.15, 16. <HI>You are bles|sed of the Lord, which made Heaven and Earth: The Heaven, even the Heavens are the Lords; but the Earth hath he given to the Children of men.</HI> As for the Earth, he gives that to the Sons of men: Let them take it says the Lord, I give it to them; it shall be their Inheritance. But that is not an Inheritance good enough for GOD. No: The Heaven of Heavens is <HI>His:</HI> Therefore how happy must his Saints be, when he will take them up to that Heaven which he has reserved for himself?</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="27" REF="039533_0018_10142B66A5C22EF8">5. If we consider the Properties of this happiness, which the Saints of God shall enjoy in the heavenly World, we shall see that it is wonderfully great.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) It will Continue for ever &amp; ever. This is implied when it is called an <HI>Inhe|ritance.</HI> Saints in heaven are not like <HI>Tenants</HI> at will; but they are <HI>Heirs.</HI> When an Inheritance is made over to a man, it useth to be <HI>to him and to his heirs for ever.</HI> The Inheritance of heaven is by the firm|est Deed that possibly can be, made over to Christ and to his Heirs for ever; Rom. 8.17. <HI>Joint-heirs with Christ.</HI> Other In|heritances are but Temporal: This is an <HI>Eternal Inheritance,</HI> Heb. 9.15. Other In|heritances may Corrupt; but this is an <HI>Inheritance Incorruptible,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.4. In this World men may have their Riches taken from them, by One means or other; but <HI>Heavenly Treasures</HI> can never be lost. An Eminent Christian when he was at a Feast, would sometimes say; <HI>Here is good Company, and so there is in Heaven; here is a Feast, &amp; so there is in Heaven:
<PB N="28" REF="039533_0019_10142B6954ABEE60">
but here is</HI> Taking away; <HI>whenas there is none of that in Heaven.</HI> They that chuse Heaven for their Portion, shall not have it taken from them. <HI>David</HI> was much af|fected with the Mercy of God, in that he had not only given him a Kingdom; but had promised that it should be Established in his Family for a Long time to come. <HI>This</HI> (said he) <HI>was a small thing in thy sight.</HI> Did he think, the bestowing of a Kingdom on him was a small thing? No: It was a great thing: But the continuance of it in his Family for a long time, made it a much greater Mercy. Saints in Heaven enjoy a Kingdom, <HI>not for a long time only</HI>; but beyond all time throughout eternal ages. <HI>An entrance is ministred to them abundant|ly, into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord &amp; Saviour Jesus Christ,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.11. If a man should enjoy the Blessedness of the Heavenly World, if it were but for One Day, that would be a greater happiness than for him to enjoy all the Consolations which earth can afford for Thousands of Years; but what then is it to enjoy that Blessedness throughout the never ending Days of Eternity?</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="29" REF="039533_0019_10142B6954ABEE60">(2.) Another property of this Happi|ness, is, that it admits of no Interruption, no Intermission. It is a Spring Tide that has no Ebb; a Summer that has no Win|ter; a Day that has no Night following it; <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.25. The Gates shall not at all be shut, <HI>for there shall be no Night there.</HI> There have been Saints on earth, who have sometimes had a great Intimacy of Com|munion with God; and then they have thought how Happy should they be, if it might be always thus: Oh! it was good to be here. But, alas! This Heaven upon Earth was soon interrupted. Soul Ra|vishing Joy, has been as that Ancient said; <HI>Rara hota et brevis mora:</HI> A rare hour and of short stay. Old <HI>Bernards</HI> Companion being filled with Joy, said; <HI>He hoped he should never be Sad more as long as he Li|ved:</HI> His Joy was soon gone, and then he <HI>feared he should never have Comfort any more; but be Disconsolate all his Days.</HI> But Saints in Heaven have Joy without any intermission: <HI>Pleasures for evermore.</HI> The Consolation of Heaven is an <HI>Everlasting Consolation.</HI> The Tree of Life is said to
<PB N="30" REF="039533_0020_101416EFB89A7A80">
yield its Fruit every <HI>Month</HI>; intimating the uninterruptedness of the Delights of Heaven.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Another property of this Happi|ness, is, that it is not subject to any Fa|ding. Tis called <HI>an Inheritance that Fa|deth not away</HI>; and <HI>a Crown of Glory that Fadeth not.</HI> Things in this World which have a singular Beauty and Glory in them, quickly Fade and Wither. Tis said of the Lily, that <HI>Solomon</HI> in all his glory was not arrayed like unto it: But it soon wi|thers. Heavens Glory does not so. Here men are taken with a pleasant Object for a while; but when they are used to it; they <HI>Loose</HI> their Esteem of it. In heaven nothing Withers; nothing grows Old and Stale. After a Saint has been in Heaven as many Millions of Ages as there are Sands on the Sea-shore, the <HI>Glory</HI> of Hea|ven is as Fresh and Delightful to him, as it was the first Day of his coming there.</P>

<HI>Reward</HI>? Has not Christ Promised that it shall?

<P N="3">3 Some Saints have been greater Suf|ferers for Christ than others have. If we Suffer with him, we shall Reign with him.

<P>THE Design of the Apostle in the Context before us, is, to Excite Believers unto Holi|ness: This is urged from the Consideration of those great Priviledges which they are the sub|jects of. Singular Mercies call for singu|lar

Obedience and Holiness. Believers under the New Testament are Priviledged above those of the Old Testament: They are under a more Gracious dispensation. The Gospel state of the Church is far more Excellent &amp; Desirable than the Le|gal state was. That which remains is far more Glorious: Therefore a greater mea|sure of holiness is required and expected from those who are concerned in it. This, with the preceding and following Verse contains the Priviledges which Believers receive by the Gospel.

As for the Literal <HI>Sion,</HI> it had two heads; On One of which the Temple was Built,

By <HI>the Spirits</HI> of Just men, their <HI>never Dying Souls</HI> are meant. Every man does consist of two essential Parts, a Soul and a Body: The first man that ever was made did so: And all other men do so. <HI>The Soul</HI> is often in the Scripture cal|led the <HI>Spirit</HI>: Especially the Soul in a state of separation from the Body: For

There is the Vege|tative Life of a Plant, the Sensitive Life of a Beast, the Intellectual Life of an An|gel. Man by reason of his Soul has all these Lives. He has not only a Mortal, but an Immortal Life. His Soul coming from God, when the Body Dies does not go downward, but upward to him who gave the first Soul to Man. So says <HI>Solo|mon,</HI> Eccl. 12.7. <HI>The Dust shall return to the Earth as it was: and the</HI> Spirit <HI>shall re|turn to God who gave it.</HI> Wherefore when men Dy, they are said to <HI>Depart:</HI> Their Bodies do not depart from the Earth: <HI>they</HI>

complains, that the Comforter which should relieve her Soul, was far from her. There are none of these Complaints in Heaven. The blessed Souls there, have the Face of GOD always shining upon them.

Throne of God there, they are Sinless &amp; Faultless: Rev. 14.5. <HI>They are without Fault before the Throne of God.</HI></P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) They are perfectly delivered from Original Sin, That which the Scripture calls the <HI>Sin that dwells in us</HI>; under which holy men Mourn as long as they continue in this world: Rom. 7.24. <HI>O wretched man that I am, Who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</HI> One of the Ancients fitly compares indwelling sin to Ivy in the Wall of an House. Others have as fitly compared it to the Leprosy in the House of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> which must be pulled down before it could be perfectly cleansed and cleared of that woful Evil, <HI>Lev.</HI> 13.45. A man becomes a sin|ful Creature, as soon as there is an Union between his soul and his body; and the <HI>just man</HI> ceaseth to be a sinner, when that Union is dissolved. When he giveth up the ghost, indwelling sin giveth up the ghost with him. The habit of sin is wholly Eradicated out of his soul.

<P>Hence,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) There is a perfect blessed freedom from all Actual Sin. When once the Just mans Soul is in Heaven, he shall never sin more, in Word Thought or Deed; never have one Vain Thought in his mind, nor speak one Unprofitable Word throughout the Days of Eternity. The Just mans spirit when separated from his body, is in a place where there never was any Sin: For there never was any Sin in Heaven, which is therefore called an <HI>Inheritance Undefiled.</HI> If sin had been committed there, it would have defiled Heaven, as it did Pa|radise. And there never shall be sin there. <HI>There shall in no wise enter into it any thing that Defileth,</HI> Rev. 21 27. On Earth there is not a man wholly free from sin: Eccl. 7.20. <HI>There is not a just man on Earth, that doeth good, &amp; sinneth not.</HI> But in Heaven there are Just men who never sin: and none

but such are there. In Heaven they are in the immediate presence of GOD, and are always sensible that they are so; and therefore they sin not. When their Souls are <HI>absent from the Body,</HI> they are <HI>present with the Lord,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.8. The Lord Je|sus Christ receives their Souls, and pre|sents them to God.

Dr. <HI>Goodwin</HI> speaks of an holy man, who when Dying Express'd himself after this manner, <HI>Notwithstanding I am assur'd that God Loves me, and will receive my Soul; nevertheless, I should be afraid to appear before so Glorious a Presence, did I not know that Christ is in Heaven to present me to Him.</HI> Therefore the Souls of Just men when <HI>Separated</HI> from their Bodies are sin|less: For Christ will present them as with|out sin to his Father: Jude 24 <HI>He is able to present you faultless before the presence of his Glory.</HI> Moreover, there is in the hearts of some holy men, an earnest desire to de|part out of this, and to go to the Heavenly world, for this Reason Especially; that they may be perfectly freed from Sin. The
<PB N="75" REF="039533_0042_10142BA7360ADAA8">
holy Spirit of GOD has wrought this de|sire in their hearts. He would not put such longings into their souls, if he did not intend to give them their desire. Some may be ready to say, <HI>But how is it possible that a Soul which has so much sin in it, should be made perfectly pure from sin in a moment of time</HI>? To this that answer may be given, which the Angel gave to the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>; when she was astonished at the wonderful thing God would do for her, and said, <HI>How can this be</HI>? The Angel said, <HI>To God nothing is unpossible.</HI> GOD is able to cause such a wonderful Change in the Soul to be ac|complished in One Day, in One Moment. GOD who Converts a Soul from a state of sin in a moment; who turns a Sinner into a Saint in a moment, as he has often done, can make a <HI>Sinful</HI> Soul to become a <HI>Sin|less</HI> Soul in a moment. And the Conside|ration of what shall be done to the Saints, whom Christ shall find alive on the Earth when he shall come to Judge the World at the Last Day, may Confirm our Faith con|cerning this also. Their Bodies &amp; their Souls too will be wonderfully Changed in

a moment. Just before the Last Trumpet shall sound, they will have <HI>Souls</HI> &amp; <HI>Bodies</HI> subject to Sin: but as soon as the Trum|pet is heard sounding, they are made Per|fect in a moment. <HI>Behold, I shew you a Mystery; We shall not all Sleep, but we shall all be Changed, in a moment, in the twink|ling of an eye, at the last Trump, (for the Trumpet shall sound, and the Dead shall be raised Incorruptible, &amp; we shall be Changed,)</HI> 1 Cor. 15.51, 52. And thus it was with <HI>Enoch,</HI> &amp; <HI>Elijah,</HI> when they were Tran|slated: Before their Translation they were subject to sin; but in a moment perfect|ly freed from sin. Why then should it not be so with the Souls of Just men, when they are Translated from Earth to Hea|ven? But this shall be further Confirmed and Cleared in the next <HI>Proposition.</HI></P>

finished, <HI>Philippians</HI> 1.6. The habit of Grace which was wrought in the Soul by Regeneration, does not Dy with the Body; but goes with the Soul to Heaven &amp; into Eternity. Grace is a Seed of God which remains; an Anointing which abides in the soul. Death is so far from divesting the soul of its Graces, as that it perfects in a moment what was defective in them. Per|fection in Grace is the desire of every Godly man in this world; but the attain|ment of none. Tis Heavens attainment. Believers whilst in this world, are partly spiritual and partly carnal; partly holy &amp; partly sinful: There is flesh and spirit in a continual Combat: But in Heaven all is spiritual, all is holy. The Will of the glo|rify'd soul is perfectly Conformed to the will of God. <HI>Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven;</HI> So we are to Pray, and the Expression does imply, that among the Saints in Heaven, there is a perfect Con|formity to the Will of GOD.

There is no disorder in their Affections; they are ne|ver out of frame, as too often they are in this world.

The spirits of Just men there, are made perfect in Love. There is no Fear there, but all is Love. Glorify'd souls are always in a flame of Love to God &amp; to Jesus Christ. In Heaven that great Com|mandment is fulfill'd, &amp; that perfectly. The great Commandment is, <HI>Thou shalt Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</HI> In Hea|ven they do so. And as their Love to God, so their Love to one another is per|fect. In Heaven there is Light, and there is Love in the perfection of both. In this world, the best and most holy Servants of Christ, in some lesser points differ in their Judgments, and sometimes in their Affec|tions too. <HI>Paul</HI> &amp; <HI>Barnabas,</HI> altho' A|postles,

Now to encourage the Martyrs, the Spirit says, <HI>Blessed are the Dead which Dy in the Lord.</HI> You may suffer a painful Death, yet be of good Comfort, as soon as ever you are Dead you shall be Blessed. Says the Spirit, when a Righteous man Dies, his Soul is among the Spirits of Just men made perfect in Heaven, hefore his Body is laid in the Grave. Isa. 57.1, 2. <HI>The Righteous is taken away from the Evil to come; he shall enter into Peace, they shall rest in their Beds, i. e.</HI> in their Graves. It is in respect of their Souls that they <HI>enter into Peace</HI>; which imports their being in bles|sed Tranquility, and this as soon as ever they are taken away out of this world, before their Bodies are laid to rest &amp; sleep in the Grave.

Promise which God made to <HI>Abraham</HI>; Gen. 15.15. <HI>Thou shalt go to thy Fathers in Peace; thou shalt be buried in a good Old Age.</HI> That word <HI>Going</HI> to Fathers, is Emphatical; and has respect to the <HI>Soul.</HI> It is true, that that Expression of <HI>Sleeping</HI> with Fathers, is sometimes used in the Scripture to denote no more than <HI>Dying</HI>; it has respect to the <HI>Body,</HI> whose Death is a Sleep: But that great Divine, whom we have diverse times taken notice of, has Judiciously Observed, that <HI>Going</HI> to Fa|thers implies more, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Soul goes to that World where Fathers are gone be|fore.

<P>We proceed to some APPLICATION of the DOCTRINE. There are several <HI>Inferences</HI> from the Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th which has been Explain'd and Confirm'd.</P>
<P>Inf. I. <HI>Christians ought not to Mourn Immoderately, for the Death of their Godly Friends.</HI> The Consideration of their pre|sent Happiness, should Moderate our Griefs. When their Bodies are Dead; if they Dy in the Lord, their Spirits, their Souls are safe and happy. A man who has an Entire Love for another, will Re|joyce at his Friends gain; altho' he should himself lose something by it. It is a Loss to us, when any of our Precious Praying Friends are taken from us by Death: But they are happy Gainers, &amp; that Meditation should quiet us. <HI>For me to Dy is Gain,</HI> said the Apostle. Should we not Rejoyce at our Friends Gain? Especially if they have gained a great Good; if they have gained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Crown, and a Crown of Life too? This Consideration Christ set before his Dis|ciples,
<PB N="94" REF="039533_0052_10142BBCB46C2E68">
to Comfort and Compose their spirits, which were much Troubl'd and Dejected at the thoughts of his Leaving them; Joh. 14.28. <HI>If you Loved me, ye would Rejoyce, because I go to the Father.</HI> So if our Friends and dear Relations who are gone from us, are gone to the Father and to Christ, at that we should Rejoyce. The Death of Children is a sore Affliction, and if they Dy in their Sins, without any signs of Repentance, that aggravates the Bitterness. This made <HI>David</HI> take on so, when <HI>Absalom</HI> was Dead: He was much mov'd, and went into his Chamber and Wept; and thus he said, <HI>O my Son</HI> Ab|salom, <HI>my Son, my Son</HI> Absalom: <HI>would GOD I had Dy'd for thee, O</HI> Absalom <HI>my Son, my Son,</HI> 2 Sam. 18.33.

Some when they have been on the borders of Heaven just ready to take Possession, have had Soul ravishing Joys. There was in <HI>Lanceshire,</HI> a very Religious Gentlewoman, Mrs. <HI>Ca|tharine Brettergh,</HI> who excelled in Charity and other Graces, had great conflicts on her Death-bed, having been (as she ex|pressed it) <HI>in a roring Wilderness of Wo,</HI> but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fter that in unutterable Joys.

The Joys of Heaven are wonderfully great in re|spect of the degree and measure of them. In Heaven there is not only Joy but <HI>ful|ness of Joy,</HI> Psal. 16.11.

The Sinner that dies to day, <HI>to morrow</HI> his Soul will be with Devils: his soul does not go to be with the spirits of Just men made perfect; but to the souls of those Wicked men, who have died and gone to Hell before him. When a wicked man dies, his soul goes to be with the soul of <HI>Cain,</HI> and of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and of <HI>Judas</HI>; with other Sons of Perdition. His de|parted soul is carried to a woful Prison. It is said of the Sinners of the Old Un|godly world, that their <HI>Spirits,</HI> their im|mortal Souls are in <HI>Prison,</HI> 1 Pet. 3.19. Those horrid Giants which Lived before the Flood, their souls are in Hell; and when Ungodly men dy, their souls go to remain with them until the Great Day of Judgment.

Drown'd and Damn'd, when their Founda|tion was Overflown with a Flood. These are represented in the Scripture as being in Misery, and sighing because of their Misery.

Job 27.8. <HI>What is the hope of the Hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?</HI> And which is an infinitely greater Misery, they Despair of ever obtaining the Pardon of their Sins, or the Salvation of their Souls. They know that their Day of Grace is past; and the thought of the ter|rible Sentence which will be passed upon them at the great Day of Judgment, fills them with unspeakable Anguish and Hor|ror.

Whence <HI>Zadok,</HI> and those which were his Followers, con|cluded there would be no future Reward: Consequently no future World, or Resur|rection from the Dead. Some of these came to our Lord JESUS CHRIST with an Objection&punc; which they thought was an unanswerable Argument against the Resurrection of the Dead. They pre|tended that there was a Woman Married to Seven Husbands successively: If there shall be a Resurrection, whose Wife of the Seven shall she then be? Christ gives them to understand, that they Reasoned like Ignorant men; and their want of Know|ledge was the cause of their great Error. Another Evangelist asserts, that he said to them, <HI>Ye do Err, not knowing the Scrip|tures, nor the Power of God,</HI> Mat. 22.29. The Scriptures affirm a Resurrection of the Dead. The Ancient <HI>Sadduces</HI> owned no part of the Scripture to be a Foundation for Faith, besides the Five Books of <HI>Moses.</HI> Therefore Christ Confuted them out of
<PB N="107" REF="039533_0058_10142BCDFA3C9990">
One of those Books, for which they pre|tended the greatest Veneration. Nor were they duely apprehensive of what the Scripture declares concerning the in|finite Power of GOD. Had they Con|sidered that as they ought to have done, they would not have tho't it impossible, nor would it have seem'd incredible to them, that He should Raise the Dead. Further to Convince them of their Error, Christ informs them, that they Argued from a false Principle: For their Objection supposeth, that in the <HI>Resurrection World</HI> there will be Marrying and giving in Marriage. Which is a very false Suppo|sal, &amp; a gross Error. For altho' in this world, Marriage among mortal Men is neces|sary for the continuance of Mankind: In that World in which men shall be immor|taliz'd, there will be no more Marriage than there is among the Angels of Hea|ven. <HI>Holy Angels</HI> are in the Scripture call'd the <HI>Sons of God,</HI> in respect of Simili|tude: They resemble the immortal GOD, more than any Other Creatures do.

This is a truth which has been but little believed: Very few comparatively have given credit to it. For it is not known by the Light of Nature; Only by Divine Re|velation.

GOD by his Spirit and Power <HI>Reviveth the Face of the Earth,</HI> Psal. 104.30. We see Corn is cast into the Ground, it Dyeth there, and yet utter that it Riseth again.

After the like manner does the Apostle reason, 1 Cor. 15.35, &mdash; <HI>Some will say, How are the Dead raised? with what body do they come? That which thou sowest, is not quickned, except it Dye. God giveth it a body; as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</HI> When the Bodies of men are put into the Grave, they are sowen there; they will spring up at last, altho' it may be long first. There is also a notable Repre|sentation of the Resurrection, by that which some Naturalists Observe, <HI>viz.</HI> That if Plants are Consumed to Ashes, &amp; those Ashes turn'd into Salt, out of that Salt there may be made to spring up the perfect form of the Plants so Dissolv'd.

The Resurrection is asserted in the Scrip|tures of the Old Testament. Therefore the <HI>Jewish Church</HI> believed it: Their Faith of the Resurrection was built in special on that Scripture, Dan. 12.2. <HI>Many of them that sleep in the Dust of the Earth shall awake, some to everlasting Life, and some to Shame and everlasting Contempt.</HI> Sometimes in the Scripture, (and indeed very often) <HI>All</HI> denotes <HI>Many</HI>; and sometimes <HI>Many</HI> is put for <HI>All:</HI> So tis in the Scripture mention'd.

It strikes at a Fundamental Article in our Christian Religion. I shall therefore fur|ther insist on the Truth before us, and mention several things for our Confirma|tion and Establishment in the Faith of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The holy Scriptures Expresly de|clare a Resurrection of the same Body. <HI>Job</HI> believ'd, that notwithstanding his Bo|dy should be Consumed in the Grave, he should Rise again at the Last day with the very same Body. I will not trouble you with the Critical Disputes of Learn'd men, about the translation of his words
<PB N="121" REF="039533_0065_10142BE2B96FACA0">
but in our <HI>English</HI> Bibles they run thus, <HI>I know that my Redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the latter Day on the Earth; and though after my skin Worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for my self, &amp; mine eyes shall be|hold, &amp; not another, tho' my reins be con|sumed within me,</HI> Job 19.25, 26, 27.

One reason why Believers shall have Bodily Eyes re|stored to them at the Latter day, is, that so they may behold the Glory of the <HI>God-man</HI> JESUS CHRIST. <HI>Job</HI> more|over says, <HI>I, my self,</HI> and <HI>not another.</HI> How can words be more Exprest? And does not the Apostle say, <HI>This Corruptible</HI> (not a|nother but <HI>this</HI> Corruptible) shall put on Incorruption? 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.53. He speaks

And altho' since his Ascension, his Body is become more Glorious than the Sun in the Firmament: When he appeared to <HI>Saul,</HI> it was with a <HI>Light above the brightness of the Sun,</HI> Act. 26.13. Yet nevertheless, it remains a body still. That very Body which was Once hanging on the Cross at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> is now at the Right Hand of GOD in Heaven. From Heaven he declares, as in Rev. 1.18. <HI>I am He that Liveth &amp; was Dead; and behold I am Alive for ever|more.</HI> The same Body which was Dead is now Alive, and may be seen with bodily Eyes: For so did the Martyr <HI>Stephen</HI> see him, Act. 7.55, 56. <HI>He Looked up stead|fastly into Heaven, &amp; saw the Glory of God, &amp; Jesus standing at the Right Hand of God.</HI> There appeared a wonderful Glo|ry; and at the Right Hand of that Glory, he saw the Man JESUS standing; he said, <HI>I see the Heavens Opened, &amp; the Son of Man standing at the Right Hand of God.</HI>

How does that stand with Justice? And as for the Faith|ful Servant of Christ, his Body has joyned with his Soul in serving the Lord; and therefore that very Body shall be a Sub|ject of Glory.

<P N="4">4. The Bodies as well as the Souls of Believers are Redeemed by Christ, Uni|ted to Him, and Sanctified by his Spirit dwelling in them. Therefore they are the bodies, and not Others instead of them, which shall be Raised up to Eternal Life at the Last Day. That very body which the believing soul now lives in, and shall dye and be put into the grave, has been Redeemed with the Blood of Christ, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.20. Can we imagine, that the body which Christ has Purchased with his Blood, shall never Rise out of the Grave; but that his soul after the Resurrection shall dwell in another body, which Christ never dy'd for the Redemption of it? That body which belongs to Christ as a mem|ber of his Mystical Body, which is Uni|ted to him shall Rise to Glory. This is to be affirm'd of the mortal body, which the believing soul now abides in. 1 Cor. 6.15. <HI>Know ye not that your Bodies are the members of Christ?</HI> Christ has by his Spirit taken Possession, not Only of the
<PB N="127" REF="039533_0068_10142BE8006691D0">
believers soul, but of his body also: which is the reason of its being raised up to an Everlasting Life: Rom. 8.11. <HI>If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the Dead, Dwell in You: He that raised Christ from the Dead, shall also Quicken your mortal Bo|dies, by his Spirit which Dwells in you.</HI> That body in which the Holy Spirit dwells, is the body that shall dy, and that shall be made alive again. The body of the true Believer is a subject of Sanctification; and therefore that very body shall be a subject of Glorification. He has given himself, soul and body to God in Jesus Christ, and has served God with both; therefore both shall Live Eternally: Rom. 12.1. <HI>Present your Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, accep|table unto GOD, which is your reasonable Service.</HI></P>

<P>In Order to the Clearing and Confir|mation of the Truth before us, several things may be mentioned as Demonstra|tations of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Children of GOD shall <HI>in that World,</HI> in diverse respects attain unto An|gelical Perfection. The Text before us says, <HI>They shall be Equal to the Angels</HI>: Which another Evangelist Expresseth by saying, They shall be <HI>as the Angels of GOD in Heaven</HI>: i. e. Very like unto them. Which is not to be so understood, as if they should in all respects be as the An|gels are. We may not suppose, that the Humane Nature shall be turned into the Angelical Nature. <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Angels</HI> are of different Natures. It is said of our Sa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iour Christ, that since the Children of GOD <HI>are partakers of Flesh &amp; Blood, He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lso himself likewise took part of the same,</HI> Heb. 2.14. Angels have not Flesh and
<PB N="130" REF="039533_0070_101416F485E95610">
Blood. Nor did Christ take on him the Angelical Nature, <HI>verse</HI> 16. Angels have not bodies as Christ had, and still has, and ever will have, a body which (as former|ly was said) may be seen with bodily eyes. Mark 14.62. <HI>You shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of Power, and coming in the Clouds of Heaven.</HI> Then the Eyes of every man in the World shall see him. Rev. 1.7. <HI>Behold, he cometh with Clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they also that pierced him.</HI> But the Angelical Nature is invisible to bodily eyes. And therefore when tis said, That the Chil|dren of the Resurrection shall be <HI>as the An|gels,</HI> we may not think that they will loose their Humane Nature, and be turned into Angels. <HI>Angels</HI> are in respect of their Nature, <HI>Spirits</HI>: Psal. 104.4. <HI>He has made his Angels Spirits</HI>: but men shall not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> made Spirits.

difference. If it is a Spirit it is not a Body; if it is a Body it is not a Spirit. When therefore Christ appeared to his Disciples, after his Resurrection; and they were terrified supposing they had seen a <HI>Spirit</HI>; to convince them of their Error he said to them, <HI>A Spirit has not Flesh and Bones as you see me have,</HI> Luk. 24.39.

<P>More particularly,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Angels excel in Wisdom &amp; Know|ledge. It is said concerning the particu|lar Time when the Day of Judgment shall begin, <HI>Of that Hour knows no man, no not the Angels of heaven,</HI> Mat. 24.36. impor|ting that Angels have a great measure of Knowledge. Davids great Wisdom was set forth by saying, He was <HI>wise according to the Wisdom of an Angel of God, to know all things that are on the Earth,</HI> 2 Sam. 14.20. The Children of the Resurrection shall be adorned with Angelical Know|ledge. If their Souls attain unto a Mar|vellous Perfection in Knowledge whilest in their Separate State, (as from another Scripture has been declared) that Know|ledge will not be diminished by a re-union with the Body, in the Resurrection World&punc; What an imperfect Knowledge has a Child compared with the Knowledge of a Lear|ned man?

the Children of God have whilest in <HI>this World,</HI> and that which they shall have in <HI>that World.</HI> Hence the Apostle speaks as in 1 Cor. 13.11. <HI>When I was a Child, I spake as a Child, I understood as a Child, I thought as a Child, but when I became a Man I put away Childish things.</HI> Our Knowledge now is weak and childish, but then it will be manly and perfect.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Angels of heaven are called <HI>Holy Angels,</HI> Math. 25.31. They are the <HI>Holy Ones</HI> the Prophet speaks of, <HI>Dan.</HI> 4 17. They are perfectly pure from Sin. When they appeared to men, their Raiment has been <HI>White,</HI> an Emblem of their <HI>Purity</HI> as well as their <HI>Glory.</HI> But thus shall it be with the Children of God, in the Resur|rection World. They shall have no more Sin in them, than the Angels of heaven have. Then will the Spouse of Christ be <HI>all fair, and no spot in her,</HI> Cant. 4 7. <HI>It will be a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and with|out blemish,</HI> Eph. 5.27.

World. Saints on Earth will then do the Will of God, with a perfection Equal to that of Angels in Heaven.</P>
<P N="2">[2.] The Children of the Resurrection cannot dye. So it is said in the Text be|fore us: <HI>Neither can they dye any more.</HI> It is on this account especially that they are said to be <HI>Equal with the Angels,</HI> viz. In respect of a <HI>blessed Immortality.</HI> It is to be affirmed of Angels, not only that they <HI>shall not,</HI> but that they <HI>cannot</HI> dye. It is said of the Immortal Souls of men that they cannot be killed; much more may it be said of Angels, they cannot be killed. God who made them is able to <HI>Annihilate</HI> them, but they cannot dye: they cannot be resolved into pre-existent Principles, because they were not made out of such. In this World there is not a man but what shall dye: <HI>What man is he that liveth and shall not see death?</HI> But in the Resurrection World there is not one that shall dye. They who were Mortal in <HI>this World,</HI> become Immortal in <HI>that World.</HI> There it is that <HI>Mortality is swallowed up of Life,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.4. So are the Children of the Resurrection,

<HI>as the Angels of heaven.</HI> Some may say, but is it not said of the blessed God, That <HI>He only</HI> has Immortality, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.16. <HI>Ans.</HI> It is most true, that <HI>He only</HI> has Im|mortality <HI>Originally.</HI> He only has Im|mortality <HI>from Himself</HI>: but Angels have <HI>Immortality</HI> by the <HI>Gift of God.</HI> They are not subject to any decay of Nature as Mortal Creatures are.

<P N="2">2. That the Resurrection body will be adorned with very glorious Properties, in respect whereof wonderful will be the Happiness of the Children of God, in the Resurrection World.

Since Sin has entred into the world, there is nothing more subject to Mortality, than the frail Bodies of men. They no sooner begin to Live, but they begin to Dy: They are subject to Death by a thousand Casualties; also by inward Diseases. There are the seeds of all Di|seases in the body, which prove Mortal to it. Besides, Nature does in time decay. If there were no other Disease to hasten Death, Old Age is a Disease which will infallibly bring to the Grave at last; and there it becomes <HI>Corruption</HI> it self. Job 17.14. <HI>I have said to Corruption, thou art my Father; to the Worm thou art my Mother &amp; my Sister.</HI> They and I shall dwell in the same House together, as Fathers and Mo|thers, and Brothers and Sisters use to do. The Grave is that House. But the Re|surrection body is subject to no Death: It
<PB N="137" REF="039533_0073_10142BF68E365DE0">
will be an <HI>heavenly body.</HI> Then the souls of Believers will be Cloathed upon, and dwell in <HI>their House which is from heaven.</HI> 2 Cor. 5.1. <HI>They have born the image of the Earthly; but they shall bear the image of the Heavenly,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.49. The Re|surrection Body will abide like <HI>the Days of heaven,</HI> without being subject to any De|cay. There have been some few in the world, whose bodies had been Dead, but were restored to Life again: So it was with <HI>Lazarus</HI>; and some few Others men|tioned in the Scripture, both in the Old and in the New Testament. These Dy'd again. It shall not be so with the Chil|dren of God in the Resurrection at the Last Day. They shall have a <HI>better Resur|rection</HI> than those had, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.35. When they awake out of the dust where their bodies have been sleeping, it will be <HI>to Everlasting Life,</HI> Dan. 12.2.

<PB N="138" REF="039533_0074_10142BF878DC4A28">
Children of God, when they are Once the Children of the Resurrection. But more than this is impli'd in the <HI>Incorruptibility</HI> of the Body. If <HI>Adam</HI> had not Sinn'd, he shou'd have been Immortal; he shou'd never have Died; which was implied in the Threat|ning, in case he did Eat of the Forbidden Tree; <HI>In the Day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely Dye,</HI> Gen. 2.17. We might ra|tionally infer, that if he did continue in his Obedience, he should surely Live and not Dy: Yet we cannot say, that he should have been <HI>Incorruptible.</HI> When tis said the Resurrection Body will be Incorrupti|ble, that intends its not being subject to a|ny Alteration. <HI>Adam</HI>'s body before Sin entred into the world, was naturally sub|ject to Alteration: It was naturally sub|ject to an expense of Spirits, and might have been killed with Hunger, and would have been so, if Food had not been mi|nistred to him. The <HI>Tree of Life</HI> was pro|vided for him, which had (I doubt not) a Natural Vertue in it for the prolonga|tion of Life. Therefore his Body was not made <HI>Incorruptible.</HI> It was subject to

Passion. A great blow would have hurt it. Fire would have consumed it. But the Resurrection Body will be <HI>Impassible</HI>: No Natural thing can hurt it. That which hapned to the three Princes who were cast into <HI>Nebuchadnezzars burning fiery Furnace, upon whose Bodies the Fire had no Power,</HI> was a Miraculous Providence; but the Resurrection Bodies of the Chil|dren of God, will not be subject to suffer|ings by Fire any more than their Souls shall. In this the Raised Bodies of Saints and Sinners will differ. And Believers shall be far more happy than <HI>Adam</HI> was. It could not be said of <HI>Adam, he cannot Dye.</HI> He was sensible that he might possibly Dy. Nor did the Serpent say to our first Pa|rent, that there was no <HI>Possibility</HI>; only that there was no <HI>Certainty</HI> of their Dying upon their Eating the forbidden Fruit. He said, Gen. 3.4. <HI>You shall not surely Dy.</HI> But the <HI>Resurrection Body</HI> of the Believer, is so Immortaliz'd as that there is not a Possibility of its Dying any more, which is meant by the <HI>Incorrupti|bility</HI> of it. Thus are the Children of

the Resurrection, <HI>Equal to the Angels.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) Another Property of the Resur|rection Body, is the <HI>Glory</HI> wherewith it shall be Adorned: 1 Cor. 15.43. <HI>It is sown in Dishonour, it is raised in Glory.</HI> Two things may be implied in that Glory: One of which is the Admirable <HI>Beauty</HI> of the Resurrection Body. <HI>Adam</HI> in his first Creation was a very Beautiful Person; without doubt far Exceeding <HI>Absalom</HI> in Beauty, of whom it is said, <HI>That in all</HI> Is|rael <HI>there was none so much to be Praised as</HI> Absalom <HI>for his Beauty; from the sole of his Foot even to the crown of his Head, there was no blemish in him,</HI> 2 Sam. 14.25. Some who are the Children of God, in this world have great Deformities in their Bo|dies. And the most Beautiful Bodies, soon after they are Dead become Deformed; therefore are said to be <HI>sown in Dishonour</HI>&punc; When the Body is <HI>Sown,</HI> when it is put un|der Ground, it soon becomes a deformed unlovely <HI>Carcass:</HI> But when Raised from Death, the Beauty of it will be Perfect&punc; because of the Comeliness which God wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> then put upon it.

<HI>Brightness</HI> as well as Beauty; A <HI>shi|ning Splendor.</HI> This is Emphatically cal|led Glory. Ver. 41. <HI>There is One Glory of the Sun, and another Glory of the Moon, and another Glory of the Stars; for One Star Differs from another Star in Glory.</HI> The Sun Out-shines the Moon; the Moon Out-shines the Planets. These are <HI>two great Lights,</HI> Gen. 1.16. The Moon Out-shines the other Planets, which are <HI>Stars of Light,</HI> Psal, 148.3. Planets shine with a greater Light than fixed Stars. Some of these shine with a greater Light than Others. Hence are they said to differ in <HI>Glory.</HI> And so will it be with the Children of God, in the Resurrection world. Whil'st in this world, their Souls are in a dark Lanthorn: The Earthly Body is a dark Lanthorn; but it will not be so after the Resurrection. That <HI>Celestial Body</HI> will shine Gloriously. When our Saviour <HI>Christ</HI> was Transfigured in the holy Mount, and <HI>Moses</HI> &amp; <HI>Elias</HI> appeared in Glory, tis said, <HI>His Face did shine as the Sun, and his Rai|ment was white as the Light.</HI> This was but a Glympse of that Glory which CHRIST
<PB N="142" REF="039533_0076_10142BFE4D6634D0">
and his Saints shall appear in at the Last Day. When <HI>Moses</HI> had been Conversing with GOD in the Mount, his Face shone with such Brightness, that the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were not able to Look upon him for <HI>the Glory of his Countenance,</HI> 2 Cor. 3.7. Much more will it be so, when the Chil|dren of GOD shall Ever be with the LORD. It is said of <HI>Stephen,</HI> that when he was convented before the Council, <HI>they saw his Face as it had been the Face of an Angel</HI>; importing that it did shine with rays of Light, as the Face of an appearing Angel used to do, <HI>Act.</HI> 6.15. with <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.3. How much more will the Faces of GOD's Children shine in the Resurrec|tion World; when they shall be as the An|gels of God in Heaven? The Scripture says, that <HI>they shall shine as the brightness of the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever &amp; ever,</HI> Dan. 12.3. Nay, more; They shall <HI>shine as the Sun.</HI> This is a great Truth, and men cannot Easily believe it: Wherefore CHRIST affirms it with great Solemnity; Mat. 13.43. <HI>Then shall the Righteous shine forth as the Sun, in the

Kingdom of their Father. Who has Ears to hear, Let him hear</HI>; Importing that this is so wonderful a Truth, as that <HI>Men</HI> will hardly give Credit to it. There is no Creature seen by us, that shines with so great a Glory as <HI>the Sun</HI> does. Therefore is that Glory made use of to set forth the Glory of the <HI>Resurrection Body.</HI> Not but that it will Out-shine the Sun. The Bodies of the Saints (says a Famous Di|vine) <HI>will so shine, as to Eclipse the Glory of the Sun</HI>; for which he produces that Scripture, Isai. 24.23. <HI>Then shall the Moon be Confounded, and the Sun Ashamed.</HI> Another Late Writer Expresseth himself thus; <HI>What sight more Glorious, than to be|hold so many Saints, Like so many Suns to Shine with incomparable Lustre! A Saint in Heaven carries with him, a Light equal to that of the Sun Seven times doubled. The</HI> Souls <HI>of the Blessed, shall not only be</HI> Glo|rious; <HI>but their very</HI> Bodies <HI>shall be filled with</HI> Glory, <HI>&amp; invested with a Light Seven times Brighter than that of the Sun: For altho' it be said in the</HI> Gospel, <HI>that the Just shall shine as the Sun,</HI> Isaiah the Pro|phet
<PB N="144" REF="039533_0077_10142C0071995B70">
<HI>says, that the Sun in those Days shall shine seven times more than now it doth</HI> Men are apt to think, that these are only the <HI>Hyperbolical Expressions</HI> of some <HI>Divines:</HI> But why should they think so; when the Scripture says, that the Lord JESUS CHRIST shall change our Body, that it may be Fashioned <HI>Like unto His Glori|ous Body?</HI> There is no Glory which Eyes can behold, comparable to the Glorious Body of JESUS CHRIST; Since the Ful|ness of the Godhead <HI>dwells</HI> in Him Bodi|ly, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.9.

Whilest in this World, the Bodies of Gods Children as well as of other men, are sub|ject to manifold weaknesses &amp; infirmities. How many hundreds of diseases do Phy|sicians tell us that the body is subject un|to? But the Resurrection body shall not be subject to any disease, nor to any grief or pain. God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, <HI>Neither shall there be any more pain,</HI> for the former things are passed away, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.4. Nor can it easily be i|magined how great the Strength of this now weak body shall then be.

Their Strength will be won|derful. And that which adds to the won|der, is, that this Strength will never decay with Age.

<P N="4">(4) The Resurrection body will be a <HI>Spiritual</HI> body. 1 Cor. 15.44&punc; <HI>It is sown a Natural body, it is raised a Spiritual body.</HI> This is a Marvellous Expression. <HI>Luther</HI> says of it, <HI>Est sermo plane inauditus.</HI> Since <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> are of quite differing Na|tures, a <HI>Spiritual body</HI> is a wonderful body.

Meat and Drink agree with the Natural body, and that body is for them: but it is otherwise with the Spiritual body. It is said, <HI>Meat is for the belly, and the belly for Meats, but God shall destroy both it and them,</HI> 1 Cor. 6.13. <HI>The belly,</HI> i. e. the Stomach craves for Meat, and God has made &amp; appointed Meats suitable for the Natural Appetites of the body, but the Resurrection body is not for Meats, nor Meat for it. The <HI>Spiritual body</HI> will have no need, nor desire of Meat or Drink. It shall never hunger or thirst. One of our English Martyrs, a faithful Minister (his Name was <HI>Robert Samuel</HI>) after the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> (bloody <HI>Bonner</HI>) caused him to be cast into Prison, he there suffered much by hunger and thirst; The night before his Death, an Angel appeared to him in his sleep, saying, Be of good comfort <HI>Samuel,</HI> for after this day thou shalt never suffer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unger any more: Nor did he, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> day he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s <HI>Martyred</HI> Thus in the <HI>Re|surrection</HI>

World, the Children of God shall not be <HI>Subject</HI> to hunger or thirst, nor to any other of those infirmities which the <HI>Natural body</HI> is subject unto. Rev. 7.16. <HI>They shall hunger no more, nor thirst any more.</HI> The <HI>Spiritual</HI> body will not need such things to preserve life as the Natural body does. Without th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se props to support Nature, to shore up the Earthly Tabernacle, it would soon fall to the ground. The Children of the Resurrection shall stand in no more need of Meat and Drink or Sleep, than the Angels of Heaven do.

So shall the raised Saints be <HI>as the Angels of Heaven,</HI> who can as easily ascend as descend. There is a Scripture which not only the old Jewish Interpreters, but Ju|dicious Christian Expositors, conceive, has respect to what the Children of God will be able to do after the Resurrection; It is that, Isa. 40.31. <HI>They shall mount up with wings as Eagles.</HI> And because their <HI>Bo|dies</HI> shall be <HI>Spiritual,</HI> they will be able to move with wonderful <HI>Agility</HI> &amp; <HI>Celerity.</HI> They shall in that respect also, be <HI>as the Angels of Heaven.</HI> An Angel goes from one place to another with the greatest swiftness.

Like as men who are in a sad Prison, had rather be always there and to endure their pre|sent Misery, than to be fetched out from thence only to be Condemn'd to a terri|ble Death and Executed. So it is the case here. The Souls of men who have dyed in their Sins are in a Prison, and so are their bodies too, the Grave is their Pri|son. At the universal Resurrection they must be bro't out of Prison Body &amp; Soul, to have a Sentence of Eternal death passed upon them, to be Doomed unto Ever|lasting fire: so that their Resurrection will be worse than none at all. The <HI>Chil|dren of God</HI> are properly <HI>the Children of the Resurrection.</HI> They only shall have a <HI>Re|surrection unto Life</HI>; others unto <HI>the se|cond Death.</HI> The Scripture speaks Em|phatically of the <HI>Resurrection of the Just,</HI> Luk. 14.14. The <HI>unjust</HI> shall not receive an <HI>happy reward.</HI> The Resurrection of Believers on Christ, proceeds from such Causes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> may not be affirmed of others.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="157" REF="039533_0083_10142C11588ABED0">1. It is because of the Covenant which they are in with God, that they are made partakers of an happy Resurrection. As for Unbelievers, although some of them pretending to Christianity may be Exter|nally in Covenant with God, they are not Internally and Really so, and therefore their Resurrection cannot be by vertue of that Covenant which they never had a Real Interest in: but Believers have. By this Argument Christ proved against the <HI>Sadduces,</HI> that there will be a Resurrection, as we see in the Verse following our Text before us, <HI>That the dead are raised Moses shewed in the bush, when he called the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, for he is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living.</HI> Those holy Patriarchs were Dead and in their Graves when God said to <HI>Moses, I am their God,</HI> I am in Covenant with them. That which is in Covenant with GOD shall Live Eternally, therefore so shall the bodies of his Children, which implies their Resur|rection. For the <HI>Covenant</HI> is made with the <HI>Person</HI> consisting of Body &amp; Soul, and
<PB N="158" REF="039533_0084_10142C1335F0C6E0">
not with the Soul only altho' principally. Hence the bodies of Believers and not their Souls only are the Subjects of the Seals of the <HI>Covenant.</HI> So concerning <HI>Baptism</HI> the first Seal of the New-Testa|ment, the body is the Subject of that Or|dinance. Believers have their body wash|ed with pure Water. The Lord sayes to the true Believer, as sure as thou hast been Baptized, so certain is it that thy body shall have a blessed Resurrection. He has therein Communion with Christ in respect of the benefits both of his Death and Re|surrection, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.3, 4. He shall as sure|ly be raised up at the Last Day to Eternal Life as Christ is risen. Moreover, Be|lievers do with their bodies <HI>Sacramentally,</HI> as well as with their Souls by <HI>Faith,</HI> feed upon Christ Exhibited in the <HI>Lord's Sup|per.</HI> That body which does with a be|lieving Soul Eat the <HI>Flesh</HI> and drink the <HI>Blood</HI> of Christ, shall have a Resurrection to Everlasting Life.

proceed from Gods Covenant with him. The Resurrection of the body to Eternal Life, is a special Promise contained in the Covenant, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.25.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Resurrection of Believers is Purchased for them by the <HI>Blood</HI> of Christ. We cannot say so of Unbelievers dying in their Sins. It is by the Death of Christ that we are Redeemed from the Curse of the Law, of which the death of the body is some part. Christ by shedding his <HI>blood</HI> did Merit his Own Resurrection. He was <HI>brought back again from the dead through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant,</HI> Heb. 13.20. The same is to be affirmed of Be|lievers, as we see in that Scripture to which the Text to the Hebrews has a respect, <HI>viz.</HI> Zech. 9.11, 12. <HI>By the blood of the Cove|nant I have sent forth thy Prisoners out of the pit. Turn ye Prisoners of hope.</HI> The <HI>Grave</HI> is a <HI>Prison,</HI> but the <HI>Blood</HI> of Christ has caused the Prison door to be opened, the bodies of Belivers which <HI>Rest</HI> there in <HI>Hope</HI> shall come out of that pit. All that Redemption which Believers shall be the Subject of, is M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rited by the <HI>Blood</HI> of
<PB N="160" REF="039533_0085_10142C15E7574618">
Christ. Rev. 5.9. <HI>Thou hast Redeemed us by thy Blood.</HI> The <HI>Resurrection</HI> of the body is part of that Redemption. The Scrip|ture speaks of the <HI>Redemption of the Body,</HI> Rom 8.23. The <HI>Bodies</HI> as well as the Souls of Believers are said to be <HI>bought,</HI> 1 Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 6 20 It is the <HI>Blood</HI> of Christ and nothing else that has bought them</P>
<P N="3">3. It is by vertue of the <HI>Resurrection</HI> of Christ that Believers obtain a blessed <HI>Re|surrection.</HI> Thus does the Apostle argue. 1 Cor. 15.12, 13. <HI>If Christ be Preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no Resurrection? If there be no Resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen.</HI> As sure as Christ is risen, Be|lievers on him shall rise. For he rose as a <HI>Publick Person</HI> Representing all the Elect of God. Verse 21, 22. <HI>Since by man came death, by Man came also the Resurrection of the Dead, for as in Adam all dy, so in Christ all shall be made alive.</HI> There are two roots from which Death and Life proceed, <HI>viz.</HI> Adam &amp; Christ. The first Adam, by reason of his being a Publick Person Representing all Mankind, has been
<PB N="161" REF="039533_0085_10142C15E7574618">
a root of death to all his Children. Christ <HI>the second Adam,</HI> Representing all the Children of God, has been a root of Life to them all. Because He Rose from the dead and Liveth for ever more, they shall do so too. This also may be denoted by that Expression of Christs being <HI>the first born from the Dead,</HI> Col 1.18. Under the Law, a Ransom was to be Paid for the First born, and then the rest of the Chil|dren were free, because the first born was a Publick Person, Representing all the Children of the Family. Thus, if Christ is Redeemed from the Power of the Grave, then so are all the Children of God in him. When Christ opened the Womb of the Grave and came forth, then all Believers were freed by vertue of the Ransom which HE had paid. Hence also, the Resur|rection of Christ is mentioned as a <HI>first fruits. Christ is risen from the Dead, and became the first fruits of them that slept,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.20. The first Fruits were Con|secrated, and by vertue of that Consecra|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion all the Corn on the ground was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anctified. Thus inasmuch as Christ is
<PB N="162" REF="039533_0086_10142C17986291A8">
Risen, all the dead Bodies of the Children of God, which are as so many grains of Corn sowen in the Ground, are consecra|ted and virtually Risen with Christ. And this also is peculiar to Believers.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is by vertue of their Union with Christ, that Believers obtain a blessed Re|surrection. As for Unbelievers they are not United to Christ, and therefore have not a Resurrection unto Life. He that has not the Son, has not Life. Christ and all true Believers, are One <HI>Mystical Body.</HI> The blessed Head of that Body has been victorious over Death, and triumph'd over the Grave. Therefore so shall all the Members which belong to that Head Because of that intimate Union which is between Christ and Believers, some Scrip|tures which speak of the Resurrection, are to be understood both of Christ and of his Church. Thus, Hos. 6.2. <HI>After two Days he will Revive us, in the third Day he will Raise us up, and we shall Live in his sight.</HI> The Words allude to the Resurrection o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Christ, yet are applied to the Church which is Risen with Christ their Head
<PB N="163" REF="039533_0086_10142C17986291A8">
Because Christ was Raised from the dead, Believers shall Live in his sight for ever. And thus also may we understand that Scripture; Isa. 26.19. <HI>Thy Dead body shall Live, together with my Dead body shall they arise. Awake and Sing, ye that sleep in the Dust.</HI> Christ says to the Believer, Thy dead body did Rise with Mine. When my dead Body rose out of the Grave, thine did so too. The Resurrection of my dead Body, was a pledge &amp; certain fore-runner of the Resurrection of thy dead Body.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Doctrine</HI> thus Confirmed, we may <HI>Infer</HI> several things for our Instructi|on in Righteousness.</P>
<P>Inf. I. <HI>All the Children of GOD are Infinitely beholden to the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> They are beholden to Him for the Resur|rection of their Bodies. The Apostles <HI>Preached through Jesus the Resurrection from the Dead,</HI> Act. 4.2. We had never had an happy Resurrection if it had not been <HI>through Jesus.</HI> And therefore not One that shall dy in a Christless Estate will
<PB N="164" REF="039533_0087_10142C1927889EE8">
have such a Resurrection. Christ has made Believers to be happier than Ever Adam in Paradise was. For the present they are under a better Covenant. The Covenant of Grace is better than the Co|venant of Works, and Established upon better Promises. It is through Jesus Christ, that we are concerned in that Co|venant, <HI>Isa.</HI> 42.6. There are heavenly blessings, and such a glorious Perfection of Happiness Promised to Believers on Christ, as we cannot say Adam had a Pro|mise of. That Heaven which is Promised to Believers, does incomparably Excel the Earthly Paradise which belonged to Adam, and in which he should have Lived happily with a Confluence of Earthly blessings, if he had not Sinned. And for the present, Believers appear before God in a more glorious Righteousness than Adam had before his fall. He had only a Righte|ousness of his Own, which was not the Righteousness of One that is God; when|as the <HI>Righteousness of God is upon all that believe,</HI> Rom. 3.22. The Righteousness of Christ is imputed to them, and that is
<PB N="165" REF="039533_0087_10142C1927889EE8">
the Righteousness of God. And when Believers shall become the Children of the Resurrection, they will be far more glori|ous than ever Adam was. He was made <HI>Lower than the Angels,</HI> and not <HI>Equal</HI> to them in his first and best Estate. But as for Believers, Christ has advanced them to an Equality with Angels in more re|spects than one, as we have shewed. Oh&punc; how are we beholden to Christ? Nay, in respect of him they are dignified above Angels. For <HI>He took not on him the Na|ture of Angels,</HI> but the Nature of Man He has assumed. The Believer is nearer akin to the Son of God, than any Angel in heaven is.</P>
<P>Inf. II. <HI>There is a respect due to the Dead Bodies of Gods Children.</HI> Since they shall be Raised out of their Graves to such Glory as has been shewed, there is cer|tainly a respect due to them. Altho' we may not worship their <HI>Reliques</HI> as Idola|trous Papists do, Nevertheless, it is a great iniquity to cast contempt upon them. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the

Death of his Saints. When their dead Bodies are turned to dust, it is <HI>Precious Dust.</HI> That Body which is United to Christ, and has been Redeemed by his <HI>Blood,</HI> Death does not separate from his Love. They then who manifest their contempt and hatred of such holy Bodies, have not the Love of Christ nor his Spirit in them. A decent Burial is a respect due to the Bodies of Dead Saints. To deny it to those who are the Children of God, is great Impiety; or not to suffer them to have that honourable Interment which is due to their Station. It is noted as a great wickedness in <HI>Jehojakim,</HI> that he would not permit the Prophet <HI>Urijah</HI> to be so honourably Buried as was proper and sui|table for a Prophet of God, but he <HI>Cast his Dead Body into the Graves of the common People.</HI> And it is Observable, that the Providence of God met with him, and re|taliated his impiety upon him. For not|withstanding he was a King, and the Son of a King, there was no Funeral Solemnity or Lamentation for him, but he was <HI>Burie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the Burial of an Ass, drawn and cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

they may be sure will bring them out of what ever Grave of Affliction, they may Ly Buried in for a time. There are Chil|dren of God who are Afflicted with Bo|dily Weaknesses and Infirmities; and it may be for a Long time. We read in the Gospel, of a Daughter of <HI>Abraham,</HI> who had been <HI>bowed Down with a spirit of Infir|mity Eighteen Years,</HI> Luk. 13.11. There will be no Bodily Infirmities to complain of in the Resurrection World. This also affords Comfort to the Children of God, against the Fear of Death. God said to <HI>Jacob, Be not afraid to go Down into</HI> E|gypt, <HI>I will surely bring thee up again,</HI> Gen. 46.3, 4. So He says to the Believer, Be not afraid to go down into the Grave, I will surely bring thee up again; and in the mean time, <HI>Thou shalt see Joseph,</HI> thy Soul shall be with <HI>IESUS.</HI> Therefore should they go into the Grave, not only Willingly but Chearfully. The tho'ts of their Death being near at hand, should be a Comfort to them. And it is moreover, a comfortable Meditation, for Believers who dy in these Last Ages of the world,
<PB N="178" REF="039533_0094_10142C2D90A258B8">
that they shall not continue Long in their Graves. It was a comfort to Christ, that altho' He knew he should Dy, He also knew that he should not abide Long in the state of Death: Isa. 50.8. <HI>He is near that Justifieth me</HI>; I shall not be Long in my Grave. Believers in the Latte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Days, have in this respect an Happiness above what they had in the Years of Ancient Ge|nerations. <HI>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Samuel</HI> and all the Prophets have been in their Graves, for more than Two Thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sand Years. Altho' we know not the pre|cise Time when it will be; Nevertheless, we have Scripture-ground to apprehend, that the <HI>Resurrection of the Just</HI> will be within far less Time than Two Thousand Years.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="question">
<HEAD>QUESTION.</HEAD>
<P>What shall we do, that so we may be Sure of a Blessed Resurrection?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Let us make Sure that our Souls be Risen out of a State of SIN. Are our Souls Quickned, which Once were Dead in Trespasses and Sins? If our Souls have Experienced a <HI>Spiritual Resurrection,</HI> our Bodies shall have a Blessed Resurrecti|on at the Last Day. Is there a Spiritual Life infused into our Souls? Is there a work of Saving Grace begun there? Have we truly Repented of all our Sins? Then they shall not Ly down with us in the Grave, and Rise up with us to Condemn us at the Great Day. Is there none in this Assembly, but what can say as in the Presence of GOD, I know not of any One
<PB N="184" REF="039533_0097_10142C340AA47CC0">
Sin I have been guilty of, but I have Con|fessed it, Repented of it; and through Christ my Peace is made with God? Are we true Believers on CHRIST? All and only such are Regenerate. Then there is a blessed Scripture for us to Meditate on, and take Comfort from: It is that, Joh. 11.25, 26. <HI>Jes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s said, I am the Re|surrection and the Life; he that Believeth on me, though he were Dead, yet shall he Live. And whosoever Liveth, and Believeth on me, shall never Die.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The way for us to Obtain a Blessed Resurrection of our Bodies, is to be always doing Good, and serving GOD whil'st we are in the Body. <HI>I have hope</HI> (says the Apostle) <HI>that there shall be a Resurrection of the Dead.</HI> And then he adds, <HI>Herein do I Exercise my self, to have always a Con|science Void of Offence toward God, and to|ward men,</HI> Act. 24.15, 16. When serious thoughts of the Resurrection, shall make a man diligent in Serving GOD, and in Endeavours to be Useful unto Men, that's
<PB N="185" REF="039533_0097_10142C340AA47CC0">
a sign of his being One that shall have a Blessed Resurrection. Then shall we receive a Reward according to what we have <HI>Done whilest in the Body.</HI> Works of Piety towards GOD, will then be Rewarded. Mat. 6.6. <HI>When thou Pray|est, enter into thy Closet, and when thou hast shut thy Door, Pray to thy Father which is in Secret, and thy Father which Seeth in Secret, shall Reward thee Openly.</HI> And when will Prayer and other Works of Piety, be Rewarded Openly? In the Re|surrection World, they shall be Rewarded Openly before the whole World. The like is to be said concerning Acts of Cha|rity towards Men, they shall be <HI>Recom|pensed at the Resurrection of the Just,</HI> Luk. 14.14. And therefore the more Good we have done in the World, the greater will the Recompence of Reward then be; the Thought whereof should Encourage us to be very Laborious in Serving the LORD. Wherefore the A|postle, after he had Discoursed Largely concerning the Resurrection of the Chil|dren
<PB N="186" REF="039533_0098_10142C36C3241B90">
of GOD, makes this Conclusion; <HI>Be ye always Abounding in the Work of the Lord, for as much as ye know, that your Labour is not in Vain in the Lord,</HI> 1 Corinth. 15.58. In the Resurrection World, when you shall be as the An|gels of Heaven, you will certainly know and see, that <HI>your Labour has not been i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Vain in the Lord.</HI></P>

There are three Graces in which Christianity does Eminently consist, viz. <HI>Faith, Love, and Hope</HI>; of all which the Apostle speaks in this with the preceding Verse.

God himself has Opened the Prison-door, and he is gone forth; we may therefore hope, yea, we may rest assured of it, that our Debt is fully Paid.

<HI>Rome,</HI> have been accounted the greatest Cities that ever the Sun saw. Yet nei|ther of them were above Fifty Miles in Compass.

the heaven of heavens is of a much Vaster Extent.

<P N="4">4. There are Admirable Properties of this Heaven, by which we may see how Desirable a Place it is. Blessed Proper|ties which cannot be said of this Sinful Earth. And what are they?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> (1.) A Blessed <HI>Purity</HI> is to be Affirmed of that Heaven in which the
<PB N="220" REF="039533_0115_10142C5D87EC1380">
Believers hope is laid up. It is true that as to the Matter of it, it is a Pure Sub|stance. The Purest Gold, the Richest Gems are not to Compare with it; nor is any Earthly thing: But it is a Place of the Greatest Purity on an higher Account, than that of the Matter out of which it does Consist. For it was never Defiled with any Sin; and is therefore called <HI>an Inheritance Undefiled,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.4 It is an <HI>holy heaven.</HI> Psal. 20.6. <HI>He will hear from his</HI> holy <HI>heaven; with the saving strength of his right hand.</HI> How should there be Sin there, when there is such a Glorious Presence of God in it? There never was, there never shall be any Sin there. <HI>There shall in no wise enter into it any thing that Defiles,</HI> Rev. 21.27. Then I am sure that Sin cannot enter into it, for that is the defilingest thing that ever was. This Earth was a far more desira|ble place before Sin entred into it, and brought a Blemish and a Curse upon it, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow it is They that have an earnest desire to be perfectly pure and holy&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ong to be in heaven&punc;

For there they will find that Purity which their Souls breathe after. The <HI>holy of holies</HI> in the Temple, was a Type of the <HI>heaven of heavens.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) Another Property of this heaven is, the <HI>Constancy</HI> of its Nature. It was not made out of Pre-existent Principles, as all things that shall Perish and be sub|ject to Change were. It was made out of Nothing, as soon as ever the Work of Creation began, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.1. It was made before the Starry heaven, and before the Earth, which was Created the day before the Sun Moon and Stars were made. For Angels are the Inhabitants of it; and they shouted when they saw God lay the Foun|dations of the Earth, <HI>Job</HI> 38.6, 7. It re|mains the same that it was the first Day that the World began, without any alte|ration; and will do so to all Eternity. It is therefore called an Inheritance which is <HI>Incorruptible,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.4. In this world, all things are subject to Change: Here is not our Rest. It is not a Place to conti|nue in: But heaven is; Heb. 13.14. <HI>Here we have no continuing City, but we seek one

to come.</HI> Our Days on Earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding. But in heaven there are <HI>Mansions,</HI> which are <HI>Ever|lasting habitations,</HI> Luk. 16.9. It is the greatest Folly in the world, for men to think that their houses on Earth shall be continued for Ever; and their dwelling places to all Generations: But Heaven is an eternal house: 2 Cor. 5.1. <HI>We have a building of God, not made with hands, eter|nal in the heavens.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) Another Property of this heaven is, a wonderful <HI>Splendor.</HI> A marvellous Clarity and Brightness beyond what is in the most Resplendent Gems. It is called <HI>a Throne of Sapphire-stone,</HI> which shines with a great Brightness, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 1.26.

not for its heat, but for its light. Hence also resembl'd to a <HI>Jasper</HI> Stone, Rev. 21.11.

thus do Hypocrites.

The Great <HI>Congrega|tion of the Righteous,</HI> the General Assem|bly and Church of the First-born will be there, maintaining a Blessed and Sinless Communion, and declaring the great things which God has done for them. There is very little spoken in the Scrip|ture, concerning the Providences of God towards the Long-liv'd <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> who Liv'd before the Flood. Without doubt, they had marvellous Experiences of the Goodness of God, and his wonderful Works towards them. It is the Observa|tion of an Eminent Divine, that the Story of those things is reserved for Heaven; and there they will have time enough to De|clare them; and to Praise the Lord in the Great Congregation. And it is hence E|vident, that the Saints in Heaven shall Know one another: Otherwise there would be little comfort in their Communi|on. They who are Strangers to one ano|ther,

When a Faithful Minister of Christ shall come to heaven, the Souls there who have been Converted or Edi|fied by his Ministry, will greatly Rejoyce to see him.

their Pictures; for the <HI>Jews</HI> did not allow of, nor had they any such Pictures among them. But there was a Divine Irradiati|on on his Mind, causing him to know who they were.

<P N="2">2. In Heaven there is an innumerable Company of Angels, with whom we shall there have a Blessed Communion. There

is Joy in Heaven, Joy among the Angels of God over a sinner that Repents, <HI>Luk.</HI> 15.10. Then certainly the Angels Re|joyce, when they see a Soul come to Hea|ven to joyn with them in Glorifying God there. It is true, that whilest we are in this World, we have a Communion with Angels, more than we know or think of; for it is secret and invisible. As long as we abide in a state of Mortality, the Pre|sence of an Angel is awful and terrible to us. An Angel appear'd to <HI>Samson</HI>'s Mo|ther: She knew him not to be an Angel, if she had, she would have been more terrify'd; but she said to her Husband, <HI>A man of God came to me, and his Countenance was like the Countenance of an Angel of God, very terrible,</HI> Judg. 13.6.

Christ will speak nothing to his Saints in Heaven, but what shall be Kind and Comfortable. When he was Trans|figured, there appeared Glorify'd men <HI>talking with him,</HI> Luk. 9.30. What Com|munications there are and shall be, be|tween Christ and the Glorified, We know not; nor shall we until we are among them. But we know, that they have a Blessed Fellowship with the Son of God in Heaven; and that a very great part o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

their Happiness does consist in that Com|munion. It is Heaven to be with Christ. The happiness of heaven is thus Expressed by our Saviour himself; Joh. 17.24. <HI>Fa|ther, I will that they whom thou hast Given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my Glory.</HI> The Humane Nature of Christ, in which dwells the Fulness of the Godhead Bodily, is as full of God as it is possible for a Creature to be. There is more of God to be seen in that Man, than in all the Creatures in Heaven or Earth. <HI>The Man Christ Jesus,</HI> is the most Glorious Object that Eyes can behold. It is Christ's being there, that makes Heaven to be Heaven indeed. Believers who Dy'd un|der the Old Testament were in a blessed Estate, Nevertheless, when the Man Christ Jesus Ascended to <HI>Heaven,</HI> his coming there was a great Addition to their hap|piness. His Presence filled heaven with a New Glory, beyond what Glorify'd Souls had seen before that Day. It is Christ's being there, that makes heaven to be so desirable. The Apostle therefore said, <HI>I desire to depart, and to be with Christ,</HI>

Phil. 1.23. He does not say, I desire to depart that I may be in Heaven; but that I may be with Christ. To be with Christ is better than to be in Heaven without Him.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>The Perfection of Blessedness con|sists in Seeing</HI> GOD. It is so Expressed in the Scripture, Heb. 12.14. <HI>Follow Ho|liness, without which no man shall see the Lord.</HI> All the Blessedness of Heaven is denoted by that, of <HI>Seeing the Lord.</HI> The Glorify'd have a clear and immediate Sight of GOD. They do not see him through the Glass of his Word &amp; Works as is in this World they do; but have an Open, Clear, Full Sight of him; 1 Cor. 13.12. <HI>Now we see through a Glass Dark|ly; but then Face to Face: Now I know in part, but then shall I know even as I am known.</HI> Here we have but a Dark and Very Imperfect Knowledge of God. Both the Object and our Eyes are covered with Darkness; but in heaven that Darkness is Removed, so that we see clearly; as two men who are near together &amp; behold one

another Face to Face. In this Life, our sight of God is by Faith: <HI>We Walk by Faith, and not by Sight</HI>; But in heaven there is an immediate Vision and Fruition of him. Not that in heaven God the Fa|ther is seen with Bodily Eyes. The Di|vine Nature cannot be seen: He is the <HI>In|visible God,</HI> whom no man has seen nor can see, as to a Corporeal Vision. But <HI>Mental Knowledge</HI> is in the Scripture Ex|pressed by <HI>Vision.</HI> It is an Intellectual Vision of GOD which Saints in Glory are Blessed with: He is <HI>seen with the Eye of the Understanding.</HI> Not that the Blessed have a <HI>Comprehensive Vision</HI> or <HI>Knowledge</HI> of GOD. No Creature can Comprehend the Incomprehensible Being of GOD. Finite has no proportion to In|finite. Therefore no Finite Understand|ing can have a Perfect Knowledge of the Infinite Being: Job 11.7. <HI>Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty to Perfection</HI>? No Creature can ever do it. Nevertheless, there is an <HI>Intellectual Knowledge</HI> of God, in which the <HI>Essence</HI> of Happiness does consist:

<P N="1">1. From his Free Infinite Love. He is Rich in Mercy, and because of his <HI>Great Love,</HI> we hope for Mercy unto Eternal Life. The Love of GOD is like Himself. Yea, it is Himself.

<Q>You think by what you say to Comfort me: But you make my heart Sad. It is as if you should tell one that has been sore Weather-beaten at Sea, and hoped that he was come to the End of his Wearisome Voyage, that he must go back again.</Q>
Mr. <HI>Edward Deering,</HI> said to his Friends, <HI>If I were put to my Choice, whether I would Dy or Live, if it may stand with the holy Will of God, I would a Thou|sand times rather Chuse to Dy &amp; go to Hea|ven, than to Continue Longer in this Evil World.</HI> The Servants of God have at pre|sent the more Reason to be willing to Dy, for that the <HI>Days are Evil</HI>; and they are like to be worse.

So must Believers afore they are gathered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto the heavenly barn. Now growth in Grace ripens for Heaven.

a field which grow until they dye. We should therefore be diligent in improving Means of Grace in order unto growth&punc; The Word of God is appointed as the In|strument, not only to begin a work of Grace but to increase it. 1 Pet. 2.2. <HI>De|sire the sincere Milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby.</HI> And the Lord does often proportion measures of Grace, ac|cording to Mens diligence in attending to his Word. Tis said, <HI>Take heed how you hear; for to him that has, shall be given.</HI> Luk. 8.18. They that have the Grace to make a due improvement of their hearing the Word, shall have more Grace given to them. The <HI>Lords Supper</HI> is instituted, not to begin but to strengthen the work of Grace where it is begun. And when Be|lievers draw nigh unto God in that holy Ordinance, with due Preparation for it, they will surely grow in Grace thereby. For in that Ordinance in a special manner, they <HI>Behold as in a glass the Glory of the Lord, and are changed into the same image from Glory to Glory,</HI> i. e. from one degree of Grace unto another, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.18. So

will they in due time appear to be Vessels of Mercy prepared unto Glory.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us be Fruitful in Good Works.</HI> Growing in Grace, &amp; Abounding in Good Works is making hast to Heaven. When men remove from one Place to another, they use to send their Goods before them. It has been well observed by a Pious Di|vine, that when Jacob returned to his own Country, he sent his droves before him, and he followed after. Thus should we send droves of Duties &amp; Good Works both of Piety and Charity to go before us to the heavenly Country, which if we are true Believers on Christ, is our own Country, and we shall e're long follow. By this we lay up for our selves Treasure in Heaven. Let us then do all the Good we can whilest we are on the Earth. And there will be a double blessed consequent of it, One is that we shall be the sooner in Heaven. For if we make hast in doing Good Works, the sooner shall we come to the End of our Works, and then we shall be in Heaven, whither our Works as to
<PB N="272" REF="039533_0141_10142CA02FA65188">
the blessed reward of them will follow us. Blessed are the Dead which dye in the Lord, they cease from their Labours and their Works follow them. Our Saviour Christ said to God, <HI>I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do: and now, O Fa|ther, glorify me with thy self,</HI> Joh. 17, 4, 5. So when the Believer has finished his work, he shall be glorifyed in Heaven, and if he abounds therein, he will soon have finished it. And then another Con|sequent is, that the greater will the Glory be when we shall come there. For Christ has said, That He will give to every Man according as his Work shall be. By a|bounding in Good Works, we Obtain a Bill of Exchange for <HI>Heaven,</HI> which will be accepted by the Faithful and Glorious Pay Master. 1 Tim. 6.18, 19. <HI>Be rich in good Works, laying up in Store for themselves a Good Foundation,</HI> (a sure Bill of Ex|change is a good foundation) <HI>against the time to come, that they may lay hold on Eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="273" REF="039533_0141_10142CA02FA65188">3. <HI>Let our Care be, that if Death come upon us Suddenly, we may have nothing to do, but to Dy and go to Heaven.</HI> No man in the world knows, but that he may be taken away by a Sudden Death. So it has been oft-times, not only with Ungod|ly men; but with Saints of God, and E|minent Ones too. Yea, some of them have with an humble Submission to the Will of God, Desired and Prayed for such a Death. To be sure, there is no Rule in the Scripture to Pray against it; as some do. It is surely a great Favour of God, to have a Quick and an Easie Passage into his Heavenly Kingdom. Our Care and Endeavour should then be, that if the Lord should Call for us Suddenly, we may be Ready to go at the first Call: That when he shall send the Messenger of Death for us, we may be Ready to go at the <HI>first Knock:</HI> Luk. 12.35, 36. <HI>Let your Loi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s be Girded about</HI>; so it is with men that are ready to go: <HI>And you your selves like unto men that Wait for their Lord&punc; that when he Comes and Knocks&punc; they may

Open to him immediately.</HI> It's a sad thing when Death comes Suddenly, for a man to think, There is such a thing, and such a thing, which if I had thought I should have Died, I would have done; but it has been neglected, and now I am uncapable of performing it. It is therefore a Duty and good Prudence, for a man always to have a Testamentary Disposal of his Worldly Estate in Readiness by him; lest a Sudden Death should make him Dye Intestate; which it may be he would be loth to do. The Prophet said to <HI>Heze|kiah, Set thine House in Order</HI>: i. e. Make thy Will; <HI>for thou shalt Dye,</HI> Isa. 38.1. The neglect of this Duty has been an O|mission, which many Good men have been found Faulty in; and which has occa|sioned a great deal of Trouble and Con|fusion in their Families, when they have been gone out of the World. But especi|ally, and above all; our Care should be to set our Souls in Order; that nothing is left Undone in matters wherein our Souls are Concerned: That if Death should come Suddenly, there may not be a Cry

as with some it has been, <HI>My Time is done, but my Work is not done, nor well begun nei|ther.</HI> Let us be able to say, My Peace is made with God, I am in Christ; I know not of any one Sin that ever I was guilty of in my Life, but I have Unfeignedly Repented of it. Then welcome Death, welcome Heaven.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>If we would be in a Readiness for Hea|ven, our Care should be to Walk Closely with GOD.</HI> Let us beware of Blotting our E|vidences for Heaven, by giving way to Temptation <HI>at any Time</HI>: Luk. 21.34. <HI>Take heed to your selves,</HI> lest at any Time, <HI>your Hearts be Overcharged with Surfeit|ing, and Drunkenness, and Cares of this Life.</HI> A Christian should <HI>Live every Day as if it were his Last Day:</HI> The meaning of which is not, that he should do just those things, &amp; none other than what he would do, if he knew he should Dy the next Day: But he should be as Careful not to Mispend his Time, and not to Commit any Sin against God; or Delay the Perform|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng of any Known Duty, as he would be

if he were this Day to give his Account to God, what he has done, and how he spent his Days on Earth. We should Live in a continual Expectation of our being called out of This, into the Eternal World. So did <HI>Job; All the Days of my Appointed Time, will I wait until my Change shall come.</HI> We shall soon be gone out of this Evil World; we know not how soon: The sooner the better, if so be the Will of GOD. In the mean time, we should Live Watching, and Waiting, and Praying, and Seeking, and Hoping: <HI>For here have we no Continuing City; but we Seek One to Come.</HI> Our Souls within us should say, <HI>Come Lord Jesus, Come Quickly.</HI> Come and Receive us to thy Self; that where thou art we may be also, in the Mansions which thou hast Prepared for us, in thy Father's House. <HI>Amen,</HI> LORD JESUS, <HI>Even so be it, Come Quickly.</HI></P>
