<P><HI>A Few Instances of some late awful Providences.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Earth-quakes.</HI> About two years ago <HI>viz. Ian.</HI> 26, <HI>&amp;</HI> 28&middot; 1662, 63. The founda|tions of the Earth trembled, and some of our houses rock't like a cradle. 6, or 7 times did the Earth shake under us in the space of 2 or 3 dayes. It was then thought and said, that these <HI>Earth-quakes</HI> might portend the Lords shaking the foundations of our Churches and of our civil state.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="20" REF="000099_0022_0FA02818651E51C0" MS="y">2. The late <HI>removal by Death</HI> of some of our eminent <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>seers,</HI> who were as eyes unto us in the Wilderness, and the <HI>Charets</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> and the <HI>Horse-men</HI> thereof. <HI>April.</HI> 5<HI>th,</HI> 1663, That burning and shining Light, who shone in the Church of <HI>Boston,</HI> and gave light to the whole Colony and Country. Mr. <HI>John Norton,</HI> a man eminently accomplished, was taken from us, and translated to an higher Orb. Of whom <HI>New-England</HI> was not worthy.</P>
<P><HI>Iuly</HI> 20 1663. That bright and radiant Star, a Star of the first magnitude, Mr. <HI>Samuel Stone,</HI> the strength and glory of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> rested from his labours and sorrows, and fell a sleep sweetly and placidly in the Lord. A little before Him, Mr <HI>Iohn Miller</HI> and Mr. <HI>Samuel Newman,</HI> faithful, painful and affectionate Preachers of the Gospel, were also taken from us by death. Thus our Pillars are cut down, our strongest Stakes pluck't up, and our breaches not repaired. Is it a small thing in our eyes, y^t our principal Congregations &amp; Head-townes, should be so sadly bereaved, as they are at this day?</P>
<P N="3">3. The sad <HI>Mildew</HI> and <HI>Blasting,</HI> where|by we have been greatly afflicted the last Sum|mer, and some of us the Summer before: our prin|cipal grain being turned into an husk &amp; rotteness.</P>

<P N="1">1. What a jealous eye the Lord hath upon us, observing how we carry and behave our selves at such a time as this&punc; <HI>Ier.</HI> 3.8.

<P N="2">2. What the Lord expects and looks for from a people so highly favoured and priviledged, and so awfully warned and threatned. <HI>Zeph.</HI> 3.7. I said surely thou wilt fear mee; thou wilt receive Instruction: so their dwelling place should not be cut off; howsoever I puni|shed them.</P>
<P N="3">3. How sadly will the Lord Jesus expostulate with us, if we fall asleep in the hour of the Passion and Agony of the Gospel. <HI>Mat.</HI> 26.40. He cometh unto the Disciples and findeth them a sleep, and saith unto <HI>Peter,</HI> what could ye not watch with me one hour? each word is very Emphatical.</P>
<P N="4">4. The danger of being surprized by temp|tation before we are aware. <HI>Lam.</HI> 1.9. She
