<HEAD>TO Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Oliver</HI> the Relict, AND TO Mr. ANDREW and Mr. PETER OLIVER the Children Of the <HI>Deceased.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Bodily Weakness not allowing Your Presence at the Funeral <HI>Lecture,</HI> Prevented me from Offer|ing You a Word of <HI>Comfort</HI> There, and makes it requisite that I shou'd preface the following Sermon with it.</P>
<P>When this whole Town and Country are Lamenting their Great Loss of YOUR CONSORT; How heavy must the Weight of Grief descend on the Heart of ONE, to whom He was the nearest of all Others? <HI>Your Friends</HI> are sensible that the chief of Your Earthly Comforts is gone from Your House for Ever; and such a Comfort as we readily own is not in Creatures to be Repaired: And <HI>They</HI> also Feel the Loss, and Mourn with You.</P>
<P>But O MADAM! Must Your Sorrow swallow up Your GRA|TITUDE for the Past and Present Bounties of Heaven, and Your FAITH in Those that are set before You? May the melan|cholly Passion weigh down the Consolations of the Everlasting COVENANT? Or may we think our Greatest Comfort is fled a|way, while the All-sufficient GOD remains to solace and make Us Happy.</P>
<P><PB REF="003597_0004_0FF834819F32FBF8">You have not Lost so much in Creatures as You are owing to the Divine Goodness for Lending to You. You have many still continued, and some of no ordinary Value, of which I might name Your Children, and for which You know You have Reason to be exceeding THANKFUL. But the <HI>Happiness</HI> set be|fore You is infinitely Greater than any You have yet Enjoyed: and FAITH will give You such a View, as to make all things Here <HI>Possessed</HI> appear as nothing to Those in <HI>Prospect.</HI> The Ever|lasting COVENANT is ordered in all things <HI>Well</HI> by GOD Him|self, that it can never be Mended; and by Him is made so <HI>Sure,</HI> that it can never be Broken. Therein is a boundless Treasure of exceeding Great and Precious Promises. And in the Blessed GOD there is an infinite Source of Good; and a Source Open through CHRIST, and ever Free to Flow, to supply all our Wants, and answer our most enlarged Desires.</P>
<P>Let Your GRATITUDE for Present &amp; Past Enjoyments there|fore moderate your Grief for Those You have Lost, or rather Parted with for a little Season; especially since this Greatest and Last of all has been continued so long to You: And let Your FAITH in the <HI>Heavenly</HI> World, raise up your Mind above the Sorrows of <HI>This</HI> and the Occasions of them. Let the Well-ordered COVENANT and the Promises therein, be Your constant Meditation; and they will quickly send you Streams of Comfort. And as GOD is the Greatest Good Promis'd in it; Let <HI>Him,</HI> es|pecially as He appears in CHRIST, be the chief Object of your Tho'ts and Desires; and He will soon be your chief and satis|fying Delight and Joy: He will be a Fountain of Life to You, while the Shadows of Death are stretched over You; He'll turn the Darkness of Your Bereavement into the Light of his Coun|tenance; and He'll make You Drink of the River of His Plea|sure.</P>
<P>These, MADAM, are the Desires and Hopes of <HI>Many</HI> for You, and no doubt the availing Prayers on File of <HI>Them</HI> that are gone before You.</P>
<P><PB REF="003597_0005_0FF8348395E47E00" MS="y">And as for THE SURVIVING OFFSPRING &mdash; I have only to Recommend the Lovely <HI>Examples</HI> of Your FATHER and BROTHER; in Part exhibited in the following Pages, but which Your own Memories will more perfectly represent than any Pen can describe.</P>
<P>In the second Sermon indeed, I have not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> men|tioned Your BROTHER, nor so much as lisped the <HI>Occasion</HI> of my Preaching it. The Reason of which was my Caution of Of|fending the Humble Ear of His FATHER then Present: Though every Hearer could not help applying almost every Passage to the Deceased and Beloved <HI>Youth,</HI> whose Loss we were then Deploring. And because it was so Applicable; His FATHER, tho' urged by several, was not willing to encourage its Pub|lication.</P>
<P>At <HI>Your</HI> united Desire, that Second Sermon appears now with the First: And as their <HI>Subjects</HI> were so nearly Related and so Dear to Each other, and are now doubtless met and triumphing together in the World <HI>Above</HI>; It seems Fitting They should be Remembred together in <HI>This</HI> Below: And Your <HI>Desire</HI> of the same I take, not only as an Instance of Filial and Fraternal <HI>Affection,</HI> but as a Token of Your <HI>Resolution</HI> to Follow their Patterns.</P>
<P>And Here, I cannot Forbear supplying a material <HI>Omission</HI> I made in the Historical Part of Your FATHER'S Character; which was, <HI>His Devoting the</HI> TENTH <HI>of his Incomes to Pious and Charita|ble Uses.</HI> I have been inform'd by an intimate Friend of His, that once upon Occasion He said; Tho' he had a <HI>Thousand</HI> Pounds come in that Year, He accounted <HI>One Hundred</HI> of them not his Own, but immediately Due to GOD and the <HI>Poor</HI>! And I am inform'd by another; that he made so much Conscience of this, that as he was often uncertain of the <HI>Sum</HI> of his Gains, He would, rather <HI>Exceed</HI> what he thought a <HI>Tenth</HI> than fall below it, least He should fail of his Duty. And Your Elder BROTHER Be|gan to be noted for <HI>Charity</HI> before He Left us.</P>
<P><PB REF="003597_0006_0FF834854A331968">I doubt not but You have <HI>Chosen</HI> the GOD of Your <HI>Fathers</HI> for <HI>Yours,</HI> and are Resolved by his Help to <HI>Exalt</HI> Him. And as Your <HI>Father's</HI> Friends, who are also <HI>Yours,</HI> are Pleased with the Prospect of <HI>This</HI>; They heartily wish You Life and Prospe|rity, with Grace to improve them to as eminent a Measure as <HI>He.</HI> &mdash;</P>

<P>Well done! <HI>GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT</HI>! &mdash; Enter Thou into <HI>THE JOY</HI> of thy LORD!</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is the happy <HI>Sentence</HI> CHRIST pronounces on his <HI>Faithful Servants,</HI> at the End of their present State of Service and Probation.</P>
<P>In the preceeding Context, He represents Him|self as a MASTER <HI>of an Houshold</HI> travelling into a far Country. He distributes to his several Servants various Talents, according to his sovereign Plea|sure, to manage and improve till He comes and reckons with them. At length He appears and calls them to a strict account: He condemns and orders the <HI>Slothful</HI> into outer Darkness; but the <HI>Good and Faithful</HI> He commends and takes into the Joys of his House and Presence.</P>
<P>This <HI>Parable,</HI> methinks, is one of the most im|portant and sublime in the inspired Writings, tho' deliver'd in the plainest Language. For nothing sure can give us a more noble, just and extensive
<PB N="2" REF="003597_0008_0FF83489B141DD00">
View of the <HI>great Design and Business</HI> of our present Scituation in this lower World. Representing us as in a state of <HI>Service</HI> to the SON OF GOD, who is also LORD, <HI>of the whole Creation</HI>; as receiving all our Powers and Interests from Him; as being betrusted with them as so many Talents to be im|proved for Him; as being accountable to Him, who in his Humane Nature is gone to Heaven, but will one Day come and call us to a strict Account, and assign our Recompence; condemn &amp; send the <HI>unprofitable</HI> to the infernal Prison, but approve and bid the <HI>Faithful</HI> welcome to the Joys of Paradise.</P>
<P>What more grand Idea can be form'd of the main Design of the present State? being to serve the LORD <HI>of the World,</HI> in our Pursuits and Views, and to contrive and act with a superior and extended Prospect into <HI>Eternity.</HI> Such exalted Sentiments as these are inspir'd in this plain Parable. How inconceivably mean are all the Passages of the wi|sest Philosophers in comparison with it? And I have often tho't it a Property peculiar to <HI>that Hu|mane nature</HI> inhabited by the SON OF GOD, to represent the Greatest things in the most familiar Language.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Text</HI> is the joyful <HI>Sentence</HI> pronounced on the <HI>Faithful</HI> only. And the Illustration of it I shall now by Divine Assistance, endeavour under these Three General Heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. Consider the Property, Life and CHARACTER of the Person here described, &mdash; a <HI>Good and Faithful Servant.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The glorious APPROBATION CHRIST here expresses of and to Him, at the Period of his present Service &mdash;<HI>Well Done! Good and Faithful Servant!</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="3" REF="003597_0009_0FF8348BAB0FBA38">3. and Lastly, Take a distant, but as clear a Prospect as we are able now to form, of THE JOY OF HIS LORD, which this Faithful Servant is now welcomed into.</P>
<P N="1">I. Consider the Property, Life and CHARACTER of the Person here described &mdash; a <HI>Good and Faith|ful Servant.</HI></P>
<P>And here are these two things,</P>
<P N="1">1. The singular RELATION He stands in to his Lord &mdash; a <HI>Servant.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. His happy DISCHARGE of the comprehensive Duty of this Relation &mdash; a <HI>Good and Faithful Servant.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The singular RELATION He stands in to his Lord, &mdash; a <HI>Servant.</HI></P>
<P>i. e. a <HI>Servant</HI> to CHRIST is his primary and essential Character. He is in a state of Service to this LORD <HI>of Men and Angels,</HI> by a vast variety of <HI>Obligations.</HI></P>
<P>He was created by the SON OF GOD and for Him, and so produced in a state of Service and Subjection to Him. He was form'd at first with Powers to know his Lord, to discern his Autho|rity, to understand his Will, and to yield a volun|tary Obedience to Him. He was born in the Do|minion and under the Law of this supream LORD <HI>of Heaven and Earth.</HI> He depends intirely upon Him, receives all the Means of his Subsistence from Him, and is supported by his continual Influence. By Him appointed and stated in his Place &amp; Work, and by Him endow'd and intrusted with all his Talents. From Him he receives Commands, which are Holy, Just and Good: and is on the one hand allur'd to obey them by most gracious Promises;
<PB N="4" REF="003597_0010_0FF8348DD229B050">
and on the other, deterr'd from Disobedience by most terrible Threatnings. He has indeed rebell'd, has rebellious Principles subsisting in Him, and is by nature subject to the Execution of those dread|ful Threatnings: But this LORD <HI>of Life and Glory</HI> has first amazingly stoop'd to Dye for his Redemp|tion, and then to invite and urge Him to re-submit and again enjoy the Privilege of his House and Family. In short, He is constantly receiving a vast variety and number of undeserved Favours from Him, and is offer'd innumerable others both for Time and for Eternity. And He is abundant|ly convinc'd of all these things.</P>
<P>Nor is this the Half of his peculiar Character. &mdash; There is a new Creation accomplish'd on Him, a new Formation wro't within Him: a Day of mighty Power has come upon his Soul, inform'd his Judg|ment, remov'd his Prejudice, chang'd his Inclina|tion, overcome his Will: In short, has bro't Him to an affecting Sight &amp; Sense of his sinful and mi|serable State, to a bitter Sorrow for all his Sins and Follies, and to an hearty Willingness and Resolu|tion to Forsake them, and to Return and Re-sub|mit Himself to this KING <HI>of Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Now he hears the inviting Voice of CHRIST, He melts, He abhors Himself, He mourns, He is encouraged, He rises, He makes haste: And now the Language of his Heart is this &mdash;
<Q>O <HI>most Glorious</HI> LORD! Other Lords have had Dominion over me, and they have rul'd like cruel and ma|licious Tyrants: They shall never rule me more: I renounce them all for ever, and I return to Thee! I see the Happiness of serving Thee: I gladly embrace thy Offer: I freely and wholly yield my self to Thee. O <HI>most merciful &amp; mighty</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="003597_0011_0FF8348FCA923510">
REDEEMER! I cast myself upon Thee! Accept, Forgive, Possess, Rule and Save me! Write thy Law in this Heart of mine, and put thy SPIRIT in me! Inspire me with Love and Zeal: and by thy Grace assisting, I will improve all my Talents for Thee, I will obey all thy Laws, and I will serve Thee faithfully for ever.</Q></P>
<P>This is the happy <HI>Change</HI> and <HI>Byass,</HI> wherewith He enters the Service of this great LORD, and Be|gins to serve Him with Freedom and Sincerity.</P>
<P>But of such a one we have it represented further, that He proves a <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> Servant. We therefore now proceed to the other Part of his Character, viz.</P>
<P N="2">2. His happy DISCHARGE of the comprehensive Duty of this Relation,&mdash;a <HI>Good and Faithful Ser|vant.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE></P>
<P>Whether these two Qualities are of a different Species I do not determine. A learned Writer thinks;
<Q>He is called <HI>Good,</HI> because He does the Good Will of his LORD; and <HI>Faithful,</HI> because He applies Himself to promote his MASTER'S Interest and none of his own separate from it.</Q>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pareus.</HI></NOTE> But as the <HI>Good and Faithful</HI> Servant is mainly op|pos'd to the <HI>Wicked and Slothful</HI> one immediately described; <HI>Good</HI> may be especially oppos'd to <HI>Wicked,</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> in the one to <HI>Slothful</HI> in the other. <HI>Goodness</HI> may therefore seem to signify his pious and prevailing Affection to the Service of CHRIST: and <HI>Faithfulness</HI> may point to his cons|ciencious,
<PB N="6" REF="003597_0012_0FF83491555F9E60">
careful and diligent Observance of his Engagements to HIM. Or <HI>Goodness</HI> may look to that Good Principle or Inclination from whence his Service flows; and <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to his continual Action and Perseverance in it.</P>
<P>Or if CHRIST intends the <HI>same individual Cha|racter</HI> by these two different Terms; they are then made use of, to express more strongly, how hear|tily He approves this Servant of his, and how sa|tisfied in Him.</P>
<P>I shall therefore consider the <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> as united in <HI>One,</HI> and displaying themselves in the following manner.</P>
<P>This GOOD <HI>and</HI> FAITHFUL <HI>Servant</HI> then, carries always in Him a <HI>cordial Inclination</HI> to the <HI>Service</HI> of his LORD. This lies the uppermost of all other things and cares in his new-form'd Heart. All o|ther things He justly accounts inferiour to it, and allows of nothing in competition with it. He has the like Conception with the highest <HI>Angels</HI> about the Throne &mdash; He esteems it the greatest Honour and Happiness, first to be advanc'd to his Likeness in every possible Excellency, and then to be always employ'd and accepted in the Service of their com|mon LORD. He desires nothing more than this, either in Earth or Heaven: He delights in nothing more: He daily groans, and is deeply humbled for his present great Inabilities thereto, and Deficien|cies therein: He longs for a compleat Deliverance from them in the future State: He rejoyces in the Prospect of it: and in the mean while He labours to have his Heart more strong and fixed in his pre|sent Work &amp; Duty.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003597_0013_0FF83493B7BFE190">His first Concern is with his own HEART: That this may be always <HI>Good and Upright</HI>; that no Ini|quity may be reigning here; that every sinful In|clination may be subdu'd, kept under, and also mortified more and more: that every gracious Dis|position may be kept alive and flourish in Him; and especially that vital <HI>Faith</HI> in CHRIST and THINGS INVISIBLE, and that active <HI>Love</HI> to GOD and <HI>Man,</HI> which are the moving Principles of all Fidelity and Goodness.</P>
<P>When he looks ABROAD, He is griev'd to see how little this <HI>Great LORD,</HI> the Lord of Heaven and Earth, is served in the World. How small the num|ber of them that even Profess to serve him: How many of these do in their Works deny him: and what great occasion there is to make the same Com|plaint with the Apostle of old, Phil. II.21. <HI>For all seek their own, not the things that are JESUS CHRIST's.</HI></P>
<P>He is greatly concern'd to see the Ignorance and Pride of some, the presumptuous Sins of others, the Uncharitableness and Contentions among his Neigh|bours, the Scandals of Professors, the Declensions of the Times, the Afflictions any meet with, the Calamities that threaten the Town or Land: and by how much more extensive the Evil is, or the In|terest or Honour of CHRIST or his <HI>Religion</HI> suffer or are like to suffer; the more sad his mind and the more deeply troubled.</P>
<P>He considers every kind of OBLIGATION lying upon him to lay out himself in serving this <HI>Greatest and Best of Masters</HI>: The infinite Excellence and Loveliness of his Divine Person; the great things he has already done, in Creation, Providence, Re|demption, Grace; the low State he condescended
<PB N="8" REF="003597_0014_0FF83495C544DC98">
to; the bitter Sufferings he underwent; the Glori|ous things he has dearly purchas'd, offer'd, urged; the gracious Operations of his HOLY SPIRIT; and the undeserved and boundless Love in all: the Re|velation of Him, and of the Way to serve him, the various Powers &amp; Opportunities therefor, the so|lemn Consecration of them all to promote his Glo|ry, and therein our own Eternal Interest: In short, his Eyes for ever on us now, and the strict Account he will surely call us to when our uncertain Life expires.</P>
<P>The <HI>Good and Faithful</HI> Servant lives in the REA|LIZING VIEWS of these things: and from them all he is conscienciously concerned to discharge the va|rious Trusts reposed in him, with Fidelity; to improve his Talents, Powers, Riches, Honours, Time and Op|portunities, in the Service of his Great LORD; to answer the Ends of the present Life, and of the special Circumstances wherein his Lord has plac'd him, to the constant Approbation of his all-seeing Eye, and therein his own present great Satisfacti|on and everlasting Interest.</P>
<P>He first maintains the POWER of these <HI>lively Mo|tives</HI> in him: by a frequent Thinking of them; by constant secret and mental Prayer; reading, hear|ing, and pondering on the WORD of GOD and then he applies himself to the clear Discovery of every Duty.</P>
<P>He receives the INSPIRED ORACLES as his only per|fect &amp; unerring Rule: He labours to understand the Meaning of 'em: He delights to converse with them: He receives all the Doctrines, Histories &amp; Precepts in them, with Faith &amp; Love: He applies them to himself: He lays them up in his Heart; i. e. in his Affection,
<PB N="9" REF="003597_0015_0FF83497B3A21BF0">
Memory and Conscience, ready to be call'd to mind and us'd on all Occasions. He sets the GLORY of this Supreme LORD, as his highest End: He subordi|nates all his Aims, Inclinations and Pursuits of o|ther things to this. And having found out the <HI>Means</HI> or <HI>Rules</HI> of promoting it, he carefully and constantly observes them. He wou'd not allow him|self in the Commission of the smallest Sin, nor in the Neglect of the smallest Duty: but he labours to stand compleat in the Will of his LORD.</P>
<P>First, He endeavours to pay to the <HI>Most High GOD</HI> all that <HI>more immediate</HI> WORSHIP and Adora|tion which He requires. And this not only in the constant Frame of his Mind, but in the frequent ri|sing up of his admiring Thoughts to the <HI>Perfecti|ons</HI> of this GLORIOUS BEING, appearing both in his <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Works</HI>; and especially in the various Operations of Providence, which offer themselves to his Senses and Observation.</P>
<P>At the Beginning and Ending of every Day, he likewise RETIRES from the rest of the World; that he may with a more fixed Intention look upon GOD in CHRIST, and in the Presence of Angels give Him his Glory: Loving &amp; Praising Him for all his Per|fections &amp; Benefits: Confessing and Mourning for his own Offences and increas'd Unworthiness: Pre|senting himself a new through the Mediation of CHRIST, as a living and holy Sacrifice to his Honour and Service: Imploring for Pardon, Grace and e|very Blessing both for himself and others; and Trusting in Him for the Bestowment of them. And O! what raised Views of Faith does he <HI>There</HI> some|times gain! engaging his Heart to this <HI>most</HI> AMIABLE BEING, transporting his Mind with the most grateful Sight of his Interest in Him, and kindling up in his Soul an holy Flame of Zeal to promote his Glory.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="003597_0016_0FF83499AFD76BD8">With his Well-ordered FAMILY, he also offers the Evening and the Morning Sacrifice: and by his Oversight and Cares, Example and Instructions, Admonitions and Reproofs, Corrections and En|couragements, Prayers and Tears; He labours to promote <HI>Religion</HI> in every one of his Houshold, to make those under his Care as good as himself, to keep alive the Power and Practice of Piety in them, and to transmit it to his Offspring after him. If he derives of a <HI>pious Family,</HI> he dreads nothing more than that he should be the last therein for Piety; least the Religion of the Family expire with him, and his Children forsake the <HI>GOD of their Fathers.</HI> However, he is deeply concern'd for their Souls, their everlasting Interest: He is afraid of their Temptations: He can scarce have any Rest or Ease in his own Mind, till he sees their Faces turned towards the heavenly <HI>Zion:</HI> Nothing gives him greater Glad|ness: He weeps for Joy, to see the Bloomings of Piety in them: And when he sees it &mdash; O! how Thankful is he to the <HI>GOD of all Grace!</HI> With what Comfort can he lay down himself to sleep in the Grave! and with what Satisfaction cry,&mdash;
<Q>LORD thy Servant now is freely willing to De|part in Peace! This Day thou hast sent Salvation into my House, and mine Eyes have seen it!</Q></P>
<P>From the Family, he gravely walks to the HOUSE of GOD: He apprehends it as the Gate of Heaven, He enters it with holy Joy and Reverence. He seriously attends on every Divine Institution there: He looks through them to the Glorious GOD: He worships Him in Spirit and Sincerity: He receives into a good and honest Heart, the Truths &amp; Pre|cepts there displayed and urged agreable to the INSPIRED WORD: He submits himself to their Di|vine Authority: In the very hearing he is resolved
<PB N="11" REF="003597_0017_0FF8349B4741B250">
to obey them. He keeps the <HI>Sabbath</HI> holy from the Beginning to the End: and throughout the <HI>Week,</HI> He labours to live up to his sacred Light &amp; Resolutions.</P>
<P>For HIMSELF, he Denies all Ungodliness and worldly Lusts, both in the sight of MEN and in the Eyes of GOD. He has a constant Guard upon him|self: He is temperate in his Diversions and Enjoy|ments; sober, chaste, modest and moderately cheerful in Society: He is afraid of going beyond the Bounds of Decency and Moderation: and he wou'd observe the Rules of Wisdom in all his Conduct.</P>
<P>In obedience to the Will of his LORD, he is careful and industrious in his SECULAR CALLING. He endeavours to provide for his own House-hold; and to get yet more for charitable and pious Uses: and herein he labours to do every thing in the most proper Time and Order. He resigns the Conduct of his Affairs to GOD: He leaves the Success with Him: He is submissive under Crosses; Contented with the Lot of Providence; Patient in Afflicti|ons; Mild and Humble in Prosperity: when Riches grow or Honours rise, he sets not his Heart upon them: He despises the Pomp and Glory of this lower World: He lives above it, and has his mind in Heaven.</P>
<P>In his DEALINGS with his <HI>Neighbours,</HI> he is cons|cienciously Just and Fair: True to perform his Word; careful to discharge his Debts: Meek in bearing Injuries; easy to be reconciled: Faithful to all his Friends: a special Lover of all that fear the LORD: Gentle towards all: an Enemy to no|thing but Profaness and Immorality: and is on all occasions ready to promote the Good of all. He

rejoyces with them who rejoyce; He mourns with them that mourn: He pities the Widow and the Orphan, the Poor and those that have none to help them: And he constantly abounds, but as secretly as may be, in acts of Charity and Kindness.</P>
<P>In short, He is not only careful to discharge the <HI>Trusts</HI> reposed in him with Integrity; But he is for doing more: His PUBLICK SPIRIT and BENEFICENCE are <HI>Unconfined.</HI> He is concerned for the Peace and Welfare of the Church, the Town, the Land where|in he dwells: He is ready to his Power to serve them: His Heart enlarges to promote the General Interest; to uphold and carry on the Kingdom of CHRIST in the Place of his abode; and to advance it in others, that others may be happy in it, and his Lord receive a greater Glory. He would do Good for the Unknown and them that know him not. He looks down into late Posterity: He wou'd have the Unborn the better for him: And beyond the reach of his immediate Influence, he extends his Wishes, and makes his Prayers for all Nations.</P>
<P>Thus he lives, and thus he serves his Divine Master to the Death. But in the midst and at the end of all, he bewails his great Deficiency: He humbly owns himself an unworthy Servant: He looks to the <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD in CHRIST alone, for Eternal Life: and <HI>Blessed is that Servant, whom His</HI> LORD, <HI>when He comes, shall find so Doing.</HI></P>
<P>We now proceed to consider</P>
<P N="2">II. The glorious APPROBATION CHRIST here expresses of and to Him, at the Period of his faith|ful Services, &mdash; <HI>Well Done! Good and Faithful Servant!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="003597_0019_0FF8349FA2617F98">The ultimate View of this Expression may perhaps extend to that great and illustrious Day which our LORD describes at the End of the present Para|ble. ver. 31. <HI>When the</HI> SON OF MAN <HI>shall come in his Glory, and all the Holy Angels with Him; then shall He set upon the Throne of his Glory, and before Him shall be gathered all Nations.</HI> Then may this happy Sentence be pronounced to all the Faithful, subsisting both in Soul and Body, collected into one vast Company, and in the Publick View and Hearing both of Men &amp; Angels in that great Day.</P>
<P>But yet, it seems to me, that this 31st ver. of the Chapter <HI>Begins</HI> the <HI>Description</HI> of the <HI>General Judgment,</HI> at the Winding up of the present State of things in this lower World: and that the <HI>Parable</HI> fore|going and including our Text, has a special Eye to the <HI>Particular Period</HI> of <HI>our several Lives</HI>; when our Times of Service and Probation end, and one Part of us, viz. the principal, the incorruptible and im|mortal <HI>Spirit,</HI> must needs be as ready as ever to give up its account, to receive its Sentence, and in Part its Recompence.</P>
<P>For in the <HI>Parable</HI> before us, the several Ser|vants are examined <HI>apart,</HI> according to their vari|ous Talents: And even the Sentences approving the Faithful are pronounced <HI>singly,</HI> first to Him that had improv'd his <HI>five</HI> Talents, ver. 21. <HI>Well Done</HI> THOU <HI>Good and Faithful Servant</HI>; and then the like to Him that had improv'd his <HI>two</HI> Talents, as in our Text: And so the Sentence on the <HI>other,</HI> ver. 26. THOU <HI>Wicked and Slothful Servant &amp;c.</HI> Whereas in the following <HI>Description</HI> of the <HI>General Judgment,</HI> all Nations are represented as appearing before the SON OF GOD; who divides them into two vast Assemblies, setting the Righteous at his Right Hand,
<PB N="14" REF="003597_0020_0FF834A12E664FA8">
the Wicked at his Left; and then pronounces first to them at his Right Hand, collectively&mdash; <HI>Come</HI> YE <HI>Blessed of my Father</HI> &amp;c: And then to them at his Left, in the like Plural number&mdash; <HI>Depart from Me</HI> YE <HI>cursed into Everlasting Fire,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The 30th. ver. seems therefore both to conclude our Parable with the present Life, as also to lead us on to the Description following. And the Meaning of this ver. may be &mdash;
<Q>My Holy Angels who are here ready to execute my Orders on the se|parate Spirit now before me&mdash; <HI>Cast ye the unpro|fitable Servant into outer Darkness</HI>; where he shall remain with Devils as in Chains and in a Dun|geon, without any Light of Hope or Comfort, re|served to the Judgment of the Great Day; when his Body shall be rais'd, and then in this Place of Darkness <HI>there</HI> SHALL BE <HI>weeping and gnashing of Teeth:</HI> [But <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"> &amp;c. v. 31. The discretive Word BUT being omitted in <HI>Our</HI> Translation, tho' retain'd in <HI>Beza</HI>'s.</NOTE>] <HI>when the Son of Man shall come in his Glory</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>However, this <HI>Outer Darkness</HI> is no doubt the State to which the UUPROFITABLE Servant is adjudged at the Period of his Probation, and for that Interval which lies between his Dying now and his Body's Rising to the General Judgment. And for the GOOD AND FAITHFUL &mdash; can any Proceedure be more agreeable to Reason, Justice, Wisdom, Good|ness, or the Nature of things; than that when he has passed thro' the State assign'd him for his Proba|tion, and behav'd himself with persevering Faith|fulness; He should then be call'd before his Judge, receive his approving Sentence, and without Delay, and as much as capable, his promised Recompence?</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="003597_0021_0FF834A2C004D260">Agreable to this, the Scriptures tell us; that when <HI>the</HI> DUST of the Body <HI>returns to the Earth, the</HI> SPI|RIT <HI>returns to GOD who gave it: that after</HI> DEATH, <HI>comes on the</HI> JUDGMENT: that <HI>CHRIST is ordained of GOD to be</HI> JUDGE <HI>both of Quick and Dead:</HI> that <HI>the FATHER judgeth no man,</HI> in an immediate man|ner, <HI>but hath committed all Judgment to the SON, that all may honour the SON as they honour the FATHER:</HI> that <HI>for this End CHRIST both died and rose and revived, that HE might be</HI> LORD <HI>both of the Dead and Living</HI>; and that <HI>we shall all stand before the</HI> JUDG|MENT SEAT <HI>of CHRIST.</HI> Rom. XIV.9, 10. And therefore the Apostle argues, 2 Cor. V.9, 10. <HI>Where|fore we labour, that whether</HI> PRESENT in the Body, <HI>or</HI> ABSENT from it, <HI>we may be</HI> ACCEPTED <HI>of Him; For we must all appear before the</HI> JUDGMENT SEAT <HI>of CHRIST</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>We are therefore now to view this Good and Faithful Servant as arriving to this Great Period: as having finished the Services appointed for Him, as having put off his earthly Garment, and in his Spirit appearing before this Lord and Judge of Quick and Dead.</P>
<P>With his vile and sinful Body, he has quite put off his sinful Nature: He is cleansed perfectly from all Pollution of Soul. And now the inward Consci|ousness of his sanctified Mind, his sincere Designs and his pious Bent, extends it self and fills his Pure Spirit with perfect Satisfaction. What a Joy pos|sesses him, to feel himself intirely releas'd from Sin, to perceive the Likeness of the Holy GOD arising in him, to find himself a Being suitable for Con|verse with Him, and in the mighty Hands of blessed <HI>Angels</HI> as his Friends, and Comforters!

Judge, will strike indeed with Reverence, as it does the <HI>Seraphims</HI> above, but not with Terror.</P>
<P>But O! the Voice! the surprizing Voice pro|ceeding from his Divine Lips &mdash; <HI>Well Done! Good and Faithful Servant!</HI> &mdash; With what a Look of overcoming Grace and Pleasure are these Words pronounced! and how full are they of Joy and Transport!</P>
<P>It is as if He should say&mdash;
<Q><HI>O my dear Servant!</HI> I have seen your Faith, your Love, your Pati|ence, your Integrity, your sincere Desires, your pious Purposes, your Perseverance! I have seen your Labours, your Charities, your Sufferings, your Godly Sorrows, your Strivings with Temp|tations, your Self-Denials, and all your Services for my Name and Interest! Mine Eye has been always on you: not the least has escap'd my notice: not one of all their number is forgotten by me: and I have seen them all with Plea|sure. I accept them all, and I approve you for them! I overlook, I pardon, I will never men|tion your Deficiencies: I only look at your Fi|delity: and I bid you welcome to the Eternal End of all your Trials!</Q></P>
<P>O <HI>most Lovely SAVIOUR!</HI> is this the Manner of thy Receiving the Spirits of thy Faithful Servants in their Returning to Thee! when of thy free and mighty Power and Grace, Thou at first hast made them thy willing Servants, who had been, before, thine inveterate Enemies! Thou didst allure them to Love Thee: Thou didst preserve them from reverting to their former Enmity: Thou didst reco|ver them from all their Falls: Thou didst excite them to all their Services: Thou didst support them un|der

all their Sufferings: Thou didst inspire their Strength in all their Conflicts: Thou hast crowned them with Eternal Victory &mdash; And now Thou speakest of nothing but their Goodness, Faithful|ness and Well-Doing! Thou hast made them <HI>Good</HI>; and now Thou commendest them for their Good|ness! Thou hast made them <HI>Faithful</HI>; and now Thou praisest their Fidelity! Thou hast helped them to <HI>Do all the Good</HI> they have Done; and now in the Presence of Angels Thou applaudest their Well-Doing! &mdash; <HI>But</HI> They <HI>shall give the</HI> GLORY <HI>of all to THEE, for ever!</HI></P>
<P>Nor is all this any other than a <HI>Preparation</HI> for that unspeakable, endless and ever-growing Hap|piness He has designed for them. They are now but just arriv'd at the Border of it. And their Glo|rious Judge proceeds to bid them <HI>Enter into the</HI> JOY <HI>of</HI> their <HI>LORD.</HI></P>
<P>We are therefore come in the</P>
<P N="3">III. and last place, To take a distant, but as clear a Prospect as we are able, at present, to form, of <HI>the</HI> JOY <HI>of his LORD,</HI> which this Faithful Servant is now welcomed into.</P>
<P>We are not Here to extend our Views to that State of Bliss which lies beyond the first Resurrecti|on: But to the <HI>Present State</HI> of the <HI>Spirits of the Just made Perfect</HI> in the Invisible World, and which rea|ches no farther than the <HI>Descent</HI> of CHRIST from Heaven in flaming Fire to Destroy the Wicked.</P>
<P>And here the inspired Scriptures give such Hints as these &mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="003597_0024_0FF834A9AB3658F0">There were several APPEARANCES of the LORD Himself, both to our <HI>first Parents</HI> before they sinned and after; as also to <HI>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Daniel</HI> and others. There were also many <HI>Appea|rances</HI> of the Holy ANGELS in those ancient Times. And in those Appearances there were Humane Colours, Shapes and Voices; by means of which they conversed with Men cloathed with Flesh, and therefore doubtless could in like manner appear and converse with one another. They appeared to see and hear us; as well as to be seen, and heard by us: i. e. they produced those Impressions in the <HI>Medium</HI> between Their Spirits and Ours, which we distinguish by the names of several Sounds and Co|lours; and they perceived the like Impressions made by us. No doubt they appeared with a Beauty suitable to their excelling Natures, and with such a Distinction as to carry an Evidence with it, that one was the Lord JEHOVAH, and the other his created <HI>Angels.</HI> Each <HI>Angel</HI> had also doubtless a Personal and distinct Appearance, whereby they might be known from one another. Some appear|ed as youthful Men; some in long and shining Gar|ments; in some their Countenance appeared like Lightning, and their Raiment white as Snow. And it seems to be only because we are in a <HI>different Part</HI> of the <HI>Scheme</HI> of PROVIDENCE, wherein our sensible Intercourse with the Invisible World is Barr'd, for various weighty Reasons I have no place now to mention; that they do not appear and converse with us, with <HI>the Faithful</HI> especially every Day.</P>
<P>It is as easy then to conceive, how the <HI>Spirit</HI> divested of the dull, unweildy Body, may ap|pear and converse with <HI>other Spirits</HI> and <HI>Angels,</HI> i. e. both appear and see and speak and hear each other; as it is for them to appear and converse with
<PB N="19" REF="003597_0025_0FF834ABA3719FA8" MS="y">
us while we are cloath'd with the Body. <HI>Appea|rances, Sounds</HI> and <HI>Visions,</HI> among the SPIRITS and ANGELS, are therefore no such difficult things to ap|prehend as we are apt to imagine. And indeed, 'tis only our Ignorance or want of Contemplation, that renders it more difficult for us to conceive of the Appearance and Converse of Angels and un|embodied Spirits; than of our present Appearing and Conversing with the Souls of each other while we may remain embodied, and so thro' double and different <HI>Mediums</HI> between us.</P>
<P>You may scarce allow me to consider the Nature of these things nicely upon such a grave Occasion. But from 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> V.1,&mdash;7. it seems to me, That upon the Apostle's SPIRIT being <HI>uncloathed</HI> of his BODY, which he calls his <HI>Earthly House</HI> or Dwelling; he expected to have his Spirit <HI>cloath'd upon</HI> with a CELESTIAL SUBSTANCE, which he calls his <HI>House from Heaven:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>From,</HI> or <HI>Out of Heaven</HI>; not&mdash;<HI>Out of the Earth,</HI> as the Resurrection-Body is to be.</NOTE> So that when he came to be Ab|sent from the Body and Present with the Lord; his pure Spirit wou'd not appear naked or uncloathed, but cloathed with a <HI>Celestial Substance,</HI> made by the supernatural Power of GOD and annexed to the Soul for its various Uses and Perceptions of the wondrous Objects in that upper World of Light and Glory.</P>
<P>Such <HI>Celestial Substances</HI> the HOLY ANGELS may be also cloathed with, as their proper <HI>Seats</HI> &amp; <HI>In|struments.</HI> And by these, both Spirits and Angels may as easily make and receive Impressions, but in|conceivably more Perfect than our Spirits can, by their Earthy, gross and dull Bodies. By such Celestial Substances, the <HI>Holy Angels</HI> may have ap|pear'd
<PB N="20" REF="003597_0026_0FF834AD6408BF28">
and spoke and shined in this lower World. And by such a one, it may be, <HI>Moses,</HI> if his Body was not Raised, appear'd and Spoke at <HI>the Trans|figuration.</HI></P>
<P>I might easily explain this matter further: But I must forbare&mdash;</P>
<P>In the Scriptures we also read of a GLORIOUS PLACE whither the HUMANE NATURE of CHRIST triumphantly ascended, and therein illustriously re|sides with the <HI>Spirits of the Just made Perfect</HI> and Ten thousand times ten thousands of <HI>Holy Angels</HI> round about Him, till the <HI>Restitution</HI> of this disor|der'd World. To this both CHRIST Himself and the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> give the name of PARADICE; the Martyr <HI>Stephen,</HI> the Evangelist <HI>Luke,</HI> with the A|postles <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>John</HI> &mdash; the name of HEAVEN; and the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> &mdash; the THIRD HEAVEN, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> XII.2&mdash;4. Thither the ancient <HI>Elijah</HI> is said to ascend both in Soul and Body long before. Thi|ther no doubt ascended <HI>Enoch</HI> at his Translation, and all <HI>those Saints</HI> that rose out of their Graves at our SAVIOUR'S Resurrection. And there the se|parate Soul of CHRIST Himself, with the separate Soul of the <HI>Believing Penitent</HI> expiring by his side on the Cross, were to be together on the very Day of their Crucifixion.</P>
<P>Of this happy Place our Blessed Saviour seems to speak a little before He left the Earth. Joh. XII.23. <HI>The Hour is come that the Son of man should be</HI> GLORIFIED: v. 26. <HI>If any man serve Me, Let him follow Me: and</HI> WHERE <HI>I am,</HI> THERE <HI>shall also my Servant be.</HI> Some Glympses of the same he also gives us in the Final Prayer he made the Evening before he suffered. <HI>He lift up his Eyes to Heaven,
<PB N="21" REF="003597_0027_0FF834AF5A0BCD08">
and said,</HI> FATHER! <HI>the Hour is come! Glorify thy</HI> SON, <HI>that thy</HI> SON <HI>also may Glorify</HI> THEE! &mdash;<HI>I have Glorified Thee on the Earth: I have</HI> FINISHED <HI>the Work which Thou gavest me to Do: and</HI> NOW, <HI>O FATHER! Glorify Thou Me with Thine own self, with the Glory which I had with Thee before the World was&mdash; FATHER! I will that They also whom Thou hast given Me, be</HI> WITH ME WHERE I AM; <HI>that They may behold my Glory which Thou hast given Me&mdash; And the Glory which Thou gavest Me, I have given Them; that They may be One, even as We are One!</HI></P>
<P>This upper World is represented therefore as a Place of perfect LIGHT and GLORY. It is the <HI>Glory</HI> into which CHRIST entered upon his passing thro' his Sufferings: <HI>Luk.</HI> XXIV.26. And the Apostle calls it <HI>the Inheritance of the Saints in</HI> LIGHT, Col. I.12.</P>
<P>Thither the same Apostle was once caught up, whether in the Body or out of the Body, he could not tell; and there he had such Visions and Reve|lations, and heard unspeakable Words which it was not lawful or allow'd for man to utter. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> XII.1&mdash;7. These were some of those Unseen and E|ternal Things which this Apostle look'd to: Here is the Building of GOD Himself, an House not made with Hands, Eternal in the Heavens; which he knew he should be cloathed with upon his put|ting off the Garment of the Body: Here was the immediate Presence of his LORD: and for this the Apostle was confident and willing rather to be absent from the Body, that he might be Present with that <HI>Great Object</HI> of his perpetual Admiration and Desire. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> IV.17&mdash;V.8.</P>
<P>Of this same Heavenly State he seems to give us some faint Resemblance in <HI>Heb.</HI> XII.22&mdash;24. <HI>But
<PB N="22" REF="003597_0028_0FF834B152FAE300">
ye are come</HI> i. e. in your more immediate, believing and delighful Views, <HI>unto mount</HI> ZION, <HI>and to the City of the Living GOD, the Heavenly</HI> JERUSALEM, <HI>and to an innumerable Company of</HI> ANGELS; <HI>to the General Assembly &amp; Church of the</HI> FIRST BORN <HI>which are</HI> enroll'd <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">English Margin.</NOTE> <HI>in Heaven, and to GOD the Judge of all, and to the</HI> SPIRITS <HI>of Just men made Perfect, and to JESUS the Mediator of the New Covenant</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the <HI>immediate Presence</HI> of the SON OF GOD must needs be a <HI>Fulness of Joy and Pleasure</HI> for his People&punc; And this must needs be the <HI>Place of Joy</HI> into which the separate Spirit of the Faithful Ser|vant is bid to enter upon its leaving the Earthly Tabernacle and appearing before Him.</P>
<P><HI>Enter Thou into the</HI> JOY <HI>of thy LORD!</HI> &mdash;
<Q>Thou hast been Tried, and Thou art found Faith|ful&mdash;Thou shalt be Tried no more! Thou hast lived in a <HI>World of Sorrow</HI>&mdash; But now thy Sorrows shall end for ever, and Thou shalt enter into a <HI>World of Joy!</HI> Thou hast passed thro' a <HI>State</HI> of Self-Denial and <HI>Humiliation,</HI> as thy LORD had done before Thee &mdash; Thou now shalt enter after Him into a <HI>State of Glory.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>It is <HI>the Joy of thy LORD</HI>&mdash; the Joyful Place and State which was set before Him, to enliven Him to endure the Cross and despise the Shame, till He ascended and sat down at the Right Hand of the Throne of GOD. The Joy which He now possesses, which is worthy of all his Suffer|ings, and which will fill You with perfect Satis|faction! You shall enter in to be with Him: You shall partake with Him in his Joy and Blessed|ness!
<PB N="23" REF="003597_0029_0FF834B34E9F6498">
You shall for ever live in his happy Pre|sence, and in the joyous Company of these innu|merable <HI>Holy Angels</HI> and <HI>Shining Spirits</HI> round about Him! You shall with them see the Ful|ness of his Glory: You shall be filled with the Vision: You shall be filled with the Likeness: the Glory shall never fade, the Company shall never brake, and the Joy shall never end!</Q></P>
<P><Q>O! <HI>Happy Servant!</HI> &mdash;We now by Faith look after Thee! We congratulate thine Entrance There! and we long to rise and enter with Thee!</Q></P>
<P>And thus we have seen some faint Description of the <HI>Good and Faithful Servant</HI> passing thro' his State of Trial in this lower World, the Glorious <HI>Approbation</HI> given Him by his Divine Master at the Period of it, and <HI>the Joy of his LORD</HI> which there|on He enters immediately into.</P>
<P>And now &mdash; To IMPROVE these Things &mdash; Our</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Concern of all, must be to get a Great, a Strong, a Lively</HI> FAITH <HI>in these invisible Realities, and to keep the same in a constant Exercise.</HI></P>
<P>If this Heavenly State of Bliss and Joy be <HI>Real,</HI> it is of the utmost Moment that we make sure of it: and it is of the utmost Moment that we <HI>Believe</HI> it to be <HI>Real,</HI> or we are sure to loose it. If we Believe it not to be a certain Thing now subsisting in the Heavenly World; we cannot possibly be so con|cern'd about it, as to labour after it in earnest and persevere therein till we come to enjoy it. For if we don't Believe there are such Joys and Glories There; we don't Believe that CHRIST Himself
<PB N="24" REF="003597_0030_0FF834B55E9F3FA8">
is There: and then I'm sure we cannot be Good and Faithful Servants to Him.</P>
<P>Nor will a bare or faint Perswasion of these Great Truths suffice: There must be such a <HI>mighty Faith</HI> as is wro't alone by the <HI>Power</HI> of GOD: Such a Faith as makes them <HI>Evident,</HI> and not obscure; and such a Faith as gives them a <HI>Subsistence</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">, Heb. XI.1.</NOTE> in us, as if they were actually present with us.</P>
<P>And this lively Faith in these Heavenly Things had need be <HI>constantly kept in Exercise:</HI> or we shall never be able to subdue our Lusts, or resist Temp|tations; we shall never be able to rise above this World, or act for ETERNITY. It is this lively Faith that inflames our Love to CHRIST, and that en|livens and excites our Souls to his active Service: It is this that destroys Hypocrisy and makes us Upright: It is the powerful Principle of all Fidelity.</P>
<P>Let us therefore earnestly and incessantly Pray for this Great Operation and Gift of GOD. In the use of every Means, Let us look for his effectual In|fluence. And when we obtain it, Let us also labour, in the use of every Means, to keep it alive in its Power and Vigour: Such as frequent Prayer; Reading and Hearing the Word; attending on the Holy Sacraments; Retirement from Earthly Things; and Contemplation upon CHRIST, the Great, immediate and moving <HI>Object</HI> of our Faith &amp; Piety.</P>
<P>And being possess'd of this most essential &amp; vital Principle; Let us then</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Improve it to Quicken us to a Life of</HI> Faith|ful <HI>and</HI> abounding SERVICES <HI>to this Glorious LORD.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="003597_0031_0FF834B7C2F1E030">Let us now Devote Our selves, and all we have, to Him for ever.

<P>Let us live as those that are now upon a <HI>Trial</HI> for a certain ETERNITY; that are hastening greatly to it, and are even just upon the Borders of it&mdash;the <HI>Door</HI> of that amazing World opening &mdash; the Tribunal of CHRIST appearing &mdash; and let the Prospect of his saying to us&mdash; <HI>Well Done! Good and Faithful Ser|vant!</HI> Excite us to the utmost so to serve Him, as becomes this Blessed Character.</P>
<P>In fine, Let us constantly reflect and ask our selves &mdash;
<Q>Am I now a Good and Faithful Ser|vant to this all-seeing Eye? Is this to be so? or were I now to appear before Him, could He Pronounce this of me? &mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Surely such Reflections made in the Power of Faith, wou'd awaken our drowsy Souls, and put us upon vigorous Action and Fidelity.</P>
<P N="3">3. For our further Excitement; <HI>Let us wisely va|lue and improve those</HI> Remarkable Instances <HI>of</HI> Good and Faithful SERVANTS <HI>to this Blessed LORD, as have Liv'd and Died among us.</HI></P>

<P>Were I to endeavour to set forth all his Vertues, I should scarce know where to Begin nor when to End. And I am easy in this, that my Lot is fallen to draw so unexceptionable and so unenvied a Character, that I need not fear exceeding to the offence of any that knew Him.</P>
<P>The very Name of Mr. DANIEL OLIVER &mdash;How many grateful Ideas did it use to raise in every Mind? To the <HI>Name</HI> there seem'd to be annex'd, the Beauty of pure Religion, a plain and unaffect|ed Mein, a serious and humble Countenance, a sin|cere and tender Heart, a cautious &amp; prudent Speech, a consciencious Justice and Integrity, a peaceable and Publick Spirit, an abounding Charity, a perpe|tual Diligence, an exact Oeconomy, a Mind above Earthly Pomps and Pleasures: In short, all the Vir|tues that form an <HI>eminent Christian,</HI> and that make Him lovely and admired in our Eyes. None cou'd see Him till now without some Pleasure &mdash; and none can name Him now without some Sorrow.</P>
<P>But my Design is not to launch into a Sea of Praise. I shall only mind you of some of the many Graces in Him, for which we us'd to esteem and
<PB N="27" REF="003597_0033_0FF834BBB5063BE8">
love Him; that may serve to make us sensible of our great Loss, and excite our lively Imitation.</P>
<P>It was happy for him indeed to have been Born of <HI>Religious Parents,</HI> and in the Pious Times of this Town and Land. <HI>Religion</HI> then was the prevail|ing Spirit here without a Rival. And wherever he turned his Eyes, he saw many bright Examples of the Power and Practice of it, to convince him 'twas a Real and a Serious thing, and to raise his Esteem and Reverence.</P>
<P>This was no doubt a special <HI>means</HI>: But it was the SPIRIT <HI>of Grace</HI> that wrought and bent his Heart for GOD in His Early Days. He then de|voted Himself to serve his LORD: He made <HI>Re|ligion</HI> an affair in earnest; tho' Careful &amp; Diligent also in his <HI>Temporal Business.</HI> He had then the Wisdom to Redeem his Time: and He so contriv'd it, that they should not interfere with each other.</P>
<P>His Custom was to Rise up <HI>very Early</HI>; to Read the Scriptures and other Books of Piety alone, and Pray and Converse with GOD, while the Rest of the World were Sleeping: and these he us'd to account his most precious Hours. By this means his Heart was fix'd a new with a Religious Frame and fresh Designs of Good for the following Day: and as the Day came on, He was forward also in his <HI>Secular Business.</HI> He went forth of his House with a clear Conscience, and under the Favour and Conduct of Heaven.</P>
<P>From the Days of his Youth He lov'd and chose the <HI>Religious</HI> for his <HI>dear Companions.</HI> He <HI>avoided</HI> the <HI>Taverns</HI> as Places of great Temptation and Ex|pence of Time. When others resorted to them,
<PB N="28" REF="003597_0034_0FF834BDAD7B5750">
He chose rather to go wherever He heard of any Exercise of Piety. When Recreation was needed towards the Evening; He either rode out for Health, either alone or with some chosen Companion; or made his agreable and useful Visits to his parti|cular Friends, or else to his poor or afflicted Neigh|bours, to help or comfort them. He indeed often diverted Himself by changing his Business only: By leaving his own Affairs, and contriving and doing Good unto others; for which he had a sin|gular Spirit, and in which He delighted.</P>
<P>Thus he took the Right &amp; Best way of Living. He first and early Begins with Religion: He then with Forecast, Care, and Diligence applies Himself to his secular Business: and when he had got thro' this; he mostly diverted himself with doing Good, or visiting those that wanted him or were glad to see him.</P>
<P>He was a strict Observer of the <HI>Holy</HI> SABBATH. He tho't there was no Occasion of Differing about the Beginning or Ending of it: They who <HI>Begin in the Morning,</HI> He would say,
<Q>might improve the Evening before as a suitable Time of Prepa|ration; those who <HI>Begin in the Evening</HI> before, may improve the Evening after as an agreable Season of Looking back on the preceeding Duties, or Reading Books of Piety &amp;c.</Q>
and He accord|ingly kept his Family within his Gates both on the Evening before and after. His Walk to the Place of Worship was Grave and Early: and when seat|ed There, he always appear'd as one that minded nothing but the Holy Duties There transacting. &mdash; No noise, nor lifting up of Eyes or Hands &mdash; only a decent Gesture, with a serious and attentive Countenance. He indeed kept up the ancient
<PB N="29" REF="003597_0035_0FF834BFB5D00040">
Practice of Writing from the mouth of the Preacher; that he might not quickly forget, but repeat some useful Truths and Precepts in his <HI>Family</HI> at the End of the Day. And THIS with the happy Assistance of his <HI>worthy Consort,</HI> he always kept in excellent Order. Here he not only daily read the Scripture and Prayed; But he charged his House-hold to walk in the Paths of Piety; as he allur'd and led them the way by his lively Example.</P>
<P>He lov'd the Conversation of <HI>Ministers</HI> and sober <HI>Scholars.</HI> His Table was always free, and often surrounded with them, especially at our <HI>Weekly Lectures.</HI> When the Lecture was over, he wou'd look out for them: when he miss'd them, They knew they should be welcome to him: He was troubled when he happen'd to Dine without them: And was often doing them Services; which some Deceas'd have testified, and others alive can tell.</P>
<P>He was always remarkable also for attending the <HI>Lectures</HI> in the <HI>Neighbouring Towns.</HI> By which he at once reliev'd himself of the weight of Business, promoted the Health both of Body and Soul, in|form'd himself of the State of Religion &amp; Pro|vidence, and met with fresh Occasions of doing some Good. And he had so careful and exact a Fore|sight, and so happy a Faculty in ordering matters; that as he went out in Season, he return'd in Season, and let not his Business suffer or run behind hand by his going abroad. There was no moving him from his exact and regular manner of Living.</P>
<P>He was always noted among us for being strictly <HI>Just and Punctual</HI> in all <HI>his Dealings.</HI> Some tho't him rather too nice in this to a Penny. Conside|rate in making a Promise: Consciencious to re|member
<PB N="30" REF="003597_0036_0FF834C149AEBAB0">
and keep his Word; and to discharge the <HI>Trusts</HI> both of a Publick and Private nature, which either the Town or Government, or his Friends, by Wills or otherwise, had reposed in him.</P>
<P>He was remarkably careful for <HI>Paying his La|bourers</HI> when they first came for their Dues. And he wou'd often rebuke his Friends for putting them off; and tell them&mdash;
<Q>The Poor's Time was their Money and their necessary Subsistence; and 'twas a great Injustice and Hardship therefore, to make them spend their Time in coming for what was their own, for what they had earned, and 'twas likely very much wanted.</Q></P>
<P>He was as Good and Faithful <HI>a Friend</HI> as ever I knew. He was concerned for his Friend as for a na|tural Brother, not only ready to advise &amp; help them in any Emergency; but was even <HI>Watchful</HI> over them, least there should any thing happen amiss in their Conduct that might be in Danger to hurt them: not to observe it to others, but in private to them. When he saw or heard of any such thing, he wou'd quickly come and impart his Sorrow; and where there was need, give a friendly <HI>Reproof</HI> or <HI>Caution.</HI> When he smote them, it was a Kindness to them: when he reprov'd them, it was an excellent Oyl that broke not the Head, but healed the Wound. He was one of the most suitable Persons for this&mdash; he had so few Faults of his own, and yet was so humble and ready to censure himself. When he had rebuked them faithfully; they almost always expected some other Kindness soon after to follow. And he would do more Kindnesses for them than ever he told them: They would often find it only by Accidence.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="003597_0037_0FF834C35439D758">He had nothing of an overbaring or assuming Spirit. His Words in Conversation were not many, but wise. And there was such an unusual Mixture of <HI>Strictness</HI> and <HI>Gentleness</HI> in Him as I have scarce ever beheld. The <HI>latter</HI> so temper'd the <HI>former</HI> as took off all its disagreable View: And we were rather asham'd than afraid of his Reprehensions.</P>
<P>He was of a very <HI>Sympathizing</HI> Heart. He us'd to finish his Secular Business by <HI>Saturday Noon</HI>; and spend the <HI>Rest</HI> of the Day in visiting the <HI>Sick</HI> in the neighbourhood. He constantly attended the <HI>Fune|rals</HI> of his Acquaintance, tho' of low Degree. He much rather chose to go to the House of Mourn|ing than to the House of Feasting. He us'd to say,
<Q>He found it a needful means to keep his own Mortality in View, to show him afresh the Vanity of Earthly Things, call off his Mind from being taken up too much with them, and restrain it from growing too light and volatile.</Q>
When any of <HI>his distant Friends</HI> met with any <HI>Grievous</HI> Providence; he would carefully mind them, and redeem so much time, either early in the Morning, or even in his Warehouse in the little Intervals of Business, as to write them Letters of Condolence, Advice and Comfort. And when they met with signal <HI>Mercies</HI>; he wou'd also send them his friend|ly Lines; not of Complement or Form, but of religious Joy and Counsel. And indeed, Ceremo|ny, Form and Complement, were very averse to his Genius.</P>
<P>But there was no Employment in which he took more Pleasure, than in being <HI>Overseer of the Poor</HI> of the Town. He wou'd often visit them and in|quire into their Cases; especially in Times of Sick|ness and Sorrow. The meanest was not beneath
<PB N="32" REF="003597_0038_0FF834C5C8422A90">
his Notice. He has doubtless bestowed numberless Charities of his own upon them, which GOD and his <HI>Angels</HI> have only seen. He was concerned especially for the Training up of <HI>their Offspring,</HI> both to Reading, Religion and Business. He has sometimes himself, maintain'd a School of <HI>Thirty</HI> of their Children: and he excited others to follow him in the same kind of extensive Charity. He built a considerable <HI>House</HI> for the Purpose Here at his own Expence; and in his <HI>Will</HI> has given it for the Schooling of the Children of the Poor to all Generations. The first Instance of the Kind, I think, on this side the Water.</P>
<P>He was known to be of a <HI>very Publick Spirit.</HI> He was one of the most deeply concern'd for our grow|ing Declensions, Sins and Dangers. When any Calamity threatned the Publick, he had but little Ease: when any came upon us, he had but little Comfort. He accounted Contention as one of the sorest Calamities: He was exceeding sollicitous for Peace and Concord. He was anxiously concern'd and troubled at the Flood of Intemperance and Profaness rising up in the Town and spreading into the Land. And how often has he spoke with great Grief of the <HI>Taverns,</HI> as the mischievous Fountains of Profaness, Disorder and Publick Poverty, and as Threatning the Ruin of all Religion.</P>
<P>When he saw Trangressors, he was greatly griev|ed. When Professors miscarried, he sadly mourned. When the Righteous and Useful were taken away, he deeply laid it to Heart: When such were in Danger by Sickness in any part of the Town, he was much concern'd, and would take care to visit them. He was concern'd for the Revival of Piety in the Town and Land. And he was remarkably
<PB N="33" REF="003597_0039_0FF834C7C4A27A48">
<HI>Forward</HI> to contribute largely for the Propagation of it to the Neighbouring Countries.</P>
<P>In Fine, He was for pure, silent, unaffected and plain Christianity: not for the gaudy Pomp or noisy Sound: nor was he asham'd of serious and strict Religion in the Face of any.</P>
<P>And after all this eminent Life and Virtue &mdash; who appear'd more <HI>modest</HI> and <HI>humble</HI> than He? The least Lisp of Commendation was sure to raise his Frown, and move him instantly to check and stop us.&mdash;Lowly in his own Eyes: Preferring others above himself: Backward to appear and speak in Publick: Scarce perswaded to continue in <HI>His Majesty's Council,</HI> least he should hinder the Choice of others whom he tho't more able to serve his Country There &mdash; His Face, like <HI>Moses,</HI> came down the Mountain shining in the Eyes of others; and He wist it not.</P>
<P>This is Part of the Man we are bereaved of!&mdash; And how great the Loss! &mdash; His <HI>Example</HI> very much help'd to keep up the <HI>Reputation</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> among us. In such Men we see both its Reality, Power and Excellence; It appears with Comeli|ness and Majesty, to charm our Love, as well as raise our Reverence; it bares a convincing Wit|ness against the Apostacies &amp; Vices of the Times. And if it has not now an happy Influence to draw us to be Religious too; it will surely rise up against us and condemn us in the Future Judgment.</P>
<P>Can the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>such a Father</HI> as this &mdash; be any other than eminent like Him? They have had greater Advantages than others: their Ob|ligations
<PB N="34" REF="003597_0040_0FF834C950B9B148">
are therefore greater: and upon <HI>You his Rising Sons,</HI> are the Eyes of all Good People fixed, thro' this Town and Land; that You will stand up in his Room, and make Good his Ground. And with your Sorrowful <HI>Mother,</HI> You doubtless have the Confluence of their universal Prayers and Blessings!</P>
<P>And can any of <HI>Us who knew Him,</HI> ever forget the Dear Example? How often have we applied those Words to <HI>Him</HI> which the <HI>Angel</HI> once spoke to another &mdash; <HI>O</HI> DANIEL! <HI>a Man greatly Beloved!</HI> or <HI>a Man of Desires,</HI> as it is in the Hebrew? And shall not <HI>Religion</HI> be always the more Lovely to us, for the Beauty thereof which has appeared in Him?</P>
<P>And now, If it had not been my Lot to improve this Providence at the <HI>General Lecture</HI> of this Great Town; I shou'd have applied these things to that respectful CONGREGATION, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The South Church.</NOTE> of which our FRIEND has been a shining Ornament from his Youthful Age; and in whose withdraw They bare a spe|cial Share of Loss and Sorrow.</P>
<P>I shall therefore only observe, that as He used constantly to beautify <HI>this Publick Lecture,</HI> and we are Here to see his Face no more; He was <HI>one of the last</HI> who is bringing up the Rear of the <HI>Second Generation</HI> of the <HI>Founders</HI> of this Colony: and in Him we have seen the lively Image of their Piety and Spirit. There is but Here and There a <HI>Son</HI> remaining; and our Glory seems to be passing away with them!</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="003597_0041_0FF834CBE6DCA390">O! Let us therefore bow our Knees to the FA|THER of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, of whom the whole Family both in Heaven &amp; Earth are na|med; and earnestly implore, that He would pour out His SPIRIT from on High upon Us &amp; our Offspring. That We and They after us may rise up in our Times, to follow their bright Examples, to answer their strong Desires, and to keep alive the Work of Pure Religion in the Power and Practice of it; for which <HI>our Fathers</HI> have made so many Prayers and taken so much Pains, and for which <HI>their Fa|thers</HI> before them chose to come and Live &amp; Dye in these then hideous Ends of the Earth.</P>
<P>Let us then chuse <HI>their GOD</HI> for <HI>ours,</HI> His WORD for the <HI>only Rule</HI> of our <HI>Religion,</HI> His <HI>Institutions only</HI> for our Observance, and not content our selves with the Form of <HI>Godliness</HI> without the <HI>Life and Power.</HI> And let us bring up <HI>our Children</HI> also, as They bro't up <HI>Us</HI> &mdash; That His Spiritual Presence may continue with us, and We may have the Joy to see <HI>our Posterity</HI> like to follow into <HI>that happy World</HI> which our Pious Fa|thers are gone into &mdash; that They, I say, may fol|low in their Times, and continually bring Accessions thither to our Joy and Blessedness. To come into the Presence of our FATHERS <HI>There</HI>; To have <HI>our Children</HI> come in after us; and for them to tell us, that <HI>their Children</HI> are serving CHRIST &amp; their Generation, and are coming too&mdash; It will increase the Joy of Heaven it self, and both multiply and raise our continual Satisfactions.</P>

<P><HI>BOSTON,</HI>
<DATE><HI>July</HI> 27. 1732.</DATE></P>
<P>THe last Lord's Day Noon Expired here the Honourable DANIEL OLIVER, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>; One of His Majesty's Council for the Pro|vince, and one of the most considerable Merchants of this Place, in the 69th Year of his Age: being Born Here <HI>Feb.</HI> 1663, 4. He was the youngest Son of Capt. <HI>Peter Oliver,</HI> a Gentleman of good Repute in his Day, and one of the Principal Founders of the <HI>South</HI> or <HI>Third Church</HI> in <HI>Boston,</HI> in <HI>May</HI> 1669. The late Mr. <HI>Na|thaniel Oliver</HI> a worthy Merchant of this Town, and the late cele|brated Physician Dr. <HI>James Oliver</HI> of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> being Elder Bre|thren to the now Deceased. In <HI>April</HI> 1696, He Married Mrs. ELIZABETH the <HI>Second Daughter</HI> of the late Honourable ANDREW BELCHER, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Father to the Present GOVERNOUR: and by Her had the late Mr. <HI>Daniel Oliver</HI> Merchant, who going over to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> Died of the Small-Pox There on <HI>July</HI> 5. 1727; and Two younger Sons, Mr. <HI>Andrew</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peter Oliver,</HI> with their be|reaved Mother, now living. And he brought up all his Sons to the <HI>College.</HI> He has been distinguish'd for his eminent Piety, Hu|mility and Charity from his early Days. Was formerly many Years one of the <HI>Select-Men,</HI> and for many more, one of the <HI>Over|seers of the Poor,</HI> a <HI>Justice of the Peace,</HI> and at length a <HI>Councellor.</HI> In every Station He behav'd Himself with great Diligence and unblemished Integrity: has for a long course of Years enjoy'd the high Esteem and Love of <HI>this Town</HI> and <HI>Country,</HI> and been re|markably fam'd and valued in <HI>Others.</HI></P>
<P>He was up at <HI>Cambridge</HI> on Yesterday was sev'night, came home in the Evening, and went to Bed in his usual Health: But a little after Midnight, making an unusual noise in his Throat, His Consort spoke to Him, but perceiving Him unable to return an Answer, quickly found Him seiz'd with a <HI>Numb Palsey</HI> and <HI>Coma:</HI> out of which he reviv'd something on the Friday, but Relapsing, died to our universal Surprize and Sorrow: And was yesterday inter'd with distinguishing Respect &amp; Honour.</P>
<P>He has left a considerable Estate. And as He was a great Friend to the Poor; his Charity especially inclin'd him to promote the School Education of their Children. And in his Will among o|ther Legacies, He has bestowed a pretty large House, call'd the <HI>Spinning-School,</HI> for which Use He first design'd it, and which cost Him <HI>Six Hundred Pounds,</HI>&mdash; This <HI>House</HI> with the <HI>Profits,</HI> which will bring in about <HI>Fifty Pounds</HI> a Year, He has given for ever, to Support a School, to learn poor Children to Read the Scriptures, &amp;c. And thus &mdash; <HI>He hath dispersed abroad, He hath given to the Poor, His Righteousness remaineth for ever.</HI></P>

<P>He being Dead, yet Speaketh.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A Short, surprizing, but instructive Sen|tence! &mdash; And in Discoursing on it, I shall First consider it in <HI>It self</HI> alone; and Then raise those <HI>Observations</HI> from it which it most fairly offers.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Consider it in</HI> ITSELF <HI>alone.</HI> &mdash; And here are three things,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Person</HI> mentioned.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. His <HI>Death.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. and lastly, <HI>His Speaking</HI> after it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The</HI> PERSON <HI>mentioned.</HI> &mdash; And this is ABEL, one of the hopeful Sons of our Father <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>Even in his Bloom of Youth He appears to have resisted the strong Temptations round about him. He liv'd a blameless, regular and righteous Life. Both his Person and Services were very grateful
<PB N="2" REF="003597_0045_0FF834D322723CC0">
to the Holy GOD. And his Conduct was a lovely Pattern to the Age wherein he lived.</P>
<P>By the IV of <HI>Genesis</HI> and the 25<HI>th,</HI> He seems to have been very much his <HI>Parents</HI> Hope &amp; Comfort in his Day; and to have been particularly dear to his tender <HI>Mother.</HI> It there appears, he had a large Place in her Affection, as he well deserved; that her Heart and Expectations were much set upon him; and she remember'd him with lasting Sorrow. Tho' indeed she after comforted her self with her <HI>other hopeful Offspring,</HI> which GOD was pleas'd to raise up for Her in the stead of her beloved and deceased ABEL. For,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He is said to be</HI> DEAD. &mdash; And by the <HI>same Verse</HI> it seems, He deceased in his <HI>Youthful Age,</HI> without Posterity, and while unmarried.</P>
<P>Whither his <HI>Name</HI> was given him by his Parents at his <HI>Birth</HI> or <HI>Death,</HI> is utterly uncertain. If it were the former it seems to have been Prophetick: or at least his Dying in the Flower of Life was ex|actly answerable to the Meaning of it.</P>
<P>For ABEL is an <HI>Hebrew Word</HI> that in the <HI>Noun</HI> sig|nifieth <HI>Vain</HI> or <HI>Vanity</HI>; and in the <HI>Verb&mdash;He is Vain or Vanity,</HI> or <HI>vanisheth away.</HI> ABEL, says a Learn|ed Man, is as much as to say, <HI>a vain thing</HI>; i. e. ei|ther what has scarce any Being, or as a Puff of Breath out of the mouth of an Infant, quickly ceases and disappears <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pagnin</HI> &amp; <HI>Mercer</HI> Lexic.</NOTE>. It is the same Word which is so often used in Eccl. I.2. <HI>Vanity of vanities, vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</HI> For in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> it is &mdash; <HI>Abel Abelim, Abel Abelim, all is Abel.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003597_0046_0FF834D5839311D0">And as this is both here and elsewhere ascribed to <HI>All things under the Sun</HI> in General; so to the <HI>Children of Men</HI> in Particular, in diverse other Pla|ces. So Psal. CXLIV.4. <HI>Man is like to</HI> ABEL, which we render <HI>Vanity: His Days are as a Shadow that passeth away.</HI> So Psal. XXXIX.5. <HI>Behold! Thou hast made my Days as an Hand-Breadth, and mine Age is as nothing before Thee: Verily every Man at his best State is altogether</HI> ABEL; i. e. <HI>Vanity.</HI> And so at the end of the 11<HI>th</HI> v. <HI>Surely every Man is</HI> ABEL; or <HI>Vanity.</HI></P>
<P>The Word also signifies <HI>a Vanishing,</HI> and this <HI>very quickly</HI>; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Buxtorf</HI> Lexic Rab, &amp; <HI>Alberti</HI> Lexic Nov.</NOTE> as also a <HI>Breath</HI> or <HI>Vapour:</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Buxtorf</HI> &amp; <HI>Cas<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ellus.</HI></NOTE> And so I find the <HI>Syriack</HI> renders it in the three last men|tion'd Places. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Bib Polyglot.</NOTE> And perhaps the <HI>Apostle</HI> may allude to this when he says &mdash; Jam. IV.14. <HI>For what is your Life? It is even a Vapour, that appeareth for a little Time, and then vanisheth away.</HI></P>
<P>Just so did the promising Life of ABEL. He ap|peared as a Vapour; as visible and fair to the Eye as the rest of Men: But his Appearance here below was but for a little Season, especially compar'd with others: He quickly vanished: And his surprized and affected Parents had soon a sad Oc|casion to cry out <HI>Vanity</HI> on his Appearance with them, and on all the Prospects and Hopes he gave them of Comfort in him. They were vain &amp; empty things that were very gay and pleasant in their View, but quick expired and came to nothing.</P>
<P>His early Death was a very great and publick as well as private Loss, attended with many pungent
<PB N="4" REF="003597_0047_0FF834D7E4672B08">
aggravations, an heavy Stroke to his pious <HI>Parents,</HI> and bitterly lamented by them. And the <HI>De|cease</HI> of this their hopeful Son was no doubt the more affecting, as it was very <HI>sudden</HI> and <HI>sur|prizing</HI> to them. He went out Well: But he came not home at the time expected: But alass! instead of Him, came the amazing Tydings, that he was Dead, and vanish'd from their sight for ever.</P>
<P>And now as DAVID, at the Surprizing News of <HI>Absalom</HI>'s Excision, with an Anguish inexpressible, cried out &mdash; <HI>O! My Son Absalom! my Son! my Son Absalom! wou'd to God, I had died for Thee! O Absalom! my Son, my Son!</HI> So methinks we may hear our <HI>first Parents,</HI> at the amazing Tydings of the Death of <HI>Abel,</HI> with an equal Agony, cry out, in the forementioned words of SOLOMON &mdash; <HI>O! Abel Abelim! Abel Abelim! all things on Earth are vain and dead as Abel!</HI></P>
<P>And thus did our <HI>First Parents</HI> very early taste of one of the most bitter Fruits of their Sin and Fall. They must indeed die themselves in a little time: But before they come to this, they must find how evil a thing it is to forsake the LORD: They must meet with a great Variety of Griefs and Miseries: They must see the Triumph of Death over one of their dearest and most hopeful Offspring: They must needs <HI>First</HI> know what a grievous thing it is to be bereav'd of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Children; and what an exceeding bitter <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> they had in this respect pro|vided for their Posterity in all their future Gene|rations.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003597_0048_0FF834D970387B80">ABEL then was <HI>Dead</HI> even before his Parents, and in his <HI>Youthful Days.</HI> He quickly left them to be|wail their heavy Loss and Disappointment in Him, and to show the World the Lamentable Fruit of their Apostacy from the Blessed GOD.</P>
<P>But still</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>'Tis said, that He being</HI> Dead, <HI>yet</HI> SPEAKETH.</P>
<P>He was not only speaking after his Decease <HI>in the Days of his Surviving Parents,</HI> or in that Age that knew Him; but even also <HI>in the very Age wherein our Apostle</HI> writes concerning Him: <HI>He yet speaketh</HI>; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> or he being Dead, <HI>is yet a Speaking.</HI> And so he may be said to be, even <HI>to this very Day.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But how is</HI> ABEL <HI>said to</HI> Speak, <HI>when he is Dead and vanished?</HI></P>
<P>To this I answer&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">(1.) He speaks by the <HI>lovely Example</HI> of his pre|ceeding Life. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>De Dieu</HI> in <HI>Pol</HI> Synops.</NOTE></P>
<P>This is neither yet forgotten nor unrecorded. Tho' <HI>Abel</HI> be deceased; His <HI>living Example</HI> still survives him: It still subsists in the Minds of Men. And <HI>lovely Examples</HI> are the most <HI>speaking things</HI> that can be. They reprove our Vices; they charm us with their Virtues; and they very powerfully invite and urge our Imitation: and this not only while they live before our Eyes; but even as long as they are remembred by us.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="003597_0049_0FF834DB0166F2A0">(2.) He also speaks by the <HI>Mouths of Others</HI> who tell of his Virtues with Esteem and Honour.</P>
<P>He speaks as He is <HI>yet spoken of</HI> to his Commen|dation. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">, voce <HI>media</HI> vel <HI>passiva.</HI></NOTE> And so the Word is often used, both in the New Testament and other Writings. He not only lives in the grateful Memories of Men; But he is also conversant in every Mouth: they still speak of his living Virtues, and mention him with Praise. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Varii in <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">l</HI> Synops.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">(3.) and lastly, He significantly speaks even by <HI>his Death it self,</HI> and especially by the <HI>Earliness</HI> thereof.</P>
<P>He thereby plainly tells us, that neither Righte|ousness nor Youth, nor the Love, Desires or Pray|ers of the most tender Parents, can preserve us from it. That there is no Dependence on the Lives of the most desireable and hopeful <HI>Children:</HI> That even these may dye in <HI>Youth</HI> as well as others: But then 'tis wise and happy for them, that by a sober, righteous and pious Life they prepared for it, as ABEL did. In fine, that our Expectations from things below are vain; and when we expect most from them, we may be at once surprizingly disap|pointed: they may in a moment vanish, and all our fond and pleasing Hopes cut off for ever.</P>
<P>Such things as these, and many more, does ABEL speak, and is even yet a speaking by his early Death. He not only spoke them to the <HI>contemporary Gene|ration</HI> that surviv'd him, but even to <HI>Us</HI> who read and hear of his early Death and Virtues.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003597_0050_0FF834DE10F70C50">And hence we may by the way <HI>observe,</HI> of what advantage 'tis to put on record such affecting Histo|ries. The Speech of ABEL wou'd have been lost for ever as to <HI>Us,</HI> and we had never heard Him utter these profitable Lessons, if his virtuous Life and early Death had not been recorded.</P>
<P>But are there not <HI>Other Young &amp; hopeful Persons,</HI> who being Dead, yet speak as well as ABEL?</P>
<P>Yes alass! there are many such in every Gene|ration. There is a Cloud, a great Host, a Multitude of such affecting Speakers. They are continually going off and adding to ABEL'S Company: they unite in speaking the same things with him even to us: and as their Number still increases, their united Voice grows louder: and so we shou'd perceive it, if our Ears were not miserably deafened with the perpetual Noise of earthly Businesses and Clamours.</P>
<P>We therefore now proceed in the</P>
<P N="2">II. Place, to <HI>Those</HI> INSTRUCTIONS <HI>which our Text, in consort with like Instances in every Age, conspire to give us.</HI></P>
<P>And here are these three Things?</P>
<P N="1">1. It pleases the Sovereign GOD to favour and distinguish some of the Race of Men with <HI>Hopeful Children.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He yet sometimes takes them away by <HI>Death</HI> in their <HI>Early Days.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. and lastly, When they are Dead and vanish'd, yet they <HI>Loudly speak</HI> to their Survivours.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="003597_0051_0FF834E002EDF060">1. <HI>It pleases the Sovereign GOD to favour &amp; distin|guish some with</HI> HOPEFUL CHILDREN.</P>
<P>It would take up all our Time to run thro' all the Instances of this in Scripture. Nor is there any need in order to confirm our Observation. There have been Multitudes of Instances in every suc|cessive Age and Nation where the Gospel has been preached, even down to this very Day: and thro' the abounding Grace of GOD among us, our Eyes have often seen this particular Favour given either to Our selves or Others.</P>
<P>With the most humble Admiration, Let us briefly contemplate the Grace of GOD in this Affair: And while we do it &mdash; not to us, not in the least to us, but to Him alone ascribe the Glory.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Wicked Parents</HI> shou'd be like themselves, is so exceeding natural, that we can expect no other. For here there is both Inclination inwardly to move them, and Example outwardly to concur and draw them. And how can they help aspiring to copy after Those who appear to love and take care of them above all others; when they also find it to be their Interest to imitate &amp; please them, and this agreable to their own Propensities?</P>
<P>But alass! How many <HI>Parents</HI> eminent for <HI>Piety,</HI> have had the most pungent Sorrow of very <HI>wicked Children</HI>; notwithstanding all their Care and Pains, their Examples, Admonitions, Prayers, Tears, and every Method taken to induce them to be Religi|ous! &mdash; a most mysterious and afflictive Dispen|sation! &mdash; and there's scarcely any thing on Earth that can affect the Heart of Man with such Distress and Agony! And O! that the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>pious
<PB N="9" REF="003597_0052_0FF834E1F4F27D38">
Parents</HI> might be sensible of this &mdash; that if they have any Affection or Value for them, they wou'd not grieve and pierce the Hearts of those who love them as their own Souls, but rather do all they can to comfort them in this great matter.</P>
<P>I might easily inlarge on this ungrateful Subject. But I must hasten to consider, that thro' the Sove|reign Grace of GOD, some <HI>other Parents</HI> have been distinguished with <HI>Hopeful Children.</HI> And even in|deed some <HI>wicked Parents</HI> have had this surprizing Lot; but to their own confusion Here, if not their dreadful condemnation another Day. And this no doubt to show, that GOD is absolutely free &amp; so|vereign; that He is not confined to the Line of pious Parents, tho' He usually prefers it; but may choose and favour whom He pleases. He will be Gracious to whom He will be Gracious, and shew Mercy to whom He will shew Mercy.</P>
<P>However, to honour his pure Religion, and to encourage <HI>his People</HI> and their earnest Prayers, Hopes and Labours for their Children; He <HI>more frequently favours them</HI> than others with an <HI>hopeful Offspring.</HI> And if we heartily desire to have our Children Good; the most likely way is to be Good Our selves. By becoming Religious we happily bring them into the Covenant, which is the usual way of Grace: And by bringing them up in the Nurture of the LORD, and accompanying our earnest Prayers with our lovely Lives; we are most like to draw them both to admire and imitate our Vir|tues. The Blessed GOD is herein greatly pleased with us: and we therefore take the fairest Course to obtain his special Blessing for those pleasant Crea|tures whom we are training up to love &amp; serve Him.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="003597_0053_0FF834E3F3D184A8">Such <HI>pious Parents</HI> are therefore often favoured with an hopeful Offspring. GOD is pleas'd to en|courage them with a gracious Motive, <HI>Prov.</HI> XXII.6. And He usually grants his Blessing to their wise Endeavours. He commonly first inspires into the tender Children an <HI>high Esteem</HI> and <HI>dear Affection</HI> for their pious Parents: and this is the fruitful Source of every other Virtue. For this inclines them to admire their excellent Examples, to see the Goodness of their discreet Instructions, and in their Turns endeavour to be like them. The con|trary Speech and Carriage of the Vicious will from hence become disgustful: their Temptations will therefore loose their Influence: and the Youth will choose to imitate their more lovely Parents, to ob|serve their Counsels, and to grow more dear and delightful to them.</P>
<P>In short, the Language of their Parents is that in Prov. XXIII.15. <HI>My Son! If thine Heart be Wise; my Heart shall rejoyce, even mine: yea my Reins shall rejoyce, when thy Lips shall speak right Things! Hear thou my Son, and be Wise; and guide thine Heart in the Way! The Father of the Righteous shall greatly re|joyce; and he that has a wise Child shall have Joy of him: thy Father and thy Mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoyce.</HI> And as this is the moving Language of their pious Parents; the grate|ful Children are equally affected &amp; impressed with it. Inspir'd with a Desire to please them, they think they can never do too much to return their Love and to increase their Joy.</P>
<P>O delightful and hopeful Offspring! O happy Parents! Blessed are they that bare such Children! They are your Joy and Crown already: and they attract the Eyes and Love of others. They raise
<PB N="11" REF="003597_0054_0FF834E5E926F538">
our lively Expectations: They are the pleasing Hopes of the rising Age&mdash; To support Religion, and to serve their Country, when their Parents Heads are laid in the silent &amp; unactive Grave.</P>
<P>But O alass! How forward are our Expectati|ons! and how vain our Hopes &mdash; when in the</P>
<P N="2">II. Place, <HI>GOD sometimes takes away even such as these by</HI> Death <HI>in their</HI> Early <HI>Days.</HI></P>
<P>They are some of the most Desireable that we cou'd wish to Live, both for the Glory of GOD, and for the Good of the <HI>World.</HI> They are endow'd with excellent Accomplishments to serve their Gene|ration: and they have given a pleasing Specimen of what a useful Life they wou'd have liv'd, if they had continued longer. They have gain'd the Love of all about them: and we can't tell how to Think, but that all <HI>this Preparation</HI> is for a long Train of Service in Times to come.</P>
<P>But alass! when they have employ'd and spent their Younger Age to qualify themselves, are com|pleatly form'd for Business, and just are entering on the Publick Stage of Action;&mdash; They must Pro|ceed no further, They are taken away, and all their fine Accomplishments are lost to us for ever! They must only just appear, to show their Virtues, and raise our Hopes; and then must vanish! Their Days must be as <HI>Grass:</HI> Like the <HI>Flowers</HI> of the Field they must but open to our Eye and Flourish; and then the Wind blows over them, and they're gone, and the Place thereof shall know 'em no more.</P>
<P>The <HI>Places</HI> where they liv'd cou'd no more spare them than their <HI>Parents:</HI> The most ardent Desires
<PB N="12" REF="003597_0055_0FF834E774E07FC0">
and Prayers of their Friends &amp; Relatives for their precious Lives must be denyed: their earnest Ex|pectations must be disappointed: their Cares, Pains, Expences and Projections for them, must come to nothing: their pleasing Apprehensions of future Comfort and Delight on Earth, must vanish: and their most desir'd Enjoyments must, against the strongest Passions and Affections, be ravish'd from them. And even <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> this &mdash; while Multitudes of worthless and wicked Children, the Shame &amp; Sor|row of their Parents, and the Corrupters of their Age, are still continued. &mdash; <HI>O! the Depth of the Riches, both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of GOD! How unsearchable are his Judgments! and his Ways past finding out!</HI></P>
<P>Unbelief and <HI>Ignorance</HI> are upon this Occasion, ready to cry out &mdash;
<Q>LORD wherefore hast Thou made these hopeful Youths in vain? in vain a|dorn'd them for that Delight &amp; Love on Earth, which they are never to enjoy? in vain accom|plish'd them for that special Service Here, which they are never to Perform?</Q>
&mdash; Or <HI>may we hum|ly search into the deep and awful Mystery of this Di|vine Dispensation?</HI></P>
<P>What if this be only to give a Glympse of the ado|rable <HI>Sovereignty</HI> &amp; <HI>Perfections</HI> of that absolutely Bles|sed GOD; who can as easily &amp; in a moment make a World as not, to show his Glory, &amp; then in ano|ther moment make it vanish? So He causes the <HI>blaz|ing Meteors</HI> of the Heavens to brake out &amp; glare with an admired Brightness, to show his Power and raise our Wonder; and then in a moment vanish, and not leave the least Track of their Subsistence after them. So <HI>He bringeth the Princes to Nothing: He maketh the Judges of the Earth as Vanity&mdash; He blow|eth
<PB N="13" REF="003597_0056_0FF834E971948CF8">
upon them, and they wither: and the Whirlwind taketh them away as the Stuble.</HI> Isai. XL.23, 24.</P>
<P>Or, what if this be to show his boundless <HI>Fulness</HI> and <HI>Magnificence?</HI> That He has not any need or want of any Creatures, or their most excellent Powers to serve Him. So He every Day, in a most curious and amazing manner, Forms even Millions both of <HI>Brutal and Humane Creatures</HI>; whom again He crushes before the Birth, and never suffers to see the Light: that so with awful Reverence <HI>Others</HI> may clearly see that <HI>The Inhabitants of the Earth are but as Grashoppers</HI> to Him; that <HI>the Nations are as a Drop of the Bucket, and are counted as the small Dust of the Balance</HI>; yea that <HI>all Nations are be|fore Him as Nothing, and are counted to Him</HI> even <HI>less than Nothing and Vanity.</HI> Isai. XL.15&mdash;23.</P>
<P>Or what if all this be rather to give his <HI>People,</HI> both the <HI>Children</HI> and their <HI>Parents,</HI> a special <HI>Op|portunity</HI> for the glorious Triumph of their <HI>Resigna|tion</HI> to Him?</P>
<P>How hard a thing is it, for the lively <HI>Youth,</HI> that has just begun to taste of Earthly Delights, has his Relish strong, and his Prospects gay &amp; promising; in his very Entrance into These &mdash; to Resign his Life! &mdash; And this especially, if he be one of a reputable Birth, of raised Figure, that has a Store of Riches either in Hand or in Reversion, has the Respect and Love of all who know him, and all the pleasing Views that can be of Earthly Happi|ness. I might mention several other aggravations &mdash;such as having travelled abroad, and finish'd his Accomplishments, in a foreign Land, and about Returning to his dear &amp; longing Parents;&mdash; And <HI>Then</HI> to come into the Views of <HI>Death,</HI> and give up
<PB N="14" REF="003597_0057_0FF834EB64EB5EC8">
all at once! &mdash; O! how hard! &mdash; how diffi|cult!&mdash;</P>
<P>But if by the Grace of GOD, the Youth <HI>can do it,</HI> if he can offer up so dear a Sacrifice; O! how exceeding acceptable is this to the Sovereign GOD! How Glorious the Victory over Nature! What a wonderful and delightful Spectacle to the Holy <HI>Angels!</HI> With what Speed &amp; Pleasure will they transport the resigned <HI>Spirit</HI> to the Seats of Bliss a|bove! and with what abounding Joys &amp; Welcomes will it be received There! &mdash; Such a Sacrifice and such a Triumph is highly worthy of all that we can have to offer. It is most highly worth the while to have every Accomplishment &amp; Prospect, if it were for nothing else, that we might Dye in Youth, and have such a precious Offering to make to the Glorious GOD.</P>
<P>And for the same Reason, it is fully worthy of all the Affections, Cares, Pains, Expences, Labours, Desires and Hopes of the most tender <HI>Parents</HI>; that <HI>They</HI> may also have Occasion to Resign the dear and blooming Youth to HIM. It is worth the while to have such lovely Children, if it were for nothing else, that we might have such precious Things to yield up to Him: and the lovelier they are, and the dearer to us; the greater is our Tri|umph over our own Affection for them, the more Precious will He esteem our Present, and the more delightful is our Offering to Him.</P>
<P>Or lastly, what if all this be, <HI>To take us off</HI> from too much admiring and loving the nearest and pleasantest of Creatures; to remove our Depen|dance from them; and to raise our Minds up more to that <HI>Unchangeable, All-sufficient and most Glorious</HI>

BEING! Whom we can never love or admire e|nough, never enough depend upon: who can never fail or disappoint us; but will infinitely more than answer our most raised Expectations.</P>
<P>However, when the Clouds and Darkness that are round about the Throne of GOD, have come down and cover'd us, and cast an impenetrable Mist on these Transactions; we must yet fall down, admire, adore Him, for the surpassing Reach of his Intentions in them. We must yet Believe, that He orders all in perfect Wisdom: that in all the Myste|ries of Providence, He is ever wisely carrying on his Good and Great Designs in the most proper Ways: that His Covenant is well ordered in all things, and sure and everlasting: that He is ever mindful of it: and that He is all the while advanc|ing both His own highest Glory and His People's highest Interest, as the united View &amp; End of all.</P>
<P>But when our Hopeful Children Dye; Do they intirely vanish? Are they gone away into perfect Silence? Have they quite left off speaking to us, and this for ever?&mdash;<HI>O! no!</HI> &mdash; They are Dead indeed to all things here below, and are disappeared from the Sight of our Bodily Eyes: But</P>

<P>Did they resist Temptations, refrain the Company of the Vain and Wicked, and honour and esteem the Good; They thereby instruct &amp; quicken us to Do so likewise. Or were they full of Love and Duty to their Parents, chaste and sober in their Words and Actions, Fair and honest in their Deal|ings, Diligent in Business, Faithful in their Promi|ses, Kind and courteous to all about them; their Examples, teach us to Be so likewise.

<Q>O! I find that in Fearing GOD there is a great Reward, a glorious Recom|pence, inexpressibly transcending all that I could on Earth imagine!

<P><Q>By my self you see that you may Dye in Youth, notwithstanding all your airy Hopes &amp; Expecta|tions. Your Childhood and Youth are Vanity. Your Youthful Hearts are Evil, full of Evil, and this continually. You have many Youthful Plea|sures to Pursue, and many Youthful Lusts to Gra|tify. Alass! You are exceeding Prone to set the Evil Day of <HI>Death</HI> at a great Distance from you; and then to please your selves with the vain Presumption, that it is as far from you as you would have it: and then you freely give a Loose to Earthly Joys and Pleasures. But O Young Man!

<P><Q>It is but a little while since, I was as well as You; as full of Life, of Health, of Cheerfulness; as full of pleasant Prospects and Expectations: I had as much of Earthly Things in View as almost Heart cou'd wish: and I had as little Reason as any among you, to suspect that all these pleasing Scenes of Hope wou'd so soon be vanish'd &amp; come to nothing. Alass!

<Q>It is true indeed, Tho' GOD has pleas'd to shorten my Life on Earth; yet because I fear'd Him in my Youthful Age, I have lost nothing by it; but made an happy Exchange of Earthly Prospects for Heavenly Joys, and of uncertain Hopes for Satisfying Pleasures at the Right Hand of GOD for ever. And this is the wise &amp; only Course I wou'd now earnestly desire and counsel you to take for your Eternal Safety. O! Re|member now your Great and Kind CREATOR and REDEEMER, in your Youthful Days, before the Evil Days of Sickness or of Death come on you, or those distressing Times draw nigh when you shall say you have no Pleasure in them.

<Q><HI>My dearest Earthly Parents!</HI> weep not now for Me; but for your Selves, and for your re|maining Children! I have no Occasion now for Tears or Sorrows; and I am now above the need of Cries. I enjoy the Fruit of all your Cares, Ex|pences, Pains, your Faith and Prayers for me: I now reap their Harvest with a great abundance: They are infinitely more than answered. And as you offer'd them all to GOD, while you were bestowing them on <HI>Me</HI>; you have lost nothing by them; But as they all <HI>are turned to My Eter|nal Gain,</HI> They are likewise <HI>working out for You a vast Increase of Joy</HI> when we meet together.</Q></P>
<P><Q>O! Do not therefore mourn for Me, as if you had no Hope! But be exceeding Thankful for the Grounds of Hope GOD has been Pleas'd to give You. And now repair to the <HI>Everlasting Covenant</HI>; cease your flowing Tears; and Drink and be Refreshed with its abundant Consolations! O Take off your strong Affection from me, which I have now no need of; and lift up your Eyes and see That DIVINE PERSON cloath'd with <HI>Our Humane Nature:</HI> who is infinitely Fairer and more Lovely than any of the Sons of Men, and who Lives and Reigns for ever. See how He shines in this World of Light and Glory! and how all the <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Angels</HI> Here are ravish'd in Him! And Do You by Faith behold Him, till you forget your Sor|rows and loose the Sight of Things below!</Q></P>
<P><Q>And O! Let <HI>all my Relatives</HI> Prepare to Follow. Let them continually Remember that there is an inconceivably Happier World than That they Live in; And let it be their Great and constant
<PB N="23" REF="003597_0066_0FF834FE083C0840">
Care to make sure of it. Let them keep unspot|ted from that lower World in which they sojourn. Wherein I have failed in my Duty, either with respect to GOD or <HI>Man</HI>; Let them supply my Failings. Let them make <HI>Religion</HI> their chief Concern and Business. Let them serve <HI>their Ge|neration</HI> according to the Will of GOD. Let them Do all the Good they can. Let them study to be Blessings to all about them. Let their Light so shine; that Others <HI>There</HI> may Glorify &amp; Praise GOD for them; and that We may have continual Joy in Heaven among the Saints and Angels <HI>Here,</HI> from what They are Doing on Earth. Let them never be weary of Well-Doing. And let them continue Faithful to the Death; that they may obtain the <HI>Crown of Eternal Life,</HI> and We all may come to meet with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory <HI>Here</HI>; never to Part again, and never to Sorrow more.</Q></P>
<P>This is some of the awakening Language of our deceased <HI>Abel!</HI> Thus He speaks aloud to <HI>Us!</HI> He speaks from the <HI>Eternal World!</HI> Such things as These He pronounces by me, and wou'd with his own Voice Proclaim, were He now to appear a|mong us. And as He speaks by me &mdash; wou'd the SPIRIT of CHRIST accompany them with His own impressive Power; They wou'd become the Voice of CHRIST Himself; with a mighty Effi|cacy they wou'd Pierce into your Souls and make You Hear and Live.</P>
<P>O that we might give our <HI>continued Attention</HI> to them, and not Forget them as the airy Sound is now about to cease: But let us <HI>always hear it</HI>; i. e. Habitually Remember, that these Great and important things concern us every Moment of our
<PB N="24" REF="003597_0067_0FF834FF9450C670">
Lives, as much as we now think they Do, while we are Hearing of them in the House of GOD. And let us so Think of them, as by the concurring Help of the SPIRIT of Grace, we may be effectu|ally excited, To give all Diligence to make our Cal|ling and Election sure; that so an Entrance may be ministred to us abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our LORD &amp; SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>There GOD Himself appears in this WONDEROUS PERSON, and unveils His Glories, and converses with His People in the most immediate manner. There He fully shows Himself their GOD and <HI>Por|tion</HI>; and clears up every <HI>Mystery</HI> to their perfect Satisfaction. There no Impurity or Sin shall en|ter; and there is no more Death, nor Sorrow, nor Pain, nor Crying: But all this vast and gloomy Train of things are pass'd away; and in their Room succeeds, a perfect Life of Immortality &amp; unde|caying Vigour, an Eternal Stream of pure Delights, a Fulness of unmingled Joys, an absolute Assurance of their Perpetuity: And there all the Heavenly Hosts congratulate and triumph in their mutual Happiness, and unite in their Acclamations of Praise to GOD, the Free Original of all, for Ever.</P>

<HEAD>An ACCOUNT of the <HI>Deceased,</HI> From the <HI>Weekly News-Letter.</HI> Corrected.</HEAD>
<P><HI>BOSTON,</HI>
<DATE><HI>Septemb.</HI> 7. 1727.</DATE></P>
<P>ON the last Lord's-Day, the 3d Instant, arrived here Capt. <HI>Shepardson</HI> in about Seven Weeks from <HI>London,</HI> with the very sorrowful and surprizing News of the Death of Mr. DANIEL OLIVER, Jun. of the Small-Pox there: Which is greatly Lamented among us.</P>
<P>He was eldest Son of the Honourable DANIEL OLIVER, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of this Town. Was Born here on <HI>January</HI> 14. 1703, 4. Enter'd <HI>Harvard-College</HI> in 1718. Took his Degree of Batchelor in Arts, 1722. of Master in Arts, 1725. And applied himself to Merchan|dize; for which He had an excellent Genius and Ability. He set sail from hence for <HI>London,</HI> May 10. 1726. Travel'd into <HI>Holland, Flanders</HI> and Part of <HI>France,</HI> and returning to <HI>England,</HI> visited several Parts of the Kingdom: And having just finish'd his intended Travels, and Preparing to come Home; was taken ill on Monday <HI>June</HI> 26, Died on Wednesday <HI>July</HI> 5th, in the 24th Year of his Age, and was the next Day decently inter'd in a Vault under the Church in Fenchurch-street, <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>He was a Young Gentleman of great Hopes. Of a lively, active and pleasant Temper: Full of Duty &amp; Affection to his Parents: Modest, Free and Innocent in Conversation: Had preserv'd a blameless Reputation, and gain'd the Love of all that knew him in his native Country: And by diverse Letters we are well in|form'd, that by the Help of GOD He maintain'd his virtuous Cha|racter Abroad. One writes,
<Q>That in his whole Conduct He never saw any thing unbecoming the Christian: That He tho't He could plainly see the Advantages of a religious Education, which had made so good an Impression, that a Tincture of it run thro' all his Behaviour: That with Pleasure He observ'd the Stand He made against the Temptations and Wickedness of the Age &amp; Town: That from his being first taken Ill, He was much compos'd and in a good Frame, and continued so in his Intervals to the last: And that the Esteem He had gain'd when Living, was seen by the Respect shown him afterwards, being lamented by all his Acquaintance.</Q></P>
<P>In fine, His short Life was a worthy Example of a wise and virtuous Conduct, to the Youth of his native Country, both at home and abroad: and his immature Death is an affecting Instance of the Uncertainty of their Earthly Prospects and Expectations. And may they be so wise &amp; tho'tful as this Young Gentleman ap|pear'd to be, even in the Hight of his Health and Chearfulness. For the Evening before He was seiz'd, in Company with a Friend of his, He desir'd a Sermon might be read on those important Words of our LORD, in <HI>Mat.</HI> XVI.26. <HI>For what is a Man pro|fited, if he shall gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul? or what shall a Man give in exchange for his Soul</HI>? And in the Reading, Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI> made many just and serious Remarks, which his Friend writes word, He shall never forget.</P>

<L>PEnsive, o'ercome, the Muse hung down her Head,</L>
<L>And heard the fatal News, &mdash;"<HI>The Friend is dead.</HI></L>
<L>Dumb, fixt in Sorrow, she forgot her Song,</L>
<L>The Tune forsook her Lyre, the Voice her Tongue:</L>
<L>'Till, BELCHER, You command her Strains to rise,</L>
<L>You ask, she sings; You dictate, she replies;</L>
<L>That well-known Voice awakes her dying Fires,</L>
<L>And, instant at Your Call, the Pow'r inspires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then let our Griefs in mingling Streams descend,</L>
<L>You mourn the Brother, and I weep the Friend.</L>
<L>He's dead &mdash; O vast unutterable Woe!</L>
<L>Gone, gone for ever from these Seats below:</L>
<L>No more his gracious Lips our Souls shall move,</L>
<L>And lift us to the holy Joys above;</L>
<L>No more the Church his sacred Transports feel,</L>
<L>His strong Devotion, and his fervent Zeal;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="003597_0071_0FF82C3964F65B48">No more his Face shines with the conscious Calms,</L>
<L>Of Faith, and Pray'rs, and gen'rous Deeds, and Alms:</L>
<L>Ah! fainting, pale, ebbs out his quiv'ring Breath,</L>
<L>And OLIVER the good descends to Death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus while the Friends their private Loss deplore,</L>
<L>Lament unpity'd, unreliev'd, ye Poor,</L>
<L>Who, round his Gates, your daily Blessings paid,</L>
<L>Warm by his Cloaths, or from his Table fed.</L>

<L>Unknown, to see, and succour Humane Woes:</L>
<L>Invisible, he trod the homely Cott,</L>
<L>The Hungry eat, th' Opprest to groan forgot,</L>
<L>The Sick perceiv'd the sudden Cordial save,</L>
<L>All blest the Gift, nor saw the Hand that gave.</L>
<L>From Men, with Art and sacred Caution hid,</L>

<L>You painted Roofs, and pompous Rooms of State,</L>
<L>Where, in the Senate, the grave Patriot sate,</L>
<L>Say how his steady Conduct grac'd your Board;</L>
<L>Just were his Thoughts, and prudent ev'ry Word;</L>
<L>Serene, delib'rate, undisguis'd by Art,</L>
<L>His Tongue was faithful, and sincere his Heart.</L>
<L>Statesmen, th' unblemish'd Counsellor bemoan,</L>
<L>And from his fair Example form your own.</L>
<L>So must your Greatness sink, your Glories fade,</L>
<L>And, blended, in the common Dust be laid.</L>

<L>Mindless of Grandieur, from the Crowd he fled,</L>
<L>Sought green Retirements, and the silent Shade.</L>
<L>Ye bow'ry Trees, which round his Mansion bloom,</L>

<L>Nor in his Hands the blushing Fruits appear:</L>
<L>Yet is his Image in each Scene convey'd,</L>
<L>And busy Fancy forms his gliding Shade,</L>
<L>I seem to meet him in the flow'ry Walks,</L>
<L>And, thro' the Boughs, his whispering Spirit talks,</L>

<L>Grief seals my Lips, and Tears suffuse my Eyes.</L>
<L>O far, far off, above the Ken of these,</L>
<L>The rising Mountain, and th' aspiring Trees,</L>
<L>In the gay Bow'rs that crown th' Eternal Hills,</L>
<L>His spotless Soul, in deathless Pleasure, dwells;</L>
<L>Tuneful replies, while Choral Seraphs play,</L>
