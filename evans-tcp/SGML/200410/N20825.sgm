<L>Ten thousand dangers in his passage lay,</L>
<L>Dark was his night, and dreary was his day!</L>
<L>The rude companions of his bold design,</L>
<L>Fatigu'd with toil, against their chief combine:</L>
<L>When sudden&mdash;bursting on th' astonish'd view!</L>
<L>A world discover'd prov'd his judgment true.&mdash;</L>
<L>"Yet black ingratitude, the Great Man's fate!</L>
<L>"Pursu'd Columbus with envenom'd hate;</L>
<L>"But minds like his a base degen'rate race,</L>

<L>"The noble soul its energy maintains,</L>

<L>The sons of Europe found a guileless race,</L>
<L>No fraud was veil'd beneath the smiling face;</L>
<L>Their manners, mild, benevolent, and kind,</L>
<L>Pourtray'd the cloudless sunshine of the mind:</L>
<L>Bless'd in their Prince's patriarchal reign,</L>
<L>Whose pow'r reliev'd, but ne'er inflicted pain,</L>
<L>Their placid lives no fancy'd evils knew;</L>
<L>Their joys were many, and their wants were few.</L>
<L>One custom with their virtues ill agreed,</L>
<L>Which made Humanity with anguish bleed;</L>
<L>Compell'd at Superstition's shrine to bow,</L>
<L>The hapless victims of a cruel vow!</L>
<L>Their sweetest maids were often doom'd to prove,</L>
<L>No joy in friendship, and no bliss in love!</L>
<L>Yet love and nature cannot be supprest,</L>
<L>The sigh will heave, and palpitate the breast;</L>
<L>For spite of vows, which Heaven's wise laws disown,</L>
<L>Love sits triumphant on the heart&mdash;his throne!</L>
<L>And breaks those fetters bigots would impose,</L>

<HEAD>ACT I.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE I.&mdash;On one side of the stage a flight of steps, with a Portico leading to the Temple of the Sun.&mdash;In the back|ground the sea. Time, sun-rise.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Catalpo <HI>and Priests from the Temple, who range them|selves&mdash;then enter</HI> Orozimbo&mdash;<HI>they how to him as he passes.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE>OROZIMBO, <HI>prostrating himself to the sun.</HI></STAGE>
<P>SOUL of the universe, who from thy glittering throne beamest immortal splendour, as thou hast permit|ed the stars for their appointed hour to bespangle the veil of night, now o'erwhelm all manner of glories in the greatness of thy effulgence, and be once more welcom'd by thy devoted servants to delight and bless the world!&mdash;Catalpo, conduct hither the virgin destin|ed to receive a priestess' sacred office.</P>

<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rise, good Solasco.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solasco.</SPEAKER>
<P>I here present the darling of my age to be devoted to the service of our god. It will be worse than parting with my life to lose the comforts of her dear society&mdash;but the bright sun, our glorious deity, demands such excellence to be consigned alone to do <HI>him</HI> honour.&mdash;Pardon, my king, an old man's tears; but na|ture will not always, without a struggle, yield to duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou hast, indeed, devoted to thy god a precious treasure; but tell me, Cora, can thy youth|ful mind freely resign the livelier joys of social life, and rest contented in seclusion and tranquillity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cora.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father's will has ever sway'd my thoughts, from the first hour that infant sense cou'd learn obedi|ence:&mdash;Should he doom my death, his mandate would be met with equal resignation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thy pious mind, which knows to yield such duty to a father, will well befit the service of thy god.&mdash;But hear the sacred tenour of the law which binds a priestess to her duty.&mdash;Should the heart, to heaven devoted, become the prey of sacrilegious love, our law consigns it priestess, and the accomplice of her guilt, to instant death. Her parents and their offspring are pledges for her faith, and should her flight elude offended justice, their forfeit lives must expiate her erime. <STAGE>[Cora <HI>bows to the sun</HI>]</STAGE> Now to the altar, and record your vows; then, as our custom is, come forth to shine Queen of this festive day, the last you are to know exempt from sacred duty.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[<HI>Exeunt</HI> Cora, Solasco, <HI>and</HI> Priests, <HI>to the Temple.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE>[During the latter part of this scene the sun becomes ob|scured by clouds, and thunder and lightning issue from them&mdash;the sea much agitated.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Catalpo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great chief, behold what envious clouds obscure the glories of our god.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say, Catalpo, what mean these bodings! <STAGE>[A ship appears from behind a projecting rock.]</STAGE> And lo!&mdash;What monster's that, whose wings bear it buoy|ant one the watery main?</P>

let me pour forth a heart o'erwelm'd with gratitude. And now begin the important work which heaven has delegated to us&mdash;Erect the sacred banner of our faith.</P>

<SPEAKER>Alonzo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brave associates! join with me in praise of him, who hath atchiev'd what ignorance, with sapient shrug, and satisfied, benumbing prudence, derided as the chimera of a madman's fancy: falling at his feet, let us be proud in being first to pay due homage to such surpassing excellence.</P>
<STAGE>[They all kneel.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rise, rise;&mdash;rather, my Alonzo, in these arms receive my thanks, thou, next to heaven, my firmest friend. Ye men of Spain, let what has passed admonish you in what may be to come&mdash;keep in your minds the time when we had gained the course which shut out the eastern world; how you beat your breasts, oppressed with fear and superstition&mdash;How, with wo|manish tears, you bade adieu to life, and blubbered out a requiem for your souls; then embracing desperation instead of fortitude, I was to be your sacrifice; and this body, which has been your conductor to wealth and ho|nour, you would have given to the sea, and ignorance and cowardice would have triumphed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valverdo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty Sir, forgive us!</P>

<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Freely, good Valverdo&mdash;Let the man stand forth, who, at a time so fraught with peril, first discovered land.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, your Excellency, I am an English|man; and tho' we Englishmen, are an odd, whimsi|cal set of fellows, yet we generally contrive (and I trust ever shall) to keep a good look out a-head when our superior is in danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me your fortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>My name is Harry Herbert; I am de|scended from as respectable and independant an ances|tor as the world can boast,&mdash;an English yeoman; but the civil wars leaving my family little, which my im|prudence soon made less, I thought that, altho' King
<PB N="5" REF="027352_0009_0FD420E643571A40">
Henry was deprived of the honour of this enterprize, that did not preclude his subjects; so I shipped myself off for Castille, where I had just time and cast enough to fall a dozen times in love, and into other scrapes, before I had the honour of embarking on board your Excellency's squadron.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Herbert, thou dost honour to thy country.</P>

<P>Strangers, who seem to be above the race of mortals, instruct us how to honour you&mdash;If you be the children of the Sun, be|hold our priests, who with persumes and libations, will welcome you to his holy temple; or, if human, here are fruits to feed you, dwellings to shelter you, and garments to clothe you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Chief, you behold in us the children of mortality; but the power we serve, in his high mer|cy, has bestowed upon us superior gifts; thus, thro' unknown seas to brave the imperious surge, and to construct engines which can sweep thousands from the earth&mdash;But that Deity commands us to proclaim his name with peace&mdash;The King, our master, wishes to enrich thee and himself&mdash;This hardy metal, useful in all the purposes of life, he will exchange for those thy country may produce.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cora.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stranger, you wrong yourself, and hold me unskilful to distinguish, when you suppose desert like yours can pass unnoticed&mdash;Your praises of the hum|ble Cora, tho' they have caused no vain emotion, yet ever will the mind receive with pleasure, praise e'en unmerited, when 'tis bestowed by those who claim our admiration.</P>

<P>All that the warmest fancy can depict in the bright colours of ideal excellence, can never reach that exquisite perfection nature exhibits&mdash;how must I bless my happy fortune, that bore me to a clime which boasts an ornament like thee!</P>

<P>What new emotion rises in my breast&mdash;I fear to ask my heart from whence it springs.

<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is England a world?</P>

<SPEAKER>Nelti.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes; I suppose English women, arm'd with spears made of that pretty, hard iron, climb the mountains, and destroy the wild bull.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Destroy the wild bull! No, my dear; our English women find prettier amusement in encoura|ging the breed of horned cattle&mdash;the use of the pretty, hard iron is confined to the men, and no great favourite either; for I know many flourishers of spontoons, who have a cursed antipathy to cold iron&mdash;Who is that elegant creature you were conversing with?</P>

<P>I wish I cou'd make him love me&mdash;how do women in England gain their lover's hearts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Herbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generally by using them like dogs&mdash;for, when a woman studiously avoids looking at a man, abuses him on all occasions, and is kind to every one else, we naturally conclude they love each other to distraction.</P>

<SPEAKER>Columbus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alonzo, my wrongs were enviable&mdash;cap|tivity was triumph&mdash;When amidst the applauding shouts&punc; of thousands, I approached the royal presence, the suffering monarch shrunk from the sight, and threw his mantle o'er his face, crimsoned with shame; then raised me to his arms, still my pride sustained me: but when I beheld the beauteous Isabella, try to force from their dire grasp my galling chains, and on each wound drop a balmy tear, loyalty and love rushed on my soul, I embraced her royal feet, and gave her tears for thanks; then all the pride of pageantry was decreed, but my soul languished for the time, when, Orozimbo, I might thus again enfold thee, and restore to thee thy king|dom, freed from the gripe of ruthless tyranny.</P>

<SPEAKER>Orozimbo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Greatest of men, in firmest confidence of thy excelling virtues, I repose my people's safety.</P>

<L>OLD stories done&mdash;old times long since forgotten,</L>
<L>Like musty records, little read, and rotten,</L>
<L>Return we now, to periods sounder grown,</L>
<L>To happier days, and readings of our own;</L>
<L>Where'er we ope the book, the style is clear,</L>
<L>The int'rest charming, the conclusions, dear;</L>
<L>Our means are flourishing, our joys not scant,</L>
<L>Possess'd of every good, the heart can want,</L>
<L>Old tales of conquest, thrown on distant shelves,</L>
<L>We've little left to conquer&mdash;but ourselves:&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>An arduous task&mdash;and yet to do us right,</L>
<L>We lose no time in ent'ring on the fight;</L>
<L>Miss, scarcely in her teens, attacks Mama,</L>
<L>Already having routed <HI>sage</HI> Papa;</L>
<L>"I'm not a chit&mdash;I <HI>will</HI> turn up my looks,&mdash;</L>
<L>"I <HI>will</HI> wear powder, and I <HI>won't</HI> wear frocks?&mdash;</L>

<L>Pert Master Bobby too, releas'd from school,</L>
<L>Hectors at home, and early learns to rule;</L>
<L>The splendid stud, relinquish'd by his sire</L>
<L>In grand display, awaits the youthful Squire;</L>

<L>In married life, resolving each to drive,</L>
<L>A sweet contention keeps the flame alive;</L>

<L>Tho' old the legend whence his scenes he drew,</L>
