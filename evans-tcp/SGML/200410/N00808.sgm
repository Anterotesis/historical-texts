<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Have set forth this small <HI>Treatise,</HI> principally aiming at the benefit of my Country, wherein I hope I shall not prove Unserviceable: Books of this nature are much wanted, but much more the pract|ice. The method of this Book will I hope be extreamly pleasing; the bulk of other Books of this nature being so large, that they require much time to peruse, and money to purchase; of which two things, many persons desirous of Experience in <HI>Military</HI> Affairs, can spare neither. Though it be Peace in our Land at this day, yet we ought to prepare in Peace for Times of War. Intervals of time may herein be spent by Youth, and by the help of

I must ingeniously confess, that I am one of the meanest, both for Skill and Scholarship to have undertaken a work of this nature. To the <HI>Courteous</HI> and <HI>Skilful,</HI> into whose hands this may come, whose better parts will yield better fruits.

<HEAD>THE Compleat Souldier, Or, EXPERT ARTILLERY-MAN.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. By way of Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>THe first Rudiments of Education wherewithal a young Souldier ought to be conversant in, is first to learn the right use of his Arms, than which nothing can make a man more compleat, nor fit him to bear the Name of a Souldier; neither can a man whatever attain to the least part of the Art-Military (which concerneth Foot Souldiers) with|out the Handling and Managing of his Arms. How delight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul is it to those that
<PB N="8" REF="000971_0006_0FAE3A2A85F884C8">
can perform this first Part? And with what Ease, Courage and Safety, can they both defend themselves, and offend their Enemies? Whereon the contrary, the chiefest Arms (without Exercise) become not onely toublesome Burthens unto the unskilful Bearers, but oftentimes prove hurtful and dangerous, both to themselves and others: Therefore this ought to be considered by all, who intend any profici|ency in this part of the <HI>Art Military</HI>; that both with Art and Courage (in time of danger) Defend both their King and Country. It hath been the manner of all famous Generals to bring their Souldiers to perfection by Exercise: <HI>Vegetius</HI> saith vey well, <HI>It is not length of Life or number of Years, that teacheth the Art of War, but continual Discipline, and Exercise of Arms: Let a Souldier Serve never so many years, so long as he is Unexercised, he shall still be a raw Souldier.</HI> No man is born a Souldier naturally, one may more incline to War than another; but the skill cometh not without industry and pains.</P>
<P>Notable was the saying of <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> to his Muster-Master; <HI>Chuse you</HI> (saith he) <HI>Good Bodies, and I will make them Good Soul|diers:</HI> A strong Body is most requisite in a Good Souldier, to undergo the Labours

of War; but it is Exer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ise and desire to handle Weapons that giveth the perfect skill. Therefore as <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> being de|manded what was the first and principal thing in the <HI>Art Oratory:</HI> answered <HI>Action</HI>; what the second, <HI>Action</HI>; what the third, Action; so we may truly say, that in the <HI>Art Military,</HI> Exercise is not only the first, second and third principal thing to make a Souldier, but also all in all. I could have given you an account of the Exercise used in Ancient Time, and of the Victo|ries which have been obtained by a small number of men well Exercised, against a multitude Unskilful and Untrained: But that not being pertinent to my intent, and having too much transgressed already, I shall give next a touch upon the Definition of a <HI>Posture.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. The Souldiers place of dignity.</HEAD>
<P>THe noble Souldier being inquisitive after Honour is much desirous to un|derstand his place of worth and dignity&punc;
<PB N="21" REF="000971_0019_0FAE3A3960255308">
which he ever conceives to be as due to him as his Life: which was the reason that caused both the <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Generals to be so exact and curious in be|stowing Rewards upon all Valiant Souldiers who were deserving of the same, &amp; accor|ding to every Man's worth and Dignity, gave him precedence of place and com|mand over the others, that they might lead and direct them as occasion shall require there for.</P>
<P>First, Know that a File is a number of men, beginning at one Leader, and conti|nuing in order of followers to the last man; or from the first, which is termed a <HI>File-leader,</HI> to the last which is termed a Bringer-up.</P>
<P>For the number of a File, our present Discipline only allows four, though in ma|ny Towns in this Province, they allow six, so that there needs no further dispute con|cerning the number of a File.</P>
<P>Secondly, A <HI>Rank</HI> is a row of men com|posed of <HI>Files</HI> more or less joyned together&punc; as when one <HI>File</HI> is laid fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nkwiss to one another, standing shoulder to shoulder from the right-hand to the left.</P>
<P>Therefore the <HI>File leader</HI> ought to be the worthiest, because he not only commands his <HI>File,</HI> but makes the first on-set against his enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="000971_0020_0FAE3A3D8704A568">The <HI>Bringer up</HI> ought to be the second in place of honour, because he is the last man in the Field marching in the Reer, which upon all occasions he ought to defend.</P>
<P>The Half-file leader is the third in ho|nour, because he is the leader of the Reer-half-files upon their several Motions, as doubling the Front, either intire, or divi|sonal.</P>
<P>The last man (or Bringer-up) of the Front-half files, is the last man in Dignity; but when the <HI>Reer half files</HI> are commanded off, he hath the honour of defending the Reer.</P>
<P>So by this Geometrical Proportion, the whole Body is equivalent in skill &amp; worth, and as it were (and indeed ought to be) seconds the one to the other, so long as life indureth. And then it may be said of them, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> writeth of the holy Band of the <HI>Thebans,</HI> that it was never Beaten until the Battel of <HI>Cheraean</HI>; after which Battel, <HI>Philip</HI> the Father of <HI>Alexander</HI> Sur|veying the dead bodies, and coming to the place where these three hundred lay, all close mingled one with another, &amp; struck through with the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Pikes, he wondred greatly; but hearing that it was the Band of Lovers and belov'd he wept, and said, <HI>Evilly may they perish, that suspect

<ITEM>8 <HI>A Revally.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Tato, that is, to shut or make fast your doors, for when this is beaten, all per|sons ought to repair to their private rest, whether in Military Watches, or Garrison. A Revally is beaten in the Morning by break of day (I suppose it comes from the
<PB N="24" REF="000971_0022_0FAE3A420C877D30">
<HI>French</HI> word <HI>Reviller,</HI> to awake from sleep) at which times the Sub-Officers usually take off their Sentinels.</P>
<P>These two (I suppose) cannot be said to be points of War, but only private di|rections for a Watch or Garrison, the one to give notice at what time they ought to be at Rest, and the other to shew the time that the Gates should be set open, or the Watch break up.</P>
<P>Now as you may learn for what end these six several&punc; Beats of the Drum are made use of: observe <HI>Bariff,</HI> page 5.</P>
<P>First, by a <HI>Call,</HI> you must understand to hear present Proclamation, or to repair to your Ensign.</P>
<P>Secondly, by a <HI>Troop</HI> understand to Troop along to the place of Randezvouze or else where.</P>
<P>Thirdly, by a <HI>March</HI> you are to under|stand, to take your <HI>Open Order</HI> in Rank, to shoulder your Arms and to direct your March either quicker or slower, according to the Beat of the Drum.</P>
<P>Fourthly, by a <HI>Preparitive</HI> you are to understand to <HI>close</HI> to your due distance both in Rank and File, for skirmish, that so you may execute upon the first Command.</P>
<P>Fifthly, by the <HI>Battel</HI> or <HI>Charge,</HI> under|stand the continuation or pressing forward

<P>Sixthly, by a <HI>Retreat,</HI> understand an or|derly retiring backward, either for Relief, advantage of the ground, or for some poli|tick end; as to draw the Enemy into some Ambushment, or such like: So that for the <HI>Drum,</HI> it is the Voice of the Commander, the Spur of the Valiant, and the Heart of the Coward.

<P>The Drum is of Ancient Antiquity, and from age to age it hath been a fit Instru|ment for the Service of the Foot: And not only the <HI>Drum</HI> was thought a fit In|strument alone for the Foot, but they were allowed some other pleasing Instrument to delight and transport the spirits of the Souldiers; as the Flute, Harp or Pipe.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Corporals</HI> according to order giv|en them, are to dispose of the seve|ral <HI>Sentinels,</HI> and to have an especial care that they keep their <HI>Muskets</HI> Prim'd and Laden; which must often be observed by visiting of the several <HI>Sentinels,</HI> to see that all things be in due order &amp; with silence; to the end that the <HI>Sentinels</HI> may always be heard, as often as occasion may offer. The Office of every <HI>Sentinel</HI> after he is placed upon his duty, is to enquire of every Passenger or others that shall but stir, <HI>Who Comes there?</HI> Yea, though

<P><HI>The Round,</HI> Or, <HI>The Round Major,</HI> Or, <HI>The Grand Round.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sentinels</HI> by whom he passes should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lways rest their Arms, and never permit any whomsoever to come near them. When they draw near a Corps of Guard, the Sentinel shall ask him, <HI>Who comes there?</HI></P>
