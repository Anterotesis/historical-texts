<P>IT becomes those who feel them|selves going out of <HI>this World,</HI> (as I considering the Advances of Old Age which have overtaken me cannot but do) to think much of <HI>Another.</HI> For which cause most of the Subjects in|sisted on in my Publick Ministry for several of the last Years of my life, have been such as are proper for one that <HI>knows he must shortly put off his Earthly Tabernacle,</HI> and be gone into <HI>the World of Souls.</HI> Therefore have I of late<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> time Discoursed so Largely concern|ing <HI>Death,</HI> the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> the <HI>Day of

Iudgment,</HI> and of <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Eternal Life.</HI> Some of my Hearers having desired my <HI>Meditations</HI> might be Pub|lished by the <HI>Press,</HI> and some of them having Contributed towards the <HI>Im|pression,</HI> I have singled out these few <HI>Sermons,</HI> and have Perused and Cor|rected the <HI>Notes,</HI> which were brought to me from one who wrote after me in <HI>Short-Hand.</HI> If there is in these a greater Inculcation and <HI>Laxness of Style,</HI> than in such as have been all written with my own Hand, the <HI>Can|did Reader</HI> will Excuse it; nor will that make them the less Edifying to them whose Edification is Chiefly in|tended by them.</P>
<P>If <HI>Preparation for Death,</HI> and a greater Willingness to leave this Earth, and Holy Longings in the Hearts of Believers (and yet patient waiting for the Lords Coming) to be at <HI>Home</HI> with CHRIST in <HI>Hea|ven,</HI> shall in any measure be the fruit of what is written, my Labour therein is not in Vain.</P>
<P><PB REF="001321_0004_0FB2867BF91C1630">I knew an Aged and Eminent Minister of GOD, who for the space of Fourteen Years before his <HI>Death,</HI> continued Longing for his Dissolu|tion.

In the mean time, I desire to stay the Lords Leisure. But, Thou, O Lord, how Long!</HI> Thus that Holy Man did Express his Holy Desires. This brings to mind <HI>Austin's</HI> Devout Reflection on those words, Exod. 33.20. <HI>There shall no man see

<P>Old Mr. <HI>Iohn Dod</HI> (whom Mr. <HI>Ca|pell</HI> was wont to call <HI>Iohn the Divine</HI>) would be often Expressing his Long|ings to be in Heaven: And altho' some said to him, they did not like a Servant that would have his wages be|fore his work was done, that did not make him of another mind. Mr. <HI>Sy|drack Sympson</HI> speaks of a Good man who was ever and anon saying, <HI>I wish I were in Heaven.</HI> Unto those that blamed him, supposing he did not do well so frequently to wish himself there, he replied, <HI>Whether I do well in it or no, I am sure I wish I were there.</HI> Is it ill done for a Christian (with a Patient Submission to the Will of God) to wish he were in <HI>a World in which there is no Sin, and where IESVS CHRIST is to be seen in all His Glory? Ioh.</HI> 17.24. <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.23.

of the hands of his Enemies, he de|sired them not to do it; and the reason he gave, was, that he did ex|ceedingly desire to be with CHRIST. The Good LORD give to me more of those Desires, and grant that both the Writer and the Readers, may Rejoyce together in the Heavenly &amp; Eternal World. In the mean Time it is matter of the deepest Humiliation to me, That altho' I have (after a poor manner the Lord knows) been Preach|ing the Gospel (this Summer it will be) Fifty Years, I am not fully ripe for Heaven to this Day; For were I so, I should then be here no longer.</P>

<P>And Deliver them, who through Fear of Death, were all their Life-time subject to Bondage.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Apostle in this Context, shews why it was necessary that the Son of God should Assume Humane Nature; Namely, that He might be capable of Suffering and Dying for the Salva|tion of His People. If He had been
<PB N="2" REF="001321_0008_0FB28687BB48E528">
God only, He could not have suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red. Eternity cannot Dye. Therefore i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was necessary that the Son of God should become the Son of Man. In this with the preceding Verse, he mentions two very Blessed Effects of the Death of Christ.</P>
<P N="1">1. One is, That thereby the Devil is destroyed: <HI>He thro' Death has de|stroyed the Dev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI> Not that he is de|stroyed as to his Being, but only as to his Dominion.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Effect of Christs Death is in the words read, Nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, in that a Deliverance, a Salvation has there|by been accomplished. We may ob|serve in the words before us;</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The Subject of this Deli|verance: He has delivered <HI>Them</HI> sayes the Apostl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; that is to say, <HI>The Chil|dren of God.</HI> He had before spoken of Christ as saying to God. <HI>Here am I, and the Children thou hast given to me.</HI> Those Children whom God has given to Christ in the Covenant of Redemp|tion, <HI>Them</HI> hath He Delivered.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> He shews what they are
<PB N="3" REF="001321_0009_0FB2868AB7C92890">
Delivered from: <HI>They are Delivered from Bondage.</HI> They were by the Curse of the Law in Bondage; bound over by the Law to suffer Death, not only Temporal but Eternal. But they are delivered from Eternal Death, and from the Curse of the First Death too. That Death is more obnoxious to them, than they are unto it; for by means of the Death of Christ it is a Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quered Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Here is the Reason of that Bondage which they had been subject to&punc; and are delivered from&punc; viz <HI>The con|tinual Fear of Death, that held them, that bound them.</HI> Men who know that Death is their Enemy, and it is im|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ble for them to avoid that Ene|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; must needs have many sad Re|flections &amp; Fears in their minds about it. But this Believers on Christ ought not to have.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE. That the Children of God are Delivered from that Bondage, which through the Fear of Death Christless Sinners are subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct unto.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001321_0010_0FB2868C81C32048">The Doctrine may be Cleared in Four Propositions.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That Death is a Formidable Evil.</HI> To Nature it is so. Altho' there are those in the world that through Faith and the Fear of God, are carried a|bove the fear of Death; Nevertheless, tis in it self considered a Formidable Evil; and is therefore called, <HI>The King of Terrors,</HI> Job 18.14. It exceeds o|ther Evils as much as a King exceeds other men. It is a most terrible thing: Job 24.17. <HI>They are in the Terrors of the shadow of Death.</HI> Look as there is nothing to Nature more pleasing and desirable than Life: Eccl. 11.7. <HI>Light is sweet</HI>; That is to say, the light of Life, that is sweet to Nature; and sayes <HI>Solomon, It is a pleasant thing to behold the light of the Sun</HI>: His mean|ing is, to live here in the world; For when men are in the dark Grave they behold the light of the Sun no more. So on the other hand, to be deprived of Life, to be subject to Death is the most unpleasant &amp; undesirable thing to Na|ture
<PB N="5" REF="001321_0011_0FB2868FEA00AB98">
that can be. And therefore it is that men Naturally do choose any thing rather than Death: Job 2.4. <HI>All that a man has will he give for his L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fe.</HI> Men had rather be Poor than Dye, rather be Sick than Dye; they had rather Live miserably than not at all: So then Death is a Formidable Evil.</P>
<P>The Enquiry may be, <HI>Whence is it so?</HI> How does it come to pass that Death is thus Formidable, that the thoughts of it does cause Fear and Dread to be upon the spirits of men naturally?</P>
<P>Answ. 1. <HI>A Cruel Enemy has by the Righteous Iudgment of God the Power of Death.</HI> The Devil is a Bloody E|nemy: In <HI>Rev.</HI> 12.3. he is called <HI>a Red Dragon,</HI> because he is a Bloody Devourer: And he has the Power of Death. And therefore the Jews of old were wont to call him by the name of <HI>the Angel of Death.</HI> The Angel that kills men they called by the name of <HI>Asmodaeus,</HI> which signifies a <HI>De|stroyer</HI>; and so does the Scripture call him by the same Name; 1 Cor. 10.

a Storm; he had power to inflict a sore Disease on the Body of <HI>Iob,</HI> but yet could not take his Life away from him, which fain he would have done, when he said to God, <HI>all a man has will he give for his Life.</HI> God said, <HI>he is in thine hand, but spare his Life.</HI> He is said therefore to have the Power of Death for two Reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In that it has been through his means that Death has come on the Children of men.</HI> The Devil has killed all the men in the world; he has been the Death of all the men in the world, namely by drawing them into Sin. No man had ever Dyed if it had not been for Sin. The Devil brought Sin into the world &amp; so Death: He was the first Sinner that ever was, and he caused the first Man that ever was to Sin; and in so doing he Killed him. Yea he Murdered him in the day he caused him to Sin. Therefore Christ sayes, Joh. 8.44. <HI>The Devil is a Mur|derer from the Beginning</HI>; because he Murdered the first Man by introducing Sin into the world: And did then
<PB N="8" REF="001321_0014_0FB2869576B036B0">

<P N="2">2. <HI>He is said to have the Power o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Death, because of his being an Executi|oner.</HI> He does by the permission and appointment of the Sovereign Judge of all the world, Execute Death o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the sinful Children of men.

Angels were the Instruments of the Providence of God in this Destruction. Now this adds to the Terror and Af|frightment of Death. It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of a mer|ciless Executioner. When <HI>David</HI> was doubtful lest he should fall into the hands of his inveterate Enemies, from whom he could expect no mercy, he said, <HI>The Terrors of Death are fallen upon me, Fearfulness and Trembling are come upon me, and Horror hath over|whelmed me,</HI> Psal. 55.4, 5. This must needs be a frightful thing. As <HI>Saul</HI> when he was told he should be with the Devil the next day, <HI>he was sore afraid, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell down on his face on the Ground.</HI> He swooned away with the Fear and Horror of it. This is one Reason why Death is so frightful to Sinners.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Death is a Sign of the Anger of God.</HI> It is a sign that man by Sin hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ransgressed His Law, and so incurr'd His Displeasure.

Body becomes subject unto a dismal Change. The Beauty of the Body turns into Blackness and Deformity. There was a Personable Young Man urged to have his Picture drawn; he refused it, but said to his Friends, I give you leave to do it after I am Dead a few dayes.
