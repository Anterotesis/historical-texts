<HEAD>An Humble WARNING From the Presaging EARTHQUAKE <DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 8. 1692.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>PLague, Fire and Earthquakes are amongst the most terrible Judgments, whereby the great and holy God doth manifest his sore displeasure against a sinful People, and his indignation and hatred of their heinous and crying Sins. <HI>These three</HI> have befallen <HI>London.</HI> The <HI>first</HI> in the GREAT DYING Year, 1665. the <HI>second</HI> in the GREAT BURNING Year 1666. and the <HI>last</HI> in the GREAT TREMBLING present Year 1692. and the Month of <HI>September</HI> is remarkable in all these. The <HI>Plague</HI> (as I remember) being then at the highest, the great <HI>Fire</HI> began on <HI>Sep|temb.</HI> 2. and the <HI>Earthquake</HI> was on the Eighth of the same Month; on which day of the Month <HI>Josephus de bel. Jud. lib.</HI> 7. <HI>cap.</HI> 18. writes thus; Jerusalem <HI>was taken the second year of</HI> Vespasian's <HI>reign on the eighth day of</HI> September, <HI>and having been already five times before surprized, it was finally again destroyed.</HI> This was <HI>London's</HI> trembling, but
<PB REF="000634_0004_0FA962F7C8C16CB0">
(through the great Power Patience and Mercy of God) not its falling day.</P>
<P>I call <HI>Earthquakes presaging</HI> for these Reasons; what weight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s in them I leave to others to judge.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Because Christ did assert them to be such</HI>: Luk. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> 5. to 12. <HI>as some spake of the Temple, how it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dorned with goodly stones, and gifts he said, As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> things, which ye behold, the days will come in, which there shall not he left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down</HI>; they asked, <HI>Master, When shall these things be? and what sign</HI> will <HI>there be when these things shall come to pass.</HI> Then Christ gave (amongst others) Earthquakes as foregoing Signs of such future Ruins.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Because God hath made use of Earthquakes (in former times) as forerunners of great Calamities to come.</HI> So according to Christ's prediction, this Sign went before the destruction of the Tem|ple. <HI>Josephus de bel Jud. Lib.</HI> 7. <HI>c.</HI> 12. Amongst the foregoing Signs of the destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> mentioneth an Earthquake: <HI>Vpon the Feast-day of</HI> Pentecost, <HI>at night the Priests going into the inner</HI> Temple <HI>to offer their wonted Sacrifice, at first they f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lt the place to move and tremble, and afterward they heard a voice, which said, Let us depart hence.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Because Christ saith</HI> (as of other Judgments mentioned, so) <HI>of Earthquakes, They are the be|ginning of Sorrows.</HI> If the beginning, must not o|thers follow? when an Earthquake is the begin|ning (let not Scorners deride) who knows what shall be the middle and the ending of those Cala|mities, that might take their beginning from an Earthquake, <HI>Matth.</HI> 24.7, 8.</P>
<P N="4"><PB REF="000634_0005_0FA962FAA988C448">4 <HI>Because I Judge</HI> (if I err, let my mistaking thoughts be excused) <HI>that this late Earthquake was from the immediate hand of God.</HI> And yet if it were not, God can use the alleadged Natural Causes of Earthquakes, to give warning and to fore-run o|ther following Miseries. But my reason is this, because it did extend it self so far, to so many pla|ces in <HI>England,</HI> and beyond the Sea (according to the Account I have heard) not only on the same day, but at the same time of the day as in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, at <HI>London, Sheerness, Sandwich, Deal, Maidstone, Portsmouth,</HI> and many other places beyond Sea, at <HI>Paris, Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">sailles,</HI> and in <HI>Normandy,</HI> at <HI>Brus|sels, Cologne,</HI> and in most places of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anders</HI>&punc; Now if it did arise from Natural Cau|ses, there must be exceeding great quantities of such Vapours in the Caves and hollow Places of the Earth, which striving all along so far to get out, it seems very strange they did no where with great fury break out, to the opening of the Earth, and overthrow of some places, where the Earth was weakest. If the quantity was less, taking its be|ginning in some certain place, and proceeding for|ward, seeking to get out, but could not, it would have required more time to travail under ground to such distant Towns and Cities, as in <HI>England,</HI> and so many places beyond Sea, and so could not have been at all, at the same time.</P>
<P>And if it were from the immediate hand of God was it not for some great end that God should do so great a work, which he doth more rarely do? Is not the meaning of it, a warning to all that have been shaken by it, to forsake sin, and turn to God by repentance and reformation, or else look
<PB REF="000634_0006_0FA962FC3A4FD370">
for some other stroke? while we go on in a course of great provoking sins, when God hath shaken his Rod over us, might we not fear it will some time fall upon us? But whether it were natural or Supernatural, should not all places that trembled by it, without Reformation, fear and tremble at the Judgments that may follow it? when God be|gins to punish, and Men not so much as begin to repent and turn, doth not he threaten he will go on to punish seven times more, and seven to that? and many times seven more to that? when a Peo|ple still walk contrary to him? <HI>Lev.</HI> 26.15. to 40.</P>
<P>Some would fain deny the matter of Fact, but that there are so many Witnesses to testifie against them. Some that own it, make light of it, and do not at all think it portends any more Calamity to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word">, even as the blinded <HI>Jews</HI> slighted all the In|dications of more approaching Miseries, as <HI>Josephus</HI> writes concerning them; saying, <HI>These miserable people were easily perswaded to believe Impostors who did bely God, yet would they not believe, nor give any ear or regard unto certain Tokens and Signs</HI> (of which an Earthquake was one) <HI>of the ruin of their City: but as it were blinded, neither having Eyes nor Souls, they counterfeited themselves, not to see what God foreshewed them.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' I dare not undertake to tell what particu|lar Judgments (which are at God's ordering) this Earthquake doth presage, without Reformation; yet may I not ask this <HI>sober</HI> Question, If this late Earthquake have not good effect upon our Hearts and Lives, may we not fear lest those Judgments may follow, which we read in Scripture God hath sent upon a People for those very sins which do
<PB REF="000634_0007_0FA962FC4AE0F150">
raign amongst us? as for prophaning his Sabbaths, for excessive Pride in Apparel, for profane Swear|ing, fulness of Bread, Drunkenness, Whoredoms, Robberies, Murders, Contempt of Religion, Ha|tred of Godliness, Divisions, and hating one ano|ther, neglect of Religious Education of Children, banishing the Worship of God from our Families, Blaspheming and Cursing, instead of Calling upon God, Lukewarmness, and a general decay of the Power of Godliness, Leaving of our first Love, loss of the Spirit of Prayer, yea (a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sinful Age) deriding of it, Apostacies, and Worldliness, Selfish|ness, and abuse of God's holy Ordinances, prosti|tuting them to Carnal Designs and Interests; and many more. That Scripture (amongst many, <HI>Isai.</HI> 3) may serve for a Glass to see our sins, and what Judgments we may fear, if they be continued in; which are sins that bring Kingdoms and Cities to ruin. Verse 8. <HI>For</HI> Jerusalem <HI>is ruined, and</HI> Ju|dah <HI>is fallen, because their tongue and their doings are against the Lord, to provoke the Eyes of his Glory.</HI></P>
<P>O that Magistrates (<HI>Nehemiah</HI> like) would not any longer suffer the Sabbath to be openly profaned, or things exposed to Sale in <HI>Londons</HI> (late trembling) Streets, or Parts adjacent, nor in the Land. Where is <HI>Nehemiah's</HI> Courage? Neh. 13.15. <HI>In those days saw I in</HI> Judah, <HI>some treading Wine-presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in Sheaves, and lading Asses: as also Wine, Grapes, Figs,</HI> [and now in our Street-trade, Apples, Pears, Plumbs, <HI>&amp;c.] on the Sabbath-day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold Victuals.</HI> Verse 17. <HI>Then I contended with the Nobles of</HI> Ju|dah, <HI>and said unto them, What evil thing is this that
<PB REF="000634_0008_0FA962FD6C5837F8">
ye do, and profane the Sabbath day? Did not your Fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this City? yet ye bring more wrath upon</HI> Israel <HI>by profaning the Sabbath.</HI> Verse 21. <HI>The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> I testified against them, and said unto them, if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the Sabbath day.</HI> O that after such shakings of the City, such things might be done no more on the Sabbath day.</P>
<P>O that no more Oaths on other days might be heard in our Streets, and no more reesings by Drunkenness there, least the Earth reel under us again. O that there might be praying to, and praising of God in all Houses that did shake, and yet do stand. That all Men, of all Ranks, Cal|lings, Qualities, Rich and Poor, Magistrates and Subjects, Ministers and People, Parents and Chil|dren, Masters and Servants, might search the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> hearts and ways, see what is amiss, and mend it, what is good, and continue and grow therein, that God may be no more provoked, dishonoured, in|censed against us, but glorified, pleased, feared by us, that his Anger might be turned away from us, that instead of Judgments and Wrath, his Blessings and Mercies might be poured upon us. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WOnderful, many wonderful things are done by the Lord of Heaven and Earth, by reason whereof his People may in triumph, and the Wicked in terror say, <HI>Who is like unto thee, O Lord, amongst the gods</HI> (or mighty ones) <HI>who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, working wonders?</HI> sometimes in the Heavens over our heads; sometimes on and within the Earth under our feet: In <HI>both</HI> the works of God have been so amazing, that night fill the In|habitants of Heaven above, and of the Earth be|neath, with admiration of his Divine Perfections.</P>
<P>First; God's works have been astonishing in the Heavens over our Heads, which because they are too high, and above <HI>our present Theme and Subject,</HI> I shall but briefly mention <HI>three</HI> of them, and
<PB N="2" REF="000634_0010_0FA962FE927C3938">
those concerning the Sun, the great inlightner of this Earth whereof we are to speak</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The standing stil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Sun.</HI> It is the Doctrine of <HI>Aquinas,</HI> That <HI>Motion</HI> doth as much belong to the Nature of Heaven, as <HI>Immobility and Rest</HI> to the Nature of the Earth. The Earth is a setled, fixed Body, and therefore it is an act of mighty power in God to <HI>shake</HI> it, and to make it move: but the Sun is as a Bridegroom coming out of his Chamber, rejoycing as a strong man to run a race, according to the ordinary Law of Creation and Government in continual motion, and therefore a mighty work of God alone to cause its motion to cease and stand still. The making of the Sun to stop, which naturally cannot but move, and cau|sing the Earth to shake and move, which naturally cannot but stand still, is an effect of equal power. The command of God doth change the Earths station into motion, and the Suns motion into standing still. Josh 10 12. <HI>Then spake</HI> Joshua <HI>to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the</HI> Amorites <HI>before the Children of</HI> Israel, and he said in the sight of <HI>Israel, Sun stand thou still upon</HI> Gibson, <HI>and thou Moon in the valley of</HI> Ajelon. Verse 13. <HI>And the Sun stood still, and the Moon stayed until the People had avenged themselves upon their Enemies. So the Sun stood still in the midst of Heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.</HI> Verse 14. <HI>And there was no day like that, before it or after, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man, for the Lord fought for</HI> Israel. Where is observable, (1.) That <HI>Joshua</HI> spake first to the Lord, and then to the Sun; for it was not <HI>Joshua</HI>'s voice, but God's power that put a check to the motion of the Sun. (2.) God hearkened to the
<PB N="3" REF="000634_0011_0FA962FF6CD49FA0">
voice of <HI>Joshua,</HI> praying that the Sun might stop its motion (3.) Then the Sun hearkened to the voice of <HI>Joshua,</HI> so that by God'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> commanding voice, in answer to <HI>Joshua</HI>'s praying voice, <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Sun stood still</HI>: If all the men on Earth with one con|current voice, should say to it, Sun stand thou still, it would still go forwards in its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">: so that its cessation from motion demon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rated the mighty a|mazing work of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> motion of the Sun,</HI> or its going backward, is no less a wonderful work of God in the Heavens than its standing still. The motion of the Sun is naturally progressive, or going for|ward, and if it should make more haste by many degrees in its diurnal Motion, it must be by pow|er Divine, and not Humane; yet in the apprehen|sion of men, it is a greater thing, that it should go backward, and would c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">use more their observation of its motion, and amiration of God's power, Isai. 38.7. <HI>This shall be a sign unto thee from the Lord, that the Lord will do this that he hath spoken.</HI> Verse 8. <HI>Behold I will bring again the shadow of the degrees which is gone down in the Sun-dial of</HI> Ahaz <HI>ten de|grees backward. So the Sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down. Hezekiah</HI> prayed, God promised, gives him a sign for his assurance of the performance, and the sign (tho' miraculous) was effected, and the mercy asked, was bestowed: God caused the Sun to go backwards to confirm the faith of his People in his Promise that his work for their deliverance should go forwards.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That at and from high noon-day till three in the afternoon, the Sun shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d give no light,</HI> but darkness should be at the usual time of its inlightening the

When the <HI>Lord of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ory,</HI> the <HI>Sun of Rig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">usness</HI> was crucified, the Sun hid i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s face, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Heavens put themselves into mourning at his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Matth. 27 45. <HI>Now from the sixth hour there was da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ss <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver all the Land until the ninth hour.</HI> This was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n extraordinary and miraculous work of God, upon the Reasons usually alleadged (1) Because it was the <HI>full of the Moon,</HI> which caused a gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <HI>Phi|losopher</HI> to cry out, <HI>Either the God of Nature suffers, or the Frame of Nature dissolves.</HI> (2.) Because (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s some affirm) it was <HI>universa,</HI> over all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Or (3.) according to others, because it was only over the <HI>Land of Judea,</HI> all other parts of the World having the benefit, and enjoying the light of the Sun at that time, which some judge to be the more strange: that as when <HI>Israel</HI> had light in <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> the <HI>Egyptians</HI> were under the Plague of Dark|ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> so at the crucifying of <HI>Christ, Israel</HI> which dwelt in <HI>Judea</HI> should be under darkness, when the World besides enjoyed light. Thus it is manifest that God doth great things in Heaven above; the Sun moves or standeth still, goes backwards or forwards, shines not, to give light at noon day, &amp; for some hours together unto the Earth at all, or else makes light in one part, when it doth not in another; and all this at the pleasure of the great God. But our present Task is to observe one ex|traordinary work of God, <HI>on and in the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; There is the amazing, mighty work of God on and within the Earth, which in the Text that suits the occasion, is <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>shaking of, and making

it to tremble</HI> before him, and under men that dwell upon it</P>
<P>This moving of the Earth is far different from that constant motion that some Philosophers ascribe unto it, for amongst the several <HI>Systems</HI> of the World which <HI>Astronomers</HI> have invented, <HI>three</HI> are more fa|mous, the one by <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> the other by <HI>Copernicus,</HI> and the third by <HI>Tycho B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ache. Copernicus</HI> following the <HI>Pythagoreans,</HI> assert the motion of the E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">rth, and the Sun to be in the Center of the World, without motion, that the Earth hath two moti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ns, one <HI>Di|urna,</HI> which is performed about its own <HI>Axis,</HI> in the space of 24 hours, and from this motion do arise our days and nights: the other <HI>Annua,</HI> whereby it is carried about the Sun, from the West towards the East, according to the Succession &amp; Signs of the <HI>Zodiack.</HI> Where then is the <HI>Miracle of the Suns stan|ding still</HI> in <HI>Joshua's</HI> days, if it stand still in all Ages&punc; Where is the Wonder of the Earths moving, if it whirl about every 24 hours with so swift a motion? Why cannot all people discern this constant motion of the Earth, that do perceive its shaking for a few minutes, and are so much affrighted at it? Are the <HI>Pillars</HI> of the Earth turned into <HI>Wheels</HI>? Some have denied all motion, some affirm too much&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> as when all motion was denied, a <HI>Philosopher</HI> to prove it, rose up and walked; so when the constant daily, and yearly motion of the earth is asserted, we may know by our Senses that it stands still, but these great men of Reason (so they are) will give you this presently for an <HI>Axiome, Sensibus non est Fi|dendum,</HI> you must not believe, nor trust your Senses which yet for the sake of the Doctrine of <HI>Transub|stantiation, I</HI> should not readily receive; but know|ing

When sinners upon Earth do not, the Earth under them may quake and tremble: and if while the Earth trembles <HI>un|der them,</HI> they then tremble <HI>upon it,</HI> yet when the Earth stands still again, they <HI>run</HI> as fast to sin a|gain, as they did before: when the Earth ceaseth its trembling, they do not cease their sinful moti|ons. The great <HI>Pillar</HI> that supports the Earth, whereby it stands so fast, is the <HI>power of God,</HI> for <HI>he hath hanged it upon nothing,</HI> Job. 26.7.

<P N="2">2. <HI>The greatness of this motion,</HI> or <HI>shaking of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">:</HI> There was a <HI>great Earthquake.</HI> Its great|ness is set forth by the greatness of its <HI>Effects</HI> and <HI>Consequents</HI> here named: As,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>shaking of the foundations of the Prison.</HI> The strongest Prisons, the most impregnable Pla|ces, Houses built with brick and stone, being foun|ded on Earth; when the one doth quake, the foun|dations of the other must needs be shaken: In ex|ceeding strong winds and tempestuous storms, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Houses may shake, and rock to and fro, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ile the <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">undations</HI> stand firm and are not mov|ed; but when the Earth it self, on which they stand, doth quake, their foundations are also sha|ken, and tho' your Houses then stood, yet they stood trembling, foundations, floors and roofs to|gether.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The immediate opening of the doors.</HI> Prison-doors, especially upon a strict charge given to the <HI>Jaylour</HI> for the securing of his Prisoners, are fast locked, securely barred and chained; but God did cause such an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> that no Locks could hold them fast, no Bars nor Chains could keep them shut; for at the arising of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s <HI>Earthquake,</HI> immedi|ately all the Prison-doors were opened.</P>

<P N="3">3. In the words are expressed the <HI>sudednness of this Earthquake.</HI> An Earthquake is sometimes quickly caused, and quickly ceased at the pleasure and the will of God. <HI>God spake, and the Earth stood fast,</HI> Psal. 33.9. God speaks, and he makes it quake and tremble.</P>
<P>Tho' it is one Doctrine chiefly intended to suit the <HI>occasion,</HI> yet I will briefly mention more, which will not be altogether alien from our design.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="doctrine">

<P><HI>God many times works wonders for the deliverance of his suffering Saints in order to the propogating of the Gospel. Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> imprisoned because they did preach, God by an <HI>Earthquake</HI> sets open the Pri|son doors that they may go forth and preach. They by preaching did make the Devil's Kingdom shake; they for preaching were fast bound in Prison; the Earth where they did lie so bound, falls a quaking under them, as being weary of the burden of impri|soned Preachers, and doth not rest, and could not stand still under them, till they were enlarged and set at liberty.</P>
<P>God <HI>can</HI> do wonders for the deliverance of his suffering Servants, of this his Almighty Power is a proof. God can deliver his Sufferers after such a manner, as none other can, their Enemies being Eye-witnesses and Confessors of it. <HI>Dan.</HI> 3.28. <HI>Then</HI> Nebuchadnezzar <HI>spake and said, Blessed be the God of</HI> Shadrach, Meshach <HI>and</HI> Abednego, <HI>who hath sent his Angel and delivered his Servants that trusted in him, and changed the King's word, and yielded th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">

<P>Doct. II. <HI>God needs not length of time to do the most great and wonderful works. Suddenly</HI> there was an <HI>Earthquake.</HI> God can make it move in an instant. When its said God in <HI>six</HI> days made this World, it's not to be understood that he did need so many days to make it in. It was his pleasure to take that time to finish, beautifie and compleat it. When God did create the Earth, and brought it out of nothing, it was <HI>suddenly</HI> done. He did but speak, <HI>Let it be,</HI> and it <HI>suddenly</HI> started out of Nothing into Being. <HI>Crea|tion is an instantaneous action</HI>: he that did so <HI>suddenly</HI> and so <HI>easily</HI> make it, can as suddenly and as easily make it quake and tremble. How suddenly did God make the Earth to quake where <HI>London stood,</HI> and after his shaking of it, through his great mercy yet <HI>doth stand!</HI></P>
<P>When men thought of no such thing, not the <HI>Stu|dent</HI> in his Study, nor the <HI>Trader</HI> in his Shop, nor the <HI>Workman</HI> at his Work, nor the <HI>Drunkard</HI> at his Cups, when none of these had any apprehension of it. <HI>Suddenly,</HI> The <HI>Student</HI> thought his Desk, on which he was writing, to be removing from him, and when he drew it towards him, it went back again, several times: the <HI>Trader</HI> suddenly seeth a motion in his Wares, and the <HI>Workman</HI> the moving of his Tools without hands, and the <HI>Drunkard</HI> thought indeed the Earth did stagger more than he: many suddenly felt their Chairs to move under them, and could not pre|sently discern the reason, but thought some living Creature had been under their Seats, and did disturb them. Suddenly, many, most that I have spoken with, discerned a dizziness in their Heads, and in the
<PB N="12" REF="000634_0020_0FA96309D12D7600">
instant thought the motion was there, not imagining any thing of the <HI>shaking</HI> of the Earth: <HI>Suddenly</HI> they feared the falling of their Houses; but at first particu|lar persons thought there was some defect and fault in their own particular dwellings, till they did per|ceive the motion was general, and heard others say of their Houses as they found in their own: and all this was <HI>suddenly</HI> done. In a minute, in a moment God can cause an unexpected <HI>Earthquake.</HI> Men must have time to do the <HI>smallest,</HI> but God needs none to do the <HI>greatest</HI> work.</P>
<P>Doct. III. <HI>Tho' an Earthquake suddenly come, and quickly go, and nothing is destroyed thereby, yet it is and might be truly called a great Earthquake.</HI> It is expres|ly said in this Text this Earthquake <HI>suddenly</HI> came, we do not read it lasted long nor that the Prison-house, or Persons in it, were destroyed or hurt there|by, yet we read it was a <HI>great Earthquake.</HI> When many Houses are swallowed up, and many Men, Women and Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dren (as this present year in <HI>Ja|maica</HI>) are destroyed, and go down alive into the Bowels of the Earth by opening of its mouth to eat them up as one morsel, then men will call it a great Earthquake.</P>
<P>But such a one as was so lately in <HI>London, &amp;c.</HI> when not one House was destroyed, nor one Person consumed, seems to be so small (especially now it is over and all safe) as is not worth their observation, for People now are as little concerned already, as if it had not been, or they had quite forgotten that it was. But let such slighters of this late work of God, and regardless of this Judgment, and calling of it a little thing, tell me</P>
<P N="1">1. Was not <HI>this a great Earthquake</HI> that made so many Houses as be in such a great City as this to
<PB N="13" REF="000634_0021_0FA9630A8A3F4698">
move, and shake, and tremble, tho' they stood? Is it not a great thing to make one of <HI>London</HI> streets, and the Houses therein so to quake? much more two or ten, much more all and every one?</P>
<P N="2">2. Was it not a <HI>great Earthquake</HI> that <HI>did reach so far,</HI> and extended it self so many miles at the same instant of the same day to so many places in <HI>England</HI> as we have heard.</P>
<P N="3">3. Yet more, was it not a <HI>great Earthquake</HI> when it did enlarge it self, and reached <HI>at the same time</HI> to so <HI>many Cities and Towns beyond the Sea</HI>? Did God stretch out his Arm so far, and do you look upon i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as a little thing, not worthy your observation, re|membring, or spiritual improvement of it.</P>
<P N="4">4. If it were so small in your Eyes, <HI>what made so many to be in so great a consternation</HI>? why did so many run out of their Houses, and such as were sit|ting at their Tables hasten from their Dinners with their Napkins in their hands, to get into the Streets? why did so many run from their Shops? what was the reason, of the sudden, common cry, by so many, one by one, <HI>My House is falling,</HI> and <HI>my House is fal|ling,</HI> and my <HI>Children above will he destroyed</HI> and <HI>yet I dare not go up to fetch them down.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. How little do you know, if this <HI>late Earthquake had been a little more, and had lasted a little longer, a few minutes more, how near you &amp; your Houses would have been to a subversion and total overthrow</HI>? or how near the trembling Earth might have been to opening, and swallowed up both you and your Habitations? For all that you know <HI>by this Earthquake</HI> you were upon the brink of ruine, a little more might have brought you down; and yet will you slight this work of God, as if it were a small, a very little thing?</P>
<P N="6">6. As small a thing as you look upon it to be,
<PB N="14" REF="000634_0022_0FA9630B4883E2C8">
<HI>could any man, or men, could all the mighty men upon the Earth have caused such a shaking and trembling of the Earth, and all upon it.</HI> Could all the mighty <HI>Captains, Lord Generals, Kings</HI> and <HI>Emperours,</HI> with all their Armies, have had such an Influence upon the Earth? if they can batter down strong Walls, and Cities, and Castles with their Instruments of War, yet can any of them, or all of them, cause such a shaking of the Earth as that so lately was? do you ascribe great things to Men, and call them so, that are far inferiour to this, and yet let this pass by with so little observation, as if it were a work so small?</P>
<P N="7">7. If men <HI>could shake</HI> the Earth and your Houses as God did, could they so securely have <HI>preserved</HI> them from falling, and you from hurt, as God did? Was the shaking of your Houses, so much, and the preserving of them so shaken, so great a mercy, in it self, and yet so little in your eyes? and last no lon|ger with a due impression in your memories?</P>
<P N="8">8. While you look upon <HI>this Earthquake</HI> to be so small a thing, can you look upon <HI>your preservation to be so great a mercy as indeed it is?</HI> whilst you lessen the <HI>work</HI> of God, the more you lessen the mercy of God? did God shake you and your Houses, and not overturn you and them, and was not this great mer|cy? Oh! take heed you do not diminish this work of God's power in your own apprehensions, and consequently your <HI>danger then,</HI> and God's mercy now in your safety. Lord! Let <HI>London</HI> so tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mble at thy Judgment with which thou hast so lately visi|ted it, and account it great, that their Repentance, Reformation may be great. And tho' it suddenly came, and quickly ceased, and did no hurt, let not <HI>London account</HI> that work a small work, but thy mer|cy great mercy, vouchsafed in so great a Judgment,
<PB N="15" REF="000634_0023_0FA9630CFAB7AD60">
least in thy wrath yet greater, thou cause the founda|tions of it to shake and tremble more, and do that execution that should make all confess and say (that deny this) that suddenly there was a great Earth|quake.</P>
<P>Doct. IV. <HI>Tho' some Earthquakes have their natural causes, yet some do arise from the immediate hand and power of God without such causes. Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> were imprisoned; in Prison they prayed, and sang Praises, in testimony that God heard their Prayers, he immediately causeth <HI>this Earthquake</HI> under the Prison. Judicious Expositors assert this Earthquake to be miraculous.</P>
<P>In treating on this I shall take this course:</P>
<P N="1">I. Distinguish between <HI>Earthquakes figurative</HI> and <HI>metaphorical,</HI> and such as are <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>real</HI>: because both are spoken of in Scripture, this will be requisite to remove the ambiguity of the word, that one might not be taken for the other.</P>
<P N="2">II. Distinguish <HI>real Earthquakes</HI> into <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>supernatural.</HI> In respect of the Earth it self, whose nature is to rest and stand still, such shakings and mo|tions may be termed <HI>contra natural,</HI> but in respect of the second Causes in Nature, which sometimes pro|duce such tremblings and quakings in the Earth are called <HI>natural,</HI> in contradistinction from those which are caused <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> God's immediate hand, without such causes, and are therefore <HI>supernatural.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. I shall give a short account what <HI>natural Phi|losophers</HI> assert to be the <HI>Causes</HI> of such <HI>Earthquakes.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. Point at the <HI>several sorts</HI> or <HI>kinds</HI> of such <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> and give the names which <HI>Philosophers</HI> and <HI>Divines</HI> from them, do call them by.</P>
<P N="5">V. Enumerate several <HI>antecedent Signs</HI> of Natural Earthquakes, as by observation Men have taken no|tice

<P N="6">VI. Set down some <HI>Effects</HI> and <HI>Consequents</HI> of Earthquakes, whether produced by such Natural Causes, or by the immediate Hand and Power of God.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Lay down some <HI>Conclusions</HI> by way of further Explication of this mighty work of the great God, in causing the Earth thus to shake; or shew its <HI>Ad|juncts.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. Shew what <HI>use</HI> we should make of such tre|mendous works of God, whereby many might have been buried under ground; when <HI>this amazing work</HI> of God is already by many buried in Oblivion, and by few improved according to the greatness of the danger Men were in, or the greatness of the mercy in escaping that danger.</P>
<P>Quest. I. <HI>What are metaphorical Earthquakes?</HI></P>
<P>Earthquakes and movings of the Earth are often taken <HI>meataphorically</HI> for <HI>great Commotions, alterations made in States, Kingdoms and Church,</HI> and for sore and heavy Punishments inflicted by God upon wick|ed and disobedient People. <HI>Isaiah</HI> 29.6. <HI>Thou shalt be visited of the Lord of Hosts with Thunder and with Earthquake, and with great Noise, with Storm and Tempest, and the Flame of devouring Fire.</HI> A figura|tive description of God's Anger against <HI>Jerusalem</HI>; as much as to say, Heaven and Earth shall concur to their ruine; yet some Expositors say, this Earth|quake may be understood according to the letter. <HI>Isa.</HI> 24.18. <HI>The foundations of the earth do shake.

By these and such like Texts of Scripture it appears there are <HI>me|taphorical</HI> Earthquakes to be distinguished from <HI>litte|ral.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. II. <HI>Which are Earthquakes supernatural?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Real and proper Earthquakes are either such as are caused by God's immediate Hand and Power, or such as have their Causes in Nature</HI>; tho' <HI>these</HI> also are ap|pointed, and ordered and ruled by the powerful Pro|vidence of God, and do not come (as some call it) by <HI>chance.</HI> Tho' the finger of God be in those Na|tural Causes, yet such as have been without them must be wholly and only from God. And I shall gather these out of the Scripture, that we might learn to fear and tremble before this great God that needs no winds and vapours, nor any kind of Creature to make the Earth to shake and tremble. And they are these.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The shaking of the earth at God's giving of the Law to</HI> Moses, <HI>and the Children of</HI> Israel. <HI>Exod.</HI> 19.
<PB N="19" REF="000634_0027_0FA963114DBC3470">
18. <HI>And Mount</HI> Sinai <HI>was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended on it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole Mount quaked greatly.</HI> That this quaking of the Mount was <HI>literal,</HI> and not <HI>figurative, Rivet</HI> argues, because it is joyned with the smoke, and Thunders &amp; Light|nings properly to be understood, and saith, That the causes of the moving of the Earth, and of the Mountain as it were leaping at the presence of God, are not to be searched for in Nature, nor should we dispute concerning <HI>Phisical</HI> Reasons of this Commoti|on, for when all things done here are miraculous, the glory of God is obscured, if where he acts <HI>imme|diately</HI> and in an extraordinary manner, and that al|together Divine, we enquire after second Causes, which in such events are none. <HI>Psa.</HI> 68.7. <HI>O God! when thou wentest forth before thy people; when thou didst march through the wilderness Selah.</HI> Verse 8. <HI>The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God; even</HI> Sinai <HI>it self was moved at the presence of God, the God of</HI> Israel.</P>
<P N="2">2. Such a <HI>Supernatural</HI> Commotion of the Earth is also recorded Psal. 114. <HI>per tot. When</HI> Israel <HI>went out of</HI> Egypt, <HI>&amp;c. The Sea saw it and fled</HI>; Jordan <HI>was driven back. The Mountains skipped like Rams, and the little Hills like Lambs.</HI> The <HI>Sea</HI> was divided. <HI>Jordan</HI> driven back, the Mountains and Hills mov'd. All litterally understood. This asserted. Then the <HI>Question</HI> is propounded, <HI>What ailed thee, O thou Sea, that thou fle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">est</HI>; what ailed thee, <HI>O</HI> Jordan, <HI>that thou wast driven back</HI>? What ailed them? did not God by his mighty power, without natural causes that could not have such influx upon the Sea and <HI>Jordan</HI> to divide them, produce those Miracles in the Sea and <HI>Jordan?</HI> When again it is asked, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by

<P><HI>Quest.</HI> V. <HI>What are the Effects and Consequents of Earthquakes, which make them exceeding dreadful where they come?</HI></P>
<P>Reason may dictate to us what terrible Effects, what dismal work Earthquakes, when they have a full Commission from God to execute his VVrath, do make. Our Ears have heard the Miseries of multitudes of Persons, the overthrow and ruine of Towns, and Cities, and Countries: But those that have seen them would speak of them more sensibly, and set them forth more fully. It might make our flesh to tremble to hear of the woful devastation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that the trembling, shaking, and opening of the Earth hath caused in many Ages, in many places; but such as did see, and feel, and suffer by them, have contended with the Earth, whether it or they should tremble most. Oh the Cries and Shrick|ings! Oh, the doleful Lamentations! Oh, what bitter Complaints have been poured out, and wishes in vain have been uttered in the time and places of devouring and desolating Earthquakes; VVhen we shall hear some of those effects (tho' not written of according to the fulness of the Terror wherewith they are done) let us sympa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hize with the poor miserable People (yet left) in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and pray that their Judgment might not come over to <HI>London,</HI> nor Travel further to other places.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Earthquakes cause great Consternation in the
<PB N="34" REF="000634_0042_0FA963218BD9DFE0">
minds of men, and fill their hearts with fear.</HI> When God makes the Earth to shake under them, he makes their hearts to tremble within them. When the Earth shakes and moves they cannot stand upon it without fear. One Earthquake <HI>causeth</HI> many <HI>thou|sand</HI> Heart-quakes Did not many thousand People in <HI>London</HI> in its late Earthquake (tho' through God's great Mercy so short) feel great tremblings within themselves when they felt the Earth to shake under them, and saw their Houses move this way and that way over them, and could not tell whether they would stand or fall; nay, when so many thought &amp; said, their Houses would not stand but fall? Were you not then under great Consternation, when you thought those Houses you had slept in, you must not only so quickly die in, but be buried in them too: That the Houses you had built or rented to shelter you from Storms and Tempests, should bring that Destruction upon you, which many Storms and Tempests had not done? Have not you of late years heard terrible and roaring Thunderings, God Thun|dering with a Voice which none can imitate? Have you not seen great Flashings of Fire and Lightnings, which made the Night like Day, that you said you could see to take up a small thing from off the ground, and were not you then glad you had an House over your head? But when this late Earthquake was, were not you afraid because you had an House over your head, when you thought it would fall upon your head and whole Body? And when this Earthquake was, did you not make as much haste to get out of it, as in Storms and Tempests you ever did to get into it? Is this already forgotten? What! so soon! It is hard to express the fears that many then were filled with, and it is sad to see how little God is feared

since by many that then did fear so much. Beside your own late Experience, Sacred Scripture, as well as Historical Writers, do Record the fears of Men in times of Earthquakes, 1 Sam. 14 15 <HI>There was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison and the spoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it waes a very great tremb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing.</HI> Behold! a quaking Earth, and therefore a trembling People. Behold! Valiant Men of War, that are not afraid of Swords and Bullets, but with undaunt|ed Courage assault their Enemies, and when many lie dead on both sides, fight on with boldness, that fear not so much the shaking of Spears and Pikes, as the shaking of the Earth; the Host trembled, the Garrison trembled, and the Spoilers themselves did also tremble. Spoilers tremble! What! those that had spoiled so many upon the Earth, they tremble lest they should be spoiled by the quaking Earth. The Host, the People, the Garrison, the Spoilers, and Earth did tremble, surely it was a very great trem|bling, Mat. 27.54. <HI>When the Centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the Earth|quake, they feared greatly</HI> Captains, Men of great Spirits, at the quaking of the Earth are filled with great fear. Mat. 28.2. <HI>Behold, there was a great Earthquake.</HI> 4 <HI>For fear of him</HI> (the Angel whose Ministry God used to cause that Earthquake) <HI>the Keepers did shake, and became as dead men</HI>: An Earth|quake is so terrible, causing such frights and fears, that makes Men (as the saying is) look like Death. Acts 16.26. <HI>And suddenly there was a great Earth|quake.</HI> 29. <HI>He</HI> (the Jaylor) <HI>called for a light, and sprung in, and came trembling.</HI> The Gaol trembled, and the Jaylour tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbled. When the Keeper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aw he could not keep the Prison-doors shut, but when
<PB N="36" REF="000634_0044_0FA963228F973218">
he had shut, and lockt, and made them fast, the quaking of the Earth did open, he could not keep himself from trembling. An Earthquake will make even a Jaylour to tremble.</P>
<P>But why such fear and trembling in Men, when such shaking and trembling in the Earth?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In some,</HI> it may arise <HI>from the apprehensions of the terrible Wrath of an Angry God.</HI> There have bin some Earthquakes, that were Tokens of God's Grace and Favour; as the Earthquake shaking the Foun|dations of the Prison, in favour to <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> testifying that God had heard their Prayers made in Prison, and that by it he would deliver them, as he did. And that in <HI>Acts</HI> 4 31. the Apostles prayed, and at their Prayers the place was shaken; the sha|king of the place made them stand the faster in their Faith in God, and trusting to him. But usually Earthquakes are indications of God's Wrath and sore Displeasure. When Men run on in sin against God, to shew his Indignation against it and them, he sometimes will not suffer the Earth to stand still quiet under them. Psal. 18.7. <HI>The Earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the Hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</HI> When Men ap|prehend that God is provoked, and they may appre|hend it, when God in such a terrible manner doth shew it, knowing they are no more a Match for God, than a Worm is to an Angel, or a Child to a Giant; it may put them into such amazing Frights and Fears, saying, God is angry, what shall we do? The Omnipresent God, is angry, whither shall we go? The Just and Holy God is angry, with what can we appease him? He doth shew his Anger, &amp; we do see it, and how shall we escape? God is wroth, and the Earth trembles before him: God is
<PB N="37" REF="000634_0045_0FA963234BF635C8">
wroth, and is come down in sore displeasure, and the Earth quaketh at his presence; our Heads are giddy, but not with Wine; we reel but not with strong Drink. <HI>O stay your selves, and wonder; cry ye out, &amp; cry, they are drunken, but not with wine, they stagger, but not with strong drink, Isa.</HI> 29 9.</P>
<P N="2">2 Conciousness of their own Guilt: <HI>When the Earth did quake, it did not only wake the Jaylour out of his Natural Sleep, but also out of his Spiritual Slum|ber; Conscience was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arm'd, as he was affrighted; his Eyes were opened to see a Terrible God above him. Con|science was Awakened to see his Sins within him, &amp; that had been committed by him, an Angry God above, an Accusing Conscience within, and the Quaking Earth under him, filled him with Fear, and Trembling. When Men do Prosper upon Earth, they can Swill, and Swear, and Sin in all their ways, and Conscience holds its peace, is quiet and still, doth not Reprove, Accuse, Judge, or Condemn them; but when Judgments come, an Hardned</HI> Pharaoh <HI>wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cry out,</HI> I have sinned; <HI>a Wicked</HI> Saul <HI>will confess and say,</HI> I have sinned: <HI>And when an Earthquake comes, is not he an Hardned Seared Wretch, whose Conscience (though bad yet) is quiet within him, when the Earth is not quiet under him? And whose Conscience is not moved, and troubled for his Sin, when the Earth is moved, as being restless under the Burden of such Sinners? But if Conscience then d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th stir, when the Earth doth tremble, the sinner trembles (for the time) considering God's Anger, remembring his sin that did provoke him to it.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 If neither apprehensions of Gods wrath against them, nor sense of sin committed against him, doth fill them with fears at the quaking of the Earth, yet <HI>Ap|prehension of Death at that time might make them trem|ble.</HI> Death is the <HI>King of Terrors,</HI> Job 18.14. Shall
<PB N="38" REF="000634_0046_0FA96324503A7EC8">
not that which is the most Terrible, when it is ap|proaching in so Terrible a manner, make the stoutest heart to quake? If they have no thoughts of Hell and Damnation, yet Death by the trembling of the Earth presents it self unto their thoughts: and though they would not think of it yet they must; though they would divert their minds from it, yet they cannot send these thoughts away till another season: though many go to Hell without fear of Hell, and seldom think of it till they feel it, yet when Death seems to be coming to them by an Earthquake, it almost kills them with the terrour of it, being ready to die with fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of such a Death</P>
<P>There are these Circumstances in this Case that fill men with these amazing fears upon the account of Death.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The sudden surprizal.</HI> An Earthquake comes suddenly in a minute; many times without notice and warning, as this in <HI>London</HI> lately did; and it seems to bring Death with it, and often doth; now an Evil that suddenly comes, doth the more amaze, when in a minutes time, there is not space for men to recollect their thoughts, and fortifie themselves with actings of Reason, or Grace (which Alas are not so ready) against advancing Death. In sickness men have time to prepare and make ready for it, and to allay the fears thereof; but in a moment to be in danger of Death, the fears are more raging and Pre|dominant, and less help against them. Fear without a Remedy must be great Fear.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>The suddeness of Death,</HI> the apprehended nearness of it. The danger did not only seize them suddenly. What! die so soon! what, within a minute or two? will Death stay no longer? can it not a minute more be delayed? what! so soon step into Eternity? so
<PB N="39" REF="000634_0047_0FA9632808DCD838">
suddenly, must I hasten into another everlasting World? I never did so suddenly remove from one House to another, and must <HI>I</HI> now so suddenly re|move from one World to another? from a tempo|ral into an eternal World? and yet not to leave this, nor to go into that? It is hard to imagine the power and strength of fear that must invade and fill them in such distress&punc;</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The unavoidableness of Death</HI> apprehended in an over throwing Earthquake augments their fears, or torments them with despair of Life. If a man be sick, the means he useth keeps up his hope of Life, and the more he hopes he shall live, the less are his fears of Death. But in a desolating Earthquake, what hopes can Men have? whither can they in a moment go to escape the ruine? what present Friend can help them, when they and their Friends are in the same equal danger? when one must not die without the other? If they stay within doors they apprehend they may be killed with the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l of their Houses: if they run out, they know not but they may be destroyed with the downfal of their Neighbours. Will they hasten into the Fields? what! in a minute? alas! they have not time allowed for such an escape, or if they had, there the Earth in an Earthquake might swallow them up. No where safe, every where in great fear.</P>
<P N="4">4 Apprehensions of sudden, unavoidable Death, and this when <HI>they are in health and strong,</HI> aggra|vates their case, and augments their fears. What! am I well, and yet must die? strong in health, and yet now must die? hath Death forgot its old way of sending Harbingers before it, before it came it self? did it use to send its Serjeants to arrest, before it cast Men into the Prison of the Grave, and must I be
<PB N="40" REF="000634_0048_0FA9632A5CA31DA0">
haled away without Summons? Some have been weaned from the love of Life, and made weary of it by long and languishing Sickness, by wracking &amp; tormenting Pains, and must I in my Youth, or in middle Age, under no pain, with my strength firm, yield to Death? All this doth fill with greater fear.</P>
<P N="5">5 <HI>This unusual way of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing</HI> makes it the more terrible. Others, in other cases, first die, and then are buried, first expire, and then are carried to their Graves; but in an Earthquake must I be buried a|live? first buried and then die? others are carried from their house, when dead, unto the grave, and must mine own house be my grave, and that while I do live? Behold! the Earth quakes under me, my House trembles over me. Oh! what if my trem|bling House should fall, and I in it? what if the Earth should sink under me? what if this quaking Earth should open its mouth, and eat me up alive? what if it should cleave asunder (as in its shaking it hath sometimes done? and swallow me up as it hath done thousands of others? when others die another way, doth this loving Mother lay their dead Bodies in her Bosom, must I die this way, and go down a|live into her bowels? did I live in my Mothers womb before I was born, and must I live (awhile) in this common Mothers bowels, after I am therein buried? This being not the common death of all Men, makes it more terrible to those that appre|hend in an Earthquake they must not die as others do. All laid together, shews that Earthquakes cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e great consternation of mind, perplexing, fretting fears, which is the first effect thereof.</P>
<P>Secondly, Another effect of Earthquakes is <HI>speedy and precipitant flying,</HI> if possibly Men might hasten
<PB N="41" REF="000634_0049_0FA9632BAA176400">
the danger thereof. Tho' they leave their Goods be|bind them in their Houses, they will attempt to fly to save themselves. Numb. 16.32. <HI>The earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to</HI> Korah, <HI>and all their Goods.</HI> Verse 34. <HI>And all</HI> Israel <HI>that were round a|bout them fled at the cry of them: for they said, lest the Earth swallow us up also.</HI> Zach. 14.5. <HI>And ye shall flee to the valley of the Mountains&mdash;yea, ye shall flee like as ye fled from before the Earthquake in the days of</HI> Uzziah <HI>King of</HI> Judah. These were particular Earthquakes, and some by flight escaped from them; but when it shall be more general, or fall out in the place where you dwell, and some miles about you, when it comes in a minute, whither will you fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e? or to what place will you hasten, or in so little time how will you get thither? however, Men shall en|deavour to fle, tho' it should be in vain, when the Earth so moves, they cannot, they will not stand still to be devoured and swallowed up, if by flight they might escape, which they will try, tho' they be overtaken with it. Overtaken! alas! in such a Judgment, you may sooner run into it, <HI>than</HI> run from <HI>it</HI>; you may <HI>think to</HI> leave <HI>the</HI> danger behind you, and still <HI>it</HI> is before you; you running away from <HI>it,</HI> may run to meet it. <HI>But the danger is so dreadful, the Death so formidable, the Misery so great by Earthquakes, that Men will flee from them if they can, that they might not perish in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem.</HI> But better <HI>repent,</HI> reform, and <HI>turn</HI> from sin to God to <HI>prevent them, than to continue in the</HI> sin <HI>that</HI> do procure <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem</HI>; for when they come, you will find <HI>it</HI> hard <HI>to</HI> flee from them.</P>
<P>Thirdly; <HI>Another</HI> Effect is <HI>the cleaving asunder of
<PB N="42" REF="000634_0050_0FA9632C4D150B78">
the Earth, and devouring and swallowing up many Per|sons in a short time.</HI> In other Judgments People die one after another, in this by multitudes. When Death by sickness puts a period to Life, each one hath his own Grave; in this opening the Earth by Earthquakes, one great Grave is made for many, <HI>Numb.</HI> 16 31. <HI>I</HI> 2, 33.</P>
<P>Fourthly; Another Effect is the <HI>subversion of Hou|ses, Towns, and Cities,</HI> with the destruction of their Inhabitants together. History abounds with many sad and grievous Examples hereof. When <HI>Trojan</HI> was at <HI>Antioch,</HI> there happened a most terrible Earth|quake that destroyed many Cities and People, which extended it self very far. Great and terrible Light|nings were before it, then great and unusual storms of Winds, then arising a great and sudden Noise, the Sea wrought, the Waves swelled, the Earth was shaken, Buildings trembled, some did burst asunder, and others first lifted up, fell down. A great and horrible Noise was heard, Walls by contrary moti|ons driven sometimes this way, sometimes that were broken and fell, the Sea with boisterous storms did mount and toss to and fro; the Earth where no Buildings were, was greatly moved: such a thick dust was raised, and so great a darkness upon all, that they could not see one another, nor speak, nor hear one the other, and by reason of the violence of the Wind, and greatness of the dust, could scarcely breathe Trees pluckt up by the roots were cast down upon the ground, many, very many were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with the overthrow of Houses and Walls, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny falling upon one another died, if any hurt by wood or stone, went away thus torn and wounded Bodies, they were more miserable than the rest, for|asmuch as they could not live long, nor yet quickly
<PB N="43" REF="000634_0051_0FA9632D09FE7CA8">
die: of multitudes of Men scarce any escaped with|out some hurt. One might be seen to flee with his Shoulder broke, another with his Arms lost; many laid dead with their Heads separated from their Bo|dies&punc; some with their bruised Breasts vomited Blood. Still the Earth continued to shake both by Night &amp; Day: in this great Calamity they could find no re|medy, nor way of escape: those that were hurt with the fall of Houses died in m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny places, and tho' by the benefit of Vaults and roofed Places some were preserved, yet, the Earthquake continuing, they pe|rished by hunger and famine, before any succour could be brought to them. When the Earthquake ceased, some went-upon the Ruins, where they heard a Womans voice, and the crying of an Infan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; the Ruins had covered both the Mother and the Child; it was wonderful how the Mother should have Milk to nourish her Child; but Mother and Child were taken safe out But whilst the dead Bodies &amp; fallen Houses were more diligently searched, another In|fant was found sucking the Breast of its dead Mo|ther: But Life was a grief to all that had escaped Death, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey beheld the lamentable fall of the City, and so many People destroyed.</P>
<P>Fifthly; <HI>The change of the Channel of the Sea.</HI> In the time of <HI>Valens</HI> the Emperour there happened a|nother tertible Earthquake, whereby an hundred Cities were destroyed in <HI>Crete</HI>: then also the Sea leaving its place, so overflowed certain grounds, which before were plowed, became navigable; and in other places where Men sailed, the Sailers in their Navigation were found upon dry Land where before the Sea was.</P>
<P>Sixthly; Another Effect of Earthquakes hath the Convulsion of Mountains, their sinking down,
<PB N="44" REF="000634_0052_0FA9632DD2BBCAA8">
their clashing and transportatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or removal to a great distance from the places where before they stood. Instances of these History do afford many, but I will only mention one, because more re|markable, how God doth miraculously sometimes preserve praying People, and may move Persons, whose Hous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s after shaking by an Earthquake stand, to pray therein. In the Year 1584. one Mountain by an Earthquake violently removed, destroyed a Town consisting of ninety Families, &amp; threw down all excepting half of one House, where the Master of the Family, with his Wife and Children, kneeling upon their Knees, were praying and calling upon God.</P>
<P>Seventhly; <HI>Infectious Diseases, Plague and Pestilence</HI> are sometimes the Effects of Earthquakes: For the matter of Earthquakes is Pestilential, because subter|raneous, or under Ground, wanting wind and moti|on to purifie it; this therefore when it doth exhale &amp; breath out, or break forth doth infect the Air, and Men by taking in that infected Air, are infected by it In Scripture Earthquakes and Pestilence are set down together, as sore and heavy Judgments; God grant that <HI>London, England,</HI> and all p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aces that have been shaken by this late Earthquake&punc; might so fear and tremble before this Great, Almighty God, as to Re|pent and turn from sin to God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this his Call so lately, powerfully, and mercifully given, that after the Earthquake the Plague and Pestilence might not fol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow.</P>
<P>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">est: VI. <HI>What are the Adjuncts of Earthquakes, which may further inform us concerning this Mighty Work of God?</HI></P>
<P>What I shall add concerning this, may be laid down in those following Conclusions.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="000634_0053_0FA9632EB33E7050">First Concl Sometimes there may be an Earth|quake in some particular place, and not in others near unto it. <HI>The Earthquake which shaked the Foun|dations of the Prison where</HI> Paul <HI>and</HI> Silas <HI>lay, did not extend it self to other places. God that can cause the Rain to fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l upon one City, and not upon another, can make one City <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> when he doth not another.</HI></P>

If they be more cold, they are also more slow. If they be in greater quantity, the Earthquake may be of a longer continuance, for much is not so soon evaporated, as a little. The Nature of the place also wherein an Earthquake is, may cause the longer or shorter duration of it; for if the surface of the Earth, in whose Caverns the matter of the Earth|quake is contained and shut up, be more solid, close and lesser holes, chinks and pores be in it, the Earth|quake lasts the longer, by reason of the more slow and difficult evaporation of the matter that causeth it.</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>Concl.

<P N="4">4 <HI>Concl</HI> Sometimes an Earthquake <HI>may be once in some parts of the Earth, and not return again, sometimes it may repeat its c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urse, and often put the same places in|to many trembling fits.</HI> When the shaking is over once, the bitterness of God's Wrath, and our Ruine might not be past; if the shaking of London should be rei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ated, the latter might be more grievous than the former. All these second Causes are ordered and over-ruled by the Providence of God: All the Na|tural Causes of Earthquakes are subject to God's pow|er, and are at his Beck, command and call; there|fore tho' <HI>London</HI> be safe afer its late shaking, yet let it not be secure, for the same Hand and Power of God that did shake it once, can again, and throw it down.</P>
<P><HI>Vse</HI> I. Earthquakes, when armed with the wrath of God, and come with his Commission to destroy, are one <HI>of the sorest Judgments</HI> whereby he Executeth his Vengeance, and manifesteth his hot Indignation against sin and sinners upon Earth.

They have a voice, &amp; we should have an hearing ear; let's not be deaf to the Instructions that God is giving of us; nor dull to take out the Lessons he is teaching us.

<P N="1">1. The Earthquake there was at the Death of Christ. The <HI>Jews</HI> hearts were stony and hard, and did not fear nor tremble to shed the innocent and most precious Blood of the Son of God, but when it fell upon the ground, the Earth did shake and tremble to receive it. <HI>Abel's</HI> Blood did cry to Heaven from the ground, and <HI>Cain</HI> was cursed and the Earth was cursed to him for that bloody fact. <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.10. <HI>And he said what hast thou done? the voice of thy brothers blood crieth unto me from the ground.</HI> Verse 11. <HI>And now art thou cursed from the Earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy bro|thers blood at thine hand.</HI> Verse 12. <HI>When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her

A Fugitive and a Vagabond shalt thou be in the Earth.</HI> Was not the Blood of Christ of greater worth and value than <HI>Abel's,</HI> or of all Men, being the Blood of him that was God as well as Man, pure and spot|less; was not therefore the shedding of it by Men, a more heinous sin and barbarous fact; and yet the shedders of it stupid, and not afraid to take away his li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e? what doth the Earth under their feet, but shake and tremble at what they did not? and what improvement did some then present make thereof? and what conclusions did they draw from it? Mat. 27 51. <HI>Behold, the Vail of the Temple was rent in twain, from the top to the bottom, and the Earth did quake, and the Rocks rent.</HI> Verse 54 <HI>And when the Centurion, and they that were with him, watching Je|sus, saw the Earthquake and those things that were done, they feared greatly.</HI> And what did they say? what did they gather and infer from thence? what Con|clusion laid they down as sure and certain? they said, <HI>Truly this was the Son of God.</HI> Though you did not see it, as they did, yet you read it recorded by them that did see it, and do not you believe this matter of fact, and the record of it to be true? and will not you say, surely that Christ, at whose Death the very Earth did quake, and other great Miracles done, was the Son of God, and love him, desire him, trust him, receive him, and consent to have him for your Lord and Saviour accordingly? was the sha|king of the Earth, and the rending of the Rocks, a testimony against the Impenitent, Unbelieving, and Rocky-hearted <HI>Jews,</HI> that neither before, for all the Miracles done by him in his Life, nor after they saw what was done at his Death, did own him for the Son of God, nor receive him for their Saviour and Lord, but did still reject him, and do you hear of the

The Earth at h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Death did quake; do you fear and tremble, lest you be found a Reje|cter of him.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Earthquake</HI> at the <HI>Resurrection of Jesus Christ,</HI> ought to be improved by us to <HI>establish us in the Articles of our Faith of Christ's Resurrection, and our own,</HI> and to rejoyce at the thoughts of both. And the more the Earth did tremble, the more sted|fast let our Faith be. Mat. 28.2. <HI>And behold there was a great Earthquake.</HI> Verse 5. <HI>Ye seek Jesus.</HI> Ver. 6. <HI>He is not here, for he is risen.</HI> Verse 8. <HI>They de|parted quickly, with fear and great joy, and did run to bring his Disciples word.</HI> The Earth did quake, and they did believe; the Earth did quake, and they did joy that Christ was risen. As the Earth did quake to drink up his Blood, so it did quake to detain his Body beyond the appointed time, and by its motion did congratulate the Victory Christ had obtained o|ver Death in its own Dominions. Improve this also to believe the power of Christ to raise our Bodies al|so, for if he give the word, if he utter his voice, <HI>Come forth ye dead, Awake, Arise,</HI> he will make the Earth to quake and tremble, to deliver up its dead. Rev. 20.11. <HI>And I saw a great white Throne, and him that sate upon it, from whose Presence the Earth and Heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them.</HI> Verse 12 <HI>And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God, and the Books were opened, and another Book was opened, which is the Book of Life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the Books, ac|cording to their Works.</HI> The Earth did quake when

Christ did die, and when he arose; and so it shall when he shall come to raise the dead, and judge the World.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Earthquake at the Prayers of the Apostles (when the Gospel was opposed, and the Preachers of it Persecuted) that God would grant unto his Servants that with all boldness they may speak his Word, and for confirmation of their Faith, and satis|faction that their Prayers were heard, his Church &amp; Kingdom should be propogated and preserved, the place was shaken where they were, <HI>Act.</HI> 4.24.31. He that can shake the Earth, can establish his Church; he that can make Mountains quake, can and hath built his Church upon such a Rock, that no Power shall prevail against it.</P>

Hath this that you have felt and seen put you on to any greater diligence for your Souls Salvation, than you had before? Careless before, and so still? Impenitent before, and so still?

an earthly Rock, tho' when the Wind blows, and Rain descends and beat against it, yet it stands; but if an Earthquake come, with a commission from God to overturn, or sink it your best foundation cannot secure it.
