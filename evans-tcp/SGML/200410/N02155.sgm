<HEAD>THE Occasion of the Publication.</HEAD>
<P>_AMONG the <HI>Remarkables</HI> in the Life of the Memorable Dr <HI>Increase Ma|ther</HI>; there is this Passage. p. 217.</P>
<P><Q>THE Doctor felt once upon his Mind, a strong Impression, to Preach a Sermon about the Crime of <HI>Self-Murder</HI>; but he resisted, he declined, he laid it aside. He then wrote in his Diary: <HI>This Day my former Thoughts about Preaching on the Evil of</HI> Self-Murder, <HI>returning upon me again; I look'd up to GOD, and as I was lifting up my Heart to him, then walking in my Garden, I was most strang|ly moved and melted. I could not speak a word for some time. Tears gushed from my Eyes. And it seemed as if it were said unto me,</HI> Preach on that Subject, &amp; thou shalt Save Bodies &amp; Souls from Death. The Lion is among thy Flock; Resist him with the Sword of the Spirit, and the Sheep Committed unto thy Charge shall be rescued out of his Bloody Hands! <HI>What the meaning of this is, I know not; but wonder at it. There may be something of Heaven in it, more than I am aware of.</HI> The next Lords-Day, he Preached the Sermon [On, <HI>Act.</HI> XVI.27, 28.] And Behold, soon after it, there came such to him, as informed him, That <HI>at that very Time,</HI> the Temptations to <HI>Self-Murder</HI> were impelling of them with an <HI>Horrible
<PB N="II" REF="002563_0003_0FDB71A439A5D000">
Violence</HI>; But GOD had Blessed that Happy Ser|mon for their Deliverance! They afterwards joined to his Church. &mdash;</Q></P>
<P>A Religious and Honourable Person, upon the Reading of this passage, hoping that the Sermon might be again Blessed [more than <HI>Forty</HI> Years after the first Preaching of it,] made enquiry, whether the <HI>Notes of the Sermon</HI> could be Recover|ed: And here is all that could be Recovered. The Venerable Author, who in the <HI>Sixty Six</HI> Years of his Ministry, did not <HI>use his Notes</HI> in the Public, did not so <HI>write his Notes,</HI> as to have all the Lively, Instructing, Affecting <HI>Amplifications</HI> of the Pulpit in them. The Reader will perceive something of this, in the <HI>Minutes</HI> of the Sermon here Exhibited; and the Transcriber durst not make any Unjustifiable <HI>Interpolations</HI>: But his Inserting sometimes the <HI>Words</HI> of the <HI>Texts</HI> that are quoted, may be al|low'd him.</P>
<P>THE Design of the Worthy Gentleman who de|manded this Publication, is the same <HI>now,</HI> that has been in many others, to which he has generously Contributed; That is, <HI>To Do Good.</HI> And if any one poor Tempted Soul, be rescued from the hands of the <HI>Destroyer,</HI> by what is here offered, I am sure, he will count his Expences richly reimbursed: It may also comfort him, to have such a <HI>Token for Good</HI>; that as Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> has his Friend <HI>United</HI> with him in the <HI>Services</HI> of the Kingdom now; so they will be hereafter <HI>United</HI> in the Glorious <HI>En|joyments</HI> of it.</P>

<HEAD>Do thyself no Harm.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ACTS XVI.27, 28.</HI></BIBL>
<P>HE would have killed himself; &mdash; But <HI>Paul</HI> cried with a loud Voice, saying, <HI>Do thyself no Harm.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IN the Context, the Evangelist gives an Account concerning, the Imprisonment of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> for Preaching the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST; and a most Remarkable Occurrence happening thereupon, which proved the <HI>Conversion</HI> of the <HI>Gaoler,</HI> who had dealt very cruelly with them. We have herewithal a Relation of what proved the occasion of that strange <HI>Conversion.</HI> It was brought to pass, by means of a <HI>Miraculous Earth|quake</HI> which happened at <HI>Midnight.</HI> The <HI>Gaoler</HI> being by this <HI>Earthquake</HI> frightfully waked out of Sleep, was full of Distress and Consternation. While he was thus distress'd in his Mind, the <HI>Devil</HI> took advantage to fall upon him with horrid Temptations.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002563_0005_0FDB71AAAAB18CD8">TWO Things are noted in the Words before us. <HI>First.</HI> There is noted, The <HI>Evil</HI> which the <HI>Gaoler</HI> was Tempted unto; To wit, <HI>Self-Mur|der.</HI> He <HI>drew his Sword,</HI> and was just ready to sheath it in his own Wretched Bowels. <HI>Secondly.</HI> There is noted, That which was the happy means of diverting him from the <HI>Evil</HI>; To wit, The Apostles <HI>speaking</HI> to him. <HI>He cried with a loud Voice</HI>; Very <HI>Earnestly.</HI> And it was Time to be in <HI>Earnest.</HI> It was a <HI>matter of Life and Death!</HI></P>
<P>INDEED, he used the most Effectual Argument that could be, to disswade him from persisting in his Attempt of <HI>Self-Murder.</HI> He convinced him, that the <HI>Temptation</HI> which hurried him on to the Barbarous and bloody Fact by him design|ed was a meer <HI>Needless Fear.</HI> He was afraid, the Prisoners were gone; and therefore the Ma|gistrates who Committed them to Prison would put him to Death, for letting them escape. Therefore <HI>Paul</HI> says, <HI>We are all here.</HI> How the Apostle knew, that this was his <HI>Temptation</HI>; This is not expresly declared. Probably, the <HI>Gaoler</HI> might utter some words to that purpose. How|ever, He was distress'd with a <HI>Causeless Fear</HI>: And yet this Distress did through the <HI>Instigation of Satan</HI> prevail so far, that he was just upon the point of <HI>making himself away.</HI> Such is the Subtilty of <HI>Satan,</HI> and his great power over the Minds of Men; when GOD shall see meet to let him loose; as that he can from meer <HI>Imaginary Fears</HI> put them upon no less an Evil than <HI>Self-Destruction</HI>: It was with the <HI>Gaoler</HI> so; and the <HI>Temptation</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="002563_0006_0FDB71AC80423538">
had prevail'd, if <HI>Paul</HI> had not earnestly caution'd him from heark'ning to it.</P>
<P>DOCTRINE.</P>
<P>PEOPLE distressed with Temptation, had some|times need to be Earnestly Cautioned against the Sin of SELF-MURDER.</P>
<P>THERE are Two Things to be now spoken to; <HI>First.</HI> What the <HI>Distresses</HI> and <HI>Temptations</HI> are, that put Men upon the Sin of <HI>Self-Mur|der:</HI> And then, The <HI>Reasons</HI> why they that are so <HI>Tempted</HI> should be <HI>Earnestly Caution'd</HI> against this Evil.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. THE <HI>Distresses</HI> and <HI>Temptations</HI> that often put Men upon the Sin of <HI>Self-Murder: What are They?</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. SOMETIMES Men are <HI>Tempted</HI> unto this Evil, that so they may not fall into the hands of those, that they think, will put them to a <HI>Misera|ble Death.</HI> This was the <HI>Temptation</HI> of the <HI>Gaoler</HI> now before us. According to the Law among the <HI>Romans,</HI> if the <HI>Gaoler</HI> let his <HI>Prisoner</HI> go, he was to suffer the same Punishment which the <HI>Prisoner</HI> should have undergone. Hence, <HI>Act.</HI> XII.18, 19. When <HI>Peter</HI> escaped, the <HI>Souldiers</HI> that were set for his <HI>keepers, Herod</HI> ordered them, <HI>to be put to Death.</HI> Sinful Creatures think with themselves, that if they Live a while longer, they shall be put to a more <HI>Miserable Death</HI>; and therefore it
<PB N="4" REF="002563_0007_0FDB71AE0CF98880">
may be said of them, <HI>Sin hast thou chose rather than Affliction!</HI> They will Destroy <HI>themselves,</HI> rather than stay for <HI>other Men</HI> to do it. We have several Instances of this in the Sacred Scriptures. <HI>Saul,</HI> Bloody <HI>Saul,</HI> was one of them: He will <HI>Dy</HI> by his own hands rather than the <HI>Philistines. Achitophel</HI> was another of them. He might well conclude, when his Counsel was not hearken'd to, that <HI>David</HI> would prevail, and then he must needs <HI>Dy</HI> for his Treasons. What is it that we read of <HI>Zimri?</HI> 1 King. XVI.18. <HI>When he saw the City was taken,</HI> and he must fall into the hands of his Enemies, he <HI>burnt the Kings House over him, and he died.</HI> Humane History gives us many other Instances. Among the rest, <HI>Hannibal</HI> poisoned himself, that he might not fall into the hands of his Enemies. <HI>Demosthenes</HI> did the like. The Wicked Jews Blasphemously imagined, that the Holy Son of GOD, the Blessed JESUS, would have killed Himself, for fear of falling into <HI>Their</HI> hands: Joh VIII.22. <HI>Then said the Iews, will He kill Himself!</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. THE <HI>Fear of Disgrace</HI> in the World, puts Men upon it. There was This also in the <HI>Tempta|tion</HI> of the <HI>Gaoler:</HI> He thought it a <HI>Disgraceful</HI> Thing to be put to Death in a way of Judicial Proceeding, and with a Public Execution: And therefore! &mdash; Sometimes a <HI>Proud Spirit</HI> had rather Commit the <HI>Greatest Sin</HI> against GOD, than undergo a <HI>little Disgrace</HI> from Men. This was the <HI>Temptation</HI> of <HI>Abimeleck</HI> to <HI>Murder him|self,</HI> or (which is the same) desire another to
<PB N="5" REF="002563_0008_0FDB71B22A60F7F0">
kill him: Judg. IX.54. <HI>Slay me, that men say not of me, A Woman slew him.</HI> There have been some, that when they have Committed foul and shame|ful Sins, have through fear of Punishment and <HI>Disgrace</HI> among Men, <HI>destroy'd themselves.</HI> To a <HI>Proud Spirit</HI> there is nothing so Bitter as <HI>Disgrace</HI> and Infamy. When this <HI>Temptation</HI> overcomes them, they will chuse <HI>Death</HI> rather than such a Misery. And thus also it is, when Men for <HI>fear of Want</HI> shall desperately <HI>Destroy themselves</HI>: They think, it will be a <HI>Disgraceful Thing,</HI> to be beholden unto others for their Subsistence; and, it may be, to be brought <HI>unto a morsel of Bread,</HI> and Live <HI>like a Beggar</HI>! such a <HI>Temptation</HI> is too hard for them; and therefore they think to be eased of it by a <HI>Self-Destruction.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>DISTRESS of Conscience</HI> is that from which the <HI>Devil</HI> does many times, take occasion to <HI>Tempt</HI> Men unto the Sin of <HI>Self-Murder. Saul</HI> was in <HI>Distress of Conscience,</HI> as well as other|wise Distressed; and therein he would have <HI>Starved himself to Death.</HI> See 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> XXVIII.15, 22, 23. &mdash; <HI>Iudas</HI> is in <HI>Distress of Con|science</HI>; And <HI>Then!</HI> &mdash; he flies to the <HI>Halter,</HI> that he may let out his wretched Soul. The Burden of a Guilty and a Wounded <HI>Conscience,</HI> it is Intolerable. It is said, Prov. XVIII.14. <HI>Who can bear it?</HI> Poor Creatures having such a <HI>Wound|ed Spirit,</HI> and being under the <HI>strong Delusions of Satan,</HI> often think to obtain some ease by ruining of themselves. Especially when <HI>Inward</HI> &amp; <HI>Outward</HI> Troubles meet together, (as oftentimes they do)
<PB N="6" REF="002563_0009_0FDB71B363FF4560">
Miserable Creatures are in danger of becoming Guilty of this Crime; <HI>Satan</HI> takes this Advantage to <HI>Tempt</HI> them unto it. It seems, as if <HI>Iob</HI> were thus <HI>Tempted</HI>; though he had the Grace to Resist and Conquer the <HI>Temptation.</HI> He was in <HI>Affliction</HI> upon Temporal Accounts; At the same time he thought, <HI>GOD was his Enemy</HI>; He felt the <HI>Terrors of GOD</HI> in his Soul. GOD suffered <HI>Satan</HI> to ter|rify him with frightful Dreams. He was <HI>Tempted</HI> hereupon to chuse the most <HI>Ignominious Death,</HI> rather than be in such Misery. He says, Job VII 15 <HI>My Soul chuseth Strangling, and Death rather than Life.</HI> But the Mercy of GOD Preserved him from <HI>laying Violent Hands</HI> upon himself! &mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 2. FOR what <HI>Reasons,</HI> are they that are so <HI>Tempted,</HI> earnestly to be cautioned against Com|plying with the <HI>Temptation</HI>?</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>TEMPTATIONS</HI> to <HI>Self-Murder.</HI> SATAN is in them! Such <HI>Temptations</HI> are not from the Holy &amp; Blessed GOD. <HI>Let no man say, when he is</HI> thus <HI>Tempted, I am tempted of GOD! &mdash; Iobs</HI> Wife tempted him, to Commit such a Sin, as would bring a quick Death upon himself. <HI>Curse GOD, and Dy!</HI> She was an Instrument of <HI>Satan:</HI> It was the <HI>Devil</HI> that put her upon giving that <HI>Cursed</HI> and <HI>Bloody</HI> Counsel to her Husband. The <HI>Devil</HI> would perswade Men to think of <HI>getting out of Affliction by Sin</HI>; &mdash; yea, &amp; to <HI>Dy Sinning</HI>;&mdash; that the <HI>last Act</HI> which they do before they go out of the World, should be to Commit some <HI>Great Sin</HI> a|gainst the Glorious GOD. He knows, This will
<PB N="7" REF="002563_0010_0FDB71B4C0F5C5F8">
render them, <HI>unfit to Dy</HI>! &mdash; Thus the <HI>Devil</HI> says, <HI>Murder, &amp; Dy! &mdash; Stab thyself,&mdash; Shoot thyself,&mdash; Choak thyself, &mdash; &amp; Dy!</HI> The <HI>Devil</HI> is therefore said to be &mdash; Joh. VIII.44. <HI>A Murderer.</HI> Yea, <HI>Satan</HI> has a most <HI>peculiar Hand</HI> in the perpetration of this Crime: As is evident from the <HI>strange manner,</HI> how sometimes it is accomplished: &mdash; by <HI>Drowning,</HI> in a <HI>small Puddle</HI> of Water; &mdash; <HI>Hanging,</HI> upon a <HI>small Twig</HI> not enough to bear the weight of a Man; &mdash; or, with <HI>Knees</HI> resting on the Ground. <HI>Satan</HI> must needs have a great hand &mdash; the <HI>Invisible World</HI> is most sen|sibly at work, in such things as these! &mdash;</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Self-Murder</HI> is a very <HI>Great Sin. Murder</HI> is the greatest Sin against the <HI>second Table</HI> of the Law. Tis a great Provocation in the sight of GOD. Hence is that expression in the Scripture, concerning a most Abominable Thing,&mdash; Isa. LXVI.3. <HI>It is as if he killed a Man</HI> Tis a Sin that Cries to Heaven for <HI>Vengeance</HI>! &mdash; See <HI>Act.</HI> XXVIII 4. &mdash; But <HI>Self-Murder</HI> is the worst kind of <HI>Murder.</HI> &mdash; Tis the most <HI>Unnatural</HI>! &mdash; For a Man to <HI>Murder</HI> a near <HI>Relative,</HI> tis worse than for him to <HI>Murder</HI> another. And the <HI>nearer</HI> the <HI>Relation</HI> is, the Greater the Sin, &mdash; Therefore &mdash; Tis a most <HI>Complicated Sin</HI>?</P>
<P>THE <HI>Self-Murderer</HI> Sins against the Glorious GOD, in defacing of His <HI>Image</HI>; and in dishonour|ing of His <HI>Name.</HI> &mdash; especially, if he be a person that has made any pretences to Religion. &mdash;</P>
<P>HE Sins against <HI>Himself</HI> &mdash; against his own <HI>Body,</HI> as if <HI>hating his own Flesh</HI>; &mdash; And it may be said unto him, <HI>Thou hast Sinned against thy own Soul.</HI> His <HI>Reputation</HI> also is forever destroy'd.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002563_0011_0FDB71B8CFDFA110">HE Sins against his <HI>Relatives</HI>; To whom he causes the greatest <HI>Grief,</HI> and the greatest <HI>Dis|honour,</HI> that can be. &mdash;</P>
<P N="3">III. A Wilful &amp; Impaenitent <HI>Self-Murderer, cannot be saved</HI>! We are taught, 1 Joh. III.15. <HI>Ye know, that no Murderer has Eternal Life abiding in him.</HI> Then, most certainly, no <HI>Self-Murderer</HI>&mdash; without <HI>Repentance</HI>; &mdash; which, in many cases, how can it be supposed!</P>
<P>ITS true, The <HI>Elect</HI> of GOD may be grievously <HI>Tempted</HI> unto this Sin. The <HI>Gaoler</HI> was one of those. &mdash; Yea, many of the <HI>Elect</HI> have been so, in the pangs of the <HI>New-Birth,</HI> at their First <HI>Conver|sion</HI> unto GOD. And some have been so, after their <HI>Conversion.</HI> The <HI>Best of Saints</HI> upon earth, may be so. Of <HI>Iob,</HI> I have told you. I may tell you, of <HI>Luther,</HI> &mdash; And of many more &mdash; when the <HI>Devil</HI> has no hope of prevailing, yet he will <HI>Tempt</HI> unto this Crime. He will do it, only to vex and molest the faithful Servants of GOD! &mdash; He there|fore <HI>Tempted</HI> our Blessed JESUS Himself unto it. See <HI>Mat.</HI> IV.6. &mdash;</P>
<P>BUT, <HI>except it be in case of Distraction</HI>; it is a rare thing for Satan thus to prevail over any that belong unto GOD. If he <HI>do,</HI> yet the Execution cannot be so dispatched, as to leave <HI>no space of Re|pentance.</HI> Therefore, it is very observable, that though we read of some of the <HI>Elect</HI> of GOD in the Scripture, that have been <HI>Tempted</HI> unto this Crime, yet none were left actually to Commit it, but such as we have cause to look upon as <HI>Reprobates,</HI> Were a <HI>Saul,</HI> an <HI>Achitophel,</HI> a <HI>Zimri,</HI> &amp; a <HI>Iudas,</HI> any other?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="002563_0012_0FDB71BA063F3670">AS for <HI>Secret Things,</HI> and <HI>Extraordinary Cases,</HI> we must leave them with GOD. Nevertheless, It is a clear <HI>Scriptural Principle,</HI> That an <HI>Impenitent Murderer cannot be Saved.</HI> There are some sins, that an <HI>Elect</HI> Person shall be preserved from: Such particularly is, The <HI>Unpardonable Blasphemy</HI> against the Holy SPIRIT. And such is, <HI>Final Impenitency.</HI> Therefore it concerns them that have the <HI>use of Reason,</HI> and know what they do, to beware of this Sin, as they bear any Respect unto the <HI>Salvation</HI> of their Precious and Immortal Souls.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>LIFE</HI> is a great <HI>Mercy.</HI> Men should be cautioned against <HI>Despising,</HI> and wilfully casting away the <HI>Mercies</HI> of GOD. <HI>Life</HI> in this World, is an Invaluable <HI>Mercy</HI>: Because, <HI>whilst there is Life, there is Hope</HI>: Eccl. IX.4. <HI>To him who is joined un|to all the Living, there is Hope.</HI> As long as Persons are <HI>Alive,</HI> there is an <HI>Hopeful Possibility,</HI> that they may <HI>Repent,</HI> and <HI>Turn,</HI> and <HI>Live</HI> unto GOD: &mdash; That they may obtain an assurance of an <HI>Interest</HI> in JESUS CHRIST; &mdash; That the <HI>Pardon</HI> of their Sins may be secured. But when <HI>Life</HI> is at an end, there is no <HI>Hope</HI> of <HI>Repentance,</HI> or of getting a <HI>Part</HI> in CHRIST, or of getting <HI>Sin</HI> to be forgiven. We are told, Heb. IX.27. <HI>After Death the Iudgment.</HI> If those things be not made sure of, before the Soul of a Man is out of his Body, and his <HI>Probation-time</HI> is over, it will be <HI>too late</HI> for ever. So we read; Isa. XXXVIII.18. &mdash; <HI>They that go down to the pit cannot hope for thy Truth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="002563_0013_0FDB71BBE90F94D8">USE 1. WE may here take notice of the <HI>Folly</HI> &amp; <HI>Unreasonableness</HI> of those <HI>Temptations,</HI> whereby Sinful Creatures are sometimes put upon <HI>Self-De|struction.</HI> &mdash; As particularly, &mdash; That <HI>Fear of Dis|grace</HI> in the World; &mdash; For any man to <HI>do himself Harm</HI> for fear of <HI>That,</HI> is marvellous Folly! A man cannot more <HI>Disgrace himself</HI> than by Committing such a Sin. He leaves an Everlasting <HI>Blot</HI> upon his Name, as long as he shall be spoken of in the world. And there is besides, <HI>an Everlasting Con|tempt,</HI> which such persons Dying Impaenitently, must at the <HI>Last Day</HI> be exposed unto: when, be|sides all their other Sins, there shall be This al|ledged against them, <HI>That they were guilty of the most Unnatural Wickedness in the World.</HI> Is it not <HI>Folly</HI> for men to bring upon themselves an <HI>Eternal Shame</HI> and <HI>Confusion world without end,</HI> that they may escape a <HI>Temporal</HI>!</P>
<P>THUS, when Men shall <HI>do Harm unto them|selves</HI> for the <HI>Fear of Want:</HI> It is unspeakable <HI>Folly</HI> and Madness in the Children of Men to do so: Because they do by <HI>That Act, [without Repen|tance!</HI>] throw themselves into that place, where they shall <HI>want every good Thing</HI>; and, Psal. XLIX.19. <HI>They shall never see Light.</HI> In <HI>Hell</HI> there is the <HI>Want of every Thing.</HI> No <HI>Spiritual Blessings</HI> are there; No <HI>Sabbaths,</HI> nor any means of Grace, are there. No, nor any <HI>Earthly Comforts</HI> neither: Not so much as a <HI>Drop of Water,</HI> to relieve a Tongue in Torments there!</P>
<P>THERE is another poor Creature thus <HI>Tempted</HI> of the <HI>Devil. I am a Reprobate, and I am sure I shall
<PB N="11" REF="002563_0014_0FDB71BD0B0B1660">
not be saved; and therefore, if I destroy my self, I shall have less punishment in Hell, than if I lived longer in the World.</HI> I Answer; Thou canst not know thy <HI>Reprobation.</HI> It is not GOD, but <HI>Satan,</HI> who tells thee, That thou art a <HI>Reprobate.</HI> Thou art not <HI>sure,</HI> that thou shalt not be <HI>Sav'd.</HI> The Lord says no such thing unto thee; but says, Isa. XLV.22. <HI>Look unto me, All the ends of the Earth, and be ye Saved.</HI> Be it how it will with thee, <HI>Do thy self no Harm</HI>: Thou mayst, for ought any one can say, yet be Saved for ever. Nor is this true, that thy <HI>Damnation</HI> will be the less, if thou <HI>Destroy thy self.</HI> For <HI>Damnation</HI> and Punishment in <HI>Hell</HI> will be the greater, and the deeper, according to the <HI>Aggravations of the Sins</HI> which have brought the Sinner thither. Now <HI>Self-Murder</HI> is a Sin so heinous and <HI>Aggra|vated,</HI> that if thou Dy Impaenitently under the guilt of it, thy <HI>Damnation</HI> will doubtless be the greater for it.</P>
<P>IT may be said; <HI>I will Repent, and Pray for the Pardon of my Sin, before I do it.</HI> I Answer; What a <HI>Delusion</HI> of <HI>Satan!</HI> I have read indeed of a Philosopher, who called upon his Gods, and so <HI>threw him self into the Fire</HI> to his own Destructi|on. But canst thou think, That GOD will hear such <HI>Prayers</HI>? No, &mdash; Psal. LXVI.18. <HI>If I regard Iniquity in my Heart, the Lord will not hear me.</HI> If thou comest before GOD, with bloody Resolu|tions in thy Heart, GOD will not accept of thy Prayers. He says, Isa. I.15. <HI>When you make ma|ny Prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of Blood.</HI> Nor can this be called, <HI>Repentance:</HI> For

HENCE it is an EVIL THING to SPEAK FAVOURABLY, either of <HI>Self-Murder,</HI> or of <HI>Self-Murderers.</HI> There have been those who have undertaken to justify <HI>Self-Murder</HI> in some cases. [See <HI>Voet.</HI> vol. 4. <HI>Disp. de laesione sui-ipsius.] Pagan</HI> Philosophers taught, That it was lawful for Persons to <HI>Murder themselves,</HI> that they might save their Reputati|on; or prevent falling into the hands of their Enemies. &mdash; Famous the Story of <HI>Lucretia.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>IN what we call, The <HI>Second</HI> Book of the <HI>Mac|cabees,</HI> we find celebrated an Action of one <HI>Rasis,</HI> for which the <HI>Iews</HI> cry him up as a <HI>Martyr</HI>; but <HI>Austin</HI> censures him for a Criminal <HI>Self-Murderer,</HI> with Reasons that cannot be an|swered.</P>
<P>YEA, some <HI>Christians</HI> have cried up those, who to save their <HI>Chastity,</HI> and so themselves, from <HI>Disgrace,</HI> have destroyed their own Lives. And the crying up of such a <HI>Fact,</HI> has given occasion unto many others, to become guilty of that <HI>Hor|rible Thing</HI>: that <HI>Unnatural Sin.</HI> But, must <HI>Saul</HI>'s <HI>Self-Murder</HI> be lawful too?</P>
<P>TO extol the <HI>Persons</HI> of <HI>Self-Murderers</HI> to Heaven, is an Evil and a Dangerous Practice. We should rather leave <HI>Secret Things</HI> unto GOD, and unto the Discoveries of the <HI>Great Day</HI>! In|deed, if a Mans Life and Conversation <HI>were as becomes the Gospel,</HI> we are not positively and ab|solutely
<PB N="13" REF="002563_0016_0FDB71C179909280">
to say, <HI>That he is Damned,</HI> though he killed him self: Bccause we know not but that he might be at <HI>that Time</HI> under some <HI>Distraction</HI>: And it is not Impossible, but that GOD may suffer <HI>Satan</HI> to Possess, and Torment, and Kill the <HI>Bodies</HI> of some, whose <HI>Souls</HI> may yet be <HI>Saved in the Day of the Lord.</HI> Yet on the other hand; If there were no sign of <HI>Distraction,</HI> appearing be+fore they went to <HI>Destroy themselves,</HI> nor any Evidence of <HI>Repentance</HI> after such attempts; we should not say, <HI>Such Persons are gone to Heaven:</HI> Lest by being <HI>Over-Charitable</HI> to the <HI>Dead,</HI> we be|come <HI>Cruel</HI> to the <HI>Living.</HI> The saying, <HI>Such Per|sons are Saved,</HI> may Occasion and Encourage others to do the like, and the <HI>Everlasting Destructi|on</HI> of Bodies and Souls follow upon it.</P>
<P>USE 3. <HI>BEWARE of this Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>ONE would think, there should be no great Need of such an EXHORTATION; To call upon men, <HI>To do themselves no Harm!</HI> Since there is in every man, a Principle of <HI>Self-Preser|vation.</HI> Yet there is too much <HI>Occasion</HI> for it. One <HI>Self-Murder</HI> makes way for Another. <HI>Sauls</HI> did for that of his <HI>Armour Bearer.</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>IT is a Lamentable Thing, that in a <HI>Place</HI> of so much Light, and Profession as <HI>This,</HI> it should be said unto a <HI>Self-Murdering</HI> Devil; &mdash; <HI>Thou shalt Perswade, and Prevail also!</HI> &mdash; That in such a <HI>Place,</HI> there should be any Need of in|sisting on such a Subject! &mdash; Yet there has been so; and there <HI>is</HI>! Above four Years ago, I saw Occasion to insist on a subject of this Importance,
<PB N="14" REF="002563_0017_0FDB71C302A90F90">
because within the space of but <HI>Five Weeks,</HI> there had been <HI>Five Self-Murders</HI>! The Lord Knows how many others may be Tempted at <HI>This Time,</HI> unto the like. I am not without Ap|prehensions, That the Bloody <HI>Lion,</HI> who <HI>goes a|bout seeking whom he may devour,</HI> may be let loose among the Flock; And therefore I thought it my Duty to withstand him, with <HI>the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of GOD</HI>; Not knowing, but that I may by such means rescue Poor Creatures out of his hands!</P>
<P>MY Advice on the Occasion is This.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> BE <HI>Humbled</HI> in the sight of GOD. Be <HI>Humbled</HI> for <HI>All</HI> thy Sins. &mdash; And be <HI>Humbled</HI> under <HI>Temptations</HI> to <HI>This</HI> Sin. &mdash; Be <HI>Humbled,</HI> as long as thou hast a Day to Live. Because they have not been <HI>Humbled, Satan</HI> has been let loose upon some with greater Violence. When a Sin has been <HI>Repented</HI> of, there will not now be so much <HI>Danger</HI> of that Sin, as there was before.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> BEWARE of <HI>such Sins</HI> as may Pro|voke the Holy and Righteous GOD, to leave thee unto <HI>This</HI> most Horrid Evil.</P>
<P>BEWARE of <HI>Pride.</HI> When Men will rather not be at all, than be what GOD would have them to be; What Cursed <HI>Pride</HI> is that!</P>
<P>THIS Produces <HI>Murmurings</HI> at the Providence of GOD; and causes People to say; 2 King. VI 33. <HI>What should I Wait for the Lord any longer?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="002563_0018_0FDB71C70CDA8AE8">BEWARE of <HI>Self Confidence.</HI> Be sensible of thy Weakness; <HI>Let him that Stands, take heed lest he fall</HI> Be not <HI>Confident</HI> of thy <HI>own Strength</HI> to Encounter the <HI>Adversary.</HI> If GOD should let <HI>Satan</HI> loose upon thee, he'll be too hard for thee.</P>
<P>BEWARE of an Heart glued unto <HI>the World.</HI> When <HI>the World</HI> is a Mans <HI>Idol,</HI> he will rather part with his very <HI>Life, [with his own hands give it away!]</HI> than part with <HI>the World.</HI></P>
<P>BEWARE of <HI>Unbelief.</HI> &mdash; Distrust not the <HI>Fa|therly Care</HI> of thy Heavenly <HI>Father</HI></P>
<P>BEWARE of <HI>Despair</HI>; 1 Thes. V.8. <HI>Putting on for an Helmet, the Hope of Salvation.</HI> Say not, <HI>The Day of Grace is over with me.</HI> &mdash; Say not, <HI>I have Sinned Unpardonably</HI>! &mdash; Vain Imagina|tions.</P>
<P>BEWARE of the more <HI>Heinous Crimes</HI>; which are in a special Manner GOD-Provoking Evils. The <HI>Sins against Nature</HI> are so. Some that have been Guilty of such Sins, in Secret, and have not Repented of them; GOD has for such Things left them to <HI>This,</HI> which is a <HI>Sin against Nature</HI> too! [See <HI>Voetii Disp.</HI> ubi supra.]</P>
<P>THERE are other <HI>Atrocious Crimes</HI>; whereof This has been the Consequence. &mdash; <HI>Iudas</HI> and <HI>Pilate,</HI> are two fearful Examples of it! &mdash;</P>
<P>Finally; BEWARE of <HI>Backslidings</HI> from GOD, and from good Beginnings in Religion. Re|member that Word; Hos. VIII.3. <HI>He hath cast off the thing that is Good; the Enemy shall pursue him.</HI> Some have <HI>left off</HI> Prayer in their Families; <HI>Left off</HI> their Attendence on Lectures; <HI>Left off</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="002563_0019_0FDB71CB1156ACC8">
Godly Exercises which they have been used unto. Therefore the <HI>Enemy</HI> of their Souls is let loose upon them; and he <HI>Pursues</HI> them, even to <HI>Self-Destruction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly. RESIST</HI> the Tempter. Tis the Counsil; Jam. IV.7. <HI>Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash; How, <HI>Resist</HI> Him? Do it by <HI>Crying</HI> to GOD. &mdash; If the <HI>Avenger</HI> pursue thee, fly to a CHRIST, as the <HI>City of Refuge. Resist the Devil!</HI> &mdash; the next Words are, <HI>Draw nigh to GOD.</HI></P>
<P>BUT then, Employ the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, for the <HI>Resisting</HI> of the Temptation. &mdash; It was <HI>Luthers</HI> Method. &mdash; Yea, our JESUS has given us a Pat|tern of it; &mdash; <HI>It is Written!</HI></P>
<P>DO one thing more, Discover the <HI>Temptations</HI> of the Devil. Make a <HI>Discovery,</HI> not unadvised|ly unto all the World; but unto some <HI>Faithful Minister,</HI> or unto some other <HI>Able Christian.</HI> One that cut his own Throat a while ago, said be|fore his Expiration; <HI>O! That I had Told, how I was Tempted! If I had, I believe I should never have come to This!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly. ABOVE All,</HI> a True <HI>Faith</HI> is to be Laboured for. By <HI>Faith</HI> Embrace an offered SA|VIOUR; This will keep thee from the <HI>Destroy|er.</HI> Being by <HI>Faith,</HI> safe in the Hands of thy Saviour, the <HI>Devil</HI> shall not pluck thee out of those hands. Tis directed; Eph. VI.16. <HI>Above
<PB N="17" REF="002563_0020_0FDB71CC67B66990">
all, take the shield of Faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery Darts of the Wicked One.</HI> As by <HI>Faith</HI> we obtain a <HI>Victory</HI> over <HI>the World</HI>; [1 Joh. V.4.] So we obtain a <HI>Victory</HI> over <HI>Satan</HI> too. He has not such Power over a true <HI>Believer,</HI> as he has over <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>ACT <HI>Faith</HI> on the <HI>Victory</HI> of thy SAVIOUR over <HI>Satan</HI>; Hoping and Looking for a share in <HI>That</HI>!</P>
<P>AND by <HI>Faith,</HI> Look up unto thy SAVIOUR, as unto one who <HI>knows how to Succour the Tempted.</HI> &mdash;</P>
