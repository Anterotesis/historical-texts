<HEAD>A Review of the State of the <HI>British Nation,</HI> Vol. 7. Numb. 14. Page 53.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TUESDAY, May 2. 1710.</HEAD>
<P>I Suppose Every body that know any thing of the Author of this Paper, knows, That when he having some Years ago Travell'd a Long Journey, and was carry'd up into the Lunar World in a well known Engine, contriv'd for Ele|vations for our famous <HI>High Church</HI> Men, and which was Call'd a <HI>Consolidator;</HI> at his return he gave the World some account of his Curious Observations.&mdash;But one Story he never yet told, and which seems reserv'd to the present occasion.&mdash;Be it Known to you all then, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">to the World in the

Moon, as I was passing thro' a great City a|bout my Lawful Occasions&mdash;<HI>What my busi|ness was there, is Nothing to any Body:</HI> But I found the People in a great hurry, drag|ging a poor Taylor away to their Courts of Justice.&mdash;<HI>Lord have mercy upon the poor man thought I,</HI> what will become of him? For he Look'd to me Just as an English Presby|terian would do if he were got into the hands of the high Church rabble; <ABBR>(viz.)</ABBR> Like a Man that Expected to be Murther|ed by them. Being mightily Concern'd you may be sure, to see the poor Man us'd thus, <HI>I Enquir'd who he was,</HI> and what was the Crime for which he was thus treated&mdash;I met with many relations Differing from one another about him, <HI>For the Peo|ple there tell the same Story a great many ways</HI> Just as they do here, <HI>as the humour takes them;</HI> but not to trouble you with several Relations of the Thing, the Substance of the Mans Case, it seems, was thus. The Man as I told you was a <HI>Taylor</HI> by his Trade; Now you are to understand, that tho' I did not find there was any of that foolish use|less sort of People call'd <HI>Poets</HI> there, yet they have <HI>their way</HI> of Satyrizing &amp; Ridicu|ling the Follies and Vices of the Place, as well as in other Countries; and it seems the <HI>Taylors</HI> are the Satyrs&mdash;for when any
<PB N="3" REF="002281_0003_0FDAE3D59E321A40">
Man, or Body of Men have play'd the Fool, or the Knave, or the Coward, or the Drun|kard, or any Vicious prank, he that has a mind to Lampoon him, goes to a Taylor, and gets <HI>such a Coat made</HI> as such People are ge|nerally condemn'd to wear upon Publick Days, who upon Tryal are found Guilty of such or such respective Crimes: this Coat is carried about the Streets and hang d up, or shew'd particularly at or near the House of the Person, and is easily known by the Dimensions and Figures made upon it, who it <HI>belongs to:</HI> and it is call'd in their Lan|guage a <HI>Thocacterraca,</HI> in <HI>English,</HI> a <HI>Repre|senter</HI> or a Character Coat. But you must remember too, that there are Strict Laws, any Taylor making these Coats for Persons innocent of the Follies Described; &amp; when any Transgress that way, they are severely Punish'd especially when they make a Coat for a Man, and upon trying it on, it does not fit him. On the other hand, oftentimes it happens, that when a Man makes a <HI>Cha|racter Coat</HI> for one Man, it fits <HI>another,</HI> and sometimes a <HI>great many.</HI> This is owing partly to the Ignorance of the <HI>Taylor,</HI> who does not take his measure right, and part|ly by Fools and Knaves, being in that Coun|try very often much like one another, but more especially by the ridiculous Folly of
<PB N="4" REF="002281_0004_0FDAE3D681938C98">
some Men, who when they see a Coat made, tho' it be the most ridiculing, and most ex|posing thing in the World, they cannot for|bear, but they will be <HI>always</HI> trying it on, and endeavouring to make it fit themselves whether it will or no.&mdash;Nay they will stretch the Coat out of all manner or shape to see if they can make it fit them, quite contrary to the Taylors Design; as if know|ing themselves to be Fools they were de|sirous all the World should know it too. This is a great piece of Injustice to the <HI>Taylor,</HI> tho' perhaps it may be none to them|selves; for I cannot believe; <HI>but Every Man IS just AS much a Knave as he would have the World believe him to be.</HI>&mdash;Just thus it fared some Years ago, with the Author of the Paper, Called, <HI>The Review,</HI> in the World <HI>on this side the Moon,</HI> when he happened in a Paper to be panting out the Character of a State Mountebank, a City Hero, a Coward to his Cause, a Fool, a Knave, and a Deserter of his Friends. One said, <HI>that's at me;</HI> another, <HI>that's at me;</HI> and the like: Nay, that would not serve them, but they must bring in their Friends too; <HI>Who does he mean by that?</HI> and, <HI>Who does he mean by this?</HI> That's such a Lord, that blue List Man, is my L&mdash;and his Garter; That Deserter of his Friend, or

that empty headed Magistrate, is the L&mdash;M&mdash;r; that Litigious Impertinent is Mr. Hill&mdash;d; that High-Church Buffoon, is Par&mdash;n Hig&mdash;s, and the like; when it was far from the thoughts of the poor Author, to do any of these Gentlemen so much ho|nour.&mdash;In like manner exactly it hap|pened in the Moon; <HI>the Story is this:</HI></P>
<P>There had been some very Scandalous Fellow had done some ridiculous Thing, for which he deserv'd to be Expos'd, and some People had be spoke this Taylor to make a Coat for him; the Coat was wonderfully made indeed, every side of it was singular, as you turn'd it <HI>this way,</HI> it look'd <HI>one thing: that way</HI> another; to <HI>ones</HI> eye-sight it repre|sented <HI>one thing;</HI> to <HI>another,</HI> quite contrary; and all agreed, that never such a Coat was made before: If you turn'd it this way, it was a <HI>Fools Coat;</HI> that way, 'twas a <HI>Knaves Coat;</HI> on one side it represented a <HI>Lord Bishop;</HI> on the other side, a <HI>Lord Duke;</HI> on another, a <HI>Lord M&mdash;r;</HI> on another a <HI>Clergy Man,</HI> on another, a <HI>Thief:</HI> Worn this way it made a Man a <HI>States Man;</HI> that way, a <HI>Mountebank,</HI> that way a General that way a Coward; a strange Coat it was indeed, <HI>as ever I saw in my Life.</HI> The Man that bespoke it no sooner carried it along the Streets, <HI>as was usual in such Cases,</HI> but it
<PB N="6" REF="002281_0006_0FDAE3D987ABCE60">
rais'd a terrible Combustion in the Town; the People began to stare at one another, as if they were frighted&mdash;. The first that broke silence was a huge Tall Man, by his appearance a Man of Grandeur, for he had a blue List upon his Coat, which in that Country none but a few of the Prince No|bility are permitted to wear&mdash;<HI>What D&mdash;'s that?</HI> says he&mdash;a <HI>Villian</HI>&mdash;a <HI>Rogue&mdash;why that Coat's made for me;</HI> and up he runs to the poor Man and begins to bluster.&mdash;<HI>Pray my Lord, Good my Lord,</HI> says the Man, <HI>it is not made for your Highness,</HI> it was made for your Neighbour <HI>such a one:</HI> you lie you Villian says my Lord, it was made for me, and I'll have you Hang'd, <HI>if there were no more Taylors in all the Moon. Indeed my Lord</HI> says the Man again, it could not be made for you, for it will not <HI>fit your Lordship:</HI> I ll try that, says his Lordship, and <HI>if it does I'll have you Hang'd immediately.</HI></P>
<P>Upon which my Lord put the Coat on; but the poor Man was Confounded, when he saw, that with but the least stretching, it fitted his Lordship to a Hair.&mdash;And he expected nothing but Death. My Lord went away raging, in order to sent the Cri|minal Officers to take up the Man: but he might have sav'd himself the Labour, for the Coat was not carried much farther,
<PB N="7" REF="002281_0007_0FDAE3DB09C15850">
but one cry'd, <HI>That&mdash;has made this Coat for me;</HI> another said, no, <HI>'tis for me,</HI> and almost every body that saw it challenged the Coat: at last the chief Magistrate of the Town happen'd to come along, and he fell in a rage, and cry'd out with an Oath, <HI>the Coat was made for him</HI> whereupon he Immediately seized it, and carry'd it into a great Assembly of that City, which was then Sitting, to complain of the Affront. This Assembly is call'd in their Language the <HI>Momonciculoc:</HI> I will not pretend to Knowledge enough in the Lunar Language to Translate it; Some think it may resem|ble a <HI>Common Council.</HI>&mdash;Here he began to complain of the Affront, when of a sud|den a great Combustion rose among them in the Hall of the Assembly; one said <HI>the Coat is made for me,</HI> another said <HI>it is for me;</HI> and to be short, with my Story, no less than 114 of them Challeng'd the poor Man for bringing this Coat out to Expose <HI>them</HI> in <HI>particular.</HI> The Man was in great Distress,&amp; had no way at last to bring him|self out of this Broil, but by telling them the Name of the <HI>Taylor,</HI> who made the Coat: which having done, he made his Escape,&amp; the poor <HI>Taylor</HI> was sent for. The <HI>Taylor</HI> was a bold Fellow, &amp; fear'd no Colours: And Immediately went to them upon the first Summons; and being brought before them, they Examin'd him very strictly.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002281_0008_0FDAE3DEA6F21F90">And as near as I can remember, the Examination was as follows; he is brought into a large Closet, where they usually Examine Witnesses, and the Coat being shew'd him, the <HI>Clerk</HI> appointed to Examine him, began the following Dialogue.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you make this Coat Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Taylor,</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who was it to represent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was made to represent him that it represents Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But who is that Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I tell you Sir, says the Taylor briskly, him that it represents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but here are a great many Gentlemen who say it represents them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>What all of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, all of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's strange Men should be all K&mdash;s of like Dimensions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how say you, <HI>Was it made to represent them!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it represents them, <HI>it must be made</HI> to re|present them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But did you <HI>Design</HI> to represent them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you tell me of <HI>Designs,</HI> my design was to make the <HI>Coat.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But here is my Lord A&mdash;, he says the Coat represents him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>His he try'd it on, and <HI>does it fit him?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exactly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tis impossible&mdash;pray look on the Coat, the Coat is a <HI>Fools Coat,</HI> and his Lordship is too much something else to be a F&mdash;l.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then it fits my L&mdash;B&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>That can't be neither; for turn it and you'l see 'tis a <HI>Knaves Coat,</HI> and every body knows my L&mdash;cannot be a Knave, it is not in his Head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it may fit my Lord C&mdash;.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>No it can't neither for turn it again, and then 'tis a <HI>States-Man Coat</HI> and it is well known my Lord is no more a States-Man than he is a Conjurer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but <HI>they may think it fits them.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their Guilt may do much, but 'tis not good manners in me to think so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but what say you to the rest of the Gentlemen that Challenge it? pray give them Satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, as to the 114 Gentlemen belonging to the Great Hall, if it fits them all I cannot help it, they may take it among them, and then every one will have his share&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> strange thing a Man cannot Dress up a Monkey but every one calls him Cousin.</P>
</SP>
<P>&mdash;And with this T. threw the <HI>Coat</HI> down in the middle of the Hall.</P>
