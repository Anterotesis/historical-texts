<P>SEEING thou art the undoubted assertor, supporter and protector of all our religious and civil liberties, neither the world nor you will, I presume, think the following Poem unaptly ad|dress'd to so distinguish'd a character&mdash;Is it not you who have always boldly stood in defence of the liberties of this people against the encroachments of the prerogative, or the evil designs of wicked and corrupt men to destroy them?&mdash;Is it not you who have council'd again and again a prudent acquiescence to that greatest of blessings the S&mdash;p A&mdash;t, rather than a bold and noble opposition, like an un|common patriot <HI>not</HI> preferring your own interest to the loss of your country's love?&mdash;Is it not you who with a patriotism unparalleled propos'd and supported the bold and manly word <HI>Privilege,</HI> against the pusillanimous one, <HI>Rights,</HI> in a certain spirited address?&mdash;Is it not you who contriv'd, fram'd and got pass'd into a law the W-rd-n A--t, by which agreeable to the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, we are <HI>not</HI> pharisaically deny'd the free use of the air and our limbs, or the free enjoyment of the benign influence of the Sun which shines as bright on that day, which is set apart for social worship and religious converse, as on any other?&mdash;Is it not you who in a populous assembly asserted in support of the same Act, that the Sabbath was <HI>no where</HI> so remissly kept as in this town, an assertion as remarkable for its truth as for the unhypocritical gravity with which it was de|livered?&mdash;In short you are so continually exerting your abilities in defence of our just rights, liberties and immunities both religious and civil <HI>in this way,</HI> that it would be endless to enumerate them&mdash;I shall therefore take my leave of you with wishing, that the just re|ward of such unfeign'd regard for religion and your native country, without one interested view to popularity or HONOR, <HI>which you have experienced in this life</HI> may prepare you for the smiles of Him who abhors hypocrisy, slavery and tyranny.&mdash;</P>
