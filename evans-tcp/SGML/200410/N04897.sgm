<P>I Have already given you a short Account of the Soils I wou'd recommend for the Culture of Flax and Flax-Seed, and shall now proceed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o inform you of the Manner in which I judge the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound ought to be dressed and ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, previous to it's being sown. And in order to this, I shall beg Leave to point out to you the Method that is practised in <HI>Zealand</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d <HI>Flanders,</HI> and to intersperse some Remarks upon it which may be of Service to our|selves.</P>
<P>I have not many Things to observe in Relation to Manures, The <HI>Dutch</HI> use Dung and Ashes, and sometimes h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dure in smaller Pion of Ground well fallowed.

This Particular is of great moment, and should always be attended to by the Husbandman, in the choice o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Manures: Weeds are destructive to all Crops, but are so espe|cially to Flax, which suffers greatly from them, both in it's Goodness and it'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Quantity.</P>
<P>In the Tillage of the Ground I shall be more minute, because I am a|fraid there lie some Prejudices against the Method I design to recommend, which nothing can so effectually remove, as an exact Account of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Flemish</HI> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dry in this particular.</P>
<P>In <HI>Zealand,</HI> where the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ands are such as I think best for Flax, deep, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wet and clay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, they take two different Methods to bring them into prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Order.

After proper Dunging, and two or more Plough|ings, they take a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rop of Corn off their Lands; the next Year they plant them with Madder, which remains two Years in the Ground; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Year they sow Flax in it. By these means the Ground is well broke: For, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the two Ploughings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or the Corn-crop, and the natural Fermentation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Dung, with several additional Plowings, sometimes five bestowed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Madder, together with many more to earth it up as it grows; there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> afte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> these the digging of the Ground to take it up; all which reduce the Soil to such a Degree of Fineness, as I believe is seldom equalled in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Country.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="006127_0003_1027EF965D76B980">
Our Farmers will be apt to imagine, that Land prepared in this manner would answer any Purposes of Husbandry. Nevertheless, the <HI>Zealanders</HI> themselves prefer the former Methods of fallowing and frequent ploughing as the best, to raise a valuable Crop of Flax The clinging together of the Clay, in the two Years that the Madder stands upon it, and the Quantity of Nourishment drawn off by that P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ant, leave even those rich and well till'd Lands poorer than they would chuse to have them for their Flax. 'Tis only from the great Benefit they receive by planting Madder, that they are led in|to the latter practice, which, upon the whole turns to a good Account; tho' as far as the Flax alone is concerned, 'tis not equal to the former.</P>
<P>To confirm what I have now advanced, 'tis observable, that in those parts of <HI>Flanders,</HI> where they have Veins of Clay, as partic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">larly about <HI>Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tray</HI>&punc; they sow their Flax upon Leigh Grounds immediately after a Summer and Winter Fallow: As they do not deal in Madder, Flax <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> first Crop, and they prepare the Soil for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by many successive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">loughings.

<P>We are told, that in <HI>Ireland</HI> good Crop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Flax have been had from one Ploughing, on Leigh Grounds. For my own part, I much doubt if ever we have had what would be esteemed a good Acr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Flax in <HI>Zealand</HI> or <HI>Flan|ders.</HI> I declare I never could see one; and I take the Reason to proceed from our Ignorance in the Choice of proper Soil, and Negligence in giving it the proper Tillage. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">deed, were I to give my Opinion freely, I think we have hitherto been greatly defective in almost all the Branches of Hus|bandry; particularly, we have tilled our Lands but superficially before they have been sown. Our Grounds designed for Wheat have not been laboured, as those in neighbouring Countries generally are; and our Crops have been pro|portionably sma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l. Nevertheless, even upon them there has been more Expence and Pains bestowed, than have been allowed the Ground laid out for Flax. Surely, it is Time to rouse ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">selves from this inactive state! Shall we, who almost depend intirely on the Linnen Manufacture, indulge our Sloth and In|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olence at so dear a Rate, and neglect the tilling of our Lands in a proper, tho' somewhat more laborious manner; when not only the public Wel|fare would be promoted by it, but the private Advantage arising from Flax and Flax-Seed would so vastly exceed what may be expected from any other Harvest? No Farmer would sow Wheat in the careless manner in which we have hitherto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">own Flax, and expect a tolerable Crop; and certainly Flax will bear the Expence of many Plowings and Fallowing much better than ei|ther Wheat or Barley.</P>

<P>WHen the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and is brought into proper Order, by the Tillage described in my last Letter, the Husbandman's next care must be to fit it for the Seed. This is done in <HI>Zealand,</HI> by laying it out in broad flat Ridges, divided by small <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">renches. The Ridges are generally fifty, sixty, nay sometimes seventy Feet broad, and the Trenches two or three Feet deep, and a Foot and a half wide. By these Means, the Lands are kept in a proper Degr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of Moisture; the broad flat Ridge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> retain enough to preserve them from growing dry, and the Trenches carry off whatever is superfluous. This Practice I beg Leave ear|nestly to recommend; and, by the Time our Husbandmen have tried it, I am bold to say, they will not find that Danger in wet Clays, which they ap|prehend from them. The Trenches w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll carry off all that Water, which might scald, or otherwise prejudice the Flax; and when that is done, the re|maining Moisture, which in high round Ridges is too soon exhausted, is of absolute Necessity to secure a valuable Crop. The <HI>Flemish</HI> Farmers are so thoroughly convinced of this, that in their light and drier Soils, they make no Trenches, but commonly lay down whole Fields, as flat and even as a Bowling-Green; and this in order to retain all the Moisture they can get, and thereby protect their Crop from the Dryness and Heat of Summer, I have now finished what I think necessary to be said concerning the Choice of Soils, and the Manner of preparing them for Flax. Upon the whole, there is no Room to doubt, that were the Method I have pointed at diligently pur|sued, the succeeding Profit and Advantage would abun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">antly reward all the add<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tional Labour and Expence of the Farmer in this Article.</P>
<P>I proceed at present to give you my Thoughts upon the Nature and Pro|perties of good Flax-Seed, and the Time and Manner of sowing it. No|thing is plainer, than that the Farmer cannot be too nice in the Choice of his Seed, since the Value of his Crop must chiefly depend upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Goodness. In general, the shortest, plumpest, thickest, oilyest, heaviest Seed, of a bright brown Colour, is esteemed the best. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Boor is very exact in examining these several Qualities, and makes his Trials in the following Manner. In order to discover it's Thickness, he takes a large Handful, and squeezes it until the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ges appear plainly between his Finger and Thumb; for it is intirely from the Edge he forms his Judgment in that particular. To try it's Weigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, he throws a Handful into a Glass of Water; if it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nks soon, he is sure it is heavy and good; if otherwise, he judges it unfit for his Purpose. To examine it's O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lyness, he throws a Quantity into the Fire; if it blaze soon, and crackle much, he thinks he may depend upon it. After all, he sometimes sows it in a Hot-bed, and in short, leaves no Method un|tried, which will insure him that his Seed is of the best Kind.</P>
<P>I have only mentioned these minute Circumstances, to shew how curious we ought to be in the Choice of our Seed.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006127_0005_1027EF9E82573E40">
What I have now to add is an Advice of great Importance to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hus|bandmen, and particularly so to the Flax Farmer; namely, not to depend on a Succession of good Seed from the same Soil. The best Clays will not preserve the Seed from degenerating by Degrees, if it be sown for a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y con|siderable Time on the same Kind of Soil, from which it has been sav'd. It loseth every where something of it's Goodness by that Management; and though less in Clays than in any other Ground, yet even in those it will fi|nally decay. For that Reason it is necessary in all Soils to change the Seed; and the more frequently it is done, the better, The common Rule in this case is, to buy from lighter Grounds to sow on Clay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and to buy from clayey Soils to sow on lighter Grounds; and the Rule, well understood, is undoubtedly a good one. But as I am perfectly convinced that light Grounds do not afford good Seed, I must beg Leave to explain the Rule at large, and prevent all Mistakes about it. Where the Farmer intends to raise a good Crop of Flax-Seed, he must avoid light, dry, and sandy Grounds. They are never to be used with any other purpose, than to procure fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Flax, and always disappoint the Farmer when he hopes for good Seed from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m. 'Tis not therefore those light Lands that can be dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nded on for C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ange. The Farmer who expects good Seed, must confine himself to Clays of diffe|rent sorts, which will afford sufficient Room for Change. The Seed raised in the stiffer Kind will be best sown on the loos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e lower, which come rearest to a Loam; and the Produce of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hose again will serve&punc; for pro|per Seed on the stiffest and the deepest. The smal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">est Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iation in the Na|ture of the Soil is sufficient to preserve the Seed; and Nob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y need be in|form'd, that Clays differ much from one another. In <HI>Ireland</HI> we have them almost of all Kinds; and therefore can be under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o Temptation to have Re|course to lighter Soils, which never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mprove the Seed; but on the contrary, constantly impair it. I have been the more particular on this Point; because the common Prejudices entertained in this Country against Clays, appear to me of very pernicious consequence. They so materially affect our Linnen trade, that no Pains can be bestowed to more Advantage, than those whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are di|rected to remove them. I shall therefore add, to what I have hitherto ob|served from the Practice of other Countries, a remarkable Instance of the Usefulness of clayey Soils in this Kingdom. 'Tis known, that the <HI>Corcus</HI> Lands in the County of <HI>Limerick,</HI> are deep&punc; strong Clays. An experiment was made some time ago, to determine what Effect they would have upon decay'd Seed. In order to this, a Barrel of the most degenerate Flax-Seed that could be got in the North, was carried to <HI>Munster,</HI> and sown in those Lands. There it recovered, and produced very good Flax; the Seed re|turned by those rich stiff Clays was as good as could be used, and improved beyond all Expectation; insomuch, that the Seed sent ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k to the North, and again sown there, afforded as good Flax and Flax-Seed, as any from abroad. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Experiment proves, that we may have good Seed of our own; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Confirmation of it, 'twill be proper to inform the Reader, that the Gentlemen of the Society sow'd equal quantities of four different Kinds of Seed, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> they could get of each, in the same Land, and with the same Culture; <HI>Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tation</HI> Seed, <HI>Riga, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Seed; and that the Crop produced by that of our own Growth, was considerably preferable to the rest.</NOTE> The Fact is notorious, and was communicated to the Public by

<P>I shall conclude this Letter by observing, that since the Choice of Seed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Point of the highest Moment, 'tis a manifest Absurdity to depend upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> reign Markets.

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE next Article to be considered by the Flax-Farmer, is the Quanti|ty of Seed which he ought to sow. And here it will be proper to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|serve, that there will be always a remarkable Difference in the Produce, in proportion to the different Quantities which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">own. For, should a smaller Parcel of good Seed be made use of, it will yield a plentiful Crop of good Seed and strong Flax: But should the Farmer sow a larger Quantity of the same Goodness, his Flax would indeed be finer, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncrease great, but then his Seed would be much less valuable. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> who are not at all apprehensive of wanting Seed, generally practise the latter Method. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their Case differs widely from ours, their Manufacture being arrived to Ma|turity, ours in it's Infant State; what may be wise in them, may be impr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|dent in us. Were I therefore to advise, I should choose to recommend the former Method, until we had brought our Seed to an equal Degree of Per|fection and Plenty. Upon the Whole, a great deal must be referred to the Discretion of the Farmer, and an Allowance made for the Difference of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> equally well laboured; for a good Soil will cherish a large Quantity of Soil, and afford it all that Nutriment which is necessary to bring both Seed and Flax to Perfection; whilst a like Portion of Seed would dwindle and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> a hungry Soil, and at last return a miserable Crop. As to the partic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> Quantity of Seed, necessary for a determinate Portion of Land, I shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>Every Flax-Farmer, I believe, is sufficiently apprized, that good Weather and a wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m Season are very necessary for saving Flax-seed, and watering and grassing Flax. And yet we do not seem to have sufficiently attended to this particular in <HI>Ireland</HI>; otherwise we should not, as is generally done, defer the sowing of Flax-seed until the Spring is so very far advanced. In order to rectify this Error, it would be adviseable to sow the Seed the first good Sea|son in <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rch,</HI> for then in all probability it will be ripe the latter End of <HI>June,</HI> or Beginning of <HI>July</HI>; and the Farmer by these Means w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll have Time e|nough before him, for the purposes abovementioned. If th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Method is pur|sued, another considerable Advantage will be gained; a good Crop of Tur|nips may be had upon those Flax-Grounds that very Season, which would otherwise continue waste <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd useless the Remainder of the Yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>Since I am engaged in giving Directions for sowing of Flax, I hope I shall be forgiven a short Digression, which may be very useful to the Farmer; when he designs to lay down his Lands, he may safely sow Clover or other Grass-seeds, a few D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ys after his Flax seed. The Clover is so far from pre|judicing Flax, that it is ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erved to be of remarkable service to it. It is pro|bable that it preserves the Dew and Rain about it's Roots, and shelters the Ground around them from the Heat of the Sun; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e that the cause or not, long Experience has demonstrated, that they thrive perfectly well to|gether, the Clover producing a good Crop of Grass soon after the Flax is pull'd. This Method is constantly practised in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI> with good Success, and therefore I can recommend the Use of it amongst our|selves.</P>
<P>I have very little to observe about the Manner of sowing Flax seed, I shall just take Notice, that the Seeds man must go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he Ridge in a strait Line, and sow with his right Hand, and then return in the same Path, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow with his left Hand; for it is of Moment that he should sow evenly. Some Days af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er this, if he intends to lay down his Grounds, he must sow his Grass seeds, and cover them by Bush-harrowing and Rolling; the Manner of doing which is so well known already, that I need not enlarge upon it. For the same Reason I need say little upon weeding the Flax: It must be done at the time when it is between two and five Inches high. The Treading upon it with the Heels of Shoes will prejudice the Flax, but sitting upon it will do it no Harm.</P>
<P>I now come to the Consideration of an Article of the greatest consequen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to the Linnen Manufacture; namely, the proper Season of pulling the Flax. And here, Gentlemen, you must bear with me if I enlarge with some Warmth upon this Subject. I have prejudices to encounter as pernicious as they un|happily

<P>In the mean Time, as I wou'd willingly pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ade myself, that all among us are not r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">solved against Conviction, I shall desire those who are wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ling to hear Reason, to reflect with Seriousness on the unhappy Circumstances we lie under from the Perverseness of our Farmers. We are dependent not only up|on foreign Markets, but upon the Winds and Waves, for the fundamental Part, the very <HI>Primum</HI> of our Manufacture Every Year the Trade, and consequently the Support of the whole Nation, is, in one main Branch of it exposed to all the Hazards of the Sea; we lie at the Mercy of it in a Point of infinite Importance; and whether our Flax Dressers, our Spinners, our Weavers, and our Bleachers, shall be useful to their Country by their Labour, or become a Burthen to it, and beg their Bread about the Streets, depends in a great measure upon that treacherous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lement. This very Season <HI>Ireland</HI> has lost above five thousand Barrels of Flax-seed upon that fearful Chance which we every Year must run 'til we grow wiser, and learn to provide our|selves with a certain and independent Supply of good Seed from our own Lands.</P>
<P>This Consideration alone is of Weight sufficient, one would think, to bring about a Reformation among those who are capable of Reflection: Were it true that the Flax is in some Degree impaired by standing 'til the Seed i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ripe, it would be, notwithstanding, a wild and inconsistent Conduct, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Hazard of the Whole, to avoid a single Inconvenience in our St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple. But the Case in Fact is otherwise:&mdash;The Flax becomes more valuable both

from it's Quantity and Quality, by being allowed to ripen. Upon a mode|rate Computation, the Farmer who pulls green loseth, besides his Seed, more than half of his Flax crop; his weak green Flax breaks under the dres|sing, runs to Tow, and disappoints him of his Quantity; and what is still of more Importance, the little he has is every Way inferior to what it would have been, had he suffer'd it to stand 'til it were ripe. In point of Streng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, no Man can be so b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ind, as to question the Truth of this Assertion. Maturity is full as requisi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to make the Fibres strong in Plants, as it is in Animals; and it were as good Philosophy to expect Vigour and Robustness from the Gristles of a Child, as to hope for Strength and Toughness in the Fibres of green Flax. In Respect to Fineness, I know our Manufacturers will be against me, and give the Preference to unripe Flax, because it splits with little La|bour; but, if we may depend upon the Practice of the <HI>Flemings,</HI> they are undoubtedly mistaken. 'Tis the peculiar Care of those experienced Manu|facture<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, to let that stand longest, which they intend for the finest Goods; they even venture the shedding of the Seed, to have it as ripe as possible, when it is to be wrought up into the better Kinds of their Cambricks, and their Laces: And surely repeated Trials would by this Time have convinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d them of their E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ror, it ripe Flax were as coarse and stubborn as we think it. I have not Room to enlarge upon this Head at present, and therefore shall beg Leave hereafter to resume the Argument, and to shew at large, that the ripest Flax, as it is always the strongest, becomes also, by proper D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">essing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, both the finest and the softest.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS of so much Importance to this Kingdom, that our Flax should not be pulled too soon, that I could wish to add more particular Direc|tion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to what has been already said upon this Subject; but it is so nice a Thing to describe Colours, on which the Farmer's Judgment must depend in a great Measure, that I fear I must leave him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is own Experience, the best Instructor in these Cases. In general, when the Field appears of a bright Yellow, inclining a little to the Lemon Colour, 'tis Time to try the Seed of a few Stalks, which, when arrived to it's Maturity, will be found firm and full like that of other Plants, and of a light brown Colour. The <HI>Dutch</HI> wait 'til the Boles or Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s are ready to crack, and, in some of the ripest Stalks begin to open. Upon the Whole the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st Direction I can give is, to let your Flax stand as long as is consistent with the Safety of your Seed; for, if that be once secured from shedding, your Seed and Flax will be the better.</P>
<P>In the Arti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le of making Flax in the Field, the Practice of <HI>Ireland</HI> differs so little from what is customary in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> that I need not take up much Time in giving Directions upon that Head. I would fain hope that for the future, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew will be so much their own Enemies, as to pull their Flax before it is fully ripe; and when it is so, I have already described.
<PB N="10" REF="006127_0010_1027EFAC400704E0">
The Farmer's next Business is to make it, which is done by taking as much as he can easily grasp with both his Hands, and gently laying it on the Ground with the Heads pointing southward; he then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">kes another Hand|ful and lays it upon the former, not directly across but somewhat slanting, in order to keep the Heads or the Flax still exposed to the South, and thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> repeats until he raises the Heap a Foot and a half high. By this Disposition the Flax receives the full Benefit of the Sun and Air, and is preserved from the Damage it would sustain by Rain. This is the Method constantly practised in uncertain dropping Seasons; but should the Weather be settled and very good, and the Farmer desirous of making his Flax expeditiously, all he has to do is to lay it in Handfuls on the Ground, and turn it frequently, carefully observing to keep the Ends regular. If the Weather continues fa|vourable, twelve or fourteen Days generally suffice for this part of the Far|mer's Work; but if it be showery, the Flax must lie in the little Heape be|fore described about eighteen or twenty Days, and sometimes longer, until it be sufficiently made, and then it is bundled up for Carriage.</P>
<P>It has been recommended to our Farmers, in some Instructions published with your Approbation, and made a Condition of their Contracts with the Linnen-Board, That they should stack the Flax immediately from the Field, and keep it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Stack until the beginning of <HI>December.</HI> This Practice, I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, is attended with cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">derable Inconven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">encies, and does not answer the good Ends proposed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y it; I shall therefore b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to offer my Reasons against it here, and I hope it will be understood as a Proof of my high Regard for the Society, that I address them to you, Gen|tlemen, who, I am satisfied, have the Information and Good of the Public principally at Heart, and will chearfully encourage any Thing which contri|butes to it, tho' it should unluckily run counter to some of your Directions published with the same Design.</P>
<P>As I have hitherto rested chiefly on the Authority of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Fle|mings,</HI> who must from long Experience be suppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d perfectly acquainted with every Branch of the Linnen Manufacture, I should not presume to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Society's Directions, if I were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot very sure that I have those experien|ced Artists on my Side. From whatever Hands you received your former Informations, I must assure you, Gentlemen, that upon a strict and particu|lar Enquiry, I found the Fact quite otherwise. I saw no Signs of stacking or housing unrippled Flax in any part of <HI>Holland</HI>; and when I asked the Question, I was always answered in the Negative. And indeed, I am sur|prized how any one could be led into so unlikely a Mist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke, as to recommend stacking from their Practice, since it is notorious, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Holland</HI> the Flax is never stacked at all, either rippled or unrippled. I know no other Way of accounting for an Assertion so contrary to undoubted Facts, than by suppo|sing that the Persons on whose Information you depended have unwarily con|founded two very different Directions. 'Tis indeed the <HI>Dutch</HI> Practice and Advice not to separate the Seed from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ole, 'til some Time after it is p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l|led; but I am bold to say, that they neither delay rippling it themselves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or advise doing so to others. The Case, I have Reason to think, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the same in all Flax Countries. The Seed we have from <HI>Riga</HI> has undoubtedly not been stack'd. The Concern of their Magistrates to secure the Reputation of
<PB N="11" REF="006127_0011_1027EFAFEA53A9B0">
their Flax-seed makes them exceedingly careful, when the foreign Demands are answer'd, to call in the remaining Seed of that Season&punc; and to keep it for the Oil-Mills. We may therefore be confident, that the Seed we have from the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce is that of the immediately preceding Harvest, and by a necessary con|sequence, that it has not been stacked. Were it otherwise, those Northern Seas are generally frozen so early in the Year, that our Ships must fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l from thence unladen.

<HEAD>Reasons against the Stacking of <HI>FLAX, &amp;c. LETTER VI.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I have chiefly confin'd myself in the Course of these Letters to the Use of Arguments, drawn from the Practice of other Countries, I shall not engage very far in those of another Kind to shew the Disadvantages of stacking the Flax unrippled. I am indeed convinc'd, and so will every one I believe, who seriously considers it, that the Seed can receive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o Benefit from a sapless dry Stalk, which retains no Moisture, and consequently no Nourishment, if it has been made with proper Care. But as I have often wa|ved Considerations of this Kind, I hope to be excused by the more curious Observers upon Nature, if I continue to do so at present. There are Argu|ments against this Practice more obv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous to all Capacit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, and for that very Reason of more general Use. Upon these I choose to let the Matter rest, and beg Leave to insist upon each of them distinctly.</P>
<P>The Receipt inserted in the Society's former Instructions, to destroy Ver|min in the Stacks of unrippled Flax, is a sufficient Proof that they were a|ware of an Inconvenience in stacking the Seed and Flax together. They were sensible this Practice would invite Rats and Mice to make their Nests among the Flax, and accordingly prescrib'd a Remedy. I have not heard with what Success it has been tried, but I must beg Leave to think, 'twould be a more prudent Cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct to avoid the Evil, than to trust to an uncertain, and at best an i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">perfect Cure. The Vermin must make their Way to the Poison through the Flax, and cut and mangle it before they meet their Bane; and therefore, notwithstanding all Precautions, the Farmer is visibly a Suffer|er by this Method, and must lose a considerable Portion of his Flax. Should Vermin come at his Seed, when it is separated from the Stalk; which howe|ver is more easily prevented since they have no Concer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ents on the Floor, the Loss is only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the Seed; whereas the Damage in the Stack falls also on the Flax, and upon that Account is co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by greater.</P>
<P>There are other and greater Disadvantages atte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the stacking of our Flax unrippled. The Seed heats more easily in the Stack th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n on the Floor. The Evil is not so soon discovered, and the Remedy attended with more Labour and more Cost. It is too obvious to be insisted on, that you run double
<PB N="12" REF="006127_0012_1027EFB420741330">
Hazards of pernicious Damps, when you have both Stalks and Seed toge|ther. Nor is it less notorious, that notwithstanding all Precautions, the Heart of a large Stack may be considerably damaged before any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Heat appear; whereas, upon the Floor they immediately betray themselv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. And in the third particular, the Disproportion is still plainer: &mdash;A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cannot be thrown without shedding a great deal of Seed, nor rebu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lt without considerable Labour; whereas, airing your Boles on the Floor is done with little Trouble, and almost at no Expence. These are Inconveniencies inci|dent to this Method in all Seasons, and in unsettled Weather they become intolerable. Some Harvests are so wet, that it is hardly possible perfectly to make the Flax; and should the Farmer at such Times be prepossessed with the Necessity of stacking, he has scarce a single Chance to save his Crop. The least Damp, which is then almost unavoidable, will heat his Stack, which, by the Weight and Pressure of a large Quantity of Flax and Seed to|gether, fall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in too close to let in Air; while on the contrary the Seed rip|pled from the Flax, but preserv'd in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od or Bole, lies light and hollow, and may there ore, tho' it r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tain'd a little Moisture, be preserv'd from Da|mage, without any considerable pai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</P>
<P>The Delays which attend this practice afford another and an unanswer|able Argument against it. The watering of the Flax is prevented for one Seaso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and consequently every other Branch of Linnen Manufacture propor|tionably retarded. Hence the Benefit of a quick Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urn, one of the greatest Encouragements to Trade, is lost in some Degree to every Person concerned in our Staple, and intirely so to the poor Farmer. The Sale of his Flax and Seed being delayed 'til <HI>January,</HI> comes too late to pay his Rent, and defray the necessery Expence of preparing his Lands for the next Crop; or should he borrow to answer those Demands, he must pay an heavy Interest for his own, which eats out his little profit. Let us suppose a Farmer has twenty Acres under Flax, if the Land be good and well prepared, and the Season fa|vourable, his Crop at a moderate computation is worth five hundred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and consequently the half Year's Interest, which he loseth by bad Manage|ment, amounts to fifteen Pounds. Few Farmers can bear so considerable a Draw back upon their Profit, and I can see no Reason to encourage them to do it. The only shadow of an Argument in favour of this Method is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from a supposition that the Seed is the better for it; and this grounded upon the Farmer's practice in his Wheat, which he generally sows immediately from the Flail. But as it is impossible to assign any Reason for this Assertion from the Nature of the Thing, so the Presumption drawn from the practice of our Husbandmen is intirely built on a Mistake 'Tis not from Choice, but from Necessity, that the Farmer pursues that Method. The sowing Sea|son comes so close upon his Harvest, that he has no Time to spare; and if he will sow Wheat at all, he must do it from the Threshing-floor. In other Grains the ease is different, and so also is the practice; and I never heard that any understanding Husbandman objected to Seed of the same Season from it's being thresh'd too early. The Seed therefore, by any Thing th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|therto appears, is certainly not the worse for early rippling; and I must add, that the Flax itself is undoubtedly much the better. For immediate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which cannot be done without immediate rippling, is of considerable Imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|tance;
<PB N="13" REF="006127_0013_1027EFB740512188" MS="y">
the Bunn ferments with Ease, before it has had Time to harden&punc; and the Harle, by a necessary Consequence, comes out the stronger and the finer. The sole Design of watering the Flax is to rot the Bunn in some De|gree, that it may part more readily from the Harle; and the sooner the Flax can be brought into a proper State for that only End intended, 'tis certainly so much the better. When it remains a considerable Time in Water, the Harle itself ferments, suffers considerably in strength and softness, and at last will rot together with the Bunn. Too long watering therefore is evidently pernicious, and yet by slacking the Flax unrippled 'til the Winter, is really unavoidable; the Bunn by lying so many Months unwatered becomes hard and tough, adheres strongly to the Harle, and will not part from it without a long and violent Fermentation; which, tho' it be then inde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d by bad Ma|nagement become necessary, is however nothing the less destructive.</P>
<P>I must add that, independently of this, Autumn is the best watering Season. The prece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing Summer's Heat has then mellow'd and softened the Water; whereas in <HI>May</HI>; which is the Time of Year generally made use of by those that slack unrippled, it has hardly lost any thing of the Harshness contracted in the Winter.</P>
<P>And now, Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lemen, having gone through the several Branches of Flax-Husbandry, I sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l take my Leave of the Rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er for a While. The Obser|vations I have by me upon Flax Dressing are a Subject by themselves; and as I could wish, for t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Interest of the Manufacture, that Flax-farming and Flax dressing were different Employments, I choose for that very Reason <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eat of each of them ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt.</P>
<P>It would be a considerable Satisfaction to me, if I could hope that what I have already said could be useful to my Country. It has long given me great Concern to see our Flax-farmers afraid of using their best Lands, deep and heavy Clays, giving those they choose a slight and superficial Culture, losing their own Seed while they imported that of other Countries, and spoiling their Flax by keeping it unwatered all the Winter. I have therefore let my|self particularly against those Errors; and if I shall find that I have done it with Success, I shall think my Pains abundantly rewarded. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There have been many Objections started against this Letter, and many Arguments offered to support the practice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acking Flax unrippled, which have reach'd the Gentlemen of the Society.

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Letters publi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hed in your Papers, on the Culture of Flax and Flax-seed, have, from the great Success of them in <HI>Zealand,</HI> advis'd our Hus|bandmen to the Use of deep stiff Clays, as the fittest Lands for Flax. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in general, I take to be ratio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al Advice: B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t as the Nature of our Soil differs much from that of <HI>Zealand,</HI> and we have Variety of Loams not to be found there, I hope it may be useful to enlarge your Directions on that Head, and apply them more particularly to the Circumstances of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>According to some Naturalists there are many sorts of Soils, which differ from one another in their Ingredients, Weights, Colours, and Consistencies; but to take in at present the most co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">siderable D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fferences only, I conceive that all Earths may be conveniently reduced to two general Principles, Sand and Clay; and from the different Mixtures and Proportions of those two in|gredients, the great Variety of Soils easily accounted for. Under the Class of sandy Soils will be comprehended not only mere Sands, but all gravelly, stony, hazely, light, loose Soils which do not hold Water; and under Clay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> besides the stiffer Kinds properly so called, Marle, Chalk, and other binding Soils, which naturally retain it.</P>
<P>Neither Sands nor Clays are, separately taken, good vegetative Soils: But when mixed in due proportion, they become rich Loams, and afford the best of Crops; not indeed every Crop indifferently, but according to the several distinct proportions of Sand and Clay which they contain, some one and some another. D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ferent Plants require different Degrees of Stiffness, Lightness, Heat, and Moi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ture in the Soil; and therefore a proper Loam for one may be highly improper for another.</P>
<P>Those Soils which incline most to Sand are readily exhausted, and afford little Nourishment. Sand itself, which is no more than a Collection of small Pebbles, can yield none, and the Earth which is mixed among it, when in a small proportion, can't supply the large Dem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nds of a weighty Crop of Ve|getables.</P>
<P>Clayey Soils, on the contrary, are indeed nutritive all over, capable of be|ing broke into the smallest Particles, which become by their Minuteness the proper Food of Plants. But then they are apt to bind and cling, and in that State are as absolutely useless as the very Sands themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="006127_0015_1027EFBAA7DD3728">
Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se Defects, however different in their Cause, are therefore much alike in their Consequences; and, as I before affirmed, mere Clays are, as well as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Sands, naturally unfit for Vegetation.</P>
<P>But however, there is a considerable Difference between them. Sands are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all human Art intirely irreclaimable, without new making the whole Soil by mixing it with Clays, a Method commonly impracticable, and always in a high Degree expensive; whereas the stiffest Clays may be reduced into a Tilth by Labour, and the natural I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fluence of Frost and Sun and Air.</P>
<P>Thus the dry sandy Deserts of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> will remain Deserts while the World endures; whereas the deep stiff Clays of <HI>Zealand</HI> are by indefati|gable Industry, become rich and fertile Soils.</P>
<P>It is true indeed, that in <HI>Egypt</HI> the Soil is very sandy, and yet affords great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">antities of Corn and Flax, insomuch that that Country is now a Granary to the neighbouring Parts of the World, as it formerly was to the <HI>Romans</HI>; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this is owing to a natural Advantage which no Art can imitate.

Each of the other Kinds I shall speak to in their Order.</P>
<P>Gravelly Soils are generally dry, shallow, hungry, skully, apt to be scor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed up in a dry Summer, and consequently not fit for Flax. They may be usefully laid do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n in Sheep-Walks, the Staple being shallow, and the Grass <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and short; but for Flax or any other weighty Crop, they want both Strength and Moisture, without which neither Flax nor any other Seed sown <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in Spring and upon the Approach of Summer, can well thrive.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that in <HI>Livonia, Courland,</HI> and <HI>Muscovy,</HI> the Soil is light and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; but it is a sandy Loam mixed with great Quanti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies of Clay, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> different from our Gravels.

This brings them into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Loam of different Goodness, according to the Strength and Quanti|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> of the Manure; but however never equal to the natural Loams or Clays, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> never thoroughly fit for Flax.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="006127_0016_1027EFBE01E99BD8">
Clays are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be found in most parts of <HI>Ireland,</HI> they are naturally moist, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to them the Richnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of all our Soils is owing. Every other Soil being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in proportion to the Quantity of Clay that it contains. I have observed al|ready that they require laborious Tillage, I shall add here, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it; and when brought into a thorough Tilth, afford the richest Crops. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the same time it must be owned, that genuine, stiff, and unmixed Clays <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> seldom perfectly subdued without the Assistance of Manures. Sand, Gravel, or other Mixtures will facilitate their Culture, and lessen the strong Cohe|sion of their parts, which is otherwise too stubborn for the Patience of any but a <HI>Zealand</HI> Farmer.</P>
<P>'Tis therefore an Advantage that none of our Clays are intirely free from Sand, but incline all of them to Loams. These abound in several parts of the Kingdom, especially <HI>Leinster, Munster,</HI> and <HI>Connaught,</HI> where many of our Pastures consist of a deep, rich, black Mold, made up of a great pro|portion of Clay, broken and divided by a Mixture of some Sand. Of this sort are also the Corcus and Marsh Lands in the Counties of <HI>Limerick, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, Kerry,</HI> and <HI>Tipperary,</HI> which seem to be new Soils, made by the Rivers and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> washing down and lodging the fine particles of Clay, Sand and Shells, upon those Bottoms. 'Tis the skilful Husbandman's Endeavour to make ar|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ficial Loams by mixing Clays with Sands, or Sands with Clays; and to do this effectually requires a vast Expence: But here Nature has done the Work to our Hands, there is no Need of gathering Manures or making Composts for these natural Loams; nothing more is wanted than to give them proper Tillage. Without this indeed the best of them will not answer, and the rich|est Soils less than any other. Several have plowed up these Loams, and were greatly disappointed in the Produce: They trusted wholly to the Rich|ness of the Soil, and that very Richness was the cause of their Disappoint|ment: They neglected to give it proper Tillage, and when they expected a Crop of Corn or Flax, had little else but Grass. Natural Grass thrives so well in these rich Soils, that unless the Roots are carefully destroyed it springs up immediately, grows to a great Height, and gets the better of every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that's sown.</P>
<P>I mention this as an additional Argument for good Tillage, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ver be too much recommended to the Farmer; and I dare assure them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> repeated Trials, that nothing else but frequent Ploughings, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Fallowing, will remedy this Evil.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, it appears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y this short Survey of the Soils of <HI>Ireland</HI>&punc; that except our gravel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y light Grounds, they are all adapted by Nature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> successful Culture of Flax and Flax seed.

<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>LETTER VIII.</HI> Concerning the Rippling of <HI>FLAX.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FLAX-Dressing I always thought should be a separate Trade, carried on by Persons who made that alone their Livelihood, and by con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tant and assiduous Attendance endeavoured to attain that Dexterity and Readiness which is every where observable in <HI>Holland,</HI> but hardly any where to be met with in this Country. I am glad to find that I have your Au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hority to sup|port me in this Opinion, and I hope what you have lately published to that purpose will meet with the Regard it certainly deserves.</P>
<P>Before I go upon particulars, I beg Leave to observe, that the Business of the Flax dresser in <HI>Holland</HI> begins considerably before the Place I assign'd him in these Papers. 'Tis there the Rule, that the Husbandman concerns him|self no farther with his Crop after it is sown. The Flax dresser buys it stand|ing, weeds, pulls and saves it his own Way, and at his own Expence. This Custom, I imagine, it would be difficult to introduce among our Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple, and as I don't perceive a strict Necessity of conforming to their Practice in this Point, tho' some Advantages undoubtedly attend it, I choose to hint it only, and leave the Whole to the Discretion of the Reader, with this cursory Ob|servation to direct him; that the Farmer who makes his Flax, must provide Conveniencies at home to receive it from the Field; whereas, in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Method he is no ways encumbered with it, but discharged at once from all Care and Concern about it. This to him is a considerable saving, and can be no Hardship on the Flax-dresser; who, in either Way, to carry on his Business to purpose, must provide himself with proper Housing, and have Room sufficient to dispose of it.</P>
<P>But not to dwell any longer on this Head, where I see but little Hopes of prevailing;&mdash;I shall proceed upon a Supposition that he has sav'd his Flax in the Manner directed in my former Letters, and then sold it to the Dresser.&mdash; The first Business of the Flax-dresser is, in this Case, rippling or taking off the Boles. This is done with an Instrument in common Use, and too well known to need a Description. In <HI>Holland</HI> two Men work at the same Rip|ple, which is fix'd on the middle of a Bench, while they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it one at either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> opposite to each other. There they take stroke about, and draw their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> alternately through the Ripple, 'til it is clear'd of all the Boles. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> attended by two Boys or Women, who serve them with unrippled Flax, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tie that up in Bundles which has gone through this Operation, and by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gular Disposal of their Hands the whole is carrie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on with great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

<P>These are usefu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cautions, and deserve proper Not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce.

<P>'Tis not to be expected, at least 'til the common People of this Country learn more Diligence and Industry, that the Farmer should be as attentive as the Dresser to part and sort his Flax. Provided he g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts his Seed well off, and can fit his Flax for Sale, his Concern with it is at an End, and his Care extends no far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her: And yet it is of great moment to the Manuf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cture that the Flax be well sorted in the rippling.

One Part will still be harsh whilst the other is al|most rotten; and the Yarn, by a necessary Consequence, be damaged in a great Degree. In <HI>Holland</HI> they bestow peculiar Care upon the sorting, and the Women who attend the Ripplers have it especially in Charge. They are sensible that unr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pe Flax ferments with greater Ease, and in a shorter Time, than that which has stood to ripen; and that therefore if they are tied up to|gether to be watered, one or other must certainly be spoiled.

<P>The Arguments in favour of their Methods are to every Capacity so obvi|ous, that I might very well excuse mysel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om laying them before my Rea|de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.&mdash; However I can't forbear inserting them in the same plain Way in which they were convey'd to me by a blunt Boor, to whom I applied for In|forma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion.</P>
<P>The Fellow it seems did not think my Question worth an Answer, when I asked him whether sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">king wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld not serve all the Purposes of housing, which was inevitably attended with considerable Expence? He said nothing, but led me to his Hay-Rick, and taking out a Handful, desired me to ob|serve how the Outsides were damaged; how rotten, and consequently how weak and brittle, the weather-beaten Hay. Then ask'd me in his Turn if this were Flax, what kind of Cloth would you expect from it?&mdash;The A|nalogy undoubtedly will hold, and I own the Peasant's Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">soning so tho|rougly convinced me, that ever since I have look'd upon our Practice as a de|structive one, and accord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngly have endeavoured to explode it.</P>
<P>There is indeed a Difference between Hay and Flax; as the latter is much stronger, it does not rot entirely and go to Powder between your Fingers like the other: It will even stand the Dressing, notwithstanding the Injury it has received. But this aggravates the Evil, instead of alleviating it &mdash;If the Flax were so far damaged, as not to bear the Dressing, someth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng indeed would be lost in the Quantity, and considerably more in the Length, and consequently in the Value of it. But however, when that was over, the Manufacture could receive no Damage; whereas now it is spun into our Yarn and wove into our Cloths, which are therefore of unequal Strength in different Parts, and must break into Holes whenever the weaker rotten Threads meet with any Stress, either in the bleaching or the wearing.</P>
<P>I hope, Gentlemen, you will forgive me this Digression; I was led into it by the great Importance of the Subject. Housing is so necessary, and at the same Time so much neglected, that I cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d not wave this Opportunity of re|commending it a second Time to the serious Consideration of the Readers.&mdash; I shall now return to the immediate Business of this Letter, and proceed to the Directions to the Flax-dresser, how to water his Flax in the best Manner.</P>
<P>Our general Negligence, in an Article of so much Moment, makes it ne|cessary to recommend the Choice of proper Water in the first place.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER X.</HI> The Situation proper for a Flax-Dresser; with some further Con|siderations on the Watering of Flax.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS the natural Consequence of the Observations in my last, that a convenient Situation is nearly of the same Importance to the Flax-dresser, as it is universally allowed to be to the Bleacher. Our Dressers, if any there be among us who deserve the Name, do not seem to be aware of this, and while they undertake only small Quantities of Flax, and allow them|selves the indiscriminate Use of any Kind of Water, 'tis no wonder they should not. But whenever they enlarge their Business, grow nice and curi|ous in their Management, and commence Flax dressers in good earnest, they will find the Command of Water immediately requisite to their Success. 'Tis as material a Circumstance as any other, as even the Choice of proper Water, that there be a sufficient Supply at hand; otherwise the Charge of Carriage to and from a distant place must be laid upon the Dressing, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|hance the Price of it considerably.</P>
<P>Give me Leave to observe as I go on, that the Necessity of having settled Flax dressers resident in convenient Habitations, and disposed about the Country, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from this alone indisputably made out. Our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tinerant Underta|kers in this Kind must take the Water as they find it, good or bad, distant o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at hand, as the Place where they are employed affords it; and if there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a|ny

Weight in what I have offered in these Letters, let their Skill otherwise be what it will, this single Circ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mstance must defeat their best Endeavours.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be difficult readily to engage our People in a Method so widely different from their own:&mdash;But I would willingly persuade myself that it is however not impossible. Could I see but one good Flax dresser fix|ed in a proper Habitation, and provided with all Conveniencies at the pub|lic Charge, I should hardly entertain a Doubt of convincing the most obsti|nate. The Success which must infallibly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him would be an Argument to all Capacities alike, and give irresistable Encouragement to this Branch of the Linnen Manufacture. The proper End of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Encouragements is to re|move the Doubts and Fears which throw a Damp on every new Attempt, and to engage the Timerous to venture an Experiment. And surely nothing could answer that Purpose more effectually, than a standing Instance of Suc|cess always before their Eyes. It has been frequently proposed as a Scheme likely to succeed, to bring over Flax-dresse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to instruct and direct our Peo|ple:&mdash; But without they are disposed of in proper and convenient Settle|ments, I must think the Scheme deficient, and to speak out sincerely, of very little Use. The same Objections which now lie against our rambling Flax-dressers, will equally affect the other. They will do their Business as clum|sily when they are destitute of their Conveniencies; or should they exceed a li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tle in Dexterity and Neatness the Dresse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s among ourselves, yet a full and sufficient Instance of regular and masterly Flax-dressing they cannot possibly afford us. To the perfect Execution of this Art, there are so many Things required as can no where else be had but in a well-chosen Settlement; and to what Height it may be carried we shall never know, 'til we set about it in that Way.</P>
<P>I beg Leave to observe beside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and as an additional Argument to support what I hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> offered,&mdash;That without an Instance of the real Advantages of good and regular Flax dressing, our People will scarce be persuaded to at|tempt it.&mdash;Whereas, if a single Flax dresser had enriched himself by that one Business, thousands would immediately fall into it. Instructions and Di|rections can only then take place, when due Care has been bestowed, that some there should be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sirous to make use of them; and therefore the best Endeavours to inform our Peop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e will probably avail but little, 'til they have palpable experimental Proof, that it is their Advantage to be taught.</P>
<P>You may think this Hint a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ttle out of place, but if you consider it as I do, you'll easily forgive me. It will, methinks, should it ever be laid hold of, effectually promote Flax-dressing, and in the readiest Manner introduce that valuable Art, so greatly wanted and so little understood.</P>
<P>To return,&mdash;The most eligible Situation for the Flax-dresser is in the Neighbourhood of a large Lough, or a still River, and there in the most con|venient Spot for laying out his Ponds and Reservoirs. For however strange it may appear to us, who unhappily are used to a slovenly Negligence in this point, the Dresser, who would perfectly succeed, must have Ponds in every Situation. 'Tis true, large Basins of standing Water and slow Current are naturally good for Flax, and may be used with tolerable Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty; but they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> capable of Improvement, as no Current is certain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ter than a slow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and a small Pond less liable to Disturbance from Winds and Waves than
<PB N="22" REF="006127_0022_1027EFD1841E5DF8">
a large Lake. 'Tis probable our People will object, that it cannot possibly quit Cost, to provide against the accidental Inconveniencies of a sudden Storm, or the small Loss of Time which attends watering in a Current at so considerable an Expence.&mdash;But I beg Leave to refer them to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who by long Experience are convinced that the best Conveniencies are al|ways cheapest, and proceed accordingly in this and every other Case. I should not indeed despair assigning good Reasons for their Practice, if this were a proper Place to indulge philosophical Speculations. 'Tis certain, the longer the Water settles the softer it always proves, and the more kindly it ferments with the saponuceous Juice of Plants. And it might be easily made out, that the slowest Currents, and even standing Waters, exposed to the Ac|tion of the Wind, want some Assistance to make them as soft as could be wished. But as in the cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se of all these Letters I have built only upon Pre|cedents, I am willing to let this Point, as well as others, rest upon that Foun|dation.</P>
<P>To proceed,&mdash;As a Situation favourable in every Circumstance cannot always be obtained, the Flax dresser m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y sit down wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Safety in any place where there is Command of Water, and Room for Reservoirs, tho' the Wa|ter should not prove of the best and softest Kind; Springs excepted, which obstinately retain their Harsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ess. Any Stream sufficient to supply him may, with proper Care, be made serviceable to his Purpose. Admitting it into his Ponds betimes, and allowing it a longer Season to deposit gross, hard, and stony Particles, and receive the Influence of Sun and Air, will make indiffe|rent Water equal to the best. Where he has capacious Ponds, 'tis the Dres|ser's Fault if he has not good Water; and without entering into the Reasons of the Thing, 'tis indisputably certain from Experience, that Heat and Rest, which he may bestow upon it, by filling his Reservoirs early in the Summer, will take off all that Hardness which may hurt him.&mdash;Indeed differ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt Kinds of Water will require diffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent Times for settling, some more and o|thers less; but this will be soon determined, and demands no particular Di|rections. The main Point is to have Reservoirs sufficient for this Purpose. Whoever has them may always procure good Water, and without them no|thing but a scarce and lucky Situation can afford Success, and even that but imperfectly after all.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the several particulars mentioned in my former Letters I had invete|rate Prejudices, and the Weight of antient Custom against me. They were Directions to our People intirely new, and for that very Reason hard to inculcate: &mdash;That the Dresser should have a settled Habitation;&mdash;Avoid Bog holes and Rivers, the only Conveniencies almost we are acquainted with for wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ering;&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rovide himself with Ponds and Reservoirs, and stranger&punc; still, with st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nch and capacious Barns to house his undressed Flax:&mdash;I there|fore hope to be excused for enlarging on those Assertions. I was very sen|sible
<PB N="23" REF="006127_0023_1027EFD383EF8D98">
they would appear extraordinary to most among us, and require all the Assistance I could give them to make their Way against received Opinions. What I am at present to proceed upon is of a different Nature, and accord|ingly this Letter will consist of little more than plain Instructions, deliver'd in as plain a Manner.</P>
<P>When the Flax is laid in Water, it must be covered with a Weight to keep it down. Clay, Rushes, Fern, or Timber, answer this purpose equally;&mdash; and indeed any Thing will do tolerably well, sharp Stones excepted, which are apt to cut the Flax. However, if the <HI>Dutch</HI> are to be believed,&mdash;there is even in this a Choice: And tho' it seems in Speculation perfectly indiffe|rent what your Flax is cover'd with, Experience, they will tell you, has de|termined it is otherwise in Fact. They use the Slutoh or Mire at the Bot|tom of their Pond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, which is scarce any thing besides the Dirt of the Flax it|self, which in those standing Waters forms in Time a black and heavy Sedi|ment. This they imagine gives the Flax that light grey Tincture, which is perhaps less pleasing to an unskilful Eye, but takes the Bleach more kindly, and brightens better in the Cloth than the white or yellow Cast of ours. Whether they are right in their Opinion, a few Trials will inform us. Cer|tain it is that their Flax is of a different Hue, and takes a better Colour in the bleaching Green than the greater part of ours. And should this peculiar Kind of Slime contribute in any measure towards it, an additional Motive must arise from thence to use Ponds and Reservoirs, where alone it can be had.</P>
<P>'Tis impossible exactly to determine how long the Flax should lie in Wa|ter. The Fermentation necessary to free the Harle from the Bunn is over in a longer or a shorter Time, according to the Quality of both Flax and Wa|ter. Sometimes where the Water is exceeding soft, the Weather warm, and the Flax easy to be wrought upon, three or four Days will be sufficient. In different Circumstances the Fermentation lingers a Week, ten Days, and, as I am informed, in some Cases, sixteen or eighteen Days. There can be therefore no general Directions on this Head.&mdash;But the Dresser who knows his Flax and Water, and has made proper Observations on the different Ef|fects of different Weather, cannot be greatly at a Loss.</P>
<P>However, it will be an useful Precaution in the Dresser, to make repeated Trials of his Flax after it has lain three Days.&mdash;If the Bunn parts freely from the Harle, and the Flax dresses kindly after drying, it should be drawn imme|diately&punc; it has received all the Benefit of watering, and is impaired consider|ably every Hour it steep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, when that is over. I shall add, that it is not to be expected that Flax should have lost all Harshness when it comes directly from the Water:&mdash;The Dresser who waits for that, will have weak&punc; and half rotten Flax:&mdash;An Allowance must be made for Grassing, which takes off something of the Stubbornness the very best Flax retains, if it be not o|ver watered.&mdash;Our People have the more Occasion for an Admonition of this Kind, because among us it is a common Error to let Flax waste itself by Fermentation.&mdash;And we are so fond of Softness, that for it's Sake, in this and every other Article of Management, we give up Strength and Sound|ness, Qualities incomparably more valuable. The <HI>Dutch</HI> are on the contra|ry sollicitous in the first place for Strength, and will run every other Hazard
<PB N="24" REF="006127_0024_1027EFD60E8AF238">
sooner than that of weakening the Harle;&mdash;and indeed the Disparity i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|vious.&mdash;If your Harle is damaged, or, to speak more p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">operly, hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t|ten, there is no Remedy in After management.&mdash;Whereas, by the Help of longer Grassing, and afterwards of the softening Engines, too much Harsh|ness may in a great measure be removed. The skilful Dresser's B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">siness i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in|deed, to avoid both, and if he tries a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heaf of his Flax daily, as directed in the Beginning of this Paragraph, he cannot err consi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erably. But 'til by long Experience he is secured against Mistak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s 'tis his best Way however to lean to the safer Side, and draw his Flax too early rather than too late.</P>
<P>When <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Watering is over, Grassing follows immediately upon it. This is nothing more than spread<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng out the Flax upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry Ground covered with short Grass, there to he 'til it is dried, bleached, and softened suffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iently for Use.

Though Lands under short Grass are generally recommended by Flax d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s|sers, 'tis chiefly in Opposition to plough'd Grounds, where the Flax would be fullied and discoloured. Any dry Exposure free from Dirt may be used with Safety, and among those the warmest are the best</P>
<P>There are but few Directions to be given on this Head, the most material are,&mdash;that the Flax be turned f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">equently every second Day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">;&mdash; that due Care be h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of grassi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> beyond the proper Time, which is almost as pernicious as watering it too much, and that for the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">&mdash; and that when it is taken up it be reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">larly sorted, and the several Kinds separately tied up in sheaves.&mdash;The two first of these Particulars require <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o manner of Enlargement, since the Practice of turning Flax universally pre|vails, and every Body knows that the usual Time for grassing is from a Fort-night to three Weeks, according to the Wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her and the Goodness of the Flax.&mdash;On the third Particular a few Words may be necessary, because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing is but little understood among us.&mdash; I shall therefore conclude by obser|ving to your Readers, that when the <HI>Dutch</HI> tie up t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eir Flax, which they do in Sheaves as large as those of Corn, they take peculiar Care that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Flax in every Sheaf be of the same Length, Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eness, Strength and Softness. &mdash;By this Caution the several Staples are kept asunder and distinct, ready to be applied, each to it's proper Use, to the great Ease and Advantage of the Manufacturers, who, according to their different Wants, may be imme|diately supplied with every Kind.</P>

Drying; and notwithstanding the utmost Care in rippling, watering, and gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sing, an Error here may disappoint at last the Dresser's most valuable Hopes. 'Tis therefore a Matter of Surprize so little Thought has been be|stowed upon this Subject, that no Method of drying Flax will Safety has been introduced among us. The common Way of laying it on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and lig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting a Fire under them, is at first sight subject to so many Inconveniencies, that how it should at all be dreamed of, much more, how it should meet with so favourable a Reception a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to continue to this Day, the prevailing Practice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Country, is to me perfectly inconceivable.&mdash;That the Smoke, in it's passage through the Flax, must in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">allibly discolour it.&mdash;That several sheaves piled upon one another, and from the Situation of the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re placed at different Distances from it's Action, dry unequally.&mdash;That therefore of the same Parcel one sheaf must be almost burnt, and another not crisp enough for Use.&mdash;That in the self same sheaf a Heat, convey'd principally by Smoke, acts considerably slower on the Center than upon the external p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rts,&mdash;and by a necessary con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">equence, that these must be intirely parched before the other is even tolerable dry.&mdash;These methinks were o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vious Truths, and which it could have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">een no difficult Matter to foresee.

<P>Had the Reme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y been far removed from common Observation, it would be some Apology. But to overlook a Conveniency for drying, of daily Use in other Cases, and which alone could answer all the Dresser's purposes toge|ther, is unaccountable Negligence indeed; and I cannot help blushing for my Countrymen, that it should still be necessary to recommend an Oven to them.</P>
<P>The main Advantages of this Conveniency above all others present them|selves so read<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, that it would be needless to enlarge upon them. It dries cleanly, equally, and quickly, at a small Expence, and safely, and is liable to no Objection. But some Advantages there are, no ways inconsiderable, though of an infe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ior Kind, which it will be proper to take Notice of. These arise chiefly from the peculiar Manner of disposing the Oven and using it, and will be best explained in a particular Description of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Dres|ser's Mana<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ement.</P>
<P>I have observ'd in former Letters, that whoever undertakes Flax-dressing in that Country, provides himse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f with proper Housings. By that Name, be|sides his Barns and Granaries, you must understand a Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">king house, where he breaks his Flax and scu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ches it. The usual Dimensions of this place are in the clear thirty Feet by fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rteen, some<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hing la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ger where great Buss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ess is carried on, but seldom if ever less.

this I mention as the first of those Advantages, which may be obtained by a little Skill and good Oeconomy.</P>
<P>He secures a second, and more considerable one, by proportioning exactly the size and capacity of his Oven to the Dimensions of his Work-house. When the Flax is warm and crisp it works with greater Ease, and conse|quently at lower Rates; and in other Respects also to more Advantage. As it cools and gives, it again grows tough, requires more Stress and Time un|der the Break, cuts frequently by the Violence which then becomes necessary in the stroke, runs more to Tow of course, is charged with a higher Price for Labour, and is considerably worse. Hence the Dresser takes peculiar care to bring his Flax in full Crispness to break, and builds his oven so, that in one Day he may work off what it has dri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in the foregoing Night. By this means the Bunn is always b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ittle, flies off with few light strokes, and leaves the Harle sound and in perfect strength.</P>
<P>At their Rate of working, an Oven fif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">een Feet long, ten Feet wide, and five Feet high, will keep as many Hands employ'd one Day, as can be conve|niently disposed of in the Work-house abovemention'd. And I believe our People will imagine, that they have upon those Terms an heavy Task to go through. In our slovenly Way of doing Business, half the Quantity would be too much for twice the Hands. So great are the Advantages of Skill and proper Management.</P>
<P>It will be necessary to observe, that the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as an Improvement upon the former Caution, never draw two sheaves together. They take them sin|gly from the Oven as they want them, and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve them all the Benefit of what little Heat remains, as long as they can spare them from the Break.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to other Circumstances of their Practice, since I have gi|ven the Dimensions of the Oven, it will be proper to finish the Description of it. From the Size of it, it must be stronger than the Baker's, well roofed, thoroughly secured, and shut with a wooden Door. The Entrance may be in every Oven equal, &mdash;just large enough to admit a Man with tolerable Ease.</P>
<P>To return,&mdash;The next Thing the <HI>Dutch</HI> provide for is to save the Charge of firing. In the first heating of the Oven there is no Room for this, and proper Fuel must be had; but when once they have begun to break and scutch, the Dirt and Straws, which are beat out of the Flax in working, serve them ever after without any additional Expence; and each Parcel affords fi|ring for the next, in a regular Succession, 'til the whole is dried. These little Arts, and seemingly inconsiderab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Instances of good Oeconomy&punc; give the <HI>Dutch</HI> so much Advantage over u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that I must beg Leave to remind your Rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, that they deserve more of their Attention than perhaps they have hitherto bestowed upon them. In Business of this K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, where the Profits are necessarily small, Waste must be felt, be it ever so trifling in Appear|ance; and accumulated and continual Waste must infallibly end in Ruin, though each Particular, taken singly and asunder, is perhaps too minu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e for Observation.</P>
<P>Of this Kind, more especially than any other, is the Waste of Time and Labour. Three or four Minutes lost cannot well be charged in an Account, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch less the Misapplication of a little Strength; and yet multiply these Mi|nutes
<PB N="27" REF="006127_0027_1027EFDFD51BCF00">
into Hours, or increase the Waste of Spirits 'til it becomes Weariness, and the plain palpable Loss upon the whole will give sufficient Evidence how much was lost by Parcels.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> are aware of this more than any Nation under Heaven, and therefore lay out all their Art in saving Time and Labour. In the Case be|fore us they kindle Fire in the Oven early in the Evening,&mdash;some Hours be|fore the Work is over. The Sweepings of the Flax are soon thrown in and lighted, and the Oven heats and cools again sufficiently before the Breaks and Scutches are laid by. 'Tis ready to be fill'd, when the Business of that Day is ended, and when the next begins, 'tis again ready to be drawn;&mdash; not a Minute is lost in the whole Round, and the Work proceeds in a regular Succession no where interrupted.</P>
<P>I shall conclude by informing the Flax dresser, that his Oven is then of a proper Heat, when a Man can stand in it with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">siness. This is the Rule in <HI>Holland,</HI> and 'tis an Advantage peculiar to the Oven, that the Heat of it can be thus exactly measured. Kilns or Stoves cannot with equal Cer|tainty be tried; their Heat is variable and unsteady, and for that Reason dan|gerous and unfit for Flax. Which, to collect the whole Purport of this Let|ter into o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e general Assertion, can no where else be dried so perfectly as in an Oven.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XIII.</HI> General Observations on Breaking and Scutching of <HI>FLAX.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Observed in my Last Letter, that the Quantity of Flax which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Dress<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r breaks and scutches in a Day is, in proportion to the Number of Hands employed by him, considerably larger than that which we should here expect to have wrought off in the same Time.&mdash;That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his Difference in the Dispatch of Business ariseth chiefly from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ess of the Flax, when it is laid under the Break; and therefore will subsist no longer than 'til our Peo|ple are prevailed upon to dry as they do, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d use an Oven. The narrow Compass within which I am confin'd, to suit my Letters to the Dimensions of your Paper, allow'd of no Enlargement; and this Assertion, however it deserv'd it, I had not Room particularly to explain, much less to support by proper Arguments.</P>
<P>Give me Leave, therefore to resume them, and as it is of the greatest Im|portance to the Manufacture, to improve upon it, by shewing more minutely in what proportion the <HI>Dutch</HI> exceed us in Dispatch.</P>
<P>A Penny is the constant Price paid in <HI>Holland</HI> to the Undertaker, for break|ing and scutching F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ax by Wholesale;&mdash; something less therefore to the Journeyman:&mdash;And yet 'tis common in the latter to prefer Payment by the Pound, to the usual Wages of the Country Twenty pence a Day.&mdash; 'tis therefore evident that the Journeyman Flax dresser, among them, breaks and scutches singly above twenty Pounds of Flax.</P>
<P>Our People <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the contrary choose to receive their daily Wages, which seldom e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ceed nine Pence, never ten, rather than be paid according to the Quantity wrought off; tho' five Farthings is the lowest price given a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in <HI>Ireland</HI> by the Pound. Our Dresser therefore, upon the fairest Cal|culation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and scutches&punc; but eight Pounds of Flax a Day, and the Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n|tities of Work performed by the same Hands, in the same Time, are to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> another in the amazing Disproportion of two and a half to one.</P>
<P>The Facts are indisputable, and the Conclusion, how surprizing soever i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> may seem, fairly and regularly drawn. Three parts in five of the Strength and Labour of our Dressers are plainly m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sapplied, and for want of good con|veniencies to facili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate their Work, intirely wasted.</P>
<P>I believe I need not call upon the Readers to observe, that a Manufactur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rried on under such Pressures&mdash;Disadvantages is an Expression of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> weak a Meaning&mdash;can never flourish; 'tis rather a Wonder it should liv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and support itself, though faintly, against the Weight and Rivalship of a P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ople equally remarkable for Oeconomy and Indust<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y.&mdash;However to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> common Justice to the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gument, indulge me for a Moment longer, and give me leave to set it in another Light.</P>
<P>Our Labourer can afford to work for ten Pence, and, provided he receive daily that small Pittance, can maintain himself and Family with Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e.&mdash; The <HI>Hollander</HI> to the same purposes wants twice that Sum, and must there|for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> earn his two Pence&punc; for the other's Penny. At present he does more than all this:&mdash;Good Conveniencies, and superior Skill in the ready Use of them, enable him to underwork us considerably beyond that proportion.&mdash; But suppose our Dressers equally well provided, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve them the same Dexteri|ty.&mdash;and that a few Years Experience will b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stow,&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Tables immediately are turn'd. Our Flax must come cheaper from the Bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k and Scutche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by one half, and they instead of us be reduced to Streights and Shifts to support a decaying Manufacture.</P>
<P>Could our Journeymen hereafter, as theirs actually do, work off twenty Pounds of Flax a Day, they might afford their Labour for a Half penny per Poun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; three parts in five of the present Price would be taken off without prejudice to them, and by proportionable Improvement in other Branches of the Manufacture, our Cloths would come cheaper to the Market, than from any other Country under Heaven. According to the u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ual Computation&punc; that three Quarters of the current Price of Linnens is the purchase of Labour only, our Manufacturers, who live comfortably at home upon half the Wa|ges paid in <HI>Holland,</HI> can with equal Industry and Skill underwork the <HI>Dutch</HI> five and thirty Pounds in every hundred.&mdash;A Deduction which, whenever they are forced upon, 'tis impossible they should carry on their Trade.</P>
<P>I won't indeed pretend to vouch for the Exactness of that Computation.&mdash; 'Tis no easy Matter to strike a Medium upon the several Staples, and deter|mine what part of the whole Price should be charged on the Materia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s; and how much remains as the produce of mere Labour.&mdash;But certain I am, that in fine Cloths, the Estimate is considerably too low. The proportion between the Worth of the Materials in their native State, and the Value af|terwards, when manufactured and improved, is in Linnens of the finest Sta|ple, as ten, twenty, or perhaps more, to one; and ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fore there at least the Argument carries it's full Weight, and with a little Oeco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">omy and In|dustry, we may undersell the <HI>Dutch,</HI> a great deal more than thirty-five per Cent.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="006127_0029_1027EFE828571660">
To confirm this Assertion&punc;&mdash;which I hope may be of Use to encourage the Methods I propose for the future Management of Flax,&mdash;give me Leave to observe farther from my last,&mdash;That it is not only by misapplying the Strength and Labour of our People, that we suffer in the Articles before us; &mdash;but besides, and that considerably, by the Waste committed on the Flax, for want of thorough drying and a proper Crisp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ss. We are now obliged to use forcible and repeated Strokes in breaking, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o speak more properly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pound rath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r than break the Harle. This weakens and impairs it, and bes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">des deprives it of it's proper Length, one of the most valuable Qualities it has. In breaking, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce is applied cross-wise, and athwart the Grain; and therefore where it is too great, or too long continued, bruiseth and cuts the Fibres; which afterwards, in going through the Hackles, snap where they are weakest, and of course fall into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow. 'Tis impossible to ascertain this Damage, but at a Guess. I should imagine, that by this unhappy tho' necessary Effect of bad drying, we may hackle off from the same Flax one part in four more Tow, than the Dresser does in <HI>Holland.</HI>&mdash;If so, our Loss under this Head is considerably enhanced.&mdash;Or, to set the same As|sertion in a more comfortable Light, 'tis upon this Supposition in our Power, by a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">arge, to lower our present Prices, without any Diminution to the Owner's Profit, by increasing the Quantity of vendible good Flax, dress'd out of the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arcel.</P>
<P>I cannot leave any Thing with the Readers more likely to encourage them and therefore shall conclude by this general View of the whole Argument. &mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e waste by the present Misapplication of our Labour three parts in five of the Dresser's Industry.&mdash;We lose one part in ten nearly of our Flax.&mdash; And yet we stand our Ground, though with Difficulty, against the <HI>Dutch.</HI>&mdash; Suppose these Evils remedied, and what must be the Consequence&punc;&mdash;'Tis so plain a one, that it is almost Impertinence to draw it.&mdash;But it is at the same Time of so encouraging a Nature, that I cannot forbear inserting it at length. &mdash;The <HI>Dutch</HI> must be obliged to give up the Linnen-Trade,&mdash;which it will be impossible for them to carry on with any Profit, whenever we have learn'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow to husband our Advantages.</P>

<P>THE Instrument made use of to break Flax, is pretty much the same in this Country and in <HI>Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">land.</HI> However, as there is some Difference <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the Make, and more in the Manner of applying it, I though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it necessary to prefix a Draught of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Break <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Figure in the following Page.</NOTE> to the Directions in this Letter; because Words cannot convey so clean and distinct a Notion of Machines, as the Reader ought to have before him, when he is to be taught the Use of them.</P>
