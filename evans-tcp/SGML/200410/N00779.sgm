<HEAD>The Epistle Dedicatory. TO THE Churches of CHRIST IN New-England.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the Churches which are called <HI>Reformed,</HI> have attained unto but an <HI>Imperfect Refor|mation,</HI> is a Truth not to be denyed: The defect has not been so much in <HI>Doctrine</HI> as in <HI>Worship and Discipline.</HI> Nevertheless, in this respect some Churches have gone beyond oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs. In <HI>Geneva, France, Holland,</HI> they have made an higher Progress then in <HI>Germany:</HI> of which the chief <HI>Reformers,</HI> such as <HI>Melancthon, Martyr, Musculus, Zanchy</HI> and others were very sensible, bitterly complaining that many who were willing to cast off <HI>the yoke of Antichrist,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="000938_0004_0FAD923713729788">
yet were not willing to Subject to <HI>the Yoke of Christ.</HI> Amongst all the Reformed Churches, some have given the Preference to the <HI>Bohemi|an-Brethren,</HI> who sprang from the <HI>Waldenses,</HI> and they from the true Apostolick Church, not corrupted with Popery. These did <HI>Luther</HI> in the year 1524 mislike, because of their <HI>stri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Ecclesiastical Discipline.</HI> But twelve years after that, he saw cause to alter his Judgement, and write in Defence of those Holy Churches, which once he had written against, bewayling his own Error in that he had been so Lax in Admissions to the Lords Table, and wishing that the <HI>Evangelics</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> had began <HI>the Reformation</HI> with <HI>Discipline,</HI> and not with <HI>Doctrine</HI> only. For which change of his Judgement Popish Authors do unworthily upbraid him, since it was a change for the better. <HI>Lasitius</HI> (the Polish Histori|an) sayes, that if any where in the World <HI>the Primitive Apostolical Churches</HI> were to be seen, it was amongst the <HI>Ecclesiolae,</HI> the poor little Churches of the <HI>Bohemian Brethren.</HI> When Learned <HI>Bucer</HI> heard one of their Mi|nisters (who was sent on purpose into <HI>Germa|ny</HI> for that end) give an account of <HI>the Order of their Churches,</HI> he burst out into Tears, saying to the other Divines Present, <HI>This is Heaven upon Earth. Vergerius,</HI> (that famous Preacher who having been the <HI>Popes Legat</HI> to the Emperor, taking <HI>Calvins Instituti|ons</HI> into his hands with a design to confute him, was Converted thereby) wrote to an

Eminent Person in those Churches, that be Prayed for nothing in this world so much as that he might Live and Dye a member amongst them. Now that wherein these Churches did chiefly Excel, was their <HI>Order</HI> Especially in <HI>their great strictness as to Admis|sions to the Lords Supper.</HI> It was in those dayes objected against them, <HI>Fratres non habent Ecclessam apertam,</HI> that their <HI>Churches were enclosures,</HI> and their Church doors were too strai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. But they knew that the Scripture calls the Church a <HI>Garden Enclosed, a Spring shut up, and a fountain Sealed.

But by reason of an <HI>Vniversal Toleration,</HI> and through <HI>Corruption in their Schools,</HI> they

degenerated, and wonderfully lost their Disci|pline, until the Jealousy of the Lord dissipated and destroyed them all. A late writer ob|serves, that for the space of <HI>Forty years</HI> the <HI>Re|formed</HI> Churches in <HI>France</HI> kept close to their <HI>Ecclesiastical Discipline,</HI> but after that they grew remiss. And what has God done to them all at this day? It was spoken to the Church in <HI>Ephesus, Rev.</HI> 2 4, 5. <HI>Thou hast left thy first Love, Remember therefore whence thou art fallen, and do the first works, or else I will come to thee quickly, and will remove thy Candlestick out of his place.</HI> The <HI>Revelation</HI> was writ|ten <HI>Forty year<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> after the Church in <HI>Ephesus</HI> was first planted. The <HI>First Generation</HI> of Church Members in that time were doubtless the most of them dead: their Successors want|ed <HI>the First Zeal</HI> for the wayes of Christ wherein their Predecessors had Excelled. This at last issued in a Removal of the Candlestick.</P>
<P>And should not the dear Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> be awakened by such awful Examples to take heed l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ast it be thus with them? And therefore to beware of <HI>Declensions,</HI> either from <HI>the Fiath</HI> or from <HI>the Order</HI> of the Gospel.

Here God rewarded them with shewing to them <HI>the form of his House, with all the outgoings thereof, and all the comings in thereof.</HI> Mr <HI>Bright|man,</HI> before ever there was a <HI>New-England,</HI> Conjectured that there would be some Faith|ful Servants of Christ in a <HI>Wilderness,</HI> unto whom he should make <HI>Singular Discoveries</HI> of Truth; which several Judicious Authors have Esteemed as a Prophetical Passage fulfilled in what has come to pass in this <HI>American Desert.</HI> However, The Truths which respect <HI>Church Order</HI> are they which these Churches above any other are concerned to maintain: And an <HI>Apostacy</HI> from them would in <HI>New-England</HI> be a greater Sin and Provocation to Christ, then in any Place in the whole world. <HI>Regenvolscius</HI> in his <HI>Ecclesiastical History</HI> of the <HI>Slavonian Churches,</HI> relates that <HI>Lucas Brugen|sis,</HI> (a man famous for his Learning and Piety amonst the <HI>Bohemians,</HI>) was wont to say, that he did not so much dread all the Enemies and Persecutors whom they were continually endangered by, as he was <HI>afraid least remiss|ness in their Holy Discipline would prove the ruin of their Churches.</HI> His <HI>Prediction</HI> was sadly verified: I pray God the like fate may never attend these Churches, in too many of which there is an amazing <HI>Relaxation of Discipline.</HI> Sure I am, that <HI>to depart from the Order of the Gospel</HI> established in these Churches in

Some of them are great Blessings to the Churches, as inheriting the Principles, Spirit, and Grace of their Fathers and Grand-Fathers, but many of them do not so. On which ac|count, it is not at all to be wondred at, if they Dislike <HI>the Good Old way of the Churches</HI>; yea, if they Scoff at it, as some of them do; or if they are willing <HI>to depart from what is Ordinarily Practised in the Churches of Christ in New-England</HI>&punc; For <HI>the Congregational Church Discipline,</HI> is not Suited for a Wordly Interest, or for a <HI>Formal Generation</HI> of Profes|sors. It will stand or fall as <HI>Godliness in the Power of it</HI> does prevail or otherwise. That there is a great decay of the Power of Religion throughout all <HI>New-England</HI> is Lamentably true. If that revive, there will be no fear of <HI>Departing</HI> from the Holy Discipline of the Churches of Christ. But revived it will be amongst those who are Enemies to <HI>Explicit Covenanting</HI> with God and His People, against whom the <HI>Reli|gious Societies of the Church of England Commu|nion,</HI> now in <HI>London,</HI> will rise up and Con|demn them.

This being premised for the true stating of the <HI>Question</HI>; the An|swer is <HI>Affirmative.</HI> And that for these amongst other Reasons.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="14" REF="000938_0014_0FAD9243D2211D00">1&punc; There are Scripture predictions relating to the Times of the New-Testament which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that <HI>Evangelica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Churches</HI> shall consist of <HI>Holy Persons.</HI> It is foretold that the uncir|cumcised shall not Enter into Gods Holy City. <HI>Isai.</HI> 52.1.

That unsanctified persons shall be kept out of the Spiritual Jerusalem, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.27.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Scripture informs us that in Churches where the appointment of Christ was observed it has been thus. As in <HI>Ephe|sus, Corinth, Philippi, Colosse,</HI> the members of the Churches there, were <HI>Saints, Faithful Bre|thren, Sanctified in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A particular instituted Church is the House of God. That particular Church in <HI>Ephesus</HI> is said to be so. 1 <HI>Tim</HI> 3.15. A <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. Paul Bain on Eph.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 91.111.</NOTE> Learned and Eminent Divine has these Ex|pressions. As (saith he) a vertuous Civil man
<Q>do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not like to have in his House uncivil persons, so the most Holy God will not allow any to be in his Family, that are unholy. As no man can think well to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wine in his House, or Dogs and Swine to come to board with the rest of the Family, so open Sinners have no allowance from God to be in his Household.</Q></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="15" REF="000938_0015_0FAD92452E36EAD8">4.

The Ceremonial Holiness of the Jew|ish Church was <HI>Typical</HI> of that real Holiness which ought to be in Gospel Churches.</P>
<P N="5">5. When it has been otherwise, the Lord has reproved them that have caused or per|mitted such abuses; as in the Church at <HI>Co|rinth, Pergamus, Thyatira,</HI> which are blamed for their suffering Ungodly persons to be in their Communion. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5 2, 13. <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.14, 15, 20.

<HEAD>QUESTION II. WHether there ought not to be a Tryal of per|sons concerning their Qualifications and Fit|ness for Church Communion before they are Admit|ted thereunto?</HEAD>
<P>The Answer may be given in three Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r|tions.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="18" REF="000938_0018_0FAD92479736C790">1. We Affirm that Examination and Tryal of the persons who offer themselves to our S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d Communion whether they are duely qualified for it, is ordinarily necessary.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. If men professing and pretending to be Apostles were to be tryed whether they were so indeed or no, then there is the like reason that men pretending to be Saints, and so fit materials for Church Fellowship, should be tryed whether they be so or no. But the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ormer is plain from <HI>Rev</HI> 2.2. Where such persons were tryed and found to be but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the Old Testament there were per|sons set at the Gates of the Temple to see who they were that did Essay to enter, and to keep those out that were not duely qualified 2 <HI>Chron</HI>&punc; 23.19. And shall the New Testa|ment Temple, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Church of God, have no persons to Examine such as would enter thereinto? If Ceremonial uncleanness made men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to enter into the Material Temple, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Uncleanness renders them uncapable of Admission into the Spiritual Temple. Where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fore an Examination is necessary.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is said of the <HI>Mystical Jerusalem,</HI> that Twelve Angels were at her Gates, <HI>Rev</HI> 21.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Which does not obscurely intimate, that there are Officers in the Christian Churches whose work&punc; it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to observe who they are that Es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y to enter thereinto, that so the
<PB N="19" REF="000938_0019_0FAD92485EF5DB88">
worthy or duely qualified may be admitted and others be debarred from Enterance.</P>
<P N="2">2. The tryal to be used should be such as may make it appear to the Judgement of rational Charity, that the persons be so qua|lified as all Church-Members ought to be. It has been proved that <HI>Church Members</HI> ought to be <HI>Believers, Saints, Regenerate</HI> persons. And therefore the Church should put the per|sons, who desire Admission into their Holy Communion, to declare and show whether it be thus with them, whether they have truly Repented of their Sins, and whether they truly Believe on Christ. Thus we read that <HI>Philip</HI> Examined the Eunuch whether he did believe on Christ with all his Heart or no. <HI>Act.</HI> 8.37: And <HI>John Baptist</HI> put those whom he admitted to his Baptism to manifest their unfeigned Repentance. <HI>Matth.</HI> 3.2.</P>
<P>Nevertheless,</P>
<P N="3">3. A rigid Severity in Examination is to be avoided, and such tenderness and Charity ought to be used as that the weakest Christi|ans if Sincere may be encouraged and gladly admitted. Yea, it were better (as Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>In the way of the Churches p.</HI> 58.</NOTE> observes) to admit diverse Hypocrites then to keep out one Sincere Child of God from coming into the Church.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Our Lord Jesus Christ would not break the bruised Reed nor quench the Smoaking flax. <HI>Matth.</HI> 12.20. But gather the tender Lambs

<P N="2">2. Such as are weak in the Faith we are Expressly Commanded to receive. <HI>Rom.</HI> 14 1. Receiving into Church fellowship may well (amongst other things) be comprehended in that Expression.</P>
<P N="3">3. Weak Christians if Sincere have the Substance of that Faith and Sanctity which is necessarily required in Church Members; and therefore no reason they should be Ex|cluded, though others may Exceed them in measure and degree of Knowledge and Grace.</P>
<P N="4">4&punc; Church Communion and the Ordinances of God belonging thereto, being of special use for Confirmation and growth in Grace, such Christians that are the weakest have the most need thereof, and therefore by no means should be Excluded ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-from. These Rules being observed, we affirm that Examination of persons to be admitted into Communion at the Lords Table is necess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry. More Ar|guments for it may be seen in Mr. <HI>Cottons</HI> Ex|cellent Treatise of the <HI>Holiness of Church-Mem|bers.</HI> And in this Controversy those of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> perswasion agree with the <HI>Congre|gational,</HI> as we see in their <HI>Vindication of the Presbyterial Government</HI> published by the Mi|nisters at <HI>London</HI> in the year 1650. Where|in what we assert is largly proved by many Reasons, and the usual Objections against it, are solidly answered. In the primitive Times they were very strict in Examining those
<PB N="21" REF="000938_0021_0FAD9249E2E77C60">
who were admitted into Church Fellowship. The grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Chamier</HI> wisheth that the like strictness were used in these dayes. <HI>Origen</HI> against <HI>Celsus</HI> (Lib. 3. p. Mihi. 142, 147, 148.) sayes, that in those dayes, <HI>Christians did initiate none but Converted ones in their Mysteries, and that they did all that possibly they could do, that their Churches might consist of none but such as were endued with Spiritual Wisdom, and that therefore they that joyned to them submitted to severe Examinations.</HI> This principle, <HI>That ungodly persons are not fit to be admitted to the Lords Table,</HI> was asserted in the first dawnings of the <HI>Reformation.</HI> Not only such as fell in with the <HI>Geneva Discipline,</HI> but the <HI>First Reformers</HI> in the <HI>Church of Eng|land</HI> went thus far. The Twenty nineth Article sayes, <HI>That in the use of the Lords Sup|per, such as are void of a Lively Faith, to their Condemnation Eat and Drink the Sign and Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ.</HI> The <HI>Liturgy</HI> sayes, <HI>That in no wise men should come but in the Marriage Garment. That if any man be in Malice, or in any grievious Crime, Let him not come to the Holy Table, but let him Repent truely of his Sins past, and have a lively Faith in our Saviour Christ.</HI> Such Expressions as these are in the <HI>English Liturgy.</HI> A.

Christian man often to receive the Holy Com|munion: yet I do not recite all these things to the intent that I would in this Corrupt World where men live so ungodly as they do, that the old Canons should be restored again, which Command every man present to receive the Communion with the Priest; which Canons if they were now used, I fear that men would receive it unworthily.</HI> See the <HI>Appendix</HI> to <HI>Cranmers</HI> Life lately published by Mr. <HI>Strype p.</HI> 96.

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> There is some difference of Appre|hension, and yet no breach of Amity or <HI>Vnion,</HI> as to this <HI>Question</HI> between the Brethren of the Presbyterian and the Congregational way, the former giving this power only to the <HI>Eldership,</HI> the later joyning the <HI>Fraternity</HI> with them. <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>In Resp. ad Apollon. p.</HI> 13.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> and from him Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> has Judiciously stated and discussed this Controversy. Let their and some other Arguments be duely weighed in the Balla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of the Sanctuary.</P>
<P N="1">1. They that have power in Admission have power to Judge whether the persons to be Admitted are duely qualified for Admission. But this is true of the <HI>Fraternity</HI> as well as of the <HI>Presbytery.</HI> No one can be Admitted
<PB N="24" REF="000938_0024_0FAD924F6C70F7E8">
into the Church by the Elders without the Consent of the Brethren. The Commu|nity is concerned in who are Admitted, and therefore should concur therein. Its a receiv|ed maxim, <HI>Quod tangit omnes, debet ab om|nibus approbari.</HI> And reason sayes, They that have power to Admit have power to Judge whether the persons who desire it, are fit for that Admittance.</P>
<P N="2">2. They that have power to Judge whe|ther a person is fit to be cast out of Commu|nion, have power to Judge whether he is fit to be received into Communion. <HI>The Ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> [the power] <HI>of Opening and Shutting</HI> belongs to the same persons. But it is clear from the Scripture, that the Brethren and not the Elders only have power to Judge whether an Offender is fit to be Excommunicated. <HI>Matth.</HI> 18.17. 1 <HI>Cor&middot;</HI> 5.12. All Orthodox Divine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> agree that Church Discipline should be Ex|ercised, <HI>Consentiente plebe.</HI> So amongst the Ancients, <HI>Cyprian, Ambrose, Austin, Jerom, Chrysostom, Nazianzene, Theodoret, Theophylact.</HI> And amongst our Modren Divines, <HI>Calvin, Beza, Bullinger, Melancton, Junius, Pareus, Rivet, Trelcatius</HI> If their consent is necessary, than they have power to Judge whether they ought to consent or no.</P>
<P N="3">3 They that have power to Judge whether a person Excommunicated, is fit to be restored to the Communion of the Church, have power to Judge whether persons never yet received into the Communion of the Church are duely
<PB N="25" REF="000938_0025_0FAD92509424E7F8">
qualified for that Communion. But the A|postle writes to <HI>the Brethren</HI> as well as to <HI>the Elders</HI> of the Church in <HI>Corinth</HI> to restore a penitent, whom they had according to the discipline of Christ laid under a Church <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n|sure, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.6. If the Brethren are compe|tent Judges cencerning the Repentance of a Lapsed Communicant, they are not incom|petent Judges of the Repentance of other per|sons that may offer themselves to their Com|munion.</P>
<P N="4">4 When <HI>Saul</HI> desired to joyn to the Church at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> he was not admitted until the Brethren were by the <HI>Testimony</HI> of <HI>Barnabas,</HI> together with his own <HI>Declaration,</HI> satisfyed concerning the reality of his Faith and Re|pentance. <HI>Act</HI> 9 26, 27.</P>
<P N="5">5. If only Elders have power to Judge who are fit to come to the Sacrament or to joyn to the Churches, then in case there is but one Elder in a Church (as there are very few Churches in <HI>New-England</HI> that have more Elders than one) the Sole power will reside in that one mans hands. Then by a parity of reason one alone would have power to suspend from Communion, which Judicious Presbyterians do not allow of. For the <HI>Lon|don</HI> Ministers in their Vindication of the Pres|byterian Government, (<HI>p</HI> 70, 71.) have these words.
<Q>It is (say they) as warrantable by the word of God, for one Minister to assume unto himself alone the power of Suspending from the Sacrament, as it is to assume the

<HEAD>QUESTION. IV. WHether is it necessary that persons at their Admission into the Church, should make a publick Relation of the Time and Manner of their Conversion?</HEAD>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. As the <HI>Question</HI> is worded, the Answer must be <HI>Negative.</HI> Nor do the Churches of <HI>New England</HI> impose this<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: nor ought this to be required or desired of every one that joyns to our Communion:</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Some truly Converted ones know neither the Time nor the Manner of their Conver|sion&punc; It is often so with those that have been Advantaged with a Religious Education, and that have been all their dayes kept from fall|ing into Scandalous Sins. The Spirit of God changeth their Hearts gradually and insensibly, as Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> and other practical Divines have shewen. I have <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>In the preface to Mr.</HI> Mitchels <HI>Life.</HI></NOTE> else-where noted
<PB N="30" REF="000938_0030_0FAD9254524D16D0">
what Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> relates concerning a consi|derable number of Eminent Christians who being met together on other accounts, it was proposed whether they could all give an account of the Exact Time of their Con|version; and there was but one of them all that could do it.</P>
<P N="2">2. The natural Tempers and Infirmities of some are such as make them uncapable of relating publickly what God has done for them. Some have a natural Hesitancy of Speech. Others are of very bashful Tempers. Others are of such weak Intellectuals as that they can Scarce speak sence. To put such upon <HI>Publick Declarations</HI> of their Experiences, would be to expose Sacred things to be Contemned and Ridiculed by m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of profane Spirits.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is possible that the Occasion of a mans Conversion may have been something not fit to be publickly related. It may be the words of some persecuted Saint who is in obscurity. It may be some signal Judgment on some of his Relations: Nay, it may be some Secret Sin which himself has been guilty of, may have so wounded his Conscience as to occasion his true Repentance for all his other Sins: but this he ought not to tell the World of.</P>

satisfyed neither with the necessity nor yet with the Expediency of it. True it is, that the reason of that Opposition against it which is in the minds of some, proceeds from their own want of Experience. The <HI>American Apostle,</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> calls him) good old Mr. <HI>Eliot,</HI> who was very Zealous for publick Relations, has sometimes told us of a man that Joyned himself to the Church in <HI>Roxbury,</HI> who had been a very bitter Enemy to this Holy practice of the Churches in <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> until the Lord changed his Heart: And then when he offered himself to the Communion of the Church, he began his publick Relation after this manner. <HI>It may be it will be wondred at that I who have been such an Enemy to these Relations, and have so often inveighed against that practice of the Churches, should now be willing my self to Relate what impressions the Word and Spirit of God has made upon me. I must Confess, that when I was against that Practice, the true rea|son was because</HI> I had nothing to say; <HI>but it has pleased the Lord to Open my eyes, and to Change my heart: and now I am willing to De|clare unto all you that fear the Lord, what God has done for my Soul.</HI> After this manner did that Converted man Express himself. Yet nevertheless, some who have had Experience of the Regenerating Grace of God in their own Souls, have not thought it necessary, to declare this Publickly, when they Joyn in Church-fellowship. I remember my Worthy Friend
<PB N="32" REF="000938_0032_0FAD92591C840898">
and Ancient acquaintance, the Reverend and Learned Mr. <HI>John How</HI> (who was Pastor of a Congregational Church in great <HI>Torrington</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> where I was his Successor in the work of the Ministry forty years agoe) informed me of one in that Church, who had been very averse to make a Relation of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Experiences, as supposing there was no Rule in Scripture obliging all that joyned to the Church so to practice: But at last he yielded to the Importunity of them that desired it from him; and made such a Relation of the work of God on his Soul, that (as Mr. <HI>How</HI> assur|ed me) there was not one man in all the Church that had dry Eyes at the hearing of it. These things considered, we shall readily con|cede unto those who are Scrupulous about Relations, that <HI>A Formal Relation is not abso|lutely necessary</HI> in order to Admission into Church Fellowship&punc;</P>
<P>Nevertheless,</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 2. The practice of the Churches in <HI>New England</HI> as to this particular, is Lawful, Laudable, and Edifying.

<P N="1">1. There is Scripture warrant for this practice <HI>David</HI> sayes, <HI>I have not hid thy Righteousness within my heart, I have declared thy Faith|fulness and thy Salvation, I have not concealed thy

Psal</HI> 66.16. These Expressions show that a Christian should be willing upon just occasion, to declare the Goodness and Gracious workings of God upon his Soul, and this too in the Assembly and Congrega|tion of his People. Now if a Church does desire it, thats a just occasion for the doing of it: and therefore it then ought to be done. Moreover, the Scripture sayes, that Christians should be <HI>ready to give a reason of the hope that is in them to every one that asketh.</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.15. This Expression of <HI>A reason of their hope</HI> shews that they must not only de|clare what good things they hoped for in this or in another world, but also upon what grounds they did so hope. For else they might shew their hope, but not <HI>the Reason</HI> of their hope. Now if a man has Experi|enced a work of Saving Conversion, causing him to acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pt of Christ on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erms of the Gospel, he has sufficient Ground and <HI>Reason</HI> for Hope. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.18. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.1. But with|out that he has no reason to hope but the contrary. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.12.

it, surely they should be ready to do this before a Church of Christ who will not be offended with them, but bless God for what they shall hear. The Presbyterian <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vindication of Presbyterian Government. p.</HI> 67.</NOTE> Mi|nisters of <HI>London</HI> say well, whose words are these, <HI>If Christians are bound to give an account of their Faith and Hope to every one that asketh, yea even to Heathen Persecutors, how much more ought they to do it to the Officers of the Church? especially at such a Time when they desire to be admitted to such an Ordinance as is not common to all sorts of Christians</HI> I add, And how much more to a whole Church of Christ, if they ask it? There are also Scripture Examples to encourage this Holy practice. They who were admitted to <HI>Johns Baptism,</HI> made an <HI>Open Declaration</HI> of their Conversion. <HI>Math</HI> 3.6. And those Converts in <HI>Act.</HI> 2. did manifest that serious desires were wrought in their Souls to be delivered from their Sins, which lay upon their Con|sciences and pricked their hearts, and that they gladly received the word of promise. If this was publickly manifested by them be|fore their Admittance to Baptism; why should not the like be done now by Christians be|fore their Admission to the Lords Table? It is also recorded concerning the Converted <HI>Ephesians,</HI> that they not only believed, but <HI>Came and Confessed. Act.</HI> 19.18. which im|plyes <HI>A Publick Declaration of their Conversion</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="000938_0035_0FAD925CD092A148">
And we find that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> was ready upon all just occasions to relate the story of his Conversion. This does warrant Christi|ans now to practice the like on just occasions. And consequently when a Church of Christ shall call for it. The great <HI>Austin</HI> in his Book of Confessions, relates the story of his Conversion: The like we find in the pub|lished lives of many Saints. <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> in his disputation with <HI>Tryphon</HI> the Jew giv|eth a Marvellous account of his Conversion, by means of a Reverend old man, that ad|vised him to Read the Scriptures and to pray to God for illumination, and then departed out of his sight.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is necessary that Churches should know that those whom they admit to their Communion are duely qualified for that Com|munion. That they have in them (so far as men are able to judge) that which is the matter of Self-Examination, <HI>viz.

<HEAD>QUESTION. V. HAS the Church Covenant as Commonly practised in the Churches of New-England, any Scripture Foundation?</HEAD>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This <HI>Question</HI> was Considered at a General Convention of Ministers at <HI>Boston, May</HI> 26&punc; 1698. And all the Ministers then present (one only exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pted.) did Concur in the <HI>Affirmative.</HI> The Reasons to prove that this Practice of our Churches is not an humane Invention, but grounded on the Word of God, are such as these.</P>
<P N="1">1. Nothing is more Indisputable then that under the Old Testament, the Church was Constituted by a Covenant. Nor was any Proselyte admitted into that Church, but by laying hold of the Covenant. A Proselyte was <HI>Filius faederis</HI> a <HI>Son of the Covenant.</HI> The Jews were <HI>Vnchurched</HI> by being <HI>Discovenanted. Zech.</HI> 11 10. Things abundantly insisted on in the Old Testament, are more sparingly mentioned in the New. Such as the Sanctifi|cation of the Sabbath, and the Church State of the Infant Children of the Lords People. The like may be said as to the Church Cove|nant. Several Eminent Divines have given this reason why the Word <HI>Covenant</HI> is not men|tioned by the Apostles, when they speak of particular Churches. <HI>viz</HI> Because it is founded
<PB N="40" REF="000938_0040_0FAD9261D6E1B638">
on moral Equity, and often mentioned in the Old Testament. Moreover (as is noted by a Learned Author) the name <HI>Covenant</HI> and <HI>Covenanting,</HI> was that which would have made the Churches in those dayes Obnoxious to the Civil Powers, who were then Enemies to Christianity. Therefore the Apostles did for|bear the <HI>Names,</HI> but Established the <HI>Thing</HI> by Similitud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s evidently implying it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Scriptures which relate to Gospel Times, intimate such a Covenant as is used in our Churches. <HI>Isa.</HI> 62.5. 'Tis said of the Churches, <HI>Thy Sons shall Marry thee,</HI> which implies a Covenant. Thus <HI>Isa.</HI> 44.5 <HI>One shall say I am the Lords, and another shall Subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, and Surname himself by the name of Israel.</HI> This is Explicit Cove|nanting, to be in Gospel Times. So <HI>Isa.</HI> 56 4. <HI>They that chuse the things that please me, and take hold of my Covenant.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Members in particular Evangelical Churches are said to be <HI>Fellow Citizens. Eph.</HI> 2.19 Now there is no Admission into <HI>jus Civitatis,</HI> or City priviledges, but by an Act which implies a Cov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nant. Citizens are in a Covenant together to k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ep the Laws, and maintain the Liberty of the City.</P>
<P N="4">4. A Church when <HI>Collapsed,</HI> is restored by a <HI>Renovation</HI> of their Church <HI>Covenant</HI> with God, and with one another: Of which we have Instances in the Scripture. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 23.16. and 29.9, 10. and 34 31, 32. <HI>Ezra.</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="000938_0041_0FAD926391DE6AC8">
10.3, 5. <HI>Nehe.</HI> 10.29. Now there is the same reason of <HI>Restitution,</HI> as of <HI>Institution.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Nothing else can be mentioned as Con|stituting a Particular Church, but only a <HI>Covenant, Agreement,</HI> or <HI>Consent</HI> to walk with God and one another according to the Rules of the Gospel. Meer <HI>Cohabitation</HI> does not make a Church Member, for then Jews and Pagans would be Members of Evangelical Churches.

<P N="6">6 There are Scriptures in the New-Testa|ment which imply such a Covenant, as that which we plead for. <HI>Act</HI> 2.42. <HI>They Conti|nued,</HI> The Greek word signifies, <HI>They joyned and Cleaved together.</HI> So <HI>Act.</HI> 5.13.

let us suppose there are Forty Meetings in the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that in each Meet|ing half a Chapter is read every Lords-day, for three quarters of the year, by this Com|putation, there will be near Eight hundred Chapters read in these Meetings in a year.

the number of the Faithful, and that they might all be put in mind of what they had promised in Baptism. And although private Baptisms are ordinarily practised by the Mi|nisters of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> when no necessity compels them, the <HI>Liturgy</HI> allows not of it. The Arguments which our Divines produce against private Baptism are such as these.</P>
<P N="1">1. John Baptist did not Baptise in private, but where there was an open Publick meeting. It has been objected that <HI>Paul</HI> Baptised the Jaylor in a private House where was no Church Assembly: To which is Answered, that <HI>Paul</HI> was an extraordinary Officer: And that it was impossible in that Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that Time to call a Congregation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be witness<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the Administration when as yet there were no Christians in that City.</P>
<P N="2">2. Baptism is a part of publick Ministry: It ought to be as publick as Preaching. Nor may it be administred except by one who is called to the Publick Ministry.</P>
<P N="3">3. No person may be cast out of the Church privately, but the proceedings therein ought to be publick with the consent and presence of the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch Therefore the Seal of Admission into the Church by Baptism ought to be publick also. There is a parity of rea|son therein.</P>
<P N="4">4. Our profession of the Name of God and of Christ ought to be in the most publick way and manner that possibly can be <HI>Matth.</HI>

<P N="5">5. <HI>Didoclavius</HI> <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vbi supra p.</HI> 854.</NOTE> argues more like a Con|gregational man than like a Presbyterian. For thus he reasons. The power of Administring Sacraments is as <HI>Chrysostom</HI> speaks, <HI>Delivered to the Church,</HI> although the Dispensation or Administration thereof belongs to the Pastors. Now <HI>the Minister alone</HI> (sayes he) <HI>has not all the power, so as that he may separately Ad|minister the Sacrament to whom he pleaseth, but there ought to be the approbation, consent, and presence of the Church.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6 This practice of private Baptism was grounded on an Error; namely on a per|swasion of the absolute necessity of Baptism to Salvation. <HI>Austin</HI> was not without that Error. He thought that Infants who dyed Unbaptised could not go to Heaven, for which reason he has been called, <HI>Durus Pater Infantum.</HI> There was about the same time another Error worse than this crept into many Churches; <HI>viz.</HI> That none could be saved that did not partake of the Lords Supper. So did they misunderstand that Scripture <HI>Joh.</HI> 6 53. As i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sacramental Eating were there intended; whereas those words were spoken by our Sa|viour before the Lords Supper was instituted, and are meant of the Souls Eating and Drinking by Faith. But from this Error it
<PB N="67" REF="000938_0067_0FAD92830D176CD8">
was that Children were made to Eat and Drink of the Consecrated Bread and Wine. So lest they should miss of Salvation they would Baptism them in private when it could not be done in publick. But we know that it is the <HI>Contempt,</HI> and not the meer <HI>Privation</HI> of Sacraments that is damning. The <HI>Helvetian</HI> Churches do in no case allow of Baptism in any private House.

<HEAD>QUESTION. IX. OVght all that Contribute towards the Main|tainance to have the Priviledge of Voting in the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ection of a Pastor?</HEAD>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It would be <HI>Simoniacal</HI> to Affirm that this Sacred Priviledge may be Purcha|sed with Money, or, that <HI>Contribution</HI> can Entitle to it. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. This is against the Scripture, and that in more respects than one.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Scripture requires all that are taught to Contribute to him that is their Teacher. <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.6. But it does not say that all who are taught shall have power to chuse a Pastor for that Church where they are taught. In the Primitives Times the <HI>Catechu|mens</HI> did many of them Contribute to him that was their Instructor, but not one of
<PB N="68" REF="000938_0068_0FAD9283B2016FF8">
them all had the priviledge of Voting in the Election of the Churches Pastor.</P>
<P N="2">2. The word of God has given power to the Brethren in particular Churches to chuse their own Officers. <HI>Act.</HI> 1.26. &amp; 6.2, 3, 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. &amp; 14 23. Wherefore to give it to others be|sides them is not according to the word of Christ.</P>
<P N="3">3. If all that Contribute have power to Vote in the Election of a Pastor, then many women must have that Priviledge, for they may Contribute to the Maintainance. But this the Apostle allows not of. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.34, 35. So that this Affirmation is Contrary to the Scripture in more respects then one</P>
<P N="2">2. It is against Reason. For them who have no right to the Lords Supper themselves&punc; to appoint who shall be the dispenser of that Ordinance to others, is highly irrational.</P>
<P N="3">3 This will deprive particular Churches of that Power which does belong to them, and which Christ ha's purchased for them wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the price of his own Blood. To have power to Chuse their own Pastors is an invaluable Pri|viledge For them to give or rather to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll that Priviledge away to all that will <HI>Contribute,</HI> must needs be displeasing to the Lord who has bought it for them at so dear a rate.

for him. So then this Principle is of Dan|gerous Consequence. It may soon prove fatal and destructive to the Churches, and to the Interest of Christ amongst them.</P>
<P N="4">4 It is contrary to the principles and practi|ses of Christians in the Primitive Times&punc; <HI>Eusebius</HI> sayes that after the Death of <HI>James,</HI> the Church chose <HI>Simeon</HI> the Son of <HI>Cleophas</HI> to be his Successor. Nothing is more Evident then that in the First ages of the Church, Pastors were Chosen by all and only their Flocks; in Chusing a Minister they did <HI>Klero|zein,</HI> that is Chuse him by Lot; from whence it was that Ministers had the name of the <HI>Clergy</HI> given to them. <HI>Ignatius</HI> writing to the Church in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> tells them, that it be|longed to them to Chuse their Pastor. The <HI>Nicene Council</HI> in a <HI>Synodal Letter</HI> to the Churches in <HI>Africa,</HI> advise them to Chuse Orthodox Pastors instead of <HI>Arians.

<P N="1">1. The Essence of a Ministers Call consists in a mutual Election between him and his People.

The <HI>Coronation</HI> of a King is not Essential to his Of|fice, nor is the Solemn <HI>Inauguration</HI> of a Publick Magistrate Essential to his being a Magistrate. No more is <HI>Ordination</HI> to the being of a Mi|nister. Learned Papists notwithstanding they are wont to place the Essence of a Ministers Call in his Ordination, says that a <HI>Cardinal</HI> has his Ecclesiastical power by vertue of his <HI>Election</HI> before his <HI>Installment.</HI> And that a <HI>Pope</HI> when Elected has Power to rule the Church before his <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thronization.</HI> The Lawyers say that <HI>Solennia non sunt de rei Substantia.</HI> We cannot say that if a man has not received Imposition of hands that then he is no Pastor, but we may say that if he has not been Elected by some Church of Christ he is no Pastor, but his Ordination is a nullity.

<P N="4">4. There are few of those who use the <HI>Lords Prayer,</HI> that keep to the words either of <HI>Matthew</HI> or of <HI>Luke</HI> in their saying of it.

The words in <HI>Luke</HI> are, <HI>Forgive us our Sins, for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us,</HI> Luk. 11.4. When as they that say

the Lords Prayer use the words which are in the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> viz <HI>Forgive us our Trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us.</HI> It will be said, that is the same <HI>thing</HI> though not the same <HI>words</HI> with the other. But this is to give up the cause, since our Question is not concerning <HI>things</HI> but <HI>words.</HI> Moreover, by this small alteration of the words a Great Truth, viz. <HI>That our Sins are our Debts,</HI> is lost. <HI>Cyprian</HI> is justly blamed for making a little change in the <HI>Sixth Petition,</HI> for he expresseth it, <HI>Ne pa|tiaris nos induci &amp;c Suffer us not to be led into Temptation,</HI> whereby a great and myste|rious Truth respecting the Activity of Pro|vidence in Leading men into Temptation is obscured. They that pretend they are bound in Conscience to use the <HI>Lords Prayer</HI> as a <HI>Form,</HI> and so to keep exactly to the words therein contained, are not able to Extricate themselves from this Argument against them.

was practised in the Assemblies of Christians in those days, <HI>viz.</HI> of their Reading the Scriptures, Preaching thereon, Prayers, Administration of Baptism and the Lords Supper, but has not the least hint of their using to repeat the Lords Prayer, which had it then been Customary, no doubt he would have mentioned it as he does some other things which were deviations from the Apostolical practice, particularly that of sending the <HI>Eucharist</HI> to such as were absent. It is true, that in the <HI>third Century,</HI> the Lords prayer was used in some of the Assemblies of Christians, yet not in all of them, only when the <HI>Communicants</HI> were by themselves alone: They never repeated that prayer if any that were only <HI>Catechumens</HI> hapned to be present.

It
<PB N="126" REF="000938_0126_0FAD971A0B6A2E20">
is evident that <HI>Origen</HI> did sometimes use this prayer; but without an opinion of its being necessary. For when he writes concerning a method of prayer, he adviseth to begin and end with <HI>Doxologies:</HI> but he does not advise to begin or to end with the Lords prayer. <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> concludes his last Book of <HI>Pedagogy</HI> with prayer, yet not with the <HI>Lords Prayer.</HI> This enervates what Mr. <HI>Ri|chard Ward</HI> and other object, <HI>viz.</HI> That if the Lords prayer, was given only to be a rule, and not enjoyned as a form, then Chri|stians for 1500 years together did not un|derstand the true meaning of <HI>Mat.</HI> 6 9.
