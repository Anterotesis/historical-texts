intimate which is the scope of the Words which have been now read: wherein we have two things: 1. A Criminal. 2. The Punishment to be inflicted on such a Cri|minal.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Criminal <HI>He is a Murderer</HI>: there are three Particulars mentioned, which if they concur the person is guilty of Murder: 1. If he smites another man, <HI>h. e.</HI> if he does so, not accidentally but designedly. 2. If the <HI>Instrument</HI> which he smites him with be of <HI>Iron,</HI> that makes the Murder to be the more evident. In the verses following it is added, <HI>That if he smite him mortally with a Stone, or with Wood, he shall be accounted a Mur|derer.</HI> The <HI>Jewish</HI> Writers tell us, <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Grotium</HI> &amp; <HI>Ainsworth</HI> in Locum.</NOTE> That if a Man were slain, there was diligent en|quiry made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ncerning the <HI>Instrument,</HI> where|by he was killed. If it was with a Stone, or with Wood, they examined whether the Stone or Wood were of that bigness as that the dead man might probably receive his deaths Wound thereby: But (they say) if it were with an <HI>Instrument of Iron</HI>; no enquiry was made as to the greatness of it, because the least nail of Iron might easily kill. And it is to be presumed, that a man will not strike ano|ther with an <HI>Instrument of Iron,</HI> except Blood

and Murder be in his Heart. 3. If the Wound prove mortal, then the striker is guil|ty of Murder. Though a Man should smite another, and that with an Instrument of iron, if death does not follow, he is not guilty of that high degree of Murder which the Text speaks of; but if he smite his Neigh|bour so that he die, then he is a Murderer.</P>
<P N="2">2. Here is the punishment to be inflicted on such a <HI>Criminal. The Murderer shall surely be put to death.</HI> Only Gods Order was to be observed. The Murderer was to be put to death in a judiciary way. Amongst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>Jews, the avenger of blood was to be the Execu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">,</HI> as the nineteenth verse in this Chapter shews, where it is said, <HI>that the avenger of blood him|self shall slay the Murderer.</HI> The Hebrew Word for the <HI>Avenger of Blood</HI> is <HI>GOEL,</HI> which is sometimes transla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d a <HI>Red<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mer.</HI> The Word properly signifies one that is <HI>near a kin.</HI> The next kinsman had right to Re|deem, he also was to be the Avenger of blood. Only before Execution could be done, the Magistrate was to pass a Judgment. The Man-slayer was sent from the City of Refuge whither he fled, unto the place where the Fact was done, there to have his Trial. If the Magistrates of that place found him not Guilty, he was returned to the City of Re|fuge

there to be in safety till the death of the High Priest, and then to be set at liberty: But if he was found guilty of Murder, he was to be put to death publickly by the hand of Justice.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine</HI> then before us, or suited to the present Occasion is, That Murder is a Sin so great and hainous as that whoever shall be found Guilty of it, must be put to Death by the hand of Publick Justice.</P>
<P>The Explication and Confirmation of this Doctrine may be set before us in three <HI>Propositions.</HI></P>
<P>Propos. I. <HI>Murder, is wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n a Man does voluntarily and unjustly take away the life of another person.</HI></P>
<P>So that there are three things implied in Murder:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Object slain must be one of man-kind.</HI> To take away the life of another Creature is n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Murder. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e eighth Commandment

saith, <HI>Ye shall not Kill.</HI> The Hebrew words are LO TIRTZACH, <HI>i. e. Thou shalt not Murder.</HI> It was vain opinion of the <HI>Ma|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bees</HI>&punc; when <HI>Austin</HI> confutes, That the Life of no Creature might be taken away, because the Commandment of God saith, <HI>Thou shalt not kill.</HI> God has given express leave to all the Sons of <HI>Noah, i. e.</HI> to Mankind, that they should take away the Lives of other Creatures, as they should see cause; only Man being a more Divine Creature, his Life is to be Sacred. It may not be medled with, except in cases where the Great and Soveraign God, who has an absolute Power of Life and Death, has appointed.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Capital Murder is wilful.</HI> There is a difference between Murder, and <HI>Casual Ho|micide,</HI> or Accidental Man slaughter. If a Man shoots an Arrow, or throws a Stone, or the like, not thinking that any one will be hurt thereby; in case it should happen to kill a man, it is not Murder. If that he did it ignorantly, unawares, and no way <HI>sought the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arm</HI> of the slain Man, he is not to be punished as a Murderer: This we see in the Context. <HI>ver.</HI> 15, 23, 24, 25.

But especially Spiritual Vengeance follows this Sin: The Murderers Soul is filled with hellish horror of heart; so that he is as it were Damned above ground, and in Hell whilst he is yet alive. <HI>The A|venger of Blood pursueth his Soul</HI>; Murderers have confessed, that as soon as ever they had committed the Bloody Fact, they felt the Flames of Hell-fire in their Consciences, and this we see in <HI>Cain.</HI> Therefore after he had murdered his B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">other, he cried and roared out, that his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in was greater than could be for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, his punishment greater than could be endured. And some think that the mark which the <HI>Lord</HI> set upon <HI>Cain,</HI> was a ghostly, guilty Countenance, that he had Hell and Horror in his Countenance as well as in his Conscience. And without Repentance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lasting Vengeance will follow that Sin.

<HI>John</HI> 3.15. that is, without true Repentance: And if he has not Eternal Life, then I am sure he has Eternal Death and Damnation. If the Murderer were only to have the Life of his Body taken from him, tho in a pain|ful, shameful and accursed way, that were a light matter; but there is an eternal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; a weight of everlasting vengeance, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ier than Mountains of Lead, that shall press his immortal Soul to death, world without end, Murder then is a fearful Sin.</P>
<P>Propos. 3. <HI>The Murderer is to be put to death by the hand of Publick Justice.</HI> And this con|firms the former Proposition concerning the greatness of this Sin: Men may not pardon or remit the punishment of that Sin. Among the <HI>Jews</HI> there was no City of Refuge for a wicked or wilful <HI>Man slayer</HI>; and it is said in the one and thirtieth verse of this Chapter, <HI>You shall take no satisfaction for the Life of a Murderer, which is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to Death.</HI> This Sin shall not be satisfied for, with any other punishment, but the death of the Murderer: There are some Crimes, that other punishment less then death may be accepted of as a Compensation for the wrong done; either some mulct or Fine in their Estates, or some other corporal punishment
<PB N="14" REF="000417_0017_0FA5B4F958B7D1E0">
less than death, but in case of Murder, no Fine or Imprisonment, or Banishment or Corporal Punishment less than death can be accepted: <HI>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u shall take no satisfaction for the Life of a Murderer.</HI> And indeed equity re|quires this; by the Law of Retaliation, it is m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> that men should be done unto, as they have done to others; and that as Limb <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ould go for Limb, so Life for Life. But besides that, there are two Reasons mentioned in the Scripture, why the Mur|derer must be put to death.</P>
<P>Reas. I. <HI>That so the Land where the Mur|der is committed, may be purged from the guilt of Blood.</HI> For Murder is such a Crime as does pollute the very Land where it is done; not only the person that has shed blood is polluted thereby, but the whole Land lieth under pollution until such time as Justice is done upon the <HI>Murderer</HI>; thus in the thirty third verse of this Chapter; this is given as the reason why no satis|faction might be taken for the Life of a Murderer, <HI>so shall ye not pollute the Land wherein you are; for blood it defileth the Land, and the Land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed, therein but by the blood of him that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it.</HI> One Murder unpunished ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing guilt and a Curse upon the whole land&punc; that all the Inhabitants of that Land shall suffer for it; so that mercy to a Murderer is cruelty to a people. Therefore is it said concerning the Murderer, <HI>Thin: Eye shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e pity him, but thou shalt put away the giult <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cent Blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.</HI> If the Murderer be not punished, it may go ill with the whole, all may fare the worse for it; if the sin be not duly punished there is a partaking in the guilt of it.</P>
<P>Reas. II. <HI>Because Man is made in the image of God.</HI> This Reason is mentioned Gen. 9.6. <HI>Whosoever sheddeth mans b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ood, by man&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.c.</HI> by some man in Authority, proceeding in an orderly way of Judicature, as the Hebrew Expositors do rightly interpret the words, <HI>shall his blood be shed, for in the image of God made be him.</HI> Hence there is sacrili|gious guilt in this sin; Amongst the <HI>Romans</HI><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sucton.</HI> in tiber. cap. 58.</NOTE> if a man did but strike his Servant near the place where one of their Empe|rors lay, he was to die for it, because that was looked upon as an affront put upon his <HI>Imperial Majesty</HI>; so he that shall kill a man that is made after the image of God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

they have something like Grace; a shadow of it, they hate flagitious Crimes, and approve of a morally honest Conversati|on; these things shew that there are some remainders of the Image of God in men: Therefore he that shall murder such a Crea|ture is worthy of death.</P>
<P>But thus for the Doctrinal handling of the Truth before us: I proceed to make some Application.</P>
<P>1. By way of Information.</P>
<P>2. For Exhortation.</P>
<P>Infor. 1. <HI>This Doctrine justifieth the Au|thority here, in respect of the Sentence of death which has been passed on the Murderer, who is this day to be executed.</HI></P>
<P>There is a man standing before the Lord, and amongst his people this day, who has done just as my Text expresseth, He has smitten his Neighbour, and that <HI>with an In|strument of Iron too,</HI> with a cruel Spit made of Iron; the thing proved by several Witnesses,
<PB N="18" REF="000417_0021_0FA5B4FBE76B04C8">
and the man that was hurt dyed by that wound; therefore he that has smitten him is a Murderer, and must surely be put to death; though for a long time he denied it, nevertheless since his Condemnation he has acknowledged it, and yesterday he confessed to me, that he had in his rage murdered the man, whose death and blood has been laid to his charge; he told me that the other gave him some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll language whereby he was provoked, and that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> said to him, if he came within the door, he would run the Spit into his bowels, and he was as wicked as he said he would be, so that he is guilty of Murder. Therefore none ought to blame those in Au|thority for causing the Murderer to be put to death; conscience to God, and to the people under their charge, and to their own Souls also, has necessitated them to do what they have done in this matter. Let every one re|member that Scripture, Prov. 28.17. <HI>A man that doth violence to the blood of any person, shall flee to the Pit, let no man stay him</HI>; if he has shed blood, to the Pit let him go, and flie thi|ther, let all convenient speed be used in the execution of Justice, that so the Land may be cleared from blood, and let no man in Authority stay him, let no private person So|licit for him. But let us be thankful to God,

<P><HI>I</HI> James Morgan, <HI>being Condemned to die, must needs own to the glory of God, that he is Righteous, and that I have by my Sins provoked him to destroy me before my time.

And then what Wo and Sorrow followeth: Oh how many have by means of this Sin, been guilty of <HI>In|terpretative Murder!</HI> They have caused others to die by making them drunk; There has been an horrible thing done in this place; some wicked persons (who they are God knows) have given or sold Strong Liquors on

They that are poor and wicked too (Ah most miserable Crea|tures!) can for a peny or two pence make themselves drunk: I wish to the Lord, some Remedy might be thought of, for the preven|tion of this evil. It is a very sad thing, that
<PB N="31" REF="000417_0034_0FA5B5096C76F328">
so many Bodies and Souls should be eternally ruined, and no help for it. How few are there, that if once they be addicted to this vice, do ever truly repent of it, or turn from it. There was a man, who hearing that his Son took evil courses, and that he followed such a vice, well (said he) I hope he'll leave that; and that he was given to another vice, I hope (said he) he'll leave that too; but it was told him his Son was given to Drunken|ness also: Nay, then (said he) <HI>I have no hope of him.</HI> I will not say (as he did) there is no hope that ever a Drunkard should repent, but I say, there have been but few such instances in the world. How rarely have any of you known a man that has been addicted to this Body destroying, and Soul-murdering iniqui|ty, that has truly repented of it, or turned from it again. O then, let men that have any love for their Lives or Souls, beware of this bloody Sin.</P>
<P>But the other evil which this undone man, does especially cry out of, and which now that he seeth his Soul going into Eternity, he saith, <HI>lieth most heavy upon his Conscience,</HI> is <HI>his despising the Word of God.</HI> I do not won|der to hear him speak so, for I have known several Condemned Persons, who have made the same out-cry. <HI>O nothing terrifieth our Con|sciences,

Verily I say unto you, all the sins in the world will not Damn like this: Suppose a man to have been guilty of Adultery, or Murder, or the most horrid Transgressions against the Law of God, these will not Damn his Soul like that of despising the Word of God. <HI>For this is</HI> the <HI>Condemnation that light is come into the world, and men love darkness rather than light.

And this is true, not only concerning such as have lived under the constant preaching of the Gospel, and yet remain, and live and dye in a natural un|converted estate; but of them also, that might hear the Word of God, but will not;

This dying man, now that his Conscience is awa|kened, saith, it is a terror to him to think, <HI>I might have heard the Word of God Preached many a time, but refused it</HI>; he neglected to hear Sermons, not only on Lecture-dayes, but on Lords-days too; when he was a Ser|vant, he was wont (as himself saith) on the Sabbath days, to go out into the Fields, and there to profane the Lords day, at the very time when he might, and ought to have been hearing the Word of God; and since he had a Family, his custom was to keep at home, when others were attending the Publick Worship of God; and he told me, that he did foolishly please himself, and think he had a sufficient reason to stay at home, because he had not Cloaths good enough to appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r pub|lickly in; when as the mony that he mis|spent in drink, would have procured him cloathing. Let others then by his example, be warned against this evil, lest they pro|voke God, and feel sorrow for it, as he has done. I doubt there are very many in this great Town guilty of his Sin in this particu|lar, perhaps some that are Professors of Reli|gion, which is dreadful to think on. I hear

some say, that there are many hundreds, nay, some thousands in this place, that seldome hear a Sermon Preached, from one end of the year to the other; if that be so, it is ve|ry lamentable. What is like to become of the Souls of such profane persons? If they that are in place of Power (be they Superior, or inferior Officers) can possibly redress this evil, they will certainly do a Service accepta|ble to God, and to the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>But I proceed to the second <HI>Exhortation.</HI></P>
<P>If Murder be such a Crime as has been de|clared, then, <HI>let whoever has been guilty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">'s sin, be humbled for it, and repent of it.</HI> As for <HI>Interpretative Murder,</HI> many are guilty of that.

But I hope there is none in this vast Assembly, that has been guilty of that Murder which is by the Law of God, and of the Land a Capital Crime, excepting one man, and one such person where is here present, unto whom I shall now particularly apply my self.
