<P>THe Subject of this following Discourse, now offering it self to thy Perusal is one of the many <GAP DESC="foreign"> which it hath pleased the Al|mighty Lord of Heaven and of Earth, to treat of and insist upon, in Drawing up and Publishing to the World the great and glorious volume of his Works: in the Margent whereof they have been frequently placed as Red Letters, Asterisms, or pointing Hands, to awaken unto a more heedful attention and serious consideration, the dead heart|ed sleeping and secure World of Mankind. To promote this, the best and most blessed end and use, of such tremendous and threatning Aspects of the highest and most Dreadful Majesty, is the pious design of the Reverend and Learned Author, in compiling &amp; publishing this Treatise, &amp; its a thou|sand pities it should not be attended to and attained by a People so circumstanced as we, English trans|planted into, or procreated in these <HI>American De|sarts,</HI> be. The labour and pains it hath cost the Au|thor to peruse and consult so many Writers, ancient &amp; modern, <HI>Astronomers, Chronologers&punc;</HI> &amp; Hi|storians,
<PB REF="000352_0003_0FA4AD94B7BCA188">
is such as will render it very disingenious, not to give it a graceful and friendly reception and entertainment. He hath therein presented thee with, <HI>first,</HI> the <HI>Theory; secondly,</HI> the <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Comets,</HI> commonly called <HI>Blazing Stars.</HI> As to the <HI>Theory,</HI> there is (to my understanding) as much declared, as it hath pleased the Father of Lights and Fountain of all knowledge &amp; wisdome (hitherto) to discover to poor ignorant Mortals; <HI>viz.</HI> the result of the judicious thoughts of the ablest and best accomplished <HI>Artists,</HI> who upon very ma|ny accurate, unquestionably true and exact Ob|servations, made by the help of choicest Instru|ments improved by minds intensely set to search into, and find out the Mystery and Meaning of those abstruse and admirable works of him who is most High; have declared what they conceive most rationally probable. The wisest of Men know that they understand but little part of Gods wayes and works; and are not ashamed to confess that in so much things above humane Capacity, they are ra|ther <HI>Quaerists</HI> then <HI>Adeptists,</HI> content to be igno|rant of what he is pleased as yet not to discover; our <HI>Authors</HI> modest expressing himself, sheweth he wrote under the influence of so humbling a conside|ration.</P>
<P><PB REF="000352_0004_0FA4AD96369BDFA8">Of the second, or <HI>Historical</HI> part of the Dis|course, the scope is, to evidence and evince that <HI>Comets</HI> are ordinarily the forerunners of disaste|rous Calamities, Mischiefs, &amp; Miseries, hastning to follow and fall down on the heads of senseless &amp; secure Sinners. For the clearing up and making out of which, by way of induction, a great multi|tude of particular Instances and Examples are out of sundry <HI>Authors</HI> of approved ability and faithfulness alledged; who have left upon Record their accurate observations of time, place, and o|ther circumstances of several <HI>Comets</HI> in divers ages, with the dreadful Revolutions, dismal Com|motions and Confusions which followed them at the heels. If it be said, that some of those <HI>Peri|wigged Heraulds</HI> have appeared on the <HI>aethereal stage</HI> upon a more benign account: it may be ra|tionally replied, that the number of such is very small: and that their <HI>blasting influences,</HI> might be direfully operative in remoter and less known parts of the Earth.

<P>SOme Worthy Persons having desired me to Write the History of Comets; I resolved (with Divine Permission and Assistance) to spend the spare hours of a few Weeks in an endeavour that way. And accordingly I have pe|rused what Books I could meet with, which might be helpful to me in this undertaking. There is a late Author <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Stanislai, de <HI>Lubienietae</HI> See <HI>the Philosophi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; Transactions for</HI> An. 1668. vol. 3. p 691., 1071,</NOTE> who on occasion of the Comets seen <HI>Annis</HI> 1664, 65 hath published a large Volume, which he calls <HI>Theatrum Cometicum,</HI> wherein he giveth an account of all the Comets which have been obser|ved since <HI>Noah</HI>'s flood being in number 415, toge|ther with the Events, whether Prosperous or Ad|verse. Also <HI>Erasmus Bartholinus</HI> hath written upon those Comets, which Books, I have very much wish|ed for a sight of, as supposing I should meet with Passages therein, that would be serviceable to me in my present design: But I could not at this distance from <HI>Europe,</HI> suddenly obtain them.</P>
<P>As for what concerns the <HI>Time,</HI> and other cir|cumstances
<PB REF="000352_0007_0FA4AD9B2E2D78E0">
relating to these <HI>Phaenomenus</HI>; I have been chiefly beholding to the Collections of <HI>Alste|dius, Longomontanus, Kepler, Hevelius</HI> and <HI>Ricciolus</HI> Though <HI>Rockenbachius</HI> is many times cited, I could not obtain the perusal of his Book (it not being in this <HI>American</HI> Wilderness) only I take his Obser|vations upon trust from <HI>Hevelius,</HI> who hath faith|fully expressed what the other hath written. Con|cerning remarkable <HI>Events:</HI> Besides the Authors mentioned&punc; I have consulted <HI>Funccius, Calvisius&punc; Cluverius,</HI> and several other Historians; and if the <HI>Reader</HI> please to take the pains to search the Au|thors quoted in the Margin, or where none is there cited, if he look into <HI>Calvisius</HI> and <HI>Funccius</HI> their Chronologies he will find that things have been truly related. As for Events which have hapned in these late times, it is needless to quote any Au|thor, for that which our own eyes have seen, or ears heard. I know (as the great <HI>Orator</HI> could say) I am not born for my self, but for others&punc; I may hope that my labour herein, will not be altogether unacceptable to the <HI>English Reader,</HI> since there ne|ver was yet (so far as I understand) an attempt of this kind by an <HI>English</HI> hand. My chief design, is to inform and edifie the ordinary sort of <HI>Readers.</HI> Yet considering that God hath made me a debter to the wise as well as to the weak, I have added some things of the <HI>nature, place&punc; motion of Comets,</HI> which only such as have some skill in <HI>Astronomy</HI> can understand; and unto such, hints of that kind will

be both pleasant and profitable; such kind of know|ledge being that which Tradition saith the Holy <HI>Patriarchs</HI> were some of them delighted in.

These late years having been attended with several <HI>Comets,</HI> and there being some who would have the World believe, there is no cause of dread when such <HI>Ensigns</HI> amidst the Heavenly Host, are held up in the sight of all the Earth; I hope the publishing a discourse on the present Subject, will not be judged unseasonable. When the <HI>Benjamites</HI> saw the Flame, with a <HI>Pillar of smoke</HI> (in a proper and literal sense) though be|fore <HI>they knew not that evil was near unto them,</HI> yet then they could not but be sensible of it. <HI>Judge.</HI> 20.34, 40.

<HEAD>A Discourse Concerning COMETS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. That Comets are not in the Air, but in the Starry Heaven. Their Origin and true matter enquired into.</HEAD>
<P>THe Sentiments of learned Men, concerning the place where and the matter out of which <HI>Comets</HI> are made; have been very various. The <HI>Peripa|tetick School</HI> has phansied them to be <HI>Meteors,</HI> generated out of the Bowels of the Earth, exhaled and extolled by the Sun to the supream Region of the Air, and there set on Fire. It would be needless and endless to tell how ma|ny have after <HI>Aristotle</HI> embraced this fiction, but it may not be unprofitable in a few words to evince the contrary, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Comets</HI> are not placed in the <HI>first</HI> heaven or Air, but farr above
<PB N="2" REF="000352_0012_0FA4AD9F7A970600">
it, in the <HI>second</HI> or <HI>Starry Heaven,</HI> and that therefore they are rather <HI>Stars</HI> than <HI>Meteors.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That most learned Mathematici|an <HI>Hevelius</HI> his argument from the mo|tion of <HI>Comets</HI> is irrefragable <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>In Come|tographiae Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Pag.</HI> 132.</NOTE> whate|ver body (saith he) is moved in the great Circle, dividing the Sphaere, and keeping fixed Poles, is certainly Ethe|rial and not Aereal. But this is true of every <HI>Comet</HI>; its diurnal or common mo|tion, is absolved as other Caelestial bo|dies are, which cannot be said of any sort of <HI>Meteors</HI>; yea, the motion there|of is exact and regular, though at first its more swift, and afterwards more slow, yet in that inequality, there is an exact proportion and regularity obser|ved, when as it is otherwise with <HI>Meteors</HI> that are tossed to and fro, and move not through the great Circle. The motion of <HI>Comets</HI> doth very much imitate not that of the <HI>fixed Stars,</HI> but of the <HI>Pla|nets,</HI> whence they are by some called <HI>Pseudo-Planetae</HI>&punc; and by others <HI>Spuri|ous-Planets.</HI> And the Holy Scripture seems to give that name of <HI>Planets</HI> to them, or as our Translation hath it <HI>wan|dring Stars, Jude,</HI> 13. <GAP DESC="foreign"></P>
<P N="2">2. The truth of what we assert, is
<PB N="3" REF="000352_0013_0FA4ADA00E101518">
manifest to those that understand any&punc; thing in the Doctrine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

Germ.</HI> and consequently as far as the Aetherial Heaven. Therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. Learned Men of these later times, wherein light in things natural as well as divine hath been admirably discove|red, have by the help of Mathematical Instruments made ocular demonstrati|ons, that <HI>Comets</HI> are far above this <HI>Aery Heaven,</HI> wherein Animals live and move.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000352_0014_0FA4ADA0ADE279A8"><HI>Kepler</HI> observed the Blazing Star which was seen <HI>A.D.</HI> 1618. to be at its first appearance three times as high as the Moon. <HI>Hevelius</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 5. <HI>P.</HI> 317</NOTE> then whom no man was more industrious and accurate in observing the <HI>Comet, A.

just as Fishes die when lifted a|bove the water; But supposing it to be 80 miles distant from the Earth, and the <HI>Comet</HI> to be there, it would not have been above the Horizon, more then two hours; when as it was so 17 hours. And at the very hour when <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Idem in Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>P.</HI> 151, 155.</NOTE> <HI>Hevelius</HI> did at <HI>Dantzick</HI> observe it to be in the Star near the foot of <HI>Per|sius, Bullialdus</HI> in <HI>Paris</HI> saw it in the very same place, whenas, if it had been no higher then the supream Region of the air, it would have appeared to <HI>Bul|lialdus</HI> (being then in <HI>Paris</HI>) in <HI>Hercu|les</HI> and not in <HI>Persius,</HI> as it did to those in <HI>Dantzick</HI> Nor would a Blazing Star be observed by all the World at once (where the Stars under which it moves, are seen) if it were not above the air. The opinion of <HI>Panaetius,</HI> who thought that a <HI>Comet</HI> was a meer <HI>Emphasis</HI> or <HI>Parelion,</HI> proceeding from the refle|ction of some other Star, is solidly re|futed, from this consideration, that a <HI>Parelion</HI> is not seen in all Countries at once; The same argument proveth that <HI>Comets</HI> have their existence above the air.</P>

<P>It is an easier matter to prove that <HI>Comets</HI> are in the <HI>Aether,</HI> then to de|clare how they came there. Some an|tient Philosophers judged them to be <HI>coaevons</HI> with the Planets, and fixed

<P>Having briefly Discoursed of the place where, and the matter out of which <HI>Comets</HI> have their existence; we now proceed to consider the usual di|stributions of those admirable and a|mazing works of the glorious Creator, <HI>whose works are great, and sought out by those that have pleasure therein.</HI> As for the parts o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which a Comet doth consist there is the <HI>Star</HI> &amp; the <HI>Blaze</HI> proceed|ing therefrom, whence we call them <HI>Blazing Stars.</HI> Or, the <HI>Body</HI> of the <HI>Star,</HI> and the <HI>str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am</HI> that follows or go|eth before it, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> call <HI>Co|ma,</HI> whence such <HI>Phaenomena</HI> have the names of <HI>Comets</HI> given to them. In respect of the <HI>Blaze,</HI> Comets have been distinguished into several sorts. The <HI>Assyrians, Arabians,</HI> and others in old times, were wont from the <HI>colour of the blaze</HI> to denominate the Comet <HI>e. g.</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Mizaldus <HI>de Cometis.</HI></NOTE> when it was of a dark and leadish kind of colour, they called it a <HI>Saturnine</HI>; if of a bright Silver Shining colour, a <HI>Jovial</HI>; if red and fiery, a <HI>Martial</HI>&punc; if of a Golden aspect a <HI>Solar</HI>; if a bright

But the <HI>Latines</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> have distinguished Comets from the <HI>form of the Blaze,</HI> which they appear with. <HI>Pliny</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><HI>Nat. Histor- L.</HI> 2.

next to the Sun, but which is opposite there from. Some antient Writers be|gan a little to take notice of this. But <HI>Appianus</HI> was the first that did fully and clearly discern it to be so, being con|vinced of the truth of this notion, by five several Comets which himself lived to see, <HI>viz.</HI> Those in <HI>Anno.</HI> 1531, 32, 33, 38, 39. Likewise <HI>Gemma,</HI> and <HI>Cornelius Frisius, Fracastorius, Tycho,</HI> and of la|ter times <HI>Gassendus,</HI> and many other fa|mous Mathematicians, and diligent ob|servers of things of this nature whom the learned <HI>Reader</HI> may see quo|ted by <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI> 8. <HI>P.</HI> 432.</NOTE> <HI>Hevelius.</HI> Moreover, <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vbi suprae C.</HI> 6. <HI>P,</HI> 16.</NOTE> <HI>Longomontanus</HI> observeth, that if the Comet have a more lateral disposition towards the Sun, then it will be <HI>Cauda|tus,</HI> but if the opposition to the Sun be more direct, or the Comet elevated a|bove the Sun, then it will be <HI>Crinite,</HI> or the Blaze but short. The blaze is long or short according to the opposition to|wards the Sun, and distance from the Earth. The blaze of some Comets hath extended it self above ninety De|grees. There was one in <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s time that was an 130 Degrees in Lon|gitude. If the Comet be higher then the Sun, the blaze will be short. If the Comet be as low as the Sun, then
<PB N="16" REF="000352_0026_0FA4ADAE8ED04068">
the nearer it is to the Sun, the longer will the blaze appear to be. By the things that have been thus far discour|sed, we may conclude that the time of any Comets appearance cannot certain|ly be praedicted before hand. Some very learned men, (in special the great and noble <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg"><HI>De augmen|tis scienti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rum</HI> P. 242.</NOTE> <HI>Verulam</HI>) have suppo|sed that this knowledge is attainable. Indeed, if Comets were sempiternal bodies, by experience and observation their appearance might be exactly prae|dicted. But since they are generated in the <HI>Aether,</HI> no man can any more tell when they shall be seen, then he can know when a <HI>Paraelion,</HI> or <HI>Draco volans</HI> or the like will be generated in the Air. Yet I will not deny, but that a <HI>probable conjecture,</HI> as to the year of a Comets appearance, may be made from the conjunction of the superiour Planets. It hath been <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Franciscus Junctinus <HI>in Annotationibus de Cometis</HI> Cornelius Gemma <HI>Cos|mogr.</HI> L. 1 C. 18</NOTE> observed that those rare Conjunctions are commonly at|tended with the appearance of some <HI>new Star,</HI> or <HI>Comet:</HI> So indeed it was as to the <HI>Blazing Stars</HI> in 1504, 1506, 1525, 1577, 1583. 1664. notable con|junctions of the Planets did praecede them.

Anno. 1663. conjectured that a Comet would appear the next year: which hapned to be true; and if an <HI>A|strologer</HI> (as the blind man hits the mark) chance to praedict right once, more notice is taken of that, then of his mistaking an hundred times over. Very notable Conjunctions of the Pla|nets hapned this present, and will do so again the next year, (as shall be more particularly mentioned) If any man should now positively affirm, that within this twelve moneth another <HI>Bla|zing Star</HI> will appear, it would be pre|sumptuous, although it is both possible and probable that it may so come to pass. But the observation doth not alwayes hold good; For there have been both greater and lesser Conjun|ctions of the Planets, when no Comet hath appeared, and many Comets with|out any such Conjunctions immediately praeceding. In few words, sometimes, many <HI>Blazing Stars</HI> have been seen within the compass of a few years; there have been at least ten within these eighty years last past. But in some a|ges, not one Comet hath appeared for an hundred years together. Since se|veral may appear (in two, nay) in one year, and it may be not one in fifty nor

in an hundred years, the appearance of such <HI>Phaenomena</HI>'s, cannot be infallibly foreseen by any humane understanding upon Earth.</P>
<P>There are who think, that inasmuch as Comets may be supposed to proceed from natural causes, there is no <HI>speak|ing voice of Heaven</HI> in them, beyond what is to be said of all other works of God. But certain it is, that many things which may happen according to the course of nature, are portentous signs of divine anger, and prognosticks of great evils hastening upon the world A Learned and Judicious Author <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Hevelius <HI>in Cometogr.

<P>A. D. 1577. This year a notable blazing Star amazed the VVorld for three Moneths together. Those famous Mathematicians <HI>Michael Mastlin, Cornelius Gemma,</HI> and <HI>Tycho Brahe,</HI> have written
<PB N="102" REF="000352_0112_0FA4AE3C115D30C0">
largely and learnedly concerning that Comet. It was seen first on the ninth of <HI>November,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> passing through that sign and <HI>Aquarius,</HI> to the midst of <HI>Pisces.</HI> The Star was equal to <HI>Venus</HI> in magnitude, being a compact solid body&punc; and like a little Moon, shi|ning as the purest Silver. The stream differed in colour from the Star, for it was red and fiery, in breadth five Degrees, and in length thirty. To|wards the body of the Star, the rayes were more condensed, but the longer they were distended they appeared to be more scattered and diffused abroad, which argued that the Stream was pro|created by some external light penetrating through the body of the Star; and it was obser|ved to be opposite to the Sun, yet so as that the form of it was bending like a Bow, whose con|vexity was towards the Zenith, and concavity to|wards the <HI>Horizon.</HI> Both <HI>Gemma</HI> and <HI>Tycho</HI> found that this Comet was higher then the Moon. According to <HI>Tycho's</HI> observation, the true Dia|meter of the Star was 368. <HI>Mill. Germ.</HI> so that its proportion to the Earth was as 3 to 14. The Longitude of the Comets tail he found to be 96 Semidiameters of the Earth. He concluded it was not in the Airy but in the <HI>Etherial</HI> VVorld, because it did admit of no sensible Parallax. On <HI>November</HI> 10. the Parallax was 19 12 which was diminished every day until it came to two minutes, and that was a demonstration that the
<PB N="103" REF="000352_0113_0FA4AE3CC4CF6A30">

As for Events, the King of <HI>Persia</HI> died by poyson. The great Turk was slain in Battel, and seventy thousand with him.

<P>A.D. 1618. This year is famous for Blazing Stars, inasmuch as therein no less then four <HI>Co|mets</HI> were observed. The first appeared from <HI>August</HI> 25. to <HI>September</HI> 25. about three hours af|ter midnight, casting its blaze from the East to|wards the West. <HI>September</HI> 1. <HI>Kepler</HI> observed it to be a little below the left foot of <HI>Vrsa major,</HI> and declining towards the head of <HI>Leo,</HI> its moti|on was retrograde. <HI>Sept.</HI> 6. with the naked eye no blaze could be perceived, but with the <HI>Teles|cope</HI> one might perceive it like a thin Cloud: <HI>Sept.</HI> 23. it was come to 29. of <HI>Cancer. Lat. Boreal.</HI> 23. about 10 dayes, deflecting from the Ecliptick Southward, almost 15. Degrees, having a retro|grade motion. The Star was hardly perceivable in <HI>Europe</HI> by reason of its vicinity to the Sun, but in <HI>Persia,</HI> and in the <HI>East-Indies</HI> (though not in <HI>Europe</HI>) continuing from <HI>November</HI> 22&punc; to <HI>De|cember</HI> 13. The fourth and last Comet appear|ing this year, was that which all the Earth looked upon with astonishment. It was first taken notice of <HI>November</HI> 24. and continued to <HI>January</HI> 24. <HI>h.e.</HI> for the space of 60 dayes. There are some now living who remember this blazing Star. But I find a far other kind of Description given of it, in the Books of those learned Mathematicians,
<PB N="109" REF="000352_0119_0FA4AE41E9163810">
who were accurate and diligent observers of this Prodigy, then that which is related by those still alive, that in their youth might see it. There had not the like Comet to this appeared for the space of 150 years.</P>
<P>It was seen first in <HI>Libra,</HI> moving towards the North with some inclination Westward, <HI>viz.</HI> through the midst of <HI>Libra</HI> and <HI>Bootes,</HI> when it came there it might be seen all the night long. The body of the Comet was to appearance big|ger then a Star of the first magnitude, and would sometimes seem to twinkle. <HI>Wendeline, Cusatus</HI> and others that viewed it with a <HI>Telescope,</HI> did to their admiration observe a little Nut or Star in the body of this Comet; after that it was broken into three Stars like Coals of fire in a flaming Oven, after that into a multitude of little Stars which could not be numbred because they would sometimes sparkle out, and otherwhile abscond from the eye. The blaze was narrow near the Star, but broad at a distance from it. At its first appearance it bended like a Bow, but afterwards it appeared straight. The Colour of the Blaze near the Star was red and fiery, but towards the end of it white and pale, very much resembling the <HI>Via Lactea.

Remarkable Events, attending these Comets, were, the death of the Emperour and Empress. A drought all that Winter; An Earth-quake (which hapned on the day when the first of these Comets appeared) in <HI>Italy</HI> removed a Mountain which fell upon the Town of <HI>Plours,</HI> whereby an 1500. persons were crushed to death in a moment.

And the Prince <HI>Palatine,</HI> King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> dispos|sessed of his haereditary Estate, forced to fly for his life, and his Countrey made a desolation. Quickly after these Blazing Stars, God sent the Plague amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> here in <HI>New-England</HI> which swept them away in such numbers, as that the living were not enough to bury the dead.

A terrible Plague in <HI>En|gland</HI> the like never known there before this time, so that in <HI>London</HI> (besides what was in some other parts of the Nation) there died sometimes a|bove seventeen thousand in one week; and more then an hundred thousand were swept away in a years time in that one City by the besome of De|struction which the Lord sent amongst them. The next year the <HI>Papists</HI> set <HI>London</HI> on fire; which dreadful Conflagration continued for several dayes, until eighty seven Parishes were consumed by those fatal flames.

<P>As for Events; many places were this year sorely afflicted with <HI>Earth quakes.</HI> In <HI>Asia,</HI> there was an horrendous <HI>Earth-quake</HI> which con|tinued for 80 dayes together. The Cities of
<PB N="120" REF="000352_0130_0FA4AE4EE5734F90">
<HI>Begbara, Angora,</HI> and several other Towns suf|fered much thereby. The City of <HI>Tocall</HI> was wholly levelled to the ground. <HI>Polio</HI> (a conside|rable City) was destroyed, a thousand and eight hundred persons being killed by their Houses fal|ling upon them. <HI>Torqueto</HI> (another considerable City) was overthrown in a moment, and above six thousand persons lost their lives, being buried in the ruins, of the City. Also several places in <HI>Europe</HI> were affrighted with Earth-quakes this year: particularly <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and <HI>Adrianople,</HI> but especially <HI>Raguse</HI> which was in a great part destroyed. Also the Plague broke out, in the chief City of the <HI>European Tartary</HI>; and in great <HI>Poland,</HI> and in <HI>Paccardy,</HI> it raged in <HI>Donay, Ghent</HI> and other places. A fire in <HI>Moscow</HI> de|stroyed thirty thousand Houses, and five hundred <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Chappels</HI>; a great part of the Cities of <HI>Gottenbourg,</HI> and <HI>Stetin,</HI> were this year also consumed by fire. In the Countrey about <HI>Cadiz</HI> there was a great Drought, so as that the Death of many of their Cattle was occasioned thereby. The <HI>Turks</HI> made very furious Assaults upon <HI>Can|dia,</HI> which was the next year surrendred to them. The King of <HI>Poland</HI> resigned his Crown into the hands of the States, by which means that King|dome was involved in troubles and confusions.

<P>A.D. 1677. A Comet appeared in the sign <HI>Taurus,</HI> between the Base of the Triangle, and the unformed Stars in the Cloud of <HI>Aries.</HI> The head of it was in a right line with the heart of <HI>Cassiopeja</HI> and the <HI>Alamak.</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Robert Hooks</HI> Remarks upon this Comet.</NOTE> It seemed to be about the bigness of a Star of the first magni|tude, but of a much fainter and duller Light.

<P>As for Events following this Comet; within a year a Town in <HI>Piedmont</HI> called <HI>Bosia</HI> suddenly sunk down into the Earth, so as that nothing of it appeared, only two persons in the whole Town that escaped with their lives. But I find that some late Writers in <HI>England,</HI> think that this Co|met was an <HI>Omen</HI> of the late Horrid Popish Plot, wherein it was resolved that the Protestant Name should no more be had in remembrance, which hellish design was ripe for Execution, had not He which sits in the Heavens prevented. It was before observed, that <HI>Hamans</HI> bloody Conspiracy to cut off the Lords People, was attended with a Bla|zing Star. And why might not this Combination of the <HI>Antichristian</HI> party (which was worse then that of <HI>Hamans</HI>) be so too? Now as the Dis|covery of <HI>Haman</HI> (who was a Type of <HI>Anti-Christ</HI>) his wicked contrivance, ended in the ut|ter destruction of himself, and of his Children; So the Lord grant that the revealing of this Po|pish Plot may issue in the ruine of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> and of those that do uphold him; and let every Man that fears God, or that bears any love to his Name and Truth, say&punc; <HI>Amen</HI>!</P>
<P>A&punc;D. 1680. The motion of the Comet which appeared this year, was diligently followed by
<PB N="123" REF="000352_0133_0FA4AE5218E3B440">
the Ingenious Mr. <HI>John Foster,</HI> the late Printer in <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI> And though he be gone (not without a publick loss by his death and the sorrow of many) it being mentioned amongst evil <HI>Omens,</HI> that the cunning Artificer shall be taken away) he hath left behind him, some of his Ob|servations concerning this Comet. It was first here taken notice of <HI>Nov.</HI> 14. at 5. <HI>h.</HI> A.M. near 18 Degrees of <HI>Libra.</HI> 1 <HI>Gr.</HI> and 30. <HI>min. Lat. Austral. Nov.</HI> 19. It was within a Degree of <HI>Spica Virginis,</HI> directing its course <HI>Northward</HI> a|bout 40. <HI>min.</HI> Several Mornings after that were cloudy here in <HI>Boston,</HI> and not long after it was in conjunction with the Sun, so that it was seen no more in the Morning. It was then conjectured that within a few dayes it would appear in the E|vening, and so it did <HI>Dec.</HI> 10. when only the <HI>Blaze</HI> and not the <HI>Star</HI> was to us visible. <HI>December</HI> 12. Its <HI>Blaze</HI> appeared very red and fiery, extending as far as the breast of the <HI>Swan. Dec.</HI> 14. its head was first discerned, the Blaze passing to the North-ward of <HI>Cor Aquilae. Dec.</HI> 16&punc; its appear|ance was very terrible, the Blaze ascended above 60 Degrees almost to its <HI>Zenith,</HI> growing conti|nually broader from the head, and was brightest on both ends, especially on the South side, the middle considerably darker then either of the sides. <HI>Jan.</HI> 8. Gave the fairest opportunity to find its true place and parallax, by its approach to a fixed Star of the third Magnitude, in the

right shoulder of <HI>Andromeda.</HI> At 6. <HI>h.</HI> 5. <HI>m.</HI> it was 28. <HI>m.</HI> distant from that Star. At 50. <HI>m.</HI> past 6. its distance was 25. <HI>m.</HI> At 10. <HI>h.</HI> 5. <HI>m.</HI> The Comet passing by the said Star, left it 12. <HI>m.</HI> Southward. Its visible hourly motion was 6. <HI>m.</HI> direct, which if compared with its daily motion, we shall find it little (if at all) retarded by rea|son of its <HI>Parallax,</HI> which is an evidence of its vast distance from the Earth. For if it had not been much higher then the Moon, its true motion would have far exceeded its visible. About the middle of <HI>February,</HI> it vanished out of our sight.</P>
<P>As for Remarkable Events, attending this Bla|zing Star, We that live in <HI>America</HI> know but little of the great Motions in <HI>Europe,</HI> much less in <HI>A|frica</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> until a long time afterwards. On|ly we are informed of some considerable Commo|tions the last year, between the <HI>Tartars</HI> and the <HI>Chineses.</HI> Likewise in <HI>Hungaria,</HI> some things worthy of Remark have hapned. Above four hundred Villages in that Countrey have lately been laid desolate by Sword and Fire. The <HI>Turks</HI> have an Army on foot there, and it is strange to consider (only God maketh the Earth to help the Woman) that those Barbarous Infidels, should declare unto the Emperour of <HI>Germany,</HI> that they will not be at peace with him, except he do's restore unto the oppressed <HI>Protestants</HI> their liber|ties and estates which have been unjustly taken
<PB N="125" REF="000352_0135_0FA4AE532E88DF50">
from them. The Pope has disposed of the Ecclesi|astical 10<HI>th.</HI> in the State <HI>Millan</HI> to be imployed in a war against the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Protestants. This last Summer the Protestants (commonly called <HI>Re|bels</HI>) in those parts have had Wonderful succes|ses against the Popish Generation. It is possible this may be a <HI>beginning of Revenges upon the Ene|my.</HI> The great expectation, is, that the next year the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> will come in person against the Emperour, with the most formidable Army which hath been known in the World for these many a|ges. It may be another (the last and most fatal) blast of the second wo Trumpet, is now about to sound. In the Summer after this <HI>Blazing Star,</HI> there was an afflictive Drought&punc; not only in <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> but in <HI>Europe.</HI> The next (<HI>i. e.</HI> the last) win|ter, there was a great Inundation in the <HI>Nether|lands</HI>; many thousands peri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hed in the fatal night when those great Waters came nigh unto them. It is said that those Provinces suffered more by that Inundation, then by all the <HI>French</HI> Wars which of late have been so heavy upon them. The poor Protestants in <HI>France,</HI> are blazing in a flame of Persecution. The <HI>French KING</HI> in his De|claration newly come forth, boasts that he hath caused several Millions of Protestants to forsake their holy Profession, and to turn <HI>Roman Catho|licks</HI>; He also and the Pope are quarelling who shall be Pope in <HI>France.</HI> Yea his hand seems to be against every one, and every mans against him,

the issue whereof must needs in probability be some great overturnings and alteration of the pre|sent State of Affairs in <HI>Europe.</HI> And besides these particulars (which are considerable) other things have come to pass in <HI>Europe</HI> since the Co|met last mentioned, which deserve to have a Re|mark set upon them. For the last year there was a terrible conflagration in <HI>Moscow</HI> (it begun in a Stable) whereby four thousand Houses were consumed, and turned into ruinous heaps. And this last Summer the great City of <HI>Plesco,</HI> is made desolate by fire, not above seventy Houses remain|ing. Also the <HI>Czar</HI> (or <HI>Emperour</HI>) of <HI>Musco|via</HI> is lately dead; and his Death hath occasioned a very great Commotion about a Successour to the Crown. At first his Brother was Proclaimed; but the City of <HI>Mosco</HI> rose up in Arms about it, and the Souldiers there have lately made a dismal slaughter amongst the Nobility and chief Citizens, deposing the late <HI>Czar</HI>'s Brother, and setting up his Uncle as Emperour in his stead. For three dayes together (<HI>viz.</HI> 15, 16, &amp; 17 of <HI>May</HI> last) things in that great and imperial City, were in the strangest Confusion imaginable; on the seventh day of <HI>June</HI> last, a terrible <HI>Earth-quake</HI> hapned in that part of the World, continuing for the space of half an hour, whereby many stately Fabricks were thrown down to the ground, and an hundred lives destroyed by their fall.

in a very awful manner, so as that the Floods occasioned by the great Rains, have destroyed many Towns in <HI>Sicily.</HI> We hear that Mount <HI>Aetna</HI> (which has been wont to vomit Fire) has of late cast out such an abundance of Water, as that the Neighbouring Countrey is drowned thereby. We hear also, that on the sixth day of <HI>June</HI> last, a most prodigious Tempest hapned in <HI>Sicily,</HI> whereby the Town of <HI>Randazzo, Franca|ville,</HI> and <HI>Tortorica</HI> became subject to a sudden and unexpected ruin. About half an hour before Sun|set, there hapned so great a darkness, as that no object could be distinguished at the distance of four paces; after which there arose an amazing Storm of Rain, Thunder and Lightning&punc; which lasted for thirty six hours. About one of the clock in the Morning, great Torrents fell upon the Neighbouring Mountains, with such irresist|able fury, as that Trees of extraordinary bigness were carried away before them, which coming a|gainst <HI>Tortorica</HI> threw down the Walls and Hou|ses thereof, 600. of the Inhabitants were drowned.

<P>A.D. 1682.

If that Relation be true, there have been two Co|mets (or one hath twice appeared) this present year. For it is certain that there was one visible in <HI>August</HI> last. Some had a sight of it <HI>August</HI> 15. for my own part, I saw it not until <HI>August</HI> 18. 3. <HI>h.</HI> A.M when it was in the foreclaw of <HI>Vrsa major.</HI> The stream about 10.

It was then perceived by us in <HI>N.E.</HI> only in the morning, whenas I am in|formed by Letters from <HI>London,</HI>that they saw it in the Evening the same night when we beheld it in the morning only. By reason of its septen|trional Latitude, tis past doubt that in the more Nor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hern Climates it was seen both in the morning and in the evening of the same day, yea all the night long, as hath been noted concerning the Co|mets appearing <HI>Annis</HI> 1432, 1470, 1513, 1607. <HI>August</HI> 23. it was by us in <HI>New-England</HI> seen in the Evening only, having removed from the place we first saw it in, about 39 Degrees, and was come near <HI>Coma Berenices</HI>; not considerably changing its Latitude, but moving in a line almost

parallel with the Ecliptick. Thus it passed through <HI>Coma Berenices</HI>&punc; and through the leg of <HI>Bootes&punc; August</HI> 31. Its Latitude was diminished from 24. to 16. <HI>Gr.</HI> It was come between the feet of <HI>Bootes,</HI> about 75. Degrees from the place we first saw it in.

<P>There is an Anonymous Astrologer in <HI>London</HI> (some of whose Notions are taken out of <HI>Gadbu|ries</HI> Book of Comets, Printed <HI>Anno</HI> 1665.) that has published his Sentiments upon this Comet; presumptuously determining not only what the Events are which shall attend this, with the for|mer Blazing Stars, but the places, yea and persons concerned therein. No man of wisdome and judgement can relish the boldness of such a Pro|phet after; Especially considering that he does praedict things that are contrary to the Scriptures of Truth. He prophesies of the <HI>Turks</HI> Con|version, and consequently Salvation; when as the sure Word of Prophesie unto which we shall do well to give heed, informs us that the <HI>Turk</HI> shall come to his end, and there shall be none to help him, <HI>Numb.</HI> 24.24. <HI>Dan.</HI> 11.45. <HI>Rev.</HI> 9.15. The vain Astrologer likewise affirms, that <HI>Rome</HI> shall be destroyed by the <HI>Turkish</HI> power, when as the
<PB N="130" REF="000352_0140_0FA4AE5AD38FD000">

If men did with under|standing read the Scriptures more, they would mind Judicial Astrologers less. This notwithstand|ing I find that judicious Writers are of Opinion, that such a <HI>Saturnine</HI> Comet as this was, hath a natural influence into, and therefore does portend a cold and tedious Winter, much Snow, and con|sequently great Floods; Malignant and Epidemi|cal Diseases; in special the Plague: concerning which <HI>Deus avertat Omen</HI>!

We are also ascertained, that about the middle of <HI>September</HI> last (the Comet being hardly out of sight) there was a very prodigious Tempest in <HI>Italy.</HI> Not far from <HI>Florence</HI> there hapned most terrible Thunder and Hail mingled with Fire; the Hail-stones were many of them three, some of them five pound in weight; the like was never known in those parts; The wild Beasts and Birds were killed thereby.

Judi|cious <HI>Zanchy</HI> (as well as <HI>Mede</HI>) conceives that by the <HI>Pillars of Smoke</HI> spoken of in the Prophet <HI>Joel,</HI> as portentous of the amazing and terrible things which were coming upon the <HI>Jewish Nation</HI> Blazing Stars are meant, he saith that when he lived at <HI>Strasburge,</HI> there was a Comet seen; after which the death of some great Personages, and civil Wars in <HI>France</HI> ensued: and addeth <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">De operibus Dei, L. 3.

So that they are preachers of divine wrath, and the consequences of them prove fatal unto some or other, in which respect all ought to walk with an holy fear of the infinite Majesty, who doth whatsoever he pleaseth in Heaven and Earth, in the Sea&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in all deep places, and ac|cordingly causeth such tokens to appear in the Heavens when it seemeth good unto him.

that the true Planets and fixed Stars have a natural influence into such things, though the manner of their operation is by us silly Mortals undeclarable. <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.14. <HI>Deut.</HI> 33.13, 14. <HI>Judg.</HI> 5.20. <HI>Job</HI> 38.31, 32, 33.

The light which the Moon recei|veth from the Sun hath a physical and wonderful influence upon the Earth, so may the Beams which blaze through a Cometical body have likewise.

Moreover, as there are contrary Interests in the World, so that may be happy for one, that will be woful for the other. And although such evil Events as those in the preceding Chapters related, have sometimes hapned without any blazing star imme|diately forerunning, that doth not prove, that when such signs do appear in heaven, they are not signal of miseries not far off.

Will any man there|fore say, that such apparitions are not to be ac|counted ominous or significative that evils of that nature are like to ensue?

<P>And as for this last <HI>Blazing Star,</HI> which is ge|nerlly disregarded amongst Men in the World, it seemeth to be the more Ominous, in that some rare <HI>Conjunctions of the Superiour Planets</HI> happen this year also. <HI>October</HI> 20. There was a Con|junction of <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Jupiter</HI> in <HI>Leo,</HI> there ha|ving been in the praeceding Moneth of <HI>September,</HI> first a Conjunction of <HI>Iupiter</HI> and <HI>Mars,</HI> and then of <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Mars</HI> in the same sign. And (which is notable because unusual) these two superiour Planets make two Conjunctions more

in the same sign, the one in the next Moneth, <HI>viz.</HI> on the thirtieth of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> in the 18. Degree of <HI>Leo</HI>; the other the sixth of <HI>May</HI> next in the sixteenth Degree of the same sign. As for those great Conjunctions of all the Planets which hap|pen but once in 794. years, there have been but seven of them since the World begun. The se|cond of which was attended with <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood. The third with the overthrow of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> when the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were brought out of the Land of <HI>Aegypt.</HI> The fourth with the Captivi|ty of the <HI>Ten Tribes.</HI> The fifth with the begin|ning of the Christian, and the Destruction of the <HI>Iewish World.</HI> The sixth with the division of the Empire in the dayes of <HI>Carolus Magnus.</HI> The Last was 79. years ago.

<P>Whether any of these have guessed right, he that lives thirteen years hence, will be better able to say: I am apt to believe that ere this Century be expired, there will be very great Revolutions in the World. But besides these general ones, there are particular Conjunctions of the two Su|periour Planets, which meet together once in (about) 20 years, and use to continue in their con|junction, until <HI>Mars</HI> come and joyn with them; and then it is admirable to behold three great Stars shining in the same sign in the Heavens&punc; with|out any scintillation, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">v <HI>Kepler</HI> Epit.
