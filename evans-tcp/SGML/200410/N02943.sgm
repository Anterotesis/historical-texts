<HEAD>The Publisher TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>UNdoubtedly every one, acquainted with the origi|nal Principles of <HI>New-England,</HI> and a true Friend to that good Cause of a further Reformation, which brought the first Fathers of this Country from their native Land over the dangerous Seas to a distant Wilderness, will esteem the <HI>Subject</HI> of the ensuing Pages well worthy the closest Consideration, and such as may justly recommend this controversial Piece to a serious Perusal.</P>
<P>And as to the <HI>Form</HI> of the Composure, it may be remark'd; this <HI>interlocutory</HI> way of writing has been found by Experience very acceptable to Mankind, and many Authors have gone into it for the Ease, the Benefit, and Satisfaction of the Rea|der. It certainly approaches the nearest to <HI>personal Confe|rence,</HI> which is ordinarily the most eligible manner of ma|naging a Dispute; as it carries this on in familiar Language, prosecutes it by short Periods, and when the Disputants are wise to preserve a just Temper, gives the best Opportunity of settling the determinate sense of one another's Terms, of bringing Things to a narrow, and keeping to the Pinch of the Controversy; and so affords the best Prospect of reducing it to an issue. The like Advantages now attend this manner of discussing a difficult and controverted Point, by way of written <HI>Dialogue.</HI></P>
<P>The frequent Interchange of Arguments, the quick Return of Objections and Replies, in this mode of writing, takes off from the tediousness of the Dispute, invites the Rea|der on, engages his Attention, helps his Memory, and assists
<PB N="ii" REF="003528_0004_0FF858CCCCAF92E8">
him in forming a Judgment. And then it hath been ob|serv'd, <Q>The managing of an Argument in the Form of a Dialogue has this Convenience, that it allows more Free|dom, and gives Advantage for impressing some Things, which common Readers wou'd not so readily take notice of, in a continu'd Discourse.</Q></P>
<P>Nevertheless it must be acknowledg'd, there's one <HI>Abuse</HI> this Method of Deba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e is incident to: and that is, the Wri|ter for want of sufficient Skill in personating, or of Faith|fulness in representing, may give a vast Advantage to that Side of the Question his own Principles incline him to, by making the opposite Party argue inconsistently, or discourse very weakly: and so prepare the way for an easy Victory and inglorious Insult over him.</P>
<P>But I can assure the Reader, from my Knowledge of our Author, and from the Testimony of very capable Judges, who have had his Performance under a critical Inspection, that there's no Occasion in the least to suspect the present Publication of an unequal or partial management. You will here find the Arguings of both Parties very naturally re|presented, and Things set in their genuine Light, on one Side as well as the other. If any shou'd pats a different Censure, it may so happen, that herein they will expose their own Partiality, or betray their Ignorance. However if any have a mind to make their Remarks, they may try their Skill, in detecting the Author's Fallacy in one part of the Argument, or his Weakness in the other. And I dare say in his behalf, he is open to Conviction, and stands ready to retract what he cannot vindicate.</P>
<P>In fine, let it be no Prejudice in the Reader's way, that our Author has not seen meet to prefix his <HI>Name.</HI> For I have observ'd, that Writings of this Form (at least such as have occur'd to me) are generally anonymous. However, 'tis not the Authority of a Name, but the Justice of the Cause, and force of the Reasoning, that ought to be regarded. On these heads an Appeal is now made to the World, and the whole submitted to publick Censure.</P>

<HEAD>In Two Conferences.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="conference">
<HEAD>The FIRST CONFERENCE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ELeutherius</HI> was a Gentleman of a plen|tiful Substance, a liberal Education, and of a serious Disposition; early design'd for the Service of God, in the Gospel of his Son: and possess'd those ministerial Qualifications, as would have intitled him to some of the highest Preferments in the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Church, had he consulted his pro|motion in the choice of his Profession, and declared himself for the national Establishment. But upon a most serious and deliberate weighing the Cause, he
<PB N="2" REF="003528_0006_0FF858D2971D9270">
found the Principles of the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> more agrea|ble to the Word of God, and to the Practice of the first and purest Ages of Christianity, than those of the <HI>E|piscopalians;</HI> and was therefore constrained to join himself to that despised Party. This being matter of great grief to some of his ambitious and aspiring Friends, whose Heads ran much upon his Promotion, occasion'd him a Visit from one of them, a <HI>Clergyman</HI> of the establish'd Church; a warm Advocate for Li|turgy and Prelacy, and a Man of Powers, as well as Zeal; who thinking himself capable of refuting the Presbyterian Opinions, and oblig'd in Charity to use some Pains for the recovery of his Friend, came to spend an Evening in an amicable Debate with him; which he introduced with the following Salutation.</P>
<P><HI>Praelaticus.</HI> Sir, the near Relation between us, and our former freedom and intimacy, have embolden'd me to enter into your Retirement; and to deprive you for an Hour, of the sweet Satisfaction of conver|sing with the Dead, that I might in your Study have the advantage of a free Conference with you, with|out the interruption, or observation of others.</P>
<P><HI>Eleutherius.</HI> I must confess, Sir, that I find very a|greable entertainment among my Books; but I have not undertaken the <HI>Hermit,</HI> nor immured my self in my Study as a <HI>Cell,</HI> where I shall be shut up from the Company of my Friends, and deprived of the satis|faction of such entertaining and delightful Conversa|tion, as your's has always been to me. I am therefore troubl'd at your Apology for that freedom, which you have a just claim to, and which I have greatest reason to delight in. And can't but hope that you will yet continue my Friend, and manifest your kindness, by your usual free and unreserv'd converse.</P>
<P><HI>Prelat.</HI> I shall then follow your directions, and without ceremony or preamble, unbosom my grief to you, occasion'd by your herding your self with a <HI>schismatical</HI> and <HI>phanatical</HI> Party; and your pretend|ing to enter into <HI>Sacred Orders</HI> among those, that have
<PB N="3" REF="003528_0007_0FF858D5E0FF8668">
no Power to give them, and to undertake the Work of the Ministry without regular <HI>Ordination.</HI> By this you cut your self off from those temporal Honours and Advantages, which you had reason to expect; as well as thrust your self into Christ's Vineyard with|out a Call, and <HI>climb into his Sheepfold another way than by the door.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> I make no doubt but your hearty friend|ship to me, and your zeal for what you think the Cause of God, has thus transported you, beyond that can|dour and calmness of Spirit, for which you have been noted; and has occasion'd those hard Epithets, which you are pleased to apply to the <HI>Presbyterians.</HI> I will therefore if you please, in the most open and unre|served manner possible, offer you the Reasons that have determined my Choice, and then carefully attend to the Arguments, you'l offer against my Principles and Conduct.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> I'm well pleased with the Proposal, and am ready to hear your Reasons (such as you have) for forsaking <HI>the best constituted</HI> Church in the World, a Church in which you were baptized, unto which you owe your best Services; and in which you ought to have lived and died. I confess I cannot account for your Conduct.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> I shall not dispute the propriety of those <HI>Panegyricks</HI> upon the <HI>Church of England,</HI> we so often hear from your party. Every one esteems his own profession best, and the Church to which he belongs the best constituted. It is now my business to give you my Reasons, why I differ from you in Opinion, with respect to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> And it may be proper to inform you what gave the first turn to my Thoughts.</P>
<P>Having read the ecclesiastical Story of ourKingdom since the <HI>Reformation,</HI> I was surpriz'd to find such Clouds of Sufferers for Nonconformity to <HI>Prelacy</HI> and <HI>Ceremony.</HI> What a dark Scene opened, before the <HI>U|surpation,</HI> of Silencing, Imprisonments, Pillories and
<PB N="4" REF="003528_0008_0FF858D8E0886E20">
Death! How many Martyrs were there to this Cause! What multitudes of the best Men in the Nation, were driven from their pleasant Habitations, among the wild Pagans in an <HI>American Desert,</HI> chusing to for|sake their dear Country, and dearest Friends, to under|go the perils of the Sea, and the greater perils of bar|barous Salvages, in a <HI>bowling Wilderness,</HI> rather than wound their Consciences, by a compliance with what they thought sinful! How severe were the Persecu|tions after the <HI>Restoration,</HI> when above two thousand of the most learned and pious Ministers in <HI>England</HI> were silenced in one Day; and left without any vi|sible means of Subsistence for themselves and Fami|lies, for mere Nonconformity! How many of these afterward were stript of their Estates, languished and died in Prisons, for preaching the Gospel, which they da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">'d not neglect to do! And if we look into <HI>Scot|land</HI> in the same Reign, we shall find all their <HI>Mini|stry</HI> turned out, some thousands suffering <HI>Martyrdom</HI> in the most cruel and inhuman manner, for their non|compliance with <HI>Prelacy.</HI> This now put me upon thinking, that these Sufferers must certainly have some convincing evidence for the goodness of their Cause, that could bear them up under all these terrors; and make them venture upon <HI>Death</HI> it self, in his most affrightning form; rather than comply with our Eng|lish <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">posed <HI>Ceremonies.</HI> And tho' I did not suppose, suffering in a Cause was a sure evi|dence of the goodness of it: yet I could not but think, that the Sufferings of so many excellently learn|ed and godly Men, called upon me to search into the merits of that Cause, for which they suffered.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> I am as far from justifying those severities as you are. But these were the fault of the particu|lar Persons then at the Helm; and not of the Con|stitution.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> This will not appear so, upon a view of the History of those Times. But if it really were so; yet the Cause sealed with so much <HI>Blood,</HI> and I fear <HI>Blood</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="003528_0009_0FF858DA71E51A10">
that is yet crying under the Altar, is worth enquiring into. And that consideration put me accordingly up|on the enquiry into the merits of the Cause, until a rational <HI>Conviction</HI> has brought me into the <HI>Opinion</HI> you now oppose.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> I am waiting to hear the Reasons of that <HI>Conviction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> I have many Objections against your <HI>Cere|monies,</HI> and especially against <HI>Impositions,</HI> and making such terms of Communion, as Christ has never made. But I shall confine my self to the consideration of the Subject, you have led me into: and give you the Reasons why I chuse <HI>Ordination</HI> by a <HI>Presbytery,</HI> ra|ther than by a <HI>Diocesan Bishop;</HI> and why I esteem this more agreable to the Institution of the Lord Je|sus Christ.</P>
<P>Now one Reason of my <HI>Opinion</HI> is, because our Lord Jesus Christ has inhibited all <HI>Dominion</HI> and <HI>Supremacy</HI> among the Ministers of the Gospel over one another; and all <HI>Lordship</HI> exercised by any of them, over the Flock committed to their Care. Whence I cannot but esteem all the <HI>Pastors</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> upon a le|vel in point of Authority; and all exercise of <HI>Domi|nion,</HI> over their Brethren, or over the Flock, by a <HI>Prelacy,</HI> to be a direct opposition to Christ's express Command. And therefore I conclude that a <HI>Prelate</HI> is at best but a human Creature, and not of Christ's appointing.</P>
<P>That our blessed Lord has prohibited all <HI>Dominion</HI> and <HI>Supremacy</HI> among the Ministers of the Gospel, is evident from <HI>Matth.</HI> xx. 25, 26. <HI>Ye know, that the prin|ces of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them; and they that are great, exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you; but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your Minister.</HI> And to the same purpose, <HI>Luk.</HI> xxii. 24, 25, 26.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> It is <HI>secular Dominion</HI> and Dignity, that is here forbidden; and that nothing affects the pre|sent
<PB N="6" REF="003528_0010_0FF858DCE91C8170">
Argument. For it's only an ecclesiastical <HI>Supre|macy,</HI> that we contend for.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> If it be as you say, I think it nevertheless affects the Argument, we are upon. For have our <HI>Bishops</HI> no <HI>secular Dominion,</HI> over their Brethren in the Ministry? Are they not spiritual Lords, members of the Legislature, and often at the Council-Table? Don't their <HI>secular Dominion</HI> very much render them uncapable to <HI>preach the Word instantly, in season and out of season,</HI> as exhorted 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 2? Is there no <HI>secular Dominion</HI> in the <HI>Bishops</HI> Courts? So that by your own interpretation of this Text, <HI>Episcopacy</HI> of the present Form seems repugnant to this Command of Christ, and therefore not very desirable, to be sure not necessary.</P>
<P>But it's certain from the forequoted Texts, that affectation of Pre-eminence is what our Lord con|demns. There was a Strife among the Disciples which should be accounted the greatest; upon which he takes occasion to let them know, that there must be no <HI>greatest</HI> or <HI>least</HI> among them: they must not (like the Kings of the Gentiles,) exercise <HI>Lordship</HI> or <HI>Authority</HI> over one another. <HI>But he that is greatest among you</HI> (says he) <HI>let him be as the younger; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e that is chief, as he that doth serve.</HI> So that all <HI>Lordship,</HI> all <HI>Authority</HI> over one another, is expresly forbidden. And this affects <HI>Diocesan Episcopacy,</HI> just so much, as it is a <HI>Dominion</HI> over <HI>Presbyters.</HI></P>
<P>And I might further observe to you, that all <HI>Mini|sters</HI> of the Gospel are forbidden to exercise a <HI>Lord|ship over God's Heritage,</HI> 1 Pet. v. 3. which also pre|judices me against our english <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> under which such a <HI>Lordship</HI> seems to be exercised. I can have no better opinion of imposing their <HI>Minister</HI> upon a Congregation, without the People's Consent, than taking from them even a natural Right of com|mitting their most important Affairs to one that they can approve; and thereby exercising an unwarrant|able <HI>Lordship</HI> over them. And I must tell you, 'tis
<PB N="7" REF="003528_0011_0FF858DF4CA30BE0">
a <HI>Lordship</HI> the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves would not use, in supplying the vacancy made by the death of <HI>Judas, Acts</HI> i. 15, 22. And in the election of <HI>Deacons, Acts</HI> vi. 3, 5. In both which cases, the Suffrage of the Brethren was called for. And therefore I care not to be set over a People in your <HI>lordly</HI> manner. I cannot but in like manner complain of the <HI>Spiritual Courts,</HI> as they are called, for <HI>Lording it over God's Heritage:</HI> Where, instead of the Discipline instituted by Christ, the Church-offender is carried from Court to Court, at intolerable Charges, subjected to heavy Fines, exorbitant Fees, or Imprisonment, without any method taken to bring him to a sincere Repentance. Indeed, Sir, I cannot see through these Things, and therefore cannot be a Partaker in them.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> There is no Constitution perfect, and if you see some things in our Church, that you think want mending, yet you must own, our <HI>Ministry</HI> is such as Christ has appointed; and therefore you ought not to separate, for such small dissatisfactions.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> Pardon me, Sir, if I don't see with your eyes. The <HI>Prelacy</HI> it self is what I cannot think of divine Appointment. I find nothing in Scripture, of the <HI>Superiority</HI> of one ordinary <HI>Minister</HI> of the Gospel over another; but have shewed you, that this <HI>Domi|nation</HI> is absolutely forbidden. Nor do I find any war|rant for the ecclesiastical Authority exercised over both <HI>Minister</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> in the <HI>Bishop's</HI> name. If there be any mention in the Bible, of <HI>Chancellors, Deans, Registers, Apparitors, Proctors,</HI> &amp;c. be pleased to shew it me; if not, you'l allow me to refuse your Hierarchy, and join with a <HI>Ministry</HI> that is manifestly of Christ's Institution, and not of human Invention.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat. Ordination</HI> by <HI>Bishops</HI> is certainly of divine Institution For <HI>Bishops</HI> are <HI>Presbyters,</HI> if they have no higher Character: and therefore upon your own Principles, have power of <HI>Ordination;</HI> whereas <HI>Or|dination</HI> by <HI>Presbyters,</HI> is at least questionable: and therefore ours must be allowed to be the safest side.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="003528_0012_0FF858E274B84AC8"><HI>Eleuth.</HI> This is the constant clamour of your Par|ty: but you know who claim equal advantage to their Cause by this way of arguing. The <HI>Baptists</HI> plead, that we own their Baptism is valid, while they deny that the Sprinkling of an In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ant is any Baptism at all; and therefore they must be of the safer side. So the <HI>Papists</HI> argue after the same manner, that all own Salvation may be obtained by some in the Com|munion of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> but they deny the possibility of the Salvation of Protestants; and there|fore the Papists are of the safer side. This you know is the great <HI>popular Argument</HI> they assault us with. And I would refer you to your own Arch-bishop <HI>Til|lotson</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Serm. on</HI> 1 Cor. 3. 15.</NOTE> for an Answer to it; and therein for an Ans|wer to your self. You will find that celebrated Au|thor detecting the <HI>gross Absurdities,</HI> which follow from this Argument; in particular. "That according to this Principle it is always safest to be on the <HI>un|charitable side;</HI> also giving some <HI>parallel Instances,</HI> by which it will be clearly seen that this Argument concludes false; and shewing by a variety of Consi|derations, that this is so far from being a <HI>good</HI> Argu|ment, that it is so intolerably <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>sophistical,</HI> that any considerate Man ought to be asham'd to be catcht by it". This might suffice for a Reply to you.</P>
<P>However I will not rest in these general Remarks, but shall particularly expostulate the matter with you. <HI>Is it the safest side</HI> to acknowledge and submit to a Hierarchy not warranted in the Book of God? Is it the safest side, for me to solemnly declare at my <HI>Or|dination,</HI> that I am moved by the HOLY GHOST, to take upon me the Office of a <HI>Deacon,</HI> when I have no purpose to <HI>serve Tables,</HI> for which <HI>Deacons</HI> were instituted; but to <HI>give my self continually, to Prayer and to the Ministry of the Word?</HI> Is it the safest side, to take upon me the Order of <HI>Priesthood,</HI> an Order typical of our Lord Jesus Christ, fulfilled in him,
<PB N="9" REF="003528_0013_0FF858E4C14DFFE8">
and abrogated by him? Is it the safest side to take upon me the solemn Charge of the Ministry, and to come under awful Vows to fulfil it; and yet to de|pend upon the <HI>Bishops</HI> Licence to preach? For you know that <HI>Canon</HI> 49th inhibits <HI>any Person what|soever, that is not licensed, to take upon him to expound in his own Cure or elsewhere, any Scripture or Matter of Doctrine.</HI> Is it the safest side, to acknowledge our <HI>Bishops</HI> endued with the extraordinary <HI>Apostoli|cal</HI> power, of giving the Holy Ghost by the Impo|sition of Hands? It's certain they seem to assume that Power when they say, <HI>Receive the Holy Ghost for the Office and Work of a Priest in the Church of God, now committed to thee, by the Imposition of our Hands.</HI> Is it the safest side, to solemnly promise at my <HI>Ordi|nation reverently to obey my Ordinary, that is, my Bi|shop</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> and to swear canonical Obedience to the <HI>Bishop,</HI> as you know has been commonly done? When I am taught to <HI>call no man Master, but Christ,</HI> Matth. xxiii. 8, 10. In a word, is it the safest side, to be ordain'd to but part of the Ministerial Work, and to be deprived of the Powers of <HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>Juris|diction,</HI> which belong to a Gospel-Minister as such, and which he must account for in the Day of Christ?</P>
<P>I cannot but think it the safest side, to seek <HI>Or|dination</HI> according to Christ's own Institution, and according to the Scripture-Pattern, where all these Abuses may be regulated.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> I desire you would remember, that your present Business is to prove, that the Powers of <HI>Or|dination</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> belong to Presbyters; and not to draw up a Remonstrance against our Church.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> I have been assigning some of the Rea|sons, why I esteem <HI>Presbyterian Ordination</HI> every way preferable to <HI>Ordination</HI> by <HI>Bishops.</HI> And tho' I highly value the Church of <HI>England</HI> as a Protestant Church, and have a just Veneration for the Learning and Piety of some of your <HI>Bishops;</HI> yet you must allow me modestly to give my Reasons, why I can|not
<PB N="10" REF="003528_0014_0FF858E6A027BC38">
conform to the legal Establishment, how hard so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ver these Reasons bear upon your Constitution. And I am now ready to answer your Demand, and to demonstrate to you, that those Powers you deny to <HI>Presbyters,</HI> are inherent in them by divine Institution. Which I shall prove,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> From the <HI>Identity</HI> of <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presby|ters,</HI></P>
<P>I am sure you will own, that if <HI>Presbyters</HI> are <HI>Bishops,</HI> they have power to ordain others; and have a right to the Government of the Church. And I think there is nothing more plainly laid down in than that they are of the same Order and Office.</P>
<P>This appears from Phil. i. 1. <HI>Paul and Timotheus the Servants of Jesus Christ, to all the Saints in Christ Jesus, which are at Philippi, with the BISHOPS and Deacons.</HI> From which Text, one of these two things is absolutely necessary, and submitted to your choice; either that there was a plurality of <HI>Bishops</HI> in a par|ticular Church, by divine Appointment, as we see there was in the Church of <HI>Philippi,</HI> and then there will be no room for a <HI>Diocesan,</HI> nor for <HI>Presbyters</HI> subordinate to <HI>Bishops:</HI> Or else that <HI>Presbyters</HI> are properly <HI>Bishops,</HI> and <HI>Bishops Presbyters,</HI> which a|mounts to the same thing; and was the thing to be proved. I would intreat you to consider, what sort of <HI>Diocesan Bishops</HI> these were, where there was a plurality in one City and Congregation; and no Presbyters under them. Were these like our pre|sent <HI>Bishops,</HI> who have so many hundred Congregati|ons under their Charge?</P>
<P>The same thing is also manifest from <HI>1 Tim. iii.</HI> Where the Apostle particularly describes the Duties, and necessary Qualifications of <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> without so much as mentioning <HI>Presbyters;</HI> or giv|ing any direction for their Conduct. And what can you imagine to be the reason of this? Was it be|cause <HI>Presbyters</HI> were not worthy the Apostle's notice, and because there were no Duties belonging to them?
<PB N="11" REF="003528_0015_0FF858E99D4AB7E0">
Or was it because they were the same Persons with the <HI>Bishops?</HI> Certainly either there were no <HI>Pres|byters</HI> at that time; and if so, there was but one Order of ordinary <HI>Ministers</HI> in the Church, and enough of that Order to serve the exigency of the several Congre|gations; &amp; they consequently not <HI>Diocesan</HI> but <HI>Congre|gational Bishops:</HI> or else <HI>Presbyters</HI> are the same with <HI>Bishops,</HI> &amp; mention'd under that general name; which comes to the same thing.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> The bare Omission of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> in the two places by you cited, appears but a weak founda|tion to build your Hypothesis upon.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> I have offer'd you my Arguments from the cited Scriptures, which you &amp; all your Party are incapa|ble to give a rational Answer to. But this is not the only foundation we build upon; we have many o|ther texts of Scripture, which give equal light to the same Case: particularly,&mdash;</P>
<P>The <HI>Identity</HI> of <HI>Bishop</HI> &amp; <HI>Presbyter</HI> does also appear in a meridian Light, from Tit.i. 5,6,7. <HI>For this cause left I thee at Crete, that thou should'st set in Order the things that are wanting, and ordain Elders</HI> (Presbyters) <HI>in every City&mdash;if any be blameless;&mdash;For a Bishop must be blame|less, as the Steward of God.</HI> The <HI>Apostle</HI> is here direct|ing <HI>Titus,</HI> in the qualifications necessary to the <HI>Presbyters</HI> he ordains, &amp; one of them is, that he be <HI>blameless.</HI> For which he gives this reason, <HI>a</HI> BISHOP <HI>must be blameless.</HI> Certainly then <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> were in his Sense one and the same. He would otherwise have said, <HI>For a</HI> PRESBYTER <HI>must be blameless,</HI> because he was speaking of the Ordination of <HI>Presbyters. Bishop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter</HI> must therefore be the same Order; or else the Apostle argues impertinently, and his reason has no force in it. What force could there be in such reasoning, Let the <HI>Presbyters</HI> you ordain be blameless; For a <HI>Bishop</HI> must be blameless: if <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Pres|byters</HI> were not the same? I think you dare not sup|pose the Apostle spake impertinently, and therefore must acknowledge what I plead for.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="003528_0016_0FF858EC967E6088">The same thing is likewise evident from Act. xx. 17,28. <HI>And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, &amp; called the Elders</HI> (Presbyters) <HI>of the Church, and said to them&mdash;Take heed therefore to your selves, and to the Flock over which the Holy Ghost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ath made you Overseers;</HI> or as it is in the Original, <HI>Bishops.</HI> Nothing can be more certain than that the same Persons are called <HI>Elders</HI> in the 17th, and <HI>Bishops</HI> in the 28th verse. From whence it appears, that there were a number of <HI>Bi|shops</HI> in the Apostles times set over one Congregati|on; and that those <HI>Bishops</HI> were but mere <HI>Presbyters<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> So little knowledge had they of <HI>Diocesans</HI> in that Age of the Church. It seems the Church of <HI>England</HI> were anciently aware of the force of this Argument; why else did they endeavour to hide it from the com|mon People, by using the word <HI>Overseer,</HI> in their translation of this Text, instead of <HI>Bishop?</HI> It looks at best something suspicious.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> It is allowed, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> are sometimes in the New Testament called <HI>Bishops:</HI> and there seems to be this reason for it, they have part of the <HI>Bishops</HI> Charge, and are so far Overseers or <HI>Bishops</HI> of their respective Cures; but we never find <HI>Bishops</HI> called <HI>Presbyters;</HI> and therefore you can't find so much as a community of Names, in Scripture.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> Don't you acknowledge the <HI>Apostles</HI> to be <HI>Bishops?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> I hope to make it evident to you, that in their ordinary Character they were properly and formally <HI>Diocesan Bishops.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> Have you forgot, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> call themselves <HI>Presbyters?</HI> Be pleased to read, 1 Pet.v.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>The Elders that are among you, I exhort, who am also an Elder</HI> (or Presbyter.) So ii. <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. and iii. <HI>Joh</HI> 1. Can any thing be plainer, than that according to your own Scheme, <HI>Bishops</HI> are in these Texts called <HI>Pres|byters?</HI> Indeed I am far from allowing your whim|sical Supposition, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> were <HI>Diocesan Bishops:</HI> but as I am sure that in their ordinary Capacity,
<PB N="13" REF="003528_0017_0FF858EEA9708D10">
they were the highest standing Officer in the Church, so that these Officers, consider'd in that capacity, were no more than <HI>Presbyters,</HI> if they themselves knew their own proper Denomination.</P>
<P>This brings into my mind another Question, to which I would also intreat your Answer: And that is, To whom does the <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of the Church belong?</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> There is no occasion for that Question. You know my Sentiments, that I esteem you a <HI>Schis|matick</HI> for refusing subjection to the <HI>Bishops,</HI> in whom the whole power of <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> is lodged.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> Sir, I did not ask the Question, because I was a Stranger to your Sentiments; but only to make way for the Conviction I propose to offer you, from 1 Tim. v. 17. <HI>Let the Elders that rule well, be count|ed worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in Word and Doctrine.</HI> From whence it appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. If <HI>Bishops</HI> are those that rule well, they are called <HI>Elders</HI> or <HI>Presbyters</HI> in Scripture, and what then be|comes of your Objection?</P>
<P N="2">2. It also appears from this Text, that either <HI>Pres|byters</HI> are <HI>Bishops,</HI> in that both <HI>Ruling</HI> and <HI>Labouring in Word and Doctrine</HI> are committed to them; Or else that they are superior to <HI>Bishops,</HI> in that they are <HI>more especially worthy of double <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">onour, who labour in Word and Doctrine,</HI> which you allow to be the <HI>Presbyters</HI> Province. Chuse you which part of the Disjunction you please.</P>
<P>Thus you see from the Scripture account of the mat|ter, that not only <HI>Presbyters</HI> were <HI>Bishops,</HI> but <HI>Bishops</HI> also were <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and if that don't prove them to be the same Order, I despair of ever seeing any thing proved.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> If all you plead for be granted, that there was a community of Names between <HI>Bishop</HI> &amp; <HI>Pres|byter,</HI> it do's not prove the Order the same. The Ge|neral of a Roman Army was formerly called <HI>Empe|ror:</HI> It won't therefore follow that he was the supreme
<PB N="14" REF="003528_0018_0FF858F10FCC6730">
Commander of the Roman Monarchy, because of the same denomination with him that was.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> Can you imagine that the Apostles pur|posely led us into a mistake in this matter, by the promiscuous use of the Names? Can you suppose the Pen-men of the sacred Pages so confused in their account of things, that they knew not how to distin|guish one Order from another, when they knew that these had distinct Powers, and ought to be distinguish|ed by all succeeding Ages of the Church: And that even the Validity of sacred Ordinances, and the Salvation of Souls, depended upon that distinction? Were they chargeable with writing unintelligibly, and using Words without any distinct <HI>Ideas?</HI> No, Sir, the plain truth of the Case is this; they knew no difference between <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter,</HI> they thought the Names equivalent, and used them accordingly.&mdash;And as to your Example of the word <HI>Emperor,</HI> it is nothing to the purpose. Though the word <HI>Empe|ror</HI> or Commander, was sometimes applied to a victo|rious General, and afterwards appropriated to the <HI>Mo|narch</HI> of the Roman Empire: yet after the Name was so appropriated, it was not used by any subordinate General. And there never was, nor could be, with|out the confusion of Language, a promiscuous use of <HI>Monarch</HI> and <HI>General,</HI> as we find there was of <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter.</HI>&mdash;But that you may be fully convinc'd that there is nothing in this Criticism; I'll also prove to you, that the whole <HI>Work,</HI> as well as the Name of <HI>Bishop,</HI> was committed to <HI>Presbyters.</HI></P>
<P>This appears with the most convincing Evidence, from 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> v. 2. where <HI>Presbyters</HI> are exhorted <HI>to feed the Flock of God which was among them, taking the oversight thereof</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">) <HI>acting the Bishop</HI> therein, as it is in the Original.&mdash;Now then it <HI>Pres|byters</HI> were to act the <HI>Bishop</HI> in the Flock, you must own they had the <HI>Bishops</HI> Office as well as Name, which was the thing to be proved.&mdash;And the same may also be proved from <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 28<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> where <HI>Pres|byters</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="003528_0019_0FF812E6753C0958">
are not only called <HI>Bishops,</HI> but have all the <HI>Bishops</HI> Charge committed to them.</P>
<P>And as the taking the Oversight of the Flock, or discharging the <HI>Bishop's</HI> Office in it, according to these Texts, gives to <HI>Presbyters</HI> the highest <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> in the Church: so is it likewise evident, that they were also vested with the power of <HI>Ordination,</HI> from 1 Tim. iv 14.&mdash;<HI>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by Prophecy, with the Laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> If the <HI>Presbytery</HI> did impose Hands upon <HI>Timothy,</HI> it was only in conjunction with St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who charges him to <HI>stir up the Gift of God that was in him by the putting on of his Hands,</HI> 2 Tim. i. 6.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> It is very probable that the Gift which <HI>Timothy</HI> received, by the Imposition of <HI>Paul's</HI> Hands, was the extraordinary miraculous Powers of the Holy Ghost, thus conferred upon the generality of Belie|vers, in the Apostolick times, by the laying on of the <HI>Apostles</HI> Hands. But if your Supposition be granted, that this Imposition of Hands was for <HI>Ordination,</HI> it will follow,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Apostle acted as an ordinary <HI>Presbyter</HI> at that <HI>Ordination</HI> For <HI>Timothy</HI> was ordained by a <HI>Presbytery,</HI> and consequently the Ordainers must be <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and must act as such. If St. <HI>Paul</HI> was a Member of that <HI>Presbytery,</HI> it was a Presbytery not|withstanding, and they performed that <HI>Ordination</HI> in the quality of a <HI>Presbytery:</HI> Here is therefore a standing Warrant for all future <HI>Presbyteries,</HI> to write after that Copy. And this further confirms what I observed before; that the <HI>Apostles</HI> in their ordinary Character, were but <HI>Presbyters.</HI> And</P>
<P N="2">2. It also follows, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> have the Power or <HI>Ordination.</HI> Or else what business had their Hands upon <HI>Timothy,</HI> in conferring an Order, that they had no Authority to communicate? But after all,</P>
<P N="3">3 If it be supposed, that the <HI>Apostle</HI> was superiour to the other <HI>Presbyters</HI> in this <HI>Ordination,</HI> he must
<PB N="16" REF="003528_0020_0FF858F641249658">
then act in his extraordinary Capacity. For in his or|dinary Capacity he was but a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> as we heard before. And what Argument can there be from the extraordinary Power of an <HI>Apostle,</HI> to an ordinary <HI>Bi|shop?</HI> So that turn which way you will, you can't weaken the Argument from this Text.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> Well, but you cannot find any Exam|ple in Scripture of Presbyters ordaining <HI>without a Superior.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> Yes, we find <HI>Paul</HI> &amp; <HI>Barnabas</HI> set apart to the exercise of their <HI>Ministry</HI> among the <HI>Gentiles, only</HI> by the Imposition of the Hands of a <HI>Presbytery,</HI> Act. xiii. 1, 2. Which is, I think, an unexceptionable evidence, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> may ordain <HI>without a Superior.</HI> Sure I am, here are the usual Acts and Rites of Ordination, <HI>Fasting, Prayer, and Imposition of Hands,</HI> perform'd by <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers;</HI> who were not Apostles, nor Diocesan Bishops: Neither indeed are pretended to have been such, by any of your Party, that I remem|ber, but even you your selves grant they were <HI>Pres|byters.</HI> And now I call to mind an Argument I have some where met with upon the Case before us to this purpose. <Q>Either this Ordination is a <HI>Precedent</HI> to us, or not. <HI>If not,</HI> how can we be sure that those of <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> or any other, be so? But <HI>if it be</HI> a Precedent, then Presbyters have Power to ordain;</Q> and that without the Presidency of any superior Officer. And hence Ordination by Presby|ters (without a Bishop, in your Sense) is valid and regular.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> I deny it was a Precedent: for these Tea|chers had a <HI>special</HI> and <HI>extraordinary Commission</HI> for this particular Ordination; <HI>The Holy Ghost saying to them, Separate unto me</HI> Barnabas &amp; Saul, <HI>for the Work</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> You know, there was something extraordi|nary almost ever attending the Administrations of those primitive Times; which nevertheless doth not hinder you from drawing many things then done into Example, and forming Arguments from them to justify your Princi|ples
<PB N="17" REF="003528_0021_0FF858F92FA68C20">
and Practices.&mdash;<HI>The Gist, Timothy</HI> receiv'd at his Ordination, was <HI>given him by Prophecy;</HI> and 'twas by the <HI>Inspiration</HI> of the Holy Ghost, that <HI>Paul</HI>gave him that Charge, <HI>Lay Hands suddenly on no Man.</HI> So that <HI>Timothy's</HI> Commission seems extraordinary, as much as that given to the Presbyters at <HI>Antioch.</HI> And yet you scruple not to plead him as an Example of Prelacy, and argue for Episcopal Ordination from the Apostolick Instructions to him about the Exercise of his ordaining Power. Hence then, unless you will give up your Arguments for Prelatical Orders, taken from the Epistles to <HI>Timothy;</HI> you must not wonder, if we are not willing to give up our Argument for Presby|terian Ordination, from the Example of the Presby|ters at <HI>Antioch,</HI> upon the account of their having a special and extraordinary Commission for what they did. Thus much we seem agreed in, That here is an express Commission to those Presbyters to ordain: And as to the objection of it's being an extraordinary one, I think, I have made it appear, this do's not at all weaken our Plea from it in defence of Presbyte|rian Ordination.</P>
<P>Certainly the separation of <HI>Barnabas</HI> &amp; <HI>Saul</HI> was as authentick, tho' done by Presbyters, &amp; as exemplary, as any Ordination by <HI>Timothy</HI> or <HI>Titus,</HI> your pretended Bishops: and how then can you any longer deny the Power of Presbyters to ordain? I pray you to re|mark it, We have here an Instance of Presbyters ordaining <HI>by the Authority of the Holy Ghost:</HI> and an Example so circumstanc'd, I think, must have the vir|tue of a divine Precept. So that if Scripture-Pattern be a Consideration of any weight with you, you must acknowledge, we have here a just Warrant for Ordi|nation by Presbyters.</P>
<P>But now let us briefly review<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> what has been said upon this Head.</P>
<P>If there were a plurality of <HI>Bishops</HI> in one Congrega|tion, as appears from <HI>Phil.</HI> i. 1. If there were no or|dinary Officers in the Churches planted by the <HI>Apostles,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="003528_0022_0FF858FAB489C0B8">
but <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Doacons;</HI> as appears from the same Text, as well as from 1 <HI>Tim</HI> iii. It necessarily fol|lows, that there were no <HI>Bishops</HI> but the <HI>Ministers</HI> of particular Congregations: Or, which is the same thing, the Apostolic <HI>Bishop</HI> was a <HI>Presbyter.</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>Presbyters</HI> were constantly called <HI>Bishops,</HI> and <HI>Bishops Presbyters,</HI> the Apostles knew no distinction between them; for it's certain they made none. And you'l therefore do well to inform me, whence this <HI>distinction</HI> came.</P>
<P>If the whole <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> is committed to <HI>Presby|ters,</HI> and the <HI>Ruler</HI> is less honourable than the <HI>Prea|cher,</HI> in the Apostle's account: If <HI>Ordination,</HI> as well as <HI>Jurisdiction,</HI> was in Apostolic times, in the hands of the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> as I have fully proved they were, my <HI>Lord</HI> the <HI>Bishop</HI> must found his superior Authori|ty upon something else than Scripture-Institution. In a word, what one thing is more plain in the New|Testament, to an unprejudic'd Eye, than the <HI>Identity</HI> of <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter?</HI></P>
<P>If it were possible to add light to a Cause, that al|ready appears as the Sun at noon-day, I might observe to you, that the word <HI>Bishop</HI> is never used in Scripture but in direct opposition to <HI>Prelacy:</HI> And that the word <HI>Presbyter,</HI> when appropriated to a <HI>Gospel-Mini|ster,</HI> is always used for the <HI>highest ordinary</HI> Officer in the Christian Church. Which renders me utterly in|capable to imagine, upon what Scripture-Authority the <HI>Bishops</HI> superiority can be founded. And if I look into all the Authors, that have ever written upon the Controversy, on your side of the Question, I am no|thing assisted in that Inquiry. There is no Argument, upon which any one of them pretends to found your <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> but that some or other of the same Party have subverted the Foundation, and proved the In|sufficiency of the Argument.</P>
<P>There never was greater confusion in the building of <HI>Babel,</HI> than there has been in digging of new Foundations for <HI>Prelacy:</HI> which gives a shrewd Sus|picion,
<PB N="19" REF="003528_0023_0FF858FCEBE3E6A0">
that it is not to be found in the <HI>Bible;</HI> other|wise there would be a better Agreement among the <HI>Patrons</HI> of that Cause, as to the true Scripture-Bottom, upon which it is to be erected.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> I hope yet to give you good <HI>Scripture|Evidence</HI> of the divine Right of <HI>Episcopacy.</HI> And you should hear what I have to say, before you are too peremptory in your Conclusions. But in the mean while, I am willing to hear your remaining Pleas and Reasons, which I intreat you to sum up as concisely as you can, since it grows late.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> I hope when you come to offer your <HI>Scrip|ture-Evidence,</HI> you will endeavour to produce a <HI>Com|mission</HI> for <HI>Bishops,</HI> distinct from that to <HI>Presbyters;</HI> and to prove by some Precept or Example in Scrip|ture, that their <HI>Ordination</HI> is also distinct It concerns you also to shew where the sole Power of <HI>Ordination</HI> is appropriated to <HI>Bishops;</HI> where <HI>Presbyters</HI> are ex|cluded from it; and where the different Qualificati|ons of <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> are to be found in the New Testament. All this must be clearly and evi|dently made out, in order to establish your Hypothesis. And yet I think there is nothing of all this to be found in the Bible. But it's fit you should be heard. I will therefore conclude what I have to say, by two or three Arguments more, briefly proposed.</P>
<P N="2">2. Then, they that have the <HI>principal</HI> and chief parts of the sacred <HI>Ministry</HI> committed to them, have also a claim to the <HI>inferior</HI> and subordinate parts of that <HI>Office.</HI></P>
<P>This is a way of Reasoning, that I think you must acknowledge the force of. It's not credible, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> should be trusted with the greater, more honourable and important Parts of the <HI>Ministry;</HI> and the lesser concerns of it be reserved for a <HI>superior Offi|cer.</HI> Now that <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Baptizing</HI> (which you all allow to <HI>Presbyters</HI>) are the principal and chief Parts of the <HI>Ministry,</HI> appears from the <HI>Commission,</HI> Matth. Xxviii<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 19. where these are the only <HI>Mini|sterial
<PB N="20" REF="003528_0024_0FF858FFF32CD098">
Duties</HI> expresly committed even to the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves. Whence it's evident, that either these are the greater parts of the <HI>ministerial Work,</HI> under which <HI>Ordaining, Governing the Church</HI> &amp;c. as less parts of a <HI>Minister's</HI> Work are included; or else these Duties of <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Baptizing</HI> are the less parts of a <HI>Minister's Work,</HI> under which the greater are included in the <HI>Commission.</HI> But I'm sure it's a gross Absurdity, to suppose the greater included in the less<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and therefore you must acknowledge, that the less is included in the greater: That is, that the <HI>Presbyters</HI> Offices of <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Baptizing</HI> are the princi|pal and superiour parts of the <HI>Ministry.</HI> Whence the Consequence forces it self upon you, that as these have the greater, they have also the less: as they have the principal and chief, they have also the subordi|nate Work of a <HI>Gospel-Minister</HI> committed unto them.</P>
<P>The same thing receives clearest Evidence from the forecited 1 Tim. v. 17. <HI>Let the Elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double Honour; especially they that labour in Word and Doctrine.</HI> If they that <HI>labour in Word and Doctrine</HI> are especially worthy of <HI>double Honour,</HI> more than they that <HI>rule well;</HI> then <HI>Labouring in Word and Doctrine</HI> is a Work superior to Ruling, and the principal part of the Ministry. Whence the same Consequence offers it self, that they that have the principal part of the Minister's Charge, ought also to have the subordinate and less principal parts of the Work; notwithstanding the claim of any <HI>superior Officer,</HI> or any pretence of a <HI>higher Order,</HI> to take it out of their Hands.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> I shall not spend the time, by particular Remarks upon this Argument. But shall wait with as much Patience as I can, to hear what you have yet to offer.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> It's certainly the safest way not to touch that, which must necessarily burn your Fingers. Cer|tain it is, that there can be no just Solution given to
<PB N="21" REF="003528_0025_0FF85901EFE450A0">
this Argument: it does, and will stand in full force against you, notwithstanding any evasions that can be made. But I'll take notice of your Caution, and not impose too much upon your Patience; but proceed to offer another Argument.</P>
<P N="3">3. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a <HI>Successor</HI> to any <HI>Office</HI> have <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Powers</HI> that did belong to him, to whom he succeeds in his Office; <HI>Presbyters</HI> must necessarily have all the <HI>or|dinary Powers</HI> committed to the <HI>Apostles:</HI> and conse|quently cannot want Authority for <HI>Ordination</HI> &amp; <HI>Ju|risdiction.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>Successors</HI> in an <HI>Office</HI> have a claim to all the parts of the <HI>Office,</HI> in which they succeed, can't be de|bated. None will question but <HI>King</HI> GEORGE the Second has all the Authority of his Father, by vertue of his Succession to him. And I constantly insist upon it, that either <HI>Presbyters</HI> are <HI>Successors</HI> in the <HI>Ministry</HI> committed to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> considered in their ordina|ry Capacity; or else they have no <HI>Scripture Door</HI> open, by which they can enter upon any Parts of the sacred <HI>Ministry.</HI> That the <HI>Apostles,</HI> as such, have no <HI>Successors,</HI> I readily grant; but as ordinary Ministers, they have a promise of Christ's Presence with them <HI>to the End of the World;</HI> which must ultimately be meant of their <HI>Successors.</HI> Now then I intreat you to tell me, how <HI>Presbyters</HI> come by their Authority, unless they are <HI>Successors</HI> to the ordinary Ministry of the <HI>Apostles.</HI> And be pleased also to tell me, if they are <HI>Successors</HI> to the <HI>Apostles</HI> in their ordinary Ministry, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> deprive them of any Part of their ordinary Charge.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> I shall have further Occasion to consider this Argument; and therefore I shall not take any present Notice of it.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> I then go on to argue&mdash;</P>
<P N="4">4. They that have the <HI>Keys of the Kingdom of Hea|ven</HI> committed to 'em, have the Powers of <HI>Ordination</HI> and Jurisdiction.</P>
<P>This Proposition is self-evident: For you all allow, that both <HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> are
<PB N="22" REF="003528_0026_0FF859040AD2FB18">
Exercises of the Power of the <HI>Keys:</HI> And that <HI>Presbyters</HI> have the Power of the <HI>Keys of the King|dom of Heaven</HI> committed to them, is what you your selves also do in effect allow. All grant them the <HI>Key</HI> of <HI>Doctrine:</HI> and who then can deny them the Key of <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction?</HI> Since Christ gave all the Keys together, <HI>Matth.</HI> xvi. 19. and <HI>Joh</HI> xx. 23. He did not give one Key to one, and both to another. He gives no single <HI>Key</HI> to any Person, but <HI>Keys;</HI> and so whatever these <HI>Keys</HI> serve for. Now <HI>what Christ has joyned together, man may not put asunder.</HI> But I see you grow weary; I'll therefore hasten to a Con|clusion, and only add,&mdash;</P>
<P N="5">5. They that are in <HI>Orders</HI> themselves, have accor|ding to the Apostolical Constitution, Authority to confer the same <HI>Orders</HI> upon others. And conse|quently <HI>Presbyters</HI> have Power to ordain others to the same <HI>Ministry,</HI> which they themselves have re|ceived.</P>
<P>This Argument is founded upon 2 Tim. ii. 2. <HI>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many Witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful Men, who shall be able to teach others also.</HI> If <HI>Timothy</HI> had Authority to commit the same Things, which he had received, to other faithful Men, why han't all others in the Ministry the same Authority? You remember that celebrated Maxim of <HI>Archbishop</HI> USHER'S, <HI>Ordinis est ordinare:</HI> He that is in Orders, has the Right and Power of giving Orders. And indeed it seems strange and inconsistent, in you, who allow even of Inferiors consecrating Superiors, to deny Presbyters a Right of ordaining their Equals! If <HI>Bishops</HI> among you can consecrate <HI>Archbishops,</HI> I pray, what shou'd forbid <HI>Presbyters</HI> ordaining Presbyters?</P>
<P>Thus I have given you some of the Reasons, why I think that the <HI>Ministry</HI> and <HI>Ordinances</HI> of the Gos|pel are not confined to <HI>England;</HI> and that there are no Scripture-Grounds for your unchurching all the Protestant World but your Selves, for want of <HI>Epis|copal

<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> Truly the Evening is so far spent, that there remains no Opportunity for me to reply to what you have offer'd, or to give you the Reasons of my diffe|rent Sentiments.

<HEAD>The SECOND CONFERENCE</HEAD>
<P><HI>PRaelaticus</HI> makes a second Visit to <HI>Eleutherius,</HI> according to Appointment; and after a short Salute, renews the Conversation they had begun the Evening before.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> You see, Sir, I am come according to our Agreement; and my Business is now to offer you the Reasons, why I think the Powers of <HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> are not committed to the <HI>Presbytery;</HI> and why they are to be esteemed <HI>Intruders</HI> into the sacred <HI>Ministry,</HI> that enter upon it without <HI>Episcopal Ordi|nation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> Sir, I heartily desire to take the right Path; and if I am erroneous, I'm not willing to be tenaci|ous: but will endeavour to keep my Mind open to Conviction, if you have so good Evidence against me, as you seem to suppose.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> You and I are agreed, that it's necessary to the Character of a <HI>Gospel Minister,</HI> that he have not only internal Qualifications for that Office, but that he be also regularly separated to the Exercise of his <HI>sacred Function,</HI> by those that Christ has autho|rized thus to set Men apart to this Work: And I don't yet despair of convincing you, if you will divest your self of Prejudice, that notwithstanding all your Yesterday's Reasoning, the supreme Government of the Church under Christ, and the sole Authority of setting Men apart to the Exercise of the <HI>Gospel-Mi|nistry,</HI> is lodged with the <HI>Bishops</HI> of the Church; and is what mere <HI>Presbyters</HI> have no Claim to, nor can intrude into without a daring <HI>Usurpation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="003528_0029_0FF8590C3483C960"><HI>Eleuth.</HI> I don't Know why you should suppose me prejudiced against <HI>Riches</HI> and <HI>Honour,</HI> or incurably prepossessed in favour of <HI>Poverty</HI> and <HI>Contempt.</HI> I have too sensible Impressions of Self-Love, to be willingly deaf to the calls of my Interest, and per|swasions of my Friends. Be pleased therefore to offer good <HI>Evidence</HI> of what you have proposed; and I shall become a ready Proselyte.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> It's abundantly evident, that the <HI>Commission,</HI> by which the <HI>Apostles</HI> were put upon the Exercise of their sacred Character, was limited to them and their <HI>Successors.</HI> And tho' it is confessed, that they had some <HI>extraordinary</HI> Gifts and Powers, and were ac|cordingly put upon various Services, that were <HI>extra|ordinary</HI> and temporary, which did expire with their Persons: Yet as the <HI>ordinary</HI> Authority and Power of the <HI>Aposiclic Office</HI> gave them a Superintendency over other Ministers of the Gospel, so their <HI>Successors</HI> in Office must of necessity be vested with the same su|perior Powers of <HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction.</HI> So far are <HI>Presbyters</HI> from succeeding to the <HI>Apostles</HI> (as you yesterday insinuated) that they can have no Being at all, but what is derived from that <HI>Order,</HI> who succeed to the superiour Powers of the <HI>Apostles.</HI> The sum of the matter is, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> in their <HI>ordinary</HI> Ca|pacity were superior to <HI>Presbyters;</HI> and therefore their proper <HI>Successors</HI> must be so too.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> What I found Occasion to say to this Point Yesterday, might (one would think) have saved you the trouble of this Argument; but since you see cause to insist upon it, you must have the Patience to hear two Objections against it, which render me incapable of Conviction by it. In the first Place. I must object against the <HI>Apostles</HI> having any <HI>Successors</HI> at all, in the <HI>Apostolic Office.</HI> And I hope to convince you before we have done, that the whole <HI>Office</HI> of an <HI>Apostle,</HI> was <HI>extraordinary</HI> and <HI>temporary.</HI> And then Secondly, I must observe to you, that tho' the same Persons were cloathed with the double Character of
<PB N="26" REF="003528_0030_0FF8590E99727338">
<HI>Apostles</HI> and of <HI>ordinary Ministers</HI> of the Gospel; I can't find that in their <HI>ordinary</HI> Capacity, they had any Su|perintendency over other <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel.</P>
<P>To return to the first of these. I object against the <HI>Apostles</HI> having any <HI>Successors</HI> in the <HI>Apostolic Office;</HI> but insist upon it that the whole <HI>Office</HI> of an <HI>Apostle</HI> was <HI>extraordinary</HI> and <HI>temporary.</HI> This appears,</P>
<P N="1">1 From their being appointed <HI>Witnesses</HI> of the Re|surrection of Christ.</P>
<P>It was necessary unto their successful dis|charge of their Mission among an infidel World, that they should be <HI>Eye Witnesses</HI> of that great Fact, upon which Christianity so much depended; that they should be able to assure those to whom they brought their new Doctrine, that Christ risen was <HI>what they had heard, what they had seen with their Eyes, what they had locked upon, and their Hands had handled,</HI> as 1 Joh. i. 1. Wherefore it was pro|posed as a necessary Qualification, when as <HI>Apostle</HI> was chosen in the place of <HI>Judas,</HI> that he shou'd be <HI>one that had companied with the eleven Apostles, all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among them; beginning from the Baptism of John, to the same day that he was taken up from them, in Order to his being a</HI> WITNESS <HI>with them of his Resurrection,</HI> Act. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 21, 22. And tho' the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> preached Christ to the dispersed Jews, immediately after his Conver|sion; yet he must be furnished for a WITNESS of Christ's Resurrection, by being <HI>caught up into the third Heavens,</HI> before he enters upon his Apostle|ship. This may be made evident by comparing 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 2. with <HI>Gal.</HI> i. 17, &amp; onward, and <HI>Act.</HI> xxii. 17, 18. By which last mentioned Text it appears, that the Trance there mentioned, wherein he saw Christ, and received his <HI>Mission</HI> to the <HI>Apostolate,</HI> was the same Time when he was <HI>caught up to Para|dise, and heard unspeakable Words.</HI> This is confirm|ed by an exact Agreement of the Chronology. To this I may add, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> were all sent forth
<PB N="27" REF="003528_0031_0FF8591189617D40">
as WITNESSES <HI>unto Christ, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> parts of the Earth,</HI> Act i. 8. And accordingly t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y ever insist upon this as a necessary part of their Character, <HI>Act.</HI> ii. 32. <HI>This Jesus hath God raised up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> whereof we all are</HI> WITNESSES. See also <HI>Act.</HI> v. 32. <HI>Chap.</HI> x. 39, 40, 41. and <HI>Chap</HI> xiii<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 31. and many other Places. Now then if you can. find any such <HI>Bishops,</HI> that have been Eye WITNESSES of Christ's Resurrection, or have at least been <HI>born out of due Time,</HI> as the A|postle <HI>Paul</HI> was, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Cor.</HI> xv 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> by having been <HI>caught up into Paradise,</HI> and seen Christ there; they would be so far proper <HI>Successors</HI> in the <HI>Apostolate:</HI> but this Qualification being wanting, they must want the very first essential Requisite to the <HI>Apostol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Office.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That the <HI>Apostles</HI> have no continued <HI>Successors</HI> in the <HI>Apostolic Office,</HI> appears also from this, that it was essential to their <HI>Apostl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ship,</HI> that they should be endued with supernatural and miraculous <HI>Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ts</HI> and <HI>Powers.</HI></P>
<P>I have already considered the <HI>Apostles</HI> as WIT|NESSES of the Resurrection of Christ. But no Man is bound to receive Conviction from one single Witness. <HI>At the mouth of two Witnesses, or at the mouth of three Witnesses, shall the matter be established,</HI> Deut. xix. 15. They must therefore have the <HI>Wit|ness</HI> of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> in his <HI>miraculous Operations,</HI> to confirm their <HI>Testimony;</HI> and to convey irresistible Evidence into the Minds of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Pagan</HI> World, who were too opposite to <HI>Christianity,</HI> to have believed the Facts or Doctrine preached by them, upon their bare word. Our blessed Lord therefore made that Promise to them; <HI>When the Com|forter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Fa|ther, he shall</HI> TESTIFY <HI>of me. And ye also shall hear</HI> WITNESS, <HI>because ye have been with me from the Be|ginning,</HI> Joh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> xv 26, 27.

their <HI>Apostolic Work,</HI> until they had this <HI>Witness</HI> to accompany them in it. <HI>And behold</HI> (says Christ to them) <HI>I send the promise of my Father upon you, but tarry ye in the City of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with Power from on high,</HI> Luk. xxiv. 49. And to the same purpose, Act. i. 4, 8. <HI>And being assembled toge|ther,</HI> he <HI>commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father; which, faith be, ye have heard of me&mdash;But ye shall re|ceive Power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye shall be</HI> WITNESSES <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">to me</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> This you see was an essential pre-requisite unto the <HI>Apostolic Work.</HI> And agreably, <HI>the Apostles with great Power</HI> (that is with miraculous Operations) <HI>gave</HI> WITNESS <HI>of the Resurrection of the Lord Jesus,</HI> Act. i. 33. And thus they appealed to this indubitable <HI>Evidence,</HI> Act.v.32. <HI>And we are his</HI> WITNESSES <HI>of these Things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</HI> And I must needs tell you, Sir, that it is but trifling to urge in this Case, that these mira|culous Qualifications belonged to the <HI>Apostles</HI> in their <HI>extraordinary Character.</HI> For I must again assert, that their whole Work, as <HI>Apostles,</HI> was <HI>extraordinary</HI> and <HI>temporary.</HI> For they were APOSTLES, or (accord|ing to the notation of the Word Apostle) they were SENT, among the Nations, on this very Account, That they might be WITNESSES of the Truth of Christianity, and of the Facts upon which it depend|ed. Whence it was necessary, that they should have these miraculous Gifts, to confirm their <HI>Testimony,</HI> and to make way for the reception of their Doctrine.</P>
<P>Now then, if you can shew me such <HI>Bishops,</HI> that have these <HI>miraculous</HI> Powers, that have the Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t of Languages, that can heal the Sick, raise the Dead, communicate the like <HI>extraordinary</HI> Powers to others, by laying on their Hands &amp;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> I will grant that they are so far proper <HI>Successors</HI> to the <HI>Apostles.</HI> But they have otherwise no pretence of Claim to this Succession.&mdash;

You'l be pleased to exercise your Patience a Minute longer, whilst I only add under this Head,</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>universal</HI> and unlimited <HI>Commission</HI> of the <HI>Apostles</HI> makes it ridiculous to talk of their being succeeded in that Office, by <HI>Diocesan Bishops,</HI> or any other fix'd Pastors of the Church.</P>
<P>As they were <HI>Apostles,</HI> they were <HI>sent</HI> among all Nati|ons, and (as I just now observed) 'twas on account of their being thus SENT, that they are called APOSTLES. And accordingly we find that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> did per|sonally inspect a very large Diocess; when he assures us, <HI>that from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum, he had fully preached the Gospel of Christ,</HI> Rom, xv. 19. Wherefore it is but a reasonable demand, that you shew me <HI>Diocesan Bishops,</HI> not only furnished with Gifts suitable for this <HI>Oecumenical Charge,</HI> whereby they can converse familiarly with all Nations in their own Language, and confirm their Mission by undoubted Miracles; but at the same time have an <HI>universal</HI> Charge, and yet be fix'd Pastors of a <HI>parti|cular</HI> Diocess. But I see you grow uneasy, and there|fore shall add no more upon this Head, till I have heard your Reply.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> I have some reason to be uneasy with the tediousness and prolixity of your Discourse; but tho' I don't think it needful particularly to answer all you have offered; yet I'll just throw two places of <HI>Scrip|ture</HI> in your way, which I think will prove such a Stumbling Block, as all your plausible Reasonings can't remove: and notwithstanding all Arguments you can offer to the contrary, will make it fully ap|pear, that there actually is, and always will be, a <HI>Succession</HI> in the <HI>Apostolate:</HI> The first is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cor xii 28. <HI>And God hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, se|condarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers, after that Mira|cles, then Gifts of Healing, Helps, Governments, Diver|sities of Tongues.</HI> The second is Eph. iv. 11, 12, 13<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>And he gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, &amp; some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the

<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> I would gladly obtain your Sentiments, as to the meaning of these Scriptures, that I may be more capable to consider them. Do you imagine that <HI>Miracles, Gifts of Healing,</HI> and <HI>Diversity of Tongues,</HI> spoken of in the first cited Text, are necessa|rily so <HI>set</HI> in the Church, as to continue always, thro' the succeeding Ages of it?</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> No, Sir, it's plain in Fact they are not, nor is there any Reason why they should These were Credentials necessary in the Infancy of Christianity, to convey full Evidence into the dark Minds of infidel Nations, who wanted these Testimonies from Heaven, to convince them of a strange and unknown Doctrine: But when the World became fully acquainted with the Doctrines of Christianity, and had sufficient Evi|dence of the Truth of it, these miraculous Gifts were not heedful, and therefore ceased.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> Do you suppose that <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Evan|ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ists,</HI> enumerated in the second Text you quoted, are continuing Orders in the Church?</P>
<P><HI>Praelat</HI> I dare not say they be. For we do not find any <HI>Ministers</HI> of Religion in the present Age, justly claiming a <HI>Prophetic</HI> Spirit. And as for <HI>Evangelists,</HI> they were a temporary Order of Men, adapted to the infant State of the Church, whose Business was to fol|low the <HI>Apostles,</HI> through the several Churches and Nations where they went, to build upon their Foun|dations<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and to settle the <HI>Ministry</HI> and <HI>Gospel Ordi|nances,</HI> among the newly converted Christians.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="003528_0035_0FF8591B00737E68"><HI>Eleuth.</HI> I would then fain know of you, how it ap|pears from these Texts of Scripture, that <HI>Apostles</HI> are permanently SET in the Church, and to continue till Christ come, when <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Evang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ists, Mira|cles, Gifts of Healing</HI> and <HI>Diversity of Tongues,</HI> are con|fessedly Temporary.

<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> I believe upon a Review you will find, that the Knot is already untied. If you'l only con|sider these various <HI>Offices,</HI> and various <HI>Gifts,</HI> as they were adapted to the several Ages and Circumstances of the Church, your Argument at once vanishes into nothing. God hath set in the Church,<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> first <HI>Apostles, secondarily Prophets,</HI> with their several miraculous <HI>Gifts;</HI> in the first State of the Church, when these <HI>Offices</HI> and <HI>Powers</HI> were wanting: and thirdly <HI>Tea|chers, Helps and Governments,</HI> for the Churches stand|ing Service.

<P><PB N="32" REF="003528_0036_0FF8591DEDA345F8"><HI>Praelat.</HI> If all you have said be true, and it be granted that the <HI>Apostles,</HI> as such, have not properly any <HI>Successors,</HI> our Cause yet stands good. What we plead for is, that our <HI>Bishops</HI> are <HI>Successors</HI> to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> as they were <HI>ordinary Ministers</HI> of the Gos|pel; and so are vested with those superiour Powers of <HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction,</HI> that were proper to the Apostles.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> This brings me to the Second Thing I pro|posed, and that is to show, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> as Or|dinary Ministers of the Gospel, had no <HI>Superin|tendency</HI> over <HI>Presbyters.</HI> This appears very plain to me, from these Considerations.</P>
<P N="1">1. I must again observe to you, what I put you in mind of Yesterday, that the <HI>Apostles,</HI> as ordinary Mini|sters of the Gospel, always style themselves <HI>Presby|ters,</HI> but never use any Superiour Denomination.</P>
<P>Thus in 1 Pet. v. 1. <HI>The Elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an Elder,</HI> or as it is in the Origi|nal, a <HI>fellow Presbyter.</HI> So 2.Joh.1. <HI>The Elder</HI> (or Presby|ter) <HI>unto the Elect Lady.</HI> And 3 Joh. 1. <HI>The Elder</HI> (or Presbyter) <HI>unto the well beloved Gaius.</HI> I believe your Party would not have wanted matter of Triumph, if they had found the <HI>Apostles</HI> intitling themselves <HI>Bishops</HI> or <HI>Superintendants.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> I observed to you before, that it is not just arguing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> from a <HI>Community of Names,</HI> to an <HI>Identity of Offices:</HI> for at that Rate, you may prove the <HI>Apostles</HI> to be no more than <HI>Deacons;</HI> in that (as every Body, acquainted with the original Text, must acknow|ledge) they are frequently called <HI>Deacons</HI> in Scrip|ture.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> I am sorry I am forced to consider the same Thing twice; but there is no answering your Argument without it. I have before taken Notice of this Objection, to which I shall only add, that all the Names given to the <HI>Officers</HI> in the Christian Church, may be consider'd either in a common, or an appropriate sense. Thus the Word <HI>Bishop</HI> signifies an <HI>Overseer,</HI> and is from its
<PB N="33" REF="003528_0037_0FF8592028547A68">
original Signification, as proper to a Steward of a great House, as to the <HI>Bishop of London.</HI> And thus <HI>Pres|byter</HI> signifies an <HI>old Man,</HI> and may with greatest Pro|priety be applied to any <HI>old Man</HI> Whatsoever. But both these Names are in the Gospel appropriated to a certain sort of Officer in the Christian Church; and when so appropriated, it is just arguing from the Name, to what is signified by that Name: otherwise we must suppose the Sacred Penmen to use words with|out any Signification; and such as could convey no certain <HI>Idea,</HI> to the mind of the Reader. To apply this to the present Case, The <HI>Apostles</HI> must in the Texts quoted by me, use the word <HI>Presbyter,</HI> either in the common, or appropriated sense of the Word. If the former, the first quoted Text runs thus, <HI>The Old Men which are among you, I exhort, who am a fellow old Man.</HI> Which sense of the Text I think you'l hardly plead for. And its certain from the following words, that it was not the <HI>Apostles</HI> meaning. He did not commit the <HI>Oversight</HI> of the Flock, to all the old Men among them. If the word was there used in the ap|propriated Sense, the <HI>Apostles</HI> certainly designed that the same <HI>Idea</HI> should be joined to the word <HI>Presby|ter,</HI> when applied to themselves, as did belong to that Word, when applied to other Officers of the Christian Church so denominated. That is, they designed to be accounted the same sort of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as other ordinary Gospel-<HI>Ministers</HI> were. But then as to the Instance you give of the Apostles calling themselves <HI>Deacons,</HI> You your self must own, that they used the word <HI>Deacon</HI> in the common, unappropriated Sense of that word, to signify any sort of <HI>Servant</HI> whatso|ever; and intended no more by it, than that they were <HI>Servants</HI> of Christ, and of the Churches; and so your Objection is nothing to the purpose.</P>
<P>But you know that we don't only depend upon a <HI>Community of Names.</HI> I proved to you yesterday, that all the <HI>Powers</HI> of the <HI>Apostles</HI> in their ordinary Character, are found with common <HI>Presbyters.</HI> I gave
<PB N="34" REF="003528_0038_0FF85922732097B0">
you undoubted Evidence, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> have both the <HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction,</HI> which is all you plead for as belonging to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and their imaginary Successors. And you should have first answered those Texts of Scripture, by me cited to that purpose; before you had advanced the Argu|ment I am considering.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> To save my self and you the time and trouble of a distinct Answer to this long Discourse, I'll take a short method to enervate your Argument; and to convince you not only of a mis-application of the Scriptures by you cited, but also of the confusion of your whole Scheme. In order to which, let us recur to the original <HI>Charter</HI> for the Gospel-Ministry, the <HI>Commission</HI> I mean, given by our blessed Lord to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and to such as should succeed them in their ordinary Character. This <HI>Commission</HI> we find, Matth. xxviii. 18, 19, 20. <HI>All Power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth: go ye therefore and disciple all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things, whatsoever I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even unto the End of the World.</HI> And in Joh. xx. 21, 22. <HI>As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you&mdash;Whose soever Sins ye remit, they are remitted; and whose soever Sins ye re|tain, they are retained.</HI> By this <HI>Commission,</HI> not only the first, but the sole Power of <HI>Discipline</HI> is commit|ted to the <HI>Apostles.</HI> It is to them the <HI>Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven</HI> are given.

that the <HI>Apostles</HI> in the Exercise of these Powers, are to be considered in their <HI>ordinary Capacity,</HI> in that these Powers are to continue in the <HI>Apostolic Suc|cession,</HI> to the End of the World: or else the <HI>Com|mission</HI> falls, and the Promise with it.

<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> I am willing, Sir, to give your Argument it's due weight; and would therefore willingly have you further explain the meaning of this <HI>Commission</HI> to me, by answering a few Questions.</P>

<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> All that are directly and immediately au|thorized by this <HI>Commission,</HI> undoubtedly have.</P>

<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> The very Supposal is ridiculous. But I don't understand the meaning of these Questions.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> My meaning is to put you upon a Refuta|tion of your own Argument. And I must observe to you, that it's impossible for any Man to answer these Questions consistently, without the utter de|struction of your Argument from the <HI>Commission.</HI> For it falls nothing short of <HI>Demonstration,</HI> that ei|ther Christ has instituted no <HI>Presbyters</HI> at all in the Church; or else that they have all the <HI>Powers</HI> that this <HI>Commission</HI> gives: unless you can be so chimerical as to suppose, the <HI>Apostles</HI> and their imaginary <HI>Successors</HI>

authorized by one Part of the <HI>Commission,</HI> and <HI>Pres|byters</HI> by the other. If <HI>Presbyters</HI> are not included in the <HI>Commission,</HI> whence have they their Existence?

<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> You triumph before the Victory. <HI>Pres|byters</HI> may indeed be said to be authorized by this <HI>Commission,</HI> inasmuch as the superiour <HI>Pastors</HI> have hereby Authority, to <HI>commit the Ministry to faithful Men, that they may teach others also:</HI> But they are not <HI>directly</HI> and <HI>immediately</HI> Authorized by it at all.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> Have <HI>Presbyters</HI> no <HI>Commission</HI> at all to their Office, no Authority from Christ for their sacred Employment? Whence then is their Original? Do they depend upon Man for their Creation? Have they nothing but an human Institution? Be pleased, Sir, to tell me how this <HI>Order</HI> came into the Church.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> It is by another <HI>Commission</HI> that <HI>Presbyters</HI> are directly invested with the Ministerial Character: The <HI>Commission,</HI> I mean, given to the <HI>Seventy Disci|ples,</HI> Luk. x. And as these were not called A|POSTLES; but were every way inferior to them: so

their <HI>Successors,</HI> the standing <HI>Presbyters,</HI> must always continue inferiour to those in the <HI>Apostolic Succession.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> I might in answer to this justly put you upon shewing from the Commission to the <HI>Twelve</HI> and <HI>Seventy,</HI> in what respect the <HI>Seventy</HI> were infe|riour to the <HI>Twelve.</HI> For if they were not inferiour at all, if they had the same <HI>Commission,</HI> and were sent upon the same Errand with the <HI>Twelve,</HI> you know the Fate of your Argument. But to shew wherein this distinction and inferiority lay, is I know a task too hard for you. It's what neither you, nor any of your Party can ever be able to do. And yet there needs not a Word more to be said upon this Subject, till that <HI>Difference</HI> and <HI>Distinction of Order,</HI> is clearly evidenced. But that you mayn't think your self neglected, I'll propose some other Difficul|ties, that I want to see fairly removed. And&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. If <HI>Presbyters</HI> are <HI>Successors</HI> to the <HI>Seventy,</HI> and authorized by the <HI>Commission</HI> given to them, they are prohibited receiving any Maintenance; but are to seek their daily Food at other Mens Tables, <HI>Luk.</HI> x. 4, 7.

<P N="2">2. That <HI>Presbyters</HI> have no Authority to <HI>Baptize</HI> or administer the <HI>Lord's-Supper.</HI> For there are no such Powers given them, by that supposed <HI>Com|mission.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That either the <HI>Seventy</HI> were superior to the <HI>Twelve,</HI> or had no Authority out of <HI>Judea.</HI> For the <HI>Twelve</HI> were expresly commanded, <HI>not to go into the Way of the Gentiles; nor enter into any City of the Samaritans,</HI> Mat. x. 5.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> The consequence therefore forces it self upon you, that either <HI>Presbyters</HI> are su|periour to <HI>Bishops;</HI> or else that there are no <HI>Presby|ters</HI> at all in the <HI>Gentile</HI> Churches: chuse which pleases you best.</P>
<P N="4">4. The worst of all is, that the <HI>Seventy</HI> were so far from being <HI>Presbyters</HI> in the <HI>Christian Church,</HI> that they were not so much as Members of it. For there

was then no <HI>Christian Church</HI> existing. Our Saviour himself, and all his Disciples, were Members of the <HI>Jewish Church;</HI> and actually submitted to all the Ordinances of it. But the <HI>Christian Church</HI> being founded upon his Resurrection, there could be no <HI>Ministers</HI> nor indeed <HI>Members</HI> of this Church, before it had a Being. The Apostle assures us, that the <HI>New Testament</HI> (and certainly then the new Dispensation therein revealed) depended upon the Death of the Testator, Heb ix 16, 17. <HI>For where a Testament is, there must of Necessity be the Death of the Testator.

There was then no <HI>Christian Church,</HI> they could not therefore be Officers in the Church, nor have any <HI>Successors.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> The time spends, and we have dwelt too long upon this Point already: I have other Argu|ments yet to offer, which you'l find harder Work to get over.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth</HI> If you please we will first consider where we are, and just take a brief summary View of what has occurred under this your first Argument; that we may find how the Case stands.</P>
<P>When you can find proper WITNESSES of Christ's Resurrection, to succeed the <HI>Apostles,</HI> such I mean as can attest that Fact, from their Personal Knowledge, either by conversing with our Lord Jesus Christ, after he rose from the Dead, or by being <HI>caught up i Paradise,</HI> that they might there see him: When you can find <HI>Successors</HI> to the <HI>Apostles</HI> endued with those miraculous Gifts, whereby the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> be|comes a joint <HI>Witness</HI> with them, both of the Facts and Doctrines which they publish: When you can reconcile the small difficulty of Men's being <HI>itinerant</HI>

Preachers thro' the whole World; and yet at the same time being <HI>settled</HI> and having their Charge li|mited to the Bounds of a particular <HI>Diocess;</HI> I will allow your <HI>Bishops</HI> to be the <HI>Apostles Successors.</HI></P>
<P>When you can make it appear that 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 28. and <HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 11. by you quoted, do by the same Words, make <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Offices</HI> both perpetual and temporary, to continue to the End of the World, and yet wholly cease with the first Ages of the Church; I will admit your Evidence for the <HI>perpetuity</HI> of the <HI>Apostolate.</HI></P>
<P>When, notwithstanding the Apostles themselves tell us, that in their ordinary Capacity they were <HI>Presbyters,</HI> you can make it appear, they were of a|nothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Order: When, notwithstanding the Powers of <HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> are found from Scrip|ture to be exercised by <HI>Presbyters,</HI> you can prove these to be the <HI>Bishops</HI> Prerogative, to belong to him exclusive of <HI>Presbyters;</HI> I will allow my <HI>Lord</HI> the <HI>Bishop</HI> his superiour Character.</P>
<P>When you can find, that the same <HI>Commission</HI> gives different Powers and Authorities: When you can find, that a temporary and occasional Mission of Men, that were not so much as Members, much less Mini|sters of the Christian Church, is the only <HI>Commission</HI> by which the <HI>ordinary Pastors</HI> of the Church exercise their <HI>Office;</HI> I'll allow, that these depend wholly upon the Breath of the <HI>Bishop,</HI> for their very Being.</P>
<P>I don't wonder to see you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o uneasy, at this Review of the Cause. For who can help but mourn at the Death of such a darling and favourite Argument, as this has always been to those of your Party? If you please, I'll now attend to what you would further offer.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> Nothing is more evident than that all the Ordinances of the Gospel were founded upon <HI>Jewish</HI> Rites and Institutions. These being originally of Divine Appointment, Christ was pleased to honour them, by giving them a new Sanction; and by bring|ing
<PB N="40" REF="003528_0044_0FF85931CCBEC970">
them into the Gospel Dispensation. Thus <HI>Bap|tism</HI> was taken from the <HI>Jewish Ablutions;</HI> and the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> graffed upon the <HI>Passover Festival.</HI> And why the <HI>Gospel Ministry</HI> is not conformed to the <HI>Jewish Priesthood,</HI> no Reason can be given. Certain it is, that this being a divine Contrivance, must be the best Form for Governing the Church, that can be devised. And I need not tell you, that this was a proper <HI>Prelacy;</HI> the <HI>high Priest</HI> being superiour to to the <HI>Priests,</HI> and they to the Levites, exactly a|greable to the constant Order in the Christian Church, of <HI>Bishops, Priests</HI> and <HI>Deacons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> This Argument, if it proves any thing, proves too much; and instead of <HI>Diocesan Episcopacy,</HI> sets up a <HI>Papacy.</HI> For as the <HI>high Priest</HI> in the <HI>Jew|ish</HI> Church was but one, so there should (according to this Plan) be but one <HI>Bishop,</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI> in the <HI>Christian</HI> Church. But waving that Consideration, I entreat you to hear me patiently, and I think I can give you full Demonstration, that the <HI>Jewish Priest|hood</HI> is not, cannot be, succeeded under the Gospel Dispensation.</P>
<P N="1">1. The whole of this Order was <HI>Typical,</HI> and had a special Reference unto the great <HI>high Priest</HI> of our Profession.</P>
<P>This the <HI>Apostle</HI> largely illustrates in his E|pistle to the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">brews,</HI> and particularly in the ninth Chapter. And this is also abundantly evident, from all the Ordinances of that Dispensation. The <HI>Ta|bernacle</HI> it self being <HI>a Figure for the Time present, in which were offered both Gifts and Sacrifices, that could not make him that did the Service perfect, as per|taining to the Conscience, which stood only in Meats and Drinks, and divers Washings, and carnal Ordinan|ces, imposed on them until <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Time of Reformation,</HI> Heb. ix. 9, 10. From which Text it's plain, that the carnal Ordinances of this Dispensation were Figures of Christ, and were to subsist no longer than until his Resurrection, here called the <HI>Time of Reforma|tion.</HI>

Upon which account, the Levitical Law is call|ed <HI>a Shadow of good Things to come,</HI> Heb. x. 1.&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. This <HI>Priesthood</HI> was instituted with a <HI>sole Refe|rence</HI> to the Service of the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> and <HI>Temple.</HI></P>
<P>In which respect our blessed Lord, the Antitype of this <HI>Priesthood,</HI> is called a <HI>Minister of the Sanctuary, and of the true Tabernacle, which the Lord pitched and not Man,</HI> Heb. viii. 2. And if we take a full view of all the Charge and Trust committed to the Tribe of <HI>Levi,</HI> of all the Service, and all the Ad|ministrations, to which they were designed, we shall find nothing, but what referred to the Service of the <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> during the more unsettled State of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and of the <HI>Temple</HI> after that was erected. Such a Reference most certainly had all their Sacri|fices and Oblations of every Kind; and all their Meats, and Drinks, and divers Washings, in which their whole Ministry consisted. Accordingly we find the <HI>Tabernacle must be first reered,</HI> and then <HI>Aaron and his Sons be brought to the Door of the Taberna|cle, and Sanctified, that they might minister unto God in the Priests Office,</HI> Exod. xl. 2, 12, 13. In like man|ner the whole Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> were given unto <HI>Aa|ron,</HI> that they might <HI>minister unto him, and might keep his Charge</HI> (i. e. do the Duties of the <HI>Priesthood</HI> as Servants to him) <HI>before the Tabernacle of the Congre|gation to do the Service of the Tabernacle,</HI> Numb. iii. 6, 7. and Chap. viii. 19.</P>
<P N="3">3. This <HI>Priesthood</HI> was confirmed to a <HI>particular Family.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>high Priest</HI> was to descend lineally in all their successive Generations, from the eldest Son of <HI>Aaron,</HI> the whole <HI>Priesthood</HI> from <HI>Aaron's</HI> Family; and all that gave attendance at the <HI>Altar,</HI> from the House of <HI>Levi.</HI> This whole sacred <HI>Order</HI> was what no stranger might intermmedle with, nor come nigh to, upon pain of Death. <HI>Numb.</HI> iii. 10.</P>
<P N="4">4. These <HI>Priests</HI> were <HI>not ordain'd</HI> to their Office.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="003528_0046_0FF85935AC7A17D8">They had indeed a typical and ceremonial Con|secration, with Unctions, Purifications and repeated Sacrifices, agreable to the Nature and Design of the Institution, <HI>Lev.</HI> viii But they not being (as <HI>Priests</HI>) publick and constant <HI>Preachers,</HI> they were not set apart to their Work by Imposition of Hands, as such <HI>Preachers</HI> were among the Jews.

<P>All these Things being put together, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t is plain to De|monstration, that the <HI>Gospel-Ministry</HI> did not, could not succeed to the <HI>Aaronical Priesthood.</HI> For what <HI>Succession</HI> could there be to a typical Institution, after it's completion in the Antitype? What Succession could there possibly be in the Service of the <HI>Taber|nacle</HI> and <HI>Temple,</HI> when the <HI>Temple</HI> of Christ's Body (unto which the Jewish <HI>Tabernacle</HI> and <HI>Temple</HI> did wholly allude) had been destroy'd, and raised again in three Days? How can that <HI>Priesthood</HI> that was limited to a particular <HI>Tribe</HI> and <HI>Family,</HI> be conti|nued or <HI>succeeded</HI> in all Nations, and in those Persons to whom it was so severely interdicted, at the origi|nal Institution? Or how can that <HI>Ministry</HI> set apart by <HI>Ordination</HI> with Imposition of Hands, be said to <HI>succeed</HI> to that <HI>Priesthood,</HI> whose Consecration was wholly with ceremonical and typical Rites?

Act. xx. 17, 28 <HI>And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the Elders of the Church,</HI> and said, <HI>Take heed therefore unto your selves, and to all the Flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you Bishops, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own Blood.</HI> I took some notice of this Text yes|terday, to prove from it the <HI>Identity</HI> of <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter.</HI> And I shall now further remark to you,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI> was at this time committed to the sole care of a <HI>Presbytery;</HI> their pre|tended
<PB N="46" REF="003528_0050_0FF8593FAD9D1FC0">
<HI>Bishop Timothy</HI> being present, as appears from <HI>verse</HI> 4.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the <HI>Apostle</HI> designed unto these <HI>Presbyters</HI> the future charge of this Flock, as appears from his Admonition to watch against the <HI>Wolves</HI> and Apostates, that should enter in among them after his Departure, in the 29, 30, and 31 verses.&mdash;And then,</P>
<P N="3">3. That this <HI>Apostle</HI> never did constitute <HI>Timothy Bishop</HI> of the <HI>Ephesians</HI> after this time; for this was the <HI>last</HI> time they ever <HI>saw his Face,</HI> verse 25. In a word, <HI>Timothy</HI> must be constituted <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> either before, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this Convention. <HI>Miletus,</HI> or not at all. If before, he was but a <HI>Presbyterian Bishop;</HI> for there was a number of other <HI>Bishops</HI> along with him, to guide and govern that Flock. If after, he came not in at the right Door; for the <HI>Apostle</HI> under infallible guidance and direction had left that Flock under another form of Government. The Consequence is therefore unavoidable, that he never was <HI>Diocesan Bishop</HI> of <HI>Ephesus</HI> at all.</P>
<P>I might add to this, that the first <HI>Epistle</HI> to <HI>Timothy,</HI> upon which you found his <HI>Episcopal</HI> Authority, was certainly writ before the Convention at <HI>Miletus:</HI> this is acknowledged by the most learned As|sertors of <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Hall,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hammond, Grotius, Lud. Capellus,</HI> Dr. <HI>Lighfoot</HI> &amp;c. And this I will prove to you, when you'll be at Leasure to hear the Evidence. And therefore its self-evident, that his <HI>Episcopacy</HI> at <HI>Ephesus</HI> is but a mere chime|rical imagination, since the Charge of that City is left in the Hands of a <HI>Presbytery,</HI> after his pretended Investiture in that See. But suppose, if you please, that this Epistle was written <HI>after</HI> that Convention; This imaginary <HI>Episcopal</HI> Authority must be the Sub|version of a Government, which Infinite Wisdom, that foresees all Events, and cannot be mistaken, had set up in that Church. For it was the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> that made the <HI>Presbyters Bishops</HI> of <HI>Ephesus. Timo|thy</HI>

<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> Bishop <HI>Pearson</HI> has proved, that St. <HI>Paul actually</HI> was at <HI>Ephesus</HI> after his Congress at <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">letus;</HI> and therefore afterward might find Reason to <HI>change</HI> the Government of that Church; and thus your Tro|phies are f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">llen at once.</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> Were that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ue, could the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> find reason to change? Did he alter his Mind, and invent a new and better form of Government, than he had before ordained? But I must inform you, that Mr. <HI>James Owen</HI> hath not only re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uted the Bishop, but brought the cause to Demonstration, that the <HI>Apostle</HI> spoke Truth, in saying, <HI>Now b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hold I know, that ye all among whom I have gone preaching the Kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</HI> And if you won't believe the <HI>Apostle</HI> in this his strong and positive Assertion, read Mr Owen's <HI>Tutamen Evan|gelicum</HI> Chap. iv. and be convinced. But I would add some other Answers to your Argument.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> were <HI>Evangelists,</HI> 2 Tim. iv. 5. And therefore if all the Powers you pretend to, were lodged in their single Persons, there is no ar|guing from those <HI>extraordinary</HI> and temporary Offi|cers, to <HI>ordinary Bishops.</HI> As these were <HI>extraordi|nary</HI> Officers, they wanted <HI>extraordinary</HI> Powers, for the discharge of their Trust.</P>
<P N="3">3. As these were <HI>Evangelists,</HI> they had all the Churches in their Care, and were to follow the <HI>Apostles</HI> up and down the World, to see to the set|tlement of the new Plantations. And that they were such <HI>Itinerants</HI> in fact, you'll be convinced by the following places of Scripture <HI>Rom.</HI> xvi. 21. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> lv. 17. and <HI>Chap.</HI> xvi. 10. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 19. <HI>Phil.</HI> ii. 19. <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l</HI> i. 1. 1 <HI>Thes</HI> i. 1. 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> i. 1. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 9, 12. <HI>Heb.</HI> xiii. 23. 2 <HI>Cor</HI> ii. 13. <HI>Chap.</HI> vii. 6. 7. <HI>Chap.</HI> viii. 16, 23. <HI>Chap.</HI> xii. 18. <HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 1, 3. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. x. <HI>Tit.</HI> iii. 12.

Collosse, Judea, Nicopolis, Dalmatia,</HI> and many other Cities and Countries, as of <HI>Ephesus</HI> and <HI>Crete:</HI> and therefore all Argument for a <HI>Diocesan Episco|pacy</HI> from such an extended &amp; universal Charge, must necessarily fall to the ground.</P>
<P>Thus then stands the evidence: <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> had just the same Powers committed to them, which belong to other <HI>Presbyters;</HI> therefore they are <HI>Dio|cesan Bishops.</HI> The <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> had set other <HI>Bishops</HI> over the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> &amp; given them the whole charge of that Church; therefore <HI>Timothy</HI> was <HI>Bishop</HI> of the <HI>Ephesians.</HI> The <HI>Apostle,</HI> or rather the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> had left that Church under the Government of a <HI>Presbytery</HI> the last time the <HI>Apostle</HI> saw their Faces; that <HI>Timothy's Epis|copacy</HI> must be a direct subversion of a divine Insti|tution: And yet <HI>Timothy</HI> must be the Governour of that Flock. <HI>Timothy</HI> &amp; <HI>Titus</HI> were <HI>Evangelists,</HI> and had the World for their Charge; and yet they were <HI>Bishops</HI> of a particular <HI>Diocess,</HI> and are succeeded by ordinary <HI>Diocesans.</HI> I presume you won't urge the <HI>Postscripts</HI> to these <HI>Epistles</HI> for proof of <HI>Timothy's E|piscopacy:</HI> for you know they are no part of the sa|cred Canon; they belong not to the Scriptures; but are confessedly spurious &amp; of a late Date. And what Argument is there then remaining for your help in this Case?&mdash;Why (Sir) so uneasy? I hope you'll sacrifice any Opinions of your own, to plain manifest Truth.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> I have two Arguments more to offer, and if you can give a good Answer to them, I'll yield the Cause. The first Argument I take from the <HI>Angels</HI> of the seven Churches of <HI>Asia,</HI> who appear to be proper <HI>Bishops</HI> of those Churches; and were accord|ingly accountable for, and charged particularly with, any Disorder or Corruption tolerated in their respec|tive Churches; and commended for suppressing and correcting these Disorders, and purging their Churches of heretical Teachers.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="003528_0053_0FF85945EA795250"><HI>Eleuth.</HI> Be pleased, Sir, to let me know, what Pow|ers are committed to these <HI>Angels,</HI> that don't belong even to a <HI>Presbyter</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> ac|cording to your own Constitution.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> This is a surprizing Question. Is not the <HI>Angel</HI> of the Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI> commended for <HI>trying false Apostles,</HI> Rev. ii. 2. ?

<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> As to your first Instance, not only <HI>Presby|ters,</HI> but even private Christians, have not only Au|thority, but are bound in Duty, <HI>not to believe every Spirit, but to try the Spirits whether they are of God, when false Prophets</HI> (or false Apostles) <HI>are gone out into the World.</HI> 1 Joh. iv. 1. So that there is no <HI>Epis|copal</HI> Power necessary, for the trial of <HI>false Apostles.</HI> And as to the other Instances, there's nothing like <HI>Excommunication</HI> mentioned in the quoted Texts. The <HI>Angels</HI> of those Churches are faulted for having and suffering those H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ticks, which necessarily im|plies no more, than that they entertained them, and did not bear due Testimony against them.

<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> Are <HI>Presbyters</HI> of our Church accountable for the Faults and Disorders of their Churches?</P>
<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> Most certainly, when these Faults and Disorders creep into the Churches, thro' their Care|lessness and Negligence, as might be the Case before us.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> It is impossible that these <HI>Angels</HI> should be mere <HI>Presbyters,</HI> in that there were too many <HI>Con|gregations</HI> in each of these Churches, to be the Charge

of such a <HI>Presbyter.</HI> This may be rationally conclud|ed by comparing the rest of those Churches, with that of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> where it seems absolutely necessary that there should be divers <HI>Congregations,</HI> under the Inspection of these <HI>Angels</HI> as their Presidents or Su|perintendents.

<P><HI>Eleuth.</HI> That there were a number of <HI>Elders</HI> in the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and that these were the proper <HI>Bishops</HI> of that Church, I have already argu'd, to the confusion of your Scheme.

<P N="1">1. Then, The whole of this <HI>Apocalyptical Vision</HI> was written in the style of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church. Hence we so often hear of the <HI>twelve Tribes of Israel,</HI> of the <HI>Altar, Incense, Temple, Tabernacle,</HI> &amp;c. Upon which it's a natural Conclusion, that if these <HI>Angels</HI> do sig|nify <HI>Officers</HI> in the Church, they must signify the same <HI>Officer</HI> as was so denominated in the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church: And that certainly was a <HI>Minister</HI> of a particular <HI>Congregation:</HI> The <HI>Minister</HI> of every <HI>Synagogue</HI> be|ing called by the Jews, <HI>Sheliach Tsibbor,</HI> the <HI>Angel</HI> of the Church. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lightfoot,</HI> Vol. 2 p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 133.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. These Epistles are written, not to the <HI>Angels only,</HI> but to the whole <HI>Churches;</HI> and therefore whatever Power or Authority is attributed to the <HI>An|gels,</HI> belonged to the whole <HI>Churches,</HI> and not to par|ticular Persons. Thus Rev. i. 4. <HI>John to the seven Churches that are in Asia.</HI> And thus in the Conclu|sion of every Epistle, <HI>He that hath an ear to hear,
<PB N="52" REF="003528_0056_0FF8594DADF2E8B0">
let him hear what the Spirit faith unto the Churches.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It's certain that the word <HI>Angel</HI> is often taken col|lectively for a Multitude: and so if it be here design|ed for the sacred <HI>Ministry</HI> in particular, it must imply the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> and not a single <HI>Bishop</HI> Thus, <HI>Psal.</HI> xxxiv. 7. <HI>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him.</HI> And in this Book of the <HI>Reve|lation,</HI> it is used for a Number of Gospel-<HI>Ministers.</HI> Chap. xiv 6. And <HI>I saw another Angel fly in the midst of Heaven, having the eve lasting Gospel</HI> &amp;c. That is (as Interpreters agree) he saw a Number of faithful <HI>Ministers,</HI> preaching the everlasting Gospel&mdash;And that the word <HI>Angel</HI> must be understood in these Epistles thus collectively, is undeniable from the fre|quent change of Number, in the Address to these <HI>An|gels,</HI> which can't be made sense of, if applied to a particular Person. Thus Chap. ii. 10 <HI>Fear none of these things which</HI> THOU <HI>shalt suffer, Behold the Devil shall cast some of</HI> YOU <HI>into Prison, that YE may be tried, and YE shall have Tribulation ten Days.</HI> So ver. 13. <HI>Antipas my faithful Martyr was stain</HI> AMONG YOU So like wise. ver. 24. <HI>Unto</HI> YOU <HI>I say, and to the rest in Thyatira.</HI> To which I may add, that it's hardly to be received, that the <HI>Bishops</HI> were charged with all those Sins, for which Christ threatens to remove their Candlesticks out of their Places: Or that God would punish a Church, by removing their Candle|stick for the Sin of a particular Person. In a word, the whole current style of these Epistles is incompatible to a single Person. And if you will have these <HI>An|gels</HI> single Persons, you must make it good sense, to call a <HI>Bishop</HI> a <HI>Church,</HI> to have a plurality of Persons in one <HI>Bishop,</HI> to have some of a <HI>Bishop</HI> cast into <HI>Prison,</HI> to have a <HI>Martyr</HI> slain among a <HI>Bishop</HI> &amp;c. But I think you'll hardly attempt to reconcile these forms of speech to the rules of Grammar.</P>
<P N="4">4 If after all I should allow these <HI>Angels</HI> to be single Persons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> why might they not as well be <HI>Moderators</HI> of the <HI>Presbyteries,</HI> as <HI>Diocesan Bishops?</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="003528_0057_0FF8594F341A0B10">
It's certain that there was a <HI>Presbytery</HI> in one of these Churches, to whom the whole Charge of the Flock was committed, as we have already consider'd from <HI>Act.</HI> xx. And its a just supposal, that all these Churches were under the same form of Government. Why <HI>Ephesus</HI> should be <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> and the rest <HI>Episcopa|lian,</HI> you can give no Reason. Now then, if the word <HI>Angel</HI> here imply no more than the <HI>Moderator</HI> of a <HI>Presbytery,</HI> and by him the whole <HI>Presbytery,</HI> as has been the Opinion of very great Men, both Ancient and Modern, what becomes of your Argu|ment for <HI>Prelacy</HI> from these <HI>Angels?</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole then, if these <HI>Angels</HI> have no Powers applied to them, but what are applicable even to <HI>Presbyters</HI> of the <HI>Church of England, Pre|lacy</HI> cannot be deduced from them. If these <HI>Angels</HI> according to the received style among the <HI>Jews</HI> sig|nify no more than the <HI>Minister</HI> of a single <HI>Congre|gation,</HI> they leave the <HI>Diocesan Bishop</HI> to shift for him|self. Or if the word <HI>Angel</HI> be in these Epistles used collectively, for the whole <HI>Church</HI> ( or at least for the whole <HI>Presbytery</HI> ) as it's very certain it is; a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> or <HI>Congregationalist</HI> can much better establish his Opinion upon these Epistles, than you can do. So that turn which way you will, <HI>Angels</HI> will not be Guardians to your cause.</P>
<P><HI>Praelat.</HI> But is it not a strong Presumption that you must be in a mistake, in your Interpreta|tion of these Scriptures in debate, that the an|cient <HI>Fathers</HI> of the Church who lived near the <HI>Apostles</HI> times, and were much more likely to un|derstand their meaning and to know what Govern|ment did in Fact subsist among them, do assure us, that <HI>Episcopacy</HI> was the established Order by divine Institution? And therefore <HI>inquire, I pray th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, of the former Ages; and prepare thy self to the search of their Fathers; for we are but of Yesterday, and know nothing.

The Presbyters were a co-ordinate Body with the Bishop, not subordinate to him. There was not any Power or Authority belonging to one exclusive of the rest. But in After Ages the Pres|byters of some Churches parted with their Liberty and Right, and agreed among themselves, that Ec|clesiastical Matters should be Managed by the Bi|shop wholly.
