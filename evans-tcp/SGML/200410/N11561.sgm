<L>Away with all thy foolish, trifling cares,</L>
<L>And to the winds give all thy empty fears;</L>
<L>Let us repair and urge brave Sylla on,</L>
<L>I long to see the sweet revenge begun.</L>
<L>As fortune is a fickle, sportive dame,</L>
<L>She may for us the victory proclaim,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="014611_0022_0F9433F37AC52698">
And with success our busy ploddings crown,</L>
<L>Though injured justice stern and solemn frown.</L>
<L>Then they shall smart for ev'ry bold offence,</L>
<L>Estates confiscated will pay th' expence;</L>
<L>On their lost fortunes we a while will plume</L>
<L>And strive to think there is no after doom.</L>
<STAGE>Ex. Om&mdash;s</STAGE>
<STAGE>As they pass off the stage the curtain draws up, and discovers to the audience a Lady nearly connected with one of the principal actors in the group, reclined in an adjoining alcove, who in mournful accents accosts them&mdash;thus&mdash;</STAGE>
<L>What painful scenes are hov'ring o'er the morn,</L>
<L>When spring again invigorates the lawn!</L>
<L>Instead of the gay landscape's beautious dies,</L>
<L>Must the stain'd field salute our weeping eyes,</L>
<L>Must the green turf, and all the mournful glades,</L>
<L>Drench'd in the stream, absorb their dewy heads,</L>
<L>Whilst the tall oak, and quiv'ring willow bends</L>
<L>To make a covert for their country's friends,</L>
<L>Deny'd a grave!&mdash;amid the hurrying scene</L>
<L>Of routed armies scouring o'er the plain.</L>
<L>Till British troops shall to Columbia yield,</L>
<L>And freedom's sons are Masters of the field;</L>
<L>Then o'er the purpl'd plain the victors tread</L>
<L>Among the slain to seek each patriot dead,</L>
<STAGE>(While Freedom weeps that merit could not save But conq'ring Hero's must enrich the Grave)</STAGE>
<L>An adamantine monument they rear</L>
<L>With this inscription&mdash;<HI>Virtue's sons lie here!</HI></L>
