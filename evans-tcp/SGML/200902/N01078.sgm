<P>THE Life which the Children of God are called to lead in this World, is a Life of <HI>Faith,</HI> and not of &s;en&s;e: for the &s;upporting and &s;trengthning of which Faith, he hath laid in great and exceeding precious Pro|mi&s;es, which they are to feed upon: and if they do not make a comfortable living on them, it is their own fault. Tho&s;e Promi&s;es have e|nough in them to fortify us with re&s;olution to pur&s;ue the harde&s;t Duties, and bear down all the Di&s;couragements that thru&s;t in our way to &s;top it up, and bring us to a &s;tand; and to give us light and con&s;olation in the darke&s;t hours

of &s;inking di&s;tre&s;s. If we could &s;o fix our Tru&s;t on God, and place our firm reliance on his power and veracity, <HI>we &s;hould be like Mount Zion that cannot be moved.</HI> And indeed there is &s;o much of Paradox in the&s;e Promi&s;es, that &s;en&s;e is blundred at them, and carnal rea&s;on is run a ground at the contemplation of them, and Faith only can make true <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of them.</P>
<P>Such a Promi&s;e is this now under our Con&s;i|deration, which not only do the Unbelieving World make a ridicule of, but the Godly them|&s;elves are &s;ometimes at a lo&s;s about it: Hence that puzzle which the P&s;almi&s;t was involved in, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 77. <HI>begin.</HI> and probably there are a great many things in Providence, which a Believer cannot at pre&s;ent &s;ee through, nor is able to re|concile until he comes into a better light, as our Saviour told him, <HI>Joh.</HI> 13.7. <HI>What I do now thou knowe&s;t not, but thou &s;halt know.</HI> Only in the mean while he believes in hope again&s;t hope, and &s;o comes to conquer the Temptation, and recovers his Tranquillity, as he did after much &s;trugling, by re&s;olving, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 73.24. <HI>Thou &s;halt guide me by Coun&s;el, and afterwards receive me to Glory.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not here tarry to enquire after the di|vers readings of the&s;e Words by <HI>Interpreters,</HI> or the different &s;en&s;e put on them by Expo&s;itors, but only take notice of them &s;o far as is needful for the right &s;tating of the Truth which is to be remarked from them in regard of the pre&s;ent

de&s;ign: For which two things may be ob|&s;erved.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Subject</HI> here &s;poken of; <HI>the Ju&s;t.</HI> Which Word is to be under&s;tood according to the tenour of the New Covenant; for, in a legal &s;en&s;e that is a great truth, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 7.20. <HI>There is not a ju&s;t man upon earth that doth good and &s;in|neth not.</HI> And in that re&s;pect, the Promi&s;e would be of a non-entity, and exclude every one of <HI>Adams</HI> race, from the Con&s;olation of it, and &s;o become in&s;ignificant, and have no manner of encouragement in it. But it gra&s;ps in it all that truly believe, and are accounted Righteous in Gods &s;ight, through the <HI>Imputation</HI> of Chri&s;ts Righteou&s;ne&s;s to them; and have received an inherent and inchoate <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> through the <HI>Sanctification of the Spirit.</HI> And in this &s;en&s;e it is very frequently to be under&s;tood in the word of God; and this is the man whom God reputes to be a <HI>Ju&s;t Man,</HI> and to whom this Promi&s;e doth belong.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Predicate,</HI> or the thing a&s;&s;erted con|cerning all &s;uch; for the Subject is declared in|definitely, and without limitation, amounts to an Univer&s;al: and that is, <HI>that there &s;hall no Evil happen to him.</HI> This is a thing very my&s;terious, and hardly comprehended by us. The Word, <HI>Evil,</HI> that is here u&s;ed, is u&s;ed to expre&s;s both the Evil of Sin, and the Evil of Puni&s;hment or Mi&s;ery: and &s;ome there are that here apply it to the one, &s;ome to the other, and &s;ome to both;
<PB N="4" REF="001286_0005_0FB22B01429D1140">
and probably both may be included in them; for the Words are general, <HI>No Evil &s;hall happen to them,</HI> which &s;eems to aim at the kinds of Evil: and if we under&s;tand it in either of there &s;en&s;es, there is difficulty in the a&s;&s;ignation of it to one as well as the other, in regard of the manner in which this Promi&s;e is accompli&s;hed: for it is certain that Godly men do here encounter both with Sin and Sorrow, and if we allow none for Godly but &s;uch as are clear of both, <HI>We mu&s;t condemn the whole Generation of the Ju&s;t.</HI> Nor are any free from the&s;e, till they come to the <HI>Spirits of Ju&s;t Men made Perfect.</HI> And the Word which we render, <HI>Happen;</HI> in one <HI>Conjugation</HI> &s;ignifies, <HI>to Lament,</HI> and in another, <HI>to Occur,</HI> and &s;ome would have it in the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That he &s;hall not be overwhelmed with any Evil: and that which we render no Evil, in the Original is <HI>all Evil:</HI> but every one that is acquainted with the Language knows, that nothing is more common, than to u&s;e this Word, di&s;tributively, for any: and I think that there can be no other, at lea&s;t no better &s;en&s;e put upon the&s;e Words, than this, <HI>viz.</HI> That he &s;hall meet with no &s;uch Evil in this World, as &s;hall prevent him, yea that &s;hall not eventually further him to the ob|taining of Eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. And this is the thing that remains to be made good, in the pro&s;ecution of this,</P>

<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> That a Godly Per&s;on &s;hall meet with no Evil in this Life, but what &s;hall turn to his great advantage in the i&s;&s;ue.</HEAD>
<P>That many general expre&s;&s;ions in the Word of God are to be under&s;tood with a limitation, cannot be denied by him that would not im|peach it of a contradiction: and yet the thing it &s;elf hath a certain and excellent Truth couch|ed in it; and &s;o it is here, and this may be made good in re&s;pect of the Evil of Sin, but that it is aliene from my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. I &s;hall therefore confine the following Di&s;cour&s;e to the Evil of <HI>Affliction.</HI></P>
<P>To make way for the clearing of the Doctrine, a few things may be offered Introductory.</P>
<P N="1">1. Good and Evil may come under a <HI>Phy&s;ical</HI> and a <HI>Moral</HI> Con&s;ideration. In the former &s;en&s;e, a thing may be &s;aid to be Good, when it is &s;uit|ed to the nature of Man, and adapted to his ra|tional cravings. And in this regard, that which hath &s;uch a nature put into it, as may afford to a Man the Support of his Life, the pre&s;ervation of his Health, the re&s;toring of him to his Health, the gratification of his natural Appetites, that is good: and on this account Evil is what&s;oever is contrary to this, and damnifies the Man in either of the&s;e: and this ari&s;eth from the agree|ablene&s;s
<PB N="6" REF="001286_0007_0FB22B04C5059560">
of the nature of the thing with the na|ture of Man for who&s;e u&s;e it was made; or from its di&s;agreeablene&s;s to it in all the&s;e: this therefore that good Man Prayed for, and ob|tained, 1 Chron. 4.10. <HI>Oh that thou woulde&s;t ble&s;s me indeed, and enlarge my coa&s;t, and that thine hand may be with me, and that thou woulde&s;t keep me from Evil, that it may not grieve me.</HI> In the latter &s;en&s;e, they are con&s;idered as they bear a re&s;pect to the Law of God, and are made helpful to us in our Serving of him as our la&s;t end; or on the other hand become hindrances to us in our faithful Obedience: On this account Sin is called Evil, and Chri&s;t Prayed that his Di&s;ci|ples might be kept from it, Joh. 17.15. <HI>That thou wilt keep them from the Evil.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. A thing may be &s;aid to be good Phy&s;ical|ly, and evil Morally; and contrarily, evil Phy|&s;ically, and good Morally: Thus all the things that are adapted for the comfort of the mans natural life are good, becau&s;e they an&s;wer the next end they were made for: But when the&s;e are abu&s;ed to the hurt of his Soul, they &s;o be|come evil to him in that regard. Whereas that which in the former re&s;pect is re&s;ented as evil, if it is made advantageous to the promoving of his Spiritual Welfare, is upon that account good to him; and for this we have &s;uch remarks made in the Word of God, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 69.22. <HI>Let their Table become a &s;nare before them: and that which &s;hould have been for their welfare, let it become a
<PB N="7" REF="001286_0008_0FB22B0645F94818">
trap.</HI> And Eccle&s;. 5.13. <HI>There is a &s;ore evil that I have &s;een under the Sun, Riches kept for the Owners thereof to their hurt.</HI> The&s;e things are good in them&s;elves, yet by mans mi&s;improvement of them, they become to him eventually evil, and do him the greate&s;t hurt, becau&s;e they undo his Soul. Whereas by a wi&s;e and gracious im|provement of &s;uch things as are the mo&s;t grie|vous to mens natural re&s;entments, they become to him &s;alubrious.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Good or Evil of a thing is con&s;idera|ble either ab&s;olutely, or as it bears re&s;pect of a <HI>Medium</HI> to an end. All things come under one of the&s;e two con&s;iderations, <HI>viz.</HI> either as they are an <HI>End,</HI> or as they are <HI>Media.</HI> Now a thing under the con&s;ideration of an end, hath ever the re&s;pect of good upon it; for good in the object is the motive of a rational Choice; and nothing can be made an end by a rea&s;onable Creature but under &s;uch an apprehen&s;ion: but it is not to be denied, but that a man may pro|po&s;e to him&s;elf an evil end, under an appear|ance of good to his blinded judgment; and that is when he propo&s;eth to him&s;elf that, in the at|tainment whereof he will not make him&s;elf happy, but mi&s;erable; and &s;uch are the too frequent de&s;igns of deluded men, <HI>who call evil good, and good evil.</HI> And this is, either when he propo&s;eth that to him&s;elf as his la&s;t end, which is but a &s;ubordinate one; and though in its place it might be good, yet by thus di&s;placing
<PB N="8" REF="001286_0009_0FB22B07E08B6BC0">
it, it becomes evil to him; as when a man makes his pre&s;ent outward accommodation his farthe&s;t de&s;ign; or when he hath no farther reach in what he doth, but to bring to pa&s;s a wicked purpo&s;e. But in the u&s;ing of a thing as a <HI>Medium,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing the end to be good, the <HI>Medium</HI> is then good; when it is both lawful, and hath a tendency in it to promove the thing &s;ought; and evil when it is either unlawful, or will ob&s;truct the de&s;ign for which it is u&s;ed: as when a man either &s;eeketh gain in an evil ca&s;e, or u&s;eth &s;uch means as will hinder and not further his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. That which is truly &s;erviceable to advance a mans la&s;t end, cannot in a Theological &s;en&s;e be called evil, but mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be good. There is a la&s;t end, &amp; there be &s;uch as are &s;ub|ordinate. The la&s;t end is the Glory of God, which the rea&s;onable Creature is, or ought to be bound for in all that he is concerned in; and there are &s;ubordinate ends, which men may lawfully pur&s;ue in their right order; a man may lawfully &s;eek his pre&s;ent comfort, and u&s;e the approved means for the obtainment of it, and that which &s;erves him herein is good in this regard: but if this hinders him in his pur&s;uit of his la&s;t end, it certainly becomes evil to him. But that which whether it helps the former or no, doth yet become in the i&s;&s;ue more &s;ervicea|ble to the latter, it ought not to be called Evil, but Good; and on this &s;core we have the P&s;al|mi&s;ts
<PB N="9" REF="001286_0010_0FB22B0C3B811FB0">
acknowledgment, P&s;al. 119.71. <HI>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e things being thus Premi&s;ed, it follows that we proceed to apply this matter to the truth that lies before us; and to explicate this, Let us ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That it is the Lot of the Children of God to &s;uffer Affliction in this Life.</HI> This is an experien|ced truth, and no other than what our Saviour hath warned us of, <HI>Joh.</HI> 16. <HI>ult. In this world you &s;hall have tribulation;</HI> and the Apo&s;tles taught this every where, <HI>Acts</HI> 14.22. <HI>That we mu&s;t through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God.</HI> And it is here to be remarked, that as the Life of the Godly is here a life of trouble, &s;o there are no temporary troubles which mankind are liable to, but the Godly may encounter the like, and that not only for kind, but all the temporary circum&s;tances of them, in&s;omuch as there is no room at all here left to di&s;tingui&s;h between the one and the other; this the wi&s;e man ob&s;erves, <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> 9.2. <HI>No man can know love or hatred by all that is before him, and there is one event to the good and bad, &amp;c.</HI> And all the difference is, that to the one they come full of the Cur&s;e, and are but the beginning of &s;orrows; whereas to the others they are exempted from the Cur&s;e, and have a Ble&s;&s;ing annexed to them, which is not to be gathered from the thing it &s;elf, but only from the effects, which, what it is, will be anon
<PB N="10" REF="001286_0011_0FB22B0DC947CF08">
con&s;idered. But this is known only to them|&s;elves, and is to be judged of by the fruits.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That God is the Author of all the Afflictions which the&s;e do &s;uffer.</HI> Some there be who &s;up|po&s;e, that when it is &s;aid that no evil &s;hall <HI>happen</HI> to the&s;e, it only intends, that nothing &s;hall befal them ca&s;ually, but every thing &s;hall be accord|ing to the All-wi&s;e <HI>Coun&s;el</HI> of God; which is indeed a truth in it &s;elf; but the Wicked as well as the Godly are herein concerned; and be&s;ides as to &s;econd cau&s;es there are contingencies in the&s;e things. But this is not all the meaning: and the word not only &s;ignifies to <HI>Happen,</HI> but al&s;o to <HI>Evene,</HI> or come to pa&s;s. And it is very certain that all events are according as they were fore-appointed, as he confe&s;&s;eth, <HI>Job</HI> 23.14. <HI>He performeth the thing that is appointed for me;</HI> and God a&s;&s;umes this to him&s;elf, and makes that challenge, <HI>Amos</HI> 3.6. <HI>Is there any Evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?</HI> And God, in his ordinary Providence, works, by In|&s;truments, and frequently by rational Agents, and &s;uch as are malicious as well as voluntary; neverthele&s;s they do what he hath &s;een good that it &s;hall be done; tho&s;e therefore are called <HI>his hand, P&s;al.</HI> 17.14. And it is our duty to look beyond &s;econd cau&s;es in all the troubles that we undergo in this world, or el&s;e we &s;hall never make a right and profitable improvement of them; hence that, P&s;al. 39.9. <HI>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, becau&s;e thou did&s;t it.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="11" REF="001286_0012_0FB22B0F45CC9A98">3. <HI>That God hath appointed the&s;e to Glory, not|with&s;tanding the Afflictions which they do at pre&s;ent &s;uffer.</HI> To this they were de&s;igned in his Eter|nal Coun&s;el, and this was &s;ecured to them in their Effectual Calling, which is one of tho&s;e <HI>Gifts of God which are without Repentance.</HI> If then God had not in his purpo&s;e re&s;olved to bring them to Glory, he would never have called them, but left them in their Unregeneracy, &s;o that let their trials be never &s;o many or great, it is no evidence, as &s;ome are ready in their dark hours to &s;u&s;pect, that he either never Loved them, or that he hath forgotten to be gracious. We are therefore to con&s;ider what he hath cal|led them to, <HI>viz. to Eternal Glory,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.10. And this is an undeniable evidence that they can meet with nothing, though never &s;o &s;evere, that &s;hall ob&s;truct their Salvation, by &s;eparating of them from the love of God, which hath enter|tained them: and of this the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks with the greate&s;t confidence, in, Rom. 8.38, 39. <HI>I am per&s;waded that neither Death nor Life,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That God &s;ends the&s;e Afflictions to prepare them for, and to bring them to this Glory.</HI> He is an In|finitely Wi&s;e Agent, and mu&s;t have &s;ome Wor|thy de&s;ign in all his Works, P&s;al. 104.24. <HI>In Wi&s;dom ha&s;t thou made them all.</HI> Now if Gods end in regard of the&s;e, be to Glorify him&s;elf in advancing of them unto Glory, all his di&s;pen&s;a|tions to them are in Wi&s;dom accommodated to bring this about. There is a great deal needful
<PB N="12" REF="001286_0013_0FB22B10D2FBD148">
to fit them for the Kingdom, and conduct them &s;afe to it: and the whole way of God towards them in his Providence is to lead them thither. This was Chri&s;ts bu&s;ine&s;s, Heb. 2.10. <HI>To bring many Sons to Glory:</HI> and their whole conduct is to accompli&s;h this, P&s;al. 73.24. <HI>Thou &s;halt guide me by Coun&s;el, and afterward &s;halt receive me to Glory.</HI> And on this account we are told, P&s;al. 25.10. <HI>All the paths of the Lord are Mercy and Truth.</HI> Now Afflictions belong to this conduct, and are no little part of it. And if it be asked, Why doth God &s;o Afflict his own? The an&s;wer is ready, I&s;a. 27.9. <HI>By this &s;hall the iniquity of Jacob, be purged, and all the fruit &s;hall be to take away Sin.</HI> And on this account we are told that they ne|ver come but when there is need of them, 1 Pet. 1.6. <HI>Ye are, if need be in heavine&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. And there is not one Affliction that a Believer meets with, but hath an Eye to this, for <HI>God Afflicts not wil|lingly.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>As God u&s;eth the&s;e Media for, &s;o he will cer|tainly over-rule them to the promoving of this de&s;ign. The Coun&s;el of the Lord &s;hall &s;tand,</HI> neither &s;hall any thing defeat it: with this he comforts his People when the blacke&s;t Providences pa&s;&s;ed over them, Jer. 29.11. <HI>I know mine own thoughts, even thoughts of good will, and not evil, and to give an expected end.</HI> And hath he &s;aid it, and &s;hall he not do it? In&s;truments may intend hurt by what they do, but he will turn it to good; and every gracious Soul &s;hall find it in the i&s;&s;ue,
<PB N="13" REF="001286_0014_0FB22B12471AB1F0">
and may allot upon it as he, Job 22.10. <HI>When I am tryed, I &s;hall come forth as Gold.</HI> He therefore always Sits by the Furnace, and looks carefully after it; and by a powerful Influence gives it its kindly operation. The Apo&s;tle could com|fort him&s;elf in this, 2 Cor. 4.17. <HI>Our light Afflicti|on, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding, and eternal weight of Glory.</HI> And every Affliction belongs to the&s;e <HI>all things which &s;hall work together for the Good of Gods called,</HI> Rom. 8.28. And neither Satans Malice, nor wicked Mens rage &s;hall be able to hinder it, but it &s;hall be &s;o in the event, Eccl. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.12. <HI>I know it &s;hall be well with tho&s;e that fear God, that fear before him.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>There is no Affliction that over-takes a Child of God, but what proceeds from his Love.</HI> We a&s;|cribe Love to God, &s;ometimes on the account of his <HI>Beneficence,</HI> and this is common to Good and Evil, Math. 5.45. <HI>He maketh his Sun to &s;hine on the Evil, and the Good, and cau&s;eth his rain to fall on the Ju&s;t and the Unju&s;t.</HI> Sometimes to his <HI>Benevolence,</HI> or purpo&s;e of everla&s;ting good to them; and this is peculiar to Some, and every true Believer hath an intere&s;t in this Love: yea this is it that Governs all the Providences that pa&s;s over them. Is it Love that moves him to afflict them, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.6. <HI>Whom the Lord Loveth he cha&s;teneth.</HI> It is Love that pre&s;ides in the Affliction it &s;elf, as to kind, degree, and continuance. It is not be|cau&s;e God hates them that he Afflicts them, nor

it is apt to make impre&s;&s;ion on our &s;en&s;es, yet it ought not to impede our Faith and Con&s;ola|tion: for, not only did infinite Wi&s;dom &s;o or|der it, but the thing it &s;elf doth not put any real <HI>Obex</HI> to our Faith in the Promi&s;e, which we are to Live upon.

<HEAD>Preface,</HEAD>
<P>TIS the Lot of GOD'S Chil|dren while in this World, to meet with Troubles more or le&s;s. And through the remaining Naughtine&s;s of their Hearts, they are too prone to Murmur and Repine under them. Therefore Con&s;iderations to Sup|pre&s;s Murmuring, and Quicken Patience, &s;hould never be reckon'd un&s;ea&s;onable; and e&s;pecially when &s;ome &s;ore Tryal is actually upon them. And indeed it was a &s;ore Trial, which Occa|&s;ion'd this SERMON. I had thoughts of another Subject for the <HI>Lecture</HI> (as it fell to me in Cour&s;e) but a few dayes before the <HI>Lecture</HI> came; I was Surpriz'd with the Sorrowful News, of a <HI>Barbarous Mur|der committed upon Mr.</HI> Simeon Stoddard; <HI>Merchant, in</HI> London: <HI>A Per&s;on of an un|blemi&s;h'd Character, and of great Note for his Early and Steady Piety:</HI> Son to <HI>Simeon Stoddard E&s;qr.</HI> in <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> A more full

account of this Barbarous Murder, may be &s;een in the <HI>Bo&s;ton News-Letter, Numb. 127.</HI> Twas this Sorrowful News, that turn'd my thoughts to the Text before us: Hoping that a Di&s;cour&s;e upon it, might be U&s;efull to all that might hear it, e&s;pecially to the <HI>Mourn|full Parents,</HI> and other <HI>Relations,</HI> of the Worthy Per&s;on thus awfully Removed. And as this <HI>SERMON</HI> was Preached, more particularly for their Sakes; &s;o at the de&s;ire of the <HI>Honoured and Bereaved Father,</HI> it is now Printed.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>DIVINE <HI>Sovereignty</HI> ought to be acknowledg'd and ador'd, even in all tho&s;e <HI>Afflictive Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence,</HI> which at any time we meet with. Quarrelling with God, is unbecoming for any Creatures, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who call them&s;elves his <HI>Subjects, Servants,</HI> and
<PB N="2" REF="001286_0034_0FB2778D44470050">
<HI>Children.</HI> If God is plea&s;ed to lay his Hand hea|vy upon us, we ought quietly and patiently to Submit. Our Text informs us, That holy <HI>Aaron</HI> did &s;o, under a very &s;ore Affliction. God had cho&s;en <HI>Aaron</HI> and his <HI>Sons</HI> to the <HI>Prie&s;ts Office,</HI> and order'd them to be imploy'd therein. His two Sons <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abihu,</HI> acted contrary to the rules given by God, in &s;ome of their <HI>Official Per|formances.</HI> They offered <HI>Strange Fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not,</HI> ver&s;e 1. Tis thought, that when they burnt <HI>Incen&s;e,</HI> they did not take <HI>Fire from Gods Altar,</HI> as they &s;hould have done, but took <HI>common Fire</HI> for &s;uch holy Ser|vice. But whatever the particular error was, God was highly provoked with it, and bore &s;e|vere Te&s;timony again&s;t it; for the Slew them both immediately. <HI>There went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they dyed before the Lord,</HI> ver&s;e 2. Some think 'twas <HI>Lightning</HI> de|&s;troy'd them, but whether &s;o or not, yet tis cer|tain; <HI>God &s;ent a Fire which kill'd them.</HI> A couple of <HI>Promi&s;ing Young Men, Young Mini&s;ters,</HI> in their Health, Strength and Vigour; were thus <HI>Sud|denly Smitten,</HI> yea kill'd by the Immediate Hand of God. Nay &s;ome think, that the&s;e two Per|&s;ons had <HI>Drank too much,</HI> which occa&s;ion'd that error for which they died. Becau&s;e God pre|&s;ently gives a charge, That neither <HI>Aaron nor his Sons &s;hould drink Wine, or &s;trong Drink when they went into the Tabernacle, le&s;t they dye: &mdash; And that they might put a difference between holy and unholy,
<PB N="3" REF="001286_0035_0FB277901DAFA3D0">
and between unclean and clean,</HI> ver&s;e 8, 9, 10. And if <HI>Drunkenne&s;s</HI> occa&s;ion'd that error in the&s;e Young Men, which procur'd their awfull and &s;udden Death; then &s;urely their <HI>Death,</HI> mu&s;t needs be a more <HI>Aggravated Affliction</HI> to their Pious <HI>Father.</HI> Verily the Death of two &s;uch Young Men at once, and that in &s;uch an awfull tremendous manner; mu&s;t needs be a very &s;ore tryal, a very grievous Affliction to holy <HI>Aaron.</HI> Well, and how does <HI>Aaron</HI> behave him&s;elf under this &s;ore tryal? What, does he fall a vexing and fretting, does he murmur and repine again&s;t God? No, nothing of &s;uch a carriage, but the quite con|trary. Our Text tells us, <HI>He held his Peace.</HI> That is, he did not &s;peak one murmuring di&s;content|ed Word, he did not blame Divine Providence; but patiently bore God's Hand, meekly and qui|etly &s;ubmitted to his holy Sovereign Plea&s;ure, in this heavy and &s;ore Affliction. And <HI>Aaron</HI>'s car|riage herein, is fit to be Imitated by all Chri&s;ti|ans, under their &s;ore tryals. Yea <HI>Aaron</HI>'s hum|ble patient carriage herein is upon <HI>Divine Record, for our Imitation.</HI> For <HI>What&s;oever things were Writ|ten aforetime, were Written for our Learning,</HI> Rom. 15.4. From the Words therefore, we may Ob|&s;erve this,</P>

<HEAD><HI>DOCT. Namely,</HI> That Chri&s;tians &s;hould quietly Submit to the Holy Sovereign Will of GOD, under all the &s;ore Afflictions they ever meet with.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001286_0036_0FB2779C195D4940">Two PROPOSITIONS are contain'd in this DOCTRINE. [I.] <HI>That Chri&s;tians do &s;ome|times meet with &s;ore Afflictions.</HI> [II.] <HI>They &s;hould quietly Submit to the Holy Sovereign Will of GOD, under all of them.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>Chri&s;tians do &s;ometimes meet with &s;ore Afflictions.</HI> Much need not be &s;aid to prove this Truth, &s;ince undeniable experience renders it &s;o evident, and that in all Ages. The infalli|ble Word of God al&s;o informs us; that <HI>Many are the Afflictions of the Righteous,</HI> P&s;al. 34.19. Tis <HI>thro' much Tribulation, we mu&s;t enter into the Kingdom of God,</HI> Act. 14.22. <HI>Yea and all that will live Godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hall &s;uffer Per&s;ecution,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.12. Chri&s;tians mu&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure be <HI>Conformed to their Head,</HI> the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS. He was a <HI>Man of Sorrows,</HI> and acquainted with grief. He <HI>Fir&s;t Suffered,</HI> and then went into his Glory. He <HI>Fir&s;t endured the Cro&s;s,</HI> de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame; and after|wards &s;at down, on the right hand of the Ma|je&s;ty on high. Chri&s;tians mu&s;t <HI>Suffer, before they Reign.</HI> But I need &s;ay no more at pre&s;ent, to evidence the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition, viz. <HI>That Chri&s;tians &s;ometimes meet with &s;ore Afflictions:</HI> but may proceed to the,</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>They &s;hould quietly Submit to the Holy Sovereign Will of GOD, under all of them.</HI> They &s;hould by no means quarrel with their Maker; nor contend with the Supream Sovereign Owner,
<PB N="5" REF="001286_0037_0FB2779E3912CF30">
and Governour of all things. They &s;hould not fooli&s;hly tax, tho&s;e depths of Providence which they cannot fathom. But in&s;tead of this, they &s;hould quietly Submit, lye at God's Foot, adore his Sovereignty, humbly Ju&s;tify him in all his Proceedings; Patiently bearing whatever tryal he's plea&s;ed to exerci&s;e them withal.</P>
<P>Here we might Inquire,</P>
<Q><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> What are tho&s;e Con&s;iderations which &s;hould move Chri&s;tians, thus quietly to Submit to the Holy Sovereign Will of GOD, under all their &s;ore Af|flictions?</Q>
<P>For An&s;wer, There are &s;everal Con&s;iderations, which &s;hould move them hereunto. I &s;hall men|tion &s;ome of them, As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>All our Afflictions are brought upon us, by God's Providence.</HI> Indeed <HI>Sin</HI> is the <HI>Meritorious</HI> pro|curing cau&s;e, of <HI>all Afflictions.</HI> Men are brought <HI>Low,</HI> for their <HI>Iniquity,</HI> P&s;al. 106.43. <HI>Your Sins have with-holden good things from you,</HI> Jer. 5.25. Yet God's <HI>Providence,</HI> is the Supream <HI>Efficient</HI> cau&s;e of all our Troubles: <HI>Amos</HI> 3.6. <HI>Is there any evil</HI> (that is, Affliction) <HI>in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?</HI> No, there's none. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 45.7. <HI>I form the light, I create darkne&s;s; I make Peace, I create Evil; I the Lord do all the&s;e things.</HI> By <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Evil,</HI> we are to under&s;tand <HI>Afflictions;</HI> and they are of <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Creating.</HI> They ri&s;e not out of the du&s;t, but are &s;ent by him who dwells in
<PB N="6" REF="001286_0038_0FB2779F4C368E70">
Heaven. If we meet with <HI>Sickne&s;s,</HI> tis of God's &s;ending: He <HI>Wounds</HI> and <HI>Heals</HI> as he plea&s;eth. If we are <HI>Di&s;appointed</HI> in our Undertakings; this al&s;o is of God. <HI>Tis of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, that People labour in the very fire, and weary them&s;elves for very Vanity,</HI> Hab. 2.13. Tis through God's bla&s;t, that men <HI>Earn Wages,</HI> to put into <HI>Bags with holes.</HI> If Death &s;natches away our deare&s;t Relations; Death is but God's Me&s;&s;enger in &s;o doing: for <HI>our Times are in Gods Hand,</HI> P&s;al. 31.15. Yea if the Spite and Malice of Wicked Men and De|vils, are never &s;o plainly In&s;trumental, in bringing <HI>Afflictions</HI> upon us; yet we &s;hould look on God's Providence, as the Supream Governing Efficient cau&s;e of tho&s;e Afflictions. The <HI>Devil</HI> could not be a <HI>Lying Spirit in the Mouths of Ahab</HI>'s <HI>Prophets;</HI> nor hurt <HI>Job</HI> in his <HI>Per&s;on</HI> or <HI>E&s;tate;</HI> nor <HI>Sift Peter with helli&s;h Temptations;</HI> nor &s;o much as <HI>hurt an herd of Swine,</HI> without Divine Permi&s;&s;ion. <HI>Satan</HI> can no more, nor longer, mole&s;t us; than God &s;ees meet to permit him. Though he's a <HI>Roaring Ly|on,</HI> yet he's <HI>in Chains.</HI> So <HI>Men</HI> can do us no more harm, than what God is pleas'd to permit of. Even in the mi&s;chiefs which they wickedly do to us, they are but In&s;truments of a Spotle&s;s Di|vine Providence. Though <HI>Sabeans</HI> and <HI>Chaldeans</HI> had robbed <HI>Job;</HI> yet <HI>Job</HI> &s;ayes, Chap. 1. v. 21. <HI>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; ble&s;|&s;ed be the Name of the Lord. Judas</HI> and <HI>Pilate,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> were all In&s;trumental in Mur|dering the Lord Je&s;us: <HI>With wicked hands they
<PB N="7" REF="001286_0039_0FB277A608C87190">
did Crucify and Slay him,</HI> Act. 2.23. Yet we are told, Rom. 8.32. <HI>God &s;pared not his own Son, but de|livered him up for us all.</HI> Twas God, that brought Death upon his only begotten Son; though wicked men were wicked In&s;truments of it. <HI>Shimei</HI> did wickedly, in reviling <HI>David</HI> as he did, yet <HI>David</HI> &s;ays, 2 Sam. 16.10. <HI>The Lord hath &s;aid unto him, cur&s;e David.</HI> What, did God bid and command <HI>Shimei,</HI> thus to cur&s;e <HI>David?</HI> No, He forbad it, Exod. 22.28. <HI>Thou &s;halt not revile the gods, nor cur&s;e the Ruler of thy People.</HI> But <HI>Davids</HI> meaning was, <HI>God in his Holy, Ju&s;t and Sovereign Providence, had permitted Shimei thus wickedly to re|vile him. David</HI> took notice of <HI>God's Hand,</HI> even in <HI>Mans Wickedne&s;s.</HI> When wicked men Afflict us, they are but In&s;truments of a Spotle&s;s Holy Providence therein: they are but a rod in God's Hand, I&s;a. 10.5. <HI>O A&s;&s;yrian, the rod of mine Anger, and the Staff in their hand is mine Indignation.</HI> Chap. 42. v. 24. <HI>Who gave Jacob for a Spoil, and I&s;rael to the Robbers? Did not the Lord, he again&s;t whom we have Sinned?</HI> Yes, twas he indeed. If the vile&s;t and wickede&s;t of men, do in the mo&s;t wicked manner that can be, bring Affliction upon us; yet we ought to &s;ee and acknowledge God's Hand, even in that Affliction. Yea tho&s;e Af|flictions which are counted the mo&s;t <HI>Ca&s;ual,</HI> and <HI>Accidental</HI> as to men and means; are as truly the effects of God's Holy Wi&s;e All-governing Provi|dence, as any thing el&s;e in the World is. Hence, if a Man is <HI>Cutting Wood,</HI> and his <HI>Ax flies off and
<PB N="8" REF="001286_0040_0FB277A890D3C128">
kill's his Neighbour that &s;tands by,</HI> (Deut. 19.5.) <HI>God</HI> is &s;aid, <HI>to deliver his Neighbour into his hand,</HI> Exod. 21.13. Well then, this Principle mu&s;t be fixed upon our Souls, That <HI>all our Afflictions come from Gods Hand,</HI> who&s;oever or what&s;oever are the Means or In&s;truments of them. <HI>God does what he will, in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inha|bitants of the Earth: He does according to his plea|&s;ure in Heaven, Earth, Sea, and in all deep places,</HI> P&s;al. 135.6. Tis impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould quietly Submit to God's Will, under our Afflictions; if we dont take notice of his Hand in them. <HI>Da|vid</HI> &s;ays to God, P&s;al. 39.9. <HI>I was dumb, and o|pened not my Mouth, becau&s;e thou did&s;t it.</HI></P>
<P>Another Con&s;ideration is,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That God has Supream Sovereign right and Au|thority, to do with us what he will&punc;</HI> We are often offended with Man, and that very ju&s;tly, when they go beyond their line, and do tho&s;e things again&s;t us which they have no Authority for. But God has made all things out of nothing; and he pre&s;erveth them all. <HI>All things are and were created for his plea&s;ure,</HI> Rev. 4.11. God has made all things for him&s;elf. And &s;ince he has thus made, and does pre&s;erve all things; he mu&s;t needs be the &s;upream Lord, the Soveraign own|ner of them, P&s;al. 24.1. <HI>The earth is the Lords, and the fulne&s;s thereof; the World and they that dwell therein.</HI> Therefore God may di&s;po&s;e of us and
<PB N="9" REF="001286_0041_0FB277ABF1194E30">
of what we have, as he &s;ees meet. <HI>He may do what he will with his own.</HI> We may not &s;ay to him, What do&s;t thou? or, Why do&s;t thou &s;o? God may do as he will, make what di&s;tinction he plea&s;eth between per&s;ons. He may load one Man with <HI>Honour,</HI> and another with <HI>Contempt;</HI> may make one <HI>very Rich,</HI> and another as remark|ably <HI>Poor;</HI> He may continue to one per&s;on his de&s;irable <HI>Relations,</HI> and take the Like from a|nother, in what way and manner he will. For he gives none account of his matters. Men often meddle with things, which don't concern them; God never does &s;o. He may do what|&s;oever he will, for he is Sovereign Lord and owner of all Creatures. As the <HI>clay is in the Pot|ter's hand, &s;o are we in God's hand,</HI> Jer. 18.6. <HI>The thing formed, &s;hould not &s;ay to him that formed it, why ha&s;t thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the Clay, of the &s;ame lump to make one ve&s;&s;el un|to honour, and another unto di&s;honour?</HI> Rom. 9.20, 21. The con&s;ideration, of Gods ab&s;olute indi&s;|putable Supremacy and Sovereignity, &s;hould prevent all Murmurings again&s;t his Providence. O Man, why do&s;t thou Murmur at thy Afflicti|ons? did not God bring them? yea &s;urely he did, what&s;oever were the In&s;truments of them. And what, wilt thou find fault with God? Is not he Sovereign owner, and Governour of all Creatures? May not he do what he will with his own? Then, whi&s;t, hold thy peace, be &s;till and know that he is God.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="10" REF="001286_0042_0FB277AEB4DAE240">3. <HI>Our Afflictions are far le&s;s than our Iniquities de&s;erve.</HI> Indeed the Saints &s;ometimes meet with &s;ore troubles; the Holy Spirit calls them, <HI>grie|vous for the pre&s;ent,</HI> Heb. 12.11. Yet the very be&s;t of men de&s;erve far greater troubles, than any ever met with in this World. All men are <HI>Sin|ners</HI> by <HI>natures,</HI> and more or le&s;s by <HI>practice</HI> too. <HI>There is not a Ju&s;t man upon Earth, that doth good and &s;inneth not,</HI> Eccle&s;. 7.20. Now we are told, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.23. <HI>The wages of Sin is Death.</HI> 'Tis Eter|nal Death and Mi&s;ery. Therefore what&s;oever trouble we meet with, &s;hort of Eternal Death, &s;hort of Everla&s;ting Vengeance, is far le&s;s than our Iniquities de&s;erve. 'Tis proper therefore to &s;ay, as <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.39. <HI>Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the puni&s;hment of his Sins?</HI> What, <HI>Living,</HI> and yet complain? That is groundle&s;s indeed. For Sin de&s;erves <HI>Death,</HI> therefore while <HI>Life</HI> is continued, he does not &s;uffer &s;o much as his Sin de&s;erves; and &s;o 'tis unrea&s;onable for him to find fault. Indeed we may truly &s;ay with <HI>Jacob,</HI> Gen. 32.10. <HI>We are not worthy of the lea&s;t of all the Mercies</HI> be&s;tow'd upon us. Under our greate&s;t loads of mi&s;ery, we may truly acknowledge with him, <HI>Ezra</HI> 9.13. <HI>God has puni&s;hed us le&s;s than our Iniquities de&s;erve.</HI> Under the &s;ore&s;t trials we ever meet with, we may truly &s;ay, as <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.22. <HI>'Tis of the Lords mercy we are not con&s;umed.</HI> In&s;tead of Murmuring becau&s;e our <HI>Afflictions</HI> are <HI>&s;o great,</HI> we &s;hould ac|knowledge
<PB N="11" REF="001286_0043_0FB277B05A06B458">
'tis a <HI>mercy,</HI> that they are not <HI>great|er;</HI> even &s;o as utterly to con&s;ume and de&s;troy us. If Chri&s;tians would but &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider &s;uch things as the&s;e; doubtle&s;s 'twould be very u&s;eful to prevent and &s;uppre&s;s in them, Mur|muring and repining under their &s;ore&s;t Afflicti|ons. O Chri&s;tian, why do&s;t thou find fault? Has God wrong'd thee in any thing? Is he un|ju&s;t? Has he laid heavier burthens on thee, than thou de&s;erve&s;t? If he has not, thou ha&s;t no rea&s;on to complain of his dealings. And &s;urely he does not lay upon thee, more than thou de&s;erve&s;t. For the Judge of all the Earth will do right. For <HI>He's righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works,</HI> P&s;al. 145.17. While thou art out of Hell, thy Mi&s;ery is not &s;o great as thy Sin.

Let us heartily &s;ay as <HI>David</HI> did, 2 Sam. 15.26. <HI>Behold here am I, let him do unto me, as &s;eemeth good unto him.</HI> And e&s;pecially under all our Afflictions, let our main care be, <HI>to grow more Holy.</HI> Every Afflicti|on is <HI>God's Rod,</HI> and his Rod has a <HI>Voice;</HI> and the <HI>Voice</HI> is, <HI>That we &s;hould grow more Holy. He cha&s;tens us for our Profit, that we might be partakers of his Holine&s;s,</HI> Heb. 12.10. This in general, is the Me&s;&s;age, the Errand, on which every Af|fliction comes from God unto us.

But we are more rude and vile, in our carriage to the Great GOD; if we don't &s;o hear his Voice in Affliction, as to grow more Holy thereby. But if we do grow more Holy by Afflictions, then we &s;hall have rea&s;on to &s;ay with <HI>David,</HI> (though our tryals are never &s;o &s;harp &amp; &s;evere) as P&s;al. 119.67, 71, 75. <HI>Before I was Afflicted, I went a&s;tray; but now have I kept thy word: &mdash; It is good for me that I have been Afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes: &mdash; I know O Lord that thy Judgments are right, and that thou in faithfullne&s;s ha&s;t Af|flicted me.</HI></P>
