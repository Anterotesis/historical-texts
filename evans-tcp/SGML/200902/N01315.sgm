<HEAD>Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THE Publication of this ESSAY, to Quicken <HI>Early Piety,</HI> after &s;o many that have gone before it, needs no Apology; for it is not Po&s;&s;ible to make too many. The <HI>Subject</HI> is Copious; the <HI>Object</HI> is Nume|rous; the <HI>Occa&s;ions</HI> are Infinite.</P>
<P>The SERMON which is now laid before the Reader, has nothing <HI>Extraordi|nary</HI> in the Compo&s;ure of it. He has in|deed here only the Fir&s;t, Rude, Untran|&s;cribed and &s;o Unpoli&s;hed Notes of the <HI>Sermon,</HI> Written and Preached by One, who is pretty tolerably Employ'd at Con|&s;tant, and Frequent Preaching. But the <HI>Importance</HI> of it is <HI>Extraordinary;</HI> and &s;ome|times the le&s;s of <HI>Poli&s;hment,</HI> the more does

the Sovereign Grace of Heaven give Suc|ce&s;s to our <HI>Plain Di&s;cour&s;es.</HI> Before the <HI>Sermon</HI> is out, the Reader will &s;ee why &amp; whence it comes unto him; yea, &s;urely he <HI>will Hear,</HI> when he finds, That <HI>One comes unto him from the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>In&s;tead of going to <HI>Tullies Offices,</HI> I will go to <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI>'s for a brief Recital of the Ornaments with which we would Fain &s;ee our Young People Beautified&punc; <HI>Honor Adolu&s;centum e&s;t, Timorem Dei habere; Parent thus deferre; Honorem habere &s;eniori|bus; Ca&s;titatem non a&s;pernari; diligere Cle|mentiam et Verecundiam quae Ornamenta &s;unt Juvenilis Aetatis.</HI> Oh!

<P>IT is then an <HI>Angelical Service</HI> which I am upon. To bring the Me&s;&s;a|ges of Heaven to <HI>Young Men,</HI> is an <HI>Angelical Service.</HI> It &s;eems there is not an <HI>Angel</HI> in the Ble&s;&s;ed Realms of Light, but what would rejoice to ar|rive among you, on the Service &amp; the Er|rand
<PB N="2" REF="001564_0005_0FB3AF4CF21365A0">
wherein the <HI>Chief of Sinners</HI> is now Engaged. If I keep clo&s;e to my <HI>In&s;tructi|ons,</HI> and bring to you nothing but what is Propounded and Supported, from the <HI>Ora|cles</HI> of God, which I &s;hall Endeavour to do, you will hear nothing, but what will call for as much Regard, as if it were bro't by an <HI>Angel</HI> from Heaven. Sirs, What if you &s;hould this Day &s;ee, what the Belo|ved <HI>John</HI> &s;aw upon a <HI>Lords-Day</HI> of old; An <HI>Angel</HI> flying among you, with the <HI>Everla&s;t|ing Go&s;pel</HI> to Preach unto you; and &s;aying with a Loud Voice; <Q>O all People, and very Particularly O Young People, Fear God, and give Glory to Him!</Q> Certainly, You would hear with much Attention, with much Af|fection, with a mo&s;t awful Reverence. Behold, A very Sinful Man, but coming in the Name of the mo&s;t Glorious LORD, brings to you, the <HI>Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel;</HI> He <HI>Runs</HI> to bring it, unto the <HI>Young People</HI> in the Neighbourhood. It is no other than what an <HI>Angel</HI> from Heaven, would be willing to bring among you; and it is as awfully to be Regarded!</P>
<P>Our Prophet <HI>Zechariah,</HI> was favoured with an Apparition of an <HI>Angel</HI> unto him; and the <HI>Angel</HI> in this Exhibition, gave him
<PB N="3" REF="001564_0006_0FB3AF4ED31D6308">
a Pro&s;pect of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> going to be laid out, and rebuilt, under the Influences of the God, who &s;ets Bounds to our Habita|tions. This <HI>Angel</HI> is met by another <HI>An|gel,</HI> who brings him an Order from God, immediately to <HI>Run unto that Young Man, and &s;peak unto him</HI> &s;omething that it would be very Profitable and very Comfortable for him to be acquainted withal.</P>
<P>In <HI>Imitation</HI> of that <HI>Good Angel;</HI> and who can be better imitated? &mdash; I will now <HI>Run</HI> and <HI>Speak</HI> unto tho&s;e <HI>Young</HI> Per&s;ons whom I have now before me, &s;ome very Ob&s;ervable Things: And you will &s;ee anon, perhaps with &s;ome Surprize, my <HI>Text</HI> admirably &s;upplying me, with all my Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>There is fir&s;t a <HI>General Doctrine,</HI> which I &s;hall bring unto you; and make it a mo&s;t agreeable <HI>Preliminary</HI> &amp; <HI>Introduction,</HI> unto the more Particular <HI>In&s;tructions,</HI> that are to En&s;ue upon it. And this is,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>The DOCTRINE.</HI> There are things of no &s;mall Importance, which the Great <HI>GOD</HI> orders to be &s;poken unto Young Per&s;ons; yea, to be Earnestly &s;poken unto them.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001564_0007_0FB3AF500689E788">There is not a <HI>Young Man</HI> among us, but the Great GOD has given Order, <HI>Speak to this Young Man.</HI> Yea, My Child, The Great GOD <HI>Him&s;elf</HI> &s;peaks unto thee The <HI>Maxims of Piety</HI> are tho&s;e Important Things, which the Great GOD Orders to be &s;poken, unto all the Children of Men. The Maxims are addre&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e very Terms; P&s;al. XLIX. 1. <HI>Hear this All ye People, give ear All ye Inhabitants of the World.</HI> But they that are <HI>Children in Age,</HI> are very Particularly to look on them&s;elves, as con|cerned in the Addre&s;s of &s;uch Things. <HI>Young Per&s;ons</HI> mu&s;t not look on them&s;elves unconcerned in he <HI>Maxims of Piety;</HI> Tho&s;e Things are of as much Importance unto <HI>Young Per&s;ons,</HI> as unto any in the World; The Voice of God which utters tho&s;e Things, is as much Directed unto <HI>Young Per&s;ons</HI> as unto any in the World.</P>
<P>We will at once Enquire; <HI>How tis that the Great</HI> GOD <HI>Speaks unto Young Per&s;ons:</HI> and, <HI>What are the mo&s;t Important Things that He would have to be Spoken unto them?</HI></P>
<P>Our An&s;wer to the&s;e Complicated En|quiries, is this.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. There are Important Things, which the Great GOD &s;peaks unto <HI>Young
<PB N="5" REF="001564_0008_0FB3AF516511A3A8">
Per&s;ons,</HI> in the <HI>Light of Nature,</HI> the Light of <HI>Natural Rea&s;on,</HI> that which <HI>Enlightneth every Man that comes into the World.</HI> It is of all things, the mo&s;t Evident; <HI>There is a Spirit in man, and the In&s;piration of the Al|mighty has given him an &V;nder&s;tanding,</HI> of much <HI>Duty</HI> which he owes to his Almighty Maker. The Rational Spirit of man, is apprized of, and furni&s;hed with, certain <HI>Principles,</HI> which are in&s;tamped thereon, by the <HI>God who forms the Spirit of man within him.</HI> The Inwrought, the Innate <HI>Princi|ples,</HI> in the <HI>Rational Spirit</HI> of man, di&s;po&s;e him to acknowledge Things <HI>Good</HI> &amp; <HI>Evil,</HI> Things <HI>Right</HI> &amp; <HI>Wrong;</HI> as well as Things <HI>True</HI> &amp; <HI>Fal&s;e.</HI> Tho' he may not always make the <HI>Actual Acknowledgment,</HI> yet if the <HI>Light</HI> be brought unto him, or things be &s;et in their due <HI>Light</HI> before him, he is quickly Compell'd unto it. We read, Prov. XX. 27. <HI>The Spirit of man is the Candle of the Lord.</HI> Young People, The Great GOD has Lighted His <HI>Candle</HI> in your Souls. You Know, and you cannot but Own, That <HI>there is a GOD,</HI> unto whom you owe all po&s;&s;ible Homage and Obedi|ence. You Know, and you cannot but Own, That you are ba&s;e Wretches, if you

don't <HI>Honour,</HI> and <HI>Obey,</HI> and <HI>Requite</HI> your <HI>Parents.</HI> You Know, and you cannot but Own, That in your Dealings with your Neighbours, you <HI>ought to do as you would be done unto.</HI> The&s;e Three things are as Plain, as that Three and Three make Six. If you do but behold, the <HI>Works</HI> of God, in the <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of the World, the&s;e will Proclaim &s;uch Things unto you; God &s;peaks unto you &s;uch Things as the&s;e by all the <HI>Works of His Hands.</HI> The <HI>Dictates</HI> of the <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> within you, are awakened, are inferred, are confirmed, from all the <HI>Works</HI> of God about you. You may Rea|&s;onably Gather many Le&s;&s;ons of Piety, from all the <HI>Works of God;</HI> yea, <HI>There is no Speech nor Language, where their Voice is not heard.</HI> Alas, if you <HI>Forget</HI> God, or if you <HI>Abu&s;e</HI> one another, you <HI>Rebel again&s;t the Light,</HI> with which the God that <HI>Made</HI> you, and <HI>Form'd</HI> you, has accommodated you. God &s;peaks unto you, and you &s;top your Ears a|gain&s;t the Voice, that &s;hould make the Pillars of Heaven to tremble. You have a <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> which terribly Condemns you for your Wickedne&s;s. If you <HI>Go on</HI> &s;till in doing Wickedly, you may Rationally Conclude, that the Great God &s;peaks this
<PB N="7" REF="001564_0010_0FB3AF578FD74858">
al&s;o unto you; <HI>Rebel, He that Made thee will not have Mercy on thee, &amp; He that Form'd thee, will &s;hew thee no Favour.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. There are Important Things which the Great GOD &s;peaks unto <HI>Young Per&s;ons,</HI> in the <HI>Spectacles,</HI> which they have before them, in the Di&s;pen&s;ations of His Providence. There are Two &s;orts of <HI>Spectacles,</HI> wherewith Young Per&s;ons are continually Entertained by the Providence of God. One thing daily to be &s;een by <HI>Young Per&s;ons,</HI> is that; Prov XIII. 21. <HI>E|vil pur&s;ueth Sinners.</HI> Children, You &s;ee &s;uch as are <HI>Wicked Overmuch, Dy before their Time.</HI> You &s;ee, Such as won't keep their <HI>Tongues from Evil,</HI> don't <HI>&s;ee Many Days,</HI> or <HI>much Good</HI> in their Days. You &s;ee Profane, Vitious, <HI>Debauched</HI> Children, &s;oon Plung'd into woful Mi&s;eries. You &s;ee <HI>&V;ndutiful</HI> Children Cut off by the tre|mendous Vengeance of God. You &s;ee Heaven Di&s;charging its Thunderbolts on the Heads of them that will <HI>Go on still in their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</HI> The Great God &s;peaks to you in what you &s;ee. The Thundring Voice of God unto you, in &s;uch <HI>Spectacles,</HI> is, <HI>O take heed of all Impiety. O don't by work of Darkne&s;s, pull down upon your
<PB N="8" REF="001564_0011_0FB3AF59298885C8">
&s;elves the Strange Puni&s;hments re&s;erved in outer Darkne&s;s, for the Workers of Iniquity!</HI> Another thing daily to be &s;een by <HI>Young Per&s;ons,</HI> is that: Job XXXVI. 14. <HI>They Dy in Youth.</HI> Children, You &s;ee <HI>all Ages</HI> liable to the &s;troke of <HI>Death.</HI> You &s;ee <HI>Children Dy</HI> as well as <HI>Old Men;</HI> Ten times more Dy before Twenty than After Sixty. You &s;ee <HI>Children</HI> carried from the <HI>Cradle</HI> to the <HI>Sepulchre;</HI> and Graves in the Burying-place, that are &s;horter than the Younge&s;t of you. You &s;ee <HI>Children Dy</HI> as well as they that are an <HI>Hundred years old; Infants</HI> Lock'd up in Coffins; and as they u&s;e to &s;ay, <HI>Skulls of all Sizes in Golgotha.</HI> You &s;ee, Some with whom the <HI>Sun goes down at Noon,</HI> and &s;ome with whom the <HI>Morning</HI> is turn'd into the <HI>Shadow of Death.</HI> The Great God &s;peaks to you, in what you &s;ee. The Lively Voice of God unto you in &s;uch <HI>Spectacles,</HI> is; <HI>O don't vainly Promi&s;e a long Life unto your &s;elves. O do not upon a vain Pre&s;umption of a long Life, put off your Pre|parations for Death, and your laying hold on Eternal Life!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. There are Important Things, which the Great GOD &s;peaks unto <HI>Young Per&s;ons,</HI> in His Glorious <HI>Go&s;pel;</HI> that <HI>Grace</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="001564_0012_0FB3AF5A6A770C48">
of His, which does <HI>bring Salvation;</HI> that <HI>Voice of Him that &s;peaks from Heaven.</HI> Young Per&s;ons have the <HI>Bible</HI> in their Hands, the Book of God, and of Life; the <HI>Scripture given by In&s;piration of God.</HI> It may be &s;aid of our Children, as 2 Tim III. 15. <HI>From a Child thou ha&s;t known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wi&s;e unto Salva|tion.</HI> The Parents will be inexcu&s;able, and more Uncompa&s;&s;ionate unto their Off|&s;pring than <HI>O&s;triches</HI> and <HI>Sea-mon&s;ters,</HI> and mu&s;t not be called, <HI>Chri&s;tian Parents,</HI> if they do not what they can, that their <HI>Children</HI> may have the <HI>Bible</HI> in their Hands, and in their Minds. Children, You have the Great GOD &s;peaking to you in the <HI>Bible.</HI> When ever you look into the <HI>Bible,</HI> it &s;hould be with this <HI>Per&s;wa&s;ion;</HI> you &s;hould often look into the Bible on this <HI>Intention; I will hear what God will &s;peak unto me!</HI> The Voice of the Great God unto you in your <HI>Bible</HI> is that; P&s;al. XXXIV. 11. <HI>Come ye Children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the Fear of the Lord.</HI> The <HI>Bible</HI> is a <HI>Letter from Heaven</HI> as much unto <HI>you,</HI> as if your very Name, were in the Super&s;cription of it. And that you may be the more &s;en&s;ible of God &s;peaking unto you here,
<PB N="10" REF="001564_0013_0FB3AF5C0ED122F8">
you are here yet more di&s;tingui&s;hingly call'd upon. So you are, Eccl XII. 1. <HI>Re|member now thy Creator in the days of thy youth.</HI> So you are, P&s;al. CXLVIII. 12, 13. <HI>Both young Men and Maidens, old Men &amp; Children. Let them Prai&s;e the Name of the Lord.</HI> So you are, in all the Scriptural Ex|amples of <HI>Early Piety.</HI> But be&s;ides this; When the Word of God is Opened and Applied in the <HI>Sermons</HI> of His Mini&s;ters; <HI>young Per&s;ons</HI> make a part of our Audi|tory. <HI>Young Per&s;ons</HI> are to take their Portion in all the <HI>Sermons</HI> of the Evange|lical Mini&s;try, wherein Wi&s;dom &s;ays unto them, <HI>&V;nto you, O Men, I Call, and my Voice is to the Sons of Men.</HI> Yea, the Prudent and Faithful <HI>Stewards</HI> in the Hou&s;e of God, will &s;ometimes Carve out a <HI>Special Portion</HI> for the <HI>Young Per&s;ons</HI> in their Auditory. The Servants of God will be careful to avoid that Character of the Fooli&s;h Shep|herd; Zach&punc; XI. 16&punc; <HI>Which &s;hall not &s;eek the young one.</HI> Children, When <HI>Sermons</HI> are Preaching, you have the Great GOD &s;peaking to you in them. In&s;tead of <HI>Sport|ing,</HI> or <HI>Sleeping,</HI> or any Irreverent Carri|age here, Oh, with what <HI>Reverence and Godly Fear</HI> ought you to behave your &s;elves;
<PB N="11" REF="001564_0014_0FB3AF5D64F17560">
and think, <HI>How dreadful is this Place? Tis the Hou&s;e of God, and the Gate of Heaven! Tis not a weak Man, but the Great GOD, who is now &s;peaking to me!</HI> It is the Great GOD, who tells you in our Sermons, That you need a <HI>Saviour;</HI> and that you will find the Lovely JESUS, a Mighty, a Rea|dy, and an Only Saviour. It is the Great GOD who tells you, That you mu&s;t Walk in His <HI>Fear,</HI> and in all <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s</HI> before Him. It is the Great GOD, who tells you, That <HI>He will bring every Work into Judgment, and Reward every man ac|cording to His Work.</HI> You are Deaf to GOD, if you hear us not!</P>
<P>There is an <HI>Improvement,</HI> which the Great GOD has Ordered me to make of the&s;e things. There is this thing to be &s;poken, yea, to be <HI>Earne&s;tly Spoken,</HI> unto the <HI>Young People</HI> in this A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Zion: Oh! Take a due Notice of the Things, which the Great GOD Orders to be &s;poken to you;</HI> Children, Pay a due Re&s;pect unto tho&s;e things! Methinks, I overhear the Holy One &s;aying to me, <HI>Run, Speak to the&s;e Young People.</HI> To <HI>Run,</HI> is the Motion of one in <HI>Earne&s;t.</HI> I mu&s;t now be <HI>in Earnest</HI> with you. Children, That which I am <HI>Earne&s;t|ly</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="001564_0015_0FB3AF6016C48D60">
to &s;peak unto you, is this; GOD has been &s;peaking to you; <HI>The Mighty</HI> GOD, <HI>even the</HI> LORD <HI>hath Spoken</HI> to you. Now, Oh! Mind what He &s;peaks; Let the <HI>Voice of God</HI> have a due, and a deep Im|pre&s;&s;ion upon you. What a Ble&s;&s;ed Inter|cour&s;e was that between the Great GOD, and the Child <HI>Samuel!</HI> 1 Sam. III. 10. <HI>And the Lord came, &amp; &s;tood &amp; called as at other times,</HI> Samuel, Samuel. <HI>Then</HI> Samuel <HI>an|&s;wered, Speak for thy Servant Heareth.</HI> O Young People, The Great GOD comes, &amp; &s;tands, &amp; calls unto thee very many times over; <HI>Sinner, Sinner, Soul Peri&s;hing in thy Sin, O For&s;ake thy Sin, and Embrace thy Saviour!</HI> Under the Admonitions of God, O Children, Be able to an&s;wer; <HI>Lord, I hear what thou &s;peake&s;t; and I de&s;ire to be thy Servant. The Commands, the Comforts, the Reproofs of thy Word, Lord, Thy Servant would hearken to them.</HI></P>
<P>The Thing which I have to demand of you, is; That you ca&s;t no Scorn upon the <HI>Word of God;</HI> but that you Comply with the <HI>Voice of God</HI> &s;peaking to you in His Word. The Demand is, That you <HI>Mind,</HI> and that you <HI>Do</HI> tho&s;e things, which God &s;hall &s;peak unto you; and be <HI>a&s;hamed</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="001564_0016_0FB3AF61D317AA30">
of not having <HI>Re&s;pect unto all His Command|ments. Child,</HI> He is thy <HI>Father,</HI> and He &s;hould be, Oh! Let thy Choice make Him, <HI>the Guide of thy Youth.</HI> We read of &s;ome Young People, 1 Joh. II. 14. <HI>Ye are Strong, and the Word of God abideth in you.</HI> Oh! Give a due Reception to the <HI>Word of God. Lodge</HI> it in your Under&s;tandings, your Me|mories, your Affections. <HI>Hide</HI> it in your <HI>Hearts,</HI> with di&s;po&s;itions to be thereby Pre&s;erved and Re&s;cued from your <HI>Sins.</HI></P>
<P>To Enforce this <HI>Early Piety</HI> on our Chil|dren, I will <HI>Run,</HI> and <HI>Earne&s;tly Speak</HI> the&s;e two things unto them. Yea, you &s;hall pre|&s;ently &s;ee, that the Great GOD has Or|dered me to &s;peak the&s;e things.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t Thing is, <HI>That the Great</HI> GOD <HI>will deal with you, as you deal with His Word.</HI> Children, <HI>Love</HI> the Word of God, and God will Place His <HI>Love</HI> upon you. <HI>Trea&s;ure</HI> up the Word of God, and God will make you His Peculiar <HI>Trea&s;ure. Con|tain</HI> the Word of God, and your Portion from God &s;hall be <HI>Shame and Everla&s;ting Contempt.</HI> O that your <HI>Ears</HI> were open to this <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> and that &s;uch an <HI>Instruction</HI> as this from and for the Word of God were <HI>Sealed</HI> unto you. It &s;peaks thus;
<PB N="14" REF="001564_0017_0FB3AF62C95E6C18">
<HI>Them that Honour me, the GOD that &s;peaks in me will Honour; they who De&s;pi&s;e me, &s;hall be lightly E&s;teemed of the GOD who &s;hines &amp; breathes in me.</HI></P>
<P>I remember a Remarkable Pa&s;&s;age, 2 Tim. I. 12, 14. <HI>He is able to keep, that which I have committed unto Him.</HI> And, <HI>That good thing which was committed unto thee, do thou keep.</HI> The Jews mention Two <HI>Depo&s;itums</HI> of God; The <HI>Lamp</HI> within us, or, the <HI>Soul;</HI> And the <HI>Lamp</HI> without us, or, the <HI>Law;</HI> and they introduce the Great GOD &s;peaking thus unto us; <HI>My Lamp which is my Law, is in thy Hand; and thy Lamp, which is thy Soul, is in Mine.

Child, Thy God has Commu|nion with thee, when He <HI>Awakens</HI> thee, when He <HI>Aba&s;es</HI> thee, when He brings <HI>Con|tritions</HI> upon thee, as well as when He Ra|vi&s;hes thee with His <HI>Con&s;olations which are not Small.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Young Per&s;ons hold <HI>Commu|nion</HI> with the Great GOD, in what they <HI>Render</HI> to Him. The <HI>Returns,</HI> which Young Per&s;ons make unto God by His A&s;&s;i&s;tence, the&s;e are their Communion with Him. Children, Your God calls for your <HI>Heart;</HI> He &s;ays; Prov. XXIII. 26. <HI>My Son, Give me thy Heart.</HI> You hold Communion with Him, when you give Him your <HI>Heart;</HI> when your <HI>Heart</HI> is filled with &s;uitable Thoughts of Him; when you place the De&s;ire of your <HI>Heart,</HI> the Delight of your <HI>Heart,</HI> the Dependence of your <HI>Heart</HI> upon Him. To <HI>Pray</HI> unto God, is to <HI>Commons</HI> with Him; When
<PB N="31" REF="001564_0034_0FB3AF825CEAD118">
Young Per&s;ons Repair to the Great GOD with the Reque&s;t of their <HI>Heart,</HI> then they hold Communion with Him. If their <HI>Heart</HI> be in the Reque&s;t, then tis an <HI>Hearty,</HI> a <HI>Real,</HI> a <HI>Proper</HI> Communion. Young Per&s;ons have Communion with the Great GOD, in every Acknowledgment they make of Him. They have Communion with Him in all their Ways, when they <HI>Ac|knowledge Him in all their Ways.</HI> Indeed, Young Per&s;ons have <HI>Communion</HI> with God, in all their <HI>Obedience</HI> to Him. When God <HI>Requires</HI> and they <HI>Obey,</HI> there is a mo&s;t a|miable Communion between Him and Them. In &s;hort, To be <HI>Sen&s;ible</HI> of God, is to have <HI>Communion</HI> with Him. Young Per&s;ons Conver&s;e with God, when they <HI>Think of</HI> Him: when they <HI>Set the Lord be|fore them;</HI> when they are <HI>Sen&s;ible</HI> of Him Speaking to them, or Dealing with them.</P>
<P>This is that <HI>Communion with Heaven</HI> whereto Young People may be admitted.</P>
<P>And, in what Ways may they now Seek and Gain Admi&s;&s;ion to it?</P>
<P>Children; The Fir&s;t Thing which I mu&s;t mind you of, and Charge you to be ever mindful of, is this: Don't forget the <HI>Mercy-Seat.</HI></P>

<P>Secondly; Tis in the <HI>Wayes</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> of His own <HI>Appointment,</HI> that God will hold that <HI>Communion</HI> with Young Per&s;ons, for which He has appointed them. There are,</P>
