<P>_THERE are many who imagine, that unle&s;s their Performances are dedicated to &s;ome Great Per&s;on of the fir&s;t Rank, they loo&s;e their Value, and are &s;oon thrown a&s;ide as u&s;ele&s;s&mdash;yet at the &s;ame Time are &s;o lavi&s;h of their Talents, that they think them&s;elves hap|py if they are indulged the Favour of being quite extravagant in &s;tuffing the &s;ame with ful|&s;ome Complements, but <HI>laughing in their Sleves,</HI> to u&s;e an old homely Saying, while they are en|deavouring to <HI>ingraciate</HI> them&s;elves into Favor with tho&s;e they have <HI>no real Regard for.</HI></P>
<P>But the Author of the following Piece thinks him&s;elf arriv'd almo&s;t to the Pinnacle of Honour, that he can take the Liberty, and hopes to be in|dulg'd the Favour, of addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to a great Number of <HI>Freemen,</HI> (not forgetting the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who I heard was rou&s;ed on this Occa&s;i|on, as well they might, &s;ome of whom came to &s;ee him afterwards, though he was condemn'd without Benefit of Clergy) in who&s;e Veins there is yet a <HI>free Circulation</HI> of that noble Blood,

<SALUTE>Candid Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is cu&s;tomary for Authors to apologize by Way of Preface to the World for their Writings; and &s;urely tho&s;e of a low Cla&s;s I think, ought never to publi&s;h without one. In|deed &s;uch great Men as <HI>Lock, Pope, Dryden, Shake&s;pear, Milton,</HI> or <HI>Butler,</HI> need none to their Works, but common Scriblers &s;hould offer an Ex|cu&s;e for troubling the Public; which happens to fall to my Lot at this Time. I mu&s;t acknowlege, I &s;hould have been glad had I remain'd in <HI>Ob&s;cu|rity</HI> as I have done for many Years, and &s;lid out of this <HI>noi&s;y World unnoticed:</HI> But as there is an over-ruling Providence, and every Thing will in the End turn to the Advantage of Truth and Hone&s;ty; &s;ometimes even in this Life, but mo&s;t certainly will in the <HI>future.</HI>&mdash;So I de&s;ire to be re&s;ign'd, waiting for the Event.</P>
<P>But not to be too tedious, or rai&s;e the Expectati|on of the Reader, with more in my Title and Pre|face, than there is in the Book it&s;elf, &s;hall only ob&s;erve, That I doubt not the following Piece will be thought by many, if not all, who peru&s;e it, to be

a <HI>new, remarkable, unprecedented Procedure,</HI> e&s;pecially as it was done in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation: Therefore &s;hall &s;ubmit this plain, hone&s;t Account of the whole Matter, to your better Judgment, who &s;hall take the Pains to give it a reading; and doubt not all proper Allowance will be made, as it is the fir&s;t Time the Author has taken the Freedom, or rather Courage, to venture without a Pilot, as he would not willingly have any one even <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> to be concern'd, le&s;t it &s;hould be accounted a <HI>Libel,</HI> and upon that very <HI>SUSPICION,</HI> be thrown into a &s;tinking Stone Goal, though never &s;o innocent, and &s;uffer in the <HI>&s;ame Manner</HI> as if he was the <HI>real Author:</HI> without Law, nay, contrary to Law, and in direct Oppo&s;ition even to the poor dim Light of Nature, if I am not very much mi&s;taken. And as I have experienc'd the &s;ame for another Per&s;on (and it may perhaps be the Lot of many more, unle&s;s divine Providence, in the U&s;e of appointed Means, interpo&s;e) yet I would not wi&s;h my greate&s;t Enemy to remain there &s;o long, unle&s;s I was &s;ure it was lawful to take away his Life, as it had like to have co&s;t me mine&mdash;there|fore would not publi&s;h this Affair, if I apprehended any other Per&s;on would be thought the Author be|&s;ides my&s;elf, or any ways acce&s;&s;ory thereto; but I am well a&s;&s;ur'd the plain unpoli&s;h'd Stile it ap|pears in, will convince them to the contrary, and that it is only their bumble Servant,</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>PERHAPS there has not any Occurrence for many Years happen'd, e&s;pecially, in this Country, which has occa&s;ion'd <HI>more Speculation</HI> than a late Proceeding of the Lower Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly again&s;t the Author of the following Piece, only upon <HI>Su&s;picion</HI> of his being concern'd in printing and pub|li&s;hing a Pamphlet entitled, <HI>The MOMSTER of MON|STERS</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>There has not, &s;ays the Author of this Pamphlet, to my Know|lege, been any</HI> Mon&s;ter <HI>in this Town; nor any Thing like a</HI> Mon&s;ter. <HI>There has nothing happened lately which could na|turally give Occa&s;ion to &s;uch a</HI> Fiction; <HI>nor any Thing to which it can be ju&s;tly apply'd in the Way of Allegorical Interpreta|tion. And the Per&s;ons who &s;hall attempt this, mu&s;t be very</HI> &s;imple, or ill-natur'd, <HI>for it is mercly a</HI> Work of Fancy and Imagination, <HI>of which there is neither Type nor Antitype. And having declar'd this, I think I may innocently let it &s;ee the Lights, as a very harmle&s;s, toothle&s;s Producton, wi&s;hing that all other</HI> Romancers <HI>and</HI> Storytellers <HI>had been as fair and ingenuous, to undeceive their Readers&mdash;Pag. 23.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Had Expre&s;&s;es been immediately di&s;patch'd the News could not have flew quicker to the mo&s;t di&s;tant Parts of the Province, and the other Governments upon the Continent; and no Doubt will be the <HI>Wonder</HI> of our <HI>Mother Country,</HI> when they have a true Account of this notable Affair, which if the Reader will but have Patience a while, he will find it was an <HI>unheard of Attack upon the Liberty of an Engli&s;hman,</HI> than which &s;carcely any Thing is dearer, if he has but the
<PB N="8" REF="007418_0007_102D834BC14D30E0">
Spirit of a Man: And as my Antagoni&s;ts in a few Months will become weak as other Men, and loo&s;e their Strength, as <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> did when his Locks was &s;horne, no one can object, but that I &s;hall be upon an Equality with them, &s;o that what was done only by a <HI>pretended Power,</HI> (which is no very good Character, when Laws <HI>human</HI> and <HI>divine,</HI> as well as <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> are &s;et a&s;ide) will have a due Con&s;i|deration.</P>
<P>And though it may be thought by &s;ome, a Freedom not becoming a private Per&s;on, to complain of a <HI>real</HI> or <HI>&s;up|po&s;ed Injury</HI> received by tho&s;e in Authority, and e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who are look'd upon the <HI>Guardians of our Liberty,</HI> and the <HI>Fathers of the Country;</HI> yet when its done with a becoming Mode&s;ty, and proper Deference, &s;urely every Man who is born free, and e&s;pecially the <Q>Engli&s;h, who de&s;erve the Liberties they enjoy; and are &s;o much the more wor|thy of them, as they have &s;pared no Pains to pre&s;erve them, who&s;e Brea&s;ts are all on Fire for Liberty:</Q> I &s;ay, when this is the Ca&s;e, every Man, who has not <HI>ju&s;tly forfeited it,</HI> will think he has a Right to vindicate him&s;elf, and have the <HI>&s;ame Satisfaction,</HI> in Proportion, as if the Injury had been done to any <HI>Gentleman of Fortune,</HI> or <HI>high Character in Life,</HI> as an unju&s;t Pre&s;ident e&s;tabli&s;h'd or conniv'd at, may be of <HI>fatal Con&s;equence</HI> to a free Con&s;titation. To u&s;e the Words of One who &s;peaking of the different Forms of Government in <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;ays, <Q>None of them appears &s;o perfect as that of <HI>England:</HI> Here it is that we find united all the Quali|fications nece&s;&s;ary to make the <HI>People happy,</HI> and the <HI>Prince great,</HI> as long as he is <HI>ju&s;t.</HI></Q> It was the Opinion of <HI>Solon,</HI> "That a State could not be happy, except the <HI>Magi&s;trates were as Subject to the Laws, as private Per&s;ons were to the Magi&s;trates.</HI> According to the Sentiments of this venera|ble Sage, the Con&s;titution of a Government &s;hould be &s;o framed, as to keep an <HI>Equilibrium</HI> between the People and the Prince." As what I am now writing is only an Intro|duction to &s;omething of an extraordinary Nature, hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed, and not incur the Cen&s;ure of being too <HI>verbo&s;e,</HI> as perhaps it might give too great a Shock to &s;ome Per&s;ons,
<PB N="9" REF="007418_0008_102D834D9EADBAB0">
and would &s;careely be credited, unle&s;s their Minds were pre|pared to receive the Truth before hand, which it my Inten|tion.</P>
<P>And as it is an acknowledged Truth, "That nothing is <HI>&s;o dear</HI> to an <HI>hone&s;t Man,</HI> as his good Name, nor ought he to neglect the ju&s;t Vindication of his Character, when it is <HI>in|juriou&s;ly</HI> attack'd by any;"&mdash;&s;o this, I think, being my Ca&s;e, I hope to make it appear to every hone&s;t, unprejudiced Per&s;on, that I have been mo&s;t &s;everely, cruelly, and unju&s;tly treated; and that I have a Right from the Laws of GOD and Man to make my Complaint, without a <HI>partial Re&s;pect to Per&s;ons;</HI> and no one will have Rea&s;on to &s;ay, <HI>I &s;peak Evil of Dignities,</HI> or of the <HI>Rulers of the People;</HI> for I am deter|min'd to &s;tick clo&s;e to the Truth, and certainly that will <HI>pre|vail</HI> with tho&s;e who have any Regard for their own Freedom, or their Po&s;terity&mdash;</P>
<P>And though I have had many Thoughts concerning the Publication of this Affair, I now think upon the whole, it is for the be&s;t; and therefore &s;hall give the Publick the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth; for &s;hould this be overlook'd, our <HI>Children perhaps may pay Reverence to a grey-headed Error;</HI> therefore this ought not to be wink'd at, lea&s;t it &s;hould take deeper Root;&mdash;but as a faithful Phy&s;i|cion would act, it ought to be cut out, and thrown away as an <HI>eating Canker,</HI> which in a little Time would eat out the <HI>Vitals</HI> of that <HI>noble Principle of Liberty,</HI> for the Sake of which our <HI>pious Forefathers</HI> ventur'd their <HI>Lives,</HI> and all that was <HI>dear</HI> to them&mdash;</P>
<P>I would endeavour to u&s;e <HI>&s;oft Words</HI> where the Subject will allow of it, &s;o as not to <HI>&s;tir up,</HI> but <HI>turn away</HI> Wrath; and <HI>&s;moother</HI> than <HI>Oyl,</HI> but at the &s;ame Time to <HI>cut like a Razor;</HI> to make it appear I am <HI>Serious,</HI> and in <HI>Earne&s;t</HI>&mdash;And there|fore &s;hall conclude this introductive Part with an Extract from the Letters of <HI>Pliny</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vcl. 2 Book 7.

<P>*&para;* Is it not very unaccountable, as this Affair took up &s;o much Time, and was carried on with <HI>&s;o much Deliberation,</HI> that it was <HI>never</HI> &s;ent up to the Honourable Board, to know if his <HI>Excellency</HI> and <HI>Honours,</HI> (who are two Branches of the Legi&s;lature) approved of it? Had this been done, as I think it &s;hould, with Submi&s;&s;ion to better Judgment; and had I been &s;o happy as to have been favour'd with their Opinion, doubt not it would have met with but a <HI>very cool Reception,</HI> and finally thrown out, as not being for the <HI>Dignity of the General A&s;&s;embly</HI> to take Notice of &s;uch an <HI>imaginary Crea|ture;</HI> or if in their Wi&s;dom &s;hould have thought otherwi&s;e, I cannot entertain the lea&s;t Doubt but that the Law would have been the Rule for my Trial, and that it could never find Place in the Heart of a &s;incere and upright Chri&s;tian of <HI>pro&s;ecuting it to Effect</HI> in the Manner it was done.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Pri&s;on-Hou&s;e, Saturday</HI> <DATE>October 26</DATE>. pa&s;t 12 o'Clock, Forenoon.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>_AS I was ordered half a Hour ago by the Pri&s;on-Keeper to come out of the clo&s;e Stone-Goal, into his Dwelling-Hou&s;e, I think it nece&s;&s;ary imme|diately to give &s;ome further Account of this <HI>extraordinary Affair,</HI> which is not mention'd fully in my fir&s;t and &s;econd Papers.</P>
<P>I have been 48 <HI>Hours confin'd in a &s;tinking clo&s;e Stone-Goal,</HI> a particular Account of which I gave in my &s;econd Paper. It is now more than ever before a <HI>plea&s;ant Thing for my Eyes to behold the Sun.</HI> I am now allow'd the U&s;e of Pen, Ink, Paper, the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing my Relations, and many Friends, whom before I knew nothing of. I &s;eem to my&s;elf as <HI>one almo&s;t ri&s;en from the Dead,</HI> and though weak in Body, can perceive a Revival as I have the Liberty of <HI>breathing a freer Air.</HI> While I was in Tribulation, I am inform'd the <HI>People were in Doubt, &s;aying one to another, What meaneth this?</HI> And tho' I had not the U&s;e of the Bible, I cannot re|member, whether that in particular was forbid me.</P>
<P>But as I have had many Thoughts, &s;ome Parts of Scripture came fre&s;h in my Mind, &s;uch as, "if this Coun&s;el or this Work be of Men, it will come to Nought;" And that "there is no Wi&s;dom nor Under&s;tanding, nor Coun&s;el again&s;t the LORD." I was inform'd <HI>about Midnight,</HI> that the Jaylor had received a &s;trict Charge to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> into Pri&s;on,</HI> and there to keep me &s;afely, but no Orders to make my <HI>Feet fa&s;t in the Stocks.</HI> Afterwards the Keeper him&s;elf told <HI>this Saying to me,</HI> which I &s;uppo&s;e came <HI>from the Magi&s;trates,</HI> TO LET ME GO; and doubt not I might have departed in Peace: But St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Words &s;eem'd to be rivited into me, &s;peaking of him&s;elf and
<PB N="24" REF="007418_0023_102D836B44BF58E8">
his Fellow-Sufferers, "They have beaten (<HI>or abu&s;ed</HI>) us openly uncondemn'd (<HI>i.e. by the Law</HI>) being <HI>Romans,</HI> and have ca&s;t us into Pri&s;on; and now do they thru&s;t us out pri|vily? Nay, verily, but let them come them&s;elves and fetch us out:" Perhaps their hard Hearts may relent, when they &s;ee the Situation we are in, as it is natural for <HI>the Eye to affect the Heart.</HI> So it is applicable in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to my Ca&s;e, as I was put into the <HI>inner Room</HI> in the Pri&s;on, and that at <HI>Midnight, uncondemn'd,</HI> i.e. by the Law; and I am an <HI>En|gli&s;hman,</HI> free-born, not having forfeited my Liberty any more than the <HI>above Romans;</HI> and I now de&s;ire that the &s;ame Au|thority that put me in, would by Virtue of that &s;ame Power take me out, and not thru&s;t me out privily. I had heard that the Chief Magi&s;trate, and &s;ome others, gave this good Advice; <HI>Take heed to your&s;elves, what ye intend to do as touching tho&s;e Man.</HI> If any &s;hould &s;ay <HI>I am mad, or be&s;ide my &s;elf;</HI> it could not be wondered at con&s;idering the Treatment I have un|ju&s;tly received; but I can affirm with all &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in the Words of <HI>St. Paul, I am not mad, but &s;peak forth the Words of Truth and Soberne&s;s.</HI> I only &s;peak freely, and <HI>every Man of common Sen&s;e</HI> has this Right, and I think every Man is more or le&s;s concern'd in an Affair of this Nature, <HI>for this Thing was not done in a Corner,</HI> unle&s;s it was in a Corner of the Court-Hou&s;e. I did nothing that was worthy of Death or of Bonds, the <HI>former</HI> I was in great Danger of, the <HI>latter</HI> I actually experienced; when at the &s;ame Time I ought to have been &s;et at Liberty. I have Rea&s;on to think twenty four Hours more would have put an End to my Life, for I had catch'd a prodigious Cold the fir&s;t Night, as the Wind blew hard in upon me the whole Time; and had that been the Ca&s;e, <HI>what Satisfaction</HI> could have been made to injur'd Innocence? Would it have been any Mitigation, becau&s;e it was done by the Repre&s;entatives of the People, or at lea&s;t by a Number of them? No! the Crime would have been &s;o much the more aggravated, as it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed they were ignorant of what they were doing, though I have &s;o much Charity as to think that <HI>forty Men of &s;uperior Sen&s;e then &s;etting,</HI> would &s;ooner have <HI>cut off</HI> their Hands than been
<PB N="25" REF="007418_0024_102D836D02219BC8">
guilty of &s;uch a <HI>ba&s;e Action;</HI> but &s;uppo&s;e mo&s;t Votes carried it.</P>
<P>After I was deliver'd from this doleful, melancholly Stink|ing Place, into Mr. <HI>Young's</HI> Dwelling Hou&s;e, I had a par|ticular Account of the Doctor's attending my Wife, who on this Occa&s;ion, was thrown into <HI>Fainting Fits,</HI> and <HI>He&s;|terick Di&s;orders,</HI> of which perhaps &s;he may never recover &s;o as to be the &s;ame Woman as before. Here is a further Ag|gravation of this <HI>unprecedented Conduct</HI> of tho&s;e who had no Right to put me there, as I hope I &s;hall be able to prove&mdash;The whole Time &s;he was <HI>forbid Admittance,</HI> who would willingly have kept with me: How then mu&s;t this appear to a thinking Mind, that the dearer Part of a Man's Self mu&s;t be as it were torn from him, which <HI>God had join'd together, and no Man had a Right to put a&s;under,</HI> excepting in &s;ome particular Ca&s;es, of which there can no Shadow of a Rea&s;on be pretended here. I could only hear while in Goal, the tender <HI>Cries of an aged Mother,</HI> for the Sight of her Son, the Interce&s;&s;ion of Friends for a Relief, and the encouraging Words of &s;ome to keep up a good Heart; and the Pity of the poor Melefactor, who &s;aid, he thought I was wor&s;e off than him&s;elf. Soon after I had got into the Pri&s;on-Keeper's Hou&s;e, being weak in Body, and &s;carcely able to walk, my dear Companion, with A&s;&s;i&s;tance, came in, who&s;e <HI>Palene&s;s and quivering Lips, with Trembling,</HI> was enough to move a Stoick. Here, I acknowlege, I want Words to paint this Scene in <HI>true and lively Colours;</HI> and as I imagine Language, were I capable, would only eclip&s;e a true Idea of it, &s;o I think nothing but a compleat Orator, a Ma&s;ter of Language, per|fectly acquainted with human Nature, <HI>can draw it to its Life;</HI> therefore &s;hall forbear.</P>
<P>The Day being now far &s;pent, and my Friends taking their Leave, I retired to a Chamber, and went to Re&s;t as &s;oon as I could; having a tolerable Night's Refre&s;hment, I awoke with con&s;iderable Strength of Body, heard two Ser|mons preach'd to the poor Melefactor; as there was a Num|ber of Per&s;ons came to &s;ee the Pri&s;oner on this Occa&s;ion, there was Enquiry, <HI>how I came out.</HI> I al&s;o heard the Hou&s;e had &s;ent for the <HI>Mittemus</HI> on Saturday, and that the Sheriff
<PB N="26" REF="007418_0025_102D836F2ABB3198">
would not give up the Orignal, for I was not under Bonds, nor any Body for me, that I &s;hould not depart the Pri&s;on-Yard; and the Doors and Gates being <HI>frequently open</HI> I had opportunity enough to go out, but being determin'd to &s;how no Contempt of Authority, nor any other Orders, am now, on Monday, (October 28.) &s;till confin'd waiting for the Plea&s;ure of the Hon. Hou&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Having had my Trial before the Lower Hou&s;e, and</HI> &s;u&s;pected <HI>to be guilty, on Tue&s;day the fifth Day after Confinement, it was "Ordered,</HI> that <HI>Daniel Fowle</HI> be brought to the Bar of the Hou&s;e, and Reprimanded by the Speaker, for his publi&s;h|ing a Scandalous Libel, called, <HI>the Mon&s;ter of Mon&s;ters,</HI> greatly reflecting upon the Honour of this Hou&s;e; and then be di&s;charged, <HI>paying Co&s;ts.</HI>
<P>The &s;aid <HI>Daniel Fowle</HI> was accordingly brought to the Bar of the Hou&s;e, and Reprimanded by the Speaker.</P>
<P><HI>Ordered,</HI> That Mr. Speaker i&s;&s;ue his Warrant to the Keeper of his Maje&s;ty's Goal, in the County of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> to di&s;charge the &s;aid <HI>Daniel Fowle</HI> upon his paying Co&s;t. Which was i&s;&s;ued by Mr. Speaker accordingly.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>This Affair, I under&s;tand, is the chief Topick of Conver|&s;ation in Town, and well it may be, for it is a new Thing in the Land. As I live under the Con&s;titution of <HI>England,</HI> &s;hall tran&s;cribe a few Thoughts out of that approved Piece, entitled the <HI>Spirit of Laws,</HI> Vol. 1. P. 216, and &s;o on.&mdash;</P>
<P>"The Liberty of the Subject is a Tranquility of Mind, ari&s;ing from the Opinion each Per&s;on hath of his Safety. In order to have this Liberty, it is requi&s;ite the Government be &s;o con&s;tituted as <HI>one Man</HI> need not be <HI>afraid of another."</HI></P>
<P>When the Legi&s;lative and Executive Powers are <HI>united, in the &s;ame Per&s;on,</HI> or in the &s;ame <HI>Body of Magi&s;trates,</HI> there can be <HI>no Liberty;</HI> becau&s;e Apprehen&s;ions may ari&s;e, lea&s;t the &s;ame Monarch or Senate &s;hould enact <HI>tyrannical Laws,</HI> to execute them in a tyrannical Manner."</P>
<P>"Again, There is <HI>no Liberty,</HI> if the <HI>Power of judging</HI> be not <HI>&s;eparated</HI> from the Legi&s;lative and Executive Powers. Were it join'd with the Legi&s;lative, the Life and Liberty of

<P>"There would be <HI>an End of every Thing,</HI> were the <HI>&s;ame Man,</HI> or the <HI>&s;ame Body,</HI> whether of the Nobles or of the People, to exerci&s;e tho&s;e three Powers, that of <HI>enacting Laws,</HI> that of <HI>executing the Publick Re&s;olutions,</HI> and that of <HI>judging the Crimes</HI> or Differences of Individuals."</P>

that they are not in&s;cribed in CAPITALS, in all our <HI>Courts</HI> of <HI>Judicature, Town-Halls</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>publick Edifices;</HI> they be|ing &s;o e&s;&s;ential to our Engli&s;h Freedom and Liberties, and becau&s;e my <HI>Lord Coke</HI> in the &s;econd Part of his <HI>In&s;titutes,</HI> has many excellent Ob&s;ervations on this Chapter; I &s;hall recite his very Words;</P>
<P><HI>That no free Man &s;hall be taken, or impri&s;oned, but by the Law of the Land,</HI> i. e. by the Common Law, or by the Statute Law, for the <HI>Liberty</HI> of a <HI>Man's Per&s;on</HI> is more dear to him than any Thing, and therefore if he be <HI>wronged</HI> in the Liberty, 'tis very rea&s;onable be &s;hould be relieved.</P>
<P><HI>No Man &s;hall di&s;&s;ei&s;ed,</HI> i. e. put out of Sei&s;in or be di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of his Freehold, i. e. of his <HI>Lands</HI> or <HI>Tenements,</HI> or <HI>Live|lihood,</HI> or of his <HI>Liberties,</HI> or <HI>Free-Cu&s;toms,</HI> which belong to him as his <HI>Birth-right,</HI> unle&s;s it be by Lawful Judgment, i. e. by a Verdict of his Equals, or Men of his own Condition, or by the <HI>Law of the Land,</HI> i. e. to &s;peak once for all, <HI>by the due Cour&s;e and Proce&s;s of Law.</HI></P>
<P><HI>No Man &s;hall be taken,</HI> &amp;c. i. e. re&s;trained of his Liberty, by Petition, or Sugge&s;tion, to the King or Council, unle&s;s it be by Indictment or Pre&s;entment, of good and lawful Men, living near the Place where &s;uch Deeds were done. The Warrant or <HI>Mittimus,</HI> containing a Lawful Cau&s;e, ought to have a Lawful Conclu&s;ion, &amp;c. and him &s;afely to keep until he be delivered by Law, &amp;c. and <HI>not</HI> until the <HI>Party commit|ting</HI> &s;hall farther Order.</P>

If the Impartial &s;hould think upon peru&s;ing the foregoing, that I have wrote with any unbecoming Pa&s;&s;ion or Prejudice, I am willing to acknowlege it. But at the &s;ame Time mu&s;t ob&s;erve, to u&s;e the Words of an excellent Writer, "All <HI>Anger</HI> or <HI>Re&s;entment</HI> cannot be condemned, although there is little lovely in any Degree of it. An intire In&s;en&s;ibility of <HI>all injuries,</HI> of which there are but few In&s;tances, would be a very inconvenient Di&s;po&s;ition; expo&s;ing a Man to the Con|turnelies and Petulance of others; nor con&s;i&s;tent with his own Character."</P>
<P>Is it not very &s;urpri&s;ing, &s;uch a Vote &s;hould pa&s;s that Hou&s;e, when I declar'd the Book was not of my printing, neither had I any &s;uch Types to print with? If it be &s;aid it was put to Vote, and there was a Majority for my Committment, and Mr. Speaker was ordered to &s;ign a Mittemus to put me into the Common Goal, I think he might with as much Propriety have &s;ign'd my <HI>Death Warrant</HI> if order'd. If it then be &s;aid, Mr. Speaker was again&s;t this Proceeding, could he not in a genteel Manner have excu&s;ed him&s;elf, and de&s;ired the Hou&s;e to appoint another for this Ca&s;e, and con&s;idered if he did me Wrong, though by their Influence, or Order, it would not excu&s;e him, unle&s;s they had an ab&s;olute Power to take away Life at Plea&s;ure&mdash;[I here &s;hall in&s;ert that Pa&s;&s;age in the Engli&s;h Liberties, Pag. 3. "'Tis true the Law it&s;elf affirms, the King can do no Wrong; which proceeds not only from a Pre&s;umption, that &s;o excellent a Per&s;on will do none, but al&s;o becau&s;e he acts nothing but by Mini&s;ters, which (from the lowe&s;t to the highe&s;t) are an&s;werable for their Doings; &s;o that if a King in his Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould command <HI>A</HI> to kill <HI>B,</HI> without Proce&s;s of Law, <HI>A</HI> may yet be pro&s;ecuted by Indictment, or upon an Appeal, (where no Royal Pardon is allowable) and mu&s;t for the &s;ame be executed, &s;uch Command notwith|&s;tanding."] Would he in Fact have done it, had I been his Son in Law, though ordered by the whole General A&s;&s;embly? No I dare &s;ay, he would not; and he certainly mu&s;t know, or at lea&s;t ought to know, in order to qualify him for that Office, I was not dealt with in a <HI>due Cour&s;e and Proce&s;s of Law;</HI> and that their Power did not extend, in &s;uch Ca&s;es to

any but their own Members. All I 'de&s;ir'd was a fair Trial at Common Law, which I doubt not is founded upon Rea|&s;on; and if I had been condemn'd, would have endeavoured to be calm and ea&s;y, and thrown them in the Heap of Mi&s;|fortunes Mankind are &s;ubject to.</P>
<P>If this was a ju&s;t Method of Proceeding, why was not the other Printers &s;ent for, and again&s;t whom Warrants were i&s;&s;ued?

Nay, would any of them have carried the Affair to &s;uch a mon&s;trous Heighth with a Relation or an Acquaintance? Would Mr. Speaker have &s;ign'd that Mittimus had I been nearly allied to his Family? It is unaccountable, that a Gen|tleman, who for &s;everal Years has had almo&s;t the unanimous Vote of this Town to repre&s;ent them, &s;hould act thus, when he mu&s;t know our Liberties Were <HI>touch'd to the Quick;</HI> (for I would not in the lea&s;t imagine he could be IGNORANT) and that the plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch a Precedent would be this: If I can be <HI>&s;ecure,</HI> or <HI>protected,</HI> I will do all in my Power to put every Man into the Stone Goal that &s;hall pretend either directly or indirectly to find Fault with the Conduct of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, while I am Speaker, even if they <HI>barely &s;u&s;pected;</HI> and whatever they order, I will &s;ign, and we will be Judges of <HI>Parallels</HI> and <HI>Innuendoes,</HI> though we &s;hould incur the Cen&s;ure of <HI>Juvenal,</HI> who &s;ays, "There are a <HI>Sett of Creature</HI> Who have <HI>no Mercy on Pa|per,</HI> and are ready to <HI>an&s;wer,</HI> even when they are <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> Strangers to the <HI>Subject."</HI></P>
<P>Strange! That Men who have had Liberty and Property continuallly &s;ounding in their Ears from the Pre&s;s and Pul|pit; even from their Infancy, &s;hould be guilty of this unac|countable Conduct?
