<P>LOOKING-GLASS FOR THE PRESBYTERIANS at NEW-LONDON; To &s;ee their Wor&s;hip and Wor&s;hippers weighed in the Balance, and found wanting.</P>
<P>With a true Account of what the People called Ro|gerenes, have &s;uffered in that Town from the 10th of June 1764, to the 13th of December 1766. Who &s;uffered for te&s;tifying, That it was con|trary to Scripture for Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel to teach for hire. That the Fir&s;t Day of the Week was no Sabbath by God's Appointment. That &s;prinkling Infants is no Bapti&s;m, and nothing &s;hort of Bla&s;phemy, being contrary to the Example &s;et us by Chri&s;t and his holy Apo&s;tles. That long Public Prayers in Synagogues is forbidden by Chri&s;t. Al&s;o for reproving their Church and Mi|ni&s;ter, for their great Pride, Vain-Glory, and Friend&s;hip of the World which they lived in.

<HEAD>A <HI>LOOKING-GLASS,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WE had been many times to the meeting-hou&s;e at New-London, to put the mi|ni&s;ter and people in mind how contrary their wor&s;hip was to the &s;criptures, and that it was not the wor&s;hip of God. But we could never per&s;uade the mini&s;ter nor congregation to &s;top and hear what we had to &s;ay concerning the&s;e articles above-mentioned, their deeds being evil, as Chri&s;t &s;aid, John iii. 20, 21. <HI>Every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved. But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manife&s;t that they are wrought in God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 10, 1764. We went to the meeting-hou&s;e at New-London, and &s;ome of our people went into the hou&s;e and &s;et down, others tarried without, and &s;at upon the ground &s;ome di&s;tance from the hou&s;e. And when Mather Byles, their prie&s;t, began to &s;ay over his formal &s;ynagogue prayer, forbidden by Chri&s;t, Matt. vi. 5. &amp;c. &s;ome of our women began to knit, others to &s;ew, that it might be made manife&s;t they had no fel|low&s;hip with &s;uch unfruitful works of darkne&s;s. But ju&s;tice Coit and the congregation were much offended at this te&s;timony, and fell upon them in the very time of their prayer, and pretended divine wor|&s;hip; al&s;o they fell upon all the re&s;t of our people that were &s;etting quietly in the hou&s;e, making no difference between them that tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed their law, and them that tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed it not; for they drove us all out of the hou&s;e in a mo&s;t furious manner; pu&s;h|ing,
<PB N="4" REF="010756_0003_0F8173FE073F7418">
&s;triking, kicking, &amp;c. &s;o that the meeting was broken up for &s;ome con&s;iderable time, and the hou&s;e in great confu&s;ion: Moreover they fell upon our friends that were &s;etting abroad, &s;triking and kicking both men and women, old and young, driving all of us to pri&s;on in a furious and tumultuous manner, &s;topping our mouths when we went to &s;peak, choak|ing us, &amp;c. So Ju&s;tice Coit committed us to pri&s;on, to lie there until the evening of the next day, and then to be &s;et at liberty without a trial. Now let us try the&s;e wor&s;hippers by the &s;criptures, and &s;ee if they be wor&s;hippers of the true God: For Chri&s;t &s;aith, Matt. vii. 18. &amp;c. <HI>a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, and by their fruits ye &s;hall know them,</HI> Thus it appears by Chri&s;t's own mouth, that it is an evil tree that brings forth evil fruit: Al&s;o the &s;cripture &s;aith, 1 Cor. xiii. 4. <HI>Charity &s;uffereth long, and is kind.</HI> Ver&s;e 5, <HI>Is not ea&s;ily provoked.</HI> Ver&s;e 7. <HI>Beareth all things, endureth all things.</HI> Now it is evident by this text, that this church notwith&s;tanding all her pretend|ed &s;olemn prayers and outward pretences of wor&s;hip|ping God, had not charity, which is the love of God, For they could not bear all things, endure all things, but were ea&s;ily provoked, and the corrupt fruit the&s;e pretended Chri&s;tians brought forth, even in the very time of their mo&s;t &s;olemn devotion, manife&s;ted that which lay hid in their in&s;ide, according to Chri&s;t's te&s;timony of &s;uch a generation. Matt. xxiii. 27, 28. <HI>Woe unto you &s;cribes and phari&s;ees, hypocrites, for ye are like unto whited &s;epulchres, which indeed appear beauti|ful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanne&s;s. Even &s;o ye al&s;o outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocri&s;y and iniquity.</HI> Al&s;o the &s;cripture &s;aith, 1 Cor. i. 25, &amp;c. <HI>The fooli&s;hne&s;s of God is wi&s;er than men, and the weak|ne&s;s of God is &s;tronger than men.</HI> And that God hath
<PB N="5" REF="010756_0004_0F8173FF7AE46A80">
cho&s;en the fooli&s;h, weak and ba&s;e things of the world, and things which are de&s;pi&s;ed, to confound the wi&s;e and mighty, that no fle&s;h &s;hould glory in his pre&s;ents. And thus it appeared, for the weakne&s;s and fooli&s;h|ne&s;s of the cro&s;s in the&s;e women's knitting and &s;ewing, proved &s;tronger and wi&s;er than all the worldly wi&s;dom and &s;trength of that church, for it &s;tripped their wor|&s;hip naked, and left their painted hypocri&s;y without any covering, and the in&s;ide of the&s;e whited &s;epul|chres appeared to be as the &s;cripture &s;aith, Rev. xviii. 2. <HI>The habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul &s;pirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.</HI></P>
<P>The next fir&s;t day of the week we went among them again, to warn them to for&s;ake their fal&s;e wor|&s;hip, pride, &amp;c. But ju&s;tice Coit being very angry at our coming, fell upon us in a furious manner, as he did the week before, &s;triking and kicking both men and women, &s;etting an example to the re&s;t of the people, &s;o he committed us to pri&s;on, to lie there two days, and then to be &s;et at liberty in the evening without a trial. But we con&s;tantly came among them every fir&s;t day of the week, to witne&s;s again&s;t their fal&s;e wor&s;hip, and to warn them to flee from the wrath to come.</P>
<P>But the authority and mini&s;ter, and &s;ome of the people were greatly offended at our oppo&s;ing their fal&s;e wor&s;hip; for they carried on their wor&s;hip in &s;uch pride, and &s;o contrary to the holy &s;criptures, that they could no ways defend it by the &s;cripture, and therefore took another way to defend it, never practi&s;ed by Chri&s;t or any of his followers. For ju&s;tice Coit, did continually fall upon us when we came among them, and drive us to pri&s;on, in an angry and furious manner; &s;ometimes twenty, &s;ometimes thirty in a day, &s;triking and kicking both men and women, pulling off women's caps and bon|nets,
<PB N="6" REF="010756_0005_0F81740060133650">
and tareing them to pieces with his hands, &s;et|ting and example to the re&s;t of the people: Al&s;o he made no difference between them that &s;poke at the meeting-hou&s;e again&s;t their wor&s;hip, and tho&s;e that did not &s;peak; for his con&s;tant practice was to fall upon all our friends that came to the meeting-hou&s;e, and all that he could &s;ee in &s;ight of the hou&s;e, and drive them to pri&s;on; he and his company, in a mo&s;t furious and tumultious manner, &s;topping their mouths when they went to &s;peak, choaking them, &amp;c. Al&s;o he doubled our impri&s;onment every time we came among them: but this method he took, added no peace to them, for &s;ome of our friends were always coming out of pri&s;on, as well as going in, and &s;o always ready to oppo&s;e their fal&s;e wor&s;hip every fir&s;t day of the week; and they found this &s;cripture ful|filled. I&s;aiah lvii. 21. <HI>There is no peace &s;aith my God to the wicked.</HI> However, this was the method they took, and after this manner they celebrated their &s;abbaths from the 10th of June, to the 12th of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>And then we pri&s;oners, &s;eeing ju&s;tice Coits's mob driving &s;ome of our friends before them, to commit them to pri&s;on for near four months, as appeared by his mittimus; and then to be &s;et at liberty in the evening, without a trial, for &s;o all his mittimu&s;es run: Then &s;even of us pri&s;oners having an opportunity, barred the out&s;ide pri&s;on door, and held them fa&s;t at the door, according to the example &s;et us by Eli&s;ha the prophet, 2 Kings, vi. 32. in &s;uch an unlawful ca&s;e; and in this we did not re&s;i&s;t the authority of the government, but a company of lawle&s;s men for ju&s;tice Coit (if he may be &s;o called) and his com|pany proceeded again&s;t us without any order of law: Al&s;o we blew a &s;hell in the pri&s;on, in defiance of their idol &s;abbath, and to mock their fal&s;e wor&s;hip,
<PB N="7" REF="010756_0006_0F81740102F4CE30">
as Elijah mocked the wor&s;hippers of Boal: 1 Kings, xviii. 27. But the authority, and a multitude of people &s;oon a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves together, at the pri&s;on, and the high &s;heriff demanded entrance, but we employed our&s;elves in exhorting the authority and people to repentance. The authority &s;eeing this, gave orders to break open the pri&s;on door; &s;o they went to work, and laboured exceeding hard on their &s;abbath, cutting with axes, and heaving at the door with iron bars for a con&s;iderable time, till they were wearied, but could not break open the door. Then ju&s;tice Coit and a great company with him, went up to the garret window by a ladder, and got into the garret, and laboured very hard for &s;ome con|&s;iderable time to cut away a very thick &s;trong trap door, full of iron &s;pikes; and after they had obtained their end, they came down among us, and took away our bibles, provi&s;ion, bedding, and every thing they could find: Al&s;o they committed their pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>About two days after this, we were taken out of pri&s;on and brought before ju&s;tice Coit, and two other ju&s;tices, who required bonds of us for good behaviour; but we refu&s;ed to give &s;uch bonds, judg|ing we had not behaved ill, nor re&s;i&s;ted the authority of the government, in baring the pri&s;on door again&s;t Daniel Coit and his lawle&s;s company: &s;o they com|mitted us to pri&s;on, to lye there till November court; but they turned all the re&s;t of our friends out of pri&s;on, that ju&s;tice Coit had committed to pri&s;on in &s;uch an unlawful and mobbi&s;h manner. Now from this time to November court, when our friends went to the meeting-hou&s;e and witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t their wor&s;hip, or carted wood to the pri&s;oners on the fir&s;t day of the week, ju&s;tice Coit would fine them, and commit them to pri&s;on on judgments of court; but he doubled their impri&s;onment no more after they &s;topped the pri&s;on door.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="010756_0007_0F817401B76BAAF8">The 2d day of December, being the &s;econd week of the courts &s;etting, our friends that &s;topped the pri&s;on door, were carried to Norwich court and fined forty &s;hillings each, and about forty &s;hillings co&s;t was laid on each of them: Execution was given out, and their e&s;tates taken away to &s;atisfy the fine and charges: but the court ordered our friends to be &s;et at liberty, that ju&s;tice Coit had committed to pri&s;on on judgments of court: But after the court &s;et tho&s;e people at liberty, ju&s;tice Coit &s;ent executi|ons and took oxen, cows, and other e&s;tate from the&s;e people that he had &s;o long confined in pri&s;on, to &s;atisfy the fine and charges which he laid upon them when he fir&s;t committed them to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>After this impri&s;onment, ju&s;tice Adams undertook to &s;top our te&s;timony again&s;t their wor&s;hip, by con|fining us in his hou&s;e on the fir&s;t days of the week, when we came among them, and when their wor&s;hip was over he would &s;et us at liberty. This method he practi&s;ed for &s;ome con&s;iderable time. In his hou&s;e we many, times met with rough treatment. After this we were &s;everal times driven from the meeting-hou&s;e, into a &s;laughter-hou&s;e in a rigorous manner: One of the &s;electmen of the town, would beat our women with his hands, and rub dirt and dung in their faces, and force it into their mouths: but when their divine wor&s;hip, as they call it, was over they would &s;et us at liberty. But October 13, 1765, &s;ome of our friends was in the meeting-hou&s;e, and when the hired prie&s;t began to &s;ay over his carnal prayer, forbidden by our ble&s;&s;ed &s;aviour, Mat. vi. 5, &amp;c. &s;ome of our women being moved with zeal, &s;ewed with their needles, that it might be known they had no fellow&s;hip with &s;uch unfruitful works of darkne&s;s. Then ju&s;tice Coit drove them out of the hou&s;e, but he &s;aid the men might &s;et in the hou&s;e, if they would
<PB N="9" REF="010756_0008_0F81740319D2A050">
be orderly: then one of our men told him, that the prie&s;t had ordered our hats to be taken off, and that we could not have &s;o much fellow&s;hip with his carnal prayer, as to &s;et quietly without our hats: then the ju&s;tice ordered him to be taken care of. Upon this others &s;poke, and told the people their wor&s;hip was contrary to the &s;cripture, and therefore not the wor&s;hip of God: &s;o ju&s;tice Coit committed &s;ix of our friends to pri&s;on. October 15, they beat the drum through the &s;treet, and gathered the people of the town together, and took our friends out of pri&s;on, and whipped five of them publickly at the beat of the drum. When the fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;ufferers was taken out of pri&s;on to receive his &s;entence of whipping, the &s;heriff a&s;ked if any body would pay his fine for him: but he told the &s;heriff and people, he did not want any body to pay his fine; and then went to ju&s;tice Coit, and told him that their wor&s;hip was the wor&s;hip of devils: and when he had received ten &s;evere &s;tripes, and was untied from the po&s;t, he told ju&s;tice Coit again, that their wor&s;hip was the wor&s;hip of devils, and that God would overthrow it.</P>
<P>The next fir&s;t day of the week, ju&s;tice Coit com|mitted twelve more of our friends to pri&s;on for the like te&s;timony. October 23, they were taken out of pri&s;on, and nine of them publickly whipped, at the beat of the drum, and then committed to pri&s;on again: But &s;oon after the pri&s;on keeper was &s;ent to bring them out, one by one, with their bedding and other goods; but the &s;heriff &s;tood in the lower entry, and as they came out he took away all their goods from them that he could find, without making any demand, or &s;howing any execution.</P>
<P>The next fir&s;t day of the week, we went into the meeting-hou&s;e again, and one of our friends went up to ju&s;tice Coit's pew, and told him that he had
<PB N="10" REF="010756_0009_0F817403C7A8BD38">
whipped us twice for te&s;tifying again&s;t their fal&s;e wor&s;hip, and that now we were come again in the &s;ame te&s;timony: for what Chri&s;t tells us in darkne&s;s, he requires us to &s;peak in the light; and what we hear in the ear, to proclaim upon the hou&s;e tops, and not to fear them that kill the body: moreover he told the people that their wor&s;hip was not the wor&s;hip of God, and that God was about to overthrow it. For the&s;e, and other words &s;poken by our friends again&s;t their wor&s;hip, ju&s;tice Coit committed eight of us to pri&s;on. November 1, he &s;entenced &s;even of the&s;e people to be publickly whipt, but committed them to pri&s;on again, and deferred their puni&s;hment to the 4th of November.</P>
<P>The next fir&s;t day of the week, three of our men went into the meeting-hou&s;e, and boldly witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t their fal&s;e wor&s;hip, pride, &amp;c. November 4th, the&s;e three men were &s;entenced to be publickly whipped, and then committed to pri&s;on, with the other &s;even; and &s;oon after they were taken out, and nine of them whipped.</P>
<P>There was among the&s;e pri&s;oners, an old woman near about &s;eventy years of age, that had been pub|lickly whipped the week before, at the beat of the drum, and was &s;entenced to be whipped this time, but was not whipped; it was &s;uppo&s;ed her fine was paid by &s;ome of the &s;pectators. She &s;eeing her friends and children taken out of pri&s;on, one by one, and tied to the po&s;t and whipped before her eyes, &s;he &s;ung this ver&s;e:
<Q><L>Let God ari&s;e, and then his foes</L>
<L>Shall turn them&s;elves to flight;</L>
<L>His enemies they al&s;o &s;hall</L>
<L>Be driven out of &s;ight.</L></Q>
There was one of the&s;e &s;ufferers that was taken out of pri&s;on to receive his &s;entence of whipping, who
<PB N="11" REF="010756_0010_0F817404DF6A05D0">
was comforted with the&s;e words, <HI>The name of the Lord is a &s;trong tower, the righteous runneth therein and are &s;afe.</HI></P>
<P>There was another of the&s;e &s;ufferers after he had received ten &s;evere blows on his naked body, turned about and told the people, he hoped he &s;hould be more full in his te&s;timony again&s;t their fal&s;e wor&s;hip than he had been.</P>
<P>Another of the&s;e &s;ufferers after his &s;econd public whipping, te&s;tified to the people at the po&s;t, that it was the true God and eternal life that was with him in his te&s;timony and &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>The next fir&s;t day of the week, after our third whipping, being the 10th of November, a guard was &s;et to keep us from the meeting-hou&s;e, yet two of our men e&s;caped the guard, and went into the hou&s;e, and boldly declared again&s;t their fal&s;e wor&s;hip, and ju&s;tice Coit committed them to pri&s;on. Novem|ber 14, being their pretended thank&s;giving day, one of our friends went into the meeting-hou&s;e, and told the people, God would not hear their prayers &s;o long as they lived in &s;uch pride, and per&s;ecuted God's children: but ju&s;tice Coit ordered a con&s;table to take care of him; and after their wor&s;hip was over, about eight or ten men came out from their wor&s;hip, among which was ju&s;tice Coit's &s;on William, and two of the high &s;heriff's &s;ons, and took him out of a hou&s;e, and the ju&s;tice's &s;on laid hold on him, and &s;aid, "come you dog, you &s;hall go along with us:" So they carried him to a place of muddy water, and threw him into it &s;everal times: al&s;o they threw mud and dirt in his face, and upon him for &s;ome time: But he te&s;tified to the&s;e wicked men, when they had him in the water, that he felt a peaceable quiet &s;pirit, which they could not di&s;turb. After this he was carried by the &s;heriff's hou&s;e, where ju&s;tice Coit was,
<PB N="12" REF="010756_0011_0F8174058E127678">
who had a mittimus ready, and committed him to pri&s;on, in that wet and dirty condition.</P>
<P>The next fir&s;t day of the week, being the 17th of November, &s;ome of our friends went through the town, and an old man aged about 73 years, cryed repentance through the &s;treet, and as he went, he &s;topped at the authorities hou&s;es, and warned them of the danger they were in, if they did not repent of their per&s;ecuting God's people: moreover he told them, that the cries of God's &s;uffering children was gone up before God, and that the Lord Je&s;us was coming with ten thou&s;ands of &s;aints to execute judg|ment upon all their ungodly deeds. Now after they had gone through the town, they went to the meet|ing-hou&s;e about the time that they were gathered together for their forenoon meeting; but the people at the meeting-hou&s;e fell upon our friends in a very angry manner, and drove them into the &s;chool-hou&s;e by ju&s;tice Coit's order, and a con&s;table kept the door, and confined them there: and in the evening a very great concour&s;e of people, both men and women came together to the &s;chool-hou&s;e, and our friends were taken out, one by one, both men and women, and their heads and cloaths were tarred with warm tar: al&s;o they rubbed tar in &s;ome of their eyes, which was very grievous: al&s;o they put tar into their hats, and put them on their heads: moreover they threw &s;ome of our friends into a ditch of water, and rolled them over, jumping upon them with their feet.</P>
<P>After this they took one of our friends that had been much abu&s;ed that day, and one of his ribs bro|ken by a Grand-Juryman, and forced him to the river and threw him in: Now he te&s;tified to the&s;e wicked men whil&s;t they were abu&s;ing him, that he had a good con&s;cience both towards God and man:
<PB N="13" REF="010756_0012_0F81740637D64020">
Some of the&s;e people thus u&s;ed, were elderly people, that had great families of children and grand-chil|dren; and there is no doubt but this abu&s;e was done to them by order of authority. Thus their pretended holy &s;abbath and divine wor&s;hip ended for that day: <HI>By their fruits, &s;aith Chri&s;t, ye &s;hall know them.</HI> Some time after this we were confined in the &s;chool-hou&s;e again, and one of our friends wrote upon the &s;chool-ma&s;ter's &s;late as follows.</P>
<Q><L>Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, for &s;inners &s;akes,</L>
<L>A crown of thorns did wear;</L>
<L>Why then &s;hould we a&s;hamed be,</L>
<L>A crown of tar to bear.</L></Q>
<P>The next fir&s;t day of the week after our friends was tarred, we went to the meeting-hou&s;e again; but they carried us away from the meeting-hou&s;e to the &s;chool-hou&s;e, and confined us there till their meet|ing was over, and then &s;et us at liberty. The next day, being the 25th of November, the&s;e three men before mentioned, were taken out of pri&s;on and brought before Ju&s;tice Coit. And he took up the writ he had again&s;t them, and read part of it and laid it down on the table, and a&s;ked them if they owned what they were charged with in that writ; they an|&s;wered they did own it; and they told the Ju&s;tice more that they &s;aid at the meeting-hou&s;e than he had got in his writ again&s;t them. Then ju&s;tice Coit &s;aid, What would you have us do? Then our friends told him they would have them get into the love of God, and get &s;uch a meek and lowly &s;pirit, as to be willing to hear the meane&s;t of God's children, and to be like our &s;aviour, who was &s;o meek and lowly in heart as to wa&s;h his di&s;ciple's feet. So after &s;ome con&s;iderable di&s;cour&s;e more, ju&s;tice Coit &s;et them at liberty, with|out inflicting any further puni&s;hment on them, tho' guilty of the like crime that he whipped us for ju&s;t

before, three weeks running, and twice at the beat of the drum.</P>
<P>The next fir&s;t day of the week, being the fir&s;t day of December, we went among them again, and were confined in the &s;chool-hou&s;e till their meeting was over, and then &s;et at liberty. But as we pa&s;&s;ed by the meeting-hou&s;e, ju&s;tice Coit's &s;on William, and the High-Sheriff's elde&s;t &s;on, and others with them, be&s;et us, and the ju&s;tice's &s;on &s;aid we de&s;erved to be crucified. Now after they had let us go, and we were &s;ome con&s;iderable di&s;tance from them, they pur|&s;ued after us to the upper end of the town, as men greedy after our blood, and indeed our lives have been threatened by that company; but when they came near to us they made a &s;top, and turned back.</P>
<P>February 2, 1766, &s;ome of our people were in the meeting-hou&s;e, and when the prie&s;t began to &s;ay over his pretended prayer, as Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>for a pretence they make long prayers,</HI> &s;ome of our women &s;ewed with their needles: Then they turned them out of the hou&s;e, but one of them went in again, and told the prie&s;t, that his prayers were a &s;moke in God's no&s;e, a fire that burns all the day long. Then they turned her out again, and &s;he went to the back &s;ide of the hou&s;e, and &s;truck again&s;t the hou&s;e &s;everal times, &s;till to te&s;tify again&s;t his pretended prayer, that it might be declared upon the hou&s;e-tops, that &s;he had no fel|low&s;hip with &s;uch unfruitful works of darkne&s;s, and &s;he &s;aid &s;he had a good con&s;cience and boldne&s;s towards God in what &s;he did, knowing &s;he plea&s;ed God in it: But though &s;he did it in a great &s;elf-denial, for no other end but to plea&s;e God, yet &s;ome of the people ran out and fell upon her, and one of the Select-men of the town &s;truck her &s;everal hard blows on her head and face, by which &s;he was much hurt.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="010756_0014_0F81740B264F2100">February 9, one of our women told the prie&s;t as he was in the pulpit, that God would reprove his great pride, and &s;et his &s;ins in order before his face: For the&s;e words &s;he was committed to pri&s;on for &s;eve|ral days, and then &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>February 16, &s;ome of our friends were &s;etting quietly in the meeting-hou&s;e, between meetings, and Colonel Saltan&s;tall came in, and laid hold of an old man that had the numb pal&s;y, aged 73 years, and with great violence hauled him out of the &s;eat, &s;etting an example to others, who fell upon them and drove them out of the hou&s;e, and drove them to the court-hou&s;e in a furious manner, and carried them up thro' a trap-door into a dark garret, and locked them in, and at night a company of ba&s;e men got together, among which was Dudley Saltan&s;tall, &s;on to Colonel Saltan&s;tall, and two of ju&s;tice Adams's &s;ons, and two of the High-Sheriff's &s;ons, and Daniel Hurlbut, &s;on to Titus Hurlbut one of the Selectmen of the town. This ba&s;e company went into the court-hou&s;e and &s;hut them&s;elves in, and took our friends out of the garret, and offered &s;hameful abu&s;e to our women in the dark. Now one of the&s;e women, as they were taking her down out of the garret through the trap-door, told them, that the Lord would come with ten thou&s;ands of his &s;aints to execute judgment upon all their ungodly deeds; her hu&s;band hearing this, cried out to the people of the town, that the Sodomites had got his wife. Another of the&s;e women as they were hauling her down through the trap door, cried all the while, Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t deliver me; and no doubt God heard her prayers and the prayers of the re&s;t, for the women were delivered in that they feared. Now after this &s;hameful abu&s;e to the women, they took two men and &s;tripped of their cloaths and tied them to a po&s;t in the court-hou&s;e, and whipped them
<PB N="16" REF="010756_0015_0F81740B777B04A8">
in a mo&s;t unmerciful manner, e&s;pecially one of them, which they &s;truck unmerciful blows with a &s;taff and with bunches of rods on his back, till it was like a jelly, al&s;o they rubbed tar into their wounds, and whipped upon the tar, forcing it into their fle&s;h; al&s;o they rubbed tar in the mouths of the men and women when they went to &s;peak. When the&s;e two men were fir&s;t tied to the po&s;t they &s;ang prai&s;es to God, and in the time of their torment, they called upon God to &s;trengthen them.</P>
<P>After this they laid hold on the&s;e two men, and forced them to run down near to the town wharf, and threw them into the water &s;everal times; al&s;o they took their hats and threw water on them for &s;ome con&s;iderable time: moreover they threw the wo|men into the water. After this the &s;heriff's elde&s;t &s;on and another man with him, took a poor weakly woman, forty odd years of age, and forced her to run through the &s;treet till &s;he dropped down, and then they left her.</P>
<P>This woman told them if they did not repent, they would remember their night's work when they and all men mu&s;t appear before God to give an ac|count of their deeds. Now after this &s;hameful abu&s;e, the&s;e people had to go near three miles wet, in a cold winter night, before they could &s;hift their cloaths. This night's work &s;eems to exceed what was done by the Sodomites the night before their final overthrow.</P>
<P>Thus their pretended divine wor&s;hip and holy &s;abbath ended for that day; I&s;aiah iii. 9. <HI>The &s;hew of their countenance doth witne&s;s again&s;t them, and they declare their &s;in as Sodom, they hide it not.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Their wor&s;hip is by Sodomites maintain'd,</L>
<L>By cruelties their wor&s;hip is &s;u&s;tain'd;</L>
<L>No &s;ons of Sodom ever yet were known,</L>
<L>Chri&s;t's truth to favour, or his wor&s;hip own.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="17" REF="010756_0016_0F81740C450051B8">Now the next fir&s;t day of the week, after Colonel Saltan&s;tall &s;hut our friends up in the court-hou&s;e, and &s;et his &s;on Dudley, and others to abu&s;e them, it being the 23d of February, we were coming to the meeting-hou&s;e again, but as &s;oon as we appeared in &s;ight, Colonel Saltan&s;tall run out and met us, and a great company with him, and fell upon us in a very angry manner, before we had &s;poke one word, to drive us to the court-hou&s;e, as he did the week before, when our friends were &s;etting quietly in the hou&s;e between meetings. But as &s;oon as they fell upon us, we &s;poke and made a great noi&s;e, and re|fu&s;ed to go with them, telling them we cho&s;e to be killed publickly before the people, rather than to be murdered privately in the court-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Now the tumult grew very great, &s;o that the meeting was broken up for &s;ome con&s;iderable time, and they dragged both men and women on the ground to the court-hou&s;e; &s;ome by their hands, &s;ome by their legs, and &s;ome by the hair of their heads, &s;trik|ing them with their fi&s;ts, kicking them, &s;triking and punching them with &s;taffs, and tearing the cloaths off from their backs, and they dragged them into the court-hou&s;e and hauled both men and women up two pair of &s;tairs, and hauled them up through a trap door into that dark loft that they had &s;hut our friends up in the week before, and they locked them in. In this tumult an aged woman was &s;o overcome that &s;he fainted away, and they left her lying on the ground. Now there were pre&s;ent in this riot, ju&s;tice Coit, ju&s;tice Adams, ju&s;tice Law, the High-Sheriff, and Col. Saltan&s;tall, be&s;ides con&s;tables and grand-jurymen: There was al&s;o a Deacon among them, which makes us write as follows.</P>
<Q><L>The deacon and the ju&s;tices</L>
<L>Were bu&s;y in this fray,</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="010756_0017_0F81740D077E6D30">Church members and grand-jurymen</L>
<L>Forgot their &s;abbath day.</L></Q>
<P>Now after the tumult was over, the&s;e church mem|bers remembered their &s;abbath, and returned to their pretended divine wor&s;hip again: But as &s;oon as that was over, the authority con&s;ulted together at the meeting-hou&s;e, and &s;ent the High-Sheriff, who came with a company of men, and took down ten women out of that dark loft that the authority had &s;hut them up in: Two of the&s;e women had young children with them, and another was big with child, and committed them to pri&s;on, leaving near twenty &s;mall children motherle&s;s at their homes. Now as the High-Sheriff was going from the meeting-hou&s;e, to commit the&s;e women to pri&s;on, &s;ome of the people of the town a&s;ked him what they were going to do with our friends; the &s;heriff an&s;wered, that the wo|men were to be committed to pri&s;on, but he &s;aid the men were to be delivered up to Satan to be buffetted; &s;o the authority kept the men locked up in that dark garret till night, and then they were delivered up to the authority's children, and a rude company of young men, who came and unlocked the trap-door, and abu&s;ed our friends in the manner following: They took down one man fir&s;t out of this dark loft, and brought him down into the lower room of the court-hou&s;e, and tied his hands round a po&s;t, al&s;o they tied another line to his hands, and hoi&s;ted him up by a tackle, then they brought his knees round the po&s;t and tied them with a line, and &s;tripped his cloaths up over his head, and tied them al&s;o; then they whipped him in a very barbarous manner by the light of a candle. And when they had done tortur|ing him, they let him down, and &s;hut him up in one of the court-hou&s;e chambers. They then brought down another out of the garret, and tortured him
<PB N="19" REF="010756_0018_0F81740DED10A2E8">
after the &s;ame manner as they did the fir&s;t, and then &s;hut him up al&s;o, pretending they would whip them all over again, except they would recant and pro|mi&s;e not to come among them any more. There were twelve whippers that took turns to whip, and commonly three or four to whip one man, one after another, they pretended to give tho&s;e men thirty-nine &s;tripes each; but they u&s;ed &s;everal &s;orts of whips, e&s;|pecially one unmerciful in&s;trument made of cow-hide, al&s;o they whipped them with large rods tied together, &s;ome of which had ten in a bunch, &s;o that they far exceeded thirty-nine &s;tripes, for they &s;truck each per&s;on thirty-nine times with the&s;e cruel in&s;tru|ments, except one man, which after they had &s;truck him thirty unmerciful blows, one of the &s;pectators ran and untied him, telling the whippers he was an old man, and that they ought to u&s;e &s;ome di&s;cretion towards him. Nine men were thus u&s;ed this night, all heads of families, &s;ome of which were elderly men, that had great families of children.</P>
<P>This whipping was executed in a very barbarous manner, for the rods were trimmed, and long &s;harp &s;nags left on them, to tear the fle&s;h of the &s;ufferers, al&s;o the&s;e men that whipped our friends, &s;truck them in &s;uch a violent manner with the&s;e heavy bunches of rods, that they beat and brui&s;ed their fle&s;h till it was like a jelly. Moreover, &s;ome of their wri&s;ts were &s;o cut and their &s;inews &s;o much hurt with the line they hung by, that &s;everal of their hands were numb for more than two months after. Al&s;o them two men that had been &s;o unmercifully whipped by this company in the court-hou&s;e the week before, and otherwi&s;e abu&s;ed, as is already related, were of the&s;e nine that &s;uffered this night: And they &s;truck one of the&s;e men, he that had been the mo&s;t abu&s;ed the week before, forty-three cruel blows on his old &s;ores, and
<PB N="20" REF="010756_0019_0F81740ECF3BF2B8">
ten or twelve of the&s;e blows were after he was &s;woon|ed away. Our per&s;ecutors cut the&s;e rods, upon their &s;abbath, and fitted them at the court-hou&s;e, and Co|lonel Saltan&s;tall was at the court-hou&s;e among them, when they were preparing the&s;e rods.</P>
<P>The names of the men that whipped us are as fol|lows: Two of Colonel Saltan&s;tall's &s;ons, Dudley and Richard, al&s;o William Coit, &s;on to ju&s;tice Coit, two of ju&s;tice Adams's &s;ons, William and Pygan, two of the High-Sheriff Chri&s;topher's &s;ons, Chri&s;topher and Jo&s;eph, al&s;o Butolph Hurlbut, &s;on to Titus Harl|but, one of the &s;electmen of the town, al&s;o John Chapman and Gideon Stacey, John Spooner and John Waigh, &s;on to Thomas Waigh. Our friends that &s;uffered this night, a&s;ked no favour of their per&s;ecutors, but called earne&s;tly upon God to &s;trength|en them to go through their trial. But when their per&s;ecutors heard them praying and calling upon Chri&s;t for &s;trength, they would threaten them, and whip with all their might, endeavouring to make them promi&s;e to renounce their te&s;timony again&s;t their wor&s;hip, but were not able to make one of them renounce their te&s;timony, or make any promi&s;e at all: But the &s;ufferers told them to this effect, that what they did again&s;t their wor&s;hip was for no other end but to plea&s;e God and keep a good con&s;cience, and that if they &s;hould promi&s;e to renounce their te&s;ti|mony, God would renounce their &s;ouls for ever. Al&s;o when &s;ome of the&s;e men had &s;uffered this cruel whipping, and were &s;hut up in the court-hou&s;e cham|ber, they prayed earne&s;tly to God to &s;trengthen their brethren that were to &s;uffer, al&s;o they prayed for their per&s;ecutors, for God gave them a more than common love to tho&s;e that were tormenting them.</P>
<P>So after the&s;e nine men had &s;uffered they were &s;et at liberty, their per&s;ecutors threatened them to double
<PB N="21" REF="010756_0020_0F8174101E9F66B8">
their whipping every time they came to the meeting-hou&s;e among them. And no doubt they would have gone farther had not God prevented them by making a divi&s;ion among the people; the neighbouring towns crying out again&s;t &s;uch barbarous and unlawful be|haviour; al&s;o it was a common &s;aying among the people, that they were &s;orry their rulers had re&s;igned up their authority to a company of boys, and &s;et them to defend their wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>The 27th day of February the&s;e ten women before-mentioned, were taken out of pri&s;on and brought before ju&s;tice Coit, and he called that wicked com|pany together, that he and the re&s;t of the authority at New-London had ju&s;t before &s;et to abu&s;e our men. And in&s;tead of puni&s;hing them for abu&s;ing our friends, he made witne&s;&s;es of them again&s;t the&s;e women, and fined them forty &s;hillings each, and laid nine|teen &s;hillings co&s;t on each of them: Al&s;o he required bonds of good behaviour, pretending they had bro|ken the peace and &s;abbath in a high-handed manner, but they refu&s;ed to give &s;uch bonds: So ju&s;tice Coit committed them to pri&s;on to lie there till the court, which was to &s;et at Norwich the fifteenth of April: Yet there was not one of the&s;e women that &s;poke one word at the meeting-hou&s;e before Colonel Saltan&s;tall, and that wicked company fell upon them, and &s;ome of the&s;e women did not &s;peak after they fell upon them, only cried out under the abu&s;e they met with, by being dragged &s;uch a length of way on the ground, and hauled up two pair of &s;tairs, through a trap door into the court-hou&s;e garret, in &s;uch a cruel and inde|cent manner as has been already related. Now whether it was the&s;e women that were guilty of breaking the peace and &s;abbath in a high-handed manner, as is charged again&s;t them: Or whether it was ju&s;tice Coit and that company with him that abu&s;ed them at
<PB N="22" REF="010756_0021_0F817410B79F70E0">
the meeting hou&s;e, that was guilty of breaking the peace and &s;abbath in a high-handed manner, and of a riot al&s;o, we &s;hall leave to the judgment of the reader.</P>
<P>A particular account of the&s;e two la&s;t mobs, and of the&s;e ten women's impri&s;onment was laid before the county court at Norwich, April 15, 1766, the day that their bonds were up. But the authority at New-London kept all the&s;e women in pri&s;on till June court, except two, who were &s;et at liberty a few days before court, notwith&s;tanding their bonds were up the 15th of April. Now &s;even of the&s;e women were men's wives, &s;o that the authority could have no cloak of law for impri&s;oning them after their bonds were up.</P>
<P>The 10th day of June, being the fir&s;t day of the court's &s;etting, the&s;e women &s;ent a paper into court to inform the judges of their wrong impri&s;onment: And &s;ome days after one of our friends a&s;ked two of the judges, whether it was according to law to keep men's wives in pri&s;on upon executions.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day after this que&s;tion was put to the judges, two of the&s;e women were &s;et at liberty. One was the woman before mentioned, that was big with child when &s;he was committed to pri&s;on; her hu&s;band carried her home, and &s;he was delivered of a child within three hours after &s;he went out of the pri&s;on. A few days after three more were turned out of pri&s;on, and the 21&s;t day of June the la&s;t of the&s;e women were &s;et at liberty. Now the next fir&s;t day of the week, after the authority had &s;hut our friends up in the court-hou&s;e garret, and delivered them up to the young people to be abu&s;ed; we went into the meeting-hou&s;e, and Colonel Saltan&s;tall told us to take off our hats; but we told him it was a principle we held, and that we ought to have liberty to wear
<PB N="23" REF="010756_0022_0F817415CB313818">
our hats: But he &s;aid, we &s;hould not wear them in the time of divine wor&s;hip; &s;o he ordered our hats to be taken off, and we went out of the hou&s;e. Now how he can prove their wor&s;hip to be divine we know not: For it is certain their wor&s;hippers are very corrupt, and the fruits they bring forth very evil. The next fir&s;t day of the week we went into the meeting-hou&s;e again, and ju&s;tice Coit told us to take off our hats; but we in&s;i&s;ted hard upon wearing them. Then the prie&s;t &s;poke in the pulpit as follows: <HI>I &s;olemnly declare before God and this a&s;&s;embly, that as long as I officiate in the prie&s;t's office in this hou&s;e, no man &s;hall &s;it here with his head covered,</HI> and then &s;truck his hand hard upon the pulpit in confirmation of his words. So ju&s;tice Coit ordered our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> taken off, and we went out of the hou&s;e. Now our hats is &s;uch an offence to this proud prie&s;t, that he will neither preach nor pray when they are in &s;ight. And this has been often proved, and e&s;pecially one time not long &s;ince: When he &s;aw &s;ome of our friends &s;etting without the meeting-hou&s;e door on the &s;teps, he &s;top|ped in the mid&s;t of his &s;ervice, and &s;hut up his bible, and told the authority they were come again: But the authority &s;eemed to take but little notice of it, but the prie&s;t continued in&s;i&s;ting that they &s;hould be taken away from the door; and at la&s;t told the authority plainly, that if they did not order them away he would not preach to them; &s;o then the authority gave orders, and they moved them from the door.</P>
<P>But although this prie&s;t is &s;o offended at our hats, yet he is no ways offended at the authority and people for their cruel and unlawful behaviour to|wards us, all which he has publickly ju&s;tified: But the hat he cannot endure, pretending it is contrary to 1 Cor. xi. 4. <HI>Every man praying or prophecying hav|ing
<PB N="24" REF="010756_0023_0F81741710D9D3D8">
his head covered, di&s;honoureth his head.</HI> Now if this prie&s;t would but read the next words, he might &s;ee it to be as contrary to &s;cripture for women to pray or prophecy uncovered, yet his meeting is full of young women with their heads naked, but that gives him no offence at all, it is the fa&s;hion &s;o to dre&s;s. And if he would but read carefully what the apo&s;tle &s;aith about this covering, he might &s;ee that the apo&s;tle tells plainly him&s;elf, before he leaves the matter, what covering it is that he is treating of; as is to be &s;een in the 13th, 14th, and 15th ver&s;es of this chapter. <HI>Judge in your&s;elves, is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered: Doth not even nature it&s;elf teach you, that if a man have long hair it is a &s;hame unto him: But if a woman have long hair it is a glory unto her, for her hair is given her for a covering.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears that the apo&s;tle is &s;peaking of the hair, and not of any garment of the body: Al&s;o God commanded his mini&s;ters under the law, to cover their heads with a garment, when they came to mini&s;ter in his pre&s;ence, and not to wear long hair; as appears Ezek. xliv. 18, 20, <HI>They &s;hall have linnen bonnets upon their heads,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Nor &s;uffer their locks to grow long.</HI></P>
<P>April 13. Some of our friends were &s;etting in the meeting-hou&s;e, but when the prie&s;t came in he order|ed their hats to be taken off; when one of our friends, an old man, told him that he had &s;omething on his mind to &s;peak to the people, and would be glad to have him hear it: but the prie&s;t &s;aid he would hear nothing from him, and commanded the people to turn our friends out of the hou&s;e. But the prie&s;t &s;eeing the people very moderate, and unwilling to meddle with us, he &s;oon grew angry, and called to the young men in the galleries, and bid them come down and carry them fellows out of the hou&s;e: then
<PB N="25" REF="010756_0024_0F8174177A8CA9A8">
an aged woman of our company, being near the pul|pit, &s;poke to this effect, "Woe, woe to them "that wor&s;hip idols, and per&s;ecute God's people." The&s;e words &s;he repeated &s;undry times: &s;o they moved us out of the hou&s;e very moderately, and we went away.</P>
<P>We have lately &s;een a paragraph in a Bo&s;ton news papers, as follows: <HI>We hear the Sons of Liberty at New-London, have taken &s;uch methods with the &s;ect called Rogerenes, that they are prevented from di&s;turbing the wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;emblies in that neighbourhood on Lord's Day: a practice they have followed more or le&s;s, for many years pa&s;t; and which all the laws made in the government, and executed in the mo&s;t judicious manner, could not put a &s;top to.</HI></P>
<P>An&s;wer. As to what they have heard concerning our te&s;timony being prevented, is not to be credited, for we hear no &s;uch news at New-London, neither have we any rea&s;on to believe that our rulers at New-London, have gained either &s;trength or credit in delivering us up to the young people, and &s;etting them to abu&s;e us.</P>
<P>But they po&s;itively affirm in this news paper, that all the laws made in the government, and executed upon us for many years pa&s;t, could not put a &s;top to our te&s;timony or di&s;turbance as they call it.</P>
<P>This affirmation is true, and it is good proof that we are not like the &s;toney ground, &s;poken of Mat. xiii. 20, 21: but have digged deep, and laid our foundation on a rock; according as we read Luke vi. 48. and Mat. vii. 24, 25. Moreover we may con&s;ider that all the laws made in Rome for many years pa&s;t, and executed upon the prote&s;tants, could not put a &s;top to their te&s;timony: nor all the cruel and barba|rous laws made in Bo&s;ton government, and executed upon the people called Quakers, in the mo&s;t rigorous manner, and the righteous blood &s;hed in that govern|ment,

could not put a &s;top to the te&s;timony of that people.</P>
<P>Sept. 14, 1766. Some of our people went and &s;et down &s;ome di&s;tance from the prie&s;t's hou&s;e, and when he came out to go to meeting, they walked with him and endeavoured to have &s;ome friendly di&s;cour&s;e with him concerning the things of God: But the prie&s;t would not talk with them about the things of God. However, they walked with him and talked to him, but before they came to the meeting-hou&s;e, ju&s;tice Coit began to kick them in a furious manner, e&s;pe|cially the women. Al&s;o one of the town&s;men fell upon them, punching both men and women with a &s;taff in a cruel manner, &s;o they were driven by &s;ome of the people to the upper end of the town.</P>
<P>The next fir&s;t day of the week, being the 21&s;t of September, as &s;ome of us were &s;etting by the &s;ide of a hou&s;e, between meetings, about four or five rods from the prie&s;t's hou&s;e, &s;aying nothing to any per&s;on, the High-Sheriff came with &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tants and took us and &s;ent for ju&s;tice Coit, who came and committed eight men of us to pri&s;on. And on the 26th day of the &s;ame month, ju&s;tice Coit came to the pri&s;on, and we were taken out, and brought before him, and he charged us with di&s;turbing the mini&s;ter's peace: We told him we had no thought of doing the mini&s;ter any hurt: Ju&s;tice Coit an&s;wered, that he did not &s;uppo&s;e that we intended to &s;trike him or wre&s;tle with him, nor he did not &s;uppo&s;e that we intended to hurt a hair of his head; but he &s;uppo&s;ed that we intended when the mini&s;ter came out to go along by his his &s;ide and talk with him. So when ju&s;tice Coit had confe&s;&s;ed that he did not &s;uppo&s;e we intended to hurt a hair of the prie&s;t's head, he fined us five &s;hillings each, and requir|ed bonds of good behaviour towards all his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects; but e&s;pecially towards the prie&s;t. But we refu&s;ed to give &s;uch bonds, looking upon the judg|ment
<PB N="27" REF="010756_0026_0F817418F6C53998">
to be very ab&s;urd, and that ju&s;tice Coi&s;t's &s;up|po&s;ing that we intended to talk with the prie&s;t was not breach of peace in us, &s;o he committed &s;even of us to pri&s;on again, all heads of families, one of which men was in his &s;eventy-fifth year. Four of the&s;e men were kept in pri&s;on till the 13th of December follow|ing, and two were &s;et at liberty about the 28th of November, and one within a few days after we were committed to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Now after the&s;e men were committed to pri&s;on, our friends that were at liberty thought it nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome of our people &s;hould go on the fir&s;t days of the week and &s;et in the prie&s;t's &s;ight, and not fear them that per&s;ecute the body. But when the prie&s;t &s;aw them &s;itting in &s;ight, if it were but a few women, he would not come out of his hou&s;e to go to meeting, which manife&s;ted him to be a &s;hepherd that did not care for his &s;heep, according to Chri&s;t's te&s;timony, John x. 13. <HI>The hireling fleeth becau&s;e he is an hireling, and careth not for the &s;heep.</HI> Al&s;o this behaviour of the prie&s;t occa&s;ioned much trouble to his poor flock, for &s;ometimes the bell would ring and the people &s;et waiting for their prie&s;t till it was time for meeting to be half done: And then ju&s;tice Coit, or &s;ome of the re&s;t of his &s;heep were obliged to come and move the women out of the prie&s;t's &s;ight, and guard their &s;hepherd to the meeting-hou&s;e, le&s;t the&s;e women &s;hould &s;peak to him of the things of God.</P>
<P>It was almo&s;t every fir&s;t day of the week for the whole time of this impri&s;onment, which was near three months, that this &s;hepherd was kept in his hou&s;e by the &s;ight of our friends, and &s;ometimes only at the &s;ight of a few women, and he never ventured to come out till &s;ome of his &s;heep came and drove the women away. But ju&s;tice Coit committed no more of our friends to pri&s;on under bonds of good

behaviour, becau&s;e he &s;uppo&s;ed they intended to talk with the prie&s;t after the&s;e men abovementioned. But the 23d of November, one of our men told the prie&s;t after he was come out of the meeting-hou&s;e, that he came to put him in mind how they kept God's children in pri&s;on, and that their wor&s;hip was upheld by cruelty. The prie&s;t an&s;wered to this effect, that they could uphold it no other way. Then the man re|plied it mu&s;t certainly be of the devil if there is no other way to uphold it but by cruelty. But the &s;he|riff &s;truck him twice on his head, and punched him with his &s;taff to prevent his &s;peaking to the prie&s;t. And he and three women were committed to pri&s;on, but at night they were &s;et liberty. Some of our neighbours argue that they have built them a meet|ing-hou&s;e, and have a natural right to wor&s;hip in it; and that no per&s;on has any right to come into their hou&s;e and oppo&s;e their wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>But how they can maintain this argument we know not, except they deny God to have any authority over them, for God &s;aid, Jer. i. 7. <HI>Thou &s;hall go to all that I &s;hall &s;end thee, and what&s;oever I command thee thou &s;hall &s;peak.</HI> Al&s;o the apo&s;tle Paul exhorteth us to be followers of him as he was of Chri&s;t, 1 Cor. xi. 1. And Paul &s;pent much time in going from place to place, di&s;puting in the &s;ynagoues on the &s;ab|bath days, as appears in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles. And no doubt they built their &s;ynagogues, and thought as our neighbours do, that they had a na|tural right to wor&s;hip in them, and that the apo&s;tle had no right to oppo&s;e them in their wor&s;hip, for they were as much offended at the apo&s;tle as our neighbours are at us, for they called him a pe&s;tilent fellow, and &s;aid he was <HI>a mover of &s;edition throughout the world,</HI> Acts xxiv. 5. Al&s;o &s;peaking of Paul and

Silas, they &s;aid, Acts xvii. 6. <HI>The&s;e that have turned the world up &s;ide down, are come hither al&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>Now the rea&s;on that we oppo&s;e our neighbours in their wor&s;hip is, becau&s;e Chri&s;t hath enlightened us both by his &s;pirit and the &s;criptures, to &s;ee that their wor&s;hip is carried on in pride and in the vain glory of this world contrary to the &s;criptures, by the in&s;tigation of <HI>that old &s;erpent called the devil and &s;atan which deceiveth the whole world,</HI> Rev. xii. 9. And God's children are his witne&s;&s;es, I&s;aiah xliii. 12. <HI>Ye are my witne&s;&s;es &s;aith the Lord.</HI> And God requires his wit|ne&s;&s;es to be faithful and zealous in oppo&s;ing fal&s;e wor&s;hip; as appears both from the old te&s;tament and the new: for it was the work of God's children under the law to de&s;troy fal&s;le wor&s;hip: it was the &s;tatutes and judgments that God commanded them to ob&s;erve and do all the days that they lived on the earth: &s;ee Deut. xii. 1, &amp;c. It was I&s;arel's arrant out of Egypt, to de&s;troy the fal&s;e wor&s;hip of them kingdoms, as appears by the following &s;criptures; Exod. xxxiv. 10 to 18 ver&s;e. Exod. xxiii. 20 to 26. Deut. vii. 1 to 6 ver&s;e. Numb. xxxiii. 50, 51, 52.</P>
<P>Moreover they were commanded of God to de&s;troy all &s;uch among them&s;elves as went after fal&s;e wor|&s;hip; and not to pity or conceal any, though it were their &s;ons and daughters, or wife of their bo&s;om, if they enticed them to go and &s;erve other God's; but they were commanded to witne&s;s again&s;t them; and their hands were to be fir&s;t upon them, to put them to death, and afterwards the hands of all the people: &s;ee Deut. xiii. 6 to 12 ver. and chap. xvii. 2 to 8 v.</P>
<P>Now under the law, God's people were to de&s;troy fal&s;e wor&s;hip by the carnal &s;word; but under the go&s;pel by the word of their te&s;timony, as appears Rev. xii. 11. <HI>And they overcame by the blood, of the lamb and by the word of their te&s;timony, and they loved

not their lives unto the death:</HI> Al&s;o Chri&s;t &s;aith, Mat. x. 27, 28. <HI>What I tell you in darkne&s;s, that &s;peak in the light, and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the hou&s;e tops, and fear not them that kill the body, &amp;c.</HI> Thus it appears by the&s;e &s;criptures that Chri&s;t requires his witne&s;&s;es to be very zealous in te&s;tifying again&s;t fal&s;e wor&s;hip: And it is this Godly te&s;timony that our neighbours are offended at, it is the divi&s;ion Chri&s;t came to make, for he came not to &s;end peace on earth, but a &s;word; he came to kindle a fire, and make a divi&s;ion: See Mat. x. 34, &amp;c. Al&s;o Luke xii. 49 and 51. Now the e&s;tabli&s;hed mini&s;ters of this land, learn their trades and hire them&s;elves out as other trade&s;men do: They are hired by the year to preach, as idolators were of old; Judg. xvii. 10. And our &s;aviour &s;aith, the hireling careth not for the &s;heep: John x, 13. Al&s;o Chri&s;t calls &s;uch fal&s;e pro|phets and ravening wolves: Mat. vii. 15. More|over Chri&s;t &s;aith they devour widows hou&s;es, and for a pretence make long prayers: Mat. xxiii. 14. Al&s;o the prophet cries out again&s;t &s;uch hirelings: I&s;aiah lvi, 10. <HI>His watchmen are blind, they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs.</HI> Ver&s;e 11. <HI>Yea they are greedy dogs, which can never have enough, and they are &s;hepherds that cannot under&s;tand, they all look to their own way, every one for his gain from his quarter.</HI> And do not the hireling watchman of this land, look to their own way, even to their own worldly intere&s;t, every one for his gain from his quarter or pari&s;h, as much as tho&s;e watchmen did in the prophet I&s;aiah's time: Ezek. xxxiv. 2, 3, <HI>Woe be the &s;hepherds of I&s;rael that do feed them&s;elves, &s;hould not the &s;hepherds feed the flock, ye eat the fat and ye cloath you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed, but ye feed not the flock.</HI> Al&s;o we read 2 Tim. iv. 3. and 2 Peter ii. 3. that the time would come when they would heap to

them&s;elves teachers having itching ears, and that they would make merchandize of the people: And we &s;ee the&s;e &s;criptures fulfilled in this our day; for there is &s;uch heaps of vain youths brought up at colleges, that they &s;worm out like locu&s;ts out of the &s;moak of the bottomle&s;s pit: Rev. ix. 2, 3. Enough to &s;upply every town and village in the country, and to &s;pare; for they are as thick as Baal's prie&s;ts were in the days of Elijah.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the&s;e hireling prie&s;ts teach people to ob&s;erve the fir&s;t day of the week as a &s;abbath, but the &s;crip|ture teacheth no &s;uch thing, for there is not one word in all the &s;cripture that &s;ays any thing about its being a &s;abbath: And the &s;cripture &s;ays, <HI>where no law is, there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> Rom. iv. 15. <HI>And &s;in is not imputed when there is no law,</HI> Rom. v. 13. <HI>To the law and the te&s;timony, if they &s;peak not according to this word, it is becau&s;e there is no light in them.</HI> I&s;aiah viii. 20.</P>
<P>Moreover the&s;e hireling prie&s;ts &s;prinkle people, in&s;tead of bapti&s;ing them, and &s;prinkle little infants al&s;o, contrary to the practice and example given to us both by Chri&s;t and his holy apo&s;tles, as appears by the&s;e following &s;criptures; Acts ii. 38. <HI>Then Peter &s;aid unto them, repent and be bapti&s;ed every one of you in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and ye &s;hall receive the gift of the holy gho&s;t.</HI> But infants have nothing to repent of, for they are not capable of committing &s;in, for they have no knowledge between good and evil: See Deut. i. 39. Al&s;o we are to be buried with Chri&s;t by bapti&s;m: Rom. vi. 4. <HI>Buried with him by bapti&s;m into death, that like as Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed up from the dead by the glory of the father, even &s;o we al&s;o &s;hould walk in newne&s;s of life.</HI> And Chri&s;t's me&s;&s;engers always bapti&s;ed the believing and repent|ing &s;inner, by burying him in the water, in the like|ne&s;s

of Chri&s;t's death, and rai&s;ing him up out of the water in the likene&s;s of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection; as appears throughout the new te&s;tament: Acts viii. 37, 38, 39 <HI>And Philip &s;aid, if thou believe&s;t with all thine heart, thou maye&s;t; and they went down both into the water, both Phi|lip and the Eunuch, and he bapti&s;ed him, and when they were come up out of the water, &amp;c.</HI> Mat. iii. 5, 6. <HI>Then went out to him Jeru&s;alem and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jordan, confe&s;&s;ing their &s;ins:</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears by the&s;e &s;criptures, that we mu&s;t repent and believe with all our heart, and confe&s;s our &s;ins before we can be fit &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m: Al&s;o the Greek word baptize, is wa&s;h or dip in water: <HI>And Je&s;us when he was bapti&s;ed, went up &s;traight way out of the water,</HI> Mat. iii. 16. <HI>And John al&s;o was bapti&s;ing in Enon, becau&s;e there was much water there,</HI> John iii. 23. Which &s;cripture fully confutes and condemns this Popi&s;h practice of &s;prinkling in&s;tead of bapti&s;ing.</P>
<P>Al&s;o Chri&s;t commanded his di&s;ciples not to be like the hypocrites that prayed in &s;ynagogues and public places, Matt. vi. 5. But the hireling prie&s;ts of this land go contrary to this plain command of Chri&s;t, and contrary to his practice: For the &s;cripture doth not &s;hew that ever Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles made a pray|er in a public a&s;&s;embly when they were met together for preaching: Al&s;o the dre&s;s of their churches, which are dre&s;&s;ed in gold and co&s;tly array, contrary to 1 Tim. ii. 9. and 1 Pet. iii. 3, re&s;embles the dre&s;s of my&s;tery Babylon the great, the mother of harlots, that was drunk with the blood of the &s;aints and martyrs of Je&s;us, and arrayed in purple, and deck|ed with gold, &amp;c. harlot-like, Rev. xvii. 4. &amp;c.

contrary to the &s;criptures, and that all the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip of this land is upheld and carried on in pride and oppre&s;&s;ion, by the in&s;tigation of <HI>that old &s;erpent called the devil and &s;atan, which deceiveth the whole world,</HI> Rev. xii. 9.

<HEAD>Concerning Women's Prophe&s;ying or Teaching in the Church.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN God delivered I&s;rael his cho&s;en people from the Egyptian bondage, he did not &s;end men teachers only, to in&s;truct his church, but he &s;ent a woman teacher al&s;o, to teach and in&s;truct his people. See Mic. vi. 4. <HI>I &s;ent before thee Mo&s;es, Aaron, and Miriam.</HI> Here we may &s;ee that God &s;ent a wo|man teacher to in&s;truct his church and people, and to

go before them, as he &s;ent Mo&s;es and Aaron. Joel ii. 28. <HI>Your &s;ons and your daughters &s;hall prophe&s;y.</HI> Acts xxi. 9. Philip had four daughters that pro|phe&s;ied, the&s;e were teachers in the church: for the apo&s;tle &s;ays, 1 Cor. xiv. 3. <HI>He that prophe&s;ieth &s;peaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort.</HI> So that the&s;e women were &s;ent of God, to teach and exhort the church: Al&s;o in the fir&s;t ver&s;e of this chapter, the church is exhorted <HI>to follow after charity, and de&s;ire &s;piritual gifts; but rather that they may prophe&s;y.</HI> Ver&s;e 4th, <HI>He that prophe&s;ieth edifieth the church;</HI> that is by teaching and exhortation. Ver&s;e 5th, <HI>Greater is he that prophe&s;ieth.</HI> Here we may &s;ee that the apo&s;tle prefers the gift of prophe&s;y or teaching as one of the mo&s;t excellent gifts in the church. This excellent gift God be&s;tows upon women. Joel ii. 28. <HI>Your daughters &s;hall prophe&s;y</HI> or teach. Moreover in the 4th chapter of Judges we have an account of Deborah, a prophete&s;s, a judge that God rai&s;ed up and &s;ent to teach and in&s;truct I&s;rael his cho&s;en people, and to go before them. Al&s;o we read 2 Kings xxii. 13, &amp;c. of king Jo&s;iah's &s;ending his princes to a wo|man teacher, for her to enquire of the Lord for him and for the inhabitants of Judah and Jeru&s;alem: <HI>And &s;he &s;aid unto the princes, thus &s;aith the Lord God of I&s;rael, tell the man that &s;ent you unto me, &amp;c.</HI> Al&s;o in Luke ii. 36, we have an account of one Anna, a woman teacher, that departed not from the temple, and &s;poke of Chri&s;t to all them that looked for re|demption in Jeru&s;alem. Moreover we have an ac|count in Rom. xvi. 3, &amp;c. of Pri&s;cilla, Paul's helper in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who for his &s;ake, laid down her own neck. This woman was one that travelled with Paul, as appears Acts xviii. 18.

took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of the Lord more perfectly.</HI> Acts xviii. 26.</P>
<P>Thus it appears by the holy &s;criptures, that God &s;ends women to teach and in&s;truct his church, and to expound the way of the Lord, and that he endues them with the gift of prophe&s;y: And he that pro|phe&s;ieth &s;aith the apo&s;tle, &s;peaks to men to edification and exhortation and comfort.</P>
<P>But it may be objected that the apo&s;tle &s;aid to the church of Corinth, <HI>Let your women keep &s;ilence in the churches, for it is not permitted unto them to &s;peak.</HI></P>
<P>To which we an&s;wer, That this church of Corinth had gotten into great confu&s;ion and di&s;order, as appears 1 Cor. xiv. 26.

<P>Neither can we rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that the apo&s;tle meant to &s;ilence &s;uch women as Miriam, that God rai&s;ed up for a teacher, and &s;ent before I&s;rael with Mo&s;es and Aaron, to teach and in&s;truct his church: Neither could he intend &s;uch women as Deborah the prophete&s;s, a judge that God rai&s;ed up and &s;et over I&s;rael, to teach and in&s;truct his church, and to go before them: For &s;uch godly judges are to &s;peak and teach in the church and not to be &s;ilent, &s;ee Judg. v. 10. <HI>Speak ye that ride on white a&s;&s;es, ye that &s;et in judgment.</HI></P>
