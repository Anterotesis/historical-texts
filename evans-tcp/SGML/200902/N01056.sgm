<Q><BIBL><HI>Joh VI. 37.</HI></BIBL>
<P>All that the Father giveth me, &s;hall come to me.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE ESSAY which I am going upon, is, To Re&s;cue &s;ome Glorious <HI>Truths</HI> of GOD and of GRACE, from the <HI>Abu&s;e,</HI> which I See they commonly meet withal. <HI>Truths,</HI> I am &s;ure, they are, which the Service of our Holy Religion mightily requires us to Explain and Propound in &s;uch a manner, as that <HI>they</HI> may be Serviceable. <HI>O Eternal Spirit of Truth, Who Leade&s;t thy Servants into all Truth, A&s;&s;i&s;t and Pro&s;per my Undertaking&punc;</HI></P>
<P>The Illu&s;trious Doctrine of <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> Some that Profe&s;s the Belief of it, very Sinfully <HI>Pervert</HI> it, as if it were a Doctrine Calculated either for the <HI>Security,</HI> or the <HI>Di&s;couragement,</HI> of them who &s;hould be brought unto <HI>Repentance;</HI> to make Sinful Men, either <HI>Pre&s;umptuous</HI> or <HI>De&s;perate,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="001256_0003_0FB18A3C357A1BF8">
Whereupon the Doctrine is decried by the Sons of Pride and Profanene&s;s, as if it were an <HI>U&s;ele&s;s,</HI> yea, and an <HI>Hurtful</HI> Doctrine, and as if it were be&s;t of all never at all to meddle with it.</P>
<P>A Glorious Doctrine of Chri&s;tianity, has been <HI>Crucifyed</HI> between <HI>Two Thieves:</HI> It mu&s;t be <HI>Deliver|ed from the Sword;</HI> the <HI>dear</HI> Truth mu&s;t be <HI>Deli|vered from the Power of the Dog:</HI> A <HI>Crown of Glory</HI> mu&s;t be &s;et upon the Head thereof.</P>
<P>Indeed the Doctrine of <HI>Prede&s;tination</HI> hath its My&s;teries, its Ab&s;tru&s;e Difficulties, and Soaring Sublimities. But, for men to pretend therefore, that it &s;hould be Silenced and Smothered &amp; Shut out of Sermons, is for them to be, as the Profe&s;|&s;ors of <HI>Leyden</HI> ju&s;tly Expre&s;&s;ed it, <HI>Praepo&s;tere Cauti,</HI> more <HI>Nice</HI> than <HI>Wi&s;e,</HI> more Cautious than they need to be; and there is u&s;ually, <HI>A Snake in the Gra&s;s,</HI> when &s;uch a <HI>Doctrine of Godline&s;s</HI> is much <HI>hi&s;&s;ed</HI> at. We find, the Doctrine of <HI>Prede&s;ti|nation</HI> Propo&s;ed by our LORD, and His A|po&s;tles, with a very frequent Inculcation; We find, that it hath a wondrous Tendency to the <HI>Edification</HI> of the Faithful in their <HI>mo&s;t Holy Faith,</HI> and the Ignorance of it mutilates the <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> of God, and cheri&s;hes the <HI>Vice</HI> of man, in very con|&s;iderable In&s;tances. Briefly, Tis no little part of the <HI>Go&s;pel;</HI> and we do not fully Preach the <HI>Go&s;|pel, Declaring the whole Coun&s;el of God,</HI> if there be nothing of <HI>this</HI> Declared.</P>
<P>This is a thing to be &s;et before you, in the mo&s;t advantageous Terms that I can meet with|al.

And where can any be met withal compa|rable to tho&s;e in the <HI>Seventeenth</HI> among tho&s;e Fa|mous <HI>Articles</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> which are Sub&s;cribed by all the Allowed Clergy of the Nation!</P>
<P>PREDESTINATION <HI>to Life, is the E|verla&s;ting Purpo&s;e of God, whereby before the Foundations of the World were laid, He hath con&s;tantly Decreed by His Coun&s;el, &s;ecret to us, to deliver from Cur&s;e and Damnation, tho&s;e whom He hath Cho&s;en in Chri&s;t Ie&s;us out of Mankind, and to bring them by Chri&s;t to Everla&s;ting Salvation, as Ve&s;&s;els made to Honour.</HI></P>
<P>It Proceeds.</P>
<P><HI>As the Godly Confideration of</HI> PRE|DESTINATION <HI>and our Election in Chri&s;t, is full of Sweet, Plea&s;ant and Vn&s;peakable Comfort to Godly Per|&s;ons, and &s;uch as feel in them&s;eves the workings of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, &mdash; as well becau&s;e it doth E&s;tabli&s;h and Confirm their Faith of Eternal Sal|vation, to be Enjoy'd thro' Chri&s;t, as becau&s;e it doth frequently kindle their Love towards God; &s;o for curious and carnal Per&s;ons lacking the Spi|rit of Chri&s;t, to have continually before their Eyes, the Sentence of Gods Pre|de&s;tination, is a mo&s;t dangerous Down fall.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001256_0005_0FB18A3FF92F6780">The Doctrine &s;o Plainly <HI>A&s;&s;erted</HI> by the <HI>Church of England,</HI> is every Day &s;o Unaccountably De|cried, and Reproached, by many from whom One could not with any <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> have Expected it, many, who boa&s;t them&s;elves <HI>the Sons of the Church;</HI> that it is high Time for us, to do what we may, to <HI>Magnify it and make it Honourable.</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord-Redeemer is now Preaching of the Doctrine. He had a very &s;orrowful Sight before Him; the <HI>Unbelief,</HI> the General and the Horri|ble Unbelief of the People to whom He had been Exhibited. That our Lord might Comfort Him|&s;elf under the <HI>Un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s</HI> of His Mini&s;try, and that He might pre&s;erve others from the <HI>Tempta|tion</HI> and <HI>Stumbling-block</HI> therein Laid before them, He Propounds, the <HI>Decree</HI> of God in His Eternal <HI>Prede&s;tination.</HI></P>
<P>What el&s;e can we have, in any mea&s;ure to allay the Di&s;compo&s;ure of our Minds, when we &s;ee the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> hitherto &s;o little Crown'd with <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> in the World! <HI>All that the Father gives to me,</HI> &s;aith our Lord, <HI>&s;hall come to me.</HI></P>
<P>Tis plainly A&s;&s;erted, That <HI>every one, who is given</HI> to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t by God the Father, &s;hall at one Time or other by Faith <HI>come unto Him.</HI> Tis plainly A&s;&s;erted, That the&s;e Per&s;ons are <HI>given</HI> to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, before they do by Faith <HI>come unto Him.</HI> Hence it follows, That the <HI>giv|ing</HI> of any to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t by God the Father, is not His <HI>Bringing</HI> them to <HI>Believe</HI> on Him. If it be <HI>Before</HI> their Believing, we &s;hall

&s;oon find it to be, as other of the Divine Oracles have told us, <HI>From all Eternity.</HI></P>
<P>This then is the DOCTRINE to be in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P><HI>There are Some, whom God the Fa|ther, has from all Eternity given unto our Lord-Redeemer, to be brought by Him unto Eternal Ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s; and all that are &s;o Given unto our Lord, &s;hall in Time come unto Him.</HI></P>
<P>Do not imagine, That I am going to Enter|tain you with Unprofitable Speculations. No; Your Entertainment &s;hall be a <HI>Great My&s;tery of Godline&s;s;</HI> I &s;hall u&s;e my be&s;t contrivance, that every Stroke of it may be mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly Sub|&s;ervient unto the De&s;igns of <HI>Godline&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> Shall we prove, <HI>That there are Some, whom God has from all Eternity Cho&s;en, to be brought unto Eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s?</HI> They who Di&s;pute this, <HI>do Err, not knowing the Scripture, nor the Nature of God.</HI> Indeed, the <HI>Chri&s;tian Fathers</HI> did not &s;o often and &s;o clearly Expre&s;s them&s;elves about our <HI>Eternal Election,</HI> before the <HI>Pelagian Here&s;y</HI> made much Di&s;turbance, as <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> and Others did afterwards. But the Word of God is very Po&s;itive; [Rom. 8.29.] That there are Some, <HI>Whom God did Fore-know, and whom He did Fore-know, He al&s;o did Pre|de&s;tinate,
<PB N="6" REF="001256_0007_0FB18A43E43341F8">
to be conformed unto the Image of His Son.</HI> And, [2 The&s;&s;. 2.13.] That there are Some, <HI>Whom God has from the Beginning Cho&s;en to Salvation.</HI> And, [1 Pet. 1.2.] That there are Some, <HI>Elect according to the Fore knowledge of God the Father.</HI> Do we not read, [Rev. 13.8.] Of, <HI>Names Written in the Book of Life of the Slain Lamb, from the Foun|dation of the World?</HI> In the Word of God, we find a Remarkable Di&s;tinction, [1 The&s;&s;. 5.9.] Between Some <HI>Appointed unto Wrath,</HI> and Others <HI>Appointed to obtain Salvation by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> The Import of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, will &s;oon be per|ceived, if you will but lay together a few Incon|te&s;table Conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>There is an <HI>Eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s;</HI> or, a <HI>Re&s;t which remains for the People of God,</HI> yea, a State wherein God &s;hall become <HI>All in All</HI> unto His People. No body doubts of this.</P>
<P>There are Some who do arrive to <HI>Eternal Ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s;</HI> And they are but <HI>Some; Some</HI> there are who <HI>fall &s;hort of Entering into Re&s;t.</HI> No body doubts of this.</P>
<P>The <HI>Eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> is the gift of <HI>God;</HI> None ever come to <HI>Eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s,</HI> but &s;uch as are by the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD Him&s;elf brought unto it. No body doubts of this.</P>
<P>God from all Eternity does infallibly <HI>Fore know</HI> whom He will bring unto <HI>Eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</HI> It can't be &s;aid of any Per&s;on in the <HI>Eternal Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s,</HI> That God once did not infallibly <HI>Fore know</HI> whether this Per&s;on &s;hould ever come unto it.
<PB N="7" REF="001256_0008_0FB18A4569ECECE8">
Can any body doubt of this?</P>
<P>Once more; The <HI>Eternal Certainty</HI> of the <HI>E|ternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> to be granted unto the&s;e and tho&s;e Per&s;ons, cannot ari&s;e from the Per&s;ons them&s;elves, who are not yet in Being; It can ari&s;e from nothing but <HI>God</HI> Him&s;elf Determining of it; from nothing but the <HI>Determination</HI> of God.</P>
<P>The Sum of the Argument is this.</P>
<P>If it be Certainly and Exactly <HI>Fore known</HI> by God from all Eternity, Who &s;hall be brought by Him to <HI>Eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s,</HI> then it is <HI>Decreed</HI> by God; there is in the <HI>Will</HI> of God a <HI>Determination</HI> of it. But there is a mo&s;t <HI>Certain Fore knowledge</HI> of God, <HI>(unto whom all His Works are known from the Beginning,)</HI> even from all Eternity, A&s;&s;uring Him, who &s;hall be brought by Him to Eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. God forbid, We &s;hould &s;o derogate from His Infinite Maje&s;ty, as if He did not from all <HI>Eternity</HI> mo&s;t certainly <HI>Know</HI> what &s;hall come to pa&s;s in <HI>Time: Lord, Thy Under&s;tanding is Infinite!</HI> Therefore, it remains, That there are Some Cho|&s;en by a <HI>Decree</HI> of God, from all Eternity, to E|ternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon this Argument, our <HI>Twi&s;s</HI> openly chal|lenged the whole Nation of <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> and <HI>Armini|ans;</HI> he truly &s;ayes of it, It is, <HI>Nullo humano acu|mine Solubile;</HI> It is unan&s;werable.</P>
<P>But now, My Hearers, Let us make a Pau&s;e. This admirable Truth &s;hall not go out of our Hands, until we feel it make a mo&s;t Heart-melting Impre&s;&s;ion on our Hearts.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="001256_0009_0FB18A46E1FB95C0">&sect;. We will Enquire, fir&s;t; <HI>Whether they whom God has from all Eternity Cho&s;en to Eternal Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s, may come to Know that they are &s;o Cho&s;en to it, while they are yet but in the way loading to it?</HI></P>
<P>Yes; They may. They may <HI>Know</HI> it, by their being <HI>in the way leading to it;</HI> For it is, <HI>The Way Everla&s;ting.</HI> There are &s;ome, who&s;e Priviledge is that, 1 The&s;&s;. 1.4. <HI>Knowing your Election of God.</HI></P>
<P>But how &s;hall we attain to this Priviledge?</P>
<P>O Child of God; <HI>Say not in thy Heart,</HI> who &s;hall a&s;cend into Heaven, to &s;ee whether I have my <HI>Name Written in Heaven?</HI> Who &s;hall bring down to me the <HI>Book of Life,</HI> to &s;ee whe|ther I am Enroll'd in that Book or no? The Proof of all this matter is <HI>Nigh</HI> unto thee; Tis in thy own Heart, in thy own Life; There it may be met withal. Oh! Give a Great Atten|tion!</P>
<P>You have <HI>not forgotten the Exhortation, that &s;o &s;peaks unto you;</HI> 2 Pet. 1.10. <HI>Give Diligence to make your Calling and Election Sure.</HI> If you are <HI>Sure,</HI> That you are <HI>Effectually Called,</HI> you may be <HI>Sure,</HI> That you are <HI>Eternally Cho&s;en</HI> of God. The matter may <HI>at this Moment</HI> be brought unto a wondrous I&s;&s;ue. The <HI>Call</HI> of our Great Saviour is at this Moment made from Heaven unto every one of us; <HI>Look unto me, and be Saved; come unto me, that I may make you Wi&s;e, and Righteous and Holy and Happy.</HI> May the Spirit of Grace now fall upon us; may our Conquered Souls comply with the Call, and Reply to it; <HI>Lord, I Look!
<PB N="9" REF="001256_0010_0FB18A48AF80F320">
Lord, I come! Lord; Thou ha&s;t made me willing to take thee for my Saviour, my Leader, my Ruler for ever more!</HI> From this Moment, O Regenerated Souls, you may take for granted your <HI>Election</HI> of God; you may take it for granted; <HI>My God will now give me to &s;ee the Good of His Cho&s;en, and rejoyce with the gladne&s;s of His Nation, and Glory with His Inheritance.</HI></P>
<P>We read, Act. 13.48. <HI>As many as were ordained unto Eternal Life believed.</HI> Examine then; <Q>Do I <HI>Believe</HI> on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t? Is my whole <HI>Reliance</HI> upon Him, as my <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and my <HI>Ad|vocate,</HI> for my Peace with God? Am I heartily Re&s;ign'd unto Him, for Him to <HI>Guide me by Coun&s;il, and bring me to Glory?</HI></Q> If it be &s;o, then be of Good Comfort; Thou art mo&s;t certainly <HI>Ordained unto Eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P>We read, Eph. 1.4. <HI>He has Cho&s;en us, that we &s;hould be Holy.</HI> Examine then; <Q>Am I <HI>Holy?</HI> Do I follow nothing &s;o much as <HI>Holine&s;s?</HI> Do I La|ment nothing &s;o much as my want of <HI>Holine&s;s?</HI> Do I Sincerely <HI>Dedicate</HI> my &s;elf unto God? Would I fain be entirely Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by <HI>God,</HI> and have my All employ'd in Serving of Him?</Q> If it be &s;o, then be of Good Comfort; God who <HI>knows who are His,</HI> has <HI>Cho&s;en</HI> thee for one of His.</P>
<P>Go on, and bring the Matter to this <HI>Touch|&s;tone.</HI> We read; 1 Joh. 4.19. <HI>We Love Him, be|cau&s;e He fir&s;t Loved us.</HI> Even &s;o; <HI>We chu&s;e God, becau&s;e He fir&s;t cho&s;e us.</HI> Bring it under an impar|tial Examination. Do you make <HI>Choice</HI> of GOD?

<P><PB N="15" REF="001256_0016_0FB18A5425DA1810">Let us take in the Evangelical <HI>Idea</HI> of the Matter.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t; In the Eternal <HI>Election</HI> of God, it is De|creed, That Such and Such, <HI>[The Per&s;ons are De|termined, and the Number of tho&s;e Per&s;ons is with God!]</HI> They are to be <HI>Heirs of God,</HI> and <HI>Joint-Heirs</HI> with His <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> in the Eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.

Hence it is, that the Tran&s;action between God the Father, and out Lord-Redeemer, in the <HI>Decree</HI> for the <HI>Re|demption</HI> of Man, is mo&s;t fitly repre&s;ented in the Form of a <HI>Covenant;</HI> which we call, <HI>The Co|venant of Redemption.</HI> With an Eye to this wonderful Tran&s;action, we find that pa&s;&s;age in our <HI>Lively Oracles;</HI> P&s;al. 89.3. <HI>I have made a Covenant with my cho&s;en, I have Sworn unto Da|vid my Servant.</HI></P>

will not come unto me, that ye might have life.</HI> I Pray, What Excu&s;e is it, for any other Crime, to Say, <HI>My Will &s;tands that way!</HI> The mo&s;t Vicious People in the World, have an Excu&s;e for their not Re|forming of their Vices, if the want of a <HI>Will</HI> to do it, may go for one. As little will this Excu&s;e our <HI>Neglect of the Great Salvation;</HI> to plead, <HI>I have no Will to Look after it!</HI> When the Exhortations are made unto the <HI>Sinner,</HI> to <HI>Come</HI> unto a <HI>Saviour,</HI> and receive <HI>the Un&s;earcheable Riches of Chri&s;t,</HI> Why does he not <HI>Come?</HI> What is the Rea&s;on?

To Say, <HI>I am Wicked, becau&s;e I am not willing to be otherwi&s;e!</HI></P>
<P>I may Venture to A&s;&s;ert This; That never any man in the World, could Say, <HI>I am willing to come unto my Saviour, but He does not make me Able to come.</HI> The Sin|ner does Really <HI>Begin</HI> to Believe on a Glorious CHRIST, if once he do Sincerely <HI>De&s;ire</HI> to do it, or De&s;ire that God would Enable Him to do it. <HI>Faith</HI> is actually <HI>Be|gun,</HI> in the Soul, that is made Sincerely <HI>Willing</HI> to Be|lieve. One Sincerely <HI>Willing</HI> to <HI>come</HI> unto the <HI>Saviour,</HI> had rather be gratified in this Point, than in any World|ly Intere&s;t; He Prefers a Glorious CHRIST, above all the Things of this World; He Neglects no <HI>Means,</HI> he Omits no <HI>Cryes,</HI> that he may obtain the <HI>Grace</HI> to <HI>Lay Hold</HI> on Him, &amp; on <HI>Eternal Life</HI> in Him. Unbeliever, Thou art <HI>not, Willing</HI> to be any other than what thou <HI>art.</HI> And, This, This, will be thy <HI>Condemnation.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. This <HI>Impotency</HI> mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;d and Be|wayled in our <HI>Coming</HI> to our Saviour; &amp; our Sen&s;ible
<PB N="67" REF="001256_0068_0FB18AB55CEEC8B8">
Confe&s;&s;ion of it, is a <HI>notable &s;tep</HI> of our <HI>Coming</HI> unto Him. It is not likely, that the Spirit of Grace will <HI>Enable</HI> us to <HI>Come</HI> unto our Saviour, till we feel and own that we are <HI>&V;nable</HI> to <HI>Come.</HI> When we become <HI>Sen&s;ible</HI> that we are <HI>&V;nable,</HI> and become <HI>De&s;irous</HI> to be <HI>Enabled,</HI> then we are indeed <HI>Beginning</HI> to come. When the <HI>Grace</HI> to Be|lieve on a Glorious CHRIST, is to be wrought in a Soul, the <HI>God of all Grace,</HI> will have the Glory of work|ing it. See, O Sinner, That thou art <HI>Justly Damned,</HI> if thou do&s;t not come to thy Saviour. <HI>See</HI> this; and <HI>Say</HI> it before the Lord. But at the &s;ame time al&s;o humbly &s;ay; <HI>Lord, I &s;hall not come to my Saviour, if thy Sovereign Grace do not help me to come!</HI> 'Tis true, Such a Corrup|tion there is upon the <HI>Will</HI> of <HI>&V;nregenerate Man,</HI> that he <HI>will not come</HI> unto a Glorious CHRIST, but indeed have a greater Enmity to this, than to any one thing in all Religion; till there be an Efficacious and Superna|tural Operation of God upon the <HI>Will,</HI> not only to lay <HI>Moral Sua&s;ions</HI> before it, but al&s;o to infu&s;e a <HI>New Frame</HI> into it, and Effectually Incline it unto the <HI>Faith</HI> where|to it is an Enemy. So far is the Sinner, from an <HI>Abi|lity</HI> to change his own <HI>Will,</HI> and bring it unto the <HI>Faith</HI> of a Glorious CHRIST, that whatever he does from his own meer <HI>Natural Ability,</HI> cannot oblige the God of Heaven, to make a Saving Change upon it. Let us keep to that famous <HI>Tenth Article</HI> of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> <Q>The Condition of man is &s;uch, after the Fall, that he cannot turn, nor prepare him&s;elf by his own Natural Strength, to Faith and Calling upon God. Wherefore we have no power to do Good Works plea&s;ant and acceptable to God, without the Grace of God preventing us, that we may have a Good Will, and working with us, when we have that Good Will.</Q></P>
<P>But then, how is this <HI>Good Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> to be pro&s;ecu|ted? Not now to <HI>Ly down like a Stag in a Net,</HI> with de&s;|pair
<PB N="68" REF="001256_0069_0FB18AB711E8F600">
ever to e&s;cape the <HI>Fury of the Lord.</HI> No; but from thy <HI>Sinful Grave,</HI> O Sinner, &s;end up thy Sighs un|to the Lord. Tho' Lying in the <HI>Belly of Hell,</HI> yet give a <HI>Look</HI> towards the <HI>Holy Temple.</HI> Make that Acknow|ledgment; Joh. 6.44. <HI>No man can come, except the Father Draw him.</HI> But then beg it of the <HI>Father; Oh! Draw me, Draw me to my Saviour!</HI> Acknowledge that; Eph. 2.8. <HI>Faith, is not of your &s;elves, 'tis the Gift of God.</HI> But, then, beg it of God; <HI>Oh! Give me, Give me, a true Faith in my Saviour!</HI> Acknowledge that; Phil 2.13. <HI>It is God, who worketh in you, both to Will and to Do, of His Good plea&s;ure</HI> But then, beg it of God; <HI>Oh! Work in me the Will, and help me to do this thing, to Come unto my Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>After this <HI>praeface</HI> unto it, <HI>Now</HI> come! Now &s;ee whe|ther thou can&s;t not, with a <HI>New Life</HI> infu&s;ed into thee from Heaven, &s;ay, <HI>Lord! I come unto thee!</HI></P>
<P>Another thing, that cau&s;es much <HI>Confu&s;ion,</HI> to them that are invited by a Great SAVIOUR, to <HI>Come</HI> unto Him, is This.</P>
<P><Q>Does it not Look like Double Dealing? What Re|ality can there be, in the Lords bidding all men to come unto Him, when He knows He will not help them all to do it. If the Lord has not Really purpo|&s;ed, that He will Enable any but His Elect Effectu|ally to come unto Him, what Sincerity can there be in His calling them to come?</Q></P>
<P>Sinner, Let none of the&s;e <HI>Cavils</HI> retard thy <HI>Coming</HI> to thy <HI>Saviour.</HI> It's a meer piece of <HI>Confu&s;ion</HI> to in&s;i&s;t upon them. 'Tis Enough, That He calls <HI>Thee</HI> to <HI>Come,</HI> and He will <HI>not co&s;t thee out,</HI> if thou <HI>Come.</HI> Do but <HI>Come,</HI> and thou &s;halt find He has been mo&s;t <HI>Sin|cere</HI> in His <HI>Call</HI> unto thee.</P>
<P>'Tis true; The Lord knows, that <HI>Reprobates</HI> will not <HI>Come</HI> unto Him; And, He knows, that He will

<P><HI>Reprobation</HI> is not the Immediate <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> why the <HI>Re|probate</HI> will not <HI>Come</HI> unto the <HI>Saviour.</HI> No; Their own Sinful, Corrupt, Wicked <HI>Nature</HI> is the <HI>Cau&s;e.</HI> If God &s;hould Lay <HI>Chains</HI> upon a <HI>Sinner,</HI> again&s;t his <HI>Will,</HI> and then Bid him to <HI>Come</HI> unto a <HI>Saviour,</HI> this indeed would look like a <HI>Mockery.</HI> But the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> why a <HI>Sin|ner</HI> does not <HI>Come</HI> unto a <HI>Saviour,</HI> is not becau&s;e God will not <HI>Enable</HI> him; 'Tis becau&s;e he has <HI>Di&s;abled</HI> him&s;elf; he has ca&s;t him&s;elf into the <HI>Snares</HI> of Death, and keeps the <HI>Chains</HI> of Hell upon his own Soul.</P>

<P>Wherefore, <HI>O Sinner, Talk no more exceeding vainly, nor let any more of this Cavilling proceed out of thy mouth.</HI> Try, Strive, Beg, that thou may&s;t <HI>Come</HI> unto thy <HI>Saviour; Come</HI> to Him, as well as thou <HI>canst.</HI> It may be, that <HI>He</HI> will help thee to <HI>Come.</HI> Then thy <HI>Labour &s;hall not be in vain in the Lord.</HI></P>
