<HEAD><HI>An E&s;&s;ay to do GOOD.</HI> By a di&s;&s;wa&s;ive from Tavern-haunting, and Exce&s;&s;ive Drinking.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">By <HI>Benjamin Wad&s;worth,</HI> Pa&s;tor of a Church of Chri&s;t in <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> together with a <HI>Lecture SERMON,</HI> by the &s;ame Author.</HEAD>
<P>TIS &s;aid of our glorious Redeemer, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that he went about <HI>doing good.</HI> Act 10.38. All his Di&s;ci|ples, <HI>&s;hould walk as he al&s;o walked,</HI> 1 Joh. 2.6.

And it mu&s;t needs be reckon'd a good work, not only to morti|fie our own lu&s;ts and corruptions (which we &s;hould chiefly and con&s;tantly endeavour to do) but al&s;o to prevent and &s;uppre&s;s Sin in others, as much as po&s;&s;ibly we can. Tis <HI>Brotherly, Neighbour|ly</HI> kindne&s;s, to <HI>reprove</HI> others for and caution them again&s;t Sin, <HI>Lev.</HI> 19 17. We &s;hould e&s;pecially wit|ne&s;s again&s;t, and endeavour to put a &s;top to, <HI>growing threatning Evils;</HI> and among <HI>Sundry &s;uch</HI> evils in our Land; I reckon <HI>Exce&s;&s;ive Drinking</HI> to be one. I therefore thought it proper and &s;ea&s;onable, to bear &s;ome Te&s;timony again&s;t this growing wick|edne&s;s;

by offering &s;ome few con&s;iderations, to tho&s;e who <HI>needle&s;ly frequent Taverns;</HI> and al&s;o to <HI>Tavern-keepers,</HI> or to tho&s;e who <HI>Retail Drink,</HI> whe|ther they are <HI>Innholders</HI> or not Yet le&s;t I &s;hould be mi&s;-interpreted, or be thought to run into ex|treams; I'll readily grant,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the keeping of Taverns, or Hou&s;es of Enter|tainment, is not only lawful, but al&s;o very u&s;eful and convenient.</HI> The proper end and u&s;e of <HI>Taverns, Inns Ale-hou&s;es, Victualing-hou&s;es,</HI> or <HI>Hou&s;es of Entertain|ment,</HI> in general, is, the <HI>accommodating of Strangers and Travellers.</HI> If Per&s;ons had no occa&s;ion to be far from home, there would be no occa&s;ion or|dinarily for <HI>Taverns.</HI> But the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of many (yea of mo&s;t at one time or other) calls them to be abroad, <HI>Journeying</HI> or <HI>Trading</HI> far from home. Now when Per&s;ons are thus di&s;tant from home, Hou&s;es of Entertainment are needful, to accommodate them with <HI>Victuals, Drink, Lodgings, &amp;c.</HI> I grant,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That Town-dwellers who are nigh home, may &s;ome|times, have proper occa&s;ions to go into Taverns, and &s;tay a while there.</HI> No doubt but &s;uch Town-dwellers (e&s;pecially tho&s;e who have mo&s;t <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> with <HI>Strangers and Travellers</HI>) may &s;ometimes have real bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Taverns,</HI> and &s;o have proper occa|&s;ion to go thither for the doing of it. And no doubt but when their bu&s;ine&s;s calls them there, they may allowably buy and u&s;e, what drink is proper and needful for their <HI>Refre&s;hment.</HI></P>
<P>I grant,</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>That the u&s;e of Strong Drink, yea of Strong Spirits, is not only Lawful, but in &s;ome ca&s;es convenient.</HI> I verily believe, that various &s;orts of Strong Drink are greatly abus'd in this Land, and <HI>Rum</HI> e&s;peci|ally. But tho' many abu&s;e the&s;e things, it does
<PB N="3" REF="001491_0003_0FB34FE4E73D6518">
not thence follow that 'tis unlawful to u&s;e them. I grant that even <HI>Distill'd Spirits</HI> may do good, when taken only in a moderate quantity, and only at &s;uch times or &s;ea&s;ons, when there is <HI>proper oc|ca&s;ion</HI> for them. But tho' I readily grant the&s;e three things but now mention'd, yet I verily be|lieve, that multitudes of Per&s;ons in this Land, are very criminal and blame-worthy; for their <HI>need|le&s;s haunting of Drinking-hou&s;es,</HI> and &s;pending their Time and Money there. Now out of hearty re|gard to the glory of God, the good of the Publick, and the benefit of &s;uch faulty Per&s;ons; I would Intreat, Exhort and Urge, tho&s;e who are thus blame-worthy, to reform &s;uch their ill practices. Don't frequent <HI>Taverns</HI> (or any <HI>Drinking hou&s;es,</HI> be they call'd by what name they will) don't &s;pend your time, nor Money there, unle&s;s there be &s;ome <HI>real occa&s;ion,</HI> &s;ome <HI>real bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> that calls you &s;o to do. The Exhortation is,
<Q>Don't needle&s;sly Spend your Time nor Money, at Drinking-hou&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>To move you to a compliance with this Exhor|tation&punc; con&s;ider, by thus doing,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>You Sinfully Spend your</HI> TIME, <HI>which you mu&s;t give an account to God for.</HI> 'Tis in God you live, move and have your being; he holds your Souls in Life, and pre&s;erves your Spirits; every breath you draw, is a renew'd In&s;tance of Divine Mer|cy. God who thus lengthens out your <HI>Time,</HI> re|quires that the whole of it &s;hould be &s;o Imploy'd, as to bring glory to his Name.

And if your ill cour&s;e in frequenting Taverns, brings you into low, &s;trait, impoveri&s;h'd circum&s;tances; then the&s;e (among other) mi&s;chiefs are like to follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>You will be unable to pay your ju&s;t Debts to tho&s;e you deal with.</HI> Gods command is, Rom. 13 8. <HI>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another.</HI> The Pro|phet &s;aid to the Widow, 2 King 4 7. <HI>Pay thy Debt,</HI> P&s;al. 37.21. <HI>The wicked borroweth and payeth not again.</HI> Men are <HI>wicked,</HI> if they dont do their utmo&s;t to <HI>Pay their ju&s;t Debts;</HI> but your ill cour&s;e renders you unable to pay &s;uch Debts, therefore your wicked cour&s;e puts you on further wickedne&s;s.

It may be a Man has met with <HI>Lo&s;&s;es,</HI> or his <HI>Trade Fails,</HI> he's become low and indigent; the next thing is, he &s;eeks a <HI>Licen&s;e to Sell Drink;</HI> and when he has it, po&s;&s;ibly many of his Neighbours ruin them&s;elves, by being his <HI>Wicked Cu&s;tomers.</HI> I fear <HI>many</HI> are <HI>made</HI> poor, by being <HI>Wicked</HI> Cu&s;tomers to others, that were poor <HI>before them.</HI> If tho&s;e really poor and low, would <HI>Keep good Con&s;ciences;</HI> I think they had better follow the harde&s;t labour their Bodies can bear, and be content to live very meanly; than to get a Licen&s;e to Sell Drink: for their Temptations would be very great. How many have rea&s;on to rue the day, that they got &s;uch Licen&s;es? I doubt Li|cen&s;es are &s;o <HI>Multiplied,</HI> that few who have them can get a gain an&s;werable to their Charge and Trouble, and <HI>Keep good Con&s;ciences too.</HI></P>

have our being in God; he holds our Souls in Life and pre&s;erves our Spirits; he upholds all things by the word of his power. The Divine Power, cau&s;eth the Wind to blow, the Sea to flow and ebb, the cele&s;tial Bodies to keep their Stated regular motions. Tis the Divine Power, that up|holds or pre&s;erves the <HI>Natural Powers,</HI> which are in all living Creatures; and &s;o in men as well as in others. Tis the Divine Power that upholds in men, the animal faculties of <HI>Seeing, Hearing, Smelling,</HI> &amp;c. and that does concur with the&s;e fa|culties in &s;uch Sen&s;ations. So the Divine Power pre&s;erves the <HI>Rational Soul,</HI> all its natural powers and abilities, and concurs with the faculties in all their natural operations. If God &s;hould with-draw his &s;u&s;taining power, the Creature would pre&s;ently &s;ink into its original nothing. Or if God &s;hould pre&s;erve the Creature in being, yet it could not act, exert or exerci&s;e its u&s;ual natu|ral powers, if the Divine Agency or Concour&s;e were with-held. All the actions of the Soul may be call'd <HI>Natural,</HI> as perform'd by the <HI>Rational natural faculties</HI> (whether Supernaturally or Gra|ciou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted or not) tho' at the &s;ame time they may be call'd <HI>Moral</HI> too, as they refer to the <HI>Rule</HI> or <HI>Law</HI> of Actions.

And &s;ince there is &s;uch a Divine Concour&s;e, in all humane actions outward or inward, it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that God knows all the motions and actions even of the Souls of men.

mu&s;t needs know all about it. That God knows the hearts of men, is evident,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Becau&s;e he has given Laws, to regulate and govern even the hearts of men.</HI> The Divine law requires us, to <HI>Love</HI> the Lord our God with all our <HI>Heart, Soul, Mind</HI> and <HI>Strength;</HI> and our Neighbour as our &s;elves, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22 37&mdash;39.

Nay indeed all the Commands of God <HI>reach to the Soul,</HI> to the heart; for we &s;hould obey and &s;erve God with <HI>all our heart.</HI> Now &s;ince God gives laws, to regu|late even the inward &s;ecret actions of the heart, the Soul, it plainly follows, that he knows tho&s;e inward &s;ecret actions; for if he knew them not, his laws would &s;ignify nothing, he could not tell when they were kept or broken, and &s;o could not puni&s;h or reward Men according to their ways.

<P N="3">3. <HI>From plain direct A&s;&s;ertions in Scripture.</HI> God is a boundle&s;s Infinite Being, He's every where Pre&s;ent, and nece&s;&s;arily knows all things. <HI>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the Evil and the good,</HI> Prov 15 3 <HI>There is no Creature that is not manife&s;t in his &s;ight, all things are open and naked, to the eyes of him with whom we have to do,</HI> Heb 4.13.

But be&s;ides all this, God as fully knows the <HI>Hearts</HI> of men, as he does their <HI>Words</HI> or <HI>outward Actions. Solomon</HI> &s;aid to God, 1 King 8.39. <HI>Thou even thou only, knowe&s;t the hearts of all the Children of Men.</HI> There is not &s;o much as any one of the Children of Men, but God knows his heart. He knows all the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of men, for <HI>no thought can be with-holden from him.</HI> He knows <HI>the thoughts afar off,</HI> P&s;al. 139.2. What can be more plain and expre&s;s than what God &s;ays? Ezek. 11.5. <HI>I know the things that come into your Mind, every one of them.</HI> No one &s;ingle thought can pa&s;s thro' our Minds, but God ob&s;erves it. God knows what belief we entertain in our Minds, about him&s;elf, about his glorious perfections, about his holy Truths and Ways; what opinions we have about our &s;elves, about our own &s;tate as to the future World, about our own ways and actions; what opinions we have, about other Per&s;ons, other things, &amp; the actions of others.

of what nature &s;oever they are; whether men know any thing of them or not. He knows all the arguings and rea&s;onings we at any time have, about any affair what&s;oever.

<HEAD>We may now proceed to the USE of the&s;e things, in a few Inferences.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. <HI>We &s;hould never allow our &s;elves in any Sin, under the Notion of it's being</HI> SECRET. Indeed, Sins are frequently and properly di&s;tingui&s;h'd into <HI>Open</HI> and <HI>Secret;</HI> but this di&s;tinction refers only to <HI>Men,</HI> and not at all to <HI>God:</HI> for all things are equally known to him. Therefore Oh Man, never indulge thy &s;elf in any Sin, tho' thou can&s;t keep it &s;ecret a while from Men; &s;uch Secrecy, cannot exempt thee from Puni&s;h|ment at la&s;t. If thou dare&s;t not do &s;uch or &s;uch an ill thing, <HI>before Men,</HI> for fear of blame, &s;hame and puni&s;hment from them; and yet dare&s;t to do the &s;ame ill thing <HI>in Secret,</HI> then thou &s;hew|e&s;t more regard to Men than to God. Tis &s;aid of &s;ome Idolaters, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.25. They wor&s;hipped and &s;erved the <HI>Creature, more than the Creator.</HI> So thou &s;hewe&s;t more regard to Creatures, than to the Creator; if thou can&s;t dare to Sin becau&s;e 'tis <HI>in Secret.</HI> Thou &s;hewe&s;t more regard to Mans pre&s;ence, than to Gods pre&s;ence; to Mans eye than to Gods eye. Can&s;t thou dare to <HI>Steal,</HI> becau&s;e men don't &s;ee thee? But con&s;ider Oh man, the Great GOD, the Holy JEHOVAH &s;tands by and looks on.

But alas, notwith&s;tanding all thy Whiffling &s;huffling tricks, notwith&s;tanding all the baffling plea's thou do&s;t u&s;e with thy Sleepy Con|&s;cience; yet God ob&s;erves very critically, all thy methods of Unrighteous gain; and he &s;tamps a cur&s;e on thee for them. 1 The&s;. 4.6. <HI>That no man go beyond or defraud his brother in any matter</HI> (not in any matter what&s;oever) <HI>becau&s;e the Lord is the avenger of all &s;uch.</HI> Can&s;t thou dare among &s;ome of thine Intimates, to belye, revile, re|proach others, to bla&s;t their reputation, to rai&s;e or &s;pread ill reports of them; can&s;t thou dare to do this, thinking 'twont be known that it comes from thee, or that it can't be prov'd upon thee? Alas, the great GOD hears, and critically ob&s;erves all this thy wickedne&s;s.

The All&s;eeing eye of thy glori|ous Judge is always upon thee, by Day and by Night, whether alone or in company; let the thought; of this, keep thee from allowing thy &s;elf in any known Sin what&s;oever.

Don't keep what thou ha&s;t gotten in any unju&s;t way, tho' never &s;o &s;ecretly; thou wilt keep the Cur&s;e and Wrath of God on thy Soul, if thou do&s;t.

GOD is now calling on thee and warning of thee to Repent; if thou do&s;t not now take warning, it may be few or no more warnings may be given thee: or if they be, po&s;&s;ibly God may Judicially give thee up to a &s;eared Con&s;cience; and may &s;ay, Let him that is filthy be filthy &s;till, let him that is unju&s;t be unju&s;t &s;till&punc; What if God &s;hould &s;ay, if &s;uch an one, or &s;uch an one does not take warning, repent and reform now; then he &s;hall go on in his &s;ecret ways of wickedne&s;s, and &s;hall be blinded and hardened in Sin, till he drops into the unquenchible flames of the pit below; if God &s;hould &s;ay thus, how dreadful would it be!

<P N="6"><PB N="44" REF="001491_0044_0FB35028DF07B1F0">VI. <HI>We &s;hould not allow our &s;elves in any thing, but what we can give a good account of in the Day of Judgment.</HI> Surely this &s;hould be our greate&s;t Stu|dy and Care, &s;ince our Text tells us, That God will <HI>Give to every one according to his ways.</HI> It may be when we are to manage &s;uch or &s;uch an affair, we think and con&s;ider what to do in it; and we inquire in our own Minds, what will &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons, it may be great Men, or it may be &s;ome intimate Friends or near Relations; what will they think or &s;ay of it, how will they like it? I &s;ay, it may be we are apt to rea&s;on thus with our &s;elves, about what we are going to do (and indeed it may not be improper, in many ca&s;es and cir|cum&s;tances thus to query) but our great inquiry &s;hould be. <HI>How will God like of it?</HI> What will our glorious Judge think of it? Will it plea&s;e him? Then let us do it tho' it di&s;plea&s;e all men. Will it di&s;plea&s;e God? Then let us &s;hun it tho' Men are never &s;o much provok'd thereby. Let us act or not act, as &s;hall be mo&s;t for our Peaceable and Comfortable account, in the great Day of Judg|ment. According as we behave our &s;elves now, &s;o &s;hall we be dealt with here-after. For we are told <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.28, 29. (with which I &s;hall conclude) <HI>All that are in they Graves &s;hall hear his</HI> (that is, Chri&s;t's) <HI>Voice, and &s;hall come forth; they that have done good to the Re&s;urrection of Life, and they that have done Evil to the Re&s;urrection of Damnation.</HI></P>
