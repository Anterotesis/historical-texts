<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of a well regulated government in civil States, is ac|knowledged by all; and the im|portance and benefit of true Chri&s;|tianity, in order thereto, is no le&s;s certain. For the great Author of it a&s;&s;ures us, that his di&s;ciples are the <HI>&s;alt</HI> of the earth, and the <HI>light</HI> of the world, Mat. 5.13, 14. That is, his religion is as nece&s;&s;ary for the well-being of human &s;ociety, as &s;alt is to pre&s;erve from putrifaction, or as light is to direct our way, and to guard again&s;t enemies, confu&s;ion, and mi&s;ery. This is evident, becau&s;e 1&s;t, The univer&s;al rule of equity, enjoined by our Lord, has the mo&s;t natural and effectual tendency to promote exten&s;ive union of any means in the world: And both our friends and our enemies know, that our &s;alvation and welfare, as a people, greatly depends thereupon. 2d, His precepts plainly require, the yielding to all their dues, faithfulne&s;s in every &s;tation, benevolence to all, and the working ill to none. 3d, A regard to all the&s;e things is enforced with the certain promi&s;es of his help and ble&s;&s;ings, for time and eternity, to
<PB N="4" REF="016195_0003_0F9BD3E1F411E138">
tho&s;e who plea&s;e him; and with as &s;ure de|clarations of tribulation and wrath, di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h, upon every &s;oul of man that doeth evil. And who can help &s;eeing, that the&s;e things are as nece&s;&s;ary to the welfare of &s;ociety, as &s;alt and light are for our bodies? But if &s;o, why have &s;uch quarrels and oppre&s;|&s;ions, &s;uch deceit and cruelty, been practi&s;ed for many ages under the Chri&s;tian name? The an&s;wer in general mu&s;t be, becau&s;e many mi&s;takes, and corrupt principles have been covered with that lovely name; of which the following are not the lea&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. A conceit that religion gives the &s;ubjects of it, a right of dominion over the per&s;ons and properties of others. Which is as contrary to the laws of Chri&s;t, as darkne&s;s is to light; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. 10.11&mdash;14. Luke 10.5&mdash;11. 1 Cor. 10.32; 1 Peter 2.12.</NOTE> and is the evil that all <HI>contention</HI> comes from. Prov. 13.10. This moved &s;uch as called them&s;elves Chri&s;tians in Europe, to claim the property of infidels in America; from the poi|&s;on whereof we are not yet thoroughly purged.</P>
<P N="2">2. In&s;tead of holding fa&s;t THE FORM of &s;ound words, which requires our &s;upreme re|gard to God, and the loving of our neighbor as our&s;elves, men have invented A FORM of godline&s;s, to cover <HI>&s;elf-love</HI> with; under which they have been <HI>fal&s;e accu&s;ers, and fierce de&s;pi&s;ers of tho&s;e that are good.</HI> 2. Tim. 1.13 and 3.1&mdash;5. Under this ma&s;k, one generation after another

have ca&s;t the reproach of their own wicked|ne&s;s upon others, and have made a prey of &s;uch as have departed from their evils. I&s;ai. 59.15. And what le&s;s than this, has been done to the Bapti&s;ts, for above two hundred years? It is mo&s;t evident that the mad actions at Mun&s;ter, in 1533, proceeded from a conceit, that the &s;word was then con&s;ecrated to the chri&s;tian cau&s;e, &s;o that tho&s;e who had got it into their hands were to enforce their religi|ous &s;entiments thereby. Which conceit never was admitted by any Bapti&s;t church that we know of, either in Britain or America; yet the ruling parties in both countries, have held that evil fa&s;t, while they have, not only re|proached the Bapti&s;ts with the &s;candals it has produced, but al&s;o have often made a <HI>prey</HI> of them for departing therefrom.</P>
<P N="3">3. By the&s;e means <HI>partiality</HI> has been e&s;|tabli&s;hed by law, and men have been empow|ered to give away the money, and to judge the cau&s;es, of &s;uch as they were <HI>intere&s;ted</HI> again&s;t.</P>
<P>Te&s;timonies again&s;t this iniquity, have not only been given by di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;tab|li&s;hed wor&s;hip in this country, but al&s;o by &s;ome of the greate&s;t men among the congre|gationali&s;ts; tho' little regard was paid there|to. In 1656 the town of Ip&s;wich impo&s;ed a tax upon all the inhabitants, for a mini&s;ter's &s;ettlement, for which di&s;tre&s;s was made.&mdash; Whereupon one of their greate&s;t rulers prov|ed,
<PB N="6" REF="016195_0005_0F9BD3E3C6B90608">
from the fir&s;t principles of government, that repre&s;entatives have no right to give a|way any money, but only for the good of the whole community; and that the taking of it a|way from one per&s;on or party, and giving it to another, was TYRANNY. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ma&s;s. hi&s;tory, vol. 3. p. 291&mdash;309. Bapti&s;t hi&s;t. p. 310&mdash;312.</NOTE> And one of their chief mini&s;ters, who had been attached there|to, till he &s;aw the &s;ame mea&s;ures meted to them again, by the tyrant Andros; was &s;o much enlightened thereby, as to &s;ee, that a man has a right to all his temporal enjoy|ments before he becomes a Chri&s;tian, which he is &s;o far from lo&s;ing by embracing Chri&s;ti|anity, becau&s;e he does not happen to be of the uppermo&s;t party, that he &s;aid, "For an up|permo&s;t party of Chri&s;tians, to puni&s;h men in their temporal enjoyments, becau&s;e they di&s;|&s;ent from them in &s;ome religious opinions, or with an exclu&s;ion from the temporal enjoy|ments which would ju&s;tly belong to them, is a ROBBERY." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Increa&s;e Mathor's life, p. 59.</NOTE> And in the year 1700, he plainly proved, that Chri&s;t has given the right of chu&s;ing all church officers, to the <HI>brethren</HI> in each particular church; from whence he a&s;&s;erted that it would be SIMONICAL to af|firm that this &s;acred priviledge may be pur|cha&s;ed with money. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">His vindication of go&s;pel order, p. 67, 68.</NOTE> And the town of Bo&s;|ton, where he was mini&s;ter, procured a &s;pe|cial

act of the a&s;&s;embly, to exempt them from this &s;imony, which has been impo&s;ed upon the country ever &s;ince. If any enquire how ty|ranny, &s;imony, and robbery came to be in|troduced, and to be practi&s;ed &s;o long, under the Chri&s;tian name? The an&s;wer is plain, from the word of truth. It was by <HI>deceitful rea&s;on|ings</HI> from the <HI>hand-writings</HI> which Chri&s;t <HI>blot|ted out,</HI> and <HI>nailed to his cro&s;s.</HI> Col. 2.8, 14. In tho&s;e writings direction was given to I&s;|rael, to &s;eize the lands and goods of heathens, to make &s;laves of them; and in other re&s;pects, to make a vi&s;ible di&s;tinction in their dealing betwixt their own brethren and all others. A high prie&s;t was al&s;o &s;et up at the head of their wor&s;hip, who, with his family, were to have the whole direction thereof; and at who&s;e &s;entence unclean per&s;ons were to be excluded from their camp; unclean hou&s;es pulled down and removed; and who had power to turn even a king out of the temple. And who can de&s;cribe all the &s;uper&s;tition, blind-devo|tion and church-tyranny, that have been bro't in by deceitful rea&s;onings from thence! Whereas the new te&s;tament plainly &s;hews, that the church of I&s;rael was typical of the elect among all nations. Their literal enemies types of the &s;aints &s;piritual foes, and the gain they made of them, figurative of the advan|tages believers receive from tribulations and per&s;ecutions. That their prie&s;thood were
<PB N="8" REF="016195_0007_0F9BD3E5A0308E08">
types of Chri&s;t and his &s;aints; and officers are never called prie&s;ts in the new te&s;tament, in di&s;tinction from other believers. And in the&s;e and a great number of other in&s;tances, the comparing of type and antitype together, is very in&s;tructive and edifying; but the in|vention of officers, orders, and ceremonies, in the Chri&s;tian church, to an&s;wer to tho&s;e of the Jews; yea, and to exceed them, as the Chri&s;|tian privileges were to be the greate&s;t, is the very way that my&s;tery Babylon was built; which my&s;tery is ever to be known by the&s;e two infallible marks.</P>
<P N="1">1 By not holding THE HEAD, even the ONE LAWGIVER, in whom the church is COM|PLETE; but impo&s;ing <HI>ordinances</HI> upon her, af|ter the <HI>doctrines and commandments of men,</HI> which have a <HI>&s;hew,</HI> but not the reallity, <HI>of wi&s;dom.</HI> Col. 2.10, 19&mdash;22. James 4.12.</P>
<P N="2">2 By not allowing each believer to act <HI>as he has been taught,</HI> but others, <HI>puft up with a fle&s;hly mind,</HI> a&s;&s;ume the power to <HI>judge</HI> for them in religious matters. Col. 2.7, 16&mdash;18.</P>
<P>And can any religious e&s;tabli&s;hment by hu|man laws be found, without, at lea&s;t, the&s;e <HI>marks</HI> of the bea&s;t, and the <HI>number of his name,</HI> which is the <HI>number of a man.</HI> In the typical &s;tate of the church, the number &s;ix, whether in weeks, months or years, was de&s;criptive of &s;ea&s;ons of fatigue and labour, and the &s;eventh
<PB N="9" REF="016195_0008_0F9BD3EC1F66D950">
of each, were re&s;ting times. So the bea&s;t can get no further than the toiling number, whe|ther it be in units, tens, or hundreds. But tho&s;e who had gotten the victory over the bea&s;t, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, were &s;een by John, in his vi&s;ion, &s;tanding upon the &s;ea of gla&s;s, &s;inging the &s;ong of Mo&s;es; and of the Lamb. Rev. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">8 and 15.2, 3. Now as the pure word of God is compared to <HI>gla&s;s.</HI> 2 Cor. 3 18. James 1.23&mdash;25. does not this vi&s;ion re|pre&s;ent the re&s;t and joy that believers will find, upon their getting victory over all the inventions of men, when they &s;hall &s;tand and act intirely upon divine truth, which is as clear as <HI>cry&s;tal,</HI> and enforced by divine in|fluence, compared to <HI>fire?</HI> Jer. 23, 29. Rev. 4, 5, 6. And is it not &s;trictly true to &s;ay, that the whole of the late eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws of this province, were commandments of men, which empowered the ruling party to judge for the re&s;t in religious affairs, and to enforce that judgment with the &s;word. There has been &s;o much of real chri&s;tianity in this coun|try, from its fir&s;t plantation, as greatly to check and re&s;train the poi&s;onous influence of this partiality; but the nature of it is ne|ver the better for that. So far from it, that while &s;ome are trying to cover them&s;elves with all the good things that have been a|mong

us, and from thence are denying that they have oppre&s;&s;ed any; others are catching at tho&s;e evils, to &s;hield them&s;elves again&s;t the truth. Many in the State of Rhode-I&s;land, bol&s;ter them&s;elves up in an irreligious way, by the &s;tories they have heard of the inju&s;|tice and cruelty which the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticuts did to their fathers, under a re|ligious ma&s;k; while that very irreligion is of|ten recurred to, as a prevailing argument for a religious partiality in the&s;e other States. And though we have great cau&s;e of thank|fulne&s;s, for the light, to di&s;tingui&s;h things more clearly, which has lately been granted, and that our honored rules have di&s;covered &s;o much of a regard to equal religious liber|ty; yet, le&s;t the &s;ame &s;hould be fully allowed, I hear that &s;ome plead, that if rulers have no right to e&s;tabli&s;h any way of religious wor|&s;hip for its own &s;ake, they have a right to do it for the good of civil &s;ociety. The import of which plea, in my view, is ju&s;t this viz. That becau&s;e religion is a means of great good to human &s;ociety, therefore rulers ought to improve their power to de&s;troy the means, in order to accompli&s;h the end!</P>
<P>For the whole of religion is to <HI>fear God, and keep</HI> HIS <HI>commandments;</HI> with a realizing view, that HE will bring <HI>every work into judgment, with every &s;ecret thing, whether it be good or evil.</HI> And the teaching of <HI>his fear by the precepts of

men,</HI> is the direct way to confu&s;ion and ruin. Eccl. 12.13, 14. I&s;ai. 29. 13&mdash;21. God has expre&s;sly armed the magi&s;trate with the <HI>&s;word,</HI> to puni&s;h &s;uch as <HI>work ill to their neighbours;</HI> and his faithfulne&s;s in that work, and our obe|dience to &s;uch authority, is enforced by tho&s;e great motives. Rom. 13.1&mdash;10. 1. Tim. 2.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, 3. But it is evident, that the &s;word is ex|cluded from the kingdom of the Redeemer, and that he gave this, as a &s;ufficient proof, why it did not interfere with the government of civil &s;tates. John 18.36. And it is im|po&s;&s;ible to blend church and &s;tate together, without violating our Lord's commands to both. His command to the church is, <HI>Put away from among your&s;elves that wicked per&s;on.</HI> His command to the &s;tate is, <HI>Let both grow together until the harve&s;t.</HI> 1. Cor. 5.13. Mat. 13.30, 38&mdash;43. But it has appeared for the&s;e thou|&s;and years, that pure go&s;pel di&s;cipline in the church, is very little, if at all known, in &s;tate e&s;tabli&s;hments of religion; and that in&s;tead of letting conformi&s;ts thereto, and di&s;&s;enters therefrom, grow together, or enjoy equal worldly privileges, the &s;word has been em|ployed to <HI>root up,</HI> and to <HI>prepare war again&s;t,</HI> all &s;uch as put not into the mouths of the e&s;|tabli&s;hed teachers, who are the means of up|holding &s;uch rulers as <HI>pervert all equity.</HI> Jer. 5.31. Micah. 3.5&mdash;11. It is now well known among us, that the having of temporal pro|perty
<PB N="12" REF="016195_0011_0F9BD3EFD29C9E30">
in our own power, &s;o as not to have it taken away without our con&s;ent, is the turn|ing point of all civil freedom. And it is evi|dent, from the above pa&s;&s;ages, and many others, that the arming any to take it away with the &s;word, under a religious ma&s;k, is the greate&s;t engine of tyranny in the world.</P>
<P>The celebrated Bi&s;hop of Gloce&s;ter wrote a volumn, about forty years ago, wholly upon this argument, that rulers ought to keep up a religious e&s;tabli&s;hment for the good of civil &s;ociety. He owns that the church was origi|nally a &s;ociety, di&s;tinct from, and independent of the &s;tate: But denies her being <HI>complete</HI> without an alliance therewith. Which is a plain mark of the bea&s;t, as I have before proved. The motives that he &s;ays, the magi&s;|trate has, for taking the church into alliance, are to pre&s;erve the e&s;&s;ence and purity of religion, to apply its influence for the good of the &s;tate, and to prevent the mi&s;chief it might otherwi&s;e occa&s;ion thereto. To prove that the magi&s;|trate &s;hould be concerned to pre&s;erve the pu|rity of religion, he &s;ays, <Q>Ob&s;erving <HI>truth,</HI> is acting as things really are; he who acts as things really are mu&s;t gain his end; all di&s;|appointment proceeding from acting as things really are not.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Warburton's alliance between church and &s;tate.

he is &s;o far from proving that point, that up|on another turn of his di&s;cour&s;e, he flatly de|nies it; and, in order to prove that his &s;cheme did not interfere with the right of private judgment, he po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts, that for rulers to e&s;tabli&s;h any religion becau&s;e it is the truth, is <HI>unju&s;t,</HI> as they have no right to judge for others in &s;uch matters; and al&s;o that it is <HI>ab&s;urd,</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch an end could be at|tained thereby; as the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion all the world over will be the magi&s;trates; that is, &s;ays he, <Q>For one place where the <HI>true</HI> religion is e&s;tabli&s;hed, the <HI>fal&s;e</HI> will be e&s;|tabli&s;hed in a thou&s;and.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 248, 249.</NOTE> And when he was told of this ab&s;urdity, he had no better way to an&s;wer it, than by &s;aying, <Q>I mean a <HI>legitimate</HI> policy, that ever pur&s;ues common utility.</Q> Of which it &s;eems he did not &s;up|po&s;e there was above one in a thou&s;and.

And were can that party now find &s;uch mini&s;|ters, to inforce their laws as the famous Cot|ton, Hooker, Norton, Mitchel, and others were? yet with all that help, their e&s;tabli&s;h|ment was &s;o weak, when it was fifty years old, that one of their greate&s;t mini&s;ters compared it to a <HI>&s;mall boat,</HI> and only one Bapti&s;t &s;ociety in the colony, to the balla&s;t of a <HI>great &s;hip,</HI> which would &s;ink it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bapti&s;t hi&s;tory p. 494, 544.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">II. The influence of religion is now again&s;t them. The two capital points of purity and liberty that our fathers came to this country for, are, that none &s;hould be received to full communion without a credible profe&s;&s;ion of regeneration; and that a particular church thus con&s;tituted is the highe&s;t religious judi|cature upon earth, to whom councils are on|ly advi&s;ory. But thirty-nine years after Bo&s;ton was &s;ettled, a number of mini&s;ters a&s;|&s;i&s;ted in forming a church there; in open <HI>&s;e|peration</HI> from the fir&s;t church in the town, be|cau&s;e the new invention of the half-way co|venant was excluded therefrom. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 388, 405.</NOTE> And the apo&s;tacy prevailed &s;o fa&s;t, for thirty years, as

to move Dr. Increa&s;e Mather then to declare, that if it &s;hould do &s;o for thirty years more, the mo&s;t con&s;cientious people in New-England would think them&s;elves concerned to <HI>gather churches out of churches.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vindication of go&s;pel order. p. 12.</NOTE> It was then become a matter of di&s;pute, whether any church was intitled to the protection of the laws, if &s;he refu&s;ed to be controuled in the choice of mi|ni&s;ters, by other mini&s;ters, and the pari&s;h. And forty four years after, that que&s;tion was de&s;ided in the negative, when, becau&s;e the fir&s;t church in Canterbury refu&s;ed to receive the mini&s;ter they had provided for her, a <HI>&s;e|parate</HI> church was formed in the place, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A like <HI>&s;eparation</HI> was made at Middleborough the &s;ame year.</NOTE> and &s;aid mini&s;ter was ordained over it; and no better encouragement was given to the fir&s;t church, by the ordaining council, than only the u&s;e of their influence with the legi&s;lature of the colony, that &s;aid church <HI>might obtain all legal religious privileges</HI> whenever they de&s;ired it. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fi&s;h's examiner examined. p. 76.</NOTE> And becau&s;e they did not de&s;ire any new incorporation from the &s;tate, but only protection from injuries, their goods were &s;poiled, and their per&s;ons impri&s;oned, for fif|teen years to &s;upport a mini&s;ter they never cho&s;e, and had no more relief afforded to them, either by mini&s;ters, or civil officers, than the

prie&s;t and levite gave to the man that fell among thieves. Con&s;cientious people in other places waited a year, after Canterbury church was thus &s;tripped of all legal privileges, and then began to gather churches out of churches in imitation of the fir&s;t churches of this coun|try. And though their mini&s;ters have often been reproached with the name of <HI>lay-teach|ers,</HI> yet we can prove, that their ordinations were derived, in a direct line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, from the bapti&s;t mini&s;ter that Dr. Mather helped to ordain in Bo&s;ton in 1718 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is mentioned to &s;ilence their cavils, and not becau&s;e our au|thority depends upon a local line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> And now, within the&s;e ten years, it has plainly appeared, by their own publications, that the mini&s;ters who are mo&s;t earne&s;t to keep up their eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, are again&s;t requiring a profe&s;&s;ion of regeneration in order for full communion; and that they hold, that when a mini&s;ter is &s;ettled in any pari&s;h, the court mu&s;t compel them to &s;upport him, until he, or other mini&s;ters, con&s;ent to his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, even though the church &s;hould convict him of &s;candalous immoralities. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bapti&s;t hi&s;t. p. 109, 110.

<P N="3">III Sen&s;ible experience is again&s;t tho&s;e laws. Under our fir&s;t charter earne&s;t attempts were made to e&s;tabli&s;h the government of the church over the world; and under the &s;econd, to e&s;tabli&s;h the power of the world over the church. But the effects of both have been &s;o pernicious, that many cannot bear to hear of them; and have made bitter complaints a|gain&s;t me for publi&s;hing &s;ome of them to the world. But if it be a crime in me to <HI>publi&s;h</HI> them, what mu&s;t it be in tho&s;e who <HI>committed</HI> them! And will any now plead for a practice either under the name of religion, or of doing good to human &s;ociety, that will not bear the light! Canterbury, Plainfield, and A&s;hfield, after u&s;ing violent methods to &s;upport their

mini&s;ters, have been con&s;trained to di&s;mi&s;s each of them, and to come down to a friendly way of treating their neighbours, whom they had injured thereby; and, in &s;undry in&s;tan|ces, to confe&s;s their faults to them. And a|mong the many hundred in&s;tances of making di&s;tre&s;s for mini&s;ters &s;upport in our day, I have not heard of one, but what has cau&s;ed &s;ome conviction of the impolicy, if not of the im|piety, of that practice.

Jer. 5.31. Micah 4.5&mdash;12. The Epi&s;copalians covered their pleas for hav|ing bi&s;hops e&s;tabli&s;hed in America, with many plau&s;ible pretences; but their wi&s;dom failed them. For in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e pleas they have owned, that a bill for that purpo&s;e had almo&s;t got through the parliament when Queen Ann died, which was defeated thereby. And that though their party have been watch|ing ever &s;ince, they never could find &s;uch a|nother favourable opportunity, 'till now in 1767. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chandler's appeal, p, 50&mdash;54.</NOTE> And tho&s;e who are ver&s;ed in the hi&s;tory of the nation know, that the liberties thereof were in eminent danger when the &s;aid Queen died, which never were in &s;o great danger &s;ince, till the &s;cheme was invented to tax America; upon which, it &s;eems, Bi&s;hops were to have been &s;ent over. To prevent which Dr. Chauncy plainly denied that any &s;tate had a right to make religious e&s;tabli&s;hments. And though they tried to defend that right, yet, in reply to it, he &s;aid, "The religion of Je&s;us, has &s;uffered more from the exerci&s;e of this
<PB N="22" REF="016195_0021_0F9BD3FD4D103918">
pretended right, than from all other cau&s;es put together; and it is with me, pa&s;t all doubt, that it will never be re&s;tored to its primitive purity, &s;implicity, and glory, until religious e&s;tabli&s;hments are &s;o brought down as to BE NO MORE" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chauncy's reply to Chandler's defence. 1770. p. 144, 145.</NOTE> The&s;e are the words of the mini&s;ter, who has written the mo&s;t, for the&s;e 40 years, to uphold the e&s;tabli&s;hment we complain of, of any man upon earth. And when I mentioned his fir&s;t denial of that right la&s;t fall, a writer appeared in the Bo&s;ton Ga|zette of November 2, and charged me with <HI>ignorance,</HI> for calling their eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, an e&s;tabli&s;hment; and with <HI>impudence</HI> and <HI>abu&s;e,</HI> for writing again&s;t them. And on Dec. 28, he &s;aid, "In our laws, which relate to the &s;ettlement and &s;upport of mini&s;ters, I am not able to find any thing that has the appearance of e&s;tabli&s;hment. All the various denominations of Prote&s;tants are treated <HI>alike</HI>&mdash;all Prote&s;tants are, therefore, in the view of our laws, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A more glaring fal&s;hood could not be uttered than this.</NOTE> EQUALLY orthodox." Now as our legi&s;lature have con&s;tantly called tho&s;e laws an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, for the&s;e eighty-&s;even years, they are involved with me, in this charge of ignorance; and as the party they were made for, refu&s;ed to own the truth in that re&s;pect, it &s;eems that our honored Repre&s;entatives thought it high time to di&s;card <HI>&s;uch learning,</HI> and to appoint
<PB N="23" REF="016195_0022_0F9BD402CA9E2F78">
a mini&s;ter to preach to them, who was in <HI>truth</HI> a friend to the liberty others made a <HI>fal&s;e</HI> pretence of. True wi&s;dom is, therefore, &s;o far from favouring tho&s;e laws, that the <HI>folly of fools</HI> has been now made u&s;e of to up|hold them. Prov. 14.8. And can they &s;tand upon &s;uch a bottom! Men have three things to be concerned for, namely, &s;oul, body, and e&s;tate. The two latter belong to the magi&s;|trate's juri&s;diction, the other does not. There is a learned profe&s;&s;ion &s;uited to each of the&s;e intere&s;ts; yet every man and every woman have long been allowed that liberty, about phy&s;icians and lawyers, that has been denied them about &s;oul-guides. And can my dear countrymen any longer &s;uffer officers to do that out of their province, which they dare not do in it!</P>
<P>As no man can have a right to judge for others in &s;oul-affairs, &s;o they never could con|vey &s;uch a right to their repre&s;entatives; there|fore, all the taxes, to &s;upport religious wor|&s;hip, and judgements in &s;uch ca&s;es, that have been among us, were a taxing of us where we were not repre&s;ented, and impo&s;ing jud|ges upon us who were intere&s;ted again&s;t us. Which mea&s;ures God has again meted to this country in a mo&s;t terrible manner. Self-love, under the &s;pecious name of government, and a concern for the public good, has moved,
<PB N="24" REF="016195_0023_0F9BD403C79A4DE8">
and now moves, the Britons, to act towards us like incarnate devils. And &s;elf-love in this country, by &s;inking our public credit, has expo&s;ed us to greater danger, than all their fleets and armies could do. The &s;word, di|rected by wi&s;e councels, has been the grand means of our defence again&s;t tho&s;e invaders; and infidels mu&s;t &s;ee, that an invi&s;ible power has turned the &s;cale in tho&s;e matters, one way and the other, from time to time, entirely out of the reach of human fore&s;ight. And how &s;trong is the argument from hence, for faithfulne&s;s in all rulers, to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them; and faithfulne&s;s in their con&s;titu|ents, to &s;upport them therein? yea, and for faithfulne&s;s al&s;o in mini&s;ters and people, to|ward each other, as they will an&s;wer therefor to the Judge of all. It was before proved, that the u&s;e of the &s;word, again&s;t &s;uch as work ill to their neighbours, is expre&s;sly warranted by the new-te&s;tament. And the time when it is to be laid a&s;ide is plainly marked out in the prophecies; namely, when the <HI>knowledge of God</HI> &s;hall have &s;uch exten&s;ive influence, that there &s;hall be <HI>none to hurt or de&s;troy,</HI> or even to <HI>make us afraid,</HI> I&s;aiah 11.9. Micah 4.1&mdash;4. In the mean time, the Redeemer has exclud|ed the &s;word from his kingdom, which he gives as the rea&s;on why it does not interfere with the government of <HI>worldly</HI> &s;tates. John

18.36. And how can any be true mini&s;ters of his kingdom, who cannot be content with all the &s;upport that his laws and influence will give them! Although the comfortable &s;upport of religious mini&s;ters, is mo&s;t expre&s;&s;|ly required, both in the old and new te&s;ta|ment; yet the u&s;e of force to collect it, and again&s;t tho&s;e who have te&s;tified again&s;t that practice, has produced &s;uch effects in all ages, as none have been willing to own. But the Judge cannot be deceived by their deceitful coverings; and tells us all what will become of tho&s;e who <HI>allow</HI> of &s;uch deeds, again&s;t plain light to the contrary. Mat. 23.29&mdash;33. Luke 11.46&mdash;52.</P>
<P>Rulers, mini&s;ters and people, have now a fair opportunity given them, to turn from and quit them&s;elves of tho&s;e evils; and I cannot but hope they will improve it. Eight years ago &s;elf-love, under a religious pretence, had &s;uch influence in our legi&s;lature, that we had no way left, to &s;ave our friends in A&s;hfield from being robbed of their lands, but by an appeal to Britain. And if that evil &s;hould be ingrafted into our new plan of government, we &s;hould have no con&s;titutional remedy again&s;t it left upon earth: For the Congre&s;s refu&s;e to be judges of &s;uch matters. We know that Tories had then the chief ma|nagment of tho&s;e deceitful and cruel proceed|ings

again&s;t us; and al&s;o that the king and council, did not give relief in that ca&s;e, from a regard to equal religious liberty, (which they deny at home) but for other ends. Therefore we have joined as heartily, in the general defence of our country, as any deno|mination therein; and I have a better opini|on of my countrymen, than to think the ma|jority of them will now agree, to deny us liberty of con&s;cience.</P>
