<HEAD>TO <HI>SYLVANUS,</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_LATELY reading the little Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Five Indian Nations,</HI> I met with a Pa&s;&s;age in it, which I thought worth par|ticular Notice. It is this, <Q>I &s;uppo&s;e our Interpreters were not Poets enough to tran&s;late the Songs, otherwi&s;e I might have gratified the Reader with a Ta&s;te of Indian Poetry.</Q></P>
<P>I have enquired whether any &s;uch Songs could be found, as I know that you are curious in &s;uch Things; and the&s;e, which I now &s;end to you, &s;ince came to Hand.</P>
<P><HI>Maratho</HI> is named for the Originals, and <HI>Yariza,</HI> and that is all that I can tell you of them at pre&s;ent, but I &s;hall make further Enquiry. This much I can tell you now, that &s;ome que&s;tion whether <HI>Yariza</HI> compos'd her Part, or only &s;ung it. The Di&s;pute is not very material; but if there be &s;uch a Genius, as we are told, among the <HI>Indians,</HI> I know not why the gentler Sex, may not be &s;uppo&s;ed to partake of it, e&s;pecially, on Subjects &s;uitable to their Gentlene&s;s.</P>
<P>They &s;eem to have been de&s;igned on Occa&s;ion of promulging the la&s;t General Peace.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="007217_0004_102B3EEFA8A18CE0">
<Q>What Time is this for them? (&s;ays a Critic) Why did they not come &s;ooner?</Q></P>
<P>And, (if it be civil to an&s;wer one Que&s;tion by a&s;king another, but what &s;hall one do with captious Critic's) why were they not a&s;k'd for, or enquir'd after &s;ooner? Perhaps they are come full &s;oon, for any Thing that will be thought of them.&mdash;Perhaps it is the Fa&s;hion of Indian Writers, to keep their Compo&s;ures by them for &s;ome Time, to correct and poli&s;h; and well it were for &s;ome others, and for their Readers, that they would do likewi&s;e. Better Pieces, than they are, have lain by many more Years, before they have made their Appearance.&mdash; <Q>Ay,&mdash;but it looks &s;u&s;picious, that <HI>Yariza</HI> &s;ays nothing of Prince <HI>Frederick,</HI> who was living at that Time.</Q></P>
<P>There might be a Rea&s;on given for that,&mdash;her Thoughts were taken up;&mdash;&s;he was lamenting the Death of the Queen;&mdash;admiring the Prince&s;s,&mdash;now Prince&s;s Dowager:&mdash;And is it not natural for the Female Kind, much to &s;et by tho&s;e of their own Sex, who are highly eminent?</P>
<P><Q>Very well,&mdash;but to &s;peak of the young Prince, and not to mention his Father, a Prince &s;o noble, hu|man, beneficent, of &s;uch Appearance and Hopes.</Q></P>
<P>Alas!&mdash;the&s;e Critics love to perplex Matters.&mdash;I &s;hall leave them to ob&s;erve to you, that the&s;e Songs or Odes, call them which you plea&s;e, by their Air and Accent, appear of Indian Extraction They abound with that Phra&s;eology. The Tree, the Chain, the Hou&s;e of Peace, the great <HI>Sachem</HI> for the <HI>King,</HI> the great Lake for the Ocean, <HI>Corlaer</HI> for the Governor of the Province, <HI>Manhaten</HI> for <HI>New-York,</HI> you very well know are Terms in U&s;e with them.</P>
<P><HI>The Book of Peace,</HI> if they are not u&s;ed &s;o to call the Book there intended, I think it would be nothing ami&s;s to learn them to call it &s;o; and I can not appre|hend that the Tran&s;lator, granting that he found not
<PB N="5" REF="007217_0005_102B3EF131CA0C48">that Expre&s;&s;ion in the Original, but added it, is to be blamed for &s;uch an Addition.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e that the Writer of the&s;e Odes only took Hints from the Indian, and that they are far from be|ing a clo&s;e Tran&s;lation; yet, ought we not to e&s;teem the Indian Genius, which could give &s;uch Hints to him?</P>
<P>The Author of the little Hi&s;tory of the&s;e Nations, &s;ays of them, to his Excellency Governor <HI>Burnet,</HI> to whom he dedicates it; that tho' they were under the darke&s;t Ignorance, yet, <Q>a bright and noble Genius &s;hines thro' the&s;e black Clouds.</Q></P>
<P>He goes on to &s;ay, that, <Q>none of the greate&s;t Ro|man Heroes have di&s;covered a greater Love to their Country, or a greater Contempt of Death, than the&s;e Barbarians have done, when Life and Liberty came in Competition.</Q></P>
<P>In another Place he &s;ays, that, <Q>if Care was taken to plant in them, and cultivate that general Benevo|lence to Mankind, which is the true Principle of Virtue,&mdash;they would no longe: de&s;erve the Name of Barbarians, but would become a People who&s;e Friend|&s;hip might add Honour to the Briti&s;h Nation.</Q></P>
<P>What Pity is it, that &s;uch a Genius &s;hould be &s;unk or depraved, which, if it was reliev'd and rightly cul|tivated, might &s;hine out to them, and to us, with Ad|vantage and with Honour.</P>
<P>Would not &s;uch cultivating of it, tend to the Good of the Publick, not only of this Province and tho&s;e Nations, but promote the <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI>&mdash;the Chri&s;tian In|tere&s;t?</P>
<P>To this might be conducive, if &s;ome Per&s;on capable of furthering &s;uch an Intention, were encouraged to &s;et|tle for &s;ome Time in tho&s;e Parts, to attain the Lan|guage, if he has it not already, and under proper Direc|tion to in&s;titute Schools, or, at lea&s;t, in the mean Time, one good School for Education, and to enquire for the
<PB N="6" REF="007217_0006_102B3EF2BAA6FBF0">fitte&s;t Per&s;ons to recommend to the Care and Charge of it.</P>
<P>If there is already a School there; for I do not pre|tend to be well acquainted with the pre&s;ent Di&s;po&s;ition of Affairs in tho&s;e Parts, there might be another &s;et up at a convenient Di&s;tance; and it may not be ami&s;s, to &s;et one or two good Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es over a &s;eparate School of Girls. Much would depend on the Improving and Refining that Sex, to reclaim and civilize the other.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Schools, &s;ome of the mo&s;t Ingenious and Docile of the young Indians might be in&s;tructed in our Faith and Morals, and Language, and in our Methods of Life and Indu&s;try, and in &s;ome of tho&s;e Arts which are mo&s;t u&s;eful.</P>
<P>The&s;e, that is, &s;ome of the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ed and quali|fied of them, might in Time be &s;et over other Schools, for it may be thought not unfitting, that there were one, at lea&s;t, for every Nation, or rather for each of the Tribes, which are reckon'd three in every Nation.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, the Youths &s;o forming, might be profitable, each in the Family which he belongs to, where he might be look'd upon as a young In&s;tructor, and frequently be &s;o,</P>
<P>This, likewi&s;e, might help to prevent Teachers be|ing &s;ent among them by another Nation, which has been done formerly, and has been found prejudicial.</P>
<P>Our Hi&s;torian, Mr. <HI>Colden,</HI> tells us, pag. 69. <Q>We may &s;till ob&s;erve the Influence, which the <HI>French Prie&s;ts</HI> had obtained over the other Nations, and to what Chri&s;tian-like Purpo&s;es they u&s;ed it.</Q></P>
<P>Tho&s;e other Nations, page 70, are the <HI>Onandagas, Cayugas,</HI> and <HI>Oneydoes,</HI> three of the Five; and the Purpo&s;es were &s;piriting them up again&s;t other Indians, Friends of <HI>Virginia,</HI> whom they made War on, and kill'd &s;ome of the People of <HI>Virginia</HI> who a&s;&s;i&s;ted tho&s;e Indians.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="007217_0007_102B3EF529F3DA58">
And p. 71. By the Influence of one of them, nam'd <HI>Milet,</HI> a Je&s;uit, on the <HI>Oneydoes,</HI> they were frequently turn'd again&s;t the Southern Indians, Friends of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Southern Colonies.</P>
<P>The&s;e Quotations, I hope, will not &s;eem tedious to you. This Ob&s;ervation may ari&s;e from them, that &s;ince there have been, and &s;till are Men &s;o indu&s;trious, for &s;ecular Ends (at lea&s;t, &s;uch their De&s;igns appear to us) as to compa&s;s Sea and Land, to make Pro&s;e|lytes; it will be becoming in us to attempt more ex|ten&s;ive Methods for enlightning the Under&s;tanding, and reforming the Way of Living of tho&s;e People, to which we are urg'd by a Variety of the be&s;t Mo|tives.</P>
<P>To civilize our Friends and Neighbours; &mdash; to &s;trengthen our Allies and our Alliance;&mdash; to adorn and dignify Human Nature;&mdash;to &s;ave Souls from Death; to promote the Chri&s;tian Faith, and the Divine Glory, are the Motives.</P>
<P>There is yet another which may incline our Hearts to the&s;e People, and that is, the great Love which they expre&s;s to Peace. Is there a Nation under Heaven, which &s;peaks of it in more complacent and pathetic Terms?</P>
<P>No Wonder, if their young Men of Genius, their Bards or Druids, like <HI>Maratho;</HI> their young Maids of fine natural Qualities, like <HI>Yariza;</HI> No Wonder, if they &s;hould frame Songs of Peace, when the old Men, the <HI>Sachems,</HI> &s;peak of it with &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ion and Rapture, that their Speech &s;eems a poetical Language; a Kind of divine Enthu&s;ia&s;m.&mdash;</P>
<P>What do you think, Sir, would it not be worth a Philo&s;opher's While to come from <HI>Europe,</HI> to &s;ee the&s;e Nations of Peace-Lovers, and to conver&s;e with them, and if he could purcha&s;e &s;ome Slips or Suckers of their Tree of Peace? Would it not be well done to take them back with him, and recommend them to the
<PB N="8" REF="007217_0008_102B3EF6B3FB5F80"><HI>European Regions?</HI> The Princes there u&s;e to be fond of foreign Rarities.&mdash; What if the precious Tree was propagated in the Gardens at <HI>Ken&s;ington?</HI> What if in tho&s;e at <HI>Vienna, Marli,</HI> the <HI>Arranjuez,</HI>&mdash;<HI>Pot&s;dam?</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Not that tho&s;e Imperial and Royal Gardens, are &s;uppo&s;ed now to want Trees or Plants of &s;uch Kind,&mdash;happy, if they take Root and flouri&s;h,&mdash;if they be duly cultivated;&mdash; if the great Owners water them with their own Hands: Nor is that beneath their Dignity, if they look on them as their Garden's chief Ornaments, and Delight to meditate the Good of Mankind, under their Shadows: &mdash; But, &s;till, &s;uch Slips from hence might be favourably received as an exotic Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>I return to the <HI>Five Nations.</HI> That you may not think that I magnify their Love of Peace: Read their own Words, &s;peaking of the Tree of Peace, in one of their Orations, in the 3d Chap. of the Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><Q>We now plant a Tree, who&s;e Top will reach the Sun, and its Branches &s;pread far abroad, &s;o that it &s;hall be &s;een afar off, and we &s;hall &s;helter over &s;elves under it, and live in Peace without Mole&s;tation.</Q>&mdash;p. 67. <Q>The Tree of Peace is planted &s;o firmly that it can not be moved.</Q> p. 89. they &s;ay, <Q>That they &s;hall Dance to the Calumet of Peace, under its Leaves, and &s;hall remain quiet.</Q></P>
<P>In like Language, they &s;peak of the Chain, which &s;eems to &s;ignify with them, a League of Peace or Alli|ance.</P>
<P>Page 60. <Q>We gladly catch at, and lay hold of the Chain, which we de&s;ire may be kept clean and bright like Silver.</Q> p. 67. <Q>Now we have a new Chain, a &s;trong and a &s;traight Chain that cannot be broken,&mdash;Let us on both Sides hold the Chain fa&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Is it not a Pity that People, who &s;eem &s;o much to love Peace, &s;hould not be further'd in the be&s;t Methods of pre&s;erving it inwardly in their Minds, as well as in their
<PB N="9" REF="007217_0009_102B3EF8C5DD5F90">outward Condition? I doubt not, but that the worthy Man, who was there formerly, did his Endeavour, and that he who is now there does the &s;ame; but what is one Man to &s;uch Multitudes?</P>
<P>Should they not be more exten&s;ively acquainted with the Doctrine and Precepts of the Prince of Peace, by the Knowledge and Ob&s;ervance of which, they would be led into tho&s;e &s;erene Regions, where their beloved Tree flouri&s;hes with a &s;weet Odour for ever?</P>
<P>Should not Schools and Oratories be &s;et up in &s;un|dry Parts of the <HI>Indian Nations,</HI> or, at lea&s;t, as has been &s;aid before, one or two principal Ones, from whence others might derive, as from &s;ome beneficent Springs-Head flows a Stream, which becomes a great River to refre&s;h an exten&s;ive Country, and make glad the Hearts of a populous Nation?</P>
<P>Where are the Men, who de&s;ire, like the Heroes and Law-givers of Antiquity, to re&s;cue Nations from Barbarity; like the cho&s;en Mi&s;&s;ionaries, to propagate the Divine Light, which came to enlighten the World: Is it not becoming them to appear in &s;uch an Under|taking?</P>
<P>However u&s;eful one, or another might be in the immediate Parts: Do you not think, <HI>Sylvanus,</HI> that &s;uch an Intention would require the chief Men of the Province, for Pre&s;idents and Conductors of it? Should not the leading Men of the Neighbouring Colonies, de&s;ire to a&s;&s;ociate in it; the rather as the Welfare and Security of tho&s;e Colonies as well as of this, &s;eem to have &s;ome Connexion with a right In&s;titution of the&s;e Indians?</P>
<P>It is not improbable that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Society, on proper Application, would further encourage it. Nor is it to be doubted, but that &s;ome in high Stations in <HI>Britain,</HI> would promote it.</P>
<P>The Court, the Nobles, and Gentlemen there, many of whom are of the fine&s;t Ta&s;te and Expre&s;&s;ion, in the
<PB N="10" REF="007217_0010_102B3EFAB76770F0">various Kinds of Eloquence, might, in Con&s;equence of this, in a little Time, expect from hence, finer Indian Odes, than what are now pre&s;ented to them.</P>
<P>But if they think little of the Songs of <HI>India,</HI> (as in|deed the&s;e Tran&s;eripts, at lea&s;t, are not much to be thought of, whatever Originals may be) yet, it is be|coming them to advance the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity; and it is not unworthy of their Care, to promote, by all proper Means, the Maintaining the Ballance of Power in <HI>America,</HI> as well as in other Parts of the World.</P>
<P>An Objection has been rai&s;ed by &s;ome Gentlemen, not again&s;t the Expediency of this Work, but becau&s;e of the Difficulty of it.</P>
<P>They repre&s;ent the <HI>Indians,</HI> as an untractable People, very tenacious of their own Manners and Fa&s;hions.</P>
<P>If &s;uch an Attempt and Performance were very ea&s;y, there would be the le&s;s Honour in accompli&s;hing it. But neither can I imagine it &s;o very difficult. Very wild and &s;avage Nations have been reformed; therefore, the Indians, who are nothing &s;o Savage, may be reformed. One or two Men, have &s;ometimes done a great deal towards civilizing the Manners of a People. What may not be done by the eminent Men of a large Pro|vince, in Conjuction? Perhaps to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome of their be&s;t Neighbours, and &s;upported by a high En|couragement.</P>
<P>How much have &s;ome wild People, &s;uch formerly, improved in other Countries within this Century, and &s;ome in half that Time. What need to &s;peak of other Nations and of ancient Ages? Mr. <HI>Colden,</HI> who&s;e Book I open again, &s;eems to think the <HI>Indians</HI> like other People. <Q>I am fond to think, &s;ays he, that the pre&s;ent State of the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, exactly &s;hews the mo&s;t ancient and original Condition of almo&s;t every Nation.</Q> If the Original be the &s;ame, why may there not be a like Progre&s;s, e&s;pecially in a People,
<PB N="11" REF="007217_0011_102B3EFD036B2710">who &s;eem to have an innate Di&s;po&s;ition to Science, and who breathe untaught Eloquence?</P>
<P>Then,&mdash; that Love of Liberty and Honour;&mdash; that <HI>Roman,</HI>&mdash; that <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Spirit:&mdash; They &s;eem naturally akin to us,&mdash; be&s;ide our Alliance,&mdash; let us help our Brethren. If the rough Gem throws out &s;ome Sparks of Light, how will it &s;hine when poli&s;h'd! If the Tree appears fair in the Verdure of its Leaves, will not the Blo&s;&s;oms and Fruits make it look more lovely!</P>
<P>Speaking of Trees, minds me of two Lines in <HI>Vir|gil,</HI> which &s;eems applicable to this Subject.</P>
<P>Exuarint Sylve&s;trem animum, Cultuque frequenti, In qua&s;eunque voces Artes, hand tarda &s;equentur.</P>
<P><HI>The &s;avage Mind, by Culture when &s;ubdu'd, Will with the nobler Arts be &s;oon imbu'd.</HI></P>
<P>But there is no Occa&s;ion for <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Skill in grafting to prolong this Di&s;cour&s;e. &mdash; Perhaps it is too tedious, I would not multiply Words.</P>
<P>My reading Mr. <HI>Colden,</HI> and tran&s;cribing the Indian Songs, rais'd the&s;e Thoughts in me. I imagin'd, that communicating them might be of Service. It is rot for me to proceed any further: If what is written &s;eems for the Good of the Publick; the Ways and Means; the proper Method,&mdash;that lies before others.</P>
<P>It may be, at the next A&s;&s;embly, if it &s;hall &s;eem good to them; a Committee will be appointed to en|quire into the State of the <HI>Indian Nations,</HI> and into the be&s;t Methods for pre&s;erving, and &s;trengthening, and improving our Alliance with them.</P>
<P>Perhaps, &s;ome will &s;ay, &s;uch Cares &s;hould begin at Home; that it becomes them chiefly to provide for the Education of their own Youth; and that they are to con&s;ider of erecting and endowing a &s;tately Edifice &s;uitable to that Purpo&s;e.&mdash;It is very well,&mdash;wherefore &s;hould they not?&mdash; But it is noble to have exten&s;ive Views; That they may do; and yet not leave the other unders. They may look to the Welfare of their
<PB N="12" REF="007217_0012_102B3EFF44DC4B10">Families, and to the Honour and Advantage of the Province.&mdash; Wherefore &s;hould they not?&mdash; For this they have Dwellings in the&s;e Lands, and Seats in that Council.</P>
<P>But, at the &s;ame Time, they may comprehend, and deliberate on the promoting, more largely the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, and the Cau&s;e of Humanity, of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>This would give a peculiar Lu&s;tre to their A&s;&s;embly. This would be to ri&s;e Forts and Bulwarks on their Bor|ders. This would be to make their Province and City, a Name and a Prai&s;e on the Earth.&mdash; This would be in|deed, more fully, to entitle them to the dear Appel|lations of Fathers and Patriots.</P>

<HEAD>A POSTSCRIPT</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the <HI>EDITOR.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>YARIZA's Letter, which came lately to Hand, it is hoped, will not be di&s;agreeable to the prin|cipal Ladies to whom it is directed.</P>
<P>To judge of it by the Stile and Sentiments, it &s;eems no le&s;s genuine than the other Pieces. It may be reckon'd more rare. We have had before now Pro|ductions of the Oratory of the Male <HI>Indians,</HI> but this, perhaps, is the fir&s;t of the Female.</P>
<P>Some may imagine the Whole to be from <HI>Maratho:</HI> But why &s;hould we doubt &s;ome of the <HI>Indian</HI> Women having &s;ome Genius for Poetry and Oratory, when we know there are of the Sex, eminent in tho&s;e Arts, in other Countries.</P>
<P>One would think that there is a peculiar Delicacy and Tenderne&s;s, &s;uitable to the Sex, which di&s;tingui&s;hes what is a&s;crib'd to <HI>Yariza.</HI> Her Song appears to have a more pathetic Simplicity.</P>
<P><HI>Maratho</HI> &s;peaks briefly of the Tree of Peace, and then of the Chain of Concord, and of the Grave or Pit of War; nay, he blu&s;ters a little of the Ax ri&s;ing again, as if War was not yet quite out of his Head. <HI>Yariza</HI> is all Gentlene&s;s, and &s;eems loth to remove her Contemplations from the delightful Tree.</P>
<P>At the very fir&s;t, there appears a Concern for it, le&s;t being of heavenly Origin, it &s;hould not grow kindly here on Earth, le&s;t the Drought, or Fro&s;t, or Storms &s;hould injure it. The Leaves, the Blo&s;&s;oms and Fruits, are all mentioned in &s;uch a Manner, as &s;hew her Fondne&s;s for it.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="007217_0024_102B3F19CA8BF768">
The Birds of &s;weete&s;t Voice, and the gentle&s;t Crea|tures embelli&s;h it. Wheels and Looms are its Deco|rations.</P>
<P>But here ari&s;es a Difficulty: It &s;eems doubtful whe|ther &s;he can be warranted in her De&s;ign to go to Court, and in her &s;peaking of the great Per&s;onages.</P>
<P>Is this Propriety of Sentiment? It is very &s;ure, &s;he might have heard of the Queen, and Prince&s;s, and of the young Prince, and how dear they were to <HI>Britons:</HI> But did it become her to attempt their Eulogies? The whole Affair is &s;ubmitted to the Ladies and to the Critics, only, let them remember in her Favour, that &s;he did not intend to go to Court without a fine Web along with her.</P>
<P>Altho' the Solemnity of the Occa&s;ion might lead her &s;he appears there but as by Accident. She do's not depend on any Songs compo&s;ed by her or <HI>Maratho,</HI> to introduce her, but on good Hu&s;wif'ry.</P>
<P>She makes but a &s;hort Vi&s;it to lament the ab&s;ent Brightne&s;s, and to take Comfort from that which is pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>She &s;oon returns to the fair Tree, which &s;eems dearer to her than the Grandeur of a Court, than the Pomp of Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>She had look'd undazzled on royal Splendor, and on an illu&s;trious Progeny. But here &s;he is in Raptures She invokes the Earth, the Air, and Heaven.&mdash; She appears no longer as an <HI>Indian</HI> Maid, the untaught <HI>Yariza,</HI> but as a <HI>Sybil,</HI> or rather a Prophete&s;s in a divine Tran&s;port, while &s;he extends her Hands, and looking up, ble&s;&s;es the King and Nations.</P>
<P>Has &s;he not communicated her Rapture? Is not this Comment &s;mit with her Enthu&s;ia&s;m? &mdash; Be it &s;o,&mdash; perhaps &s;uch Enthu&s;ia&s;m is not blameable.</P>
<P>However, would it not be well done by tho&s;e, to whom her Letter is addre&s;s'd, yet to encourage her to go to Court; or after &s;ome Time, direct thither
<PB N="25" REF="007217_0025_102B3F1C2E4B2E58">others of the <HI>Indian</HI> Maids, who &s;hall become mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd, with &s;ome of their &s;ine Indu&s;try.</P>
<P>Such a Pre&s;ent, it may be well imagined, would not be unacceptable to the chief Ladies of the Court of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;uch a Motive, be&s;ide many others, and the Benefit thence to ari&s;e to them&s;elves might influence tho&s;e of the Fair Sex here, who have it mo&s;t in their Power, to promote the In&s;truction and Improvement of the Female <HI>Indians.</HI> As for the Men, it is hoped that they will take Care of the Male Sex; and &s;hould the gentler Kind, who are allow'd to have a greater Share of Tenderne&s;s be outdone on &s;o fair an Occa&s;ion for their Emulation: &mdash;But, perhaps, <HI>Yariza</HI> is too long detained from her Addre&s;s to them.</P>

May each of you have in your Habitations, a fair Shrub, or little Tree, as a Family Tree of Peace, to ble&s;s your Dwellings. May the Exhalations from it, be as the &s;weet Odour of In|cen&s;e, or as the Leaves of the &s;weete&s;t Trees in the Fore&s;t, to gladden your Apartments. Let no rude Sounds of Di&s;cord or Di&s;quiet, be as a blighting Wind to wither the Leaves thereof. No Di&s;tre&s;s nor Diffi|dence, like a thick Fog, ca&s;t an unkindly Mildew to taint them, but the Man's Eyes, like the Sun-Beams, chear its Roots, and the Woman's Voice, as a gentle Breeze, fan and regale the Branches. Let her draw deep into her Brea&s;t the Bal&s;am of its Effluence, and her Lips breathe forth and improve the Fragrance.</P>
<P>How gladly would the <HI>Indian</HI> Maids attend on you in your (high Wigwams) great Hou&s;es, to learn &s;ome|what of your Gracefulne&s;s and Goodne&s;s, to watch the Bidding of your fine Eyes, and wait on the Beckoning of your fair Hands! &mdash; But we are not worthy, till bet|ter fa&s;hion'd, Send us, therefore, we pray ye, &s;ome good Women, who may teach us tho&s;e Sounds, wherein you utter your Commands and Meaning, that we may perfectly under&s;tand, and be the more &s;it to attend to them, and who may learn us &s;ome-what of the Per|formances of the fine Needles, wherein your&s;elves are &s;o excellent; and who may direct us in tho&s;e Ope|rations for the Looms, wherein your Maid-Servants are in&s;tructed.</P>
