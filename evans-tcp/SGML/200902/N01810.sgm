<HEAD>A <HI>PREFACE</HI> Of the very Reverend Dr. <HI>Increa&s;e Mather.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN Mens <HI>Defaming</HI> their Neighbours (E&s;|pecially &s;uch as have de&s;erved better u&s;age,) there is no Little Evil. Not only does our Saviour CHRIST in&s;truct us <HI>to do as we would be done by,</HI> but the moral Philo&s;o|pher among the Gentiles, by the Light of Na|ture, Says, <HI>Quod tibi fieri non vis alteri ne &s;e|ceris.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, as Great an Evil as it is, many are guilty of it: And many of the Best and mo&s;t Serviceable Men in the World, have been Expo&s;ed unto it. The Holy Prophets <HI>heard the Defaming of many.</HI> The Apo&s;tles of our Lord <HI>JESUS CHRIST, being Defamed,</HI> yet Ble&s;&s;ed tho&s;e that were mo&s;t Abu&s;ive to them. Nor was there ever any Man in the World mere <HI>Defamed,</HI> than He that has been
<PB N="ii" REF="002143_0004_0FBC22BAF930EE20">the <HI>SAVIOUR</HI> of it; who has taught His Di&s;ciples to <HI>Forgive their Enemies,</HI> to <HI>Ble&s;s tho&s;e that Cur&s;e them,</HI> and to <HI>Do Good unto tho&s;e that Hate them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>ESSAY</HI> now to be offered unto the Rea|der was Printed at <HI>London</HI> Nine Years ago. But I never &s;aw it until within the&s;e few Days; nor li&s;t I to Enquire after the Author. I find in it not only <HI>Erudition</HI> and <HI>Ingenuity,</HI> but that which is a thou&s;and times better, a Go&s;pel Spirit of Real Piety: And that the Author (whoever he be) is a Per&s;on of Great Reading and Acquaintance with Learned Writers; and has made his Knowledge &s;ub&s;ervient unto his Religion. I have therefore advi&s;ed the Re|printing of it in <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> Hoping that GOD will ble&s;s it, both for the <HI>Conviction</HI> of them who are concerned as <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors,</HI> and for the <HI>Confolation</HI> of them who may be concerned as <HI>Sufferers,</HI> by <HI>Defamations.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE Occa&s;ion of the En&s;uing ESSAY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT has been Earne&s;tly wi&s;h'd by &s;ome, yea, it has been the</HI> fir&s;t-born <HI>of their Wi&s;hes,</HI> That whatever &s;pecial Temptation and Affliction befalls them, the Glorious Lord may have &s;ome Revenues of Glory; yea, and his People al&s;o &s;ome Revenues of Service from it. <HI>There are tho&s;e who have &s;een their</HI> De&s;ire <HI>in this Thing remarkably</HI> Accompli&s;hed; <HI>and it has been</HI> Sweet <HI>unto them; it has remarkably</HI> Sweetned <HI>the</HI> Bitter|ne&s;s <HI>of all their</HI> Exerci&s;es. I would ye &s;hould under&s;tand, Brethren, that the Things which happen'd to me, have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the Go&s;pel. <HI>But then, if we are at any time Exerci&s;ed with Injurious</HI> De|famations, <HI>why &s;hould not this</HI> Temptation <HI>and</HI> Affliction <HI>be improved as well as the Re&s;t, and the</HI> Church <HI>of Chri&s;t, wherein the CASE occurs to</HI> all that will live Godlily, <HI>be Inte|re&s;ted, (<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> we can attain to it) in the improve|ment of it?</HI></P>
<PB N="iv" REF="002143_0006_0FBC22BD5D16A7C0">
<P><HI>It is a Plea&s;ant Critici&s;m of</HI> Cocceius, <HI>that the Church is Compared unto a</HI> Garden of Nutts; <HI>partly becau&s;e Good Men mu&s;t, like</HI> Nutts, <HI>be well</HI> knock'd <HI>and</HI> broken, <HI>before o|thers can get that</HI> Good <HI>which is to be gotten out of them. If the Reader get any</HI> Good, <HI>by an</HI> ESSAY <HI>now put into his Hands, let him A|dore the Faithfulne&s;s of the Glorious LORD, who Order'd a Servant of his, to be</HI> knock'd <HI>with &s;ome Calumnies and Reproaches; which awakened him, (in&s;tead of</HI> An&s;wering <HI>and</HI> Confuting <HI>them, as 'tis Ea&s;y for him to do.) to &s;et him&s;elf upon</HI> Strengthening his Bre|thren <HI>with a Di&s;cour&s;e on a CASE, wherein very many are concerned. It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd that he had al&s;o in this</HI> ESSAY, <HI>a very particu|lar Eye to</HI> Another <HI>Servant of God, who&s;e</HI> Watchfulne&s;s <HI>and</HI> Faithfulne&s;s <HI>and</HI> Indu&s;try, <HI>had not Excu&s;ed him from</HI> unkind u&s;age <HI>(which every wi&s;e Man looks for) in an</HI> Evil World. Plutarch <HI>wrote a Treati&s;e,</HI> De Ca|pienda ab ho&s;tibus utilitate; <HI>how</HI> to Profit by ones Enemies. <HI>But</HI> Plutarch <HI>was a Stran|ger to &s;uch Maxims as this</HI> ESSAY <HI>is Compo|&s;ed of. And both the Author and his Friend, has great cau&s;e to take Satisfaction in the Di|vine</HI> Providence, <HI>that has brought them forth, for the Service of the People to whom we owe our</HI> All.</P>
<P><HI>The Famous</HI> Dod, <HI>had been &s;o greatly</HI> Defa|med <HI>by an Officer of the</HI> College <HI>whereto he
<PB N="v" REF="002143_0007_0FBC22C05155A710">belonged, that his vexation upon it, threw him into a Fever. But God Sanctified it for &s;o much</HI> Good <HI>unto him, that he &s;ort for his</HI> De|faming Accu&s;er; <HI>and for the &s;ake of the</HI> Good <HI>he had gained by him, heartily forgave him all the</HI> Wrong <HI>he had Suffer'd from him.</HI> Anon <HI>the Accu&s;er him&s;elf &s;aw and own'd his</HI> Error. <HI>If the Author of this</HI> ESSAY, <HI>may not only</HI> gain <HI>the</HI> Good <HI>propos'd in it; but al&s;o</HI> do <HI>the</HI> Good <HI>that is intended by writing of it; he will have Superabundant Rea&s;on to</HI> forgive <HI>tho&s;e that have been abu&s;ive to him; yea, tho' instead of a &s;maller Number, and worthier of a better Name, their Name were</HI> Legion.</P>
<P><HI>Among other A&s;&s;aults upon him, he has had fir&s;t and la&s;t above a dozen</HI> Pamphlets <HI>Pub|li&s;hed again&s;t him; unto any one of which, he never made the lea&s;t Reply; except it were that which the Univer&s;ity of</HI> Helm&s;tadt <HI>lately made unto an Abu&s;e put upon them,</HI> Vi|&s;um e&s;t non alio Remedio quam genero&s;o Silentio, &amp; pio contemptu, utendum nobis e&s;&s;e; (<HI>Silence and Contempt they thought the be&s;t</HI> Reply.) <HI>This</HI> un-replying Silence <HI>has not proceeded from the</HI> Weakne&s;s <HI>of his Cau&s;e, but from the</HI> Strength <HI>of it. For what lo&s;s of Time is it, [ill to be &s;pared out of a</HI> Short Life!] <HI>to draw a</HI> Saw <HI>with a People who have no Rea|&s;on or Honour in them?
