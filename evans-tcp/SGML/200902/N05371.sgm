<HEAD>THE SAD TENDENCY OF DIVISIONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<Q><BIBL>MATT. xii. 25.</BIBL>
<P>&mdash;<HI>Every Kingdom divided again&s;t it&s;elf, is brought to De&s;olation; and every City or Hou&s;e divided against it&s;elf, &s;hall not &s;tand.</HI></P></Q>
<P>THE Occa&s;ion of the&s;e Words, is inti|mated in the fir&s;t Part of the Ver&s;e: They are Chri&s;t's Reply to a bla&s;phemous and &s;candalous In&s;inuation of the Phari&s;ees. We have an Account in the 22 ver. of Chri&s;t's ca&s;ting out a Devil from a Per&s;on who was made blind and dumb by him, and his healing the Man; in&s;omuch, that the whole Multitude were amazed, and glorified God, and cried, <HI>Is not this the Son of</HI> David, <HI>i. e.</HI> the promi&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="006797_0004_1029A3B54A3290B0"><HI>Me&s;&s;iah?</HI> The Matter of Fact <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> as plain as the Sun; and the Phari&s;ees could not deny, but it was an extraordinary Thing, and &s;uper|natural: And they could no Way avoid the Conclu&s;ion, That this was the Son of <HI>David,</HI> out by &s;ugge&s;ting, that VChri&s;t ca&s;t out Devils by <HI>Beelzebub;</HI> that there was a Compact be|tween him and the Devil, and pur&s;uant to this, the Devil was not properly ca&s;t out, but did voluntarily retire, and give back with De&s;ign. This was the la&s;t Refuge of an ob&s;tinate Infi|delity, that was re&s;olved to &s;tand it out again&s;t the cleare&s;t Conviction. Chri&s;t's Reply to this ba&s;e Imputation, is copious and cogent; that (as Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> notes)
<Q>Every Mouth may be &s;topped with Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on, before it be &s;topped with Fire and Brim&s;tone.</Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Argument is in my Text, in which our Lord &s;hews them, That it would be very &s;trange, and was highly improbable, that Satan &s;hould be ca&s;t out by &s;uch a Compact, becau&s;e then his Kingdom would be divided again&s;t it&s;elf; which is a Thing, con&s;idering his Sub|tilty, not be imagined: Wherefore, Chri&s;t's lays down a known Rule, univer&s;ally approved by the Rea&s;on and Con&s;ciences of all Sorts of Men, That in all Societies, a common Ruin is the Con&s;equence of mutual Quarrels. <HI>Every Kingdom divided against it&s;elf, is brought to De|&s;olation;</HI> and &s;o is every Society and Family

This, the great <HI>Roman</HI> Orator, and Phi|lo&s;opher, ob&s;erves as a Thing obvious, and ne|ce&s;&s;arily re&s;ulting from the Nature of the Thing. <HI>Quae enim Domus tam Stabilis e&s;t, Quae tam firma Civitas, quae non odiis, et di&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">is, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">unditus Evecti po&s;&s;it?</HI> What Hou&s;e is &s;o &s;table, What City &s;o firm, which by Hatred and Di&s;|&s;ention, may not be utterly overthrown?

<P>DOCT. <HI>Divi&s;ions and Contentions in Churches, as well as other Societies of Men, tend to, and if con|tinued in, do bring on their Ruin and De&s;olation.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent, purpo&s;ely con&s;ider how they tend to the Ruin of other Societies; de&s;igning e&s;pecially to con&s;ider how they tend to the Ruin and De&s;olation of Churches.</P>
<P>The&s;e are Societies of Men combin'd toge|ther by a Religious and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity, and &s;o partake of the common Nature of King|doms, and Cities, and other Societies of Men; and the Propo&s;ition which Chri&s;t lays down here, is univer&s;al, a known Rule, with Re&s;pect to all Societies, and holds with Re&s;pect to Churches, as well as others.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="006797_0006_1029A3BBCA9D3190">
I &s;hall propo&s;e &s;everal Con&s;iderations, to &s;hew and illu&s;trate the Truth of this A&s;&s;ertion, and then make &s;ome Application.</P>
<P N="1">1. Such Divi&s;ions and Contentions tend to increa&s;e the Allenation of particular Members, from one another, where Churches and Church Members are joined together, as they ought to be, according to the Apo&s;tle's Rule. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1, 10. <HI>Now I be&s;eech you, Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that ye all &s;peak the &s;ame Thing, and that there be no Divi&s;ions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the &s;ame Mind, and in the &s;ame Judgment,</HI> then will be no Divi&s;ions among them. All Divi&s;ions and Contentions mu&s;t take their Ri&s;e from difference of Sentiments, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Alienation of Affection of one Per&s;on from another; the Continuance of the&s;e, tend to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> them more and more; they tend to beget and in|crea&s;e hard Thoughts, and unkind Su&s;picions of one another's Actions and Principles. When Church Members are divided, they are apt to grow &s;trange to one another, to conver&s;e cau|riou&s;ly or &s;hily with, and be afraid to tru&s;t one another; they are ready to entertain Jealou&s;ies of one another, that this and that Man had &s;ome De&s;ign again&s;t them, and is aiming to under|mine and counteract them: For in Divi&s;ions and Contentions, the different Parties have different De&s;igns in View; from whence natu|raily
<PB N="7" REF="006797_0007_1029A3BD4F16C718">ari&s;e Jealou&s;ies of each other, and Su&s;pi|cions that their Neighbours and Brethren who differ from them, de&s;ign to overthrow their Purpo&s;es, and defeat their Intentions; and even the&s;e Jealou&s;ies and Su&s;picions which ari&s;e in their Minds, do of them&s;elves increa&s;e the Alienation of their Affections, and &s;till &s;et them at a farther Di&s;tance; and tend either to break off all Communication, or to render what they have, an angry, or a &s;ly, cautious, and de&s;igning Thing, and at length to i&s;&s;ue in open and declared Enmity. <HI>Two cannot walk toge|ther, except they be agreed,</HI> Amos 3.3.</P>
<P N="2">2. Such Divi&s;ions tend to many Sins, and &s;inful Carriages of Brethren and Members towards one another.</P>
<P>As they create and increa&s;e Jealou&s;ies and Su&s;picions of one another, the&s;e tend to break out into &s;inful Actions. While they wrongly interpret one another's Views and De&s;igns, they fo&s;ter the Imputation of &s;ome Crime upon their Brethren, which they are not guilty of; aggravate their Infirmities, and account, and treat them as gro&s;s and wilful Sins: They di&s;|po&s;e their Minds to put the wor&s;t Con&s;truction upon tho&s;e Actions which &s;eem to be bad, and to put bad ones upon tho&s;e Actions which are really Virtuous and Religious. Divi&s;ions tend to &s;tir up Anger, and Wrath, Clamour, and Evil-&s;peaking. When the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="006797_0008_1029A3C095A16250">heard that their Brethren had built an Altar on t'other Side <HI>Jordan,</HI> they pre&s;ently concluded that they were turning away from the Lord, and thereupon readily concluded to go to Wa|again&s;t them, <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 22 12 When <HI>Ziba</HI> fawn'd upon <HI>David,</HI> and flatter'd him, and he let in evil Thoughts of <HI>Mephibo&s;heph,</HI> he pre&s;ently gave Credit to <HI>Ziba</HI>'s Lye, and unju&s;tly, and without an Hearing, gave away his Land to <HI>Ziba.</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 16.3, 4. Hence &s;uch Cautions and Warnings are given to God's People, <HI>Lev.</HI> 19.18. <HI>Thou &s;halt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the Children of thy People, but then &s;hall love thy Neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI> Prov. 10.12, 18. <HI>Hatred &s;tirreth up Strifes; but Love covereth all Sins. He that bideth Hatred with lying Lips, and he that uttereth Slander, is a Foel.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Such Divi&s;ions and Contentions among Brethren, tend to deprive them&s;elves, and one another, of the Means of their Spiritual Edi|fication.</P>
<P>The next and immediate Work of Conten|tion, is to break off, and put an End to that Chri&s;tian and Brotherly Conver&s;ation which Chri&s;tians ought to maintain, to in&s;truct, com|fort, and edify one another. Contentions break off mo&s;t, if not all of this Sort of Conver&s;ation; and if the Shadow of it is kept up, 'tis com|monly turn'd into Di&s;putes and Debates about reconciling their Words and Actions, one Side
<PB N="9" REF="006797_0009_1029A3C3D18CAD00">charging Crimes, the other ju&s;tifying and de|fending them&s;elves; the I&s;&s;ue of which, is often a Wrangle, and greater Di&s;&s;ention, and &s;o one great Means of mutual Edification is at an End, and then follows &s;uch Alienation of Affection, and hard Thoughts of one another, that they can't hold Communion together any longer. One thinks the other too bad, and too little of a Chri&s;tian, to have Communion with him; either that his Principles or Practices are &s;uch, that he can't join with him in any Thing, and the other pre&s;ently thinks as hardly of him. Be&s;ides, they often bring on &s;uch an Alienation and Di&s;affection, that one will not promote the common Edification of the Body, and will re|fu&s;e his Part of the Charge of it, perhaps chiefly becau&s;e 'tis in a Way which the other propo&s;es or chu&s;es. He concludes it can't be right, be|cau&s;e that Man, or that Party which propo&s;es it, mu&s;t needs be wrong; and having deter|mined before, that they are bad Men; and have bad De&s;igns, he is well &s;atisfied, that what they are pur&s;uing, can't be good. By the&s;e Means, they are in Danger to drop the In&s;titutions of Chri&s;t, and the ordinary Means he hath ap|pointed for their Edification and Salvation. So they tend to break the Bands of Church Socie|ties, and crumble them to pieces, in full Oppo|&s;ition to the Direction of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.3, 4. <HI>Let nothing be done through Strife or Vain|glory,
<PB N="10" REF="006797_0010_1029A3CAC0BC85B8">but in Lowline&s;s of Mind let each <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> other better than them&s;elves. Look not every Man on his own Things, but every Man al&s;o on the Things of others.</HI> Contrary to his Direction, and his Example, propo&s;ed for our Imitation, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.32, 33. <HI>Give none Offence; neither to the</HI> Jew <HI>nor the</HI> Gentile, <HI>nor to the Church of God. Even as I plea&s;e all Men in all Things, not &s;eeking mine own Profit, but the Profit of many, that they may be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. They tend to root out true Religion, and &s;ub&s;titute the Principles of Party Quarrels in the Room of it.</P>
<P>True Religion is the great End of the Coalition and Combination of Churches, and the Bond which is to hold them together, are the Terms of the Covenant of Grace; and the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> or true Religion, does not <HI>con&s;i&s;t in Meat and Drink but in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost,</HI> Rom. 14.17, 19 Now when Divi&s;ions and Contentions get into Churches, and they break into Parties, 'tis a Wonder, if pre&s;ently they don't &s;et up the particular Party Opinions they embrace, as the great Fundamentals of all Religion, and lay the main Stre&s;s of it upon tho&s;e peculiar Opi|nions which they hold, if it be but in Matters of Church Di&s;cipline, or Terms of Church Communion, or the peculiar Explication of &s;ome non-e&s;&s;ential Doctrine of Religion, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="11" REF="006797_0011_1029A3CC5492BD28">human Words of their own Stamp and Stand|ard. The Chri&s;tian Church has &s;een many a Time &s;ad Evidence, what Havock the&s;e Things have made of Religion: While the &s;everal Parties have &s;kated and canonized tho&s;e that came to their Standard, and fall in with their peculiar Sentiments and Explications, and re|nounced, un&s;ainted, and cur&s;ed all that do not. Men's Di&s;putes and Debates turn upon the Principles of the Party, and they are apt to lay the main Stre&s;s upon them; by which Means, the great and e&s;&s;ential Things of Religion, are in a Manner forgotten, or neglected. True Faith, real Holine&s;s, fervent Love to God and Man, &s;incere, univer&s;al Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Charity, are apt all to be comprehended, and thought to be included in &s;ome Party Notions and Explications, and &s;o Religion, by not &s;low Degrees, dwindles away into Form, and a fu|rious Party Zeal; and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> carnal World are either confirm'd in their Apprehen&s;ions, that there is nothing in Religion, but the Pa&s;&s;ions, and worldly Intere&s;ts of Men; or that it lies in &s;uch Things as are at be&s;t but meer Appen|dages and Circum&s;tances of it: Such, we &s;ee, was the Tendency of the Contentions of the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.11, 12, 13. which occa&s;ioned that fervent Expo&s;tulation of the Apo&s;tle. <HI>For it hath been declared unto me of you, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Brethren, by them which are of the Hou&s;e

<P N="5">5. They tend to quench the Spirit of God, and provoke him to withdraw from them.</P>
<P>The gracious Pre&s;ence of God, and the Agency of his Holy Spirit, is the Life of all Religion in the Church in general, and in every parti|cular Church. It he is withdrawn, the Church may keep up a Form of Religion, but they will have nothing of the Power and Life of it. Now Divi&s;ions and Contentions are &s;ad Means to quench the Motions of the Holy Spirit in Men's Hearts, and drive Him away. The Spirit of God, that ble&s;&s;ed Dove, is a Spirit of Peace: He does not dwell and conver&s;e much in Souls that are much exerci&s;ed in Pa&s;&s;ion, Pride, Contention, and Strife. The&s;e are not his Fruits, but infinitely abhorrent to him; and tend to &s;tifle and bear down the good Mo|tions and Impre&s;&s;ions he makes on the Heart, and to provoke him to withdraw. <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.19, 23. we find reckon'd among the Works of the

Eph.</HI> 4.3, 4, 5, 6. They will &s;oon become carnal <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, having little of God with them; and hold together, or break in Pieces, ju&s;t as they apprehend their carnal Intere&s;ts, and worldly De&s;igns, are &s;erved or di&s;&s;erved, and according to their Pa&s;&s;ions, Prejudices, and Party De&s;igns; which you may ea&s;ily &s;ee, is their Ruin and De&s;olation.</P>
<P N="6">6. Divi&s;ions and Contentions tend to make Churches contemptible to others, and a Prey to Satan, and de&s;igning Men.</P>
<P><HI>To be terrible as an Army with Banners,</HI> is one Part of that fair and beautiful Character by which the Church is de&s;cribed, <HI>Cant.</HI> 6.4. When Churches are heartily united on the true Principles of their Union, they give &s;uch Te|&s;timony again&s;t Sin; &s;uch Te&s;timony of the Holine&s;s of God, and of the Efficacy of the
<PB N="14" REF="006797_0014_1029A3D4394DE818">Blood of Chri&s;t, and the Virtue of the &s;ancti|fying Spirit, as is a Terror to evil Men, and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors: Their Con&s;tancy, Courage, and Firmne&s;s in the Cau&s;e of God, and the glori|ous Truths of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, &s;trikes an Awe upon the Spirits of carnal and wicked Men, and makes them tremble at the Excel|lency and Power of Religion, and dread the Con&s;equences of Unbelief and Impiety. But when they are crumbled, broken, and divided into Factions and Parties, they become con|temptible to tho&s;e that are without, who are apt to look upon them as different Parties of Hypocrites; proud, conceited, de&s;ign|ing Men, and treat them with Scorn, de&s;pi&s;e their Di&s;cipline, and the Te&s;timony they pre|tend to give for Religion, as a Tool to &s;erve their Pa&s;&s;ions, and promote their Party De|&s;igns. They become a Reproach to their Neighbours, and a Scandal to Religion, and are moreover greatly expo&s;ed to the Tempta|tions of Satan, who watches Advantages by Means of their Pride and Pa&s;&s;ion to betray them into Sin, to &s;et up them&s;elves in the Room of Chri&s;t, and to &s;ub&s;titute their own Honour in&s;tead of his, to lead them into many Mi&s;takes about their Duty, and the great Doc|trines and Intere&s;ts of Religion. When their Eyes are already much darkned by Prejudice, Self-Intere&s;ts, and Self-Will, Satan ea&s;ily gets

Several other Particulars might be mention'd, to &s;hew that Divi&s;ions and Con|tentions tend to the Ruin and De&s;olation of Churches, as well as other Societies; but the&s;e I hope are enough to give you &s;ome &s;en&s;ible Conviction of the Truth, and the Weight of Chri&s;t's Words, That <HI>every Kingdom divided again&s;t it&s;elf, is brought to De&s;olation; and every City or Hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf, &s;hall not &s;tand.</HI></P>
<P>USE 1. Hence Chri&s;tians and Churches &s;hould dread Divi&s;ions and Contentions among them&s;elves. Since they have &s;uch a bad Ten|dency to their Ruin and De&s;olation, they ought to have a great Dread of them, and watch again&s;t the Beginnings, and all Occa&s;ions of them; for when once they are let in, 'tis not ea&s;y to fore&s;ee their End: This is agreeable to the Direction of the Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>Prov.</HI> 17.14. <HI>The beginning of &s;trife, is as when one letteth out Water; therefore leave off Contention before it be meddled with.</HI>

<P N="1">1. Contentions in Churches are a great Re|proach and Di&s;honour to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Sometimes Men are apt to make light of Religious Contentions, and even to boa&s;t of them as the natural and nece&s;&s;ary Re&s;ult of true Religion; as what Chri&s;t has fore-told con|cerning the Event of the Go&s;pel, <HI>Matt.</HI> 10.14, 35. <HI>Think not that I am come to &s;end Peace on Earth; I came not to &s;end Peace, but a Sword. For I am come to &s;et a Man at Variance again&s;t his Father, and the Daughter again&s;t her Mother, and the Daughter-in-Law again&s;t her Mother-in-Law.</HI> We are not to under&s;tand that Chri&s;t came to make Quarrels in his own Church, or to &s;et his own Di&s;ciples at Variance with one another. He did not come to give temporal or carnal Peace, and worldly Pro&s;perity, as they then &s;eem'd to think he did. His Errand was not to give his Di&s;ciples temporal Power, Ea&s;e, and Wealth, in this World. No! He came to give us Peace with God, Peace in our Con&s;ciences, Peace with our Brethren. Tho' <HI>in the World</HI> (he &s;ays) <HI>ye &s;hall have Tribulation.</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="006797_0018_1029A3E14AEA5790">If all the World would Heardly receive Chri&s;t, and his Doctrine, there would be an univer&s;al Peace: But while there are &s;o many that reject him, who are the Children of the World, and the Seed of the Serpent, the Children of God mu&s;t expect to feel their Enmity. The Quar|rels and Contentions there are among Men, are not the Fruit of the Go&s;pel, but of the Lu&s;ts of tho&s;e who do not cordially receive it. The mo&s;t violent and implacable Feuds, have been tho&s;e which have ari&s;en about Religion. The Go&s;pel proves the Occa&s;ion of Divi&s;ions; but it is not becau&s;e there is any Tendency in the Religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to make Men un|peaceable, but becau&s;e Men's Lu&s;ts oppo&s;e the peaceable, pure, and holy Doctrines which he teaches them. But all Chri&s;tian Churches pro|fe&s;s to be Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, who is the Prince and Author of Peace; and are &s;olemnly bound by Covenant, to obey his Will, and be govern'd by his Laws; and their Di&s;&s;entions and Quarrels are a &s;ad Evidence, that they are not as they &s;hould be: That either &s;ome of them are Hy|pocrites, or at le&s;t, that they are not &s;o much under the Power of Chri&s;t's Laws, and po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd with the true Principles of his holy Reli|gion as they ought to be; and they &s;candalize the Name of Chri&s;t, as if he was the Patron of their Contentions, and reproach his holy
<PB N="19" REF="006797_0019_1029A3E68DE65980">Religion, as if Devotees of it might live in &s;uch Wrath, Variance, Emulations, and Strife, as he declares are <HI>not the Works of the Spirit, but of the Fle&s;h,</HI> Gal. 5.20. As if when he bids Chri&s;tians, <HI>Jude</HI> 3. <HI>to contend earnestly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</HI> he gave them a Licence to quarrel with their Brethren, to call them hard Names and to injure and hurt them by Force or Craft, becau&s;e they &s;ee not as they do, or think differently from them, in tho&s;e Things wherein they think the E&s;&s;ence of Re|ligion does not lie; whereas Chri&s;tians are only to contend for the Faith, by &s;ound Doctrine, &s;trong Arguments, holy Lives, plous Exam|ples, firm Patience, and deep Humility, in bearing all the Evils they meet with from an evil World, in the Way of their &s;tedfa&s;t and per&s;evering Obedience to the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Divi&s;ions and Contentions in Churches, do much harm to others, as well as to their own Souls. The Divi&s;ions and Contentions of the vi&s;ible Body of Chri&s;t, are, as has been &s;aid, great Hindrances to their own mutual Edification. They are al&s;o a &s;ad Stumbling to weak Chri&s;tians, and expo&s;e them to many Temptations, and Means of their uncharitable, uncomfortable, and unholy Walking. And they prove an Occa&s;ion of Ruin to &s;ome, and
<PB N="20" REF="006797_0020_1029A3E9D8A19290">perhaps many poor Souls, and harden them in their Unbelief, and Athei&s;m. 'Tis no uncom|mon Thing to hear the Reproach of In&s;iders again&s;t Religion, on Account of the unpeace|able Behaviour of profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians. 'Tis not very &s;eldom they may be heard to &s;ay of them, That there are &s;uch Differences among them&s;elves in their own Doctrines and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of Religion, that there can be no Certainty in them: That there are &s;uch &s;ierce Debates, &s;uch Heats, Animo&s;ities, and envious, and &s;elfi&s;h Controver&s;ies, contrary to the Doctrines of Peace and Love, Patience and Forbearance, which they all pretend to acknowledge, that it evidences none; but the more weak and &s;im|ple believe them, and &s;o they conclude that it is all Impo&s;ture. When carnal Men &s;ee the vi&s;ible Body of Chri&s;t bringing forth like Fruits, as the carnal World do, &s;pringing from a bitter, per&s;ecuting, cen&s;orious, impatient, re|vengful Spirit, in like Works of the Fle&s;h, as Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Stri&s;e, Sedi|tions, Here&s;ies, they believe there is no more Religion in one than the other; and &s;o they &s;ink in Athei&s;m, and are confirmed in their Rejection and Neglect of Chri&s;t, and his di|vine Doctrine. Wherefore Churches, and particular Chri&s;tians, &s;hould dread the&s;e Things, as they would love and promote the
<PB N="21" REF="006797_0021_1029A3975F476E58">Honour of their Divine Ma&s;ter; and dread what&s;oever tends to the Reproach and Scan|dalizing of his &s;acred and precious Name, who has bid them <HI>be one,</HI> and pray'd that they <HI>might be one, as he and his Father are one.</HI> If tho&s;e who have been long engaged in Contentions and Divi&s;ions, think 'tis too late for them to be warned of the Danger, and excited to dread the beginnings of them: However, 'tis not too late to dread the Mi&s;chiefs of them, and &s;eek Deliverance.</P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;tians and Churches &s;hould be greatly concerned to heal Divi&s;ions among them&s;elves. How far foever any Churches have gone in Divi&s;ions, 'tis to be hoped 'tis not too late to entreat you to put an End to them, and to u&s;e the Means of healing. 'Tis not too late to put the Que&s;tion to you, which <HI>Abner</HI> did to <HI>Joab,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam</HI> 2.26. <HI>Shall the Sword devour forever? Knowest thou not that it will be Bitterne&s;s in the latter End?</HI> If Divi&s;ions have gone far, 'tis &s;urely Time to &s;ee if there be no Balm in <HI>Gi|lead,</HI> if there be no Phy&s;ician there.&mdash;Hoping that &s;uch Churches and Per&s;ons are heartily concern'd to have the Hurt of the Daughter of God's People healed, let me propo&s;e to your Con&s;ideration, &s;ome Means of healing.</P>
<P N="1">1. See that an hearty De&s;ire of God's Glory, and the Advancement of the Intere&s;ts of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, rule in your Hearts.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="006797_0022_1029A3F0570737C8">
If, my Brethren, you be all actuated and governed by a &s;upream Love of God, and Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, and if a &s;incere De&s;ire of his Glory, and the Advancement of the great, e&s;&s;ential Intere&s;ts of Religion, do govern your Hearts (and I am per&s;uaded there is not a Man or you, who either does not pretend it does, or at le&s;t owns it ought to be &s;o), Divi&s;ions and Contentions then will &s;oon cea&s;e. There's nothing in the World will &s;o calm your Pa&s;|&s;ions, &s;weeten your Tempers, and bring all your Self-Will, worldly Intere&s;ts and Preju|dices to the Foot of Chri&s;t, and make you willing to forego them all for that one great and common Intere&s;t, the Edification and Salvation of the Body. This will make you willing to &s;acrifice every private and Party Intere&s;t to the Honour of God, and the common Good. If the great, nece&s;&s;ary, all-concerning Things of Religion may be pre&s;erved, and the common Good promoted, you will not think it of any great Con&s;equence, whether it be in a Way exactly, and in all Circum&s;tances agreable to your Mind or not; for God's Glory, and the common Salvation, will appear to you to be Things infinitely greater than your own Will or Humour, or particular Opinions, or any particular Intere&s;t of yours. This will mo&s;t effectually teach you, not to &s;eparate any In|tere&s;t,

This will do abundance, to convince you that Religion di&s;dains the narrow Limits of a Party. And if Men may be brought to Union with Chri&s;t by true Faith, &s;incere Love. If they be made &s;incerely holy and obedient, and you your&s;elves abound in Chri|&s;tian Virtues, it is worth all the Intere&s;ts of this World; yea, that they are nothing in Compari&s;on with it: All other Concerns would run into this great one, like Rivers into the Sea, which would &s;wallow up all. For Chri&s;t &s;hews us, we &s;hould be ready to part with our Lives for his <HI>Sake, and to lay them down for the Brethren,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.16. Therefore all other Intere&s;ts would be transferred to this.</P>
<P N="2">2. See that there be an hearty Union in all Things nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation.</P>
<P>All true Chri&s;tians are agreed in all Things ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation. <HI>One Lord, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Faith, one Bapti&s;m, one God, and Father of all,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.5, 6.

Repentance from dead Works, &s;incere, holy Obedience to the whole revealed Will of God, is nece&s;&s;ary, as the Way to Salvation. That the Ob&s;ervance of all God's po&s;itive In&s;titutions, and the &s;incere Exerci&s;e of univer&s;al Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Love, and Charity, are the genuine and nece&s;&s;ary Fruits of true Faith, and Actings of Holine&s;s.

<P N="3"><PB N="25" REF="006797_0025_1029A3F883286920">
3. There mu&s;t be a Forbearing one another a all Things not e&s;&s;ential to Salvation. As Chri&s;tians mu&s;t be all of one Mind in all Things ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, &s;o in other Matters, there is little Room to ex|pect they &s;hould be of one wind: They never have been in any Age of Chri&s;tianity, nor is it like they ever will be in this World. 'Tis almo&s;t as common to differ in their Thoughts about other Things, as in their Looks. And if you are re&s;olved to maintain Di&s;&s;ention and Con|tention, becau&s;e there are many Things wherein you have different Apprehen&s;ions from others, you may e'en &s;it down in De&s;pair of an Union. If Chri&s;tians are re&s;olved to contend, becau&s;e you don't all think alike about Church Di&s;ci|pline, or the Explication of every particular Text of Scripture, you may give over the Thoughts of Peace and Union, and conclude to tear the &s;eamle&s;s Coat of Chri&s;t to pieces. The Chri&s;tian Church, 'tis like, will never be in Peace in this World, but by a kind and charitable Forbearance of one another in all Things which are not e&s;&s;ential to Salvation. This is the Way of being of one Mind in the&s;e Things; and 'tis like God has left the&s;e Mat|ters liable to Di&s;putes and Debates, among other wi&s;e Rea&s;ons, for this, <HI>viz.</HI> to exerci&s;e the Humility, Forbearance, and Charity, as
