<P>Becau&s;e thy Heart was tender, and thou ha&s;t humbled thy &s;elf before the LORD, when thou hearde&s;t what I &s;pake again&s;t this Place, and again&s;t the Inhabitants thereof, that they &s;hould become a De&s;olation and a Cur&s;e, and ha&s;t rent thy Clothes, and wept before me: I have al&s;o heard thee, &s;aith the LORD.</P>

<P>IN this Chapter we have the Beginning of the Reign of that godly King and eminent Refor|mer, <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> 1 &amp; 2.Ver&s;es. In the eighteenth Year, he gave Order for repairing the Hou&s;e of God; a Care mo&s;t becoming civil Rulers, who derive their Power from the mo&s;t High; that the Wor&s;hip of that GOD by whom Kings reign, may not be neg|lected.

And when the Book of the Law was found, and read before the King, he was deeply affected, "as one a&s;hamed of the Sins of his People, and afraid of God's Wrath."

<P N="1">1. What is implied in this,<HI>Thy Heart was tender</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>An&s;w. Negatively, It is not <HI>that natural Tender|ne&s;s</HI> whereby &s;ome are more flexible and ready to re|ceive Impre&s;&s;ions than others, and which is increas'd by a good Education. Some Per&s;ons by their <HI>Con&s;ti|tution,</HI> are more ea&s;ily wro't upon than others; and it's ob&s;erv'd, that a <HI>good Education</HI> &s;oftens the Man|ners, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Emollit, mores,</NOTE> &s;o that the&s;e are not &s;o rough and untracta|ble as others. And this is lovely. But then, if &s;uch continue de&s;titute of the gracious Tenderne&s;s of which we now &s;peak, and get loo&s;e from the Re&s;traints of Education, they become as Wax, ready to receive hurtful Impre&s;&s;ions from the Men and Things of the World; and &s;oon grow hard and inflexible to the Calls and Warnings of God's Word and Providence.</P>
<P>Nor is it meerly that <HI>legal Terror</HI> by which &s;ome fear and tremble when God threatens to bring de|&s;troying Judgments upon them. As when God threatned <HI>Ahab</HI> by the Prophet <HI>Elijah,</HI> that he would bring Evil upon him, and take away his Po&s;te|rity; <HI>Ahab</HI> rent his Clothes, and went &s;oftly; &s;o that God took Notice of it, and &s;aid to the Prophet, <HI>See&s;t thou how</HI> Ahab <HI>humbleth him&s;elf before me</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kin. 21.</NOTE> And yet, alas! he went on in his wicked Ways, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was hardned to his De&s;truction, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ch. 22.</NOTE> <HI>Felix</HI> trembled,

while <HI>Paul</HI> rea&s;oned of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Temperance, and Judgment to come; but diverted and &s;tifled his Convictions, and then it &s;eems was given up to his Heart Lu&s;ts: For when he had &s;aid, Go thy way for this Time; when I have a more convenient Sea|&s;on, I will call for thee, it follows, He hoped that Money &s;hould have been given him of <HI>Paul,</HI> that he might loo&s;e him.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act. 24.25, 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>Nor is this an Heart <HI>perplexed with needle&s;'s Scru|ples</HI> about indifferent Things; or ca&s;t down with <HI>im|moderate Fear and Di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> even concerning &s;pi|ritual Things. I grant, the&s;e Evils &s;ometimes ea&s;ily be&s;et God's dear Children; but they are their Infirmities, and have a Tendency to en&s;eeble them in the great Work of their Salvation.</P>
<P>But to &s;peak more directly: A tender Heart is an Heart <HI>delivered from the Dominion of Sin,</HI> thro' which Men's Hearts are hardened; &amp; <HI>renewed by the Spirit of Grace,</HI> in it's Qualities and Di&s;po&s;itions, relating to God and &s;piritual Things.</P>
<P>Alas! we are by Nature &s;ince the Fall <HI>dead in Sins,</HI> and &s;o de&s;titute of &s;piritual Sen&s;e and Feeling, till God give us a <HI>new Heart,</HI> and put within us a new Spirit, when we are born from above of the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>More particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. A tender Heart is an Heart <HI>&s;avingly enlightned with the Knowledge of God and his Will.</HI></P>
<P>The Word <HI>Heart,</HI> as u&s;ed in &s;acred Writ, compre|hends all the Faculties and Powers of the Soul. In particular, the <HI>Under&s;tanding.</HI> Prov. 8.5.&mdash; <HI>Ye Fools, be ye of an under&s;tanding Heart.</HI> It is &s;aid of the <HI>Jews,</HI> that there was a Vail on their Hearts; for

their Minds were blinded, or as <HI>Beza</HI> tran&s;tates it, hardned. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 3.14, 15.</NOTE> They had not the Knowledge of Je&s;us as the Son of God, and the true <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and &s;o re|jected him, and his Go&s;pel: Had they known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory. And therefore, when the Spirit of God was pour'd out to make known this great My&s;tery of Godline&s;s. <HI>God manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h,</HI> they look'd to him whom they had pierced, and mourn'd as for an only Son, and a fir&s;t born. When <HI>Peter</HI> preached to them and charged them home with this mo&s;t heinous Crime, they were <HI>pricked in their Heart</HI> with deep Remor&s;e, and obey'd the Call given them to repent. Act 2.37, 8.41. Thus when <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b</HI> was enlightned with clear Manife&s;tations of the glorious. Maje&s;ty of God, he &s;ays,&mdash; <HI>Now mine Eye &s;eeth thee. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> herefore I ab|hor my &s;elf, and repent in Du&s;t and A&s;hes.</HI> Chap. 42.5, 6. And when the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> had &s;een the Lord &s;itting on a Throne high and lifted up, he cried out with deep Aba&s;ement; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is me, for I am un|done, becau&s;e I am a Man of unclean Lips, and I dwell among a People of unclean Lips: for mine Eyes have &s;een the King, the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</HI> Ch. 6.5. A believing Sight of God, &s;oftens the Heart.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the Heart is tender, <HI>the Will is renewed, and moulded into a Conformity to the Will of God.</HI></P>
<P>Such who&s;e Hearts are hardened, have their Wills bent to back&s;lide. Jer. 2.25.&mdash; <HI>I have loved Strangers, and after them will I go.</HI> And our Saviour, who &s;pake as never Man &s;pake, yet had Rea&s;on to com|plain that his Hearers <HI>would not come to him,</HI> that they might have Life. But when the Hearts of Men are &s;oftned by the Grace of God, they are <HI>made will|ing</HI> in die Day of God's Power. Now they no longer

re&s;i&s;t the Spirit of God and the Means he u&s;eth to draw them to him&s;elf. They hear and learn of the Father, and go to Chri&s;t, weary and heavy laden under the Burden of their Sins, and open their Hearts to re|ceive him as offer'd in the Go&s;pel. Now they chu&s;e the Lord as their God, and cleave to him with Pur|po&s;e of Heart, as their chief Good, and highe&s;t End: They are no longer as the Way-&s;ide, or Stony-ground Hearers: No! they receive due Impre&s;&s;ions from God's Word, and it is written on the fle&s;hly Tables of their Hearts, as with the Finger of God: and they are ready to &s;ay, <HI>Lord, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wilt thou have me to do?</HI> And now, they no longer contend with God, when under the <HI>correcting</HI> Hand of his Providence; but re&s;ign to his &s;overeign Will, &s;aying with <HI>Eli,</HI> It is the Lord, <HI>let him do what &s;eemeth him good;</HI> or af|ter their great Ma&s;ter, <HI>Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</HI> Thus when the Heart is tender, the Will is inclin'd to an obedient Subjection to the divine Will.</P>
<P N="3">3. A tender Heart is an Heart <HI>purified from vile Affections, and &s;o &s;et right with God.</HI></P>
<P>We read of <HI>vile Affections,</HI> (Rom. 1.26.) Such are the Pa&s;&s;ions, when inordinately plac'd on this pre&s;ent evil World, and &s;et on gratifying ba&s;e Lu&s;ts. Such are they who are Lovers of Plea&s;ures, more than Lo|vers of God, and who&s;e Hearts are harden'd from God's Fear. Bur now, when the Heart is chane'd by the Spirit of God, his Love is &s;hed Abroad in it, and the Language of the Soul is that, <HI>Whom have I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Heaven but Thee?</HI> and there is none upon Earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ides Thee.

Being warned of God, and believing his Word, relating to the Calamities coming on a &s;inful World, they fly for Refuge unto Chri&s;t, to lay hold on the Hope &s;et be|fore them in Him. And when they hear the Threat|nings denounced again&s;t God's Covenant People, their Hearts tremble for the Ark of God. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 4.13.</NOTE> They Sigh and Cry for all the Abominations done among God's People, and hate the Work of them that turn a&s;ide from God, and the Way of his Commandments. Such was the Heart of this good King; when he heard the Threatinings of God's Word denounced again&s;t <HI>Judah &amp; Jeru&s;alem</HI> for their many and great Iniquities He <HI>rent his Clothes,</HI> expre&s;s'd an holy Dread of God's Wrath, and wept before him: And al&s;o manife&s;ted a great Indignation again&s;t the gro&s;s Idolatries, and other Crimes, whereby his People had enkindled the jealous Anger of God again&s;t them.</P>
<P N="4">4. A tender Heart is <HI>an Heart &s;pirinkled from an evil Con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P>We have this Phra&s;e u&s;ed, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.22. The Con|&s;ciences of &s;uch are purified in Virtue of the Blood of Chri&s;t, which is the Blood of God,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act. 20.28.</NOTE> and &s;o of Vir|tue

But the tender Heart implies a well-enlightned, faithful and tender Con&s;cience, ready to reprove for &s;ecret Sins, and &s;uch as break not forth into overt Acts; yea, to check us for not avoiding the Appearance of Evil. <HI>David</HI>'s Heart &s;mote him for outting off <HI>Saul</HI>'s Skirt, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 24.5.</NOTE> &s;o far was he from &s;tretching forth his Hand again&s;t him, to &s;lay the Lord's Anointed.

<P N="5">5. A tender Heart is a <HI>broken and a contrite Heart.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="007790_0012_102D8B866593A100">We read of God's ancient People, Jer. 5.3. <HI>They have made their Faces harder than a Rock, they have refu&s;ed to return.</HI> But the tender Heart flows down at God's Pre&s;ence, and is di&s;&s;olv'd in penitential Tears.

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>USE I. <HI>See the great Evil and Danger of an hard Heart.</HI></P>
<P>Contraries will have contrary Con&s;equences. This deadly Plague of the Heart inclines Men to di&s;obey and reject the Warnings of God's Word and Provi|dence. And this is highly provoking to God. Heb. 3.8. <HI>Harden not your Hearts, as in the Provocation.</HI> This evil Spirit gives God rea&s;on to complain as of his ancient People, I&s;ai. 1.5. <HI>Why &s;hould ye be &s;tricken any more? ye will revolt more and more.</HI> And therefore, when God's profe&s;&s;ing People are guilty of this great and Heaven-daring Sin under in|flicted and threatned Judgments, it's a fearful Pre|&s;age of approaching Ruin. Ver. 7. <HI>Your Country is de&s;olate, your Cities are burnt with Fire: your Land, Strangers devour it in your Pre&s;ence, and it is de&s;olate as overthrown by Strangers.</HI> Accordingly Wi&s;dom cries, Prov. 1.23. <HI>Turn you at my Reproof.</HI> And threatens, v. 24,&mdash;27. <HI>Becau&s;e I have called,
<PB N="17" REF="007790_0019_102D8B94D0E06388">
and ye refu&s;ed. I have &s;tretched out my Hand, and no Man regarded; But ye have &s;et at nought all my Coun&s;el, &amp; would none of my Reproof: I will al&s;o laugh at your Calamity, and mock when your Fear cometh; When your Fear cometh as De&s;ola|tion, and your De&s;truction cometh as a Whirlwind.</HI> O let us then be deeply humbled for the prevailing Power of this great Evil among us, in this dark and cloudy Day, and Cry to God to take away the <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ny Heart</HI> out of our Fle&s;h, le&s;t we &s;hould be left after our Hardne&s;s, and impenitent Heart, to trea|&s;ure up Wrath again&s;t the Day of Wrath, and Reve|lation of the righteous Judgmeat of God.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let us all be exhorted, <HI>in the diligent u&s;e of Means, to &s;eek of God this tender Heart.</HI></P>
<P>It is God's Gift. Ezek. 36.26.&mdash;<HI>I will give you an Heart of Fle&s;h.</HI> i.e. a tender and &s;oft Heart, of quick Sen&s;e, and ready to receive due Impre&s;&s;ions from God's Word and Providence, and to yield to his &s;overeign Will. Let us then <HI>pray</HI> to God for this great Ble&s;&s;ing. When God had promi&s;ed it, He adds, Ezek. 36.37. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord God, I will yet for this be inquired of by the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, to do, it for them.</HI> God will do this; but it mu&s;t be in An&s;wer to Prayer. He expects that his People do thus &s;hew their Value for &s;o great a Mercy, and their entire Dependance on him for it. Let us then, deeply &s;en&s;ible how our Hearts have been de|filed and hardened by Sin, pour out that Prayer to the God of all Grace, P&s;al. 51.10. <HI>Create in me a clean Heart, O God; and renew a right Spirit within me.</HI> Again, we mu&s;t <HI>attend to the Word of God,</HI> which is perfect, converting the Soul. Jer. 23.29. <HI>Is not my Word like a Fire? &s;aith the Lord: and like a Hammer that breaketh the Rock in Pieces.</HI> Yes
<PB N="18" REF="007790_0020_102D8B96DB7A9F48">
&s;urely, when the Almighty is pleas'd to take it into his Hand, he can break the harde&s;t Heart, and di&s;|&s;olve it into Tears of godly Sorrow, which worketh Repentance to Salvation. Let us then wait at the Po&s;ts of Wi&s;dom's Doors, and hearken to the Voice of God's Word, and pray that we may mix it with Faith; then the Word will be to us the Power of God to change and &s;often our Hearts. Again, we &s;hould <HI>ob&s;erve the Providences of God</HI> for this End: That his Goodne&s;s may lead us to Repentance; and that under his awful Judgments, we may &s;ay with <HI>Joh,</HI> Chap. 23.16.&mdash; <HI>God maketh my Heart &s;oft.</HI> And that knowing the Terrors of the Lord, we may look unto Je&s;us, to whom the Father hath committed all Judgment, and mourn and turn to the Lord, with a broken Heart and contrite Spirit.</P>
<P N="3">III. Then we &s;hould lay <HI>it to Heart, when Per|&s;ons of this Character are taken from us by Death.</HI></P>
<P>Let them be high or low in their outward Cir|cum&s;tances, they are the excellent in the Earth, the <HI>Chariots and Hor&s;emen of I&s;rael,</HI> who help to keep off Judgments from a People. Had there been ten &s;uch righteous Per&s;ons in <HI>Sodom,</HI> the God who cannot lie, gave his Word to <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen 19.32.&mdash; <HI>I will not de&s;troy it for tens &s;ake.</HI> Agreeably, God &s;peaks of it as a provoking Sin, I&s;ai. 57.1. <HI>The Righteous peri&s;heth, and no Man layeth it to Heart.</HI> And then adds, <HI>None con&s;idering that the Righteous are taken away from the Evil to come.</HI> May God avert the Omen!</P>
<P>In a particular Manner is this the Ca&s;e, when &s;uch are removed by Death, as were of <HI>publick Character and Influence,</HI> and in their Stations <HI>Gap|men,</HI> who us'd their be&s;t Endeavours, Humane Frail|ties
<PB N="19" REF="007790_0021_102D8B991EB2B808">
excepted, to keep off impending Judgments from breaking in upon their People.</P>
<P>One of this Character, was that <HI>Honourable Per|&s;on,</HI> who&s;e Death we lament before the Lord this Day: Who <HI>having &s;erved his Generation by the Will of God, is fallen a&s;leep, and laid unto his Fathers.</HI> As he bare the Name, &s;o he exhibited much of the Spirit of this pious King: His Heart was tender, humbled and &s;oftned under God's cor|recting Hand, in public and dome&s;tic Calamities. He was a true Mourner in Zion, for his own, and the Sins of God's People; and forward to engage in the Work of Repentance and Reformation, that God's Anger might be turned away.</P>
<P>In his Death this <HI>Province is bereav'd</HI> of One who was a faithful Friend and tender Father to his Country, in the &s;everal Places of public Tru&s;t which he filled: As a <HI>Secretary</HI> of this Province by the Royal Commi&s;&s;ion, for about forty Years, in which Office he continued till his Death; and as he had been for &s;everal Years of the Honourable Council, and Judge of Probate for this County: He di&s;charged the Duties of the&s;e important Offices with a laudable Capacity, great Diligence and Inte|grity, as a good and faithful Servant of God, his King and Country. His &s;olicitous Care was, that the Common-Wealth might receive no Damage. And he was moderate in his Demands from particu|lar Per&s;ons; &s;o far from extorting more than was due, that, as I am informed, he rather abated of his Right. And there is Rea&s;on now to take up that Lamentation, and &s;ay, <HI>Behold, the Lord, the Lord of Ho&s;ts doth take away the Judge, and the prudent, and the Ancient, the honourable Man, and the Councellor.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="007790_0022_102D8B9B598B71A8">In his Death, the <HI>College,</HI> whom he &s;erv'd as a Tutor for &s;everal Years, is <HI>bereav'd</HI> of a <HI>vigilant Oxer&s;eer,</HI> who&s;e great Concern was that pure Reli|gion and the be&s;t humane Literature, might flouri&s;h in that <HI>School of the Prophets,</HI> which may God pre&s;erve for a great Ble&s;&s;ing to our Land, &s;o long as the Sun and Moon &s;hall endure.</P>

<P>I can't tell how to think, that <HI>all</HI> the Congrega|tion, excepting <HI>Mo&s;es, Aaron, Jo&s;hua</HI> and <HI>Caleb,</HI> were combin'd in the <HI>Mutiny:</HI> For it appears clear to me, that <HI>the whole Tribe</HI> of <HI>Levi,</HI> were di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the Re&s;t in <HI>Mutiny;</HI> as a late learned Writer of our own, a curious Searcher of the holy Scriptures,<NOTE N="&amp;dagger;" PLACE="foot">The late Hon.

<P>Nor can I think that <HI>all</HI> the MEN of <HI>this Congregation,</HI> excepting <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;titute of real <HI>habitual Holine&s;s;</HI> or what is com|monly called &s;pecial &s;anctifying, &s;aving Grace.

<P>Yea, I am apt to think that <HI>great Numbers</HI> even of the <HI>Murmurers them&s;elves,</HI> might yet have <HI>Principles</HI> of <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> or Grace <HI>in the Bottom of their Hearts;</HI> tho' then dreadfully overwhelmed with &s;ud|den Floods of Pa&s;&s;ion and Corruption:&mdash;as in the Bot|tom of the Heart of <HI>Peter,</HI> when he profanely curs'd and &s;wore, and deny'd his Divine and dear Ma&s;ter. And if CHRIST had not &s;o &s;oon be&s;towed &s;uch a melting Look upon Him, he would not have &s;o &s;oon gone out and wept &s;o bitterly.</P>
<P>It is both grievous and a&s;toni&s;hing to think how the habitual and <HI>vital Principles</HI> of Grace, may lie deep in the Hearts of the Renewed, or tho&s;e who are be|gun to be &s;anctified; and yet &s;ometimes by the awful <HI>Permi&s;&s;ion</HI> of GOD, be overwhelmed by <HI>Temptati|ons</HI> and <HI>Corruptions,</HI> which over-power and for a while &s;uppre&s;s the predominant Exerci&s;e of tho&s;e vi|tal Principles; and the <HI>Renewed</HI> are &s;adly left to act and look like the <HI>Re&s;t</HI> of the <HI>ungodly</HI> and <HI>wicked</HI>

World. And this I apprehend was the Ca&s;e of <HI>many</HI> blended with that tumultuous Multitude.</P>
<P>But CALEB had in Him&s;elf, and on that Occa&s;&s;ion &s;hewed quite <HI>another Spirit:</HI> i. e. a Spirit, not only totally different from tho&s;e who were habitually <HI>Wicked</HI> and <HI>Ungodly</HI> but al&s;o va&s;tly different from tho&s;e who were <HI>Religious at the Bottom,</HI> but in that Sea&s;on of Temptation murmured with the Re&s;t of the Congregation.</P>

<P>To this I an&s;wer&mdash;</P>
<P>The <HI>active Temper</HI> of his Heart or Soul, were not only <HI>&s;anctified</HI> with holy Reli&s;hes and Bents, where|by he differ'd from all the <HI>Ungodly;</HI> But this &s;ancti|fied Temper al&s;o <HI>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e</HI> and <HI>acted</HI> in a <HI>predominant</HI> and <HI>eminent Degree,</HI> whereby he likewi&s;e differed from the Re&s;t of the Religious among the murmur|ing Multitude.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;everal Branches</HI> of this &s;anctified Temper are in the holy Scripture commonly called <HI>Graces,</HI> And all the&s;e Graces dwelt and acted in him in a lively, reigning, apparent and &s;teady Manner. Thus we read of <HI>the Spirit of Wi&s;dom,</HI> which his Compa|nion Jo&s;hua was &s;aid to be <HI>full of,</HI> Deut. xxxiv. 9. <HI>The Spirit of Meekne&s;s,</HI> which the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed the <HI>Chri&s;tian Galatians</HI> had; <HI>Chap.</HI> vi 1.

<P>He di&s;tingui&s;hingly &s;how'd, that he had not only <HI>That Faith</HI> in GOD and in <HI>his In&s;pirations</HI> which he derived from <HI>Education &amp; Rational Conviction;</HI> but al&s;o <HI>That</HI> va&s;tly more vital, active and victorious <HI>Faith</HI> wrought by the DIVINE SPIRIT, when he changes or begins to &s;anctify the Hearts of Sinners.

<P>And as GOD had <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> to bring the Nation of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and put them in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Canaan;</HI> and CALEB knew this Promi&s;e, and had &s;een the Begining of its Fulfilment in a mo&s;t won|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Manner in <HI>Egypt,</HI> in the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> and in the <HI>Wilderne&s;s</HI> hitherto; He had a believing &amp; certain View of his Fulfilling all the Remainder, over every Ob&s;tacle and Oppo&s;ition.

<P>There &s;eem'd to be a great deal of <HI>Sincerity, Opene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Freene&s;s</HI> in his <HI>natural Temper;</HI> tho' his <HI>Opene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Freene&s;s</HI> were agreably tempered with <HI>Innocence</HI> and <HI>Prudence.</HI> And when he couragiou&s;ly open'd him|&s;elf with any Mea&s;ure of <HI>Anger;</HI> it proceeded from Di&s;plea&s;ure at the <HI>Evil,</HI> and not Enmity to the <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> and from a <HI>Con&s;ciencious Zeal</HI> for the <HI>Glory</HI> of GOD, and <HI>Good</HI> of <HI>Men.</HI> But his <HI>Sincerity,</HI> by the <HI>humbling and breaking</HI> Influences of the SPIRIT of GOD on his enlightned Heart, became in an emi|nent Degree a <HI>Grace</HI> of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>His more <HI>eminent Piety</HI> began with <HI>this humbling and breaking</HI> Operation. He had &s;uch <HI>lively Views</HI> given Him of the <HI>Glorious Holine&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> of GOD, the <HI>Exten&s;ivene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Strictne&s;s</HI> of his <HI>holy Law; his own Vilene&s;s,</HI> the horrible Corruptions in him, his utter Inability to &s;uppre&s;s them, the horrid Aver&s;ene&s;s of hi Heart to holy Meditations on GOD and CHRIST, his utter Inability &s;o to change his

Heart as to think upon them with Delight, together with tho&s;e ba&s;e and carnal Motives which put him on and mixed with, and &s;o defiled all his Duties; with the perfectly and perpetually holy and all-&s;eeing Eye of GOD upon him;&mdash;that his Heart was broken to Pieces with the deepe&s;t Shame, Aba&s;ement, and Self-Abhorrence: All his Confidence in his own Strength and Righteou&s;ne&s;s or Worthine&s;s, was utterly de&s;troy|ed: He could &s;ay with the inlightened <HI>Joh</HI> in Chap. xl. 3&mdash;5. <HI>Then Joh an&s;wered the LORD and &s;aid, Behold I am vile; what &s;hall I an&s;wer Thee? I will lay my Hand upon my Mouth: once have I &s;poken, but I will not An&s;wer; yea twice, but I will proceed no further.</HI> And in Chap. xlii. 1. <HI>Then</HI> JOB <HI>an&s;wered the LORD and &s;aid, I know that thou can&s;t do every Thing, and that no Thought can be with-holden from Thee: I have heard of Thee by the heard of the Ear; but now mine Eye &s;eeth Thee: Wherefore I abhor my &s;elf, and repent in Du&s;t and A&s;hes.</HI> And from this Time, deep Hu|mility, Lowline&s;s and Brokenne&s;s of Heart, with a thoro' gracious, eminent Sincerity, became more appa|rently the habitual, reigning Principles or Di&s;po&s;itions in Him.</P>
<P>Now he al&s;o more clearly &s;aw the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of the Divine SPIRIT to &s;anctify, enlighten, help and govern him; of the perfect and mo&s;t meritorious Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST to ju&s;tify him; and of the in|finite Grace of GOD to abound thro' CHRIST and by the HOLY SPIRIT, infinitely to him. CHRIST as GOD and Man Mediator appeared in his perfect Excellency, All-&s;ufficiency, and Suitablene&s;s, to &s;ave and make him happy: And to the glorious GOD in CHRIST he looked, and on Him tru&s;ted, and this continually, to &s;ave him from his Sins, his Sinfulne&s;s and Mi&s;eries; and by his Holy SPIRIT to give

him &s;aving Light &amp; Grace; &s;piritual Wi&s;dom, Strength, Victories and Comforts; and prepare him for, &amp; bring Him for the heavenly Glory.</P>
<P>He was a diligent Searcher of the <HI>Holy Scriptures;</HI> had a deep Impre&s;&s;ion on his Heart of their Divine In&s;piration and Authority; even by his own continual Experience, whereby his Faith in them was abun|dantly confirmed: He clearly &s;aw their exceeding Preciou&s;ne&s;s: and the Truths and Promi&s;es therein were his delightful Contemplation.</P>
<P>He was well acquainted with the Meaning of tho&s;e Divine Truths revealed in the Scriptures, which are <HI>compatible</HI> to the humane Under&s;tanding: And for tho&s;e <HI>above</HI> it; He reverentially &s;ubmitted to the Di|vine Authority, &amp; as firmly believed them, becau&s;e de|clar'd by GOD, as any Others.</P>
<P>He believed <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of the <HI>Churches</HI> commonly called <HI>Reformed</HI> to be wonderfully agreea|ble to the HOLY SCRIPTURES. For he could not but account it a wondrous Thing indeed, that tho' they differed about the <HI>Wor&s;hip, Form</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>Churches;</HI> yet all the Martyrs and Reformers in <HI>England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Italy, Swit|zerland,</HI> the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> as &s;oon as they had the SCRIPTURES tran&s;lated into their &s;everal Languages, without con&s;ulting with each other; yet harmoniou&s;ly agreed in the very <HI>&s;ame Doctrines,</HI> by which they liv'd and dy'd, on which their extraordi|nary Piety was founded, and which great Numbers &s;ealed in the glowing Fire: which the mo&s;t pious <HI>Founders</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI> brought over hither, and to which the pious Mini&s;ters and People of <HI>our Chur|ches</HI> have &s;tedfa&s;tly adhered to the pre&s;ent Day.</P>
<P>In Particular, He firmly believed with them, that the un&s;earchable <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Divine Trinity,</HI> is mo&s;t plainly revealed in SCRIPTURE; and &s;o inter|woven
<PB N="24" REF="007790_0049_102F6B9F9A73DDA8">
with the entire Frame of the Chri&s;tian Revela|tion and Religion, that if this Divine Doctrine be taken away, the wondrous Fabrick of Chri&s;tianity would fall to Pieces, and the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion intro|duced in the Minds of its Profe&s;&s;ors. And he was &s;o much grieved, that he could fearce enjoy any Re&s;t, at the pernicious Attempts of &s;ome among us to un|dermine this great and fundamental Doctrine.</P>
<P>He would never perplex his Mind with <HI>Metaphy|&s;ical</HI> or &s;ubtil Attempts to <HI>explain</HI> it; which he ap|prehended a vain Intru&s;ion into Things above our Reach, and not revealed. He clearly &s;aw the in&s;pi|red Oracles a&s;cribe the <HI>&s;ame Divine Perfections, Titles, Works,</HI> and <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> to the <HI>Divine</HI> FATHER, WORD and SPIRIT, which belong only to the <HI>One</HI> true GOD: That they <HI>ab&s;olutely forbid devine Wor&s;hip</HI> to be paid <HI>to any other;</HI> that the FATHER is the One GOD, the WORD is the One GOD, and the SPIRIT is the One GOD; but that there is <HI>&s;ame Sort of Di&s;tinction</HI> which the <HI>Scripture</HI> represents under the Form of a Per&s;onal <HI>Di&s;tinction;</HI> &s;o that it would be highly improper to &s;ay that either the <HI>Divine</HI> FATHER, or the <HI>Divine</HI> SPIRIT were <HI>made Fle&s;h</HI> or <HI>became Incarnate;</HI> and yet that <HI>The&s;e Three</HI> are wondrou&s;ly <HI>united;</HI> but what that <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> is <HI>preci&s;ely,</HI> is not yet revealed, and without a further Revelation we can never find it.</P>
<P>With the concurring Help of the <HI>Divine</HI> SPIRIT, He felt the quickning and &s;anctifying Power, and reli&s;hed the Sweetne&s;s of the DOCTRINES <HI>of the Go&s;pel</HI> preached in our NEW-ENGLAND <HI>Churches,</HI> which he found to be the very &s;ame which were com|monly taught in the <HI>Church</HI> of ENGLAND in the Reigns of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> King <HI>James</HI> I, and King <HI>Charles</HI> I And as he advanced in <HI>Sanctity,</HI> the more the <HI>Go&s;pel Doctrines</HI> and <HI>pious Spirit</HI> of <HI>tho&s;e ancient

Writers</HI> became ageeable to him. He had a mighty and ju&s;t Sen&s;e of <HI>Eternity,</HI> and of <HI>his eternal Inte|re&s;t;</HI> wi&s;ely apprehended all others were Trifles in Companion, and that he could not be too much con|cerned or careful to &s;ecure it:&mdash;was therefore greatly afraid lea&s;t he &s;hould be fatally mi&s;taken in a Matter of &s;uch infinite Importance:&mdash;mo&s;t diligently there|fore &s;earched his own Heart&mdash;chiefly valued the <HI>mo&s;t &s;earching Mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Writers;</HI> tho&s;e who mo&s;tly treat of <HI>the Religion of the Heart;</HI> i. e. the Work of the HOLY SPIRIT on the Hearts of Men, with the inward Workings of <HI>their own Spirits,</HI> and the Fruit of both; or which is the &s;ame, of <HI>vital</HI> or <HI>experimental Piety!</HI></P>
<P>And tho' he &s;ometimes walked in <HI>Darkne&s;s;</HI> yet he has told me, He dare not deny the gracious Influ|ence of the HOLY SPIRIT in him; the hopeful Appearances of a &s;aving Change; of the Exerci&s;e of internal Graces;&mdash;in Particular high and endearing Apprehensions of GOD, as he appears in CHRIST; earne&s;t Thir&s;tings after Him, delightful Views of Him, and therein &s;en&s;ible Communion with Him, But his own Deficiencies in Obedience and Holine&s;s, with the &s;inful Workings in him, and the Body of Sin, were his continual Burden: And of the&s;e, with his Imper|fections and the Dulne&s;s in the Frames and Motions of his Heart towards the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, as di&s;playing him&s;elf in CHRIST, he was continually complaining, and even groaning to be delivered from them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> he &s;aw plainly de&s;cribed in Scripture, mo&s;t clearly evident in the univer&s;al Depravation of Mankind, mo&s;t bitterly com|plained of by all the Pious he conver&s;ed with: And he knew it to be true from his own <HI>continual Expe|rience.</HI> Yea the more he grew in Sanctity, the more he &s;aw with Grief the odious Fountain in him. For

the &s;tronger he grew in his A&s;pirations after perfect Holine&s;s; every Inclination, every Frame, and every Tho't of a &s;inful Nature, grew more grievous to him; and &s;o did every Indi&s;po&s;ition to think on GOD, on CHRIST, on <HI>Heaven,</HI> on the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, with Engagedne&s;s and Plea&s;ure. When he could not Sleep in the <HI>Night;</HI> O how ardent were his Thir&s;tings after GOD, as in a dry and parched Land, where is no Water! How earne&s;t his De&s;ires of having his Heart and Meditation fixed on tho&s;e Divine and holy Ob|jects with &s;upream Delight! How grievous to feel the mi&s;erable Indi&s;po&s;edne&s;s of his Heart often Times thereto: And the more he felt and &s;aw of the wretch|ed Depravation and Corruption of his Nature.</P>
<P>And indeed, for <HI>above</HI> the&s;e <HI>fifty Years,</HI> I have con&s;tantly ob&s;erved, that the more any Per&s;ons have grown in Piety; the more &s;trong were their De&s;ires after perfect Holine&s;s, the more &s;en&s;ible they grew of the Corruption of their Nature, the more burden|&s;ome it grew, and they more heavily complained with the holy Apo&s;tle PAUL in <HI>Rom.</HI> vii. 22&mdash;24. <HI>I find then a Law, that when I would do Good, Evil is pre&s;ent with me: For I delight in the Law of the GOD after the inward Man: But I &s;ee another Law in my Members warring again&s;t the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of Sin which is in my Members: O wretched Man that I am! Who &s;hall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</HI></P>
<P>Thus have I often heard this pious Per&s;on com|plaining with great Affiction: as al&s;o often repeating the greater Part of the xlii, xliii, &amp; lxiii <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> with the like ardent Thir&s;tings of Soul, as <HI>David</HI> expre&s;&s;ed in his Day. And when he came into his <HI>Final Ill|ne&s;s,</HI> which held about a <HI>Fortnight,</HI> the &s;ame grievous Complaints, ardent Longings, and earne&s;t Prayers,

continued <HI>Day</HI> and <HI>Night</HI> without Ce&s;&s;ation in Him. Yea, they were <HI>&s;o deeply fixed in his Heart;</HI> as that when the Power of Rea&s;on grew quite broken, yet he con&s;tantly repeated, tho' without Connection, <HI>the &s;ame &s;en&s;ible Petitions</HI> both for <HI>Him&s;elf</HI> and <HI>Others,</HI> and with like <HI>Earne&s;tne&s;s</HI> of Soul as u&s;ual, both <HI>Day</HI> and <HI>Night,</HI> till he could &s;peak no more.</P>
<P>Tho' by his tall and erect Stature till Age began to bow him, the maje&s;tick Appearance of his Count|nance, the native and improved Grandeur of his Mind, va&s;tly rais'd above mean and little Things, with his Powers, Accompli&s;hments and exalted Station; He &s;eem'd to be formed to &s;pread a Reverence in all about him; yet the Genero&s;ity and Goodne&s;s of his natural Tmper, and e&s;pecially &s;anctified by the Grace of GOD, made him <HI>exceeding courteous</HI> and <HI>conde|&s;eending</HI> to the meane&s;t Per&s;on: And when he &s;mil'd upon them, it was with the mo&s;t engaging Sweetne&s;s, and Air of cordial Amity.</P>
<P>In <HI>his Hou&s;e</HI> he walked uprightly and with a per|fect Heart, catechizing, in&s;tructing, coun&s;elling, pray|ing, reading in his Family; and recommending all his Coun&s;els and In&s;tructions with his amiable Example&mdash;a &s;trict Ob&s;erver of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Sabbath</HI>&mdash;a reve|rent Attender on the <HI>Public Wor&s;hip,</HI> both in and out of the Sea&s;ons of &s;tated Appointment&mdash;continu|ally appeared at our <HI>Lectures,</HI> as well as our <HI>Lord's-Day</HI> Wor&s;hip, as our Eyes have long &s;een with Plea|&s;ure; tho' now with Sorrow &s;hall &s;ee no more.</P>
<P>His <HI>Heart</HI> was not only exceeding <HI>tender</HI> and <HI>humble,</HI> like JOSIAH'S; but ai&s;o <HI>exceeding large, li|beral, beneficent</HI> and <HI>bountiful</HI> both to the Needy and Afflicted, both in Body and Soul: And he had a great and exten&s;ive View and Concern for the <HI>Good</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> the <HI>Town,</HI> the <HI>College,</HI> the <HI>Land,</HI> the <HI>Nation,</HI> and all the <HI>World.</HI></P>
