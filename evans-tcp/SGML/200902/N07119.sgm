<HEAD>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE Slave-Trade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is a Truth, as &s;orrowful as obvious, that Mankind too generally are actuated by fal&s;e Motives, and &s;ub&s;titute an imaginary Intere&s;t in the Room of that which is real and per|manent: And it mu&s;t be acknowledged by every Man, who is &s;incerely de&s;irous of becoming ac|quainted with him&s;elf, and impartially in&s;pects his own Heart, that Weakne&s;s and inbred Cor|ruption attends human Nature; which cannot be re&s;tored to its original Purity, but through the Efficacy of the Blood of JESUS CHRIST, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. So that notwith&s;tanding the imagined moral Rectitude pleaded for, and the boa&s;ted Pretences of the pre&s;ent Age to refined Conceptions of Things beyond our Forefathers, all this Divine Help is embraced, the bent of the Heart of Man will remain corrupt, and its Power of di&s;tingui&s;hing between Good and Evil liable to be ob&s;cured by Prejudice, Pa&s;&s;ion and
<PB N="4" REF="009066_0003_1031182859DD7D90">Intere&s;t. Covetou&s;ne&s;s and Pride have intro|duced many iniquitous Practices into Civil Socie|ty, &s;ome of which being e&s;tabli&s;hed by Cu&s;tom, and adapted to flatter our Favourite Pa&s;&s;ions, tho' odious in them&s;elves, and mo&s;t pernicious in their Con&s;equences, yet, through the Influence of Ex|ample and U&s;e, become familiar to us, and our depraved Rea&s;on has Recour&s;e to plau&s;ible Ex|cu&s;es, to cover and palliate the mo&s;t atrocious Crimes; &s;o that by Degrees we &s;ilence the Dic|tates of Con&s;cience, and reconcile our&s;elves in the Perpetration of &s;uch Things which, when fir&s;t propo&s;ed to our unprejudiced Minds, would &s;trike us with Amazement and Horror.</P>
<P>A lamentable and &s;hocking In&s;tance of the Influence which the Love of Gain has upon the Minds of tho&s;e who yield to its Allurements, even when contrary to the Dictates of Rea&s;on, and the common Feelings of Humanity, appears in the Pro&s;ecution of the <HI>Negroe Trade,</HI> in which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation has long been deeply con|cerned, and &s;ome in this Province have al&s;o lately engaged. An Evil of &s;o deep a Dye, and attended with &s;uch dreadful Con&s;equences to all that are concerned in it, that no well-di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;on, anxious for the Welfare of him&s;elf, his Country, or Po&s;terity, who knows the Tyranny, Oppre&s;&s;ion and Cruelty with which this iniquitous Trade is carried on, can be a &s;ilent and inno|cent Spectator. How many Thou&s;ands of our harmle&s;s Fellow Creatures have, for a long Cour&s;e of Years, fallen a Sacrifice to that &s;elfi&s;h Avarice, which gives Life to this complicated Wickedne&s;s.
<PB N="5" REF="009066_0004_10311829E14C1028">The Iniquity of being &s;o deeply engaged in a Trade, by which &s;o great a Number of innocent People are yearly de&s;troyed, in &s;o untimely and mi&s;erable a Manner, is greatly aggravated from the Con&s;ideration that we, as a Nation, have been peculiarly favoured with the bright Beams of the Go&s;pel; that Revelation of Divine Love, which the Angels introduced to the World, by a Declaration of Peace on Earth, and Good Will to Men&mdash;of every Nation, Kindred, Tongue and People. How mi&s;erable then mu&s;t be our Condition, if, for filthy Lucre, we &s;hould con|tinue to act &s;o contrary to the Nature of this Divine Call, the Purpo&s;e of which is to introduce an univer&s;al and affectionate Brotherhood in the whole human Species; by removing from the Heart of every Individual, who &s;ubmits to its Operation, the Darkne&s;s and Corruption of Na|ture, and transforming the &s;elfi&s;h, wrathful, proud Spirit, into Meekne&s;s, Purity and Love: For this End the Son of GOD became Man, &s;uffered, and died; and the whole Tenor of the Go&s;pel declares, that for tho&s;e who refu&s;e, or neglect, the Offers of this great Salvation, the Son of GOD has &s;uffered in vain.</P>
<P>The End propo&s;ed by this E&s;&s;ay, is to lay be|fore the candid Reader the Depth of Evil which attends this iniquitous Practice, in the Pro&s;ecution of which, our Duty to GOD, the common Fa|ther of the Family of the whole Earth, and our Duty of Love to our Fellow Creatures, is totally di&s;regarded; all &s;ocial Connection and tender Ties of Nature being broken, and De&s;olation
<PB N="6" REF="009066_0005_1031182B6BE653B8">and Blood&s;hed continually fomented in tho&s;e un|happy People's Country. It is al&s;o intended to invalidate &s;ome fal&s;e Arguments, which are fre|quently advanced, for the Palliation thereof, in Hopes it may be &s;ome Inducement to tho&s;e who are not defiled with this Trade, to keep them|&s;elves clear; and to lay before &s;uch as have unwarily engaged in it, the Danger they are in of totally lo&s;ing that tender Sen&s;ibility to the Suf|ferings of their Fellow Creatures, the Want whereof &s;ets Men beneath the Brute Creation, which mu&s;t unavoidably be the State of every one that continues to partake of the Profits ari&s;ing from this wicked Traffick: A Trade by which &s;o many Thou&s;ands of innocent People are brought under the greate&s;t Anxiety and Suffering, being violently rent from their Native Country, in the mo&s;t cruel Manner, and brought to our Colonies, to be employed in hard Labour, either in Northern Climates, un&s;uited to their Nature, or in a State of the mo&s;t tyrannick and barbarous Slavery, &s;ubject to the Humours and inhuman La&s;h of &s;ome of the mo&s;t hard hearted and incon&s;iderate of Mankind, without any Hopes of ever returning to their Native Land, or &s;eeing an End to their Mi&s;ery: Nor mu&s;t we omit, in this di&s;mal Account, the Weight of Blood which lies on the Promoters of this Trade, from the great Numbers that are yearly butchered in the Incur&s;ions and Battles which happen between the <HI>Negroes,</HI> in order to procure the Number deli|vered to the <HI>Europeans;</HI> and the many of the&s;e poor Creatures who&s;e Hearts are broken, and
<PB N="7" REF="009066_0006_10311830CB1B9508">who peri&s;h, through Mi&s;ery and Grief, on the Pa&s;&s;age. Heaven pre&s;erve the Inhabitants of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> from being further defiled by a Trade, which is entered upon from &s;uch &s;en&s;ual Motives, and carried on by &s;uch devili&s;h Means. And although the&s;e Scenes of Horror are acted in Places far remote, and out of the Sight of tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t enriched thereby; who&s;e Sen&s;es being u&s;ually exerci&s;ed only by pre&s;ent Objects, are little affected with the di&s;tant Suffer|ings of their Fellow Creatures; yet every Mind, which is not &s;o hardened with the Love of Wealth as to be void of feeling, mu&s;t, upon &s;erious Con&s;ideration of this inhuman Practice, be impre&s;&s;ed with Surprize and Terror, from a Sen&s;e that there is a righteous GOD, and a State of Retribution, which mu&s;t la&s;t for ever. It is frequently alledged, in Excu&s;e for this Trade, that the <HI>Negroes</HI> &s;old in our Plantations, are mo&s;tly Per&s;ons who have been taken Pri&s;oners in tho&s;e Wars which ari&s;e among&s;t them&s;elves, from their mutual Animo&s;ities; and that the&s;e Pri&s;oners would be &s;acrificed, to the Re&s;entment of tho&s;e who have taken them Captives. If they were not purcha&s;ed and brought away by the <HI>Europeans.</HI> It is al&s;o repre&s;ented, that the <HI>Ne|groes</HI> are generally a &s;tupid &s;avage People, who&s;e Situation in their own Country is nece&s;&s;itous and unhappy, which has induced many to believe, that the bringing the <HI>Africans</HI> from their Native Land is to them rather a Kindne&s;s than an Injury.</P>
<P>To confute the&s;e fal&s;e Repre&s;entations, the following Extracts are propo&s;ed to the candid
<PB N="8" REF="009066_0007_103118325697EB98">Reader's Con&s;ideration; they are taken from the Writings of the principal Officers, not only in the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but al&s;o in the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Factories or Settlements in <HI>Guiney,</HI> &s;ome of whom have lived many Years in tho&s;e Countries, and have been Eye Witne&s;&s;es to tho&s;e Tran&s;ac|tions, and who&s;e Station in the Factories will not admit of any Doubt of the Truth of what they relate; by which it will appear, that the <HI>Negroes</HI> are generally &s;en&s;ible, humane and &s;ociable, and that their Capacity is as good, and as capable of Improvement, as that of the White People: That their Country, though unfriendly to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> yet appears peculiarly agreeable, and well adapted to the Nature of the <HI>Blacks,</HI> and &s;o fruitful, as to furni&s;h its Inhabitants plentifully with the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, with much le&s;s La|bour than is nece&s;&s;ary in our more Northern Countries. And as to the common Argument, alledged in Defence of the Trade, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Slaves &s;old to the <HI>Europeans</HI> are Captives ta|ken in War, who would be de&s;troyed by their Conquerors, if not thus purcha&s;ed, it is without Foundation, it being made clearly to appear, from the forementioned Te&s;timonies, that the Wars and Incur&s;ions made by the <HI>Negroes,</HI> one upon another, are mo&s;tly at the Solicitation of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> who in&s;tigate them by every Me|thod, even the mo&s;t iniquitous and cruel, to pro|cure Slaves to load their Ve&s;&s;els, which they freely purcha&s;e, without any Regard to the Pre|cepts of the Go&s;pel, the feelings of Humanity, or the common Dictates of Rea&s;on and Equity.
<PB N="9" REF="009066_0008_10311833ED184020">For though it is &s;care to be doubted, but that there were Wars among&s;t &s;ome of the <HI>Negroes,</HI> before the <HI>Europeans</HI> began to trade with them, yet certain it is, that the&s;e Calamities are not only &s;ince that Time prodigiou&s;ly encrea&s;ed, and the <HI>Europeans,</HI> by encouraging them thereto, and gladly purcha&s;ing the Captives they take, are be|come come not only Parties with them therein, but the &s;ole Cau&s;e of that Encrea&s;e. This is plainly in|ferred from the Account given by <HI>N. Brue,</HI> Director of the <HI>French</HI> Factory at <HI>Senegal,</HI> who lived Twenty-&s;even Years in that Country, who &s;ays, <Q>That the <HI>Europeans</HI> are far from de&s;iring to act as Peace Makers among&s;t the <HI>Negroes,</HI> which would be acting contrary to their In|tere&s;t, &s;ince the greater the Wars, the more Slaves are procured.</Q></P>
<P><HI>William Bo&s;man,</HI> Factor for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> at <HI>Delmina,</HI> where he re&s;ided &s;ixteen Years, relates, <Q>That one of the former Commanders hired an Army of the <HI>Negroes,</HI> of <HI>Jafferia</HI> and <HI>Cabe|&s;teria,</HI> for a large Sum of Money, to fight the <HI>Negroes</HI> of <HI>Commany,</HI> which occa&s;ioned a Bat|tle, which was more bloody than the Wars of the <HI>Negroes</HI> u&s;ually are: And that another Commander gave, at one time, <HI>Five Hundrea Pounds,</HI> and at another time <HI>Eight Hundred Pounds,</HI> to two other <HI>Negroe</HI> Nations, to in|duce them to take up Arms again&s;t their Coun|try People.</Q> This is confirmed by <HI>Barbot,</HI> A|gent General of the <HI>French African</HI> Company, who &s;ays; <Q>The <HI>Hollanders,</HI> a People very zealous for their Commerce at the Coa&s;t, were very
<PB N="10" REF="009066_0009_1031183699EFE098">&s;tudious to have the War carried on among&s;t the <HI>Blacks,</HI> to di&s;tract, as long as po&s;&s;ible, the Trade of the other <HI>Europeans;</HI> and to that Ef|fect were very ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t upon all Occa&s;ions the <HI>Blacks,</HI> their Allies, that they might beat their Enemies, and &s;o the Commerce fall into their Hands.</Q> But nothing &s;hews more plain|ly, that the <HI>Europeans</HI> are the chief In&s;truments in inciting the <HI>Negroes</HI> to the Perpetration of tho&s;e unnatural Wars, by which they are kept in conti|nual Alarms, their Country laid wa&s;te, and &s;uch great Numbers carried into Captivity, than the Account given by <HI>William Smith,</HI> who was &s;ent by the <HI>African</HI> Company to vi&s;it their Settle|ments in the Year 1726, from the Information he received of one of the Factors, who had re|&s;ided ten Years in that Country, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That the di&s;cerning Natives account it their greate&s;t Unhappine&s;s that they were ever vi&s;ited by the <HI>Europeans:</HI>&mdash;That we Chri&s;tians introduced the Traffick of Slaves, and that before our coming they lived in Peace; but, &s;ay they, it is ob&s;ervable, that wherever Chri&s;tianity comes, there comes with it a Sword, a Gun, Powder and Ball.</Q></P>
<P>As to the Account of the natural Di&s;po&s;ition of many of the <HI>Negroes,</HI> and of the Fruitfulne&s;s of their Country, the forementioned Authors, as well as many others, have wrote largely upon it. <HI>M. Adan&s;on,</HI> in his Account of the Country and Natives of <HI>Goree,</HI> where he was &s;o lately as the Year 1754, after giving an Account of the de|lightful A&s;pect of the Country, &s;ays; <Q>The Sim|plicity
<PB N="11" REF="009066_0010_1031183B2325F490">of the Natives, their Dre&s;s and Man|ners, revived in my Mind the Idea of our fir&s;t Parents; and I &s;eemed to contemplate the World in its primitive State;&mdash;they (the <HI>Ne|groes</HI>) are generally &s;peaking, very good na|tured, &s;ociable and obliging. I was not a lit|tle plea&s;ed (&s;ays he) with this my fir&s;t Recep|tion; &mdash;it convinced me, that there ought to be a con&s;iderable Abatement made in the Ac|counts I had read and heard every where of the &s;avage Character of the <HI>Africans.</HI>&mdash;I ob&s;erved, both in <HI>Negroes</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> great Humanity and Sociablene&s;s, which gave me &s;trong Hopes that I &s;hould be very &s;afe among&s;t them, and meet with the Succe&s;s I de&s;ired in my Enquiries after the Curio&s;ities of the Coun|try.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Bo&s;man,</HI> &s;peaking of the <HI>Negroes</HI> of that Part <HI>Guiney</HI> where he then was, &s;ays; <Q>They are ge|nerally a good Sort of People, hone&s;t in their Dealings; others he de&s;cribes as being gene|rally friendly to Strangers, of a mild Conver|&s;ation, courteous, affable, and ea&s;y to be over|come with Rea&s;on; in Conver&s;ation they di&s;|cover a great Quickne&s;s of Parts and Under|&s;tanding.</Q> He adds, <Q>That &s;ome <HI>Negroes,</HI> who have had an agreeable Education, have manife&s;ted a Brightne&s;s of Under&s;tanding equal to any of us.</Q></P>
<P><HI>William Smith</HI>'s Account of the Natives is, <Q>That he found them a civil good natured People, indu&s;trious to the la&s;t Degree, and their Country exceeding Fertile.&mdash;It is ea&s;y
<PB N="12" REF="009066_0011_1031183CF6B62A20">(&s;ays he) to perceive what happy Memories they are ble&s;&s;ed with, and how great Progre&s;s they would make in the Sciences, in ca&s;e their Genius was cultivated with Study: They ex|plain them&s;elves in choice Terms, their Ex|pre&s;&s;ions noble, and Manners polite;&mdash;this (he adds) is to be under&s;tood of the People of Di&s;tinction, as Officers, Merchantmen, and the like; for Pea&s;ants, Workmen and Shep|herds, are as ignorant in the&s;e Parts as el&s;e|where.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Barbot</HI> &s;ays, <Q>The Inhabitants of <HI>Oedo</HI> are, for the Generality, very civil, good natured People, ea&s;y to be dealt with, conde&s;cending to what the <HI>Europeans</HI> require of them, in a civil Way; but if treated with Haughtine&s;s and rudely, they are &s;tiff and high, and will not yield on any Account.</Q></P>
<P>Some Writers have repre&s;ented the Natives of <HI>Cape Me&s;urado</HI> as faithle&s;s and cruel; but it is very likely this Repre&s;entation of their Di&s;po&s;i|tion was occa&s;ioned by the Re&s;entment they had &s;hewn for the ill U&s;age received from the <HI>Euro|peans;</HI> for Captain <HI>Philips</HI> declared them to be ci|vil and courteous. And <HI>Snoek</HI> &s;ays, <Q>He found them a civil good-natur'd People; but that the late Injury they had received from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who had carried off &s;ome of their People, had &s;o exa&s;perated them, that it was to be feared &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> People they had in their Power, would fall a Sacrifice to their Re&s;entment.</Q></P>
<P>Although the extream Heat in many Parts of <HI>Guiney,</HI> is &s;uch as is neither agreeable nor healthy
<PB N="13" REF="009066_0012_1031183E82C39888">to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> yet it is well &s;uited to the Con|&s;titution of the <HI>Negroes:</HI> And it is to the&s;e Heats that they are indebted for the fertility of their Land, which in mo&s;t Places is &s;o great, that with little Labour Grain and Fruit will grow in the greate&s;t Plenty.</P>
<P><HI>Brue,</HI> in his Account of the Fertility of the Country, and Indu&s;try of the Natives, &s;ays; <Q>He was &s;urprized to &s;ee the Land &s;o well culti|vated, as he ob&s;erved it to be, in one of his Journies; &s;carce a Spot lay unimproved; the low Grounds, divided by &s;mall Canals, were all &s;owed with Rice; the higher Grounds planted with <HI>Indian</HI> Corn and Millet, and Pea&s;e of different Sorts, Beef and Mutton very cheap, as well as all other Nece&s;&s;aries of Life.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Bo&s;man</HI> &s;ays, <Q>The <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>Guiney</HI> Corn is here &s;own and reaped twice every Year; the fir&s;t Harve&s;t is in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and the other the latter End of the Year, though but &s;mall, Corn grows with little Trouble, very &s;peedily taking Root, &s;o that one or two Men can manure and plow as much Land as one Plow can turn up in <HI>Holland. Indian</HI> Corn grows in the upper Lands, in prodigious Quan|tities, and where Corn won't grow, there Rice encrea&s;es in Abundance, and Yamms and Po|tatoes are in the greate&s;t Plenty.</Q></P>
<P>Speaking of the Kingdom of <HI>Fida,</HI> he &s;ays, <Q>The Country was very populous, many large Villages, be&s;ides innumerable &s;mall Ones, through the whole Country, plentifully pro|vided with Corn, Potatoes and Fruit, which
<PB N="14" REF="009066_0013_103118422F2440A8">grew clo&s;e to each other; in &s;ome Places a Foot Path is the only Ground that is not co|vered with them, the <HI>Negroes</HI> leaving no Place, which is thought fertile, uncultivated, even within the Hedges which inclo&s;e their Villages: And the very next Day after they have reaped they are &s;ure to &s;ow again. This &s;ine Country is now very much depopulated, which it is likely, was owing to the Incur|&s;ions made upon them by their Neighbours, in order to get Slaves to &s;ell to the <HI>Europeans.</HI></Q> For the &s;ame <HI>Bo&s;man,</HI> &s;peaking of the neigh|bouring Nation of <HI>Pope,</HI> &s;ays; <Q>They depend on Plunder and the Slave Trade, in which they exceed &s;ome of their Neighbours.</Q></P>
<P>Other Parts of the Country he de&s;cribes, as <Q>being full of Towns and Villages; the Soil very rich, and &s;o well cultivated, as to look like and entire Garden, abounding in Rice, Corn, Oxen, Goats and Poultry; and the <HI>Negroes</HI> to be laborious.</Q></P>
<P><HI>W. Smith</HI> gives much the &s;ame Account of the Country of <HI>Delmina,</HI> and <HI>Cape Cor&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. for Beauty and Goodne&s;s; and adds, <Q>The more you come downward towards that Part called the <HI>Slave Coa&s;t</HI> (I &s;uppo&s;e becau&s;e the mo&s;t Slaves are brought from thence) the more de|lightful and rich the Sol appears.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Barbot</HI> &s;ays, <Q>The Inland People employ them&s;elves in Tillage and Trade, and &s;upply the Markets with Corn, Fruit and Palm Wine; the Country producing &s;uch va&s;t Plenty of <HI>In|dian</HI> Wheat, that Abundance is daily export|ed,
<PB N="15" REF="009066_0014_1031184592673650">as well by <HI>Europeans</HI> as <HI>Blacks,</HI> re&s;orting thither from other Parts.</Q> He adds, <Q>That the Country of <HI>Delmina,</HI> which was formerly very powerful and populous, though now &s;o much drained of its Inhabitants, by the inte|&s;tine Wars fomented among&s;t the <HI>Negroes</HI> by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that there does not remain enough Inhabitants to till the Country; abounded with fine well-built and populous Towns, enriched with va&s;t Fields of Corn, Cattle, Palm Wine and Oil. The Inhabitants all applying them&s;elves, without Di&s;tinction, to Agriculture, &s;owing Corn, pre&s;&s;ing Oil, and drawing Wine from Palm Trees, with both of which it is plentifully &s;tored others to fi&s;hing, and boiling Salt, and other Trades, on their own Account, or as Brokers for the Inland Blacks.</Q></P>

<P><HI>Francis Moore,</HI> Factor to the <HI>african</HI> Compa|ny in 1730, tells his Reader, <Q>That when the King of <HI>Bar&s;alli</HI> wants Goods or Brandy, he

He often goes with &s;ome of his Troops by a Town in the Day-time, and returns in the Night, and &s;ets Fire to three Parts of it, placing Guards at the Fourth, to &s;eize the People that run out of the Fire, then ties their Arms behind them, and marches them to <HI>Joar</HI> or <HI>Rohone,</HI> where he &s;ells them.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Brue,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Factor bef&oacute;re-mentioned, &s;ays, <Q>That having received Goods, he wrote to the King, that if he had a &s;ufficient Number of Slaves, he was ready to trade with him, this Prince, &s;ays that Author, as well as the other <HI>Negroe</HI> Monarchs, have always a &s;ure Way of &s;upplying his Deficiencies, by &s;elling their own Subjects, for which they &s;eldom want Preten&s;ions of &s;ome Kind or other, to ju&s;tify their Rapine.</Q> The&s;e <HI>Negroe</HI> Kings, thus &s;eeking Pretences to cover their Crimes, &s;hews they are not quite void of Shame, and in|&s;en&s;ible that Covetou&s;ne&s;s induces them to act a

<P><HI>John Barbot</HI> &s;ays, <Q>The Slaves &s;old by the <HI>Negroes</HI> are for the mo&s;t Part Pri&s;oners of War, or taken in the Incur&s;ions they make in|to their Enemies Territories; others are &s;tolen away by their own Countrymen. Abundance of little <HI>Blacks,</HI> of both Sexes, are &s;tolen away by their Neighbours, when found abroad, on the Roads, or in the Woods, or el&s;e in the Corn Fields, at the Time of the Year when their Parents keep them there all Day, to &s;care away the devouring &s;mall Birds.</Q></P>

<PB N="19" REF="009066_0018_1031184F8BF44998">three Slaves taken up at the neare&s;t Village. Unhappy (&s;ays that Author) are they, who at that Time fall into the Hands of his Guards, for they &s;tay to make no Choice.</Q> And he further &s;ays, <Q>That in Battle they &s;pare the Enemies as much as po&s;&s;ible, but it is only that they may have the more Slaves; from which even Per&s;ons of Quality, taken Pri&s;oners, are not exempted: That the Merchants bring down &s;ome Years, to that Factory, to the Amount of Two Thou&s;and Slaves; which, they &s;ay, are taken Pri&s;oners in War: The&s;e they buy from the different Princes who take them; many of them come from a great Way In-land. Their Way of bringing them, is tying them by the Neck with Leather Thongs, at about a Yard Di&s;tance from each other, hav|ing generally a Bundle of Corn, or Elephants Teeth, on each of their Heads, Thirty or Forty in a String.</Q> The Author judges, <Q>That the Number of Merchants who followed this Trade were about an Hundred.</Q> Some Authors &s;ay, <Q>They go Six or Seven Hundred Miles up the Country, with Goods bought from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with which they purcha&s;e the&s;e Slaves, and Ivory: Be&s;ides tho&s;e Slaves, there are many bought along the River; the&s;e are either taken in War, as the former, or Men condemned for Crimes, or Per&s;ons &s;tolen, which is very frequently. Since the Slave Trade has been introduced, all Puni&s;hments are commuted in this; and they &s;train hard for Crimes, in order to have the Benefit of &s;elling
<PB N="20" REF="009066_0019_10311851160B43C8">the Criminal; &s;o that not only great Crimes but even trifling ones, are at pre&s;ent puni&s;hed with Slavery.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Bo&s;man</HI> &s;ays, That being in the Kingdom of <HI>Pope,</HI> who depend on Plunder and the Slaves Trade, in which they exceed &s;ome of their Neighbours, becau&s;e, being endued with a much larger Share of Courage, they rob more &s;ucce&s;s|fully, they a&s;&s;ured him, that if he would have Patience for three Days, they would be able to deliver him One or Two Hundred Slaves, and that their Incur&s;ions &s;ucceeded &s;o well, they re|turned with about Two Hundred Slaves. That the Inhabitants of <HI>Arda</HI> were &s;o diligent in the Slave Trade, that they were able to deliver a Thou&s;and Slaves every Month; and that if there happened to be no Stock of Slaves when the Ve&s;|&s;els arrived, they would &s;ometimes &s;end their Commodities Two Hundred Miles deep in the Country (a later Author &s;ays, they have now car|ried the Trade Five Hundred Miles farther, go|ing now Seven Hundred Miles back into the Country) where Markets of Men were kept in the &s;ame Manner as tho&s;e of Bea&s;ts with us. Mo&s;t of the Slaves are Pri&s;oners of War, which are &s;old by the Victors as their Booty. When the&s;e Slaves come to <HI>Fida,</HI> they are put in Pri&s;on alto|gether; and when (&s;ays he) we treat concerning baying them, they are all brought out together in a large Plain, where, by our Surgeons, they are thoroughly examined, and that naked too, both Men and Women, without the lea&s;t Di&s;tinction or Mode&s;ty.

What Nece&s;&s;ity does the Author mean, no other Nece&s;&s;ity appears but that ari&s;ing from the De&s;ire of ama&s;&s;ing Riches; a Nece&s;&s;ity laid on worldly Men by their hard Ta&s;k-ma&s;ter the De|vil? Many more Examples might be given to &s;hew the arbitrary and tyrannick Oppre&s;&s;ion with which this Trade is carried on, and the Deva&s;ta|tion and Blood&s;hed it occa&s;ions in tho&s;e unhappy People's Country; but I tru&s;t this is &s;ufficient to convince the candid, con&s;iderate Reader of the
<PB N="22" REF="009066_0021_10311855EE148DF8">Unlawfulne&s;s and Iniquity of the Trade. And indeed what Di&s;tre&s;s can we conceive equal to the Alarms, the Anxiety and Wrath, which mu&s;t &s;ucceed one another in the Brea&s;ts of the tender Parents, or affectionate Children, in continual Danger of being torn one from another, and dragged into a State of cruel Bondage; Reader, if the Impre&s;&s;ions of Grace, or even the com|mon Feelings of Humanity, are not &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in thy Heart by the Love of Gain, compare what thou ha&s;t read with the Equity, the Sympa|thy, the Tenderne&s;s and affectionate Love which is the Life of Chri&s;tianity, and then &s;ay, what Concord or Affinity can the&s;e Fruits have one with the other. May not this Trade be truly &s;aid to be the mo&s;t iniquitous and cruele&s;t Act of Vio|lence and Rapine, when con&s;idered in all its Cir|cum&s;tances, that, to our Knowledge, is perpe|trated in any Part of the World, and that there|fore it behoves every one who is de&s;irous to main|tain the Te&s;timony of a good Con&s;cience, and enjoy Re&s;t and Peace in Time and Eternity, to avoid being, in any Re&s;pect, defiled by the Gain re&s;ulting therefrom. And Thanks be to the Great Father of the Family of the whole Earth, that it is not alone in <HI>America</HI> that &s;ome are rai&s;ed to bear their Te&s;timony again&s;t this mighty Evil, but that a noble Indignation is al&s;o rai&s;ed in the Brea&s;ts of &s;ome in our Mother Country, zea|lou&s;ly to declare again&s;t &s;o unparalelled Inva&s;ion upon the Rights and Liberties of Mankind, par|ticularly <HI>George Wallis,</HI> a Gentleman of the Law, in a Book wrote by him, intituled, <HI>A Sy|&s;tem
<PB N="23" REF="009066_0022_103118594CC07338">of the Principles of the Law of</HI> Scotland; in which, &s;peaking of the Slavery of the <HI>Negroes</HI> in our Colonies, he &s;ays; "We all know that they (the <HI>Negroes</HI>) are purcha&s;ed from their Princes, who pretend to have a Right to di&s;|po&s;e of them, and that they are, like other Commodities, tran&s;ported by the Merchants, who have bought them, into <HI>America,</HI> in or|der to be expo&s;ed to Sale. If this Trade ad|mits of a moral or a rational Ju&s;tification, every Crime, even the mo&s;t atrocious, may be ju&s;tified. Government was in&s;tituted for the Good of Mankind; Kings, Princes, Gover|nors, are not Proprietors of tho&s;e who are &s;ub|ject to their Authority; they have not a Right to make them mi&s;erable. On the contrary, their Authority is ve&s;ted in them, that they may, by the ju&s;t Exerci&s;e of it, promote the Happine&s;s of their People. Of Cour&s;e, they they have not a Right to di&s;po&s;e of their Li|berty, and to &s;ell them for Slaves. Be&s;ides, no Man has a Right to acquire or to purcha&s;e them; Men and their Liberty are not <HI>(in Com|mercio)</HI> they are not either &s;aleable or pur|cha&s;eable. One, therefore, has no body but him&s;elf to blame, in ca&s;e he &s;hall find him&s;elf deprived of a Man, whom he thought he had, by buying for a Price, made his own; for he dealt in a Trade which was illicit, and was prohibited by the mo&s;t obvious Dictates of Hu|manity. For the&s;e Rea&s;ons every one of tho&s;e unfortunate Men, who are pretended to be Slaves, has a Right to be declared to be free,
<PB N="24" REF="009066_0023_1031185AD456CD68">for he never lo&s;t his Liberty; he could not lo&s;e it; his Prince had no Power to di&s;po&s;e of him. Of Cour&s;e the Sale was <HI>ip&s;o Jure</HI> void. This Right he carries about with him, and is entitled every where to get it declared. As &s;oon, therefore, as he comes into a Coun|try in which the Judges are not forgetful of their own Humanity, it is their Duty to re|member that he is a Man, and to declare him to be free. I know it has been &s;aid, that Que|&s;tions concerning the State of Per&s;ons ought to be determined by the Law of the Country to which they belong; and that, therefore, one who would be declared to be a Slave in <HI>America,</HI> ought, in ca&s;e he &s;hould happen to be imported into <HI>Britain,</HI> to be adjudged ac|cording to the Law of <HI>America</HI> to be a Slave; a Doctrine than which nothing can be more barbarous. Ought the Judges of any Coun|try, out of Re&s;pect to the Law of another, to &s;hew no Re&s;pect to their Kind, and to Huma|nity. Out of Re&s;pect to a Law, which is in no Sort obligatory upon them, ought they to di&s;regard the Law of Nature, which is obli|gatory on all Men at all Times, and in all Places: Are any Laws &s;o binding as the eter|nal Laws of Ju&s;tice? Is it doubtful, whether a Judge ought to pay greater Regard to them, than to tho&s;e arbitrary and inhuman U&s;ages which prevail in a di&s;tant Land? Aye, but our Colonies would be ruined, if Slavery was aboli&s;hed. Be it &s;o; would it not from thence follow, that the Bulk of Mankind ought to be
<PB N="25" REF="009066_0024_1031185C59EBECE0">abu&s;ed, that our Pockets may be filled with Money, or our Mouths with Delicacies? The Pur&s;es of Highwaymen would be empty in ca&s;e Robberies were totally aboli&s;hed; but have Men a Right to acquire Money by going out to the Highway? Have Men a Right to acquire it by rendering their Fellow Creatures mi&s;erable? Is it lawful to abu&s;e Mankind, that the Avarice, the Vanity, or the Pa&s;&s;ions of a few may be gratified? No! there is &s;uch a Thing as Ju&s;tice, to which the mo&s;t &s;acred Regard is due. It ought to be inviolably ob|&s;erved. Have not the&s;e unhappy Men a better Right to their Liberty, and to their Happine&s;s, than our <HI>American</HI> Merchants have to the Pro|fits which they make by torturing their Kind? Let therefore our Colonies be ruined, but let us not render &s;o many Men mi&s;erable. Would not any of us, who &s;hould&mdash;be &s;natched by Pyrates from his native Land, think him&s;elf cruelly abu&s;ed, and at all Times intitled to be free. Have not the&s;e unfortunate <HI>Africans,</HI> who meet with the &s;ame cruel Fate, the &s;ame Right? Are not they Men as well as we, and have they not the &s;ame Sen&s;ibility? Let us not, therefore, defend or &s;upport a U&s;age which is contrary to all the Laws of Humanity.</P>
<P>But it is fal&s;e, that either we or our Colonies would be ruined by the Abolition of Slavery. It might occa&s;ion a Stagnation of Bu&s;ine&s;s for a &s;hort Time. Every great Alteration pro|duces that Effect; becau&s;e Mankind cannot, on a &s;udden, find Ways of di&s;po&s;ing of them|&s;elves,
<PB N="26" REF="009066_0025_1031185FB88D4798">and of their Affairs: But it would pro|duce many happy Effects. It is the Slavery which is permitted in <HI>America</HI> that has hindered it from becoming &s;o &s;oon populous, as it would otherwi&s;e have done. Let the <HI>Negroes</HI> free, and, in a few Generations, this va&s;t and fertile Continent would be crowded with Inhabitants; Learning, Arts, and every Thing would flou|ri&s;h among&s;t them; in&s;tead of being inhabited by wild Bea&s;ts, and by Savages, it would be peopled by Philo&s;ophers, and by Men."&mdash; Thus far this hone&s;t and noble &s;pirited <HI>Briton.</HI></P>
<P>And now Reader, if from the Example of others, and without a &s;ufficient Knowledge of the deplorable Con&s;equences attendant on this Trade, thou ha&s;t inadvertently engaged therein, let me be&s;eech thee, by the Mercies of CHRIST JESUS our LORD (tho&s;e Mercies which, perhaps, e'er long, thou and I &s;hall de&s;ire to fly to as our only Refuge) that thou would&s;t refrain a Prac|tice &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with thy Duty, both as a Chri|&s;tian and a Man.

Can any Thing be more cruel and bar|barous, than to &s;eize upon human Creatures, and take them away by Force from their native Coun|try, from their Friends and Relations, for ever; Children from their tender Parents, Parents from their dear Children, Women from their beloved Hu&s;bands, and Hu&s;bands from their beloved Wives, and drive them, like Hogs, to Market, there to be &s;old for Slaves for Life? How great mu&s;t be the Mi&s;ery tho&s;e poor Creatures are in, and the Agonies of Mind they fell, when they are thus carried off; &s;o great, that, to relieve them&s;elves, &s;ome of them have put an End to their Lives. And how grievous, how di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, mu&s;t be the Condition of their Friends and Rela|tions, who are deprived of them, and &s;hall never &s;ee their Faces any more? It is horrid, it is &s;hock|ing to think of &s;uch Cruelty and Barbarity. What Mon&s;ters in Nature then, de&s;titute of all Humanity and Compa&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t they be, who are guilty of it. The black Men have the &s;ame natural Affection for their Kindred, and as &s;trong, as we have.&mdash;To &s;ell and buy human Crea|tures,
<PB N="33" REF="009066_0032_10311870CC379810">without their Con&s;ent, yea and &s;ore again&s;t, their Will, to trade in Men, as you would in brute Creatures, or any other Commodities, is really impious as well as cruel. Man is a noble Creature, made but a little lower than the An|gels, and crowned with Glory and Honour. He is the Offspring of GOD; therefore thus to de|ba&s;e him, and to bring him down upon a Level with the Brutes, yea with Things inanimate, is great Impiety, it is an high Affront offered to him, who is the kind and merciful Father of us all, who hath made of one Blood all Nations of Men, to dwell on the Face of the Earth, and hath united them all in one Body by the Ties of Nature. It is likewi&s;e an Affront put upon Man|kind, upon the whole human Race, which &s;hould rai&s;e a generous Re&s;entment and Indignation in the Brea&s;t of every one that partakes of the human Nature, and has any Notion of the Dignity of it, or any Sen&s;e of Humanity, which he &s;hould expre&s;s and di&s;cover upon all proper Occa&s;ions, and in all proper Ways.&mdash;And I think the Re|ceiver, in this Ca&s;e, will appear to be wor&s;e, to be more guilty, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, than the bare Thief, if we fairly con&s;ider the Matter.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the <HI>Europeans,</HI> in &s;ending Ships yearly to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> to buy Slaves, without enquiring how tho&s;e they purcha&s;e them of came by them, do encourage tho&s;e Thieves, and tempt them to make a Practice and Trade of &s;tealing their own Countrymen; for this is the &s;ame Thing in Effect, as if they were to tell them in &s;o many Words, <Q><HI>You get Men ready for us,
<PB N="34" REF="009066_0033_103118784FE492B0">how you can, and we will take them off your Hands.</HI></Q> Be&s;ides, tho&s;e Men-merchants not only encourage others in this cruel flagitious Prac|tice of Man-&s;tealing, but are really guilty of it them&s;elves. You will ob&s;erve, that what is done by their Command, and according to their Or|ders, I con&s;ider as done by them&s;elves. As tho&s;e poor mi&s;erable Creatures were &s;tolen, tho&s;e who did &s;teal them, could not convey any Right in them to others, though the&s;e others &s;hould give ever &s;o much in Purcha&s;e of them, any more than if they had them for nothing. For tho&s;e Purcha&s;ers then to deprive them of their Liberty, and, by Force, keep them in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in whom they have no Right (&s;uppo&s;ing one Man could be the Property of another) and who never injured them in the lea&s;t, nor forfeited their Li|berty; to keep them in Bonds, and carry them away Captives, is, properly &s;peaking, Man-&s;teal|ing. And what aggravates this Crime in the <HI>European</HI> Man-merchants, and renders it much more heinous in them than in the <HI>Africans,</HI> is, that the former enjoy the Light of the Go&s;pel, and profe&s;s them&s;elves to be Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Man-&s;tealing is a Kind, and indeed the wor&s;t Kind, of Sacrilege, which Con&s;ideration farther &s;hews the Impiety of it. Man is &s;acred, and is, by Nature, devoted to the Service of GOD, to who&s;e Authority alone he is obliged to yield an ab&s;olute, unlimited Obedience; for one Man therefore to a&s;&s;ault another, and, by meer Force, to make a Captive of him, not for any Crime that he has been guilty of, but to make a <HI>Penny</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="009066_0034_10311879D8D7C978">of him, con&s;idering him as Part of his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions or Goods, with which he can do what he plea&s;es, is robbing of GOD, which is Sacrilege.</P>
<P>It is very common in the Countries, where the <HI>Europeans</HI> carry on this Trade, for the petty Kings and Princes, of which there are a great many, to go to War with their Neighbours, not in Defence of their Right, not to get Satisfaction for any Injuries done them, or to repair any Damages they have unju&s;tly &s;uffered by tho&s;e Neighbours, but purely to get Pri&s;oners again&s;t the Time the Ships from <HI>Europe</HI> arrive upon their Coa&s;t, that with them they may be able to purcha&s;e of the Captains of tho&s;e Ships the Goods they have on board.</P>
<P>Now here the Injury and Crime is the &s;ame in Kind as in the former Ca&s;e, and indeed greater in the Kind: In both Ca&s;es it is &s;tealing Man, but in the latter it is attended with &s;hedding of Blood, with Slaughter and De&s;truction; which Con&s;ideration doth aggravate the Crime of our <HI>Guiney</HI> Merchants, who purcha&s;e tho&s;e Pri&s;oners. CHRIST hath &s;aid, that <HI>ble&s;&s;ed are the Peace|makers, for they &s;hall be called the Children of</HI> GOD. But how contrary to what our Saviour recom|mends, the making of Peace among Men, is the Spirit and Practice of tho&s;e, who, for Lucre Sake, provoke and encourage others to go to War with their Neighbours, and by unju&s;t Force to kill and de&s;troy &s;ome, and others of them to make Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>But let us now &s;uppo&s;e,&mdash;that the Pri&s;oners, which are bought, were even engaged in an un|ju&s;t

<P>It is reckoned we have now in this Kingdom Thirty Thou&s;and <HI>French</HI> Pri&s;oners, or more; and we &s;ay, that in the War we are carrying on again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> we have Right on our Side; that we entered into it for the Recovery and Defence of our Territories, invaded by them; but though it be true (as I believe it is) that our Cau&s;e is good, yet would it not be cruel and inhuman in us, to &s;ell the&s;e Pri&s;oners into Slavery for Life,

Six were hung alive in Chains on Gibbets, and &s;tarved to Death; after which their Heads were cut off, and their Bodies burnt; and Fifty-eight others were, at &s;everal Times, chained to Stakes, and burnt alive." Now, was not this a lamentable Affair (and there have been &s;everal In&s;tances of &s;uch Cruelty in our Planta|tions) that &s;o many poor Creatures &s;hould be put to the greate&s;t Tortures, and be made to &s;uffer the mo&s;t painful Deaths.

<PB N="45" REF="009066_0044_10311895A4D81930">di&s;covered in Time, failed in their Attempt. Now &s;hould not we have been reckoned, by all the World, a cruel barbarous People, if the Go|vernment had ordered &s;ome of them to be broke on the Wheel, &s;ome to be burnt alive, and others to be &s;tarved to Death, though the <HI>French</HI> are our Enemies, and are engaged in an unju&s;t War again&s;t us; whereas tho&s;e Slaves had never done any Hurt or Injury to tho&s;e who torture them to Death.&mdash;We reckon our&s;elves to be a brave, generous, humane, civilized People;&mdash;but is this a true Character, while that barbarous, &s;a|vage Man-Trade, in the carrying on of which &s;o many Thou&s;and Lives are &s;acrificed every Year, is not only winked at, but countenanced and en|couraged among&s;t us.&mdash;There are other Na|tions in <HI>Europe,</HI> be&s;ides ours, concerned in this Trade, but that does not le&s;&s;en the Guilt in our People, though it may keep them in Counte|nance; but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are now more concerned, I believe, than all the other Nations in <HI>Europe,</HI> taken together, in this abominable Trade, which is the greate&s;t Scandal and Reproach that lies upon this Nation; the removing of which, by proclaiming Liberty to tho&s;e Captives now in our Plantations, making them Freemen, and prohi|biting for ever, upon the &s;evere&s;t Penalties, the Man-Trade throughout all His Maje&s;ty's Domi|nions, and thereby leading the Way, and giving a good Example to the other Nations in <HI>Europe,</HI> concerned in the Man-Trade, would be much to the Honour of our Government, and I am &s;ure would give great Plea&s;ure to all who are Lovers

But if it were certain that this would be the Ca&s;e, this Con&s;ideration cannot be a ju&s;t Rea&s;on for our continuing to carry on &s;uch a wicked Trade. If we &s;hould not carry on this Trade others would, therefore we may, would be a &s;trange Way of rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>And as this Slave-Trade has been encouraged by the Government, for many Reigns back, it is queried, whether the pre&s;ent Government, in ca&s;e they were to &s;et tho&s;e <HI>Negroes</HI> in our Colo|nies at Liberty, &s;hould not make good that Lo&s;s to their Ma&s;ters; but I &s;hall not take upon me to determine that Point; our Governors are be&s;t Judges of that, only I think they had better do &s;o, though it &s;hould require &s;ome Millions to do it, than &s;uffer tho&s;e poor Creatures to continue in the mi&s;erable State of Slavery they are now in. There is one Con&s;equence more which, &s;ome People fear, would follow upon prohibiting of the <HI>Negroe</HI> Trade, and that is, that &s;uch a Prohi|bition would greatly le&s;&s;en, if not utterly ruin, &s;ome other con&s;iderable Branches of our Com|merce, e&s;pecially the Sugar and the Tobacco Trades, becau&s;e of the Difficulty of getting Hands enough, in the Room of the <HI>Blacks,</HI> to work

Con&s;ider how you &s;hall come off in the great and awful Day of Account. You now heap up Riches, and live in Plea&s;ure; but oh! what will you do in the End thereof? and that is not far off.
