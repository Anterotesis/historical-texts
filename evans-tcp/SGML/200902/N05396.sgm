<P>IN a true and living Remembrance of this our dear Brother, ancient and faithful Servant and Mini&s;ter of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Richard Davies,</HI> and of that dear and brotherly Love, which remain|ed between us, and which he had to all faithful Friends and Brethren in Chri&s;t; I am concern'd to give this brief Te&s;timo|ny, in Commemoration of him, his Life, and faithful Go&s;pel Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>He was not only a Profe&s;&s;or of the Name, Power and Spirit of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but al&s;o made a Partaker of Chri&s;t in Spirit, Life and Conver&s;ation: A plain, meek and humble Man of Integrity; a Man fearing God, and hating Iniquity; a Man &s;ancti|fied by the Holy Spirit, unto unfeigned and con&s;tant Love of his Brethren in Chri&s;t; a Man &s;ound in Faith, in Pati|ence, and Charity, of a &s;ound Mind and

<P>His Te&s;timony and Mini&s;try was evan|gelical, plain and &s;ound; not in Words of Man's Wi&s;dom, but in the Demon&s;trati|on and plain Evidence of the Holy Spirit and Power of Chri&s;t: Being a Mini&s;ter of the Spirit, and of the New Te&s;tament; the New Covenant Di&s;pen&s;ation, which &s;tands not in legal Shadows, Types, out|ward Signs or Figures, but in the Go&s;|pel Life and Sub&s;tance, even in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in whom all the Shadows, and Di&s;|pen&s;ations thereof, are ended.</P>

<P>And as this Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ter did &s;ee and partake of the enduring Sub&s;tance, and End of all vani&s;hing Shadows, and carnal Ordinances; he well knew, that neither <HI>John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m with Water, nor any outward Wa&s;hings therewith (tho' once commanded) could ever &s;anctify or wa&s;h the In&s;ide from Siri and Pollution, or &s;prinkle and purify the Con&s;cience, or make a true Chri&s;tian; much le&s;s can Sprinkling Infan's which God never com|manded: But Chri&s;t's &s;piritual Bapti&s;m, and Wa&s;hing of Regeneration by the Wa|ter of Life, which is the One Bapti&s;in, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Bapti&s;m of the Spirit; this is the only &s;aving Bapti&s;m, as our &s;aid decea&s;|ed

<P>And I am fully per&s;waded, That as this our dear and well-beloved Friend and Brother, <HI>R.

<HEAD><HI>A &s;hort Te&s;timony concerning my dear and loving Father,</HI> Richard Davies, <HI>whom God, in his Mercy, took to Him&s;elf, the 22d Day of the</HI> Fir&s;t Month, 1707-8. <HI>He being about 72 Years, and Eleven Months old.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Can truly &s;ay, he was a dear and tender Father to me, in my young Years; and as I grew up, I had a Sen&s;e of his great Love and Care over me, and it &s;eized my Heart, &s;o that I often pray|ed to God that he would keep me from offending &s;o good a Father. And when
<PB REF="006833_0005_102A5F07BA279A90">I was capable of travelling with him, he u&s;ually took me along with him, in his Journeys to <HI>London,</HI> and el&s;ewhere: Many were the good Opportunities we had in travelling together, and vi&s;iting Friends at their Meetings.</P>
<P>And as his Care was to me, &s;o was it over mine al&s;o, which makes our Lo&s;s the greater; but I am &s;atisfied it is his great Gain. Oh! how often and fervent would be pray to the Almighty, that his Children might become the Children of the Lord, and that he might keep us from the Allurements and Defilements of this wicked World: And we hope the Lord will an&s;wer his Petitions on our Behalf.</P>
<P>My dear Father was &s;erviceable to mo&s;t Sorts of People, rich and poor, in the Country where he lived, and in other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">laces. He was ready to give his Advice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd Coun&s;el freely, both in Things relating to the Law, or the Go&s;pel; and he had much Place and Intere&s;t with &s;e|veral great Per&s;ons, and what he reque&s;t|ed of them, was generally granted him. And I may &s;ay it to the Prai&s;e of the Lord, he was well re&s;pected by mo&s;t Sorts of People, and the Lo&s;s of him is known among&s;t them?</P>
<P>He was very ready to &s;erve the Wi|dow and Fatherle&s;s, in what lay in his Power; and many were his Labours, and Travels of Love: But now he is cea&s;ed from them all, and I que&s;tion not but he is gone to his Eternal Re&s;t with God for ever. It is my De&s;ire, that we may prize the great Goodne&s;s and Lo|ving-kindne&s;s of the Lord, in &s;paring of him &s;o long unto us, for he had been but a weakly Man of Body the&s;e late Years.</P>
<P>About the 10th Month, 1688, my dear Father was &s;ick and weak, &s;o that mo&s;t that &s;aw him, thought he would not re|cover: But the Lord in his tender Mer|cy ordered our dear Friend <HI>Robert Bar|row</HI> and <HI>Robert Haydock</HI> to come into the&s;e Parts to vi&s;it Friends, and they came to our Hou&s;e at <HI>Wel&s;h-Pool,</HI> and they had a Meeting there; and as they were parting with my Father, they had it in their Hearts to pray, and they ear|ne&s;tly interceded with the Lord, <HI>That is might &s;tand good with His Will, to &s;pare him again unto us;</HI> for we were then a &s;orrowful Family. Afterwards. I re|member very well, dear <HI>Robert Barrow</HI> &s;poke, and &s;aid to my Father, <Q>Dear <HI>Richard,</HI> thou art a very weak Man, in the Sight of tho&s;e that &s;ee thee, and
<PB REF="006833_0006_102A5F095842BD38">not likely to live many Hours, as to &s;he natural Man's thinking; but the Lord has given it me at this Time to believe, I &s;hall &s;ee thee at our next Yearly-Meet|ing at <HI>London.</HI></Q> When I heard the&s;e Words, it was joyful News to me, and it proved very true, the Lord in his won|derful Mercy, and Loving kindne&s;s, re|&s;tored him to his Health, and next Spring He went to the Yearly-meeting at <HI>London,</HI> where al&s;o dear <HI>Robert Barrow</HI> was, and glad to &s;ee my Father there. This was all the Lord's Doings and His Works they are marvelous in our Eyes.</P>
<P>Much might be &s;aid; but my De&s;ire is, that as our ancient Friends, Fathers and Mothers in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> have bore the Burthen in the Heat of the Day (through many Tribulations and Afflictions, and now have re&s;ted from their Labours, and their Works follow them, and their Memorial is ble&s;&s;ed for evermore) &s;o that we al&s;o who are le&s;t, may walk in the Foot&s;teps of the Flock, and tread in the Path they have trod in. It is, as to the outward, an ea&s;y Way now to what our Ancients had; but the Enemy and Adver&s;ary of our immortal Souls is the &s;ame, and he is unwearied; therefore we ought to be very careful, and double
<PB REF="006833_0006_102A5F095842BD38">our Diligence, to be &s;ober and watchful, and cry ince&s;&s;antly to the Lord God of our Fathers, that he may be our God, and enable us to walk worthy of all His Mercies and Ble&s;&s;ings, every Way, for they are many.</P>
<P>And now I &s;hall give &s;ome Account of my dear Father's Departure. He was taken ill on the 6th Day of the Week, being the 19th of the Fir&s;t Month, 1707-8. On the Fir&s;t-day following, he &s;ent for &s;ome Friends of <HI>Dolobran</HI> Meeting, and &s;everal of them came to him, and had a Meeting with him in his Bed-Chamber; he de&s;ired Friends to pray to the Lord, That <HI>he might have an ea&s;y Pa&s;&s;age;</HI> adding, That <HI>the fer|vent Prayers of the Righteous, the Lord would have a Regard unto.</HI> And his Time being come, he departed this Life, as it were in a Sleep; and &s;o, as he hath often &s;aid, he went to &s;leep his long Sleep, it being about the 9th Hour in the Fore|noon, the 22d of Fir&s;t Month, 1707-8. And on the 25th following his Body was accompanied with a con&s;iderable Number of Friends and People to the Bu|rying-place, near his own Hou&s;e at <HI>Cloddiecochion,</HI> and there decently in|terr'd.</P>
<P><PB REF="006833_0007_102A5F0B34541288">
And now it is my De&s;ire, that all of us who have had &s;uch good Examples by our Parents, may follow them in Purity and Holine&s;s; &s;o that we may be &s;uch good Patterns to our Off-&s;pring, that when we lay down our Heads, and leave this natural Life, they may have cau&s;e to prai&s;e and glorify the Lord on our Account, as many of us can &s;ay we have had for our worthy Parents that are gone. And if we continue in well doing, and in the Fear of the Lord, there is no Que&s;tion but we &s;hall die in his Favour, which I de&s;ire may be the Lot of the whole Heritage of God.</P>

<P>HE was one of the fir&s;t of Friends in the&s;e Parts, who received the ble&s;&s;ed Truth in the Love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it; and
<PB REF="006833_0007_102A5F0B34541288">he laboured much in the Morning and Heat of the Day.</P>
<P>He and his Wife were very hearty, lo|wing, and ready to entertain Friends, their Hearts and Hou&s;e being very open in that re&s;pect; and they were very helpful and &s;erviceable to Friends in this Country, who were Pri&s;oners on Truth's Account in <HI>Wel&s;h-pool</HI> (the Place where they then lived) when there were but few other Friends of Ability to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, until the Lord rai&s;ed up &s;everal other eminent In&s;truments in the&s;e Parts, who were &s;erviceable with them.</P>
<P>Our &s;aid Friend was a wi&s;e and pru|dent Man; he had a good Under&s;tand|ing and Capacity, and was a Man of great Experience; and he was very wil|ling to advi&s;e and coun&s;el any in Things relating to the Go&s;pel and outward Affairs.</P>
<P>And as he was di&s;creet in his Conduct among Men, the Lord gave him great Place and Favour with &s;everal Per&s;ons of Note, with whom he had often good Service for Truth and Friends.</P>
<P>The Lord ble&s;&s;ed him with a good Gift in the Mini&s;try, and he was made an able Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, &s;ound in Judgment, and well received by mo&s;t People who heard him.</P>
<P><PB REF="006833_0008_102A5F0E4D564A98">
He travelled pretty much in divers Parts on Truth's Service, e&s;pecially in his younger Years, and had good Service in many Places where his Lot was ca&s;t, both at Home and Abroad; he was often at <HI>London,</HI> where he was well e&s;teemed by many of our Elders and Brethren.</P>
<P>He lived to a good old Age, and was favoured with a &s;hort Sickne&s;s at la&s;t. Some of us were with him the Day before his Departure; and he &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible that his End was near approaching, and he appeared as one that was waiting for the &s;ame. He departed this Life the 22d of the 1&s;t Mon. 1707-8. in the 73d Year of his Age; and we believe he is at Re&s;t with the Lord, together with many more of the faithful Followers of the Lamb.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not enlarge much further, but refer to the en&s;uing Account of his Labours, Travels and Services, for Truth and Friends, on &s;everal Occa&s;ions, which contains a general Relation of the mo&s;t remarkable Occurrences and Pa&s;&s;ages of Life, which was written by him&s;elf, not long before his Decea&s;e.</P>
<P>And we earne&s;tly de&s;ire, that all who make Profe&s;&s;ion of the glorious Truth with us, may really know a <HI>working out of their alvation with Fear and

<P>A Weighty Con&s;ideration came upon my Mind, in a Sen&s;e how the Almighty God, in his un&s;peakable and un&s;earchable Wi&s;dom, who di&s;cerneth the States and Conditions of the Sons and Daughters of Men, making Choice of &s;ome, and calleth them from among their Neigh|bours and Relations, to be &s;erviceable unto him; among&s;t whom our dear Friend RICHARD DAVIES was called ear|ly, in the Day of God's Vi&s;itation to &s;erve him, and he gave up in Obedience to the Lord, and took up the Cro&s;s in a Time of great Per&s;ecution, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Lord made him willing and obedient, in tho&s;e Days, to go abroad with a Publick Te&s;timony for the Truth, and moved him to come to our County of MERI|ONETHSHIRE, when &s;ome of us were very young in Years; and it plea&s;ed the Lord to make him in&s;trumental in his Hand to bring Glad-tidings to our Ears, and his Te&s;timony was &s;weet and comfortable, to the edifying and tendering of our Hearts and Souls. Many of us loved him exceedingly, and that Love remained between him and us till the End of his Days: He was tender and care|ful over us, and a Nouri&s;her and Strengthener of &s;ome of us in our &s;piritual, Exerci&s;es, and was ready to a&s;i&s;t the Weak and Feeble, and willing to give a helping Hand, Coun&s;el and Admonition to Friends and others, that had any De&s;ires to &s;erve the Lord.</P>
<P>O the wonderful Wi&s;dom and Love of God! who cal|led him, and many others in tho&s;e Days, and prepared
<PB REF="006833_0009_102A5F126B12C778">and qualified them for the great Work he had to do, and &s;trengthened them to tread the Way before us, that were weak and feeble: O what &s;trong, bold and valiant In&s;tru|ments did the Lord God prepare to begin to &s;trike at the great Image of Pride, Haughtine&s;s,, &amp;c. that was then, and yet is in the World! Indeed their Memorial is worthy to be recorded, that Ages yet to come might &s;ee what the Lord hath done for his faithful Ones, who gave up their Lives, and all they had, on Truth's Account.</P>
<P>I was acquainted with our &s;aid Friend for about Forty Years, and I can &s;ay of a Truth, That his Service was great in the Church of Chri&s;t, e&s;pecially in Times of Per&s;ecution; he having much Intere&s;t with the Magi|&s;trates, and them in Authority in tho&s;e Days. And his Hou&s;e was very open to entertain Friends to the utmo&s;t of his Ability; and the Lord ble&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>The Lord out of his Trea&s;ure of Grace, eminently en|dued him, to hear a &s;ound and &s;ea&s;onable Te&s;timony, when great A&s;&s;emblies and Multitudes of People were gathered together; and he had a &s;kilful Hand to admini&s;ter unto them the Way of Truth, and to open it to their Under|&s;tandings; which many Times gave them great Satisfac|tion, and they were made to &s;peak well of Truth and its Followers. O the deep Sen&s;e that remains upon me, of the great Want we have of the Service of &s;uch as he was! The Lord, who in his Mercy, qualified and &s;itted him, is able to prepare and rai&s;e up other faithful Labourers.</P>
<P>It affects me, when I remember his Gravity and gray Hairs, his manly Pre&s;ence, and lovely Countenance, e&s;pe|cially when he &s;tood up in a Meeting: Now he hath fi|ni&s;hed his Cour&s;e, and, I believe, hath done his Day's Work, and is gone to his Eternal Re&s;t.</P>
<P>Much more might be &s;aid on his Behalf, but I de&s;ire that none may mi&s;take me, I am not giving Honour to Man, that is but Du&s;t and A&s;hes; but that all might &s;ee how the Almighty God doth be&s;tow his &s;piritual Gifts upon tho&s;e whom he requireth Service at their Hands. And it is our Duty, as out Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t advi&s;ed his beloved Di&s;|ciples, "To pray to the Lord of the Harve&s;t (which Har|ve&s;t is great) that he would &s;end forth more faithful La|bourers into his Harve&s;t," that Mankind might be gathered into the inward Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Sub&s;tance of Chri&s;tianity,
<PB REF="006833_0010_102A5F1405199E48">which many outwardly profe&s;s; that the God of all our Mercies, and his beloved Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, may have all the Glory and Thank&s;giving, to whom it belongs, not only now, but henceforth for ever, and for evermore, AMEN.</P>

<P>We were diligent in Searching the Scriptures, which was good in its Place; but the main Matter and Sub&s;tance of pure Religion, is the Enjoyment of Eternal Life to the Soul from Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="006833_0011_102A5F1590040190">
About the Fourteenth Year of my Age, my Father intended to put me an Apprentice to a Shopkeeper, where I was for a Trial: But I &s;aw that the Conver&s;ation of my intended Ma&s;ter was not right, and that the Fear of the Lord was not there; I was afraid that if I &s;hould continue there, that the little Love and Zeal I had to God, and Good|ne&s;s, would be choak'd and quench'd in me, and the Love and Plea&s;ure of the World would get up again, &s;o I &s;hould be in Danger of growing wor&s;e than ever; and being under the&s;e &s;erious Con&s;idera|tions, I heartily pray'd to God with Ten|derne&s;s and Tears, what he put in my Heart to pray for, <HI>viz.</HI> That I might be delivered from that Place where I was intended to be bound an Apprentice, and that I might &s;pend my Time with and a|mong them that feared the Lord, and tho't upon his Name; and the Lord heard my Players, and in a little Time I was &s;ent for away from that Place.</P>
<P>After this I &s;taid at Home &s;ome Time, and continued in that little Well-doing I had known, keeping Company with &s;ober and hone&s;t People; I delighted to read the Scriptures and to go to the <HI>Inde|pendent</HI> Meetings. And after &s;ome Time.
<PB N="4" REF="006833_0012_102A5F1788783A68">I heard of a Man that profe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame Religion, who was very zealous for a Time in going to Meetings, and per|forming that which we call Family Du|ties, and there (with the Con&s;ent of my Parents) I bound my&s;elf an Appren|tice to him, who&s;e Name was <HI>Evan Jones,</HI> a Feltmaker, in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Lanfair,</HI> in <HI>Montgomery&s;hire;</HI> and we went together to Meetings, I writing and repeating Sormons, and performing that Cu&s;tom that was among us, in Praying in our own Will and Time, till we were become &s;o dead and formal, carnal airy, and many loo&s;e Words and Action growing up among&s;t us, that I was gone out of Conceit with my&s;elf, and our for|mal Religion; there being &s;omething in me that reproved me for my Vanity; and when I aro&s;e from my Prayers, being &s;ometime in a weighty ponderous Con|dition, I &s;aw that there was &s;omething that gave me no true Peace nor Comfort in wardly to my Soul, becau&s;e there re|mained a &s;ecret Pride and Self-exaltati|on in mo&s;t if not all our formal Perfor|mances.</P>
<P>In this State and Condition, I knew not what to do; when neither Writing, Repeating Sermons, Reading of the Scrip|tures,
<PB N="5" REF="006833_0012_102A5F1788783A68">and other good Books, and &s;ome|times Expounding of them, to the be&s;t of my Under&s;tanding afforded me any Com|fort, I was at a Lo&s;s, and knew not what Way to take, that I might have Peace and Comfort in my Performances. Hi|therto I knew not the Holy Spirit of the Lord (as I ought to have done) to be my Leader and Guider into all Things that were nece&s;&s;ary to my Eternal Salva|tion.</P>
<P>Upon a certain Time we had a Meet|ing at one <HI>Hugh Davids,</HI> a Tenant of <HI>Charles Lloyd</HI>'s of <HI>Dolobran,</HI> where one of our <HI>Independent</HI> Teachers (who was a great Scripturian) was Preaching, and I writ after him, and in his Sermon he &s;aid, <HI>The Time would come, that there would be no need of the Scripture any more than another Book:</HI> At which I very much &s;lumbled; and after the Meeting I asked him, when would that Time be? He &s;aid, when the Lord would make a New Covenant with his People, as is &s;aid in <HI>Jeremiah</HI> xxxi. 33, 34. <HI>I will make a new Covenant with the Hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>after tho&s;e Days, faith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and write is in their Hearts, and will be their God, and they
<PB N="6" REF="006833_0013_102A5F198C29E440">&s;hall be my People. And they &s;hall teach no more every Man his Neighbour, and every Man his Brother, &s;aying, Know the Lord, for they &s;hall all know me, from the lea&s;t of them to the greate&s;t of them faith the Lord; for I will forgive their Iniquity, and I will remember their Sin no more.</HI> It &s;eems that he knew not that Day come then, though he was a great Preacher. I thought it would then be a happy Day, when God would be the Teacher of his People him&s;elf; that we need not teach every Man his Neighbour, or his Brother, &s;aying, <HI>Know ye the Lord;</HI> but that we &s;hould all know Him, from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t: This Day we knew not then, for all our Preach|ing and long Prayers; though the Lord did then beget true Hung'rings and Thir&s;t|ings in our Souls after him: We had great Love and Zeal, and de&s;ired the Knowledge of the Truth, as it was in Je&s;us. Sometime I have &s;aid, This was but like <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Dream, when he awoke, he &s;aid, <HI>Surely the Lord is in this Place, and I knew it not.</HI> And indeed we knew not the Lord as we ought to have done; namely, by his Light, Grace and Spirit &s;hining in our Hearts, to give us the Light of the Knowledge of the Son
<PB N="7" REF="006833_0013_102A5F198C29E440">of God, which Knowledge keeps a Man meek and humble, and &s;uch are not puffed up in a vain Mind, to &s;eek after tho&s;e Things that are too high for them, as too many are climbing up that Way, which is not the Way to God the Fa|ther; the Way to the Father, is the Way of Holine&s;s and Purity, and Hu|mility, without which no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord, nor enjoy his Pre&s;ence to their Comfort.</P>
<P>About this Time, being in the Year 1656. our Mini&s;ters told us, That there was a Sort of People come up in the <HI>North,</HI> called <HI>Quakers,</HI> that were a Peo|ple of a &s;trange Po&s;ture and Principles, &s;aying that it was the la&s;t Days and Times, that Chri&s;t &s;poke of in the 24th of <HI>Matthew,</HI> <Q>Many &s;hall come in my Name, and deceive many (<HI>v.</HI> 5.) For there &s;hall ari&s;e fal&s;e Chri&s;ts, and fal&s;e Prophers, and &s;hall &s;hew great Signs and Wonders, in&s;omuch that (if it were po&s;&s;ible) they &s;hall deceive the very Elect.</Q> This Sort of People called <HI>Quakers</HI> were much preached again&s;t. They told us, they were the fal&s;e Pro|phets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that they denied the Scrip|tures, and all Ordinances, and al&s;o de|nied the very Chri&s;t that bought them;
<PB N="8" REF="006833_0014_102A5F1D4AAAE560">they were repre&s;ented to us to be &s;uch a dangerous Sort of People, that we were afraid of any who had the Name of a <HI>Quaker,</HI> le&s;t we &s;hould be deceived by them: Hitherto they had not been in the&s;e Parts of the Country, neither did we know what were their Principles held out by them&s;elves; but only &s;uch as were reported (tho' fal&s;ly) unto us by our Preachers and others, which kept us in Blindne&s;s, and from making further Inquiry, and "trying all Things, and holding fa&s;t that which is good," accor|ding to the Apo&s;tles Advice, 1 <HI>Tb.</HI> v. 21.</P>
<P>Now about the Year 1657, there came a poor Man in a mean Habit to my Ma|&s;ter's Hou&s;e, named <HI>Morgan Evan,</HI> of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> he had met with the Peo|ple called <HI>Quakers</HI> in his Travels, and was convinced of the Truth. This poor Man di&s;cour&s;ed with my Ma&s;ter about the Principles of Truth, and I being in the Shop about my Calling, my Mi&s;tre&s;s came and &s;aid, Why do you not go out to help your Ma&s;ter; for there is a <HI>Quaker</HI> at the Door that hath put him to Silence?

<PB N="11" REF="006833_0016_102A5F21A151A9C0">from our Hou&s;e, and I &s;et him a little along on his Way.</P>
<P>Now when I came back from him, the Con&s;ideration of his Words took fa&s;t hold on me, that I could not go from under them; and the more I waited in that Light, that he recommended me to, the more my former Peace, and that in which I formerly took Comfort in, was broken: And herein I came to &s;ee, that our former Building could not &s;tand; for we built upon that which the Apo|&s;tle called, <HI>Wood, Hay and Stubble.</HI> Here I came to a Lo&s;s of all my formal Know|ledge and my formal Performances prov'd but a &s;andy Foundation. Then I did, with much Humility, and Poverty of Spirit, beg of Almighty God, that I might build upon that Rock, that the true Church of Chri&s;t was built upon, that the Gates of Hell might not prevail again&s;t me.</P>
<P>But for all this, I was yet afraid of being deceived by the <HI>Quakers;</HI> yet where to go outwardly for Advice and Coun&s;el I knew not. For I &s;aw that my former Teachers were upon a &s;andy Foundation: So I de&s;ired that the God of <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> would be my Teacher and be fulfilled, and I believed that the Prophecy of the Pro|phets
<PB N="12" REF="006833_0017_102A5F27352B8AB0">would be &s;ulfilled, and that the Lord would make a New Covenant with his People now, as he did Promi&s;e by the Mouth of we Prophet <HI>Jerem.</HI> xxxi. 31.32, 33, 34. <Q>Behold, the Days come, &s;aith the Lord, that I will make a New Covenant with the Hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;|rael,</HI> and with the Hou&s;e of <HI>Judah;</HI> not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers in the Day that I took them by the Hand to bring them out of the Land of <HI>Egypt</HI> (which my Covenant they brake, although I was an Husband unto them, &s;aith the Lord) But this &s;hall be the Covenant that I will make with the Hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;|rael,</HI> after tho&s;e Days, &s;aith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts, and will be their God, and they &s;hall be my People.

<P>The&s;e and the like precious Promi&s;es I was made willing to take hold upon, and waited for the fulfilling of them in

<P>When I came to know a little of the Teachings of the Lord, I took my Leave of all my formal Teachers, and many Times went to the Woods, and other By-places, where none might &s;ee me, to wait upon the Lord, where I &s;hould be much broken, and tendered by the Power of God: And though I did begin to &s;ee a little of my&s;elf, and &s;omething of the Goodne&s;s of God, yet &s;till I was afraid of being deceived; for I had read and heard that Satan him&s;elf is "transformed into an Angel of Light, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi. 14. And le&s;t this Man &s;hould be as the &s;ame Apo&s;tle &s;aid, in Ver&s;e 13. <Q>For &s;uch are fal&s;e Apo|&s;tles,

Then I que|ried of him their Way of Wor&s;hip, and concerning tho&s;e two great Ordinances (&s;o called) that we &s;o much relied up|on, <HI>viz.</HI> the Bread and Wine, and Bap|ti&s;m and the Scripture, to know what was their Judgment of them, to which he gave me &s;ome Satisfaction: And in the Morning I parted with him, and to the be&s;t of my Knowledge, I &s;aw him no more for &s;everal Years.</P>
<P>In all this Time I &s;till kept my Retire|ment in the Wood, or &s;ome other pri|vate Place; and there in my waiting, I de&s;ired of the Lord, that I might be further &s;atisfied by my&s;elf, as to tho&s;e Things, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> whether the Scriptures were the Word of God, as was &s;aid and preached unto us they were, and the Way to Life and Salvation: Then the Fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>John</HI> came under my

By this we may &s;ee the Word of God is Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that was with the Father before the World began, "without Him there was not any Thing made, that was made."

<P>I had much Rea&s;oning and various Con&s;ultations in my Mind concerning this and the Bread and Wine: And when I was &s;atisfied, as to them weighty Concerns, I thought I might re&s;t there, and keep my old Cu&s;toms and Fa&s;hions, and Language: But that would not do, I had no Peace therein; God &s;hewed me the Cu&s;toms of the Nation were vain, and our Language not according to the Language of God's People, recorded in the Scriptures of Truth. So I made a con&s;ciencious Search into this Matter al&s;o.&mdash;Where I found the Great Creator of Heaven and Earth, who by the Word of his Power made all Things therein; <HI>Created Man in his own Image, in the I|mage of God created he him: Male and Female created he them. And God ble&s;|&s;ed them, and gave them Dominion over all Things that he had created on the Earth: and Adam gave Names to them. And God took him, and put him in the
<PB N="21" REF="006833_0021_102A5F32A5B7C6E8">Garden of Eden, to dre&s;s it, and to keep it. And the Lord commanded the Man, &s;aying, Of every Tree of the Garden thou may'&s;t freely eat,</HI> Gen. ii. 15, 16. This is the fir&s;t <HI>Thou</HI> to Man, that I read of in the Scripture; and the Great Creator &s;aid, "Every Thing that he had made was very good," <HI>Gen.</HI> i. 31. And his, Language to Man was very good and pure. Then again, when <HI>Adam</HI> tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed the Law and Commandment of God, <Q>The Lord God called unto <HI>Adam,</HI> and &s;aid unto him, Where art thou? And he &s;aid, I heard thy Voice in the Garden, and I was afraid, becau&s;e I was naked,</Q> <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 9, 10. Here was the Language of God to Man, and the Language of Man to God. And in the Searching of the Scriptures, I found that all the holy Men of God u&s;ed that Lan|guage, and Chri&s;t taught his Di&s;ciples to pray in that Language; <Q>Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy Name, thy Kingdom come, thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven,</Q> <HI>Matt.</HI> vi. And withal, I knew a little of Grammar, and that it was impro|per to &s;ay <HI>Vos [You]</HI> to one &s;ingle Per&s;on, in&s;tead of <HI>Tu [Thou.]</HI> And though the Learned in our Nation &s;poke it, yet I

<P>Thus I was con&s;cienciou&s;ly concern'd to &s;peak the pure Language of Thee and Thou to every one, without Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons; which was a great Cro&s;s to me, though it &s;eems to &s;ome but as a weak and fooli&s;h Thing; yet when the Lord lays a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peaking the Truth to all, in that Language that God and all his Servants u&s;ed, it comes to be of a great|er Weight, than many light airy People think it is: The Sayings of Chri&s;t came

<P>The next publick Service that the Lord required of me, was to go and give my Te&s;timony for Him, and to warn a Company of People to think of their lat|ter End, who were met to dance and to play, at what they call a Merry-night, not far from my Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e; and when I came within the Room where they were Dancing, the Fidler cea&s;ed Playing and they Dancing; I declared the Word of the Lord among them; and that which was chiefly before me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that of <HI>Job, They &s;end forth their lit|tle Ones like a Flock, and their Children dance.

<P>About this Time [1658.] I heard of One that was called a <HI>Quaker,</HI> that was
<PB N="38" REF="006833_0030_102A5F4939690198">come from <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>Llanvilling,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Town in this County of <HI>Momtgomery,</HI> and in the Love of God, I went upon the Fir&s;t Day of the Week to vi&s;it him, where we had a comfortable, refre&s;hing Meeting together, and the Lord's Pre|&s;ence was with us, tho' we were Stran|gers one to another, as to the outward, yet we had Fellow&s;hip and Union one with another in the inward Life of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; his Name was <HI>Roger Prichard.</HI> He tarried not long there but went back again to <HI>Ireland;</HI> tho' it it was &s;aid, that he came to the&s;e Parts with an Intention to &s;tay here, and to bear his Te&s;timony for God, in this dark Corner of <HI>North-Wales;</HI> but he not being faithful to God, who &s;ent him here, as he was going back he &s;u&s;|fered great Lo&s;&s;es by Sea, and lo&s;t his good Condition al&s;o, and turned back to the Vanities of the World, which was a great Sorrow and Exerci&s;e to me: But the Lord vi&s;ited him again, as may be &s;een hereafter. Thus I was left a|lone again.</P>
<P>I continued, as the Lord made Way for me, to vi&s;it tho&s;e in whom I found any Inclination to the Things that were good: And there was one <HI>William Da|vies</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="006833_0030_102A5F4939690198">convinced of the Truth with me? And I was al&s;o made willing to vi&s;it the <HI>Independent</HI> Meeting, and tho&s;e People that I formerly belonged unto, that were a &s;eparate People, gathered toge|ther chiefly by <HI>Vava&s;or Powell</HI> before|mentioned, a zealous Man in his Day and Time. But when Truth broke for the in this Country, I being the fir&s;t that came to receive it in the&s;e Parts, did &s;e|parate my&s;elf from them, in Love to that ble&s;&s;ed Truth that I received, and it became my true Teacher. So the &s;aid <HI>Vava&s;or Powell</HI> proved angry, and preached much again&s;t the <HI>Quakers,</HI> their Way and Principles. I hearing this, came at a certain Time to a Place called <HI>Cloddiecochion,</HI> near <HI>Welch-Pool,</HI> to their Meeting, expecting to find him there, but he was not there; but one <HI>John Griffithes</HI> (called a Ju&s;tice of the Peace) was Preach|ing there. When I came in among them, they &s;eemed unea&s;y; and when I had an Opportunity, I bore a Te&s;timony for God, and his Son Chri&s;t Je&s;us, his Way, Truth and People, which they preached again&s;t. When I had done what I had to &s;ay, he went on again; and when I found &s;omething more on my Spirit to declare among them, this <HI>John
<PB N="40" REF="006833_0031_102A5F4AEF61CA90">Griffithes</HI> commanded to take me away; and a near Relation of mine that owned the Hou&s;e, took me in his Arms and led me out of the Hou&s;e, through the Fold, and through a Gate that opened to the Common, and &s;hut the Gate after me; and there I &s;at under an A&s;h Tree, weep|ing and mourning &s;orrowfully, to &s;ee their Blindne&s;s, Darkne&s;s, and Hardne&s;s of Heart, with Pride and Haughtine&s;s, that was come over a People that once were loving, kind, and humble in Spi|rit. And as I &s;at weightily under a &s;e|rious Con&s;ideration what and when would be the End of all the&s;e Formali|ties and Hardne&s;s of Heart, I prayed to the Lord for them: And the Word of the Lord came to me, "That tho' they put me out of their Hou&s;e, yet in Time they would come to own Truth, and that Hou&s;e &s;hould be a Meeting-place for Friends: Of this a further Account may be &s;een hereafter. So I went away well &s;atisfied with the Love and Goodne&s;s of God to me that Day, in giving me Com|fort and Con&s;olation for my Tears of Sorrow and Affliction that I met with a little before; and I rememb'red the Say|ing of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 11. <HI>Now no Chast'ning for the pre&s;ent &s;eemeth joy|ous,
<PB N="41" REF="006833_0031_102A5F4AEF61CA90">but grievous: Neverthele&s;s, after|ward it yieldech the peaceable Fruit of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, unto them which are ex|erci&s;ed thereby.</HI></P>
<P>After this I &s;till waited to know the Will and Coun&s;el of God, and that he might direct me in my Way, and order my Steps in this my &s;piritual Travel; for I had none to look unto, but to Him a|lone, who was All-&s;ufficient to carry on the Work which he had begun, tho often by weak, poor, mean and con|temptible In&s;truments in the Eyes of the World. Well might I &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle, <HI>But God hath cho&s;en the fool|i&s;h Things of the World, to confound the wi&s;e; and God hath cho&s;en the weak Things of the World, to confound the Things which are mighty; and ba&s;e Things of the World, and Things which are de&s;pi&s;ed, hath God cho&s;en, yea, and Things which are not, to bring to nought Things that are,</HI> 1 Cor. i. 27, 28.</P>
<P>About this Time I went to vi&s;it &s;ome young Men that had been my former Companions in Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion; Two or Three of them were convinced, and received the Truth. So then, when we were come to the Number of Four, it was with me that we ought to meet
<PB N="42" REF="006833_0032_102A5F50CB2F8298">together, in the Name of the Lord; for I remembered the Promi&s;e of Chri&s;t; who &s;aid, <HI>Where Two or Three are ga|thered together in my Name, there am I in the Mid&s;t of them,</HI> Mat. xviii. 20.</P>
<P>So we all agreed to meet together, but none of us had a Hou&s;e of his own to meet in; we determined therefore to meet upon a Hill in a Common, as near as we could for the Conveniency of each other, we living &s;ome Miles di&s;tant one from another. And there we met in Si|lence, to the Wonder of the Country; when the Rain and Weather did beat up|on us on one Side of the Hill, we went to the other Side; we were not free to go into any Neighbour's Inclo&s;ures, for they were &s;o blind, &s;o dark and ignorant, that they look'd upon us as Witches, and would go away from us, &s;ome cro&s;&s;ing them&s;elves with their Hands, about their Foreheads and Faces.</P>
<P>And thus we continued for &s;ome Time, when Two of them left me; one of them was put an Apprentice by Friends to <HI>W. Shewen,</HI> of <HI>London;</HI> the other young Man was a Soldier in <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI>'s Days, and he got as &s;oon as he could to be di&s;banded, &s;o he went to <HI>Glouce|&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> and lived among Friends; the
<PB N="43" REF="006833_0032_102A5F50CB2F8298">other was one <HI>William D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies,</HI> that liv|ed hard by me, and we both met toge|ther for &s;ome Time; but at one Time he &s;tay'd longer than u&s;ual, and a foul, dark Spirit po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him, in&s;omuch that the little. Time we were together, was not comfortable to me; and when we had broke up the Meeting, by Way of Di&s;|cour&s;e he a&s;ked me, How I did think we &s;hould &s;tand in the Face of the whole Country? I an&s;wered him with great Zeal, The Serpent, the Serpent, the &s;ame that beguiled the Woman in Para|dice, hath beguiled thee, thou wilt not be able to &s;tand: And while we were yet di&s;cour&s;ing, I &s;aw my Ma&s;ter com|ing, who was al&s;o convinced, but was not faithful to that good Spirit that con|vinced him of the Truth, and &s;hewed him what he ought to do, but did it not (yet he continued loving to Friends, and frequented their Meetings to his latter End) as I looked back I &s;aw him come towards us, with two Women follow|ing him, the one was his Wife, my cru|el Mi&s;tre&s;s, the other was his Si&s;ter, they both had Staves in their Hands, and when they came unto us, the Si&s;ter began to beat her Brother, my Ma&s;ter, and my Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;et a beating of <HI>W. Da|vies;</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="006833_0033_102A5F5257D3D2B0">&s;o his Trial came very quickly, and <HI>W. Davies</HI> came no more to meet with me, nor any other Friends for ma|ny Years; yet he afterwards came a|mong Friends, and continued with them to the End of his Days, and was buried among them. Now it &s;o happened that I had never a Blow among them, and if I had received any, I had learnt of Chri&s;t Je&s;us my Lord and Ma&s;ter to &s;uffer pa|tiently for his Name's Sake, and not to depart from him though my Trials, Temptations and Afflictions were not a few; &s;o that I might &s;ay with the Apo|&s;tle, <HI>But none of tho&s;e Things move me, neither count I my Life dear unto my&s;elf, &s;o that I might fini&s;h my Cour&s;e with Joy;</HI> Acts xx. 24.2 Cor. iv. 17. Mat. x. 37.38, 39.</P>
<P>The&s;e young Men going away thus, I was left alone again, but &s;till I kept waiting upon the Lord, to know his Will and good Plea&s;ure concerning me, and when the Time of my Apprenti&s;hip was over, I found Freedom to go to <HI>London,</HI> to vi&s;it Friends there, which was in the Year 1658-9. And finding many good and living Friends there, I &s;ettled to my Trade, being a Felt-maker, and very well &s;atisfied I was, that I
<PB N="45" REF="006833_0033_102A5F5257D3D2B0">could go to Meetings, and follow my Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and when any Thing would come to my Mind, of this my native Country, barren and uninhabited with Friends and Truth, I endeavoured to &s;hut it out, and to keep where I was, and I did what I could; but all my fair Pretences, and Rea&s;onings would not do, di&s;obedient to the Lord I was, and Trouble, and Sor|row, and Judgment from the Lord came upon me, for not obeying his Command, to go to my own Country, to &s;tand a Witne&s;s for him there; in this my Di&s;|obedience I continued, till I had lo&s;t his Pre&s;ence, and he &s;mote me with Trouble within, and Pain in my Bones, that I could not Work nor Labour; in this Time Friends of <HI>London</HI> were very kind, and careful of me, and would freely have admini&s;tered unto me, but I was not willing to accept of any Thing from them, &s;o long as I had of my own, my Pain of Body and Spirit increa&s;ed upon me, till at la&s;t I was forced to bow to the Will of the great God, that was too &s;trong for me, and rea&s;oning with him one Night, upon the Bed of my Sorrows, he &s;hewed me clearly, that I was to go to my own Country, and I was made willing to give up to go if he would be plea&s;ed
<PB N="46" REF="006833_0034_102A5F53FB84F810">to let me know his Will by the Token that he would remove my Pain; and al|&s;o I rea&s;oned with him thus, That I was alone, like a Pellican in the Wilderne&s;s or a Sparrow on a Hou&s;e Top. And the Lord &s;till commanded me to go, and that he would provide a Help-meet for me. And when I had made a Covenant with the Lord to go, immediately my Pain was removed, and I had Peace and Quietne&s;s of Mind and Spirit. And I aro&s;e next Morning, and went to my Work; and when tho&s;e tender Friends that had a Regard for me in my Sick|ne&s;s, came to &s;ee me that Morning, I was gone to Work, which was to their Admiration.</P>
<P>So the Lord gave me a little Time and he alone provided a Help-meet for me, for I prayed unto him, that &s;he might be of his own providing, for it was not yet manife&s;t to me, where &s;he was, nor who &s;he was: But one Time as I was at <HI>Hor&s;ly-down</HI> Meeting, in <HI>Southwark,</HI> I heard a Woman Friend open her Mouth by Way of Te&s;timony, again&s;t an Evil ranting Spirit, that did oppo&s;e Feiends much in tho&s;e Days; it came to me from the Lord, that that Woman was to be my Wife, and to go with me to the
<PB N="47" REF="006833_0034_102A5F53FB84F810">Country, and to be a Help-meet for me; after Meeting, I drew &s;omewhat near to her, but I &s;poke nothing, nor made any Acquaintance with her, nor did I know when or where I &s;hould &s;ee her again. I was very willing to let the Lord order it as &s;eemed be&s;t to him&s;elf, and therein I was ea&s;y; and in Time the Lord bro't us acquainted one with another, and &s;he confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he had &s;ome Sight, of the &s;ame Thing, that I had &s;een concerning her; &s;o after &s;ome Time we parted, and I was freely re&s;igned to the Will of God; and when we came together again I told her if the Lord did order her to be my Wife, &s;he mu&s;t come with me to a &s;trange Country, where there were no Friends, but what God in Time might call and gather to Him&s;elf. Upon a little Con&s;i|deration &s;he &s;aid, If the Lord &s;hould or|der it &s;o &s;he mu&s;t go with her Husband, tho' it were to a Wilderne&s;s; and &s;he being &s;omewhat &s;en&s;ible of the Workings of God upon her Spirit, in this Matter, &s;he was willing to conde&s;cend in her Mind, to what God had wrought in her; but by hearkening to &s;ome Friend of hers, that had not well weighed the Matter, &s;he became di&s;obedient to what God had revealed to her; which bro't
<PB N="48" REF="006833_0035_102A3838AC3EDFB0">great Sorrow and Trouble upon her; and I went to &s;ee her in this poor Con|dition, and I re&s;ted &s;atisfied with the Will of God in this Concern, being free|ly re&s;igned, if the Lord had wrought the &s;ame Thing in her as was in me to receive her as the Gift of Almighty God to me; and after &s;ome Time, we waited upon the Lord together, the aro&s;e, and declared before me, and the other Friend that had begot Doubts and Rea&s;onings in her Mind, that in the Name and Power of God, &s;he con&s;ented to be my Wife, and to go along with me, whether the Lord &s;hould order us; and I &s;aid, In the Fear of the Lord I receive thee as the Gift of God to me. And &s;o I re&s;ted &s;atisfied in the Will of God, for a further Accompli&s;hment of it.</P>
<P>And being under a weighty Con&s;ide|ration, which Way to take each other in Marriage, we concluded to lay our Proceedings before our Elders, and e&s;pe|cially our ancient Friend <HI>George Fox</HI> (now People in tho&s;e Days were marri|ed by a Prie&s;t or before a Ju&s;tice) and I told <HI>G.

<P>God alone did know our Inno|cency and our Integrity in going toge|ther; it was not for Gold nor Silver, nor any outward Thing; but to be &s;er|viceable to him in our Age and Genera|tion, and to &s;tand Witne&s;&s;es for him, and his ble&s;&s;ed Truth, where the Lord &s;hould &s;end us.

<P>Soon after, in the Lord's Time, we made what ha&s;te we could, to come to the Country, where we believed the Lord would have us to be, and we &s;aid, O <HI>Lord, if thou wilt go with us in our Way, and give us Bread to eat, and Rai|ment to put on, then, O Lord, thou &s;halt be our God;</HI> and the Lord was with us, in all our Journey, and gave unto
<PB N="50" REF="006833_0036_102A5F55DA905E88">us, his &s;weet and comfortable Pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P>Soon after we came to <HI>Welch-Pool</HI> tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ors which had been and were in great Power, began to be faint|hearted, becau&s;e of the Report there was of bringing in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second; which in a little Time was accompli&s;hed, and tho&s;e that were in great Pomp, were bro't to Pri&s;on them&s;elves.

But the Lord was with me, and I feared not Man, who&s;e Breath is in his No|&s;trils, but the living God, whom I de|&s;ired to obey in all Things. And when I was come into the Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m (it being in the Night) the High-Sheriff one Col. <HI>Moy&s;tyn,</HI> with the Ju&s;tices of the Peace, &s;tood as People in a Maze, to &s;ee me come with my Hat on my Head among&s;t them, and they &s;poke not one Word to
<PB N="51" REF="006833_0036_102A5F55DA905E88">me for &s;ome Time. In a little while, I ask'd them, Whether they &s;ent for me there? And they &s;aid, They did.

That Ju&s;tice was peevi&s;h, and &s;aid, I think the Man is mad; I think we mu&s;t have him whipt; though I an&s;wered them according to Scripture, yet they were ignorant of it. They de|manded of me to take the Oath of Alle|giance and Supremacy: I told them, That my Lord and Ma&s;ter <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> and his Apo&s;tle <HI>James,</HI> commanded me, <HI>not to &s;wear at all.</HI> They had a Prie&s;t with them there, and he took upon him to que&s;tion me; the fir&s;t Thing he asked me was, which was fir&s;t, Rea&s;on or Scripture? I told him, That Rea&s;on was before Scrip|ture; <HI>God made Man a rea&s;onable Crea|ture, in his Own Image;</HI> and that the fir&s;t Part of the Scripiures, which we have now extant, was writ by <HI>Mo&s;es:</HI> The Apo&s;tle tells us, <HI>That the Law came by Mo&s;es, but Grace and Truth came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And I further told them,

And I asked whether he was not a Prie&s;t? They &s;aid, they looked upon him to be a fitter Man than them&s;elves to di&s;cour&s;e with me about Religion. I told them, I thought he was as the High-Prie&s;t among the <HI>Jews,</HI> who did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay en&s;naring Que&s;tions to Chri&s;t, when he was brought before them, to &s;eek to make him an Offender; and turning my|&s;elf to the Ju&s;tices, I de&s;ired them to take Notice of that Man, who laid tho&s;e en&s;naring Que&s;tions to &s;eek to make me an Offender.

Then the High-Sheriff (a very fair

<P>About the Third Month 1660, many of tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ors, both Captains, Lieu|tenants and Soldiers, that were in Arms in <HI>Oliver</HI> and <HI>Richard Cromwel</HI>'s Days were put in Pri&s;on in the Town of <HI>Montgomery:</HI> My Wife and I did fore|&s;ee, that I &s;hould be &s;ent there to them; though I never was a Soldier, nor bore any Arms for either Side. And in a lit|tle Time, there came a Troop of Hor&s;e
<PB N="55" REF="006833_0038_102A5F5AC64C55D0">for me, to take me to Pri&s;on: My Rela|tions offered to give Bail for me, but it would not be accepted of. So I went to acquaint my Wife of it, and to make my &s;elf ready to go with them: One of the Soldiers came up Stairs after me, with a Pi&s;tol and naked Sword; and my Wife ri&s;ing her &s;elf up, and &s;itting in Bed, (being delivered but three Days before of her fir&s;t Child) &s;he &s;aid, <HI>Dear hu&s;hand, be faithful to God, whatever becomes of me.</HI> The Soldier &s;eeing her, retreated back. So I went down to the Troop of Hor&s;e &s;tanding in the Street before my Hou&s;e: There was among them one bad Man (that run away in my Father's Debt) threat'ned to compel me to follow his Hor&s;e's Heels on Foot many Miles. But by this Time &s;everal of the Aldermen, and others of the Town were gathered together in the Street, who de&s;ired this Man, and others of the Troop, to let me alone for that Time, and they would engage Body for Body, that I &s;hould be in my Pri&s;on next Morning; but they could not prevail. At length &s;ome of the Aldermen fell into a Rage, and they bid them meddle with me if they dur&s;t; and bid me go to my Hou&s;e, which I was not willing to do; for
<PB N="56" REF="006833_0039_102A5F5E76BC8320">great Fear came upon me, le&s;t there &s;hould be a Quarrel among them con|cerning my going or &s;taying. But one or two of the Aldermen being more con|&s;iderate than the re&s;t, de&s;ired their Pati|ence till the Captain might be &s;poken with who was then in Town. He &s;oon granted that I &s;hould &s;tay at Home that Night, and be in <HI>Montgomery</HI> Pri|&s;on next Morning; and was angry at that bad Man, for his Incivility toward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Aldermen that interceded for me; for the Captain knew I was a peaceable Man, and never concerned my&s;elf in Fighting for one Side or other. And when the Troop had their Orders, they went on their Way; and I prai&s;ed God for the Multitude of his Mercies, in that there was no Blood&s;hed that Day: For many of the Young Men of the Town, with the Aldermen, were gathered to|gether with Clubs and Staves, &s;aying, What &s;hould a Town's born Child be &s;o abu&s;ed by &s;uch a bad Fellow as that was before-mentioned? My Heart often trembled within me, le&s;t any Thing &s;hould fall ami&s;s in this Tumult; and I de&s;ired them often, before they went to the Captain, that I might go along with them towards my Pri&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="006833_0039_102A5F5E76BC8320">
So, that Night I &s;taid at Home, and next Morning I took my Journey to|wards my Pri&s;on to <HI>Montgomery;</HI> and I avoided the Hou&s;e of my Uncle (that was a Ju&s;tice of the Peace in this Coun|try, near my Way, and a Brother-in-Law to this Captain) le&s;t he &s;hould &s;top me from going to Pri&s;on. So I went there my &s;elf alone, and told the Mar|&s;hal, one <HI>John Ma&s;on,</HI> that I was come a Pri&s;oner; and he took me up to an up|per Garret for my Lodging, but I had the Liberty of the Hou&s;e, as well as other Pri&s;oners; there being many of tho&s;e called <HI>Presbyterians, Independents,</HI> and <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> who were formerly my great Acquaintance; but now they appear|ed very &s;trange, and would not di&s;cour&s;e with me; But I con&s;idered the Rea&s;on, and was informed, that the&s;e old formal Church-Members or Profe&s;&s;ors had agreed among them&s;elves, that they would not di&s;cour&s;e with me, nor receive any Books from me, le&s;t the mo&s;t &s;erious inwad. Chri&s;tians among them (as they &s;aid) &s;hould turn <HI>Quakers.</HI> But in a little Time, their Orders and Covenants were broken, and I was moved to go to their Meeting, &s;ometimes, having little to &s;ay among them but a Sigh or a Groan, and
<PB N="58" REF="006833_0040_102A5F607A24DB70">a Travel in my Spirit for them, which did often put them out of Order in their Preaching and Praying; and as the Lord would order it, I &s;poke a few Words a|mong them. And a <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> was convin|ced there, and he came to meet with me in my Room. And there was one of the Profe&s;&s;ors, <HI>Cadwalader Edwards,</HI> al&s;o convinced, and he too came up with us to meet in the Pri&s;on: and then there came to be Di&s;cour&s;ings and Di&s;putes be|tween them and me. In this Time, I wrote a few Lines to &s;end Home to my Wife; but I knew not by whom to &s;end it, for it was very hard to &s;end any Papers out of Pri&s;on; the Mar&s;hal, or Goaler would examine and &s;earch &s;uch as came in, or went out, for Letters. There wa&s;san old Friend, an Acquaintance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that came to vi&s;it her Friends and Brethren, the Profe&s;&s;ors in Pri&s;on, whom I de&s;ired to carry that Letter to my Wife, as &s;he went through our Town of <HI>Welch-Pool</HI> to her Home; &s;he was fearful and afraid to meddle with it; partly for fear of the Goaler, and al&s;o le&s;t &s;he &s;hould offend her Brethren there. I de&s;ired her not to be afraid, for I would read it to her fir&s;t, and the Goaler might &s;ee it, if he plea&s;ed; and after I had read it to
<PB N="59" REF="006833_0040_102A5F607A24DB70">her, &s;he was tenderly affected, and turn|ed to her Brethren again, and &s;aid, Sure|ly the&s;e People will never come to us, but we mu&s;t go to them. In &s;ome Time after, thro' much Trouble and Afflicti|on, &s;he came to receive the Truth, to live in it, and obey it: Her Name is <HI>Margaret Bowen,</HI> Wife of <HI>John Bowen</HI> of <HI>Coll&s;ryn;</HI> and Mother to <HI>Peter Bowen,</HI> in <HI>Martin's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Grand, London;</HI> and &s;he is yet alive.</P>
<P>In a little Time my Service was over among tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ors in that Pri&s;on, and the Lord made Way for my Enlarge|ment, in about two Weeks Time, or a little more, I came away, and left the re&s;t of the Pri&s;oners there, where they continued afterwards for a con&s;iderable Time; I was well &s;atisfied with the Goodne&s;s of God, that I found his Pre|&s;ence, Life and Power with me, and a pre&s;ent Help in the Time of Need, that kept me low and humble, that I dur&s;t not rejoice that Spirits were made &s;ub|ject; but rather that I found my Name written in Heaven: So I came Home in great Love and Peace to my Wife and Family, and many of my loving Neighbours rejoiced to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>I continued about my Calling and Bu|neis, and waited upon God to know his
<PB N="60" REF="006833_0041_102A5F63582EB068">Mind and Will concerning me. In this Time I heard of an hone&s;t old Woman, who had received the Truth &s;ome Time before, about <HI>Montgomery,</HI> her Name was <HI>Anne Hamon,</HI> Wife of <HI>Thomas Ha|mon;</HI> my Wife and I went to vi&s;it her. Soon after, about the Year 1651. I went to a Meeting, at a Place called <HI>Edge|ment,</HI> near <HI>Wem</HI> in <HI>Shrop&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>Here our Friend <HI>William Gib&s;on</HI> and I were taken Pri&s;oners, with about 25 or 26 more, and &s;ent to <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> When we were brought there, we &s;aw the Temper of the Jaylor to be very cruel, and he threat'ned us, with a great deal of Hard&s;hip, if we did not eat of his Meat, and drink of his Drink, and lie on his Beds, and give him what he de|manded; we told him, we were the King's Pri&s;oners, and we demanded a free Pri&s;on, and Straw to lie upon, but he in a Rage denied us that, and put us in a little Room, where there was &s;carce Place for us to lie down; when Night <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame, Sleep came upon us, we being weary by travelling &s;o many Miles on Foot; but we were made willing and able to &s;uffer all Things; &s;o that Night we lay upon the Boards, and it was plea&s;ant unto us, being warm Weather, and about
<PB N="61" REF="006833_0041_102A5F63582EB068">the Time of Hay-Harve&s;t; the next Morning we were very fre&s;h and well, prai&s;ing God for his Mercies and Good|ne&s;s to us; the Jaylor came to us, and ask'd us how we did like our Lodging, and how we &s;lept? We told him, we &s;lept in Peace of Con&s;cience, and Qui|etne&s;s of Mind, for we &s;uffered for Con|&s;cience &s;ake towards God, and dur&s;t not break the Command of Chri&s;t and His Apo&s;tle, who commanded us not to &s;wear at all. For our &s;uppo&s;ed Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, was not only for meeting toge|ther, but for refu&s;ing the Oaths of Al|legiance and Supremacy. The Jaylor being a very pa&s;&s;ionate incon&s;iderate Man, he would go out in the Morning from his own Hou&s;e, and not come back till Night, and then returned &s;o drunk, that be could hardly &s;peak or &s;tand. The next Night when we went to lie down, the Room was &s;o little, we could not all lie at once; the next Morning we complained to the Jaylor, that there was not enough of Room for us all to lie down, and de&s;ired him to let us have a little Straw, but it would not be grant|ed us. By this Time the Friends of the Town had Liberty to come to vi&s;it us, and to bring us in &s;ome Provi&s;ion; and
<PB N="62" REF="006833_0042_102A5F66CCD8BA10">when the Door was opened for us to go into another Room, there being a corded Bed&s;tead it that Room, <HI>William Gib&s;on</HI> and I lay upon the Cords, and next Morning we found that the Print of the Cords was not only in our Clothes, but in our Skin al&s;o, &s;o that it would have been ea&s;ier for us to have lain upon the Boards as we did before. By this Time having well ob&s;erved the Jaylor's Hu|mour and Temper, I began to be unea&s;y in my&s;elf to let him alone; &s;o I watched him in the Morning upon his fir&s;t ri|&s;ing, when he would come to the Court that was before our Pri&s;on Door, and I began to di&s;cour&s;e with him about the Pri&s;oners that lay in &s;uch Hard&s;hip, I told him they were hone&s;t Men, and mo&s;t of them Ma&s;ters of Families, and they had good Beds to lie upon at Home, but now they were content for Chri&s;t's and the Go&s;pel's Sake, to &s;uffer that Hard&s;hip, and de&s;ired him to let them have their Liberty to go to their Friends in Town at Night, and to come there in the Morning, and if he would not be plea&s;ed to grant them a little Straw, then to let them go lie in their own Beds; which he &s;urlily deny'd, calling them a Company of Rogues and Knaves,
<PB N="63" REF="006833_0042_102A5F66CCD8BA10">and &s;uch like Terms. He asked me, What made me to plead for them? I told him, they were my Friends; he an&s;wered, Why your Friends? You are no <HI>Quaker,</HI> are you? I &s;aid, I am call'd a <HI>Quaker.</HI> He an&s;wered, You do not look like a <HI>Quaker:</HI> And he looked me in my Face, and on my Hands and Body. I de&s;ired him not to di&s;grace me &s;o, as to tell me I was no <HI>Quaker;</HI> then he asked me where I lived? I told him, when I was at Home, I lived at <HI>Welch-Pool,</HI> and my Family was there: But, &s;aid he, where are you now? I asked him, whether he did not know I was a Pri&s;oner there with my Friends? And he asked me, whether I did lie upon the Boards with them? I told him, I did: He &s;aid he was &s;orry for it; but went away in Anger, being much di&s;content|ed in him&s;elf. So I did not &s;ee him till next Morning, at which Time I went to him again, and I friendly di&s;cour&s;ed with him; he &s;aid, he did enquire a|bout me in the Town, and he &s;aid: might take the Liberty of the Town; I did acknowledge his Kindne&s;s; but I told him, it would be no Comfort to me to have the Liberty of the Town, and leave my Friends and Brethren there,
<PB N="64" REF="006833_0043_102A5F6984088050">he &s;aid, then I might &s;tay there with them: So I did not &s;ee him till the next Morning, and then I went to him again; he was &s;o cro&s;s and ill-conditi|oned, he would not &s;uffer any other Friend to &s;peak to him. <HI>William Gib&s;on</HI> did &s;o judge him for his Wickedne&s;s, that he kept him clo&s;e in a Room by him|&s;elf. After five or &s;ix Nights lying on the Boards, I prevailed with him, that Friends might have the Liberty of the Town in the Night, and be there in the Morning: So the next Day he began to be more friendly to us. After &s;ome Days, I de&s;ired our Friend <HI>John Milling|ton</HI> to come with me to the Jaylor's Hou&s;e, to &s;ee whether we could have Leave to go Home till the A&s;&s;izes; but then it was not granted: But he told me, if I plea&s;ed I might go Home till then; I told him, he might as freely let them go as me, for mo&s;t of them liv|ed in the County, and I lived out of the County; but no more could we have that Time of him: But I was unea&s;y in my&s;elf (&s;eeing I had got a Place in him) to let him alone, but &s;till I pre&s;&s;ed for my Friends further Liberty: In a little Time afterwards, I prevailed with him by &s;erious Arguments, as it was Har|ve&s;t-time,
<PB N="65" REF="006833_0043_102A5F6984088050">and it was hard for their Wives, or &s;ome of their Families, to come with weekly Nece&s;&s;aries for them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, with my Friend <HI>John Millington,</HI> prevailed with him to let them go, and he took our Words for our Appearance at the next A&s;&s;izes.</P>
<P>Through the Goodne&s;s of God, we all came together to <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> to our Pri&s;on before the A&s;&s;izes; and when we came there, we found a great Alteration in the Jaylor, he was very low and mournful, he had lo&s;t a Pri&s;oner, a Ma|lefactor, and was to be tried for his Life for his E&s;cape; he was very loving and kind to us, and let Friends go them&s;elves to <HI>Bridgenorth,</HI> about 14 Miles, where the A&s;&s;izes were then held, and he de&s;ired me to &s;tay with him in his Affliction; and not be much from him; he &s;aid his Life was at Stake, and if God and the Judge would &s;hew him any Mercy, it was upon our Friends Account, and not for any De&s;erts that were in him&s;elf, for he confe&s;&s;ed he had been too &s;evere to us; but, notwith&s;tanding, &s;aid he, you are merciful Men, and can forgive Wrongs and Injuries.</P>
<P>Then, when we came to <HI>Bridgenorth,</HI> we were put in a large &s;pacious room in
<PB N="66" REF="006833_0044_102A5F6BB0B807D8">the Hou&s;e of Correction, to be there in the Day-time, that we might be all together, and ready when called for; but we had liberty of going in and out for Lodging, and what Nece&s;&s;aries we wanted: No Keeper being over us, but what we &s;et our &s;elves to look to the Door, and that too many Friends might not be out at once, and tho&s;e were not to &s;tay out too long; and we &s;aw it con|venient, that Friends &s;hould go out by two and two, to walk the Streets; for it was a &s;trange Thing to People to hear of <HI>Quakers.</HI> Once it fell to my Lot to be at the Door, (tho' the Door was al|ways open, that &s;uch as would might come and &s;ee us; with &s;everal of them we had Rea&s;onings and Di&s;putes about the Way of Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s.) There came one, who appeared &s;ome|thing like a Gentleman, and asked me, Whether he might &s;ee the <HI>Quakers?</HI> I de&s;ired him to walk up along with me, and he &s;hould &s;ee them. And when I had brought him up to the Room where Friends were walking, I told him, Tho&s;e were they. He an&s;wered, The&s;e be Chri&s;tians, like our&s;elves; but when are the <HI>Quakers?</HI> I told him, The&s;e were they that were called <HI>Quakers.</HI>

Some People were &s;o blind and dark in tho&s;e Days, as to look upon us to be &s;ome &s;trange Creatures, and not like other Men and Women. They would gather much about us in the Town, and we had good Opportunities to &s;peak of the Things of God to 'em. But I was pretty much with the Goaler, waiting when his Trial could be: And when it came, I went with him, and &s;tood &s;ome|what near him, which he was very glad of. The Jury cleared him, being not found guilty of a wilful E&s;cape; which was Gladne&s;s to him, and Satisfaction to us.

<P>In the Year 1662, a further Concern came upon me about Meetings in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Country.

And in this Time I went to know, whether he would perform his Promi&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, which he readily granted; and I appoint|ed the Day and Time with him, which he gave Notice of to his Neighbours thereabouts. I being de&s;titute of a Friend to go with me to the &s;aid Meeting, de|pended upon the Lord, that he would provide a &s;uitable Companion to go with me. And my Wife going to <HI>Shrewsbury&punc;</HI> I told her of the Meeting, and de&s;ired her to &s;peak to Friends there of it; and
<PB N="69" REF="006833_0045_102A5F6DB0AC1928">if there was any Publick Friend there, that he might come along with her.

A Day or two after we went to the Meeting, where there came in <HI>Charles Lloyd</HI> of <HI>Dolobran,</HI> who was formerly in Commi&s;&s;ion of the Peace, and had been in Election to be High-Sheriff of that County, and &s;everal of his well-meaning Neighbours, &s;ome of them were Profe&s;&s;ors, belonging to the &s;ame People that I formerly belonged unto. The Lord was not wanting, but afforded unto us his good Pre&s;ence; Life and Power came from Him, that reached to the Hearts and Under&s;tanding of mo&s;t of the People then pre&s;ent, who gave Te&s;timony to the Truth, Life and Power of God, that appeared with us that Time; and in the Love, Fear, and Life of Truth we parted.</P>
<P>The next Morning we went to vi&s;it <HI>Charles Lloy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> of <HI>Dalobran</HI> afore&s;aid, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tly received us, and &s;everal of tho&s;e People that were at the Meeting came there that Day; where we had a &s;weet, comfortable, refre&s;hing Time, in

<P>The Sound and Report of this Meet|ing went through the Country, &s;ome &s;aying, that mo&s;t of that Side the Coun|try were turned <HI>Quakers.</HI> Whereupon divers were &s;ent for before <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Herbert,</HI> Baron of <HI>Cherbury,</HI> to a Place where he then lived, called <HI>Lly&s;&s;in,</HI> about three Miles from <HI>Dolobran;</HI> after &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with them, he &s;ent them to <HI>Welch-Pool</HI> to Pri&s;on, for refu&s;ing to take the Oath of Allegiance and Supre|macy, which they refu&s;ed, becau&s;e they could not &s;wear at all; they being about Six &s;ent together, <HI>viz.

<P>In a little Time there were added Pri|&s;oners to them, <HI>William Lewis</HI> and <HI>Mat|garet</HI> his Wife, who were Owners of the &s;aid Hou&s;e of <HI>Cloddiecochion</HI> before men|tioned, where I was moved to go about the Year 1657, to a Meeting there of the Profe&s;&s;ors (which is now the Place of my abode.)

<P>A little Time after this I went to <HI>Pen|lyn,</HI> near <HI>Bala;</HI> in <HI>Merioneth&s;hire,</HI> to vi&s;it &s;ome Friends and tender Profe&s;&s;ors there, who received me kindly; and there I &s;ettled a Meeting among them, in the Power of God; and from thence I came Home, where I &s;taid but a little while to vi&s;it the&s;e Pri&s;oners.

After this Journey, the Lord brought me &s;afe Home to my Wife and Family, to the Comfort of my Friends, and one another in the Lord.</P>
<P>Not long after this <HI>Thomas Lloyd,</HI> Brother to the &s;aid <HI>Charles Lloyd</HI> of <HI>Do|lobran,</HI> hearing that his Brother was in Pri&s;on, came from <HI>Oxford</HI> to vi&s;it him, having been a Student there for &s;eve|ral Years (as al&s;o his Brother <HI>Charles</HI> had been before him) they told me, that the great Sufferings of Friends in that City of <HI>Oxford,</HI> by the Magi&s;trates, and by the wild and ungodly Scholars, did work much upon them; and they had &s;ome &s;ecret Love for Friends then. So when <HI>Thomas Lloyd</HI> came Home; he being &s;ome Time with Friends in Pri&s;on, and el&s;ewhere; the Lord opened his Un|der&s;tanding by his Light, Life and

<P>The Jaylor of <HI>Welch-Pool,</HI> was very cruel to Friends, and continued them in that na&s;ty Hole before-mentioned, till one of the&s;e Friends, called <HI>Edward E|vans,</HI> before&s;aid, fell &s;ick (by Rea&s;on of the Dampne&s;s and Unhealthine&s;s of the Room) and died; and the Jaylor would not &s;uffer us to have his Body to be buried, except we would pay the Co|roner, and &s;o clear him, as if he had had no Hand in his Death; but at la&s;t his Relations prevailed, without a Coroner's laque&s;t; and they took him, and buried him on a Hill, on the Back-&s;ide of the Steeple-hou&s;e, in <HI>Welch-Pool,</HI> and it happened, as they were digging the Grave, they found &s;ome Bones of a Man, and upon Enquiry in &s;ome old Records, it was &s;aid there was an old Judge buri|ed there; and the Name of that Place is

<P>My Friend <HI>Thomas Lloyd</HI> and I were moved to go and vi&s;it mo&s;t of the Ju&s;tices, that had a Hand in Committing Friends to Pri&s;on, we began at the farthe&s;t Ju|&s;tice towards <HI>Machynlleth,</HI> and &s;o came down to <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Herbert</HI> Baron of <HI>Cherbury</HI> at <HI>Lly&s;&s;in</HI> afore&s;aid, who had committed <HI>Charles Lloyd,</HI> and &s;everal o|ther Friends; we under&s;tood on the Way that he was at a Bowling-Green, and &s;e|veral were with him, near a Place called the <HI>Can Office,</HI> near the High-Way Side, (and not far from <HI>Lly&s;&s;in;</HI>) where we beheld them Bowling, we con&s;idered with each other, which Way to take, there being a peevi&s;h Prie&s;t, the &s;aid

<P>A little after this, one <HI>Thomas Ellis</HI> (that was called a Deacon in the <HI>Inde|pendent</HI> Congregation) was convinced, a Man of great E&s;teem among them, and &s;o he was al&s;o afterwards among&s;t us.

<P>So the Magi&s;trates were re&s;olved to come and break up our Meeting, and one Fir&s;t-day they came, <HI>viz. Thomas Cor|bet,</HI> a Councellor, and a Ju&s;tice of Peace in this County; together with the two Bailiffs of the Town, the Serjeants at

Af|ter &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with them, they pro|po&s;ed to us, That if we would go to Church, and hear divine Service, as they call'd it, we &s;hould be di&s;charged. I told them, that when I was la&s;t there, they turned me out of their Church; and if I &s;hould make any Promi&s;e to go there, it might be that they would do the like to me again.

Ju&s;tice <HI>Corbet</HI> &s;eem'd to be &s;atisfied; but one of the Bailiffs &s;aid, Mr. <HI>Corbet,</HI> do you think that the old <HI>Quaker</HI> will go to Church, except it be to di&s;turb our Mini&s;ter? <HI>Corbet</HI> ask|ed me, whether I would di&s;turb the Mi|ni&s;ter? I told him, if God &s;hould put &s;omething in my Heart to &s;peak to the People, I hope they would not impo&s;e upon me to hold my Peace. He &s;aid, God forbid they &s;hould do &s;o! Then I told him, I hop'd I &s;hould perform what It promi&s;ed to do: And &s;o they di&s;char|ged us. Now none was under an En|gagement to go to the Steeple-hou&s;e but my&s;elf, and the Report went about, that the old <HI>Quaker</HI> would go to Church.</P>
<P>So when Fir&s;t-day came, and the Bells began to ring, the other two Friend's (viz. <HI>Thomas Lloyd</HI> and <HI>Samuel Lloyd</HI>) came to me, and &s;aid, we think we mu&s;t go with thee to the Steeple-hou&s;e, I took my Bible under my Arm, and went to Ju&s;tice <HI>Corbet</HI>'s Hou&s;e (that was but a few Doors from my Hou&s;e) to let him &s;ee that I was going; and I asked him, if he was going? He &s;aid, he was not di&s;po&s;ed to go that Day, but he would
<PB N="107" REF="006833_0064_102A5F95C2D6B328">&s;end his Man to &s;ee we were not affront|ed. So the two Friends and my&s;elf went to my own Pew, which was oppo&s;ite to the Pulpit; there was in the Pulpit only the Curate to read the Common-Prayer, and their Service to them that Morning: There was a great Multitude of People; it was &s;aid, there were &s;ome, that had not been at their Church for &s;e|veral Years before. So nothing was laid upon us to &s;peak to the People till he had done: Then I &s;tood up, and &s;aid to the People, <HI>I &s;uppo&s;e you are not igno|rant of the Cau&s;e of our coming here this Day, which was thus; The Magi&s;trates of the Town came to our Meeting, and they found us upon our Knees, praying to Almighty God; they were civil while we were at Prayer, and when we had done, they took our Names, and committed us Three to Pri&s;on, mo&s;t of the re&s;t that were at the Meeting were Pri&s;oners be|fore: The Magi&s;trates afterwards &s;ent for us, and told us, if we would come to Church, we &s;hould be di&s;charged; and now you &s;ee we are come, according to their De&s;ire: But I find that your Prie&s;t is not here, and now I would have you to inform him, that I &s;ay,</HI></P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>And that he is a true Minister of Chri&s;t;</HI></P>

<P N="4">4. <HI>And that your Wor&s;hip is not the true Wor&s;hip of God.</HI></P>
<P>All the People were very civil and orderly, and heard me a con&s;iderable Time in the Steeple hou&s;e; and when I had done, our Friend <HI>Thomas Lloyd</HI> &s;poke a few very &s;ea&s;onable Words to the People. And the People &s;aid, if Mr. <HI>Langford</HI> (which was the Prie&s;t's Name) will not prove us to be the true Church of Chri&s;t, and our Wor&s;hip to be the true Wor&s;hip, then we will pay him no more Tythes; for what <HI>Richard</HI>

<P>When the Bells rang again for them to go to their Evening Service, it lay up|on me to go there again, and the afore|&s;aid Friends went along with me; where the old High-prie&s;t was, who made a long Sermon, till we were all unea&s;y; but I de&s;ired the Friends to bear all Things patiently. When the Prie&s;t had done, he was going away; and I &s;tep'd up in my Seat, and de&s;ired him to &s;tay, for I had &s;omething to &s;ay to him; which was the &s;ame as afore&s;aid. When he heard my Queries, and what I had to &s;ay, he turned his Back, and went away, and gave us no An&s;wer. Then I &s;aid, <HI>Behold the Hireling fleeth, becau&s;e be is an Hireling;</HI> and &s;ome of the Peo|ple&s;taid, and &s;ome of 'em went with him, but all &s;eem'd di&s;&s;atisfied that he would not prove them to be the true Church of Chri&s;t, &amp;c. And I had a good Op|portunity to &s;peak to the People more at large in the Grave yard; the Lord's Pre&s;ence, Life and Power was with us, ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the Lord for e|ver,
<PB N="110" REF="006833_0066_102A5F9BEE9093F8">who doth not leave nor for&s;ake his People that tru&s;t in him.</P>
<P>When we came Home, Ju&s;tice <HI>Corbet</HI> &s;ent for us again to him; he met us in his Court, and &s;aid, he was &s;orry that Mr. <HI>Langford,</HI> was &s;o uncivil, that he did not an&s;wer our Queries, which he thought was very rea&s;onable that he &s;hould. And in a little Time many of the Neighbours were gathered together in the Street and in his Court; we had a good Opportunity to rea&s;on with him, and to open to the People, and to de|clare to them the Way and Means to ob|tain the Kingdom of Heaven; and he was &s;o moderate, that one of the Neigh|bours &s;aid to him, Mr. <HI>Corbet,</HI> we think you will be a <HI>Quaker</HI> too. His An&s;wer was, I wi&s;h I were a <HI>Quaker</HI> in my Life and Conver&s;ation. And towards the End of our Di&s;cour&s;e, he de&s;ired me to give him my Queries in Writing, that Mr. <HI>Langford</HI> might an&s;wer 'em; for &s;aid he, it may be he was not prepared to an&s;wer you then, but he may an&s;wer them in Writing. I told him, that was but a private Way of an&s;wering; but if he was rot prepared then, I told him, we would give him a Meeting next Fir&s;t|day at the Steeple h u&s;e, or in the
<PB N="111" REF="006833_0066_102A5F9BEE9093F8">Town-Hall upon a Market, Day, He &s;aid that was very fair.</P>
<P>This Coun&s;ellor <HI>Corbet</HI> was very friendly and loving to us, and did no more per&s;ecute us to his dying Day; but did us all the Good he could in all the Courts of Judicature, where he was con|cerned.</P>
<P>As for this Prie&s;t, <HI>William Langford,</HI> many Friends were moved to go to him to the Steeple-hou&s;e in the Time of his Service, to declare to him and the Peo|ple, what they had to &s;ay from the Lord; and when the Magi&s;trates have committed &s;ome of them to the Pri&s;on on that Account, this Prie&s;t, when his Ser|vice was over, hath got them to be re|lea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Some Time after this, he &s;ent the Clerk of the Pari&s;h to me for <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI>-reckonings; I asked the Clerk, whether his Ma&s;ter did expect any Thing of me that had nothing from him? and bid him tell his Ma&s;ter, I would come to reckon with him by and by; &s;o the Clerk went away, and in a little Time I made my&s;elf ready, and went to him; there were a pretty many People with him: I told him, that his Clerk had been with me from him, for that which
<PB N="112" REF="006833_0067_102A5F9DB2ED75D8">he call'd <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI>-reckonings, and I was come to reckon with him; and if he could make it appear that I owed him a|ny Thing, I would pay him, and I ex|pected the &s;ame from him. He &s;aid I owed him for &s;everal Years for the Sa|crament. I asked what he meaned by the Word <HI>Sacrament,</HI> for I found no &s;uch Word in the Scripture? He &s;aid it mean|ed the Bread and Wine which were u&s;ed in the Church. I told him I received none of him, and therefore not liable to pay. He an&s;wered again, Why, then you might come to Church, and receive it. I told him, I did not believe that his Church was the true Church of Chri&s;t; and I did not believe that he was a true Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, commi&s;&s;ionat|ed by Him to break the Bread, and give it to the People, and much le&s;s to &s;ell it, or take Money for it of the People; for I did not read in all the Scripture, that the true Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t did take any Money of the Peo|ple for that Bread they delivered unto them. He &s;aid then, That the Labour|er was worthy of his Hire; and under the Law it was &s;aid, <HI>Thou &s;halt not muz|zle the Mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the Corn.</HI> I told him, he trod out no
<PB N="113" REF="006833_0067_102A5F9DB2ED75D8">Corn for me; and tho' he was an Hire|ling, yet I never hired him.</P>
<P>The People coming thick to pay him for the Bread and Wine, I ask'd him how in Con&s;cience he could take &s;o much Mo|ney for &s;o little Bread and Wine? it being I &s;uppo&s;e about 10 <HI><ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI> for Man and Wife. I ask'd him, what Scripture he had for it? and de&s;ired him to prove his Practice by Scripture. He asked me, what Scripture I had to eat Flum|mery? I told him, I had Scripture to eat it; <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Timothy, For every Creature of God is good, and nothing to be refu&s;ed, if it be received with Thank&s;|giving: For it is &s;anctified by the Word of God and Prayer,</HI> 1 Tim. iv. 4, 5. His Communicants, who were pre&s;ent, were much di&s;&s;atisfied that he had no better An&s;wer and Proof for his Practice. I de&s;ired the People to take Notice, that he could not make it appear by Scripture, that I owed him any Thing: But I told them, that he owed me &s;ome Money, and I de&s;ired him to pay it me; which he did; and then we parted fairly. We have a Saying, <HI>That even or often Reckonings make long Friends.</HI> He was very friendly afterwards, and never &s;ent to me more for <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI>-reckonings.
<PB N="114" REF="006833_0068_102A5FA0F1C2D4A0">And as for the Tythe in Time of Har|ve&s;t, he charged his Servants to take from me no more than what was called their due, nor &s;o much: I was inform'd he &s;hould &s;ay, he knew not why he &s;hould take any Thing from me, &s;eeing I had nothing from him. He lived here among us many Years a good Neighbour; and though in the Time of great Per&s;ecution, yet he had no Hand in per&s;ecuting any of us.</P>
<P>We have Cau&s;e to ble&s;s the Lord, who carried us through all our Services and Exerci&s;es, in the Time of our Weakne&s;s; and though we were little and low in our own Eyes, the Lord did not leave us, nor for&s;ake us, ble&s;&s;ed be his holy Name for ever.</P>
<P>About the Year 1663, or 1604. I went to <HI>London,</HI> and I found &s;ome there &s;epa|rated from that Love and Unity, which I formerly &s;aw them in, joining in that Spirit with <HI>John Perrot,</HI> who was new|ly come from Pri&s;on at <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> as it was &s;aid, with much &s;eeming Hu|mility and Lowline&s;s of Mind; a con|&s;iderable Company joined together with him, where they had me among them for a little Time. The Tendency of that Spirit was to &s;peak Evil of Friends,
<PB N="115" REF="006833_0068_102A5FA0F1C2D4A0">that bore the Burthen and Heat of the Day, and to cry out again&s;t Friends, as dead and formal; and they expected a more glorious Di&s;pen&s;ation than had been yet among Friends; and they kept on their Hats in Time of Ptayer. I was but a little while among them, till a Vail of Darkne&s;s came over me; and under that Vail I came to have a light E&s;teem for my dear and ancient Friend <HI>G. F.</HI> and &s;ome others, who had been near and dear to me. But it plea&s;ed the Lord to rend the Vail of Darkne&s;s, and cau&s;e the Light of his Countenance to &s;hine again upon me; whereby I came to &s;ee the doleful Place I was led into, by a Spirit that tended to nothing but Self|exaltation, and (under a Pretence of Humility and Self-denial) the Breach of that Unity, Love and Fellow&s;hip, that formerly we had together; and the good E&s;teem we had one of another in the Lord; Children we were of one Fa|ther, e&s;teeming one another above our|&s;elves in the Lord; there was no Jar or Contention among us then, but all dwelt together in Love and Unity, and in the Fellow&s;hip of that ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel of Peace, Life and Salvation.</P>

At my Return Home from <HI>London,</HI> I was &s;oon taken to the &s;ame Pri&s;on with my Friends in <HI>Welch-Pool;</HI> and little before I came among them to Per|&s;on, the under Jaylor dreamed a Dream, how that he had in his Foldra Flock of Sheep, and that he was wre&s;tling to get <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in one Ram among the Sheep, but could not get him in; but when I came to Pri&s;on, he &s;aid to my Friend <HI>Charles Lloyd,</HI> Now I have got the old Ram in among the Sheep.

<P>This was a Time when mo&s;t travel|ing Friends were taken up Pri&s;oners; and though I was a Pri&s;oner, yet it lay upon me to get Liberty to go and vi&s;it Friends in &s;everal Counties of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales;</HI> &s;o I followed my good Guide, that &s;hewed me what to do; I went to the Jaylor, and told him, I had an Occa&s;ion to go out a little while, and I could not go without acquainting him of it, becau&s;e I was his Pri&s;oner; and he &s;aid, I warrant you will go to Preach

I told him, that if I was taken Pri&s;oner, I would &s;end to him where I was, and he might &s;end for me if he plea&s;ed, to he bid me have a care of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In a little Time in the Love of God, I took my leave here of my Friends and Family, and committed my&s;elf, to the Protection of the Almighty; I began my Journey, and went to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> where I had good Ser|vice for the Lord; &s;o I went to <HI>Tewkes|bury,</HI> where I never was before; an an|cient Woman Friend followed my Hor&s;e, and before I had put up at the Inn, &s;he was with me, and cordially &s;aid, &s;he had a Sen&s;e upon her, that I was one of her (Heavenly) Father's Children; &s;o when I went in, and had refre&s;hed me a little, I asked her, whether &s;he thought I might have a Meeting with Friends that Eve|ning; and &s;he readily &s;aid, She would ac|quaint Friends of it, and after &s;he had gone a little Way out of the Inn, &s;he re|returned again, and de&s;ired to know my Name, that &s;he might acquaint Friends of it; I was &s;treightened in my &s;elf, to give her my Name, tho' I knew not

<P>From thence I went thro' <HI>Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire,</HI> where I had good Meetings, and &s;o to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and when I was clear at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> the Lord having ble&s;&s;ed me, and pre&s;erved me &s;o far in my Journey; I &s;et forward towards <HI>Pembroke&s;hire,</HI> I travel|led without any Companion, but the Lord alone, who was with me all along in my Journey, he was my Helper and Pre&s;erver; &s;o I came to the Hou&s;e of our Friend <HI>Lewis Davies,</HI> who gladly recei|ved me in the Lord; I &s;taying there &s;ome Time, they lent me a Hor&s;e to go to a Meeting at <HI>Red&s;tone,</HI> and I left my own behind me, thinking he might re&s;t for &s;ome Days after my hard Riding.

<P>In 1668, this being read in one of our Monthly Meetings for Wor&s;hip, the Lord was plea&s;ed to afford us his &s;weet Pre&s;ence, and his Power melted, ten|dered and mollified our Hearts; which cau&s;ed us to prai&s;e the Lord, for his
<PB N="126" REF="006833_0074_102A5FB1A4EA0ED8">great Goodne&s;s and Mercy to us, in bringing us out of that Darkne&s;s which came over us by giving heed unto the &s;educing Spirit of <HI>John Perrot, John Whitehou&s;e,</HI> and this <HI>Cadw. Edwards.</HI> Friends were very careful afterwards of receiving any Spirit that might tend to the Breach of Love and Unity among us. Many other Friends brought in their. Te&s;timonies again&s;t that Spirit, among the re&s;t, there was one that came from our Friend <HI>Thomas Ellis,</HI> who had been particularly warned by me, in the Fear of the Lord, not to touch nor meddle with that Spirit (tho' it came with much &s;eeming Humility) le&s;t he &s;hould &s;uffer thereby, which he did, to his great Sor|row; and he &s;et out in his Paper, and &s;aid, <HI>This have I &s;uffered for my mungrel, Moderation:</HI> But ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, he was &s;weetly re&s;tored again to his for|mer Love and Integrity, to the great Comfort of him&s;elf, and his Brethren.</P>
<P>As to the&s;e Men, <HI>viz. John Perrot, John Whitehou&s;e,</HI> and the &s;aid
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He became afterwards very bad, and ungodly in his Life and Conver&s;ation, and died in the Fleet-Pri&s;on at LONDON, being there for Debt; yet near his End, he &s;eem'd to repent of his wicked Life, and told &s;ome, <Q>That they who were pre&s;erved faithful among the People called QUAKERS would be happy, and that they were the Peo|ple of God.</Q></NOTE> <HI>Cadw.
<PB N="127" REF="006833_0074_102A5FB1A4EA0ED8">Edwards,</HI> they turned their Backs upon God and his Truth, and followed the Devices of their own Hearts and Imagi|nations.</P>
<P>About this Time there being a Meet|ing of Friends gathered at <HI>Abery&s;twith</HI> in <HI>Cardigan&s;hire,</HI> mo&s;t of them were &s;ent to Pri&s;on to <HI>Cardigan</HI> Town, and our Friend <HI>Thomas Ellis</HI> was taken Pri&s;oner with them; and I having the Sufferings of the&s;e young-convinced Friends under Con&s;ideration, I found much Love in my Heart towards them, even &s;o as to go to the Magi&s;trates of the County to offer my&s;elf a Pri&s;oner in&s;tead of my Friend and Brother <HI>Thomas Ellis,</HI> and &s;ome others, that they might go Home to vi&s;it their Families. I acquainted my Wife of my Exerci&s;e, which came pret|ty clo&s;e to her; but, after &s;ome Con&s;i|deration, with much Tenderne&s;s, &s;he gave me up for that Service. In a few Days I took my Journey, and went fir&s;t to <HI>Thomas Ellis</HI>'s Hou&s;e to vi&s;it his Wife and Family, before I went further; his Hou&s;e being about 24 Miles from <HI>Welch-Phol,</HI> and not far off my Way to <HI>Cardi|gan&s;hire,</HI> and there I very unexpectedly met <HI>T. Ellis</HI> him&s;elf at Home; he told me they were all di&s;charged out of Pri|&s;on.
<PB N="128" REF="006833_0075_102A5FB36FCFFD80">And thus I &s;aw it was the good Will and Plea&s;ure of my heavenly Father to accept of my Free-will Offering in|&s;tead of the Deed; and my Friend <HI>T. Ellis</HI> and his Wife were &s;en&s;ible of my Love and Kindne&s;s to them therein.</P>
<P>And now my Service being further for <HI>Pembroke&s;hire, T. Ellis</HI> was willing to accompany me in my Journey; and we went to <HI>Abery&s;twith</HI> to vi&s;it tho&s;e Friends there, where we had a pretty large Meeting on Fir&s;t-day in the Morning; there came in one <HI>Thomas Price,</HI> Brother to Sir <HI>Richard Price</HI> of <HI>Gogord|dan,</HI> and took us all Pri&s;oners, and committed us to the Town-pri&s;on. That Evening we had a Meeting in the Hou&s;e where we were Pri&s;oners; many of the Town's People, and &s;ome of them Per|&s;ons of Account, were at the Meeting that Evening: I declared the Word of the Lord to them in <HI>Welch,</HI> and &s;hewed them the Way to the Kingdom of Hea|ven. And a &s;weet, comfortable Meet|ing we had, and great Satisfaction it was to them that were there.</P>
<P>That Night a weighty Con&s;ideration came upon me about the&s;e young con|vinced Friends, that were &s;o lately di&s;|charged of their Impri&s;onment, becau&s;e
<PB N="129" REF="006833_0075_102A5FB36FCFFD80">they were like to go &s;o quickly to Pri&s;on again. I asked Coun&s;el of the Lord what we might do for and in Be|half of tho&s;e young and tender Friends; and being under a great Exerci&s;e in my Spirit, and earne&s;tly praying to God, that he might make &s;ome Way for their Enlargement; it came in my Mind to write to the chief Magi&s;trate, Sir <HI>Ri|chard Price,</HI> and to give him an Account of my Journey &s;o far, and how that my Friend <HI>T. Ellis</HI> and my&s;elf intended for <HI>Pembroke&s;hire,</HI> and we re&s;ted with our Friends, and having a Meeting with them that Day, were taken Pri&s;oners by his Brother <HI>Thomas Price,</HI> and if it was his Plea&s;ure to &s;end us to Pri&s;on to <HI>Cardi|gan,</HI> he would be &s;o kind to leave his Neighbours at Home, and accept of my Friend <HI>T. Ellis</HI> and my&s;elf as Pri&s;oners in&s;tead of them all: To this Effect I wrote to him, and &s;ent it next Morning; but he &s;ent me no An&s;wer. But the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;table came to us, and told us, we mo&s;t all prepare to go to <HI>Cardigan</HI>-Town, where the County Goal was kept. So Friends freely and heartily prepared them&s;elves to go. And when the Time of our going was come, they tenderly taking their Leave of their Wives, Chil|dren
<PB N="130" REF="006833_0076_102A5FB6639F6A50">and Neighbours, (for &s;ome of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Neighbours came a little Way to &s;end them out of Town) the Con&s;table &s;topp'd; and bid all go Home except <HI>The. Ellis</HI> and <HI>Me:</HI> For it &s;eems the High Con&s;table had private Orders not go with them, but to do as I de&s;ired in my Letter. And thus the Lord did try tho&s;e tender Friends, and al&s;o delivered them.</P>
<P>The Con&s;table had In&s;tructions to bring us to the Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions, then held at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lanbedar,</HI> and not to <HI>Cardigan;</HI> when we came there, the Ju&s;tices being upon the Bonch, we were had before them, &s;ome of them were formerly acquainted with <HI>Tho. Ellis,</HI> he having been in Au|thority, (and according to his Place; &s;omewhat &s;harp again&s;t Offenders) the Ju&s;tices were very moderate to him; but the Clerk of the Peace was very peevi&s;h and froward. So I asked the Ju&s;tices. Whether that Man, that did que&s;tion my Friend, was a Ju&s;tice of the Peace? And they told me, he was not; then I told them, we were not bound to an&s;wer him. But, if they would give me Leave, I would give them a ju&s;t Account of my Bu&s;ine&s;s in that County, and upon what Account we were &s;ent there before them; and they de&s;ired me to &s;peak on.&mdash;I told them,
<PB N="131" REF="006833_0076_102A5FB6639F6A50">I was at my own Hou&s;e, with my Wife and Family, in <HI>Welch-Pool</HI> in <HI>Montgome|ry&s;hire,</HI> and hearing that my Friend <HI>Tho|mas Ellis,</HI> and other of my Friends, were in Pri&s;on in this County of <HI>Cardigan,</HI> for a con&s;iderable Time; it was with me to come to the Magi&s;trates of this County, to offer my&s;elf a Pri&s;oner, that my Friend <HI>T. Ellis,</HI> and the re&s;t of them, might go for a little Time to vi&s;it their Families; in order thereunto, I came as far as my Friend <HI>T. Ellis</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where I found him at Home with his Wife and Family: And they being di&s;charged of their Impri&s;onment, I had a further Concern upon me to go to <HI>Pembroke&s;hire,</HI> my Friend <HI>T. Ellis</HI> being not willing I &s;hould go alone, accompanied me along: So we came to <HI>Aberystwith,</HI> to re&s;t there the Fir&s;t Day of the Week, and had a Meeting with our Friends, and were ta|len Pri&s;oners, and &s;ent here to you, and now de&s;ire to know your Plea&s;ure. The Ju&s;tices an&s;wered, it was great Love in|deed, that cau&s;ed me to come and offer my&s;elf a Pri&s;oner upon &s;uch an Account, and they were &s;orry that Sir <HI>Richard Frice</HI> gave us that Trouble, as to &s;end us there: And &s;o they di&s;charged us. And the Court being &s;ilent, I had an Oppor|tunity
<PB N="132" REF="006833_0077_102A5FB90A291AD0">to declare the Word of the Lord among them. Very &s;till and attentive they were, as if I had been in a Meeting; I commended their great Moderation, and in the Love of God we parted with them. The Deputy-&s;heriff and the High-con&s;ta|ble that brought us there, came out of the Court, and treated us very civilly, and would have be&s;towed on us the be&s;t that the Town could afford, but we were &s;paring of taking any Thing of them. I was informed, that the Depu|ty Sheriff and High Con&s;table were con|vinced, and were very loving to Friends all along; and I know not of any that were impri&s;oned in that County after|wards. The Lord was with us, and he had a Regard to the Integrity of our Hearts, and he alone pleaded our Cau&s;e, and was with us in our Services.</P>
<P>Then we took Hor&s;e, and left the Town, and went on towards <HI>Pembroke|&s;hire,</HI> till we came to <HI>Cardigan,</HI> being about 24 Miles. We met with &s;ome Hard&s;hip on the Way, having little or no Refre&s;hment till we came here, where we had very good Entertainment for our&s;elves and Hor&s;es; and from thence we had a Friend for our Guide towards <HI>Ponchi&s;on</HI> in <HI>Pembroke&s;hire,</HI> but we were
<PB N="133" REF="006833_0077_102A5FB90A291AD0">benighted, and it rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and our Guide lo&s;t his Way, and we wandered up and down among the Peat, or Turf-pins, and other dangerous Places; but the Lord pre&s;erved us out of them all. And at length we came to <HI>Ponchi&s;on;</HI> but it being dark, we did not know the Hou&s;e where our Friend that we intended to go to lived, but I &s;poke to our Guide to &s;ee where their Steeple-hou&s;e Door was, and he brought us to it; then I told them, the Friend's Hou&s;e was oppo&s;ite to it: For I rememb'red when I had a Meeting there, my Back was again&s;t the Wall of the Hou&s;e, and my Face to|wards the Steeple-hou&s;e Door. So we went forward, and found the Hou&s;e; I de&s;ired T. E. to call and tell them, That there were &s;ome Friends that had lo&s;t their Way, and de&s;ired to have Lodg|ing there that Night; they, being in Bed, an&s;wered, they thought that no good Friend was out that Time of Night; T. E. rea&s;oned a little with them, but &s;till they were not willing to ri&s;e and let us in; at la&s;t I call'd to the Friend, who&s;e Name was <HI>Tho. Simmons,</HI> and to his Wife, and de&s;ired them to ri&s;e and let us come in; and he asked me, who was there? and I told him, in <HI>Welch, Richard Da|vies</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="006833_0078_102A5FBBB25C7C90">was there; what, &s;aid he, <HI>Richard Davies</HI> of <HI>Welch-pool&punc;</HI> I told them, I was the Man: Thereupon the tender, loving Friends ha&s;tily came down, and let us in to their Hou&s;e, and we were &s;atisfied in the Love of God. This be|ing the fir&s;t Journey that <HI>T. Ellis</HI> made to <HI>Pembroke&s;hire</HI> &s;ince he was convinced.</P>
<P>Hence we went to <HI>Haverford-we&s;t,</HI> and &s;o through all the Meetings in the County, till we returned to <HI>Ponchi&s;on;</HI> again, and had a Meeting there, where; there came many Friends, both <HI>Welch</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> &s;o that the Hou&s;e could not contain us, and we had the Meeting out of Doors in the Street, and I declared the Word of the Lord to them, both in <HI>Welch</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>As we came up to <HI>Pembroke&s;hire,</HI> we went to a <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and the Wo|man of the Hou&s;e being loving and ten|der, promi&s;ed we &s;hould have a Meeting among the <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> there. We al&s;o ap|pointed a Meeting at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> in <HI>Car|marthen&s;hire, Peregrine Mu&s;grave, James Lewis,</HI> and &s;everal other Friends accom|panied us to the Meeting at <HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> the Magi&s;trates of the Town were very civil, and &s;everal of them came to the Meeting, the Weight and Service of
<PB N="135" REF="006833_0078_102A5FBBB25C7C90">which lay chiefly upon me; for though my Friend and Companion T. E. was reckoned a Deacon, and an eminent Preacher among the <HI>Independents,</HI> yet, his Mouth was but very little opened as yet by Way of Te&s;timony among Friends, in was an under&s;tanding Man in the Things of God, and was not ha&s;ty to offer his Offering, till he found a very weighty Concern on him. And as I was declaring to the People in the <HI>Welch</HI> language, I &s;tood oppo&s;ite to a great Window that opened to the Street, and there was an evil-minded Man in the Street that had a long Fowling Piece, and he put the Mouth of it through the Window, and &s;wore, that if I would &s;peak another Word, I was a dead Man: But ble&s;&s;ed be God, I was kept in that which was above the Fear of Man, and the Lord kept me in Dominion over all. There were two Women &s;itting in the Window, and the Mouth of the Gun came between them both; one of them &s;eeing the Gun there, turned her Back upon it, and &s;aid in <HI>Welch,</HI> when the Man threat'ned as before, I will die my|&s;elf fir&s;t. And there was one in the Meeting went to this Man, and took the Gun away from him; and that bad,
<PB N="136" REF="006833_0079_102A5FBE64D33348">wicked Man came into the Meeting, and was pretty quiet there; the Lord's good Pre&s;ence was with us, a good Meeting we had, and I may &s;ay, That <HI>they that tru&s;t in the Lord are as Mount Sion, that cannot be removed.</HI> And it was &s;aid of old, <HI>As the Hills ware round about Jerus;alem, &s;o is the Lord round about this People, to be a pre&s;ent Help to them in every needful Time.</HI></P>
<P>Here <HI>Pembroke&s;hire</HI> Friends and we parted, and it being &s;omewhat late, the Meeting having held long, we travelled, all Night over &s;ome doleful Hills, in|tending to be at the <HI>Baptist</HI> Meeting next Day, which we had appointed, as be|fore mentioned, it was by Computation about 24 Miles. In this Time we had little Refre&s;hment for our&s;elves or Hor|&s;es: But when we came there, we had no Meeting; the Woman of the Hou&s;e &s;aid, That the Magi&s;trates had heard of it, and charged them, that we &s;hould not have a Meeting there: So the &s;lavi&s;h Fear of Man came over them: The Wo|man &s;eem'd to be &s;orrowful, and would have given us &s;ome Victuals; but I told her, we did not travel &s;o hard to come there for her Meat and Drink, but in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of God for the Good of their Souls.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="006833_0079_102A5FBE64D33348">
Here my Friend and Companion <HI>Tho|mas Ellis</HI> and I parted; he went Home|wards, and I went that Night to one <HI>Wil|liam ap Hugh</HI>'s Hou&s;e (a Poor Friend, who had a con&s;iderable Company of &s;mall Children) I lay on a little Straw upon a Hurdle of Rods. And when the Morn|ing appeared, I took a Bit of a Cake, and a Cup of clean Water, and <HI>William ap Hugh</HI> and I took our Journey towards <HI>Radnor&s;hire,</HI> which was about so Miles, mo&s;tly over great Hills; and when I came there, I &s;tayed a little while among Friends. And afterwards, I ha&s;t'ned Home to my Family; and when I was come there, <HI>Margaret Bowen,</HI> brought my lit|tle Girl to me, and &s;aid, here is a Child the Lord hath given thee; &s;he had been Sick near unto Death: Now when I was under my Exerci&s;e in '<HI>Pembroke&s;hire,</HI> one told me, my Child was dead, and my Wife not like to recover; which was Mat|ter of Sorrow to me; and I turned a lit|tle a&s;ide from Friends, and the Lord &s;a|tisfied me, that neither my Wife nor Child were dead. And when I came Home, they told me my Child had been as it were rai&s;ed from Death to Life: But ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, that re&s;tored

<P>After this Journey, I &s;tay'd a con&s;i|derable Time at Home, with my Family and Friends, our Meetings were pretty much &s;upplied with Travelling Friends, e&s;pecially from the <HI>North</HI> of <HI>England;</HI> and though we were Pri&s;oners, yet we had our Liberty to go to Meetings A|brond; we had a con&s;iderable large Meet|ing at <HI>Cloddiecochion,</HI> (the Place now of my abode) near <HI>Welch-Pool,</HI> there was at our Meeting, <HI>John ap John,</HI> and <HI>James Adam&s;on,</HI> a <HI>North</HI> Country Friend; but the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Pool</HI> (it being in the Eimits of their Corporation) came and broke up our Meeting, and took us Pri|&s;oners; we old Pri&s;oners went to our own Pri&s;on, <HI>i. e.</HI> the County Pri&s;on, and the re&s;t went to the Corporation Pri&s;on. I took my Friend <HI>John ap John</HI> by the Hand, and told him, he mu&s;t go to Pri|&s;on with me: So &s;everal of us went to|gether, and when the Hurry was over with them, they let us who were old Pri&s;oners; go to Pri&s;on alone; then I di&s;|charged our Friend <HI>John ap John,</HI> and I told him, he &s;hould be my Pri&s;oner no longer; he &s;tay'd a little while with us, and then went homewards. the Jaylor
<PB N="139" REF="006833_0080_102A5FC0610E3FF0">was friendly to us, and after a while; I went to the Magi&s;trates, and got them all relea&s;ed that Night, except <HI>James Adam&s;on.</HI> The Magi&s;trates of the Coun|ty gave &s;trict Charge, that if any <HI>North</HI> Country. <HI>Quakers</HI> came that Way they &s;hould be &s;ecured; and I had a great Care upon me, to get them di&s;charged, as &s;oon as might be; for I knew there was a great Concern upon them, to vi&s;it the Church|es of Chri&s;t, where&s;oever God &s;ent them: So when I faw a convenient Time, I went to the Serjeant of the Town, and asked him, by what Auhority he kept my Friend there a Pri&s;oner; and I asked him, whether he had a Commitment up|on him; and he told me, No: Then I de&s;ired him to let him come with me, and I would An&s;wer for him. So the Friend came to my Hou&s;e; and Friends and I concluded together to let him go to <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> which was about 12 Miles from <HI>Welch-Pools,</HI> and I de&s;ired him to &s;tay there till he &s;hould hear from me.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;izes being there a few Days af|ter; the chief Magi&s;trate of <HI>Pool</HI> went there, and I went there al&s;o. And as my Friend <HI>James Adam&s;on</HI> and I were walking under the Hall at <HI>Srewsbury</HI> we met the Magi&s;trate of <HI>Welch-Pool,</HI> to

For, &s;aid he, we &s;ent to the Lord <HI>Herbert</HI> of <HI>Cherbury,</HI> for a Com|mitment upon him; I told him, they had kept him too long without a Commit|ment, which they could not legally an&s;wer: Now he knew not that the Pri|&s;oner was with me; &s;o I asked him, af|ter &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e, what he would give me for a Sight of the Pri&s;oner; then he con&s;idered; and asked me, whether the Man that was with me was not his Pri&s;oner; I told him he was (for I knew that he was then out of his Liberty) &s;o he &s;aid to the Friend, Your Friend hath done you and me a Kindne&s;s; and I do &s;ee, that if there had been Occa&s;ion, you would have come again; &s;o he part|ed very friendly with us.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Times the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy was tendered to mo&s;t Friends that came into the County, if they were taken; and &s;uch were com|mitted to Pri&s;on, for not taking it, till the next A&s;&s;izes, and then premunired; and then little Hopes of their being re|lea&s;ed from their Impri&s;onment; and it came to be a Saying, that when any

<P>About the Year 1669, my ancient, well beloved and dear Companion <HI>John ap John</HI> and I, took our Journey for <HI>South-Wales,</HI> to vi&s;it our Friends and Brethren in tho&s;e Parts: We went fir&s;t into <HI>Radnor&s;hire,</HI> where we had &s;everal good Meetings; and we gave timely No|tice before hand, where we appointed the Meetings, and &s;everal Friends and other People came from <HI>Herefora&s;hire</HI> to meet us at the lower End of the County of <HI>Radnor,</HI> where we had a &s;weet, living Meeting, and the Power of the Lord undered the Hearts of many: We decla|red the Word of the Lord both in <HI>Welch</HI> and in <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and my Friend <HI>John ap John</HI> was very &s;ound and intelligible in the <HI>Welch</HI> Language; he de&s;erved the Right hand of Fellow&s;hip, for he was my Elder, and the fir&s;t Friend that I heard declare in a Meeting, in the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Tongue; and though he was not perfect in that Language, yet he had the Tongue of the Learned, to &s;uch who were &s;piritual. And when that Meeting was ended in <HI>Radnor&s;hire,</HI> we both withdrew a little a&s;ide from Friends, being bowed
<PB N="142" REF="006833_0082_102A5FC463E1E9C0">before the Lord, in a Sen&s;e of his Good|ne&s;s among&s;t us. So after a little while, I turned my Face towards the Friends, and I &s;aw a Man coming towards me with much Brokenne&s;s and Tears, when he came, he took me in his Arms, and field me there, and I was very tender of him; though I knew him not; he asked me whether I did not know him? and I told him I did not; though I &s;aid, I could remember &s;omething of him: He &s;aid he had Cau&s;e to remember me. And when I looked upon him again, I asked him whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was not <HI>Roger Prichard?</HI> And he &s;aid, he was the Man that had gone a&s;tray. And I was glad, yea very glad, that the lo&s;t Sheep was found, and that he came to know the true Shepherd and his Voice in him&s;elf, and he follow|ed him, and went not a&s;tray again, as|he did before; and he accompanied us to &s;everal Meetings in that County, and in <HI>Monmouth&s;hire.</HI> And as we were parting with him, <HI>John ap John</HI> told him, he had come far out of his Way with us: He an&s;wered, we put him in his right Way again, and he hoped he &s;hould keep in it.</P>
<P>So we went through <HI>Monmouth&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Glamorgan&s;hire,</HI> vi&s;iting Friends; we
<PB N="143" REF="006833_0082_102A5FC463E1E9C0">had a good Meeting at a Place called <HI>Scilly,</HI> and at <HI>Swanzy</HI> in <HI>Glamorgan&s;hire;</HI> where we met &s;ome <HI>French Britains;</HI> we could under&s;tand &s;omething of their Lan|guage; we found they were pa&s;&s;ionate among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>From thence we pa&s;&s;ed to <HI>Carmarthen|&s;hire;</HI> we had a Meeting at <HI>Cardiff,</HI> and lodged at one <HI>John Mayo</HI>'s, and his Wife <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who was as a Nur&s;ing-Mo|ther to Friends in the Beginning. At <HI>Cardiff, John ap John,</HI> &s;uffered great Per|&s;ecution and in other Parts of that Coun|try, before I was convinced, I &s;uppo&s;e he might be Pri&s;oner in 1653, or 1654.</P>
<P>We went thence towards <HI>Pembroke|&s;hire,</HI> where we had &s;everal good Meet|ings, and the Lord was with us. Then we came homewards; but before we part|ed with <HI>Roger Prichard,</HI> we appointed a Meeting at his Hou&s;e, which was in <HI>Almeley Wooton;</HI> the Lord helped us on in our Journey and we came there accor|ding to the Time appointed, and a large, &s;weet, comfortable Meeting we had there; I know not that any Meeting had been there before; I appointed another Meeting to be there; and in a few Weeks after my Return Home, I went there my|&s;elf accordingly. The Concern of that
<PB N="144" REF="006833_0083_102A5FC716566A10">Part of the Country in <HI>Hereford&s;hire</HI> was much upon me, and I was often there; and when the People of that Village would &s;ee me come, they would &s;ay one to another, <HI>Come, let us go to Mr.</HI> Pri|chard's, <HI>for we &s;hall have Prayers there to Night;</HI> and the Hou&s;e hath been &s;oon near full of People, and a comfortable Time we u&s;ed to have together, and ma|ny were gathered to the Lord in tho&s;e Parts.

<P>About this Time I was pretty much at Home; and the Enemy and Adver&s;a|ry of the Growth and Pro&s;perity of Truth in the&s;e Parts, &s;tirr'd up an Infor|mer again&s;t us, one <HI>John David,</HI> alias <HI>Pugh,</HI> a Weaver, one who was a Tenant to the Goaler, and we had our Meeting in an upper Room in our Pri&s;on, and the &s;aid Informer dwelt below; and

He &s;aid, <HI>Richard Davies</HI> hath preached three Times this Day, and that by the Laws there is 60 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR></HI> on the Preach|er for the &s;ame. By this it was noi&s;ed about in the Town, that I was like to be undone; my Neighbours &s;eem'd to be concern'd thereat; and on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Aldermen, that was a Relation of mine, came chidingly to me, and asked me whether I had a Mind to ruin my Wife and Family? Could I not leave my Preaching, when I knew the Laws were to &s;evere again&s;t us? I told him, I could not, when the Lord required it of me. I de&s;ired him to let the Informer alone, and let him take his Cour&s;e. He &s;aid he would not; but &s;aid he, I will tell thee what I will do, I will take him along with me to <HI>Severn</HI> Side, and whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> my Knife very &s;harp, and I will cut off one of the Rogue's Ears; and if ever he informs again&s;t thee again, I will cut off the other.

<PB N="146" REF="006833_0084_102A5FC8A43A6DE8">&s;ome Mi&s;chief in one Place or another.</P>
<P>This Informer was a Weaver by Trade, and the Neighbours took their Work away from him, &s;o that his Chil|dren went &s;oon after a begging, many of the Town telling them, Their Father had got a new, rich Trade in Hand, and that they need not give them any Thing. So the poor Children &s;uffer'd very much; but my Wife did not with-hold her Hand of Charity towards them.</P>
<P>One Time I had my Boots on ready to go out, the Jaylor, that was this In|former's Landlord, &s;eeing him come up the Street towards my Hou&s;e, I being in the Street, he &s;aid to the Informer, Mr. <HI>Informer,</HI> you &s;ee <HI>Richard Davies</HI> is go|ing out to Preach &s;omewhere to Day, and I advi&s;e you to look diligently after your Bu&s;ine&s;s, and find him out; and if you will not inform again&s;t him, I will inform again&s;t you: You have got a good Trade in Hand; and if you do this great Service for the King, you mu&s;t needs have either <HI>Dolobran</HI> or <HI>Caedcow|rid</HI> for your Pains. The one was the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, and the other the Join|ture-hou&s;e that belonged to my Friend <HI>Charles Lloyd,</HI> and his Ance&s;tors. And thus the Jaylor jeer'd him; and the
<PB N="147" REF="006833_0084_102A5FC8A43A6DE8">poor Informer travell'd great Part of that Day from one Friend's Hou&s;e to another, to &s;ee for me, till he came to <HI>Dolobran,</HI> where we were met upon the Church Af|fairs, and as we were coming from the Meeting, I met him at the Door, and di&s;cour&s;ed a little with him; he told us, that he was going for a Warrant again&s;t us to <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Herbert:</HI> I felt the Power of God was over him, and Truth reigned among us. He went to the &s;aid Lord, and de&s;ired a Warrant again&s;t the <HI>Quakers;</HI> the <HI>Lord</HI> asked him, what did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>Quakers</HI> do? He &s;aid, they Preached. He queried of him, where did they Preach? He told the Lord, they preached in his Hou&s;e, which was their Pri&s;on. The Lord an&s;wered, let 'em Preach there as long as they will, what have I to &s;ay to them? But the <HI>Informer</HI> told the Lord, that they did meet at <HI>Cloddiecochion;</HI> he asked him, whether tho&s;e there were not Pri&s;oners? He an&s;wered, they were, Then &s;aid the Lord, what do they do at <HI>Cloddiecochion?</HI> do they Preach there? He &s;aid, No, their Way was to &s;it down, and to look one upon another. The Lord an&s;wered, thou art but a Fool; the <HI>Quakers</HI> be a loving People, they went
<PB N="148" REF="006833_0085_102A5FCAC6E7E9F0">to vi&s;it their Children, and to eat Bread and Chee&s;e with them.</P>
<P>So the Lord took his Cane, and went from him with his Gentleman to walk in his Park; this Informer followed them, and &s;poke again to the Lord, and &s;aid, Will you be plea&s;ed to grant me a Warrant again&s;t the <HI>Quakers?</HI> The Lord asked him, who &s;ent him there for a Warrant? And he &s;aid, Dr. <HI>Davies.</HI> [This was the pre&s;ent Prie&s;t of <HI>Welch|pool,</HI> and a peaceable Man, and no Per|&s;ecutor.] The Lord asked him again, whether he had a Letter from him? The Informer &s;aid, No, he thought his Word might be &s;ufficient to get a Warrant a|gain&s;t the <HI>Quakers.</HI> Upon this the Lord with Indignation (it is thought) would have &s;poil'd him had not his Gentleman interpos'd. The Lord &s;aid to him, Is it not &s;ufficient to put my peaceable Neighbours in Pri&s;on? Mu&s;t I give a Warrant to make &s;uch a Rogue as this is rich, by uining them and their Families? So the Informer return|ed Home, and as I was going by his Hou&s;e, he de&s;ired me to walk in, for he had &s;omething to &s;ay to me: So I went in with him, and he &s;aid to me, I am &s;orry I did you &s;o much Wrong, for I
<PB N="149" REF="006833_0085_102A5FCAC6E7E9F0">Intended much Evil again&s;t you; I was put on to be an Informer, which proved to be mine and my Childrens R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in; for my Neighbours took their Work from me, and when my Children went to their Doors, they would &s;carce give them my Thing to relieve them: And now I de&s;ire you to pray to God to forgive me; and I pray you to forgive me al|&s;o; for I think mo&s;t of our Bi&s;hops are <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and there is no Tru&s;t to be put in them. I de&s;ired him to have a Care what he &s;aid, and not lay the Fault there; for it was the Enemy, the Ad|ver&s;ary, the Devil, that begot that co|vetous Mind in him again&s;t his peaceable Neighbours. So I de&s;ired the Lord to forgive him; and as for me, and my Friends, we would forgive him; and I de&s;ired him to go his Way, and to do &s;o no more. So he never inform'd again&s;t us afterwards.</P>
<P>And thus the Lord helped us, and pre|&s;erved us through great Hard&s;hips and Difficulties. There was nothing taken from us at this Time, upon this Inform|er's Account.</P>
<P>About the Year 1675. we heard that there was a &s;evere Per&s;ecution by Inform|ers in <HI>Merioneth&s;hire,</HI> e&s;pecially in <HI>Pen|llyn,</HI>

<PB N="152" REF="006833_0087_102A5FD1699372A8">and we were concerned to go and vi&s;it the&s;e Ju&s;tices.

Thence we went to <HI>R&ucirc;g,</HI> where this Colons <HI>Salisbury</HI> lived; and we enquired, before, we came to the Hou&s;e, whether he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Home? Some told us he was: But when we came there, they perceived we were the&s;e People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> by our Habit and Language; and he being con&s;cious to him&s;elf what he had done, and what Spoil was made upon Friends Goods, would not admit us to &s;peak with him. We de&s;ired one of his Servants to acquaint him, that we had come a great Way to vi&s;it our &s;uf|fering Friends in that County; and my Friend <HI>Charles Lloyd</HI> bid him tell him who he was; for it &s;eems he was his Relation, and an old School fellow. From thence we went to <HI>John ap John</HI>'s, near <HI>Wrexham,</HI> in <HI>Denbigh&s;hire,</HI> and vi|&s;ited Friends there; and from thence we came Home to our Families, where we
<PB N="153" REF="006833_0087_102A5FD1699372A8">found all Things well; and the Lord was with us in our Journey.</P>
<P>Some Time after this, it lay upon me to go and vi&s;it Friends in <HI>London;</HI> and I went to &s;ee the Lord <HI>Powis</HI> and his Lady (who dwelt then at <HI>London</HI>) they were my particular Friends; and I acquainted them with the Sufferings of our Friends in <HI>Merioneth&s;hire</HI> by Informers upon the &s;ate Act? And they asked me, Which Way they might be helpful to Friends? I told them, that if they would be plea&s;ed to get a few Lines from their Brother the Duke of <HI>Beanford,</HI> who was then Lord-Pre&s;ident of <HI>Wales,</HI> to Colonel <HI>Price</HI> of <HI>Rhiwlas,</HI> I did not que&s;tion but that would moderate them very much: For the &s;aid Colonel was not in the main a Per&s;ecutor, but was put on by &s;ome peevi&s;h Clergy-men (&s;o called) in a lit|tle Time they got his Letter for me, with his own Seal thereon, but not &s;eal'd up; the Tenure of it was thus: <HI>Sir, I have &s;topp'd the Complaint of his Maje&s;ty's Sub|jects, call a</HI> Quakers, <HI>from coming before the Council-Board, concerning the &s;evere Pro&s;ecution of the Penal Laws again&s;t them.</HI> So when I had this Letter, I made what ha&s;te I could down into the Country, and gave it to a Friend and

So it happened that him&s;elf fell into the Snare and Evil that he intended a|gain&s;t his Neighbours.</P>
<P>Some Time afterwards, one <HI>Price,</HI> Prie&s;t of <HI>Llanvawr</HI> in <HI>Merioneth&s;hire,</HI> was &s;evere again&s;t Friends for Tythes, and &s;ome Friends came down to me to <HI>Welch-Pool,</HI> with an Account thereof: I con&s;idered his Proceeding upon a <HI>Quo mi|nus</HI> from the Exchequer, and I cau&s;ed an Attorney to appear for the Friends, and he, in a few Terms, brought me a Writ of Charges again&s;t the Prie&s;t; and when I had it, I was in a great Streight what to do with it, for I knew that if the Prie&s;t was taken upon it, it would exa&s;perate him again&s;t Friends; I &s;ent for &s;ome of the&s;e Friends to be at our Quarterly

The Deputy-Sheriff knew what would be for the Advantage of Friends, and he was ready to do what he could for them: So he blazed it abroad, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> had got a Writ again&s;t the Prie&s;t; and the poor Prie&s;t was afraid of coming to the Steeple-Hou&s;e for &s;everal Days, to perform his Service; &s;o he imployed &s;omebody to come to Friends to make an End of the Matter, and I never heard that he troubled Friends again for Tythe, while he was there.</P>

<P>But nothing was taken from me, though my Family was at the Meeting, and I lived within the Limits of the Corporation.</P>
<P>Now I being at this Time in <HI>London,</HI> and my Service there pretty much in the Time of the &s;aid hard Per&s;ecution; my dear Friend <HI>Charles Lloyd,</HI> &s;ent me up a full and large Account of the Sufferings of Friends there; by the &s;aid wicked in|former, <HI>David Maurice,</HI> and when I had read and con&s;idered them, I was under

<P>Now after this, when the Time of the Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions was come, the Clerk of the Peace told the Court, he had receiv|ed new Commi&s;&s;ions; which being read, and this <HI>D. M.</HI> being then pre&s;ent, and finding him&s;elf left out, fell into a great Rage and Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In a little Time the &s;aid <HI>D.

So that Year we had Peace and Quietne&s;s; and when his Sheriff &s;hip was over, he was coming through a Brook called <HI>Lynlleth,</HI> near his own Hou&s;e at <HI>Pen-y-bont,</HI> and it was &s;uppo&s;ed that his Flor&s;e threw him down, and he was carried down into the River <HI>Tannat,</HI> a

<P>In the latter End of the Year, 1674, I went to vi&s;it my ancient, dear Friend <HI>George Fox,</HI> who was a Pri&s;oner in <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter,</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Hereford&s;hire,</HI> and had &s;ome Meetings there; I &s;taid with my Friend <HI>G.

<PB N="161" REF="006833_0091_102A5FDACC5925E8">on my Hor&s;e along with the Coach, and no other Friend with us.</P>
<P>We came to <HI>London,</HI> the 8th Day of the 12th Month, and when we came there, &s;everal Firends much admired, that he &s;hould be removed up again; for he was &s;omething private in the Matter. So I de&s;ired the Friends, who had the Management of the Bu&s;ine&s;s before, to let me have a Copy of the Record, which was pretty difficult to be had; for &s;eve al thought it was to little or no Purpo&s;e: But <HI>G. F.</HI> being unea&s;y, was not &s;atisfied till I had it. I had acquainted Coun&s;el|lor <HI>Corbet</HI> of the whole Ca&s;e, as far as I could under&s;tand it, before I could &s;ee a Copy of the Record; and about the 10th Hour in the Night, <HI>William Mead</HI> came with me to Coun&s;ellor <HI>Corbet</HI> with it; and when he had read it, he &s;aid, There were &s;everal material Errors in it; which put <HI>W. Mead</HI> to a Con&s;ideration, how that could be; and he de&s;ired the coun&s;ellor to &s;hew him one Error. The Coun&s;ellor &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'d him &s;everal Errors; and <HI>W. Mead</HI> &s;eem'd to wonder that &s;uch great Errors could not have been found out by other Coun&s;el.</P>
<P>The next Morning, being the 11th Day of the 12th Month, we went to
<PB N="162" REF="006833_0092_102A5FDD1C270FD0">Court, where &s;ome other Coun&s;ellors moved fir&s;t on <HI>G.</HI> F's Behalf, and they were pretty clo&s;e upon &s;ome Things, but they knew not of any Errors in the In|dictment: All this while Coun&s;ellor <HI>Corbet</HI> was &s;ilent. There was one Coun|&s;ellor <HI>Walcott,</HI> who was again&s;t <HI>G. Fox</HI> (and fearing le&s;t they &s;hould find &s;ome Errors in the Indictment) he moved that the Oath &s;hould be tender'd again to <HI>G.

Where upon the Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Hales</HI> &s;aid, Mr. <HI>Corbet,</HI> you &s;hould have come &s;ooner, at the Beginning of the Term, with that Plea. He an&s;wered, We could not get a Copy of the Return, and of the Indict|ment. The Judge replied, You &s;hould have told us, and we would have forced them to have made Return &s;ooner. Then &s;aid Judge <HI>Wild,</HI> Mr. <HI>Corbet,</HI> you go up|on general Terms, and if it be &s;o as you &s;ay, we have committed many Errors at the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> and in other Courts. <HI>Cor|bet</HI> was po&s;itive, that by Law they could not impri&s;on upon a Premunire. The Judge &s;aid, There is Summons in the Statute. Yes, &s;aid <HI>Corbet,</HI> but Sum|mons is not Impri&s;onment; for Sum|mons
<PB N="163" REF="006833_0092_102A5FDD1C270FD0">is in order to a Trial. Well, &s;aid the Judge, we mu&s;t have Time to look in our Books, and con&s;ult the Statutes: So the Hearing was put off till the next Day. As we were going out of <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI>-Hall, &s;ome Friends were much troubled, that the <HI>Welch</HI> Coun&s;ellor &s;hould &s;tart &s;uch a Plea, contrary to the Opinion of the Judges, and all the Coun&s;ellors; and &s;ome of them &s;aid, they thought <HI>G.

I de&s;ired Friends to have a little Patience, for I thought the <HI>Welch</HI> Coun&s;ellor would &s;tand upon his own Legs. So I went to the Hall again, and &s;taid for Coun&s;ellor <HI>Corbet</HI> till the Court was up; and when I found him, I told him he &s;tarted that up that many thought he could not make good; and if &s;o, it would be a Reflection upon me, and the <HI>Welch</HI> Coun&s;ellor, as they called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. He de&s;ired me to bring him that Evening another Copy of the Record be&s;ides what he had. So I got one, and went with it to him; and he writ in the Margent &s;omething in <HI>Brench,</HI> and give it me again, and de&s;i|red
<PB N="164" REF="006833_0093_102A5FDEAFC00F60">me to go with it to <HI>Thomas Rudyard,</HI> who was an Attorney in <HI>London</HI> for <HI>G.

For,</P>
<P>The next Day, they cho&s;e rather to let that Plea fall, and begin with the Er|rors of the Indictment; and when they came to be opened, they were &s;o many and &s;o gro&s;s, that the Judges were all of Opinion, that the Indictment was qua&s;h'd and void, and that <HI>G.F.</HI> ought to have his Liberty: Upon which Proclamation was made, That if any had any Thing to &s;ay again&s;t <HI>G. Fox,</HI> let them come forth and they &s;hall be heard, otherwi&s;e he is di&s;charged. And &s;o he was &s;et at Liberty.</P>
<P>Coun&s;ellor <HI>Corbet,</HI> who pleaded this Cau&s;e, got great Fame by it; for many of the Lawyers came to him, and told him, He had brought that to Light, which had not been kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> before, as to the not Impri&s;oning upon a Preminire.

<P><PB N="165" REF="006833_0093_102A5FDEAFC00F60">
As we were coming out of the Court, I had an Opportunity to &s;peak to &s;ome of <HI>London,</HI> and to blame them for their Un|belief; becau&s;e they could not believe, that any Good could come from that Plea: I was then of the Mind, and &s;till am, that the Hand of the Lord was in it, more than the Wit and Cunning of Man; for that Trial put an End to all the Pre|munires in the Nation. Our Friends, in this County of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> were mo&s;t of them under a Sentence of Premunire for many Years. Our Friend <HI>Charles Lloyd</HI> was not &s;uffer'd to &s;ee his own Hon&s;e for &s;everal Years, altho' it was but about five Miles from <HI>Welch-Pool,</HI> where he was kept a Pri&s;oner.

1677. Some Years after this Trial of <HI>G.

He was a wicked, hard-heart|ed Man, and intended much Mi&s;chief to Friends, if the Lord had not prevented him. So Friends of that County ac|quainted us here of the whole Proceed|ings in that Affair; it being the Time that the Parliament was &s;itting; Friends concluded, that our Friend <HI>Tho.

<PB N="167" REF="006833_0094_102A5FE4B6D91788">he was much concerned about it, for he was very well acquainted with this <HI>Walcott;</HI> and he &s;aid, By that Way they might try us all, if <HI>Popery</HI> came up again; for they have (&s;aid he) the Law (or Writ) <HI>De Haeretico Comburendo</HI> in Force, which was executed in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Days for the Burning of Here|ticks, which was not repealed to this Day. So Coun&s;ellor <HI>Corbet</HI> and <HI>Thomas Lloyd</HI> went to the Parliament Hou&s;e, and acquainted &s;everal Parliament-men of it, and that Se&s;&s;ions it was repealed; and Judge <HI>Walcott</HI> was &s;poken to in <HI>London,</HI> and our Friends were no fur|ther pro&s;ecuted, but had their Liberty: And ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, Friends had great Peace and Quietne&s;s in that Coun|ty for a con&s;iderable Time afterwards. And in a few Years this Judge <HI>Walcott</HI> died; and &s;o there was an End of that Per&s;ecutor.</P>
<P>In the Year 1677. our Friend <HI>John Burnyeat</HI> came to give us a Vi&s;it in <HI>Wales.</HI> and had a Meeting at a Town called <HI>Ma|chynlleth</HI> in <HI>Montgomery&s;hire,</HI> where there appeared an Informer, one <HI>Oliver Mau|rice</HI> of <HI>Drain Llwidion</HI> in <HI>Merioneth&s;hire,</HI> and cau&s;ed Di&s;turbance there; and went afterwards to one <HI>William Pugh</HI> of <HI>Math|afern,</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="006833_0095_102A384367BE6C58">near <HI>Machynlleth</HI> afore&s;aid, a Ju|&s;tice of the Peace for this County (he was one of them that had his Comm&s;&s;ion when <HI>D.

The next Day, the Lord of <HI>Powis</HI> being at Home, at his Ca&s;tle of <HI>Powis,</HI> I went to him, and ac|quainted him thereof; and when he heard it, he was very &s;orry.

<P>Some Time after there was in this C. of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> one <HI>Hughes,</HI> Prie&s;t in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Hirnant,</HI> where lived a Friend, one <HI>John Rhydderch,</HI> an hone&s;t Man, who con&s;cienciou&s;ly refu&s;ed to pay Tythe: This Prie&s;t having got Judgment again&s;t him out of the County Court, &s;eve|ral of his Cattle were drave away on that Account by the Sheriff's Bailiffs; but our Friend being well acquainted with the Deputy-&s;heriff, inform'd him of the Errors in the&s;e Proceedings; and the Sheriff ordered the Bailiffs to return the Friend his Cattle: The Prie&s;t was in a great Fret, that he lo&s;t all that Charge.

<PB N="170" REF="006833_0096_102A5FE845B6C4C0">Marches of <HI>Wales.</HI> This Court was a great Yoke and Bondage to Friends in this Dominion; for all An&s;wers were to be given upon Oath in that Court, which Friends could not do for Con&s;cience Sake. This Prie&s;t followed the Friend with one Contempt after another, till it came to a Writ of Rebellion: We let him go on as far as he could, till the Friend was ready to be taken; our At|torney that we did employ gave us, an Account of it, and I de&s;ired the Friend to go to a Friend's Hou&s;e in <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> which was out of the Juri&s;diction of that Court and &s;tay there till he &s;hould hear from me. And I &s;ent to <HI>London</HI> to <HI>John Lloyd,</HI> Brother to <HI>Charles Lloyd</HI> of <HI>Dolobran,</HI> who belonged to the Chance|ry Office, and he &s;ent me down a Prohi|bition, and I &s;ent to &s;erve the Prie&s;t and Attorney with it: The Prie&s;t fell into a very great Rage, and his Attorney came to him for Seven Pounds Charge that he laid out for him, but the Prie&s;t would not pay him; &s;o the Attorney &s;ued him, and got Judgment again&s;t him, that the poor Prie&s;t could not go to perform his wonted Service for &s;ome Time.

<P>Our Friend <HI>Charles Lloyd</HI> of <HI>Dolobran,</HI> was &s;ued for Tythe at the great A&s;&s;izes held for this County of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> by the Earl of <HI>Ca&s;tlemain,</HI> Impropriator, and <HI>Randal Davies,</HI> Vicar of <HI>Myvod,</HI> the Pari&s;h that our Friend <HI>Charles Lloyd</HI> lived in; we were &s;atisfied it was a Court of Record, and they might &s;ue for treble Damage for not paying Tythe: So we concluded to go with a Copy of their Declaration to Coun&s;ellor <HI>Corbet,</HI> who lived then at <HI>Welch-pool,</HI> and when he read it, he &s;aid, he would demur to it; I asked him whether he could damur in the Ca&s;e of Tythe; he &s;aid, he would maintain a Demurrer to that Declaration; &s;o when the Court &s;at, he acquainted the Judge that he would demur to that De|claration; the Judge &s;aid, Demur in the Ca&s;e of Tythe?

<PB N="172" REF="006833_0097_102A5FEBD1C1F5A0">mended the Declaration, and next A&s;&s;i|zes they obtained Judgment upon <HI>Nihil dicit.</HI> And &s;o <HI>Charles Lloyd</HI>'s Cattle were driven for treble Damage, but the Prie&s;t was &s;o perplexed, and put to Charge and Trouble, that I do not know he ever &s;ued any Friend for Tythe again.</P>
<P>After this I went to <HI>London</HI> to the Yearly Meeting, and continued there &s;ometime, in and about the City, and &s;o came lei&s;urely down through &s;everal Meetings, vi&s;iting Friends; and while af|ter I came Home, <HI>Thomas Ellis</HI> and <HI>James Halladay</HI> came to our Town, I told <HI>James</HI> it was well done in him to give us a Vi&s;it in the&s;e Parts of <HI>Wales;</HI> they &s;aid, they came to vi&s;it us again&s;t their Wills; I asked them, whether they were Pri&s;oners? they &s;aid, they were: And &s;oon after came other Friends along with them, I took them all with me to my Hou&s;e to refre&s;h them|&s;elves; they told me, that <HI>James Halli|day</HI> came from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>South-Wales,</HI> intending to take Shipping t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> for <HI>Ireland,</HI> to be at the Half-year's Meet|ing, but the Wind proving contrary, he was nece&s;&s;itated to come for <HI>North Wales</HI> to <HI>Holy-head,</HI> and having a Meeting in this County, near <HI>Llamdlos,</HI> they were

</LETTER>
<P>About the Year 1680, or 1681, there came one Dr. <HI>William Lloyd,</HI> late of <HI>Martins</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> to be Bi&s;hop of this Dioce&s;s, called St. <HI>A&s;aph;</HI> Per&s;ecution was very &s;harp and &s;evere in &s;everal Pla|ces about this Time, upon Account of Excommunication, and the Statute of 20 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR></HI> a Month. But this new Bi&s;hop thought to take a more mild Way to work, by &s;ummoning all Sorts of Di&s;&s;en|ters to di&s;cour&s;e with him, and to &s;eek to per&s;wade them to turn to the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and among the re&s;t, when he came to <HI>Welch-pool</HI> in his Vi&s;itation, he &s;ent for us; &s;o <HI>Charles Lloyd, Thomas Lloyd,</HI> and my&s;elf, waited, &s;eeking to &s;peak with him: But I was that Day bound for <HI>London,</HI> &s;o I could not &s;peak with him; but my Friends &s;taid till they had an Opportunity with him; and my Friend <HI>Charles Lloyd</HI> gave me an
<PB N="177" REF="006833_0099_102A5FF24D498CE0">Account afterwards, of what pa&s;&s;ed, be|tween them, which was to this Effect, in &s;hort:</P>
<P>How that the Bi&s;hop was much di&s;|plea&s;ed that I was ab&s;ent, and when he was told of my urgent Occa&s;ions to go, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y Stay on Purpo&s;e &s;ome while to &s;ee him; he &s;aid, His Bu&s;ine&s;s was greater, whatever my Bu&s;ine&s;s was. That Day they di&s;cour&s;ed with him, his Chaplains, and other Clergy, &s;o called, from about 2 in the Afternoon, till 2 in the Morning; afterwards they di&s;cour&s;ed with him, two other Days at <HI>Llanvilling.</HI> The fir&s;t Day, from about 2 in the Afternoon, till Night; and the next Day, from 10 in the Morning, till an Hour in the Night, publickly in the Town-Hall. The fir&s;t Day at <HI>Pool,</HI> our &s;aid Friends <HI>C. L.</HI> and <HI>Y. L.</HI> gave their Rea&s;ons of Separation; but in none of the three Days, would the Bi&s;hop and his Clergy defend their own Principles, or refute ours: But on|ly held the three Days, on the general Principles of Chri&s;tendom, and the A|po&s;tiles Examples of <HI>Water Bapti&s;m,</HI> and once a &s;mall Touch at the <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine. Thomas Lloyd,</HI> held the la&s;t Day, our Rea&s;ons why we &s;eparated from the Church of England: which were</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="178" REF="006833_0100_102A5FF3F8131270">
1. <HI>Becau&s;e their Wor&s;hip, was not a Go&s;pel Wor&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Becau&s;e their Mini&s;try, was no Go&s;|pel Mini&s;try.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Becau&s;e their Ordinances were no Go&s;pel Ordinances.</HI></P>
<P>But they would not join with him to prove any of them, though often &s;ollicit|ed thereunto; but Friends being Suffer|ers, &s;ubmit to all Di&s;advantages: For they had not any Notice before-hand of what Matters they &s;hould argue, till they came to the Place of Di&s;pute; and the la&s;t Day, they forced <HI>Thomas Lloyd,</HI> to about 28 Syllogi&s;ms, all written down as they di&s;puted, to be an&s;wered extem|pore; and the Bi&s;hop &s;aid he did not ex|pect &s;o much could be &s;aid by any on that Subject, on &s;o little Warning. And he &s;aid, That he expected not to find &s;o much <HI>Civility</HI> from the <HI>Quakers;</HI> he highly commended <HI>Thomas Lloyd;</HI> and our &s;aid Friends came off with them ve|ry well. They had al&s;o much Di&s;cour&s;e with the Chancellor, and with one <HI>Hen|ry Dodwell,</HI> and the Dean of <HI>Bangor,</HI> now Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hereford,</HI> very learned Men, who were al&s;o at the Di&s;pute, with many of the Clergy of the Di|oce&s;s, with &s;ome Ju&s;tices of the Peace,
<PB N="179" REF="006833_0100_102A5FF3F8131270">and Deputy Lieutenants of the County, and a great Concour&s;e of People, in the Town-Hall, afore&s;aid, in <HI>Llanvilling.</HI> Several of the Clergy, with whom I af|terwards di&s;cour&s;ed, &s;eemed not well &s;a|tisfied with that Di&s;pute: For they &s;aid, they thought that the Validity of <HI>Water Bapti&s;m</HI> was much weakened thereby; and &s;everal noted Men, that were pre&s;ent at the &s;aid Di&s;pute: &s;aid, that they thought there could not be &s;o much &s;aid again&s;t <HI>Water Bapti&s;m,</HI> as had been &s;aid there: But it was agreed by Con&s;ent of all Parties concerned, that the Di&s;pute &s;hould not be printed.</P>
<P>About this Time I &s;tay'd a pretty while in <HI>London;</HI> and when the Lord made Way for me, I took my Leave of the City Friends, letting them under|&s;tand, that I was preparing Homewards, intending for my Pri&s;on upon the Writ <HI>De Excommunicato Capiendo,</HI> that was out again&s;t me, and our Friends, and other Di&s;&s;enters, in this Dioce&s;s of St. <HI>A&s;aph.</HI> A little Time before I came out of the City, there came two or three grave Citizens (I &s;uppo&s;e of the <HI>Indepen|dent</HI> Congregation) and told me, They were come to let me know, that there was a Writ <HI>De Excommunicato Capiendo</HI>
<PB N="180" REF="006833_0101_102A5FF861816868">out again&s;t me, and there was one of their Friends in Pri&s;on already on the &s;ame Writ in our County, and if I would contribute with them, they &s;aid, they knew how to make it void. I told them, I knew there was a Writ out again&s;t me; and I did al&s;o know there was a Friend of theirs, one <HI>Richard Trollus</HI> in Pri&s;on in <HI>Welch-Pool</HI> on that Writ. I told them, I thought they might make the Writ void, but I would contribute nothing towards St; for I told them I would ha&s;ten Home as &s;oon as I could, and go to Pri&s;on, if required: But they &s;aid, They were &s;a|tisfied I had other Rea&s;ons why I would not make the Writ void, and de&s;ired me to be free with them, and tell them my Rea&s;ons. I told them, I thought they might make that Writ void with a great deal of Charges; but, &s;aid I, how will you prevent the Bi&s;hop from coming on again with another Writ, which you cannot make void? and if there be any Error in their Proceedings in this, no Doubt but the Bi&s;hop and Chancellor will mend it in the next: And whether do you think it is better for me to go to Pri|&s;on on this fal&s;e Writ, or on a Writ that you can find no Error in? I &s;aid, if I go to Pri&s;on on this erroneous Writ, and
<PB N="181" REF="006833_0101_102A5FF861816868">the Sheriff or Jaylor gives me my Liberty the Bi&s;hop or the Chancellor cannot ju&s;t|ly &s;ue them. And &s;o tho&s;e Men went a|way well &s;atisfied with the Rea&s;ons I gave them; and I know of no Money they &s;pent to make the Writ void.</P>
<P>I acquainted my Friend <HI>William Penn,</HI> and &s;ome other Friends, that I intended to give the &s;aid Bi&s;hop <HI>Lloyd</HI> a Vi&s;it be|fore I went to Pri&s;on, if the Lord was plea&s;ed to make Way for me. So my Friend <HI>W. P.</HI> the Morning before I came out of the City, &s;ent me a Letter from the Lord <HI>Hide</HI> to the Bi&s;hop, with his Coat of Arms on it, un&s;eal'd. So I took my Journey, and the Lord brought me &s;afe Home, to the Comfort of my Family and Friends, who were afraid I had been detained from coming Home.</P>
<P>Soon after my Return (even the next Morning) I &s;et out to &s;ee the Bi&s;hop, without Interruption; tho' the Sheriff, one <HI>Geoge M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rcer,</HI> was very envious to Friends, yet I e&s;caped his Hands at this Time. I went to my Friend <HI>Tho. Wynne</HI>'s, who lived in a Town called <HI>Caerwys</HI> in <HI>Flint&s;hire,</HI> not far from &s;aid Bi&s;hop's Pa|lace, and he went with me; and when we came there, the Bp's. Secretary came to the Gate, I asked him, Whether the
<PB N="182" REF="006833_0102_102A60261743C3C8">Bi&s;hop was within? He &s;aid he was; and asked me, who would &s;peak with him? I told him, That there was one <HI>Richard Davies</HI> would &s;peak with him: What, &s;aid he, of <HI>Welch-pool?</HI> Yes, &s;aid I: What &s;aid the Secretary, my Lord Bi&s;hop: Bi&s;hop, as it &s;ignifies an Over&s;eer, &s;aid I, I am; but Lord Bi&s;hop, I deny. So the Bi&s;hop &s;ent for us in; there were &s;everal Clergymen with him, and among the re&s;t the Dean of <HI>Bangor</HI> before men|tioned. The Bi&s;hop &s;eemed to be di&s;&s;atisfi|ed, that I was not with them at the Di&s;|pute at <HI>Llanvilling:</HI> We went &s;oon to di&s;pute about Water Bapti&s;m; I told them, <HI>There was one Lord, one Faith, and one Bapti&s;m;</HI> and that Bapti&s;m was nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation; and that Water Bapti&s;m, which was <HI>John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m, was to continue and remain but for a Sea&s;on. So this, and &s;uch like Di&s;cour&s;e, held us till it was late that Night; and then I went to my Friend's Hou&s;e, with an Order to be there again in the Morning. So I came in the Morning, and we di&s;|puted upon the &s;ame Subject: I &s;aid, If one &s;hould grant what they de&s;ired, <HI>viz.</HI> that Water Bapti&s;m was nece&s;&s;ary to Sal|vation, which I would not, where &s;hould they have an Admini&s;trator, &s;eeing that
<PB N="183" REF="006833_0102_102A60261743C3C8"><HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays expre&s;ly, <HI>He was not &s;ent to Baptize, but to Preach the Go&s;pel;</HI> and thanked God, that <HI>he Baptized none,</HI> except &s;uch and &s;uch, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 14, 17. And <HI>Peter,</HI> who Baptized many, came &s;o to &s;ee the Invallidity of Water Bap|ti&s;m, that he &s;aid, <HI>By Bapti&s;m we are &s;aved, (not the putting away the Filth of the Fle&s;h,</HI> (which outward Water could do no farther) <HI>but the An&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience towards God, by the Re&s;urrec|tion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">1? So they went from this to their Ordination: I put them upon to prove, who &s;ent them to baptize; and &s;o the Dean told me Such an One ordained him; and &s;o he named from one to another. I told him, I thought I &s;hould &s;end him to <HI>Rome</HI> for their Succe&s;&s;ion and Ordination. And they &s;aid, Yes, the Ordination might be good, tho' it came from <HI>Rome.</HI> He bro't a Compari&s;on; as, Suppo&s;e a Malefactor was condemned to die, and a Reprieve was obtained, and it came down by the Hang-man's Hand; and tho' it came &s;o, yet (&s;aid he) the Pardon was good. Then &s;aid I, Your Ordination comes not by the Spirit and Power of God. This Re|turn made them &s;omewhat unea&s;y; and the Time being pretty far &s;pent, I was
<PB N="184" REF="006833_0103_102A5FFB98D78EE0">willing to be di&s;charged, having been there in all Part of three Days.</P>
<P>I told the Bi&s;hop of good old <HI>David,</HI> who &s;aid, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> xxvi. 6. <HI>I will wa&s;h my Hands in Innocency, then will I compa&s;s thy Alter, O God; that with the Voice of Thank&s;giving I may publi&s;h and tell of all thy wond'rous Works.</HI> Then I &s;aid to the Bi&s;hop, Thou can&s;t not &s;ay, thou wilt wa&s;h thy Hands in Innocency, nor compa&s;s the Alter of God, while thy Writs remain again&s;t &s;o many innocent People, that are willing to &s;uffer till Death for the Te&s;timony of their Con|&s;ciences towards God: And I &s;aid, Bi&s;hop <HI>Lloyd,</HI> if I go to Pri&s;on upon this Account, I &s;hall have more Peace there, than thou &s;halt have in thy Palace. And I &s;aid to him again, Suppo&s;e another Prince &s;hould ari&s;e, that would impo&s;e &s;omething upon thee, that thou could'&s;t not do for Con&s;cience &s;ake, what would'&s;t thou do? He &s;aid Then I will go to <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> al&s;o (for at that Time many Friends were about going there.) Then it came clearly to me, and I &s;aid to the Bi&s;hop, Though thy Head be gray, yet thou may'&s;t live to &s;ee Liberty of Con&s;cience in <HI>England;</HI> though, as to outward
<PB N="185" REF="006833_0103_102A5FFB98D78EE0">Appearance it &s;eemed to be very far from it at that Time.</P>
<P>Then the Bi&s;hop called for Pen and and Ink, and &s;aid, he would write to the Chancellor for my Liberty; but I told him, I was not &s;atisfied for my&s;elf to be at Liberty, and my Friends to be in Pri&s;on: So he wrote to the Chancel|lor to &s;u&s;pend the Execution of the Writ; and when he had done, he read the Let|ter to me, and I owned his Kindne&s;s to us all therein. And then I took the Lord <HI>Hide</HI>'s Letter out of my Pocket, and gave it him; and when he &s;aw the Super&s;cription, and knew from whom it was, he asked me, how I came by it? I told him, as I was coming out of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> intending for Pri&s;on, a Friend of mine brought me that Letter the &s;ame Morning that I left the City. When he had read it, he &s;aid, he hoped I was &s;a|tisfied that he had granted me the Con|tents of that Letter. I told him, I was &s;o, and I hoped he &s;hould have a Reward for his Well-doing.</P>
<P>Then I was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and had Leave to come Home, and brought a Letter to <HI>John Edwards,</HI> Chancellor, a peevi&s;h Man again&s;t Friends, who lived at a Place called <HI>Llanymynech,</HI> about eight
<PB N="186" REF="006833_0104_102A5FFE3B5671E8">Miles from <HI>Welch-Pool.</HI> When he re|ceived the Letter, he did according to the Bi&s;hop's Order; and tho&s;e Friends in the Dioce&s;s, that were concerned therein, were not mole&s;ted nor troubled on that Account any more; and the Friends that were in Pri&s;on before were di&s;char|ged. And we have great Cau&s;e to ble&s;s and prai&s;e the Lord, for all his Mercies Kindne&s;&s;es, and Deliverances to us; for hitherto he hath been our <HI>Eben-ezer,</HI> that is, <HI>the Lord hath helped us,</HI> 1 Sam. vii. 12.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of the Year 1682, my dear Friend <HI>Charles Lloyd</HI> and I went to vi&s;it Friends in <HI>Hereford&s;hire, Worcester&s;hire,</HI> &amp;c. and &s;o came through their Meetings to <HI>London,</HI> before the Yearly Meeting. I acquainted my Friends <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> and <HI>W.

White|head</HI> &s;aid, There was &s;ome Service to be done for &s;uffering Friends in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and it was thought convenient, that Three of the City, and Three of the Country, &s;hould go with the &s;aid Sufferings, and, de&s;ire the Kindne&s;s of the Lord <HI>Hide</HI> to pre&s;ent them to the King; the three Friends for the Country were, <HI>Charles</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="006833_0104_102A5FFE3B5671E8"><HI>Lloyd, Thomas Wynne,</HI> and my&s;elf for the City, <HI>G. Whitehead, Alexander Parker,</HI> and one more. Our Friend <HI>G. W.</HI> told me, that my Countryman Sir <HI>Lionel Jenkin,</HI> Secretary of State, was &s;o cro&s;s and ill-humouv'd, that when the King was inclin'd to Moderation and Tenderne&s;s to &s;uffering Friends, he of|tentimes &s;topp'd and hinder'd the Relief that was intended for them: And when we came to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> we waited a long-Time before we could &s;peak with them, they being upon a Committee a con&s;iderable Time; but we had &s;ent in by the Door-keeper, to acquaint the Lord <HI>Hide</HI> that we were there, and in Time they &s;ent for us in: The Secretary look'd grim upon us. But I went to the Lord HIDE, and did acknowledge his Kindne&s;s for his kind Letter on my Be|half to the Bi&s;hop. He told me, as if I &s;hould tell the Bi&s;hop, there would be Liberty of Con&s;cience in <HI>England.</HI> I told him, I did &s;ay &s;o; and I did believe it would be &s;o in the God of Heaven's Time. Then the Secretary <HI>Jenkins</HI> &s;poke in a &s;cornful Manner, and asked me, What was <HI>Welch</HI> for a <HI>Quaker?</HI> I an&s;wered him, <HI>Crynwr, Crynwyr;</HI> it being the &s;ingular and plural Num|ber.
<PB N="188" REF="006833_0105_102A6000F0B36840">But, &s;aid the Secretary, we had no <HI>Welch</HI> for it, for there were no <HI>Quakers</HI> in the <HI>Romans</HI> Days. Then my Friend <HI>Charles Lloyd</HI> an&s;wered him, and &s;aid, if thou did'&s;t ask my Friend the Que&s;tion right, he hath an&s;wer'd thee right; for there is <HI>Engli&s;h, Welch, Latin, Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew,</HI> for a <HI>Quaker.</HI> The Secretary &s;aid, Sir.

<P>He replied, He was not again&s;t our Friends; but he &s;aid, our Friends gave their Votes for the Election of Parliament-Men that were again&s;t the King's Intere&s;t. I told him, it was our Birth-right, as we were Freeholders and Burge&s;&s;es, to elect Men qualified to &s;erve both King and Country; but how they were corrupted, when they came within the&s;e Walls, I knew not. Then the Secretary would have engaged farther with me in a Di&s;|pute about Religion: I told him, He was an antient Man, and that they had been a long Time there upon their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and if he would be plea&s;ed to di&s;mi&s;s us then, and appoint what Time we &s;hould &s;ome Morning wait upon him, we would, if he plea&s;ed, &s;pend an Hour or two with him in Di&s;cour&s;e about Religion: Upon which he took off his Hat, and thanked me kindly for my Civility; but we heard no more of the Di&s;pute.

<PB N="190" REF="006833_0106_102A600290838618">told me, he was more moderate to Friends afterwards, than he had been before. The Number of Pri&s;oners that were in the &s;aid Li&s;t delivered to the Lord HYDE to be pre&s;ented to the King, in both Pri&s;ons, amounted to 139, of which there were 18 aged Women, from &s;ixty and upwards, and 8 Children.

<P>I had my &s;everal Exerci&s;es this Year 1682. in <HI>London,</HI> both from fal&s;e Bre|thren, and otherwi&s;e: Once I was at the <HI>Bull and Mouth</HI> Meeting, and there were in the Gallery &s;everal trouble&s;ome People, and none of our mini&s;t'ring Bre|thren, that were in true Unity with us, but <HI>G.

<PB N="191" REF="006833_0106_102A600290838618">for Quietne&s;s &s;ake, I &s;ilently b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re the Weight and Exerci&s;e that was upon me, till he had done; and then my Mouth was opened in the Name and Power of God, and the Lord had Compa&s;&s;ion on his afflicted Seed, and cau&s;ed the Light and Life of his Countenance to over&s;ha|dow the Meeting, to the Comfort and great Satisfaction of the Faithful. At which Time I was made to detect the fal&s;e Doctrine which one of them had declared to the People, <HI>viz.</HI> "That the Children of God are de&s;troyed for want of Knowledge." I told the People, That the Children of God in the&s;e Days were the Children of the New Covenant; and the Covenant that he makes with them is. That <HI>they &s;hall know him, from the Lea&s;t to the Greate&s;t,</HI> and the true Knowledge of God to his People in the&s;e Days is Life Eternal, <HI>John</HI> xvii 3.

And the Apo&s;tates in our Days (&s;aid I) have forgot the God that fir&s;t made them acquainted in Mea&s;ure with him: So they having lo&s;t the Sen&s;e of his Goodne&s;s, have &s;epara|ted them&s;elves from the Love and Uni|ty of the Brethren: B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Children of God, who are faithful to the Mea&s;ure of the Grace of God in them&s;elves, know it to be their Teacher and Leader into all Truth.

<P>When I had thus ea&s;ed my Spirit, a Concern came upon our Friend and Bro|ther <HI>G. Whitehead,</HI> and he &s;weetly con|cluded the Meeting in Prayer.</P>
<P>After this I was pretty well cleared of the City, and was willing to draw home|wards, and next Fir&s;t-Day I came to <HI>Jordan</HI>'s Meeting in <HI>Buckingham&s;hire,</HI> where we had a Ble&s;&s;ed Meeting; then I went and had one Meeting at <HI>Che&s;ham,</HI> from thence I went to <HI>Robert Jones</HI>'s near <HI>Tring.</HI> And from thence I went to the Quarterly Meeting at <HI>We&s;ton-Turfield,</HI> not far from <HI>Aylesbury,</HI> where it opened in me, to advi&s;e and coun&s;el Friends, to keep to tho&s;e Rules and Methods that were agreed on among us, in our Mens and Womens Meetings. As I was declar|ing, came in an oppo&s;ite Party; howe|ver I went on, and &s;hewed them how it was agreed among the Apo&s;tles, to &s;end cho&s;en Men, endu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d with the Holy Gho&s;t, to &s;et up good Orders and Methods among them: So I delivered unto them, that it
<PB N="194" REF="006833_0108_102A6006EC9014C0">&s;eemed good to the Holy Gho&s;t, and to us al&s;o, to &s;et up our Mens and Wo|mens Meetings, that the Care and Con|cern of the Church of Chri&s;t, might be upon holy, &s;elf-denying Men and Wo|men, who might take Care of the Father|le&s;s and Widows in their Afflictions, and keep them&s;elves un&s;potted from the World; which the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> &s;ays, is <HI>pure Religion, and undefiled before God,</HI> James i. 27. And that the Care of all, both poor Strangers, and Pri&s;oners in Affliction, might be carefully and tenderly look'd after, and &s;upplied ac|cording to their Nece&s;&s;ities: And that the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t in this Day, might take the Coun&s;el of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 28. <HI>Take heed therefore unto your&s;elves, and to all the Flock over which the Holy Gho&s;t hath made you O|ver&s;eers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purcha&s;ed with his Blood.</HI></P>
<P>When I had ended what I had to &s;ay from the Lord among Friends, one of the &s;aid Party &s;tood up and &s;poke &s;ome|thing by Way of Reflection upon what I then delivered; and when he had done, our Friend <HI>Thomas Ellwood</HI> propo&s;ed to the Meeting, that all &s;hould &s;it down, and wait to feel the Power of God a|mong
<PB REF="006833_0108_102A6006EC9014C0">us, and let that decide, whether I did &s;peak in the Name and Power of God, among them this Day. To which the Meeting agreed, and all were &s;ilent, after which &s;everal Friends, as they were mov'd of the Lord, gave tenderly their Te&s;timony, that what was delivered that Day, was in the Name and Power of God; and that his Pre&s;ence was with us; as hone&s;t <HI>Robert Jones,</HI> and <HI>Richard Ba|ker,</HI> who loved the Lord, and his Ble&s;|&s;ed Truth, with all their Hearts, and &s;eve|ral others pre&s;ent in that Meeting. And there &s;tood up a Young Man, that I knew not, who&s;e Heart was affected and much broken in Spirit, and he &s;aid on this wi&s;e, <HI>There is a Man come this Day among&s;t us, I know not from whence he came, not where he goes; but this I am &s;atisfied, the Lord &s;ent him here, and his Power and Pre&s;ence is with him, and his Te&s;timony is for the God of Truth.</HI> I enquired after|wards, who that Young Man was? And they &s;aid, he was one <HI>John Thornton.</HI> Upon this one of the Party broke in vio|lently and di&s;orderly again&s;t that, that had been agreed upon among us, before the Meeting had fully clear'd 'em&s;elves and &s;mi&s;hed their Te&s;timonies: But it proved greatly to his Di&s;honor and Di&s;grace, &s;o
<PB N="196" REF="006833_0109_102A6008B62AC688">that he was made manife&s;t to tho&s;e that did adhere to him. The Meeting held a long Time, from about Ten in the Morn|ing, till (as they thought) Ten or Ele|ven at Night. But ble&s;sed be the Lord, that doth not leave his People without a Witne&s;s to him&s;elf; and he is the Pre&s;er|ver and Defender of all his People that do wait upon him; and they that tru&s;t in him, are as <HI>Mount Sion,</HI> that cannot be removed.</P>
<P>After this, I made what Ha&s;te I could Home, taking Meetings in my Way; as at <HI>Banbury,</HI> and the Country about, and Part of <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire:</HI> So, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, I came &s;afe Home, to my Wife and Friends, where I found all Things well; ble&s;&s;ed be his Name for ever.</P>
<P>In the Year 1683 I went again to <HI>Lon|don</HI> to the Yearly Meeting, and &s;taid there &s;ome while after mo&s;t of the Coun|try Friends were gone out of the City. I was engaged one Fir&s;t-Day for <HI>Westmin|&s;ter</HI>-Meeting, and there was no Mini|&s;t'ring Friend there but my&s;elf, and &s;e|veral weighty Matters opened in me at that Meeting; as concerning the Church of Chri&s;t, what it was, and on what it was built: I &s;aid, &s;ome be of the Judg|ment,
<PB N="197" REF="006833_0109_102A6008B62AC688">that the Church of Chri&s;t is built upon <HI>Peter;</HI> and I opened to the Under|&s;tanding of the People &s;omething of what is written in the 16th Chapter of <HI>Matthew:</HI> And I &s;hewed them, that that which revealed unto <HI>Peter,</HI> that <HI>Chri&s;t was the Son of God,</HI> was a Mani|fe&s;tation of the Spirit of God which was in <HI>Peter;</HI> for it is &s;aid, <HI>Mat.</HI> xi. 27. <HI>No Man knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any Man the Father &s;ave the Son, and he to whom&s;o|ever the Son will reveal him.</HI> God re|vealed to <HI>Peter</HI> that Chri&s;t was the Son of God; and he is the only Rock that his Church is built upon, the Rock of Ages, the Foundation of many Genera|tions, that the Gates of Hell never pre|vail'd again&s;t: But the Gates of Hell prevail'd again&s;t <HI>Peter,</HI> when he deny'd his Lord and Ma&s;ter in the Time of his Sufferings; and therefore was not like to be the Rock which Chri&s;t built his Church on. It is &s;aid, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 4. <HI>For they drank of that &s;piritual Rock that fol|lowed them, and that Rock was Chri&s;t.</HI> And &s;o Chri&s;t is the Rock, the &s;ure Foundation, that his Church is built up|on.

"That the Hou&s;e of God, the Church of the Living God, is the Pillar and Ground of Truth." This, &s;aid I, may inform the blind and igno|rant People of this Age, that Lime and Stone, and Temples that are made with Hands, are not, as they &s;ay, the Church of Chri&s;t, and the Hou&s;e of God; 'For God dwelleth not in Temples made with Hands,' as &s;aith the Prophet, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> lxvi. 1. and the Martyr <HI>Stephen, Acts</HI> vii. 48, 49. Thus I was concerned to declare the Truth in that Meeting, with much more to the &s;ame Effect. And after Meeting I went with &s;ome Friends towards the City; and as we were going along the Strand, the Queen was coming from her Chapel; and &s;ome of her: Life-Guard were very rude, and with the Staves that they had in their Hands they did knock and beat Friends that had their Hats on, all along as they came; and I received a Blow upon my Head that it &s;well'd, and was &s;ore a con&s;iderable Time. But ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, in all our Exerci&s;es, and Afflictions, his Life, and Power and
<PB N="199" REF="006833_0110_102A600D85877B48">Pre&s;ence bore us up in the Mid&s;t of there all; Prai&s;es be to his pure and holy Name for ever.</P>
<P>In this Time, before I came out of <HI>London,</HI> we met &s;till with more Exer|ci&s;es and Troubles: One Fir&s;t-day in the Morning I was not well, and could not go to the Meeting, nor &s;carcely get out of my Bed; but when the Time of our Afternoon Meeting came, it lay upon me to go to the <HI>Bull and Mouth</HI> Meeting; and I told <HI>Job Bolton,</HI> with whom I lodged, that I mu&s;t go to the &s;aid Meet|ing: He rea&s;on'd with-me; but I told him I would go &s;o far as I could; and he &s;aid he would go with me. And as we went through the Pa&s;&s;age to go in, I heard a Voice, that I was &s;atisfied was not the Voice of a true Shepherd; the Meeting being already gather'd, and ma|ny People there: When I went up to the Gallery, there was one that was Preach|ing of Perfection, who &s;aid, <HI>Be ye per|fect, as your heavenly Father is perfect,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;taid to hear him but a very lit|tle while, till I &s;tood up and judg'd him, and told the People, <HI>That the Kingdom of God &s;tood not in Words, but in Power, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s.</HI> Then this Man went in a Rage down out of the
<PB N="200" REF="006833_0111_102A6010C364B2B8">Meeting, land a con&s;iderable Company followed him; and a Friend or two went after them as far as <HI>Fleet Street,</HI> to &s;ee where they were going; and one of the Company &s;aw the Friend, and de&s;i|red him not to follow them too clo&s;e, le&s;t they &s;hould do him a Diskindne&s;s: For we heard afterwards that there was a Wager laid that this Man (whom &s;ome &s;aid was a <HI>Je&s;uit</HI>) would Preach in the <HI>Quakers</HI> Meeting, and that he &s;hould not be di&s;cover'd; and had he gone without Reproof, they would &s;ay, that a <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> preached in the <HI>Quakers</HI> Meeting, and they could not di&s;cern him: But it was reported in many Places in the City, how that he was detected in the <HI>Quakers</HI> Meeting, and he could not abide there. We have Cau&s;e to ble&s;s the Lord for his Goodne&s;s to his People, that gives them a di&s;cerning Spirit, to judge between Good and Evil, and between tho&s;e that &s;erve God in Truth and Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and all deceitful Hypocrites, who are to be judged and condemned by the Word of his Power.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of the Year 1685. King <HI>Charles</HI> died, and King <HI>James</HI> came to the Throne, and the Statute of 20 <HI>l per</HI> Month, for ab&s;enting from the Publick
<PB N="201" REF="006833_0111_102A6010C364B2B8">Wor&s;hip, (which I &s;uppo&s;e was made a|gain&s;t the Papi&s;ts in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Days) had been and was very much put in Force again&s;t our Friends, whereby many of them were almo&s;t ruined; the Sheriffs and their Bailiffs per&s;ecuted them &s;o &s;everely, and did make &s;uch a Prey of them, that &s;ome that were worth many Hundreds, were made &s;o de&s;titute, that they had &s;carcely a Bed to lie upon, but were as it were robbed of all. And when King <HI>James</HI> came to be &s;ettled upon the Throne, our dear Friend <HI>G. Whitebead,</HI> who always was much concerned for the Sufferings of Friends up and down in the Nation, and who did not &s;pare him&s;elf to vi&s;it Kings and Parliaments, and all others, where he thought he could get Relief for his Suffering Brethren. He went to King <HI>James,</HI> and laid the pre|&s;ent Condition of Suffering Friends be|fore him; after &s;ome Con&s;ideration, the King told him, That what concerned him, or came to him of tho&s;e Fines, he very freely and readily would remit: Upon which an Order was granted, to &s;u&s;pend the Rigour of their Pro&s;ecutions. But it &s;eems, when it came out, another Party of People, that were at the <HI>Stern,</HI> called <HI>Roman-Catholicks,</HI> took the Advan|tage
<PB N="202" REF="006833_0112_102A6012C90C0658">to them&s;elves; which was &s;om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Surprize to Friends, who had laboure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in that Service. Here I did &s;ee, they part|ly took the Benefit of that Order to them|&s;elves, (for the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> had been under Sufferings al&s;o upon the &s;aid Statute in tho&s;e Times.) <HI>George Whitehead</HI> hearing that I was in the City (at this Time) came to me, and told me the whole Bu&s;i|ne&s;s; and under&s;tanding that I had Inte|re&s;t with the Earl of <HI>Powis,</HI> who was great with the King, he thought it might be of Service if I did go along with him to the Earl.</P>
<P>So next Morning my Friend <HI>G. White|head</HI> and I went to the Earl of <HI>Powis</HI>'s Hou&s;e in <HI>Lincolns-Inn Fields;</HI> when he under&s;tood that I was come in, he very &s;oon came to me; and when I had ended my Country-Bu&s;ine&s;s with him, I told him, I wanted a little of his Advice, in a Ca&s;e wherein our Friends were great Sufferers, by a Law that was made a|gain&s;t <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and that they were &s;everely whipp'd upon their Backs, by the Statute of 20 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> per</HI> Month, for not coming to hear that which is called <HI>Divine Service;</HI> and I told him, that a Friend of ours had waited upon the King, and had told him the whole State of Things, and that the

Then I de&s;ired of him, &s;ee|ing it was his Advice that we &s;hould go on, and not be di&s;couraged, that he would be plea&s;ed to grant that a Friend of mine might come in and &s;peak with him, who was more able to give him an Account of this Bu&s;ine&s;s than my&s;elf, and who had been with the King to get Relief in this Matter (for <HI>G. W.</HI> &s;taid all this while in an adjacent Room) &s;o he bid me bring him up to him; and when <HI>George</HI> came, he opened the Matter ful|ly to him; and when he did thorough|ly under&s;tand the Matter, he &s;oon got him&s;elf ready, and called for his Coach,
<PB N="204" REF="006833_0113_102A601493F64A60">and bid me come to him at an appointed Time; and he brought an ab&s;olute Or|der from the King, to &s;top all Proceed|ings by Sheriffs and Bailiffs on that Ac|count in the Nation: And in a &s;hort Time the Rage, Envy and Cruelty of &s;uch devouring Men were &s;topp'd; and I know not that any have been troubled or &s;uffered &s;ince upon that Statute: Ble&s;&s;ed be God, that hears the Cries of of the Poor, and Fatherle&s;s, and Wi|dows, and &s;ends Relief to the Afflicted in his own due Time. And this I mu&s;t &s;ay, that the Earl of <HI>Powis</HI> and his Counte&s;s were very ready and willing at all Times to do our Friends any Kind|ne&s;s that lay in their Way, and to help them out of their Troubles and Afflicti|ons; and I am apt to believe they did it con&s;cientiou&s;ly, for there were many of our Friends in &s;everal of their Lord&s;hips hereaways, and the Earl never &s;u&s;tered any of us to be fined for not appearing in any of his Courts upon Juries, or any other Way or Manner.</P>
<P>In the Year 1688. it &s;eemed good to King <HI>James</HI> to put out a Declaration for <HI>Liberty of Con&s;cience,</HI> and order'd the Bi&s;hops to &s;end it to their &s;everal Dio|ce&s;s, that it might be read; there were
<PB N="205" REF="006833_0113_102A601493F64A60">Seven of them who would not read it. Bp. <HI>Lloyd</HI> afore&s;aid was one of them, therefore they were committed to the Tower. Then I rememb'red that which I &s;poke to the Bi&s;hop at his Palace in the Year 1681. when I queried of him, what if another Prince &s;hould ari&s;e, that would impo&s;e &s;omething upon him, that he could not do for Con&s;cience &s;ake! And that Year, when I went to <HI>London,</HI> I went to vi&s;it him in his Troubles; and he &s;aid to me, I often thought of your Words, and I could wi&s;h I were in <HI>Pen|&s;ilvania</HI> now my&s;elf; he told me the Rea&s;on why they could not read the Declaration, &s;aying, It was arbitrary, and not according to Law, and that it was a Matter of Con&s;cience to them; and withal, others were to have their Liberty by it be&s;ides Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;en|ters: He told me al&s;o, that they were put on to do as they had done to Di&s;&s;en|ters; but when I told him of it before, he could not believe it, till it came thus upon them. I had acquainted him for|merly, that I had read a Sermon that was preached to prove the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> to be a fal&s;e Church, becau&s;e &s;he was a per&s;ecuting Church: And now, &s;aid I, the Members of the Church of

The Bi&s;hop &s;aid, They did not con&s;ider nor know it then, as they did now. And after I had &s;taid &s;ome Time with him, I took my Leave of him, and he did kindly acknowledge my Vi&s;it; and after &s;ome Time they were relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>And afterwards the Bi&s;hop came to <HI>Welch-Pool</HI> in the A&s;&s;ize Week, and in the Evening he &s;ent for me to him, to the High-Sheriff's Hou&s;e; there being with him mo&s;t of the Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and Deputy Lieutenants of the County, with many of the Clergy, who were very civil to me. The Bi&s;hop told them, That he &s;ent for me, and that he was more beholding to me, than all the Men in the Dioce&s;s, for I came to vi&s;it him in his Troubles; and he de&s;ired of them to do me all the Kindne&s;s they could, and he would take it as done to him&s;elf. And when Supper was over, the Bi&s;hop and the High-Sheriff (<HI>Edward Vaughan</HI>
<PB N="207" REF="006833_0114_102A601793B68DF8">of <HI>Llangedwin</HI>) took me into a pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Room with them, and there we di&s;cour|&s;ed a little about the Times; and there was &s;ome Report of the coming in of the Prince <HI>Orange,</HI> and in a little Time I had an Account that the Prince was landed, which was great Satisfaction to the Bi|&s;hop; for he &s;aid, there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that Pro&s;ecuted him very c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Life.

<P>And now I think it is worthy to take Notice of the &s;everal Kindne&s;&s;es, upon Ac|count of our Suffering Friends I received from this Bp. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> in his &s;everal Dio|ce&s;&s;es: Whereas we do Record the Hard|heartedne&s;s and Cruelty we found from unmerciful and per&s;ecuting Bi&s;hops and Clergy, and how many they have made Poor, Widows, and Fatherle&s;s, I think it is Ju&s;tice and Equity in us to Record all Mercy, Tenderne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion, we find from tho&s;e that are con&s;cientious and charitable among them: As for In|&s;tance.</P>

Then I told him, I was come moreover in the Behalf of a Pri&s;oner on the &s;ame Ac|count, who&s;e Name was <HI>Richard Da|vies,</HI> near <HI>Ruabon,</HI> in <HI>Denbigh&s;hire;</HI> and he advi&s;ed me to go to the Chancellor (one Dr. <HI>Wynne</HI>) whom I &s;hould find, he &s;aid, a very fair Man; &s;o he called
<PB N="209" REF="006833_0115_102A601B3B8AE798">him to us, and le&s;t us together: And then I took my Leave of the Bi&s;hop, ac|knowledging his Kindne&s;s.

And when the afore|&s;aid Wardens came Home, they reported what Favour I had with the Bi&s;hop, and were troubled thereat; but neither my|&s;elf nor Son-in-law, were ever after trou|bled about tho&s;e Repairs of their Wor|&s;hip-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>At another Time, when I was going to <HI>London,</HI> and vi&s;iting Friends in my Way, I call'd at <HI>Timothy Burberough</HI>'s, at <HI>Aino on the Hill,</HI> in <HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> where I under&s;tood he was gone to Pri&s;on; I enquired the Cau&s;e of his Impri&s;onment, and his Wife told me, The Prie&s;t of the Pari&s;h had left their &s;mall Tythes, and other Tythes, till he thought they a|mounted unto a con&s;iderable Value, and then he came and drove and took away near all that they had, and &s;ent him to <HI>Northampton</HI> Goal, where he had been &s;ometime. I took a Memorandum of it, and when I went to <HI>London,</HI> I thought
<PB N="210" REF="006833_0116_102A601D07AFB278">of the Afflictions and Exerci&s;e of my poor Brother: And my old Friend Bp. <HI>Lloyd</HI> being then at <HI>London,</HI> I went to his Lodgings at <HI>Whitehall;</HI> and I mu&s;t &s;ay, he was very ready to come to me; and after &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e, I laid the di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed Ca&s;e of my Friend <HI>T. B.</HI> afore|&s;aid before him; he an&s;wered, He did not know what to do in it, the Prie&s;t of <HI>Aino</HI> was a Stranger to him, and out of his Dioce&s;s. I told him, If he would be plea&s;ed to write a few Lines to the Bi&s;hop. of <HI>Peterborough</HI> (for it was in that Di|oce&s;s) he might peradventure write a few Lines to the Prie&s;t of <HI>Aino,</HI> to be more moderate and con&s;cientious, in not taking more than the Value of that which he called his Due, and ca&s;ting the poor Man from his Family into Pri&s;on al&s;o. The Ca&s;e I left with the Bi&s;hop, and he took care to &s;end it to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Pe|terborough,</HI> who &s;ent to the Prie&s;t of <HI>Ai|no;</HI> and Bp. <HI>Lloyd</HI> &s;ent the Prie&s;t's An|&s;wer, with a Letter from the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Peterborough</HI> to him&s;elf, in a Letter of his to me near <HI>Welch-pool,</HI> which I took as a great Kindne&s;s and Favour from him.</P>
<P>Not long after this, I went to <HI>London</HI> again, and I called at my Friend <HI>T. Bur|berough</HI>'s, where I found him at Home,
<PB N="211" REF="006833_0116_102A601D07AFB278">being relea&s;ed; he told me the Prie&s;t had &s;ent an Order for him to come Home, and that he came to rea&s;on and di&s;cour&s;e with him. It &s;eems he was not &s;o unkind as he had been formerly.</P>
<P>In the Year 1700, there was a con&s;i|derable Suffering on Friends in <HI>Worce|&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> an Account of which was giv|en me by my Friend <HI>Edward Bourne,</HI> of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> who de&s;ired me to u&s;e my In|tere&s;t with Bi&s;hop <HI>Lloyd</HI> for the Relie&s; of one <HI>John Fowler</HI> and his Mother-in|law, the Widow <HI>Banbury</HI>) who was a Pri&s;oner for Tythe in the out County|pri&s;on in <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and he &s;ent me their whole Ca&s;e: When I under&s;tood it, I found a Concern upon me to make what Ha&s;te I could to the Bi&s;hop, who was then at his Palace at <HI>Hortlebury,</HI> a few Miles from <HI>Bewdley,</HI> I con&s;idered al&s;o what a Suffering our Friend <HI>William San|key</HI> had been under, by one <HI>Vernon,</HI> a cruel, ungodly Prie&s;t of the Pari&s;h he lived in, who had ca&s;t him into Pri&s;on, when he had five or &s;ix &s;mall Children, and his Wife lately dead: He &s;everal Times took from him more than treble the Value of his pretended Due for Tythe. From <HI>Bewdley</HI> I went to <HI>William San|key</HI>'s, and I told him I was to go to the
<PB N="212" REF="006833_0117_102A6020AA79BFB0">Bi&s;hop, and de&s;ired him to go with me. So in the Morning we went together; I enquired for the Bi&s;hop's Secretary, <HI>Francis Evans,</HI> who very lovingly came to us, and brought us in, and &s;aid, He would go to acquaint his Lord that I was there and in a little Time the Bi&s;hop came to us: And after &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e, I told the Bi&s;hop, I was not only come to give him a Vi&s;it, but I was come purpo&s;e|ly from Home, in Behalf of &s;ome Friends of mine, who &s;uffered for Tythe in that Country; and that I was inform'd, that there had been three committed to Pri&s;on in <HI>Worcester</HI> Goal by one <HI>Kerry,</HI> Prie&s;t of <HI>Tredington,</HI> and that two of them were relea&s;ed, and the third remained a Pri|&s;oner: Relea&s;ed, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> how are they relea&s;ed? I told him by the Hand of their great Creator. It &s;eems then, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> they are dead. And the &s;ame Man, &s;aid I, doth pro&s;ecute the Widow of one of them, (viz. <HI>William Banbury</HI>'s) and hath already put her into your Court, for that which her Husband &s;uffered, and died for; and we reckon, that in Com|mon Law, when the Pri&s;oner dies in Pri|&s;on, the Pro&s;ecution cea&s;es. I do not know, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> but the Debt may be paid, but the Charge is not; and I know not
<PB N="213" REF="006833_0117_102A6020AA79BFB0">what to do with that Man, for I hear he is a very covetous Man, and I have no Power over him, but once in three Years; I was lately in my Vi&s;itation there, and had I known this then, I might have done your Friends &s;ome Kindne&s;s. Then I &s;aid to him, If thou wilt be &s;o kind as to write a few Lines to him, and let him know what Complaint is made to thee of him, and how thou art informed, that two of the three which he &s;ent to Pri&s;on are dead; I do not que&s;tion but it might &s;top his Rage and &s;evere Pro&s;ecution a|gain&s;t the poor Widow, if not be a Means to Relea&s;e the other Pri&s;oner. So he bid his Secretary take Notice of it, and put him in Mind to write to him. Then I told him of the Sufferings of <HI>William Sankev,</HI> who was there pre&s;ent, and I de|fired him to give Leave to my Friend to open the Ca&s;e him&s;elf to him, which he did; and then he told how cruel the &s;aid <HI>Vernon</HI> had been to him in ca&s;ting him into Goal, his Wife being dead, and left five or &s;ix &s;mall Children: and he told him, that he had taken from him Goods worth about 12 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR></HI> for abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> or 4 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR></HI> De|mand for Tythe; and abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or 14 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR></HI> worth of Sheep, for the like Demand at another Time; and &s;everal other Cruel|ties
<PB N="214" REF="006833_0118_102A60234AC28C10">he had done him by this uncon&s;cion|able <HI>Vernon.</HI> The Bi&s;hop taking it in|to Con&s;ideration, caus'd his Secretary to draw an Order for him to come there with his Account that was due to him from <HI>William Sankey,</HI> and what he had taken from &s;aid <HI>W. Sankey</HI> towards that Account; and he gave the Order to <HI>W. Sankey</HI> to deliver to the Prie&s;t, and de|&s;ired <HI>William</HI> to be there the Day ap|pointed with the Prie&s;t: So when the Time came, as I was informed, the Prie&s;t went there the Day before to the Bi&s;hop, and <HI>W. Sankey</HI> went the Day ap|pointed: And I was inform'd that the Bi&s;hop &s;hould &s;ay, There was no Help for what was pa&s;t, but he would take Care he &s;hould do &s;o no more to <HI>William Sankey;</HI> I heard that &s;ince that Time, he hath taken it in Kind from him, with more Moderation than before; and I heard that the Bi&s;hop was kind to <HI>W. Sankey</HI> ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>And as for the Pri&s;oner at <HI>Worce&s;ter, John Fowler,</HI> that was one of the Three before mentioned (<HI>Robert Grimes</HI> and <HI>W. Banbury</HI> being dead) he was di&s;charged; and as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Widow <HI>Banbury,</HI> who was &s;everely pro&s;ecuted by the Prie&s;t, intending to get it to an Excommunica|tion,
<PB N="215" REF="006833_0118_102A60234AC28C10">that was &s;topp'd, and &s;he was trou|bled no more.</P>
<P>And at this Time, before I parted with the Bi&s;hop, I told him, That there was a Friend of ours, one <HI>William Cattrill,</HI> that kept School in <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> who was pro&s;ecuted very clo&s;e by &s;ome, for keep|ing School without a Licen&s;e, and they did intend to bring him under an <HI>Ex|communicato Capiendo,</HI> and if he was not plea&s;ed to be kind to him, they would put him to all the Charge and Trouble they could. So the Bi&s;hop bid his Se|cretary take Care about it. So all that I reque&s;ted of the Bi&s;hop at that Time, was friendly and kindly granted me, and Care was taken that they were not trou|bled nor mole&s;ted on them Accounts. Then the Bi&s;hop order'd us to dine there that Day, and we parted friendly and lovingly with him; and he de&s;ired me, when I came that Way, not to be &s;trange to him. From thence I went to <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and gave Friends an Account of my Succe&s;s with the Bi&s;hop: I &s;taid with them a little while, and from thence I went to <HI>Bromyand</HI> and had a Meeting there; &s;o I went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ough Part of <HI>Herefor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hire</HI> to <HI>Lem&s;ter.</HI> And I can ble&s;s and prai&s;e the Name of the Lord,
<PB N="216" REF="006833_0119_102A3847836E0D40">who was with me all along in my Jour|ney, and brought me &s;afe Home to my Wife and Family; and when I gave them an Account of my Journey, they prai&s;ed the Lord with me, who had been my Pre&s;erver and Defender.</P>
<P>In a little Time after, I went for <HI>London,</HI> and being at the Meeting about Friends Sufferings, there was mentioned the Sufferings of Friends in <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> Ca&s;tle by the Dean and Chapter of <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter,</HI> and they had been there for &s;eve|ral Years, though Friends had made In|tere&s;t to get them off, and Friends at <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> u&s;ed their Intere&s;t with the Chancellor, who &s;eemed to be very kind to them; yet, for all that, they could not have them di&s;charged. So when I came down from <HI>London,</HI> I went to the Bi&s;hop at <HI>Worce&s;ter;</HI> he was very free with me, and in a little Time the Chan|cellor came in to us, and the Bi&s;hop gave me to under&s;tand who he was; I told them, I was glad to &s;ee them both toge|ther; for when I was lately in <HI>London,</HI> we had the Sufferings of our Friends in <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> before us, for a &s;mall Matter of Tythe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ledged to belong to the Dean and Chapter of <HI>Worcester;</HI> and di|recting my Di&s;cour&s;e to the Bi&s;hop, I
<PB N="217" REF="006833_0119_102A3847836E0D40">&s;aid, that I thought the Chancellor was not a Stranger to it; for I had heard he had been often &s;olicited on their Behalf. The Chancellor told him, he did under|&s;tand it, and that the&s;e Men were there for an incon&s;iderable Matter; and he &s;aid, he was &s;orry that tho&s;e Men died in <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> becau&s;e in Con&s;cience they could not pay that little Tythe to the Prie&s;t of <HI>Tredington,</HI> and he was afraid the&s;e Men would die there al&s;o, except &s;ome Way was found out for their Re|lea&s;e: And the Bi&s;hop asked, how long they had been there? and I think the Chancellor &s;aid, Four or five Years. So the Bi&s;hop &s;aid, Di&s;charge them, di&s;|charge them; and ordered them to be di&s;|charged without paying any Fees. So after a little Time I parted with the Bi&s;hop and Chancellor, and acknowledged their Kindne&s;s: And I went to Friends in the City of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and told <HI>William Pardoe</HI> what Succe&s;s I had with the Bi|&s;hop, and de&s;ired him to wait on the Chancellor to get the Order, that it might be &s;ent &s;peedlly: And in a little Time I heard they were di&s;charged.</P>
