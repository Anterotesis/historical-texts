<HEAD>TO THE <HI>READER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THAT the be&s;t People may &s;oon <HI>de|generate,</HI> is a Truth abundantly evi|dent from the Cautions, Threat|nings, and Hi&s;tories of the Word of GOD, without appealing to the Ex|perience of all Ages. And that <HI>this People</HI> have &s;adly done &s;o, cannot but be own'd by every one who knows any thing of <HI>New-England's fir&s;t Ways,</HI> and has his Mind at all exercis'd to di&s;|cern things of this Nature. It is al&s;o as evident that GOD hath been <HI>re&s;tifying</HI> again&s;t our Apo&s;ta|cy, &amp; puni&s;hing us therefore, in a <HI>Series</HI> of various &amp; very awful Judgments. Our <HI>fir&s;t</HI> days, as they were our <HI>be&s;t</HI> in re&s;pect of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y, &s;o al&s;o of Pro&s;pe|rity. Our Fathers indeed met with their Trials in their day; their GOD did prove and chatted them: But &s;till He was remarkably pre&s;ent with them; the Hand of his Mercy, and the Arm of his Power, were often made bare, for their Delive|rance; and <HI>his Salvation was openly &s;hewed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;ight of the Heath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n. They trusted in him, and were
<PB N="ii" REF="002530_0003_0FDB5DD5972D3658">not confounded; they cried to him, &amp; were delivered. He an&s;wered them by terrible things in Righteou&s;|ne&s;s</HI> upon their Enemies. They have told us what GOD did for them in their day, in the time of old; and we &s;hould &s;peak of it to our Gene|ration, and to tho&s;e that &s;hall come after us, that our Fathers GOD may be exalted.</P>
<P>BUT as there has been a vi&s;ible Alteration in our Carriage to him of later Years, &s;o there has been a &s;ignal Change in the Cour&s;e of his Providence towards us; which may cau&s;e us to take up this mournful Lamentation, <HI>Oh that it were with us as in</HI> Years <HI>pa&s;t, as in the days <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> God pre&s;erved us: When the Candle</HI> of his Providence <HI>&s;hined upon our heads, and by his light we walked thro' darkne&s;s!</HI> For tho' there are not wanting many In&s;tances of the under&s;erved Favour of GOD to us, and &s;ome gracious An|&s;wers of Prayer (particularly in the late remar|kable Succe&s;&s;es again&s;t the Enemy, and in the return of fruitful Sea&s;ons, after a threatning Drought) which it would he a criminal Ingra|titude and Stupidity in us not to take a thankfull Notice of; yet it mu&s;t be &s;aid. We have not &s;uch <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed</HI> Appearances of GOD with aim for us, as our Fathers had; and the Tokens of his Di&s;plea&s;ure are to be read in deep and fiery Characters: It mu&s;t be a &s;leepy, or rather dead Eye, that does not &s;ee them, and a hard heart that is not affected with them.</P>
<P>NOW that which GOD expects of us is, That we be HUMBLED, that we FEAR,
<PB N="iii" REF="002530_0004_0FDB5DD71466DEB0">and turn our feet to <HI>walk in his Law, and is his St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tes, which he has &s;et before us, and before our Fathers. This</HI> is the Call of the pre&s;ent day: Highly rea&s;onable in it &s;elf, and of the la&s;t Con&s;equence to us: For it is the only likely Way to obtain the Removal of the Judgments, under which we are langui&s;hing, and the Return of GOD's Favour to us in which our whole Happine&s;s is bound up. This the Nature of the Duty, the Commands and Promi&s;es of GOD in his Word, and the Experiences of the People of GOD do abundantly prove.</P>
<P>AND <HI>this</HI> is what we are call'd to in the fol|lowing <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e;</HI> wherein the Nature of this Duty is plainly and fully de&s;cribed, and, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Motive to it, the fatal Con&s;equence of our In|corrigiblene&s;s under Divine Judgments is awfully repre&s;ented. The <HI>Lecture Day</HI> before that on which it was deliver'd, was turn'd into a day of &s;olemn <HI>Fa&s;ting &amp; Prayer,</HI> particularly on account of the War, and the Drought which was then prevailing: And the Author well Judg'd it pro|per to follow that day with &s;uch a Di&s;cour&s;e as this. And I de&s;ire heartily to ble&s;s GOD who led his Servant into &s;uch a Subject, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted his Preparations on it; gave the Sermon &s;uch Acceptance and Influence in the Delivery, and has inclin'd him to publi&s;h it.</P>
<P>IT comes abroad (at the De&s;ire of &s;ome pious and well-di&s;pos'd Per&s;ons who heard it) ju&s;t as it was preach'd; without tran&s;cribing or altering much: only he has (as he was de&s;ir'd) inlarg'd

And tho' I know it was not the de&s;ign of my <HI>dear and worthy Brother,</HI> in asking me to preface this his Sermon, that I &s;hould give any <HI>Encomium</HI> of him or his Perfor|mance, which, (as he does not need it from any one, &s;o) it would not be decent for me to go about; yet I will take the Liberty to &s;ay, that as the Subject is important, and very &s;ea&s;onable for this People at this day, &s;o it is handled in &s;uch a manner as evidently &s;hews the Breathings of a pious Spirit, and a hearty Concern for the great Intere&s;t of this People; and, I think, it cannot fail of being highly acceptable to every true Lover of Religion, and &s;incere Friend of our <HI>Zien.</HI> And as to my putting a Preface to it, (which &s;ome perhaps may think needs an Ex|cu&s;e) I &s;hall only &s;ay, That this my Brother and I, are not only united in the Bonds of Friend|&s;hip and Intimacy, but in carrying on <HI>alternately</HI> the la&s;t Turn in the <HI>Thur&s;day-Lecture:</HI> This made me think with him there would be but a Propriety and Harmony in it, if I &s;ubmitted to the De&s;ires of Him, and the Publi&s;hers, to ac|company it to the Pre&s;s with my humble and earn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t Prayers to the GOD of all Grace, that He would make the&s;e &s;ea&s;onable and pungent Words, <HI>as G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ads, and as Nails fastned by the Ma&s;ters of A&s;&s;emb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, and given by that one Shep|herd the Lord Je&s;us;</HI> that they may &s;timulate all that &s;hall read them, to the great and nece&s;|&s;ary

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_JEREMIAH was called early to be a Teacher in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> an in&s;pired Prophet: And he continu'd long, even from the Days of good <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> through all the &s;ucceeding wicked Reigns, down to the <HI>Jews</HI> Captivity, and for &s;ome time after this. He is commonly &s;tyled the <HI>weeping</HI> Prophet. He was a mournful Spectator of the Sins and Sorrows of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation, then the
<PB N="2" REF="002530_0009_0FDB5DE41B133E70">only profe&s;&s;ing People of God. In his Book of Prophecies we have many melancholy Chapters concerning them; be&s;ides the Book of Lamen|tations, which was (as one calls it) his Elegy upon <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>'s Funeral. He was &s;ent to warn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ack&s;liding <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of the de&s;olating Judgments, that were coming on them, except they Repent|ed: And he liv'd to &s;ee a great part of his &s;ad Predictions accompli&s;h'd upon them: for the Peo|ple turned not at his Reproof. As became a faithful Prophet, a Lover of <HI>Zion,</HI> and one jea|lous for the Lord, he &s;et him&s;elf to bear Te&s;ti|mony again&s;t the growing Degeneracies of that unhappy Day, and to reform the Corruptions of the Times. How painful were his Endeavours! How fervent his Applications to Con&s;cience! How impartial his Rebukes! How loud and plain his Warnings? How pathetic and moving his Exhortations! A wi&s;e, and zealous &amp; powerful Preacher he was. And yet (O how &s;orrowful the Thought) it &s;eems he had but very <HI>little Succe&s;s</HI> in his Mini&s;try. He liv'd among a Peo|ple that <HI>hated to be Reform'd,</HI> and that <HI>would not be heal'd.</HI> Neverthele&s;s the Prophet, in preach|ing the Word, was <HI>in&s;tant in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on; rebuk'd, reprov'd, exhorted with all Long-&s;uffering, and Doctrine.</HI> After <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was made de&s;olate, and the Body of the Nation were carry'd Captive to <HI>Babylon,</HI> He remain'd Prophe&s;ying to the &s;mall Remnant, that were &s;uffer'd to abide &s;till in the Land. And when this ungrateful wicked Remnant de&s;erted their own Land, and compe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'d <HI>Jeremiah</HI> to go down with them into <HI>Egypt;</HI> He &s;till attended the
<PB N="3" REF="002530_0010_0FDB5DE560008CF8">Duties of a Prophet, and did the be&s;t Services he could for his Countrymen there.</P>
<P>THIS forty fourth Chapter of his Book, out of which I have taken my Text, begins with an awakning Sermon, which <HI>Jeremiah</HI> preach'd to the Jews in <HI>Egypt.</HI> Wherein the Prophet fir&s;t reminds them of tho&s;e de&s;olating Judgments, that were brought upon <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and upon them&s;elves. Then he ob&s;erves to them the procuring Cau&s;e of their Mi&s;eries, <HI>viz.</HI> Their own Wickedne&s;s. In the next place, he puts them in mind of the Warnings they had had, and the Pains that God had taken with them to bring them to Repen|tance; upbraids them with their former Ob&s;ti|nacy in their own Land, and with the fatal Con|&s;equents of it; upbraids them with their conti|nu'd Impenitency and repeated Idolatries now in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and expo&s;tulates with them upon the Un|rea&s;onablene&s;s and Madne&s;s of their Conduct; and finally threa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ens them with a total De|&s;truction, for their incurable Stubborne&s;s and Impenitence.</P>
<P>MY Text takes in part of the two la&s;t Heads. And in it we have a Charge and a Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eatning.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, HERE is a Charge upon the Jews. <HI>They are not humbled, even unto this Day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my Law.</HI> &amp;c. They were not humbled for their Sins, is they ought to have been, and as God expected; nor afraid of his Judgments; neither did they turn from their evil ways unto God's Te&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">monies, notwith&s;tanding all the Methods u&s;ed with them to that end. This is the Charge advanc'd again&s;t them, the Complaint &s;ighed over them,</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002530_0011_0FDB5DEA22AF16E0">
THEN a Threatning follows. <HI>Therefore, thus &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the God of I&s;rael, Behold, I will &s;et my face again&s;t you for Evil.</HI> They had &s;et their faces to go into the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> in a daring Contradiction to the revealed Will of GOD, and had hardn'd their faces again&s;t GOD, in ways of Rebellion and Wickedne&s;s: and therefore GOD will al&s;o &s;et his face again&s;t Them, in ways of Judgment, to puni&s;h them for all their Iniquities.</P>
<P>WHAT may be further needful for the Ex|planation of the words, may be given in &s;peak|ing to the Doctrines that I de&s;ign to treat upon, which are the&s;e. (1.) GOD expects it of a Peo|ple under his Judgments, that they <HI>humble them|&s;elves,</HI> and <HI>fear,</HI> and <HI>walk in his Law.</HI> (2.) It is &s;ometimes the &s;ad Ca&s;e of a People under Divine Rebukes that they <HI>continue,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding all, <HI>unhumbled,</HI> and <HI>unreformed.</HI> (3.) GOD <HI>ob&s;erves their Conduct</HI> under his Judgments, and <HI>marks</HI> again&s;t them all their Ob&s;tinacy and Im|penitency. (4.) When a People are finally irre|clamable, GOD <HI>will &s;et his Face again&s;t Them for Evil.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. I. <HI>GOD expects it of a People under his corrective Hand, that they humble them&s;elves, and fear, and turn their Feet unto His Te&s;ti|monies, to walk in his Law.</HI></P>
<P>HERE are Three comprehen&s;ive Articles of Duty, which might all be profitably expatiated upon.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002530_0012_0FDB5DEB5AF3B438">
PROP. I. <HI>A People under GOD's Judgment's &s;hould</HI> humble <HI>Them&s;elves.</HI> The Complaint in our Text, <HI>They have not humbled them&s;elves,</HI> &s;heweth GOD's Expectation of it from them; and this mu&s;t be founded upon the &s;tronge&s;t Rea|&s;ons, and the Demands of his own Law. The Call of GOD to an afflicted People runs in &s;uch Language as that, Jam. 4.9, 10. <HI>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your Laughter be turned to Mourning, and your Joy to Heavine&s;s. Humble your &s;elves in the &s;ight of God.</HI> It is expre&s;ly <HI>required</HI> by many Divine Precepts, that we hum|ble our &s;elves under GOD's Judgments; which &s;peaks it our indi&s;pen&s;able Duty. And then the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of things be&s;peak it at out hands. The Calamities we are groaning under, do loudly preach to us of the Power of GOD, of his Holine&s;s and Ju&s;tice, his Di&s;plea&s;ure at us for our Sins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are &s;o many grounds and motives of Humiliation. Hence it is but <HI>our rea&s;onable Service,</HI> and a ju&s;t Comportment with our State and Circum&s;tances. Moreover this will be our <HI>Safety</HI> and <HI>Intere&s;t.</HI> If we are truly humbled, it will di&s;po&s;e us to &s;eek to GOD, and to engage in a &s;aving, thorow, and la&s;ting work of Reformation; and &s;o give ground to hope for, and prepare us to receive the Salva|tions, which GOD has promis'd to a reforming and repenting People. <HI>GOD will not forget the humble;</HI> the Poor of the Flock &s;hall tru&s;t in Him: They &s;hall tru&s;t in Him, and <HI>ly down in in Safety.</HI> They &s;hall <HI>rejoice</HI> in the Holy One of I&s;rael, and &s;hall <HI>tread down the Haughty under their feet.</HI> When once a People are brought to
<PB N="6" REF="002530_0013_0FDB5DECEEC9F378">humble them&s;elves under GOD's Judgments, it bodes Deliverance, and pre&s;ages the return of good Times. According to that of the Apo&s;tle, 1 Pet. 5.5, 6, 7. <HI>Be clothed with humility: for GOD re&s;i&s;teth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble your &s;elves therefore under the mighty hand of GOD, that he may exalt you in due time: Ca&s;ting all your care upon him, for be careth for you.</HI></P>
<P>BUT here the Inquiry ari&s;es, <HI>What is that hum|bling them&s;elves,</HI> which GOD expects from a Peo|ple under the Rebukes of his Providence. To which I an&s;wer, it implies &s;omething inward, in the Heart, and &s;omthing external, in the Life.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT may be con&s;ider'd as <HI>internal,</HI> in the Heart; and &s;o it implies many gracious Di&s;po|&s;itions and Actings of Soul. And indeed it is this inward Humiliation, that is principally in|tended. For GOD looks at the <HI>Heart</HI> chiefly. The Sacrifices of GOD
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.17.</NOTE> are a <HI>broken Spirit,</HI> and a <HI>contrite Heart.</HI> To this Man will I look, &s;aith the Lord
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;a.</HI> 66.2.</NOTE>, even to him that is <HI>Poor,</HI> &amp; <HI>of a con|trite Spirit.</HI> The Lord &s;eeth not as Man &s;eeth
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 16.7.</NOTE>: for Man looketh on the <HI>outward A&s;pearance,</HI> but the Lord looketh on <HI>the Heart.</HI> And if we be not of a humble <HI>Spirit,</HI> we do not truly humble our &s;elves <HI>in the &s;ight of GOD.</HI> To humble our &s;elves outwardly, and in the fight of <HI>Men</HI> only, will not &s;uffice: we mu&s;t humble our&s;elves in the &s;ight of GOD al&s;o. The Heart mu&s;t be humbled: and this includes a variety of religious Frames, &amp; devout Affections; which I &s;hall en|deavour to &s;um up in the following heads.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002530_0014_0FDB5DEE53F1AAC8">
Fir&s;t, IT implys, as the foundation of it, a deep <HI>Conviction of Guilt,</HI> the fruit of a thorow Self-examination, and impartial Self-judging. Un|der the Judgments of GOD, it becomes a People to judge them&s;elves. We &s;hou'd &s;earch our Hearts, and try our Ways, to find out the pro|voking Evils, that are the unhappy Grounds of GOD's Controver&s;y with us. GOD expects to hear us inquiring every one, (as in Jer. 8.6.) <HI>What have I done?</HI> We mu&s;t be very accurate, impar|tial, and th&ocirc;r&ocirc;w in this Inquiry; willing to know the wor&s;t of our &s;elves, the mo&s;t of our guilt.

<P>IN the next place, being thus convinced and condemn'd in our &s;elves, there mu&s;t be a deep <HI>Self-aba&s;ement, Shame,</HI> &amp; <HI>Remor&s;e</HI> of Con&s;cience, an holy <HI>Indignation</HI> at our &s;elves, and a humble <HI>Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> to the Will of GOD.</P>

While we pretend to humble our &s;elves for one Sin, (a Sin, which perhaps thr&ocirc; &s;atiety, or &s;ome evil effects felt, is become grievous and irk&s;ome to us) we mu&s;t not rejoice in another, that is more agreeable to our Humour, or appears

Dan. 9, 7, 8. <HI>O Lord, Righteou&s;|ne&s;s belongeth unto Thee: but unto us Confu&s;ion of face, as at this day! to the Men of Judah, and to the Inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem, and unto all I&s;rael that are near, and that are afar off: to our Kings,

<P>AND now in con&s;equence of this Shame and Sorrow for Sin, there mu&s;t be an holy <HI>Indignati|on</HI> at our&s;elves. We mu&s;t conceive a Di&s;plea|&s;ure at our &s;elves, like the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Penitents, in whom the Apo&s;tle commends this Self Indig|nation as a fruit and argument of their godly Sorrow. 2 Cor. 7.11. <HI>Behold, this &s;elf-&s;ame thing that ye &s;orrowed after a godly &s;ort, what carefulne&s;s it wrought in you; yea, what clearing of your &s;elves; yea, what Indignation; &mdash; yea, what Revenge!</HI> If we are truly penitent, our Hearts will be hot within us, in re&s;entment of our Follies: a holy, Anger at our &s;elves will kindle in our Brea&s;ts, and Con&s;cience will &s;tir up it &s;elf to &s;courge and &s;mite us.</P>
<P>FURTHER MORE, where there is a true Hu|miliation under GOD's Hand, there will be a chearful <HI>Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> to his Will in all the afflictive Di&s;pen&s;ations that befall us. This is made one &s;ign and character of a due Humiliation, Lev. 26.41. <HI>If then their uncircumci&s;ed Hearts be humb|led, and they then accept of the Puni&s;hment of their Iniquity; then will I remember my Covenant with Ja|cob. &amp;c.</HI> So Lam. 3.27, &amp;c. <HI>It is good for a Man, that he hear the yoke in his youth. He &s;itteth alone, and keepeth &s;ilence, becau&s;e he hath born it upon him.

<PB N="12" REF="002530_0019_0FDB5DFCDA51D2D0">in any way of Murmuring or Complaint. We mu&s;t not &s;tout and brave it again&s;t GOD; nor exalt our &s;elves again&s;t the Lord, and de&s;pi&s;e his Cha&s;tnings, and &s;trive with our Maker; as they did, of whom we read, I&s;a. 9.9, 10. They <HI>&s;ay in the pride and &s;toutne&s;s of heart. The Bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn &s;tones: the Sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into Cedars.</HI> Far from us be &s;uch a Spirit and Carriage. The Temper &amp; Conduct of holy <HI>Job</HI> becomes us in all our Afflictions, who &s;aid (Chap. 40.4.) <HI>Behold, I am vile! What &s;hall I an&s;wer Thee? I will lay my hand upon my Mouth.</HI> So the P&s;almi&s;t &s;aid (P&s;al. 39.9) <HI>I was dumb; I opened not my mouth: becau&s;e Thou did&s;t it.</HI></P>
<P>AND as there mu&s;t be a meek &amp; patient Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to GOD under all his dealings with us; &s;o where there is this, there will (and ought to) be <HI>a thankful Notice</HI> taken of the <HI>Mercies</HI> mixed with Divine Judgments and a due &s;en&s;e of our own Unworthine&s;s. That will be the humble di&s;po&s;ition and Language of our Souls, Ezr. 9.13 <HI>After all that is come upon us, for our evil Deeds, Thou our God ha&s;t puni&s;hed us le&s;s than our Iniquities de&s;erve.</HI> And (Gen. 32.10.) <HI>I am not worthy of the least of all the Mercies, and of all the Truth, which thou bast &s;hewed unto thy &s;ervant.</HI></P>
<P>IN a word, there will al&s;o be the exerci&s;e of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> in GOD, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the Pardon of Sin, the removal of the Grounds of GOD's Controver&s;y with us, and putting a happy Period unto it.

It is good that a Man &s;hould both hope and qui|etly wait for the Salvation of GOD. Tru&s;t in the Lord at all times, O ye People, pour out your Hearts before Him: GOD is a Refuge for us, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Fly for refuge, to lay hold on the Hope &s;et before you. I&s;a. 50.10. <HI>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obey|eth the voice of his &s;ervant, that walketh in darkne&s;s, and hath no light? let him tru&s;t in the name of the Lord, &amp; &s;tay upon his God.</HI> Thus &s;aid the Church of old, I&s;a. 26.8. <HI>In the way of thy Judgments, O Lord, have we waited for Thee.</HI> So the Prophet <HI>Micah,</HI> in the Church's Name, Chap. 7.7, 8, 9. <HI>Therefore I will look unto the Lord: I will wait for the God of my Salvation: my God will hear me.

We mu&s;t labour to cru|cify the Fle&s;h, to mortify the Members that are upon the Earth, that the Body of Sin may be de&s;troy'd, that hence forth we may not &s;erve Sin.

In a time of public Judgments, if a People wou'd humble them&s;elves aright, it becomes them to ob&s;erve many &s;olemn Days of Fa&s;ting and Humiliation. That is the Call of GOD to them, Joel 1.14. <HI>Sancti&s;y ye a fa&s;t, call a &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly, gather the elders, and all the inhabitants of the land into the hou&s;e of the Lord your GOD, and cry unto the Lord.</HI> And as it follows in the next Chapter, <HI>Turn to the Lord with all your Heart, and with Fa&s;ting, &amp; with Weeping, and with Mourning.</HI> Thus <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> humbled him&s;elf, 2 Chron. 34.27. <HI>Thine Heart was tender, and thou didst humble thy &s;elf before GOD, and did&s;t rend thy clothes and weep be|fore me.</HI> So we read of <HI>Ninevites,</HI> (Jon. 3.5, 6.) <HI>So the people of Nineveh believed GOD, and pro|claimed a fa&s;t, and put on &s;ackloth, from the greate&s;t of them even to the lea&s;t of them.

He ob&s;erves Men's Conduct at all times, in all places, and under all his dealings with them.

<P>NOW this <HI>O &s;ervation</HI> is in order to <HI>Judgment</HI> upon their Conduct, and the &s;uting GOD's fur|ther Di&s;pen&s;ations to their Ca&s;e. For He does not act therein as a carele&s;s, indifferent Specta|tor of Human Affairs, but as the Lord &amp; Judge of the World.

2. HE will &s;et his Face again&s;t them <HI>for Evil.</HI> He will not only withdraw his Favour from them, but will pour out his Indignation upon them.

His Heart is turned from them, &amp; his Pre&s;ence gone, which is the Safety and Happine&s;s, the Strength and Glory of a People.

<P>WE may confirm this Argument from the many known <HI>Examples</HI> of Divine Vengeance. There have been &s;ad and lamentable In&s;tances of a People's being ruin'd by their Iniquity, and Provoking GOD to Anger, till He has &s;et his

The Jewi&s;h Nation, for crucifying the Lord of Glory, were rejected of GOD from being any more his People, and their City, and Land made an utter De&s;olation.

<P>AND now, as to the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> and Foundations of GOD's judicial proceedings with any People, e&s;pecially a profe&s;&s;ing People, they &s;eem to be very clear &amp; obvious. The <HI>Honour</HI> of his own Name calls for &s;uch a Conduct towards an impe|nitent People. His Glory is e&s;pecially concern'd in the matter; the Glory of his Holine&s;s, and of his Faithfulne&s;s, and Wi&s;dom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He &s;eems bound in Honour to tho&s;e Attributes, to witne&s;s again&s;t the Apo&s;tacys of his People, by inflicting Judgments upon them. Otherwi&s;e His Name will peculiarly &s;uffer by their Wickedne&s;s and Impenitence. Hence He tells I&s;rael of old, Amos 3.2. <HI>You only have I known of all the Families of the earth: therefore I will puni&s;h you for all your ini|quities.</HI></P>
<P>IN a word, The Honour of Divine <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> re|quires the puni&s;hing a &s;inful People, and de&s;troy|ing them, if finally impenitent. Will not the Judge of all the Earth do right? Is there any Iniquity with GOD? Will he not render to every Man according to his Work? And to every Peo|ple according to the fruit of their Doings? Verily He will render a Reward to the Proud. There is no Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in Him. As He is oblig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in Ju&s;tice, He will not let a rebellious People goun|puni&s;h'd.
<PB N="43" REF="002530_0050_0FDB5E4796A65AE8">Indeed as to <HI>Individuals</HI> or particular Per&s;ons, there may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ome Exceptions, during the pre&s;ent State: Some Sinners may have almo&s;t all their Puni&s;hment re&s;erv'd to the future World: But if we con&s;ider Men as united in <HI>Society,</HI> and making up di&s;tinct Provinces, Kingdoms and Nations, we &s;hall find the Con|duct of God's Providence towards them is va&s;tly different in this particular. <HI>National Guilts in|fer National Judgments.</HI> God exerci&s;es a Go|vernment over Men, as they coale&s;ce into di&s;tinct Communities P&s;al. 22.28. <HI>For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the governour among the nati|ons.</HI> And his Government is infinitely wi&s;e, and good, and ju&s;t, and holy. He governs them by Law and Rule: And He judges them according to their doings. Now methinks, we mu&s;t have very odd notions of Things, if we imagine that human <HI>Societies,</HI> as &s;uch, have any reference to the future State, or can be judged in another World. Hence, if ever God puni&s;h them, it mu&s;t be in the pre&s;ent State. Divine Ju&s;tice &s;eems more concern'd then to puni&s;h <HI>Nations,</HI> than <HI>Per|&s;ons,</HI> in the Life that now is.</P>
<P>GOD <HI>can</HI> puni&s;h whole Nations as ea&s;ily as particular Per&s;ons. He has National Judgments; Puni&s;hments of a publick A&s;pect and general Con|cern. And if a People fin, they lay them&s;elves open to &s;uch Judgments. And if they are finally impenitent, Divine Ju&s;tice calls a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oud for their utter De&s;truction. When a People are ob&s;tinate and irreclamable, after a long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me of Trial and much waiting upon them, God repre&s;ents him|&s;elf as weary with repenting, and oblig'd to pro|ceed
<PB N="44" REF="002530_0051_0FDB5F1993A64600">to their De&s;truction. Jer. 15.5, 6. <HI>For who &s;hall have pity upon thee, O Jeru&s;alem? or who &s;hall bemoan thee? or who &s;hall go a&s;ide to ask how thou doest? Thou ha&s;t for&s;aken me, &s;aith the Lord, thou art gone backward: therefore will I &s;tretch out my hand again&s;t thee, and de&s;troy thee: I am weary with repenting.</HI>&mdash;He may <HI>very ju&s;tly</HI> do &s;o. For exceeding aggravated is the Provocation that &s;uch a People offer unto God; very great the Affronts they put upon Him. It is the highe&s;t In&s;tance of <HI>Stubborne&s;s</HI> and Rebellion again&s;t God, to be incorrigible, and unhumbled, under very humbling Di&s;pen&s;ations, and not afraid of the Con&s;equence. It is in effect a <HI>bidding Defiance</HI> to God, a challenging his Vengeance to do it's ut|mo&s;t. 'Tis the highe&s;t <HI>In&s;olence</HI> and Contempt of God, and mu&s;t needs be extremely provoking to Him. He may well therefore &s;et his Face again&s;t &s;uch a Rebellious People. Shall not God vi&s;it &s;uch a Nation as this?</P>
<P>MOREOVER, It <HI>defeats the De&s;ign</HI> of Provi|dence, in afflictive Di&s;pen&s;ations. The great End ordinarily is to bring a People to Repentance: and for this purpo&s;e, Divine Judgments are or|dinarily for a long while temper'd with much Mercy, that by the Goodne&s;s of God we may be led to Repentance. It his method to try a Peo|ple by le&s;s and lighter Judgments at fir&s;t; and if the&s;e are ineffectual, he brings greater and hea|vier. And if after all they will walk contrary to God, and will not be reformed by the&s;e Things, but defeat his gracious De&s;ign by a per&s;evering Impenitence; how rea&s;onably, how ju&s;tly may his abu&s;ed Patience turn into flaming Indignation?
<PB N="45" REF="002530_0052_0FDB5E4D199679E0">His Anger may well burn again&s;t them, and his Fury be pour'd out like Fire, to con&s;ume them ut|terly! <HI>When a People have out-&s;tood all the Me|thods of Reformation, they are completely ripe for Ruin.</HI> They have fill'd up the mea&s;ure of their Iniquity: they have provoked GOD to the la&s;t de|gree.

<P>BUT now to <HI>apply</HI> this Doctrine in a few Hims.</P>
<P>USE 1. <HI>THIS affords a &s;ad</HI> Progn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tick <HI>to a People that have</HI> long <HI>continu'd</HI> Impenitent <HI>under a Cour&s;e of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ictive Di&s;pen&s;ations.</HI></P>
<P>IT tells us, They are like to have the ble&s;&s;ed GOD &s;et his Face again&s;t them. If they are re|&s;olv'd upon Sinning, He is re&s;olv'd upon Puni&s;h|ing. GOD is jealous, and the Lord revengeth: the Lord will take Vengeance on his Adver&s;aries, and He re&s;erveth Wrath for his Enemies. Tho' He be &s;low to Anger; yet He will not at all acquit the Wicked. How mi&s;erable then are a People, &s;ecure and &s;tupid under many Judgments, like to be in the I&s;&s;ue! They mu&s;t expect the Con|tinuance and Aggravation of their Calamities. There's no pro&s;pect of any Period to their Trou|bles; unle&s;s GOD is pleas'd to have done &s;triving with them: and that is the mo&s;t
<PB N="46" REF="002530_0053_0FDB5E4E5A2EC628">formidable Judgment in the World. Indeed &s;ometimes Sovereign Divine Grace is exalted and triumphs in the Conver&s;ion of a Per&s;on or a Peo|ple, after they have long &s;tood it out again&s;t all means. I&s;ai. 57.17, 18. <HI>I was wroth &amp; &s;mote him; I hid me and was wroth: and be went on frowardly in the way of his heart. I have &s;een his ways, and will heal him.</HI> But this is an extraordinary Ca&s;e. If we con&s;ider the common Cour&s;e of Providence, and the con&s;tant Tenour of the Covenant, They both (with united voices) read Lectures of Ter|ror, and &s;peak &s;adly, to &s;uch a People. From hence <HI>We</HI> may learn, <HI>What we have to fear,</HI> if we do not repent, and turn to GOD. We have &s;in|ned: and GOD hath a Controver&s;y with us: Tho' hitherto he has dealt very tenderly &amp; com|pa&s;&s;ionately with us; in wrath remembring Mer|cy. But if we go on &s;till in our Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, we mu&s;t expect GOD will heap on us more &s;evere and heavy Judgments, than ever yet we have felt. We may expect fearful Tragedies to be acted on the Stage, before GOD has performed His work, whether it be of Mercy or of Vengeance.</P>
<P>USE 2. <HI>WHAT has been &s;aid may help to ac|count for tho&s;e dark Appearances of Providence, wherein GOD &s;eems to be &s;etting his Face a|gain&s;t this People, at this day.</HI></P>
<P>WE are fallen by our Iniquity: GOD has vi&s;i|ted our Sins upon us from time to time, by Scar|city, by epidemical Sickne&s;&s;es, by War in our Borders, Piracies at Sea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By various Judgments we have many times been brought low. And how are our common Calamities grown &amp; aggravated
<PB N="47" REF="002530_0054_0FDB5E4FD735B238">at this day! It is in many re&s;pects a time of <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Trouble. It is particularly a day of <HI>Battel &amp; War,</HI> wherein we are frequently made to bleed by the Sword of the Wilderne&s;s: and a &s;corching &s;ea&s;on, wherein GOD is with-holding the <HI>Rain</HI> of Hea|ven, and making the Rain of our Land powder and du&s;t. Our di&s;tre&s;s &amp; perplexity is great on the&s;e accounts, and others. And GOD &s;eems to be threatning us with greater Calamities. The pre|&s;ent A&s;pects of Providence upon us in our mo&s;t important Intere&s;ts, how frowning are they! Above all the too &s;en&s;ible Withdraw of the Spirit of GOD from among us, affords the mo&s;t awful Symptom, that GOD is &s;etting his Face again&s;t us.</P>
<P>AND what is the ground of all? Why, <HI>becau&s;e we are not humbled, even to this day.</HI> The People turneth not to Him that &s;miteth them: and therefore his Anger is not turned away, but his Hand is &s;tretched out &s;till; notwith&s;tanding the many days of Humiliation we have &s;olemnized. I de&s;ire to lay my hand on my own Brea&s;t in the fir&s;t place: but &s;uffer me to &s;ay, Doubtle&s;s we have <HI>in general</HI> too much rea&s;on to condemn our &s;elves, as the faulty Cau&s;es of our own Di&s;tre&s;&s;es: It is becau&s;e we are &s;till unreform'd, that GOD will not put an End to his Controver&s;y with us.</P>
<P>USE 3. <HI>LET us &s;ee &amp; admire the Patience of GOD towards us in this Land.</HI></P>
<P>O the Riches of the Patience, &amp; Forbearance of GOD; who, tho' He has not &s;uffer'd us to go unpuni&s;ht, yet has <HI>debated with us in mea&s;ure,</HI> and <HI>stay'd his Rough Wind</HI> in the day of the Ea&s;t Wind.
<PB N="48" REF="002530_0055_0FDB5E54C754E078">A great many Mercies have been mingled with his Judgments. He hath not rewarded us accor|ding to our Iniquities. He hath not in anger &s;hut up his Bowels, but is long-&s;uffering to us|ward, not willing that we &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to Repentance. Indeed He is awfully contending with us by various Judg|ments, avenging the Quarrel of his violated Co|venant; and is making progre&s;s in his Contro|ver&s;y with us: yet He takes but very &s;low Steps, and makes many Pau&s;es, giving us a <HI>Space to re|pent,</HI> and <HI>waiting to be gracious.</HI> Surely He is a GOD &s;low to Anger, long-&s;uffering, and abundant in Goodne&s;s &amp; Mercy.

<P>USE 4. WHAT has been &s;aid <HI>warns us to beware of continu'd Impenitency, and calls upon us to humble our &s;elves in the &s;ight of GOD,</HI> le&s;t He be provoked to abandon us utterly.</P>

Why &s;hould we oblige Him to inflict heavier Judgments upon us! O let us not be &s;o egre|giou&s;ly fooli&s;h!
