<HEAD>THE INTEREST OF GREAT BRITAIN, CONSIDERED With Regard to Her COLONIES.</HEAD>
<P>I Have peru&s;ed with no &s;mall plea&s;ure the <HI>Letter addre&s;&s;ed to Two Great Men,</HI> and the <HI>Remarks</HI> on that letter. It is not merely from the beauty, the force and per&s;picuity of expre&s;&s;ion, or the general elegance of manner con&s;picuous in both pamphlets, that my plea&s;ure chiefly ari&s;es; it is ra|ther from this, that I have lived to &s;ee &s;ubjects of the greate&s;t importance to this nation publickly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed without party views, or party heat, with decency and politene&s;s, and with no other warmth than what a zeal for the honour and happine&s;s of our king and country may in&s;pire;&mdash;and this by writers who&s;e under&s;tanding (however they may differ from each other) appears not unequal to their candour and the uprightne&s;s of their intention.</P>
<P>But, as great abilities have not always the be&s;t information, there are, I apprehend, in the <HI>Remarks</HI> &s;ome opinions not well founded, and &s;ome mi&s;|takes of &s;o important a nature, as to render a few ob&s;ervations on them nece&s;&s;ary for the better in|formation of the publick.</P>
<P>The author of the <HI>Letter,</HI> who mu&s;t be every way be&s;t able to &s;upport his own &s;entiments, will, I hope, excu&s;e me, if I &s;eem officiou&s;ly to interfere; when he con&s;iders, that the &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m, like
<PB N="4" REF="008601_0003_102F965C038C3FB8">
other qualities good and bad, is catching; and that his long &s;ilence &s;ince the <HI>Remarks</HI> appeared has made us de&s;pair of &s;eeing the &s;ubject farther di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by his ma&s;terly hand. The ingenious and candid remarker, too, who mu&s;t have been mi&s;led him&s;elf before he employed his &s;kill and addre&s;s to mi&s;lead others, will certainly, &s;ince he declares he <HI>aims at no &s;eduction,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Remarks, p. 6</NOTE> be di&s;po&s;ed to excu&s;e even the weake&s;t effort to prevent it.</P>
<P>And &s;urely if the general opinions that po&s;&s;e&s;s the minds of the people may po&s;&s;ibly be of con&s;equence in publick affairs, it mu&s;t be fit to &s;et tho&s;e opinions right. If there is danger, as the remarker &s;uppo&s;es, that "extravagant expectations" may embarra&s;s "a vir|tuous and able mini&s;try," and "render the nego|ciation for peace a work of infinite difficulty;" <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Remarks, p. 7.</NOTE> there is no le&s;s danger that expectations too low, thro' want of proper information, may have a con|trary effect, may make even a virtuous and able mini&s;try le&s;s anxious, and le&s;s attentive to the ob|taining points, in which the honour and intere&s;t of the nation are e&s;&s;entially concerned; and the peo|ple le&s;s hearty in &s;upporting &s;uch a mini&s;try and its mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The people of this nation are indeed re&s;pectable, not for their numbers only, but for their under|&s;tanding and their publick &s;pirit: they manife&s;t the fir&s;t, by their univer&s;al approbation of the late prudent and vigorous mea&s;ures, and the confidence they &s;o ju&s;tly repo&s;e in a wi&s;e and good prince, and an hone&s;t and able admini&s;tration; the latter they have demon&s;trated by the immen&s;e &s;upplies granted in parliament unanimou&s;ly, and paid through the whole kingdom with chearfulne&s;s. And &s;ince to this &s;pirit and the&s;e &s;upplies our "victories and &s;ucce&s;&s;es" <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Remarks, p. 7.</NOTE> have in great mea&s;ure
<PB N="5" REF="008601_0004_102F965F33C75348">
been owing, is it quite right, is it generous to &s;ay, with the <HI>remarker,</HI> that the people "had no &s;hare in acquiring them?" The mere mob he cannot mean, even where he &s;peaks of the <HI>madne&s;s of the people;</HI> for the madne&s;s of the mob mu&s;t be too feeble and impotent, arm'd as the government of this country at pre&s;ent is, to "over-rule," <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Remarks, p. 7.</NOTE> even in the &s;lighte&s;t in&s;tances, the "virtue and moderation" of a firm and &s;teady mini&s;try.</P>
<P>While the war continues, its final event is quite uncertain. The Victorious of this year may be the Vanqui&s;hed of the next. It may therefore be too early to &s;ay, what advantages we ought ab&s;olutely to in&s;i&s;t on, and make the <HI>&s;ine quibus non</HI> of a peace, If the nece&s;&s;ity of our affairs &s;hould oblige us to accept of terms le&s;s advantageous than our pre&s;ent &s;ucce&s;&s;es &s;eem to promi&s;e us, an intelligent people, as ours is, mu&s;t &s;ee that nece&s;&s;ity, and will ac|quie&s;ce. But as a peace, when it is made, may be made ha&s;tily; and as the unhappy continuance of the war affords us time to con&s;ider, among &s;everal advantages gain'd or to be gain'd, which of them may be mo&s;t for our intere&s;t to retain, if &s;ome and not all may po&s;&s;ibly be retained; I do not blame the public di&s;qui&s;ition of the&s;e points, as premature or u&s;ele&s;s. Light often ari&s;es from a colli&s;ion of opinions, as fire from flint and &s;teel; and if we can obtain the benefit of the <HI>light,</HI> without danger from the <HI>heat</HI> &s;ometimes produc'd by controver&s;y, why &s;hould we di&s;courage it?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing then, that heaven may &s;till continue to ble&s;s His Maje&s;ty's arms, and that the event of this ju&s;t war may put it in our power to retain &s;ome of our conque&s;ts at the making of a peace; let us con&s;ider whether we are to confine our&s;elves to tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions only that were "the <HI>objects</HI> for

which we began the war."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Remarks, p. 19.</NOTE> This the <HI>remarker</HI> &s;eems to think right, when the que&s;tion relates to
<Q><HI>Canada,</HI> properly &s;o called, it having never been mentioned as one of tho&s;e objects in any of our memorials or declarations, or in any national or publick act what&s;oever.</Q>
But the gentleman him|&s;elf will probably agree, that if the ce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Ca|nada</HI> would be a real advantage to us, we may de|mand it under his &s;econd head, as an "<HI>indemnifi|cation</HI> for the charges incurred" in recovering our ju&s;t rights; otherwi&s;e according to his own prin|ciples the demand of <HI>Guadaloupe</HI> can have no foun|dation.</P>
<P>That
<Q>our claims before the war were large enough for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and for &s;ecurity too,</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> tho' it &s;eems a clear point with the ingenious remarker, is, I own, not &s;o with me. I am rather of the con|trary opinion, and &s;hall pre&s;ently give my rea|&s;ons. But fir&s;t let me ob&s;erve, that we did not make tho&s;e claims becau&s;e they were large enough for &s;ecurity, but becau&s;e we could rightfully claim no more. Advantages gained in the cour&s;e of this war, may increa&s;e the extent of our rights. Our claims before the war contain'd &s;ome &s;ecurity; but that is no rea&s;on why we &s;hould neglect acquiring more when the demand of more is become rea|&s;onable. It may be rea&s;onable in the ca&s;e of <HI>A|merica</HI> to a&s;k for the &s;ecurity recommended by the author of the letter, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 30 of the <HI>Letter,</HI> and p. 21 of the <HI>Remarks.</HI></NOTE> tho' it would be prepo&s;terous to do it in many other ca&s;es: his propos'd demand is founded on the little value of <HI>Canada</HI> to the <HI>French;</HI> the right we have to a&s;k, and the power we may have to in&s;i&s;t on an indemnification for our expences; the difficulty the <HI>French</HI> them&s;elves

will be under of re&s;training their re&s;tle&s;s &s;ubjects in <HI>America</HI> from encroaching on our limits and di|&s;turbing our trade; and the difficulty on our parts of preventing encroachments that may po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t many years without coming to our know|ledge. But the remarker
<Q>does not &s;ee why the arguments employ'd concerning a &s;ecurity for a peaceable behaviour in <HI>Canada,</HI> would not be equally cogent for calling for the &s;ame &s;ecurity in <HI>Europe.</HI></Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Remarks, p. 24.</NOTE> On a little farther reflection, he mu&s;t I think be &s;en&s;ible, that the circum&s;tances of the two ca&s;es are widely different. Here we are &s;eparated by the be&s;t and cleare&s;t of boundaries, the ocean, and we have people in or near every part of our territory. Any attempt to encroach upon us, by building a fort, even in the ob&s;cure&s;t cor|ner of the&s;e i&s;lands, mu&s;t therefore be known and prevented immediately. The aggre&s;&s;ors al&s;o mu&s;t be known, and the nation they belong to would be accountable for their aggre&s;&s;ion. In <HI>America</HI> it is quite otherwi&s;e. A va&s;t wilderne&s;s thinly or &s;carce at all peopled, conceals with ea&s;e the march of troops and workmen. Important pa&s;&s;es may be &s;eized within our limits and forts built in a month, at a &s;mall expence, that may co&s;t us an age and a million to remove. Dear experience has taught us this. But what is &s;till wor&s;e, the wide extended fore&s;ts between our &s;ettlements and theirs, are in|habited by barbarous tribes of &s;avages that delight in war and take pride in murder, &s;ubjects properly neither of the <HI>French</HI> nor <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but &s;trongly attach'd to the former by the art and indefatigable indu&s;try of prie&s;ts, &s;imiliarity of &s;uper&s;titions, and frequent family alliances. The&s;e are ea&s;ily, and have been continually, in&s;tigated to fall upon and ma&s;&s;acre our planters, even in times of full peace

between the two crowns, to the certain diminution of our people and the contraction of our &s;ettle|ments.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A very intelligent writer of that country, Dr. <HI>Clark,</HI> in his <HI>Ob&s;ervations on the late and pre&s;ent conduct of the French,</HI> &amp;c. printed at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> 1755, &s;ays,</P>
<P><Q>The Indians in the <HI>French</HI> intere&s;t are, upon all proper op|portunities, in&s;tigated by their prie&s;ts, who have generally the chief management of their publick councils, to acts of ho|&s;tility again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> even in time of profound peace be|tween the two crowns. Of this there are many undeniable in&s;tances. The war between the Indians and the colonies of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> in 1723, by which tho&s;e colonies &s;uffered &s;o much damage, was begun by the in&s;tigation of the <HI>French;</HI> their &s;upplies were from them, and there are now original letters of &s;everal Je&s;uits to be pro|duced, whereby it evidently appears, that they were contin|ually animating the Indians, when almo&s;t tired with the war, to a farther pro&s;ecution of it. The <HI>French</HI> not only excited the Indians, and &s;upported them, but joined their own forces with them in all the late ho&s;tilities that have been committed within His Maje&s;ty's province of <HI>Nova-Scotia.</HI> And from an intercepted letter this year from the Je&s;uit at <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> and from other information, it is certain that they have been u&s;ing their utmo&s;t endeavours to excite the Indians to new acts of ho&s;tility, again&s;t His Maje&s;ty's colony of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay,</HI> and &s;ome have been committed.&mdash;The <HI>French</HI> not only excite the Indians to acts of ho&s;tility, but reward them for it, by buying the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pri&s;oners of them; for the ran&s;om of each of which they afterwards demand of us the price that is u&s;ually given for a &s;lave in the&s;e colonies. They do this un|der the &s;pecious pretence of re&s;cuing the poor pri&s;oners from the cruelties and barbarities of the &s;avages; but in reality to encourage them to continue their depredations, as they can by this means get more by hunting the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> than by hunt|ing wild bea&s;ts; and the <HI>French</HI> at the &s;ame time are thereby enabled to keep up a large body of Indians entirely at the ex|pence of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></Q></P></NOTE> And tho' it is known they are &s;upply'd by the <HI>French</HI> and carry their pri&s;oners to them, we can by complaining obtain no redre&s;s, as the governors of <HI>Canada</HI> have a ready excu&s;e, that the Indians are an independent people, over whom they have no power, and for whole actions they are
<PB N="9" REF="008601_0008_102F966BA7C76538">
therefore not accountable. Surely circum&s;tances &s;o widely different may rea&s;onably authori&s;e diffe|rent demands of &s;ecurity in <HI>America,</HI> from &s;uch as are u&s;ual or nece&s;&s;ary in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>remarker,</HI> however, thinks, that our real dependance for keeping
<Q><HI>France</HI> or any other na|tion true to her engagements, mu&s;t not be in demanding &s;ecurities which no nation whil&s;t <HI>inde|pendent</HI> can give, but on our own &s;trength and our own viligance.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Remarks, p. 25.</NOTE> No nation that has carried on a war with di&s;advantage, and is unable to con|tinue it, can be &s;aid, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, to be <HI>independent;</HI> and while either &s;ide thinks it&s;elf in a condition to demand an indemnification, there is no man in his &s;en&s;es, but will, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> prefer an indemnification that is a cheaper and more effectual &s;ecurity than any other he can think of. Nations in this &s;ituation demand and cede countries by almo&s;t every treaty of peace that is made. The <HI>French</HI> part of the i&s;land of St. <HI>Cri|&s;topher's</HI> was added to <HI>Great Britain</HI> in circum&s;tan|ces altogether &s;imilar to tho&s;e in which a few months may probably place the country of <HI>Canada.</HI> Farther &s;ecurity has always been deemed a motive with a conqueror to be le&s;s moderate; and even the vanqui&s;h'd in&s;i&s;t upon &s;ecurity as a rea&s;on for demanding what they acknowledge they could not otherwi&s;e properly a&s;k. The &s;ecurity of the frontier of <HI>France</HI> on the &s;ide of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> was always con&s;idered, in the negotiation that began at <HI>Getruy|denburgh,</HI> and ended with that war. For the &s;ame rea&s;on they demanded and had <HI>Cape Breton.</HI> But a war concluded to the advantage of <HI>France</HI> has al|ways added &s;omething to the power, either of <HI>France</HI> or the hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon.</HI> Even that of 1733, which &s;he commenced with declarations of
<PB N="10" REF="008601_0009_102F96724455F088">
her having no ambitious views, and which fini&s;hed by a treaty at which the mini&s;ters of <HI>France</HI> re|peatedly declared that &s;he de&s;ired nothing for her&s;elf, in effect gained for her <HI>Lorrain,</HI> an indem|nification ten times the value of all her <HI>North A|merican</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, &s;ecurity and quiet of princes and &s;tates have ever been deemed &s;ufficient rea&s;ons, when &s;upported by power, for di&s;po&s;ing of rights; and &s;uch di&s;po&s;ition has never been looked on as want of moderation. It has always been the foundation of the mo&s;t general treaties. The &s;e|curity of <HI>Germany</HI> was the argument for yielding con&s;iderable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions there to the <HI>Swedes:</HI> and the &s;ecurity of <HI>Europe</HI> divided the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> monar|chy, by the partition treaty, made between powers who had no <HI>other</HI> right to di&s;po&s;e of any part of it. There can be no ce&s;&s;ion that is not &s;uppo&s;ed at lea&s;t, to increa&s;e the power of the party to whom it is made. It is enough that he has a right to a&s;k it, and that he does it not merely to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of a dangerous ambition. <HI>Canada</HI> in the hands of <HI>Britain,</HI> will endanger the kingdom of <HI>France</HI> as little as any other ce&s;&s;ion; and from its &s;ituation and circum&s;tances cannot be hurtful to any other &s;tate. Rather, if peace be an advantage, this ce&s;&s;ion may be &s;uch to all <HI>Europe.</HI> The pre|&s;ent war teaches us, that di&s;putes ari&s;ing in <HI>A|merica,</HI> may be an occa&s;ion of embroiling na|tions who have no concerns there. If the <HI>French</HI> remain in <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Loui&s;iana,</HI> fix the bounda|ries as you will between us and them, we mu&s;t border on each other for more than 1500 miles. The people that inhabit the frontiers, are generally the refu&s;e of both nations, often of the wor&s;t morals and the lea&s;t di&s;cretion, remote from the eye, the prudence, and the re&s;traint of government. Injuries
<PB N="11" REF="008601_0010_102F9675620244B0">
are therefore frequently, in &s;ome part or other of &s;o long a frontier, committed on both &s;ides. Re|&s;entment provoked, the colonies fir&s;t engaged, and then the mother countries. And two great na|tions can &s;carce be at war in <HI>Europe,</HI> but &s;ome other prince or &s;tate thinks it a convenient oppor|tunity, to revive &s;ome ancient claim, &s;eize &s;ome advantage, obtain &s;ome territory, or enlarge &s;ome power at the expence of a neighbour. The flames of war once kindled, often &s;pread far and wide, and the mi&s;chief is infinite. Happy it prov'd to both nations, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> were prevailed on finally to cede the <HI>New Netherlands</HI> (now the pro|vince of <HI>New York</HI>) to us at the peace of 1674; a peace that has ever &s;ince continued between us, but mu&s;t have been frequently di&s;turbed, if they had retained the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that country, border|ing &s;everal hundred miles on our colonies of <HI>Pen|&s;ylvania</HI> we&s;tward, <HI>Connecticut</HI> and the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> ea&s;tward. Nor is it to be wondered at that peo|ple of different language, religion, and manners, &s;hould in tho&s;e remote parts engage in frequent quarrels, when we find, that even the people of our own colonies have frequently been &s;o exa&s;perated again&s;t each other in their di&s;putes about boun|daries, as to proceed to open violence and blood|&s;hed.</P>
<P>But the <HI>remarker</HI> thinks we &s;hall be &s;ufficiently &s;ecure in <HI>America,</HI> if we
<Q>rai&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> forts at &s;uch pa&s;&s;es as may at once make us re&s;pectable to the <HI>French</HI> and to the <HI>Indian</HI> nations.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Remarks, p. 25.</NOTE> The &s;ecurity de&s;irable in <HI>America,</HI> may be con&s;idered as of three kinds; 1. A &s;ecurity of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that the <HI>French</HI> &s;hall not drive us out of the country. 2. A &s;ecurity of our planters from the inroads of &s;avages, and the murders committed by them.
<PB N="12" REF="008601_0011_102F9676F3BF73A8">
3. A &s;ecurity that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> nation &s;hall not be oblig'd on every new war to repeat the immen&s;e expence occa&s;ion'd by this, to defend its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in <HI>America.</HI> Forts in the mo&s;t important pa&s;&s;es, may, I acknowledge be of u&s;e to obtain the fir&s;t kind of &s;ecurity: but as tho&s;e &s;ituations are far ad|vanc'd beyond the inhabitants, the expence of maintaining and &s;upplying the garri&s;ons, will be very great, even in time of full peace, and immen&s;e on every interruption of it; as it is ea&s;y for &s;kulk|ing parties of the enemy in &s;uch long roads thro' the woods, to intercept and cut off our convoys, un|le&s;s guarded continually by great bodies of men. The &s;econd kind of &s;ecurity, will not be obtain|ed by &s;uch forts, unle&s;s they are connected by a wall like that of <HI>China,</HI> from one end of our &s;ettle|ments to the other. If the <HI>Indians</HI> when at war, march'd like the <HI>Europeans,</HI> with great armies, heavy cannon, baggage, and carriages, the pa&s;&s;es thro' which alone &s;uch armies could penetrate our country, or receive their &s;upplies, being &s;ecur'd, all might be &s;ufficiently &s;ecure; but the ca&s;e is widely different. They go to war, as they call it, in &s;mall parties, from fifty men down to five. Their hunting life has made them acquainted with the whole country, and &s;carce any part of it is im|practicable to &s;uch a party. They can travel thro' the woods even by night, and know how to con|ceal their tracks. They pa&s;s ea&s;ily between your forts undi&s;cover'd; and privately approach the &s;ettlements of your frontier inhabitants. They need no convoys of provi&s;ions to follow them; for whether they are &s;hifting from place to place in the woods, or lying in wait for an opportunity to &s;trike a blow, every thicket and every &s;tream fur|ni&s;hes &s;o &s;mall a number with &s;ufficient &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.

But let the number of the <HI>Indians</HI> be what it will, they are not formidable merely on account of their numbers; there are many other circum&s;tances that give them a great advantage over the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> inhabitants, though numerous, are extended over a large tract of land, 500 leagues in length on the &s;ea-&s;hore; and altho' &s;ome of their trading towns are thick &s;ettled, their &s;ettlements in the country towns mu&s;t be at a di&s;tance from each other: be|&s;ides, that in a new country, where lands are cheap, people are fond of acquiring large tracts to them&s;elves; and there|fore in the out &s;ettlements, they mu&s;t be more remote: and as the people that move out are generally poor, they &s;it down, either where they can ea&s;ie&s;t procure land, or &s;oone&s;t rai&s;e a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.

The <HI>Indian</HI> way of making war is by &s;udden attacks upon expo&s;ed places; and as &s;oon as they have done mi&s;chief, they retire, and either go home by the &s;ame or &s;ome different rout, as they think &s;afe&s;t; or go to &s;ome other place at a di&s;tance, to renew their &s;troke. If a &s;uf|ficient party &s;hould happily be ready to pur&s;ue them, it is a great chance, whether in a country, con&s;i&s;ting of woods and &s;wamps, which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are not acquainted with, the ene|my do not lie in ambu&s;h for them in &s;ome convenient place, and from thence de&s;troy them.

<P><Q>It has been already remarked, that the tribes of the <HI>In|dians</HI> living upon the lakes and rivers that run upon the back of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ettlements in <HI>North-America,</HI> are very numerous, and can furni&s;h a great number of fighting men, all per|fectly well acquainted with the u&s;e of arms as &s;oon as capable of carrying them, as they get the whole of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from hunting; and that this army, large as it may be, can be maintained by the French without any expence. From their numbers, their &s;ituation, and the rivers that run into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ettlements, it is ea&s;y to conceive that they can at any time make an attack upon, and con&s;tantly annoy as many of the expo&s;ed <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ettlements as they plea&s;e, and tho&s;e at any di&s;tance from each other. The effects of &s;uch incur&s;ions have been too &s;everely felt by many of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> colonies, not to be very well known. The entire breaking up places that had been for a con&s;iderable time &s;ettled at a great ex|pence, both of labour and money; burning the hou&s;es, de|&s;troying the &s;tock, killing and making pri&s;oners great num|bers of the inhabitants, with all the cruel u&s;age they meet with in their captivity, is only a part of the &s;cene. All other places that are expo&s;ed are kept in continual terror; the lands lie wa&s;te and uncultivated from the danger that attends tho&s;e that &s;hall pre&s;ume to work upon them: be&s;ides the immen&s;e charge the governments mu&s;t be at in a very inef|fectual manner to defend their extended frontiers; and all this from the influence the <HI>French</HI> have had over, but com|paratively, a few of the <HI>Indians.</HI> To the &s;ame or greater evils &s;till will every one of the colonies be expo&s;ed, when|ever the &s;ame influence &s;hall be extended to the whole body of them.</Q>

I do not &s;ay they are altogether unconcerned in the event.

Yet &s;o unfor|tunate have they been, that their virtue has made again&s;t them; for upon no better foundation than this, have they been &s;uppo&s;ed the authors of a war carried on <HI>for their advantage only.</HI> It is a great mi&s;take to imagine that the <HI>American</HI> coun|try in que&s;tion between <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> is claimed as the property of any individuals or pub|lick body in <HI>America,</HI> or that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it by <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> is likely, in any lucrative view, to redound at all to the advantage of any per&s;on there.

On the other hand, the bulk of the inhabitants of <HI>North America</HI> are land-owners, who&s;e lands are inferior in value to tho&s;e of <HI>Britain,</HI> only by the want of an equal number of people. It is true the acce&s;&s;ion of the large territory claimed before the war began, e&s;pecially if that be &s;ecured by the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Canada,</HI> will tend to the increa&s;e of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ubjects, fa&s;ter than if they had been con|fin'd within the mountains: yet the increa&s;e within the mountains only, would evidently make the comparative population equal to that of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> much &s;ooner than it can be expected when our people are &s;pread over a country &s;ix times as large. I think this is the only point of light in which this que&s;tion is to be viewed, and is the only one in which any of the colonies are con|cerned. No colony, no po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of lands in any colony, therefore wi&s;hes for conque&s;ts, or can be benefited by them, otherwi&s;e than as they may be a means of &s;ecuring peace on their borders. No con&s;iderable advantage has re&s;ulted to the colonies by the conque&s;ts of this war, or can re&s;ult from confirming them by the peace, but what they mu&s;t enjoy in common with the re&s;t of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> peo|ple; with this evident drawback from their &s;hare of the&s;e advantages, that they will nece&s;&s;arily le&s;|&s;en, or at lea&s;t prevent the increa&s;e of the value of what makes the principal part of their private pro|perty. A people &s;pread thro' the whole tract of country on this &s;ide the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi,</HI> and &s;ecured by <HI>Canada</HI> in our hands, would probably for &s;ome centuries find employment in agriculture, and thereby free us at home effectually from our fears of <HI>American</HI> manufactures. Unprejudic'd men well know that all the penal and prohibitory laws that ever were thought on, will not be &s;ufficient to pre|vent manufactures in a country who&s;e inhabitants

Manufactures are founded in poverty. It is the multitude of poor without land in a country, and who mu&s;t work for others at low wages or &s;tarve, that enables under|takers to carry on a manufacture, and afford it cheap enough to prevent the importation of the &s;ame kind from abroad, and to bear the expence of its own exportation. But no man who can have a piece of land of his own, &s;ufficient by his labour to &s;ub&s;i&s;t his family in plenty, is poor e|nough to be a manufacturer, and work for a ma|&s;ter. Hence while there is land enough in <HI>America</HI> for our people, there can never be manufactures to any amount or value. It is a &s;triking ob&s;ervation of a very <HI>able pen,</HI> that the natural livelihood of the thin inhabitants of a fore&s;t country, is hunting; that of a greater number, pa&s;turage; that of a middling population, agriculture; and that of the greate&s;t, manufactures; which la&s;t mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t the bulk of the people in a full country, or they mu&s;t be &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by charity, or peri&s;h.

<P>Our <HI>North American</HI> colonies are to be con&s;i|dered as the frontier of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire on that &s;ide.

<P>A reader of the remarks may be apt to &s;ay; if this writer would have us re&s;tore <HI>Canada</HI> on prin|ciples of moderation, how can we con&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e principles, retain <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> which he repre|&s;ents of &s;o much greater value!

as how? Why, plainly, (at length it comes out) if the <HI>French</HI> are not left there to check the growth of our colo|nies,
<Q>they will extend them&s;elves almo&s;t without bounds into the inland parts, and increa&s;e in|finitely from all cau&s;es;&mdash;becoming a numerous, hardy, <HI>independent</HI> people, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;trong country, communicating little or not at all with <HI>England,</HI> living wholly on their own labour, and in proce&s;s of time knowing little and enquiring little about the mother country.</Q>
In &s;hort, ac|cording to this writer, our pre&s;ent colonies are large enough and numerous enough, and the <HI>French</HI> ought to be left in <HI>North America</HI> to prevent their increa&s;e, le&s;t they become not only <HI>u&s;ele&s;s</HI> but <HI>dangerous</HI> to <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="008601_0024_102F969C895F3350">I agree with the gentleman, that with <HI>Canada</HI> in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, our people in <HI>America</HI> will increa&s;e amaz|ingly. I know that their common rate of increa&s;e, where they are not mole&s;ted by the enemy, is doubl|ing their numbers every twenty-five years by natural generation only, exclu&s;ive of the acce&s;&s;ion of fo|reigners. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rea&s;on of this greater increa&s;e in <HI>America</HI> than in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> is, that in old &s;ettled countries, all trades, farms, offices, and employments are full, and many people refrain marrying till they &s;ee an opening, in which they can &s;ettle them&s;elves, with a rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of maintaining a family: but in <HI>A|merica,</HI> it being ea&s;y to obtain land which with moderate la|bour will afford &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and &s;omething to &s;pare, people marry more readily and earlier in life, whence ari&s;es a nume|rous offspring and the &s;wift population of tho&s;e countries, 'Tis a common error that we cannot fill our provinces or increa&s;e the number of them, without draining this nation of its people.

The <HI>remarker</HI> is re&s;erv'd in giving his rea&s;ons, as in his opinion this "is not a fit &s;ubject for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion."

<P>The remarker thinks that our people in <HI>Ame|rica,</HI>

The very rea&s;on he a&s;&s;igns for their &s;o extending, and which is indeed the true one, their being
<Q>invited to it by the plea&s;antne&s;s, fertility and plenty of the country,</Q>
may &s;atisfy us, that this exten&s;ion will continue to proceed as long as there remains any plea&s;ant fertile country within their reach. And if we even &s;uppo&s;e them con|fin'd by the waters of the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi</HI> we&s;tward, and by tho&s;e of <HI>St. Laurence</HI> and the lakes to the northward, yet &s;till we &s;hall leave them room e|nough to increa&s;e, even in the <HI>&s;par&s;e</HI> manner of &s;ettling now practis'd there, till they amount to perhaps a hundred millions of &s;ouls. This mu&s;t take &s;ome centuries to fulfil, and in the mean time, this nation mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;upply them with the manufactures they con&s;ume, becau&s;e the new &s;ettlers will be employed in agriculture, and the new &s;ettle|ments will &s;o continually draw off the &s;pare hands from the old, that our pre&s;ent colonies will not, during the period we have mention'd, find them|&s;elves in a condition to manufacture even for their own inhabitants, to any con&s;iderable degree, much le&s;s for tho&s;e who are &s;ettling behind them. Thus our <HI>trade</HI> mu&s;t, till that country becomes as fully peopled as <HI>England,</HI> that is, for centuries to come, be continually increa&s;ing, and with it our naval power; becau&s;e the ocean is between us and them, and our &s;hips and &s;eamen mu&s;t increa&s;e as that trade increa&s;es.</P>
<P>The human body and the political differ in this, that the fir&s;t is limited by nature to a certain

&s;tature, which, when attain'd, it cannot, ordinarily, exceed; the other by better government and more prudent police, as well as by change of manners and other circum&s;tances, often takes fre&s;h &s;tarts of growth, after being long at a &s;tand; and may add tenfold to the dimen&s;ions it had for ages been con|fined to. The mother being of full &s;tature, is in a few years equalled by a growing daughter: but in the ca&s;e of a mother country and her colonies, it is quite different.

<P>Were the inhabitants of this i&s;land limited to their pre&s;ent number by any thing in nature, or by un|changeable circum&s;tances, the equality of popu|lation between the two countries might indeed &s;ooner come to pa&s;s: but &s;ure experience in tho&s;e parts of the i&s;land where manufactures have been introduced, teaches us, that people increa&s;e and multiply in proportion as the means and facility of gaining a livelihood increa&s;e; and that this i&s;land, if they could be employed, is capable of &s;upport|ing ten times its pre&s;ent number of people. In proportion, therefore, as the demand increa&s;es for the manufactures of <HI>Britain,</HI> by the increa&s;e of people in her colonies, the numbers of her people at home will increa&s;e, and with them the &s;trength as well as the wealth of the nation. For &s;atisfaction in this point let the reader compare in his mind the number and force of our pre&s;ent fleets, with our fleet in queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Viz.</HI> Forty &s;ail, none of more than 40 guns.</NOTE> before we had colonies.

<P>But, &s;ay the objectors, "there is a certain di&s;tance from the &s;ea, in <HI>America,</HI> beyond which the ex|pence of carriage will put a &s;top to the &s;ale and con&s;umption of your manufactures; and this, with the difficulty of making returns for them, will oblige the inhabitants to manufacture for them|&s;elves; of cour&s;e, if you &s;uffer your people to ex|tend their &s;ettlements beyond that di&s;tance, your people become u&s;ele&s;s to you:" and this di&s;tance is limited by &s;ome to 200 miles, by others to the <HI>Apalachian</HI> mountains. Not to in&s;i&s;t on a very plain truth, that no part of a dominion, from whence a government may on occa&s;ion draw &s;up|plies and aids both of men of money, tho' at too great a di&s;tance to be &s;upply'd with manufactures from &s;ome other part, is therefore to be deem'd u&s;ele&s;s to the whole; I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how that the&s;e imaginary limits of utility, even in point of commerce, are much too narrow.</P>

<P>If the growths of a country find their way out of it, the manufactures of the countries where they go, will infallibly find their way into it. They who under&s;tand the oeconomy and principles of manu|factures, know, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;tabli&s;h them in places not populous; and even in tho&s;e that are populous, hardly po&s;&s;ible to e&s;tabli&s;h them to the prejudice of the places already in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of them. Several attempts have been made in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> countenanced by the Government, to draw from us and e&s;tabli&s;h in tho&s;e countries, our hard-ware and woolen manufactures, but without &s;ucce&s;s. The rea&s;ons are various. A manufacture is part of a great &s;y&s;tem of commerce, which takes in conveniences of various kinds, methods of pro|viding materials of all &s;orts, machines for expect|ing and facilitating labour, all the channels of cor|re&s;pondence for vending the wares, the credit and confidence nece&s;&s;ary to found and &s;upport this corre&s;pondence, the mutual aid of different arti|zans, and a thou&s;and other particulars, which time and long experience have gradually e&s;tabli&s;hed. A part of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem cannot &s;upport it&s;elf without the whole, and before the whole can be obtained
<PB N="33" REF="008601_0032_102F96BC4EDAB818">
the part peri&s;hes. Manufactures where they are in perfection, are carried on by a multiplicity of hands, each of which is expert only in his own part, no one of them a ma&s;ter of the whole; and it by any means &s;pirited away to a foreign country, he is lo&s;t without his fellows. Then it is a matter of the ex|treme&s;t difficulty to per&s;uade a complete &s;et of workmen, &s;killed in all parts of a manufactory, to leave their country together and &s;ettle in a foreign land. Some of the idle and drunken may be enticed away, but the&s;e only di&s;appoint their employers, and &s;erve to di&s;courage the under|taking. If by royal munificence, and an expence that the profits of the trade alone would not bear, a complete &s;et of good and &s;kilful hands are col|lected and carried over, they find &s;o much of the &s;y&s;tem imperfect, &s;o many things wanting to carry on the trade to advantage, &s;o many difficulties to overcome, and the knot of hands &s;o ea&s;ily broken, by death, di&s;&s;atisfaction and de&s;ertion, that they and their employers are di&s;couraged together, and the project vani&s;hes into &s;moke. Hence it happens, that e&s;tabli&s;hed manufactures are hardly ever lo&s;t, but by foreign conque&s;t, or by &s;ome eminent inte|rior fault in manners or government; a bad police oppre&s;&s;ing and di&s;couraging the workmen, or reli|gious per&s;ecutions driving the &s;ober and indu&s;trious out of the country. There is in &s;hort, &s;carce a &s;ingle in&s;tance in hi&s;tory of the contrary, where manufactures have once taken firm root. They &s;ometimes &s;tart up in a new place, but are general|ly &s;upported like exotic plants at more expence than they are worth for any thing but curio&s;ity, until the&s;e new &s;eats become the refuge of the ma|nufacturers driven from the old ones. The con|que&s;t of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and final reduction of the <HI>Greek</HI> empire, di&s;per&s;ed many curious manufactu|rers

The lo&s;s of liberty in <HI>Verona, Milan, Florence, Pi&s;a, Pi&s;toia,</HI> and other great cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> drove the manufacturers of woolen cloth into <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Flanders.</HI> The latter fir&s;t lo&s;t their trade and ma|nufacturers to <HI>Antwerp</HI> and the cities of <HI>Brabant,</HI> from whence by per&s;ecution for religion they were &s;ent into <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>England.</HI> The civil wars during the minority of <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> which ended in the lo&s;s of the liberty of their great towns, ended too in the lo&s;s of the manufactures of <HI>Toledo, Segovia, Salamanca, Medina del Campo, &amp;c.</HI> The revocation of the edict of <HI>Nantes,</HI> communi|cated, to all the Prote&s;tant parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> the paper, &s;ilk, and other valuable manufactures of <HI>France,</HI> almo&s;t peculiar at that time to that country, and till then in vain attempted el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>To be convinced that it is not &s;oil and climate, or even freedom from taxes, that determines the re&s;idence of manufacturers, we need only turn our eyes on <HI>Holland,</HI> where a multitude of manufac|tures are &s;till carried on (perhaps more than on the &s;ame extent of territory any where in <HI>Europe</HI>) and &s;old on terms upon which they cannot be had in any other part of the world. And this too is true of tho&s;e growths, which by their nature and the labour required to rai&s;e them, come the neare&s;t to manufactures.</P>
<P>As to the common-place objection to the <HI>North American</HI> &s;ettlements, that they are in the &s;ame climate and their produce the &s;ame as that of <HI>Eng|land;</HI> in the fir&s;t place it is not true; it is particular|ly not &s;o of the countries now likely to be added to our &s;ettlements; and of our pre&s;ent colonies, the products, lumber, tobacco, rice, and indigo, great articles of commerce, do not interfere with the pro|ducts

<P>If I have been &s;ucce&s;sful in proving that a con|&s;iderable commerce may and will &s;ub&s;i&s;t between us and our future mo&s;t inland &s;ettlements in <HI>North America,</HI> notwith&s;tanding their di&s;tance, I have more than half proved no other inconveniency will ari&s;e from their di&s;tance. Many men in &s;uch a country, mu&s;t <HI>"know,"</HI> mu&s;t <HI>"think"</HI> and mu&s;t <HI>"care"</HI> about the country they chiefly trade with. The juridical and other connections of government are yet a fa&s;ter hold than even commercial ties, and &s;pread directly and indirectly far and wide. Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to be &s;olicited and cau&s;es depending, create a great intercour&s;e even where private property is not divided into different countries, yet this divi&s;ion will always &s;ub&s;i&s;t where different countries are ruled by the &s;ame government. Where a man has landed property both in the mother country and a pro|vince, he will almo&s;t always live in the mother country: this, though there were no trade, is &s;ingly a &s;ufficient gain. It is &s;aid, that <HI>Ireland</HI> pays near a million <HI>Sterling</HI> annually to its ab&s;en|tees in <HI>England:</HI> The ballance of trade from <HI>Spain</HI> or even <HI>Portugal</HI> is &s;carcely equal to this.</P>
<P>Let it not be &s;aid we have no ab&s;entees from <HI>North America.</HI> There are many to the writer's knowledge; and if there are at pre&s;ent but few of them that di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves here by great ex|pence, it is owing to the mediocrity of fortune a|mong the inhabitants of the <HI>Northern colonies;</HI> and

a more equal divi&s;ion of landed property, than in the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> i&s;lands, &s;o that there are as yet but few large e&s;tates.

<P>However this may be, if in our views of im|mediate advantage, it &s;eems preferable that the gentlemen of large fortunes in <HI>North America</HI> &s;hould re&s;ide much in <HI>England,</HI> 'tis what may &s;urely be expected as fa&s;t as &s;uch fortunes are acquired there. Their having

will not prevent it: A little knowledge and learning acquired, in|crea&s;es the appetite for more, and will make the conver&s;ation of the learned on this &s;ide the water more &s;trongly de&s;ired. <HI>Ireland</HI> has its univer&s;ity likewi&s;e; yet this does not prevent the immen&s;e pecuniary benefit we receive from that kingdom. And there will always be in the conveniencies of life, the politene&s;s, the plea&s;ures, the magnificence of the reigning country, many other attractions be|&s;ides tho&s;e of learning, to draw men of &s;ub&s;tance there, where they can, apparently at lea&s;t, have the be&s;t bargain of happine&s;s for their money.</P>
<P>Our trade to the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> i&s;lands is undoubt|edly a valuable one: but whatever is the amount of it, it has long been at a &s;tand.

for the plain frugal manner of living of its inhabitants, and the mo&s;t &s;u&s;pected of carrying on manufactures on account of the number of <HI>Ger|man</HI> artizans, who are known to have tran&s;planted them&s;elves into that country, though even the&s;e, in truth, when they come there, generally apply them&s;elves to agriculture as the &s;ure&s;t &s;upport and mo&s;t advantageous employment. By this account it appears, that the exports to that province have in 28 years, increa&s;ed nearly in the proportion of 17 to 1; whereas the people them&s;elves, who by other authentic accounts appear to double their numbers (the &s;trangers who &s;ettle there included) in about 16 years, cannot in the 28 years have in|crea&s;ed in a greater proportion than as 4 to 1: the additional demand then, and con&s;umption of goods from <HI>England,</HI> of 13 parts in 17 more than the additional number would require, mu&s;t be owing to this, that the people having by their in|du&s;try mended their circum&s;tances, are enabled to indulge them&s;elves in finer cloaths, better furni|ture, and a more general u&s;e of all our manufac|tures than heretofore. In fact, the occa&s;ion for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> goods in <HI>North America,</HI> and the inclination to have and u&s;e them, is, and mu&s;t be for ages to come, much greater than the ability of the people to pay for them; they mu&s;t therefore, as they now do, deny them&s;elves many things they would other|wi&s;e chu&s;e to have, or increa&s;e their indu&s;try to obtain them; and thus, if they &s;hould at any time manufacture &s;ome coar&s;e article, which on account
<PB N="40" REF="008601_0039_102F96CE451E7C60">
of its bulk or &s;ome other circum&s;tance, cannot &s;o well be brought to them from <HI>Britain,</HI> it only enables them the better to pay for finer goods that otherwi&s;e they could not indulge them&s;elves in: &s;o that the exports thither are not dimini&s;hed by &s;uch manufacture but rather increa&s;ed. The &s;ingle article of manufacture in the&s;e colonies men|tioned by the <HI>remarker,</HI> is <HI>hats</HI> made in <HI>New Eng|land.</HI> It is true there have been ever &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of that country, a few hatters there, drawn thither probably at fir&s;t by the facility of getting beaver, while the woods were but little clear'd, and there was plenty of tho&s;e animals. The ca&s;e is greatly altered now. The beaver &s;kins are not now to be had in <HI>New England,</HI> but from very remote places and at great prices. The trade is accordingly declin|ing there, &s;o that, far from being able to make hats in any quantity for exportation, they cannot &s;upply their home demand; and it is well known that &s;ome thou&s;and dozens are &s;ent thither yearly from <HI>London,</HI> and &s;old there cheaper than the in|habitants can make them of equal gohdne&s;s. In fact, the colonies are &s;o little &s;uited for e&s;tabli&s;hing of manufactures, that they are continually lo&s;ing the few branches they accidentally gain. The working bra&s;iers, cutlers, and pewterers, as well as hatters, who have happened to go over from time to time and &s;ettle in the colonies, gradually drop the working part of their bu&s;ine&s;s, and im|port their re&s;pective goods from <HI>England,</HI> whence they can have them cheaper and better than they can make them. They continue their &s;hops in|deed, in the &s;ame way of dealing, but become <HI>&s;el|lers</HI> of bra&s;iery, cutlery, pewter, hats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> brought from <HI>England,</HI> in&s;tead of being <HI>makers</HI> of tho&s;e goods.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="008601_0040_102F96CFD3849CD0">Thus much as to the apprehen&s;ion of our colo|nies becoming <HI>u&s;ele&s;s</HI> to us. I &s;hall next con&s;ider the other &s;uppo&s;ition, that their growth may ren|der them <HI>dangerous.</HI> Of this I own, I have not the lea&s;t conception, when I con&s;ider that we have already fourteen &s;eparate governments on the ma|ritime coa&s;t of the continent, and if we extend our &s;ettlements &s;hall probably have as many more be|hind them on the inland &s;ide. Tho&s;e we now have, are not only under different governors, but have dif|ferent forms of government, different laws, different intere&s;ts, and &s;ome of them different religious per|&s;ua&s;ions and different manners. Their jealou&s;y of each other is &s;o great that however nece&s;&s;ary an union of the colonies has long been, for their com|mon defence and &s;ecurity again&s;t their enemies, and how &s;en&s;ible &s;oever each colony has been of that nece&s;&s;ity, yet they have never been able to effect &s;uch an union among them&s;elves, nor even to a|gree in reque&s;ting the mother country to e&s;tabli&s;h it for them. Nothing but the immediate command of the crown has been able to produce even the imperfect union but lately &s;een there, of the forces of &s;ome colonies. If they could not agree to unite for their defence again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> who were perpetually hara&s;&s;ing their &s;ettlements, burning their villages, and murdering their people; can it rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed there is any danger of their uniting again&s;t their own nation, which protects and encourages them, with which they have &s;o many connections and ties of blood, in|tere&s;t and affection, and which 'tis well known they all love much more than they love one another? In &s;hort, there are &s;o many cau&s;es that mu&s;t operate to prevent it, that I will venture to &s;ay, an union among&s;t them for &s;uch a purpo&s;e is not merely im|probable, it is impo&s;&s;ible; and if the union of
<PB N="42" REF="008601_0041_102F96D315743000">
the whole is impo&s;&s;ible, the attempt of a part mu&s;t be madne&s;s: as tho&s;e colonies that did not join the rebellion, would join the mother country in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it.</P>
<P>When I &s;ay &s;uch an union is impo&s;&s;ible, I mean without the mo&s;t grievous tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion. People who have property in a country which they may lo&s;e, and privileges which they may endan|ger; are generally di&s;pos'd to be quiet; and even to bear much, rather than hazard all. While the government is mild and ju&s;t, while important civil and religious rights are &s;ecure, &s;uch &s;ubjects will be dutiful and obedient. The waves do not ri&s;e, but when the winds blow. What &s;uch an admini|&s;tration as the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI>'s in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> might produce, I know not; but this I think I have a right to deem impo&s;&s;ible. And yet there were two very manife&s;t differences between that ca&s;e, and ours, and both are in our favour. The fir&s;t, that <HI>Spain</HI> had already united the &s;eventeen provinces under one vi&s;ible government, tho' the &s;tates continued independent: The &s;econd, that the inhabitants of tho&s;e provinces were of a nation, not only different from, but utterly unlike the <HI>Spa|niards.</HI> Had the <HI>Netherlands</HI> been peopled from <HI>Spain,</HI> the wor&s;t of oppre&s;&s;ion had probably not provoked them to wi&s;h a &s;eparation of govern|ment. It might and probably would have ruined the country, but would never have produced an independent &s;overeignty. In fact, neither the very wor&s;t of governments, the wor&s;t of politicks in the la&s;t century, nor the total abolition of their re|maining liberty, in the provinces of <HI>Spain</HI> it&s;elf, in the pre&s;ent, have produced any independency that could be &s;upported. The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of <HI>France.</HI> And let it not be &s;aid that the neigh|bourhood of the&s;e to the &s;eat of government has
<PB N="43" REF="008601_0042_102F96D91443AAF8">
prevented a &s;eparation. While our &s;trength at &s;ea continues, the banks of the <HI>Ohio</HI> (in point of ea&s;y and expeditious conveyance of troops) are nearer to <HI>London,</HI> than the remote parts of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> to their re&s;pective capitals; and much nearer than <HI>Connaught</HI> and <HI>Ul&s;ter</HI> were in the days of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> No body foretels the di&s;&s;o|lution of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> monarchy from its extent, yet I will venture to &s;ay, the ea&s;tern parts of it are al|ready much more inacce&s;&s;iable from <HI>Peter&s;burgh,</HI> than the country on the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi</HI> is from <HI>London;</HI> I mean more men, in le&s;s time, might be con|veyed the latter than the former di&s;tance. The rivers <HI>Oby, Jene&s;ea</HI> and <HI>Lena,</HI> do not facilitate the communication half &s;o well by their cour&s;e, nor are they half &s;o practicable as the <HI>American</HI> rivers. To this I &s;hall only add the ob&s;ervation of <HI>Machiavel,</HI> in his <HI>Prince,</HI> that a government &s;eldom long pre|&s;erves its dominion over tho&s;e who are foreigners to it; who on the other hand fall with great ea&s;e, and continue in&s;eparably annex'd to the govern|ment of their own nation, which he proves by the fate of the <HI>Engli&s;h conque&s;ts</HI> in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Yet with all the&s;e di&s;advantages, &s;o difficult is it to overturn an e&s;tabli&s;hed government, that it was not without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Eng|land,</HI> that the <HI>United Provinces</HI> &s;upported them|&s;elves: which teaches us, that if the vi&s;ionary dan|ger of independence in our colonies is to be feared, nothing is more likely to render it &s;ub&s;tantial than the neighbourhood of foreigners at enmity with the &s;overeign government, capable of giving either aid or an a&s;ylum, as the event &s;hall require. Yet again&s;t even the&s;e di&s;advantages, did <HI>Spain</HI> pre|&s;erve almo&s;t ten provinces, merely through their want of union, which indeed could never have taken place among the others, but for cau&s;es, &s;ome

I know how little many good-natured per&s;ons are affected by the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of people at a di&s;tance and whom they do not know.

If it be, after all, thought nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>check</HI> the growth of our colonies, give me leave to propo&s;e a method le&s;s cruel. It is a method of which we have an example in &s;cripture.

<P>But all this debate about the propriety or im|propriety of keeping or re&s;toring <HI>Canada,</HI> is po&s;&s;i|bly too early. We have taken the capital indeed, but the country is yet far from being in our po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; and perhaps never will be: for if our M&mdash;rs are per&s;uaded by &s;uch coun&s;ellors as the <HI>remarker,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> there are "not the wor&s;t of neighbours," and that if we had con|quered <HI>Canada,</HI> we ought for our own &s;akes to re|&s;tore it, as a <HI>check</HI> to the growth of our colonies, I am then afraid we &s;hall never take it.

<P>The objection I have often heard, that if we had <HI>Canada,</HI> we could not people it without draining <HI>Britain</HI> of its inhabitants, is founded on ignorance of the nature of population in new countries.

The annual in|crement alone of our pre&s;ent colonies, without di|mini&s;hing their numbers, or requiring a man from hence, is &s;ufficient in ten years to fill <HI>Canada</HI> with double the number of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that it now has of <HI>French</HI> inhabitants. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In fact, there has not gone from <HI>Britain</HI> to our colonies the&s;e 20 years pa&s;t, to &s;ettle there, &s;o many as 10 families a year; the new &s;ettlers are either the offspring of the old, or emigrants from <HI>Germany</HI> or the north of <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> Tho&s;e who are prote&s;tants among the <HI>French,</HI> will probably chu&s;e to remain under the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> government; many will chu&s;e to remove, if they can be allowed to &s;ell their lands, improvements and effects: the re&s;t in that thin-&s;ettled

<P>I have before &s;aid I do not deny the utility of the conque&s;t, or even of our future po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Guadaloupe,</HI> if not bought to dear.

It would be a very long and a very di&s;agreeable one, to run thro' every thing material on this head. It is enough to our pre&s;ent point, if I have &s;hown, that the value of <HI>North America</HI> is capable of an immen&s;e increa&s;e, by an acqui&s;ition and mea&s;ures, that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have an effect the direct contrary of what we have been indu&s;triou&s;ly taught to fear; and that <HI>Guada|loupe</HI> is, in point of advantage, but a very &s;mall ad|dition to our <HI>We&s;t India</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, rendered many ways le&s;s valuable to us than it is to the <HI>French,</HI> who will probably &s;et more value upon it than upon a country that is much more valuable to us than to them.</P>

<P N="2">2. For people increa&s;e in proportion to the number of marri|ages, and that is greater in proportion to the ea&s;e and conveni|ence of &s;upporting a family. When families can be ea&s;ily &s;up|ported, more per&s;ons marry, and earlier in life.</P>
<P N="3">3. In cities, where all trades, occupations and offices are full, many delay marrying, till they can &s;ee how to bear the charges of a family; which charges are greater in cities, as luxury is more common; many live &s;ingle during life, and continue &s;ervants to families, journeymen to trades, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> hence cities do not by na|tural generation &s;upply them&s;elves with inhabitants; the deaths are more than the births.</P>
<P N="4">4. In countries full &s;ettled, the ca&s;e mu&s;t be nearly the &s;ame; all lands being occupied and improved to the heighth; tho&s;e who cannot get land, mu&s;t labour for others that have it; when labourers are plenty, their wages will be low; by low wages a family is &s;upported with difficulty; this difficulty deters many from marriage, who therefore long continue &s;ervants and &s;ingle.&mdash; Only as the cities take &s;upplies of people from the country, and thereby make a little more room in the country, marriage is a little more encouraged there, and the births exceed the deaths.</P>
<P N="5">5. Great part of <HI>Europe</HI> is full &s;ettled with hu&s;bandmen, manufacturers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and therefore cannot now much increa&s;e in people: <HI>America</HI> is chiefly occupied by <HI>Indians,</HI> who &s;ub&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly by hunting.&mdash;But as the hunter, of all men, requires the greate&s;t quantity of land from whence to draw his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, (the hu&s;bandmen &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on much le&s;s, the Gardener on &s;till

le&s;s, and the manufacturer requiring lea&s;t of all) the <HI>Europeans</HI> found <HI>America</HI> as fully &s;ettled as it well could be by hunters; yet the&s;e having large tracts, were ea&s;ily prevailed on to part with portions of territory to the new comers, who did not much inter|fere with the natives in hunting, and furni&s;hed them with many things they wanted.</P>
<P N="6">6. Land being thus plenty in <HI>America,</HI> and &s;o cheap as that a labouring man, that under&s;tands hu&s;bandry, can in a &s;hort time &s;ave money enough to purcha&s;e a piece of new land &s;ufficient for a plantation, whereon he may &s;ub&s;i&s;t a family; &s;uch are not afraid to marry; for if they even look far enough forward to con&s;ider how their children when grown up are to be provid|ed for, they &s;ee that more land is to be had at rates euually ea&s;y, all cirmcum&s;tances con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="7">7. Hence marriages in <HI>America</HI> are more general, and more generally early, than in <HI>Europe.</HI> And if it is reckoned there, that there is but one marriage <HI>per annum</HI> among 100 per&s;ons, perhaps we may here reckon two; and if in <HI>Europe</HI> they have but four births to a marriage (many of their marriages being late) we may here reckon eight; of which if one half grow up, and our marriages are made, reckoning one with another, at twenty years of age, our people mu&s;t at lea&s;t be doubled every twenty years.</P>
<P N="8">8. But notwith&s;tanding this increa&s;e, &s;o va&s;t is the territory of <HI>North America,</HI> that it will require many ages to &s;ettle it ful|ly; and till it is fully &s;ettled, labour will never be cheap here, where no man continues long a labourer for others, but gets a plantation of his own; no man continues long a journeyman to a trade, but goes among tho&s;e new &s;ettlers, and &s;ets up for him&s;elf, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hence labour is no cheaper now, in <HI>Pen&s;ilvania,</HI> than it was thirty years ago, tho' &s;o many thou&s;and labouring people have been imported from <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. The danger therefore of the&s;e colonies interfering with their mother country in trades that depend on labour, manufac|tures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is too remote to require the attention of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. But in proportion to the increa&s;e of the colonies, a va&s;t demand is growing for <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> manufactures; a glorious market wholly in the power of <HI>Britain,</HI> in which foreigners cannot inter|fere, which will increa&s;e in a &s;hort time even beyond her power of &s;upplying, tho' her whole trade &s;hould be to her colonies.* * * * * * * * *</P>

<P N="13">13. As the increa&s;e of people depends on the encouragement of marriages, the following things mu&s;t dimini&s;h a nation, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. The being conquered; for the conquerors will engro&s;s as many offices, and exact as much tribute or profit on the labour of the conquered, as will maintain them in their new e&s;tabli&s;hment; and this dimini&s;hing the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the natives, di&s;courages their marriages, and &s;o gradually dimini&s;hes them, while the foreigners increa&s;e. 2. Lo&s;s of territory. Thus the <HI>Britons</HI> be|ing driven into <HI>Wales,</HI> and crouded together in a barren coun|try in&s;ufficient to &s;upport &s;uch great numbers, dimini&s;hed till the people bore a proportion to the produce, while the <HI>Saxons</HI> in|crea&s;ed on their abandoned lands, till the i&s;land became full of <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> And were the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> now driven into <HI>Wales</HI> by &s;ome foreign nation, there would in a few years be no more <HI>Engli&s;h|men</HI> in <HI>Britain,</HI> than there are now people in <HI>Wales.</HI> 3. Lo&s;s of trade. Manufactures exported, draw &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from foreign countries for numbers; who are thereby enabled to marry and rai&s;e families. If the nation be deprived of any branch of trade, and no new employment is found for the people occupy'd in that branch, it will &s;oon be deprived of &s;o many people. 4. Lo&s;s of food. Suppo&s;e a nation has a fi&s;hery, which not only employs great numbers, but makes the food and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the people cheaper: if another nation becomes matter of the &s;eas, and prevents the fi&s;hery, the people will dimini&s;h in proportion as the lo&s;s of employ, and dearne&s;s of provi&s;ion makes it more difficult to &s;ub&s;i&s;t a family. 5. Bad government and in&s;ecure pro|perty. People not only leave &s;uch a country, and &s;ettling abroad incorporate with other nations, lo&s;e their native language, and become foreigners; but the indu&s;try of tho&s;e that remain being di&s;couraged, the quantity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in the country is le&s;&s;en|ed, and the &s;upport of a family becomes more difficult. So heavy taxes tend to dimini&s;h a people. 6. The introduction of &s;laves. The negroes brought into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ugar i&s;lands,
<PB N="55" REF="008601_0054_102F9701D9ACEFE0">
have greatly dimini&s;hed the whites there; the poor are by this means deprived of employment, while a few families acquire va&s;t e&s;tates, which they &s;pend on foreign luxuries, and educating their children in the habit of tho&s;e luxuries; the &s;ame income is needed for the &s;upport of one, that might have maintained one hundred. The whites, who have &s;laves, not labouring, are enfeebled, and therefore not &s;o generally prolific; the &s;laves being worked too hard, and ill fed, their con&s;titutions are bro|ken, and the deaths among them are more than their births; &s;o that a continual &s;upply is needed from <HI>Africa.</HI> The northern colonies having few &s;laves, encrea&s;e in whites. Slaves al&s;o pe|jorate the families that u&s;e them; the white children become proud, di&s;gu&s;ted with labour, and being educated in idlene&s;s, are rendered unfit to get a living by indu&s;try.</P>
<P N="14">14. Hence the prince that acquires new territory, if he finds it vacant, or removes the natives to give his own people room; the legi&s;lator that makes effectual laws for promoting of trade, increa&s;ing employment, improving land by more or better tillage, providing more food by fi&s;heries, &s;ecuring property, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the man that invents new trades, arts or manufactures, or new improvements in hu&s;bandry, may be properly called <HI>Fathers of their Nation,</HI> as they are the cau&s;e of the generation of multitudes, by the encouragement they afford to marriage.</P>

As to privileges granted to the married, (&s;uch as the <HI>jus trium liberorum</HI> among the <HI>Romans</HI>) they may ha&s;ten the filling of a country that has been thinned by war or pe&s;tilence, or that has otherwi&s;e vacant territory, but cannot increa&s;e a people be|yond the means provided for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>

Foreign luxuries and needle&s;s manufactures imported and u&s;ed in a nation, do, by the &s;ame rea&s;oning, increa&s;e the people of the nation that furni&s;hes them, and dimini&s;h the people of the nation that u&s;es them.&mdash;Laws therefore that prevent &s;uch im|portations, and on the contrary promote the exportation of manufactures to be con&s;umed in foreign countries, may be called (with re&s;pect to the people that make them) <HI>generative laws,</HI> as by increa&s;ing &s;ub&s;i&s;tence they encourage marriage. Such laws likewi&s;e &s;trengthen a country doubly, by increa&s;ing its own people and dimini&s;hing its neighbours.</P>
<P N="17">17. Some <HI>European</HI> nations prudently refu&s;e to con&s;ume the manufactures of <HI>Ea&s;t-India:</HI>&mdash;They &s;hould likewi&s;e forbid them to their colonies; for the gain to the merchant is not to be compared with the lo&s;s by this means of people to the nation.</P>
<P N="18">18. Home luxury in the great increa&s;es the nation's ma|nufacturers employed by it, who are many, and only tends to dimini&s;h the families that indulge in it, who are few. The greater the common fa&s;hionable expence of any rank of people, the more cautious they are of marriage. Therefore luxury &s;hould never be &s;uffered to become common.</P>
<P N="19"><PB N="56" REF="008601_0055_102F970380A6CF20">19. The great increa&s;e of offspring in particular families, is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature, but &s;ometimes to examples of indu&s;try in the heads, and indu&s;trious education; by which the children are enabled to provide better for them|&s;elves, and their marrying early is encouraged from the pro&s;pect of good &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P N="20">20. If there be a &s;ect therefore, in our nation, that regard frugality and indu&s;try as religious duties, and educate their children therein, more than others commonly do; &s;uch &s;ect mu&s;t con&s;equently increa&s;e more by natural generation, than any other &s;ect in <HI>Britain.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P N="21">21. The importation of foreigners into a country that has as many inhabitants as the pre&s;ent employments and provi&s;ions for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence will bear, will be in the end no increa&s;e of people, unle&s;s the new comers have more indu&s;try and frugality than the natives, and then they will provide more &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and in|crea&s;e in the country; but they will gradually eat the natives out.&mdash;Nor is it nece&s;&s;ary to bring in foreigners to fill up any occa&s;ional vacancy in a country; for &s;uch vacancy (if the laws are good, &sect; 14, 16) will &s;oon be filled by natural generation. Who can now find the vacancy made in <HI>Sweden, France,</HI> or other warlike nations, by the plague of heroi&s;m 40 years ago; in <HI>France,</HI> by the expul&s;ion of prote&s;tants; in <HI>England,</HI> by the &s;ettlement of her colonies; or in <HI>Guinea,</HI> by 100 years exporta|tion of &s;laves that has blackened half <HI>America?</HI>&mdash;The thinne&s;s of the inhabitants in <HI>Spain,</HI> is owing to national pride and idle|ne&s;s, and other cau&s;es, rather than to the expul&s;ion of the <HI>Moors,</HI> or to the making of new &s;ettlements.</P>
<P N="22">22. There is in &s;hort no bound to the prolific nature of plants or animals, but what is made by their crowding and interfering with each other's means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Was the face of the earth vacant of other plants, it might be gradually &s;owed and over&s;pread with one kind only; as for in&s;tance, with Fennel; and were it empty of other inhabitants, it might in a few ages be repleni&s;hed from one nation only; as for in&s;tance with <HI>Eng|li&s;hmen.</HI> Thus there are &s;uppo&s;ed to be now upwards of one Mil|lion <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ouls in <HI>North America,</HI> (tho' 'tis thought &s;carce 80,000 have been brought over &s;ea) and yet perhaps there is not one the fewer in <HI>Britain,</HI> but rather many more, on account of the employment the colonies afford to manufacturers at home. This million doubling, &s;uppo&s;e but once in 25 years, will in another century be more than the people of <HI>England,</HI> and the greate&s;t number of <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> will be on this &s;ide the water.</P>
<P>What an acce&s;&s;ion of power to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire by &s;ea as well as land! What increa&s;e of trade and navigation! What numbers of &s;hips and &s;eamen! We have been here but little

more than 100 years, and yet the force of our privateers in the late war, united, was greater, both in men and guns, than that of the whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> navy in queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time.&mdash; How important an affair then to <HI>Britain,</HI> is the pre&s;ent treaty <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1751.</NOTE> for &s;ettling the bounds between her colonies and the <HI>French,</HI> and how careful &s;hould &s;he be to &s;ecure room enough, &s;ince on the room depends &s;o much the Increa&s;e of her people?</P>
<P N="23">23. In fine, a nation well regulated is like a polypus; <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A water-in&s;ect, well-known to naturali&s;ts.</NOTE> take away a limb, its place is &s;oon &s;upply'd; cut it in two, and each deficient part &s;hall &s;peedily grow out of the part remaining. Thus if you have room and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence enough, as you may by dividing, make ten polypu&s;es out of one, you may of one make ten nations, equally populous and powerful; or rather increa&s;e a nation tenfold in numbers and &s;trength. * * * * * * * * * *</P>

<P>By the&s;e accounts it appears, that the Exports to the <HI>We&s;t India I&s;lands</HI> and to the <HI>Northern Colonies</HI> were in the fir&s;t term nearly equal; the difference being only 122,936<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 4<ABBR><HI>d</HI></ABBR> and in the &s;econd term, the exports to tho&s;e i&s;lands had only increa&s;ed 404,504<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 2<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 1<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR>&mdash;Whereas the increa&s;e to the <HI>Northern Colonies</HI> is 3,927,789<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 3<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 1<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> almo&s;t Four Millions.</P>
<P>Some part of this increa&s;ed demand for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> goods, may be a&s;cribed to the armies and fleets we have had both in <HI>North America,</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t In|dies;</HI> not &s;o much for what is con&s;umed by the &s;oldiery; their cloathing, &s;tores, ammunition, &amp;c. &s;ent from hence on account of the government, being (as is &s;uppo&s;ed) not included in the&s;e ac|counts of merchandize exported; but, as the war has occa&s;ioned a great plenty of money in <HI>America,</HI> many of the inhabitants have increa&s;ed their ex|pence.</P>

<P>AN <HI>Hi&s;torical Review</HI> of the Con&s;titution and Government of Pensylvania, from its <HI>Origin;</HI> &s;o far as regards the &s;everal Points of Con|trover&s;y which have, from Time to Time, ari&s;en between the &s;everal <HI>Governors</HI> of that Province, and their &s;everal <HI>A&s;&s;emblies.</HI> Founded on <HI>authentic Documents.</HI> Dedi|cated to the Right Honourable ARTHUR ONSLOW, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Speaker of the Honour|able Hou&s;e of COMMONS.</P>
<Q>Tho&s;e who would give up ESSENTIAL LIBERTY to purcha&s;e a little TEMPORARY SAFETY, de|&s;erve neither Liberty nor Safety.</Q>
<P><HI>In the</HI> Dedication <HI>are the&s;e Words:</HI></P>
<P><Q>The Cau&s;e we bring is in Fact the Cau&s;e of all the Provinces in one: It is the Cau&s;e of every Briti&s;h Sub|ject in every Part of the Briti&s;h Domin|ions. It is the Cau&s;e of every Man who de&s;erves to be free every where.</Q></P>
<Q>To the above Quotation from the Dedication, the follow|ing Paragraphs are added, as a Specimen of the Author's Ability to handle and apply tho&s;e authentic Documents in an accurate and ju&s;t Manner.</Q>
<P>"TO obtain an infinite Variety of Purpo&s;es, by a few plain Principles, is the Characteri&s;tic of Nature. As the Eye is affected, &s;o is the Under&s;tand|ing: Objects at di&s;tance &s;trike us according to their Dimen&s;ions, or the Quantity of Light thrown upon them; near, according to their Novelty or Familiar|ity; as they are in motion or at re&s;t.

with Actions. A Battle is all Motion; a Hero all Glare: While &s;uch Images are before us, we can at|tend to nothing el&s;e. <HI>Solon</HI> and <HI>Lycurgus</HI> would make no Figure in the &s;ame Scene with the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia;</HI> and we are at pre&s;ent &s;o lo&s;t in the military Scramble on the Continent <HI>next</HI> us, in which it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed we are deeply intere&s;ted, that we have &s;carce Time to throw a Glance towards <HI>America,</HI> where we have al&s;o much at Stake, and where, if any where, our Account mu&s;t be made up at la&s;t. <HI>Introduct.</HI></P>
<P>"We love to &s;tare more than to reflect, and to be indolently amus'd at our Lei&s;ure, than to commit the &s;malle&s;t Tre&s;pa&s;s on our Patience by winding a pain|ful tedious Maze, which would pay us in nothing but Knowledge. <HI>Introduction.</HI></P>
<P>"Surely, to a Nation born to Liberty like This, bound to leave it unimpair'd as they received it from their Fathers in Perpetuity to their Heirs, and inter|e&s;ted in the Con&s;ervation of it in every Appendix of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire, the Particulars of &s;uch a Conte&s;t cannot be wholly indifferent. <HI>Intro.</HI></P>
<P>"On the contrary, it is rea&s;onable to think,the fir&s;t Workings of Power again&s;t Liberty, and the natural Efforts of unbia&s;&s;ed Men to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t the fir&s;t Approaches of Oppre&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t have a cap|tivating Power over every Man of Sen&s;ibility and Di&s;cernment among&s;t us. <HI>Introd.</HI></P>
<P>"It is a known Cu&s;tom among Farmers to change their Corn from Sea&s;on to Sea&s;on for the Sake of filling the Bu&s;hel: And in Ca&s;e the Wi&s;dom of the Age &s;hould conde&s;cend to make the like Experiment in another Shape, from hence we may learn, whither to repair for the proper Species. <HI>Intro.</HI></P>
<P>"Courage, Wi&s;dom, Integrity and Honour are not to be mea&s;ured by the Sphere a&s;&s;igned them to act in, but by the Trials they undergo, and the Vouchers they furni&s;h: And if &s;o manife&s;ted, need neither Robes or Titles to &s;et them off. <HI>Intro.</HI></P>
<P>From the Body of the Book.</P>
<P>"There is &s;omething in Connection and Depend|ance which gives a &s;ecret Bia&s;s to all we think and with, as well as what we &s;ay: And in all Di&s;putes this mu&s;t be duly allowed for on both Sides.</P>
<P>"Men who want a pre&s;ent Convenience mu&s;t not be over-&s;olicitous about future Contingencies; and, in general, we chu&s;e to be blind to &s;uch Ob&s;tacles as we fear we have not Strength enough to remove.</P>
<P>"Though Protection is the Rea&s;on, and, con|&s;equently
<PB REF="008601_0061_102F9718253FA500">
&s;hould be the End of Government, we ought to be as much upon our Guard again&s;t our Protectors as again&s;t our Enemies,</P>
<P>"Power, like Water, is ever working its own Way; and wherever it can find or make an Opening, is altogether as prone to overflow whatever is &s;ubject to it.</P>
<P>"And tho' Matter of Right overlooked, may be reclaimed and re-a&s;&s;umed at any Time, it cannot be too &s;oon reclaimed and re-a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>"To unite the Subtilty of the Serpent with the Innocence of the Dove, is not &s;o ea&s;ily done as &s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>Speaking of a Party-Di&s;pute, the Author &s;ays&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>"Thus Heat kindled Heat: Animo&s;ity excited Animo&s;ity: And each Party re&s;olving to be always in the Right, were often both in the Wrong.</P>
<P><HI>Speaking in Ju&s;tification of the Conduct of the &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies, in a certain Di&s;pute, he &s;ays,</HI> "Men they were: Pa&s;&s;ions and Intere&s;ts they con&s;equently had: And if they were &s;ometimes carried away a little too far by them, it is obvious the Pa&s;&s;ions and Intere&s;ts of others worked up the Ferment fir&s;t, and never re|lented to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>"It is true, an over-rigid Performance of Condi|tions is not to be expected of Government, and &s;el|dom can be exacted from it. But then if the Repre|&s;entative Part is not tenacious, almo&s;t to a Fault, of the Rights and Claims of a People, they will in a Cour&s;e of Time lo&s;e their very Preten&s;ions to them.</P>
<P><HI>He al&s;o affirms,</HI> that "Of all political Cements, Reciprocal Intere&s;t is the &s;tronge&s;t: And the Subjects Money is never &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed of as in the Mainten|ance of Order and Tranquility, and the Purcha&s;e of good Laws.</P>
<P><HI>Towards the Conclu&s;ion are the following Paragraphs.</HI></P>
<P>"The TRUE STATE of <HI>Pen&s;ylvania</HI> is now before us.&mdash;It is apparent the A&s;&s;emblies of that Province have acted from the Beginning on the <HI>defen&s;ive only:</HI> The Defen&s;ive is what every Man, by the Right and Law of Nature, is intitled to.&mdash; Jealou&s;y is the fir&s;t Principle of Defence: If Men were not to &s;u&s;pect, they would rarely, if ever, be upon their Guard. &mdash; <HI>Magna Charta</HI> is apparently founded upon this Prin|ciple; nay, provides, That Oppo&s;ition &s;hould be always at Hand to confront and obviate Danger.&mdash; <HI>Penn,</HI> the Founder of the Colony, founded it upon <HI>Magna Charta:</HI> And, as we have &s;een, the Birth-Rights of his Followers were rather enlarged than
<PB REF="008601_0062_102F9719B1F09778">
dimini&s;hed by his In&s;titutions.&mdash; That the latter Part of his active Life, therefore, was employed in under|mining his own Foundations, only &s;erves to excite our Concern, That &s;o few &s;hould be of a Piece with them&s;elves; and to make him an&s;werable in Part for the Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es of his Heirs.</P>
<P>"Fatally verified, however, we &s;ee, both there and every where el&s;e, the Fable of the <HI>Ax,</HI> which having been gratified with as much Wood only as would &s;erve it for a Handle, became immediately the In&s;trument to hew down the Fore&s;t, Root and Branch, from whence it was taken.</P>
<P>"It is as apparent, on the other Hand, That the&s;e <HI>Proprietaries</HI> have acted an <HI>offen&s;ive Part;</HI> have &s;et up unwarrantable Claims; have adhered to them by In&s;tructions yet more unwarrantable; have availed them&s;elves of the Dangers and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Pro|vince, and made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s (at lea&s;t their Depu|ties have) to increa&s;e the Terrors of the Times, pur|po&s;ely to unhinge the pre&s;ent Sy&s;tem; and, by the Dint of A&s;&s;umptions, Snares, Menaces, A&s;per&s;ions, Tumults, and every other unfair Practice what&s;oever, would have either bullied or wheadled the Inhabitants out of the Privileges they were born to: Nay, they have actually avowed this perfidious Purpo&s;e, by a|vowing and di&s;per&s;ing tho&s;e Pamphlets in which the &s;aid Privileges are in&s;olently, wickedly, and fooli&s;hly pronounced repugnant to Government, the Sources of Confu&s;ion; and &s;uch as, having an&s;wered the great End of cau&s;ing an expeditious Settlement, for which alone they were granted, might be re&s;umed at Plea|&s;ure, as incompatible with the <HI>Dictatorial</HI> Power they now challenge and would fain exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>"And This being the Truth, the plain Truth, and Nothing but the Truth, there is no need to di|rect the Cen&s;ures of the Public; which, on proper Information, are always &s;ure to fall in the right Place.</P>
<P>"The Parties before them are the <HI>Two Proprieta|ries</HI> of a <HI>Province,</HI> and the <HI>Province</HI> it&s;elf.&mdash;And Who or What are the&s;e <HI>Proprietaries?</HI> In the Pro|vince un&s;izeable Subjects and un&s;ufficient Lords.&mdash; At Home, Gentlemen, 'tis true, but Gentlemen &s;o very private, that in the Herd of Gentry they are hardly to be found:&mdash;Not in Court; not in Office; not in Parliament.</P>
<P>"And which is of mo&s;t Con&s;equence to the <HI>Com|munity;</HI> Whether <HI>their private E&s;tate</HI> &s;hall be <HI>taxed,</HI> or the <HI>Province</HI> &s;hall be <HI>&s;aved?</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="008601_0063_102F971B4391AE58">"Whether the&s;e Two private Gentlemen, in Vir|tue of their <HI>ab&s;olute Proprietary&s;hip,</HI> &s;hall convert &s;o many <HI>Fellow-Subjects,</HI> born as free as them&s;elves, into <HI>Va&s;&s;als?</HI> Or, Whether &s;o noble and u&s;eful a <HI>Province</HI> &s;hall for ever remain an <HI>A&s;ylum</HI> for all that wi&s;h to remain as free as the Inhabitants of it have, hitherto, made a Shift to pre&s;erve them&s;elves?</P>
<P>Sub Judice Lis e&s;t.</P>
<P>"What Part the Offices here at Home have taken in this Controver&s;y, it will be Time enough to &s;pecify when 'tis over: And Appeals, re&s;pectively made, argue a Pre&s;umption, That Right will be done.</P>
