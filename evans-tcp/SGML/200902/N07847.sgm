<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>HALIFAX, Nova-Scotia,</HI> <DATE><HI>January</HI> 20, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you very kindly for the pam|phlets and news-papers, you was &s;o obliging as to &s;end me. I will, according to your re|que&s;t, give you a few mi&s;cellaneous &s;trictures on that pamplet wrote by Mr. <HI>H&mdash;p&mdash;s,</HI> your governor, entitled, "The rights of colonies exa|amined."</P>
<P>His honour reminds me of the <HI>Roman</HI> poet.
<Q><L>"E&s;t genus hominum, qui e&s;&s;e primos &s;e omnium rerum volunt,</L>
<L>"Nec &s;unt.&mdash;"</L></Q>
He &s;eems to give a &s;olemnity to his performance, as if the &s;ubject had not been &s;ufficiently handled by
<PB N="4" REF="010011_0003_0F7B98B9F0DC4148">
any other before him, but I am of opinion he falls very &s;hort of Mr.&mdash;, who, though unhappily mi&s;led by popular ideas, and at the head of the <HI>tribunitian veto,</HI> yet appears to be a man of knowledge and parts: Whereas <HI>the rights of colonies examined,</HI> is a laboured, o&s;tentatious piece, di&s;covers its author to be totally unacquainted with &s;tile or diction, and eagerly fond to pa&s;s upon the world for a man of letters.</P>
<P>I cannot forgive the honourable author in adopt|ing for his motto the three lines from <HI>Thomp&s;on,</HI> &s;o little applicable are they to the pre&s;ent times. I might challenge all the &s;ons of di&s;content and faction, in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dominions, to &s;hew the lea&s;t &s;imilitude between the years one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and forty-one, and one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty-four. How cruel and invidious is it to in&s;inuate the mo&s;t di&s;tant likene&s;s between the two periods? How much like &s;edition does it &s;eem, to a&s;&s;ociate the pre|&s;ent tran&s;actions of the nation with tho&s;e of one thou|&s;and &s;ix hundred and forty-one, which &s;oon after kindled into a civil war, and in the end overturned the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con&s;titution?</P>
<P>The honourable author might perhaps flatter him|&s;elf, that, in future editions of <HI>Thomp&s;on</HI>'s liberty, commentators may in&s;ert <HI>variae lectiones</HI> of the text, and the three lines run thus:
<Q><L>"Mid the low murmurs of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive fear,</L>
<L>"And mingled rage, my <HI>H&mdash;p&mdash;s</HI> rais'd his voice,</L>
<L>"And to the laws appeal'd."</L></Q>
Or perhaps &s;ome future bard may &s;ing the pre&s;ent times, and HE be made the hero of the &s;ong. The aptne&s;s is ea&s;y and &s;triking, and the idea too plea&s;ing
<PB N="5" REF="010011_0004_0F7B98BABAF6E110">
to be re&s;i&s;ted. <HI>Narci&s;&s;us,</HI> in contemplating his own image, was turned into a daffodil. Who can think of this, and feel no pity for the pride and weakne&s;s of <HI>man that is born of a woman.</HI></P>
<Q><L>"So have I &s;een, on &s;ome bright &s;ummer's day,</L>
<L>"A calf of genius, debonnair and gay,</L>
<L>"Dance on the brink, as if in&s;pired by fame,</L>
<L>"Fond of the pretty fellow in the &s;tream."</L>
<BIBL>LOVE OF FAME, THE UNIVERSAL PASSION.</BIBL></Q>
<P>I would fain hope that his honour's motto is not a true portrait of the general temper and conduct of the <HI>Americans;</HI> I would rather think <Q><HI>the low mur|murs of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive fear, and mingled rage,</HI></Q> delineate only a few di&s;appointed traders. It were to be wi&s;hed that &s;ome friend of the colonies would endeavour to remove any unfavourable impre&s;&s;ions this, and other pamphlets of the like kind, may have occa&s;ioned at home; le&s;t tho&s;e in power form the general cha|racter of the colonies from &s;uch notices as the&s;e con|vey, and from thence be inclined to increa&s;e their dependance, rather than to emancipate them from the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ed impo&s;itions. Depend upon it, my Friend, a people like the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> arrived to the highe&s;t pitch of glory and power, the envy and admi|miration of &s;urrounding &s;laves, who hold the balance of <HI>Europe</HI> in their hands, and rival in arts and arms every period of ancient or modern &s;tory; a nation who, for the defence and &s;afety of <HI>America</HI> only, &s;taked their all in the late war; this people, I &s;ay, ju&s;tly con&s;cious of their dignity, will not patiently be dictated to by tho&s;e whom they have ever con&s;i|dered as dependant upon them. Happy will it be for the colonies, yea happy for the honourable author,
<PB N="6" REF="010011_0005_0F7B98BB97AE83E8">
if his pamphlet &s;hould meet with nothing more than contempt and neglect; for &s;hould it catch the at|tention of men in power, mea&s;ures may be taken to &s;tifle in the birth <HI>"the low murmurs of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive fear,"</HI> and cru&s;h in embryo <HI>"the mingled rage,"</HI> which now &s;o prettily adorns the head of his honour's pamphlet.</P>
<P>However di&s;gui&s;ed, poli&s;hed or &s;oftened the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of this pamphlet may &s;eem, yet every one mu&s;t &s;ee, that its profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign is &s;ufficiently pro|minent throughout, namely, to prove, <HI>that the colo|nies have rights independant of, and not controulable by, the authority of parliament.</HI> It is upon this dan|gerous and indi&s;creet po&s;ition I &s;hall communicate to you my real &s;entiments.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e a de&s;ign of en&s;laving the colonies by parliament, is too pre&s;umptuous; to propagate it in print, is perhaps dangerous. Perplexed between a de&s;ire of &s;peaking all he thinks, and the fear of &s;aying too much, the honourable author is obliged to en|trench him&s;elf in ob&s;curity and incon&s;i&s;tency in &s;eve|ral parts of his performance: I &s;hall bring one in|&s;tance.</P>
<P>In page eleven, he &s;ays, <Q>It is the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of every good and loyal &s;ubject chearfully to obey, and patiently &s;ubmit to, all the laws, orders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that may be pa&s;&s;ed by parliament.</Q></P>
<P>I do not much admire either the &s;pirit or compo|&s;ition of this &s;entence. Is it the duty <HI>only</HI> of good and loyal &s;ubjects to obey? Are the wicked and di&s;|loyal &s;ubjects ab&s;olved from this obligation? el&s;e why is this pa&s;&s;age &s;o marvellou&s;ly penned: <HI>Philo|levtherus Lip&s;ien&s;is</HI> would directly pronounce this a figure in rhetorick, called non&s;en&s;e.&mdash;Believe me, my friend, I did not quote this pa&s;&s;age to &s;hew my &s;kill
<PB N="7" REF="010011_0006_0F7B98BCD4780168">
in critici&s;m, but to point out a contradiction between it, and another pa&s;&s;age in page twenty, which runs thus: <Q>It mu&s;t be ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that the com|mon people of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> have a &s;overeign and ab&s;olute authority over their fellow &s;ubjects of <HI>America, or even any &s;ort of power what&s;oever over them;</HI> but it will be &s;till more ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, they can give a power to their repre&s;entatives, which they have not them&s;elves,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here it is ob&s;ervable, that the fir&s;t cited pa&s;&s;age expre&s;&s;es a full &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the authority of parliament; the la&s;t is as explicit a denial of that authority. The &s;um of his honour's argument is this: The people of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> have not any &s;ort of power over the <HI>Ameri|cans;</HI> the hou&s;e of commons have no greater autho|rity than the people of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> who are their con&s;tituents; <HI>ergo,</HI> the hou&s;e of commons <HI>have not any &s;ort of power over the</HI> Americans. This is indeed a curious invented &s;yllogi&s;m, the &s;ole merit of which is due to the fir&s;t magi&s;trate of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colony.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to inve&s;tigate the true natural relation, if I may &s;o &s;peak, between colonies and their mother &s;tate, ab&s;tracted from compact or po&s;i|tive in&s;titution, but here I can find nothing &s;atisfacto|ry; till this relation is clearly defined upon a rational and natural principle, our rea&s;oning upon the mea|&s;ure of the colonies obedience will be de&s;ultory and inconclu&s;ive. Every connection in life has its reci|procal duties; we know the relation between a pa|rent and child, hu&s;band and wife, ma&s;ter and &s;ervant, and from thence are able to deduce their re&s;pective obligations; but we have no notices of any &s;uch pre|ci&s;e natural relation between a mother &s;tate and its colonies, and therefore cannot rea&s;on with &s;o much
<PB N="8" REF="010011_0007_0F7B98BD613995B0">
certainty upon the power of the one, or the duty of the others. The ancients have tran&s;mitted to us nothing that is applicable to the &s;tate of modern colonies, becau&s;e the relation between the&s;e is formed by political compact; and the condition of each variant in their original, and from each other. The honour|able author has not freed this &s;ubject from any of its embarra&s;&s;ments: Vague and diffu&s;e talk of rights and privileges, and ringing the changes upon the words liberty and &s;lavery, only &s;erve to convince us, that words may affect without rai&s;ing images, or affording any repo&s;e to a mind philo&s;ophically inqui|&s;itive. For my own part, I will &s;hun the walk of metaphy&s;icks in my enquiry, and be content to con|&s;ider the colonies rights upon the footing of their charters, which are the only plain avenues, that lead to the truth of this matter.</P>
<P>The &s;everal <HI>New-England</HI> charters a&s;certain, define and limit the re&s;pective rights and privileges of each colony, and I cannot conceive how it has come to pa&s;s that the colonies now claim any other or greater rights than are therein expre&s;ly granted to them. I fancy when we &s;peak, or think of the rights of free|born <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> we confound tho&s;e rights which are per&s;onal, with tho&s;e which are political: There is a di&s;tinction between the&s;e, which ought always to be kept in view.</P>
<P>Our per&s;onal rights, comprehending tho&s;e of life, liberty and e&s;tate, are &s;ecured to us by the common law, which is every &s;ubject's birthright, whether born in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> on the ocean, or in the colonies; and it is in this &s;en&s;e we are &s;aid to enjoy all the rights and privileges of <HI>Engli&s;hmen.</HI> The political rights of the colonies, or the powers of government commu|nicated
<PB N="9" REF="010011_0008_0F7B98BDAE6D7B98">
to them, are more limited, and their nature, quality and extent depend altogether upon the patent or charter which fir&s;t created and in&s;tituted them. As individuals, the coloni&s;ts participate of every ble&s;|&s;ing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con&s;titution can give them: As cor|porations created by the crown, they are confined within the primitive views of their in&s;titution. Whe|ther therefore their indulgence is &s;canty or liberal, can be no cau&s;e of complaint; for when they ac|cepted of their charters, they tacitly &s;ubmitted to the terms and conditions of them.</P>
<P>The colonies have no rights independant of their charters, they can claim no greater than tho&s;e give them, by tho&s;e the parliamentary juri&s;diction over them is not taken away, neither could any grant of the king abridge that juri&s;diction, becau&s;e it is found|ed upon common law, as I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew, and was prior to any charter or grant to the colonies: Every <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> therefore, is &s;ubject to this juri&s;|diction, and it follows him wherever he goes. It is of the e&s;&s;ence of government, that there &s;hould be a &s;upreme head, and it would be a &s;oleci&s;m in politicks to talk of members independant of it.</P>
<P>With regard to the juri&s;diction of parliament, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, that it is attached to every <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ubject, wherever he be: And I am led to do this from a clau&s;e in page nine of his honour's pamphlet, where he &s;ays, <Q>That the colonies do not hold their rights, as a privilege granted them, nor enjoy them as a grace and favour be&s;towed; but po&s;&s;e&s;s them, as an inherent, indefea&s;ible right.</Q> This po&s;tulatum cannot be true with regard to poli|tical rights, for I have already &s;hewn, that the&s;e are derived from your charters, and are held by force of
<PB N="10" REF="010011_0009_0F7B98C1587E9D58">
the king's grant; therefore the&s;e inherent, indefea&s;ible rights, as his honour calls them, mu&s;t be per&s;onal ones, according to the di&s;tinction already made. Per|mit me to &s;ay, that inherent and indefea&s;ible as the&s;e rights may be, the juri&s;diction of parliament, over every <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ubject, is equally as inherent and inde|fea&s;ible: That both have grown out of the &s;ame &s;tock, and that if we avail our&s;elves of the one, we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to, and acknowlege the other.</P>
<P>It might here be properly enough a&s;ked, Are the&s;e per&s;onal rights &s;elf-exi&s;tent? Have they no original &s;ource? I an&s;wer, They are derived from the con|&s;titution of <HI>England,</HI> which is the common law; and from the &s;ame fountain is al&s;o derived the juri&s;diction of parliament over us.</P>
<P>But to bring this argument down to the mo&s;t vul|gar apprehen&s;ion: The common law has e&s;tabli&s;hed it as a rule or maxim, that the plantations are bound by <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> acts of parliament, if particularly named: And &s;urely no <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> in his &s;en&s;es, will deny the force of a common law maxim. One cannot but &s;mile at the incon&s;i&s;tency of the&s;e inherent, inde|fea&s;ible men: If one of them has a &s;uit at law, in any part of <HI>New-England,</HI> upon a que&s;tion of land property, or merchandize, he appeals to the common law, to &s;upport his claim, or defeat his adver&s;ary; and yet is &s;o profoundly &s;tupid as to &s;ay, that an act of parliament does not bind him; when, perhaps, the &s;ame page in a law book, which points him out a remedy for a libel, or a &s;lap in the face, would in|form him that it does.&mdash;In a word, The force of an act of parliament, over the colonies, is predicated upon the common law, the origin and ba&s;is of all tho&s;e inherent rights and privileges which con&s;titute the boa&s;t and felicity of a <HI>Briton.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="010011_0010_0F7B98C222AF97C8">Can we claim the common law as an inheritance, and at the &s;ame time be at liberty to adopt one part of it, and reject the other? Indeed we cannot: The common law, pure and indivi&s;ible in its nature and e&s;&s;ence, cleaves to us during our lives, and follows us from <HI>Nova Zembla</HI> to <HI>Cape Horn.</HI> And therefore, as the juri&s;diction of parliament ari&s;es out of, and is &s;upported by it, we may as well renounce our alle|giance, or change our nature, as to be exempt from the juri&s;diction of parliament: Hence, it is plain to me, that in denying this juri&s;diction, we at the &s;ame time, take leave of the common law, and thereby, with equal temerity and folly, &s;trip our&s;elves of every ble&s;&s;ing we enjoy as <HI>Engli&s;hmen:</HI> A flagrant proof this, that &s;hallow draughts in politicks and legi&s;lation confound and di&s;tract us, and that an extravagant zeal often defeats its own purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>I am aware that the foregoing rea&s;oning will be oppo&s;ed by the maxim, <Q>That no <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> can be taxed but by his own con&s;ent, or by repre&s;entatives.</Q></P>
<P>It is this dry maxim, taken in a literal &s;en&s;e, and ill under&s;tood, that, like the &s;ong of <HI>Lillibullero,</HI> has made all the mi&s;chief in the colonies: And upon this, the partizans of the colonies rights chiefly re&s;t their cau&s;e. I don't de&s;pair, however, of convincing you, that this maxim affords but little &s;upport to their argument, when rightly examined and explained.</P>
<P>It is the opinion of the hou&s;e of commons, and may be con&s;idered as a law of parliament, that they are the repre&s;entatives of every <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ubject, where&s;o|ever he be. In this view of the matter then, the aforegoing maxim is fully vindicated in practice, and the whole benefit of it, in &s;ub&s;tance and effect, ex|tended and applied to the <HI>colonies.</HI> Indeed the maxim
<PB N="12" REF="010011_0011_0F7B98C28F2ED358">
mu&s;t be con&s;idered in this latitude, for in a literal &s;en&s;e or con&s;truction it ever was, and ever will be, im|practicable. Let me a&s;k, is the i&s;le of <HI>Man, Jer&s;ey,</HI> or <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> repre&s;ented? What is the value or amount of each man's repre&s;entation in the kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which contains near two millions of people, and yet not more than three thou&s;and have votes in the election of members of parliament? But to &s;hew &s;till further, that, in fact and reality, this right of repre&s;entation is not of that con&s;equence it is gene|rally thought to be, let us take into the argument the moneyed intere&s;t of <HI>Britain,</HI> which, though immen&s;ely great, has no &s;hare in this repre&s;entation; a worthle&s;s freeholder of forty &s;hillings <HI>per annum</HI> can vote for a member of parliament, whereas a merchant, tho' worth one hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, if it con&s;i&s;t only in per&s;onal effects, has no vote at all: But yet let no one &s;uppo&s;e that the intere&s;t of the latter is not equally the object of parliamentary attention with the former.&mdash;Let me add one example more: Copyholders in <HI>England</HI> of one thou&s;and pounds &s;ter|ling <HI>per annum,</HI> who&s;e e&s;tates in land are nominally, but not intrin&s;ically, inferior to a freehold, cannot, by law, vote for members of parliament; yet we never hear that the&s;e people <HI>"murmur with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive "fear, and mingled rage:"</HI> They don't &s;et up their private humour again&s;t the con&s;titution of their coun|try, but &s;ubmit with chearfulne&s;s to tho&s;e forms of government which providence, in its goodne&s;s, has placed them under.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e that this <HI>Utopian</HI> privilege of repre&s;enta|tion &s;hould take place, I que&s;tion if it would an&s;wer any other purpo&s;e but to bring an expence upon the colonies, unle&s;s you can &s;uppo&s;e that a few <HI>American</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="010011_0012_0F7B98C2F324D988">
members could bias the deliberations of the whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> legi&s;lature. In &s;hort, this right of repre&s;entation is but a phantom, and, if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in its full extent, would be of no real advantage to the colonies; they would, like <HI>Ixion,</HI> embrace a cloud in the &s;hape of <HI>Juno.</HI></P>
<P>In addition to this head, I could further urge the danger of innovations; every change in a con&s;tituti|on, in &s;ome degree, weakens its original frame; and hence it is that legi&s;lators and &s;tate&s;men are cautious in admitting them: The goodly building of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> con&s;titution will be be&s;t &s;ecured and perpetuated by adhering to its original principles. Parliaments are not of ye&s;terday, they are as antient as our <HI>Saxon</HI> ance&s;tors. Attendance in parliament was originally a duty ari&s;ing from a tenure of lands, and grew out of the feudal &s;y&s;tem; &s;o that the privilege of &s;itting in it, is territorial, and confined to <HI>Britain</HI> only. Why &s;hould the beauty and &s;ymmetry of this body be de&s;troyed, and its purity defiled, by the unnatural mixture of repre&s;entatives from every part of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> dominions. <HI>Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and the dwellers of Me&s;opotamia, &amp;c.</HI> would not, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, &s;peak the &s;ame language. What a heterogene|ous council would this form? what a mon&s;ter in government would it be?&mdash;In truth, my friend, the matter lies here: The freedom and happine&s;s of every <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ubject depends, not upon his &s;hare in electi|ons, but upon the &s;en&s;e and virtue of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parlia|ment, and the&s;e depend reciprocally upon the &s;en&s;e and virtue of the whole nation. When virtue and honour are no more, the lovely frame of our con|&s;titution will be di&s;&s;olved. <HI>Britain</HI> may one day be what <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> now are; but may heaven long protract the hour!</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="010011_0013_0F7B98C3C7BF8928">The juri&s;diction of parliament being e&s;tabli&s;hed, it will follow, that this juri&s;diction cannot be apporti|oned; it is tran&s;cendant and entire, and may levy in|ternal taxes as well as regulate trade; there is no e&s;&s;ential difference in the rights: A &s;tamp duty is confe&s;&s;edly the mo&s;t rea&s;onable and equitable that can be devi&s;ed, yet very far am I from de&s;iring to &s;ee it e&s;tabli&s;hed among us, but I fear the &s;haft is &s;ped, and it is now too late to prevent the blow.</P>
<P>The examples cited by his honour, with regard to ancient colonies, may &s;hew his reading and erudition, but are of no authority in the pre&s;ent que&s;tion. I am not enough &s;killed in the <HI>Grecian</HI> hi&s;tory to correct the proofs drawn from thence, though they amount to very little. If the <HI>Grecian</HI> colonies, as his honour &s;ays, <Q>took &s;uch forms of government as them&s;elves cho&s;e,</Q> there is no kind of &s;imilitude between them and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colonies, and therefore to name them is nothing to the purpo&s;e. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colonies take their forms of government from the crown; hold their privileges upon condition, that they do not abu&s;e them; and hold their lands by the tenure of common &s;ocage, which involves in it fealty and obe|dience to the king: Hence it is plain, his honour's argument is not &s;trengthened by the example of the <HI>Grecian</HI> colonies; for what likene&s;s is there between independant colonies, as tho&s;e mu&s;t be, which <Q>took &s;uch forms of government as them&s;elves cho&s;e,</Q> and colonies like ours, which are in a manner feudatory, and holden of a &s;uperior.</P>
<P>With regard to the <HI>Roman</HI> colonies, I mu&s;t beg leave to &s;ay, that the honourable author, either igno|rantly or wilfully, mi&s;takes the facts: A little more enquiry, or a little more candour, would have con|vinced
<PB N="15" REF="010011_0014_0F7B98C4748F3EF8">
him, that the <HI>Roman coloniae</HI> did not enjoy all the rights of <HI>Roman</HI> citizens; on the contrary, they only u&s;ed the <HI>Roman</HI> laws and religion, and &s;erved in the legions, but had not the right of &s;uffrage, or of bearing honours. In the&s;e re&s;pects, our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colo|nies exactly re&s;emble them; we enjoy the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> laws and religion, but have not the right of fuffrage, or of bearing honours in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and indeed our &s;ituation renders it impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>If the practice of the ancients was of any authority in this ca&s;e, I could name examples to ju&s;tify the en|&s;laving of colonies. The <HI>Carthaginians</HI> were a free people, yet they, to render the <HI>Sardinians</HI> and <HI>Cor&s;icans</HI> more dependant, forbad their planting, &s;owing, or doing any thing of the like kind, under pain of death, &s;o that they &s;upplied them with nece&s;&s;aries from <HI>Africa:</HI> This was indeed very hard. But there is &s;omething extremely weak and inconclu&s;ive in recur|ring to the <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> hi&s;tory for examples to illu&s;trate any particular favourite opinion: If a de|ference to the ancients &s;hould direct the practice of the moderns, we might &s;ell our children to pay our debts, and ju&s;tify it by the practice of the <HI>Athenians.</HI> We might lend our wives to our friends, and ju&s;tify it from the Example of <HI>Cato,</HI> among the <HI>Romans.</HI> In a word, my dear Sir, the belly of a &s;ow, pickled, was a high di&s;h in ancient <HI>Rome;</HI> and I imagine, as you advance in the refinements of luxury, this will become a capital part of a <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> fea&s;t, &s;o fond you &s;eem of ancient cu&s;toms and laws.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of wandring in the labyrinth of ancient co|lonies, I would advi&s;e his honour to read the debates in parliament in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and thirty-three, when Mr. <HI>Partridge,</HI> your agent,
<PB N="16" REF="010011_0015_0F7B98C54116BF60">
petitioned the commons again&s;t the then &s;ugar-bill; he will there find more &s;atisfaction upon the &s;ubject of colonies, than in <HI>Thucydides's hi&s;tory of the Pelopenne&s;ian war.</HI> It was declared in the cour&s;e of that debate, that the coloni&s;ts were a part of the peo|ple of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> and, as &s;uch, fully repre&s;ented in that hou&s;e. The petition then pre&s;ented by Mr. <HI>Partridge,</HI> was of a very different temper from tho&s;e now &s;ent home by the colonies; it was extremely mode&s;t, and only intimated that the &s;ugar bill, if pa&s;&s;ed into a law, might be prejudicial to their charter; at the bare mention of this Sir <HI>William Yonge</HI> took fire, and &s;aid, <Q>It looked like aiming at an independency, and di&s;claiming the juri&s;diction of that hou&s;e, as if <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> this hou&s;e had not a power to tax the colo|nies.</Q> Mr. Winnington, <HI>with equal warmth, added,</HI> <Q>I hope they have no charter which debars this hou&s;e from taxing them, as well as any other &s;ubject of the nation.</Q> Here you have the opinion of two of the mo&s;t eminent members of that time; they &s;poke the &s;en|timents of the whole hou&s;e, and the&s;e &s;entiments &s;till continue the &s;ame. And from hence you may per|ceive, how little pro&s;pect there is of the colonies gain|ing any point upon the footing of the&s;e new &s;uppo&s;i|titious rights; broaching &s;uch opinions will excite the jealou&s;y of the parliament, and you will be looked upon with an evil eye. The promoters of &s;uch doctrines are no friends to the colonies, whatever may be their preten&s;ions. Can his honour be &s;o vain as to imagine, that ten thou&s;and &s;uch pamphlets as his, will influence the parliament, or that they will be per&s;uaded, by the force of his elocution, to give up their &s;upremacy, and right of taxing the colonies. What purpo&s;e then can be &s;erved by the&s;e pamphlets, but to embitter the minds of a &s;imple, credulous, and hitherto loyal peo|ple,
<PB N="17" REF="010011_0016_0F7B98C5F08710B0">
and to alienate their affections from <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> their be&s;t friend, their protector, and <HI>alma mater.</HI> A different behaviour would be much more prudent and politick. If we have any thing to a&s;k, we &s;hould remember that diffidence and mode&s;ty will always obtain more from generous minds, than frowardne&s;s and impertinence.</P>
<P>The act of the thirteenth of his late maje&s;ty, entitled, <HI>An act for naturalizing of foreign prote&s;tants,</HI> had better have been omitted by his honour; for if that act is to be the mea&s;ure of the coloni&s;ts rights, they will be more circum&s;cribed than he would wil|lingly chu&s;e. In that act, there is a provi&s;o, that no per&s;on, who &s;hall become a natural born &s;ubject by vir|tue of that act, &s;hould be of the privy council, or a mem|ber of either hou&s;e of parliament, or capable of en|joying, in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> any place of tru&s;t, civil or military, &amp;c. This &s;tatute confirms the di&s;|tinction I have &s;et up between per&s;onal and political rights. After naturalization, foreign prote&s;tants are here admitted &s;ubjects, to all intents and purpo&s;es; that is, to the full enjoyment of tho&s;e rights which are connected with the per&s;on, liberty or e&s;tate of <HI>Engli&s;hmen;</HI> but by the provi&s;o, they are excluded from bearing offices or honours.</P>
<P>Enlarging the power of the court of admiralty, is much complain'd of by the honourable author. I &s;hall open my mind to you freely on this head.</P>
<P>It is notorious, that &s;muggling, which an eminent writer calls a crime again&s;t the law of nature, had well nigh become e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;ome of the colonies. Acts of parliament had been uniformly di&s;pen&s;ed with by tho&s;e who&s;e duty it was to execute them; corruption, rai&s;ed upon the ruins of duty and virtue, had almo&s;t grown into a &s;y&s;tem; courts of admiralty, confined
<PB N="18" REF="010011_0017_0F7B98C6E55DB068">
within &s;mall territorial juri&s;dictions, became &s;ub|ject to mercantile influence; and the king's revenue &s;hamefully &s;acrificed to the venality and perfidiou&s;ne&s;s of courts and officers.&mdash;If, my friend, cu&s;toms are due to the crown; if illicit commerce is to be put an end to, as ruinous to the welfare of the nation:&mdash; If, by rea&s;on of the intere&s;ted views of traders, and the connivance of courts and cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, the&s;e ends could not be compa&s;&s;ed or obtained in the common and ordinary way; tell me, what could the government do, but to apply a remedy de&s;perate as the di&s;ea&s;e: There is, I own, a &s;everity in the method of pro&s;ecution, in the new e&s;tabli&s;hed court of admi|ralty, under Doctor <HI>SPRY,</HI> here; but it is a &s;eve|rity we have brought upon our&s;elves. When every mild expedient, to &s;top the atrocious and infamous practice of &s;muggling, has been try'd in vain, the government is ju&s;tifiable in making laws again&s;t it, even like tho&s;e of <HI>Draco,</HI> which were written in blood. The new in&s;tituted court of admiralty, and the power given to the &s;eizer, are doubtle&s;e intended to make us more circum&s;pect in our trade, and to confine the merchant, from motives of fear and dread, within the limits of a fair commerce. <Q>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con&s;train the merchant, but it is in favour of commerce,</Q> &s;ays the admired <HI>Secondat.</HI> This is the &s;pirit of the new regulations, both with regard to the employing of cutters, and the enlarged power of the admiralty; and both mea&s;ures are ju&s;tifiable upon the &s;ame prin|ciples, as is the late act for preventing murder, which executes and di&s;&s;ects the murderer at &s;urgeons-hall in twenty-four hours after conviction.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of this act, let me add, that no harm can accrue to the hone&s;t and fair

trader, &s;o long as the crown fills the admiralty de|partment with an upright judge; &s;uch a one is Doctor <HI>SPRY,</HI> an able civilian, and who&s;e appointments place him above any kind of influence; yet the honourable author of the pamphlet before me, has told us to this effect; That it is very well known this judge <HI>can be prevailed on, very ea&s;ily,</HI> to certify, upon the acquittal of a &s;eizure, that there was a probable cau&s;e for making it.&mdash;So &s;hamefully intemperate is his honour's zeal and oppo&s;ition to every mea&s;ure adopted by the government at home, that he &s;pares not even private characters, however worthy and re|&s;pectable. I fear he knows not the high value of a good name, and how dear it is to men of &s;entiment and honour.</P>

<P>To &s;u&s;pect the integrity of others, is not the effu&s;ion of a virtuous mind. Tho&s;e who have been long u&s;ed to traffick with judges and juries, are, from the depravity of their own hearts, ea&s;ily led to believe others even as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This libel upon Doctor <HI>SPRY,</HI> contained in a pamphlet <HI>publi&s;hed by authority,</HI> may &s;pread over the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dominions, and, however fal&s;e and &s;candalous it be, yet may leave a &s;hade upon his character which can never be effaced. With what grace, let me a&s;k you, do &s;uch reflections as the&s;e come from the governor of a colony, where, all the world agree, the law has &s;carcely yet dawned, and where all your legal rights are decided by the &s;trength of that faction which happens to be uppermo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="010011_0019_0F7B98C909E56AB0">I am not enough &s;killed in trade to know whether the act, &s;o much complained of, will do mo&s;t good or mo&s;t harm; and I wi&s;h others were as diffident of their knowledge in this particular. To compre|hend the general trade of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> nation, much exceeds the capacity of any one man in <HI>America,</HI> how great &s;oever he be. Trade is a va&s;t, compli|cated &s;y&s;tem, and requires &s;uch a depth of genius, and extent of knowledge, to under&s;tand it, that little minds, attached to their own &s;ordid intere&s;t, and long u&s;ed to the greate&s;t licentiou&s;ne&s;s in trade, are, and mu&s;t be, very incompetent judges of it. Sir <HI>Andrew Freeport</HI> is no inhabitant of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> colony. For my own part, I am &s;till willing to leave the manage|ment of trade with that people, who, according to the &s;ame admired author ju&s;t quoted, <Q>know better than any other people upon earth, how to value at the &s;ame time the&s;e three great advantages, religion, com|merce, and liberty.</Q></P>
<P>Here I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that, from the intelli|gence I have gained, the beloved article of mela&s;&s;es is now plentier and cheaper, in all the <HI>New-England</HI> colonies, than when it was avowedly &s;muggled; and &s;o far is the linen manufacture of <HI>Ireland</HI> from being ruined, as his honour intimates, that never was a greater demand for flax-&s;eed than during the la&s;t fall, notwith&s;tanding the clau&s;e in the act relating to lumber. How &s;en&s;ele&s;s is it to imagine that the pro|hibiting a few dunnage &s;laves to be carried to <HI>Ireland,</HI> will ruin the manufactures of that kingdom.</P>
<P>Believe me, my Friend, it gives me great pain to &s;ee &s;o much ingratitude in the colonies to the mo|ther country, who&s;e arms and money &s;o lately re&s;|cued them from a <HI>French</HI> government. I have been told, that &s;ome have gone &s;o far as to &s;ay, that they
<PB N="21" REF="010011_0020_0F7B98C9AE5C4D28">
would, as things are, prefer &s;uch a government to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> one.&mdash;Heaven knows I have but little malice in my heart, yet, for a moment, I ardently wi&s;h that the&s;e &s;purious, unworthy &s;ons of <HI>Britain</HI> could feel the iron rod of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> inqui&s;itor, or a <HI>French</HI> farmer of the revenue; it would indeed be a puni&s;hment &s;uited to their ingratitude. Here I can|not but call to mind the adder in one of the fables of <HI>Pilpay,</HI> which was preparing to &s;ting the generous traveller who had ju&s;t re&s;cued him from the flames.</P>
<P>You'l ea&s;ily perceive, that what I have &s;aid is upon the general de&s;ign of his honour's pamphlet; if he had divided his argument with any preci&s;ion, I would have followed him with &s;omewhat more of method; The di&s;pute between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the colonies con&s;i&s;ts of two parts; fir&s;t, the juri&s;diction of parlia|ment,&mdash;and, &s;econdly, the exerci&s;e of that juri&s;dic|tion. His honour hath blended the&s;e together, and no where marked the divi&s;ion between them: The fir&s;t I have principally remarked upon: As to the &s;econd, it can only turn upon the expediency or uti|lity of tho&s;e &s;chemes which may, from time to time, be adopted by parliament, relative to the colonies. Un|der this head, I readily grant, they are at full liberty to remon&s;trate, petition, write pamphlets and news|papers, without number, to prevent any improper or unrea&s;onable impo&s;ition: Nay, I would have them do all this with that &s;pirit of freedom which <HI>Engli&s;h|men</HI> always have, and I hope ever will, exert; but let us not u&s;e our liberty for a cloak of maliciou&s;ne&s;s. Indeed I am very &s;ure the loyalty of the colonies has ever been irreproachable; but from the pride of &s;ome, and the ignorance of others, the cry again&s;t mother country has &s;pread from colony to colony;
<PB N="22" REF="010011_0021_0F7B98CD54B95FC8">
and it is to be feared, that prejudices and re&s;entments are kindled among them which it will be difficult ever, thoroughly, to &s;ooth or extingui&s;h. It may be|come nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upreme legi&s;lature of the na|tion to frame &s;ome code, and therein adju&s;t the rights of the colonies, with preci&s;ion and certainty, other|wi&s;e <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will always be teazed with new claims about liberty and privileges.</P>
<P>I have no ambition in appearing in print, yet if you think what is here thrown together is fit for the publick eye, you are at liberty to publi&s;h it: I the more chearfully acquie&s;ce in this, becau&s;e it is with real concern I have ob&s;erved, that, notwith&s;tanding the frequent abu&s;e poured forth in pamphlets and news-papers again&s;t the mother country, not one filial pen in <HI>America</HI> hath, as yet, been drawn, to my knowledge, in her vindication.</P>
