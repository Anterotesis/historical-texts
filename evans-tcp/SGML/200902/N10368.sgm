<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent ill-humour in America, and of the Re&s;olutions taken there to purcha&s;e le&s;s of our manufac|tures, does not &s;eem to be generally under|&s;tood, it may afford &s;ome &s;atisfaction to you, if I give them the following &s;hort hi&s;torical &s;tate of facts.</P>
<P>From the time that the colonies were fir&s;t con&s;idered as capable of granting aids to the Crown, down to the end of the la&s;t war; it is &s;aid that the con&s;tant mode of obtaining tho&s;e aids was by requi&s;ition made from the Crown through its Governors to the &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies,
<PB N="2" REF="013147_0003_0F8EBE4A08EBEB98">
in circular letters from the Secretary of State in his Maje&s;ty's name, &s;etting forth the occa|&s;ion, requiring them to take the matter into con&s;ideration, and expre&s;&s;ing a reliance on their prudence, duty and affection to his Maje&s;ty's government, that they would grant &s;uch &s;ums, or rai&s;e &s;uch numbers of men, as were &s;uitable to their re&s;pective circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The colonies being accu&s;tomed to this me|thod, have from time to time granted money to the Crown, or rai&s;ed troops for its &s;ervice, in proportion to their abilities, and, during all the la&s;t war, beyond their abilities, &s;o that con&s;iderable &s;ums were returned them yearly by Parliament, as exceeding their proportion.</P>
<P>Had this happy method been continued (a method which left the King's &s;ubjects in tho&s;e remote countries the plea&s;ure of &s;hewing their zeal and loyalty, and of imagining that they recommended them&s;elves to their Sovereign by the liberality of their voluntary grants) there is no doubt but all the money that could rea|&s;onably be expected to be rai&s;ed from them, in any manner, might have been obtained from them, without the lea&s;t heart-burning, of|fence, or breach of the harmony of affections and intere&s;ts that &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two countries.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="013147_0004_0F8EBE4AA715DC00">It has been thought wi&s;dom in a government, exerci&s;ing &s;overeignty over different kinds of people, to have &s;ome regard to prevailing and e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions among the people to be governed, wherever &s;uch opinions might in their effects promote or ob&s;truct public mea|&s;ures.&mdash;If they tend to ob&s;truct public &s;ervice, they are to be changed before we act again&s;t them, and they can only be changed by rea&s;on and per&s;ua&s;ion.&mdash;But if public &s;ervice can be carried on without thwarting tho&s;e opinions, if they can be on the contrary made &s;ub&s;ervient to it, they are not unnece&s;&s;arily to be thwart|ed, how ab&s;urd &s;oever &s;uch popular opinions may be in their natures.</P>
<P>This had been the wi&s;dom of our govern|ment, with re&s;pect to rai&s;ing money in the colonies. It was well known that the colo|ni&s;ts univer&s;ally were of opinion, that no mo|ney could be levied from Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, but by their own con&s;ent, given by them&s;elves or their cho&s;en repre&s;entatives. That therefore, whatever money was to be rai&s;ed from the people in the colonies, mu&s;t fir&s;t be granted by their a&s;&s;emblies, as the money rai&s;ed in Britain is fir&s;t to be granted by the Hou&s;e of Commons. That this right of granting their own money was e&s;&s;ential to Engli&s;h liberty; and that if any man, or body of men, in which they had no repre&s;entative of their choo&s;ing,
<PB N="4" REF="013147_0005_0F8EBE4B8C64A350">
could tax them at plea&s;ure, they could not be &s;aid to have any property, any thing they could call their own. But as the&s;e opinions did not hinder their granting money voluntarily and amply, whenever the Crown, by its &s;ervants, came into their a&s;&s;emblies (as it does into its Parliaments of Britain and Ireland) and de|manded aids, therefore that method was cho&s;|en, rather than the baneful one of arbitrary taxes.</P>
<P>I do not undertake here to &s;upport tho&s;e opinions; they have been refuted by a late act of Parliament, declaring its own power; which very Parliament, however, &s;hewed wi&s;e|ly &s;o much tender regard to tho&s;e inveterate prejudices, as to repeal a tax that had odiou&s;|ly militated again&s;t them.&mdash;And the&s;e preju|dices are &s;till &s;o fixed and rooted in the Ame|ricans, that it is &s;uppo&s;ed not a &s;ingle man among them has been convinced of his error by that act of parliament.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ter, therefore, who fir&s;t projected to lay a&s;ide the accu&s;tomed method of requi|&s;ition, and to rai&s;e money on America by &s;tamps, &s;eems not to have acted wi&s;ely in de|viating from that method (which the coloni&s;ts looked upon as con&s;titutional) and thwarting unnece&s;&s;arily, the general fixed prejudices of &s;o great a number of the King's &s;ubjects. It was
<PB N="5" REF="013147_0006_0F8EBE4C2979E798">
not, however, for want of knowledge that what he was about to do would give them great offence; he appears to have been very &s;en&s;ible of this, and apprehen&s;ive that it might occa&s;ion &s;ome di&s;orders, to prevent or &s;uppre&s;s which he projected another bill, that was brought in the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion with the &s;tamp act, whereby it was to be made lawful for military officers in the colonies to quarter their &s;oldiers in private hou&s;es. This &s;eemed intended to awe the people into a compliance with the other act. Great oppo&s;ition, however, being rai&s;ed here again&s;t the bill, by the agents from the colonies, and the merchants trading thi|ther, the coloni&s;ts declaring that, under &s;uch a power in the army, no one could look on his hou&s;e as his own, or think he had a home, when &s;oldiers might be thru&s;t into it, and mix|ed with his family, at the plea&s;ure of an officer, that part of the bill was dropt; but there &s;till remained a clau&s;e, when it pa&s;&s;ed into a law, to oblige the &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies to provide quarters for the &s;oldiers, furni&s;hing them with fire, beds, candles, &s;mall beer or rum, and &s;undry other articles, at the expence of the &s;e|veral provinces.&mdash;And this act continued in force when the &s;tamp-act was repealed, though, if obligatory on the a&s;&s;emblies, it equally mi|litated again&s;t the American principle above|mentioned, that money is not to be rai&s;ed on Engli&s;h &s;ubjects without their con&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="013147_0007_0F8EBE5109F7F4C8">The colonies neverthele&s;s, being put into high good humour by the repeal of the &s;tamp-act, cho&s;e to avoid a fre&s;h di&s;pute upon the other, it being temporary, and &s;oon to expire, never (as they hoped) to revive again; and in the mean time they, by various ways, provided for the quartering of the troops, either by acts of their own a&s;&s;emblies without taking notice of the acts of Parliament, or by &s;ome variety or &s;mall diminution (as of &s;alt and vinegar) in the &s;upplies required by the Act, that what they did might appear a voluntary act of their own, and not done in obedience to an act of parlia|ment, which they thought contrary to right, and therefore void in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It might have been well if the matter had thus pa&s;&s;ed without notice; but an officious Governor having written home an angry and aggravating letter upon this conduct in the a&s;|&s;embly of his province, the outed projector of the &s;tamp-act, and his adherents, then in the oppo&s;ition, rai&s;ed &s;uch a clamour again&s;t Ame|rica, as in rebellion, &amp;c. and again&s;t tho&s;e who had been for the repeal of the &s;tamp-act, as having thereby been encouragers of this &s;uppo&s;|ed rebellion, that it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to enforce the quartering act by another act of Parliament, taking away from the province of New-York, which had been mo&s;t explicit in its refu&s;al, all the powers of legi&s;lation, till it
<PB N="7" REF="013147_0008_0F8EBE521E172FA0">
&s;hould have complied with that act: The news of which greatly alarmed the people every where in America, as the language of &s;uch an act &s;eemed to be Obey implicitly laws made by the Parliament of Great Britain, to force mo|ney from you without your con&s;ent, or you &s;hall enjoy no rights or privileges at all.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the late Chancellor of the Exchequer, de&s;irous of ingratiating him&s;elf with the oppo&s;ition, or driven to it by their clamours, projected the levying more money from America, by new duties on various ar|ticles of our own manufacture, as gla&s;s, paper, painters colours, &amp;c. appointing a new board of cu&s;toms, and &s;ending over a &s;et of commi&s;|&s;ioners (with large &s;alaries) to be e&s;tabli&s;hed at Bo&s;ton, who were to have the care of col|lecting the&s;e duties; and which were, by the act, expre&s;sly mentioned to be intended for the payment of the &s;alaries of Governors, Jud|ges, and other officers of the Crown in Ame|rica, it being a pretty general opinion here, that tho&s;e officers ought not to depend on the people there for any part of their &s;upport.</P>
<P>It is not my intention to combat this opi|nion; but perhaps it may be &s;ome &s;atisfaction to you to know what ideas the Americans have on the &s;ubject. They &s;ay then, as to Go|vernors, that they are not like Princes who&s;e

po&s;terity have an inheritance in the govern|ment of a nation, and therefore an intere&s;t in its pro&s;perity; they are generally &s;trangers to the provinces they are &s;ent to govern; have no e&s;tate, natural connection, or relation there, to give them an affection for the country; that they come only to make money as fa&s;t as they can, are frequently men of vicious characters and broken fortunes, &s;ent merely to get them off the hands of a mini&s;ter &s;omewhere out of the way; as that they intend &s;taying in the country no longer than their government con|tinues, and purpo&s;e to leave no family behind them, they are apt to be regardle&s;s of the good will of the people, and care not what is &s;aid or thought of them after they are gone. Their &s;ituation gives them many opportunities of be|ing vexatious, and they are often &s;o, notwith|&s;tanding their dependance on the a&s;&s;emblies for all that part of their &s;upport that does not ari&s;e from fees e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, but would probably be much more &s;o if they were to be fully &s;upported by money drawn from the people, without the con&s;ent or good will of the people, which is the profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of this act. That if by means of the enforced duties, government is to be &s;upported in Ame|rica, without the intervention of the a&s;&s;em|blies, their a&s;&s;emblies will &s;oon be looked upon as u&s;ele&s;s, and a Governor will not call them, as having nothing to hope from their meeting,

and perhaps &s;omething to fear from their en|quiries into, and remon&s;trances again&s;t his mal-admini&s;tration; that thus the people will be deprived of their mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential rights; that its being, as at pre&s;ent, a Governor's intere&s;t to cultivate the good will, by promoting the welfare of the people he governs, can be at|tended with no prejudice to the Mother-Coun|try, &s;ince all the laws he may be prevailed to give his a&s;&s;ent to, are &s;ubject to a revi&s;ion here, and if reported again&s;t by the Board of Trade, as hurtful to the intere&s;t of this country, may, and are immediately repealed by the Crown; nor dare he pa&s;s any law contrary to his in|&s;tructions, as he holds his office during the plea&s;ure of the Crown, and his Securities are liable for the penalties of their bonds, if he contravenes tho&s;e in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>This is what they &s;ay as to Governors.</P>
<P>As to Judges, they alledge, that being ap|pointed from hence by the Crown, and hold|ing their commi&s;&s;ions, not during good beha|viour, as in Britain, but during plea&s;ure, all the weight of intere&s;t would be thrown into one of the &s;cales (which ought to be held even) if the &s;alaries are al&s;o to be paid out of duties forced from the people without their con&s;ent, and independent of their A&s;&s;emblies approbation or di&s;approbation of the Judges
<PB N="10" REF="013147_0011_0F8EBE53B8C55728">
behaviour; that where the Crown will grant commi&s;&s;ions to able and hone&s;t Judges during good behaviour, the A&s;&s;emblies will &s;ettle per|manent and ample &s;alaries on them during their commi&s;&s;ions; but at pre&s;ent they have no other means of getting rid of an ignorant, unju&s;t Judge (and &s;ome of &s;candalous characters have, they &s;ay, been &s;ent them) but by &s;tarving him out.</P>
<P>I do not &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e rea&s;onings of the Americans will have much weight in them. I do not produce them with an expectation of convincing you. I relate them merely in pur|&s;uance of the ta&s;k I have impo&s;ed on my&s;elf, to be an impartial Hi&s;torian of American facts and opinions.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THE Coloni&s;ts being greatly alarmed, as I ob&s;erved in my la&s;t, by news of the act for aboli&s;hing the legi&s;lature of New-York, and the impo&s;ition of the&s;e new duties, profe&s;&s;edly for &s;uch di&s;agreeable, and to them appearing dangerous purpo&s;es; accompanied by a new &s;et of Revenue officers, with large appointments, which gave &s;trong &s;u&s;picion
<PB N="11" REF="013147_0012_0F8EBE54E4770D70">
that more bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;ame kind was &s;oon to be provided for them, that they might earn tho&s;e &s;alaries, began &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider their &s;ituation, and to revolve afre&s;h in their minds, grievances, which from their re&s;pect and love for this country, they had long borne, and &s;eemed almo&s;t willing to forget. They re|flected how lightly the intere&s;ts of all Ame|rica had been e&s;teemed here, when the intere&s;t of a few inhabitants of Great-Britain happened to have the &s;malle&s;t competition with it. That thus the whole American people were forbidden the advantage of a direct im|portation of wine, oil, and fruit from Portugal, but mu&s;t take them loaded with all the ex|pences of a voyage of one thou&s;and leagues round about, being to be landed fir&s;t in Eng|land, to be re-&s;hipped for America: expences amounting, in war-time, at lea&s;t to thirty per cent. more than otherwi&s;e they would have been charged with, and all this, merely that a few Portugal merchants in London might gain a commi&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e goods pa&s;&s;ing through their hands.&mdash;Portugal Merchants, by the bye, who complain loudly of the &s;mal|e&s;t hard&s;hips laid on their trade by foreigners, and yet even the la&s;t year, could oppo&s;e with all their influence the giving ea&s;e to their fel|low-&s;ubjects under &s;o heavy an oppre&s;&s;ion&mdash; That on a frivolous complaint of a few Vir|ginia Merchants, nine colonies were re&s;trained
<PB N="12" REF="013147_0013_0F8EBE553438A700">
from making paper-money, though become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for their internal com|merce, from the con&s;tant remittance of their gold and &s;ilver to Britain.&mdash;But not only the intere&s;t of a particular body of merchants, the intere&s;t of any &s;mall body of Briti&s;h trade&s;|men or artificers, has been found, they &s;ay, to outweigh that of all the King's &s;ubjects in the colonies.</P>
<P>There cannot be a &s;tronger natural right than that of a man's making the be&s;t profit he can of the natural produce of his lands, pro|vided he does not thereby injure the State in general. Iron is to be found every where in America, and beaver furs are the natural pro|duce of that country. Hats and nails, and &s;teel, are wanted there as well as here. It is no importance to the common welfare of the Empire, whether a &s;ubject gets his living by making hats on this or that &s;ide of the water; yet the hatters of England have prevailed! &s;o far as to obtain an act in their own favour, re|&s;training that manufacture in America, in or|der to oblige the Americans to &s;end their bea|ver to England, to be manufactured, and pur|cha&s;e back the hats loaded with the charges of a double tran&s;portation. In the &s;ame man|ner have a few Nail-makers, and &s;till a &s;maller number of Steel-makers (perhaps there are not half a dozen of the&s;e in England) prevailed
<PB N="13" REF="013147_0014_0F8EBE55F5E96FF8">
totally to forbid, by an act of Parliament, the erecting of &s;litting-mills, and &s;teel-furnaces in America, that the Americans may be obliged to take nails for their buildings, and &s;teel for their tools from the&s;e artificers under the &s;ame di&s;advantages. Added to the&s;e, the Americans remembered the act authorizing the mo&s;t cruel in&s;ult that perhaps was ever offered by one people to another, that of emptying our gaols into their &s;ettlements (Scotland too, has within the&s;e few years, obtained the pri|vilege it had not before, of &s;ending its rogues and villains to the plantations) an in&s;ult ag|gravated by that barbarous, ill-placed &s;arca&s;m in a report of the Board of Trade, when one of the provinces complained of the act. <Q>It is nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be continued for the better peopling of your Maje&s;ty's colo|nies.</Q> I &s;ay, reflecting on tho&s;e things, the Americans &s;aid to one another (their news papers are full of di&s;cour&s;es) the&s;e people are not content with making a monopoly of us, forbidding us to trade with any other country of Europe, and compelling us to buy every thing of them, though in many articles we could furni&s;h our&s;elves 10, 20, and even 50 per cent. cheaper el&s;ewhere; but now they have as good as declared they have a right to tax us, <HI>ad li|bitum,</HI> internally and externally; and that our con&s;titution and liberties &s;hall all be taken away if we do not &s;ubmit to that claim. They
<PB N="14" REF="013147_0015_0F8EBE56AA696048">
are not content with the high prices at which they &s;ell us their goods, but have now begun to enhance tho&s;e prices by new duties; and by the expen&s;ive apparatus of a new &s;et of offi|cers, they appear to intend an augmentation and multiplication of tho&s;e burthens that &s;hall &s;till be more grievous to us. Our people have been fooli&s;hly fond of their &s;uperfluous modes and manufactures, to their impoveri&s;hing our country, carrying off all our ca&s;h, and loading us with debt; they will not &s;uffer us to re&s;train the luxury of our inhabitants as they do that of their own, by laws; they can make laws to di&s;courage or prohibit the importation of French &s;uperfluities; but though tho&s;e of England are as ruinous to us as the French ones are to them; if we make a law of that kind, they immediately repeal it. Thus they get all our money from us by trade, and every profit we can any where make by our fi&s;hery, our produce, and our commerce, centers fi|nally with them! But this does not &s;atisfy. It is time then to take care of our&s;elves, by the be&s;t means in our power. Let us unite in &s;olemn re&s;olutions and engagements with and to each other, that we will give the&s;e new offi|cers as little trouble as po&s;&s;ible by not con&s;um|ing the Briti&s;h manufactures, on which they are to levy the duties. Let us agree to con|&s;ume no more of their expen&s;ive gew-gaws; let us live frugally; and let us indu&s;triou&s;ly
<PB N="15" REF="013147_0016_0F8EBE5782DF4A60">
manufacture what we can for our&s;elves; thus we &s;hall be able honourably to di&s;charge the debts we already owe them, and after that, we may be able to keep &s;ome money in our coun|try, not only for the u&s;es of our internal com|merce, but for the &s;ervice of our gracious Sovereign, whenever he &s;hall have occa&s;ion for it, and think proper to require it of us in the old con&s;titutional manner. For notwith|&s;tanding the reproaches thrown out again&s;t us in the public papers and pamphlets; notwith|&s;tanding we have been reviled in their Senate as rebels and traitors, we are truly a loyal people. Scotland has had its rebellions, and England its plots, again&s;t the pre&s;ent royal fa|mily; but America is untainted with tho&s;e crimes; there is in it &s;carce a man, there is not a &s;ingle native of our country who is not firmly attached to his King by principle and by affection. But a new kind of loyalty &s;eems to be required of us, a loyalty to Parliament; a loyalty that is to extend, it &s;eems, to a &s;ur|render of all our properties, whenever a Hou&s;e of Commons, in which there is not a &s;ingle member of our choo&s;ing, &s;hall think fit to grant them away without our con&s;ent, and to a patient &s;uffering the lo&s;s of our privileges as Engli&s;h|men, if we cannot &s;ubmit to make &s;uch &s;urren|der. We were &s;eparated too far from Britain by the ocean, but we were united &s;trongly to it by re&s;pect and love, &s;o that we could at any time
<PB N="16" REF="013147_0017_0F8EBE58647EFCB0">
freely have &s;pent our lives and little fortunes in its cau&s;e; but this unhappy new &s;y&s;tem of politics tends to di&s;&s;olve tho&s;e bands of union, and to &s;ever us forever. Woe to the man that fir&s;t adopted it! Both countries will long have cau&s;e to execrate his memory.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the wild ravings of the at pre&s;ent half di&s;tracted Americans. To be &s;ure no rea&s;onable man in England can approve of &s;uch &s;entiments, and, as I &s;aid before, I do not pretend to &s;upport or ju&s;tify them; but I &s;incerely wi&s;h, for the &s;ake of the manufactures and commerce of Great-Britain, and for the &s;ake of the &s;trength a firm union with our growing colonies would give us, that tho&s;e people had never been thus needle&s;sly driven out of their &s;en&s;es.</P>
