<P>Stand in awe, and Sin not &mdash;.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GOD Calls upon us <HI>this Day</HI> to <HI>Stand in awe of Him;</HI> for He hath terribly &s;haken the Earth under us, and threatn'd to &s;end us down quick into the Pit. At the &s;ame time, He al&s;o encourageth us to <HI>Hope in His Mercy.</HI> We might have been &s;uddenly de&s;troy'd, and that without remedy. Ye&s;terday might have been the la&s;t Sabbath, and the la&s;t Opportunity of hearing GOD &s;peaking to us in His Word; but Adored be the divine Patience &amp; Long-&s;uffering! Our gracious LORD hath cho&s;en rather to Warn us by a very aw|ful Providence, and then to give a further &s;pace for Repentance. O that His Goodne&s;s might lead us to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. We are now <HI>A&s;&s;embled</HI> in His Name and Fear, to humble our &s;elves under GOD's Mighty Hand, to Cry to Him to turn from the Fiercene&s;s of His Angery, and to Prai&s;e Him for his wonderful Deliverance O that I could speak, and you Hear under the deep impre&s;|&s;ion of tho&s;e Things!</P>
<P>The Penman of this P&s;alm was <HI>David;</HI> the Oc|ca&s;ion of it is uncertain. It &s;eems to have been made <Q>when he was di&s;&s;re&s;s'd either by <HI>Ab&s;alem,</HI> or <HI>Saul</HI> or by &s;ome other great and powerful <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></Q>

<PB N="2" REF="002954_0004_0FE6A4BDAAF2E750">The words of my Text are rendred and under&s;tood by learned Men with &s;ome variety. The Word, &s;ays a worthy <HI>Divine</HI> &s;ignifies any moving of the Heart; the <HI>Septuagint</HI> render it, Be angry, and Sin not. Which Words being us'd by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> Eph. 4.26. are &s;uppos'd by &s;ome to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a Quotation from this P&s;alm. Others render it by word which &s;igni|fies to tremble or &s;hake for fear <HI>Pi&s;cator</HI> gives the &s;en&s;e thus; Be mov'd with fear of the anger of GOD. Which is agreeable to our own <HI>Ver&s;ion,</HI> Stand in Awe. There is al&s;o &s;ome difference among <HI>Expo&s;itors</HI> re|&s;pecting the Per&s;ons to whom the&s;e words are directed. Some think they are directed to his Enemies, that they &s;hou'd fear GOD and not Sin again&s;t Him by their oppo&s;ition to <HI>David's</HI> Per&s;on and Government, who was anointed by GOD's e&s;pecial Direction and Com|mand. Others rather under&s;tand the words as direct|ed to his Friends, that they &s;hou'd &s;tand in awe of GOD's terrible Maje&s;ty under their di&s;tre&s;&s;ing troubles, and not &s;in by murmuring again&s;t GOD, or taking any forbidden Cour&s;es to Extricate them&s;elves. However it is plain, that the&s;e words are &s;poken to a profe&s;&s;ing People in a time of Calamity, and I may from them ob&s;erve this Doctrine,</P>
<Q>DOCT. <HI>IT is the Duty of particular Per&s;ons and of a Profe&s;&s;ing People in times of great Di&s;tre&s;s, to Stand in Awe of GOD, and not Sin.</HI></Q>
<P>IT is our Duty at all times to <HI>fear that glorious and fearful Name, the LORD our GOD,</HI> and e&s;pecially when He di&s;plays his terrible Maje&s;ty in awful Judgments, we &s;hou'd then look above Second Cau&s;es, and obey that word which GOD &s;pake to his People in a time when their Hearts were ready to fail them for fear, I&s;a. 8.12, 13. <HI>Say ye not, a Confe|deracy,&mdash; Sanctifie the Lord of Ho&s;ts him&s;elf, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</HI> We
<PB N="3" REF="002954_0005_0FE6A4BDC6B5E928">mu&s;t at &s;uch a time Sanctifie the Lord of Ho&s;ts &mdash; We mu&s;t have our minds impre&s;s'd with an holy awe, a reverential fear of his terrible Maje&s;ty, and give him the Glory of his infinite Power, Ju&s;tice, Holine&s;s, Faithfulne&s;s and Mercy, and other admirable Perfecti|ons which &s;hine forth in his judicial Di&s;pen&s;ations; and in that &s;ea&s;onable help which he affords his Peo|ple under them; In&s;tead of being Slavi&s;hly afraid of Evil, which fear brings a &s;nare. We &s;hou'd Exerci&s;e a religious filial fear of GOD as <HI>Job</HI> &s;aid, Job 23.15. <HI>When I con&s;ider, I am afraid of him.</HI> We &s;hould be deeply concern'd, and afraid at the tokens of GOD's di&s;plea&s;ure, <HI>Even when his Wrath is kindled but a little, and begins to burn;</HI> when he gives us to &s;ing both of Mercy and Judgment. And being mov'd with fear of GOD's di&s;plea&s;ure, we &s;hou'd put away our Sins which &s;tir up his Anger, and are the ground of the Controver&s;y between GOD and us. We &s;hould be afraid of offending GOD by breaking his Command|ments, and accordingly &s;hould Repent of, and put far away tho&s;e Sins wereby we have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed his Law. Surely it is meet to be &s;aid unto GOD at &s;uch a time, <HI>I have born Cha&s;ti&s;ement, I will not offend any more. That which I &s;ee not, teach thou me; if I have done Iniquity, I will do no more,</HI> Job 34.31, 32. It is the Duty of a Per&s;on or a People thus to &s;tand in Awe, and not Sin; to Fear the Lord and depart from Evil. Here, I wou'd in a practical way, and with a particular Application to our &s;elves, Con&s;ider &s;everal Sins which a Per&s;on or People under threat|ning Judgments &s;hou'd put away in the Exerci&s;e of an holy Awe of GOD, and dread of his righteous Di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WE &s;hou'd &s;tand in Awe of GOD, and not Sin by Impenitency &amp; Unbelief.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a very comprehen&s;ive <HI>Head,</HI> however I &s;hall give it a di&s;tinct Con&s;ideration. When GOD is coming out in Judgments again&s;t us, We &s;hould
<PB N="4" REF="002954_0006_0FE6A4BF21D1E9C8">humble our &s;elves under his mighty hand, loath our &s;elves for our iniquities, and repent in du&s;t and a&s;hes. Thus GOD &s;aid to his People of old, Jer. 2.19. <HI>Thine own wickedne&s;s &s;hall correct thee, and thy back&s;lidings &s;hall reprove thee: know therefore and &s;ee, that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou ha&s;t for&s;aken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, &s;aith the Lord God of ho&s;ts.</HI> Afflictions &s;hould teach us the evil of Sin, and make that mo&s;t bitter which is the procuring cau&s;e of them. When GOD is threatning us we &s;hould open our ears to di&s;cipline, and from an affecting &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of the evil and danger, the filthine&s;s and odiou&s;ne&s;s of Sin, heartily grieve becau&s;e we have offended GOD by breaking his Law, and putting away our Sin, &s;hou'd turn to him. As <HI>Ephra|im</HI> bemoan'd him&s;elf thus, <HI>Thou ha&s;t cha&s;ti&s;ed me, and I was cha&s;ti&s;ed, Surely after that I was turned I repented; and after that I was in&s;tructed, I &s;mote upon my thigh: I was a&s;hamed, yea, even confound|ed, becau&s;e I did bear the reproach of my youth,</HI> Jer. 31.18, 19. Again, we &s;hou'd &s;tand in awe, and not Sin by <HI>Unbelief.</HI> This is a very heinous Sin, 1 John 5.10. <HI>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witne&s;s in him&s;elf: he that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, becau&s;e he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.</HI> And it is highly di&s;plea&s;ing to GOD, and upon the account of it GOD is provok'd to bring terrible Judgments upon a profe&s;&s;ing People. Thus when the <HI>Son of God</HI> was manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, and came to his own, they re|ceived him not. The Body of the Jewi&s;h Nation rejected the true <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and then GOD ca&s;t them off, and poured out his Wrath upon them in a mo&s;t terrible manner, Rom. 11.20. <HI>Becau&s;e of unbelief they were broken off</HI> &mdash;. When GOD is come out in terrible Judgments again&s;t us, we &s;hould therefore be convinced of Sin, particularly of this great Sin of not believing in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and take heed there be
<PB N="5" REF="002954_0007_0FE6A4BF46120FD8">not in any of us <HI>an evil Heart of unbelief.</HI> We &s;hould give glory to GOD by receiving the record he hath given of his Son, as a faithful &s;aying and worthy of all acceptation, and re&s;t upon Chri&s;t and his righte|ou&s;ne&s;s as reveal'd and held forth in the word of the Go&s;pel, for Ju&s;tification and Eternal Life. Let us then &s;tand in awe of GOD, while under the tokens of his di&s;plea&s;ure, repent and turn from all our tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions; &s;o iniquity &s;hall not be our ruin. Let us, being mov'd with fear fly to Je&s;us Chri&s;t who is the hope of his I&s;rael and the Saviour thereof in times of trouble. Let us not give our gracious Lord rea&s;on to complain as of Jeru&s;alem, Matt. 23.37. <HI>O Jeru|&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, thou that kille&s;t the Prophets and &s;tone&s;t them which are &s;ent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy Children together even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, and ye would not.</HI> But let us now fly to Chri&s;t and tru&s;t under his Shadow, who is <HI>an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempe&s;t:</HI> I&s;a. 32.2.</P>

<P>THE Keeping of a <HI>Weekly Sabbath,</HI> or Day of holy Re&s;t to the LORD is of Divine and Perpetual Obli|gation, as the Fourth Commandment declares. The Fir&s;t Day of the Week &s;ince CHRIST's Re&s;urrection on that Day, is the Sabbath; as appears by the Practice of the Apo&s;tles who were divinely in&s;pired, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e Matters which were of general concern to the Church: Act. 20.7. <HI>And upon the fir&s;t day of the week, when the Di&s;ciples came to|gether to break bread, 'Paul preached unto them</HI> &mdash;. 1 Cor. 16.1, 2. &mdash; <HI>Upon the fir&s;t day of the week, let every one of you lay by him in &s;tore, as God hath pro&s;pered him</HI> &mdash;. And this is agreably call'd, <HI>The
<PB N="8" REF="002954_0010_0FE6A4CC5DFAFCE0">Lord's Day,</HI> Rev. 1.10. Now GOD requires his People, to whom He gives his <HI>Sabbath</HI> as a Sign, to Sanctify it by Re&s;ting from all Unnece&s;&s;ary Worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s, and from Recreations lawful at other times, And then by &s;pending the whole time, unle&s;s when works of Nece&s;&s;ity or Mercy take us off, in the Secret, Private &amp; Publick Wor&s;hip of GOD. It is our Privilege that we have the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> and very &s;trong are our Obligations <HI>to Remember, and keep it Holy:</HI> unle&s;s we do it, Religion will langui&s;h, and GOD will be provoked to bring terrible Judgments upon us. Jer. 17.21, 24, 27. <HI>Thus &s;aith the LORD, Take heed to your &s;elves, and bear no burden on the Sab|bath-day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jeru&s;alem. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, if ye diligently hearken unto me, &s;aith the Lord, to bring in no burden through the gates of this City on the Sabbath-Day, but hallow the Sabbath-Day, to do no work therein. But if ye will not hearken unto me, to hallow the Sabbath-Day, and not to bear a burden, even en|tring in at the gates of Jeru&s;alem on the Sabbath|Day: then will I kindle a Fire in the gates thereof, and it &s;hall devour the palaces of Jeru&s;alem, and it &s;hall not be quenched.</HI> Let us then take care and Sanctify the Lords-Day. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD the &s;trict ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath has been no &s;mall part of the glory of NEW-ENGLAND, and of BOSTON: O let us take heed and beware of every thing that would &s;tain this glory! Let us therefore remember the Sabbath, and bear it in mind, e&s;pecially when it draws nigh, that we may be di&s;intangled from all Worldly Cares, and ready to enter into this holy Re&s;t.</P>
<P>In the Scriptural Account of the Creation, the Darkne&s;s is reckon'd before the Light of the Natural Day. And the Evening and the Morning were the Second Day, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.8. Agreable to this the Jewi&s;h Sab|hath was from Evening to Evening, <HI>Lev.</HI> 23.32. And <HI>Nehemiah</HI> commanded the Gates to be &s;hut when it
<PB N="9" REF="002954_0011_0FE6A4CC81A1B1B0">began to be dark before the Sabbath, <HI>Neh.</HI> 13.19. which by rea&s;on of the Mountains round about and near <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &s;eems to have been about Sun|&s;etting at furthe&s;t. The Chri&s;tian Sabbath is the fir&s;t Day of the Week. And it mu&s;t begin as other Days. As to the exact Time of CHRIST's Re&s;urrection, it is not &s;et forth in Scripture.</P>
<P>LET us then di&s;patch our Worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s towards the Evening, before the Sabbath Day. Such as are in Trade, &s;hou'd take Care that their Shops be &s;hut &s;ea&s;onably. Such as have Meat or any other things to buy, &s;hould take Care to do it before Night. Or whatever <HI>Secular Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> is to be done, we ought to fini&s;h it &s;o that we may not be cumber'd about it, when we &s;hould be keeping an <HI>holy Re&s;t</HI> to the Lord. On the <HI>Lord's Day Morning,</HI> we &s;hould ri&s;e early, if our bodily Health will allow it, and take Care that we and our Hou&s;holds &s;eparate a whole Day for the Service of GOD; and that we do not thro' Covetou&s;ne&s;s allow them in any unnece&s;&s;ary worldly Labour. There mu&s;t be no <HI>Burden</HI> born on the Sabbath, No! not &s;o much as to &s;etch or carry any wearing Apparel: yea on this Day the Bea&s;ts mu&s;t Re&s;t from Labor <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <Q><HI>Thou &s;halt not do any Work, thou nor thy Cattle</HI> partly to teach us to exerci&s;e Mercy toward the brute Creatures, partly becau&s;e the u&s;e of Cattle mu&s;t have drawn along with it the Atten|dance or Employment of Men.</Q> The Re&s;t of Man and Bea&s;t mu&s;t not be interrupted without weighty Cau&s;e. We mu&s;t look to it that it be a Work of Nece&s;&s;ity or Mercy, or el&s;e we may not employ Men about it.</P>
<P>Again, As we mu&s;t take Care that our Children and Servants be not Idle at home; &s;o <HI>that they attend the Publick Wor&s;hip.</HI> GOD requires that we &amp; ours appear before him to do him <HI>Homage</HI> on this Day, and we mu&s;t take Care to go up to the
<PB N="10" REF="002954_0012_0FE6A4D884CC2E10">Hou&s;e of the Lord; and we mu&s;t not neglect the A&s;&s;embling our &s;elves together on this Day: We mu&s;t &s;ee to it that our Seat be not Empty; and that our Children &amp; Servants do not ab&s;ent them&s;elves; unle&s;s when Sickne&s;s, the nece&s;&s;ary Occa&s;ions of the Family, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> require it. And tho' it be true, that the Sabbath is but one Day in the Week: yet there is Prudence to be u&s;ed on the Evening after the Sabbath-Day, that we do not lo&s;e what we have wrought or got on the Lord's Day, by going Abroad into vain Company, by vi&s;its of meer Ceremony, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but rather Employ the Time in Catechi&s;ing our Children &amp; Servants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>LET us then be Exhorted to Keep the Sabbath holy. Let us turn away our foot from the Sabbath, from doing our Plea&s;ure on GOD's holy Day.

<P>Now then, that GOD hath cau&s;ed our Hou&s;es to &s;hake under us, and threaten'd to bury us in the Ruins of them; let us be excited to Wor&s;hip GOD con&s;tantly in and with our Families.

<PB N="21" REF="002954_0023_0FE6A4F2F2984D10">again&s;t them, <HI>Exod.</HI> 32.10. But then you mu&s;t <HI>Watch</HI> as well as <HI>Pray,</HI> and u&s;e your be&s;t Endeavours to promote the nece&s;&s;ary Work of Reformation, accor|ding to the Place you are in, and in the faithful Im|provement of the Advantages GOD puts into your Hands. You mu&s;t have <HI>no fellow&s;hip with the un|fruitful Works of darkne&s;s; but rather reprove them.</HI> O look to GOD then for fre&s;h Influences of his Spi|rit, and &s;tir up the Grace of GOD in you. Be zea|lous &amp; active in GOD's Service, and Exemplary in all holy Conver&s;ation. Such Per&s;ons are under GOD, the Strength and Safety of a People. Had there been <HI>ten Righteous</HI> in <HI>Sodom,</HI> GOD wou'd have &s;par'd it, <HI>Gen:</HI> 18.32. I hope there are many <HI>hundreds</HI> in in this Land. The Lord increa&s;e their Number, and pour out the Spirit of Grace and Supplication more abundantly upon them.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>LET our</HI> Young People <HI>Fear the Lord, and flee youthful Lu&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>HERE is a loud Call to you, to <HI>Remember your Creator in the days of your Youth;</HI> for you lie as much expos'd to this threatned Judgment as the Aged, and can no more e&s;cape it. O turn at GOD's <HI>Re|proo&s;</HI> then, <HI>le&s;t he laugh at your Galamity, and mock when your fear cometh,</HI> when your fear cometh as de&s;olation &mdash; <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.26, 27. You are apt to pre|&s;ume of many days; but now GOD teacheth you that <HI>&s;udden 'De&s;truction</HI> may come upon you. Do you then hear and fear and turn to the Lord. Seek CHRIST early; Receive him without delay, <HI>That you may have power to become the Sons of GOD,</HI> Joh. 1.12. Then you may go to GOD as to your <HI>reconciled Father</HI> when in di&s;tre&s;s. But if you now de&s;pi&s;e the Son of GOD, and neglect his great Salva|tion, there will be dreadful Rea&s;on to Fear, that GOD will utterly for&s;ake you in the evil Day. Be intrea|ted therefore, O <HI>young People,</HI> to con&s;ider of your
<PB N="22" REF="002954_0024_0FE6A4FCDB59E078">ways, and turn your feet to GOD's Te&s;timonies. GOD in his Word and by his Providence &s;peaks to you as, Eccl. 11.9. <HI>Rejoyce, O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the &s;ight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all the&s;e things God will bring thee into judgment.</HI> It is at your ut|mo&s;t Peril if you go on in the ways of Sin, after &s;uch loud Calls and fair Warnings. Now then, for&s;ake the fooli&s;h and live; hearken to the Lord, that you may dwell &s;afely, and be quiet from fear of Evil, <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.33.</P>
<P>IN a word, <HI>LET us all be quicken'd to make ready for the Coming of our Lord.</HI></P>
<P>WE learn from this <HI>&s;urpri&s;ing Providence</HI> that we know not how &s;uddenly our Lord may come to us <HI>by Death,</HI> and call us to appear before Him. Let us not then be at re&s;t till we can in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> Acts 21.13. <HI>I am ready to die.</HI> And who can tell how near the <HI>glorious Appearing</HI> of the SON OF GOD may be? <HI>Earthquakes</HI> are nam'd among the <HI>Signs</HI> of our <HI>Lord's Coming,</HI> Matth. 24.7.29, 30. <HI>Great Events</HI> have been attended with them; as our Saviour's <HI>Crucifixion,</HI> Matth. 27.51, 54. Upon which they &s;aid, <HI>Truly this was the Son of God.</HI> His <HI>Re&s;urrection,</HI> Matth. 28.2. And are we not directed to expect terrible <HI>Convul&s;ions in Na|ture</HI> before our Lord's <HI>&s;econd Coming,</HI> 2 Pet. 3.10, 12. And that it will be very &s;udden and &s;urpri&s;ing to a &s;ecure World. <HI>Matth.</HI> 24.36,&mdash;39. O let us then &s;tand with our Loins girt, and Lamps burning, as they that wait for the Coming of the Lord! <HI>Let us be diligent that we may be found of our Judge in Peace, without &s;pot &amp; blamele&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, <HI>LET us Cry to GOD to pour out his Spirit upon us,</HI> that we may Obey his Voice, and make an <HI>holy Improvement</HI> of this awful Di&s;|pen&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="002954_0025_0FE6A4FCF1C58BF0">
THE mo&s;t extraordinary Means will be ineffectual without GOD's Ble&s;&s;ing communicated by his Spirit. And &s;urely, <HI>It is time to &s;eek the Lord, till he come and rain Righteou&s;ne&s;s upon you,</HI> Ho&s;. 10.12. We are undone without this; for we &s;hall grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e under the mo&s;t awakening Judgments, till we are ripe for Ruin. Let us then thir&s;t after this comprehen&s;ive <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> and ask it of our <HI>Heavenly Father,</HI> who is ready to be&s;tow it upon diligent Seekers, <HI>Luke</HI> 11.13. And let us offer up our Re|que&s;ts to GOD in the <HI>Name</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, who hath received the <HI>Promi&s;e of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> We read, Acts 4.31. <HI>When they had prayed the Place was &s;haken where they were a&s;&s;em|bled together: and they were all filled with the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> O that this <HI>&s;haking</HI> we have felt might be follow'd with a plentiful Effu&s;ion of the Spirit, to convince us of our many heinous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, to Convert &amp; Reform us! This wou'd take away the ground of the Controver&s;y, and give us good rea&s;on to expect all needed Salvation from the light of GOD's Countenance. Ezek. 39.29. <HI>Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my &s;pirit upon the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, &s;aith the Lord God.</HI></P>
<P>USE, II. <HI>LET us ble&s;s GOD who hath not bro't upon us the De&s;truction we fear'd, but de|liver'd us from going down to the Pit.</HI></P>
<P>THIS amazing Judgment hath in a great mea&s;ure de&s;troy'd other <HI>populous Towns.</HI> They have &s;unk under the weight of GOD's Anger, and been &s;wallow'd up. When as we are &s;haken indeed and terrified; but without any great Damage. Let our Hearts then be deeply affected with this wonderful Deliverance, and our Mouths fill'd with the high Prai&s;es of the great GOD our Saviour. But let us not grow &s;ecure, as if the bitterne&s;s of Death was wholly pa&s;t; for GOD can ea&s;ily cau&s;e the Judgment to ri&s;e up again, and
<PB N="24" REF="002954_0026_0FE6A50190AB26A0">as an <HI>over&s;lowing Scourge</HI> that &s;hall bear down all before it, and make the Land de&s;olate. O let not our Ingratitude under &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hing a Mercy, provoke Him; but let us render to the Lord accor|ding to his Benefits.</P>
<P>USE, III. <HI>LET &s;uch as &s;tand in Aw of GOD, Encourage them&s;elves in him, and hope in his Mercy.</HI> P&s;al. 147.11. <HI>The Lord taketh plea&s;ure in them that fear him, in tho&s;e that hope in his mercy.</HI> You that dread GOD's di&s;plea&s;ure, and fly from Sin as the wor&s;t of Evils, &s;hou'd fear nothing with amazement; but &s;hou'd have your <HI>hearts fixed tru&s;ting in the Lord,</HI> I&s;a. 41.10. <HI>Fear thou not, for I am with thee: be not di&s;mayed, for I am thy God: I will &s;trengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> GOD is your <HI>Father;</HI> and your <HI>Redeemer</HI> is mighty, having all Power in Heaven &amp; Earth. Do you therefore receive and obey that Command, Joh. 14.1. <HI>Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe al&s;o in me.</HI> Tru&s;t and Rejoice in CHRIST JESUS, who &s;aves to the uttermo&s;t. Depend on his watchful powerful Provi|dence, who is the Head over all things to the Church. And then, Let your Hearts be in tune, to &s;ing the 46th P&s;al. <HI>God is our refuge &amp; &s;trength, a very pre|&s;ent help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, tho' the earth be removed, and tho' the mountains be car|ried into the mid&s;t of the &s;ea.</HI> For GOD will help you, and that right early. You that fear the Lord &s;hou'd <HI>Tru&s;t in the Name of the Lord, and &s;tay upon your God,</HI> I&s;a. 50.10. Even in your darke&s;t Hours; for he is a pre&s;ent help in Trouble. Thus you may Live in holy Security &amp; Peace, without being tor|mented with anxious Cares &amp; Fears, and may &s;ay with the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 4.8. <HI>I will both lay me down in peace, and &s;leep: for thou Lord only make&s;t me dwell in &s;afety.</HI></P>
