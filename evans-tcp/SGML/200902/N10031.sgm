<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>SOME things which were but ju&s;t touched, or con&s;ider|ed only in a general way, in the examination of Mr. Edwards, require a further and particular examination: And other things need a more di&s;tinct explanation: His denial of moral, rational liberty; his di&s;tinction of natu|ral and moral nece&s;&s;ity; attributing the origin of evil to the want or withdraw of divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;eperating the obliquity of &s;in from its cau&s;e; are &s;ome of the points that require a further <HI>examination.</HI> And tho&s;e that need a more di&s;tinct <HI>explanation</HI> are the doctrine of human liberty as maintained by the examiner, and the con&s;i&s;tency thereof with admitting the operation of motives in the choice and determinations of moral agents.</P>
<P>The examiner hath the &s;ame opinion &s;till of the intri|cacy of the &s;ubject as was expre&s;&s;ed in his former publica|tion, and means to proceed in it with caution and diffi|dence. If he may be &s;o happy as to ca&s;t any light on the ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ubject of liberty and nece&s;&s;ity, or re&s;cue it in any important re&s;pect from its ob&s;curity, his time will not be ill-employed. But the main thing in view all along has been to vindicate the moral character of the Deity from the injurious repre&s;entations, either of de&s;igning, or well-meaning but mi&s;taken men.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="012746_0004_0F8BED8A788C5950">The &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ity, in oppo&s;ition to &s;elf-determi|nation, cannot, he thinks, be defended on the principles of revelation or thei&s;m, if this one thing be admitted, that God is not the cau&s;e of moral evil. If it be affirmed, that he is the efficient cau&s;e of it, his moral perfections are de|nied. If moral agents them&s;elves are the efficient cau&s;e, this is to admit &s;elf-determination.</P>
<P>Some maintain only an hypothetic liberty. On their principles nece&s;&s;ity may be tenable&mdash;<HI>provided</HI> there is nei|ther holine&s;s nor &s;in in the creation of God&mdash;no being wor|thy of moral complacence or di&s;plicence, prai&s;e or blame.</P>
<P>The examiner begs the reader to keep in mind this &s;ingle que&s;tion, <HI>Whether Mr. Edwards's doctrine makes God the efficient cau&s;e of all moral wickedne&s;s?</HI> He is him&s;elf clear in the affirmative of the que&s;tion, or would not have undertaken to examine Mr. Edwards's book. If this &s;hould al&s;o be the reader's opinion, it is pre&s;um'd the &s;cheme which contains or concludes in this will be re|jected. To reduce a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> writer to this is &s;ufficient, without going any further. Nor will there be occa&s;ion to &s;hew how different &s;uch a &s;cheme is from the &s;entiments of tho&s;e who have been e&s;teemed orthodox in the pure&s;t times of the church: It is with no great propriety, that Mr. Edwards makes it the caption of almo&s;t every &s;ection, that his foundation principles are the doctrines of <HI>Calvin|i&s;m;</HI> and the oppo&s;ite <HI>Arminiani&s;m. Pelagiani&s;m,</HI> &amp;c. Were it indeed &s;o, what other purpo&s;e can this &s;erve than to ca&s;t an odium, and fix a per&s;onal <HI>&s;tigma?</HI> But in truth, when have Calvini&s;ts maintain'd, that the vicious wills of moral agents are derived from God, and unalterably fixed by his efficiency? that the fir&s;t exi&s;tence of &s;in aro&s;e from the witholding his influence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance? Should it al&s;o appear that Mr. Edwards's doctrine leaves no room for a di&s;tinction between rational and animal creatures in re&s;pect of liberty and agency&mdash;that it concludes in favour of the mechani&s;m of the human mind, this is a ba&s;is on which Calvini&s;ts have not built their &s;cheme of doctrine.</P>
<P>In &s;ome parts of the en&s;uing performance, the examiner hath been obliged to be more ab&s;tru&s;e than was his own choice; &s;ome readers might otherwi&s;e have thought him
<PB N="vii" REF="012746_0005_0F8BED8B3B432C50">
wanting in re&s;pect to Mr. Edwards, who&s;e book is repleat with &s;uch rea&s;oning; abundant pains being taken this way to deduce his adver&s;aries to ab&s;urdity. But whate|ver propriety there may be in oppo&s;ing metaphy&s;ics to metaphy&s;ics, yet the examiner would a&s;&s;ure the reader, he hath taken care not to &s;ub&s;titute any metaphy&s;ics of his own for truth; but hath endeavoured to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome <HI>plain</HI> things on what he takes to be the real truth in the pre&s;ent debate. He de&s;ires the reader would excu&s;e a few things that may appear ab&s;tru&s;e, and hopes the greater part of what he hath written will be thought &s;ufficiently clear, and adapted to do &s;ome good. The whole calls for the public candor, which he would not forfeit by writing with a &s;our temper.</P>
<P>He hath not been at all intimidated by the opinion or arguments of his remarker, who thinks <Q>the grand pillars of Mr. Edwards's doctrine &s;tand firm and un&s;haken.</Q> Nor hath he any apology to make for undertaking to ex|amine Mr. Edwards's book. Tis enough, that the ex|aminer treated "this great man" with no di&s;repect in his fir&s;t publication, and determines not to in the pre&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. On Self-determination.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall fir&s;t explain the doctrine of human li|berty in the &s;en&s;e in which we maintain it. Se|condly, Make a few cur&s;ory ob&s;ervations on Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme of liberty.</P>
<P>Power, motion and agency are terms of various &s;ignifi|cation. The two fir&s;t are frequently u&s;ed in mechanics, and all of them may be applied to animal creatures. "Power may re&s;ide in a &s;ubject that is no agent; as in the ca&s;e of phy&s;ical or natural powers."</P>
<P>When we &s;peak of the motions and revolutions of in|animate bodies, it may amount to the &s;ame thing at la&s;t, whether we attribute the&s;e to an e&s;tabli&s;hed original law of nature, or to the con&s;tant agency of the Deity upon matter. The cour&s;e of nature is the con&s;titution of the author of nature. It is demon&s;trably not &s;o fixed as to preclude &s;pecial divine interpo&s;ition, whereby the opera|tion of &s;econd cau&s;es is &s;u&s;pended or counteracted. We cannot, indeed, determine how far this is the ca&s;e. Many events may be brought about (at lea&s;t in part) by &s;econd cau&s;es, which we may imagine belong to the head of &s;pe|cial interpo&s;itions, over-ruling tho&s;e cau&s;es. 'Tis difficult to a&s;certain the powers of nature, as well as tho&s;e of moral agents.</P>
<P>There is a &s;en&s;e in which <HI>there is no power but of God.</HI> And if any chu&s;e to &s;ay, that natural cau&s;es (&s;o called) are really no cau&s;e at all; that God actuates all the powers of nature, and that from his energy every effect in the natural world proceeds, we have no objection to make. We only de&s;ire it may be remembered, that mechanic powers, the motions of inanimate bodies, bear no re&s;emblance to, and give us no idea of, the powers of moral and accountable
<PB N="10" REF="012746_0007_0F8BED8CBA399038">
creatures. Shou'd one undertake to illu&s;trate con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s by the vibrations of a pendulum, it would not be more ridiculous than a pretence to explain the powers of human nature by the motions of the planets, the growth of vegetables, &amp;c. The&s;e are &s;o far from being any exem|plification of <HI>moral</HI> agency, that they bear no likene&s;s even to <HI>animal</HI> motion. For this is <HI>voluntary.</HI> And we pre|&s;ume it will not be &s;aid that voluntary motion is predi|cable of inanimate things&mdash;not even by tho&s;e <HI>philo&s;ophers</HI> who have re&s;embled the powers of moral nature to tho&s;e of material bodies.</P>
<P>Nor will the con&s;ideration of <HI>animal</HI> motion and agency, any more than the motions of inanimate bodies, afford us any proper illu&s;tration of moral agency. Voluntary mo|tion and exertion is indeed common to moral agents and the lower animals. The&s;e have natural power, foreca&s;te, memory, can move this way or that as <HI>they plea&s;e,</HI> or <HI>ac|cording to the determination of their will.</HI> They are agents&mdash; voluntary agents&mdash;'Tis apparent they "act electively"&mdash; from de&s;ign&mdash;to certain ends. They are capable of being taught many things. From the &s;agacity &s;ome of them di&s;cover, many have conjectur'd that they have an immor|tal &s;pirit, and are accountable. This, we apprehend, is going too far, and find Mr. Edwards concurs with us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 41.</NOTE> Whatever gradations there are in the creation, mankind appear to be the lowe&s;t order of <HI>intelligent moral</HI> agents. The appearances of rea&s;on in many of the brute creatures are ea&s;ily accounted for without &s;uppo&s;ing them po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a moral faculty&mdash;in much the &s;ame manner as we ac|count for many in&s;tances of the conduct of ideots, who never had the exerci&s;e of this faculty; of madmen, who have lo&s;t it; and of children before they arrive to the exerci&s;e of it. What they &s;ee and experience from day to day affords them in&s;truction, and influenceth their conduct, without their having any perception of good and evil in a <HI>moral</HI> view. The &s;ame holds, in a degree, in the inferior creatures. <HI>The ox knoweth his own|er, and the a&s;s his ma&s;ter's crib.</HI> And tho&s;e animals, who <HI>have no guide, over&s;eer or ruler,</HI> give proofs of &s;agacity and foreca&s;te, the con&s;ideration of which wou'd be of
<PB N="11" REF="012746_0008_0F8BED8D7B24ABB8">
u&s;e to many who have rea&s;on for their guide. The ani|mal creatures are al&s;o the &s;ubjects of certain internal di&s;|po&s;itions and affections. They have a common care and tenderne&s;s for their young. Some of the feebler &s;ort a&s;|&s;ociate for the double purpo&s;e of protection and com|mon u&s;efulne&s;s. Some kinds of them are of a fierce, ve|nomous, or ravenous di&s;po&s;ition; others are mild, gentle and harmle&s;s. "Spontaneous voluntary exertion" belongs to every &s;pecies of them. But though &s;pontaneous ani|mal motion may approach the neare&s;t to moral agency, of any thing in vi&s;ible nature; yet it is e&s;&s;entially diffe|rent thereform, nor doth it give us any proper idea there|of. A ju&s;t notion of moral agency we can derive only from attending to the nature and operations of the hu|man mind&mdash;not from a contemplation of inanimate or ani|mate nature. <HI>The in&s;piration of the Almighty hath given us under&s;tanding. I will prai&s;e thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvellous are thy works, and that my &s;oul knoweth right well. God created man in his own image.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eems, notwith&s;tanding, that &s;ome gentlemen need to be inform'd, that man hath a di&s;tinctive power from animals. We &s;cruple not to ri&s;que the whole controver&s;y on their being able to point out a difference, &s;till retaining their own principles.</P>
<P>Hard is our ta&s;k to be obliged to explain the difference between a man and a brute in regard of liberty and &s;elf-determination. Such minds as acknowledge no difference, we fear cannot be convinc'd. In regard to truths we are immediately con&s;cious of, every medium of proof, all rea|&s;oning, not only &s;eems needle&s;s, but rather &s;erves to ob|&s;cure than elucidate what is propo&s;ed to be proved. As tho' by removing the object to a greater di&s;tance, we wou'd obtain a more di&s;tinct and full view of it.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinctive faculty of moral agents we before en|deavoured to &s;tate and explain&mdash;and we think it was &s;hewn, that moral liberty really differs from animal, and that, "in finite beings placed upon trial, it implies an opportu|nity and capacity of chu&s;ing and acting otherwi&s;e than they in fact do."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Examination of Edwards, Part III. Sect. I.</NOTE> Further to illu&s;trate and confirm the
<PB N="12" REF="012746_0009_0F8BED8E3A541930">
&s;ame thing, we de&s;ire the capacity moral agents have of <HI>examining</HI> and <HI>con&s;idering</HI> before they make their choice, or proceed to act, in any given ca&s;e, may be well attended to. They can determine to con&s;ider the rea&s;onablene&s;s or unrea&s;onablene&s;s of any propo&s;ed object of choice&mdash;whe|ther it be con&s;i&s;tent with, or contrary to, their duty&mdash;whe|ther it be for their intere&s;t upon the whole&mdash;and con&s;e|quently, whether it is the part of wi&s;dom to chu&s;e or re|fu&s;e it. They have this power in regard to <HI>&s;peculative</HI> prin|ciples, as well as with re&s;pect to life and conduct. They can examine the nature and evidence of what is propo&s;ed to 'm for truth, and embrace or reject it as it &s;hall appear to be true or fal&s;e upon diligent and impartial en|quiry; or give it that weight which its greater or le&s;s im|portance &s;hall demand. Error in principle is one great &s;ource of men's practical deviations from the paths of righteou&s;ne&s;s. Hence it is, not infrequently, that they ju&s;tify and boa&s;t them&s;elves in a way that is not good, im|agining they are doing God &s;ervice, when in reality they are fighting again&s;t him. Now &s;o far as men judge wrong, and in con&s;equence thereof act wrong, thro' their own care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, or neglect, or through partiality in their enquiries af|ter truth; &s;o far they are criminal, and chargeable with all the practical con&s;equences of their wrong judgment. If the mi&s;takes of mankind on <HI>practical</HI> &s;ubjects are &s;earch|ed to the bottom, the probability is, that the greater part of &s;uch mi&s;takes will be found to proceed from that cau&s;e our Lord mentions, <HI>Every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lo&s;t his deeds &s;hou'd be re|proved.</HI> And this is their condemnation. For what hath that man to plead, who receives not the love of the truth, <HI>becau&s;e he hath plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s?</HI> From whatever cau&s;e men refu&s;e to examine the foundation and rea&s;ona|blene&s;s of tho&s;e religious principles they profe&s;s to main|tain, or reject; whether it be from education, intere&s;t, or partial affection; they are criminal, and mu&s;t an&s;wer it to him who has given them a capacity to di&s;cern the diffe|rence between right and wrong, good and evil&mdash;who has granted them the nece&s;&s;ary means of knowledge, and re|quires that they <HI>prove all things; and hold fa&s;t that which
<PB N="13" REF="012746_0010_0F8BED8EF7A15928">
is good</HI>&mdash;that they <HI>judge even of them&s;elves what is right.</HI> Had that rule, which &s;ome have laid down to them&s;elves and others, "fir&s;t <HI>determine</HI> and then <HI>examine,</HI>" been univer|&s;ally adopted, knowledge cou'd never have increa&s;ed&mdash; ignorance, &s;uper&s;tition and barbari&s;m mu&s;t have over|&s;pread the earth.</P>
<P>Then in matters which more immediately re&s;pect the <HI>heart and life,</HI> moral agents have the &s;ame power of ex|amining and attending to what is laid before them. Mo&s;t of their vicious elections and pur&s;uits probably proceed from want of attention and con&s;ideration. They have a power of reflecting&mdash;of acquainting them&s;elves which is the wi&s;e choice and cour&s;e. But they do not &s;top and con&s;ider what is before them&mdash;what choice they are about to make&mdash;what will be the con&s;equence in this world or another. Their conclu&s;ions are precipitate, and they proceed to action as the hor&s;e ru&s;heth into the battle. What &s;trikes their external &s;en&s;es, and promi&s;es a pre&s;ent gratification to their particular affections, lu&s;ts or pa&s;&s;ions, is wont to be greedily embrac'd and pur&s;ued&mdash;what re|quires &s;ome &s;elf-denial and mortification of the&s;e is quick|ly rejected, before that faculty, which is naturally &s;upream, and was given to direct and controul the bodily appetites, in&s;tincts and pa&s;&s;ions, can pa&s;s judgment in the ca&s;e. Wrong apprehen&s;ions, wrong affections and conduct, pro|ceeding in &s;o many in&s;tances as they manife&s;tly do from the neglect of rea&s;on and reflection, &s;hew of what va&s;t im|portance it is that moral agents &s;et down and con&s;ider be|fore they pa&s;s judgment, or make their election, and de|termine what cour&s;e to take, in things that concern them. Experience concurs with the &s;acred oracles in atte&s;ting, that the want of attention and examination is a principal &s;ource of the fatal mi&s;takes and mi&s;carriages of mankind: And how cou'd it be expected it &s;hou'd be otherwi&s;e, when the regulating faculty of our nature, in&s;tead of being im|prov'd in the &s;earch of truth and duty, is u&s;ed, if at all, as a &s;ervant to the &s;en&s;itive appetites? This is a like contra|diction in morals as it is in civil life to &s;ee &s;ervants on hor|&s;es, and princes walking like &s;ervants on the earth&mdash;or as if the feet &s;hould u&s;urp the place of the head in the natural body.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="012746_0011_0F8BED9145F4A0B0">When in any given ca&s;e it is dubious what cour&s;e is our duty to take, or wou'd be mo&s;t prudent all things con|&s;idered, by deliberating on the matter we may come to be clearly &s;atisfied; whereas if we proceed immediately to action, we are liable to err fatally&mdash;and &s;hou'd it be other|wi&s;e, we can't have the plea&s;ure of knowing that we are right&mdash;'tis accidental that we are &s;o&mdash;we merit no com|mendation, but rather de&s;erve blame for runing the hazard of being in the wrong, when we might have obtained full conviction had we been at the pains, and given our&s;elves time, to reflect a few moments.</P>
<P>Or &s;uppo&s;e the &s;en&s;e of duty is &s;ufficiently clear, but we are be&s;et by numerous and powerful temptations, have we not power to make a pau&s;e? By this means, we may ob|tain &s;uch a view of the particular evil to which we are en|ticed, &s;uch con&s;iderations may be &s;ugge&s;ted to our minds, as that a pre&s;ent temptation, however &s;trong, &s;hall not pre|vail, but gradually loo&s;e &s;trength and be overcome. Will you &s;ay that men in this ca&s;e have not power to forbear immediate action? to reflect a moment? Doubtle&s;s they have power to determine immediately with them&s;elves to con&s;ider the matter. E&s;pecially mu&s;t they be admitted to have this power, if we take into the account the operations of divine grace on their hearts. In this way many good tho'ts are often injected in the moment of danger. May they not be cheri&s;h'd, and made our own? By reflections on the nature of virtue and vice; their rewards and pun|i&s;hments pre&s;ent and future; the pa&s;t peaceable and hap|py fruits of the one; and contrary effects of the other, in our own experience, or ob&s;ervation of others; by re|flections on the moral perfections and government of God; the per&s;on and offices of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and calling to mind other con&s;iderations &s;ugge&s;ted by the oracles of truth, the force of a pre&s;ent temptation may be &s;peedily weakned thro' the influences of grace &s;ugge&s;ting and concuring with &s;uch moral con&s;iderations. While the force of con&s;cience is abated by &s;tifling it's remon&s;trances, and hearkning to the &s;ollicitations of lu&s;t and appetite in oppo&s;ition there|to; it's &s;en&s;ibility is, on the contrary, proportionably in|crea&s;ed by reflection and attention. Now to &s;ay that tho&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="012746_0012_0F8BED92285AD750">
who live very much without moral reflection and attenti|on; therefore cannot determine otherwi&s;e with them&s;elves, is implicitly to deny that they have the faculty of rea&s;on. They can deliberate on the means and opportunities of gratifying their lu&s;ts. What good rea&s;on can be offer'd to &s;hew they have not power to turn their meditations in|to another channel?</P>
<P>But as it is an important duty of moral agents to ac|cu&s;tom them&s;elves to diligent enquiry and mature con&s;ide|ration, that they may know what they ought to chu&s;e and pur&s;ue, and what to refu&s;e and avoid, and not act as the hor&s;e and mule who have no under&s;tanding&mdash;&s;o it &s;hou'd not be forgotten, that they &s;ometimes deliberate with a very different and oppo&s;ite view&mdash;not to di&s;cover their duty where it is doubtful, but to explain it away where it is plain. In ca&s;es where an uprignt mind can be at no lo&s;s, but makes immediate choice, a di&s;hone&s;t heart will he&s;itate, and, under a notion of deliberating in order to di&s;cover what may or ought to be done, contriveth ex|cu&s;es for the violation of a clear command. Sometimes great and &s;candalous vices are refined upon till they are tho't to be no vices; perhaps are transformed into vir|tues. Well were it if &s;ome men were as dexterous and ingenious, in calling to mind arguments to their duty as they are in finding out rea&s;ons again&s;t it, and means of darkning and perplexing the &s;en&s;e of it&mdash;as they are in the palliations and excu&s;es they contrive for their &s;ins, and in what they offer in ju&s;tification of them&s;elves. They had rather &s;in with their eyes &s;hut than with them open. Hence they take abundant pains to ob&s;cure the &s;en&s;e and mean|ing of the plaine&s;t commands, that they may po&s;&s;e&s;s the hope of religion, while they walk according to the cour&s;e of this world. A &s;ingle example will &s;et this matter in a &s;trong light. Balaam, we read, loved the wages of unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s, while he hoped to die the death of the righ|teous. Hence he wou'd not go in <HI>direct</HI> contradiction to his duty in order to obtain Balak's reward, but &s;et him&s;elf to reconcile his duty with his views of worldly gain and preferment. After God had plainly told him once, that he &s;hould not cur&s;e I&s;rael, it was enough&mdash;he &s;hou'd have enquired no further, Yet after this he held
<PB N="16" REF="012746_0013_0F8BED92B921BB80">
one con&s;ultation and another with Balak's me&s;&s;engers, and enquires of God again and again concerning the matter whereof he had already been fully certified. Not &s;ucceed|ing according to his mind, though he per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;o|lution not to cur&s;e I&s;rael without an explicit divine per|mi&s;&s;ion, yet he proceeded to <HI>coun&s;el Balak to lay a &s;tumbling block before</HI> them, which prov'd their de&s;truction. In this way he pacified his con&s;cience, while he as effectually broke over the divine in&s;tructions as if he had cur&s;ed I&s;rael in the name of God. In many (perhaps mo&s;t) ca&s;es men's duty is plain at the fir&s;t propo&s;al. It is difficult to mi&s;take it. In &s;uch ca&s;es, deliberation is but a &s;ubterfuge to break o|ver the obligation of it. Hence it is that men affect to doubt in the plaine&s;t matters, i. e. the mo&s;t important. By indirect means, they evade the &s;en&s;e of moral and reli|gious obligation, and keep all quiet within, while they do tho&s;e things in <HI>effect,</HI> which they wou'd &s;tart back at the thought of doing in a <HI>direct</HI> manner. Had they made their choice and acted according to the fir&s;t appearance of things, they wou'd have cho&s;en the good and right way: But &s;ome favourite hypothe&s;is mu&s;t be maintain'd, &s;ome lu&s;t or pa&s;&s;ion gratified, at all events; and hence it is that they labour to reconcile things contrary, as light and dark|ne&s;s, righteou&s;ne&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. 'Tis hard to give up the hopes of religion, but harder to &s;acrifice their worldly views.</P>
<P>Some (and the&s;e men of fine parts) have gone further, and pro&s;tituted their &s;uperior talents in embelli&s;hing vice, and attempting to take off from it it's ju&s;t odium; em|ploying their powers in the cau&s;e of infidelity, &s;aping the foundation of every religious principle, and con&s;equently of all virtue. As though the gift of rea&s;on were be&s;tow|ed on us to &s;ub&s;erve the gratification of the appetites and pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;that we might make our&s;elves more vile than the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h&mdash;might &s;in with more <HI>delicacy</HI> and <HI>malignity</HI> indeed, but with no remor&s;e.

<P>That attention and examination, which, as moral agents,

we are capable of, and is our bounden duty, is of &s;uch evident importance that to the neglect of it are attribut|ed in &s;cripture mo&s;t of the &s;ins and mi&s;eries of men. <HI>My people will not con&s;ider.

The animal creatures act as impelled by in&s;tinct and ap|petite. They have not a power of deliberating, rea&s;on|ing, reflecting&mdash;they wait only for an opportunity of acti|on, without being able to con&s;ider the con&s;equences.

None of the wicked &s;hall under&s;tand, but the wi&s;e &s;hall under&s;tand.</P>
<P>On the contrary, tho&s;e who &s;u&s;pend and deliberate from the latter view mentioned above, ju&s;tly expo&s;e them|&s;elves to be given over to &s;trong delu&s;ions; their fooli&s;h heart becomes darkned, and hardened through the deceit|fulne&s;s of &s;in. They become an ea&s;y prey to the god of this world, who is permitted to blind their eyes, &s;o that the arguments and motives of rea&s;on and religion have little or no weight with them.</P>
<P>Much the &s;ame may be &s;aid of tho&s;e, who&s;e lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions <HI>precipitate</HI> their moral judgment, as of the more deliberate workers of wickedne&s;s who take much pains to darken and bribe it. They alike expo&s;e them&s;elves to be delivered over to the will and power of the deceiver of the nations, the enemy of all righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>But it is objected, that &s;u&s;pending implies, the mind hath already made its choice; that is, it hath cho&s;en to deliberate and examine&mdash;that the difficulty, therefore, &s;till returns, and the cau&s;e of this determination to &s;u&s;pend re|mains to be pointed out.</P>
<P>To this we an&s;wer, that a moral agent either hath pow|er to <HI>originate</HI> an act of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, and &s;o bring him&s;elf into the view of new motives; or the &s;u&s;pending act pro|ceeds from a motive extant in his mind at the &s;ame in|&s;tant with &s;ome motive to immediate election or action. The former will not be allowed, as it would be at once to admit &s;elf-determination. And on the latter &s;uppo&s;iti|on, the motive to &s;u&s;pend, mu&s;t be <HI>previous</HI> to the act of

&s;u&s;pen&s;ion, el&s;e it cannot be the cau&s;e of that act&mdash;cannot move or excite to it. There mu&s;t be the exertion of the cau&s;e before the effect can take place. But if the mo|tive to &s;u&s;pend be previous to the act of &s;upen&s;ion, then the other motive to immediate election and action mu&s;t determine the will <HI>till</HI> the motive to &s;u&s;pend has produc|ed its effect: That is, the agent is determined, his choice is made, before he determines to &s;u&s;pend; the act of &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion is an after act. In other words, there is, proper|ly &s;peaking, no &s;u&s;pen&s;ion at all. Or viewing the mat|ter in the mo&s;t favourable light, it will &s;tand thus: A moral agent cannot be the &s;ource of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion in him&s;elf. No motive <HI>ab extra</HI> to &s;u&s;pend being extant in his mind, he mu&s;t immediately make his choice. To &s;ay he had a power of awakening in him&s;elf a motive to &s;u&s;pend, or of negativing a pre&s;ent motive to action, would be to a&s;|&s;ert &s;elf-determination; or to &s;ay, that the act of &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion had already taken place, which, by &s;uppo&s;ition, can be only in con&s;equence of &s;ome previous motive. There was, then, a temptation exhibited to the mind of Lucifer, while a &s;on of the morning, to ri&s;e up in rebellion again&s;t the Mo&s;t High. It had po&s;itive influence to excite and move him to this thing. He had no intrin&s;ic power to negative it, or to &s;u&s;pend election, or view the temptation in any other light than he in fact did. It nece&s;&s;arily de|termined him. Upon his revolt, he was an in&s;trument in &s;ugge&s;ting a &s;imilar temptation to our progenitors in pa|radi&s;e&mdash;which they could view no otherwi&s;e than they did&mdash; their choice was determined in the &s;ame way. Thus &s;in and mi&s;ery came into the world. Here is the true &s;ource of all the wickedne&s;s of men and devils. Can it be de|fended on the maxims of rea&s;on, experience or religion? Is it not wholly forgotten, that moral agents have the faculty of <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> the power of <HI>reflection?</HI> Let this &s;ingle que&s;tion be decided, Whether vicious beings derive <HI>the &s;tate of their wills</HI> from the author of their frame? and the whole di&s;pute will be determined accordingly.

<P>There can, &s;trictly &s;peaking, be no motive to the choice and determination of a <HI>rational</HI> creature, but &s;uch as com|ports with the dignity of his nature, con&s;cience being al|ways con&s;idered as &s;upreme. Hence motives of intere&s;t, honor, plea&s;ure, are motives to pur&s;ue what is, <HI>upon the whole,</HI> beneficial, honorable, plea&s;urable&mdash;not what may <HI>ca&s;ually</HI> gratify the lower affections and appetites, in op|po&s;ition to rea&s;on, to the true intere&s;t, dignity and enjoy|ment of a moral and accountable creature. To &s;ay, that &s;uch a creature, in ca&s;e of a competition of objects, cannot &s;top and con&s;ider <HI>which</HI> rea&s;on directs to, and govern him|&s;elf accordingly, is either to deny him the power of reflec|tion, or to &s;uppo&s;e him given over to a reprobate mind. When the animal propen&s;ities and the dictates of rea&s;on are at variance, (as they often are) may not the former be negatived? And is it not &s;omewhat of a &s;oleci&s;m to &s;ay, a rational creature can have a motive to act unrea&s;onably? In a loo&s;e way of &s;peaking, we are indeed wont to &s;ay, that the covetous, ambitious and voluptuous have motives to the pur&s;uit of unju&s;t gain, unlawful plea&s;ure, and to make their way to preferment by di&s;honorable means. But it may be worthy of con&s;ideration, whether, in &s;trict propriety, a motive to &s;uch a choice and pur&s;uit, as con|tradicts the leading and di&s;tingui&s;hing principle of our na|ture, really de&s;erves to be called a motive to &s;uch a being as man? Be this as it will, we evidently have a power of deliberating, reflecting, or &s;u&s;pending&mdash;of con&s;idering what is before us&mdash;Moral agents <Q>have a capacity of being in|fluenced in their actions by moral inducements and mo|tives, exhibited to the view of <HI>under&s;tanding and rea&s;on, to engage to a conduct agreable to the moral faculty.</HI></Q> This capacity in moral agents, admitted and maintain'd by Mr. Edwards, is a demon&s;trable proof of &s;elf-determination, as it implies the power of &s;u&s;pending, which we have been arguing for. A power of &s;u&s;pending election and action is plainly a power of determining whether we will be go|verned by rea&s;on and the principles of religion, or not.

And can this power be allowed to moral agents con&s;i&s;|tently with the denial of &s;elf-determination? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A learned and very worthy friend, on peru&s;ing what we had wrote on the article of &s;u&s;pending pre&s;ent volition, deliberating, &amp;c. was plea&s;ed to &s;ugge&s;t, that <Q>as it mu&s;t depend on the moral agent <HI>him|&s;elf,</HI> whether he will &s;u&s;pend, con&s;ider, &amp;c. and con&s;equently is a full proof, or rather the actual exerci&s;e, of &s;elf-determination; &s;o <HI>this may be the foundation of an entire difference between God and the creature.</HI> There is no room for con&s;ideration, or any act or ex|erci&s;e &s;imilar to it in God, becau&s;e of his omni&s;cience.

<P>While the agency of the animal creatures is as nece&s;&s;ary as the rotation of the earth and revolutions of the planets, the cau&s;e of <HI>moral</HI> volitions is in the mind it&s;elf which is the &s;ubject of them, as will appear, we apprehend, from a little attention to the moral faculty of under&s;tanding. This regulating power of moral agents ideots and madmen have not, and therefore are not moral agents any more than brutes. And though, as was &s;aid before, the motions of inanimate bodies or of animals are not &s;imilar to moral agency; yet were the dictate of the moral faculty follow|ed without deviation, mankind would as regularly fill up their place in the creation, as the lower animals do theirs &mdash;as regularly as the &s;ea&s;ons revolve, or the heavenly bo|dies move. There would be as great harmony in moral nature as appears in the other works of God.</P>
<P>Superior intelligences, in other worlds, we may &s;uppo&s;e, are as regular to the duties of their &s;tation, and fulfil the plea&s;ure of the Creator with a like punctuality and con|&s;tancy, as the luminaries of heaven &s;hine. That men on earth do not, in their mea&s;ure, fulfil his will as it is done by higher orders of beings in heaven, is their &s;in; as they have the &s;ame general faculty to direct and govern 'em, how much &s;oever the inhabitants of the world above may <HI>excel in</HI> intellectual <HI>&s;trength.</HI> Were there not a proper cau&s;e in the mind, the exerci&s;es and actions of mankind wou'd uniformly be &s;uch as the order of our nature points out.

in no other light than any alteration in the material world, or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the laws of nature. The latter might as well be judged criminal and morally evil as the former. If the cau&s;e of the exerci&s;es and actions of moral agents be not in them&s;elves, then the Deity is the proper efficient cau&s;e of them.

The &s;uppo&s;ition of the divine agency in &s;in, moreover, confounds the di&s;tinction between the agency or influence of God, and that of the devil.

His dependance on divine influence for the pre&s;ervation of his moral rectitude, as well as of his exi&s;tence, proveth nothing to the contrary, if it be true, that <HI>that</HI> influence wou'd not have been withheld, had not man, by &s;ome act of rebellion, incur'd the forfeiture of it.

And what|ever impotency is derived to us from the human apo&s;tacy, 'tis &s;ufficient that in regeneration &s;uch power is re&s;tor'd as is equal to the purpo&s;es of &s;alvation&mdash;that as men have re|ceived grace, &s;o God is ever ready to &s;upport them in duty, while they acknowledge their dependance, and draw nigh to him. <HI>For every one that a&s;keth, receiveth; and he that &s;eeketh, findeth.</HI></P>
<P>The things that have been offered are &s;ufficient to prove, that moral volitions proceed from a cau&s;e in moral agents them&s;elves, and to explain in what &s;en&s;e we main|tain this. They &s;erve further to illu&s;trate and e&s;tabli&s;h our doctrine of human liberty. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Further to illu&s;trate and confirm the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent en|quiry, we beg leave to make &s;ome quotations from a writer of great merit.</P>
<P>"The true rea&s;on why a per&s;on cannot complain of being made an&s;werable for an action, is, that he has <HI>produced</HI> it him&s;elf knowingly and willingly&mdash;is the real <HI>author,</HI> the <HI>productive cau&s;e,</HI> of his actions&mdash; the good or bad effects from thence ari&s;ing may be ju&s;tly attributed and referred to him, as to the <HI>efficient cau&s;e</HI>&mdash;the <HI>author or moral cau&s;e.</HI> Every thing almo&s;t that is &s;aid and done in human &s;ociety &s;uppo&s;es this principle generally received, and every body acquie&s;ceth in it from an inward conviction&mdash;Every action or omi&s;&s;ion &s;ubject to the direction of man, can be charged to the account of the per&s;on in who&s;e power it was to do it or let it alone: and on the contrary, every action, who&s;e exi&s;tence or non exi&s;tence does not depend on our will, cannot be imputed to us. Ob&s;erve here, that omi&s;&s;ions are ranked by civili|ans and morali&s;ts among the number of actions; becau&s;e they appre|hend them as the effect of a voluntary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the exerci&s;e of our faculties.&mdash;</P>
<P>We may impute to a per&s;on every action or omi&s;&s;ion, of which he is the <HI>author</HI> or <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> and which he could or ought to have done or o|mitted.&mdash;</P>
<P>With regard to another per&s;on's actions, they cannot be imputed to us, but in as much as we have concurred to them, and as we could and ought to have procured, hindered, or at lea&s;t directed them after a certain manner. The thing &s;peaks for it&s;elf. For to impute ano|ther man's actions to a per&s;on, is declaring that the latter is the <HI>effici|ent,</HI> though not the only cau&s;e thereof; and con&s;equently that this action depended in &s;ome mea&s;ure on his will, either in its principle or execution&mdash;</P>
<P>It is not &s;ufficient to have enlightened the mind in re&s;pect to the nature of tho&s;e goods and evils that are capable of rendering us really happy or unhappy; we &s;hould likewi&s;e give <HI>activity</HI> and <HI>efficacy</HI> to the&s;e principles, by forming the will &s;o as to determine it&s;elf by ta&s;te and habit, pur&s;uant to the coun&s;els of enlightened rea&s;on. And let no one think it impo&s;&s;ible to change our inclinations, or to reform our ta&s;tes. It is with the ta&s;te of the mind, as with that of the palate. Experience &s;hews, that we may alter both, &s;o as to find plea&s;ure at length in things that before were di&s;agreable to us. We begin to do a thing with pain, and by an effort of rea&s;on; afterwards we fami|liari&s;e our&s;elves to it by degrees; then a frequency of acts renders it ea&s;ier to us, the repugnance cea&s;eth, we view the thing in a different light from what we did before; and u&s;e at length makes us love a thing that before was the object of our aver&s;ion.&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;Our mind inclines naturally to that &s;ide which &s;eems the mo&s;t probable; but this does not debar it from &s;u&s;pending its a&s;&s;ent, in order to &s;eek for new proofs, or to refer the whole enquiry to a future opportunity.&mdash;</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to things that are evident. It is always in our power to apply our minds to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e things, or el&s;e to divert them from thence, by transfering &s;omewhere el&s;e our attention. This fir&s;t determination of the will, by which it is led to con&s;ider or not to con&s;ider the objects that occur to us, merits particular notice, becau&s;e of the natural influence it mu&s;t have on the very determination, by which we conclude to act or not to act, in con&s;equence of our reflexion and judgment. Secondly, we have it likewi&s;e in our power to <HI>create,</HI> as it were, evidence in &s;ome ca&s;es, by dint of attention and enquiry; whereas at fir&s;t &s;etting out, we had only &s;ome glimmerings, in&s;ufficient to give us an adequate knowledge of the &s;tate of things. In fine, when we have attained this evidence, we are &s;till at liberty to dwell more or le&s;s on the con&s;ideration thereof; which is al&s;o of great con|&s;equence, becau&s;e on this depends its greater or le&s;&s;er degree of im|pre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;</P>
<P>To prove that man is indeed a free agent&mdash;let us therefore con&s;ult only our&s;elves. Every one finds that he is ma&s;ter, for in&s;tance, to walk or &s;it; to &s;peak or hold his tongue. Do not we al&s;o experience continually, that it depends entirely on our&s;elves to &s;u&s;pend our judgment, in order to proceed to a new enquiry? Can any one &s;eri|ou&s;ly deny, that in the choice of good and evil our re&s;olutions are uncon&s;trained; that, notwith&s;tanding the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, we have it in our power to &s;top of a &s;udden, to weigh the arguments on both &s;ides, and to do, in &s;hort, whatever can be expected from the free&s;t a|gent.&mdash;I find I can ab&s;tain from any particular good; I can defer u&s;ing it; I can prefer &s;omething el&s;e to it; I can he&s;itate in my choice, in &s;hort, I am my own ma&s;ter to chu&s;e, or, which is the &s;ame thing, I am <HI>free</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible proofs like the&s;e are &s;uperior to all objection, and produc|tive of the mo&s;t inward conviction, by rea&s;on it is impo&s;&s;ible, that when the &s;oul is modified after a certain manner, it &s;hould not feel this modification, and the &s;tate which con&s;equently attends it. What other certainty have we of our exi&s;tance? And how is it we know that we think, we act, but by our inward &s;en&s;e?</P>
<P>This &s;en&s;e of liberty is &s;o much the le&s;s equivocal, as it is not mo|mentary or tran&s;ient: It is a &s;en&s;e that never leaves us, and of which we have a daily and continual experience&mdash;Reflections, deliberations, re&s;earches, actions, judgments; all &s;uppo&s;e the u&s;e of liberty. Hence the ideas of good and evil, of vice and virtue: hence, as a natural con&s;equence, ari&s;es prai&s;e or blame, the cen&s;ure or approbation of our own, or other people's conduct. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the affec|tions and natural &s;entiments of men towards one another, as friend|&s;hip, benevolence, gratitude, hatred, anger, complaints and reproach|es: None of the&s;e &s;entiments could take place unle&s;s we were to admit of liberty. In fine, as this prerogative is in &s;ome mea&s;ure the key of the human &s;y&s;tem, he that does not allow it to man, &s;ubverts all order, and introduceth a general confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is natural here to enquire, how it was ever po&s;&s;ible for any body &s;eriou&s;ly to doubt, whether man is ma&s;ter of his own actions, whether he is free? I &s;hould be le&s;s &s;urprized at this doubt, were it concerning a &s;trange or remote fact, a fact that was not tran&s;acted within our&s;elves. But the que&s;tion is in regard to a thing, of which we have an internal immediate feeling, a con&s;tant and daily experience. Strange, that any one &s;hould call in que&s;tion a faculty of the &s;oul! May not we as well doubt of the under&s;tanding and will, as of the liberty of man? For if we are content to abide by our inward &s;en&s;e, there is no more room to di&s;pute of one than of the other. But &s;ome too &s;ubtile phi|lo&s;ophers, by con&s;idering this &s;ubject in a <HI>metaphy&s;ical</HI> light, have &s;tript it, as it were of its nature; and finding them&s;elves at a lo&s;s to &s;olve a few difficulties, they have given a greater attention to the&s;e difficul|ties than to the po&s;itive proofs of the thing; which in&s;en&s;ibly led them to imagine that the notion of liberty was all an illu&s;ion.&mdash;We are in|formed by experience, that in &s;everal things which, in re&s;pect to us are in re&s;ted with the highe&s;t degree of certainty, there are many dif|ficulties notwith&s;tanding, which we are incapable of re&s;olving to our &s;atisfaction: And this is a natural con&s;equence of the limits of the mind. Let us conclude therefore from hence, that when a truth is &s;ufficiently evinced by &s;olid rea&s;ons, whatever can be objected again&s;t it, ought not to &s;tagger or weaken our conviction, as long as they are &s;uch difficulties only as embarra&s;s or puzzle the mind, without inva|lidating the proofs them&s;elves.</P>

If he is able, and there is nothing in the way to hinder his <HI>pur&s;uing</HI> and <HI>executing</HI> his will, the man is fully and perfectly free.</Q> Whence it is manife&s;t, that Mr. Ed|wards had no other notion of liberty than what re&s;pects external action or conduct. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e who de&s;ire particular &s;atisfaction that Mr. Edwards held no other liberty may examine p. 38, 39, 40; 76, 77; 132; 189; 191; 213; 214, 215; 234; 236; 259.&mdash;&amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> The plea&s;ure of the mind, and acting or conducting according to it, are entirely dif|ferent. The <HI>act of volition</HI> or <HI>choice</HI> is a different thing from the <HI>pur&s;uit</HI> or <HI>execution</HI> of what is willed or cho&s;en. And if liberty con&s;i&s;ts in the latter only, it cannot be at all re|qui&s;ite to moral agency and accountablene&s;s. There may be a willing or an unwilling mind when there is not "pow|er, opportunity or advantage for one to do as he plea&s;|eth." And moral agents, it is conceded, may be worthy of prai&s;e or blame in ca&s;es where they <HI>cannot</HI> execute their wills, by rea&s;on of external <HI>impediment or re&s;traint</HI>&mdash;and in ca&s;es where they are <HI>compelled</HI> to act contrary to their wills. And where natural nece&s;&s;ity doth not take place, it is con|ceded, that virtue or vice con&s;i&s;ts not in the external doing or forbearing, but in the &s;tate and di&s;po&s;ition of the mind or will. Now as, on Mr. Edwards's principles, the whole of liberty con&s;i&s;ts in a "power or opportunity to do as one plea&s;eth&mdash;to <HI>pur&s;ue and execute</HI> his will;" it clearly follows, that liberty, according to his definition of it, is not e&s;&s;ential to virtue or vice, prai&s;e or blame, Yet he affirms it is nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential hereto.</P>
<P>Mr. Edwards's rea&s;oning on this point, reduced to pro|per form, will &s;tand thus: Liberty is e&s;&s;ential to prai&s;e or blame. Liberty con&s;i&s;ts in a man's pur&s;uing and exe|cuting his will. Ergo, If he he cannot execute his will,
<PB N="29" REF="012746_0026_0F8BED9DFB5DD0A0">
he cannot be worthy of prai&s;e or blame. Would Mr. Ed|wards abide by this con&s;equence? If not, let any one re&s;|cue his doctrine from it.</P>
<P>In truth, whether moral agents &s;hall execute their wills depends not on them&s;elves. Their natural liberty may be abridged of taken away, and yet their freedom as ac|countable creatures remain. If then liberty be really ne|ce&s;&s;ary to prai&s;e of blame, it mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in a power either to chu&s;e or refu&s;e that wherein virtue and vice con&s;i&s;t. And con&s;equently the will it&s;elf, its &s;tate, volitions or acts, mu&s;t be determined by moral agents them&s;elves&mdash;at lea&s;t in &s;ome in&s;tances, and within a certain mea&s;ure. There is no occa&s;ion to add any thing further to what we before wrote on this point, Examination part I. &s;ect. 3. and part III. &s;ect. 1.</P>
<P>But admitting Mr. Edwards maintained <HI>internal</HI> free|dom: We a&s;k, of what &s;ort? <HI>moral</HI> freedom, or only <HI>ani|mal?</HI> The latter may be called <HI>natural</HI> liberty, as well as the freedom of the executive powers be &s;o denominated. But it is not e&s;&s;ential to prai&s;e or blame. Ideots, lunatics and brutes have this liberty, but are not therefore moral agents. Virtue or vice, reward or puni&s;hment depend not on the having this liberty. Yet Mr. Edwards admits no other. If he means any thing by the <HI>freedom of the &s;oul as a moral agent,</HI> it is this, that moral agents are &s;o framed, have &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions con-created with them, or infufed into them by the author of their beings, that they exerci&s;e freely what is created with or infu&s;ed into them, and can do no otherwi&s;e. The &s;tate and bias of the mind, the par|ticular bent of their wills, by which all their pur&s;uits are determined, is fixed by nece&s;&s;ity. As &s;uppo&s;e one hath a propen&s;ity to intemperance; another to uncleanne&s;s, a third to theft, a fourth to covetou&s;ne&s;s and extortion, a fifth to pride, malice or revenge, &amp;c. in exerci&s;ing, pur&s;uing or executing the&s;e different pa&s;&s;ions they are re&s;pectively free, they act as they plea&s;e, or according to their will; but have no hand in the <HI>formation</HI> of the&s;e various propen&s;ities. <Q>Let them come by their</Q> &s;everal inclinations and propen|&s;ities <Q><HI>how they will,</HI> yet if they are able, and there is no|thing in the way to hinder their <HI>pur&s;uing</HI> and <HI>executing</HI>

<HEAD>SECTION II. On the influence of motives in moral vo|litions.</HEAD>
<P>THE near relation this part of our &s;ubject hath to the preceeding naturally leads us to &s;uch ob&s;ervations as may be explanatory of the things already offered, and &s;trengthen their evidence: While what hath been &s;aid may an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e with re&s;pect to what we &s;hall now offer on the relation motives have to the voliti|ons of moral agents.</P>
<P>The whole di&s;pute turns on the deci&s;ion of this que&s;tion, Whether moral agents have a principle of <HI>efficiency</HI> in them|&s;elves? In what follows, we &s;hall endeavor further to &s;up|port the affirmative.</P>
<P>By motives we mean external rea&s;ons or inducements exhibited to the view of a moral agent. Mr. Edwards, in a more general way, intends (as we &s;uppo&s;e) an extrin&s;ic moral cau&s;e, by the term motive. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are very &s;en&s;ible he had no <HI>fixed</HI> meaning to this word in his writings. We took notice of his vague and arbitrary u&s;e and appli|cation of it, Examination &s;ect. 2. part I &mdash;particularly p. 26. marg. In the &s;en&s;e he &s;ometimes u&s;eth the word [motive] it is not <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> to the mind, nor even <HI>antecedent</HI> to volition, nor <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> from it&mdash;con&s;e|quently, hath not a <HI>tendency</HI> to excite volition, is not the <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> nor &s;o much as the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of it. To &s;peak of the <HI>preponderation and preva|lency</HI> of motive implies that the mind is already determined; that its choice is made. And hence a preponderating, prevalent motive is not the determiner of the mind's election. The cau&s;e of this is &s;till to be &s;ought &s;omewhere el&s;e. One while Mr. Edwards blends motive and volition&mdash;at another time he makes the former the moral cau&s;e of the latter&mdash;then again intimates that motive is not a proper <HI>efficient,</HI> but only an <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of volition&mdash;then turns about and blends percep|tion and action.</NOTE></P>
<P>He affirms motives to be moral cau&s;es, by way of di&s;|tinction
<PB N="32" REF="012746_0029_0F8BEDA0398F90B0">
from natural cau&s;es; and, according to his rea|&s;oning, they produce their effects in the &s;ame way&mdash;that is, through the divine energy. Moral effects nece&s;&s;arily fol|low the <HI>efficiency</HI> of their cau&s;e&mdash;moral cau&s;es are as <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> as natural. (P. 103; 261, &amp;c.)</P>
<P>It might be abundantly &s;hewn that Mr. Edwards a&s;|cribes efficiency to motives, from his whole book; and more e&s;pecially from Part II. Sect. 10. But we &s;hall only quote the following from p. 134, 135. in confirmation hereof. <Q>If motives excite volition, then they are the CAUSE of it's being excited&mdash;To excite, is po&s;itively to <HI>do</HI> &s;omething; and certainly that which does &s;omething, is the CAUSE of the thing <HI>done</HI> by it. To create, is to cau&s;e to be created; to make, is to cau&s;e to be made&mdash; to quicken, is to cau&s;e to be quickened; and <HI>to excite,</HI> is <HI>to cau&s;e to be excited.</HI> To excite, is to be a cau&s;e in the mo&s;t <HI>proper</HI> &s;en&s;e, not meerly a negative occa&s;ion, but a ground of exi&s;tence by po&s;itive influence. The notion of <HI>exciting,</HI> is exerting influence to cau&s;e the effect to ari&s;e or come forth into exi&s;tence&mdash;The <HI>production</HI> of an effect is certainly the <HI>cau&s;ing</HI> of an effect; and <HI>produc|tive influence</HI> is <HI>cau&s;al influence,</HI> if any thing is; and that which has this influence prevalently, &s;o as thereby to become the ground of another thing, is a cau&s;e of that thing, <HI>if there be any &s;uch thing as a cau&s;e.</HI></Q> Tho&s;e who are &s;till di&s;po&s;ed to que&s;tion whether Mr. Edwards a&s;cribes cau&s;ality or efficiency to motives may call to mind the &s;tory he tells of the animal in <HI>Terra del Fuego.</HI> (p. 282.)</P>
<P>However, we &s;ee not what advantage can accrue to Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme, or what injury to our own, &s;hould it be granted, that upon his plan motives are not, in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e, the cau&s;e of moral volitions. For if &s;o, what was he about when he wrote his book? Was it not his decla|red de&s;ign to point out the cau&s;e of volition? Doth he not labour abundantly to prove, that this cau&s;e mu&s;t ever|more be that motive, which, in the view of the agent, is highe&s;t? If by this moral cau&s;e, as he &s;peaks, nothing more be meant than the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of volition, not the cau&s;e in a &s;trict and proper &s;en&s;e, how has he then an&s;wered the que&s;tion propo&s;ed, viz. "What determines the will? To
<PB N="33" REF="012746_0030_0F8BEDA0F77EF860">
&s;ay that motive is the occa&s;ion of the will's determination; is nothing to the purpo&s;e. We want to be directed to the <HI>efficient.</HI> This enquiry is of no le&s;s importance than it is to know the proper cau&s;e of every moral event. It Mr. Edwards did not &s;uppo&s;e motives to be efficient cau&s;es, volition can have no &s;uch cau&s;e at all on his &s;cheme.&mdash;In other words, there could be no &s;uch effect as a moral vo|lition. For a moral effect cannot exi&s;t without a cau&s;e any more than a natural effect: And Mr. Edwards denieth that the &s;ubject of &s;uch volition, can be the efficient or producer of it, So that to deny motives efficiency to pro|duce volition, is, upon his principles, to &s;ay, that all moral events are without a cau&s;e&mdash;rather, that there are no &s;uch events exi&s;ting.</P>
<P>Should it be &s;aid, that creatures to whom moral agency belongs are the proper efficients of their own volitions, this would be directly to admit our doctrine&mdash;to a&s;&s;ert a &s;elf-determining power, and make this the foundation of prai&s;e and blame, rewards and puni&s;hments. Should it be &s;aid that the fir&s;t cau&s;e is the proper efficient of every mo|ral volition, this would rather increa&s;e than relieve the dif|ficulty. For it equally militates with Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme to &s;uppo&s;e a &s;elf-determining power in the creator, as in the creature. And then to a&s;cribe the &s;inful voliti|ons of creatures to divine efficiency, is to affirm that God is the proper cau&s;e and author of wickedne&s;s. In every view Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme is &s;trangely embarra&s;&s;ed. It is conceded, that every moral volition hath an efficient cau&s;e. And is it a trivial point whether this cau&s;e be &s;up|po&s;ed to be in the &s;ubject of &s;uch volition, or extrin&s;ic to him?</P>
<P>As, on Mr. Edwards's principles, the efficient cau&s;e of the moral volitions of creatures mu&s;t be either extrin&s;ic motive, or God him&s;elf through the intervention of motive, each of the&s;e ca&s;es &s;hall be di&s;tinctly examined: And if neither of them can be maintained, the other opinion mu&s;t be the truth, that moral agents are the cau&s;e of their own volitions.</P>
<P>Now it cannot be that motives are them&s;elves efficient cau&s;es. For an efficient mu&s;t needs be an agent. A mo|ral

efficient mu&s;t be a mu&s;t agent. <Q>Ab&s;tract notions (as all rea&s;ons and motives are</Q>) are not agents. Or &s;hould it be &s;aid that moral agency belongs to them, it would no way &s;erve Mr. Edward's cau&s;e. For if motives are agents, then they are them&s;elves determined by motive. To be an efficient is to act, and action implies agency. If motives are not agents, then either the &s;ubject of a moral volition is al&s;o the moral cau&s;e of it, or &s;ome other agent is that cau&s;e. To &s;ay &s;ome other agent is the cau&s;e, is ei|ther to a&s;cribe &s;elf-determination to this &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;e, or to run back the efficient of volition <HI>in infinitum.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Edwards him&s;elf &s;aith, that the act of volition is determined <HI>always</HI> by that in the mind's view of an object, which <HI>cau&s;eth it to appear</HI> mo&s;t agreable, not by the agre|able appearance <HI>it&s;elf;</HI> for this, in his opinion, is nothing <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> from volition (P. 11, 12.)

<P>If motives are not them&s;elves efficients, let us next en|quire, whether God is the efficient cau&s;e of all moral voli|tions in the creatures through the medium of motives. Now in a moral e&s;timation, it makes no difference, whe|ther the Deity be the <HI>immediate</HI> or <HI>mediate</HI> cau&s;e of &s;in and moral turpitude. To &s;ay he is the efficient in either &s;en&s;e is equally and infinitely reproachful to him.

and di&s;po&s;ed by the governor of the world, is ultimately to a&s;cribe all moral evil to his efficiency. But how con|&s;i&s;tently with his moral character? For can it be that the efficient cau&s;e of wickedne&s;s is not wicked?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a parent, who had given it in charge to a child, be &s;ure to &s;hun this and the other vice, &s;hould yet lay be|fore &s;uch child the &s;tronge&s;t temptations to the vices cau|tion'd again&s;t, would not the child naturally conclude that the parents admonitions are only words of cour&s;e? that he &s;hou'd not affront, but plea&s;e his parent, by li&s;tning to the enticements of his own propo&s;ing? Would not all men lay the blame to the parent for &s;eting invincible temp|tations before a child? Now the &s;uppo&s;ition that the pa|rent of the world exhibits to the minds of his rational offspring, in an irre&s;i&s;tible manner, motives to vice, is re|ally more reproachful, &s;ince (by &s;uppo&s;ition) 'tis through his operation and efficiency with them that vice is produ|ced, as the nece&s;&s;ary effect. Doth the father of angels and men (who compared with him are children in under&s;tand|ing) &s;educe them in this manner, taking advantage of their ignorance and weakne&s;s, and exert his own influence for their ruin? When Mr. Edwards &s;ays, <Q>God is the &s;ource of all moral ability and agency,</Q> (p. 42.) doth he mean that he is the &s;ource of all moral evil? There is a &s;en&s;e in which this ob&s;ervation is doubtle&s;s true. But if a di|vine efficiency in &s;inful volitions was meant to be com|preheded under it, this is greatly to err.</P>
<P>But if motives are not efficient cau&s;es, nor the Deity through the intervention of them, then moral agents them&s;elves are. If the cau&s;e of volition be not extrin&s;ic, it mu&s;t be intrin&s;ic, in the agent him&s;elf; which is to &s;ay, in other words, that moral agents are &s;elf-determined.</P>
<P>By affirming this we mean not, however, to deny the influence of motives in moral volitions. We may admit the operation of motives on moral agents without attribut|ing cau&s;ality to motives. They are rea&s;ons exhibited to us to determine our&s;elves by; but are not moral cau&s;es, as hath been &s;hewn from the nature of them, and from Mr. Edwards's own doctrine on the article of motives.</P>
<P>Still it may be &s;aid, If moral agents <HI>invariably</HI> determine

them&s;elves according to the greate&s;t apparent good, this effectually e&s;tabli&s;heth the doctrine of moral nece&s;&s;ity; and, con&s;equently, proves that the highe&s;t motive <HI>nece&s;&s;i|tates</HI> volition, if it be not, &s;trictly &s;peaking, the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of it.</P>
<P>This matter requires a careful examination. For with|out determing at pre&s;ent, whether a principle of cau&s;ation in the mind or agent, in di&s;tinction from motive, is or is not reconcileable with moral nece&s;&s;ity; the admi&s;&s;ion of this would, doubtle&s;s, much weaken the evidence of the point we contend for. It mu&s;t be allowed, that if the volitions of moral agents <HI>always</HI> are <HI>as the greate&s;t apparent good is,</HI> this amounts to a proof of nece&s;&s;ity in the <HI>philo&s;o|phic</HI> &s;en&s;e of the word.

<P>We have not pretended to &s;tate the <HI>degree</HI> of moral li|berty, or <HI>&s;phere</HI> of its exerci&s;e by moral agents. All that we have argued for is this, that accountable creatures either have, or at lea&s;t originally had, a freedom to chu&s;e <HI>differently</HI> from what they do. This is no more than the generality of reformed divines have maintained. A liber|ty of <HI>indifference</HI> we have no where a&s;&s;erted. For though we agree with Dr. Watts and &s;ome other writers, who u&s;e this term, in the thing they intend by it; yet as we do not entirely approve the manner of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;o we have ne|ver once u&s;ed this term to expre&s;s our &s;en&s;e of liberty.</P>
<P>Mr. Edwards repre&s;ents tho&s;e writers who argue for a liberty of indifference, particularly Dr. Watts, as meaning hereby two contrary things, neither of which was their &s;entiment. He more generally would have it, that they mean <HI>perfect</HI> indifference, or <HI>equilibrium.</HI> But he has al&s;o intimated by his own u&s;e of the word, (p. 9.) that his op|ponents mean, by indifference, &s;omething neither <HI>agreable</HI> nor <HI>di&s;agreable,</HI> eligible or the contrary. The&s;e are two notions of indifference, altogether diver&s;e, and even contrary. (One thing may be far from being <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> indifferent, while another is preferable.) However, nei|ther of the&s;e was the notion of indifference maintain'd by the authors Mr. Edwards oppo&s;eth. The &s;en&s;e in which they a&s;&s;ert liberty of indifference is preci&s;ely this&mdash;a free+dom in moral agents to chu&s;e <HI>otherwi&s;e</HI> than they do&mdash; what was called in the &s;chools, <HI>Libertas indifferentiae ad op|po&s;ita,</HI> <Q>a liberty of indifference to chu&s;e one thing, or its oppo&s;ite.</Q> Such a &s;en&s;e of liberty is &s;o far from being the peculiar notion of <Q><HI>Pelagians, Semi-Pelagians, Je&s;uits, Socinians, Arminians,</HI> and others</Q> of the &s;ame &s;tamp, as Mr. Edwards injuriou&s;ly repre&s;ents, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 89.</NOTE> that it has been maintained by the mo&s;t eminent divines called <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> as we &s;hall be ready to &s;hew &s;hould there be occa&s;ion.

For <Q>whatever is a motive mu&s;t be &s;omething <HI>extant in the view of the per|ceiving faculty.</HI></Q> (P. 8.) Yet Mr. Edwards admits, that two or more given things may appear <Q><HI>exactly alike, one as good as another</HI>&mdash;as &s;up|po&s;e two eggs, or two cakes</Q>&mdash;there is no preference, at lea&s;t none perceived by the mind, as he allows, in the&s;e ca&s;es. Is then the will determined by, or <HI>as</HI> the greate&s;t apparent good in &s;uch in&s;tances? He mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e &s;o. And indeed he in&s;i&s;ts, that in all &s;uch in&s;tances the mind hath two or more <HI>general</HI> determinations, before it comes to a <HI>particular</HI> determination or choice. He &s;uppo&s;eth the mind hath a real preference, if not of the object cho&s;en, yet of its own action&mdash; that it gives it&s;elf up (very <HI>deliberately</HI>) to <HI>accident.</HI> (Doth he mean, that this is done with an expectation that <HI>chance</HI> will direct the mind to the wi&s;e&s;t choice?) Is not this trifling! If there be no apprehended preference, the mind cannot determine, or be determined at all, by his principles. In the in&s;tances he had before him, he grants there is no apprehended preference of one object to the other. Here he ob|&s;erves, <Q>The very act of chu&s;ing one thing rather than another, is prefering that thing.</Q> What <HI>preference</HI> is there in the in&s;tances refered to? On what <HI>ground</HI> or <HI>rea&s;on</HI> is one cho&s;en? To &s;ay there is an act of choice, implying <HI>preference,</HI> between two objects <HI>exactly alike</HI> in every apparent re&s;pect, and yet no previous ground or rea&s;on of that preference, is very hardly reconcileable with Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme, or common &s;en&s;e. We believe it will not be doubted by the genera|lity of mankind, but innumerable in&s;tances occur every day of the will's determination without any perceptible preference. There are determinations, which we beg leave to call <HI>arbitriums,</HI>&mdash;implying no prepollency of motive&mdash;not excited by the <HI>greate&s;t apparent</HI> good, nor <HI>as</HI> this is&mdash;nor the contrary; with re&s;pect to which the mind is <HI>in aequilibrio.</HI> However, &s;uch <HI>arbitriums</HI> &s;eem not to belong to the &s;ub|ject of <HI>morality</HI> and <HI>religion.</HI> They &s;till &s;ubvert Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ary connection.</P>
<P>"The exerci&s;e of liberty," &s;ays the learned Burlamaqui, <Q>never di&s;plays it&s;elf more than in indifferent things. I find, for in&s;tance, that it depends entirely on my&s;elf to &s;tretch out or draw back my hand; to &s;it down or to walk; to direct my &s;teps to the right or left, &amp;c. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, where the &s;oul is left entirely to it|&s;elf, either for want of external motives, or by rea&s;on of the oppo|&s;ition, and, as it were, the equilibrium of the&s;e motives, if it deter|mines on one &s;ide, this may be &s;aid to be the pure effect of its plea&s;ure and good will, and of the command it has over its own actions.</Q> Vol. I. p. 20, 21.</P>
<P>As to the mind's giving it&s;elf up to <HI>accident,</HI> this ca&s;e is wrongly &s;tated. Where the mind has a full per&s;ua&s;ion there is no preferable|ne&s;s of one ob&s;ect to another, is in&s;tantly convinc'd they are exactly alike, it cannot be &s;aid to give it&s;elf up to accident. It hath no choice or preference, is perfectly indifferent (not whether it hath <HI>either,</HI> but) <HI>which</HI> it hath. It doth not tarry to make one general re&s;olution after another before it comes to a conclu&s;ion; but determines immediately. If the mind may be &s;aid to give it&s;elf up to accident at all, it is in in|&s;tances where it is well known in general, that the i&s;&s;ue of its deter|mination may be either fortunate or unfortunate; but neither being extant in the minds view beforehand, and the event being altogether independent of any human circum&s;pection, the mind determines with|out a perception of the con&s;equences&mdash;which it leaves to time and fortune. As in purcha&s;ing tickets in a lottery.</P>
<P>To pretend, that though the mind has no preference of the <HI>object</HI> cho&s;en, in things indifferent, yet it hath of it's own <HI>act,</HI> is frivolous.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>Virtuous or vicious elections mu&s;t proceed upon motive. And we grant that the greate&s;t good really <HI>ought</HI> to deter|mine moral agents; but that it in fact always <HI>doth,</HI> even where it is perceived, we deny. Where there is both a <HI>real</HI> and <HI>evident</HI> preferablene&s;s, there can be no di&s;pute as to the <HI>obligations</HI> of moral agents. But even where there is a manife&s;t as well as real preference, their election is not <HI>always</HI> governed hereby. 'Tis too common, indeed, that the pa&s;&s;ions bias and pervert the moral judgment. Some|times they <HI>precipitate</HI> this judgment, when a little reflecti|on would have been &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve the rectitude of it. Sometimes they blind and corrupt this judgment by <HI>re|tarding</HI>

it, (in the manner ob&s;erved in the preceeding &s;ection) to find out palliations, excu&s;es, or ju&s;tifying circum&s;tances for vice, that men may indulge their various lu&s;ts, and yet be on good terms with their con&s;ciences. By &s;uch means, the light in men becomes darkne&s;s; they call evil good, and good evil; put bitter for &s;weet, and &s;weet for bitter.</P>
<P>Still we think nothing is more evidently fal&s;e than the opinion, that the affections evermore follow the la&s;t prac|tical judgment of the under&s;tanding. Perception and vo|lition are as different as &s;ight and ta&s;te. Moral agents ma|ny times &s;in immediately again&s;t pre&s;ent light and convicti|on, while they have <HI>full in their view</HI> the wi&s;er choice. And what is this but to determine them&s;elves contrary to the greate&s;t apparent good? Through the impetuo&s;ity of their lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, they break over the cleare&s;t bonds,

natural, civil and religious&mdash;the force of which they have &s;ometimes a lively &s;en&s;e of even in the article of &s;ining; perceiving the direct tendency of &s;uch violations to ruin them in this world and another.

<P>Every delaying &s;inner acts again&s;t the greate&s;t apparent good, while he promi&s;eth him&s;elf a future time of repen|tance, and repenteth not immediately. When &s;uch hear the importance and excellency of religion repre&s;ented in &s;ome judicious moral di&s;cour&s;e, or &s;ee the &s;ame exemplifi|ed in real life, they highly approve it in their judgment; they &s;ee it to be their wi&s;dom; but their practice is at va|riance with the <HI>apparent</HI> good&mdash;So much at variance, that they are obliged to make ineffectual promi&s;es of becoming wi&s;e &s;oon, and are much di&s;&s;atisfied with them&s;elves that they have not been long ago. The &s;ituation of many great &s;inners on a &s;ick bed, in the apprehen&s;ion of death, is wont to alarm others of a like character. They &s;ee the right and good way; but per&s;i&s;t in their &s;ins again&s;t their <HI>evident</HI> intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Different con&s;iderations are adapted to influence diffe|rent per&s;ons, who have diver&s;e apprehen&s;ions of intere&s;t, according to the diver&s;ity of their temper and talents, education and circum&s;tances. But to confound all di&s;|tinction between motives and moral habits, as Mr. Ed|wards doth, is to blend things that differ&mdash;to contradict rea&s;on and him&s;elf. For he tells us, volition <HI>follows</HI> per|ception, is <HI>excited</HI> by it, and the <HI>effect</HI> of it&mdash;that motives are <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;es. Surely then they are different from volition. And if (as has been &s;hewn) volition is not <HI>al|ways</HI> as the highe&s;t motive; then, when the&s;e really meet, it is not <HI>nece&s;&s;arily;</HI> that is, not in the way Mr. Edwards contends for. One in&s;tance failing, the chain is broken. One link, or "10,000, breaks the chain alike."</P>
<P>Motives exhibited to a moral agent may be &s;trong or weak according to the attention given to them. Mo&s;t pre&s;umptuous &s;ins may proceed from &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion or inattention. It has been hinted, that Adam's fir&s;t &s;in may
<PB N="41" REF="012746_0038_0F8BEDA8777E0E00">
be accounted for in this way. And if the <HI>manner</HI> of the mind's viewing an object may be the cau&s;e of its chu&s;ing or refu&s;ing, (as Mr. Edwards ob&s;erves) we enquire, Whence is it, but from a cau&s;e <HI>in it&s;elf,</HI> that the mind views an object as it doth?</P>
<P>On Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme and our own, extrin&s;ic mo|tives are concerned, as they have <HI>po&s;itive influence,</HI> in moral volitions. The difference is, Mr. Edwards (more gene|rally) teacheth, that they are moral cau&s;es&punc; and that the will and the highe&s;t motive nece&s;&s;arily unite. We a&s;&s;ert, that moral agents are them&s;elves the efficients of their own volitions, and that there is no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary union between volition and the highe&s;t motive. The advantage our &s;cheme hath may, perhaps, appear from applying the doc|trine wherein we are agreed with him to a particular ca&s;e &mdash;that of the fir&s;t &s;inful volition of the prince of darkne&s;s. The motive to this volition was extant in his mind. It had <HI>po&s;itive influence</HI> to excite and move to the volition. His rebellion was the con&s;equence. Was it therefore the greate&s;t <HI>apparent</HI> good? Had he a principle of action within him&s;elf, either to concur with or reject the exhibited motive? If he had, then the cau&s;e of this volition was in him&s;elf, and our doctrine of &s;elf-determination is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed. If he had not, then let it be granted that the motive exhibited was the efficient of the volition. But what ad|vantage will this conce&s;&s;ion be to Mr. Edwards's cau&s;e? It follows from it, either that this efficiency is ultimately to be a&s;cribed to God, and that the energy or cau&s;ality is ultimately his; (&s;ince by his di&s;po&s;ing and determining providence &s;uch efficacious motive to rebel was pre&s;ented to the view of an innocent and holy being) or that God him&s;elf is properly no moral cau&s;e, but &s;ubject, as crea|tures are &s;uppo&s;ed to be, to &s;ome extrin&s;ic efficiency and de|termination. And indeed this is the true re&s;ult of Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme. The divine being is not &s;elf-deter|mined&mdash;is no proper efficient cau&s;e. <HI>Fatali&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Athei&s;ts</HI> will not fail to make improvement on this &s;y&s;tem. On the &s;ubject of moral agency, it is therefore of great impor|tance to keep up a di&s;tinction between the <HI>influence</HI> of motives, and <HI>cau&s;ality</HI> or <HI>efficiency.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="012746_0039_0F8BEDAAC6F48480">To &s;ay that volition &s;prings from it&s;elf, is a very diffe|rent thing from &s;aying, that the &s;ubject is the cau&s;e of it.

<P>Upon the whole, it is agreed that moral agency may con&s;i&s;t with the want of &s;pontaneous, animal agency, or the liberty of the <HI>executive</HI> powers.

They have not a moral faculty, indeed: But if this makes only a <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> or <HI>adventitious</HI> difference in their elections and actions, it is a difference no way material; &s;ince &s;uch accidental diffe|rences make no beings either virtuous or vicious. It &s;eems apparent, that Mr. Edwards has totally excluded liberty from every thing wherein the nature of virtue and vice is properly concerned.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. On nece&s;&s;ity.</HEAD>
<P>TO make his doctrine of univer&s;al nece&s;&s;ity con&s;i&s;tent with moral agency and accountablene&s;s, Mr. Ed|wards in&s;i&s;ts much on <HI>two</HI> kinds of nece&s;&s;ity; one of which he calls natural; the other, moral. It is needful to exhibit his doctrine, and make a few remarks thereon, that the reader may judge of the merits of this di&s;tinction. After which &s;ome things will be ob&s;erved with a view, if po&s;&s;ible, to ca&s;t a little light on the ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ubject of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, rendered more ab&s;tru&s;e than before, by Mr. Ed|ward's refinements and &s;ubtilties.</P>
<P>He frequently adverti&s;eth his readers, that when he ap|plieth the term <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> to moral &s;ubjects, he u&s;eth it "as a term of <HI>art</HI>"&mdash;that when the words <HI>nece&s;&s;ary, impo&s;&s;ible, irre&s;i&s;tible, unable,</HI> &amp;c. are applied to moral agency, they are <Q>either u&s;ed in &s;ome new &s;en&s;e diver&s;e from their o|riginal and proper meaning, or with perfect in&s;ignifican|ce and non&s;en&s;e: For no inability what&s;oever, which is meerly moral, is properly called by the name of inabi|lity.</Q> (P. 21, 22, 232, 287. <HI>et pa&s;&s;im.</HI>) Did not Mr. Edwards then mean by moral nece&s;&s;ity any <HI>real</HI> nece&s;&s;ity? Did he u&s;e words as "non&s;en&s;ically" as other metaphy&s;i|cians?</P>
<P>While in common &s;peech no proper nece&s;&s;ity at all is meant by the u&s;e of the terms moral nece&s;&s;ity, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When in common &s;peech it is &s;aid, that any particular things are morally nece&s;&s;ary, or morally impo&s;&s;ible, by way of di&s;tinction from natural nece&s;&s;ity or impo&s;&s;ibility, nothing more is intended than to ex|pre&s;s, on the one hand, the degree of <HI>probability,</HI> or at mo&s;t <HI>moral certainty,</HI> that &s;uch events will take place: Or, on the other hand, the <HI>difficulty</HI> that is in the way, and the <HI>moral evidence</HI> that they will not become effect. 'Tis not meant that there is any proper nece&s;&s;ity in the ca&s;e. When we &s;ay, We <HI>mu&s;t</HI> do or forbear &s;uch things&mdash;we <HI>cannot</HI> but do or forbear them&mdash;we are <HI>nece&s;&s;itated</HI> to do or forbear them, we would only expre&s;s the &s;trength of obligation upon us, or the &s;trong inducements we are under, in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation and circum&s;tances, to do or omit them, When we &s;ay of a man of approved veracity and fidelity, that he <HI>cannot</HI> lie, or violate his tru&s;t and engagements, we mean that we have moral certainty he will &s;peak the truth, and be faithful to his promi&s;es, to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him&mdash;that we have the highe&s;t rea&s;on to think &s;o, and no &s;u&s;picion to the contrary; Not &s;uppo&s;ing but it may be barely <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> however improbable, that he may prove fal&s;e and unfaithful. (For &s;uch men &s;ometimes act un|worthy of their general character, to the great &s;urprize of their ac|quaintance.) When it is &s;aid of tho&s;e who have been long accu&s;tomed to do evil, that they <HI>cannot</HI> learn to do well, by this is only &s;ignified the extreme difficulty of their reforming; the great improbability of it. We &s;ometimes &s;ay, it is next to impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch &s;hould be re|claimed, and find their recovery in &s;cripture re&s;embled to a natural impo&s;&s;ibility. (Jer. XIII. 23.) The meaning is not, that there is any &s;trict nece&s;&s;ity of their per&s;i&s;ting in &s;in. There have been in&s;tances of &s;uch per&s;ons reclaimed, and there may be again, great as their dan|ger is. Therefore we cannot &s;ay, 'tis ab&s;olutely certain others of this character will never be reduced; much le&s;s that there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of their continuing unreformed. The &s;everal in&s;tances pro|duced by Mr. Edwards (P. 34.) will all apply again&s;t him&s;elf. Habit in many in&s;tances is indeed &s;o &s;trong, that we are wont to call it &s;econd nature&mdash;ob&s;erving, however, (to prevent confu&s;ion in our ideas) that it is <HI>morally</HI> &s;peaking impo&s;&s;ible to alter it&mdash;<HI>next</HI> to impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;Inti|mating, by this manner of expre&s;&s;ing our&s;elves, that though it be po&s;|&s;ible, it is in an high degree improbable. Thus by moral nece&s;&s;ity we mean not a &s;trict nece&s;&s;ity, but prefix the epithet <HI>moral</HI> to prevent any &s;uch inference.</NOTE> Mr. Ed|wards

manife&s;tly intends hereby a real nece&s;&s;ity, and in his definition of moral nece&s;&s;ity includes what properly be|longs to natural&mdash;applying to it the following epithets, <HI>infallible, unalterable, unfru&s;trable, unavoidable</HI>&mdash;and &s;aying (P. 30.) "moral nece&s;&s;ity is as <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> as natural." But let us more particularly attend to his own explanation of the di&s;tinction between natural and moral nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>"By <HI>natural nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> as applied to men, I mean," &s;aith he, <Q>&s;uch nece&s;&s;ity as men are under through the force of natural cau&s;es; as di&s;tingui&s;hed from what are called moral cau&s;es, &s;uch as habits and di&s;po&s;itions of the heart, and moral motives and inducements. By <HI>moral nece&s;&s;ity</HI> is meant that nece&s;&s;ity of connection and con&s;equence, which ari&s;eth from the &s;trength of &s;uch moral cau&s;es as the &s;trength of inclination, or motives, and the connec|tion which there is in many ca&s;es between the&s;e, and &s;uch certain volitions and actions.</Q> (P. 29.) To pre|vent any mi&s;take of his meaning, he gives us notice of the&s;e three things. Fir&s;t, that moral nece&s;&s;ity may be as ab&s;o|lute
<PB N="45" REF="012746_0042_0F8BEDACFA205730">
as natural nece&s;&s;ity. Secondly, That moral events are owing to the nature of things. Thirdly, that nece&s;&s;i|ty, as applied by him to moral &s;ubjects, is not u&s;ed accor|ding to the original de&s;ign and meaning of the word.</P>
<P>Here we have occa&s;ion to apply Mr. Edwards's own words, P. 287. <Q>'Tis very evident, that in the metaphy|&s;ical di&s;tinction between</Q> natural and moral nece&s;&s;ity, <Q>due care has not been taken to conform language to the nature of things, or to any di&s;tinct clear ideas&mdash;which has occa&s;ioned inexpre&s;&s;ible difficulty, contention, error and confu&s;ion.</Q> (P. 279.) <Q>Tho&s;e are a precarious &s;ort of demon&s;trations, which men build on the mean|ing they arbitrarily affix to a word; e&s;pecially when that meaning is ab&s;tru&s;e, incon&s;i&s;tent, and entirely di|ver&s;e from the original &s;en&s;e of the word in common &s;peech.</Q> We know of no writer that his u&s;ed words more <HI>arbitrarily,</HI> and <HI>ab&s;tru&s;ely;</HI> or built more <HI>precarious demon&s;trations</HI> on &s;uch u&s;e of them. What is offered on the article of nece&s;&s;ity &s;eems peculiarly liable to this ex|ception.</P>
<P>To recur to the di&s;tinction of natural and moral nece&s;|&s;ity. The great jumble and confu&s;ion of ideas in the a|fore&s;aid explanation is to be regretted.</P>
<P>By "nece&s;&s;ity of connection and con&s;equence" we ob|tain no idea of moral nece&s;&s;ity as di&s;tinct from natural. To &s;ay in explanation hereof, that the volitions of moral agents are connected immediately or mediately with what is nece&s;&s;ary in its own nature, and &s;o are nece&s;&s;ary by a nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;equence, (P. 25; 29.) is &s;o far from help|ing us to di&s;tingui&s;h moral nece&s;&s;ity from natural, that the attempt to explain doth but confound the di&s;tinction, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be of much importance. According to this explanation, moral actions are effects of natural nece&s;&s;ity, when traced up to their true cau&s;e. For &s;aith Mr. Edwards, <Q>Things which are <HI>perfectly connected</HI> with other things that are nece&s;&s;ary [in their own nature] are <HI>them&s;elves</HI> nece&s;&s;ary, by a nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;equence.</Q> The volitions of accountable creatures not being in their own nature nece&s;&s;ary, are &s;o ina&s;much as they are perfectly con|nected with, and certainly follow from, the divine exi&s;|tence
<PB N="46" REF="012746_0043_0F8BEDADBA3FB288">
and perfections. As this is to a&s;&s;ert, that God is the original moral cau&s;e of &s;in, &s;o it is finally to a&s;&s;ert that &s;in aro&s;e from a nece&s;&s;ity in the nature of things. Do we yet perceive any difference between natural and moral nece&s;&s;i|ty, on this &s;tate of the matter? The divine exi&s;tence is eternal, and therefore ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in its own na|ture.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We enquire not into the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of the divine exi&s;tence, which al|together &s;urpa&s;&s;eth our perception. Vid. Examination, Part II. Sect. 1.</NOTE> The volitions of creatures are perfectly connected with the divine exi&s;tence and conduct. And are they not then nece&s;&s;ary with a natural nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Further, What doth Mr. Edwards mean by a <HI>moral</HI> cau&s;e? <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>"We give in general the name of moral cau&s;e of an action to the <HI>per&s;on</HI> that produced it, either in the whole or part, by a determination of his will; whether he executes it him&s;elf phy&s;ically and immediate|ly, &s;o as to be the author thereof; or whether he procures it by the act of &s;ome other per&s;on, and becomes thereby it's cau&s;e."</P>
<BIBL>Burlamaqui, Vol. I. P. 238.</BIBL></NOTE> In the pa&s;&s;age under pre&s;ent examination, and through his book, he blends moral motives and induce|ments with moral habits, inclinations and di&s;po&s;itions, as though they were preci&s;ely the &s;ame, and indi&s;criminately calls them moral cau&s;es. Here are &s;everal things unintel|ligible.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The <HI>difference</HI> between a moral di&s;po&s;ition and a moral volition &s;hould have been pointed out. For moral volitions and actions, upon this &s;cheme, are immediately connected with moral habits and di&s;po&s;itions as their moral cau&s;e. Or if there be no difference, then it &s;hould have been &s;hewn,</P>
<P>Secondly, How the &s;ame moral habit, which is a moral volition or act, is al&s;o the moral cau&s;e of <HI>it&s;elf</HI>&mdash;cau&s;e and effect at the &s;ame time, and in regard to the &s;ame thing&mdash; the &s;ubject of its own efficiency. Were this conceivable, &s;till,</P>
<P>Thirdly, How is a moral habit [or motive] <HI>before</HI> and <HI>previous</HI> to it&s;elf? How hath it a <HI>tendency,</HI> by po&s;itive in|fluence and action, to <HI>move</HI> and <HI>excite</HI> to it&s;elf? How is it the cau&s;e of that <HI>exertion,</HI> which, by &s;uppo&s;ition, is ex|erted before its influence and motion is applied for the purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>Fourthly, If motives are nothing di&s;tinct from moral habits and inclinations, then they are not <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;es of
<PB N="47" REF="012746_0044_0F8BEDAE7A1078B0">
&s;uch inclinations and habits, as Mr. Edwards often &s;tiles them&mdash;are not the <HI>medium</HI> of producing &s;uch habits.</P>
<P>Fifthly, If moral volitions are connected with their moral cau&s;e by a nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>con&s;equence,</HI> then it &s;eems, the cau&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity are <HI>prior</HI> to the volitions, and that the volitions them&s;elves <HI>follow,</HI> as effects follow their cau&s;es. But how can they be <HI>con&s;equent,</HI> if a moral motive be a moral di&s;po&s;ition, as it is certain a moral di&s;po&s;ition is a moral volition? We would, if po&s;&s;ible, di&s;cover the <HI>peculiar</HI> connection which Mr. Edwards &s;uppo&s;eth there is between one and the &s;ame thing, &s;o as to di&s;cern how it is a moral cau&s;e and a moral effect of&mdash;it&s;elf! We cannot ea&s;ily apprehend what he means by moral nece&s;&s;ity; or perceive where the difference lies, according to him, be|tween natural and moral nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Further, When Mr. Edwards &s;aith, that the nature of the connection between moral cau&s;es and effects is the &s;ame as in natural cau&s;es and effects&mdash;that they differ only as the terms connected are di&s;&s;imilar, this doth but en|tangle the &s;ubject &s;till more: For if there be no difference in the nature of the connection; if this be alike indi&s;&s;olu|ble in the one as in the other, is not then the nece&s;&s;ity the &s;ame? what proper di&s;tinction is there between natural and moral nece&s;&s;ity? Doth he mean al&s;o to confound na|tural cau&s;es and effects as he doth moral? to &s;ay, in like manner, that a natural effect is the natural cau&s;e of it&s;elf? the object of its own influence and action? producer and produced?</P>
<P>Further, This connection between moral volitions and their moral cau&s;es is &s;aid to take place <HI>in many ca&s;es.</HI> If it <HI>ever</HI> fails, how is the connection <Q>&s;ure and perfect&mdash;ac|cording to e&s;tabli&s;hed laws?</Q> If the connection may in <HI>any</HI> ca&s;e be broken, there is no nece&s;&s;ity. 'Tis not as ab|&s;olute, as unfru&s;trable as natural nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Further, As nothing except the <HI>divine exi&s;tence and per|fections</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary in it&s;elf, or in nature; according to Mr. Edwards him&s;elf; when he &s;aith moral nece&s;&s;ity is as ab|&s;olute and irr&s;i&s;tible as natural, doth he mean that the mo|ral volitions of creatures are as nece&s;&s;ary as the exi&s;tence of God? Apply this to his own doctrine re&s;pecting the
<PB N="48" REF="012746_0045_0F8BEDAF3A161A18">
origin of evil, and either the ab&s;olutene&s;s of moral nece&s;&s;i|ty mu&s;t be given up, or the moral character of the Deity di&s;believed. Was it Adam's original bias and di&s;po&s;ition to rebel again&s;t God? If it was, he was created a rebel. And what tho'ts mu&s;t we entertain of the creator, from whom immediately he derived this bias? Can we di&s;tin|gui&s;h his being created in &s;in from natural nece&s;&s;ity? If this was not his original di&s;po&s;ition, but the contrary, then he was far from being under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning, as ab|&s;olute as natural nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;his fall was <Q>not owing to na|ture.</Q></P>
<P>Or &s;uppo&s;e the fir&s;t &s;inful volition really nece&s;&s;ary in the way Mr. Edwards contends for, what e&s;&s;ential diffe|rence could there be between a nece&s;&s;ity <HI>without</HI> the will, and a nece&s;&s;ity <HI>within</HI> it? Evil di&s;po&s;itions originally im|planted in the creature, or infu&s;ed into him afterwards, or proceeding from the want of divine influence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, cannot render the &s;ubject thereof criminal, nor can pro|perly be called evil as relative to him, as may be &s;hewn in the next &s;ection. To &s;ay in this ca&s;e, <Q>'Tis his very nature; he is of a vile natural temper, 'tis as natural for him to act &s;o as it is to breathe; he can't help &s;er|ving the devil,</Q> &amp;c. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Edwards, p. 304.</NOTE> would be a full excu&s;e, provi|ded &s;uch a nature and temper were originally implanted or infu&s;ed by the creator, or aro&s;e from the want of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. And as the fir&s;t &s;inful volition was as ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary as any following ones, and the fir&s;t in the &s;eries determineth all the re&s;t, on Mr. Edwards's plan&mdash;as the nece&s;&s;ity he pleads for is not even pretended to de|rive from the fall, nor the &s;in of Adam once mentioned as the &s;ource of it, but took place in his innocent &s;tate, and was prior to the fall of angels; &s;o we may well ob|&s;erve, that in the creature's original &s;tate a nece&s;&s;ity <HI>in</HI> the will or <HI>without</HI> it mu&s;t amount to the &s;ame thing. In &s;uch &s;tate, to &s;uppo&s;e an indi&s;po&s;ition, or moral inability, or op|po&s;ition of will to holine&s;s would be to admit as full an ex|cu&s;e as any inability <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> to the will can be&mdash;it would be a proper natural nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;an original defect of pow|ers or advantages to do what was required.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="012746_0046_0F9090CA068B00C8">Might not then the fall of angels and man have been prevented? Mr. Edwards has intimated that it might. If &s;o, then it is clear, it could not be nece&s;&s;ary with the irre|&s;i&s;tible, ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity he pleads for. To &s;uppo&s;e it was <HI>really</HI> nece&s;&s;ary, though in the lowe&s;t degree, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Moral nece&s;&s;ity, Mr. Edwards &s;uppo&s;eth, admits of degrees.</NOTE> is the &s;ame as to &s;uppo&s;e it nece&s;&s;ary in the highe&s;t degree, the event being alike &s;ure on either &s;uppo&s;ition. To illu&s;trate the matter by an in&s;tance from Mr. Edwards. Suppo&s;e a man required to lift a weight of 101 lb. who&s;e natural &s;trength is only equal to a weight of 100 lb. he is as really unable to lift 101 as 1000 lb. And it would be as really contrary to rea&s;on to require him to lift one pound beyond his &s;trength as nine hundred. Was there a moral inabili|ty &s;imilar to this in our fir&s;t parents in their primitive &s;tate? In this ca&s;e "doing wrong with the <HI>will,</HI>" or <Q>from the heart,</Q> would be far from being <Q>the &s;um total of the matter,</Q> in our e&s;timation of blame-worthine&s;s. (P. 298, 299.) We naturally a&s;cend to the &s;ource and fountain of this wrong will or heart, and enquire whe|ther the &s;ubject had the nece&s;&s;ary means of willing other|wi&s;e? If the &s;tate of his will or heart was originally fixed by nece&s;&s;ity, common &s;en&s;e at once acquits him of blame. Were angels and our common progenitors thus abandon|ed of God!</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;in, there was a want or oppo&s;ition of will to what was required by the Creator. Was this want or oppo&s;ition of will nece&s;&s;ary before the fir&s;t &s;in took place? If not, then there was a freedom from moral nece&s;&s;ity at lea&s;t with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t act of &s;in. Or if the fir&s;t di&s;inclination to, and non-compliance with, duty, was founded in nece&s;&s;ity, who placed the creature under that nece&s;&s;ity? He mu&s;t have had power originally to pre&s;erve his innocence, or the nece&s;&s;ity of his forfeiting it mu&s;t have been a natural nece&s;&s;ity. Which &s;ide &s;oever Mr. Ed|wards's &s;cheme embraceth, it is &s;ubverted.</P>
<P>To evince the con&s;i&s;tency of his doctrine of nece&s;&s;ity with the highe&s;t worthine&s;s of prai&s;e and moral e&s;teem, Mr. Edwards takes frequent occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that God po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the mo&s;t perfect liberty, and is notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="50" REF="012746_0047_0F9090CB8C613468">
nece&s;&s;arily holy, &amp;c. In the &s;ame view he mentions the nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t's holine&s;s. We grant that God is ne|ce&s;&s;arily holy&mdash;that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;o; but &s;ee not how this "clearly and ab&s;olutely determines the controver&s;y,"</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Mr. Edwards maintains, that the <HI>perfection of the divine under&s;tanding</HI> is the foundation of the immutable rectitude of his will. Now as the moral intellect in crea|tures is &s;o very imperfect, there can be no infering the nece&s;&s;ity of their wills from the nece&s;&s;ity of the divine. Mr. Edwards would not &s;ay, that the volitions of holy angels are determined to the right &s;ide in the &s;ame manner as the divine will is determined to holine&s;s. For then their knowledge mu&s;t be perfect as his. Or if, notwith|&s;tanding the imperfection of their knowledge, their wills always have been, are, and will be as unalterably deter|mined to holine&s;s, then it mu&s;t be in &s;ome <HI>other</HI> way, on &s;ome other foundation, equally &s;ure and &s;tedfa&s;t, not yet pointed out. Should it be &s;uppo&s;ed further, that they are now confirmed in a &s;tate of holine&s;s beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a defection; yet we conjecture that they (as well as other finite beings) have been, in &s;ome part of their dura|tion, upon trial in &s;uch &s;en&s;e as implies danger of mi&s;car|rying. Beings in their &s;ituation once, have actually fallen.</P>
<P>Secondly, We have no objection to the opinion, that the rectitude of the divine will is nece&s;&s;ary. But why this nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould be called <HI>moral,</HI> by way of di&s;tinction from <HI>natural,</HI> we &s;ee not. When we di&s;tingui&s;h the moral from the natural perfections of God, we do indeed &s;uppo&s;e that the latter would be no perfections were it not for the for|mer. At the &s;ame time, there is an evident contradiction in &s;uppo&s;ing a being to exi&s;t, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the attributes, which for di&s;tinction's &s;ake are called the natural perfec|tions of God, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing perfect moral rectitude.</P>
<P>Holine&s;s, ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s belong to the divine nature as much as power, omni&s;cience, immen&s;ity, &amp;c. He is by nece&s;&s;ity <HI>of nature</HI> holy, ju&s;t and good, no le&s;s than he is, by the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity, eternal, infinite, omnipotent, omni&s;|cient. When it is &s;aid, God <HI>cannot</HI> do wickedly, this is to be under&s;tood as denoting a &s;trict nece&s;&s;ity. Who ever

<P>But whatever moral inability belongs to unregenerate men by nature, and notwith&s;tanding the means and a&s;&s;i&s;tan|ces of grace, nothing is plainer than this, that Calvini&s;tic divines have ever con&s;idered the inability of mankind to holine&s;s as the natural and judicial con&s;equences of &s;in. They &s;uppo&s;e the fir&s;t &s;in of Adam to be the &s;ource of &s;uch inability in him, and in his po&s;terity. They &s;uppo&s;e it was not natural to Adam, but is to his de&s;cendants.

Yet Mr. Edwards, though he maintains the &s;ame inability in the creature, while innocent, as in fallen creatures, and a&s;&s;erts it to be of the moral kind only, all along holds his own doctrine up to view as the doc|trine of Calvini&s;ts; and repre&s;ents the oppo&s;ers of it, through his whole book, as Arminians, Pelagians, Soci|nians, Je&s;uits, &amp;c. With what fairne&s;s, let the public judge. By his own conce&s;&s;ion Dr. Watts de&s;erved to be ranked with writers of a very different cla&s;s. Yet the Doctor's e&s;&s;ay on freedom of will is as diver&s;e from Mr. Edwards on the will as the Chri&s;tian's bible is from the Mahometan's.

<P>In our controver&s;y with Mr. Edwards, there is, indeed, no occa&s;ion to examine the impotency of fallen man. Ac|cording to him, Adam in innocence was morally unable to retain the &s;piritual image of God, with which he is &s;uppo&s;|ed to have been endowed. (This mu&s;t have been, by the way, a natural as well as moral inability&mdash;an inability ori|ginal to him, no le&s;s in his under&s;tanding than in his will.) If he had power to have viewed things in a different man|ner, the &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ity is overthrown. His fir&s;t want or oppo&s;ition of will to what was required of him was his fir&s;t &s;in. How came he by this want or oppo&s;ition of will? It was not original to him, if he was created with the moral image of God. To the efficient cau&s;e we mu&s;t attribute his fir&s;t indi&s;po&s;ition or oppo&s;ition to his duty, whoever or whatever that cau&s;e be. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Edwards, p. 103.</NOTE> 'Tis indeed ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that after this oppo&s;ition to duty was become effect, he could have annihilated it, or cau&s;ed it not to be. But might he have pre&s;erved the &s;ame actual will to wor&s;hip and obey God after the exhibition of &s;atan's temptation, as before? Did the extancy of this temptation in his mind make or con&s;titute him a &s;inner? (No &s;urely; for our Lord him&s;elf was tempted by the devil, yet without &s;in.) After the temptation was extant, had he an immediate power to call the motives of religion to view, and re&s;i&s;t the &s;ugge&s;tions of the adver&s;ary? If not, how could &s;in lie at his door? Was his moral inability of his own procuring? or could he remove it? If neither, Mr. Edwards's di&s;tinc|tion of natural and moral nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t appear trifling. <Q>The &s;tate of the moral world depends on the u&s;e they make of natural agency, and &s;o depends on their voli|tions,</Q> (Edwards p. 162.) which volitions are indepen|dent of them&s;elves, and proceed from an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e&mdash; even from him who gave them being.

<P>MR.

of &s;omething <HI>negative</HI> on God's part, or follows from the <HI>want</HI> of his influence, and from this <HI>only.</HI> Whereas Mr. Edwards con&s;tantly a&s;&s;erts, that God is the <HI>determiner, or|derer,</HI> and <HI>deci&s;ive di&s;po&s;er</HI> of this event. 'Tis not &s;ufficient with him to &s;ay, that God is <Q>the permitter, or not a hin|derer of &s;in;</Q> but he is careful immediately to add, <Q>and at the &s;ame time a di&s;po&s;er of the &s;tate of events, in &s;uch a manner, that &s;in will mo&s;t certainly and infallibly fol|low.</Q> (P. 3 57, 367.) Now is God's <HI>determining, order|ing</HI> and <HI>actually di&s;po&s;ing</HI> things in his providence, in a <HI>deci|&s;ive</HI> manner, a meer negative?

<P N="2">2. Admit the exi&s;tence of &s;in to be the con&s;equence, not of any po&s;itive influence of the deity, but to follow only from his forbearing to influence and a&s;&s;i&s;t the creature, in like manner as darkne&s;s and fro&s;t in the night follow upon the <HI>departure</HI> of the &s;un&mdash;admit that God is not the <HI>efficient</HI> cau&s;e of &s;in; it will then follow, that the &s;inful being him|&s;elf mu&s;t be this cau&s;e.

And on this &s;up|po&s;ition, the moral perfections and government of God, and revealed religion, mu&s;t be di&s;believed.</P>
<P>But his doctrine re&s;pecting the manner of &s;in's coming into exi&s;tence &s;hall be examined &s;omewhat di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>If &s;in aro&s;e from God's withdrawing his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and influence, it will then follow that the creature <HI>had origi|nally</HI> &s;uch influence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance as was <HI>&s;ufficient to pre|vent</HI> apo&s;tacy. Otherwi&s;e this would not be the con&s;e|quence of the <HI>withdraw</HI> of divine influence, but more pro|perly the con&s;equence of the <HI>deficiency</HI> of &s;uch influence. And the ca&s;e of the &s;un's departure from our horizon would be very impertinently u&s;ed to exemplify this event. For &s;uppo&s;e the creature never had &s;ufficient divine influence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;ecure his primitive rectitude, his &s;tate would have been analogous to primitive darkne&s;s and e|ternal night. And becau&s;e he did not walk in the light of the &s;un, without having ever enjoy'd its enlivening beams, he is con&s;igned (or obnoxious) to blackne&s;s or darkne&s;s forever.</P>
<P>If therefore there is any pertinency in the in&s;tance Mr.

Edwards brings, the creature once had &s;uch light, influ|ence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance as might have forever &s;ecured his in|tegrity. Con&s;equently, the apo&s;tacy might have been pre|vented. The only enquiry is, whether it were owing to God, or the creature. Mr. Edwards maintains it was ow|ing to the former. Let us &s;ee whether his opinion be re|concileable with the wi&s;dom, holine&s;s and goodne&s;s, or e|ven ju&s;tice of God.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that the apo&s;tacy was the con&s;equence of God's forbearing to communicate his influence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, yet that it was a blameable thing in the creature, is not le&s;s glaringly fal&s;e and impious than it would be to &s;ay, that God requires a rational conduct of tho&s;e whom he hath not endowed with the natural under&s;tanding of men&mdash;or that he requires moral exerci&s;es and behaviour of the brute creatures&mdash;or requires a creature to live after he hath taken away the breath of life. Either would be contrary to rea&s;on and ju&s;tice&mdash;to demand more than was given&mdash;contrary to that fixed rule of divine government, To him that hath &s;hall be given, and he &s;hall have abundance.</P>
<P>Again, we might much more con&s;i&s;tently &s;uppo&s;e, that God would have put an end to the exi&s;tence of a rational creature, than have continued &s;uch an one in being and withdrawn his influence, previous to any direct forfeiture on the creatures part. The latter would imply inju&s;tice: But the former might not. Exi&s;tence being a free gift at fir&s;t, the continuance of it would have been &s;o, had the creature not &s;inned. The creator might have di&s;continued it without doing any wrong, even &s;uppo&s;ing &s;in had not taken place. But to continue the creature in being, and withhold divine influence from him, in con&s;e|quence of which he is nece&s;&s;arily plunged into a &s;tate of &s;in, mi&s;ery and de&s;peration, would be to give and con|tinue being on terms wor&s;e than not to be at all. If there is no rea&s;on for the former &s;uppo&s;ition; much le&s;s is there for the latter.</P>
<P>This doctrine gives us &s;uch an idea of the parent of the univer&s;e as &s;hocks the fir&s;t principles of rea&s;on, and con|tradicts the cleare&s;t notices God has given of him&s;elf by the light of nature and &s;cripture. Moral agents are <HI>the off|&s;pring

What a contradic|tion to the holy &s;criptures! where we are taught, <HI>God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man.</HI> Shall <HI>any man</HI> then pre&s;ume to <HI>&s;ay, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God?</HI> But what le&s;s doth the doctrine before us amount to than this, that God &s;ecretly de&s;igns all moral evil; placeth temptations to it before his creatures in an irre&s;i&s;tible manner; and de&s;erts them in the hour of dan|ger? What impiety is this! Were &s;uch things &s;poken again&s;t God by the openly profane and ungodly, the injury and reproach would be comparatively &s;mall. But when they are &s;aid under a notion of honoring his name and go|vernment, by the profe&s;&s;ed friends of religion, we mu&s;t beg leave to think, that the utmo&s;t candor can find no &s;ufficient excu&s;e for tho&s;e who are bold and po&s;itive herein. <HI>Humility</HI> and <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> in di&s;qui&s;itions of this kind will al|ways be applauded by the wi&s;e and good; but <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> and <HI>confidence</HI> in a&s;&s;erting, that God is the cau&s;e and pro|ducer of moral evil; accompanied with <HI>uncharitablene&s;s</HI> towards tho&s;e who cannot believe &s;uch doctrine, mu&s;t be very forbiding. <HI>Holy and reverend is his name.</HI> When we &s;peak of his coun&s;els and determinations, the ends and rea&s;ons of his government, it &s;hould be with much diffi|dence&mdash;with jealou&s;y and godly fear, le&s;t we &s;hould re|proach and di&s;honor him, who&s;e glory is above the hea|vens. Coun&s;el may be darkened by multiplying words, and ignorance and temerity manife&s;ted rather than know|ledge and piety. Behold! God is great, and we know him not. How &s;mall a proportion have we heard of him? Can&s;t thou by &s;earching find out God! <HI>This,</HI> however, we clearly know, that God cannot do wickedne&s;s, and hath no plea&s;ure therein; but delighteth in exerci&s;ing judgment, righteou&s;ne&s;s and loving-kindne&s;s in the earth.</P>

It is a matter of notoriety, that &s;ome writers in Europe, who have of late years di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the cau&s;e of irreligion and &s;ceptici&s;m, (both before and &s;ince Mr. Edwards's book appeared) have built on the &s;ame foundation of nece&s;&s;ity. 'Tis to be la|mented, when the friends and public teachers of religion adopt and &s;et them&s;elves to defend, a &s;cheme of doctrine which gives countenance to infidelity. There are tho&s;e a|mong our&s;elves who have the confidence to in&s;ult the re|ligion of their country and the bible, by publickly deli|vering the &s;ame doctrine, for &s;ub&s;tance, as the afore&s;aid author, with little re&s;erve. There is rea&s;on to apprehend people may &s;oon be taught from the pulpit, in &s;o many words, that almighty God fir&s;t infu&s;ed wickedne&s;s into the creature. It is unhappy Mr. Edwards's book has gi|ven

&s;o much countenance to this profane, bla&s;phemous tenet. It &s;eems better not to believe a God, than to enter|tain &s;uch an opinion concerning him. Whether this be not the re&s;ult of Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme, we are content the impartial &s;hould determine.</P>
<P>We have now offered the rea&s;ons of our di&s;&s;ent from Mr. Edwards re&s;pecting the origin of evil. We are fully per&s;uaded it did not, <HI>could</HI> not, come into exi&s;tence in the way he &s;uppo&s;eth&mdash;Yet <HI>how</HI> it in fact came to pa&s;s, that beings made upright have fallen, we acknowledge is to us incomprehen&s;ible&mdash;and apprehend it is &s;o to any hu|man under&s;tanding; not excepting theirs who have at|tempted to account for it. There is a &s;en&s;e in which it is doubtle&s;s true, that &s;in <Q>aro&s;e from the imperfection of the creature;</Q> that is, the creature was not made incapable of &s;ining. He was originally endowed with a freedom to holine&s;s or &s;in: He might have cho&s;en the for|mer, though eventually he cho&s;e the latter. His felicity or mi&s;ery was made to depend on his own election. There was no want of original powers and divine communica|tions in order to his continuance in a &s;tate of moral recti|tude. It therefore remains, that moral evil aro&s;e from a <HI>neglect</HI> or <HI>perver&s;ion</HI> of the powers and divine communi|cations he had in innocence. Angels and men might have continued holy; but mi&s;improved the gifts of God, and thus forfeited his influence and friend&s;hip. So far &s;eems clear: And this is &s;ufficient to vindicate the providence of God in permitting &s;in and mi&s;ery to enter into the world. How it came to pa&s;s, that liberty was originally abu&s;ed, &s;eems to be a matter of unprofitable &s;peculation. To tho&s;e who reject this &s;olution of the matter, and object, that &s;in could not ari&s;e from the abu&s;e of liberty, &s;ome farther reply may, however, be made in the ninth &s;ection.</P>
<P>N. B. In our examination of Mr. Edwards, (p. 64.) it was <HI>incidentally</HI> noted from him, that "God deci&s;ively orders all the volitions of moral agents by a po&s;itive in|fluence"&mdash;he adds in the place refered to, "or permi&s;&s;ion." We tru&s;t it has been fully &s;hewn, that he intends an <HI>effica|cious</HI> permi&s;&s;ion&mdash;to "decide, determine, direct, is to <HI>act,</HI>"

<HEAD>SECTION V. On the connection between the nature and cau&s;e of volition.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a favourite di&s;tinction with Mr. Edwards, that <Q>the e&s;&s;ence of vertue and vice lies in the <HI>nature</HI> of volition, not in the <HI>cau&s;e.</HI></Q> We before took &s;ome &s;light notice of the futility of this di&s;tinction. We knew, in|deed, that the con&s;i&s;tency of Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme de|pended not a little on the propriety of di&s;tingui&s;hing the nature of moral actions from their cau&s;e: But had we re|pre&s;ented &s;uch a di&s;tinction as really important, <HI>upon his plan,</HI> po&s;&s;ibly it might have been e&s;teem'd invidious. However, we are <HI>now</HI> con&s;trained to &s;ay, &s;uch a repre&s;en|tation wou'd have been the exact truth. And though we &s;till think the di&s;tinction futile and eva&s;ive, yet we have a rea&s;on, which we had not when we wrote before, for giving this matter a particular con&s;ideration. Our having been publickly called upon (not in very obliging terms <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on moral agency, part I. &s;ect. 4.</NOTE>) to point out the weakne&s;s of this di&s;tinction, will excu&s;e us with the reader, &s;hou'd he think more notice is now taken of it, than it really de&s;erves.</P>
<P>We &s;hall fir&s;t examine the merits of this di&s;tinction&mdash; and then remind the reader of the importance of it <HI>on Mr. Edwards's plan.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Of the <HI>merits</HI> of it. To &s;ay the <HI>e&s;&s;ence</HI> of virtue and vice lies in their <HI>nature,</HI> is only &s;aying, that the nature of them con&s;i&s;ts in their nature. Or the propo&s;ition might be tran&s;po&s;ed thus: The <HI>nature</HI> of virtue and vice lies in their <HI>e&s;&s;ence.</HI> The word nature needs explaining as much as the word e&s;&s;ence. To u&s;e the former as a definition or ex|planation of the latter, wou'd not be le&s;s trifling than to attempt to explain the term <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> by the words <HI>mu&s;t, can, cannot,</HI> of which Mr. Edwards takes notice. (P. 18.) We don't advance one &s;tep in our under&s;tanding of the &s;ubject by &s;uch explanations. Shou'd any one a&s;k, where|in doth the e&s;&s;ence of virtue and vice con&s;i&s;t? and receive
<PB N="75" REF="012746_0072_0F9090E9B388DF00">
for an&s;wer, It con&s;i&s;ts in it's nature&mdash;wou'd he think the an&s;wer le&s;s impertinent, or be le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to laugh at him that offers it, than if upon a&s;king an explanation of the word nece&s;&s;ity, he &s;hou'd be an&s;wered, that which is nece&s;|&s;ary, mu&s;t and cannot but be?</P>
<P>We de&s;ire no logical proof that the nature of virtue and vice lie in the nature of a virtuous or vicious di&s;po&s;i|tion. We allow that &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition is <HI>what it is;</HI> and think there was no occa&s;ion to fill the page with proofs of this &s;ort. For who is fool enough to di&s;pute the thing! But doth this &s;how us what <HI>con&s;titutes</HI> the nature of virtue and vice? what it is that <HI>makes</HI> any particular action or di&s;po&s;ition virtuous or vicious? Or doth it follow, from admitting that <Q>the nature of vertue and vice lies in their nature,</Q> that therefore their nature is <HI>&s;eperable</HI> from their <HI>cau&s;e?</HI> or that one can be judged of <HI>detach'd</HI> from the o|ther? Were vertue and vice, as effects in the natural world, produc'd by the efficiency of &s;ome cau&s;e extrin&s;ic to the &s;ubject, and in which he is but a pa&s;&s;ive recipient, then, indeed, we might detach their cau&s;e from their nature. But this is beging the que&s;tion. It &s;till remains to be proved, that vertue and vice in rational agents are the pro|duction of a cau&s;e extrin&s;ic to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This di&s;tinction of Mr. Edwards's is, therefore, &s;ubtil and eva&s;ive, as it carries in it an intimation, that his op|ponents deny the e&s;&s;ence of volition to lie in it's nature, and maintain it lies in it's cau&s;e by way of di&s;tinction from it's nature. But when or where have they affirm'd the lat|ter, or deny'd the former? Again, this di&s;tinction is eva&s;ive, ina&s;much as it takes for granted, that if the e&s;&s;ence of voli|tion lies in it's nature, then the nature of volition may be &s;eperated from the cau&s;e&mdash;which con&s;equence is by no means admitted. It is eva&s;ive al&s;o, as it takes for granted that the cau&s;e of moral volitions is not in the mind of mo|ral agents. For if it be indeed true, that the cau&s;e of &s;uch volition is in the mind or agent willing, we pre&s;ume, in this ca&s;e, no one wou'd attempt to disjoin the cau&s;e and nature of volition. Lea&s;t of all could Mr. Edwards.</P>
<P>To treat of moral cau&s;es and effects in the &s;ame manner as a philo&s;opher wou'd di&s;cour&s;e on natural cau&s;es, is a
<PB N="76" REF="012746_0073_0F9090EA412D29A8">
method of handling moral &s;ubjects altogether improper, but much u&s;ed by Mr. Edwards&mdash;With what advantage to his own &s;cheme? For in <HI>this</HI> way of rea&s;oning we a&s;|cend from the effect to the cau&s;e. <Q>The cau&s;e mu&s;t be proportionable and agreable to the effect, nor can there be more in the effect than in the cau&s;e,</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 62.</NOTE> as Mr. Ed|wards hath ob&s;erved. Admit then that vertue and vice in moral and accountable creatures are the production of a cau&s;e extrin&s;ic to their own minds, have we not &s;hewn, that the cau&s;e which produceth wickedne&s;s, is wicked? The &s;ubject in whom vice is thus produced cannot be vi|cious at all. Or to &s;peak more properly, the &s;uppo&s;ition that a creature can, in this way, be the &s;ubject of a vicious di&s;po&s;ition, is a palpable ab&s;urdity. A di&s;po&s;ition thus produced cannot partake of the nature of vice, viewed in relation to the <HI>&s;ubject,</HI> however it doth as view'd in relation to the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> and <HI>producer</HI> of it. If then this cau&s;e be God, (as on Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme we have &s;hewn it mu&s;t be) who wou'd not &s;hudder at the con&s;equence!</P>
<P>That the nature of moral evil cannot be detached from it's efficient cau&s;e, we pre&s;ume will clearly appear from &s;tating a few ca&s;es. And &s;ince it is the <HI>origin</HI> of evil we are ultimately enquiring after, the&s;e ca&s;es &s;hall be &s;tated upon the different &s;chemes of accounting for the introduc|tion of moral evil, which have been embraced by divines and philo&s;ophers. The fir&s;t &s;hall be Mr. Edwards's own.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then the exi&s;tence of &s;in aro&s;e from the <HI>imper|fection</HI> properly belonging to a creature, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> and from God's withholding or <HI>withdrawing</HI> his grace. On this plan can the fir&s;t &s;in of angels and man be disjoined from the cau&s;e? If the creature had not original abilities and communications from God adequate to the duty requir'd of him; or if the&s;e abilities and communications were &s;u&s;|pended or withdrawn before any forfeiture was incur'd; cou'd the moral evil of that di&s;po&s;ition, which the fir&s;t &s;in involved, be attributed to the &s;ubject of it, any more than if he had been created with it? Or any more than if it had been infu&s;ed by the po&s;itive influence of &s;ome other agent? Mr. Edwards wou'd admit, that if a moral agent was
<PB N="77" REF="012746_0074_0F9090EB00396B38">
"fir&s;t made with a fountain of evil in his heart," or had a vicious di&s;po&s;ition afterwards produced in him by the efficiency of the Deity, this wou'd be to make God the actor and doer of wickedne&s;s. Now hath it not been &s;hewn, that his own &s;cheme runs up to this? Doth it not, therefore, follow, even on his own doctrine, in the ca&s;e we are now &s;uppo&s;ing that the obliquity of &s;in cannot be &s;eperated from the cau&s;e&mdash;though (&s;hocking to mention!) he makes the Deity him&s;elf that cau&s;e? Doth this &s;cheme give us an idea of the moral governor of the world at all different from what the &s;criptures give us of the arbitrary prince of Egypt in the time of Mo&s;es, who demanded of the I&s;raelites the u&s;ual tale of brick, after he deny'd them &s;traw? Or of tho&s;e who <HI>bound heavy burthens, and grie|vous to be born, and laid them on mens &s;houlders, but them|&s;elves wou'd not move them with one of their fingers?</HI> Should a ma&s;ter require of his &s;ervant &s;uch a ta&s;k as he cou'd well perform, having proper tools to work with&mdash;but ne|ver allow him &s;uch tools, or for no fault of the &s;ervant's take them from him, &s;o that he <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> fails of the per|formance of his ta&s;k: Wou'd any body pronounce &s;uch &s;ervant wicked and &s;lothful&mdash;accu&s;e him of idlene&s;s and want of re&s;pect to his ma&s;ter? Wou'd not every one pity him as having an hard, and unrea&s;onable ma&s;ter, and attribute all the blame to the latter for denying his &s;ervant what was requi&s;ite to his performing the ta&s;k required? But is there &s;uch unrighteou&s;ne&s;s with God? There are, indeed, but a very few divines of eminence, if any, who account for the exi&s;tence of &s;in in this way which Mr. Edwards doth.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e in the next place, that the <HI>po&s;itive agency and efficiency</HI> of God was the cau&s;e of &s;in's fir&s;t enterance into the world. Can we disjoin the nature of &s;in from the cau&s;e, in this ca&s;e, and in this &s;uppo&s;ition? Wou'd not this be to make the creature an&s;werable for the act of God? Are moral agents only the &s;ubjects of certain effects from divine agency? Wherein then do they differ from ma|chines? And if there is no material difference, wherein con|&s;i&s;ts the moral evil of any di&s;po&s;itions in them? But what an horrid impeachment of the mo&s;t High doth this doctrine
<PB N="78" REF="012746_0075_0F90913BF5778BB8">
contain? This is, indeed, the clear con&s;equence of Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme, though he cho&s;e not to affirm it in words. 'Tis more directly to arraign the perfections and government of almighty God: And hence many, who have thought favourably of Mr. Edwards's doctrine, re|ject this with pious indignation; and did they &s;uppo&s;e his doctrine was reducible to &s;uch a con&s;equence, wou'd im|mediately give it up. But as this a&s;cription of the fir&s;t &s;in, of all &s;in, to the influence, energy, agency or efficiency of God, differs nothing e&s;&s;entially from the next ca&s;e we &s;hall &s;tate, we will proceed directly to</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e moral agents <HI>created</HI> with vicious di&s;po&s;itions&mdash;Suppo&s;e a creature formed with the temper of Lucifer&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e he him&s;elf had been created with his pre&s;ent tem|per. Such a temper is, <HI>in it's own nature,</HI> exceeding odi|ous. But cou'd it be &s;o e&s;teem'd &s;eperate from the <HI>cre|ating cau&s;e?</HI> Wou'd it &s;atisfy any rational man to be told in this ca&s;e, that the <HI>having</HI> &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition argu'd the high criminality of the &s;ubject of it, without our being o|bliged <Q>at all to con&s;ider <HI>how he came to have it</HI>&mdash;that let him come by it how he will, he is fully and perfectly free in exerci&s;ing of it, and therefore de&s;erving of blame and puni&s;hment.</Q> Wou'd not this be to make the crea|ture culpable for the con&s;titution and temper he receiv'd immediately from the forming hands of the Creator? Might we not as ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;e it, a culpable thing in any human being that he is not formed with the capacity of Gabriel? or in ideots, that they have not natural under&s;tanding? or in brutes, that they are not endowed with rea&s;on? Can the thing formed be an&s;werable for the act of the former of it? What is properly God's con&s;titution cannot be the &s;in of the creature. Con&s;equently, in the ca&s;e now put, the <HI>having</HI> the malignant di&s;po&s;ition &s;uppo&s;ed, would not infer criminality in the &s;ubject, however dete&s;table &s;uch di&s;po&s;ition is in it&s;elf: But the criminality, if any there be, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the immediate <HI>author and efficient</HI> of it&mdash;that is, to the creating <HI>cau&s;e.</HI> Nor is the &s;uppo&s;iti|on of a creature made at fir&s;t with &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition ma|terially different from Mr. Edwards's opinion concerning the introduction of &s;in, view'd in it's natural con&s;equence; as we tru&s;t hath already been proved.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="012746_0076_0F90913FACC83BC0">Whether, therefore, we &s;uppo&s;e that &s;in aro&s;e from the want or withdraw of divine influence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or from divine agency and efficiency, or that creatures were made wicked at fir&s;t, the nature of &s;in cannot be &s;eperated from it's cau&s;e. Now except the&s;e opinions concerning the origin of evil, there has been no other that de&s;erves to be mentioned but that maintain'd by the generality of morali&s;ts and divines, that it aro&s;e from the abu&s;e of free-will&mdash;in other words, from a cau&s;e in moral agents them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Before we di&s;mi&s;s the in&s;tances above adduced, we wou'd &s;ubjoin this further ob&s;ervation, that if <HI>that</HI> energy be an <HI>holy</HI> energy, which angels and &s;aints are the &s;ubjects of, then that is a <HI>&s;inful</HI> energy, which devils and wicked men are the &s;ubjects of, or <HI>thro' which</HI> their wills are inclined and determined to vice&mdash;That if one moral agent (whether creature or creator) is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the po&s;itive cau&s;e of &s;in in another, &s;o much &s;in as is to be attributed to the efficiency of the former, is to be taken from the crimina|lity of the latter, and &s;et to the account of the cau&s;e and producer of it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quod e&s;t cau&s;a cau&s;ae, e&s;t etiam cau&s;a cau&s;ati.</NOTE></P>
<P>We go on to ob&s;erve, that as moral agency involves accountablene&s;s to a moral governor, &s;o the laws of God have re&s;pect to the <HI>inward</HI> and <HI>outward</HI> man. They re|quire not only &s;uch inward principles and affections as corre&s;pond to his perfections and gifts to us, and the rela|tions we &s;tand in to our fellow-creatures; but al&s;o exter|nal acts of devotion, ju&s;tice, charity, &s;elf-government. The matter and &s;ub&s;tance of morality and religion are as much the &s;ubject of command, as the internal principles and af|fections of heart, which &s;hou'd regulate and influence to 'em. Now the nature of an external action is the &s;ame, whether perform'd by a good or bad man. The prayers and alms of a Phari&s;ee, in them&s;elves con&s;idered, or as to the matter of them, are as commendable as tho&s;e of the mo&s;t approved Chri&s;tians. Mr. Edwards in&s;i&s;ts, that moral good or evil lies in the &s;tate and di&s;po&s;ition of the mind, and allows of no vertue or vice in external actions, detach'd from their cau&s;e&mdash;the principles they proceed from, the ends aim'd at. But why are <HI>internal exerci&s;es</HI> then disjoined from their cau&s;e? It is as evident a truth, that <HI>material actions</HI> are good
<PB N="80" REF="012746_0077_0F90914128E60820">
or bad in their own nature, as that the inward principles and affections are &s;o. External acts are what they are in their own nature, not depending on the &s;entiments and vo|litions of the agent. Though in a <HI>relative</HI> view and e&s;ti|mation they vary, according to the temper, circum&s;tances and advantages of the agent; yet their nature is unaltera|ble. Men's doing things in their own nature right, with an evil intent; or doing things in their own nature very evil, meaning to do God &s;ervice, doth not alter the nature of the things done. Therefore let us connect both internal exerci&s;es and external actions with their cau&s;es, or neither.</P>
<P>Again, The &s;ame &s;in may be very differently <HI>aggravated</HI> in different per&s;ons, or in the &s;ame per&s;on at different times. But any &s;in is in it's own nature the &s;ame, by what|ever moral agent committed, or however circum&s;tanced. The preci&s;e definition of &s;in is A NOMIA&mdash;i. e. without law, or a non-conformity to law. But to determine the degree of guilt in regard to any particular &s;in, be&s;ides the general con&s;ideration of the <HI>nature</HI> of the vicious affection or act, the <HI>advantages, opportunities</HI> and <HI>circum&s;tances</HI> of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or mu&s;t al&s;o come into con&s;ideration. Moral writers have ever kept up this di&s;tinction. Be&s;ides maintain|ing that &s;ome crimes are more heinous than others view'd in their own nature, they have al&s;o maintain'd, that <Q>&s;ome are more heinous than others <HI>by rea&s;on of &s;everal aggra|vations.</HI></Q> The &s;ame &s;in admits of a variety of circum|&s;tances, which either aggravate or extenuate the guilt of it: The&s;e di&s;tinctions are carefully pre&s;erved in the &s;acred writings. Now the particular <HI>aggravation</HI> and <HI>circum&s;tan|ces</HI> of crimes are as different from their <HI>nature,</HI> as one &s;in is different from another&mdash;(as different as bla&s;phemy is from &s;ome idle word men may &s;peak) and therefore ought to come under a &s;eperate con&s;ideration. But Mr. Edwards's doctrine precludes this plain and important di&s;tinction. For if the &s;eperate con&s;ideration of the nature of any vici|ous volition in it&s;elf be all that is nece&s;&s;ary to determine the matter of criminality, then the fame crime mu&s;t be e|qually heinous in every per&s;on that commits it, and in the &s;ame per&s;on at all times. Difference of circum&s;tances can have no weight, as they do not belong to the nature of any particular vice&mdash;they only make a <HI>gradual,</HI> not a <HI>&s;pecific</HI> dif|ference.
<PB N="81" REF="012746_0078_0F90914141D986A8">
But the former, it &s;eems, is of no e&s;timation. In other words, there is nothing that can either heighten or extenuate the <HI>&s;ame</HI> tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Suppo&s;e the wills of moral agents are derived from the author of nature, (which by implication was Mr. Edwards's doctrine) and we might apply to the general &s;ubject of this &s;ection &s;uch in&s;tances as the following. A good man is, by the act of divine providence; reduced to a &s;tate of in&s;anity&mdash;in con&s;equence of which he is full of the mo&s;t implacable hatred, malice and malignity again&s;t his neare&s;t kindred and be&s;t friends&mdash;yea, bla&s;phemeth his Maker. This di&s;|po&s;ition is in it's own nature exceeding vile. But is it to be &s;o con|&s;idered in him? It is, on Mr. Edwards's principles. His <HI>having</HI> and <HI>indulging</HI> the aforementioned malignity of temper, his <HI>voluntarily</HI> uttering bla&s;phemy, are enough to prove him a malignant per&s;on, and a bla&s;phmer, without con&s;idering at all <HI>how he came</HI> by &s;uch a di&s;po|&s;ition&mdash;whether it proceeded from a cau&s;e extrin&s;ic or intrin&s;ic. For the madman may proceed as <HI>acliberately, voluntarily</HI> and <HI>de&s;ignedly</HI> in the&s;e things, as one who hath the u&s;e of rea&s;on. In the abovenamed in&s;tances "he doth wrong, and doth &s;o from his heart." And what more is wanting to con&s;titute him a mo&s;t vile and abandon'd &s;inner? nothing&mdash;except that his &s;entiments and di&s;po&s;ition are not under his own command, during the dolirium. His will is, indeed fully in the&s;e things&mdash;His internal exerci&s;es are voluntary&mdash;his external actions are &s;pontaneous exertions&mdash;he acts lei&s;urely, according to the pre&s;ent di&s;|po&s;ition of his heart&mdash;he is under no other nece&s;&s;ity than what is his will's pre&s;ent propen&s;ity. But then he is incapable of directing and governing his own volitions and actions&mdash;therefore not the cau&s;e of them&mdash;therefore not blameable</P>
<P>On the &s;ame principle, that agents are blameable for any particular di&s;po&s;ition interwoven with their original frame, we might argue, that the brute-creatures are vicious. The fiercene&s;s of the tyger, the ravening di&s;po&s;ition of the bear and wolf, the venom of the &s;erpent, might be adduced as examples of a di&s;po&s;ition mo&s;t odious in it's own nature: There is no oppo&s;ition in their wills to it&mdash;they exer|ci&s;e it freely&mdash;'tis their nature.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The foregoing ob&s;ervations may be &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that commendation or blame is not to be &s;eperated from the cau&s;e of a virtuous or vicious di&s;po&s;ition, and to expo&s;e the weakne&s;s of that di&s;tinction of Mr. Edwards's, on which we have been remarking. It is at lea&s;t true with re&s;pect to the origin of evil, that it's nature cannot be &s;e|perated from it's cau&s;e, nor even in idea conceived to be &s;o.</P>
<P>Having examined the merits of the di&s;tinction it&s;elf, we promi&s;ed, in the next place, to remind the reader, that however futile and eva&s;ive it really is, yet on Mr. Ed|wards's <HI>plan,</HI> and <HI>in his</HI> view, it was of much <HI>importance.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e he had of it's importance appears from what he has wrote on this point&mdash;particularly Part IV. Sect. 1.
<PB N="82" REF="012746_0079_0F9091426AA08190">
Nor did he mi&s;-judge, provided this fundamental principle in his &s;cheme be true, that moral agents do not originate, in any ca&s;e, their own actions&mdash;in other words, provided the cau&s;e of their actions be not in them&s;elves. For on this principle, one or other of the&s;e things mu&s;t follow&mdash;either that vertue or vice is not predicable of moral agents, or that the e&s;&s;ence of them depends not on their cau&s;e. The fir&s;t Mr. Edwards wou'd by no means admit; the other he &s;aw was a plain con&s;equence of his principles. He therefore &s;et him&s;elf to defend it as well as he could, that he might exempt the Deity from the charge of being criminal, while, by &s;uppo&s;ition, he originates the volitions of his intelligent creatures.</P>
<P>Hence appears the occa&s;ion Mr. Edwards had to &s;epe|rate the nature of vertue and vice from their cau&s;e. This is very much a turning point in the controver&s;y on liberty and nece&s;&s;ity, as he hath &s;tated it. Whether the di&s;tinc|tion can be vindicated as ju&s;t and proper, we leave the reader to judge. If it cannot, one or other of the&s;e con|&s;equences mu&s;t follow&mdash;either fir&s;t, that there is no &s;in in the world&mdash;or &s;econdly, that God him&s;elf is the only cri|minal being&mdash;or thirdly, that the cau&s;e of &s;in is in the mind of the &s;inner. Either of the three &s;ubverts Mr. Ed|wards's &s;cheme. The la&s;t is the only eligible opinion.</P>
<P>Mr. Edwards's &s;ubject naturally led him to be explicit on this que&s;tion, Whether God or the creature be the pro|per cau&s;e of moral evil? It mu&s;t have been full in his view while writing every part of his book. But we don't recollect that he has once &s;aid, or &s;o much as hinted, that the creature is the efficient cau&s;e of &s;in; though he hath &s;aid many things which imply that God is the efficient. Whether he declined being explicit from a conviction, that though his &s;cheme made God the cau&s;e of moral tur|pitude, the minds of Chri&s;tians were not yet prepared to receive this a&s;toni&s;hing doctrine, we &s;hall not &s;ay. It is of va&s;t importance, who is the cau&s;e of &s;in. We could wi&s;h Mr. Edwards had not evaded a direct an&s;wer to a que&s;tion, which his &s;ubject, in every part of it, required him to an&s;wer in <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>determinate</HI> language.</P>

It would be no difficult matter to &s;hew, that the latter a&s;&s;ertion is as <HI>daring</HI> as the former, altho' Mr. Edwards has "ventured" to affirm the one, and to impeach the goodne&s;s of their under&s;tanding who may affirm the other, or chu&s;e not to expre&s;s them&s;elves with the a&s;&s;urance he doth. Whether it argues "good under|&s;tanding," or prejudice and confidence, that he is &s;o <Q>ex|ceeding peremtory in this opinion (as he is in every opi|nion which he maintains in this controver&s;y with the</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 108.</NOTE> deniers of nece&s;&s;ity) we leave to others to judge.</P>
<P>To one that enquires, "Why did God permit &s;in?" it would be a proper an&s;wer, You have no right to know: 'Tis &s;ufficient that he is not the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of it. The rea&s;ons and ends of the permi&s;&s;ion of &s;in, as well as of other events, the Father hath re&s;erved very much in his own power. 'Tis not for us to know them. Whatever the con&s;equences of &s;in are, or might have been, had no redeemer been pro|vided, God and his throne will be guiltle&s;s, if the fall of angels and men is laid at the right door. Our duty is to ble&s;s God who hath not permitted the human apo&s;tacy without the provi&s;ion of an all-&s;ufficient &s;avior, in whom who&s;oever believeth &s;hall not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting

life&mdash;who hath made us partakers of his go&s;pel and grace in Chri&s;t; and to give a practical a&s;&s;ent to this faithful &s;aying, that Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the world to &s;ave &s;in|ners. For thus only can we be &s;aved from the wages of &s;in, and become the &s;ubjects of that grace which reigneth through righteou&s;ne&s;s unto eternal life, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion re&s;pecting the rea&s;ons of the divine permi&s;|&s;ion of &s;in, being u&s;ele&s;s and impertinent at lea&s;t, if not pre&s;umptuous, we would only take occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that "it is the inevitable re&s;ult of the nature and condition of created free agents, that they may po&s;&s;ibly err, and act contrary to right; and the placing them in &s;uch a po&s;&s;ibi|lity is by no means to be imputed to any deficiency of wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s in God. For example, &s;uch a crea|ture as man, compounded of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, mu&s;t have a variety of affections; &s;ome higher, and &s;ome lower; &s;ome which determine him to pur&s;ue the proper perfection of his &s;uperior faculties as the chief end of his being, and o|thers which attach him to the inferior part of his con&s;ti|tution; which mu&s;t al&s;o be pre&s;erved by his care, during the time appointed for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Since then, there are &s;uch different tendencies in the nature of man, and liberty al&s;o e&s;&s;ential to him, he mu&s;t be capable of acting differently according to the different direction of his in|&s;tincts and affections; and his acting always right could not be ab&s;olutely &s;ecured, or the po&s;&s;ibility of moral evil avoided, without &s;uch an interpo&s;ition of almighty power, as would import an e&s;&s;ential change in his frame and his &s;tate. In other words, if the divine perfections required that &s;in &s;hould be ab&s;olutely prevented, or not at all per|mitted, they required that &s;uch a creature as man in a &s;tate of probation, &s;hould not be created: Which &s;carcely any con&s;iderate per&s;on will have the hardine&s;s to affirm." <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Abernethy.</NOTE></P>
<P>Mr. Edwards, it will be remembered, proceeds upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, that the infinite creator, before the world was, having in contemplation all po&s;&s;ible &s;y&s;tems, gave the preference to one including moral evil, as be&s;t calculated to manife&s;t his perfections. Hence he affirms it to be
<PB N="85" REF="012746_0082_0F9091444182F298">
part of God's own infinite &s;cheme of things to <HI>chu&s;e</HI> what he <HI>hates,</HI> and what is in it&s;elf, as man's act, di&s;agreable to his heart. (p. 380.) He accordingly in&s;tructs us to view the world, with all the wickedne&s;s that ever was, is, or will be in it, as the projection, ordination and production of that glorious being, who hath not plea&s;ure in wicked|ne&s;s, with whom evil &s;hall not dwell. Nothing has ever taken place but in pro&s;ecution of his original plan: Mo|ral evil is a nece&s;&s;ary means through which he effects his de&s;igns: and (it is intimated p. 163,) hath not "mar'd his &s;y&s;tem,"&mdash;nor indeed can this be &s;uppo&s;ed, if &s;in is &s;o e&s;&s;ential and material "a part of his infinite &s;cheme of things."</P>
<P>Now were it admitted, that moral evil is for the be&s;t, as Mr. Edwards declares <HI>he is certain it is;</HI> this would by no means be a bottom broad enough to &s;upport his doc|trine; that it came into exi&s;tence through the divine de|termination and deci&s;ive di&s;po&s;al. For if he "di&s;po&s;eth the mind to" moral evil, then he "<HI>cau&s;eth</HI> the mind to be di&s;|po&s;ed to, and to will" it; "and that is the &s;ame thing as to be the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of" moral evil (p. 136.) Again, Mr. Ed|wards in&s;i&s;ts, that the <HI>determiner</HI> of volition is the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of it. So that to &s;ay (as he does through his whole book) that God determineth every volition of moral agents from their fir&s;t exi&s;tence; is to &s;ay, he is the cau&s;e of every &s;inful volition. But enough has been offered on this head. The opinion, that moral evil is for the be&s;t, is much more ten|able on the principles of tho&s;e who a&s;cribe cau&s;ality and &s;elf-determination to the creature, and &s;uppo&s;e &s;in aro&s;e from the abu&s;e of free-will, maintaining no influence or di&s;po&s;al of the divine being in it, but only his <HI>permi&s;&s;ion</HI> of it, or <HI>&s;uffering</HI> it to come to pa&s;s&mdash;than on the principles of tho&s;e who a&s;cribe moral evil to his <HI>efficiency.</HI> The for|mer opinion &s;hews a re&s;pect to the moral character of God: The advocates for it &s;ay, he taketh occa&s;ion to bring good out of evil&mdash;to over-rule the exi&s;tence of &s;in for the be&s;t. The e&s;pou&s;ers of the latter opinion &s;eem boldly to &s;ay, that God doth evil, that good may come. Can a being of perfect moral excellence give exi&s;tence to &s;in by his influ|ence? Can it be faulty in the &s;ubject, and yet proceed from
<PB N="86" REF="012746_0083_0F909145C02DBEF0">
him as the cau&s;e? We pre&s;ume it has been made evi|dent, that neither of the&s;e things can be true.</P>
<P>The &s;cheme under examination &s;uppo&s;eth God to be the cau&s;e of every thing, and con&s;equently of &s;in&mdash;hence &s;in is infered to be be&s;t, becau&s;e it is &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from God in this manner. Were moral agents left to de|termine them&s;elves, then it is pleaded, the events depend|ing on their determination would be contingent, and might not come to pa&s;s; which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be irreconcileable with the pre&s;cience and decrees of God&mdash;the plan of his government. Moral evil being part of his plan, to render it's exi&s;tence <HI>certain,</HI> he determined, it is &s;aid, to <HI>effect</HI> it by his providence&mdash;by his own <HI>power and agency;</HI> as much as he determined to create the world by an exertion of his power. The difficulty from divine pre&s;cience &s;hall be examined in it's place. But if the above mentioned foun|dation be fal&s;e, the inference, that &s;in is for the be&s;t cannot be &s;upported by it, even granting the thing infered to be true in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>On his principles Mr. Edwards (with good rea&s;on) &s;up|po&s;ed it would be objected, that God may do evil that good may come. But how hath his an&s;wer removed the objection, if it be indeed true, as he teacheth, that moral evil is a part of God's infinite &s;cheme&mdash;an effect of his determining and di&s;po&s;ing&mdash;and therefore be&s;t? If &s;o, is it unfit and un&s;uitable in it's nature, or of bad tendency? Can that be a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary means</HI> of the greate&s;t good in the divine &s;y&s;tem, which is upon the whole either unfit and un&s;uitable in it's nature, or bad in it's tendency? In order to accompli&s;h his own holy and benevolent ends, is infi|nite wi&s;dom compelled to make u&s;e of unholy and male|volent means? means unfit and un&s;uitable in their nature, and in their tendency bad? How can &s;uch things &s;tand in the relation of means to the propo&s;ed end? Mr. Edwards mu&s;t either &s;ay, that God doth evil that good may come, or el&s;e that moral evil is a thing fit in it's nature, and good in it's tendency. For to be the cau&s;e of an evil effect is evidently to do evil; and though &s;uch evil be improved as a means of great general good, the end will not &s;anctify or alter the means. No being can, with a good intent,
<PB N="87" REF="012746_0084_0F90914688624550">
be the de&s;igned cau&s;e of moral evil. Yet it is in&s;i&s;ted on, that moral evil is determined and de&s;igned by God&mdash;"a part of his own infinite &s;cheme." And if it is his deter|mining act, then he is the cau&s;e of it. Plain common &s;en&s;e, unperverted by metaphy&s;ics, teacheth the world, that holy means only are <HI>adapted</HI> to an holy end; and that no &s;up|po&s;eable reference of moral evil to a good end can ju&s;tify any moral agent in having recour&s;e to it to effect his de|&s;igns&mdash;much le&s;s can a being of infinite perfection, who can be at no lo&s;s for proper means to accompli&s;h his own ends, fir&s;t be the cau&s;e of wickedne&s;s, that by this, as a ne|ce&s;&s;ary means, he may bring to pa&s;s the purpo&s;es of his holine&s;s and goodne&s;s. The nature of the means will be the &s;ame, whatever be the end in view. After all the &s;o|phi&s;tical pains that have been taken to &s;hew, that moral evil, though infinitely hateful in it's nature and tendency, is yet a nece&s;&s;ary well-adapted means of the greate&s;t good, and as &s;uch fir&s;t effected by the deity, and then improved by him to advance the greate&s;t happine&s;s in his &s;y&s;tem, it yet remains problematical, or far from being proved that un&s;potted purity can be the author of &s;in. If we &s;hould grant it to be be&s;t that moral evil hath come into exi&s;tence, will it therefore follow, that it is an effect proceeding from divine efficiency? or that it is be&s;t the &s;upreme cau&s;e &s;hou'd be the <HI>author</HI> of it? "They who think and talk in this &s;train <HI>ought to remember,</HI>" that they have no rea&s;on to complain, if the world e&s;teem it "an in&s;tance of the greate&s;t arrogance" and audacious impiety.</P>
<P>"Though the actual permi&s;&s;ion of evil," &s;ays bi&s;hop Butler, <Q>may be beneficial to the world: (that is, it would have been more mi&s;chievous, not that a wicked per&s;on had <HI>him&s;elf</HI> ab&s;tained from his own wickedne&s;s, <HI>but that any one had forcibly prevented it,</HI> than that it was permitted:) Yet notwith&s;tanding, it might have been much better for the world, if this very evil had never been done. Nay, it is mo&s;t clearly conceivable, that the very com|mi&s;&s;ion of wickedne&s;s may be beneficial to the world, and yet, that it would be infinitely more beneficial for men to refrain from it. For thus, in the wi&s;e and good con&s;titution of the natural world, there are di&s;orders

which bring their own cures; di&s;ea&s;es, which are them|&s;elves remedies. Many a man would have died, had it not been for the gout or a fever; yet it would be tho't madne&s;s to a&s;&s;ert, that &s;ickne&s;s is a better or a more per|fect &s;tate than health; though the like, with regard to the moral world, has been a&s;&s;erted.</Q></P>
<P>With mo&s;t Chri&s;tians it might be laid down for a <HI>po&s;tulatum,</HI> that the knowledge, imitation and enjoyment of God were his end in the formation of moral and ac|countable, creatures. Whence it will follow, that the greate&s;t good of the intelligent creation is to fall in with that in&s;truction in the oracles of truth; (contrary to ma|ny in modern metaphy&s;ics) <HI>Let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he under&s;tandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord, which exerci&s;e loving-kindne&s;s, judgment and righteou&s;|ne&s;s in the earth: For in the&s;e things I delight, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> This clearly points out the Creator's view and de&s;ign in giving being to moral agents&mdash;what <HI>his</HI> own &s;cheme is&mdash;what &s;hould be <HI>their</HI> fir&s;t and la&s;t end, and re|garded by them as the one thing needful&mdash;&s;hewing them how they may fall in with the de&s;igns and exertions of in|finite wi&s;dom for the advancement of their holine&s;s and highe&s;t happine&s;s, and thereby attain the end of their cre|ation. To live without remembrance or knowledge of God, in contradiction to the above mentioned moral per|fections, which he di&s;plays in his own government of the world, and propounds to the imitation of the &s;ubjects of his moral government&mdash;to &s;in again&s;t him without fear&mdash; we need not &s;cruple to &s;ay, this would be to oppo&s;e his de&s;igns. If his end in the creation of moral agents was, that they might be conformed to him and ble&s;&s;ed in his likene&s;s and friend&s;hip; <HI>perhaps</HI> it may be infered, that he had no &s;ecret de&s;ign contrary to this. <HI>Perhaps</HI> it may follow, that he did not make rebel angels at fir&s;t with this view, that he might be the cau&s;e of their rebellion, and then puni&s;h them eternally for what was the effect of his own determining act, as a means of di&s;playing his holine&s;s and ju&s;tice and mercy, of e&s;tabli&s;hing his dominion and authority, of promoting and &s;ecuring the moral rectitude of their fellows.

<P>From what has been ob&s;erved, it follows, that moral evil was not God's end in the creation of moral agents; and con&s;equently, that it was not part of his &s;cheme to bring them to the enjoyment of him&s;elf, or &s;ecure to them this felicity, by means of moral evil. They who &s;ay &s;o ought to prove the&s;e two things. Fir&s;t, That moral evil is a nece&s;&s;ary means of qualifying moral agents for the enjoyment of God, or of their everla&s;ting &s;ecurity of his friend&s;hip. Secondly, That he hath pre&s;cribed it as the true medium to this end, and determined it's exi&s;tence with this view. In other words, that &s;in is the appointed me|dium of holine&s;s and happine&s;s&mdash;nece&s;&s;ary to the moral perfection of the intelligent creation. We are too &s;en&s;ible what &s;ort of employment he mu&s;t have who undertakes this, to &s;pend time in expo&s;ing the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch a &s;cheme.</P>
<P>That holine&s;s is the greate&s;t good of the moral world, we beg leave to take for granted. We don't de&s;ire to maintain a controver&s;y with tho&s;e who deny it. This prin|ciple being admitted, the enquiry is, what hath the di|recte&s;t tendency to promote holine&s;s? For that is for the be&s;t, which hath this tendency. Now we may appeal to common &s;en&s;e, whether moral evil is mo&s;t eligible in this view. Whether that which &s;tands in direct oppo&s;ition to holine&s;s hath the mo&s;t direct tendency to it, or conduceth to the highe&s;t degrees of it. Do contraries promote and advance each other? Is greater happine&s;s attained by a partial remedy of an evil, than would be by preventing it? Which is mo&s;t honorable to the infinite Creator, to &s;ay, that the original powers and a&s;&s;i&s;tances imparted to the creature were &s;ufficient to his continuing upright, and that his fall aro&s;e from the abu&s;e of them? Or to &s;ay, that his fall aro&s;e from a defect of original advantages, or the withdraw of divine influence?</P>
<P>Natural evil appears plainly to be the con&s;equence of moral, and not moral the con&s;equence of natural, as a late

<P>Mr. Edwards &s;uppo&s;eth, that all events which <HI>have taken place</HI> may <HI>therefore</HI> be inferred to be agreable to infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s and part of the &s;cheme of the &s;uperin|tendent of the univer&s;e&mdash;and that all events which <HI>ever will take place</HI> fall within his plan and de&s;ign, for the &s;ame rea&s;on. Whence it follows, that what&s;oever <HI>hath not,</HI> or <HI>will not come to pa&s;s,</HI> is di&s;agreable to him, contrary to his &s;cheme of government. For were it agreable to his wi&s;|dom and goodne&s;s, he would chu&s;e it; and if he cho&s;e, he would determine it; and if he determined it, he would bring it to pa&s;s. Con&s;equently, he chu&s;eth and de&s;ireth not the repentance of &s;uch as die impenitent. For this would be to chu&s;e &s;omething in contravention of his infinite &s;cheme. Con&s;equently, he hath not commanded them to repent; or if he hath, then he hath commanded what is not a|greable to his wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s. Or if his de&s;ire is expre&s;&s;ed in his commands, then the thing de&s;ired not taking place; he mu&s;t be infinitely cro&s;&s;ed and grieved, in proportion to his infinite love and de&s;ire of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and hatred of wickedne&s;s. For this is Mr. Ed|wards's own inference, if any thing is &s;uppo&s;ed to come to pa&s;s which God chu&s;eth and de&s;ireth not&mdash;or fails of com|ing to pa&s;s which he chu&s;eth &s;hould come to pa&s;s.

of his goodne&s;s and forbearance, in the day of vi&s;itation, not de&s;igned to lead them to repentance? Is it not que&s;|tionable, upon the whole, whether he is a lover of holine&s;s? For how much would the renovation of impenitents add to the &s;um total of holine&s;s in the univer&s;e? But this is not a thing cho&s;en and de&s;ired, <HI>becau&s;e it doth not come to pa&s;s</HI>&mdash;and for this <HI>good</HI> rea&s;on it would not be be&s;t. Or will any undertake to &s;hew, that the impenitency of great multitudes is a means of proportionably more holine&s;s in other beings&mdash;that the holine&s;s of a &s;mall number com|paratively is &s;o amazingly increa&s;ed <HI>by this means,</HI> that the amount of holine&s;s and happine&s;s in the &s;y&s;tem will be great|er, than if all abandoned &s;inners had been led to repentance? greater than if all created free-agents had continu'd holy? Or admit this, the con&s;equence then is, that the impeni|tent wickedne&s;s and eternal puni&s;hment of the greate&s;t part of the intelligent creation is a nece&s;&s;ary means, thro' which the governor of the world effects the ends of holi|ne&s;s and goodne&s;s with re&s;pect to a remnant that &s;hall be &s;aved. But it yet remains to be &s;hewn, that &s;uch means are adapted to the ends of the greate&s;t holine&s;s and hap|pine&s;s, upon the whole.</P>
<P><Q>If moral evil, and the puni&s;hment of it are nece&s;&s;ary towards promoting univer&s;al good, then the more wick|ed men are, the more they promote that good; and the more they co-operate with their Creator in compleating his great and benevolent plan of univer&s;al happine&s;s.</Q> It is argued, that &s;ince <Q>mi&s;ery brings with it it's utility, why may not wickedne&s;s?</Q></P>

We will rejoice and be exceeding glad in the addi|tion we make to the public good by our vices, and will make our&s;elves more vile." Indeed, he is an enemy to the world, who doth not take &s;atisfaction in moral evil, and prai&s;e God for it's exi&s;tence, if the doctrine we are ex|amining be true. For hath it contributed &s;o much to the perfection and happine&s;s of the moral world? could not the divine character have been manife&s;ted to the creatures to good advantage without it? is it's exi&s;tence the effect of divine determination? and doth it become us to la|ment or repent of <HI>that</HI> which was a nece&s;&s;ary means of the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible good? Shall we grudge the happine&s;s of the moral world?

<P>Upon what evidence, by what rea&s;oning, do men fix down in this conclu&s;ion, that the moral rectitude of holy angels would have been peculiarly endangered had there been no apo&s;tates, the terror of who&s;e puni&s;hment is &s;up|po&s;ed to &s;ecure the inhabitants of the world above in their allegiance? How does it appear that holy angels would have reverenced their maker and father le&s;s, or been le&s;s apprehen&s;ive of his authority, had moral evil never taken place? Whither will this doctrine lead, that the divine perfections could have been exhibited to the intelligent creation only through the intervention of &s;in? Apply it

to the character of a wi&s;e, ju&s;t and benevolent earthly &s;o|vereign. Can the ends of his government be attained, and his true character made to appear, only by means of the rebellion of his &s;ubjects!

For better no law or government than &s;uch as it is be&s;t &s;hould be violated and contemned.

If &s;ome modern metaphy&s;icians had the &s;en&s;e and di&s;cernment of the vulgar in the&s;e matters, it would be happy for them&s;elves and the world. The
<PB N="95" REF="012746_0092_0F90915039CC99B0">
common people have been educated in the belief of &s;uch things as the&s;e; that the mo&s;t exalted motives to holine&s;s are a con&s;ideration of it's intrin&s;ic beauty and excellence, it's tendency to dignify the intelligent nature, to advance the divine glory and &s;ecure his approbation. They have believed that the fear of eternal puni&s;hment is but an infe|rior principle of action&mdash;a &s;pirit that ruleth in &s;laves, not in &s;ons. Are the&s;e mere vulgar errors? So it &s;hould &s;eem, if it be true that the puni&s;hment of devils is what &s;ecureth the per&s;evering holine&s;s of angels and glorified &s;pirits, and e&s;tabli&s;heth the divine authority in their hearts.</P>
<P>Mr. Edwards hath no where &s;aid, that moral evil might not have been prevented, but rather intimated the contra|ry. Nor hath he denied but the human apo&s;tacy might have been permitted without the provi&s;ion of a &s;avior. However, on his principles neither of the&s;e things may be &s;uppo&s;ed. For he hath ventured to &s;ay, he is CERTAIN that moral evil is for the be&s;t&mdash;and that an infinitely wi&s;e being mu&s;t therefore chu&s;e it. Whether it follows or not from the hints that have been given, that moral evil is not be&s;t for the world, we are by no means very &s;ollicitous, becau&s;e we chu&s;e not to be peremptory and confident. Yet we apprehend enough has been &s;aid to create &s;uch a degree of &s;u&s;picion whether it is indeed be&s;t, that <HI>few</HI> "per|&s;ons of good under&s;tanding will &s;ay, they are certain it is be&s;t." Or thus much at lea&s;t we &s;uppo&s;e will follow from the things that have been ob&s;erved, that the advantage of moral evil to the world is not proveable in the way Mr. Edwards has attempted to prove it&mdash;the re&s;ult of which is, that God may do evil, that good may come. Two pro|po&s;itions appear to be mutually a&s;&s;umed by him to prove each other: One while he makes a po&s;tulatum of this, that whatever is, is <HI>therefore</HI> be&s;t; and proceeds to argue, that God determines moral agents to &s;in. At another time, making a po&s;tulatum of this la&s;t po&s;ition, he proceeds to argue, that &s;in mu&s;t therefore be infinitely beneficial to the world. What part &s;oever of his di&s;cour&s;e be examined, the plain con&s;equence appears to be this, that God is the cau&s;e of all wickedne&s;s.</P>

We are wholly ignorant how our own &s;ouls and bodies are united&mdash; are lo&s;t in the contemplation of our own frame. The tri|nity and &s;atisfaction are inexplicable my&s;teries. The &s;cheme of Chri&s;tianity, and the whole moral government of God, are incomprehen&s;ible. Nor would they be other|wi&s;e, and be worthy of him who is perfect in knowledge. His judgments are un&s;earchable, and his ways pa&s;t find|ing out. As the heavens are higher than the earth, &s;o are his thoughts and ways above ours. Although we have &s;uch evidence in general of the truth and reality of the things above-mentioned as in a manner compels our be|lief; yet when the que&s;tion is put, How can the&s;e things be? we di&s;cern in&s;uperable difficulties&mdash;at the &s;ame time we are con&s;cious infidelity would involve us in difficulties &s;till greater.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the que&s;tion before us, if the voice of &s;cripture or rea&s;on be hearkned to, we mu&s;t admit both pre&s;cience and liberty&mdash;and that they are con&s;i&s;tent, tho' after a manner inconceivable by us. For we cannot be|lieve evident contradictions.</P>
<P>We u&s;e the term foreknowledge in accommodation to our own narrow views and way of conceiving things. In an infinite under&s;tanding, there is no before or after&mdash; no &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas. To him who calleth things that are not as though they were, and with whom a thou&s;and years are as one day, the knowledge of futurity is pre&s;ent, knowledge. How then can a finite mind conceive the manner of his knowing futurity? Is there any thing in vi&s;ible creation that affords a re&s;emblance of what we call pre&s;cience. When we undertake to &s;peak on a &s;ubject &s;o high and too wonderful for us, it becomes us to be dif|fident of our&s;elves, and very &s;paring of words, remember|ing that we are of ye&s;terday&mdash;Tho&s;e &s;eem not aware of
<PB N="98" REF="012746_0095_0F909152AC9AABB0">
their own ignorance, and the danger of &s;peaking of God the thing that is not right, who attempt to explain this matter; as though by &s;earching they could find out God &mdash;as though he had taken coun&s;el with them. Ha&s;t thou heard the &s;ecret of God? And do&s;t thou re&s;train wi&s;dom to thy&s;elf?</P>
<P>Some men are apt to depart from evident truth out of regard to ab&s;tru&s;e &s;peculations. They turn a&s;ide from the plain road of common &s;en&s;e, di&s;daining a beaten track, and are carried away with the error of the wicked, under pretence of new and important di&s;coveries. If any truth be plain, this is, that man is free. Next to the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of our own exi&s;tence is that of our moral freedom. Yet a truth &s;o obvious is called in que&s;tion by &s;ome men, becau&s;e they cannot make it agree with the idea they have formed of God's infinite knowledge and eternal coun&s;els.</P>
<P><Q>As to the manner of God's foreknowing certainly contingent future events, that is, which have no nece&s;|&s;ary cau&s;e, nor are to be accompli&s;hed by his own power, and the determination of his will, but produc'd by other free agents; this &s;eems to be incomprehen&s;ible by the human under&s;tanding. That any mind &s;hould fore&s;ee with certainty a di&s;tant event, which does not nece&s;&s;arily proceed from the nature of things, nor is fix'd by the purpo&s;e of a voluntary agent, is wonderful to us and far &s;urpa&s;&s;eth our conception. For as our knowledge of futurity can only re&s;t on one or other of the&s;e founda|tions, we can form no di&s;tinct notion of any foreknow|ledge without them. It is probably their apprehending the divine pre&s;cience after the &s;ame manner, and limit|ing it to the &s;ame grounds, which has occa&s;ioned &s;o much perplexity in the minds of men, and involved their &s;peculations upon this &s;ubject in &s;o much confu&s;i|on. Some imagining that contingent events could not otherwi&s;e be &s;o a&s;certained, as to be infallibly known, have &s;uppo&s;ed peremptory eternal decrees concerning all of them, even the free&s;t actions of men; and not only &s;o, but a previous divine influence on the active powers of rational creatures, exciting them to action: But others judging this to be utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with human liber|ty,
<PB N="99" REF="012746_0096_0F909157EE9E5B50">
and, with re&s;pect to evil actions, incon&s;i&s;tent with the purity and goodne&s;s of the divine nature, yet &s;till adhering to the &s;ame limited foundation of foreknow|ledge, have denied the doctrine of pre&s;cience altogether, or doubted concerning it. I believe the be&s;t way for us to get rid of the&s;e difficulties is wholly to neglect the hypothe&s;es, which have been invented to account for the manner of the divine pre&s;cience, acknowledging that it is to us inexplicable, and yet concluding that this is no &s;ufficient objection again&s;t a doctrine, other|wi&s;e well confirmed.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abernethy's di&s;cour&s;e on divine omni&s;cience.</NOTE></P>
<P>"I admire," &s;ays Dr. Eliot, <Q>the mode&s;ty, as well as goodne&s;s of heart, di&s;covered by the great Mr. Locke, in one of his letters to Mr. Molineux; "I freely own," &s;ays he, "the weakne&s;s of my under&s;tanding, that though it be unque&s;tionable, that there is omnipotence and om|ni&s;cience in God our maker, and I cannot have a clearer perception of any thing than that I am free; yet I can|not make freedom in man con&s;i&s;tent with omnipotence and omni&s;cience in God, though I am as fully per&s;uad|ed of both as of any truths I mo&s;t firmly a&s;&s;ent to, and therefore I have long &s;ince left off the con&s;ideration of the que&s;tion.</Q> The Doctor &s;ubjoins to the&s;e words of Mr. Locke the following pertinent and &s;ea&s;onable reflec|tion: <Q>If &s;ome of our modern rea&s;oners, who have not a tenth part of his under&s;tanding, had a little more of his humility, the world would be free from tho&s;e angry di&s;putes about fate and free-will, liberty and nece&s;&s;ity, which puzzle the heads, but &s;eldom mend the hearts, of tho&s;e who engage in them.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr Eliot's &s;ermon on natural religion, p, 21, 22.</NOTE></P>
<P>To proceed: Pre&s;cience is a difficulty that encumbers Mr. Edwards's own &s;cheme no le&s;s than that of his oppo|nents. For he &s;aith, <Q>There mu&s;t be a certainty in things them&s;elves before they are certainly foreknown,</Q> and affirms that the former "is the foundation" of the latter. (P. 22; 175.) Events have <Q>a fixed certain futurity prior to</Q> foreknowledge, and this antecedent nece&s;&s;ity of their coming to pa&s;s is the cau&s;e of their being certainly foreknown. What is meant by the certainty in things
<PB N="100" REF="012746_0097_0F8BED47BACD4C88">
them&s;elves prior to their exi&s;tence, is as unintelligible as his opinion, <Q>that there is in the nature of things a foun|dation for the knowledge of the being of God, without any evidence of it from his works;</Q> of which notice was taken, Examination, p. 36. marg. If by this certainty be meant any thing different from the divine decrees and determinations, then his argument will &s;tand thus: The certainty there is in things them&s;elves is the foundation of the divine decrees; the divine decrees are the foundation of foreknowledge; and foreknowledge is the foundation of that nece&s;&s;ity which belongs to all events in the natural and moral world. This <HI>&s;eems</HI> to be arguing in a circle. On the other hand, if by this certainty in things them&s;elves be meant the &s;ame as the divine decrees and determinations, then the&s;e being the &s;uppo&s;ed foundation of foreknow|ledge, the latter cannot be the cau&s;e of events, as Mr. Ed|wards repre&s;ents, but the former. Nece&s;&s;ity is the cau&s;e of the knowledge of events, and not the knowledge of them the cau&s;e of their nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Further, If the purpo&s;es and decrees of God, or his de|terminations as to futurity, be antecedent to foreknow|ledge, and the foundation thereof, then his will is deter|mined "at random, by blind contingence," without de&s;ign or fore&s;ight&mdash;<Q>guided by no wi&s;dom, no motive, no intel|ligent dictate whatever&mdash;he only acts by an <HI>Hobbi&s;tical</HI> fatality.</Q> (P. 330, 334.) To &s;peak of the divine will as determined prior to knowledge, is plainly to &s;uppo&s;e it determined without coun&s;el and wi&s;dom, undirected by knowledge and intelligence. And what holine&s;s can there be in &s;uch determinations? It was &s;urely through want of "reflection and re&s;earch"&mdash;through inattention to his own &s;cheme, that Mr. Edwards grounds the certainty of fore|knowledge on an antecedent nece&s;&s;ity of events ari&s;ing from the divine coun&s;els and purpo&s;es. He repre&s;ents the opinion of tho&s;e who teach that God's foreknowledge is antecedent to his decrees, as a &s;ervile &s;ubjecting the Deity to fatal nece&s;&s;ity; and &s;aith, it argues inferiority and &s;er|vitude unworthy of him, and comports with the heathen notion of fate as above the gods; becau&s;e this is to &s;up|po&s;e, &s;aith he, that events have a fixed certain futurity, to
<PB N="101" REF="012746_0098_0F8BED487B16FFB8">
which the divine volitions and de&s;igns are &s;ubject, and mu&s;t be accommodated. (p. 352, 353.) 'Tis not a little &s;urprizing, that Mr. Edwards did not perceive this objec|tion was much more applicable to his own doctrine, than to that of his oppo&s;ers. Be&s;ides, How do the&s;e things agree with his own words, p. 325. <Q>We mu&s;t conceive of the perfection of the divine under&s;tanding as the <HI>foun|dation</HI> of his wi&s;e purpo&s;es and decrees.</Q> As he is not herein reconcileable with him&s;elf, &s;o his principles are not con&s;i&s;tent with the admi&s;&s;ion of forkenowledge. To &s;ay, the certainty of things, or divine determination of events, is <HI>antecedent</HI> to his perfect knowledge of futurity, is to deny <HI>pre&s;cience,</HI> and only to a&s;cribe <HI>after-knowledge</HI> to God. So that while Mr. Edwards &s;uppo&s;eth his own &s;cheme of ne|ce&s;&s;ity clear of all difficulty from the head of fore-know|ledge, it appears not only to militate with it&s;elf, but utterly to preclude that pre&s;cience from which he infers the nece&s;|&s;ity of all events.</P>
<P>We will now enquire, in the la&s;t place, whether pre|&s;cience implies nece&s;&s;ity. Mr. Edwards u&s;eth the terms certainty and nece&s;&s;ity, as tho' they were perfectly &s;ynony|mous; and &s;aith, <Q>Philo&s;ophical nece&s;&s;ity is nothing dif|ferent from certainty.</Q> (P. 22.) It is granted by all who believe fore-knowledge, that <HI>this</HI> really implies the certainty of all future events&mdash;not only that they will come to pa&s;s, but al&s;o that they will come to pa&s;s in &s;uch a cer|tain manner. But the inference is not, that they will come to pa&s;s <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> becau&s;e fore-known&mdash;that they are indi&s;|&s;olubly connected as effects with pre&s;cience as their cau&s;e. Now it is in this &s;en&s;e that Mr. Edwards maintains nece&s;|&s;ity. If fore-knowledge infers nece&s;&s;ity (in his &s;en&s;e of the word nece&s;&s;ity) then it implies an irre&s;i&s;tible determination of the wills and actions of moral agents.</P>
<P>Pre&s;cience has no cau&s;ality in the coming to pa&s;s of the&s;e things which are the objects of it. So far is it from hav|ing any <HI>efficiency</HI> to produce them, that it hath no influence to their production by way of <HI>motive</HI> or excitement. For a motive is &s;omething extant in the mind's view. Now can any moral agent know, previous to any given volition or action, that he &s;hall certainly be determined to &s;uch vo|lition
<PB N="102" REF="012746_0099_0F8BED4938A9E7B8">
or action? If not, then he cannot know that &s;uch voli|tion or action is certainly foreknown. For this would be to &s;ay, that what may never become effect may be foreknown. And if moral agents cannot tell beforehand what is fore|known with re&s;pect to them&s;elves, then foreknowledge can have no influence in determining their actions. For what is not <HI>perceived</HI> cannot excite or move to action; or de|termine the wills of moral agents; nor con&s;equently be con&s;idered as the cau&s;e, ground, or rea&s;on of their being de|termined to this or that. "Nothing," &s;ays Mr. Edwards, <Q>can induce or invite the mind to will or act any thing, any further than it is perceived, or is &s;ome way or other in the mind's view.</Q> (p. 8.) To &s;ay that pre&s;cience is in the view of the creature's mind, wou'd be to a&s;cribe an incommunicable attribute of the Creator to a creature. Foreknowledge, then, has no influence in bringing any moral volitions to pa&s;s&mdash;nor is it even an <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of their becoming effect. It doth not &s;tand in the relation of a cau&s;e, motive, rea&s;on or occa&s;ion to the exi&s;tence of things to come, any more than our knowledge of things pa&s;t or pre&s;ent has &s;uch relation to their exi&s;tence. Herein we have Mr. Edwards's concurrence, p. 175. <Q>I freely allow that foreknowledge don't prove a thing to be nece&s;&s;ary, any more than after knowledge.</Q> Now doth our know|ing that a thing is already come to pa&s;s imply that it came to pa&s;s nece&s;&s;arily? If not, then neither doth foreknow|ledge of a future event imply that &s;uch event mu&s;t come to pa&s;s by nece&s;&s;ity. That we know certainly an event hath already taken place, doth not imply that the nature of that event, or the manner of it's coming to pa&s;s, are de|termined by our knowledge. No more doth divine pre|&s;cience affect the <HI>nature</HI> of events, or the <HI>manner</HI> of their coming into exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Mr. Edwards, as hath been ob&s;erved, makes the di|vine determination, and deci&s;ive ordering and di&s;po&s;ing of all events, the ground of their being foreknown&mdash;he &s;uppo&s;eth the divine determinations alike concern'd in moral volitions and actions, as in tho&s;e things which are the mere work of God&mdash;that it properly belongs to him to di&s;po&s;e, fix and determine the wills of all moral agents,

in every act, from the beginning of their exi&s;tence. And though he a&s;&s;erts not in words a po&s;itive agency of God in evil actions; yet the thing in effect is a&s;&s;erted, as hath been &s;hewn. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Section IV.</NOTE> Upon his &s;cheme God is the author and cau&s;e of &s;in; no le&s;s than of natural good and evil&mdash;the author and cau&s;e of men's vices, no le&s;s than the giver and upholder of life, and fountain of their natural endow|ments and external advantages and enjoyments&mdash;the au|thor of evil di&s;po&s;itions, no le&s;s than of holy and virtuous ones. But do not rea&s;on and &s;cripture &s;hew us, that there is an important difference between his being the author of the former and his being &s;o of the latter&mdash;? that his ope|ration, his determining and di&s;po&s;ing providence, cannot extend to moral evil? <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Every good gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, and cometh down from the father of lights.</HI> But <HI>God cannot be tempted with [moral] evil, neither tempteth he any man.</HI> James 1.13; 17. compared.

If it be a&s;k'd, how can natural evil, any more than moral, proceed from a good cau&s;e? the u&s;ual an&s;wer is &s;ufficient, that the for|mer is the penal con&s;equence of the latter.

We need not &s;cruple to &s;ay that the certainty of events, which foreknowledge implies is as diver&s;e from Mr. Edwards's philo&s;ophic nece&s;&s;ity as truth is from fal&s;|hood, or light from darkne&s;s. To &s;upport his inference from foreknowledge, it was incumbent on him to &s;hew, that this is an extrin&s;ic efficient cau&s;e, who&s;e influence and operation brings into effect the things foreknown. To &s;ay, that foreknowledge is an <HI>antecedent,</HI> and the things foreknown <HI>con&s;equents,</HI> is but trifling, unle&s;s it can be &s;hewn that the latter are indi&s;&s;olubly connected with the former as the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of their exi&s;tence.

<HEAD>SECTION VIII. On texts of &s;cripture mi&s;con&s;trued.</HEAD>
<P>IF from what has been &s;aid it &s;hould appear, that Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ity may ju&s;tly be charged with making an holy and good God the proper cau&s;e of &s;in, (which is the leading objection we have all along had to his book on the will) it can be to every little purpo&s;e to alledge texts of &s;cripture in &s;upport of it. A doctrine &s;o repugnant to our natural apprehen&s;ions of God and his providence cannot be &s;upported by any pretence of autho|rity from him. The holy &s;criptures were not given to contradict and &s;ubvert tho&s;e notions of his moral perfecti|ons and government, which God hath given us by rea&s;on and the light of nature; but to confirm and improve them, as well as to afford us important in&s;truction in things which una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on would never have di&s;covered. If any, therefore, &s;hould bring this doctrine to us, that God is the cau&s;e of moral evil, the direction given to the I&s;ra|elites, in the ca&s;e of being enticed to idolatry, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xiii. 1,&mdash;4.</NOTE> is for our learning, and may &s;erve to regulate our conduct. We know not what right the advocate for &s;uch a doctrine can have to any other an&s;wer. His appealing to the word of God to &s;upport what he advanceth is not very con&s;i&s;tent. For if a doctrine of &s;uch a nature be true, what faith can be had in any &s;uppo&s;ed revelation from God?</P>
<P>Yet it may be of u&s;e to &s;ome readers to take notice of the &s;criptures which are adduced to confirm the afore&s;aid &s;cheme.

Acts ii. 23. iii. 17, 18. iv. 27, 28.</NOTE> Now the&s;e texts either imply an <HI>efficient</HI> determination of the Deity in this event, or they do not: If they do not, they are nothing to the purpo&s;e for which they are produced by the advocates for nece&s;&s;ity. On the other hand, if it can be &s;hewn that they really imply a divine efficiency on the minds of the murderers of our Lord, influencing and nece&s;&s;itating them to this horrid deed; then we &s;hall not he&s;itate to admit, that every &s;pecies and degree of wicked|ne&s;s proceeds from the &s;ame efficiency. For if God may be &s;uppo&s;ed to effect by his agency a crime of &s;uch enor|mity, what &s;hould hinder our believing that all moral evil is the product of his action and influence? But let us com|pare &s;piritual things with &s;piritual, and form our judg|ment from &s;uch a compari&s;on in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Hence it may appear much clearer, that an efficient determinati|on is <HI>not</HI> intended, than it will from the&s;e texts taken by them&s;elves that &s;uch a determination <HI>is</HI> intended.</P>
<P>There is a twofold &s;en&s;e in which tho&s;e moral events, which imply blame in the agents, may yet be &s;aid to come to pa&s;s by the determinate coun&s;el, fore-knowledge and or|dination of God, without implying any active concurrence or efficiency of divine power herein.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Whatever comes to pa&s;s agreable to the predicti|ons of his word, may be &s;aid to take place by his determi|nate coun&s;el and foreknowledge: Such events may be cal|led what his hand and coun&s;el determined before &s;hould be done.</P>
<P>Secondly, Such events as he determines not to prevent by the interpo&s;al of his power, may al&s;o be &s;aid to come to pa&s;s in the &s;ame way. As all po&s;&s;ible futurity was fore|ver

known to God, it hence follows, that in this &s;en&s;e the exi&s;tence of all moral evil is by his determinate coun&s;el and foreknowledge: Nor is there any other difficulty in apply|ing this &s;cripture language to all moral evil that hath taken place, or ever will, than in the application of it to the par|ticular ca&s;e to which it immediately refers in &s;cripture,&mdash; viz. the &s;ufferings of the holy one and the ju&s;t.</P>
<P>What one evangeli&s;t hath delivered thus, The &s;on of man goeth <HI>as it was determined</HI>&mdash;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke xxii. 22.</NOTE> another expre&s;&s;eth in the&s;e terms, The &s;on of man goeth, <HI>as it is written of him,</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxvi. 24.</NOTE> To the &s;ame purpo&s;e &s;aith St. Peter, Tho&s;e things <HI>which God before had &s;hewed by the mouth of all his holy prophets,</HI> that Chri&s;t &s;hould &s;uffer, he hath &s;o fulfilled. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts iii. 18.</NOTE> So Acts xiii. 27. They that dwell at Jeru&s;alem, and their rulers, becau&s;e they knew him not, <HI>nor yet the voices of the prophets,</HI> which are read every &s;abbath-day, they have fulfilled them, in condemning him. See al&s;o ch. xvii. 2, 3. Luke xxiv. 25, 26. Thus it was the determinate coun&s;el of God, that Chri&s;t &s;hould &s;uffer; and in order to this "it was nece&s;|&s;ary God &s;hould" permit him "to fall into the hands of wicked men, (for they could have no power over him, unle&s;s it were thus given them from above) and that he &s;hould lay no re&s;traints upon them, from executing their malici|ous de&s;igns upon him; and this unre&s;trained permi&s;|&s;ion is all that is, or can be &s;ignified by God's delivering up Chir&s;t into their hands&mdash;His power could not <HI>actually concur,</HI> or <HI>effectively</HI> incline them, to the crucifiction of the holy Je&s;us." For although "the hand of God is joined with his council, and applied" to this event; yet "the hand of God relates not &s;o much to his power, as to his wi&s;dom and providential di&s;pen&s;ations." <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Whitby.</NOTE></P>
<P>The con&s;truction Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme fixeth on the &s;criptures under con&s;ideration precludes all di&s;tinction be|tween the <HI>active</HI> and <HI>permi&s;&s;ive</HI> providence of God&mdash;a di&s;|tinction which hath hitherto been e&s;teemed important by the Chri&s;tian church. A writer who &s;pared no pains in collecting the &s;entiments of criticks and commentators, an|tient and modern, upon the &s;criptures, and hath di&s;covered equal judgment and learning in this u&s;eful undertaking,
<PB N="109" REF="012746_0106_0F8BED4FF9A08C58">
has given us the &s;en&s;e of Chri&s;tians on this point with &s;o much per&s;picuity and preci&s;ion, that we &s;hall take liberty to make the following extracts. <HI>Con&s;titutum e&s;t aeterno Dei con&s;ilio, et in S. S. declaratum,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In Engli&s;h thus: It was appointed in God's eternal coun&s;el, and declared in the holy &s;criptures. Though God fore&s;aw, and decreed to permit, Judas's betraying Chri&s;t, yet it is not &s;aid that God determined Judas &s;hould <HI>betray,</HI> but that Chri&s;t <HI>&s;hould go.</HI> There is indeed a divine decree re&s;pecting the &s;ins of men; but then God only <HI>permits,</HI> and over-rules for good, their &s;ins, and by no means wills or determines their commi&s;&s;ion of them&mdash;<HI>(Lucas Bru|gen&s;is.)</HI> If we enquire concerning the actions of Judas, Pilate and Herod, it is certain, indeed, that they did not happen without the father, ina&s;much as a &s;parrow doth not fall to the ground without him. But the will of God re|&s;pecting them was <HI>permi&s;&s;ive,</HI> not <HI>efficient;</HI> which di&s;tincti|on is more agreable to &s;cripture, and the judgment of all the primitive Chri&s;tians, than their opinion who would di&s;criminate <HI>actions</HI> from the <HI>viciou&s;ne&s;s</HI> that is in them. This, in regard to many actions, contradicts the nature of things; for in&s;tance, theft, adultery, and the like, the very naming of which is unintelligible, if the idea of &s;infulne&s;s be &s;eperated therefrom. Tho&s;e al&s;o are equally unworthy of regard, who &s;ay, that the Deity impels men to &s;uch ac|tions for <HI>a good end.</HI> For the end alone cannot make &s;uch actions right, or ju&s;tify tho&s;e decrees which antecedently impo&s;e an ab&s;olute <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of committing them.&mdash;It may be added, that the name of &s;in is ab&s;urd, according to the hypothe&s;is &s;ome proceed upon. For we cannot commit &s;in in tho&s;e actions, which infinite goodne&s;s, by a decree &s;ubver&s;ive of the liberty of our <HI>will,</HI> determineth we &s;hould do. 'Tis more ju&s;t by far to &s;ay with St. Paul, (Acts 14.16.) God <HI>permitted</HI> the nations to walk in their own ways; and if there are any ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;ages el&s;ewhere in &s;cripture to expound them in this &s;en&s;e; <HI>which all the antients did.</HI> (Clemens Origen, Alexandrinus, Origen, Cyprian, Chry&s;o&s;|tom, Salvianus.)

<P>P. 362. of Mr. Edwards's book, Dr. Doddridge is in|troduced in a manner which may lead the reader to &s;up|po&s;e his opinion was the &s;ame with Mr. Edwards's. Only the fir&s;t part of the Dr's note on Luke xxii. 22. is quoted. In the latter part of the note on that text, the Dr. has taken particular care to guard that part Mr. Edwards has quoted again&s;t &s;uch a con&s;truction as this partial view may induce the public to fix upon the Doctor's words. If the reader turns to the place in Dr. Doddridge, it may give him a different view of the Doctor's &s;entiments from what Mr. Edwards's quotation exhibits.</P>
<P>In his note on Acts iv. 28. the Dr. &s;aith, "It is&mdash;rati|onal&mdash;to explain this <HI>determination</HI> in &s;uch a manner, as to make it con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>free agency</HI> of the per&s;ons con|cerned. When God's hand and coun&s;el are &s;aid to have determined the&s;e things, it may &s;ignify God's having <HI>point|ed out</HI> this great event &s;o wi&s;ely concerted in his eternal coun&s;els, and <HI>marked beforehand</HI> as it were <HI>all the boundaries</HI> of it&mdash;in the <HI>prophetic writings.</HI>"</P>
<P>What the Doctor's opinion was re&s;pecting the nece&s;&s;ity of moral actions, as proveable from the pre&s;cience and de|crees of God, we further learn from the following pa&s;&s;ages. Jude v. 4. "<HI>Who were regi&s;tered to this condemnation.</HI> The word <HI>[Progegrammenoi]</HI> may well &s;ignify <HI>de&s;cribed</HI> and <HI>put up|on record;</HI> that is, who&s;e character and condemnation may be con&s;idered as de&s;cribed in the puni&s;hment of other noto|rious &s;inners, who were a kind of repre&s;entatives of them. Which interpretation I prefer to any other, as it tends to clear God of that heavy imputation which it mu&s;t bring
<PB N="111" REF="012746_0108_0F8BED5179167C98">
on his <HI>moral attributes,</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e that he <HI>appoints</HI> men to <HI>&s;in</HI> again&s;t him, and then <HI>condemns</HI> them for doing, what they could not but do, and what they were, independent on their own freedom of choice, fated to. A doctrine &s;o pregnant with <HI>gloomy,</HI> and, as I &s;hould fear, <HI>fatal</HI> con&s;e|quences, that I think it a part of the duty I owe to the <HI>word of God,</HI> to re&s;cue it from the imputation of contain|ing &s;uch a tenet."</P>
<P>Rom. ix. 13. "The&s;e words in their connection with the preceeding and following, do indeed prove, that God acts with a &s;overeign and unaccountable freedom in the di&s;pen&s;ation of his favors,&mdash;Neverthele&s;s it is certain, the apo&s;tle does not here &s;peak of the <HI>eternal &s;tate of Jacob and E&s;au,</HI> (whatever &s;ome may &s;uppo&s;e deducible from what he &s;ays,) nor does he indeed &s;o much &s;peak of their <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> as of their <HI>po&s;terity;</HI> &s;ince 'tis plainly to that <HI>po&s;terity</HI> that both the <HI>prophecies,</HI> which he quotes in &s;upport of his argu|ment, refer. Gen. xxv. 23. Mal. i. 2, 3. <HI>His laying wa&s;te the heritage of the Edomites for the dragons of the wilderne&s;s,</HI> is &s;o different a thing from his appointing the <HI>per&s;on</HI> of <HI>E&s;au</HI> to <HI>eternal mi&s;ery</HI> by a mere act of &s;overeignty, without re|gard to any thing done or to be done by him to de&s;erve it; that I will rather &s;ubmit to any cen&s;ure from my fellow-&s;ervants, than deal &s;o freely with my maker, as to conclude the one from the other."</P>
<P>Rom. ix. 22, 23. "Every attentive reader will, I doubt not, infer for him&s;elf the great difference of phra&s;e, in which they who are <HI>ve&s;&s;els of wrath,</HI> and they who are <HI>ve&s;&s;els of mercy,</HI> are &s;poken of: It being &s;aid &s;imply of the former, that they were <HI>fitted for de&s;truction;</HI> but of the latter, that GOD <HI>prepared them for glory.</HI> A di&s;tinction of &s;o great im|portance, that I heartily wi&s;h we may ever keep it in view, to guard us again&s;t errors, on the right-hand, or on the left."</P>
<P>Secondly, Of &s;uch texts as &s;peak of God's hardening moral agents in &s;in. A &s;ingle in&s;tance under this head may &s;erve in&s;tead of many. The ca&s;e of Pharaoh is much in&s;i&s;ted on, of whom it is repeatedly &s;aid, that God har|dened his heart.</P>
<P>As Mr. Edward's &s;cheme in&s;eperably connects the active and permi&s;&s;ive providence of God, &s;o unle&s;s it can be
<PB N="112" REF="012746_0109_0F8BED5237FA6608">
&s;hewn that God <HI>actually effects</HI> the hardne&s;s of &s;inners' hearts by a po&s;itive agency and influence, the &s;criptures produced under this head by no means help his cau&s;e. Now that God did not, could not, thus harden Pharaoh is manife&s;t from the cleare&s;t notices we have of the divine moral per|fections. The oracles of in&s;piration and rea&s;on in&s;truct us, that God hath no plea&s;ure in wickedne&s;s, that evil &s;hall not dwell with him; that he is of purer eyes than to be|hold it&mdash;that there is no unrighteou&s;ne&s;s with him. There|fore, let no man &s;ay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: For God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man. Is God the cau&s;e of <HI>that</HI> in which he hath no plea&s;ure?&mdash;to which he hath an infinite aver&s;i|on? Doth he produce and effect by his po&s;itive influence <HI>that</HI> which the eyes of his purity cannot behold? Will he puni&s;h with eternal torments <HI>that</HI> which is the production of his own agency on the creature, and is there yet no un|righteou&s;ne&s;s with him? can the Judge of all the earth do right notwith&s;tanding? Doth he determine men to, and by his own operation effect in them, what he cannot be tempted with, nor entice his creatures to perpetrate? In|deed, to effect by his power and influence &s;uch di&s;po&s;iti|ons and actions in the creature as involve all moral turpi|tude, is more than merely to <HI>tempt</HI> moral agents. They may be tempted, and re&s;i&s;t the tempter. But to &s;ay &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions and actions are produced in them by the a|gency of the Deity him&s;elf, is to charge him, not merely with being acce&s;&s;ary to, but the author of, what we call &s;in in the creatures. It mu&s;t forever be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;e|perate the moral turpitude of &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions and actions from the producer or efficient of them. The &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ity excludes, indeed, the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;in. For &s;in is oppo&s;ition to the will of God. But &s;uppo&s;e creatures determined thereto by divine efficiency, this "would ei|ther be a mere pa&s;&s;ive obedience to the will of God, or an active compliance with it; but neither way a contra|diction to it."</P>
<P>If then God could not harden Pharaoh by a po&s;itive in|fluence and efficiency, it remains that he hardened him no otherwi&s;e than by &s;uffering or permitting him to harden
<PB N="113" REF="012746_0110_0F8BED5488994F28">
him&s;elf not interpo&s;ing by an irre&s;i&s;tible influence to pre|vent his obduration&mdash;or withdrawing divine influence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him after enduring him with much long-&s;uffering, and u&s;ing various means to humble and reform him. The riches of divine goodne&s;s and forbearance, in|tended and calculated to lead him to repentance, hardened Pharaoh, as evidently appears from the &s;cripture account of this matter. Agreably we read, P&s;alm lxxxi. 11, 12. But my people would not hearken to my voice, and I&s;ra|el would none of me. SO I gave them up unto their own hearts' lu&s;t; and they walked in their own coun&s;el.</P>
<P>Worthy of remark is the note in Mr. Pool, on Exod. ix. 12. <HI>In quinque precedentibus plagis,</HI> &amp;c. In the five fir&s;t plagues, the hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a&s;cribed to him&s;elf; in the five la&s;t, to God. As many times as he hardened his own heart, God hardened it for puni&s;hment. (Lightfoot's Spicilegium.)</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;ition of the divine agency in the obduration of &s;inners, is, upon the whole, incapable of &s;upport from the &s;acred writings. So gro&s;s a contradiction to rea&s;on, &s;o glaring a repugnancy to the general doctrine of the bi|ble, &s;o bla&s;phemous a reflection on the divine author of the &s;cripture, is implied herein, that it is not a little a&s;toni&s;h|ing any per&s;ons who have a veneration for either &s;hould embrace a &s;cheme of doctrine which contains it, and at|tempt to defend &s;uch &s;cheme by the word of God. It leaves no room for a difference between phy&s;ical and mo|ral nece&s;&s;ity. It &s;uppo&s;eth that God may deceive us. For it is allowed that we act with the conviction of being free agents, and that the &s;criptures con&s;ider and treat us as &s;uch; when in truth we are nece&s;&s;ary agents, all our voli|tions and actions being determined by divine agency. <Q>One writer affirms, that though man is a nece&s;&s;ary a|gent, having all his actions determined by fixed and immutable laws; yet this is concealed from him&mdash;Who conceals it? Does the author of nature conceal it, and this writer di&s;cover it? What deference is not due to the judgment of a metaphy&s;ician, who&s;e &s;agacity is &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly (I had almo&s;t &s;aid omnipotently) penetrat|ing! But, good &s;ir, as you are powerful, you &s;hould have been merciful. It was not kind to rob poor mortals of

this crumb of comfort which had been provided for them in their ignorance; nor generous to publi&s;h &s;o openly the &s;ecrets of heaven, and &s;o bafflle the de&s;igns of providence by a few &s;trokes of your pen. If the laws of nature, after maintaining their authority for &s;ix thou&s;and years, are &s;o little able to &s;tand before him, who knows what havoc he might have made among them in the infancy of their e&s;tabli&s;hment.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BEATTIE on truth, p. 334, 335.</NOTE></P>
<P>La&s;tly, Of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture as are &s;uppo&s;ed to favor the opinion of the advantage of moral evil to the uni|ver&s;e. Whether moral evil is really for the be&s;t&mdash;e&s;pecial|ly whether it be &s;o in that way which the &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ity &s;uppo&s;eth, has been already examined. (Section VI.) And what was offered on this head has in a good mea&s;ure &s;uper|&s;eded the occa&s;ion for a particular reply to the texts pro|duced here. Jo&s;eph's being &s;old by his brethren, and the crucifiction of Chri&s;t, are particularly alledged as proofs from &s;cripture of the be&s;tne&s;s of moral evil.</P>
<P>It is granted, that the wi&s;dom of divine providence is many times con&s;picuous in bringing good out of evil&mdash; particularly in the in&s;tances mentioned, over-ruling for great and important good, what was in its own nature, and in the intention of the authors thereof, exceeding vile. The means wicked men and devils employ to bring to pa&s;s their devices, under the &s;uperintendency of the wi&s;e and gracious governor of the world, are made to an&s;wer bene|ficial purpo&s;es, which they thought not of, and contrary to their de&s;igns. He taketh the wi&s;e in their own crafti|ne&s;s, and carrieth headlong the coun&s;el of the froward. But what is this to the purpo&s;e of proving, that their wick|edne&s;s is for the be&s;t? How doth it hence appear to be be&s;t, that God &s;hould <HI>effect</HI> this wickedne&s;s by his own agency. Unle&s;s this con&s;equence is &s;hewn to follow, it will be remembred, that the in&s;tances refered to prove no|thing to <HI>their</HI> purpo&s;e who maintain the nece&s;&s;ity of moral evil. It may be be&s;t God &s;hould not interpo&s;e to over-rule and nece&s;&s;itate the wills of moral agents; and yet it might have been be&s;t that they them&s;elves had refrain'd from &s;in. It may be be&s;t that God did not prevent the
<PB N="115" REF="012746_0112_0F8BED55F8CF0F70">
exi&s;tence of &s;in by an irre&s;i&s;tible influence; while yet it might have been be&s;t had fallen angels and men never abu&s;ed their liberty, but per&s;evered in virtue.</P>
<P>That moral agents &s;hould be nece&s;&s;itated to be vicious, as a means of the greate&s;t holine&s;s and happine&s;s, is a &s;trange po&s;ition.</P>
<P>To recite &s;cripture te&s;timonies in oppo&s;ition to this hy|pothe&s;is would be needle&s;s, the whole tenor of the bible being in direct contradiction to it. When the &s;criptures de&s;cribe &s;in as the accur&s;ed thing, which &s;eperates the crea|ture from the Creator&mdash;the root of all bitterne&s;s&mdash;the ruin of individuals and communities&mdash;the wages whereof is death temporal and eternal&mdash;Shall any undertake to &s;hew, notwith&s;tanding, that it is for the good of the world&mdash;a means of advancing the divine glory, and therefore the production of his power&mdash;and attempt to &s;upport &s;uch a doctrine by the oracles of truth? In order to this, they mu&s;t prove from the&s;e oracles, that God prefereth &s;in to holine&s;s&mdash;that the apo&s;tacy of men and angels will be mat|ter of eternal prai&s;e in heaven&mdash;that we &s;hould &s;in greedily, that grace may abound&mdash;that &s;in is not oppo&s;ite to the will of God, nor to his moral rectitude&mdash;that the lea&s;t &s;in is yet infinitely oppo&s;ite to God, and therefore an infinite evil&mdash;that infinite evil infinitely promotes God's glory, and therefore is an infinite good&mdash;that his wi&s;dom and holine&s;s require he &s;hould be concern'd in it by an efficient decree and active providence&mdash;that the divine influence and agen|cy are alike concern'd in the vices as in the virtues of his creatures.&mdash;When the&s;e and &s;imilar difficulties are cleared up, it will be &s;oon enough to an&s;wer arguments, formed from texts of &s;cripture to prove, that moral evil is for the good of the univer&s;e, through divine efficiency.</P>
<P>In the next &s;ucceeding &s;ection, &s;ome things will be of|fered, which may be applied in this place. We only add here, that while the friends of revelation exhibit &s;uch an idea of it, its enemies triumph.

<HEAD>SECTION IX. Objections con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>IF the book which hath been under examination really concludes in this principle, that God is the efficient cau&s;e of &s;in; but few of our readers will think it needful to &s;pend much time in con&s;idering objections. Whether this appears to be the true conclu&s;ion of Mr. Edwards's principles, from each of the foregoing &s;ections taken &s;e|perately, or from the evidence exhibited in them all taken together, mu&s;t now be left to the judgment of the reader. Some of his friends acknowledge the conclu&s;ion we have drawn, adopt it as a principle, and undertake to defend it.</P>
<P>Can God then be the cau&s;e of <HI>that</HI> which is acknow|ledged to be contrary to his nature, law and government? Mu&s;t it not be a fruitle&s;s employment of any man's time to attempt to make the negative more manife&s;t than it al|ready is to &s;uch as "have plain &s;en&s;e and can follow it?" If the above-mention'd conclu&s;ion is clearly fa&s;tned on Mr. Edwards, it is &s;uch a <HI>reductio ad ab&s;urdum</HI> as mu&s;t be a full confutation of his doctrine before believers, either Chri&s;tians or Thei&s;ts. Such as adopt the conclu&s;ion, and undertake to vindicate it before the world, &s;hould openly declare on the &s;ide of athei&s;m, and &s;ceptici&s;m, before they can rea&s;onably expect any reply.</P>
<P><Q>But if it is taken for granted, that Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme concludes in nothing &s;hort of the divine effici|ency in moral evil, why then is this &s;ection devoted to the con&s;ideration of objections?</Q> Our an&s;wer (or ra|ther <HI>apology</HI>) is, to cut off occa&s;ion from them that &s;eek it. Though all who believe in God may well take for granted, that there can be no real weight in any rea&s;oning adduced to prove, that moral evil is an effect proceeding from him as its cau&s;e; or in any objections to the contrary principle&mdash;that whatever &s;ubtilty and deception there may be in &s;uch rea&s;oning and objections, there can be no va|lidity therein&mdash;And though we are by no means fully &s;a|tisfied, that any objections, which can with propriety be
<PB N="118" REF="012746_0115_0F8BED583A62D2B8">
made on the footing of the divine agency in moral evil, merit attention; yet we &s;hall take notice of <HI>two</HI> objecti|ons principally, pa&s;&s;ing others which cannot &s;o properly be made on the pre&s;ent hypothe&s;is; or if they could, are le&s;s con&s;iderable. We &s;hall, for in&s;tance, excu&s;e our&s;elves from particularly con&s;idering this objection: That to &s;ay moral agents might in any in&s;tance chu&s;e or act otherwi&s;e than they do, is to &s;uppo&s;e an effect without a cau&s;e&mdash;an objection which has no weight, if moral agents in any ca&s;e determine them&s;elves, or are the cau&s;e of their own voliti|ons&mdash;as we tru&s;t hath been &s;hewn.</P>
<P>We &s;hall al&s;o pretermit the objection, that the opinion of &s;elf-determination makes the creature independent on the creator&mdash;yea, brings the creator into a &s;tate of depen|dance on the creature. The reader may, moreover, find the &s;eeming weight there is in the&s;e objections removed, p. 77, 78. of the examination, in a note.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t further be added, that &s;ome objections Mr. Ed|wards has made to the &s;cheme of liberty in oppo&s;ition to nece&s;&s;ity are fully an&s;wered in that e&s;&s;ay of Dr. Watts's, which he had before him. Mr. Edwards hath propo&s;ed the objections anew without taking notice of the pertinent an&s;wers the Dr. hath given them. If the reader will turn to the 6th &s;ection of the Doctor's e&s;&s;ay, he will there find many objections fully an&s;wered.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the two objections propo&s;ed to be con&s;ider|ed, and which Mr. Edwards much in&s;i&s;ts on, is, That on the principles of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert &s;elf-determination, <Q>the will of God is infinitely cro&s;&s;ed by every act of &s;in that happens&mdash;that he endures what is infinitely di&s;agre|able to him&mdash;infinite grief or pain from every &s;in</Q>&mdash; that creatures have it <Q>in their power to thwart and fru&s;|trate the de&s;igns of the creator,</Q> and to <Q>make him infinitely the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all beings.</Q> This, he &s;ays, certainly follows, if &s;in be not, upon the whole, a|greable to the divine will, and what God chu&s;eth as part of his infinite &s;cheme. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 373.</NOTE></P>
<P>To this we &s;ay, fir&s;t, It is acknowledged that moral evil is in its <HI>nature</HI> infinitely contrary to the perfections, law
<PB N="119" REF="012746_0116_0F8BED58FAB27D40">
and government of God. Now we may with as much rea&s;on &s;ay, he is fru&s;trated, grieved and pained by the ex|i&s;tence of it viewed in its <HI>nature,</HI> as that he chu&s;eth and is plea&s;ed with it viewed in its <HI>con&s;equences</HI>&mdash;even admitting it is for the be&s;t, all things con&s;idered, that moral evil hath taken place. So that if it follows from the opinion of &s;elf-determination, that God is <Q>infinitely cro&s;&s;ed and grieved by every individual &s;in;</Q> the &s;ame con&s;equence follows on Mr. Edwards's own principles. Should it be granted, that every act of &s;in is, in <HI>one</HI> view of it, agreable to the will of God, what he produceth by his efficient de|termination; yet, in <HI>another</HI> view, it is admitted, that it is infinitely contrary and hateful to him. Doth it not then follow, on Mr. Edwards's principles, that God mu&s;t needs be infinitely pained and grieved by it, in proportion to his hatred of it? He vieweth it in its <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>tendency,</HI> as well as in its <HI>con&s;equences.</HI> Mu&s;t he not then be <Q>infinitely the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all beings, as his hatred of &s;in is infinite?</Q></P>
<P>Secondly, It would be conformable to the advice of a wi&s;e man of old <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxvi. 4, 5.</NOTE> to reply to &s;uch an objection, that there are plain and po&s;itive declarations from God him&s;elf, that he is grieved and repenteth at the &s;ins of his creatures. We read, that it <HI>repented</HI> the Lord that he had made man, and it <HI>grieved him at his heart</HI>&mdash;that he is <HI>angry</HI> with the wicked every day&mdash;that they <HI>weary</HI> God by their iniqui|ties&mdash;<HI>vex</HI> and <HI>grieve</HI> his &s;pirit&mdash;walk <HI>contrary</HI> unto him. We read of his heart being <HI>turned</HI> within him, and his <HI>re|pentings</HI> kindled together. Now which &s;hall we admit for truth&mdash;the&s;e expre&s;s and clear declarations of &s;cripture, or the conjectural rea&s;oning on which the objection pro|ceeds? If it be &s;aid, Such &s;criptures are &s;poken <HI>after the manner of men.</HI> The an&s;wer is, They who <HI>thus</HI> object have no right to this plea. For their own rea&s;oning (if rea&s;on|ing it may be called) repre&s;ents that as a <HI>reality,</HI> which the Scriptures doubtle&s;s mention <HI>figuratively,</HI> and by way of accommodation to our way of conceiving things. If their notions of the ends of providence in the permi&s;&s;ion of &s;in are not admitted as indubitable truth, they immedi|ately
<PB N="120" REF="012746_0117_0F8BED59B8669170">
infer, that the Deity mu&s;t needs be affected in the &s;ame manner that human beings are, when any of their &s;chemes are fru&s;trated&mdash;that he is thwarted, pained, griev|ed, and made infinitely mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Thirdly, This way of objecting, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, is high|ly irreverent and unbecoming. It has the appearance of an inclination to bring down to a level with man that is a worm, <HI>that</HI> being who&s;e glory is above the heavens. It is treating the character and government of the LORD GOD OMNIPOTENT with le&s;s deference than is &s;hewn to an earth|ly potentate. Such <HI>leveling</HI> notions introduced into reli|gion are of mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equence. Is the infinite God to be treated with a familiarity, which we &s;hould &s;carce pre&s;ume to u&s;e with a fellow-mortal, who happens to be elevated a little above us! Under a notion of doing honor to his &s;acred name and government, &s;hall we &s;peak of him as though he were <HI>altogether &s;uch an one as our&s;elves!</HI> Shall we &s;ubject the ab&s;olutely perfect &s;pirit to human pa&s;&s;ions and feelings! Would it be le&s;s ab&s;urd, or le&s;s pre&s;umptu|ous and reproachful, to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>the Godhead like to gold, &s;ilver, or &s;tone, graven by art and man's device?</HI> Doth it be|come a creature to &s;peak with &s;uch freedom of THE HIGH AND LOFTY ONE WHO INHABITETH ETERNITY, WHOSE NAME IS HOLY! Angels, who excel in &s;trength, and on whom he &s;hines with the full beams of his glory, confe&s;s their ignorance in the deep things of his nature and pro|vidence. They acquie&s;ce in the will of him who is won|derful in coun&s;el&mdash;who&s;e ways are pa&s;t finding out&mdash;and humbly adore his, un&s;earchable wi&s;dom in his works and admini&s;tration. Yet man, in&s;tead of imitating the&s;e &s;ons of God above, would be wi&s;e beyond the mea&s;ure of his capacity, and rank in the &s;cale of beings. With the &s;hort line of his own rea&s;on he would fathom the aby&s;s of the Deity&mdash;and is wont to view him through the dark medi|um of human prejudices and pa&s;&s;ions. Can God approve our taking the mea&s;ure of his nature from our own? Can he be plea&s;ed with being brought to a level with creatures, who dwell in hou&s;es of clay, and who&s;e foundation is in the du&s;t? Hath he not admoni&s;hed us, <HI>My thoughts are not your thoughts; neither are your ways my ways, &s;aith the
<PB N="121" REF="012746_0118_0F8BED5A808072D0">
Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, &s;o are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</HI></P>
<P>What we have further to offer in reply to this objection will properly enough fall under the other objection refered to above; and which we &s;hall therefore proceed to con&s;i|der. The objection is this: To &s;uppo&s;e moral evil is an effect of fire-will abu&s;ed, or of internal cau&s;ation in the creature, is the &s;ame as to &s;uppo&s;e God him&s;elf the cau&s;e of it, &s;ince he tru&s;ted this matter with the creature, who he knew would abu&s;e liberty. And &s;ince <Q>the mo&s;t im|portant mea&s;ures of his conduct towards mankind, all known to him from the beginning, were formed upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of the being of moral evil, which he could have prevented, how can the <HI>permi&s;&s;ion</HI> of it con|&s;i&s;t with the moral perfections of the Deity,</Q> any more than the &s;uppo&s;ition of his <HI>efficiency</HI> in it? <Q>It mu&s;t eter|nally be the &s;ame thing whether a Creator of infinite power and knowledge created beings originally wicked and mi&s;erable, or gave them power to make them&s;elves &s;o, fore-knowing they would employ that power to their own de&s;truction.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters on the origin of evil, p. 102.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is indeed a di&s;mal dilemma, that God mu&s;t either for|cibly prevent wickedne&s;s, or be him&s;elf the cau&s;e of it. The former he hath not done: For it is certain that wick|edne&s;s is in the world. Mu&s;t we then embrace the other part of the dilemma? Is it the mo&s;t rational way of ac|counting for the exi&s;tence of &s;in to &s;ay, that God createth beings originally wicked, of infu&s;eth wickedne&s;s into them afterwards? What relief can it be to the mind of one who really believes a God to &s;ay, that &s;in proceeds from him as the cau&s;e? What an&s;wer can the maintainer of this principle make to the athei&s;t? For whether is better, to &s;ay there is no God? or to &s;ay there is a God indeed, but that he, and he only, is the cau&s;e of wickedne&s;s? Suppo&s;e moral evil is for the be&s;t; it is &s;till a mo&s;t daring a&s;&s;ertion to &s;ay, it was be&s;t the divine efficiency &s;hould bring it into exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Some argue, if &s;in is not for the be&s;t, it would certainly have been prevented, &s;ince God foreknew and might have prevented it. On the&s;e premi&s;es they conclude, that &s;in
<PB N="122" REF="012746_0119_0F8BED5B39BDF798">
mu&s;t be an effect of divine operation and production.&mdash;A con&s;equence which by no means follows; and which in|volves &s;uch impiety, that no &s;uppo&s;eable difficulties attend|ing the exi&s;tence of moral evil &s;hould compel us to admit it. To embrace this con&s;equence in order to rid our&s;elves of one difficulty, would be to involve our&s;elves in a far greater&mdash;an inextricable one, ab&s;olutely irreconcileable with the moral perfections of God. And when he is rob'd of <HI>the&s;e,</HI> his glory is taken from him: The name of a Deity may be retained, but no more.</P>
<P>On the hypothe&s;is before us, how is it po&s;&s;ible to know that God is holy? that he loves righteou&s;ne&s;s, and hates wickedne&s;s? For can he hate the effects of his own pro|ducing&mdash;the operation of his own power&mdash;his own acts? By &s;uppo&s;ition all &s;in is his act&mdash;the fruit of his agency or efficiency. Why then is not &s;in very good, as much as any part of the Creator's work? If the di&s;po&s;ition in aban|doned &s;inners and apo&s;tate &s;pirits, no le&s;s than the contrary temper in &s;aints and angels, is the product of divine energy, by what rule can we determine that holine&s;s is plea&s;ing, and wickedne&s;s offen&s;ive, to him? Though the operations of our own minds clearly declare to us, that moral evil is contrary and odious to God; yet what el&s;e can we con|clude than that tho&s;e perceptions are a delu&s;ion? And if our own feelings are delu&s;ive, this particular impre&s;&s;ion or idea, that there is a God and moral governor, may be &s;o. The &s;uppo&s;ition of the exi&s;tence of matter or &s;pirit may be a delu&s;ion. Our own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s may be &s;o. We may be deluded in &s;uppo&s;ing that we our&s;elves exi&s;t, though the very &s;uppo&s;ition clearly implies our exi&s;tence. No <Q>paradoxes were ever brought forth by the mo&s;t abject &s;uper&s;tition, or the mo&s;t frantic enthu&s;ia&s;m, more in|credible</Q> than the wi&s;dom of the pre&s;ent age hath pro|duced. To &s;uppo&s;e that the alwi&s;e Creator and governor of the world effects by his own agency what is infinitely repugnant to his pure and holy nature, is as marvellous a paradox as was ever publi&s;hed. We might rather &s;ay, that his wi&s;dom required all rebels &s;hould peri&s;h everla&s;tingly, than &s;ay, that an holy God fir&s;t effected by his own ener|gy their rebellion, as the medium of di&s;playing his own
<PB N="123" REF="012746_0120_0F8BED5C2E9C7EC0">
perfections and communicating the greate&s;t happine&s;s to the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem. We might with as much appear|ance of rea&s;on &s;ay, that the happine&s;s of the univer&s;e is not the care of the infinite Creator and parent of it, as &s;ay, that he produceth moral evil as a nece&s;&s;ary means of this happine&s;s. As well might we &s;ay, that wi&s;dom required God &s;hould not create the worlds&mdash;&s;hould not form crea|tures capable of moral evil. What weight, then, &s;hould be allowed to objections which proceed on a &s;uppo&s;ition &s;o reproachful to that being who&s;e work is perfect&mdash;? a God of truth, and without iniquity? A &s;cheme founded in a principle &s;o horrible, &s;o &s;hockingly ab&s;urd and impious as this, that an holy, wi&s;e and good God is at the &s;ame time the efficient of &s;in, and an avenger to execute wrath upon the &s;ubjects of it, neither demands, nor will admit any other an&s;wer than that in the book, of Job, <HI>Far be it from God that he &s;hould do wickedne&s;s, and from the Almighty, that he &s;hould commit iniquity.</HI> No man &s;hould &s;uffer him|&s;elf to be in the lea&s;t &s;taggered by objections formed on the &s;uppo&s;ition of the truth of &s;uch a &s;cheme, whether he is able di&s;tinctly to an&s;wer the objections or not. An at|tempt to &s;upport &s;uch a &s;cheme de&s;erves to be rejected with contempt and abhorrence. No po&s;&s;ible objections founded on &s;uch a ba&s;is can have any weight by rea&s;on of the TERRIBILITY of the hypothe&s;is it&s;elf. The public will not think there is occa&s;ion for, or even propriety in, taking up time to con&s;ider objections &s;tated on this ba&s;is. 'Tis &s;uf|ficient to &s;ay with the excellent Mr. Howe, <Q>That God doth by an <HI>efficacious</HI> influence move and determine men to wicked actions, I mo&s;t <HI>re&s;olvedly</HI> deny.</Q></P>
<P>Some &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e, that the <Q>goodne&s;s of God, or his rectitude, require the exertion of his utmo&s;t power for preventing evil.</Q> But this <Q>is not to be imagined&mdash; The wi&s;dom of God requires that his operation &s;hould be according to the order which he has e&s;tabli&s;hed, and to the nature of things which he has wi&s;ely framed to be pre&s;erved inviolable. As in the government of the inanimate creatures, he acts <HI>&s;uitably</HI> to their natures, mov|ing and di&s;po&s;ing of them by the irre&s;i&s;tible determina|tion of his &s;overeign will, &s;o his influence on moral a|gents
<PB N="124" REF="012746_0121_0F8BED5E770BD3D0">
is &s;uch as does not de&s;troy the e&s;&s;ential powers which he has given them.</Q></P>
<P>"Let it be more particularly con&s;idered, fir&s;t, that perhaps there is not, nor can be, any being of a limited under&s;tanding above the po&s;&s;ibility of being mi&s;led in its moral conduct; and all the orders of created free agents mu&s;t naturally be in a &s;tate of trial, till by a right u&s;e of liberty their integrity is confirmed&mdash;Every imperfect a|gent, having a variety in his frame, mu&s;t have propen&s;i|ons to particular objects which are adapted to the indi|gence of his condition; which propen&s;ions in a regular moral con&s;titution, are under the government of con&s;ci|ence; but their being does not depend upon it. They are excited by the pre&s;ence of their &s;uitable objects, or per|haps without it; and though their fir&s;t motions, and per|haps their continuance in the mind for &s;ome time, may be innocent, yet it is ea&s;ily conceivable that they may de|mand a gratification, in circum&s;tances and degrees, which con&s;cience forbids."</P>
<P>"Here then is a tendency or temptation to evil, from which the creature by the right u&s;e of its own powers may e&s;cape, and thereby be more confirmed in virtue; but a po&s;&s;ibility of falling and corrupting it&s;elf &s;eems to be in&s;eperable from every finite nature; and even the danger of it &s;eems naturally to attend the &s;tate of all finite moral agents, during &s;ome part of their exi&s;tence&mdash;We know that we are capable both of doing right and wrong; and our moral powers &s;o con&s;tituted, with &s;uch a freedom, we cannot help thinking a very high privilege; whereby we are rai&s;ed above the condition of many other beings, and have the e&s;&s;ential foundation of noble enjoyments."</P>
<P>"Secondly, The human mind nece&s;&s;arily appears to it&s;elf the cau&s;e both of the moral good and evil which is done by it&mdash;The capacity is derived wholly from God, and is pre&s;erved by him; the particular determination is from our&s;elves; only influenced, &s;o far as is con&s;i&s;tent with our free agency, by &s;etting before us &s;ufficient mo|tives to good. Yet the mind has natural power of making a wrong choice. We mu&s;t then be condemned by our own hearts, in charging the human con&s;titution as defec|tive
<PB N="125" REF="012746_0122_0F8BED5EF8B52A88">
to the purpo&s;es of virtue, and thereby of happine&s;s, and impeaching the goodne&s;s of its author; &s;ince we are con&s;cious to our&s;elves, that we are furni&s;hed with all that is nece&s;&s;ary, and know of no power that is wanting to our doing good and e&s;chewing evil."</P>
<P>"Thirdly, Whereas it is alledged that &s;ince God fore|&s;aw men would abu&s;e their liberty,&mdash;goodne&s;s requir'd that the occa&s;ion of &s;uch an abu&s;e &s;hould have been pre|vented. The an&s;wer is,&mdash;that the futurity of the actions of free agents, of which them&s;elves are the &s;ole cau&s;es, is no more determined by the divine appointment, than the actual production of them is affected by his power."</P>
<P>"Fourthly, It mu&s;t be acknowledged that, &s;trictly &s;peaking, God&mdash;could have created moral agents much more perfect than men are; given them a greater mea&s;ure of knowledge; &s;et the motives of virtue in &s;o &s;trong a light before them, as more effectually to &s;ecure their attach|ment to it&mdash;could have placed them in a &s;tate much more free from temptations, and con&s;equently in le&s;s dan|ger of making detection&mdash;could have prevented the con|juncture of circum&s;tances in which he fore&s;aw liberty could be abu&s;ed. But&mdash;&s;hall we take upon us to &s;ay, that the order of the creation, and the ends for which it was made, did not require, or even allow, that there &s;hould be &s;uch a rank of beings in it, con&s;tituted as we are, with under|&s;tanding, liberty, and moral affections, but capable of &s;in, tempted to it, and thereby in danger of becoming unhap|py through their own fault? or that the pre&s;ent con&s;titu|tion, in this branch of it which relates to free agents, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;dom and moral perfections of the &s;upreme Being." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abernethy's di&s;cour&s;es on divine goodne&s;s.</NOTE></P>

<P>Tho&s;e arguments al&s;o and illu&s;trations in the ab&s;tract philo&s;ophy, which are not obvious to ordinary under&s;tandings, are &s;ometimes cal|led <HI>metaphy&s;ical.</HI> But as the principles of this philo&s;ophy, however well expre&s;&s;ed, appear &s;omewhat ab&s;tru&s;e to one who is but a novice in the &s;tudy; and as very plain principles may &s;eem intricate in an author who is inattentive to his expre&s;&s;ion, as the be&s;t authors &s;ome|times are, it would be unfair to reject, or conceive a prejudice again&s;t, every doctrine in morals that is not perfectly free from ob&s;curity.

<P>WE mean not to &s;peak contemptibly of metaphy&s;ics, as &s;uch, and properly applied. There is probably no &s;cience but may (in addition to its advantages in other re&s;pects) claim &s;ome merit as being &s;ub&s;ervient, more or le&s;s, to the elucidation and confirmation of religion and morals. Logic, natural philo&s;ophy, the mathematics, po|lite literature have been greatly &s;erviceable to mankind in this view. And po&s;&s;ibly metaphy&s;ic hath been of &s;ome &s;mall advantage in the &s;ame re&s;pect: Though the injury which the mi&s;application of it hath done religion, at one time and another, if put into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale, might far outweigh it's advantages.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="012746_0124_0F8BED6081BA7970">Admitting metaphy&s;ics may be profitably applied to religious &s;ubjects; yet (without undertaking to pre&s;cribe the exact limits) it will doubtle&s;s be granted

<P>It may be &s;ubmitted to public con&s;ideration, whether fir&s;t principles can, without danger, be brought to the te&s;t of metaphy&s;ics. The being of a God we call one of the&s;e principles; the immediate con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s mankind have of liberty and accountablene&s;s, another; and &s;ince the &s;uppo&s;ition that God is the cau&s;e of &s;in wholly robs him of his moral character, we venture to add, that the negative of this is another fir&s;t principle. The works of creation without us, and the witne&s;s for God within us, in&s;tantly atte&s;t the truth in the&s;e points, as &s;oon as they are mentioned. 'Tis very que&s;tionable whether metaphy|&s;ics have been, or can be, u&s;ed to any advantage, on the&s;e manife&s;t points, even again&s;t the &s;ophi&s;try of infi|dels. We &s;ee not why a philo&s;opher and metaphy&s;ician is not obliged to take up with that evidence here which affords clear conviction to men of plain under&s;tanding. When believers in God have refered the &s;ophi&s;tical rea&s;on|er again&s;t his being and perfections to that inconte&s;tible proof of them which the vi&s;ible world exhibits, they have done their duty&mdash;all that is required, or that can indeed be done. Ab&s;tract rea&s;oning, it may be pre&s;umed, will afford no conviction, where the con&s;tant atte&s;tations to the being of a God in creation and providence do not. The oppo&s;ing metaphy&s;ics to metaphy&s;ics will keep the infidel in countenance. It is an intimation to him, that he has &s;ome rea&s;on for his incredulity. For he pretty naturally concludes, that the being of a God would not be brought into the field of debate by tho&s;e who believe it, were there not &s;ome rea&s;on to doubt it. Principles manife&s;t on fir&s;t propo&s;al, if men will open their eyes, nei|ther need nor can receive any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from metaphy&s;ics; and tho&s;e who would make them undergo the peril of a metaphy&s;ical &s;crutiny may find they have expo&s;ed them to be rejected.</P>
<P>The other two principles mentioned <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> evident
<PB N="128" REF="012746_0125_0F8BED6139861300">
as the being of a God, and require no metaphy&s;ical proof&mdash; viz. God cannot be tempted with evil, and tempteth no man; (or, in other words, is not the cau&s;e of &s;in;) and that mankind are not nece&s;&s;itated or de&s;tined to chu&s;e and act in every in&s;tance as they do, but might chu&s;e and act otherwi&s;e&mdash; at lea&s;t in &s;ome in&s;tances. Metaphy&s;ics have been &s;o far from &s;trengthening the evidence of the&s;e ob|vious truths, that, on the contrary, hereby they have been perplexed and made dubious&mdash;yea, &s;ome &s;eem to think they have demon&s;trated them to be fal&s;e.</P>
<P>Not one in an hundred of mankind can apprehend a metaphy&s;ical proof of religion&mdash;a &s;ubject in which all ranks are alike intere&s;ted. Common people are, indeed much better phy&s;icians, than metaphy&s;icians. Nor is every good natural Philo&s;opher &s;killed in moral philo&s;ophy or ver&s;ed in the ab&s;tract nature of immaterial beings. It is &s;ometimes &s;aid, that phy&s;ic oftner kills than cures. Such is metaphy&s;ic to the mind. Where it prevents or removes a &s;light moral indi&s;po|&s;ition in one in&s;tance, it probably brings on a fatal di&s;tem|per in more in&s;tances. Nor is a corro&s;ive ever eligible, when a lenitive will an&s;wer the end.</P>
<P>The plaine&s;t and mo&s;t important principles of revelation would not endure a metaphy&s;ical di&s;qui&s;ition. At lea&s;t, the &s;acred writers have not u&s;ed &s;uch rea&s;oning&mdash;not tho&s;e of them who were be&s;t able to rea&s;on in this manner. Mo&s;es, I&s;aiah, Ezekiel and St. Paul have not. Unparralleled &s;am|ples of <HI>eloquence</HI> and <HI>the &s;ublime</HI> have been often produced from their writings; but we don't call to mind that any in&s;tances of their <HI>metaphy&s;ical</HI> rea&s;oning have been adduced. In&s;tances of &s;trong rea&s;oning their writings abound with particularly St. Paul's. But he di&s;claims metaphy&s;ics&mdash;not &s;urely as being above his abilities; but as of no u&s;e on the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential point of religion&mdash;rather injurious than helpful. As he is the principal new-te&s;tament writer, we beg leave to make a few &s;trictures on his character and writings, with a more immediate view to the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent &s;ection.</P>
<P>He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an "amazing force of genius, as well as invincible courage, and a &s;pirit of patience, which no fatigue could overcome, and which no &s;ufferings or trials could <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">. He was ver&s;ed in the learned arts,

and able to combat the Jewi&s;h doctors and Pagan philo|&s;ophers with their own arms." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;heim, Vol. I. P. 25.</NOTE> His noble birth, added to his natural genius, literary acquirements, ardent zeal and un&s;haken firmne&s;s of mind, &s;eemed, even <HI>in the eye of the world,</HI> to qualify him for a principal in&s;trument in the defence and propagation of the go&s;pel. Did then the au|thor of Chri&s;tianity, in the appointment of St. Paul to this bu&s;ine&s;s, proceed on maxims of worldly wi&s;dom? By no means. The&s;e accompli&s;hments, which di&s;tingui&s;hed St. Paul from his fellow-apo&s;tles, were the mo&s;t powerful ob|&s;tacles to his embracing Chri&s;tianity. They were em|ployed to root out the go&s;pel. No one per&s;ecuted it more furiou&s;ly than he&mdash;no one de&s;pi&s;ed it more. But when it plea&s;ed God <HI>to reveal his Son in him,</HI> his &s;hining talents were fervently applied to the purpo&s;e for which they were given, and became eminently &s;ub&s;ervient to the further|ance of the faith, which once he de&s;troyed. Let us reflect a moment in what manner he u&s;ed them as an apo&s;tle of Chri&s;t&mdash;as his example is for &s;ucceeding mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Here we have many &s;triking in&s;tances of his zeal, elo|quence and rea&s;oning. We mean to take notice of the la&s;t more e&s;pecially&mdash;his rea&s;oning with Jewi&s;h doctors and pa|gan philo&s;ophers&mdash;on the principles of natural religion, and the revelations of God to the Jews. He well knew what expectations of a magnificent temporal prince the doctors of the law had rai&s;ed in mankind&mdash;how oppo&s;ite the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem was to the reigning philo&s;ophy of the world&mdash;particularly what exception the pride of the Gre|cian philo&s;ophers took to it on account of its plainne&s;s and &s;implicity. He would naturally al&s;o call to mind his own prejudices again&s;t the go&s;pel on the&s;e accounts. And as he had frequent occa&s;ion to confer with men of this character at Jeru&s;alem, Rome, Athens and Corinth, it may be worth while to enquire in what manner he rea|&s;oned with them? Metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oning would have been be&s;t accommodated to their ta&s;te: And if ever there is a propriety in introducing this kind of rea&s;oning into reli|gion, Paul had occa&s;ion for it, and was able to manage it to advantage. It might particularly be conjectured, that
<PB N="130" REF="012746_0127_0F8BED62B8BBBE20">
a man of Paul's learning would have offered a laboured di&s;&s;ertation on the ab&s;tract nature of the &s;upreme &s;pirit, (which would have been rea&s;oning metaphy&s;ically) when encountered by the learned philo&s;ophers from among the Epicureans and Stoics; when accu&s;ed of being a &s;etter forth of &s;trange gods&mdash;when brought unto Areopagus&mdash; &s;urrounded by philo&s;ophers, &s;enators and plebeians&mdash;under|taking to convince them of their &s;uper&s;tition, and reclaim them from their idolatry. But to lead them to the know|ledge of the true God, (their ignorance of whom was proclaimed in the in&s;cription on one of their altars) what method did he take? Ob&s;ervable to this purpo&s;e is his &s;peech, while he &s;tood in the mid&s;t of Mars-hill. <Q>Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too &s;uper&s;titious&mdash;God that made the world, and all things therein, &s;eeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands: Neither is wor&s;hiped with mens hands, as though he needed any thing; &s;eeing he giveth to all life, and breath and all things.</Q></P>
<P>How plain, and yet how forceable, is this rea&s;oning?&mdash; adapted equally to wi&s;e and unwi&s;e. He does not di&s;|cour&s;e as a philo&s;opher would on the nature of &s;pirit ab|&s;tracted from matter, but makes a familiar appeal to the works of vi&s;ible creation and providence, in proof of the exi&s;tence and perfection of God, and thence infers the ac|countablene&s;s of mankind to him, as moral governor and judge. This was to rea&s;on as became a mini&s;ter of that ma&s;ter who &s;ent him not to preach with wi&s;dom of words.</P>
<P>To the &s;ame purpo&s;e he ob&s;erves, that the works of vi|&s;ible nature, and particularly the operations of their own minds, &s;hould have been regarded by the pagan Romans as demon&s;trable proofs of the being, attributes and pro|vidence of God&mdash;that their not being induced to glorify him as God, on this clear evidence, was &s;o far from be|ing any argument of their &s;uperior wi&s;dom, that, on the contrary, it proved them inexcu&s;eable and fools, notwith|&s;tanding all their profe&s;&s;ions of wi&s;dom. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 19, 20; 22. ch. ii. 14, 15.</NOTE> In like manner he &s;ays, God left not him&s;elf without witne&s;s among the

<P>The&s;e in&s;tances are examples of Paul's rea&s;oning with Pagan idolaters. He argues from the works of creation and providence, which lie open alike to learned and un|learned. Here is no ab&s;tract, metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oning&mdash; all is ea&s;y to be under&s;tood.

<P>When he treated with the Jewi&s;h doctors, or the people of I&s;rael, he did not (as before heathen) recur to the works of nature; but taking the principles of natural religion for granted, he rea&s;oned with them out of tho&s;e &s;criptures, which they acknowledged were given by in&s;piration of God. And though all his writings di&s;cover the good rea&s;oner, as well as the good man, full of the holy Gho&s;t; yet we do not recollect that he rea&s;oned metaphy&s;ically, either before Jews or heathen&mdash;Great plainne&s;s of &s;peech ap|pears in all his rea&s;onings, as became a mini&s;ter of the new te&s;tament. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">11 Cor. iii. 12.</NOTE> He was not a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t before the Jewi&s;h Rabbi's or pagan philo&s;ophers, although it's di&s;tingui&s;hing doctrine was to the former a &s;tumbling block, and to the latter fooli&s;hne&s;s. The Greeks held the <HI>go&s;pel revelation</HI> in great contempt, becau&s;e they found not that wi&s;dom of this world which they &s;ought in it. The apo&s;tle held <HI>their</HI> worldly wi&s;dom in equal contempt, be|cau&s;e it &s;et it&s;elf in oppo&s;ition to that go&s;pel which is the power of God, and the wi&s;dom of God. He came not with excellency of &s;peech or of wi&s;dom (which he, if any man, could have u&s;ed) declaring the te&s;timony of God. His &s;peech and preaching was not with enticing words of man's wi&s;dom; but in demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit, and of power, that the faith of Chri&s;tians might &s;tand, not in the wi&s;dom of men, but in the power of God. He with his brethren renounced the hidden things of di&s;hone&s;ty, not walk|ing in craftine&s;s, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by the manife&s;tation of the truth commending them&s;elves to every man's con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God.

He enters a caution to the Colo&s;|&s;ians, Beware le&s;t any man &s;poil you through philo&s;ophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudi|ments of the world, and not after Chri&s;t. He admoni&s;heth Timothy to avoid oppo&s;itions of &s;cience fal&s;ely &s;o called&mdash; to withdraw from &s;uch as dote about que&s;tions and &s;trifes of words. Upon the whole he declares, that the world by wi&s;dom knew not God&mdash;that what the pride of philo&s;ophy &s;tigmatized as the fooli&s;hne&s;s of preaching, was the &s;cheme infinite wi&s;dom had determined upon for the &s;alvation of believers&mdash;that the fooli&s;hne&s;s of God was wi&s;er than men, and the weakne&s;s of God &s;tronger than men.&mdash;Thus was fulfilled what was foretold, <Q>I will de&s;troy the wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e, and will bring to nothing the under&s;tanding of the prudent.

<P>From what has been ob&s;erved it appears, that the chief of the apo&s;tles, notwith&s;tanding his learning, was &s;o far from making u&s;e of metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oning in treating with tho&s;e who believed the go&s;pel, that he made no u&s;e of it for the conviction of infidels, either among Jews or heathen&mdash;that he rather di&s;claimed it as dangerous, than patronized it as helpful, to the cau&s;e of truth. Speaking of his own mini&s;try, and that of his fellow-apo&s;tles, he &s;aith, We &s;peak not as plea&s;ing men, but God who trieth our hearts. For neither at any time u&s;ed we flattering words&mdash;nor of men &s;ought we glory.

<P>It may be &s;aid, St. Paul mu&s;t have u&s;ed ab&s;tract rea&s;on|ing on &s;ome occa&s;ions, or his beloved brother Peter would not have te&s;tified, that there are things in his epi&s;tles <HI>hard

<P>But it is more than time to remind the reader what im|provement Mr. Edwards hath made of metaphy&s;ical rea|&s;oning. This we &s;hall do by adducing a number of in|&s;tances, which may &s;erve to &s;hew the precariou&s;ne&s;s, &s;ub|tilty and danger of &s;uch rea&s;oning. All the argumentati|on of his book really concludes in this, that God is the cau&s;e of &s;in. This is the capital error, which, we tru&s;t, a pro|fe&s;&s;ing people will never admit. And though he doth not acknowledge it, yet it mu&s;t be embraced if his foundation be firm. The following &s;pecimen may &s;hew, that his con|clu&s;ions are by no means fairly drawn from his premi&s;es&mdash; or that one or the other are fal&s;e.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e inert matter cannot begin or alter its own mo|tion; hence Mr. Edwards infers, that an intelligent &s;pirit can in no ca&s;e begin or alter its own volitions and actions.</P>
<P>If there can be no effect without a cau&s;e; he infers, that there can be no principle of efficiency in moral agents.</P>
<P>If a moral agent is &s;uppo&s;ed to determine his own voli|tions; then he infers, that the act of volition it&s;elf is &s;elf-determined, and hath no cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="012746_0131_0F8BED6767DC21D0">He takes for granted, that volition, even with re&s;pect to the mo&s;t ca&s;ual thing, is an act of preference; and then concludes, that, in the mo&s;t indifferent thing, there mu&s;t be an apparent rea&s;on for willing as we do rather than otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e a perfect equilibrium or ab&s;olute indifference is not e&s;&s;ential to liberty; he concludes, that a power to chu&s;e one thing or its oppo&s;ite is incompatible with liberty.</P>
<P>If every moral volition hath &s;ome motive, then that motive is the cau&s;e of the volition&mdash;and therefore moral agents them&s;elves are not the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e a thing is in our power, if con&s;equent to our election; therefore it is in our power, though the election of it is not.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the oppo&s;ition of one's will to what is required, may be no excu&s;e; therefore the want of a power to be willing is none.</P>
<P>(His rea&s;oning on &s;elf-determination may be well &s;um|med up thus: Becau&s;e a man cannot take the &s;econd &s;tep without the fir&s;t; therefore he cannot take the fir&s;t without a previous one.)</P>
<P>Becau&s;e Adam's lap&s;e may be the &s;ource of a blameable impotency in his po&s;terity; therefore original impotency in him&s;elf might be blameable.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the e&s;&s;ence of &s;in lies in its nature; therefore the doer of wickedne&s;s is not the cau&s;e of it&mdash;and therefore it is no reproach to &s;ay, that God is the cau&s;e of &s;in.</P>
<P>It is laid down for a principle, that a creature never commits &s;in till divine influence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance is with|drawn; hence it is infered (not unju&s;tly, if the principle a&s;&s;umed be true) that man's fir&s;t apo&s;tacy was owing to the want or withdraw of divine influence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e natural (or nece&s;&s;ary) effects, and moral habits of holine&s;s, proceed from the po&s;itive influence and exer|tion of the Deity; therefore moral evil doth.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e God is nece&s;&s;arily holy, &amp;c. therefore the holi|ne&s;s or pollution of creatures is nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;therefore a real and original nece&s;&s;ity of &s;in is con&s;i&s;tent with blame and puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e God permits &s;inners to harden them&s;elves;
<PB N="135" REF="012746_0132_0F8BED67F95C3828">
therefore their obduracy is the effect of his ordination, di&s;po&s;al and determination, as the cau&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XI. Recapitulation.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Edwards's book was wrote with a view to &s;ub|vert the opinion of &s;elf-determination, and e&s;ta|bli&s;h the doctrine of univer&s;al nece&s;&s;ity. He endeavoreth to prove, that the volitions and actions of moral agents have a like dependence on a cau&s;e without them&s;elves as effects in the natural world&mdash;that all events, from the be|ginning of the world to the end, are unalterably, unavoid|ably and circum&s;tantially determined. And while he teach|eth, that this nece&s;&s;ity, in reference to moral events, is of the moral kind, and therefore &s;uppo&s;eth it con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t perfect liberty, he yet maintains that moral acti|ons are all &s;ubject to an original real nece&s;&s;ity as ab&s;olute as natural.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of this general &s;y&s;tem, he &s;ets him&s;elf to &s;hew, What determines the will? and it is particularly and very largely in&s;i&s;ted, as a thing of chief importance, that the will is always determined by the highe&s;t motive, or by what appears mo&s;t agreable to the mind; which is called a moral cau&s;e, and the determination of the will hereby a nece&s;&s;ary determination.</P>
<P>Three things have been propo&s;ed in the examination of this &s;y&s;tem. Fir&s;t, An enquiry into the &s;uppo&s;ed connec|tion of volition with the highe&s;t motive. Secondly, The indi&s;&s;oluble connection of moral cau&s;es and effects. And thirdly, An attempt to &s;hew, that internal, moral liberty, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from external or animal, belongs to moral agents&mdash;that Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ity, if admit|ted in theory, is not applicable to practice.</P>
<P>Under the fir&s;t of the&s;e heads, it was &s;hewn, that if the highe&s;t motive were allowed to be the <HI>next</HI> and <HI>immediate</HI> cau&s;e of volition, this is no re&s;olution of the que&s;tion, as it doth not &s;hew the <HI>original</HI> and <HI>true</HI> cau&s;e thereof. The enquiry is not pur&s;ued to the end, the <HI>foundation</HI> of the will's determination is not di&s;covered. What it is that gives cau&s;al influence to motive, or wherein its energy
<PB N="138" REF="012746_0135_0F8BED6A38B230D0">
con&s;i&s;ts, remains &s;till to be pointed out. But it was en|deavored to be proved, in the next place, by various con&s;i|derations, and particularly from Mr. Edwards's own au|thority and rea&s;oning, that in truth the &s;tronge&s;t motive is not the moral cau&s;e of volition, and that there is no ne|ce&s;&s;ary coincidence between the one and the other. And la&s;tly, that volition is not the proper cau&s;e of external action, any more than the highe&s;t motive is of volition.</P>
<P>After the mention of &s;ome preliminary principles, it was enquired, under the next head of the propo&s;ed exa|mination, whether the wills of moral agents are nece&s;&s;arily determined by an extrin&s;ic, or by an intrin&s;ic cau&s;e, and whether there can be natural liberty without moral, on Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme. This &s;cheme was repre&s;ented as making God the author of &s;in, by plain and direct con&s;equence&mdash;the &s;uppo&s;ed advantage of &s;in to the univer&s;e was briefly noticed; and general ob&s;ervations &amp; reflections &s;ubjoined, with a view to make it manife&s;t, that if no being can, or ever could, chu&s;e or act otherwi&s;e in any ca&s;e, 'tis very immaterial by what name this nece&s;&s;ity is called, &s;ince a nece&s;&s;ity more ab&s;olute cannot be conceived of&mdash;that the runing up mo|ral events, like natural, through a chain of &s;econd cau&s;es to the fir&s;t, is confounding the agency of intelligent crea|tures with mechani&s;m&mdash;making their volitions and conduct the agency of the Deity, properly &s;peaking&mdash;or rather, that, upon the principles of Mr. Edwards, the Deity him|&s;elf is not an agent, but an in&s;trument of nece&s;&s;ity and fate. There is no &s;elf-mover&mdash;direction&mdash;determination, or &s;ource of activity, in the univer&s;e. Wherein our author profe&s;&s;eth him&s;elf a friend of liberty, he either contradicts his own principles, or allows of no liberty that is of any moment, or at all connected with moral agency.</P>
<P>We endeavoured, under the la&s;t branch of our general de&s;ign, to exhibit a &s;cheme more con&s;onant to rea&s;on and truth; &s;hewing from the di&s;cernment that di&s;tingui&s;heth moral agents from the brute-creation, and their capacity of chu&s;ing and acting otherwi&s;e than they in fact do, that internal moral liberty and &s;elf-determination belong to them&mdash;that it no way interferes with this liberty to admit the exhibition and influence of motives in moral volitions.
<PB N="139" REF="012746_0136_0F8BED6AFA4F42E8">
The &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ity exhibited in Mr. Edwards's book, if true in &s;peculation, was, upon the whole, &s;hewn to be fal&s;e in its practical application&mdash;of mo&s;t dangerous ten|dency and con&s;equence. A &s;pecimen was al&s;o annexed of Mr. Edwards's agreeing, in his leading &s;entiments, with antient and modern fatali&s;ts.</P>
<P>This is a view of the &s;ubject &s;o far as it was con&s;idered in our former publication. In the pre&s;ent, the &s;ame gene|ral de&s;ign has been re&s;umed and continued. A further proof of &s;elf-determination hath been adduced from the capacity in moral agents of deliberating, &s;u&s;pending, &amp;c.&mdash; the di&s;tinction of rational agency from animal has been &s;tated&mdash;a di&s;tinction entirely confounded in Mr. Edwards's book, which has been further &s;hewn to contain a full de|nial of moral liberty. It has been argued, that events in the moral world are not <HI>uniform,</HI> as in the material&mdash;that the Deity mu&s;t be the efficient cau&s;e of moral evil, or it hath no &s;uch cau&s;e, unle&s;s &s;elf-determination be admitted&mdash; that motives do not nece&s;&s;itate, nor are the cau&s;e of voliti|on, which hath a moral per&s;on or agent for its cau&s;e. The di&s;tinction of natural and moral nece&s;&s;ity hath been parti|cularly attended to, and, in Mr. Edwards's u&s;e of it, &s;hewn to be groundle&s;s; &s;ince, if he means any thing, a &s;trict and ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity is equally intended by the former as by the latter&mdash;we have touched the argument from the nece&s;&s;i|ty of the divine moral rectitude, and pre&s;ume it was made to appear, that there is no infering herefrom a &s;trict nece&s;|&s;ity in the moral volitions and actions of creatures. From Mr. Edwards's notion of nece&s;&s;ity, it follows, that God is the author or cau&s;e of &s;in, or it hath no cau&s;e. This &s;ame conclu&s;ion has further been &s;hewn to follow from his plan of the origin of evil, which we have di&s;tinctly examined&mdash;a plan which, indeed, renders the exi&s;tence of &s;in forever impo&s;&s;i|ble. His hypothe&s;is, which derives moral evil from the withdraw of divine influence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, has been &s;hewn not to differ materially, either from theirs who explicitly a&s;cribe it to divine efficiency, or from theirs who &s;uppo&s;e God might make creatures originally vicious. The only con&s;i&s;tent hypothe&s;is is that which derives evil from the abu&s;e of moral liberty. The di&s;tinction of the e&s;&s;ence of
<PB N="140" REF="012746_0137_0F8BED6BB8FCBAD8">
virtue and vice from their cau&s;e, has, we flatter our&s;elves, been evinced to be futile and eva&s;ive, by no means to an&s;|wer Mr. Edwards's purpo&s;e, however important he e&s;teem|ed it, and how much &s;oever his principles required it. It has been con&s;idered, whether moral evil is indeed be&s;t for the world; or &s;uppo&s;e it is, whether it be be&s;t that God &s;hould effect it by his agency. We have al&s;o examined the argument from divine pre&s;cience, and particularly &s;hewn, that the certainty of moral events is altogether different from nece&s;&s;ity, the former not affecting their nature, or the manner of their coming to pa&s;s, or any way influencing them, as the latter doth&mdash;that pre&s;cience &s;tands not in the relation of cau&s;e to the things foreknown. Texts of &s;crip|ture u&s;ually alledged in &s;upport of the &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ity have been &s;hewn to be mi&s;con&s;trued. A reply has been made to &s;ome principal objections, and a di&s;&s;ertation ad|ded on metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oning, &s;hewing that it rather &s;erves to bewilder than elucidate the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. We have, therefore, made but little u&s;e of it; although it has in &s;ome mea&s;ure been evinced, (as we &s;uppo&s;e) in the cour&s;e of our examination, that the metaphy&s;ician is ea&s;ily repul&s;ed with his own weapons.</P>
<P>In the examination &s;ome arguments were touched, a|mong many which occur'd, evincing the a&s;pect Mr. Ed|wards's &s;cheme hath on the moral perfections and govern|ment of God, and its con&s;equent practical tendency. O|ther arguments have been now mentioned with the &s;ame view. The oppo&s;ite truth was there exhibited in part; we have now further explain'd our&s;elves, and pur&s;ued the de&s;ign before opened, as far as appeared needful at pre&s;ent. To &s;ave the trouble of repetition, we have &s;everal times re|fered the reader to things &s;aid in the examination.</P>
<P>Our aim has been to attend to the principal point in de|bate, not to dwell on le&s;&s;er and circum&s;tantial things. If the former hath been kept in view, it may be rea&s;onably reque&s;ted, that if any gentleman &s;hall think it needful to publi&s;h remarks on what we have written, he will not make incidental things a principal object of attention. To di|vert his own or the reader's mind from what is mo&s;t mate|rial would be alike inju&s;tice to both, as well as uncandid to
<PB N="141" REF="012746_0138_0F8BED6C7A0B0A10">
the examiner. The main objection to Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme is, that he argues for a nece&s;&s;ity which can be de|fended on this only hypothe&s;is, that God is the cau&s;e of &s;in. To this &s;ingle que&s;tion, the whole controver&s;y is re|ducible. Whoever would defend his book mu&s;t either &s;hew, that the leading principles of it do not &s;uppo&s;e the deity to be the <HI>efficient</HI> of moral evil; or el&s;e that &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition is no reproach to his character and government. We dare affirm he is not the efficient cau&s;e of moral evil; yea, &s;hould we pre&s;ume to affirm that he is this cau&s;e, it would, we doubt not in the lea&s;t, be &s;triking at the founda|tion of all religion.</P>
<P>The pulic attention and candor would now have been a&s;ked no longer, had it not been the opinion of a number of re&s;pectable gentlemen, that we are called upon to take &s;ome notice of the "e&s;&s;ay on moral agency" &amp;c. through which are inter&s;per&s;ed remarks on what we wrote before, and in &s;ome parts of which the author has conde&s;cended more profe&s;&s;edly to attend to the examination.

&s;aith he, it is u&s;ed, neither for volition, nor the cau&s;e of volition; but merely for the external object which doth, or ought to, engage the affection, and ter|minate the choice.&mdash;Thus, <HI>the motives of the go&s;pel</HI> mean <HI>the rea&s;ons exhibited in the go&s;pel,</HI> why men ought to for|&s;ake their &s;ins, and turn unto God. Multitudes have the&s;e rea&s;ons (motives) full in view; and yet utterly refu&s;e and neglect to return.</Q> As &s;uppo&s;e motives of intere&s;t, honor, profit, extant in the mind's view at the &s;ame time with the motives of the go&s;pel; the former govern to the neglect and refu&s;al of the latter. The <HI>inferior</HI> per|ceived motive determines the mind's choice to the rejection of the <HI>&s;uperior.</HI> For are motives "exhibited and full in view," and yet not <HI>apparent</HI> to or <HI>perceived</HI> by the mind to which they are exhibited, and in who&s;e view they &s;tand? If they <HI>are</HI> perceived, then how can it be that the highe&s;t motive always determines volition? Are not tho&s;e motives, which <HI>ought</HI> to govern, highe&s;t, if <HI>full in the view?</HI> Yet <Q>mul|titudes utterly neglect and refu&s;e them.</Q> On the other hand, if they are <HI>not</HI> apparent or perceived, then how are they <HI>exhibited</HI> to, and <HI>full in view</HI> of the mind? how <HI>refu&s;ed</HI> or <HI>neglected?</HI> Mr. We&s;t in&s;i&s;ts, that motives influence the mind only as the mind is in actual motion in the percep|tion of them. But if perception and choice be the &s;ame, how then do motives <HI>influence</HI> volition? how have they a <HI>tendency</HI> to it? Do they influence, have they a tendency, to that which is actually <HI>effected?</HI> After volition has <HI>taken place,</HI> 'tis too late for their influence and tendency. But perhaps what follows may clear up this difficulty: Though <Q>no tendency of motives to volition is perceived and felt, otherwi&s;e than in the <HI>actual taking place and exertion of choice;</HI> yet there is a foundation in the na|ture of things, ari&s;ing from &s;ome certain quality in ob|jects, and from the particular &s;tate, temper and com|plexion of the mind, for their being cho&s;en as &s;oon as they &s;hall come into the view of the mind.</Q> (The rea|der will remember he had ju&s;t been &s;peaking of motives <HI>full in view, but utterly refu&s;ed.</HI>) Apply this to the evan|gelical motives to repentance. With re&s;pect to tho&s;e who&s;e "&s;tate, temper and complexion of mind," antecedently
<PB N="147" REF="012746_0144_0F8BED7282631968">
corre&s;pond to the&s;e motives, they have a tendency to lead to repentance: But with re&s;pect to tho&s;e in whom there is not this antecedent corre&s;pondence of temper, they have not this tendency in the lea&s;t. There is no founda|tion for a tendency in go&s;pel motives to engage men's choice, unle&s;s the &s;tate and temper of their minds corre&s;|pond to the&s;e motives, antecedent to the exhibition of them. Now will Mr. We&s;t &s;ay, that there is this corre&s;|pondence of temper in any <HI>unregenerate</HI> per&s;on? We tru&s;t he will not. The con&s;equence will then be, that <HI>that</HI> change, which the go&s;pel hath a tendency and is de&s;igned to produce in men, mu&s;t be actually effected before it's motives are exhibited&mdash;the end mu&s;t be accompli&s;hed be|fore the means are applied&mdash;&s;inners mu&s;t for&s;ake their &s;ins and turn to God, and then the go&s;pel motives will have a tendency to lead them to repentance; but not be|fore. The go&s;pel then is no tender to the unregenerate. And if not to them, who are tho&s;e "multitudes" to whom its motives are exhibited, and who "utterly refu&s;e and neglect" them, though "full in their view?"</P>
<P>Such a notion of tendency and influence in motives is very &s;ingular. When did any writer before Mr. We&s;t ever u&s;e the term motives in this &s;en&s;e? that the thing motives are de&s;igned to engage to mu&s;t be effected before the exibition and perception of them? that motives obtain this appellation from the mind's being in actual motion? that motives full in view are utterly neglected and refu&s;ed? We are quite content the public &s;hould judge, whether Mr. We&s;t's attempt to reconcile Mr. Edwards with him|&s;elf has removed the appearance of incon&s;i&s;tency and ab|&s;urdity, or hath not rather confu&s;ed and jumbled &s;till more the &s;ubject of the determination of the will by mo|tives. In what &s;en&s;e the influence of motives in moral vo|litions may be admitted, we have endeavoured to &s;hew Part III. &s;ect. 2. of the examination, and &s;ection 2d. of the pre&s;ent continuation thereof.</P>
<P>P. 24; 76,&mdash;79. Quotations are made in abundance from the examiner to prove him gro&s;sly incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, and that he hath given in ample te&s;timony to the truth of the doctrine he oppo&s;eth. Had Mr. We&s;t <Q>pro|perly
<PB N="148" REF="012746_0145_0F8BED733AA4E0E0">
con&s;idered</Q> that at p. 92. he quotes the examiner as admitting, that every moral event mu&s;t have a cau&s;e, and &s;aying, that moral agents are the cau&s;es of their own actions, he would not, perhaps, have given him&s;elf the trou|ble to copy &s;o much from the examination. We do main|tain that the &s;ubjects of moral volitions are al&s;o the cau&s;e of their own volitions. This is a different thing from &s;ay|ing, that volition is its own cau&s;e. The di&s;tinction between the terms volition and agent is plain. Agents determine them&s;elves; we &s;ay not that the properties or actions of agents are &s;elf-determined&mdash;that volition, which is already become effect, is the cau&s;e of it's own exi&s;tence. Mr. We&s;t had no occa&s;ion to repre&s;ent the examiner's doctrine in this light. And though he &s;uppo&s;eth that an enquiry in|to the cau&s;e of volition belongs not to the &s;ubject of moral agency, yet we pre&s;ume enough hath been &s;aid, particularly in the 5th &s;ection, to &s;hew that it doth. In the &s;ame part of Mr. We&s;t's e&s;&s;ay, the examiner is cen&s;ured pretty &s;e|verely for not allowing more weight to a particular di&s;|tinction of Mr. Edwards's, and treating it with contempt. "Upon a review of the matter," Mr. We&s;t <Q>thinks the examiner him&s;elf will be convinced that he hath not herein done ju&s;tice to Mr. Edwards.</Q></P>
<P>The examiner hath "reviewed the matter," and is "convinced" of no other "inju&s;tice herein done" by him "to Mr. Edwards," than that he did not &s;ufficiently ex|po&s;e the weakne&s;s of the di&s;tinction refered to. While he a&s;ks pardon for this omi&s;&s;ion, he hopes he has made &s;ome atonement for it by taking the trouble to write an whole &s;ection profe&s;&s;edly on the point. Herein he hath al&s;o an&s;|wered to another exception of Mr. We&s;t's a few lines below on the &s;ame page; (p. 83.) and in his turn mu&s;t fault Mr. We&s;t for an unfair repre&s;entation of him. The reader by turning to the page in the examination, which Mr. We&s;t refers to, will &s;ee the repre&s;entation is partial.</P>
<P>In what Mr. We&s;t hath offered, in divers parts of his e&s;&s;ay, in a critical way, on the antecedent &s;tate of the mind and volition, he appears &s;low in under&s;tanding the exami|ner, and doth not repre&s;ent him to &s;uch advantage as might have been done con&s;i&s;tently enough with &s;ound critici&s;m.</P>

We were, indeed, far from &s;uppo&s;ing that this <HI>alone</HI> proved it fal&s;e. At the &s;ame time we knew, that the doctrine of the old fatali&s;ts was as generally rejected among Chri&s;tians, as the principles of <HI>Bellarmine</HI> among prote&s;tants&mdash;and &s;uppo&s;ed on as good rea&s;ons. It was, therefore, thought it might be taken for granted, that Mr. Edwards's foundation principle being &s;hewn to coincide with the fatality of the heathen, would be &s;ufficient with all Chri&s;tians for it's being reject|ed: Nor have we any &s;cruple, but Mr. We&s;t's attempt to vindicate it will &s;erve the good purpo&s;e of bringing it into ju&s;t abhorrence.</P>
<P>We are, upon the whole, by no means compelled to grant, that we have mi&s;repre&s;ented Mr. Edwards in any of the things laid to our charge.

That it is the duty of the unregenerate to for&s;ake their &s;ins&mdash;that they have no excu&s;e for making any delay in turning to God&mdash;that they are obliged to love him with all their heart&mdash;and con&s;equently to act from <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>&s;piritual</HI> principles they are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, or endowed with, the examiner fully believes, nor hath he ever denied. If it <Q>was not with de&s;ign, but wholly for want of under|&s;tanding what the opinion and real &s;entiment</Q> of the examiner is, that Mr. We&s;t hath &s;o gro&s;sly "mi&s;repre|&s;ented" him, he can ea&s;ily forgive this wrong: But it is not &s;o ea&s;y to &s;ee how Mr. We&s;t can forgive him&s;elf, if he hath thus "perverted" the examiner's <Q>meaning, and wre&s;ted his words from their plain and obvious im|port, de&s;ignedly, by forced and unnatural con&s;truction&mdash;having no other end in view than to rai&s;e the popular cry again&s;t him, and ca&s;t an odium upon his &s;entiments and character.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface p. 9.

<P>Mr. We&s;t frequently faults the examiner for not particularly replying to &s;ome peculiar arguments of Mr. Edwards's.

<P>Mr. We&s;t hath pretermitted many material difficulties the examiner had noticed in Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme. <HI>The whole fir&s;t part</HI> of the examination is unnoticed, and im|plicitly confirmed, by him.

&s;hew, that if Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme be true in &s;peculation, it is not applicable to <HI>practice.</HI> But very few things in the other parts of the examination are remarked upon, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e that are, much mi&s;repre&s;ented. If it would not be too touch <HI>vanity,</HI> the examiner would con&s;true Mr. We&s;t's pretermi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome things as a tacit approbation of them. But he calls to mind, that <Q>a vindication of Mr. Edwards was not &s;o particularly in</Q> Mr. We&s;t's "view." And wherein he has mi&s;under&s;tood or mi&s;repre|&s;ented the examiner, the latter might be &s;o unhappy as not to expre&s;s his &s;entiments with preci&s;ion and per&s;picuity. It was far from any &s;light of the examiner's performance, that Mr. We&s;t omitted to remark on the greater and <HI>princi|pal</HI> part of it. He hath admitted the examiner's chief ob|jection to Mr. Edwards's book, which is more generous than was even expected.</P>
<P>The objection refered to is, that Mr. Edwards's doc|trine makes God the cau&s;e of &s;in. This Mr. We&s;t admits, and &s;ets him&s;elf to prove that there is no weight in it. The examiner was fully per&s;uaded that this was the clear con|&s;equence of Mr. Edwards's doctrine, and imagined that whenever it was made to appear, the advocates for the doc|trine among <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> would immediately renounce it. He little expected that the con&s;equence would be adopted as a principle, and an attempt made to defend it, by any one of Mr. Edwards's friends. He hath the &s;atisfaction to find, that many worthy gentlemen, who have thought favour|ably of Mr. Edwards's book, expre&s;s much di&s;approbati|on of Mr. We&s;t's performance. Nor is the examiner without hopes, that what Mr. We&s;t hath wrote may an&s;wer the good end of bringing into ju&s;t di&s;credit the doctrine for which he hath appeared as an advocate.</P>
<P>Moral and Chri&s;tian writers hitherto have cho&s;en to &s;ay, that God <HI>permits</HI> or <HI>&s;uffers</HI> moral evil.

And was no more re&s;pect due to the public, who&s;e candor was a&s;ked! No more to the republic of letters in particular! No more to wi&s;e and good men of all denominations!

If there be a God and moral gover|nor, may we not take this one "principle upon tru&s;t," that he is not the cau&s;e of &s;in?</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="012746_0158_0F8BED7E85EBD6B0">The point in which all Mr. We&s;t's arguments meet&mdash;which he takes for granted through the fir&s;t part of his e&s;|&s;ay, and &s;ets him&s;elf to defend in the &s;econd, is, the divine agency and efficiency in &s;in. Mr. Edwards would not ad|mit this was a con&s;equence from his doctrine. And many may be ready to think, that, in repre&s;enting Mr. Edwards in this light, Mr. We&s;t hath done greater inju&s;tice to that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> divine, than any he chargeth the examiner with. In truth, when Mr. We&s;t &s;aw that Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme concluded in this, he ought at once to have renounced a doctrine &s;o reproachful to his maker. LET GOD BE TRUE, AND EVERY MAN A LYAR. A direct denial of the God that is above would not be a greater grief and offence to mo&s;t intelligent and &s;erious Chri&s;tians, than this doctrine of his <HI>cau&s;ality</HI> in moral evil. They e&s;teem the a&s;&s;ertion bla&s;phemous. Mr. We&s;t, doubtle&s;s, views the matter in a very different light. But is it not a&s;toni&s;hing that any di&s;cerning, &s;erious per&s;on &s;hould a&s;&s;ert peremptorily, and with great uncharitablene&s;s too towards tho&s;e who differ from him, what is a&s;&s;erted, and often repeated, in his e&s;&s;ay! Had he been humble and mode&s;t, would he not have been more fearful lea&s;t he &s;hould publi&s;h things incon&s;i&s;tent with divine moral rectitude? In the leading &s;entiment of his e&s;&s;ay, we have no other controver&s;y with him than all the Chri&s;tians in the world have&mdash;no other than all &s;ober, con&s;i&s;tent thei&s;ts have.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian's bible in&s;tructs him, that the <HI>new man</HI> is God's creation: But he never learnt from it, that the <HI>old man,</HI> with his deeds, is &s;o. It in&s;tructs him, that the &s;on of God was manife&s;ted to de&s;troy the works of the <HI>devil;</HI> not that he came to de&s;troy the works of GOD&mdash;or that the works of the devil are the product of divine agency. It in&s;tructs him, that Je&s;us the &s;on of God came to &s;ave his people from their <HI>&s;ins;</HI> not that his de&s;ign was to &s;ave them from the effects of the <HI>divine influence</HI> and <HI>operation</HI> upon them. His bible in&s;tructs the Chri&s;tian, that it is God who worketh in us to will and to do that which is <HI>good;</HI> not that he worketh in us to will and to do that which is <HI>&s;inful</HI> and contrary to his holy nature and law. The latter is expre&s;&s;|ly a&s;cribed to the &s;pirit which is in the world, in contradi&s;|tinction

from the &s;pirit which is in good men. (The &s;pi|rit that worketh in the children of di&s;obedience is not, however, the proper <HI>efficient</HI> of their wickedne&s;s, he only &s;olliciteth them to it. For every man is then tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lu&s;t, and enticed.) The Chri&s;tian learns from his bible, that God <HI>cannot be tempted with evil,</HI> and that <HI>he tempteth no man;</HI> not that every act of &s;in is to be re&s;olved into his <HI>productive influence.</HI></P>
<Q>&rindx;WE may &s;uppo&s;e a reader of Mr. We&s;t's e&s;&s;ay, to addre&s;s him thus: I admit, &s;ir, your po&s;ition of the divine agency or efficiency in &s;in. You have clearly e&s;tabli&s;hed it. But I deny that <HI>that</HI> being, whom you make the only cau&s;e of moral evil, is holy, ju&s;t and good. I demand a proof of his moral per|fections, on your principles. My bible, indeed, tells me, that God is holy, and commands me to be holy for this rea&s;on. But I deny the principle laid down. It &s;hould have been, I the Lord your God am unho|ly; and then the injunction would have &s;tood thus, Be ye al&s;o unholy. If I rea&s;on wrong, pray &s;et me right&mdash;and as you have made me a pro&s;elyte to your hypothe&s;is, &s;hew me, if po&s;&s;ible, that God is holy, notwith&s;tanding his &s;uppo&s;ed efficiency in &s;in.</Q>
<P>The fatality of the heathen is really le&s;s abhorrent than Mr. We&s;t's opinion of the divine efficiency in moral evil. They "fancied that <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and all the gods, were oblig|ed to &s;ubmit to fate, which was to be controuled by no power whatever. The <HI>Stoics</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed that the untracta|blene&s;s of matter was the cau&s;e of evil; that God would have made all things perfect, but an evil bias in matter, re|pugnant to his benevolence," prevented, "whence aro&s;e all manner of evil." This has &s;ome appearance of re&s;pect to the divine moral character: But Mr. We&s;t's opinion robs the deity of this character, even in appearance, as well as in reality. When &s;uch things are publi&s;hed as "plain, im|portant, evangelical truths," what &s;hall we &s;ay? Doth the publi&s;her really de&s;ire to have the foundations, even of na|tural religion, laid again? Were an avowed ATHEIST to
<PB N="163" REF="012746_0160_0F8BED81AAF07268">
a&s;&s;ert them, we &s;hould tell him he belied the perceptions and operations of his own mind, as well as tho&s;e of all mankind.</P>
<P>There appears the &s;ame "air of peremptorine&s;s" in what Mr. We&s;t hath wrote on divine foreknowledge. The two fir&s;t pages of his preface manife&s;t this. We only ob|&s;erve, that he repre&s;ents tho&s;e who profe&s;s to believe di|vine pre&s;cience and human liberty, and &s;till &s;uppo&s;e that an <HI>human</HI> intellect cannot reconcile them together, as main|taining that they are <HI>irreconcileable</HI> and <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent</HI> with each other. Let an in&s;tance be produced in &s;upport of this. We know not a &s;ingle writer who maintains that pre&s;cience and liberty are incon&s;i&s;tent, profe&s;&s;ing at the &s;ame time a full belief of both. There is a plain difference between a per&s;on's &s;aying that <HI>he</HI> cannot reconcile them, yea, that no <HI>human</HI> under&s;tanding can; and &s;aying, they are <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> irreconcileable and incon&s;i&s;tent. If Mr. We&s;t doth not di&s;cern a difference, he may po&s;&s;ibly find that wi&s;er men do, if he will be at the trouble to turn to the &s;ection on foreknowledge&mdash;to which we al&s;o refer him, together with the 4th. 5th. 8th. and 9th. &s;ections, for the nece&s;&s;ary ob&s;er|vations on the merits of his opinion concerning the divine agency in moral evil.</P>
<P>P. 103, 104. he &s;aith, that the examiner's &s;cheme <HI>"con|fe&s;&s;edly"</HI> involved this difficulty, that pre&s;cience cannot be reconciled with liberty&mdash;(di&s;tingui&s;hing this word by a dif|ferent type, as we have done.) If the examiner hath <HI>con|fe&s;&s;ed</HI> this&mdash;or if it can, by plain implication, be &s;hewn to be contained in any thing he hath publi&s;hed, he will im|mediately retract it, as contrary to his own principles and common &s;en&s;e. Mr. We&s;t be&s;t knows whether he <Q>de|&s;ignedly mi&s;under&s;tood or perverted</Q> the examiner's "meaning." But after having repre&s;ented him to the public as <HI>confe&s;&s;ing</HI> what cannot be fixed upon him by <HI>im|plication,</HI> Mr. We&s;t &s;hould not have taken occa&s;ion to tri|umph over him as chargeable with the mo&s;t palpable "im|propriety," and incapable of being impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of it. This is &s;omewhat extraordinary. Mr. We&s;t will de&s;erve pity, if this intimation doth not make "a deeper impre&s;&s;ion on his mind," than what he hath wrote in the
<PB N="164" REF="012746_0161_0F8BED82396E7BF0">
pages la&s;t refered to hath made on the examiner&mdash;and an impre&s;&s;ion of a quite different kind. By turning to the place, the reader may at once judge, whether the exami|ner's words contain the <HI>confe&s;&s;ion</HI> a&s;cribed to him.</P>
<P>In reply to Mr. We&s;t's hypothe&s;is, part II. &s;ect, 1, 2; 4. re&s;pecting the de&s;irablene&s;s of moral evil, and its being a nece&s;&s;ary means of effecting the greate&s;t good, we refer him to the &s;ixth &s;ection we have now publi&s;hed. He will, perhaps, find it a difficult ta&s;k to prove, that an holy God creates vicious di&s;po&s;itions in multitudes, that they may be fit objects of eternal puni&s;hment, as a means of mani|fe&s;ting his glorious name, in their perdition, to a few ve&s;|&s;els of mercy: In other words, that the wickedne&s;s and puni&s;hment of infernals is what &s;ecures the holine&s;s and happine&s;s of &s;aints and angels; and that with this view God effects their wickedne&s;s, that he may inflict their puni&s;hment. What warrant hath Mr. We&s;t, or any man, to &s;ay, that&punc; had not moral evil exi&s;ted, the governor of the world could not have exhibited his hatred of &s;in, his love of holine&s;s, his goodne&s;s and authority illu&s;triou&s;ly in <HI>other</HI> ways? Has the authority and dominion of Jehovah its foundation or &s;ecurity in &s;in?</P>
<P>Mr. We&s;t hath undertaken to make a compari&s;on be|tween a &s;y&s;tem <HI>without</HI> &s;in, and one <HI>with</HI> it. Can he then clearly di&s;cern what would have been, had &s;in never entred the world? in a &s;y&s;tem in which univer&s;al holine&s;s &s;hould prevail? If he doth not &s;uppo&s;e he can, why doth he make his compari&s;on, when he had ju&s;t before <Q>acknowledged, that where the objects between which a compari&s;on is to be made are not <HI>both in view,</HI> we cannot judge of them by way of compari&s;on?</Q> (P. 173.) Are the things he hath &s;aid on the <HI>preferablene&s;s</HI> and <HI>de&s;ireablene&s;s</HI> of moral evil "certainly manife&s;t and &s;elf-evident truths?" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 195.</NOTE> And mu&s;t it argue "prejudice, &s;ourne&s;s and bitterne&s;s" to reject them? How came Mr. We&s;t by his deci&s;ive knowledge in the&s;e high matters! WHO is <HI>prejudiced, &s;our,</HI> and <HI>bitter!</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Preface p. 6, 7.</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>The grand pillars of Mr. Edwards's doctrine &s;tand firm and un&s;haken,</Q> in Mr. We&s;t's opinions <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pref. p. 8, 9.</NOTE> notwith|&s;tanding what the examiner before publi&s;hed. If the doc|trine
<PB N="165" REF="012746_0162_0F8BED82F85FF608">
really terminates in the leading &s;entiment of Mr. We&s;t's e&s;&s;ay, let the intelligent judge whether its grand pil|lars <HI>&s;tand &s;trong.</HI> In truth, the examiner thinks, that what Mr. We&s;t hath wrote hath &s;haken them more than his own examination of the doctrine. It &s;eems to be now conced|ed, that Mr. Edwards's &s;cheme makes God the efficient cau&s;e of &s;in. If this be his doctrine, few &s;en&s;ible, &s;erious per&s;ons will think there is occa&s;ion to proceed any further. It was the <HI>foundation</HI> which was propo&s;ed to be examined. Let rea&s;on and religion &s;ay, whether this be not &s;ubverted, if it hath no other bottom than a &s;uppo&s;ed divine cau&s;ality in moral evil. If we may not be confident in the contrary &s;entiment, we may not be of any thing. We cannot de|termine any doctrine by the bible, on this hypothe&s;is. For if God may be the cau&s;e of wickedne&s;s, he may deceive us. How then can we have any dependance on his word?</P>
<P>Though Mr. We&s;t could not "<HI>ju&s;tly</HI> expect" a <HI>particu|lar</HI> "an&s;wer to" his own "rea&s;onings," <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 254.</NOTE> con&s;idering the nature and &s;pirit of his performance; yet he may po&s;&s;ibly find, either in the proceeding <HI>&s;trictures,</HI> or in the <HI>continuation</HI> of the examination, that mo&s;t of the things he hath offered in a way of <HI>argument</HI> have had &s;ome attention paid them&mdash;at lea&s;t the mo&s;t <HI>material. Per&s;onal</HI> things have had very little notice: They ought not to have been introduced into the debate. The examiner tru&s;ts the public will think he has &s;ufficiently vindicated him&s;elf from &s;ome ex|ceptions and mi&s;repre&s;entations of Mr. We&s;t's; and, if he hath "in any thing corrected him," <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pref. to e&s;&s;ay, p. 9.</NOTE> that it hath been done without reviling: For he would not be found <HI>beating his fellow-&s;ervant.</HI> <Q>Many things, which appeared to be exceptionable, have been pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed;</Q> &s;ince they all meet in one capital error.</P>
<P>But after boldly advancing this doctrine, that all man|ner of &s;in and bla&s;phemy is the effect of God's action on the creature, may we not well marvel to find him (in te&s;ti|mony of his zeal and valor for the truth) bringing an ac|cu&s;ation again&s;t tho&s;e who di&s;believe it, as &s;eting them&s;elves again&s;t the doctrines of Calvini&s;m and of grace&mdash;pluming him&s;elf on the &s;uppo&s;ition of his being an advocate for
<PB N="166" REF="012746_0163_0F8BED83C2F17AA0">
the&s;e doctrines! Do Calvini&s;ts deny original righteou&s;|ne&s;s? Do they &s;ay, that the pre&s;ent impotency of man|kind is not the penal con&s;equence of the fall as its &s;ource, and is only <HI>moral,</HI> not <HI>natural?</HI> Do Calvini&s;ts a&s;&s;ert the divine efficiency in &s;in? Let the intelligent judge whether Mr. We&s;t is a Calvini&s;t. The que&s;tion, however, is not, what is Calvini&s;m? but, what is truth? What &s;aith the &s;cripture? As to the doctrines of grace, <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> divines have generally accounted them &s;uch as the&s;e&mdash;The atone|ment of the mediator; ju&s;tification by faith in it; the effica|cy of repentance to procure pardon through the redempti|on in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; the promi&s;e of divine aids, of peace with God, and of eternal life, through the &s;ame mediator. If by the doctrines of grace Mr. We&s;t means any thing contrary to the&s;e, let him explain him&s;elf.</P>
<P>We cannot conclude without renewed expre&s;&s;ions of our a&s;toni&s;hment, that a gentleman who is <HI>&s;et for the defence of the go&s;pel,</HI> (and we pre&s;ume really believes it) &s;hould pub|li&s;h &s;o glaring a perver&s;ion of it, (as many things contain'd in the e&s;&s;ay evidently are) in&s;tead of manife&s;ting the truth as it is in Je&s;us. It reminds us of St. Paul's addre&s;s to the Galatians, <HI>Who hath bewitched you!</HI> If this be not to <HI>preach another go&s;pel,</HI> 'tis difficult to &s;ay what is. <HI>We can do nothing again&s;t the truth, but for the truth:</HI> Which words, while expe&s;&s;ive of the duty of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter, are a cau|tion to him to <HI>take heed to his doctrine,</HI> that he be not in|&s;trumental in <HI>corrupting</HI> mens <HI>minds from the &s;implicity that is in Chri&s;t</HI>&mdash;To take heed, <HI>le&s;t haply he be found</HI> TO FIGHT AGAINST GOD. 'Tis a cheap &s;acrifice to give up any hy|pothe&s;is to the honor of THE TRUTH AS IT IS IN JESUS; But a dreadful thing to CORRUPT THE WORD OF GOD.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are employed to <HI>&s;pread the &s;avor of the</HI> RE|DEEMER'S name, and to addre&s;s mankind <HI>in the fulne&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ing of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t;</HI> who&s;e incumbent Duty it is to <HI>u&s;e great plainne&s;s of &s;peech;</HI> &s;hould account a reputa|tion for &s;kill in <HI>metaphy&s;ical</HI> di&s;qui&s;itions unworthy their emulation.</P>
<P>Mr. We&s;t's &s;cheme, on bare propo&s;al, &s;trikes an intel|ligent and devout mind with horror. It carries its own refutation. It is a palpable reproach to God, and repug|nant
<PB N="167" REF="012746_0164_0F8BED847A1E0570">
to every ju&s;t idea of religion. No &s;uppo&s;eable con&s;e|quences can be more &s;hocking than the naked doctrine it|&s;elf; on the footing of which there is no moral agency and accountablene&s;s, no moral governor, no righteous judgment. He ought to be with&s;tood to the face, as one who hath &s;poken wickedly for God&mdash;(though we tru&s;t from prejudice and mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, not from wilful en|mity to the truth.) We mean not to accu&s;e him of any <HI>de&s;igned</HI> perver&s;ion of the doctrines of revelation. We wi&s;h he may &s;ee his error, as we are per&s;uaded it is very great. Should he be convinced of it, we doubt not but he will be ingenuous enough to acknowledge it, in honor both to him&s;elf and the truth.</P>
<P>When impious tenets are publickly advanced, a vindi|cation of the divine character forbids us to be unconcern'd. If any things we have &s;aid towards the clo&s;e of the&s;e &s;tric|tures &s;hould have the appearance of <HI>&s;everity, that</HI> &s;everity hath not the <HI>per&s;on,</HI> but the <HI>opinions</HI> of our author for its object&mdash;opinions to which too &s;trong a di&s;like cannot be expre&s;&s;ed&mdash;We have, at the &s;ame time, aimed to keep in mind the apo&s;tolic advice, <HI>In meekne&s;s in&s;tructing tho&s;e that oppo&s;e them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>We can heartily join in <Q>committing the cau&s;e to him who judgeth righteous judgment.</Q></P>
