<P>I Shall not now &s;pend my time in inquir|ing who <HI>Job</HI> was, in what time, and where he lived. Let two or three things be ob&s;erved of him. (1.) That he was a very good Man, and had as he de|&s;erved a high Character and Commendation be&s;towed upon him. He was <HI>perfect and up|right,</HI> one <HI>that feared God and e&s;chewed evil.</HI> (2.) Ob&s;erve that this good Man met with heavy Afflictions, of which we have a Ca|talogue in this Chapter, ver. 14, 15. <HI>There c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a me&s;&s;enger unto Job, and &s;aid, the Oxen were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lowing, and the A&s;&s;es feeding be&s;ide them; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Sabeans fell upon them, &amp; took them away; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ey have &s;lain the Servants with the edge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;word, and I only am e&s;caped to tell</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ver. 16. <HI>While he was yet &s;peaking, there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l&s;o another, and &s;aid, the fire of God is

The la&s;t of which was the heavie&s;t and greate&s;t of all.

<P>WE &s;ee this in the Example of <HI>Job,</HI> and in &s;everal others of God's dear Children who&s;e Names are on record in the &s;acred Pages. Never was there a Per&s;on &s;o near and dear to God as the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was, yet he was a <HI>Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief.</HI> Now this teaches us not to judge of Men's Conditions, that they don't belong to God, becau&s;e of their pre&s;ent &s;orrowful Vi&s;itations. We mu&s;t judge of Per&s;ons by their Conver&s;ation towards God, not by God's Di&s;pen&s;ations towards them. The greate&s;t Sufferers are not always the great|e&s;t Sinners. Luk. 13.2, 3. <HI>And Je&s;us an&s;|wered, and &s;aid unto them, Suppo&s;e ye that the&s;e Galileans were &s;inners above all the Gali|leans, becau&s;e they &s;uffered &s;uch things?

Indeed, to be exce&s;&s;ively de|jected, and ca&s;t down under Afflictions, &s;o as to impair our Health, and incapacitate us for the Duties either of our particular or general Calling, is what Chri&s;tians &s;hould endeavour again&s;t, and earne&s;tly beg Grace of God to overcome. The Exhortation is, <HI>My &s;on, faint not when thou art rebuked of him,</HI> Heb. 12.5.

To &s;ee Men merry and jocund, when God is angry, or to &s;et light by his Corrections. I&s;ai. 22.12, 13, 14. <HI>And in that day did the Lord God of ho&s;ts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to boldne&s;s, and to girding with &s;ackcloth; and behold joy and gladne&s;s, &s;laying Oxen, and killing Sheep eat-fle&s;h, and drinking wine; Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we &s;hall die. And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of ho&s;ts, &s;urely this iniquity &s;hall not be purged from you, till ye die &s;aith the Lord God of ho&s;ts.</HI> Surely, the di&s;plea&s;ure of God in Afflictions and Judg|ments, ought to be laid to Heart. Is it a &s;mall matter to have God's frowns and di&s;|plea&s;ure? Amos 3.6. <HI>Shall a trumpet be blown in the City, and the people not be afraid? &s;hall there be evil in a City and the Lord hath not done it?</HI> When <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was a &s;uitor for his &s;i&s;ter <HI>Miriam,</HI> he received this An&s;wer from the Lord, Numb. 12.24. <HI>If her father had pit in her face, &s;hould &s;he not have been a&s;ha|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed &s;even days?</HI> The face is the Table and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> eat of beauty and honour; but when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">it upon it is made the &s;ink of Shame. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ad her own Father &s;pit upon her Face,

<P N="1">(1.) <HI>THE genuine Effect of Affliction is Faith in God. I have heard of thee</HI> (&s;aith <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b</HI>) <HI>by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye &s;eeth thee,</HI> Chap. 42.5. In Trouble and Di&s;tre&s;s, the Eye of Faith is opened and cleared, &s;o that the Man is able to behold tho&s;e Things which he could not di&s;cern by the Eye of Sen&s;e and common Apprehen&s;ion. Now God's People arrive to a firm and stea|dy Belief of the Promi&s;es. We now em|brace them when we &s;tand in need of them. We confide in Je&s;us the Author of them, and re&s;t our Souls upon him, as our only &s;up|port. When all outward Enjoyments are with-drawn, then by Faith we take a pro&s;|pect of Heaven and Happine&s;s, and tho&s;e eternal <HI>Plea&s;ures which are at God's right hand.</HI> This we &s;ee in <HI>David,</HI> he was taught to fly unto God, and tru&s;t in him, in the Day of Di&s;tre&s;s and Calamity, and never

did his humble Confidence ri&s;e to the high|e&s;t Pitch, till he was brought low, &amp; worn out with Trouble and Mi&s;ery; as we may ob&s;erve in his excellent P&s;alms.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>REPENTANCE is another fruit of that Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is the product of Affliction.</HI> Therefore we may ob&s;erve, that it immedi|ately follows in that above-cited Chapter of <HI>Job,</HI> ver. 6. <HI>I abbor my &s;elf and repent in dust and a&s;hes.</HI> With Faith is joined true Repentance, and both are the ble&s;&s;ed fruits of &s;anctified Troubles. When <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> was in Fetters and Chains, then he humbled him&s;elf for his Idolatry, and other gro&s;s Offences, and turned unto the Lord.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>A Spirit of Prayer and Supplication is another fruit of Affliction.</HI> I&s;ai. 26.9. <HI>With my &s;pirit within me, will I &s;eek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inha|bitants of the world will learn righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Ho&s;. 5.15. <HI>In their affliction they will &s;eek me early.</HI> P&s;al. 130.1, 2. <HI>Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord!

&s;ee in holy David, P&s;al. 116.3, &amp;c. <HI>The &s;or|rows of death compa&s;&s;ed me, the pains of hell gat hold upon me, I found trouble &amp; &s;orrow: Then called I upon the name of the Lord, O Lord I be&s;eech thee deliver my &s;oul.</HI> And tho&s;e of his P&s;alms which are mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of his devotion, and compo&s;ed of earne&s;t petitions and &s;upplications, were indited when he was in great trouble and di&s;tre&s;s. It's this adver&s;e and afflictive &s;tate, that hath extorted prayer from the mo&s;t profligate Sinners. Particularly it is recorded of <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh,</HI> that when he was <HI>among the thorns, and bound in fetters, he be&s;ought the Lord his God, and prayed unto him,</HI> 2 Chron. 33.11, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) <HI>THE next Grace which Affliction is very &s;erviceable to promote, is Humility.</HI> It's the wi&s;e de&s;ign of Providence to exerci&s;e Men with Afflictions, that they may learn not to be proud and pre&s;umptuous. <HI>David</HI> &s;aid in his <HI>pro&s;perity, I &s;hall never be moved,</HI> P&s;al. 30.6. which is the language of pride and &s;elf confidence: but it follows, <HI>Thou did&s;t hide thy face, and I was troubled.</HI> His pro&s;perous &s;tate was changed into another of a quite different nature: which was very well for him, to check the growing In&s;olence of his &s;pirit. It is particularly, recorded of <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> whom I mentioned before, that
<PB N="16" REF="002545_0017_0FDB46B6CED8EB28">
<HI>when he was in affliction, he humbled him&s;elf greatly before the God of his fathers,</HI> 2 Chron. 33.12.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) <HI>HEAVENLY MINDEDNESS is great|ly promoted by Afflictions.</HI> The&s;e make us pant after a better &s;tate: the&s;e make us cry out with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>Wo is me, that I &s;oj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urn in Me&s;ech,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>O that I had the wings of a dove, that I might flee away, and be at rest!

<P N="3">[3dly,] and la&s;tly. ANOTHER Spiritual advantage which attends Affliction when &s;anctified, is <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y and Comfort.</HI> As the Suf|ferings of Chri&s;t abound in us, &s;ays the A|po&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> &s;o <HI>our Con&s;olation aboundeth by Chri&s;t,</HI> 2 Cor. 1.5.

The&s;e &s;ome have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound, when their Children have been cut off from them, and that in &s;o eminent a degree, that they have little valued their comfort in Children, in compari&s;on of this Comfort. I have read of an holy Man, who one day after a &s;harp Tryal, having his only Son &s;uddenly taken away by Death, re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed alone for &s;everal hours; and when he came forth did look

<P>SINCE then it is &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing, you &s;hould not pray for it coldly, but &s;ervently, importunately. So pray and there is Hopes, that you will obtain. God is a God hearing of Prayer.

Such a Gift as we are now &s;peaking of, was always meant to be &s;ought and obtained by Prayer.</P>
