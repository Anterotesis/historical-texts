<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT was far from the Author's Intention or De&s;ire, to appear in Print upon this Subject. The earne&s;t Importunity of a con&s;iderable Number of Clergymen, for whom he has great Re&s;pect, and who were pre&s;ent at the Delivery of the Di&s;cour&s;e, was the only Thing that made him con&s;ent. Diffident of his own Judgment, he has ventured on theirs. As to the Stile and Manner, he makes no Apology, more than for the Appearance of his Per&s;on; it is &s;uch as is natural to him. Yet &s;o much with Ju&s;tice he may &s;ay, that when he wrote it, he did not dream but that it was fated, with innumerable more, to lie and moulder in the Oblivion of his own De&s;k.</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>MAT. V. 23, 24.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Therefore if thou bring thy Gift to the Altar, and there remembre&s;t that thy Brother hath aught again&s;t thee; leave there thy Gift before the Altar, and go thy Way; fir&s;t be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy Gift.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_AS Ignorance and Inattention is often apt to mi&s;apply Texts of Scripture, &s;o an evil Temper is ever ready to catch at any Plea that may &s;eem to warrant the Neglect of Go&s;pel Ordi|nances: It is therefore the undoubted Duty of Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, to vindicate every Part of the &s;acred Record from Abu&s;e, and as much as po&s;&s;ible, to prevent Men from turning into Poi&s;on that which was de&s;igned for their Nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>The Words which I have read in your Ears, are &s;ome of the Number which require our Attention, to prevent a Mi&s;improvement of them, to the Hurt of many. I take this Opportunity therefore to call your Attention to a calm Con&s;ideration of their true Intent and Meaning.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="011491_0003_0F8331365D0C2840">To view them in their Connections, and to &s;hew you their Import as relating to the Jews, &s;hall be our fir&s;t Part.</P>
<P>An Application to Chri&s;tians, &s;hall be our Second.</P>
<P>To point out the Abu&s;es to which the&s;e Words are liable, we &s;hall endeavour in the la&s;t Place.</P>
<P N="1">I. If you con&s;ider the Connection of the&s;e Words, you find they make a Part of that a&s;toni&s;hing Sermon which the Son of God preached to his Di&s;ciples on the Mount. A Sermon, in which he &s;eems wholly to aim at overthrowing the Corruptions of human Nature, and particularly to knock down the ba&s;e Props of them which the wicked Phari&s;ees had &s;et up under Colour of the Law. He begins by ble&s;&s;ing and pronouncing happy tho&s;e whom Men naturally account mo&s;t un|happy. After rectifying their Judgment in the&s;e Re&s;pects, he proceeds directly to oppo&s;e the corrupt Glo&s;&s;es which the Scribes and Phari&s;ees had ca&s;t over the Law: He aims to arou&s;e and alarm his Hearers, by a&s;&s;uring them that unle&s;s their <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> was of a &s;uperior kind to that of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> Men of whom they had &s;uch an high Opinion, they &s;hould <HI>in no wi&s;e enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> Unle&s;s they came to &s;ee more of the Spirituality and Extent of the Laws of God, than the Phari&s;ees either did or taught, they mu&s;t a&s;&s;uredly peri&s;h. Now the Phari&s;ees made the Laws of God extend only to the outward Conduct, and &s;eemed not to imagine that they referred to the inward Di&s;po&s;ition and Thoughts of the Heart.</P>
<P>Our Divine Lord begins,&mdash; he goes through a Number of the moral Precepts: He gives In&s;tances fir&s;t in the Law of <HI>killing;</HI> then in that of Adultery, of Divorces, of Swearing, of Revenge, and &s;o on. Our
<PB N="5" REF="011491_0003_0F8331365D0C2840">
Text is a con&s;equential In&s;truction upon the fir&s;t of the&s;e. The Phari&s;ees u&s;ually introduced their Lectures upon the Law, with this Expre&s;&s;inn; <HI>"It hath been &s;aid of them in old Time."</HI> As if it was more re&s;pectable that the&s;e Laws &s;hould come under the Appearance of a Tradition from Men, than of the immediate Command of God. It is by Way of Remark upon this Arrogance, that our Lord tells his Hearers,&mdash;<Q><HI>Ye have heard, it hath been &s;aid of them in old Time,</HI></Q> THOU SHALT NOT KILL. The Phari&s;ees had made this Addition of their own, "<HI>but who&s;oever &s;hall kill, &s;hall be in Danger of the Judgment.</HI> Now Je&s;us Chri&s;t enters into the &s;piri|tual Latitude of this Command; and teaches them that it extends to our <HI>Words,</HI> and to the <HI>Feeling of the Heart,</HI> as well as to the Action of Murder. He makes the Man in a Degree chargeable with Murder, who lifts his Tongue again&s;t his Brother. Nay, if he is only angry at his Brother without a Cau&s;e, he finds him guilty of the Breach of the &s;ixth Command. <Q><HI>But I &s;ay unto you, that who&s;oever is angry with his Brother without a Cau&s;e;</HI> who&s;oever <HI>calleth him Raca, thou Fool,</HI> or any &s;uch ha&s;ty idle Names, in a Fit of Anger, has broken this Command, and is in Danger not only of temporal Puni&s;hment, but of <HI>Hell Fire.</HI></Q> And it mu&s;t be &s;o; for if Men &s;uffer their Pa&s;&s;ions to ri&s;e to &s;uch a Degree, as that they entertain the lea&s;t De&s;ire of private Revenge, and te&s;tify this their Di&s;po&s;ition, by calling Names, or reviling; they &s;hew, that they have in their Hearts the Seeds of Murder, or tho&s;e Begin|nings from which Murder u&s;ually &s;prings.</P>
<P>Now mark what follows; for it is our Text&punc; <HI>"Therefore, if thou bring thy Gift to the Altar."</HI> It is introduced within <HI>"Therefore,"</HI> becau&s;e it follows from what has ju&s;t been &s;aid. As much as to &s;ay,&mdash;<HI>from
<PB N="6" REF="011491_0004_0F833137174D7FF8">
what you have heard, you may learn, that if you bring your Gift to the Altar, and remember that your Brother hath aught again&s;t you.</HI> Since, therefore, ra&s;h Anger and abu&s;ive Language, hath &s;omewhat murd'rous in it; and while you continue in that Frame, you live in the Breach of the Command we have been con&s;idering; when you come to make an Offering to the Lord, and remem|ber that your Brother hath a Right to accu&s;e you of any Thing of this Kind; <HI>hath aught again&s;t you:</HI> If you re|member that your Neighbour might ju&s;tly lay it to your Charge, that you have within you the Seeds of Murder, or an angry vengeful Spirit; if you are con&s;cious of it, that you entertain &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition, and that in Ju&s;tice he might accu&s;e you of it did he know it; never think that this is a proper Frame of Mind to do any Duty acceptably in: Never &s;uppo&s;e, that while the Spirit of Murder re&s;ts in your Bo&s;om, God will accept your Offering. If <HI>you remember</HI> it, if you call to mind, if you are con&s;cious of that wicked Frame of Soul, think not that any Oblations can be accepted. While you live in Anger with your Neighbour, God will never be plea&s;ed with you: Unle&s;s you pardon, God will never Pardon, Unle&s;s you love, God will never accept.</P>
<P><HI>"If therefore thou bring thy Gift to the Altar."</HI></P>
<P>We beg Leave to remark, that the&s;e <HI>Gifts,</HI> or Free-will-Offerings, were much pre&s;&s;ed upon the People by the Phari&s;ees. The People were taught, that the&s;e were the mo&s;t important and acceptable of all their Services; that without the&s;e, every Thing el&s;e availed nothing; and e&s;pecially they were taught, that the&s;e Gifts would atone for all Sins not puni&s;hable by the Judge.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whitby in loc.</NOTE> It is for this Rea&s;on our Lord makes mention
<PB N="7" REF="011491_0004_0F833137174D7FF8">
of Gifts, rather than of any other Kind of Service. As if he had &s;aid, "No Act of Religion, however important, however co&s;tly, not even tho&s;e Free-will-Offerings or Gifts, which your fal&s;e Teachers tell you, are able to atone for your Crimes, can them&s;elves be accepted of God, while your Brother might ju&s;tly accu&s;e you of having a Spirit of Anger or Revenge in your Brea&s;t." If you are con&s;cious therefore, that this is your Ca&s;e, and have brought your Gift to the very Altar; if you are ever &s;o near approached to a religious Action, pau&s;e&mdash;reflect upon what you are about&mdash; think how vain to approach God with an implacable Heart towards Man.</P>
<P><HI>"Leave there thy Gift before the Altar, and go thy Way."</HI> Here it is proper to ob&s;erve, that this Advice was given to the Jew, and to him it was literally practica|ble. It was cu&s;tomary with them, as &s;ome tell us, when they came to the Altar, and remembered any Thing, which at that Time might prevent them, to <HI>leave there their Gift</HI> until another Time; perhaps the next Day; and then come and formally offer it. In &s;uch Ca&s;e, it was no Detriment to them, nor to the Sacrifice. Whether that particular Gift is offered To-day, or deferred until To-morrow, is a Matter of no Impor|tance, &s;o be it is offered or given. To defer a Day, doth not hinder any other Offering due at the Time. And in this Re&s;pect it differed from the &s;piritual Duties of the Chri&s;tian. With us, if deferred, the Duty in mo&s;t Ca&s;es is not done. A Chri&s;tian Duty, deferred until next Sea&s;on, is in mo&s;t In&s;tances, left undone. My praying To-day, will not an&s;wer for my not praying Ye&s;terday; and &s;o of all other &s;piritual Duties. But of this by-and-by. It was however literally practicable by the Jew. <HI>Leave there thy Gift, and go thy Way.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="011491_0005_0F833137CFA3B150"><HI>"Fir&s;t be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy Gift."</HI></P>
<P>From the Scope of the Text, you &s;ee, that the <HI>Reconciliation</HI> here intended, was to be <HI>within his own Heart.</HI> It is the &s;piritual Breach of the &s;ixth Command that our Redeemer is here oppo&s;ing. Now, if the Man's Heart was thoroughly &s;weetened towards his Neighbour, when he came to make the Offering, then he could not be chargeable with this Crime. Nor can it be imagined, that our Lord de&s;igned to forbid the Jew to make any Offering, &s;o long as one of his fellow Creatures was di&s;plea&s;ed with him. To reconcile the Hearts of others, is not in our Power; and if we mu&s;t defer Duties until this is done, we may defer forever. Our Bu&s;ine&s;s is not &s;o much with others, as with our own Hearts; and the improper Frame of no other Man upon Earth, can be a Rea&s;on why I &s;hould not perform my Duty. It is a great Mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e, that the <HI>Reconciliation</HI> here &s;poken of, intends <HI>the Settlement of all Matters in Debate</HI> between him about to offer, and his Neighbour. It was, it mo&s;t certainly is, a de&s;irable Thing, that the Wor&s;hippers of the &s;ame God, &s;hould unite in Heart with each other: Happy, if, when we approach the God of Peace, in the &s;olemn Duties of Religion, we can view our&s;elves at Peace with all Men, and all Men at Peace with us. Nay, it is the undoubted Duty of all, to give their Neighbour Satisfaction, wherein they are con&s;cious they have injured him. Nor need they expect to meet with Acceptance from God, in any Duty, however important, unle&s;s, at lea&s;t, they are di&s;po&s;ed to give Satisfaction, and repair any wilful Wrong they may have done. But it is plain, that what our Lord here refers to, is the Temper of the Heart; <HI>"Go thy Way, fir&s;t be reconciled to thy Brother.</HI> Let
<PB N="9" REF="011491_0005_0F833137CFA3B150">
your Heart be thoroughly &s;weetened towards him, before you can expect that God will accept your Offer|ing. Come not with a Breach of the &s;ixth Command burning in your Brea&s;t. While in that Frame, the Lord will look upon you as a Murderer, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t co&s;tly Offering you can bring. Be therefore reconciled in Heart to thy Brother, and <HI>then come</HI> and offer thy Gift. Where you ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>The Command is to perform the Duty &s;till. The Jew mu&s;t not omit the Offering, tho' he is permitted to withdraw for a Time, to &s;ubdue his Heart to a &s;oft and charitable Frame; No,&mdash;the religious Act is not to be left undone. It was not left to his Option, whether he would perform it or not. He mu&s;t be reconciled to his Brother, and he mu&s;t come and offer his Gift.</P>
<P>We proceed to &s;hew you the Application of this to our&s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Application of this will affect our Judgment and our Practice.</P>
<P>It &s;erves to rectify our Judgment in &s;everal Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. It &s;hews in the fir&s;t Place, with irre&s;i&s;tible Evi|dence, that he who will not be reconciled in Heart to his Neighbour, need not think of being reconciled to God. Sure if God will not accept the Sacrifice, he will not accept the Per&s;on. Object not here, that <HI>he who believeth &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> We grant that &s;uch an one <HI>is ju&s;tified freely by the Grace of Chri&s;t, and has Peace with God.</HI> But a Go&s;pel Temper of Mind, and an Obedience to the Precepts of the Go&s;pel, is the only Evidence of a true Faith. You may a&s;&s;uredly know that your Faith is not genuine, if it doth not produce a go&s;pel Temper, and an evangelical Conduct. That Man never had true Faith, who will not be recon|ciled
<PB N="10" REF="011491_0006_0F833138B34C9D38">
to his Neighbour. That Man can never be recon|ciled to God, who refu&s;es to be at Peace with his Brother. Nothing can be more po&s;itive than our Saviour's Declaration to this Purpo&s;e. Matth. vi. 15. <HI>But if ye forgive not Men their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither will your Father forgive your Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</HI> You &s;ee, there is no Pardon of Sin for tho&s;e who will not pardon. When our divine Ma&s;ter gave his Di&s;ciples (not a Form, but) a <HI>Directory for Prayer,</HI> he commanded them to pray for Forgivene&s;s, only upon the Condition of their forgiving tho&s;e who had tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t them. Our Forgivene&s;s mu&s;t not be meerly in Part, &s;uch as you exerci&s;e when you only refrain from returning the like Injury, tho' your Heart feels unkind,&mdash;it mu&s;t not be meerly &s;uch a Forgivene&s;s as will permit you to &s;ay Things to the Di&s;advantage of the Per&s;on, or at lea&s;t will &s;uffer you to withold your Hand from a kind Office, to which you would have been di&s;po&s;ed, had he not offended you. While &s;uch is the Di&s;po&s;ition of your Mind, think what it is you a&s;k when you pray, <HI>forgive us our Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, as we forgive tho&s;e who tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us! As we forgive.</HI> O Sirs! were God to forgive you by Halves, as you forgive your Neighbours; were he only to puni&s;h you in &s;ome other Way,&mdash;were he to withold his divine Favour, and not do you kind Offices, (and this is what you pray for) what would become of you? The Forgivene&s;s which the Go&s;pel demands, is entire and complete. Not only are we to pardon, but we are to love. Not only to forgive, but to love &s;in|cerely,&mdash;<HI>to love our Neighbour as our&s;elves.</HI> And without this <HI>Charity,</HI> all other Accompli&s;hments in the World are <HI>nothing;</HI> are no Evidences of true Chri&s;tianity. It is therefore a certain Truth, that he who will not be reconciled to his Neighbour, need not think of being reconciled to God.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="011491_0006_0F833138B34C9D38">2. It informs us al&s;o, that the Duty of Forgivene&s;s and Charity, is much more acceptable to God, than the mo&s;t co&s;tly Sacrifices. Nay, he will not accept of the greate&s;t Gift we can pre&s;ent him, where the&s;e are want|ing. The Jew was ordered to lay a&s;ide his Free-will-Offering, until he had brought his Mind to &s;ubmit to Forgivene&s;s and Love, to &s;ignify to him and us, that were we to give all we have to God, he would not accept where Reconciliation and Love was wanting. Let us never think, therefore, that God will take any Notice of our Re&s;entments, unle&s;s our Hearts are right towards our Neighbour. <HI>Could I &s;peak with</HI> Ten Thou&s;and <HI>Tongues,</HI> and could I conver&s;e like an Angel; could I a&s;toni&s;h the World with Miracles,&mdash;were I &s;o generous as to <HI>give all I po&s;&s;e&s;s in Alms; nay,</HI> &s;o attached to the Religion I profe&s;s, as to <HI>give my Body to be burned</HI> in its Vindication; yet, <HI>if I have not Charity, I am nothing.</HI></P>
<P>But, to apply this Direction to our own Practice. Tho' we are not literally in the Circum&s;tance of the Jew, and are not therefore literally to practice this Command; yet are we to act up to the Spirit of the Precept, as far as practicable in our Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">1. When we approach God in any Duty, and reflect that our Neighbour might ju&s;tly accu&s;e us of a mali|cious unchri&s;tian Spirit towards him, we ought imme|diately to pau&s;e,&mdash;accu&s;e our&s;elves of it, <HI>judge our&s;elves that we be not judged;</HI> be humble under a Sen&s;e of our Sin, and immediately bring our Hearts to con&s;ent to a perfect Reconciliation with him. The Moment we recollect the Evil, we &s;hould put it from us; forgive without Delay, and love without Re&s;erve; nor dare to approach God with a Spirit of Murder in our Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e is &s;uppo&s;able in which a Duty may be inno|cently omitted, a &s;ufficient Time to give us the Oppor|tunity
<PB N="12" REF="011491_0007_0F83313963037C58">
of lei&s;urely reflecting, and exerci&s;ing our Minds upon the Evil of an unforgiving Temper; and of bringing it to a complete Submi&s;&s;ion to the Commands of the Go&s;pel. But in mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Duties, e&s;pecially in the common Ordinances of our Religion, a literal Omi&s;&s;ion of them for a Time, cannot be done without Guilt. Now, in each of the&s;e, we bring our&s;elves and all we have, and are a <HI>Gift to the Altar.</HI> Prayer is nothing le&s;s than a &s;olemn practical Acknowledgment, that all we have and are, came from God, and is depen|dant on him,&mdash;and an Offering made of the &s;ame to his Service. Here then is a <HI>Gift brought to the Spiritual Altar.</HI> Here is a Duty which cannot be omitted. We are to pray always; <HI>"pray without cea&s;ing."</HI> But &s;hall we dare bring <HI>this Gift:</HI>&mdash;&s;hall we dare approach God to a&s;k his Pardon, while we refu&s;e to pardon? Shall we dare to come near the <HI>Tryer of the Reins,</HI> with an Heart filled with Rancour again&s;t Man? And yet, we mu&s;t approach him,&mdash;and yet the Duty mu&s;t not be omitted. Here then you &s;ee the Heart mu&s;t be brought to bow without Delay. No &s;ooner, therefore, does the Evil ari&s;e, than it ought to be cru&s;hed. Extingui&s;h the Spark e'er it becomes a Flame.</P>
<P>If therefore, you will act up to the Spirit of this Precept, you will oppo&s;e the fir&s;t Ri&s;ings of a vengeful Spirit, and bring your Hearts directly to Benevolence and Love; and remember, that you are utterly di&s;qua|lified for Attendance upon any one Chri&s;tian Duty, until this is done.</P>
<P>"You can't"&mdash;&s;ay you? <Q>You have endeavoured, but find it impo&s;&s;ible to be perfectly reconciled, after &s;uch egregious Abu&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>And is this brought as an Excu&s;e for your continuing in a malignant Frame of Mind? The Exce&s;s of your
<PB N="13" REF="011491_0007_0F83313963037C58">
Iniquity brought as an Apology for it? To &s;ay, <HI>we cannot,</HI> in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, is an Abu&s;e of Language. Thy ob&s;ti-Heart is aver&s;e to the Thing; it <HI>will not yield.</HI> Speak the Truth, and you will &s;ay, that after &s;uch ill Treat|ment, you <HI>will not,</HI> your Heart will not con&s;ent to the mortifying Propo&s;al of Chri&s;t. The eternal God com|mands, and you will not obey. The Lord Je&s;us in&s;i&s;ts upon it, as a Trial of your Allegiance to him, and you will not &s;ubmit. There is no Excu&s;e. The Greatne&s;s of the Injury received, is no Rea&s;on why we &s;hould di&s;obey God, and con&s;ent to be abandoned by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But, know ye, that unle&s;s you &s;ubmit to this Propo&s;al, you &s;hall never be accepted in one Duty; nay, you &s;hall never meet with Mercy.&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">III. The Abu&s;e to which this Text is liable, is a third Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Many Profe&s;&s;ors of the Religion of Chri&s;t, think them&s;elves warranted by this Text, in ab&s;enting from Ordinances, when they have met with an Affront or ill U&s;age from any of their Brethren.</HI> This is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t common Abu&s;e. An Abu&s;e by which the Text is turned up&s;ide down. They do not enquire, whether their Neighbour has <HI>aught again&s;t them,</HI> but whether they have <HI>aught again&s;t their Neighbour.</HI> Upon the &s;lighte&s;t Review of what has been &s;aid, you mu&s;t &s;ee, that the&s;e Words give no Warrant for their Ab&s;ence. The Que&s;tion is not, whether you have been ill-u&s;ed by a Brother, or not? The Que&s;tion is, <HI>how do you feel upon it?</HI> Whether you retain in your Heart an unfor|giving unkind Temper towards him? Not whether he has injured you? But whether on that Account you injure your God and your Redeemer? Whether if he could &s;ee your Heart, he might not accu&s;e you of a Breach of
<PB N="14" REF="011491_0008_0F83313A6F8CBEA8">
the &s;ixth Command? Not whether <HI>you have aught again&s;t</HI> him? but whether <HI>he has aught again&s;t you?</HI> If a Man has abu&s;ed you, this cannot unfit you to attend on God. Let him be who he will, &s;uppo&s;e it even the Man by who&s;e Hands the Ordinance is di&s;pen&s;ed; if he has injuriou&s;ly treated you, this cannot prevent your finding Acceptance with God, in the Di&s;charge of your Duty, unle&s;s your abominable Temper prevents you. And if Men do us wrong, mu&s;t we therefore wrong our God? Why then di&s;plea&s;e him by neglecting his Com|mand, when a <HI>Worm of Du&s;t</HI> has di&s;plea&s;ed us?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To refu&s;e to join in the Ordinances of Religion, until &s;uch an Offender, whether real or imaginary, has given Satisfaction, and a Reconciliation thereby brought about,</HI> is another, or rather an Improvement upon the former Abu&s;e. Horrid Abu&s;e indeed! by which this Precept which was directly levelled again&s;t our own Corruptions, and in&s;i&s;ts upon our mortifying them immediately, is perverted to procure their Gratification. You will not bring your Gift to the Altar of God, until his Creature has humbled him&s;elf, and thereby reconciled him&s;elf to you? Unrea&s;onable Man! Thou do&s;t not a&s;k, whether thy Heart has the Seeds of Murder in it, and whether thou ha&s;t not need of Humiliation? but whether thy Neighbour is in the Wrong. But pray;&mdash;when we draw near to God, is it our Neighbour or our&s;elves that we are to <HI>examine?</HI> In Attendance upon Ordinances, what Bu&s;ine&s;s have we with the Qualifications of our Neighbours? Is not our Bu&s;ine&s;s with our&s;elves? The Reconciliation which we &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon, is it not in our own Brea&s;t? In Attendance upon God, what Bu&s;i|ne&s;s have you to in&s;i&s;t on Satisfaction from others? What tho' a Brother never gives you Satisfaction; mu&s;t you therefore deny your&s;elf the grand Privileges of a

Chri&s;tian? If he never gives you Satisfaction, mu&s;t you therefore be the le&s;s reconciled in Heart? If he never gives you Satisfaction, mu&s;t you therefore deny God the publick Honours which you are bound to pay him? Is it to God or to Man that we attend on Ordinances? What mean you, Chri&s;tians, by this &s;trange Perver&s;ion of the Coun&s;el of the Son of God? No more plead Con&s;ci|ence on this Head; it is an In&s;ult on that faithful Monitor within us, to make him give his Suffrage to Iniquity.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>To refu&s;e to join the publick Ordinances of Chri&s;ti|anity, becau&s;e there may be one or more there whom you di&s;like, or of whom you have a bad Opinion,</HI> is another Abu&s;e; which, tho' it has no Colour of Plea from our Text, yet has its Place among Profe&s;&s;ors. If it &s;hould be that your angry Re&s;entments again&s;t the Per&s;on of a Brother is at the Bottom; and your <HI>De&s;ire to te&s;tify your Di&s;like,</HI> the whole Cau&s;e of your Refu&s;al to join with him; without need of a &s;ingle Argument to prove it &s;o, we pronounce it a ba&s;e and criminal Cau&s;e. Your own Con&s;cience confirms it. Nothing can be more unchri|&s;tian, nothing more oppo&s;ed to our Text. It is this Temper which it demands to be &s;ubdued. Now, if in&s;tead of this, you will make your private Picque a Rea&s;on why you &s;hould di&s;obey God, and refu&s;e to own him before Men; if in&s;tead of this, you will deba&s;e a publick Ordinance, by making it the Means of te&s;tify|ing to the World an ungodly Temper: How criminal do you render your&s;elf? Is this a Way to &s;hew private Re&s;entment? Shall Men dare to make a &s;olemn Tran&s;|action with God the Means of &s;upporting a Quarrel with Men? But,</P>
<P>Should it be that your Judgment is really wrong in this Matter? Do you really think, that we are held not
<PB N="16" REF="011491_0009_0F83313AE1593370">
to communicate with one whom we e&s;teem vicious? Is it Sentiment and not Temper? Sure our Text does not in the lea&s;t Degree tend to &s;upport this Notion, as it has nothing to do with our Neighbours Characters, but with our own. The Sentiment is ab&s;urdly wrong. For in the fir&s;t Place; my good or bad Opinion of my Neighbour, is not to regulate my Conduct in immediate Duty towards God. Becau&s;e I think the Man <HI>who &s;its down with me,</HI> a Villain, and that he ought to be deprived of the Privilege, is it rea&s;onable that on that Account I &s;hould deprive my&s;elf of the Privilege? Becau&s;e he &s;ins, &s;hall not I therefore do a commanded Duty? Shall we omit po&s;itive Duties, becau&s;e there will always be Sinners in the Church? Upon this Plan all the &s;ocial Duties of Religion mu&s;t cea&s;e. Sure I may confe&s;s my Saviour in Company with an Hypocrite, and yet not be an Hypocrite. I may &s;it down with an impious Man, and yet not patronize his Iniquity.</P>
<P>But,</P>
<P><Q>A Church, &s;ay you, ought to bear Te&s;timony again&s;t &s;candalous Per&s;ons.</Q> We grant it: But am I a Church? Am I to be both Judge and Jury in this Ca&s;e? Sure a Church ought to be its own Judge, when a Per&s;on is &s;candalous: I am not to be its Judge, and to determine when it &s;hall proceed to Cen&s;ure. An Individual &s;hews great Arrogance indeed, when he pre&s;umes to act as Judge and Executioner in any Ca&s;e of that Kind; and, if the Church does not coincide with him, to cen&s;ure both the Church and the accu&s;ed too. A Church cannot cen&s;ure until the Crime is made manife&s;t to their Con&s;ciences; they <HI>cannot condemn a Man until he is proved Guilty.</HI> Now tho' I know him to be &s;o, but cannot make it appear to the Church, it is not my Province in this Ca&s;e to take the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a

Church upon me. I have no Right to bear my public Te&s;timony again&s;t him, by excommunicating him, or rather my&s;elf on his Account. If God has made me the Judge, and given me the Right to puni&s;h by my&s;elf, any Crimes that I know to be committed, then let me act in this Office, and ab&s;ent my&s;elf in Te&s;timony thereof. But I have no more Right to execute upon my own private Opinion, in eccle&s;ia&s;tical than in civil Cau&s;es. You know that a Man has committed Murder; &mdash;but you cannot make it appear &s;o to the Court: Will you in this Ca&s;e pre&s;ume to put the Murderer to Death? No,&mdash;you your&s;elf would become a Murderer in the Eye of the Law. What is he then who will per&s;i&s;t in pa&s;&s;ing public Cen&s;ure upon a Brother, by ab&s;enting him&s;elf from Ordinances, in which his Brother joins; even tho' he knows him guilty; when he either <HI>has not,</HI> or <HI>cannot</HI> make him appear &s;o the Church? What are you to &s;ay, M. H. who pre&s;ume to take the Keys of Di&s;cipline into your own Hands? How is it, that one Man will thus take the Place of a whole Church, and that too under Pretence of Duty? And how audacious e&s;peciallly, and how contrary to the Laws of Chri&s;t, and to all Rules of good Society, does that Man act who ab&s;ents him&s;elf with a View to Cen&s;ure the Church of which he is only a Member; or dare to threaten the Body of Chri&s;t, with leaving it, unle&s;s it conforms it&s;elf to his Judgment? And how often do Men attempt to make Church Di&s;cipline the Means of avenging private Quarrels? How often does meer Temper influ|ence in this Matter! O Sirs! it is tremendous trifling with the Things of God. Let us get our Views of the&s;e Things &s;ettled, and act as before him, who con|ver&s;es with our Con&s;ciences.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="011491_0010_0F83313B929FA3A0">Whatever may be our Judgment of a Man, it does not di&s;pen&s;e with our Duty to God. Tho' a Judas was &s;itting down with us, before he was proved a Judas, it need not alter our Conduct. Je&s;us Chri&s;t was pre&s;ent with his Di&s;ciples; he gave them the fir&s;t Sacrament by way of Pattern for all Ages, and ble&s;&s;ed them, tho' he knew that <HI>one of then was a Devil.</HI> But he was not proved &s;o at that Time to his little Church. So he may be pre&s;ent with us and ble&s;s us, tho' there be more than one Traitor among us. And if the little Church, of which Je&s;us him&s;elf was the Mini&s;ter in Per&s;on, was not free from &s;uch; how vain, how infinitely ab&s;urd for any Sect of Men to pretend to, or hope for a pure Church here!</P>
<P N="4">4. It is another Abu&s;e of this Text, <HI>when a Church omits the Lord's Supper on Account of &s;ome Quarrel or Di&s;affection among them.</HI> To give Way to the Omi&s;&s;ion of public Duties, becau&s;e of the &s;inful Temper of Individuals is to give Way to the Devil, who foments Confu&s;ion; not to comply with the Command, which is to cau&s;e &s;uch a Temper to &s;ub&s;ide immediately, and then to proceed in the Duty. The Jew was to offer his Gift notwith&s;tanding; and is a Chri&s;tian, is a whole Church permitted to omit the Ordinances of Religion, and that from Time to Time? If ever there was an Ordinance calculated to promote Peace and Love, it is the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; and methinks it is a wretched Attempt to procure the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, in the Neglect of God's In&s;titutions, and of &s;uch in particular as are de&s;igned to promote Brotherly Love. Strange that whole Churches &s;hould run into &s;o gro&s;s a Perver|&s;ion of the Will of God!</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="19" REF="011491_0010_0F83313B929FA3A0">5. It is, in the la&s;t Place, a grievous Abu&s;e of this Text, <HI>to apply it to the Lord's Supper, more than to any other Ordinance or &s;olemn religious Duty of Chri&s;tianity.</HI> That it was ever applied particularly to this In&s;titution, more than to others, is &s;trange. It is plain, that our Lord mentions the Duty of Gifts or Free-will-Offerings, becau&s;e they were con&s;idered among the Jews as the mo&s;t important and meritorious of all their Services: That hence they might naturally conclude, if in the mo&s;t important they could not meet with Acceptance; &s;ure not in the le&s;s important. But what nearer Affinity the&s;e Gifts had to the Lord's Supper, than any other In&s;titution of Chri&s;t, it is hard to tell; and how &s;o many of us per&s;i&s;t in applying the Injunction to this Sacrament more than any other Ordinance, is &s;urpri&s;ing. And yet the Man, who with this Mi&s;application with|draws him&s;elf from the Lord's Supper, does not on this Account withdraw from the Bapti&s;m of his Child, where one would think the <HI>Offer of a Gift</HI> is &s;till more formal,&mdash;he does not ab&s;ent from Prayer, &amp;c. Per|haps the prejudice may have originally aro&s;e from a Romi&s;h Super&s;tition, &mdash;(the infinitely ab&s;urd Remains of which we &s;till &s;ee upheld in a <HI>Prote&s;tant Church,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To have an Altar, when you declare, that there is no Sacrifice to be made upon it; to have a Prie&s;t under the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;a|tion, when you confe&s;s that Chri&s;t <HI>has once offered him&s;elf up for us all,</HI> and <HI>made an End of Sin;</HI> to fall down in a Po&s;ture of Adoration, when you confe&s;s that it is only Bread and Wine, and not the adorable Saviour, is infinitely more ab&s;urd, than the&s;e Things among the Roman Catholicks, who&s;e Belief corre&s;ponds with their Practice.</NOTE>) I mean that of having an Altar in the End of the Church, which looks towards Jeru&s;alem, and the Order of Prie&s;thood &mdash;[a Name which &s;hould not be known in the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try;]
<PB N="20" REF="011491_0011_0F83313C684E9A80">
to offer up Sacrifices of the Body and Blood of our Saviour, into which they &s;uppo&s;e the con&s;ecrated Bread and Wine is really converted: At the Time of which Sacrifice, it is cu&s;tomary with them to bring &s;ome Gift and lay it upon the Altar, for the U&s;e of the Church. Hence, I &s;ay, might po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e that Pre|judice, by which this Text is con&s;idered as more Appli|cable to the Lord's Supper, than to other Chri&s;tian Duties. But as the &s;ame Rea&s;ons hold good; &s;o in all our Approaches to God in every Duty, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved as a Rule, that it cannot be acceptable to him, if our Heart is not di&s;po&s;ed to love our Neighbour. They therefore, who omit this holy Sacrament from &s;uch a Plea, ought, if they are con&s;i&s;tent, for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons, to omit all Chri&s;tian Duties whatever.</P>
<P>We have now gone thro' the Abu&s;es; it remains for you to avoid them. Let us be exhorted, to <HI>lay a&s;ide all Malice and Guile, and Evil-&s;peaking, and as new-born Babes, receive the &s;incere Milk of the Word.</HI> We would not have God deny us Pardon; let us love our Neigh|bour. Let not Temper influence us in Matters of Religion. See! what Havock it makes all around us! And as we are about to give up our Bodies and Souls and all, a Sacrifice to God, in the Ordinance approach|ing; let us &s;trive to have our Hearts &s;weetened towards all Men. O that <HI>the Love of God</HI> might <HI>con&s;train us,</HI> and the Love of Man warm our Bo&s;oms. And as we all hope in the &s;ame Lord Je&s;us, and wi&s;h to go to the &s;ame Heaven, &s;o let us be of one Heart, and live like Brethren. AMEN!</P>
