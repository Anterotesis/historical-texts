<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SUCH</HI> is the Malignity of Man's Nature in his <HI>fallen State,</HI> and &s;o aver&s;e is he from walk|ing in the <HI>&s;traight</HI> and <HI>even Path</HI> of <HI>TRUTH,</HI> that at every Turn he is inclinable to lean either to the Right-hand or to the Left; yea, &s;uch as by the Work of God's Grace in their Hearts, and powerful Operation of his Spirit, have obtained an Entrance in this Way, are daily mole&s;ted, and &s;et upon on all Hands; &s;ome &s;triving to draw them the one Way, &s;ome &s;he other: And if through the Power of God they be kept <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>&s;table,</HI> then are they ca|luminated on both Sides; each likening or compar|ing them to the Wor&s;t of their Enemies.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that are acquainted with the <HI>Holy Scrip|tures,</HI> may ob&s;erve this to be the Lot of the Saints in all Ages; but e&s;pecially tho&s;e, who&s;e Place it hath been to <HI>reform</HI> and <HI>re&s;tore</HI> the Ruins of the Hou&s;e of God, when decayed, or any con&s;iderable Time have been liable to &s;uch Cen&s;ures: Hence tho&s;e that &s;et about repairing of the Walls of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> were nece&s;&s;itated to work with the one Hand, and defend with the other.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="007840_0003_102DB56423330068">
Chri&s;t is accu&s;ed of the <HI>Jews</HI> as a <HI>Samaritan;</HI> and by the <HI>Samaritans</HI> quarrelled for being a <HI>Jew.</HI> The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> is whipped and impri&s;oned by the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and upbraided with being a <HI>Jew,</HI> and teaching their Cu&s;toms; the &s;ame <HI>Paul</HI> is hawled, and ready to be killed by the <HI>Jews,</HI> for breaking the Law, and defiling the Temple with the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> The like hath al&s;o befallen the&s;e <HI>faithful Witne&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Me&s;&s;engers,</HI> whom God has rai&s;ed up in this Day to witne&s;s for his Truth, which hath long been in a great Mea&s;ure hid; but now is again revealed, and many brought to be Witne&s;&s;es of it, who thereby are come to <HI>walk in the Light of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>This People thus gathered, have not wanted tho&s;e Trials, that u&s;ually accompany the Church of Chri&s;t, both on the Right-hand, and on the Left, each cha|racterizing them in &s;uch Terms, as they have judged would prove mo&s;t to their Di&s;advantage. From whence (as the Te&s;timony of the fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t our Lord did not agree neither do the&s;e again&s;t us) &s;ome will have us to be <HI>fooli&s;h, mad Creatures;</HI> others to be <HI>deep, &s;ubtil Politicians;</HI> &s;ome to be <HI>illiterate, ignorant Fellows;</HI> others to be <HI>learned, cunning Je&s;uits,</HI> under a meer Vizard: Divers Profe&s;&s;ors will have us to be only <HI>Pen&s;ioners of the Pope,</HI> undoubtedly <HI>Papi&s;ts;</HI> but the Papi&s;ts abhor us as <HI>He|reticks:</HI> Sometimes we are a <HI>di&s;|orderly, confu&s;ed Rabble,</HI> leav|ing every one to do as they li&s;t, again&s;t all good <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Go|vernment;</HI> at other Times we <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">John Owen <HI>charges us with &s;o much Igno|rance, that tho' he writes again&s;t us in</HI> Latin, <HI>he fears we will not under&s;tand it.

are &s;o much for Order, as we admit not Men to ex|erci&s;e the Liberty of their own Judgments. Thus are our Reputations to&s;&s;ed by the Envy of our Ad|ver&s;aries; which yet cannot but have this Effect upon &s;ober-minded People, as to &s;ee what MALICE works again&s;t us; and how the&s;e Men, by their contradictory A&s;&s;ertions concerning us, &s;ave us the Pains, while they <HI>refute one another.</HI></P>
<P>True it is, we have laboured to walk amid&s;t the&s;e Extremities; and upon our appearing for the Truth, we have found Things <HI>good</HI> in them&s;elves <HI>abu&s;ed</HI> on both Hands: For &s;uch hath always been the Work of an <HI>Apo&s;tacy,</HI> to keep up the <HI>Shadow</HI> of certain <HI>Truths;</HI> that there-through they might &s;hel|ter other <HI>Evils.</HI> Thus the <HI>Jews</HI> made u&s;e of the Law and the Prophets to vindicate their <HI>Abu&s;es;</HI> yea, and to crucify <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> And how much many <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> abu&s;e the <HI>Scriptures</HI> and the <HI>Traditions</HI> of the Apo&s;tles, to uphold Things quite contrary to them, will in the General be readily acknowledged by mo&s;t.</P>
<P>But to de&s;cend more particularly; There be <HI>two Things</HI> e&s;pecially, both of which in their primitive U&s;e were appointed; and did very much contribute towards the Edification of the Church: The one is,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>The Power and Authority, which the Apo&s;tles had given them of Chri&s;t, for the gathering, building up, and govern|ing of his Church; by Virtue of which Power and Authority they al&s;o wrote the Holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The other is, <HI>That Privilege given to every Chri&s;tian under the Go&s;pel, to be led and guided by the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and to be taught thereof in all Things.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="007840_0005_102DB567674A3E28">
Now, both the&s;e in the Primitive-Church wrought effectually towards the &s;ame End of <HI>Edification;</HI> and did (as in their Nature they may, and in their, U&s;e they ought to do) in a good Harmony very well con&s;i&s;t together: But by the Workings of Satan, and Perver&s;ene&s;s of Men, they are made to fight again&s;t and de&s;troy one another. For on the one Hand the <HI>Authority</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> that re&s;ided in the Apo&s;tles, while it is annexed and entailed to an outward Or|dination and Succe&s;&s;ion of Teachers, is made U&s;e of to cloak and cover all Manner of Abu&s;es, even the Height of <HI>Idolatry</HI> and <HI>Super&s;tition.</HI> For by Vir|tue of this Succe&s;&s;ion the&s;e Men claiming the like <HI>Infallibility,</HI> that was in the Apo&s;tles (though they be Strangers to any inward Work or Manife&s;tation of the Spirit in their Hearts) will needs oblige all others to acquie&s;ce and agree to their <HI>Conclu&s;ions,</HI> however different from, or contrary to, the Truths of the Go&s;pel; and yet for any to call &s;uch Conclu|&s;ions in Que&s;tion, or examine them, is no le&s;s than a <HI>heinous Here&s;y,</HI> de&s;erving <HI>Death,</HI> &amp;c. Or while the Revelation of God's Mind is wholly bound up to the&s;e Things already delivered in the Scrip|tures (as if God had &s;poke his <HI>la&s;t Words</HI> there to his People) we are put with our own <HI>natural Under&s;tandings</HI> to debate about the Meanings of them, and forced to interpret them, not as they plainly &s;peak, but ac|cording to the Analogy of a cer|tain Faith made by Men, not &s;o much contrived to an&s;wer the Scriptures, as the Scriptures are &s;trained to vindicate it; which to doubt of, is al&s;o counted <HI>Here&s;y,</HI> de&s;erving no le&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>So faith</HI> James Durham, <HI>a noted Man among the</HI> Pre&s;byterians, <HI>in his Expo&s;ition up|on the</HI> Revela|tions.</NOTE>

than Election out of our native Country, and to be robbed of the common Aid our Nativity entitles us to. And on this Hand, we may boldly &s;ay, both <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> have greatly gone a&s;ide.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, &s;ome are &s;o great Pretenders to <HI>inward Motions</HI> and <HI>Revelations of the Spirit,</HI> that there are no Extravagancies &s;o wild, which they will not cloak with them; and &s;o much are they for every One's following their own Mind, as can admit of no <HI>Chri&s;tian Fellow&s;hip</HI> and <HI>Community,</HI> nor of that good <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> which the Church of Chri&s;t never was, nor can be without. This gives an open Door to all <HI>Libertini&s;m,</HI> and brings great Reproach to the Chri&s;tian Faith. And on this Hand have foully fallen the <HI>German Ana|bapti&s;ts,</HI> &s;o called, <HI>John of Leyden, Knipperdolling,</HI> &amp;c. (in Ca&s;e the&s;e mon&s;trous Things committed by them be &s;uch as they are related) and &s;ome more moderate of that Kind have been found among the People in <HI>England,</HI> called <HI>Ranters:</HI> As it is true, the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> have been branded with both of the&s;e Extreams; it is as true, it hath been and is their Work to avoid them; and to be found in that even and good Path of the <HI>Primitive Church,</HI> where all were (no doubt) led and acted by the Holy Spirit; and might all have <HI>prophe&s;ied one by one;</HI> and yet there was a <HI>Subjection of the Prophets to the Spirits of the Prophets.</HI> There was an <HI>Authority</HI> &s;ome had in the Church, and yet it was for <HI>Edification,</HI> and not for <HI>De&s;truction:</HI> There was an <HI>Obedience in the Lord</HI> to &s;uch as were &s;et over; and a being taught by &s;uch, and et a knowing of the <HI>inward Anointing,</HI> by which ach Individual was to be led into all Truth.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The End of the Law and Beginning of the Go&s;pel-Di&s;pen&s;ation recited.</NOTE> AFTER that the Lord God in his own appointed Time had &s;een meet to put an End to the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Law, which was delivered to the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> by the Mini|&s;try of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> through and by whom he did communicate unto them in the Wilderne&s;s from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> divers Commandments, Ordinances, Appointments and Ob&s;ervations, according as they are te&s;tified in the Writings of the Law; it plea&s;ed him to &s;end his own Son the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the Fulne&s;s of Time; who ha|ving perfectly fulfilled the Law, and the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s thereof, gave Witne&s;s to the Di&s;pen|&s;ation of the Go&s;pel. And having approved him&s;elf, and the Excellency of his Doctrine, by

many great and wonderful Signs and Miracles, he &s;ealed it with his Blood; and triumphing over Death (of which it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to be held) he cheri&s;hed and encouraged his de&s;pi&s;ed Witne&s;&s;es, who had believed in him, in that he appeared to them, after he was rai&s;ed from the Dead; comforting them with the Hope and A&s;&s;urance of the <HI>pouring forth of his Spirit,</HI> by which they were to be led and ordered in all Things; in and by which, he was to be with them to the End of the World, not &s;uffering the Gates of Hell to prevail again&s;t them. By which Spirit come upon them, they being filled, were emboldned to preach the Go&s;pel without Fear; and, in a &s;hort Time, Thou&s;ands were ad|ded to the Church; and the Multitude of them that believed, were of one Heart, and of one Soul, and great Love and Zeal prevailed, and there was nothing lacking for a Sea&s;on.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The divers Sorts of them that were cal|led in the Apo&s;tles Days.</NOTE> But all that were caught in the Net, did not prove good and whole&s;ome Fi&s;h; &s;ome were again to be ca&s;t into that Ocean, from whence they were drawn: Of tho&s;e many that were called, all proved not cho&s;en Ve&s;|&s;els, fit for the Ma&s;ter's U&s;e; and of all that were brought into the great Supper and Marriage of the King's Son, there were that were found without the Wedding-Garment.&mdash;Some made a &s;hew for a Sea&s;on, and afterwards fell away; there were that drew back; there were that made Shipwreck of Faith, and of a good Con&s;cience: There were not only &s;uch as did back&s;lide them&s;elves, but &s;ought to draw

others into the &s;ame Perdition with them&s;elves, &s;eeking to overturn their Faith al&s;o; yea, there were that brought in damnable Here&s;ies, even denying the Lord that bought them. And al&s;o of tho&s;e Members that became not wholly cor|rupt (for &s;ome were never again re&s;tored by Re|pentance) there were that were weak, and &s;ickly, and young; &s;ome were to be fed with Milk, and not with &s;trong Meat; &s;ome were to be purged, when the old Leaven received any Place; and &s;ome to be cut off for a Sea&s;on, to be &s;hut out (as it were) of the Camp for a Time, until their Lepro&s;y was healed, and then to be received in again.</P>
<P>Moreover, as to <HI>Outwards,</HI> there was the Care of the Poor, of the Widow, of the Fatherle&s;s, of the Strangers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Therefore the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Order in the Church of God in the Outward.</NOTE> who is the Head of the Body, the Church (for the Church is the Body of Chri&s;t, and the Saints are the &s;everal Mem|bers of that Body) knowing in his infinite Wi&s;|dom, what was needful for the good ordering and di&s;po&s;ing all Things in their proper Place, and for pre&s;erving and keeping all Things in their right Station, did, in the Di&s;pen&s;ation and Com|munication of his Holy Spirit, mini&s;ter unto every Member, a <HI>Mea&s;ure of the &s;ame Spirit,</HI> yet diver&s;e according to Operation, for the Edification of the Body; &s;ome Apo&s;tles, &s;ome Teachers, &s;ome Pa&s;tors, &s;ome Elders: There are old Men, there are young Men, there are Babes. For all are not Apo&s;tles, neither are all Elders, neither are all Babes; yet are all Members: And as &s;uch,

all have a Sen&s;e and Feeling of the Life of the Body, which, from the Head, flows unto all the Body, <HI>as the Ointment of</HI> Aaron<HI>'s Beard, unto the Skirts of his Garment:</HI> And every Member has its Place and Station in the Body, &s;o long as it keeps in the Life of the Body; and all have need one of another; yet is no Member to a&s;&s;ume another Place in the Body, than God has given it; nor yet to grudge or repine its follow Mem|ber's Place; but to be content with its own: For the uncomely Parts are no le&s;s needful than the comely; and the le&s;s honourable than the more honourable; which the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> holds forth in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. from Ver&s;e 13 to 30.</P>

<P>Now though &s;uch, and the Spirit by which they are acted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Subtilty of that Spi|rit.</NOTE> be &s;ufficient|ly &s;een and felt by Thou&s;ands, who&s;e Hearts God has &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed, as they are out of Danger of being intangled in that Snare, and who have Power and Strength in them&s;elves to judge that Spirit, even in its mo&s;t &s;ubtil Appearances; yet there are, who can|not &s;o well with&s;tand the Subtilty, and &s;eeming Sincerity &s;ome &s;uch pretend to, though in Mea|&s;ure they have a Sight of them; and others, that cannot &s;o rightly di&s;tingui&s;h between the Preci|ous and the Vile; and &s;ome there are that through Weakne&s;s, and want of true Di&s;cerning, may be deceived, and the Simplicity in them betrayed for a Sea&s;on; as it is written, <HI>With fair Speeches and &s;mooth Words, they deceive the Hearts of the Simple.</HI></P>
