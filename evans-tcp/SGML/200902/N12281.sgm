<P>THOSE who expect to reap the ble&s;&s;ings of Freedom, mu&s;t, like men, undergo the fatigue of &s;upporting it. The event of ye&s;terday is one of tho&s;e kind of alarms, which is ju&s;t &s;ufficient to rou&s;e us to duty, without being of con&s;e|quence enough to depre&s;s our fortitude. It is not a field of a few acres of ground, but a cau&s;e that we are defending, and whether we defeat the enemy in one battle, or by degrees, the con&s;equence will be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Look back at the events of la&s;t winter and the pre&s;ent year, there you will find that the enemy's &s;ucce&s;&s;es have always contributed to reduce them. What they have gained in ground, they paid &s;o dearly for in numbers, that their victories have in the end amounted to defeats. We have always been ma&s;ters at the la&s;t pu&s;h, and always &s;hall while we do our duty. Howe has been once on the banks of the Delaware, and from thence driven back with lo&s;s and di&s;grace; and why not be again driven from the Schuylkill? His condition and ours are very different. He has every body to fight, we have only his <HI>one</HI> army to cope with and which wa&s;tes away at every en|gagement; we can not only reinforce, but can redouble our numbers; he is cut off from all &s;upplies, and mu&s;t &s;ooner or later inevitably fall into our hands.</P>
<P>Shall a band of ten or twelve thou&s;and robbers, who are this day fifteen hundred or two thou&s;and men le&s;s in &s;trength than they were ye&s;terday, conquer America, or &s;ubdue even a &s;ingle &s;tate? The thing cannot be, unle&s;s we &s;it down and &s;uffer them to do it. Another &s;uch a bru&s;h, notwith|&s;tanding we lo&s;t the ground, would, by &s;till reducing the enemy, put them in a condition to be afterwards totally defeated.</P>
<P>Could our whole army have come up to the attack at one time, the con&s;equences had probably been otherwi&s;e; but our having different parts of the Brandywine creek to guard, and the uncertainty which road to Philadelphia the enemy would attempt to take, naturally afforded them an opportu|nity of pa&s;&s;ing with their main body at a place where only a part of ours could be po&s;ted; for, it mu&s;t &s;trike every thinking man with conviction, that it requires a much greater force to oppo&s;e an enemy in &s;everal places, than is &s;ufficient to defeat them in any one place.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="015495_0003_0F998683857D9038">Men who are &s;incere in defending their freedom, will al|ways feel concern at every circum&s;tance, which &s;eems to make again&s;t them; it is the natural and hone&s;t con&s;equence of all affectionate attachments, and the want of it is a vice. But the dejection la&s;ts only for a moment; they &s;oon ri&s;e out of it with additional vigor; the glow of hope, courage and forti|tude, will, in a little time, &s;upply the place of every inferior pa&s;&s;ion, and kindle the whole heart into heroi&s;m.</P>
<P>There is a my&s;tery in the countenance of &s;ome cau&s;es, which we have not always pre&s;ent judgment enough to ex|plain. It is di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to &s;ee an enemy advancing into a coun|try, but it is the only place in which we can beat them, and in which we have always beaten them, whenever they made the attempt. The nearer any di&s;ea&s;e approaches to a cri&s;is, the nearer it is to a cure: Danger and deliverance make their advances together, and it is only at the la&s;t pu&s;h, that one or the other takes the lead.</P>
<P>There are many men who will do their duty when it is not wanted; but a genuine Public &s;pirit always appears mo&s;t when there is mo&s;t occa&s;ion for it. Thank GOD! our army, though fatigued, is yet entire. The attack made by us ye&s;terday was under many di&s;advantages, naturally ari&s;ing from the uncertainty of knowing which route the enemy would take; and from that circum&s;tance, the whole of our force could not be brought up together time enough to engage all at once. Our &s;trength is yet re&s;erved; and it is evident that Howe does not think him&s;elf a gainer by the af|fair, otherwi&s;e, he would this morning have moved down and attacked General Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the city and country, It is in your power, by a &s;pirited improvement of the pre&s;ent circum&s;tance, to turn it to a real advantage: Howe is now weaker than before, and every &s;hot will contribute to reduce him. You are more immediately intere&s;ted than any other part of the Continent; your All is at &s;take; it is not &s;o with the general cau&s;e; you are devoted by the enemy to plunder and de&s;truction: It is the encouragement which Howe, the chief of plunderers, has promi&s;ed his army. Thus circum&s;tanced, you may &s;ave your|&s;elves by a manly re&s;i&s;tance, but you can have no hope in
<PB N="60" REF="015495_0004_0F998684A637B100">
any other conduct. I never yet knew our brave General, or any part of the army, officers or men, out of heart, and I have &s;een them in circum&s;tances a thou&s;and times more trying than the pre&s;ent. It is only tho&s;e that are not in action, that feel languor and heavine&s;s, and the be&s;t way to rub it off is to turn out, and make &s;ure work of it.</P>
<P>Our army mu&s;t undoubtedly feel fatigue, and want a re|inforcement of re&s;t, though not of valour. Our own intere&s;t and happine&s;s call upon us to give them every &s;upport in our power, and make the burden of the day, on which the &s;afety of this city depends, as light as po&s;&s;ible. Remember, Gen|tlemen, that we have forces both to the Northward and Southward of Philadelphia, and if the enemy be but &s;topt till tho&s;e can arrive, this city will be &s;aved, and the enemy finally routed. You have too much at &s;take to he&s;itate. You ought not to think an hour upon the matter, but to &s;pring to action at once. Other States have been invaded, and have likewi&s;e driven off the invaders. Now OUR time and turn is come, and perhaps the fini&s;hing &s;troke is re&s;erved for us. When we look back on the dangers we have been &s;aved from, and reflect on the &s;ucce&s;&s;es we have been ble&s;t with, it would be &s;inful either to be idle or de&s;pair.</P>
<P>I clo&s;e this paper with a &s;hort addre&s;s to General Howe. You, &s;ir, are only lingering out the period that &s;hall bring with it your defeat. You have yet &s;carce began upon the war; and the farther you enter, the fa&s;ter will your troubles thicken. What you now enjoy is only a re&s;pite from ruin; an invitation to de&s;truction; a &s;omething, that will lead on to our deliverance at your expence. We know the cau&s;e we are engaged in, and though a pa&s;&s;ionate fondne&s;s for it may make us grieve at every injury which threatens it, yet, when the moment of concern is over, the determination to duty returns. We are not the hireling &s;laves of a beggarly tyrant, nor the cringing flatterers of an infamous court. We are not moved by the gloomy &s;mile of a worthle&s;s king, but by the ardent glow of generous patrioti&s;m. We fight, not to en&s;lave, but to &s;et a country free, and to make room upon the earth for hone&s;t men to live in. In &s;uch a cau&s;e we are &s;ure we are right; and we leave to you the de&s;pairing reflection of being the tool of a mi&s;erable tyrant.</P>
