and &s;o are ju&s;tifyed and made heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven; and this change is made <HI>at once</HI> in the Soul; it is wrought in the twinkleing of an eye. There is wont ordinari|ly to be a great deal of time &s;pent in way of <HI>Preparation</HI> for this change: In order to this change there is wont to be a work of <HI>Contri|tion</HI> and <HI>Humiliation;</HI> and tho' in the primi|tive times we read of men pa&s;&s;ing thro' the work in a very little time, yet ordinarily we find that much time is con&s;umed in the work of Preparation: There be many temptations to be overcome, flatteries and di&s;couragements to be removed; men lo&s;e a great deal of time by falling into &s;lumbers, by backwardne&s;s to reform &s;ome evils, by trying to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, by fearing that they are not elected, or that God has given them up to hardne&s;s of heart, by imagining their hearts to be better than they be, by unwillingne&s;s to own the Ju&s;tice and Sovereignty of God, &s;o that commonly &s;everal months are &s;pent, and &s;ometimes &s;ome years, before they get thro' the work of Preparation; yet Conver&s;ion it &s;elf is wrought at once, in the hearing of one pa&s;&s;age in a Sermon, by the remembring of one Scripture. As it will be in the Re&s;ur|rection, 1 Cor. 15:52. <HI>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the la&s;t trump: for the trumpet &s;hall &s;ound and the dead &s;hall be rai&s;ed incorruptible, and we &s;hall be changed:</HI> So it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in this fir&s;t Re&s;urrection.

<P N="1">1. That <HI>Preparatory Work</HI> is no part of Conver&s;ion. It is an Antecedent to Conver|&s;ion, but no part of Conver&s;ion. Sometimes under the work of Preparation, per&s;ons are &s;o exact in their Conver&s;ation, have &s;uch affecti|ons and Comforts that not only others, but them&s;elves al&s;o think that they are convert|ed; they have very great re&s;emblances of Grace, they have many meltings of heart, de|light in Sabbaths, zeal again&s;t Sin, as do car|ry a great appearance of a gracious Spirit; but all that they attain unto is no part of the work of Conver&s;ion, they remain &s;till in a natural Condition, and their religious affections are but counterfeit Graces. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;eemed to him&s;elf as if he was <HI>alive,</HI> but af|terwards he found him&s;elf <HI>to be dead,</HI> Rom. 7.9. <HI>I was alive without the law once, but when the commandment came, Sin revived and I died.</HI> Men under the work of Preparation are under the dominion and government of Sin, their corruptions are &s;tunded but not mortifyed, they are re&s;trained but not killed, they are like Vermin in the Winter, &s;tupifyed but not dead; and whatever &s;hew they make, they are de&s;titute of Holine&s;s, in all their affections there is no love to God, in all their lamenta|tions for Sin there is no Godly Sorrow; their

religion proceeds only from Natural Con&s;ci|ence and Self-Love: The men are afraid of Hell, that makes them walk orderly, re&s;i&s;t Temptations and be &s;orrowful for Sin; they hope that God is not &s;o angry as he was, that makes them forward in duties of religion; they con&s;ider the moral evil of many &s;inful practices, and that begets &s;ome kind of loath|ing of them; they hope in &s;uch and &s;uch ways to win the favour of God, that makes them forward in duties of Religion and charity; they hope &s;ometimes that God has pardoned them, that makes them have &s;trong affections; but all the&s;e things are no part of Conver&s;ion: it may be &s;aid to them as Chri&s;t &s;aid to the <HI>Jews,</HI> Joh. 15.42. <HI>You have not the love of God in you.</HI> There is not one &s;park of Grace in them: Grace and Holine&s;s is quite of ano|ther kind: When they have gone thro' <HI>Pre|paration</HI> Work, Conver&s;ion remains wholly to be wrought.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the Soul has performed <HI>one holy Action it is converted.</HI> One holy Action may be performed in the twinkling of an eye: An Act of Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t is done at once: And when the Soul has performed one holy Action it is converted: If one holy Action he Performed, there is a principle of Grace in the heart, there is a &s;pirit of Love and Faith and Humility; and &s;uch a per&s;on is in an e&s;tate of Ju&s;tification. There is a very great diffe|rence between <HI>Morality</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> on this ac|count.

A man may carry temperately, cha&s;t|ly or ju&s;tly, a day or two, yet not be a tempe|rate, cha&s;te or ju&s;t man: but if he carries ho|lily one day, or one minute, he is an holy man. If he performs one act of Faith, he is a Believer; if he perform one act of hu|mility, he is a humble man. One act of Grace is an evidence that the mans heart is chan|ged, and that he hath a principle of Grace: Men become morally temperate and cha&s;te by degrees, but they are not made Converts by degrees. The lea&s;t degree of Grace makes a man a Convert, or a Saint. Conver&s;ion may increa&s;e by degrees, men grow more and more holy by degrees, but Conver&s;ion is wrought at once; the fir&s;t act of Grace makes a man a Convert.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> That Grace given in Saving Conver&s;ion differs in Kind from all that went before.</HEAD>
<P>SOme have been of opinion that <HI>&s;aving Grace</HI> and <HI>common Grace</HI> differ only in <HI>de|gree,</HI> that Sorrow for Sin increa&s;es till it becomes &s;aving, and Love to God increa&s;es till it becomes &s;aving: But certainly, &s;aving Grace doth differ <HI>&s;pecifically</HI> from all that went before: <HI>Gracious Actions</HI> are of another nature than <HI>Religious Actions</HI> of natural men. The acts of common Grace may be very &s;trong and powerful: The <HI>affections</HI> of the Children of I&s;rael were very &s;trong when they <HI>&s;ang God's prai&s;e,</HI> P&s;al. 106.12. The <HI>affections</HI> of the <HI>Jews</HI> to Chri&s;t were very &s;trong, when they cryed, <HI>Ho&s;anna to the &s;on of David:</HI> The affections of the <HI>Galations</HI> were &s;trong, when <HI>if it had been po&s;&s;ible they would have plucked out their eyes, and have given them to Paul:</HI> And &s;ometimes the acts of &s;aving Grace are very weak; there may be Godly Sorrow in a low degree; there may be an act of Faith
<PB REF="002072_0008_0FBB7A88A499ACB8">
with a great mixture of Unbelief; there may be true love to God where there is but little love to him: Grace is low and weak at fir&s;t, yea, after thirty years growth it is exceeding defective: Indeed true love to God prizes God above all the world, but that doth not prove that it is in a great degree; there may be a &s;pirit to prize God before all the world, yet but a &s;mall degree of that &s;pirit. Innor|dinate love to the world is an affecting of that as the chief Good; when it is in the low|e&s;t degree, it is &s;o; that is the nature of it. So love to God whether in a greater degree or a le&s;s degree, is an affection to God as the chief Good: The difference between &s;aving and common Grace don't lie in the <HI>degree,</HI> but in the <HI>nature</HI> of them. This may appear,</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e &s;aving Grace acts From <HI>other Motives</HI> and for <HI>another End</HI> than common Grace doth. The difference in motives and end, makes a &s;piritual difference in actions: If men do not act from gracious motives and for gracious ends, they do not the thing that God commands; there is no obedience to God in what they do; they don't attend the will of God: When men <HI>depend on Chri&s;t</HI> to &s;ave them, from the incouragement of their own goodne&s;s, and meerly that they may be deli|vered from Hell, they act quite after another manner than the man doth that depends on Chri&s;t only from the encouragement of his
<PB N="8" REF="002072_0009_0FBB7A8E6A4E3728">
Excellency, and that he may be delivered from Sin as well as from Damnation: When a man <HI>mourns for Sin</HI> becau&s;e it expo&s;es him to con|tempt among men, or wrath from God, or be|cau&s;e of the moral evil of it, he doth quite another thing from that man, who mourns for it becau&s;e it is a wrong to a God of infinite Glory: If his Sorrow were in the highe&s;t de|gree that his nature is capable of, it would not be gracious.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the difference between &s;aving Grace and common Grace lay in the degree, <HI>no man could judge that his Grace is &s;aving,</HI> Men may know that they have &s;aving Grace, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.13. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.10. But if the difference lay in the degree, how &s;hould men go about to deter|mine that their Grace was &s;aving? The man may know that he has a greater degree of confidence, and &s;orrow, and zeal, than formerly he had; he may have rea&s;on to think that he goeth beyond &s;ome other Profe&s;&s;ors in the&s;e things; but upon what foundation can he determine that he hath them in &s;uch a degree as to &s;ecure Salvation? Where has God re|vealed what degree is &s;aving and what is not &s;aving? What warrant has any man to judge him&s;elf in a &s;afe condition, if there be &s;everal degre&s;s of Grace that are not &s;aving? What Rule can any Mini&s;ter lay down to guide men in this matter? Men mu&s;t needs be left in a perpetual uncertainty, and remain in the dark about their eternal e&s;tate. If a man &s;aw that
<PB N="9" REF="002072_0010_0FBB7A8FA7ACD470">
he believed in Chri&s;t, that he repented of his Sins, that he aimed at the Glory of God, it would be little comfort to him, becau&s;e he could not tell that it was in &s;uch a <HI>degree</HI> as to &s;ecure his Salvation.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Grace that is given in Conver&s;ion is <HI>new.</HI> When a man is converted it's wholly new; when God converts a man he gives him a <HI>new heart,</HI> and puts a <HI>new &s;pirit</HI> within him. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.17. He is a <HI>new creature;</HI> not in re&s;pect of his Soul or the Faculties of it&punc; but in re&s;pect of the Inclinations of it. But if common and &s;aving Grace differ only in de|gree, then his Grace is not wholly new, for he has had religious Joys and Sorrows, and a Zeal a long while; before he had &s;aving Grace he had the &s;ame inclinations and &s;pirit, only now it is heightned and increa&s;ed; &s;ome de|grees are new, but the inclinations them&s;elves are not new; &s;o that Conver&s;ion wou'd be not the giving a new heart, but only an augment|ing &s;uch inclinations as were there before.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is an <HI>oppo&s;ition between &s;aving Grace and common Grace:</HI> If one be oppo&s;ite to the other, then they differ &s;pecifically: Tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions that have contratriety one to the other, that are at war one with the other, and would de&s;troy one another, are not of the &s;ame kind; and truly the&s;e are &s;o: Common Graces are Lu&s;ts, and do oppo&s;e &s;aving Grace: Making his own Salvation his la&s;t end, is contrary to making the Glory of
<PB N="10" REF="002072_0011_0FBB7A90EC7852B8">
God his la&s;t end: Hating Sin, not becau&s;e it wrongs God, but becau&s;e it expo&s;es him, is re&s;i&s;ting the Command of God: Bringing eve|ry thing into &s;ub&s;erviency to his own ends, is oppo&s;ite to the bringing every thing into a &s;ub|&s;erviency to God's Glory: The man that has but common Grace goeth quite in ano|ther path than that which God directs unto: When he goeth about to e&s;tabli&s;h his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, he &s;ets him&s;elf again&s;t that way of Salvation God pre&s;cribes, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.3. There is an enmity in the ways of &s;uch men as have but common Grace, to the ways that godly men take.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Habitual and Actual Conver&s;ion are wrought together.</HEAD>
<P>THo&s;e holy <HI>Habits</HI> and Inclinations that God puts into the hearts of his People, are not vi&s;ible in them&s;elves; men cannot di&s;cern them but by their <HI>actings:</HI> As men are not able to &s;ee their own Souls, &s;o they are not able to &s;ee tho&s;e habits that are in them, but only by their actings: They have a power to reflect on the operations of their hearts, and &s;o come to the knowledge of tho&s;e habits that are in them; but they cannot &s;ee
<PB N="11" REF="002072_0012_0FBB7A9263C9A6D0">
tho&s;e habits immediately: Hence no man is able upon his experience to tell the very mi|nute when the habits of Grace were put into him: And generally men have thought that: the habits of Grace are put into men before their clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t; and they have been wont to argue in that manner, that there mu&s;t be holy principles before holy actions, there mu&s;t be life before there be life acts: But there is no nece&s;&s;ity of this; the faculty of acting, mu&s;t be before the action, the cau&s;e mu&s;t be before the effect; the man mu&s;t have a being before he can have any operation; but it doth not follow from thence, that there mu&s;t be a gracious habit before there be any gracious action: There is no nece&s;&s;ity that there be an <HI>antecedent habit,</HI> it is &s;uffici|ent if there be a <HI>concomitant habit</HI> and inclina|tion. There was no nece&s;&s;ity that <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;hould have an habit of Love to <HI>Rachel</HI> before he actually loved her; that <HI>Michal</HI> &s;hould have an habit of loving <HI>David</HI> before &s;he actually loved him; there was no nece&s;&s;ity that <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> &s;hould have an habitual inclination to Sin before they <HI>did &s;in:</HI> So, there is no nece&s;&s;ity that men &s;hould have an inclination to believe in Chri&s;t and love God, before they do actually believe in Chri&s;t and love God; it is &s;ufficient that there be a concomitant inclination that way: And thus it is from time to time; wherever there is an act of Faith and Love, there is a di&s;po&s;ition to act
<PB N="12" REF="002072_0013_0FBB7A93DA3D0698">
&s;o for the time to come; but there is no ne|ce&s;&s;ity in Nature that the inclination &s;hould be antecedent.</P>
<P>And this &s;uppo&s;ition of an antecedent gra|cious inclination before actual Conver&s;ion, is attended with this in&s;uparable difficulty; That a man may have gracious habits, and yet be in a &s;tate of condemnation; that he may have a &s;anctified heart, yet be for a time under the Cur&s;e; that his heart may be chan|ged, and yet abide for a time under the Cur&s;e. That he may be &s;anctified yet not ju&s;tified; for there is no Ju&s;tification till there is actual Faith. When it is &s;aid in Scripture that we are ju&s;tified by Faith, the meaning is not that we are ju&s;tified by an habit of Faith, but actu|al Faith; for that Faith is &s;et forth by words &s;ignifying Action; by believing on Chri&s;t, receiving Chri&s;t, coming to Chri&s;t, opening to him: It is &s;aid of <HI>Abraham,</HI> he <HI>be|lieved in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Gen. 15.6. The Condition of Ju&s;tification mu&s;t be wrought by us; thence it is actual Faith that is intended: A di&s;po&s;i|tion to yield perfect obedience was not the fulfilling the Condition of the Covenant of Works; if that would have done, <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> would have been ju&s;tified us &s;oon as they were made. So a di&s;po&s;ition to believe is not a fulfilling the Condition of the Covenant of Grace; but actual believing.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002072_0014_0FBB7A954E10FF78">Moreover, it is evident that habitual and actual Conver&s;ion are together, becau&s;e both of them are effected by the &s;ame divine act, <HI>viz.</HI> The di&s;covery of the <HI>truth and glory of the Go&s;pel.</HI> I am far from thinking that God is tied up unto this way; or that he cannot give the habits of Grace without &s;uch a di&s;|covery; but it is evident from the Word of God that he doth work the habit of Grace, and draws forth the act of Grace in this way: That he doth give this principle &amp; gracious inclina|tion in this way is plainly taught; 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>We all with open face beholding as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame image from glory to glory, by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> Changing into the image of God is by giving the habits of Grace unto them; beholding the glory of God as in a Gla&s;s is the di&s;cerning the Glory of God in the Go&s;pel. We are taught the &s;ame al&s;o in 1 Cor. 4.15. <HI>I have begotten you through the Go&s;pel.</HI> In Re|generation men do receive the habits of Grace, the heart is renewed, and the man is made a new man; and this is wrought thro' the Go&s;|pel, by the Go&s;pel, as <HI>under&s;tood;</HI> for it is in this way and no other that the Go&s;pel hath any gracious Efficacy on the heart: If a man hears the Go&s;pel twenty years, and has not the &s;piritual under&s;tanding of it, it will have no gracious effect upon him; but he di&s;covers what a glorious way of Salvation God has prepared, and that works a great change in his
<PB N="14" REF="002072_0015_0FBB7A96C8D4E8F8">
heart: The &s;ame is taught, Jam. 1.18. <HI>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth:</HI> that is, by the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> which he calls the <HI>word of truth</HI> by way of excellency, and be|cau&s;e the truth of it was que&s;tioned by the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Heathens.</HI></P>
<P>And by this di&s;covery God draws forth the exerci&s;e of Faith at the &s;ame time; that di&s;covery makes men immediately to receive the Go&s;pel. When men have a &s;piritual &s;ight of Chri&s;t, they will believe on him; if they with&s;tood the calls before and objected, they will be prevailed on by that &s;ight; Joh. 1.40. <HI>This is the will of him that &s;ent me, that every one that &s;eeth the &s;on and believeth on him may have everlasting life.</HI> And v. 45. <HI>Every man that hath beard and learned of the Father co|meth unto me.</HI></P>
<P>It is al&s;o impo&s;&s;ible in Nature but that men when they do believe in Chri&s;t &s;hould have an inclination or di&s;po&s;ition to come to him. Men may do &s;ome things out of a kind of compul&s;ion, and do them upon &s;ome accidental, by con&s;ideration, and yet hate to do them at the &s;ame time: But the accepting of Chri&s;t is always an act of great freedom; when they do it, they do it out of choice: P&s;al. 110.3. <HI>Thy people &s;hall be willing in the day of thy power.</HI> They do it from conviction of the preciou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t and benefit of coming to him; they love to come, and have a di&s;po&s;ition to do &s;o for the future.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Believing in Chri&s;t is the fir&s;t Act of Conver&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>MEN that are converted do exerci&s;e all manner of Grace; They perform acts of Love, and Fear, and Submi&s;&s;ion, and godly Sorrow, and Patience, and Humility; but the fir&s;t act of Conver&s;ion is to <HI>believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> There is no other gracious act that goeth before Faith. In <HI>this re&s;pect</HI> Conver&s;ion is wrought after the &s;ame manner in all that are converted: After the fir&s;t act of Grace there is no certain order in the exerci&s;e of Graces, but this act of believing in Chri&s;t has the preceeding in all. Some men don't make a beginning in Godline&s;s in loving God, and others in &s;orrow for Sin, and others in patience, and others in humility; but they all begin by <HI>receiving Christ as offered in the Go&s;pel:</HI> Fal&s;e Conver&s;ions begin &s;ome in one way and &s;ome in another, but &s;aving Conver|&s;ion always begins with believing in Chri&s;t.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> This Act of Faith doth include all other Graces.</HEAD>
<P>THE act of Faith in accepting Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the <HI>Conver&s;ion of the whole Soul unto God:</HI> for it is vertually all Grace, it in|cludes in it &s;omewhat of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of all other Graces: There is a di&s;tinction in the exerci&s;e of &s;everal Graces; there is a difference between the acts of Faith, and Love, and Repentance, and Humility; yet there is &s;omewhat of the &s;pirit of every Grace working in the Soul's fir&s;t clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a <HI>believing of the Word of God.</HI> God &s;peaks a great deal in the Go&s;pel to en|courage Sinn is to come to Chri&s;t. He tells us, that he calls us, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God, that he is appointed to be a Prince and a Saviour, that he died for our Sins, that he has &s;atisfyed the Ju&s;tice of God, that he is ri&s;en from the dead, and &s;its at the right hand of God, that he will of his free Grace pardon all the Sins of tho&s;e that come to him; and the man when he comes to Chri&s;t receives the whole <HI>Doctrine of the Go&s;pel</HI> as the <HI>true &s;ayings of God:</HI> He rejects all carnal rea&s;ons, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ts his &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> true,</HI> He made a Profe&s;&s;ion before, but now

he don't <HI>stagger at the promi&s;e of God through unbelief;</HI> he is &s;atisfyed that <HI>the Go&s;pel is no cunningly devi&s;ed fable,</HI> but the very Word of God; 1 The&s;. 2.13, <HI>Ye received the word not as the word of man, but as it is in truth the word of God, which effectually worketh in you that believe:</HI> They dont look upon it as pro|bable as they did before, but have the a&s;&s;u|rance of the truth of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is <HI>Love to God and Christ.</HI> When the Soul marries to Chri&s;t, he doth it with a &s;pirit of Love; He takes God as his Por|tion, he takes his &s;atisfaction in God; he comes to God not for &s;ome Conveniency but for Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, he takes him as one that is &s;ufficient to make him happy; he de&s;pi&s;es all the world in compari&s;on of God: He takes a complacency in God, and &s;ees the gloriou&s;ne&s;s and amiablene&s;s of God: The love of God ap|pearing in the Go&s;pel draws his heart. He loves to <HI>depend on Je&s;us Christ,</HI> and to put <HI>honour upon him.</HI> This way of Salvation plea&s;es him, he looks upon Chri&s;t excellent and glorious, he extols Chri&s;t: Cant. 5.11. <HI>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefe&s;t of ten thou&s;ands.</HI> and v. 16. <HI>He is altogether lite|ly.</HI> His coming to Chri&s;t is not a forced thing; but he e&s;teems him <HI>fairer than the children of men,</HI> P&s;al. 45 2.</P>

God re&s;trains the corruptions of men before he puts Grace into them; and takes away much of tho&s;e evil habits that men had contracted by a Cour&s;e of Sin: He doth that by terrifying the Con|&s;cience, giving &s;ome common encouragements, and by humane re&s;traints, &amp; education; but it is by giving Grace to the Soul that corrupti|on is mortifyed. Corruption is not mortifyed before the infu&s;ion of Grace, neither is the infu&s;ion of Grace before mortification; but they are wrought at once by the &s;ame act.</P>

way wherein God communicates Grace is by teaching men how glorious he is. He lets in <HI>Go&s;pel Light,</HI> and &s;o works gracious inclina|tions. Men &s;ee the <HI>rea&s;on</HI> why they &s;hould love God, tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, and be humble, and this inclines the heart that way. God deals with men as with rational creatures; he di&s;|covers to them the <HI>Rea&s;on and Foundation</HI> of holy carriages, and &s;o di&s;po&s;es the heart to them: 2 Cor. 4.18. <HI>We all beholding as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame image.</HI> He makes them know him|&s;elf, and &s;o makes them &s;incere. P&s;al. 36, 10. <HI>Stretch forth thy loving kindne&s;s to them that know thee, and thy righteou&s;ne&s;s to the upright in heart.</HI> He teaches them, and &s;o they come to Chri&s;t: Joh. 6.45. <HI>Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me.</HI> And it is the &s;ame way that he mortifies their corruption. This light weans them from the world, kills the pride of their hearts. This light makes them hate the ways of Sin. At the &s;ame time that they &s;ee rea&s;on to exalt God, they &s;ee the evil of pride. When they &s;ee rea&s;on to love God, they &s;ee that there is no rea&s;on to dote on the world, Act. 26.18. <HI>To turn them from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan to God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 2. Natural Corruption is nothing el&s;e but the privation of Holine&s;s. Contracted habits have &s;omething po&s;itive in them, but natural corruption is only the privation of
<PB N="28" REF="002072_0029_0FBB7ABF49404940">
Holine&s;s. When Man lo&s;t the image of God, there was nothing po&s;itive put into him. The condition of man by nature is, that he is de&s;titute of Love, and Faith, and Humility; and thence he runs into evil, and is di&s;po&s;ed to love the world, and &s;et up him&s;elf above God. This &s;hews that the very giving of Grace mortifies corruption. When the habit is given, the privation is expell'd. When light comes into the eye, the darkne&s;s is gone: When &s;ight is given to men, blindne&s;s is ta|ken away: When life came into <HI>Lazarus,</HI> he was delivered from Death: When love to God is put into the Soul, innordinate &s;elf-love is mortifyed. When Faith is wrought in the heart, Unbelief is mortifyed. When men are made humble, their Pride is morti|fyed. When God conveys &s;piritual Life to men, without any more to do, they are deli|vered from &s;piritual Death: Rom. 8.2. <HI>The law of the &s;pirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, has made me free from the law of &s;in and of death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 3. Holine&s;s doth imply in it a hatred to Sin. Where Sin is hated it is mortifyed; that was <HI>Paul's</HI> &s;pirit, Rom. 7.15. <HI>What I hate, that I do.</HI> When Sin is hated, then the &s;trength of it is abated. The &s;trength of Sin lies in men's <HI>love</HI> to Sin. Wherever Sin is hated as the greate&s;t evil it is mortified: As it lo&s;eth the love of men, &s;o it lo&s;eth it's &s;trength. That was a &s;ign of <HI>David's</HI> morti|fication, that he hated vain thoughts, <HI>P&s;al.</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="002072_0030_0FBB7AC0CFE78498">
119.113. And wherever there is Holine&s;s there is an hatred of Sin. If the heart of a man be inclined to believe, he hates unbelief; unbelief is contrary to that inclination: So, if a man have an inclination to love God as his chief Good, he will hate the workings of pride and worldline&s;s, the &s;etting up any other thing above God. Sinful inclinations are enemies to Holine&s;s, and holy inclinations are enemies to Sin. They have a tendency in them&s;elves to de&s;troy one another: Gal. 5.17. <HI>The fle&s;h lu&s;teth again&s;t the &s;pirit, and the &s;pirit again&s;t the fle&s;h, and the&s;e are contrary one to the other.</HI> There is a warfare between Grace and Corruption, they &s;eek the de&s;tructi|on of one another.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 4. The more degrees of Grace men get, the more Sin is mortifyed. The more men put on the new man, the more they put off the old man. Holine&s;s and Mortification hold an exact proportion one to the other. As one Scale ri&s;es, the other falls: As water comes into the ve&s;&s;el, the air is expelled: The more light is in the air, the le&s;s darkne&s;s: 2 Sam. 3.1. <HI>David waxed stronger and &s;tron|ger, and the hou&s;e of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</HI> As Grace flouri&s;heth, &s;o Sin dies. Whenever there is any addition to Grace, there is a proportionable &s;ub&s;traction from Corruption. The more humility, the le&s;s pride. They that are very humble, are not very proud.

<P>Two things will make this evident.</P>

of God. When God opens the eyes of men, and gives &s;piritual under&s;tanding to them, there are two ways wherein they may &s;ee the glory of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. By <HI>rea&s;oning from the works of Creation and common Providence.</HI> There is a great di&s;co|very of the glory of God in making the world, P&s;al. 19.1. <HI>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament &s;heweth his handy works.</HI> I&s;ai. 6.3. <HI>The whole earth is full of his glory.</HI> And when they behold the work of God, they may readily &s;ee, if their eyes be opened, that the&s;e things were made by a God of in|finite power, and wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s. There is a &s;elf-evidencing light in the&s;e works of God, &s;hewing that they are the effects of a God of infinite glory. The world is a gla&s;s, reflecting the glory of God; and when men's eyes are opened, they may plainly &s;ee it. So in other of the great works of God; the ge|neral deluge, the burning of Sodom, the de|livery of I&s;rael out of Egypt, maintaining them in the wilderne&s;s, &amp;c. God often puts us in mind, that he has <HI>created the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth.</HI> That is an abundant manife&s;tation to them that un|der&s;tand, that he is a glorious God, worthy to be believed, and loved, and obeyed. When men's eyes are opened, they &s;ee the force of the argument, they are at once &s;atisfyed about the glorious properties of God.

<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 2.

<P>MUltitudes that are called to come, do upon one occa&s;ion or other excu&s;e them&s;elves: Yea, men that are in great di|&s;tre&s;s for the want of forgivene&s;s, do reject the offer. They would fain be pardoned, &amp; pray to God to accept them upon Chri&s;t's account; but they dare not accept of the offer of mercy. They have all manner of per&s;wa&s;ions but re|main unper&s;wadable; they re&s;olve to do it, they may attempt it, but don't effect it: It &s;eems a dangerous thing, and a method to ca&s;t away their own &s;ouls; they think God would be very angry with them for obtruding them&s;elves upon him: It &s;eems to them a de&s;perate adventure. But when they are <HI>convinced of the gloriou&s;ne&s;s of God, they &s;ee encouragement enough to come to Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;ee three things e&s;pecially that are encouragement to them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>free Grace of God.</HI> They were wont to di&s;courage them&s;elves becau&s;e of their unworthine&s;s; it &s;eemed to them as if the heart of God was turned again&s;t them, and
<PB N="44" REF="002072_0045_0FBB7AE5B0A5C7F8">
they laboured in that that they might get &s;omething to incline the heart of God towards them, that might appea&s;e his anger, and at|tract his love: But when they have the know|ledge of God, they are &s;atisfyed in the free|ne&s;s of his grace; they &s;ee that there is enough in his own heart to move him, that there is an infinite ocean of grace there, that his thoughts are not as our thoughts, that there is an <HI>height and depth, and length and breadth in the love of God,</HI> that it <HI>pa&s;&s;eth knowledge;</HI> that he can pity his greate&s;t ene|mies, and love tho&s;e that have nothing to commend them.

His grace is &s;overeign grace, and he has <HI>mercy on whom he will have mercy.</HI> Though it be a great thing to be pardoned and &s;aved, yet it is not too much for him to do. There is no need of any thing to move his heart; he can do it becau&s;e it plea&s;eth him. They were wont formerly to limit the mercy of God, and to think it would have been &s;ufficient, if they had not been &s;uch great &s;inners, or if they were more broken for their &s;ins; but now they are convinced, that if they were wor&s;e than they are, that the mercy of God is &s;ufficient for them; that there is an infinitene&s;s in the grace of God; and after they have reckoned up many things that grace can do, that there is infinitely more than they can think of.

an account the next hour. Men have not at that time the actual under&s;tanding of all go&s;pel principles: Indeed they &s;aw that that way of Salvation that they had been for ma|ny years in&s;tructed in was true; but they have not the actual under&s;tanding of them at the very time: Yet they did &s;ee, and actu|ally under&s;tood at the time, a great deal more than they can remember.</P>
<P>This may appear by the&s;e things,</P>
<P N="1">1. From the <HI>&s;hortne&s;s of the time</HI> wherein this di&s;covery is made. There is but a very little time between the opening of the eyes, and the hearts clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t, &amp; the di&s;|covery is wont to la&s;t but a little time; and &s;o it is impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould have a di&s;tinct remembrance of every thing that he &s;aw, The <HI>Spou&s;e</HI> gives a very particular de&s;cription of Chri&s;t in figurative expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>Cant.</HI> 5. <HI>from v.</HI> 16. <HI>ad fin.</HI> And &s;o Godly men are able to do from what they find in the word of God; but they can remember but a little account of what they &s;aw at that time.

So, if a man &s;hould ca&s;t his eye upon a beautiful Per&s;on, he is much affected with his beauty; but he can't give a particular account of all his features, the comeline&s;s of his forehead, eyes, cheeks and lips, nor give
<PB N="50" REF="002072_0051_0FBB7AF48B2CFE10">
a de&s;cription of them. If a man &s;hould ca&s;t his eye upon a <HI>Garden</HI> wherein there is a variety of flowers, he may be much affected with it, yet not able to tell particularly what &s;orts of flowers he &s;aw. Or if he &s;hould ca&s;t his eye upon a curious piece of <HI>Embroidery,</HI> he may perceive immediately that there is much curio&s;ity in it; but he can't give an account of all the colours and re&s;em|blances that he ca&s;t his eye upon. Thus it is when men's eyes are opened. They &s;ee the way of Salvation to be a glorious way, but they can't tell particularly all that they &s;aw; they had but a tran&s;ient &s;ight, and could not take &s;uch di&s;tinct notice of things, as to lay them up in their memory.</P>

God him&s;elf that makes the offer in the Go&s;|pel: Nothing le&s;s than that can be an en|couragement to accept.

And there is no godly man that can re|cover the remembrance of it, that at that time he &s;aw all the&s;e things. Some can re|member more than others; but none can call to mind all that he &s;aw at that time.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e at that time men's thoughts are &s;o fixed upon <HI>one or two particular things,</HI> that they are hindered thereby from remembring &s;ome other things.

Some men at the time had their thoughts more taken up about the <HI>Sacrifice of Christ,</HI> how he has born the cur&s;e, bought us with a price, made his Soul an offering for Sin, fully &s;atisfyed the Ju&s;tice of God. And &s;ome others have their thoughts at the time more fixed upon the <HI>Faithfulne&s;s of God,</HI> that his <HI>words are pure words,</HI> that he is <HI>not as a man that he &s;hould lie, nor the Son of man that he &s;hould repent;</HI> that his word is a &s;ure foundation to build upon. It is frequently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o afterwards. They are led into it &s;ometime by the con&s;ideration of &s;ome <HI>Scripture</HI> that comes to mind at that time.

Many &s;inners are concerned to get the pardon of &s;in; and they re&s;olve to come to Chri&s;t, and they &s;trive to come to Chri&s;t, but they cannot; it &s;eems to them a dangerous thing to venture them&s;elves on Chri&s;t, and they cannot overcome their fears: They &s;et many incouraging con&s;iderations before them|&s;elves, but they cannot vanqui&s;h their fears; they dare not for their heart venture upon Chri&s;t: They are as unable to come as a man that is bound with chains is to come out of pri&s;on.

When men &s;ee the preciou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, it mightily &s;uits them to come to him; they take a complacency in coming to Chri&s;t. Some men force them|&s;elves after a fa&s;hion to venture on Chri&s;t; but when they &s;ee the divine authority of the go&s;pel, they love to come to him, as the hungry man loves to eat, and the thir&s;ty to drink. Acts 16.34. <HI>He rejoyced, believing in God.</HI> He &s;ees that that makes it plea&s;ant to him; he &s;ees that God is worthy of that honour: He is a God of &s;uch grace and faith|fulne&s;s, that he is worthy to be tru&s;ted in; and he &s;ees that the honour of a glorious Mediator is due to Chri&s;t; and he &s;ees that it is a &s;afe thing to come to Chri&s;t. There is no re&s;t any where el&s;e for the &s;ole of his foot, but Chri&s;t is a &s;ure foundation, a pre|cious corner &s;tone: His heart takes content|ment in relying upon him: All the world &s;hall not per&s;wade him to for&s;ake him, and make choice of any other refuge.

The &s;ight of the excellency of

<P N="3">3. This Spiritual light <HI>makes the heart &s;tand bent that way.</HI> This doth not only draw forth gracious actings, but leaves an Impre&s;&s;ion and Bias upon the heart that way.

This &s;ight changes the mind and makes men judge otherwi&s;e of God and Chri&s;t than they u&s;ed to do, and it chan|ges the heart and inclines it to carry &s;uitably.

<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e rational convictions there are <HI>affecting di&s;coveries</HI> of divine truths by the <HI>common work of the Spirit</HI> which make for a time a con&s;iderable impre&s;&s;ion on the heart.

<P>The&s;e two &s;orts of illumination, are re&s;em|blances of a <HI>twofold &s;piritual Illmmination</HI> that &s;aints have. One is by &s;anctified rea&s;on, whereby men are convinced of divine truths. Men under&s;tand the divine authority of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Scripture, and thereby they are a&s;&s;ured of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> truth of Promi&s;es and Threatnings: They are a&s;&s;ured that God made the world, and from thence they are convinced of his eternal Power and Godhead: They know that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the eternal Son of God, and there|by they know the &s;aving vertue of his Blood.</P>
<P>The other is by &s;pecial di&s;coveries of di|vine truths. They are led into <HI>Chri&s;t's cham|bers,</HI> as the 'phra&s;e is, <HI>Cant.</HI> 1.4. God breaks into the heart by divine light, and gives great di&s;coveries of his faithfulne&s;s, of his holine&s;s, his grace, the delight he takes in the &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t, and many other things. 2 Cor. 4.6. <HI>God hath &s;hined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Je&s;us Christ.</HI> Both the&s;e ways of conviction &s;eem to be intimated, Eph. 1.17. <HI>That God may give unto you, the &s;pirit of wi&s;|dom and revelation in the knowledge of him.</HI></P>
<P>The difference between tho&s;e convictions that ri&s;e from the improvement of natural rea&s;on, and that do ari&s;e from &s;piritual rea&s;on, lies in the&s;e two things.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="72" REF="002072_0073_0FBB7B278EE63198">1. Natural rea&s;on <HI>doth not di&s;cover the Cer|tainty of divine things.</HI> Sanctified rea&s;on doth &s;ee them to be <HI>&s;ure,</HI> Joh. 6.69. <HI>We believe and are &s;ure that thou art Chri&s;t the Son of the living God.</HI> Joh. 17.8. <HI>They have known that I came from thee, and they have believed that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hou hast &s;ent me.</HI> Heb. 11.1. <HI>Faith is the evi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ence of things not &s;een.</HI> 1 The&s;. 2.13. <HI>They received the word not as the word of man, but as it is indeed the word of God.</HI> But natural rea&s;on doth not di&s;cover the <HI>Certainty</HI> of di|vine truths: That can perceive the connecti|on between one divine truth and another, and perceive how one thing follows certainly from another; but it doth not perceive the certainty of any. Carnal mens rea&s;oning is from &s;uppo&s;ition; they rea&s;on very rationally, but they do not &s;ee that which is the founda|tion of their rea&s;oning to be certain. Carnal men and Godly men do both of them argue from the divine Nature of Chri&s;t. Both car|nal men and godly do &s;trongly argue, that if Chri&s;t be the Son of God, there is a divine vertue in his &s;ufferings; and that it is &s;afe relying on him. But here lies the difference; the godly man <HI>knows</HI> that Chri&s;t is the Son of God, <HI>Mat.</HI> 16.6. but the carnal man only <HI>&s;up|po&s;es</HI> that Chri&s;t is the Son of God. He &s;ays the Church believe it, the Old and New Te&s;tament give an account of it, and there be many things &s;aid that make much for the confirmation of it. He di&s;covered the &s;ecret
<PB N="73" REF="002072_0074_0FBB7B290103E340">
thoughts of men, did many miraculous works, ro&s;e from the dead. Upon &s;uch accounts he &s;uppo&s;es him to be the Son of God, and judges it a heinous crime for any to deny it; but he doth not know the&s;e things, for he is ignorant of the divine authority of the word, and dare not venture on Chri&s;t, for fear it &s;hould not be &s;o. So it was with the <HI>Jews,</HI> they did not believe <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> Joh. 5.46. Thus they both of them argue from the <HI>Types</HI> and <HI>Sacraments.</HI> The godly man argues, that there were &s;everal types in&s;tituted by God, to &s;hew the &s;aving vertue of the blood of Chri&s;t; &mdash; the &s;acraments in the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> are in&s;tituted to be amemorial of Chri&s;t, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.24. The god|ly man argues from hence, that Chri&s;t has &s;atis|fyed the ju&s;tice of God; that Chri&s;t was the lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.7. The&s;e &s;acrifices were only types of Chri&s;t, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.17. And he is abundantly &s;atisfyed by the&s;e in&s;titutions, that Chri&s;t is a glorious Saviour. Another man argues in like manner, that God would never have appointed &s;uch Signs to &s;ignify Chri&s;t, if he would not have us tru&s;t in him. He has not appointed the&s;e &s;igns to deceive us; God would never teach his people a fal&s;e way of Salvation: But his wound is, that he don't know certainly the divine authority of tho&s;e in&s;titutions; he doth not know but they were the inventions of men. So, they both of them argue &s;trongly from the command to be|lieve,
<PB N="74" REF="002072_0075_0FBB7B2AA683AA38">
from the promi&s;es of Salvation in a way of believing, from Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion and &s;itting at the right hand of God; but the carnal man is uncertain of tho&s;e things that are foundations of his rea&s;oning; he does not know but there is &s;ome mi&s;take: He thinks that there is a great probability of the truth of tho&s;e things, but he has no a&s;&s;urance: His principles are grounded on an uncertain pro|po&s;ition; and &s;o he <HI>knows nothing as he ought to know.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Carnal rea&s;on doth not <HI>receive a right Idea of divine things.</HI> Godly men though they have the exerci&s;e of &s;piritual rea&s;on, can|not find out the Almighty unto perfection: But yet they do know God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Joh.</HI> 17.3. They have a true idea of God; they know him to be one of infinite perfecti|on; they know him to be a God of infinite power, grace and faithfulne&s;s; they are con|vinced that he is worthy of that love, faith and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion that he calls for; P&s;al. 18.3. <HI>I will call upon God who is worthy to be prai&s;ed.</HI> They know that divine honour is due to him; P&s;al. 29.2. <HI>Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name.</HI> But carnal men have not a right idea of God: They acknowledge that he is infinite in his perfections, and can give &s;ome de&s;cription of his infinite perfections; but they have not a right <HI>Idea</HI> of his glori|ous nature, are not &s;en&s;ible what reverence and glory is due to him; and therefore they

are &s;aid to be ignorant of him: Joh. 4.8. <HI>He that loveth not, knoweth not God.</HI></P>
<P>The difference between tho&s;e affecting illu|minations that carnal men have, &mdash; tho&s;e di&s;co|veries that are given to godly men, lies in the&s;e two particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. The illuminations that carnal men have, are <HI>affecting,</HI> but not <HI>convincing.</HI> They are many times much affected with <HI>Joy;</HI> &s;o they &s;aid, <HI>What a ble&s;&s;edne&s;s is it!</HI> when <HI>Paul</HI> preached the go&s;pel unto them, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.15. It works de&s;ires in them, <HI>Luk.</HI> 14.15. And their hearts upon that occa&s;ion may be migh|tily weaned from the world, and taken up a|bout heavenly things: They may be mightily tran&s;ported with zeal. The people of the <HI>Jews</HI> were &s;o affected with Chri&s;t, that they were of the mind to <HI>make him a King.</HI> But the&s;e illuminations don't convince them; the men remain ignorant of God, and Chri&s;t, and the truth of the go&s;pel. The&s;e fla&s;hes of light do not di&s;cover the certainty of divine truths. The people that cry <HI>Ho&s;anna</HI> to day, cry <HI>crucify him</HI> another time; and that was a &s;ign that they did not know him; <HI>for had they known, they would not have crucifyed the Lord of glo|ry,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.8. Many are greatly affected in the hearing of &s;ermons, that do not firmly be|lieve what they hear: Act. 25.48. <HI>When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glori|fied the word of the Lord; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</HI> They were
<PB N="76" REF="002072_0077_0FBB7B31D8869850">
generally much affected, but it was only a <HI>&s;elect number</HI> that believed. <HI>Stony ground hearers</HI> are much affected, but not convinced. Men are often affected with &s;uch things as they look upon as probable; but &s;pecial di&s;|coveries that God makes to &s;aints, are very affecting and <HI>convincing.</HI> Godly men mu&s;t needs be affected with tho&s;e di&s;coveries, for they are wondrous in their eyes: P&s;al. 119.18. <HI>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold the wondrous things in thy law.</HI> Sometimes the <HI>love of God</HI> is &s;aid to be <HI>&s;hed abroad in their hearts;</HI> that implies great affection, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.5. Divine truths are of a very affecting nature; They will &s;tir up joy, and &s;orrow, and de&s;ires, and zeal; but the&s;e di&s;coveries do not affect them only, but convince them: They &s;ee the glory of God; P&s;al. 63.2. <HI>To &s;ee thy power and glory, &s;o as I have &s;een thee in the &s;anctu|ary.</HI> They know the love of Chri&s;t that pa&s;&s;eth knowledge, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.19. When they be|hold the glory of God, they are convinced of the glory of God, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.18. When God &s;hines into their hearts, he gives the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.6. When men &s;ee the &s;un, they know it is the &s;un; and when they &s;ee the grace and faith|fulne&s;s of God, they know he is &s;uch an one; they don't only &s;ee the gloriou&s;ne&s;s of mercy, and holine&s;s, and faithfulne&s;s; but that God is gracious, and holy, and faithful.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="77" REF="002072_0078_0FBB7B35235ADF70">2. The illuminations of carnal men <HI>don't draw forth any gracious Exerci&s;es.</HI> The com|mon di&s;coveries that are given to carnal men, have a con&s;iderable effect upon them; be&s;ides the &s;tirring up of affections &s;poken of before, they have an effect upon the conver&s;ation; they many times make men to <HI>reform</HI> their lives, and ca&s;t of &s;inful practices: 2 Pet. 2.20. <HI>They e&s;cape the pollutions of the world thro' the knowledge of Chri&s;t.</HI> Sometimes they en|courage men in &s;eeking the pardon of their &s;ins. They may have &s;uch a di&s;covery of the happine&s;s of heaven, of the graciou&s;ne&s;s of God, and of the mercy of God in providing a way of &s;alvation, as may greatly encourage them to continue &s;eeking his favour. They may likewi&s;e have that effect to make men pre&s;umptuous. Men may from thence con|clude their own e&s;tate good: They may take encouragements for a&s;&s;urances of the favour of God: May take occa&s;ion al&s;o from them to get a fal&s;e faith. If they have &s;ome di&s;co|veries of a readine&s;s in God to pardon &s;inners, they may take incouragement to think, that men &s;o qualified as they, that are reformed and &s;orry for their &s;ins, may be bold to ven|ture on Chri&s;t: But tho&s;e &s;piritual di&s;cove|ries that God makes, do always draw forth the exerci&s;e of grace: Cant. 1.4. <HI>The king hath brought me to his chambers, we will be glad and delight in thee; the upright love thee.</HI> When God breaks into the heart by light,
<PB N="78" REF="002072_0079_0FBB7B369D178668">
the heart is drawn forth in love, and faith, and repentance. Communion is reciprocal. When God draws nigh to his People, that mightily &s;tirs up a &s;pirit of holine&s;s; it doth not only &s;trengthen a&s;&s;urance, but it &s;tirs up all grace: Job. 42.5, 6. <HI>Now mine eye &s;eeth thee, wherefore I abhor my &s;elf, and repent in dust and a&s;hes.</HI> Eph. 3.19. <HI>And to know the love of Chri&s;t that pa&s;&s;eth knowledge; that ye might be filled with all the fulne&s;s of God.</HI> This gives great increa&s;e to grace. 2 Pet. 1.2. <HI>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you, through the knowledge of God and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>

<P>MEn may have the knowledge of their own conver&s;ion. The knowledge that other men have of it is uncertain; becau&s;e no man can look into the heart of another, and &s;ee the workings of grace there: Yet men may know that they are godly. Some ungodly men think that they have grace; but that which is not, cannot be known: Things that are not, are called, <HI>things that do not appear,</HI> Heb. 11.3. <HI>That which is wanting cannot be numbred,</HI> Eccl. 1.15. All converted men don't know that they are converted. Tho' grace

be vi&s;ible, yet many times it is not &s;een. Vi&s;ible things are not always &s;een; &s;ometimes becau&s;e it is night, &s;ometimes becau&s;e they are covered. It is the <HI>Calamity,</HI> and many times the <HI>Iniquity</HI> of godly men that they are ignorant of their conver&s;ion. They do know that they have corruptions in them, and they may know that they have grace in them. This is very evident, becau&s;e many godly men have known their good e&s;tate. If this knowledge had never been attained, it might more rea&s;onably be que&s;tioned, whe|ther it were attainable. <HI>Job</HI> was abundant|ly &s;atisfyed; Job. 10.7. <HI>Thou knowest that I am not wicked:</HI> And he was not mi&s;taken, <HI>Job.</HI> 1.1. So <HI>David</HI> knew it; P&s;al. 17.15. <HI>As for me, I &s;hall behold his face in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> So <HI>Paul;</HI> 2 Tim. 4.7. <HI>I have fought the good fight, I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, I have kept the faith.</HI> v. 8. <HI>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And we don't know of one godly man in the <HI>Scripture</HI> that was under darkne&s;s about his &s;incerity.

But that <HI>P&s;alm</HI> repre&s;ents to us not the par|ticular ca&s;e of <HI>Haman,</HI> but of the <HI>Church of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>Further, it appears that conver&s;ion may be known, becau&s;e we are directed to <HI>examine our &s;elves</HI> in order to it; 2 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Examine your &s;elve: whether you be in the faith, prove

your own &s;elves; know you not that Je&s;us Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates.</HI> 2 Pet. 1.10. <HI>Give diligence to make your calling and election &s;ure.</HI> And to what purpo&s;e &s;hould we be advi&s;ed to do a thing that is not do|able? God don't advi&s;e us to impo&s;&s;ibilities. All the commands of God are po&s;&s;ible to be fulfilled; if not perfectly, yet they may be ful|filled: Phil. 4.13. <HI>I can do all things through Chri&s;t, who &s;trengthneth me.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall only add that con&s;ideration, that God makes many comfortable <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> to them that have grace; <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.7. 1 <HI>Jam.</HI> 12. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 3.10. But if men could not know that they have grace, that would fru&s;trate the de|&s;ign of the&s;e promi&s;es; that would take away the foundation of their comfort; they would be uncapable of making application of the promi&s;es to them&s;elves. How much happi|ne&s;s &s;oever is made over to them in tho&s;e promi&s;es; yet if they could not know their own grace, they mu&s;t be &s;trangers to their own happine&s;s, and not rejoyce in the good that is made over to them.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> How may a godly man know that he has Grace?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. He cannot know it in a way of <HI>Ar|guing.</HI> We come to the knowledge of many things in a way of rea&s;oning; arguing from things known, to things that are not known.
<PB N="81" REF="002072_0082_0FBB7B3B5FC56C40">
Thus a man may know his ju&s;tification: He may argue thus, He that hath faith in Chri&s;t is ju&s;tified; or he that has love to God is ju&s;tified; or he that loves the brethren is pa&s;&s;ed from death to life: Becau&s;e there is a certain connection between the&s;e graces and a &s;tate of ju&s;tification. Thus a man may know by rea&s;oning, that he has this and that parti|cular grace: He may argue &s;o, If I have the grace of faith, I have the grace of love, or hu|mility; becau&s;e there is a concatenation of graces, and they are in&s;eparable one from a|nother: But they don't know that they are gracious in this manner; the knowledge of their graces don't come in at that door.</P>
<P N="1">1. He cannot prove it from any &s;uch acts as may proceed from other principles. A mo|ral and religious conver&s;ation may proceed from other principles: Such a conver&s;ation is an argument to other men to be charitable, but it is no demon&s;tration. The young man in the go&s;pel walked exactly; Mat. 19.20. <HI>All the&s;e things have I done from my youth.

Zeal for God don't prove it: There may be zeal where there is no love: The <HI>Jews</HI> were great enemies to Chri&s;t, yet very zealous; Rom. 10.2. <HI>I bear them record, that they have a zeal for God. Paul</HI> had great zeal before he had any grace.

<P N="2">2. He cannot prove it from any &s;uch acts of Providence as are common to carnal men. Some men have &s;miling providences and great deliverances. God is very bountiful; and many argue from thence that they are godly; but they don't argue &s;trongly: God may

Grace, he might know it by believing the word of God. But it is not in this way that godly men do know that they have grace: It is not revealed in the word; and the Spi|rit of God doth not te&s;tifie it to particular per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Some think the Spirit doth te&s;tify it to &s;ome; and they ground it on Rom. 8.16. <HI>The Spirit it &s;elf beareth witne&s;s with our &s;pirit, that we are the children of God.</HI> They think the &s;pirit reveals it by giving an inward te&s;timony to it. And &s;ome godly men think they have had experience of it; but they may ea&s;ily mi&s;take. When the &s;pirit of God doth eminently &s;tir up a &s;pirit of faith, and &s;heds abroad the love of God in the heart, it is ea&s;y to mi&s;take it for a te&s;timony. And that is not the meaning of <HI>Paul</HI>'s words. The <HI>Spirit</HI> reveals things to us, by opening our eyes to &s;ee what is revealed in the word: But the &s;pirit doth not reveal new truths not revealed in the word. The Spirit di&s;covers the grace of God in Chri&s;t, and thereby draws forth &s;pecial actings of faith and love, which are evidential; but it doth not work in way of te&s;timony. If God do but help us to re|ceive the revelations in the word, we &s;hall have comfort enough without new revela|tions.</P>
<P><HI>Paul</HI>'s meaning is, that the miraculous works of the Spirit are a witne&s;s to the Chri&s;tian Religion. The thing that is witne&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="85" REF="002072_0086_0FBB7B464D8DB618">
to is, that <HI>&s;incere Chri&s;tians are the children of God;</HI> that the Chri&s;tian religion is the true religion; and that all that embrace it indeed are the heirs of eternal life: And the Per&s;on that witne&s;&s;eth is the <HI>Holy Ghost;</HI> he te&s;tifies to it by <HI>Miracles</HI> and <HI>extraordina|ry Gifts.</HI> The mighty works of the Spirit of God in the primitive times, were evidences of the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion; they were wrought for that very end. Heb. 2.4. <HI>God al&s;o bearing them witne&s;s with &s;igns and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> 1 The&s;. 1.5. <HI>Our go&s;pel came unto you, not in word only, but al&s;o in pow|er, and in much a&s;&s;urance, and in the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It is <HI>by Intuition or &s;eeing of grace in their own hearts.</HI> It is by con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; as <HI>Peter</HI> knew his love to Chri&s;t, when he &s;ays, <HI>Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee,</HI> Joh. 11.17. And as <HI>David</HI> knew his love to God; P&s;al. 116.1. <HI>I love the Lord,</HI> And as <HI>Job</HI> knew his repentance; Job. 42.6. <HI>I abhor my &s;elf in dust and a&s;hes.</HI> And as <HI>Paul</HI> knew that he <HI>knew Chri&s;t;</HI> 1 Tim. 1.12. <HI>I know whom I have believed.</HI> There is a reflecting power in man: As he can look out and &s;ee external objects, &s;o he can <HI>look in,</HI> and &s;ee his <HI>own actions.</HI> In this manner &s;aints know the <HI>corrupt workings</HI> of their own hearts: They know their pride, and worldline&s;s, and

frowardne&s;s, and unbelief; &s;o they know their grace. In this manner they know their natural actions; they know that they think, and what they think about; they know the acts of their Wills, what they chu&s;e, and what they refu&s;e; and the acts of their Affections; they know that they love their children; that they de&s;ire meat and drink; that they are afraid of pain and death; that they rejoyce in their good things: So, they may have the knowledge by intuition, that they know God and Chri&s;t; that they re|ceive the go&s;pel; that they love God and the &s;aints; that they are &s;orry for their &s;ins. A godly man under&s;tanding what it is to love God and to repent, tho' he cannot give an exact definition of them, yet may be able by his ob&s;ervation to know that he doth &s;o; and may be as able to &s;ay, that he loves God, and believes in Chri&s;t, as to &s;ay, he has pride and worldline&s;s in his own heart. There may indeed be &s;omething of more diffi|culty in it, becau&s;e many actings of grace are low and weak; on that account it may be hard to &s;ee it; as it is hard to &s;ee the motion of water in a river, when it moves very &s;lowly; and upon that account, becau&s;e <HI>grace is much counterfeited;</HI> and there be many actings that do look like the actings of grace that are not &s;o: But &s;ometimes grace works &s;o powerfully, that it is <HI>very vi|&s;ible;</HI> and men are able to di&s;tingui&s;h between

grace and the re&s;emblances of it, and be &s;atis|fyed under&s;tandingly: 1 Chron. 29.17. <HI>As for me, in the uprightne&s;s of my heart, I willingly offered all the&s;e things.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, it may be of great u&s;e for <HI>Ministers</HI> frequently to be giving <HI>&s;igns of Grace.</HI> The&s;e &s;igns are of great u&s;e for the di&s;covery of hypocri&s;y. The want of particular graces is a means to di&s;cover &s;ome. Some may be undeceived by con&s;idering, that they have not had an antecedent work of <HI>Humiliation.</HI> The account of the way where|in God works grace, <HI>&s;c.</HI> by the <HI>di&s;coveries of Go&s;pel Grace,</HI> may convince others. The want of <HI>Obedience</HI> may convince others. So, the allowing of pride or worldline&s;s, and the want of doing duties out of regard to God's glory.</P>
<P>But <HI>Signs</HI> al&s;o are of great u&s;e for the in|couragement and &s;trengthening of the &s;aints. Sometimes the di&s;cour&s;ing of &s;uch things doth draw forth the exerci&s;e of grace; and men find in them&s;elves that which they are hearing of. So it was with <HI>Peter:</HI> The very que&s;tion whether he loved Chri&s;t kindled a &s;pirit of love to him, that he was a&s;&s;ured <HI>that he loved him,</HI> Joh. 21.17 Sometimes the explication of the &s;ign, helps men to &s;ee it more clearly. They were at a lo&s;s; but when it is clearly laid open, it helps them to &s;ee it. Be&s;ides, it brings to remembrance what they formerly felt; and &s;o it brings joy, and
<PB N="88" REF="002072_0089_0FBB7B4DC1AB98D8">
renews their comfort. Moreover, it helps them again&s;t many temptations: They are un|der fears becau&s;e of the Providence of God, and becau&s;e of corrupt workings of heart; but when they hear that complacency in God, and the &s;ight of the glory of Chri&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are &s;igns of a good e&s;tate, that &s;atisfys them, and is a relief to them under their tempta|tions.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> The Grace given in Conver&s;ion is im|perfect.</HEAD>
<P>THe grace given in conver&s;ion, like other qualities, doth admit of innumerable <HI>degrees;</HI> and is very imperfect in the be&s;t of the people of God. Godly men are far from pretending to perfection: Job. 9.20. <HI>If I &s;ay I am perfect, it &s;hall al&s;o prove me perver&s;e.</HI> Hence we find lamentations of &s;ome of the choice&s;t men that have been in the world: Prov. 30. <HI>Surely I am more bruti&s;h than any man, and have not the under&s;tanding of a man.</HI> Rom. 7.23, 24. <HI>I &s;ee another law in my mem|bers, bringing me into captivity. O wretched man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death?</HI> The &s;orrowful <HI>falls</HI> of <HI>David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Jonah, Peter,</HI> are &s;ufficient demon&s;trations of this; and that
<PB N="89" REF="002072_0090_0FBB7B51AC6E6B90">
<HI>warfare</HI> that every godly man doth experi|ence: Gal. 5.17. <HI>The fle&s;h lu&s;teth again&s;t the &s;pirit, and the &s;pirit again&s;t the fle&s;h; and the&s;e are contrary the one to the other: So that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</HI> E&s;pecial|ly, grace at fir&s;t conver&s;ion is very &s;mall; if after twenty or thirty years growth, it is very defective, it mu&s;t needs be very &s;mall at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>There may be many rea&s;ons why God &s;uffers much &s;in to remain in his people, while they remain in this world.</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>the work of &s;anctification may be &s;o carried on, that they may be in continual need of Justification and Pardon.</HI> The pardoning of the &s;ins that men committed in their uncon|verted &s;tate, is a great manife&s;tation of the riches of his grace, and the virtue of the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but God doth day by day pardon the repeated iniquities of his peo|ple; forgives men thou&s;ands of times, tho' they have abu&s;ed mercy, broken vows, fallen from re&s;olutions: This doth wonderfully commend the grace of God, and the &s;acrifice of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. If there were not experience of it, it would be difficult to conceive that God would be willing &s;o to do. The&s;e are mighty in&s;tances of the un&s;earchable depth of mercy that is in the heart of God; and lead men to &s;ay, as Mic. 2.18. <HI>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and pa&s;&s;eth by the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the remnant of
<PB N="90" REF="002072_0091_0FBB7B5310224790">
his heritage, and retaineth not his anger for ever, becau&s;e he delighteth in mercy.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Becau&s;e they live among carnal men,</HI> &s;cat|tered up and down among unconverted men; and if this their Grace were perfect, they would not be fit to live together; it would be known who were godly and who ungodly, which would fill <HI>Families, Towns</HI> and <HI>Coun|tries</HI> with <HI>Temptation:</HI> Godly Men would be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it to bear the carriages of the ungodly, and ungodly men would not know how to bear the carriages of the Godly; it would fill all &s;ocieties with di&s;quietment and trou|ble.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e <HI>this is &s;uitable to tho&s;e Admini|&s;trations that God has appointed in his Hou&s;e.</HI> It is meet that all &s;hould wor&s;hip God; and the <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> that God has appointed is &s;uited both for the conver&s;ion of &s;inners, and the building up of &s;aints; to promote their humi|liation and recovery from back&s;lidings and releif under temptations. If godly men were perfect, they and ungodly men would not be fit to joyn together in <HI>confe&s;&s;ion</HI> or <HI>petition.</HI> The <HI>Ordinances</HI> that God has appointed are not not fit to be attended by men that have at|tained to a <HI>perfection in Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Some &s;aints do attain to greater perfection in grace than others; this is not always in proportion to the time &s;ince their conver&s;ion, but according to the improvement of their time: It is &s;aid of the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians</HI> that their
<PB N="91" REF="002072_0092_0FBB7B54839D3B60">
<HI>faith grew exceedingly, and their Charity a|bounded.</HI> 2 The&s;. 1.3. Some have more grace at fir&s;t Conver&s;ion than others, and &s;ome may grow more in a <HI>Year</HI> than others in <HI>Seven,</HI> and though it would be a pre&s;umptu|ous thing to determine the degree of Grace any have attained to in this life, yet it &s;eems probable that Saints do not ordinarily, if ever attain to &s;uch mea&s;ures of grace, but that they have more corruption than grace.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be but a little grace compared with corruption that God's choice &s;ervants do attain unto. It is &s;aid of the <HI>angel of Philadelphia, Thou ha&s;t a little &s;trength, and ha&s;t kept my word and ha&s;t not denyed my name.</HI> Rev. 3.8. And the Experience of the people of God &s;eems to confirm this: <HI>Sin doth ea&s;ily be&s;et them;</HI> Heb. 12.1. Corruption is like a fountain that is continually &s;ending forth its waters. Temptations do quickly infect. Pride and worldline&s;s and di&s;content and un|belief are very ready to work; and there is a great backwardne&s;s to &s;piritual duties, to faith and love, and to &s;ubmit to the &s;ove|reignty of God. Men's enjoyments are &s;o dear to them, that they have great difficulty to re|&s;ign them up to the plea&s;ure of God. There is much <HI>formality</HI> that doth attend duties of religion; and there is much &s;piritual blind|ne&s;s, ignorance of God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Neither doth it make again&s;t this a&s;&s;ertion, that &s;ome of the people of God have <HI>a very
<PB N="92" REF="002072_0093_0FBB7B59273673C0">
exemplary Conver&s;ation;</HI> for there are many <HI>other principles</HI> that joyn in with grace to effect this; natural con&s;cience, regard to reputati|on, a good temper, principles of morality, hope of reward and fear of puni&s;hment. If an exemplary conver&s;ation were an argument that men had more grace than corruption, how comes it about that &s;ome men that have not one &s;park of Grace do carry exemplarily? A good conver&s;ation is &s;ometimes only the effect of nature improved.</P>

God diligently, reforming mens lives, &s;earch|ing into the way of Salvation, has a great tendency to promote Salvation; for it takes them off from their &s;inful practices, and worldly de&s;igns that hindred them from get|ting into the way of life. They are &s;earching into tho&s;e things that will conduce to their conver&s;ion. Be&s;ides, when men are earne&s;tly &s;eeking after that, it is a &s;ign that the Spirit of God is at work with them: And the Spi|rit is promi&s;ed to make the means of Grace effectual. Joh. 16.7, 8. <HI>If I depart, I will &s;end the Comforter to you; and when he is come he will reprove the world of Sin, of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and of Judgment.</HI> And when he doth intend to convert, his way is, fir&s;t to convince of &s;in; and when he doth convince of &s;in, many times it is in order to conver&s;ion. And indeed many per&s;ons have had experience that in a way of labouring after conver&s;ion, God has &s;hewed mercy on them; while oth|ers that have been carele&s;s and &s;lighty, have continued in an unconverted condition. Ma|ny that have been &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate have obtained; and it is always &s;o, that where there is in any place, an earne&s;t de&s;ire to be &s;eeking after peace with God, ma|ny do obtain mercy; and if that &s;pirit &s;hould continue longer, many more might obtain, ac|cording to that, Mat. 11.12. <HI>The kingdom of heaven &s;uffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</HI></P>

deal of darkne&s;s in the minds of men about it. Many times godly men have &s;cruples, and &s;ometimes great fears, that they are not god|ly: They often &s;et in judgment on them&s;elves, and are at a lo&s;s what &s;entence to pronounce. And &s;ome ungodly men have great hopes that they are in a good e&s;tate, and &s;teal comfort that dont belong to them. Some can't &s;ee their way to condemn them&s;elves, and &s;ome give judgment for them&s;elves. But the Apo&s;tle doth here direct the one &s;ort and the other in the determination of their con|dition.

Secondly, he tells us how hypocrites may know their hypocri&s;y: He that loveth not, that liveth in the omi&s;&s;ion of love, that hath nothing of the working of that &s;pirit, that lives in the neglect of it, hath not the &s;piritual knowledge of God; whatever pre|tences he makes, this ca&s;ts the ca&s;e again&s;t him.

<P N="1">1. Many <HI>internal acts</HI> of &s;in, are no evidence of Hypocri&s;y. Every godly man has a cor|rupt principle remaining in him, and that principle don't lie &s;till; but is bu&s;y and active.

If they are alone, if they are in company, if they are in the works of their calling, if they are exer|ci&s;ing them&s;elves in the duties of religion, they are always haunted with a corrupt heart. They have a multiude of evil thoughts, de&s;ires, delights, fears, &s;orrows. Unbelief is often &s;tirring; &s;o pride and worldline&s;s, froward|ne&s;s and envy. There be many &s;tirrings of &s;in that they dont perceive; but abundance that falls under their ob&s;ervation. A corrupt principle will &s;tir upon all occa&s;ions; every thing that occurs will awaken it: Therefore &s;aints are warned to keep their hearts with all diligence. <HI>Prov.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 33.

<P N="2"><PB N="121" REF="002072_0122_0FBB7B9990EB4898">2. Many <HI>external acts of Sin</HI> are no evidence of Hypocri&s;y. Men have much more com|mand of their words and outward actions than of their thoughts, and the inward workings of their hearts: Yet godly men are often guil|ty of external &s;ins: They commit many &s;ins in words, Jam. 3.8. <HI>The tongue is an unruly evil.</HI> Many times their words &s;avour of va|nity, pride, unbelief, and uncontentedne&s;s. And they are often guilty of other external &s;ins, P&s;al. 19.12. <HI>Who can under&s;tand his er|rors?</HI> Every corruption is running them into tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; &s;ometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">omitting duty, &s;ometimes committing &s;in.

There be many proud, worldly, froward carriages that they are not aware of, and are ready to ju&s;tify&punc; And many &s;ins are committed thro' innad|vertency; they are hurried thro' fear, or pa&s;&s;ion, or pride, and con&s;ider nor at the time, but pre&s;ently after they &s;ee it, and are &s;orry for it.</P>
<P N="3">3. An <HI>act of gro&s;s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion</HI> is no evi|dence.

But as a man that has corruption in him may do choice acts of holine&s;s, &s;o a man that has grace in him may commit gro&s;s acts of &s;in. If a man's nature be much weakened, yet in a fit he may act very &s;trongly: So, if mens corruptions be much weakened, yet they may have fits wherein they may act very power|fully. It is an idle thing to think, that &s;uch things are impo&s;&s;ible as &s;everal times have come to pa&s;s. <HI>Noah</HI>'s intemperance, <HI>Lot</HI>'s in|ce&s;t, <HI>David</HI>'s adultery, <HI>Peter</HI>'s denying of Chri&s;t, are unan&s;werable arguments, that gro&s;s tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion is no evidence of an Hypocrite. It is no wonder if a gro&s;s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion &s;hould make a man &s;u&s;pect his godline&s;s, but it is no evi|dence. If God withdraw from a godly man, his grace will not prevent gro&s;s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Natural con&s;cience doth often pre&s;erve men, but grace doth not always pre&s;erve men from gro&s;s &s;in.</P>
<P N="2">II. A <HI>Cour&s;e of &s;in</HI> is an evidence of hypo|cri&s;y.

The other way of living in internal &s;in is, to live in the omi&s;&s;ion of &s;piritual duties: Whether a man knows it or knows it not, it is an evidence of hypocri&s;y.

There be great mix|tures of corruption with grace, there be many fal&s;e appearances of grace, which makes them afraid whether they did indeed exerci&s;e grace; and this makes it evident, that it is thus with Saints, that many of them are for a long time under doubt whether they be in|deed godly; thence we have the&s;e precepts, 2 Pet. 1.10. <HI>Give all diligence to make your calling and election &s;ure.</HI> 2 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Exa|mine your &s;elves, whether you be in the Faith.</HI> Some hypocrites are a great deal more confi|dent than many &s;aints.

When a man &s;ees that he loves God, and believes in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he will not be un&s;atisfyed about his godline&s;s. If he has been in the dark, and in great temptations ju&s;t before, yet this will beget a&s;&s;urance.</P>
