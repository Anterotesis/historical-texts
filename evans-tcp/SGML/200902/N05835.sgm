<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> Map, that the&s;e Sheets accompany, and that they are intended to explain and &s;upply, is pre&s;ented to the Public, when a longer Time was indeed nece&s;&s;ary to have given it the Degree of Correctne&s;s that was intended it. But the pre&s;ent Conjuncture of Af|fairs in America, and the generous A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the A&s;&s;embly of Pen&s;ilvania, have brought it to Light, when the Public will, it is hoped, receive Advantages from it, that will render an Apology for its premature Publication needle&s;s; and think it wortby the Encouragement of a <HI>BODY</HI> who devote the Public Money to the Public Service.</P>
<P>IT comprizes &s;uch an Extent, as is connected with that very valuable Country on the OHIO, which is now the Object of the Briti&s;h and French Policy, and the different Routes of both Nations thither. The Lake Ontario is equally open to both; to the one by the River St. Laurence; to the other by the Rivers Hud&s;on, Mohocks and Seneca. But the French hav|ing, thirty Years ago, fixed them&s;elves on the Streights of Niagara, by building Fortre&s;&s;es on Lands confe&s;&s;edly Briti&s;h, &s;ecured the Key on that Side to all the Country We&s;tward. Tho&s;e in Power &s;ee at la&s;t its Con&s;equence, and are projecting the Recovery of it; and with great Judgment, for that Purpo&s;e, are e&s;tabli&s;hing a naval Force on Lake Ontario, as very nece&s;|&s;ary in the Recovery and Securing of it. The I&s;&s;ue of this Enterprize will have great In|fluence on our Affairs, and of all Things it becomes the Colonies to pu&s;h it on with Vigour. If they &s;ucceed here, the Remainder of the Work will be ea&s;y; and Nothing &s;o, without it. The Engli&s;h have &s;everal Ways to Ohio; but far the be&s;t is by Potomack.</P>
<P>BY Rea&s;on of the little Acquaintance the Public has with the&s;e remoter Parts, where the Country is yet a Wilderne&s;s, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of knowing the Ways of Travelling there, e&s;pe|cially by Water: In the Map is pointed out the <HI>Nature of the</HI> &s;everal <HI>Streams;</HI> as where rapid, gentle or ob&s;tructed with Falls, and con&s;equently more or le&s;s fitted for Inland Navi|tion with Canoes, Boats or larger Ve&s;&s;els; and where the <HI>Portages</HI> are made at the Falls, or from one River, Creek or Lake to another. And for di&s;tingui&s;hing the Extent of the Marine <HI>Navigation,</HI> the Places, that the <HI>Tide</HI> reaches, in the &s;everal Rivers, are pointed out. And in the&s;e Sheets, both the Marine and Inland Navigation are treated of at Length.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="007411_0003_102BAF198F8C50F0">
AS the Natures of the Soil and Streams depend upon the <HI>Elevation and Depre&s;&s;ion of the Land;</HI> I have particularly explained here the different Stages that it is divided into. It were to be wi&s;ht, that we had like Accounts of all Countries; as &s;uch would di&s;cover to us great Regularity, where an unattentive Ob&s;erver would imagine there was Nothing but Confu&s;ion; and at the &s;ame Time explain the Climates, the Healthine&s;s, the Produce and Conveniencies for Habitations, Commerce and Military Expeditions, to a judicious Reader in a few Pages, better than Volumes of Remarks on Places, drawn without the&s;e Di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>TO render this Map u&s;eful in Commerce, and the A&s;certaining the Boundaries of Lands, the Time of <HI>High-Water,</HI> at the Full and Change of the Moon, and the <HI>Variation of the Magnetical Needle</HI> are laid down. But as the&s;e de&s;erve particular Explanations, I have, for want of Room, concluded to treat of them at large in a &s;eparate E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>ALONG the We&s;tern Margin of the Map is drawn a Line repre&s;enting the <HI>greate&s;t Lengths of Days and Nights</HI> (without Allowance for the Refraction) which will a&s;&s;i&s;t Tra|vellers, in forming &s;ome Judgment of the Latitude of Places, by the Help of their Watches only.</P>
<P>THOUGH many of the&s;e Articles are almo&s;t peculiar to the Author's Maps, they are of no le&s;s Importance than any Thing, that has yet had a Place among&s;t Geographers. But Want of Room in the Plate, has obliged me to leave out, what would have very much a&s;&s;i&s;ted my Explanation of the Face of the Country, I mean <HI>a Section of it in &s;everal Directions;</HI> &s;uch would have exhibited the Ri&s;ing and Falling of the Ground, and how elevated above the Surface of the Sea; what Parts are level, what rugged; where the Mountains ri&s;e, and how far they &s;pread. Nor is this all that a perpendicular Section might be made to repre|&s;ent; for, as on the upper Side, the Elevations, Depre&s;&s;ions, outer Appearances and Names of Places may be laid down; on the lower, the Nature of the Soil, Sub&s;trata and particu|lar Fo&s;&s;ils may be expre&s;t. It was with Regret I was obliged to omit it. But in &s;ome future Maps of &s;eparate Colonies, I hope to be furni&s;hed with more Room.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent, late, and antient <HI>Seats of the original Inhabitants</HI> are expre&s;&s;ed in the Map; and though it might be imagined that &s;everal Nations are omitted, which are mentioned by Authors, it may be remarked, that Authors, for Want of Knowledge in Indian Affairs, have taken every little Society for a &s;eparate Nation; whereas they are not truly more in Number than I have laid down. I have been &s;omething particular in the&s;e Sheets in repre&s;enting the Extent of the Country of the <HI>Confederates</HI> or <HI>Five Nations;</HI> becau&s;e, whatever is &s;uch, is expre&s;ly acceded to the Engli&s;h by Treaty with the French.</P>

<HEAD>AN ANALYSIS OF A GENERAL MAP of the MIDDLE BRITISH COLONIES, The Country of the <HI>Confederate Indians,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>As different Parts of this Map are done with very different Propor|tion of Exactne&s;s, Ju&s;tice to the Public, requires my di&s;tingui&s;hing the Degree of Credit every Part de&s;erves; and to make &s;ome recompen&s;e for the Defects of tho&s;e Places, where no actual Surveys have been yet made, by giving &s;uch a De&s;cription as the Nature of the Sub|ject will admit; which may, at this Time, be of as much Con&s;equence as the nice&s;t Surveys de&s;titute of this Advantage.</P>
<P>THE Briti&s;h Settlements are done, for the greater Part, from actual Sur|veys.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Latitudes. Longitude of Bo&s;ton and Philadelphia agree.</NOTE> The Latitudes of many Places taken with good In&s;truments, and the Longitudes of Philadelphia and Bo&s;ton, ob&s;erved by different Per&s;ons, and well agreeing, give a Foundation for the Projection of the Map. And as Philadelphia is a fine City, &s;ituate near the Center of the Briti&s;h Dominions on this Continent, and whether inferior to others in Wealth, or Number of Hou&s;es, or not, it far excels in the Progre&s;s of Letters, mechanic Arts, and the public Spirit of its Inhabitants; Rea&s;ons &s;ufficient for paying it the parti|cular Di&s;tinction of making it the fir&s;t Meridian of America.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadelphia made the fir&s;t Meridian.</NOTE> And a Meridian here I thought the more nece&s;&s;ary, that we may determine the Difference of the Longitude of Places by Men&s;uration; a Method far excelling the be&s;t a&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations; and as we may be led into &s;everal Errors by al|ways reckoning from remote Meridians. Tho&s;e who have only &s;een the Plans and Maps of this City, mu&s;t be cautioned not to give any of them Credit, for it extends only on the We&s;t Side of Delaware, about a Mile and a Half in Length, and about Half a Mile in the greate&s;t Breadth. Near the We&s;tern Extremity is the Statehou&s;e, the Spot propo&s;ed for my Meridian to be drawn through.</P>

THE Settlements made by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are bounded on one Side by the Ocean, and on the other by no certain Line or Di&s;tance; for in &s;ome Places they are not above 30 or 40 Miles from the Heads of Tide, and in others 150 or 200. In general, they may be con&s;idered as extended to No. 4

<P>THO' there have been many other Ob&s;ervations made in &s;everal Places, in the Settlements, I have always cho&s;en to adju&s;t their Situations by the actual Men&s;urations; becau&s;e many of the In&s;truments yet u&s;ed, are not &s;ufficiently accurate to determine the Latitude of Places with Nicety.</P>
<P>A MAP I publi&s;hed of <HI>PENSILVANIA, NEW-JERSEY, NEW-YORK,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's former Map.</NOTE> and <HI>DELAW ARE</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">So <HI>The three Lower Counties of New-Ca&s;tle, Kent, and Su&s;&s;ex, upon Delaware,</HI> were called, before they were annexed to Pen&s;ilvania, when this Name was given in Contradi&s;tinction to <HI>the three upper</HI> Counties of Che&s;ter, Philadelphia and Bucks. As it exceeds in Length and Barbarity all the &s;avage Names in my Title put together, I have re&s;tored the Colony its old Name of <HI>Delaware.</HI></NOTE>, in 1749, is reduced to a &s;maller Scale in this, and forms tho&s;e four Colonies. The Errors are recti|fied,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Errors now rectified.</NOTE> the principal of which were, Albany placed too far North, Shamokin too far We&s;t, and all the Route thence to O&s;wego five Miles altogether too much North; be&s;ides &s;everal Imperfections, in Places where later Ob&s;erva|tions and Di&s;coveries have given us Knowledge of. In the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion of my former Map I committed &s;ome Mi&s;takes in the Names of Places, near
<PB N="4" REF="007411_0007_102BAF218E5AE958">the Entrance of Delaware Bay on the We&s;t Side
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="marg">H d</NOTE>,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Capes of De|laware.</NOTE> and in my Attempt to rectify them, in the &s;econd Edition, did but add to the Confu&s;ion. I have &s;ince had an Opportunity of making a thorough Enquiry into this Affair, and conclude, that the Names that the Places thereabouts are now called by, and are the &s;ame as laid down in my General Map, are the only Names they ever had, and &s;till retain among&s;t tho&s;e acquainted with them; as Lewes, Whore|kill Road, Cape Hinlopen, Fal&s;e Cape, and Fenwick's I&s;land: Excepting, that Mr. WILLIAM PENN called Cape Hinlopen by the Name of Cape <HI>James;</HI> and Whorekill <HI>Lewes,</HI> on his fir&s;t Arrival in 1682; the former is &s;carce known at this Day, and the Name <HI>Lewes</HI> is confined to the Town, while the Creek &s;till retains the Name of the <HI>Whorekill.</HI></P>
<P>ALL mu&s;t admit that the pre&s;ent Names are rightly laid down; but what is related in regard to the antient Names mu&s;t be under&s;tood as only my Opi|nion. There are others, who think, on no le&s;s Opportunity of forming a Judgment, that Cape Hinlopen was formerly called Cape Cornelius; and that <HI>Fenwick's I&s;land</HI> was the <HI>Fal&s;e Cape,</HI> or <HI>Cape Hinlopen,</HI> of the Dutch, and others, till the Arrival of the Engli&s;h in tho&s;e Parts under Mr. PENN.</P>
<P>To complete what was left imperfect in my former Map, e&s;pecially in <HI>New-York,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. William Alexander's A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</NOTE>, I have been in a particular Manner a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mr. WILLIAM ALEXANDER, who&s;e numerous Ob&s;ervations and Collections add greatly to the Merit of this Part of the pre&s;ent One, as it will Authority with all who know him.</P>
<P>BESIDES a general Map of Connecticut, which the Rev. Mr. CLAP fa|voured me with,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Authorities for the Ea&s;t|ern Colonies.</NOTE> I have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted in drawing the <HI>EASTERN CO|LONIES</HI> by Memorials pre&s;erved in DOUGLAS'S Summary of the Co|lony Lines, as actually run round three Sides of <HI>CONNECTICUT</HI> and <HI>RHODE-ISLAND,</HI> and between <HI>NEW-HAMPSHIRE</HI> and <HI>MASSACHUSET;</HI> and the Exten&s;ion of the&s;e Lines in two Places to Hud&s;on's River. As for that, &s;aid to be run from Deerfield to this River, there is certainly a Mi&s;take of &s;everal Miles in the Length of it. The&s;e, with &s;everal Surveys by Me&s;&s;ieurs HELM, KELLOG, and CHANDLER, among&s;t which is an entire One of Connecticut River from No. 4

<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="marg">D b</NOTE>, given me by Mr. POWNALL, together with his own itinerary Ob&s;ervations on the Face of the Country, the Ranges and Bearings of the Hills, and Di&s;tances of Places, contribute to give the&s;e Parts a great Degree of Exactne&s;s. Nor am I obliged, in the&s;e Parts alone, to this Gen|tleman, but for the Corrections of many Articles, which had e&s;caped me in the former Map, and &s;ome other valuable Papers he procured me.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t Part of <HI>VIRGINIA</HI> is compo&s;ed with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Me&s;&s;ieurs FRY and JEFFERSON'S Map of it;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fry and Jef|fer&s;on's Map of Virginia.</NOTE> and as this had the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of actual Surveys of the Divi&s;ion Line with <HI>Carolina,</HI> and of the Rivers <HI>Ra|pahannock</HI> and <HI>Potomack,</HI> from their Entrances to their Heads, joined to the Experience of two &s;kilful Per&s;ons, it would have been Affectation to have
<PB N="5" REF="007411_0008_102BAF231158F2D0">omitted the Advantage of it. But however, an actual Survey from Phila|delphia to the Mountains, near the great Bent of Potomack, by the Pen&s;ilvania Surveyors in 1739, enabled me to give the ju&s;t Longitude of that Place from Philadelphia, which they mi&s;took by 10 or 12 Miles; and this obliges me to give Potomack, and the whole Country, a Po&s;ition &s;omething different. As that Performance is very valuable, I contrived mine to interfere as little as Po&s;&s;ible with it; and omitted the Counties and numerous Gentlemens Seats that it contains, to give Room for the Roads, In&s;pection-hou&s;es, Court-hou&s;es, and the Seats of &s;ome Half a Dozen Gentlemen, noted in the literary Way.</P>
<P>I AM obliged to the &s;ame Map,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mariland but imperfect.</NOTE> and Capt. HOXTON'S Chart of <HI>Che&s;opeak</HI> Bay, for <HI>MARILAND.</HI> But this Colony is the wor&s;t done of all the Settlements in mine, yet the Bay from Annapolis to the Head I have lately had an Opportunity of adju&s;ting; as well as to mea&s;ure the I&s;thmus acro&s;s from the Head of Elk to Delaware River, about three Miles below New|Ca&s;tle. There is a con&s;iderable Error in my General Map, which came Time enough to my Knowledge to be mentioned here, tho' not to be recti|fied; and that is, the Breadth of the Penin&s;ula from Fenwick's I&s;land to the South Side of Little Choptank, which I make 65 Miles, whereas Mr. PAR|SONS, one of the Surveyors, who ran the Line acro&s;s, informs me, that it &s;hould have been 70.</P>

The greater Part of Connecticut is of this &s;econd Stage, and is enriched by the fine interval Lands between the Chains, the greate&s;t being along the Con|necticut River, and near 20 Miles wide. 'Tis the Cour&s;es of the&s;e Chains of Mountains and Hills that give Direction to the &s;everal Creeks and Rivers.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gathered Land.</NOTE> To the Ea&s;tward of the fir&s;t Stage, &s;ome Land is made by an Accumulation of Sand from the Ocean, heaped together by the Meeting of the Recoil of the Flood Tide from the North Ea&s;tward with another from the South Ea&s;tward; and forms near all the Land of Cape Cod to the Ea&s;tward of the Bottom of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ets Bay.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape Cod.</NOTE> There are in this Series &s;ome few other Gatherings of Sand, but &s;carce worth the mentioning here.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Long-I&s;land.</NOTE> As for the outer Part of <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> it con|con&s;i&s;ts of both Sand from the Ocean and Soil wa&s;ht from the Continent, thrown into this Shape by the Direction given the Tides and Cunents by the adjacent Coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE Land,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The We&s;tern Series.</NOTE> South We&s;tward of Hud&s;on's River, is more regularly divided, and into a greater Number of Stages than the other. The fir&s;t Object worthy Regard, in this Part, is a Rief or Vein of Rocks, of the Talky or I&s;ingla&s;&s;y Kind, &s;ome two or throe, or Half a Dozen Miles broad; ri&s;ing generally &s;ome &s;mall Matter higher than the adjoining Land; and extending from New-York City South We&s;terly by the Lower Falls of Delaware, Schuylkill, Su&s;que|hanna, Gun-Powder, Patap&s;co, Potomack, Rapahannock, James River and Ronoak. This was the antient maritime Boundary of America, and forms a
<PB N="7" REF="007411_0010_102BAF284FBC2ED8">very regular Curve. The Land between this Rief and the Sea, and from the N&agrave;ve&s;ink Hills South We&s;tward as far as this Map extends, and probably to the Extremity of Georgia, may be denominated the <HI>Lower Plains,</HI> and con|&s;i&s;ts of Soil wa&s;ht down from above,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t Stage, or Lower Plains.</NOTE> and Sand accumulated from the Ocean. Where the&s;e Plains are not penetrated by Rivers, they are a white Sea-Sand, about twenty Feet deep, and perfectly barren, as no Mixture of Soil helps to enrich them. But the Borders of the Rivers, which de&s;cend from the Up|lands, are rendered fertile by the Soil wa&s;ht down with the Floods, and mixt with the Sand gathered from the Sea. The Sub&s;tratum of Sea Mud, Shells and other foreign Subjects, is a perfect Confirmation of this Suppo&s;ition. And hence it is, that for 40 or 50 Miles inland, and all the Way from the Nave|finks to Cape Florida, all is a perfect Barren, where the Wa&s;h from the Up|land has not enriched the Borders of the Rivers; or &s;ome Ponds and Defiles have not furni&s;hed proper Support for the Growth of White Cedars. There is commonly a Vein of Clay &s;eaward of the I&s;ingla&s;&s;y Rief, &s;ome three or four Miles wide; which is a coar&s;e Fullers Earth, and excellently fitted, with a proper Portion of Loam, to make Bricks of.</P>
<P>FROM this Rief of Rocks,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second Stage, or the Up|land.</NOTE> over which all the Rivers fall, to that Chain of broken Hills, called the South Mountain, there is the Di&s;tance of 50, 60 or 70 Miles of very uneven Ground, ri&s;ing &s;en&s;ibly as you advance further in|land; and may be denominated the <HI>Upland.</HI> This con&s;i&s;ts of Veins of dif|ferent Kinds of Soil and Sub&s;trata, &s;ome Scores of Miles in Length; and in &s;ome Places overlaid with little Ridges and Chains of Hills. The Declivity of the whole gives great Rapidity to the Streams; and our violent Gu&s;ts of Rain have wa&s;ht it all into Gullies, and carried down the Soil to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the Borders of the Rivers in the <HI>Lower Plains.</HI> The&s;e Inequalities render half the Country not ea&s;ily capable of Culture; and impoveri&s;hes it, where torne up with the Plough, by daily wa&s;hing away the richer Mould that co|vers the Surface.</P>
<P>THE <HI>South</HI> Mountain is not in Ridges like the <HI>Endle&s;s</HI> Mountains,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Third Stage, or Piemont.</NOTE> but in &s;mall, broken, &s;teep, &s;tony Hills; nor does it run with &s;o much Regularity. In &s;ome Places it gradually degenerates to Nothing, not to appear again for &s;ome Miles, and in others &s;preads &s;everal Miles in Breadth. Between the South Mountain and the hither Chain of the Endle&s;s Mountains, (often for Di&s;tinction called the North Mountain,
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="marg">H k</NOTE> and in &s;ome Places the Kittatinni,
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="marg">F f</NOTE> and Pequ&iacute;lin,
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">F e</NOTE>) there is a Valley of pretty even, good Land, &s;ome 8, 10 or 20 Miles wide, and is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Quantity of valuable Land that the Engli&s;h are po&s;&s;e&s;t of; and runs through New-Jer&s;ey, Pen&s;ilvania, Ma|riland and Virginia. It has yet obtained no general Name, but may properly enough be called <HI>Piemont,</HI> from its Situation. Be&s;ides Conveniencies always attending good Land, this Valley is every where enriched with Lime&s;tone.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Endle&s;s Mountains,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fourth Stage, or the Endle&s;s Mountains.</NOTE> &s;o called from a Tran&s;lation of the Indian Name, bearing that Signification, come next in Order. They are not confu&s;edly

Their Name is expre&s;&s;ive of their Extent, though no Doubt, not in a literal Sen&s;e. In &s;ome Places, as towards the Kaats Kill,

<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="marg">J k</NOTE> one would be induced to imagine he had found their End, but let him look a little on either Side, and he will find them again &s;pread in new Branches, of no le&s;s Extent than what fir&s;t pre&s;ented them&s;elves. The <HI>further</HI> Chain,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Allegeny Mountains.</NOTE> or Allegeny Ridge of Mountains,
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="marg">F h</NOTE> keeps mo&s;tly on a Pa|rallel with the <HI>I&s;ingla&s;&s;y</HI> Rief, and terminates in a rough &s;tony Piece of Ground at the Head of Ronoak and New River.
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="marg">D c</NOTE> The more Ea&s;terly Chains, as they run further Southward, trend al&s;o more and more We&s;terly; which is the Rea&s;on that the <HI>Upland</HI> and <HI>Piemont</HI> Valley are &s;o much wider in Virginia than farther Northward. This South We&s;terly trending of the Hither Chains brings them to meet the Allegeny Mountain, and in &s;everal Places to inter&s;ect it and form new Series of Mountains; as is the Ca&s;e, I believe, of the <HI>Oua|&s;ioto.</HI>
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="marg">J n</NOTE> Where the &s;everal Chains cro&s;s one another, or &s;ome &s;mall <HI>Spurs</HI>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Caution in laying out Roads a|mong&s;tMoun|tains.</NOTE> It may be ob&s;erved, that in laying out Roads among&s;t Mountains, 'tis be&s;t to chu&s;e the &s;tony, and not the rocky Ground; though from the Fewne&s;s of the apparent Rocks, the latter, to an unexperienced Per|&s;on, would be more promi&s;ing; becau&s;e, where a great Deal of loo&s;e Stones lie upon the Edges of Hills, and have not fallen from the impending Rocks, 'tis a &s;ure Sign, that, on the Removal of them, loo&s;e Earth lies underneath; for the Rains wa&s;hing away &s;uch, has been the Cau&s;e of leaving &s;o many Stones bare.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal Chains of the Endle&s;s Mountains which have not come to my Knowledge, and had they been &s;o, might have filled &s;everal Places which lie vacant in the Map. But &s;o far as we are acquainted with them, we ob&s;erve that each Chain con&s;i&s;ts of a particular Kind of Stone, and each dif|ferent from the re&s;t; and the&s;e Differences continue for their whole Extent, as far as I can learn. When I croft them I was not apprehen&s;ive of this, and omitted enumerating their Species. Some of the Chains are &s;ingle narrow Ridges, as the Kittatinni; &s;ome &s;pread two or three Miles broad on the Top; &s;ome &s;teep on one Side and extending with a long Slope on the other; and the &s;teeper they are, the more rocky; but they are every where woody where there is Soil proper and &s;ufficient to &s;upport the Trees. Towards the further Ridges North Ea&s;tward the Mountains con&s;i&s;t of rich Land, and in &s;ome Places are but as large broad Banks, which take three or four Miles to cro&s;s. In the Way to Ohio by Franks Town, after you are pa&s;t the Allegeny Mountain, the Ground is rough in many Places, and continues &s;o to the River. Hereabouts the Lawrel Hill &s;prings from the Mountain, and continues, though not large, in a very regular Chain, I believe, to the
<PB N="9" REF="007411_0012_102B8749B845A3C0">Oua&s;ioto Mountain. For though the Allegeny Mountain is the mo&s;t We&s;terly, on the We&s;t Branch of Su&s;quehanna
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="marg">F h</NOTE>, it is far from being &s;o, back of Virginia.</P>
<P>EXCEPT the further Ridges, as ju&s;t now mentioned,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Land among&s;t the Moun|tains.</NOTE> there is but little good Land in the Mountains; to be &s;ure not one tenth Part is capable of Culture, and what &s;mall Matter there is, con&s;i&s;ts of extream rich Soil, in Lawns, on the River Edges, being &s;o much rich Mud &s;ub&s;ided there; and commonly ga|thered above Falls, formerly in drowned Land, and now drained, by the Ri|vers wearing Channels through the Rocks.</P>

<P>I MUST not omit giving one Caution to tho&s;e in Power,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Caution to &s;ecure the Country back of Carolina in Time.</NOTE> in this public Manner, for I find from Experience, that few are to be benefited by private Information. Hitherto we have apprehended no greater Scheme of the French than making a Chain of Communication between Canada and the Mouth of Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. As this was remote, we thought our&s;elves but little intere&s;ted in it. Now they attempt it nigher to us, by the Way of Ohio, where they have begun an E&s;tabli&s;hment; if this &s;ucceed, it is not Ohio only mu&s;t fall under their Dominion, but the Country thence Southward to the Bay of Mexico. For that Rea&s;on, it becomes the Engli&s;h immediately to e&s;tabli&s;h Forts on the Cherokee River, and other Pa&s;&s;es in the Way from Ohio to Moville, before the French attempt to &s;ettle there, or draw off the Cherokees, Chica&s;aws or Creeks from their Friend&s;hip to the Engli&s;h. And &s;uppo&s;ing the French &s;hould be beaten off from the Ohio, 'tis ten to one but they will turn their Forces, in Hopes of better Fortune, to the Back of Caro|lina. We charge the Indians with Ficklene&s;s,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;takes in Indian Af|fairs.</NOTE> but with greater Propriety we &s;hould charge our&s;elves with great Want of Sen&s;e or Experience, in &s;uppo&s;ing any Nation is to be tied to another, by any Thing than Intere&s;t. The We|linis cultivated a Friend&s;hip with the Engli&s;h for the Sake of Trade, and got Leave of the Confederates to remove nigher them. They &s;hewed both Af|fection and Re&s;olution in the Defence of the Engli&s;h at the Taw&igrave;ghtawi Town

'Tis a Cu&s;tom, e&s;tabli&s;hed with the Engli&s;h, to purcha&s;e the Friend&s;hip of wa|vering Nations at a great Expence, and to abandon their Friends. Hence tho&s;e who know this Mixture of Weakne&s;s and Ba&s;ene&s;s that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es us, keep Members of Council in the French Intere&s;t as well as ours, as the Confede|rates do, to keep us under a perpetual Contribution; while tho&s;e Nations who are truly in our Intere&s;t are entirely &s;lighted.</P>
<P>IF we &s;ecure the Country back of Carolina in Time, we &s;hall yet defeat the very Point that it is the French Intere&s;t to pur&s;ue, I mean a Communi|tion between the Ohio and Moville.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">'The bad Na|vigation of Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi.</NOTE> and no other would &s;uit the French, we &s;hall find our&s;elves extremely mi&s;taken. Even now the French &s;carce ever come up that River by Water, by Rea&s;on of its great and uniform Rapidity, &s;carce to be &s;temm'd in a Canoe and &s;ix Oars in Mid-channel. This obliges the French, in coming up, to take to the River Rouge, notwith&s;tanding they are obliged to make one or two very long Portages. The Edges are le&s;s rapid in the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, but them the Enmity of the Indians on its Banks prevents their keeping &s;o near the Shore. Therefore, to make what U&s;e this River is capable of, the French mu&s;t &s;ecure the Country of the Chica&s;aws and Cherokees; and then Moville, and not New Orleans, will be the Center of the French Trade of Florida; &s;ince the latter, though &s;carce forty Leagues up the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, by Rea&s;on of the Rapidity of the River, is not reached with Ships in le&s;s than thirty or forty Days from the Mouth; and Moville is upon Tide Water. If, in Pur&s;uit of our pre&s;ent Point on Ohio, we &s;hew any Remi&s;ne&s;s in our At|tachment to the Safety of tho&s;e Indians, who are our Friends, or we neglect to &s;ecure the Country back of Carolina, the Defection of the Indians there is inevitable; &s;ince the French have long known the Con&s;equence of it, though much to their Co&s;t.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three great Falls.</NOTE> it is S. 60 W. four or five Miles, the Channel pretty &s;trait.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The North|ern Branch forks again.</NOTE> divides again into two Branches, at about a Mile and a Quarter above the Mouth, where each is about large enough to turn an under-&s;hot Gri&s;t Mill. Three Quarters of a Mile higher is a great Pine Swamp, through which both Branches come. Mr. SCULL thinks that the&s;e Branches, who&s;e general Cour&s;e is about N.

If it floods early, it &s;carce retires within its Banks in a Month, or is fordable in a Month or two more. The Land is &s;o level, that in the Fre&s;hes of Ohio the Back-water runs eight Miles up.

The Stream is very gentle, and pa&s;&s;able with large Battoes a great Way up, and with Canoes near 200 Miles to a Portage near the Head, where you carry over good Ground four Miles to Sandu&s;ki. <HI>Sandu&s;ki</HI>

<P>LITTLE MINEAMI River

<P>WERE there nothing at Stake between the Crowns of Britain and France, but the Lands on that Part of Ohio included in this Map, we may reckon it as great a Prize, as has ever yet been contended for, between two Nations; but if we further ob&s;erve, that this is &s;carce a Quarter of the valuable Land, that is contained in one continued Extent, and the Influence that a State, ve&s;ted with all the Wealth and Power that will naturally ari&s;e from the Cul|ture of &s;o great an Extent of good Land, in a happy Climate, it will make &s;o great an Addition to that Nation which wins it, where there is no third State to hold the Ballance of Power, that the Lo&s;er mu&s;t inevitably &s;ink un|der his Rival. It is not as two Nations at War, contending the one for the other's Habitations; where the Conquered, on Submi&s;&s;ion, would be admit|ted to partake of the Privileges of the Conquerors; but for a va&s;t Country, exceeding in Extent and good Land all the European Dominions of Britain, France and Spain, almo&s;t de&s;titute of Inhabitants, and will as fa&s;t as the Eu|ropeans &s;ettle become more to of its former Inhabitants. It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive, that had his Maje&s;ty been made acquainted with its Value, the large Strides the French have been making, for &s;everal Years pa&s;t, in their Incroach|ments on his Dominions; and the Mea&s;ures &s;till taken to keep the Colonies di&s;united, and of impeding the generous Attempts of his mo&s;t zealous Sub|jects; his Maje&s;ty would have &s;acrificed, to the Spleen of a few bitter Spirits, the be&s;t Gem in his Crown. It is not yet too late to retrieve the whole, <HI>pro|vided</HI> the Briti&s;h Plantations are not thought to be grown already too large&mdash; if &s;uch an Opinion prevails, an Opportunity now offers of &s;oon making them le&s;s.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Planta|tions le&s;s con|&s;iderable than commonly &s;uppo&s;ed.</NOTE> We may reckon the Repre&s;entation of the Extent and Power of the Plantations being great, and that &s;uch Power may be dangerous to their Mo|ther Country, among&s;t the greate&s;t of vulgar Errors. Any Per&s;on, who knows the Nature of the Soil, and the Extent of our Settlements, will con|fe&s;s, that all the Land, worth the Culture, from New Hamp&s;hire to Caro|lina, and extended as far back as there are Planters &s;ettled within three or four Miles of one another, though including nine Colonies, is not equal in Quan|tity to Half the arable Land in England. All the Whites in the Remainder of the Briti&s;h Colonies on the Continent, &s;carce amount to 120000 Souls.

National Ties of Blood and Friend&s;hip; mutual Dependencies for Support and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in their civil and military Intere&s;ts, with England; each Colony having a particular Form of Government of its own, and the Jealou&s;y of either's having the Superiority over the re&s;t, are un&s;urmountable Ob&s;tacles to their ever uniting, to the Prejudice of England, upon any am|bitious Views of their own.

But while they are treated as Members of one Body, and allowed their natural Rights, it would be the Height of Madne&s;s for them to propo&s;e an Independency, were they ever &s;o &s;trong.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;trong Co|lony of the Enemy near, dangerous.</NOTE> a &s;trong Colony, of a natural Enemy to England, on their Borders, would be the only Article that would render any Attempt of Independency truly dangerous; and for that Rea&s;on it becomes tho&s;e who would regard the future Intere&s;t of Britain and its Colonies, to &s;uppre&s;s the Growth of the French Power, and not the Engli&s;h, in America.</P>
