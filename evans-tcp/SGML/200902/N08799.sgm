<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the writing the following di&s;cour&s;e and prayer, the publi&s;her has been greatly &s;olicited, by many of the auditors, for copies thereof.</P>
<P>Therefore, in pur&s;uance to the repeated reque&s;ts that has been made, the publi&s;her hath made u&s;e of the pre&s;s to convey the &s;ame to the publick, with hopes it may be u&s;eful to &s;ome, and that no di&s;advantage will en&s;ue to any individual.</P>
<P>The publi&s;hing of good books hath oftentimes been of great &s;ervice, nay, hath often been the means of kindling a holy fire in the hearts of the lukewarm.</P>
<P>It cannot be expected that the reading of the following di&s;cour&s;e will be attended with the &s;ame power, as at the time of delivery, except being touch'd by that power which cau&s;ed them to flow forth.</P>
<P><PB REF="011241_0003_0F8678E7F5B2C3E0">
It is not the province of the editor to &s;ay much, or to multiply words, but hopes the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e and prayer may be read with a &s;olid and &s;ober mind.</P>
<P>It is the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of every one, to be careful how they handle the golden ve&s;&s;els (holy words) of the Lord's hou&s;e, and &s;ee that they prophane not the temple of God with unhallowed tongues.</P>
<P>I therefore &s;hall leave the i&s;&s;ue to the all-wi&s;e di&s;po&s;er of all good things.</P>
<P>The publi&s;her having not &s;een the author of the follow|ing di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ince &s;he delivered it, the publick cannot expect to have her approbation for publi&s;hing the &s;ame; but he hath &s;hewn it to many that were pre&s;ent at the time of delivery, and they are unanimous in their opinion it is the &s;ub&s;tance of what they heard.</P>

<P><HI>What&s;oever he bids you do, that do.</HI></P>
<P>[The&s;e words being much in&s;i&s;ted on in the foregoing part of the di&s;cour&s;e, the editor hath thought proper to prefix the &s;ame.]</P>
<P>IF I mi&s;take not, our dear Lord and Saviour, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, both he and his di&s;ciples that were with him, were invited to a marriage that was to be in Cana of Galilee, which place he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to honour with his heavenly pre&s;ence; and even there manife&s;ted him&s;elf by his omnipotent and divine power, in a mo&s;t wonderful and miraculous manner.</P>
<P>Since my &s;itting down here among&s;t you in this meeting, the thoughts of it came into my mind, with|out the lea&s;t &s;tudy or premeditation. I could not be &s;ilent, thinking it to be my duty, in obedience to the
<PB REF="011241_0005_0F8678E9459FB280">
divine will; for I de&s;ired not the &s;ound of my voice to be heard, but would much rather hear than be heard; but apprehending it to be my duty, as that eminent apo&s;tle and &s;ervant of our Lord did, to whom a di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel was committed; who &s;aid, <HI>Woe be unto me if I preach not the go&s;pel!</HI> I heartily wi&s;h, and it is the earne&s;t de&s;ire of my mind, that tho&s;e that are now concerned, may be &s;olicitous; and O! that it may be the concern of every individual, that is here pre&s;ent, to invite this heavenly gue&s;t, that we all might be favoured with his heavenly pre&s;ence, and made to partake of his divine comforts. If we were thus &s;olicitous and engaged in our minds, we might have great rea&s;on to expect his gracious pre&s;ence to be with us, as he our dear Lord hath promi&s;ed, &s;aying, <HI>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there will I be, and ble&s;s them. Where&s;oever two or three are gathered together in my name</HI> (that is, my power) <HI>there will I be in the mid&s;t of them, and I will ble&s;s them.</HI> What wonderful conde&s;cen&s;ion is this to his chil|dren and people, to be &s;o highly favoured with his heavenly pre&s;ence!</P>
<P>In this he fulfils his promi&s;e which he hath made to his di&s;ciples, as he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in another place, &s;aying, <HI>I and my Father will come and &s;up with them, and we will make our abode with them.</HI> O! ble&s;&s;ed in|habitant
<PB REF="011241_0006_0F8678EA1D878E18">
and heavenly gue&s;t! O! that it may be the happy experience of the pre&s;ent parties here concerned, that they may be favoured with the heavenly manife&s;ta|tion of divine love, that they may witne&s;s his &s;tupen|dous power to vi&s;it, pre&s;erve, guide and direct them!</P>
<P>We find that at the marriage in Cana there was to be a watch. <HI>What&s;oever he bids you do, that do.</HI> Here they were to watch for the divine command. O! that we may all be a watching, and have our eye to him that is both willing and able to help, and is &s;trength in weak|ne&s;s, and riches in poverty; that we may adhere to his heavenly teaching, that is found of them that &s;eek him, as he him&s;elf hath graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed, who &s;aid, <HI>He that &s;eeketh me &s;hall find me, and he that cometh to me I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t off.</HI> Here our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;hew|eth his un&s;peakable love to the &s;ons and daughters of men, to be thus &s;o graciou&s;ly vi&s;ited by the Lord of life and glory! O! that thou, O Lord may be invited! and O! that it may be the &s;olicitation of every mind that is here met, and are anxious to hear what may be &s;poken; that, by and through thy inward appearance in their hearts, they may be brought to know and ex|perience thy divine will. This was the &s;hort prayer of my &s;pirit &s;ince my &s;itting down among you. I heartily wi&s;h it was the concern of every one that is here. If it was the concern of us all, we &s;hould have cau&s;e to
<PB REF="011241_0007_0F8678EB4C1093C8">
rejoice in our coming together; and it would do our &s;ouls good to be thus favoured by Divine Love, who is the Lord from Heaven, the Quickening Spirit, the God of Truth. O! may there be a true and zealous labouring and working to &s;eek to him. O! may we be favoured with his heavenly company, that we may come to know him to be with us, and in the mid&s;t of us; and have the happy experience to witne&s;s his power, and ta&s;te of his ble&s;&s;ing. By this experience we &s;hall come to know his heavenly power to pre&s;erve, and his divine in&s;truction to teach us, who &s;peaks as never man &s;poke, who is the Won|derful Coun&s;ellor, the Mighty God, and Prince of Peace, the Everla&s;ting Father, and of the increa&s;e of his go|vernment there &s;hall never be an end.</P>
<P>Now, what great advantage would this be to the chil|dren of men, to know and witne&s;s this great power to rule and reign in them, who&s;e right it is to rule and reign; and have the experience of his love and favour, who is the Mighty God, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; that He might take upon him the government and di|rect us in his ways.</P>
<P>As we come under his government, and are obedient to his divine and heavenly in&s;tructions, we &s;hall come to know his kingdom to be come, and his will to
<PB REF="011241_0008_0F8678EB8C178CF0">
be done in us as it is done in heaven; and have that ex|cellent prayer of our Lords an&s;wered; <HI>Thy Kingdom come; thy will be done on earth at it is done in heaven.</HI> O! what an excellent and heavenly experience it is to have the mind re&s;igned to the will of our heavenly fa|ther! to know the kingdom of God to be come in righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace, and joy in the Holy-Gho&s;t? O! the heavenly rectitude of mind the people of God enjoy! what &s;weet tranquility of mind do they po&s;&s;e&s;s, where the kingdom of God is come? where righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace is known? and where the Lord Je&s;us rules and reigns?</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved before, that at the marriage which the Lord honoured with his pre&s;ence, they had a watch. The &s;ervants that attended, they were to watch and o|bey the orders given them; which was, <HI>What&s;oever he bids you do, that do.</HI> And they waited for the divine command. Now, here was the advantage they had that were waiting upon our Lord: by their waiting and watching they came to know the Lord's will, and o|bey His orders.</P>
<P>We find that, at the marriage, there was a want of wine. What was the expre&s;&s;ion to the &s;ervants that attended? It was, <HI>What&s;oever he bids you do, that do.</HI> And we may remember they were ordered to put wa|ter
<PB REF="011241_0009_0F8678EC670935B8">
into the pots, which were not to be handed forth till he ordered: and they waited for the divine com|mand. Here, our Lord &s;hewed his miraculous power. Here it it was our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord made the water wine, and then ordered the &s;ervants that waited, to hand it forth Ob&s;erve. The water was fir&s;t made wine by a miraculous and divine power. It was then, and not before, the &s;ervants had to hand it to the company that was pre&s;ent. How gracious was our Lord, how great his power, in &s;hewing forth this miracle? I could hot but admire his great love and wonderful conde&s;cen|&s;ion to mankind!</P>
<P>Now, let us ob&s;erve the expre&s;&s;ion in the orders gi|ven, which was, <HI>What&s;oever he bids you do, that do.</HI> And he directed the water that had been made wine, to be handed to the governor of the fea&s;t, that he might ta&s;te it; and he ta&s;ted it, and tho&s;e that were at the mar|riage. What was then expre&s;&s;ed? It was, <HI>The la&s;t wine is the be&s;t.</HI> O Friends, I cannot but admire the great love and conde&s;cen&s;ion of our dear Lord, in be|&s;towing his gifts to his children and people; how he manife&s;ted his power among&s;t them; and how conde|&s;cending he is to tho&s;e that are anxious to know the wa|ter being made wine, that the &s;pirits of the contrite might be revived, and tho&s;e that are ready to faint might be refre&s;hed by the handing forth of divine love, which
<PB REF="011241_0010_0F8678ECF6733580">
is the w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> of his kingdom, prepared and given by him that is &s;trength in weakne&s;s and riches in poverty. Our own &s;trength, as men and creatures, is as water, be our Education ever &s;o high, and our wi&s;dom but foo|li&s;hne&s;s. It is like water and not wine, be it ever &s;o excellent, till taught of the Lord, by his in&s;peaking word. The Lord he prepares it. It is his power alone, which is the &s;ame that ever it was, that tho&s;e who are truly concerned, come to know and witne&s;s a true and peaceable tranquility of mind. O that his company may be rightly and truly &s;ought after, that all tho&s;e that are here pre&s;ent, may be &s;olicitous to hear his voice, that &s;peaketh as never man &s;poke; that every one may attend to his divine teaching and heavenly in&s;truction; that they may ta&s;te of the wine of his preparing, and when he orders his &s;ervants to hand it forth to the peo|ple, may they have it to &s;ay (from a true and real ex|perience, <HI>the la&s;t wine is the be&s;t.</HI> This has been the concern of my &s;pirit among you, that you may wit|ne&s;s his power to be with you, and in the mid&s;t of you. It is his power only can do it. It is his power alone that can effect it.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes thought the lord is wonderfully manife&s;ting his power, even to the working of miracles. It is he that is the cau&s;e of the water being made wine, not tho&s;e that hand it forth. If he doth not pre|pare
<PB REF="011241_0011_0F8678EDB47CFB30">
it, if he doth not make it, and if he doth not or|der it to be given, it is but water, and not wine, which cannot profit the people. It is not the quantity but the quality can &s;atisfy tho&s;e that are &s;eeking the Lord for divine help and &s;trength. This has been on my mind as I have been engaged among&s;t you; and I think it was in &s;ome degree as a miracle.</P>
<P>I do not want to monopolize other per&s;ons places, or to take up the room of any other here. I could be more willing to hear than to &s;peak; but, methinks, when I feel of the water being made wine, I dare not but hand forth a little of the divine ble&s;&s;ing, in order that the gue&s;ts which have been here invited, may partake of the heavenly wine. The Lord he prepares it him&s;elf. He is inviting his children to come and re|fre&s;h them&s;elves with the wine of his kingdom. O, if people did but &s;ee, if their minds were rightly con|cerned; and if there was but a true &s;eeking to him, there would be a ta&s;ting of the wine of his preparing.</P>
<P>O that the eve of the mind was but &s;ingle to him, and to his dear Son our Lord, in whom the Father is well plea&s;ed, who &s;aid <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed!</HI> It is my &s;incere de&s;ire that there may be a hearkening to him, and a hearing of his hea|venly voice, that you may come to be acquainted
<PB REF="011241_0012_0F8678EE73D0F038">
with him, and obey his voice, that is the true Mini&s;ter of the Sanctuary and Bi&s;hop of his Church and People, whom God the Father &s;ends, is the earned prayer of my &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Now, if the eye were &s;ingle to him, and our expec|tations from him, and not from the arm of fle&s;h; we &s;hould know the Lord Je&s;us, who is all-powerful to be our redeemer. I &s;ay, if there was but a hearing of the voice of him, whom the prophet prophe&s;ied of, &s;aying <HI>A prophet &s;hall the Lord your God rai&s;e up, like unto me. Him &s;hall you bear in all things; and be that doth not bear him, &s;hall be cut off from among his people.</HI> If we did but hear and obey God, we &s;hould come to know his power to be among&s;t us. O that there may be a tru&s;ting in the Lord, and a dependance on his Spirit and Power to teach and in&s;truct us, is the ear|ne&s;t concern of my mind. It is He that &s;peaketh truth and no lie, for he is a God of Truth.</P>
<P>As we come to be dive&s;ted of Self, as there is no leaning on our own under&s;tanding [<HI>Lean not to your own under&s;tanding, but tru&s;t in the Lord</HI> (&s;aid an eminent &s;ervant of God) <HI>tru&s;t in the Lord, and he will help thee</HI>] not to lean on words, nor to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and parts of the creature, be them ever &s;o high and ex|cellent; but in true humility of mind, with a perfect
<PB REF="011241_0013_0F8678EF4AB4DC28">
re&s;ignation to his will, to wait upon the Lord, for his divine appearance in your hearts; for it is they that &s;eek him &s;hall find him: the humble he will teach of his way, and the meek he will guide in judgment. It is them he will fill with his heavenly oil; and tho&s;e that thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s he will fill with his hea|venly wine.</P>
<P>But, O Friends! there mu&s;t be a watchfulne&s;s and care not to lean on our own under&s;tanding, or on our own cogitations, that is &s;o apt to fill the mind. If we come to experience this, O how &s;hould we be taught of the Lord! taught by him that is Truth and no lie, for he is the God of Truth.</P>
<P>It is the true and humble &s;eeking &s;oul &s;hall be ble&s;&s;|ed of the Lord, and tho&s;e that hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s; it is they, and they only, &s;hall obtain the promi&s;e, <HI>Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord;</HI> but the rich and the full, they &s;hall be &s;ent empty away. Tho&s;e that think great of their abilities, and they that are lifted up in their own imaginations, they are tho&s;e that &s;hall be &s;ent empty away. The ability is not in man, nor is the &s;trength in the creature, but it is in the God of Truth. Great is the God of Truth! The Lord from Heaven is above all Gods, and above all Beings, and Principalities, both in Heaven and Earth.
<PB REF="011241_0014_0F8678EFF1AF9EA8">
Ble&s;&s;ed be the God of Truth! It is He that teacheth his people truth, and brings them to be acquainted with him&s;elf. It is by the manife&s;tation of Chri&s;t Je&s;us the truth is come to be known, as he him&s;elf hath ex|pre&s;&s;ed, &s;aying, <HI>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. I am the way; nor is there any other way to come to the Father, for there is no other name given among&s;t men, but the name of Chri&s;t, whereby mankind can be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>It is Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which is Life and Truth, that would rai&s;e us from &s;in and death to a life of righteou&s;|ne&s;s. If there was but a &s;eeking to him, and a de|&s;ire to be taught by him, what advantage &s;hould we then receive? Our &s;orrow &s;hould then be turned into joy, and our weakne&s;s into &s;trength; we &s;hould then come to know the promi&s;e of the Lord to be riches in poverty, and &s;trength in all our weakne&s;s. All tho&s;e that do put their tru&s;t in him, and have an eye &s;ingle to him, that are &s;olicitous for his divine in&s;truction, and &s;eek him with all their whole heart, who &s;eeks the doctrine from his mouth, &s;hall be made to know him that is the God of Truth. If thine eye be &s;ingle to him, thy whole body &s;hall be full of light; that is, if thou art &s;ingly looking to God, and to his divine ap|pearance in thine own heart, thou &s;halt come to know him that is God, whom to know is life eternal, and be made acquainted with his truth; for what is to be
<PB REF="011241_0015_0F8678F2033F6BC0">
known of God, is made manife&s;t in man. (This is &s;cripture doctrine.) It is there he is manife&s;ting and re|vealing him&s;elf again&s;t &s;in and wickedne&s;s, and again&s;t every evil way.</P>
<P>He that maketh manife&s;t is light, and in him there is no darkne&s;s at all. If thine eye be &s;ingle; thy whole body &s;hall be full of light; thou &s;halt &s;ee what the Lord would have thee to do, and what to leave undone In him there is no confu&s;ion, but the confu&s;ion is in the creature, for want of &s;ingly looking to God; and this want is the cau&s;e of the want of a true devotion to and wor&s;hipping God aright, who is to be wor&s;hipped in &s;pirit and in truth; for &s;uch doth the father &s;eek to wor&s;hip him. There mu&s;t be no dependance on fle&s;h and blood; for fle&s;h and blood &s;hall never enter into heaven. The apo&s;tle Paul conferred not with fle&s;h and blood, but gave up freely to the heavenly vi&s;ion, to the in&s;truction of the Spirit of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, as him&s;elf hath &s;aid. <HI>I conferred not</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>with fle&s;h and blood but &s;traightway gave up to the heavenly vi&s;ion.</HI> He did not receive the go&s;pel from man, but from the Lord from Heaven. Ob&s;erve how bold he &s;peaks his own experience, <HI>I conferred not with fle&s;h and blood. I re|ceived it not from man, but by adhering to the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the heavenly in&s;tructor, who is the way, the truth, and the light, that enlighteneth every man that</HI>
<PB REF="011241_0016_0F8678F31DD7D0F8">
<HI>cometh into the world; who is the Lord from Heaven, and King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</HI></P>
<P>We find that it was given to the apo&s;tle, ju&s;t men|tioned, to preach Chri&s;t Je&s;us to the Jews as Well as the Gentiles; though to the Jews he was a &s;tumbling-block and to the Gentiles fooli&s;hne&s;s. It was by obe|dience and a re&s;ignation to the divine truth revealed in him, that he became an excellent in&s;trument, in the hand of God, to di&s;courage vice and immorality, and had to preach righteou&s;ne&s;s; for it is the Righteous, my Friends, that exalteth a nation, but Sin is a &s;hame to any people. This is in&s;truction to mankind. This is what the Apo&s;tle of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord had to di&s;tri|bute. It was the great Bu&s;ine&s;s his Ma&s;ter &s;ent him to do, to preach righteou&s;ne&s;s and di&s;courage immora|lity, that Sin might be put an end to, and Righteou&s;|ne&s;s (which exalteth a nation) be e&s;tabli&s;hed. This was the End for which Chri&s;t came into the world, and was prophe&s;ied of him; and that a long time before he came in that prepared body which he received of the Father; that he was to put an end to &s;in and fini&s;h tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and in the room thereof e&s;tabli&s;h everla&s;t|ing righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Now, if ever the work of righteou&s;ne&s;s is done, if ever it be rightly and truly performed, it mu&s;t be be|gun at home, in our own hearts; for (ob&s;erve) Chri&s;t
<PB REF="011241_0017_0F8678F3B267F9F8">
came to take away &s;in, and in the room thereof to e&s;|tabli&s;h everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s. We may al&s;o take notice of another expre&s;&s;ion of an eminent &s;ervant of Our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord, that <HI>God &s;o loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son</HI>&mdash;(what for?)&mdash;<HI>to take away &s;in, in order that he might redeem to him&s;elf a peculiar and holy people, zealous of Good Works.</HI> How can we but be concerned that the Glorious End for which Chri&s;t came, might be an&s;wered, that &s;in, which is &s;hame, might be put an end to, and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion fi|ni&s;hed, that righteou&s;ne&s;s which exalteth a nation be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>If we were truly &s;incere, if we were true mini&s;ters Je&s;us Chri&s;t, how anxious would we be, how zealous would we labour, that &s;in might be put an end to, all tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion fini&s;hed! There is no room left for &s;in nor place for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; but the Lord directs to righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord with comfort; for the Lord is of purer eye than to behold iniquity with approbation. There is no people that are &s;o beloved of the Lord, that he can ap|prove of &s;in in them. It is nor forms or modes of re|ligion, or a formal righteou&s;ne&s;s, nor the inventions men will do; but it is through obedience and &s;anctifi|cation we are made righteous; and by being wa&s;h with the water of regeneration we come to be clean&s;ed from &s;in and pollution.</P>

If we come to be the beloved of the Lord, it mu&s;t be by experiencing his love in us, and being obedient to his heavenly will. It is the obedient &s;oul &s;hall live. It is he that &s;hall eat the good of the land, and drink of the wine of his kingdom. All tho&s;e that do his will &s;hall know of his doctrine. It is they that &s;hall be taught of the Lord, as our dear Lord &s;aid, <HI>He that do|eth my will &s;hall know of my doctrine.</HI> O may there be a real concern in every heart, and an earne&s;t de&s;ire rai&s;ed in each of our minds, that &s;in may be put an end to, and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion fini&s;hed! If we were &s;olicitous enough for this, what a divine energy and &s;trength would be put into our minds, that everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s might be brought in, and the kingdom of Chri&s;t be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>If we were true Chri&s;tians, taught of the Lord, and &s;olicitous for his honour, we &s;hould be made to know more and more, and be made ready to open to him, and willing to take on us his heavenly yoke, that would yoke us to his cro&s;s, and draw our inclinations to him|&s;elf. <HI>It is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth,</HI> &s;aith the Scripture of Truth. Here is a beautiful com|pari&s;on. It is compared to a yoke of young oxen that are yoked together, and are taught to draw, which they cannot do till they obey the yoke. It is as we come under the divine yoke, and are yoked to his cro&s;s, and made to obey, we are taught to draw and become &s;er|viceable in the creation, and u&s;eful to one another; for

he is only fit to live, who is fit to die. For this very end have we a being in the world, that we might glo|rify God, who gives us life, breath and being. This has been the concern of my mind &s;ince I entered this city, in the love of my heavenly Father, to call unto the inhabitants thereof, that they might eat of the fruit of in&s;truction, which is the way to life, and become o|bedient to the voice of wi&s;dom, which is calling them in the &s;ecret of their hearts. The Lord, in his mercy is calling unto the &s;ons and daughters of men; he is calling them from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Sin and Satan to &s;erve the Living God. I cannot but admire his un&s;peakable love and wonderful mercy that he be&s;tows on his people! Methinks there is a door of mercy open, which none can &s;hut but he that has the key of David, who openeth and none can &s;hut and &s;hutteth and none can open. A door of mercy is open, and mercy is handing forth; and if there be not a complying, if there be not a coming up in obedience to righteou&s;ne&s;s, the door of mercy will be &s;hut. This is plainly &s;et forth in the parable of the virgins.</P>
<P>We may remember, that when the bridegroom came the fooli&s;h virgins had no oil in their lamps; and they &s;aid unto the wi&s;e, <HI>Give us of your oil.</HI> What was the an&s;wer of the wi&s;e? It was a very rea&s;onable one,&mdash;<HI>Not &s;o, le&s;t there be not enough for you and us. Go and buy for your&s;elves. And when they went to buy, the</HI>
<PB REF="011241_0020_0F8678F640D4FB70">
<HI>bridgroom came; and they that were ready went in with them, and the door was &s;hut;</HI> and an an&s;wer was made to the fooli&s;h virgins, when they wanted to enter, <HI>I know you not.</HI> A di&s;mal &s;entence it was, and will be pro|nounced to the wicked,&mdash;<HI>Depart from me. I know you not.</HI> I hope that this may never be the ca&s;e of any that is here. The fooli&s;h had a name to virgins as well as the wi&s;e; but that would not get them an entrance. Tho' they had a name to virgins, it did not prevent the an&s;wer, <HI>I know you not.</HI> Ob&s;erve. Here was both a name and profe&s;&s;ion to religion. Both had the name to virgins but the fooli&s;h wanted oil: they wanted righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. The time was elap&s;ed; the door of mercy was &s;hut; an an&s;wer was made; and a woeful &s;en|tence pronounced,&mdash;<HI>Depart from me. I know you not.</HI></P>
<P>You have heard of him that &s;peaketh as never man &s;poke; who &s;peaketh in the &s;ecret of your hearts. But though you have heard, you may be no better than he that built his hou&s;e upon the &s;and. When the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that hou&s;e, it fell, becau&s;e it was not built upon a rock. So will it be with tho&s;e that tru&s;t to a name of religion, and a for|mal righteou&s;ne&s;s, but neglect to come up in obedience to the word of grace in their hearts. I hope, and I earne&s;tly pray, that this may never happen to any that is in the hearing of my voice. The Lord, in his mercy ble&s;s you and keep you: may his infinite power pre&s;erve and protect you!</P>

But he that built his hou&s;e on the rock, when the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that hou&s;e, it fell not, becau&s;e it was built upon a rock; &s;o will be &s;tand who builds on the divine rock, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Son of God, and &s;ure Foundation, Again&s;t him the gates of Hell &s;hall never prevail. The floods may come, and the winds may blow, and waves of temptations may rai&s;e them&s;elves high, he &s;hall &s;tand in the Day of Trial, becau&s;e he is built on the Divine and Eternal Rock.</P>
<P>Therefore let none deceive them&s;|elves, for <HI>Such aa you &s;ow, &s;uch &s;hall you reap.</HI> If you &s;ow to the &s;pirit, you &s;hall of the &s;pirit reap life everla&s;ting; but if you &s;ow to the fle&s;h, a mi&s;erable crop &s;hall you reap. It is by experiencing the work of righteou&s;ne&s;s wrought in us we come to ta&s;te of the ble&s;&s;ing; and <HI>O that it may be the ca&s;e!</HI> is the earne&s;t prayer that accompanies my mind; and that you may know his gracious favour and mercy to be with you, and keep you! Suppo&s;e I &s;hould &s;ay it hath attended me here, for which my &s;oul doth ble&s;s the Lord, who hath come down to his peo|ple, and is making his power known in ble&s;&s;ing the provi&s;ion of Zion.

<HEAD>A PRAYER.</HEAD>
<P>BE plea&s;ed, O Lord! to prepare our hearts, and put into our minds, to commemo|rate thy goodne&s;s. We are made to ad|mire, in a &s;en&s;e of our own nothingne&s;s, and &s;ay <HI>O Lord! what is man that thou art mindful of him, or the &s;ons of men that thou thus vi&s;ite&s;t them?</HI> Thy children that love thee in their hearts, prevail, un|der the influence of thy heavenly power, and are made willing to follow thee, and feel after thee, thou Lord God that change&s;t not. Thou art a God, &s;low to anger, a God of wonderful love and un&s;peakable kindne&s;s, Thy Truth is gone forth, and we cannot forbear to be|&s;eech thee, in behalf of mankind, all the world over let their names or profe&s;&s;ion be what it may) that thou|&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands may be brought home to thy Son; and that thou would&s;t make thy&s;elf known, by manife&s;ting thy&s;elf to them. Be plea&s;ed to remem|ber, in mercy, tho&s;e that have much thought of thy name, and al&s;o tho&s;e that have not enquired after thee; that by and through the di&s;covery of thy light, O Lord God of Truth, they may come to &s;ee thy &s;acred truth, and be made to follow thee where&s;oever thou goe&s;t, that thy name, which is holy, may be glorified. Ho|ly Lord God, as we have known thy infinite mercy to be with us, O be thou plea&s;ed, once more, to reach unto the hearts of &s;uch as rebel again&s;t thee. It's

thy power alone can effect it. It is the &s;anctifying, by thy divine power, thy in&s;peaking word, that can reach every heart, that can turn them from the evil of their ways, to &s;erve and obey thee, the Living God, that they may know a &s;acrificing to thy dear Son, and to Thee, O Lord GOD. Be plea&s;ed to give them an humble repentance, that they may know thee, O Lord, to be a God of mercy. O Lord, remember the poor in heart, we humbly be&s;eech thee, even tho&s;e who&s;e knees are ready to &s;mite together, that have no might or &s;trength of their own, and who are ready to peri&s;h. All &s;uch as rebel again&s;t thee, turn thou, O God, their minds to thee. Thou, O God, art known in thy own temple the heart. It is there only that thou art to be felt and wor&s;hipped. Prepare many more, yea, many thou&s;ands, that they may ta&s;te of thy goodne&s;s, and hear the voice of the High Prie&s;t who &s;peaks as never man &s;poke. In a &s;en&s;e that thou art a God that change&s;t not, and that it is therefore the &s;ons of men are not con&s;umed: in a &s;en&s;e of thy good|ne&s;s and mercy, we humbly pre&s;ent our&s;elves before thee, and be&s;eech thee that many may come to know and prai&s;e thy great name, who alone is worthy to be prai&s;ed, adored, and magnified, with thy dear Son im|maculate, and Holy Spirit for ever more.
