<HEAD>A VINDICATION, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation, was to redeem Man from the deplorable Corruption which was the Con&s;equence of his Fall, and to re&s;tore him into the State of Purity and Peace, wherein he was created; by informing his Judgment, rectifying his Will, govern|ing his Pa&s;&s;ions, and making him a <HI>New-Creature:</HI> In Pur&s;uance of, and to compleat this De&s;ign, it plea&s;ed God, after the Sufferings, Death, Re&s;urrection, and A&s;cen&s;ion of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, to pour forth the Holy Spirit upon the primitive Apo&s;tles and Believers. This Spirit was to continue with all true Believers, thro' &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Generations, agreeable to many Prophecies, particularly that of the Evangelical Prophet, &s;peaking of the Coming of the Redeemer to <HI>Zion&mdash;As for me, this is my Covenant with them, &s;aith the Lord, My Spirit that is upon thee, and my Words, which I have put in thy Mouth, &s;hall not depart out of thy Mouth, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed's Seed, &s;aith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever, I&s;a.</HI> lix. 21. And our Saviour confirms this, <HI>Lo I am with you alway, even unto the End of the World, Mat.</HI> xxviii. 20.</P>
<P>So long as the primitive Believers were faithful to the Appearance of this divine Spirit, and obeyed the Teach|ings
<PB N="2" REF="006239_0005_10280000E58F2C60">and Directions thereof, Chri&s;tianity remained in Pu|rity; but when this was for&s;aken, the Apo&s;tacy began, which &s;oon &s;pread, and became general; then Form was &s;et up in&s;tead of Power, and Men being vain in their Imaginations, their fooli&s;h Hearts became darken'd, &s;o that they knew not the Nature nor De|&s;ign of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, but under a Pretence of being his Mini&s;ters, and of having the Right of ex|plaining his Laws, they got Power into their Hands, and enforced Obedience: Thus the Simplicity of the Go&s;pel being for&s;ook for worldly Pomp and Power, in&s;tead of the peaceable, loving, and for|giving Temper, which it enjoined, it was mi&s;con|&s;trued to allow of Violence and Oppre&s;&s;ion. In this Apo&s;tacy from the Life and Spirit of Chri&s;t, many Evils which the primitive Chri&s;tians were redeemed from, came to be reckoned nece&s;&s;ary and expedi|ent.</P>
<P>But when it plea&s;ed Almighty God to vi&s;it our primitive Friends and Elders, with the Di&s;covery of his divine Light and Truth in their Souls, he &s;hew|ed them, that notwith&s;tanding there had been among Prote&s;tants a great Reformation from the black and gro&s;s Corruptions of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> yet the Purity and Perfection of the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation, required a much further and more eminent Change: And in Obedience to this Light, they proclaimed Deliverance from all Sin, as a State attainable, thro' Faith in Chri&s;t, and true Obedience to his Spirit, <HI>A Mea&s;ure or Manife&s;tation whereof,</HI> was <HI>given to every Man,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 7. And that this Spirit was an infallible Teacher; that by it alone Men could come to a right Under&s;tanding of the Scriptures; that it led into all Truth, redeemed from all Un|righteou&s;ne&s;s, gave Victory over the fallen Pa&s;&s;ions, and renewed the Image of God in the Soul of Man. This was the primary and chief Article that they
<PB N="3" REF="006239_0006_10280003F6B0FA00">were fir&s;t convinced of them&s;elves, and found nece&s;|&s;ary to publi&s;h to others.</P>
<P>By this Spirit they were convinced of the Sinful|ne&s;s of many Things, which other Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity were in the Practice of, and thought allowable, <HI>viz.</HI> War, Per&s;ecution for different Sen|timents in Religion, a Man-made and Hireling Mi|ni&s;try, Swearing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e they thought incon|&s;i&s;tent with the Purity and Perfection of the Chri&s;ti|an Religion&mdash;And that War can be now proved to be &s;o, by fair and candid Interpretations of the Scriptures, will I hope appear in the following Ex|amination of a late Sermon on that Subject.</P>
<P>But to obviate Objections, let me here ob&s;erve, that our Friends have never (that I know of) con|demned &s;uch in the U&s;e of Carnal Weapons, who are not yet convinced that the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel forbids them: But they did, and now do call all Men to believe in the inward and &s;piritual Appearance of Chri&s;t in the Soul, who will teach all that &s;o believe, and hearken to him, to deny them|&s;elves, to for&s;ake a Dependance upon human Means, and tru&s;t in God alone; and they e&s;teem it their Duty to te&s;tify that &s;uch are not in Unity with them, who, making Profe&s;&s;ion of this inward Principle, manife&s;t a Conduct contrary to it.</P>
<P>The Sermon which I am about to con&s;ider, is upon <HI>Exodus</HI> xv. 3. <HI>The Lord is a Man of War</HI>&mdash; This was Part of a Song of Prai&s;es for a miraculous Deliverance, wrought by the immediate Hand of God, without any human Contrivance or Force&mdash; The Command to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by their Enemies, was, <HI>Fear ye not, &s;tand &s;till and &s;ee the Salvation of the Lord&mdash;The Lord &s;hall fight for you, and ye &s;hall hold your Peace.</HI></P>
<P>The Author of the Sermon endeavours, from his Text, and &s;ome other Appellations given to the Al|mighty
<PB N="4" REF="006239_0007_1028000582CA37D8">in the Old Te&s;tament, <HI>viz. The Lord of Ho&s;ts, The God of the Armies of I&s;rael,</HI> &amp;c. to prove that War was thence agreeable to him.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Lord doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men,</HI> Lam. iii. 33.</NOTE></P>
<P>Though &s;ome Wars under that Di&s;pen&s;ation were commanded of God, and therefore tho&s;e Appellati|ons were then &s;uitable and proper, yet I cannot per|ceive that they di&s;cover any Approbation of War be|gun and pur&s;ued at the meer Plea&s;ure and Will of Men&mdash;I rather take them to denote the Greatne&s;s of his Power and Superiority, and therefore the Ju&s;tne&s;s and Propriety of an entire Dependance upon him&mdash;They convey an Idea of Sufficiency to di&s;|appoint the Enterprizes of the mo&s;t numerous Ho&s;ts, or to ble&s;s with Succe&s;s the Endeavours of a few at his Command. The In&s;tances of his manife&s;ting this Almighty Power, in both the&s;e Re&s;pects, are fre|quent&mdash;The Ca&s;e of <HI>Gideon, Judges</HI> vii. when he prepared to go again&s;t the <HI>Midianites,</HI> is a very me|morable One: He had an Army of 32,000 Men, but the Lord &s;aid unto him, <HI>The People that are with thee, are too many for me, to give the Midia|nites into their Hand, le&s;t I&s;rael vaunt them&s;elves again&s;t me, &s;aying, Mine own Hand hath &s;aved me.</HI> Wherefore he at the Command of God, reduced his Army to 300&mdash;And the Lord directed him in what Manner to proceed, and as he obeyed, the mighty Ho&s;t of the <HI>Midianites</HI> was put to flight&mdash;Here (though the U&s;e of outward Means was permitted) a &s;trong and entire Dependance upon God was re|quired, even in that Day: Can &s;uch a Dependance be le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary in a Day of Go&s;pel Light?</P>
<P>Many Parts of the Old Te&s;tament have been con|&s;idered by religious Writers, as Types and Figures of future Times: Thus <HI>Solomon</HI> is in &s;ome In&s;tances a Type of Chri&s;t; and the Building of the outward
<PB N="5" REF="006239_0008_1028000860957DE0">Temple, a lively Figure of the Gathering of the Church in the latter Days&mdash;<HI>David</HI> had been a Man of War, at the Direction of God: He had it in his Heart to build an Hou&s;e to the Name of the Lord, but he was not permitted to execute that De&s;ign&mdash; The Reader is de&s;ired to remark the Rea&s;on in <HI>Da|vid</HI>'s Words, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxii. 7, 8, 9. <HI>And David &s;aid to Solomon, My Son, as for me, it was in my Mind to build an Hou&s;e unto the Name of the Lord my God; but the Word of the Lord came to me, &s;aying, Thou ha&s;t &s;hed Plood abundantly, and ha&s;t made great Wars: Thou &s;halt not build an Hou&s;e un|to my Name, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t &s;hed much Blood upon the Earth in my Sight; behold a Son &s;hall be born to thee, who &s;hall be a Man of Re&s;t, and I will give him Re&s;t from all his Enemies round about, for his Name &s;hall be Solomon, and I will give Peace and Quietne&s;s unto I&s;rael in his Days.</HI> If a Ce&s;&s;ation from War was nece&s;&s;ary for the Building that out|ward Temple, how much more &s;o is it, for the Ga|thering of all Nations to be Members of the Church of Chri&s;t? <HI>The Glory of this latter Hou&s;e &s;hall be greater than of the former, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts: And in this Place will I give Peace, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, Hag.</HI> ii. 9. Though the Almigh|ty is &s;tiled by <HI>Mo&s;es, A Man of War,</HI> he is called by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiii. 11. <HI>The God of Love and Peace.</HI> And the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> &s;aith, <HI>God is Love, and he that dwelleth in Love, dwell|eth in God, and God in him,</HI> 1 <HI>John,</HI> iv. 16.</P>
<P>The Sermon hath in <HI>Page</HI> 8, the following Para|graph, <Q>Surely if Protection from Injuries, Peace among Neighbours, and the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, be de&s;irable and valuable Benefits, which all Mankind mu&s;t with one Voice acknowledge, then of con&s;equence, that which at times is the only Mean left to procure them, mu&s;t be lawful, nece&s;&s;ary, and valuable al&s;o.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="006239_0009_1028000B582CFAE8">
The "Only Mean" here, is War, and whether the Expre&s;&s;ion &s;uits with the Belief of an Over-ruling, Omnipre&s;ent Providence, without who&s;e Permi&s;&s;ion no Evil can happen, and who alone hath the Con|troul of every Thing, I would have a little to be thought upon.&mdash;It will appear from the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, that there were Times when, to human Ap|pearance, there was no Way for tho&s;e valuable Bene|fits to be pre&s;erved but by War, and yet they were delivered without the U&s;e of this Mean.&mdash;The Ca&s;e of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> at the <HI>Red Sea</HI> when the <HI>Egyptians</HI> pur&s;ued them, <HI>Exodus</HI> xiv.&mdash;That of the coming up of <HI>Sennacherib,</HI> King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> again&s;t <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in the Time of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> 2 <HI>Kings,</HI> xviii. 19.&mdash;That of &s;everal Nations joining together again&s;t <HI>Judah</HI> in the Time of <HI>Jeho&s;aphat,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xx. are Proofs of this. And there are &s;everal In&s;tances, that when the Mean of War hath been u&s;ed, 'till there was no Appearance to the natural Eye of Pre&s;erva|tion, the Almighty hath provided a Deliverance without the Help of human Means. What an un|happy Circum&s;tance did he deliver <HI>Samaria</HI> from, when be&s;ieged by the <HI>Syrians,</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> vi. 7. when the Famine among the Be&s;ieged was &s;o great, that A&s;&s;es Heads, and Doves Dung, &s;old for a very great Price, and Women agreed to eat their own Children; in the mid&s;t of this &s;ore Di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;<HI>Eli|&s;ha &s;aid, Hear ye the Word of the Lord, Thus &s;aith the Lord, To-morrow about this Time, &s;hall a Mea&s;ure of Fine Flour be &s;old for a Shekel, and two Mea&s;ures of Barley for a Shekel, in the Gate of Samaria</HI>&mdash;This Prediction doubtle&s;s appeared, to natural Rea&s;on, very unlikely to come to pa&s;s &s;o &s;oon, and yet the Almighty cau&s;ed it to be fulfilled&mdash;And the Lord (upon who&s;e Hand the King leaned) who di&s;believed the Prophecy, lo&s;t his Life in &s;eeing it fulfilled, with|out being permitted to partake of the Plenty.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="006239_0010_1028000E2CCF6F80">
Could the Almighty deliver in that Day? Could he then pre&s;erve without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of human Strength and Abilities? And can he not equally do &s;o now? <HI>Behold the Lord's Hand is not &s;horten'd, that it cannot &s;ave: Neither his Ear heavy, that it cannot hear, I&s;aiah</HI> lxix. 1.</P>
<P>We are told in the Sermon, <HI>Page</HI> 8. That the Light of Nature, the Law of God, and the Go&s;|pel of Chri&s;t, con&s;pire to evince the Divine Appro|bation of Lawful War&mdash;Lawful War is before de|fined in the three following In&s;tances.</P>
<Q><P>1&s;t, When undertaken for nece&s;&s;ary Defence again&s;t unju&s;t Inva&s;ion of &s;uch as de&s;ign to do us Harm, either by a&s;&s;aulting our Per&s;ons, or rob|bing us of, and ruining our E&s;tates.</P>
<P>2dly, When commenced for the Recovery of &s;omething of great Importance unju&s;tly taken from us, which we cannot do well without, nor, after Application, obtain by milder Mea&s;ures; e&s;pecially when the Con&s;equences of the Lo&s;s are like to be more prejudicial and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, than the Con&s;equences of the War entered into to re|cover it: Thus <HI>David</HI> pur&s;ued the <HI>Amalekites,</HI> who carried his and his Peoples Wives away Cap|tives, together with their Sons and Daughters.</P>
<P>3dly, War is no doubt lawful, and con&s;equent|ly approved by God, when undertaken by the Magi&s;trate, for the Puni&s;hment of &s;ome great Injury or Wrong, which much affects the Credit and In|tere&s;t of a Nation or People, after all &s;ofter Means for Redre&s;s fail of Succe&s;s: Thus the Royal P&s;al|mi&s;t commenced War again&s;t the <HI>Ammonites</HI> for their contemptuous U&s;age of his Amba&s;&s;adors.</P></Q>
<P>In the&s;e three In&s;tances we are told po&s;itively War is lawful; but before we examine his Proofs of this, let it be ob&s;erved, that in the &s;econd Ca&s;e, where <HI>David</HI>'s pur&s;uing the <HI>Amalekites</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a
<PB N="8" REF="006239_0011_10280012345CC130">Parallel, though an extreamly afflicting one, when the <HI>Amalekites</HI> had, in the Ab&s;ence of <HI>David</HI> and his Men, &s;mitten <HI>Ziclag,</HI> and burnt it with Fire, and had taken Captives their Wives, and their Sons, and their Daughters, and to add to his Difficulty, the People were &s;o enraged that they &s;pake of Ston|ing him, yet <HI>David,</HI> before he pur&s;ued, <HI>Enquired at the Lord, &s;aving, Shall I pur&s;ue after this Troop? Shall I overtake them? And he an&s;wered him, Pur&s;ue; for thou &s;halt &s;urely overtake them, end without fail recover all:</HI> Upon which the learned <HI>Poole</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q><HI>Da|vid</HI> was &s;en&s;ible of his former Error in neglecting to a&s;k Coun&s;el of God, by the Ephod, when he came to <HI>Achi&s;h,</HI> and when he went out with <HI>Achi&s;h</HI> to the Battle, and his Nece&s;&s;ity now brings him to his Duty, and his Duty meets with Succe&s;s.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is very probable <HI>David</HI> likewi&s;e enquired before he went up again&s;t the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> as he had before &s;uffered for the Breach of this Duty.</NOTE></P>
<P>If then it had been an Error not to have enquired of God, in &s;o pinching a Ca&s;e as this, the Con&s;e|quence fairly deducible is, That &s;hould we be in the like Circum&s;tances, we mu&s;t make the like Enquiry, and receive the Divine Permi&s;&s;ion and Command, otherwi&s;e <HI>David</HI>'s Example will not be wholly fol|lowed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Proof propo&s;ed (in the Sermon) That War in the foregoing In&s;tances is lawful, is from the Light of Nature; and I &s;hould not have attacked the Arguments drawn from thence, had not this Writer a&s;ked, <Q>Who is the Author thereof but God him&s;elf?</Q> The following Di&s;tinction &s;eems therefore nece&s;&s;ary to be made.</P>
<P>God created Man good, upright and holy; and had he continued in this State, there never would have been any War, and con&s;equently no need of Self|defence; but Man falling, thro' Di&s;obedience, his
<PB N="9" REF="006239_0012_102800154904F5C0">Nature became corrupted, his Faculties depraved, and the whole intellectual Sy&s;tem di&s;ordered: Thus be|gan &s;hedding of Blood, and the Earth was early filled with Violence. This was the unhappy Con&s;equence of Sin&mdash;I hope this Writer will not venture to &s;ay, that God was the Author of Nature thus corrupted: The Nature, and the Light of Nature, that he was the Au|thor of, was holy, innocent, and perfect; but the Cor|ruption in Nature from whence proceeded Violence and Blood&s;hed, was occa&s;ioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan. Let any Man therefore retain this Di&s;tinc|tion, and he will not at all wonder, that <Q>the univer&s;al Practice of all Nations, as well of the mo&s;t civi|li&s;ed, as of the mo&s;t rude and barbarous, do all with one Con&s;ent oppo&s;e Force to Force</Q>&mdash;for it is not from the degenerate fallen Light of Nature that Arguments are to be drawn for the Formation and E&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tian Principles, neither are any from it, of any Weight in Oppo&s;ition thereto. It would be ea&s;y however to prove from the Writings of the <HI>Gentile</HI> Philo&s;ophers, that they were convinced Man had fallen from the Condition he was once in, that he had been mi&s;led and corrupted by &s;ome evil Principle, and that they could not conceive it po&s;|&s;ible that a holy, ju&s;t God, &s;hould make him &s;ubject to evil Pa&s;&s;ions, apt to commit Injuries, and fond of Revenge&mdash;Le&s;t any &s;hould imagine they all thought Force the be&s;t Way to repel Force, hear what <HI>Plato</HI> &s;ays <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the Name of <HI>Socrates.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gentleman's Magazine,</HI> 1737.

He who &s;uf|fers Evil, if in like Manner he returns Evil to him, who did it, is not Ju&s;t, as the Vulgar &s;ays, but Unju&s;t; for to bring Evil upon Men, differs nothing from doing them an Injury&mdash;It is not de|cent

<P>Of the Proofs, under this Head of the Light of Nature, I &s;hall take notice of two or three other Paragraphs.</P>
<P><Q>If it be not lawful (&s;aith the Sermon, <HI>Page</HI> 11) to oppo&s;e by Force unju&s;t Invaders, then the Goods of Providence are vouch&s;afed to us in vain; and Men of the &s;tricte&s;t Integrity, as well as Females of the mo&s;t unblemi&s;hed Virtue, will ever be expo&s;ed as an ea&s;y Prey to the vile&s;t In|&s;ults of the mo&s;t &s;candalous Scoundrels.</Q></P>

<P>Can any Man po&s;&s;ibly think that War is a Part of the moral Law, couched under this Precept, <HI>Thou &s;halt not kill;</HI> and does it follow that therefore War mu&s;t for ever be lawful&mdash;This Method of making Texts mean what they never meant, our Author had ta|ken in <HI>Page</HI> 9. with this Pa&s;&s;age in the <HI>Prov.</HI> xxii. 3. <HI>The prudent Man, fore&s;eeing evil, hides him&s;elf; " i. e.</HI> (&s;aith the Sermon) prepares for his Defence." &s;o that hiding ones &s;elf, and preparing for Defence, are &s;o exactly alike, that they are taken one for the other.</P>
<P><Q>Now (&s;aith the Sermon, <HI>P.</HI> 14) if the Almighty has approved of War formerly, and there is &s;till the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity of it under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen|&s;ation as before, it will follow, that it is equally lawful now: It is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that the ble&s;|&s;ed God, who is infinite in Wi&s;dom, and unaltera|ble in his Nature, would determine contrarily at different Periods of Time, concerning a Ca&s;e that is &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame.</Q></P>

<P>If it be a Doubt why the dark and di&s;tant Pro&s;|pects of the Go&s;pel, which the <HI>Jews</HI> had, did not di&s;cover to them in general, that the Time &s;hould
<PB N="22" REF="006239_0025_1028003A74BA4E68">come when outward War &s;hould be laid a&s;ide, the &s;ame Difficulty recurs with re&s;pect to Sacrifices, Burnt-offerings, Circumci&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and yet &s;ome of the in&s;pired Prophets fore&s;aw that Time. If it be objected, That Sacrifices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were Types and Fi|gures; &s;o, in my Opinion, were the outward Wars and Fightings of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and are con&s;idered in that Light by religious Writers of many Denominations.</P>
<P>That the moral Law is the &s;tanding and unalter|able Rule of our Conduct, I grant, as far as it reach|es: But it is not from thence that a Scruple again&s;t Fighting ari&s;es. The ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us hath taught &s;ome Chri&s;tians (both by the immediate Dictates of his Spirit, and the Expre&s;&s;ion of his Will, when per&s;on|ally upon Earth) that the be&s;t Way to keep the Com|mandments, <HI>Thou &s;halt not Kill;</HI> and, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour;</HI> is not to harbour any Ill-will, or Revenge again&s;t any, but to <HI>Love Enemies,</HI> &amp;c. And that <HI>Thou &s;halt not commit Adultery</HI>&mdash;is be&s;t kept by forbearing to look upon a Woman with a lu&s;tful Eye, or to entertain &s;uch a Thought: And that <HI>Thou &s;halt not for&s;wear thy &s;elf,</HI> &amp;c. is be&s;t kept by Speaking the Truth, without Swearing at all.</P>
<P>The next Paragraph in the Sermon, and to <HI>Page</HI> 20, is to prove, <Q>That the Office of the Magi&s;trate nece&s;&s;arily requires War; and that it is his Duty to u&s;e it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Upon which I remark, That whenever the Magi&s;trate is convinced that the Doc|trines of Chri&s;t forbid War, it will be as much his Duty, as any other Man's, to render Obedience to tho&s;e Doctrines. However, the People called Qua|kers do not undertake to condemn our Superiors engaging in War, in the pre&s;ent unhappy State of human Affairs: We rather think it probable, that as they have &s;hewn a noble and Chri&s;tian Di&s;po&s;ition, in granting Liberty and Protection to &s;uch as are of tender Con&s;ciences, it may plea&s;e God to ble&s;s their Arms with Succe&s;s, and reward them for their Kind|ne&s;s

<P>We are now come to the Sermon's New Te&s;tament Proofs, which are thus u&s;her'd in, <Q>I may add, that the Lawfulne&s;s of War, e&s;pecially Defen&s;ive, is &s;ignified in the New Te&s;tament in divers In|&s;tances</Q>&mdash;If he makes this out to be true, I will ac|knowledge my&s;elf to have been mi&s;taken&mdash;The Words, "E&s;pecially Defen&s;ive," <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ould &s;eem to convey an Idea, as if the Lawfulne&s;s of offen&s;ive War was al&s;o &s;ignified in the New Te&s;tament&mdash;Let us ob&s;erve the Proofs.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is in <HI>Page</HI> 20, from the Behaviour of <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t to the Soldiers, who a&s;k'd him, <HI>What they &s;hould do? John</HI> told them, <HI>Do Violence to no Man, neither accu&s;e any fal&s;ely, and be con|tent with your Wages, Luke</HI> iii. 14. From whence this Writer argues thus:</P>
<P><Q>While he coun&s;els to be content with the Wages of War, does he not, of Nece&s;&s;ity, approve the Work? Or would he have Wages paid for No|thing? Can we rea&s;onably conjecture, that this in|&s;pired Per&s;on would give Directions how to conduct a Manner of Life that was &s;imply unlawful and hateful to God? Would he not rather have con|demned it ab&s;olutely, and exhorted the Soldiers &s;peedily to for&s;ake and abandon it?</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e (<HI>Poole</HI> &s;ays) were the <HI>Roman</HI> Soldiers, kept by them to maintain their Conque&s;t of <HI>Judea.</HI></Q> <HI>John</HI> was a <HI>Jew.</HI> Some of the&s;e <HI>Roman</HI> Soldiers hearing him preach Repentance, apply to him for &s;ome Advice. He very wi&s;ely tells them wherein to re|from
<PB N="24" REF="006239_0027_1028003EDC135120">their moral Conduct (which he did likewi&s;e to the Publicans, who a&s;ked the &s;ame Que&s;tion) as a preparatory Step to their receiving greater and more &s;ublime Doctrines. Now if ab&s;taining from War be the very Perfection of the Chri&s;tian Religion, that is, a Point the mo&s;t difficult to be learned, and harde&s;t for Nature to &s;ubmit to, is it likely or rea&s;onable to expect, that <HI>John,</HI> upon the <HI>Pagan</HI> Soldiers fir&s;t Ap|plication, &s;hould declare that to them? I think not. Nor can I conceive, that while he coun&s;els them to be content with their Wages, that he of Nece&s;&s;ity approves the Works they received it for&mdash;He might advi&s;e them to be content with their Wages, that they might not plunder and rob tho&s;e among whom they were &s;tationed: And if I were in &s;uch a Situation, that is, &s;aw my own Nation &s;ubject to Soldiers of a foreign Power, though my religious Principles might not permit me to fight, yet I could freely advi&s;e &s;uch Soldiers to be ea&s;y, and content to live upon the Pay their Ma&s;ter allowed them, without ravaging and plundering my Rela|tives and Countrymen. There is not therefore the lea&s;t Proof from this Argument, that War is law|ful, but the rever&s;e; for <HI>John</HI> forbad doing Vio|lence to any Man; Can War &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Vio|lence?</P>
<P><Q>Nor did (&s;aith the Sermon, <HI>Page</HI> 21) our Lord Je&s;us rebuke the Centurion or <HI>Roman</HI> Cap|tain on Account of his military Employment, when he apply'd to him for the Cure of his &s;ick Servant; but commended his Faith, tho' he u&s;ed his Calling as an Argument to &s;upport it.</Q> This, and the Remainder of the Paragraph, which puts the Proof upon our Saviour's not taking that Op|portunity to declare again&s;t War, is likewi&s;e no Sa|tisfaction to me on this Point&mdash;Our Saviour did not initiate the <HI>Romans,</HI> or any others, upon their fir&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="006239_0028_1028004065719628">Belief in him, into the whole Nature and De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel: His own Di&s;ciples, long after they had followed him, were &s;o ignorant, that they thought he intended to a&s;&s;ume an outward Kingdom: Our Lord knew that the be&s;t Method to deal with frail fallen Mortals, was to lead them by Degrees, and not at once to Perfection.&mdash;If the Sermon-writer could have proved that after this Miracle, which our Lord wrought upon the Centurion's te&s;tifying &s;uch an extraordinary Degree of Faith, that he e&s;pou&s;ed the Doctrines, and joined him&s;elf with the Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, that he became a faithful A&s;&s;erter of the Principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and yet retained his military Employ, there would have been &s;ome Foun|dation for his Argument; but as he hath not, I can|not &s;ee that the Pa&s;&s;age is any Thing to his Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>But methinks (&s;aith the Sermon, <HI>Page</HI> 22) our Lord &s;ignifies his Approbation of War more expre&s;sly el&s;ewhere, in the&s;e Words, <HI>My King|dom is not of this World; if my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants fight, that I &s;hould not be delivered to the Jews</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xviii. 36.</NOTE> The Mean|ing of which is apparently this, That tho' War and Fighting is no proper Mean to promote the Spiritual Kingdom of Chri&s;t, yet that if the Na|ture and De&s;ign of his Humiliation had permitted him to a&s;&s;ume a Temporal Crown, then his Ser|vants ought to fight, in Defence of his Per&s;on and Dignity.</Q></P>
<P>I think this apparent Meaning not deducible from the Text&mdash;<HI>Pilate</HI> had a&s;ked Chri&s;t, if he was the King of the <HI>Jews?</HI> In An&s;wer he lets him know that his Kingdom was not of this World, which him&s;elf might ea&s;ily perceive, by his not permitting his Servants to fight for him. <HI>Poole</HI> thus interprets that Pa&s;&s;age;&mdash;<Q>I cannot deny but that I am the

Here's none of my Di&s;ciples takes up Arms, or offereth to fight for me; which is a plain Evidence that I pretend to no kingly Power in Di&s;turbance of the <HI>Roman</HI> Government.</Q></P>
<P>If this be the fair and genuine Meaning of the Pa&s;|&s;age, it does not imply that "his Servants ought to fight"&mdash;nor in the lea&s;t Degree &s;hew an expre&s;s Approbation of War, as the Sermon-writer hath vainly imagined&mdash;And here I &s;hall de&s;ire him to con&s;ider, whether Chri&s;t's directing us to pray that his Will may be done in Earth as it is in Heaven, doth not much more clearly expre&s;s an Injunction to live in Love and Peace.</P>
<P><Q>Does not (&s;aith the Sermon, <HI>Page</HI> 23) <HI>Luke</HI> the Evangeli&s;t highly commend <HI>Cornelius,</HI> the Centurion of the <HI>Italian</HI> Band, without any Mix|ture of Invective upon his martial Office?

<P>But is <HI>Cornelius</HI> commended by the Evangeli&s;t, or the Angel, for his military Po&s;t? Does either of them &s;ay a Word of the Con&s;i&s;tency of it with the Doctrines he was about to receive? No; he is com|mended for being <HI>A devout Man, and one that fear|ed God, with all his Hou&s;e, which gave much Alms to the People, and prayed to God alway:</HI> This Character he had, before he was in&s;tructed in the

Whether he continued in his military Station, after <HI>Peter</HI> had taught him, and he received the Holy Gho&s;t, the Hi&s;tory is &s;ilent; but to make the Compari&s;on of any Weight in &s;upport of War, it mu&s;t fir&s;t be proved that he did.</P>
<P><Q>The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> plainly (&s;aith the Sermon, <HI>Page</HI> 23) in&s;inuates the Lawfulne&s;s of War, in that Expre&s;&s;ion of his, where he enjoins us to live peaceably as much as po&s;&s;ible with all Men; which &s;uppo&s;es that it is &s;ometimes impracticable, impo&s;&s;ible.</Q></P>
<P>Here again I differ in Sentiment from this Wri|ter; the Apo&s;tle's Words are, <HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 18. <HI>If it be po&s;&s;ible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all Men</HI>&mdash;Which I think is as much as to &s;ay, Whatever A&s;&s;ronts or Provocations you may re|ceive, let it not anger you, or beget any De&s;ire in you to return Injury for Injury, tho' &s;ome may make War upon you, or try to di&s;turb you, yet let nothing appear on your Side but a meek and quiet Spirit, which is willing to &s;uffer ill Treatment, rather than let a quarrel&s;ome or warring Di&s;po&s;ition appear. The Apo&s;tle had in the preceding Ver&s;e exhorted, <HI>Recompence to no Man Evil for Evil</HI>&mdash; And in the la&s;t Ver&s;e of &s;ame Chapter, he again pre&s;&s;es the &s;ame meek and forgiving Behaviour, <HI>Be not overcome with Evil, but overcome Evil with Good</HI>&mdash;<Q>This Ver&s;e (faith <HI>Poole</HI>) is a divine Apho|ri&s;m; therein the Apo&s;tle anticipates an Objection: Some might be ready to &s;ay, if we &s;hould follow this Advice, we &s;hould be counted Cowards and Da&s;tards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To this he An&s;wers, That 'tis the ready Way to be Triumphers and Conque|rors.
<PB N="28" REF="006239_0031_1028004B6CC6FB70">By Evil here, he means the Wrongs and Injuries of Men; and to be overcome of Evil, is to be moved and provoked thereby to Impati|ence or Malice; when 'tis thus with a Man, he is overcome or conquered: In Revenge of Inju|ries, he is a Lo&s;er that gets the better. There|fore he exhorts us rather to overcome Evil with Good, that is a noble Victory indeed: This is the Way not to be even with him that wrongs us, but to be above him; thus <HI>David</HI> overcame <HI>Saul,</HI> and <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> the Bands of <HI>Syria.</HI> This is the Way to overcome our&s;elves, and our Adver&s;aries too; our&s;elves, in denying our Lu&s;ts that egg us on to Revenge; our Adver&s;aries, in winning them to relent and acknowledge their Mi&s;carriages.</Q></P>
<P>Now Reader, con&s;ider this Interpretation, com|pare it with the Precept, <HI>Recompence to no Man Evil for Evil,</HI> and then try if thou can'&s;t conceive that the Apo&s;tle intended (when he advi&s;ed <HI>to live peace|ably as much as po&s;&s;ible with all Men</HI>) to in&s;inuate the Lawfulne&s;s of War.</P>
<P>The next Ob&s;ervation in the Sermon, is from the Improbability of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI>'s recording the military Prowe&s;s and Exploits of divers antient He|roes, as <HI>Gideon, Barack, Samp&s;on, &amp;c.</HI> with|out the lea&s;t Hint of any Alteration in Go&s;pel Times in that Re&s;pect, and vet he him&s;elf of a contrary Sentiment. But where is this Difficulty? Does not the Apo&s;tle in the &s;ame Chapter commend the Faith of <HI>Abraham</HI> in leaving his own Country, and offer|ing up his only Son <HI>I&s;aac</HI> at the Command of God? Now will or can this be con&s;trued to infer, that becau&s;e <HI>Abraham</HI> did the&s;e Things at the divine Command, and the Apo&s;tle does not give the lea&s;t Hint of any Alteration in Go&s;pel Times in that Re|&s;pect, that therefore a Chri&s;tian may follow that Ex|ample without &s;uch Command? And yet this Con|&s;equence
<PB N="29" REF="006239_0032_1028004CF35B6278">is as fair, as to infer that becau&s;e <HI>Gideon, &amp;c.</HI> did go to War at the Command of God (which this Writer grants tho&s;e Worthies did) and the Apo&s;tle commends them for it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that there|fore Chri&s;tians may follow their Example without &s;uch Command&mdash;If, however, this Pa&s;&s;age is in|tended only to vindicate the Conduct of &s;uch who go to War in Obedience to the Command of God&mdash; I &s;hall not pretend to &s;ay that &s;uch War is unlawful. The Object of the Faith, through which tho&s;e Wor|thies wrought &s;uch Wonders, was, <HI>Deus loquens, &amp;c.</HI> God &s;peaking, and conveying to them a clear Knowledge of Duty, and A&s;&s;urance of Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>But we are told that <HI>Paul</HI> <Q>virtually and con&s;e|quentially &s;ignified his Approbation of War by his Practice, in not rejecting the Protection of an arm'd Force;</Q> and <HI>Acts</HI> xxiii. is referr'd to for a Proof&mdash;I reque&s;t the Reader to peru&s;e the Chapter, and he will not find that <HI>Paul</HI> did &s;o much as make any Application for the Protection of an arm'd Force, though he knew there was a Con&s;piracy form'd for the taking away his Life; he only took the nece&s;&s;ary Steps to inform the Chief Captain (in who&s;e Cu&s;tody he was) of that De&s;ign, not doubt|ing but he would have &s;o much Ju&s;tice, as to pre|vent &s;uch a private Murder. The Chief Captain being thus informed of the De&s;ign, &s;ends a Number of Soldiers, who, <HI>as it was commanded them,</HI> &s;aith the Text, <HI>took Paul, and brought him by Night to Antipatris.</HI></P>
<P>Now, would it be rea&s;onable or prudent, &s;uppo&s;ing the Apo&s;tle to have been ever &s;o clear in his Judg|ment, that War was unlawful to Chri&s;tians, for him, then a Pri&s;oner, to refu&s;e being conducted by the Soldiers, whither their Superior had ordered them to take him.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="006239_0033_1028004FC1EF21E8">
We are told in the Sermon, <HI>Page</HI> 25, That the Apo&s;tle <HI>James,</HI> in <HI>Chap.</HI> iv. 1. does not &s;ay, <Q>That War is ever unju&s;t and &s;inful upon both Sides, or unnece&s;&s;ary in Man's fallen State, but that the original Cau&s;e of War is Evil,</Q> or proceeding from Lu&s;t.&mdash;</P>
<P>Can a true Chri&s;tian then, who hath known the Ax laid to the Root of the Tree; <HI>i. e.</HI> The Spirit of God giving him Victory over Lu&s;t, join with, countenance or encourage, that which hath Lu&s;t for its Original?

<P><Q>But (&s;aith the Sermon) it is again objected, that the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> that <HI>The Weapons of their Warfare were not carnal.</HI></Q>

<P><Q>There is (&s;aith the Sermon) a great Difference between the War we mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain between Sin and Satan, and a War with wicked Men. To pretend to vanqui&s;h the former by carnal Weapons, is as

<P><Q>It is pre&s;umptuous (&s;aith the Sermon) to expect an End without the U&s;e of Means adapted to it: To expect a Crop by the Dint of our Supplications, without Plowing, Sowing and Fencing, our Ground, would be exceeding fond and vain: And &s;o to ex|pect Protection from unrea&s;onable and violent Men, without u&s;ing proper Means for Defence, on Account of our Piety and Prayers, is equally unrea&s;onable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>

<P>This Con&s;truction appears to me to be abundant|ly too much confined&mdash;A Prohibition of Injuries, and a Command to endure them, mu&s;t be con&s;ider|ed as relative to the Con&s;equence if allowed&mdash;A &s;mall Injury is attended with a Degree of Inju&s;tice, and the enduring it, rather than returning it, &s;hews in &s;ome Degree a Chri&s;tian Di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;Now con&s;ider that Con&s;equence with re&s;pect to greater; the endu|ring of them rather than returning Evil for Evil, doth certainly &s;hew a much greater Degree of that <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Lowline&s;s of Heart</HI> which Chri&s;t taught his Di&s;ciples to <HI>learn of him</HI>&mdash;And indeed were but his Example con&s;idered, as explanatory of his Laws, it would amount to a full Proof that he intended to prohibit all Return of Injuries among his Followers.</P>
<P>Again, if every particular Member of the Church be forbidden Revenge, it is becau&s;e allowing of it would manife&s;t a want of Patience and Fortitude to endure, and encourage Envy, Strife, Malice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which produces De&s;truction to Particulars&mdash;Surely then this Rea&s;on is much &s;tronger for forbidding national and publick Revenge&mdash;Becau&s;e allowing it produces tho&s;e wicked Fruits in an abundant greater and more univer&s;al Manner&mdash;Be&s;ides, Can tho&s;e who are &s;eparately forbid a Thing, be at Liberty collec|tively to do it&mdash;Suppo&s;e ten Men are each com|manded by their Prince to ab&s;tain from a particular Diet, becau&s;e it is pernicious; it cannot &s;urely be a|greeable to that Prince that the&s;e ten Men together

<P>And according to the Rea&s;on given by Chri&s;t him&s;elf immediately after tho&s;e Precepts, they mu&s;t certainly intend a Prohibition of all Injury and Re|venge, or el&s;e the Compari&s;on is not very proper&mdash; <HI>That ye may be the Children of your Father in Heaven</HI>&mdash; For he di&s;pences his temporal Ble&s;&s;ings upon all, even upon the mo&s;t publickly Prophane; upon Bla&s;|phemers, Idolaters, and the vile&s;t of human Race. Will my putting up with &s;mall and tolerable Injuries, not indulging private Revenge, but re&s;i&s;ting with Violence great Injuries, and returning with my ut|mo&s;t Force all the Evil in my Power, in Revenge for national Grievances, be coming up to this Com|pari&s;on of the Almighty's univer&s;al Beneficence and Kindne&s;s to tho&s;e that do their utmo&s;t to affront and di&s;plea&s;e him?

I have now gone through the Arguments u&s;ed in the Sermon to prove the Lawfulne&s;s of War, I think I have not omitted any that are material, nor I hope done any Inju&s;tice to them. I have expre&s;s'd my Thoughts why they are not &s;ufficient for the Purpo&s;e for which they were intended, and &s;hall take Leave of this Writer, with remarking the great Difference between his Mu&s;ing, mention'd in <HI>Page</HI> 36, and the Di&s;po&s;ition of a true Chri&s;tian: The latter is re&s;ign'd in all Things; con&s;iders this Life as a State of Probation and Tryal; acknowledges an over-ruling Providence, who &s;uperintends human Affairs; and can &s;ay, Come Life or come Death, thy Will, O God, be done&mdash;Whereas the former di&s;|covers the utmo&s;t Surprize and Con&s;ternation even at imaginary Dangers, and in his Fright &s;eems to forget his Maker&mdash;The next Time he hears Great Guns go off, I would recommend to him the Peru|&s;al of the following Ob&s;ervations from <HI>John We&s;ley</HI>'s Journal, <HI>Page</HI> 67.</P>
<P><Q>Finding the unaccountable Apprehen&s;ions of I know not what Danger (the Wind being &s;mall, and the Sea &s;mooth) which had been upon me &s;e|veral Days, increa&s;e; I cried earne&s;tly for Help; and it plea&s;ed God as in a Moment to re&s;tore Peace to my Soul. Let me ob&s;erve hereon, 1. That not one of the&s;e Hours ought to pa&s;s out of my Remembrance, till I attain another Manner of Spirit, a Spirit equally willing to glorify God by Life or by Death. 2. That whoever is unea&s;y on any Account (bodily Pain alone excepted) carries in him&s;elf his own Conviction, that he is &s;o far an Unbeliever. Is he unea&s;y at the Apprehen&s;ion of Death? Then he believeth not, <HI>That to die is Gain.</HI> At any of the Events of Life? Then he hath not a firm Belief, <HI>That all Things work together for his Good.</HI> And if he bring the Matter more clo&s;e,
<PB N="47" REF="006239_0050_102800811D5844A0">he will always find, be&s;ide the general want of Faith, every particular Unea&s;ine&s;s is evidently ow|ing to the want of &s;ome particular Chri&s;tian Tem|per.</Q></P>
<P>I would now offer &s;omething further to the Con|&s;ideration of the Reader.</P>
<P>I think it is univer&s;ally allowed that the Reign of Chri&s;t is de&s;cribed by the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> in Chap. xi. where, among other Expre&s;&s;ions which denotes that wherever it came to be truly received, it would produce Meekne&s;s, Humility and Peace, even in the roughe&s;t Tempers and Di&s;po&s;itions of Men, he hath this, <HI>They &s;hall not burt nor de&s;troy in all my holy Mountain; for the Earth &s;hall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea.</HI> Some of the antient Writers among&s;t the primitive Chri&s;tians, as <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr, Theodoret, &amp;c.</HI> took the holy Mountain in this Prophecy to be &s;poken of the Church of Chri&s;t; and they appeal'd to the <HI>Gen|tiles,</HI> whether they did not &s;ee and ob&s;erve, by the Behaviour and Manners of the Chri&s;tians, a Fulfil|ling of tho&s;e glorious Prophecies: Such was then the Peaceablene&s;s and Innocency of their Lives.</P>
<P><HI>Poole</HI> likewi&s;e &s;ays, the Mountain here means the Church, and adds, <Q>Wherever the Go&s;pel comes and prevails, it will have this Effect.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame Prophet, in Chap. xxxv. &s;peaking of the Way of the Lord, &s;ays, <HI>No Lion &s;hall be there, nor any ravenous Bea&s;t &s;hall go up thereon; it &s;hall not be found there, but the Redeemed &s;hall walk there</HI> &mdash;And again confirms this, Chap. lxv. repeating, <HI>They &s;hall not burt nor de&s;troy in all my holy Moun|tain, &s;aith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The Prophet <HI>Ho&s;ea,</HI> &s;peaking of Go&s;pel-times, in Chap. ii. &s;aith, Ver&s;e 18. <HI>And in that Day will I make a Covenant for them, with the Bea&s;ts of the Field, and with the Fowls of Heaven, and with the
<PB N="48" REF="006239_0051_10280082A4C65E20">creeping Things of the Ground; and I will break the Bow, and the Sword, and the Battle out of the Earth, and will make them to lie down &s;afely.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Poole</HI> upon this Ver&s;e remarks, <Q>It is a full and gracious Promi&s;e of Abundance of Peace, Safety, and Love among all through the Creation. But if brute Bea&s;ts do not hurt, yet unle&s;s more bruti&s;h Creatures, bloody Men, be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">med, there will be little Safety to the Church; therefore God will put an End to Wars, and make Men peaceable in their Di&s;po&s;itions, far more peaceable than heretofore they have been.</Q></P>
<P>The Prophet <HI>Micah,</HI> in &s;peaking of the latter Days, u&s;es much the &s;ame Expre&s;&s;ions with <HI>I&s;aiah &mdash; And he &s;hall judge among many People, and re|buke &s;trong Nations afar off, and they &s;hall beat their Swords into Plow&s;hares, and their Spears into pru|ning Hooks: Nation &s;hall not lift up a Sword again&s;t Nation, neither &s;hall they learn War any more,</HI> Chap. iv. 3.</P>
<P>The&s;e Predictions, and &s;ome others of the like Tendency, together with the Examples and Te&s;ti|monies of the Apo&s;tles and primitive Chri&s;tians, that Obedience to the Go&s;pel had that Effect, not only to give them inward Peace, but to take away the U&s;e of carnal Weapons, are very &s;trong and cogent Proofs, that War cannot be con&s;i&s;tent with the Pu|rity and Perfection of the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P>And here I would further ob&s;erve, that when the Angel had appeared to the Shepherds, and declared the Birth of Chri&s;t&mdash;<HI>There was with the Angel a Multitude of the heavenly Ho&s;t, prai&s;ing God, and &s;aying, Glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on Earth Peace, Good-will towards Men</HI>

I have already mentioned &s;ome of the Te&s;timonies of the Antients on War, and it may not be improper to add a few more.

<P>In the Time of <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> (which was the Beginning of the third Century after Chri&s;t) Chri&s;tians were &s;o far from Wars, that he te&s;tify'd, that they had no Marks or Signs of Violence among them, &s;aying, <Q>Neither are the Faces of Idols to be painted, which &s;o much as to regard is forbidden, neither Sword, nor Bow, to them that follow Peace: As <HI>Sylvius Di&s;c. de Rev. Belg.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>M. Aurelius Antoninus,</HI> about the Middle of the &s;econd Century, writes thus: <Q>I pray'd to my Country Gods, but when I was neglected by them, and ob&s;erved my&s;elf pre&s;&s;ed by the Ene|my; con&s;idering the Fewne&s;s of my Forces, I cal|led to one, and intreated tho&s;e who with us are cal|led Chri&s;tians, and I found a great Number of them, and I forced them with Threats, which ought not to have been; becau&s;e afterwards I knew their Strength and Force. Therefore they betook them|&s;elves neither to the U&s;e of Darts, nor Trumpets, for they u&s;e not &s;o to do, for the Cau&s;e and Name of their God, which they bear in their Con&s;ciences.</Q></P>

<P><HI>Origen</HI> (who wrote in the Beginning of the third Century) in his An&s;wer to <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> a mo&s;t virulent Adver&s;ary, who had charged the Chri&s;tians with re|fu&s;ing to bear Arms, and to enter into military Em|ployments, writes thus
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Origines contra Cel&s;um, Lib.</HI> 8. <HI>P.</HI> 426, <HI>Cantabrigiae Editio.</HI></NOTE>:</P>
<P><Q>La&s;tly, <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> exhorts us, That we &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t the Emperor with all our Might, and aid him in all his ju&s;t Undertakings and Engagements, and when requi&s;ite, bear Arms, and fight for him. To this we an&s;wer, that we do a&s;&s;i&s;t the Emperors, if I may &s;o &s;ay, with a Divine Aid, having on us the whole Ar|mour of God; and this we do, in Obedience to the Words of the Apo&s;tle, who &s;ays, <HI>I exhort, therefore, fir&s;t of all, Supplications, Prayers, Interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of Thanks to be made for all Men; for Kings, and for all that are in Authority.</HI> And by how much the more pious any Man is, by &s;o much the more he lends A&s;&s;i&s;tance to Emperors, yea more than they who &s;tand in Battle Array, and cut down as many of the Enemy as they can. We may al&s;o reply to you, who are not of our Belief, and urge us to bear Arms and Fight; your own Prie&s;ts, and tho&s;e who belong to your Temples, keep their Hands from being defil'd with Blood, by Rea&s;on of the Sacrifices they mu&s;t offer with unbloody and unpolluted Hands, to tho&s;e you e|&s;teem your Gods. And when you go to War, you never take any of the prie&s;tly Order for Sol|diers. If then you think that rea&s;onable, Why &s;hould you not think it more &s;o in tho&s;e, who, when others go out to fight, they, as Prie&s;ts and Mini&s;ters of God, lift up holy Hands, and wre&s;tle in Prayer with God, for them who fight in a ju&s;t

Therefore all evil Spirits, which &s;tir up Sedition, break Treaties, and di&s;turb the publick Peace, being qua&s;h'd by our Prayers, we do greater Service to Emperors than tho&s;e who are for Fighting: And we labour for the common Good, by putting up Prayers in Holine&s;s; and by our religious Exerci&s;es and Practice, we teach how to de&s;pi&s;e and &s;hun the plea&s;ing Baits of Sin. Thus we fight better than others for the Emperor: But &s;hould he go about to compel us to Fight, or bear Arms under him, we cannot do it. <HI>Sic nos prae aliis pugnamus pro Imperatore: cum ip&s;o, licet nos impellat, non militamus.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is a full and plain Declaration of the Opini|on and Practice of the Chri&s;tians&mdash;'Tis not <HI>Origen</HI>'s &s;ingle Opinion, but an Apology in Behalf of the Chri&s;tians in <HI>Origen</HI>'s Time; and they were then very numerous.</P>
