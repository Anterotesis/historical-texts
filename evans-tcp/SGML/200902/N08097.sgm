<L>'TIS fini&s;h'd, thus the Saviour &s;aid,</L>
<L>Nor more could add the parting Breath;</L>
<L>Then lowly bow'd his &s;acred Head,</L>
<L>And &s;unk beneath the Stroke of Death.</L>
<L>Attendant Angels hov'ring round,</L>
<L>In louder Notes proclaim the Sound;</L>
<L>'Tis fini&s;h'd, as by Turns they &s;ung,</L>
<L>High Heav'n's aetherial Arch and golden Man&s;ions rung.</L>

<L>Ble&s;t JESUS! all thy Sorrows o'er,</L>
<L>Thy painful Labours here have End;</L>
<L>And yet thy faithful Saints deplore</L>
<L>Their long lo&s;t Ma&s;ter, Father, Friend.</L>
<L>But other Scenes thy Strength await,</L>
<L>A glorious and triumphant State;</L>
<L>GOD's Arm will his Anointed free,</L>
<L>Nor Hell can thee detain, Corruption's Pow'r to &s;ee.</L>

<L>From GOD alone our Ble&s;&s;ings flow,</L>
