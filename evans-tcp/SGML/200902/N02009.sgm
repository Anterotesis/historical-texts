<HEAD><HI>An ANSWER</HI> TO SOME <HI>Ca&s;es of Con&s;cience</HI> Re&s;pecting the COUNTRY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLOMON STODDARD, A. M. Pa&s;tor in <HI>Northampton.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>Que&s;t. I. <HI>WHEREIN doth the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Country principally con&s;i&s;t?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> THERE is an oppre&s;&s;ion of R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers often &s;poken of in Scripture. But be&s;ides that, there is an oppre&s;&s;ion contrary to commutative Ju&s;tice: this is committed principally in the&s;e three ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHEN they make the advantage of the ignorance of others. Men that are otherwi&s;e, knowing Men, are ignorant of the worth of &s;ome Commodities; and Men take that opportunity to extort from them. Men that are ignorant of the worth of things, have a dependance on the Integrity of the Seller, who thereby hath an Advantage to gain more than is meet. Sometimes they get twice the value of it. Mens ignorance doth expo&s;e them to become a prey to greedy Men. The Seller knows that could &s;ell it cheaper; but the Buyer is ignorant, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">. Sometimes Men &s;ell that which is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">h at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of that which is commendable. The Apothecary &s;ells his Drugs that have lo&s;t their vertue through age, to ignorant Men. It is an ea&s;y thing for crafty Men to abu&s;e tho&s;e that are ignorant. And in Coun|try Towns. Men &s;ometimes give a &s;hilling for that, which at the Mar|ket Town, might be had for &s;ix pence.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="2" REF="002387_0002_0FDB350AC7B35040">
2. WHEN they make their advantage of the Nece&s;&s;ities of particular Men: When there is a general Scarcity, the Market-price will inavoi|dably ri&s;e; but where there is no Market, particular per&s;ons may be in great nece&s;&s;ity; there be few in that Town that can &s;upply them. If they go to another Town to buy, the charge will be con&s;iderable; the Man is al&s;o in a &s;trait becau&s;e &s;trangers will not tru&s;t him, and the Seller takes that advantage to oppre&s;s him; the Scripture takes notice of the oppre&s;&s;ing the poor, <HI>Prov.</HI> 22.16. <HI>Prov.</HI> 14.31. It may be Lawyers may be guilty of taking exce&s;&s;ive Fees.</P>
<P N="3">3. WHEN they take the advantage on the good nature &amp; ingenuity of other Men, by lying in Debt beyond the proper time of payment, Mul|titudes of people in the Country are not beforehand, they &s;pend their Money before they have it; the extravagancy of their expences forces them to lie in Debt; the inevitable Providence of GOD ca&s;ts &s;ome Men behind hand; in that ca&s;e they &s;hould compound with their Creditors: but &s;ome through a profu&s;e way of living, can't conveniently pay their Debts: Hereby the Creditor is reduced to &s;traits, loo&s;es the improve|ment of his own E&s;tate; and &s;ometimes the Debt is lo&s;t; the Debtor dies, and there is no E&s;tate; the Creditor dies, and the Children can never recover their Father's dues. GOD was very &s;trict in requiring to pay the hireling his wages. <HI>Lev.</HI> 19.13.</P>
<P>Q. II. <HI>IS it lawfull for Men to &s;et their Dwelling Hou&s;es at &s;uch a distance from the place of Publick Wor&s;hip, that they and their Families cannot well attend it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> IT is lawfull to do it when a few make a beginning of a new Plantation under a pro&s;pect of obtaining the Ordinances in a little time. But it is quite Unwarrantable, where there is no &s;uch pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>WE read in Scripture of a <HI>Sabbath days journey:</HI> Acts 1.12. but that was a tradition, not an injunction. Some take it to be a Mile; &s;ome, two Miles, according to the different &s;ort of Cubits. It is tho't that the Armies of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> incamped in the Wilderne&s;s at that Di&s;tance from the Tabernacle, <HI>Num.</HI> 2.2. They are ordered to pitch over again&s;t the Tabernacle; we read it, far off about the Tabernacle. This is thought to be 2000 Cubits; becau&s;e there was to be that di&s;tance be|tween the Tabernacle and the People, when they pa&s;&s;ed over <HI>Jordan, Jo&s;h.</HI> 3.4. But &s;uppo&s;ing this to be, it will not prove that two Mile
<PB N="3" REF="002387_0003_0FDB350C427DF468">was a Sabbath days journey. For there is rea&s;on to think that when the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> encamped in the Wilderne&s;s, they took up the &s;pace of Twelve Miles &s;quare; &s;o that &s;ome of them would be &s;ix Miles off from the Tabernacle.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 1. THE Prophet, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 8.1, 2. <HI>directed</HI> the woman of <HI>Shun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> to remove out of the Country, becau&s;e of an approaching Famin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and &s;he &s;ojourned in the land of the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> &s;even Years. And it is very probable, that th&oacute; the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were cut off from wor&s;hip|ping at the Temple, being commanded to &s;acrifice at <HI>Dan</HI> and <HI>Bethe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> yet they had places near, where the law was publickly read, and pub|lick Prayers made: yet &s;he is directed to live el&s;e where.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> THE Land of the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> joined to the Land of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and &s;he might have opportunity by going two or three Miles, to join with &s;ome of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in Wor&s;hip; yea the north-ea&s;t parts of the Land of the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> was not very far from the Temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and &s;he might have better opportunity for Wor&s;hip, than in her own Land.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 2. IT &s;eems the Woman of <HI>Shunem</HI> was wont to travel on the Sabbath to Mount <HI>Carmel,</HI> which was twelve Miles, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 4.25.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> IT doth not appear that it was ordinary for her to go thither on the Sabbath; th&ocirc; po&s;&s;ibly &s;he might on &s;ome extraordinary occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Q. III. <HI>IS not the depreciating the Bills of Publick Credit matter of Provocation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> IT mu&s;t needs be; for great wrong is done to many Per&s;ons who have received them according to their denomination; and have been forced to put them off as if they were of le&s;s Value. Some Men are able to help them&s;elves, by getting greater wages for their Work, and advancing the price of what they bring to the Market; but others have been great Sufferers by this practice; and if ever the Bills are called in; &s;uch as are in debt, either to the Publick, or to particular Per&s;ons, will be great loo&s;ers. It may be, &s;ome of them will be undone thereby. The temptation to the Merchants was to get the Money into their own hands, that thereby they might make Returns to <HI>England.</HI> They would give thirty &s;hillings in <HI>Eills,</HI> for twenty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Silver.</HI> And they may afford it, that have Sold, and do &s;ell, their Goods at exece&s;&s;ive Rates. They are under no nece&s;&s;ity to do thus: for they have the command of the Market, and might buy the
<PB N="4" REF="002387_0004_0FDB351006F76E98">produce of the Country at &s;uch prices, that they might make as profi|table Returns, as now they do.</P>
<P>Q. IV. <HI>Is it Lawfull to wear long Hair?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> IT was the Cu&s;tom in <HI>England</HI> to cut their Hair all off, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> humour, as Dr. <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> off his Hair. This cu&s;tom continued for about three&s;core years: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by degrees. Men took a greater liberty; th&ocirc; &s;ome Men placed Re|ligion in it: yet in length of time, they were not &s;o &s;crupulous as for|merly. And &s;ome wore their Hair very long. And many of tho&s;e that wear Periwigs, u&s;e &s;uch as are of a very great length. And the cu&s;tom doth now prevail among Pious People. But it &s;eems utterly Unlawful to wear their Hair long; It is a geat Burden and Cumber; it is Effi|minacy, and a va&s;t Expence.</P>
<P>ONE Scripture that condemns it, 1 Cor. 11.14. <HI>Doth not even nature it &s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> you, that if a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> long hair, it is a &s;hame to him?</HI> That which the light of Nature condemns, is a Moral Evil. The light of Nature is to be our Rule in ordinary ca&s;es. The rea&s;on why it is a &s;hame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wear long Hair is, becau&s;e it is a Sin: the light of Nature doth condemn it; therefore it is &s;infull.</P>
<P>THE principal Objection that is brought to evade the Authority of this Place, is. That by <HI>Nature,</HI> Cu&s;tom is meant. So Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> it: I judge he doth it, that he may &s;trengthen him&s;elf in his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">,</HI> that he may have the better pretence to expound it &s;o, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 2.3. where it is &s;aid, <HI>We are by nature children of wrath, even as others.</HI> His Expo&s;ition there is contrary to the Rule of <HI>Faith;</HI> and in this Place, contrary to the Rule of <HI>Life.</HI> We &s;ometimes &s;ay that Cu&s;tom is a &s;econd nature: yet it is never &s;o u&s;ed in the Scripture: the Inter|pretation is without Precedent: and the Apo&s;tle being pre&s;ently after t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;peak of Cu&s;tom, u&s;eth another word: 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.16. He &s;aith, We have no &s;uch <HI>Cu&s;tom.</HI> The Apo&s;tles Expre&s;&s;ion is very remarkable, He &s;aith <HI>even Nature it &s;elf,</HI> as if he had fore&s;een that Men would put a fal&s;e interpretation on his words. He doth not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tent him&s;elf to &s;ay, <HI>Na|ture,</HI> but that they may not &s;uppo&s;e he meant <HI>Cu&s;tom.</HI> He &s;aith, <HI>Even Nature it &s;elf</HI> U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dly he was guided therein by the Spirit of GOD. <HI>Be&s;ides,</HI> it was not true, that <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> taught them that it was a &s;hame for a Man to wear long H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for it was the <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> of the <HI>Greeks</HI> to wear
<PB N="5" REF="002387_0005_0FDB351134DE7068">their Hair <HI>long:</HI> The <HI>Remans</HI> wore their Hair <HI>&s;hort;</HI> but the <HI>Greeks</HI> wore their Hair <HI>long. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mer</HI> calls the Grecians <HI>Comati Acbivi.</HI> And when <HI>Alexander</HI> was in a rage with <HI>Ca&s;&s;ander</HI> one of his Nobles; he took him by the Hair, and knocked his head again&s;t the wall. Moreover in the next ver&s;e, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.13. The Apo&s;tle to &s;hew, that Nature teaches Wo|men to wear their Hair <HI>long;</HI> He &s;aith, <HI>if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given her for a covering.</HI> GOD gave it to <HI>Women</HI> for a covering, but not to <HI>Men.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER Scripture doth al&s;o condemn it, <HI>viz.</HI> Ezek. 44.20. <HI>Nei|ther &s;hall they &s;have their heads, nor &s;uffer their locks to grow long, they &s;hall only poll their heads.</HI> Here are two Extreams forbid; <HI>Shaving the head,</HI> and <HI>&s;uffering their locks to grow long.</HI> This mu&s;t either &s;ignify &s;ome &s;piritual thing; but no Man can devi&s;e what; or &s;ome Go&s;pel In|&s;titution; and if &s;o, why is it not enjoyned unto Mini&s;ters in the New Te&s;tament, or el&s;e it is a Moral Law: and &s;o it mu&s;t be. One part of it, is &s;urely Moral; <HI>They &s;hall not &s;have their heads;</HI> therefore the other part is Moral al&s;o; <HI>They &s;hall not &s;uffer their locks to grow long.</HI></P>
<P>THE Command of GOD requiring the Nazarites to nouri&s;h their Hair, is no vindication of long Hair; but a forcible rea&s;on again&s;t it; which will appear, if we con&s;ider two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. SUCH Actions, as under their <HI>ordinary</HI> circum&s;tances are Moral Evils; under <HI>extraordinary</HI> circum&s;tances, be very good: So for <HI>Brothers</HI> and <HI>Si&s;ters</HI> to joyn in Wedlock, as <HI>Adam's</HI> Children did: For the <HI>Brother,</HI> among the <HI>Jews,</HI> to Marry his <HI>Brother</HI>'s Wife: So, for a Phy&s;ician, to give an intoxicating Potion: to do that which ordinarily, is contrary to a Rule of Mode&s;ty. One Command, in many ca&s;es, mu&s;t give way to another.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Nazarites were to deny them&s;elves many comforts, to &s;hew us that we &s;hould be mortified to the things of this World. Upon a Religious account, they were to ab&s;tain from Wine &amp; Rai&s;ins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and upon that account, they were to deny them&s;elves of that neatne&s;s and comeline&s;s in wearing their Hair, that was a duty in other Men.</P>
<P>IT was a part of the Calamity that came upon <HI>Nebuchadne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ar,</HI> that his Hairs were grown like Eagles Feathers, <HI>and his Nailes like birds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">laws,</HI> Dan. 4.23.</P>
<P>[The following Letter, written by the &s;ame learned Author many years ago, may be here in&s;erted.]</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="6" REF="002387_0006_0FDB351298A59DB8">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with your de&s;ire, I now &s;end you my Thoughts con|cerning <HI>Periwigs.</HI> I cannot &s;ee &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to condemn them Univer&s;ally. GOD does allow Man, by <HI>Art</HI> to &s;upply the defects of <HI>Nature.</HI> Hair artificially prepared may &s;upply as fully &amp; innocently, the want of Hair, as any other matter artificially prepared.</P>
<P>But yet I judge that there is abundance of Sin, in this Country, in wearing <HI>Perwigs.</HI> Particularly, in the&s;e two things;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, When Men do wear them needle&s;sly, in compliance with the Fa&s;hion. Their own Hair <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ufficient for all tho&s;e Ends that GOD has given Hair for. One Man's Hair is comlier than another's. And &s;o it is with their Faces, and Bodies. Some cut off their Own becau&s;e of the Colour; it is <HI>Red</HI> or <HI>Grey;</HI> Some, becau&s;e it is <HI>Streight;</HI> Some, be|cau&s;e it is <HI>Frizel'd;</HI> and &s;ome, only, becau&s;e it is their <HI>Own.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, When tho&s;e that may have ju&s;t occa&s;ion to wear them, doe wear them in &s;uch a Ruffianly way, as it would be utterly unlaw|full to wear their own Hair in. Some of them are of an un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;onable <HI>Length;</HI> and generally, they are extravagant as to their <HI>Bu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>We have no certain way to pa&s;s a Judgment upon this <HI>Practice,</HI> but by comparing it with &s;uch general Moral Rules, as we are bound to Ob|&s;erve. It renders it &s;omewhat <HI>Su&s;picious,</HI> that the <HI>Practice</HI> did at fir&s;t take it's ri&s;e from very <HI>Corrupt</HI> Men; and that it was long, before it did obtain among tho&s;e that were <HI>godly.</HI> But if it di&s;agree with Moral Rules; it is altogether to be Condemned.</P>
<P>The <HI>Practice</HI> &s;eems, to me, to have the&s;e four <HI>Evils</HI> in it:</P>
<P N="1">1. It is an <HI>Uncontentedne&s;s</HI> with that Provi&s;ion that GOD has made for Men. GOD has generally given Men &s;uch Hair as is co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly; and a &s;ufficiency of it. And when it is &s;o, Men have cau&s;e to be well &s;atis|fyed. When GOD has given to Men &s;uch Hair as is &s;utable to an&s;wer the Ends of Hair; It &s;eems to be a <HI>De&s;pi&s;ing</HI> of the Goodne&s;s of GOD, to cut it off, in compliance with a Vain Fa&s;hion. If GOD lay Affliction upon them; they may u&s;e lawfull Methods, to moderate the Affliction: But the&s;e Men, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> GOD be Bountifull to them, <HI>are not Contented to be at His Finding.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It is <HI>Wa&s;tifullne&s;s.</HI> Abundance of Money is <HI>needle&s;sly</HI> &s;pent in maintaining this <HI>Practice.</HI> Some of the Men that u&s;e it, have need enough of the Money other ways; and lay them&s;elves under Tempta|tion by this <HI>Extravagancy,</HI> either to oppre&s;s Men in their Dealings<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or
<PB N="7" REF="002387_0007_0FDB3513DB583A98">to be more Pinching in other Ca&s;es, than they ought to be. And tho&s;e Men that have more plentiful E&s;tates, have no Liberty to u&s;e them ac|cording to their own Plea&s;ure. That Money that may be laid out to <HI>Advantage,</HI> &s;hould not be &s;pent <HI>Unprofitably.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It is <HI>Pride:</HI> they do it to make a great <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">;</HI> It is from an Affectation of <HI>Swaggering;</HI> it is an Affecting of <HI>Finery</HI> that there is no ju&s;t occa&s;ion for. They count it <HI>Brave</HI> to be in the Fa&s;hion; crave the honour of being counted as <HI>Gallant</HI> as others. It is too much <HI>Flanting.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. It is <HI>contrary to Gravity.</HI> There is a Ma&s;culine Gravity that &s;hould appear in the Countenances of Men, di&s;covering a Solemnity of Spirit. But this <HI>Fractice</HI> is <HI>Light,</HI> and <HI>Effeminat.</HI> Tho it make a <HI>Shew;</HI> yet it takes much away from the Pre&s;ence of Men. Such <HI>Curip&s;ity</HI> di&s;|covers much <HI>Vanity</HI> in the Mind; and makes others to e&s;teem the more lightly of them; and not to &s;hew that Re&s;pect to them. This <HI>Practice</HI> makes them look, as if they were more di&s;pos'd <HI>to Court a Maid;</HI> than to bear upon their Hearts the weighty Concernments of GOD's King|dom.</P>
<P>But I am fearful that the Stream runs &s;o &s;trong this way, that no Endeavours will work a Publick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ormation; until GOD does give Men another Spirit; or lay them under other Di&s;pen&s;ations. Yet it may not be without good Effect on &s;ome particular Per&s;ons, if a Te&s;ti|mony be born again&s;t the <HI>Practice;</HI> if not to <HI>Reduce</HI> any; yet to <HI>Pre|vent</HI> &s;ome that were in danger.</P>
<P>Thus Sir, I have endeavoured to give &s;ome Satisfaction to your De&s;ires; which I hope you will take in good part, from your Servant.</P>

<P>Q. V. <HI>WHAT Night doth belong to the Sabbath?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> THE Night before the Sabbath-day. The&s;e two Con&s;idera|tions clear it.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT from the Beginning, the Sabbath began in the Evening. That Text, <HI>Lev.</HI> 23.32.&mdash; <HI>From evening to evening, ye &s;hall celebrate your Sabbath,</HI> doth immediately re&s;pect the day of Expiation; but that is to be kept as a Sabbath; from evening, to evening. But this doth further evidence it, becau&s;e the Fir&s;t Sabbath began in the evening. When the Evening and the Morning had made the Sixth Day: as &s;oon as the Sixth day was pa&s;t, the Sabbath began: and &s;o it continued,
<PB N="8" REF="002387_0008_0FDB35174F750030">during the Time of the Old Te&s;tament. And if the Chri&s;tian Sabbath began in the Morning, the &s;eventh part of time is not kept.</P>
<P N="2">2. THO' the Re&s;urrection of CHRIST made a change of the day; yet there is no rea&s;on that the Time of the day when He ro&s;e, &s;hould make a change of the Time of the day wherein the Sabbath &s;hould begin.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) BECAUSE the Scripture doth not a&s;&s;ure us in what exact Time CHRIST ro&s;e: if GOD had appointed that we &s;hould begin the Sab|bath then, He would have given us light to know when that Time was: for the Scripture is a perfect Rule. But none of the Pen-men do de&s;ign to tell us the Exact Time when CHRIST Ro&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) IT is not the manner of Men, when Solemnities are kept in Memory of &s;ome great thing that hapned on &s;uch a day, to have a re|gard to the Time of the day; as in keeping Princes Birth-days. So among the <HI>Jews,</HI> they had no regard as to the Circumci&s;ing of their Children, to the Time of day when they were born. If a Child were born on the Sabb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th, an hour <HI>before</HI> Sun-&s;et, it might be Circumci&s;ed the next Sahbath an hour <HI>after</HI> Sun-ri&s;e, when it was not compleatly &s;even days old.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) WE have no rea&s;on to think that in the fir&s;t In&s;titution of the Sabbath, GOD had a re&s;pect to the very Moment of Time when He cea&s;ed from the Work of Creation. The Woman was the la&s;t Creature that was made on the Sixth day; but we have no ground to think that She was made the la&s;t hour of that day. The &s;ixth day was a working day: but we have no rea&s;on to think, that GOD was creating all that day.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>AT what Time of the Evening doth the Sabbath begin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> JUST at Sun-&s;et. There be &s;ome in this Country that be|gin the Sabbath in the dusk of the Evening, when the Darkne&s;s pre|vails over the Light. They ground their Opinion on that Scripture, Neh. 13.19. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s when the gates of Jeru&s;alem began to be dark</HI> before <HI>the Sabbath, I commanded that the gates &s;hould be &s;hut, &amp;c.</HI> But this place doth not prove their Opinion; For the word in the Origi|nal is, <HI>When the gates of Jeru&s;alem begar to be &s;haded;</HI> which might be &s;ome con&s;iderable time before the Sabbath; <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> being compa&s;&s;ed with Mountains.</P>

But &s;uch things are &s;eldom puni&s;hed, for want of information.

But many times there is a fame of &s;uch things, but &s;eldom Complaint is made to Authority. Po&s;&s;ibly, &s;ome Per&s;ons are obnoxious them&s;elves, and are afraid that if they bring out others, that they &s;hall be brought out.</P>
<P>BUT the great Rea&s;on of this is the want of a Spirit of Religion: Men are not concerned for the Honour of GOD, the preventing of Judgments, and the Recovery of their Brethren.

Q. VH. <HI>IS not the neglect of bringing others to the Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, a Provocation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> IT mu&s;t needs be. It was foretold of CHRIST, that <HI>all nations &s;hall call him ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> P&s;al. 72.7. <HI>GOD promi&s;ed to Him that He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> give Him the Heathen for his luberitance,</HI> P&s;al. 2.8. And it is a part of that Love and Duty which we owe to JESUS CHRIST, and to the Souls of Men, as we have opportunity, to be prevailing with other Peo|ple to give entertainment to the Go&s;pel. Great pains were taken that way in the fir&s;t Ages of Chri&s;tianity, and with great Succe&s;s: But there is great rea&s;on to fear, that we have not an&s;wered GOD's expecla|tion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay.</P>
<P N="1">1. THERE has been a neglect of bringing &s;ome of our own Nation to the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel. Many in, and about <HI>Rhode I&s;land,</HI> and in the <HI>Naragan&s;et</HI>-Country, have fallen into Here&s;y; and &s;ome almo&s;t into Heatheni&s;m. And we have been too much unconcerned about re|ducing them unto the Right way: We have rea&s;on to reflect on tho&s;e Words to the Shepherds of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Ezek. 34.4. <HI>The di&s;ea&s;ed have ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;trengthned, neuber have ye bealed that which was &s;ick; neither have ye bound up that which was broken; neither have ye brought again that which was driven away; neither have ye &s;ought that which was left.</HI> There has been &s;omething done of late Years, at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e-I&s;land</HI> &amp; the places adju|cent; and it has not been without Effect. But it was too long before it was taken in hand, and has not been followed with &s;ufficient Applica|tion: If we had done much more, it would have been more Acceptable to GOD. When the Kingdom of CHRIST doth not flouri&s;h, Satan's Kingdom will prevail. Our Diligence might have prevented the growth of Athei&s;m and Prophanene&s;s, and have pre&s;erved many from falling in with the Apo&s;tacy.</P>
<P N="2">2. THERE has been a neglect to bring the <HI>Indians</HI> to the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel. Something has been done through the Piety of particu|lar Men; and at the Co&s;t of &s;ome in <HI>Old England;</HI> But we are reproach|ed abroad for our Negligence. Many Men have been more carefull to make a Prey of them, then to gain them to the Knowlege of CHRIST. The King in the CHARTER &s;ays, that the Undertakens did profe&s;s it to be their principal de&s;ign to bring the Natives to the Knowledge of GOD. But we have very much failed of pro&s;ecuting that De&s;ign to Effect. We mu&s;t bring them to Civility and to learn our Language. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays to
<PB N="12" REF="002387_0012_0FDB3521F687F218">the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> I <HI>&s;eek not yours but you,</HI> 2 Cor. 12.14. The Rever&s;e is too true of <HI>New-England.</HI> It may be, on that account GOD hath made them to be a &s;courge to us. GOD &s;ays to <HI>Ecekiel, Thou art not &s;ent to a people of a &s;trange &s;peech, and of an hard language &mdash; Surely had I &s;ent thee to them, they would have bearkned unto thee,</HI> Ezek. 3.5, 6. We have rea&s;on to fear, that we are much to blame for their continu|ance in their Heatheni&s;m.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE have Neglected to bring <HI>Servants</HI> to the Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion. Some Men are careful to make their Servants learn their Catechi&s;m, to make them attend Family, and Publick Wor&s;hip. But Servants &s;hould be brought to the Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion; they need to practi&s;e Religion, as well as their Ma&s;ters; and their Ma&s;ters are bound to take care of their <HI>Souls</HI> as well as their <HI>Bodies.</HI> GOD required <HI>Abraham</HI> to circum|ci&s;e his <HI>Servants,</HI> as well as his <HI>Children,</HI> Gen. 17.12, 13. Here you may ob&s;erve two things. 1. GOD &s;ays, <HI>They mu&s;t needs be circumci&s;ed.</HI> 2. GOD makes this to be a Token of his Covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> &amp; his Po&s;terity. If they had proper Helps, they might be as forward in Religion, as the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> It has been the mi&s;ery of <HI>New-England,</HI> that under a fear of polluting the Ordinances; they have neglected pro|per means to make Men godly.</P>
<P>Q VIII. <HI>DID we any wrong to the</HI> Indians <HI>in buying their Land at a &s;mall price?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1. THERE was &s;ome part of the Land that was not purcha&s;ed, neither was there need that it &s;hould; it was <HI>vacuum domicilium;</HI> and &s;o might be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by virtue of GOD's grant to Mankind, Gen. 1.28. <HI>And God ble&s;&s;ed them, and God &s;aid unto them, Be fruitful and multiply and repleni&s;h the earth, and &s;ubdue it: and have dominion over the fi&s;h of the &s;ea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> made no u&s;e of it, but for Hunting. By GOD's fir&s;t Grant Men were to &s;ubdue the Earth.
