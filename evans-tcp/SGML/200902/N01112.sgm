<P><HI>There are many Sinful Plea&s;ures, in which Young People are prone to Indulge them|&s;elves.</HI> The very Foundation of our Na|ture is laid in Corruption, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.5.

And does not the Pride and Ma|lice of their hearts appear, in the words and actions even of Sucking Babes?</P>
<P>The&s;e Early Fruits of <HI>Pride, Malice, En|vy, Revenge, &amp;c.</HI> are Actual Sins, tho' of Ignorance. And if they are not again&s;t Light, yet neither are they for want of Light; for we find by &s;ad Experience, that as &s;oon as the light begins to di&s;cover mo|ral Good &amp; Evil, it does rather irritate the Corruptions of the heart, and inflame their De&s;ires after forbidden Fruit, than bear down and overcome them. Indeed, the early in&s;tructions and re&s;traints of Godly Parents, have no &s;mall influence on &s;ome Children; not only to prevent the out-breaking of much Evil, but al&s;o to the &s;ea|&s;oning of their Hearts with Grace betimes. Yet how many are there that break all bands &amp; bounds, taking their &s;winge in all kinds of <HI>Youthful Vanities!</HI> Who as they in|crea&s;e in Dayes &amp; Years, go on from one &s;inful Plea&s;ure to another; and many, ma|ny are the wicked Practices that Corrupt

<P><HI>For all the&s;e Youthful Vanities, God will call Young People to an Account.</HI> When God at fir&s;t made man, He gave him a Law, to be the Rule of his Life; annexing Promi|&s;es and Threatnings to that Holy, Righte|ous &amp; Good Law. And tho' by our Apo&s;ta&s;y, we have rendred our &s;elves unable to keep the Law of God; yet, tis neverthele&s;s bind|ing; e&s;pecially to them who have it not only written on their Hearts, as even the Heathen are &s;aid to have, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2 14, 15 but more fully, and le&s;s darkly in their Bi|bles; with the addition of the Go&s;pel, by which the Law is E&s;tabli&s;hed, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.31.

<HEAD>PROPOSITION III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>This is a Truth which GOD would have Young People to Know.</HI> Young Men <HI>Re|joyce in their Youth,</HI> as if they were made for nothing but Merriment; and their <HI>Hearts Chear them in the Days of their Youth,</HI> ju&s;t as if it were alwayes to be Spring-time with them. They can Read, and Medi|tate on the former part of our Text with Delight. How plea&s;ing is the Coun&s;el, in the &s;en&s;e their wanton Hearts would have it taken in? Words could &s;carce fit them better. <HI>Walk in the ways of thine Heart, &amp; in the &s;ight of thine Eyes:</HI> This is what they would have!

They mu&s;t take this &s;tinging <HI>B&V;T</HI> with the re&s;t; <HI>Know thou, that for all the&s;e things, God will bring thee into Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>For the further Illu&s;tration of this Third <HI>Propo&s;ition,</HI> it may be Enquired, What it is for Young Men to Know this Truth? Why God would have them to know it And,
<PB N="11" REF="001324_0014_0FB27ED9107C0438">
Whence it is that they are &s;o Unwilling to Know it?</P>
<P>Que&s;t I. <HI>What is it for Young Men to Know this Great Truth?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w. In Gen.</HI> It is more than barely to Know that &s;uch a Truth is written in their Bibles: It is to Realize the Truth of it, and to Think much upon it. Yea, it is to Know (as the word in Scripture, frequent|ly &s;ignifies,) &s;o as to be <HI>Affected</HI> with it &amp; to act accordingly. For Vain Youth to Know, that for all the&s;e things they mu&s;t come to Judgment, in the &s;en&s;e of our <HI>Text,</HI> is for them to Know it, not only Notionally, with a Speculative, Barren, Unpractical Know|ledge; but Feelingly, with a Knowledge that is Heart-affecting and Operative.</P>
<P>More Particularly.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>For Young Men to Know aright, is for them firmly to Believe the Truth of this. All-concerning Doctrine, of a Judgment to come.</HI> To Realize it to them&s;elves, that they mu&s;t certainly, and may quickly Dye: For God often &s;hortens the dayes of them who are <HI>Wicked Overmuch,</HI> and <HI>Fooli&s;h, Eccl</HI> 7.17&punc; Tho&s;e who indulge them&s;elves in Youthful Lu&s;ts often Dye in Youth, <HI>Job</HI> 36.14. And <HI>after Death comes the Judgment,</HI> Heb 9.27. To Know aright, is to Believe all this; and
<PB N="12" REF="001324_0015_0FB27EDDC62420D8">
further, to Realize the Second Coming of Chri&s;t to Judgment; when <HI>He &s;hall De&s;cend from Heaven, with a Shout, with the Voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the Trump of God;</HI> who&s;e Voice &s;hall Rai&s;e the Dead, 1 <HI>The&s;</HI> 4.16. And that when <HI>He comes with Clouds, E|very Eye &s;hall &s;ee Him; and tho&s;e al&s;o who Pierced Him;</HI> &mdash; (Have not Young men done &s;o by their Sins?) <HI>And all the Kindreds of the Earth &s;hall wail becau&s;e of Him,</HI> Rev. 1.7 Neither &s;hall &s;o much as one Proud, Un|cha&s;t, Di&s;obedient, or Vain Thought, Word or Action, e&s;cape Unaccounted for, in that Day of Reckoning. Thus to Know is mote than to Hear and Read the&s;e things; It is to Believe and Realize them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>For Young Men to Know this Truth, as they &s;hould, is for them with frequency and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of Soul, to Con&s;ider of it.</HI> It's not enough to Believe, that, if we indulge our &s;elves in Sin, God will Judge and Condemn us for our Sins; but we mu&s;t take it into &s;olemn Con&s;ideration: If it be an Article of our <HI>Faith,</HI> it mu&s;t be the Subject of our <HI>Meditation.</HI> We &s;hould be often thinking of, and with the greate&s;t &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s Re|volving in our minds, this Eternal Con|cern of our Souls. Hence we find Know|ing and Con&s;idering frequently joyned to|gether
<PB N="13" REF="001324_0016_0FB27EDF43B12508">
in Scripture; Thus, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 25.17: and I&s;a. 1.3. <HI>I&s;rael does not Know. My Peo|ple do not Con&s;ider.</HI> Not to Con&s;ider of this Truth, is not to Know it aright. Again, I&s;a. 41.20. <HI>That they may See, and Know, &amp; Con&s;ider.</HI> So that when God bids Young Men Know, what the Latter End of a Vain Life will be, He would have them to take it into mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;ideration: And it will be their wi&s;dom &s;o to do, Deut. 32.29. <HI>O that they were Wi&s;e; that they &V;n|der&s;tood this; that they would Con&s;ider their Latter End!</HI> And not only to Con&s;ider what it &s;hall be; but withal to think how they &s;hall be able to hold up their heads in that Day! What they &s;hall have to &s;ay for them&s;elves! How they can bear to hear (and yet hear they mu&s;t) that dreadful Sentence, <HI>Go ye Cur&s;ed into Everla&s;ting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI> And further, to con&s;ider what it will be to lie in Hell among Devils, and Damned Men and Women for ever! And thus to con|&s;ider would affect their Hearts; which al&s;o is included in Knowing aright. But this brings us to the Third Particular, under the Fir&s;t Enquiry.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>For Young Men to Know the Great Truth before us in the &s;en&s;e of our Text, is for them
<PB N="14" REF="001324_0017_0FB27EE0C1A07160">
to be deeply Affected with it, and Concerned a|bout it. To Know,</HI> is in this &s;en&s;e al&s;o fre|quently taken in Scripture: Thus, 1 King. 8.38 Job 13.23. <HI>Make me to Know my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and my Sin.</HI> And yet nearer to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, does that fervent Prayer of Holy <HI>David</HI> &s;eem to be, P&s;al. 39.4. <HI>Make me to Know mine End,</HI> i. e. &s;o as to lay it to heart. It was an Affectionate Know|ledge that he there de&s;ired. So Ezek 16 2. <HI>Cau&s;e Jeru&s;alem to Know her Abominations.</HI> God would have her to lay to Heart her Sins; to be deeply Affected with them, and Sorrowful for them, when he &s;peaks of her Knowing them. So that, <HI>Know thou, &amp;c.</HI> in our Text, is as much as if God had &s;aid, And wilt thou indeed, Vain, Fooli&s;h Young Man? &mdash; Art thou re&s;olved to wallow in the mire of Sin? Then I would have thee to <HI>Know,</HI> by Believing and Con&s;idering, &mdash; Yea, let it &s;ink into thy Heart, and fill thy Soul with trembling, that I will mo&s;t &s;ure|ly, and &s;hortly too, call thee to a mo&s;t &s;trict and &s;olemn Account, for all thy <HI>Youthful Vanities;</HI> and thou &s;halt find them to be Dear bought Plea&s;ures: &mdash; And if Young Men did know this Great Truth thus <HI>Af|fectionately,</HI> they would &s;oon come to know it <HI>Practically</HI> which is the Fourth &amp; La&s;t

Who never did nor will He, <HI>in any wi&s;e ca&s;t out &s;uch as do come,</HI> Joh. 6 37 Then the Poor, Convinced, Trembling Sinner, is Enabled by the mighty Power of God (even the Exceeding Greatne&s;s of that Power where|by Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed from the Dead, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.19) to con&s;ent that Chri&s;t &s;hall be his Saviour, and to accept of Him on his own Terms: And this is true Faith, Joh. 1.12. <HI>Put to as many as Received Him, to them gave <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to become the Sons of God; even to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that Believed on His Name.</HI> And this is Practically to Know the Great Truth contained in our Text; and when we come thus to Know it, we Know it as God would have us to do; who&s;e very end in laying before us the danger of tho&s;e Sin|ful Ways in which we have been walk|ing, is to drive us to Chri&s;t, by whom a|lone we may E&s;cape that danger.

<P N="2">2. <HI>The Next thing included in a Practical Knowledge of the Truth before us, is Repentance.</HI> This Grace never fails to follow or rather to accompany Saving Faith But to imagine that Godly Sorrow for Sin goes before Faith, is the dangerous mi&s;take of many poor Souls, who think they mu&s;t mourn for &s;in

to fit them for Chri&s;t; and when they think they have &s;o done, they hope Chri&s;t will accept of them; and to Him they go; (if it might be called going to Chri&s;t;) but with the Young Man in the Go&s;pel, <HI>too full of them&s;elves to have any room left for Je&s;us Christ,</HI> Mat. 19.20. Its true, a Soul mu&s;t be Humbled before it can Believe, but that Humiliation which goes before Faith, has not a drop of Godly Sorrow for Sin in it. No, it con&s;i&s;ts rather in the &s;en&s;e of an hard Heart, that can't mourn for Sin; yea, that is empty of all Good, and full of nothing but Sin; unworthy of the lea&s;t crumb of Mercy, &s;o much as to be &s;tayed from going down to the Pit for one &s;ingle Day. So that the Humbled Soul comes to acknowledge, (and how Evident is it?) that nothing but Free Grace can help it. Yea, after all its Sighs &amp; Groans, and ear|ne&s;t Cries for Mercy, if God &s;hould kick it away from His Foot&s;tool (where it lies pro&s;trate, with its mouth in the Du&s;t) into the Bottomle&s;s Pit, yet God is Righteous! This is that Humiliation which goes be|fore Faith: But brokenne&s;s of Heart for Sin follows after: To our &s;en&s;e, feeling &amp; ob&s;ervation it does &s;o; tho' it does really accompany faith, being infu&s;ed with it

into the Penitent Believing Soul. Thus tis a &s;en&s;e of the Love of God in Chri&s;t to a mo&s;t vile, wretched Sinner, that breaks the Heart, fills it with &s;hame and &s;orrow; yea quite melts it down into Penitential Tears, which now at the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the Everla&s;ting Love of GOD, the Father of Mercies, thro' a &s;weet JESUS, do flow free|ly from that newly Created Principle of Life in the Soul, as Waters from a Living Spring. Search the Scriptures, and &s;ee if it be not &s;o? Ezek. 16 63. <HI>That thou maye&s;t Remember and be Confounded, and never Open thy mouth any more becau&s;e of thy &s;hame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou ha&s;t done, &s;aith the Lord God.</HI> Mark the Con|vexion; <HI>Then a&s;hamed, when I am pacified.</HI> You know that without (or, which is all one, before) Faith, it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God, (<HI>Heb</HI> 11.6) by Repentance or any act of Obedience: But being United to Chri&s;t by Faith, the Soul derives Vertue &amp; Strength from the full Fountain of Life, to mourn for Sin, even all Sin, as the greate&s;t Evil; as again&s;t GOD and CHRIST. Oh, that ever I &s;hould offend &amp; grieve a GOD &s;o Good, whom I now &s;ee to be my Loving Friend &amp; Father in Chri&s;t! And He Loved me, while I was polluted in my Blood&punc; and

And all this after He had Loved me, and Dyed for me, that He might wa&s;h me from my Sins in His own Blood! Thus the Soul melts, when Chri&s;t &s;peaks Peace, by the &s;weet &s;till Voice of His Spirit. And this is true Repentance, taken in a more re&s;trained &s;en&s;e; for largely taken it includes New Obedience; and Faith al&s;o is nece&s;&s;arily implied in it: But we are &s;peaking of the&s;e Graces di&s;tinctly; and New Obedi|ence is the Third and La&s;t thing compre|hended in this Practical Knowledge.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Saving Faith, &amp; that Repentance which is unto Life, will be fruitful in Good Works.</HI> The Soul that has ta&s;ted the bitterne&s;s of Sin, cannot now drink in Iniquity like Wa|ter, as heretofore it has done.

Yet others won't take warning. Thus, you &s;ee Satan is not the only De&s;troyer of men! They prove, as it were, Devils to one a|nother. It is much thro' the Evil Exam|ples &amp; Per&s;wa&s;ions of Companions in Sin that this truth is unknown, unthought of.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It is partly al&s;o, yea principally from them|&s;elves, that Young Per&s;ons come &s;hort of their Duty, while they ru&s;h into Sin.</HI> The hearts of Vain Youths are naturally full of Enmity again&s;t God, and therefore cannot be &s;ub|ject to His Law, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8 7.
