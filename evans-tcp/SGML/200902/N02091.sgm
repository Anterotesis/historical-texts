<P><HI>PETER</HI> tells us that in <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Epi&s;tles there be &s;ame things that are hard to be Under&s;tood,</HI> and this ver&s;e and three following may well be accounted of that number. There are two Interpreta|tions of this Text and Context, ari&s;ing from the differing Ex|po&s;ition that is given of the word <HI>Creature.</HI> Some by creature do under&s;tand the frame of the vi&s;ible World, con&s;i&s;ting of the <HI>Cele&s;tial,</HI> and <HI>Elementary</HI> Regions, the <HI>Heavens</HI> with the goodly furniture of Stars, and the <HI>Earth</HI> with its ornaments, and the other Elements. And &s;o they &s;ay that the creature; do by a fixed In&s;tinct de&s;ire that original perfection wherein they were created which &s;hall be re&s;tored to them at the Time of the manife&s;tation of the Sons of God; that is, at the day of Judgment: it follows, <HI>v.</HI> 20. <HI>For the creature was made &s;ubject to vanity not willingly, but by rea&s;on of him who hath &s;ubjected the &s;ome in hope.</HI> The Earth is under a cur&s;e, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.17. and the Hea|vens by their influence do infect the Air: the creatures are &s;ubject

The&s;e promi&s;es were abundantly fulfilled, as we have an account in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles and in Epi&s;tles written to &s;everal Churches of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> This was repre&s;ented, <HI>Rev.</HI> 6.2.

So God promi&s;ed it to Chri&s;t, as the reward of his Service; the Service that God called him to, was very great, it was a mighty un|dertaking to lay down his life for Sinners; for the Beloved Son of God to bear the wrath of God! And God promi&s;ed a large Kingdom as the reward of that Service. I&s;a. 33.12. <HI>Therefore will I divide him a por|tion with the great, and he &s;hall divide the &s;pent with the &s;tren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: becau&s;e be poured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t his &s;oul unto death.</HI> I&s;a 49.6. <HI>It is a light thing with me that thou &s;houldst be my &s;ervant to rai&s;e up the tribes of Jacob, &amp; to re&s;tore the pre&s;erved of I&s;rael: I will al&s;o give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> may&s;t be my &s;alvation unto the end of the earth.</HI> And long before, He made a promi&s;e by <HI>Noah,</HI> Gen. 9.27. <HI>God &s;hall enlarge Jap et, and he &s;hall dwell in the tents of She<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">;</HI> he &s;hall be incorporated with the Church.

<P N="2">2. It was much for the <HI>Honour</HI> of Chri&s;t. God has made him a <HI>King</HI> as well as a <HI>Prophet</HI> and a <HI>Priest,</HI> and will give a great Kingdom to him. The Honour of a King is in the multitude of his Subjects, and for his Honour he &s;hall be King of Nations.

2. <HI>It was very much that One Nation &s;hould not ingro&s;s the Mercy of GOD.</HI> God's Mercy is his <HI>Own,</HI> and He has the liberty to be&s;tow it where he plea&s;es: but there &s;eems to be a condecency in it that He &s;hould offer this Grace to all Nations.

<P>USE. I Of Warning. <HI>That you dont reject the Go&s;pel.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> re|jected it, and God gave it to other People that brought forth the fruit of it. Now we have the Opportunity, God offers the Go&s;pel to our Nation and unto this Generation; this will be a foundation of eternal Life, if we dont reject it. Let it be your care to receive it: &s;ome People have not the offer of it. Do not as the <HI>Jews</HI> did!</P>
<P>There were two things that made them reject it,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A &s;pirit of Slumber.</HI> They enjoyed a great deal of ea&s;e and out|ward Pro&s;perity, and fell into a &s;lumbering condition, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.8. they wanted to be awakened to <HI>work out their &s;alvation with fear and trembling:</HI> they &s;et their hearts upon the World, Mat. 22.5. <HI>One had bought a piece of ground, and another had bought five yoke of Oxen, and they mu&s;t be excu&s;ed,</HI> Luk. 14.18, 19. A woldly &s;pirit will ruine many men; the rever&s;e to this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of many, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.18. The love of the world be&s;ots many; they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> like to get but little of the world, yet they loo&s;e their Souls for the &s;ake of it: The &s;eed of the Go&s;pel is choked with the care of the world, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.22. Worldly affections eat out their Religion. They &s;ay, <HI>It is good to be here;</HI> they do it <HI>&s;eek that City that is to come.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They were Blinded.</HI> Rom. 11.7. be&s;ides their natural blindne&s;s, <HI>they had a vail upon their bearts,</HI> that was the law; they thought that would &s;ave them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.3. They <HI>went about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> they drunk in a conceit that that would do. They thought they did not need the Blood of a Redeemer, they thought the blood of Sacrifices would &s;erve the turn: &s;o, many among us are blinded with a proud conceit of their own excellency; their eyes are fixed upon that, they dont &s;ee their need of Chri&s;t, they dont &s;ee the glory of Chri&s;t. An hundred Arguments wont convince them;
<PB N="6" REF="002479_0006_0FDB65C3ABFC7F80">&s;ay what you will to them, they think they mu&s;t have &s;omething to commend them: they are &s;trangers to the Freere&s;s of God's Grace, and they are wa&s;hing of them&s;elves to make them&s;elves clean, and they are adorning of them to make them&s;elves fine &amp; beautiful; You cant beat them out of conceit of them&s;elves. They <HI>think they are &s;ome|thing when they are nothing,</HI> Gal. 6.3. They pri&s;e their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and that is an hindrance, to their pri&s;ing of <HI>CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>USE, II. Of Examination. <HI>Whether GOD is not Angry with the Country for not preaching the Go&s;pel to the Heathen?</HI> That GOD is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with the Country, and has been the&s;e three&s;core years, has been evident by His &s;ending <HI>Epidemical Di&s;ca&s;es</HI> and <HI>Devourers;</HI> And it greatly becomes us to enquire into the Cau&s;es of God's Anger: ma|ny things index are &s;atisfyed in are the cau&s;e of Anger: if God is not angry for this; yet there is cau&s;e enough of Anger. But we have &s;pe|cial Rea&s;on to enquire whether he is not angry for this; becau&s;e it is taken notice of in <HI>England,</HI> and we are reflected on in Print, that we have little care of the Heathen; it was miles notice of above Forty Years ago. Another creation for enquiry i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

They are in&s;truments to puni&s;h us, it may be we have not done our duty to them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>CHRIST Commands us to Preach the Go&s;pel to them.</HI> The Country is not le&s;t at liberty, whether they will cau&s;e the Go&s;pel to be preached unto them; it is not a matter of indifference, whether they will do it, or neglect it. I readily acknowledge that the <HI>Indians</HI> have &s;hewed a very br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ti&s;h and &s;etti&s;h &s;pirit; that where a people lived among them that made a great profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, they did not enquire into it whether the Doctrine that they profe&s;&s;ed was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, or not. They plainly manife&s;ted that they had very much of litera|ted the light of Nature: and made no tolerable u&s;e of their natural Con&s;cience, that taught them that there was a glorious GOD, that made the World, that was to be wor&s;hipped and &s;erved; and that their Souls were Immortal.

And when the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Princes had Subdned the <HI>Ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ites,</HI> they Compelled them to be Circumci&s;ed, and to make a Profe&s;&s;ion of the true God.

David rejoyced in that <HI>Men &s;hould abundantly utter the memory of his great goodne&s;s; and &s;ing of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> P&s;al. 145.7. And if a Spirit of Love to Je&s;us Chri&s;t had flouri&s;hed in us, it would be the Joy of our Hearts, to &s;ee Congregations of <HI>Indians</HI> waiting on God in his Hou&s;e, joyning in Prayer, and hearing the Go&s;pel, and Celebrating the Memory of the Death of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We ought to have done it out of Love to Mankind.</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us Died For the Saltation of Sinners, and it is a great thing <HI>to Save a Soul from Death,</HI> Jam. 5.20. It is matter of Humbling to think of the Damnation of Men, and to &s;ee Men go Ignorantly on in a way of De&s;truction. Our Hearts &s;hould yearn towards the&s;e Poor Heathen; it becomes us to Commi&s;erate their Condition. It is a doleful thing to think, that from generation to generation, they go down to Hell. We know that none is able to bear it, to <HI>dwell with dev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring Fire, To dweil with ever|la&s;ting Burnings.</HI> And we &s;hould not think much of it, to be at &s;ome Expence for to Redeem Men from De&s;tru&s;tion. It is very great kindne&s;s to help Men to Heaven. It will be as intolerable for the&s;e Heathen to bear the Torments of Hell, as for any of us to bear them. And as we dread to go to Hell our &s;elves, it &s;hould be awful to us to con&s;ider their Damnation. Love and Pity calls for it, that we &s;hould help them out of their Danger. We &s;hould pity <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> in Mi&s;ery, much more <HI>Men:</HI> Tho they be Bruti&s;h Per&s;ons; yet, they are of Mankind, and &s;o objects of Compa&s;&s;ion. It is an act of Love to our own nature to &s;eek their Salvation: If we can further that, we &s;hall do them great Service.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Profe&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e that Adventured into this Country was, that it was their principal de&s;ign, to bring the</HI> Indians <HI>to the knowlege of the true God and Saviour of Mankind, and the Chri&s;tian Faith;</HI> as the King declares in the Charter: The like is expre&s;&s;ed in the Charter for <HI>Connections.</HI> And it would have been the Honour of the Country, if they had an&s;wered that Profe&s;&s;ion. Indeed we gave the Heathen an Example; and if they had not been mi&s;erably be&s;otted, they would have taken more notice of it. But we have done very little to An&s;wer our Pro|fe&s;&s;ion. Some few pious per&s;ons, of their own accord, have taken &s;ome Pains, and had &s;ome Succe&s;s. And &s;ome Money that has been
<PB N="9" REF="002479_0009_0FDB65C85515CBF0">contributed in <HI>England</HI> for the furtherance of that De&s;ign, has been faithfully expended that way: But the Country has been at very lit|tle Co&s;t for the Conver&s;ion of the Heathen. Many Men have been more careful to make a booty of them, than to gain them to the practice of Religion. It puts me to a &s;tand to conjecture what Excu&s;e can be made for this Neglect. The Poverty of the Country will be no Apology for this Omi&s;&s;ion. We have great cau&s;e to be humbled, that we have an&s;wered our profe&s;&s;ion &s;o poorly.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>We our &s;elves have been pitied, when we were in the like condition.</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation was formerly under heatheni&s;h darkne&s;s, as the&s;e <HI>Indians;</HI> they wor&s;hipped &s;everal Idols, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, Woden, Thor</HI> and <HI>Frea.</HI> But there were tho&s;e that pitied them, and brought the Go&s;pel among them;

Hereby God has laid a foundation for the Salva|tion of many Thou&s;ands of Souls; and God has rai&s;ed up many Men that have been the glory of the Nation, and many that have &s;uffered Martyrdom for the Faith of the Go&s;pel. And what ever Declen&s;ions there be at the pre&s;ent; yet the Go&s;pel is profe&s;&s;ed, and there is great Opportunity to come to Eternal Life. We &s;hould have been &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this Mercy of God to us, as to pity the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> not know|ing but that God may have glorious Churches among them, and that in length of time, many of their Po&s;terity may be glorious Witne&s;&s;es unto Chri&s;t, and that His Kingdom may flouri&s;h among them.</P>

<PB N="10" REF="002479_0010_0FDB65CDDD982FE8">Bible is Printed in their own Language; great Contributions are &s;ent over to advance that Work; and the Name of Chri&s;t i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> renowned among them; and the people that have been in Darkne&s;s have &s;een great Light.

<P N="7">7. <HI>The Activity of Papi&s;ts for the &s;preading of their Religion, may greatly a&s;hame us.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> have done a great deal to bring the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Mexico</HI> to their Religion: And the <HI>Portagueze.</HI> to bring the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Brazil,</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> to theirs. And the <HI>French,</HI> are diligent in <HI>Canada,</HI> and el&s;e where, to go&s;pellize them. And do we fit &s;till, without any hearty Endeavours for the Salvation of the Heathen among us? It may be &s;aid, they do them little &s;ervice to bring them from one error to another; to take them out of the <HI>Pit.</HI> and lead them into a <HI>Snare.</HI> But however, they therein make Con|&s;cience to advance their own Religion; run great Ventures, and en|dare many Hard&s;hips, in order to it. And is it not a Shame to us to be backward to promote the true Religion? If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Zeal, and Prid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and vain glory, have a mighty influence upon them; it might be ex|pected that Love to God, and the Souls of Men, &s;hould &s;tir up us to Propagate the Truth. We have abundantly more Rea&s;on to lay out our &s;elves for the Truth; than others have, for their Errors and Su|per&s;titious doctrines.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>If they &s;hould imbrace Religion, it would be a means to make them live more comfortably in this World.</HI> It is ob&s;ervable, that many Na|tions, when they were in their Heatheni&s;m, lived mi&s;erably as to this World. So the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> and others; But &s;ince their imbracing the Go&s;pel, they are got into a flouri&s;hing condition. God leads them in ways of wi&s;dom, to follow <HI>Husbandry, Trades</HI> and <HI>Merchandize,</HI> and to live honourably and plentifully. They have good Hon&s;es, hand&s;ome Clothing, and comfortable Diet; they live more like Men than they did in former Ages. It is &s;aid Chri&s;t is worthy of <HI>Riches,</HI> Rev. 5.12. God be&s;tows them on Chri&s;t two ways, one is in giving Riches for the maintaining the Ordinances of Chri&s;t; the other is in giving Riches to the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion. And it is very hopeful, if the <HI>Indians</HI> did once imbrace the true

<P N="9">9. <HI>If they &s;hould imbrace Religion, it might provoke us to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> We make an high Profe&s;&s;ion; but yet Religion runs low, and Iniquity doth abound.
