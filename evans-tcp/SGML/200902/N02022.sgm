</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_I MUST humbly make my Apology for a&s;cending the Desk at this time, and entring upon a Service, which I know would be much better per|formed by many of my Fathers and Brethren in the Mini&s;try, in this Place. And this not only for my &s;elf, but for tho&s;e, who have, as it were, broken thro' Order and Superiority, and de&s;cended to &s;o low a Choice, as that of the Per&s;on now addre&s;&s;ing this worthy Audience. Their Excu&s;e and mine is this, That not the Character of a <HI>Divine,</HI> &s;o much as that of a <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> is under our pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration: Not the <HI>Preacher,</HI> but the <HI>Singer</HI> carried the Vote, which laid him under Obligations to comply with their Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE that Ju&s;tice in &s;ome mea&s;ure may be done to the Divine Science of <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> and <HI>Ver&s;e,</HI> I &s;hall have done with Prefaces and Apologies, and as in my poor Man|ner
<PB N="2" REF="002402_0008_0FDB3AACD0607588">I am able, illu&s;trate, confirm and improve the Text under Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t and dying Words of Men u&s;e to be of Weight and Importance with the Survivors; and by them are wont to be e&s;teemed awful and full of Authority. How regard|le&s;s &s;oever we have been of the Sayings of wi&s;e and good Men, while they have been with us; yet that very Cir|cum&s;tance of their <HI>leaving this World,</HI> gives Solemnity and Authority to what they deliver at their Departure out of it. Who knows not, that a Man <HI>a dying</HI> is able to make a greater and deeper Impre&s;&s;ion upon us, than any of the <HI>Living?</HI> For as Time is drawing to a clo&s;e with <HI>them,</HI> &s;o do they &s;peak with a more than humane <HI>Empha&s;is,</HI> and di&s;cover &s;uch an <HI>experimental Air,</HI> as cannot fail to touch the Hearers with the mo&s;t lively and affecting Sen&s;e of what they would communicate to them. As their Mi|nutes are then contracted and grow very precious, &s;o their Di&s;cour&s;e to the Living grows ma&s;&s;y and full, it even fills up Time it &s;elf, admitting no Vacancy of Moments unre|pleni&s;hed with a Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE four Ver&s;es following my Text are worthy to be tran&s;cribed as &s;uch, and may &s;erve as a glorious Introdu|ction to our Di&s;cour&s;e upon the <HI>Sweet P&s;almi&s;t of</HI> I&s;rael; viz. <HI>David</HI>'s Character as a &s;weet Singer, the Honour done him by God in the Record hereof, and the ble&s;&s;ed End a Servant of God, famous for this Skill, may be able to make.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>&s;weet P&s;almist of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>&s;aid</HI> with a more than mortal eloquence&mdash; <HI>The Spirit of the Lord &s;pake by me, and his Word was in my Tongue. The God of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>&s;aid, the Rock of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>&s;pake to me: He that ruleth over Men mu&s;t be just, ruling in the Fear of God; and he &s;hall be as the light of the Morning, when the Sun ri&s;eth, even a Morn|ing without Clouds; as the tender Gra&s;s &s;pringing out of the Earth by clear &s;hining after Rain. Altho' my Hou&s;e be not &s;o with God, yet he hath made with me an everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and &s;ure: For this is all my Salvation and all my De&s;ire, altho' he make it not to grow.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002402_0009_0FDB3AAED2C42B30">
HERE we have verified the Fable of the expiring <HI>Swan</HI> &s;inging her own Elegy; but with this Difference, that our dying P&s;almi&s;t tunes his Voice to Notes of Joy and Triumph, and not to the Keys of Mourning and Sadne&s;s. The&s;e are <HI>David</HI>'s la&s;t Words, this his dying Song, which better than a Monument of Bra&s;s, will con&s;ecrate his deathle&s;s Fame to all Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>who</HI> and <HI>what</HI> was he, that compo&s;ed and &s;ung this divine Song?&mdash; <HI>It was</HI> David <HI>the Son of</HI> Je&s;&s;e, <HI>and the Man who was rai&s;ed up on high, the anointed of the God of</HI> Jacob. Even the Son of a common and inferior Man in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> but exalted to the Regal Dignity and Charge over that great and holy Nation, by the <HI>anoint|ing of the God of</HI> Jacob. The la&s;t Words of &s;o great a Man, and &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed in the Honours conferred upon him by Heaven, mu&s;t command in us the mo&s;t &s;erious Attention and the highe&s;t Regard imaginable. They are the rich Legacy of a dying Prince, and to be received and laid up as an ine&s;timable Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>BUT this is not <HI>all</HI> of the noble Character of <HI>David,</HI> which does thus extort from us a Regard and Reverence to this his concluding Speech and Song. He that &s;pake it, was not only a Godlike Prince, preferred by God him|&s;elf before all the great Per&s;onages of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to the Inheri|tance of the Kingly Power and Honours; but he was THE SWEET PSALMIST OF ISRAEL.</P>
<P>THIS Part of his Character comes under our pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration. Here therefore two Things are to be &s;po|ken to, which will compri&s;e the whole of our pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THE <HI>Character</HI> of holy <HI>David.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THE <HI>Honour</HI> done him in the <HI>Record</HI> of it.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. THE <HI>Character</HI> of holy <HI>David: The &s;weet P&s;almist of</HI> I&s;rael. He was a <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> which Title contains in it two things, namely, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That as a Divine <HI>Poet,</HI> he compo&s;ed Sacred Songs, and Hymns. Our <HI>P&s;alter</HI> is the greate&s;t Part of it, made up of Divine Places of Poe&s;y written by this Man of God, who derived his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> not from <HI>Par|na&s;&s;us,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="002402_0010_0FDB3AB30A8DD010">but from <HI>Zion</HI> the Mount of God. Not the fanci|ed <HI>Mu&s;es</HI> of the Heathen, but the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> dictated his Song; nor needed he a Draught from the muddy Source of <HI>Heli<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">,</HI> who had drank &s;o plentifully of the &s;till and pure Stream (as the almo&s;t Divine <HI>Milton</HI> expre&s;&s;es it) <HI>&s;low|ing fast by the Oracle of God.</HI> Nor were the <HI>Subjects</HI> of <HI>his</HI> Ver&s;e le&s;s Divine, than his <HI>In&s;piration.</HI> Not &s;orry Tri|fles and empty Fables, but the glorious Themes of divine Love, and Wi&s;dom, and Power, and Maje&s;ty; not the im|pure and carnal Conceits of the profane <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> but the ble&s;&s;ed and holy Oracles of JEHOVAH, and the cae|le&s;tial Loves of Chri&s;t and his Church, were &s;ung by him in his immortal Strain. Finally, the <HI>De&s;ign and End</HI> of his <HI>P&s;alms</HI> were con&s;ecrate and pious, even to the great and good Intentions of the Glory of God, and the In&s;tru|ction and Benefit of Men.</P>
<P>BUT then, <HI>Secondly,</HI> The Title of <HI>P&s;almist</HI> carries in it not only that of a <HI>Piet,</HI> but of a <HI>Mu&s;ician</HI> al&s;o. Not only the P&s;alms, but the Tunes to which they were to be &s;et and &s;ung, were his. And the be&s;t both of Jewi&s;h and Chri|&s;tian Interpreters and Expo&s;itors do give Countenance to this Conjecture. But be this as it will, that his Skill both in Vocal and In&s;trumental <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> was famous, is al|lowed upon all Hands. Whether or no he compo&s;ed the Tunes, as well as the P&s;alms, which he frequently &s;ent to the <HI>Pracentor</HI> or <HI>Chief Mu&s;ician,</HI> with his Orders for hav|ing them &s;ung or played, may admit of &s;ome Di&s;pute. But that he had a thorough Under&s;tanding of this &s;weet and divine Science is a matter pa&s;t all doubt. The <HI>Syriac</HI> and <HI>Arabic</HI> Ver&s;ions do favour our fir&s;t Conjecture, and do intimate the Improvements he made in this Part of the Divine Service. They render the Words, <HI>Qui &s;uaves red|didit Cantus I&s;raelis;</HI> Who <HI>made the Songs of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>&s;weet.</HI> He rai&s;ed them to a greater Perfection and Sweetne&s;s, than had ever been in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> before. But to put this beyond all Di&s;pute, we are in the Sacred Oracles informed, that <HI>David</HI> did <HI>invent In&s;truments of Mu&s;ic,</HI> which were pro|fanely imitated, and pro&s;tituted to the De&s;igns of De|bauchery, by the wanton <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> in the Days of the 
<PB N="5" REF="002402_0011_0FDB3AB30E7D1F28">Prophet <HI>Amos,</HI> Chap. 6. Ver&s;e 5. <HI>They invent to them&s;elves In&s;truments of Mu&s;ic like</HI> David. We al&s;o read, that he &s;e|parated or &s;et apart to the Services of Vocal and In&s;tru|mental Mu&s;ic, the Sons of <HI>A&s;aph, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">;</HI> appointing to every &s;ingle Mu&s;ician and to each Quire their Parts in the joint Performance of the Melodies and Anthems of the Temple. Whether for the Voice, or for In&s;truments, &s;uch as the Cymbal, P&s;altery, Harp, the loud &s;ounding or Treble Horn; their Di&s;po&s;ition and Appoint|ment was by the King's Order. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 25.1, 1, 6. And this he did, not meerly by Virtue of his Kingly Au|thority, but as he was the <HI>Chief Ma&s;ter</HI> of the Temple-Mu&s;ic, his &s;uperiour Skill therein rendring him the fitte&s;t Per&s;on in all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> for that Office. But of this enough.</P>
<P><HI>DAVID</HI> was the <HI>P&s;almist of</HI> I&s;rael; that is <HI>of the Church of God,</HI> which wears this Name and Title, with which the Patriarch <HI>Jacob</HI> was dignified, when he had wre&s;tled with the Angel of God in Prayer, and overcame: in this glorious In&s;tance becoming the Head and Repre&s;entative of them that <HI>&s;eek the Face of God.</HI> P&s;al. 24.6. He became thenceforward the Father of the Generation of wre&s;tlers in Prayer, the Prince of them that prevail with the Al|mighty God of <HI>Jacob. I&s;rael</HI> is a mo&s;t proper and ju&s;t Ap|pellation of the <HI>Church Militant</HI> on Earth, who thro' holy Violence, &s;trong Faith, and ardent Importunity, maugre all the Oppo&s;ition of Hell and Earth, <HI>take the Kingdom of Heaven by Force.</HI> Math. 11.12. O that in this &s;weet Ex|erci&s;e of <HI>Singing,</HI> as well as the more laborious one of <HI>Prayer,</HI> we might make &s;uch Improvements and Progre&s;s, as to de&s;erve the honourable Name of <HI>I&s;raelites indeed!</HI></P>
<P>FOR the U&s;e and Benefit of the <HI>Church</HI> then did <HI>David</HI> compo&s;e his <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> with <HI>Tunes</HI> adapted to the Subject Matter of them. It is a very profitable and good Note of <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> upon our Text, <HI>Quicquid Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> Doctrin<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> ha|bent, id intelligunt non &s;uum, &s;ed Ecele&s;ix e&s;&s;e. A good Man calls the Gifts and Talents Heaven endows him with, not his own, but the Church's.</HI> With what&s;oever Skill the Father of Lights in&s;tructs us, it is not de&s;igned by God, nor &s;hould it be laid out by us, for our private U&s;e, Profit
<PB N="6" REF="002402_0012_0FDB3AB4D7BDB688">or Glory; but for God and his <HI>Church.</HI> And a faithful Servant of God beholds all his Accompli&s;hments, whether Natural, Moral or Divine, under no other Notion or View, than that of &s;o many Con&s;ecrations to God, or Talents for the Improvement of which he is accountable to him. The Glory and Honour of God, the Good and Edification of the Church, is that to which they are to be ultimately and at all Times referred. And this is here recorded to the everla&s;ting Honour of King <HI>David,</HI> with re&s;pect to his religious Improvement of his extraordinary <HI>Poetical</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;ical</HI> Abilities. Which hints a &s;evere Reproof of the Licentious <HI>Poe&s;y</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> of the pre&s;ent Age.</P>
<P>FINALLY, He was a <HI>SWEET P&s;almist;</HI> in both the former Re&s;pects, even of his <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> and his <HI>Poe&s;y.</HI> And this is what mu&s;t come under a more large and di&s;tinct Con|&s;ideration. We are now therefore to di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Divine Mu&s;ic,</HI> and <HI>Divine Poe&s;y:</HI> The latter relates to the <HI>Sub|ject matter</HI> of the Song, the former to the <HI>Manner and Form</HI> of the Tune, to which it is to be &s;et or &s;ung. Wherefore</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>MUSIC</HI> con&s;idered alone and in it &s;elf, <HI>is a &s;weet and plea&s;ant Science.</HI> The Charms of <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> are a mo&s;t cele|brated Subject among the be&s;t Writers. And they are &s;o various and &s;o &s;weet, that it is equally impo&s;&s;ible to num|ber them, and &s;ufficiently to admire them. There is &s;carce any thing in the whole Creation of God, &s;o wonderful and a&s;toni&s;hing, as the Doctrine of <HI>Sounds</HI> and <HI>Harmony.</HI> We &s;hall attempt a Di&s;cour&s;e of the Sweetne&s;s of Mu&s;ic under the two following Heads.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>MUSIC is in its own Nature &s;weet and plea&s;ant.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>IT is &s;weet and plea&s;ant in the various Effects it pro|duces in the Souls of Men.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. <HI>MUSIC is in its own Nature &s;weet and plea&s;ant.</HI> There is a twofold Sweetne&s;s and Plea&s;ancy of Sounds and Mu|&s;ical Notes, according to the be&s;t Writers. There is, in the <HI>first</HI> Place, a <HI>Natural or Phy&s;ical Sweetne&s;s</HI> in the Notes of Mu&s;ic. When a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> Voice or String of an In&s;trument &s;o equally and ju&s;tly vibrates the Air, as to give forth a Sound agreeable to the Organ of the Ear. Being free
<PB N="7" REF="002402_0013_0FDB3AB62588BFD8">from all Jarr or A&s;perity, it &s;trikes the <HI>Auditory Nerves</HI> in &s;uch Manner as one <HI>Uni&s;on</HI> String percu&s;s'd or &s;trook, cau&s;es the other to &s;hake and tremble. When the external Air is thus vibrated, the &s;ame or a like Vibration is effe|cted in the internal Air repo&s;ited in the Cavity of the Or|gan, and this communicates its even and ju&s;t Motion to the Nerves afore&s;aid. In this Sen&s;e, even the unaffected chirping Notes and &s;mooth Warbles of the very Birds of Heaven, tho&s;e

<P>BUT then <HI>Secondly;</HI> There is a <HI>Mathematical Sweetne&s;s and Plea&s;ancy</HI> in Sounds. This is no other than the Doc|trine of <HI>Concords,</HI> to which there are required more Sounds than one, &s;o proportioned and di&s;tanced in certain Inter|vals, as to create a plea&s;ant <HI>Harmony</HI> and Agreement. The Plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from this <HI>Mathematical Sweetne&s;s</HI> or A|greement of Sounds, is a more <HI>Intellectual</HI> Plea&s;ure; that from the <HI>Phy&s;ical</HI> Sweetne&s;s, a more <HI>Sen&s;ual.</HI> Hence not only <HI>all Men,</HI> but the very <HI>Brutes</HI> too are capable of re|ceiving a Delight in a &s;ingle plea&s;ant Sound or Voice, but <HI>none</HI> of the Brutal Race, nor <HI>all</HI> of the Humane are capa|ble of reli&s;hing the <HI>Melody</HI> ari&s;ing from the harmonious Agreement of a Diver&s;ity of Sounds. This requires a tuneful Soul, as well as a good Ear. As a late Anony|mous Poet well expre&s;&s;es it&mdash;
<Q><L><HI>For Man may justly tuneful Strains admire,</HI></L>
<L><HI>His SOUL is Mu&s;ic, and his Brea&s;t a Lyre.</HI></L>

<P>HERE let it be ob&s;erved, that the <HI>Lowne&s;s</HI> and the <HI>Height</HI> of Sounds in the <HI>Gamut</HI> or Scale of Mu&s;ic, is not cau&s;ed by the Strength and Force, but the <HI>Frequency</HI> of the Percu&s;&s;ions, Strokes, or Tremors of the Air.

BUT let us come to the <HI>Theological</HI> Con&s;ideration of the Point, and &s;hew the ble&s;&s;ed Influence and Effects of Harmo|ny upon the Soul, as it is helpful to Devotion, either to excite, a&s;&s;i&s;t, promote or pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT creates a most He&s;&s;ed Serenity and quiet Calm in the Soul of the Wor&s;hipper.</HI> He that would wor&s;hip God a|right, ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s a quiet Mind, free from the Di&s;|turbance and Agitation of Pa&s;&s;ions. So when the Soul of holy <HI>David</HI> was di&s;quieted in him, he knew not how to apply him&s;elf to the &s;weet Exerci&s;e of Singing in the Tem|ple. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 42.11. and 43.4. His Thoughts within him were tumultuous, and various Pa&s;&s;ions haunted his Brea&s;t, while he was revolving in his Mind the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Enemy, his Ab&s;ence from the Hou&s;e of God, and other afflictive and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Themes; he became hereupon wholly unfit for religious Exerci&s;es. So the <HI>Jews</HI> in the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> Captivity hung their neglected Harps upon the Willows, when they remembred <HI>Zion,</HI> and their once glo|rious and happy State, amid&s;t the In&s;ults of their barba|rous Enemies. Say they, <HI>How &s;hall we &s;ing the Lord's Songs in a &s;trange Land?</HI> P&s;al. 137.4. Which is a &s;ure Proof how driving Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as Anger, Grief, Hatred, Fear, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do ruffle the Soul, and wholly indi&s;po&s;e it to the Exerci&s;es of Religion and Devotion. Any further Proofs from Scripture are needle&s;s. All that I &s;hall Remark up|on the&s;e In&s;tances is this, when they were &s;o unfitted for Devotion, as that they had not the Inclination or Power to play upon their <HI>Harps,</HI> their very Harps, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> they u&s;ed them, would have been their Cure, and have allayed the very Pa&s;&s;ions, which forbad them to play.</P>
<P>LET us now con&s;ider the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">s of <HI>Mu&s;ic;</HI> how do they &s;oothe the Soul to Re&s;t, and reduce it to an heavenly Quietude and Temper! How do they allay the turbid Pa&s;&s;ions, and chace the Di&s;turbers out of our Brea&s;t! <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> has a natural Tendency to this. For as it is capable of being &s;o ordered, as to rai&s;e and increa&s;e tumultuous Pa&s;&s;i|ons in the Soul; &s;o no le&s;s to allay and quiet the&s;e Di&s;|orders. The Story of <HI>Timothous,</HI> who with his Harp chang|ed the Temper of <HI>Alexander,</HI> as often as he plea&s;ed to
<PB N="12" REF="002402_0018_0FDB3AC14A3301F8">change his Notes and Keys; either
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dryden</HI>'s Ode.</NOTE> <HI>to &s;well his Soul to Rage,</HI> or enkindle the &s;ofter Pa&s;&s;ions, or to lull it into a total Calm. The Stories al&s;o of <HI>Pythagoras, A&s;clepiades,</HI> and others mentioned by <HI>Gronovius</HI> and <HI>Kircher,</HI> are a full Proof of the Power of Harmony, either to rai&s;e or to calm the Pa&s;&s;ions. The <HI>Thracian Orpheus</HI> taming wild Bea&s;ts, and di&s;arming them of their Fury, is, if we moralize the <HI>Fable,</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dictus ob hoc lenire Tigres, rabido&s;qe Leones. Hor.

<P>BUT if Mu&s;ic alone can by its natural Force and Charms work the&s;e Effects, what may not <HI>Divine Harmony,</HI> under the Influence and Co-operation of Heaven, be able to pro|duce in the Soul of the Wor&s;hipper! <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 43.3, 4. <HI>Send forth thy Light and thy Truth; let them bring me to thy ho|ly Hill, and to thy Tabernacles.

<P N="2">2. <HI>MUSIC is of good u&s;e to &s;u&s;pend and cure the evil and malign Influences of Satan on the Soul.</HI> Be&s;ides our natural Pa&s;&s;ions, which are oftentimes turbid and trouble&s;ome, and &s;o do unfit the Soul for Devotion, <HI>Satan</HI> may be permitted to interpo&s;e his Agency and Influence, to increa&s;e and heighten the&s;e Di&s;orders of the Mind. When we give way to &s;inful Pa&s;&s;ions, <HI>Satan</HI> finds an ea&s;y Pa&s;&s;age into the Soul. He u&s;ually makes his Entrance thro' a Storm, and like a true hater of Peace and Harmony, takes a malicious and cruel Plea&s;ure, in his Man&s;ion of Di&s;cord and Uproar. Had we not upon Sacred Record the In&s;tance of <HI>Saul,</HI> &amp;c. I believe we need not go very far to &s;eek In&s;tances enough of Per&s;ons agitated and acted by the Furies of Hell.

<P>THUS far he; and this is not the only In&s;tance of the U&s;e of <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> in <HI>Prophe&s;ying;</HI> (which Word, by the Way, is not to be re&s;trained to what we call <HI>Prediction,</HI> or the foretelling future Events by the Revelation of the Spirit of God, but compri&s;es al&s;o in its Meaning, the Power or Faculty of uttering any &s;ort of Divine Di&s;cour&s;es, by vir|tue of an <HI>Impetus</HI> or immediate Power from the holy Spi|rit) I &s;ay, this is not the only In&s;tance of the U&s;e of <HI>Mu|&s;ic</HI> in order to <HI>Prophe&s;ying.</HI> The forementioned <HI>Saul</HI> meet|ing a company of Prophets with their <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> in the pro|phetical Exerci&s;e, is a further Confirmation of the Argu|ment before us. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10.5, 6. <HI>After that, thou &s;halt come to the Hill of God, where is the Garri&s;on of the</HI> Phili&s;tines, <HI>and it &s;hall come to pa&s;s when thou art come thither to the City, that thou &s;halt meet a company of Prophets coming down from the high Place, with a P&s;altery, and a Tahret, and a Pipe, and a Harp before them, and they &s;hall Prophe&s;y.

<P>BUT to have done with particular In&s;tances, let me add, that not only &s;ingle Per&s;ons have occa&s;ionally made u&s;e of <HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> as a fit preparative for the Reception of the Spirit of God, but the <HI>&s;tated Quires</HI> of the Church of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in their <HI>Ordinary Wor&s;hip,</HI> propo&s;ed no le&s;s Benefit from this divine Science, according to the Appointment of God. <HI>So the Sons of Jeduthun, Gedaliah, Zeri,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>under the Hands of their Father Jeduthun, prophe&s;ied with an Harp to give Thanks and to Prai&s;e the Lord.</HI> 1 Chron. 25.3.</P>
<P>UPON the whole we may conclude, that Mu&s;ic is not only a Means provided by the God of Nature and the Au|thor of all Religion, to di&s;pel and drive away the evil Influences of Satan, but al&s;o to prepare the Soul for the Reception of the In&s;piration of the holy Spirit. Nor will

Then is &s;he rais'd and tran&s;ported beyond the Limits of Time and Sen&s;e, and is &s;eated in the Lap of Eternity; where &s;he dwells upon everla&s;ting Themes, and becomes a &s;harer in the &s;weet and uninterrupted Bli&s;&s;es of Angels and glorified Saints.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>MUSIC is of good U&s;e in Religious Wor&s;hip, to excite and improve &s;uitable and proper Affections, according to the Diver&s;ity of Subjects, about which it is employed.</HI> The God of Nature has, be&s;ide the <HI>Intellectual and Volitive</HI> Faculty, implanted in the Soul of Man, divers Affections and Pa&s;|&s;ions.
<PB N="17" REF="002402_0023_0FDB3ACFA0E7E3A0">The&s;e are &s;o many <HI>Ministers</HI> to the &s;uperior Powers of Under&s;tanding and Willing. And by Con&s;equence, as the&s;e two are the <HI>prime Faculties</HI> of the Soul, which ought ever to be fir&s;t in Exerci&s;e in our religious Approa|ches to the Divine Being, (the <HI>Intellect</HI> being the Power of &s;piritual Apprehen&s;ion, Knowledge and Faith, and the <HI>Will</HI> the Principle of Divine Love, and all Devotion,) I &s;ay, as tho&s;e two Faculties are primarily and principally employed in all religious Exerci&s;es; &s;o the&s;e Affections and Pa&s;&s;ions be of &s;ubordinate U&s;e, and are &s;ub&s;ervient to the &s;ame De&s;igns of Religion and Devotion. For it was a gro&s;s Mi&s;take in tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers, who a&s;&s;erted them to be but the <HI>Foibles</HI> or Weakne&s;&s;es of the Soul, and <HI>natu|rally Sinful.</HI> No, they are naturally and phy&s;ically <HI>Good,</HI> and when they have been endowed with the Sanctification of the Holy Gho&s;t, they are of great and noble U&s;e in Religion.

Now when the&s;e are <HI>&s;anctified,</HI> they become capable of a mo&s;t excellent U&s;e and Improvement in Religion, e&s;pecially in all the devotionary Parts thereof. They are as it were the Wings of the Soul, whereby it is carried forth in all the Acts of holy Joy and Tran&s;port; Contrition and Mourning; Fervency and Zeal, and the like. But now what is more &s;uited and adapted to excite and pre&s;erve the&s;e Affections in their due and proper Exerci&s;e, than <HI>Mu&s;ic and Harmony?</HI> Whether the religious Soul be wholly employed upon Subjects of Con|trition and Penitence, Sorrow and Mourning, <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> can furni&s;h it with melancholy and graver Ayres: Or, if it dwells upon Themes of Joy and Prai&s;e, the loud and &s;prightly Notes of the more chearful Keys &s;hall rai&s;e the Soul to GOD, the Author of all good, and the Object of all our <HI>high Prai&s;es.</HI> And &s;o of the re&s;t.

<P>THERE remains &s;till <HI>One</HI> Exemple more of a <HI>Sweet P&s;al|mi&s;t,</HI> which is &s;o great and &s;o glorious, that it is impo&s;&s;i|ble <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> and <HI>P&s;almody</HI> &s;hould derive any further Honours from its Profe&s;&s;ors and Admirers, than what it has from His Practice and Approbation thereof, and that is our ble&s;|&s;ed <HI>Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST.</HI> Of whom it is re|corded by &s;ome of the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> that at the In&s;titution and Celebration of the <HI>Eucharist</HI> or <HI>holy Supper,</HI> He
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Matt. 26.30. Mark 14.26.</NOTE> <HI>&s;ang an Hymn</HI> with his Di&s;ciples. I have often thought how melodiou&s;ly and <HI>divinely</HI> Sweet, that ble&s;&s;ed Man, who was <HI>more than a Man,</HI> and who knew all the infinite Va|rieties, and even un&s;earchable Melodies, that lie hid in the Nature of Sounds, performed his Part in the Con&s;ort. And then how &s;uddenly and in&s;en&s;ibly are we rapt and carried away in our Thoughts to Heaven, to behold him there at the Head of the immortal Quires of the Saints and An|gels above!&mdash; But the Theme is too Sublime, the Thought too Va&s;t to be indulged by a mortal Quid, and it is not lawful to utter freely upon it; de&s;erving rather to be adored in profound Silence, than to &s;uffer thro' our rude and unhallowed E&s;&s;ays to de&s;cribe it!&mdash; All I &s;hall add is this, Behold <HI>the Son of God as a &s;weet P&s;almist,</HI> and allow the Character from henceforward to be truly great and honourable!</P>
