<HEAD>A LETTER, To the Honourable, Sir <HI>WILLIAM ASHH&V;RST,</HI> About the Pre&s;ent State of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> among the <HI>Chri&s;tianized <HI>Indians,</HI></HI> of <HI>New-England.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE la&s;t Letter wherewith you Honoured us, Dated in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> gives us to un|der&s;tand, how Acceptable it would be, to receive a fre&s;h and late Account, of the <HI>Progre&s;s made in Evangelizing the poor Sal|vages in this Countrey:</HI> And we &s;hall, as under all the Obligations imaginable to do it, Endeavour your &s;atisfaction in a Point &s;o worthy to be En|quird after; hoping that our Account may as <HI>Good News from a far Countrey,</HI> prove no ungrate|ful Entertainment.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Magnalia Chri&s;ti Americana,</HI> or, Hi&s;tory of <HI>New-England,</HI> Publi&s;hed at <HI>London,</HI> Two or Three Years ago, there is, The <HI>Life</HI> of our Me|morable ELIOT; In which there is a Letter to
<PB N="4" REF="001224_0003_0FB1815A68DA6B78">
Dr. <HI>Leu&s;den,</HI> a Profe&s;&s;or at <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> relating the Succe&s;s of the Go&s;pel among our <HI>Americans;</HI> and a full Commentary upon every Article of that Letter, declaring <HI>Who</HI> were Employ'd in that noble work, and <HI>How</HI> they managed it. And in another part of that Book, there is a long Chapter, Entituled, <HI>The Triumphs of Grace, or, A Narrative of the Succe&s;s which the Go&s;pel has had among the</HI> Indians <HI>of New-England;</HI> a Narrative, as well Atte&s;ted as it is Remarkable. We &s;hall not now Tran&s;cribe any Paragraphs of that Hi&s;tory; becau&s;e tis ea&s;y to have recour&s;e unto it. But they that would in&s;inuate, as if the People of our Profe&s;&s;ion, in <HI>America,</HI> (who are for Embracing &amp; Diffu&s;ing, the Holy Religion of Chri&s;t, in the <HI>Original Purity</HI> wherein His Go&s;pel has given it unto us, with|out Humane Additions and Inventions) did no|thing to Propagate the Religion we Profe&s;s, will there find a &s;ufficient Confutation.</P>
<P>We will now proceed, where that Hi&s;tory leaves off; and lay before your Honour, the pre|&s;ent Circum&s;tances of the <HI>Evangelical Work</HI> among our <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>There were in the Southern parts of this Pro|vince, about Four or Five Years ago, (when your Commi&s;&s;ioners here &s;ent a Couple of Engli&s;h Mi|ni&s;ters, who were Ma&s;ters of the Indian Tongue, to vi&s;it them,) no le&s;s than <HI>Thirty &s;everal Con|gregations</HI> of <HI>Indians,</HI> who commonly A&s;&s;embled every <HI>Lords Day,</HI> and a great part of them to
<PB N="5" REF="001224_0004_0FB1815BF9F3C120" MS="y">
<HI>Lectures</HI> on other Dayes al&s;o, for the Wor&s;hip of the Great GOD, and our Lord JESUS CHRIST. We cannot under&s;tand, That the Number of the Congregations, is con&s;iderably altered from what it was, when the Gentlemen, who then Examined their Condition, brought us that Report of them.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Number of <HI>Indians</HI> in this Land, is not Comparable to what it was Fifty Years a|go. The Hand of God, has very &s;trangely wa&s;ted them; and the <HI>War</HI> which they began upon the Engli&s;h in the Year, 1675. ha&s;tened a &s;trange De&s;olation upon whole Nations of them. Almo&s;t all that remain under the Influences of the Eng|li&s;h in this <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et</HI> Province are &s;o far Chri&s;ti|anized, as that they Believe there is a God, and but One God, and that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God, and the Saviour of the World. Mr. <HI>Ex|perience Mayhew,</HI> who is Grand&s;on, to the Old Gentleman that fir&s;t In&s;tructed the Indians on <HI>Martha's Vineyard,</HI> and like his Grandfather, a Laborious Teacher among them, informs us; That there are about One Hundred and Four-Score Families of <HI>Indians</HI> on that I&s;land; and that of the&s;e there are no more than Two Per&s;ons, which now remain in their Pagani&s;m. He is at this Time, gathering another Church of <HI>Indians,</HI> whereof he is him&s;elf to be the <HI>Pa&s;tor.</HI></P>
<P>In the Indian Congregations, there were, at the Time of our la&s;t Vi&s;itation, (which we &s;aid, was about Four or Five Years ago,) about
<PB N="6" REF="001224_0005_0FB1815D6B3A9AC8">
<HI>Thirty Seven</HI> Indians, who were the con&s;tant Preachers of the Go&s;pel unto them, in their own Language; In which they have <HI>Catechi&s;ms,</HI> and <HI>Bibles,</HI> and <HI>P&s;alm-books,</HI> and other Books of Pie|ty; Tran&s;lated by the va&s;t Labours of worthy Engli&s;h-men.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are Seven or Eight <HI>Engli&s;h Mini&s;ters,</HI> who have Learn'd the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue, and Vi&s;it the <HI>Indian</HI> A&s;&s;emblies, and <HI>Pray,</HI> and <HI>Preach</HI> among them, and give &s;uch Directions, as they &s;ee needful for their Affairs. The <HI>Indian</HI> Mini&s;ters, very frequently apply them&s;elves to the&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ones, for their Advice, about In|&s;tructing their Flocks under their Charge. And &s;ome of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Preachers, do con&s;tantly &s;pend every <HI>Lords Day,</HI> with the <HI>Indian</HI> A&s;&s;emblies; having taken the Charge of them.</P>
<P>How the Ordinary Congregations among the <HI>Indians</HI> are inclined, and how in&s;tructed, may be a little apprehended, from &s;ome Lines in a Letter, now lying before us, Dated not many Weeks ago, from a very Valuable Servant of God, namely, Mr. <HI>Samuel Danforth.</HI> He &s;ayes; <Q>They met me at <HI>Little Compton</HI> about two Months &s;ince, to hear me Preach: Had you been there with me to &s;ee how well they fill'd up the <HI>Seats;</HI> with what <HI>Gravity</HI> they behaved them&s;elves; what <HI>Attention</HI> they gave; what <HI>Affection</HI> they &s;hew'd; how powerfully <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">quachoi&s;e</HI> [an In|dian, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> Pray'd; (for I put him upon it, to
<PB N="7" REF="001224_0006_0FB1815F0978FCE0">
<HI>Pray,</HI> having never before heard him <HI>Pray,</HI> and being willing to have &s;ome Trial of his Abili|ties, in order to his Approbation for Office;) how melodiou&s;ly <HI>Jonathan George</HI> [another In|dian] &s;et the Tune for the <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> and carried it out; and how dexterou&s;ly the Young Lads of Twelve Years old, could turn to the <HI>Proofs</HI> thro' out the Sermon; and how Thankful they were to me at the la&s;t, that I would take &s;o much Pains, as to come &s;o far from home, to Preach to them; I am &s;ure, you would have been much affected with it.</Q></P>
<P>Tho' there are &s;ome Congregations of the <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> which are not Advanced unto all the Privi|ledges of the Evangelical <HI>Church-state,</HI> Combining for, and Enjoying of, <HI>all &s;pecial Ordinances;</HI> yet a con&s;iderable Number of them are &s;o. Some <HI>New Churches</HI> have been lately form'd, and fill'd; and more will quickly be Gathered. They have <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>Elders</HI> of their own; <HI>Ordained,</HI> &s;ome times by the Hands of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters, and &s;ometimes by the Hands of <HI>Indian</HI> Mini&s;ters, in the pre&s;ence of the Engli&s;h; all after the &s;olemn Engli&s;h manner. And by <HI>Admonitions,</HI> and <HI>Ex|communications,</HI> Publickly di&s;pen&s;ed, they proceed again&s;t Scandalous Offendors, when any &s;uch are found among them.</P>
<P>We &s;hall here in&s;ert, an Extract of a late Letter, from Mr. <HI>Jo&s;iah Torrey,</HI> an hopeful Young Man, who has Learned the Indian Tongue, and
<PB N="8" REF="001224_0007_0FB181625317D910">
begins to Preach to them in their own Language. He having been an Eye-witne&s;s of their proceed|ings, writes to us in words following.</P>
<P><Q>Their Gravity, and diligent Attendance in the Time of Wor&s;hip, with the affectionate Con|fe&s;&s;ions of &s;uch as are Admitted into the Church, make me hope, that many of them may have the work of the Spirit wrought in them, <HI>accord|ing to the working of the mighty Power of God.</HI> Their method, re&s;pecting tho&s;e that are Admit|ted into their Church Communion, is more ac|cording to the manner of the Churches in the Primitive Times, than is now practi&s;ed among the Churches in mo&s;t parts. The per&s;on to be Admitted, &s;tands forth, in the mid&s;t of the A&s;&s;embly; and fir&s;t makes Declaration of his <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and &s;ometimes de&s;ires Informations in Things more arduous and doubtful. And then, he makes a <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin;</HI> which they do, (as I have &s;een,) with <HI>Tears</HI> and <HI>Trembling,</HI> like him in the <HI>Sixteenth</HI> Chapter of the <HI>Acts.</HI> And then, he gives an Account of <HI>Experiences</HI> he has had, of Convictions, Awakenings, and Comforts, in which they are large and particular. After which, (much Coun&s;el and Exhortation, to remain &s;tedfa&s;t in the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Wayes</HI> of the Lord, being given them, by their <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Elder,</HI> they are Admitted. I would (and not ungroundedly) hope, That <HI>Additions</HI> are <HI>made unto the Church daily of &s;uch as &s;hall be Saved.</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="001224_0008_0FB18164AA0D59B0">
There are many, which maintain a Chri&s;tian Conver&s;ation, and are to be accounted, not <HI>Almo&s;t,</HI> but <HI>Altogether Chri&s;tians.</HI> And this does Encourage the Preaching of the Go&s;pel to them, when we &s;ee, it plea&s;es God, to make it <HI>His Power unto Salvation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>About the <HI>Manner</HI> of performing the more <HI>Stated Exerci&s;es</HI> of Religion, in Publick, among the <HI>Indians,</HI> there needs no Account but this; They are Conformed unto the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> But we have now before us, a Letter very lately re|ceived, from as knowing and as faithful a Per&s;on as could be Enquired of, wherein he &s;peaks a little more particularly.</P>
<P>He &s;ayes; <Q>You may Remember, That your &s;elf, with &s;ome others, were plea&s;ed once to bear me Company, to a Lecture at <HI>A&s;&s;awamp&s;et,</HI> and were an Eye-witne&s;s, of their Grave, Seri|ous, Attentive Deportment, in their Exer|ci&s;es, and of their Excellent <HI>Singing of P&s;alms,</HI> with mo&s;t ravi&s;hing Melody. They begin their Exerci&s;es with <HI>Prayer;</HI> Then Sing a <HI>P&s;alm;</HI> Then <HI>Preach;</HI> and &s;o Conclude with <HI>Prayer.</HI> The Admini&s;tration of <HI>Sacraments</HI> among them, is like <HI>Ours,</HI> and as they we<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ght by their Apo&s;tle ELIOT. His Name is of wonderful Authority among them; and the Rules he gave them, for the Form of <HI>Marriages</HI> among them, and for <HI>Admonitions</HI> and <HI>Excommunications</HI> in their Churches, are not to be found fault with
<PB N="10" REF="001224_0009_0FB18165B2B71BC8">
by any, but it will provoke them. Not long &s;ince, an <HI>Indian</HI> Lodg'd at an <HI>Engli&s;h mans</HI> Hou&s;e one Night; and the next Day he vi&s;ited me, and ask'd, <HI>Why the man at who&s;e Hou&s;e he Lodg'd, did not Pray in his Family?</HI> Seeing that Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> taught the <HI>Indians</HI> to do it every Day, Morning and Evening: he thought it &s;trange, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould direct them to <HI>Pray in their Families,</HI> and yet not do it them&s;elves. But at la&s;t, he entertained the <HI>Di&s;tinction;</HI> That there were <HI>Matchet</HI> Engli&s;h men, as well as <HI>Matchet</HI> Indians; and that &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> did not practi&s;e, as they had been taught to do. [<HI>Matchet;</HI> that is to &s;ay, Naughty, or Wick|ed.]</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame Gentleman, thus proceeds in that Letter.</P>
<P><Q>To your la&s;t Enquiry, <HI>What I think there may be of Piety among them?</HI> Sir, I think, that there were many of the Old Generation, who were in&s;tructed by the Reverend ELIOT, and others, which <HI>Died in the Lord,</HI> and the <HI>Fir&s;t Fruits</HI> of them are in Heaven, as an <HI>Earne&s;t</HI> of more to follow. I think, the <HI>Cen&s;orious Engli&s;h</HI> among us, are not to be the <HI>Rule for our Charity</HI> about them. Yet let me &s;ay; I could never yet En|quire of any Plantation, or A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Indians,</HI> but the mo&s;t <HI>Cen&s;orious Engli&s;h</HI> would grant, There were <HI>Three</HI> or <HI>Four</HI> Per&s;ons in that Plan|tation, who, they verily believed, were <HI>Sound
<PB N="11" REF="001224_0010_0FB1816731D8E8F8">
Chri&s;tians,</HI> tho' they Condemned the re&s;t. Whereas a <HI>Charitable</HI> man, would have reckon'd the&s;e <HI>Three</HI> or <HI>Four,</HI> to have been the mo&s;t <HI>Emi|nent for Peity</HI> among them; and have granted the re&s;t, to have &s;uch a mea&s;ure of <HI>Knowledge</HI> in the Go&s;pel-method of Salvation, and to be &s;o ready to &s;ubmit with mo&s;t admirable <HI>Patience</HI> to the <HI>Church Cen&s;ures</HI> among them, and &s;o <HI>Penitent</HI> in their Confe&s;&s;ions of their Faults, and Fearful afterwards of Relap&s;ing into the &s;ame or like Faults; as might be a ju&s;t Foundation to hope, That they are Travelling the right way to Heaven.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Frenchified Indians</HI> in the Ea&s;tern parts of this Province, have by their long Wars upon us, denied us an Opportunity to <HI>Chri&s;tianize</HI> them. While Sir <HI>William Phips</HI> was our Governour, we had One Years Peace with tho&s;e Indians; And in that Year, we furni&s;hed the Governour, with a Preacher, to carry the offer of the Go&s;pel unto them. But while the Preacher was preparing for his Journey, they perfidiou&s;ly broke out into New Ho&s;tilities; by which our Attempt was then defeated. When the Earl of <HI>Bellomont</HI> became our Governour, we had a longer lucid Interval of Peace with them. In this time, there came &s;everal of their Chief men to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> whom the Governour &s;ent unto one of us, to be di&s;cour&s;ed about matters of Religion. When they were
<PB N="12" REF="001224_0011_0FB18168A8427520">
told; <HI>That they ought to Wor&s;hip none but that God, who made Heaven and Earth,</HI> and, <HI>That the Wor|&s;hip of Graven Images, Crucifixes, the Virgin</HI> Mary, <HI>and other Saints, was di&s;plea&s;ing to the Great and only True God;</HI> they &s;tood like men amaz'd; they replied not a word. They were then told, <HI>That we would &s;end Mini&s;ters unto them, who &s;hould in|&s;truct them in the true way to Eternal Life, if they would receive them:</HI> Whereupon they declared, They were not willing that any &s;hould be &s;ent unto them. The <HI>French Prie&s;ts</HI> have made them, rather <HI>twice more the Children of Hell,</HI> (more a|ver&s;e to true <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI>) than while they were meer <HI>Pagans.</HI> Yet we gave not over. We found our Applications to <HI>Engli&s;h Preachers</HI> ineffectual; we applied our &s;elves unto <HI>Indian Preachers,</HI> in hopes, that &s;ome &s;uch might be prevailed withal, to run the de&s;perate Hazards of carrying the Go&s;pel unto that <HI>Fooli&s;h people,</HI> and imparting to them the Oracles which might make them <HI>Wi&s;e unto Salvation.</HI> But while we were pro&s;e|cuting this De&s;ign, they treacherou&s;ly and bar|barou&s;ly murdered near an Hundred of our Peo-who, upon the Faith of a <HI>Peace,</HI> which they had ju&s;t before Sworn to, were Lovingly treating them in their Hou&s;es; and Commenced that grievous and bloody <HI>War,</HI> which is not yet ended.</P>
<P>We have heretofore been at con&s;iderable Ex|pences, to Encourage the E&s;&s;ayes of Good men,
<PB N="13" REF="001224_0012_0FB1816BE42138C8">
to Chri&s;tianize the <HI>Mohegin</HI> Indians, in the Colo|ny of <HI>Connecticut.</HI> But they have been Ob&s;ti|nate in their Pagani&s;m; and their Ob&s;tinacy has put a &s;top at pre&s;ent unto our Endeavours; which yet we will Revive, as &s;oon and as well as we can.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t Exemplary <HI>Indian Mini&s;ter,</HI> who&s;e Name is <HI>Japhet,</HI> has of late made &s;everal Vi&s;its among his Countrey men the <HI>Pagan Indians,</HI> about the <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI> Countrey; and God has Crown'd his Endeavours with con&s;iderable Succe&s;&s;es. We Re&s;olve to give him all po&s;&s;ible Encouragement.</P>
<P>We have left no Stone unturned, that we might obtain &s;ome Able and Faithful <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries,</HI> for the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> that are &s;ome Hundreds of Miles di&s;tant from us, to the We&s;tward. All that we have hitherto accompli&s;hed, is, That we have Supported and Rewarded (and at this Day continue to do &s;o,) the Pains of &s;everal <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini&s;ters, who proceed as far as they can, in Communicating the Knowledge of GOD and CHRIST, unto tho&s;e di&s;tant Salvages. And of late, they have &s;een &s;ome de&s;irable Succe&s;&s;es of their Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The main Support, that we have had for the Ex|pen&s;ive part of this Work, has been from the Revenues, remitted hither, by the Honourable <HI>Corporation, for Propagating the Go&s;pel among the Indians.</HI> But then, the Liberality of Pious men,
<PB N="14" REF="001224_0013_0FB1816E1C3B5B20">
among our &s;elves has al&s;o been Employ'd this way, upon multiplied occa&s;ions. Particular Gentlemen in this Countrey, have often <HI>Devi&s;ed Liberal Things,</HI> to promote Chri&s;tianity among the <HI>Indians.</HI> Be&s;ides many other Expre&s;&s;ions of Charity towards them, given by others, we ought not to leave unmentioned, the <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;e,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Samuel Sewall,</HI> (the Secretary to your Commi&s;&s;ioners here) has Built for them; and the Books, the Publi&s;hing and Scattering of which <HI>Mr. Edward Bromfield,</HI> (another of your Commi&s;&s;ioners) has more than once procured to Fortify them again&s;t their Peculiar Temp|tations, and Enlighten them in the My&s;teries of God.</P>
<P>The Studies of your <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners,</HI> are now Engaging more Particularly, upon the Intenti|ons, of bringing the <HI>Indians</HI> into the mo&s;t <HI>Com|pact</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Circum&s;tances, that can be Propo&s;ed. But this mu&s;t be a work of Time; and in the mean time, tho' we could with the Evangelical Work among the <HI>Indians</HI> had le&s;s Difficulties to Clog it, yet we have Rea&s;on to be glad, that &s;o much of Chri&s;tianity and Pro&s;|perity does attend it, as there does.</P>
<P>As the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Natives</HI> to our Holy Religion, was One Special Thing pro|pounded, by tho&s;e Good Men that fir&s;t Planted this Countrey, when a wa&s;t and va&s;t Wilderne&s;s; &s;o the Salvation of the many <HI>Natives</HI> that have
<PB N="15" REF="001224_0014_0FB1816F746B0588">
been here Converted unto God, has been richly worth all the Pains and Co&s;ts therein Expended.</P>
<P>We render to Your Honour, and to the Honourable Corporation, our mo&s;t grateful Ac|knowledgments of all Your Pious Care, to for|ward a Work, wherein the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and the Weal of many Souls, are &s;o greatly Concerned: Recommending You to the Divine Favour, we Sub&s;cribe,</P>
