<P>_AS it is highly probable, that I am upon this occa&s;ion, to di&s;cour&s;e to per&s;ons of &s;everal denominations, I have pitched upon a &s;ub|ject equally intere&s;ting and obligatory upon all. For though we may differ and di&s;pute about things of an inferior nature, yet in the duty of <HI>univer&s;al</HI> bene|volence, which St. <HI>Paul</HI> makes the <HI>fulfilling of the law;</HI> (and is the <HI>chief corner-&s;tone,</HI> on which this antient fra|ternity is founded; at who&s;e de&s;ire I appear <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">e this day:) It would be uncharitable even to &s;u&s;pect a di&s;a|greement.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007370_0005_102B58FA9A668F68">
WE are &s;ent into this world, nece&s;&s;itous weak creatures, nece&s;&s;arily depending upon one another for the &s;upply of manifold wants, and a great part of the po&s;itive comforts and enjoyments of life; It has therefore plea&s;ed the infi|nitely wi&s;e and good Author of our beings, to provide a remedy again&s;t tho&s;e evils, to which the indigency and frailty of our &s;tate &s;ubject us, by forming us with di&s;po&s;i|tions of charity, with tender, &s;ocial, friendly, and generous affections for one another, which ought carefully to be cheri&s;hed and cultivated, in order to remove, at lea&s;t alle|viate the mi&s;eries that abound in the world, and to pro|mote the ea&s;e and happine&s;s of every individual.</P>
<P>THIS love according to a great
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle.</NOTE> philo&s;opher, re&s;ults from the grounds of affinity and re&s;emblance among men. And if &s;o, mu&s;t be a branch of the primitive law of nature.</P>
<P>AND it appears from <HI>Lev.</HI> xix. 18. that it was an ac|knowledged precept of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Religion.&mdash;How then comes it to pa&s;s, that love is enjoined as a new command|in the go&s;pel, and is made a peculiar characteri&s;tic of the chri&s;tian religion? The an&s;wer is, both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> (it is allowed) did adopt this precept into their re&s;pective religions, but they maintain'd it in a very limi|ted and contracted &s;en&s;e: They made all their concerns terminate in them&s;elves. As to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> this in &s;ome
<PB N="9" REF="007370_0006_102B58CEF76B2A10">mea&s;ure appears, from our ble&s;&s;ed LORD'S rea&s;oning with his di&s;ciples in the IVth of St. <HI>Matthew's</HI> go&s;pel, upon this very &s;ubject; where he informs them, that if they did not extend their love to &s;uch as were their enemies, they had no di&s;tingui&s;hing excellency: <HI>for if they loved tho&s;e only who loved them, what Reward had they? Do not even Publicans</HI> (who were heathens by profe&s;&s;ion) <HI>do the &s;ame?</HI> You &s;ee the foundation and extent of the duty as ob&s;erved by the <HI>Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>AND the <HI>Jews</HI> were as &s;hamefully deficient: for by one another, or neighbour, which &s;eem to be terms equi|valent, they under&s;tood only a <HI>Jew,</HI> one of their own nation or a pro&s;elyte at mo&s;t; and the law, <HI>Lev.</HI> xix. that enjoins, <HI>the duty favours this &s;en&s;e: Thou &s;halt not bear any grudge again&s;t the children of thy people, but thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI> The children of thy peo|ple, and neighbour, &s;eem to expre&s;s the &s;ame thing. GOD had fenced them in with ordinances, on purpo&s;e to keep them a &s;eparate and di&s;tinct <HI>nation</HI> from all <HI>other</HI> nations, who were <HI>&s;tigmatized as aliens from the common-wealth of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>and &s;trangers from the covenant of promi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>BUT now, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD! the <HI>wall of partition</HI> be|ing broken down, and GOD di&s;covered to be no <HI>re&s;pecter of per&s;ons; the laws of our common</HI> LORD, <HI>and the mer|cies of redemption, extending at lea&s;t to all, within the
<PB N="10" REF="007370_0007_102B58FC1F034908">&s;ound of the go&s;pel: For as by the offence of one, judg|ment came upon all men to condemnation, even &s;o by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free-gi&s;t came upon all men to ju&s;|tification of life.</HI> The blood of CHRIST cementing all mankind together, by his ta&s;teing death for every man, and the favour of GOD being &s;o univer&s;ally extended, as to invite all men, to mercy: Our duty mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily be co-extended with his grace, and our charity mu&s;t con<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> in imitating our LORD and Saviour.</P>
<P>By the laws of our religion therefore, we are to carry on benevolence to the utmo&s;t compa&s;s and extent; to enemies as well as friends; to all without exception with|in the &s;phere of our authority.</P>
<P>Well then, and with the greate&s;t propriety did our ble&s;&s;ed LORD call this duty of loving one another, a new commandment, &s;ince to the extent and mea&s;ure of it, the world were altogether &s;trangers before.</P>
<P><HI>A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another.</HI></P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing on the words, I &s;hall <HI>fir&s;t</HI> endeavour to &s;hew, wherein this love to one another con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, &s;hall con&s;ider the object of this love.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="007370_0008_102B58D0836BD2F0">
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> The excellency of it.</P>
<P>AND, in the <HI>la&s;t</HI> place, hope I &s;hall be able to make it appear, that the antient fraternity of free and accepted MASONS, is governed by the principle of univer&s;al love; and other, the mo&s;t important principles of morality in all their proceedings.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I am to endeavour to &s;hew, wherein love to one another con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>MORALISTS u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;h between a love of e&s;teem, and complacency, and of benevolence and good|will: And the di&s;tinction is ju&s;t, for it is impo&s;&s;ible in the very nature of the thing, to love every individual with complacency and e&s;teem; but benevolence may, and ought to be extended to all. The actions and quali|ties of men, do not only differ in their own nature, but in &s;ome re&s;pects are often contrary to one another. Good and evil are as oppo&s;ite as pain and plea&s;ure, the nature of things is unalterable. Some per&s;ons mu&s;t therefore ap|pear amiable and agreeable, others di&s;agreeable and odi|ous: If men are unju&s;t, and injurious, we can neither ap|prove their actions, nor be delighted with their charac|ters: If they are debauched and prophane, we are obli|ged to withdraw from their &s;ociety and conver&s;ation, be|cau&s;e con&s;orting with, and delighting in the company of &s;uch per&s;ons, if it does not di&s;cover an entire approbation
<PB N="12" REF="007370_0009_102B58FE658554D8">of their ways, yet, at the lea&s;t, it argues a very indiffer|ent concern for the honour of GOD.</P>
<P>BUT however we may di&s;approve of the conduct of &s;uch per&s;ons, and dete&s;t their proceedings; yet we are to wi&s;h well to them, to promote their temporal, and &s;pi|ritual happine&s;s, as we <HI>have opportunity, and that fervent|ly, and with a pure heart. Seeing ye have purified your &s;ouls in obeying the truth,</HI> (&s;ays St. <HI>Peter,</HI>) <HI>through the &s;pirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren; &s;ee that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently.</HI> 1 Pet. i. 20, 21.</P>
<P>AND have we not a glorious <HI>example</HI> to <HI>imitate,</HI> the Fa|ther of all &s;pirits, the almighty architect of heaven and earth, who is loving, and gracious unto all, <HI>&s;howers down his ble&s;&s;ings,</HI> without di&s;tinction upon the ju&s;t, and on the unju&s;t; is bountiful even to his profe&s;t enemies, the ob|jects of his wrath and indignation.</P>
<P>But &s;till his favour and e&s;teem without reformation can|not be expected; &s;o far from it, that &s;uch iniquity is an abomination to him, yet, notwith&s;tanding he earne&s;tly &s;eeks their recovery, and de&s;ires their welfare. So plain is the di&s;tinction between that love which con&s;i&s;ts in benevolence, and that of complacency and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>BUT in&s;tead of duly ob&s;erving this di&s;tinction, men are led to entertain very fal&s;e notions of the duty; and
<PB N="13" REF="007370_0010_102B5900EDE5C950">by confounding the&s;e ideas, do repre&s;ent it to them&s;elves and others, in a very wrong light, and thereby magnify the difficulty of putting it in practice.&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible &s;ay they, for a man to love his enemy! one that injuriou&s;ly treats him, and would willingly ruin and de&s;troy him? Is this con&s;i&s;tent with the great law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation? Is it reconcilable with rea&s;on?</P>
<P>Now I readily allow, that our corrupted nature in&s;tead of &s;ubmitting to, and acknowledging the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the precept, &s;eems to dictate quite the rever&s;e, repre|&s;ents it highly unrea&s;onable to love &s;uch as would ruin or de&s;troy us.&mdash;Before any man can di&s;cover the fitne&s;s and propriety of &s;uch practice, he mu&s;t be freed from the influence of natural corruption, and rai&s;'d above the level of human rea&s;on; he mu&s;t entertain a very exalted opinion of the chri&s;tian religion; mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a generous love for the author of it, with true faith in him, and the promi&s;es of another life, in order to over|ballance his natural &s;entiments, and aver&s;ions in the ca&s;e, to qualify him to think and practi&s;e &s;o di&s;agreeably to nature.</P>
<P>THERE can be no &s;uch love, (it is granted) where the fle&s;hly principle rules, and acts. For all its motions and &s;ugge&s;tions have re&s;pect only to &s;elf; the plea&s;ures, the honours, the riches <HI>of this life.</HI> And while the&s;e things
<PB N="14" REF="007370_0011_102B59BC3096E760">are only pur&s;ued; and the <HI>law in the members</HI> prevails, this rule will be altogether impracticable: For it is not to be conceived, that a covetous, or intemperate man &s;hould love others, as well as he does him&s;elf. But when once this corrupt principle, and the &s;ugge&s;tions that &s;pring from it are mortified and corrected, and grace gains the a&s;cen|dant; when the &s;pirit of GOD once takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the man, it will produce true chri&s;tian love; for one of the <HI>fruits of the &s;pirit is love.</HI> This will attract our minds to GOD, kindle in us a lively flame after him, and nece&s;&s;arily unite us to &s;uch as bear his image; not from any mean, pitiful motives of intere&s;t, but from the &s;piritual alliance we contract with him, and one another; which di&s;po&s;es us to perform his commands, to de&s;ire his favours, to imitate his actions and example, as well as tho&s;e of his beloved SON, re&s;embling them both, as much, and as near as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;This is loving one another, accord|ing to the new commandment; i. e. from and upon a chri&s;tian principle.</P>
<P>OH! the infinite goodne&s;s of GOD! notwith&s;tanding our ba&s;ene&s;s, our ingratitude for all his favours; yet He &s;till di&s;covers a di&s;po&s;ition of doing us good, is grieved at our folly and mi&s;ery; freely forgives the one, and cures the other, upon our &s;incere endeavours of returning to him. Oh! the incomprehen&s;ible love of CHRIST the REDEEMER! who died for us, when we were enemies
<PB N="15" REF="007370_0012_102B59C0545C5B48">to him. And &s;hall not we love one another, love the very wor&s;t of men, wi&s;h them well, pray for them, do them good, forgive them, tho' they cur&s;e, hate, and di&s;|pitefully u&s;e us? Nay, lay down our lives for their &s;er|vice, (if need be) after the example of our gracious SAVIOUR. What generous, what di&s;intere&s;ted love is this that the chri&s;tian religion inculcates and di&s;plays to the world? Upon what exalted motives and con&s;iderations does it turn. A perfect contempt of all earthly intere&s;t, all temporal applau&s;e.</P>
<P>SUCH a love was certainly new, when it fir&s;t appeared among our LORD's di&s;ciples: And I am &s;orry to &s;ay that an exertion of it in its full extent would appear as new now, as it was then, even among tho&s;e that profe&s;s them|&s;elves his mo&s;t zealous followers.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;hewn wherein a due di&s;charge of the com|mandment in the text con&s;i&s;ts, I &s;hall now con&s;ider the ob|ject of this love, one another. That is, all mankind; all who partake of the common nature with our&s;elves wherever di&s;pers'd. But becau&s;e our powers are limitted, the &s;acred writings with the greate&s;t propriety recommend this be|nevolence to our neighbours more particularly; to tho&s;e with whom we are more immediately conver&s;e, and are acquainted. The <HI>Jews</HI> by neighbour, as has been already ob&s;erved, under&s;tood one of their own nation. And when
<PB N="16" REF="007370_0013_102B59C21CB4ADB8">this duty was pre&s;s'd upon them, they were wont to con|fider it in a very confined and limited &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT our ble&s;&s;ed LORD corrected their contracted notion of the duty, and &s;et it in a more exten&s;ive and ju&s;t light, in an&s;wer to a que&s;tion propo&s;ed by a lawyer; which was exactly to the Point.</P>
<P>THE que&s;tion was, and who is my neighbour?</P>
<P>HERE I beg leave to ob&s;erve, that as the eternal SON of GOD de&s;cended <HI>from</HI> the bo&s;om of his father, to in&s;truct the world in a new <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> to lay before them many unacceptable doctrines to <HI>fle&s;h</HI> and <HI>blood;</HI> He often cho&s;e to addre&s;s them in the parabolick way, as the mo&s;t engaging method to win over the well di&s;|po&s;ed to hear and apply, and to print his le&s;&s;ons in the mo&s;t lively and la&s;ting characters on their minds.</P>
<P><HI>THUS he proceeds in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, and re&s;olves the lawyer's que&s;tion, by propo&s;ing a parable, which is expre&s;&s;ed in the</HI> &s;tronge&s;t, <HI>and mo&s;t engaging manner.</HI> Luk. <HI>x.</HI> 30, &amp;c. A certain man went down from Jeru|&s;alem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, who &s;tripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance, there came down a cer|tain prie&s;t that way; and when he &s;aw him, he pa&s;&s;ed by on the other &s;ide. And likewi&s;e a Levite, when he was at the place, came, and looked on him, and pa&s;&s;ed by on the
<PB N="17" REF="007370_0014_102B59C3AAC0AFD8">other &s;ide. But a certain Samaritane, as he journeyed, came where be was. And when he &s;aw him, he had com|pa&s;&s;ion on him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and &s;et him on his own bea&s;t, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow, when he departed, he took out two-pence, and gave them to the ho&s;t, and &s;aid unto him, take care of him; and what&s;oever thou &s;pende&s;t more, when I come again, I will repay thee. Which now of the&s;e three, thinke&s;t thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? And he &s;aid, he that &s;hewed mercy on him. Then &s;aid <HI>JESUS</HI> unto him, go, and do thou likewi&s;e. <HI>i. e. Thou ha&s;t an&s;wered thy&s;elf: Every per&s;on that &s;tands in need of thy relief, be he</HI> Jew <HI>or</HI> Samaritane, <HI>is thy neighbour; and to him are thy good offices to be extended.</HI></P>
<P>BUT is our benevolence to be equally extended to all? This I do not maintain.&mdash;We are undoubtedly to do good unto all men, but the Text gives a preference to &s;ome, <HI>e&s;pecially to them that are of the hou&s;hold of faith.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS highly rea&s;onable that the mo&s;t lovely objects &s;hould be the greater partakers of our love. There is nothing &s;o amiable as true goodne&s;s. Commen&s;urate then to this, ought the degree of our love to be. GOD is the object of our greate&s;t love, becau&s;e he is perfectly and originally good. As men then more or le&s;s re&s;emble
<PB N="18" REF="007370_0015_102B59C829312A80">him, the greater or the le&s;s complacency ought we to take in them, and the le&s;s ardently to de&s;ire, or endeavour to promote their welfare. True chri&s;tian love chiefly con&s;i&s;ts, in loving his image, from whom we are denomi|nated chri&s;tians: Where that di&s;plays it&s;elf with mo&s;t advantage, there, in a proportionable degree, is our love to take place. Indeed nature as well as &s;cripture pre&s;cribes different degrees of love, in proportion to the amiablene&s;s and value of the object. But this does not at all affect the point I have in view, which is, that our love is to extend to all, though not in the &s;ame degree, that we are to de&s;ire, and as far as is in our power, to promote the happine&s;s of every man living.</P>
<P>THE excellency of this duty is now to be con&s;idered. The beloved di&s;ciple &s;eems to be in raptures, whenever he <HI>di&s;cour&s;es</HI> of love; he makes it the very e&s;&s;ence of the Deity. GOD <HI>is love. He makes it the only &s;ure mark of our regeneration; we know, that we have pa&s;|&s;ed from death to life, becau&s;e we love the brethren.</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> al&s;o earne&s;tly inculcates the &s;ame duty.&mdash;<HI>Owe no man any thing,</HI> (&s;ays he,) <HI>but to love one another, for he that loveth another, hath fulfilled the law.</HI> In &s;hort, he prefers this grace to all other endowments, and accom|pli&s;hments; indeed none of them <HI>in his judgment were of any con&s;equence without it.</HI> 1 Cor. xiii. 1, 2, 3, 4. <HI>For though I &s;peak with the Tongues of men and angels, and
<PB N="19" REF="007370_0016_102B59C9ADF3FE08">have not charity, I am become as &s;ounding bra&s;s, and a thinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and under&s;tand all my&s;teries, and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, &s;o that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing: And though I be&s;tow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</HI> Here we have the excellency of charity &s;ufficiently di&s;|played; but our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR gives it the fini&s;hing &s;troke, being <HI>plea&s;ed to make it the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of his di&s;ciples.</HI> Joh. xiii. 35. <HI>By this</HI> (&s;ays he,) <HI>&s;hall all men know, that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye have love one for another;</HI> He likewi&s;e particularly prays, that this <HI>Grace might animate and influence them,</HI> that they <HI>may be all one, as thou father art in me, and I in thee;</HI> i. e. united in love, having one heart and one &s;oul: And for this <HI>be a&s;&s;igns a mo&s;t important rea&s;on; that the world may believe, that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me.</HI> Joh. xvii. 21. Here are the highe&s;t encomiums conceivable, pa&s;&s;ed upon this grace; and this without any other, is a &s;ufficient proof of its excellency, &s;ince it evinces the truth of chri&s;tianity, when it manife&s;ts it&s;elf in the lives of its profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>I am now to &s;hew, that the antient fraternity of free and accepted MASONS is governed by the univer&s;al love; and make it with other moral principles of the greate&s;t importance, the rule of all their proceedings.</P>

FOR the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, I mu&s;t refer the inqui|&s;itive to the book of con&s;titutions, publi&s;hed by the au|thority and approbation of the whole &s;ociety of MASONS, wherein it is thus declared;</P>
<P><Q>You mu&s;t avoid all wrath, malice, and rancor, not &s;aying or doing any thing that may hinder either the continuance, or the renewal of brotherly love and friend&s;hip, which is the glory and cement of this an|cient fraternity; that we may &s;hew to all the world the benign influence of MASONRY; all, all wi&s;e and true brothers have done from the beginning of time, and will do, 'till architecture be di&s;&s;olved in the ge|neral conflagration.</Q>&mdash;Again, <Q>free and accepted MASONS have been ever charged to avoid all &s;lander|ing and backbiting, all malice or unju&s;t re&s;entment.</Q>&mdash; But in nothing does this &s;pirit of univer&s;al love more clearly manife&s;t it&s;elf, than in the admi&s;&s;ion of members into the &s;ociety; from which neither rich nor poor are excluded, provided they are duly qualified; i. e. <Q>are good men and true, men of honour and hone&s;ty, by whatever names, religion, or per&s;wa&s;ions they may be di&s;tingui&s;hed;</Q> which excellent in&s;titution has been a means of conciliating per&s;ons, who otherwi&s;e mu&s;t have lived (without extraordinary interpo&s;ition,) in perpetual di&s;cord and contention. In that book we are al&s;o directed <Q>to &s;peak evil of no man, to heal all differences, to
<PB N="21" REF="007370_0018_102B59CCC1AE0208">compo&s;e all animo&s;ities, and diligently and faithfully to perform all &s;ocial duties, as good husbands, good pa|rents, good &s;ons, and good neighbours.</Q>&mdash;With regard to the di&s;pen&s;ing of <HI>charity</HI> &s;o very common among us; we are governed by that <HI>apo&s;tolic</HI> rule, (which all chari|table &s;ocieties we pre&s;ume, &s;trictly ob&s;erve,) of preferring tho&s;e, who are more nearly related to us; and then indi&s;|criminately extending our relief to the nece&s;&s;itous and indigent, according to their &s;everal circum&s;tances and recommendations.</P>
<P>THIS I think &s;ufficient to &s;hew how great a regard MASONS pay to the duty of univer&s;al love. And as to other duties of morality, be it known; <Q>that profanene&s;s, and all manner of vice are de&s;tructive to the very genius of MASONRY; it is repugnant to the beauty and harmonious order of this honourable &s;ociety to ad|mit tale-bearers, bablers, or liars, litigious or quarrel&s;ome per&s;ons, habitual drunkards, enemies to religion or go|vernment among them. Nor can any member, that rightly under&s;tands, and acts agreably to his profe&s;&s;ion, be a disbeliever of GOD and his providence, or refu&s;e due honour and obedience to the King, and all that are in authority under him.</Q></P>
<P>As a civil &s;ociety, it is true, we do not pre&s;ume to meddle with the religion of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, nor con|cern
<PB N="22" REF="007370_0019_102B59CF0C7CEE10">our&s;elves with politics: To this prudence directs; we are no &s;trangers to the various tempers and di&s;po&s;itions of men; and therefore decline interfering with things of &s;o nice, &s;o delicate, and tender a nature, in which we have no right to determine, and which we very well know may create animo&s;ities, and di&s;turb the peace, union, har|mony, and love that prevails among us; upon the account of which we do rejoice, yea, and we will rejoice.&mdash;</P>
<P>IN points therefore of &s;o concerning and important a nature, every member is left to the enjoyment of his own private opinion, to the per&s;wa&s;ion of his own mind.&mdash;And I think it may not be <HI>ami&s;s to ob&s;erve</HI> upon this occa&s;ion, that the religion of the <HI>ever ble&s;&s;ed</HI> JESUS, is too &s;olemn, too &s;acred a &s;ubject to be made the topick of common conver&s;ation. To di&s;cour&s;e idly, flippantly, and incon|&s;iderately upon it, is doing it di&s;honour. Certain prepa|ration is nece&s;&s;ary to qualify us for this work; to which I fear, many of its mo&s;t zealous e&s;pou&s;ers are altogether &s;trangers.</P>
<P><Q>SUCH are the principles, &s;uch the practices, upon which this ancient &s;ociety is e&s;tabli&s;hed; &s;uch the re|gulations by which it is &s;upported, &s;uch the ends for which it i calculated; to inve&s;tigate and propagate u&s;eful knowledge; to promote, to continue unity, peace, and love, by a faithful di&s;charge of all the offi|ces
<PB N="23" REF="007370_0020_102B59D264066980">of an unfeigned charity, and generous friend&s;hip. And all the&s;e in due &s;ubordination to the mo&s;t excel|lent, and everla&s;ting precepts of the grand ma&s;ter, the glorious, the incomparable builder of the chri&s;tian church.</Q></P>
<P>WE are neither &s;o wicked, or &s;o vain, to imagine that human injunctions can carry &s;uch authority, &s;uch influ|ence, as tho&s;e that are divine; but think we are entitled to the &s;ame natural rights which all other well con&s;tituted &s;ocieties do claim, of making &s;uch laws and regulations, and even di&s;tingui&s;hing our&s;elves, by &s;ome peculiarities, that may &s;ecure our con&s;titution from violence and en|croachment; without impeachment, or reflection, without giving offence either to GOD or man.</P>
<P>AND now it might be expected, that even envy it&s;elf could find no objection to &s;o inoffen&s;ive, &s;o u&s;eful a fra|ternity! But, why &s;hould we expect to e&s;cape the cen|&s;ure, and reproach of licentious and reviling tongues; when the great, the glorious author of the chri&s;tian &s;cheme, the only begotten, the everla&s;ting SON of the FATHER, without &s;in, without guile, met with the mo&s;t violent op|po&s;ition, which cea&s;ed not but with his death, <HI>from the bands of ignorant men; as St.</HI> Peter <HI>te&s;tifies,</HI> Act. 3. 17. <HI>And now brethren, I wot, that thro' ignorance ye did it, as did al&s;o their rulers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="007370_0021_102B59D536E617A8">
LET us follow the &s;teps of this unparallelled pattern, who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he &s;uffered, he threatned not, but committed him&s;elf to him that judgeth righteou&s;ly. Such behaviour will recom|mend us to the approbation of the generous, and impar|tial; and at lea&s;t put to &s;ilence our adver&s;aries, tho' their prejudices and aver&s;ion &s;hould &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t and continue.</P>
<P>AFTER all, we are not a&s;hamed to acknowledge, that our con&s;titution is imperfect, and liable to abu&s;e; the be&s;t of human in&s;titutions is &s;o, and may &s;uffer acciden|tally in the opinion of the world thro' the indi&s;cretion of their members: But &s;urely the unworthine&s;s of an indi|vidual &s;hould never reflect di&s;honour upon a whole body, or profe&s;&s;ion of men: If &s;o, farewell chri&s;tianity, farewell the perfect and unerring law of GOD.</P>
<P><Q>THRO' the carele&s;sne&s;s and negligence of watchmen, per&s;ons of impure lives and manners may creep into our &s;ociety, and bring di&s;grace to our mo&s;t friendly &s;tructure,</Q> but candor and genero&s;ity will cea&s;e to im|pute their crimes to us, when we openly renounce, and bear te&s;timony again&s;t them.</P>
<P>AND may You RIGHT WORSHIPFUL (to whom the in|&s;pection and care of the lodges in <HI>North-America</HI> are &s;o &s;afely intru&s;ted) be directed to the mo&s;t effectual me|thods of guarding again&s;t all &s;uch impo&s;itions; may you
<PB N="25" REF="007370_0022_102B9439ED816230">fall upon &s;uch expedients (in conjunction with the wor|&s;hipful ma&s;ters and wardens of the &s;everal lodges) as may not only improve and perpetuate MASONRY, but al&s;o &s;uppre&s;s all immoralities (if any &s;uch prevail or &s;ub&s;i&s;t among us) in conformity to the mo&s;t excellent and unex|ceptionable pattern on the Mount; which pre&s;cribes the mo&s;t equitable and whol&s;ome rules of living: In a ju&s;t ob&s;ervation of which, MASONS will undoubtedly <HI>&s;quare</HI> all their actions aright, and bring their pa&s;&s;ions upon a <HI>level</HI> with the excellent rules that are there laid down. "Then may we expect to ta&s;te and &s;ee, how good the LORD is." For the practice of religion may well be compared to the river of the P&s;almi&s;t; <HI>the &s;treams whereof make glad the city of</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>AND to you my well re&s;pected BRETHREN, a few words of ADDRESS may not be improper.&mdash;<HI>Let love be without di&s;&s;imulation;</HI> let it be extended to all men, without regard to party di&s;putes, or religious differences; and let this important truth be frequent in your thoughts; that before the almighty JUDGE, all mu&s;t &s;tand or fall, according to their works, with or without our cen&s;ure.&mdash; U&s;e the ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven with temperance and mode|ration; &s;et bounds to your plea&s;ures, and avoid all man|ner of exce&s;s: Let all &s;pots and blemi&s;hes be ab&s;ent from your meetings, more particularly from the entertainment provided for our pre&s;ent refre&s;hment: And as our a&s;&s;em|bly

<P>AND &s;hall I be condemned! Will it now be thought improper! at the conclu&s;ion of a di&s;cour&s;e calculated to promote univer&s;al love, and withal to di&s;play the affectio|nate tender regard that the brethren of this &s;ociety are pre&s;umed to bear to one another: I &s;ay, can it be thought improper to manife&s;t the thing in fact, by dropping a few tears on the grave, and doing &s;ome ju&s;tice to the memory of a departed brother; I mean the Rev. Mr. Charles Brothwell.&mdash;A few words upon the occa&s;ion, will not, I flatter my&s;elf, be thought impertinent or tedious; (altho' I am &s;en&s;ible I have &s;ufficiently tre&s;pa&s;s'd on your pati|ence already) For I know he was dear to &s;ome of you, in the &s;everal capacities of a good man, a good chri&s;tian, a faithful pa&s;tor, and I will add upon the account of the craft (however my&s;terious it may be!) as a good MASON.</P>
<P>HE was an hone&s;t and an orthodox man, noted for his zeal, which was according to knowledge; a workman that needed not to be a&s;hamed, rightly dividing the word of truth; boldly rebuking vice, and e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of the GOD of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> upon all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>WHETHER we have re&s;pect to the faith, the life, the doctrine of our departed brother, we &s;hall find cau&s;e to
<PB N="27" REF="007370_0024_102B943DE811F328">glorify GOD, and to comfort our&s;elves with a well|grounded hope, that he &s;till continues to live in CHRIST; the &s;ouls of the righteous are in the hands of GOD.&mdash; His views were not earthly; his trea&s;ure, his heart was in heaven; &s;o that when the alarming &s;ummons came (as I have been credibly informed) he di&s;covered no reluc|tance in obeying it, but patiently &s;ubmitted to the &s;troke, with hopes full of immortality, and a joyful expectation of a glorious re&s;urrection.&mdash;Let us not lament then, but congratulate one another upon the glorious exchange our brother has made: He is parted from us for a while, but we may meet again in Glory. In the mean time, Let us &s;hew our regard and affection to him, by extending our pity, compa&s;&s;ion and charity to the di&s;tre&s;t Relict, who addre&s;&s;es us in the words of one of the wives of the &s;ons of the Prophets; 2 Kings 4. 6. <HI>Thy &s;ervant my husband is dead, and thou knowe&s;t that thy &s;ervant did &s;erve the</HI> LORD.&mdash;Take the ca&s;e into con&s;ideration; remember the hands that have been lifted up at the altar: Lay up for your&s;elves trea&s;ures in Heaven, by extending your chri&s;tian benevolence to the widow of your pa&s;tor, and your brother.</P>
<P>Now to GOD the FATHER, GOD the SON, and GOD the HOLY GHOST, be a&s;cribed all power, glory, might, maje&s;ty, and dominion, now and for evermore.</P>
