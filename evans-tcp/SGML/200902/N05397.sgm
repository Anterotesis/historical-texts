<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS a Piece of fa&s;hionable Mode&s;ty for an Author to &s;peak meanly of his own Performance; and commonly looked upon as a meer complimental Formality, or an Artifice to gain Applau&s;e. Humility is an amiable Virtue in the Eyes of All; and Self-Di&s;commendation, with a View to that Character, is an agree|able Piece of Self-Denial, even to an ambitious Mind. But the critical and impartial Reader will &s;oon di&s;cover &s;o many Imperfec|tions in the following Poems, that he can hardly &s;u&s;pect my Sinceri|ty when I a&s;&s;ure him, That it is not without Blu&s;hing and Diffi|dence I yield to the Importunity of &s;ome of my Friends, to pre&s;ent them to public View. And as to tho&s;e who&s;e friendly Partiality may cover, or who&s;e Want of Ta&s;te may render them in&s;en&s;ible of the&s;e Imperfections; all Apology is needle&s;s.</P>
<P>Sundry of the&s;e Poems were fortuitous Productions, formed with|out any previous De&s;ign, and upon no &s;pecial Occa&s;ions. Some of them were intended only as private Memorials of &s;ome Meditati|ons or Occurrences that appeared to me worthy to be retained; and I could think of no more agreeable Method to &s;ecure them from Oblivion. Others were written at the Impul&s;e of &s;ome &s;prightly Thought, that perhaps was accidently &s;ugge&s;ted to my Mind, and allured me to pur&s;ue it. Others to improve a vacant Hour on Sa|turday Evening after Study; and to give me a more lively Impre&s;|&s;ion of the Subject of Di&s;cour&s;e for the en&s;uing Day. Others as profitable Amu&s;ements, and Relaxations from &s;everer Studies. And others to gratify a natural Poetic Ta&s;te, or (that I may not give it
<PB N="iv" REF="006834_0003_102A60405CF70230">too high a Name) a ver&s;ifying Humour: And probably this was the origional Spring of my improving the other Occa&s;ion, in this Manner.</P>
<P>I was at length determined, tho' not without &s;ome remaining Diffidence, to &s;elect the following out of &s;undry others which will probably lie by we in perpetual Oblivion, and con&s;ent to their Pub|lication; and my Rea&s;ons may be collected from what follows.</P>
<P>There is in almo&s;t all Mankind <HI>an innate Love of Harmony,</HI> which gives tho&s;e Things that are conveyed to their Minds in a poetical Vehicle a peculiar Reli&s;h. This <HI>harmonious Turn of Mind</HI> is the Stamp of Heaven, the Image of the eternal Author of Or|der; and 'tis He that teaches us to feel the Charms of Poetry:
<Q><L><HI>"From Harmony to Harmony we ri&s;e,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"To that &s;uperior Skill which turn'd the Spheres;</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Gave Melody to</HI> Gabriel<HI>'s heav'nly Lyre,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"And every moving Grace to</HI> Milton<HI>'s Song.</HI></L>

<L><HI>"The dying Strain that calms the wilde&s;t Care,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Or loftier Note that prompts to glorious Deeds,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Th' in&s;piring GOD dwells in the my&s;tic Sound,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"And charms and captivates the li&s;t'ning Soul,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Thro' all her &s;oft Capacities of Joy.</HI>

<P>Something corre&s;pondent to this appears in the <HI>Order</HI> and Adju&s;t|ment of the <HI>inanimate Creation;</HI> and hence proceeds much of out Plea&s;ure in the Contemplation of the Works of God.</P>

<P>And no doubt <HI>this,</HI> as well as the other Powers and natural Gu&s;ts of the human Mind, was given for valuable Purpo&s;es; and ought to be improven as an agreeable Avenue for the Introduction of Divine Things:</P>
<P>'Tis true, it is not equally vigorous in Per&s;ons of different Con|&s;titutions and Education. It admits of Improvement, as well as the other Faculties of the Soul; and the Di&s;parity will appear ac|cording to the Strength of the innate Principle, and the Degrees of Cultivation:

<P>Per&s;ons of a refined and judicious Ta&s;te are con&s;cious of peculiar Sen&s;ations, when they meet with Entertainment &s;uitable to them. They take but little Notice of tho&s;e trifling Appendages of Poetry, which are the mo&s;t agreeable to Per&s;ons of a coar&s;e Reli&s;h; as the Jingling of Syllables, the Equality of Numbers, the ambiguous Punn, or witty Turn: But they are captivated with the lively Images of Fancy, the Grandeur of Ideas, the Flowers of Language, the Pomp of Style, and the proper Arangement of well-di&s;po&s;ed Pe|riods. Such Readers are imaginary <HI>Actors</HI> of all the Scenes of the Poet's Imagination; and a <HI>Genius</HI> that can write as well as
<PB N="vi" REF="006834_0005_102A60464B566B88"><HI>they</HI> can read, has an entire Dominion over their Pa&s;&s;ions. So Dr. <HI>Evans</HI> addre&s;&s;es Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> on his Tran&s;lation of <HI>Homer:</HI>
<Q><L><HI>"At Will the Ma&s;ter with our Pa&s;&s;ions plays,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Our Hopes, our Fears, our Joy, our Grief can rai&s;e;</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Cha&s;es, retrieves, with Ea&s;e their Force controuls</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Thro' all the &s;ecret Windings of our Souls.</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Now we attack, and now we routed fly;</HI></L>
<L><HI>"And in thy Song by turns we live and die.&mdash;</HI></L>
<L><HI>"The direful Tumult of the Slaught'ring Fight</HI></L>
<L><HI>"So well you image, and record &s;o right,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"My Fury kindles while the Ver&s;e I read,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"And Fancy acts each bold heroic Deed."</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Sublime Poetry is to &s;uch a Series of Tran&s;ports; and flat and dull, is utterly intolerable; they &s;icken at the Sight: As nice Pa|lates have a more lively Reli&s;h of an agreeable Di&s;h, and a &s;tronger Di&s;gu&s;t to what is nau&s;eous, than Per&s;ons of a coar&s;er Ta&s;te. And as their Plea&s;ure is more refined; &s;o it is more rare; they are of|fended where others are plea&s;ed, and nau&s;eate what others reli&s;h. None but an <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil,</HI> a <HI>Milton</HI> or <HI>Pope,</HI> can furni&s;h them with proper Entertainment. And may there always be &s;ome exalted <HI>Genius</HI> to profit and plea&s;e &s;uch delicate Minds, and refine them for cele&s;tial Plea&s;ures, which alone can &s;atisfy their &s;ublime A&s;pi|rations!&mdash;But I am convinced by a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my Incapa|city, that this does not belong to my Province. If any &s;uch &s;hould be &s;o curious as to look into the following Poems, and receive them with but <HI>cold</HI> Approbation; I &s;hall gratefully acknowledge it as an In&s;tance of a generous Candour of Ta&s;te. Or if they lay them a&s;ide, I hope they will do it with that Di&s;po&s;ition which we di&s;|cover towards the over-officious Attempts of impotent Benevolence; or with that Calmne&s;s and Indifferency with which we reject Things that were not intended for our Entertainment or Mole&s;tation, but belong wholly to Others.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="006834_0006_102A604959A064F0">
But there are few among us of this Character; as there are but few that can write for their Entertainment. And to con&s;ult the Advantage of &s;uch only, is as unrea&s;onable as if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Legi&s;lature &s;hould tolerate none but &s;ilken Manufactures. The Ge|nerality of Mankind have neither Opportunity nor perhaps Capacity for the&s;e Refinements; and yet are capable of a glorious Immorta|lity, and the purer Joys of Paradi&s;e.&mdash;For the Sake of &s;uch I write; and to &s;ome of them my E&s;&s;ays will not be unacceptable. They may not accurately di&s;cern the faire&s;t Charms of Poetry; yet they generally are plea&s;ed with the Con&s;onance of final Syllables, pro|portioned Numbers, &amp;c. So that they are more ready to receive and retain tho&s;e Things which are conveyed into their Minds in this Form than in heavy and tire&s;ome Pro&s;e: For (if the modern Ta&s;te will pardon a Citation out of that antiquated divine Wit, <HI>Herbert.</HI>)</P>
<Q><L><HI>"A Ver&s;e may hit him whom a Sermon flies,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"And turn Delight into a Sacrifice."</HI></L></Q>
<P>On this Account I have frequently thought the Divine Art of Po|etry might be made peculiarly &s;ub&s;ervient to the Intere&s;ts of Religion and Virtue; and lamented the common Pro&s;titution of the heavenly mu&s;e to the meane&s;t and mo&s;t wicked Purpo&s;es: 'Tis certainly a Sacrilege that Heaven will avenge; and which la&s;civious Wits will at la&s;t regret. Many of the Conque&s;ts of Vice have been owing to this Abu&s;e. This has cloathed her in the mo&s;t fallacious Charms; and given the Mon&s;ter a <HI>Syren</HI>'s Voice, to enchant the Unthinking into Ruin. And if we can make Reprizals, and allure Men to the amiable Glories of Holine&s;s, by the proper U&s;e of that Art, which &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully allured them to embrace even the horrid Charms of Sin; it will be a glorious Enterprize. And may Almighty Grace di&s;po&s;e tho&s;e whom Nature has animated with this &s;acred Fire, to kindle it on the Divine Altar! There it glows with the brighte&s;t Lu&s;tre; and 'tis a Pity it &s;hould wa&s;te it&s;elf away in pe&s;ti&s;erous Fumes in the Temple of Vice and Impiety.</P>
<P>There are thou&s;ands to attempt the Reformation of Mankind in other more common, and therefore le&s;s plea&s;ing Ways; while there
<PB N="viii" REF="006834_0007_102A604B6CE9F878">are but few qualified to attempt it in this; and therefore tho&s;e that are ble&s;t with the lea&s;t Spark of poetic Fire ought not to &s;uf|focate it.</P>
<P>This is the more nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince among the numberle&s;s poetical Preductions obtruded on the pre&s;ent Age, there is not, in my Opi|nion, a becoming Proportion of <HI>Sacred</HI> Poetry. Many indeed have done much Service to the World, and embalmed their Names to Po&s;terity, by their valuable Performances of this Kind. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has given us a Specimen of his Genius for it in his <HI>Sacred Eclogue,</HI> intituled <HI>MESSIAH,</HI> and in &s;undry Parts of his <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Man.</HI> A very agreeable Spirit of Devotion breathes through Mr. <HI>Thom|&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Sea&s;ons,</HI> and the <HI>Night-Thoughts.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Commonly attributed to Dr.</HI> Young.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> has been of &s;ingular Service by his many Divine Compo&s;ures; and I think Sir <HI>R. Blackmore</HI> may be here mentioned with Re&s;pect, notwith&s;tanding the In&s;ults of &s;ome &s;uperior Wits&mdash;Many others might be added to the Li&s;t: But after all, (not to ob&s;erve that &s;ome of the&s;e &s;oar above the Populace) Any One that is ver&s;ant in modern Poetry will find Rea&s;on to complain, that it is too commonly &s;unk to trivial, and &s;ometimes prophane Subjects; and but &s;eldom a&s;&s;umes tho&s;e Glories with which it &s;hines, when employ'd on Sacred Themes.&mdash;When &s;hall the Divine Fires of Poetry and Devotion flame unitedly to Heaven, and diffu&s;e cele&s;tial Fervour through the World!</P>
<P>I do not mean that the Mu&s;e &s;hould be <HI>wholly</HI> confin'd to <HI>&s;acred</HI> Things. 'Tis only for a <HI>Proportion</HI> I plead. She might recre|ate her&s;elf in a thou&s;and Excur&s;ions through the Credtions of Fan|cy; but let her &s;ea&s;onably return to the more important Themes &s;he left. War might &s;till thunder in awful Numbers; and Kings and Horbes be immortaliz'd in Song. Wit may exert her&s;elf in the various Forms of Ridicule and Satyr, to expo&s;e Vice, or the le&s;&s;er Foibles of Mankind; and the tender Pa&s;&s;ions may &s;igh their Sor|rows, or breathe their Joys, in the mo&s;t harmonious Lays.&mdash;But &s;hall <HI>Mortals</HI> live forever in poetical Monuments, and <HI>THE KING OF KINGS</HI> be un&s;ung?

But to return.&mdash;Of tho&s;e valuable Tracts of &s;acred Ver&s;e which are extant, there are but very few in this Colony in the Hands of common People; and in &s;uch a Famine, perhaps the&s;e coar&s;e Provi&s;ions may not be di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>I may add, as another Rea&s;on of this Publication, that there are but few perhaps of a public Character but what are of &s;ome Importance in the Circle of their Friends or Pari&s;honers; who would therefore read their Writings with more Attention and Regard than tho&s;e of Others that are much more valuable. As this favourable Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion furni&s;hes &s;uch with particular Opportunities of doing Good in their re&s;pective Spheres; they &s;hould improve it for that Purpo&s;e.

<P>Yet, that the Advantage may not be limited to my own Denomi|nation, I have form'd the&s;e Poems upon the Footing of catholic Chri&s;tianity; and avoided all the little angry Peculiarities of a Party: And indeed this was ea&s;y, even without explicitly de&s;igning it, while I was &s;itting peaceful in my Study, benevolent to all Man|kind, wi&s;hing the riche&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings to the Church of CHRIST in every Denomination, unruffled with the Irritations, and unmindful of the Bigotry and Party-Conte&s;ts of the jangling World.

It may be expedient to premi&s;e the&s;e few Remarks to reflect Light on the Poems, and prepare the Reader for their Peru&s;al.</P>
<P>They are a Collection of <HI>Mi&s;cellanies;</HI> not dige&s;ted into Order according to the Nature of the Subjects: For I was apprehen&s;ive a confu&s;ed Variety would be more entertaining.</P>
<P>Though the <HI>Date</HI> of a Poem be generally an in&s;ignificant Circum|&s;tance to the Reader; yet I thought it expedient to annex <HI>That</HI> and the <HI>Text</HI> to the Title of the Poems connected with my public Di&s;|cour&s;es; that they might be a Hint to my Hearers to help them to recollect the Di&s;cour&s;es them&s;elves; and when it is done in &s;ome other Ca&s;es, I think it needs no Apology.</P>
<P>I have generally u&s;ed that <HI>Metre</HI> which is mo&s;t familiar and plain to common Capacities: And where I have indulged my&s;elf to imitate the <HI>Heroic</HI> Numbers of <HI>Milton,</HI> or the noble <HI>Licence</HI> of <HI>Pindar</HI> (the la&s;t of which is perhaps mo&s;t natural to me) it was for the mo&s;t Part before I had any Intention of publi&s;hing them.</P>
<P>I have &s;crupulou&s;ly avoided tho&s;e <HI>Invocations of fabulous Deitles,</HI> &s;o common in many of our modern Poets. Nor can the Veneration I have for &s;undry of tho&s;e that embelli&s;h their Poems with them, convince me that it is an irrational Scrupuo&s;ity. I &s;uppo&s;e they would not de&s;ire to be counted <HI>&s;incere</HI> in their Devotions; and I think <HI>hypocritical</HI> Devotion, even to a ficticious Deity, is odious. It &s;eems at lea&s;t an <HI>Affectation</HI> of Idolatry, without the lea&s;t Temp|tation. Who, that knew it not before, would &s;u&s;pect tho&s;e Poets to be profe&s;t Chri&s;tians, who begin, and end, and intermix their Poems with &s;o many warm Petitions, or rapturous Ejaculations to <HI>Apollo,</HI> to <HI>Jove,</HI> to <HI>Venus,</HI> to <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and the whole Rabble of Heatheni&s;h Gods? E&s;pecially when their Devotion to the&s;e &s;eems to flame out more frequently than to the GOD that made the Heavens. The Ground of their Error, I conceive, is this, That they cannot imitate or equallize the Antients without adopting their &s;uper&s;titious, non|&s;en&s;ical and impious Theology (for &s;uch that of the Poets generally was.)

<HEAD>XII. <HI>The univer&s;al Lamentation.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though I freely own, it requires a more exalted Mu&s;e than mine to manage this tender Subject with &s;uitable Pathos and Energy; yet I hope None will cen&s;ure the Matter and Scope of the Poem, as &s;avour|ing of fanatical Affectation.&mdash;That the human Soul, tho' the imme|diate Progeny of the uncreated <HI>Paternal Mind,</HI> (as even a <HI>Heathen</HI> could &s;tile Him) is now &s;urprizingly alienated from its Divine Parent; indi&s;|po&s;ed for the exalted Purpo&s;es of its Exi&s;tence; and under the Tyranny of ignoble Appetites, and criminal Pa&s;&s;ions; is a lamentable Truth we mu&s;t a&s;&s;ent to, unle&s;s we deny our own quicke&s;t and mo&s;t deep-felt men|tal Sen&s;ations.&mdash;And that Many indulge them&s;elves in this Depravity, without any eager A&s;piration for the Reparation of their noble Nature, now in Ruins; and make it the main Bu&s;ine&s;s of this mortal Life, to obey the groveling Dictates, and gratify the impetuous Lu&s;ts, of a dege|nerate Soul; we are ungratefully con&s;trained to believe, by the odious Scenes of Impiety and Prophanene&s;s, that open round us, and impor|tunately intrude upon our Ob&s;ervation, however willingly we would &s;hun them.&mdash;And can there be any Thing &s;o moving, any Thing &s;o ju&s;t an Object for manly Sorrow, as this? It cannot be ju&s;tly looked upon as an In&s;tance of effeminate Softne&s;s, for the mo&s;t exalted and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Mind, to di&s;&s;olve into the tendere&s;t Sorrows, when it is our common Humanity that demands the &s;ympathi&s;ing Fear, and prompts the lamenting Groan. The Dignity of the human Soul,&mdash;the expen&s;ive and Endearing Mea&s;ures a gracious GOD has been plea&s;ed to take for its Recovery,&mdash;the ineffable Glories forfeited, and the intole|rable Mi&s;eries incurr'd, by an ob&s;tinate Continuance in Sin,&mdash;and a thou&s;and other Con&s;iderations, render this Degeneracy peculiarly la|mentable.&mdash;And may it not therefore be pertinently improven, as the Occa&s;ion for an <HI>Univer&s;al Lamentation?</HI> 'Tis natural for a Mind full of tender and vigorous Pa&s;&s;ions to fall into <HI>Pro&s;opopaeia's,</HI> and to call the inanimate Creation to &s;hare its Sen&s;ations. Nothing is more common in Pa&s;&s;ions of Joy and Gratitude; both in &s;acred and prophane Wri|ters. Of this the 148 <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> the Mattin-Song of our fir&s;t Parents, ac|cording to <HI>Milton, Thom&s;on</HI>'s Hymn annext to the Sea&s;ons, and that &s;urprizing <HI>Apo&s;trophe</HI> in I&s;ai. lxix. 13. are very noble In&s;tances. Thus al&s;o the mournful Pa&s;&s;ions frequently vent them&s;elves, upon various Occa&s;ions; and why may they not on this, the mo&s;t Mournful of all? &mdash;St. <HI>Paul</HI> (Rom. viii. 19, 22.) forms a moving <HI>Pro&s;opopaeia</HI> on the Subject of this Poem, with Energy of Language which no Tran&s;lation can reach.&mdash;The whole Creation burfts into an united Groan, and labours with travailing Pangs, ever &s;ince Sin reduced it into Slavery, and &s;ubjected it to Vanity; and will continue to do &s;o, 'til it partake of the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God.&mdash;And this In&s;tance, not to mention a Variety of others, is a &s;ufficient Precedent to vindicate the Scope of this Poem.&mdash;'Tis certain, if Sin were more lamented, it would be le&s;s indulged and practi&s;ed in the World. And if <HI>Cicero,</HI> con|&s;idering the <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> Evils of Life could &s;ay, <HI>(Hoec quidem Vita Mors e&s;t, quam lamentari po&s;&s;em.</HI> (Tu&s;c. Di&s;put. L. I.) "This Life is truly Death, which I could lament"; &s;ure, when we &s;urvey the <HI>moral</HI> Evils that ruin the immortal Mind, we may breathe out <HI>Jeremiah</HI>'s pa&s;&s;ionate Wi&s;h, <HI>Oh that mike Head were Waters! and mine Eyes Fountains of Tears!</HI> (Jer. ix. 1.)</NOTE></HEAD>
