<PB N="6" REF="008702_0005_102FBA259D77CAF0">Haughtine&s;s of our inveterate Foes has been co|vered by him with Shame and Confu&s;ion; and if, regardle&s;s of his Cha&s;ti&s;ements, they per&s;i&s;t in wick|ed De&s;igns, in perfidious Dealings, in violent Mea|&s;ures, he will &s;urely level all their a&s;piring Thoughts with the Du&s;t, and cru&s;h into Abortion their de|&s;tructive Machinations.</P>
<P>WE have always, and now more e&s;pecially, ju&s;t Rea&s;on to let Prai&s;es and Thank&s;givings dwell on our Lips, and in our Minds, for the &s;ingular Mercies it has plea&s;ed God to &s;hew us. Let us therefore rai&s;e the Voice of Exultation, let us &s;ound the Trumpet of Prai&s;e, let us pay the Tribute of Thanks to the Mo&s;t High. This our Felicity, next to, and under the Direction of his all-gracious providential Care, we are indebted for to his Ma|je&s;ty's wi&s;e Councils, which the Event has proved to have been planned with a judicious Foreca&s;t, and executed with a no le&s;s noble than vigor|ous Spirit. It was the&s;e wi&s;e Councils that made Choice of General JAMES WOLFE for the Conque&s;t of <HI>Quebec,</HI> the Capital of the <HI>French</HI> Empire in <HI>North-America.</HI> He did not he&s;itate to obey his Orders, or cavil with his In&s;tructions; his Country called him forth; he went, fought the Enemy, and died crowned with Victory.</P>
<P>HERE, what a Scene, mingled with Glory and Pity, Joy and Sorrow, Triumph and Mourning, pre&s;ents it&s;elf to View!</P>
<P>How glorious was it for a &s;mall Body of Troops, amid&s;t a Multiplicity of Ob&s;tacles, almo&s;t un&s;ur|mountable, to defeat &s;o numerous an Enemy; and
<PB N="7" REF="008702_0006_102FBA27278DC738">yet we pity that Bravery, that Ardour, that Incen|tive to Honour, that Sen&s;e of Duty, that Love of the Country in the noble Commander; becau&s;e, as the moving Spring to animate others with Motion, as the powerful Example begun and &s;hewn in him&s;elf to lead on to Conque&s;t, he was thereby prompted to hazard and lo&s;e a Life &s;o precious to his Country!</P>
<P>HARK! what Shouts of Joy rend the Sky whil&s;t <HI>Britons</HI> cry VICTORY! The neighbouring Moun|tains &s;end back the Sound! <HI>Quebec</HI> hears it, chilled with Horrors; the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations &s;tand a&s;toni&s;h|ed: But alas! this Joy, &s;o full of Confu&s;ion for the Enemy; &s;o &s;weet a Source of Plea&s;ure for <HI>Britons,</HI> is &s;oon marred with Bitterne&s;s. <HI>Britons</HI> &s;ee, with Sorrow painted on their down-ca&s;t Faces, their General breathing his la&s;t; they count over, with Regret, his honourable Wounds; and while they bathe them with their Tears, they cannot help thinking, that, that Victory mu&s;t be ine&s;tima|ble, which required for its Purcha&s;e the Blood of &s;o great and &s;o good a General.</P>
<P>Lo! Triumphs were not wanting, to declare the Importance of our Conque&s;t. They were not, indeed, tho&s;e Triumphs that dazzle the Sight, by the Splendor of an external &s;olemn Pomp; but they were Triumphs in the Heart of every true <HI>Briton,</HI> and every &s;incere Wi&s;her to the Welfare of his Country. Our <HI>North-American</HI> Colonies had long experienced all the Inconveniences of a more than trouble&s;ome Neighbourhood; they were delivered up, by an encroaching and rapacious Enemy, to the Incur&s;ions and Depredations of the
<PB N="8" REF="008702_0007_102FBA2E77584A08">mo&s;t barbarous Savages: Let us draw a Veil over the Treatment they received, over the uncommon Cruelties exerci&s;ed upon them; Humanity cannot &s;tand the Shock of a bare Repre&s;entation! What mu&s;t be their Thoughts when the welcome News came to them of the Conque&s;t of <HI>Quebec?</HI> All their Fears were di&s;&s;ipated; the certain Hopes of future Peace and Security &s;miled upon them; every Brea&s;t glowed with Triumph. <HI>Britain,</HI> a fond Parent, felt the warm Emotions of the dear Chil|dren &s;he had nurtured and educated with &s;o much Care. How deeply was &s;he, &s;ome Time ago, afflicted to learn their Di&s;tre&s;s? She rode on the rapid Wings of Tenderne&s;s to their Relief; her potent Arm rai&s;ed them up; it bade them follow to the Revenge of Battle; and now &s;he exults with them in Triumph. O great and glorious Triumph, how magnificent would&s;t thou have been, were the Triumphs of mortal Man, pure, un&s;ullied, and unmixed! Thy Brightne&s;s is ob|&s;cured, thy Beauties fade, they Gaiety grows &s;ullen, when the Reflection &s;tarts upon us, di&s;mal and doleful Reflection! proclaiming aloud, that WOLFE is dead; WOLFE! that valiant Captain, who&s;e au&s;picious Conduct is the Cau&s;e of all our Tri|umph. Then, O then, the Eye is &s;een to mourn; the Countenance in vain recals its Sprightline&s;s; nay, the whole Body, to &s;hew it &s;ympathizes with the &s;incere Regret of the Mind, would willingly clothe it&s;elf with a Garb expre&s;&s;ive of Sorrow!</P>
<P>BUT cea&s;e, ye unavailing Tears! Cea&s;e to flow! Ye flow without Rea&s;on! WOLFE is not dead. He now enjoys a Life of Immortality. His Me|mory will be for ever dear to <HI>Britons.</HI> Heaven,
<PB N="9" REF="008702_0008_102FBA3006146580">&s;umming up his heroic Virtues, judged them to be ripe for the Fruition of eternal Happine&s;s. Yes, O Divine Being, Author of all good Gifts! <HI>He</HI>
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxi. ver. 4, 5.</NOTE> <HI>a&s;ked Life of thee, and thou gave&s;t it him, even Length of Days for ever and ever: His Glory is great in thy Salvation, Honour and Maje&s;ty ha&s;t thou laid upon him.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH are the ineffable Rewards that await Vir|tue; &s;uch General JAMES WOLFE is now in the quiet and undi&s;turbed Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of; he now &s;its exalted above the Reach of impotent Envy, which cannot detract from his Merit; and this his Merit will appear in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous and amiable Light, after pa&s;&s;ing in Review the principal Ac|tions of his Life.</P>
<P>JAMES WOLFE has a ju&s;t Claim to very honour|able Progenitors. He was the Son of Colonel EDWARD WOLFE, and was born at <HI>We&s;terham,</HI> in the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> where he was bapti&s;ed <HI>January</HI> the 11th, 1726. It is &s;aid of him, that, even in his earlie&s;t Youth, he had by Words and Actions exhibited &s;everal Specimens of what he was one Day likely to be: So true it is, that the natural Di&s;po&s;ition will work its Way, and &s;hew it&s;elf in the Di&s;play of ingenious Contrivances, when the Application of Art and Precepts, where it is wanting, will have little or no Effect. His illu&s;trious Parents, who could ea&s;ily di&s;cern in him the Dawn of great Hopes, were a&s;&s;iduous to im|prove it into the Maturity of &s;trong, bright, and vivid Rays. Every Thing in young WOLFE con|tributed to &s;econd their Intentions; he not only
<PB N="10" REF="008702_0009_102FBA338EB2FC38">performed whatever he was enjoined with all the Alacrity of Inclination, but even his Performance was admirable; and the more &s;o, as it far exceed|ed his Years. Happy Genius! de&s;tined by &s;uch evident Marks to be the Support and Ornament of your Country.</P>
<P>THESE were only the Rudiments and E&s;&s;ays of tender Childhood: The Flower was &s;till in the Bud; it only gli&s;tened bedecked with the Pearls of Morning Dew. But, when once its native ge|nial Warmth began to tran&s;mit the generous Sap, it opened, it blowed, into all the Charms of Adole&s;cency. Now we behold young WOLFE, not in&s;en&s;ibly, but, by a bri&s;k and lively Progre&s;s, learning and practi&s;ing all the Duties, and all the Virtues, that &s;pread their Lu&s;tre on a well-in&s;tituted Life. His Apprehen&s;ion was exceeding quick and clear, penetrating almo&s;t in a Moment into the deepe&s;t Rece&s;&s;es of whatever was nece&s;&s;ary for him to know: His Judgment, acute and &s;olid, readily determined him in the Choice of what was be&s;t; and his Memory, ea&s;y and retentive, laid up for his U&s;e, as in a faithful Repo&s;itory, all his precious Acqui&s;itions. Society, as in a Mirrour, could con|template in him all the Perfections that tend to in|hance its Benefit. His Friend&s;hips were the more &s;incere and con&s;tant, as being cemented on the Groundwork of Rea&s;on; yet not &s;o re&s;trained to the Sweets of particular Attachments, as ever to exclude a more exten&s;ive Spirit of Benevolence, which glow|ed in him, to promote the univer&s;al Good of Man|kind. Hence he was polite, affable, gentle, free, and unre&s;erved in his Conver&s;ation; no &s;tiff, &s;ullen, for|bidding, haughty, boi&s;terous Airs ruffled the Sere|nity
<PB N="11" REF="008702_0010_102FBA3513C20B60">of his Countenance; and, as his Graces were truly engaging, actuated by Honour, replete with Candour, devoid of Affectation, &s;o none ever refu&s;ed him the kinde&s;t Wi&s;hes of their Hearts.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e &s;ocial Virtues, and many others which might be enumerated, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, even in tho&s;e Years, that Purity and Integrity of Mind, which made him on all Occa&s;ions adhere &s;trictly to the Dictates of Ju&s;tice, and withal in&s;pired him with &s;uch a deep Sen&s;e of Religion, that the good Chri&s;tian did not &s;eem &s;o much added to, as to crown and complete the Uniformity of his Conduct. And, indeed, it was this Sen&s;e of Religion that im|parted Spirit and Motion; nay, I may &s;ay, covered with the Shield of Intrepidity, and fitted the Wings of Impetuo&s;ity to, the Courage which afterwards appeared in his military Character. He was tho|roughly convinced within him&s;elf, that he who is regardle&s;s of his Duty to God, will be but a &s;uper|ficial Ob&s;erver of his Duty to his Country and Prince. The Officer who&s;e Vigour of Mind and Body is ema&s;culated by Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, who&s;e Ap|petites reli&s;h nothing but Immoralities, cannot look at an Enemy in the Face: He either flies, betray|ing the da&s;tardly Spirit of a Coward; or, over|whelmed by all the Horrors of con&s;cious Guilt, kneels, deprecating the Vengeance of the uplift|ed Arm ready to &s;trike the fatal Blow: Where|as the Chri&s;tian Soldier, who complies with his Duty, not by Nece&s;&s;ity, but by Choice; not through the &s;ervile Fear of Reproach, but for the Welfare and Glory of his Country, is not aba&s;hed to meet his Foe; he is &s;eized with no Horrors of Con&s;cience to make him grovel in Timidity; his Mind is e|rect,
<PB N="12" REF="008702_0011_102FBA3697E87008">&s;teady, and active; no Difficulties can ob|&s;truct his victorious Sword, nor no Dangers deter him from executing the Purpo&s;e of his Soul.</P>
<P>ALL the Actions of WOLFE expre&s;&s;ed this Pour|trait of the Chri&s;tian Soldier, from the very Time he embraced the Profe&s;&s;ion of Arms, which was &s;o early as when he was but ju&s;t able to bear them. Eager to receive In&s;truction, punctual to obey Command, a&s;&s;iduous to form him&s;elf and others to all the Exactne&s;s of military Di&s;cipline, he &s;oon merited the E&s;teem of his Equals, and was ho|noured with the Commendations of his Superiors. How wonderfully does Prai&s;e operate on an ingen|uous Mind! It is its Sting, its Spur, its Fire; it rou&s;es, it pu&s;hes on, it inflames the whole Man to atchieve the mo&s;t gallant Exploits: Yet WOLFE, though &s;en&s;ible of it, was far from being puffed up with vain Pride: Prai&s;e may flatter others with the Thoughts of Self-&s;ufficiency, with an over Confi|dence in their Abilities; but in him its Effects were only predominant to the Out-doing of him|&s;elf in &s;till greater and more &s;pirited Acts.</P>
<P>DURING the la&s;t War he was pre&s;ent at almo&s;t every Engagement, in which he bore no incon&s;i|derable Part, &s;ignali&s;ing his Courage by vigorous Attacks upon the Enemy, and frequently his Con|duct, in a very ma&s;terly Manner, amid&s;t Dangers and Difficulties. No Wonder, then, if his military Genius was &s;ingled out, as one that promi&s;ed to appear eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed in the fir&s;t Rank. But, whil&s;t it was thus ri&s;ing apace, admired and applauded by all, Peace lulled to Re&s;t the Horrors of War, and cut &s;hort his fond Hopes of gathering fre&s;h Laurels.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="008702_0012_102FBA3E10A4E128">
IT happens but too often, upon the Declaration of a Peace, that both the Officer and Soldier, to wear down the di&s;agreeable Impre&s;&s;ion of the many Fatigues and Hard&s;hips they underwent in the Service of the War, greedily catch at the A|mu&s;ement of every Relaxation, or rather the Bait of every Plea&s;ure that pre&s;ents it&s;elf. This In|chantment, &s;o &s;weet and ravi&s;hing in the Ta&s;te it affords, is fraught with a &s;ure though &s;low Poi&s;on. The De&s;ires are &s;timulated to a further Indulgence, and at length Habit &s;o rivets the Chains of &s;oft Dalliance, that the martial Hero, encompa&s;&s;ed by them, is &s;urprized, when called upon to exert his former Valour, that he cannot po&s;&s;ibly find him|&s;elf. Not &s;o with WOLFE. Recreation and Plea|&s;ure never &s;o prevailed over him as to make him forget what he owed to him&s;elf and to his Country. All the Nerves of his warlike Di&s;po&s;ition were kept firmly braced; and, &s;tudious to improve the important Le&s;&s;ons he had already learned into a la&s;ting Advantage, he wi&s;ely made the Ea&s;e and Lei&s;ure of Peace in&s;trumental to the cultivating of the Arts of War.</P>
<P>AND who but he could &s;o properly make War his Study? Who but he di&s;covered the mighty Genius for it? The more we take a View of this Genius, the more we &s;hall be enamoured of it: No Quality was wanting to it, which &s;eemed requi&s;ite to form and magnify the Hero. Ancient and modern Di&s;cipline were equally known to him: He united the mo&s;t &s;hining Talents of the be&s;t Ma&s;ters in the Science of War in his own Per&s;on; fully per&s;uaded, that it is not Speculation, which may be vain and idle, but Contrivance, Indu&s;try, and Application that complete the Warrior.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="008702_0013_102FBA4193D85E38">
OF this I call you to be the Witne&s;&s;es, ye &s;ix Battalions, that fought &s;o gloriou&s;ly in the Plains of <HI>Minden!</HI> All the <HI>French</HI> Cavalry felt your Shock, &s;triking down and ravaging like a Thunder-bolt. It was not a wild Force, ru&s;hing forth with preci|pitate Ra&s;hne&s;s, and often &s;pending it&s;elf in the Impetuo&s;ity of its Efforts, that broke and routed the Enemy's Squadrons; it was the Regularity and Exactne&s;s of Di&s;cipline WOLFE him&s;elf infu&s;ed in|to one of the&s;e Battalions, when he governed it as Lieutenant-Colonel. By the In&s;tinct of his Capa|city it leads the Way in that Field of Fame; the re&s;t &s;peed after the great Example: Inclination calls them to it, and Death is dealt from every Blow of the invincible Legion!</P>
<P>THIS is thy Victory, here are thy Trophies, O WOLFE! I &s;ay again it was the In&s;tinct of thy Capacity that conquered in the Plains of <HI>Minden:</HI> Thy Spirit, thy Elevation, Pre&s;ence of Mind, and Judgment were pre&s;ent at the Battle: They guid|ed the Work thy Hands had fa&s;hioned; and this Work overthrew the Enemy, with great Slaugh|ter. All <HI>Europe</HI> heard of it and was amazed! <HI>Britain</HI> knew thee, her Son, to be the Author of it, and therefore &s;he now records the Glory of this Day in her Annals to thy immortal Honour!</P>
<P>WHEN, at the Breaking-out of the pre&s;ent War, the great Mini&s;ter, who now &s;its at the Helm of Affairs, was making &s;trenuous Efforts to cut off the Hydra-Head of Faction, and to awake the na|tional Spirit from the ungrateful Slumbers it was laid in, WOLFE, fre&s;h with manly Life, appeared upon the Stage of Action, to put in Practice, for
<PB N="15" REF="008702_0014_102FBA4535B41BA0">his Country's Service, the profound Study we have &s;een him make in Peace of the Arts of War. The Mini&s;ter's di&s;cerning Eye pointed him out to be a powerful Aid to tho&s;e, who, in Right of Se|niority, claimed the Command, for executing his De&s;igns again&s;t <HI>Rochfort;</HI> though the ill Succe&s;s of that Affair gave us afterwards Rea&s;on to wi&s;h the Claim had been founded on the Right of un|di&s;puted Merit, influenced and bia&s;&s;ed by the un|feigned Love of the Country. However pure and upright the Patriot Mini&s;ter's Intentions were, it may be &s;aid, that, his Admini&s;tration being then in its Infancy, and not &s;o thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed, Feuds, Animo&s;ities, and Jealou&s;ies had not yet &s;ub&s;ided; and that there remained a Deal of the old Leaven, to corrupt the Ma&s;s of the new, yet true Sy&s;tem of Policy, if it was not purged off by due Circum&s;pection. Time alone, and a true E&s;|timate of our real Intere&s;t, can produce the&s;e de|&s;irable Effects; and it is therefore we &s;hall leave the well-projected Attack of <HI>Rochfort</HI> in the Ob|&s;curity it has been involved in, ob&s;erving only, to the
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">What is here a&s;&s;erted may be &s;een authenticated by our be&s;t Accounts.</NOTE> Honour of our young Hero, who was Quar|ter-Ma&s;ter-General upon this Expedition, that he, with other Officers, whil&s;t our Fleet remained in the Bay of <HI>Ba&s;que,</HI> the Weather being at the &s;ame Time very favourable for a De&s;cent, went on Shore one Night, and walked two Miles up the Country without Interruption. Every Part of the Beach was found by him and his Company to be firm and dry; no Encampment, no Troops, no Batteries upon it. All, upon their Return to the Fleet, pre&s;&s;ed the landing of the Troops with great

The ge|nerous Heart of WOLFE could not help te&s;tifying its Regret for &s;uch a Stagnation in Re&s;olution, which appeared but too &s;en&s;ibly: And, as he &s;in|cerely wi&s;hed well to his Country, what indignant Emotions mu&s;t have filled his Brea&s;t, to &s;ee an expen&s;ive and formidable Armament &s;erve only the Purpo&s;es of a vain Parade!

<P>ON
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>London Gazette</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 18, 1758.</NOTE> the 2d of <HI>June,</HI> 1758, when our Fleet, with about a Third of their Complement of Troops, anchored in <HI>Gabarus</HI> Bay, the gallant WOLFE, then a Brigadier-General, in Conjunction with General <HI>Amher&s;t,</HI> the Commander in Chief, and Brigadier-General <HI>Lawrence,</HI> reconnoitred the Shore as near as they could; and made a Di&s;po&s;ition for landing in three Places the next Morning, in Ca&s;e the re&s;t of the Troops arrived. The Weather continuing very bad, and the Swell of the Sea high, the Landing could not po&s;&s;ibly take Place till the 8th; at which Time Brigadier-General WOLFE was the fir&s;t that rowed into the Shore with his Detachment. The Enemy did not throw away a Shot, till his Boats were near in Shore,
<PB N="18" REF="008702_0017_102FBA545FF65B98">and then directed the whole Fire of their Cannon and Mu&s;quetry upon them. Notwith&s;tanding their Fire, and the Violence of the Surf, which made it almo&s;t impracticable to find a Place for getting a Boat on Shore, Brigadier WOLFE pur&s;u|ed his Point; and, landing ju&s;t at the Left of the Cove, took Po&s;t, attacked the Enemy, and forced them to retreat. Several Boats over&s;et, &s;everal were &s;hattered to Pieces, and all the Men jumped into the Water, to follow their intrepid Leader.</P>
<P>MANY were the Services whereby he afterwards &s;ignali&s;ed him&s;elf during this Siege; and particu|larly, when, on Intelligence received that the Ene|my had de&s;troyed the grand Battery, and called in their Out-po&s;ts, he was detached with 1200 Men, four Companies of Grenadiers, three Companies of Rangers, and &s;ome light Infantry, round the north-ea&s;t Harbour to the Light-Hou&s;e Point, to &s;ilence the I&s;land Battery, and at the &s;ame Time to attempt to de&s;troy the Ships in the Harbour. He took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Light-Hou&s;e Point, with all the Po&s;ts on that Side the Harbour, which the Enemy had abandoned, with &s;everal Cannon; and, when a large Party of them had crept out one Morning, to get &s;ome old Pali&s;ades and Wood, he pu&s;hed them in with a bri&s;k Fire; and, taking Po&s;ts on the Hills, from whence it was intended to try to demoli&s;h the Shipping, he marched forward on the Right, and forced the Enemy back to <HI>Cape Noire,</HI> with a &s;mart Fire. After this, a great Cannonading continuing from the Town and Shipping on our Batteries, he was making an ad|vanced Work on the Right, thrown up at 650
<PB N="19" REF="008702_0018_102FBA579F57F8B8">Yards from the Covered-Way, with an Intention of erecting a Battery to de&s;troy the Defences of the Place. The next Thing he did, was to pu&s;h on a Corps, and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Hills in the Front of the Bara&s;oy, where he made a Lodg|ment: And, la&s;tly, a few Days before the Town capitulated, his Batteries contributed greatly to burn three of the Enemy's Ships. In &s;hort, it is incredible what extraordinary Feats he performed in this Siege; and all of them the genuine Effects of his di&s;tingui&s;hed Abilities, his Conduct and In|trepidity; which rendered him a Terror to the E|nemy, and not without ju&s;t Rea&s;on the Safeguard and Ornament of his Country.</P>
<P>ON his Return home, what Encomiums were pa&s;&s;ed upon him by all Degrees of Men! But he, mode&s;t and di&s;creet, a&s;cribed all the Glory to the prudent Management of him under whom he fought. It was a &s;ufficient Satisfaction to him&s;elf that his Country had been faithfully &s;erved, and that he had done what he thought only his Duty. Unparalleled Moderation in the Manner of accepting the Tribute of Prai&s;e! Yet it is by the&s;e and the like humble Sentiments that exalted Merit appears in the Bloom of never-fading Beauty. Pride, and Arrogance, and Self-conceit will make but a Con|temptible Figure; and, notwith&s;tanding all En|deavours to impo&s;e by a glaring Out&s;ide, cannot help &s;hewing the ridiculous Deformity.</P>
<P>WOLFE then de&s;erved, as the Re&s;torer of the Reputation of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Arms; as the Conquer|or of <HI>Cape Breton</HI> with the noble <HI>Amher&s;t;</HI> to ride with him in the triumphal Car of Fame.
<PB N="20" REF="008702_0019_102FBA592363EBD8"><HI>Amher&s;t</HI> does not refu&s;e to acknowledge him the Partner of his Glory: Even without Jealou&s;y he felicitates him that others think as well of him as of him&s;elf; and, to declare how eminently he &s;tands in his E&s;teem, he generou&s;ly recommends him to his Country, as worthy of the highe&s;t military Command. This Recommendation, tho' powerful, and highly valued by the grateful WOLFE, did not however carry that Force and Energy with it as his own Actions. They &s;poke aloud what he was and what he would be; and, though &s;ilent him&s;elf, uninfluenced by Ambition, which he was never known to court through the Mediation of the Great; intirely pa&s;&s;ive in the Di&s;po&s;al that might be made of his Abilities, he was called upon, as the u&s;eful Man in the Exi|gencies of the State, to command the important Expedition again&s;t <HI>Quebec.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is &s;omething &s;ecret in Nature, not to be defined or expre&s;&s;ed by Words, which, on con&s;i|dering certain Objects, rou&s;es the Pa&s;&s;ions from the Indolency of Indifference, to make them im|bibe the Delicacies of Refinement, and elates the Soul with a full Pro&s;pect of Grandeur, Magnifi|cence, Excellence, and Delight. Such is the Co&s;ideration of WOLFE's Spirit in the conducting of this Enterpri&s;e; it is an Object that quickens the dull Lethargy of the Pa&s;&s;ions into the livelie&s;t Tran&s;ports; we cannot withold our Admiration of it; the Soul &s;ometimes quietly and joyfully re&s;ts in its Contemplation; &s;ometimes &s;he is winged into Exta&s;ies; for &s;he finds in it both Grandeur and Delight: Not Grandeur and Delight contracted within a narrow Compa&s;s, as in a
<PB N="21" REF="008702_0020_102FBA5F9540CFA8">Meadow variegated with Flowers, and receiving an additional Beauty from a purling Brook, taught to water the tender Gra&s;s; but Grandeur and Delight, va&s;t and exten&s;ive, as in the unbounded Pro&s;pect of Hills and Vales, inumbrated with tall Cedars, and watered by an expanded River.</P>
<P>FEW or none ever before ro&s;e to WOLFE's great Reputation in War, till they had fir&s;t obtained and firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed it by repeated Victories and Commands. He, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, as an unpre|cedented Example, building upon the Foundation of &s;carce any other Advantages than the Expectati|on he had rai&s;ed of him&s;elf, at once gained &s;uch an A&s;cendant in the Love of his Fellow-&s;ubjects, the Confidence of the Soldiery, the E&s;teem of the Officers, the Re&s;pect of the Government, the Fa|vour of the Court, that all, with undi&s;gui&s;ed u|nanimous Suffrages, placed him in the Summit of this Command. We &s;hall now &s;ee how he behav|ed him&s;elf in it, how he proved him&s;elf worthy of it; as otherwi&s;e a General mu&s;t have little Rea&s;on to value him&s;elf upon the mo&s;t &s;hining Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Gazette of <HI>October</HI> 16, 1759.</NOTE> General WOLFE appeared before <HI>Que|bec,</HI> in the River of <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> with his Troops, he found the Ob&s;tacles to his intended Operations much greater than he had Rea&s;on to expect, or could fore&s;ee, and chiefly from the na|tural Strength of the Country, which the Enemy &s;eemed wi&s;ely to depend upon. To complete their Security, Succours of all Kinds had been thrown into <HI>Quebec,</HI> and a numerous Body of re|gular
<PB N="22" REF="008702_0021_102FBA62B31CE660">Troops, joined to the Troops of the Colony, filled up with every <HI>Canadian</HI> that was able to bear Arms, be&s;ides &s;everal Nations of Savages, had taken the Field in a very advantageous Situ|ation.</P>
<P>WHAT was the Pro&s;pect of reducing a Place which was every Way &s;o well prepared for a vi|gorous Defence? General WOLFE could not flat|ter him&s;elf that he was able to effect it; yet, with his little Army, who&s;e Courage and Re&s;olution he could depend upon, he hoped, if an Opportunity offered of attacking that of the Enemy, however &s;uperior and formidable, he &s;hould di&s;concert their Mea&s;ures by di&s;per&s;ing them, and &s;o as to facilitate with Succe&s;s an Attack upon the Town.</P>
<P>THE Enemy were encamped along the Shore, and intrenched in every acce&s;&s;ible Part. On his Landing upon the I&s;le of <HI>Orleans,</HI> he found it ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary both to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of, and to fortify, the Point of <HI>Levi,</HI> and the We&s;termo&s;t Point of the I&s;le; becau&s;e, from either the one or the other, the Enemy might make it impo&s;&s;ible for any Ship to lie in the Ba&s;on of <HI>Quebec,</HI> or even within two Miles of it. This Service being per|formed with little Lo&s;s, he ordered Batteries of Cannon and Mortars to be erected with great Di&s;patch on the Point of <HI>Levi,</HI> to bombard the Town and Magazines, and to injure the Works and Batteries. The Enemy, perceiving the&s;e Works in great Forwardne&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed the River to attack and de&s;troy them; but, falling into Confu&s;ion, they fired upon one another, and went back; and the Effect of this Artillery was &s;o great though a|cro&s;s
<PB N="23" REF="008702_0022_102FBA6631134738">the River, that the Upper Town was con&s;i|derably damaged, and the Lower intirely de&s;troy|ed.</P>
<P>THE Variety of his other Di&s;po&s;itions, Strata|gems, and ma&s;terly Strokes of General&s;hip, are &s;till &s;o recent in every one's Memory, that a Detail of them is unnece&s;&s;ary; and it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that, to draw the Enemy from their Situation, and bring them to an Action, he at la&s;t formed and ex|ecuted that great Plan of conveying his Troops a|bove the Town, after leaving the Points of <HI>Levi</HI> and <HI>Orleans</HI> in a proper State of Defence. He was but ju&s;t then recovered from a dangerous Fit of Illne&s;s, yet his bodily Strength, as if not in the lea&s;t impaired, was &s;o refre&s;hed by the Vigour of his Mind, that he was pre&s;ent in Per&s;on, active, dili|gent, and indefatigable, wherever any Thing was to be done or ordered for taking an Advantage of the Enemy. Thus fulfilling, in his whole Man|ner, the Character of <HI>Cae&s;ar;</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nil actum reputans &s;i quid &s;upre&s;&s;et agendum.</HI></P>
<P>AND now the Enemy being obliged to quit their Po&s;t, collected the whole of their Forces, and ad|vanced to give Battle, which they could not avoid. General WOLFE, in the mean Time, put his little Army in extreme good Order, and di&s;played his Ranks &s;o as to &s;trike a Terror into the Enemy by the Appearance of a far greater Number than he really had. Cool, provident, and prepared in this Manner for all Events, his Troops &s;hewing, at the &s;ame Time, a Countenance mixed with Alacrity and Steadine&s;s, he received the Enemy's fir&s;t Shcok,
<PB N="24" REF="008702_0023_102FBA6C8242ACA0">which, as it is cu&s;tomary with them, was very bri&s;k and animated. But this their Vivacity, from a little Check, is &s;oon relaxed into the Debility of unre&s;i&s;ting Languor; the Man degenerates into Woman, and can only exert a like impotent Strug|gle. WOLFE prudently re&s;erved his Fire till he was within forty Yards, and then it was &s;o well continued, and with &s;o good Effect, that the Ene|my every where gave Way. In this On&s;et, a Mu&s;quet-Ball pierced through, and &s;hattered the Bone of his Wri&s;t; but, regardle&s;s of &s;uch a pain|ful and de&s;perate Wound, he immediately wrapped it up, and, quite unconcerned, followed the impe|tuous Blow he had ju&s;t &s;truck, giving the Enemy no Time to recover from the Con&s;ternation and Confu&s;ion he had thrown them into. Then it was, in the Mid&s;t of the Havock he was making, thin|ning and mowing down their Ranks, that, a &s;e|cond Ball pa&s;&s;ing through his Body, he fell at the Head of his brave Grenadiers, as they were darting, like Lightning, to a&s;&s;ail with their Bayonets.</P>
<P>OH! WOLFE; what a melancholly Fall was this for thy Country, yet, glorious and honoura|ble to thee, and &s;till more glorious and honourable by the Circum&s;tances that attended it! When faint and breathle&s;s, through the Effu&s;ion of thy Blood, thou wa&s;t, by the Mournful Mini&s;try of a few Soldiers, carried off from that Scene of Victory, ready to proclaim thee the Conqueror of <HI>Canada,</HI> thou did&s;t, &s;till intent upon the Event, rai&s;e thy drooping Head, and check the mighty Conflicts of thy Soul, ha&s;tening to &s;ever her&s;elf from thy Body: This thou did&s;t with new Life and Mo|tion, when the Shout of, <HI>They run,</HI> &s;ounded in
<PB N="25" REF="008702_0024_102FBA6ED545D4D0">thy Ears. Thou did&s;t a&s;k, with all the Eagerne&s;s of &s;trong Perturbation, <HI>Who run?</HI> and receiving the joyous An&s;wer, that the Enemy were routed, with a complete and deci&s;ive Overthrow, thou did&s;t reply, in tender Emotions for thy Country's Succe&s;s, <HI>Then, I thank God, I die contented.</HI> Peace and Compo&s;ure, with the&s;e Words, &s;ealed thy Eye|lids, and thy Head gently reclining, willingly re|&s;igned thy mortal Life.</P>
<P>IF we &s;earch the Records of Hi&s;tory for a Death like that of WOLFE, &s;hall we find one, in all Re|&s;pects, &s;o Noble? Many have fought for their Coun|try, and died in its Defence, perhaps with Sentiments of Magnanimity equal to his, and with as undaunt|ed a Re&s;olution to &s;ubmit to the Laws of Fatality; but how few, under his Circum&s;tances, have gra|ced Death with &s;uch attractive Charms, that what commonly is abhorred as an Evil, &s;eems plea&s;ing, welcome, and de&s;irable? We prai&s;e then, we mag|nify &s;uch a Death; we exult within our&s;elves, that we can produce &s;uch an Example to awake Imita|tion upon a like Occa&s;ion; and we even &s;ay, that &s;o to die, is not to die in Effect, is not to be ex|tinct and forgotten, but to live in the Memory of future Ages, till that Duration comes when Time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>WOLFE has acquired that Life of la&s;ting Me|mory; none envy it him; <HI>He flouri&s;hes like the Balm-tree, and &s;hall be exalted as the Cedar of Le|banon;</HI> every grateful <HI>Briton</HI> has already rai&s;ed a Monument to him in his Brea&s;t; and Marble &s;hall be taught, under the Hands of the Arti&s;t, to pay him its Homage, by all the emblematical Il|lu&s;trations of Heroi&s;m it is capable of expre&s;&s;ing:
<PB N="26" REF="008702_0025_102FBA705A2CCA58">But what &s;hall we further &s;ay, and what &s;hall we feel, whil&s;t, with admiring Eyes, we &s;urvey the Apparatus of this condign Pomp, whil&s;t the magnificent Objects convey to us an Idea of the Excellence they repre&s;ent? We &s;hall &s;ay, <HI>It is</HI> WOLFE <HI>that has de&s;erved all this:</HI> We can &s;ay no more; we feel the re&s;t; we feel the bright Effigies of his Glory making our Bo&s;oms to pant, but its Beauties are not to be told; neither can we de&s;cribe its Height and Depth; the Imagination wanders in a Maze, and cannot figure out the exact Mea|&s;urement.</P>
<P>IF we place this Death of WOLFE in another Point of View, looking back to the Cau&s;e for which he died, a Cau&s;e no other than the Love of &s;erving his Country; we &s;hall have Rea&s;on to lament that Ardour which expo&s;ed him &s;o much to the Perils of War, and &s;et open again&s;t him the greedy Jaws of Mortality before his Time; we &s;hall imbibe a little Tincture of Jealou&s;y again&s;t the Monuments and Trophies, de&s;tined as if too &s;oon to perpetuate his Memory; we &s;hall accu&s;e as a little too ha&s;ty the putting him in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch an Accumu|lation of Glory. Ju&s;t Regret! ju&s;t Jealou&s;y; ju&s;t Complaint! His Country has &s;uffered by his Lo&s;s; &s;he now is thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of it; &s;he wi&s;hes his Life had been protracted into a full Length of Days; and &s;he &s;ighs, apprehen&s;ive of not finding a Man like him to fight her Battles.</P>
<P>HENCE is the Source of Tears for WOLFE's Death, which refu&s;es to be intirely dried up; and hence the plaintive Voice of Grief, which has been beard from all Parts of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Realms. It
<PB N="27" REF="008702_0026_102FBA760A843708">will &s;till be renewed with the deepe&s;t Concern, whenever we approach that hallowed Ground where his precious Remains are depo&s;ited, or vi&s;it the Monuments con&s;ecrated to his Memory. Thither we &s;hall come in&s;pired with a reverential Awe for the Place! for the Virtues that guard its Precincts, with Frowns and &s;tern Looks, bid the Prophane &s;tand aloof. The pure in Heart and Well-wi&s;hers to their Country will come, and mourning in the Silence of their Hearts, will &s;ometimes &s;tart with Surpri&s;e, and &s;peak within them&s;elves; "Then WOLFE is dead?&mdash;Surely he is gone too &s;oon!&mdash; Propitious Heaven lent him only for a Day!&mdash; Death found him too fine a Victim!&mdash;And is he then dead? He who was the Author of &s;o much Happine&s;s to us! He who was the Son of Honour, truly brave, truly noble, friendly and candid, gentle and beneficent, great and glorious!"</P>
<P>BEHOLD, the Soldier comes! He who&s;e Hands WOLFE had taught and fitted to battle, and who&s;e Soul he had filled with Courage and Per&s;everance: He mourns his Lo&s;s in him, the be&s;t of Officers, becau&s;e with him his chief Happine&s;s is vani&s;hed. WOLFE had always a Fellow-feeling for him; his Treatment of him was always humane; and he never let his Services pa&s;s unrewarded. What Af|fection, what Gratitude, what Willingne&s;s, what Confidence, what Ardour, mu&s;t not Manners &s;o conciliating in the General, excite and cheri&s;h in the Soldier!</P>

The Decorum of Life and Virgin-Mode&s;ty po&s;t|pone the happy Day. In the mean Time, his Country's Cau&s;e calls WOLFE away. Love may bid him decline its Support; may paint with Hor|rors to him the A&s;pect of War; but he, mindful of the Dictates of Honour, and, above all, of the Duty he owes to his Country, removes, without Reluctance, from his Sight the Blandi&s;hments of Love, and all the alluring Sweets of dome&s;tic Ea&s;e and Felicity; and, though he fondly may de&s;ire to embrace and enjoy them, for the Sake of her, and with her, who generou&s;ly makes a Tender of them; yet they ought not, in his Opinion, to take Place of the Plea&s;ure that will ari&s;e from the Con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done well in the Service and for the Love of our Country. The Way to the&s;e Plea&s;ures is be&s;et with Hard&s;hips, Difficulties, and Dangers; to the other &s;mooth, ea&s;y, and &s;ecure: Yet it &s;eemed not &s;o eligible to WOLFE, who knew the ine&s;timable Value of the pure Satisfaction of the Mind, and, at the &s;ame Time, did not &s;light the Gratification of Sen&s;e, if it was in his Circum&s;tan|ces immediately con&s;i&s;tent with his Honour. Thou al&s;o, illu&s;trious Maid, Mirrour of thy Sex! thou coulde&s;t not delight in the Man in who&s;e Honour thy di&s;cerning Eye did perceive the lea&s;t Stain.

<P>EPAMINONDAS, the great <HI>Theban</HI> Captain, (whom WOLFE al&s;o re&s;embles, as dying, like him, victorious over his Enemy) being a&s;ked, which of his Friends he loved be&s;t; an&s;wered, that they
<PB N="30" REF="008702_0029_102FBA7F6A4482C8">mu&s;t all die before he could be po&s;itive in deciding the Degree they held in his E&s;teem. The &s;ame Thought has been adopted and improved by o|thers, but by all with the Intention of inculcating, that none can be deemed truly good and happy before they die, Death alone being the Te&s;t of their Actions, &s;o far as it points out, by a ju&s;t Mea&s;ure, the Depravity and Rectitude di&s;coverable in them. If <HI>Britons</HI> were now a&s;ked the Que&s;tion, which of their Generals they love be&s;t; they would an&s;wer, without He&s;itation, WOLFE; becau&s;e the Conduct of his whole Life was invariably the &s;ame, great and good, and Death authenticated and ratified this Greatne&s;s and Goodne&s;s, by affixing her Seal to it with an indelible Impre&s;&s;ion. Other Generals, re|nowned in Hi&s;tory for being great Ma&s;ters in the Art of War, appear in a very contemptible Light, when dive&s;ted of the external Pageantry that ob&s;cures the Deformity of their Actions in private Life: They are then the mere Man, and not the Hero. The Succe&s;s of their Enter|prizes, however obtru&s;ive of the Ideas of Pomp and Grandeur on weak Minds, cannot ex|tenuate the pernicious Effects of their Ambition, or Avarice, or Lu&s;t, or Cruelties, or Oppre&s;&s;ion. To gratify the&s;e inordinate Pa&s;&s;ions, they waded through a Sea of Blood; they led Armies in|to a Field of Slaughter; they taught them the Way and Manner of butchering one another; and, in the End, in&s;tead of fighting the Bat|tles of their Country in Support of its own Inde|pendency, or the Rights and Liberties of Mankind, they proved the mercile&s;s De&s;troyers of God's Creatures, and the Violaters of the mo&s;t &s;acred Laws of human Society. Death often &s;eized upon them
<PB N="31" REF="008702_0030_102FBA820B7BE548">in the Mid&s;t of their Havock and Outrages, and tran&s;mitted them, as they de&s;erved, deeply branded with the Ignominy of their enormous Guilt, to the Horror and Dete&s;tation of Po&s;terity. Not &s;o with WOLFE: Without Ambition, Avarice, or any other Vice, his Talents were employed in Defence of the Independence of his Country, with which the Rights and Liberties of <HI>Europe</HI> are intimately con|nected: As another <HI>Judas Maccabeus, be fought with Chearfulne&s;s its Battle; his People by it got great Honour; be burnt up tho&s;e that vexed his Peo|ple; Salvation pro&s;pered in his Hand, and his Me|morial is ble&s;&s;ed for ever.</HI></P>
<P>GREAT GOD! ju&s;t and terrible in thy Judg|ments, with what an humbling Blow to Humanity ha&s;t thou &s;truck us, by the Death of our beloved General JAMES WOLFE! But, Lord, if thou do&s;t un&s;heath thy Sword, it is not to de&s;troy, but to mend; it is not to bla&s;t our Hopes, but to make them &s;pring with a fuller Bloom; it is not to cru&s;h us under the Weight of thy Vengeance, but to teach us to ri&s;e &s;uperior to all Di&s;a&s;ters. Thou ha&s;t in JAMES WOLFE &s;et an Example to our Generals and Officers, that, by faithfully copying after it, they may learn to relinqui&s;h voluptuous Ea&s;e, de&s;|pi&s;e Dangers and Difficulties, and, when nece&s;&s;ary, fall gloriou&s;ly, like him, for their Country. Stung and quickened by noble Emulation, behold they make ready to run for the Prize in the &s;ame Cour&s;e of Glory. It is PITT, who, with thy divine Provi|dence, was appointed the tutely Genius of this Nation, that leads the Way with Precept. Thy Wi&s;dom has repleni&s;hed him with the good Gifts of deliberating maturely, judging &s;oundly, coun&s;elling &s;ecurely,
<PB N="32" REF="008702_0031_102FBA850B3EF3B8">ordaining exactly, and executing effectually. He has introduced the Ble&s;&s;ings of Harmony and good Under&s;tanding between our Commanders both by Sea and Land; they now no longer ob&s;truct the Nation's Welfare by Contradictions, Di&s;&s;en&s;ions, and Di&s;obedience. Oh! may the Ble&s;&s;ing conti|nue! And may we never want a PITT, under the au&s;picious Influence of his Maje&s;ty, to find for us another WOLFE; who&s;e Lo&s;s, though we are &s;incerely afflicted for it, thy all-gracious Care, O God, has abundantly compen&s;ated, by pre&s;erving to us his Like in <HI>Amher&s;t, Monckton, Town&s;hend, Hawke,</HI> and <HI>Saunders!</HI></P>

<P>Stop, Pa&s;&s;enger! And here view whatever is Grand and Noble, Summed up in the Character of JAMES WOLFE.</P>
<LG>
<L>His Mind being adorned with all heroic Virtues,</L>
<L>Both by the Precept and Example of his illu&s;trious Father,</L>
<L>Colonel EDWARD WOLFE;</L>
<L>He, early in Life, as the Choice of his natural Di&s;po&s;ition,</L>
<L>Embraced the Pro&s;e&s;&s;ion of Arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With indefatigable Indu&s;try forming the Military Man,</L>
<L>He &s;hewed him&s;elf</L>
<L>Gallant in Action, intrepid in Danger, circum&s;pect in Difficulties;</L>
<L>And being &s;oon &s;ingled out as a true Genius for the Art of War,</L>
<L>With the Approbation and Applau&s;e</L>
<L>Of the great Officers he &s;erved under,</L>
<L>Was honoured, in a con&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>With the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Po&s;ts in the Army.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His innate Courage, his Regularity and Exactne&s;s of Di&s;cipline,</L>
<L>Shone con&s;picuous in the Corps he had him&s;elf trained up,</L>
<L>When animating five others by its Example in the Plains of <HI>Minden,</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>French</HI> Cavalry, by the Impetuo&s;ity of their Efforts,</L>
<L>Were broken, routed, and di&s;comfited.</L>
<L>Po&s;terity! believe it:</L>
<L>the Annals of all <HI>Europe</HI> atte&s;t the Fact.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His martial Ardour and Capacity,</L>
<L>Re&s;trained by &s;uperiour Command at <HI>Rochfort,</HI></L>
<L>Were &s;ignal in the Overthrow of <HI>Loui&s;bourg.</HI></L>
<L>You may &s;tile him, with <HI>Amher&s;t,</HI> the CONQUEROR of <HI>Cape-Breton</HI></L>
<L>The Brave do not envy the Brave;</L>
<L>He let him act according to the generous Purpo&s;e of his Soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now thought worthy of a Command in Chief;</L>
<L>QUEBEC,</L>
<L>The Capital of the <HI>French</HI> Empire in <HI>North-Amercia,</HI></L>
<L>Is made the Object of the important Conque&s;t,</L>
<L>Expected from his great Abilities.</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="008702_0035_102FBA902FDF62E8">
Art had con&s;pired with Nature</L>
<L>To render the Place impregnable:</L>
<L>But he, undaunted amid&s;t &s;uch a Scene of Difficulties,</L>
<L>Climbs over Rocks and Precipices,</L>
<L>Lays the Lower Town in A&s;hes,</L>
<L>Draws out the numerous Force of CANADA again&s;t him,</L>
<L>And with le&s;s than five thou&s;and Men</L>
<L>But &s;tout, vigorous, and ardent for Battle,</L>
<L>Routs and defeats them with great Slaughter.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>VICTORY, alas!</L>
<L>Had &s;carce dawned upon him with triumphant Rays of Light,</L>
<L>Ready to &s;alute him,</L>
<L>The CONQUEROR of <HI>Canada,</HI></L>
<L>When he fell gloriou&s;ly,</L>

<L><HI>Britons!</HI> rejoice and mourn:</L>
<L>Rejoice that your Arms have pro&s;pered</L>
<L>Under the Conduct of &s;o great a General;</L>

<L>Who&s;e Morals, a Copy of Go&s;pel-Purity,</L>
<L>Taught him to die contented for his Country.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To perpetuate his Memory,</L>
<L>This Monument was erected by the &s;pecial Command</L>
