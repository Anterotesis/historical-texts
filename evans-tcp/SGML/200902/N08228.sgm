<P>THE en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e makes its Appearance in Compliance with your repeated Solicitations; and not from any Fondne&s;s in me to commence Author. Neither had I the mo&s;t di&s;tant Expectation when preparing for the Pulpit, that it would ever be called for after You had heard it. I therefore thought it nece&s;&s;ary, in tran&s;cribing for the Pre&s;s, to make con|&s;iderable Enlargements; for which I per&s;uade my&s;elf I need make no Apology.</P>
<P>The Exta&s;y which this good News occa&s;ioned, a|mong all Ranks of People, as &s;oon as certainly known; compared with that awful Indifference, with which the glad Tidings of Salvation are heard by our Inha|bitants in general; at once &s;ugge&s;ted to me the Expe|diency of attempting to improve it in this &s;piritual Manner.</P>
<P>I would therefore with all Humility, lay this &s;mall Performance at the Feet of Je&s;us, who is exalted as Head over all Things to the Church; and who can, out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings perfect Prai&s;e. And remain,</P>

<P>_SHOULD I &s;erve you a century in the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, I might never again have &s;o favourable an op|portunity to con&s;ider this pa&s;&s;age. It is a proverb, the truth of which you are now feeling: Hence great is the propriety of improving its &s;piritual mean|ing. And the preacher will have the advantage, while he attempts to illu&s;trate the glories of the go&s;pel, by what the people feel. Has not a ge|neral joy diffu&s;ed it&s;elf among&s;t us? Does not Bo&s;ton and the country wear a face of plea&s;ant|ne&s;s?

You may read good news in every counte|nance. How great the alteration, that has taken place among&s;t us, in con&s;equence of a late mo&s;t intere&s;ting deci&s;ion in our favour! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the Repeal of the Stamp-Act.</NOTE> When the news arrived, &s;o as to be confidently believed, there was a univer&s;al &s;hout.&mdash;It now became im|po&s;&s;ible for every lover of liberty and his country, to conceal the gladne&s;s of his heart: Public and private were the expre&s;&s;ions of joy on this im|portant occa&s;ion! Yea your children, yet igno|rant of the importance of this event to the&s;e colonies, bear a part in the triumphs of the day; in imitation, no doubt, of their parents and o|thers, whom they ob&s;erve plea&s;ed on this happy occurrence. Well thought I, will good news from an earthly Prince, that brings deliverance, and gives us the pro&s;pect of the continuance of our mo&s;t dear and invaluable rights and privi|leges, which we apprehended on the brink of departing from us; fill us with &s;uch a general gladne&s;s, that &s;carce a tongue will be &s;ilent?&mdash; Oh how much more might we expect that the glad tidings of &s;alvation; &s;alvation from ever|la&s;ting mi&s;ery, to the fruition of endle&s;s happine&s;s, would diffu&s;e a univer&s;al joy!&mdash;How ju&s;tly might we look for the tongue of the dumb to &s;ing &mdash; for the &s;tammerer to &s;peak plainly; and for the mouths of babes and &s;ucklings, to help on the exalted tribute of prai&s;e to Him, who hath com|mitted to men the mini&s;try of reconciliation; de|claring <HI>peace on earth, good will towards men?</HI> But alas, &s;uch is the carnality of the heart of man, that though &s;oon elated with temporal deliver|ance;

he is blind to, and too little affected with the <HI>great &s;alvation!</HI> What means this &s;trange conduct? The one is believed with a warm heart; the other &s;eems to the poor &s;inner as an idle tale, and he believes it not! Surely "the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that be|lieve not, le&s;t the light of the glorious go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, who is the image of God, &s;hould &s;hine unto them." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 4.4.</NOTE></P>
<P>AGAIN. Do I ob&s;erve both the righteous, and the wicked rejoicing on this occa&s;ion? Yes: And let me add, good rea&s;on they have to do &s;o. But on the other, though infinitely more important, even the righteous them&s;elves are &s;hamefully neg|ligent, and lukewarm.&mdash;Do I &s;ee the children in the &s;treets exulting in this good news from a far country? Oh thought I that this news of re|demption thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, might be &s;o gladly, and generally received; and become &s;o powerful in its influence on parents and heads of families, that their lives and conver&s;ations, might &s;weetly con&s;train their little ones to join that triumphant <HI>"Ho&s;anna to the Son of David,"</HI> Mat. 21.15.&mdash;But why &s;hould we wonder if the children withhold the tribute of prai&s;e, when the parents them&s;elves are &s;infully &s;ilent?</P>
<P>ARE we tenacious of our rights and liberties? And do we fear every thing that looks like an infringment? What think we then of our con|duct towards Him, who is the only Potentate? How often have we been for wre&s;ting the go|vernment

He may &s;ay to us, "Ye have robbed me." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. 3.8.</NOTE> Numerous have been our provocations again&s;t Him; and if he had entred into judgment with us, we &s;hould have been cut off in our iniquity, and forever confined with the &s;pirits in pri&s;on. But lo, here is good news from a far country, a "God in Chri&s;t re|conciling the world to him&s;elf!"&mdash;A method of &s;alvation, exhibited in the go&s;pel, that effectually &s;ecures the honours of the divine government, and the harmony of Jehovah's attributes; while the chief of &s;inners are made heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Je&s;us Chri&s;t! "As cold waters to a thir&s;ty &s;oul: &s;o is this good news from a far country." <Q>The proverbial &s;en&s;e (&s;ays Dr. Jermin) is, That what is gotten by hard la|bour, and after much time &s;pent upon it, being as it were fetched from a far country, is mo&s;t delightful being obtained. But to make u&s;e of the ver&s;e in a more &s;piritual application: The farthe&s;t country that lies any where is heaven: And the good news are the tidings of the go&s;|pel.</Q> In this &s;piritual manner, I &s;hall, thro' di|vine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, improve the text.

<ITEM>I. OBSERVE, That we have news from hea|ven; a far country.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. CONSIDER by what means this news has been conveyed to us.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="9" REF="010503_0008_0F80185A935BA870">III. THAT it is "news" indeed; and empha|tically "good news."</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. THAT this good news from heaven, is more welcome to a heavy laden &s;inner, and a true believer thir&s;ting after God, than cold waters are to any one athir&s;t.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>FIRST, We have news from heaven, a far coun|try. It is not uncommon in the &s;acred writings, to &s;peak of heaven as a country: "But now they de&s;ire a better country, that is, an heavenly." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 11.16.</NOTE> In which chapter, the &s;ame word is repeated, to &s;ignify, that the believing Hebrews were in the pur&s;uit of the kingdom of heaven.</P>
<P>NOW the news we have from thence, the apo&s;tle Paul epitomizes, in writing to his Son Timothy, of the exceeding riches of the grace of God in his conver&s;ion, and call to the apo&s;tle&s;hip: "This is a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners; of whom I am chief." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 1.15.</NOTE> I a&s;k you, as Chri&s;t did the Jews of John's bapti&s;m, Is this news from heaven, or of men?&mdash;You will readily an&s;wer, methinks, from heaven. From heaven it is, my Brethren.</P>
<P N="1">I. AS it was there this glorious &s;cheme of re|demption was concluded on, the &s;ubjects of it cho|&s;en, and all the certain means of its execution deter|mined. There it originated, and from thence it came. The covenant of grace bears an antient
<PB N="10" REF="010503_0009_0F80185B9454D580">
date, even from eternity: Tho' the di&s;pen&s;ation of it is late, &s;ince man's apo&s;tacy. Hence when Paul preached to the Ephe&s;ians, the un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t, he lets them know, that his call to the mini&s;try, and the go&s;pel he delivered, were "according to God's eternal purpo&s;e, which he purpo&s;ed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;. 3.11.</NOTE> And in this &s;ame epi&s;tle, he &s;peaks of our having been "cho&s;en in Chri&s;t, before the foundation of the world." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;. 1.4.</NOTE> Various are the pa&s;&s;ages of holy &s;cripture, that lead us to contemplate this <HI>coun&s;el of peace,</HI> in eter|nity; before the world began. Then this ever|la&s;ting covenant, was well ordered in all things and &s;ure. Je&s;us Chri&s;t was cho&s;en by the Father, as the head of it; the heirs of promi&s;e were cho&s;en in Him, and given to him as members of it; the means of their pre&s;ervation, effectual calling, and perfect &s;anctification, were appointed. In &s;hort, no part of it was left precarious; it being an ab|&s;olute covenant. <Q>If the covenant of grace (&s;ays one) were not ab&s;olute, &s;alvation would be as difficult by it, as by the covenant of works; be|cau&s;e it is as hard for a natural man to believe and live, as it is for him to do and live.</Q> This great truth, which appears to me to &s;hine with di&s;|tingui&s;hed brightne&s;s, in the holy Bible, is full of &s;olid comfort to the pious &s;oul; an article of high importance in the church of Chri&s;t; and when rightly under&s;tood, has a mo&s;t powerful influence on the believer's practice. So far as I have had time, and opportunity to ob&s;erve, I am led to con|clude, That a deviation from this and the other glorious doctrines, that are connected with it, has
<PB N="11" REF="010503_0010_0F80185BB3510DF0">
generally been attended with a decay of vital religion. Its having been oppo&s;ed is not &s;trange: For you may be confident, that nothing &s;hort of divine influence, can bring a &s;inner to fall in with, and really to &s;ubmit to the &s;overeignty of God. A maxim that men have adopted, and which they warmly plead for with regard to them|&s;elves; they will not acknowledge when applied to the God of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h, viz. "That every one may do what he will with his own." But notwith&s;tanding the different &s;entiments of man|kind as to this point; you will bear with me, while I &s;ay, That I believe it to be a doctrine from heaven.</P>
<P N="2">II. IT is from heaven, as the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is the author of this &s;alvation, is from thence. "I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. 16.28.</NOTE> Which I &s;uppo&s;e is to be un|der&s;tood of Chri&s;t, his a&s;&s;uming human nature: Or his appearing in that body, that had been prepared for him. "A body ha&s;t thou pre|pared me" <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 10.5.</NOTE> And this a&s;&s;umption of our na|ture was in the fulne&s;s of time. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. 4.4.</NOTE> i. e. the time appointed in eternity. This coming forth from the Father, can only hold true of Chri&s;t as medi|ator; as al&s;o where it is &s;aid, "That God &s;ent him." As God, he fills all places at the &s;ame time; and therefore can neither be &s;aid to go nor come. Neither as God can he be &s;ent; for then God mu&s;t &s;end God. i. e. He mu&s;t &s;end him&s;elf. This is unintelligible. But as mediator, he is &s;ent: In this character he came forth from the Father,
<PB N="12" REF="010503_0011_0F80185C76312B40">
and came into the world, when he became openly incarnate.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps an objection will be &s;tarted&mdash;"If the Son of God can only be &s;aid to be &s;ent, as con|&s;idered in human nature; how is it that the &s;ame phra&s;e is u&s;ed of the Holy Gho&s;t; who, as you &s;ay, is God equal with the Father and the Son; and never appeared in an a&s;&s;umed nature, but re|mains a pure, infinite &s;pirit?" For an an&s;wer to this objection, I freely give credit to the learned and pious Mr. Hu&s;&s;ey. <Q>The Spirit's mi&s;&s;ion (&s;ays he) is not as the &s;pirit is God, it is not ab&s;tract|edly God the &s;pirit; for the Holy Gho&s;t could not be &s;ent or come from the Father thus, becau&s;e as an infinite per&s;on, he doth together with the Father and the Son, fill all places at once, and &s;o as the Spirit is God, mu&s;t not be &s;aid to go from one place to another, but it is as Comforter that he doth &s;o. He doth not fill all the world as Comforter, but it is as God the Spirit that he fills all the world.</Q> I ob&s;erve, my hearers, when Chri&s;t promi&s;ed the Spirit, and &s;aid he would &s;end him, it was under the character of Comforter. "I will &s;end you another Comforter."&mdash;"If I go not away, the Comforter will not come." Thus mak|ing a di&s;tinction between his office, and his e&s;&s;ence. As the &s;ame author &s;ays, <Q>He is not given in his e&s;&s;ence, but in his office, as the immediate cau&s;e of our obtaining the graces of the &s;pirit.</Q> Here|by we know that <Q>he abideth in us, by the &s;pirit which he hath given us, 1 John 3.24. Here is his per&s;on in the office of a Comforter.</Q> Again. <Q>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he
<PB N="13" REF="010503_0012_0F80185D47809BC8">
in us, becau&s;e he hath given us of his Spirit, 1 John 14.3. There are the graces of the &s;pirit, and both put together do make up the full di&s;tinction in the two branches of it as laid down above.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hu&s;&s;ey's Glory of Chri&s;t unveil'd.</NOTE></P>
<P>THUS the objection is an&s;wered, while we di&s;tin|gui&s;h the office of the Holy Gho&s;t, from his e&s;&s;ence as God. He was &s;ent as a Paraclete or Comforter, but not as God the Spirit.</P>
<P>I MIGHT go on to ob&s;erve, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t made it evident, that he was from heaven, by the kingdom he &s;et up in the world. His appearance among men; making him&s;elf of no reputation, and taking upon him the form of a &s;ervant: The com|pany he kept of choice, who were not the rich, and noble, but poor and de&s;pi&s;ed; oblige us to think "his kingdom is not of this world." If he had had in view, a worldly kingdom, depend upon it, he would have proceeded according to worldly maxims. But &s;o far from this, that he treated the riches, the honours, and glories of this world, with manife&s;t indifference. The meanne&s;s of his birth and parentage, at once rendred him the object of contempt: The men he cho&s;e to be his di&s;ciples and followers, were &s;o contemptible in the eyes of the Jews; that he could expect nothing but in|dignity in con&s;equence thereof. Yet this gave him no concern; becau&s;e he came into the world to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;piritual kingdom. And he had no|thing to hope for; neither had he any thing to fear, from the men of this world, but what he fore&s;aw, and was able to prevent; provided it would not i&s;&s;ue in the advancement of this his kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="010503_0013_0F80185DED264DC8">HOWEVER the Jews found fault with Chri&s;t, de|&s;pi&s;ed him and &s;et him at naught on this account; you chri&s;tians &s;ee a coincidence between every part of his <HI>conduct,</HI> and his <HI>de&s;ign</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;piri|tual kingdom. From the beginning of his life, to the end of it, he con&s;tantly convinced us, that he came not to &s;eek the favour and honours of men. And as to his di&s;ciples, they willingly left all to follow him; ri&s;qued their lives in the pro|motion of his divine religion; and gave repeated, indi&s;putable evidences that "by patient continu|ance in well-doing, they &s;ought for glory, and im|mortality; eternal life." "They reckoned that the &s;ufferings of this pre&s;ent time, were not worthy to be compared with the glory that &s;hould be re|vealed in them." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 8.18.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">III. WHILE we con&s;ider the doctrines them|&s;elves; their &s;pecial influence on the heart and life; and the glorious pro&s;pect they give us be|yond the grave; we are confident they are from heaven.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE doctrines them&s;elves: Such as a Trinity of per&s;ons, in the unity of the divine e&s;&s;ence&mdash;The incarnation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash;Ju&s;tification by faith: Or righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed without works. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 4.6.</NOTE> The de&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t, and his powerful energy in changing the &s;inner's heart, and carrying on the work of &s;anctification in believers: The in|dwelling of this Holy Spirit, together with his bearing witne&s;s with the believer's &s;pirit, that he is a child of God; and thus &s;weetly &s;ealing him unto
<PB N="15" REF="010503_0014_0F80185EB0B0B8C0">
the day of redemption. The&s;e, and many other great and precious truths, which it never en<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">d into the heart of man to conceive, till they were &s;et before us in the go&s;pel, demand our faith. Their importance, &amp; &s;ublimity, will at once &s;trike the devout mind; and he readily acknowledge they bear a divine &s;ignature. I think I may &s;afely &s;ay, They never would have been thought of by men, if they had not been revealed in the go&s;pel; it be|ing ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, that man &s;hould invent, what he could not afterward fully comprehend: Which is particularly true of the doctrine of the Trinity, and the incarnation of the Son of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS go&s;pel has a &s;pecial influence on the heart, and life. It begins with the heart; laying the ax to the root of the tree. "It comes with power, the Holy Gho&s;t, and much a&s;&s;urance." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s;. 1.5.</NOTE> Hence the man becomes a new creature, old things pa&s;s away, and all things become new. The na|tural enmity is &s;lain, and the image of Chri&s;t form|ed in the &s;oul. This great change is called rege|neration: And in whom&s;oever it is wrought, there are new apprehen&s;ions of divine things&mdash;new feel|ings&mdash;"Joy and peace in believing."&mdash;There will al&s;o be a different conduct. "The grace of God that bringeth &s;alvation, hath appeared unto all men; teaching us that denying ungodline&s;s, and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent world." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tit. 2.11, 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>THERE is no part of a chri&s;tian's conduct, while he acts in that character, but what is under the
<PB N="16" REF="010503_0015_0F80185F6CA57568">
influence of this go&s;pel. It influentially inclines him to the whole of his duty; to pay an unre&s;er|ved obedience to every divine precept: In a word, <HI>To do ju&s;tly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God.</HI></P>
<P>ITS &s;pecial influence al&s;o on the believer's mind, at once di&s;covers that it is of divine origin. How does it rai&s;e his affections from this world, and fix them on things above? He will have his conver&s;ation in heaven, and dwell on high. For this go&s;pel immediately tends to make him &s;piri|tually minded. That high reli&s;h, with which he formerly gra&s;ped after the things of time, &s;ub&s;ides, in con&s;equence of his feeling the power of the go&s;|pel of Chri&s;t. Such an one &s;ees that God is his portion; that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Alpha and Omega of his happine&s;s; that heaven is his home! Here then will his captivated &s;oul re&s;t infinitely &s;atisfied; and the world appear as a very little thing. For at the &s;ame time that the go&s;pel leads the believer to &s;oar above created good; it al&s;o, in the hands of the divine Spirit, promotes his "meetne&s;s for the enjoyment of the inheritance of the &s;aints in light." And this it does, as it &s;ets before him the infinite evil of &s;in; making it appear "exceeding &s;inful:" The intrin&s;ic beauty of holine&s;s; which as it is e&s;&s;ential to God, &s;o, to every devout &s;oul, it is a plea&s;ing part of the divine character. The former he abhors, and groans under; the latter he longs for, and follows after. Yea &s;o fervent, and ince&s;&s;ant are the de&s;ires of the heaven-born-&s;oul, that he cannot be contented while there are the &s;malle&s;t remains of &s;in in him: Nothing will &s;atisfy him &s;hort of perfect holine&s;s.</P>

Without this "good news" from heaven, death would indeed be a <HI>leap in the dark.</HI> "We &s;hould, as alas the heathen do, grope for the wall like the blind, and grope as if we had no eyes; we &s;hould &s;tumble at noon-day as in the night; and be in de&s;olate places as dead men." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 59.10.</NOTE> Con&s;ider the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the heathen world; which be|ing without the go&s;pel, is in gro&s;s darkne&s;s: While to us "the light is come, and the glory of the Lord is ri&s;en upon us."

<P N="4">IV. I MIGHT add, That the manner in which this news has been conveyed to us, further &s;hew|eth us that it is from heaven, viz. By God Him|&s;elf&mdash;by immediate in&s;piration&mdash;and by the mini|&s;try of angels. But here I &s;hall not enlarge, le&s;t I anticipate what more properly belongs to the next general head. I therefore pa&s;s to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, By what methods the Lord hath been plea&s;ed to make known to us his glorious go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT all lay hid in the divine mind till the a|po&s;tacy. Man's fall introduced the nece&s;&s;ity of the recovery, and opened a door for the revelation of it. Which was fir&s;t made to Adam, by God Him&s;elf, Gen. 3.15. "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy &s;eed and her &s;eed: It &s;hall brui&s;e thy head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heel." The&s;e words are to be viewed in a twofold light, as a threatning to the &s;erpent, and as a pro|mi&s;e to Adam. This may appear by a &s;hort com|ment on the ver&s;e. The "&s;eed of the woman" no doubt de&s;igns Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is &s;aid in the New
<PB N="19" REF="010503_0018_0F801861ACADE1A8">
Te&s;tament to be "made of a woman." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. 4.4.</NOTE> As for the enmity &s;poken of, it has always been obvious, between the "&s;eed of the woman," Chri&s;t, and all his &s;piritual &s;eed believers; and the old &s;erpent, the devil, and his &s;eed the children of di&s;obedience. It appeared &s;o early as the days of Cain, who &s;lew his brother Abel, for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e "his own works were evil, and his brother's righ|teous." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. 3.13.</NOTE> The &s;ame &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition now reigns in the brea&s;ts of the unregenerate. It follows, "He &s;hall brui&s;e thy head." Chri&s;t the "&s;eed of the woman" hath &s;lain the old &s;erpent, "and brui&s;ed &s;atan under his feet." <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 16.20.</NOTE>&mdash; Note, Chri&s;t is to brui&s;e the head of the &s;erpent; which intends nothing le&s;s than his ab&s;olute con|que&s;t over him Accordingly Paul &s;peaks of his "de&s;troying him that had the power of death, that is, the devil." <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 2.14.</NOTE></P>
<P>YOU al&s;o take notice, that the &s;erpent is to "brui&s;e his heel." To brui&s;e the heel is not dan|gerous; life is not at &s;take. From hence we learn, that at mo&s;t &s;atan can only trouble, hara&s;s and di&s;|tre&s;s the children of God: Whom he &s;hall never be able to de&s;troy. "Becau&s;e I live, &s;aid Chri&s;t, ye &s;hall live al&s;o." <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">I have con&s;idered the heel as de&s;igning the members of Chri&s;t, who are often brui&s;ed by &s;atan; of whom it is ju&s;tly &s;aid "That he goes about like a roaring lion, &s;eeking whom he may devour." Though at the &s;ame time allowing, <Q>That the heel may rather de&s;ign the human nature of Chri&s;t, which is his inferior and lowe&s;t nature, and who was in it frequently expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults, temptations and per&s;ecutions of &s;atan, and was at la&s;t brought to a painful and accur&s;ed death; though by dying he got an entire victory over him, and all his Enemies, and obtained &s;alvation for his people.</Q>

<P><PB N="20" REF="010503_0019_0F801863E34F8148">THIS was the fir&s;t intimation of "good news from a far country." It was afterward repeated to Abraham, Gen. 22.18. "And in thy &s;eed &s;hall all the families of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed." After that to I&s;aac in the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions, Gen. 26.4.&mdash;Then to Jacob, Gen. 28.14. After which we find it made known to Judah, by Jacob; when in a &s;pirit of prophecy he ble&s;&s;ed his &s;ons, Gen. 49.10. "The &s;ceptre &s;hall not depart from Judah, nor the law-giver from between his feet, until SHILOH come, and unto Him &s;hall the gathering of the people be." So we might proceed thro' the whole old te&s;tament; &s;hewing when, by whom, and how the Lord hath made known to us this "great &s;alva|tion." But you, who read your Bibles, cannot, methinks be ignorant that all the prophets bore witne&s;s to the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah," who was to be cut off, but not for him&s;elf." David, I&s;aiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Zechariah, Malachi, and the other prophets &s;poke concerning Je&s;us, as they at "&s;undry times were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 1.1.</NOTE> David foretold the manner of his death&mdash;"They pierced my hands and my feet."&mdash;I&s;aiah is with propriety &s;tiled the evangelic prophet." In what moving language does he, &s;even hundred years before our Saviour's birth, de&s;cribe his dolorous &s;ufferings? And the nearer the time approached
<PB N="21" REF="010503_0020_0F80186465D26B38">
for the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s to irradiate our be|nighted world, the clearer did the prophets expre&s;s them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">II. THIS "good news" was made known to us, not only by clear prophecies, but a variety of &s;ig|nificant types and figures. Such as, The Scape-Goat&mdash;the Brazen Serpent&mdash;the Pa&s;chal Lamb&mdash; &s;laying of Bea&s;ts&mdash;many Wa&s;hings, &amp;c. All the&s;e things had an important meaning to the Jewi&s;h wor&s;hippers. Some of our modern Divines, have termed the Ceremonial law, the go&s;pel of the Old Te&s;tament. The Scape-Goat was doubtle&s;s typi|cal of Chri&s;t, and the transferring of Guilt from the elect to him. And that in &s;o eminent a man|ner, that he that runs may read. "And Aaron &s;hall lay his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confe&s;s over him all the iniquities of the chil|dren of I&s;rael, and all their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions in all their &s;ins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and &s;hall &s;end him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderne&s;s. And the goat &s;hall bear upon him all their iniquities, unto a land not inhabit|ed." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Levit. 16.21, 22.</NOTE> Here Guilt was typically transferred to the goat, which he bore away into a land not inhabited. This pointed to Chri&s;t; concerning whom I&s;aiah &s;aith&mdash;"The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 53.6.</NOTE> With which agree the words of Peter, "Who his own &s;elf bare our &s;ins in his own body on the tree."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 2.24.</NOTE></P>
<P>AS for the Brazen Serpent, Je&s;us Chri&s;t accom|modates it to Him&s;elf; "As Mo&s;es lifted up the &s;erpent in the wilderne&s;s, &s;o mu&s;t the Son of Man be lifted up. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">John 3.14.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="010503_0021_0F801864B02E0F88">THE u&s;e that was made of the blood of the &s;a|crifices, and their various wa&s;hings, all pointed to the "blood of &s;prinkling;" that precious "blood that clean&s;eth from all &s;in." This part of the &s;ub|ject is copious, but I mu&s;t not enlarge. Let the&s;e hints convince us, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was held forth to the Old Te&s;tament &s;aints by the&s;e types and figures.</P>
<P N="3">III. WHEN Chri&s;t had actually come in the fle&s;h, the mini&s;try of angels was employed to make it known. "And the angel &s;aid unto them, fear not: For behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Chri&s;t the Lord.&mdash;And &s;uddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly ho&s;t prai&s;ing God, and &s;aying, "Glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on earth peace, good will towards men." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke 2.10&mdash;15.</NOTE> See, the angels are in exta&s;y at the Sa|viour's birth; though not intere&s;ted in it! "This good news from a far country, was more refre&s;h|ing than cold waters to a thir&s;ty &s;oul." Good old Simeon was heard to &s;ay, "Lord now lette&s;t thou thy &s;ervant depart in peace, according to thy word. For mine eyes have &s;een thy &s;alvation: Which thou ha&s;t prepared before the face of all people: A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people I&s;rael." Stop my &s;oul and wonder!&mdash; Are angels all in raptures at this good news? Do they willingly de&s;cend to bring the tidings of &s;al|vation; when they want no Saviour? And what is the matter with them to whom it is brought;
<PB N="23" REF="010503_0022_0F80186572F52A80">
and are concerned in it for life or death eternal, that they are no more affected with it?&mdash;That they are not anxious to equal angels in their prai&s;es?&mdash; Oh that we had angels tongues, and the warm heart of Simeon, then &s;hould we in heavenly &s;trains &s;ing "glory to God in the highe&s;t!"</P>
<P N="4">IV. WHEN Chri&s;t grew up, he entred on the mini&s;try in per&s;on; and according to I&s;aiah's pro|phecy, he went about "to preach good tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken hearted, to pro|claim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the pri&s;on to them that were bound." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 61.1.</NOTE> And he engaged many di&s;ciples to tread in his &s;teps; to whom he gave commi&s;&s;ion to "go into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature." Who after his death, re&s;urrection, and a&s;cen&s;ion; having received the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, went forth in his name, declaring with all boldne&s;s, That "He was the true Me&s;&s;iah, whom they with wicked hands had crucified, and &s;lain." And great was the &s;ucce&s;s that immediately at|tended their faithful mini&s;trations. "And the word of God increa&s;ed; and the number of the di&s;ciples multiplied in Jeru&s;alem greatly; and a great company of the prie&s;ts were obedient to the faith." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts 6.7.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND &s;ince the days of the apo&s;tles, the Lord hath taken care to &s;upply his churches &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, with a number of faithful men to preach his glo|rious go&s;pel. "May the Lord of the harve&s;t, &s;end forth more labourers into his harve&s;t!" "Faithful men that &s;hall be able to teach others al&s;o!"</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="010503_0023_0F8018662F548038">THUS we &s;ee how this good news has been con|veyed to us. We joyfully conclude from the&s;e con|&s;iderations, that it is from heaven. I pa&s;s to the</P>
<P>THIRD thing propo&s;ed, which is to &s;hew that this is news indeed; and emphatically "good news."</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is news indeed, as it was never heard of, never thought of, by angels or men, till revealed. The apo&s;tle calls it, "the my&s;tery which hath been hid from ages, and from generations." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Colo&s;&s;. 1.26.</NOTE> Who could have thought of a gracious promi&s;e of re|demption, and forgivene&s;s, as &s;oon as man had &s;inned?&mdash;Had we not ju&s;t rea&s;on to indulge a "fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery in|dignation?"&mdash;Who could have imagined that God &s;hould "&s;o love this guilty world, as to give his only begotten &s;on, that who&s;oever believeth in him, might not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life?" Who could have believed it, if the report were not di|vine, that "Je&s;us Chri&s;t freely gave him&s;elf a ran|&s;om for us?"&mdash;That he a&s;&s;umed human nature, in order "that he might have &s;omewhat to offer?"&mdash; That he conde&s;cended "to be made like unto his brethren; that he might be a merciful and faith|ful high-prie&s;t, in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the &s;ins of the people?"&mdash; That he obeyed the law in his life, and became obedient unto death, "even the death of the cro&s;s?"&mdash;That he laid in the grave until the third day, when he &s;ealed his religion by ri&s;ing again?&mdash; And finally, that he a&s;cended up on high; and now, while I am preaching, and you are hearing,
<PB N="25" REF="010503_0024_0F801866EC1D9FF8">
he appears our advocate with the Father. "Where he ever lives to make interce&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Oh love di|vine!&mdash;Wi&s;dom infinite! Who of you is not lo&s;t in the&s;e wonders of redeeming love? It is as high as heaven, what can we do? May our hearts burn within us, while we contemplate this "news" from heaven; this revelation that God hath given of his Son!</P>
<P N="2">II. This go&s;pel is new always. You that have known the truth, twenty, thirty, forty years; yet di&s;cover fre&s;h wonders in Chri&s;t and his &s;alvation. The half has never been told you, of the Glory, Beauty, Fulne&s;s, Love, Compa&s;&s;ion, of this once crucified Je&s;us. "He is altogether lovely, and the chiefe&s;t among ten thou&s;and." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cant. 5.10.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">III. THE &s;aints will find &s;omething new in this divine, and inexhau&s;tible &s;ubject, when they arrive at glory. Now they know in part; they &s;ee thro' a gla&s;s darkly; but then they &s;hall know even as they are known; and &s;ee face to face. Then &s;hall they under&s;tand infinitely more of the &s;overeignty, the ju&s;tice, the wi&s;dom of God in this oeconomy of redemption; and eternally &s;ing the "new &s;ong."</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o emphatically "good news," if we con|&s;ider who is the author of it. It is good as to its contents, "peace on earth, and good will towards men." A Saviour born; &s;alvation for the great|e&s;t &s;inners. "A fountain opened to the hou&s;e of David, and to the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem for &s;in, and for uncleanne&s;s:" Pardon of &s;in: Peace of
<PB N="26" REF="010503_0025_0F80186940389078">
con&s;cience: Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t&mdash;Support to believers in death; and everla&s;ting life in the future world.</P>
<P>IT is good as it makes men good. Saul no &s;ooner feels the power of this go&s;pel, than he de|&s;i&s;ts from per&s;ecuting, and "preaches the faith which before he de&s;troyed." Zaccheus is at once inclined, by a &s;ecret, but powerful influence to re|&s;tore four fold to every one, from whom he might have taken any thing by fal&s;e accu&s;ation. Mag|dalene will in a moment for&s;ake her atrocious ini|quities, and follow Je&s;us. The jaylor in&s;tantly wa&s;hes the &s;tripes he had made, but a few minutes before. In truth, when it comes with power, it makes great &s;aints of great &s;inners.</P>
<P>ONCE more. It is good. i. e. it is plea&s;ant, as it brings ea&s;e to a guilty con&s;cience; con&s;olation to them that are ca&s;t down. Which naturally leads us to the</P>
<P>FOURTH general dead: That this good news from heaven, is more welcome to the heavy-laden &s;inner, and the true believer thir&s;ting after God, than cold waters are to any one athir&s;t.</P>
<P>WHAT good news is, my Brethren, you know: You this moment feel. How long have we anxi|ou&s;ly waited the great event, that is now deter|mined in our favour? How tedious was every day till the intere&s;ting news arrived? What gloomi|ne&s;s appeared in every face? How was bu&s;ine&s;s &s;tagnated? And how painful were the exerci&s;es of our &s;u&s;pended minds? But the &s;cene is altered;
<PB N="27" REF="010503_0026_0F80186A3A212638">
and gladne&s;s fills our brea&s;ts; and would &s;oon &s;hew it&s;elf in every look, did not the &s;olemnity of this day and place demand a &s;erious countenance. It gives a &s;pring to action&mdash;a plea&s;ure to the man in bu&s;ine&s;s; and we hope will &s;peedily revive e|very branch of trade. "As cold waters to a thir&s;ty &s;oul: So is this good news from a far country"&mdash; But infinitely more exhilerating is this good news from heaven;</P>
<P N="1">I. TO the &s;inner &s;en&s;ible of &s;in, burdened with it, fearing the wrath of God, and everla&s;ting mi&s;|ery; ready to give up all hope, lie down and die: For &s;uch an one to be told of a way of recovery to the divine favour&mdash;in which God can be ju&s;t, and ju&s;tify him that believeth; how greatly will it encourage him? But for him to have a be|lieving view of Chri&s;t, as the go&s;pel &s;ets him forth, in the perfection of his divine righteou&s;|ne&s;s&mdash;his infinite atonement&mdash;the riches&mdash;free|ne&s;s and &s;overeignty of his grace; as &s;aving the chief of &s;inners&mdash;ju&s;tifying the ungodly; (which is one of the glories of the go&s;pel)&mdash;How will he perceive his load of guilt removed;&mdash;be brought to tru&s;t his immortal all in the hands of this divine Redeemer; and have "joy and peace in believing?" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 15.13.</NOTE> Suppo&s;e a criminal at the place of execution, &s;tanding on the verge of eternity;; death &s;taring him in the face, to be pre&s;ented with a reprieve: How will it overjoy and melt him down?

<PB N="28" REF="010503_0027_0F80186AB08B3348">
with Je&s;us Chri&s;t? Infinitely more tran&s;porting is this good news to &s;uch a &s;oul!</P>
<P N="2">II. IT is &s;o to the real believer in all his after life. "He thir&s;ts for God, for the living God." And the go&s;pel is the medium in which he &s;ees Him. In it "God is &s;aid to be in Chri&s;t." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 5.19.</NOTE> The believer could no more live as a chri&s;tian, without this go&s;pel; than he could at fir&s;t believe without it. It is the joy and rejoicing of his heart. It is to his &s;oul, what food is to the body. He feeds upon it; hence he grows in grace. "To know Chri&s;t and him crucified," is his invariable re&s;olu|tion. A crucified Je&s;us, is to him a theme ever new, and ever welcome. And if at times, he gets at a di&s;tance from God, and &s;inks into a &s;tate of lukewarmne&s;s; which is alas too frequently the ca&s;e, nothing but a looking to Je&s;us as exhibited in this go&s;pel, can re&s;tore to him his wonted &s;en&s;e of divine things. "I live, &s;ays Paul, yet not I, but Chri&s;t liveth in me." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. 2.20.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHAT remains, is an improvement of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. WHAT rea&s;on have we to ble&s;s God for the go&s;pel? It is an invaluable ble&s;&s;ing. "Ble&s;&s;ed, &s;ays David, are they that hear the joyful &s;ound." You have heard of its influence on the heart and life; and have been reminded this day of the glo|rious pro&s;pect it gives believers beyond the grave. Doubtle&s;s every devout mind will be rai&s;ed; and every mouth filled with the language of gratitude, &s;aying, "We thank thee, O Father, Lord of hea|ven
<PB N="29" REF="010503_0028_0F80186B73CF2B18">
and earth, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them unto babes. Even &s;o Father, for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. 11.25, 26.</NOTE> Sure &s;uch privileges as ours, call for thankfulne&s;s. And it might have a ten|dency to promote it, were we to con&s;ider the happy &s;tate of the chri&s;tian world, in contra&s;t with that of the heathen. To do this we need not go far. Behold, my Hearers, with compa&s;&s;ion, the Savages on our own continent. They &s;it in dark|ne&s;s and have no light. How barbarous, and in|human are many of their cu&s;toms? They are ig|norant of the "true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent." While we who are but a few miles from them, are &s;urrounded with the means of grace. This is a favour we enjoy in a &s;overeign manner. "Whence is it, that thou wilt mani|fe&s;t thy&s;elf unto us, and not unto the world?"</P>
<P>THE go&s;pel has a tendency, even when it does not change the heart, to inform the judgment; to &s;often the con&s;cience; and to lay &s;inners under &s;ome re&s;traints which they cannot ea&s;ily get over. In this re&s;pect it influences the practice even of the unregenerate. We all know that tho&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions, that were made on the mind in younger life, by a religious education, are not ea&s;ily de|faced. And if &s;uch, when they grow up, would ca&s;t off all regard to their education, and endulge every vicious de&s;ire; they find they cannot do it at once; con&s;cience &s;tands ready to reprove and to condemn. Viewing the go&s;pel then in this light, we have cau&s;e to ble&s;s God for it. But when
<PB N="30" REF="010503_0029_0F80186C49EDF630">
it becomes the power of God, unto &s;alvation, to us, or ours; we &s;hall have matter of endle&s;s prai&s;e.</P>

IF the go&s;pel is from heaven, and is &s;o important in its nature, tendency and de&s;ign;&mdash; if we as poor, &s;inful, apo&s;tate creatures, are &s;o immediately intere&s;ted in it; how may we rea&s;on|ably expect it will be received and entertained? Surely with the highe&s;t gratitude, and the warm|e&s;t love. But alas how contrary the treatment it meets with from Infidels and hardened &s;inners! The Dei&s;t pours contempt upon it, and all its votaries. The &s;ecure &s;inner turns his back upon it, &s;aying, "What is your Beloved more than another Beloved?" And many of tho&s;e who have been favoured with the go&s;pel all their days, re|main in a &s;tate of obduracy and impenitence; and that too where they have &s;at under the mo&s;t &s;oul-&s;earching mini&s;try.</P>
<P>FROM hence we &s;ee the depravity of human nature: And are per&s;uaded that the &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;pel now, as well as in the fir&s;t ages of the Church, depends ab&s;olutely upon the powerful operations of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. HERE the heavy-laden &s;inner beholds re|lief. It is this go&s;pel only that can heal a wound|ed con&s;cience. "The letter killeth, but the &s;pi|rit giveth life." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cor. 3.6.</NOTE> All that the law can do, is to &s;hew the &s;inner his danger; that he is in lo&s;t and peri&s;hing circum&s;tances; but it neither points to, nor can it admini&s;ter any relief. It is the go&s;|pel of Chri&s;t only, that exhibits a righteou&s;ne&s;s

that an&s;wers to the perfection of the divine law. And &s;inners in this condition &s;ee, that the holy, perfect law of God, will di&s;pen&s;e with nothing le&s;s than perfection. "Till heaven and earth pa&s;s, one jot or one tittle &s;hall in no wi&s;e pa&s;s from the law, till all be fulfilled." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. 5.18.</NOTE> Here then the go&s;pel is more welcome than cold waters to a thir&s;ty &s;oul, ina&s;much as it &s;ets Chri&s;t before us, as the "end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 10.4.</NOTE> This is the balm of Gilead: And Je&s;us is the divine phy&s;ician, who&s;e "blood &s;peaketh better things than the blood of Abel," <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 12.24.</NOTE> to every &s;in-burdened &s;oul.</P>
<P>I SHALL now di&s;mi&s;s you, with an addre&s;s &s;uited to the pre&s;ent joyful occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>MY Brethren, I have long wi&s;hed for, and now with plea&s;ure embrace the fir&s;t opportunity, to congratulate you on a mo&s;t important event: An event that &s;pread gladne&s;s through Britain (a few excepted) and that cannot fail of warming every true American's heart. Should I &s;peak more plainly, your joy might become impetuous; and like the Nile overflow its banks. Look upon it as a royal confirmation of your civil and religious liberties;&mdash;the&s;e &s;tand in immediate connection with each other: In&s;omuch that the very act that leaves you in the enjoyment of the one, may be looked upon as confirming to you the other.</P>
<P>THIS whole a&s;&s;embly&mdash;yea the whole Briti&s;h America is intere&s;ted in this great deci&s;ion. Great You will readily conclude, from what You have &s;een during the la&s;t &s;even months. I can com|pare

our pre&s;ent &s;tate to nothing with more pro|priety, than a &s;erene &s;ky, and the &s;miling &s;un, after a horrid tempe&s;t. Receive it as a favour from the be&s;t of earthly Monarchs; and always deeply im|pre&s;s your minds, with the belief, that our mo&s;t gracious Sovereign is the father of his people; and that we, his mo&s;t faithful &s;ubjects in America, have no &s;mall &s;hare in his royal affections. Your de&s;ire is granted&mdash;your burden removed;&mdash;and you left to enjoy your privileges.</P>
<P>YOU are flu&s;hed with joy: It is a joyful oc|ca&s;ion. A propriety of conduct under this occur|rence, I am confident you will all think nece&s;&s;ary. And the more danger we are in of imprudence, as we are almo&s;t intoxicated with gladne&s;s. Bear with me, while I &s;ay, That fir&s;t, and &s;upremely you &s;hould offer your unfeigned thank&s;givings to the Lord, who reigns in the moral world, in that He hath inclined the King and Briti&s;h Parliament, to deal favourably with us:&mdash;That He hath rai&s;ed up in his kind providence, Friends to the cau&s;e of liberty and the&s;e colonies. In &s;hort, that we have obtained redre&s;s&mdash;"Let the people prai&s;e thee, O Lord; let all the people prai&s;e thee!"</P>
<P>LET us entertain the mo&s;t dutiful and loyal &s;entiments with re&s;pect to the King&mdash;rejoice in his upright admini&s;tration&mdash;the increa&s;e of his illu&s;trious family, as a further &s;ecurity of our happy con&s;titution: And not fail by words and actions, to di&s;cover that the pro&s;perity of his king|dom is a great part of our happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="010503_0032_0F80186E8598EC20">MAY the Briti&s;h Parliament receive that defer|ence from us that they de&s;erve; and be convinced by our future conduct, that we aim not at IN|DEPENDENCY; nor wi&s;h to de&s;troy di&s;tinctions, where di&s;tinctions are nece&s;&s;ary:&mdash;That we re|joice in being governed according to the principles of that con&s;titution, of which we make our boa&s;t as Engli&s;hmen: Yea further, that if it was put to our choice, Whether our connections with Great Britain &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved? We, the inhabitants of the&s;e Colonies, would ri&s;e like a cloud, and deprecate &s;uch a di&s;union.</P>
<P>LET the names of tho&s;e Worthies who have openly e&s;pou&s;ed our cau&s;e, be had in grateful re|membrance; not only by the pre&s;ent, but by all &s;ucceeding generations.</P>
<P>BUT I forbear to addre&s;s you in language that &s;eems to imply any want of gratitude and affection to them: And with confidence affirm, in the be|half of You, my Brethren, and the re&s;t of my Countrymen, that your generous hearts would in&s;tantly prompt you, were your abilities &s;uffici|ent, to erect &s;tatues of Gold, to the memory of the Right Hon.

<P>TO conclude. Be it far from us to triumph on this happy event, as tho' we had gained a victory: Or even remotely to hint that our redre&s;s is forced. Sen&s;ible we are that &s;ome of the friends of the&s;e Colonies, have gone &s;o far, as to ri&s;que their repu|tation

on our becoming behaviour for the future. May they not be di&s;appointed! But while we en|tertain the warme&s;t &s;en&s;e of liberty, may we act in every in&s;tance, in &s;uch a manner, that our mo&s;t &s;ubtle enemies may have nothing to lay to our charge: Unle&s;s they may deem it a fault, to be inviolably attached to his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t &s;acred per&s;on; and the royal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Hanover.</P>
<P>IN fine.

May the whole i&s;&s;ue in unanimity and peace; the firme&s;t connection, and mutual pro&s;perity of Great-Britain and her Colonies.&mdash; May we go on to rejoice in the continuance of our privileges, and glorify God in the abundance of his mercy.</P>
