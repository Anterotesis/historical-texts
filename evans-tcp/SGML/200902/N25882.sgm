<SALUTE>Dear Friends and Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY ancient love, if you can believe it, reaches to you, as in times pa&s;t, and years, that are gone, even, in the divine root and prin|ciple of love and life, that made us near to one another, above all worldly con&s;iderations; where our life, I hope, is hid with Chri&s;t, in God, our Father; &s;o that, when he appears, we &s;hall al&s;o appear with him, in glory; and in the meantime, through us, to tho&s;e that love and wait for his appearance, as the de&s;ire of nations; that we may glorify God, his and our everla&s;ting Father, in our bodies, &s;ouls and &s;pirits, in tempo|ral and eternal affairs; being indeed none of our own; fora&s;much as we are our own, we are none of the Lord's; a great my&s;tery, but a great truth, and of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to witne&s;s, to be of the number of the cho&s;en nation, the peculiar people, and royal prie&s;thood of Chri&s;t, and his glorious kingdom.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear friends, let all below this keep on the left hand; and wait to feel tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed things, to inherit right hand; and in faith and courage, cry aloud to the Lord, for his renewing and refre&s;hing power, that may revive and reform his work upon your hearts and minds; and our humility, meekne&s;s, patience, &s;elf-denial and charity, with a blame|le&s;s walking, may plainly appear, and manife&s;t the work of God upon our hearts, to tho&s;e that are without; which is not only the way to bring up the loiterers, and gather in the carele&s;s ones, to their duty, but fetch home and bring in, the &s;trangers, and the very enemies of the ble&s;&s;ed truth, to confe&s;s and acknowledge that God is in you, and for you, of a truth.</P>
<P>Now, my dear friends, as to outward things, I have &s;ent a new Go|vernor, of years and experience; of a quiet, ea&s;y temper; that, I hope, will give offence to none; nor too ea&s;ily put up any, if offered him, with|out hope of amendment. The Queen very graciou&s;ly approved of him, at fir&s;t offer, and gave him her hand to ki&s;s; and, at la&s;t, being intro|duced by the Earl of <HI>Godolphin,</HI> Lord High Trea&s;urer of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> &s;he added, <HI>"Sir, I wi&s;h you a good journey, and &s;hall be ready to &s;erve you."</HI> He is &s;ober, under&s;tands to command and obey, moderate in his temper, and of what they call a good family: his grandfather, Sir <HI>Vincent Gookin,</HI> having been an early great planter in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in King <HI>James</HI> the fir&s;t, and the fir&s;t Charles's days; and he intends, if not ill treated, to lay his bones, as well as &s;ub&s;tance among you; having taken leave of the war, and both <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> to live among&s;t you; and as he is not voluptuous, &s;o, I hope, he will be an example of thriftine&s;s. In &s;hort, he has in&s;tructions, as much to the virtue, ju&s;tice and peace of the country, as I can expre&s;s my&s;elf, or you de&s;ire, for your comfortable living; pray, therefore, receive him kindly, and expre&s;s it, by a mode&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; or, rather, give it me, to give him, or, how you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Lovelace,</HI> Governor of <HI>New York,</HI> and a promi&s;ing one indeed, pre&s;&s;es, and the Admiral's orders, for &s;ailing, are gone down; the wind fair, and Governor <HI>Gookin</HI> leaves me to-morrow.</P>
<P>I earne&s;tly be&s;eech you to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>James Logan,</HI> and who el&s;e the Tru&s;tees, for the payment of the money here advanced, &s;hall nominate, not only to get in, but turn into money, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be&s;t you are able, that I may come honourable to you, and &s;peedily; which I hope to do, as &s;oon as you, and the&s;e friends here, think fit. Let me have this pledge of your love, and it &s;hall be a la&s;ting one, to advi&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;t you for the expediting the matter; for be a&s;&s;ured, I long to be with you; and, if the Lord bring me and mine well there, I hope not to return on almo&s;t any terms, at lea&s;t not without your advice and &s;atisfaction; for care of you, and &s;ettling plantations for my poor minors; for planters, God willing, they &s;hall be, in their father's country, rather than great merchants, in their native land; and to vi&s;it friends throughout the continent, at lea&s;t, their chiefe&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t love I leave you and yours, and all the Lord's people among&s;t you; my family and affairs, to the merciful providence and or|derings of our great and gracious God, that welcomed us, in poor <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> with his excellent love and pre&s;ence, and will, I hope, once more, and remain your loving and faithful friend,</P>

<P>HAVING this opportunity, we can do no le&s;s than congratulate thy &s;ea&s;onable acce&s;&s;ion to this government, and render our mo&s;t grateful acknow|ledgments to the Queen, for her gracious accep|tance of the Proprietary's nomination of thee, to &s;upply his ab&s;ence, and to him, for con&s;tituting a per&s;on of &s;o fair a character, furni&s;hed, as we hope, with a full re&s;olution, as well as power, to

redre&s;s the grievances, and remove the oppre&s;&s;ions, that this poor province has, for &s;ome time, labour|ed under, occa&s;ioned by the irregular admini&s;tra|tion of the late Deputy Governor; who was too much influenced by <HI>evil coun&s;el;</HI> to which the mi|&s;eries and confu&s;ion of the &s;tate, and divi&s;ions in the government, are principally owing.</P>
<P>We are ready to repre&s;ent &s;uch of tho&s;e public grievances, as are laid before us, or occur to our knowledge, in particular articles, and bring them to a proper examen; but, perceiving by thy me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;e ye&s;terday, that thou art not ready, at this time, to proceed with us to bu&s;ine&s;s, we &s;hall take leave only to mention &s;ome of tho&s;e things, of which the public weal of this country loudly calls for a mo&s;t earne&s;t application and &s;peedy re|dre&s;s.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, we are to lay before thee, that of the <HI>fal&s;e alarm</HI> in May, 1706; wherein the late Governor was chief actor; and for which he is highly chargeable; having &s;hot at the Queen's &s;ubjects, putting many of the inhabitants of this town in danger of their lives, and forced great quantities of powder and lead from the owners, and gave it to &s;uch as wa&s;ted it, when he knew there was no occa&s;ion to u&s;e it; whereby he deprived the place of what ammunition might be ready for tho&s;e, that had freedom to make u&s;e of it, for their defence, in ca&s;e of an attack.</P>
<P>The next is that notorious act of ho&s;tility, he committed by firing &s;hot at the Queen's &s;ubjects pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> in the river, upon their law|ful trade, to and from this port.</P>
<P>We mention the&s;e, as they are, in our opi|nion, offences of a deep dye, and committed again&s;t the Queen's crown and dignity, as well as again&s;t the peace, and ought to be charged upon

<P>That the Trea&s;urer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Viz. S.

<P>That the courts of judicature of this pro|vince have been, and are, erected by ordinances of the Governor and Council, again&s;t the advice, and without the a&s;&s;ent of the A&s;&s;embly; which we <HI>complain</HI> of, as a <HI>great oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> and aggriev|ance to the people, we repre&s;ent, and de&s;ire the &s;ame may be &s;peedily redre&s;&s;ed, and the bill pre|pared for the e&s;tabli&s;hing courts, with other u&s;eful bills, ready to be pre&s;ented to the Governor, may be con&s;idered.</P>

<P>Thus, by the A&s;&s;embly's very fir&s;t addre&s;s to Governor <HI>Gookin,</HI> were the former animo&s;ities continued; for the principal and ruling members of the hou&s;e were &s;till the &s;ame, who had &s;o long been accu&s;tomed to complain of grievances, if not to exaggerate, or imagine &s;ome things of that kind; in&s;omuch, that, though they had &s;ufficient rea&s;on to complain of part of Evans's conduct, in proper time and place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The A&s;&s;em|bly &s;hew more of temper than prudence, &amp;c.</NOTE> yet their manner of mentioning &s;ome things under the name of <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>griev|ance,</HI> and in demanding, or urging, for others, &s;uch a mode of &s;atisfaction, as the nature of their ca&s;e rendered impo&s;&s;ible to obtain in the province, par|ticularly tho&s;e re&s;pecting <HI>Evans</HI> and his admini|&s;tration; which, perhaps, would have been more prudently dropped, with the removal of their cau&s;e, &s;eemed to &s;hew more their temper of mind, than prudence: but <HI>Evans</HI>'s ill or imprudent conduct had made &s;uch deep impre&s;&s;ion on their minds, and di&s;po&s;ed them &s;o much to a di&s;contented and angry di&s;po&s;ition, that in &s;ome of their repre&s;en|tations&punc; they appear not only to have exaggerated
<PB N="9" REF="034421_0009_0FFD9E22E7869B48">
what might truly be called grievances, but al&s;o complained of &s;ome things as &s;uch, which, in reality, and according to the laws and con&s;titution, could not properly come under that name.</P>
<P>The Governor's reply to the A&s;&s;embly's addre&s;s is contained in his fir&s;t &s;peech to the hou&s;e, on the 13th of the next month, April, as follows, viz.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It would have proved a much greater &s;atis|faction to me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go|vernor's an|&s;wer to the A&s;&s;embly's addre&s;s.</NOTE> if at this fir&s;t time of my &s;peaking to you, I had nothing to take notice of, but what I my&s;elf might have to lay before you; but your addre&s;s, pre&s;ented to me in March la&s;t, when you &s;ent me notice that you were &s;itting, will, before we proceed to any other bu&s;ine&s;s, require &s;ome an&s;wer; in which I will be plain and &s;hort, as the matter will bear.</P>
<P>I thank you, gentlemen, for your congra|tulations, and do a&s;&s;ure you, that I come with full re&s;olutions, on my part, to employ the power, with which the Proprietary has thought fit to ho|nour me, and her Maje&s;ty has graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to approve of, to render the people of this government as happy and ea&s;y as is po&s;&s;ible for me, in all things, that &s;hall concern their true intere&s;t, and be to their real advantage. I have enquired what might be meant by tho&s;e <HI>aggriev|ances, oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>confu&s;ions,</HI> which you complain of, and what&s;oever I &s;hall meet with, that de&s;erves tho&s;e names, &s;hall have my ready concurrence to remove them, as far as they &s;hall appear; but mu&s;t &s;ay, that, I believe, one effectual method to free all people from the apprehen&s;ions of griev|ances, will be, to lay all former animo&s;ities and jea|lou&s;ies a&s;ide, and, for the future, apply them&s;elves to &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s as they are concerned in, for the public, with a freedom and openne&s;s of temper, and an unbia&s;&s;ed inclination to promote the com|mon
<PB N="10" REF="034421_0010_0FFD9E5873466B48">
good, without any other particular view: if we &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to take example from her Maje&s;ty's glorious admini&s;tration of her domi|nions at home, and that of her parliament, we &s;hould not fail of being extremely happy.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e two pa&s;t actions of my immediate predece&s;&s;or, of which you complain, I can only inform you, that they were both well known in <HI>Britain,</HI> before I left it; and that I had no di|rections to make any enquiry into them; and that, upon the be&s;t advice I can receive here, I find they will not properly fall under my cogni|zance, in the &s;tation I am placed in, and therefore cannot think it fit to concern my&s;elf with them.</P>
<P>But I am obliged to ob&s;erve to you that the Council of the province, now with me, think them&s;elves very unju&s;tly treated by the mention you have made of them, if they (as it is generally under&s;tood) be intended by the <HI>evil coun&s;el,</HI> of which you have taken notice; and therefore, will take the liberty to vindicate them&s;elves, as you will &s;ee, by their application to me; to which I refer you.</P>
<P>The charge again&s;t the Trea&s;urer,* I find, is occa&s;ioned by his and the Council's under&s;tand|ing the act of A&s;&s;embly, by which the money, that comes into his hands, has been granted, &s;omewhat differently from what the <HI>pre&s;ent and late Hou&s;es</HI> of Repre&s;entatives have done: he pleads the law, as his be&s;t direction; and you cannot but agree, that it is fit that this alone (I mean the law) ought to determine the matter. As far as I have hitherto been able, I have pre&s;&s;ed the collection of the taxes, and &s;hall continue the be&s;t of my care, until they be fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The method of e&s;tabli&s;hing courts, by the Governor and Council, was al&s;o well under&s;tood
<PB N="11" REF="034421_0011_0FFD9E4466E79458">
in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and was approved of there, as being grounded on unque&s;tionable powers, grant|ed the Proprietary. The bill formerly propo&s;ed by the A&s;&s;embly, for that purpo&s;e, which is now before the board, has not been allowed of; but &s;eeing the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, which was drawn, as I am informed, according to the plan laid down in that bill, carries &s;ome inconveniencies with it, and requires an alteration, I &s;hall be ready to agree to any other rea&s;onable bill, that you &s;hall hereafter propo&s;e, for &s;ettling courts of judi|cature, in &s;uch a regular method, as may be a la&s;ting rule for holding them.</P>

thought fit to add the&s;e words, <HI>who was too much influenced by evil coun&s;el;</HI> to whom the mi&s;eries and confu&s;ions of the &s;tate, and divi&s;ions in the government, are principally owing.</P>
<P>It was long, may it plea&s;e the Governor, before we could induce our&s;elves to believe, that men, &s;o well acquainted with the characters of mo&s;t of us, in our &s;everal &s;tations, in the country, could po&s;&s;ibly intend us by the charge, until, by the ob&s;ervations of others, we were forced to take a nearer notice of the expre&s;&s;ions; upon which we are &s;orry to find, that the word <HI>coun&s;el,</HI> as there u&s;ed, together with the general con&s;truction of the &s;entence, &s;eems not to admit of any other interpretation, but that to us principally is owing whatever the A&s;&s;embly has thought fit to complain of, or, can reduce, under the general terms they have u&s;ed: if they will di&s;avow any &s;uch intention, we &s;hall crave no other &s;atisfaction; but, if not, we mu&s;t then de&s;ire, that they, and all men con|cerned in the&s;e affairs, may know,</P>
<P>That, notwith&s;tanding the Proprietary and late Lieutenant Governor, according to the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules in all governments what&s;oever, from the mo&s;t polite, to the mo&s;t barbarous, nations in the world, finding them&s;elves under a nece&s;&s;ity of hav|ing a Council about them, to advi&s;e with, in affairs of government, have thought fit to choo&s;e us for that &s;ervice, in which, according to our &s;everal &s;olemn engagements, we have acquitted our|&s;elves, to the be&s;t of our judgments and abilities, yet not one of us receives, or ever expects, any other advantage by it, than the &s;atisfaction of having di&s;charged our duties to the country we live in, and to advance the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of it, as much as may lie in our power. We have no &s;alaries, nor allowance, paid us by the country for this, nor offices of profit, to encourage us;
<PB N="14" REF="034421_0014_0FFD7A0038799888">
what we do is at our own expen&s;e of time, trou|ble and charge, and upon our own e&s;tates is all our dependance, which, giving us as good an in|tere&s;t in the country, as others can pretend to, and being out of the reach of any po&s;&s;ible views different from the good of the whole, no man, without a manife&s;t violence to his rea&s;on, can ima|gine but that we are as much concerned, and, therefore, would be as careful to prevent and divert any <HI>mi&s;eries, confu&s;ions, or divi&s;ions,</HI> that may threat|en the province, as any other &s;ett of men what|&s;oever; &s;o that this charge, from the A&s;&s;embly, if levelled again&s;t us, is not only unju&s;t, but will be judged, we believe, exceedingly ungrateful, by all that impartially con&s;ider us, and our circum|&s;tances, among our neighbours.</P>
<P>After this general accu&s;ation, involving us in all things, that have been irregularly commit|ted, or, that any per&s;on can think &s;o to have been, they enumerate four particulars, which they call <HI>aggrievances.</HI> To the two fir&s;t we have nothing to &s;ay; and we hope no man can believe, that any one of us was &s;o much as privy to them, much le&s;s that we <HI>advi&s;ed</HI> them; we here &s;olemnly declare, each for him&s;elf, that we did not. The other two we acknowledge our&s;elves to be con|cerned in, and &s;hall always ju&s;tify: that is, fir&s;t, That we advi&s;ed the Trea&s;urer to take his directi|ons from the law alone, and without regard to the partial order of the a&s;&s;embly to the contrary, to make his payments in equal portions; which, we hope, cannot be accounted a <HI>grievance:</HI> and in the next, To prevent the greate&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible <HI>grievances,</HI> the want of public ju&s;tice, of which, by the mea&s;ures taken by the A&s;&s;embly of that time, the country was long deprived; we advi&s;ed the Governor to make u&s;e of the powers, with which he was unque&s;tionably ve&s;ted, to open the courts again, and to re&s;tore the courts of ju&s;tice to the
<PB N="15" REF="034421_0015_0FFD9EAD42BF9148">
oppre&s;&s;ed country; which had long langui&s;hed through the want of it, until they could be other|wi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed. Men unacquainted with affairs of this kind, and who mu&s;t take their information from others, may be impo&s;ed on by per&s;ons of de&s;ign, and believe that to be irregular, which, in it&s;elf, is a mo&s;t whole&s;ome and nece&s;&s;ary act; but we can, with a&s;&s;urance, affirm, that we had full &s;atisfaction, from men of the be&s;t abilities, that what we advi&s;ed and concurred in this matter, was regular, ju&s;t and legal.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, may it plea&s;e the Governor, though on the one hand, we &s;hall be exceedingly unwilling to have any mi&s;under&s;tanding with the repre&s;entatives of the people, well knowing it to be an unhappine&s;s, that all rea&s;onable mea&s;ures &s;hould be taken to prevent; yet, on the other, we &s;hall not, by any contrivances, be diverted from di&s;charging the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in us, during our continuance, in this &s;tation, with honour and ju&s;tice, to the be&s;t of our abilities; but, from time to time, &s;hall offer to the Governor &s;uch ad|vice as we &s;hall judge mo&s;t conducive to the gene|ral good of the province; in the welfare of which we are &s;o nearly concerned, in our &s;everal private intere&s;ts; and in the meantime, hope we may ju&s;tly expect to be &s;ecured from calumny and mi&s;repre|&s;entation.</P>

<P>"If the Governor will look back, and duly con&s;ider the complaints and remon&s;trances of the late A&s;&s;emblies, it will appear, that <HI>grievances</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> are words, which are formed upon ju&s;t complaints; and for which the country wants re|dre&s;s; &s;o that what the Governor &s;uppo&s;es, on that head, is not candid towards the repre&s;entatives of the people.</P>
<P>"May it plea&s;e the Governor, whatever might be the occa&s;ion, or de&s;ign, of the la&s;t clau&s;e, in thy &s;peech, we are of opinion, it was not well timed; for if the Secretary's charge, again&s;t our Speaker, had any weight, it &s;hould have been propounded as an objection again&s;t the A&s;&s;embly's choice of him, for Speaker: but, after thou had&s;t declared thy approbation of their choice, that thou &s;hould&s;t be prevailed upon &s;o far to patronize the Secretary's in&s;inuation again&s;t the Speaker, as to make it a part of thy &s;peech to us, before we had &s;een, or heard, the charge, we can do no le&s;s than re&s;ent it, as an <HI>indignity</HI> offered to this Hou&s;e; for, though we are men, that cannot be much meaner in the Governor's eye, than we are in our own e&s;teem, yet we mu&s;t put him in mind, that, &s;ince the royal charter commits this part of the legi&s;lative authority to our care, we ought to have the regard, due to our &s;tations."</P>

<P>The increa&s;e of this oppo&s;ition &s;eems principal|ly to have ari&s;en from the Proprietary's ab&s;ence, his not &s;eeing with his own eyes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Party in|crea&s;ed by the Propri|etor's ab|&s;ence, &amp;c.</NOTE> and tru&s;ting his affairs too much to deputies; to which the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of his &s;ituation and circum&s;tances, in the&s;e times, particularly obliged him; as fully appears by many of his private letters, during the latter part of his life, largely expre&s;&s;ing his ardent and longing de&s;ire to live and die in this country; con&s;equently &s;ome things, in his province, were not in that order, which could have been de&s;ired, though far from being as they were repre&s;ented; which, in &s;uch a new, young and unexperienced

government, in a colony compo&s;ed of &s;uch an heterogeneous mixture of people of different hu|mours, opinions and intere&s;ts, and in a land of &s;o great liberty, as this then was, &s;o much the more required the pre&s;ence of an able and con&s;tant hand, to manage and redre&s;s; though, in the whole, compared with others, it was manife&s;tly in a very happy, thriving and flouri&s;hing condition.</P>
<P>From hence, however, his adver&s;aries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And endan|gers the go|vernment and con&s;ti|tution, &amp;c.</NOTE> and the di&s;contented party, took occa&s;ion to magnify what was ami&s;s; and, as it is an ea&s;y matter to per&s;uade people that they are aggrieved, more e&s;pecially when under &s;uch a variety of difficulties as is common and natural, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree, to any new &s;ettlement of this kind, they, therefore, influenced many of the <HI>well-meaning</HI> to join in the oppo&s;ition; which was now carried on with a high hand; though, it is, with great rea&s;on, ap|prehended, divers of the&s;e neither de&s;igned, nor &s;aw, the con&s;equence, to which their proceedings naturally and ultimately tended; which, at length, about this time, produced the following &s;evere and expo&s;tulatory letter from the Proprietary to the A&s;&s;embly, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>It is a mournful con&s;ideration, and the cau&s;e of deep affliction to me, that I am forced,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro|prietor's letter to the A&s;&s;embly in 1710.</NOTE> by the oppre&s;&s;ions and di&s;appointments, which have fal|len to my &s;hare in this life, to &s;peak to the people of that province, in a language, I once hoped, I &s;hould never have occa&s;ion to u&s;e. But the many troubles and oppo&s;itions, that I have met with from thence, oblige me, in plainne&s;s and free|dom, to expo&s;tulate with you, concerning the cau&s;es of them.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="034421_0046_0FFD9E9D12067C98"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1710.</NOTE>When it plea&s;ed God to open a way for me to &s;ettle that colony, I had rea&s;on to expect a &s;o|lid comfort from the &s;ervices, done to many hun|dreds of people; and it was no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to me, that I have not been di&s;appointed in &s;eeing them pro&s;per, and growing up to a flouri&s;hing country, ble&s;&s;ed with liberty, ea&s;e and plenty, beyond what many of them&s;elves could expect; and wanting nothing to make them&s;elves happy, but what, with a right temper of mind, and pru|dent conduct, they might give them&s;elves. But, alas! as to my part, in&s;tead of reaping the like advantages, &s;ome of the greate&s;t of my troubles have aro&s;e from thence; the many combats, I have engaged in; the great pains, and incredi|ble expen&s;e, for your welfare and ea&s;e, to the de|cay of my former e&s;tate; of which (however &s;ome there would repre&s;ent it) I too &s;en&s;ibly feel the effects; with the unde&s;erved oppo&s;ition, I have met with from thence, &s;ink me into &s;orrow; that, if not &s;upported by a &s;uperior hand, might have overwhelmed me long ago. And I cannot but think it hard mea&s;ure, that, while that has proved a land of freedom and flouri&s;hing, it &s;hould become to me, by who&s;e means it was principally made a country, the cau&s;e of grief, trouble and poverty.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on I mu&s;t de&s;ire you all, even, of all profe&s;&s;ions and degrees, for although all have not been engaged in the mea&s;ures, that have been taken, yet every man, who has an intere&s;t there, is, or mu&s;t be, concerned in them, by their effects; I mu&s;t, therefore, I &s;ay, de&s;ire you all, in a &s;erious and true weightine&s;s of mind, to con&s;ider what you are, or have been, doing; why matters mu&s;t be carried on with the&s;e divi&s;ions and contentions, and what real cau&s;es have been given, on my &s;ide, for that oppo&s;ition to me, and my intere&s;t, which I have met with; as if I were
<PB N="47" REF="034421_0047_0FFD9E9F81DF4B38">
an enemy, and not a friend, after all I have done and &s;pent, both here and there: I am &s;ure, I know not of any cau&s;e what&s;oever. Were I &s;en|&s;ible you really wanted any thing of me, in the relation between us, that would make you hap|pier, I &s;hould readily grant it, if any rea&s;onable man would &s;ay it were fit for you to demand; provided you would al&s;o take &s;uch mea&s;ures as were fit for me to join with.</P>
<P>Before any one family had tran&s;ported them|&s;elves thither, I earne&s;tly endeavoured to form &s;uch a model of government, as might make all, concerned in it, ea&s;y; which, neverthele&s;s, was &s;ubject to be altered, as there &s;hould be occa&s;ion. Soon after we got over, that model appeared, in &s;ome parts of it, to be very inconvenient, if not impracticable; the numbers of members, both in the Council and A&s;&s;embly, were much too large; &s;ome other matters al&s;o proved incon&s;i&s;tent with the King's charter to me; &s;o that, according to the power re&s;erved for an alteration, there was a nece&s;&s;ity to make one, in which, if the lower counties were brought in, it was well known, at that time, to be on a view of advantage to the province it&s;elf, as well as to the people of tho&s;e counties, and to the general &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e concerned, without the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of any irregularity in the method.</P>
<P>Upon this they had another charter pa&s;&s;ed, <HI>nemine contradicente;</HI> which I always de&s;ired might be continued, while you your&s;elves would keep up to it, and put it in practice; and many there know much it was again&s;t my will, that, upon my la&s;t going over, it was vacated. But after this was laid a&s;ide (which indeed was begun by your&s;elves, in Colonel <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s time) I, accord|ing to my engagement, left another, with all the privileges, that were found convenient for your
<PB N="48" REF="034421_0048_0FFD9EA60100CA48">
good government; and, if any part of it has been, in any ca&s;e, infringed, it was never by my approbation. I de&s;ired it might be enjoyed fully. But though privileges ought to be tenderly pre|&s;erved, they &s;hould not, on the other hand, be a&s;&s;erted, under that name, to a licentiou&s;ne&s;s: the de&s;ign of government is to pre&s;erve good or|der; which may be equally broke in upon by the turbulent endeavours of the people, as well as the over&s;training of power, in a Governor. I de|&s;igned the people &s;hould be &s;ecured of an annual fixed election and A&s;&s;embly; and that they &s;hould have the &s;ame privileges in it, that any other A&s;|&s;embly has, in the Queen's dominions; among all which this is one con&s;tant rule, as in the par|liament here, that they &s;hould &s;it on their own adjournments; but to &s;train this expre&s;&s;ion to a power, to meet, at all times during the year, without the Governor's concurrence, would be to di&s;tort government, to break the due propor|tion of the parts of it, to e&s;tabli&s;h confu&s;ion in the place of nece&s;&s;ary order, and make the legi&s;lative the executive part of government. Yet, for ob|taining this power, I perceive, much time and money has been &s;pent, and great &s;truggles have been made, not only for this, but &s;ome other things, that cannot, at all, be for the advantage of the people to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; particularly the appointing of Judges; becau&s;e the admini&s;tration might, by &s;uch means, be &s;o clogged, that it would be difficult, if po&s;&s;ible, under our cir|cum&s;tances, at &s;ome times, to &s;upport it. As for my own part, as I de&s;ire nothing more than the tranquillity and pro&s;perity of the province and government, in all its branches, could I &s;ee that any of the&s;e things, that have been contended for, would certainly promote the&s;e ends, it would be a matter of indifference to me how they were &s;ettled. But &s;eeing the frame of every government ought
<PB N="49" REF="034421_0049_0FFD9E2BC68D0080">
to be regular in it&s;elf, well proportioned and &s;ub|ordinate, in its parts, and every branch of it in|ve&s;ted with &s;ufficient power to di&s;charge its re&s;pec|tive duty, for the &s;upport of the whole, I have cau&s;e to believe that nothing could be more de|&s;tructive to it, than to take &s;o much of the pro|vi&s;ion, and executive part of the government out of the Governor's hands, and lodge it in an un|certain collective body; and more e&s;pecially &s;ince our government is dependent, and I am an&s;werable to the crown, if the admini&s;tration &s;hould fail, and a &s;top be put to the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice. On the&s;e con&s;iderations I cannot think it prudent, in the people, to crave the&s;e powers; becau&s;e not only I, but they them&s;elves, would be in danger of &s;uffering by it; could I believe otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould not be again&s;t granting any thing of this kind, that were a&s;ked of me, with any degree of common prudence and civility. But, in&s;tead of finding cau&s;e to believe, the contentions, that have been rai&s;ed about the&s;e matters, have pro|ceeded only from mi&s;takes of judgment, with an earne&s;t de&s;ire, notwith&s;tanding, at the bottom, to &s;erve the public (which, I hope, has &s;till been the inducement of &s;everal concerned in them) I have had but too &s;orrowful a view and &s;ight to complain of the manner, in which I have been treated. The attacks on my reputation, the ma|ny indignities put upon me, in papers &s;ent over hither, into the hands of tho&s;e who could not be expected to make the mo&s;t di&s;creet and charitable u&s;e of them; the &s;ecret in&s;inuations again&s;t <HI>my ju&s;tice,</HI> be&s;ides the attempt, made upon my e&s;tate; re&s;olves pa&s;t in the A&s;&s;emblies, for turning my <HI>quit-rents,</HI> never &s;old by me, to the &s;upport of government; my lands entered upon, without any regular method; my manors invaded, (under pre|tence I had not duly &s;urveyed them) and both the&s;e by per&s;ons principally concerned in the&s;e attempts

again&s;t me here; a right to my overplus land, unju&s;tly claimed by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the tracts, in which they are found; my private e&s;tate con|tinually exhau&s;ting, for the &s;upport of that go|vernment, both here and there; and no provi&s;ion made for it by that country; to all which I cannot but add, the violence, that has been particularly &s;hewn to my Secretary; of which (though I &s;hall, by no means, protect him in any thing, he can be ju&s;tly charged with, but &s;uffer him to &s;tand or fall by his own actions) I cannot but thus far take notice, that, from all the&s;e charges, I have &s;een, or heard of, again&s;t him, I have cau&s;e to believe, that had he been as much in oppo&s;ition to me, as he has been under&s;tood to &s;tand for me, he might have met with a milder treatment from his pro&s;e|cutors; and, to think that any man &s;hould be the more expo&s;ed there, on my account, and, in&s;tead of finding favour, meet with enmity, for his be|ing engaged in my &s;ervice, is a melancholy con|&s;ideration! In &s;hort, when I reflect on all the&s;e heads, of which I have &s;o much cau&s;e to complain, and, at the &s;ame time, think of the hard&s;hips I, and my &s;uffering family, have been reduced to, in no &s;mall mea&s;ure, owing to my endeavours for, and di&s;appointments from, that province, I can|not but mourn the unhappine&s;s of my portion, dealt to me from tho&s;e, of whom I had rea&s;on to expect much better and different things; nor can I but lament the unhappine&s;s, that too many of them are bringing on them&s;elves, who, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing the amicable ways of peace, love and unity, which, at fir&s;t, hoped to find in that re|tirement, are cheri&s;hing a &s;pirit of contention and oppo&s;ition; and, blind to their own intere&s;t, are over&s;etting that foundation, on which your hap|pine&s;s might be built.</P>
<P>Friends, the eyes of many are upon you; the people of many notions of <HI>Europe</HI> look on that

country, as a land of ea&s;e and quiet, wi&s;hing to them&s;elves, in vain, the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ings, they con|ceive you may enjoy: but, to &s;ee the u&s;e you make of them, is no le&s;s the cau&s;e of &s;urpri&s;e to others, while &s;uch bitter complaints and reflections are &s;een to come from you, of which it is difficult to con|ceive, even, the &s;en&s;e or meaning.

<P>Is it &s;uch a <HI>grievous oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> that the <HI>courts</HI> are e&s;tabli&s;hed by my power, founded on the king's charter, without a law of your making, when upon the &s;ame plan you propo&s;e? If this di&s;turb any, take the advice of other able lawyers on the main, without tying me up to the opinion of prin|cipally one man, whom I cannot think &s;o very proper to direct in my affairs (for, I believe, the late A&s;&s;embly have had but that one lawyer among&s;t them) and I am freely content you &s;hould have any law, that, by proper judges, &s;hould be found &s;uitable. Is it your <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> that the <HI>officers fees</HI> are not &s;ettled by an act of A&s;&s;embly? No man can be a greater enemy to extortion, than my&s;elf: do, therefore, allow &s;uch fees as may rea&s;onably encourage fit per&s;ons to undertake the&s;e offices, and you &s;hall &s;oon have (and &s;hould have always cheerfully had) mine, and, I hope, my Lieute|nant's concurrence and approbation. Is it &s;uch an <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> that licences for public hou&s;es have not been &s;ettled, as has been propo&s;ed? It is a certain &s;ign you are &s;trangers to <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> and know nothing but the name, when you &s;o highly be&s;tow it on matters &s;o incon&s;iderable; but that bu&s;ine&s;s, I find, is adju&s;ted.

<PB N="52" REF="034421_0052_0FFD9EC500199AB0">
mea&s;ures to remedy, if you truly feel any &s;uch) I would be as ready, on my part, to remove them, as you to de&s;ire it; but according to the be&s;t judgment, I can make of the complaints, I have &s;een (and you once thought I had a pretty good one) I mu&s;t, in a deep &s;en&s;e of &s;orrow, &s;ay, that I fear, the kind hand of Providence, that has &s;o long favoured and protected you, will, by the ingratitude of many there to the great mercies of God, hitherto &s;hewn them, be, at length, pro|voked to convince them of their unworthine&s;s; and, by changing the ble&s;&s;ings, that &s;o little care has been taken, by the public, to de&s;erve, into calamities, and reduce tho&s;e, that have been &s;o clamorous, and cau&s;ele&s;sly di&s;contented, to a true, but &s;marting &s;en&s;e of their duty. I write not this, with a de&s;ign to include all; I doubt not, many of you have been burdened at, and can, by no means, join in the mea&s;ures that have been taken; but while &s;uch things appear under the name of an A&s;&s;embly, that ought to repre&s;ent the whole, I cannot but &s;peak more generally than I would de|&s;ire, though I am not un&s;en&s;ible what methods may be u&s;ed to obtain the weight of &s;uch a name.</P>
<P>I have already been tedious, and &s;hall now, therefore, briefly &s;ay, that the oppo&s;ition, I have met with from thence mu&s;t, at length, force me to con&s;ider more clo&s;ely of my own private and &s;inking circum&s;tances, in relation to that province. In the mean time, I de&s;ire you all &s;eriou&s;ly to weigh what I have wrote, together with your duty to your&s;elves, to me, and to the world, who have their eyes upon you, and are witne&s;&s;es of my early and earne&s;t care for you. I mu&s;t think there is a regard due to me, that has not of late been paid; pray, con&s;ider of it fully, and think &s;oberly, what you have to de&s;ire of me, on the one hand, and ought to perform to me, on the other; for, from
<PB N="53" REF="034421_0053_0FFD9ECAFA1648F8">
the next A&s;&s;embly, I &s;hall expect to know what you re&s;olve, and what I may depend on.

<P>What reply was made to this letter does not ap|pear; but notwith&s;tanding what might have been thought deficient, or ami&s;s, on the Proprietary's &s;ide, the &s;erious nature of it could not but affect the con&s;iderate part of the A&s;&s;embly with more regard for the father of their country, now, in his declining age, and for his difficult &s;ituation, occa&s;ioned originally and principally on account of it, or, for the real advantage of the colony, than they had, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, exhibited; &s;eeing it plainly hinted to what their proceedings nece&s;&s;arily tended, and the means, though not expre&s;&s;ed, which he &s;hould &s;oon be obliged to u&s;e, without an immediate alteration of the A&s;&s;embly's conduct, relative to him and his intere&s;t.

<P>The congre&s;s of Governors, or council of war, met accordingly at <HI>New London,</HI> in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> where the &s;everal quotas, or proportions, expected from each colony, were fixed; but by rea&s;on of the &s;hort &s;pace of time, and great di&s;tance, Go|vernor <HI>Gookin</HI> could not attend it, nor properly repre&s;ent the &s;tate and ability of the province; and the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> thought the colony over-rated:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Indi|ans a con|&s;tant ex|pen&s;e to Penn&s;ylva|nia, &amp;c.</NOTE> for this province particularly was con|&s;tantly at a con&s;iderable expen&s;e, for the pre&s;er|vation of the friend&s;hip of the Indians, in &s;uch manner, as was very important and intere&s;ting to all the neighbouring governments, and the gene|ral utility; they neverthele&s;s voted <HI>two thou&s;and pounds,</HI> to be rai&s;ed upon the inhabitants of the province, for the Queen's u&s;e, by a tax of five pence half penny per pound, on e&s;tates, and twenty &s;hillings per head, on &s;ingle freemen: and a bill for that purpo&s;e was pa&s;&s;ed by the Governor.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="034421_0057_0FFD9E09C8BF6CF8">In the A&s;&s;embly, elected October, 1711, there was a con&s;iderable change of Members; and <HI>Da|vid Lloyd</HI>'s name again appears among them; but <HI>Richard Hill</HI> was cho&s;en Speaker.</P>
<P>The Governor, in a &s;peech to the Hou&s;e, this winter, expre&s;&s;ed, That the Proprietary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro|prietor de|&s;ires to &s;erve the people of the pro|vince, &amp;c.</NOTE> in his let|ters to him, had &s;ignified his de&s;ire to &s;erve the people of this province, and left it to them&s;elves, to think on the means, that might be&s;t conduce to their own quiet and intere&s;t: at the &s;ame time, offering his ready concurrence to any thing of that nature, which they &s;hould propo&s;e, con&s;i&s;t|ent with the honour and intere&s;t of the crown, of the Proprietary, and of the public welfare; and recommending to their con&s;ideration, that, as to him&s;elf, he had been above three years engaged in the affairs of the province, and almo&s;t &s;o long in it; that what he had received from the public, ap|peared by the acts of the la&s;t A&s;&s;embly; which was far &s;hort of what the Proprietary gave him to expect from the people.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e, in an&s;wer, thankfully acknowledged the Proprietary's kind regard, and de&s;ires to &s;erve them, with the Governor's offered and ready con|currence to what &s;hould contribute to that end.

<P>Governor <HI>Gookin,</HI> in his &s;peech to the A&s;&s;em|bly, on the 15th of October, this year, of which <HI>I&s;aac Norris</HI> was Speaker, thus hinted the former of the&s;e affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Purport of the Govern|or's &s;peech to the A&s;|&s;embly.</NOTE> expre&s;&s;ing, That the Proprietary, in a letter to a Member of the Council, had &s;ignified his intentions of &s;urrendering the government, in a few months: in con&s;equence of which he had rea&s;on to believe, he &s;hould not be continued Go|vernor under the crown; he declared his readine&s;s to &s;erve them, during the &s;hort time he &s;hould probably be in the admini&s;tration; and he reque&s;t|ed them to take effectual mea&s;ures, to have ready, when called for, the &s;um granted by the late A&s;|&s;embly; that the debts incurred, on account of the <HI>Indian treaties,</HI> be immediately di&s;charged, and that the <HI>Indians,</HI> then in town, be well &s;atis|fied; who had propo&s;ed, in behalf of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h a free and open trade between them, in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> for the future.

<P>We were in hopes, that the opening of the courts of ju&s;tice might have been a means to put a &s;top to tho&s;e tumults, which frequently happen|ed in this city, &s;ince the beginning of our &s;e&s;&s;ion,

&s;o that our meeting now would have been to crown our labours with a general &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>But, to our great di&s;appointment, we un|der&s;tand, by credible information, that &s;ome of tho&s;e who occa&s;ioned tho&s;e tumults, in order to annoy their oppo&s;ite party, are now levelling their malignity again&s;t the Magi&s;trates of this city and county, and endeavouring to prevail with the Governor to be of opinion, that here is no power to bring to trial a certain clergyman, who is charged by indictment, at the King's &s;uit, for committing <HI>fornication,</HI> again&s;t the King's peace, and the law of this province, &amp;c.</P>

<P>The chiefs of the <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Schuylkill Indians,</HI> in a vi&s;it to the Governor, &amp;c met in the court hou&s;e, at <HI>Philadelphia; Sa&s;&s;oonan</HI> being their head, and <HI>Ope&s;&s;ah,</HI> the late <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> king, with his companions attending him; and then opening the <HI>Calamet,</HI> with great ceremony of their rattles and &s;ongs, it was offered by <HI>Sa&s;&s;oonan,</HI> the king, to the Go|vernor and Council, and to all others of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there met; and af|terwards it was al&s;o offered by him to all his <HI>Indians;</HI> and then with the &s;ame ceremony was put up again.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Sa&s;&s;oonan</HI> ro&s;e, and &s;poke to the Governor, and &s;aid, "That the <HI>Calumet,</HI> the bond of peace, which they had carried to all the nations round, they had now brought hither; that it was a &s;ure bond and &s;eal of peace among&s;t them, and between them and us; and they de&s;ired, by holding up their hands, that the <HI>God of heaven</HI> might be witne&s;s to it, and that there might be a firm peace between them and us for ever."</P>
<P>To which the Governor an&s;wered;</P>
<P>That he was very glad to &s;ee them retain &s;o &s;trong a &s;en&s;e of that firm peace, which was &s;ettled between <HI>William Penn,</HI> the Founder and Chief Governor of this country, at his fir&s;t coming into it, in behalf of him&s;elf, and all his people, with them and all theirs; that they were &s;en&s;ible we had always pre&s;erved it unviolated, on our &s;ide; and were glad we had rea&s;on to &s;ay, they had done the &s;ame, on theirs; that we d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ired nothing more, than that the great <HI>God,</HI> who made heaven and earth, and all living creatures, and who knew the thoughts, and &s;aw all the actions of men, to whom they applied, &s;hould be witne&s;s of what
  
  <!-- PB 65 -->
  <PB N="65" REF="034421_0065_0FFD9E3F8721E1C8">

  now pa&s;&s;ed between us; and, that this renewal of the &s;ame bond of peace might be recorded between them and us, for ever.</P>
<P>With which &s;peech they expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves greatly &s;atisfied.</P>
<P><HI>Sa&s;&s;oonan</HI> added, that hearing of &s;ome murmurs among &s;ome of them&s;elves, to prevent any mi&s;under&s;tanding, they came to renew the former bond of friend&s;hip:&mdash;That <HI>William Penn</HI> had, at his fir&s;t coming, made a clear and open road, all the way to the <HI>Indians;</HI> [by this meaning a friendly communication] that they de&s;ired the &s;ame might be kept open; and that all ob&s;tructions &s;hould be removed; of which, on their &s;ide, they will take care.</P>
<P>He then pre&s;ented a belt of <HI>Wampum,</HI> and added to the &s;ame effect:</P>
<P>That they de&s;ired the peace, which had been made, &s;hould be &s;o firm; that they and we &s;hould join hand in hand &s;o firmly, that nothing, even the <HI>greate&s;t tree,</HI> &s;hould be able to divide them a&s;under.</P>
<P>After this, they, &s;eeming to wait for an an&s;wer, were de&s;ired to pro|ceed, and to deliver what they now had further to &s;ay; and that an&s;wers and returns, for binding the friend&s;hip, on our &s;ide, would be made to them altogether.</P>
<P><HI>Sa&s;&s;oonan</HI> accordingly proceeded and &s;aid, That their late king <HI>Skalit|chi</HI> de&s;ired of them that they would take care to keep a perfect with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and that they &s;hould be joined as one; that the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould be half <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> make them&s;elves as half <HI>Indians,</HI> that they might the better be as the &s;ame.</P>
<P>He further added, laying down a &s;econd belt, That, as the fathers have been in peace, &s;o they de&s;ired that their children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d our children &s;till, as they &s;hould be born, and come into the world <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, might be brought up in the &s;ame union; and that it &s;hould be continued between their and our po&s;terity, from generation to generation for ever.</P><!-- PB 66 -->
<PB N="66" REF="034421_0066_0FFD9E4F41D4EAF8">
<P>He added, That, in the la&s;t council, which they held with us, they &s;poke concerning the &s;un; by who&s;e influence they had lived in warmth and plenty, from the beginning; that they now de&s;ired the &s;ame happi|ne&s;s might be continued to them with us, in the firme&s;t peace; and that it might la&s;t as long as the &s;un &s;hould endure: that when any clouds in|terpo&s;e between them and the &s;un, it brings coolne&s;s, and is unplea&s;ant; the &s;ame will be, if any cloud &s;hould ari&s;e between them and us; and, therefore, they de&s;ire, if any thing of that kind appear, it may be di&s;&s;i|pated, without delay.</P>
<P>He laid down a third belt, and continued in the &s;ame &s;train, de&s;iring as before, that they might &s;till enjoy the warmth of the &s;un, and our friend|&s;hip together; that then they &s;hould want no nece&s;&s;aries of life, but en|joying all the comforts of it, with their wives, and might repo&s;e them|&s;elves with them in peace and &s;afety, without any di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>This he delivered in behalf of all our <HI>Indians,</HI> on this &s;ide <HI>Su&s;que|hanna,</HI> who are all concerned with him in this treaty; and this was all he had to &s;ay on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>He then began again, and laying down a bundle of deer &s;kins, &s;aid, That now they would di&s;cour&s;e of matters of trade between them and us; that hitherto it had been like a hou&s;e with two doors, one for them, the other for the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> but the goods were placed in the dark; &s;o that they were wholly ignorant how they had been dealt with, or how they &s;hould trade.</P>
<P>He repeated the &s;ame, laying down a &s;econd bundle of &s;kins, and de|&s;ired they might be informed of the terms, they might trade upon, that if occa&s;ion were, they might, at any time, &s;end their wives, and be out of danger of being cheated.</P>
<P>He added a third bundle of deer &s;kins, complaining how hard it was upon them; for that they knew not what they were to expect for their goods, and that they could &s;carce purcha&s;e ours.</P>
<P>Laying down a fourth bundle, being &s;kins and furs, he de&s;ired, that we might be as people, eating all of the &s;ame di&s;h, and &s;o they might be dealt with, as if they were our own people.</P>
<P>Pre&s;enting a fifth bundle, he &s;aid, that formerly they exactly knew the prices both of our goods and theirs; but now they varied &s;o much, there was no under&s;tanding them.</P><!-- PB 67 -->
<PB N="67" REF="034421_0067_0FFD9E3419BAD290">
<P>With a &s;ixth bundle, he &s;aid, That through this uncertainty, he wore him&s;elf &s;uch ragged breeches, that he was a&s;hamed to &s;hew them, and de&s;ired this inconveniency might be remedied.</P>
<P>Offering a &s;eventh, he complained that they were often impo&s;ed on by the weight of our money, when they came to &s;ell, that we certainly knew the value of theirs; but they could not under&s;tand ours; and, therefore, de&s;ired that this great inconveniency might al&s;o be remedied.</P>
<P>He offered an eighth, informing, that <HI>Ope&s;&s;ah</HI> (formerly king of the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> but now abdicated) lived at a great di&s;tance, and entertained them with victuals and provi&s;ions, when they went that way; and there|fore they de&s;ired, that when he &s;hould come among us, he might be re|ceived as one of them&s;elves, with the &s;ame openne&s;s, that he received from them.</P>
<P>Having ended their di&s;cour&s;e, they were told, that to-morrow they &s;hould receive an&s;wers to all they had &s;aid; and were, for the pre&s;ent, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Orders were given to the Mayor of <HI>Philadelphia, I&s;aac Norris,</HI> and the Secretary, to take an account of the pre&s;ents, now made, and their value; and that goods &s;hould be provided, to be ready in the morning; and the &s;aid pre&s;ents were found to con&s;i&s;t of,</P>

<P>Pre&s;ents having been prepared, according to order, and the <HI>Indians</HI> being met and &s;eated, the Governor ordered the interpreter to inform them, "That their vi&s;it, on &s;o friendly a de&s;ign, as &s;till further to &s;trength|en the bond of Peace between us, was very acceptable; that we doubted not but they would think them&s;elves, and their children from generation to generation, obliged to keep inviolable tho&s;e firm treaties of peace, which had been made, and which we had kept, and were re&s;olved ever to keep firm, on our &s;ide; and hope none of them have any cau&s;e to murmur: if they knew of any, they are de&s;ired to mention it freely.</P>
<P>That the great <HI>Queen of England,</HI> who had, for &s;o many years, reigned with great &s;ucce&s;s, was now dead, and was &s;ucceeded by a King, who has been a great General, in the wars, is a wi&s;e King, and has more dominions, than any King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> ever had before him; that under him, as well they (the <HI>Indians</HI>) as we, his other &s;ubjects, may live in the &s;ame peace, that we have enjoyed any time before; that our Proprietary, their Friend, <HI>William Penn,</HI> is &s;till living, though but weak in health.</P>
<P>That, as to the complaints, they made concerning trade, the Go|vernor is &s;orry he cannot give them a more entire &s;atisfaction in it, and  <!-- PB 69 -->
<PB N="69" REF="034421_0069_0FFD9E51A9191670">

remove every hard&s;hip, which they lie under; but that all trade is un|certain; our own wheat the la&s;t year, yielded twice the price, it does this; all our goods, which they buy, are brought from <HI>England,</HI> whi|ther we al&s;o &s;end theirs; that &s;ometimes a habit, which is in fa&s;hion one year, is laid a&s;ide the next; and accordingly the &s;kins, of which they are made, will be of a higher or lower value. It is the &s;ame with all our other merchandize, as with tho&s;e which they buy; their only &s;ecurity and &s;afety will be, to trade with the hone&s;te&s;t men, and tho&s;e of the be&s;t reputation, and prefer tho&s;e who will give the mo&s;t; that this is our rule, in all our bu&s;ine&s;s, and they mu&s;t do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>That <HI>Ope&s;&s;ah</HI> has long been under a league of friend&s;hip with us; and though he has now left tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> among whom he formerly lived, yet we &s;hall &s;hew him the &s;ame friend&s;hip as ever; and &s;hall depend upon the &s;ame from him; and that, upon this further recommendation from them, he will think him&s;elf as one of them, and under the &s;ame bond with them; and, therefore, we de&s;ire, that, as he lives at a great di&s;|tance, and may &s;ee many foreign <HI>Indians,</HI> he will, from time to time, inform us, if he hears of any thing, which may concern us; and this we de&s;ire, and &s;hall expect and depend on from him, and all his friends there; as al&s;o that, if they know any thing now of any late motions to or from the &s;outhward, they would acquaint us.</P>
<P>Concerning which, being particularly a&s;ked, <HI>Ope&s;&s;ah</HI> affirmed, he knew nothing.</P>
<P>The Governor further ordered, they &s;hould be told, That all the &s;ober <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> very much lamented that they could not guard them&s;elves better again&s;t liquor; that they &s;hould &s;end their young men abroad to hunt, and, at their return, &s;hould &s;ell their goods for &s;uch things as would be of real &s;ervice to them, and not throw it all away for that de|&s;tructive liquor <HI>rum;</HI> which robbed them, not only of their goods, but of their lives al&s;o</P>
<P>All which being delivered together with the pre&s;ents, which were provided, <HI>Pokehais,</HI> in the name of the re&s;t, expre&s;&s;ed their &s;atisfaction and thanks, for the &s;avours now &s;hewed them."</P>

<P>Such has been the King's goodne&s;s, not only expre&s;&s;ed in his fir&s;t generous royal declaration, and repeatedly &s;ince, from the throne, but more powerfully exerted through a mo&s;t wi&s;e and &s;tea|dy admini&s;tration, in pur&s;uing every mea&s;ure, that might contribute to the &s;afety and happine&s;s of his people; in making the known laws the invaria|ble rule of his government; in re&s;toring the ho|nour of the <HI>Briti&s;h nation</HI> abroad; and in procur|ing for his &s;ubjects &s;uch advantages, in commerce, as could &s;carce be hoped for, after they had been &s;o unhappily given away, that, even, the remote&s;t parts of the King's great dominions feel the be|nign influences of his paternal affection to the whole, and are laid under doubled obligations to make the utmo&s;t returns of gratitude, as well as obedience, for their happine&s;s, under his au&s;picious reign.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e the Governor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When our Proprietary and Governor in Chief, fir&s;t obtained a grant of this province from the crown, and a numerous colony of indu&s;trious people &s;ettled therein, we are well a&s;&s;ured it was his inclination, as well as vi&s;ible intere&s;t, to ren|der them as &s;afe as po&s;&s;ible, under his admini&s;tra|tion.</P>
<P>And, as his religious per&s;ua&s;ion, as a di&s;&s;en|ter from the e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> was well known, and therefore tho&s;e of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion made a great part of the fir&s;t adventurers with him, it cannot be doubted but that he would ever think him&s;elf obliged to provide that they &s;hould enjoy, in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> at lea&s;t, equal ea&s;e and privileges with any other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ubjects of the &s;ame rank, in any of the King's dominions.</P>
<P>Accordingly when nece&s;&s;itated to be ab&s;ent from us, as he has, for the mo&s;t part been, he took care, from time to time, to appoint &s;uch per&s;ons, to be his deputies, in the government, in who&s;e moderation and tenderne&s;s towards his friends, as well as loyalty to the crown, and ju&s;|tice to all its &s;ubjects, he believed he might confide.</P>
<P>When the Governor, therefore, fir&s;t brought over the Proprietary's commi&s;&s;ion of deputation, for the government, we could not doubt but that, being the Proprietary's choice, and acting &s;olely by powers, derived from him, he would &s;teadily pur&s;ue the mea&s;ures, that had generally been ta|ken, from our fir&s;t &s;ettlement, and endeavour to make all the &s;ubjects of the crown, under the Proprietary's government, equally &s;ecure and ea&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="034421_0075_0FFD9E375140C750">On this expectation, confirmed by the Pro|prietary's letters of recommendation, the A&s;&s;em|blies, not doubting the Governor's good intentions towards them, freely di&s;charged what was incum|bent on them, and it is hoped, in no &s;mall mea|&s;ure, to the Governor's &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Nor while the Proprietary's health, and for|mer abilities happily continued, had the inhabitants much rea&s;on to complain, but that the Governor made the Proprietary's directions, from home, as far as they could be obtained, and the advice of tho&s;e, the Proprietary had in&s;tructed here, the rule (in great mea&s;ure) of his conduct, in what related to the Proprietary's intere&s;t, or govern|ment, and to the privileges of the people.</P>
<P>But whether it be now owing to the di&s;con|tinuance of tho&s;e orders and directions, which has followed on the late great and melancholy change, in the Proprietary's health, or to &s;ome unhappy advice from others, or to any new formed views, we know not; but this Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives, &s;oon after their fir&s;t meeting, finding the Governor had, at length, &s;o far lo&s;t &s;ight of the obligations he lay under to his principal and con|&s;tituent, as to enter on mea&s;ures incon&s;i&s;tent with his intere&s;t, and our con&s;titution, and the liberties of the people, we judged it our indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to apply to the Governor for redre&s;s; who declaring his opinion to be &s;uch as would not admit of any, we de&s;ired, with due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that he would be plea&s;ed to &s;uffer the rea&s;ons of that opinion to be argued before him; but finding, to our trou|ble, that all our endeavours were in vain, we think our&s;elves obliged, in the di&s;charge of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in us, fully to repre&s;ent the fatal con&s;equences, as well as the unrea&s;onablene&s;s, of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, to the end that a proper relief may be obtained; without which the greater part
<PB N="76" REF="034421_0076_0FFD9EAFABDF7200">
of the inhabitants of this province mu&s;t be ren|dered mi&s;erable; which we humbly offer, as fol|lows:</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who accompanied the Proprietary in the &s;ettlement of this colony, being chiefly (as has already been ob&s;erved) of tho&s;e called <HI>Qua|kers,</HI> who, lying under &s;ome hard&s;hips, in their native country, becau&s;e, for con&s;cience-&s;ake, they could not comply with the laws there, for taking oaths, expected that, by virtue of the powers of legi&s;lation, granted by the crown, to the Proprie|tary and them, they might, after the hazard and toil of their removal hither, be capable of enjoy|ing the privileges of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, without violation of their religious principles.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Proprietary and A&s;&s;emblies provided laws, by which tho&s;e people might be enabled to hold any offices (there being but few others at that time, to fill them) or to give evi|dence in any ca&s;e what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Some di&s;putes afterwards ari&s;ing on this &s;ub|ject, the late Queen, by her order, in Council, dated the 21&s;t of January, 1702, was plea&s;ed to extend to this province, the <HI>affirmation</HI> allowed to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> by the &s;eventh and eighth of <HI>William</HI> the Third, not only for the pur|po&s;es intended by that in <HI>England,</HI> but al&s;o for the qualification of Magi&s;trates and officers; and the &s;ame being from thence applied to other ca&s;es, this order, on the repeal of our own acts, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;upplied what was nece&s;&s;ary, in this point, for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But the act of parliament it&s;elf being near its expiration, it was found nece&s;&s;ary, as well on that, as &s;ome other con&s;iderations, to e&s;tabli&s;h, by an act of the province, the qualifications of officers, and the manner of giving evidence, by affirmation; and the Governor (upon the A&s;&s;em|bly's
<PB N="77" REF="034421_0077_0FFD9E6F70983F20">
performing the conditions propo&s;ed them) pa&s;&s;ed acts for that, as well as other purpo&s;es, to an&s;wer the exigencies of the government.</P>
<P>That the &s;aid affirmation-acts &s;hould have full force, according to the intention of them, of &s;uch importance to the ea&s;e and &s;ecurity of the whole province, that it could &s;carcely be &s;uppo&s;|ed, any per&s;on among&s;t us, who profe&s;&s;ed, even, the mo&s;t &s;lender regard for the people's welfare, would attempt to deprive them of the advantages thereof.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, the more &s;urpri&s;ing, that the Governor him&s;elf (from who&s;e &s;tation, and the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, by our Proprietary, the mo&s;t tender concern for the &s;afety and well-being of all his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, under his care, might rea&s;onably be expected) &s;hould be the principal, if not the fir&s;t, per&s;on, in the government, who would render the intention of tho&s;e acts void to us, though pa&s;&s;ed by him&s;elf into laws &s;o lately before, by publicly declaring his opinions, in &s;uch manner, as would render the &s;aid acts repugnant to the laws of <HI>England,</HI> and repealed by the act of parliament of the fir&s;t of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty; in pur&s;uance of which opinion, he has refu&s;ed to qualify &s;uch per&s;ons for offices, that could not take the oath, according to the law of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The con&s;equence of which is, that, as no <HI>Quaker</HI> in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> is qualified, or permit|ted, to give evidence, in any criminal cau&s;es, or &s;erve on any juries, or bear any office, or place of profit, in the government; &s;o, &s;hould the &s;ame hold, in this colony, not only the great number of the fir&s;t adventurers, with their de&s;cendants, of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, are to be wholly excluded from having any part, or &s;hare, in the admini&s;tra|tion of ju&s;tice, and the execution of the laws of the country, (which, as it would be a general in|conveniency,
<PB N="78" REF="034421_0078_0FFD9E1A7531BCA0">
&s;o would it throw the burden too hea|vily on a few of the inhabitants) but, what is of no le&s;s importance, for the &s;ecurity of tho&s;e of other profe&s;&s;ions, the greate&s;t outrages and barbarities, again&s;t any per&s;on, may be committed, in the face of any number of <HI>Quakers,</HI> and the male|factors, though brought to trial, mu&s;t e&s;cape with impunity, for want of legal evidence, if that of the <HI>Quakers</HI> is not to be &s;o accounted; of which the Governor cannot forget a very memorable in|&s;tance, when (at a time, that unhappily there was no act of the province, for an <HI>affirmation,</HI> but the Queen's order was thought &s;ufficient, during that interval, for all but capital ca&s;es) it is pre&s;umed a murderer e&s;caped the &s;entence, that was due to him, for want of &s;uch evidence, as was e&s;teemed legal, though more than one <HI>Quaker</HI> appeared in court, who were witne&s;&s;es to the fact.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the&s;e inconveniencies, however great, there remains one further con&s;equence of that con&s;truction of the act, which, perhaps, the Governor is not &s;ufficiently advi&s;ed of; which is, That, if no <HI>Quaker,</HI> in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> nor the <HI>Plantations,</HI> can bear any office, or place of pro|fit, in the government, &s;ome may judge it a natu|ral inference, that the Proprietary him&s;elf is equally affected by it; and then all powers derived from him, as well tho&s;e lodged in the Governor, by his deputation, as the magi&s;tracy and inferior offi|cers, fall together.</P>
<P>Having thus far pointed out the de&s;tructive con&s;equences of that opinion, &s;hould it fully take place in this province, we judge it, in the next place, incumbent on us, in duty to the Governor, and for the di&s;charge of the tru&s;t, repo&s;ed in us, by tho&s;e we repre&s;ent, to offer to the con&s;ideration of the Governor, and all others concerned, &s;uch rea&s;ons as have occurred to us, in our enquiry into
<PB N="79" REF="034421_0079_0FFD9E71E7D864C8">
this head; which we hope (with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion) will render it inconte&s;tibly evident that the affirmation-acts of this province are in full force; and are neither repealed, nor affected by any act of parli|ament, that has come to our knowledge; but that the Governor is obliged to take care that the &s;ame be equally, with any other act, put duly in execu|tion.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame royal charter of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, by which this province, with licence to tran&s;port an ample colony thereunto, was granted to our Proprietary, and the Governor in Chief, the &s;aid King grants to him and his heirs, &amp;c. pow|er to make laws jointly with the people; and di|rects the force and limitation of them, in the fol|lowing words, as they &s;tand in divers parts of the &s;aid charter, but are here collected, <HI>viz,</HI></P>

<P>But the Governor, in an&s;wer to a re&s;olution of this Hou&s;e of the 18th of October la&s;t, which was, That the royal charter makes the acts of this province mo&s;t ab&s;olute and available in law, until repealed by the King, is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, That he joins with the A&s;&s;embly, in this re&s;olve, provided the laws are not repugnant to the laws of <HI>England;</HI> and by the following paragraph, in the &s;ame an|&s;wer, which is, That he allows the laws of the province had &s;ettled the qualifications of Magi&s;|trates and other officers, until the publication of the act of King <HI>George,</HI> relating thereto, he has,
<PB N="82" REF="034421_0082_0FFD9E3C7522E7C0">
at la&s;t, thought fit to give &s;o much under his hand, as his opinion, the natural con&s;truction whereof is, that the &s;aid affirmation-acts of this province (being the &s;ubject then in hand) were repugnant to the laws of <HI>England,</HI> and repealed by the &s;aid act of parliament.</P>
<P>But this we humbly offer, That, if it mu&s;t be termed repugnant, becau&s;e it differs from, or is not the &s;ame with, the act of parliament, then the clau&s;e of the royal charter, which grants pow|er to the Governor and A&s;&s;embly here to alter the laws of <HI>England,</HI> for the de&s;cent of lands, enjoy|ing e&s;tates, and puni&s;hing felonies, in the province (as is above recited from the &s;aid charter) appears to be u&s;ele&s;s and vain.</P>
<P>But it is further to be con&s;idered, That, as the term <HI>repugnant,</HI> always implies an ab&s;olute oppo&s;ition, or contrariety, in matter, it cannot be &s;aid that an act of this province, which ena|bles tho&s;e, called <HI>Quakers,</HI> to &s;erve in offices, upon juries, and to be evidence, in all ca&s;es (the circum&s;tances of the country requiring that it &s;hould be &s;o) is contrary to an act of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which enables them only to give evidence in civil ca&s;es; the&s;e two differ, it is true, and &s;o it was certainly con&s;idered and expected, at the time of the royal grant, that our acts might, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, differ from tho&s;e in <HI>England;</HI> otherwi&s;e tho&s;e in <HI>England</HI> would &s;uffice; and no &s;uch power for altering them needed to have been granted: on the contrary, the act of this province, pur&s;uant to the directions of that royal charter, is as nearly agreeable, as to our conveniency may be, to the &s;tatute provided for <HI>Quakers,</HI> in <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>But the Governor, we pre&s;ume, could not intend, by his an&s;wer, That this act, at the time of pa&s;&s;ing it, was repugnant to any of the laws of <HI>England,</HI> though it differed from them, for in
<PB N="83" REF="034421_0083_0FFD9E3DF7D42CE0">
that, certainly, he could not have given it his &s;anc|tion; it mu&s;t, therefore, be meant, that it is be|come <HI>repugnant</HI> only &s;ince the &s;uppo&s;ed publication of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> act, which he conceives repealed it; or, to &s;tate what can be alledged on that head, in its full force, and the plaine&s;t terms it will bear, that the act of the fir&s;t of king <HI>George,</HI> entitled, <HI>An act for making perpetual an act of the &s;eventh and eighth years of the reign of his late Maje&s;ty, King William the Third,</HI> entitled, An act, <HI>That the &s;o|lemn affirmation and declaration of the people called Quakers, &s;hould be accepted in&s;tead of an oath, in the u&s;ual form,</HI> &amp;c. extends to this province that act of King <HI>William,</HI> by the&s;e words in the la&s;t clau&s;e of it, viz. <HI>Provided always,</HI> That &s;o much of this act, as relates to the affirmations to be made by the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;hall be ex|tended to that part of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> called Scot|land, for ever, and to the plantations belonging to the crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> for five years, &amp;c. Therefore, that, as the <HI>Quakers</HI> are not permit|ted, by that act, in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to hold offices, &s;erve on juries, or be evidence in criminal ca&s;es, &s;o, by its being extended to the plantations, they are as effectually di&s;abled there, and that all acts of this province, for qualifying <HI>Quakers,</HI> in the&s;e ca&s;es, are, by the &s;uperior force of this act of parliament, repealed, and made utterly void.</P>
<P>But when the language of the act it&s;elf comes to be con&s;idered, the whole &s;eeming force of this objection will, we pre&s;ume, entirely di&s;ap|pear; the clau&s;e of limitation, in the &s;eventh and eighth of <HI>William</HI> the Third, is in the&s;e words: <HI>"Provided, and be it enacted, That no Quaker, or reputed Quaker, &s;hall, by virtue of this act, be qualified or permitted, to give evidence, in any cri|minal cau&s;es, to &s;erve on any juries, to bear any of|fice, or place of profit, in the government, any thing in this act contained to the contrary notwith&s;tanding."</HI>

Upon which we conceive that Brigadier <HI>Hunter,</HI> Governor, under his Maje&s;ty, of the provinces of <HI>New York</HI> and <HI>New Jer&s;ey,</HI> has (in a ca&s;e pa|rallel with ours) ob&s;erved, in his printed declarati|on on that &s;ubject, under the title of, "An an&s;wer to what has been offered, as argument again&s;t the validity and force of an act of A&s;&s;embly, entitled, <HI>An act, that the &s;olemn affirmation and declaration of the people called Quakers,</HI> &amp;c. pa&s;&s;ed in the pro|vince of <HI>New Jer&s;ey,</HI> in the thirteenth year of the reign of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> to be of &s;uch force, as to be worthy our recital: in which, after he has ob|&s;erved, in general, in the following words:&mdash; "Into what a woful condition mu&s;t the planta|tions be plunged, if &s;uch laws as &s;hall, by a Legi|&s;lature lawfully con&s;tituted by virtue of letters patent, under the broad &s;eal, be enacted for the good government and ea&s;e of the &s;ubjects there, &s;hall, by implication, or con&s;truction, be deemed to be repealed!" &amp;c. he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that act of A&s;&s;embly is not &s;o much as, by implication, repealed; for the words of that act, upon which they lay the &s;tre&s;s of the argument, are the&s;e, <HI>Provided, that no Quaker &s;hall, by virtue of this act, be qualified,</HI> &amp;c. Now I know no <HI>Quaker,</HI> continues that gentleman, that pretends he is, or can, by virtue of that act, be qualified; but I believe every <HI>Quaker</HI> thinks that he is, or may be, qualified by an act of A&s;&s;embly, entitled, An act, that the &s;olemn affirmation and declaration of the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> &amp;c. pa&s;&s;ed in the pro|vince, and &s;ent home, &amp;c. It is as plain as words can make it, that that act, of the &s;eventh and eighth of King <HI>William,</HI> has no negative, but upon it&s;elf, and con&s;equently cannot be alledged in bar to any laws already enacted, in the plantations, or even &s;uch as may be enacted; for, by the&s;e letters patent, which gave a being to this govern|ment and Legi&s;lature, all &s;uch laws, as &s;hall be

<P>The &s;ame worthy gentleman and Governor is further plea&s;ed, in the &s;aid print, to publi&s;h an in&s;truction from the late Queen, in who&s;e reign that act of A&s;&s;embly was made, directing him to pa&s;s &s;uch an act in <HI>New Jer&s;ey;</HI> by which in&s;truc|tion her Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed further to declare her will and plea&s;ure, "That &s;uch of the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> as &s;hall be found capable of &s;erv|ing in her Council, the General A&s;&s;embly, and in other places of tru&s;t and profit, in <HI>New Jer&s;ey,</HI> and accordingly be elected, or appointed, to &s;erve therein, may, upon their taking and &s;igning the declaration of allegiance to her Maje&s;ty, in the form, u&s;ed by the &s;ame people, in <HI>England,</HI> to|gether with a &s;olemn declaration of the true di&s;|charge of their re&s;pective tru&s;ts, be admitted by the Governor to any of the &s;aid places or employ|ments." And he adds, "That the &s;ame in&s;truc|tions are, word for word, al&s;o contained in his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions to the Governor, dated the fir&s;t of July, 1715.

<P>To this we may add what has al&s;o been ob|&s;erved, on the &s;ame &s;ubject, by the Chief Ju&s;tice of <HI>New Jer&s;ey,</HI> in his &s;peech, delivered at the &s;upreme court, in May la&s;t, at <HI>Burlington,</HI> which is al&s;o printed; wherein he clearly gives his opinion in law, very nearly in the &s;ame terms, the Governor
<PB N="86" REF="034421_0086_0FFD9E41F141CD60">
had done before, and then proceeds, in the&s;e words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The act of parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> is an enlargement of the <HI>Quakers</HI> privileges to what it never was before; it makes that perpetual to them, in <HI>England,</HI> which before was temporary and expired, or near expiring, by its own limita|tion, carries the &s;ame into that part of <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI> called <HI>Scotland,</HI> where it was not before, and makes it perpetual there, and into the plan|tations, generally, for five years. This does no way hinder, but that, by virtue of the act of A&s;|&s;embly of the province (which is a municipal law thereof) the <HI>Quakers,</HI> or reputed <HI>Quakers,</HI> are qualified to be of juries and evidence, and bear offices of tru&s;t and profit, in the government; nor, but that they may be &s;o qualified hereafter, by any other law, hereafter to be made, for that, or the like purpo&s;e, although by virtue of that act of parliament, they are not &s;o qualified.</P>
<P>Having thus far &s;tated this point, we &s;hall now leave it; but that we are obliged to give the &s;en&s;e of this Hou&s;e to that part of the Governor's an&s;wer to our re&s;olves, in which he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, That though he was of opinion he could not be &s;afe in giving any qualification but an oath, yet by a <HI>dedimus</HI> they, (the officers and witne&s;&s;es) might have been qualified, as the law directs.</P>
<P>On which we mu&s;t humbly ob&s;erve, That though it may be very certain a <HI>dedimus pote&s;tatem,</HI> duly i&s;&s;ued by the Governor, is no le&s;s &s;ufficient, in law, for admini&s;tering qualifications to any officer, than the Governor's act, in his own per|&s;on; which, notwith&s;tanding, the Governor has not of late, that we know of, conde&s;cended to, but refu&s;ed to admit &s;uch of tho&s;e called <HI>Quakers,</HI> as, by virtue of the Proprietary's charter to the people, were elected to &s;erve in certain offices,
<PB N="87" REF="034421_0087_0FFD9E63695344F8">
until that more remarkable ca&s;e of the la&s;t quali|fication of the Mayor of <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> yet no &s;uch <HI>dedimus</HI> will an&s;wer the exigencies of this government, &s;hould the Governor's opinion ob|tain: for &s;hould it be taken for granted, that the affirmation-act of this province is actually repealed by the act of parliament, then all &s;uch qualifica|tions will be con&s;trued illegal, whether given by him&s;elf, or other per&s;ons, empowered by him. And as the Judges of the &s;upreme court have ren|dered their rea&s;ons to the Hou&s;e, for their not proceeding to try the criminals, now in the re&s;pec|tive gaols of this province, viz. <HI>That they cannot think it prudent to proceed, by virtue of the Govern|or's commi&s;&s;ion to them, in oppo&s;ition to his opinion, in &s;o tender a point, as the lives of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ub|jects:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The names of the&s;e Judges were, William Trent, Jonathan Dick|in&s;on and George Roach.</NOTE> &s;o all others mu&s;t be di&s;couraged in ca&s;es of &s;uch va&s;t con&s;equence; for no <HI>dedimus</HI> will make that act &s;ufficient, that is in it&s;elf illegal.</P>
<P>It has, by this time, we hope, clearly ap|peared, from what has been offered, That the opinion of the Governor is (with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion) nei|ther founded on law nor rea&s;on; but from hence we cannot but de&s;ire the Governor may be in|duced more &s;eriou&s;ly and maturely to con&s;ider how unaccountable and a&s;toni&s;hing it mu&s;t appear to mankind, that, while &s;uch per&s;ons as Governor <HI>Hunter,</HI> who holds his commi&s;&s;ion directly from the crown, is accountable to no other principal, nor under obligations to any called a <HI>Quaker,</HI> as a &s;uperior, has thought it nece&s;&s;ary, in the di&s;charge of his tru&s;t, to publi&s;h his rea&s;ons, in &s;uch a man|ner, for removing mi&s;takes, and allaying the di&s;turbances from thence fomented; at the &s;ame time, though &s;uch an example be &s;et to us, at no greater di&s;tance, than the other bank of <HI>Delaware,</HI> our <HI>Proprietary, William Penn</HI>'s Lieutenant, in the
<PB N="88" REF="034421_0088_0FFD9E1DD044AC40">
province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> &s;hould be drawn into mea&s;ures &s;o injurious, not only to the intere&s;t of his principal, from which he derives his power, but to the very being of the con&s;titution, over which he is entru&s;ted to pre&s;ide. We heartily wi&s;h we could, by any con&s;truction, find other cau&s;es, to which the&s;e procedures might be im|puted, than a formed de&s;ign; but we are ju&s;tly alarmed at &s;ome other late proceedings of the Go|vernor, which, as they have naturally fallen under our notice, we think our&s;elves al&s;o obliged, in du|ty, to repre&s;ent:</P>
<P>When the Hou&s;e had cho&s;en their Speaker, and the Governor, without any objection, ap|proved their choice, they proceeded to take the u&s;ual qualifications as the law, in that ca&s;e, directs; but upon the rumours, that had been &s;pread, of per&s;ons di&s;affected to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, that this Hou&s;e might give the utmo&s;t expre&s;&s;ions, they could, of their loyalty, they, by a me&s;&s;age to the Governor, reque&s;ted to know, if be&s;ides what they had taken as u&s;ual, the Governor had any directions from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> or any other qua|lification to offer to the Hou&s;e; to which, he was plea&s;ed to an&s;wer, <HI>he had not:</HI> the Hou&s;e notwith|&s;tanding re&s;olved to neglect no part of their duty, but to give all the a&s;&s;urances of their loyalty, in their power, thought fit unanimou&s;ly to take and &s;ub&s;cribe the te&s;t, called the <HI>abjuration,</HI> every one, in the way pre&s;cribed to them by the &s;everal acts of parliament, according to their religious per&s;ua|&s;ions, and then proceeded to the bu&s;ine&s;s before them.</P>
<P>But being informed that the Governor had, at divers times, and to &s;undry per&s;ons, charged the pre&s;ent Mayor of the city of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> now Speaker of the Hou&s;e, as a per&s;on di&s;affected to his Maje&s;ty, King <HI>George;</HI> and that he further
<PB N="89" REF="034421_0089_0FFD9E67A88FF4F8">
alledged, the only cau&s;e of difference betwixt him and the &s;aid Mayor, was, becau&s;e the Governor would not agree to proclaim the Pretender, or words to the &s;ame effect; the Hou&s;e conceived them&s;elves obliged, in duty to his &s;aid Maje&s;ty, to enquire into the grounds of this heinous charge, that, in ca&s;e there &s;hould be any found&punc; they might purge them&s;elves of the &s;candal.</P>
<P>Accordingly, having, in a committee of the whole Hou&s;e, taken full proofs, that the Govern|or had &s;o charged the Speaker, and finding, by the &s;ame evidence, that he had, in the &s;ame man|ner, al&s;o charged <HI>James Logan,</HI> Secretary of the province, they, by a me&s;&s;age, de&s;ired of the Go|vernor, that he would be plea&s;ed to lay before the Hou&s;e his grounds for the&s;e accu&s;ations; but he returned no other an&s;wer, than, "That he thought him&s;elf not obliged to render any rea&s;ons to the Hou&s;e for his accu&s;ation, but would do it at the board at home;" and the Members, &s;ent on the me&s;&s;age, could not per&s;uade him to give any rea|&s;ons here.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e thereupon judged it &s;till the more incumbent on them to enquire fully into the mat|ter; and accordingly they, by a written me&s;&s;age, in|formed the Governor, That, being under a deep concern, on all occa&s;ions, to &s;hew their loyalty, as faithful &s;ubjects, to King <HI>George,</HI> they could, by no means, think them&s;elves di&s;charged of their duty, without further enquiring into the truth of the report, which they had received, and acquaint|ed the Governor with, which affected their Speak|er and another per&s;on, bearing con&s;iderable offices and tru&s;ts, in the government; and finding the Governor's an&s;wer to the la&s;t me&s;&s;age, concerning the &s;ame, not &s;atisfactory, they further acquainted him, that the Hou&s;e intended immediately to re|&s;olve into a committee, in order to enquire into
<PB N="90" REF="034421_0090_0FFD9EABB54CCA68">
that matter, and that the &s;aid committee would be de&s;irous to receive from the Governor, or any other per&s;on, any information concerning the &s;ame, in order to proceed to the extent of what is their duty, and purge the Hou&s;e of any Mem|ber, or Members thereof, that may appear, or &s;hall be found guilty of di&s;loyalty to the King, or di&s;affection to his government, under which the Hou&s;e unanimou&s;ly declared them&s;elves extremely happy, and well &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>But the Governor, though another me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to him, to crave his an&s;wer, could not be prevailed on to give any, but that he had no|thing to lay before them; the Hou&s;e notwith|&s;tanding, while formed into a committee for that purpo&s;e, proceeded to make the utmo&s;t enquiries, in their power; but could not find the lea&s;t ground to &s;u&s;pect the per&s;ons charged, or to believe the accu&s;ations, again&s;t them, had any manner of foundation.</P>
<P>Now what &s;entiments can be formed of &s;uch a conduct, in a per&s;on, acting in &s;o exalted a &s;ta|tion, the Hou&s;e mu&s;t acknowledge them&s;elves to be at a lo&s;s to determine! But the Hou&s;e would con&s;ider it, as no &s;mall happine&s;s to the whole province, could they be a&s;&s;ured that the Govern|or had no de&s;ign, by his repre&s;entations to any board, at home, to rai&s;e a merit to him&s;elf, on the ruin of others; who, could they be heard there, and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lly known, might be found as faith|ful and loyal, in their &s;tations, to the pre&s;ent e&s;ta|bli&s;hment and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as any of the King's &s;ubjects what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Had the Governor believed the Speaker to be &s;uch a per&s;on, as he has thought fit to render him, it was doubtle&s;s incumbent on the Govern|or to except again&s;t him, when fir&s;t pre&s;ented by the Hou&s;e, in that &s;tation, or had he &s;u&s;pected either
<PB N="91" REF="034421_0091_0FFD9E98D80060F0">
the Speaker, or any other Member, to be di&s;af|fected to the King, it might be no le&s;s expected, that he &s;hould have recommended to the Hou&s;e, the further qualification of the <HI>abjuration,</HI> as a te&s;t to them: but, if the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and others acting in the great tru&s;ts, are to be rendered to the mini&s;try, or to any board, as per&s;ons &s;o no|toriou&s;ly di&s;affectd, as the Governor's charges im|ply, and this without the lea&s;t proof offered here, though &s;o importunately, and yet dutifully &s;olicit|ed, it will force all thinking per&s;ons on apprehen|&s;ions, that there is more intended by it, than can &s;afely be acknowledged here, where things and per&s;ons are better known, than can po&s;&s;ibly be at &s;uch a di&s;tance, as the other &s;ide of the ocean.</P>
<P>Having proceeded to &s;uch a length, on the&s;e two important &s;ubjects, we &s;hould now chu&s;e to bring this <HI>repre&s;entation</HI> to a period, but that the Governor's written an&s;wer to another me&s;&s;age from the Hou&s;e exacts our notice; in which he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, That he is given to under&s;tand, (for which he thinks fit to quote the language of former A&s;&s;emblies, and &s;ome of the Council) that this Hou&s;e did not de&s;ign to make laws, nor rai&s;e any money this &s;e&s;&s;ion, but upon terms incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the Governor's duty and &s;afety to comply with. To which the ju&s;te&s;t reply we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> pre&s;ent, return, is, That this Hou&s;e came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ther with no other views, than to di&s;charge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> duty, in all re&s;pects, to the be&s;t of their &s;kill a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> power; and they have nothing to crave of the Governor, but what they firmly believe is not only his duty, but for his honour and &s;afety, to grant them: they would willingly have proceed|ed to enquire what further laws may be nece&s;&s;ary for the well-being of the province, in general, the Governor having told us, in his &s;peech, That, if
<PB N="92" REF="034421_0092_0FFD9E92B1B21390">
we &s;hould have any other bills to offer, that might be for the intere&s;t and tranquillity of the people, he &s;hould be ready to pa&s;s them, and promi&s;ed him&s;elf, that he would make a return &s;uitable to their circum&s;tances, and the advantages they will receive by them: but, in his next written me&s;|&s;age, he informed the Hou&s;e, "That he di&s;a|greed from both the Council and A&s;&s;embly, in his opinion, upon a point of &s;uch importance to the &s;ecurity, as well as tranquillity of the people, that no bill of ours can be of more to us:" the pur|port of which was, that he declared (in oppo&s;ition to both Council and A&s;&s;embly) that one of the la&s;t laws, he him&s;elf had pa&s;&s;ed, which mo&s;t near|ly affected us, was void, and this by con&s;truction only; we could not, therefore, find any encou|ragement from the Governor's propo&s;als to us, to think any other bill, we could offer, was worth the &s;oliciting, and much le&s;s de&s;erving, a further con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>To this we mu&s;t not omit adding, That we find judgment was given again&s;t one <HI>Hugh Lowdon,</HI> at the court of common pleas, in September la&s;t, whereupon the &s;aid <HI>Hugh Lowdon,</HI> giving way to the greate&s;t re&s;entment and rage, vowed revenge, at the utmo&s;t hazards, again&s;t the afore&s;aid Speak|er and Secretary (being two of the Ju&s;tices of that court) and having furni&s;hed him&s;elf with pi&s;tols, way-laid them, at their doors, and meeting the Speaker, the &s;ame night, he pre&s;ented at him a pi&s;tol loaden with bullets; although, by the over|ruling hand of Providence, no further mi&s;chief en&s;ued. As this attempt could not but rai&s;e a horror in the hearts of all good men, we find the &s;aid <HI>Lowdon</HI> was bound over to the court, now &s;it|ting, and indictments were &s;ound again&s;t him, for the &s;ame; at which the Governor, in&s;tead of pro|tecting the Magi&s;trates, in the di&s;charge of their

Which pro|ceedings, as they rendered the admini&s;tration con|temptible, &s;o we al&s;o ju&s;tly fear they will encou|rage ill-minded men to the &s;ame attempts, in hopes of the like favour.</P>
<P>But, to &s;um up the whole, we can truly &s;ay, we are extremely troubled, that we cannot enjoy the &s;ame happine&s;s, that mo&s;t of our neighbours re&s;pectively do, of &s;eeing our Governor take &s;uch mea&s;ures, as &s;hould, by an agreeable force, &s;way the people's inclinations, to render him ea&s;y, in all re&s;pects; which can be effected by no means &s;o powerfully, as fir&s;t rendering them ea&s;y, in the enjoyment of tho&s;e privileges, which they have an undoubted right to: and we are but too well a&s;|&s;ured, that the only cau&s;e of a failure herein, is the Governor's mi&s;take, &s;ince the Proprietary's indi&s;po&s;ition, in the choice of his advi&s;ers; who, whatever views they may, at pre&s;ent form, will, at length, be found the &s;ole occa&s;ion of all the di&s;appointments, that may fall to the Governor's portion; for, even, though acting by commi&s;&s;ion, immediately from the crown, he would have the &s;ame injured people to deal with.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the A&s;&s;embly,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Being informed, upon my arrival here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor Keith's fir&s;t &s;peech to the A&s;&s;em|bly.</NOTE> that the &s;ea&s;on of harve&s;t, then at hand, could not well permit you to meet me, in your repre&s;entative capacity, until that bu&s;y time be over; I did, out of a tender regard for your intere&s;ts, then delay the &s;atisfaction I &s;till propo&s;ed to my&s;elf, in meet|ing with this pre&s;ent A&s;&s;embly; and I will always endeavour to make the time, you mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be&s;tow on the public &s;ervice, as ea&s;y and plea&s;ant to your&s;elves as, I hope, it will be profitable and &s;atisfactory to the country in general.</P>
<P>If an affectionate de&s;ire, to oblige and &s;erve the people of this province, can qualify me, in their good opinions, for the &s;tation wherein I am now placed, I may then expect that the country's and the Governor's intere&s;t will be effectually e&s;ta|bli&s;hed upon one bottom, as that he, who truly wi&s;hes well to either, cannot but find him&s;elf en|gaged to &s;erve both; and you your&s;elves may ea&s;ily infer the warmth of my inclinations towards the &s;ervice and pro&s;perity of this country.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, From the expen&s;ive application, la&s;t year, by which I carefully introduced to his royal highne&s;s, the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> then Regent, the humble addre&s;s of the A&s;&s;embly to the King, in
<PB N="96" REF="034421_0096_0FFEA87D5B46B250">
&s;uch manner, as freely to obtain his royal high|ne&s;s's mo&s;t gracious a&s;&s;urance, that the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> were a body of loyal &s;ubjects, for whom the King had great regard; and that his highne&s;s was &s;orry the King was not then pre&s;ent to receive &s;o good an addre&s;s; but that the <HI>Qua|kers</HI> might, at all times, depend on his highne&s;s's good-will, to &s;erve them, in any thing, they had to a&s;k of his royal father.</P>
<P>Then, the diligence, wherewith I obtained, at a con&s;iderable charge, the commi&s;&s;ion of Go|vernor, without any other certain pro&s;pect, or advantage, but only that I &s;hould be thereby enabled more effectually to &s;erve you.</P>
<P>And, la&s;tly, by the great fatigue I have un|dergone, &s;ince my arrival here, that no opportu|nity might be &s;lipped, to encourage virtue, and promote the general good of your country; but the&s;e con&s;iderations are trifles, compared with the indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation, that is of nece&s;&s;ity upon you, to &s;upport the dignity and authority of this government, by &s;uch a rea&s;onable and di&s;creet e&s;tabli&s;hment, as the nature of the thing, and your own genero&s;ity will direct.</P>
<P>And what&s;oever you &s;hall think &s;it to do, in that kind, pray let it no longer bear the unde&s;erved and reproachful name of a burden upon the peo|ple; but rather let your Governor be enabled to relieve the country from real burdens, by putting it in his power to direct a better oeconomy, and more frugal management of &s;uch taxes, as would an&s;wer the u&s;es, for which they are intended, if not &s;quandered by the bare-faced partiality and un|profitable expen&s;e of the officers appointed to a&s;&s;e&s;s and collect the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I doubt not, but you will take the fir&s;t opportunity, under a new admini&s;tration, to examine the &s;tate of your laws, in order to

<P>For that end, I am, on my part, ready to concur with you, in every thing, which you can po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire, or expect, from a Governor, who con&s;cientiou&s;ly intends to ob&s;erve, and &s;teadily re&s;olves to pur&s;ue the duty of his office.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e the Governor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We gladly embrace this fir&s;t opportunity to congratulate the Governor's happy and &s;afe arri|val to us, with an eye to that good Providence, which pre&s;erved him and his family from pirates; who, at that time, much infe&s;ted our coa&s;t; &s;ome of whom (as we are informed) waited with hopes of his falling into their hands.</P>
<P>This Hou&s;e, maturely con&s;idering the Go|vernor's &s;peech, find them&s;elves obliged, in duty, to make grateful acknowledgments, for the Go|vernor's tender regards to the intere&s;t of the pub|lic.</P>
<P>The Governor's affectionate de&s;ire, to oblige and &s;erve the people of this province, doth, and &s;hall, meet with dutiful returns, in all matters, that come before us; and this Hou&s;e will contri|bute all, in their power, to pre&s;erve the intere&s;t of the Governor and people upon one bottom.</P>

Prince, then Regent, the humble addre&s;s of the A&s;&s;embly of this province, &s;o we gladly take this occa&s;ion to confe&s;s the warmth of our hearts, in loyalty, duty and affection to the King, and roy|al family, and entreat the Governor, upon all oc|ca&s;ions, &s;o to repre&s;ent us.</P>
<P>We cannot but expre&s;s the plea&s;ure, and great &s;atisfaction of this Hou&s;e, in that the Pro|prietary hath been plea&s;ed to place, and his Ma|je&s;ty to approve of, &s;o worthy a gentleman, in commi&s;&s;ion over us; and hope our behaviour, and that of all the people of this province, will always be &s;uch as may pre&s;erve the good inclinations of the Governor to &s;erve the country; an in&s;tance whereof we have in the fatiguing journeys he hath taken, in the late hot &s;ea&s;on, to promote the good of tho&s;e under his government.</P>
<P>As the Governor was plea&s;ed to defer calling us, for the &s;ake of harve&s;t, &s;o we crave leave to ob&s;erve to him, that &s;eed time being ju&s;t at hand, it will be a great inconveniency to many of the Members to &s;tay long at this &s;ea&s;on, &s;o that we do not undertake, at this &s;itting, to enter upon an examination of our laws, or any bu&s;ine&s;s that will require length of time, but, depend upon the Governor's re&s;olves and good intentions to oblige the people, by concurring with any thing, they can rea&s;onably de&s;ire, for their &s;ervice.</P>
<P>We, on our part, being fully &s;atisfied, in our duty of &s;upporting, as far as in us lies, the dignity and authority of this government, have at this time voted, <HI>nemine contradicente,</HI> that the &s;um of <HI>five hundred pounds</HI> &s;hall be given to the Go|vernor, and paid out of the fir&s;t public money, that &s;hall ari&s;e, by any means, in the trea&s;ury; and to make it more certain, are now preparing a bill, which will be offered to the Governor, for augmenting the public &s;tock.</P>

<P>The Governor well knows that the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration of this government, &s;ince the Pro|prietary's decea&s;e, is &s;upported by a law, confirmed by her late Maje&s;ty, Queen <HI>Anne;</HI> and by virtue thereof, is to continue till further order from the King, or the heirs of the &s;aid late Proprietary and Governor; and notwith&s;tanding the great regard, the Governor has to the commi&s;&s;ion, &s;ent him by the &s;aid Proprietary's heir at law, yet &s;ince that heir &s;eems not, by the afore&s;aid <HI>will,</HI> inve&s;ted with the powers of government; but the devi&s;e thereof, made to the &s;aid <HI>Lords,</HI> being allowed by his own council to be good; and &s;ince it doth not appear that commi&s;&s;ion is attended with the nece&s;&s;ary re|qui&s;ites, directed by acts of parliament, for quali|fications of per&s;ons concerned in &s;uch &s;tations, and &s;ecurity of plantation-trade, we conceive it will contribute to the peace of this government, and be &s;afe for the Governor, that he, for the pre&s;ent, forbear to publi&s;h the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ion; and hope there will be no ju&s;t occa&s;ion given, if the Go|vernor &s;hould wave &s;uper&s;eding the powers given him by the &s;aid heir at law, until he receive the plea&s;ure of the &s;aid tru&s;tees, or has the Lord Chan|cellor's decree, for his direction; the rather, be|cau&s;e we under&s;tand that an amicable &s;uit is depend|ing in <HI>chancery</HI> betwixt the executrix, and heir at law, in order to &s;ettle both their claims to this go|vernment.

<P><HI>"My Brothers and Children,</HI></P>
<P>"So &s;oon as you &s;ent me word, that your near friends and relations, the Chiefs of the <HI>Five Na|tions,</HI> were come to vi&s;it you, I made ha&s;te, and am come to &s;ee both you and them, and to a&s;&s;ure all the <HI>Indians</HI> of the continuance of my love to them.</P>
<P>"Your old acquaintance and true friend, the great <HI>William Penn,</HI> was a wi&s;e man; and, there|fore, he did not approve of wars, among the <HI>In|dians,</HI> whom he loved; becau&s;e it wa&s;ted and de|&s;troyed their people; but always recommended peace to the <HI>Indians,</HI> as the &s;ure&s;t way to make them rich and &s;trong, by increa&s;ing their numbers.</P>
<P>"Some of you can very well remember &s;ince <HI>William Penn,</HI> and his friends, came fir&s;t to &s;ettle among you, in this country: it is but a few years, and like as ye&s;terday, to an old man; neverthele&s;s, by following that great man's peaceable coun&s;els, this government is now become wealthy and pow|erful, in great numbers of people. And though many of our inhabitants are not accu&s;tomed to war, and di&s;like the practice of men killing one another; yet you cannot but know, I am able to bring &s;eve|ral thou&s;ands into the field, well armed, to defend both your people and ours, from being hurt by any enemy, that dur&s;t attempt to invade us.</P>
<P>"However, we do not forget that <HI>William Penn</HI> often told us, that the experience of old age, which is true wi&s;dom, advi&s;es peace; and I &s;ay to
<PB N="131" REF="034421_0131_0FFD9F231CD45730">
you, that the wi&s;e&s;t man is al&s;o the brave&s;t man: for he &s;afely depends on his wi&s;dom; and there is no true courage without it.</P>
<P>"I have &s;o great a love for you, my dear bro|thers, who live under the protection of this go|vernment, that I cannot &s;uffer you to be hurt, no more than I would my own children. I am but ju&s;t now returned from <HI>Virginia;</HI> where I wearied my&s;elf, in a long journey, both by land and water, only to make peace for you, my children, that you may &s;afely hunt in the woods, without danger, from <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the many <HI>Indian Nations,</HI> that are at peace with that government. But the Go|vernor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> expects, that you will not hunt within the great mountains, on the other &s;ide of <HI>Potowmack</HI> river; being a &s;mall tract of land, which he keeps for the <HI>Virginia Indians,</HI> to hunt in: and he promi&s;es that his <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hall not come any more on this &s;ide <HI>Potowmack,</HI> or behind the great mountains this way, to di&s;turb your hunting. And this is the condition I have made for you; which I expect you will firmly keep, and not break it on any con&s;ideration what&s;oever.</P>
<P>"I de&s;ire that what I have now &s;aid to you may be interpreted to the Chiefs of the Five Nations pre&s;ent: for as you are a part of them, they are, in like manner, one with us, as you your&s;elves are; and, therefore, our coun&s;els mu&s;t agree, and be made known to one another: for our hearts &s;hould be open, that we may perfectly &s;ee into one another's brea&s;ts. And that your friends may &s;peak to me freely, tell them I am willing to for|get the mi&s;takes, which &s;ome of their young men were guilty of, among&s;t our people. I hope they will grow wi&s;er with age, and hearken to the grave coun&s;els of their old men; who&s;e valour we e&s;teem, becau&s;e they are wi&s;e; but the ra&s;hne&s;s of their young men is altogether folly."</P>

<P><HI>"My Friends and Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>"It is a great &s;atisfaction to me, that I have this opportunity of &s;peaking to the valiant and wi&s;e <HI>Five Nations</HI> of <HI>Indians,</HI> whom you tell me, you are fully empowered to repre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="034421_0136_0FFEA855EDDCBCE8">"I treat you, therefore, as if all the&s;e nations were here pre&s;ent; and you are to under&s;tand, what I now &s;ay, to be agreeable to the mind of our great Monarch, <HI>George,</HI> the King of <HI>England,</HI> who bends his care to e&s;tabli&s;h peace among&s;t all the mighty nations of <HI>Europe;</HI> unto whom all the people, in the&s;e parts, are, as it were, but like one drop, out of a bucket, &s;o that what is now tran&s;acted between us, mu&s;t be laid up, as the words of the whole body of your people and our people, to be kept in perpetual remembrance.</P>
<P>"I am al&s;o glad to find that you remember what <HI>William Penn</HI> formerly &s;aid to you. He was a great and a good man: his own people loved him; he loved the <HI>Indians,</HI> and they al&s;o loved him. He was as their father; he would never &s;uffer them to be wronged; neither would he let his people enter upon any lands, until he had fir&s;t purcha&s;ed them of the <HI>Indians.</HI> He was ju&s;t, and therefore the Indians loved him.</P>
<P>"Though he is now removed from us; yet his children and people, following his example, will always take the &s;ame mea&s;ures; &s;o that his and our po&s;terity will be as a long chain, of which he was the fir&s;t link; and when one link ends, another &s;ucceeds, and then another; being all firmly bound together in one &s;trong chain, to en|dure for ever.</P>
<P>"He formerly knit the chain of friend&s;hip with you, as the chief of all the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the&s;e parts; and le&s;t this chain &s;hould grow ru&s;ty, you now de&s;ire it may be &s;coured, and made &s;trong, to bind us, as one people, together. We do a&s;&s;ure you, it is, and has always been, bright on our &s;ide; and &s;o we will ever keep it.</P>
<P>"As to your complaint of our traders, that they have treated &s;ome of your young men un|kindly, I take that to be &s;aid only by way of ex|cu&s;e
<PB N="137" REF="034421_0137_0FFD9F02AB7B2250">
for the follies of your people, thereby en|deavouring to per&s;uade me, that they were pro|voked to do what you very well know they did; but, as I told our own <HI>Indians,</HI> two days ago, I am willing to pa&s;s by all the&s;e things; you may therefore be a&s;&s;ured, that our people &s;hall not of|fer any injury to yours; or, if I know that they do, they &s;hall be &s;everely puni&s;hed for it. So you mu&s;t, in like manner, &s;trictly command your young men, that they do not offer any injury to ours. For when they pa&s;s through the utmo&s;t &s;kirts of our inhabitants, where there are no people yet &s;ettled, but a few traders, they &s;hould be more careful of them, as having &s;eparated them&s;elves from the body of their friends, purely to &s;erve the <HI>Indians</HI> more commodiou&s;ly with what they want.</P>
<P>"Neverthele&s;s, if any little di&s;orders &s;hould, at any time, hereafter ari&s;e, we will endeavour that it &s;hall not break, or weaken, the chain of friend&s;hip between us: to which end, if any of your people take offence, you mu&s;t, in that ca&s;e, apply to me, or to our chiefs. And when we have any cau&s;e to complain, we &s;hall, as you de|&s;ire, apply to your chiefs, by our friends, the <HI>Cone&s;togoe Indians:</HI> but, on both &s;ides, we mu&s;t labour to prevent every thing of this kind, as much as we can.</P>
<P>"You complain, that our traders come into the path of your young men, going out to war, and thereby occa&s;ion di&s;orders among them; I will, therefore, my friends and brothers, &s;peak very plainly to you, on this head.</P>
<P>"Your young men come dawn <HI>Su&s;quehanna</HI> river, and take their road through our <HI>Indian</HI> towns and &s;ettlements, and make a path between us and the people, again&s;t whom they go out to war. Now, you mu&s;t know, that the path, this
<PB N="138" REF="034421_0138_0FFEA8D9E363C4C8">
way, leads them only to the <HI>Indians,</HI> who are in alliance with the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and fir&s;t, to tho&s;e, who are in a &s;trict league of friend&s;hip with the Go|vernor of <HI>Virginia;</HI> ju&s;t as the&s;e, our friends and children, who are &s;ettled among us, are in league with me and our people.</P>
<P>"You cannot therefore make war upon the <HI>Indians,</HI> in league with <HI>Virginia,</HI> without weaken|ing the chain with the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> for, as we would not &s;uffer the&s;e, our friends and brothers of <HI>Co|ne&s;togoe,</HI> and upon the river, to be hurt by any per&s;ons, without con&s;idering it, as done to our|&s;elves; &s;o the Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI> looks upon the injuries, done to his Indian brothers and friends, as if they were done to him&s;elf. And you very well know, that, though you are five different nations, yet you are but one people; &s;o as that any wrong, done to one nation, is receiv|ed as an injury, done you all.</P>
<P>"In the &s;ame manner, and much more &s;o, it is with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who are all united under one great King, who has more people, in that one town, where he lives, than all the <HI>Indians,</HI> in <HI>North America,</HI> put together.</P>
<P>"You are in league with <HI>New York,</HI> as your ancient friends, and neare&s;t neighbours; and you are in league with us, by treaties, often repeated, and by a chain, which you have now brightened. As, therefore, all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are but one people, you are actually in league with all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> go|vernments, and mu&s;t equally pre&s;erve the peace with all, as with one government.</P>
<P>"You plea&s;ed me very much, when you told me, that you were going to treat with the Go|vernor of <HI>Virginia.</HI> Your nations formerly entered into a very firm league with that government; and, if you have &s;uffered that chain to grow ru&s;ty, it is
<PB N="139" REF="034421_0139_0FFD9F1F95D7F310">
time to &s;cour it; and the Five Nations have done very wi&s;ely to &s;end you there for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>"I do a&s;&s;ure you, the Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI> is a great and a good man; he loves the <HI>Indians,</HI> as his children, and &s;o protects and defends them; for he is very &s;trong, having many thou&s;and Chri&s;tian warriors under his command; whereby he is able to a&s;&s;i&s;t all tho&s;e, who are in any league of friend&s;hip with him. Ha&s;ten, therefore, my friends, to brighten and &s;trengthen the chain with that great man; for he de&s;ires it, and will receive you kindly. He is my great and good friend; I have been lately with him; and &s;ince you &s;ay, you are &s;trangers, I will give you a letter to him, to inform him of what we have done, and of the good de&s;ign of your vi&s;it to him, and this country.</P>
<P>"My friends and brothers, I told you two days ago, that we mu&s;t open our brea&s;ts to each other; I &s;hall, therefore, like your true friend, open mine yet further to you, for your good.</P>
<P>"You &s;ee that the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> from a very &s;mall people, at fir&s;t, in the&s;e parts, are, by peace among&s;t them&s;elves, become a very great people among&s;t you, far exceeding the number of all the <HI>Indians,</HI> we know of.</P>
<P>"But while we are at peace, the <HI>Indians</HI> con|tinue to make war upon one another; and de&s;troy each other, as if they intended that none of their people &s;hould be left alive; by which means you are, from a great people, become a very &s;mall people; and yet you will go on to de&s;troy your|&s;elves.</P>
<P>"The <HI>Indians</HI> of the &s;outh, though they &s;peak a different language, yet they are the &s;ame people, and inhabit the &s;ame land, with tho&s;e of the north. We, therefore, cannot but wonder, how you, that are a wi&s;e people, &s;hould take delight in put|ting
<PB N="140" REF="034421_0140_0FFEA882260AC500">
an end to your race: the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> being your true friends, labour to prevent this. We would have you &s;trong, as a part of our&s;elves: for, as our &s;trength is your &s;trength, &s;o we would have yours to be as our own.</P>
<P>"I have per&s;uaded all my brethren, in the&s;e parts, to con&s;ider what is for their good; and not to go out any more to war; but your young men, as they come this way, endeavour to force them. And becau&s;e they incline to follow the coun&s;els of peace, and the good advice of their true friends, your people u&s;e them ill, and often prevail with them to go out, to their own de&s;truction. Thus it was, that their town of <HI>Cone&s;togoe</HI> lo&s;t their good King, not long ago; and thus many have been lo&s;t. Their young children are left without pa|rents; their wives without hu&s;bands; the old men, contrary to the cour&s;e of nature, mourn the death of their young; the people decay, and grow weak; we lo&s;e our dear friends, and are afflicted. And this is chiefly owing to your young men.</P>
<P>"Surely, you cannot propo&s;e to get either riches, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, by going thus out to war: for when you kill a deer, you have the fle&s;h to eat, and the &s;kin to &s;ell; but when you return from war, you bring nothing home, but the &s;calp of a dead man; who, perhaps, was hu&s;band to a kind wife, and father to tender children, who never wronged you; though, by lo&s;ing him, you have robbed them of their help and protection; and, at the &s;ame time, got nothing by it.</P>
<P>"If I were not your friend, I would not take the trouble of &s;aying all the&s;e things to you; which I de&s;ire may be fully related to all your people, when you return home, that they may con&s;ider in time, what is for their own good. And, after this, if any will be &s;o madly deaf and blind, as neither to hear nor &s;ee the danger before them, but will
<PB N="141" REF="034421_0141_0FFD9EF8B8F52D40">
go out to de&s;troy, and be de&s;troyed, for nothing, I mu&s;t de&s;ire that &s;uch fooli&s;h young men would take another path, and not pa&s;s this way, among&s;t our people, who&s;e eyes I have opened; and they have wi&s;ely hearkened to my advice. So that I mu&s;t tell you plainly, as I am their be&s;t friend, and this government is their protector, and as a father to them, we will not &s;uffer them any more to go out, as they have done, to their de&s;truction. I &s;ay again, we will not &s;uffer it; for we have the coun&s;el of wi&s;dom among&s;t us, and know what is for their good. For though they are weak, yet they are our brethren; we will therefore take care of them, that they be not mi&s;led with ill coun&s;el. You mourn when you lo&s;e a brother; we mourn, when any of them are lo&s;t; to prevent which they &s;hall not be &s;uffered to go out, as they have done, to be de&s;troyed by war.</P>
<P>"My good friends and brothers, I give you the &s;ame coun&s;el, and earne&s;tly de&s;ire that you will follow it, &s;ince it will make you a happy people. I give you this advice, becau&s;e I am your true friend; but I much fear you hearken to others, who never were, and never will be, your friends.</P>
<P>"You know very well, that the <HI>French</HI> have been your enemies, from the beginning; and though they made peace with you twenty-two years ago, yet, by &s;ubtle practices, they &s;till endeavour to en&s;nare you. They u&s;e arts and tricks, and tell you lies, to deceive you; and if you would make u&s;e of your own eyes, and not be deluded by their je&s;uits and interpreters, you would &s;ee this your|&s;elves: for you know they have no goods of any value, the&s;e &s;everal years pa&s;t, except what has been &s;ent to them from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of <HI>New York,</HI> and that is now all over. They give fair &s;peeches, in&s;tead of real &s;ervices; and as, for many years, they attempted to de&s;troy you in war, &s;o they now
<PB N="142" REF="034421_0142_0FFEA8DBB963C9A8">
endeavour to do it in peace; for when they per|&s;uade you to go out to war again&s;t others, it is only that you may be de&s;troyed your&s;elves; which we, as your true friends, labour to prevent; be|cau&s;e we would have your numbers increa&s;e, that you may grow &s;trong, and that we may be all &s;trengthened in friend&s;hip and peace together.</P>
<P>"As to what you have &s;aid of trade, I &s;uppo&s;e the great di&s;tance, at which you live from us, has prevented all commerce between us and your peo|ple. We believe tho&s;e, who go into the woods, and &s;pend all their time upon it, endeavour to make the be&s;t bargains they can, for them&s;elves; &s;o, on your part, you mu&s;t take care to make the be&s;t bargains you can with them. But we hope our traders do not exact; for we think that a &s;trowd coat, or a pound of powder, is now &s;old for no more buck &s;kins than formerly. Beaver, indeed, is not, of late, &s;o much u&s;ed in <HI>Europe;</HI> and, therefore, does not give &s;o good a price; and we deal but very little in that commodity. But deer &s;kins &s;ell very well among us; and I &s;hall always take care that the <HI>Indians</HI> be not wronged. But, ex|cept other mea&s;ures be taken to regulate the <HI>Indian</HI> trade every where, the common method u&s;ed in trade will &s;till be followed; and every man mu&s;t take care of him&s;elf; for thus I mu&s;t do my&s;elf, when I buy any thing from our own people; if I do not give them their price, they will keep it; for we are a free people. But if you have any further propo&s;als to make about the&s;e affairs, I am willing to hear and con&s;ider them; for it is my de&s;ire that the trade be well regulated to your content.</P>
<P>"I am &s;en&s;ible rum is very hurtful to the <HI>Indi|ans;</HI> we have made laws, that none &s;hould be car|ried among&s;t them; or, if any is, that it &s;hould be &s;taved, and thrown upon the ground; and the

Indians have been ordered to de&s;troy all the rum, that comes in their way, but they will not do it; they will have rum; and when we refu&s;e it, they will travel to the neighbouring provinces and fetch it; their own women go to purcha&s;e it, and then &s;ell it among&s;t their own people, at exce&s;&s;ive rates. I would gladly make any laws to prevent this, that could be effectual; but the country is &s;o wide, the woods are &s;o dark and private, and &s;o far out of my &s;ight, if the <HI>Indians</HI> them&s;elves do not prohi|bit their own people, there is no other way to prevent it; for my part, I &s;hall readily join in any mea&s;ures, that can be propo&s;ed, for &s;o good a purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>"I have now, my friends and brothers, &s;aid all, that I think can be of &s;ervice, at this time, and I give you the&s;e things here laid before you, to confirm my words, <HI>viz.</HI> Five coats, twenty pounds of powder, forty pounds of lead, for each of the <HI>Five Nations;</HI> that is, twenty-five coats, one hundred pounds of powder, and two hundred pounds of lead, in the whole; which I de&s;ire may be delivered to them, with the&s;e words, in my name, and on behalf of this province: I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee often &s;ome of your chief men, &s;ent in the name of all the re&s;t; and de&s;ire you will come to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to vi&s;it our families, and our chil|dren born there, where we can provide better for you, and make you more welcome; for people always receive their friends be&s;t at their own hou&s;es.

<P>About this time the province appears to have been under great difficulties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scheme for a paper cur|rency fir&s;t introduced into Penn|&s;ylvania, 11th mo. 1722.</NOTE> re&s;pecting the de|cay, or di&s;couragement, of its trade and credit, and the want of a &s;ufficient medium, or currency, of ca&s;h; for the relief of which divers propo&s;als were made; and among the re&s;t, that of <HI>paper money,</HI> or <HI>paper bills of credit,</HI> was now intro|duced; which occa&s;ioned con&s;iderable debate, between men of different &s;entiments, re&s;pecting it.</P>

But divers, who were con&s;idered as per&s;ons of mo&s;t property, judgment and weight, in the province, did not like the &s;cheme: but then their di&s;like was chiefly founded on the difficulty of pre&s;erving the &s;aid <HI>currency</HI> from <HI>depreciation;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the in|troduction of the paper currency.</NOTE> which they &s;aw, had, in general, occa&s;ioned mi&s;|chievous and fraudulent con&s;equences, in other provinces; together with &s;ome modes, which were propo&s;ed, of i&s;&s;uing and conducting the &s;ame; &s;o that their oppo&s;ition was not &s;o much entirely

<HEAD>To the honourable Hou&s;e of <HI>Repre&s;entatives</HI> of the province of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania,</HI> in A&s;&s;embly met, the 24th of January, 1722-23.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e the honourable Hou&s;e,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We beg leave to lay before you &s;ome con&s;iderations, in an&s;wer to the <HI>&s;entiments of &s;everal gentlemen and merchants,</HI> in relation to a <HI>paper cre|dit</HI> which they were admitted to pre&s;ent, the tenth in&s;tant.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is but ju&s;t to concede to their notion, that this province is dependent on, and derives all its powers from, <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and that it is the highe&s;t wi&s;dom, in our Legi&s;lature, to direct them&s;elves by the &s;ame prudent mea&s;ures, as far as our circum&s;tances with theirs may agree.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is by them alledged, that when the nation was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by war, and their coin generally deba&s;ed, yet the parliament would not advance their currency, on any account; and that they renewed it, at the &s;ame finene&s;s, to pa&s;s at the former rates; and they have unaltera|bly kept to the &s;ame. And further, that <HI>twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds</HI> made good to private per&s;ons all their lo&s;s, received from exchanging their clipped and deba&s;ed coin, for the new milled money, delivered at par: to which we &s;ay, that we know (by what authority &s;oever it was, or is done) that &s;ince, if not then, the coin hath been (particularly the gold) often rai&s;ed and lowered; and that the <HI>twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds</HI> did make good all the lo&s;s in the kingdom, for the deba&s;ed coin, is an a&s;&s;ertion, we doubt not, but there are many, in <HI>Great Britain</HI> (and &s;ome here) can inform tho&s;e gentlemen otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> In concurrence with the &s;entiments of the&s;e gentlemen, in their third paragraph, we humbly recommend it to our legi&s;lators, that our bills be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon &s;o ju&s;t a foundation, that, while in being, they may &s;till continue of the &s;ame value with real money, according to the rates, at which they are fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> If tho&s;e bills cannot be procured, where they are to be i&s;&s;ued, for a le&s;s pledge or &s;ecurity, than gold, or &s;ilver, would be, the ea&s;y terms of refunding them will not le&s;&s;en their value; for the &s;tamp of authority has its own laws, as unalterable in them&s;elves, as tho&s;e of intere&s;t, or increa&s;e, are in u&s;ury; and which, &s;uch as are ver&s;ed in tho&s;e affairs, as carefully con&s;ider.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> The &s;chemes mo&s;t commonly talked of, for lending out &s;ums to be di&s;charged by annual payments, equal to, or not much exceed|ing the intere&s;t, for a certain number of years, without paying any prin|cipal, are not partial and unju&s;t, nor de&s;tructive to the public credit; for the pledge &s;ecured is more than an equivalent to the &s;um received, and the intere&s;t given is not incon&s;iderable, even, of the lowe&s;t rated &s;chemes. To whom are they partial and unju&s;t, &s;ince no method is propo&s;ed, or contrived, for any particular man, or men, excluding others? The benefit is to be general; and though the nece&s;&s;ities of the poor chiefly call for the &s;uccour, yet it is more within the compa&s;s of the rich to be thereby fa|voured; becau&s;e they have plenty of pledges: let them not, then, complain of partiality, or inju&s;tice, through their own negligence. How are &s;uch &s;chemes de&s;tructive to public credit, &s;ince the public is capable of yield|ing &s;o much relief to a nece&s;&s;itous people, without hurting it&s;elf? No, the de&s;ign is laudable, and greatly becomes our generous <HI>patriots.</HI> But, perhaps, there are &s;ome, that are partial to them&s;elves, although they &s;eem to &s;peak in defence of the public, affording us room to gue&s;s, they would have no money borrowed, but of private per&s;ons, and begrudge the borrowers of the public, the gain of near <HI>thirty pounds,</HI> according to the exqui&s;ite calculation of tho&s;e gentlemen; becau&s;e they them&s;elves know, that &s;uch an advantage is not equal to the &s;weet incomes of u&s;ury.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> All &s;uch projects are not exceedingly weak and unju&s;t; for what man, had he money by him to lend, would refu&s;e it, on &s;ufficient &s;ecurity? And if he does lend it, on &s;uch &s;ecurity, where can we &s;uppo&s;e the lender's lo&s;s to be? Or, wherein is the paper credit le&s;&s;ened, when there is more than its value to &s;upport it? Their &s;uppo&s;ing it to be lent to all, is an amu&s;ement; and the tribunal is ea&s;y to be erected, to find out per&s;ons of worth, from tho&s;e that are worth nothing; and the poor (who, they &s;ay, have as little merit as any) may have a chance to get it by labour, by the employers having &s;omething to pay both to their own, and the poor man's advantage: and thus a way may ea&s;ily be found for di&s;pen&s;ing the public favours. We pre&s;ume to add, to the&s;e great and rich men (and, therefore, according to their account, &s;ober and indu&s;tri|ous men) that we humbly hope a medium, in bu&s;ine&s;s, will run us from the loo&s;e way of luxury, idlene&s;s and folly, which often, happens from be|ing <HI>non-plus'd</HI> in a regular di&s;patch of affairs, for want of pay, when due.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> This currency, or paper money, will not fall in value, it rai&s;ed on a good foundation, as recommended in the third article. The ri&s;e of &s;ilver is alone owing to the avarice of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; who, know|ing there is no other currency (and that too, at this time, extremely &s;carce) they have impo&s;ed on the nece&s;&s;ities of the people, by advancing it near <HI>two &s;hillings</HI> in the pound; but it is not improbable that our bills, being always capable of purcha&s;ing our country produce, their value be|ing equal to &s;ilver, will again reduce it to its &s;tated worth, and be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;atisfactory to the kind lender, who, (according to them) relieved the borrower in di&s;tre&s;s, or &s;old him land, or goods, at the real value, at the time of lending, or &s;ale.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> Tho&s;e do not deceive them&s;elves, who, becau&s;e gold and &s;ilver may be had, at <HI>New York,</HI> or other places, in exchange for their paper money, &s;uppo&s;e that the one is as good as the other. It is a re|ceived maxim, that the value of any thing is in proportion to what it will purcha&s;e: now paper bills will, at this time, and would formerly, purcha&s;e, in <HI>New York,</HI> goods cheaper than ca&s;h will, at <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> and it is obvious that &s;ome other rea&s;on may have occa&s;ioned the ri&s;e of &s;ilver and gold there; &s;ince we have here advanced, at lea&s;t, <HI>&s;ix pence</HI> per ounce, on &s;ilver, beyond the rate a&s;certained by act of parliament, without any &s;uch motive as paper money.</P>
<P>The&s;e being premi&s;ed on the general heads, what next follows is in an&s;wer to their three conclu&s;ive points.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. If the whole &s;um &s;truck be &s;o &s;mall, that it will not an&s;wer the ab&s;olute and immediate nece&s;&s;ities of tho&s;e who have real &s;ecurities to give, it will not (we humbly conceive) be &s;ufficient to pa&s;s from hand to hand, for a currency.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That which is a benefit to any per&s;on, for five years, will be a further benefit, for a longer term; and, perhaps, the fixing it to a &s;hort date may abridge &s;ome per&s;ons from effecting what they might accom|pli&s;h for their own good, and the country's advantage, in more time. The difficulty of exchanging worn out bills for new, in an office to be erected for that purpo&s;e, we doubt not the care and ability of this A&s;|&s;embly to &s;urmount, and render practicable. And, if our laws can con|tinue in force no longer than five years, without the royal approbation, yet we pre&s;ume a law &s;o beneficial to the &s;ubject here, &s;o concurrent to the practice of neighbouring colonies, and no ways repugnant to the laws of <HI>England,</HI> will, when duly repre&s;ented at home, not want that ap|probation.</P>
<P N="3">3d. We confide in this, that the wi&s;dom of this <HI>honourable Hou&s;e</HI> needs no direction, in the care to be taken, of &s;inking the <HI>paper currency</HI> in cour&s;e, and in a ju&s;t manner; for we e&s;teem you (and not the&s;e gen|tlemen petitioners) to be proper judges of the methods hitherto di&s;cour&s;|ed of.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations, may it plea&s;e this honourable Hou&s;e, on the &s;entiments of tho&s;e gentlemen, we humbly offer to your con&s;ideration, and pray your favourable con&s;truction.</P>
</LETTER><P>Soon after the preceding an&s;wer was delivered to the Hou&s;e, it was followed by a paper, in reply to it, containing, <HI>the further &s;entiments of the gentlemen, merchants,</HI> &amp;c. on the &s;ame &s;ubject, <HI>viz.</HI></P><LETTER>
<HEAD>To the honourable Hou&s;e of <HI>Repre&s;entatives</HI> of the province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Further &s;entiments, &amp;c.</NOTE>In the important affair of a <HI>paper credit,</HI> now under the con&s;idera|tion of your Hou&s;e, it is to be hoped that all hone&s;t men, among&s;t us, think of it from the &s;ame principles, and with the &s;ame inclinations, <HI>viz.</HI> to promote the true intere&s;t and reputation of this colony.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e views alone we lately took the liberty to petition your honourable Hou&s;e, to be heard upon the &s;ubject, and the next day ex|hibited our &s;entiments, in writing, drawn into &s;everal heads, and built, on &s;uch &s;olid foundations of truth, that we are well a&s;&s;ured they cannot be &s;haken.</P>
<P>Yet, as the opinions of men are extremely various, and great pains have, of late, been taken here, to in&s;til and &s;trengthen popular errors, on that &s;ubject; we find divers of the&s;e drawn up, in a paper, lately pre&s;ented to, and received by, the Hou&s;e; containing, as it &s;ays, &s;ome con&s;iderations, in an&s;wer to our &s;aid &s;entiments, but truly con&s;i&s;ting, in a great mea&s;ure, of tho&s;e common mi&s;takes, which have unhappily oc|ca&s;ioned &s;uch differences in opinion, even, among the well-meaning, who, we pre&s;ume, all aim at the public good.</P>
<P>The more clearly, therefore, to manife&s;t the&s;e popular deceptions, to prevent the unhappy con&s;equence, that may attend their obtaining further place, and more effectually to e&s;tabli&s;h the truth and certainty of tho&s;e heads, we before pre&s;ented, we humbly beg leave to offer the fol|lowing ob&s;ervations, on the &s;everal parts of that paper, with &s;ome <HI>fur|ther &s;entiments,</HI> on the whole matter; which, we hope, will be inter|preted according to their true intention, that is, to &s;erve the public, in which we are all jointly embarked.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of what we then exhibited to the Hou&s;e (as is evident from all the parts of it) was not to oppo&s;e a <HI>paper credit,</HI> but to &s;hew the danger of ill concerted &s;chemes, and to point out, as far as was then proper, what we conceived to be the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures, for an|&s;wering all the ju&s;t ends, propo&s;ed by &s;uch a credit.</P>
<P>In the three fir&s;t articles was repre&s;ented how much it became us, as a government depending on Britain, to copy after the great examples, their parliaments have &s;et before us; particularly the&s;e two ca&s;es of keeping our coin con&s;tantly to the &s;ame rates, and &s;upporting the credit of our bills, when i&s;&s;ued, equivalent to &s;uch money.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t of the&s;e, tho&s;e, concerned in that paper, are obliged to concede.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd they an&s;wer with a gro&s;s mi&s;take, and an unbecom|ing trifling: for, it is po&s;itively true, that &s;ince the great reformation of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> coin, in 1696, there has not been the lea&s;t alteration in it; <HI>guineas,</HI> which, till lately, never were a legal tender, were limited that year, that they &s;hould not, under a penalty, be received at more than <HI>twenty-two &s;hillings</HI> each. But no &s;ooner did <HI>&s;ilver,</HI> the true lawful mo|ney of the kingdom, circulate freely again, which, by the great dili|gence of the &s;everal mints, they did, within &s;ix months after; but the people refu&s;ed to take them at more than <HI>twenty-one &s;hillings and &s;ix pence,</HI> as formerly; at which rate they have con&s;tantly continued, till the mines of <HI>America,</HI> e&s;pecially of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> producing much more gold than &s;ilver, in value, the fir&s;t has fallen, in <HI>Europe;</HI> on which, to prevent the ex|portation of &s;ilver, they are, by a late act of parliament, reduced to <HI>twenty-one &s;hillings;</HI> and at that rate, at length, made a legal tender, that is, lawful money of the nation. If foreign gold, or &s;ilver, be meant, which are only merchandize, and ri&s;e, as the demand is for ex|portation, the&s;e are entirely out of the que&s;tion. To the other part, where they alledge, that the <HI>twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds</HI> did not make good all the lo&s;s, in the kingdom; we &s;ay, that our informations are as good as any can pretend to, in this province.</P>
<P>That &s;um, on large trials, made in the exchequer, of the monies re|ceived the year before, was judged &s;ufficient to make good the whole lo&s;s; and all, who brought in their money, within the time limited, had it made good to them. It is true, &s;ome per&s;ons di&s;affected to the go|vernment, and others fond of their hoards, forbore, and &s;uffered accord|ingly, but the great care of the parliament, and therefore the truth of our a&s;&s;ertion, are from hence equally clear.</P>
<P>The third head, which is the greate&s;t point, of keeping up our bills to the &s;ame value with real money, according to the rates, or which they are, at fir&s;t, i&s;&s;ued, is al&s;o conceded, in general terms; and the ju&s;t foundation mentioned, is all that is contended for.</P>
<P>But what is advanced in the fourth and fifth articles, is the grand popular error, that endangers a di&s;appointment, in that great end pro|po&s;ed. For no &s;tamp of authority can give an intrin&s;ic worth, where it really is not. Experience, who&s;e in&s;tructions, even the weake&s;t may reach, will &s;hew us, that bills of credit have been i&s;&s;ued in no place on this continent, where they have not, &s;ooner or later, &s;unk below the value, at which they were, at fir&s;t, made; and yet they all had as pow|erful a &s;tamp of authority as any we can give. We are now upon put|ting in practice a project of the &s;ame kind; it is, therefore, the more highly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncumbent on us, prudently and advi&s;edly to con&s;ider, in time, by what means the inconveniences, that have attended others, in theirs, may be prevented in our undertaking.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t remark, we offered, on this head, was from this founda|tion, that, if the public, by their terms of i&s;&s;uing their bills, &s;hew they e&s;timate them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> le&s;s than they would real money; all mankind, but e&s;|pecially the trader, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to exchange his commodity for its real value, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> naturally be taught to do the &s;ame. The greatne&s;s of the &s;ecurity ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es no manner of difference, unle&s;s the borrower of the bills &s;hould be obliged, for <HI>one hundred pounds</HI> lent in them, to repay, upon that &s;ecurity, the like &s;um of gold or &s;ilver, and not in the &s;ame &s;pecie; for &s;hould one, upon lending any rarity, of no great intrin&s;ic va|lue, take a &s;ecurity of <HI>one hundred pounds,</HI> to have it returned, this would not add to the real worth of the thing lent, though it &s;hewed, the len|der re&s;olved to have it re&s;tored to him; or, if a man &s;hould a&s;&s;ign the bond of another per&s;on of dubious credit, for <HI>one hundred pounds</HI> due, for the con&s;ideration of <HI>fifty pounds</HI> only, to be paid by the a&s;&s;ignee, in twelve months, to the a&s;&s;ignor; and for the payment of the <HI>fifty pounds,</HI> &s;hould take a mortgage, or &s;ecurity, worth <HI>five hundred pounds,</HI> this in|deed will make the debt of <HI>fifty</HI> more certainly good, but will not add one farthing to the value of the bond a&s;&s;igned, in the &s;ame manner, if a per&s;on be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>fifty pounds,</HI> in bills of credit, though there be a &s;ecurity of <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two hundred pounds</HI> given for them, in the office, by the borrower, of the fir&s;t taking of them out, &s;hould the&s;e bills, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, that have prevailed in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and other places, in the li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ca&s;e, &s;ink in their value, and become worth le&s;s than <HI>forty pounds,</HI> while in that per&s;on's hands, the &s;ecurity given will, in no manner, compen|&s;ate that lo&s;s to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; for neither he, nor even the public, can have any &s;atisfaction from the &s;ecurity; becau&s;e, if the borrower re|turns the bills again, when due from him, though they &s;hould not then be worth <HI>twenty pounds</HI> of that coin, by which they were fir&s;t rated, his &s;ecurity will be entirely di&s;charged by the payment. This is mo&s;t evi|dent and plain to any man of rea&s;on, who will make u&s;e of it: but per|&s;ons over-run with the common notions, depending on the applau&s;e of &s;uch as are ready prepared to give it to every thing, favouring their own opinions, may think it &s;ufficient for an&s;wering the mo&s;t certain truth, barely to deny it, and confide in the numbers, that are to &s;upport their a&s;&s;ertions; which we conceive has been the only motive to tho&s;e per&s;ons, who drew up, or pre&s;ented the paper, now under con&s;ideration; but the unhand&s;ome reflections, that are ca&s;t, in that part of it, &s;hall, for the pre&s;ent, be waved, and referred to the clo&s;e of this, as a more proper place.</P>
<P>In our fifth and &s;ixth heads we a&s;&s;erted, that &s;uch &s;chemes as were then commonly talked of, were partial, weak and unju&s;t; as they were intended to make grants very beneficial to the fir&s;t borrower, but injuri|ous to the others: that all would equally covet the &s;ame advantage; but that, from the nature of the thing, all could not po&s;&s;ibly partake of it; unle&s;s the quantity of the bills were &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t as to render them of little, or no value. The truth of all which is &s;o clear and plain, that it would be little le&s;s than a mockery to human rea&s;on, to offer arguments for &s;upporting what, if under&s;tood, is &s;elf-evident. But this is now entire|ly out of time, the wi&s;dom of the A&s;&s;embly having admitted none of tho&s;e &s;chemes, there guarded again&s;t, and it will be difficult to find a rea&s;on for offering that part of the paper to the Hou&s;e, after all the votes, that have been pa&s;&s;ed on this affair, unle&s;s it be to prepare, with an extreme mode&s;ty, for another pu&s;h, to over&s;et all that has hitherto been voted.</P>
<P>Their whole an&s;wer to the &s;eventh head is grounded on another great mi&s;take, in the cau&s;e of the ri&s;e of &s;ilver among&s;t us; which is truly thus: In the year 1709, when the act of parliament, for reducing our coin, took place, &s;ilver was our common currency; gold being then but rarely &s;een; but as it was judged nece&s;&s;ary (&s;eeing the act was &s;ilent in it) to make that al&s;o, as well as &s;ilver, pa&s;s current by weight, at &s;ome determinate rate; and being, at that time, worth four pounds an ounce, or four &s;hillings per penny weight, in <HI>Britain,</HI> it was advanced in the &s;ame proportion with &s;il|ver, (<HI>viz.</HI> one third) to <HI>five &s;hillings and four pence</HI> per penny weight; but becau&s;e this &s;um could not be &s;o divided by twenty-four, as to render it practicable to reckon &s;ingle grains by farthings, without a fraction, it was, by common con&s;ent, rai&s;ed to <HI>five &s;hillings and &s;ix pence,</HI> that a grain might be accounted at <HI>two pence three farthings.</HI> This &s;eeming &s;mall difference, with the advance given in <HI>England</HI> by the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> compa|ny for <HI>Spani&s;h &s;ilver,</HI> wrought &s;o great a change in our currency, that our payments were mo&s;tly made in gold, <HI>New York and Britain</HI> gradu|ally exhau&s;ting our &s;ilver; in&s;omuch that, even, nine or ten years ago, five per cent. advance was given, in gold, in exchange for <HI>Spani&s;h &s;il|ver;</HI> though afterwards, upon a greater importation of the latter, this difference, for &s;ome time, abated; but gold having &s;till further fallen in value, in <HI>Britain,</HI> the di&s;parity has again further increa&s;ed; for account|ing pieces of eight, only at <HI>five &s;hillings and four pence</HI> per ounce, which is under a medium for their common price; and gold at <HI>three pounds eighteen &s;hillings,</HI> which is near its pre&s;ent, or late value, in <HI>England;</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ounce of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;ilver is truly equivalent to <HI>&s;even &s;hillings and &s;ix pence,</HI> in gold, at <HI>five pounds ten &s;hillings</HI> per ounce, as we rate it. It is there|fore, neither <HI>avarice,</HI> nor <HI>&s;harping,</HI> that has occa&s;ioned this advance, in the exchange of the&s;e two metals, but the e&s;&s;ential difference, in their intrin&s;ic value, at the market, to which they are carried; which is e&s;|timated by rules, that ever will prevail among competent rea&s;oners on the ba&s;is of trade; though &s;uch, as go beyond their <HI>la&s;t,</HI> will meddle with matters out of their &s;phere, are uncapable of comprehending them.</P>
<P>But, from hence a &s;ure rule may be taken, in relation to paper that by &s;o much as the value of public bills &s;ink, by &s;o much will gold and &s;ilver ri&s;e, in proportion to their intrin&s;ic worth; as we find our &s;il|ver has done, in proportion to our gold; and the con&s;tant &s;tandard, to mea&s;ure this by, will be the exchange between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colony, where they are made current, and <HI>Great Britain.</HI> From hence the lo&s;s on bills is to be e&s;timated in all places, where they pa&s;s: the exchange in <HI>New York,</HI> before the bills fell, <HI>viz.</HI> in 1716, was <HI>fifty</HI> per cent. and in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> not long before; but &s;ince 1717, the year they uttered their la&s;t great quantity of bills, it aro&s;e to <HI>&s;ixty-five</HI> per cent. and in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> it is now near <HI>one hundred and fifty</HI> per cent. as in <HI>Carolina,</HI> it is from <HI>five to &s;ix cents</HI> advance on <HI>one hundred pounds &s;terling.</HI></P>
<P>The an&s;wer to the eighth is of a piece with the re&s;t, a pre&s;umptu|ous denial of a po&s;itive truth, that is in it&s;elf inconte&s;tible; for the lan|guage of the <HI>New York</HI> bill runs thus, <HI>viz.</HI> for a bill of <HI>twenty &s;hillings; "This bill, of two ounces ten penny weight of plate, due from the colony of New York to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or thereof, &s;hall be equal, in value, to Seville pillar,</HI> or <HI>Mexico plate,"</HI> &amp;c. And yet that very bill &s;hall, at this time, purcha&s;e very little more, (if any thing) in pieces of eight, than <HI>two ounces.</HI> It is, therefore, undeniably true, that &s;uch a bill is not equivalent to <HI>two ounces and a half</HI> of &s;uch plate; becau&s;e, being fallen from its fir&s;t in|tended value, it will not purcha&s;e &s;o much: and it is really &s;urpri&s;ing how any men, in direct contradiction to common &s;en&s;e, can amu&s;e them&s;elves and others with &s;uch groundle&s;s notions. The price of goods at <HI>New York,</HI> whether cheaper or dearer, than at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> is out of the que&s;|tion; unle&s;s it could be alledged, that a bill of <HI>twenty &s;hillings</HI> will pur|cha&s;e as much of tho&s;e goods, as can be bought with the real weight of <HI>two ounces and a half</HI> of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;ilver; which the bolde&s;t a&s;&s;ertor will &s;carce venture to affirm.</P>
<P>We further beg leave to ob&s;erve, on their an&s;wer to the three la&s;t articles:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That to &s;upply the want of a medium for commerce is the hone&s;t intention of the propo&s;al for <HI>bills of credit,</HI> and not to di&s;charge the debts of tho&s;e who want means, from the public, to get clear of them.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> All bills, bonds, &amp;c. on an equal &s;ecurity, are the more valued, the &s;ooner they become due; and the &s;ooner public bills are to &s;ink, the greater will be their credit. It is true, that the longer the time is, the more ea&s;y it may &s;eem to the fir&s;t borrower; but, in the whole cour&s;e of the bills, after their &s;econd payment, this will but di|mini&s;h their credit. If <HI>eight</HI> years be preferable to <HI>five,</HI> becau&s;e of the length of the time, the &s;ame argument may be urged for <HI>&s;ixteen</HI> or <HI>twenty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> It is extremely mannerly (we grant) to leave it entirely to the A&s;&s;embly, to con&s;ider the manner of &s;inking the bills; but this com|plai&s;ance, it is doubted, is more owing to an unconcernedne&s;s in that point, when, or whether ever, they &s;ink, provided they are once obtain|ed, than to any real mode&s;ty; otherwi&s;e, it was certainly a breach of that, after the Hou&s;e had voted both the &s;um and the time, not to ac|quie&s;ce in their wi&s;dom, but to &s;olicit an enlargement.</P>
<P>We pay as great a deference, may it plea&s;e the Hou&s;e, to the legi&s;|lative authority, as any others; yet we well know their wi&s;dom will in|fluence them to lend con&s;tantly an open ear to all nece&s;&s;ary hints from without doors, that may contribute any advantage to the important af|fairs, brought from time to time, under their con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>From hence it is, that we &s;hall yet crave liberty to offer our further &s;entiments, not only in relation to a paper credit, but upon &s;ome other points, that nearly concern the pro&s;perity of this colony.</P>
<P>Such bills, we find, have been i&s;&s;ued in <HI>America,</HI> on two different, foundations; the one has been to rai&s;e a large &s;um immediately, on the credit of future taxes, duties, &amp;c. by which they were to be regularly &s;unk in time; the other to be lent out on &s;ecurities, and to be &s;unk by the borrowers repaying them into the trea&s;ury. Tho&s;e of <HI>New York</HI> and <HI>South Carolina</HI> were by the fir&s;t method, and tho&s;e of <HI>New England.</HI> and <HI>Rhode I&s;land,</HI> by the &s;econd.</P>
<P>In <HI>Carolina</HI> they were obliged, for the defence of their town and country, again&s;t &s;ome threatened inva&s;ions, to rai&s;e an immen&s;e &s;um, for &s;o &s;mall a colony, va&s;tly exceeding the occa&s;ions they had for a currency, e&s;pecially &s;ince their <HI>rice,</HI> which foreigners come to carry away, will purcha&s;e mo&s;t of the goods they want; and this &s;unk the credit of their bills to the low &s;tate they were depre&s;&s;ed to. In <HI>New York,</HI> their fir&s;t bills, rai&s;ed by the &s;ame method, <HI>viz.</HI> by anticipating the duties, by which they were to be &s;unk again, kept up their credit; and, becau&s;e of the certainty of their terminating, and the quantity being moderate, for a place of &s;uch large and extended commerce, they continued of equal value with their current &s;ilver, until the year 1717, when they i&s;&s;ued another large &s;um&punc; and for a longer term; upon which their credit im|mediately fell to a di&s;parity with their real money.</P>
<P>Farther to the ca&s;tward, their bills being i&s;&s;ued on loans only, by which method they cannot be called in, with &s;o much certainty, they con&s;equently fell more than one third below the value, at which they were fir&s;t &s;truck; and the &s;ame may be expected from the like mea&s;ures to happen here; for &s;eeing very few borrowers are found to di&s;charge their mortgages to private per&s;ons, in time, and according to contract, it will be expected that the public, to whom &s;uch loud cries are rai&s;ed, for &s;uccour to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, will rather be more indulgent, than ri|gorous, to their humble &s;uppliants.</P>
<P>It will, therefore, be evident, that to keep up the credit of bills, the quantity mu&s;t be moderate, and &s;hould be &s;omewhat under a &s;uffici|ency for a circulating currency, that we may, as they do in <HI>New York,</HI> contrive means to &s;upply our&s;elves with &s;ome quantities of ca&s;h, which is real trea&s;ure in a country, while bills are no more than borrowing from one another without adding one penny to the wealth or &s;tock of the colony; and next, that a certainty of their being &s;unk in a rea&s;ona|ble time, will principally contribute to &s;upport that credit.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved before, in the la&s;t article, pre&s;ented by us, to the Hou&s;e, that &s;uch mea&s;ures ought to be taken for this, as &s;hall render it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the public, that the bills &s;hall be &s;unk regularly.</P>
<P>It is therefore, upon the whole, with all due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, propo&s;ed to the con&s;ideration of the Hou&s;e, whether it may not be rather requi&s;ite to retrench the quantity, la&s;t voted, than to augment it, as &s;ome de|&s;ire; con&s;idering that <HI>ten pounds</HI> of that currency will probably cir|culate more and fa&s;ter than <HI>twenty</HI> or <HI>thirty</HI> of gold or &s;ilver; becau&s;e the latter has a con&s;tant intrin&s;ic value, while the other, more &s;ubject to change, and de&s;igned only for a medium of commerce, will be more bri&s;kly &s;hifted from hand to hand, to an&s;wer that pupo&s;e? and whether the following methods of applying it may not render it more &s;erviceable; <HI>viz.</HI> that, &s;eeing the public is now, by the Trea&s;urer's account, be&s;ides &s;ome other &s;ums not yet &s;ettled, above <HI>one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred pounds</HI> in debt, and the &s;upport, for the en&s;uing year, is yet to be provided for, a &s;um of about <HI>three thou&s;and pounds,</HI> to be paid out of the bills, to be &s;unk, by an exci&s;e, or &s;uch other method as the Hou&s;e &s;hall be&s;t approve of, for returning that &s;um, in three, four or five years, as &s;hall be judged mo&s;t convenient.</P>
<P>That a &s;um, &s;ufficient to fini&s;h the <HI>pri&s;on and workhou&s;e</HI> of <HI>Philadel|phia,</HI> be lent out of the bills of the city and county, to be returned into the trea&s;ury, by a yearly tax on the inhabitants, not exceeding one <HI>penny per pound,</HI> till the &s;aid &s;um be di&s;charged; the pre&s;ent taxes of <HI>three pence per pound</HI> being too heavy, in the&s;e difficult times, for the public to bear.</P>
<P>That the re&s;t be lent out, as is already propo&s;ed to the Hou&s;e, on good unque&s;tionable &s;ecurities, at the intere&s;t agreed on; but, for the better a&s;&s;uring their &s;inking, that all public monies, rai&s;ed by any taxes, exci&s;e, or duties what&s;oever, be paid into the re&s;pective trea&s;uries only in that &s;pecie, to be there &s;unk; and the full value of &s;uch public monies be made good out of the &s;ums, paid in by the borrowers, whether in coin, paper, or country produce, to an&s;wer the ends, for which the &s;ame was rai&s;ed; by which means the bills mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;unk, and the payments be duly made by the borrowers, without any excu&s;e or &s;a|vour.</P>
<P>That, for the more effectual &s;upport of the credit of the bills, <HI>&s;ix|pence in the pound</HI> be allowed to the per&s;on, who pays them in, as pub|lic money, to be made good out of the intere&s;t, paid by the borrower.</P>
<P>The&s;e mea&s;ures, may it plea&s;e the Hou&s;e, it is believed, will very much contribute to an&s;wer the ju&s;t ends, propo&s;ed by the bills, with the lea&s;t injury, or lo&s;s, to the receivers.</P>
<P>The reflections, in this la&s;t paper, as well as others, which have indu&s;triou&s;ly been rendered popular, &s;hall be an&s;wered, by &s;hewing, from the &s;tate of the country, how de&s;tructive to its true intere&s;t that &s;pirit is, to which too many appear to have re&s;igned them&s;elves, that tho&s;e, who are &s;incerely well affected to the public, may, with a more di&s;tingui&s;h|ing judgment, ob&s;erve the mea&s;ures, by which our common intere&s;t may be mo&s;t effectually promoted; for which end, we beg leave to add the following remarks, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That this &s;mall colony, con&s;i&s;ting, at pre&s;ent, only of three coun|ties, and of no extraordinary &s;oil, &s;ituate but on one &s;ide of one naviga|ble river; is, therefore, inferior, in natural advantages, to all others around us; and having no produce, but what other colonies, more com|modiou&s;ly &s;ituated, not only rival us in, but, of late, have outdone us, we cannot, therefore, equally flouri&s;h with others, unle&s;s we compen&s;ate the&s;e natural defects, by &s;uch improvements, in indu&s;try, and other good qualities, as may de&s;ervedly acquire us a reputation.</P>
<P>That the hu&s;bandman and merchant are the principal &s;upporters of the colony, from whom all other kinds of bu&s;ine&s;s, among us, receive their encouragement; the one rai&s;ing the produce, and the other export|ing it by navigation.</P>
<P>That, by the common methods of our trade, for want of a vent abroad, for our wheat, and what is manufactured from it, we can never become con&s;iderable; and therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary that the countryman &s;hould endeavour for &s;ome other improvements, and the merchant labour to find out new channels for commere, by pur&s;uing it in all the branches, that may lie open to us, in other countries; for both the&s;e will ever, in reality, have a natural dependence on each other.</P>
<P>That it is an unhappine&s;s to this country, that there are not more wealthy men in trade, who, by large &s;tocks, could force &s;uch an extend|ed commerce, as in <HI>New York</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> for by the&s;e means more &s;hip|ping, and therefore, more workmen and people would be employed; and both a greater exportation and con&s;umption of the country produce, to the encouragement of the farmer, would be occa&s;ioned by it.</P>
<P>That it has ever been accounted a great advantage to a country, to have men in it, who can &s;upply others with money, in their nece&s;&s;ities, on &s;uch terms as the laws approve; for, from &s;uch opportunities, the indu&s;trious and ingenious, who, for want of &s;omething in their hands, might be ever tied down to poverty, may find means to rai&s;e them&s;elves (as many have done) to fortunes and a capacity of being extremely u&s;e|ful; from hence many have received va&s;t advantages, by compa&s;&s;ing bargains, that otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t, forever have gone without. In &s;hort, there is nothing more equitable than that the active and indu&s;trious &s;hould, for a moderate con&s;ideration, have the u&s;e of other men's &s;tocks, who either for want of &s;kill, or inclination, cannot employ it them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>That the wealth of a country con&s;i&s;ts of the riches of its inhabi+tants, and the richer any country is, the better it is for a poor man to live in. All the&s;e being unque&s;tionable truths, it is as a&s;toni&s;hing to con&s;ider, while we have &s;carce one man in the country, that can be ac|counted rich, when compared with divers in other colonies; while the province really &s;uffers for want of more men of ability, to promote its intere&s;t, and enlarge its commerce; on which great numbers of the people have their dependance; while money can &s;carce be had on any terms, to lend, or borrow, and &s;eldom ever could be obtained on loan, but by entreaty, and with &s;olicitation; it is a&s;toni&s;hing, we &s;ay, to con|&s;ider how it is po&s;&s;ible, that there &s;hould be any among&s;t us, who, is de&s;pite of common &s;en&s;e, will &s;uffer them&s;elves to be mi&s;led into &s;uch a &s;pirit of malignity, as, in direct oppo&s;ition to the intere&s;t of the whole, to in&s;ult and abu&s;e tho&s;e few, in the place, who are the mo&s;t capable of promoting that intere&s;t; to return reproaches for what was obtained by prayer; and under the endearing appearance of popularity, to &s;trike at the very &s;inews of a country's &s;trength, and the evident means of its pro&s;perity; in which all would, according to their ranks, be more or le&s;s partakers.</P>
<P>We humbly crave the Hou&s;e's excu&s;e for the&s;e ob&s;ervations, which the unhappy prevailing humour of the time (as the honourable Hou&s;e, from the la&s;t, and other applications, cannot but be &s;en&s;ible) has ren|dered nece&s;&s;ary, for rectifying the di&s;tempered notions of the mi&s;guided. On which no better advice (we conceive) can be recommended to &s;uch per&s;ons, than that of the apo&s;tle, viz, <HI>"To fellow after the things, which make for their peace; to &s;tudy to be quiet, and to do their own bu&s;ine&s;s,"</HI> &amp;c. as he has recommended. Rom. xiv ch. 19 ver. 1. The&s;&s;. iv ch. 11 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>Although it is true, we are, at pre&s;ent, very poor, yet love and unity appear not le&s;s wanting among us, than money; and while we are applying to the Legi&s;lature for means to &s;upply the one, if we could be &s;o happy as to join in the other, it would mere effectually render it ea&s;y to this honourable Hou&s;e to provide for our public nece&s;&s;ities, which, that we may, is the earne&s;t de&s;ire of their mo&s;t <HI>faithful friend.</HI></P>

accordingly offer the following heads, which may be &s;upported by &s;olid arguments, when the Hou&s;e thinks fit to require them.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the in|&s;titution of the paper currency.</NOTE> That as this province derives all its powers from, and is wholly dependent on the kingdom of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> it will be the highe&s;t wi&s;dom in our Legi&s;lature, upon all exigencies, to direct them&s;elves by the &s;ame prudent and ju&s;t mea&s;ures, which the parliaments of that kingdom have always pur&s;ued, in the like ca&s;es; in whom nothing has been more con&s;picuous than a mo&s;t &s;trict care, that no &s;ubject &s;hould lo&s;e by the coin, or public credit, of the kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="034421_0154_0FFD9F665A98A3B8"><HI>Secondly,</HI> That as, when the nation was mo&s;t grievou&s;ly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, in the time of a dangerous and expen&s;ive war, by a general deba&s;ing of their current coin, the parliament would hearken to no propo&s;al (though many were made) for relieving the &s;tate, by rai&s;ing the new minted money to a higher value; but, under the va&s;te&s;t difficulties, renewed it, at the &s;ame weight and finene&s;s, to pa&s;s at the former rates; which they have unalter|ably kept to. And further, by the &s;um of <HI>twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds,</HI> made good to private per&s;ons all the lo&s;s of exchanging their clipped and deba&s;ed coin, for the new milled money, which was delivered out at a par to them: &s;o the like ju&s;tice and prudence requires, that no further alteration, than what the parliament has made here, &s;hould, on any terms, be admitted, in the value of our gold and &s;ilver, but that it &s;till con|tinue, as it now pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="034421_0155_0FFD9F7311043B50"><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That, as the parliament, as often as they found it nece&s;&s;ary to i&s;&s;ue bills of credit, called exchequer bills, or notes, took the utmo&s;t ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to keep them equal in value with &s;ilver, by giving the <HI>Bank of England,</HI> when they fell into any di&s;count, va&s;t &s;ums of money, to receive tho&s;e bills, as their own, and to exchange them with ready ca&s;h, on the demand of the bearer: &s;o it appears ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that if bills of credit be rai&s;ed here, due care &s;hould be taken (&s;ince we can have no &s;uch <HI>banks,</HI> in this province, as are in <HI>Europe,</HI> who&s;e rules are to pay down ready money for their bills, upon demand) to e&s;tabli&s;h them on &s;o ju&s;t a foundation, that, while in being, they may &s;till continue of the &s;ame value with real mo|ney, according to the rates, at which they are at fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="034421_0156_0FFD9F27F69315A8"><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That, if tho&s;e bills be i&s;&s;ued on any ea&s;ier terms to the receiver, than gold, or &s;ilver would be, if it were to be paid, or lent, out of the trea&s;ury, by how much ea&s;ier the&s;e terms are, by &s;o much, at lea&s;t, will the bills fall in value; for credit has its own laws, as unalterable in them|&s;elves, as tho&s;e of motion, or gravity, are, in na|ture, and which, &s;uch, as are ver&s;ed in the&s;e affairs in <HI>Europe,</HI> as carefully con&s;ider.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> That the &s;chemes mo&s;t commonly talked of, for lending out &s;ums, to be di&s;charged by annual payments, equal to, or not much ex|ceeding, the intere&s;t, for a certain number of years, without paying any principal, are partial and unju&s;t, and would be de&s;tructive to public credit; bacau&s;e the con&s;ideration given is not an equivalent to the &s;um received.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="034421_0157_0FFD9EDEE0CEA6B0">For in&s;tance, &s;hould <HI>one hundred pounds</HI> be lent out, to be di&s;charged, by the payment only of eight pounds annually, for &s;ixteen years; were &s;uch an annuity to be bought, according to the known rules for purcha&s;ing e&s;tates, it would here be worth no more than <HI>&s;eventy pounds &s;ixteen &s;hil|lings and three pence,</HI> in ready money; nor is an annuity for nine pounds ten &s;hillings per annum, for twelve years, worth more than <HI>&s;eventy-one pounds twelve &s;hillings.</HI> In either of the&s;e ca&s;es, the borrower, could he di&s;charge debts of that value with it, though he were to pay the annuity in gold and &s;ilver, would gain near thirty pounds by the loan, but no other per&s;on would feel the lea&s;t advantage by it; now, if no man would let out his own money on the&s;e terms, none ought to de&s;ire it &s;o of the public; the credit of which is of va&s;tly greater importance, than any private per|&s;ons; becau&s;e a failure, in that, affects the fortune of every individual, in his money, the medium of his commerce and dealing.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="034421_0158_0FFD9F5BC78CC510"><HI>Sixthly,</HI> That all &s;uch projects are either ex|ceedingly weak, or unju&s;t; for the paper money is to be lent either to all, who &s;hall de&s;ire it, on a tender of the &s;ecurity, propo&s;ed, or to &s;ome only: if to all (as it is natural for all men to de&s;ire what they may gain by) it will be impracticable to &s;trike enough, to an&s;wer all demands; or, if it were &s;truck, it would, becau&s;e of its quantity, become of little, or no value; if to a few only, what tribunal can be erected, to judge and di&s;tingui&s;h, who of the King's &s;ubjects, are to be admitted to the favour, and who to be rejected? If the poor only are to be the objects, they have not &s;ecurity to give, or, if they had, perhaps they have as lit|tle merit as any: commonly people become weal|thy by &s;obriety and indu&s;try, the mo&s;t u&s;eful qua|lifications in a commonwealth, and poor by luxury, idlene&s;s and folly. What rules then can be found, for di&s;pen&s;ing the public favours?</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="034421_0159_0FFD9EE15053DAF8"><HI>Seventhly,</HI> That by the&s;e &s;chemes, the more the currency, or paper money falls in value (by which word <HI>falling,</HI> is meant the <HI>ri&s;ing</HI> of gold, &s;ilver, Engli&s;h goods, and all other commodities, in nominal value, which is the certain proof of the other's falling) the greater is the borrower's advan|tage; for the more ea&s;ily will he pay his annuity; &s;o that he may happen, by virtue of the act, to di&s;charge, with the value of twenty pounds, a debt of <HI>one hundred,</HI> due to the man, who, per|haps, kindly lent him the money, to relieve him in di&s;tre&s;s, or hone&s;tly &s;old him his land, or goods, at their real value, at the time of lending, or &s;ale.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="034421_0160_0FFD9F3ECD9F6D40"><HI>Eighthly,</HI> That all tho&s;e deceive them&s;elves, who, becau&s;e gold and &s;ilver may be had at New York, or other places, in exchange for their pa|per money, &s;uppo&s;e that the one, therefore, is as good as the other, unle&s;s the &s;ilver can be had at <HI>eight &s;hillings</HI> per ounce, or the gold at <HI>&s;ix &s;hillings</HI> per penny weight, at <HI>New York,</HI> as they were rated at the fir&s;t &s;triking of their bills; but when their &s;ilver brings from <HI>nine</HI> to <HI>ten</HI> &s;hillings per ounce, and their light pi&s;toles pa&s;s at twenty-eight &s;hillings, or higher, then bills are truly &s;o much fallen in va|lue, as the others are advanced. So, in <HI>Carolina,</HI> &s;ilver is to be purcha&s;ed for their bills, but it is at <HI>thirty &s;hillings</HI> per ounce, though they were &s;truck, as is &s;aid, at <HI>&s;even &s;hillings</HI> only!</P>
<P>The&s;e being premi&s;ed as general heads, what next follows, is to point out what are conceived to be the only means of &s;upporting the credit of &s;uch a currency, if i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="034421_0161_0FFD9F0A4F323E58"><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the whole &s;um &s;truck be but &s;mall, and ju&s;t &s;ufficient to pa&s;s from hand to hand, for a currency.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That it be not continued for any longer time; for the paper will wear out, and it will not be &s;o ea&s;y to exchange it for new, as &s;ome have imagined; which, it is much to be doubted, will be found impracticable: be&s;ides, the &s;ooner it is to expire, the more ea&s;ily will people be &s;atisfied to take it. But further, our laws can continue in force no longer than five years, without the royal approbation.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That care be taken to force the &s;ink|ing of it in cour&s;e, and in a ju&s;t manner, by mea|&s;ures, that &s;hall render it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the public to have it &s;unk; which, it is conceived,
<PB N="162" REF="034421_0162_0FFD9F4CDDFD69F8">
none of the methods hitherto di&s;cour&s;ed of will effect. The&s;e heads, may it plea&s;e the Hou&s;e, are what we have, at pre&s;ent, humbly to offer to your con&s;ideration, on this &s;ubject.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>A few days after this was pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e, the Governor al&s;o delivered them his &s;entiments, in writing, on the &s;ame &s;ubject, as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the A&s;&s;embly,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor Keith's &s;en|timents on introducing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> paper currency.</NOTE>I have, at your reque&s;t, very carefully con&s;i|dered the re&s;olutions of the Hou&s;e, upon your journals, relating to public credit; and al&s;o &s;ome things, which, I find, have been offered to you, upon the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Credit may, no doubt, be compared to the mathematics, in &s;o far as both &s;ciences will admit
<PB N="163" REF="034421_0163_0FFD9F2A65912448">
of deducing &s;olid conclu&s;ions from &s;elf-evident and clear principles; and yet, by the &s;ubtilty of an arti&s;t, truth, or fal&s;ehood, in either of them, is often &s;o wrapped up and involved, that it is lo&s;t unto, or mi&s;apprehended by the plaine&s;t, and, generally &s;peaking, much the hone&s;te&s;t part of mankind.</P>
<P>But the common nece&s;&s;ity, and general inte|re&s;t of the whole body of the people, being a &s;ub|ject of importance, on which we ought to &s;peak plainly, and act freely, I &s;hall, without any pre|amble, or di&s;gui&s;e whatever, communicate my thoughts to you, in the &s;imple&s;t, and mo&s;t intelli|gible manner, that I can.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> If it be true, that the riches and pro|&s;perity of this province chiefly depend on the ma|nufacture of provi&s;ions, and the exchanging of that manufacture, with other things, to advantage, it will al&s;o be true, that whatever increa&s;es the one, and, at the &s;ame time, encourages the other, will
<PB N="164" REF="034421_0164_0FFD9EE3C0A901A0">
ju&s;tly de&s;erve the name of a public good; and the majority of tho&s;e, employed in &s;uch manufacture and exchange, have thereby a right to be con&s;i|dered as the body of the people, whom you repre|&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is evident, that, where there is no public debt, and a real value, in lands, to be pledged, paper money may, if there is occa&s;ion for it, be &s;truck to advantage, without any ri&s;k at all; for though, perhaps, it may contribute to hurt &s;ome weak people, in the ill management of their private affairs, yet, while any unfrugal per|&s;on is lo&s;t to the community, and is &s;ucceeded by one more indu&s;trious than he, the public cannot &s;uffer by &s;uch a change.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> If, in the ca&s;e of a paper currency, among us, it &s;hould happen to follow (as it may be &s;uppo&s;ed it will) that &s;ilver and gold will be kept up for remittances to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> we &s;hall then have no other means of dealing with one ano|ther, but the paper: &s;hould the quantity, there|fore,
<PB N="165" REF="034421_0165_0FFD9F0D9D4CC350">
be le&s;s than is nece&s;&s;ary to circulate our home trade, in its natural cour&s;e, u&s;urers and &s;harpers would have the &s;ame opportunity as they have now, to lie at catch for bargains, and make a monopoly of trade, by engro&s;&s;ing the current money into their hands.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The very e&s;&s;ence and nature of cre|dit, as well as the practice and experience of the greate&s;t banks in <HI>Europe,</HI> directs all &s;uch bills to be i&s;&s;ued at &s;omething le&s;s than the common intere&s;t, for that is, in effect, a premium by the public, to encourage their circulation: and who&s;oever is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that the bank of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> lo&s;es credit, by lending money at <HI>two per cent.</HI> or the bank of <HI>England,</HI> by lending money at <HI>four per cent.</HI> &s;hall &s;carce prevail with me to think the a&s;&s;er|tion worthy of any an&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> I am not of opinion with tho&s;e gen|tlemen, who are plea&s;ed to alledge, that the value of &s;ilver, at <HI>New York,</HI> which, in the month of September la&s;t, was from <HI>eight &s;hillings</HI> and <HI>&s;ix
<PB N="166" REF="034421_0166_0FFD9EE665ADC850">
pence</HI> to <HI>eight &s;hillings</HI> and <HI>nine pence,</HI> is occa&s;ioned by their paper; for, in this province, where there never has been any paper yet, from <HI>five to ten per cent.</HI> has, for &s;everal years, been given in exchange for &s;ilver. And as to their computation of gold, the gentlemen, perhaps, have not had occa&s;ion, of late, to be informed, that the heavie&s;t <HI>pi&s;toles,</HI> in <HI>York,</HI> go at no more than <HI>twenty-eight &s;hillings,</HI> and &s;maller, or cut gold, at the common &s;tandard value, in that province; where, it is believed, the people could not po&s;&s;ibly carry on half the quantity of their pre&s;ent trade and bu&s;ine&s;s, without the help of paper.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> I mu&s;t al&s;o take leave to differ, in opinion, with tho&s;e, who, without enquiry, and by whole&s;ale, are plea&s;ed to condemn all &s;chemes of lending money, to be di&s;charged by annual pay|ments; for I truly think that method will not only &s;uit the different circum&s;tances and conveniency of
<PB N="167" REF="034421_0167_0FFD9F2CD39B3210">
the people be&s;t, but, in all re&s;pects, will prove the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t profitable, as well as equal; and my rea&s;ons for it, are the&s;e:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Whatever quantity be i&s;&s;ued, if one fifth, &s;ixth, or tenth part, of the &s;um, according to the time, for which it is to la&s;t, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily come into office every year, it may be lent out again, at <HI>five per cent.</HI> for any time, within the term, to &s;uch per&s;ons as had no place, or opportunity, to come into the fir&s;t loan: by which means all the frightful, odd things, mentioned in the gentle|men's &s;ixth ob&s;ervation, will pre&s;ently vani&s;h; for every man, in this ca&s;e, according to his ability, may, if he thinks fit, &s;hare in that advantage; which the public mo&s;t generou&s;ly and prudently offers to the nece&s;&s;ities of the people.</P>
<P N="2">2ndly, If &s;o great a &s;hare of the whole comes in yearly to the office, in order to be lent out again, it will, in a great mea&s;ure, prevent engro&s;&s;ing,
<PB N="168" REF="034421_0168_0FFD9F0F207130E8">
and help the circulation con&s;iderably; it will al&s;o give more frequent opportunity of di&s;covering frauds, and gradually increa&s;e the public &s;tock and revenue of the bank; and by that means it will demon&s;trably &s;ink the original &s;um, within the time prefixed; that is to &s;ay, the paper, at the end of that term, will either be found in the office, or its value in ca&s;h, ready to pay what &s;hall then happen, by accident, to be yet abroad.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> If too great a &s;ecurity is demanded for the loan of public money, I think, it will, in a great mea&s;ure, fru&s;trate the de&s;ign of relieving many of the middling, or mo&s;t indu&s;trious, &s;ort of the people; wherefore, it is my opinion, that
<PB N="169" REF="034421_0169_0FFD9EE9334C4F18">
one half of the value of ground rents may very &s;afely be lent to tho&s;e, who are willing and able to give &s;uch &s;ecurity.</P>

<P>That they, in an e&s;pecial manner, have a watchful eye and over&s;ight of their &s;everal members, that this great favour be not <HI>abu&s;ed,</HI> or <HI>mi&s;u&s;ed,</HI> by any profe&s;&s;ing truth with us.</P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, and Lawgiver, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> told his di&s;ciples, <HI>"Ye are the light of the world; a city, that is &s;et on a hill, cannot be hid."</HI> And in every age, as many as do walk in obedience to his go&s;pel, mu&s;t unavoidably be &s;o; <HI>the daily cro&s;s and &s;elf-denial,</HI> which he doth enjoin, (tho&s;e &s;ure tokens of a Chri&s;tian di&s;ciple) are public marks, which are ea&s;ily &s;een, and readily ob&s;erved, by tho&s;e, with whom we have occa&s;ion of bu&s;ine&s;s, or concern; and our tran&s;acting thereof with uprightne&s;s, ju&s;tice and moderation will &s;hew that we have an awful regard to our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> whom we acknowledge and declare to be our great Lawgiver and Example.</P>
<P>The great end and de&s;ign of the new covenant, <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>truth,</HI> which is come by him, is to draw men into obedience to his law, written in the heart; by which only the in&s;ide can be made clean; and accord|ing to the degrees of obedience to this divine law, which the apo&s;tle calls, <HI>The law of the &s;pirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> the proper effect thereof will appear; that is, <HI>the in&s;ide will be made clean al&s;o.</HI> Hereby <HI>truth, ju&s;tice, righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>charity</HI> will &s;hine forth in the words and actions of &s;uch; and then may be truly applied to them that &s;aying of <HI>Chri&s;t; a city, that is &s;et upon a hill, cannot be hid.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ide the inward engagements of this divine law, to &s;peak and act according to truth, there is, at this time, al&s;o an outward engagement, which the government hath laid upon us, not only by the favour of this act, but al&s;o by the manner, wherein they have conferred it: for, in the preamble, it is &s;aid; <HI>it is manife&s;t that the &s;aid people called Quakers, have not abu&s;ed the liberty and indulgence, allowed them by law.</HI> Which te&s;|timony of the Legi&s;lature concerning the u&s;e of the late <HI>&s;olemn affirmation,</HI> upon twenty-five years experience, ought, at lea&s;t, to &s;tir up all Friends to great watchfulne&s;s and care, in the u&s;e of this further ea&s;e and relief; that this te&s;timony may be continued, and thereby confirm the govern|ment in their favourable &s;entiments concerning us.</P>
<P>And as this &s;ignal indulgence may draw the eyes and ob&s;ervation of many people upon us, it may be expected, among the&s;e, &s;ome will look on us with an evil eye, watch for our halting, and &s;eek occa&s;ion again&s;t us, upon any mi&s;u&s;e, or abu&s;e, of this legal privilege, which any, pro|fe&s;&s;ing truth with us, or but bearing the name, &s;hould fall into, or com|mit.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, therefore, that there may be no mi&s;u&s;e of this favour, we do earne&s;tly de&s;ire and entreat, that the &s;everal meetings do advi&s;e and exhort <HI>Friends,</HI> that they watch again&s;t all vexatious and trifling cau&s;es of difference; and not, for any &s;uch cau&s;e, implead, or commence &s;uits of law, upon the encouragement of this <HI>&s;olemn affirmation,</HI> for that would certainly be a perverting the good de&s;ign of the government, in the granting thereof, and mu&s;t be deemed a great <HI>mi&s;u&s;e</HI> of this privilege.</P>
<P>Secondly, That there be no abu&s;es thereof committed, we do, in like manner, entreat and de&s;ire, that Friends may be exhorted and ad|vi&s;ed, when any ju&s;t and valuable occa&s;ion doth require any to make u&s;e of this <HI>affirmation,</HI> that &s;uch <HI>Friend,</HI> or <HI>Friends,</HI> be very con&s;iderate, and &s;ure of the truth of what they are about to <HI>affirm;</HI> for where property, or liberty are concerned, a fal&s;e or corrupt evidence in very injurious, and may prove de&s;tructive; be&s;ide, it ought, on all occa&s;ions, to be re|membered, that, <HI>a fal&s;e witne&s;s &s;hall not be unpuni&s;hed, and he that &s;peaketh lies &s;hall not e&s;cape;</HI> and that the command, <HI>thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s,</HI> is as well in the go&s;pel as in the law; and that <HI>all liars &s;hall have their part in the lake, which burneth with fire and brim&s;tone.</HI> To the&s;e inward obligations, on the con&s;cience, to truth-&s;peaking, there is al&s;o added the outward guard of pains, penalties and forfeitures, to be inflicted on &s;uch as &s;hall lawfully be convicted of wilful and corrupt perjury.</P>
<P>We cannot omit al&s;o to remind you, that &s;hould any, under our name, &s;o far depart from the righteous law of God, as herein to become guilty, they will thereby contract to them&s;elves perpetual infamy, and to the body, whereof they may pretend to be members, very great &s;can|dal and reproach; and &s;uch in&s;tances repeated might provoke the govern|ment to deprive us of this great benefit; how great would be the load of guilt on any, who &s;hould be the occa&s;ion thereof!</P>
<P>Let it be al&s;o con&s;idered, that the ground of our petitioning and &s;oliciting this further ca&s;e and relief, was a con&s;cientious &s;cruple, <HI>to &s;wear at all,</HI> at the &s;ame time to be guilty of <HI>fal&s;e affirming,</HI> and while they pre|tend to great degrees of purity, to fall &s;hort in common hone&s;ty! It is indeed among the highe&s;t degrees of hypocri&s;y, a crime abhorred by God and man! &amp;c.</P>

<P>Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI>'s royal grant of <HI>Maryland</HI> was about 50 years prior to Mr. <HI>Penn</HI>'s grant of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> but in <HI>Baltimore</HI>'s grant there was an exception of lands belonging to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which are, at pre&s;ent, the three lower counties upon <HI>Delaware</HI> river; when Mr. <HI>Penn</HI> took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, he found one <HI>Dutch</HI> and three <HI>Swedes</HI> congregations.</P>

<P>"Con&s;idering that <HI>Maryland</HI> grant was prior, and that the <HI>Maryland</HI> people had made con&s;iderable improvements by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, within that degree of latitude, the affair was compromi&s;ed &s;eemingly in favour of <HI>Maryland,</HI> by a written agreement, May 10th 1732, "and that, in two calendar months from that date, each party &s;hould appoint commi&s;&s;ioners, not more than &s;even, whereof three or more, of each &s;ide, may act, or mark out the boundaries afore&s;aid, to begin, at furthe&s;t, &s;ometime in October 1732, and to be completed on, or before, 25th December, 1733, and when &s;o done, a plan thereof &s;hall be &s;igned, &s;ealed and delivered by the commi&s;&s;ioners and their principals, and &s;hall be entered in all the public offices in the &s;everal provinces and counties; and to recommend, to the re&s;pective Legi&s;latures, to pa&s;s an act for perambulating the&s;e boun|daries, at lea&s;t once in three years.</P>

<P>"It is our great happine&s;s, that, in&s;tead of triennial A&s;&s;emblies, a privilege, which &s;everal other colonies have long endeavoured to obtain, ours are annual; and, for that rea&s;on, as well as others, le&s;s liable to be practi&s;ed upon, or cor|rupted, either with money or pre&s;ents.

I hope it will ever be the wi&s;dom of our A&s;|&s;emblies to create no great offices nor officers, nor indeed any officer at all, but what is really nece&s;|&s;ary for the &s;ervice of the country, and to be &s;ure to let the people, or their repre&s;entatives, have, at lea&s;t, a &s;hare in their nomination, or appoint|ment.

<P>"Nor are we le&s;s happy, in the enjoyment of a perfect freedom, as to religion.

<P>THUS far appears the manner of the ri&s;e, colo|nization, increa&s;e and happy e&s;tabli&s;hment of the flouri&s;hing province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> which, by means of the very remarkable indu&s;try, hone&s;ty, moderation, and good policy of the fir&s;t and early coloni&s;ts and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, from a wilderne&s;s, became as a fruitful field, and a very valuable and important addition to the Briti&s;h intere&s;t in <HI>America,</HI> without any expence to the parent country.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This being written about the year 1778 or 1779, in a time of great confu&s;ion, contention and uncertainty, in this part of <HI>America,</HI> alludes, in the conclu&s;ion, to a probable, or apparent future change, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>The enjoyment of that rational freedom of thinking, and religious wor&s;hip, with a ju&s;t and equal participation of natural and civil rights, which, in the populou&s;ne&s;s, and general polity of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;eemed to be either too much lo&s;t, or, at lea&s;t, too partially di&s;tributed, was the compact of &s;ettlement; and the re&s;toration and fruition of that peace and tranquillity, which the wickedne&s;s and folly of the human race had &s;o much bani&s;h|ed from the world, by the more effectual encou|ragement and promotion of primitive truth and &s;implicity, in the actions and manners of men, in a way, that &s;eemed be&s;t to tho&s;e concerned, and &s;o far as the &s;tate of human nature would ad|mit, were the chief views and motives to the un|dertaking.</P>
<P>That the&s;e were the real principles, upon which the con&s;titution and government of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> were primarily founded, it is &s;ufficiently known and manife&s;t, from the be&s;t documents, and con|firmed by a &s;eries of mo&s;t certain facts, as given, though defectively, in the preceding hi&s;tory, and

in the following view of the general &s;tate of the province, between the years 1760 and 1770: that its great and rapid increa&s;e, its happy and flou|ri&s;hing condition &s;ince, down to the pre&s;ent time, have been principally owing to the influence of the&s;e &s;ame principles, in degree &s;till prevailing, future time will further, and more fully demon|&s;trate, whenever the unhappy rever&s;e thereof &s;hall take place; which now &s;eems to be fa&s;t approach|ing: by who&s;e contrary effects will then &s;till more clearly appear, in contra&s;t, both the cau&s;e and means of the extraordinary, and &s;o long continued pro&s;perity, and unparalled felicity, for which this province has been long &s;o ju&s;tly famed, above all other countries, at lea&s;t, in <HI>America,</HI> if not in the whole world: a &s;tate, in &s;ome re&s;pect, &s;o nearly re&s;embling that of tho&s;e <HI>&s;aturnian</HI> times, in <HI>Italy,</HI> which, we are told formerly produced the <HI>golden age,</HI> and &s;o far actually realizing ancient fable, that to its inhabitants, perhaps, before any other people, on the &s;urface of the globe, might parti|cularly, and with great propriety, have been ap|plied the exclamation of the poet Virgil,
<Q>"Felices nimium &s;ua &s;i bona norint, Agricolee!"</Q>
as well as that of Milton, re&s;pecting the &s;tate of the fir&s;t parents of mankind,
<Q><L>&mdash;"and, O! yet happie&s;t, if ye &s;eek</L>
<L>No happier &s;tate, and know to know no more."</L></Q></P>
<P>But all things have their time; and both king|doms and empires, as well as &s;maller &s;tates, and particular per&s;ons, mu&s;t die; <HI>"finis ac ab origine pendet;"</HI> yet folly often &s;hortens their duration, as wi&s;dom and virtue prolong their more happy exi&s;tence: and we may plainly &s;ee men frequently and greedily embrace the former, for the latter, and with great zeal and confidence often pur&s;ue their own mi&s;ery, under a &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion of the contrary: for, as the human body, when in

its mo&s;t plethoric &s;tate, and in the greate&s;t appear|ance of health and vigour, is often then mo&s;t in danger, or neare&s;t a &s;udden change, &s;o the late and pre&s;ent extraordinary pro&s;perity, the increa|&s;ing, flouri&s;hing and happy &s;tate of this country, at pre&s;ent, above others, may probably be a prog|no&s;tic, or &s;ign, of its being in a more critical &s;itu|ation and danger.</P>
<P>For &s;o long as the fatal delu&s;ion, which, we are told, originally rendered mankind unhappy, &s;till continues, though in different degrees, and various appearances, to except entirely from its baneful influence no part of the human race, every con|dition, in this world, will be &s;ubject to muta|bility; but then the remedy has ever been equal to the di&s;ea&s;e; for the Creator and Supporter of the world, who&s;e peculiar attribute it is, to pro|duce good out of evil, has placed within the power and choice of mankind, tho&s;e means of recovery from all evil, which are, at lea&s;t, adequate to the nature and extent of it; and &s;ometimes places &s;pecial examples before the eyes of the human race, like this of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> to &s;hew them the ab&s;olute po&s;&s;ibility of a &s;till &s;uperior bli&s;s, and more exalted felicity, than is commonly experi|enced in the world, not only in an individual, but al&s;o in a collective, or national, and more univer&s;al capacity.</P>

<P>The export from Philadelphia in 1774, in grain, flour and bread alone, was computed to be equal to about 2,170,000 bu&s;hels; of which 140,000 bu&s;hels con&s;i&s;ted of <HI>Indian</HI> corn, the whole at five &s;hillings per bu&s;hel, amounts to &pound;. 542,500, in value; and if the quantity of flax&s;eed was equal to that of the next preceding year, it would make the whole value amount to above &pound;. 600,000, in the&s;e par|ticular articles alone, at a very moderate compu|tation.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="034421_0266_0FFD9FD1B9E00270"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gra&s;s lands, &amp;c.</NOTE>The gra&s;s lands in the fir&s;t &s;ettled, or old coun|ties, are but a &s;mall proportion, and are chiefly &s;ituated on the &s;ides of rivers, creeks and rivulets, or moi&s;t places, where, at times, they are partly overflowed, being mo&s;tly very rich, and produce abundance, but of a rapid growth. Of this kind are the large quantities of fine low meadows, near and about <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> which, being &s;ecured by banks from the tides and floods of the <HI>Delaware,</HI> and the creeks which run into it (by which they were formerly overflowed, and tendered u&s;ele&s;s) are of very great and extraordinary advantage to that city.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruits.</NOTE>Large orchards of <HI>apple-trees</HI> are propagated in almo&s;t every plantation; which every where pro|duce great quantities of fine, large, well flavoured fruit; and in &s;ome places <HI>peaches</HI> are &s;o common and plentiful, that the country people feed their hogs with them; likewi&s;e <HI>cherries,</HI> of various kinds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liquors,</NOTE> are no le&s;s abundant and good. But, though <HI>cyder</HI> is the common drink of this country, and very plentiful and ea&s;y to be procured, yet it is not made by the inhabitants to &s;uch perfection as it is capable of. Be&s;ides, <HI>Li&s;bon</HI> and <HI>Madeira</HI> wines, among the higher rank, and <HI>We&s;t India</HI> rum and &s;pirits are much drank, in mixture, by the people in general. And &s;ometimes a kind of weak beverage is u&s;ed, made of a mixture of mo|la&s;&s;es,

&amp;c. which is called mola&s;&s;es beer. Malt liquor, which among the fir&s;t &s;ettlers, was more common, is made in &s;ome of the principal towns, in &s;mall quantity. It has long been at times more or le&s;s an article of exportation from <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> And the u&s;e of tea, coffee and chocolate, &amp;c. is very common.</P>
<P>But the liquors of the native growth and pro|duce of the country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and provi|&s;ions, &amp;c.</NOTE> exclu&s;ive of what are im|ported from abroad, are, in general, but mean, or &s;carce and inferior, compared with the provi|&s;ions, which are good and plentiful. This &s;eems to ari&s;e, at lea&s;t, in part, from too much neglect in this particular, occa&s;ioned by getting <HI>rum</HI> and &s;pirits at &s;uch exceeding low rates from the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> which has rendered malt liquor, though more whole&s;ome, and profitable for the country, le&s;s u&s;ed than formerly, in the early time of the pro|vince, in proportion to the number of people, notwith&s;tanding it is &s;o great a grain country.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, though grapes grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly, in great variety and abundance, almo&s;t every where in the woods, &amp;c. being natural to the country, and laudable attempts have been made in making wine from them, yet not much has hitherto been done in it to very con&s;iderable advantage.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Uncertain|ty of the origin of the Indians, &amp;c.</NOTE>AS to the origin of the <HI>Indians,</HI> or aboriginal inhabitants of <HI>America,</HI> in general, there is no|thing on record, but mere modern conjecture; which varies according to the different opinions and fancies of tho&s;e, who have thought and writ on the &s;ubject, and endeavoured to account for the fir&s;t peopling of that continent. It is, per|haps, as improbable for a people, who have not the knowledge of letters, to derive their original from tho&s;e, who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary &s;cience, and not to retain it among them|&s;elves afterwards, as it would be nugatory to pre|tend to give an account thereof, without the means, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e?

Therefore we think it evident that our notion, concerning future rewards and puni&s;hments, was either revealed immediately from heaven, to &s;ome of our forefathers, and from them de&s;cended to us, or, that it was implanted in each of us, at our creation, by the Creator of all things.

<P>"In the next place, we beg that he would explain him&s;elf more par|ticularly concerning the <HI>revelation</HI> he talks of. If he admits no other, than what is contained in his <HI>written book,</HI> the contrary is evident, from what has been &s;hewn before: but, if he &s;ays, God has revealed him&s;elf to us, but not &s;ufficient for our &s;alvation; then, we a&s;k, to what purpo&s;e &s;hould he have revealed him&s;elf to us in any wi&s;e? It is clear, that a <HI>revelation,</HI> in&s;ufficient to &s;ave, cannot put us in a better condition, than we &s;hould be in, without any revelation at all. We cannot conceive that God &s;hould point out to us the end, we ought to aim at, without opening to us the way to arrive at that end. But, &s;uppo&s;ing our under|&s;tandings to be &s;o far illuminated, as to know it to be our duty to plea&s;e God, who yet hath left us under an incapacity of doing it, will this <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionary,</HI> therefore, conclude that we &s;hall be <HI>eternally damned?</HI> Will he take upon him to pronounce damnation again&s;t us, for not doing tho&s;e things, which he him&s;elf acknowledges were impo&s;&s;ible by us to be done?

Had the <HI>Al|mighty</HI> thought &s;o much knowledge nece&s;&s;ary to our &s;alvation, his good|ne&s;s would not long have deferred the communication of it to us; and to &s;ay, that, in a matter &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, he could not, at one and the &s;ame time, equally reveal him&s;elf to all mankind, is nothing le&s;s than an ab&s;o|lute denial of his omnipotence. Without doubt he can make his will manife&s;t, without the help of any <HI>book,</HI> or the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any <HI>booki&s;h man</HI> whatever.</P>
<P>"We &s;hall, in the next place, con&s;ider the arguments, which ari&s;e from a con&s;ideration of <HI>Providence.</HI> If we are the work of God, (which I pre&s;ume will not be denied) it follows from thence, that we are under the care and protection of God: for, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that the <HI>Deity</HI> &s;hould abandon his own creatures, and be utterly regardle&s;s of their welfare. Then, to &s;ay, that the <HI>Almighty</HI> hath permitted us to remain in a fatal error, through &s;o many ages, is to repre&s;ent him as a tyrant: how is it con&s;i&s;tent with his ju&s;tice, to force life upon a race of mortals, without their con&s;ent, and then <HI>damn them eternally,</HI> without ever opening to them a door of &s;alvation? Our conceptions of the <HI>gra|cious God</HI> are more noble; and we think that tho&s;e, who teach otherwi&s;e, do little le&s;s than <HI>bla&s;pheme.</HI> Again, it is through the care and goodne&s;s of the <HI>Almighty,</HI> that from the beginning of time, through many gene|rations, to this day, our name has been pre&s;erved, unblotted out by ene|mies, unreduced to nothing. By the &s;ame care we now enjoy our lives; are furni&s;hed with the nece&s;&s;ary means of pre&s;erving tho&s;e lives. But all the&s;e things are trifling, compared with our &s;alvation.</P>
<P>"Therefore, &s;ince God hath been &s;o careful of us, in matters of little con&s;equence, it would be ab&s;urd to affirm, that he has neglected us, in ca&s;es of the greate&s;t importance. Admit, that he hath for&s;aken us, yet it could not have been without a ju&s;t cau&s;e. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that an <HI>heinous crime</HI> was committed by one of our ance&s;tors, like to that, which we are told, happened among another race of people; in &s;uch ca&s;e, God would certainly puni&s;h the <HI>criminal,</HI> but would never involve us, who are innocent, in his guilt. Tho&s;e who think otherwi&s;e mu&s;t make the <HI>Almighty</HI> a very <HI>whim&s;ical, ill-natured being.</HI> Once more, are the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> more virtuous? or, rather, are they not more vicious, than we are? If &s;o, how came it to pa&s;s, that they are the objects of God's beneficence, while we are neglected? Does the Deity confer his favours without rea|&s;on, and with &s;o much partiality? in a word, we find the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> much more depraved, in their morals, than our&s;elves; and we judge of their doctrine by the <HI>badne&s;s of their lives."</HI></P></NOTE></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conrad Wei&s;er's letter re|&s;pecting it.</NOTE>I write this, in compliance with thy reque&s;t, to give thee an account of what I have ob&s;erved among the <HI>Indians,</HI> in relation to their belief and confidence in a <HI>Divine Being,</HI> according to the ob&s;ervations I have made, from 1714, in the time of my youth, to this day, (about the year 1746).</P>
<P>If, by the word <HI>religion,</HI> people mean an a&s;|&s;ent to certain creeds, or the ob&s;ervance of a &s;et of <HI>religious</HI> duties; as, appointed prayers, &s;ingings, preaching, bapti&s;m, &amp;c. or, even, <HI>Heatheni&s;h wor&s;hip,</HI> then it may be &s;aid, the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and their neighbours, have no <HI>religion.</HI> But, if, by <HI>religion,</HI> we mean an <HI>attraction</HI> of the &s;oul to God, whence proceeds a confidence in, and hunger af|ter, the knowledge of him, then this people mu&s;t be allowed to have &s;ome <HI>religion</HI> among them, not|with&s;tanding their &s;ometimes &s;avage deportment. For we find among them &s;ome tracts of a confi|dence in God alone; and, even, &s;ometimes, though but &s;eldom, a vocal calling upon him: I &s;hall give one or two in&s;tances of this, that fell under my own ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="034421_0317_0FFDA10106BABB88">In the year 1737, I was &s;ent, the fir&s;t time, to <HI>Onondago,</HI> at the de&s;ire of the Governor of <HI>Virginia.</HI> I departed in the latter end of February, very unexpectedly, for a journey of five hundred <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles, through a wilderne&s;s, where there was neither road nor path, and at &s;uch a time of the year, when creatures (animals) could not be met with, for food. There were with me a <HI>Dutch|man</HI> and three <HI>Indians.</HI> After we had gone one hundred and fifty miles on our journey, we came to a narrow valley, about half a mile broad, and thirty long; both &s;ides of which were encompa&s;|&s;ed with high mountains; on which the &s;now laid about three feet deep: in it ran a &s;tream of water, al&s;o about three feet deep; which was &s;o crooked, that it kept a continued winding cour&s;e from one &s;ide of the valley to the other. In order to avoid wading &s;o often through the water, we endea|voured to pa&s;s along on the &s;lope of the moun|tain; the &s;now being three feet deep, and &s;o hard frozen, on the top, that we could walk upon it: but we were obliged to make holes in the &s;now with our hatchets, that our feet might not &s;lip down the mountain; and thus we crept on. It happened that the <HI>old Indian</HI>'s foot &s;lipt; and the root of a tree, by which he held, breaking, he &s;lid down the mountain, as from the roof of a hou&s;e; but happily he was &s;topped in his fall, by the &s;tring, which fa&s;tened his pack, hitching on the &s;tump of a &s;mall tree. The other two <HI>Indians</HI> could not go to his aid, but our <HI>Dutch</HI> fellow-tra|veller did; yet not without vi&s;ible danger of his own life. I al&s;o could not put a foot forward, till I was helped; after this we took the fir&s;t oppor|tunity to de&s;cend into the valley; which was not till after we had laboured hard for half an hour with hands and feet. Having ob&s;erved a tree ly|ing directly off, from where the <HI>Indian</HI> fell, when we were got into the valley again, we went back
<PB N="318" REF="034421_0318_0FFDA0F1E91E5E00">
about one hundred paces, where we &s;aw, that if the <HI>Indian</HI> had &s;lipt four or five paces further, he would have fallen over a rock, one hundred feet perpendicular, upon craggy pieces of rocks below. The <HI>Indian</HI> was a&s;toni&s;hed, and turned quite pale; then with out-&s;tretched arms, and great earne&s;t|ne&s;s he &s;poke the&s;e words: <HI>"I thank the great Lord and Governor of this world, in that he has had mercy upon me, and has been willing that I &s;hould live longer."</HI> Which words I, at that time, put down in my journal: this happened on the 25th of March, 1737.</P>
<P>In the 9th of April following, while we were yet on our journey, I found my&s;elf extremely weak, through the fatigue of &s;o long a journey, with the cold and hunger, which I had &s;uffered; there having fallen a fre&s;h &s;now about twenty inches deep, and we being yet three days journey from <HI>Onondago,</HI> in a frightful wilderne&s;s; my &s;pirit failed, my bo|dy trembled and &s;hook; I thought I &s;hould fall down and die; I &s;tept a&s;ide, and &s;at down under a tree, expecting there to die. My companions &s;oon mi&s;&s;ed me; the <HI>Indians</HI> came back, and found me &s;itting there. They remained awhile &s;ilent; at la&s;t, the old <HI>Indian</HI> &s;aid, "My dear companion, thou ha&s;t hitherto encouraged us, wilt thou now quite give up? remember that evil days are better than good days: for when we &s;uffer much, we do not &s;in; &s;in will be driven out of us by &s;uffering: but good days cau&s;e men to &s;in; and God cannot extend his mercy to them; but contrarywi&s;e, when it goeth evil with us, God hath compa&s;&s;ion upon us." The&s;e words made me a&s;hamed; I ro&s;e up, and travelled as well as I could.</P>
<P>The next year I went another journey to <HI>Onondago,</HI> in company with <HI>Jo&s;eph Spanhenberg</HI> and two others. It happened that an <HI>Indian</HI> came to us in the evening, who had neither &s;hoes, &s;tock|ings,
<PB N="319" REF="034421_0319_0FFDA102898A4E78">
&s;hirt, gun, knife, nor hatchet; in a word, he had nothing but an old torn blanket, and &s;ome rags. Upon enquiring whither he was going, he an&s;wered to <HI>Onondago.</HI> I knew him, and a&s;ked him how he could undertake a journey of three hundred miles &s;o naked and unprovided, having no provi&s;ions, nor any arms, to kill creatures, for his &s;u&s;tenance? He an&s;wered, he had been among enemies, and had been obliged to &s;ave him&s;elf by flight; and &s;o had lo&s;t all. This was true, in part; for he had di&s;po&s;ed of &s;ome of his things among the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> for &s;trong liquors. Upon fur|ther talk, he told me very chearfully; "That <HI>God</HI> fed every thing, which had life, even, the rattle &s;nake it&s;elf, though it was a bad creature; and that <HI>God</HI> would al&s;o provide, in &s;uch a man|ner, that he &s;hould get alive to <HI>Onondago;</HI> he knew for certain that he &s;hould go thither; that it was vi&s;ible <HI>God</HI> was with the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the wilderne&s;s; becau&s;e they always ca&s;t their care upon him; but that, contrary to this, the Euro|peans always carried bread with them." He was an <HI>Onondago Indian;</HI> his name was <HI>Onontagketa;</HI> the next day we travelled in company; and the day following I provided him with a knife, hatchet, flint, and tinder, al&s;o &s;hoes and &s;tockings, and &s;ent him before me, to give notice to the council, at <HI>Onondago,</HI> that I was coming; which he truly performed, being got thither three days before us.</P>
<P>Two years ago I was &s;ent by the Governor to <HI>Shamokin,</HI> on account of the unhappy death of <HI>John Arm&s;trong,</HI> the <HI>Indian trader,</HI> (about 1744). After I had performed my errand, there was a fea&s;t pre|pared; to which the Governor's me&s;&s;engers were invited: there were about one hundred per&s;ons pre|&s;ent, to whom, after we had, in great &s;ilence, devour|ed a fat bear, the elde&s;t of the chiefs made a &s;peech, in which he &s;aid, "That, by a great misfortune, three of their brethren, the <HI>white men,</HI> had been
<PB N="320" REF="034421_0320_0FFDA0A215FAFBD0">
killed by an <HI>Indian;</HI> that neverthele&s;s the &s;un was not &s;et, (meaning there was no war); it had only been &s;omewhat darkened by a &s;mall cloud, which was now done away; he that had done evil was like to be puni&s;hed, and the land to remain in peace: therefore he exhorted his people to <HI>thank|fulne&s;s to God;</HI> and thereupon he began to &s;ing with an awful &s;olemnity, but without expre&s;&s;ing any words; the others accompanied him with their voices: after they had done, the &s;ame <HI>Indian,</HI> with great earne&s;tne&s;s, or fervour, &s;poke the&s;e words; <HI>"Thanks, thanks, be to thee, thou great Lord of the world, in that thou ha&s;t again cau&s;ed the &s;un to &s;hine, and ha&s;t di&s;per&s;ed the dark cloud; &mdash;the Indians are thine.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of &s;ome religi|ous Indians in 1760.</NOTE>One more in&s;tance may be mentioned on this &s;ubject, which has come under my own ob&s;erva|tion and per&s;onal knowledge. In the &s;ummer of the year 1760, a number of <HI>religious Indians</HI> paid a vi&s;it to the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> on a religi|ous account. They were mo&s;tly of the <HI>Minu&s;ing</HI> tribe, and came from a town called <HI>Mahackloo&s;ing,</HI> or <HI>Wyalu&s;ing,</HI> on, or near the ea&s;t branch of <HI>Su&s;|quahanna</HI> river, in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> about two hun|dred miles north we&s;tward from the city. Their chief man, whom the re&s;t of the company &s;tyled their mini&s;ter, was named <HI>Papunehung,</HI> or <HI>Papou|nan;</HI> and their interpreter, <HI>Job Chillaway,</HI> an <HI>In|dian.</HI></P>
<P>On their arrival, they waited on Governor <HI>Ha|milton,</HI> to pay him their re&s;pects, and to deliver three pri&s;oners, whom they had redeemed; hav|ing them&s;elves ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to join with the other <HI>Indians,</HI> in the &s;avage war, which raged about that time; though their vi&s;it was principally on a different account.</P>
<P>They had a public conference with the Govern|or, in the &s;tate-hou&s;e, on the occa&s;ion, in the
<PB N="321" REF="034421_0321_0FFDA0C96BA6D1E8">
pre&s;ence of many citizens; wherein <HI>Papounan</HI> ex|pre&s;&s;ed the de&s;ign of their vi&s;it was principally to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> on a religious account; that they de&s;ired to do ju&s;tice, to love God, and to live in peace; reque&s;ting, at the &s;ame time, that none of his company &s;hould be permitted to have any &s;pirituous liquors, &amp;c. He refu&s;ed the pre&s;ents, offer|ed by the Governor, and gave him the rea&s;ons; further &s;aying: "I think on God, who made us; I want to be in&s;tructed in his wor&s;hip and &s;ervice; I am a great lover of peace, and have never been concerned in war affairs; I have a &s;incere remem|brance of the <HI>old friend&s;hip</HI> between the <HI>Indians</HI> and your <HI>forefathers,</HI> and &s;hall ever ob&s;erve it." After mentioning &s;ome other things, and expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf further on the view, or de&s;ign, of their vi|&s;it, on a religious account, he &s;aid, "Though what he had mentioned re&s;pecting religious affairs might appear trivial to &s;ome, who thought differ|ent from him, yet he was fixed in his mind re|&s;pecting them; that their young men agreed with him, and wanted to love God, and to de&s;i&s;t from their former bad cour&s;e of life;" further declaring, "I am glad I have an opportunity of mentioning the&s;e &s;everal affairs in the pre&s;ence of &s;uch a large auditory of young and old people; the great God ob&s;erves all that pa&s;&s;es in our hearts, and hears all that we &s;ay one to another," &amp;c. The notes, &amp;c. on the occa&s;ion, were taken from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nter|preter by Secretary <HI>Peters.</HI></P>
<P>He then fini&s;hed with a &s;olemn act of public thank&s;giving and prayer to God, with great devo|tion and energy, in the <HI>Indian language</HI> (not being able to &s;peak nor under&s;tand <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>). The un|u&s;ualne&s;s, force and &s;ound of the <HI>Indian language,</HI> on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, with the manife&s;t great &s;in|cerity, fervour and concern of the &s;peaker, &s;eemed to &s;trike the whole auditory in an uncommon manner, as well as the <HI>Indians</HI> them&s;elves; who,
<PB N="322" REF="034421_0322_0FFDA12685B49240">
all the while, behaved with a gravity and deport|ment becoming the occa&s;ion, and appeared to unite heartily with him, in his devotion.</P>
<P>They were kindly treated by the Governor, and remained in town afterwards &s;everal days, vi&s;iting and conferring with divers of the <HI>Friends,</HI> or <HI>Qua|kers,</HI> and attending their religious meetings, while they &s;taid; who behaved towards them in a kind, ho&s;pitable and friendly manner. They repeatedly expre&s;&s;ed their great di&s;like and abhorrence of war, as ari&s;ing from a bad &s;pirit, admiring that the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> were &s;uch great warriors, rather than lovers and cultivators of peace, &amp;c. They kept them&s;elves entirely from &s;trong liquor, and uniformly ob&s;erved a &s;ober, orderly and commend|able behaviour, often expre&s;&s;ing their &s;atisfaction with what they heard from the Friends.</P>
<P>From the account, they gave of them&s;elves, they had been of this mind for &s;everal years be|fore this time; and, as far as appeared, and was under&s;tood by tho&s;e they vi&s;ited, principally from an immediate &s;en&s;e of divine goodne&s;s, manife&s;ted in their minds, without any in&s;trumental means, preaching, or information from other per&s;ons; yet, it was but lately, that in a more e&s;pecial manner they had been thus di&s;po&s;ed, and that <HI>Pa|pounan</HI> had been induced to preach among them; in which &s;ervice he was afterwards joined by two or three other Indians. They appeared very earne&s;t and &s;incere in promoting true piety; which they re|pre&s;ented, according to their apprehen&s;ion of it, to be the effect of an internal operation of the di|vine influence on the mind; whereby it became changed from a bad to a good &s;tate: this they em|phatically expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>the heart becoming &s;oft, and filled with good,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

was formerly a drunken man; but the death of his father bringing &s;orrow over his mind, he fell into a thoughtful, melancholic &s;tate; in which his eyes were turned to behold the earth, and con&s;ider the things which are thereon; from &s;eeing the folly and wickedne&s;s, which prevailed, his &s;orrow increa&s;ed; and it was given him to believe, there was a great power, which had created all the&s;e things. Upon which his mind was turned from beholding this lower world, to look towards him, who had created it; and &s;trong de&s;ires were rai&s;ed in his heart after the further knowledge of his <HI>Creator:</HI> neverthele&s;s the <HI>Almighty</HI> was not yet plea&s;ed to be found, or known, by him. But his de&s;ires increa&s;ing, he for&s;ook the town, and went into the woods, in great bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit. He was mi&s;&s;ed by the other <HI>Indians,</HI> who feared &s;ome ca&s;ualty might have happened to him, but after &s;earching for him, he was not found. At the end of five days it plea&s;ed God to appear to him, to his comfort; and to give him a &s;ight not only of his own inward &s;tate, but al&s;o an acquaint|ance, or knowledge, into the works of nature: &s;o that he apprehended a &s;en&s;e was given him of the virtues and natures of &s;everal herbs, roots, plants, trees, with the different relation they had one to another; and he was made &s;en&s;ible that man &s;tood in the neare&s;t relation to God, of any part of the creation. It was at this time that he was more particularly made &s;en&s;ible of his duty to God. He came home rejoicing, and endeavoured to put in practice what he apprehended was required of him," &amp;c.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> made a &s;econd vi&s;it to the <HI>Qua|kers</HI> in the next following &s;ummer, on the &s;ame account, and behaved in the &s;ame regular and be|coming manner as before. They maintained an orderly public wor&s;hip, in their way, at &s;tated times: at &s;ome of which they were vi&s;ited by &s;everal
<PB N="324" REF="034421_0324_0FFDA0C7ABF422E0">
of the Friends. <HI>Papunehung,</HI> their chief preacher, in his di&s;cour&s;es, at &s;uch times, principally ad|vi&s;ed and exhorted them to circum&s;pection, and brotherly love, in their conduct; that it might be manife&s;t they retained a true &s;en&s;e of their Crea|tor's goodne&s;s and favour continued to them; and in his public prayers and addre&s;&s;es to his Maker, he acknowledged, and returned thanks for, his mercy, in &s;till affording them a &s;en&s;e of his com|pa&s;&s;ion and loving kindne&s;s, reque&s;ting a continu|ance and increa&s;e thereof; that they might jointly know, in the end, a place of re&s;t, where love would prevail and have the dominion. When they were not di&s;per&s;ed, as in their hunting &s;ea&s;on, it appeared, they con&s;tantly met in this manner, in the morning, before &s;un-ri&s;e, and in the even|ing, after &s;un-&s;et.</P>
<P>The purport of more of Papunehung's expre&s;|&s;ions was, "That it was an affair of much &s;or|row to him, that men &s;hould make &s;o bad u&s;e of the breath of life, which God had breathed into them; and which ought continually to be im|proved to his honour, and the mutual benefit of mankind; that it was not well to &s;peak of things, which related to the <HI>Almighty,</HI> only from the root of the tongue; (meaning, in a &s;uperfi|cial, or in&s;en&s;ible, manner) but, in order that &s;uch words &s;hould be good, they mu&s;t proceed from the good principle in the heart; that he had, for many years, felt the good &s;pirit in his heart; but, wanting to try and prove it, in order to come to &s;ome certainty, he remained in an un&s;ettled &s;tate, till about four years ago, when he received an a&s;&s;urance, that this love was good, and that he needed no further enquiry about it; and being pa&s;t all doubt, that this was the right way, he had endeavoured to walk &s;teadily therein &s;ince that time; this &s;pirit was a &s;pirit of love; and that it was his daily prayer, that it might continu|ally

<P>With hands imbrued in innocent blood, and taking courage from their unoppo&s;ed &s;ucce&s;s and cruelty, the in&s;urgents now greatly increa&s;ed in number, and proceeded towards <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> with avowed intention to cut off a party of inno|cent and friendly <HI>Indians</HI> there; con&s;i&s;ting of tho&s;e of <HI>Wyalu&s;ing,</HI> before mentioned, and &s;ome others; who had thrown them&s;elves under the protection of the government, to the number of about one hundred and forty.

in all probability, they would have effected their bloody purpo&s;e, had they not met with &s;uch a pro|per and vigorous oppo&s;ition from the government, and the inhabitants of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> as they &s;eem|ed not to expect; which put a &s;top to their career.

<P>But, as wi&s;dom is better than &s;trength, and the cau&s;e above the effect, &s;o the power of rea&s;on and per&s;ua&s;ion alone, on the intelligent and rational mind, is the mo&s;t adequate and proper to rectify the erroneous, or le&s;s informed under&s;tanding, in objects entirely of a mental or intellectual na|ture; in which a difference of thinking may not be incon&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on and truth; for perhaps,

as light and knowledge increa&s;e and advance among mankind, the greater will be the variety of &s;entiment?

<L>Fir&s;t, <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI>'s memorable name,</L>

<L>Sprung from a worthy and illu&s;trious race,</L>
<L>But more en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">bled by his virtuous ways.</L>
<L>High in e&s;teem among the great he &s;tood;</L>
<L>His wi&s;dom made him lovely, great and good.</L>
<L>Tho' he be &s;aid to die, he will &s;urvive;</L>
<L>Thro' future time his memory &s;hall live:</L>
<L>This wi&s;e <HI>Proprietor,</HI> in love and prai&s;e,</L>
<L>Shall grow and flouri&s;h to the end of days.</L>
<L>With ju&s;t <HI>propriety,</HI> to future fame,</L>
<L>Fair <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> &s;hall record his name.</L>
<L>This, <HI>Charles the Second</HI> did, at fir&s;t command,</L>
<L>And for his father's merits gave the land:</L>
<L>But his high virtue did its value rai&s;e</L>
<L>To future glory, and to la&s;ting prai&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beneath the temp'rate zone the country lies,</L>
<L>And heat and cold with grateful change &s;upplies.</L>
<L>To fifteen hours extends the longe&s;t day,</L>
<L>When &s;ol in cancer points his fervid ray:</L>
<L>Yet here the winter &s;ea&s;on is &s;evere;</L>
<L>And &s;ummer's heat is difficult to bear.</L>
<L>But we&s;tern winds oft cool the &s;corching ray,</L>
<L>And &s;outhern breezes warm the winter's day.</L>
<L>Yet oft, tho' warm and fair the day begun,</L>
<L>Cold &s;torms ari&s;e before the &s;etting &s;un:</L>
<L>Nay, oft &s;o quick the change, &s;o great its pow'r,</L>
<L>As &s;ummer's heat, and winter, in an hour!</L>
<L>So violent the wind, that oft the ground</L>
<L>With rooted trees is cover'd wide and round.</L>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The frame of the government of the province of <HI>Pen&s;ilvania,</HI> in <HI>America:</HI> together with certain <HI>laws</HI> agreed upon in <HI>England,</HI> by the Governor and divers freemen of the afore&s;aid province.

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="preface">
<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the great and wi&s;e <HI>God</HI> had made the world, of all his creatures, it plea&s;ed him to chu&s;e man his Deputy to rule it: and to &s;it him for &s;o great a charge and tru&s;t, he did not only qualify him with &s;kill and power, but with integrity to u&s;e them ju&s;tly. This native goodne&s;s was equally his honour and his hap|pine&s;s; and whil&s;t he &s;tood here, all went well; there was no need of coercive or compul&s;ive means; the precept of divine love
<PB N="6" REF="034421_0379_0FFEA8A3C2DA87A0">
and truth, in his bo&s;om, was the guide and keeper of his innocency. But lu&s;t prevailing again&s;t duty, made a lamentable breach upon it; and the law, that before had no power over him, took place upon him, and his di&s;obedient po&s;terity, that &s;uch as would not live conformable to the holy law within, &s;hould fall under the reproof and correction of the ju&s;t law without, in a judicial ad|mini&s;tration.</P>
<P>This the Apo&s;tle teaches in divers of his epi&s;tles: "The law (&s;ays he) was added becau&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion:" In another place, "Knowing that the law was not made for the righteous man; but for the di&s;obedient and ungodly, for &s;inners, for unholy and prophane, for murderers, for whoremongers, for them that defile them&s;elves with mankind, and for man&s;tealers, for lyers, for per|jured per&s;ons," &amp;c. but this is not all, he opens and carries the matter of government a little further: "Let every &s;oul be &s;ub|ject to the higher powers; for there is no power but of <HI>God.</HI> The powers that be are ordained of <HI>God:</HI> who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of <HI>God.</HI> For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil; wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou &s;halt have prai&s;e of the &s;ame." "He is the mini&s;ter of God to thee for good." "Wherefore ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for wrath, but for con&s;cience &s;ake."</P>
<P>This &s;ettles the divine right of government beyond exception, and that for two ends: fir&s;t, to terrify evil doers; &s;econdly, to cheri&s;h tho&s;e that do well; which gives government a life beyond corruption, and makes it as durable in the world, as good men &s;hould be. So that government &s;eems to me a part of religion it|&s;elf, a thing &s;acred in its in&s;titution and end. For, if it does not directly remove the cau&s;e, it cru&s;hes the effects of evil, and is as &s;uch, (though a lower, yet) an emanation of the &s;ame Divine Pow|er, that is both author and object of pure religion; the difference lying here, that the one is more free and mental, the other more corporal and compul&s;ive in its operations: but that is only to evil doers; government it&s;elf being otherwi&s;e as capable of kindne&s;s, goodne&s;s and charity, as a more private &s;ociety. They weakly err, that think there is no other u&s;e of government, than correc|tion, which is the coar&s;e&s;t part of it: daily experience tells us, that the care and regulation of many other affairs, more &s;oft, and daily nece&s;&s;ary, make up much the greate&s;t part of government; and which mu&s;t have followed the peopling of the world, had Adam never fell, and will continue among men, on earth, under the highe&s;t attainments they may arrive at, by the coming of the
<PB N="7" REF="034421_0380_0FFDA0B5AB93F9B0">
ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Second Adam,</HI> the <HI>Lord,</HI> from heaven. Thus much of go|vernment in general, as to its ri&s;e and end.</P>
<P>For particular <HI>frames</HI> and <HI>models,</HI> it will become me to &s;ay little; and comparatively I will &s;ay nothing. My rea&s;ons are:&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the age is too nice and difficult for it; there being nothing the wits of men are more bu&s;y and divided upon. It is true, they &s;eem to agree to the end, to wit, happine&s;s; but, in the means, they differ, as to divine, &s;o to this human felicity; and the cau&s;e is much the &s;ame, not always want of light and knowledge, but want of u&s;ing them rightly. Men &s;ide with their pa&s;&s;ions again&s;t their rea&s;on, and their &s;ini&s;ter intere&s;ts have &s;o &s;trong a bias upon their minds, that they lean to them again&s;t the good of the things they know.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I do not find a model in the world, that time, place, and &s;ome &s;ingular emergences have not nece&s;&s;arily altered; nor is it ea&s;y to frame a civil government, that &s;hall &s;erve all places alike.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I know what is &s;aid by the &s;everal admirers of <HI>monar|chy, ari&s;tocracy</HI> and <HI>democracy,</HI> which are the rule of one, a few, and many, and are the three common ideas of government, when men di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ubject. But I chu&s;e to &s;olve the controver&s;y with this &s;mall di&s;tinction, and it belongs to all three: <HI>Any govern|ment is free to the people under it</HI> (whatever be the frame) <HI>where the laws rule, and the people are a party to tho&s;e laws,</HI> and more than this is tyranny, oligarchy, or confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But, la&s;tly, when all is &s;aid, there is hardly one frame of go|vernment in the world &s;o ill de&s;igned by its fir&s;t founders, that, in good hands, would not do well enough; and &s;tory tells us, the be&s;t, in ill ones, can do nothing that is great or good; witne&s;s the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> &s;tates. Governments, like clocks, go from the motion men give them; and as governments are made and moved by men, &s;o by them they are ruined too. Wherefore go|vernments rather depend upon men, than men upon governments. Let men be good, and the government cannot be bad; if it be ill, they will cure it. But, if men be bad, let the government be never &s;o good, they will endeavour to warp and &s;poil it to their turn.</P>
<P>I know &s;ome &s;ay, let us have good laws, and no matter for the men that execute them: but let them con&s;ider, that though good laws do well, good men do better: for good laws may want good men, and be aboli&s;hed or evaded by ill men; but good men will never want good laws, nor &s;uffer ill ones. It is true, good laws have &s;ome awe upon ill mini&s;ters, but that is where they have not power to e&s;cape or aboli&s;h them, and the people are generally wi&s;e and
<PB N="8" REF="034421_0381_0FFEA8A7497518C8">
good: but a loo&s;e and depraved people (which is to the que&s;tion) love laws and an admini&s;tration like them&s;elves. That, therefore, which makes a good con&s;titution, mu&s;t keep it, <HI>viz.</HI> men of wi&s;|dom and virtue, qualities, that becau&s;e they de&s;cend not with worldly inheritances, mu&s;t be carefully propagated by a virtuous education of youth; for which after ages will owe more to the care and prudence of founders, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive magi&s;tracy, than to their parents, for their private patrimonies.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations of the weight of government, and the nice and various opinions about it, made it unea&s;y to me to think of publi&s;hing the en&s;uing frame and conditional laws, fore&s;eeing both the cen&s;ures, they will meet with, from men of differing humours and engagements, and the occa&s;ion they may give of di&s;|cour&s;e beyond my de&s;ign.</P>
<P>But, next to the power of nece&s;&s;ity, (which is a &s;olicitor, that will take no denial) this induced me to a compliance, that we have (with reverence to God, and good con&s;cience to men) to the be&s;t of our &s;kill, contrived and compo&s;ed the <HI>frame</HI> and <HI>laws</HI> of this government, to the great end of all government, viz. <HI>To &s;upport power in reverence with the people, and to &s;ecure the people from the abu&s;e of power;</HI> that they may be free by their ju&s;t obedience, and the magi&s;trates honourable, for their ju&s;t admini&s;tration: for liberty without obedience is confu&s;ion, and obedience without liberty is &s;lavery. To carry this evenne&s;s is partly owing to the con&s;titution, and partly to the magi&s;tracy: where either of the&s;e fail, govern|ment will be &s;ubject to convul&s;ions; but where both are wanting, it mu&s;t be totally &s;ubverted: then where both meet, the government is like to endure. Which I humbly pray and hope <HI>God</HI> will plea&s;e to make the lot of this of <HI>Pen&s;ilvania.</HI> Amen.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e the Governor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE, the repre&s;entatives of the freemen of the province and territories, in A&s;&s;embly met, having taken into &s;erious con&s;idera|tion &s;ome articles concerning our privileges in property, incited by an addre&s;s to this hou&s;e from the inhabitants of this place, and encouraged by thy&s;elf, in &s;etting forth thy care of us, and pro|mi&s;es of compliance therewith, do humbly offer the following heads for confirmation, reque&s;ting they may be granted the peo|ple of the province and territories, and a&s;certained to them in a charter.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Imprimis,</HI> That, in ca&s;e the Proprietary go for <HI>England,</HI> due care be taken that he be repre&s;ented here by per&s;ons of integrity, and con&s;iderable known e&s;tates, who may have full power and authority, not only to grant and confirm lands, &amp;c. as if he were per&s;onally pre&s;ent, but al&s;o to make &s;atisfaction to tho&s;e who have &s;hort, as well as receive what may be due from tho&s;e who have too much over mea&s;ure, according to former agreement.</P>
<P N="2">II. That before the Proprietary go for <HI>England,</HI> he grant us &s;uch an in&s;trument as may ab&s;olutely &s;ecure and defend us in our e&s;tates and properties, from him&s;elf, his heirs and a&s;&s;igns, for ever, or any claiming under him, them, or any of them, as al&s;o to clear all <HI>Indian</HI> purcha&s;es and others.</P>
<P N="3">III. That, whereas there hath been great delay in the confirm|ation of land, and granting of patents, due care may be taken by the Proprietary, that no &s;uch delays may be for the future; and that the ten acres in the hundred may be allowed, according to the Proprietary's engagements.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That no Surveyor, Secretary, or any other officer under the Proprietary, pre&s;ume to exact or take any fees, but what were, are, or &s;hall be allowed by the laws of this province, under &s;evere penalties.</P>
<P N="5">V. That no per&s;on, or per&s;ons, &s;hall, or may, at any time hereafter, be liable to an&s;wer any complaint, matter or thing what|&s;oever, relating to property, before the Governor, or his Council, or in any other place, but in the ordinary courts of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="41" REF="034421_0414_0FFDA19159B86190">VI. That the ancient records made before the Proprietary's fir&s;t arrival here, be lodged in &s;uch hands as the A&s;&s;embly &s;hall judge to be mo&s;t fit.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That a patent office, and all actual Surveyors thereby em|ployed, may be modelled according to the law of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and &s;uch &s;ecurity taken, as may render the people's intere&s;t &s;afe.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. That, whereas the Proprietary formerly gave the pur|cha&s;ers an expectation of a certain tract of land, which is &s;ince laid out, about two miles long, and one mile broad, whereon to build the town of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and that the &s;ame &s;hould be a free gift; which &s;ince has been clogged with divers rents and re&s;erva|tions contrary to the fir&s;t de&s;ign and grant, and to the great di&s;&s;a|tisfaction of the inhabitants: we de&s;ire the Governor to take it into con&s;ideration, and make them ea&s;y therein.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That the land, lying back of that part of the town already built, remain for common, and that no lea&s;es for the future, to make inclo&s;ures to the damage of the public, until &s;uch time as the re&s;pective owners &s;hall be ready to build or improve thereon; and that the i&s;lands and flats near the town, be left to the inhabi|tants of this town to get their winter fodder.</P>
<P N="10">X. That the &s;treets of the town be regulated and bounded, and that the ends of the &s;treets on <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Sculkil</HI> be unlimited, and left free to be extended on the river as the inhabitants &s;hall &s;ee meet; and that public landing places at the <HI>Blue Anchor</HI> and <HI>Penny Pot</HI> hou&s;e be confirmed free to the inhabitants of this town, not infringing any man's property.</P>
<P N="11">XI. That the Ju&s;tices may have the licen&s;ing and regulating or|dinaries and drinking hou&s;es, as in <HI>England;</HI> and as by thy letter, dated November 5, 1697, did order.</P>
<P N="12">XII. That the letters of feoffment for the &s;oil of the three lower counties, from the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> be recorded in the terri|tories.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. That all lands, in the &s;aid counties not yet taken up, may be di&s;po&s;ed of at the old rent, of a bu&s;hel of wheat a hun|dred.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. That the thou&s;and acres of land, formerly promi&s;ed by the Governor to the town of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> for common, be laid out and patented for that u&s;e.</P>
<P N="15">XV. That the bank lots at <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> be granted to tho&s;e that have the front lots, to low-water mark; or &s;o far as they may im|prove, at a bu&s;hel of wheat a lot.</P>
<P N="16"><PB N="42" REF="034421_0415_0FFDA219BA590AD0">XVI. That all the bay mar&s;hes be laid out for common, except &s;uch as are already granted.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. That all patents hereafter to be granted to the territories, be on the &s;ame conditions, as the warrants or grants were obtained.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. That the divi&s;ion lines between the counties of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> and <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> be a&s;certained, allowing the bounds according to the Proprietary's letters patent from the king.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. That the twenty-&s;econd article in the old charter, con|cerning fi&s;hing and fowling, be confirmed.</P>
<P N="20">XX. That the inhabitants or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of land may have liberty to purcha&s;e off their quit-rents, as formerly promi&s;ed.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. That the bill of property pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> 1700, be in|&s;erted in the charter, with &s;uch amendments as &s;hall be agreed on.</P>

<HEAD>The an&s;wer of the Proprietary and Governor to the preceding addre&s;s of the A&s;&s;embly, head by head.</HEAD>
<P>To the fir&s;t I &s;hall appoint tho&s;e, in whom I can confide, who&s;e powers &s;hall be &s;ufficient and public for the &s;ecurity of all con|cerned; and I hope they &s;hall be of hone&s;t character, without ju&s;t exception, to do that which is right between you and me.</P>
<P N="2">II. Much of it is included in my an&s;wer to the fir&s;t; however, I am willing to execute a public in&s;trument, or charter to &s;ecure you in your properties, according to purcha&s;e, and the law of property made lately at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> excepting &s;ome corrections, or amendments, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, therein.</P>
<P N="3">III. I know of no wilful delays, and &s;hall u&s;e my endeavours to prevent any for the future, and am very willing to allow the ten acres per cent. for the ends propo&s;ed by the law, and not otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I am willing that rea&s;onable fees to officers &s;hall be a&s;cer|tained by law, or their &s;ervices left to a <HI>quantum meruit;</HI> for I hope you do not think they &s;hould be maintained at my charge.</P>
<P N="5">V. I know of no per&s;on, that has been obliged to an&s;wer be|fore the Governor and Council, in &s;uch ca&s;es; but I conceive that di&s;putes about unconfined properties mu&s;t lie before the Pro|prietary, though not before his Council, as judges.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The records concern me, as well as the people, and are, or &s;hall be, in the hands of men of good fame, and to keep them only during good behaviour; but tho&s;e of this county of <HI>Phila|delphia,</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="034421_0416_0FFDA1C6ED0AA7A8">
that chiefly concern the people, are in &s;o great di&s;order, by razures, blots and interlineations, that you would do well to u&s;e &s;ome method in time, for their rectification.</P>
<P N="7">VII. If the <HI>Jamaica</HI> law will improve our regulation, as it doth augment the fees, I am content we copy after it.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. You are under a mi&s;take, in fact; I have tied you to no|thing, in the allotment of the city, which the fir&s;t purcha&s;ers, then pre&s;ent, did not readily &s;eem to comply with, and I am &s;orry to find their names to &s;uch an addre&s;s, as that pre&s;ented to you, who have got double lots, by my re-aplotment of the city, from fifty to one hundred and two feet front lots; and if they are willing to refund the fifty-two feet, I &s;hall, as you de&s;ire, be ea&s;y in the quit-rents, although this matter &s;olely refers to the fir&s;t purcha&s;ers, and to me as Proprietary.</P>
<P N="9">IX. You are under a mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, to think that a fourth part of the land, laid out for a city, belongs to any body but my|&s;elf, it being re&s;erved for &s;uch as were not fir&s;t purcha&s;ers, who might want to build in future time; and when I reflect upon the great abu&s;e, done in my ab&s;ence, by de&s;troying of my timber and wood, and how the land is over-run with bru&s;h, to the injury and di&s;credit of the town, it is &s;mall encouragement to grant your re|que&s;t; however, I am content that &s;ome land be laid out for the ac|commodation of the town, till inhabitants pre&s;ent to &s;ettle it under regulations that &s;hall be thought mo&s;t conducing to the end de|&s;ired, about which, I &s;hall con&s;ult with tho&s;e per&s;ons chiefly con|cerned therein; and for the re&s;t of the ninth article, about the i&s;lands, I know not which you mean, nor on what terms de&s;ired, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> being an independant property from the town, if not from the province.</P>
<P N="10">X. About the ends of &s;treets, and other public landings of this town, I am willing to grant the ends of &s;treets, when and where improved, and the other according to your reque&s;t.</P>
<P N="11">XI. I am contented that no licences be granted to any ordinary keepers, but &s;uch as the Ju&s;tices &s;hall recommend, nor &s;uffer them longer, than the Magi&s;trates find they behave well.</P>
<P N="12">XII. I do not under&s;tand it; for I had no letters of feoffment, but deeds, which were recorded by <HI>Ephraim Harman,</HI> at <HI>Newca&s;|tle,</HI> and by <HI>John We&s;t,</HI> to the be&s;t of my memory, at <HI>New York,</HI> and &s;ince confirmed by the order of Council, for the line, as well as otherwi&s;e, and a mo&s;t formal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and obedience given me in pur&s;uance thereof.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="44" REF="034421_0417_0FFDA1BDB212B5D8">XIII. I think this an unrea&s;onable article, either to limit me in that which is my own, or to deprive me of the benefit of rai&s;ing in proportion to the advantage, which time gives to other men's properties; and the rather, becau&s;e I am yet in di&s;bur&s;e for that long and expen&s;ive controver&s;y with the Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> promi&s;ed to be defrayed by the public, as appears by the minutes of Council.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. I allow it, according to what I lately expre&s;&s;ed at <HI>New|ca&s;tle,</HI> and it is not my fault it has not been done &s;ooner.</P>
<P N="15">XV. According to their own propo&s;als, at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> I &s;hall gratify their de&s;ire, <HI>viz.</HI> that the &s;ame revert to me, after a cer|tain time, if not improved.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. This I take for a high impo&s;ition; however, I am willing that they all lye in common and free, until otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of, and &s;hall grant the &s;ame from time to time, in rea&s;onable portions, and upon rea&s;onable terms, e&s;pecially to &s;uch as &s;hall engage to drain and improve the &s;ame; having always a regard to back in|habitants, for their accommodations.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. I cannot well under&s;tand it; therefore it mu&s;t be ex|plained.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. It is my own inclination, and I de&s;ire and expect the repre&s;entatives of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> and Che&s;ter forthwith, or before they leave the town, to attend me about the time and method of do|ing it.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. They &s;hall have liberty to fi&s;h, fowl and hunt, upon their own lands, and upon all other lands that are mine untaken up.</P>
<P N="20">XX. If it &s;hould be my lot to lo&s;e a public &s;upport, I mu&s;t de|pend upon my rents for a &s;upply; and therefore mu&s;t not ea&s;ily part with them; and many years are elap&s;ed &s;ince I made that offer, that was not excepted.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. I agree that the law of property, made at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> &s;hall be in&s;erted in the charter, with requi&s;ite amendments.</P>

<P>The <HI>Addre&s;s</HI> of the Tru&s;tees and Trea&s;urer of the <HI>Friendly A&s;&s;o|ciation,</HI> for regaining and pre&s;erving peace with the <HI>Indians</HI> by pacific mea&s;ures,</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER>Re&s;pectfully &s;heweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT on con&s;ideration of the an&s;wer given by the Governor to our offer of contributing towards the expence of the en&s;uing treaty with the <HI>Indians,</HI> we apprehend it to be nece&s;&s;ary to lay be|fore him a true &s;tate of the motives, which induced us to u&s;e our endeavours to promote a reconciliation with them; of the manner, in which we proceeded before and &s;ince the Governor's arrival in this province, and of &s;ome rea&s;ons we have for de&s;iring to &s;ee that the grounds of their complaints are carefully and im|partially enquired into and con&s;idered, and &s;uch mea&s;ures pur&s;ued,
<PB N="56" REF="034421_0429_0FFDA1EBCFB2F778">
for &s;atisfying them as the pre&s;ent melancholy circum&s;tances of this province immediately require: and we doubt not, if the Governor will be plea&s;ed to attend to, and impartially con&s;ider, what we &s;hall offer, he will be fully convinced that our conduct hath been con|&s;i&s;tent with the profe&s;&s;ion, we make, of acting on tho&s;e principles, of fearing God, honouring the king, and promoting peace among men.</P>
<P>We, therefore, beg leave to inform the Governor, that &s;oon after the fir&s;t accounts were brought of the mi&s;chief done by the <HI>Indians,</HI> on the frontiers of <HI>Virginia,</HI> &s;ome of the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> re&s;iding in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idering the fatal con&s;equences of lo&s;ing that intere&s;t and friend&s;hip our predece&s;&s;ors had obtained, by their upright dealing and ho&s;pitable treatment of the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this province; and appre|hending <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> general neglect of them, which had, for &s;ome time, been obvious, would terminate to the public di&s;advantage, deter|mined to improve every future opportunity of manife&s;ting &s;ome regard to them; and &s;everal companies of <HI>Indians,</HI> of different tribes, coming to this city on divers occa&s;ions, they were vi&s;ited by &s;ome of us, invited to our hou&s;es, and on their going away, pre&s;ented with &s;ome &s;mall matters, nece&s;&s;ary for them, in their way of living; and the grateful manner in which they received the&s;e in&s;tances of regard, and the lively remembrance, they ap|peared to retain, of the friend&s;hip, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between their ance&s;tors, and the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this province, afforded us real &s;atisfaction, and &s;ome grounds to hope our good intentions would not be di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>During the following winter, the frequent melancholy ac|counts of the barbarous murders, committed by the <HI>Indians,</HI> on the we&s;tern and northern frontiers of this province, filled the minds of people in general, with a &s;pirit of indignation and re|&s;entment again&s;t them, and no opportunity pre&s;ented of publicly manife&s;ting the earne&s;t concern we had, to u&s;e our utmo&s;t endea|vours, in a manner con&s;i&s;tent with our peaceable principles, to prevent the impending de&s;olation; the calamity became general, and every one was deeply intere&s;ted in the mea&s;ures taken for en|quiring into the cau&s;es, which induced our ancient &s;teady friends to become our enemies: yet this being the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e then concerned in the admini&s;tration of the government, we waited the event of their proceedings, having ju&s;t grounds to hope, that the knowledge &s;ome of them had of &s;everal matters, which might probably have contributed to this unhappy rupture,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were printed both in the gazettes and in their minutes.</NOTE>
<PB N="57" REF="034421_0430_0FFDA20591201820">
together with the repeated applications of the A&s;&s;embly of the province, would have excited them to pur&s;ue every rational me|thod of making &s;uch an enquiry, and obtaining an amicable ad|ju&s;tment of all differences with the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> and of thereby averting the melancholy con&s;equences of continuing to expo&s;e them immediately to the artifices of the <HI>French,</HI> who would not fail to take advantage of our mi&s;under&s;tanding with them: but the &s;pring of another year returned, and the public remained un|acquainted with &s;uch mea&s;ures being pur&s;ued; great military preparations were indeed made and &s;orts erected in many parts of the frontiers, but the de&s;olation and di&s;tre&s;s of the province in|crea&s;ed, and the &s;anguine expectations of the people, who had, at fir&s;t, hoped by the&s;e means to defend them&s;elves, were remark|ably di&s;appointed. Governor <HI>Morris,</HI> neverthele&s;s, determining to i&s;&s;ue a declaration of war again&s;t the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> many of the people called <HI>Quakers</HI> re&s;iding in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> met together and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to him, earne&s;tly be&s;eeching, "That every mea&s;ure which had been pur&s;ued, and whatever remained po&s;&s;ible to be done, to prevent &s;o lamentable an extre|mity, might be &s;trictly and impartially reviewed and con&s;idered; that full enquiry might be made, whether &s;ome apprehen&s;ions the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> had conceived of a deviation from the integrity of con|duct towards them, con&s;picuous in the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, might not unhappily have contributed, in &s;ome degree, to the alteration of their conduct towards us; that full time might be allowed for the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> who remained well affected towards us, to u&s;e and report the effect of their endeavours to reconcile our enemies to us, and that, by the Governor's care, to guard again&s;t involv|ing the innocent with the guilty, &s;uch clear demon&s;trations of Chri&s;tian tenderne&s;s might be given, as might tend to the engag|ing other neighbouring <HI>Indians</HI> in the de&s;irable work of re&s;toring peace and tranquillity; and, at the &s;ame time, offering, though a much larger part of their e&s;tates &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary, than the heavie&s;t taxes of a war could be expected to require, by voluntary grants chearfully to contribute towards the obtaining peace, in the &s;ame manner as the unhappy experience of &s;everal of the mo&s;t martial neighbouring colonies had, after long and bloody wars, te&s;tified it mu&s;t at la&s;t, if ever, be obtained."</P>
<P>Governor <HI>Morris</HI> was plea&s;ed to give a civil an&s;wer to this ad|dre&s;s; but thought it nece&s;&s;ary to proceed immediately to a decla|ration of war: a few days after which, &s;ome of us having the opportunity of a free conference with <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er,</HI> who had, as provincial interpreter, been long concerned in public tran&s;ac|tions with the <HI>Indians;</HI> we were thereby confirmed in our appre|hen&s;ions,
<PB N="58" REF="034421_0431_0FFDA1AFB6AF3CB0">
that &s;ome di&s;&s;atisfaction, re&s;pecting their lands, had tended to the alienating their friend&s;hip from us; and that he thought the only method, to &s;ave the province from ruin, was to endeavour for a peace with them, by <HI>pacific mea&s;ures;</HI> and the next day a <HI>Delaware Indian,</HI> from the <HI>Jer&s;eys,</HI> was &s;ent to one of us, with a letter from <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er,</HI> recommending him, as a per&s;on worthy of &s;ome notice from us, and fit to be employed on a me&s;&s;age to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> when an opportunity of &s;ending one could be obtained; and there being, at that time, a number of the <HI>Chiefs</HI> of the <HI>Six Nation Indians</HI> in town, &s;ome of us thought it nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome friendly notice of them; but being de|termined to avoid giving any occa&s;ion of offence, before we had any conver&s;ation with them, two of us waited on Governor <HI>Mor|ris,</HI> and informed him, "That as he had i&s;&s;ued his declaration of war, we thought it our duty to acquie&s;ce therein; but, as there were &s;ome <HI>friendly Indians</HI> in town, we were di&s;po&s;ed to take &s;ome notice of them, and to endeavour, by a friendly conver|&s;ation, to manife&s;t our good di&s;po&s;ition towards them, and engage their good offices on any occa&s;ion, which might be improved for the public welfare; and we, at the &s;ame time, a&s;&s;ured the Go|vernor if any thing &s;hould occur, which had a pro&s;pect of tend|ing to the public intere&s;t, or might be worthy of his notice, he &s;hould be fully acquainted therewith." The Governor expre&s;&s;ed his approbation of our de&s;ign, and gave us full liberty to pro&s;e|cute our intentions, and the next day &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Indian Chiefs,</HI> with <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er</HI> and <HI>Andrew Montour,</HI> the provincial interpre|ters, and <HI>D. Claus,</HI> General <HI>John&s;on</HI>'s Secretary, dined at one of our hou&s;es; and after dinner, had &s;ome conver&s;ation on the happy &s;tate of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this province, and the unhappy rup|ture, which had lately happened.</P>
<P>The free and hearty acknowledgments of plea&s;ure and gratitude, from the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> fully evidenced their good di&s;po&s;ition towards us, and induced <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er</HI> to declare, he had not lately heard them expre&s;s them&s;elves with &s;o much openne&s;s, and earne&s;tly to urge our improving this opportunity; and, in order to it, he advi&s;ed the calling together as many of our ancient men, of the &s;urvivors of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers, as we could collect, and to give the <HI>Indians</HI> another meeting, in which the &s;ub&s;tance of that conver&s;ation might be repeated, and enforced on their minds, by pre&s;enting them with a belt of <HI>wampum.</HI></P>
<P>Governor <HI>Morris</HI> was immediately informed of what had pa&s;&s;ed; and as there appeared &s;ome pro&s;pect of improving this di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Indians</HI> to the public benefit, he was a&s;&s;ured, that if he would advi&s;e and direct the manner of proceeding, nothing more
<PB N="59" REF="034421_0432_0FFDA13FE72126A0">
was de&s;ired by us than under his direction to proceed therein, in &s;uch manner as would be mo&s;t agreeable to him, mo&s;t effectually an&s;wer the purpo&s;e intended, and demon&s;trate that we did not act from views of private advantage thereby: and le&s;t the differences then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, between him and the A&s;&s;embly, about the rai&s;ing money for the public &s;ervices, &s;hould di&s;courage, or retard his en|gaging therein; he was told, that whatever &s;um of money &s;hould be wanting, even, to the amount of &pound;. 5,000, he &s;hould be im|mediately &s;upplied with, and by every part of our conduct, &s;hould find our hearty concern for the public welfare to be our principal motive.</P>
<P>Our purpo&s;es appeared acceptable to the Governor; about twenty of us, with the &s;ame interpreters, had two conferences with the <HI>Indians;</HI> and the mo&s;t material parts of what they &s;aid were immediately communicated to the Governor; and the pro|po&s;al<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was made by the <HI>Indians Chiefs,</HI> and the me&s;&s;age to be from them to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> of &s;ending three me&s;&s;engers to the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawa|ne&s;e</HI> being approved of by him, the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion was made for their &s;etting out, and proper company provided, for their &s;afe conduct through the improved part of the province; and when they were ready to proceed on their journey, the Governor being waited on for the pa&s;&s;es, and reque&s;ted to direct what &s;ignal they &s;hould give, on their return, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from enemies; while the pa&s;&s;es lay before him ready to be &s;igned, he &s;uddenly appeared to change his intentions, and &s;ignified his re&s;olution to con&s;ult his Council, on the occa&s;ion. The minutes of our con|ver&s;ation with the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> being examined and &s;igned by the three interpreters, were immediately, after this, delivered to the Governor; and, his Council being &s;ummoned, we were informed, they &s;oon agreed, that, as he had &s;o lately declared war, any of|fers of peace from him would be un&s;ea&s;onable, and that the me|thod fir&s;t propo&s;ed of the me&s;&s;engers going with &s;uch in&s;tructions, as they had received from their own <HI>chiefs,</HI> was mo&s;t fit to be pur|&s;ued. The next day the <HI>Indian chiefs</HI> &s;etting out in the &s;tage boat for <HI>New York,</HI> after they were gone, the me&s;&s;engers refu&s;ed to per|form the &s;ervice they had undertaken, and the day following, the Governor, in con&s;equence of &s;ome intelligence received from the Governor of <HI>New York,</HI> concluded to &s;end the me&s;&s;engers in his own name.</P>
<P>To prevent any mi&s;repre&s;entations of our conduct, as well as to engage the friend&s;hip of gentlemen, from whom we hoped to receive more hearty a&s;&s;i&s;tance, than we had from tho&s;e, on whom
<PB N="60" REF="034421_0433_0FFDA2217AB7E7F8">
we had hitherto depended, copies of the minutes of our conver&s;ations with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and their an&s;wers, were immediately &s;ent to the Governor of <HI>New York,</HI> and to General <HI>John&s;on,</HI> and an earne&s;t application for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in engaging the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> to promote the re&s;toration of peace, with an offer of chearfully defraying the expences thereof, Governor <HI>Hardy</HI> was &s;o kind as to &s;end &s;uch an an&s;wer as evidenced his hearty concern for the public welfare; and laid us under &s;en&s;ible obligations; and we never received the lea&s;t hint, from General <HI>John&s;on,</HI> of his di&s;approbation of any part of our conduct therein. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, we had rea&s;on to apprehend that our intention was approved of, and the &s;peedy return of the me&s;&s;engers with an agreeable an&s;wer, confirmed us in a re&s;olution to continue our en|deavours to engage as many of our fellow-&s;ubjects, as po&s;&s;ible, to concur with us therein.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;engers being &s;ent the &s;econd time, on their return brought with them the <HI>Indian king, Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> and &s;ome of his people, to <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> and repeatedly informed us of the nece&s;&s;ity of our per&s;onal attendance there, and manife&s;t thereby, and by contributing towards the expences of a &s;uitable pre&s;ent, the &s;in|cerity of our profe&s;&s;ions of regard to them; and they were not willing to go back to the <HI>Indians,</HI> without us.</P>
<P>We, therefore, being informed that Governor Morris had re|&s;olved to meet them at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The votes of A&s;&s;embly prove it.</NOTE> that the provincial trea&s;ury was exhau&s;ted, and that the Proprietaries' agents refu&s;ed to contribute towards the nece&s;&s;ary expences, and appeared aver&s;e to the pro|motion of the&s;e <HI>pacific mea&s;ures,</HI> a con&s;iderable number of us thought it nece&s;&s;ary to enter into a &s;ub&s;cription, towards rai&s;ing a fund, to &s;upply the deficiency of what ought, in ju&s;tice, to be contributed by the Proprietaries, on this occa&s;ion; and a con&s;ider|able &s;um was immediately &s;ub&s;cribed, and Governor <HI>Morris</HI> in|formed of our inclination to attend the treaty, and to make &s;ome addition to the pre&s;ent provided at the public expence. From the time of the fir&s;t me&s;&s;engers arriving at <HI>Teaogon,</HI> the ho&s;tilities on our northern frontiers cea&s;ed, and a &s;top being put to the cruel deva&s;tations that had been committed, an acceptable re&s;pite was obtained for our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fellow &s;ubjects, which afforded us real plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction; &s;o that all the malicious calumnies and a&s;per&s;ions (which then were uttered) were not &s;ufficient to divert us from the &s;teady pro&s;ecution of our purpo&s;e. Governor <HI>Morris</HI> being at <HI>Ea&s;ton</HI> &s;ome time before us, immediately after our arrival there, &s;ome of us waited on him, to repeat our de&s;ires of promot|ing

At the Governor's lodgings we fir&s;t &s;aw <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> the <HI>Delaware</HI> chief, to whom we were before utterly &s;trangers: on our coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n he immediately expre&s;&s;ed his regard for, and confidence in, the <HI>Quakers;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was in the hearing of Governor Morris.</NOTE> and declared, "He would not proceed to any bu&s;ine&s;s, unle&s;s we were pre&s;ent;" and confirmed it &s;o evidently by his &s;ub|&s;equent conduct, at that time, and the en&s;uing treaty, that we could not, without unju&s;tifiable neglect of our duty, decline con|tributing our utmo&s;t endeavours to improve this di&s;po&s;ition to the intere&s;t of our country, &s;o far as we might be able to do it, con|&s;i&s;tent with our re&s;pective &s;tations in life.</P>
<P>Governor <HI>Morris</HI> was afterwards plea&s;ed to accept of the pre|&s;ent provided by us, and to deliver it to the <HI>Indians,</HI> in our name.</P>
<P>After the conclu&s;ion of this treaty, Governor <HI>Morris</HI> thought a nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end Capt. <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> on a me&s;&s;age to the <HI>Indians,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or near fort <HI>John&s;on:</HI> but before he was &s;et out, Governor <HI>Denny</HI> arrived, and &s;ucceeded in the government of this province, and we always apprehended, that, in his name, and by his authority, Capt. <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> went on that me&s;&s;age, as we never interfered there|in, in any manner whatever, and were not informed the particular bu&s;ine&s;s he was charged with. On Captain <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>'s return, we found by conver&s;ing with him, he had given &s;ome offence to Ge|neral <HI>John&s;on,</HI> and we have &s;ince had cau&s;e to apprehend <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">From the account given by General <HI>John&s;on</HI> to the Earl of <HI>London</HI> of this jour|ney of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> it is thought the Earl was induced to expre&s;s him&s;elf in the man|ner Governor <HI>Denny</HI> has publi&s;hed in his late me&s;&s;ages to the A&s;&s;embly.</NOTE> that &s;ome gentlemen in higher &s;tations, have been informed, that we had &s;ent <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> on this me&s;&s;age, and given him matters in charge, to be privately tran&s;acted with the <HI>Indians,</HI> after it was known to us that the king had, by a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion, autho|rized Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> to negotiate all matters of a public con|cern with them; but as we had not given any occa&s;ion for &s;uch a charge, nor were any way concerned in &s;ending that me&s;&s;age, it affords us a particular plea&s;ure, that the Governor has given us to favourable an opportunity of clearing our&s;elves from this unju&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en&s;ure, and we hope that this ingenuous account of our conduct, in the cour&s;e of this bu&s;ine&s;s before the Governor's arrival, will fully evince that we proceeded therein on ju&s;t motives, and with the regard due from us to the Governor of this province.</P>

<P>From that time till the late treaty at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> we know of no part of our proceedings, which could di&s;plea&s;e the Governor, un|le&s;s our application to the Secretary, for an in&s;pection of the re|cords, in his office, had that unexpected effect.

<P><PB N="63" REF="034421_0436_0FFDA1F290C11BB8">At the &s;econd treaty, at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> the Governor, by his candid and ingenuous treatment of the <HI>Indians</HI> (as the <HI>Mohawks</HI> &s;ince aptly expre&s;&s;ed it) "Put his hand into <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI>'s bo&s;om, and was to &s;ucce&s;sful as to draw out the &s;ecret; which neither Sir William John&s;on, nor the <HI>Six Nations</HI> could do." From that time it was generally known, that one cau&s;e of the alienation of their friend|&s;hip was &s;ome inju&s;tice they had received, or &s;uppo&s;ed to be done them, in the purcha&s;es and running out of their lands. They complained of divers kinds of frauds, which had been committed, repeatedly urged, that an impartial enquiry &s;hould be made into the grounds of their complaints, by &s;earching all our records, and by the &s;trong motives of a regard to our temporal and eternal in|tere&s;t, urged the Governor to give liberty to all per&s;ons and friends to &s;earch into tho&s;e matters. Thus we thought our&s;elves under the &s;tronge&s;t obligations to make all the enquiry in our power, into the true &s;tate of the <HI>Indian</HI> claims, whether or not &s;uch care had been taken to purcha&s;e, and pay them for the lands, as the Proprietaries' Agents had con&s;tantly a&s;&s;erted. The right many of us who hold large tracts of land under the fir&s;t &s;ettlers, the Go|vernor's repeated declarations, both in public and private, that tho&s;e matters &s;hould be hone&s;tly and fully enquired into, and the <HI>Indians'</HI> injunctions that this &s;hould be done, not only by the per|&s;ons thus complained of, or their Agents, but by others likewi&s;e intere&s;ted therein, united in engaging our particular attention, and gave us a rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of meeting with the Governor's ap|probation; and though the Secretary refu&s;ed to permit us to pro|ceed therein, by in&s;pecting the records in his office, we &s;till had cau&s;e to think our farther application to the nece&s;&s;ary and import|ant concern of regaining peace, was not contrary to the Govern|or's inclination, as on our informing him of our intention to at|tend the treaty at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and our willingne&s;s to contribute to|wards the expen&s;es of the pre&s;ent, to be given to the <HI>Indians</HI> there, the Governor with the utmo&s;t readine&s;s expre&s;&s;ed his approbation of our propo&s;al; and we are not con&s;cious of having, at that treaty, or &s;ince, given the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for the alteration of his conduct towards us; which from the an&s;wer now received, and the conver&s;ion con&s;equent thereon, we have occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>We have no views incon&s;i&s;tent with the honour of our gracious king, and the intere&s;t of our country, both which we &s;incerely endeavour to promote; we have heartily de&s;ired that people of every denomination, in the province, would unite in the &s;ame good purpo&s;e, and particularly in this bu&s;ine&s;s, that the &s;ame har|mony and good under&s;tanding, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of the province and the natives, might be revived and

<P>And, if we are now &s;o happy as to convince the Governor of the integrity of our intentions and conduct, we &s;hall have rea&s;on to hope, he will concur with us, in taking the fir&s;t opportunity of convincing the nobleman he has named, that it mu&s;t be from &s;ome unju&s;t repre&s;entations, that he was induced to think, "We had pre&s;umed to treat with foreign princes, or by acting as medi|ators, between the government and an independent people, in|vaded the king's prerogative royal."

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The fir&s;t journal of <HI>Chri&s;tian Frederick Po&s;t,</HI> from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> on a me&s;&s;age from the government of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to the <HI>Delaware, Shawane&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Mingo Indians,</HI> &s;ettled there, and formerly in alliance with the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> in order to prevail on them to withdraw from the French intere&s;t; in the year <HI>1758.</HI> London, printed for John Wilkie, &amp;c. <HI>1759;</HI> with the notes, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>CHRISTIAN FREDERICK POST was a plain, hone&s;t, re|ligiou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed <HI>German,</HI> and one of the Moravian brethren; who, from a con&s;cientious opinion of duty, formerly had lived among the <HI>Mohiccon Indians,</HI> with a view to convert them to <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI></P>
<P>He had married twice among them, and lived with them &s;even|teen years. It was a dangerous undertaking; and though he was an illiterate per&s;on, and his narrative &s;eemingly artle&s;s and un|couth, yet being a man of &s;incerity, acquainted with the <HI>Indian</HI> manners, and the importance of the affair, at that time, being very intere&s;ting, the <HI>Indian</HI> cu&s;tom of treating on public affairs may thereby partly appear, and be entertaining. The event &s;hewed the propriety of u&s;ing rea&s;on, and friendly treatment, or true po|licy, towards the <HI>Indians,</HI> in preference to force, or violence, when it may be done: the former of which had &s;o long been &s;uc|ce&s;sfully u&s;ed by the more early &s;ettlers of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and the latter &s;o lately attended with unhappy con&s;equences, &amp;c.</P>

<P><HI>July the</HI> 15th, 1758.&mdash;This day I received orders from his ho|nour, the Governor, to &s;et out on my intended journey, and pro|ceeded as far as <HI>German Town,</HI> where I found all the <HI>Indians</HI> drunk.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All Indians are exce&s;&s;ive fond of rum, and will be drunk whenever they can get it.</NOTE> <HI>Willamegicken</HI> returned to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> for a hor&s;e, that was promi&s;ed him.</P>

<P><PB N="66" REF="034421_0439_0FFDA22940F9B1E0"><HI>July</HI> 17th. I arrived at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and prepared for my journey.</P>
<P>&mdash;18th. I read over both the la&s;t treaties, that at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> and that at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and made my&s;elf acquainted with the particu|lars of each.</P>
<P>&mdash;19th. With much difficulty I per&s;uaded the <HI>Indians</HI> to leave <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and travelled this day no further than <HI>Hayes</HI>'s, having a hard &s;hower of rain.</P>
<P>&mdash;20th. Arrived at fort <HI>Allen.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;21&s;t. I called my company together, to know if we &s;hould proceed. They complained they were &s;ick, and mu&s;t re&s;t that day. This day, I think, <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> laid many ob&s;tacles in my way, and was very much again&s;t my proceeding: he &s;aid, he was afraid I &s;hould never return; and that the Indians would kill me. About dinner time two <HI>Indians</HI> arrived from <HI>Wyoming,</HI> with an account that <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI>'s &s;on, <HI>Hans Jacob,</HI> was returned, and brought news from the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Allegheny Indians. Teedyu&s;cung</HI> then called a Council, and propo&s;ed that I &s;hould only go to <HI>Wyoming,</HI> and return, with the me&s;&s;age his &s;on had brought, to <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> I made an&s;wer, that it was too late, that he &s;hould have propo&s;ed that in <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> for that the writings containing my orders were &s;o drawn, as obliged me to go, though I &s;hould lo&s;e my life.</P>
<P>&mdash;22d. I de&s;ired my companions to prepare to &s;et out, upon which <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> called them all together in the fort, and pro|te&s;ted again&s;t my going. His rea&s;ons were, that he was afraid the <HI>Indians</HI> would kill me, or the <HI>French</HI> get me; and if that &s;hould be the ca&s;e he &s;hould be very &s;orry, and did not know what he &s;hould do. I gave for an&s;wer, "that I did not know what to think of their conduct. It is plain, &s;aid I, that the <HI>French</HI> have a <HI>public road</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An <HI>India<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> expre&s;&s;ion meaning free admi&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> to your towns, yet you will not let your own fle&s;h and blood, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> come near them; which is very hard: and if that be the ca&s;e, the <HI>French</HI> mu&s;t be your ma&s;ters." I ad|ded, that, if I died in the undertaking, it would be as much for the <HI>Indians</HI> as the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and that I hoped my journey would be of this advantage, that it would be the means of &s;aving the lives of many hundreds of the <HI>Indians:</HI> therefore, I was re&s;olved to go forward, taking my life in my hand, as one ready to part with it for their good. Immediately after I had &s;poken thus, three ro&s;e up and offered to go with me the neare&s;t way; and we concluded to go through the inhabitants, under the Blue mountains to &s;ort <HI>Au|gu&s;ta,</HI> on <HI>Su&s;quahanna;</HI> where we arrived the 25th.</P>
<P>It gave me great pain to ob&s;erve many plantations de&s;erted and laid wa&s;te; and I could not but reflect on the di&s;tre&s;s, the poor

owners mu&s;t be drove to, who once lived in plenty; and I prayed the Lord to re&s;tore peace and pro&s;perity to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>At fort <HI>Augu&s;ta</HI> we were entertained very kindly, had our hor&s;es &s;hod, and one being lame, we exchanged for another. Here we received, by <HI>Indians</HI> from <HI>Diahogo,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An Indian &s;ettlement towards the heads of Su&s;quahanna.</NOTE> the di&s;agreeable news that our army was, as they &s;aid, entirely cut off at <HI>Ticonderoga,</HI> which di&s;|couraged one of my companions, <HI>Lappopetung</HI>'s &s;on, &s;o much, that he would proceed no further. <HI>Shamokin Daniel</HI> here a&s;ked me, if I thought he &s;hould be &s;atisfied for his trouble in going with me. I told him every body, that did any &s;ervice for the province, I thought, would be paid.</P>
<P>&mdash;27th. They furni&s;hed us here with every nece&s;&s;ary for our journey, and we &s;et out with good courage. After we rode about ten miles, we were caught in a hard gu&s;t of rain.</P>
<P>&mdash;28th. We came to <HI>Wekeeponall,</HI> where the road turns off for <HI>Wyoming,</HI> and &s;lept this night at <HI>Queena&s;hawakee.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;29th. We cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Su&s;quahanna</HI> over the <HI>Big I&s;land.</HI> My companions were now very fearful, and this night went a great way out of the road, to &s;leep without fire, but could not &s;leep for the mu&s;quetoes and vermin.</P>
<P>&mdash;30th &amp; 31&s;t. We were glad it was day, that we might &s;et out. We got upon the mountains, and had heavy rains all night. The heavens alone were our covering, and we accepted of all that was poured down from thence.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1&s;t. We &s;aw three hoops <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Little hoops on which the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;tretch and dre&s;s the raw &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> on a bu&s;h; to one of them there remained &s;ome long white hair. Our hor&s;es left us, I &s;uppo&s;e, not being fond of the dry food on the mountains: with a good deal of trouble we found them again. We &s;lept this night on the &s;ame mountain.</P>
<P>&mdash;2d. We came acro&s;s &s;everal places where two poles, painted red, were &s;tuck in the ground by the <HI>Indians,</HI> to which they tye the pri&s;oners, when they &s;top at night, in their return from their incur&s;ions. We arrived this night at <HI>Shinglimuhee,</HI> where was another of the &s;ame po&s;ts. It is a di&s;agreeable and melancholy fight, to &s;ee the means they make u&s;e of, according to their &s;avage way, to di&s;tre&s;s others.</P>
<P>&mdash;3d. We came to a part of a river called <HI>Tobeco,</HI> over the mountains, a very bad road.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="034421_0441_0FFDA1596DA22CB8"><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 4th. We lo&s;t one of our hor&s;es, and with much dif|ficulty found him, but were detained a whole day on that account.</P>
<P>I had much conver&s;ation with <HI>Pi&s;quetumen;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An <HI>Indian</HI> Chief, that travelled with him.</NOTE> of which I think to inform my&s;elf further when I get to my journey's end.</P>
<P>&mdash;5th. We &s;et out early this day, and made a good long &s;tretch, cro&s;&s;ing the big river <HI>Tobeco,</HI> and lodged between two mountains. I had the misfortune to lo&s;e my pocket book with three pounds five &s;hillings,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The money of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> being paper, is chiefly carried in pocket books.</NOTE> and &s;undry other things. What writings it con|tained were illegible to any body but my&s;elf.</P>
<P>&mdash;6th. We pa&s;&s;ed all the mountains, and the big river, <HI>We&s;ha|waucks,</HI> and cro&s;&s;ed a fine meadow two miles in length, where we &s;lept that night, having nothing to eat.</P>
<P>&mdash;7th. We came in &s;ight of fort <HI>Venango,</HI> belonging to the <HI>French,</HI> &s;ituate between two mountains, in a fork of the <HI>Ohio</HI> river. I prayed the Lord to blind them, as he did the enemies of <HI>Lot</HI> and <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> that I might pa&s;s unknown. When we arrived, the fort being on the other &s;ide of the river, we hallooed, and de&s;ired them to fetch us over; which they were afraid to do; but &s;hewed us a place where we might ford. We &s;lept that night within half gun &s;hot of the fort.</P>
<P>&mdash;8th. This morning I hunted for my hor&s;e, round the fort, within ten yards of it. The Lord heard my prayer, and I pa&s;&s;ed unknown till we had mounted our hor&s;es to go off, when two <HI>Frenchmen</HI> came to take leave of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and were much &s;ur|pri&s;ed at &s;eeing me, but &s;aid nothing.</P>
<P>By what I could learn of <HI>Pi&s;quetumen,</HI> and the <HI>Indians,</HI> who went into the fort, the garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of only &s;ix men, and an officer blind of one eye. They enquired much of the <HI>Indians</HI> concerning the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> whether they knew of any party coming to attack them, of which they were very apprehen&s;ive.</P>
<P>&mdash;9th. Heavy rains all night and day: we &s;lept on &s;wampy ground.</P>
<P>&mdash;10th. We imagined we were near <HI>Ku&s;hku&s;hkee;</HI> and having travelled three miles, we met three <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> who appeared ve|ry &s;hy of us, but &s;aid nothing more than to enquire, whether we knew of any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> coming again&s;t fort <HI>Venango.</HI></P>
<P>After we travelled two miles farther, we met with an <HI>Indian,</HI> and one that I took to be a runagade <HI>Engli&s;h Indian</HI> trader; he &s;poke good <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> was very curious in examining every thing,

particularly the &s;ilver medal about Pi&s;quitumen's neck. He ap|peared by his countenance to be guilty. We enquired of them where we were, and found we were lo&s;t, and within twenty miles of fort <HI>Duque&s;ne.</HI> We &s;truck out of the road to the right, and &s;lept between two mountains; and being de&s;titute of food, two went to hunt, and the others to &s;eek a road, but to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>&mdash;11th. We went to the place were they had killed two deers, and <HI>Pi&s;quetumen</HI> and I roa&s;ted the meat. Two went to hunt for the road, to know which way we &s;hould go: one came back, and had found a road; the other lo&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>&mdash;12th. The re&s;t of us hunted for him, but in vain; &s;o, as we could not find him, we concluded to &s;et off, leaving &s;uch marks, that, if he returned, he might know which way to follow us; and we left him &s;ome meat.

<P>About noon we met &s;ome <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> that u&s;ed to live at <HI>Wyo|ming.</HI> They knew me, and received me very kindly.

<P>In the evening king Beaver came again, and told me, they had held a council, and &s;ent out to all their towns, but it would take five days before they could all come together. I thanked him for his care. Ten captains came and &s;aluted me. One &s;aid to the others; "We never expected to &s;ee our brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> again, but now God has granted us once more to &s;hake hands with them, which we will not forget." They &s;at by my fire till midnight.</P>
<P>&mdash;14th. The people crowded to my hou&s;e; it was full. We had much talk. <HI>Delaware George</HI> &s;aid, he had not &s;lept all night, &s;o much had he been engaged on account of my coming.

There were in all thirteen, who dined together.</P>
<P>In the evening they danced at my fire, fir&s;t the men, and then the women, till after midnight.</P>
<P>On the 16th, the king and the captains called on me privately. They wanted to hear what <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> had &s;aid of them, and beg|ged me to take out the writings. I read to them what <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> had &s;aid, and told them, as <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> had &s;aid he would &s;peak &s;o loud, that all at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> and beyond, &s;hould hear it, I would conceal nothing from them.

I then told them I would read the re&s;t, and leave out that part, and they might tell the kings and captains of it, when they came together.</P>
<P>&mdash; 17th. Early this morning they called all the people toge|ther to clean the place, where they intended to hold the council, it being in the middle of the town. <HI>Ku&s;hku&s;hkee</HI> is divided into four towns, each at a di&s;tance from the others; and the whole con&s;i&s;ts of about ninety hou&s;es, and two hundred able warriors.</P>
<P>About noon two public me&s;&s;engers arrived from the <HI>Indians</HI> at fort <HI>Duque&s;ne</HI> and the other towns.

&s;urly. When I went to &s;hake hands with one of them, he gave me his little finger; the other withdrew his hand entirely; upon which I appeared as &s;tout as either, and withdrew my hand as quick as I could. Their rudene&s;s to me was taken very ill by the other cap|tains, who treated them in the &s;ame manner in their turn.</P>
<P>I told them my order was to go to the <HI>Indian</HI> towns, kings and captains, and not to the <HI>French;</HI> that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were at was with the French, but not with tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> who withdrew from the <HI>French,</HI> and would be at peace with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>King Beaver invited me to his hou&s;e to dinner, and afterwards he invited the <HI>French</HI> captain, and &s;aid before the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> that the <HI>Indians</HI> were very proud to &s;ee one of their brothers, the <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> among them; at which the <HI>French</HI> captain appeared low &s;pi|rited, and &s;eemed to eat his dinner with very little appetite.</P>

<P>In the afternoon, all the kings and captains were called together, and &s;ent for me to their council. King Beaver fir&s;t add<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf to the captains; and afterwards &s;poke to me, as follows:</P>

<P>King <HI>Beaver, Shingas,</HI> and <HI>Delaware George,</HI> &s;poke as follows:</P>
<P>"Brother, we alone cannot make a peace; it would be of no &s;ignification; for, as all the <HI>Indians,</HI> from the &s;un-ri&s;e to the &s;un|&s;et, are united in a body, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the whole &s;hould join in the peace, or it can be no peace; and we can a&s;&s;ure you, all the <HI>Indians,</HI> a great way from this, even beyond the lakes, are de&s;irous of, and wi&s;h for a peace with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and have de&s;ired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, as we are the neare&s;t of kin, if we &s;ee the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> incline to a peace, to hold it fa&s;t."</P>
<P>On the 19th, all the people gathered together, men, women, and children; and king <HI>Beaver</HI> de&s;ired me to read to them the news I had brought, and told me that all the able men would go with me to the other town. I complied with his de&s;ire, and they ap|peared very much plea&s;ed at every thing, till I came to that part re&s;pecting the pri&s;oners. This they di&s;liked; for, they &s;ay, it appears very odd and unrea&s;onable that we &s;hould demand pri&s;on|ers before there is an e&s;tabli&s;hed peace; &s;uch an unrea&s;onable de|mand makes us appear as if we wanted brains.</P>
<P>&mdash;20th. We &s;et out from <HI>Ku&s;hku&s;hkee,</HI> for <HI>Sankonk;</HI> my com|pany con&s;i&s;ted of twenty-five hor&s;emen and fifteen foot. We ar|rived at <HI>Sankonk,</HI> in the afternoon. The people of the town were much di&s;turbed at my coming, and received me in a very rough manner. They &s;urrounded me with drawn knives in their hands, in &s;uch a manner, that I could hardly get along; running up again&s;t me; with their brea&s;ts open, as if they wanted &s;ome pre|tence to kill me. I &s;aw by their countenances they &s;ought my death. Their faces were quite di&s;torted with rage, and they went &s;o far as to &s;ay, I &s;hould not live long; but &s;ome <HI>Indians,</HI> with whom I was formerly acquainted, coming up, and &s;aluting me in a friendly manner, their behaviour to me was quickly changed.</P>

<P>I prote&s;ted again&s;t going to Fort <HI>Duque&s;ne,</HI> but all in vain; for they in&s;i&s;ted on my going, and &s;aid that I need not fear the <HI>French,</HI> for they would carry me in their bo&s;oms, i. e. engage for my &s;afety.</P>
<P>&mdash;23d. We &s;et off for Fort <HI>Duque&s;ne,</HI> and went no farther this night than Log's town, where I met with four <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> who lived in <HI>Wyoming</HI> when I did. They received me very kindly, and called the pri&s;oners to &s;hake hands with me, as their country|man, and gave me leave to go into every hou&s;e to &s;ee them, which was done in no other town be&s;ides.</P>
<P>&mdash;24th. They called to me, and de&s;ired that I would write to the general for them. The jealou&s;y natural to the <HI>Indians</HI> is not to be de&s;cribed; for though they wanted me to write for them, they were afraid I would, at the &s;ame time, give other information, and this perplexed them.</P>
<P>We continued our journey to the fort; and arrived in &s;ight, on this &s;ide the river, in the afternoon, and all the <HI>Indian</HI> chiefs immediately came over; they called me into the middle, and king <HI>Beaver</HI> pre&s;ented me to them, and &s;aid, "Here is our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> brother, who has brought great news."

More|over let us look up to God, and beg for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that he may put into our hearts what plea&s;es him, and join us clo&s;e in that bro|therly love and friend&s;hip, which our grandfathers had. We a&s;&s;ure you of our love towards you." A belt of eleven rows.</P>
<P>"Brothers at Allegheny, Hearken to what I &s;ay; we began to hear of you from <HI>Wellemeghihink,</HI> who returned from <HI>Allegheny.</HI> We heard you had but a &s;light confu&s;ed account of us; and did not know of the peace, we made twelve months pa&s;t, in <HI>Ea&s;ton.</HI> It was then agreed, that the large belt of peace &s;hould be &s;ent to you at <HI>Allegheny.</HI> As the&s;e our two old friends from <HI>Allegheny,</HI> who are well known to many here, found an opening to come to our council fire, to &s;ee with their own eyes, to &s;it with us face to face, to hear with their own ears, every thing that has been tran&s;|acted between us; it gives me and all the people of the province great plea&s;ure to &s;ee them among us. And I a&s;&s;ure all my brethren at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> that nothing would plea&s;e me, and all the people of the province better, than to &s;ee our countrymen the <HI>Delawares</HI> well &s;ettled among us." A belt.</P>
<P>"Hearken, my brethren at <HI>Allegheny.</HI> When we began to make peace with the <HI>Delawares,</HI> twelve months ago, in behalf of ten other nations, we opened a road, and cleared the bu&s;hes from the blood, and gathered all the bones, on both &s;ides, together; and when we had brought them together, in one heap, we could find no place to bury them: we would not bury them as our grandfa|thers did. They buried them under ground, where they may be found again. We prayed to God, that he would have mercy on us, and take all the&s;e bones away from us, and hide them, that they might never be found any more; and take from both &s;ides all the remem|brance of them out of our heart and mind. And we have a firm confidence, that God will be plea&s;ed to take all the bones and hide them from us, that they may never be remembered by us, while we live, nor our children, nor grand children, hereafter. The hatchet was buried on both &s;ides, and large belts of peace

This belt a&s;|&s;ures you of our &s;incerity, and hone&s;t and upright heart towards you." A belt of &s;even rows.</P>
<P>"Hearken, brethren at <HI>Allegheny.</HI> I have told you that we really made peace with part of your nation, twelve months pa&s;t; I now by this belt open the road from <HI>Allegheny</HI> to our council fire, where your grandfathers kept good councils with us, that all may pa&s;s without mole&s;tation or danger. You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that unle&s;s a road be kept open, people at variance can never to|gether to make up their differences. Me&s;&s;engers are free in all na|tions throughout the world, by a particular token. Now, bre|thren at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> I de&s;ire you will join with me in keeping the road open, and let us know in what manner we may come free to you, and what the token &s;hall be. I join both my hands to yours, and will do all in my power to keep the road open." A belt of &s;even rows.</P>
<P>"Now, brethren at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> Hear what I &s;ay. Every one that lays hold of this belt of peace, I proclaim peace to them from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation, and let you know that the great king of <HI>England</HI> does not incline to have war with the <HI>Indians;</HI> but he wants to live in peace and love with them, if they will lay down the hatchet, and loave off war again&s;t him."</P>
<P>"We love you farther, we let you know that the great king of <HI>England</HI> has &s;ent a great number of warriors into this country, not to go to war again&s;t the <HI>Indians,</HI> in their towns, no, not at all; the&s;e warriors are going again&s;t the <HI>French;</HI> they are on the march to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> to revenge the blood they have &s;hed. And by this belt I take you by the hand, and lead you at a di&s;tance from the <HI>French,</HI> for your own &s;afety, that your legs may not be &s;tained with blood. Come away on this &s;ide of the mountain, where we may oftener conver&s;e together, and where your own fle&s;h and blood lives. We look upon you as our countrymen, that &s;prung out of the &s;ame ground with us; we think, therefore, that it is our duty to take care of you, and we in brotherly love advi&s;e you to come away with your whole nation, and as many of your friends as you can get to follow you. We do not come to hurt you, we love you, therefore we do not call you to war, that you may be &s;lain; what be|nefit will it be to you to go to war with your own fle&s;h and blood?

We have opened the road to the council fire, therefore, my brethren, come and acquaint the Governor with it; you will be readily heard, and full ju&s;tice will be done you." A belt.</P>
<P>"Brethren, One thing I mu&s;t bring to your remembrance. You know, if any body lo&s;es a little child, or &s;ome body takes it from him, he cannot be ea&s;y, he will think on his child by day and night; &s;ince our fle&s;h and blood is in captivity, in the <HI>Indian</HI> towns, we de&s;ire you will rejoice the country's heart, and bring them to me; I &s;hall &s;tretch out my arms to receive you kindly." A &s;tring.</P>
<P>After I had done, I left my belts and &s;trings &s;till before them. The <HI>Delawares</HI> took them all up, and laid them before the <HI>Min|goes;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Six Nations.</NOTE> upon which they ro&s;e up, and &s;poke as follows:</P>
<P><HI>"Chau,</HI> What I have heard plea&s;es me well; I do not know why I go to war again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h. Noques,</HI> what do you think? You mu&s;t be &s;trong. I did not begin the war, therefore, I have little to &s;ay; but whatever you agree to, I will do the &s;ame." Then he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> and &s;aid, "You brought the hatchet to us from the <HI>French,</HI> and per&s;uaded us to &s;trike our brothers the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> you may con&s;ider (laying the belts, &amp;c. before them) wherefore you have done this."</P>
<P>The <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> acknowledged they received the hatchet from the <HI>French,</HI> who per&s;uaded them to &s;trike the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> that they would now &s;end the belts to all the <HI>Indians,</HI> and in twelve days would meet again.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ent at this council, three hundred <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> They all took leave, and went over again to the fort, but my com|panions, who were about &s;eventy in number.</P>
<P><HI>Shamokin Daniel,</HI> who came with me, went over to the fort by him&s;elf, (which my companions di&s;approved of) and coun&s;elled with the Governor; who pre&s;ented him with a laced coat and hat, a blanket, &s;hirts, ribbons, a new gun, powder, lead, &amp;c. When he returned he was quite changed, and &s;aid, "See here, you

fools, what the <HI>French</HI> have given me. I was in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and never received a farthing;" and, directing him&s;elf to me, he &s;aid, "The Engli&s;h are fools, and &s;o are you." In &s;hort, he behaved in a very proud, &s;aucy and imperious manner. He further &s;aid, "The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> never give the <HI>Indians</HI> any powder, and that the <HI>French</HI> would have given him a hor&s;eload, if he would have taken it; &s;ee that young man there, he was in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> and never got on thing; I will take him over to the <HI>French,</HI> and get &s;ome cloathing for him."</P>
<P>Three <HI>Indians</HI> informed me, that as &s;oon as the <HI>French</HI> got over, they called a council, with their own <HI>Indians,</HI> among whom there happened accidentally to be a <HI>Delaware</HI> captain, who was privately invited by one of his acquaintance to hear what the French had to &s;ay; and when they were a&s;&s;embled, the <HI>French</HI> &s;poke, as fol|lows:</P>
<P>"My children, now we are alone, hearken to what I have to &s;ay. I perceive the <HI>Delawares</HI> are wavering; they incline to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and will be faithful to us no longer. Now all their chiefs are here, and but a handful, let us cut them off, and then we &s;hall be troubled with them no longer." Then the <HI>Tawaas</HI> an|&s;wered, "No, we cannot do this thing; for though there is but a handful here, the <HI>Delawares</HI> are a &s;trong people, and are &s;pread to a great di&s;tance, and whatever they agree to mu&s;t be."</P>
<P>This afternoon, in council, on the other &s;ide of the river, the <HI>French</HI> in&s;i&s;ted that I mu&s;t be delivered up to them, and that it was not lawful for me to go away; which occa&s;ioned a quarrel be|tween them and the <HI>Indians,</HI> who immediately came away and cro&s;&s;ed the river to me; and &s;ome of them let me know that <HI>Da|niel</HI> had received a &s;tring from the <HI>French,</HI> to leave me there; but it was to no purpo&s;e, for they would not give their con&s;ent; and then agreed that I &s;hould &s;et off before day the next morning.</P>
<P>&mdash;27th. Accordingly I &s;et out before day, with &s;ix <HI>Indians,</HI> and took another road, that we might not be &s;een; the main body told me, they would &s;tay behind, to know whether the <HI>French</HI> would make an attempt to take me by force; that if they did, they, the <HI>Indians,</HI> would endeavour to prevent their cro&s;&s;ing the river, and coming &s;ecretly upon me. Ju&s;t as I &s;et off the <HI>French</HI> fired all their great guns, it being Sunday (I counted nineteen) and concluded they did the &s;ame every Sabbath. We pa&s;&s;ed through three <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> towns; the <HI>Indians</HI> appeared very proud to &s;ee me return, and we arrived about night at <HI>Sawcunk,</HI> where they were likewi&s;e very glad to &s;ee me return. Here I met with the two captains, who treated me &s;o uncivilly before; they now

He &s;poke in a very &s;oft and ea&s;y manner. I told him that was a great while ago, it was all forgotten and wiped clean away; that the Engli&s;h would receive him very kindly. Then <HI>Daniel</HI> inter|rupted me, and &s;aid to <HI>Shingas,</HI> "Do not believe him, he tells nothing but idle lying &s;tories.

Then <HI>Daniel</HI> &s;aid, "D&mdash;n you, why do not you and the <HI>French</HI> &s;ight on the &s;ea? You come here only to cheat the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> and take their land from them." Then <HI>Shingas</HI> told him to be &s;till; for he did not know what he &s;aid.

<P><PB N="82" REF="034421_0455_0FFDA1A6FAF27440">Then &s;even chiefs pre&s;ent &s;aid, when the Governor &s;ends the next me&s;&s;enger, let him &s;end two or three white men, at lea&s;t, to confirm the thing, and not &s;end &s;uch a man as <HI>Daniel;</HI> they did not under&s;tand him; he always &s;peaks, &s;aid they, as if he was drunk; and if a great many of them had not known me, they &s;hould not know what to think; for every thing I &s;aid he contradicted.

<P>I &s;aid, we did not intend to take the land from them; but only to drive the <HI>French</HI> away.

that our hearts are better than yours. It is plain that you white people are the cau&s;e of this war; why do not you and the <HI>French</HI> fight in the old country, and on the &s;ea?

<P>They &s;aid, "Brother, your heart is good, you &s;peak always &s;in|cerely; but we know there are always a great number of people that want to get rich; they never have enough: look, we do not want to be rich, and take away that which others have.

Look now, my brother, the white people think we have no brains in our heads; but that they are great and big, and that makes them make war with us: we are but a little handful to what you are; but remember, when you look for a wild turkey you cannot always find it, it is &s;o little it hides it&s;elf under the bu&s;hes: and when you hunt for a rattle|&s;nake, you cannot find it; and perhaps it will bite you before you &s;ee it.

There are a great number of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> traders now among the <HI>Indians,</HI> who have always endeavoured to &s;pirit up the <HI>Indians</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> which made &s;ome, that I was acquainted with from their infancy, de&s;ire the chiefs to enquire of me, for that they were certain I would &s;peak the truth.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="034421_0458_0FFDA1AC18A19E48"><HI>Pi&s;quetumen</HI> now told me, we could not go to the General, that it was very dangerous, the <HI>French</HI> having &s;ent out &s;everal &s;couts to wait for me on the road. And further, <HI>Pi&s;quetumen</HI> told me, it was a pity the Governor had no ear<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No &s;py among his enemies.</NOTE>, to bring him intelligence; that the <HI>French</HI> had three ears, whom they rewarded with great pre&s;ents; and &s;ignified, that he and <HI>Shingas</HI> would be ears, at the &s;ervice of his honour, if he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>&mdash;2d. I bade <HI>Shingas</HI> to make ha&s;te and di&s;patch me, and once more de&s;ired to know of them, if it was po&s;&s;ible for them to guide me to the General. Of all which they told me they would con&s;i|der; and <HI>Shingas</HI> gave me his hand, and &s;aid, "Brother, the next time you come, I will return with you to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and will do all in my power to prevent any body's coming to hurt the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> more."</P>
<P>&mdash;3d. To-day I found my&s;elf unwell, and made a little tea, which refre&s;hed me: had many very pretty di&s;cour&s;es with <HI>George.</HI> In the afternoon they called a council together, and gave me the following an&s;wer in council; the &s;peaker addre&s;&s;ing the Governor and people of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania:</HI></P>
<P>"Brethren, It is a great many days &s;ince we have &s;een and heard you.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">That is, &s;ince we had a friendly intercour&s;e with each other. The frequent re|petition of the word, <HI>Brethren,</HI> is the effect of their rules of politene&s;s, which enjoin, in all conver&s;ations, a con&s;tant remembrance of the relation &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the parties, e&s;pecially where that relation implies any affection, or re&s;pect. It is like the perpetual repetitions among us, of <HI>Sir,</HI> or, <HI>Madam,</HI> or, <HI>Your Lord&s;hip.</HI> In the &s;ame manner the <HI>Indians</HI> at every &s;entence repeat, <HI>My Father, My Uncle, My Cou&s;in, My Brother, My Friend,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> I now &s;peak to you in behalf of all the nations, that have heard you heretofore.</P>
<P>"Brethren, it is the fir&s;t me&s;&s;age which we have &s;een or heard from you. Brethren, you have talked of that peace and friend|&s;hip which we had formerly with you. Brethren, we tell you to be &s;trong, and always remember that friend&s;hip, which we had formerly. Brethren, we de&s;ire you would be &s;trong, and let us once more hear of our good friend&s;hip and peace, we had former|ly.

<P>"Brethren, near what I have to &s;ay: look, brethren, we, who have now &s;een and heard you, we, who are pre&s;ent, are part of all the &s;everal nations, that heard you &s;ome days ago; we &s;ee that you are &s;orry we have not that friend&s;hip, we formerly had.</P>

Brethren, we long for that peace and friend&s;hip we had formerly. Brethren, it is good that you de&s;ire that friend&s;hip, that was formerly among our fathers and grandfathers. Brethren, we will tell you, you mu&s;t not let that friend&s;hip be quite lo&s;t, which was formerly between us.</P>
<P>"Now, brethren, it is three years &s;ince we dropt that peace and friend&s;hip, which we formerly had with you.

Brethren, when you have fini&s;hed this peace, which you have begun; when it is known every where among&s;t your brethren, and you have every where agreed together on this peace and friend&s;hip, then you will be plea&s;ed to &s;end the great peace belt to us at <HI>Allegheny.</HI></P>
<P>"Brethren, when you have &s;ettled this peace and friend&s;hip, and fini&s;hed it well, and you &s;end the great peace-belt to me, I will &s;end it to all the nations of my colour, they will all join to it, and we all will hold it fa&s;t.</P>
<P>"Brethren, when all the nations join to this friend&s;hip, then the day will begin to &s;hine clear over us. When we hear once more of you, and we join together, then the day will be &s;till, and no wind, or &s;torm, will come over us, to di&s;turb us.</P>
<P>"Now, brethren, you know our hearts, and what we have to &s;ay; be &s;trong; if you do what we have now told you, and in this peace all the nations agree to join.

<P>&mdash;4th. Pre&s;ent, <HI>Shingas,</HI> King <HI>Beaver, Pi&s;quetumen,</HI> and &s;e|veral others. I a&s;ked what they meant by &s;aying, <HI>"They had not rightly heard me yet."</HI> They &s;aid,</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="034421_0461_0FFDA144E674AA60">"Brother, you very well know that you have collected all your young men about the country, which makes a large body;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Meaning General Forbes's army.</NOTE> and now they are &s;tanding <HI>before our doors;</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>I, E.</HI> Ju&s;t ready to enter our country.</NOTE> you come with good news, and fine &s;peeches. Brother, this is what makes us jealous, and we do not know what to think of it: if you had brought the news of peace before your army had begun to march, it would have cau&s;ed a great deal more good. We do not &s;o readily be|lieve you, becau&s;e a great many great men and traders have told us, long before the war, that you and the <HI>French</HI> intended to join and cut all the <HI>Indians</HI> off. The&s;e were people of your own colour, and your own countrymen; and &s;ome told us to join the <HI>French;</HI> for that they would be our fathers: be&s;ides, many runaways have told us the &s;ame &s;tory; and &s;ome we took pri&s;oners told us how you would u&s;e us, if you caught us: therefore, brother, I &s;ay, we cannot conclude, at this time, but mu&s;t &s;ee and hear you once more." And further they &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Now, brother, you are here with us, you are our fle&s;h and blood, &s;peak from the bottom of your heart, will not the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> join together to cut off the <HI>Indians?</HI> Speak, brother, from your heart, and tell us the truth, and let us know who were the beginners of the war."</P>
<P>Then I delivered my&s;elf thus:</P>
<P>"Brothers, I love you from the bottom of my heart. I am extremely &s;orry to &s;ee the jealou&s;y &s;o deeply rooted in your hearts and minds. I have told you the truth; and yet, if I was to tell it you a hundred times, it &s;eems you would not rightly believe me. My <HI>Indian</HI> brothers, I wi&s;h you would draw your hearts to God, that he may convince you of the truth.</P>
<P>"I do now declare, before God, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> never did, nor never will, join with the <HI>French</HI> to de&s;troy you. As far as I know, the <HI>French</HI> are the beginners of this war. Brothers, about twelve years ago, you may remember, they had war with the Engli&s;h, and they both agreed to articles of peace. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> gave up <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Breton</HI> in <HI>Acadia,</HI> but the <HI>French</HI> never gave up the part of that country, which they had agreed to give up; and, in a very little time, made their <HI>Children</HI> &s;trike the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> This was the fir&s;t cau&s;e of the war. Now, brothers; if any body &s;trike you three times, one after another, you &s;till &s;it &s;till and con&s;ider: they &s;trike you again, then, my brothers, you &s;ay, it is time, and you will ri&s;e up to defend your&s;elves. Now, my brothers, this is exactly the ca&s;e between the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Con&s;ider farther,
<PB N="89" REF="034421_0462_0FFDA146E4A024F8">
my brothers, what a great number of our poor back inhabitants have been killed &s;ince the <HI>French</HI> came to the <HI>Ohio.</HI> The French are the cau&s;e of their death, and if they were not there, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would not trouble them&s;elves to go there. They go no where to war, but where the French are. Tho&s;e wicked people that &s;et you at variance with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by telling you many wicked &s;to|ries, are papi&s;ts in French pay: be&s;ides, there are many among us, in the <HI>French</HI> &s;ervice, who appear like gentlemen, and buy Iri&s;h papi&s;t &s;ervants, and promi&s;e them great rewards to run away to you and &s;trengthen you again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by making them appear as black as devils."</P>
<P>This day arrived here two hundred <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> on their way to <HI>fort Duque&s;ne.</HI> They &s;taid all night. In the middle of the night king <HI>Beaver</HI>'s daughter died, on which a great many guns were fired in the town.</P>
<P>&mdash;5th. It made a general &s;top in my journey. The <HI>French</HI> &s;aid to their Children, they &s;hould catch me privately, or get my &s;calp. The commander wanted to examine me, as he was going to <HI>fort Duque&s;ne.</HI> When they told me of it, I &s;aid, as he was going to <HI>fort Duque&s;ne,</HI> he might enquire about me there: I had nothing at all to &s;ay, or do with the <HI>French:</HI> they would tell them every particular they wanted to know in the fort. They all came into the hou&s;e where I was, as if they would &s;ee a new creature.</P>
<P>In the afternoon there came &s;ix <HI>Indians,</HI> and brought three Ger|man pri&s;oners, and two &s;calps of the <HI>Catabaws.</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>Daniel</HI> blamed the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that they never paid him for his trouble, I a&s;ked him whether he was plea&s;ed with what I paid him. He &s;aid, no. I &s;aid, "Brother, you took as much as you plea&s;ed." I a&s;ked you, whether you was &s;atisfied; you &s;aid, yes. I told him, I was a&s;hamed to hear him blame the country &s;o. I bid him, "You &s;hall have for this journey whatever you de&s;ire, when I reach the inhabitants."</P>
<P>&mdash;6th. <HI>Pi&s;quetumen, Tom Hickman</HI> and <HI>Shingas</HI> told me,</P>
<P>"Brother, it is good that you have &s;tayed &s;o long with us; we love to &s;ee you, and wi&s;h to &s;ee you here longer; but &s;ince you are &s;o de&s;irous to go, you may &s;et off to morrow: <HI>Pi&s;quetumen</HI> has brought you here, and he may carry you home again: you have &s;een us, and we have talked a great deal together, which we have not done for a long time before. Now, Brother, we love you, but cannot help wondering why the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> do not make up with one another, and tell one another not to fight on our land."</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="034421_0463_0FFDA22BB1BF2738">I told them, "Brother, if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> told the <HI>French</HI> &s;o a thou|&s;and times, they never would go away. Brother, you know &s;o long as the world has &s;tood there has not been &s;uch a war. You know when the French lived on the other &s;ide, the war was there, and here we lived in peace. Con&s;ider how many thou&s;and men are killed, and how many hou&s;es are burned &s;ince the <HI>French</HI> lived here; if they had not been here it would not have been &s;o; you know we do not blame you; we blame the <HI>French;</HI> they are the cau&s;e of this war; therefore, we do not come to hurt you, but to cha&s;ti&s;e the <HI>French."</HI></P>
<P>They told me, that at the great council, held at <HI>Onondago,</HI> among the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> before the war began (<HI>Conrad Wei&s;er</HI> was there, and wrote every thing down) it was &s;aid to the <HI>Indians</HI> at the <HI>Ohio,</HI> that they &s;hould let the <HI>French</HI> alone there, and leave it entirely to the <HI>Five Nations;</HI> the <HI>Five Nations</HI> would know what to do with them. Yet &s;oon after two hundred <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> came and built <HI>Fort Duque&s;ne.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Beaver</HI> and <HI>Shingas</HI> &s;poke to <HI>Pi&s;quetumen,</HI></P>
<P>"Brother, you told us that the Governor of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> and <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> took this man out of their bo&s;oms, and put him into your bo&s;om, that you &s;hould bring him here; and you have brought him here to us; and we have &s;een and heard him; and now we give him into your bo&s;om, to bring him to the &s;ame place again, before the Governor; but do not let him quite loo&s;e; we &s;hall rejoice when we &s;hall &s;ee him here again." They de&s;ired me to &s;peak to the Governor, in their behalf, as follows:</P>
<P>"Brother, we beg you to remember our olde&s;t brother, <HI>Pi&s;que|tumen,</HI> and furni&s;h him with good cloathes, and reward him well for his trouble; for we all &s;hall look upon him when he comes back."</P>
<P>&mdash;7th. When we were ready to go, they began to council which cour&s;e we &s;hould go, to be &s;afe&s;t; and then they hunted for the hor&s;es, but could not find them; and &s;o we lo&s;t that days journey.</P>
<P>It is a trouble&s;ome cro&s;s and heavy yoke to draw this people: They can puni&s;h and &s;queeze a body's heart to the utmo&s;t. I &s;u&s;|pect the rea&s;on they kept me here &s;o long was by in&s;tigation of the <HI>French.</HI> I remember &s;omebody told me, the <HI>French</HI> told them to keep me twelve days longer, for that they were afraid I &s;hould get back too &s;oon, and give information to the general. My heart has been very heavy here, becau&s;e they kept me for no purpo&s;e. The Lord knows how they have been coun&s;elling about my life; but they did not know who was my protector and deliverer: I believe
<PB N="91" REF="034421_0464_0FFDA1496DD10CB8">
my Lord has been too &s;trong again&s;t them; my enemies have done what lies in their power.</P>
<P>&mdash;8th. We prepared for our journey on the morning, and made our&s;elves ready. There came &s;ome together and examined me what I had wrote ye&s;terday. I told them, I wondered what need they had to concern them&s;elves about my writing. They &s;aid, if they knew I had wrote about the pri&s;oners, they would not let me go out of the town. I told them what I writ was my duty to do. "Brothers, I tell you, I am not afraid of you, if there were a thou&s;and more. I have a good con&s;cience before God and man. I tell you I have wrote nothing about the pri&s;oners. I tell you, Brothers, this is not good; there's a bad &s;pirit in your heart, which breeds that jealou&s;y; and it will keep you ever in fear, that you will never get re&s;t. I beg you would pray to God, for grace to re&s;i&s;t that wicked &s;pirit, that breeds &s;uch wicked jealou&s;ies in you; which is the rea&s;on you have kept me here &s;o long. How often have I begged of you to di&s;patch me? I am a&s;hamed to &s;ee you &s;o jealous; I am not, in the lea&s;t, afraid of you. Have I not brought writings to you? and what, do you think I mu&s;t not carry &s;ome home, to the Governor? or, &s;hall I &s;hut my mouth, and &s;ay nothing? Look into your own hearts, and &s;ee if it would be right or wrong, if any body gives a &s;alutation to their friends, and it is not returned in the &s;ame way. You told me many times how kind you were to the pri&s;oners, and now you are afraid that any of them &s;hould &s;peak to me."</P>
<P>They told me, they had cau&s;e to be afraid; and then made a draught, and &s;hewed me how they were &s;urrounded with war. Then I told them, if they would be quiet, and keep at a di&s;tance, they need not fear. Then they went away, very much a&s;hamed, one after another. I told my men, that we mu&s;t make ha&s;te and go; and accordingly we &s;et off, in the afternoon, from <HI>Ku&s;hku&s;h|kee,</HI> and came ten miles.</P>
<P>&mdash;9th. We took a little foot-path hardly to be &s;een. We lo&s;t it, and went through thick bu&s;hes, till we came to a mire, which we did not &s;ee, till we were in it; and <HI>Tom Hickman</HI> fell in, and almo&s;t broke his leg. We had hard work before we could get the hor&s;e out again. The Lord helped me, that I got &s;afe from my hor&s;e. I and <HI>Pi&s;quetumen</HI> had enough to do to come through. We pa&s;&s;ed many &s;uch places: it rained all day; and we got a double portion of it, becau&s;e we received all that hung on the bu&s;hes. We were as wet as if we were &s;wimming all the day; and at night we laid our&s;elves down in a &s;wampy place to &s;leep, where we had nothing but the heavens for our covering.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="034421_0465_0FFDA1F42790DC48">&mdash;10th. We had but little to live on. <HI>Tom Hickman</HI> &s;hot a deer on the road. Every thing here, upon the <HI>Ohio,</HI> is extremely dear, much more &s;o than in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania:</HI> I gave for one di&s;h of corn four hundred and &s;ixty <HI>wampum.</HI> They told me that the Governor of <HI>fort Duque&s;ne</HI> kept a &s;tore of his own, and that all the <HI>Indians</HI> mu&s;t come and buy the goods of him; and when they come and buy, he tells them, if they will go to war, they &s;hall have as much goods as they plea&s;e. Before I &s;et off, I heard fur|ther, that a <HI>French</HI> captain who goes to all the <HI>Indian</HI> towns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was &s;ent to collect the <HI>Indians</HI> together, to attack General Forbes's army, once more, on their march.</NOTE> came to <HI>Sacunck,</HI> and &s;aid, "Children, will you not come and help your father again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h?"</HI> They an&s;wered, "Why &s;hould we go to war again&s;t our brethren? They are now our friends." "O! Children," &s;aid he, "I hope you do not own them for friends." "Yes," &s;aid they, "We do; we are their friends, and we hope they will remain ours." "O! Children, &s;aid he, you mu&s;t not believe what you have heard, and what has been told you by that man." They &s;aid to him, "Yes, we do believe him more than we do you: it was you that &s;et us again&s;t them; and we will by and by have peace with them:" and then he &s;poke not a word more, but returned to the fort. So, I hope, &s;ome good is done: prai&s;ed be the name of the Lord.</P>
<P>&mdash;11th. Being Monday, we went over <HI>Antigoc:</HI> we went down a very &s;teep hill, and our hor&s;es &s;lipt &s;o far, that I expected, every moment, they would fall heels over head. We found fre&s;h <HI>Indian</HI> tracts on the other &s;ide of the river. We cro&s;&s;ed <HI>Allegheny</HI> river, and went through the bu&s;hes upon a high hill, and &s;lept upon the &s;ide of the mountain, without fire, for fear of the ene|my. It was a cold night, and I had but a thin blanket to cover my&s;elf.</P>
<P>&mdash;12th. We made a little fire, to warm our&s;elves in the morning. Our hor&s;es began to be weary with climbing up and down the&s;e &s;teep mountains. We came this night to the top of a mountain, where we found a log-hou&s;e. Here we made a &s;mall fire, ju&s;t to boil our&s;elves a little victuals. The <HI>Indians</HI> were very much afraid, and lay with their guns and tomhocks on all night. They heard &s;omebody run and whi&s;per in the night. I &s;lept very &s;ound, and in the morning they a&s;ked me, if I was not afraid the enemy <HI>Indians</HI> would kill me. I &s;aid, "No, I am not afraid of the <HI>Indians,</HI> nor the devil him&s;elf: I fear my great Creator, God." "Aye, they &s;aid, you know you will go to a good place when you die, but we do not know that: that makes us afraid."</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="034421_0466_0FFDA23396900428">&mdash;13th. In the afternoon we twice cro&s;&s;ed <HI>Chowatin,</HI> and came to <HI>Ponche&s;tanning,</HI> an old de&s;erted <HI>Indian</HI> town, that lies on the &s;ame creek. We went through a bad &s;wamp, where were very thick &s;harp thorns, &s;o that they tore our cloaths and fle&s;h, both hands and face, to a bad degree. We had this kind of road all the day. In the evening we made a fire, and then they heard &s;omething ru&s;h, in the bu&s;hes, as though they heard &s;omebody walk. Then we went about three gun-&s;hot from our fire, and could not find a place to lie down on, for the innumerable rocks; &s;o that we were obliged to get &s;mall &s;tones to fill up the hollow places in the rocks, for our bed; but it was very unea&s;y; almo&s;t &s;hirt and &s;kin grew together. They kept watch one after another all night.</P>
<P>&mdash;14th. In the morning, I a&s;ked them what made them afraid. They &s;aid, I knew nothing; the <HI>French</HI> had &s;et a great price on my head; and they knew there was gone out a great &s;cout to lie in wait for me. We went over great mountains and a very bad road.</P>
<P>&mdash;15th. We came to <HI>Su&s;quehanna,</HI> and cro&s;&s;ed it &s;ix times, and came to <HI>Catawawe&s;hink,</HI> where had been an old <HI>Indian</HI> town. In the evening there came three <HI>Indians,</HI> and &s;aid they &s;aw two <HI>Indian</HI> tracks, which came to the place where we &s;lept, and turned back, as if to give information of us to a party; &s;o that we were &s;ure they followed us.</P>
<P>&mdash;16th and 17th. We cro&s;&s;ed the mountain.</P>
<P>&mdash;18th. Came to the <HI>Big I&s;land,</HI> where having nothing to live on, we were obliged to &s;tay to hunt.</P>
<P>&mdash;19th. We met 20 warriors, who were returning from the inhabitants, with five pri&s;oners and one &s;calp; &s;ix of them were <HI>Delawares,</HI> the re&s;t <HI>Mingoes.</HI> We &s;at down all in one ring to|gether. I informed them where I had been, and what was done; they a&s;ked me to go back a little, and &s;o I did, and &s;lept all night with them. I informed them of the particulars of the peace pro|po&s;ed; they &s;aid, "If they had known &s;o much before, they would not have gone to war. Be &s;trong; if you make a good peace, then we will bring all the pri&s;oners back again." They killed two deer, and gave me one.</P>
<P>&mdash;20th. We took leave of each other, and went on our journey, and arrived the 22d at <HI>fort Augu&s;ta,</HI> in the afternoon, very weary and hungry; but greatly rejoiced of our return from this tedious journey.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="034421_0467_0FFDA17D6087E568">There is not a prouder, or more high minded people, in them|&s;elves, than the Indians. They think them&s;elves the wi&s;e&s;t and prudente&s;t men in the world; and that they can over-power both the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> when they plea&s;e. The white people are, in their eyes, nothing at all. They &s;ay, that through their conjur|ing craft they can do what they plea&s;e, and nothing can with&s;tand them. In their way of &s;ighting they have this method, to &s;ee that they fir&s;t &s;hoot the officers and commanders; and then, they &s;ay, we &s;hall be &s;ure to have them. They al&s;o &s;ay, that if their conju|rers run through the middle of our people, no bullet can hurt them. They &s;ay too, that when they have &s;hot the commanders, the &s;oldiers will all be confu&s;ed, and will not know what to do. They &s;ay of them&s;elves, that every one of them is like a king and captain, and fights for him&s;elf. By this way they imagine they can overthrow any body of men, that may come again&s;t them. They &s;ay, "The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> people are fools; they hold their guns half man high, and then let them &s;nap; we take &s;ight and have them at a &s;hot, and &s;o do the <HI>French;</HI> they do not only &s;hoot with a bullet, but big &s;wan &s;hot." They &s;ay, the French load with a bullet and &s;ix &s;wan-&s;hot. They further &s;ay, "We take care to have the fir&s;t &s;hot at our enemies, and then they are half dead before they begin to fight."</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> are a people full of jealou&s;y, and will not ea&s;ily tru&s;t any body; and they are very ea&s;ily affronted, and brought into jealou&s;y; then afterwards they will have nothing at all to do with tho&s;e they &s;u&s;pect; and it is not brought &s;o ea&s;y out of their minds; they keep it to their graves, and leave the &s;eed of it in their children and grand children's minds; &s;o, if they can, they will revenge them&s;elves for every imagined injury. They are a very di&s;tru&s;tful people. Through their imagination and rea&s;on they think them&s;elves a thou&s;and times &s;tronger than all all other peo|ple. <HI>Fort du Que&s;ne</HI> is &s;aid to be undermined. The <HI>French</HI> have given out, that, if we overpower them, and they &s;hould die, we &s;hould certainly all die with them. When I came to the fort, the garri&s;on, it was &s;aid, con&s;i&s;ted of about one thou&s;and four hun|dred men; and I am told they will now be full three thou&s;and <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> They are almo&s;t all <HI>Canadians,</HI> and will cer|tainly meet the general before he comes to the fort, in an ambu&s;h. You may depend upon it the <HI>French</HI> will make no open field-battle, as in the old country, but lie in ambu&s;h. The <HI>Canadians</HI> are all hunters. The <HI>Indians</HI> have agreed to draw back; but how far we may give credit to their promi&s;es the Lord knows. It is the be&s;t way to be on our guard again&s;t them, as if they really could with one thou&s;and overpower eight thou&s;and.</P>

<P><HI>October</HI> 25th, 1758. HAVING received the orders of the honourable Governor <HI>Denny,</HI> I &s;et out from <HI>Ea&s;ton</HI> to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and arrived there about three o'clock in the afternoon; I was em|ployed mo&s;t of the night, in preparing my&s;elf with nece&s;&s;aries, &amp;c. for the journey.</P>

<P>&mdash;27th.

<P>After which they con&s;ulted among them&s;elves, and &s;oon re&s;olved to go with me.

We came that night to <HI>Garli&s;le</HI> and found a &s;mall hou&s;e without the fort, for the <HI>Indians</HI> to be by them&s;elves, and hired a woman to dre&s;s their victuals, which plea&s;ed them well.</P>
<P>&mdash;30th. Setting out early, we came to <HI>Shippen&s;burg,</HI> and were lodged in the fort, where the <HI>Indians</HI> had a hou&s;e to them&s;elves.</P>

other <HI>Indians."</HI>&mdash;And informed them further, they came from a treaty, which was held at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> between the <HI>Eight United Na|tions,</HI> and their confederates, and the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> in which peace was e&s;tabli&s;hed; and &s;hewed them the two me&s;&s;engers from the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> who were going, with them, to make it known to all the <HI>Indians</HI> to the we&s;tward.

<P>Nov. 1. We reached fort <HI>Littleton,</HI> in company with the <HI>Che|rokees,</HI> and were lodged, in the fort; they, and our <HI>Indians,</HI> in di&s;|tinct places; and they entertained each other with &s;tories of their warlike adventures.</P>
<P>&mdash;2d. <HI>Pe&s;quitomen</HI> &s;aid to me, "you have led us this way, through the fire; if any mi&s;chief &s;hould befal us, we &s;hall lay it entirely to you; for we think it was your doing, to bring us this way; you &s;hould have told us at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> if it was nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould go to the general."</P>
<P>I told him, "that I had informed the great men, at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> that I then thought it would be be&s;t not to let them go from thence, till they had &s;een the general's letter; and a&s;&s;ured them that it was agreeable to the general's plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>&mdash;3d. <HI>Pe&s;quitomen</HI> began to argue with captain <HI>Bull</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hays,</HI> upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, as they did with me, when I went to them with my fir&s;t me&s;&s;age; which was, "that they &s;hould tell them, whether the general would claim the land as his own, when he &s;hould drive the <HI>French</HI> away? or, whether the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> thought to &s;ettle the country? We are always jealous the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will take the land from us. Look, brother, what makes you come with &s;uch a large body of men, and make &s;uch large roads into our country; we could drive away the <HI>French</HI> our&s;elves, without your coming into our country."</P>
<P>Then I de&s;ired captain <HI>Bull</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> to be careful how they argued with the <HI>Indians;</HI> and be &s;ure to &s;ay nothing, that might affront them; for it may prove to our di&s;advantage, when we come among&s;t them. This day we came to <HI>Rays-town,</HI> and with much difficulty got a place to lodge the <HI>Indians</HI> by them&s;elves, to their &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>&mdash;4th. We intended to &s;et out, but our <HI>Indians</HI> told us, the <HI>Cherokees</HI> had de&s;ired them to &s;tay that day, as they intended to hold a council; and they de&s;ired us to read over to them the go|vernor's

<P>&mdash;5th. Ro&s;e early, and, it raining &s;martly, we a&s;ked our <HI>In|dians,</HI> if they would go; which they took time to con&s;ult about.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cherokees</HI> came and told them, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had killed about thirty of their people, for taking &s;ome hor&s;es; which they re&s;ent|ed much; and told our <HI>Indians</HI> they had better go home, than go any farther with us, le&s;t they &s;hould meet with the &s;ame. On hearing this, I told them how I had heard it happened; upon which our <HI>Indians</HI> &s;aid, they had behaved like fools, and brought the mi&s;chief on them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Pe&s;quitomen,</HI> before we went from hence, made it up with <HI>Jen|ny Frazer,</HI> and they parted good friends; and though it rained hard, we &s;et out at 10 o'clock, and got to the foot of the <HI>Alleghenny,</HI> and lodged at the fir&s;t run of water.</P>
<P>&mdash;6th. One of our hor&s;es went back; we hunted a good while for him. Then we &s;et off, and found one of the wor&s;t roads that ever was travelled until <HI>Stoney creek.</HI> Upon the road we overtook a great number of pack hor&s;es; whereon <HI>Pe&s;quitomen</HI> &s;aid, "Brother, now you &s;ee, if you had not come to us before, this road would not be &s;o &s;afe as it is; now you &s;ee, we could have de&s;troyed all this people on the road, and great mi&s;chief would have been done, if you had not &s;topt, and drawn our people back."&mdash; We were informed that the general was not yet gone to fort <HI>Du|que&s;ne,</HI> wherefore <HI>Pe&s;quitomen</HI> &s;aid, he was glad, and expre&s;&s;ed, "If I can come to our towns before the general begins the attack, I know our people will draw back, and leave the <HI>French."</HI>&mdash;We lodged this night at <HI>Stoney creek.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;7th. We aro&s;e early, and made all the ha&s;te we could on our journey; we cro&s;&s;ed the large creek, <HI>Rehempalin,</HI> near <HI>Lawrel hill.</HI> Upon this hill we overtook the artillery; and came, before &s;un &s;et, to <HI>Loyal Hanning.</HI> We were gladly received in the camp by the general, and mo&s;t of the people. We made our fire near the other <HI>Indian</HI> camps; which plea&s;ed our people. Soon after &s;ome of the officers came, and &s;poke very ra&s;hly to our <HI>Indians,</HI> in re&s;pect to their conduct to our people; at which they were much di&s;plea&s;ed, and an&s;wered as ra&s;hly, and &s;aid, "they did not under|&s;tand &s;uch u&s;age; for they were come upon a me&s;&s;age of peace; if we had a mind to war, they knew how to help them&s;elves; and that they were not afraid of us."</P>

At eleven o'clock the general called the <HI>Indians</HI> toge|ther, the <HI>Cherokees</HI> and <HI>Catawbas</HI> being pre&s;ent; he &s;pake to them in a kind and loving manner, and bid them heartily welcome to his camp, and expre&s;&s;ed his joy to &s;ee them, and de&s;ired them to give his compliments to all their kings and captains:&mdash;He de&s;ired them that had any love for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation, to withdraw from the <HI>French;</HI> for if he &s;hould find them among the <HI>French,</HI> he mu&s;t treat them as enemies, as he &s;hould advance with a large army very &s;oon, and cannot wait longer on account of the winter &s;ea|&s;on. After that he drank the king's health, and all that wi&s;h well to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation; then he drank king <HI>Beaver's, Shingas',</HI> and all the warrior's healths, and recommended us (the me&s;&s;engers) to their care; and de&s;ired them to give credit to what we &s;hould &s;ay. After that we went to another hou&s;e with the general alone; and he &s;hewed them the belt, and &s;aid, he would furni&s;h them with a writing, for both the belt and &s;tring; and after a little di&s;|cour&s;e more, our <HI>Indians</HI> parted in love, and well &s;atisfied. And we made all nece&s;&s;ary preparation for our journey.</P>
<P>&mdash;9th. Some of the colonels and chief commanders wonder|ed how I came through &s;o many difficulties, and how I could rule and bring the&s;e people to rea&s;on, making no u&s;e of gun or &s;word. I told them, it is done by no other means than by faith. Then they a&s;ked me, if I had faith to venture my&s;elf to come &s;afe through with my companions. I told them, it was in my heart to pray for them, "you know that the Lord has given many promi&s;es to his &s;ervants, and what he promi&s;es, you may depend upon, he will perform."&mdash;Then they wi&s;hed us good &s;ucce&s;s. We waited till almo&s;t noon for the writing of the general. We were e&s;corted by an hundred men, rank and file, commanded by captain <HI>Ha&s;elet;</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed through a tract of good land, about &s;ix miles on the old trading path, and came to the creek again, where there is a large fine bottom, well timbered; from thence we came upon a hill, to an advanced brea&s;t work, about ten miles from the camp, well &s;ituated for &s;trength, facing a &s;mall branch of the afore&s;aid creek; the hill is &s;teep down, perpendicular about twenty feet, on the &s;outh &s;ide; which is a great defence; and on the we&s;t &s;ide the brea&s;t-work about &s;even feet high, where we encamped that night: Our <HI>Indian</HI> companions heard that we were to part in the morning, and that twelve men were to be &s;ent with us, and the others, part of the company, to go towards fort <HI>Duque&s;ne.</HI> Our <HI>Indians</HI> de&s;ired that the captain would &s;end twenty men, in&s;tead of twelve; that if any accident &s;hould happen, they could be more able to defend them&s;elves in returning back; "for we know, &s;ay they, the enemy will follow the &s;malle&s;t party." It began to rain.
<PB N="102" REF="034421_0475_0FFDA14F75ADD628">
Within five miles from the brea&s;t-work we departed from captain <HI>Ha&s;elet;</HI> he kept the old trading path to the <HI>Ohio.</HI> Lieutenant <HI>Hays</HI> was ordered to accompany us to the <HI>Alleghenny</HI> river <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Ohio, as it is called by the Sennecas. Alleghenny is the name of the &s;ame river in the Delaware language. Both words &s;ignify the fine, or fair river.</NOTE> with fourteen men. We went the path that leads along, the <HI>Loyal Hanning</HI> creek, where there is a rich fine bottom, land well tim|bered, good &s;prings and &s;mall creeks. At four o'clock we were alarmed by three men, in <HI>Indian</HI> dre&s;s; and preparation was made on both &s;ides, for defence. <HI>I&s;aac Still</HI> &s;hewed a white token, and <HI>Pe&s;quitomen</HI> gave an <HI>Indian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lloo;</HI> after which they threw down their bundles, and ran away as fa&s;t as they could. We afterwards took up their bundles, and found that it was a &s;mall party of our men, that had been long out. We were &s;orry that we had &s;cared them; for they lo&s;t their bundles with all their food. Then, I held a conference with our <HI>Indians,</HI> and a&s;ked them, if it would not be good, to &s;end one of our <HI>Indians</HI> to <HI>Log &s;town</HI> and <HI>fort Duque&s;ne,</HI> and call the <HI>Indians</HI> from thence, before we arrive at <HI>Ku&s;hku&s;h|king.</HI> They all agreed it would not be good, as they were but me&s;|&s;engers; it mu&s;t be done by their chief men. The wolves made a terrible mu&s;ic this night.</P>
<P>&mdash;11th. We &s;tarted early, and came to the old <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> town, called <HI>Keckkeknepolin,</HI> grown up thick with weeds, briars and bu&s;hes, that we &s;carcely could get through. <HI>Pe&s;quitomen</HI> led us upon a &s;teep hill, that our hor&s;es could hardly get up; and <HI>Tho|mas Hickman's</HI> hor&s;e tumbled, and rolled down the hill like a wheel; on which he grew angry, and would go no further with us, and &s;aid, he would go by him&s;elf: It happened we found a path on the top of the hill. At three o'clock we came to <HI>Ki&s;ke|meneco,</HI> an old <HI>Indian</HI> town, a rich bottom, well timbered, good fine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> gra&s;s, well watered, and lays wa&s;te &s;ince the war be|gan. We let our hor&s;es &s;eed here, and agreed that lieutenant <HI>Hays</HI> might go back with his party; and as they were &s;hort of provi&s;ions, we, therefore, gave them a little of ours, which they took very kind of us. <HI>Thomas Hickman</HI> could find no other road, and came to us again a little a&s;hamed; we were glad to &s;ee him; and we went about three miles farther, where we made a large fire. Here the <HI>Indians</HI> looked over their pre&s;ents, and grumbled at me; they thought, if they had gone the other way by <HI>Shamokin,</HI> they would have got more. Captain Bull &s;poke in their favour again&s;t me. Then I &s;aid to them, "I am a&s;hamed to &s;ee you grumble about pre&s;ents; I thought you were &s;ent to e&s;tabli&s;h a peace." Though I confe&s;s I was not plea&s;ed that the <HI>Indians</HI> were &s;o &s;lightly fitted out from <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> as the general had nothing to
<PB N="103" REF="034421_0476_0FFDA16D93B27B00">
give them, in the critical circum&s;tances he was in, fit for their pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>&mdash;12th. Early in the morning, I &s;poke to the <HI>Indians</HI> of my company, "Brethren, you have now pa&s;&s;ed through the heart of the country back and forward, likewi&s;e through the mid&s;t of the army, without any difficulty or danger; you have &s;een and heard a great deal. When I was among you, at <HI>Alleghenny,</HI> you told me, I &s;hould not regard what the common people would &s;ay, but only hearken to the chiefs; I &s;hould take no bad &s;tories along. I did accordingly; and when I left <HI>Alleghenny</HI> I dropt all evil reports, and only carried the agreeable news, which was plea&s;ing to all that heard it. Now, brethren, I beg of you to do the &s;ame, and to drop all evil reports, which you may have heard of bad people, and only to ob&s;erve and keep what you have heard of our rulers, and the wi&s;e people, &s;o that all your young men, women and children, may rejoice at our coming to them, and may have the benefit of it."</P>
<P>They took it very kindly. After awhile they &s;poke in the fol|lowing manner to us, and &s;aid, "Brethren, when you come to <HI>Ku&s;hku&s;hking,</HI> you mu&s;t not mind the pri&s;oners, and have nothing to do with them. Mr. <HI>Po&s;t,</HI> when he was fir&s;t there, li&s;tened too much to the pri&s;oners; the <HI>Indians</HI> were almo&s;t mad with him for it, and would have confined him for it; for, they &s;aid, he had wrote &s;omething of them."</P>
<P>As we were hunting for our hor&s;es, we found <HI>Thomas Hickman</HI>'s hor&s;e dead, which rolled ye&s;terday down the hill. At one o'clock we came to the <HI>Alleghenny,</HI> to an old <HI>Shawano</HI> town, &s;ituated under a high hill on the ea&s;t, oppo&s;ite an i&s;land of about one hundred acres, very rich land, well timbered. We looked for a place to cro&s;s the river, but in vain; we then went &s;martly to work, and made a raft; we cut the wood, and carried it to the water &s;ide. The wolves and owls made a great noi&s;e in the night.</P>
<P>&mdash;13th. We got up early, and boiled &s;ome chocolate for breakfa&s;t, and then began to fini&s;h our rafts; we cloathed our&s;elves as well as we could in <HI>Indian</HI> dre&s;s; it was about two o'clock in the afternoon, before we all got over to the other &s;ide, near an old <HI>Indian</HI> town. The <HI>Indians</HI> told us, we &s;hould not call Mr. <HI>Bull, captain,</HI> their young men would be mad that we brought a warrior there. We went up a &s;teep hill, good land, to the creek <HI>Cowe|wanick,</HI> where we made our fire. They wanted to hunt for meat, and looked for a road. Captain <HI>Bull</HI> &s;hot a &s;quirrel, and broke his gun. I cut fire wood, and boiled &s;ome chocolate for &s;upper. The others came home, and brought nothing. <HI>Pe&s;quitomen</HI> wanted
<PB N="104" REF="034421_0477_0FFDA185325694D8">
to hear the writing from the general, which we read to them, to their great &s;atisfaction. This was the fir&s;t night we &s;lept in the open air. Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> took the tent along with him. We di&s;cour&s;ed a good deal of the night together.</P>
<P>&mdash;14th. We ro&s;e early, and thought to make good progre&s;s on our way. At one o'clock <HI>Thomas Hickman</HI> &s;hot a large buck; and, as our people were hungry for meat, we made our camp there, and called the water <HI>Buck run.</HI> In the evening we heard the great guns fire from <HI>fort Duque&s;ne.</HI> Whenever I looked to|wards that place, I felt a di&s;mal impre&s;&s;ion, the very place &s;eemed &s;hocking and dark. <HI>Pe&s;quitomen</HI> looked his things over, and found a white belt, &s;ent by the commi&s;&s;ioners of trade,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Per&s;ons appointed by law to manage the <HI>Indian</HI> trade, for the public; the pri|vate trade, on account of its abu&s;es, being aboli&s;hed.</NOTE> for the <HI>Indian</HI> affairs. We could find no writing concerning the belt, and did not know what was the &s;ignification thereof: They &s;eemed much con|cerned to know it.</P>
<P>&mdash;15th. We aro&s;e early, and had a good day's journey; we pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e two days through thick bu&s;hes of briars and thorns; &s;o that it was very difficult to get through. We cro&s;&s;ed the creek <HI>Paquakonink;</HI> the land is very indifferent. At twelve o'clock we cro&s;&s;ed the road from <HI>Venango</HI> to <HI>fort Duque&s;ne.</HI> We went we&s;t to|wards <HI>Ku&s;hku&s;hking,</HI> about &s;ixteen miles from the fort. We went over a large barren plain, and made our lodging by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Pe&s;quitomen</HI> told us&punc; we mu&s;t &s;end a me&s;&s;enger, to let them know of our coming, as the <HI>French</HI> live among&s;t them; he de&s;ired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tring of wampum; I gave him three hundred and fifty.

In di&s;cour&s;e, Mr. Bull told the <HI>Indians,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould let all the pri&s;oners &s;tay among&s;t them, that liked to &s;tay.</P>
<P>&mdash;16th. We met two <HI>Indians</HI> on the road, and &s;at down with them to dinner. They informed us that no body was at home, at <HI>Ku&s;hku&s;hking;</HI> that one hundred and &s;ixty, from that town, were gone to war again&s;t our party. We cro&s;&s;ed the above men|tioned creek; good land, but hilly. Went down a long valley to <HI>Beaver</HI> creek, through old <HI>Ku&s;hku&s;hking,</HI> a large &s;pot of land, about three miles long; they both went with us to the town; one of them rode before us, to let the people in the town know of our coming; we found there but two men, and &s;ome women. Tho&s;e, that were at home, received us kindly. <HI>Pe&s;quitomen</HI> de|&s;ired us to read the me&s;&s;age to them that were there.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="034421_0478_0FFDA16F82613508">&mdash;17th. There were five <HI>Frenchmen</HI> in the town; the re&s;t were gone to war. We held a council with <HI>Delaware George,</HI> delivered him the &s;tring and pre&s;ents, that were &s;ent to him; and informed him of the general's &s;entiments, and what he de&s;ired of them; upon which he agreed, and complied to go with Mr. <HI>Bull,</HI> to the general. Towards night <HI>Keckkenepalin</HI> came home from the war, and told us the di&s;agreeable news, that they had fallen in with that party, that had guided us; they had killed Lieutenant <HI>Hays,</HI> and four more, and took five pri&s;oners, the others got clear off. They had a &s;kirmi&s;h with them within twelve miles of <HI>fort Du|que&s;ne.</HI> Further he told us, that one of the captives was to be burnt, which grieved us. By the pri&s;oners they were informed of our arrival; on which they concluded to leave the <HI>French,</HI> and to hear what news we brought them. In the evening they brought a pri&s;oner to town. We called the <HI>Indians</HI> together, that were at home, and explained the matter to them, and told them, as their own people had de&s;ired the general to give them a guide to conduct them &s;afe home, and by a misfortune, your people have fallen in with this party, and killed five and taken five pri&s;oners; and we are now informed that one of them is to be burnt; "Con&s;ider, my brethren, if you &s;hould give us a guide, to bring us &s;afe on our way home, and our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould fall in with you, how hard you would take it."</P>
<P>They &s;aid, "Brother, it is a hard matter, and we are &s;orry it hath happened <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">." I an&s;wered, "Let us therefore &s;pare no pains to relieve them from any cruelty." We could &s;carce find a me&s;|&s;enger, that would undertake to go to <HI>Sawcung,</HI> where the pri&s;oner was to be bunt. We promi&s;ed to one named <HI>Compa&s;s,</HI> 500 black wampum, and Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> gave him a &s;hirt and a dollar, on which he promi&s;ed to go. We &s;ent him as a me&s;&s;enger. By a &s;tring of wampum I &s;poke the&s;e words, "Brethren, con&s;ider the me&s;&s;engers are come home with good news, and three of your brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with them. We de&s;ire you would pity your own young men, women and children, and u&s;e no hard&s;hips towards the cap|tives, as having been guiding our party."</P>
<P>Afterwards the warriors informed us, that their de&s;ign had not been to go to war, but that they had a mind to go to the general, and &s;peak with him; and on the road the <HI>French</HI> made a divi&s;ion among them, that they could not agree; after which they were di&s;covered by the <HI>Cherokees</HI> and <HI>Catawbas,</HI> who &s;led, and left their bundles, where they found an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colour. So <HI>Kekeu&s;cung</HI> told them he would go before them to the general, if they would fol|low low him; but they would not agree to it; and the <HI>French</HI> per|&s;uaded them to fall upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Loyal-hanning;</HI> they ac|cordingly
<PB N="106" REF="034421_0479_0FFDA19E0D578AE8">
did, and as they were driven back, they fell in with that party, that guided us, which they did not know. They &s;eemed very &s;orry for it.</P>
<P>&mdash;18th. Captain <HI>Bull</HI> acted as commander, without letting us know any thing, or communicating with us. He and <HI>George</HI> re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eved a pri&s;oner from the warriors, by what means I do not kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w. When the warriors were met, he then called us fir&s;t to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and to hear what they had to &s;ay. The <HI>Indian</HI> that de|livered the pri&s;oner to <HI>Bull</HI> and <HI>George,</HI> &s;poke as follows:</P>
<P>"My brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are at &s;uch a di&s;tance from us, as if they were under ground, that I cannot hear them. I am very glad to hear from you &s;uch good news; and I am very &s;orry that it happened &s;o, that I went to war. Now I let the general know, he &s;hould con&s;ider his young men, and if you &s;hould have any of us, to &s;et them at liberty, &s;o as we do to you.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Pe&s;quitomen</HI> &s;aid, "As the Governor gave the&s;e three me&s;&s;engers into my bo&s;om, &s;o I now likewi&s;e, by this &s;tring of wampum, give <HI>Bull</HI> into <HI>Delaware George</HI>'s bo&s;om, to bring him &s;afe to the general." Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> &s;at down with the pri&s;oner, who gave him &s;ome intelligence in writing; at which the <HI>Indians</HI> grew very jealous, and a&s;ked them what they had to write there? I wrote a letter to the general by Mr. <HI>Bull.</HI> In the afternoon Mr. <HI>Bull, Delaware George,</HI> and <HI>Ke&s;k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">epalen</HI> &s;et out for the camp. To|wards night they brought in another pri&s;oner. When Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> and company were gone, the <HI>Indians</HI> took the &s;ame pri&s;oner, whom Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> had relieved, and bound him and carried him to another town, without our knowledge. I a thou&s;and times wi&s;hed Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> had never meddled in the affair, fearing they would ex|ceedingly puni&s;h, and bring the pri&s;oner to confe&s;&s;ion of the con|tents of the writing.</P>
<P>&mdash;19th. A great many of the warriors came home. The <HI>French</HI> had infu&s;ed bad notions into the <HI>Indians,</HI> by means of the letters, they found upon Lieutenant <HI>Hays,</HI> who was killed, which they fal&s;ely interpreted to them, viz. That, in one letter it was wrote, that the general &s;hould do all that was in his power to con|quer the <HI>French,</HI> and, in the mean time the me&s;&s;engers to the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould do their utmo&s;t to draw the <HI>Indians</HI> back, and keep them together in conferences, till he, the general, had made a conque&s;t of the <HI>French,</HI> and afterwards he &s;hould fall upon all <HI>Indians,</HI> and de&s;troy them. And, that, if we &s;hould lo&s;e our lives, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would carry on the war, &s;o long as an <HI>Indian,</HI> or <HI>Frenchman</HI> was alive. Thereupon the French &s;aid to the <HI>Indians;</HI></P>

One of the <HI>Indian</HI> captains &s;poke to the <HI>French</HI> and &s;aid, "To be &s;ure it would offend us, if you &s;hould offer to knock them on the head.

This afforded a melancholy pro&s;pect. <HI>I&s;aac Still</HI> was him&s;elf du|bious of our lives. We did not let Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> know of the dang|er. I &s;aid, "As God hath &s;topped the mouth of the lions, that they could not devour <HI>Daniel,</HI> &s;o he will pre&s;erve us from their fury, and bring us through." I had a di&s;cour&s;e with Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> concerning our me&s;&s;age, and begged him he would pray to God for grace and wi&s;dom, that he would grant us peace among this people. We will remain in &s;tillne&s;s, and not look to our own credit. We are in the &s;ervice of our king and country. This people are rebellious in heart; now we are here to reconcile them again to the General, Governor, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation; to turn them again from their errors. And I wi&s;hed that God would grant us his grace, whereby we may do it; which I hope and believe he will do. Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> took it to heart and was convinced of all; which much rejoiced me. I begged <HI>I&s;aac Still</HI> to watch over him&s;elf, and not to be di&s;couraged; for I hoped the &s;torm would &s;oon pa&s;s by.</P>
<P>In the afternoon all the captains gathered together in the middle town; they &s;ent for us, and de&s;ired we &s;hould give them informa|tion of our me&s;&s;age. Accordingly we did. We read the me&s;&s;age with great &s;atisfaction to them. It was a great plea&s;ure both to them and us. The number of captains and coun&s;ellors were &s;ix|teen. In the evening me&s;&s;engers arrived from <HI>fort Duque&s;ne,</HI> with a &s;tring of wampum from the commander; upon which they all came together in the hou&s;e where we lodged. The me&s;&s;engers delivered their &s;tring, with the&s;e words from their father, the <HI>French</HI> King:</P>
<P>"My children, come to me, and hear what I have to &s;ay. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are coming with an army to de&s;troy both you and me. I there|fore de&s;ire you immediately, my children, to ha&s;ten with all the young men; we will drive the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and de&s;troy them. I, as a father, will tell you always what is be&s;t." He laid the &s;tring before one of the captains. After a little conver&s;ation, the captain &s;tood up
<PB N="109" REF="034421_0482_0FFDA18A32480E18">
and &s;aid; "I have ju&s;t heard &s;omething of our brethren the <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> which plea&s;eth me much better. I will not go. Give it to the others, may be they will go." The me&s;&s;enger took up again the &s;tring and &s;aid, "He won't go, he has heard of the <HI>Engli&s;h."</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>E. I.</HI> He has li&s;tened to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> me&s;&s;ages.</NOTE> Then all cried out, "yes, yes, we have heard from the <HI>Engli&s;h."</HI> He then threw the &s;tring to the other fire place, where the other captains were; but they kicked it from one to another, as if it was a &s;nake. Captain <HI>Peter</HI> took a &s;tick, and with it &s;lung the &s;tring from one end of the room to the other,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Kicking the &s;tring about, and throwing it with a &s;tick, not touching it with their hands, were marks of di&s;like of the me&s;&s;age, that accompanied it.</NOTE> and &s;aid, "Give it to the <HI>French</HI> captain, and let him go with his young men; he boa&s;ted much of his fighting; now let us &s;ee his fighting. We have often ventured our lives for him; and had hardly a loaf of bread, when we came to him; and now he thinks we &s;hould jump to &s;erve him." Then we &s;aw the <HI>French</HI> captain mortified to the uttermo&s;t; he looked as pale as death. The <HI>Indians</HI> di&s;cour&s;ed and joked till midnight; and the <HI>French</HI> captain &s;ent me&s;&s;engers at midnight to <HI>fort Duque&s;ne.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;21&s;t. We were informed that the general was within twenty miles of <HI>fort Duque&s;ne.</HI> As the <HI>Indians</HI> were afraid the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would come over the river <HI>Ohio,</HI> I &s;poke with &s;ome of the captains, and told them that, "I &s;uppo&s;ed the general intended to &s;urround the <HI>French,</HI> and therefore mu&s;t come to this &s;ide the river; but we a&s;&s;ure you that he will not come to your towns to hurt you." I begged them to let the <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> at <HI>Logstown,</HI> know it, and gave them four &s;trings of 300 wampum, with this me&s;&s;age; "Brethren, we are arrived with good news, waiting for you; we de&s;ire you to be &s;trong, and remember the ancient friend&s;hip your grandfa|thers had with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> We wi&s;h you would remember it, and pity your young men, women and children, and keep away from the <HI>French;</HI> and if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould come to &s;urround the <HI>French,</HI> be not afraid. We a&s;&s;ure you they won't hurt you,"</P>
<P>&mdash;22d. <HI>Kittiu&s;kund</HI> came home, and &s;ent for us, being very glad to &s;ee us. He informed us, the general was within fifteen miles of the <HI>French fort;</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> had uncovered their hou&s;es, and laid the roofs round the fort to &s;et it on fire, and made ready to go off, and would demoli&s;h the fort, and let the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have the bare ground; &s;aying; "they are not able to build a &s;trong fort this winter; and we will be early enough in the &s;pring to de&s;troy them. We will come with &s;eventeen nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> and a great many <HI>French,</HI> and build a &s;tone fort."</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="034421_0483_0FFDA151371A04A0">The <HI>Indians</HI> danced round the fire till midnight, for joy of their brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> coming. There went &s;ome &s;couting parties towards the army. Some of the captains told me, that <HI>Shamokin Daniel,</HI> who came with me in my former journey, had fairly &s;old me to the <HI>French;</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> had been very much di&s;plea&s;ed, that the <HI>Indians</HI> had brought me away.</P>
<P>&mdash;23d. The <HI>liar</HI> rai&s;ed a &s;tory, as if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were divided into three bodies, to come on this &s;ide the river. They told us the <HI>Cayugas,</HI> that came with us, had &s;aid &s;o. We told the <HI>Cayu|gas</HI> of it; on which they called the other <HI>Indians</HI> together; denied that they ever &s;aid &s;o; and &s;aid, they were &s;ent to this place from the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> to tell them to do their be&s;t endeavors to &s;end the <HI>French</HI> off from this country; and when that was done, they would go and tell the general to go back over the mountains.</P>
<P>I &s;ee the <HI>Indians</HI> concern them&s;elves very much about the affair of land; and are continually jealous, and afraid the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will take their land. I told them to be &s;till and content them&s;elves, "for there are &s;ome chiefs of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> with the army; they will &s;ettle the affair, as they are the chief owners of the land; and it will be well for you to come and &s;peak with the general your|&s;elves."</P>
<P><HI>I&s;aac Still</HI> a&s;ked the <HI>French</HI> captain, whether it was true, that <HI>Daniel</HI> had &s;old me to the <HI>French?</HI> He owned it, and &s;aid, I was theirs, they had bought me fairly; and, if the <HI>Indians</HI> would give them leave, he would take me.</P>
<P>&mdash;24th. We hanged out the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> flag, in &s;pite of the <HI>French;</HI> on which our pri&s;oners folded their hands, in hopes that their redemption was nigh, looking up to God, which melted my heart in tears, and prayers to God, to hear their prayers, and change the times, and the &s;ituation, which our pri&s;oners are in, and under which they groan. "O Lord, &s;aid they, when will our redemp|tion come, that we &s;hall be delivered, and return home?"&mdash;And if any accident happeneth, which the <HI>Indians</HI> di&s;like, the pri&s;oners all tremble with fear, &s;aying, "Lord, what will become of us, and what will be the end of our lives?" So that they often wi&s;h them&s;elves rather under the ground, than in this life. King Beaver came home, and called us to his hou&s;e, and &s;aluted us in a friend|ly manner; which we, in like manner, did to him. Afterwards I &s;poke by four &s;trings of 350 wampum, and &s;aid, as followeth:</P>
<P>"I have a &s;alutation to you, and all your people, from the ge|neral, the governor, and many other gentlemen. Brother, it plea&s;es me that the day is come to &s;ee you and your people. We have warmed our&s;elves by your fire, and waited for you, and
<PB N="111" REF="034421_0484_0FFDA1A0B75CC678">
thank you, that you did come home. We have good news of great importance; which we hope will make you, and all your people's hearts glad. By the&s;e &s;trings I de&s;ire you would be plea&s;ed to call all your kings and captains, from all the towns and nations; &s;o that they all may hear us, and have the benefit thereof, while they live, and their children after them."</P>
<P>Then he &s;aid, "As &s;oon as I heard of your coming, I ro&s;e up directly to come to you." Then there came another me&s;&s;age, which called me to another place, where &s;ix kings of &s;ix nations were met together. I &s;ent them word, they &s;hould &s;it together a while, and &s;moke their pipes, and I would come to them. King Beaver &s;aid further,</P>
<P>"Brother, it plea&s;eth me to hear that you brought &s;uch good news; and my heart rejoices already at what you &s;aid to me. It rejoices me that I have now heard of you." I &s;aid, "Brother, you did well, that you fir&s;t came here, before you went to the kings; as the good news we brought is to all nations, from the ri&s;ing of the &s;un to the going down of the &s;ame; that want to be in peace and friend&s;hip with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> So it will give them &s;atisfaction, when they hear it." The <HI>French</HI> captain told us, that they would demoli&s;h the fort; and he thought the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would be to-day at the place.</P>
<P>&mdash;25th <HI>Shingas</HI> came home, and &s;aluted us in a friendly man|ner, and &s;o did <HI>Beaver,</HI> in our hou&s;e; and then they told us, they would hear our me&s;&s;age; and we perceived that the <HI>French</HI> captain had an inclination to hear it. We called <HI>Beaver</HI> and <HI>Shin|gas,</HI> and informed them, that all the nations, at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> had agreed with the governor, that every thing &s;hould be kept &s;ecret from the ears and eyes of the <HI>French.</HI> He &s;aid, "it was no matter, they were beaten already. It is good news, and if he would &s;ay any thing, we would tell him what friend&s;hip we have together." Accordingly they met together, and the <HI>French</HI> captain was pre|&s;ent. The number con&s;i&s;ted of about fifty.</P>
<P>King <HI>Beaver</HI> fir&s;t &s;poke to his men, "Hearken, all you captains and warriors, here are our brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> I wi&s;h that you may give attention, and take notice of what they &s;ay. As it is for our good, that there may an everla&s;ting peace be e&s;tabli&s;hed, although there is a great deal of mi&s;chief done, if it plea&s;eth God to help us, we may live in peace again."</P>
<P>Then I began to &s;peak by four &s;trings to them, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Brethren, being come here to &s;ee you, I perceive your bodies are all &s;tained with blood, and ob&s;erve tears and &s;orrows in your eyes: With this &s;tring I clean your body from blood, and wipe
<PB N="112" REF="034421_0485_0FFDA1B6D6968438">
and anoint your eyes with the healing oil, &s;o that you may &s;ee your brethren clearly. And as &s;o many &s;torms have blown &s;ince we la&s;t &s;aw one another, and we are at &s;uch a di&s;tance from you, that you could not rightly hear us as yet, I, by this &s;tring, take a &s;oft feather, and with that good oil, our grandfathers u&s;ed, open and clear your ears, &s;o that you may both hear and under&s;tand what your brethren have to &s;ay to you. And by the&s;e &s;trings I clear your throat from the du&s;t, and take all the bitterne&s;s out of your heart, and clear the pa&s;&s;age from the heart to the throat, that you may &s;peak freely with your brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> from the heart."</P>
<P>Then <HI>I&s;aac Still</HI> gave the pipe, &s;ent by the <HI>Friends</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Quakers</HI> of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> who fir&s;t &s;et on &s;oot the&s;e negociations of peace; and for whom the <HI>Indians</HI> have always had a great regard.</NOTE>, filled with tobacco, and handed round, after their cu&s;tom, and &s;aid:</P>
<P>"Brethren, here is the pipe, which your grandfathers u&s;ed to &s;moke with, when they met together in councils of peace. And here is &s;ome of that good tobacco, prepared for our grandfathers from God:&mdash;When you &s;hall ta&s;te of it, you &s;hall feel it through all your body; and it will put you in remembrance of the good councils, your grandfathers u&s;ed to hold with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> your brethren, and that ancient friend&s;hip, they had together."</P>
<P>King <HI>Beaver</HI> ro&s;e, and thanked us fir&s;t, that we had cleaned his body from the blood, and wiped the tears and &s;orrow from his eyes, and opened his ears, &s;o that now he could well hear and un|der&s;tand. Likewi&s;e he returned thanks for the <HI>pipe and tobacco,</HI> that we brought, which our grandfathers u&s;ed to &s;moke. He &s;aid, &mdash;"When I ta&s;ted that good tobacco, I felt it all through my body, and it made me all over well."</P>
<P>Then we delivered the me&s;&s;ages, as followeth:</P>
<P>Governor <HI>Denny's</HI> an&s;wer to the me&s;&s;age of the <HI>Ohio Indians,</HI> brought by <HI>Frederick Po&s;t, Pe&s;quitomen</HI> and <HI>Thomas Hickman.</HI></P>
<P>"By this &s;tring, my <HI>Indian</HI> brethren of the United Nations and <HI>Delawares,</HI> join with me, in requiring of the <HI>Indian</HI> councils, to which the&s;e following me&s;&s;ages &s;hall be pre&s;ented, to keep every thing private from the eyes and ears of the <HI>French."</HI> A &s;tring.</P>
<P>"Brethren, we received your me&s;&s;age by <HI>Pe&s;quitomen</HI> and <HI>Fre|derick Po&s;t,</HI> and thank you for the care you have taken of our me&s;|&s;enger of peace, and that you have put him in your bo&s;om, and protected him again&s;t our enemy, <HI>Onontio,</HI> and his children, and &s;ent him &s;afe back to our council fire, by the &s;ame man, that re|ceived him from us."

<P>"From my camp at <HI>Loyalhannon,</HI> Nov. 9, 1758."</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;ages plea&s;ed, and gave &s;atisfaction to all the hearers, except the <HI>French</HI> captain. He &s;hook his head with bitter grief, and often changed his countenance. <HI>I&s;aac Still</HI> ran down the <HI>French</HI> captain with great boldne&s;s, and pointed at him &s;aying, "There he &s;its." Afterwards <HI>Shingas</HI> ro&s;e up and &s;aid:</P>
<P>"Brethren, now we have rightly heard and under&s;tood you, it plea&s;eth me and all the young men, that hear it; we &s;hall think of it, and take it into due con&s;ideration; and when we have con&s;ider|ed it well, then we will give you an an&s;wer, and &s;end it to all the towns and nations, as you de&s;ired us."</P>
<P>We thanked them and wi&s;hed them good &s;ucce&s;s in their under|taking; and wi&s;hed it might have the &s;ame effect upon all other nations, that may hereafter hear it, as it had on them. We went a little out of the hou&s;e. In the mean time <HI>I&s;aac Still</HI> demanded the letter, which the <HI>French</HI> had fal&s;ely interpreted, that it might be read in public. Then they called us back, and I, <HI>Frederick Po&s;t,</HI> found it was my own letter, I had wrote to the general. I therefore &s;tood up, and read it, which I&s;aac interpreted. The <HI>In|dians</HI> were well plea&s;ed, and took it as if it was written to them; thereupon they all &s;aid; "We always thought the <HI>French</HI> report

of the letter was a lie; they always deceived us:" Pointing at the <HI>French</HI> captain; who, bowing down his head, turned quite pale, and could look no one in the face. All the <HI>Indians</HI> began to mock and laugh at him; he could hold it no longer, and went out. Then the <HI>Cayuga</HI> chief delivered a &s;tring, in the name of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> with the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"Cou&s;ins, hear what I have to &s;ay; I &s;ee you are &s;orry, and the tears &s;tand in your eyes. I would open your ears, and clear your eyes from tears, &s;o that you may &s;ee, and hear what your uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> have to &s;ay.

<P>Delivered four &s;trings.</P>
<P>Then he &s;hewed to them a &s;tring from the <HI>Cherokees,</HI> with the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"Nephews, we let you know, that we are exceeding glad that there is &s;uch a firm friend&s;hip e&s;tabli&s;hed, on &s;o good a foundation, with &s;o many nations, that it will la&s;t for ever; and, as the <HI>Six Nations</HI> have agreed with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;o we wi&s;h that you may lay hold of the &s;ame friend&s;hip.

<P>Then the council broke up. After a little while me&s;&s;engers arrived, and <HI>Beaver</HI> came into our hou&s;e, and gave us the plea&s;ure to hear, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had the field, and that the <HI>French</HI> had demoli&s;hed and burnt the place entirely, and went off; that the commander is gone with two hundred men to <HI>Venango,</HI> and the re&s;t gone down the river in battoes, to the lower <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> town, with an intention to build a fort there; they were &s;een ye&s;terday pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Sawcung.</HI></P>
<P>We ended this day with plea&s;ure and great &s;atisfaction on both &s;ides: the <HI>Cayuga</HI> chief &s;aid, he would &s;peak further to them to|morrow.</P>
<P>&mdash;26th. We met together about ten o'clock. Fir&s;t, King <HI>Beaver</HI> addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the <HI>Cayuga</HI> chief, and &s;aid;</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="034421_0491_0FFDA1CD97A5B9E8">"My uncles, as it is cu&s;tomary to an&s;wer one another, &s;o I thank you, that you took &s;o much notice of your cou&s;ins, and that you have wiped the tears from our eyes, and cleaned our bodies from the blood; when you &s;poke to me I &s;aw my&s;elf all over bloody; and &s;ince you cleaned me I feel my&s;elf quite plea&s;ant through my whole body, and I can &s;ee the &s;un &s;hine clear over us."</P>
<P>Delivered four &s;trings.</P>
<P>He &s;aid further, "As you took &s;o much pains, and came a great way through the bu&s;hes, I, by this &s;tring, clean you from the &s;weat, and clean the du&s;t out of your throat, &s;o that you may &s;peak what you have to &s;ay from your brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and our uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> to your cou&s;ins, I am ready to hear."</P>
<P>Then <HI>Petiniontonka,</HI> the <HI>Cayuga</HI> chief, took the belt with eight diamonds,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Diamond figures, formed by beads of wampum, of different colours.</NOTE> and &s;aid;</P>
<P>"Cou&s;ins, take notice of what I have to &s;ay; we let you know what agreement we have made with our brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> We had almo&s;t &s;lipt and dropt the chain of friend&s;hip with our brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> now we let you know that we have renew|ed the peace and friend&s;hip with our brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and we have made a new agreement with them.

<P>Then he explained to them the eight diamonds, on the belt, &s;ignifying the five united nations, and the three younger nations, which join them: the&s;e all united with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Then he proceeded thus:</P>
<P>"Brethren," (delivering a belt with eight diamonds, the &s;econd belt) "we hear that you did not &s;it right; and when I came I found you in a moving po&s;ture, ready to jump towards the &s;un|&s;et; &s;o we will &s;et you at ea&s;e, and quietly down, that you may &s;it well at <HI>Ku&s;hku&s;hking;</HI> and we de&s;ire you to be &s;trong; and if you will be &s;trong, your women and children will &s;ee from day to day the light &s;hining more over them; and our children and grand

<P>In the evening the devil made a general di&s;turbance, to hinder them in their good di&s;po&s;ition. It was reported they &s;aw three <HI>Catawba Indians</HI> in their town; and they roved about all that cold night, in great fear and confu&s;ion. When I con&s;ider with what tyranny and power the prince of this world rules over this people, it breaks my heart over them; and I wi&s;h that God would have mercy upon them, and that their redemption may draw nigh, and open their eyes, that they may &s;ee what bondage they are in, and deliver them from the evil.</P>
<P>&mdash;27th. We waited all the day for an an&s;wer. <HI>Beaver</HI> came and told us, "They were bu&s;y all the day long," He &s;aid, "It is a great matter, and wants much con&s;ideration. We are three tribes, which mu&s;t &s;eparately agree among our&s;elves; it takes time before we hear each agreement, and the particulars thereof." He de&s;ired us to read our me&s;&s;age once more to them in private; we told them, we were at their &s;ervice at any time; and then we ex|plained him the whole again. There arrived a me&s;&s;enger from <HI>Sawcung,</HI> and informd us that four of their people were gone to our camp, to &s;ee what the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were about; and that one of them climbing upon a tree was di&s;covered by falling down; and then our people &s;poke to them; three re&s;olved to go to the other &s;ide, and one came back and brought the news, which plea&s;ed the company. Some of the captains and coun&s;ellors were together; they &s;aid, that the <HI>French</HI> would build a &s;trong fort, at the lower <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> town. I an&s;wered them, "Brethren, if you &s;uffer the French to build a fort there, you mu&s;t &s;uffer likewi&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to come and de&s;troy the place; <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will follow the <HI>French,</HI> and pur&s;ue them, let it co&s;t whatever it will; and wherever the <HI>French</HI> &s;ettle, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will follow and de&s;troy them."</P>
<P>They &s;aid, "We think the &s;ame, and would endeavour to prevent it, if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> only would go back, after having drove away the <HI>French,</HI> and not &s;ettle there." I &s;aid, "I can tell you no cer|tainty in this affair; it is be&s;t for you to go with us to the general, and &s;peak with him. So much I know, that they only want to e&s;tabli&s;h a trade with you; and you know your&s;elves that you can|not do without being &s;upplied with &s;uch goods as you &s;tand in need of; but, brethren, be a&s;&s;ured you mu&s;t entirely quit the <HI>French,</HI> and have no communication with them, el&s;e they will al|ways

breed di&s;turbance and confu&s;ion among&s;t you, and per&s;uade your young people to go to war again&s;t our brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h."</HI></P>
<P>I &s;poke with them further about <HI>Venango,</HI> and &s;aid, "I believed the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would go there, if they &s;uffered the <HI>French</HI> longer to live there. This &s;peech had much influence on them, and they &s;aid; "We are convinced of all that you have &s;aid; it will be &s;o." I found them inclined to &s;end off the <HI>French</HI> from <HI>Venango;</HI> but they wanted fir&s;t to know the di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and not to &s;uffer the <HI>French</HI> to build any where.</P>
<P>&mdash;28th. King <HI>Beaver</HI> aro&s;e early before the break of day, and bid all his people a good morning, de&s;ired them to ri&s;e early and prepare victuals; for they had to an&s;wer their brethren, the <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> and their uncles, and therefore they &s;hould be in a good humour and di&s;po&s;ition. At ten o'clock they met together; <HI>Bea|ver</HI> addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his people, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Take notice all you young men and warriors to what we an|&s;wer now: it is three days &s;ince we heard our brethren, the <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> and our uncles; and what we have heard of both is very good; and we are all much plea&s;ed with what we have heard. Our uncles have made an agreement, and peace is e&s;tabli&s;hed with our brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and they have &s;hook hands with them; and we likewi&s;e agree in the peace and friend&s;hip, they have e&s;tabli&s;hed be|tween them." Then he &s;poke to the <HI>French</HI> captain <HI>Canaquais,</HI> and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"You may hear what I an&s;wer; it is good news, that we have heard. I have not made my&s;elf a king. My uncles have made me like a queen, that I always &s;hould mind what is good and right, and whatever I agree with, they will a&s;&s;i&s;t me, and help me through. Since the warriors came among&s;t us, I could not follow that which is good and right; which has made me heavy; and &s;ince it is my duty to do that which is good, &s;o I will endea|vour to do and to &s;peak what is good, and not let my&s;elf be di&s;|turbed by the warriors."</P>
<P>Then he &s;poke to the <HI>Mingoes,</HI> and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"My uncles, hear me: It is two days &s;ince you told me, that you have made peace and friend&s;hip, and &s;hook hands with our brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I am really very much plea&s;ed with what you told me; and I join with you in the &s;ame; and, as you &s;aid, I &s;hould let the <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> and <HI>Delamattanoes</HI> know of the agree|ment, you have made with our brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I took it to heart, and &s;hall let them know it very &s;oon."</P>
<P>He delivered a &s;tring.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="034421_0494_0FFEA8102A9FAEA0">"Look now, my uncles, and hear what your cou&s;ins &s;ay: you have &s;poke the day before ye&s;terday to me. I have heard you. You told me, you would &s;et me at <HI>Ku&s;hku&s;hking</HI> ea&s;y down. I took it to heart; and I &s;hall do &s;o, and be &s;till, and lay my&s;elf ea&s;y down, and keep my match-coat clo&s;e to my brea&s;t. You told me, you will let me know in the next &s;pring, what to do; &s;o I will be &s;till, and wait to hear from you."</P>
<P>Gave him a belt.</P>
<P>Then he turned him&s;elf to us, and gave us the following an|&s;wers. Fir&s;t, to the general;</P>
<P>"Brother, by the&s;e &s;trings I would de&s;ire, in a mo&s;t kind and friendly manner, you would be plea&s;ed to hear me what I have to &s;ay, as you are not far off.</P>
<P>"Brother, now you told me you have heard of that good agreement, that has been agreed to, at the treaty at <HI>Ea&s;ton;</HI> and that you have put your hands to it, to &s;trengthen it, &s;o that it may la&s;t for ever. Brother, you have told me, that after you have come to hear it, you have taken it to heart, and then you &s;ent it to me, and let me know it. Brother, I would de&s;ire you would be plea&s;ed to hear me, and I would tell you, in a mo&s;t &s;oft, lov|ing and friendly manner, to go back over the mountain, and to &s;tay there; for, if you will do that, I will u&s;e it for an argument, to argue with other nations of <HI>Indians.</HI> Now, brother, you have told me you have made a road clear, from the &s;un-&s;et to our fir&s;t old council fire, at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and therefore I &s;hould fear no|thing, and come into that road. Brother, after the&s;e far <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hall come to hear of that good and wide road, that you have laid out for us, then they will turn and look at the road, and &s;ee no|thing in the way; and that is the rea&s;on, that maketh me tell you to go back over the mountain again, and to &s;tay there; for then the road will be clear, and nothing in the way."</P>
<P>Then he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> as follows;</P>
<P>"Brother, give good attention to what I am going to &s;ay; for I &s;peak from my heart; and think nothing the lo&s;s of it, though the &s;trings be &s;mall.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Important matters &s;hould be accompanied with large &s;trings, or bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ometimes&punc; &s;ufficient quantity of wampum is not at hand.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Brother, I now tell you what I have heard from you is quite agreeable to my mind; and I love to hear you. I tell you likewi&s;e, that all the chief men of <HI>Allegheny</HI> are well plea&s;ed with what you have &s;aid to us; and all my young men, women and children, that

<P>"Brother, you tell me that all the Governors of the &s;everal provinces have agreed to a well e&s;tabli&s;hed and everla&s;ting peace with the <HI>Indians;</HI> and you likewi&s;e tell me, that my uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and my brethren, the <HI>Dalawares,</HI> and &s;everal other tribes of <HI>Indians</HI> join with you in it, to e&s;tabli&s;h it, &s;o that it may be everla&s;ting; you likewi&s;e tell me, you have all agreed on a treaty of peace to la&s;t for ever; and for the&s;e rea&s;ons I tell you, I am plea&s;ed with what you have told me.</P>
<P>"Brother, I am heartily plea&s;ed to hear that you never let &s;lip the chain of friend&s;hip out of your hands, which our grandfathers had between them, &s;o that they could agree as brethren and friends in any thing.</P>
<P>"Brother, as you have been plea&s;ed to let me know of that good and de&s;irable agreement, that you and my uncles and bre|thren have agreed to, at the treaty of peace, I now tell you I heartily join and agree in it, and to it; and now I de&s;ire you to go on &s;teadily in that great and good work, you have taken in hand; and I will do as you de&s;ire me to do; that is, to let the other tribes of <HI>Indians</HI> know it, and more e&s;pecially my uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> my grandchildren, and all other na|tions, &s;ettled to the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>"Brother, I de&s;ire you not to be out of patience, as I have a great many friends at a great di&s;tance; and I &s;hall u&s;e my be&s;t en|deavours to let them know it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and as &s;oon as I obtain their an&s;wer, &s;hall let you know it."</P>
<P>Then he gave &s;ix &s;trings all white.</P>
<P>In the evening arrived a me&s;&s;enger from <HI>Sackung, Netodwehe|ment,</HI> and de&s;ired they &s;hould make all the ha&s;te to di&s;patch us, and we &s;hould come to <HI>Sackung;</HI> for, as they did not know what is become of tho&s;e three, that went to our camp, they were afraid the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would keep them, till they heard what was become of us, their me&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>&mdash;29th. Before day break <HI>Beaver</HI> and <HI>Shingas</HI> came, and called us into their council. They had been all the night together. They &s;aid; "Brethren, now is the day coming, you will &s;et off from here. It is a good many days &s;ince we heard you; and what we have heard is very plea&s;ing and agreeable to us. It rejoices all our hearts; and all our young men, women and children, that are capable to under&s;tand, are really very well plea&s;ed with what they have heard; it is &s;o agreeable to us, that we never received &s;uch good news before; we think God had made it &s;o; he pities us,

and has mercy on us. And now, brethren, you de&s;ire that I &s;hould let it be known to all other nations; and I &s;hall let them know very &s;oon. Therefore <HI>Shingas</HI> cannot go with you. He mu&s;t go with me, to help me in this great work; and I &s;hall &s;end nobody, but go my&s;elf, to make it known to all nations."</P>
<P>Then we thanked them for their care; and wi&s;hed him good &s;ucce&s;s on his journey and undertaking: and, as this me&s;&s;age had &s;uch a good effect on them, we hoped it would have the &s;ame on all other nations, when they came to hear it. I hoped that all the clouds would pa&s;s away, and the chearful light would &s;hine over all nations: &s;o I wi&s;hed them good a&s;&s;i&s;tance and help on their journey.

<P>I told them, "Brethren, you will remember that it was wrote to you by the general, that you might give credit to what we &s;ay; &s;o I am glad to hear of you, that you give credit; and we a&s;&s;ure you, that what we have told you is the truth; and you will find it &s;o."</P>
<P>They &s;aid further, "Brethren, we let you know, that the <HI>French</HI> have u&s;ed our people kindly, in every re&s;pect; they have u&s;ed them like gentlemen, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that live near them.

Now we de&s;ire you to be &s;trong; we wi&s;h you would take the &s;ame method, and u&s;e our people well: for the other <HI>Indians</HI> will look upon us;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>I.

<P>I told them, "I would take it to heart, and inform the Govern|or, and other gentlemen of it; and &s;peak to them in their favour." Then they &s;aid, "It is &s;o far well, and the road is cleared; but they thought we &s;hould &s;end them another call, when they may come." I told them; "We did not know when they would have agreed with the other nations. Brother, it is you, who mu&s;t give

up the fir&s;t notice when you can come; the &s;ooner the better; and &s;o &s;oon as you &s;end us word, we will prepare for you on the road." After this we made ready for our journey.</P>
<P><HI>Ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iu&s;hund,</HI> a noted <HI>Indian,</HI> one of the chief coun&s;ellors, told us in &s;ecret; "That all the nations had jointly agreed to defend their hunting place at <HI>Alleghenny,</HI> and &s;uffer nobody to &s;ettle there; and as the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> are very much inclined to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> intere&s;t, &s;o he begged us very much to tell the Governor, General, and all other people not to &s;ettle there. And if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would draw back over the mountain, they would get all the other nations into their intere&s;t; but if they &s;taid and &s;ettled there, all the nations would be again&s;t them; and he was afraid it would be a great war, and never come to a peace again."</P>
<P>I promi&s;ed to inform the Governor, General, and all other peo|ple of it, and repeated my former reque&s;t to them, not to &s;uffer any <HI>French</HI> to &s;ettle among&s;t them. After we had fetched our hor&s;es, we went from <HI>Ku&s;hku&s;hking,</HI> and came at five o'clock to <HI>Sac|cung,</HI> in company with twenty <HI>Indians.</HI> When we came about half way, we met a me&s;&s;enger from fort <HI>Duque&s;ne,</HI> with a belt from <HI>Thomas King,</HI> inviting all the chiefs to <HI>Saccung.</HI> We heard at the &s;ame time, that Mr. <HI>Croghn</HI> and <HI>Henry Montour</HI> would be there to day. The me&s;&s;enger was one of tho&s;e three, that went to our camp; and it &s;eemed to rejoice all the company; for &s;ome of them were much troubled in their minds, fearing that the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> had kept them, as pri&s;oners, or killed them. In the evening we arrived at <HI>Saccung,</HI> on the <HI>Beaver</HI> creek. We were well re|ceived. The king provided for us. After a little while we vi&s;ited Mr. <HI>Croghn</HI> and his company.</P>
<P>&mdash;30th. In the morning the <HI>Indians</HI> of the town vi&s;ited us. About eleven o'clock about forty came together; when we read the me&s;&s;age to them; Mr. <HI>Croghn, Henry Montour</HI> and <HI>Thomas King</HI> being pre&s;ent. They were all well plea&s;ed with the me&s;&s;age. In the evening we came together with the chiefs, and explained the &s;ignification of the belts; which la&s;ted till eleven o'clock at night.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 1&s;t. After hunting a great while for our hor&s;es, with|out finding them, we were obliged to give an <HI>Indian</HI> three hun|dred wampum for looking for them. We bought corn for four hundred and fifty wampum for our hor&s;es. The Indians met to|gether to hear what Mr. Croghn had to &s;ay. <HI>Thomas King</HI> &s;poke by a belt, and invited them to come to the general; upon which they all re&s;olved to go.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="034421_0498_0FFDA23C4EA05E98">In the evening the captains and coun&s;ellors came together, I and <HI>I&s;aac Still</HI> being pre&s;ent; they told us, that they had formerly agreed not to give any credit to any me&s;&s;age, &s;ent from the Engli&s;h by <HI>Indians;</HI> thinking, if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would have peace with them, they would come them&s;elves; "So &s;oon, therefore, as you came, it was as if the weather changed; and a great cloud pa&s;&s;ed away; and we could think again on our ancient friend&s;hip with our bre|thren, the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> We have thought &s;ince that time, more on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> than ever before, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">though the <HI>French</HI> have done all, in their power, to prejudice our young men again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Since you now come the &s;econd time, we think it is God's work; he pities us, that we &s;hould not all die; and if we &s;hould not ac|cept of the peace offered to us, we think God would for&s;ake us."</P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;e, they &s;poke about preaching, and &s;aid, "They wi&s;hed many times to hear the word of God; but they were al|ways afraid the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would take that opportunity to bring them into bondage." They invited me to come and live among&s;t them; &s;ince I had taken &s;o much pains in bringing a peace about between them and the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I told them, "It might be, that when the peace was firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, I would come to proclaim the peace and love of God to them."</P>
<P>In the evening arrived a me&s;&s;age, with a &s;tring of wampum, to a noted <HI>Indian, Ketiu&s;cund,</HI> to come to <HI>Wenango,</HI> to meet the <HI>Una|mi</HI> chief, <HI>Quitahicung</HI> there; he &s;aid that a <HI>French Mohock</HI> had kil|led a <HI>Delaware Indian;</HI> and when he was a&s;ked why he did it? He &s;aid the <HI>French</HI> bid him do it.</P>
<P>&mdash;2d. Early before we &s;et out, I gave 300 wampums to the <HI>Cayugas,</HI> to buy &s;ome corn for their hor&s;es; they agreed that I &s;hould go before to the general, to acquaint him of their coming, The <HI>Beaver</HI> creek being very high, it was almo&s;t two o'clock, in the afternoon, before we came over the creek; this land &s;eems to be very rich. I, with my companion, <HI>Kekiu&s;cund</HI>'s &s;on, came to Log's-town, &s;ituated on a hill. On the ea&s;t end is a great piece of low land, where the old <HI>Logs-town</HI> u&s;ed to &s;tand. In the new <HI>Logs-town</HI> the <HI>French</HI> have built about thirty hou&s;es for the <HI>Indians.</HI> They have a large corn field on the &s;outh &s;ide, where the corn &s;tands ungathered. Then we went farther through a large tract of fine land, along the river &s;ide. We came within eight miles of <HI>Pitt&s;burg,</HI> where we lodged on a hill, in the open air. It was a cold night; and I had forgot my blanket, being packed upon Mr. Hays's hor&s;e. Between <HI>Saccung</HI> and <HI>Pitt&s;burg,</HI> all the <HI>Shawanos</HI> towns are empty of people.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="034421_0499_0FFDA25350A54AA0">&mdash;3d. We &s;tarted early, and came to the river by <HI>Pitt&s;burg;</HI> we called that they &s;hould come over and fetch us; but their boats having gone adrift, they made a raft of black oak palli&s;adoes, which &s;unk as &s;oon as it came into the water. We were very hungry, and &s;taid on that i&s;land, where I had kept council with the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the month of Augu&s;t la&s;t; for all I had nothing to live on, I thought my&s;elf a great deal better off now, than at that time, having now liberty to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alk upon the i&s;land according to plea&s;ure; and it &s;eemed as if the dark clouds were di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>While I waited here, I &s;aw the general march off from <HI>Pitt&s;|burg;</HI> which made me &s;orry, that I could not have the plea&s;ure of &s;peaking with him. Towards evening our whole party arrived: upon which they fired from the fort with twelve great guns; and our <HI>Indians</HI> &s;aluted again three times round with their &s;mall arms. By accident &s;ome of the <HI>Indians</HI> found a raft hid in the bu&s;hes, and Mr. Hays, coming la&s;t, went over fir&s;t with two Indians. They &s;ent us but a &s;mall allowance; &s;o that it would not &s;erve each round. I tied my belt a little clo&s;er, being very hungry, and nothing to eat.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As it often happens to the <HI>Indians,</HI> on their long marches, in war, and &s;ome|times in their hunting expeditions, to be without victuals for &s;everal days, occa&s;ioned by bad weather and other accidents, they have this cu&s;tom in &s;uch ca&s;es; which <HI>Po&s;t</HI> probably learned of them, viz. girding their bellies tight, when they have nothing to put in them; and they &s;ay it pre&s;ents the pain of hunger.</NOTE> It &s;nowed, and we were obliged to &s;leep without any &s;helter. In the evening they threw light balls from the fort; at which the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;tarted, thinking they would fire at them; but &s;eeing it was not aimed at them, they rejoiced to &s;ee them fly &s;o high.</P>
<P>&mdash;4th. We got up early, and cleared a place from the &s;now, cut &s;ome fire wood, and hallooed till we were tired. Towards noon Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> came with a raft, and the <HI>Indian</HI> chiefs went over: he informed me of Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI>'s di&s;plea&s;ure with the <HI>Indians</HI> an&s;wer to the general, and his de&s;ire that they &s;hould al|ter their mind, in in&s;i&s;ting upon the general's going back; but the <HI>Indians</HI> had no inclination to alter their mind. In the afternoon &s;ome provi&s;ion was &s;ent over, but a &s;mall allowance. When I came over to the fort, the council with the <HI>Indians</HI> was almo&s;t at an end. I had a di&s;cour&s;e with Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI> about the affairs, di&s;po&s;ition and re&s;olution of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>I drew provi&s;ion for our journey to fort <HI>Ligonier,</HI> and baked bread for our whole company: towards noon the <HI>Indians</HI> met to|gether in a conference. Fir&s;t king <HI>Beaver</HI> addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the <HI>Mohocks,</HI> de&s;iring them to give their brethren an an&s;wer about

&s;ettling at <HI>Pitt&s;burg.</HI> The <HI>Mohocks</HI> &s;aid, "They lived at &s;uch a di&s;tance, that they could not defend the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there, if any ac|cident &s;hould befal them; but you, cou&s;ins, who live clo&s;e here, mu&s;t think what to do." Then <HI>Beaver</HI> &s;aid by a &s;tring:</P>
<P>"What this me&s;&s;enger has brought is very agreeable to us; and as our uncles have made peace with you, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and many other nations, &s;o we likewi&s;e join, and accept of the peace offered to us; and we have already an&s;wered by your me&s;&s;enger, what we have to &s;ay to the general, that he &s;hould go back over the mount|ains; we have nothing to &s;ay to the contrary."</P>
<P>Neither Mr. <HI>Croghn</HI> nor <HI>Andrew Montour</HI> would tell Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI> the <HI>Indians'</HI> an&s;wer. Then Mr. <HI>Croghn,</HI> Colonel <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI> and Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI> went into the tent by them&s;elves, and I went upon my bu&s;ine&s;s. What they have further agreed I do not know; but when they had done, I called king <HI>Beaver, Shingas,</HI> and <HI>Kekeu&s;cund,</HI> and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Brethren, if you have any alteration to make, in the an&s;wer to the general, concerning leaving this place, you will be plea&s;ed to let me know." They &s;aid, they would alter nothing, "We have told them three times to leave the place and go back; but they in&s;i&s;t upon &s;taying here; if, therefore, they will be de&s;troyed by the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Indians,</HI> we cannot help them."</P>
<P>Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI> &s;et out for <HI>Loyalhannon:</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> got &s;ome liquor between ten and eleven o'clock. One <HI>Mohock</HI> died; the others fired guns three times over him; at the la&s;t firing one had accidentally loaded his gun with a double charge: this gun bur&s;t to pieces, and broke his hand clean off; he al&s;o got a hard knock on his brea&s;t; and in the morning at nine o'clock he died, and they buried them in that place, both in one hole.</P>
<P>&mdash;6th. It was a cold morning; we &s;wam our hor&s;es over the river, the ice running violently. Mr. <HI>Croghn</HI> told me that the <HI>Indians</HI> had &s;poke, upon the &s;ame &s;tring that I had, to Colonel <HI>Bouquet,</HI> and altered their mind; and had agreed and de&s;ired that 200 men &s;hould &s;tay at the fort. I refu&s;ed to make any alteration in the an&s;wer to the general, till I my&s;elf did hear it of the <HI>Indi|ans;</HI> at which Mr. <HI>Croghn</HI> grew very angry. I told him I had already &s;poke with the <HI>Indians;</HI> he &s;aid, it was a d&mdash;d lie; and de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> to enquire of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and take down in writing what they &s;aid. Accordingly he called them, and a&s;ked them, if they had altered their &s;peech, or &s;poke to Colonel <HI>Bou|quet</HI> on that &s;tring they gave me. <HI>Shingas</HI> and the other coun&s;el|lor &s;aid, they had &s;poken nothing to Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI> on the &s;tring
<PB N="128" REF="034421_0501_0FFDA268F268B578">
they gave me, but what was agreed between the Indians at <HI>Ku&s;h|ku&s;hking.</HI> They &s;aid, Mr. <HI>Croghn</HI> and <HI>Henry Montour</HI> had not &s;poke and acted hone&s;tly and uprightly; they bid us not alter the lea&s;t, and &s;aid, "We have told them three times to go back; but they will not go, in&s;i&s;ting upon &s;taying here. Now you will let the governor, general, and all people know, that our de&s;ire is, that they &s;hould go back, till the other nations have joined in the peace, and then they may come and build a trading hou&s;e."</P>
<P>They then repeated what they had &s;aid the 5th in&s;tant. Then we took leave of them, and promi&s;ed to inform the general, go|vernor, and all other gentle people of their di&s;po&s;ition; and &s;o we &s;et out from <HI>Pitt&s;burg,</HI> and came within fifteen miles of the brea&s;t-work; where we encamped. It &s;nowed, and we made a little cabbin of hides.</P>
<P>&mdash;7th. Our hor&s;es were fainting, having little or no food. We came that day about twenty miles, to another brea&s;t-work; where the whole army had encamped on a hill; the water being far to fetch.</P>
<P>&mdash;8th. Between <HI>Pitt&s;burg</HI> and fort <HI>Ligonier</HI> the country is hilly, with rich bottoms, well timbered, but &s;cantily watered. We arrived at fort <HI>Ligonier</HI> in the afternoon, about four o'clock; where we found the general very &s;ick; and therefore could have no opportunity to &s;peak with him.</P>
<P>&mdash;9th. We waited to &s;ee the general; they told us he would march the next day, and we &s;hould go with him. Captain <HI>Sinclair</HI> wrote us a return for provi&s;ions for four days.</P>
<P>&mdash;10th. The general was &s;till &s;ick; &s;o that he could not go on the journey.</P>
<P>&mdash;11th. We longed very much to go farther; and therefore &s;poke to Major <HI>Halket,</HI> and de&s;ired him to enquire of the general, if he intended to &s;peak with us, or, if we might go; as we were in a poor condition, for want of linen, and other nece&s;&s;aries. He de&s;ired us to bring the <HI>Indians'</HI> an&s;wer, and our journal to the ge|neral. Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> read his journal to Major <HI>Halket</HI> and Governor <HI>Glen.</HI> They took memorandums, and went to the general.</P>
<P>&mdash;12th. They told us we &s;hould &s;tay till the general went.</P>
<P>&mdash;14th. The general intended to go; but his hor&s;es could not be found. They thought the <HI>Indians</HI> had carried them off. They hunted all day for the hor&s;es, but could not find them. I &s;poke to Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI> about our allowance being &s;o &s;mall, that we could hardly &s;ub&s;i&s;t; and that we were without money; and
<PB N="129" REF="034421_0502_0FFDA25187C935B8">
de&s;ired him to let us have &s;ome money, that we might buy nece&s;|&s;aries. Provi&s;ions, and every thing is exceeding dear. One pound of bread co&s;t a &s;hilling; one pound of &s;ugar four &s;hillings, a quart of rum &s;even &s;hillings and &s;ix pence, and &s;o in propor|tion. Colonel <HI>Bouquet</HI> laid our matters before the general; who let me call, and excu&s;ed him&s;elf, that his di&s;temper had hindered him from &s;peaking with me; and promi&s;ed to help me in every thing I &s;hould want, and ordered him to give me &s;ome money. He &s;aid farther, that I often &s;hould call; and when he was alone he would &s;peak with me.</P>
<P>&mdash;16th. Mr. <HI>Hays,</HI> being a hunting, was &s;o lucky as to find the general's hor&s;es, and brought them home; for which the gene|ral was very thankful to him.</P>
<P>&mdash;17th. Mr. <HI>Hays,</HI> being de&s;ired by Major <HI>Halket</HI> to go and look for the other hor&s;es, went, but found none.</P>
<P>&mdash;18th. The general told me to hold my&s;elf ready, to go with him down the country.</P>
<P>&mdash;20th. After we had been out two days, to hunt for our hor&s;es, in the rain, we went again to day, and were informed, they had been &s;een in a lo&s;t condition; one laying on the hill, and the other &s;tanding; they had been hoppled together; but a per&s;on told us, he had cut the hopples. When we came home we found the hor&s;es; they having made home to the fort.</P>
<P>&mdash;22d. It was cold and &s;tormy weather.</P>
<P>&mdash;23d. I hunted for our hor&s;es, and having found them, we gave them both to the king's commi&s;&s;ary; they not being able to carry us farther.</P>
<P>The &s;erjeant <HI>Henry O&s;ten,</HI> being one of the company that guid|ed us, as above mentioned, and was that &s;ame pri&s;oner, whom the <HI>Shavanos</HI> intended to burn alive, came to day to the fort. He was much rejoiced to &s;ee us, and &s;aid, "I thank you a thou&s;and times for my deliverance from the fire; and think it not too much to be at your &s;ervice my whole life time." He gave us intelligence that the <HI>Indians</HI> were, as yet, mightily for the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> His ma&s;|ter had offered to &s;et him at liberty, and bring him to <HI>Pitt&s;burg</HI> if he would promi&s;e him ten gallons of rum; which he did; and he was brought &s;afe to <HI>Pitt&s;burg. Delaware George</HI> is &s;till faithful to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and was very helpful to procure his liberty. <HI>I&s;aac Still, Shingas</HI> and <HI>Beaver</HI> are gone with the me&s;&s;age to the nations living further off. When the <HI>French</HI> had heard that the garri&s;on, at <HI>Pitt&s;burg,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted only of 200 men, they re&s;olved to go down
<PB N="130" REF="034421_0503_0FFDA23DD7021F18">
from <HI>Venango,</HI> and de&s;troy the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fort. So &s;oon as the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Ku&s;hku&s;hking,</HI> heard of their intention, they &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the <HI>French,</HI> de&s;iring them to draw back; for they would have no war in their country. The friendly <HI>Indians</HI> have &s;ent out parties with that intention, that if the <HI>French</HI> went on, in their march towards the fort, they would catch them, and bring them to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> They &s;hewed to <HI>O&s;ten</HI> the place, where eight <HI>French In|dian</HI> &s;pies had lain near the fort. By their marks upon the place they learned that the&s;e eight were gone back, and five more were to come to the &s;ame place again. He told us further, that the <HI>Indians</HI> had &s;poke among them&s;elves, that if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would join them, they would go to <HI>Venango,</HI> and de&s;troy the <HI>French</HI> there. We hear that the friendly <HI>Indians</HI> intend to hunt round the fort, at <HI>Pitt&s;burg,</HI> and bring the garri&s;on fre&s;h meat. And upon this intelligence the general &s;ent Captain <HI>Wedderholz</HI> with fifty men, to reinforce the garri&s;on at <HI>Pitt&s;burg.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;25th. The people in the camp prepared for a <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> frolick; but I kept <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> in the woods by my&s;elf.</P>
<P>&mdash;26th. To day an expre&s;s came from <HI>Pitt&s;burg</HI> to inform the general, that the French had called all the <HI>Indians</HI> in their intere&s;t together, and intended to come and de&s;troy them there.</P>
<P>&mdash;27th. Towards noon the general &s;et out; which cau&s;ed a great joy among the garri&s;on, which had hitherto lain in tents, but now being a &s;maller company, could be more comfortably lodged. It &s;nowed the whole day. We encamped by a <HI>beaver dam,</HI> under <HI>Laurel Hill.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;28th. We came to <HI>Stony Creek,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Quich&s;ell</HI> is &s;tationed. The general &s;ent Mr. <HI>Hays,</HI> expre&s;s, to fort <HI>Bedford (Rays Town)</HI> and commanded him to &s;ee, if the place for en|campment, under the <HI>Allegheny</HI> mountain, was prepared; as al&s;o to take care that refre&s;hments &s;hould be at hand, at his coming. It was &s;tormy and &s;nowed all the day.</P>
<P>&mdash;29th. On the road I came up with &s;ome waggons; and found my hor&s;es with the company; who had taken my hor&s;e up, and intended to carry the &s;ame away. We encamped on this &s;ide, under the <HI>Allegheny</HI> hill.</P>
<P>&mdash;30th. Very early I hunted for my hor&s;es, but in vain, and therefore was obliged to carry my &s;addle bags, and other baggage on my back. The burden was heavy, the roads bad; which made me very tired, and came late to <HI>Bedford;</HI> where I took my old lodging with Mr. <HI>Frazier.</HI> They received me kindly, and re|fre&s;hed me according to their ability.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="034421_0504_0FFDA24708E8C6E8">&mdash;31&s;t. This day we re&s;ted, and, contrary to expectation, preparation was made for moving further to-morrow. Mr. <HI>Hays,</HI> who has his lodging with the commander of that place, vi&s;ited me:</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 1&s;t. 1759. We &s;et out early. I got my &s;addle bags upon a waggon; but my bed and covering I carried upon my back; and came that day to the cro&s;&s;ing of <HI>Juniata;</HI> where I had poor lodgings, being obliged to &s;leep in the open air, the night being very cold.</P>
<P>&mdash;2d. We &s;et out early. I wondered very much that the hor&s;es, in the&s;e &s;lippery roads, came &s;o well with the waggons over the&s;e &s;teep hills. We came to fort <HI>Littleton;</HI> where I drew provi&s;ions; but could not find any who had bread, to exchange for flour. I took lodging in a common hou&s;e. Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> arrived late.</P>
<P>&mdash;3d. We ro&s;e early. I thought to travel the neare&s;t road to <HI>Shippen</HI>'s <HI>Town,</HI> and therefore de&s;ired leave of the general to pro|&s;ecute my journey to <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and wait for his excellency there; but he de&s;ired me to follow in his company. It &s;nowed, freezed, rained, and was &s;tormy the whole day. All were exceeding glad that the general arrived &s;afe at fort <HI>Loudon.</HI> There was no room in the fort for &s;uch a great company; I, therefore, and &s;ome others went two miles further, and got lodgings at a plantation.</P>
<P>&mdash;4th. I and my company took the upper road; which is three miles nearer to <HI>Shippen</HI>'s <HI>town,</HI> where we arrived this even|ing. The &s;lippery roads made me, as a traveller, very tired.</P>
<P>&mdash;5th. To day I &s;taid here for the general. Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> went ten miles further, to &s;ee &s;ome of his relations. In the afternoon <HI>I&s;rael Pemberton</HI> came from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to wait upon the general.</P>
<P>&mdash;6th. I came to-day ten miles to Mr. <HI>Miller</HI>'s, where I lodged, having no comfortable place in <HI>Shippen</HI>'s <HI>town;</HI> all the hou&s;es being crowded with people.</P>
<P>&mdash;7th. They made preparation, at Mr. <HI>Millers,</HI> for the re|ception of the general; but he, being &s;o well to-day, re&s;olved to go as far as <HI>Carli&s;le.</HI> I could &s;carce find any lodging there. <HI>Henry Montour</HI> was &s;o kind as to take me in his room.</P>
<P>&mdash;8th. I begged the general for leave to go to <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> hav|ing &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, which he at la&s;t granted. I went to captain Sinclair for a hor&s;e, who ordered me to go to the chief ju&s;tice of the town; who ought to procure one for me, in the province &s;er|vice. According to this order I went; but the ju&s;tice told me, that he did not know how to get any hor&s;e; if I would go and look for one, he &s;hould be glad if I found any. But having no

<P>&mdash;9th. To-day I cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Su&s;quahanna</HI> over the ice, and came within thirteen miles of <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI> It was &s;lippery and heavy travelling.</P>
<P>&mdash;10th. It rained all the day. I arrived at three o'clock, in the afternoon, in <HI>Lanca&s;ter;</HI> and was quite refre&s;hed, to have the favour to &s;ee my brethren.</P>
