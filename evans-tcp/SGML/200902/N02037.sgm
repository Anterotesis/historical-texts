<Q><BIBL>ISAIAH I. 10.</BIBL>
<P><HI>Come now, and let us rea&s;on together, &s;aith the LORD:</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_WE have here the Great and dreadful GOD, be&s;peaking his &s;inful and wretched people, in the mo&s;t gracious and merciful manner that can be imagined. He is earne&s;tly calling them to Repentance and Reformation; <HI>Wa&s;h ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings,</HI> &amp;c. He is a&s;&s;uring them of the ready and full pardon of all their Sins upon their Repentance, how heinous and ag|gravated &s;oever they were: <HI>Tho' your &s;ins be as Scarlet,</HI> &amp;c. He propo&s;es therefore to <HI>rea&s;on</HI> the Ca&s;e with them, that he might effectually convince, affect and per&s;wade them; <HI>Come now and let us rea&s;on together, &s;aith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>LET them hear GOD what he has to &s;ay to 'em, and GOD is ready to hear them in their
<PB N="2" REF="002421_0004_0FDC04D95FE60FB8">turn, if they can have any thing to an&s;wer, any rea&s;on to give, why they &s;hould not repent.</P>
<P>WAS ever any any thing &s;o <HI>Good,</HI> conde&s;cend|ing and compa&s;&s;ionate? So righteous, equitable and rea&s;onable? as a <HI>Father</HI> to his erring <HI>Son,</HI> rather than as a <HI>Judge</HI> unto his provoking, arraigned, judged people! <HI>Come now and let us rea&s;on together, &s;aith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>JUST before he had been decking him&s;elf with Maje&s;ty, and arraying him&s;elf with glory, and &s;peaking with the utmo&s;t &s;everity and terror: <HI>ver.</HI> 2. <HI>Hear O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the Lord hath &s;poken</HI> ver. 10. <HI>Hear ye the word of the Lord ye people of Sodom and Gomorrah!</HI> But how &s;weetly does the &s;tyle here change into the mild and &s;ofter words of Grace, mercy and com|pa&s;&s;ion! <HI>Come now and let us rea&s;on together &s;aith the Lord,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>IT may be the people of <HI>Judah</HI> might be ready to <HI>object</HI> again&s;t the vehemence and &s;everity of GOD by his <HI>Prophet,</HI> as too much and hard and unrea&s;onable. That they were a &s;inful People they might be ready to own, but not to that degree nor &s;o univer&s;ally as they are here charged and arraign|ed, they might be ready to hope. And tho' there might be much ami&s;s in the Wor&s;hip they render'd to GOD, yet they might look upon the &s;light pour'd thereupon, <HI>ver.</HI> 11, 12, 13, to be in a very unrea&s;onable Exce&s;s. Wherefore to <HI>obviate</HI> and an&s;wer &s;uch a ri&s;ing and rea&s;oning in their hearts, GOD &s;peaks in the <HI>Text;</HI> "Come now, and let us rea&s;on together, let us debate the matter fairly, let me convince you of my own Ju&s;tice and Equity, righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s, if words will convince
<PB N="3" REF="002421_0005_0FDC04DC1AD95250">you. "Thus religion has rea&s;on on its &s;ide, and the GOD of heaven conde&s;cends to rea&s;on the Ca&s;e with them that contradict him, and find fault with his proceedings.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e and after this manner we often find the gracious GOD &s;tooping to <HI>rea&s;on the Ca&s;e</HI> with his poor people, again&s;t them&s;elves. I&s;a. 5.3. <HI>And now O Inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem, and men of Judah, judge I pray you betwixt me and my Vineyard.</HI> And in the 43. <HI>Chap.</HI> 26. <HI>ver. Put me in remem|brance,</HI> &s;ays GOD; <HI>Let us plead together, declare thou, that thou may&s;t be ju&s;tified.</HI> What fair play is here for their lives! did ever a Judge be&s;peak thus a Pri&s;oner at the Bar! or could a fellow Mor|tal, a fellow worm, &s;ay more to a Criminal that &s;tood for his life? The 18th <HI>Chapter</HI> of the pro|phe&s;ies of <HI>Ezekiel</HI> is all in this &s;train; particularly, <HI>v.</HI> 25. <HI>Hear now, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael, is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?</HI> And to name no more, the <HI>Holy One</HI> leaves it to the Con&s;cience of his people to accu&s;e him if they cou'd &amp; acquit them&s;elves: Micah 6.2, 3. <HI>For the Lord hath a con|trover&s;ie with his people, and he will plead with I&s;rael; O my people, what have I done unto thee? te&s;tify again&s;t me.</HI> The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, &s;ome of 'em, do even exceed the Words of my <HI>text</HI> in graciou&s;ne&s;s. They are a high and glorious <HI>Comment</HI> on them. They &s;hine like the <HI>Sun</HI> in their own brightne&s;s, and no words of man can add to them.</P>
<P>To come now to my <HI>Text,</HI> and rai&s;e &s;ome <HI>Doctrinal Ob&s;ervations</HI> from it.</P>

II. IF Sinners would but hearken to rea&s;on they would repent. <HI>Wa&s;h you, make you clean &punc; put away</HI> &amp;c; <HI>come now, and let us rea&s;on together.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. GOD rea&s;ons therefore and argues with men for this very end to bring 'em to repentance. <HI>Come now, and let us rea&s;on together, &s;aith the Lord, tho' your &s;ins be as &s;carlet, they &s;hall be as wool,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>GOD deals with us as rational Crea|tures, and treats with us in a rea&s;onable manner.</HI> Such he <HI>made</HI> us, and accordingly he <HI>treats</HI> us.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>HE made us rational Creatures.</HI> GOD made Man a <HI>living Soul;</HI> he made him in his own <HI>Image;</HI> he made him <HI>but a little lower than the Angels,</HI> an Intelligent &amp; immortal <HI>Spirit</HI> as they are. Gen. 1.26. <HI>And God &s;aid, let us make man in our I|mage, after our likene&s;s, and let him have dominion.</HI> It is the <HI>Soul</HI> of man that does e&s;pecially bear the Image of GOD. In <HI>this</HI> it is that he re&s;embles the Great <HI>Father of Spirits;</HI> even as the Offspring re|&s;embles the Parent. Act. 17.28. <HI>For we are his off|&s;pring.</HI> "The faculties of our Souls are to us as the cleare&s;t looking-gla&s;s wherein to &s;ee GOD. By the&s;e it is that we become capable of conceiving of GOD's Spiritual Nature &amp; Perfections, Provi|dence, Government &amp; Judgment. We are <HI>Minds.</HI> As the Angels of Heaven are <HI>Intelligences;</HI> &s;o Man is a <HI>Spiritual Intelligence,</HI> Job 32.8. <HI>There is a &s;pirit in man, aud the In&s;piration of the Almighty giveth him under&s;tanding.</HI> There is a Soul in man endued with a principle and power of rea&s;oning; and this Mind needs to be enlightned by the Spirit of GOD. In our <HI>natural &s;tate</HI> we are taught more than the bea&s;t of the earth, and are made Wi&s;er than the fowl of heaven; but in <HI>Regeneration</HI> the Under|&s;tanding
<PB N="5" REF="002421_0007_0FDC04E4F23BDD00">of man is divinely Illuminated from above to di&s;cern the things of GOD. The Spirit of Man is the Candle of the LORD; <HI>Prov.</HI> 20.27. Of his lighting within him and &s;etting up there, to give light to the hou&s;e. Such a light within is <HI>Con&s;cience;</HI> a mo&s;t noble faculty, GOD's Deputy. The Fa|ther of Spirits is the Father of this Light. <HI>He lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</HI> Joh. 1.9. We feel this power of thinking, rea&s;oning and arguing in our &s;elves. <HI>My thoughts cau&s;e me to an&s;wer,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Zophar: I am full of matter,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Elibu,</HI> and <HI>the Spirit within me, con&s;traineth me.</HI> We are made rational Creatures, Intelligent Beings.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Accordingly GOD deals with us; treats us and carries toward us.</HI> This is right and ju&s;t; and ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the <HI>mo&s;t perfect Being.</HI> He governs and orders all his Creatures according to the nature he gives them. The Creatures that have not rea&s;on for their own Conduct, he rules them by <HI>In&s;tinct.</HI> Tho&s;e that have rea&s;on are capable of moral Go|vernment, and accordingly he governs them by <HI>daws</HI> given to them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>OUR holy and glorious Maker has written his Law in us; and it was written very fairly in man at fir&s;t.</HI> Yea there yet remains very legible upon the heart of man much of the will and law of GOD to him, and he that will but look within him&s;elf, and attend to the voice of his own Rea&s;on and Con|&s;cience, can't but read it there. Hence we read of the very <HI>heathen</HI> that they <HI>retained the Truth in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Rom. 1.18. They did not go|vern them&s;elves by the dictates of their own rea&s;on and Con&s;cience, but rebelled again&s;t the &s;ame.
<PB N="6" REF="002421_0008_0FDC04E806D17BC0"><HI>That which might be known of God was manife&s;t in them; for God had &s;hewed it unto them.</HI> That is, his own E&s;&s;ential Attributes and Perfections, from whence they might and &s;hould have argu'd their relation to him, his Expectation from them and Will concerning them; their Duty and Obligations towards him. They were <HI>left without excu&s;e</HI> in their acting contrary to this light of nature and trampling under foot their own Rea&s;on; <HI>becoming vain in their Imaginations and darkning their own fooli&s;h hearts.</HI> Indeed this is <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to a rational Creature to have the <HI>Law of GOD</HI> written on his Mind and Con&s;cience; for Rea&s;on in us is this Law; and it is given man for his Government and Conduct.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>SINCE our fall GOD has written his Law, mind and will to us in his Word.</HI> This be|came nece&s;&s;ary for the <HI>recovery</HI> of man from the Ruin his Apo&s;tacy had bro't upon him. The light of rea&s;on was wofully <HI>ob&s;cured,</HI> and the law writ|ten upon his heart dreadfully <HI>obliterated,</HI> by the corruption of the Soul, and the A&s;cendency that lu&s;t had gain'd; &s;o that a <HI>Revelation</HI> from GOD became nece&s;&s;ary, and that he &s;hould <HI>write the great things of his law in tables of &s;tone,</HI> which he had before written in the <HI>table of the heart.</HI> And accordingly GOD has done &s;o; and we have <HI>his Book</HI> in our hands, to read it with our eyes, and know his Mind and Will for our Salvation; that we may do it and be ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P N="1">1. GOD has given his Word <HI>to inform our Under&s;tandings in what is right and good.</HI> He hath &s;hewed thee; O man, what is good and what doth the LORD thy GOD require of thee. The
<PB N="7" REF="002421_0009_0FDC04EBC442E588">Commandment is a lamp, and the law is a light; and all that is written by the In&s;piration of GOD, is written for our learning, that we thro' patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope. The way of man is not now in him&s;elf, nor is he a &s;uffi|cient Law unto him&s;elf; therefore is the glorious Go&s;pel of JESUS CHRIST, according to the Com|mandment of the Everliving GOD, made known to all Nations for the Obedience of Faith. This only can make us wi&s;e unto Salvation: this Wi&s;dom from above; the word which is near unto us, in our hands, lips and hearts. Nor are we to be wi&s;e above what is written.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS written word of GOD is given <HI>to com|mand our wills, and Con&s;cience</HI> to embrace and obey the truth and duty, therein propo&s;ed to us. It addre&s;&s;es with a full and ab&s;olute authority to this <HI>Imperial faculty</HI> within us, being the law of the <HI>Su|preme Maje&s;ty of heaven</HI> to us. Deut. 4.1. <HI>Now therefore hearken, O I&s;rael unto the &s;tatutes &amp; judg|ments which I teach you to do them.</HI> And the more effectually to command our &s;ouls it addre&s;&s;es powerfully,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>TO our hopes &amp; fears, and unto every pa&s;&s;ion of our Souls</HI> by them to work on us. To our hopes by the mo&s;t con&s;training <HI>promi&s;es;</HI> and to our fears by the mo&s;t dreadful <HI>threatnings.</HI> It &s;ets before us <HI>a ble&s;&s;ing</HI> &amp; a <HI>cur&s;e,</HI> Deut. 11.26. <HI>A ble&s;&s;ing if we obey the Commandments of the Lord our God, and a cur&s;e if we do not.</HI> Our &s;ouls move upon the&s;e Motives if either rea&s;on or &s;en&s;e be hearkned to. And becau&s;e we are drawn by <HI>love</HI> and urg'd on to a thing by <HI>de&s;ire;</HI> therefore the &s;ure Word of GOD addre&s;&s;es to the&s;e Affections in
<PB N="8" REF="002421_0010_0FDC04EEC6FE0DE8">us, that we love the LORD our GOD with all our hearts and with all our Souls, and &s;eek him with our whole de&s;ires. In like manner, whatever other pa&s;&s;ion and affection is common to man, and which are the <HI>Avenues</HI> to his Soul, tho&s;e ways has the HOLY GHOST taken in his in&s;pired word by one or other of them to &s;urpri&s;e or force our Souls. It &s;ometimes therefore moves our <HI>anger</HI> and in|dignation, &s;ometimes our <HI>hatred,</HI> &s;ometimes our <HI>grief</HI> or <HI>&s;hame.</HI></P>
<P>THUS GOD deals with us <HI>as with rational Creatures,</HI> and according to the nature and facul|ties he has given us: Wherein as he <HI>puts honour</HI> on Man's rea&s;on, &s;o he &s;hews how <HI>great a Sin</HI> it is in man to violate his own Rea&s;on and offend again&s;t it. We ought to <HI>u&s;e</HI> the Rea&s;on GOD has given, yea and to <HI>reverence</HI> it: It is the rule and law of the Eternal and perfect <HI>Infinite Mind</HI> in&s;cribed <HI>on</HI> us and <HI>for</HI> us: we &s;hou'd reverence it as the <HI>Wi&s;dom of GOD,</HI> as indeed it is.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>IF Sinners would but hearken to rea|&s;on they would repent.</HI> If men would but govern them&s;elves by rea&s;on and act rationally, they would not continue in Sin. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>RIGHT rea&s;on is a Divine Law to Man:</HI> the law of GOD in us, the voice of GOD to us. It is the Eternal and immutable rule of truth, goodne&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s. There can be no tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of it, nor Deviation from it without Sin. It is the law and light of Nature; the Law that Angels act by, the Rule of all GOD's perfect Acts and Works. "There are certain Rules of moral "goodne&s;s, wherein all Under&s;tandings are agreed,
<PB N="9" REF="002421_0011_0FDC04F1C7217850">and in acting according to which ever Intelligent Being attains its true perfection. It is the Glory of <HI>GOD</HI> that he always acts according to the mo&s;t perfect Rea&s;on, and this is the Crown of <HI>Angels,</HI> and the unchangable Rule of <HI>Man's</HI> arriving at the honour and happine&s;s for which he was created.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IF rea&s;on had been hearkned to, Man had never fallen from GOD, or &s;inn'd again&s;t him.</HI> Had he attended to the voice of his own upright Con&s;cience he had pre&s;erv'd his Integrity. Had <HI>Eve</HI> &s;tood by her own wi&s;e and ju&s;t <HI>An&s;wer</HI> at fir&s;t to the Tempter, and accordingly dete&s;ted his mo|tion to her, &s;he had trod him under fool and broken his head with her heel. But &s;he li&s;tned to the Tempter's An&s;wer, and &s;uffered her mind to wan|der from the words &s;he fir&s;t &s;pake in the Wi&s;dom of GOD. Gen. 3.2, 3. <HI>And the Woman &s;aid unto the &s;erpent,&mdash;God hath &s;aid, ye &s;hall not eat of this tree, neither &s;hall ye touch it, le&s;t ye die.</HI> Indeed it may &s;eem that <HI>Eve</HI> did not act according to the Dictate of right rea&s;on in an&s;wering the Serpent at all; yet her <HI>An&s;wer</HI> was according to the Dictate of right rea&s;on, full of Gratitude, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Re&s;olution; and had &s;he &s;tood by it &s;he had baffled the tempter, and pre&s;erv'd her &s;elf and us. But pre&s;ently &s;he abandon'd her Rea&s;on, and pro&s;tituted her Con&s;cience, li&s;tning to the <HI>Devil</HI> and to the lye which he gave to GOD, and looking on the fruit with a lu&s;ting Eye. Had &s;he not <HI>left</HI> her rea&s;on, &s;he had not <HI>lo&s;t</HI> her &s;elf.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>MAN's recovery to GOD depends now upon his attention to the voice of rea&s;on and Con&s;ci|ence, upon the Di&s;coveries, propo&s;als and Call of the Go&s;pel to him.</HI> Let the Sinner con&s;ider <HI>the&s;e,</HI> and
<PB N="10" REF="002421_0012_0FDC04F55C585CE8">u&s;e his rea&s;on and hearken to his own Con&s;cience, and he will turn unto GOD. Let him <HI>think of his ways,</HI> his folly and &s;in, his Intere&s;t and duty; which the Convictions of the HOLY SPIRIT bring every one to do that repents; and he will <HI>turn his feet to God's te&s;timonies.</HI> So the <HI>Prodigal</HI> came to him&s;elf, and rea&s;oned rightly with him&s;elf, and <HI>aro&s;e and came to his Father,</HI> Luke 15.17. He had in all his riot acted madly and irrationally, an ab&s;urd and irrational part; but now he came to him&s;elf, to the u&s;e of his Under&s;tanding, to a &s;ober rea&s;oning with him&s;elf, he &s;traitway left his vicious Cour&s;es. This Exerci&s;e of rea&s;on and acting upon it is a thing very plea&s;ing to GOD; as it is to a wi&s;e and good Parent to &s;ee a fooli&s;h, pa&s;&s;ionate and ob&s;tinate Child bethink him&s;elf and humble him&s;elf. Job 33.27. <HI>He looketh upon men, and if any &s;ay I have &s;inned, and perverted that which is right and it pro&s;iteth me not; he will deliver his &s;oul from going down into the pit, and his life &s;hall &s;ee the light.</HI> In a word, The End of the writ|ten and preached Word is to reclaim men from &s;in, and to recover them from guilt and hell by bringing them to repentance; and this by in|forming and enlightning their minds and awaken|ing their Con&s;ciences. It may be &s;aid of the <HI>whole word,</HI> its u&s;e, de&s;ign and end, as it is of the <HI>Book of Proverbs</HI> in particular, Prov. 1. <HI>Init. That we may know wi&s;dom and in&s;truction, to perceive the words of under&s;tanding, to give knowledge and di&s;|cretion, and that we may attain unto wi&s;e Coun&s;els.</HI> Grace re&s;tores the Exerci&s;e of rea&s;on and brings Sinners to repent. The <HI>Prophet</HI> therefore thus ad|dre&s;&s;es them; I&s;a. 46.8. <HI>Remember this, and &s;hew
<PB N="11" REF="002421_0013_0FDC04F958022610">your &s;elves Men; bring it again to mind, O ye tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors.</HI> i. e. U&s;e your rea&s;on, review your actions, look 'em over and over, do it deliverately, calmly, &s;eriou&s;ly; con&s;ider the nature of your evil|doings, the i&s;&s;ue and Con&s;equent of them; and you will be no longer tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; you will repent of your pa&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, you will trangre&s;s no more.</P>
<P>But here it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>FALLEN-MAN could not by any natural light have di&s;covered whether GOD would admit or decept of his repentance;</HI> or what <HI>kind</HI> or <HI>degree</HI> of repentance he would require; or how any &s;ort and degree of it <HI>could procure favour with GOD,</HI> or prevail to obtain his mo&s;t gracious pardon. The rea&s;on of Man could carry him no further than a <HI>peradventure</HI> as to the&s;e things; and as his <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> would lead him to <HI>wi&s;h</HI> it po&s;&s;ible for GOD to for|give Sin; &s;o a <HI>general notion</HI> of the goodne&s;s of GOD might po&s;&s;ibly lead him to <HI>think</HI> it probable, or to pre&s;ume on it as certain that there is forgivene&s;s with GOD, upon a Sinner's repentance. But at la&s;t the bare Rea&s;on of Mankind could never afford us any certain Information about GOD's for|giving Sin; and our guilt would forbid us to build any hope upon a rotten Conjecture.</P>

Eph. 4.18. <HI>Having the under&s;tanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God thro' the Ignorance that is in us, by rea- of the blindne&s;s of the heart.</HI> Thus the light that is in us becomes in a manner darkne&s;s, and the poor light that is, is re&s;i&s;ted, &s;inn'd again&s;t, and quench'd by the violent lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of Men. Be&s;ides, 2. There is a wretched <HI>Impotency</HI> in man to act up to the light of Rea&s;on within him. It can't and won't attend to its voice in every ca&s;e; nor can it ea&s;ily know the true judgment and determination of rea&s;on in every ca&s;e; but thro' the Corruption that is in the world thro' lu&s;t, many things occur to bia&s;s and mi&s;lead men from judging according to right rea&s;on; Often Education does &s;o; and being mi&s;s-taught in our early days, we ea&s;ily imbibe errors, fal&s;e rea&s;onings and prejudices again&s;t the truth; and often where we are well In&s;tructed at fir&s;t, yet our lu&s;ts corrupt, bribe and pervert our Judgment; and <HI>the law in the members wars again&s;t the law in the mind and leads into Captivity to the law of &s;in in the members.</HI> It is not therefore in the power of meer Rea&s;on to prevail upon a &s;inner to repent.

<P N="3">3. <HI>GOD by his powerful Spirit and Grace, when he renews a Soul unto repentance, brings it to at|tend and hearken unto the voice of rea&s;on and Con|&s;cience.</HI> He renews the <HI>Mind</HI> of man and en|lightens it; gives it a new and true &s;ight of things; a di&s;covery of truth by a divine Illumination, brings it to rea&s;on ju&s;tly, and he that was <HI>once darkne&s;s

<P N="4">4. <HI>GOD makes that di&s;covery of him&s;elf, of &s;in, of his will and grace for our Salvation, that the Soul cannot re&s;i&s;t but mo&s;t freely falls into the ex|erci&s;e of a gracious repentance.</HI> 1.

<P>THUS GOD in renewing a Sinner to repentance brings him to attend and hearken to the voice of Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience enlightned by the revealed word.

The &s;cope of the <HI>Holy Scripture</HI> is to command, per&s;wade, invite us to be &s;aved; and to deter, affright and earne&s;tly dehort us from the ways of &s;in and death.
