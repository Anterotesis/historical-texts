<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE en&s;uing addre&s;s to a mini&s;ter and his church in Berwick, was not wrote with any de&s;ign of publication; and when that was fir&s;t reque&s;ted, I intirely de|clined it for &s;everal rea&s;ons; one of which was, that I would be far from expo&s;ing private concerns to public view, farther than is nece&s;&s;ary. But upon a renewed reque&s;t from my friends in Ber|wick, and viewing how greatly tho&s;e called the Bapti&s;t principles are mi&s;taken and mi&s;repre&s;ented by mini&s;ters and churches in that part of the coun|try, where they are but little known, I thought proper to yield to the reque&s;t: Neither in reality are the&s;e private concerns, for they were publicly acted among them, and there is rea&s;on to think that both authors and neighbouring mini&s;ters were con|&s;ulted in the affair. Though what had the greate&s;t weight in my mind was, the con&s;ideration that many who are filling the nation with the cry of LIBERTY, and again&s;t <HI>oppre&s;&s;ors,</HI> are at the &s;ame time them|&s;elves violating that deare&s;t of all rights, LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE; for if that man is <HI>inexcu&s;able</HI> who judgeth another, and yet doth the <HI>&s;ame things,</HI> and if we are <Q>&s;ure that the judgment of God is according to truth, again&s;t them which commit &s;uch things,</Q> is it not a needful kindne&s;s, in&s;tead of an injury, to endeavour to &s;hew to &s;uch, be
<PB N="4" REF="011556_0003_0F87215858D77F40">
they ever &s;o much our &s;uperiors, wherein they are expo&s;ing them&s;elves to that judgment? And as I am &s;en&s;ible that multitudes have the &s;ame notions concerning liberty of con&s;cience, as this mini&s;ter and church have, I &s;hall tran&s;cribe their &s;entiments upon it, and make a few remarks thereon.</P>
<P>They expre&s;s them&s;elves thus: <Q>As to what you &s;ay of <HI>tying the con&s;cience in &s;piritual things,</HI> we can hardly think what you refer to. It is what we intirely di&s;allow and prote&s;t again&s;t, and are not &s;en&s;ible of doing it; but it you can con|vince us of having done it, we are ready to re|move that objection.&mdash;Liberty of con&s;cience we claim our&s;elves and allow others, as a darling point; and therefore mu&s;t not be <HI>forced</HI> to any thing contrary to <HI>our</HI> con&s;ciences, nor be thought to tye the con&s;ciences of others by <HI>not con&s;enting</HI> to what we cannot think to be for the honor of God, and intere&s;t of religion.</Q> It is readily granted, that the u&s;e either of force or fraud is con|trary to true liberty; but does it not look odd for a mini&s;ter and his church to talk of being <HI>forced,</HI> only by a reque&s;t from one of their members, de|livered in as mild and re&s;pectful terms as language can furni&s;h? However, by this we may gue&s;s what complaints we &s;hould hear, if they had as much occa&s;ion from us as we have from them. The plain fact is this. A brother of that church with|drew from their communion, and (as an atte&s;ted copy of their records &s;hews) gave two rea&s;ons for his &s;o doing: One was, their admitting per&s;ons of <HI>various characters</HI> to own the covenant, and bring their children to bapti&s;m: The other was, <Q>That he &s;aw a &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition again&s;t the &s;pirit of God in the church.</Q> And they don't deny the
<PB N="5" REF="011556_0004_0F8721592DBACD68">
truth of his rea&s;ons, but judged them not to be "&s;ufficient," and therefore declare him to "lie under the public offence of this church," &amp;c. And they afterward tell his wife that this cen&s;ure "was not for one opinion more than another, but for the neglect of&mdash;attending upon the Lord's &s;up|per." And when he and his wife were both con|vinced by a farther &s;earching of the &s;criptures, not only that the half-way covenant was wrong, but al&s;o that believers only were the proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, &s;he wrote a letter, wherein &s;he in a very re&s;pectful manner reque&s;ted a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion to the Bapti&s;t church in that town: In an&s;wer to which they wrote a letter to her as long as a &s;ermon, in which they po&s;itively <HI>deny</HI> her reque&s;t.</P>
<P>And what now is their liberty of con&s;cience come to? Why truly their <HI>members</HI> are <HI>forced</HI> either to believe as the church believes, or be dealt with as public offenders! They tell this &s;i&s;ter, that <Q>no|thing but very weighty and grievous things lying upon the con&s;cience, which they cannot remedy, can ju&s;tify a per&s;on to &s;eperate,</Q> &amp;c. Which implies, that in &s;uch a ca&s;e they may &s;eperate; yet who&s;e con&s;cience is to judge when the ca&s;e is &s;o? If it is only the church that is to judge, then where is their allowance of liberty to others as a darling point! It will doubtle&s;s be &s;aid, that they give rea|&s;ons for their denial of that reque&s;t. Well what are they? One of them is, they &s;ay that Bapti&s;t church was "&s;et up in an irregular manner." And was there ever a church which allowed that tho&s;e who &s;eperated from their irregularities, were regu|lar in &s;o doing? But to let others judge of this ca&s;e, I under&s;tand it to be plainly thus. Sundry of the&s;e brethren in Berwick, withdrew from this
<PB N="6" REF="011556_0005_0F87215A90D38A78">
and other churches for like rea&s;ons, and were dealt with in like manner as the&s;e mentioned above; and they were baptized by the pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;t church in Haverhill, and he with two deacons from that church were pre&s;ent when this church was con|&s;tituted on June 28. 1708. who have maintained divine wor&s;hip among them&s;elves ever &s;ince, and are owned as a regular church of Chri&s;t by &s;i&s;ter churches of the &s;ame faith and order. Regular, is a word which is turned to any purpo&s;e which men plea&s;e, and it is well known that it is often applied to tho&s;e who were lately guilty of the mo&s;t bloody di&s;orders and irregularities ever &s;een in our Metro|polis. And it expre&s;ly appears by what is before refer'd to, that all that this mini&s;ter and church in Berwick have again&s;t the&s;e two members, ari&s;es from their refu&s;ing to join with them; and by what I can learn, the ca&s;e is much the &s;ame with the re&s;t of the Bapti&s;t church, whom they call irregular.</P>
<P>I know there are &s;nares on every hand, which we &s;hould watch again&s;t, therefore let none mi&s;take me, and think that I am again&s;t mini&s;ters and chur|ches labouring faithfully with their members, if they think them out of the way in any re&s;pect; but the manner of their doing of it in the ca&s;e be|fore us, appears contrary to the go&s;pel rule of <HI>&s;peaking the truth in love,</HI> in the following par|ticulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. They try to &s;train a few of this &s;i&s;ter's ex|pre&s;&s;ions, to make her &s;ay what &s;he did not &s;ay, in order to get an advantage again&s;t her. Indeed they &s;ay they regard not &s;o much her incon&s;i&s;tency in writing, as in her &s;entiments and practice; but her &s;entiments and practice are plainly the&s;e, that there are &s;ome in that church which &s;he e&s;teems as
<PB N="7" REF="011556_0006_0F87215A9975CAB0">
<HI>beloved in Chri&s;t,</HI> and wi&s;hes well to them all, while the church as a body appears to her &s;o corrupt both in doctrine and practice, that &s;he cannot with a clear con&s;cience join with them: And where is any incon&s;i&s;tency in that?</P>
<P N="2">2. When they &s;et out to &s;hew the Bapti&s;ts errors, they bring in many truths which we hold as much as they do, and hereby unwary minds are catcht with a prejudice again&s;t us as a very bad people, that don't hold &s;uch good truths. So have I &s;een a net baited with as good wheat as that which is laid up in the garner. Some of the truths I refer to are the&s;e; that whatever agrees not with the law and te&s;timony, is to be rejected; that fathers, or our neare&s;t relations, are not to be followed, but rather te&s;tified again&s;t when they for&s;ake the truth and their duty; that bapti&s;m is a &s;ign of initiation or introduction into the vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t, and as &s;uch ought not to be repeated. The&s;e and other truths which they bring in, we hold as fully as they, and for them to repre&s;ent the contrary, is unfair dealing with us, and tends to deceive others.</P>
<P N="3">3. Having attempted to &s;trip us of &s;uch good cloathing, they would cloath us with &s;uch bear&s;kins as the&s;e, viz. That in order for a per&s;on to join with us, he mu&s;t renounce <Q>all that he has done to lay him&s;elf under obligations, all his profe&s;&s;ions, and all that God has done for him heretofore;</Q> and a great deal of &s;uch &s;tuff, which is as contrary to truth as darkne&s;s is to light. For they &s;ay, <Q>That mu&s;t be of men, which is not taken from the word of God, as enjoined there;</Q> therefore when we are convinced that infant-&s;prinkling is &s;uch, we renounce it, and practice believers bapti&s;m, which is plainly enjoined there, without the lea&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="011556_0007_0F87215B52D9E1C8">
thought of renouncing any thing which God has done for us, or that we have heretofore done to|wards him, that was agreeable to his will.</P>
<P N="4">4. Having thus laboured to turn her mind, they near the clo&s;e &s;ay, "If you <HI>will</HI> for&s;ake the church, you mu&s;t an&s;wer for it." In which, their putting a mark of di&s;tinction as they do upon the word <HI>will,</HI> plainly implies a judging her to be governed by will in&s;tead of con&s;cience, if &s;he does not yield to their arguments.</P>
<P>Now if, to &s;train an expre&s;&s;ion, and make a man an <HI>offender for a word;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 29.20, 21.</NOTE> if attempts to &s;trip &s;uch as appear again&s;t the evils of the times, of truths which they hold, and to load them with fal&s;e ac|cu&s;ations, and then to charge them, or &s;uch as join with them, with wilfulne&s;s in their way, were things peculiar to Berwick, I &s;hould not have expo&s;ed them thus to the world: But this is &s;o much the picture of modern liberty and charity, that a hold|ing of it up to view may po&s;&s;ibly be of &s;ervice to others. And though many may think this picture &s;ufficiently odious already, yet the fini&s;hing &s;troke is &s;till behind; which is for the &s;ecular arm to fini&s;h what the church has began. The church has de|clared the Bapti&s;t to be irregular, therefore the &s;e|cular power &s;till <HI>force</HI> them to &s;upport the wor&s;hip which they con&s;cientiou&s;ly di&s;&s;ent from; for this end the public teacher of the Bapti&s;t church in Ber|wick, and one of the &s;ociety, were &s;eized and carried pri&s;oners to York la&s;t winter, and they informed me that when they attempted to have the ca&s;e tried at April court, it was &s;hifted off by a pretence that the chief Judge might not &s;it becau&s;e he lived in Berwick, though the Bapti&s;ts de&s;ired he might &s;it:
<PB N="9" REF="011556_0008_0F87215FF6A0F470">
And as there was not enough to make a court with|out him, the other party could hereby prevent the ca&s;e from coming to the Superior Court until ano|ther year. This is done by men who pretend to allow liberty of con&s;cience to others as a darling point! And things of like nature are done in vari|ous parts of the land; of which at pre&s;ent take but two in&s;tances more. One is in the di&s;trict of Mon|tague, in the county of Hamp&s;hire, where is a Bapti&s;t church of many years &s;tanding; yet their neighbours force away, their e&s;tates from time to time, to &s;upport a wor&s;hip which they cannot join with: And I was informed by a credible Gentleman who was pre&s;ent, that when one of that church &s;ought for relief at la&s;t Augu&s;t court, the chief Judge (who was honor'd with that commi&s;&s;ion in con&s;equence of his being one of the 17 <HI>re&s;cinders</HI>) was in&s;trumental of turning the ca&s;e again&s;t him, by &s;uch a cant as this, viz. That the plaintiff was one of the &s;igners of their certifi|cate, and there was not the number which the law required without him. According to which, it is only for any people to di&s;train fir&s;t upon one of the committee, and then they may fall upon the re&s;t of the &s;ociety as they plea&s;e, as they have done at Montague &s;ince in a barbarous manner.</P>
<P>The other in&s;tance is at A&s;hfield, in the &s;ame county, where a Bapti&s;t church was con&s;tituted and a mini&s;ter regularly ordained in the year 1761, when they were the major part of the town; and they have maintained divine wor&s;hip among them&s;elves ever &s;ince; yet a number of a different per&s;ua&s;ion coming into the town afterward, and a few who were there before, with the help of non-re&s;ident proprietors, brought in a mini&s;ter of their own &s;en|timents, and have taxed the Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter and his
<PB N="10" REF="011556_0009_0F87216159AC53A0">
&s;ociety towards his &s;ettlement, &s;alary, and building their meeting-hou&s;e, for which they have forced a|way from them at &s;everal times to the value of <HI>ten Pounds</HI> lawful money on each right; and tho' the Bapti&s;t petitioned for relief to the General Court in May 1768, and obtained a vote that they &s;hould notify the town and proprietors of A&s;hfield, to &s;hew cau&s;e, if any they had, why their petition &s;hould not be granted, at the next Se&s;&s;ion of the court, and that the further collection of taxes from the petitioners &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended in the mean time; yet no &s;ooner were they gone home, but their opponents the next week <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chiefly, as I am informed, by means of the &s;ame Judge that turned the ca&s;e again&s;t them at Montague.</NOTE> obtained an Act to enable them to lay their mini&s;terial taxes upon all the lands in &s;aid town, let them be in who&s;e hands they would: In con&s;equence of which, they po&s;ted and &s;old la&s;t April at public vendue, for a very &s;mall part of their value, mowing land, winter grain, orch|arding, one dwelling-hou&s;e of a poor man's, and their burying place, in the whole about 400 acres; by which means, as they &s;ay in their petition to our General Court, <Q>We are not only deprived of li|berty of con&s;cience, which our mo&s;t gracious So|vereign has granted us in common with other his loyal &s;ubjects (which we have a right to in reli|gion and rea&s;on) but we are al&s;o in great mea&s;ure di&s;inherited, and in a fair way to be turned naked into the wide world; we humbly beg leave to &s;ay, The&s;e things are hard; very hard! for if we may not &s;ettle and &s;upport a mini&s;ter agreea|ble to our own con&s;ciences, where is liberty of con&s;cience? And if we may be allowed that li|berty, which is mo&s;t rea&s;onable, by what law, or with what equity, are we <HI>forced</HI> to pay for the
<PB N="11" REF="011556_0010_0F87216307245E80">
&s;ettlement of another with whom we cannot in con&s;cience join!</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e people (as they &s;ay in &s;aid petition, <Q>A con&s;iderable part of us &s;ettled on our lands in this town before the la&s;t war, and endured a great deal of hard&s;hip in the war, in building a fort upon our own co&s;t, and defending our&s;elves for &s;ome years, without any help from the province,)</Q> have been at a great deal of pains and expence in applications to our General Court from time to time, and this very year have been at the expence of no le&s;s than five journeys down above an hun|dred miles for that purpo&s;e, were at their Se&s;&s;ion in the &s;pring before, and in the time of their lands being torn from them, which they had cleared with the peril of their lives, becau&s;e of the &s;word of the wilderne&s;s; yet have got no relief, nor any en|couragement of it, but the contrary. And &s;ome, to ju&s;tify their conduct, plead that tho&s;e lands were granted upon condition of &s;ettling and &s;upporting that religion; and there are mini&s;ters who, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing <HI>peace, prepare war</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e who will not <HI>put into their mouth;</HI> and, as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q>That magi&s;trates &s;hould thus &s;uffer the&s;e incendiaries and di&s;turbers of the public peace, might ju&s;tly be wondered at; if it did not appear that they have been invited by them unto a par|ticipation of the &s;poil, and have therefore thought fit to make u&s;e of their covetou&s;ne&s;s and pride, as a means whereby to encrea&s;e their own power. For who does not &s;ee that <HI>the&s;e good men</HI> are in|deed more mini&s;ters of the government, than mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel.</Q></P>
<P>And that great rea&s;oner ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that <Q>The bu&s;ine&s;s of laws is not to provide for the
<PB N="12" REF="011556_0011_0F87216394EB9740">
truth of opinions, but for the &s;afety and &s;ecurity of the common-wealthy and of every particular man's goods and per&s;on. And &s;o it ought to be; for truth certainly would do well enough if &s;he were once left to &s;hift for her&s;elf. She &s;el|dom has received, and I fear never will receive, much a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the power of great men; to whom &s;he is but rarely known, and more rarely welcome. She is not taught by laws, nor has &s;he any need of force to procure her entrance into the minds of men. Errors indeed prevail by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of foreign and borrowed &s;uccours.</Q></P>
<P>Again, &s;ays he, <Q>To give laws, receive obedi|ence, and compel with the &s;word, belong to none but the civil magi&s;trate; and upon this ground I affirm, that the magi&s;trate's power extends not to the e&s;tabli&s;hing of any articles of faith, or forms of wor&s;hip, by force of laws. For laws are of no force at all without penalties." "The care of &s;ouls cannot belong to the civil magi&s;trate, be|cau&s;e his power con&s;i&s;ts only in outward force: But true and &s;aving religion con&s;i&s;ts in the inward per&s;ua&s;ion of the mind; without which nothing can be acceptable to God.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e and many other convincing ob&s;ervations Mr. Locke has made, in his letter concerning tole|ration; but I have a greater authority than his to produce again&s;t the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures; even that of Zion's King, who compares the &s;etting up of his kingdom in the world to the &s;owing of good &s;eed in a field; after which an enemy &s;ows tares; which when the &s;ervants di&s;covered, they were for gathering up the tares, but he &s;aid, <HI>Nay; le&s;t, while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them: let both grow together until the harve&s;t.</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="011556_0012_0F8721645B6EACB0">
Which parable he has explained &s;o plainly, that we may well be a&s;toni&s;hed at the conduct of &s;ome who pretend to be his &s;ervants, and yet dare to contra|dict him; &s;o much that the field which he &s;ays is <HI>the world,</HI> they &s;ay, is the <HI>church:</HI> according to which, if any <HI>appear by their fruits</HI> to be children of the <HI>wicked one,</HI> they mu&s;t &s;till let them alone in the church, in&s;tead of <HI>putting away</HI> from among them&s;elves &s;uch wicked per&s;ons, as he has com|manded, 1 Cor. 5.13. While they &s;tir up the civil magi&s;trate to <HI>root up</HI> or puni&s;h &s;uch of their neigh|bours in <HI>the world,</HI> as will not &s;upport their religi|ous &s;chemes. Here then, though we &s;uppo&s;e we might lay as ju&s;t a claim to the character of loyal &s;ubjects, and good chri&s;tians, as our neighbours; yet let them &s;uppo&s;e the be&s;t for them&s;elves, and the wor&s;t for us that they po&s;&s;ibly can; let them call them&s;elves children of the kingdom, and us children of the wicked one, and at the &s;ame time forcibly deprive us of any of our worldly goods and privi|leges, becau&s;e we don't conform to their religion; how can they an&s;wer it before the king of Kings, and lord of Lords! How dreadfully do they run upon the &s;word which proceedeth out of his mouth, that &s;ays, "Let both grow together until the harve&s;t!"</P>
<P>I am very far from charging this upon any whole body of people, and fully believe that there are many of the common denomination in this country who truly regard the rights of con&s;cience, and abhor op|pre&s;&s;ion; and in many places our people enjoy li|berty and live in peaceable good neighbourhood with others; yet the violations of the rights of mankind are &s;o great in other places, that it is high time that &s;omething was more effectually done again&s;t them, than has ever yet been done in our land; for tho&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="011556_0013_0F8721651ADA7748">
which have been called laws in our favour, have never been enforced with penalties which has emboldned many to break them; and indeed Mr. Locke &s;ays, "laws are of no force at all without penalties."</P>
<P>Some would accu&s;e us of being enemies to our country, becau&s;e we move in the&s;e things now; though if regard to our country had not prevailed above our private intere&s;ts, po&s;&s;ibly the court of Great-Britain would have heard our complaints be|fore this time: However, let our accu&s;ors turn the tables, let them hear their oppre&s;&s;ors exclaiming from year to year again&s;t being taxed without their own con&s;ent, and again&s;t the &s;cheme of impo&s;ing epi&s;co|pacy upon them; while the &s;ame per&s;ons impo&s;e crually upon their neighbours, and force large &s;ums from them to uphold a wor&s;hip which they con&s;ci|entiou&s;ly di&s;&s;ent from, and then &s;ee if they will &s;it &s;till until their oppre&s;&s;ors have got fully e&s;tabli&s;hed in their power, before they &s;eek deliverance from their yoke; for this is truly our ca&s;e. And as the honorable Edward Goddard, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> (who was for|merly one of his Maje&s;ty's council for this province, and who&s;e motto adorns our title page) &s;ays,
<Q><L>LORD majority would claim the pur&s;e,</L>
<L>For his incumbants: than which nothing wor&s;e,</L>
<L>LORDLY dioce&s;an, him&s;elf, can claim:</L>
<L>So the&s;e two Lords do differ but in name.</L>
<L>One pleading Engli&s;h laws, for his &s;upport;</L>

<P>AT a church-meeting Augu&s;t 11. 1767. It was de&s;ired that Mr. Abraham Lord give his rea|&s;ons of ab&s;enting from the communion of this church. And 1&s;t. He &s;aid, That he could not approve of the church's admitting many per&s;ons to have bap|ti&s;m for their children who are of various characters, as he &s;aid they did; and that he did not know of any di&s;tinction between owning the covenant and coming into communion, and believed there was but one covenant. 2dly.

<P>BEloved in Chri&s;t, as I have no de&s;ire nor intent to give any offence in the lea&s;t, I hope you will look on my reque&s;t as rea&s;onable, in de&s;iring a di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion from this church to the Bapti&s;t church in Berwick. I have revealed my mind to one of the Elders of this church, and have waited &s;ome time, and have had no return. I will let you know the rea&s;on why I in&s;i&s;t on it. I cannot &s;it ea&s;y here in your debaring one of the members of this church from the holy fellow&s;hip of the Lord's &s;upper, and from all &s;pecial ordinances and privileges of this church. You have intirely &s;hut me out who am of the &s;ame way of thinking; for tying the con&s;ci|ence in &s;piritual things is wor&s;e than parting with earthly enjoyments. As to the doctrines and di&s;ci|pline of the Bapti&s;t church, as far as I can conceive, it is agreable to the word of God, and nece&s;&s;ary for my &s;alvation; and to be plain, I cannot benefit here as I would de&s;ire. I am willing to take your re|&s;ults, as you &s;hall think fit: As for commendati|ons I look for none, knowing my &s;elf to be an un|worthy creature. I beg your prayers for me, and though we cannot join in &s;erving God here, I hope we &s;hall all meet at the right hand of God, and there prai&s;e Him to all eternity.

<HEAD>(Their An&s;wer.)</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To Mrs. Elizabeth Lord, member of the church of Chri&s;t in the north pari&s;h in Berwick.</HEAD>
<P>BEloved &s;i&s;ter in Chri&s;t, your letter to us of April la&s;t has been laid before us, and we have con|&s;idered thereon: And though an an&s;wer thereto has been delayed for a con&s;iderable time, yet we would not have you think that it is through a neglect of you; but it was thought proper that &s;ome previous &s;teps &s;hould be taken before a po&s;itive an&s;wer was given; as we would leave no &s;uitable chri&s;tian means untried to remove what we e&s;teem your fal&s;e opinions, which are grounds of your reque&s;t of a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. And indeed the &s;ubject of your letter is &s;uch, and your mind is (as we conceive) &s;o much turned a&s;ide from the truth, that after labouring with you to reclaim you by a committee of the church, it may be con&s;idered as a prudential act, and an act of kindne&s;s and tenderne&s;s to you to de|lay an an&s;wer, that you might have opportunity to think better of the &s;ubject, and to return to your duty before you had wholly gone off and for&s;aken the communion of the church of Chri&s;t, with which you &s;olemnly covenanted: praying that God would lead you into the truth, and deliver you from error; we hope that you do by this time at lea&s;t begin to think better.</P>
<P>As to the principal &s;ubject of your letter, which is your reque&s;ting a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from this church, to the Bapti&s;t church in this town, we having met twice and deliberated thereon, judged it incon&s;i&s;tent with our covenant-engagements and chri&s;tian com|munion; accordingly voted, That we cannot &s;ee our way clear to comply with your reque&s;t, by giving
<PB N="18" REF="011556_0017_0F872169E760E6F0">
you a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from this church to the Bapti&s;t church in this town.&mdash;There are &s;everal rea&s;ons which (as they appear to us) render it improper and what we ought not to comply with, to give you a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion in the manner which you reque&s;t.&mdash;1&s;t. We cannot but e&s;teem your motives thereto, in part at lea&s;t, to be very wrong, and that you labour un|der a very mi&s;taken apprehen&s;ion of things in the rea&s;ons which you give therefor.&mdash;You &s;ay, the rea&s;on why you in&s;i&s;t on it is, That you cannot &s;it ea&s;y here; and that the rea&s;on that you cannot &s;it ea&s;y here is, that we have debated one of the mem|bers of this church from our communion, or to that purpo&s;e; whereby you &s;ay, we have &s;hut you out, who are of the &s;ame way of thinking. We mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that you mean your Hu&s;band, when you &s;peak of one of the members of this church being debared, with whom you &s;ay, you are of the &s;ame way of thinking. But if you think that he was de|bared for any opinion at all, you have quite mi&s;took the thing:&mdash;It was not for one opinion more than another, but for the neglect of an important chri&s;tian duty, viz. attending upon the Lord's &s;upper, a neg|lect which had long been per&s;i&s;ted in, while you continued to commune with the church therein:&mdash; And it was for this neglect, and not for any diffe|rent opinions, that we dealt with him in a way of di&s;cipline, as we thought it to be our duty from our obligations of a brotherly watch for his good to edi|fication. As to his differing from us in his &s;enti|ments about Bapti&s;m, he did indeed at the church-meeting ju&s;t &s;ugge&s;t that he began to think diffe|rently, or was under &s;ome doubt, but did not in&s;i&s;t on it at all as a rea&s;on for his ab&s;enting from our communion before:&mdash;His being &s;u&s;pended does not
<PB N="19" REF="011556_0018_0F87216B36E442E8">
therefore at all relate to you, or &s;hut you out from the enjoyment of any and all the ordinances and privileges of the church; unle&s;s you are affected with it merely becau&s;e he &s;tands in the relation to you of your hu&s;band. But if that is the ca&s;e, we mu&s;t tell you that we think you are very wrong therein; for in Chri&s;t's kingdom we are not to be influenced by any &s;uch relations; but to deny and for&s;ake them all as to acts of &s;piritual communion, if his honor and the truth and purity of his go&s;pel require it. To this purpo&s;e is that &s;aying of Chri&s;t in Luke 14.26. "If any man come to me, and hate not his father &amp; mother, and wife and children, brethren and &s;i&s;ters, yea, and his own life al&s;o, he cannot be my di&s;ciple." Which <HI>hating</HI> can mean nothing &s;hort of a di&s;regard of them in compari&s;on of Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel, and a hearty readine&s;s to oppo&s;e them, and bear te&s;timony again&s;t them, wherein they for&s;ake the truth and their duty: We conceive therefore that your motive for leaving us ari&s;ing from hence, is very wrong. And if you are di&s;po&s;ed in any mea&s;ure to change your opinion, or to think more favourably of the Bapti&s;t principles, or to leave us and go to them on account of the cen&s;ure pa&s;t upon your hu&s;band, you are certainly quite wrong therein, in not being led by truth, but by partiality and prejudice in favour, which you ought not to be governed by. We do not &s;ay that this is the ca&s;e with you, but advi&s;e you to examine your&s;elf.</P>
<P>As to what you &s;ay of <HI>tying the con&s;cience in &s;piritual things,</HI> we can hardly think what you re|fer to.&mdash; It is what we intirely di&s;allow and prote&s;t again&s;t, and are not &s;en&s;ible of doing it; but if you can convince us of having done it we are ready to
<PB N="20" REF="011556_0019_0F87216BD4E25428">
remove that objection: You cannot therefore have any rea&s;on or motive from hence to for&s;ake us.&mdash; Liberty of con&s;cience we claim our&s;elves and allow others, as a darling point; and therefore mu&s;t not be <HI>forced</HI> to do any thing contrary to <HI>our</HI> con&s;ciences, nor be thought to tye the con&s;ciences of others by <HI>not con&s;enting</HI> to what we cannot think to be for the honor of God and intere&s;t of religion.</P>
<P>As to your opinion concerning the doctrines and di&s;cipline of the Bapti&s;t church, both that they are agreable to the word of God, and nece&s;&s;ary for your &s;alvation, we are truly &s;orry for your mi&s;take, and that you appear to be &s;o uncharitable, by &s;aying, what &s;eems to cut off the whole Chri&s;tian world, except the few who are of the &s;ect of the Bapti&s;ts from your charity and hope of their &s;alvation: But we tru&s;t that if you carefully and &s;eriou&s;ly attend to and con&s;ider this opinion with its con&s;equences, you will not abide by it: We tru&s;t you would not de|&s;ignedly &s;ay or do what would &s;hut out from &s;alva|tion or deny &s;alvation to the apo&s;tles who baptized whole hou&s;holds upon the faith of the head or heads of the family, or deny the &s;alvation of tho&s;e who were baptized by them, and of all the primitive chri&s;tians who (according to ancient hi&s;tory) for three or four centuries univer&s;ally practi&s;ed infant-bapti&s;m, and none denied it. Which that it was practi&s;ed by the apo&s;tles and primitive chri&s;tians may be al&s;o concluded from the univer&s;ality of the practice ever &s;ince, and at this day among all the &s;ectaries of whatever denomination in Chri&s;tendom, except the &s;mall &s;ect of the Bapti&s;ts, comparatively with the whole &s;mall indeed: For however &s;ome of the other &s;ectaries have warped off from the go&s;|pel in other re&s;pects, yet they all agree in this, who
<PB N="21" REF="011556_0020_0F87217135006F88">
hold to any outward ordinances, viz. The bapti&s;m of infants as being of divine right and authority. And the univer&s;ality of agreement in this practice among all &s;ectaries, how different &s;oever, &amp; oppo&s;ite to one another, except the few Bapti&s;ts, &s;trongly argues in all rea&s;on that it is a practice of early date, and took its ri&s;e with the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, that it was taught and practi&s;ed by the fir&s;t founders of it. We tru&s;t you would not deny the &s;alvation of all who have practi&s;ed and do &s;till practi&s;e infant-bapti&s;m and &s;prinkling; among whom (if we judge by the pro|per evidences and marks of true piety and &s;anctifi|cation) there have been and are &s;till many, not only real chri&s;tians, but eminent chri&s;tians, and among whom there have been many eminent mini&s;ters, whom God has evidently own'd and ble&s;s'd, and which way God has evidently own'd and ble&s;s'd by bringing home many &s;ouls therein. It &s;eems there|fore that God him&s;elf does not e&s;teem the doctrines and di&s;cipline of the Bapti&s;t church to be nece&s;&s;ary for &s;alvation, wherein they differ from us, and that he has made it appear that they were not nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;alvation of the primitive chri&s;tians, or chri|&s;tians of later ages, or chri&s;tians of the&s;e days. You &s;eem indeed aware of this even while you de&s;ire a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from us to the Bapti&s;t church, and ex|pre&s;s that you think their doctrines and di&s;cipline to be nece&s;&s;ary for your &s;alvation; this appears in your &s;tiling us, <HI>Beloved in Chri&s;t, de&s;iring our prayers for you, and hoping that we and you &s;hall meet at the right hand of God, and prai&s;e him to all eternity:</HI> All which are expre&s;&s;ive of your charity for us, and hope of our &s;alvation in the way that we are in, as you &s;ay, <HI>Though we cannot join in &s;erving God here, I hope,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;We mu&s;t put you in mind of your
<PB N="22" REF="011556_0021_0F8721903AF8BDA0">
incon&s;i&s;tency, and therefore your error in this point, regarding not &s;o much an incon&s;i&s;tency in writing as in your &s;entiments and practice: You &s;tile us, <HI>Beloved in Chri&s;t, de&s;ire our prayers for you,</HI> and hope we &s;hall meet together at God's right hand, and yet de&s;ire to leave us, intimate that you cannot have communion with us, and that you think other and different doctrines and di&s;cipline from what we receive and practi&s;e are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, that is, to <HI>your</HI> &s;alvation, which term <HI>nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alva|tion,</HI> implies that you think that you cannot obtain &s;alvation without embracing tho&s;e doctrines and that di&s;cipline: But how is it that they are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for your &s;alvation, when &s;o many people have been chri&s;tians, and have been &s;aved, and others may yet be &s;aved in a different way, and you your&s;elf expre&s;s your charity for us as <HI>chri&s;tians,</HI> and hope of our &s;alvation, who do not embrace tho&s;e doctrines and that di&s;cipline, and continuing not to embrace them? Why are they &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for your &s;alvation, and not at all nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;alvation of others? Or why, if we are chri&s;tians and beloved in Chri&s;t, and a true church of Chri&s;t, [<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Mr. Lord and his wife declare is not true.</NOTE> as you expre&s;t your&s;elf in your letter, and private conver&s;ation to the church's committee compared together]&mdash;if &s;o, why do you de&s;ire to leave us, why can't you have communion with us, why can't you &s;it ea&s;y here, how can you e&s;teem other and different doctrines and di&s;cipline nece&s;&s;ary to your &s;alvation, and by renouncing your bapti&s;m, and all your former profe&s;&s;ions, do that which will deny any communion with us, and that we have any right to the name of a church of Chri&s;t? Can your views of things be right, can your motives be good, which induce you to do this? Can they
<PB N="23" REF="011556_0022_0F87219196253C38">
be approved of God? How can you lay &s;uch a &s;tumbling-block before the children of God, the church of Chri&s;t, even &s;o large a body of his di&s;ci|ples, as the whole number of tho&s;e who practi&s;e infant-bapti&s;m and &s;prinkling? If our <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> is null and void in the &s;ight of God, then our mini&s;try and ordinances are &s;o too, a meet nullity, or what is much wor&s;e, a profanation; God therefore does not own them nor concur with them in his influences, there can therefore be no hope of our &s;alvation in our way of admini&s;tration. Whatever excu&s;es you may be &s;o kind as charitably to make for us on account of our want of light, and labouring under the pre|judices of education, &s;o as to hope that we may be accepted and &s;aved; yet, alas! they won't help us: But your profe&s;&s;ed principles and practice in re|nouncing your infant-bapti&s;m [if our character and final &s;tate was to be determined according to them] would not only &s;hut us out of a church-&s;tate, but out of heaven it&s;elf; we could not hope to receive a ble&s;&s;ing in our way of admini&s;tration, or to be ac|cepted of God to eternal life, per&s;i&s;ting therein. If it be indeed, as the plain language of your new prin|ciples expre&s;s, or (in other words) if your new opi|nions be true according to the go&s;pel, there is no hope for us per&s;i&s;ting in the way that we are in:&mdash; But to &s;upport our confidence, we may &s;afely &s;ay, If our method of admini&s;tration of ordinances is not valid, and God does not own them, he never own'd any in the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, and hath no true church upon earth, as we have the witne&s;s of mul|titudes, who well evidenced their faith, and the blood of martyrs in various ages in our favour; yea mul|titudes of tho&s;e who were in our way of admini&s;tra|tion, who bore te&s;timony to the truth of the religion
<PB N="24" REF="011556_0023_0F872192128C4E68">
which they profe&s;&s;ed unto the death, triumphing over that la&s;t enemy in the &s;ure and lively hope of glory: To which we think we may add, the wit|ne&s;s of the holy Spirit to us in his concurring influ|ences and ble&s;&s;ing with the word and ordinances; from whence we firmly conclude that he owns them.</P>
<P>We &s;uppo&s;e indeed that you think your&s;elf to have been a chri&s;tian for a number of years; if &s;o we tru&s;t you won't deny the agency of the Spirit of God in making you a chri&s;tian: And his ordi|nary way of operation is in the way of the means of his own appointment; and no doubt he acted con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, and in his u&s;ual way of ope|ration, when you was brought home, if indeed you be a chri&s;tian; which was while you continued un|der the admini&s;tration of ordinances, which we pro|fe&s;s and practi&s;e: In con&s;equence of which opera|tion [we &s;uppo&s;e] you was induced to join in full communion with the church in this way, and &s;o continued for a number of years without a difficulty upon your con&s;cience as to your bapti&s;m, that we were ever &s;en&s;ible of. You will perhaps &s;ay, that you have &s;ince gained farther light as to the ordi|nance of bapti&s;m, and find that you are &s;till unbap|tized: But can that be <HI>true light</HI> which induces you to renounce your bapti&s;m, and that admini&s;tration of ordinances, as a meer nullity or profanation, which God has thus owned and ble&s;&s;ed? To you, or that mini&s;try, in attendance upon which God has be&s;towed upon you his &s;aving influences, and en|lightned you with the light of life? To &s;uppo&s;e that the Spirit of God who owned the admini&s;tration of ordinances which we practi&s;e, does now lead you to renounce your bapti&s;m, this admini&s;tration of ordinances and the&s;e churches, is to &s;uppo&s;e that
<PB N="25" REF="011556_0024_0F8721982DC05378">
the Spirit of God acts contradictorily to him&s;elf, and owns two directly contrary methods of admini&s;tra|tion, one of which being a total &s;ubver&s;ion or over|throw of the other: Which &s;uppo&s;ition needs no farther confutation, than the bare mentioning of it. Therefore, unle&s;s you can deny that God did ever concur in his influences, and afford his ble&s;&s;ing with our method of admini&s;tration, either to you or o|thers, you are con&s;trained and bound to confe&s;s that you are not now led by the Spirit of God in re|nouncing your bapti&s;m, and therewith our admini|&s;tration, ordinances and churches: And if you are not led by the Spirit of God herein, which operates in and by the word and mini&s;try of his own appoint|ment, you are certainly wandering out of the paths of truth, in the wilderne&s;s of error, in this re&s;pect, wherein you have lo&s;t the true guide, in renouncing the admini&s;tration which God owns. Therefore as you acknowledge and own us in your language as chri&s;tians, and a true church of Chri&s;t, and that we may be &s;aved in our way, the incon&s;i&s;tency of your practice, we mu&s;t think, is a proof of your error in tho&s;e &s;entiments, and that practice which denies any communion with us, and virtually &s;peaks and &s;ays, That we are in a &s;tate of Heatheni&s;m, that we have not &s;o much as the vi&s;ible &s;igns, and de&s;erve not the name of a church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And we have farther to add, 2dly. That we e&s;teem the <HI>act</HI> of your leaving us and going off to the Bap|ti&s;t church, and complying with what they demand of being re-baptized, to be very wrong. Bapti&s;m, if it is con&s;idered in &s;cripture light, we conceive is to be e&s;teemed an initiating ordinance, a &s;ign and &s;eal of initiation or introduction into the vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t; and as &s;uch it is not to be repeated. It
<PB N="26" REF="011556_0025_0F87219A14F22EC0">
is ab&s;urd, as common &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on teaches, to &s;uppo&s;e two initiations by the &s;ame &s;ign. If a per|&s;on has been once initiated by bapti&s;m into the vi&s;ible church, he is then a member of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible king|dom; and however he may fall away and apo&s;ta|tize by &s;in or neglect of his duty, &s;o as to forfeit the charity of the church, and &s;o to require a public profe&s;&s;ion of repentance and &s;olemn renewal of his engagements to be the Lord's, in order to be re|&s;tored to the church's charity; yet all this does not di&s;&s;olve his bapti&s;mal bonds, and his relation to the church as a baptized per&s;on, or render him unbap|tized, whether that ordinance was admini&s;tred in in|fancy or adult years. It is in the nature of it an outward ordinance, and &s;o far as it is an outward &s;ign of initiation, it is never to be repeated when it is once performed. When Simon the &s;orcerer fell after his bapti&s;m, and appeared to be an unbeliever, in the gall of bitterne&s;s and in the bond of iniquity, the apo&s;tle exhorts him to repent of his wickedne&s;s, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of his heart may be forgiven him; but he &s;ays not a word about his being baptized again. See Acts 8. Whereas his ex|hortations to tho&s;e who were unbaptized were, <HI>Re|pent and be baptized,</HI> Acts 2.38. If you &s;hould &s;ay, That you was baptized in <HI>infancy,</HI> when you <HI>knew nothing of it,</HI> and was not capable of <HI>believing,</HI> and that it is therefore null and void: It may be an&s;wered, That your want of faith did not di&s;annul your bapti&s;m as an outward &s;ign, any more than Simon's unbelief di&s;annulled his bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Your bapti&s;m (we may add) is no more di&s;an|nulled by its being done in your infancy, than the circumci&s;ion of the Jewi&s;h children at eight days old was rendred null and void by its being done in their

As God did once expre&s;ly command, viz. that under the old di&s;pen&s;ation of the covenant of grace, that the infant &s;eed of his vi&s;ible people &s;hould be initiated into his vi&s;ible church by an out|ward &s;ign; and as he has under the new di&s;pen&s;a|tion not di&s;annulled their right to the covenant &s;eal, but on the contrary given us &s;trong rea&s;on to con|clude the continuance of the &s;ame right to that &s;ign which is now the &s;eal of the covenant, the &s;eal of initiation, by various pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, particu|larly in &s;tiling the children <HI>holy,</HI> one or both of who&s;e parents are believers, 1 Cor. 7.14. not meaning (as we &s;uppo&s;e) an inherent holine&s;s, or holine&s;s of na|ture, but a faederal or covenant holine&s;s, as being of the number of God's people, as being the chil|dren of the covenant;&mdash;from the&s;e con&s;iderations, as well as other rea&s;ons which fall in with the&s;e, &s;ome of which have been hinted at in the cour&s;e of this letter, we think we are bound to hold the bapti&s;m of infants to be of divine right and authority, and think that the validity of their bapti&s;m, when once baptized, cannot be denied: therefore your bapti&s;m,

we conceive, is not on this account to be repeated. We are &s;en&s;ible that there is great &s;tre&s;s laid upon the particular mode of bapti&s;m by <HI>plunging,</HI> by &s;ome of the &s;ect of the Bapti&s;ts; who &s;ay, That bapti&s;m by <HI>&s;prinkling</HI> is of it&s;elf null and void on account of the mode, and that it is no bapti&s;m:&mdash;But is it there|fore no bapti&s;m, becau&s;e it is bapti&s;m performed by &s;prinkling, or pouring water on the per&s;on, and not by dipping him all over therein? And do you think your bapti&s;m to be no bapti&s;m on that account? And is it for this rea&s;on that you &s;ay, that the doctrines and di&s;cipline of the Bapti&s;t church, as far as you can conceive, are nece&s;&s;ary for your &s;alvation? This is truly to make the particular mode of bapti&s;m by plunging to be e&s;&s;ential, both e&s;&s;ential to bapti&s;m and to &s;alvation.&mdash;But by what authority do you make &s;uch a particular mode of bapti&s;m one of the e&s;&s;en|tials of religion, e&s;&s;ential to bapti&s;m, and to &s;alvati|on? Have you your authority therefor from the &s;cripture? Has Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles ever &s;aid &s;o ex|pre&s;ly, or &s;aid that from whence you may without any doubt infer it, and affirm it to be in the above &s;en&s;e e&s;&s;ential, &s;o as to declare all tho&s;e who are not baptized in this way, but are baptized by &s;prinkling to be unbaptized per&s;ons, and in a &s;tate of heathen|i&s;m, a &s;tate of e&s;trangement from God and from the promi&s;es and privileges of the covenant of grace, &s;o as to &s;hut them out of the church and of Chri&s;t, and therefore out of heaven? As this principle holds. We are fully per&s;uaded that you don't find Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles &s;aying any &s;uch thing:&mdash;But if it had been e&s;&s;ential, don't you think that Chri&s;t in his boundle&s;s wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s to mankind, and his church would have clearly revealed his mind and will to us in that point, in his revelation which he com|mitted

to his church? No doubt he would,&mdash;as we have rea&s;on to ble&s;s his name that he has given us &s;ufficient rea&s;on to think that every thing nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation is clearly and plainly revealed in the written revelation which God has of his abundant mercy given us.&mdash;"To the law, therefore, and to the te&s;timony; if they &s;peak not according to this word, it is becau&s;e there is no light in them." <HI>I&s;a.</HI> viii. 20. We would therefore remind you that it is dangerous making things e&s;&s;ential, which Chri&s;t has not made &s;o, and making other laws, rules and terms of communion, be&s;ides tho&s;e which Chri&s;t has made and enjoined:&mdash;This is to u&s;urp the throne, the prerogative and authority of Chri&s;t, the only king and lawgiver of his church, and is al&s;o an high affront to his wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>That water-bapti&s;m is an ordinance of Chri&s;t un|der the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, we firmly believe, as Chri&s;t has been plea&s;ed clearly to reveal it to be &s;o: But as to the particular manner of admini&s;tring it, whether by dipping or pouring water on a per&s;on, or &s;prinkling, we find nothing expre&s;s in the in&s;ti|tution, and think that Chri&s;t has left no po&s;itive com|mand re&s;pecting it, leaving us at liberty to perform it either way as &s;eem to us mo&s;t convenient, and that we have full liberty to u&s;e either way of admini&s;tra|tion without giving offence to any chri&s;tian, without giving occa&s;ion to any to withdraw from our com|munion, or incurring the cen&s;ure of any as un|baptized per&s;ons, in a &s;tate of heatheni&s;m, having no regular mini&s;try or ordinances, and having no right to the name and privileges of a church of Chri&s;t; which is the plain con&s;equence of holding that bap|ti&s;m by plunging is the only bapti&s;m, that bapti&s;m by &s;prinkling is null and void, and is no chri&s;tian
<PB N="30" REF="011556_0029_0F87219CA2961870">
bapti&s;m; as you &s;ignified is your opinion.&mdash;We don't &s;ay, that bapti&s;m was never admini&s;tred by John Bapti&s;t, or by the apo&s;tles, by <HI>dipping,</HI> though we are per&s;uaded that it was not always, as where it appears, that &s;ome were baptized in the hou&s;e, and where great numbers were baptized in a day; upon which occa&s;ions dipping would be attended with great inconvenience, or even an impo&s;&s;ibility: We are per&s;uaded therefore that dipping is not e&s;&s;ential to the ordinance, but that &s;prinkling of water on a per&s;on in bapti&s;m, is fully warrantable by &s;cripture, that it was at lea&s;t &s;ometimes practi&s;ed by the apo|&s;tles and primitive chri&s;tians, and is upon the whole to be cho&s;en, as being agreable to the mind of Chri&s;t, and that in <HI>&s;ome</HI> ca&s;es at lea&s;t it <HI>ought</HI> to be u&s;ed; as when the other mode would be impracticable, or be attended with great inconvenience or danger of health.</P>
<P>But as to the practice of John Bapti&s;t, allowing that he baptized by dipping only, <HI>that,</HI> we conceive, is nothing to the pre&s;ent mode of bapti&s;m; for his bapti&s;m was not the chri&s;tian bapti&s;m, for the chri|&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation had not then taken place in the world, it being the bapti&s;m of repentance introduc|tory to it, and practi&s;ed before Chri&s;t entred upon his public mini&s;try, &s;ee Matt. 3d and 4th chapters. It was not therefore the bapti&s;m of the new and chri|&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, Chri&s;t not having yet in&s;tituted it: Hence the boa&s;ted argument comes to nothing at all, which &s;ome u&s;e to prove the nece&s;&s;ity of being baptized by <HI>dipping, That it is a following the ex|ample of Chri&s;t,</HI> who they &s;ay, was baptized in that manner by John Bapti&s;t in Jordan, as it is &s;aid, <HI>That he went up out of the water:</HI> For that was not the bapti&s;m of the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, and therefore it
<PB N="31" REF="011556_0030_0F87219D55672810">
is no proof or evidence that he de&s;igned that we &s;hould follow him in that particular mode of bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>As Chri&s;t has not enjoined the particular mode of bapti&s;m, but has left us at liberty to u&s;e either plung|ing or &s;prinkling, or pouring water on the per&s;on to be baptized, we think bapti&s;m by dipping is <HI>lawful</HI> according to the &s;cripture, though we don't think it enjoined or commanded; and if any per&s;on ap|peared con&s;cientiou&s;ly to choo&s;e it, we could with a good con&s;cience con&s;ent to the admi&s;&s;ion of members into our church, by their being baptized in that way, in ca&s;e they had not been baptized at all. But to e&s;teem it e&s;&s;ential, or to admit a per&s;on to be bap|tized by dipping, who had been baptized by &s;prink|ling, we cannot. And indeed for a per&s;on that has been once baptized by &s;prinkling, to renounce that bapti&s;m and be baptized by dipping, is at lea&s;t a trif|ling with the &s;acred ordinance, and is but little, if any, &s;hort of a profanation of it; and if you &s;ince you have been baptized by &s;prinkling, have renew|ed your bapti&s;mal covenant, and have communed with the church of Chri&s;t, &s;hould renounce all your former engagements to receive bapti&s;m by dipping, we e&s;teem it that you would be guilty of great &s;in herein, even a trifling with or a meer profanation of &s;acred things. And if you are a chri&s;tian, yet your conduct herein mu&s;t be reckoned among tho&s;e works, which are &s;tiled <HI>wood, hay, &s;tubble,</HI> which &s;hall be burnt, by which you will &s;uffer lo&s;s. And we can|not e&s;teem it for the honor of God, for the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t's kingdom, or the &s;afety of &s;ouls, that the &s;ect of the Bapti&s;ts, e&s;pecially &s;ome of them, go a|bout urging tho&s;e who have already been baptized by &s;prinkling, to be re-baptized by dipping, thus teaching for doctrines the commandments of men,

as that mu&s;t be of man, which is not taken from the word of God, as enjoined there, and thus mak|ing the commandment of God, the in&s;titution au|thori&s;ed by God, of none effect by their traditions.</P>
<P>To conclude this our reply to your letter, we &s;hall only add, 3dly. That however your mind may be &s;o turned a&s;ide from the truth, as to think that you &s;hall do right, to renounce your bapti&s;m to be re-baptized by being dipped, to for&s;ake this church with whom you have &s;olemnly covenanted to walk in chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip, and to go off from us to the Bapti&s;t church, yet we do not think it to be our duty to <HI>con&s;ent</HI> thereto, by giving you a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from us to that church; but we think it to be our duty to <HI>deny</HI> it, to <HI>bear te&s;timony again&s;t</HI> your &s;o doing, and &s;olemnly to warn you again&s;t it.&mdash;We e&s;teem it no &s;mall matter for a per&s;on to &s;eperate from a church in any manner, with which he or &s;he has &s;olemnly covenanted to walk in chri&s;tian fellow|&s;hip; an act which nothing but very weighty and grievous things lying upon the con&s;cience, which they cannot remedy, can ju&s;tify: But to add to this the renouncing the bapti&s;mal tran&s;action and bonds, and all that a per&s;on has done to lay him&s;elf under obli|gations, all his profe&s;&s;ions and all that God has done for him heretofore, to be baptized by dipping, thereby practically declaring all the churches of o|ther denominations to be no churches of Chri&s;t, this mu&s;t be attended with peculiar and very great aggravations. Hereby the body of Chri&s;t is bro|ken and torn, his members wounded and grieved, many whom you your&s;elf cannot deny to be chri&s;ti|ans <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed</HI> as being unbaptized, having no true churches, mini&s;try or ordinances, and thereby is thrown a &s;tumbling-block in the way of the di&s;ci|ples

of Chri&s;t: And on whom mu&s;t the guilt here|of lie? Mu&s;t it not lie on you?</P>
<P>If you can <HI>&s;atisfy your&s;elf</HI> as to doing this, we repeat it, that <HI>we cannot con&s;ent</HI> to it; we think it incon&s;i&s;tent with our duty to God our heavenly Father, to Chri&s;t our Lord and Redeemer, and to you our &s;i&s;ter in the Lord, to withdraw our brotherly watch from you, and con&s;ent to your going off to a church with which we are not in communion as a church, it being &s;et up in an irregular manner; we think we &s;hould be guilty of great want of love, of brotherly tenderne&s;s and care &s;o to do.

<P>We have a hope for you that you have built upon the true foundation, even Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but caution you not to build thereon this, <HI>wood, hay, &s;tubble,</HI> le&s;t you &s;uffer lo&s;s by your works being burnt.&mdash;We hope and pray that God will purge you from any tincture of error, and lead you into all truth, that you may continue in the faith, grounded and &s;ettled, and that you may be filled with the knowledge of God's will in all wi&s;dom and &s;piritual under&s;tanding; and re&s;t your Brethren in Chri&s;t,</P>

<P>BEING by divine Providence brought into this place, and being called to baptize Mr. Abra|ham Lord, and his wife, I thought it my duty to inquire into their character, as well as their princi|ples and experiences; and finding that he is under a cen&s;ure of your church for withdrawing from your communion, and that &s;he has had a long letter of warning and reproof from you, in an&s;wer to one that &s;he wrote to reque&s;t a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from you to the Bapti&s;t Church in this town, it appeared to me expedient to return you &s;ome an&s;wer thereto: In doing of which I &s;hall endeavour,</P>

<P N="1">I&s;t. To give the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e between us; it is plainly this: We hold that bapti&s;m was in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t to be admini&s;tred only to them who give go&s;pel evidence of their being true believ|ers; and to be admini&s;tred to &s;uch by <HI>burying</HI> in

water, and not by pouring or &s;prinkling. But you hold infants as well as believers to be &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m; and that <Q>Chri&s;t has not enjoined the particular mode of bapti&s;m, but has left us at li|berty to u&s;e either plunging or &s;prinkling, or pouring water on the per&s;on to be baptized.</Q> This being the plain &s;tate of the ca&s;e, I will proceed,</P>
<P N="2">IIdly. To con&s;ider your method of &s;upporting your principles. And here, 1. You beg the very que&s;tion in debate; for you &s;ay, <Q>The apo&s;tles baptized whole hou&s;holds <HI>upon the faith</HI> of the head or heads of the family;</Q> and that, <Q>All the primitive chri&s;tians (according to ancient hi&s;|tory) for three or four centuries univer&s;ally practi&s;|ed infant bapti&s;m, and none denied it.</Q> Whereas the very point in di&s;pute is, Whether the apo&s;tles baptized any <HI>upon the faith</HI> of the head of the fa|mily or not? And for you to &s;ay they did without proof, is a notorious begging of the que&s;tion. As for the Jaylor's hou&s;e, the &s;cripture is expre&s;s that they <HI>&s;pake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his hou&s;e:</HI> And that he rejoiced, <HI>believing in God with all his hou&s;e,</HI> Act. 16.32, 34. And the hou&s;e of Lydia are called <HI>brethren,</HI> who were <HI>comforted</HI> by the apo&s;tles, ver. 40. And the hou&s;hold of Stephanus, were the <HI>fir&s;t fruits of Achaia,</HI> and <HI>addicted them&s;elves to the mini&s;try of the &s;aints,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.16. and 16.15. All which plainly be-&s;peak their acting by their own faith, and not being baptized upon others faith; and the&s;e are the plain|e&s;t in&s;tances of hou&s;hold bapti&s;m, that we have in the Bible. And as to the primitive chri&s;tians, in|&s;tead of their univer&s;ally practi&s;ing infant-bapti&s;m, according to ancient hi&s;tory, it appears that we never have it named until the third century, and then St.
<PB N="37" REF="011556_0035_0F8721A4128CAC28">
<HI>Origen,</HI> who is one of the fir&s;t that appeared for it, &s;ays, <Q>It is for that rea&s;on, becau&s;e by the &s;acrament of bapti&s;m the <HI>pollution of our birth is taken a|way,</HI> that infants are baptized.</Q> See Mr. <HI>Peter Clark</HI>'s defence of infant bapti&s;m, again&s;t Dr. <HI>Gill,</HI> pag. 111. And hence they (as appears by Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>'s quotations) frequently called bapti&s;m <HI>Rege|neration,</HI> from a mi&s;taken notion that a being born of water, in John 3.5. meant bapti&s;m: But if pa|rents willingly bringing their children, and mini&s;ters willingly putting water upon them would regenerate them, that would contradict John 1.13. which a&s;&s;ures us, that we are not born again of <HI>blood,</HI> nor <HI>of the will of man, but of God.</HI> And your &s;aying that none denied it, is not truth; for it appears by Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> and others, that <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s appearing again&s;t infant-bapti&s;m, is the fir&s;t expre&s;s account that we have of its ever being practi&s;ed; and by the &s;ame account we find that the u&s;e of <HI>God fathers</HI> and <HI>God-mothers</HI> therein, is of as early date as the practice it&s;elf. The apo&s;tle John tells us, that the <HI>my&s;tery of iniquity</HI> did <HI>already work</HI> in his day; how far then had it prevailed when this cu&s;tom was in|troduced, which, according to <HI>Origen</HI>'s words, was built upon that antichri&s;tian doctrine, That the <HI>&s;acraments confer grace!</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Having thus begged the que&s;tion, you endea|vour to frighten Mrs. Lord from embracing the Bapti&s;t principles, by repre&s;enting that her &s;o doing would virtually <Q>&s;hut out from &s;alvation, or deny &s;alvation to the apo&s;tles,</Q> and to the primitive chri&s;tians, as well as to multitudes &s;ince. This con|&s;equence you endeavour to draw from her &s;aying in her letter to you, that <Q>As to the doctrines and di&s;cipline of the Bapti&s;t church, as far as I can con|ceive,

it is agreable to the word of God, and <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ary for my &s;alvation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But, pray Sirs, who would ever have drawn &s;uch a con&s;equence therefrom, if they had not a preju|diced mind? Her words plainly include all our doctrines and di&s;cipline, and not tho&s;e points only wherein we differ from other chri&s;tians: And do any of you expect to be &s;aved without embracing and conforming to the doctrines and di&s;cipline that you think is agreable to the word of God? Or dare you act contrary to your con&s;ciences for fear of con|demning good men's errors! The apo&s;tle plainly &s;hews, that he that <HI>doubteth</HI> whether a thing be law|ful or not, and yet doeth it, is <HI>damned</HI> or condemn|ed, Rom. 14.23. how much more mu&s;t that per&s;on be &s;o who acts contrary to what he is convinced is right? Mrs. Lord, in her letter, plainly expre&s;t her belief of the &s;alvation of other chri&s;tians, which are not of her &s;entiments about bapti&s;m, while &s;he e|&s;teemed it nece&s;&s;ary for her to act according to the light which God had given her: This you try to repre&s;ent as a great incon&s;i&s;tency, and carry things &s;o far as to &s;ay of your&s;elves, that <Q>If our bapti&s;m is null and void in the &s;ight of God, then our mini&s;try and ordinances are &s;o too, a meer nullity, or what is much wor&s;e, a profanation; God there|fore does not own them nor concur with them in his influences; there can therefore be no hope of our &s;alvation in our way of admini&s;tration.</Q>&mdash; This is a way which has been often u&s;ed to frighten people from &s;eeing with their own eyes, or from acting their own judgments; but I tru&s;t you will allow that circumci&s;ion was as nece&s;&s;ary formerly as bapti&s;m is now, yet will you &s;ay that there was no hope of the &s;alvation of all the I&s;raelites, who were
<PB N="39" REF="011556_0037_0F8721AC95975FD0">
born in the wilderne&s;s for 40 years, who were not circumci&s;ed until after they came over Jordan? Jo&s;h. 5.5. The fea&s;t of Tabernacles, which was one of the greate&s;t ordinances in the Jewi&s;h church, took its name from the mode which God com|manded it to be kept in, yet &s;oon after they were &s;ettled in Canaan, they dropt that mode, and it was not recovered again for above a thou&s;and years, even from Jo&s;hua's time until after their habitations had lain de&s;olate 70 years, Neh. 8.17. Solomon de|dicated the temple at that fea&s;t, though becau&s;e they had dropt the manner of keeping of it, from which it took its name, therefore it is there named only from the time of keeping it, viz. the <HI>&s;eventh month,</HI> 1 Kin. 8.2. Yet how great were the tokens of God's pre&s;ence at that fea&s;t? Can any of you pre|tend to equal evidence of his pre&s;ence in &s;prinkling for bapti&s;m, as I&s;rael had at that fea&s;t? Or to any who have practi&s;ed it, that equalled David for devo|tion, or Solomon for wi&s;dom? Yet the poor cap|tives who returned from Babylon, were not deter'd by &s;uch great characters from returning to an exact conformity to divine rule, Neh. 8.14,&mdash;17. From the&s;e and many other &s;criptures, it appears that God owns and grants his pre&s;ence with his &s;aints, &s;o far as they act in his truth, and yet will not hold them guiltle&s;s in retaining any error, or neglecting to act upon any truth when it is farther opened to them, even though, that error had been held, or that truth neglected by the greate&s;t or be&s;t of men.</P>
<P>The prejudices of education and natural affection are &s;o great, that all the light and power of the day of Pentico&s;t did not convince one of the apo&s;tles that they were to drop circumci&s;ion; and when a|nother vi&s;ion from heaven gave Peter farther light

in the ca&s;e, the re&s;t of the Church <HI>contended with him</HI> about it, until they were convinced al&s;o, Act. 11.2, 18. So I expect our fathers and brethren will do with us about our for&s;aking infant &s;prink|ling, until they are convinced of their error.</P>
<P>All your attempts to prove that either Mrs. Lord had not the Spirit of God with her when &s;he held to infant bapti&s;m, or el&s;e cannot have the &s;ame &s;pi|rit in leaving of it, have not &s;o much colour of rea|&s;on in them, as they might have had who were zea|lous of circumci&s;ion, to &s;ay to Peter, That either he had not the &s;pirit on the day of Pentico&s;t, or el&s;e that he could not have it in going in to men un|circumci&s;ed.</P>
<P N="3">3. You go on to endeavour to prove infant-bapti&s;m from Abraham's covenant. But here let me ob&s;erve, that the prie&s;thood in that church was as expre&s;ly limited to Aaron's natural &s;eed, as ever church-privileges were to Abraham's po&s;terity; yea and more &s;o, for one admitted of pro&s;elytes, the other did not: And it is abundantly evident from the New-te&s;tament, that both Abraham and Aaron were types of Chri&s;t, and their &s;eed types of the &s;aints; and I am fully per&s;uaded that there is every whit as much warrant from &s;cripture, to entail the mini&s;try under the go&s;pel to mini&s;ters natural &s;eed, as there is to give &s;pecial ordinances to the offspring of believers before they are converted. How vain is it then to attempt to build a New-te&s;tament ordi|nance upon an old-te&s;tament ceremony? How in|con&s;i&s;tent al&s;o is the method that is taken concerning 1 Cor. 7.14? For it is held on your &s;ide that this text proves that the ceremonial law is aboli&s;hed, by which the <HI>Jews wives, and &s;uch as were born of them, were put away,</HI> Ezra 10.3. And you take
<PB N="41" REF="011556_0039_0F8721AE99763FE0">
the &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>&s;anctified</HI> from the go&s;pel as we do, 1 Tim. 4.3,&mdash;5. Yet you turn directly back to that aboli&s;hed law for your &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>holy.</HI> We are commanded to make <HI>&s;trait</HI> paths for our feet; and if we regard it, we ought to know that the &s;ame law which called I&s;rael <HI>a holy people unto the Lord, above all people upon the face of the earth,</HI> commanded them for that rea&s;on not to <HI>make mar|riages</HI> with other nations, Deut. 7.3, 6. What <HI>crooked</HI> work then do they make who will take that law to explain the word holy by, in this very text which proves it to be out of date! Pray con&s;ider it; if our children are holy as I&s;rael were, then marriages with others is unlawful; but if &s;uch mar|riages are lawful now, then our children are not holy in that &s;en&s;e as they were.</P>
<P N="4">4. As to the mode of bapti&s;m, I ob&s;erve that you allow our mode to be good, but would have other modes to be good al&s;o; to which I would &s;ay, We have not only plain accounts of their going into and coming out of the water, but are twice &s;aid to be <HI>buri|ed</HI> by or in bapti&s;m, and all know that to be buried is to be covered. I know many &s;ay, this don't refer to literal, but to &s;piritual bapti&s;m; yet when the &s;ame per&s;ons come to the meaning of the word baptize, they would refer us to &s;piritual bapti&s;m, which they &s;ay is by &s;prinkling or pouring; but you know what is &s;aid of them that turn a&s;ide to <HI>crooked ways.</HI></P>
<P>We are &s;en&s;ible that the word <HI>&s;prinkled</HI> is often u&s;ed, but it is never applied to bapti&s;m in all the bible; and you ob&s;erve that tho&s;e who &s;peak not according to the law and te&s;timony, <Q>it is becau&s;e there is no light in them.</Q> You need then to &s;ee what you are doing when you call that bapti&s;m which the Bible never calls &s;o. We don't hold to re-bap|tizing
<PB N="42" REF="011556_0040_0F8721AF5510AB70">
any more than you do, but when we are con|vinced that what was formerly done under that name was not what the &s;cripture calls bapti&s;m, we e&s;teem it our duty to leave it though it were done by our deare&s;t fathers, and to practi&s;e Chri&s;t's com|mand; and your own words are full in our ju&s;ti|fication herein; for you &s;ay that Luke 14.26. <Q>Can mean nothing &s;hort of a di&s;regard of them in com|pari&s;on of Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel, and a hearty readine&s;s to oppo&s;e them, and bear te&s;timony a|gain&s;t them, wherein they for&s;ake the truth, and their duty.</Q>&mdash;I come,</P>
<P N="3">3dly. To con&s;ider your notion of liberty of con|&s;cience, where you tell Mrs. Lord, that you can hardly think what &s;he refers to, when &s;he &s;peaks of your <HI>tying the con&s;cience in &s;piritual things;</HI> and you &s;ay, <Q>Liberty of con&s;cience we claim our&s;elves, and allow others as a darling point.</Q> Yet you have laid her hu&s;band under church-cen&s;ure, for not coming to your communion, although it appears by your records, that he gave rea&s;ons for his not com|ing, both as to your principles and conduct, which he "could not approve of:" And when &s;he tells you &s;he is of the &s;ame way of thinking, you reply, that it was not for <HI>any opinion at all</HI> that he was dealt with in a way of di&s;cipline; and &s;ay, <Q>His being &s;u&s;pended does not therefore at all relate to you, or &s;hut you out.</Q></P>
<P>But in the fear of God, Sirs, what do you mean! Has the admitting per&s;ons of <HI>various characters</HI> to bring their children to bapti&s;m, and into a half-way covenant, no reference to any opinion? And if a per&s;on &s;ays, he &s;ees <Q>A &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition again&s;t the &s;pirit of God in the church in keeping out &s;ome preachers, and depriving the members of hearing, &amp; improving their gifts;</Q> and therefore
<PB N="43" REF="011556_0041_0F8721B01F934080">
declares he cannot commune with them for the&s;e rea&s;ons, and yet is cen&s;ured by the church therefor; is that <Q>allowing liberty of con&s;cience to others as a darling point!</Q> Or when another declares they are burdened with the &s;ame things, can it con&s;i&s;t either with liberty, or with <HI>truth,</HI> for the church to declare that the others ca&s;e don't <HI>relate</HI> to them <HI>at all,</HI> unle&s;s they are affected with it meerly on ac|count of natural <HI>relation;</HI> and &s;o go on with a va|riety of injurious &s;ugge&s;tions and repre&s;entations, which are followed with warnings and reproofs, without ever giving the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction as to the points their con&s;ciences were burdened with! If this be your church-order; if this be your liberty of con&s;cience, I mu&s;t &s;ay as Jacob did, <HI>O my &s;oul, come thou not into their &s;ecret, unto their a&s;&s;embly mine honor be not thou united.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t add, that your repre&s;enting that our em|bracing believers bapti&s;m, carries in it a <Q>renouncing all that a per&s;on has done to lay him&s;elf under obligations, all his profe&s;&s;ions, and all that God has done for him heretofore:</Q> And your often accu&s;ing us with repre&s;enting all others to be in a &s;tate of <HI>heatheni&s;m,</HI> are notorious fal&s;hoods. Who will pretend to &s;ay, that I&s;rael's being circumci&s;ed at Gilgal, implied a renunciation of their former obli|gations, or of any thing that God had done for them in the wilderne&s;s, or any pretence that they were then in a &s;tate of heatheni&s;m!</P>
<P>Methinks upon a review you mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;hock'd at your &s;aying, that the bapti&s;m which Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles received from John, <Q>was not the bap|ti&s;m of the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation.</Q> For we have not the lea&s;t intimation that Chri&s;t or any one of his apo&s;tles ever had any other water bapti&s;m but what
<PB N="44" REF="011556_0042_0F8721B0D5239F00">
they received by John, &s;o that you had as good &s;ay, that neither of them ever received the Chri&s;tian bap|ti&s;m!&mdash;I am willing to make all the allowance in the&s;e things, for remaining darkne&s;s and prejudice, that is con&s;i&s;tent with that <HI>charity</HI> which <HI>rejoiceth not in iniquity</HI> but <HI>in the truth;</HI> though I hope I may never give up the truth for any: And &s;ince you allow that a hating of fathers and brethren, in Luk. 14.26. can mean nothing &s;hort of <Q>a hearty readine&s;s to oppo&s;e them, and bear te&s;timony a|gain&s;t them, wherein they for&s;ake the truth and their duty;</Q> I hope you will not take it ill that I have taken the freedom to do &s;o to you.</P>

<P><HI>N.

And &s;ince your letter plainly holds forth that you have nothing again&s;t Mr. Lord, or his wife, but what relates to their religious &s;entiments and behaviour, I take that to be a recommendation of their moral character, and being &s;atisfied in their religion, I think our way is clear to receive them to our fellow&s;hip, without giving ju&s;t occa&s;ion of offence to any.</P>

<HEAD>Po&s;t&s;cript.</HEAD>
<P>DEAR Sirs, as I had but little opportunity when in your town, to an&s;wer your letter, I would now add a remark or two more. The fir&s;t is, That notwith&s;tanding your profe&s;&s;ed regard to the divine oracles, yet you &s;et up the practice of men above the example of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for, to &s;upport infant-&s;prinkling you &s;ay, <Q>The univer&s;ality of agreement in this practice among all &s;ectaries how different &s;oever, and oppo&s;ite to one another, except the few Bapti&s;ts &s;trongly argues in all rea&s;on that it is a practice of early date, and took its ri&s;e with the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation.</Q> Though by the way the change of the fea&s;t in the &s;eventh month, from keep|ing it in <HI>tabernacles</HI> to keeping it in their commodi|ous hou&s;es, was more univer&s;al; for I think we don't read of a &s;ingle di&s;&s;enter from that practice in a thou|&s;and years; unle&s;s the prophet is to be con&s;idered as one, who told this people, That the earth was <HI>defiled</HI> under them becau&s;e they had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the laws, <HI>changed the ordinance,</HI> I&s;a. 24.5. And if you look into John 7.44,&mdash;49 you may find that you are not the fir&s;t who have advanced the authority of great men and the multitude, again&s;t a de&s;pi&s;ed few; nor the fir&s;t that have &s;lighted the example of Je&s;us of Nazareth, as you do in &s;aying, <Q>As to the practice of John Bapti&s;t, allowing that he baptized by dip|ping only, <HI>that,</HI> we conceive, is nothing to the pre&s;ent mode of bapti&s;m; for his bapti&s;m was not the chri&s;tian bapti&s;m, for the chri&s;tian di&s;pen|&s;ation had not then taken place in the world:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If this arguing were good, then neither would it be any thing at all to us, how or in what manner Chri&s;t eat the Lord's &s;upper, for the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation was not then di&s;&s;olved. What do men run into when they turn a&s;ide from truth!</NOTE>&mdash;
<PB N="46" REF="011556_0044_0F8721B257026950">
Hence the boa&s;ted argument comes to nothing at all, which &s;ome u&s;e to prove the nece&s;&s;ity of be|ing baptized by <HI>dipping, That is a following the example of Chri&s;t.</HI></Q> Thus the example of our divine Lord (though it perfectly agrees with that of Philip and the Enuch, who went <HI>into,</HI> and came <HI>out of</HI> the water) &s;eems "nothing at all" in your eyes, while the practice of the multitude &s;ince the anti-chri&s;tian apo&s;tacy is &s;o &s;acred in your view, that you &s;ay, <Q>For a per&s;on that has been once baptized by &s;prinkling to renounce that bapti&s;m and be bap|tized by dipping, is at lea&s;t a triflng with the &s;acred ordinance, and but little, if any, &s;hort of a pro|fanation of it.</Q></P>
<P>Yea, &s;econdly, you, Sirs, who unju&s;tly judge Mrs. L. to hold water bapti&s;m as e&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation, notoriou&s;ly condemn your&s;elves therein; for you tell her, That whatever excu&s;es &s;he might be &s;o kind as charitably to make for you, <Q>yet alas! they won't help us; but your profe&s;&s;ed principles and practice in renouncing your infant-bapti&s;m [if our character and final &s;tate was to be determined ac|cording to them] would not only &s;hut us out of a church-&s;tate but out of heaven it&s;elf.</Q> And a|gain you &s;ay, <Q>If our bapti&s;m is null and void in the &s;ight of God,&mdash;there can be no hope of our &s;alvation in our way of admini&s;tration.</Q> If this is not a holding external forms to be e&s;&s;ential to &s;al|vation, I know not what can be &s;o; yea and &s;uch forms too as you are all forced to own, are built upon con&s;equences and not upon expre&s;s &s;cripture: And it is a tradition which, as far as it prevails, in|tirely cuts off your children from the liberty of <HI>an|&s;wering a good con&s;cience</HI> after they believe, by being baptized as their Lord was; yet you are the men
<PB N="47" REF="011556_0045_0F8721B418117408">
who accu&s;e us of <Q>making the commandment of God, the in&s;titution authori&s;ed by God, of none effect by our traditions,</Q> only becau&s;e we teach believers who were formerly &s;prinkled, that they ought now to be <HI>buried in bapti&s;m.</HI>&mdash;Upon the whole, I leave it to be con&s;idered whether the &s;tre&s;s of your long letter does not all turn very much upon this one point, viz That whatever mini&s;ters and churches have held &amp; practi&s;ed when they had God's Spirit with them, can never be for&s;aken under the &s;ame influence. Which argument, however &s;peci|ous it has appeared to many, carries nothing le&s;s in it than that old Quaker notion, That when a per|&s;on has the Spirit with him, he is then perfect; for if he is not &s;o, then there is no incon&s;i&s;tency in Peter's being taught by the &s;ame Spirit to go in to the uncircumci&s;ed at Ce&s;area, who fir&s;t taught him to preach to the circumci&s;ed at Jeru&s;alem; which was only a fulfilment of our Lord's words, who told them that he had many things to &s;ay to them which they could not bear now; but that the Spi|rit of truth &s;hould guide them into all truth; yet many di&s;cover &s;uch &s;trange ignorance of their bibles as to take this la&s;t clau&s;e to contradict the other with, as if the Spirit that guides into <HI>all truth,</HI> mu&s;t do it all at once, in&s;tead of guiding in that path which <HI>&s;hineth more and more until the perfect day!</HI></P>
<P>Churchmen have made much u&s;e of this very ar|gument for retaining all tho&s;e popi&s;h ceremonies which were not reformed by &s;uch eminent Saints and Martyrs as &s;uffered in Mary's days: And in|deed the nature of the argument is levelled again&s;t all further reformation, and verifies the ob&s;ervation of one of the mo&s;t eminent fathers of this country, namely Mr. John Davenport, the fir&s;t mini&s;ter of
<PB N="48" REF="011556_0046_0F8721B4E63B6250">
New-Haven, who afterward died at Bo&s;ton. He fir&s;t fled into Holland from per&s;ecution, and was de&s;ired to &s;ettle there, but a principal rea&s;on why he would not, was becau&s;e they (much as it is now in our country) admitted almo&s;t all &s;orts of per&s;ons to bring their children to bapti&s;m, therefore he de|termined to come here; for, <Q>He ob&s;erved, That when a <HI>reformation</HI> of the church has been brought about in any part of the world, it has rarely been <HI>afterwards</HI> carried on one &s;tep further, than the <HI>fir&s;t reformers</HI> did &s;ucceed in their <HI>fir&s;t endeavours;</HI> he ob&s;erved that as ea&s;ily might the <HI>Ark</HI> have been removed from the mountains of <HI>Ararat</HI> where it fir&s;t grounded, as a people get any ground in reformation, after and beyond the <HI>fir&s;t remove</HI> of the <HI>reformers.</HI> And this ob&s;ervation quickned him to embark in a de|&s;ign of <HI>reformation,</HI> wherein he might have oppor|tunity to drive things in the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, as near the precept and pattern of &s;cripture as they could be driven.</Q> See Dr. Mather's Magnalia, B. III. pag. 53. Accordingly, when in 1662, they, in&s;tead of per&s;uing further <HI>reformation,</HI> opened that way of <HI>degeneration,</HI> the half-way-covenant, he gave both his verbal and printed te&s;timony again&s;t it. I fully believe that many of the fathers of this country were truly built upon the Rock, but that infant-&s;prink|ling was among their wood, hay, &s;tubble, which will be burnt up; and I leave you to con&s;ider what a condition &s;uch are in, who have only their wood, hay and &s;tubble, to build upon.</P>
