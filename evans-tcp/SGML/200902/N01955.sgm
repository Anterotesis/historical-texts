<P>THE following <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> humble &amp; plain as it is, and on an Occa&s;ion &s;o rare &amp; &s;ingu|lar, needs no more to be &s;aid in <HI>Excu&s;e</HI> of it, than the&s;e <HI>two</HI> things: <HI>fir&s;t</HI> that it was prepar'd in obedience to the De&s;ire of the very Reverend Mr. <HI>Leverett,</HI> the pre&s;ent Learned Head and Pre&s;ident of the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> where it was deliver'd, in ca&s;e of the Ab&s;ence of the Aged and Venerable Dr. <HI>Increa&s;e Mather,</HI> who if his Years had permitted him would have pre&s;ided and &s;erved on &s;o great a <HI>Solemnity:</HI> And <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that the <HI>Author</HI> pretends to little more in this poor Performance than to give a &s;mall <HI>Collection</HI> of the Thoughts of a few Select Authors, that &s;tood by him on his Shelf, upon the <HI>In&s;tances</HI> which he has here cho&s;en; the <HI>Propriety</HI> whereof is &s;ubmitted to the Cen&s;ure of the Candid and Judicious <HI>Reader.</HI></P>

<P>For had ye believed Mo&s;es, ye would have believed Me; for he write of me.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OUR <HI>Lord Je&s;us</HI> is here di&s;cour&s;ing with the unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> affirming him&s;elf to be the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> whom they look|ed for and ought to believe in. At the 17. <HI>v.</HI> of the <HI>Chapter</HI> he told them that <HI>GOD was his Father,</HI> and that He was <HI>One</HI> with Him in <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> and <HI>Working.</HI> At this they took great <HI>Offence,</HI> becau&s;e he made him&s;elf <HI>equal</HI> with GOD. But our LORD ju&s;tified what he had &s;ail, and added many like glorious Words thereunto, re&s;pecting his own <HI>Eternal God-head</HI> and <HI>Divine Nature.</HI></P>
<P>HE told 'em, that <HI>as the Father hath life in Him|&s;elf, &s;o he hath given to the Son to have life in Him&s;elf:</HI> that a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> rai&s;eth up the Dead and quickneth the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in <HI>Sin</HI> or in

<P>AND then in Confirmation of all that he had &s;aid concerning Him&s;elf he produces <HI>three Witne&s;&s;es.</HI> 1. He appeals to the Te&s;timony of <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> who&s;e words concerning <HI>Christ</HI> &s;ome of them had heard, and they had born him (as he well de&s;erv'd) a high Reverence. This was He of whom <HI>Maiachi,</HI> the la&s;t of the Prophets of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> had &s;poken, &s;aying, <HI>Behold I &s;end my Me&s;&s;enger, and he &s;hall prepare the way before me, and the LORD whom ye &s;eek &s;hall &s;uddenly come into his Temple.</HI> 2. Our <HI>Lord</HI> appeals to the <HI>Works and Miracles</HI> which he had wro't, as a <HI>greater</HI> Te&s;timony than that of <HI>John.</HI> And la&s;tly, He refers 'em to the <HI>Scriptures of the Old Te&s;tament,</HI> and particularly to the Writings of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> 1. To tho&s;e Scriptures <HI>in general: v.</HI> 39. <HI>Search the Scriptures</HI> (and none other were then extant but the writings of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the <HI>Prophets) for in them ye have Eternal life, and the&s;e are they which testify of me.</HI> 2. To the Writings of <HI>Mo&s;es in particular: v.</HI> 45, 46, 47. <HI>Do not think that I will accu&s;e you to the Father,</HI> (i. e. I am not your only Accu&s;er) <HI>there is one that accu&s;eth you, even Mo&s;es in whom you trust: For had ye believed Mo&s;es, ye would have believed Me, for he wrote of me: But if ye believe not his writings, how &s;hall ye believe my words?</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews</HI> had and ever will have a great and ju&s;t Veneration for <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> They are his known and profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Di&s;ciples.</HI> He was under God the Law|giver to and founder of the Jewi&s;h Church. <HI>In him they tru&s;ted,</HI> as our Context &s;peaks; and they did well to tru&s;t and con&s;ide in his Veracity; for he was <HI>faithful in all his hou&s;e,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle to the <HI>He|brews</HI> &s;ays.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002324_0007_0FDB23B830DA0AE0">
HE was the <HI>first In&s;pired Writer</HI> and Pen man of Scripture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>Father</HI> of the Prophets and a <HI>Prince</HI> among 'em. <HI>Like him there aro&s;e not another in I&s;rael whom the Lord knew face to face.</HI> He &s;tands liken'd to CHRIST the <HI>Lord</HI> of the Prophets: <HI>A Prophet like unto thee &s;hall the LORD thy GOD rai&s;e up.</HI></P>
<P>THE highe&s;t &s;ort of <HI>Revelation</HI> was among the Jews called <HI>Gradus Mo&s;aicus</HI>
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See Arch-Bp. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI>'s Sermons, Vol. 5. p. 404.</NOTE> They conceive of it as an Immediate Divine Impre&s;&s;ion on the Under|&s;tanding, without fear, amazement or fainting. They think that He only among the Prophets pre&s;erv'd his ordinary temper under the highe&s;t Revelations of GOD to Him. Whereas <HI>Daniel</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> the fa|vourite <HI>Prophet</HI> and <HI>Apostle,</HI> fainted under their Vi&s;ions; yet were they Men <HI>highly beloved</HI> and of an <HI>excellent Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>TO this <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> now our LORD JESUS appeals in my <HI>Text:</HI> He &s;hall &s;peak and witne&s;s for <HI>Him</HI> to the <HI>Jews:</HI> He their own Prophet and <HI>Lawgiver</HI> &s;hall be their <HI>Judge:</HI> By <HI>his</HI> writings they &s;hall be Con|vinced or Condemned. He <HI>accu&s;es</HI> them for their Unbelief and Infidelity. Had the <HI>Jews</HI> but heeded and rightly under&s;tood what <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had wrote, they would have believed in and received our LORD JESUS. In rejecting <HI>Him</HI> they did in effect deny and reject <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THIS is our SAVIOUR's <HI>Argument</HI> in my Text, and it was <HI>ad Homines;</HI> the be&s;t that could be to have convinc'd <HI>the Jews,</HI> and I hope it appears to You much to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e on &s;uch a <HI>Ones Conver&s;ion</HI> to the Faith in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and Submi&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of JESUS. <HI>Had ye believed Mo&s;es ye would have believed Me, for he wrote of Me.</HI></P>
<P>HOW <HI>forcible</HI> are right words! this is open, &s;in|cere,
<PB N="4" REF="002324_0008_0FDB23BD90F2F188">bold and daring Argument. And this was the manner of our LORD and his Apo&s;tles always. See Luk. 24.27. <HI>And beginning at Mo&s;es and all the Prophets, he expounded thro' all the Scriptures the things concerning him&s;elf.</HI> And &s;o the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> converted the World, <HI>witne&s;&s;ing both to &s;mall and great and &s;aying none other things than tho&s;e which the Prophets and Mo&s;es did &s;ay &s;hould come.</HI> This way <HI>Paul</HI> took (in the wi&s;dom of GOD) to con|vince his <HI>Countrymen at Rome;</HI> Acts 28.23. <HI>He ex|pounded and te&s;tified the Kingdom of GOD, per|&s;wading them concerning Je&s;us, both out of the Law of Mo&s;es, and out of the Prophets, from morning till evening.</HI> A mo&s;t delightful Argument, and which would hold one much <HI>longer</HI> and not tire him. I may &s;ay of it, as the <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> in the pre&s;ence of their <HI>transfigured</HI> LORD did, while <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> talked with Him, &mdash; <HI>It is good to be here</HI></P>
<P>BUT I have only a few <HI>minutes</HI> allow'd me to &s;how you from <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> that JESUS is the Chri&s;t. I can only give you a &s;hort <HI>Specimen</HI> out of his writ|ings. We believe the writings of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> therefore we believe in CHRIST. I can only lay before you a few <HI>&s;elect Instances</HI> out of the <HI>fir&s;t Book</HI> of Mo&s;es, called <HI>Gene&s;is.</HI> As, 1. the Promi&s;e of <HI>the &s;eed of the Woman</HI> to break the Serpents head. 2. <HI>Abel</HI>'s acceptable Sacrifice. 3. The promi&s;es and Covenant of GOD given to <HI>Abraham.</HI> And 4. The Ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>Judah.</HI> &mdash; In many other <HI>In&s;tances, Mo&s;es</HI> wrote of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> but the&s;e are &s;ome of the mo&s;t <HI>E|minent</HI> which ly <HI>first</HI> in the Order of his <HI>Writings.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. PASSING over what the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> &s;ays concerning <HI>Adam</HI> that he was <HI>the figure of Him that was to come;</HI> I in&s;i&s;t upon the <HI>first and very famous Promi&s;e of a SAVIOUR</HI> unto mi&s;erable Man upon his <HI>fall;</HI> Namely, that HE &s;hould be the <HI>Seed of the Woman</HI> and &s;hould <HI>brui&s;e the Serpents
<PB N="5" REF="002324_0009_0FDB23BEE1C5C080">head,</HI> which &s;hould <HI>brui&s;e his heel.</HI> Gen. 3.15. <HI>This</HI> is &s;o fully an&s;wer'd and explained in the Account we have of the <HI>Conception, birth</HI> and <HI>death</HI> of our LORD JESUS, that nothing can be more plain and familiar. He was born of a <HI>Virgin, made of a Wo|man,</HI> by <HI>the power of the Highest:</HI> A <HI>Virgin did conceive and bare a Son,</HI> and <HI>the Holy thing born of Her was the Son of GOD.</HI> See and compare <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 7.14. with <HI>Matth.</HI> 1.23. <HI>Luke.</HI> 1.35. and <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.4. Chri&s;t's <HI>heel</HI> was His <HI>Humane Nature</HI> wherein He trod upon our Earth: This was <HI>brui&s;ed</HI> in His <HI>Cru|cifixion</HI> and Death: But at the &s;ame time the <HI>Serpents head was broken</HI> hereby, the Kingdom and works of the devil de&s;troyed by it.</P>
<P><HI>Maimenides,</HI> the great <HI>Jewi&s;h Doctor</HI> and Inter|preter, ju&s;tly admir'd this pa&s;&s;age, (as Bp. <HI>Patrick</HI> quotes him) <Q>That the <HI>Seed of the Woman</HI> &s;hould be only mentioned an not of <HI>Adam. This</HI> (&s;aid he) is one of the pa&s;&s;ages in Scripture which is mo&s;t wonderful, and not to be under&s;tood according to the Letter, but contains great wi&s;dom in it.</Q></P>
<P>VERY true, <HI>Great is this My&s;tery of Godline&s;s, God manifested in the fir&s;h,</HI> to de&s;troy the Works of the devil. The <HI>Son of GOD</HI> too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our Nature of the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin Mary;</HI> the <HI>Old Serpent,</HI> which is the <HI>devil and &s;atan,</HI> did all that he could to de&s;troy Him by <HI>Temptations</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ecutions;</HI> in the <HI>first</HI> way be prevailed nothing, the <HI>Evil one came and found nothing in Him;</HI> in the <HI>la&s;t</HI> way he reach'd his <HI>heel.</HI> His Holy and Fle&s;h, which was <HI>brui&s;ed</HI> indeed in His Crucifixion; but by that very means the devil him&s;elf was conquer'd and van<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and Mankind redeemed; and &s;o the Serpents head was <HI>broken.</HI> Heb. 2.14. <HI>Thro' death He de&s;troyed him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.</HI></P>
<P>SO that CHRIST our <HI>Saviour,</HI> as revealed to us by the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> in the manner of His <HI>Incarnation</HI> and in the End and glorious fruit of His <HI>Death,</HI> was
<PB N="6" REF="002324_0010_0FDB23C361523660">more ob&s;curely revealed to <HI>Adam</HI> as &s;oon as he had fallen. The <HI>Sum of the My&s;tery</HI> of CHRIST is un|deniably contained and delivered in this Prediction; <HI>It &s;hall brui&s;e thy head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heel.</HI></P>
<P>CHRIST's <HI>heel</HI> was literally brui&s;ed, <HI>when His feet were pierced and nailed to the Cro&s;s,</HI> but then the Serpents <HI>head</HI> was broken becau&s;e CHRIST did on the Cro&s;s <HI>&s;poil Principalities and Powers, tri|umphing over them,</HI> Col. 2.15.

<P>MAN had by Sin forfeited his life, his <HI>Soul,</HI> into the hand of GOD's avenging Ju&s;tice.

<P>ACCORDINGLY we may be &s;ure that <HI>Adam</HI> practis'd him&s;elf, and al&s;o in&s;tructed his Children in the Mode of wor&s;hipping GOD by Sacrifice, and in the meaning thereof. Whence it was that <HI>Abel offer'd his excellent Sacrifice:</HI> He exercis'd Faith in the <HI>great Sacrifice of his SAVIOUR,</HI> which was to take away Sin; he look'd to the Great Sacrifice of Attonement in the &s;en&s;e of Mans Sin and Apo&s;tacy from GOD: He humbled him&s;elf before his Judge, deprecated Divine Wrath, and implored Forgivene&s;s, by Faith in the promi&s;ed <HI>Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>CERTAINLY <HI>Abel's faith,</HI> celebrated by the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> had this re&s;pect to GOD's In&s;titution, and to the Promi&s;e of a <HI>Redeemer,</HI> who in the typical Reference of the&s;e fir&s;t Sacrifices was <HI>the Lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the World,</HI> Rev. 13.8.

<P N="3">III. IN the Covenant and Promi&s;es of GOD given unto <HI>Abraham.</HI> On this I &s;hall enlarge a little. "<HI>Abraham</HI> was a <HI>typical Head</HI> of GOD's Church and Covenant People: CHRIST is the <HI>true Head.</HI> To <HI>Abraham and to his Seed were the Promi&s;es made,</HI> &s;o are the Promi&s;es of the Eternal Inheritance to <HI>the Elect in Christ.</HI> In <HI>Abraham</HI> were the <HI>two Di&s;pen&s;ations</HI> of the Covenant of Grace &s;hadowed out, the <HI>Legal</HI> and the <HI>Evangelical.</HI> See Gal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 22, 25. Moreover, <HI>Abrahams</HI> illu&s;trious <HI>Submi&s;&s;ions</HI> to the Will of GOD, and the Glorious In&s;tances of his entire and ab&s;olute Obedience thereunto, may be e&s;teemed very bright Figures of the <HI>perfect Obedience</HI> of our LORD JESUS, both Active and Pa&s;&s;ive. His
<PB N="9" REF="002324_0013_0FDB23C7D91979E0">offering up his <HI>I&s;aac</HI> at GOD's Call is a kind of fi|gure of the FATHER's <HI>not &s;paring his Only be|gotten Son, but delivering Him up for us all.</HI> And his prevailing <HI>Interce&s;&s;ions</HI> for others, is no ob|&s;cure Shadow of the <HI>Efficacious Mediation</HI> of CHRIST. To be particular,</P>
<P N="1">1. VERY famous is the <HI>Promi&s;e and Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> given to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>three times</HI> over repeated to him, Gen. 12.3. <HI>In thee &s;hall all the Families of the Earth be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> 18.18. <HI>All the Nations of the Earth &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in him.</HI> 22.18. <HI>And in thy Seed &s;hall all the Nations of the earth he ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> Verily there is &s;ome mighty <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> contained in the&s;e Words; of Univer&s;al and Everla&s;ting extent, not only to the Natural &s;eed and Po&s;terity of <HI>Abra|ham,</HI> but to all People and Languages under Heaven; to be obtained for them and derived to them by this <HI>Promi&s;ed SEED.</HI> The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> to the <HI>Galatians</HI> gives us the true Interpretation and only Fulfilment of this Promi&s;e. Gal. 3.7, 8, 9, 14, 16. <HI>The Scrip|ture fore&s;eeing that GOD would justify the Hea|then through faith, preached before the Go&s;pel unto Abraham,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>In thee &s;hall all Nations be ble&s;|&s;ed. So then they which be of Faith are ble&s;&s;ed with faithful Abraham. &mdash; To Abraham and his &s;eed were the Promi&s;es made. He &s;aith not, and to Seeds, as of many; but as of One, And to thy SEED, which is CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>THE Sum and Sub&s;tance of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> was thus preached to <HI>Abraham</HI> in a very few words. CHRIST is the <HI>Grand Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> to the World: All the <HI>Fami|lies</HI> of the Earth that are ble&s;&s;ed by GOD are ble&s;&s;ed <HI>in Him;</HI> All that believe in Him are ble&s;&s;ed of whatever Families of the Earth they be; The <HI>Me&s;&s;i|ah</HI> was to come from <HI>Abraham</HI>'s joins as CHRIST did, the common <HI>Saviour</HI> and highe&s;t <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of lo&s;t Sinners. Act. 3.25. <HI>Unto you GOD having rai&s;ed up his Son JESUS, hath &s;ent him to

<P>BUT let us read the Word <HI>Schebet Rod;</HI> and the Que&s;tion is, What <HI>kind of red</HI> is here meant? The <HI>Jews</HI> perver&s;ly &s;ay, in &s;pite of the &s;cope of the whole Ble&s;&s;ing here given, It is the <HI>Rod of Correction:</HI> which they are indeed under in the utmo&s;t <HI>Empha&s;is</HI> of the Word. But this <HI>Interpretation</HI> does the utmo&s;t Violence to the <HI>Context,</HI> which &s;peaks altogether of <HI>Judahs</HI> Preheminence, Honour, Superiority, plenty felicity; Maje&s;ty, Victory and Empire. This there|fore ought to determine the &s;en&s;e for us, that it is the <HI>Red of Dignity and Government</HI> that is here meant, which is to &s;ay a <HI>Scepter;</HI> the <HI>&s;trong Red of them that hear rule.</HI> Ezek. 10.11.</P>
<P>THE LXX therefore read it <GAP DESC="foreign">, the <HI>Ruler;</HI> of who&s;e Authority and Dignity the Rod, Staff and Scepter is the En&s;ign. Amos 1.5. <HI>Him that hold|eth the Scepter:</HI> i. e. the King or Chief Ruler. Very ju&s;tly therefore do we tran&s;late it <HI>Scepter,</HI> and the Prophecy was that <HI>Judah &s;hould hold it.</HI></P>
<P>THE other Word <HI>Mech<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kek,</HI> which we tran&s;late <HI>Lawgiver,</HI> &s;ignifies, (as Bp <HI>Patrick</HI> ob&s;erves both from the Scripture and Jewi&s;h u&s;e of the word) a Power and Government <HI>inferiour to the Royal Dignity;</HI> Governours <HI>dependent</HI> on and <HI>deriving</HI> from Ano|ther that is Supream; &s;uch as after the Captivity were &s;et over the <HI>Jews</HI> by the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and afterward by the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the days of <HI>David</HI> to the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> Cap|tivity <HI>Judah</HI> had properly the <HI>Scepter</HI> or Royal Power: And after their return from <HI>Babylon</HI> to the days of our <HI>Saviour</HI> and a few years after, they had a Government and <HI>Governours</HI> among them; and ge|nerally before our Saviours time the <HI>Governour
<PB N="18" REF="002324_0022_0FDB23DDA28EB9B8">in Chief</HI> was of them&s;elves; and the <HI>Government was mostly Jewi&s;h,</HI> the Great Council or <HI>Sanedrim</HI> having great power and Authority unque&s;tionably lodged in them. At the Birth of CHRIST the <HI>Romans</HI> had the Sovereignty over 'em, and the poor Remains of Power and Dignity were <HI>departing</HI> apace from <HI>Judah.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ba&s;nage</HI> thinks we have been too much cazled with the word <HI>Scepter,</HI> as if it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily imply a proper <HI>Regal Authority.</HI> This (he thinks) has run Chri&s;tian <HI>Exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;itors</HI> into inextricable Lybyrinths; in as much as there were no Kings of <HI>Judah</HI> from <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to <HI>David;</HI> &s;o neither any from the Captivity in <HI>Ba|bylon</HI> to the la&s;t de&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> So that the prope <HI>Scepter</HI> or <HI>Regal</HI> Authority began 600 Years after the <HI>Oracle</HI> of <HI>Jacob,</HI> continued but about 500 Years, and ended 500 before Chri&s;t; and &s;o in no wife &s;eems to an&s;wer the <HI>Prophecy.</HI></P>
<P>BY <HI>Scepter</HI> therefore he would have us to under&s;tand only <HI>a High Degree of Preheminence,</HI> which was the portion of <HI>Judah</HI> when it did not hold the Regal Scepter. <HI>Judah</HI> excell'd the other <HI>Tribes</HI> in Numbers and in Valour. When the Government was <HI>Ari&s;to|cratical</HI> Judah had the fir&s;t port, and march'd at the head of the Tribes. When it was <HI>Monarchial,</HI> the Kings were chiefly of this Tribe, yea in a con&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion they were &s;o from the time of <HI>David.</HI> And wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Council or <HI>Sanedrim</HI> govern'd, <HI>Judah</HI> was the Tribe in Being, and <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> the Seat of the Govern|ment. Thus in all re&s;pects it had the Preheminence.</P>
<P>BUT now the la&s;t De&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> has confounded this Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> and &s;catter'd them thro' the Earth. It has only this Shadow of Prehe|minence left, that in its di&s;per&s;ion it is pre&s;erved a di&s;tinct Body among the Nations, here a Per&s;on and there a Family or two, but uncertain for the mo&s;t part whether they belong to <HI>Levi,</HI> to <HI>Benjamin</HI> or to <HI>Judah.</HI> The <HI>Scepter</HI> &s;ub&s;i&s;ts no where, nor has it been any where for more than <HI>Sixteen whole Cen|turies</HI>

<HEAD>THE <HI>PREFACE</HI> TO THE <HI>READER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Conver&s;ion of <HI>Mr. Monis</HI> to Chri&s;tianity, is an Effect of Di|vine Grace. The Truth and Re|ality of his Conver&s;ion appears in what is here Exhibited, in that he has notably confuted the <HI>Jews,</HI> from the <HI>Scrip|tures in the Old-Te&s;tament,</HI> which they pre|tend to believe. Here is al&s;o a&s;&s;erted and proved, <HI>the Deity of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI>
<PB N="ii" REF="002324_0035_0FDB23F8326784C8">And that although he is a Man, yet more than a Man. And here al&s;o is a&s;&s;erted and proved the Glorious My&s;tery of the <HI>Trini|ty,</HI> that that GOD who&s;e Name is <HI>Jeh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vab</HI> is the <HI>Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</HI> The&s;e are the main Principles whereby <HI>Christianity</HI> is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from <HI>Judai&s;m</HI> &amp; other fal&s;e religions. There will a time come when there &s;hall be a General Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation.</HI> There have been &s;ome of that Nation brought home to Chri&s;t, who have proved Ble&s;&s;ings to the World. In &s;pecial <HI>Emanue! Tremelius</HI> was &s;uch an one, who&s;e dying Words were, <HI>Vivat Chri&s;tus, et pereat Barra|bas.</HI> Let Chri&s;t Live, and let Barrabas Die. There were Two <HI>Jews, viz. John Alexan|der</HI> and <HI>Theodore John</HI> who joyned them|&s;elves to the German Lutheran Congrega|tion in the City of <HI>London.</HI> A Learned Man, <HI>viz.

<P>IT is moreover True, that many particu|lar <HI>Jews,</HI> who have been Converted or rather Perverted to Popery, have after Re|noun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their Chri&s;tianity.

<P>MANY other Examples I might mention but I forbear. There is no cau&s;e to fear that <HI>Mr. Monis</HI> will Renounce his Chri&s;ti|anity, &s;ince he did embrace it Voluntarily and Gradually, and with much Con&s;idera|tion,

<P><HI>I</HI> Do expect the News of my Embracing the Chri&s;tian Religion that came to your Ears &s;ome time ago, has been &s;omewhat &s;urprizing to you all; and I am afraid you did not think it to be the be&s;t you ever have heard; If &s;o I am very &s;orry for it, and hope in the God of Love and Mercy, that He will keep me in my belief, with that Love towards you in particular, and to all Mankind in general, and more e&s;pecially to tho&s;e that belong to the hou&s;hold of Faith, as his holy Word has di|rected me: and have mercy upon you, and in due time take the Vail from before the eyes of your Under&s;tanding, that &s;o you may &s;ee the veracity of his Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>ONE thing I would intreat of you, (which in ca&s;e you will be willing to grant unto me, I am in great hopes you love your Souls, and hear that brotherly affection and love towards

<P><HI>Dear Brethren,</HI> I can't but think &s;ome of you are very much troubled at my proceedings, but this I would de&s;ire and heartily be&s;eech of you, to know and be fully per&s;waded, that the Christian Religion (the Prote&s;tant I mean) is not &s;uch a one as you take it to be, but it is the best of all Religions, and <HI>&s;o far as I know</HI> the cleare&s;t from Super&s;titions of any what&s;o|ever.</P>
<P>THE Doctrine of the ever ble&s;&s;ed Trinity (that you very much &s;tumble at) is not an er|roneous one (as you thro' a mi&s;take do appre|hend) but a true and certain one, that God has been plea&s;ed to reveal in his Word, i. e. <HI>in the Old Te&s;tament</HI> from the very begin|ning, (<HI>vide, the third Di&s;cour&s;e</HI>) altho', not with that clearne&s;s as <HI>He</HI> did afterwards in the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> which I most &s;urely and
<PB N="iv" REF="002324_0041_0FDB240883492BD8">certainly believe to be the Word of God, as well as the Old; becau&s;e I cannot &s;ee any &s;ubstantial rea&s;on that can be alledged to in|validate the Authority of the <HI>New,</HI> but the &s;ame may be brought to de&s;prove the veracity of the <HI>Old;</HI> and &s;o to the contrary the &s;ame Rea&s;ons that any <HI>Rabby</HI> what&s;oever may bring to prove the Truth of <HI>Mo&s;es's</HI> Mira|cles, and the rest of his Words, the very &s;ame may be with equal strength improved to evidence the certainty of Chri&s;t's Wonderful Works and Mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>INDEED if I had declared my &s;elf, to be one of the Church of <HI>Rome's</HI> Communion, I &s;hould not Wonder, in ca&s;e I was cen&s;ured by the lea&s;t of you, becau&s;e that would be nothing el&s;e but practically to deny the Law and the Prophets, &amp;c. But &s;ince I have not (God forbid that I or any of you &s;hould,) and my embracing the Prote&s;tant Religion, I did it not ra&s;hly, but upon mature thoughts and deliberation (as you may &s;ee by the following Di&s;cour&s;es, and more of this Nature that I do de&s;ign to acquaint you with, if God by His mo&s;t holy will and plea&s;ure, &s;hall open the way for it.)

<Q><BIBL>PSALM CXVI. 10.</BIBL>
<P>I Believed, therefore have I &s;poken: I was greatly Afflicted.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS Nothing can be e&s;tabli&s;hed without a Foundation, &s;o likewi&s;e according to the firmne&s;s and &s;olidity of &s;aid Founda|tion, the Super&s;tructure will la&s;t or decay.

This Maxim is ancient and infallible, and &s;o common that nothing can be more obvious to the beholders. We have heard or &s;een &s;everal in&s;tances of this Nature, not only in Worldly Affairs, but even in Spiritual al&s;o. We read in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, <HI>Chap.</HI> 5.39. how the Great <HI>Doctor Gamaliel</HI> u&s;ed this very Ar|gument, for the Deliverance of <HI>Peter</HI> and the re&s;t of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> from the hands of their Per&s;ecutors, &s;aying, <HI>If it be of God ye cannot overthrow it,</HI> i. e. if the Doctrine which the&s;e Men teach is founded upon Mens Foundation (as that of <HI>Teudas,</HI> and of <HI>Judas the Galilean</HI> were,) it &s;hall certainly peri&s;h; but in ca&s;e their Doctrine, is founded upon a &s;ure and good Foun|dation,

<P>To which I an&s;wer,</P>
<P>TO under&s;tand what the Prophet &s;ays, according to the Interpretation which their Modern <HI>Rabbins</HI> have newly Invented, (who apply &s;o many different Scrip|tures to maintain their Chimaerical notions, as I could make it appear if I had a mind to expo&s;e them) I think it is nothing but a Folly, and I am &s;ure if the Spirit of Truth had not left them, they could very quickly &s;ee with what kind of Food they have been

<P>TO prove the Truth of my Explication with Chri&s;|tian Authors, or with the 20th Chapter of the <HI>Revela|tions,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002324_0051_0FDB241B1DF42EB0">I know it is in vain (as to them) therefore I only de&s;ire of them to Read the Book called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|mauh David</HI> compo&s;ed by that famous <HI>R.

<P>I cannot but admire the <HI>Jewi&s;h Nations</HI> Notion to believe, this War &s;hould be in the fir&s;t advent of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah;</HI> &s;ince one of the principal Arguments which they alledge again&s;t the certainty of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> being come, is that general Peace that &s;hould be in his days, and for ever more after, as we &s;hall under&s;tand anon. And yet they argue again&s;t us becau&s;e there was he War; how could it be a War (and of &s;uch quality and quantity as this is de&s;cribed by the Prophet in the&s;e two Chapters) and yet be Peace? Or how could it be a general Peace in his days, and for evermore after, and a War in the &s;ame time? The&s;e two things Peace and War, are &s;o contrary one to another, that can never be reconelled in the World as the <HI>Jewi&s;h

<P>FOR the Confirmation of my A&s;&s;ertion, I will quote one &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age more out of their own <HI>Rab|bins,</HI> and then conclude with this Argument, viz.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Bere&s;hith Rabbau,</HI> a Book of Great Authority among them, treating upon the 11th. ver&s;e of the 40th Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> which &s;ays, <HI>And Pharaoh's Cup was in my Hand;</HI> after a large and adilated Di&s;|cour&s;e, the Author ponders upon the word which our Engli&s;h Tran&s;lators tran&s;lated, <HI>Salvation,</HI> in the 13th. ver&s;e of the 116th P&s;alm, which in the Origi|nal is in the Plutal Number <HI>He&s;hoognoth, Salvations,</HI> and &s;ays <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, <Q><HI>Cup of Salvations: Cup of Sal|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> (in the &s;ingular) <HI>is not wrote in this place, But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Saloations</HI> (in the Plural to teach us there &s;hall be two Salvations) <HI>one in the Time (or days) of the Me&s;&s;iah, and another in the time (or days) of Gog.</HI></Q></P>
<P>NOW out of the&s;e Sentences I gather Two things; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that the time of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and the time of <HI>Gog</HI> are two different Times, and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that Chri&s;t was to be a <HI>God</HI> as well as <HI>Man,</HI> contrary to what they are willing now to own, becau&s;e they &s;ay, <HI>that be &s;hall kill the wicked with the Speech of his Lips,</HI> and I ask, who is that that could or can kill another Man like him&s;elf with a &s;ingle Breath only? Did ever any Man do &s;uch a thing? Or can any Man kill the lea&s;t vi&s;ible Creature by the Breath of his Mouth only, much more a Man?

<P N="2">2dly, THE Second Argument they bring to prove the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is not yet come, is becau&s;e, (they &s;ay) <HI>When Christ &s;hall come, be &s;hall gather the ten Tribes in company of all the re&s;t of the Jewi&s;h Nation, that are &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">attered all over the World, and bring them all together into one place even in the Holy Land.</HI> This Opinion they ground upon what is written in <HI>Deu.</HI> 30. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 5. in <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 11.11, 12. and in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 39.25, &mdash; 29. <HI>If any of thine be driven out unto the utmo&s;t parts of heaven, from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from thence will be fetch thee. And the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and thou &s;halt po&s;&s;e&s;s it: and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s in that day, that the Lord &s;hall &s;et his hand again the &s;econd time, to recover the remnant of his people which &s;hall be left from A&s;&s;y|ria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cu&s;h, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the i&s;lands of the &s;ea.

<P>To this I an&s;wer,</P>

<P>IF I was of the Opinion of &s;everal Divines, and even of &s;undry <HI>Jewi&s;h Rabbins</HI> I could make it appear that all tho&s;e places they quote to uphold their Opinion, and &s;everal more &s;cattered up and down in the Old Te&s;tament, are already fulfill'd in their Deliverance from the <HI>Babylonian Captivity;</HI> and likewi&s;e that the Ten Tribes, which <HI>Shalmanezer</HI> King of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> carry'd Captive to <HI>Halah</HI> and <HI>Haber</HI> by the River <HI>Gozan,</HI> and in the Cities of the Medes, as we read in 2 Kin. 17.6. &amp; 18, 11; are either totally lo&s;t, or at lea&s;t they are &s;o mixed and mingled with tho&s;e Nations where they were carried, that their return in a di&s;tinct Body as they were before their Captivity, is next to impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002324_0055_0FDB2426DC744188">
BUT &s;ince I cannot &s;ee &s;o clearly into the Expo&s;ition of the &s;aid Prophecies as they do, I beg leave to di&s;&s;ent from them in this point; Becau&s;e at that time, i. e. at their return from <HI>Babel,</HI> neither the <HI>Ten Tribes</HI> nor the whole <HI>Two</HI> did return to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and at that time they were not &s;cattered all over the World, and therefore they could not be gathered from whence they were not; and the words &s;eems plainly to declare they &s;hould be &s;cattered, becau&s;e in I&s;ai. 11.11, 12. it is &s;aid, that the <HI>Di&s;per&s;ed of Judah &s;hall be ga|thered from the four Corners (or Wings) of the Earth.</HI> Therefore I am prone to think this Prophecy does &s;peak of the &s;tate and condition, the <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation</HI> are now under, &s;cattered up and down the whole World, and that God doth here promi&s;e to gather them as they were before.</P>
<P>BUT this one Thing I would put the <HI>Jewi&s;h Na|tion</HI> in mind of, i. e. that altho', I grant their return, and plead for them, again&s;t tho&s;e that under&s;tand it otherwi&s;e; yet let them know, and be fully per&s;waded, that this return will never come to pa&s;s, till they ac|knowledge the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> for their <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> and <HI>Goell,</HI> i. e. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and <HI>Redeemer.</HI></P>

We read thus, <HI>I will no more have mercy upon the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, but I will utterly take them away.</HI> So likewi&s;e in Amos 5.1, 2. <HI>Hear ye this word which I take up again&s;t you, even a la|mentation O hou&s;e of I&s;rael: The Virgin of I&s;rael is fallen, &s;he &s;hall no more ri&s;e; &s;he is for&s;aken upon her land, there is none to ri&s;e her up.</HI> In I&s;ai. 6.10. <HI>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, &amp; &s;hut their eyes, le&s;t they &s;ee withtheir eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and convert and be healed.</HI> And &s;everal more.</P>
<P>AND if we look in other places (as tho&s;e cited by the <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation</HI>) we &s;hall read in them every thing contrary to other Prophets Predictions.</P>
<P>NOW to &s;ay any otherwi&s;e, than that both &s;peak true, is the &s;ame as denying the Canon of the Bible, and to own both, &s;eems too gro&s;s a folly for any &s;en|&s;ible Per&s;on? What mu&s;t we then do? Deny all we dare
<PB N="14" REF="002324_0057_0FDB242A16065DE0">not: Own all we cannot: What then? We mu&s;t have a recour&s;e, as I &s;aid before, to other places in the Bible, where we &s;hall find Light enough to enlighten us to under&s;tand &s;uch Scriptures.</P>
<P>THE Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> &s;peaking upon the &s;ame Subject in another place, foretells the Salvation of his People, with the Addition of a Shepherd, even <HI>David his Servant,</HI> which God will &s;et up to &s;eed and rule over them as a Prince, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 34.22, 23, 24.</P>
<P>THE Prophet <HI>Ho&s;ea</HI> treating upon this very &s;ame point in the 3d Chap. ver. 5th. &s;ays the&s;e notable words, <HI>Afterwards &s;hall the children of I&s;rael re|turn and &s;eek the Lord their God, and David their King, and &s;hall fear the Lord and his Goodne&s;s in the latter days.</HI></P>
<P>THE Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> is more wonderful in de&s;|cribing the condition of the &s;aid deliverance, Chap. 3d. 8, 9. which runs thus, <HI>For it &s;hall come to pa&s;s in that day &s;ays the Lord of Ho&s;ts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But they &s;hall &s;erve (or wor&s;hip) the Lord their God, and David their King, whom I will rai&s;e up unto them.</HI></P>
<P>HERE in the&s;e places we find a full an&s;wer, and an intire reconciliation to the afore&s;aid places. i. e. their return doth depend upon this <HI>Condition,</HI> that they &s;hall &s;eek the Lord their God, and <HI>David their King,</HI> as in <HI>Ho&s;ea;</HI> and that they &s;hall &s;erve (or wor&s;hip) the Lord their God, and <HI>David their King,</HI> as in <HI>Jere|miah;</HI> and to prevent any mi&s;-interpretation of the words, <HI>David their King,</HI> for <HI>King David,</HI> (as the <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation</HI> do,) the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> u&s;es the word <HI>AUKIM, I will rai&s;e</HI> in the future Ten&s;e, to &s;ignify the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> which was to ri&s;e from the Dead, and this <HI>King David</HI> indeed was to be their King, and him they mu&s;t &s;eek and &s;erve in the &s;ame way and manner as they &s;eek and &s;erve their God, even the Lord <HI>Jehovah,</HI> mentioned together, be|cau&s;e both are of one &s;elf &s;ame Sub&s;tance, equal in

<P>THE <HI>Targum,</HI> upon the 5th. ver&s;e of the 3d.

<P>NOW I hope they will be convinced, that their return and being gathered as they were before, depends altogether upon &s;eeking and obeying the Lord their God, and the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> who is already come, and who is their <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Redeemer,</HI> el&s;e in vain do they expect to be delivered, &s;aved, and brought over again to the former Glory.</P>
<P>Thirdly, THE Third Argument they bring to prove the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is yet to come, is becau&s;e (they &s;ay) <HI>a Third Temple is to be built at His Coming;</HI> and this they prove out of what is written in the la&s;t Chapter of <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> and more particularly of the 12th, and 13th. Ver&s;es of the 6th. Chap. of <HI>Zachariah,</HI> which runs thus, <HI>And &s;peak unto them &s;aying, thus &s;peaketh the Lord of Ho&s;ts, &s;aying, Behold the Man who&s;e Name is the Brench and be &s;hall grew up out of his place, and he &s;hall build the Temple of the Lord, even he &s;hall build the Temple of the Lord, and he &s;hall bear the Glory, and &s;hall &s;et and rule upon his Throne, and the Coun&s;el of Peace &s;hall be between them both.</HI> And now they argue thus, Since a Third Temple is not built, which is the true mark, and in&s;allible Sign, <HI>ergo,</HI> the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is yet to come.</P>

<P>This is the true Word of God, and as &s;uch can ne|ver be altered; and although an Attempt has been made by <HI>Julian the Apo&s;tate</HI> to build it a third time, on purpo&s;e to oppo&s;e God's Word, as the Hi&s;tories gives us an account, neverthele&s;s it never came to pa&s;s, and never will to the Worlds end.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, BY their own Ancient Authors; I do not remember they ever le&s;t any thing recorded, where|in they &s;hew this opinion i. e. that a third Temple was to be built as the Modern <HI>Jews</HI> do Believe of late (who I am very much afraid they are &s;omewhat couched with the &s;ame &s;pirit that their Countrymen were in <HI>Jeremiah's</HI> time, becau&s;e they have a parcel of Teachers newly &s;tarted up, &s;o &s;elf-conceited and &s;o proud with their Religion, that they have le&s;t the good old Interpretation that their good Hone&s;t Rab|bins of Primitive Ages u&s;ed to give to the Holy

<P>BUT that they may be fully &s;atisfy'd in this point, &s;o as not to live with &s;uch fal&s;e hopes, I will quote one pa&s;&s;age more of one of their bigge&s;t Expo&s;itors, whom they call for his great under&s;tanding the true meaning of the Scriptures <HI>Dzna Hautoran, the Ears of the Law,</HI> (becau&s;e as they &s;ay, by his mean|ing

<P>NOW &s;ince they have &s;o great Veneration for this <HI>Rabby,</HI> and he &s;ays that this Building is to be under|&s;tood of the Second Temple, let them be &s;ilent, and be convinced, I be&s;eech them, that the Third Temple is never to be Built, (whatever their new up-&s;tart <HI>Rabbins</HI> do teach, feeing it is proved with as many Authorities as any Judicious Per&s;on can de&s;ire to have for the Satisfaction of any doubt what&s;oever,) and con|clude, that the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is already come; and with this belief, and obeying what He hath commanded, I hope they will be gathered from all parts where-ever they are, even &s;ince the Captivity of the Ten Tribes, into their Country, in a National Body as they were in for|mer Ages, and be Settled, and Build Churches, as many and as pompous, as their hearts &s;hall wi&s;h; and &s;erve and wor&s;hip the True and the Living God through Chri&s;t; and be e&s;tabli&s;hed for ever.</P>
<P>Fourthly, THE Fourth Argument which they bring to prove their Opinion, is, <HI>That every thing,</HI> i. e. <HI>every Creature &s;hall be as it was before Adam's fall, without being hurtful, but innocent, and live in peace
<PB N="20" REF="002324_0063_0FDB24391DB506B8">one with another.</HI> &mdash; This they prove with what I&s;ai. 11.6, 7, 8, 9. &s;ays, which runs thus. <HI>The wolf &s;hall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard &s;hall lie down with the Kid, and the Calf and the young Lion, and the fatling together, and a little child &s;hall lead them: And the Cow and the Bear &s;hall feed, their young ones &s;hall lie together, and the Lyon &s;hall eat straw like the Ox: and the &s;ucking Child &s;hall play on the hole of the A&s;p, and the weaned Child &s;hall put his band on the Adders Den: they &s;hall not burt nor de&s;troy in all my holy Mountain,</HI> &amp;c. And they argue thus, Since the&s;e things &s;hould come to pa&s;s, at the time of Chri&s;t's coming, and we never &s;aw nor heard, that ever the Creatures act &s;o, but they are as fierce as ever they were; <HI>ergo,</HI> The <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is not come.</P>
<P>TO this I an&s;wer, that altho' &s;ome of their new up&s;tart <HI>Rabbins</HI> for to uphold their Opinion or Belief, do maintain that this Prophecy is to be under&s;tood li|terally, I beg of them not to be &s;o ea&s;ily drawn a&s;ide from the Opinion of their Old Teachers, and then I am fully &s;atisfy'd they will quickly embrace the true <HI>Me&s;&s;iah.</HI></P>

But the Prophecy is to be under&s;tood in an Allegorial &s;en&s;e, and the be&s;t Al|legory that can be found, Conformable to the Orthodox opinion, is, That tho&s;e Men and Nations which before the coming of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> were proud and fierce as Lyons and Wolves, and the re&s;t of the Rave|nous Creatures mentioned in the Text, at <HI>his</HI> coming &s;hall all grow as meek and pliable as <HI>Lambs,</HI> and <HI>Kids</HI> are, by &s;ubduing their Wills to the Obedience of Chri&s;t's Laws, and they &s;hall feed together, i. e. of the Word and Sacraments, all alike without any difference be|tween them, even from the King to the Pea&s;ant, they &s;hall all be ruled, by the &s;ame Laws and Directions that Chri&s;t &s;hall pre&s;cribe, and they &s;hall Live peace|able and quiet one with another, not hurting one a|nother, either in E&s;tate or Name. This has been punctually fulfilled at Chri&s;t's coming (and ever &s;ince by all the True and Sincere Chri&s;tians) in the Con|ver&s;ion of &s;o many cruel and &s;avage fort of Men, they rendring Obedience to Chri&s;t's Laws, became as tame and tractable as any what&s;oever, becau&s;e the Laws of Chri&s;t teach nothing but Humility, and Ex|claim again&s;t Pride and Arrogancy, as is well known to all his followers. And</P>
<P>NOW &s;o long as they can't prove that this Pro|phecy and others of this nature are to be under&s;tood F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ally by any Authority more Ancient and Au|thentick then <HI>Maimonides,</HI> nor give a better Inter|pretation

<P N="5">5thly, THE fifth Argument they alledge to e&s;ta|bli&s;h their Opinion is, <HI>that when the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hall come and for ever more after his coming till the Worlds end, there &s;hall be a general and univer&s;al Peace all over the World.</HI> This they prove out of I&s;ai. 2.4. which runs thus, <HI>And they &s;hall beat their Swords into Plow&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning|books; Nation &s;hall not lift up Sword against Nation, neither &s;hall they learn War any more.</HI> And they argue thus, Since a General and Everla&s;ting Peace is promi&s;ed by the Prophet in this Place, to be in the Time of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> the contrary of which we daily &s;ee, (that not only the Wars are not cea&s;ed &s;ince Chri&s;t's Coming, but on the contrary, they have increa&s;ed daily, not only with the ordinary way of fighting, that was in u&s;e in tho&s;e days; but even with a new Invention of Fire Arms, never heard before a few hun|dred Years ago,) therefore (they &s;ay) if all the Ar|guments could be an&s;wered, this is unan&s;werable, becau&s;e the words are plain, i. e. <HI>Nation &s;hall not lift up &s;word again&s;t Nation, neither &s;hall they learn War any more. Ergo,</HI> The <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is not come at yet.</P>
<P>TO this I An&s;wer,</P>
<P>I know &s;ome to avoid this Argument, would have the Prophet &s;peak here, of that inward Peace of Con&s;cience, that every Good Chri&s;tian enjoys that follows the Laws of Chri&s;t; which Peace is an Ever|la&s;ting Peace. Some under&s;tand this place for that Eternal Peace, that &s;hall be in the Church after the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> &s;hall be brought together, under
<PB N="23" REF="002324_0066_0FDB243FD5DF0790">one Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of Souls; and that then (and not before) this Prophecy &s;hall be fulfill'd. Some would have this Prophecy to be already fulfill'd in that General and Univer&s;al Peace that was thro' the whole World in <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> Time, as we read in Luk. 2.1. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s in tho&s;e days, that there went out a decree from Ce&s;ar Augu&s;tus, that all the world &s;hould be taxed.</HI> This la&s;t Opinion I am apt to think is what the Prophet meant in this place. But the <HI>Jewi&s;h Rabbins</HI> are very &s;tiff in denying of it, al|ledging the words, <HI>Neither &s;hall they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> War any more.</HI> And tho' this &s;eems the &s;tronge&s;t Argument they have again&s;t Chri&s;t's Coming, and &s;eems to have the be&s;t face and colour to uphold their Opinion, I de&s;ign in a few Minutes time to &s;how the Rottenne&s;s of it, hoping if they will &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider it, they will all come and look on Him, whom (with their in|ward Jarrs and Contentions) they have pierced.</P>
<P>I &s;ay then, That God by His Prophet, never in|tended, that after the coming of Chri&s;t, a perpetual Peace &s;hall be in the World, becau&s;e if he had &s;o in|tended, we &s;hould all live in Peace and Tranquility, &s;ince <HI>He</HI> is come, and being the contrary we daily &s;ee and feel, <HI>ergo,</HI> we may certainly conclude, that he never meant &s;o.</P>
<P>BUT the true and genuine meaning of this Prophecy is, God declares that at Chri&s;t's coming &s;o long as He was upon Earth bodily, and no longer, the World &s;hould enjoy Peace. And this for Two Rea&s;ons, Fir&s;t, To &s;how that He was the King of Kings, and therefore &s;o long as he was upon Earth, none &s;hould be &s;o daring, as to take up Arms one again&s;t ano|ther, &s;eeing their Lord and King was upon Earth.

<P>NOW they argue thus, Since we &s;ee that your Chri&s;t is come above 1700 Years ago, and the Moun|tain of the Lord's Hou&s;e, never grew &s;o as to be higher than it was before is coming; Neither do all the Nations in General without exception, acknowledge him to be the <HI>true Me&s;&s;iah.

<P>BY the Scriptures, in the fulfillment of the Time that the Prophet <HI>Daniel</HI> pre&s;cribed; viz. the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was to come, at the time that the Seventy Prophetical Weeks was ended. And if we could be certain when the&s;e Seventy Weeks begun, it could be demon&s;trated and plainly made to appear, that Chri&s;t came ju&s;t ex|actly at the time appointed.</P>
<P>BY their own Authors I find in the <HI>Talmud Ba&s;e|theth Sanedrin, Chap. Heleck,</HI> a famous De&s;cription when the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was to come, which de&s;erves to be ingraven and kept for a Monument to all Ages. The words are as following, <Q><HI>It was read in the Hou&s;e

<P>UPON this la&s;t quotation the <HI>Jewi&s;h Rabbins,</HI> argue thus, Altho' &s;aid Sentence is &s;o as I &s;ay, yet there are the&s;e words at the end of it, <Q><HI>And for our great Sins there have pa&s;&s;ed from them all tho&s;e that have pa&s;&s;ed.</HI></Q> Which words imply, (they &s;ay) that altho' the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was to come at the beginning of the 5th thou&s;and, this was to be under&s;tood in ca&s;e we were good, but not if we were great Sinners.</P>
<P>TO this I an&s;wer.</P>
<P>THAT the&s;e la&s;t Words which they pretend belong to the Sentence are <HI>forged</HI> and <HI>&s;purious,</HI> and <HI>were added</HI> to the Sentence, after they &s;aw that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was manife&s;tly pointed forth by this Prediction, and becau&s;e <HI>be</HI> came at the time appointed by it, and they would not own him; with their con|rupt affections towards Chri&s;tianity, made the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the&s;e words to it, to cover with &s;ome colour the &s;tiffne&s;s of their Necks.

<P>Fir&s;t, BECAUSE if we examine the Sentence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the beginning to the end, where they will have it fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h'd, we &s;hall find it is comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s'd of two Language, the fir&s;t from the beginning 'till where I ended is no|thing but <HI>Jeru&s;alemitical</HI> Tongue, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> part, i. e. that addition which they would have belong to it, is nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pure Hebrew phra&s;e, (&s;uch as <HI>Mojes</HI> him&s;elf could hardly make better;) wherefore I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> but think that they are forged words as I &s;aid, be|cau&s;e in all the <HI>Jer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tane Talmud</HI> I do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

But upon Su&s;pi|cion only; I &s;ay</P>
<P>Secondly, THAT the&s;e words were Spurious &amp; Forged. Becau&s;e if we examine the time &amp; place, when this Sen|tence was &s;aid, we &s;hall find, that I do not wrong them, in charging them with fal&s;ifying of it. N. B.</P>
<P>THIS Prediction was &s;aid at the Hou&s;e or School of <HI>Elijab,</HI> who was a <HI>Rabby</HI> of that Name, that flouri&s;h'd according to the calculation of times, made by their own Authors, as we find in the Book called <HI>Sever Guolaum</HI> above 400 Years before Chri&s;t's com|ing, a little after the Building of the Second Temple, and in the City of <HI>Babel.</HI> Now how could the &s;aid Sentence or Prediction be delivered with the&s;e words, <HI>and for our Sins,</HI> &amp;c. at the end of it, &s;o long as the time was not yet come? (much le&s;s pa&s;s) and therefore we may certainly conclude, the&s;e words were added to the Sentence, altho' we can't produce the fir&s;t Original.</P>
<P>NOW to avoid &s;uch cen&s;ures and reflections as com|monly are made by Per&s;ons upon tho&s;e that di&s;&s;ent from them, I will quote one Pa&s;&s;age more very re|markable, wherein any body may plainly di&s;cover, that according to the Traditions receaved among the <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation,</HI> a great many Hundred Years before Chri&s;t's coming, the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was to come at the time He did, and not before or after.

<P>AND it &s;hall come to pa&s;s in the La&s;t days, i. e. <HI>in the days of the Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> that the Mountain of the Lord's Hou&s;e, i. e. <HI>the Church of the Lord which is founded and establi&s;hed upon a Stone or a Rock, that was Cut out without hands and became a great mountain.</HI> Shall be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Top of the Mountains and &s;hall be exalted above the Hills, i. e. <HI>Flouri&s;h and increa&s;e, overcoming all oppo&s;itions a|gain&s;t her.</HI> And all Nations &s;hall flow unto it, i. e. <HI>Some Nations, or &s;ome of each Nation, a Remnant of each &s;hall come and &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the Laws and Ordinances of Chri&s;t their Redeemer.</HI></P>
<P>THE 9th, and La&s;t Argument they bring to prove the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is yet to come, is, <HI>That Chri&s;t at his coming &s;hall not abrogate any thing of the Law of Mo&s;es, but the &s;aid Law (not only the Moral, but even the Ceremonial) &s;hall be kept to the World's end. And &s;ince we &s;ee that by the coming of your Chri&s;t not only all the Ceremonial part is aboli&s;hed, but even &s;ome of the Moral al&s;o (as the keeping of the Sabbath) ergo</HI> He <HI>is not the true Me&s;&s;iah pro|mi&s;ed by the Prophets.</HI> This fond opinion they ground upon the 20th, 21&s;t Ver&s;es of the 59th Chap. of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> which runs thus, <HI>And the Redeemer &s;hall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion in Jacob &s;ays the Lord. As for me this is my Covenant with them &s;ays the Lord, my Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, &s;hall not depart out of thy mouth, not out of the mouth of thy &s;eed, nor cut of the mouth of thy &s;eeds &s;eed, &s;ays the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</HI></P>
<P>TO this I an&s;wer,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, IF we under&s;tand this Prophecy Literally, it
<PB N="34" REF="002324_0077_0FDB24571EDE8EB0">&s;peaks nothing concerning the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> but only of the Redeemer that was to deliver them from the Cap|tivity of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and <HI>Cyrus King of Per&s;ia,</HI> is que&s;|tionle&s;s, the Redeemer here intended, as we read, <HI>Ezr.</HI> 1.1.</P>
<P>BUT 2dly, If we under&s;tand this Place Typically, I am prompt to think it makes more for our &s;ide than for theirs: and the Covenant here mentioned, is the ve|ry &s;ame that the Prophet (<HI>Jer.</HI> 21.31, 32, 33.) &s;peaks of. And this new Covenant that the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was to e&s;tabli&s;h at his coming, is that which the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;ays in this Place, &s;hall not depart from the Church, which is that very &s;eed &s;poken of, in Chap. 53.10. <HI>He</HI> (Chri&s;t) <HI>&s;hall &s;ee his &s;eed, he &s;hall proloug his days, and the plea&s;ure of the Lord &s;hall pro&s;per in his hand.</HI> And &s;ince this was to be a <HI>Law,</HI> and a <HI>Covenant</HI> (which Words are in the Old Te&s;tament Synonymous Terms, as we Read, that the very Decalogue which is called a Law, in <HI>Deut.</HI> 4.44. is called a Covenant in <HI>Exod.</HI> 34.28.) made with Chri&s;t's People according to his Holy Will and Plea&s;ure, the expre&s;&s;ions are with the Affixy of the 2 P. M. S. i. e. <HI>My Spirit that is upon thee,</HI> that is upon Chri&s;t, and it is as much as if it had been plainly &s;aid, that the Word and Spirit &s;hould ne|ver depart from him, nor from his holy Seed after Him, but &s;hould continue for ever till the end of the World, and that the Old Covenant made with them in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s time &s;hould be aboli&s;hed, as the Apo&s;tle to the Heb. 8.13. ob&s;erves, when he &s;ays,&mdash;<HI>And in that he &s;aith a New Covenant, be hath made the fir&s;t old, now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vani&s;h away.</HI> This is the True and Genuine meaning of the&s;e Prophe&s;ies, and not (as they fal&s;ly &s;uppo&s;e) i. e. that the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> &s;hould not abrogate the Law of <HI>Mo|&s;es.</HI> This is not our opinion only, but even their own Authors and Expo&s;itors under&s;tood it &s;o al&s;o. And becau&s;e I am not willing to be too Proli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, as I could it I had a mind to explain, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 42.7. &amp; 49.9. and I know that a quotation of one of their <HI>Rabbins</HI> (to
<PB N="35" REF="002324_0078_0FDB2458A4888618">the mo&s;t part of them,) is of more Authority than the written Word, I will alledge one, of &s;undry that I could, and then conclude.</P>
<P>IN that Ancient and famous Book of theirs called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> upon the la&s;t Word of the 11. Chap. of Eccl. are the following words, <Q><HI>Vanity, the Law which a man learns in this World</HI> (i. e. before the coming of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah) is vanity, in compari&s;on of the Me&s;&s;iah's Law.</HI></Q> This &s;entence plainly &s;hows Two very remarkable things, 1&s;t, That there &s;hould be Two Laws, one before Chri&s;t's coming; and another after. And 2dly, That the Law before <HI>His</HI> coming is nothing but a meer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hadow and vanity in compari&s;on of the Law, that was to be in the Church of God after <HI>his</HI> coming; and this is the very &s;ame thing that the great Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith to the Col. 2.16, 17. <HI>Let no man therefore judge you, in meals or in drink, or in re&s;pect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the &s;abbath days, which are a SHADOW of things to come, but the body is of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>AS for the other part of the Argument, in which they &s;uppo&s;e that &s;ince Chri&s;t's coming the 4th Com|mandment is aboli&s;hed, I &s;han't meddle with it at this time, becau&s;e (be&s;ides that it has been an&s;wered by &s;undry Learned Divines at large before now) it would take me a great deal of time, in handling of it, with all the Branches belonging thereunto.</P>
<P>THEREFORE &s;ince I have an&s;wered in full and as &s;hort as I could, the principal Arguments that I can remember the <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation</HI> do bring to In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">date the Veracity of our Chri&s;tian Religion. Let us draw to a Conclu&s;ion &s;aying with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>I believed therefore have I &s;poken, I was greatly aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted.</HI> It is the Opinion of the be&s;t Expo&s;itors, that King <HI>David</HI> in compo&s;ing this <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> aimed not only a Solemn Thank&s;giving to God for his Great and Glorious deli|verance from grievous and dangerous Calamities that he had been under, but al&s;o from great Perplexities
<PB N="36" REF="002324_0079_0FDB245A601A4EB8">and Terrors of Mind, ari&s;ing upon him from the deep &s;en&s;e of God's di&s;plea&s;ure towards Unbelievers. Now it &s;eems to me that this Godly King having with &s;e|rious Con&s;ideration pondered the great and manifold Goodne&s;s of God towards Sinners from the beginning, in finding out a way to deliver them from the Wrath which was to come, i. e. in &s;ending in the fulne&s;s of time, His Only Dear and Beloved Son into this World, out of his own Loyns, according to the Fle&s;h, not on|ly to &s;uffer, but even to dye for their Sins and Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, on purpo&s;e to reconcile the World of Man|kind to God, I &s;ay after the Meditaion of God's Love, and likewi&s;e the poor and mi&s;erable Condition of Un|believers in General, and of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation</HI> in par|ticular, he broke forth with the&s;e notable Words, <HI>I believed therefore have I &s;poken, I was greatly Afflic|ted.</HI> If &s;o let us Believe and be fully per&s;waded that <HI>Je&s;us Christ</HI> of <HI>Nazereth</HI> is the only Son of the Living God, and the True and only <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> Prophe&s;ied of by the Prophets from the beginning, who came in the fulne&s;s of time, according to the Promi&s;es for the Salvation of all tho&s;e Sinners that Believe in him, that he <HI>Dyed</HI> and <HI>Suffered</HI> for our Sins, and <HI>Ro&s;e</HI> for our Ju&s;tification, and is &s;et down at the Right hand of <HI>God the Father,</HI> making Interce&s;&s;ion for us, from whence he &s;hall come to Judge the Quick and the Dead. If you with Sincerity Believe this, <HI>which I do Solemnly Declare and Profe&s;s</HI> (before God, His Holy Angels, and all this Congregation) <HI>to be my only Belief i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which I Hope to be Saved;</HI> Then we have a &s;ure foundation, and an Everla&s;ting Ba&s;is that can never be moved, and Living according to this Belief, i. e. O|beying <HI>Christ</HI>'s Laws and Ordinances, <HI>which I Pur|po&s;ely do de&s;ign with GOD's Help to follow from Fenceforth,</HI> we may be &s;ure to obtain <HI>thro' God's Free Grace</HI> the Everla&s;ting Life in the World which is to come, World without End.</P>

<P>CONCERNING the Jewi&s;h Nation's Conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as to the Rea&s;on why they are not converted, in &s;o long and dilated a Time of above 1700 Years, &s;ince Chri&s;ts Appearance into the World, I find our Divines do differ; and Eight &s;everal Rea&s;ons are by them aliedged: Namely,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Some are apt to think the idolatrous Wor&s;hip of the <HI>Romi&s;o</HI> Church is the Cau&s;e of it, becau&s;e (they &s;ay) ever &s;ince the Jewi&s;h Nation have paid &s;mart enough for the Sin of Idolatry, which they were addicted to before the De&s;tructi|on of the fir&s;t Temple, &s;uffering &s;o many Troubles, Afflictions and Calamities, as both &s;acred and pro|fane Hi&s;tories have left us an Account of, they took &s;uch an Aver&s;ion to &s;aid Sin, and &s;o abhorred tho&s;e that commit it, that nothing can be compa|red to it: Aud therefore, when the Romi&s;h Mi&s;&s;io|naries, and &s;undry other Sorts of Prie&s;ts and Fry|ars of the Romi&s;h Communion, do engage with any
<PB N="2" REF="002324_0082_0FDB11D5098B40A8">of the Jewi&s;h Nation, in any publick or private Di&s;putation, about the coming of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and what Sort and Manner of Wor&s;hip the Church is to follow in ca&s;e <HI>He</HI> is already come, for the mo&s;t part, the Popi&s;h Doctors do come off with the wor&s;t; and in ca&s;e the <HI>Rabbits</HI> are &s;ophi&s;tically bit, neverthele&s;s <HI>they</HI> won't yield to them, becau&s;e they teach what is contrary and oppo&s;ite to the Second Commandment; &s;aying (and with a very good Rea|&s;on) that the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> which is promis'd by the Prophets, is not to come for to abrogate any Laws of the Decalogue, and particularly &s;uch as are con|trary to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Divine Maje&s;ty, and therefore they re|main unconverted.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> SOME are of Opinion, the Rea&s;on of their being &s;o long unc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">verted, is to be attributed to the Lives and Convertation of &s;ome of the Pro|te&s;tant Religion, who live not according to the Rules of Morality; whence, without further Exa|mination, the Jews conclude the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> come.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> SOME do think the Rea&s;on that hinders their Conver&s;ion, is their Stubborne&s;s and Stiffneck|edne&s;s, becau&s;e they are not willing to give Ear to what is recorded, minding nothing but their own Intere&s;t and Plea&s;ure, and therefore God (as it were) has left them, and they can never be con|verted; and they bring &s;undry Examples out of the &s;acred Oracles for to prove their A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, SOME do conceive the Rea&s;on of <HI>their</HI> not being converted in &s;o dilated a Time, is more to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e attributed to the Manner and Way in which <HI>they</HI> have been t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rated by &s;undry Princes of Chri&s;ten|dom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with Fire and Sword, as in the King|doms of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> contrary to all the Laws of Nature; they knowing, that Religion is not to be forced, if it be a true one, and that only the fal&s;e does u&s;e &s;uch Means and take &s;uch Me|thods
<PB N="3" REF="002324_0083_0FDB2463576712D8">for to be e&s;tabli&s;hed and propagated; and &s;o concluding, the Chri&s;tian Religion to be one of them, el&s;e the Chri&s;tians would not force <HI>them</HI> with &s;uch ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ui&s;ite Torments, to make them for|&s;ake their own and follow theirs.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI> SOME do imagine, the Differences that have been in the Prote&s;tant Church, have been the Cau&s;e of their remaining unconverted. Without further Examination, when they &s;ee &s;o many Jarrs and Debates among them, every one upholding their own Opinion to be the be&s;t and the true&s;t, and con|dem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing the others: <HI>They &s;ay,</HI> Let them fir&s;t agree among them&s;elves, and afterwards we will con&s;ider what to do. [This I know to be true by Experi|ence.]</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> SOME do &s;ay, the Rea&s;on of their not being converted, is to be attributed to the great Fondne&s;s they have to their <HI>Rabbies</HI> or Teachers, &s;ince they take it for granted <HI>they</HI> are infallible in their Doctrine: Whatever they teach in Publick or Private, by Preaching or by Conferring, they una|nimou&s;ly conclude all they &s;ay to be true, under a Suppo&s;ition, that they would not teach a thing which they really thought to be fal&s;e, and cau&s;e by their Doctrine the Ruin of others: And &s;o &s;ome charge the Want of their Conver&s;ion to their Teach|ers altogether.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly.</HI> SOME &s;ay the Rea&s;on of their not be|ing converted as yet, is, becau&s;e <HI>they</HI> cur&s;ed them|&s;elves and their Children after them in the Time of Chri&s;t's Crucifixion, as it is recorded in Matt. 27.25. <HI>Then an&s;wered all the People, and &s;aid, His blood be on us, and on our Children.</HI> And therefore, &s;ince they are under the Cur&s;e, they are of Nece&s;&s;ity &s;o blind with a &s;piritual Blindne&s;s, that they can't &s;ee the Light of the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, and have (as it were) before the Eyes of their Under&s;tanding, a Vail that hinders them from apprehending the
<PB N="4" REF="002324_0084_0FDB24649E1FC2F0">great and true My&s;teries, pre&s;cribed in the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly and la&s;tly,</HI> SOME are apt to think, the Rea&s;on of their Unbelief does proceed from their be|ing under the Yoke of the Law, and &s;o under a Cur&s;e, as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays to the Galatians, 3.10. <HI>For as many as are of the Works of the Law are un|der a Cur&s;e; for it is written, cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in</HI> all <HI>things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</HI> Therefore (they &s;ay) &s;o long as they are under a Cur&s;e for not being able to obey the whole Law, and won't come out of that Bondage, and embrace Chri&s;tianity, they are as (it were) left, and &s;o they remain unconverted.</P>
<P>THESE are the Eight chief Rea&s;ons (which I can remember) our Divines do give for their Unbelief: But with Submi&s;&s;ion, I am prone to think, another may be given; for altho' tho&s;e afore&s;aid &s;eem to carry &s;ome Weight in them, yet if we examine each di&s;tinctly, we &s;hall find &s;uch Flaws in them, which will &s;how the Uncertainty of them. Namely,</P>
<P>FOR the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Tho&s;e that live among Prote&s;tants might be convinced of the reality of Chri&s;tianity, be|cau&s;e they do not wor&s;hip Images, nor bow down to Stones and Stocks as the Papi&s;ts do, but do preach again&s;t &s;aid Manner of Wor&s;hip, and teach that it is contrary to the Word of God, as may be plainly &s;een in all their Writings.</P>
<P>FOR the <HI>Second,</HI> If the Lives and Conver&s;ation of &s;ome few Per&s;ons &s;houldly in the Way of their Conver&s;ion, the Lives and Conver&s;ation of a great many eminent and Orthodox Chri&s;tians of the Pro|te&s;tant Church of &s;undry Sorts and Ranks, who live up to their Profe&s;&s;ion, &s;o far as in them lies, and particularly among the Clergy, would take off the Force of their Objection.</P>
<P>FOR the <HI>Third,</HI> Tho&s;e who are not employ'd in worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s and Mammon, (as I know a great
<PB N="5" REF="002324_0085_0FDB2467E5910120">many are) and who do live a contemplative and &s;peculative Life, &s;hould not be hindred from being converted, &s;ince nothing &s;tands in their Way to fat|ten and harden their Hearts or to &s;top their Ears: And the&s;e we know are tho&s;e very ones which do uphold their Opinion with their vehement prea|ching and teaching the common &s;ort of People, contrary to the Truth.</P>
<P>FOR the <HI>Fourth,</HI> Tho&s;e that live under the Protection of &s;undry pious and religious Princes, ever &s;ince they can remember, protected by the Laws of the Country where they live, (as in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Dominions, and &s;undry others,) &s;hould be converted, and invite the re&s;t of their Brethren to come, live and do as they did, and be all in one Body, <HI>i. e.</HI> under one Protection, with Peace and Liberty of Body and Mind.</P>
<P>FOR the <HI>Fifth,</HI> Altho' the Prote&s;tants did and do differ among them&s;elves, and have had &s;undry Jarrs and Animo&s;ities concerning Religion, of which the learned World is &s;en&s;ible, neverthele&s;s, they all agree in the main Point, <HI>i. e.</HI> That Je&s;us Chri&s;t is already come for the Salvation of all tho&s;e Sinners that believe in him; and their Dif|ferences are nothing concerning any fundamental Point in reality, but indifferent ones.</P>
<P>FOR the <HI>Sixth,</HI> Altho' in general they are &s;o fond of their <HI>Rabbies,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Kiddar</HI> &s;uppo&s;eth, yet the learned among them do make a great Diffe|rence between tho&s;e Doctrines which they take to be <HI>oral,</HI> recorded in the <HI>Talmud, Bedra&s;him,</HI> &amp;c. and tho&s;e private Expo&s;it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, which a particular <HI>Rab|bi</HI> puts forth; as it may be te&s;tify'd by tho&s;e learn|ed Gentlemen that are acquainted with their Wri|tings.</P>
<P>FOR the <HI>Seventh,</HI> That Cur&s;e they took upon them&s;elves and their Children after them, recorded in <HI>Mat.</HI> 27.25. in the Time of Chri&s;t's Crucifixi|on,
<PB N="6" REF="002324_0086_0FDB246914CC7298">may be an&s;wered with what is recorded in Luk. 23.34. <HI>Then &s;aid Je&s;us, Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</HI></P>
<P>FOR the <HI>Eighth</HI> and la&s;t, It may be an&s;wered, the Word <HI>Koll</HI> that &s;ignifieth <HI>All,</HI> is not in the Original, as may be &s;een in <HI>Deut.</HI> 17.26.</P>
<P>THEREFORE I &s;ay, &s;ince we &s;ee &s;aid Rea&s;ons may be an&s;wered, and <HI>they</HI> remain in their <HI>Judai&s;</HI>&mdash;, another may be offered, which I think is unan&s;wer|able: Namely,</P>
<P>I TAKE all the Rea&s;ons already named, and a great many more that may be offered of that Na|ture to be nothing but the Effects of that principal Rea&s;on that is the Cau&s;e of it; which is (&s;o far as I am able to &s;earch) that which is recorded in the Epi&s;tle of <HI>Paul</HI> to the Romans, 11.25. <HI>Blindne&s;s in Part is happened to I&s;rael, until the Fulne&s;s of the Gentiles be come in.</HI> The Jewi&s;h Blindne&s;s, which is the Cau&s;e of their not being converted, the Apo&s;tle calls a <HI>Mystery,</HI> and con&s;idered as &s;uch, we mu&s;t not be very forward to gue&s;s at it, more than it has been revealed. The Apo&s;tle tells us, this will la&s;t <HI>till the Fulne&s;s of the Gentiles be come in. Then</HI> it &s;eems to intimate, <HI>they</HI> &s;hall come in as a Nation together with the Gentiles, under one Shepherd, and not before, as the Evangeli&s;t <HI>John</HI> 10.16. doth &s;ay, <HI>And other Sheep I have, which are not of this Fold; them al&s;o I mu&s;t bring, and they &s;hall hear my Voice; and there &s;hall be one Fold, and one Shepherd;</HI> meaning the Jewi&s;h Nation. And,</P>
<P>THESE Words <HI>In Part</HI> of the Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> make me think, it intimates the Blind|ne&s;s which &s;ome Part of the Nation have, <HI>i. e.</HI> their <HI>Rabbies</HI> or Teachers, which do keep to re&s;t of the Common People in the &s;ame Way with them, <HI>i. e.</HI> in <HI>Blindne&s;s,</HI> not able to &s;ee that the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is already come.</P>

NOW, &s;ince I have &s;hewn (&s;o far as I can &s;ee) which is the true Rea&s;on of their being unconvert|ed, let us inquire, which are the chief Points the&s;e two Churches, <HI>i. e.</HI> of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>true Chri&s;tians,</HI> do differ in.</P>
<P>IF we examine the Creed of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation, we &s;hall find the <HI>true Christians</HI> do agree with them in all Points of it, except one; Namely, We Chri&s;tians believe Chri&s;t is already come, and they (the Jews) that he is to come: And this is the chief and principal Point the&s;e two Churches do differ in; and it is as the Hinge whereon the whole Controver&s;y between them doth hang.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>they</HI> are to believe, according to their Principles, that the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is to come, is unque&s;ti|onable, &s;eeing it is the Twelfth Article of their <HI>Creed,</HI> according to <HI>Maimonides</HI> upon the <HI>Mi&s;h|na of Sanedrin Chap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elck:</HI> The Sub&s;tance of his Words are as follow, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>The Twelfth Ar|ticle is the Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> i. e. <HI>to wait and believe that he is to come,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>according as all the Prophets did prophe&s;ie, from</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>even to</HI> Malachi; <HI>and who&s;oever doubts it, or mistru&s;ts his Excellency, it is as much as if he denied the Law, and he hath no Share in the future World.</HI></Q> This Article <HI>they</HI> do believe, and wait for him to this very Day.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>we</HI> believe that <HI>He</HI> is already come, is que&s;tionle&s;s, becau&s;e who&s;oever among us &s;hould deny it, is no more a Chri&s;tian, as who&s;oever believes among the Jews that he is already come, is no more a Jew.</P>
<P>TO prove that he is already come, with going thro' all the Prophecies and plain Demon&s;trati|ons that can be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ought for it, and an&s;wering all the Objections that the Jewi&s;h Nation do argue upon each, would be almo&s;t an endle&s;s Piece, (more fit for a long T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e than for a &s;hort E&s;&s;ay,)

<P>THE Rea&s;on of my undertaking to di&s;cour&s;e upon this Prophecy more than any other, is, becau&s;e the mo&s;t part of the Chri&s;tian Doctrine is therein contained, and particularly the&s;e <HI>Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Points are therein expre&s;&s;ed.

<PB N="10" REF="002324_0090_0FDB24751D9837B8">
<ITEM>1. FOR the Similitude <HI>He</HI> had to a Child, be|ing &s;inle&s;s, as it is recorded in the Epi&s;tle to the Heb. 4.15. <HI>Yet without Sin;</HI> and in John 3.5. <HI>In him is no Sin.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. AS none can enter into the Kingdom of Hea|ven, but &s;uch as are &s;incere and Spotle&s;s like Chil|dren, with the Regeneration of the Spirit, as in Mark. 10.15. <HI>Verily I &s;ay unto you, who&s;oever &s;hall not receive the Kingdom of God as little Children, he &s;hall not enter therein,</HI> i. e. being &s;incere and &s;pot|le&s;s: So likewi&s;e we never heard of any Body could charge Je&s;us Chri&s;t (and make it good) with any unfair Dealings, either in his Life or Conver&s;ation, &s;o long as he was upon Earth; but he always carried <HI>Him&s;elf</HI> with all Uprightne&s;s and Sincerity imaginable, as <HI>His Holy Per&s;on</HI> did require, teaching the Commandments of God to all Per&s;ons what&s;oever, as we find it recorded in Mat. 19.17. <HI>But if thou will enter into Life, keep the Commandments.</HI> This &s;ort of Doctrine <HI>He</HI> u&s;ed to teach, and no other, wherein he &s;newed, he was &s;ent by God, as in John 3.2. <HI>We know that you are a Teacher come from God.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THE &s;econd Point is, <HI>what &s;ort of Per&s;on the &s;aid Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould be.</HI> This is declared in the following Words, namely, <HI>Unto us a Son is given.</HI></P>
<P>CHRIST is call'd by the Prophet (after he de|nominates him a <HI>Child,</HI> in Reference of his being <HI>&s;incere and &s;potle&s;s)</HI> a <HI>SON,</HI> having Reference to his being the Son of the living God, not as a <HI>Frimegentus,</HI> or Fir&s;t-born, that might &s;ignify that he begat another be&s;ides, but as an <HI>Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">geni|tus,</HI> or only begotten Son, from all Eternity, or before any Time what&s;oever.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> was called the Son of the Living God in the New-Te&s;tament, none but tho&s;e that never read it, nor have heard of him, are igno|rant:
<PB N="11" REF="002324_0091_0FDB247699867450">But that he is &s;o call'd in the Old Te&s;ta|ment, and in the be&s;t Jewi&s;h Authors or <HI>Rabbies</HI> of old, is my pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s to prove, <HI>i. e.</HI> before they had took &s;uch an Antipathy again&s;t all Sorts of Religion but their own.</P>
<P>PLAIN Text is that which is recorded in the &s;econd P&s;alm and la&s;t Ver&s;e, which &s;ays, <HI>Ki&s;s the Son,</HI> i. e. <HI>adore,</HI> or <HI>embrace the Son,</HI> becau&s;e he is not only a Man, but God al&s;o.</P>
<P>THAT this Ver&s;e &s;peaks concerning <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is clear &amp; manife&s;t by the Context: In the &s;econd Ver&s;e of &s;aid P&s;alm it is plainly expre&s;&s;ed, <HI>The Kings of the Earth &s;it them&s;elves, and the Rulers take Coun&s;el together again&s;t the Lord, and again&s;t his anointed.</HI></P>
<P>THE plain Te&s;timony of their Authors is to be found recorded in that famous and renowned Expo&s;itor among them, <HI>Then Ezra,</HI> who &s;ays up|on &s;aid Ver&s;e as follows, <Q><HI>Ki&s;s the Son, Behold, &s;erve the Lord (with Fear) is referrring to the Lord Jehovah; and ki&s;s the Son, refers to his Chri&s;t; and the Word Bar is to be under&s;tood as in</HI> Prov. 31.2. <HI>What my Son, and what the Son of my Womb; and &s;o is written in the the 7th</HI> Ver&s;e, <HI>Thou art my Son.</HI></Q> It is not <HI>He</HI> only that under|&s;tood it &s;o, but before him, tho&s;e that are in more Authority among them under&s;tood it &s;o al&s;o, as may be &s;een in that famous Book call'd, <HI>Medra&s;h Tehelim,</HI> upon &s;aid P&s;alm, which I omit for Bre|vity &s;ake.</P>
<P>THE bigge&s;t Difficulty the modern Jews do oppo&s;e again&s;t &s;aid Expo&s;ition, is this, They &s;ay, (when they talk with tho&s;e who under&s;tand lit|tle or nothing of the Hebrew Tongue) the Word that is tran&s;lated in our Engli&s;h Bibles <HI>Son,</HI> in the Original is not <HI>Ben</HI> but <HI>Bar,</HI> which Word &s;ignifieth not a <HI>Son,</HI> but &s;omething el&s;e; and they bring plain Examples for it, by which they do &s;ilence tho&s;e that know no better.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002324_0092_0FDB2479F474D540">
BUT &s;uch Shifts to oppo&s;e the Truth will not always do. To an&s;wer &s;aid Objection, 'tis re|qui&s;ite only to &s;end them to that famous Dictio|nary of the Hebrew Tongue, compos'd by that learned and famous Author <HI>Rabbi David Kinchi,</HI> (whom they all acknowledge to be a <HI>None-&s;uch,</HI>) call'd <HI>Shera&s;him,</HI> and there they will find this Word <HI>Bar</HI> &s;ignifieth the &s;ame with <HI>Ben, a Son.</HI></P>
<P>BUT &s;ince I am upon this Word <HI>Bar,</HI> I think it is proper to give my Thoughts upon it, be|cau&s;e by the true Intelligence of it, we &s;hall di&s;|cover &s;ome great My&s;teries of the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion, comprehended in this &s;ingle Mono&s;yllable, <HI>Bar.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Word <HI>Bar,</HI> &s;o far as I can learn, &s;igni|fieth Three Things: Namely,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A Son.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Pure, or clean: And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Corn, or Food.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>FOR the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As in <HI>Prov.</HI> 31.2. What my <HI>Son,</HI> and what the <HI>Son</HI> of my Womb.</P>
<P>FOR the <HI>Second,</HI> As in <HI>Job.</HI> 11.4. For thou ha&s;t &s;aid my Doctrine is <HI>pure,</HI> and I am <HI>clean</HI> in thine Eyes.</P>
<P>FOR the <HI>Third,</HI> As in <HI>Gen.</HI> 42.25. Then <HI>Jo|&s;eph</HI> commanded to fill their Sacks with <HI>Corn,</HI> or <HI>Food.</HI></P>
<P>IN all the&s;e Places, the Original is expre&s;&s;ed with one Word, namely, <HI>Bar.</HI></P>
<P>NOW &s;ince we have di&s;covered and found out the true Meaning of this Word <HI>Bar,</HI> I am apt to think, the Author of the <HI>Second P&s;alm,</HI> who doubt|le&s;s &s;poke by Divine In&s;piration, &s;at down the Word <HI>Bar</HI> and not the Word <HI>Ben,</HI> which &s;ignifies a <HI>Son,</HI> more immediately, not by Chance or acci|dentally, as &s;ome prophane Writers do, but pro|videntially, to &s;how and teach that Chri&s;t that was to come in the Fulne&s;s of Time, was not on|ly
<PB N="13" REF="002324_0093_0FDB247B1550B5F8">to be a <HI>Son</HI> of the Mo&s;t High, as the Word <HI>Ben</HI> would &s;ignify, but that <HI>He</HI> was to be a <HI>pure and clean Son,</HI> indeed, without Spot or Blemi&s;h; and not only &s;o, but that he &s;hould be the true <HI>Corn and Food</HI> indeed to all tho&s;e that believe in him.</P>
<P>THAT he was the Son of the Living God, is evident in this P&s;alm 2.7. <HI>The Lord &s;aid unto me, Thou art my Son;</HI> and in Mat. 3 17. <HI>And lo, a Voice from Heaven, &s;aying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>THAT he was <HI>pure and clean</HI> is plain in I&s;ai. 53.9. <HI>He had done no Violence, neither was any De|ceit in his Mouth;</HI> and in Heb. 4.15. <HI>Yet without Sin.</HI></P>
<P>THAT he was the true <HI>Corn or Meat</HI> indeed, is manife&s;t in P&s;al. 72.16. <HI>There &s;hall be a handful of Corn upon the Top of the Mountains;</HI> and in Joh. 6.55. <HI>For my Fle&s;h is Meat indeed.</HI></P>
<P>TO demon&s;trate plainly that this P&s;alm &s;peaks concerning the Me&s;&s;ian, by their own Authors, the Book called <HI>Medra&s;h Tehelim,</HI> upon the &s;e|cond Plalm, <HI>v,</HI> 8. has this Sentence, <Q><HI>R. Iohanan</HI> &s;ays, <HI>To Three Per&s;ons we find the Holy One</HI> (i. e. <HI>God</HI>) <HI>&s;aid,</HI> Ask; <HI>namely, to King</HI> Solomon, <HI>to King</HI> Ahaz, <HI>and to King</HI> Me&s;&s;iah; <HI>to King</HI> Solomon <HI>as it is written in</HI> 1 <HI>King.</HI> 3.5. In Gibeon the Lord ap|peared unto Solomon in a Dream by Night, and God &s;aid, Ask what I &s;hall give thee; <HI>to King</HI> Ahaz <HI>as it is written in I&s;ai.</HI> 7.11.

<P>A GREAT many more In&s;tances I might bring to prove my A&s;&s;ertion, as what <HI>Rabbi Selomon Iarchi</HI> &s;ays upon &s;aid P&s;alm; but tho&s;e that are alledged will be &s;ufficient, till I find any Body what&s;oever &s;hall oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>OF this great <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> the Son of the Living God, the Prophet &s;ays, <HI>The Government &s;hall be up|on
<PB N="14" REF="002324_0094_0FDB247CEFC06938">his Shoulder.</HI> The&s;e Words may be under&s;tood in two Ways, either in a metaphorical or in a li|teral Sen&s;e. If we take them in a metaphorical Sen&s;e, they may allude to the Way and Manner of his Government all over the Univer&s;e in General, as a Viceroy under his Father, or to his Govern|ment all over his Church, &s;eeking her Welfare, to her utmo&s;t Advantage in a peculiar Manner, as we read in Mat. 11.27. <HI>All things are delivered unto me of my Father;</HI> and in John 13.3. <HI>Je&s;us knowing that the Father had given all things into his Hands.</HI> But if we under&s;tand it literally, it may have a Reference to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> which he bore upon his Shoulder, as in John 19.17. <HI>And he bear|in his Cro&s;s, went forth,</HI> &amp;c. by which Action He overcame all his Enemies, and cau&s;ed the Redemp|tion of Mankind.</P>
<P>NOW after the Prophet hath told us the <HI>Hu|manity</HI> of Chri&s;t, in the afore&s;aid Expre&s;&s;ions, in the next Place he declares unto us his <HI>Godhead:</HI> And therefore,</P>
<P>THIS great Point of Divinity, &s;o my&s;teri|ous, &s;o profound, and &s;o fathomle&s;s, that ex|cept it was revealed, it would never be believed, the Prophet opens unto us, in &s;aying, that his Name &s;hall be called, <HI>Wonderful, Coun&s;ellor, a mighty God, and Everla&s;ting Father,</HI> (as the Origi|nal carries it.)</P>
<P>FOUR particular Names the Prophet does de|clare to the Jewi&s;h Church in particular, and to the whole World in general, that the true Me&s;&s;iah (who was to come &s;ix hundred Years after) was to have, as particular Marks to di&s;tingui&s;h him from the fal&s;e ones: Namely,

AND &s;ince all the Four Titles afore&s;aid belong to God and no one el&s;e, if we find them attribu|ted to <HI>Je&s;us Christ,</HI> we may certainly conclude <HI>He</HI> is the true <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and not a <HI>Man</HI> only, but <HI>God</HI> al&s;o.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> TO his <HI>miraculous Works.</HI> If we could examine all <HI>Christ's</HI> Works, we &s;hould find he did more miraculous and wonderful Works in his Life-time, than all the Prophets together, even <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> which was to come, was to perform great and wonderful Works, &s;uch as none but God is able to act or perform, (to &s;how that he was to be the true God him&s;elf,) is clear and manife&s;t, by what the &s;ame Prophet &s;ays in the 35th Chapter of his Prophecies: Therein I find four certain Marks, wherewith we &s;hould know the true <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> from any fal&s;e one, at the Time of his coming, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> we under&s;tand &s;aid Prophecy as &s;ome do, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is the mo&s;t genuine way of any that I know.)</P>
<P>THE Words of the Prophet are as follow: <HI>Say to them that are of fearful Heart, Be &s;trong, fear not; Behold, your God will come and &s;ave you.</HI> And then follow the Marks of &s;aid Saviour, in the 5th and 6th Ver&s;es: Namely, <HI>Then the Eyes of the Blind &s;hall be opened, the Ears of the Deaf &s;hall be un&s;topped: Then the lame Man &s;hall leap as all Hart, and the Tongue of the Dumb &s;hall &s;ing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="002324_0096_0FDB25015ABE7F20">
ALL the&s;e four Marks, and a great many more, we find recorded in <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.30. agreeing to our Chri&s;t as the true <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> promi&s;ed by the Pro|phets: <HI>And great Multitudes came unto him, having with them tho&s;e that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and ca&s;t them down at Je&s;us Feet, and he healed them.</HI></P>
<P>BY the Tokens of his wonderful Works he an&s;wered to <HI>John the Baptist</HI>'s Di&s;ciples, when he &s;ent to him, to know whether he was the true <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> that was to come, or was not; as we read in Mat. 11.4. <HI>Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;aid unto them, Go and &s;hew John again tho&s;e things which ye do hear and &s;ee; the Blind receive their Sight, the Lame do walk, the Lepers are clean&s;ed, and the Deaf hear; the Dead are rai&s;ed up, and the Poor have the Go&s;|pel preached to them:</HI> Which An&s;wer plainly &s;hows the Veracity of his Mi&s;&s;ion, and the Certainty of his being the <HI>Christ</HI> promi&s;ed to the World a great many Ages before him: For, Who ever was? Who is? Or, Who ever &s;hall be able to perform &s;uch wonderful and miraculous Works? Certainly none but <HI>He,</HI> who is the very <HI>Wonderful indeed</HI> in all his Actions. None but one that is God as well as Man, could act as he did. Let all the Powers above or beneath, or both together, convene and join For|ces, and try whether they can do the &s;ame. If they cannot, as certainly they can't, then let us be a&s;&s;ured whoever did thus is the true <HI>Me&s;&s;iah, God</HI> as well as <HI>Man.</HI></P>

IN the Old Te&s;tament, <HI>as it &s;hould be,</HI> we and it in I&s;ai. 7.14. <HI>Behold, a Virgin &s;hall con|ceive, and bear a Son;</HI> (this is the very &s;ame <HI>Son</HI> that we are di&s;cour&s;ing upon,) and afterwards con|firmed by the Prophet <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.22. when he &s;ays, <HI>The Lord hath created a new thing in the Earth, a Woman &s;hall compa&s;s a Man:</HI> Which Words, with Submi&s;&s;ion, I verily think are to be under&s;tood of Chri&s;t's wonderful Conception, becau&s;e it was a new Thing indeed, and a thing never heard before, <HI>i. e.</HI> that a <HI>Virgin</HI> &s;hould conceive and incompa&s;s a Man; el&s;e, if it was by the ordinary Cour&s;e of Nature, what new Thing would that be? And if it was by the Knowledge of a Man, then &s;he was no more a Vir|gin: And the Prophet calls her a Virgin when &s;he &s;hould conceive; <HI>Ergo,</HI> it was done by none, or without Man's Knowledge, (<HI>i. e.</HI> by the ordinary Cour&s;e of Nature,) but in a &s;upernatural Way.</P>
<P N="2">2. CONFIRMED in the New Te&s;tament, <HI>as it came to pa&s;s.</HI> We find it recorded in <HI>Mat.</HI> 1.18. giving an Account how the Birth of Chri&s;t was, he &s;ays the following Words, <HI>The Birth of Chri&s;t was on this wi&s;e, when as his Mother Mary was e&s;pou&s;ed to Jo&s;eph, before they came together, &s;he was found with Child of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, &s;ince the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> promi&s;ed by the Pro|phets, was to be conceived in a different Way from others, namely, in a &s;upernatural Way without the Knowledge of any Man; and &s;ince <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> was &s;o conceived as the Evangeli&s;t plainly doth relate and affirm, let us be entirely &s;atisfied that <HI>He</HI> is the true <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> that was promi&s;ed of old; and &s;o to his Conception the Word <HI>Wonderful</HI> may have a Reference.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THIS Word <HI>Wonderful</HI> may have &s;ome Reference to the <HI>astoni&s;hing Work of Man's Re|demption.</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="002324_0098_0FDB248120FC80F8">This Thing, take it as it is, is &s;o won|derful and &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing, that the Angels them|&s;elves did greatly admire, and de&s;ire to look into it, as it is recorded in the 1 Pet. 1.12. <HI>Which Things the Angels de&s;ire to look into.</HI></P>
<P>THEREFORE, Let us conclude this Point, that this Word <HI>Wonderful</HI> doth refer to his <HI>won|derful Works,</HI> or to his <HI>&s;upernatural Way of Con|ception,</HI> or to his <HI>a&s;toni&s;hing Work of Redemption</HI> in <HI>particular,</HI> or to all of them in <HI>general:</HI> And let all tho&s;e that can't &s;how any other Per&s;on to whom the&s;e Things belong, &s;top their defiled Mouths and Railings, and cry with us, in Admiration, the Words of the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 104.24. <HI>O Lord, how manifold are thy Works, in Wi&s;dom ha&s;t thou made them all.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THE &s;econd Title the Prophet gives to the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> which was to come, is, <HI>Coun&s;eller.</HI> This Title may be applyed to Chri&s;t in two Re|&s;pects: Namely, with re&s;pect,</P>
<P N="1">1. TO the good Coun&s;els <HI>He</HI> gave to his Di&s;|ciples and Hearers, when he was upon Earth.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="2">2. TO the Publication of the New Te&s;tamant.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> WITH re&s;pect to the <HI>good Coun&s;els he gave to his Di&s;ciples and Hearers, when he was upon Earth.</HI> This is &s;o infallibly true, that I do not remember any Body, directly or indirectly, did ever accu&s;e him of &s;tirring up the People of any Rank or Quality, again&s;t any of their Superiours; but the contrary we may &s;ee in the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle of <HI>Peter,</HI> the &s;econd Chapter throughout.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IT refers to the <HI>Publication of the New Testament.</HI> This was prophecied above five hun|dred Years before his coming, by the Prophet Jer. 21.31, 32. <HI>Behold, the Days come faith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and with the Hou&s;e of Judah: not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers, in the Day
<PB N="19" REF="002324_0099_0FDB248298205888">that I took them by the Hand to bring them out of the Land of Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>ANY Body may plainly &s;ee, that the Prophet in this Place doth prophecy now God would make a <HI>new Covenant,</HI> and give a <HI>new Law</HI> to his Church at the Fulne&s;s of Time, at the coming of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> quite different from that Law he gave them at the Time of their coming out of Egypt; a Law which we &s;hould be guided by, becau&s;e on the fulfilling what is therein contained, doth depend the Salvation of our immortal Souls.</P>
<P>THE Jewi&s;h <HI>Rabbies</HI> of late, when they are pre&s;&s;ed with this Prophecy, an&s;wer, That it is not to be under&s;tood as we &s;ay, (namely, that the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is to give a new Law for us to be guided by,) becau&s;e the Word <HI>Law</HI> is not expre&s;&s;ed in the Ver&s;e, but a <HI>Covenant,</HI> which doth imply a new Reformation of the old Covenant, or el&s;e a new Confirmation of the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> To this I an&s;wer.</P>
<P>IT is true, that in this Place the Word is <HI>Berith,</HI> which &s;ignifies a <HI>Covenant;</HI> but I find the Law which God gave in Mount <HI>Sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> to the Jewi&s;h Nation in particular, is called <HI>Berith</HI> al|&s;o, as in Exod. 34.28. <HI>And he wrote upon the Ta|bles the Words <HI>Nauberith</HI> of the Covenant, the Ten Commandments.</HI> In both Places the Expre&s;&s;ion is alike, <HI>i. e. Berith;</HI> and if the Law was called <HI>Berith,</HI> and the New Te&s;tament is called <HI>Berith</HI> al&s;o, I do not &s;ee what Difference they can ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> between the two <HI>Berithiyoth <HI>Covenants.</HI></HI> Neither do I &s;ee but that the <HI>&s;ame Words</HI> being u&s;ed thus, may be very well brought to prove the Publi&s;hment of the New-Te&s;tament, as a new Law after Chri&s;t's coming.</P>
<P>BUT they &s;ay again, that this An&s;wer is not &s;ufficient, becau&s;e the Word <HI>Torau</HI> which &s;igni|fieth a <HI>Law</HI> more immediately, is not expre&s;&s;ed in
<PB N="20" REF="002324_0100_0FDB2486B0A61230">the Text; and in Ca&s;e the Prophet had meant, that a new Law &s;hould be given at Chri&s;t's coming, he would &s;ay <HI>Torau,</HI> and not <HI>Berith.</HI></P>
<P>TO an&s;wer this Objection, I think 'tis requi&s;ite only to per&s;wade them to read with Attention the following Ver&s;e, and there they will find how the &s;ame Prophet calls this very <HI>Covenant</HI> which he calls before <HI>Berith,</HI> by the Name <HI>Torau.</HI> The 33d Ver&s;e runs thus, <HI>But this &s;hall be <HI>Nauberith the</HI></HI> Covenant <HI>that I will make with the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, after tho&s;e Days, faith the Lord, I will put <HI>Torauthee,</HI></HI> my Law <HI>in their inward Parts,</HI> &amp;c. where we &s;ee the Prophet called the <HI>Covenant</HI> which he mentioned before, <HI>my Law,</HI> to remove all manner of Doubts of its being under&s;tood for the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> as they &s;ay.</P>
<P>BUT it may be the Brightne&s;s of God's Word will not at once let them &s;ee the Truth of our Doctrine; as a great many times it happens to tho&s;e who from the Dark, on a &s;udden come, or are brought to the Light, that the Clearne&s;s and Brightne&s;s of the Sun, makes them to be blinder than they were before, not Becau&s;e the Sun is dark in it &s;elf, but becau&s;e they are &s;o naturalized to Darkne&s;s, that the Excellency of the Sun's Light is too &s;trong for them: Therefore I &s;hall take another Method with them, to let them &s;ee the Brightne&s;s of our Doctrine if I can, namely, by quoting to them &s;ome of their own Authors, by which Means, I hope to bring them by Degrees out of Darkne&s;s, to &s;ee the Brightne&s;s of the <HI>Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> even to the Knowledge of the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and the Doctrine pre&s;cribed by him in the New Law, or the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>IN that famous Book called <HI>Mechiltau</HI> upon the Words of the 9th Ver&s;e of the 26th Chapter of <HI>Leviticus,</HI> which &s;ays, <HI>I will e&s;tabli&s;h my Covenant with you,</HI> has the following Sentence, viz. <Q><HI>And I
<PB N="21" REF="002324_0101_0FDB2488A18ED9D0">will establi&s;h my Covenant with you, not as the fir&s;t Covenant was which you have anulled and bro|ken,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but a new Covenant that &s;hall endure for ever, as it is written, Jer.</HI> 31.31. Behold, the Days come &s;aith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and with the Hou&s;e of Judah.</Q></P>
<P>THESE Words do plainly &s;how, that the <HI>Rab|bies of old,</HI> under&s;tood that God would give a new Law at the coming of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and they prove it from this Text al&s;o, whatever the <HI>modern Rabbies</HI> do under&s;tand now.</P>
<P>AND becau&s;e by the Mouth of two Witne&s;&s;es every thing is to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, I &s;hall bring ano|ther Witne&s;s of their own, which will atte&s;t the Certainty of our Doctrine, and then in ca&s;e they wont hearken to it, but remain in their <HI>Judai&s;m,</HI> I &s;hall leave the Ca&s;e with him who is able to open their Under&s;tanding, in the Time appointed according to his Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>IN that ancient and famous Book of theirs, called <HI>Medra&s;h Koelleth,</HI> upon the la&s;t Word of the 11th Chapter of <HI>Eccle&s;iastes,</HI> is recorded the fol|lowing Sentence, <Q><HI>Vanity; <HI>The Law which a Man learns in this World is Vanity in Compari&s;on of, or before the</HI></HI> Me&s;&s;iah's <HI>Law.</HI></Q></P>
<P>OUT of &s;aid Sentence any Body may plainly &s;ee, not only that they call it expre&s;ly the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah's LAW,</HI> but that they al&s;o &s;ay, <HI>this</HI> is &s;o much bet|ter than the <HI>former,</HI> that the fir&s;t Law is a meer <HI>Vanity</HI> in Compari&s;on to the latter, <HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>Me&s;&s;i|ah's LAW,</HI> and not <HI>COVENANT,</HI> to avoid any Mi&s;takes for the Time en&s;uing.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THE third Title the Prophet gives the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> is, <HI>A mighty God.</HI> This is a Title that cer|tainly cannot &s;how any thing el&s;e but that he is <HI>God</HI> as well as <HI>Man.</HI> The Name <HI>Ale,</HI> which &s;ig|nifieth <HI>strong God,</HI> (from the Root <HI>Auyall He
<PB N="22" REF="002324_0102_0FDB248A179DA398">&s;trengthned,</HI>) and which King <HI>David</HI> gives to <HI>God the Father,</HI> in P&s;al. 95.3. <HI>For the Lord is a great God,</HI> the Prophet gives to the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> in this Place. Whereas, in ca&s;e the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was to be a Man only, as the modern Jews (and &s;andry Here|ticks in the Church did and do) &s;uppo&s;e, I am apt to think the Prophet would never have call'd him <HI>Ale Gibbor, <HI>A mighty God.</HI></HI></P>
<P>THE modern Jewi&s;h <HI>Rabbies</HI> to avoid this Di|fficulty, do &s;ay, that the Name of <HI>Ale, God,</HI> &s;igni|fieth a great many Times in the Scriptures, a <HI>Judge,</HI> &amp;c. and therefore out of this Place the Divinity of Chri&s;t cannot be proved. To this I an&s;wer.</P>
<P>ALTHO' it is true, as they &s;ay, yet among all tho&s;e Judges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are called <HI>God</HI> or <HI>Gods</HI> in holy Writ, we never find that any of them are cal|led <HI>Jehovah,</HI> but <HI>Aloim</HI> only. Therefore if I find a Place where Chri&s;t is called with the tremen|dous and fearful Name <HI>Jehovah,</HI> which is the &s;ame by which God the Father is known, I hope they will be &s;atisfied he is God al&s;o; &s;ince this is a Name called the <HI>Tetragrammaton,</HI> which they have in &s;uch <HI>&s;uperstitious Veneration,</HI> that they wont pronounce it, not only upon common Occa&s;i|ons, (for this would be a very pious and religious Principle indeed,) but refu&s;e to call upon God by this Name even in their publick or private Wor|&s;hip, or in reading the holy Scriptures, which is al|together without Warrant.</P>
<P>THE Place where Chri&s;t is called <HI>Jehovah,</HI> is plainly to be &s;een in the Prophet <HI>Jer.</HI> 23.5, 6. which is as follows, <HI>Behold, the Days come &s;aith the Lord, I will rai&s;e upon David a righteous Branch, and a King &s;hall reign and pro&s;per, and &s;hall execute Judgment and Justice in the Earth. In his Days Ju|dah &s;hall be &s;aved, and I&s;rael &s;hall dwell &s;afely: and this is his Name whereby he &s;hall be called, <HI>Jehoush</HI> our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="002324_0103_0FDB248BB3026538">
THIS Prophecy they do acknowledge to be un|der&s;tood of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah;</HI> and in it we plainly &s;ee, how the Prophet called him <HI>Jehovah,</HI> to teach us the great and high My&s;tery of the <HI>Godhead</HI> of Chri&s;t; becau&s;e the Deliverance of the Church from the Captivity of Satan, was to be wrought by one that had the Power over him, and not by Man; for this was impo&s;&s;ible for any to perform, except God him&s;elf, who was and is her true <HI>Saviour</HI> and <HI>Deliverer.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the modern <HI>Jewi&s;h Rabbies</HI> are pre&s;&s;ed with this Argument, they &s;ay, that the Name <HI>Jehovah</HI> is not a Name given to God only, but to &s;undry other Things al&s;o, as in Gen. 22.14. <HI>Abra|ham</HI> called the Name of that Place where he was to &s;acrifice his Son <HI>I&s;aac, <HI>Jehovah</HI> will &s;ee;</HI> and not only <HI>Abraham,</HI> but even <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf, after <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> fought and di&s;comfited the <HI>Hamalikites,</HI> did build an Altar unto the Lord, and called it <HI>Jehovah</HI> &s;aying, <HI>Jehovah Ne&s;ee, <HI>Exod.</HI></HI> 17.15. <HI>Gideon</HI> the Captain, after he had &s;uch good News, <HI>i. e.</HI> that he
&s;hould not die for the <HI>Sight</HI> he had &s;een before, did build an Altar unto the Lord, and called it <HI>Jehovah Shallow</HI> Judg. 6.24. The Prophet <HI>Ezek.</HI> 48.35. after he gave a De&s;cription of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> rerre&s;tial (as they &s;ay) he called it <HI>Jehovah <HI>there.</HI></HI> Therefore (they &s;ay) &s;ince we &s;ee, &s;aid Name is applied by &s;uch Pillars of the Church as <HI>Abraham, Mo&s;es, Gi|deon</HI> and <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> to other Things, <HI>i. e.</HI> the fir&s;t to a <HI>Mountain,</HI> the &s;econd and third to <HI>Altars,</HI> and the fourth to a <HI>City,</HI> and all are inanimate Creatures, far below the Dignity of a Man, and yet no Body can &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e they are &s;o called, that they are God; with much more Rea&s;on may we attribute &s;aid Name to the Me&s;&s;iah as a <HI>Man,</HI> who is of more Dignity than Stones are, without his being more <HI>God</HI> than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ince the An&s;wer to this Objection, which
<PB N="24" REF="002324_0104_0FDB248FC894BB48">&s;eems to have &s;ome Weight in it, has been di&s;tinct|ly given by &s;undry of our Divines, I &s;hall not med|dle with it at large, but only bring a couple of Authorities of their own ancient <HI>Rabbies,</HI> very au|thentical with them, which &s;hall &s;how the con|trary of what they argue, and e&s;tabli&s;h the Cer|tainty of our Doctrine. The&s;e are as follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE fir&s;t is <HI>Maimonides,</HI> who in his famous Book called <HI>Mora Neboohim,</HI> in the &s;ixty-fir&s;t Chapter of the fir&s;t Part, treating upon the different Names, or Attributes which we find the Prophets did give to God, &s;ays thus, <Q><HI>All the Names of the mo&s;t High which are found in the Books, (i. e.</HI> of the Bible,) <HI>are derived from his Actions, and that which has no Derivation in it, is only one,</HI> i. e. <HI>the</HI> Tetragrammaton, <HI>which is appropriated to the mo&s;t High only; therefore it is called a</HI> declared <HI>Name, which &s;ignifyeth the very E&s;&s;ence of the mo&s;t High, with clear Demonstration, in which there is no Equal or Partner with him. But the re&s;t of his Names, i. e.</HI> Judge, Mighty, Righteous, Merci|ful, God, <HI>&amp;c. are all Names which declare the Effects and Derivation,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But the</HI> Tetragram|maton <HI>Name is unknown as yet as to its certain Derivation, and therefore it is attributed to him only.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2">2. THE &s;econd is that which is recorded in that ancient Book of theirs, called <HI>Medra&s;h Achau,</HI> which is an Expo&s;ition upon <HI>Lamentations.</HI> Up|on the &s;ixteenth Ver&s;e of the fir&s;t Chapter, and upon the Words, <HI>Becau&s;e the Comforter is far from me,</HI> it brings in the following Sentence, <Q><HI>Rabbi <HI>Abau</HI> the Son of <HI>Rahaunah</HI></HI> (it being asked him before what the Comforters Name was to be) <HI>&s;aid, <HI>Jehovah</HI> is his Name, as it is written in Jer.</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.5.

<P><PB N="25" REF="002324_0105_0FDB2490F2B6E130">
NOW, out of &s;aid Authorities I gather two Things of a very great Con&s;equence, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. THE Name called the <HI>Tetragrammaton,</HI> is of &s;uch Excellency and Veneration, that it is to be at|tributed only to God, as the Supream Being, and no none el&s;e, becau&s;e they are all Creatures.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>Comforter</HI> of I&s;rael was to be called by &s;aid Name; from whence I draw a very fair Con|clu&s;ion, even according to their own Principles, that Chri&s;t the <HI>Comforter</HI> was a true <HI>God,</HI> &s;ince he is called in the Scriptures by that Name which none but God is to be called by
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How the Scriptures are to be under&s;tood, when the &s;aid Name is given to &s;undry Things. &s;ee <HI>Rab|bi Selomo Jarchi</HI> upon &s;aid Texts.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS Doctrine of Chri&s;t's <HI>DIVINITY,</HI> is &s;o certain and &s;o true an one, that altho' a great many Hereticks in and out of the Church did que&s;tion it, I find one of the fir&s;t Writers in the primitive Ages, calls who&s;oever &s;hould preach that there was but one God alone, &s;o as to take away the <HI>Divinity</HI> of Chri&s;t, a <HI>Devil,</HI> and an <HI>Enemy of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> (<HI>Ignatius</HI> at <HI>Antioch.</HI>)</P>
<P>NOW, &s;ince we have ju&s;tified our Cau&s;e, (even by their own Authorities, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Son of Man</HI> is not only a <HI>Man</HI> but <HI>God</HI> al&s;o,) I &s;hall go on to con&s;ider the fourth &amp; la&s;t Title the Prophet gives to the Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly and lastly,</HI> THE Me&s;&s;iah is called an <HI>Everla&s;ting Father.</HI> Here as to this Title we mu&s;t be very careful how we under&s;tand it; for altho' the Prophet called him &s;o, yet he doth not mean in that Sen&s;e of Divine Paternity, and with that peculiar and evangelical Epithet whereby we ac|knowledge in our Creed, the <HI>first Per&s;on</HI> of the ever ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Trinity;</HI> becau&s;e if we &s;hould under&s;tand it &s;o, we &s;hould fall into a gro&s;s Error (God forbid:) But this Title of <HI>an Everlasting Father,</HI> is to be under|&s;tood
<PB N="26" REF="002324_0106_0FDB249256B7A898">in this Place, as attributed to the <HI>Son</HI> in an allegorical Sen&s;e, or as a relative Title, and no more.</P>
<P>TO under&s;tand &s;aid Title fully, it is requi&s;ite to have recour&s;e to the Original, and after a due Enquiry, with all Reverence and Submi&s;&s;ion, we hope to find the true Meaning of it.

JESUS CHRIST was to be called a <HI>Father,</HI> not as a Generator, as I &s;aid before, but as a <HI>Regenera|tor;</HI> and he was &s;o, as in Mat. 19.28. <HI>And Je&s;ue &s;aid unto them, Verily I &s;ay unto you, that ye which have followed me in the Regeneration, when the Son of Man &s;hall &s;it in the Throne of his Glory, ye &s;hall &s;it upon twelve Thrones.</HI></P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST was to be called a <HI>Patriarch</HI> of many Nations, as he is the Father of all tho&s;e that believe in him to be ju&s;tified; as in Acts 13.39. <HI>And by him all that believe are justifyed from all things.</HI></P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST was to be called a <HI>Doctor,</HI> or a <HI>Rabbi,</HI> and &s;o he was, as in Joh. 3.2. <HI>Nichodemus came to Je&s;us by Night, and &s;aid unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a Teacher come from God.</HI></P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST was to be called a <HI>King,</HI> as in Zech. 9.9. <HI>Behold, thy King cometh unto thee.</HI> And in Rev. 17.14. <HI>And the Lamb &s;hall overcome them, for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.</HI></P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST was to called an <HI>Inventor,</HI> as he was to invent and in&s;titute another Sort of Government, far better than the former, for the Propagation and Welfare of his Church, as he is the Head of it; as in Eph. 5.23. <HI>Even as Chri&s;t is the Head of the Church.</HI></P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST was to be called a <HI>De&s;ire,</HI> be|cau&s;e he has been always de&s;irable to all Nations, even to this Day, by tho&s;e that wait for him; as we read in Hag. 2.7. <HI>And the De&s;ire of all Natione &s;hall come.</HI></P>
<P>I NOW pa&s;s to the third Head.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THE third Point of the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion, which the Prophet &s;peaks of in this Place, is to &s;how <HI>what &s;ort of Government the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould bear, and how long it &s;hould last.</HI> This is
<PB N="28" REF="002324_0108_0FDB2498884A5468">declared in the la&s;t Part of the Text; namely. <HI>The Prince of Peace; of the Increa&s;e of his Government and Peace no end.</HI></P>
<P>TWO Points are comprehended under this Head: Namely,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>WHAT Sort of Government he &s;hould bear.</HI> And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>HOW long it &s;hould la&s;t.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>FOR the fir&s;t, When the Prophet has a mind to declare, that Chri&s;t's Government &s;hould be with Peace and Amity, with Love and Union, without Jarrs and Debates, he &s;ays, <HI>The Prince of Peace;</HI> and in a way of <HI>Anadiplo&s;is,</HI> he repeats the &s;ame at the End. This Manner of Government we find Je|&s;us Chri&s;t did preach, and nothing el&s;e, as it is plain to be &s;een in &s;undry Places of the New Te&s;tament, Mat. 9.50. <HI>And have Peace one with ano|ther.</HI> Rom. 12.18. <HI>Live peaceably with all Men.</HI> Heb. 12.14. <HI>Follow Peace with all Men,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THIS is that univer&s;al Peace the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 2.4. doth foretell &s;hould be at the Time of Chri&s;t's Appearance; and &s;o it came to pa&s;s, as may be evidenced in that General Peace that was thro' the whole World at the Time of his coming; as we read in <HI>Luke</HI> 2.1. Concerning the Tax that was &s;aid upon all the World by <HI>Ca&s;ar Augustus</HI>'s De|cree.</P>
<P>HERE the Jewi&s;h Doctors as the chief Oppo&s;ers of Chri&s;tianity, argue thus: <HI>Je&s;us</HI> cannot be the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> promi&s;ed by the Prophets, becau&s;e he plain|ly &s;aid, that he did not come to &s;end Peace on the Earth, but <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Variance</HI> one again&s;t another, as we read in <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.34, 35. and in <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.51. And all the Prophets in General foretold the con|trary. To this I an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I OWN that Chri&s;t &s;aid &s;o, not becau&s;e I can't help it, but becau&s;e &s;aid Expre&s;&s;ions do prove and &s;how the Veracity of our Doctrine, if we under|&s;tand it aright. If we examine the Words that
<PB N="29" REF="002324_0109_0FDB2499E1D5CDE0">Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;aid, we &s;hall not find he &s;aid, that he came to make War, (as they &s;ay,) but in <HI>Matthew</HI> 'tis &s;aid, <HI>to &s;end a Sword,</HI> and in <HI>Luke,</HI> to <HI>give a Di|vi&s;ion:</HI> Which Words are to be under&s;tood thus.</P>
<P>FOR the great Di&s;&s;affinity that there is between <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> for the great Unequality there is between <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Belial,</HI> and for the great Di&s;|proportion there is between <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Satan,</HI> Chri&s;t foretels, (as one that knew all things, as one that knew what would come to pa&s;s between his fol|lowers and tho&s;e that deny'd him,) that the time would come, when the preaching of his everla&s;ting Go&s;pel would make a Divi&s;ion between the&s;e two Parties, as if a Sword had cut them a&s;under; not becau&s;e the Nature of the Go&s;pel it &s;elf is to bring Divi&s;ions and Jarrs among the true Believers, for we know to the contrary, both by Records, and (what is more convincing) by our own Experience: But from the great Enmity that there is between God and Satan, the Divi&s;ion between the two Par|ties doth proceed, as contrary and oppo&s;ite one to the other. But the Go&s;pel it &s;elf produces no|thing but good Will and Friend&s;hip among true Believers, as it is recorded in Acts 4.32. <HI>And the multitude of them that believed were of one Heart, and of one Soul.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>HOW long &s;aid Government &s;hould last.</HI> This is plain and manife&s;t in the next Words, <HI>Of the Increa&s;e of his Government and Peace no End.</HI></P>
<P>IF we examine Hi&s;tories, we &s;hall find that all the Monarchs and Potentates of the World that have been &s;ince the Creation, have proved hither|to very frail and peri&s;hing ones, (altho' they &s;hew to be as firm as Rocks, in the Time of their Domi|nion and Government, as the Chronologers are ve|ry well informed,) except the Dominion and Go|vernment of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: <HI>This,</HI> in&s;tead of decrea|&s;ing, every Day grows bigger and bigger, altho' it
<PB N="30" REF="002324_0110_0FDB249B851F9988">began with the mo&s;t unlikely Means imaginable. So this Dominion the Prophet &s;ays, &s;hall never come to an End, but &s;hall be permanent and du|rable for ever; <HI>Of the Increa&s;e of his Government and Peace no end.</HI></P>
<P>THE Meaning of the Words, <HI>No End,</HI> (that in the Original is <HI>Rets</HI> from the Root <HI>Kautzautz He did cut,</HI>) is as much as to &s;ay, <HI>It &s;hall never be cut off,</HI> but it &s;hall increa&s;e every Day till the Ful|ne&s;s of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> do come in, and next the <HI>Jew|i&s;h Nation,</HI> as a Body, being all under one Shepherd, the great Bi&s;hop of Souls, and until the Work &s;hall be fini&s;hed, and our <HI>Lord Je&s;us Christ</HI> &s;hall re|turn every thing to <HI>God the Father,</HI> with &s;ubduing all his Enemies under his Feet, and de&s;troying all his Adver&s;aries, even Death it &s;elf, and all the <HI>Elect</HI> obtain and enjoy everla&s;ting Happine&s;s with him in eternal Glory, as it has been promi&s;ed by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.24, 25, 26, 27.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> THE fourth and la&s;t Point of Chri&s;tia|nity the Prophet &s;peaks of in this Prophecy, is, <HI>How,</HI> or <HI>from whom the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould proceed.</HI> This Point has two Con&s;iderations: Namely,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. HOW. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. FROM whom.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>FOR the fir&s;t, <HI>How.</HI> This may be an&s;wered two Ways.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Negatively. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Affirmatively.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>NEGATIVELY:</HI> Not of a married Wo|man, as other lawful Children are, which by the Cour&s;e of Nature are born and propagated. But,</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>AFFIRMATIVELY:</HI> Of a <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>immaculate Virgin,</HI> and not from any Virgin what&s;oever, but from one who&s;e Name was to be called <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="002324_0111_0FDB249CDCAF98F0">
THESE two my&s;terious Points the Prophet doth foretel in the Word, <HI>Of the Increa&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>TO under&s;tand this Doctrine, 'tis requi&s;ite for us to have recour&s;e to the Original, el&s;e it will be never under&s;tood.</P>
<P>THE Word in the Original is <HI>Lemar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a, Of the Increa&s;e,</HI> Said Word is wrote with a final <HI>Mem</HI> in the middle, contrary to all the Grammar Rules; and it is that only Word which is wrote &s;o in the whole Bible. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Printer's Fault, but the contrary; in ca&s;e it was not &s;o wrote, it would have been counted an Er|ror.</P>
<P>I AM prone to think, the Penman of this Book, with a great and particular Providence, did write it &s;o, to &s;how us the Doctrine we are upon. To prove that it is done providentially, it requires us only to take Notice, how the Jewi&s;h Wri|ters for the Pre&s;ervation of the holy Scriptures, have taken the Care to adverti&s;e their Synagogue, for the Pre&s;ervation of &s;aid Word, and to write it in the &s;ame Manner, and no otherways, altho' they under&s;tood not the Meaning of it; and I am apt to think &s;ince the Beginning it was kept &s;o, as we have it now. I remember the Words of one of their Rabbies commenting upon &s;aid Word, wrote with a <HI>Clo&s;e,</HI> or final <HI>Mem</HI> in the Middle, &s;ays thus, <HI>Mem clo&s;ed</HI> (in this Place) <HI>a clo&s;e or a my&s;terious thing &s;ignifyeth."</HI> And tho' he doth not tell what, either becau&s;e he would not, or becau&s;e he knew not; neverthele&s;s, he knew that &s;o it &s;hould be, and that &s;o it was from the Beginning, otherwi&s;e, if he (or any other) knew any thing to the contrary, they would certainly, have told it. In the Margin of &s;ome of our corrected Bibles, I find this <HI>Adverti&s;ement</HI> &s;et down as a <HI>Monument,</HI> that every Body &s;hould take Notice of it, i. e. <Q><HI>A clo&s;e Mem</HI> (mu&s;t be &s;et) <HI>in the middle of the
<PB N="32" REF="002324_0112_0FDB24A0AA35A618">Word.</HI></Q> Therefore to think that all the <HI>Admo|nitions</HI> and <HI>margin Writings</HI> in Company with the Antiquity of the Book, &s;hould be &s;et and re|corded ca&s;ually and by Chance, I cannot join with tho&s;e that think &s;o, but believe it doth &s;ignify the&s;e two Points: Namely,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>HOW.</HI> And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>FROM whom</HI> Chri&s;t &s;hould proceed.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>&rindx; FOR the fir&s;t, <HI>How.</HI> If we take notice of the Shape of &s;aid Letter, we &s;hall find it &s;haped with four Corners, thus, &square; clo&s;ed in all Parts, to &s;how that the Mother of our Lord was to be a <HI>pure Virgin,</HI> clo&s;ed without being known by any Body carnally, but over&s;hadowed by the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;econd, <HI>From whom.</HI> Not from any <HI>Virgin</HI> what&s;oever, but from one who&s;e Name was to be called <HI>MARY,</HI> and no other. This is de|ciphered in &s;aid Letter, which is the fir&s;t of the Letters which the Name <HI>Miriam</HI> or <HI>Mary</HI> begins with, and according to this Prediction, in the Ful|ne&s;s of Time it exactly came to pa&s;s, as we read in Mat. 1.18. <HI>Now the Birth of Je&s;us Chri&s;t was on this wi&s;e: Whenas his mother Mary was e&s;pou|&s;ed to Jo&s;eph, before they came together, &s;he was found with Child of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> And the &s;ame is recorded in Luk. 1.27.</P>
<P>TO confirm this Doctrine, 'tis to be ob&s;erved, that the Scripture for the mo&s;t Part, when it mentions Chri&s;t's Mother, it doth it with both Names together, i. e. <HI>Virgin,</HI> and <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, &s;ince I have been long enough in open|ing the true Meaning of this Prophecy, how it is to be under&s;tood, according to the Catholick Sen&s;e of it, it is time for me to take a View of what the modern <HI>Jewi&s;h Witters</HI> or <HI>Rabbies</HI> do &s;ay upon it, <HI>i. e.</HI> tho&s;e that bear the bigge&s;t Sway now-a-days in their Synagogue. And with what has been &s;aid,
<PB N="33" REF="002324_0113_0FDB24A227F45520">I hope the Fallacy of their Interpretation will ap|pear clearly to our Sight.</P>
<P>THE modern Jewi&s;h Writers, &s;uch as <HI>Rabbi Me|na&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Ben J&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Rabbi J&s;aac Abrabanel, &amp;c.</HI> do, fir&s;t, <HI>Affirmatively</HI> &s;ay (whatever their Prede|ce&s;&s;ors &s;aid to the contrary) that the Child the Prophet here &s;peaks of in this Place, and in the 7th Chapter, is concerning <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> King <HI>Abaz</HI>'s Son, becau&s;e in his Days they were delivered from the great Oppre&s;&s;ion that the Hou&s;e of <HI>David</HI> was un|der by the Confederacy of two great and mighty Kings, i. e. <HI>Razin</HI> King of <HI>Syria,</HI> and <HI>Pekah</HI> King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who did convene together with the Strength of their Armies again&s;t <HI>Abaz</HI> King of <HI>Ju|dah,</HI> as in the 7th Chapter of this Prophe&s;y; and in this Sen&s;e God was with them in a wonderful Manner, and delivered them with &s;uch unexpected Deliverance; and he, King <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> was the Child <HI>I manuel</HI> foretold by the Prophet, becau&s;e in his Days God was with them in a wonderful Man|ner.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly, NEGATIVELY,</HI> (they &s;ay,) The Child &s;poken of by the Prophet, has no Reference at all to the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> for three Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> (THEY &s;ay,) How is is po&s;&s;ible, that that which was to come &s;ix hundred Years after, could be taken for a Sign of Comfort of their be|ing delivered from the Terrors and Dangers they were under at the Time when the Prophet delive|red his Me&s;&s;age? Would it be a Comfort to any Man that was lame, or weak, or with any Bodily Di&s;ea&s;e, to tell him &s;uch News, namely, that his Po&s;terity five or &s;ix hundred Years after he was dead and rotten, &s;hould be &s;ound, &s;trong, and in good Health? What cares any Body for &s;uch News; or what does any Body care for &s;uch Com|forts, &s;o long as he that &s;uffers is not to be the better for it?</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="002324_0114_0FDB24A3D5810528">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> THE &s;econd Rea&s;on why this Prophe|cy cannot be under&s;tood of the Me&s;&s;iah, (they &s;ay) is, becau&s;e the Word is in the Preterite Ten&s;e, <HI>Vauikrau, And he called.</HI> Whereas, if it was a Prophecy that was to be under&s;tood of a Thing which &s;hould come to pa&s;s &s;ome hundreds of Years hence, the Word would be <HI>Vackaura, And he &s;hall be called,</HI> in the future Ten&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THE the third Rea&s;on why it doth not concern the Me&s;&s;iah, (they &s;ay) is, becau&s;e all the Titles de&s;cribed in it, as. <HI>Wonderful, Coun&s;eller, A mighty God,</HI> and <HI>An everla&s;ting Father,</HI> are Titles belonging properly to God, and not to Man; and only the Title of <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> is the Title of the Per&s;on the Prophet &s;peaks of, which is King <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> or any Body el&s;e what&s;oever, the Me&s;&s;ah excepted, as the Accents do &s;how.</P>
<P>THESE are the chief Arguments which do de|&s;erve to be taken Notice of, or are worth an&s;wer|ing: Therefore I &s;hall fir&s;t make it appear, that the Words of the Prophet cannot be under&s;tood of King <HI>Hezekiah;</HI> and &s;econdly, I &s;hall an&s;wer &s;aid Ob|jections in full; and then conclude.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> TO prove this Prophecy could not be under&s;tood of King <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> three very &s;trong Rea&s;ons may be brought or offered.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> HIS Reign not being perpetual and per|manent for ever, as the Prophet &s;ays, <HI>Of the Increa&s;e of his Government and Peace no end.</HI> But the contra|ry we read in 2 <HI>King.</HI> 18. that becau&s;e he rebelled again&s;t <HI>Sanherib</HI> King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> the War went &s;o far between them, that the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI>'s King came again&s;t him, and took all the fenced Cities of <HI>Ju|dah,</HI> and King <HI>Hezekiah</HI> was forced to buy the Peace of him for the Sum of 300 Talents of Silver and 20 Talents of Gold, which amounts (accor|ing to Mr. <HI>Clark's</HI> Computation) to the Sum of
<PB N="35" REF="002324_0115_0FDB24A71A854A98">266906 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR></HI> 5 <HI><ABBR>s.</ABBR></HI> Sterling. Now I ask, Is this to have Peace in his Dominions without end?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IF we con&s;ider <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> old King <HI>Hezekiah</HI> was when he came to reign, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all find this Pro|phecy cannot be under&s;tood fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o of him. We read in 2 <HI>King.</HI> 18.2. King <HI>Hezekiah</HI> was twenty five Years old when he began to reign. And in 2 <HI>King.</HI> 16.2. we find King <HI>Abaz</HI> his Father did reign &s;ixteen Years. Therefore it con&s;equently fol|lows, King <HI>Hezekiah</HI> could not be le&s;s than Nine Years old when this was foretold by the Prophet. Now I ask, How could he be the Child who&s;e mi|raculous Conception and wonderful Birth was here foretold, &s;ince he was already born, and by no other Way but by the ordinary Cour&s;e of Nature, contrary to the Prophet's Words, that he was to be of a Virgin?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> IF we could &s;earch all the Hi&s;tories of the Kings of <HI>Judah,</HI> or any other what&s;oever, either of the Jewi&s;h Writers, or any other Nation, we &s;hould not find that King <HI>Hezekiah</HI> was ever called by the Name <HI>Imanuel,</HI> neither as a proper, nor as an appellative Name: Therefore I do greatly ad|mire, how the modern Jewi&s;h <HI>Rabbies,</HI> and in par|ticular <HI>Rabbi Mena&s;&s;eh Ben I&s;rael,</HI> a Man of &s;uch great Learning as he was, in his <HI>Confiliador,</HI> doth maintain &s;aid Opinion, without Warrant, or any Colour of Truth.</P>
<P>NOW &s;ince we have made it appear, that this Prophecy cannot be under&s;tood of King <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> as the modern Jewi&s;h Rabbies will have it, let us go to the next, namely, to &s;ee whether we can An|&s;wer their Objections; and in Ca&s;e we can (as doubtle&s;s we &s;hall) the Whole Truth will certain|ly appear and come to Light.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> IF we examine the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;text, we &s;hall find the great Sorrow &amp; Affliction King <HI>Ahaz</HI> was under, when he &s;aw two mighty Kings joining Forces to|gether
<PB N="36" REF="002324_0116_0FDB24A81A02FB38">to come again&s;t him, from which Sight the Hearts of his Subjects together with his own, did &s;hake and move, as the Trees of the Woods are mo|ved again&s;t the Wind, left he &s;hould be de&s;troyed in Company with the whole Royal Family. God &s;ee|ing the Affliction (which certainly was great) that his Maje&s;ty King <HI>Ahaz</HI> was under, &s;ent the Prophet <HI>I&s;ai|ah</HI> to Comfort him with the&s;e agreeable &amp; Comfort|able Words; <HI>Take heed &amp; be quiet, fear not neither be faint bearted, for the Two Tails of tho&s;e &s;moaking fire Brands, the Coun&s;els &amp; Devices the&s;e two Kings have took again&s;t thee &amp; the Hou&s;e of David, &s;hall not prevail; thus &s;aith the Lord, it &s;hall not stand, neither &s;hall it come to pa&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. and then the Prophet, to e&s;tabli&s;h him in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Faith, told him, he &s;hould ask a Sign for it: But his Royal Maje&s;ty, either thro' Incredulity, or Mode&s;ty, or being certain the thing would come to pa&s;s (which I am not about to inquire into) refu|&s;ed it; yet neverthele&s;s the Prophet following his Divine In&s;piration, &s;aid unto him, <HI>Behold a Virgin &s;hall conceive end I car a Son, and</HI> (&s;he) <HI>&s;hall call his Name Imanuel, &amp;c.</HI> in which Words the Pro|phet foretold him very plainly, the E&s;tabli&s;hment of his Kingdom; becau&s;e &s;ince it was appointed from the Beginning, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Love,</HI> the <HI>Great Love</HI> that God the Father both to Mankind, to &s;end his beloved Son into the World out of the Stock of <HI>David,</HI> how could &s;aid <HI>Son,</HI> or &s;aid <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> come from &s;uch a Stock, in ca&s;e it was de&s;troyed and pe|ri&s;hed at that Time, as <HI>he</HI> thought it would? Mo&s;t certainly the Word of the Lord appointed and De|termined from all Eternity mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> come to pa&s;s; and in Ca&s;e the whole Royal Stock would Peri&s;h, as he feared, the thing would never be, which is impo&s;&s;i|ble. Therefore I &s;ay, what greater A&s;&s;urance could he have for his Deliverance? or, What greater Comfort for his Afflictions, than to have &s;uch News brought to him by a Prophet? Surely none. If &s;o,
<PB N="37" REF="002324_0117_0FDB24AA043ACF38">let us conclude, that altho' the Promi&s;e was not to come till a great many ages and Generations, after he was Dead and Rotten, yet it was a great A&s;&s;u|rance of his Deliverance, and a great alleviation of the pre&s;ent Afflictions he was under; &s;ince, if <HI>he</HI> &amp; the whole Stock &s;hould peri&s;h as he feared, the Thing appointed would never come to pa&s;s, which is contradictory in it &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THE Second Argument is, That the Prophet &s;peaks in the Preterite Ten&s;e, &amp;c.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FAITH, or Belief, is the Foundation which the whole Structure of Chri&s;tianity
de|pends upon. The Souls of true Believers are &s;o rais'd, &s;o carried, &s;o elevated,
&amp; finally &s;o tran&s;ported to the upper Man&s;ions, with the &s;weet
Contemplation of the high and pro|found My&s;teries contained in the New Te&s;tament, that none but &s;uch as have the Happine&s;s of en|joying them, can tell
or &s;ay any thing about them. The Fruits that are obtained by the Meditation and Contemplation thereof are &s;o ravi&s;hing, that none can declare them in full: Even tho&s;e who do enjoy them, find them &s;o much above their Capacities to expre&s;s, &s;o much beyond their un|der&s;tanding to declare, and &s;o &s;ublime to be com|municated and rehear&s;ed, (if ever they might come to be heard) that it would not be comprehended and under&s;tood. It is the fir&s;t fruit of the Spirit &s;aith the Apo&s;tle Paul to the Galatians. <HI>Gal. 5.22.</HI> and therefore how can any, that are De&s;titute or de|prived of &s;uch Spirit ever come to under&s;tand any thing of it? Carnal Men Laugh at the Truth and
<PB N="2" REF="002324_0123_0FDB24B71C580AE0">Orthodox Points of Chri&s;tianity, for lacking of Faith to believe them. The Doctrine of Chri&s;t crucified was to the <HI>Jews</HI> a Stumbling-block, and to the <HI>Greeks</HI> Fooli&s;hne&s;s, becau&s;e for want of Faith they could not be per&s;uaded of the Truth thereof, but it was counted in their fooli&s;h Conceits and carnal Minds, nothing but Fooli&s;hne&s;s, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.23.</P>
<P>NOW, under this Word <HI>BELIEF</HI> are inclu|ded all Points of the Chri&s;tian Religion in gene|ral, and all, I am prone to think, King <HI>David</HI> aimed at, when he expre&s;&s;ed the&s;e Words, <HI>I belie|ved;</HI> becau&s;e he being 2 Type of Chri&s;t, and know|ing the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> &s;hould come out of his Loins, af|ter his pondering and meditating upon the Truths and profound My&s;teries that were to be revealed to the Church in the Fulne&s;s of Time, he cryed out, <HI>I believed;</HI> implying in the&s;e Words, that altho' he knew he &s;hould not &s;ee that Day, neverthele&s;s he was fully &s;atisfied all tho&s;e My&s;teries, which in Pro|ce&s;s of Time God would reveal to his Elect were true; and the Rea&s;on of the Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>I was greatly afflicted,</HI> may have a Reference to the Condition he fore&s;aw the <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation</HI> would be in for their Unbelief.</P>
<P>AMONG the great, deep, and fathomle&s;s Points of Divinity, which God of his infinite Mercies was plea&s;ed to reveal, <HI>i. e.</HI> to open more clearly than he did before to his Catholick Church, is the great My&s;tery of the <HI>&s;acred &amp; ble&s;&s;ed Trinity.</HI> This Point I do now de&s;ign to prove, not to be a new Doctrine &s;ince Chri&s;t, as the modern <HI>Jews</HI> thro' a Mi&s;take &s;uppo&s;e, but from the very Beginning, with clear De|mon&s;trations out of the old Te&s;tament, and their own authentick Authors, <HI>i. e.</HI> tho&s;e that have the true under&s;tanding of the Law and of the Pro|phets, (as they &s;ay,) called by them, <HI>Baugnaula Bohmath hauameth, the Masters of the True

<P>AND before I begin, I implore God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;aying with the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 51.15. <HI>O Lord, open thou my Lips, and my Mouth &s;hall &s;hew forth thy Prai&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Point is of &s;uch Weight, and of &s;uch great Importance, that except a Man believes it, he can never be &s;aved; becau&s;e, to believe in God the <HI>Son</HI> as our <HI>Redeemer,</HI> as in <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.13. and <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.9. and in God the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> as our <HI>Sanctifier,</HI> as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 15.16. and 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.11. (Titles and Digni|ties belonging properly to God, becau&s;e none but God only can redeem and &s;anctify our Souls, as in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 130.7. and <HI>Lev.</HI> 20.8.) and at the &s;ame Time to deny the Coequalne&s;s and Coevalne&s;s of &s;he three Per&s;ons from all Eternity, &s;eems to be &s;o contrary to that Idea which the whole World of Mankind have of a God, that nothing can be more weak and ab&s;urd in it &s;elf than this is: And I am &s;ure &s;uch as do believe this Doctrine (as the <HI>Arians</HI> did of old, and &s;undry other Sects &s;ince) do believe in more Gods than one, contrary to what the Scriptures teach, and they them&s;elves pretend to affirm. And if we confider the thing aright, we &s;nall find this Bla&s;phemous Doctrine of denying the Coequality of the three Per&s;ons, hath been a great Stumbling-Block to the <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation</HI>'s Conver&s;ion, as well as the wor&s;hiping of Images by the Papi&s;ts, there being no other Difference between the&s;e two Opinions only this, <HI>viz.</HI> One wor&s;hips Idols <HI>in actu,</HI> namely, the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and the other <HI>in potentia,</HI> i. e. the <HI>Arians,</HI> &amp;c. and of the Two, I think, (if I may pa&s;s my Judgment,) the la&s;t is the wor&s;t, for two Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> BECAUSE the Poi&s;on of their idolatrous Wor&s;hip is mantled under the Cloak of &s;ome Scrip|tures,
<PB N="4" REF="002324_0125_0FDB24BA1D0C4780">which they make to be like a No&s;e of Wax, to twi&s;t and twitch which way they will, to &s;erve their Turn: Whereas the Papi&s;ts, whatever they pre|tend to &s;ay for to uphold their Opinion, or, whatever they pretend to alledge in Defence of their Image Wor&s;hip, yet the Words of the &s;econd Commandment &s;tand as Witne&s;&s;es and as Monuments, again&s;t their devili&s;h Doctrine and Di&s;tinction of <HI>Latria, Dulis,</HI> and <HI>Hyperdulta,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> BECAUSE &s;ince the <HI>Papi&s;h</HI> Wor&s;hip is &s;o plainly and openly performed, every body who hath any Light (in the lea&s;t) in the Sacred Oracles, doth plainly di&s;cover the Fal&s;ity and Erroneou&s;ne&s;s thereof, and are aware of it; But the <HI>Arians;</HI> &amp;c. do carry on their Work &s;o cunningly, and their Di&s;|putes &s;o Sophi&s;tically, and their Wor&s;hip is &s;o much like the true and Orthodox one, <HI>Ape like,</HI> that it is very difficult to perceive wherein the Gangreen lies, without it be by a good under&s;tanding Man in|deed, and therefore it is the more dangerous to be Snared and caught by them, particularly to the weak and unlearned; Wherefore as I am fully per|&s;waded, 'tis true and infallible what <HI>Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gen</HI> again&s;t <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> &s;ays in his 8.

<P>BUT &s;ince my De&s;ign at pre&s;ent, is not to meddle with the <HI>Artans,</HI> I &s;hall leave them, and turn my Face towards the <HI>Jews,</HI> who are my Brethren accor|ding to the Fle&s;h, and for whom my Heart is ready to bur&s;t, when I Seriou&s;ly think on them, to &s;ee them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in their Spiritual Darkne&s;s; and my Eyes
<PB N="5" REF="002324_0126_0FDB24BE63F638F8">do run, when I con&s;ider the forlorn State and Con|dition that they are in; namely in denying the Doc|trine of the mo&s;t Ble&s;&s;ed and &s;acred <HI>Trinity,</HI> &s;o often repeated by the Prophets of the old Te&s;tament, and the chief <HI>Rabbins</HI> among them.</P>
<P>But before I begin to quote the Authorities, for to prove my A&s;&s;ertion, I think 'tis very proper to give them to under&s;tand, what we mean when we &s;ay, We believe that God is ONE in Nature and E&s;&s;ence, and THREE in Per&s;ons, the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and afterwards make it appear, that their <HI>Rabbies,</HI> even the chief among them of old, and of late, under&s;tood and believed the &s;ame in Sub&s;tance as we do; and the True Chri&s;tians and they, differ only in Terms.</P>
<P>IN quoting their Sayings, I do purpo&s;ely de|&s;ign not to Critici&s;e upon the Words, lea&s;t they may &s;ay, that I draw and make them &s;ay what I have a mind to, but only quote &amp; Tran&s;late them Faithfully, and let them Judge afterwards.</P>
<P>ATTEND, and let us not be mi&s;taken for the Lord's Sake, becau&s;e in this, <HI>q. d.</HI> in under&s;tand|ing this Point as it &s;hould be, depends the Salvation or the Perdition of our Immortal Souls.</P>
<P>WE do not wor&s;hip, neither do we believe in Three Gods, as the Jewi&s;h Nation, through a Mi&s;take, do fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly think, But,</P>

<P>THIS is our Belief concerning the <HI>Three</HI> Per&s;ons or <HI>Degrees,</HI> and Forms of the Deity, as <HI>Tertullian</HI> doth Term them. And this Doctrine we are ready at any Time to prove, and to dye for it, if Occa&s;ion &s;hould pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>NOW to go thro' the great and manifold Train of Scripture Proofs, for to demon&s;trate my A&s;&s;erti|on, and An&s;wer all the Objections thereof, this would grow to a great Bulk contrary to my De|&s;ign at pre&s;ent, and likewi&s;e it would prove a Task &s;omewhat unnece&s;&s;ary for me to undertake, being it has been done already before now, by &s;uch as are more able than I am, and in likelyhood, than I am like to be.

Therefore, after he had repeated the moral Law, as the unalterable Word till the World's End, he tells them in General of a Colloquy that pa&s;s'd between them, of their de|&s;iring of him to be a Mediator between God and them, the Lord's hearing their Words, his Wi&s;hes for their keeping their Hearts towards God all their Days, to fear him, to keep his Command|ments, his Coun&s;el to them, and finally, the Pro|mi&s;e of God's Favour towards them, in ca&s;e they would follow his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, becau&s;e the End of the Law was the Obedience of it.</P>

<P>THE Name <HI>Jehovah</HI> is &s;o full of My&s;tery, and there are &s;o many profitable and delectable Things (<HI>i. e.</HI> &s;piritual) to be gathered out of it, as can ve|ry well be thought of any, even the wi&s;e&s;t that ever was, (in ca&s;e we do not run too fa&s;t upon Su|per&s;tition, as mo&s;t of the Jewi&s;h <HI>Rabbies</HI> do.)</P>
<P>THIS is &s;o certain, that it is the Opinion of a great many and worthy Divines, that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> Petiti|on to God to let him &s;ee his Glory, <HI>Exod.</HI> 33.18. was to let him &s;ee the high and deep My&s;teries which are included in his &s;acred and everla&s;ting Name, <HI>i. e.</HI> the great and dreadful Name <HI>Jehovah,</HI> (which who&s;oever names vainly is worthy of Death.) But &s;ince touching the Almighty we cannot find him out unto Perfection, even the be&s;t of Angels are charged with Folly, when <HI>He</HI> under|&s;tood <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> Reque&s;t, an&s;wered him, <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 20. <HI>Thou canst not &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e my Face, for no Man &s;hall &s;ee Me and Live,</HI> i. e. for you to under&s;tand in full the My&s;te|ries of my &s;acred Name, it is impo&s;&s;ible, &s;aid God, &s;o long as you are in Body and Soul together.

Therefore, let us with all Humility and holy Fear, &s;ee if we can find &s;omething included in this fathom|le&s;s Name, that may prove for our In&s;tru&s;tion and &s;piritual Comfort.</P>
<P>THAT the holy and mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Trinity eve|ry
<PB N="20" REF="002324_0141_0FDB24DD839413A0">Per&s;on by it &s;elf is called <HI>Jehovah</HI> has been de|mon&s;trated by &s;undry worthy Divines before now, who&s;e Names will be for a Ble&s;&s;ing to the Genera|tions to come. But that all the three Per&s;ons are included and comprehended in the Name <HI>Jehovah,</HI> I do not know any who have &s;hewed it before me. Therefore I &s;hall premi&s;e &s;ome things which I think are very nece&s;&s;ary to be known for the better In|telligence of it, begging the Reader's Patience for a while. <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THE Name of the Lord in the Original is, <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the Root is <HI>Kavauh,</HI> which &s;ignifieth a <HI>Being,</HI> or <HI>E&s;&s;exce.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THIS Name amounts, according to the Hebrew Numeration, to the Sum of 26. <HI>viz. Yode</HI> 10, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a</HI> 5, is 15. <HI>Uaw</HI> 6, makes 21, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> 5, &s;umms in all 26.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> OUT of this Name the Cabali&s;tical Authors do form &s;everal Different Names, and all are in the &s;ame E&s;teem and Veneration among them, as the very Name <HI>Jehovah,</HI> and they are ve|ry cautious not to Reveal any of them to any Body, even of their own Nation, except it be to a Man accepted in General for a wi&s;e, pious, &s;ober, and blamele&s;s Per&s;on from his Infancy, according to the &s;trict Rules of Religion. Some of the diffe|rent &s;ort of Names are as follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE Name of 45 as they call it, which is formed thus, <HI>Bode Vau Dauleth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a Juleph, Vau Juleph Vau, Ea Juleph,</HI> The Numeration of &s;aid Letters together as they are wrote amounts to 45.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Name of 52 as they call it, which is formed thus, <HI>Yode Vau Dauleth, Ha Ha, Uau Uau, Ha Ha,</HI> following the &s;ame Rule, it amounts to the Number of 52. A great many more they do form, which I omit at pre&s;ent not being to my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> THEY have three different Ways of Numeration, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> they called <HI>Mi&s;paur
<PB N="21" REF="002324_0142_0FDB24E063C72E00">Grudol, a large Reckoning.</HI> The <HI>&s;econd <HI>Mi&s;paur Kautaun,</HI> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ort Recoming.</HI> The <HI>third <HI>Mi&s;paur Gmtzaugn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> a middle Reckoning,</HI> The fir&s;t is that Way which is mo&s;t common, <HI>i. e.</HI> from 1 to 9, from 10 to 90, and from 100 to 900. The &s;econd is that Way of Reckoning, which never ri&s;es higher than 9. <HI>e. g.</HI> from <HI>Juleph</HI> to <HI>Jeth</HI> is 9, and then begins again, from <HI>Yode</HI> to <HI>Tzadde</HI> is 9 al&s;o, and then again, from <HI>Kuph</HI> to <HI>Tzadde <HI>final,</HI></HI> makes 9 like|wi&s;e. The third is that in which the final Letters are not to be counted higher than their Equals, <HI>e. g. <HI>Cauph <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">auph</HI></HI> amounts to 20 each, and not 20 and 500, as the common Way is, and &s;o all the re&s;t of the double or final Letters follow the &s;ame Rule.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly and la&s;tly,</HI> AS they numerate by the Let|ters of the <HI>Alphabet,</HI> &s;o they do al&s;o by the Punct|ation of &s;aid Letters, and &s;o every Tittle or Point amounts to 10, the <HI>Pautauh</HI> to 6, and the <HI>Caumetz</HI> to 16. And when they want any Num|ber to make up the Sum of what they are a going to &s;hew or teach, &s;ometimes they make it up by the Number of Letters, &s;ometimes by the Number of Words, and &s;ometimes by both.</P>
<P>THESE Five Premi&s;es will be &s;ufficient at pre|&s;ent to make appear the Truth of what I am go|ing to a&s;&s;ert, even according to their Cabali&s;tical Principles.</P>
<P>NOW ob&s;erve, Our &s;overeign Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is called a <HI>Son,</HI> becau&s;e he is the true and beloved Son of the living God; him we are all obliged to obey, and follow his Laws and Directions, as in Mat. 17.5. <HI>And lo, a Voice from Heaven, &s;aying, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well plea&s;ed, hear ye him.</HI></P>
<P>THE more immediate Word for a Son in the O|riginal is <HI>Ben,</HI> this amounts according to the third Rule of Reckoning to 52, which is the &s;ame
<PB N="22" REF="002324_0143_0FDB24E1DE4A1AC8">Numeration of the Name <HI>Jehovah,</HI> as the &s;e|cond Way of Spelling of it. Again,</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is called <HI>Idam</HI> as the A|po&s;tle Paul &s;ays to the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 15.45. <HI>The fir&s;t Man Adam was made a living Soul, the last</HI> ADAM <HI>was made a quickning Spirit.</HI> Now the Word <HI>Idam</HI> following the &s;ame rule amounts to 45, and &s;o likewi&s;e the Name <HI>Jehovah</HI> according to the fir&s;t Way of Spelling of it amounts to 45. and &s;aid Name is called by them <HI>Idam</HI> al&s;o in &s;everal places of the Book <HI>Zohar</HI> afore&s;aid, p. 98. &amp; 117. (for Brevity &s;ake I omit the Words, but I am ready to &s;how hem at any Time when demanded of me.)</P>
<P>A great many My&s;teries and high Secrets the Ca|bali&s;tical <HI>Rabbies</HI> do pretend to know, and do de|clare they are included and Inclo&s;ed in this Name of 45. afore&s;aid, and altho' I am &s;ure they teach a great many Chimerical Notions, Neverthele&s;s, very often they &s;ay &s;omethings which are nothing but pure Chri&s;tianity, cloathed under different Terms, for want of the true Knowledge of the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel. One that ju&s;t now came into my mind I will Rehear&s;e, that &s;o the Truth of my A&s;&s;ertion, may be made to appear, and I am more free in tel|ling of it, becau&s;e it is very much to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THEY teach that God created the World with the Name of 45. and they prove it out of Prov. 3.19. <HI>The Lord by Wi&s;dom hath founded the Earth.</HI> The Word in the Original is <HI>Bahohmah,</HI> and they turn &s;aid Word, which is tran&s;lated, <HI>By Wi&s;dom,</HI> according to their way of explaining the mo&s;t part of the Scriptures, thus, <HI>Bahohmah Bacoauh Mau,</HI></P>
<P><HI>By Wi&s;dom, By the Strength of <HI>Mau</HI> i. e.</HI> by the Strength of the Name 45, &s;aying, <HI>The Lord by the Strength of this Name founded the Earth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="002324_0144_0FDB24E5CF955D58">
NOW I beg any to con&s;ider what Doctrine this is, but the &s;ame that is recorded in <HI>John,</HI> at the Beginning of his holy <HI>Evangelium,</HI> John 1.1, 2, 3. <HI>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; the &s;ame was in the beginning with God; all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.</HI></P>
<P>THIS WORD afore&s;aid is the true <HI><HI>Mau,</HI> i. e.</HI> the true <HI>Idam,</HI> which amounts to the Number of 45, as the Word <HI>Mau</HI> doth, which was from the Begin|ning, <HI>i. e.</HI> from Eternity with <HI>Jehovah the Lord,</HI> which amounts to 45 al&s;o, as afore&s;aid, to &s;how that the <HI>Son</HI> and the <HI>Father</HI> are all one, of the &s;elf &s;ame Numeration, <HI>i. e.</HI> of one and the &s;elf &s;ame E&s;&s;ence.</P>
<P>NOW, having found out that the two fir&s;t Per&s;ons of the Ble&s;&s;ed Trinity are included in the Name <HI>Jehovah,</HI> let us &s;ee whether we can find the third Per&s;on al&s;o.</P>
<P>THE third Per&s;on in the Hebrew is called <HI>Rooauh Eaukode&s;h.</HI> This Name amounts (accor|ding to the &s;econd way of Numeration, and the fifth, <HI>i. e.</HI> of the Punctation) to the Sum of 101. Now, take Notice, &s;ince the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> is neither made, created, nor ingendered of the Father or of the Son, but proceedeth from both, one and the &s;ame Sub&s;tance, &s;o likewi&s;e we &s;hall find his Name proceeds from them al&s;o, <HI>viz.</HI> The Name of God the Father, <HI>Jehovah,</HI> amounts to 26, according to the &s;econd Rule. <HI>Je&s;us Christ</HI> is called in Gen. 18.3. and more plainly in Mal. 3.1. <HI>Audonauy,</HI> which Name amounts to 65, by the fir&s;t Rule of Nume|ration. Both together makes 91, and with the Addition of the eight Letters of both Names, and the two Names them&s;elves, according to the fifth Rule, come to be in the whole 101 al&s;o, to &s;how that the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> proceedeth from both, <HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="002324_0145_0FDB24E78A5347B0">
AGAIN, The Name <HI>Roo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h,</HI> which &s;ignifies properly a <HI>Spirit,</HI> amounts (according to the &s;econd Rule of Numeration) to 16, and the Root of the Name <HI>Jehovah,</HI> which is <HI>Hauvau,</HI> amounts to 16 al&s;o, to &s;hew that the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> not only pro|ceeds from the <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Son,</HI> but even he is of the &s;ame Root and Sub&s;tance, or E&s;&s;ence as the Father is, <HI>i. e.</HI> equal in Power and Glory, from Everla&s;ting to Everla&s;ting. Moreover,</P>
<P>THE three afore&s;aid Lights commonly are cal|led by them <HI>Ketter Hohmah Beenau,</HI> and the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> they called <HI>Head, The Head of all things, The Head of all Heads, The inclo&s;ed of all Inclo&s;ures,</HI> &amp;c.

B.</HI>) of the&s;e Three Lights afore&s;aid, they explain the Text in Deut. 32.39. <HI>See now, that I, even I am he, and there is no God with me,</HI> as it is plainly to be &s;een in the Book <HI>Zohar</HI> afore|&s;aid, <HI>Page</HI> 22. The Truth of this Doctrine leads me to Think,</P>
<P>THAT when we read in the old Te&s;tament, that the Saints of old, as King <HI>David,</HI> &amp;c. did crave any Mercies or Favours of God <HI>for his NAME &s;ake,</HI> It was as much as if they had asked it in the Name of the whole TRINITY, becau&s;e in his Name <HI>Jehovah</HI> all the THREE Per&s;ons are inclu|ded, as I &s;aid; and therefore they were &s;ometimes an&s;wered, if the Thing by them de&s;ired, was ac|cording to his mo&s;t holy Will and Plea&s;ure, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, from what has been &s;aid, who&s;oever fears the Lord, or hath any regard for his Soul,
<PB N="25" REF="002324_0146_0FDB24E89F435B60">may ea&s;ily di&s;cern how great and high a Sin it is for any Body to be guilty of the Breach of the third Commandment, and likewi&s;e what is the Rea&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t who&s;oever takes the Name of the Lord in vain, HE will not hold him guiltle&s;s, but the Cur&s;e &s;hall fall upon him, and enter into the Hou&s;e of him that &s;weareth fal&s;ly his Name, and con&s;ume it, from the Timber even to the Stones thereof, <HI>Zech.</HI> 5.3.4.</P>
<P>MORE I might &s;ay to prove this Doctrine, even by the Authority of the Jewi&s;h Writers of this Science, not only upon <HI>Dent.</HI> 6.4. but upon &s;undry other Texts of the Scripture: But with what has been already &s;aid, I hope I have plainly and fully demon&s;trated, that the God which we adore and hope to be &s;aved by, is not <HI>three Gods,</HI> (God for|bid we &s;hould &s;ay &s;o,) but only One living and only true God; One in Sub&s;tance and E&s;&s;ence, but Three Per&s;ons, <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> all equal in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver and Glory from all Eternity.
