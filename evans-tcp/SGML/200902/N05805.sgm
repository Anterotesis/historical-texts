<P>MY con&s;tant Hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s, made it doubtful for &s;ome Time, whether, or not, I &s;hould comply with the Importunity of tho&s;e Friends who reque&s;ted this Publication: Which is the Rea&s;on why it was delayed.</P>
<P>BUT, when, on farther Reflection, I tho't it might be a Means of awakening in my Countrymen, &s;ome Sen&s;e of their Danger, and
<PB N="iv" REF="007373_0004_102B8B8631A53698">Duty, in this dark and critical Day, I readily con&s;ented.</P>
<P>FOR tho' this has been, and no doubt will &s;till be done in a better Manner, by tho&s;e who have more Lei&s;ure, and a further Acquaintance with our political Affairs; yet, as it appear'd of Importance, that the&s;e Things &s;hould be &s;et in various Lights, and made as public as po&s;&s;ible at &s;uch a Sea&s;on, when &s;o much depends on our being una|nimou&s;ly alarm'd, to the Defence of our Lives and Properties; I chearfully offer this Mite, &s;uch as it is, to the Abundance others are doing, towards &s;aving their Country from impending Ruin.</P>

<P>_WE have this Day, <HI>My Brethren, &s;anctified a Fa&s;t, called a &s;olemn A&s;&s;embly,</HI> to humble our&s;elves before God, for the crying Sins of the Times; to deprecate impending Judg|ments, and implore Direction and A&s;&s;i&s;tance from Heaven, again&s;t our <HI>Enemies,</HI> who, by their <HI>unrigh|teous Encroachments,</HI> on our Properties, and the <HI>Preparations</HI> they are making again&s;t us, &s;eem to threaten the Ruin of our Country.</P>
<P>I PRESUME, it will not be thought un&s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion, to give you &s;ome hi&s;torical and political Account, of the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Policy</HI> of our Enemies, and their wicked De&s;igns again&s;t us; that we may have a proper Sen&s;e of our Danger, and be excited to our Duty, in the pre&s;ent <HI>critical Juncture.</HI> To this Purpo&s;e, it will be proper we &s;hould look back to the Source and Spring of our pre&s;ent Troubles; which are well known to be the <HI>boundle&s;s Ambition</HI> of the late Kings of <HI>France,</HI> and their in&s;atiable <HI>Thir&s;t</HI> after arbitrary Power, and univer&s;al Monarchy.</P>
<P>WHOEVER con&s;iders, that <HI>France,</HI> from a &s;mall and incon&s;iderable Kingdom, in a few Centuries, is become one of the mo&s;t numerous and powerful in Europe, and by what <HI>arbitrary</HI> and <HI>unrighteous</HI> Methods, her Dominions have been extended; will be convinc'd, that all Encroach|ments

<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1431.</NOTE>. Their Territories &s;ince that Time, have been va&s;tly enlarged, and very much at the Expence of the <HI>ju&s;t Rights</HI> of their Neighbours; e&s;pecially by the pre&s;ent <HI>reigning Family,</HI> who are known by the Name of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon.</HI>&mdash;The fir&s;t indeed of this Race, <HI>Henry</HI> IVth, who came to the Throne 1589, while a Prote&s;tant, di&s;covered a very different Spirit, from his degenerate Offspring.&mdash;Tho', from Rea&s;ons of State, he was induced to declare him&s;elf a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> yet he had &s;o great a Regard to Ju&s;tice and Gratitude, as to e&s;tabli&s;h the famous <HI>Edict of</HI> Nantz
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">So called, becau&s;e publi&s;hed in that City, 1598.</NOTE>, in Favour of the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> who had advanced him to the Throne. This has done more Honour to his Memory, than all the warlike Exploits, whereby he acquir'd the Name of GREAT. But his Succe&s;&s;ors and Po&s;terity, the <HI>Lewis</HI>'s, have, for above one Hundred Years pa&s;t, been the <HI>Plague</HI> and <HI>Scourge</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> and rendered their Reigns infamous, by per&s;ecuting the Prote&s;tants, in Violation of the mo&s;t <HI>&s;olemn Engagements;</HI> whom <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIVth, in a Letter to <HI>Cromwel,</HI> acknowledged, were &s;ome of the be&s;t and mo&s;t peaceable Subjects he had.</P>

Here we may date the Beginning of <HI>arbitrary Power,</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> In this Reign al&s;o, her Territories were con&s;iderably enlarged, and the Foundation of her future <HI>Greatne&s;s</HI> and <HI>tyrannizing</HI> over her Neighbours, was then laid.</P>
<P>LEWIS XIVth, being in the 5th Year of his Age, at the Death of his Father, 1643, <HI>Cardinal Mazarine</HI> (equally noted for his Pride and Covetou&s;ne&s;s) was admitted into the Admini&s;tration, who effectually pro&s;ecuted the <HI>Plan</HI> laid by his Predece&s;&s;or; rendered the Crown wholly ab&s;olute; bereft the Subjects of the little Remains of Liberty; and upon them, and their Po&s;terity, rivetted the Chains of an abject <HI>Slavery.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Beginning of his Admini&s;tration, <HI>France</HI> made her&s;elf dreaded among her Neighbours, by a Series of Victories obtained in <HI>Flanders,</HI> again&s;t <HI>Spain,</HI> under the celebrated <HI>Prince of Conde,</HI> at a prodigious Expence of Blood. Tho', in the End, very little Advantage was derived from them, yet they &s;erved to &s;how how little Regard was had to the <HI>Lives</HI> of their Fellow-Creatures. Soon after, indeed, his proud De&s;igns, of extending the <HI>French</HI> Dominions, were, for a While ob&s;tructed, by the civil Broils and inte&s;tine Wars, which, at that Time, prevailed in the Nation: They al&s;o met with an effectual <HI>Check,</HI> for a Sea&s;on, by the Valour of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> under <HI>Cromwel,</HI> when Di&s;putes with <HI>France</HI> were ea&s;ily and &s;peedily &s;ettled, without any Blood&s;hed. Witne&s;s, that haughty Mini&s;ter's being obliged, by a <HI>&s;ingle Me&s;&s;age,</HI> contrary to his Intentions, to deliver up <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador

<P>No &s;ooner had <HI>Lewis</HI> XIVth taken the Reins of Go|vernment into his own Hands, than he acts the <HI>Tyrant</HI> over his own People, and di&s;covers his <HI>ambitious De&s;igns</HI> of en&s;laving the Re&s;t of <HI>Europe.</HI> Finding no better Pretence for falling on his Neighbours, he lays claim to <HI>Flanders,</HI> and <HI>Franch&eacute;-Comt&eacute;,</HI> by his Wife <HI>(Maria There&s;ia</HI> of <HI>Spain)</HI> tho' &s;he had expre&s;sly renounced all claim to it, on her Marriage; <HI>which,</HI> by a Series of <HI>bloody Battles</HI> and <HI>Sieges,</HI> at the Expence of Millions of <HI>Lives,</HI> he &s;ubdued: Tho' he was obliged to re&s;ign the latter; yet, at the Treaty of <HI>Aix-la-Chapelle</HI>
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1668.</NOTE>, he got confirmed to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> almo&s;t all the Places he had taken in <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>IN 1672, without the lea&s;t plau&s;ible Pretence for War, he makes the mo&s;t formidable Preparations, to &s;ubdue the <HI>United Netherlands,</HI> and wholly to extirpate the <HI>Dutch Common-Wealth.</HI> The <HI>States General,</HI> in a very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Manner, reque&s;ted that his Maje&s;ty would let them know, if tho&s;e <HI>mighty Preparations</HI> were de&s;igned again&s;t them: To whom that <HI>haughty Monarch</HI> made no other Reply, but, <Q>That he &s;hould employ his Troops in &s;uch a Manner, as his Dignity de&s;erved, which did not require him to give an Account to any one.</Q></P>
<P>ALL the Places that lay in his Way, fell an ea&s;y Prey to his victorious Arms. The Provinces of <HI>Utrecht, Overi&s;&s;el,</HI> and <HI>Guelders,</HI> with all the adjacent Places, being &s;ubdued, <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> the <HI>Metropolis,</HI> was ju&s;t on the Point of being &s;urrendered. So near and evident did their Ruin appear, that the mo&s;t noted Families, who were fond of their <HI>Liberties,</HI> had actually prepared for a Remove to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> chu&s;ing rather to live in the <HI>Extremities</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> than become the <HI>Slaves</HI> of a <HI>Tyrant.</HI> But divine Providence prevented their total Overthrow, which &s;eemed inevitable, by &s;undry favourable Interpo&s;itions.

<P>WE &s;hall not, I pre&s;ume, pretend that our pre&s;ent Secu|rity ari&s;es from our having &s;o much a <HI>greater</HI> Sen&s;e of Religion; Di&s;po&s;ition to acknowledge God, and depend upon him, than <HI>our Neighbours.</HI> Mu&s;t we not rather con|fe&s;s, it flows from the <HI>Want</HI> of a becoming Sen&s;ibility of the invaluable Privileges we enjoy, and of the Greatne&s;s of our Danger, tho' it be &s;o near and apparent.&mdash;But I tru&s;t, after all that has been &s;aid, to open our Eyes and alarm our Fears, we &s;hall not any longer fold our Hands together, and cry, <HI>A little more Sleep, and a little more Slum|ber.</HI> 'Tis <HI>high Time</HI> to look about us, and vigorou&s;ly fall upon every proper Method of Defence.</P>

WHAT a Pity, that at &s;uch a Time, there &s;hould be any <HI>Contention</HI> between our <HI>Governors,</HI> and re&s;pective <HI>A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> but who &s;hould be <HI>mo&s;t</HI> forward and zealous in the Service of their <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Country.</HI> All private and <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> De&s;igns; all petty Di&s;putes and Contentions, &s;hould be &s;wallowed up in a <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> View to, and Concern for, the public Good. Of what Importance is it, that our Repre&s;entatives &s;hould have <HI>enlarged Views,</HI> of the public Intere&s;t, and a <HI>deep Sen&s;e,</HI> how much the Welfare of their Country, depends upon <HI>their Conduct,</HI> in this difficult Day.&mdash;Nothing can be plainer, than that a <HI>par&s;imonious</HI> Spirit, at &s;uch a Time, opens a Door to the mo&s;t <HI>extravagant</HI> Expence. To do Things by <HI>Halves,</HI> is wor&s;e, than doing nothing at all. This we have learnt by fatal Experience. What &pound;. 10,000 would have done, when we <HI>fir&s;t</HI> had the Alarm, &pound;. 100,000, 'tis probable, will not <HI>now</HI> effect; and 'tis con&s;tantly <HI>increa&s;ing</HI> on our Hands, thro' the Vigilance, Activity, and continual Pre|parations of our Enemies. And &s;hould they by our Delays, and <HI>&s;tingy</HI> Provi&s;ions for Defence, thro' Fear of putting the Country to Charges, make it the Seat of a long di&s;tre&s;&s;ing War, there is no computing the Expence, and Number of Lives it may co&s;t. <HI>War</HI> is, indeed, to be deprecated; both Conquerors, and Conquered, are &s;ure to feel the &s;ad Effects of it, more or le&s;s; and <HI>Peace</HI> is &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing, that it is to be <HI>pur&s;ued</HI> by all ju&s;t and rational Methods. But the Way to have Peace in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, is to make a &s;peedy and vigorous Pre|paration for War: Had this been done more &s;ea&s;onably, it might have prevented all we now fear. There &s;eems but two po&s;&s;ible Ways left, to avoid the War we are threatned with from <HI>France.</HI> The one, tamely to <HI>&s;ubmit</HI> to their unrighteous Encroachments; quietly re&s;ign up our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and all our Privileges, into the Hands of a lawle&s;s Tyrant; and expo&s;e our&s;elves and Po&s;terity, to the mad Zeal and Fury, of cruel per&s;ecuting Bigots.&mdash; The other is, to let them &s;peedily know, that we have it in our Power to <HI>force</HI> them, to rea&s;onable Terms, and
<PB N="40" REF="007373_0040_102B8BCDC33430C0"><HI>oblige</HI> them to keep within their own Limits; and I need not &s;ay which, both Duty and Intere&s;t, lead us to take.</P>
<P>WERE the &s;everal Provinces thoroughly engaged, to take &s;ome &s;peedy, vigorous Steps, for the Protection and Defence of the Land, it might &s;trike &s;uch Dread into our Enemies, who&s;e In&s;olence and Courage, ari&s;e chiefly from our Sloth and Stupidity, as might divert the Storm that is now gathering fa&s;t upon us. And methinks we have every Thing to awaken our <HI>Fears,</HI> and animate our <HI>Hopes.</HI> On the one Hand, there is Poverty, Slavery, Per&s;ecution and Death; on the other, a fruitful Country, plea&s;ant Habitations, <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Liberty, and what is dearer than all, undefiled Chri&s;tianity. And do not let us put far away the evil Day. <HI>Delays</HI> may prove of the mo&s;t fatal Con|&s;equence; our Danger may be much <HI>nearer,</HI> and much <HI>greater</HI> than we imagine.</P>
<P>SHOULD the <HI>French,</HI> agreeable to their known Perfidy, before they declare War, &s;end a Fleet, with a large Army of well-di&s;ciplined Troops, to lay wa&s;te, and de&s;troy our Coa&s;ts; while the <HI>&s;avage Natives,</HI> who&s;e tender Mercies, are Cruelty, join them in falling on our <HI>Frontiers,</HI> what a a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Scene opens to our View? Our Sea-port <HI>Towns</HI> &s;ack'd, and laid in A&s;hes!&mdash;Our Country ravaged! our <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> plundered!&mdash;The Voice of Lamentation and Woe heard in our Streets!&mdash;Our <HI>Men</HI> &s;laughtered!&mdash;Our <HI>Wives</HI> and <HI>Daughters</HI> delivered to the Lu&s;ts and Fury of a lawle&s;s Soldiery!&mdash;Our helple&s;s <HI>Babes</HI> da&s;hed again&s;t the Stones!&mdash;Men looking on the right Hand for Help, and on the Left there is none to deliver! Their Hearts failing them for Fear, while they hear the confu&s;ed Noi&s;e of War; &s;ee Garments rolled in Blood, and the in&s;ulting Foe &s;preading De&s;olation and Ruin all around!&mdash;But I mu&s;t &s;top:&mdash;The <HI>tragical</HI> Scene is too di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, even in <HI>di&s;tant</HI> Pro&s;pect! And is there a <HI>emote Probability,</HI> is there <HI>appa|rent Danger,</HI> of our being thrown into &s;uch univer&s;al Tumult and Confu&s;ion and &s;hall we not <HI>exert</HI> our&s;elves, in making the mo&s;t &s;peedy and effectual Preparation again&s;t it? What Folly, what Madne&s;s; nay I may
<PB N="41" REF="007373_0041_102B8BCF4EB117D8">&s;ay, what <HI>Cruelty</HI> to our&s;elves and Po&s;terity, is it, to run the Ri&s;k of having De&s;olation, Angui&s;h and De&s;pair, &s;pread thro' the Land, by a &s;udden Inva&s;ion, while we are &s;o &s;hamefully unprepared, to make any proper Defence.</P>
<P>WE have every Thing to alarm, to rou&s;e and animate us, in &s;uch a Day as this, when all that is valuable, all that is dear, lies at Stake. Shall we tamely &s;uffer our delightful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to be taken from us?&mdash;become the Dupes and Slaves of a <HI>French</HI> Tyrant? What!&mdash;&s;acrifice our precious Liberty, our Property, and what is more, our Religion, to our Sloth? entail Mi&s;ery, Slavery, and Ruin, on our Po&s;terity, by our Indolence and Cowardice! God forbid! 'Tis high Time, to awake, to call up all the <HI>Briton</HI> in us, every Spark of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Valour; chearfully to offer our Pur&s;es, our Arms, and our Lives, to the Defence of our Country, our holy Religion, our excellent Con&s;titution, and invaluable Liberties. For what is Life, without <HI>Liberty?</HI> without the Enjoyment of the glorious <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of Chri&s;t, depending on the <HI>Will</HI> of a <HI>Tyrant</HI> and expo&s;ed to all the <HI>In&s;ults</HI> of per&s;ecuting <HI>Bigots?</HI> 'Tis not worth hav|ing. A <HI>free-born Briton,</HI> &s;hould di&s;dain the Life of a Slave;&mdash;better,&mdash;far better, bravely to <HI>&s;acrifice</HI> it to the Defence of our Religion and Country, than to <HI>&s;urvive</HI> the di&s;mal Day, when the&s;e Regions of Light and Liberty, &s;hall be over&s;pread with Ignorance, Super&s;tition, and Ty|ranny. And had we but the <HI>Spirit</HI> of our <HI>brave Ance&s;tors,</HI> who chearfully ventured their Lives, and re&s;igned all the Comforts thereof, in an howling Wilderne&s;s, that they might hand down to us the ine&s;timable Privileges we now enjoy: Were <HI>we,</HI> I &s;ay, animated with the &s;ame <HI>heroic</HI> Spirit, in the Defence of them; with the &s;ame ardent De|&s;ire of leaving them <HI>inviolate</HI> to our Po&s;terity;&mdash;did but the <HI>noble Ardor</HI> kindle from Brea&s;t to Brea&s;t, I doubt not, by the Smiles of Heaven, we &s;hould &s;oon make our Ene|mies flee before us, and again &s;it quietly under our Vines and Fig-trees, and eat the Good of the Land. <HI>Which God of his infinite Mercy grant,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
