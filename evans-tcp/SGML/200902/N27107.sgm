<HEAD>2. SAMUEL, xii. 7. AND NATHAN SAID TO DAVID, THOU ART THE MAN.</HEAD>
<P>NEVER, perhaps, had one man a more &s;olemn me&s;|&s;age to deliver to another than Nathan had to David in this in&s;tance.</P>
<P>Although David was a man after God's own heart, and divinely appointed king over his people Israel, yet, we may venture to a&s;&s;ert, of none are &s;uch &s;hocking ini|quities left on &s;acred record, as of him. This while it affords a warning for the righteous in every age, does not in the lea&s;t excu&s;e them, when found guilty.</P>
<P>In the in&s;tance before us, David had mo&s;t unlawfully taken the wife of Uriah, and becau&s;e he could not con|ceal his guilt, had cau&s;ed him to be put to death. Thus murder and adultery became the crimes with which he was chargeable.&mdash;The&s;e aggravated crimes were bighly provoking to the God of holine&s;s. He beheld them with indignation. Nathan, therefore, is divinely commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;ound in the ears of David an alarming report, that he may be awakened hereby to confe&s;&s;ion and repentance; for he was now, it appears, &s;leeping in his iniquity.&mdash;Nathan, in&s;tructed of God, went well furni&s;hed to per|form his errand. He knew how to take the wife in their own craftine&s;s: as mu&s;t be fully evident, when we look into the &s;ermon which he preached to his royal heater
<PB N="6" REF="036116_0004_1007E7F22D841598">and con&s;ider his application, which naturally follows. <HI>And the Lord &s;ent Nathan unto David; and be came unto him, and &s;aid unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich and the other poor. The rich man had exceed|ing many flocks and herds: But the poor man had nothing face one little ewe-lamb, which he had bought and nouri&s;hed up: and it grew up together with him and with his children: in did eat of his own meat, and drink of his own cup, and lay in his bo&s;om, and was unto him as a daughter. And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and be &s;pared to take of his own flock, and of his own herd, to dre&s;s for the way-fairing man that was come unto him, but took the poor man's lamb, and dre&s;&s;ed if for the man that was come to him.</HI></P>
<P>When Nathan had thus uttered the body of his di&s;|cour&s;e, it &s;eems, he made &s;ome pau&s;e; gave David an opportunity to reply; and, perhaps, he thought that a per&s;on of &s;uch di&s;cernment would at once &s;ee his inten|tion, and there would be no nece&s;&s;ity that he &s;hould be more particular or pointed.&mdash;But alas! the deceitful, the infatuating nature of &s;in!&mdash;David, with all his wi&s;dom did not, at this time, know him&s;elf. He readily &s;aw the horrid crime of the rich man in Nathan's parable, and deeply in|cen&s;ed at it, denounced again&s;t him immediate and inevita|ble death: but he &s;aw not him&s;elf involved in this de&s;crip|tion. His mind was &s;adly blinded. The prophet, there|fore, was put to the painful nece&s;&s;ity of applying his di&s;|cour&s;e <HI>plainly,</HI> otherwi&s;e it was likely to have no good ef|fect.&mdash;<HI>Thou art the man,</HI> &s;aid Nathan who hath done this. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord God of I&s;rael, I anointed thee king over I&s;rael, and I delivered thee out of the bands of Saul: And I gave thee thy ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, and thy ma&s;ter's, wives into thy bo&s;om, and gave thee the hou&s;e of I&s;rael and of Ju|dah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee &s;uch and &s;uch things. Wherefore ha&s;t thou de&s;pi&s;ed the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his &s;ight? thou ha&s;t killed Uriah the Hittite, and ha&s;t taken his wite to be thy wife. Now therefore the &s;word &s;hall never depart from thy hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="036116_0005_10081B1056AB3130">
Nathan having told him his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion in this <HI>plain</HI> manner, and the puni&s;hment he was doomed to &s;uffer becau&s;e of it, <HI>David &s;aid, I have finned again&s;t the Lord.</HI> He freely acknowledged his guilt, and was ready to take to him&s;elf the condemnation of death.</P>
<P>The text and context thus viewed will naturally fur|ni&s;h us with the following leading propo&s;ition, as the &s;ub|ject of di&s;cour&s;e on this occa&s;ion, viz.</P>
<P>That &s;uch is the moral blindne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility of men, that it is nece&s;&s;ary for mini&s;ters to u&s;e great <HI>plainne&s;s</HI> in delivering to them the go&s;pel-me&s;&s;age with any good pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;peaker would remark, that he is far from pre&s;um|ing to dictate a mode of preaching to his fathers, and brethren in the mini&s;try. It is his wi&s;h and aim only to offer his own opinion with freedom and candour upon a &s;ubject of the la&s;t importance; a &s;ubject which &s;o nearly cencerns the everla&s;ting weal or woe of the &s;ouls of men. This, he flatters him&s;elf, will be di&s;agreeable to none, who has the lea&s;t &s;incere de&s;ire of turning many to right|eou&s;ne&s;s, and thus of &s;hining forever as di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;tars in the firmament of divine glory.</P>
<P>To proceed, then, according to the propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Men are prone to look upon their own character with a partial eye, and to think of them&s;elves more highly than they ought to think. They quickly perceive when oth|ers do ami&s;s, but in re&s;pect to them&s;elves they have little or no di&s;cerning. They &s;ee not their own picture, when clearly and fully drawn to their view; and will not think it re&s;embles them, unle&s;s po&s;itively told it does in the plaine&s;t terms. So unwilling are they to think their own conduct wrong, that when it is painted before them in the mo&s;t &s;triking light, they are ready to apply it to oth|ers; and ha&s;tily condemn <HI>them</HI> while them&s;elves are the per&s;ons criminal. Thus in&s;tead of con&s;idering that a <HI>beam is in their own eye,</HI> they would fain di&s;cover a <HI>mote in the eye of their brother.</HI> Such is naturally the di&s;po&s;i|tion of mankind, and &s;uch the turn which &s;in has given to the human mind. Experience and ob&s;ervation mu&s;t have
<PB N="8" REF="036116_0006_10081B11D8A11D60">&s;hewn us all the truth of the&s;e remarks; and &s;cripture examples fully confirm them. The ca&s;e of David ju&s;t noticed, &s;eems &s;ufficient for this, even did the Bible con|tain nothing more of a &s;imilar nature.</P>
<P>David, we have every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, was a man of no common or inferior abilities. Without doubt his pen|etrating judgment, his clearne&s;s of perception, and wi&s;dom of di&s;cernment were far above the level of men in gene|ral: This we mu&s;t conclude from his advanced &s;tation, and the many advantages attending it. Add to all the&s;e the &s;pecial grace of God, with which his mind was richly furni&s;hed. Under all the&s;e &s;uperior endowments and ad|vantages, David mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a per&s;on eminent|ly qualified to hear divine truth, and make right applica|tion of it. And one would have thought, that a word to a per&s;on of his talents would be &s;ufficient;&mdash;that a mere hint would an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. But it was found quite the rever&s;e. He had fooli&s;hly for&s;aken God, and was left to &s;ink in the mire of his own guilty pollution. His con&s;cience was at this time put to &s;ilence, and the gra|cious principle within him was &s;tifled. He had left his great Head; his &s;trength was con&s;equently gone; and he was like other men, &s;ave only that his &s;uperior judg|ment and under&s;tanding remained. This evidently ap|pears to have been his melancholy &s;ituation, when Nathan came to him; for otherwi&s;e, how could he be &s;o in&s;en&s;i|ble to his aggravated impiety! The prophet finding his condition to be &s;uch, was inclined to catch him, as it were, with guile. He knew him to be &s;till capable of judging between right and wrong, although &s;o blinded re&s;pect|ing him&s;elf; he therefore related his conduct in the per|&s;on of another. He told him of a man who had done thus and &s;o. David immediately discovered the wicked|ne&s;s of this man's deed, and declared what his fate &s;hould be.</P>
<P>Now had Nathan left the matter here; had he gone his way and &s;aid no more; we cannot &s;ee that what he had already &s;aid would have been of much benefit to his bearer, for his meaning was not taken. The per&s;on to
<PB N="9" REF="036116_0007_1007E7F6DA911238">whom he &s;pake was &s;till in darkne&s;s as to his own &s;tate. But Nathan did not mean to leave him &s;o. He was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">nt to be an in&s;trument for awakening him from his &s;tupor, and he intended that nothing &s;hould fail through his un|faithfulne&s;s. When, therefore, he &s;aw that the parable in it&s;elf had not the de&s;ited effect, he explained and ap|plied it. He told David that be was the per&s;on who had done thus wickedly; and laid before him a particular &s;tatement of the crimes which he had committed, and the circum&s;tances which rendered thein &s;ingularly heinous. This plain dealing, the&s;e home truths made him tentibly &s;eel their &s;orce. And what was the con&s;equence? He began to come to him&s;elf. He found where he was. His guilt &s;tared him in the face. He &s;aw him&s;elf condemned out of his own mouth. In no way could he ju&s;tify him|&s;elf. Indeed, he had no di&s;po&s;ition to attempt this. Na|than had &s;tated facts &s;o clearly and pungently, that con|viction at once &s;la&s;hed upon his mind. He confe&s;&s;ed his &s;in before the Lord. And from what the prophet after|wards &s;aid to him, it appears, he was willing to abide the &s;entence which he had uttered again&s;t one of his charac|ter. But Nathan told him he &s;hould not die, for the Lord had put away his &s;in; and declared what judgments &s;hould come upon him, and upon his family, for his ini|quity.</P>
<P>What could more directly prove the truth of the prop|o&s;ition before us than the things now mentioned? If the renowned king of I&s;rael, a man greatly favoured of God, with all his &s;agacity, mu&s;t have truths clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed to his con&s;cience, in order to find them applicable to him|&s;elf, and in order to his being profited by them; then we may, it is thought, &s;afely conclude that the &s;ame is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for all hearers of the go&s;pel now. Nathan might have repeated parable after parable to David, but it does not appear that they would have been of any real advan|tage to him, unle&s;s he had &s;aid, <HI>Thou art the man.</HI> This plain &s;entence &s;truck him more powerfully than all things el&s;e which he &s;aid. So mini&s;ters may de&s;cribe the <HI>general</HI> character of wicked men once and again, but unle&s;s they
<PB N="10" REF="036116_0008_10081B135A99DC38">take &s;ome method to let their hearers know that <HI>they</HI> are <HI>these</HI> wicked per&s;ons, and &s;how in what their wickedne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, it will not be likely to profit them, or effectually impre&s;s their minds. They will be inclined to apply the de&s;cription to others, in&s;tead of taking it to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The &s;peaker would not be under&s;tood here as in the lea&s;t in&s;inuating, that mini&s;ters <HI>are &s;ufficient of them&s;elves</HI> to &s;ay <HI>any thing as of them&s;elves</HI> which &s;hall be &s;avingly profitable to their hearers. All their <HI>&s;ufficiency is of God.</HI> His Spirit alone can crown their labours with &s;ucce&s;s. But this can in no degree le&s;&s;en their &s;olemn obligations to faithfulne&s;s and plaine&s;s in warning their people, by declaring to them their &s;infulne&s;s, and what mu&s;t await them without repentance. For unle&s;s they are thus faithful and plain in their addre&s;&s;es, they can have no ground for expecting the Sprit's influence to accompany their endeavors; nor will what they deliver have a tendency to affect the heart, but will leave it in&s;en&s;ible as before.</P>
<P>That men are by nature morally blind and in&s;en&s;ible the &s;cripture<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> of truth are full in declaring. As a full demon&s;tration of this, we need only hear it &s;aid of them, that they <HI>have the under&s;tanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becau&s;e of the blindne&s;s of their heart: being pa&s;t feeling:</HI> And that <HI>they &s;eeing, &s;ee not: and hearing, they hear not, neither do they under&s;tand. They are &s;otti&s;h children, and they have none under&s;tanding: they are wi&s;e to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge. The ox knoweth his owner, and the a&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> his ma&s;ter's crib: but I&s;rael doth not know, m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> people doth not con&s;ider.</HI></P>
<P>That becau&s;e of this moral blindne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility of men great plaine&s;s is to be u&s;ed in delivering to them the go&s;pel-me&s;&s;age, is no le&s;s a dictate of <HI>rea&s;on</HI> than of <HI>revelation.</HI> It is obvious, that blind per&s;ons mu&s;t have plan and particular de&s;criptions, or they will not under|&s;tand; and per&s;ons in&s;en&s;ible to a great degree mu&s;t have direct and pointed things, or they will not feel. But let us recur <HI>to the law and to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> The precepts and examples of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> are binding. The divine com|mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="11" REF="036116_0009_10081B153767F5C0">to I&s;aiah was, <HI>Cry aloud, &s;pare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and &s;hew my people them tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and the hou&s;e of I&s;rael their &s;ins:</HI> that is, de&s;cribe their tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions &s;o clearly and fully as that they cannot but &s;ee them. <HI>Spare not</HI> through fear or favor. The me&s;&s;age from God to Ezekiel was, <HI>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the hou&s;e of I&s;rael: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. When I &s;ay unto the wick|ed, thou &s;hall &s;urely die; and thou give&s;t him not warning, nor &s;peake&s;t to warn the wicked from his wicked way to &s;ave his life: the &s;ame wicked man &s;hall die in his iniquity: but his blood will I require at thine hand.</HI> Mo&s;t weighty was the motive here held before the prophet for being plain and pungent in addre&s;&s;ing the people of his charge. It is recorded of the people in I&s;aiah's time, that they <HI>&s;aid to the &s;eers &s;ee not: and to the prophets, prophecy not unto us right things, &s;peak unto us &s;mooth things, prophecy deceits.</HI> It is evident, that this blind and in&s;en&s;ible people wi&s;hed not to have plain and pointed things told them, le&s;t they &s;hould be con&s;trained to &s;ee and feel: they therefore de|&s;ired the prophets to go directly a&s;ide from their duty. In the Apo&s;tle Peter we have a direct example of plain|ne&s;s in preaching and the happy effects of it. <HI>Ye men of I&s;rael,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>hear the&s;e words: Je&s;us of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by miracles, and wonders, and &s;igns, which God did by him in the mid&s;t of you, as your&s;elves al&s;o know: Him, being delivered by the determinate coun&s;el and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands crucified and &s;lain.&mdash;Know a&s;&s;uredly, that God hath made that &s;ame Je&s;us whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Chri&s;t. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and &s;aid unto Peter, and to the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles, men and brethren, what &s;hall we do? Then Peter &s;aid unto them, repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> And we find, that they did repent, and were &s;avingly converted, to the number of three thou&s;and.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="036116_0010_10081B185A833B40">
We may next come to the perfect examplar of all.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t, who mu&s;t be acknowledged the &s;tandard of preach|ing, and the great pattern for all who publi&s;h his go&s;pel, &s;pake to his hearers in the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t direct terms. His admirable &s;ermon upon the mount was clo&s;e and &s;earch|ing, aimed directly at the heart, and excellently adapted to expo&s;e its hidden iniquity. It &s;hows clearly and fully the in&s;ufficiency of all outward forms and rites in religion, while inward, vital piety, is neglected; and thus it was directly &s;uited to detect the characters and conduct of the &s;elf-approving Phari&s;ees, who regarded only the externals of divine wor&s;hip. The hypocri&s;y, the worldly-minded|ne&s;s, the ra&s;h and cen&s;orious &s;pirit, of many of his audi|ence are pointedly &s;poken again&s;t in this &s;ermon of Je&s;us. When he was preaching to &s;ome who <HI>tru&s;ted in them&s;elves, that they were righteous, and de&s;pi&s;ed others,</HI> he delivered the parable of the Phari&s;ee and Publican; than which nothing could be better calculated to humble their pride and &s;elf-conceit. Chri&s;t not only gave a general de&s;crip|tion of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, when he preached to them, but expre&s;sly and repeatedly &s;aid to them, <HI>Ye fools and blind: and wo unto you ye blind guides:</HI> and he plain|ly told them wherefore he denounced this woe. Having uttered &s;omething which his di&s;ciples wi&s;hed him to ex|plain, he &s;aid unto them, <HI>Are ye al&s;o yet without under&s;tand|ing?</HI> Although he had a tender regard for Martha, yet when &s;he complained to him of her &s;i&s;ter, he utters this &s;harp rebuke, <HI>Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things.</HI> Hence, it appears, that the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, as well as others, mu&s;t have great plainne&s;s u&s;ed with them, or <HI>he</HI> would not in his preaching have dealt &s;o plainly. He perfectly knew what was nece&s;&s;ary and be&s;t on all occa&s;ions. He knew, that however wi&s;e men might be re&s;pecting things of this world, yet in things of a truly religious nature, they were but mere fools. He there|fore called them &s;o. <HI>O fools, and &s;low of heart,</HI> &s;aid he to the two di&s;ciples, <HI>to believe all that the prophets have &s;poken.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;aid of Chri&s;t as a preacher, that <HI>he &s;pake as one having authority.</HI> He &s;poke at once to the con&s;ciences of
<PB N="13" REF="036116_0011_1007E7F896E38328">them who heard him: accordingly, it is &s;aid of &s;ome to whom he &s;pake, that <HI>being convinced by their own con&s;cience, they went out one by one, beginning at the elde&s;t, even unto the la&s;t.</HI> He told his hearers their wickedne&s;s without any re&s;erve, and the puni&s;hment it merited. He de&s;crib|ed their different characters &s;o ju&s;tly and particularly, that each individual mu&s;t &s;ee him&s;elf intended in the de&s;crip|tion, and mu&s;t know whether he belonged to the cla&s;s of &s;aints or to the cla&s;s of &s;inners. He addre&s;&s;ed all accord|ing to their various conditions. To hardened &s;inners he was a <HI>&s;on of thunder.</HI> His language to the&s;e was,&mdash;<HI>Fill ye up the mea&s;ure of your fathers. Ye &s;erpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye e&s;cape the damnation of hell?</HI> To &s;inners &s;eriou&s;ly awakened he was a <HI>&s;on of con&s;olation.</HI> To &s;uch he &s;pake in loving accents: <HI>Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t. Him that cometh to me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</HI> To his true follow|ers his &s;peech was graciou&s;ly kind and conde&s;cending, when he found them walking in the truth: <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are ye, when men &s;hall revile you, and per&s;ecute you, and &s;hall &s;ay all manner of evil again&s;t you fal&s;ely for my &s;ake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven.</HI> In a word; &s;o particular was Chri&s;t to the &s;everal &s;orts of per&s;ons that compo&s;ed his auditory, that a <HI>Thou art the man</HI> came home to the bo&s;om of each of them. He meant to exhibit divine truth &s;o clearly and di&s;tinctly, that by the light of it all &s;hould di&s;cover their true &s;itua|tion. And in this he hath left an example for all who go out in his name.</P>
<P>A number of INFERENCES, Sugge&s;ted by the &s;ubject, &s;hall now be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a plain inference from the &s;ubject, that mini&s;|ters <HI>ought</HI> to be particular and direct in addre&s;&s;ing their hearers, or in applying to them the truths they deliver. If Nathan did no more than his duty in &s;aying to David,
<PB N="14" REF="036116_0012_10081B19DDD7B5A0"><HI>Thou art the man:</HI> thou ha&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed in &s;o many in|&s;tances, and <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed the commandment of the Lord: thou ha&s;t killed Uriah,</HI> &amp;c.

They may and ought, as the foundation of their di&s;cour&s;es, to ex|plain and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome doctrinal truths. This they may do from the example of Nathan who fir&s;t delivered a par|able to prepare the way for what followed. But like him, they mu&s;t in the improvement &s;uitably apply the&s;e truths to all pre&s;ent, that they may find them&s;elves concerned in them, and that they were de&s;igned for their benefit. They &s;hould be &s;o explicit and &s;earching in the applica|tion, as to make it amount to the words of the text.</P>
<P N="2">2. From the view ju&s;t taken, in connection with the &s;ubject at large, may be inferred a good, and, perhaps, the be&s;t method of preaching. Nathan did not in the very beginning of his di&s;cour&s;e, as the fir&s;t &s;alutation, &s;ay to David&mdash;<HI>Thou art the man.</HI> Had he done <HI>this,</HI> it might have greatly provoked the royal per&s;onage. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the king would have given a favorable reception to &s;uch home-language <HI>immediately</HI> advanced, before any thing had been &s;aid which might introduce it. The prophet, it &s;eems, was aware of this. He therefore, like a wi&s;e preacher, fir&s;t aimed in his di&s;cour&s;e to prepare the mind of his hearer for receiving truth. He repre|&s;ented his conduct by a plain &s;imilitude. The flagrant inju&s;tice and cruelty of the conduct thus repre&s;ented, Da|vid could not but at once condemn. Nathan knew he had now only to apply the &s;imilitude, and his point was gained. This he could ea&s;ily do, for he had only to let David &s;ee, that his own conduct was like that which he had condemned, and the work was done. So if go&s;pel preachers would be in the way mo&s;t effectual for bring|ing their hearers to feel, acknowledge and embrace the
<PB N="15" REF="036116_0013_1007E7FEA0FCA808">truth, let them not <HI>immediately</HI> and directly de&s;cribe their wickedne&s;s with all its aggravations. This will be likely to irritate rather than profit. Let them fir&s;t give &s;uch a general and plain de&s;cription of moral conduct as &s;hall be &s;uited to convince the con&s;ciences of all re&s;pecting what is &s;in and what is holine&s;s. And when the con&s;cience is thus convinced, and brought to own and receive general truths, it cannot con&s;i&s;tently but own and receive partic|ular truths contained in, and inferred from them. When mini&s;ters &s;o adapt the body of their di&s;cour&s;es, as that the people, while they do not &s;ee them&s;elves intended, are con&s;trained to acknowledge and approve what is morally right, and cen&s;ure what is morally wrong; the applica|tion becomes forcible and irre&s;i&s;table. The hearers find them&s;elves condemned of their own con&s;ciences, and are obliged inwardly to confe&s;s their guilty de&s;erts.</P>
<P>This view is &s;uited to reprove, on the one hand, tho&s;e &s;ermons which are <HI>direct</HI> and <HI>pointed</HI> from beginning to end, and which in&s;tead of <HI>benefiting,</HI> needle&s;sly <HI>offend</HI> and prejudice the mind again&s;t the truth; and on the other hand, it is &s;uited to reprove tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es which are <HI>general</HI> throughout, and which come not <HI>near</HI> the hearers, but &s;uffer them to <HI>feel</HI> and <HI>think</HI> as if they were not in the lea&s;t concerned in what had been &s;aid. This is going to either extreme, while the medium is to be cho&s;en. The <HI>parable</HI> and the <HI>Thou art the man,</HI> make a good compo&s;i|tion for a profitable &s;ermon, while either alone will be found wanting.</P>
<P N="3">3. We infer from what has been &s;aid, that if it be the duty of Mini&s;ters to be particular and direct in applying the truths they deliver, then &s;urely it is the duty of hear|ers candidly to receive the&s;e truths, and not take unrea|&s;onable offence becau&s;e of their plainne&s;s. We are not told that David was offended becau&s;e Nathan u&s;ed with him &s;uch great plainne&s;s. No: he received it cordially: he felt its force; and freely confe&s;&s;ed the ju&s;tne&s;s of the charge brought again&s;t him. In this he is a pattern for all who hear the word preached in its power and pungen|cy. They &s;hould hear it with meekne&s;s, knowing that
<PB N="16" REF="036116_0014_10081B1B6250BAA0">it may become the means of &s;aving their &s;ouls, if they do not wilfully reject it. It is a &s;ad mark indeed, when peo|ple wi&s;h to hear <HI>&s;mooth things</HI> to be <HI>daubed with untempered mortar:</HI> and are oppo&s;ed to &s;earching go&s;pel-truths. This was the character of mo&s;t of the Jews in the time of Chri&s;t. <HI>He</HI> was too penetrating for them: <HI>his</HI> words <HI>pierced</HI> like &s;words. <HI>Ye,</HI> &s;aid he to them, <HI>are of your fath|er the devil, and the lu&s;ts of your father ye will do. And be|cau&s;e I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. He that is of God beareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, be|cau&s;e ye are not of God.</HI> Thus clo&s;ely did Chri&s;t addre&s;s them. But in&s;tead of receiving it calmly, and owning it altogether ju&s;t, they replied, <HI>&s;ay we not well, that thou art a Samaritan, and ba&s;t a devil?</HI> They were ignorant and blind in re&s;pect to &s;piritual things; and were di&s;po&s;ed to cavil at, and reject the mo&s;t precious and intere&s;ting truths. The&s;e Jews were mo&s;t unrea&s;onable and wicked in this re&s;pect. Their conduct was directly the rever&s;e from what it ought to have been. They oppo&s;ed the on|ly Saviour, and injured their own &s;ouls. And mo&s;t ar|dently could it be wi&s;hed that none might imitate them at the pre&s;ent day. It is undeniably the duty of Mini&s;|ters to be di&s;criminating and &s;earching. This is evident from what has been &s;aid, that they can have no good pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, unle&s;s they are. And that they may be &s;ucce&s;sful, &s;hould be the earne&s;t de&s;ire of <HI>them</HI> and of <HI>all.</HI> If <HI>this,</HI> then, be the incumbent and indi&s;pen&s;ible du|ty of Mini&s;ters, it mu&s;t of cour&s;e be the incumbent and indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of hearers to receive bible-truths in the love of them, however much they may expo&s;e their wick|edne&s;s. Had David been angry with the prophet, and greatly oppo&s;ed his plain me&s;&s;age, how would he have ad|ded &s;in to &s;in, and brought tenfold more guilt upon his own &s;oul. But he was far from this: His con&s;cience &s;mote him, and he owned the fact. Thus &s;hould all do, when they hear truths applicable to them&s;elves. But as God formerly &s;aid to his prophet Ezekiel, &s;o is he now &s;aying to his Mini&s;ters, <HI>Thou &s;halt &s;peak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are mo&s;t rebellious.</HI></P>

4. We infer from the &s;ubject, that we have great cau&s;e to lament that men are <HI>&s;o</HI> blind and in&s;en&s;ible in things which pertain to godline&s;s, as to <HI>need</HI> &s;uch plainne&s;s,&mdash;&s;uch clo&s;e application of go&s;pel-truths, in order to &s;ee their own picture. It is the <HI>character,</HI> the moral blindne&s;s and weakne&s;s of men, which makes plain and pointed truths &s;o <HI>nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> Had I&s;rael's king taken the meaning of Nathan, after he had &s;poken the parable; applied it to him&s;elf; appeared penitent; and acknowledged his &s;ev|eral in&s;tances of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; the prophet would not have been con&s;tained to &s;ay to him as in the text: he would have found no <HI>need</HI> for this. But when he had told him the &s;tory of the poor and rich man; as David continued &s;till in&s;en&s;ible re&s;pecting him&s;elf, what mu&s;t the prophet do? He was &s;ent to him for <HI>good,</HI> and he wi&s;hed to be in&s;trumental of doing <HI>this.</HI> But how &s;hall he come to the king's heart? for unle&s;s he does this, he is not likely to benefit him. He would gladly u&s;e delicacy and tenderne&s;s with a per&s;on of &s;uch exalted office and rank. He wi&s;hes not to be thought too ra&s;h or &s;evere, if mild mea&s;ures will an&s;wer. He &s;eems de&s;irous that he may take the <HI>hint,</HI> may &s;ee and repent of his error; with|out being told how bad he is in the <HI>plaine&s;t</HI> terms po&s;&s;ible. But <HI>all</HI> will not do. Nathan is brought to &s;ee, that he mu&s;t either leave his mind <HI>unimpre&s;&s;ed</HI> with a &s;en&s;e of his condition, or declare to him his meaning freely and fully without the lea&s;t paliation. This no doubt was a di&s;a|greeable dilemma. But he knew he mu&s;t perform the mi&s;&s;ion he had received from God. He cho&s;e to be a faithful &s;ervant of his great Ma&s;ter, and &s;ubmit the event to him. Alas! David, how great mu&s;t be thy &s;tupidity at this time, that nothing will bring thee to thy right &s;en&s;es but a <HI>Thou art the man!</HI> As the conduct of Da|vid, and his in&s;en&s;ibility re&s;pecting it, <HI>obliged</HI> Nathan to preach thus clo&s;ely, &s;o the conduct and in&s;en&s;ibility of nearers in general <HI>now</HI> mu&s;t <HI>oblige</HI> preachers to do the &s;ame. As David was quick to di&s;cern and cen&s;ure the &s;infulne&s;s of another, without con&s;idering his own; &s;o mo&s;t hearers can quickly &s;ee the faults of others, and what
<PB N="18" REF="036116_0016_10081B1F3A4CBE60">truths belong to them, while <HI>them&s;elves</HI> are <HI>clear,</HI> and no part of the di&s;cour&s;e &s;uits their own ca&s;e. This obliges Mini&s;ters to &s;ay in effect, you are the per&s;ons meant, you are the guilty. <HI>Obliges,</HI> did I &s;ay? Yes; a &s;en&s;e of du|ty obliges them to this. For it is no agreeable thing in it&s;elf to tell &s;inners without re&s;erve what is their charac|ter. But <HI>this</HI> mu&s;t be done. And it is truly to be la|mented, that it is with &s;uch difficulty the mind of man is brought to look in upon it&s;elf, and &s;ee its condition: &mdash;that all can &s;o ha&s;tily condemn others for that which they allow in them&s;elves, and di&s;cover the failings of oth|ers &s;o much &s;ooner than their own.</P>
<P N="5">5. We may infer from the &s;ubject what is the great <HI>de&s;ign</HI> of the Go&s;pel-mini&s;try. It is to awaken &s;inners to a &s;en&s;e of their iniquities, and bring them to <HI>repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Agree|ably we find Paul commi&s;&s;ioned to the Gentiles for this important end, <HI>To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of &s;atan unto God, that they may receive forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, and inheritance among them which are &s;anctified by faith that is in me.</HI> From this it is evident, that moral blindne&s;s is removed; &s;aving conviction excited; &s;piritual freedom effected; and re|generation accompli&s;hed, through the in&s;trumentality of Go&s;pel-preaching. All men by nature, or in their un|&s;anctified condition, are as in&s;en&s;ible to their true charac|ter and ill-de&s;erts as tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the divine law, as Da|vid was to <HI>his,</HI> when the prophet approached him. They <HI>di&s;cern not the things of the Spirit of God.</HI> And as the Lord &s;ent Nathan to David for the expre&s;s de&s;ign of con|vincing and converting him; &s;o <HI>He</HI> rai&s;es up, qualifies, and &s;ends his Mini&s;ters to be amba&s;&s;adors for him, and in&s;trumental in the conviction and conver&s;ion of &s;inful men. The mini&s;try of the word is de&s;igned in the hand of the Holy Spirit to <HI>enlighten</HI> the minds of men, that they may &s;ee that they have &s;inned, and what they de&s;erve as &s;inners, and in this way become truly penitent and re|formed.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="036116_0017_10081B245397EA38">
Deeply impre&s;&s;ed by this momentous de&s;ign of their mi&s;&s;ion, how careful, how anxiou&s;ly concerned &s;hould Mini&s;ters be, that they be found faithful me&s;&s;engers; that they fulfil the mini&s;try which they have received of the Lord! What diligent heed ought they to take, that the de&s;ign of their me&s;&s;age may not fail by their means! Are they &s;ent <HI>to warn the wicked of his wicked way, that he turn from it?</HI> let them do it faithfully and plainly, that they may deliver their own &s;ouls; and that the <HI>blood of him who dieth in his iniquity may not be required at their hand.</HI></P>
<P>Let them fully de&s;cribe the &s;tate and danger of &s;inners, and like Nathan, apply the de&s;cription to the hearts of their hearers with the greate&s;t plainne&s;s.

<P>My <HI>Friend</HI> and <HI>Brother</HI> will &s;uffer me a word at this &s;erious moment.</P>
<P>It is pre&s;umed, <HI>Dear Sir,</HI> that you have cordially ac|quie&s;ced in the leading &s;entiments, which have now been advanced.

As you de&s;ire, therefore, to &s;ucceed in your Ma&s;ter's work, you will aim plainly and faithfully to declare his me&s;&s;age; directly applying the truths you deliver to the ca&s;es of all who hear them. For doing <HI>this,</HI> you have the Prophets, the Apo&s;tles, and Chri&s;t him&s;elf, as examples.

<P>Accept our &s;incere congratulations on the re-&s;ettle|ment of the Go&s;pel-mini&s;try among you. Receive the man of your choice as a prophet &s;ent you from the Lord. Con&s;ider him as having a mi&s;&s;ion from his divine Ma&s;ter which he is bound to di&s;charge: And while his wi&s;dom and prudence &s;hall direct him in the faithful di&s;charge of it, be careful to give his me&s;&s;age a cordial reception. If he &s;hall find it his duty to u&s;e <HI>great plainne&s;s of &s;peech,</HI> take not unrea&s;onable offence; for it is for your <HI>good.</HI> Even &s;hould he u&s;e the direct language of the text in ap|plying his di&s;cour&s;es, you have the example of David for receiving it with meekne&s;s, and feeling its force and ju&s;t|ne&s;s. Think him no more than man, <HI>&s;ubject to like pa&s;|&s;ions</HI> with others; and ever be ready to ca&s;t the mantle of charity over tho&s;e human imperfections which are in|&s;eperable from men, in their pre&s;ent lap&s;ed condition. <HI>E&s;teem</HI> him <HI>highly in love for</HI> his <HI>work's &s;ake,</HI> and <HI>&s;trive to|gether with</HI> him <HI>in your prayers to God for</HI> him. Thus may he be a rich and la&s;ting ble&s;&s;ing to you, and you become his joy and crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord.</P>
<P>Permit me to ob&s;erve here, that your connection with our order is of recent date. You were received, at your free reque&s;t, upon the conviction that a &s;en&s;e of duty and propriety dictated your choice of the pre&s;byterian mode. A &s;trict and per&s;evering adherence to the form you have adopted will manife&s;t to an ob&s;erving world the upright|ne&s;s of your intentions, and mu&s;t give un&s;peakable &s;ati&s;|faction to the body, with which you are now connected.

<P>The relation of a brief but true &s;tory to this a&s;&s;embly at large, will conclude.</P>
<P>A certain great King had an only &s;on, tenderly beloved. The &s;ubjects of this King had revolted from him, and taken arms again&s;t his throne and government; without
<PB N="21" REF="036116_0019_1007E85AB17C2AC8">any other cau&s;e but that of their own free, criminal choice. This was a crime &s;o great, that the King could pardon them in no other way, but by delivering his &s;on to death for their redemption. This he did, and the &s;on freely con&s;ented to the will of his Father. The way being thus clear to receive the rebels again to favor, the King invites them in the mo&s;t tender manner to lay a&s;ide their rebel|lious weapons, and return to him; offering them com|plete happine&s;s on this return. But they refu&s;e this kind invitation; they continue &s;till rebellious. Now, mu&s;t not all &s;ay, that <HI>they</HI> de&s;erve the greate&s;t conceivable pun|i&s;hment, not only for their revolt, but for their black in|gratitude in refu&s;ing a pardon! Let as many, then, as have not yet given cordial and &s;aving belief to the Go&s;pel-report, make the application to them&s;elves. They are the per&s;ons guilty. They are &s;till in a &s;tate of revolt from God, and neglecters of the great redemption purcha&s;ed by the death of Je&s;us. Let them at once feel and con|fe&s;s their guilt before the Lord, and humbly implore his pardoning mercy; &s;o that they may yet <HI>be found of him in peace,</HI> at <HI>the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the great object of the chri&s;tian re|ligion, as it re&s;pects mankind, is to re&s;cue them from wo and re&s;tore them to God and happine&s;s: and although all its real friends and e&s;pecially its mini&s;ters, have this object &s;o much in view and at heart, as to read|ily deny them&s;elves many innocent gratifications to ac|compli&s;h it: yet this divine religion from the fir&s;t pro|mulgation of it down through the long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of eighteen centuries, has met and been obliged to &s;truggle with ince&s;&s;ant and various <HI>oppo&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P>Strange to relate, it is openly neglected, oppo&s;ed and de&s;pi&s;ed by &s;ome who&s;e greate&s;t good it &s;eeks to promote, and who can enjoy no real good, but by its aid. And in &s;ome in&s;tances it is injured and wounded by its profe&s;&s;ed, if not its real friends.</P>
<P>Of this <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> to religion, in all its po&s;&s;ible forms and attitudes, the adorable Author was not ignorant. And being the truth and omni&s;cient, and not capable of de|ceiving mankind or his followers, gave early and public notice of it. And having the government of all things in heaven, upon the earth, and under the earth commit|ted to him, and being wonderful in coun&s;el, he at the &s;ame time provided both for the defence of his religion, and the &s;upport of his &s;ervants. Declaring that the gates of hell &s;hould never prevail again&s;t it. Bidding his little flock not to fear, for to them it was his Father's good plea&s;ure to give the kingdom.</P>
<P>All the &s;upport, relief and con&s;olation implied in this declaration and promi&s;e, the church and its true mini&s;|ters may depend upon receiving.</P>

And the giving the Right-Hand of Fellow&s;hip is in an important &s;en&s;e a pledge and a&s;&s;urance to the party receiving it, of participating in the all-&s;ufficiency of grace.</P>
<P>But as the wickedne&s;s of the human heart, and the de|vices of the adver&s;ary are many and great, &s;o great that men may think them&s;elves friends to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and promoting his cau&s;e, while in reality they are inadvert|antly or ignorantly doing things contrary to both; the po&s;&s;ibility of this, &s;ugge&s;teth the propriety of proceeding on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, and in &s;uch an act as the pre&s;ent, with caution and a degree of fear.</P>

<P>When James, Cephas, and John who &s;eemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto Paul, i. e. had &s;uitable evidence of his qualifications to preach the Go&s;pel, they gave to him and Barnabas the Right-Hand of Fellow&s;hip, that they &s;hould go to the heathens, while them&s;elves continued with the circumci&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is grace that qualifies the &s;ubject to receive, and the exhibition of that grace, authorizes him to claim, and the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t to give the Right-Hand of Fellow|&s;hip. Nor can it be doubted, but that the Apo&s;tles, readily and with &s;entiments of the mo&s;t lively joy, gave the Right-Hand of Fellow&s;hip to tho&s;e their fellow-&s;er|vants, who were partakers of the &s;ame grace of God with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, we the profe&s;&s;ed friends and &s;ervants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, convened on this occa&s;ion, having &s;atisfac|tory evidence, that you have received the gift of grace, and are qualified to preach the go&s;pel and be a mini&s;ter of his church, give you the Right-Hand of Fellow&s;hip.</P>

<P>We congratulate you, Sir, in being a member of the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t-born of God: compo&s;ed of Prophets, Apo&s;tles, and all the excellent of the earth. All who are to be made kings and Prie&s;ts to God. And tho&s;e who turn many to righteou&s;ne&s;s, to &s;hine as &s;tars forever. A &s;ociety to which the <HI>Lord of all</HI> hath made the affecting promi&s;e of "Lo I am with you always."</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the materials which form the broad ground of &s;upport and &s;trong con&s;olation to every true chri&s;tian and mini&s;ter. In the view of which, all the la|bors, afflictions, and &s;ufferings of which religion can be the occa&s;ion, are not only light, but vani&s;h in a moment.</P>
<P>May you, Sir, ever po&s;&s;e&s;s the wi&s;dom which cometh down from above, and conduct your&s;elf among this peo|ple, as becometh a mini&s;ter of the meek and lowly Je&s;us. That you may not merit blame, but the honor of being gentle, enjoy the plea&s;ure of a &s;ucce&s;sful, and reap the re|ward of a faithful mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>THE CHARGE, BY REV. WILLIAM MORISON OF LONDONDERRY, <HI>(N. H.)</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE glorious Head of the church, who walks in the mid&s;t of the golden candle&s;ticks, holding the &s;even &s;tars in his right hand, having &s;een fit, in his all-wi&s;e, governing providence, to relea&s;e you from the particular obligations you were under in another part of his vine|yard; and having inclined this people to call you, to take the pa&s;toral office over them, and at the &s;ame time di&s;po&s;ed your heart to accept their invitation;&mdash;and this Pre&s;bytery, after the mo&s;t candid attention to this peo|ple's reque&s;t, having received them under their care, and &s;u&s;tained your Call, as orderly and regular: I now, in behalf of this Pre&s;bytery, and by the authority of Chri&s;t, ve&s;ted in them, do charge you, as the ordained Mini&s;ter of the 2d Church and pari&s;h in Newbury, in manner fol|lowing:&mdash;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, with all &s;olemnity I charge you to preach the Go&s;pel of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, not in the enticing words of man's wi&s;dom, but in demon&s;tration of the Spirit, and with power; that your people's faith may &s;tand, not in the wi&s;dom of men, but in the power of God. In doing this, you will &s;tudy plainne&s;s of &s;peech and pathetic affection of mind, in all good fidelity, that your hearers may be fed with knowledge and under&s;tand|ing, and impre&s;&s;ed with the importance of the truths of God.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="036116_0024_10081B2B6278A178">
Shun the declaration of no part of the coun&s;el of God. Particularly hold up to view the di&s;tingui&s;hing doctrines of Chri&s;tianity;&mdash;the Sovereignty of God over all things in all worlds;&mdash;his boundle&s;s benevolence, with his in|flexible ju&s;tice;&mdash;his &s;potle&s;s purity, and his tender mer|cies in Chri&s;t, which are over all his other works. Un|fold to your hearers the depravity of the human heart; the nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration, and the only way of ju&s;tifi|cation, through faith in the imputed righteou&s;ness of the glorious Mediator.</P>
<P>Often dwell with delight on the comfortable doctrine of the per&s;everance of the &s;aints, as founded on the &s;ta|bility of that covenant which is well ordered in all things and &s;ure. And while you teach that without faith in the blood of this covenant, it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God; affirm al&s;o con&s;tantly that they who believe in God, mu&s;t be careful to maintain good works; and that a vi&s;ible conformity to the law of God is a better evidence of real religion than any <HI>internal pretences</HI> whatever, without it.</P>
<P>I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who &s;hall judge the quick and the dead, at his appearing, and kingdom;&mdash;preach the word, be in&s;tant in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-&s;uffering and doctrine;&mdash;&s;hewing your&s;elf to be a workman, who needeth not to be a&s;hamed, right|ly dividing the word of truth, and giving to every one their portion of meat in due &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>In doing this complicated and delightful part of your duty, you will &s;uit your&s;elf to the various capacities and nece&s;&s;ities of your hearers. You will charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor tru&s;t in uncertain riches, but in the living God; that they do good,&mdash;be rich in good works,&mdash;ready to di&s;|tribute,&mdash;willing to communicate. Enjoin upon tho&s;e in the lower &s;tations of life, obedience to their &s;uperiors; not an&s;wering again, but endeavoring to plea&s;e in all things.</P>
<P>Exhort young people to be &s;oberminded,&mdash;to remem|ber their Creator in the days of their youth. In all
<PB N="27" REF="036116_0025_10081B2DE2CBD640">things &s;hew thy&s;elf a pattern of good works; in doctrine, uncorruptne&s;s, gravity, &s;incerity and &s;ound &s;peech that cannot be condemned, that they who are of the contrary party may have no evil thing to &s;ay of you.</P>
<P>Under impre&s;&s;ions of divine authority, admini&s;ter the Sacraments of the New Te&s;tament to per&s;ons properly or vi&s;ibly qualified. Know therefore the &s;tate of your flock. &mdash;Vi&s;it the &s;ick and afflicted,&mdash;the fatherle&s;s and widows; and imitate your Ma&s;ter, who in the days of his fle&s;h, went about among his people, doing good. As far as in you lies, be like feet to the lame, &s;trength to the weak, eyes to the blind, leading them like a good &s;hepherd, in the green pa&s;tures and by the &s;till waters of God's ordi|nances. Admini&s;ter the government of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e with prudence and impartiality, knowing no man after the fle&s;h,&mdash;not re&s;pecting per&s;ons in judgment. Avoid fooli&s;h que&s;tions which gender &s;trife and alienation of mind. Remember, that the &s;ervant of the Lord mu&s;t not &s;trive, but be gentle and courteous to all men. It is an important part of the mini&s;terial character to keep our own pa&s;&s;ions in due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and to prevent our minds from being unrea&s;onably ruffled, or agitated by the di&s;a|greeable occurences of life.</P>
<P>A Mini&s;ter's mind is &s;upported by principle and im|proved by experience.</P>
<P>This is a kind of &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which will enable us to bear hard&s;hips, to &s;urmount difficulties, to vanqui&s;h temp|tations; and with &s;teady hands and undaunted hearts, to per&s;evere in the chri&s;tian warfare as good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It is under the influence of this temper of mind, that we are &s;trengthened to overcome evil with good; to profit them who hate and oppo&s;e us, and peradventure to deliver them out of the &s;nare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his plea&s;ure. Agreeably to this, the wi&s;e man informs us, he that is &s;low to wrath, is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his Spirit than he that taketh a city.</P>
<P>Neglect not the gift that is in thee by the laying on of the hands of the Pre&s;bytery. Lay hands &s;uddenly on no
<PB N="28" REF="036116_0026_1007E814AEB609D0">man. Keep thy&s;elf pure. Give thy&s;elf to pray<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> reading, to exhortation and to doctrine. Be an example to the believers, in word, in conver&s;ation, in charity, in &s;pirit, in faith, in purity. Meditate upon the&s;e things; give thy&s;elf wholly to them, that thy profiting may ap|pear unto all.</P>
<P>In fine, dear, brother, &s;tudy to glorify God in being wi&s;e to win &s;ouls, and have continual recour&s;e to him in whom trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and knowledge are hid; in whom it hath plea&s;ed the Father that all fulne&s;s &s;hould dwell, and in whom all faithful mini&s;ters are compleat for work and warfare. Be then faithful unto death, and he will give you a crown of life, and many we hope, in this place, as pre&s;ent &s;eals of your mini&s;try, and your crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord.</P>
