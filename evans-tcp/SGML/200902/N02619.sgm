<P>AS there is great Variety in the inclinations of Men in general, &s;o 'tis particularly remarkable in tho&s;e who addict them&s;elves to the Studies of Nature and Humane Lite|rature: For &s;ome with great Eagerne&s;s enquire into the Ope|rations of Nature, and the Natural Cau&s;es of Things; &s;ome endeavour to dig up Antiquities from the Dark, by &s;earching out the Signification of Statues and In&s;criptions of Antique Stones, and old and almo&s;t worn out Medals; and others pe|ru&s;e with unwearied Diligence the Hi&s;tories both of Modern and Ancient Times, and not without good Cau&s;e: For Hi|&s;tory is not unju&s;tly called the Looking gla&s;s of humane Life; not only becau&s;e it &s;heweth unto us Matters of Fact which are either commendable, or reproveable, and we behold therein that which is pa&s;t, as if it were pre&s;ent; but al&s;o becau&s;e from Things which have already happened we may learn what is be&s;t for us to do, and what we ought to avoid. And therefore great Benefit may be reaped from the Reading of Hi&s;tories, be&s;ides the Plea&s;ure which the Variety of Tran&s;actions affords to our Sen&s;es, when Matters are accompanied with &s;ingular Circum&s;tances and unexpected Events.</P>
<P>NOW &s;ince the Reading of Hi&s;torical Treati&s;es was one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant Diver&s;ions of my Youth, this drew me; when I attained to &s;ome Maturity of Age, to enquire after many Things that had happened in thy Kingdoms and Domi|nions, which by many were almo&s;t forgotten. And having ga|thered great Store of very remarkable Ca&s;es, which I thought worthy to be kept upon Record; and not buried in Oblivion, I was induced to compo&s;e an Hi&s;tory, which for the rare Occur|rences, and unu&s;ual Matter contained therein, I believe are not ea&s;ily parallell'd.</P>
<P>AND after a long and difficult Labour, having at length fini&s;hed the Work &s;o far as to expo&s;e it to publick View; and then thinking to whom I &s;hould dedicate it, it pre&s;ently came
<PB REF="003104_0003_0FEFF324B303F790">
into my Mind, that this could not be done more &s;uitably to any than to the King of the&s;e Countries, which are the chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Theatre of this Hi&s;tory; and the rather, becau&s;e therein is de+&s;cribed the Ri&s;e of a People, who are no &s;mall Part of his faith|ful Subjects: For &s;o I may &s;afely call them, &s;ince they never (how much &s;oever wrong'd and oppre&s;s'd) offer'd any Re&s;i&s;t|ance to the Government: And when for Con&s;cience &s;ake they could not comply with what was required of them, by patient Suffering they &s;hewed their Subjection and Obedience to the higher Power. Nay, when Opportunity was offer'd to revenge them&s;elves; of their Enemies, even then they would not, but left it to the Lord; and thus at all Times they behaved them|&s;elves like a peaceable People.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a Labour of more them five and twenty Years, this Hi&s;tory at length appears in publick View; to the compiling of which I was induced from the Con&s;ideration that the Ri&s;e and Encrea&s;e of that Religious Society, which in this Work I have given a circum&s;tantial Ac|count of, is indeed &s;o rare and wonderful a Thing, that I think few will be met with in Modern Hi&s;tories, which in the like Re&s;pect may be compared therewith; becau&s;e the <HI>Quakers</HI> &s;o called are become a great People, under &s;uch heavy Oppre&s;&s;ion as is herein after-mentioned; and that not by any human Power, or making Re&s;i&s;tance, but meerly by an harmle&s;s Deportment, and the exerci&s;ing of Patience; for the bearing of Arms, and the re&s;i&s;ting of the Wicked by Fighting, they always have counted unlawful, and contrary to the Doctrine of our Saviour. Thus they who had no King, Prince nor Potentate to pro|tect them, and who in the Beginning had not among them&s;elves any Men of Renown or Literature; but relying on their Integrity, and tru&s;ting to God a|lone, have at length triumphed over the Malice of their Oppo&s;ers, by &s;uffering, (which ro&s;e to that Degree, that it was at the Expence of the Lives of many of them) and under violent Oppre&s;&s;ion from High and Low, and the Oppo&s;ition of Learned and &V;nlearned.</P>
<P>ALL this having been &s;earched after, and found out by a&s;&s;iduous Diligence it appeared &s;o wonderful to me, that I re&s;olved to give a Relation thereof, not|with&s;tanding the great Labour I &s;oon perceived this Work required. To this may be added, that when I con&s;ider'd that &s;everal Authors, both <HI>Germans</HI> and others, had publi&s;hed Books and Accounts of this People, &s;tuft with gro&s;s &V;n|truths, I was the more &s;purr'd on thereby to &s;et down in due Order, for my Countrymens Sake, what I knew of the Matter; for it &s;eems indeed to be of &s;mall Advantage, that when any Thing is well known to us, we keep that Know|ledge only to our &s;elves,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Scire tuam nihil e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, ni&s;i te &s;oire hoe &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iat alt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r. <HI>Per&s;. Sat.</HI> 1.</NOTE> without imparting it to others.</P>
<P>NOW how difficult &s;oever I found this Labour, yet having made a Begin|ning, I re&s;olved to go on; and &s;o I did, tho' often &s;topt by &s;everal Acci|dents, and al&s;o other Work: For during this Labour, I have not only tran&s;lated &s;everal bulky Books into <HI>Dutch,</HI> be&s;ides <HI>Kennet's Antiquities of Rome,</HI> but al&s;o compo&s;ed &s;everal Treati&s;es of Moment, and among the&s;e my <HI>Great Dictionary Engli&s;h and Low Dutch.</HI> And notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e Impe|diments, I continually re&s;umed this Work by Intervals &s;o often, that I have written it almo&s;t thrice to make it compleat: For doubting of &s;ome Things, and finding others defective, it made me write to <HI>England</HI> for better Information; which having gotten at length after much Pains and long Waiting, I was &s;e|veral Times obliged to lay a&s;ide Part of my former De&s;cription, and make a new one; which happen'd &s;o often, that had I not been &s;upported by an unweari|ed Application, the Difficulty of the Labour, which hath been much greater in <HI>Holland</HI> than if I had compo&s;ed the Work in <HI>England,</HI> would have made me give it over. But I went on, and &s;o fini&s;h'd this Hi&s;tory in that Form as it now appears.</P>
<P><PB REF="003104_0005_0FEFF32A272F43E8">AND I am not without Thoughts, that I was prepared to be in&s;trumental for &s;uch a Work as this: For &s;everal remarkable Things I have made &V;&s;e of, I noted down before ever I thought of compo&s;ing &s;uch a Hi&s;tory; and even is my young Years, when I was in <HI>England,</HI> I copied out from Manu&s;cripts &s;eve|ral Pieces and Letters, which are in&s;erted in this Hi&s;tory, it may be hardly to be found el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>AT the fir&s;t Sight perhaps &s;ome will be ready to think that I might have &s;uper&s;eded this Labour; &s;ince the learned World hath long ago &s;een a Book written in <HI>Latin</HI> by <HI>Gerard Croe&s;e,</HI> with the Title of <HI>Hi&s;toria Quake|riana.</HI> But be it known to the Reader, that tho' the Author got the chief Contents thereof from me, yet that Relation which he gives of the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> is very imperfect and defective; and that he pre&s;u|med to relate Things of which he had no true Knowledge. I gave him indeed many Things in Writing; but not all I had collected; be&s;ides having &s;ince that Time written to my Acquaintance in <HI>England,</HI> I got Narratives of many re|markable Occurrences given forth in Print there, and many Authentick Pieces in Manu&s;cript. Now tho' this Collection was, as <HI>Ovid</HI> calleth the Chaos, <HI>Ru|dis indige&s;taque Moles,</HI> [a rude and undige&s;ted Heap;] yet from thence, and from my own Collection of Matters known to me, I have compiled the greate&s;t Part of this Hi&s;tory: But as to the Life and Tran&s;actions of <HI>G. Fox,</HI> who is largely treated of in this Work, I took them chiefly from his Journal: And the greate&s;t Part of other Occurrences, or the Lives and Tran&s;actions of others, I have taken from the Works of decea&s;ed Authors, and out of Abun|dance of &s;mall Books publi&s;hed in Print not long after the Things happened, and not contradicted by whatever I could learn.</P>
<P>TH&V;S I have endeavoured to a&s;&s;ert nothing but what I had good Au|thority for; which in regard of &s;ome Circum&s;tances, would have been yet far more difficult after the Expiration of &s;ome Years: For now Time gave Op|portunity to be informed of many Things, which &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ancient People had yet Remembrance of, and which after their Decea&s;e perhaps &s;hould have been bu|ried in Oblivion.</P>
<P>I CAN'T well omit here publickly to acknowledge the &s;ignal Kindne&s;s and Diligence of my well-beloved and much e&s;teemed Friend <HI>Theodore Eccle&s;ton</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> who hath furni&s;hed me with Abundance of Materials, not only very u&s;eful, but al&s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the compiling of this Work: From him I had Intelligence on that Account, and have exchanged a Multitude of Letters. And thus by a long continued Corre&s;pondence I came to be acquainted with many Things and Circum&s;tances, which after &s;ome Years might have been more difficult to obtain.</P>
<P>ADD to this, that I have de&s;cribed &s;everal Things well known to me, which few be&s;ides my &s;elf within the&s;e thirty or forty Years had better Know|ledge of. I have al&s;o mentioned &s;everal remarkable Ca&s;es, which I noted down from the Mouths of credible Per&s;ons, who have been dead many Years ago; and thought not that at any Time I &s;hould have publi&s;hed them in Print. In the mean while I took Account of what &s;eemed to me worthy to be left upon Record; and I collected a great Quantity of Books, wherein many Occurrences, mention|ed in this <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> were related. Of &s;uch Kind of Relations and Accounts I have made &V;&s;e, without taking from thence all that was remarkable: For it hath not been for Want of Matter that this <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> hath not run out far her, &s;ince I could have made it thrice as big, if I had been minded &s;o to do. But as I was unwilling to extend my Work any further than my Strength and Fealth in all Probability &s;hould permit, &s;o I would not glut my Reader with many
<PB REF="003104_0006_0FEFF2E61D2DECC8">
Things of one and the &s;ame Nature; but have endeavoured by Variety of Matter, to quicken his Appetite; and therefore have intermixt the &s;erious Part &s;ometimes with a facetious Accident.</P>
<P>YET I have not thought my &s;elf bound to take Notice of every odd Ca&s;e that may have happened among the <HI>Quakers</HI> &s;o called: For there have conver&s;ed among them &s;uch, who acted &s;ome particular Things that were not approved of by tho&s;e of that Society. And if any one &s;wayed by human Pa&s;&s;ion commits any Exce&s;s, which is di&s;approved of by his Fellow-Members of the Church, &s;uch an Act may not be duly imputed to the People he makes Profe&s;&s;ion with. A|mong &s;uch Particulars may be reckon'd the Ca&s;e of one <HI>He&s;ter Biddle,</HI> which <HI>Croe&s;e</HI> makes mention of, about the End of his Hi&s;tory: For tho' it was told him from the Relation &s;he gave of it at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> not with any Intention that he &s;hould publi&s;h it, yet this was a particular Ca&s;e which &s;he her &s;elf mu&s;t be re&s;pon&s;ible for; &s;ince Experience hath taught that Imagination &s;ometimes works &s;o powerfully on the Mind, that one thinks him&s;elf obliged to do a Thing which were better left undone.</P>
<P>YET for all that it is true, that Men fearing God, may mi&s;take, and thro' Ignorance do &s;omething, which others not without Rea&s;on might judge not com|mendable. Al&s;o it may happen that &s;ome again from a godly Fear have act|ed or omitted what others, no le&s;s pious, would not have &s;crupled. And tho' &s;ome among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in the Beginning of their Ri&s;e, for Fear of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing Chri&s;t's Command,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. xxviii. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your Ma|&s;ter, even Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;peaking to Per&s;ons in Authority, called them by the Name of <HI>Friend;</HI> yet others of the &s;ame Per&s;ua&s;ion have not therefore thought them|&s;elves bound to refu&s;e to Magi&s;trates their di&s;tingui&s;hing Titles of Magi&s;tracy. Nay, if any for &s;ome &s;pecial Rea&s;on may not have given a full or direct An|&s;wer to a Query, yet others of the &s;ame Society have not look'd upon this as a Pattern to imitate. For the mo&s;t eminent Valiants among this People in the Beginning were not Men of Note or Learning, tho' of great Courage, in&s;omuch that their immoveable Stedfa&s;tne&s;s &s;ometimes &s;o exa&s;perated their Enemies, that their Fear of doing or omitting any Thing which they judged would di&s;|plea&s;e God, often hath been &s;tampt with the odious Denomination of Stubborn|ne&s;s and Stiffneckedne&s;s; but they have born this patiently, believing that it was their Duty to per&s;evere immoveably in minding their Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion, and in frequenting their religious A&s;&s;emblies. And that &s;uch a Stedfa&s;tne&s;s was the Duty of a Chri&s;tian, &s;eems al&s;o to have been the Judgment of the Authors of the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith of the reformed Churches in the Ne|therlands, Art. xxviii.</HI> where it is &s;aid, <HI>That it is the Office or Duty of all Believers, to &s;eparate them&s;elves according to the Word of God from tho&s;e that are not of the Church; and to joyn to this Congre|gation, in what Place &s;oever God hath placed them, tho' the Magi|&s;trates and Edicts of Princes were again&s;t it, and that Death, or any corporal Puni&s;hment was annex'd to it.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true, there have been &s;uch among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> who were exceeding bold in repre&s;enting to their Enemies their evil Behaviour and Deportment: But this hath been a peculiar Talent of pious Men, of whom Examples was extant in the Books of Martyrs, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;ome of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> very plain Terms told their Per&s;ecutors of their Wickedne&s;s. Very remarkable in that Re&s;pect, is the Speech of <HI>John Molleus,</HI> who about the Year 1653, being Pri&s;oner at <HI>Rome,</HI> without any Di&s;&s;imulation, expo&s;ed to publick View the wicked Lives of the Cardinals and Bi&s;hops, who were ordered by the Pope to examime him. The like Boldne&s;s appears al&s;o in the Letter of <HI>Hans van Hoven|dam,</HI> to the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Ghem</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in the
<PB REF="003104_0007_0FEFF32C9CD3EDB8">
<HI>Mirror of Martyrs of the Bapti&s;ts.</HI> From whence it appears, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> have not been the only People, who have told their Per&s;ecutors very boldly of their wicked Deportment and Cruelty.</P>
<P>IT can't be denied that there have been at Times, among the Society, &s;ome People of an odd Behaviour, who in Proce&s;s of Time embraced &s;trange Opinions and perver&s;e Notions: But that's no new Thing; &s;ince this hath hap|pened al&s;o among tho&s;e of other Per&s;ua&s;ions, tho' none of the&s;e would allow that this was the Con&s;equence or Effect of their Doctrine. We find in Sacred Writ, that even in the Primitive Chri&s;tian Church there were Apo&s;tates, either &s;uch as maintained &s;trange Doctrine, as the <HI>Nicolaitanes,</HI> or &s;uch who finding the &s;trait Way too narrow for them, left it, and like <HI>Demas,</HI> falling in Love again with the World, entred into the broad Way. And therefore it can now no more than then, be argued from thence, that the Exorbitances to which &s;ome launched out, were the Effects of the Doctrine they for&s;ook.</P>
<P>SINCE in this Hi&s;tory &s;ome Predictions are al&s;o mention'd, and that &s;ome bya&s;&s;ed by Prejudice, will perhaps look upon them as frivolous, imagining that the <HI>Quakers</HI> pretend to have the Spirit of Prophecy; I'll an&s;wer to this, That tho' among Thou&s;ands of them there may have been One that prophetically foretold a Thing, which afterwards truly happened; yet others of that Society pre&s;umed to have that Gift, no more than to have that of being a Preacher: And all are not called to that Work. There mu&s;t be Antece&s;&s;ors and Leaders in the religious Oeconomy, as well as in the Politick State: For if every one not qualified &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the Office of Governing, Things would &s;oon run into Confu&s;ion. Now tho' &s;ome have had this fal&s;e Conceit, that to be able to pre|dict future Things was a Quality the <HI>Quakers</HI> attributed to them&s;elves, as pro|ceeding from their Doctrine, that Chri&s;tians ought to be led by the Spirit of God; yet this is a very &s;ini&s;ter and prepo&s;terous Conceit: For what they &s;ay concerning the Leading and Guiding of the Spirit of God, is agreeable with the Doctrine of the Apo&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. viii. 14.</NOTE> who &s;aith, <HI>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</HI> And this was al&s;o the Doctrine of the fir&s;t Reform|ers. What mu&s;t we think then of tho&s;e who will not be led by this Spirit, but call this Doctrine by the odious Denomination of Enthu&s;ia&s;m? The &s;ame Apo|&s;tle tells us al&s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> viii. 9.</NOTE> <HI>If any have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his.</HI> And he al&s;o &s;aith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. xli. 7.</NOTE> <HI>The Manife&s;tation of the Spirit is given to every Man to profit withal.</HI> But from thence it doth in no wi&s;e follow, that the Spirit of Prophecy is given to every one; neither that altho' it might plea&s;e God to reveal to One a Thing which was yet to come, &s;uch an One therefore was endued with a Prophetical Spirit, that he was able at any Time, to predict future Things.</P>
<P>IF this Po&s;ition be true, then tho&s;e of other Per&s;ua&s;ions might al&s;o lay Claim to that Prerogative; becau&s;e among them &s;ometimes there have been pious Men, who predicted remarkable Things, which afterwards really happened; as among&s;t the re&s;t, <HI>James U&s;her</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Armagh,</HI> and Primate of <HI>Ireland;</HI> who foretold the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland</HI> Forty Years before it came to pa&s;s; be&s;ides the inte&s;tine War and Mi&s;eries that befel <HI>England,</HI> and other Things that were fulfilled; which leads us not to reject as frivolous his Predic|tion of the dreadful Per&s;ecution that would fall upon all the Prote&s;tant Churches by the <HI>Papi&s;ts:</HI> For tho' one of his Friends once objected to him, That &s;ince <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> had already &s;uffered &s;o deeply, there was Rea&s;on to hope that the Judgments of God in re&s;pect of the&s;e Kingdoms might have been pa&s;t; yet he replied to it, <HI>Fool not your &s;elves with &s;uch Hopes; for I tell you, all you have yet &s;een hath been but the Beginning of Sorrows to what is yet to come upon the Prote&s;tant Churches of
<PB REF="003104_0008_0FEFF2E938519270">
Chri&s;t, who will ere long fall under a &s;harper Per&s;ecution than ever yet hath been upon them. And therefore look you be not found in the outward Court, but a Wor&s;hipper in the Temple before the Al|tar: For Chri&s;t will mea&s;ure all tho&s;e that profe&s;s his Name, and call them&s;elves his People; and the outward Wor&s;hippers he will leave out, to be trodden down by the</HI> Gentiles. <HI>The outward Court is the formal Chri&s;tian, who&s;e Religion lies in performing the Out&s;ide Du|ties ot Chri&s;tianity, without having an inward Life and Power of Faith and Love uniting them to Chri&s;t: And the&s;e God will leave to be trodden down, and &s;wept away by the</HI> Gentiles. <HI>But the Wor&s;hip|pers within the Temple, and before the Altar, are tho&s;e who do in|deed wor&s;hip God in Spirit and in Truth, who&s;e Souls are made his Temples, and he is honoured and adored in the mo&s;t inward Thoughts of their Hearts, and they &s;acrifice their Lu&s;ts and vile Affections, yea, and their own Wills to him: And the&s;e God will hide in the Hollow of his Hand, and under the Shadow of his Wings. And this &s;hall be the great Difference between this la&s;t, and all the other pre|ceeding Per&s;ecutions: For in the former, the mo&s;t eminent and &s;piri|tual Mini&s;ters and Chri&s;tians did generally &s;uffer mo&s;t, and were mo&s;t violently fallen upon; but in this la&s;t Per&s;ecution the&s;e &s;hall be pre|&s;erved by God as a Seed to partake of that Glory which &s;hall imme|diately follow, and come upon the Church, as &s;oon as ever this Storm &s;hall be over: For as it &s;hall be the &s;harpe&s;t, &s;o it &s;hall be the &s;horte&s;t Per&s;ecution of them all, and &s;hall only take away the gro&s;s Hypocrites and formal Profe&s;&s;ors; but the true Spiritual Believers &s;hall be pre|&s;erved till the Calamity be over-pa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>IF any now a-days &s;hould &s;peak at this Rate, it's credible, that many who think them&s;elves to be good Chri&s;tians, would decry this as meer Enthu&s;ia&s;m. But the &s;aid Bi&s;hop is &s;till in &s;uch great Repute with the Learned, and hath obtained &s;uch an high E&s;teem by his Writings, that his Words are likely to be of more Weight with many, than tho&s;e of other pious Men. And therefore I was willing to renew them, and revive his Memory, if perhaps this might make form Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Minds of any: For this is a certain Truth, that no outward Performances will avail any, if they do not wor&s;hip God in Spirit and in Truth; for &s;uch Wor&s;hippers God &s;eeks, according to what our Saviour him&s;elf &s;aid:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. vii. 21, 22, 23.</NOTE> Be&s;ides, that <HI>Not every one that &s;aith to</HI> him, <HI>Lord, Lord, &s;hall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</HI> Nay, when many in that Day will &s;ay to him, <HI>Lord, Have we not prophe&s;ied in thy Name?</HI> He will &s;ay to them, <HI>I never knew you; Depart from me ye that work Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>AS the many &s;ingular Ca&s;es related in this Hi&s;tory will afford no un|plea&s;ing Entertainment to curious Readers, &s;o they will be found al&s;o in&s;tructive; for we &s;hall not only meet with In&s;tances of true Piety and Love to one's Neighbour, and of Saints triumphing on their Death-beds, and al&s;o with re|markable Examples of Sinners truly penitent at the Hour of Death: but we may al&s;o find here Abundance of Proofs of a peaceable Behaviour: For the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, have not plotted again&s;t the Government, nor meddled with trea&s;onable Practices or Rebellions: And how much &s;oever they were op|pre&s;&s;ed, yet they always were quiet, and never made any Re&s;i&s;tance, but with an harmle&s;s Patience they have born their mo&s;t heavy Oppre&s;&s;ions and Inju|ries, and &s;o it length overcame: For to be &s;ubject to Magi&s;tracy hath always been one of their Principles; and that they were really dutiful Subjects, they have &s;hewed at all Times, by paying Obedience to the Higher Power, in all they could do with a good Con&s;cience. And when any Thing was required of them, which from a reverential Re&s;pect to God they dur&s;t not do, or omit,
<PB REF="003104_0009_0FEFF32EF1AFBA00">
they have &s;hewed their Obedience by &s;uffering, without making any Re&s;i&s;tance, or joining with others who were inclined thereto.</P>
<P>NOW tho' many have made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to repre&s;ent them in odious Col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs, and to write great &V;ntruths concerning them, nay to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">en Doctrines upon them which they never approved, and that not a fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d have contended again&s;t them with their Pens, yet among the&s;e, there have al&s;o been &s;uch, who' tho' they never joyn'd with, yet gaved a good Account and fa|vourable Te&s;timony concerning them; as may be &s;een in <HI>Richard Claridge</HI>'s An&s;wer to a Book of <HI>Edward Cock&s;on,</HI> pag. 266, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> And at <HI>Am&s;ter|dam</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> many Years ago a Learned Man publi&s;hed a Book called, <HI>Lucerna &s;uper Cande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">abrum,</HI> wherein is very eminently defended the Doctrine of the <HI>Inward Light;</HI> and this Book was publi&s;hed in <HI>Dutch,</HI> and afterwards al&s;o into <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> with the Title of <HI>The Light upon the Candle&s;tick;</HI> and &s;ince the Name of <HI>William Ames,</HI> a zealous Preacher among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> was placed upon the Title, many have believed him to be the Author of that Book, becau&s;e his Doctrine of the Divine and Inward Light was &s;o effectually a&s;&s;erted therein. That he approved the Contents of the Book I know; but I know al&s;o that it never proceeded from his Pen. And many Years afterwards it was publi&s;hed under the Name of one <HI>Peter Balling</HI> as the Author, tho' there were tho&s;e who father'd it upon <HI>Adam Boreel,</HI> becau&s;e it is found print|ed in <HI>Latin</HI> among his <HI>Scripta Po&s;thuma.</HI> And this Opinion it not altoge|ther improbable; for among his Works are found al&s;o &s;ome other Writings, that contain &s;everal Po&s;itions a&s;&s;erted by the <HI>Quakers:</HI> Be&s;ides, he and &s;ome other of the Collegians, and among th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e al&s;o Dr. <HI>Galenus Abraham&s;on,</HI> were &s;o effectually convinced of the Doctrine preached by <HI>William Ames,</HI> when he fir&s;t came to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> that they approved of it; tho' after|wards from a Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion they oppo&s;ed it. Now if we pre&s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Adam Boreel</HI> was the Author of the &s;aid <HI>Latin</HI> Book, <HI>Peter Balling</HI> might be the Tran&s;lator thereof into <HI>Dutch;</HI> for that it was originally written in <HI>Latin,</HI> &s;eems to me very probable.</P>
<P>B&V;T however this be, it appears plainly, that the Author would not pub|lickly be known, for the Title &s;eemed de&s;ignedly compo&s;ed &s;o, that the Readers &s;hould believe <HI>W. Ames</HI> to be the Author of it, <HI>viz. The Light on the Candle&s;tick, &s;erving for Illu&s;tration of the Principal Matters in the Book called,</HI> The My&s;teries of the Kingdom of God, &amp;c. <HI>again&s;t</HI> Galenus Abraham&s;on, <HI>and his A&s;&s;enters, treated of, and written by</HI> W. Ames. And this Name &s;tood in Capital Letters underneath, in &s;uch a Manner as the Name of an Author is u&s;ually placed upon a Title tho' the Publi&s;her meant no more, but that <HI>W. Ames</HI> was the Author of the Book called, <HI>The My&s;teries of the Kingdom of God.</HI> And there was no Printer's Name added to it, but only, <HI>Printed for the Author,</HI> 1662.</P>
<P>NOW tho' I can't tell certainly who was the Author, yet I have thought fit, &s;ince the &s;aid Book is not ea&s;ily to be got in <HI>Latin,</HI> to in&s;ert it in the Appendix of this Hi&s;tory; from whence it may appear, as well as from the Writings of &s;ome others, that there have been &s;uch as either commended the <HI>Quakers,</HI> or defended their Doctrine, tho' they them&s;elves never could re&s;olve to joyn with them publickly.</P>
<P>B&V;T notwith&s;tanding all this, there have been others, who to render the Doctrine, the Deportment, and Carriage of the <HI>Quakers</HI> &s;u&s;pected and odious, have been ready to repre&s;ent their hone&s;t Behaviour and religious Life as Pha|ri&s;aical Righteou&s;ne&s;s; altho' Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles &s;o earne&s;tly recommended &s;uch a Life.<NOTE PLACE="marg">v. 18.</NOTE> Pray what mean the&s;e Words of our Saviour, <HI>Be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> perfect,

<P>B&V;T tho' the <HI>Quakers</HI> have endeavoured to make their Life and Con|ver&s;ation agree with their Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion, yet this hath rai&s;ed Envy, Grudge and Malice again&s;t them: And among the Clergy there have been &s;uch, who to render them odious, did not &s;tick to repre&s;ent them as di&s;gui&s;ed Papi&s;ts, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e were none of their meane&s;t Enemies. For, after a due Reflection and Con&s;ideration, it hath &s;eemed to me, that when King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second was on the Throne, the <HI>Romani&s;ts,</HI> and &s;uch among the <HI>Church of England</HI> as favoured them, were the cheif Promoters of Per&s;ecu|tion. And the&s;e, to pur&s;ue their wicked Ends, would not proceed according to Law, in the Trials of impri&s;oned <HI>Quakers;</HI> but they continually &s;trove to in|troduce an arbitrary Power; and &s;o, from Time to Time, they did not omit to pro&s;ecute the <HI>Quakers</HI> &s;everely, thinking that when they were once &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the other Di&s;&s;enters mu&s;t fall of Nece&s;&s;ity, tho' they were not for Non-Re&s;i&s;t|ance. But Providence acted very remarkably; for when a Popi&s;h Prince af|terwards would introduce Liberty of Con&s;cience, the Eyes of the mo&s;t moderate Maintainers of the <HI>Church of England</HI> came to be &s;o opened, that in the Reign of King <HI>William III.</HI> they promoted a general Liberty of Con&s;cience, by which the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> at length obtained Liberty to perform their publick Wor&s;hip without Mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>TH&V;S far the Limits of this Hi&s;tory are extended; and being arrived there, I did not think my &s;elf bound to enlarge any farther; what follows be|ing no more than an Overplus.</P>
<P>I HAVE related nothing in this Work, but what I believed to be unque|&s;tionably true: For what &s;eemed doubtful to me I rather choo&s;e to pa&s;s by, having never been of &s;o credulous a Temper, as ea&s;ily to take Things on Tru&s;t without due Examination: For we often &s;ee that high-&s;oaring Imagina|tions make People believe Things that are far from being true. But for all that, we ought not to reject as untrue every Thing that appears &s;trange or unu&s;ual; &s;ince Experience convinceth us of the contrary, <HI>viz.</HI> that &s;ometimes we have &s;een a Thing, which if we had not beheld with our own Eyes, we could hardly have believed. Wherefore I would not reject as untrue what was extraordinary or unu&s;ual, when it was told me by credible Per&s;ons, or confirm|ed by Eye-Witne&s;&s;es. And therefore, tho' my Reader may meet with &s;ome very &s;ingular Occurrences, yet this is true, that I have endeavoured to the utmo&s;t to relate nothing, but what after a nice Enquiry &s;eemed to me to be true, or at lea&s;t very probable. And yet I have &s;ilently pa&s;s'd over &s;ome Ca&s;es which I did not que&s;tion to be true, le&s;t any might think me too credu|lous.</P>
<P><PB REF="003104_0011_0FEFF3326886B1E0">AS to the Tran&s;actions of State-Affairs, I have taken them mo&s;tly from <HI>The Hi&s;tory of the Rebellion and the Civil Wars in</HI> England, <HI>written by</HI> Edward <HI>Earl of</HI> Clarendon, and from the <HI>Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow:</HI> Yet &s;ome few Things relating to State-Affairs, that have not been mentioned by them, nor in any other publick Hi&s;tory that I know of, I thought worthy to be delivered to Po&s;terity by my Pen.</P>
<P>FOR my Stile, I know it is but indifferent: I do not pretend to Elegancy in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue; for being a Foreigner, and never having been in <HI>Eng|land</HI> but about the Space of ten Months, and that near Fifty Years ago, it ought not to be expected that I &s;hould write <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;o well as <HI>Dutch,</HI> my Native Language. If therefore my Pen &s;ometimes hath been guilty of a Belgici&s;m, I beg Excu&s;e of my Reader. And &s;ince my Ab&s;ence hath hindred me from cor|recting the Printer's Mi&s;takes, either in Omi&s;&s;ions or other Errors, &s;uch Faults I don't think my &s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible for, becau&s;e I have been fain to tru&s;t the Over&s;ight and Correction of my Work to others, who may have been more lia|ble to let Errors e&s;cape, than my &s;elf &s;hould have been. This I hope will &s;uf|fice to excu&s;e me with di&s;creet Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>WHAT the Envious may judge of this Work I little care for, well knowing that the mo&s;t eminent Authors have been expo&s;ed to Envy, and been obnoxious to the Cen&s;ures of Pedantick Criticks. Whatever any may think, this I am well a&s;&s;ured of, that my chief Scope hath been by the Relation of many unu&s;ual Oc|currences, not only to delight my Reader, but al&s;o to lead him to Vertue. If I may be &s;o happy as to have contributed thereto, I &s;hall think my Pains well rewarded; and if not, I &s;hall have at lea&s;t this Satisfaction, that accord|ing to my Ability I have endeavoured to be beneficial to others, and to ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> my Fellow-Mortals in that which is good: Which I can't but think to be well|plea&s;ing to God. And if I have performed any Thing that is good, the Ho|nour and Glory thereof belongs to him, who is the Giver of all good Gifts; and it is from Him alone I have received all my Ability to do any good Thing. Thus concluding, I wi&s;h the Reader Di&s;cretion, and an impartial Judgment.</P>

<P>THAT the marvelous Work of <HI>Reformation</HI> hath been &s;mall and of very little E&s;teem in its Beginning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1415</NOTE> and yet been ad|vanc'd with remarkable Progre&s;s, will, I believe, be deny'd by none, that have read with Attention and a due Con&s;ideration the Hi&s;tory of its fir&s;t Ri&s;e; &s;ince God, the Beginner and Author of this glorious Work, proceeding by Steps and Degrees, hath u&s;ed there|in &s;uch &s;ingular Wi&s;dom and Prudence, that, (every Circum&s;tance du|ly con&s;ider'd) in&s;tead of cen&s;uring any Part thereof, they will be ob|lig'd to cry out <HI>Thou, O Lord, alone knowe&s;t the right Times and Sea&s;ons to open the Eyes of People, and to make them capable of thy Truth!</HI> For if we look to the fir&s;t Beginnings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">J.Hus</NOTE> to go back no farther than <HI>John Hus,</HI> we &s;hall find, that tho in many Things he was con&s;iderably enlightned, yet he remain'd &s;till in &s;everal gro&s;s Errors; for altho' he had a clear Sight of the vain Doctrines of Purgatory, Praying to, and Wor|&s;hipping of Images, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> neverthele&s;s it is reported of him, that he fa|vour'd the Invocation of Saints, the Seven Sacraments, Auricular Confe&s;&s;ion, and other Tenets of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> and yet Chri|&s;tian Charity con&s;trains us to believe (tho' we find Prote&s;tant Wri|ters who deny him the Name of a Martyr) that by his Death, which he &s;uffer d in the Flames at <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> on the Sixth of the Month call'd <HI>July,</HI> in the Year 1415, he hath been an acceptable Sacrifice unto God: And with what a &s;edate and well compos'd Mind he &s;uffer'd Death, may be concluded from this, That he &s;eeing a Country-Fellow very zealou&s;ly carrying Wood to burn him, &s;aid, with a &s;miling Countenance, <HI>O holy Simplicity!</HI> and that after the Fire was kindled, he &s;ang with Joy in the Flames, his Mind being firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd on God; for he had been faithful according to his Knowledge, and had not hid his Talent in the Earth, but improv'd it, having &s;hewn him&s;elf a zealous Promoter of that &s;mall Illumination which God was pleas'd to grant him; it being, without Que&s;tion, great enough in that grievous Night of Darkne&s;s, when Idolatry had &s;o univer&s;ally blinded Mankind, that morally &s;peaking, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for them to have under&s;tood the Declaration of an entirely reform'd Re|ligion; whereas it is evident that the mo&s;t &s;ober and di&s;creet People of that Age were capable to under&s;tand the Doctrine and Sermons of that hone&s;t Man.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003104_0013_0FEFF3356D2ADDC0">To give a clearer Pro&s;pect into this Matter, let it be con&s;ider'd, that if a Man had been kept &s;hut up a long Time in a dark Pri&s;on, where he could neither behold the Light of the Sun or Moon, and &s;hould have been let out on a &s;udden at clear Noon-Day, he would not only not be able to endure the bright Day-Light, but would al&s;o, if he &s;trove to open his Eyes with Force, be endanger'd of lo&s;ing, his Sight, and fal|ling into a wor&s;e Condition than he was in before; whereas if he had been brought into the open Air at the Time of Twilight, he would by Degrees have learned to di&s;cern the Objects, and come to an Ability of beholding every Thing in a clear Day aright.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this, in the Reigns of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth and the bloody Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> the principal Te&s;t in <HI>England</HI> was, Whether a Man owned the Corporal Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in the Sacrament; and he who denied this, was to be burnt as an Heretick; al&s;o in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> 'twas enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o bring a Man to the Stake, if he confe&s;&s;ed that he had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e-baptized.

<P>If we rightly look into this, it &s;eems very ab&s;urd to think that the Reformation (which in former Times had been pretty much advanced by &s;ome eminent Men; as <HI>Luther, Melancthon, Oecolompadius, Calvin, Men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o,</HI> and others) then was brought to Perfection; for we perceive that even tho&s;e Reformers them&s;elves at fir&s;t had not &s;uch a clear Sight into ma|ny Things, as afterwards they got; which to demon&s;trate at large, I count unnece&s;&s;ary; &s;ince <HI>England</HI> being the chiefe&s;t Stage, on which the Things I intend to de&s;cribe, have been tran&s;acted, I'll turn, my Face thi|therward, to take a View cur&s;orily of the Beginning and Proce&s;s of the Reformation there.

Whether decea&s;ed Saints ought to be invocated? and how Images were to be regarded;</Q> well needed to be enquired into; &s;ince it began to appear, that &s;everal Things were Errors, for which &s;ome People not long before had &s;uffer'd Death.<NOTE PLACE="marg">T.Cromwel.</NOTE> Some Time after, <HI>Thomas Cromwel,</HI> a chief Mini&s;ter of the Kingdom, and a great Friend of <HI>Cranmer,</HI> publi&s;h'd &s;ome Injunctions in the King's Name, wherein all Churchmen were re|quir'd, no more to recommend to People, Images, Relicks, or Pilgri|mages, but to teach them the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Commandments in <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> This was a great Step towards the Tran&s;lation of the Bible into <HI>English,</HI> which being al&s;o further'd by <HI>Cranmer,</HI> the next Year came out in Print;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1537</NOTE> and by the King's Warrant, the Clergy were requir'd to &s;et up Bibles it their Churches; &s;o that now, all that could might read the Holy Scripture in their native Tongue. <HI>Cranmer</HI> not content with this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1539</NOTE> obtain'd in the Year 1539, a Permi&s;&s;ion for all People to have the Bible in their Hou&s;es; yet for all that, he &s;till was an A&s;|&s;ertor of the corporal Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in the Ho&s;t, until in the Year 1549,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1549 N.Ridley.</NOTE> in the Reign of King <HI>Edward VI.</HI> when the Times were more free, he was induc'd by <HI>Nicholas Ridley,</HI> a zealous Reformer, and afterwards a Martyr under Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> to enquire better into the Thing, and to di&s;cover

cover the Ab&s;urdity of it; from whence he did not only oppo&s;e and &s;up|pre&s; that Super&s;tition, but al&s;o many others; and it is likely, that if Opportunity had been given him, he would have reformed more Things. Neverthele&s;s, it can't but be wondred at, that he who &s;eems to have been a Man of a meek Temper, could give his Vote for the Burning of tho&s;e whom he look'd upon to be Hereticks; as <HI>John Nichol&s;on,</HI> alias <HI>Lambert,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. for denying of the corporal Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in the Sacrament; and <HI>Joan Bocher</HI> and <HI>George Parr</HI> under <HI>Edward</HI> VI. the fir&s;t for denying that Chri&s;t had taken Fle&s;h from the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and the latter for not believing the Deity of Chri&s;t: From whence we may &s;ee what a wrong Zeal for Religion is able to effect: But without que|&s;tion he was become of another Mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1556</NOTE> when in the Year 1556, under the bloody Reign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> this was not only laid in his Di&s;h, but he al&s;o was forc'd to undergo the &s;ame Lot of being burnt alive.</P>
<P>Now tho' after his Death the Bi&s;hops under Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> were content with the Reformation made by <HI>Cranmer,</HI> yet it plea&s;ed God in the Year 1568,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1568</NOTE> to rai&s;e other Per&s;ons that te&s;tify'd publickly again&s;t many of the remaining Super&s;titions; and altho' <HI>Coleman, Burton, Hal|lingham,</HI> and <HI>Ben&s;on,</HI> were impri&s;on'd by the Queen's Order, yet they got many Followers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Puritans.</NOTE> and al&s;o the Name of Puritans.

In this time he fell into a &s;trong Temptation, almo&s;t to De&s;pair, and was in mighty Trouble, &s;ometimes keeping him&s;elf retir'd in his Chamber, and often walking &s;olitarily to want upon the Lord. In this State he &s;aw how Chri&s;t had been tempted; but when he look'd to his own Condition, he wondered, and &s;aid, <HI>Was I ever &s;o before.</HI> He began to think al&s;o that he had done ami&s;s again&s;t his Relations, becau&s;e he had for&s;aken them; and he called to Mind all his former Time, to con&s;ider whether he had wrong'd any. Thus Temptations grew more and more; and when Satan could not effect his De&s;ign upon him that Way, he laid Snares for him to draw him to commit &s;ome Sin, thereby to bring him to De&s;pair. He was then about twenty Years of Age, and continu'd a long while in this Condition, and would fain have put it from him; which made him go to many a Prie&s;t to look for Comfort, but he did not find it from them. In this mi&s;erable State he went to <HI>London,</HI> in Hopes or finding &s;ome Relief among the great Profe&s;&s;ors of that City: But be|ing come there, he &s;aw them much darkned in their Under&s;tandings. He had an Uncle there, one <HI>Pickering,</HI> a <HI>Bapti&s;t,</HI> and tho&s;e of that Per|&s;ua&s;ion were tender then; yet he could not re&s;olve to impart his Mind to them, or join with them, becau&s;e he &s;aw all, Young and Old, where they were. And tho' &s;ome of the be&s;t would have had him &s;taid there, yet he was fearful, and &s;o return'd homewards; for having under&s;tood that his Parents and Relations were troubled at his Ab&s;ence, he would rather go to them again l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t he &s;hould grieve them. Now when he was come into <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> his Relations would have had him marry'd; but he prudently told them, <HI>He was but a Lad, and mu&s;t get Wi&s;dom.</HI> Others would have had him in the Auxiliary B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd among the Forces of the Par|liament, which being enter'd now into an inte&s;tine War with the King, had, with their Forces this Year, beaten not only the King's Army under Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> but al&s;o conquer'd the City of <HI>York.</HI> But to per&s;uade

Then <HI>Nathaniel Stevens,</HI> the Prie&s;t of <HI>Drayton,</HI> (the Town of <HI>George</HI>'s Birth) would often come to him, and <HI>George</HI> to the Prie&s;t; and when <HI>Stevens</HI> vi&s;ited him he would &s;ometimes bring another Prie&s;t along with him, and then <HI>George Fox</HI> would ask them Que&s;tions, and did rea&s;on with them. Once <HI>Stevens</HI> ask d him, <HI>Why Chri&s;t cry d out upon the Cro&s;s, My God, My God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?</HI> And why he &s;aid, <HI>If it be po&s;&s;ible let this Cup pa&s;s from me; yet not my Will, but thine be done?</HI> To this <HI>George Fox</HI> an&s;wer d thus; <Q>At that Time the Sins of all Mankind were upon Chri&s;t, and their Iniquities and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions with which he was wounded, which he was to bear, and to be an Offering for them, as he was Man, but died not as he was God: And &s;o, in that he died for all Men, and ta&s;ted Death for every Man, he was an Offering for the Sins of the whole World.</Q> When <HI>George Fox</HI> &s;poke this, he was in a Mea&s;ure &s;en&s;ible of Chri&s;t's Sufferings, and what he went through. And his &s;aying &s;o, did &s;o plea&s;e the Prie&s;t, that he &s;aid, <HI>It was a very good full An|&s;wer, and &s;uch an one as he had not heard.</HI> He would al&s;o applaud and &s;peak highly of <HI>George Fox</HI> to others, and what <HI>George</HI> &s;aid in Di&s;cour&s;e to him, that he would preach of on the Fir&s;t Days of the Week: For which <HI>George</HI> did not like him. After &s;ome Time he went to an ancient Prie&s;t at <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;etter</HI> in <HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> and rea&s;oned with him about the Ground of De&s;pair and Temptations; but he being altogether ignorant of <HI>George</HI>'s Condition, bid him take Tobacco, and &s;ing <HI>P&s;alms.</HI> But <HI>George</HI> &s;ignified that he was no Lover of Tobacco, and as for <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> he was not in a State to &s;ing. Then the Prie&s;t bid him come again, and that then he would tell him many Things. But when <HI>George</HI> came, the Prie&s;t was angry and petti&s;h, for <HI>George</HI>'s former Words had di&s;plea&s;ed him; and he was &s;o indi&s;creet, that what <HI>George Fox</HI> had told him of his Sor|rows and Griefs, he told again to his Servants, &s;o that it got among the Milk-La&s;&s;es; which grieved him to have opened his Mind to &s;uch an one; and he &s;aw they were all mi&s;erable Comforters. Then he heard of a Prie&s;t living about <HI>Tamworth,</HI> who was accounted an experienced Man, and therefore he went to him, but found him like an empty hollow Cask. Hearing afterwards of one Dr. <HI>Craddock</HI> of <HI>Coventry,</HI> he went to him al&s;o, and asked him whence Temptations and De&s;pair did ari&s;e, and how Troubles came to be wrought in Man. The Prie&s;t, in&s;tead of an&s;wer|ing, ask'd him, <HI>Who was Chri&s;t's Father and Mother?</HI> And <HI>George</HI> told him, Mary <HI>was his Mother, and he was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Son of</HI> Jo&s;eph, <HI>but he was the Son of God.</HI> Now as they were walking together in Dr. <HI>Craddock</HI>'s Garden, it happen'd that <HI>George</HI> in turning, &s;et his Foot on the Side of a Bed, which &s;o di&s;turbed that Teacher, as if his Hou&s;e had been on Fire, and thus all their Di&s;cour&s;e was lo&s;t; and <HI>George Fox</HI> went away in Sorrow, wor&s;e than he was when he came, &s;eeing he found none that could reach his Condition. After this he went to one <HI>Macham,</HI> a Prie&s;t of high Account; and he, no more skilful than the others, was for gi|ving <HI>George</HI> &s;ome Phy&s;ick and for bleeding him; but they could not get one Drop of Blood from him, either in the Arms or the Head, his Body being, as it were, dried up with Sorrows, Grief, and Trouble, which were &s;o great upon him, that he could have wi&s;hed never to have been born, to behold the Vanity and Wickedne&s;s of Men; or that he had been born blind, and &s;o he might never have &s;een it; and deaf,

that he might never have heard vain and wicked Words, or the Lord's Name bla&s;phemed. And when the Time called <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">mas</HI> came, while others were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;ting and &s;porting them&s;elves, he went from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, looking, for p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or Widows, and giving them &s;ome Money.

<P>Whil&s;t the Mind of <HI>George Fox</HI> was thus in Trouble, the State of <HI>Eng|land</HI> was al&s;o in a great Stir; for the Parliament was for turning out of Bi&s;hops, and introducing the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Directory; which however as yet could not well be effected, altho' <HI>William Laud,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canter|bury,</HI> had been made to &s;toop to the Block; and the Power of the King by this Time was much weaken'd; for his Army was this Summer near <HI>Na&s;eby,</HI> not far from <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> overcome by an Army of untrain d Bands, and about &s;ix Thou&s;and Men, among which many great Officers were taken Pri&s;oners, and his Cabinet, with abundance of Letters of great Moment, was &s;eiz'd; in&s;omuch, that tho' &s;ome Skirmi&s;hes were held, yet no deci&s;ive Battle was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ought afterwards.</P>
<P>But &s;ince a circum&s;tantial De&s;cription of the&s;e State-Affairs is not with|in my De&s;ign, I ll return again to <HI>George Fox,</HI> who in the Beginning of the Year 1646,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1646</NOTE> as he was going to <HI>Coventry,</HI> and entring, towards the Gate, a Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ideration aro&s;e in him, how it was &s;aid, that <HI>All Chri&s;tians are Believers,</HI> both Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts: And it was opened to him, that if all were Believers, then they were all born of God, and pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life, and that none were true Believers but &s;uch: And tho' others &s;aid they were Believers, yet they were not. At ano|ther Time as he was walking in a Field on a Fir&s;t Day Morning, it was di&s;cover d unto his Under&s;tanding, that <HI>to be bred at</HI> Oxford, <HI>or</HI> Cambridge <HI>was not enough to make a Man to be a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t.</HI> At this he won|der d, becau&s;e it was the common Belief of People; but for all that, he took this to be a divine Revelation, and he admir d the Goodne&s;s of the Lord, believing now the ordinary Mini&s;ters not to be &s;uch as they pre|tended to be. This made him unwilling to go any more to Church, as it was called, to hear the Prie&s;t <HI>Stevens,</HI> believing that he could not pro|fit thereby: And therefore in&s;tead of going there, he would get into the Orchard, or the Fields, by him&s;elf with his Bible, which he e&s;teemed above all Books, &s;eeking thus to be edified in Solitarine&s;s. At this his Relations were much troubled: But he told them, <HI>Did not</HI> John <HI>the Apo|&s;tle &s;ay to the Believers, that they needed no Man to teach them, but as the A|nointing teacheth them?</HI> And tho' they knew this to be Scripture, and that it was true, yet it grieved them, becau&s;e he would not go to hear the Prie&s;t with them, but &s;eparated him&s;elf from their Way of Wor&s;hip: For he &s;aw now, that a true Believer was another Thing than they looked upon it to be; and that being bred at the Univer&s;ities did not qualify a Man to be a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t. Thus he lived by him&s;elf, not joining with any; nay, not of the Di&s;&s;enting People, but became a Stranger to all, relying wholly upon the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Sometime after it was opened in him, <HI>That God, who made the World, did not dwell in Temples made with Hands.</HI> And tho' this &s;eemed at fir&s;t &s;trange to him, becau&s;e both Prie&s;ts and People u&s;ed to call their Churches <HI>Dreadful Places, Holy Ground, and Temples of God,</HI> yet it was immediately &s;hew'd him, that the Lord did not dwell in the&s;e Temples which Man had erected, but in People's Hearts, and that his People were the Temple he dwelt in. This was di&s;cover'd to him when he was walk|ing
<PB N="11" REF="003104_0022_0FEFF2FB54CCFF38">
in the Fields to the Hou&s;e of one of his Relations. And when he came the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, it was told him, that <HI>Nathaniel Stevens,</HI> the Prie&s;t, had been there, and told them, he was afraid of <HI>Fox,</HI> for going after new Lights. This made him &s;mile, becau&s;e now he &s;aw the true State of the Prie&s;ts. But he &s;aid nothing of it to his Relations, who tho' they &s;aw that &s;ome|thing more was requir'd than the vulgar Way of Wor&s;hip, yet they con|tinu d therein, being grieved becau&s;e he would not al&s;o go to hear the Prie&s;ts. Only he told them there was an Anointing in Man, to reach him; and that the Lord would teach his People him&s;elf. He had great Open|ings now concerning the Things written in the Revelations; and when he &s;pake of them, the Prie&s;ts and Profe&s;&s;ors would &s;ay, That was <HI>a &s;ealed up Book.</HI> But to this he &s;aid, <Q>Chri&s;t could open the Seals; and that the Things contain d in that Book, very nearly concern'd us; &s;ince the Epi&s;tles of the Apo&s;tles were written to the Saints of tho&s;e Times, but the Revelations to point at Things to come.</Q> In <HI>England</HI> in tho&s;e Days were People of very odd Notions, and among the re&s;t &s;uch as held, <HI>that Wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n have no Souls.</HI> He lighting on &s;ome of the&s;e, could not for|bear reproving them, &s;ince the Scripture, as he told them plainly, held forth the contrary; for the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> &s;aid, <HI>My Soul doth mag|nify the Lord; and my Spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</HI> He al&s;o came among a People that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly d much on Dreams; but he told them, <Q>Ex|cept they could di&s;tingui&s;h between Dream and Dream, their Ob&s;er|vations would be nothing but Confu&s;ion, &s;ince there were three Sorts of Dreams; for Multiplicity of Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ometimes cau&s;ed Dreams; and there were Whi&s;perings of Satan in the Night-Sea&s;on; and there were al&s;o Speakings o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God to Man in Dreams.</Q> But becau&s;e the&s;e People were more in Want of a clear Di&s;cerning, than of good Will, they at length came out of tho&s;e Imaginations, and at la&s;t became Fellow-Believers with him; who' tho' he had great Openings in his Under&s;tand|ing, yet great Trouble and Temptation many Times came upon him; &s;o that when it was Day, he wi&s;h'd for Night, and when it was Night he wi&s;h'd for Day. Neverthele&s;s, among all tho&s;e Troubles, his Under|&s;tanding was &s;o opened, that he could &s;ay with <HI>David, Day unto Day uttereth Speech, and Night unto Night &s;heweth Knowledge;</HI> for even in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Troubles he had great Openings of many Places in Scripture.</P>
<P>As to State-Affairs, Things continu d in a di&s;tracted Condition; for the King, who after his Army had been beaten, was gone to the <HI>Scots,</HI> was by them delivered up to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> to whom now he could no more pre&s;cribe Laws, but was fain to receive them. And the Church|men were al&s;o at Variance; for the <HI>Independents</HI> (&s;everal of which &s;at al&s;o in Parliament) began to &s;ay, that between Epi&s;copacy, (aga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;t which they had fought conjunctly) and Presbytery, the Difference was only in the Name, and &s;ome few outward Circum&s;tances, &s;ince People of a ten|der Con&s;cience might apprehend no le&s;s Oppre&s;&s;ion from the <HI>Presbyteri|ans,</HI> than from the <HI>Epi&s;copalians:</HI> And that this Fear was not vain or idle, Time afterwards hath &s;hewn abundantly.</P>
<P>But let us return to <HI>George Fox,</HI> who in the Beginning of the Year 1647,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1647 Darby&s;hire.</NOTE> feeling &s;ome Drawings to go into <HI>Darby&s;hire,</HI> went thither, and meeting there with &s;ome Friendly People, had many Di&s;cour&s;es with them. Then pa&s;&s;ing farther into the Peak-Country, he met with more &s;uch People, and al&s;o with &s;ome that were &s;way'd by empty and high Notions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nottingham|&s;hire.</NOTE> And travelling into <HI>Nottingham&s;hire,</HI> there he met with a ten|der People, and among the&s;e one <HI>Elizabeth Hooton,</HI> of which Woman more will be &s;aid in the Sequel: With the&s;e he had &s;ome Meetings and Di&s;cour&s;es. But his Troubles and Temptations &s;till continu'd, and he fa&s;ted much, and walked often abroad in &s;olitary Places, taking his
<PB N="12" REF="003104_0023_0FEFF3423B8FAA58">
Bible with him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1647</NOTE> and then &s;at in hollow Trees, and lone&s;ome Places till Night came on; and frequently in the Night he walked mourn|fully about, being &s;urrounded with many Sorrows in the Times of the&s;e fir&s;t Workings of the Lord in him.</P>
<P>During all this Time he never joined in Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion with any, but gave up him&s;elf to the di&s;po&s;ing of the Lord, having &s;o taken not only all evil Company, but al&s;o taken Leave of Father and Mother, and all other Relations; and &s;o he travelled up and down as a Stranger on the Earth, which Way he felt his Heart inclin'd: And when he came into a Town, he took a Chamber to him&s;elf there, and carried &s;ometimes a Month, &s;ometimes more, &s;ometimes le&s;s in a Place; for he was afraid of &s;taying long in any Place, le&s;t, being a tender young Man, he &s;hould be hurt by too familiar a Conver&s;ation with M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n.</P>
<P>Now tho' it might &s;eem not very agreeable with the Gravity of my Work, to mention what kind of Clothes he wore in the&s;e fir&s;t Years of his Peregrination; yet I don t count it ab&s;urd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay here, that it is in|deed true what a certain Author,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ger. Croes. <HI>Leather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI></NOTE> <HI>viz. Gerrard Croes</HI> relates of him, that he was clothed with Leather; but not, as the &s;aid Author adds, becau&s;e he could not, nor would not, forget his former Leather-Work; but it was partly for the Simplicity of that Dre&s;s, and al&s;o becau&s;e &s;uch a Clothing was &s;trong, and needed but little mending or repairing, which was commodious for him who had no &s;teady Dwelling-Place, and every where in his travelling about fought to live in a lonely State: For keeping him&s;elf thus as a Stranger, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ought heavenly Wi&s;dom, and endeavour'd to get Knowledge of the Lord, and to be weaned from out|ward Things to rely wholly on the Lord alone. Now tho' his Troubles were great, yet they were not &s;o continual, but that he had &s;ome Inter|mi&s;&s;ions, and was &s;ometimes brought into &s;uch an heavenly Joy, that admiring the Love of God to his Soul, he would &s;ay with the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t, Thou, Lord, make&s;t a fruitful Field a barren Wilderne&s;s, and a barren Wilderne&s;s a fruitful Field.</HI> Now he regarded the Prie&s;ts but little, becau&s;e he clearly &s;aw that to be trained up in the Univer&s;ities, and to be in&s;tructed in Languages, liberal Arts, and the like Sciences, was not &s;ufficient to make any one a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel: But he look'd more after the Di&s;&s;enting People: Yet as he had for&s;aken the Prie&s;ts, &s;o he left the &s;epa|rate Preachers al&s;o, becau&s;e he &s;aw there was none among them all that could &s;peak to his Condition. And when all his Hopes in them, and in all Men were gone, then he heard, according to what he relates him&s;elf, a Voice which &s;aid, <HI>There is one, even Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that can &s;peak to thy Condi|tion.</HI> He having heard this, his Heart leapt for Joy; and it was &s;hewed him why there was none upon the Earth that could &s;peak to his Condi|tion, namely, that he might give the Lord alone all the Glory, and that Je&s;us Chri&s;t might have the Pre-eminence. He then experimentally knowing that Chri&s;t enlightens Man, and gives him Grace, Faith, and Power, his De&s;ires after the Lord, and his Zeal in the pure Knowledge of God grew &s;tronger, &s;o that he wi&s;hed to encrea&s;e therein without the Help of any Man, Book, or Writing. Yet he was a diligent Reader of the Holy Scriptures, that &s;peak at large of God and Chri&s;t, tho' he knew him not but by Revelation, as he, who had the Key, did open. Thus he enter'd into no Fellow&s;hip with any Society of People, becau&s;e he &s;aw no|thing but Corruptions every where, which made him endeavour to keep Fellow&s;hip only with Chri&s;t; &s;ince in the greate&s;t Temptations, when he almo&s;t de&s;paired, it was &s;hewed him, that Chri&s;t had been tempted by the &s;ame Devil; but that he had overcome him, and brui&s;ed his Head, and that therefore thro' the Power, Light, Grace, and Spirit of God, he him&s;elf might al&s;o overcome. Thus the Lord a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in the
<PB N="13" REF="003104_0024_0FEFF2FD27C90348">
deepe&s;t Mi&s;eries and Sorrows, and he found his Grace to be &s;ufficient: In&s;omuch that, tho' he had yet &s;ome De&s;ires after the Help of Men, his Thir&s;t was chiefly after the Lord, the Creator of all, and his Son Je&s;us Chi&s;t; becau&s;e nothing could give him any Comfort but the Lord by his Power; and he clearly &s;aw that all the World, tho' he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a King's State, would not have profited him. In this Condition his Under&s;tanding came more and more to be opened, &s;o that he &s;aw how Death in <HI>Adam</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed upon all Men; but that by Chri&s;t, who ta&s;ted Death for all Men, a Deliverance from it and an Entrance into God's Kingdom might be obtain'd. Neverthele&s;s his Temptations continu'd, &s;o that he began to que&s;tion whether he might have &s;inned again&s;t the Ho|ly Gho&s;t. This brought great Perplexity and Trouble over him for ma|ny Days; yet he &s;till gave up him&s;elf to the Lord: And one Day, when he had been walking &s;olitarily abroad, and was come home, he became exceeding &s;en&s;ible of the Love of God to him, &s;o that he could not but admire it. In this Condition it was &s;hew'd him, that all was to be done in and by Chri&s;t; that he conquers and de&s;troys the Tempter, the Devil, and all his Works; and that all the&s;e Troubles and Temptations were good for him for the Trial of his Faith. The Effect of this was, that tho' at Times his Mind was much exerci&s;ed, yet he was &s;tayed by a &s;ecret Belief, and his Soul (by a firm Hope) which was to him as an Anchor, was kept unhurt in the di&s;olute World, &s;wimming above the raging Waves of Temptations. After this (as he relates him&s;elf) there did a pure Fire appear in him; and he &s;aw that the Appearance ot Chri&s;t in the Heart was as a Refiner's Fire, and as the Fuller's Soap; and that a &s;piritual Di&s;cerning was given to him, by which he &s;aw what it was that vail'd his Mind, and what it was that did open it: And that which could not abide in Patience, he found to be of the Fle&s;h, that could not give up to the Will of God, nor yield up it &s;elf to die by the Cro&s;s, <HI>to wit,</HI> the Power of God. On the other hand, he perceived it was the Groans of the Spirit which did open his Under&s;tanding, and that in that Spirit there mu&s;t be a waiting upon God to obtain Redemption.</P>
<P>About this Time he heard of a Woman in <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> that had fa&s;ted twenty two Days; and he went to &s;ee her; but coming there he &s;aw that &s;he was under a Temptation: And after he had &s;poken to her what he felt on his Mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duckenfield<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Manche&s;ter.</NOTE> he left her, and went to <HI>Duckenfield</HI> and <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> where he &s;tay'd a while among the Profe&s;&s;ors he found there, and declared to them that Doctrine which now he firmly believed to be Truth; and &s;ome were convinced, &s;o as to receive the inward divine Teaching of the Lord, and take that for their Rule. This, by what I can find, was the fir&s;t Beginning of <HI>George Fox</HI>'s Preaching,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F</HI>'s fir&s;t Preaching.</NOTE> which, as I have been credibly informed, in tho&s;e early Years chiefly con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ome few, but power|ful and piercing Words, to tho&s;e whole Hearts were already in &s;ome mea|&s;ure prepared to be capable of receiving this Doctrine. And it &s;eems to me that the&s;e People, and al&s;o <HI>Elizabeth Hooton,</HI> (already mention'd) have been the fir&s;t who by &s;uch a mean or weak Preaching came to be his Fel|low-Believers: Tho' there have been al&s;o &s;ome others who by the like immediate Way, as <HI>George Fox</HI> him&s;elf, have been convinced in their Minds, and came to &s;ee that they ought diligently to take Heed to the Teachings of the Grace of God that hath appeared to them.

<P>But to return again to <HI>George Fox:</HI> It &s;et the Profe&s;&s;ors of tho&s;e Times in a Rage, that &s;ome of their Adhe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ents hearkened to his Preaching; for they could not endure to hear Perfection &s;poke of, and of a holy and &s;in|le&s;s

Life, as a State that could be obtained here. Not long after he travelled to <HI>Broughton</HI> in <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> and went there into a Meeting of the <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> where &s;ome People of other Notions al&s;o came. This gave him Occa&s;ion to preach the Doctrine of Truth among them, and that not in vain; for &s;ince he had great Openings in the Scriptures, and that a &s;pecial Power of the Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Workings began to &s;pring in tho&s;e Parts, &s;everal were &s;o reach'd in their Minds, that they came to be con|vinced, and were turned from Darkne&s;s to Light, partly by his Preach|ing, and partly by rea&s;oning with &s;ome. Yet he him&s;elf was &s;till &s;ome|times under great Temptations, without finding any to open his Condi|tion to, but the Lord alone, unto whom he cried Night and Day for Help. Some time after he went back into <HI>Nottingham&s;hire,</HI> and there it plea&s;ed the Lord to &s;hew him, that the Natures of tho&s;e Things which were hurtful without, were al&s;o within in the Minds of wicked Men; and that the Natures of Dogs, Swine, Vipers, and tho&s;e of <HI>Cain I&s;hmael, I &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Pharaoh,</HI> &amp;c. were in the Hearts of many People. But &s;ince this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d grieve him, he cry'd to the Lord, &s;aying, <HI>Why &s;hould I be thus, &s;eeing I was never addicted to commit tho&s;e Evils!</HI> And inwardly it was an&s;wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d him, <HI>That it was needful he &s;hould have a Sen&s;e of all Conditions; how el&s;e &s;hould he &s;peak to all Conditions?</HI> He al&s;o &s;aw there was an Ocean of Dark|ne&s;s and Death; but withal an infinite Ocean of Light and Love, which flowed over the Ocean of Darkne&s;s; in all which he perceived the infi|nite Love of God. About that Time it happened that he walking in the Town of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> by the Steeple-hou&s;e Side, it was inwardly told him, <HI>That which People trample upon mu&s;t be thy Food;</HI> and at the &s;aying of this, it was opened to him, that it was the Life of Chri&s;t People did trample upon; and that they fed one another with Words, without mind|ing that thereby the Blood of the Son of God was trampled under Foot. And tho' it &s;eemed at fir&s;t &s;trange to him, that he &s;hould feed on that which the high Profe&s;&s;ors trampled upon, yet it was clearly open|ed to him how this could be.</P>
<P>Then many People came far and near to &s;ee him; and tho' he &s;poke &s;ometimes, to open religious Matters to them, yet he was fearful of being drawn out by them. Now the Rea&s;on of People thus ftocking to him might proceed partly from this: There was one <HI>Brown,</HI> who up|on his Death-Bed &s;poke by way of Prophecy many notable Things con|cerning <HI>George Fox,</HI> and among the re&s;t, <HI>that he &s;hould be made in&s;trumen|tal by the Lord to the Conver&s;ion of People.</HI> And of others that then were &s;omething in Shew, he &s;aid, <HI>That they &s;hould come to nothing.</HI> Which was fulfilled in Time, tho' this Man did not live to &s;ee it, for he was not rai&s;ed from his Sickne&s;s But after he was buried, <HI>George Fox</HI> fell in|to &s;uch a Condition, that he not only look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> like a dead Body, but unto many that came to &s;ee him he &s;eemed as if he had been dead really: And many vi&s;ited him for about fourteen Days Time, who wondered to &s;ee him &s;o much alter'd in Countenance. But at length his Sorrows and Troubles began to wear off, and Tears of Joy dropped from him, &s;o that he could have wept Night and Day with Tears of Joy in Bro|kenne&s;s of Heart. And to give an Account of his Condition to tho&s;e that are able to comprehend it, I'll give his own Words. <HI>I &s;aw</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>into that which was without End, and Things which cannot be uttered, and of the Greatne&s;s and Infinitene&s;s of the Love of God, which cannot be expre&s;s'd by Words: For I had been brought thro' the very Ocean of Darkne&s;s and Death, and thro' and over the Power of Satan, by the eternal glorius Power of Chri&s;t: Even thro' that Darkne&s;s, was I brought which covered all the World, and which chained down all, and &s;hut up all in the Death. And the &s;ame eternal Power of God, which brought me thro' tho&s;e Things, was that which afterwards

&s;hook the Nation, Prie&s;ts, Profe&s;&s;ors, and People. Then could I &s;ay, I had been in Spiritual</HI> Babylon, Sodom, Egypt, <HI>and the Grave; but by the eter|nal Power of God I was come out of it, and was brought over it, and the Power of it, into the Power of Chri&s;t. And I &s;aw the Harve&s;t white, and the Seed of God lying thick in the Ground, as ever did Wheat, that was &s;own outwardly, and none to gather it: And for this I mourned with Tears.</HI> Thus far <HI>George Fox</HI>'s own Words, of whom now a Report went abroad, <HI>That he was a young Man that had a Di&s;cerning Spirit:</HI> Whereupon many Profe&s;&s;ors, Prie&s;ts, and People came to him, and his Mini&s;try encrea&s;ed; for he having received great Openings, &s;poke to them of the Things of God, and was heard with Attention by many, who going away, &s;pread the Fame thereof. Then came the Tempter, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et upon him again, charging him that he had &s;inned again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t; but he could not tell in what; and then <HI>Paul</HI>'s Condition came before him, how after he had been taken up into the third Heavens, and &s;een Things not law|ful to be uttered, a Me&s;&s;enger of Satan was &s;ent to buffet him, that he might not exalt him&s;elf. Thus <HI>George Fox,</HI> by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Lord, got al&s;o over that Temptation. Now the 47th Year of that Cen|tury drew to an End; and State-Affairs in <HI>England</HI> grew more and more clouded and intricate; for the King not thinking him&s;elf any longer &s;afe at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> whither he had been brought from the Army, he withdrew to the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI> whil&s;t the Parliament &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on the Abrogation of Epi&s;copacy, and would be Ma&s;ter of the Military For|ces: Which the King not being willing to yield to, was now kept in clo&s;er Cu&s;tody, and no more regarded as a Sovereign, to whom Obedi|ence was due from the Parliament.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e inte&s;tine Troubles the Minds of many People came to be fitted to receive a nearer Way and Doctrine of Godline&s;s; and it was in the Year 1648,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1648</NOTE> that &s;everal Per&s;ons &s;eeking the Lord were become Fellow-Believers, and entred into Society with <HI>George Fox;</HI> in&s;omuch that they began to have great Meetings in <HI>Nottingham&s;hire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nottingham|&s;hire.</NOTE> which were vi&s;ited by many. About that Time there was a Meeting of Prie&s;ts and Profe&s;&s;ors at a Ju&s;tice's Hou&s;e, and <HI>George Fox</HI> went among them, and heard them di&s;cour&s;e concerning what the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid, <HI>He had not known Sin but by the Law, which &s;aid, Thou &s;halt not lu&s;t.</HI> And &s;ince they held that to be &s;poken of the outward Law, <HI>George Fox</HI> told them, <Q><HI>Paul</HI> &s;poke that after he was convinc'd; for he had the outward Law before, and was bred up in it, when he was in the Lu&s;t of Per|&s;ecution; but it was the Law of God in his Mind, which he &s;erved, and which the Law in his Members warred again&s;t.</Q> This Saying found &s;o much Entrance, that tho&s;e of the Prie&s;ts and Profe&s;&s;ors that were mo&s;t moderate, yielded, and con&s;ented, that it was not the out|ward Law, but the Inward, that &s;hewed the inward Lu&s;t, which the Apo&s;tle &s;pake of. After this he went again to <HI>Mansfield,</HI> where was a great Meeting of Profe&s;&s;ors and other People; and being among them, and moved to pray, &s;uch an extraordinary Power appeared, and &s;eized on the Hearts of &s;ome in &s;o eminent a Manner, that even the House &s;eem'd to be &s;haken: And after Prayer, &s;ome of the Auditory began to &s;ay, that This re&s;embled that in the Days of the Apo&s;tles, when on the Day of <HI>Penteco&s;t,</HI> the Hou&s;e where they were met was &s;haken.</P>
<P>Not long after this, there was another great Meeting of Profe&s;&s;ors, where <HI>G.

thinking that it was to be felt inwardly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1648</NOTE> But a certain Captain, who&s;e Name was <HI>Amos Stoddard,</HI> was &s;o reached, that &s;eeing how they endea|vour'd to bear <HI>G.

And pa&s;&s;ing thence into <HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> he met with a great Company of Profe&s;&s;ors, who being come together in the Field, were praying and expounding the Scriptures. Here the Bible was given him, which he opened on the 5th of <HI>Matthew,</HI> where Chri&s;t expounded &s;ome Parts of the Law; from whence <HI>G. Fox</HI> took Occa&s;ion to open to them the inward and out|ward State of Man. And that which he held forth getting &s;ome Ground, they fell into a fierce Contention among them&s;elves, and &s;o parted.</P>
<P>Then he heard of a great Meeting to be at <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> for a Di&s;pute, wherein tho&s;e of &s;everal Per&s;uations, as <HI>Presbyterians, Independents, Bap|ti&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Epi&s;copalians</HI> were &s;aid to be all concern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d. This Meeting being appointed to be in the Steeple-hou&s;e, he went thither, where Abun|dance of People were met, &s;ome of tho&s;e that &s;poke being in Pews, and the Prie&s;t in the Pulpit. At la&s;t after &s;everal Rea&s;onings, a Woman &s;tarted a Que&s;tion, and asked, <HI>What that Birth was the Apo&s;tle</HI> Peter <HI>&s;poke of;</HI> viz. <HI>a being born again of incorruptible Seed, by the Word of God, that li|veth and abideth for ever?</HI> The Prie&s;t, in&s;tead of an&s;wering this Que&s;ti|on, &s;aid to her, <HI>I permit not a Woman to &s;peak in the Church,</HI> tho' he had before given Liberty for any to &s;peak. This kindled <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Zeal, &s;o that he &s;tept up and ask'd the Prie&s;t, <HI>Do&s;t thou call this Place</HI> (the Steeple-hou&s;e) <HI>a Church? Or do&s;t thou call this mixt Multitude a Church?</HI> But the Prie&s;t not an&s;wering to this, asked <HI>What a Church was?</HI> And <HI>G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>The Church was the Pillar and Ground of Truth, made up of Li|ving Stones, Living Members, a Spiritual Hou&s;hold, which Chri&s;t was the Head of: But he was not the Head of a mixt Multitude, or of an old Hou&s;e, made up of Lime, Stones, and Wood.</HI> This cau&s;ed &s;uch a Stir, that the Prie&s;t came down out of his Pulpit, and others out of their Pews, where|by the Di&s;pute was marr'd. But <HI>G. Fox</HI> went to a great Inn, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e di&s;puted with the Prie&s;ts and Profe&s;&s;ors of all Sorts, maintaining what he had &s;aid, till they all went away; yet &s;everal were convinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d that Day, and among the&s;e the Woman who asked the Que&s;tion afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>After this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nottingham|&s;hire.</NOTE> <HI>G. Fox</HI> return'd again into <HI>Nottingam&s;hire,</HI> and went into the Vale of <HI>Beavor,</HI> where he preach'd Repentance to the People: And he &s;taying &s;ome Weeks there, and pa&s;&s;ing thro' &s;everal Towns, many were convinced of the Truth of his Doctrine. About that Time, as he was &s;itting by the Fire one Morning, a Cloud came over him, and a Temp|tation be&s;et him; and he &s;itting &s;till, it was &s;ugge&s;ted, <HI>All Things come by Nature;</HI> and he was in a Manner quite clouded; but he continuing to &s;it &s;till, the People of the Hou&s;e perceived nothing: At length a living Hope aro&s;e in him, and al&s;o a Voice, that &s;aid, <HI>There is a living God, who made all Things;</HI> and immediately the Cloud and Temptation vani&s;hed away, whereby his Heart was made glad, and he prai&s;ed the Lord.</P>
<P>Not long after, he met with &s;ome People that had a mi&s;chievous No|tion, <HI>That there was no God, but that all Things came by Nature.</HI> But he rea&s;oning with them, &s;o confounded them, that &s;ome were fain to confe&s;s that there was a living God.

many were gathered. Then coming into <HI>Darly&s;hire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Darly&s;hire. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.ton. Mansfield.</NOTE> there was a great Meeting of his Friends at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on,</HI> where many of them began to preach the Doctrine of Truth, who afterwards were moved to declare the Truth in other Places al&s;o. <HI>G. Fox</HI> coming about this Time to <HI>Mansfield,</HI> heard that in a Town about eight Miles off, there was to be a Sitting of Ju&s;ti|ces, to deliberate about hiring of Servants; and he, feeling a Con&s;traint upon his Mind, went thither, and exhorted them, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot to oppre&s;s the Ser|vants in their Wages, but to do that which was right and ju&s;t to them:</HI> And the Ser|vants, many of which were come there, he admoni&s;hed <HI>To do their Duty, and &s;erve hone&s;tly:</HI> And they all received his Exhortation kindly. He felt him&s;elf al&s;o moved to go to &s;everal Courts and Steeple-hou&s;es at <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and other Places, warning them to leave on Oppre&s;&s;ion, Deceit and other Evils. And having heard at <HI>Mansfield</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one in the Country, who was a common Drankard and a noted Whore-ma&s;ter, and a Poet al&s;o, he went to him, and reproved him in an awful Manner for his evil Cour&s;es; which &s;o &s;truck him, that coming afterwards to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> he told him, <HI>That he was &s;o &s;mitten when he &s;poke to him, that he had &s;carce any Strength left in him.</HI> And this Man was &s;o thoroughly convinced, that he turned from his Wickedne&s;s, and became an hone&s;t &s;ober Man, to the A&s;toni&s;hment of tho&s;e that knew him before. Thus the Work of <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Mini&s;try went forward, and many were thereby turn'd from Darkne&s;s to Light; and divers Meetings of his Friends, who were much increa&s;ed in Number &s;ince the Year 1646, were now &s;et up in &s;eve|ral Places. Now <HI>G. Fox</HI> was come up to quite another State than for|merly he had lived in; for he knew now not only a Renewing of the Heart, and a Re&s;toration of the Mind, but the Virtues of the Crea|tures were al&s;o open'd to him; &s;o that he began to deliberate whether he &s;hould practi&s;e Phy&s;ick for the Good of Mankind. But God had another Service for him; and it was &s;hewed him that he was to enter into a Spiritual Labour; and al&s;o that tho&s;e who continu'd faithful to the Lord, might attain to a State in which the &s;inful Inclination was &s;ub|du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d. Moreover the three great Profe&s;&s;ions in the World, <HI>viz.</HI> Phy|&s;ick, Divinity, (&s;o called) and Law, were opened to him, whereby he &s;aw that the Phy&s;icians wanting the Wi&s;dom of God, by whicn the Creatures were made, knew not their Virtues: That the Lawyers gene|ral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y were void of Equity and Ju&s;tice, and &s;o out of the Law of God, which went over the fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and over all Sin, and an&s;wered the Spirit of God that was oppre&s;&s;ed in Man: And that the Prie&s;ts, for the mo&s;t Part, were out of the true Faith, which Chri&s;t is the Author of, and which purifies the Heart, and brings Man to have Acce&s;s to God. So that the&s;e Phy&s;icians, Lawyers, and Prie&s;ts, who pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ended to cure the Body, to e&s;tabli&s;h the Property of the People, and to cure the Soul, were all without the true Knowledge and Wi&s;dom they ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s. Yet he felt there was a Divine Power, by which all might be reformed, if they would receive, and bow unto it. And he &s;aw al&s;o, that tho' the Prie&s;ts did err, yet they were not the greate&s;t Deceivers &s;poken of in the Scriptures; but that the&s;e great Deceivers were &s;uch, who, as <HI>Cain,</HI> had heard the Voice of God, and who, as <HI>Corah, Dathan,</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> and their Company, were come out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and thro' the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and had prai&s;ed God on the Banks of the Sea-&s;hore; and who being come as far as <HI>Balaam,</HI> could &s;peak the Word of the Lord, as having heard his Voice, and known his Spirit, &s;o that they could &s;ee the Star of <HI>Jacob,</HI> and the Goodline&s;s of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s Tents, which no Enchantment could pre|vail again&s;t: The&s;e that could &s;peak &s;o much of their Divine Experi|ence, and yet turn'd from the Spirit of God, and went into the Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n|&s;aying, the&s;e he &s;aw would be great Deceivers, far beyond the Prie&s;ts.
<PB N="18" REF="003104_0029_0FEFF3491E026F20">
He &s;aw al&s;o that People generally did read the Scriptures, without ha|ving a true Sen&s;e of them; for &s;ome cry'd out much again&s;t <HI>Cain, I&s;h|mael, E&s;au, Corah, Balaam, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> &amp;c. not regarding that the Nature of the&s;e was yet alive in them&s;elves; whereby they always apply'd to o|thers that Nature in which they them&s;elves lived.</P>
<P>The Lord had al&s;o opened to him now, that <HI>Every Man was enlighten|ed by the Divine Light of Chri&s;t;</HI> and he &s;aw that they that believed in it, came out of Condemnation, and became the Children of the Light: But they that hated it, and did not believe in it, were condemn'd by it, tho' they made a Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t. All this he &s;aw in the pure Openings of the Light. He al&s;o &s;aw that God had afforded a Mea&s;ure of his Spirit to all Men, and that thereby they could truly come to &s;erve the Lord, and to worship him; and that his Grace, which brings Salvation, and had appeared to all Men, was able to bring them into the Favour of God.</P>
<P>And on a certain Time, as he was walking in the Fields, he under|&s;tood that it was &s;aid to him <HI>Thy Name is witten in the Lamb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Book of Life, which was before the Foundation of the World.</HI> This he took to be the Voice of the Lord, and believed it to be true. Then he felt him&s;elf powerfully moved to go abroad into the World, which was like a briery thorny Wilderne&s;s; and he found then that the World &s;welled again&s;t him, and made a Noi&s;e like the great raging Waves of the Sea. For when he came to proclaim the Day of the Lord among&s;t the Prie&s;ts, Profe&s;&s;ors, Magi&s;trates, and People, they were all like a di&s;turbed Sea. Now he was &s;ent to turn People from Darkne&s;s to the Light, that they might receive Chri&s;t Je&s;us; for he &s;aw, that to as many as &s;hould re|ceive him in his Light, he would give Power to become the Sons of God: And that therefore he was to turn People to the Grace of God, and to the Truth in the Heart; and that by this Grace they might be taught, and thereby obtain Salvation; &s;ince Chri&s;t had died for all Men, and was a Propitiation for all, having enlightned all Men with his Divine and Saving Light, and the Manife&s;tation of the Spirit of God being given to every Man to profit withal.

And being unwilling to an&s;wer to the Charge, he was on the 27th of the Month call'd <HI>January</HI> &s;entenced to Death, as a Tyrant, Traytor, Murder|er, and a publick Enemy to the Common-wealth.

He al&s;o te&s;tified again&s;t Wakes, May-games, Plays, and Shews, by which People were led into Vanity, and drawn off from the Fear of God; the Days that were &s;et forth for Holy-days, being u&s;ually the Times wherein God was mo&s;t di&s;honoured. When he came in Markets, he al&s;o declared again&s;t de|ceitful Merchandizing, and warned all to deal ju&s;tly, and to &s;peak the Truth; and he te&s;tified again&s;t the Mountebanks playing Tricks on their Stages: And when Occa&s;ion offer'd, he warned the School-ma&s;ters and School-mi&s;tre&s;&s;es to teach their Children to mind the Fear of the Lord; &s;aying, that they them&s;elves ought to be Examples and Patterns of Vertue to them. But very burden&s;ome it was to him, when he heard the Bell ring to call People together to the Steeple-hou&s;e; for it &s;eemed to him ju&s;t like a Market-Bell, to gather the People, that the Prie&s;t might &s;et forth his Ware to Sale.

<P>Concerning State-Affairs it hath been &s;aid already, that <HI>Charles</HI> II. had been proclaimed King by the <HI>Scots;</HI> but he being &s;till in <HI>Holland,</HI> they &s;ent to him there, that he would &s;ub&s;cribe the Covenant, and &s;o abro|gate Epi&s;copacy in <HI>Scotland:</HI> It was al&s;o de&s;ired that he would put &s;ome Lords from him.

<P>He having been &s;ent away, as hath been &s;aid, from <HI>Che&s;terfield,</HI> came to <HI>Darby</HI> in the year 1650,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Darby 1650</NOTE> and lay at a Doctor's Hou&s;e, who&s;e Wife was convinced of the Truth he preached.

of the Officers of the Army, and Prie&s;ts and Preachers were to be there, as al&s;o a Colonel that was a Preacher. Then he felt him&s;elf moved to go to that Congregation; and when the Service was done, he &s;poke to them what he believed the Lord required of him, and they were pretty quiet. But there came an Officer, who took him by the Hand, and &s;aid, that he, and the other two that were with him, mu&s;t go before the Magi&s;trates. He then coming about the fir&s;t Hour in the Afternoon, before them, they asked him, <HI>Why he came thither?</HI> To which having an&s;wer'd, <HI>That God had moved him to it;</HI> he farther &s;aid, that <HI>God did not dwell in Temples made with Hands; and that all their Preaching, Bapti&s;m, and Sacrifices would never &s;anctify them; but that they ought to look unto Chri&s;t in them, and not unto Men; becau&s;e it is Chri&s;t that &s;anctifies.</HI> They then running into many Words, he told them, <HI>They were not to di&s;pute of God and Chri&s;t, but to obey him.</HI> But this Doctrine did &s;o di&s;plea&s;e them, that they often put him in and out of the Room, and &s;ometimes told him &s;coffingly, <HI>That he was taken up in Raptures.</HI> At la&s;t they asked him, <HI>Whether he was &s;anctified?</HI> And he an&s;wering, <HI>Yes,</HI> they then asked, <HI>If he had no Sin?</HI> To which he &s;aid, <HI>Chri&s;t my Saviour has taken away my Sin, and in him there is no Sin.</HI> Then he and his Friends were asked, <HI>How they knew that Chri&s;t did abide in them?</HI> And <HI>G.

who &s;ign'd the afore&s;aid <HI>Mittimus,</HI> and an <HI>Independent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1650</NOTE> hearing that <HI>G. Fox</HI> bad him, and tho&s;e about him, <HI>Tremble at the Word of the Lord!</HI> took hold of this weighty Saying with &s;uch an airy Mind, that from thence he took Occa&s;ion to call him, and his Friends, &s;cornfully, <HI>Q&V;A|KERS.</HI> This new and unu&s;ual Denomination was taken up &s;o eagerly, and &s;pread &s;o among the People, that not only the Prie&s;ts there from that Time gave no other Name to the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Light, but &s;ounded it &s;o gladly abroad, that it &s;oon ran over all <HI>England;</HI> and ma|king no Stand there, it quickly reach'd to the neighbouring Countries, and adjacent Kingdoms, in&s;omuch, that the &s;aid Profe&s;&s;ors of the Light, for Di&s;tinction's-Sake from other religious Societies, have been called every where by that <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Name, which &s;ounding very odd in the Ears of &s;ome foreign Nations, hath al&s;o given Occa&s;ion to many &s;illy Stories.</P>
<P>Now becau&s;e in tho&s;e early Times, among the many Adherents of this Per&s;ua&s;ion, were al&s;o &s;ome that having been People of a rude and di&s;&s;o|lute Life, came &s;o to be prick'd to the Heart, that they grew true Peni|tents, with real Sorrow for their former Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; it happen'd that not only they at Meetings did bur&s;t out into Tears, but al&s;o were affected with &s;uch a &s;ingular Commotion of the Mind, that &s;ome Shakings of their Bodies were perceived; &s;ome People naturally being more affected with the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind, than others; for even Anger doth tran&s;|port &s;ome Men &s;o violently, that it makes them tremble; whereas o|thers will quake with Fear: And what Wonder then, if &s;ome being &s;truck with the Terrors of God did tremble? But this being &s;een by envious Men, they took Occa&s;ion from thence to tell, that the&s;e Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the Light performed their Wor&s;hip with Shaking; yet they them&s;elves never a&s;&s;erted that Trembling of the Body was an e&s;&s;ential Part of their Religion, but have occa&s;ionally &s;aid the contrary; tho' they did not deny them&s;elves to be &s;uch as trembled before God; and they al&s;o did not &s;tick to &s;ay, that all People ought to do &s;o; however thereby not enjoining a bodily Shaking.</P>
<P>We have &s;een ju&s;t now, how one <HI>Fretwell</HI> was committed with <HI>G. Fox</HI> to the Hou&s;e of Correction; but he not &s;tanding faithful in his Te&s;timo|ny, obtained, by Interce&s;&s;ion of the Jailor, Leave of the Ju&s;tice to go &s;ee his Mother, and &s;o got his Liberty; and then a Report was &s;pread, that he had &s;aid, <HI>That</HI> G. Fox <HI>had bewitched and deceived him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> was now become the Object of many People's Hatred; Magi|&s;trates, Prie&s;ts, and Profe&s;&s;ors were all in a Rage again&s;t him; and the Jailor, to find &s;omething wherewithal to en&s;nare him, would &s;ometimes ask him &s;uch &s;illy Que&s;tions, as, <HI>Whether the Door was latch'd, or not?</HI> thinking thereby to draw &s;ome &s;udden unadvi&s;ed An&s;wer from him where|by he might charge Sin upon him: But he was kept &s;o watchful and cir|cum&s;pect, that they could get no Advantage of him. Not long after his Commitment, he was moved to write both to the Prie&s;ts and Magi&s;trates of <HI>Darby.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ger. Croe&s;e</NOTE> Now &s;ince <HI>Ger. Croe&s;e</HI> in the Beginning of his Hi&s;tory repre|&s;ents <HI>G. Fox</HI> as one altogether unfit, not only to write legibly, but al&s;o to expre&s;s his Mind clearly in Writing, and that therefore he always was oblig'd to employ others that could &s;et down his Meaning intelligibly, it won't be be&s;ides the Purpo&s;e to &s;ay, that this is more than any ever will be able to prove. For tho' it can't be denied, that he was no elegant Writer, nor good Speller, yet it is true, that his Characters being tolera|ble, his Writing was legible, and the Matter he treated was intelligible, tho' his Stile was not like that of a skilful Lingui&s;t. And albeit he em|ploy'd others, becau&s;e him&s;elf was no quick Writer, yet generally they were young Lads, who as they dur&s;t not have attempted to alter his Words and Phra&s;es, &s;o they would not have been skilful enough to re|fine

<P>Now the Keeper of the Pri&s;on, who was al&s;o an high Profe&s;&s;or, was much enrag'd again&s;t <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and &s;poke wickedly of him.

G. Fox</HI> unwilling to deny his De&s;ire, comply'd with it, and &s;uffered him to lie with him. Then the Keeper told him all his Heart, and &s;aid, <HI>He believed what he had &s;aid of the true Faith and Hope, to be true:</HI> And he wondered that the other Man that was put into Pri&s;on with him, did not &s;tand to it; for, &s;aid he, <HI>That Man was not right, but you are an hone&s;t Man.</HI> He al&s;o confe&s;&s;ed, that at tho&s;e Times when <HI>G.

But he &s;ignified to him that he had no Mind to get his Liberty that Way &mdash; And &s;o he remained Pri&s;oner, and was vi&s;ited by the Jailor's Si&s;ter, who was &s;o affected with what he &s;poke to her, that the coming down, told her Brother, <HI>They were an innocent People, that did no Hurt to any, but Good to all;</HI> and &s;he de&s;ired that he might be treated civilly.</P>

<P>THE Year 1651 had &s;carce begun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1651</NOTE> when the <HI>Scots</HI> re&s;olved, not|with&s;tanding their Overthrow, to crown their new King, which, after he had &s;worn to maintain the Covenant, they did in the Beginning of the Month called <HI>January.</HI> But we leaving this&punc; return again to <HI>G.

Go to him for Direction. G.

He al&s;o &s;aid, <HI>His Colonel</HI> (which I take to be <HI>Barton) was as blind as</HI> Nebuchadnezzar, <HI>to ca&s;t the Servant of the Lord into Pri&s;on.</HI> This &s;o incens'd his Colonel, that, when at the <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> Fight, the two Armies lying near one another, two from the King's Army challenged any two of the Parliament's Army to fight with them, the &s;aid Colonel made Choice of him and another to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;wer the Challenge: And when in the Encounter his Companion was &s;lain, he drove both his Enemies within a Musket-&s;hot of the Town, without firing a Pi&s;tol at them.

<P>Now the Time of <HI>G.

Fox</HI> asked him, <HI>Whether there were not</HI> Jews, <HI>Chief Prie&s;ts, and</HI> Pilate <HI>outwardly?</HI> This puzzled the Soldier a little, &s;o that he could not deny it. Then he told him, <HI>As certainly as there was a Chief Prie&s;t, and</HI> Jews, <HI>and</HI> Pilate, <HI>&s;o certainly Chri&s;t did &s;uffer there outwardly under them.</HI> Yet this incon&s;ide|rate Per&s;on al&s;o &s;aid, <HI>That never any of the Prophets, or Apo&s;tles, or Holy Men of God, &s;uffered any Thing outwardly; but that all their Sufferings were inward.</HI> Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> in&s;tanced to him many of the Prophets and Apo|&s;tles, how they &s;uffered, and by whom they &s;uffered, thereby to con|found his &s;illy Imaginations. Yet &s;uch was the Malice of &s;ome, that a Slander was rai&s;ed among the People, <HI>That the</HI> Quakers <HI>denied Chri&s;t that &s;uffered and died at</HI> Jeru&s;alem. This, indeed, is a &s;ingular Evidence of the Credu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ity of People, taking upon Tru&s;t any Story, how fal&s;e &s;o|ever, when it relates to tho&s;e that are become the Object ot vulgar Odium. Now as <HI>G. Fox</HI> was often vi&s;ited by tho&s;e that came out of Curio&s;ity, it is not to be wondered, that &s;ometimes he was contradicted by pre&s;ump|tuous and &s;elf-concei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed Per&s;ons. Once there came to him &s;ome that pretended they were Triers of Spirits;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Triers of Spi|rits.</NOTE> and the&s;e he asked, <HI>What was the fir&s;t Step to Peace? And what it was by which a Man might &s;ee his Salva|tion?</HI> But they being or an airy Mind, took this to be &s;uch a &s;trange Que&s;tion, that they did not &s;tick to &s;ay, <HI>He was mad.</HI> Thus it appear|ed, that the&s;e who pretended to try Spirits, did not know what Spi|rit they them&s;elves were of, and that they had not &s;ufficient Know|ledge to make a good Judgment of the Corporal Con&s;titution, &s;aying he was mad, who was in no wi&s;e out of his Sen&s;es.</P>
<P>In the Time of his Impri&s;onment he was much exerci&s;ed in Mind about the Proceedings of the Magi&s;trates, becau&s;e Men were put to Death for &s;tealing of Cattle, Money, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and he was the more troubled about it, becau&s;e this Practice was contrary to the Law of God in old Time. Wherefore he writ the following two Letters to the Judges.</P>
<P><Q>I AM moved to write unto you to take Heed of putting Men to <HI>Death</HI> for &s;tealing <HI>Cattel,</HI> or <HI>Money,</HI> &amp;c. for the <HI>Theives</HI> in the old

<P>Whil&s;t <HI>G. Fox</HI> was in Pri&s;on among the Felons, it grieved him to hear their foul Language; and he often reproved them for their wicked Words, and evil Carriage towards each other; and People did admire that he was &s;o pre&s;erv'd among this bad Company, without being de|filed by their Conver&s;ation: But the Fear of God &s;o prevailed in his Heart, that he could not be charged with any evil Word or Action all the Time he was there: Yet he perceived that it was dangerous to con|ver&s;e with &s;uch a naughty Crew, and therefore he laid before the Judges what an hurtful Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng it was, that Pri&s;oners &s;hould lie long in Jail, becau&s;e they learned Wickedne&s;s one of another, in talking of their bad Deeds; and that therefore &s;peedy Ju&s;tice ought to be done.</P>
<P>Now whil&s;t he was confined here, there was a young Woman in the Jail for robbing her Ma&s;ter of &s;ome Money; and &s;he being to be tried for her Life, he wrote concerning her to the Judge and Jury, &s;hewing them, how contrary it was to the Law of God of old, to put People to Death for Stealing; and that it was an incumbent Duty to &s;hew Mer|cy. But notwith&s;tanding his Writing &s;o, &s;he was condemned to die, and a Grave was made for her. <HI>G. Fox</HI> having heard this, writ a few Words, containing, <Q>A Warning for all People to beware of Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear the Lord, and prize their Time, while they have it; that &s;o they might avoid Wickedne&s;s.</Q> And when the Woman, at the Time appointed, was carried forth to Execution, he gave this Writing to be read at the Gallows; but when &s;he was upon the Ladder, with a Cloth over her Face, and ready to be turned off, &s;he was reprieved, and was brought back again to Pri&s;on, where afterwards &s;he came to be convin|ced of the Truth, as held forth by <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and his Friends.</P>
<P>In the Jail there was al&s;o detained a wicked Man, who was &s;aid to be a Conjurer; this Man threatned <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and al&s;o the Jailor, <HI>That he would rai&s;e the Devil, and break the Hou&s;e down;</HI> &s;o that he made the

Jailor afraid. But <HI>G.

<P>Now the Ju&s;tices to get rid of <HI>G. Fox,</HI> re&s;olved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pre&s;s him for a Soldier, &s;eeing he would not voluntarily accept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mand; and <HI>Bennet</HI> &s;ent Con&s;tables to give him Pre&s;s-Money: But he told them, <HI>That he was brought off from outward War, and was dead to it.</HI> And tho' the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners over and again profered him Money, yet he would not take it; at which they grew &s;o angry, that he was committed clo&s;e Pri&s;o|ner. Hereupon <HI>G. Fox</HI> wrote to the Ju&s;tices, and tho&s;e that were con|cerned in his Commitment, the following Lines.</P>

Fox,</HI> and they both went to the Steeple-hou&s;e, where <HI>G. Fox,</HI> when the Prie&s;t had done, &s;poke to both Prie&s;t and People, and directed them where they might find their Teacher, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> inwardly, in their Hearts; which was of &s;uch Effect, that &s;ome received that Doctrine of Truth, and continued in it. In the Afternoon he went to another Steeple-hou&s;e, about three Miles off, where one preached that bore the Title of <HI>Doctor:</HI> He took his Text from <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> LV. <HI>Every one that thir&s;t|eth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money, come ye, buy and eat, yea come, buy Wine and Milk, without Money, without Price.

to preach, Freely ye have received, freely give?</HI> The Prie&s;t being amazed, ha&s;tened away, and &s;o gave <HI>G.

<P>Having thus cleared him&s;elf among&s;t that People, he return'd to Ju&s;tice <HI>Hotham</HI>'s Hou&s;e that Night, who embracing him, &s;aid, <HI>My Hou&s;e is your Hou&s;e;</HI> and al&s;o &s;ignified, <HI>that he was exceeding glad at the Work of the Lord, and that his Power was revealed.</HI></P>
<P>From thence <HI>G. Fox</HI> went thro' the Country, and came at Night to an Inn, where he bid the Woman of the Hou&s;e, if &s;he had any Meat, to bring him &s;ome. But becau&s;e he &s;aid <HI>Thee</HI> and <HI>Thou</HI> to her, &s;he look|ed &s;trangely on him. Then he asked her, if &s;he had any Milk? and &s;he &s;aid, <HI>No:</HI> He believing &s;he &s;poke fal&s;ely, and &s;eeing a Churn &s;tand in the Room, would try her farther, and asked h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, <HI>If &s;he had any Cream?</HI> But &s;he denied that &s;he had any. Then a little Boy playing about the Churn, put his Hands into it, and pulling it down, threw all the Cream on the Floor. Thus the Woman appeared to be a Lyar, and &s;he being amazed, took up the Child, and whipt it &s;orely: But he reproved her for her Lying, and going out of the Hou&s;e, went away, and that Night lay in a
Stack of Hay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">York.</NOTE> in Rain and Snow. The next Day he came to <HI>York;</HI> and the fir&s;t Day of the Week being come, he went to the Cathedral: When the Prie&s;t had done, he &s;aid, <HI>He had &s;omething from the Lord God to &s;peak to the Prie&s;t and People.</HI> Then &s;aid a Profe&s;&s;or, <HI>Say on quickly;</HI> for it was very cold Weather. Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> told them, <HI>This was the Word of the Lord God unto them, that they lived in Words; but God Al|mighty looked for Fruits among them.</HI> As &s;oon as the&s;e Words were out of his Mouth, he was hurried out, and thrown down the Steps. But he got up again without Hurt, and went to his Lodging. Yet &s;everal of the People were &s;o reach'd that they became convinced of the Truth.</P>
<P>He having now done his Service in <HI>York,</HI> went from thence, and came the next Day to <HI>Burraby,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Burraby.</NOTE> and coming into a certain Meeting, where there was a Prie&s;t al&s;o, he had Occa&s;ion to declare the Truth, and many were convinced; and the Prie&s;t him&s;elf confe&s;&s;ed to the Truth, tho' he came not to live up to it.

&s;he was &s;o reach'd, that the being convinced of the Truth he declared, came to be one of his Friends. Oftentimes he had Opportunity to &s;peak with the Prie&s;ts, who, when they heard of his coming, would hide them|&s;elves; for it was a dreadful Thing to them, when it was told them, <HI>The Man in Leather Breeches is come;</HI> for this was indeed his D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s in tho&s;e Days, not on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of any Supe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion, but becau&s;e Leather Clothes being &s;trong, it was not un&s;uitable for one that travelled &s;o much as he did.</P>
<P>He now coming to <HI>Malton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Malton.</NOTE> had great Meetings; but it was thought &s;uch a &s;trange Thing to preach in Hou&s;es, that many du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t not come there, for Fear of their Relations; and therefore he was much de&s;ired to come and preach in the Churches, as the Steeple-hou&s;es are commonly called:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prie&s;t</HI> Boyes.</NOTE> Nay, one of the Prie&s;ts him&s;elf, called <HI>Boyes,</HI> (who was &s;o taken with him, that he called him Brother) did invite him to preach in his Steeple-hou&s;e: But <HI>G.

He al&s;o directed the People to their inward Teacher, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who would turn them from Darkne&s;s to Light: And ha|ving opened divers Scriptures to them, he directed them to the Spirit of God in them&s;elves, by which they might come to God, and al&s;o come to know who the fal&s;e Prophets were.

&s;uch Effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1652</NOTE> that many then declared they were convinced of the Truth.</P>
<P>From this Place he went to another Town, and Prie&s;t <HI>Boyes</HI> went a|long with him.

<P>Coming then towards Night into <HI>Patrington,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Patrington.</NOTE> he walked thro' the Town, and meeting the Prie&s;t in the Street, he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed both him and the People to <HI>repent, and turn to Lord:</HI> And People gathering about him, he declared to them the Word of Life, directing them to the inward Word, <HI>viz.</HI> the Light wherewith they were enlighten'd. And going afterwards to an Inn, for it was dark, he de&s;ired Lodging; but it was denied him: Then he asked for a little Meat, or Milk, offering to pay for it; But this al&s;o was refu&s;ed him. Being thus put off; he

walked out of the Town, and &s;ome rude Fellows follo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, asked him, <HI>What News?</HI> To which his An&s;wer was, <HI>Repent and fear the Lord.</HI> After he was gone a pretty Way out of the Town, he ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to another Hou&s;e, where he de&s;ired to have &s;ome Meat, Drink, and Lodging for his Mo|ney; but they would not &s;uffer him to &s;tay there: Then he went to another Hou&s;e, but met with the like Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;al. By this Time it was grown &s;o dark, that he could not &s;ee the High-way, but perceiving a Ditch, he got a little Water, and &s;o refre&s;hed him&s;elf. Then he got over the Ditch, and being weary, he &s;at down among&s;t the Furz-bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es, till it grew Day; and tnen he got up, and pa&s;&s;ing on thro' the Fields, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Man came after him with a Pike-&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f, and went along with him to a Town, where he rai&s;ed the People, with the Con&s;table and chief Con|&s;table, before the Sun was up. <HI>G.

But they laying hold on him, carried him back to <HI>Patrington,</HI> and guarded him with Halberds, Pikes, Staves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Being come to the &s;aid Town, all was in an Uproar; and the Prie&s;t and Con&s;table con&s;ulting together what to do with him, he too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that Opportunity to exhort the People to Repentance, and to preach the Word of Life to them. At la&s;t a di&s;creet Man called him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto his Hou&s;e, where he got &s;ome Milk and Bread, not having eaten for &s;ome Days before.

Fox,</HI> who was unwilling to let any Opportunity &s;lip, without admoni&s;hing People to Vertue, warned the Ju&s;tice to <HI>repent,</HI> and bid him <Q>Come to the Light which Chri&s;t had enlightned him with, that by it he might &s;ee all his evil Words and Actions, and &s;o return to Chri&s;t Je&s;us whil&s;t he had Time, and that he ought to prize that Time.</Q> <HI>Ay, Ay,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>the Light that is &s;poken of in the Third of</HI> John. <HI>G. Fox</HI> de&s;ired him that he would mind it, and obey it; and laying his Hand upon, him, he was &s;o brought down by the Lord's Power, that all the Watchmen &s;tood amazed. Then he took <HI>G. Fox</HI> with him into a Parlour with the other Men, and de&s;ired to &s;ee what he had in his Pockets, of Letters, or Intelligence; for it &s;eems they &s;u&s;pected him to be an Enemy to the Common-wealth. Then he pulled out his Linnen, and &s;hewed that he had no Letters; which made the Ju&s;tice &s;ay, <HI>He is not a Vagrant, by his Linnen;</HI> and &s;et him at Liberty. Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> went back, to <HI>Patrington</HI> again, with that Man who had rid before to the Ju&s;tice, and who lived in that Town. Coming to his Hou&s;e, he de&s;ired <HI>G. Fox</HI> to go to Bed, or to <HI>lye doan upon it:</HI> Which he did, that they might &s;ay, they had &s;een him in a Bed, or upon a Bed; for there was a Report, that he would not lie on any Bed, rai&s;ed doubtle&s;s, be|cau&s;e about that Time he had lain often without Doors</P>
<P>When the Fir&s;t Day of the Week was come, he went to the Steeple-hou&s;e, and declared the Doctrine of Truth to the Prie&s;t and People, without being mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ted. Then pre&s;ently after he had a great Meeting at that Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Hou&s;e where he lay, and many were convinced that Day of the Truth he preached; and they were exceeding &s;orry that they
<PB N="49" REF="003104_0060_0FEFF384B6E9EC20">
had not given him Lodging when he was there before. From thence he travelled thro' the Country, warning People, both in Towns, and in Country-Villages, to <HI>repent,</HI> and turn to Chri&s;t Je&s;us their Teacher.</P>
<P>On a Fir&s;t Day of the Week he came to one Colonel <HI>Overton</HI>'s Hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> Overton.</NOTE> and had a great Meeting of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ef of the People of that Country; where he opened many Things out of the Scriptures, which they never heard before&punc; Coming afterwards again to <HI>Patrington,</HI> he under&s;tood that a Taylor, and &s;ome wild Blades in that Town, had occa&s;ioned his being carried before the Ju&s;tice: This Taylor came to ask him For|givene&s;s, fearing he would complain of him: The Con&s;tables al&s;o were afraid, le&s;t he &s;hould trouble them: But he forgave them all, and ex|horted them to turn to the Lord, and to amend their Lives. Now that which made them the more afraid, was, that he having been not long before in the Steeple-hou&s;e at <HI>Oram,</HI> there came a Profe&s;&s;or that gave him a Pu&s;h on the Brea&s;t, and bid him, <HI>Get out of the Church.</HI> To which <HI>G. Fox</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Do&s;t thou call the Steeple-hou&s;e the Church? The Church is the People, whom God hath purcha&s;ed with his Blood, and not the Hou&s;e.</HI> But Ju&s;tice <HI>Hotham</HI> having heard of this Man's thus abu&s;ing <HI>G. Fox,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ju&s;t.</HI> Ho|tham.</NOTE> &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t a Warrant, and bound the &s;aid Man over to the Se&s;&s;ions. So zealous was this Ju&s;tice to keep the Peace, that he had asked <HI>G. Fox</HI> before, whether any People had abu&s;ed him: But he e&s;teeming it his Duty to forgive all, told him nothing of that Kind.</P>
<P>From <HI>Patrington</HI> he went to &s;everal great Mens Hou&s;es, warning them to repent. Some received him lovingly, and &s;ome &s;lighted him. Pa&s;&s;ing thus thro' the Country, at Night he came to another Town, where he de&s;ired Lodging and Meat, offering to pay for it; but they would not lodge him, unle&s;s he went to a Con&s;table to ask Leave, which they &s;aid was the Cu&s;tom of Strangers. But he told them, <HI>That Cu&s;tom was for &s;u&s;pected Per&s;ons, and not for &s;uch as he, who was an innocent Man.</HI> So after he had warned them to repent, and to mind the Day of their Vi&s;itation, and directed them to me Light of Chri&s;t, and Spirit of God, he pa&s;&s;ed away. As it grew dark, he &s;pied an Hay-&s;tack, and went and &s;at under it till Morning. The next Day he came to <HI>Hull,</HI> where he admoni&s;hed the People to turn to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that they might re|ceive Salvation. And being very weary with travelling on Foot &s;o far, he got that Night a Lodging there.</P>
<P>From thence he went to <HI>Nottingham&s;hire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nottingham|&s;hire. Lincoln&s;hire. Gainsbo|rough.</NOTE> vi&s;iting his Friends there; and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> where he did the like. And coming to <HI>Gainsborough,</HI> where one of his Friends had been preaching in the Mar|ket, he found the Town and People all in an Uproar; the more, be|cau&s;e a certain Man had rai&s;ed a fal&s;e Accu&s;ation, reporting, that <HI>G. Fox</HI> had &s;aid, <HI>He was Chri&s;t.</HI> Here going into the Hou&s;e of a friendly Man, the People ru&s;hed in after him, &s;o that the Hou&s;e &s;oon was f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l|led; and among&s;t the re&s;t was al&s;o this fal&s;e Accu&s;er, who &s;aid openly before all the People, <HI>That</HI> G. Fox <HI>&s;aid he was Chri&s;t; and that he had got Witne&s;&s;es to prove the &s;ame. G. Fox</HI> kindled with Zeal, &s;tept upon the Table, and &s;aid to the People, <HI>That Chri&s;t was in them, except they were Reprobates; and that it was Chri&s;t the eternal Power of God, that &s;poke in him at that Time unto them; not that he was Chri&s;t.</HI> This gave general Sa|tisfaction, except to the fal&s;e Accu&s;er him&s;elf, to whom <HI>G. Fox</HI> &s;aid, <HI>That he was a</HI> Judas, <HI>and that</HI> Judas<HI>'s End &s;hould be his; and that</HI> That <HI>was the Word of the Lord thro' him</HI> [Fox] <HI>to him.</HI> The Minds of the People com|ing thus to be quieted, they departed peaceably. But very remarkable it was, <HI>This</HI> Judas <HI>&s;hortly after hanged him&s;elf, and a Stake was driven into his Grave.</HI> Now tho' this was a well known Thing in this Country, yet &s;ome Prie&s;ts &s;pread a Report, <HI>That a</HI> Quaker <HI>had hanged him&s;elf in</HI> Lin|coln&s;hire,
<PB N="50" REF="003104_0061_0FEFF386E980CD38">
<HI>and had a Stake driven thro' him.</HI> And tho' this was taken up|on Tru&s;t by Hear&s;ay, yet, out of meer Malice, a certain Prie&s;t gave out this Fal&s;hood in Print, as a true Matter. But this wicked Slander prevailed &s;o little, that many People in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> were convinced of the Truth preached by <HI>G. Fox.</HI></P>
<P>After this he pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>York&s;hire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">York&s;hire. Warn&s;worth.</NOTE> and coming to <HI>Warn&s;worth,</HI> went to the Steeple-hou&s;e in the Forenoon, but found no Acceptance; and being th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> out, he was &s;orely beaten with Staves, and Clods and Stones were thrown at him; yet he exhorted to repent and turn to Chri&s;t. In the Afternoon he went to another Steeple-hou&s;e; but the Sermon was fini&s;hed before he got thither; &s;o he preached Repentance to the Peo|ple that were not departed, and directed them to their inward Teacher, Chri&s;t Je&s;us.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Donca&s;ter.</NOTE> From hence he came to <HI>Donca&s;ter,</HI> where he had formerly preached in the Market; but now on the Fir&s;t Day of the Week he went into the Steeple-hou&s;e; and after the Prie&s;t had done, he began to &s;peak, but was hurried out, and haled before the Magi&s;trates, who threatned him with Death, if ever he came thither again. But not|with&s;tanding all this, <HI>G. Fox</HI> bid them <HI>Mind the Light of Chri&s;t in them,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>That God was come to teach his People him&s;elf, whether they would hear or not.</HI> After a while being put out with &s;ome of his Friends, that were with him, they were &s;toned by the rude Multitude. A certain Innkeeper, that was a Bailiff, &s;eeing this, came and took them into his Hou&s;e, but one of the Stones, that were thrown, hit his Head, &s;o that the Blood ran down his Face. The next Fir&s;t Day <HI>G. Fox</HI> went to <HI>Tichhil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tichhil.</NOTE> where he went into the Steeple-hou&s;e, and there found the Prie&s;t, and the Chief of the Pari&s;h in the Chancel, to whom he began to &s;peak; but they immediately fell upon him, and the Clark &s;truck him with his Bible &s;o violently on the Face, that the Blood gu&s;hed out, and he bled exceedingly. Then the People thru&s;t him out of the Steeple-Hou&s;e, and beating him, threw him down, and dragged him along the Street, &s;o that he became be&s;meared with Blood and Dirt, and his Hat was taken away. When he was got up again, he &s;poke to the People, and &s;hewed them how they di&s;honoured Chri&s;tianity. Some Time after the Prie&s;t coming by, &s;co&s;&s;ingly called <HI>G. Fox</HI> and his Friends, <HI>Quakers.</HI> But he was &s;poken to, in &s;uch an Authority and Dread, that he fell a trembling; which made one of the People &s;ay, <HI>Look how the Prie&s;t trem|bles and &s;hakes, he is turned a</HI> Quaker <HI>al&s;o.</HI> Some moderate Ju&s;tices now, hearing how <HI>G. Fox</HI> and his Friends had been abu&s;ed, came to examine the Bu&s;ine&s;s; and the <HI>Clark</HI> was afraid of having his Hand cut off, for &s;triking him in the Church: But <HI>G. Fox,</HI> as a true Chri&s;tian, forgave him, and would not appear again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Thus far <HI>G. Fox</HI> only hath been mentioned as a Preacher of Repen|tance; but now &s;ome others of his Per&s;wa&s;ion began al&s;o to preach publickly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Aldam. R. Farn&s;|worth. W. Dewsbu|ry. Warn&s;worth.</NOTE> <HI>viz. Thomas Aldam, Richard Farn&s;worth,</HI> and, not long after, <HI>William Dewsbury.</HI> This made &s;uch a Stir, that the Prie&s;t of <HI>Warn&s;worth</HI> produced a Warrant from the Ju&s;tices again&s;t <HI>G. Fox</HI> and <HI>Thomas Al|dam.</HI> The Con&s;table, who came with this Order which was to be ex|ecuted in any Part of the We&s;t-Riding of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> took <HI>Tho. Aldam,</HI> and carried him to <HI>York,</HI> and <HI>G. Fox</HI> went with him twenty Miles; but tho' the Con&s;table had a Warrant for him al&s;o, yet he meddled not with <HI>G. Fox,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>He was loth to trouble Men that were Strangers; but Tho. Aldam was his Neighbour.</HI> About this Time <HI>Richard Farn&s;worth</HI> went into an eminent Steeple-hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wakefield</NOTE> in, or about <HI>Wakefield;</HI> where he &s;poke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o powerfully, that the People were amazed. The Prie&s;t of that Place who&s;e Name was <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> &s;pread a &s;landerous Report, <HI>That</HI> G. Fox <HI>carried Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">les about with him, and made People drink thereof, which
<PB N="51" REF="003104_0062_0FEFF38B0F8F0C28">
made them follow him.</HI> And <HI>that he rid upon a great black Hor&s;e, and was &s;een in one Country upon that Hor&s;e, and in the &s;ame Hour in an other Country three&s;core Miles off.</HI> But the&s;e horrid Lies were &s;o far from turn|ing to the Prie&s;t's Advantage, that he preached many of his Hearers away from him; for it was well known, that <HI>G. Fox</HI> had no Hor&s;e at that Time, but travelled on Foot. He coming now into a Steeple-hou&s;e not far from <HI>Bradford,</HI> the Prie&s;t took his Text from <HI>Jer.</HI> V. 31. <HI>My People love to have it &s;o;</HI> leaving out the foregoing Words, <HI>The Prophets prophe&s;y fal&s;ely, and the Prie&s;ts bear Rule by their Means. G. Fox</HI> unwilling to let this pa&s;s unregarded, &s;hewed the People the Prie&s;t's unfair Deal|ing, and directing them to Chri&s;t, the true inward Teacher, declared, That <HI>God was come to teach his People him&s;elf, and to bring them off from all the World's Teachers and Hirelings, that they might come to receive freely from him;</HI> concluding his Speech with a Warning of the Day of the Lord that was coming upon all Fle&s;h. He pa&s;&s;ed from thence without much Oppo&s;ition, and travelled now for &s;ome Time with <HI>Richard Farn&s;worth,</HI> with whom he once pa&s;&s;ed a Night in the open Field, on a Bed they made of Fern.</P>
<P>Then parting from him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wentzer|dale.</NOTE> he came to <HI>Wentzerdale,</HI> where he went into the Steeple-hou&s;e; and after the Lecture, he &s;poke to the People much in the &s;ame Terms as he u&s;ed to do on the like Occa&s;ions; and had not much Oppo&s;ition there. Thus he went from Place to Place, and often met with &s;trange Occurrences, &s;ome of which were more joco&s;e than &s;erious; others very rude, and even dangerous to his Life. But he tru&s;ted in God, really believing that he had &s;ent him to preach Re|pentance, and to exhort People to a true Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus travelling on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sedburgh. <HI>Ju&s;t.</HI> Ben&s;on.</NOTE> he came near <HI>Sedburgh;</HI> there he went to a Meet|ing at Ju&s;tice <HI>Ben&s;on</HI>'s, where a People met that were &s;eparated from the publick Wor&s;hip; and by his Preaching, he gave &s;uch general Satisfac|tion, that mo&s;t of the Hearers were convinc'd of the Truth declared by him. Thus the Number of his Fellow-Believers increa&s;ed &s;o, that now they had Meetings by them&s;elves, in many Places of the Country. About this Time there being a Fair at <HI>Sedburgh, G. Fox</HI> declared the Day of the Lord thro the Fair; and afterwards went into the Steeple-hou&s;e-Yard, where Abundance of People came to him: Here he preached for &s;everal Hours, &s;hewing, <Q>That the Lord was come to teach his People him&s;elf, and to bring them off from all the World's Ways, and Teachers, to Chri&s;t, the true Teacher, and the true Way to God. Moreover, he &s;hewed the declining State of the modern Doctors and Teachers; and exhorted the People to come off from the Temples made with Hands, and wait to receive the Spirit of the Lord, that they might know them&s;elves to be the Temples of God.</Q> None of the Prie&s;ts, &s;everal of whom were there, &s;poke again&s;t what he had declared; but a Cap|tain &s;aid, <HI>Why will you not go into the Church; for this is not a fit Place to preach in? G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>That he did not approve of their Church.</HI> Then &s;tood up one <HI>Francis Howgil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">F.

Fox</HI> opened to the People, <Q>That that Ground and Hou&s;e was not more holy than another Place; and that the Hou&s;e was not the Church, but the People, whom Chri&s;t was the Head of.</Q> Then the Prie&s;ts coming to him, he warned them to repent; upon which one of them &s;aid, <HI>He was mad:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Capt.</HI> Ward.

<PB N="52" REF="003104_0063_0FEFF38D00462120">
Howgil,</HI> and one <HI>John Audland</HI> had been preaching in the Morning. The Chappel at that Time was &s;o full of People, that many could not get in:<NOTE PLACE="marg">J. Audland.</NOTE> And <HI>Howgil</HI> &s;aid afterwards, <HI>He thought</HI> G. Fox <HI>look'd into the Chappel, and his Spirit was ready to fail.</HI> But <HI>G. Fox</HI> did not look into it; however, <HI>Howgil</HI> had been &s;o reach'd when he heard him preach in the Steeple-hou&s;e-Yard at <HI>Sedburgh,</HI> that he was, as it were, check'd, and &s;o quickly made an End of his Sermon; thinking as well as others, that <HI>G. Fox</HI> would preach there that Day, as indeed he did: For having re|fre&s;hed him&s;elf at Noon with a little Water out of a Brook, he went and &s;ate down on the Top of a Rock hard by the Chappel, intending to have a Meeting there. At this People wondered, becau&s;e they look'd upon the Church (&s;o called) as an holy Place, requi&s;ite for Wor&s;hip. But <HI>G. Fox</HI> told them afterwards, <HI>That the Ground whereon he &s;tood, was as good as that of the Steeple-hou&s;e;</HI> be&s;ides, we find, that Chri&s;t him&s;elf did preach on a Mountain, and al&s;o at the Sea-Side. Now in the Afternoon the People gathered about him, with &s;everal of their Preach|ers, and among&s;t the&s;e, <HI>F. Howgil,</HI> and <HI>J. Audland.</HI> To this Auditory, which was judged to con&s;i&s;t of more than a thou&s;and People, <HI>G. Fox</HI> began to preach, and &s;poke about the Space of three Hours, directing all <Q>To the Spirit of God in them&s;elves, that &s;o they might be turned from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan, which they had been under, unto God; by which they &s;hould become Children of the Light, and, by the Spirit of Truth, be led into all Truth, and &s;o &s;en&s;ibly under&s;tand the Words of the Prophets, of Chri&s;t, and of the Apo&s;tles; and come to know Chri&s;t to be their Teacher to in&s;truct them; their Coun&s;ellor to direct them, their Shepherd to feed them, their Bi&s;hop to over&s;ee them, and their Prophet to open divine My&s;teries to them; that &s;o their Bodies might be pre|pared, &s;anctify'd, and made fit Temples for God and Chri&s;t to dwell in. Moreover, he explained the Prophets, and the Figures, and Shadows, and directed his Hearers to Chri&s;t the Sub&s;tance. He al|&s;o opened the Parables and Sayings of Chri&s;t, and &s;hewed the Intent and Scope of the Apo&s;tles Writings, and Epi&s;tles to the Elect. Then he &s;poke al&s;o concerning the State of the Apo&s;tacy, that hath been &s;ince the Apo&s;tles Days; how the Prie&s;ts had gotten the Scripture, without being in that Spirit which gave them forth; and how they were found in the Steps of the fal&s;e Prophets, Scribes, and Phari&s;ees of old, and were &s;uch as the true Prophets, Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles cried again&s;t; in&s;omuch, that none that were guided by the Spirit of God now, could own them.</Q> Whil&s;t <HI>G. Fox</HI> was thus preaching, many old People went into the Chappel, and looked out at the Windows, thinking it a &s;trange Thing to &s;ee a Man preach on a Hill, and not in the Church (as they called it.) He perceiving this, &s;aid, <Q>That the Steeple-hou&s;e, and the Ground whereon it &s;tood, was no more holy than that Hill; and that tho&s;e Temples, which they called the dreadful Hou&s;es of God, were not &s;et up by the Command of God and Chri&s;t: nor their Prie&s;ts in&s;tituted, as <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Prie&s;thood was; nor their Tythes appointed by God, as tho&s;e among&s;t the <HI>Jews</HI> were. But that Chri&s;t was come, who ended both the Temple, and its Wor&s;hip, and the Prie&s;ts and their Tythes; and that therefore all ought to hearken unto him; for he &s;aid, <HI>Learn of me;</HI> and God &s;aid of him, <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed; hear ye him.</HI> In Conclu&s;ion, he &s;aid, That the Lord God had &s;ent him to preach the Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, and Word of Life among&s;t them; and to bring them off from all the&s;e Temples, Tythes, Prie&s;ts, and Rudi|ments of the World, which were gotten up &s;ince the Apo&s;tles Days,

and had been &s;et up by &s;uch as had erred from the Spirit and Power the Apo&s;tles were in.</Q><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

<P>After this Meeting was over, <HI>G. Fox</HI> went to <HI>John Audland</HI>'s, who, as well as <HI>Francis Howgil,</HI> and others, had been quite brought over by his effectual Preaching. And as the&s;e had been zealous Preachers among&s;t tho&s;e of their former Per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;o it was not long before they became Publi&s;hers of that Doctrine, which now, by the Mini&s;try of <HI>G.

<P><HI>John Audland</HI> was a young Man, of a comely Countenance, and very lovely Qualities.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Colton</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;hire.</HI> Character of <HI>J. Audland.</HI></NOTE> When he was but &s;eventeen or eighteen Years old, he was very religious, and a zealous Searcher of the Holy Scriptures and having a good Under&s;tanding, and &s;trong Memory, he thereby gathered a large Trea&s;ure of Scripture-Learning, became an eminent Teacher a|mong&s;t the <HI>Independents,</HI> and had a very numerous Auditory. But when he heard <HI>G. Fox</HI> preach, he was thereby &s;o reached to the Heart, that he began in Proce&s;s of Time to &s;ee the Emptine&s;s of his great Literal Knowledge, and that all his Righteou&s;ne&s;s was but as filthy Raggs. This brought him to a State of Mourning; for now he &s;aw that all his Profe&s;&s;ion and Wi&s;dom could not bring him to true Happine&s;s. But the Lord, who doth <HI>not break the brui&s;ed Reed, nor quench the &s;moaking Flax,</HI> did pity him in this State of deep Humiliation, and bore him up again by his &s;upporting Power; whereby in Time he came to be pre|pared to that Service he was appointed to by God.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Francis Howgil;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And of <HI>F. Howgil.</HI></NOTE> he was al&s;o a religious Man, who having &s;een the Super&s;titions of the Epi&s;copal Church, had left it, and applied him&s;elf to the <HI>Independents.</HI> But altho' he, who had been trained up in the Univer&s;ity to be a Mini&s;ter, became a Teacher among&s;t the <HI>Inde|pendents,</HI> and was zealous in Vertue; yet he remained di&s;&s;atisfy'd in him|&s;elf, finding, that notwith&s;tanding all his Fa&s;ting, Praying, and good Works, the Root of Sin &s;till remained in him: And altho' the common Doctrine was, that Chri&s;t had taken the Guilt of Sin upon him&s;elf, yet this could not &s;atisfy him; becau&s;e his Con&s;cience told him, <HI>His Servant thou art, whom thou obeye&s;t.</HI> Thus encrea&s;ing in Under&s;tanding, it was re|vealed to him, that the Lord, according to what the Prophets had fore|told, would teach his People him&s;elf; and it &s;eemed al&s;o to him, that this Time was near at Hand. Some while after it happened, as hath been &s;aid already, that he was pre&s;ent when <HI>G. Fox</HI> preach'd, and when he heard him &s;ay, That <HI>the Light of Chri&s;t in Man was the Way to Chri&s;t,</HI> he believed this to be the Word of Truth; and he &s;aw how he had been ignorant of the Principle of true Religion. Submitting then to the Reproofs of this inward Light, he &s;aw the Unfruitfulne&s;s of all his La|bour; and Angui&s;h and Sorrow &s;eized on him; and Judgment went over all his former Actions: But he being given up, and re&s;ign'd in that State, &s;aying with him&s;elf, <HI>Thou, O God, art ju&s;t in all thy Judgments,</HI> it plea&s;ed the Lord in due Time to fill his Heart with Joy, and to make him a Mini&s;ter of his Everla&s;ting Word. But no &s;ooner did he enter into that Service, but both Prie&s;ts and Magi&s;trates, of whom he for|merly had been beloved, became his Enemies; and Envy was &s;o kind|led

again&s;t him, that he was lock'd up in a na&s;ty Place, at <HI>Appleby</HI> in <HI>We&s;tmorland,</HI> and was kept there Pri&s;oner for &s;ome Time.</P>
<P>But let me now return to <HI>G. Fox,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Appleby <HI>in</HI> We&s;tmorland Kendal.</NOTE> who coming to <HI>Kendal,</HI> had a Meet|ing there in the Town-Hall, where declaring the Word of Life, he &s;hewed the People, <Q>How they might come to the &s;aving Knowledge of Chri&s;t, and to have a right Under&s;tanding of the Holy Scripture; opening to them what it was that would lead them into the Way of Reconciliation with God.</Q> This was of &s;uch Effect, that &s;eve|ral became convinced of the Truth publi&s;hed by him; and others were &s;o well affected to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Under-Bar|row.</NOTE> that when he went to <HI>&V;nder-Barrow,</HI> &s;everal Peo|ple accompanied him, and he had great Rea&s;onings with them, but e&s;pecially with one <HI>Edward Burrough,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">E. Burrough.</NOTE> who, tho' of extraordinary Parts, and acquired Knowledge, was not able to with&s;tand the efficacious Say|ings of <HI>G. Fox.</HI> And becau&s;e this <HI>Burrough</HI> became an eminent Man among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, being endued with Courage and Under|&s;tanding, fit to overcome his Oppo&s;ers, and to break even &s;tony Hearts, I'll mention here a little of his De&s;cent and Quality.</P>
<P>He was born in the Barony of <HI>Kendal</HI> in <HI>We&s;tmorland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Chara|cter.</NOTE> of Parents, who for their hone&s;t and vertuous Life, were in good Repute; he was well educated, and train'd up in &s;uch Learning as that Country did afford. His Knowledge and Under&s;tanding &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed his Years; for being but a Boy, he had the Spirit of a Man, and in his Youth was endued with Wi&s;dom above his Equals in Years: Moreover, he was very religious, conver&s;ing frequently with tho&s;e that were in E&s;teem for their Piety and godly Life. Neither was he inclined to the ordinary Plea&s;ures of Youth; but it was his Delight to be exerci&s;ed in reading of the Holy Scripture, wherein he was well ver&s;ed. By his Parents he was trained up in the Epi&s;copal Wor&s;hip; yet when but twelve Years of Age, he often went to the Meeting of the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> becau&s;e their Doctrine in many Things &s;eemed to him to approach nearer to Truth, than that of the publick Church; wherefore he became a Follower of the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> altho' he was reviled for it by his Acquaintance. But being come to the Age of about &s;eventeen Years, and growing more and more &s;en&s;ible of his own Condition, he was often &s;truck with Terror, and when he had been praying, he heard, as it were, a Voice, <HI>Thou art ignorant of God; thou knowe&s;t not where he is, nor what he is: To what Purpo&s;e is thy Prayer?</HI> This brought him under &s;uch a Concern, that he began to take diligent Heed to his Life, &s;o that he ab&s;tained not on|ly from all Vanities, but when Occa&s;ion offer'd, he reproved others for their vain Conver&s;ation and Wickedne&s;s; but becau&s;e of this, he was derided, and looked upon &s;cornfully by many; yet continued to live religiou&s;ly, and felt &s;ometimes &s;weet Refre&s;hments to his Soul. But tho' he had the Truth in his Comprehen&s;ion, yet he wanted the real and experimental Knowledge of it, and &s;o became darkned again, lo|&s;ing what he once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: And being too ready to flatter him&s;elf, would &s;ay, <HI>Whom God loves once, he loves for ever.</HI> Now he grew weary of hearing any of the Prie&s;ts, for he &s;aw they did not po&s;&s;e&s;s what they &s;poke of to others; and &s;ometimes he began to que&s;tion his own Experiences. Being thus many Times put to a Stand, he &s;eem'd al|mo&s;t to be at a Lo&s;s. In this Condition he heard <HI>G. Fox</HI> preach, and afterwards rea&s;oned with him; and it plea&s;ed the Lord &s;o to open his Under&s;tanding, that he perceived (as he relates him&s;elf) that he was in the prodigal State, above the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and not in the pure Fear of the Lord. Being thus convinced, he entred into the Society of the de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>Quakers,</HI> tho' he was now rejected by his Relations, and by a blind Zeal, turn'd out of his Father's Hou&s;e. This he bore
<PB N="55" REF="003104_0066_0FEFF394147E79A8">
patiently, and continued faithful in the Doctrine he had embraced. And in Proce&s;s of Time he &s;o advanced in true Knowledge, that he became a very eminent Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel. But what Adver&s;ities did he not undergo! Reviling, Slandering, Buffeting, and Caning was often his Lot; Watching and Fa&s;ting were many Times his Portion; and Im|pri&s;onment, great Jeopardies, and Danger of Life, he was not unac|quainted with. But nothing could make this Hero &s;hrink: He always was laborious, and &s;eldom had any Hours of Re&s;t. In his Preaching he was very acceptable, and eloquent in his Speech, and had the Tongue (according to what an eminent Author relates, that knew him from his Youth) of a learned Orator, to declare him&s;elf to the Under&s;tandings and Con&s;ciences of all Men he met with. He was al&s;o a great Writer, and often would engage in Di&s;putes with tho&s;e of other Per&s;wa&s;ions, &s;paring no Pains where he thought he could &s;erve the Lord, and the Church. Thus much for this Time of <HI>E. Burrough.</HI></P>
<P>Let's return now to <HI>G. Fox,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Under-Bar|row.</NOTE> whom we left at <HI>&V;nder-Barrow,</HI> where, with the Con&s;ent of the Inhabitants, he had a great Meeting in the Chappel, and many were convinced, and received the Truth preached by him. From thence he went to <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and having in &s;ome Places &s;poken in the Steeple-hou&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ulver&s;tone. Swarthmore. <HI>Judge</HI> Fell.</NOTE> he came to <HI>&V;lver&s;tone,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Swarth|more,</HI> to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Thomas Fell,</HI> a Judge in <HI>Wales,</HI> where many Prie&s;ts frequently came. The Judge was at that Time abroad, employ'd in the Exerci&s;e of his Office; and his Wife <HI>Margaret</HI> was al&s;o gone abroad that Day. <HI>G. Fox</HI> in the mean while coming thither, met the Prie&s;t <HI>William Lampitt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Lampitt.</NOTE> who was a high Notioni&s;t, and rich in Words. But <HI>G. Fox</HI> &s;oon perceiving that he was without the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what he profe&s;&s;ed, oppo&s;ed him boldly. Before it was Night <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> re|turned home, and her Children told her, That <HI>Lampitt</HI> and <HI>Fox</HI> had di&s;|agreed, which did &s;omewhat trouble her, for the making much of the Prie&s;ts, e&s;pecially admired <HI>Lampitt.</HI> That &s;ame Night <HI>G. Fox</HI> had much Rea&s;oning there, and declared the Truth to her and her Family. The next Day <HI>Lampitt</HI> came again, and <HI>G. Fox</HI> di&s;cour&s;ed with him in the Pre|&s;ence of <HI>Margaret Fell,</HI> who then began clearly to di&s;cern the Prie&s;t. The following Day being appointed for an Humiliation, <HI>Margaret</HI> went with her Children to the Steeple-hou&s;e at <HI>&V;lver&s;tone,</HI> having asked <HI>G. Fox</HI> before to go with her: But he replying, That <HI>he mu&s;t do as he was ordered by the Lord,</HI> left her, and walked into the Fields; and there he felt a &s;trong Motion to go al&s;o to the Steeple-hou&s;e. When he came there the People were &s;inging, but what they &s;ung was, according to his Opini|on, altogether un&s;uitable to their States. After they had done, he &s;tept up on a Form, and asked Leave to &s;peak: The Prie&s;t con&s;enting, <HI>G. Fox</HI> began thus: <HI>He is not a</HI> Jew <HI>that is one outwardly; neither is that Circumci&s;i|on which is outward: But he is a</HI> Jew <HI>that is one inwardly; and that is Circum|ci&s;ion which is of the Heart.</HI> And &s;o he went on, and &s;aid, <Q>That Chri&s;t was the Light of the World, and enlighteneth every Man that com|eth into the World, and that by this Light they might be gathered to God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> &s;tanding up in her P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, wondered at this Doctrine, having never heard any &s;uch before. In the mean while <HI>G. Fox</HI> went on, and opening the Scriptures &s;aid, <Q>That they were the Prophet's Words, and Chri&s;t's, and the Apo&s;tle's Words; and that what they &s;poke, they enjoyed and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and had it from the Lord.</Q> <HI>What have any to do,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>with the Scriptures, if they come not to the Spirit that gave them forth? You will &s;ay,</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>&s;aith this, and the Apo&s;tles &s;ay this; but what can&s;t thou, O Man, &s;ay thy &s;elf concerning this? Art thou a Child of the Light? Do&s;t thou walk in the Light? And what thou &s;peake&s;t, is it inwardly from God?</HI> He &s;hewed al&s;o, <Q>That God was come
<PB N="56" REF="003104_0067_0FEFF39795674750">
to teach his People him&s;elf, by his Spirit, and to bring them off from their Churches, and Religions, and their Ways of Wor&s;hip, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> The&s;e his Words did &s;o effectually reach the afore&s;aid <HI>Margaret,</HI> that &s;he &s;ate down in her Pew again, and weeping bitterly, cried in her Spirit to the Lord, <HI>We are all Thieves! We are all Thieves! We have taken the Scriptures in Words, and know nothing of them in our &s;elves. G. Fox</HI> &s;till going on, declared again&s;t the fal&s;e Prophets, and &s;aid, <Q>That their Way of Wor&s;hip was but talking of other Mens Words, and that they them&s;elves were out of the Life and Spirit, which tho&s;e were in who gave them forth.</Q> Then cried out a Ju&s;tice of Peace, call'd <HI>John Sawrey, Take him away:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">J. Sawrey.</NOTE> But <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> &s;aid to the Officers: <HI>Let him alone: Why may not he &s;peak as well as any other?</HI> The Prie&s;t <HI>Lampitt,</HI> (it's like to plea&s;e her) &s;aid al&s;o, <HI>Let him &s;peak. G. Fox</HI> then &s;peaking yet a while, was at length led out by the Con&s;table, according to the Order of the &s;aid Ju&s;tice <HI>Sawrey;</HI> and then he &s;poke to the People in the Grave-Yard. In the Evening he came again into the Hou&s;e of Judge <HI>Fell,</HI> where he took Occa&s;ion to &s;peak to the Servants, and tho&s;e of the Family, who mo&s;t of them came &s;o effectually to be convinced by him, that they embraced the Truth which he preached. Among the&s;e was al&s;o <HI>William Caton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">W.

The Fir&s;t Day after he went to <HI>Aldenham</HI>-Steeple-hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aldenham.</NOTE> where, when the Prie&s;t had done, he &s;poke to the People, and admoni&s;hed them to return to the Lord. From thence he went to <HI>Ram-&s;ide,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ram-&s;ide.</NOTE> where was a Chappel, in which one <HI>Thomas Law&s;on,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">T.

Fox</HI> was to come there in the Afternoon; by which Means very many People were gathered together. When he came, he &s;aw there was no Place &s;o convenient to &s;peak to the People, as the Chap|pel, and therefore he went into it. The Prie&s;t <HI>Law&s;on</HI> willing to give a full Opportunity to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> went not up into the Pulpit, but left all the Time to him. And <HI>G. Fox</HI> &s;o powerfully declared the Doc|trine of Truth, that many receiv'd it, and among tho&s;e the Prie&s;t him|&s;elf, who left off his preaching for Hire, and in Proce&s;s of Time came to preach the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his glorious Go&s;pel freely; which however did not hinder him to exerci&s;e him&s;elf in the Knowledge of Herbs, wherein he came to be &s;o experienc'd, that he was, as I have been told, one of the mo&s;t skilful Herbali&s;ts in <HI>England;</HI> which gave Occa&s;ion to an eminent Botani&s;t, who at fir&s;t &s;eem'd a little &s;hy of him, when he perceiv'd his great Skill, to love him as a &s;ingular Friend. But this tran&s;iently.</P>
<P>Now I return again to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> who having perform'd his Service about <HI>Ram-&s;ide,</HI> went &s;omewhere el&s;e, and came al&s;o to <HI>Becliff,</HI> where he found &s;ome People that told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beclif.</NOTE> <HI>They could not di&s;pute&punc;</HI> But he bid them <Q>to fear the Lord, and not to &s;peak the Words of God in an airy Manner, but do the Things required. Moreover, that they ought to mind the Light of Chri&s;t, and take heed to his Spirit in their Hearts, whereby they would come to &s;ee their evil Thoughts, Words, and Actions; for this Light (he &s;aid) would &s;hew them their Sins, and by following this Light, they &s;hould al&s;o &s;ee that their Saviour Chri&s;t Je&s;us &s;aved them from Sin: And, he &s;aid, the fir&s;t Step to Peace was to &s;tand &s;till in the Light, which &s;hewed them their Sins and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; by which they &s;hould &s;ee they were in the Fall of the old <HI>Adam,</HI> in Darkne&s;s and Death, alienated from

the Covenant of the Promi&s;e, and without God in the World; and that Chri&s;t who died for them, was their Saviour and Redeemer, and their Way to God.</Q> After <HI>G.

Hither came a great many People, unto whom he preached, and many were convinced. From thence he returned to <HI>Swarthmore</HI> again: For <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> being full of Fear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marg. Fell.</NOTE> and expecting her Husband's Return home, had de&s;ired <HI>G.

At that Time <HI>Richard Farn&s;worth</HI> and <HI>James Naylor</HI> were at her Hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R.

And tho' at fir&s;t he was di&s;plea&s;ed, yet after he had heard them &s;peak, he was better &s;atisfied. And they making as if they would go away, &s;he de&s;ired them to &s;tay, becau&s;e &s;he expected <HI>G.

Dinner in the mean Time being ready, Judge <HI>Fell,</HI> and his Wife <HI>Margaret,</HI> &s;at down at Table, and whil&s;t they were &s;itting, an extraordinary Power &s;eizing on her, made &s;uch an Operation on her Mind, that he was &s;truck with Amazement, and knew not what to think of it; but he was quiet and &s;till; and the Children al&s;o were become &s;o grave and mode&s;t, that they could not play on their Mu&s;ick they were learning. At Night <HI>G. Fox</HI> came, and Judge <HI>Fell</HI> &s;itting in the Parlour, <HI>Margaret</HI> asked him, <HI>If</HI> G. Fox <HI>might come in;</HI> and he &s;aid, <HI>Yes.

Now whil&s;t &s;ome were &s;peaking how &s;everal in tho&s;e Parts were convinced of the Truth now declared, and that they knew not where to get a Meeting-Place; Judge <HI>Fell</HI> hearing them, &s;aid of his own Accord, <HI>You may meet in my

Judge <HI>Fell</HI> not being willing to appear in that Meeting, went that Day to the Steeple-hou&s;e, and none with him but his Clerk and his Groom. Yet in Proce&s;s of Time he came to be &s;o well affected to the Doctrine of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, that tho' he did not enter publickly into their Society, yet he loved them, and &s;everal Years before his Death, he did not frequent the Steeple-hou&s;e any more.</P>
<P>After <HI>G.

And after having travelled about &s;ome Time, and preached in &s;ome Places, &s;ome|times with rude Oppo&s;ition, he returned to <HI>Swarthmore,</HI> where di&s;|cour&s;ing with &s;everal Prie&s;ts at Judge <HI>Fell</HI>'s Hou&s;e, he asked them, <HI>Whe|ther any of them ever heard the Voice of God or Chri&s;t, commanding them to go to any People, and declare the Word of the Lord to them?</HI> But none of them an&s;wered this with <HI>Yea:</HI> Yet one &s;aying, <HI>I can &s;peak of my Experience as much as you; G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>Experience was one Thing, but to go with a Me&s;&s;age, and to have the Word of the Lord, as the Prophets and Apo&s;tles had, was quite another.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">T.

<P>Now a great Rage aro&s;e among the Prie&s;ts, and they began as much as they could, to &s;tir up to Per&s;ecution; for not only <HI>T.

<P><HI>G.

For &s;uch Abu&s;es as <HI>G.

But neither the Bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, Buffeting, nor Stoning of the mad Rabble, nor the Jails or Whippings that befel them from the Magi|&s;trates, were able to &s;top the Progre&s;s of the Doctrine they preach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to the People in Marke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and Streets, and al&s;o in Steeple-hou&s;es: And many even of tho&s;e that had been en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ag'd like Wolves, became afterwards like Lambs, and &s;uffered patiently from others, what for|merly they them&s;elves in a blind Zeal had committed.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, by a firm and la&s;ting Patience, have &s;urmoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed the greate&s;t Difficulties, and are at length become a nume|rous People, many not valuing their own Lives, when they met with any Opportunity, for the Service of God.

Coming to <HI>Grayrigg,</HI> he had a Meeting there; where a Prie&s;t came to oppo&s;e, but was confounded; and there being many People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grayrigg.</NOTE> &s;ome of the Milk-Pails that &s;tood upon the Side of the Hou&s;e, tumbled down, by Rea&s;on of the Croud; from which the Prie&s;t afterwards rai&s;ed a Slander, <HI>That the Devil frighted him, and took away one Side of the Hou&s;e.</HI> And tho' this was a known Fal&s;hood, yet it was given out as true in publick Print.</P>
<P>Another Time this Prie&s;t came to another Meeting and fell to jang|ling, &s;aying fir&s;t, That <HI>the Scriptures were the Word of God.</HI> To which <HI>G.

Fox</HI> di|rected the People to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Prie&s;t taking out his Bible, &s;aid, <HI>It was the Word of God.</HI> Then <HI>G.

<P>The Year being now come to an End,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Tran&s;|actions.</NOTE> and a War kindled between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> the II. then in Exile, ask'd the <HI>Dutch</HI> to be receiv'd in their Navy, as a Volunteer, without any Command: But this was courteou&s;ly refu&s;ed by the States General. <HI>Oliver Crom|wel,</HI> in the mean while, &s;trove for the &s;upreme Authority in <HI>England,</HI> the more, becau&s;e he perceived how &s;ome of the Parliament, jealous of his increa&s;ing Greatne&s;s, endeavoured to cro&s;s him in his De&s;ign. This made him labour to get the Parliament di&s;&s;olved: But they not going on &s;o quickly as he would have them, to put a Period to their Sitting, he re&s;olved arbitrarily to make an End of them. And entering the Hou&s;e in the Month called <HI>April,</HI> 1653, after having rudely inveighed again&s;t them, by telling them, That they had made a bad U&s;e of their Authority, and that without their Di&s;&s;olution the Realm would not be &s;afe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oliver</HI> di&s;|&s;olves the Par|liament.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He at length cried out, <HI>You are no Parliament:</HI> And then order|ing &s;ome Musketeers to enter, he made the Members depart the Hou&s;e, and ordered the Doors to be &s;hut; putting thus an End to this A&s;&s;em|bly, that had been &s;itting nigh thirteen Years.</P>
<P>But what is remarkable, <HI>G.

This agreed with what <HI>G. Fox</HI> had predicted. And a Fortnight after, Ju&s;tice <HI>Ben&s;on</HI> told Judge <HI>Fell,</HI> That <HI>now he &s;aw</HI> George <HI>was a true Prophet;</HI> &s;ince <HI>Oliver</HI> had by that Time di&s;&s;olved the Parliament.</P>

he went into the Market,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1653</NOTE> tho' he had been threatned, that if he came there he would meet with rude Treatment.

<P>On the Fir&s;t Day following, he went into the Steeple-hou&s;e, and after the Prie&s;t had done, he began to preach. Now the Prie&s;t going away, and the Magi&s;trate de&s;iring <HI>G.

So he went thither, and had a long Di&s;cour&s;e with them concerning Religion, and &s;hew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d them, that tho' they were great Profe&s;&s;ors (viz. <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and <HI>Independents)</HI> yet they were without the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they profe&s;&s;ed. But after a long Examination, they committed him to Pri&s;on as a Bla&s;phemer, an Heretick, and a Seducer. There he lay till the A&s;|&s;izes came on, and then all the Talk was, <HI>That he was to be hang'd:</HI> And the High Sheriff, <HI>Willfrey Law&s;on,</HI> was &s;o eager to have his Life taken away,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sheriff</HI> Law|&s;on.</NOTE> that he &s;aid, <HI>He him&s;elf would guard</HI> G.

But tho' both Judge and Magi&s;trates were contriving how they might put him to Death, yet the Judges Clark &s;tarted a Que&s;tion which puzzled them, and confounded their Councils, &s;o that he was not brought to a Trial, as was expected&punc; which however was contrary to Law. But &s;uch was their Envy again&s;t him, that the Jailor was ordered to put him among Thieves and Murderers, and &s;ome naugh|ty Women; which wicked Crew was &s;o lou&s;y, that one Woman was almo&s;t eaten to Death with Lice: But what made the Pri&s;on the wor&s;e, there was no Hou&s;e of Office to it, and in this na&s;ty Place, Men and Women were put together, again&s;t all Decency.

But the Under-Jailor did him all the Mi&s;chief he could. Once when he had been a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Grate to take in the Meat his Friends brought him, the Jailor fell a beating of him with a great Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gel, crying, <HI>Come out of the Window,</HI> tho' he was then far enough from it.

<P>Sometime after by another Motion he came to <HI>Furnei&s;s</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Furnei&s;s <HI>in</HI> Lanca&s;hire. <HI>Capt.</HI> Sands-<HI>Prie&s;t</HI> Lam|pitt.</NOTE> to the Hou&s;e of Captain <HI>Adam Sands,</HI> where he found a great Number of Profe&s;&s;ors gather'd, and Prie&s;t <HI>Lampitt</HI> preaching.

an&s;wered as the other, <HI>I &s;hall not &s;peak as long as this dumb Devil is in the Hou&s;e.</HI> Then the People cry'd, <HI>Lord, rebuke thee Satan, Lord, rebuke thee, Satan: What Manner of Spirit is this that &s;tops our Mini&s;ters Mouths?</HI> Then the Captain came to <HI>Myles,</HI> and taking him by the Hand, led him out of the Hou&s;e.

<P>Some Time after this Occurrence, <HI>Myles</HI> went to <HI>New-ca&s;tle,</HI> and there &s;aid to the Mayor, Rulers, and Prie&s;ts of that Town, <HI>That God's Anger was kindled again&s;t them, becau&s;e they had &s;hut the Kingdom of Heaven again&s;t Men, and would not enter them&s;elves, nor &s;uffer them that would.</HI> Be|cau&s;e of this he was impri&s;oned: But the Mayor being much troubled, &s;ent for the Sheriff, (for the&s;e two had committed <HI>Myles</HI> to Pri&s;on;) when come, he &s;aid to him, <HI>We have not done well in committing an innocent Man to Pri&s;on: Pray let us relea&s;e him.</HI> The Sheriff con&s;enting, <HI>Myles</HI> was &s;et at Liberty.

<P>About this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secular Tran&s;actions.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> in the Summer, General <HI>Cromwel</HI> had called a new Parliament, con&s;i&s;ting mo&s;tly (as hath been &s;aid by &s;ome) of Members of his own Choice; for it was a certain Number of Per&s;ons out of each County and City in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> nomi|nated by the Council of Officers, and &s;ent for to meet at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter:</HI> Into the Hands of the&s;e <HI>Cromwel</HI> delivered the Supreme Authority of the Nation, by an In&s;trument, or Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;igned by him&s;elf and the Officers; but the Authority of this Meeting la&s;ted &s;carce half a Year, as will be &s;aid in the Sequel.

The Parliament then cau&s;ed a Letter to be &s;ent down concerning him to the Sheriff, and other Magi&s;trates: And <HI>G.

He al&s;o wrote a &s;ignificant Letter to the Ju|&s;tices at <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> wherein he &s;hewed them plainly the Inju&s;tice of their Dealings, and the horrid Evil of Per&s;ecution, as having been always the Work of the fal&s;e Church.

The <HI>Bapti&s;t,</HI> who went along with him, had his Sword taken from him, and was &s;orely beaten with it; yet this did not frighten or di&s;courage him; and he not only left off the Wearing of a Sword; but al&s;o freely gave up the Inheritance of an Impropriation of Tythes.

<P>To relate all the Occurrences of this <HI>Robert Widders,</HI> would be too prolix; therefore I'll only &s;ay, that as he was very zealous in &s;peaking to the Prie&s;ts, &s;o he &s;uffered very much in his E&s;tate, becau&s;e for Con|&s;cience-&s;ake he refu&s;ed to pay them Tythes; and on that Account there was taken from him, at &s;undry Times, to the value of 143 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> be&s;ides what he &s;uffered for Meetings, and for <HI>Sunday</HI> Shillings, &s;o call'd, which al&s;o amounted to a con&s;iderable Sum. And this not only bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l him, but it was the Portion of many Hundreds, nay perhaps Thou&s;ands of tho&s;e of his Per&s;wa&s;ion: Wherefore I won't undertake to relate all that might be mention'd of this Kind; for that would be beyond my Reach. How|ever, by this that hath been &s;aid, may be &s;een, by what Means the <HI>Qua|kers,</HI> &s;o called, grew &s;o numerous in tho&s;e early Times. As on one Hand, there were rai&s;ed zealous Preachers; &s;o on the other, there were Abundance of People in <HI>England,</HI> who having &s;earched all Sects, could no where find Satisfaction for their hungry Souls. And the&s;e now un|der&s;tanding that God by his Light was &s;o near in their Hearts, began to take Heed thereunto, and &s;oon found, that this gave them far more Victory over the Corruption of their Minds, (under which they had long groaned) than all the &s;elf-will<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d Wor&s;hips which they with &s;ome Zeal had performed many Years. And be&s;ides tho&s;e that were thus pre|pared to receive a farther Manife&s;tation of the Way of Life, there were al&s;o many of a rude Life, who being prick'd to the Heart, and brought over by the Chri&s;tian Patience of the de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>Quakers,</HI> became as zea|lous in doing Good, as formerly they had been in working Evil.</P>
<P>But perhaps &s;ome will think it was very indecent that they went &s;o frequently to the Steeple-hou&s;es, and there &s;poke to the Prie&s;ts: But what&s;oever any may judge concerning this, it is certain that tho&s;e Teach|ers generally did not bring forth the Fruits of Godline&s;s, as was well known to tho&s;e who them&s;elves had been Prie&s;ts, and freely re&s;igned their Mini&s;try, thenceforth to follow Chri&s;t in the Way of his Cro&s;s; and the&s;e were none of the lea&s;t zealous again&s;t that Society among whom they formerly had mini&s;tred with an upright Zeal. Yet they were not for u&s;ing &s;harp Language again&s;t &s;uch Teachers, who, according to their Knowledge, feared God; but they levelled their Aim chiefly again&s;t tho&s;e who were only rich in Words, without bringing forth true Chri|&s;tian Fruits, and Works of Ju&s;tice. Hence it was, that one <HI>Thomas Curtis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. Curtis</HI> writes to Prie&s;t <HI>Wel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> of <HI>Banbury</HI></NOTE> who was formerly a Captain in the Parliament Army, but after|wards entred into the Society of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> wrote, in a Letter to <HI>Samuel Wells,</HI> Prie&s;t of <HI>Banbury,</HI> and a Per&s;ecutor of tho&s;e of that Per&s;wa&s;ion, among&s;t other Things, the&s;e Words; <HI>To thy Shame, remem|ber I know thee &s;candalous: How often ha&s;t thou &s;ate Evening after Evening at Cards, and &s;ometimes whole Nights playing, and &s;ometimes compelling me to play with thee for Money; yet then thou wa&s;t called of the World a Mini&s;ter; and now art thou turn'd Per&s;ecutor,</HI> &amp;c. None therefore need think it &s;trange, that tho&s;e called <HI>Quakers</HI> did look upon &s;uch Teachers as Hirelings: And
<PB N="75" REF="003104_0086_0FEFF3CB40E83168">
that there were not a few of that Sort, appeared plainly when King <HI>Charles</HI> the II. was re&s;tored; for tho&s;e who had formerly cry'd out again&s;t Epi&s;copacy, and its Liturgy, as fal&s;e and idolatrous, then be|came Turncoats, and put on the Surplice, to keep in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Livings and Benefices. But by &s;o doing, the&s;e Hypocrites lo&s;t not a few of their Auditors; for this opened the Eyes of many, who began to enquire into the Doctrine of the de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>Quakers,</HI> and &s;aw that they had a more &s;ure Foundation, and that this it was which made them &s;tand un&s;haken again&s;t the Fury of Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>Let us again take up the Thread of tho&s;e Tran&s;actions which con|cern <HI>G. Fox:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

Joh. iv. 17. Ch. xv. 15. Ch. iv. 18.</NOTE> &s;aid, <HI>Be ye perfect.</HI></Q> To this one of the Pro|fe&s;&s;ors an&s;wer'd, That <HI>Job</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Shall mortal Man be more pure than his Maker? The Heavens are not clear in his Sight. God charged his An|gels with Folly.</HI> But <HI>G. Fox</HI> &s;hew'd him his Mi&s;take, and told him, <Q>That it was not <HI>Job</HI> that &s;aid &s;o, but one of tho&s;e that contended again&s;t him.</Q> Then the Profe&s;&s;ors &s;aid, <HI>The outward Body was the Body of Death and Sin.</HI> But <HI>G. Fox</HI> replied, <Q>That <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> had each of them an outward Body, before the Body of Death and Sin got into them; and that Men would have Bodies, when the Body of Sin and Death was put off again, and they were renewed into the Image of God again by Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q></P>
<P>Thus <HI>G. Fox</HI> found almo&s;t every where Work, and pa&s;&s;ing to <HI>Hexam,</HI> he had a great Meeting there on the Top of a Hill. The Prie&s;t indeed had threatned, that he would come and oppo&s;e; but he came not.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> then travelling on, came into <HI>Cumberland,</HI> where he had a Meet|ing of many Thou&s;ands of People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Langlands&punc; Brigham.</NOTE> on a Hill near <HI>Langlands.</HI> Once he came into <HI>Brigham</HI> Steeple-hou&s;e, before the Prie&s;t was there, and de|clared the Truth to the People; but when the Prie&s;t came in, he began to oppo&s;e, but was wearied &s;o, that at length he went away. There being now al&s;o &s;everal others who preached the Doctrine of the inward Light of God which convinceth Man of Sin, the Number of tho&s;e Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the Light increa&s;ed greatly: And as it had been &s;aid at fir&s;t, <HI>That they &s;hould be de&s;troyed within a &s;hort Time;</HI> &s;o now the Prie&s;ts began to &s;ay, <HI>That they would eat out one another:</HI> For many of them, after Meetings, having a great Way to go, &s;taid at their Friends Hou&s;es by the Way, and &s;ometimes more than there were Beds to lodge in, &s;o that &s;ome lay on the Hay-Mows. This made &s;ome of the publick Church grow afraid, that this Ho&s;pitality would cau&s;e Poverty, and that when the&s;e Friends had eaten out one another, they would come to be maintained by the Pari&s;hes, and &s;o be chargeable to them. But it &s;ell out quite otherwi&s;e, for the&s;e People wore the more ble&s;&s;ed, and en|crea&s;ed, without falling into Want. This puts me mind of what one of the Daughters of Judge <HI>Thomas Fell</HI> once told me, <HI>viz.</HI> That her Father having been abroad, and coming home with his Servants, found the Shed &s;o full of the Hor&s;es of &s;trange Gue&s;ts, (for <HI>Margaret</HI> his Wife had cleared the Stable where they fir&s;t &s;tood, to make Room for her Husband's own Hor&s;es) that he &s;aid to his Wife, <HI>This was the Way to be eaten out, and that thus they them&s;elves &s;hould &s;oon be in Want of Hay.</HI> But

to this <HI>Margaret</HI> &s;aid in a Friendly Way, <HI>That &s;he did not belie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, when the Year was at an End, they &s;hould have the le&s;s for that.</HI> And it &s;o fell out; for this Year their Stock of Hay was &s;uch, that they &s;old a great Parcel of what they had in Abundance. Thus the Proverb was verify'd, That <HI>Charity doth not impoveri&s;h.</HI> The Truth of this was al&s;o experienced by tho&s;e called <HI>Quakers;</HI> for tho' many People at fir&s;t were &s;hy, and would not deal with them, becau&s;e of their Nonconfor|mity with the vulgar Salutation, and their &s;aying <HI>Thou</HI> and <HI>Thee</HI> to a &s;ingle Per&s;on, in&s;tead of <HI>You,</HI> &amp;c. in&s;omuch, that &s;ome that were Trade&s;|men, lo&s;t their Cu&s;tomers, and could hardly get Money enough to buy Bread: Yet this changed in Time, when People found by Experience they could better tru&s;t to the Words of the&s;e, than to that of tho&s;e of their own Per&s;ua&s;ion. Hence it was, that often when any came into a Town, and wanted &s;omething, they would ask, <HI>Where dwells a Draper, or Taylor, or Shoemaker,</HI> or any other Trade&s;man, <HI>that is a</HI> Quaker? But this &s;o exa&s;perated others, that they began to cry out, <HI>If we let the&s;e</HI> Quakers <HI>alone, they will take the Trade of the Nation out of our Hands.</HI> Now the Cau&s;e of their Trade's thus encrea&s;ing, was, becau&s;e they were found upright in their Dealing; for Integrity did then &s;hine out among them above many others: To this the true Fear of God led them, and to this they were exhorted from Time to Time. <HI>G. Fox</HI> al&s;o wrote a General Epi&s;tle to them, which was as followeth:</P>

And that every one in particular may &s;ee to, and take Care of the ordering and ruling of their own Family; that in the Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Wi&s;dom it may be governed, the Fear and Dread of the Lord in every one's Heart &s;et, that the Secrets of the Lord every one may come to receive, that Stewards of his Grace you may come to be, to di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en&s;e it to every one as they have Need; and &s;o in &s;avouring and right-di&s;cerning you may all be kept: That nothing, that is contrary to the pure Life of God, may be brought forth in you, or among you; but all that is contrary to it, may by it be judged: So that in Light, in Life and Love, ye may all live; and all that is contrary to the Light, and Life, and Love, may be brought to Judgment, and by that Light condemned. And that no fruitle&s;s Trees be among you; but all cut down and condemned by the Light, and ca&s;t into the Fire; &s;o that every one may bear and bring forth Fruit to God, and grow fruitful in his Knowledge, and in his Wi&s;dom.

So to the Lu&s;t yeild not the Eye, nor the Fle&s;h; for the Pride of Life &s;tands in That, which keeps out of the Love of the Father; and upon which his Judgments and Wrath remains, where the Love of the World is &s;ought after, and a Crown that is Mortal; in which Ground the Evil enters, which is cur&s;ed; which brings forth Briars and Thorns, where the Death reigns, and Tribulation and Angui&s;h is upon every Soul, and the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Tongue is heard: All which is by the Light condemned. And there the Earth is, which mu&s;t be removed. By the Light it is &s;een, and by the Power it is removed, and out of its Place it is &s;haken; to which the Thunders utter their Voices, before the My&s;teries of God be opened, and Je&s;us revealed. Therefore, all ye, who&s;e Minds are turn|ed to this Light (which brings Condemnation upon all tho&s;e Things before-mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, that are contrary to the Light) wait upon the Lord Je&s;us for the Crown, that is Immortal, and that fadeth not away.</P>

But when <HI>F. Howgill,</HI> and <HI>E.

<P>At <HI>London</HI> there is a Cu&s;tom in Summer-time, when the Evening ap|proaches, and Trade&s;men leave off working, that many lu&s;ty Fellows meet in the Fields to try their Skill and Strength in wre&s;tling, where generally a Multitude of People &s;tands gazing in a Round.

At length, none being bold enough to try, <HI>E. Burrough</HI> &s;tept into the Ring, commonly made up of all Sorts of People: And having look'd upon the Wre&s;tler with a &s;erious Countenance, the Man was not a little &s;urprized, in&s;tead of an airy Antagoni&s;t, to meet with a grave and awful young Man; and all &s;tood as it were amazed at this Sight, eagerly expecting what would be the I&s;&s;ue of this Combat. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was quite another Fight <HI>E. Burrough</HI> aim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d at.

With this Intention he began very &s;eriou&s;ly to &s;peak to the Standers by, and that with &s;uch a heart-piercing Power, that he was heard by this mixt Multitude with no le&s;s Attention than Admiration; for his Speech tended to turn them from Darkne&s;s to the Light, and from the Power of Satan to God. To effect this, he labour'd with convincing Words, &s;hewing, How God had not left him&s;elf without a Witne&s;s, but had given to Man a Mea&s;ure of his Grace, and enlighten'd every one with the Light of Chri&s;t. Thus he preached zealou&s;ly: And tho' many might look upon this as a Novelty, yet it was of &s;uch Effect, that &s;ome were convinced of the Truth; for he was a Breaker of &s;tony Hearts, and therefore, by a certain Author, not unju&s;tly called, <HI>A Son of Thunder;</HI> tho' he al&s;o omitted not in due Sea&s;on to &s;peak a Word of Con|&s;olation to tho&s;e that were of a broken Heart, and of a contrite Spirit: But to thunder again&s;t Sin and Iniquity was his peculiar Talent; in&s;o|much, that once preaching very zealou&s;ly in a Meeting, and perceiving there were &s;ome contrite Souls, that wanted &s;piritually refre&s;hing Food, he was heard to intimate, That tho' his pre&s;ent Speaking was not Milk for Babes, yet he would remember &s;uch a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, and admini&s;ter to them al&s;o; but now, <HI>He mu&s;t thre&s;h the Whore.</HI> And indeed he was one of

<P>Now in the &s;aid Letter, or Speech, we find Notice taken of <HI>Laws made concerning Religion:</HI> The&s;e I do not look upon as made by the In|duction of <HI>Cromwel,</HI> but &s;uch as were made in former Times, which he could have alter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d if he would have done it, as afterwards many Pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Laws were abrogated, under the Reign of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> as will be &s;aid in its proper Place.

a Stir, that the next Day more than five hundred People, as it was thought, were gather<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d together in a &s;editious Manner, &s;o that their Companions were &s;ee at Liberty.

Now the riotous Multitude did not &s;tick to ru&s;h violently into the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o call'd, at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> under a Pretence of preventing trea&s;onable Plottings.

This often caus'd a Tumult in the Town; and &s;ome &s;aid (not without good Rea&s;on) that the Apprentices dur&s;t not have left their Work, had not their Ma&s;ters given them Leave.

In the mean while the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, were kept in Pri&s;on, and it plainly appear'd, that the Order again&s;t unlawful A&s;&s;emblies was levell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d again&s;t their Meetings: And tho' the Magi&s;trates pretended that they mu&s;t an&s;wer for it to the Protector, if they did let the <HI>Quakers</HI> alone without di&s;turbing their Meetings, which, at that Time, for the mo&s;t Part, were &s;ilent, and no|thing was &s;poken but when, now and then, one of their Mini&s;ters from abroad vi&s;ited them; yet this was not at all agreeable with the <HI>Protector</HI>'s <HI>Speech</HI> he made on the 12th of the Month call'd <HI>September,</HI> to the Parliament in the painted Chamber, where he &s;poke the&s;e Words:</P>

Liberty of Con&s;cience is a Natural Right, and he that would have it, ought to give it, having Liberty to &s;ettle what he likes for the Publick. Indeed That hath been the Vanity of our Conte&s;ts: Every Sect &s;aith, Give me Liberty: But give it him, and to his Power he will not yield it to any Body el&s;e. Where is our Ingenuity? Truly that is a Thing that ought to be very reciprocal.

<P><HI>Cromwel</HI> &s;poke more in Confirmation hereof; and indeed he would have been a brave Man, if really he had performed what here he a&s;&s;erted with binding Arguments.

But by hearkening to the Flatteries of the Clergy, at length he lo&s;t his Credit, even with tho&s;e who with him had fought for the common Li|berty; and thus at la&s;t befell him after his Death, what he &s;eemed to have imprecated on him&s;elf in the foregoing Speech, if he departed from allowing due Liberty: For he farther &s;aid. <HI>That many of the People had been nece&s;&s;itated to go into the va&s;t howling Wilderne&s;s in</HI> New-England, <HI>for the Enjoyment of their Liberty; and that Liberty was a Fundamental of the Government;</HI> adding, <HI>that it had co&s;t much Blood to have it &s;o, and even the hazarding of all.</HI> And in the Conclu&s;ion he &s;aid, <HI>That he could &s;ooner be willing to be rolled into his Grave, and buried with Infamy, than give his Con&s;ent to the wilful throwing away of that Government, &s;o te&s;tified unto in the Fundamentals of it.</HI> Now, who knows not what infamy befel him af|terwards, when in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d.

<P>But I return now to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> where &s;everal were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pt in Pri&s;on &s;till, and no Liberty granted them; nay, they were even charged with what they utterly denied them&s;elves to be guilty of: Among the&s;e, one <HI>John Worring</HI> was accu&s;ed of having called the Prie&s;t, <HI>Samuel Grimes, a Devil:</HI> But <HI>Worring</HI> denied this, tho' he did not &s;tick to &s;ay, <HI>He could prove &s;omewhat like it by his own Words.</HI> And it being ask'd him, <HI>How?</HI> He an&s;wer'd, That <HI>the Prie&s;t had &s;aid at the Meeting, that in all Things he did, be &s;inned; and if in all Things, then at well in his Preaching, as in other Things; and he that &s;inneth, is of the Devil.

<P><HI>G.

<P>The particular Occurrences that befel <HI>G. Fox,</HI> when he was at Liberty in <HI>London,</HI> I pa&s;s by.

In the mean while the Number of his Friends increa&s;ed exceedingly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

He wrote about that Time &s;everal Papers, one of which was again&s;t Pride, gawdy Apparel, and the World's Fa&s;hions.</P>
<P>I don't find, that about this Time there was at <HI>London</HI> any Per&s;ecu|tion from the Magi&s;trates, but in other Places there was: And it was in this Year that <HI>Anne,</HI> the Wife of <HI>John Audland,</HI> coming into a Steeple-hou&s;e at <HI>Banbury</HI> &s;aid, after the Prie&s;t had ended, <HI>That tho&s;e that were without the Doctrine of Chri&s;t, tho' they &s;aid,</HI> the Lord liveth, <HI>yet &s;poke fal&s;ely, ac|cording to</HI> Jer. v. 2.

<P>The Year drew now to an End,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Tran&s;|actions.</NOTE> and <HI>Cromwel</HI> concluded a Peace with the united <HI>Netherlands;</HI> to get Things the more clear at home, it &s;eems he endeavour'd to remove Troubles abroad.

Then <HI>Parnel</HI> was hurried into a Hou&s;e, and &s;ome of his Friends engaged, that he &s;hould be forth-coming when their Wor&s;hip was done. And accordingly he appeared where four Ju&s;tices, and &s;ix or &s;even Prie&s;ts were met together. Then Ju&s;tice <HI>Wa|kering</HI> pull'd his Hat off his Head, and threw it away; and they que|&s;tion'd him concerning many Things; all which he an&s;wer'd, with ma|ny frivilous Que&s;tions ask'd to en&s;nare him. At la&s;t he was committed to the common Jail at <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> where none of his Friends were &s;uffered to come to him. The Time of the Se&s;&s;ions at <HI>Chelmsford</HI> being come, he, with &s;everal Felons and Murderers was fa&s;tned to a Chain, and thus led about eighteen Miles thro' the Country, remaining chain'd both Night and Day. Being then brought into the Court before Judge <HI>Hills,</HI> the Jailor took off his Hat, and ca&s;t it upon the Floor. Then the Clerk read his Indictment, and asked him, <HI>If he was guilty?</HI> To which he &s;aid, That <HI>he denied all Guilt;</HI> and he called for his Accu&s;ers. The Judge then &s;aid, <HI>he might &s;ee them;</HI> and that he ought to &s;ay, <HI>Guilty or not Guilty.</HI> On which <HI>Parnel</HI> told him, <HI>He was not Guilty.</HI> Then a Jury of twelve Men was call'd; their Foreman was a Drunkard: Prie&s;t <HI>Willis</HI> was al&s;o call'd, who &s;wore again&s;t him, and &s;o did two Ju&s;tices; one of their Men &s;wearing, That <HI>they would &s;peak nothing again&s;t him but the Truth.</HI> The Accu&s;ations were, <HI>That in a riotous Manner he did enter into the Pari&s;h Church at</HI> Great Cogge&s;hall; <HI>that he there did &s;tand up, and told the Mini&s;ter,</HI> he bla&s;phemed, <HI>and &s;poke fal&s;ly, u&s;ing many other reproachful Words again&s;t him: And that he could not give a good Account where he was la&s;t &s;ettled, or of his Life and Conver&s;ation, appearing to be an idle Per&s;on.</HI> He was al&s;o accu&s;ed <HI>with Contempt of the Magi&s;tracy and of the Mini&s;try.</HI> To this he an&s;wer'd, <HI>That he no Ways in a riotous Manner enter'd the Steeple-hou&s;e, but came thither quietly, and alone: For being followed by &s;everal Boys that would have come in after him, he bad them go in before, rather than to go in di&s;orderly, whereby to occa&s;ion any Di&s;turbance. That he had &s;aid to Prie&s;t</HI> Willis, He bla&s;phemed, <HI>by &s;aying,</HI> The Church in God was Non|&s;en&s;e, <HI>he denied not; but did not own him&s;elf to be a Vagabond and idle Per&s;on. And he did not think it indecent, to call an unju&s;t Judge,</HI> unrigh|teous; <HI>a Per&s;ecutor,</HI> Per&s;ecutor; <HI>and a Deceiver,</HI> Deceiver. Thus <HI>Parnel</HI> pleaded his Cau&s;e. Yet the Judge &s;aid to the Jury, <HI>That if they did not find him Guilty, the Sin would lie upon their Heads;</HI> thus condemning the Pri&s;oner before the Jury were entered into Deliberation. Then <HI>J. Parnel</HI> began to &s;peak, to inform them concerning his Cau&s;e, but the Judge would not &s;uffer him, tho' one of the Jury de&s;ired it. After Con&s;ultation, the Jury had nothing to lay to his Charge, but a Paper in which he had an&s;wered the <HI>Mittimus,</HI> tho' he had already owned this Paper to be his Writing. But in that they were at a Lo&s;s, becau&s;e in the Indictment he was accu&s;ed of a Riot: Yet the Judge and the Clerk &s;trove to draw &s;ome Words from the Foreman, which the other Jury|men did not con&s;ent to, and he him&s;elf was unwilling to an&s;wer fully to their Que&s;tions. Then <HI>J. Parnel</HI> was made to withdraw; and being call'd in again, the Judge fined him to the Value of about For|ty Pounds, <HI>for Contempt of the Magi&s;tracy and Mini&s;try;</HI> for he &s;aid, <HI>The</HI> Lord Protector <HI>had charged him to puni&s;h &s;uch Per&s;ons as &s;hould contemn ei|ther Magi&s;tracy or Mini&s;try.</HI> Hereupon <HI>J.

Then they put him into a Hole under|neath the other; for there were two Rows of &s;uch vaulted Holes in the Wall. This Hole was called the Oven, and &s;o little, that &s;ome Ba|kers Ovens have been bigger, tho' not &s;o High. Here (the Door be|ing &s;hut) was &s;carcely any Air, there being no Window or Hole.

<P>Then the Court fined them five Pounds a-piece;<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are fined and &s;ent to <HI>Bridewel.</HI></NOTE> and they were to go to the Hou&s;e of Correction till Payment, and to find Sureties for their good Behaviour: And for refu&s;ing to take the Oath, the Court threatned to &s;end into the North to &s;eize on their E&s;tates.

<P>What is &s;aid here of refu&s;ing to be try'd by the Country, was a no|torious Untruth; and as to finding Sureties, that &s;eemed of little Mo|ment; for tho' the giving of Security had been offer'd before when they were taken Pri&s;oners, yet that was not accepted of; and the Mayor <HI>John Page,</HI> had the Boldne&s;s to a&s;&s;ert, that they refu&s;ed to give Security, as will appear by the Warrant by which he &s;ent them to the common Jail in <HI>Exeter,</HI> whereof the following is a true Copy.</P>

thereunto, and al&s;o his Highne&s;s's late Proclamation again&s;t <HI>Quakers;</HI> and they &s;till refu&s;ing to give Bail for their Appearance as afore&s;aid, went from hence to the Jail at <HI>Exon</HI> on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> la&s;t. Indeed, <HI>Sir,</HI> their Carriage here was not becoming Men, much le&s;s Chri&s;tians; and be&s;ides their Contempt of Au|thority, all the while they were in Pri&s;on, they never &s;ought God by Prayer at any Time, nor de&s;ired a Ble&s;&s;ing on any Creature they received, or gave Thanks for them. And the&s;e very Men were about two Months pa&s;t taken up by Colonel <HI>Cupplefton,</HI> High Sheriff of our County, and after fourteen Days Re&s;traint, were &s;ent away by him for <HI>Taunton,</HI> from Tithing to Tithing, as by their own Examination; and they &s;hew no Occa&s;ion they have to come to the&s;e Parts. They are by Profe&s;&s;ion <HI>Quakers,</HI> but Husbandmen by their Calling: One of them is a <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> Man, the other of <HI>We&s;tmorland;</HI> and they left their Families, Relations, and Callings about three Months &s;ince, as they &s;ay, and do not work, nor employ them&s;elves in their Calling, to procure them&s;elves a Livelihood, but wander up and down in all Parts, to vent their wicked Opinions, and di&s;|cover their irregular Practices in the Breach of Peace, and Di&s;turbance of good People.

</LETTER>
<P>That General <HI>Disbrow</HI> was but little &s;atisfied with this Letter, &s;eems not improbable, becau&s;e enquiring into the Matter, he let others have a Copy of it, &s;o that <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Myles</HI> wrote an An&s;wer to it; and it was al&s;o &s;ome Time after given out in publick Print at <HI>London,</HI> by <HI>Giles Calvert,</HI> with other Writings relating thereunto. Now as to what is &s;aid in this Letter of <HI>His Highne&s;s's Proclamation again&s;t</HI> Quakers, it was a gro&s;s Untruth; for in the Proclamation the <HI>Quakers</HI> were not named; but it was again&s;t the Di&s;turbing of Chri&s;tians in their A&s;&s;emblies; and be&s;ides, the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, judged that their publick Wor&s;hip was permitted them by the 37th Article of the In&s;trument of Government, which &s;aid, <HI>That all that profe&s;s Faith in God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;hall not be re|&s;trained from, but be protected in the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Faith, and Exerci&s;e of their Religion,</HI> &amp;c. As concerning <HI>their Contempt of Authority,</HI> the Mayor charged them with, it was nothing el&s;e, but that for Con&s;cience-&s;ake they could not take off their Hats to the Magi&s;trates; neither did they give that Honour to any other but God alone. And as to what was &s;aid, <HI>That all the While they were in Pri&s;on, they never &s;ought God by Prayer,</HI> &amp;c. This was no other Matter, than that they did not follow the Formal Way of Prayers; for they were indeed religious Men, who often prayed to God, and gave him Thanks, tho' they were repre&s;ented in the Letter as very wicked Men, and Vagabonds that had left their Calling, and wander'd up and down the Country; altho' it was well known that they were hone&s;t Men, that travell'd on Hor&s;eback, and lying at the be&s;t inns

on the Road, and paying for what they received there. And therefore after they had got a Copy of the &s;aid Letter, they writ a large Letter to the Mayor <HI>Page,</HI> and &s;hewed him his abominable Untruths, and told him, that <HI>they had been moved &s;everal Times in Pri&s;on, as well as out of Pri&s;on, to go to Prayers, and to give Thanks for the Ble&s;&s;ings of God, which they received.</HI> And in the Conclu&s;ion of their Letter, they &s;ignified, <HI>That they would not render Railing for Railing; but</HI> (&s;aid they) <HI>in the Spirit of Love and Meekne&s;s we exhort you all to repent, and fear to offend the Lord,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now as concerning the <HI>provoking Words again&s;t</HI> George Brooks, for which they had been fined, it hath been &s;aid already what they were; but this <HI>Brooks</HI> was of a di&s;&s;olute Life, and a debauch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d Fellow, having for his Drunkenne&s;s not only been turned out of the Frigates in which he had &s;erved, but al&s;o once in the Ship <HI>Nightingale,</HI> ignominiou&s;ly expos'd with a Quarter Can about his Neck, as appears by the following Te&s;ti|monies.</P>

<P>In this Year <HI>Edward Burrough</HI> wrote a Letter to the Protector, wherein he told him, <HI>That the Lord's Controver&s;y was again&s;t him, becau&s;e he had not been faithful in God's Work; but that he had taken his Re&s;t and Ea&s;e upon a lofty Mountain of Pride and Vain Glory, having &s;et up him&s;elf to be wor&s;hipped, and exalting his own Horn, without giving Glory and Honour to God.</HI> Moreo|ver, <HI>that he had not perform'd his Vows made to the Lord in the Day of Di&s;tre&s;s; and that now he &s;uffered grievous Oppre&s;&s;ion, Cruelty, and Tyranny to be acted in his Name by unju&s;t Impri&s;onments, and Per&s;ecution of the Lord's People. That therefore the Lord would bring his Judgments upon him, except be did re|pent.</HI> How boldly &s;oever <HI>Burrough</HI> wrote in this Letter to <HI>Cromwel,</HI> yet I do not find that he &s;hewed him&s;elf angry becau&s;e of it: But yet he heark|ened too much to the Flatteries of tho&s;e Teachers, who being now en|tred into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the <HI>Epi&s;copalians,</HI> exalted him as their Idol, by their Applau&s;e: And he revering them as &s;uch who could &s;trengthen his Authority with the People, winked at the grievous Per&s;ecution, by their In&s;tigation carried on again&s;t the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called.</P>
<P>In the mean While there were many Malecontents, who could not bear that <HI>Cromwel</HI> &s;hould force the Members of Parliament to con&s;ent to make no Change in the Government then e&s;tabli&s;h'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Tran&s;|actions.</NOTE> and would not &s;uffer any one to &s;it in the Hou&s;e, without having promi&s;ed by Writing not to propo&s;e or give his Con&s;ent there to the Change of the &s;aid Go|vernment.

publick A&s;&s;ertor of the People's Liberties and Freedoms; for which he had been pro&s;cuted at Law, <HI>viz.</HI> once in the Year 1645, when he was impri&s;oned as guilty of Trea&s;on, but was di&s;charged; and afterwards in the Year 1649, when having publi&s;h'd &s;everal Books, to expo&s;e to the Publick, the arbitrary Power he thought was exerci&s;ed in the Government, he was confined in the Tower: And after having been Pri&s;oner above &s;even Months, was impeach'd of High Trea&s;on: But he &s;o vigorou&s;ly de|fended his Cau&s;e, that tho' &s;trong Per&s;wa&s;ions had been u&s;ed to move the Jury to bring him in guilty, yet he &s;o far prevailed, that at length he was &s;et at Liberty again; tho' I find that once he was whipt for a Crime laid to his Charge, of which he gloried publickly. And when <HI>Cromwel</HI> had u&s;urp'd the &s;upreme Power, <HI>Lilburn</HI> made bold to charge him, both by Word of Mouth, and by Writing, with Fal&s;ene&s;s and Tyranny; and he went on at that Rate, that <HI>Cromwel,</HI> fore&s;eeing that, it this Man con|tinu'd thus to expo&s;e his Doings, he &s;hould not be able to maintain his Credit and Authority, ordered him to be taken into Cu&s;tody and im|peach'd of High Trea&s;on. When <HI>Lilburn,</HI> thus accu&s;ed, appeared at the Bar, he behaved him&s;elf with that Undauntedne&s;s, and &s;o defended his Cau&s;e, that, he &s;eemed le&s;s to plead for his Life, than for the Freedom of his Country: And boldly an&s;wering what was objected to him, &s;aid, <Q>That what he had done, was not only no High Trea&s;on, but the Go|vernment was &s;uch, that no High Trea&s;on could be committed again&s;t it; and that therefore all true <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> were obliged to oppo&s;e the Tyranny that was exerci&s;ed.</Q> He al&s;o &s;aid, <Q>That having been once much in Favour with <HI>Cromwel,</HI> he might have attained to great Prefer|ment, if he would have been quiet; but that he having thought this unlawful, it was now re&s;olved to have his Life taken away; which he did not fear, becau&s;e he a&s;&s;erted a good Cau&s;e.</Q> Thus vigorou&s;ly <HI>Lilburn</HI> pleaded, and he defended his Cau&s;e with &s;uch &s;trong Arguments, that the Jury brought him in <HI>not guilty,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Endeavours of the Judges to the contrary. Now, tho' according to Law he mu&s;t have been &s;et at Liberty, yet <HI>Cromwel</HI> would not con&s;ent to it, but kept him Pri&s;oner; and becau&s;e he indeed feared him, as one that would weaken his Government, he ordered him to be carried from one Pri&s;on to another, till at length he came to be confined in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Dover,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who while Pri&s;oner in <HI>Dover-Ca&s;tle</HI> comes to be acquainted with <HI>L.

<P>The&s;e Words were &s;o acceptable to <HI>Lilburn,</HI> that repeating them in his Letter to her, he an&s;wered thus, after many other Pa&s;&s;ages:</P>

But being ad|vanc'd in the Time, I go therefore back a little, and intend in the Se|quel, to give a more circum&s;tantial De&s;cription of <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Death.</P>
<P>And thus I conclude this Book with the Year 1655, in which Year there was a Plot of the Royali&s;ts again&s;t <HI>Cromwel;</HI> and in <HI>Nottingham|&s;hire,</HI> they had already &s;urpri&s;ed &s;ome Places; and towards the We&s;t the City of <HI>Salisbury.</HI> The young King <HI>(Charles)</HI> was now come from <HI>Cologne,</HI> into <HI>Zealand,</HI> to be the nearer if the Attempt &s;ucceeded. But his Time of ruling was not yet come; for the <HI>Cavaliers</HI> were &s;oon forc'd to give Way to the Power of <HI>Cromwel:</HI> And the De&s;ign being thus qua&s;h'd, King <HI>Charles</HI> return'd to <HI>Cologne.</HI> In the mean While <HI>Cromwel,</HI> to rai&s;e his E&s;teem abroad, &s;ent a Fleet under Admiral <HI>Penn</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and another under the Command of Admiral <HI>Blake</HI> towards the Medi|terranean Sea.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY Of the CHIRSTIAN PEOPLE called QUAKERS.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1656</NOTE> The FOURTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>NEAR the Beginning of the Year 1656.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> goes to <HI>Surry, Chiche&s;ter, Port&s;mouth,</HI> and <HI>Pool,</HI> where <HI>W. Baily a Bap|ti&s;t</HI> is convin|ced and comes to have a pub|lick Te&s;timony, Thence to <HI>Southampton</HI> and <HI>Dorche&s;|ter,</HI> where he di&s;cour&s;es with the Bap|ti&s;ts about Water Bap|ti&s;m, and many &s;ub&s;tan|tial People are convinc'd.</NOTE> <HI>G. Fox</HI> went from <HI>London,</HI> to <HI>Surry, Chiche&s;ter, Port&s;mouth,</HI> and <HI>Pool,</HI> where <HI>Wil|liam Baily,</HI> a <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> Teacher, and &s;ome others were convinced by <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Mini&s;try, and entred into the Society of tho&s;e called <HI>Qua|kers,</HI> among whom <HI>Baily</HI> afterwards became an eminent Mini&s;ter. From <HI>Pool, G. Fox</HI> went to <HI>Southampton</HI> and <HI>Dorche&s;ter,</HI> where he de&s;ired of the <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> to have their Meeting-Hou&s;e to meet in: But they re|fu&s;ing, he &s;ent them Word, <HI>That they might come to his Inn, if they plea&s;ed.</HI> Many of them came with their Teacher, and they fell into a Di&s;cour&s;e about Water-Bapti&s;m. <HI>G. Fox</HI> asked them, <HI>Whether they could &s;ay they were &s;ent of God to baptize People, as</HI> John <HI>was? And whether they had the &s;ame Spirit and Power, that the Apo&s;tles had?</HI> They &s;aid, <HI>They had not.</HI> Then he asked them, <HI>How many Powers then are? Whether there are any more, than the Power of God, and the Power of the Devil?</HI> And they &s;aid, <HI>There was not any other Power than tho&s;e two.</HI> Then &s;aid <HI>G. Fox, If you have not the Power of God, that the Apo&s;tles had, then you act by the Power of the Devil.</HI> And his &s;peaking was of &s;uch Effect, that many Sub&s;tantial People were convinced that Night. Next Morning when he was pa&s;&s;ing away, the Bapti&s;ts began to &s;hake the Du&s;t from off their Feet after him. <HI>What,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>in the Power of Darkne&s;s! We who are in the Power of God, &s;hake off the Du&s;t of our Feet again&s;t you.</HI> Thus leaving <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> he came to <HI>Weymouth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Then to <HI>Wey|mouth,</HI> where at a Prie&s;t's Hou&s;e many receive his Te|&s;timony; and al&s;o a Captain remarkable for Laughter.</NOTE> where enquiring after the &s;ober People, about Four&s;core of them gathered together at a Prie&s;t's Hou&s;e; and mo&s;t of them were turned to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who had enlightened them with his divine Light, by which they were reproved of their Sins. There was at that Time a Captain of Hor&s;e in the Town, who rode about &s;even Miles out of Town with <HI>G. Fox:</HI> This Cap|tain was of &s;uch a merry Temper, and &s;o exceedingly given to Laugh|ter, that <HI>G. Fox</HI> &s;everal Times &s;poke very &s;eriou&s;ly to him about it; but it was become &s;o cu&s;tomary to him, that he would laugh al|mo&s;t at any Thing he &s;aw. But <HI>G. Fox</HI> &s;till admoni&s;h'd him to Gravi|ty, and the Fear of the Lord; and of this he &s;poke to him again when they parted. The next Time <HI>G. Fox</HI> &s;aw him, the Captain told him, <HI>That when he &s;poke to him at parting, the Power of the Lord &s;o &s;truck him, that before he got home, he was &s;erious enough, and had left his Laughing.</HI> He indeed became a &s;erious and good Man; and being convinced of the Truth, died in the real Profe&s;&s;ion thereof.</P>
<P>For Brevities-Sake I don't intend to mention all the Places <HI>G. Fox</HI> pa&s;t thro',<NOTE PLACE="marg">Has good &s;er|vice at Kings|bridge.</NOTE> much le&s;s all his Occurrences. At <HI>Kingsbridge</HI> he had good Ser|vice; and returning in the Evening to his Inn, and there being many People drinking, he was moved to go among&s;t them, and to direct them <Q>To the Light which Chri&s;t, the heavenly Man, had enlightened them withal; by which Light they might &s;ee all their evil Ways, Words.

and Deeds: and by the &s;ame Light they might al&s;o &s;ee Chri&s;t Je&s;us their Saviour.</Q> But this Di&s;cour&s;e did not plea&s;e the Inn-keeper, &s;eeing it hindred his Gue&s;ts from drinking: And hearing <HI>G. Fox</HI> &s;peak &s;o much of the Light, he &s;natcht away the Candle, and &s;aid, <HI>Come, here is Light for you, to go into your Chamber.</HI> The next Day <HI>G.

<P>By this Mittimus it appears under what odd Pretences the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, were committed to Pri&s;on; for &s;uch Rea&s;ons as are mentioned therein, might be found and pickt up at any Time.

And tho' many were greatly enraged again&s;t them, and expected that the&s;e Pri&s;oners, who <HI>Thou'd and Thee'd</HI> all, and did not put off their Hats to any Man, &s;hould at the A&s;&s;izes be condemned to be hang'd, if they did not pay that Re&s;pect to the Bench; yet there were many friendly People, that out of &s;everal Parts of the Country came to vi&s;it them; for it was about nine Weeks from the Time of their Commitment to the A&s;&s;izes; by Rea&s;on of which &s;everal got Opportunity to &s;peak with them, which had that good Effect, that many were convinced of the Truth of the Doctrine held forth by them.</P>
<P>At the Time of the A&s;&s;izes Abundance of People came from far and near to hear the Trial of the <HI>Quakers;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rought into Court at the A&s;&s;izes, are examined by Judge <HI>Glyn,</HI> with whom <HI>G.

Being brought into the Court, <HI>G.

And if the Law of <HI>England</HI> doth command any &s;uch Thing, &s;hew me that Law, either written or printed.</Q> The Judge then growing angry, &s;aid, <HI>I do not carry my Law-Books on my Back.</HI> But &s;aid G. Fox, <HI>Where is it printed in any Statute-Book, that I may read it?</HI> At this the judge &s;aid, <HI>Take him away, Prevaricator! I ll ferk him.</HI> Then the Pri&s;oners were taken away, and put among the Thieves. But pre&s;ent|ly after the Judge call'd to the Jailor, <HI>Bring them up again.</HI> This being done, <HI>Come,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>Where had they Hats from</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>to</HI> Daniel? <HI>Come an&s;wer me; I have you fa&s;t now.</HI> To this <HI>G. Fox</HI> replied, <HI>Thou may&s;t read in the Third of</HI> Daniel, <HI>that the three Children were ca&s;t into the fiery Furnace, by</HI> Nebuchadnezzar's <HI>Command, with their Coats, their Ho&s;e, and their Hats on.</HI> This plain In&s;tance &s;topt him; &s;o that not having any Thing el&s;e to &s;ay, He cried again, <HI>Take them away Jailor.</HI> Accordingly they were taken away, and being thru&s;t among the Thieves, they were kept there a great While, and at length carried again to Pri&s;on: But in the Afternoon they were brought up again into the Court. <HI>G. Fox</HI> &s;eeing the Jurymen there, gave them a Paper which he had written again&s;t Swearing. This Pa|per pa&s;&s;ing from the Jury to the Ju&s;tices, they pre&s;ented it to the Judge; and he bid the Clerk give <HI>G. Fox</HI> that Paper, and then asked him, <HI>Whether that &s;editious Paper was his?</HI> To which he &s;aid, <HI>If they would read it in open Court, that he might hear it, if it was his, he would own it, and &s;tand by it.</HI> The Judge now would have <HI>G.

But he de&s;ired again, <HI>That it might be read, that all in the Court might hear it, and judge whether there was any Se|dition in it, or no; for if there were, he was willing to &s;uffer for it.</HI> At length the Clerk of the A&s;&s;izes read it with an audible Voice; and when he had done, <HI>G. Fox</HI> &s;aid, <HI>It was his Paper, and he would own it; and &s;o might they too, except they would deny the Scripture: For was it not Scripture Language, and the

Words and Commands of Chri&s;t and the Apo&s;tles, which all true Chri&s;tians ought to obey?</HI> Then they let fall that Subject, and the Judge &s;peaking again about the Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Pri&s;oners, bid the Jailor, <HI>take them off.</HI> Then they asked, <HI>What they had lain in Pri&s;on for the&s;e nine Weeks, &s;eeing now nothing was objected again&s;t them, but what concerned their Hats? And;</HI> &s;aid G. Fox, <HI>as for Putting off our Hats, that was the Honour which God would lay in the</HI> Du&s;t, <HI>tho' they made &s;o much ado about it: The Honour which is of Men, and which Men &s;eek one of another is the Mark of &V;n|believers:</HI> For how can ye believe, <HI>&s;aith Chri&s;t,</HI> who receive Honour one of another, and &s;eek not the Honour that cometh from God only? <HI>And Chri&s;t &s;aith al&s;o,</HI> I receive not Honour from Men, <HI>and all true Chri&s;tians &s;hould be of his Mind.</HI> Then the Judge made a Speech, <HI>How he repre&s;ented the Lord</HI> Protector's <HI>Per&s;on; and how he had made him Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of</HI> England, <HI>and &s;ent him to come that Circuit; &amp;c.</HI> Thereupon the Pri&s;oners de&s;ired him, <HI>That he would do them Ju|&s;tice for their fal&s;e Impri&s;onment, which they had &s;uffered nine Weeks.</HI> But in&s;tead thereof, an Indictment was read again&s;t them, but &s;o full of Untruths, that <HI>G Fox</HI> thought it had been again&s;t &s;ome of the Thieves; for it contained, <HI>That they came by Force and Arms, and in an ho&s;tile Manner into the Court;</HI> whereas they were brought there as Pri&s;oners; which made him &s;ay, <HI>It was all fal&s;e.</HI> And &s;till they cried for Ju&s;tice for their fal&s;e lmpri&s;onment, being taken up in their Jour|ney without Cau&s;e, by Major <HI>Ceely.</HI> Then this <HI>Peter Ceely,</HI> who as a Ju&s;tice of Peace &s;at al&s;o on the Bench,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fooli&s;h malice of Ma|jor <HI>Ceely.</HI></NOTE> &s;aid to the Judge, <HI>May it plea&s;e you,</HI> My Lord, <HI>This Man, (pointing to <HI>G.

At Night &s;ome friendly People of the Town brought them a Candle, and a little Straw; of which they were about to burn a little to take away the Stink.

In this Man|ner they were forc'd to &s;tand all Night, for they could not &s;it down, the Place being &s;o filthy.

That this Jailor was &s;o de&s;perately wicked, is not &s;o much to be wondred at, &s;ince (as they were inform|ed) he had been a Thief, and was on that Account burnt both in the Hand and on the Shoulder; and the Under-Jailor in like Man|ner: Their Wives had al&s;o been burnt in the Hand. It was not at all &s;trange then, that the Pri&s;oners &s;uffererd mo&s;t grievou&s;ly from &s;uch a wicked Crew: But it was more to be wondered at, that Colonel <HI>Bennet,</HI> a <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cher, having purchas'd the Jail and Lands belonging to the Ca&s;tle, had there placed this Head Jailor.

<P>There lived then at <HI>London</HI> one <HI>Robert Rich</HI> a Merchant (a very bold Man) who wrote a Letter to the Parliament, wherein he &s;hewed what was Bla&s;phemy; and on the 15th or <HI>December</HI> &s;everal Copies thereof were deliver'd to particular Members; and in that which was given to the Speaker, the&s;e Words were written at the Bottom, <HI>If I may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave Liberty of tho&s;e that &s;it in Parliament, I do here attend at their Door, and am ready, out of the Scriptures of Truth, to &s;hew, that not any Thing</HI> J.

<P>The Parliament, after Judgment was concluded, re&s;olved that the Speaker &s;hould be authoriz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to i&s;&s;ue his Warrants to the Sheriffs of <HI>Lon|don</HI> and <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> the Sheriff of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and Governour of <HI>Bridewell,</HI> to &s;ee the &s;aid Judgment put in Execution: But by &s;ome it was que&s;tion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, whether this was a &s;ufficient Warrant, unle&s;s the Protector concurr'd in the Matter; but he &s;eemed unwilling to meddle with it.

<P>The 18th of <HI>December, J.

<P><PB N="143" REF="003104_0154_0FEFF4735DAD61B0">And all tho&s;e ranting wild Spirits, which then gathered about me in that Time of Darkne&s;s; and all their wild Actions and wicked words again&s;t the Honour of God, and his pure Spirit and People; I deny that bad Spirit, the Power and the Works thereof; and as far as I gave Advantage, thro' Want of Judgment, for that evil Spirit in any to ari&s;e, I take &s;hame to my &s;elf ju&s;tly; having formerly had Power over that Spirit, in Judgment and Di&s;cerning, wherever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was; which Darkne&s;s came over me thro' Want of Watchfulne&s;s and Obedience to the pure Eye of God, and diligently minding the Reproof of Life, which condemns the adulterous Spirit. So the Adver&s;ary got Advantage, who cea&s;es not to &s;eek to devour; and being taken captive from the true Light, I was walking in the Night where none can work, as a wandring Bird fit for a Prey. And if the Lord of all my Mercies had not re&s;cu'd me, I had peri&s;hed, for I was as one appointed to Death and De&s;truction, and there was none could deliver me. And this I confe&s;s, that God my be ju&s;tified in his Judgment, and magnified in his Mercies without End, who did not for&s;ake his Captive in the Night, even when his Spirit was daily provoked and grieved; but hath brought me forth to give Glory to his Name for ever. And it is in my Heart to confe&s;s to God, and before Men, my Folly and Offence in that Day: Yet were there many Things formed again&s;t me in that Day to take away my Life, and bring Scandal upon the Truth, of which I am not guilty at all; as that Accu&s;ation, as if I had committed Adultery with &s;ome of tho&s;e Women who came with us from <HI>Exeter-Pri&s;on,</HI> and al&s;o tho&s;e who were with me at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> the Night before I &s;uffered there; of both which Accu&s;ations I am clear before God, who kept me in that Day both in Thought and Deed, as to all Women, as a Child, God is my Record. And this I mention in particular (hearing of &s;ome who &s;till cea&s;e not to reproach therewith God's Truth and People) that the Mouth of Enmity might be &s;hut from Evil-&s;peaking, tho' this toucheth not my Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>And that Report, as tho' I had rai&s;ed <HI>Dorcas Erbury</HI> from the Dead car|nally, this I deny al&s;o, and condemn that Te&s;timony to be out of the Truth; tho' that Power that quickens the Dead, I deny not, which is the Word of eternal Life. And this I give forth, that it may go as far as the Offence again&s;t the Spirit of Truth hath gone abroad, that all Burdens may be taken off with the Truth, and the Truth cleared thereby, and the true Light, and all that walk therein, and the Deeds of Darkne&s;s be condemned; and that all that are in Darkne&s;s, may not act in the Night, but &s;tay upon God, who dwells in the Light, who with the Workers of Iniquity hath no Fellow&s;hip; which had I done, when fir&s;t Darkne&s;s came upon me, and not been led by others, I had not run again&s;t the Rock to be broken, which &s;o long had born me, and of whom I had &s;o largely drunk, and of which I now drink in Mea&s;ure; to whom be the Glory of all, and to him mu&s;t every Tongue confe&s;s, as Judge and Saviour, God over all, ble&s;&s;ed for ever.</P>

And after I was led out from them, the Lord God of my Life &s;ent divers of his Servants with his Word after me, for my Return; all which was rejected; yea, the Provocati|on of that Time of Temptation was exceeding great again&s;t the pure Love of God; yet he left me not; for after I had given my &s;elf under that Power, and Darkne&s;s was above, my Adver&s;ary &s;o prevailed, that all Things were turned and perverted again&s;t my right Seeing or &V;nder&s;tanding; only a &s;ecret Hope and Faith I had in my God which I had &s;erved, that he would bring me thro' it, and to the End of it, and that I &s;hould again &s;ee the Day of my Redemption from under it all; and this quieted my Soul in my greate&s;t Tribulation.</HI></P>

<P>This plainly appears to be a Poetical Piece; for the Author all along makes U&s;e of Allegorical Sayings, to &s;ignify the great Angui&s;h and Tri|bulation he had been under.</P>
<P>The Hatred of his Enemies was the fiercer, becau&s;e he had undi&s;|gui&s;edly and clearly demon&s;trated their Duty to the Rulers and Preach|ers, and Lawyers: For in a certain Book publi&s;hed by him in the Year 1653, to exhort Men to Repentance, he writes thus to the Rulers:</P>
<Q><P>O You Rulers of the People, who are &s;et up to judge between a Man and his Neighbour, ought not you to judge for God, and not for Man? Ought not you to be Men fearing God, and hating Covetou&s;ne&s;s, not judging for Gifts and Re|wards? Ought not you to countenance and encourage them that do well, and be
<PB N="146" REF="003104_0157_0FEFF4BA9E593DC8">
a Terror to them which do Evil? Ju&s;tice is &s;o. And he that is of God, and bears his Sword, turns the Edge of it again&s;t all Sin and Wickedne&s;s, Inju&s;tice and Oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;o &s;ets up Ju&s;itce and Judgment in the Gates, that the Poor may be deliver'd from him that is too mighty for him, and that the Cau&s;e of the Fatherle&s;s, Widow and Stranger may not fall; but hath an Ear open to the Cries of the Poor and Helple&s;s, who hath but little Money, and few Friends; that a poor Man may not be afraid to appear in a good Cau&s;e, again&s;t the great|e&s;t Oppre&s;&s;or in the Nation.</P>
<P>And ought not you to judge without Re&s;pect to Per&s;ons, or without &s;eeking Re&s;|pect to your own Per&s;ons, Wor&s;hip or Honour from Men, but only to advance Ju|&s;tice, Equity, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of God, that &s;o you may be honour'd by the Lord? for true Humility is Honour, and he that honours the Lord, him will he honour; and &s;uch hath been honour'd in all Ages, tho' they never &s;ought it from Men.</P></Q>
<P>This and much more he wrote to the Rulers. And to the Preachers thus:
<Q>And you who &s;ay, you are the Teachers of the Nation, How long will it be ere you look at your own Ways? Is not all Manner of Filthine&s;s a|mong&s;t you, which you &s;hould lead the People out of? Is there not among you Drunkenne&s;s, Gluttony, Whoredom, and Sporting, Sitting down to eat and to drink, and ri&s;ing up to play; Swearing, Lying, Backbiting, fal&s;e Accu&s;ing, Railing, Slandering, Contention, Strife and Envy? Yea, are not the be&s;t of you given to Pride and Covetou&s;ne&s;s, which is Idolatry, Fulne&s;s of Bread, and Abundance of Idlene&s;s? Are not you Hirelings, and teach for the Fleece? Do not you contend for Money with your own Hearers, and &s;ue them at Law for it; yea, altho' they cannot &s;atisfy your Demand, without &s;inning again&s;t the Light in their own Con&s;cience, and &s;o &s;in again&s;t God? Are you not bitter, and Per&s;ecutors of any that come to di&s;cover your Lewdne&s;s, crying out to the Magi&s;trate to uphold you in your bea&s;tly Ways, and to &s;top the Mouths of all tho&s;e whom God hath &s;ent to witne&s;s again&s;t you? And many more Works of this Nature are among you, which the pure All-&s;eeing God hath &s;hewed unto his People to be among&s;t you; and therefore it is that they come out from you, le&s;t they partake with you of your Sins and Plagues.

<P>The Lawyers in the &s;ame Writing had a Stroke al&s;o, thus:
<Q>And you Lawyers, ought not you to plead the Cau&s;e of Equity between Man and Man for Equity Sake, without Re&s;pect to your &s;elves or others, but only to Truth it &s;elf, that a ju&s;t Cau&s;e may be owned in whom&s;oever it concerns? But is not the ju&s;te&s;t Cau&s;e &s;ure to fall, if the Party have not Money to &s;atisfy your De|mands, which are many Times very unrea&s;onable? And you who &s;hould in&s;truct People in the Ways of Truth and Peace, do not you by your Wi&s;dom teach them Lies and Strife? Do not you advi&s;e your Plantiffs, as you call them, to declare in Bills, Things that are not true, and make &s;mall Offences &s;eem very great by fal&s;e Glo&s;&s;es? For &s;ay you, <HI>We may declare what we will, and prove what we can;</HI> &s;o that you, and they whom you act for, know before hand, that &s;carce one Thing of Ten can be proved, neither is true? Is this the Way to <HI>make up the Breach, and pre&s;erve Peace and Truth among People?</HI> O mi&s;erable Fall from God, when that Law which &s;hould before pre|&s;erve in Peace, is u&s;ed to aggravate Offences beyond Truth, and &s;o make Differences greater.

the greater Di&s;&s;ention among&s;t the People, the more is your Gain? Are not your Pur&s;es filled, and your E&s;tates rai&s;ed in the Ruins of the People? And are not tho&s;e Laws which ought to be u&s;ed to pre&s;erve People from Oppre&s;&s;ion, by abu&s;ing, made the &V;ndoing of whole Families, impoveri&s;hing Towns and Countries?

Tho&s;e whom he hath redeemed, he hath freed from the Servitude of Sin, by &s;eparating them from Sin, and recon|ciling them to God, from whence they are fallen by Sin; for God and Sin cannot dwell in one.

<P>Thus <HI>J. Naylor</HI> wrote: But I now break off, that I may not be te|dious.</P>
<P>So zealous was he before his Fall, which was wholly of another Nature than the common Sins and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions: For by the Wiles of Satan he accepted the idolatrous Honour that &s;ome Per&s;ons gave him, in&s;tead of which he ought to have reproved them: And thus was he &s;o &s;tupified in his Under&s;tanding, that he imagin'd the Bow|ing and kneeling before him, was not done on Account of his Per&s;on, but for Chri&s;t: And with this fal&s;e Opinion he blinded him&s;elf for a Time, till it pleas'd God to pity him, and to give him Light again, after he had &s;uffer'd &s;uch an unheard of Puni&s;hment for his Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, as is already related in this Hi&s;tory. And becau&s;e his Free|dom of Speech again&s;t Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of all Sorts, and his Preach|ing ran very &s;harp upon all, &s;everal were angry with him, became his Enemies, and took Occa&s;ion from his Crime to revenge them&s;elves fiercely upon him, by making him &s;uffer a cruel Puni&s;hment, which was no Ways proportionable to his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. But herein barba|rous Cruelty plaid its Part &s;o much, that the &s;obere&s;t Inhabitants did dete&s;t it, and therefore a Petition was pre&s;ented to the Parliament, de|&s;iring a Di&s;charge of Part of the Puni&s;hment, of which, the fir&s;t Sub&s;criber was Colonel <HI>Scroop,</HI> who was Governor of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></P>
<P>While he lay in the Hou&s;e of Correction, he wrote &s;everal Papers to manife&s;t his Regret and Repentance for his Crime; &s;ome of which are already in&s;erted in this Hi&s;tory. Since is come to my Hand a Letter to his Friends, being written with his own Hand, to this Purport:</P>

<P>I &s;ay then, what is become of your &s;piritual Weapons? Have not your Teachers told People of the Strength of Truth, and the Pow|er of Godline&s;s?

Surely it may be &s;aid, you have been bad Watchmen, and idle Shepherds, who have lo&s;t all, if &s;udden Help come not from another Hand. Now if any had come again&s;t you with carnal Weapons, then had you had &s;ome Excu&s;e in crying to the Earthly Powers; but in that, nothing but Spirit comes again&s;t Spirit, and yet you have lo&s;t the Day.

who pur&s;ued my Soul unto Death (as much as in them lay) in that Day of my Calamity, when my Adver&s;ary was above, and wherein I was made a Sign to a back&s;liding Generation, who then would not &s;ee nor hear what now is com|ing upon them, but rejoiced again&s;t this Piece of Du&s;t, and had little Pity to|wards him that was fallen into their Hands; wherein God was ju&s;t in giving me up for my Di&s;obedience, for a little Moment, as a Father to correct; yet &s;hould not they have &s;ought to aggravate Things again&s;t me, as thou do&s;t; for it was a Day of deep Di&s;tre&s;s, and lay &s;ore upon my Soul, and the merciful God &s;aw it, who, tho' he was di&s;plea&s;ed for a Time, yet his Thoughts were not to ca&s;t off for ever <HI>(but extend Mercy)</HI> as it is at this Day, Glory be to his Name, from my delivered Soul, eternally.</P>
<P>And in that Day there were many Spirits flock'd about me, and &s;ome whom, while the Candle of the Lord &s;hone upon my Head, I ever judged and kept out from me, who then got up and acted, and &s;poke &s;everal Things not in the Light and Truth of God, by which they, who &s;ought Occa&s;ion again&s;t me, were then &s;trengthened to afflict this Body; and he that watches for Evil, in thee and &s;ome others, makes &V;&s;e on &s;till again&s;t God's Truth and innocent People; who&s;e Mouths the God of my Mercy &s;top, and &s;o fini&s;h the Trouble of my Heart as to that Thing, for my Soul hath long dwelt among Lions, even among them that are &s;et on Fire, <HI>who&s;e Teeth are Spears and Arrows, and their Tongues a &s;harp Sword, &s;peaking mi&s;chievous Things to &s;hed Blood.</HI></P>
<P>But O Man, or Men, whoever you be, who&s;e Work it is to gather the Fail|ings of God's People in the Time of Temptation, or Night of their Trial, and aggravate them, and add thereto the Wickedne&s;s and mi&s;chievous Lies of your own Hearts, as thou ha&s;t done in thy Book, and then come out with tho&s;e again&s;t God's everla&s;ting holy Truth, it to reproach; I &s;ay, you are &s;et on work by an evil Spirit, and you do but &s;hew your &s;elves to be Enemies to God and his Children; and it is our Sorrow, that any of us &s;hould give &s;uch Spirits Occa&s;ion to bla&s;pheme; and it hath been Trouble of Soul to all the People of God, that have ever loved Righteou&s;ne&s;s, when they have thus occa&s;ioned the Joy of the Wicked, or to feed the Man that watches for Iniquity, and feeds on Mi&s;chief: Yet know this, you that are of that Brood, God will not ca&s;t off his People; tho' he be &s;ometimes provoked to correct them, even before their Adver&s;aries,(which is a Sign to them) yet is his Anger but for a Moment, and his Favour &s;hall <HI>return as Streams of Life;</HI> then &s;hall the <HI>Food be taken out of the Mouth of the Viper, and the Prey from between the Teeth of the Devourers;</HI> and God will feed them with their own Vomit, and the Poi&s;on that hath long lain under their Tongues, &s;hall be bitter in their own Bowels. Thus will God certainly <HI>plead with</HI> Zion<HI>'s Enemies, as he bends her Sons for him&s;elf, and God will make up her Breaches:</HI> And this hath my Soul &s;een, <HI>Jacob's Captivity re&s;tored, and the Diggers of the Pit are fal|len therein;</HI> neither hath he &s;mitten him as he &s;mote them that &s;mote him, nor is he &s;lain according to the Slaughter of them that are &s;lain by him; but this is all <HI>His Fruit to purge away his Sin.</HI></P>
<P>So he that had long watched for my faltering, then got Advantage again&s;t me; yet had I then Power to bear his utmo&s;t Envy, thro' <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us, whom I then confe&s;&s;ed before Men,</HI> who then was my Support in all, and under all, and who is over all, ble&s;&s;ed for ever of all who have proved him in the Depth.</P>
<P>But that which was, and is the Sorrow of my Heart, is the Advantage the Enemy then took again&s;t the Name of Chri&s;t, his Truth, and his de&s;pi&s;ed Peo|ple, in that Time of Temptation, which is that which thou art now pur&s;uing with Hatred and Lies, as <HI>That I was &s;u&s;pected to have a Woman in Bed with me, the Night before I &s;uffered at</HI> Bri&s;tol, when there were &s;ix or &s;even Per&s;ons in the Room that Night, and a Man (to wit) <HI>Robert Rich</HI> in Bed with me. But this, and &s;everal other fal&s;e things thou ha&s;t written in thy Book, of which I am clear before the Lord, &s;o they touch me not at all; nor &s;hall I here mention them again&s;t thee in particular; but to God alone I look, in his

Time to be cleared from all Offences in his Sight, who only knows my Heart in this Thing, in who&s;e Pre&s;ence I can &s;ay, that nothing is more odious and bur|den&s;ome to my Soul, than that any of the Glory or Wor&s;hip which belongs to God, or to Chri&s;t, &s;hould be given to Fle&s;h and Blood, in my &s;elf, or others: And how it was with me at that Day, many talk of, but few know; &s;o the Judg|ment of &s;uch I bear; de&s;iring that none in judging me, might have condemned them&s;elves in God's Sight, who&s;e <HI>Coun&s;els are a great Deep, and the End of his Work pa&s;t finding out,</HI> till he him&s;elf reveal them; but in the End he will be ju&s;tified of all, and in all he doth, that all Fle&s;h may be &s;ilent before him.</P>
<P>And however my &s;elf, or any others my be left to them&s;elves, to be tried in the Night, yea, &s;hould any utterly fall, or whatever may be acted by any Man or Woman, that is not ju&s;tifiable in God's Sight, yet in vain do&s;t thou, or you, gather up Sin, or watch for Iniquity, to ca&s;t upon the Light which condemns it in every enlighten'd Con&s;cience, and there will clear him&s;elf to be no Author nor Actor therein; and I know by the Spirit of Je&s;us, which I have received, and which worketh in me, that this is not his Work, nor his Seed, nor in him that loves his Enemies, thou art not; but the old <HI>Accu&s;er of the Brethren</HI> it is that worketh &s;trongly in thee; and in the Light which thou reproache&s;t, art thou &s;een to be <HI>the Man that makes Lies, and carries Tales to &s;hed Blood, Ezek. xxii. 9, 12.</HI></P>

<P>I as one that hath obtain'd Mercy from the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1657</NOTE> and unto whom his Word is committed, being moved of him, do hereby in his Pre|&s;ence, yet once more warn thee, that thou fear before him, and dili|gently hearken to him, and &s;eek him with all thy Heart, that thou may'&s;t know his Will and Coun&s;el concerning thee, and may'&s;t do it, and find Favour in his Sight, and live. Now is the Day that his Hand is &s;tretched forth unto thee, to make thee a Ble&s;&s;ing, or to leave thee a Cur&s;e for ever; and the Days of thy Vi&s;itation are near an End, when God will no more call unto thee, nor hear thee, when in the Day of thy Trouble thou call'&s;t to him.&mdash; And if thou rejecte&s;t the Coun&s;el of the Lord, and followe&s;t the De&s;ires of thine own Heart, and the Wills of Men, and wilt not have the Light of the World, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, only to rule thee, and to teach thee, which condemns all Evil, then &s;hall Evil &s;urely fall upon thee, if thou love&s;t not the Light in thee, which condemns it; and the Judgments of God, nor the Day of his la&s;t Vi&s;itation with Vengeance thou may'&s;t not e&s;cape. Therefore con&s;ider, and mark my Words, and let this Coun&s;el be ac|ceptable unto thee; let it move thee to Meekne&s;s, to Humblene&s;s, and to fear before the Lord, a&s;&s;uredly knowing that it is he that changeth Times and Things, and that bringeth down, and &s;etteth up whom&s;oever he will; and how that thou wa&s;t rai&s;ed from a low E&s;tate, and &s;et over all thine Enemies.&mdash; And in that Day when thou wa&s;t rai&s;ed up, when the Fear of the Lord was before thy Face, and thy Heart was towards him, and thou wa&s;t but little in thine own Eyes, then was it well with thee, and the Lord ble&s;&s;ed thee.&mdash; And it was not once thought concerning thee, that the Hands of the Ungodly would have been &s;trengthned again&s;t the Righteous under thee, or that &s;uch grievous and cruel Burdens and Oppre&s;&s;ions would ever have been laid upon the Ju&s;t, and acted again&s;t them in thy Name, and under thy Dominion, as unrighteou&s;ly have come to pa&s;s in the&s;e three Years: And this thy &s;uffering of &s;uch Things is thy Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and thou ha&s;t not requited the Lord well for his Goodne&s;s unto thee, nor ful|filled his Will in &s;uffering that to be done under thee, and in thy Name, which the Lord rai&s;ed thee again&s;t, and to break down, had&s;t thou been faithful to the End.</P>
<P>Again, con&s;ider, and let it move on thy Heart, not to exalt thy &s;elf, nor to be high-minded, but to fear continually, knowing that thou &s;tande&s;t not by thy &s;elf, but by another, and that he is able to aba&s;e thee, and give thee into the Will of thy Enemies when&s;oever he will; and how the Lord hath pre&s;erved thee &s;ometimes wonderfully, and doth unto this Day, from the murderous Plots, and crafty Policy of evil Men, who &s;eek thy Evil, and would rejoice in thy Fall, and in the De&s;olation of thy Family and Countries: How have they, and do they lay Snares for thy Feet, that thou may&s;t be cut off from among&s;t Men, and die unhappily, and be accounted accur&s;ed? And yet to this Day he hath pre&s;erved thee, and been near to keep thee, tho' thou ha&s;t hardly known it; and the Lord's End is Love to thee in all the&s;e Things, and yet a little longer to try thee, that thou may&s;t give him the Glory.</P>
<P>O that thy Heart were opened to &s;ee his Hand, that thou mighte&s;t live unto him, and die in him in Peace.

<P>con&s;ider what the Cau&s;e is, that what thou de&s;ire&s;t not to be done is yet done: Is it not that thou maye&s;t plea&s;e Men? Making it appear thou art more willing to do the fal&s;e Teachers of this Nation, and wicked Men, a Plea&s;ure, than to own the People of God in relieving them, and ea&s;ing them of their cru|el Burthens and Oppre&s;&s;ions laid upon them by unju&s;t Men. For a Word of thy Mouth, or a Shew of thy Countenance in Di&s;like of the&s;e cruel and unju&s;t Per&s;e|cutions, would bind the Hands of many blood-thir&s;ty Men. Therefore con&s;ider: Thou can&s;t not be cleared in the Sight of the Lord God from them, being acted under thee, and in thy Name: For there &s;eems rather to be a Favouring of them in thee, by Forbearance of the Actors of Cruelty, by which their Hands are &s;trength|ened, than any Di&s;like &s;hewed by thee, in bearing thy Witne&s;s, as thou oughte&s;t to do, again&s;t them.

<P>And as concerning the Light of Chri&s;t, at which thou &s;tumble&s;t, by which eve|ry Man that cometh into the World is enlightened, in &s;hort, this I &s;ay, This Light to thee is given of God, and thou mu&s;t own it to be thy only Teacher to receive by it from the Father, and to be guided by it in all Things, if ever thou inherite&s;t God's Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of Chri&s;t is &s;etting up by his own Power, and all mu&s;t bow and become &s;ubject thereunto; he needeth none of thy Policy, nor the Strength of thy Arm to advance it: yet would he have thee not to prove thy &s;elf an open Enemy thereof, by doing or &s;uffering to be done, Cruelty and Inju&s;tice again&s;t them whom the Lord is redeeming out of this World, into Subjection unto that Kingdom; le&s;t thou be &s;uch a one, as will not enter thy &s;elf, nor &s;uffer others to enter, and &s;o De&s;truction come upon thee.

Whil&s;t he was thus &s;itting with a retired Mind, the <HI>Turks</HI> began to fall out among them&s;elves, and whil&s;t they were at odds, a grave ancient <HI>Turk,</HI> a Man of Note, came to him, and &s;aid, <HI>whether he would turn from his Religion, or not, he &s;hould not die.</HI> Then he was brought before the Prie&s;ts again, who asked him, <HI>will you turn?</HI> And he an&s;wering, <HI>No,</HI> they recorded in a Book, <HI>That he was no</HI> Roman Catholick, <HI>but of ano|ther Religion;</HI> for having denied to be &s;uch a <HI>Catholick,</HI> yet he had own|ed that he was a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> being come now to be more &s;edate, the afore&s;aid ancient Man ordered his Servants to conduct <HI>Robin&s;on</HI> to his Hou&s;e, where he was friendly entertained, and &s;oon perceived that the Friars had thus plotted again&s;t him; for he went not into the Mo&s;que of his own Accord, being led into it; but Heaven pre&s;erved him. After having been four or five Days in the Hou&s;e of the ancient <HI>Turk,</HI> there came a Guard of Hor&s;e|men, hired by the Friars, to carry him to <HI>Gaza;</HI> for they had pre-in|form'd the Ba&s;ha of that Place again&s;t him: But <HI>Robin&s;on</HI> being come thither, Things took another Turn than they expected; for the Ba&s;ha being by &s;ome <HI>Turks</HI> made acquainted with the mi&s;chievous De&s;ign of the Friars, made them not only pay a con&s;iderable Fine, but command|ed them al&s;o to convey <HI>Robin&s;on</HI> &s;afely to <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Now whil&s;t he was at <HI>Gaza,</HI> he was vi&s;ited by many <HI>Turks, Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Armenians;</HI> the lat|ter of which having heard he was a Chri&s;tian, and that he cho&s;e rather to die than to turn from his Religion, became very loving to him, as were the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the <HI>Jews</HI> al&s;o &s;hewed them&s;elves moderate towards him.

<P>The next Morning there came a Friar to him, and asked, <HI>If he would become an obedient Child, and go to vi&s;it the holy Places, according to their Cu&s;tom?</HI> He an&s;wered, <HI>No.</HI> Then the Friar &s;aid, <HI>Whereas others give great Sums of Money to &s;ee them, you &s;hall &s;ee them for Nothing.</HI> But <HI>Ro|bin&s;on</HI> replyed, <HI>I &s;hall not vi&s;it them in your Manner, for in &s;o Doing I &s;hould &s;in again&s;t God.</HI> This did not plea&s;e the Friar, yet he &s;aid, <HI>They would honour him as much as ever they did any</HI> Engli&s;h-Man <HI>that came thither, if he would conform unto them.</HI> But <HI>Robin&s;on</HI> continued immoveable, and &s;aid, <HI>He &s;hould not conform; and as to their Honour, he did not matter it.</HI> Then the Friar became angry, and &s;aid, <HI>They would make him an Exam|ple

Then they brought him before a <HI>Turk</HI> in Authority in that Place, who asked him divers Que&s;tions, to which he &s;oberly gave An&s;wers; and they di&s;cour&s;ing about the Wor&s;hip of the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> the <HI>Turk</HI> asked al&s;o, <HI>What was the Ground of his coming to</HI> Jeru&s;alem? To which he an&s;wered, <HI>That it was by the Command of the Lord God of Heaven and Earth he came thither; and that the great and tender Love of God was made manife&s;t in vi&s;iting them; his compa&s;&s;ionate Mercies being &s;uch, that he would gather them in this the Day of his gathering.</HI> This was the Me&s;&s;age which <HI>Robin&s;on</HI> believed he had from the Lord to declare unto them, whether they would hear, or forbear. And afterwards he wrote, that having thus cleared his Con|&s;cience, he found great Peace with the Lord, and therefore he mag|nified his glorious Name, who had gone along with him, and pre&s;er|ved him in many Trials.

Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>as it now &s;tood, was not degenerated from the true Church which was in the primitive Times, from the Life and Do|ctrine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

Fox</HI> being come in, the Je&s;uit was asked, <HI>Whether they had the Holy Gho&s;t poured out upon them, as the Apo&s;tles had?</HI> And he &s;aid, <HI>No.</HI> Then &s;aid <HI>G. Fox, If ye have not the &s;ame Holy Gho&s;t poured forth upon you, and the &s;ame Power and Spirit, that the Apo&s;tles had, then ye are degene|rated from the Power and Spirit, which the Primitive Church was in.</HI> And he asked the Je&s;uit, <HI>What Scripture they had for &s;etting up Cloi&s;ters for Nuns, Abbies and Mona&s;teries for Men, and for their praying by Beads, and to Ima|ges, and for making Cro&s;&s;es, for forbidding of Meats and Marriages, and for putting People to Death for Religion?</HI> If, &s;aid he, <HI>ye are in the Practice of the Primitive Church, in its Purity and Virginity, then let us &s;ee by Scripture where-ever they practi&s;ed &s;uch Things?</HI> For it was agreed mutually, that both the <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> and the <HI>Quakers</HI> &s;hould make good by Scripture what they &s;aid. Then the <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> &s;aid, there was a <HI>written,</HI> and an <HI>unwritten Word.</HI> Which made <HI>G. Fox</HI> ask, <HI>What he called his unwritten Word?</HI> And he an&s;wer'd, <HI>The written Word is the Scriptures, and the unwritten Word is that which the Apo&s;tles &s;pake by Word of Mouth, which are all tho&s;e Traditions that we practi&s;e.</HI> Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> bid him <HI>prove that by Scripture;</HI> and the Je&s;uit alledged the Words of the Apo&s;tle, 2 <HI>The&s;&s;. ii.</HI> 5. <HI>When I was with you, I told you the&s;e Things: That is,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I told you of Nunneries and Mona&s;teries, of putting to Death for Religion, and of Praying by Beads and to Images,</HI> &amp;c. This he affirmed to be the <HI>unwritten Word</HI> of the Apo&s;tles, <HI>which they told then, and had &s;ince been continued by Tradition unto the&s;e Times.</HI> Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> de&s;ired him <HI>to read that Scripture again, that he might &s;ee how he had perverted the Apo&s;tle's Words, &s;ince that which the Apo&s;tle &s;aid there he had told them before, was not an unwritten Word, but was written down there;</HI> namely, <HI>that the Man of Sin, the Son of Perdition, &s;hould be re|vealed before that great and terrible Day of Chri&s;t, which he was writing of, &s;hould come. And therefore this was not telling them any of tho&s;e things the</HI> Church of Rome <HI>practi&s;ed. Be&s;ides, the Apo&s;tle, in the third Chapter of the &s;aid</HI> Epi&s;tle, <HI>told the Church of &s;ome di&s;orderly Per&s;ons he heard were among&s;t them, Bu&s;y-bodies, who did not work at all; concerning whom he had command|ded them</HI> by his unwritten Word, <HI>when he was among them, that if any would not work, neither &s;hould be eat; which now he commanded them again in his</HI> written Words in this Epi&s;tle, 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> iii.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uit now finding no other Scriptural Proof for the Tradition of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> let that Point fall, and came to the Sacrament of the Altar; to prove the Reality of which, he began with the <HI>Pa&s;|chal Lamb,</HI> and the <HI>Shew Bread,</HI> and &s;o came to the Words of Chri&s;t, <HI>This is my Body,</HI> and to what the Apo&s;tle writ to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> conclu|ding from thence, <HI>that after the Prie&s;t had con&s;ecrated the Bread and Wine, it was immortal and divine, and that he who received it, received the whole Chri&s;t.</HI> To this <HI>G. Fox</HI> &s;aid, <HI>that the &s;ame Apo&s;tle told the</HI> Corinthians, <HI>after they had taken Bread and Wine in Remembrance of Chri&s;t's Death,</HI> that they were Reprobates if Chri&s;t was not in them. <HI>But that if the Bread they eat was Chri&s;t, he mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity have been in them, after they had eaten it. Be&s;ides, if the Bread and Wine which the</HI> Corinthians <HI>ate and drunk, was Chri&s;t's Body, how then</HI> (continued he) <HI>hath Chri&s;t a Body in Heaven?</HI> And he al&s;o &s;ignified to him, <HI>that both the Di&s;ciples at the Supper, and the</HI> Corinthians <HI>afterwards, were to eat the Bread and drink the Wine</HI> in Remembrance of Chri&s;t, <HI>and</HI> to &s;hew forth his Death till he came; <HI>which plainly prov'd, that the Bread and Wine which they took, was not his Body. For if it had been his real Body that they ate,</HI> then he had been

come, and was then <HI>there pre&s;ent; and it would have been improper to have done &s;uch a thing in Remembrance of him, if he had been then pre&s;ent with them; as he mu&s;t have been, if that Bread and Wine, which they eat and drank, had been his real Body.</HI> And as to the Words of Chri&s;t; <HI>This is my Body,</HI> G. Fox told him, <HI>Chri&s;t calls him&s;elf a</HI> Vine, <HI>and a</HI> Door, <HI>and is called in Scripture, a</HI> Rock: <HI>Is Chri&s;t therefore an outward Rock, Door, or Vine? O,</HI> &s;aid the Je&s;uit, <HI>The&s;e Words are to be interpreted. So,</HI> &s;aid G. Fox, <HI>are tho&s;e Words of Chri&s;t, This is my Body.</HI> And having thus &s;topt the Je&s;uit's Mouth, he made this Propo&s;al; <HI>That &s;eeing he &s;aid the Bread and Wine was immortal and divine, and the very Chri&s;t, and that who&s;oever received it, received the whole Chri&s;t; a Meeting might be appointed between &s;ome &s;uch</HI> Pa|pi&s;ts <HI>as the</HI> Pope <HI>and his</HI> Cardinals <HI>&s;hould appoint, and &s;ome of tho&s;e called</HI> Quakers: <HI>And then,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>let a Bottle of Wine, and a Loaf of Bread he brought, and divided each into two Parts, and let them con&s;ecrate which of tho&s;e Parts they will; and then let the con&s;ecrated and uncon&s;ecrated Bread and Wine be &s;et in a &s;afe Place, with a &s;ure Watch upon it; and let Trial then be made, whether the con&s;ecrated Bread and Wine will not lo&s;e its Goodne&s;s,</HI> viz. <HI>the Bread grow dry and mouldy, and the Wine turn dead and &s;oure, as well and as &s;oon as that which was uncon&s;ecrated; for by this Means the Truth of this Matter may be made manife&s;t. And if the con&s;ecrated Bread and Wine change not, but retain their Savour and Goodne&s;s, this may be a Means to draw many to your Church. But if they change, decay, and lo&s;e their Goodne&s;s, then ought you to confe&s;s and for&s;ake your Error, and &s;hed no more Blood about it, as hath been done, e&s;pecially in Queen</HI> Mary's <HI>Days.</HI> To this, the Je&s;uit made this Reply; <HI>Take a Piece of new Cloth, and cut it into two Pieces, and make two Garments of it, and put one of them upon King</HI> David's <HI>Back, and the other upon a Beggar's, and the one Garment &s;hall wear away as well as the other. Is this,</HI> &s;aid G. Fox, <HI>thy An&s;wer? Yes,</HI> &s;aid the Je&s;uit. <HI>Then,</HI> &s;aid G. Fox, <HI>By this the Company may all be &s;atisfied, that your con&s;ecrated Bread and Wine is not Chri&s;t. Do&s;t thou now &s;ay that the con&s;ecrated Bread and Wine, which you have told People was immortal and divine, and the real Body and Blood of Chri&s;t, will wear away, or decay as well as the other? Then I mu&s;t tell thee, Chri&s;t remains the &s;ame to Day as Ye&s;terday, and never decays; but is the Saints Heavenly Food in all Generations, thro' which they have Life.</HI> To this the Je&s;uit reply'd no more, but let the Thing fall; for he perceived that tho&s;e which were pre&s;ent, &s;aw his Error, and that he could not defend it. Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> asked him, <HI>why the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>did per&s;ecute, and put People to Death for Religion?</HI> And he an&s;wered, <HI>It was not the Church did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but the Magi&s;trates. G. Fox</HI> asked, <HI>whether tho&s;e Magi&s;trates were not counted and called Believers and Chri&s;tians? Yes,</HI> &s;aid he. <HI>Are they not Mem|bers of your Church?</HI> asked <HI>G. Fox. Yes,</HI> &s;aid the Je&s;uit. Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> left it to the People to judge, <HI>whether the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>did not per&s;ecute, and put People to Death for Religion.</HI> And thus they parted; the Je&s;uit's Subtilty being comprehended by the Simplicity of <HI>G.

<P>BE, &s;till and cool in thy own Mind and Spirit from thy own Thoughts, and then thou wilt feel the Principle of God, to turn thy Mind to the Lord God, from whom Life comes; whereby thou may'&s;t receive his Strength and Power to allay all blu&s;tering Storms and Tempe&s;ts. That is it which works up into Patience, into Innocency, into Soberne&s;s, into Stilne&s;s, into Stayedne&s;s, into Quietne&s;s, up to God with his Power. Therefore mind, that is the Word of the Lord unto thee, that the Authority of God thou may'&s;t feel and thy Faith in that, to work down that which troubles thee: For that is it which keeps Peace, and brings up the Witne&s;s in thee, which hath been tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, to feel after God with his Power and Life, who is a God of Order and Peace. When thou art in the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Life of God in thy own particular, the Mind flies up in the Air, and the Creature is led into the Night, and Na|ture goes out of its Cour&s;e, and an old Garment goes on, and an uppermo&s;t Clothing, and thy Nature being led out of its Cour&s;e, it comes to be all on a Fire, in the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and that defaceth the Glory of the fir&s;t Body. Therefore be &s;till a while from thy own Thoughts, &s;earching, &s;eeking, De&s;ires, and Imaginations, and be &s;tayed in the Principle of God in thee, that it may rai&s;e thy Mind up to God, and &s;tay it upon God, and thou wilt find Strength from him, and find him to be a God at hand, a pre&s;ent Help in the Time of Trouble, and of Need. And thou being come to the Principle of God, which hath been tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, it will keep thee humble; and the Humble God will teach his Way, which is Peace, and &s;uch he doth exalt. Now as the Principle of God in thee hath been tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, come to it, that it may keep thy Mind down

low to the Lord God; and deny thy &s;elf, and from thy own Will, that is the earthly, thou mu&s;t be kept: Then thou wilt feel the Power of God, which will bring Nature into its Cour&s;e, and give thee to &s;ee the Glory of the fir&s;t Body. And there the Wi&s;dom of God will be received (which is Chri&s;t, by which all Things were made and created) to be thereby pre&s;erved and ordered to God's Glory. There thou wilt come to receive and feel the Phy|&s;ician of Value, who clothes People in their right Mind; whereby they may &s;erve God, and do his Will. For all Di&s;tractions, Un|ruline&s;s, and Confu&s;ion is in the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; which Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be brought down, before the Principle of God, which hath been tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t, be lifted up; whereby the Mind may be &s;ea&s;on|ed and &s;tilled, and a right Under&s;tanding of the Lord may be recei|ved; whereby his Ble&s;&s;ings enter, and are felt, over all that is con|trary, in the Power of the Lord God, which rai&s;eth up the Principle of God within, and gives a Feeling after God, and in Time gives Dominion. Therefore keep in the Fear of the Lord God; that is the Word of the Lord God unto thee; for all the&s;e Things happen to thee for thy Good, and for the Good of tho&s;e concerned for thee, to make you know your &s;elves, and your own Weakne&s;s, and that ye may know the Lord's Strength and Power, and may tru&s;t in him. Therefore let the Time that is pa&s;t be &s;ufficient to every one, who in any Thing hath been lifted up in Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, out of the Pow|er of the Lord: For he can bring down, and aba&s;e the mighty, and lay them in the Du&s;t of the Earth. Therefore all keep low in his Fear, that thereby ye may receive the Secrets of God and his Wi&s;dom, and may know the Shadow of the Almighty, and &s;it under it in all Tempe&s;ts, Storms, and Heats. For God is a God at Hand, and the Mo&s;t-High rules in the Children of Men. So then this is the Word of the Lord God unto you all, what the Light doth make manife&s;t and di&s;cover, as Temptations, Di&s;tractions, Con|fu&s;ions; do not look at the Temptation, Confu&s;ions, Corruptions, but at the Light which di&s;covers them, and makes them manife&s;t. And with the &s;ame Light you may feel over them, to receive Pow|er to &s;tand again&s;t them. The &s;ame Light which lets you &s;ee Sin and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, will let you &s;ee the Covenant of God, which blots out your Sin and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, which gives Victory and Dominion over it, and brings into Covenant with God. For looking down at Sin, and Corruption and Di&s;traction, ye are &s;wallowed up in it: But looking at the Light which di&s;covers them, ye will &s;ee over them: That will give Victory, and ye will find Grace and Strength; and there is the fir&s;t Step to Peace.

To the Light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us in your Con&s;ciences do I &s;peak, which te&s;tifieth for God every Day, and witne&s;&s;eth again&s;t all Sin and Per&s;ecution; which Mea&s;ure of God, if ye be guided by it, doth not limit God to a Day, but leads to the Fa&s;t which the Lord requires, which is, <HI>To loo&s;e the Bonds of Wickedne&s;s, to undo the heavy Burdens, to break every Yoke, and to let the Oppre&s;&s;ed go free,</HI> I&s;a. lviii. 6, 7. This is the Fa&s;t the Lord requires; and this &s;tands not in the Tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Times, nor in the Traditions of Men: But this &s;tands in that which was before Times were, and which leads out of Time, and &s;hall be, when Time &s;hall be no more. And the&s;e that teach for Doctrine the Commandments of Men, are they that ever per&s;ecuted the Life and Power when it came. And where|as ye mention a Decree or Edict, that was made again&s;t the &s;aid per&s;ecuted Prote&s;tants; all &s;uch Decrees or Edicts proceed from the Ground of the Pope's Religion and Supremacy, and therein &s;tands his Tyranny and Cruelty, acted in that Will, which is in that Na|ture, which exerci&s;eth Lord&s;hip over one another, (as you may read, <HI>Mark</HI> x. 42. <HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 25.) as all the Heathen do, and ever did; and in the Heatheni&s;h Nature is all the Tyranny and Per&s;ecution ex|erci&s;ed, by them that are out of the Obedience to the Light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us in the Con&s;cience, which is the Guider and Leader of all who are tender of that of God in the Con&s;cience. But who are not led by this, know not what it is to &s;uffer for Con&s;cience &s;ake. Now, whereas ye take into your Con&s;ideration the &s;ad Per&s;ecution, Tyranny, and Cruelty exerci&s;ed upon them, whom ye call your Prote&s;tant Brethren, and do contribute and admini&s;ter to their Wants outwardly; this is good in its Place, and we own it, and &s;ee it good to admini&s;ter to the Nece&s;&s;ities of others, and to do good to all: And we who are Sufferers by a Law derived from the Pope, are willing to join, and to contribute with you to their outward <HI>Nece&s;&s;ities. For the Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulne&s;s thereof;</HI> who is good to all and gra|cious to all, and willing that all &s;hould be &s;aved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth. But in the mean Time, while ye are doing this, and taking Notice of others Cruelty, Tyranny, and Per&s;ecution, turn your Eye upon your &s;elves, and &s;ee what ye are doing at home. To the Light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us in all your Con&s;ciences I &s;peak, which cannot lie, nor cannot err, nor cannot bear fal&s;e witne&s;s; but doth bear Witne&s;s for God, and cries for Equity, and Ju&s;tice, and Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="179" REF="003104_0190_0FEFF4A30D8F7750">
to be executed. See what ye are doing who profe&s;s the Scriptures which were given forth by the Saints in Light, who dwelt in the Light and in the Life of them. For them who do now witne&s;s the &s;ame Light, the &s;ame Life, and the &s;ame Power which gave forth the Scriptures, which ye in Words profe&s;s, them ye per&s;ecute, them ye hale out of your Synagogues and Markets; them ye beat, &s;tock, and impri&s;on. Now let that of God in your Con&s;ciences, which is ju&s;t and righteous, and equal, examine and try, whether ye have any Example or Precedent to exerci&s;e this Per|&s;ecution, which now many in this Nation &s;uffer under, who are a People harmle&s;s and innocent, walking in Obedience towards God and Man: And tho' ye account the Way of Truth they walk in, Here&s;y; yet therein do they exerci&s;e them&s;elves to have always a <HI>Con&s;cience void of Offence towards God and Man,</HI> as ye may read the Saints of old did, <HI>Acts</HI> xxiv. 14, 15, 16. not wronging any Man, neither giving any ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Offence; only being obedient to the Commands of the Lord, to declare, as they are moved by the Holy Gho&s;t; and &s;tanding for the Te&s;timony of a good Con&s;cience, &s;peak|ing the Truth in Chri&s;t, their Con&s;ciences bearing them witne&s;s that they lie not: For this do they &s;uffer under you, who in Words profe&s;s the &s;ame Thing for which they &s;uffer. Now &s;ee if any Age or Ge|neration did ever per&s;ecute as ye do: For ye profe&s;s Chri&s;t Je&s;us who reveals the Father, and per&s;ecute them that witne&s;s the Revelati|on of the Father by Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto them. Ye profe&s;s Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who is the Light of the World, <HI>that enlightens every one that cometh into the World,</HI> and yet per&s;ecute them that bear witne&s;s and give Te&s;timony to this Light. Ye profe&s;s that the Word is become Fle&s;h, and yet per|&s;ecute them that witne&s;s it &s;o. Ye profe&s;s that who&s;oever confe&s;&s;eth not that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h, is an Antichri&s;t, and yet per&s;ecute them that do confe&s;s him come in the Fle&s;h, and call them Antichri&s;ts and Deceivers. Ye profe&s;s that the Kingdom of Chri&s;t is come, and yet per&s;ecute them that witne&s;s it come. Ye profe&s;s Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Re&s;urrection and the Life, and yet per&s;ecute them that wit|ne&s;s him to be &s;o. If ye &s;ay, <HI>How &s;hall we know that the&s;e People who &s;ay they witne&s;s the&s;e Things, do &s;o, or no?</HI> I an&s;wer, Turn your Minds to the Light which Chri&s;t Je&s;us hath enlightned you withal, which is one in all; and if ye walk in the Light, ye &s;hall have the Light of Life, and then ye will know and &s;ee what ye have done, who have per&s;ecuted the Lord of Glory (in his People) in whom is Life, and the Life is the Light of Men. To no other Touch&s;tone &s;hall we turn you, but into your own Con&s;ciences, and there &s;hall ye find the Truth of what we have declared unto you, and of what we bear Te&s;timony to, according to the Holy Scriptures. And when the Books of Con&s;ciences are opened, and all judged out of them, then &s;hall ye witne&s;s us to be of God, and our Te&s;timony to be true; tho' now ye may &s;top your Ears, and harden your Hearts, while it is called to Day: But then ye &s;hall know what ye have done, and whom ye have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t; and then ye will &s;ee that no Per&s;ecutors in any Age or Generation that ever went before you, did ever tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t that Light and Mea&s;ure of God made manife&s;t, in &s;uch Manner as ye have done. For tho' Chri&s;t and the Apo&s;tles were per&s;ecuted in their Times, the <HI>Jews,</HI> for the mo&s;t Part of them, did not know that he was the Chri&s;t, when he came, notwith&s;tanding that they had the Scriptures, which prophe|&s;ied of him; neither did they believe that he was ri&s;en again, when the Apo&s;tles preached his Re&s;urrection. But ye &s;ay, <HI>Ye believe he is come;</HI> and ye &s;ay, <HI>Ye believe his Re&s;urrection,</HI> and yet ye per&s;ecute
<PB N="180" REF="003104_0191_0FEFF4E7441F86D8">
tho&s;e that witne&s;s him come in the Fle&s;h, tho&s;e that are buried with him in Bapti&s;m, tho&s;e that are conformable to his Death, and know the Power of his Re&s;urrection, tho&s;e ye per&s;ecute, tho&s;e ye hale before Magi&s;trates, and &s;uffer to be beaten in your Synagogues; tho&s;e ye cau&s;e to be whipp'd and &s;tock'd, and &s;hamefully entreated, and into Pri&s;on ca&s;t, and kept, as many Jails in this Nation at this Day te&s;tify to your Faces. Therefore hone&s;tly con&s;ider what ye are doing, while ye are taking Notice of others Cruelties, le&s;t ye over-look your own. There is &s;ome Difference in many Things be|tween the Popi&s;h Religion, and that which ye call the Prote&s;tant; but in this Per&s;ecution of yours there is no Difference: For ye will confe&s;s, that the Foundation of your Religion is grounded upon the Scriptures; and yet now ye are per&s;ecuting them that be in the &s;ame Life which they were in who &s;pake forth the Scriptures; your &s;elves being the mean while under a Profe&s;&s;ion of the Words they &s;pake; and this ye &s;hall one Day witne&s;s. So ye have a Profe&s;&s;ion and Form, and per&s;ecute them that are in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, Life, and Power. There|fore know a&s;&s;uredly, that ye mu&s;t come to Judgment; for he is made manife&s;t to whom all Judgment is committed. Therefore to the Light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us in your Con&s;ciences, which &s;earcheth and tri|eth you, turn your Minds, and &s;tand &s;till, and wait there to receive the righteous Law, which is according to that of God in the Con&s;cience which is now ri&s;ing, and is bearing witne&s;s again&s;t all Ungodline&s;s and Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of Men; and they whom ye per&s;ecute, are manife&s;t to God, and that of God in all Con&s;ciences &s;hall bear Witne&s;s for us, that we are of God: And this ye &s;hall one Day witne&s;s, whe|ther ye will hear, or forbear. Our Rejoicing is in the Te&s;timony of our Con&s;ciences, that in Simplicity, and godly Sincerity, (not with fle&s;hly Wi&s;dom, but by the Grace of God) we have had our Conver|&s;ation in the World, not handling the Word of God deceitfully, but in the Manife&s;tation of the Truth; commending our &s;elves to every Man's Con&s;cience in the Sight of God: And if our Go&s;pel be hid, it is hid to them that are lo&s;t: And for the witne&s;&s;ing the holding the My&s;tery of Faith in a pure Con&s;cience, do we &s;uffer, and are &s;ub|ject for Con&s;cience-Sake. This is thank-worthy, if a Man for Con&s;cience-&s;ake endure Griefs and &s;uffering wrongfully. And in this is our Joy and Rejoicing, having a good Con&s;cience, that whereas we are evil &s;poken of, as Evil-doers, they may be a&s;hamed, that fal&s;ely accu&s;e our good Conver&s;ation in Chri&s;t; which is not only the putting a|way of the Filth of the Fle&s;h, but the An&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience towards God, by the Re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And this we wit|ne&s;s made manife&s;t, (eternal Prai&s;es to the living God) and bear Te|&s;timony to that which &s;pake it in the Apo&s;tle in Life and Power. And therefore do we bear witne&s;s, and te&s;tify again&s;t tho&s;e, who being got into a Form and Profe&s;&s;ion of it, do per&s;ecute the Life and Power. Therefore to the eternal Light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Searcher and Trier of all Hearts, turn your Minds, and &s;ee what ye are doing, le&s;t ye overturn your Foundation and Bottom whereon ye pretend to &s;tand, while ye are profe&s;&s;ing the Scriptures, and per&s;ecuting the Life, Light, and Power which they were in who gave them forth. For the Stone cut out of the Mountain without Hands, is now &s;tri|king at the Feet of the Image, the Profe&s;&s;ion which is &s;et up, and &s;tands in the Will of Man. Now is that made manife&s;t unto which all mu&s;t an&s;wer, and appear before the Judgment-Seat of Chri&s;t; that every one may receive the Thing done in his Body, accor|ding to that he hath done, whether it be good, or bad.

<P>REmember,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. Burrough</HI>'s Let|ter to <HI>Crom|well</HI>'s Wife and <HI>Children.</HI></NOTE> that by the Lord you were rai&s;ed from a low State, and when he will, he can aba&s;e you, and bring you down; he gave you the Palace of Princes, and threw out them before you.</P>
<P>O! remember this, every one of you, and come to the Witne&s;s of God in you, and be humble, and meek, and lowly, and let the Lord's Fear be in your Hearts, and be of a tender Spirit, having your Minds exerci&s;ed in Purity, in Holine&s;s, and in Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and exalt not your &s;elves, nor be lifted up in your Hearts, in the Pride and Vain|glories, and Honours of this World, le&s;t the Lord ca&s;t you down, and make your Name and Po&s;terity a Reproach, as he hath done many be|fore you; and if you walk in the &s;ame Steps, and do the &s;ame Things, and become guilty of the &s;ame Abominations, and &s;uffer the Chil|dren and Servants of the Lord to be per&s;ecuted (as many are at this Day, &s;ome until Death) &s;hall the Lord &s;pare you? Nay, he will cau&s;e you to feel his Hand of Judgment, and bring you down with Sor|row, and he will vex you in his Wrath, and &s;mite you with his Rod more and more, till you learn his Fear, and depart from all your Iniquities; and the Lord will deface your Glory, and pull down your Crown; and he will make you know, that he is Lord, that doth what&s;oever he will.</P>
<P>Wherefore humble your &s;elves under the Hand of God, and &s;earch your own Hearts, and ca&s;t out the Abominations that vex the Spirit of the Lord; and &s;uffer not the People of the Lord's precious Flock to be devour'd, and made a Prey to the Wicked; for becau&s;e of this, the Rod of Affliction cometh upon you, and may &s;uddenly break you to Pieces: But mind the Seed of God, in you, which is oppre&s;&s;ed, and wait to know the Power of the Lord, which will re|deem you out of Sin and Death, and reconcile you to God, and bring you into Fellow&s;hip with him&s;elf, to enjoy Peace and Re&s;t for your Souls, that you may be made Heirs of the Inheritance of an endle&s;s Life; and this would make you truly honourable, and will be more Satisfaction to you, and Joy, and Content, and true Rejoicing, than all worldly Crowns and Worldly Glories, which will wa&s;te and con&s;ume away, and leave you mi&s;erable: And remember that you are now warned from the Lord God, by whom I am moved to write this unto you, in dear and tender Love to you all; and one Day you &s;hall witne&s;s it.</P>
<P>And as concerning the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, who are accounted as vile in the Sight of Men, and are ca&s;t out of all Power and Place in the Nation, being de&s;pi&s;ed of all, and al&s;o are reproached, per&s;ecuted, and impri&s;oned, and all Manner of Evil and Inju&s;tice unrighteou&s;ly done, and &s;poken again&s;t them, by wicked and corrupt Men in Authority; yet are they the Children and Servants of the living God, and greatly beloved of him, and are as dear to him as the Apple of his Eye, and his Power and Pre&s;ence is with them; and the Time is at Hand, that the Lord will make their Per&s;ecutors fall, and their Enemies bow and tremble, tho' now they &s;uffer unju&s;tly, and are trodden down, as not de&s;erving a Place on the Earth; yet it is for Righteou&s;ne&s;s-&s;ake, and becau&s;e they &s;hew forth the Image of the Father, and not for Evil-doing: And will not their Sufferings lie upon you? For many Hun|dreds have &s;uffered cruel, and great Things, and &s;ome the Lo&s;s of Life (tho' not by, yet in the Name of the Protector;) and about an Hundred at this pre&s;ent Day lie in Holes, and Dungeons, and Pri&s;ons, up and down the Nation; and &s;ome at this Time are &s;ick nigh un|to

to Death, who&s;e Sufferings cry for Vengeance, and the Lord heareth the Cry: <HI>Wherefore &s;ave your &s;elves, and let the Innocent be delivered, and the cruel Bonds of Oppre&s;&s;ion broken, and the Exerci&s;e of a pure Con&s;cience go free, without Per&s;ecution; and then the Lord will turn away his Anger, and cea&s;e to &s;mite you with his Rod, which hath been upon you; and he will give you Peace, and make you ble&s;&s;ed, if you come to be led by his Spirit into all Truth.</HI> And tho' the&s;e innocent Lambs of Chri&s;t &s;uffer thus under this pre&s;ent Power, yet are they not Enemies to you, but are Friends to your Per&s;ons and Families, and pity you, and love you, and de&s;ire well for you in the Lord, that you may repent, and be healed, and even that your Hearts may be opened, to receive Refre&s;hments to your Souls, and that you may be e&s;tabli&s;hed in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Truth over all your Enemies, and may not be confounded, nor your Po&s;terity brought into Reproach, which is ha&s;tening upon you: And tho' our Love be de&s;pi&s;ed, and we accounted hateful in your Sight, and looked upon with Deri&s;ion, yet we bear all Things in Patience, truly de&s;iring your Returning and Repentance, and not your De&s;truc|tion: <HI>But if the&s;e doleful Sufferings of the Lord's poor Lambs be continued by this pre&s;ent Power, it will de&s;troy you, and undo you, and break you, and confound you; and the Lord will not cea&s;e to &s;mite you with his Rod of &s;harp Rebukes; and he will make you know, his People's Cau&s;e &s;hall not be unpu|ni&s;hed.</HI> Oh, did you but know how Hundreds have, and do &s;uffer!

Oh, did but your Eyes behold, or your Hearts perceive the Greatne&s;s of the Cruelty, which &s;ome of the Lord's dear Servants, and your faithful Friends undergo, it would make your Hearts ake, and your Spirits to tremble! And all this is done in the Name, and under the Authority of (Protector;) therefore how &s;hould the Lord but lay it to your Charge, and af|flict him and his Family? <HI>He will make you know there is a God that can do what&s;oever he will, and that Life and Death are in his Hands, and all Creatures are as Clay in the Hands of the Potter; and he rules in the Kingdoms of Men, and putteth down one, and &s;etteth up another, according to his Plea&s;ure:</HI> But if the Love of God be withholden from you, it is becau&s;e of Di&s;obedience to him, and your Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Wherefore be obedient to him, and love his Ways and Judgments, that he may make you more happy with a Crown immortal, that never fades away. And remember once more the Lord hath war|ned you, by a Friend unto you in the Lord.</P>

<P><HI>Cromwel</HI> was &s;natch'd away by Death at unawares; however the Day before his Decea&s;e, this Letter was delivered to his Relations.

His dying Day was remarkable by a mo&s;t grievous Tempe&s;t, not only in <HI>England,</HI> but al&s;o in the low Countries, where Trees were torn out of the Ground by the Violence of the Wind, and many Ships foundered. <Q>He was, &s;aith <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> one of tho&s;e Per&s;ons whom even his Enemies could not vilify,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s Saying of <HI>Crom|wel.</HI></NOTE> without prai&s;ing him.</Q> And I have heard impartial Men &s;ay, that in the Beginning of his Atchievements, he was an excel|lent Man; but being come to a high Station, he &s;oon lo&s;t that Zeal for the publick Welfare, by which at fir&s;t he &s;eem'd to be animated.</P>
<P>The Body of the Decea&s;ed was laid in <HI>Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e,</HI> in an A|partment enlightned only with Wax Tapers, the Corps being richly adorn'd.</P>
<P>After his Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His elde&s;t Son <HI>Richard</HI> pro|claimed.</NOTE> <HI>Richard,</HI> elde&s;t Son to <HI>Oliver,</HI> was proclaimed Pro|tector of the Common-wealth; to whom <HI>E.

<P><HI>As for Magi&s;tracy, it was ordained of God to be a Dread, and Terror, and Limit to Evil-doers, and to be a Defence and Prai&s;e to all that do well; to condemn the guilty, and to ju&s;tify the guiltle&s;s; but the Exerci&s;e thereof at this Day in the&s;e Nations is degenerated, and &s;ome that are in Authority are greatly corrupted, and regard not the ju&s;t and pure Law of God, to judge only thereby; but oppre&s;s the Poor by Inju&s;tice, and &s;ubvert the good Laws of God and Men to a wrong End and &V;&s;e, abu&s;ing Authority, and turning the Sword again&s;t the Ju&s;t, whereby true Judgment is turned backward, and the Innocent made unju&s;tly to &s;uffer for Righteou&s;ne&s;s-&s;ake, thro' the Corruption of Men in Authority; and did&s;t thou but know what we know in this Particular, it would pierce thy Heart: Why? It is frequent among &s;ome of the Judges and Magi|&s;trates,</HI> to commit a Man to Pri&s;on, and impo&s;e &s;ome great Fine upon him, and to ca&s;t him into a Dungeon, or Hole, among Thieves and Murderers, for a long Sea&s;on, for no other Offence, or Breach of any Law, but becau&s;e he cannot put off his Hat to them, and re&s;pect their Per&s;ons, by the Hat, or bowing the Knee: <HI>And many others that fear God, and for Con&s;cience-&s;ake cannot &s;wear upon a Book by ki&s;&s;ing it, and laying Hand upon it, becau&s;e Chri&s;t &s;aith,</HI> Swear not at all; <HI>tho' they deny not to &s;peak and do the Truth in all Things, as in the Pre&s;ence of God and all Men: And many others, that becau&s;e they are moved to cry again&s;t Sin, and de|clare again&s;t the Iniquities of the Times in Teachers, Rulers and People, that highly abound, perhaps in a Market, or Steeple-hou&s;e, or Highway, or other Places, as they are moved of God: And many others, becau&s;e for Con&s;cience-&s;ake they cannot pay Tythes, nor give Money and Wages to maintain a Prie&s;t, or fal&s;e Teacher, that they receive no Profit by: or to maintain a Steeple-hou&s;e, where the World wor&s;hips in vain Traditions, and not in the Spirit and Power of God. And many have been taken out of peaceable Meetings, where they were waiting upon the Lord; and &s;ome out of their Inns and Friend's Hou&s;es; and many have been taken on the Way, travelling about their lawful Occa&s;ions; and &s;ome from their Callings and Labours; and for the&s;e Cau&s;es, thro' the Envy of wicked Men, and without any ju&s;t Conviction of the Breach of any Law, or any lawful Trial or Examination, have Hundreds of ju&s;t Men, being wholly innocent, been &s;ent to Pri&s;on, and lain many Months, and &s;ome for Years, or whipt, or put in the Stocks, and grievou&s;ly abu&s;ed by cruel Executioners of wicked Mens Envy and Inju&s;tice; and upon &s;uch Grounds

only, and for &s;uch Cau&s;es mentioned, and without the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of any ju&s;t Law, have and do at this Day many Hundreds of faithful Sub|jects &s;uffer hard and cruel Things, long and &s;ore Impri&s;onment, and cruel and &s;harp Whipping, and Stocking, and unju&s;t Bani&s;hment out of Towns and Cities; yea, Friend, it's hard to be expre&s;&s;ed, and large to be declared, how many of the Lord's Servants do, and have &s;uffered great Inju&s;tice in the&s;e Nations, thro' the Abu&s;e of good Government, and Degeneration of Magi&s;tracy, from its per|fect State and Place, whereunto it was ordained of God in the Beginning.</HI></P>
<P>This Remon&s;tration, how powerful and large &s;oever, had not it due Effect; but Per&s;ecution continued, without being &s;topt by him&punc; For the Churchmen fawned upon him, calling him not only their <HI>Jo|&s;hua,</HI> but the Preachers of <HI>Suffolk</HI> &s;aid in their Addre&s;s to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Suffolk</HI> Prea|chers Addre&s;s to <HI>Richard.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Tho' our Sun is gone down, yet no Night en&s;ued.</HI></P>
<P>About this Time was given forth a Paper, called, <HI>The Church-Faith;</HI> and <HI>G. Fox</HI> having got a Copy of it before it was publi&s;hed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

This &s;o incen&s;ed &s;ome of the Parliament-men, that one of them told <HI>G. Fox, They mu&s;t have him to</HI> Smithfield. To which he an&s;wered, <HI>That he was over their Fires, and feared them not:</HI> And farther ask'd, <HI>Whether all People had been without a Faith the&s;e &s;ixteen Hundred Years, that now the Prie&s;t mu&s;t make them one? And &s;ince Chri&s;t Je|&s;us was the Author of the Apo&s;tle's Faith, and of the Church's Faith in the pri|mitive Times, and of the Martyrs Faith, &s;hould not all People look unto him to be the Author and Fini&s;her of their Faith, and not unto the Prie&s;ts?</HI> Nothing material was an&s;wered to this; for the Prie&s;ts called <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Friends, <HI>Hou&s;e-Creepers,</HI> becau&s;e they met together in Hou&s;es, and would not maintain the Prie&s;ts Temples. One Major <HI>Wiggan,</HI> that was pre&s;ent when <HI>G. Fox</HI> di&s;cour&s;ed with the Parliament-man, &s;aid, <HI>Chri&s;t had taken away the Guilt of Sin, but had left the Power of Sin remaining in us.</HI> But <HI>G.

<P>Now there was great Per&s;ecution, both by Impri&s;onment, and break|ing up of Meetings; and many died in Pri&s;ons: For the Prie&s;ts &s;peak|ing Evil of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> it did kindle the In&s;olency of the Rabble not a little, &s;o that they did not &s;tick to throw Squibs into the Meetings, to ca&s;t rotten Eggs on tho&s;e that were met, to beat on Drums and Kettles, and &s;o to make a hideous Noi&s;e, and to abu&s;e People mo&s;t grievou&s;ly with Blows and violent Pu&s;hes.</P>
<P>One Day there being a Meeting appointed near <HI>London,</HI> they beat and abu&s;ed about eighty Per&s;ons that came out of the City to meet there, tearing their Coats and Cloaks from off their Backs, and throw|ing them into Ditches and Ponds. The next Fir&s;t-day of the Week after this, <HI>G. Fox,</HI> tho' at that Time very weak, went thither,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

Ma|ny of his impri&s;oned Friends were now brought up to <HI>London</HI> to be tried by the Committee; where <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> being Chairman,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H.

But &s;ince many of them had been impri&s;oned upon <HI>Contempts,</HI> as the not putting off Hats before Magi&s;trates was called, others &s;ignified, that it mu&s;t not be expected that now they &s;hould comply; and &s;o thro' the Mediation of &s;ome that per&s;waded <HI>Vane,</HI> they were at length admitted; where they &s;o well defended their Cau&s;e, that &s;everal were &s;et at Liberty.</P>

And when <HI>Sarah</HI> afterwards ask'd the Governor <HI>John Endicot, Whether this was Ju&s;tice or Equity?</HI> adding, <HI>That by this all might &s;ee that God was with them, that they were pre&s;erved without Food; and if they peri&s;hed, their Blood would fall heavy on tho&s;e that were the Occa&s;ion thereof.</HI> He an&s;wer'd, <HI>That he matter'd it not.</HI></P>

<P>But when &s;hould I have done, if I would de&s;cribe all the Whippings inflicted on the <HI>Quakers</HI> &s;o called, in tho&s;e Parts!

<P>In the latter Part of the Fifth Month, it came to pa&s;s, that <HI>William Brend</HI> and <HI>William Leddra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Men have a Confe|rence with a Prie&s;t.</NOTE> having been at <HI>Salem,</HI> came to <HI>Newbury,</HI> where at the Hou&s;e of one <HI>Robert Adams</HI> they had a Conference with the

Prie&s;t, in the Pre&s;ence of Captain <HI>Geri&s;h,</HI> who had promi&s;ed that they &s;hould not &s;uffer: But after the Conference was ended, the Captain would not let them go, but on Promi&s;e pre&s;ently to depart the Town. Which being loth to comply with, as they were on their Way, they were &s;ent for back, and Captain <HI>Geri&s;h</HI> riding after them, commanded them to return; which they refu&s;ing, he compelled them thereunto, and &s;ent them with a Con&s;table to <HI>Salem;</HI> where being brought be|fore the Magi&s;trates, they were asked, <HI>Whether they were Quakers?</HI> To which they an&s;wered, <HI>That they were &s;uch that were in Scorn called &s;o.</HI> Next it was objected to them, <HI>That they maintained dangerous Errors.</HI> They asking what the&s;e were, it was told them, <HI>That they not only denyed that Chri&s;t at</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>had &s;uffered on the Cro&s;s, but al&s;o that they denied the Holy Scriptures.</HI> They boldly contradicted this, and &s;aid, <HI>They own|ed no other Je&s;us but he that had &s;uffered Death at</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>and that they al&s;o owned the Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>Now altho' nothing could be objected again&s;t this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And are &s;ent to the Hou&s;e of Correction, notwith&s;tan|ding Captain <HI>Geri&s;h</HI>'s Pro|mi&s;e to the contrary. Cruelly u&s;ed there.</NOTE> yet they were carried to the Hou&s;e of Correction, as &s;uch who, according to the Law made at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> might not come into tho&s;e Parts. Some Days after, they were carried to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> where, in the next Month they were brought into the Hou&s;e of Correction, to work there. But they unwilling to &s;ubmit thereto, the Jailor, who &s;ought his Profit from the Work of his Pri&s;oners, would not give them Victuals, tho' they offered to pay for them. But he told them, <HI>It was not their Money, but their Labour he de&s;ired.</HI> Thus he kept them five Days without Food, and then with a three-corded Whip gave them twenty Blows. An Hour after, he told them, <HI>they might go out, if they would pay the Mar&s;hal that was to lead them out if the Country.</HI> They judging it very unrea&s;onable to pay Money for being bani&s;hed, refu&s;ed this; but yet &s;aid, <HI>That if the Pri&s;on-door was &s;et open, they would go away.</HI> The next Day the Jailor came to <HI>W. Brend,</HI> a Man in Years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barbarous Cruelties.</NOTE> and put him in Irons, Neck and Heels &s;o clo&s;e together, that there was no more Room left between each, than for the Lock that fa&s;tned them. Thus he kept them from Five in the Morning, till after Nine at Night, being the Space of &s;ixteen Hours. The next Morning he brought them to the Mill to work, but <HI>Brend</HI> refu&s;ing, the Jailor took a pitch'd Rope about an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nch thick, and gave him twenty Blows over the Back and Arms, with as much Force as he could, &s;o that the Rope untwi&s;ted; and then going away, he came again with another Rope that was thicker and &s;tronger, and told <HI>Brend, that he would cau&s;e him to bow to the Law of the Country, and make him work. Brend</HI> judged this not only unrea&s;onable in the highe&s;t Degree, &s;ince he had committed no Evil; but he was al&s;o altogether unable to work; for he wanted Strength for want of Food, having been kept five Days without eating, and whipt al&s;o, and now thus unmercifully beaten with a Rope. But this inhuman Jailor relented not, but began to beat anew with his pitch'd Rope, on this brui&s;ed Body, and foaming at his Mouth like a Mad-man, with Violence laid four&s;core and &s;even|teen Blows more on him, as other Pri&s;oners who beheld it with Com|pa&s;&s;ion, have told; and if his Strength, and his Rope had not failed him, he would have laid on more; he threatned al&s;o to give him the next Morning as many Blows more. But a higher Power, who &s;ets Limits even to the raging Sea, and hath &s;aid, <HI>Hitherto &s;halt thou come, but no farther,</HI> al&s;o limited this butcherly Fellow, who was yet impudently &s;tout enough to &s;ay his Morning-prayer. To what a mo&s;t terrible Condition the&s;e Blows brought the Body of <HI>Brend,</HI> (who be|cau&s;e of the great Heat of the Weather, had nothing but a Serge Ca&s;|&s;ock upon his Shirt) may ea&s;ily be conceived: His Back and Arms were brui&s;ed and black, and the Blood hanging as in Bags under his
<PB N="192" REF="003104_0203_0FEFD562F4989980">
Arms; and &s;o into one was his Fle&s;h beaten, that the Sign of a parti|cular blow could not be &s;een; for all was become as a Jelly. His Bo|dy being thus cruelly tortured, he lay down upon the Boards, &s;o ex|treamly weakened, that the natural Parts decaying, and Strength quite failing, his Body turned cold: There &s;eemed as it were a Struggle be|tween Life and Death, his Sen&s;es were &s;topped; and he had for &s;ome Time neither Seeing, Feeling, nor Hearing: Till at length a divine Power prevailing, Life broke thro' Death, and the Breath of the Lord was breathed into his No&s;trils. Now the Noi&s;e of this Cruelty &s;pread among the People in the Town, and cau&s;ed &s;uch a Cry, that the Go|vernor &s;ent his Surgeon to the Pri&s;on to &s;ee what might be done: But the Surgeon found the Body of <HI>Brend</HI> in &s;uch a deplorable Condition, that, as one without Hopes, he &s;aid, <HI>His Fle&s;h would rot off his Bones, ere the brui&s;ed Parts could be brought to dige&s;t.</HI> This &s;o exa&s;perated the People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Magi|&s;trates &s;eem to relent in their Cruelty.</NOTE> that the Rulers to prevent a Tumult, &s;et up a Paper on their Meeting-hou&s;e Door, and up and down the Streets, as it were, to &s;hew their Di&s;like of this abominable, and mo&s;t barbarous Cruelty; and &s;aid, the Jaylor &s;hould be dealt withal the next Court. But this Paper was &s;oon taken down again upon the In&s;tigation of the High-Prie&s;t <HI>John Norton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">But are con|firm'd therein by their Prie&s;ts.</NOTE> (who having from the Beginning been a fierce Promoter of the Per&s;ecution,) now did not &s;tick to &s;ay, <HI>W. Brend endeavour'd to beat our Go&s;pel-Ordinance black and blue; if he then be beaten black and blue, it is but ju&s;t upon him; and I will appear in his Behalf that did &s;o.</HI> It is therefore not much to be wondered at, that the&s;e preci&s;e and bigotted Rulers, who would be look'd upon to be eminent for Piety, were &s;o cruel in per&s;ecuting, &s;ince their chief Teacher thus wickedly encouraged them to it. In the mean while, it plea&s;ed God, even miraculou&s;ly to heal <HI>W. Brend,</HI> and to keep him alive: But as if the Hearts of the&s;e Per&s;e|cutors were more hardened thereby, to &s;hew them&s;elves obedient Followers of their Teacher, they made an Order, that the Jailor, if the <HI>Quakers</HI> that were in his Cu&s;tody refu&s;ed to work, &s;hould whip them twice a Week, the fir&s;t Time with Ten La&s;hes, the next Time with fifteen, and &s;o at each Time with three more, till they would work. This was performed on Four Per&s;ons, two of which were <HI>Wil|liam Leddra</HI> and <HI>John Rous,</HI> who may be mentioned hereafter. And to keep the pa&s;&s;ionate Jailor within due Bonds, for&s;ooth, it was ordered that each Time he &s;hould warn two Con&s;tables to &s;ee the Execution. But how little Moderation was truly meant, and that this was more like a Je&s;t, may appear in that the Jailor the fir&s;t Time laid fifteen La&s;hes a piece on the &s;aid Per&s;ons, and &s;o added five Stripes to the fir&s;t Number of ten.</P>
<P>It happened about this Time that &s;ome of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> that lived there, being had before the Magi&s;trates, it was demanded by one of them, <HI>How they might know a</HI> Quaker? to which <HI>Simon Broad&s;treet,</HI> one of the Magi&s;trates, an&s;wered, <HI>Thou art one, for coming in with thy Hat on.</HI> Which made the other reply, <HI>It was a horrible Thing to make &s;uch cruel Laws, to whip and cut off Ears, and bore thro' the Tongue for not putting off the Hat:</HI> Then one of the Bench &s;aid, <HI>That the</HI> Quakers <HI>held forth Bla&s;phemies at thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Meetings.</HI> To which one of the others de&s;ired, <HI>To make &s;uch a Thing appear, if it were &s;o; that they might be convinced:</HI> And farther, <HI>that they &s;hould do well to &s;end &s;ome to their Meetings, that they might hear, and give Account of what was done and &s;poken there; and not conclude of a Thing they knew not.</HI> But, &s;aid Ma|jor General <HI>Deni&s;on, If ye meet together and &s;ay any Thing, we may con|clude that ye &s;peak Bla&s;phemy.</HI> A very &s;trange Syllogi&s;m indeed. No better to prove Per&s;ecution lawful was the Argument of <HI>Charles Chan&s;ey,</HI> chief Teacher at the Univer&s;ity, who in a Sermon at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> argued
<PB N="193" REF="003104_0204_0FEFF5230861C468">
thus; <HI>Suppo&s;e you &s;hould catch &s;ix Wolves in a Trap, and ye cannot prove that they killed either Sheep or Lambs; and now ye have them, they will neither bark nor bite; yet they have the plain Marks of Wolves, and therefore ye knock them down.</HI> A ba&s;e Expre&s;&s;ion thus to compare a Man to a Bea&s;t; for God &s;aid in plain Terms to <HI>Noah, Who&s;o &s;heddeth Man's Blood, by Man &s;hall his Blood be &s;hed.</HI> But the&s;e Per&s;ecutors thought there was Stre&s;s enough in it, to call the <HI>Quakers</HI> Wolves; and to make one pa&s;s for a <HI>Quaker,</HI> they counted it a &s;ufficient Proof, when they &s;aw he did not put off his Hat to Men: Knock him down, 'tis a Wolf: And if the Hat was not found fault with, &s;omething el&s;e was thought on; for at <HI>Salem</HI> twelve Per&s;ons were fined forty Pounds nineteen Shillings for not coming to Church:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several fined.</NOTE> And of others much Money was extorted, be|cau&s;e their Wives ab&s;ented them&s;elves from the publick Wor&s;hip. <HI>William Mar&s;ton</HI> of <HI>Hampton</HI> was fined Ten Pounds for two Books found in his Hou&s;e, <HI>viz. John Lilburn</HI>'s <HI>Re&s;urrection,</HI> and <HI>W. Duesbury</HI>'s <HI>Mighty Day of the Lord.</HI> Thus the&s;e People did whatever they would, with|out any Regard to the Laws in <HI>Old England:</HI> And when once &s;ome Pri|&s;oners appeal'd to it, the Governor <HI>John Endicot,</HI> and his Deputy <HI>Bel|lingham</HI> cry'd, <HI>No Appeal to</HI> England! <HI>No Appeal to</HI> England! And they &s;eem'd to fear nothing for what they did to the <HI>Quakers;</HI> according to what Major General <HI>Deni&s;on</HI> &s;aid in open Court; <HI>This Year you'll go and complain to the Parliament; the next Year they'll &s;end &s;ome to &s;ee how Things go; and in the third Year the Government will be chang'd.</HI> Now they not at all caring for Old <HI>England,</HI> denied al&s;o the Pri&s;oners their Re|que&s;t of being tried according to the Laws of that Realm, by a Jury. And the Rulers dealing thus arbitrarily,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial by a Ju|ry refus'd.</NOTE> the Jailor of the Hou&s;e of Correction did the like; for when &s;ome of his Pri&s;oners &s;hewed them|&s;elves not unwilling to work, provided that their Families &s;hould have &s;omething of the Gain, he would not allow that, unle&s;s they paid him Eight Pence from every Twelve Pence Gain: And when they re|fu&s;ed this, the Whipping-po&s;t was his Refuge.</P>
<P>But to go on; In the foregoing Year, Mention was made of <HI>John Copeland</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;topher Holder:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J. Copeland</HI> and <HI>C.

This gave Encouragement to the Magi&s;trates, for &s;ince the Churchmen pu&s;hed on &s;o wicked a Bu&s;ine&s;s, no Scruple was made to go on with this bloody Work: And the Court of Magi&s;trates voted it to be put in Execution by a Country-Court, which three Magi&s;trates made up, the Majority of which might hang at Plea&s;ure, without Trial by a Jury; a Thing not heard of in <HI>Old England:</HI> But it &s;erved the Purpo&s;e

<HEAD>THE HISTORY Of the CHRISTIAN PEOPLE called QUAKERS. The FIFTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Fore-part of the Year, 1659, there was great Di&s;cord,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1659</HI> Publick Af|fairs.</NOTE> and &s;everal Factions among the People in <HI>England;</HI> for &s;ome adhered to the Protector <HI>Richard,</HI> and others to the chief Members of the Long Parliament; and the Royali&s;ts made al&s;o a Party. <HI>G. Fox</HI> being under a Concern le&s;t &s;ome young or raw People, who &s;ometimes came among&s;t his Friends, might be drawn into &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;everal Inte|re&s;ts, wrote an Epi&s;tle, warning &s;uch to be careful, and not at all to meddle with any Plotting, but to con&s;ider that their Warfare was a &s;piritual one, not at all wanting the U&s;e of carnal Weapons.</P>
<P>About this Time <HI>William Caton</HI> came again into <HI>Holland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Caton</HI> at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and what pa&s;s'd there.</NOTE> and (finding at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> &s;ome malicious People, who endeavoured to bring his Fellow-Believers there into Trouble, and to &s;tir up the Mob again&s;t them, that &s;o the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> might take Occa&s;ion to look upon the <HI>Quakers</HI> as Rioters,) advi&s;ed tho&s;e of that Per&s;ua&s;ion to be circum&s;pect, and to avoid as much as po&s;&s;ibly they could, the impending Storm. In Order thereto, it was thought meet that their religious Meetings, which on the Week-Days were kept pretty late at Night, on the Fir&s;t-Days of the Week &s;hould not always be kept in one Place, but &s;ometimes in this, and at other Times in another Hou&s;e: Sometimes a Meeting was kept in an Alley, at the Town-Wall near the Regulars-Gate, where &s;eve|ral <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> People dwelt, from whence it was called the <HI>Engli&s;h Alley,</HI> and has that Name &s;till: Hither came very rude Company, committing great In&s;olence. The Time before that <HI>W. Caton</HI> was in <HI>Holland,</HI> he met with an extraordinary rude Encounter at the &s;aid Place, in&s;omuch that he &s;eemed in Danger of his Life; for &s;ome wicked People, not daring to do their utmo&s;t in the Hou&s;e where he was, pu&s;h'd him out of Doors; but then a Woman pulled him into her Hou&s;e, where he was &s;afe, tho' at fir&s;t he knew not whether he was among Friends or Foes. I yet well remember this Fact, being at that Time with my Parents in the &s;aid di&s;turbed Meeting. Now <HI>Caton</HI> being a di&s;creet and judicious Per&s;on, and perceiving that &s;ome of his Friends there had more of a ra&s;h Zeal than true Wi&s;dom, advi&s;ed the mo&s;t moderate of them often to change Meeting-places. In the Beginning, a Meeting was kept now and then in St. <HI>John-&s;treet,</HI> &s;o called, and afterwards on <HI>Eland</HI>'s <HI>Graff,</HI> in an Alley at the Hou&s;e of one <HI>Richard Langham,</HI> and al&s;o on the <HI>Angelier's Graff,</HI> in the Hou&s;e of my Father; and &s;ome Time after in the <HI>Engli&s;h Alley</HI> above&s;aid, and al&s;o without the Town, near the River <HI>Am&s;tel,</HI> in <HI>Kuy|pers Padt,</HI> or <HI>Cooper's-Lane;</HI> from whence the Meeting was removed in the Forepart of this Year (if my Memory doth not deceive me) into the <HI>Verwers Padt,</HI> or <HI>Dyers-Lane,</HI> which was then without the City-Free|dom, and the Meeting-place was in a large Garret of a Tanner's Hou&s;e, where oftentimes came abundance of People, and among the&s;e, not a few of the rude Rabble. Here the Meeting was continu'd till the Year 1663, when that Place came into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another Owner.</P>

Ames</HI> at the Court of the <HI>Elector Palatine.</HI> Is kindly treated by the <HI>Elector.</HI></NOTE> after &s;ome Stay in <HI>Holland,</HI> return'd again to <HI>England.</HI> I think it was in this Year that <HI>William Ames</HI> went into <HI>Germany,</HI> where being come into the Palatinate, he went to <HI>Heidelburgh,</HI> and came to the Court of the Prince Elector, <HI>Charles Lod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wick,</HI> who treated him kindly, even at his own Table, and &s;eemed not to take Offence at <HI>Ames</HI>'s Hat, which he kept on, tho' the Lords and others that were in the Company, &s;tood bare-headed. The Baron of <HI>Helmont,</HI> who al&s;o was at that Court, was wont to tell afterwards, That <HI>Ames</HI> walking once with his Hat on, next to the Prince in his Garden, the Courtiers ask'd the Prince, Whether they &s;hould que&s;tion <HI>Ames</HI> for this Incivility: But the Prince &s;aid, <HI>No, for I did expect that.</HI> At another Time the Prince made his Chaplain and <HI>Ames</HI> both dine with him, on Purpo&s;e, as it &s;eems, that <HI>Ames,</HI> whom he knew to be a bold Man, might find Oc|ca&s;ion to reprove his Chaplain; for at Meat he &s;uffered his Je&s;ter to come, who playing his Tricks, the Chaplain was &s;ilent: But <HI>Ames,</HI> who loved Gravity, and was aver&s;e to Je&s;ting, took Occa&s;ion from thence to reprove &s;uch vain Actions; but chiefly he aimed at the Chaplain, whom becau&s;e of his Silence at the lewd Behaviour of the Je&s;ter, he called, <HI>A dumb Dog;</HI> which &s;eemed to plea&s;e the Prince.</P>
<P>Now whil&s;t <HI>William Ames</HI> was in the Palatinate, he got Acquaintance with the <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> at <HI>Krie&s;heim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">At <HI>Krie|&s;heim, Bap|ti&s;ts</HI> receive his Doctrine, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d after &s;et|tle in <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> be|fore the Wars.</NOTE> a Town not far from <HI>Worms;</HI> and among tho&s;e People he found &s;uch Entrance, that &s;ome Families receiving the Doctrine he preached, bore a publick Te&s;timony for it there, and &s;o continued till the Settlement of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> when they unanimou&s;ly went thither, not as it &s;eemed, without a &s;ingular Direction of Providence; for not long after, a War en&s;ued in <HI>Germany,</HI> where the Palatinate was altogether laid wa&s;te by the <HI>French,</HI> and thou&s;ands of People were bereft of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and reduced to Poverty.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Ames,</HI> when &s;ome in the Palatinate began to give an Ear to his Preaching, a Fine was &s;ettled again&s;t tho&s;e that gave him Entertainment:<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is favor'd by the <HI>Elector</HI> and his Si&s;ter.</NOTE> But the Prince Elector being informed hereof, took off that Fine; and tho' tho&s;e of the Con&s;i&s;tory did &s;end for <HI>Ames,</HI> the Prince generou&s;ly order'd them not to meddle with him. The Prince's Si&s;ter al&s;o behaved her &s;elf very kindly towards him, and received his Exhortations favourably.</P>
<P>A Year after,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ames</HI> with <HI>J. Higgins</HI> again kindly received by the <HI>Elector.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ames</HI> came again into the Palatinate, with <HI>John Hig|gins,</HI> and vi&s;iting the Prince Elector, he under&s;tood from the Captain of the Prince's Guard, that the Prince was glad of <HI>Ames</HI>'s Return thither. A while after, <HI>Higgins</HI> delivered to the Prince Elector a Book of <HI>G. Fox,</HI> with a Letter of <HI>Ames</HI> to the &s;aid Prince, who was &s;o well pleas'd with it, that he bad <HI>Higgins</HI> to thank <HI>Ames</HI> on his Behalf, &s;aying al&s;o that he took the Coming of <HI>Ames</HI> and <HI>Higgins</HI> to him and his Family very kindly, and really believed that what they &s;poke, was in Love to their Souls.</P>
<P>Several Years after this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And their Friends from <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> &s;ome others of <HI>Ames</HI>'s Friends from <HI>Eng|land</HI> vi&s;ited rhe afore&s;aid Prince Elector, and he always (to his Prai&s;e be it &s;aid) received them kindly. <HI>W.

<PB N="199" REF="003104_0210_0FEFF52AB46C0370">
began to a&s;&s;ert it as Truth; and &s;eeing now and then he with &s;ome of his &s;ober Neighbours, kept a Meeting at his Hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Occa&s;ion thereof.</NOTE> this cau&s;ed a great Stir in the Town, in&s;omuch that &s;ometimes he &s;uffered rude Treatment from the People. <HI>Ames</HI> coming once there, and keeping a Meeting in <HI>Martin</HI>'s Hou&s;e, great In&s;olence was committed by the wicked Rabble. And going from thence to pa&s;s over the Water to <HI>Gouwerek,</HI> he was fol|lowed by a Multitude of riotous People, both young and old, with a hi|deous Cry of <HI>Quake, Quake, Quake!</HI> and was pelted with Stones and Clods, till he came to the Boat that carried him over. The Preacher of <HI>Gou|werek</HI> hearing the Noi&s;e, came to the Boat, and ask'd, <HI>What the Matter was, why People made &s;uch a &s;ad Noi&s;e?</HI> To which <HI>Ames</HI> an&s;wer'd, <HI>It &s;eems the People are not taught better.</HI> To which the Preacher return'd, <HI>They are not u&s;ed to make &s;uch ado again&s;t hone&s;t People; but I believe you to be a deceiving Wolf, that comes among the Sheep to &s;educe them, and that therefore they cry &s;o.

I dont know you,</HI> &s;aid the Preach|er. <HI>Learn then,</HI> return'd <HI>Ames, better Manners, than to call one thou know|e&s;t not, a Wolf and a Deceiver.</HI> And &s;o going his Way, &s;hortly after he wrote from <HI>Rotterdam</HI> to <HI>Martin,</HI> and bad him go to the Preacher, and de&s;ire him to appoint a Time to prove <HI>that</HI> Ames <HI>was a deceiving Wolf.</HI> But to this, the Preacher &s;hew'd him&s;elf backward; yet to be rid of <HI>Martin,</HI> he &s;aid at length, <HI>Come, I'll prove it pre&s;ently.</HI> But <HI>Martin</HI> re|ply'd, <HI>I am not come for that; but this mu&s;t be done to</HI> Ames; and in&s;i&s;t|ing thereon, <HI>Well,</HI> &s;aid the Preacher, <HI>Let him come next</HI> Sunday <HI>before Noon, after Sermon; then I'll prove it publickly before all People.</HI></P>
<P>Of this <HI>Martin</HI> &s;ent Word to <HI>Ames;</HI> but Things were managed &s;o, that this Project of Proof was qua&s;h'd: For the Preacher of <HI>Gouwerek</HI> went to his Colleague at <HI>Moordrecht,</HI> and con&s;ulted with him what to do in the Ca&s;e; and <HI>Ames</HI> being come to <HI>Moordrecht</HI> on the fir&s;t Day of the Month called <HI>March,</HI> and the la&s;t of the Week, tho' it was late at Night, was &s;een and known by &s;ome, who committed much Vio|lence upon the Hou&s;e of <HI>Martin,</HI> where <HI>Ames</HI> was entered. The next Day it was reported that &s;ome of the Sheriff's Men of <HI>Gouda</HI> were come to <HI>Gouwerek,</HI> to apprehend <HI>Ames</HI> when he came there; and at <HI>Moordrecht,</HI> the Dikegrave's Men came to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; and &s;o they took <HI>Ames</HI> Pri&s;oner, and carried him to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> where he was lock'd up in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> as a Madman. And a Week after, <HI>Martin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">As is al&s;o <HI>M.

<P>After <HI>Ames</HI> had been not much above three Weeks in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> the Under-Governor of the Hou&s;e, on the 27th of the Month about Night, came to him and <HI>Martin,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>If I was in your Place, I would go out.</HI> Which made <HI>Ames</HI> ask, <HI>Whether he would &s;uffer them to do &s;o?</HI> To which he an&s;wered, <HI>That he &s;hould not hinder them.</HI> Then <HI>Ames return'd, I won't be reputed as one that broke Pri&s;on.</HI> To which the Deputy reply'd, <HI>Nay, why &s;hould you be reputed &s;o? You may go out freely; all is unlock'd, and the Door will &s;tand open for you: For the Governors are not minded that you &s;hould &s;tay here.</HI> Then <HI>Ames</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Well, I intend to go out to Morrow.</HI> The next Day <HI>Martin</HI>'s Wife came to &s;ee her Husband; but the Deputy told her, that he had an Order in Writing from the Dikegrave, that ra|ther than to let <HI>Martin</HI>'s Wife come to him, he might let him and <HI>Ames</HI> go out together. The I&s;&s;ue was, that they were both let out that Morning, it being the 28th of the Month. But they &s;taid at <HI>Rot|terdam,</HI> intending not to depart the Town before they had given No|tice to the Dikegrave of their being let out; le&s;t any Qcca&s;ion might
<PB N="200" REF="003104_0211_0FEFD57CECA00E98">
be given for &s;aying that they had broken Pri&s;on. And it was not with|out Rea&s;on they were &s;o cautious: For the next Day in the Morn|ing, the Deputy came to them, and &s;aid, <HI>I de&s;ire that you won't bring me into Trouble; for I am am an ancient Man, and the</HI> Dikegrave <HI>hath been with me, and ask'd for you:</HI> To which I an&s;wer'd, <HI>That you were gone out; but he took this very ill. I de&s;ire therefore that you would &s;ay, that you were gone out without my Knowledge.</HI> But this was not to be expected from <HI>Ames,</HI> whom I knew &s;o well, that I truly believe he would rather have died, than to have &s;poken a Lie: For in &s;uch a Ca&s;e he was without Que&s;tion, of the &s;ame Mind as formerly <HI>Chri&s;tian Languedol,</HI> Uncle of my Grandmother by the Mother's Side, who when at <HI>Ant|werp,</HI> he, with other Martyrs, was led to the Stake to be burnt, cry'd out immediately, and with a valiant Mind, <HI>If we would once but have told a Lye, we might have e&s;caped this.</HI> But to return to <HI>Ames,</HI> he told the Deputy, <HI>That he him&s;elf intended to go and &s;peak with the</HI> Dikegrave, <HI>and if he was di&s;plea&s;ed at their going out, he might put them in again where they had been; for they would not have the Name of Pri&s;on-breakers.</HI> Then they both went to the <HI>Dikegrave,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Di&s;|cour&s;e with the <HI>Dike|grave.</HI></NOTE> and told him after what Manner they were come out; &s;aying al&s;o, that they would not have it &s;aid, that they broke out. <HI>That Name,</HI> &s;aid the Dikegrave, <HI>you would have had, if you had departed the Town; for the Deputy hath told me that you got out by breaking a Window.</HI> After &s;ome other Words were exchanged, he further &s;aid, <HI>I have nothing to object again&s;t your Life and Conver&s;ation, having heard no|thing concerning you but a good Report; neither do I &s;eek to per&s;ecute you. But would you be willing to return to</HI> Bedlam? <HI>Ames</HI> an&s;wer'd, <HI>Here we &s;tand before thee, thou may'&s;t do with us according to thy Plea&s;ure.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>Wherefore all ye Rulers, and all ye that have trodden down the Heritage of God, and ye that have di&s;regarded tho&s;e many Warnings that ye have had; I &s;ay unto you all, in the Power of the Lord God,
<PB N="202" REF="003104_0213_0FEFD57F02C0AA88">
in his Dominion, and by his Spirit; this is once more a Warning to you from the Lord, and that the&s;e Things mu&s;t &s;urely come to pa&s;s, and be fulfilled in their Sea&s;on, and no Man &s;hall be able to deliver his Brother; but every Man &s;hall bear his own Burthen, and drink his own Cup, prepared for him; and tho' it hath been counted a light Thing among you, and you have de&s;pi&s;ed the Reproof, and gone on without Fear; yet in as much as the Lord hath &s;pared you, and not &s;peedily executed Judgment upon you, but rather waited for your Return; yet the Dealing of the Lord towards you, in &s;paring of you, you have not accepted; and therefore &s;hall his Judgments be the greater upon you, For if you do now come to the Witne&s;s in your own Con&s;ciences, What Evil have this People done? Who&s;e Ox have they taken, or what have they de&s;ired of you? Or what have they &s;ought from you? Or wherein have they been a Burthen to you? Saving that they have reproved you for your Iniquities, and de&s;ired your Redemption? Would you but now at la&s;t come to con|&s;ider this, and confe&s;s the Truth in your Con&s;ciences; will not that tell you, that they have patiently &s;uffered all Things that you have cruelly impo&s;ed upon them? And have not they walked peaceably to|wards you, and humbly, meekly and ju&s;tly among their Neighbours? And have they not been meek and innocent, even as Lambs, and as Sheep before the Shearers? and have they wrought Offences towards any? Have they &s;ought the Overthrow of the Government, or have they &s;ought Vengeance again&s;t their Enemies? Or what Injury have they done to any Man's Per&s;on or E&s;tate, &s;aving to Satan and his Kingdom? Have they not &s;ought to reform and reclaim the Ungodly from their Ways? And have they not pitied and prayed for their E|nemies? And have they not in all Things walked in good Con&s;cience towards the Lord, and towards all Men? Yea, my Friends, in the Day of the Lord, when the Witne&s;s in your Con&s;ciences &s;hall not be limited, but &s;hall &s;peak plainly, and when the impartial Judge &s;hall appear upon his Throne, then &s;hall you acknowledge the&s;e Things.
Wherefore I &s;ay unto you, receive the Judgment of the Lord, to purify you, otherwi&s;e the Judgment &s;hall de&s;troy you; and now come to be more wi&s;e, that &s;ome of you may be as a Brand pluck'd out of the Fire, and be re&s;erved from being con&s;umed; for the Vi&s;itation of the Lord is near an End, when his loving Kindne&s;s will be &s;hut from you, and his Long-&s;uffering turned into Fury; and he will make you know that we are his People, with whom you have thus dealt; yea, you &s;hall &s;uddenly know it; the Time is not long till he will crown his People in the Sight of his Enemies; he will crown them with Prai&s;e and with Righteou&s;ne&s;s, with Honour and Maje&s;ty, and he will keep them in Safety, even when Sorrow compa&s;&s;es you a|bout; his Mercy and loving Kindne&s;s &s;hall extend towards them, e|ven when his Wrath and Judgments doth &s;mite you, and confound you. O! what &s;hall I &s;ay unto you; for the deep Sen&s;e thereof re|mains upon my Heart; for when I con&s;ider, how that in all Ages the Lord did avenge his People's Cau&s;e, and when the Time of their Suffering was expired, he broke the Bonds of Iniquity, and &s;et them free. Thus did he with his People <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of old, and many Times it was his Way with his People, to bring them low by Suffering, and then to rai&s;e them up again in Glory; and he &s;uffered their Ene|mies for a Sea&s;on to glory over them, that he might bring them down. And thus he did in <HI>England,</HI> in the Ca&s;e between the Bi&s;hops and their Crew of Per&s;ecutors, and the poor People at that Day called <HI>Puritans:</HI> Did not he confound that per&s;ecuting Crew, and deliver his People? And is not he the &s;ame to effect the &s;ame Work at this very Day?
<PB N="203" REF="003104_0214_0FEFF52FA3D58DB0">
Yea, doubtle&s;s, and much more will he do, ina&s;much as the Mani|fe&s;tation of Truth is more clear than it was in their Days; and in as much as the Rulers and People of this Nation have rejected a more clear Te&s;timony, than either the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> in Quoen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Days, or the Bi&s;hops and Prelates in their Days; even &s;o much the more will the Lord execute his Vengeance with more Violence, in a more manife&s;t Way; and all &s;hall know, that it is he that doth it, and he will &s;et his People free; for he hath regarded their Sufferings, and he hath &s;aid, it is enough; for he hath tried them, and found them faithful; and all this hath been &s;uffered to prove them, and not to de&s;troy them: And like as he hath pre&s;erved them in Patience and Peace thro' it all, even &s;o will he give them Hearts to walk an&s;werably to their Delive|rance; and us they have abounded in Patience in their Suffering, &s;o &s;hall they abound in Pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e everla&s;ting in the Day of their Freedom, and the Earth &s;hall be glad, and &s;hall yield the Increa&s;e and Ble&s;&s;ing; the Hea|ven and Earth &s;hall rejoice, and the Hearts of the Righteous &s;hall leap for Joy, when the Lord hath broken the Yoke of the oppre&s;&s;ed, and &s;et his People free, inwardly and outwardly; and then &s;hall they &s;ing to the Lord over all their Enemies, who &s;hall be tormented and vexed in the Lord's &s;ore Di&s;plea&s;ure; for their Reward cometh, and their Recompence &s;hall be even as their Work, and he will give un|to them Sorrow and Angui&s;h, in&s;tead of Rejoicing.
But again when I con&s;idered the long Suffering, and Patience, and Forbearance of the Lord's innocent People under all their Sufferings; and when I looked at their Innocency, and at their Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Spirit of Holine&s;s with which the Lord had ble&s;&s;ed them, my Heart was made glad in the Con&s;ideration of this; and the more was my Joy, the more I beheld their Innocency, and the Guiltle&s;ne&s;s of their Cau&s;e, whereby the Unju&s;tne&s;s of their Suffering did the more appear; and withal, when I looked and beheld their Increa&s;e under all their Sufferings, and how that the Lord had turned all the&s;e Things to their Good, and to the Overthrow of all their Enemies; how that by that Way, wherein their Enemies intended to de&s;troy them from being a People, even thereby did the Lord mo&s;t wonderfully increa&s;e them to be a great People; for thro' all have they grown in Life and Power, and in Strength, and in Number, and thro' it all have they been encouraged to follow the Lord with more Zeal and Boldne&s;s. Add in the Con&s;ideration of this I did rejoice, with magnifying the Lord for ever, that he had brought forth his Prai&s;e, even thro' the Wickedne&s;s of the Wicked, and he had increa&s;ed his People, and exalted them thro' the Cruelty of all their Enemies; and that thro' all Oppo&s;ition they were attain'd unto a happy Re&s;t, and thro' all the Tempe&s;t of great Trials, they were arrived into the Harbour of Renown and great Glory: And wher I con&s;ider this, how that the Lord had given them Dominion, and brought their Life to reign over all their Enemies, the&s;e Things were a Joy unto me; and looking back into Ages, &s;eeing there was nothing, nor any People for Generations, that had grown, and ri&s;en thro' all Oppo&s;i|tion like unto the&s;e, wherefore it is a Sign and a Te&s;timony that we are the Lord's, and that the&s;e Things are of him, and from him, and by him alone, that he might be prai&s;ed for ever.
Again, when I do con&s;ider, how that the Lord hath rai&s;ed his People, even out of the Du&s;t; and them that were not a People, are become a People; and the Lord hath provoked Nations by them that were not a People within the&s;e few Years; and the Lord hath carried on this Work among his People, not by any Thing of Man, nor by the Arm of Fle&s;h, but in pure Innoceney and Simplicity hath
<PB N="204" REF="003104_0215_0FEFF4F22C4511A0">
it been accompli&s;hed; not by the Wi&s;dom of this World, nor by Men in Places of Honour, and of Power in the Nations; for all that has been wanting to them, and what they are, it is thro' the Oppo|&s;ition of all this; for they have had none of the great Men of the Earth on their Side to defend them, and e&s;tabli&s;h them, but all have been again&s;t them, and even Oppre&s;&s;ion and Tyranny executed upon them, rather than any Approbation, or Ju&s;tification from Men in outward Authority: So that truly it may be &s;aid, there hath been nothing of Man in this Work, but all of the Lord, by his own Pow|er, and in a contrary Way to all the fal&s;e Sects, and fal&s;e Churches, hath the Beginning and carrying on of the&s;e Things been; for we know that all the fal&s;e Sects in this Nation have ri&s;en, and been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed thro' the Countenance of Men in Place and Power, and upon Man, and the Wi&s;dom of this World, and Authority of the Powers of the Earth, hath the Ri&s;e and Fall of all fal&s;e Churches depended: And as the Powers of the Earth have &s;ided with them, &s;o have they been &s;et up; and at the Di&s;plea&s;ure of Authority, have been ca&s;t down. But as for this People, they are rai&s;ed of the Lord, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by him, even contrary to all Men; and they have given their Pow|er only to God, and they cannot give their Power to any mortal Men, to &s;tand or fall by any outward Authority, and to that they cannot &s;eek; but to the Lord alone, who heareth their Cry, and will avenge their Cau&s;e.
Wherefore let all the Per&s;ecutors bow before the Lord, and let all the Saints walk humbly in his Sight, and let them continue in that innocent Life in which they have begun; and let them never forget the Mercies of the Lord, and what he hath brought to pa&s;s, who hath manife&s;ted great Things, and will do more and more to the con|founding of all his Enemies, and to the Prai&s;e of his elect People. And all ye Saints upon the Earth, have ye the Lord in Re&s;pect continually, and turn you not unto Idols, but let the Lord be your Joy for evermore.</P>

<P><HI>The mighty Day of the Lord is come and coming upon you, and all the World: Awake, awake, ye that &s;leep in the Earth, for the dreadful God is ari&s;ing to plead with you, and to give unto all the World the Cup of his fierce Indig|nation, becau&s;e of your Idolatries, and Hypocri&s;ies, and Abominations, which have corrupted the Earth, and are come up before him, and have provoked him; and the Cry of the Ju&s;t, who hath been &s;mitten and laid &s;lain, is entred into the Ears of the Mo&s;t High, and his Sword, which is the Word of his Mouth, is awakened to wound and &s;lay all his Enemies. And the Day of your Vi&s;ita|tion is now come, wherein the Lord is &s;earching you, and trying you, that he may recompence you: And this is the Word of the Lord to you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wherefore I am moved of the Lord to propound &s;ome few</HI> Queries <HI>to you, for the Trial of your Spirits and Ways; to which I demand your An&s;wer, that all Things may be brought to Light and true Judgment, and that you may be judged ju&s;tly, and by the Spirit of the Lord cleared, or condemned, according to your Deeds.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Queries</HI> were partly concerning the Orders of Friars and Nuns, whether any &s;uch were in the Church in the Apo&s;tles Days; and concern|ing the Popi&s;h Wor&s;hip and Ceremonies, demanding Proof of their Law|fulne&s;s from the holy Scriptures. After the delivering of the&s;e <HI>Queries</HI> to the <HI>Capuchins, Burroughs</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;her</HI> went al&s;o to the Friars of other Orders, and entred into Di&s;cour&s;e with them: But their plain Speeches again&s;t their Idolatrous Rites and Ceremonies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;cour&s;e with tho&s;e of other Orders.</NOTE> found no Entrance. After &s;ome Stay in the Town, they going to the College of the Je&s;uits, got into Di&s;cour&s;e with their chief Rector; and after a Conference of about three Hours, he grew weary, and pretending other Bu&s;ine&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And with the chief Rec|tor of the Je|&s;uits.</NOTE> would &s;tay no longer with them; and &s;o they parted, asking him, <HI>Whether he would ad|mit more Di&s;cour&s;e at &s;ome other Time?</HI> But he refu&s;ed it. <HI>Burroughs</HI> after|wards wrote a Letter to him, which began thus:</P>
<P>Friend, <HI>Thy Wi&s;dom and thy Knowledge is earthly and &s;en&s;ual,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writes to him.</NOTE> and thereby can&s;t thou not know the Things of the Kingdom of God;</HI> And he concluded with this Query: <HI>What is that Whore that hath &s;ate upon Multitudes of People!

<P>But neither this <HI>Query,</HI> nor the others were an&s;wered. <HI>Burroughs</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;her</HI> did al&s;o vi&s;it the Nuns; and &s;peaking to them thro' a Grate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nor this, nor others an&s;we|red.</NOTE> they asked, <HI>If they were of the Order of tho&s;e called</HI> Quakers; and &s;oon perceiv|ing they were &s;uch, they &s;aid, <HI>They might not hear them,</HI> and &s;o pre&s;ently pa&s;&s;ed away; whereby <HI>Burroughs</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;her</HI> were deprived of an Opportu|nity to &s;peak to them; only they witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t them. <HI>E.

<P>The Power of the Protector <HI>Richard Cromwel</HI> already declining,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of State</NOTE> he was prevailed upon by the Officers of the Army to di&s;&s;olve this Par|liament, which began to make Enquiry how the Sub&s;idies were em|ploy'd: And by the Direction of &s;ome of the chief Republicans, the Long Parliament was called again. This Parliament &s;et up a <HI>Com|mittee of Safety,</HI> for apprehending tho&s;e that di&s;turbed the Peace, and for making an Alteration among the military Officers, either by ca|&s;heering them, or otherwi&s;e; and encrea&s;ing in Power, erected al&s;o a <HI>Council of State;</HI> and Word was &s;ent to <HI>Richard Cromwel,</HI> who was now deprived of all Power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R.

<P>About this Time, al&s;o the Military Officers moved the Taking off of the Burthen of Tithes, and to &s;ettle another Maintenance for the National Preachers.

<P>Now the Council of Officers was for calling a new Parliament; but this met with no &s;mall Oppo&s;ition.

But to return to <HI>Daniel</HI> and <HI>Provided,</HI> there wanted nothing but the Execution of the &s;aid Order again&s;t them. Wherefore <HI>Ed|mund Butter,</HI> one of the Trea&s;urers, to get &s;omething of the Booty, &s;ought out for Pa&s;&s;age, to &s;end them to <HI>Barbadoes</HI> for Sale; but none were willing to take or carry them: And a certain Ma&s;ter of a Ship, to put the Thing off, pretended, <HI>That thy would &s;poil all the Ship's Com|pany.</HI> To which <HI>Butter</HI> returned, <HI>No, you need not fear that, for they are poor harmle&s;s Creatures, and will not hurt any Body.

It happened al&s;o in this Year, that a Girl, about eleven Years old, named <HI>Patience Scot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Girl 11 Tears &s;ent to Pri&s;on.</NOTE> who&s;e religious Mother had been cruelly whipt by the&s;e People, bore Witne&s;s again&s;t their wicked Per&s;ecution; which &s;o incen&s;ed the Per&s;ecutors, that they &s;ent her to Pri&s;on: And the Child having been examined, &s;poke &s;o well to the Purpo&s;e, that &s;he confounded her Enemies;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An&s;wers no|tably.</NOTE> &s;ome of which confe&s;t, that they had many Children, who had been well educated; and <HI>That it were well if they could &s;ay half &s;o much for God, as &s;he could for the Devil.</HI> But this Child not being of Years to be obnoxious to the Law, how wicked &s;oever they were, it &s;eems they could not re&s;olve to proceed to Bani&s;hment, as they did with others.</P>
<P>All that hitherto I have &s;aid of the <HI>New-England</HI> Per&s;ecution, is but cur&s;orily, and only a very &s;mall Part of tho&s;e manifold Whippings that were inflicted there, be&s;ides the Extortions of Fines which were exorbi|tant to a high Degree;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W.

And making Enquiry after tho&s;e that entertained him, he took into Cu&s;tody two Women on that Occa&s;ion, one of which had two &s;mall Children, the one yet &s;ucking at her Brea&s;t. Then they got a Cart and carried the Woman away in it, and <HI>Robert</HI> was fa&s;tened to the hinder Part of the Cart, pinioned, and &s;o drawn thro' the Woods in the Night Sea&s;on, whereby he was much torn and abu&s;ed.

Some Time after, he was examined, there being one Captain <HI>Willet,</HI> of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> who had much incen&s;ed the Governour again&s;t him, who before had been mo|derate. The Conclu&s;ion was, that a Sentence was read in <HI>Dutch to Robert,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His cruel and unrighteous Sentence, and Treatment.</NOTE> to this Effect, <HI>That he was to work two Years at the Wheel-barrow with a</HI> Negro, <HI>or pay or cau&s;e to be paid Six hundred Guilders.</HI> To this he attempted to make his Defence in a &s;ober Way, but was not &s;uffered to &s;peak, and &s;ent to the Dungeon again; where no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were &s;uf|fered to come to him. After &s;ome Days he was taken out, and pinion'd and being &s;et with his Face towards the Court-chamber, his Hat was taken off, and another Sentence read to him in <HI>Dutch,</HI> which he did not under&s;tand: But that it di&s;plea&s;ed many of that Nation, did appear by the Shaking of their Heads. Then he was ca&s;t again into the Dun|geon, where he was kept &s;ome Days. At length betimes in a Morn|ing, he was haled out, and chained to a Wheel-barrow, and command|ed to work: To which he an&s;wered, <HI>He was never brought up, nor u&s;ed to &s;uch a Work.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its rigorous and barba|rous Executi|on.</NOTE> Upon which they made a Negro to take a pitch'd Rope, nigh four Inches about, and to beat him; who did &s;o, till <HI>Robert</HI> fell down. Then they took him up again, and cau&s;ed the Negro to beat him with the &s;aid Rope, until he fell down the &s;econd Time, and it was believed that he received about one Hundred Blows. Thus he was kept all that Day in the Heat of the Sun, chained to the Wheel-barrow; and his Body being much brui&s;ed and &s;welled with the Blows, and he kept without Food, grew very faint, and &s;ate upon the Ground, with his Mind retired to the Lord, and re&s;igned to his Will, whereby he felt him&s;elf &s;upported. At Night he was lock'd up again in the Dungeon; and the next Morning he was chain'd again to the Wheel-barrow, and a Sentinel &s;et over him, that none might come &s;o much as to &s;peak with him. On the third Day he was had forth, and chained in like Manner; and no Wonder that he &s;till refu&s;ed to work; for be&s;ides the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of requiring &s;uch a &s;ervile Work of him who had committed no Evil, he was not in a Condition to perform it, being made altogether unable by the cruel Blows given him.

they could not keep him &s;ilent, they put him into the Dungeon again, and kept him clo&s;e there &s;everal Days, and two Nights, one Day and a half of it, without Bread or Water. After this he was brought very early in the Morning into a private Room,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is hung up by up Hands and whipt.</NOTE> and &s;tript to the Wa&s;te, and hung up by his Hands, and a great Leg of Wood tied to his Feet, &s;o that he could not turn his Body, and then a &s;trong Negro was &s;et to whip him with Rods; who laid many Stripes upon him, which cut his Fle&s;h ve|ry much. Then he was let down again, and put into the Dungeon as be|fore, and none &s;uffered to come to him. Two Days after, he was had forth again, and hung up as before, and many more Stripes were laid upon him by another Negro. He almo&s;t fainting, and not knowing but his Life might be taken away, de&s;ired that &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might be &s;uffered to come to him: Which was granted, and an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woman came, and wa&s;hed his Stripes, finding him brought &s;o low, that &s;he thought he would not live till the next Morning.

<P>Now tho' <HI>Mary Dyar</HI> and <HI>Nicholas Davis</HI> left that Juri&s;diction for that Time, yet <HI>Robin&s;on</HI> and <HI>Steven&s;on,</HI> tho' they departed the Town of <HI>Bo|&s;ton,</HI> could not yet re&s;olve (not being free in Mind) to depart that Ju|ri&s;diction, tho' their Lives were at Stake.

it &s;o to be; nor can the Enemy that &s;tirreth you up thus to de&s;troy this holy Seed, in any Mea&s;ure countervail the great Damage that you will, by thus doing, procure. Therefore &s;eeing the Lord hath not hid it from me, it lieth upon me, in Love to your Souls, thus to per&s;wade you. I have no Self-ends, the Lord knoweth; for if my Life were freely granted by you, it would not avail me, nor could I expect it of you, &s;o long as I &s;hould daily hear or &s;ee the Sufferings of the&s;e People, my dear Brethren, and the Seed, with whom my Life is bound up, as I have done the&s;e two Years; and now it is like to encrea&s;e, even unto Death, for no evil Doing, but coming among you. Was ever the like Laws heard of among a People that pro|fe&s;s Chri&s;t come in the Fle&s;h? And have &s;uch no other Weapons but &s;uch Laws to fight again&s;t &s;piritual Wickedne&s;s withal, as you call it? Woe is me for you? Of whom take ye Coun&s;el? Search with the Light of Chri&s;t in you, and it will &s;hew you of whom, as it hath done me and many more, who have been di&s;obedient and deceived, as now ye are: Which Light as you come into, and obeying what is made manife&s;t to you therein, you will not repent that you were kept from &s;hedding Blood, tho' it were by a Woman. It is not mine own Life I &s;eek, (for I chu&s;e rather to &s;uffer with the People of God, than to enjoy the Plea&s;ures of <HI>Egypt)</HI> but the Life of the Seed, which I know the Lord hath ble&s;&s;ed, and therefore &s;eeks the Enemy thus vehemently to de&s;troy the Life thereof, as in all Ages he ever did. O hearken not unto him, I be&s;eech you, for the Seed's-Sake, which is one in all, and is dear in the Sight of God, which they that touch, touch the Apple of his Eye, and cannot e&s;|cape his Wrath; whereof I having felt, cannot but per&s;uade all Men that I have to do withal, e&s;pecially you who name the Name of Chri&s;t, to depart from &s;uch Iniquity, as <HI>&s;hedding Blood, even of the Saints of the Mo&s;t High,</HI> Therefore let my Reque&s;t have as much Ac|ceptance with you, if you be Chri&s;tians, as <HI>E&s;ther's</HI> had with <HI>Aha&s;ue|rus,</HI> who&s;e Relation is &s;hort of That that's between Chri&s;tians; and my Reque&s;t is the &s;ame that hers was: And he &s;aid not, that he had made a Law, and that it would be di&s;honourable for him to revoke it; but when he under&s;tood that tho&s;e People were &s;o prized by her, and &s;o nearly concerned her, as in Truth the&s;e are to me, you may &s;ee what he did for her. Therefore I leave the&s;e Lines with you, appeal|ing to the faithful and true Witne&s;s of God, which is one in all Con|&s;ciences, before whom we mu&s;t all appear; with whom I &s;hall eternal|ly re&s;t, in everla&s;ting Joy and Peace, whether you will hear or for|bear. With him is my Reward, with whom to live is my Joy, and to die is my Gain, tho' I had not had your Forty eight Hours Warn|ing, for the Preparation of the Death of <HI>Mary Dyar.</HI></P>
<P>And know this al&s;o, that if thro' the Enmity you &s;hall declare your &s;elves wor&s;e than <HI>Aha&s;uerus,</HI> and confirm your Law, tho' it were but by taking away the Life of one of us, that the Lord will overthrow both your Law and you, by his righteous Judgments and Plagues poured ju&s;tly upon you, who now whil&s;t ye are warned thereof, and tenderly &s;ought unto, may avoid the one, by removing the other. If you neither hear, nor obey the Lord nor his Servants, yet will he &s;end more of his Servants among you, &s;o that your End &s;hall be fru&s;trated, that think to re&s;train them ye call <HI>cur&s;ed Quakers,</HI> from coming among you by any Thing you can do to them. Yea, verily, he hath a Seed here among you, for whom we have &s;uffered all this while, and yet &s;uffer; whom the Lord of the Harve&s;t will &s;end forth more Labourers to gather, out of the Mouths of the Devourers of all Sorts, into his Fold, where he will lead them into fre&s;h Pa&s;tures, even the

<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL the&s;e Overturnings, and almo&s;t wonderful Changings were effected thro' the Ju&s;tice of the Lord's Hand&mdash; You are now again at the Stern of Government, and on the Throne; and I dare not but &s;ay, it is of and by the Lord, and that he hath done it con|trary to the Expectations of many; and what his End is in it, remains with him. But I am &s;ure one Cau&s;e is, that you may execute Part of his Wrath upon that treacherous Generation of hypocritical and deceitful Men, &s;ome of the Army I mean.&mdash; I need not &s;ay to you, how that many of them were rai&s;ed up from a low E&s;tate; and in&s;tead of &s;erving the Nation, became their Lords and Oppre&s;&s;ors: They have abu&s;ed the Lord's Mercy to them, and exalted them&s;elves, and become as great Oppre&s;&s;ors, and as grievous to the Nation, as ever they were that went before them; and &s;ome of them took the very Titles and E&s;tates or their Enemie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and followed their evil Spi|rit al&s;o, tho' the Lord was long-&s;uffering to them, and gave them a <HI>Day,</HI> and put Opportunity into their Hands, wherein they might have done Good; but they al&s;o neglected to &s;erve God and the Nation, to &s;erve them&s;elves; and becau&s;e of the Ambition and Pride of &s;ome of them, the Lord &s;uffered them to make this la&s;t Interruption upon you, which was great <HI>Treachery</HI> in Man's Account, that thereby their Mea&s;ure might be filled up, and that he might give you Occa&s;ion again&s;t them, and &s;uffer you to be filled with Indignation towards them, to break them to Pieces: And what you do to &s;ome of them, in ca&s;ting them out, and afflicting them, you are but God's Executi|oners therein; you are the Executioners of his Anger, in what you do to them; and who &s;hall prevent you, or forbid you to go on? For they have long enough di&s;&s;embled with this Nation, in profe&s;|&s;ing more than others, and doing le&s;s; and their <HI>Downfal</HI> is now. And God hath looked upon you to be hard-hearted and cruel enough, and very fit Executioners of Vengeance upon &s;uch Men, as I have men|tioned.</P>
<P>But now concerning you, and your pre&s;ent State, as you are in pre|&s;ent Place and Power, I have &s;omething to &s;ay to you; tho they are fallen, and you yet &s;tand, and you have a little Time after them; but this I &s;ay, do not glory over their <HI>Fall,</HI> neither glory as tho' you &s;hould &s;tand for ever; for they were not greater Sinners than you are, neither are you one whit more righteous than &s;ome of them; but you are as &s;ure to fall, as they are fallen, with no le&s;s Mea&s;ure of Di&s;|honour and Affliction than is come upon them; and you are in your la&s;t Hour; and I dare not &s;ay, that God expects much more from you, than for the End afore&s;aid <HI>(viz) To be the Executioners of Justice upon Men as &s;inful as your &s;elves:</HI> So do not glory over them that are fallen; but know that your Time al&s;o is but &s;hort, and your Fall may prove to your De&s;truction, and theirs may prove to make them hotter, and refine them: And if God hath cho&s;en you to execute &s;ome Part of his Wrath upon them, for their <HI>Wickedne&s;s,</HI> he will doubtle&s;s find In&s;truments to execute his Wrath upon you, el&s;e he will do it with his own Hand; for he purpo&s;eth not to &s;pare you; for your Sins <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

as loud as any other People's and the <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> are as great under you, as under them whom you condemn.

And the Children of <HI>Zion</HI> they tru&s;t in the living God, and fear not the Terror of migh|ty Men, neither can they be afraid at the Roaring of the Sea, nor at the pre&s;ent Threatning of the Heathen; for God is with them. And I &s;ay unto you, the Servant of the Lord hath ponder'd and con&s;ider'd all the&s;e proceedings, and viewed the pre&s;ent State of Things at this Day, and there is no Vi&s;ion from God unto you of Peace and Com|fort, nor of a happy and la&s;ting Government, as you now &s;tand. If any Prophet &s;hall divine this unto you, he &s;peaks what he hath not from the Lord, but the Vi&s;ion of his own Heart, and he deceives you and him&s;elf; for you are not e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a right Founda|tion, neither are you acted by a right Spirit, which can truly govern for God; but the Spirit of Wrath and Fury is put into you, for the Work which you are called. And I know not how to warn you that you do not per&s;ecute the People of God: <HI>For why?</HI> It may be you mu&s;t fill up your Mea&s;ure of Wickedne&s;s thereby, that God may break you perpetually; yet the le&s;s will be your Judgment, if you do it not: But and if you do it, the Lord will take Occa&s;ion again&s;t you, to wound you, and you &s;hall never be healed; and as you do afflict others, &s;o and much more &s;hall it be done unto you from the Lord. Wherefore con&s;ider what I have &s;aid; for this is the Vi&s;ion of the Almighty unto you, that &s;hall not go unful&s;illed: And what you do, you mu&s;t do it quickly; for your Time is &s;hort, and your Power will God &s;ubdue; and his Kingdom and Power will he &s;peedi|ly exalt over your Heads, and make you and the Nations know, that he is God, and that all Power is with him, and that he can do what|&s;oever he will; and it is his Right alone to reign, and his Childrens Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Kingdom with him.

<P>This Letter being printed, a Copy of it was given to each Parliament-Man, before <HI>Monk,</HI> with his Army, came into <HI>London:</HI> And how &s;oon the Predictions contained therein, as well as tho&s;e of <HI>E.

In the mean while he &s;o ordered it, that many Members of the Parliament, that had been long excluded as unqualified, took Se&s;&s;ion again in that A&s;&s;embly; and the&s;e brought it about, that Sir <HI>George Booth,</HI> who was con&s;ined to the <HI>Tower,</HI> for having carried on a De&s;ign for <HI>Charles Stuart,</HI> was &s;et at Li|berty.

General <HI>Lambert</HI> was al&s;o &s;ent to the <HI>Tower,</HI> and <HI>Monk,</HI> who&s;e Authority now encrea&s;ed, &s;ent for the Lords, who until the Year 1648, had &s;ate in Parliament, and bad them return to the Hou&s;e where they formerly u&s;ed to &s;it.</P>

But the Con&s;tables and Officers of the Town came al&s;o under Pretence to look for a Je&s;uit, who&s;e Head, they &s;aid, was &s;haved. So they took off <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Hat, but not finding any bald Place on his Head, they went away with Shame. This was of good Service among the Soldiers and others, and it affected the People, who were turned to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Then he pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> where his Friends Meetings were often di&s;turbed. One Time there came a wicked Man, who having a Bear's Skin on his Back, plaid ugly Pranks in the Meeting; and &s;etting him&s;elf oppo&s;ite to the Per&s;on that was preaching, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olled his Tongue out of his Mouth, and &s;o made Sport for his wicked Followers, and cau&s;ed great Di&s;turbance in the Meeting.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A dreadful Judgment on a Scoffer.</NOTE> But as he went back from thence, an eminent Judgment overtook him; for there being a Bull-baiting in the Way, he &s;taid to &s;ee; and coming within his Reach, the Bull pu&s;h'd his Horn under the Man's Chin, into his Throat, and for|ced his Tongue out of his Mouth, &s;o that it hung out in the &s;ame Manner as before he lolled it out in Deri&s;ion in the Meeting: And the Bull running his Horn into the Man's Head, &s;wung him about in a mo&s;t fearful Manner.</P>

Whil&s;t he was in <HI>Corn|wal,</HI> there were great Shipwrecks about the Land's End. Now it was the Cu&s;tom of that Country, that at &s;uch Times both Rich and Poor went out to get as much of the Wreck as they could, not caring to &s;ave the People's Lives; and this Cu&s;tom &s;o prevailed, that in &s;ome Parts of the Country they called Shipwrecks, <HI>God's Grace.</HI> This grie|ved <HI>G. Fox</HI> not a little, con&s;idering how far the&s;e profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians were below the Heathen at <HI>Melita,</HI> who courteou&s;ly received <HI>Paul,</HI> and the others that had &s;uffered Shipwreck with him, and made him a Fire. On this Con&s;ideration, he was moved to write a Paper to the Magi&s;trates, Prie&s;ts, and others, both high and low; in which he &s;hew|ed them <Q>The Wickedne&s;s of their Deeds, and reproved them for &s;uch greedy Actions, telling them how they were ready to fight with one another for the Spoil, and &s;pend what they got in Taverns or Ale-hou&s;es, letting tho&s;e that e&s;caped drowning, go a begging up and down the Country. Therefore he &s;eriou&s;ly exhorted them, to do un|to others, what they would have done to them&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>This Paper he &s;ent to all the Pari&s;hes thereabouts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several emi|nent People in <HI>Cornwal</HI> con|vinced by <HI>G.

Fox</HI> de&s;ired them to go al&s;o to the Colonel that com|manded the Soldiers, and to acquaint him of their rude Carriage, and how they di&s;turbed the Meetings. But the afore&s;aid four Per&s;ons were backward to go to him. Next Morning being the fir&s;t Day of the Week, a Meeting was kept in an Orchard, where many People came; and after <HI>G. Fox</HI> had been preaching a pretty while, there came &s;everal rude Soldiers, &s;ome with drawn Swords, and &s;ome drunk, and among the&s;e one that had bound him&s;elf with an Oath, <HI>To cut down, and kill the Man that &s;poke.</HI> But when he came pre&s;&s;ing in thro' the Crowd, and was within two Yards of <HI>G. Fox,</HI> he &s;topp'd at tho&s;e four Per&s;ons before mentioned, and fell a jangling with them; but at length his Sword was put up again. The next Day they went and &s;poke with the Colonel; and he having heard how mi&s;chievous his Soldiers had been, &s;ent for them, and cut and &s;la&s;h'd &s;ome of them. When this was told <HI>G. Fox,</HI> he blamed tho&s;e his Friends, thinking they might have prevented the cutting of the Soldiers, if they had gone to the Colonel when he would have had them. Yet this had &s;uch Effect, that the Meeting there was kept without Di&s;turbance a good while after.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> then al&s;o had a general Meeting at <HI>Edward Pyot</HI>'s near <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> at which were &s;everal Thou&s;ands of People, and &s;o many of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> that &s;ome &s;aid, <HI>The City look'd naked:</HI> And all was quiet.</P>
<P>But in other Places about this Time Things were not &s;o quiet; for the Soldiers under General <HI>Monk</HI>'s Command, were often very rude in di&s;turbing of Meetings.

<P>Now the King, who by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> was invited to return to <HI>Bru&s;|&s;els,</HI> and by the <HI>French</HI> to come to <HI>Calais,</HI> cho&s;e, at the pre&s;&s;ing Invita|tion of the States General of the United Provinces to go by <HI>Holland;</HI> and &s;o he went with the Yachts of the States to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and from thence with Coaches to the <HI>Hague,</HI> where having &s;taid &s;ome Days, he took Shipping at <HI>Schevelighen</HI> for <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And from <HI>Holland</HI> ar|rives in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and comes to <HI>Lon|don</HI> on the Anniversary of his Birth|day.</NOTE> and made his Entry at <HI>London</HI> on the Anniver&s;ary of his Birth-Day. Thus we &s;ee <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, who not long after was crown'd, re&s;tored not by the Sword, but by the marvellous Hand of the Lord.</P>
<P>About this Time <HI>George Fox</HI> the Younger came to <HI>Harwich,</HI> where he was haled out of a Meeting, and impri&s;oned under a Pretence of having cau&s;ed a Tumult. But to give to the Reader a true Sight of the Mat|ter, I mu&s;t go back a little.</P>
<P>About four Years before this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Story at large of <HI>G.F.</HI> jun. being im|pri&s;oned at <HI>Harwich</HI> on pretence of a tumult.</NOTE> &s;ome of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> being come into the &s;aid Town, one of them &s;poke a few Words by way of Exhortation to the People that came from the Steeple-hou&s;e; and pa&s;&s;ing on, he and tho&s;e with him went to an Inn. The Mayor hearing thereof, &s;ent to them, commanding that they &s;hould depart the Town, which they did after a &s;hort Space; but about Night they re|turned and lodg'd as their Inn; and the next Day pa&s;&s;ed away peace|ably. Not long after, the Woman that kept the Inn, was commanded to come before the Magi&s;trates, who threatned to take away her Li|cence, unle&s;s &s;he promi&s;ed to lodge no more &s;uch Per&s;ons. But how eager &s;oever they were for keeping out the <HI>Quakers,</HI> yet it proved ineffectual; for it &s;eems &s;ome of tho&s;e that had been &s;poken to in the Streets, were &s;o reached, that they came to be obedient to the inward Teachings of the Lord they had been recommended to. And &s;o a Way was made for Meetings there, whereby the Number of tho&s;e of that Society began to increa&s;e. And becau&s;e they could no longer comply with &s;uper&s;titious Burials, they bought a Piece of Ground to bury their Dead in, but met with great Oppo&s;ition at their Burials; and once, when &s;everal came along to bury a Corps, it was by Force taken from them, and &s;et by the Sea-&s;ide, where having lain above Ground Part of two Days and one Night, it was privately covered by &s;ome with &s;mall Stones.</P>
<P>In the Month called <HI>May, G. Fox</HI> the Younger came to <HI>Harwich,</HI> to preach the Truth there. The Mayor of the Town, who&s;e Name was <HI>Miles Hubbard,</HI> having heard of this, &s;topt &s;everal that were going to the Meeting. The rude Multitude &s;eeing it, grew in&s;olent, and made a hideous Noi&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">fore the Hou&s;e where the Meeting was kept, and &s;ome were for pulling it down. <HI>G.

The Officers then coming, the Mayor commanded the Con&s;tables to take the &s;aid <HI>G.

<P>By this it appeared that the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Harwich</HI> had &s;pecial Friends in the Parliament. <HI>R. Gra&s;&s;ingham</HI> being at Liberty, was gone to <HI>London;</HI> and when this Order came to <HI>Harwich, G.

But they thought it to be unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable, that only one &s;hould be haled out of a peaceable Meeting, and &s;ent to Pri&s;on, without being examined, only for declaring again&s;t the cur|&s;ing and the Wickedne&s;s of the rude People, and again&s;t &s;uch as &s;uf|fered &s;uch Ungodline&s;s, and did not &s;eek to &s;uppre&s;s it.</Q></P>

<P>Shortly after this Order was i&s;&s;ued forth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who are yet a good while de|tained for their Fees.</NOTE> the Sergeant at Arms &s;ent his Clerk to demand Fees and Chamber-Rent of the Pri&s;oners, asking fifty Pounds for Fees, and ten Shillings a Week for Chamber-Rent. But &s;ince no Evil was laid to their Charge, they could not re&s;olve to &s;atisfy this unrea&s;onable Demand, yet offered to pay two Shillings and Sixpence a Week, tho' the Chamber where they had lain, was the highe&s;t Room in a lofty Tower, and all the Windows open, until they had gotten them glazed, without any Charge to the Sergeant. Mat|ters &s;tanding thus, their Cau&s;e was referred to the King's Privy Coun|cil. But it la&s;ted yet a good while before they were relea&s;ed; for &s;everal Eva&s;ions were made u&s;e of to keep them in Cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t <HI>G. Fox</HI> was Pri&s;oner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Memorable Exhortations to K.<HI>Ch II.</HI> by <HI>G. F.</HI></NOTE> he wrote a little Book, which he call'd <HI>A Noble Salutation to King</HI> Charles Stuart. Wherein he &s;hewed him how Matters had gone in <HI>England,</HI> viz. <Q>That his Father's Party &s;corn|ed tho&s;e that appeared in Arms again&s;t them becau&s;e of their Mean|ne&s;s for they were Trade&s;men, Ploughmen, Servants, and the like; which contemptible In&s;truments God made u&s;e of to bring down the Loftine&s;s of the others. But tho&s;e of the Parliament Party growing from Time to Time &s;ucce&s;sful and prevailing, got into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e they conquered, and fell into the &s;ame Pride and Oppre&s;&s;ion which they had cried out again&s;t in others; and many of them be|came greater Oppre&s;&s;ors and Per&s;ecutors than the former had been.</Q> Moreover, the Author exhorted the King to ob&s;reve the Hand of the Lord in re&s;toring of him. <HI>Therefore,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>let no Man deceive thee, by per&s;uading thee that the&s;e Things are thus brought to pa&s;s, becau&s;e the
<PB N="240" REF="003104_0251_0FEFF5A5AC6E0218">
Kingdom was thy own proper Right, and becau&s;e it was witheld from thee con|trary to all Right; or becau&s;e that tho&s;e called Royali&s;ts are much more righteous than tho&s;e who are now fallen under Thee. For I plainly declare unto Thee, that this Kingdom, and all the Kingdoms of the Earth are properly the Lord's.&mdash;And this know, that it was the ju&s;t Hand of God, in taking away tha Kingdom from thy Father and thee, and giving it unto others; and that al&s;o it is the ju&s;t Hand of the Lord to take it again from them, and bring them under Thee; tho' I &s;hall not &s;ay, but that &s;ome of them went beyond their Commi&s;&s;ion again&s;t thy Father, when they were brought as a Rod over you; and well will it be for Thee, if Thou become&s;t not guilty of the &s;ame Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>The Author farther exhorts the King to con&s;ider,<Q>That his Station was not without Danger; becau&s;e of the Changeablene&s;s of the Peo|ple, a great Part of which were perfidious, &s;ince one while they had &s;worn for a King and Parliament; and &s;hortly after they &s;wore again&s;t a King, &s;ingle Per&s;on, or Hou&s;e of Lords; and afterwards again they &s;wore for a &s;ingle Per&s;on. Some Time after, they cry'd up a Parlia|ment again. And when <HI>0. Cromwel</HI> had turn d out the Parliament, and &s;et up him&s;elf, then the Prie&s;ts prayed for him, and a&s;&s;erted his Au|thority to be ju&s;t; and when he died, they fawned upon his Son <HI>Richard,</HI> and bla&s;phemou&s;ly termed his Father <HI>the Light of their Eyes, and the Breath of their No&s;trils;</HI> and they told him,<HI>that God had left him to carry on that glorious Work which his Father had begun.</HI> Nay, &s;ome Prie&s;ts compared <HI>Oliver</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> to <HI>Jo&s;hua, who &s;hould carry them into the promi&s;ed Land.</HI> Thus they continually would flatter tho&s;e that were at the Helm. For when <HI>George Booth</HI> made a Ri&s;ing, and they thought there would be a Turn, then &s;ome of the Prie&s;ts cryed out again&s;t the Parliament, and cur&s;ed &s;uch as would not go out again&s;t them. But when <HI>Booth</HI> was taken, then many began to petition the Parliament, and to excu&s;e them&s;elves, that they had no Hand in that Ri&s;ing.</Q></P>
<P>Next the Author &s;ets forth the Wickedne&s;s of the People, <Q>by ex|ce&s;&s;ive Drinking, and Drunkenne&s;s; thereby, as it were, to &s;hew their Loyalty to the King: And he relates al&s;o, how having preached at <HI>Harwich,</HI> again&s;t the grievous Wickedne&s;s of the People, he was haled to Pri&s;on in the King's Name. Finally he exhorts the King to take Heed of &s;eeking Revenge; and to &s;hew Mercy.</Q></P>
<P>This Paper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which were delivered to the King by <HI>R. H.</HI> and afterward printed. Divers Que|ries propo&s;ed to the Qua|kers, &s;uppo|&s;edly by the <HI>E.</HI> of <HI>C.</HI></NOTE> which was not a &s;mall one, for it took up &s;everal Sheets, was delivered in Writing by <HI>Richard Hubberthorn,</HI> into the King's Hand at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and was not long after by the Author given forth in Print.</P>
<P>Now one of the mo&s;t eminent Royali&s;ts drew up divers Queries to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> de&s;iring them to an&s;wer to them, and to direct their An|&s;wer with this Super&s;cription, <HI>Tradite hanc Amico Regis,</HI> that is, <HI>Deliver this to the King's Friend.</HI> For it was clearly &s;een, that &s;everal of their Predictions came to be fulfilled, of which tho&s;e of <HI>Edward Burroughs</HI> were not the lea&s;t. And therefore &s;ome (as it &s;eems) thought that by the <HI>Quakers</HI> they might get &s;ome Knowledge whether any Stability of the King's Government was to be expected. By the Queries it appeared, that the Author of them was a Man of Under&s;tanding, and of &s;ome Moderation al&s;o; and tho' I don't know who he was, yet I am not with|out Thoughts that <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> and High Chancellor, may have been the Penman thereof. The Tendency of the&s;e Queries chiefly was to know from the <HI>Quakers,</HI> <Q>What their Judgment was concerning the King's Right to the Crown; and whether they ever did fore&s;ee his Return; and al&s;o whether they could judge that his Reign or Government &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed or not. Moreover, whether he might ju&s;tly forgive or avenge him&s;elf? And whether he might allow Liber|ty of Con&s;cience to all Sorts of People,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An&s;wered by</HI> E.

the&s;e Queries, and publi&s;hed his An&s;wer in Print. It was directed to the King and the Royali&s;ts. In it he &s;hewed, <Q>That in &s;ome of their Writings it had been &s;ignified, that they had &s;ome Expectations of the King's Re&s;toration. That the King's coming to the Throne was rea&s;onable and equitable, becau&s;e thro' the Purpo&s;e of the Lord. That his Reign and Government might be ble&s;&s;ed, or not ble&s;&s;ed, according to his Carriage. And that he might ju&s;tly forgive his and his Fa|ther's Enemies; for tho' he and his Father might have been injured; yet fora&s;much as they had applyed to the Sword to determine their Controver&s;y with the Nation, the Sword went again&s;t them; and by that whereby they thought to &s;tand, they did fall; and who then &s;hould they blame for that which befel them, &s;eeing the Sword which they them&s;elves did chu&s;e, de&s;troyed them. However the Author &s;ignified, that this was not meant of the King's Death, that being quite another Ca&s;e. And if &s;uch, who had de&s;troyed Kingly Go|vernment in Name and Title, and pretended to govern better, and did not make Reformation, but became Oppre&s;&s;ors, having broke their Promi&s;es, came to be puni&s;hed on that Account with Death, or other|wi&s;e, &s;uch could not be &s;aid to &s;uffer for a good Con&s;cience, nor for Righteou&s;ne&s;s Sake; but it was becau&s;e they were Oppre&s;&s;ors; and &s;uffering for that Cau&s;e could not be called Per&s;ecution.</Q> <HI>But none of us</HI> (thus ran <HI>Edward Burroughs</HI>'s Words) <HI>can &s;uffer for that Cau&s;e, as not being guilty thereof. If we &s;uffer in your Government, it is for the Name of Chri&s;t, becau&s;e nothing can be charged again&s;t us in this Capacity as we now &s;tand, and in this State unto which we are now gathered and changed, nor in any Matter of Action or Rebellion again&s;t the King, nor his Father; nor in any Thing concerning the Law and Wor&s;hip of our God, and the Matters of his King|dom, and our pure Con&s;ciences. And if any that are now among&s;t us, were any Way engaged in the Parliament Service in the Wars, it was not in Rebellion a|gain&s;t the King or his Father, or that we &s;ought their De&s;truction, as Men; but upon &s;ober and rea&s;onable Principles, and not for corrupt Ends, nor to get Ho|nour and Riches to our &s;elves, as &s;ome others might do, who went into the War for &s;elf Ends, and continued in Action, after the Cau&s;e which was once engaged for was utterly lo&s;t. And that Principle, which &s;ome Time led &s;ome into Action to oppo&s;e Oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;eek after Reformation, that Principle is &s;till ju&s;tified, tho' we are now better informed than once we were. For tho' we do now more than ever oppo&s;e Oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;eek after Reformation, yet we do it not in that Way of outward warring and fighting with carnal Weapons and Swords; and you ought to put a Difference between &s;uch as &s;ome Time acted in the Wars again&s;t you, in and upon &s;ober and rea&s;onable Principles, and that did not make them&s;elves rich and high in the World, thro' your Sufferings, and between &s;uch as have acted again&s;t you for Sef-Ends, and have in&s;ulted over you, and have made them&s;elves great and rich in this World thro' your Afflictions and Sufferings.</HI> To the Query, <Q>Whether the great Afflictions &s;u&s;tained by the King divers Years, from Subjects of his own Nation, and the Guilt thereof, did lie upon all the Subjects in general? Or whether upon any, or &s;ome particu|lar Sorts of People, who were &s;uch more than others?</Q> <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> made this An&s;wer, <HI>So far as his Sufferings were unju&s;t, the Guilt thereof doth not lie upon all the Subjects in general, but upon &s;ome more than others; and &s;uch are ea&s;y to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from others, if it be con&s;idered who they are that rai&s;ed the War in this Nation, again&s;t the King, and who fir&s;t preached and prayed up the War, and pro&s;ecuted it again&s;t the King's Father, and who ca&s;t out the Bi|&s;hops and Prelates from their Places, and took their Revenues and Benefices, and are become Men as corrupted, as covetous and &s;elf-&s;eeking, as proud and ambitious, as unju&s;t Per&s;ecutors, as even the Men were which they ca&s;t out: And who it is that hath gotten great E&s;tates in the Nation, and worldly Honour, and rai&s;ed them&s;elves from nothing by the Wars, and by your Suffering; and

At <HI>York,</HI> about thirty Miles off, No|tice being given of this Meeting, a Troop of Hor&s;e came from thence; and when <HI>G.

G.

Fox</HI> ask'd him, <Q>What Honour it would be to him to ride with Swords and Pi&s;tols among&s;t &s;o many unarmed Men and Women; But if he would be &s;till and quiet, the Meeting probably might not continue above two or three Hours: And when it was done, as they came peaceably, &s;o they &s;hould part: For he might perceive, the Meeting was &s;o large, that all the Country thereabouts could not entertain them, but that they intended to de|part towards their Homes at Night.</Q> But the Captain &s;aid, <HI>He could, not &s;tay &s;o long.

<P>THou came&s;t not into this Nation by Sword, nor by Victory of War; but by the Power of the Lord: Now if thou do&s;t not live in it, thou wilt not pro&s;per. And if the Lord hath &s;hewed thee Mercy, and forgiven thee, and thou do&s;t not &s;hew Mercy, and forgive, the Lord God will not hear thy Prayers, not them that pray for thee: And if thou do not &s;top Per&s;ecution, and Per&s;ecutors, and take away all Laws that do hold up Per&s;ecution about Religion; but if thou do per&s;i&s;t in them, and uphold Per&s;ecution, that will make thee as blind as them that have gone before thee: For Per&s;e|cution hath always blinded tho&s;e that have gone into it; and &s;uch, God by his Power overthrows, and doth his valiant Acts upon, and bringeth Salvation to his oppre&s;&s;ed ones: And if thou do&s;t bear the Sword in vain, and let Drunkenne&s;s, Oaths, Plays, May-games, (with Fidlers, Drums, Trumpets to play at them) with &s;uch like Abominations and Vanities be encouraged, or go unpuni&s;hed; as &s;et|ting up of May-poles, with the Image of the Crown a top of them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Nations will quickly turn like <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> and be as bad as the old World, who grieved the Lord till he overthrew them: And &s;o he will you, if the&s;e Things be not &s;uddenly prevented. Hardly was there &s;o much Wickedne&s;s at Liberty before now, as there is now at this Day; as tho' there was no Terror, nor Sword of Magi&s;tracy; which doth not grace a Government, nor is a Prai&s;e to them that do well. Our Prayers are for them that are in Au|thority, that under them we may live a godly Life, in which we have Peace; and that we may not be brought into Ungodline&s;s by them. So hear, and con&s;ider, and do good in thy Time, whil&s;t thou ha&s;t Power; and be merciful, and forgive, that is the Way to overcome, and obtain the Kingdom of Chri&s;t.</P>

<P>Since the Lord hath called us, and gathered us to be a People, to walk in his Fear, and in his Truth, we have always &s;uffered and been per&s;ecutcd by the Powers that have ruled, and been made a Prey of, for departing from Iniquity; and when the Breach of no ju&s;t Law could be charged aguin&s;t us, then they made Laws on Purpo&s;e to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;nare us; and &s;o our Sufferings were unju&s;tly continued.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>R. H.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>And likewi&s;e the &s;ame Sufferings do now abound in more Cruelty again&s;t us in many Parts of this Nation: As for In&s;tance, one at <HI>Thetford</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> where <HI>Henry Fell,</HI> mini&s;tring unto the Peo|ple, was taken out of the Meeting, and whipp'd, and &s;ent out of the Town, from Pari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to Pari&s;h, towards <HI>Lanca&s;hire;</HI> and the chief Ground of his Accu&s;ation in his Pa&s;s (which was &s;hewn to the King) was becau&s;e he denied to take the Oath of Allegiance and Su|premacy; and &s;o becau&s;e that for Con&s;cience-&s;ake we cannot &s;wear, but have learned Obedience to the Doctrine of Chri&s;t, which &s;aith, <HI>Swear not at all;</HI> hereby an Occa&s;ion is taken again&s;t us, to per&s;ecute us; and it is well known, that we have not &s;worn for any, nor again&s;t any, but have kept to the Truth, and our Yea hath been Yea, and our Nay, Nay, in all Things, which is more than the Oath or tho&s;e that are out of the Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King. </SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But why can you not &s;wear? for an Oath is a common Thing among&s;t Men to any Engagement.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER><HI>R. H.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>Yes it is manife&s;t, and we have &s;een it by Experience; and it is &s;o common among&s;t Men to &s;wear and engage either for, or again&s;t Things, that there is no Regard taken to them, nor Fear of an Oath; that therefore which we &s;peak of in the Truth of our Hearts, is more than what they &s;wear.</P>

<P>Yes, what we do affirm, we can promi&s;e before the Lord, and take him to our Witne&s;s in it; but our &s;o promi&s;ing hath not been accepted, but the Ceremony of an Oath they have &s;tood for, without which all other Things were accounted of no Effect.</P>

<P>Our Principle is this, That <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the true Light which enlightneth every one that cometh into the World, that all Men thro' him might believe;</HI> and that they were to obey and follow this Light, as they have received it, whereby they may be led unto God, and unto Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the Knowledge of the Truth, that they may be &s;aved.</P>

<P>There is Difference between that Bread which he brake at his la&s;t Supper, wherein they were to &s;hew forth, as in a Sign, his Death until he came; and this whereof they &s;pake, they being ma|ny, are one Bread; for herein they were come more into the Sub|&s;tance, and to &s;peak more my&s;tically, as they knew it in the Spirit.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>This we know, becau&s;e the Spirit of Truth it reproves the World of Sin, and by it we were reproved of Sin, and al&s;o are led from Sin unto Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Obedience of Truth, by which Ef|fects we know it is the true Spirit; for the Spirit of the wicked One doth not lead into &s;uch Things.</P>

Many of the late King's Judges were now hanged and quartered: Among tho&s;e was al&s;o Colonel <HI>Fran|cis Hacker,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. <HI>Hacker</HI> is executed for Trea&s;on: A little before his Death he owns Trouble for what he had done to the Innocent.</NOTE> of whom about &s;ix Years before this Time, it hath been &s;aid, that he took <HI>George Fox</HI> Pri&s;oner.

To all which and more, he &s;aid little, but that what he did, was by Order of his Superiors; and that he had endeavoured to &s;erve his Country. But this did not a|vail him, for he was condemned for high Trea&s;on, and hang'd and quartered in <HI>October.</HI> A Day or two before his Death, <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> vi&s;ited him in Pri&s;on; and when he was put in Mind of what former|ly he had done again&s;t the Innocent, he remembered it, and &s;aid, <HI>He knew well whom &s;he meant, and had Trouble upon him for it.</HI> For <HI>G.

Early in the Morning there came a Company of Foot to the Hou&s;e; and one of them drawing his Sword, held it over <HI>G.

As he was going out, he &s;aw &s;everal of his Friends going to the Meeting, it being then the fir&s;t Day of the Week; and he intended to have gone thither him&s;elf, if he had not been &s;topp'd; but now it being out of his Power to keep them Company, he commended their Boldne&s;s, and encouraged them to per|&s;evere therein. When he was come to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> &s;eeing the Soldiers and People were exceeding rude, he began to exhort them to Godli|ne&s;s.

<P>This Per&s;ecution going on throughout the Nation, <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> went to the King, and gave him an Account how her Friends, that were no wi&s;e concerned in the &s;aid In&s;urrection and Riots, were treated; for &s;everal Thou&s;ands of them were ca&s;t into Pri&s;on. The King and Coun|cil wondred how they could have &s;uch Intelligence, &s;ince &s;trict Charge was given for the Intercepting of all Letters, &s;o that none could pa&s;s un&s;earched. But notwith&s;tanding this, &s;o much was heard of the Numbers of the Impri&s;oned, that <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> went a &s;econd Time to the King and Council, and acquainted them of the grievous Sufferings of Her Friends. <HI>G. Fox</HI> then writ a Letter of Con&s;olation to his Suf|fering Friends; and al&s;o publi&s;hed in print a Declaration again&s;t all Sedition, Plotters and Fighters, wherein he manife&s;ted, that they were an harmle&s;s People, that denied Wars and Fightings, and could not make u&s;e of the outward Sword, or other carnal Weapons. This Declaration was pre&s;ented to the King and his Council and was of &s;uch Effect, that the King gave forth a Proclamation, <HI>That no Soldiers &s;hould go to &s;earch any Hou&s;e but with a Con&s;table.</HI> When afterwards &s;ome of the Fifth Monarchy-men were put to Death becau&s;e of their In&s;ur|rection, they did the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, that Right, that they clear'd them openly from having an Hand in, or Knowledge of their Plot. This and other Evidences cau&s;ed the King, being continually impor|tuned thereunto, to i&s;&s;ue forth a Declaration, <HI>That the</HI> Quakers <HI>&s;hould be &s;et at Liberty without paying Fees.</HI> Many of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Preachers now temporized, and for keeping their Benefices, join'd with the Epi&s;copalians; and did not &s;tick to put on the Surplice. But this gave Occa&s;ion to many of their Hearers to leave them, and join with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, who could not comply with the Times. Others, who were a little more &s;tedfa&s;t, made u&s;e of their Money to get Li|berty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Others pur|cha&s;e their Li|berty, who in <HI>Oliver</HI>'s time would permit none.</NOTE> tho' under the Government of <HI>Cromwel</HI> they would permit no Liberty of Con&s;cience to others; in&s;omuch that one <HI>Hewes,</HI> an emi|nent Prie&s;t at <HI>Plymouth in Oliver</HI>'s Days, when &s;ome Liberty was granted, pray'd <HI>That God would put it into the Hearts of the chief Magi&s;trates of the Nation, to remove this cur&s;ed Toleration.</HI> But this <HI>Hewes,</HI> after the King was come in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And one <HI>Hewes</HI> who before had called Tolera|tion cur&s;ed, knew not what to &s;ay now.</NOTE> being ask'd by one, <HI>Whether he would account Toleration ac|cur&s;ed now,</HI> an&s;wered only by the Shaking of his Head.</P>
<P>Now tho' many of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as hath been &s;aid, were relea&s;ed from Pri&s;on, yet they &s;uffer'd exceedingly in their Religious A&s;&s;em|blies. Once a Company of <HI>Iri&s;hmen</HI> came to the <HI>Pall-Mall,</HI> when <HI>G. Fox</HI>
<PB N="255" REF="003104_0266_0FEFF57400E45CF0">
was there; but the Meeting was already broke up; and he being gone up into a Chamber, heard one of tho&s;e rude Per&s;ons, who was a Co|lonel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At <HI>Pall Mall</HI> a de&s;perate <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Colonel calm'd by <HI>G.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding &s;uch like rude Encounters, yet by the Change of the Government, &s;ome Stop was put to the fierce Current of Per&s;ecu|tion; for the King being but newly &s;ettled on the Throne, &s;hewed yet an Inclination to Lenity. But this Quiet did not la&s;t long, and was but a Time of Re&s;piration: For the Churchmen in&s;tigated (as it &s;eems very probable) by the Favourers of Popery, continued envious, and &s;taid but for an Opportunity to &s;hew their Malice. An In&s;tance of which hath been &s;een already on the In&s;urrection of the Fifth-Monar|chy-Men, and in the Sequel will be &s;een much clearer: &s;ince tho' they did not &s;eem to per&s;ecute for Con&s;cience-&s;ake, yet under a Colour of Ju&s;tice, Laws were made u&s;e of, that had formerly been enacted for the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Popery, and to &s;ecure the Kingdom again&s;t Je&s;uits, and other traiterous Papi&s;ts; the&s;e being the Laws, of which <HI>G. Fox</HI> in his Letter to the King, had &s;aid, that <HI>they held up Per&s;ecution about Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Now that it may be known what Laws tho&s;e were, and that it may al&s;o appear what an unrea&s;onable U&s;e hath been made thereof, I &s;hall here &s;et them down, or Ab&s;tracts of them; that &s;o it may be more plainly &s;een, what aukward Means have been made u&s;e of, and how fi|ni&s;trou&s;ly the Laws were executed. Sometimes I may interweave a|mong the&s;e Ab&s;tracts &s;ome Ob&s;ervations, or an Account of a Ca&s;e, which, tho' not placed in due Time, may yet be &s;erviceable to give a true Notion of Things. I now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">epair to tho&s;e Laws.</P>
<P>In the 27th Year of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, a Law was made for Pay|ment of Tithes: For that King having either given or &s;old many Chappels and Abbies to Laymen, tho&s;e Laymen had no Right, as Prie&s;ts claimed to have, to &s;ummon to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts tho&s;e that failed in paying of Tithes. But for this a Law was provide, by Virtue of which a Judge of an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court might be helpful to Laymen, and in that Law it was &s;aid,
<Q>If the Judge of an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court make Complaint to two Ju&s;tices of Peace <HI>(Quorum unus)</HI> of any Contumacy or Mi&s;demeanour committed by a Defen|dant in any Suit there depending for Tithes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27 Hen. 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cap. 20.</NOTE> the &s;aid Ju&s;tices &s;hall commit &s;uch Defendant to Pri&s;on, there to remain till he &s;hall find &s;ufficient Surety to be bound before them by Recognizance, or otherwi&s;e to give due Obedience to the Proce&s;s, Proceedings, Decrees and Sentences of the &s;aid Court.</Q></P>
<P>By this Law (which is pretended to be &s;till in Force) many hone&s;t People have &s;uffered, and been kept very long in Pri&s;on: For they re|fu&s;ing to find Surety for the Payment of Tithes, which for Con&s;cience-&s;ake they could not give to &s;uch Mini&s;ters who lived from a forced Maintenance, and did not (as they judged) profit the People; it was in
<PB N="256" REF="003104_0267_0FEFF5B8518FCDC8">
the Power of the Prie&s;ts to detain them Pri&s;oners till the pretended Debt was paid; which the Per&s;ecuted judged &s;o unrea&s;onable, that &s;ome have therefore continued in Pri&s;on for many Years, chu&s;ing rather to die in Goal, than to uphold &s;uch Preachers by paying Tithes to them. And the <HI>Quakers</HI> &s;o called have never offered Re&s;i&s;tance, but Suffering and Forbearance have always been their Arms, tho' they were almo&s;t continually vexed with Laws that were never made again&s;t them; and more e&s;pecially were they mole&s;ted with the Oath of Supremacy, which was made in the Beginning of the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> tho' (it may be) projected in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, which runs thus:

<P>In the fir&s;t Year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> an Act was made for Unifor|mity of Common Prayer and Church-Service, having this Clau&s;e.
<Q>Every Per&s;on &s;hall re&s;ort to their Pari&s;h-Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE> or upon Let thereof, to &s;ome other, every Sunday and Holiday, upon Pain to be puni&s;hed by Cen&s;ures of the Church, and al&s;o to forfeit twelve Pence, to be levied by the Churchwardens there, for the &V;&s;e of the Poor, upon the Offender's Goods by Way of Di&s;tre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Here is to be noted, that &s;ome have pro&s;ecuted the pretended Of|fenders on this Clau&s;e to obviate greater Severities; altho' this Law was made becau&s;e of the Papi&s;ts, thereby to force them to come to Church; for about that Time there were not &s;o many Prote&s;tant Di&s;|&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> as afterwards; but the&s;e appearing in Time, were as well under the La&s;h of this Law, as the Papi&s;ts; for their religious A&s;&s;emblies were not reckoned to be Churches, as the Steeple-hou&s;es by a Metonymy generally have been called, at the &s;ame Rate as the <HI>Jews</HI> Meeting-hou&s;es have been called <HI>Synagogues,</HI> tho' the Word it &s;elf properly &s;ignifies the A&s;&s;embly of the People.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince the afore&s;aid Law was was not &s;trictly obeyed, not only by Papi&s;ts, but al&s;o by others, who aiming at a further Reformation, could not longer comply with the Rites of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in the 23d Year of <HI>Elizabeth</HI> a more &s;evere Law was made, with this Clau&s;e.
<Q>Every Per&s;on not repairing to Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23 Eliz. c. 2.</NOTE> according to the Statute of 1 <HI>Eliz.</HI> 2. &s;hall forfeit twenty Pounds for every Month they &s;o make Default; and if they &s;o forbear by the &s;pace of twelve Months, after Certificate thereof made by the Ordi|nary to the Kings Bench, a Ju&s;tice of A&s;&s;ize, Goal-Delivery, or Peace of the County where they dwell, &s;hall bind them with two &s;ufficient Sureties in 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> at lea&s;t, to the good Behaviour, from which they &s;hall not be relea&s;ed, until they &s;hall repair to Church according to the &s;aid Statute.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="003104_0268_0FEFF57867E5CA78">This Law it &s;eems was thought not &s;evere enough; therefore in the 29th Year of the &s;aid Queen, another Law was made with this Clau&s;e;
<Q>The Queen may &s;eize all the Goods and two third Parts of the Lands and Lea&s;es of every Offender not repairing to Church as afore&s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26 Eliz. c. 6.</NOTE> in &s;uch of the Terms of <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> as &s;hall happen next after &s;uch Conviction, for the Sum then due for the Forfeiture of twenty Pounds a Month, and yearly after that (in the &s;ame Terms) according to the Rate of twenty Pounds a Month, for &s;o long Time as they &s;hall forbear to come to Church according to the &s;aid Statute of 23 <HI>Eliz.</HI> 1.</Q></P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Acts many were pro&s;ecuted; but in the Height of this Proceeding <HI>George Whitehead, Gilbert Latey,</HI> and others, &s;ollicited King <HI>Charles</HI> the IId in the Behalf of their Friends; which had &s;uch Effect, that the King ordered Stay of Proce&s;s in divers Counties; yet after|wards the Per&s;ecution was continued till after his Death, both as to Impri&s;onment as well as &s;eizing of Goods: And other old Laws were al&s;o made u&s;e of: For in the 35th Year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, when the Papi&s;ts &s;ometimes were forming Plots again&s;t the Queen, an Act was made, containing the Effect of this Clau&s;e.</P>
<Q><P>If any of above &s;ixteen Years of Age &s;hall be convicted to have ab&s;ented them&s;elves above a Month from Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">35 Eliz. c. 1.</NOTE> without any lawful Cau&s;e, impugned the Queen's Authority in Cau&s;es Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, or frequented Conventicles, or per|&s;uaded others &s;o to do, under Pretence of Exerci&s;e of Religion, they &s;hall be com|mitted to Pri&s;on, and there remain until they &s;hall conform them&s;elves, and make &s;uch open Submi&s;&s;ion as hereafter &s;hall be pre&s;cribed: And if within three Months after &s;uch Conviction they refu&s;e to conform, and &s;ubmit them&s;elves, be|ing thereunto required by a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, they &s;hall in open A&s;&s;ize or Se&s;|&s;ions abjure the Realm: And if &s;uch Abjuration happen to be before Ju&s;tices of the Peace in Se&s;&s;ions, they &s;hall make Certificate thereof at the next A&s;&s;ize or Goal Delivery.</P>
<P><HI>And,</HI> If &s;uch an Offender refu&s;e to abjure, or going away accordingly, doth re|turn without the Queen's Licence, he &s;hall be adjudged a Felon, and &s;hall not en|joy the Benefit of Clergy; but if before he be required to abjure, he makes his Submi&s;&s;ion, the Penalties afore&s;aid &s;hall not be inflicted upon him.</P></Q>
<P>Tho' it may be &s;uppo&s;ed this Act was made chiefly again&s;t Papi&s;ts, yet &s;ome few of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, have been pro&s;ecuted there|upon, which was for their Lives; for if they had been willing to de|part the Realm, yet &s;uch, who for Con&s;cience-&s;ake could not &s;wear at all, could not oblige them&s;elves by Oath that they would do &s;o. And this being very well known, it once happened that one <HI>William A|lexander</HI> of <HI>Needham</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W.Alexan|der</HI> &amp;c. in|dicted on this Act, thro' the favourable Advice of the Judge are di&s;charged.</NOTE> being with &s;everal more indicted upon this Act, was ask'd, <HI>Guilty or not Guilty.</HI> He not being ha&s;ty to an&s;wer, the Judge &s;aid, <HI>Why don't you plead Guilty or not Guilty?</HI> To which <HI>A|lexander</HI> reply'd, <HI>What would'&s;t thou advi&s;e us to plead?</HI> The Judge, (who &s;ometimes u&s;ed to be &s;evere enough) &s;aid, <HI>Do you ask my Advice?

Then,</HI> returned the Judge, <HI>You &s;hall have it; and I'll advi&s;e you to plead Not Guilty.</HI> So the Pri&s;oners accordingly pleaded <HI>Not guilty.</HI> Then &s;aid the Judge to the Pro&s;ecutors, <HI>Now you mu&s;t prove the&s;e Men, neither to have been at their own Pari&s;h Church, nor at any other Church or Chappel, el&s;e they are not within this Act, which is a &s;anguinary Law.</HI> Thus the Judge carried or his Di&s;cour&s;e to a Di&s;charge of <HI>Alexander</HI> and his Friends from that &s;evere Indictment: For the Pro&s;ecutors were not able to prove this with Evidence, as the Law required.

<P>DEarly and well-beloved Brethren, in the heavenly Relation, and ble&s;&s;ed immortal Birth, of which we are born mo&s;t dearly in our Father's Love; my Salutation extendeth unto you all, as one with you perfectly in Sufferings and in Rejoicings, in Faith and Pa|tience, and even in all Things which you do and &s;uffer for the Name of the Lord our God; and my S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul greets you, and embraces you, and fervently wi&s;hes Peace, Love, and Unity, and the Increa&s;e of every good Gift unto you all; for I am perfectly one with you; if you receive of our Father's Fulne&s;s, I am refre&s;hed; and if you re|joice, I am glad; and if you &s;uffer, and be in Heavine&s;s, I freely par|take with you; what&s;oever is yours, whether Liberty or Bonds, whe|ther Life or Death, I partake of the &s;ame; and what&s;oever I enjoy, the &s;ame al&s;o is yours; we are of one Birth, of one Seed, of one Line, even of the Generation of him who is without Beginning of Days, or End of Life, who is an High Prie&s;t, made after the Power of an endle&s;s Life; and as he was ble&s;&s;ed of the Father, &s;o are we, becau&s;e we are of the &s;ame Birth, and are Partakers of his Na|ture, and he lives in us, and we in him.</P>
<P>Well, my dear Companions, I need not multiply Words unto you, as if you knew not the&s;e Things; for, what know I, that you know not? Or, what can I &s;ay, but you know the &s;ame? Yet bear with me, for my Heart is very full, and my Soul ready to be poured forth, that I may once more expre&s;s a little Quantity of what is abounding in my Heart; for Love, even perfect Love, even that Love wherewith we are beloved of the Father, filleth my Heart at this Time towards all of you, from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t; and I know nothing but Love towards you all; and I doubt not but in the &s;ame Love you do receive this my <HI>Salutation,</HI> which is from the Fountain of Love, which at this Time is opened in my Heart.</P>
<P>Now, dearly Beloved, the pre&s;ent Con&s;iderations of my Heart are very many concerning the great Love of the Father, which hitherto hath been &s;hewed unto us; we all know, how that he called us by his Grace, and turned our Hearts from the Vanities, and evil Ways of this World, and &s;anctified us by his Word, and put his Image up|on us, and called us by his Name, and redeemed us unto him&s;elf, and gave us the Te&s;timony of his holy Spirit in our own Hearts, <HI>That we &s;hould be his People, and he would be our God;</HI> he taught us, and in&s;truc|ted us, and fed us, and gave us Peace and Re&s;t in him&s;elf, and freed us from the Bondage of Sin and Corruption, and from his Terror be|cau&s;e of Sin; and he removed our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and blotted them out, and cea&s;ed to &s;mite us any more, but brought us into the Land of Re&s;t, flowing with Mercy, and Peace, and Knowledge, and all good Things: This did the Lord our God do for us, in the Days of our Infancy, even when we were yet in our Sins, he called us forth, and clean&s;ed us from them; and when we were Strangers to him, he made him&s;elf known unto us; and when we were wholly ignorant, he gave us Knowledge, and when we were not a People, he rai&s;ed us up, and made us worthy to be called by his Name; and thus, and after this Manner did the Father love us, and &s;hew his Love unto us: This you know even as I do, and the Con&s;ideration of it cau&s;eth me thus to expre&s;s it.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="003104_0271_0FEFF5BE610C24E0">Again, when he had thus wrought for us, and &s;hewed Love unto us, he was plea&s;ed to call us out into his Work, to the turning and converting of others unto the Way of Life; he put his Spirit into us, and gave us Gifts of Knowledge and Utterance, and armed us with Wi&s;dom, and Strength, and Courage, and every Way fitted us for that Work and Service in which he hath carried us on; he, I &s;ay, fitted us for his Work, and called us into it, and carried us on joyfully in it, and all this of his free Love, and infinite Power; and what we have been, and what we have done, it hath been only of the Lord, and not of our &s;elves, even of his Love which to us may be admirable; for alas, what were we but Children, and neither Pro|phets, nor Prophets Sons, and our Education unan&s;werable for the&s;e Things, and to perform this Calling? And therefore it is the Lord, and only him that hath effected his own Purpo&s;e through us, and by us, as In&s;truments mean of our &s;elves, but by him very excellent.</P>
<P>Again, he hath mightily pro&s;per'd us in his Work, and a glorious Effect we have beheld of our Labours, and Travels, and Te&s;timony; yea, the Lord hath been with us abundantly, and his Arm hath com|pa&s;&s;ed us about, and he hath often given us great Victory over the Wi&s;e and Prudent of this World; he hath made his own Word often very powerful in our Mouths, to the wounding of the Con|&s;ciences of our Enemies; and the Lord hath ble&s;&s;ed our Te&s;timony, to the Confounding of the Wi&s;dom of this World, and to the gather|ing of many unto him&s;elf; and he hath gone forth before us in his Authority, and been always with us in his own Work; and our Te|&s;timonies, Labours, and Travels have been very precious and plea&s;ant unto the Lord, and all his People, and the Effect thereof cau&s;eth my Soul to rejoice, becau&s;e the Lord hath been with us, and pro&s;|pered us unto a great People, who have received our Witne&s;s, and ac|cepted thereof unto their Salvation, and unto the Lord alone the Glory of all this appertaineth.</P>
<P>And for the&s;e eight Years and upward, the Hand of the Lord hath carried us thro' great Labours and Travels in his Service, and many Dangers, and Per&s;ecutions, and Afflictions have attended us all this Time; and ye know that many a Time hath the Lord delivered us from the Hands of &s;uch as would have de&s;troyed us; and we have been de|livered again, and again, out of Dangers and Difficulties, and the Lord hath been a pre&s;ent Help unto us in the Time of our Trouble; for the Plotting of the Wicked, and the Purpo&s;e of ungodly Men, hath often been broken for our Sakes, even many a Time have we been delivered out of the Snare that hath been laid for us, and we have &s;een our Enemies fall before us on the Right Hand, and on the Left; even the Wi&s;e in their Worldly Wi&s;dom, and the Fooli&s;h in their Bruti&s;hne&s;s, both Profe&s;&s;ors and Profane hath our God often cut &s;hort in their De&s;ires and Endeavours of our De&s;truction; and we have been wonderfully pre&s;erved unto this Day; and all this I attribute to the infinite Love and Power of the Lord God, who is ble&s;&s;ed for evermore.</P>
<P>And thro' all the&s;e Things we are yet alive, and the Lord doth not fail us unto this Hour, but he lives and walks in us, and with us, and his Te&s;timony is with us, even the Seal of his good Spirit in our Hearts, that we are his Sons and Servants, and we are confirmed by many Tokens that he is our God, and we are his People, and that great Oppre&s;&s;ion which we have met withal, hath not re&s;trained us, but thro' it all have we grown, and pro&s;pered unto this Day: And concerning the Things whereof we have te&s;tified the&s;e divers Years, I am no Way doubtful but our God will fulfil them, neither can

<P>And therefore, Brethren, let us be in Hope and Patience, and live in the Word of Patience, and not be faint-hearted, as tho' the Lord had forgotten us, or was unmindful of us, or as tho' he would not perform what he had te&s;tified of by us; for he is not a Man, that he &s;hould lie, nor as a Man that he is given to Change: But lift up your Heads, for the Lord is with us, even in our greate&s;t Tribulations and Afflictions, and he will accompli&s;h his Purpo&s;e; for he is mighty to &s;ave his People, and to de&s;troy his Enemies.</P>
<P>It is true, the Gates of Hell at this Time &s;eem to be open again&s;t us, and we are a People like to be &s;wallowed up of our Enemies, and Floods of Wickedne&s;s &s;eem to overflow, and the Waves of the great Sea &s;eem to be void of Mercy, and the Hope of our Adver&s;aries is to extingui&s;h us from being a People, and to de&s;troy us from the Face of the Earth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and the Hands of our Per&s;ecutors are highly exalted at this Day, as tho' all that we have done for the Lord, by our Labours and Travels, &s;hould now be made of none Effect.</P>
<P>Well, dear Brethren, tho' it be thus, yet our God can deliver us, and confound our Adver&s;aries; and we can appeal unto our God, and can &s;pread our Cau&s;e before him; and he knows that our Sufferings and Afflictions are altogether unju&s;t, and unequal, and unrighteous, and that our Per&s;ecutors do afflict us out of their <HI>Envy,</HI> and with|out any ju&s;t Cau&s;e admini&s;tred unto them by us; our God knows it, Angels and Saints know it, that we are at this Day a per&s;ecuted People for Religion's-&s;ake; and this our pre&s;ent Affliction is not any ju&s;t Puni&s;hment, either from the Ju&s;tice of God, or from the Ju&s;tice of Men.</P>
<P>For God hath given us the Witne&s;s of his eternal Spirit, that Wrath is not in him towards us; his Wrath be to his Enemies, but unto us is Joy and Peace for evermore: And the Lord clears us, and he ju&s;ti|fies us, who then &s;hall condemn us? He chargeth no Guilt upon us, as if we were unto our &s;elves the Cau&s;e, by our Evil Deeds, of the&s;e our pre&s;ent Sufferings, and as if this were come to pa&s;s upon us, as Puni&s;hment from the Hand of God: I &s;ay, it is not &s;o; the&s;e our pre&s;ent Sufferings are not out of God's Anger towards us, for his Love is to us, let his Wrath be to his Enemies: And as I &s;aid, neither is this Suffering in the Ju&s;tice of Men; for unto all the World we can &s;ay, (and God him&s;elf &s;hall plead our Cau&s;e) whom have we wronged or done Evil to? What Evil have we done to any Man's Per&s;on? Who&s;e Goods have we fal&s;ly taken or coveted? Again&s;t whom have we de&s;igned Mi&s;chief? Even the Lord him&s;elf be Judge between us and our Per&s;ecutors in this Matter; for unto him we are known that we do de&s;ire the Good of all, and not the Hurt of any, and yet we are dealt with as Evil-doers; when as the God of Heaven is Wit|ne&s;s in our Con&s;ciences, that we neither plot nor contrive, nor agi|tate in Thought or Word the Hurt of any Man's Per&s;on; but we

walk ju&s;tly towards all, it being our Principle to do to others as we would be done unto; and we can plead our Cau&s;e unto our God, and he &s;hall plead our Cau&s;e with our Enemies, and this is the pre|&s;ent State of our Ca&s;e; what we &s;uffer at this Time, it is &s;ingly in the Cau&s;e of God, and for Righteou&s;ne&s;s-&s;ake, and for the Te&s;ti|mony of Je&s;us, which we hold; therefore freely let us commit our Cau&s;e unto the God of Heaven, and if we die, it is for him, and if we live, it is to him; and we &s;eek not Vengeance again&s;t our Ene|mies, but leave it to the Lord to plead with them.</P>
<P>And dearly beloved, I hope I need not exhort you to be patient, and faithful, in this Day of our Trial, knowing that the Cau&s;e is &s;o excellent in which we are tried, it is God's Cau&s;e, and not our own; and I hope you all have the Te&s;timony of his Spirit in your Con&s;ci|ences, verifying the Truth of the Cau&s;e for which we &s;uffer; and ha|ving that Evidence, we need not to be doubtful as towards God, nor a&s;hamed before Men, if &s;o be that every one feels the Evidence of the Spirit of God bearing Witne&s;s, that we &s;uffer for Righteou&s;ne&s;s-&s;ake, and for the Name of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>And &s;o, dear Brethren, lift up your Heads, and be a&s;&s;ured that we are the Lord's, and in his Cau&s;e we are tried, and he will judge and avenge our Per&s;ecutors in his Sea&s;on, and we &s;hall be a People when the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> lie dead upon the Sea-&s;hore, and when the raging Sea is dried up, this &s;ame People &s;hall be &s;afe: For hath the Lord done &s;o excellent Things for us? Hath he led us forth, and ble&s;&s;ed us un|to this Day? And hath he pre&s;erved us hitherto thro' many Tribu|lations and Dangers? Hath he &s;hewed infinite Love and Favour un|to us to this Hour? And will he now &s;uffer us to be de&s;troyed from being a People? Surely no. Will he give our Enemies their Heart's De&s;ire to out us all off, that they may bla&s;pheme his Name? Surely no. And if it be the Plea&s;ure of the Lord, that &s;ome of us &s;hould &s;eal our Te&s;timony with our Blood, good is the Will of the Lord; not ours but his Will be done; for the Te&s;timony that we have born for the&s;e divers Years, hath been &s;o excellent in it &s;elf, and in its Fruits and Effects, that the fini&s;hing of it de&s;erves the be&s;t Seal that po&s;&s;i|bly we can &s;ign it with, which is indeed our Heart's Blood; and this dwells upon my Spirit; and yet, tho' it &s;hould be thus, my Con|fidence is &s;ure, that the Work of the Lord &s;hall pro&s;per, and our Te&s;timony &s;hall be glorious for ever, and this People &s;hall never be extingui&s;hed from being a People.</P>
<P>And I know not any Thing that remains upon our Part at this Day, but that we commit our &s;elves into the Hand of the Lord, li|ving in the Seed of God, wherein our Election is &s;ure, before the World was, and for ever: And let us remember one another, and pray one for another; and let us &s;tir up all the Children of our Father to Faithfulne&s;s and Patience, while we have Time; I &s;ay, let us walk to the Glory of the Lord, keeping Faith and a good Con&s;cience to our la&s;t End; our Te&s;timony &s;hall dever die, nor our Memories ever pe|ri&s;h when we are cea&s;ed to be; and tho' we &s;uffer now the Lo&s;s of Life, and all we have, yet the Effects thereof will be glorious in Ages to come, and our pre&s;ent Sufferings will ha&s;ten the Glory of God's Work throughout the World: Receive this as my Salutation to you all.</P>
<P>It is now eight Days &s;ince I left <HI>Ireland,</HI> where my Service hath been precious for the Lord for full &s;ix Months, all which Time the Lord carried me in much Faithfulne&s;s and Diligence in his Service, to the confirming of many in the Truth of God, and to the converting of
<PB N="263" REF="003104_0274_0FEFF57FAFC11130">
others; and thro' and becau&s;e of the Pre&s;ence of the Lord which was with me, I had a very precious Time, and was wonderfully pre|&s;erved thro' many Dangers and Trials; and I travelled near two thou&s;and Miles to and fro in that Land, and had very free Pa&s;&s;age in the principal Cities and Towns, till my Work for the pre&s;ent was fully ended there, having more Time than could be expected to clear my Con&s;cience to all People. It would be too large to mention every partiular Tran&s;action, wherein I perceived the eminent Hand of God with me; and al&s;o many Things I ob&s;erved concerning the pre&s;ent State of Things which I &s;hall not mention; for what have we to do with the Affairs of worldly Kingdoms? But as for Friends, it was well with them, they grow and increa&s;e in the Ble&s;&s;ings and Fulne&s;s of the Father; and when I came thence all was quiet, and very few in Pri&s;on, tho' (I &s;uppo&s;e) the Tidings of Things as they are here, will produce the &s;ame Sufferings upon them: But I hope they will be bold and valiant for the Truth, in giving their Te&s;timony by faithful Sufferings, till the&s;e Things be fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Thus I remain in Life and Death, and when I am no more, in everla&s;ting Remembrance, your dear Brother and Companion, by doing and &s;uffering for the Name of the Lord and his Truth. I am well, and at Liberty as yet.</P>

<P>And accordingly a Law was made and publi&s;hed, prohibiting all Ma&s;ters of Ships to bring any <HI>Quakers</HI> into this Juri&s;diction, and them&s;elves from coming in on Penalty of the Hou&s;e of Correction, till they &s;hould be &s;ent away.

<P>In this Apology, wherein the <HI>Quakers</HI> (who always were an harm|le&s;s People, and never made Re&s;i&s;tance with outward Arms) are com|pared to the mutinous and riotous <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> it is al&s;o &s;aid of them, that <HI>by a Back-door they found Entrance.</HI> And this reflects on &s;ome who unexpectedly came into <HI>New-England</HI> by Land, &s;ince they could find no Opportunity to come by Sea, becau&s;e the Ship-Ma&s;ters fearing the Severity of the <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Laws, were unwilling to carry any <HI>Quakers</HI> thither.

But they were pre&s;erved by an Almighty Hand; tho' this marvellous Pa&s;&s;age was repre&s;ented like a criminal Saucine&s;s by the&s;e <HI>New-England</HI> Per&s;ecutors.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="003104_0277_0FEFF5C44F831D78">It &s;eems to me that the afore&s;aid Apology, (which was publi&s;hed in Print, and likewi&s;e an&s;wered) was given forth before <HI>Mary Dyar</HI> was put to Death; but after her Death the General Court of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> &s;ent over an Addre&s;s to King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, &s;igned by their Governor <HI>John Indicot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sub&s;tance of an Addre&s;s from the Ge|neral Court at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> to K. <HI>Ch.

<P>Concerning the <HI>Quakers</HI> they &s;aid, that they were <HI>open capital Bla&s;phe|mers, and Seducers from the Glorious Trinity, the Lord Chri&s;t, the ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;|pel, open Enemies to the Government it &s;elf, and malignant Promoters of Doc|trines directly tending to &s;ubvert both Church and State.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover they &s;aid, <HI>That at la&s;t they had been con&s;trained for their own Safety to pa&s;s a Sentence of Bani&s;hment again&s;t them on Pain of Death, &s;ince the Magi&s;trate in Con&s;cience judged him&s;elf called for the Defence of all, to keep the Pa&s;&s;age with the Point of the Sword held towards them; and that this could do no Harm to them that would be warned thereby; but the</HI> Quakers <HI>ru&s;hing them&s;elves thereupon was their own Act, and a Crime bringing their Blood upon their own Heads.</HI></P>
<P>Could they have made the King believe this, they would willingly have done it; but he had too much Sen&s;e to be thus impo&s;ed upon, tho' they did whatever they could to prevent his hearing the other Par|ty, in Order whereunto they &s;aid, <HI>Let not the King hear Men's Words; your Servants are true Men, Fearers of God and the King, and not given to Change, zealous of Government and Order, not &s;editious to the Intere&s;ts of Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P>How &s;mooth and plau&s;ible &s;oever this &s;eemed, yet it could not &s;tand the Te&s;t; and <HI>E. Burroughs,</HI> who an&s;wered it in Print, addre&s;s'd the King thus.
<Q>O King, this my Occa&s;ion to pre&s;ent Thee with the&s;e Con&s;iderations is very urgent, and of great Nece&s;&s;ity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To which <HI>E.

he was chained in Pri&s;on, from the Time he was condemned, to the Day of his Execution. <HI>I am not of his Opinion; but yet truly methought the Lord did mightily appear in the Man.

<P><HI>William Leddra</HI> being thus di&s;patch'd, it was re&s;olved to make an End al&s;o of <HI>Wenlock Chri&s;ti&s;on.</HI> He therefore was brought from the Pri&s;on, to the Court at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W.Chri&s;ti&s;on</HI> brought before the Court, threatned and &s;ent buck to Pri&s;on.</NOTE> where the Governor <HI>John Indicot,</HI> and the Depu|ty Governor <HI>Richard Billingham,</HI> being both pre&s;ent, it was told him, <HI>&V;n|le&s;s you will renounce your Religion, you &s;hall &s;urely die.</HI> But in&s;tead of &s;hrink|ing, he &s;aid with an undaunted Courage, <HI>Nay, I &s;hall not change my Re|ligion, nor &s;eek to &s;ave my Life; neither do I intend to deny my Ma&s;ter; but if I lo&s;e my Life for Chri&s;t's-&s;ake, and the preaching of the Go&s;pel, I &s;hall &s;ave my Life.</HI> This noble Re&s;olution gave &s;uch a Check to his Per&s;ecutors, that they did not then go on with the Trial, but &s;ent him away to Pri&s;on again. And it being &s;aid by &s;ome Body, that <HI>William Leddra</HI> was dead, a certain Per&s;on &s;aid to <HI>Wenlock, O, thy Turn is next.</HI> To which he grave|ly reply'd, <HI>The Will of the Lord be done;</HI> &s;hewing thereby his entire Re|&s;ignation. Being now lock'd up again in Pri&s;on, he was kept there till about the 4th Month: But then the Court being &s;et, a Spirit of Con|fu&s;ion appeared there, and a Divi&s;ion among &s;everal of the Members; for tho' the greate&s;t Part were for taking the &s;ame Cour&s;e with him as with tho&s;e that were already put to Death, yet &s;everal would not con|&s;ent to it.

That the Sun abhorring this bloody Bu&s;ine&s;s, hid it &s;elf from them. But after many Debates, the &s;anguinary Council at length agreed, and <HI>Wenlock</HI> was brought to the Bar; where the Governor <HI>John Indicot</HI> asked him, <HI>What he had to &s;ay for him&s;elf, why he &s;hould not die?</HI> He an&s;wered,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W.Chri&s;ti&s;on</HI> brought to the Bar and exa|min'd.</NOTE> <HI>I have done nothing worthy of Death, if I had, I refu&s;e not to die.</HI> To this another &s;aid, <HI>Thou art come in among&s;t us in Rebellion, which is as the Sin of Witch|craft, and ought to be puni&s;hed.</HI> Hence it appears how perver&s;ely the&s;e Blood-thir&s;ty Per&s;ecutors apply'd the Holy Scriptures to their cruel Ends, and &s;o made a wrong U&s;e of the Prophet <HI>Samuel</HI>'s Words to <HI>Saul:</HI> To which fal&s;e Conclu&s;ion <HI>Wenlock</HI> an&s;wered, <HI>I came not among you in Rebellion, but in Obedience to the God of Heaven, not in Contempt to any of you, but in Love to your Souls and Bodies; and that you &s;hall know one Day, when you and all Men mu&s;t give an Account of the Deeds done in the Body. Take Heed</HI> (thus he went on) <HI>for you cannot e&s;cape the righteous Judg|ments of God.</HI> Then &s;aid Major General <HI>Adderton, You pronounce Woes, and Judgments, and tho&s;e that are gone before you pronounced Woes and Judg|ments; but the Judgments of the Lord God are not come upon us yet.</HI> So in|&s;olent and hard Hearted may Man become, as not to &s;tick even to de|fy the mo&s;t High. But before we draw the Curtains of this Stage, we &s;hall &s;ee the tragical End of this <HI>Adderton,</HI> who now received this An&s;wer from <HI>Wenlock: Be not proud, neither let your Spirits be lifted up; God doth but wait till the Mea&s;ure of your Iniquity be filled up, and that you have run your ungodly Race; then will the Wrath of God come upon you to the uttermo&s;t. And as for thy Part, it hangs over thy Head, and is near to be poured down up|on thee, and &s;hall come as a Thief in the Night &s;uddenly, when thou thinke&s;t not of it.</HI> Then <HI>Wenlock</HI> asked, <HI>By what Law will ye put me to Death?</HI> The An&s;wer was, <HI>We have a Law, and by our Law you are to die. So &s;aid the</HI> Jews, <HI>of Chri&s;t,</HI> (reply'd <HI>Wenlock) We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to die. Who impowered you to make that Law?</HI> To which one of the Board an&s;wered, <HI>We have a Patent, and are the Patentees; judge whether we have not Power to make Laws.</HI> Hereupon <HI>Wenlock</HI> asked again, <HI>How, have you Power to make Laws repugnant to the Laws of</HI> England? <HI>No,</HI> &s;aid the Governor. <HI>Then (reply'd <HI>Wenlock</HI>) you are gone beyond your Bounds, and have forfeited your Patent; and that is more than you can an&s;wer. Are you</HI> (asked he) <HI>Subjects to the King, yea, or nay? What good will that do you,</HI> reply'd the Secretary. <HI>If you are,</HI> (an&s;wered <HI>Wenlock) &s;ay &s;o; for in your Petition to the King, you de&s;ire that he would protect you, and that you may be worthy to kneel among&s;t his loyal Subjects.</HI> To which one &s;aid, <HI>Yea, we are &s;o. Well,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Wenlock, &s;o am I, and for any Thing I know, am as good as you, if not better; for if the King did but know your Hearts, as God knows them, he would &s;ee that they are as rotten towards him as they are towards God: Therefore &s;eeing that you and I are Subjects to the King, I demand to be tried by the Laws of my own Nation.</HI> It was an&s;wered, <HI>You &s;hall be tried by a Bench and a Jury:</HI> For it &s;eems they began to be afraid to go on in the former Cour&s;e, of Trial without a Jury, this being contrary to the Laws of <HI>England.</HI> But <HI>Wenlock</HI> &s;aid, <HI>That is not the Law, but the Manner of it: For I never heard, nor read of any Law that was in</HI> England <HI>to hang</HI> Quakers. To this the Governor reply'd, That <HI>there was a Law to hang</HI> Je&s;uits, To which <HI>Wenlock</HI> returned, <HI>If you put me Death, it is not becau&s;e I go under the Name of a</HI> Je&s;uit, <HI>but of a</HI> Quaker: <HI>Therefore I appeal to the Laws of my own Nation.</HI> But in&s;tead of taking Notice of this, one &s;aid, <HI>That he was in their Hands, and had broken their Law, and they would try him. Wen|lock</HI> &s;till appealed to the Law of his own Nation. Yet the Jury being called over, went out, but quickly returned, and brought him in guil|ty. Whereupon the Secretary &s;aid, Wenlock Chri&s;ti&s;on, <HI>hold up your Hand. I will not,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Wenlock, I am here, and can hear thee.</HI> Then the Secretary cried, <HI>Guilty or not Guilty. I deny all Guilt,</HI> reply'd <HI>Wenlock, for

my Con&s;cience is clear in the Sight of God.</HI> But the Governor &s;aid, <HI>The Ju|ry hath condemned thee. Wenlock</HI> an&s;wer'd, <HI>The Lord doth ju&s;tify me; who art thou that condemne&s;t?</HI> They then voted as to the Sentence of Death, but were in a Manner confounded, for &s;everal could not vote him guilty of Death. The Governor &s;eeing this Divi&s;ion, &s;aid, <HI>I could find in my Heart to go Home;</HI> being in &s;uch a Rage, that he flung &s;ome|thing furiou&s;ly on the Table; which made <HI>Wenlock</HI> cry, <HI>It were better for thee to be at home than here, for thou art about a bloody Piece of Work.</HI> Then the Governor put the Court to vote again; but this was done confu&s;edly, which to incen&s;ed the Governor, that he &s;tood up, and &s;aid, <HI>You that will not con&s;ent, record it; I thank God, I am not afraid to give Judgment.</HI> Thus we &s;ee that to be drunk with Blood doth not quench the Thir&s;t after Blood; for <HI>Indicot</HI> the Governor, &s;eeing others backward to vote, precipitately pronounced Judgment him&s;elf, and &s;aid, Wen|lock Chri&s;ti&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Indicot</HI> pro|nounces Sen|tence of Death again&s;t him.</NOTE> <HI>hearken to your Sentence: You mu&s;t return unto the Place from whence you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution, and there you mu&s;t be hang'd until you are dead, dead, dead.</HI> To which <HI>Wenlock</HI> &s;aid, <HI>The Will of the Lord be done, in who&s;e Will I came among&s;t you, and in who&s;e Coun&s;el I &s;tand, feeling his eternal Power, that will uphold me unto the la&s;t Ga&s;p.</HI> Moreover he cried thus; <HI>Known be it unto you all, that if ye have Power to take my Life from me, my Soul &s;hall enter into everla&s;ting Re&s;t and Peace with God, where you your &s;elves &s;hall never come.

What do you gain by it? For the la&s;t Man that you have put to Death, here are five come in his Room. And if ye have Power to take my Life from me, God can rai&s;e up the &s;ame Principle of Life in ten of his Servants, and &s;end them among you in my Room, that you may have Torment upon Torment, which is your Por|tion; for there is no Peace to the Wicked, &s;aith my God.</HI> The holy Confi|dence with which he uttered the&s;e Words, &s;hew, and the Sequel made it appear plainly, that &s;omething &s;upernatural was contained in them: And it is remarkable, that among the impri&s;on'd <HI>Quakers,</HI> there were then &s;everal that had been bani&s;hed on Pain of Death; and among the&s;e al&s;o <HI>Elizabeth Hooton,</HI> and <HI>Edward Wharton</HI> &s;taid in his Habitation contrary to his Sentence of Bani&s;hment. <HI>Wenlock</HI> having received Sen|tence of Death, was brought to Pri&s;on again, where having been de|tain'd five Days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is brought back to Pri&s;on, detain'd five Days, and then with 27 more of his Friends &s;et at Liberty.</NOTE> the Mar&s;hal and a Con&s;table came to him, with an Order from the Court for his Enlargement, with twenty-&s;even more of his friends, then in Pri&s;on for their Te&s;timony to the Truth, &s;aying, They were ordered by the Court to make him acquainted with their new Law. <HI>What means this?</HI> &s;aid <HI>Wenlock, Have ye a new Law?

<P>Whil&s;t the &s;aid <HI>G.

He al&s;o predicted the Pe&s;tilence, as may be mentioned here|after in due Place; and &s;ignified not ob&s;curely that Endeavours would be u&s;ed publickly to introduce Super&s;tition and Idolatry: But that tho&s;e who intended to do &s;o, &s;hould be fru&s;trated by the Lord in their Attempts. And that others, who&s;e Wor&s;hip al&s;o did di&s;plea&s;e the Lord, &s;hould grind and wa&s;te one another: But that beyond their Expectation he would pluck out from them, and pre&s;erve a holy Seed. And that after he &s;hould have executed his Vengeance upon the rebellious and treacherous Dealers, he would then bring forth the Remnant of his holy Seed, which &s;hould be pre&s;erved from their Fury, and then they &s;hall &s;pread over all, and &s;tand in Dominion.</Q> <HI>But,</HI> thus continued he, <HI>Altho' the&s;e Things, touching the holy Remnant, &s;hall certainly be fulfilled in their Sea&s;on, yet before they will be fully accompli&s;hed, great will be the Tryals of many of the Righteous, and there will be great Judg|ments executed in thee, 0 Land, by him who oftimes makes a fruitful Land barren becau&s;e of the Wickedne&s;s of them that dwell therein.</HI> This and much more he writ, and publi&s;h'd it in Print. Several of his Predictions we have &s;een fulfilled, as in the Progre&s;s of this Hi&s;tory may appear: And this la&s;t we mu&s;t refer to Time. After the Writing of this Treati&s;e, he al&s;o gave forth the following Prayer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Prayer.</NOTE> <HI>Surely it was thou, O Lord, that gave Bounds unto the Sea, that the Floods thereof could not overwhelm thy Cho&s;en: Thou can&s;t let forth the Winds, and &s;uf|fer a Storm, and thou can&s;t make a Calm when thou plea&s;e&s;t. Have thou the Glory of all, thou King of Saints, thou Saviour of</HI> I&s;rael. <HI>Thou can&s;t do what|ever thou plea&s;e&s;t, therefore will we tru&s;t in thy Name, neither will we fear what Man can do unto us, becau&s;e thou wilt not for&s;ake us; but thou wilt plead our Cau&s;e in the Sight of our Adver&s;aries, and they &s;hall know that thou art our God, who art able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t. O Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s, we will prai&s;e thy Name; for thy Mercies endure for ever. Our Eyes, O God, are un|to thee, for we have no other Helper. Our Faith, O Lord, &s;tandeth in thee, who can&s;t not forget thy People. Thou ha&s;t revealed and brought up <HI>Jacob,</HI> who wre&s;tleth with thee, and prevails as a Prince, therefore mu&s;t the Ble&s;&s;ing come. O Lord, the Birth, the Birth, cryeth unto thee, thine own Elect which long hath been oppre&s;&s;ed. Thou can&s;t not deny thy &s;elf, therefore have we Faith, and Hope which maketh not a&s;hamed. Oh Lord, how un&s;earchable are thy Ways! Thou ha&s;t even amazed thy People with the Depth of thy Wi&s;dom; thou alone wilt have the Glory of their Deliverance; and therefore ha&s;t thou &s;uffered the&s;e Things to come to pa&s;s. O Lord, thou art righteous in all thy Judgments: Only pre|&s;erve thy People, which thou ha&s;t gathered, and wilt gather unto thy &s;elf, in the Day of Tryal; that &s;o they may &s;ing of thy Power, and magnify thy Name in the Land of the Living.</HI></P>

I may not flatter any of you. My Life is in the Hand of my Maker, and not one Hair of my Head can fall to the Ground without his Provi|dence. He hath redeemed my Soul from Hell, and my Mind from the Earth; and he hath given me his good Spirit to lead me. I am henceforth no more my own, but I am the Lord's, who hath formed me to his Prai&s;e, and hath brought me forth, that I may &s;ound forth his powerful Truth among&s;t the People.

<P>Thus undaunted he &s;hew'd him&s;elf. But it was not long before he made his Exit, of which I can't but &s;ay &s;omething.

Now the Du&s;t was returned to the Earth, and the Spirit unto God who gave it. Thus he was freed of all Danger of lo|&s;ing the Crown of immortal Life, which Man by Temptation, and the Ca&s;ualties of this Life is liable unto, if he continueth not diligent|ly watchful. But this Valiant Man was now beyond the Reach of all Temptations, and &s;o I leave him, that I may pa&s;s on to other Matters.</P>

<P>Thus fully <HI>E.

But all this proved in vain; for it being well known that the <HI>Quakers</HI> denied &s;wearing, they conti|nually were vexed and per&s;ecuted, under a Pretence of not giving due Satisfaction of their being faithful to the Government, and &s;o tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ing the Laws.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Deputies from <HI>New-England</HI> came to <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> Now the Deputies of <HI>New-England</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> and endeavoured to clear them&s;elves as much as po&s;&s;ible, but e&s;pecially Prie&s;t <HI>Norton,</HI> who bowed no le&s;s reverently before the Archbi&s;hop, than before the King; and thus fawning upon the <HI>Epi&s;copalians,</HI> they found Means to keep in a Condition to vex the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, tho' they were for|bidden to put them to Death: And that many of the Bi&s;hops were great Enemies to the &s;aid <HI>Quakers,</HI> appear'd plainly from the cruel Per&s;ecu|tion, which after a &s;hort Calm, aro&s;e again in <HI>England.</HI></P>

And &s;ince Novelties often draw People after them, &s;o it was in this Ca&s;e, in&s;omuch that he got pretty many Adherents. But he did not &s;tand here; for as one Error proceeds from another, &s;o he made ano|ther extravagant Step, and let his Beard grow; in which he was fol|lowed by &s;ome. In the mean while <HI>G.

<P>Who were the two Lambs he mentions in his Letter, I can't tell; whether they were Per&s;ons that had been impri&s;oned with him in the Inqui&s;ition Jail, and converted by him as he thought; or whether he meant <HI>John Stubs</HI> and <HI>Samuel Fi&s;her,</HI> I know not; it may rather be &s;up|po&s;ed he meant <HI>Charles Bayley</HI> and <HI>Jane Stoakes</HI> who went to <HI>Rome</HI> to procure his Liberty; but <HI>J.

And another Judge that was al&s;o pre&s;ent, &s;aid, that <HI>Perrot</HI> had altogether renounced his Faith, and aim'd at nothing but his Profit.</Q></P>
<P>Such a one was <HI>John Perrot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R.

Whether he ever repented &s;incerely, I can't tell. <HI>Robert Rich,</HI> who took too much Part in the Extravagancies of <HI>James Naylor,</HI> as hath been related, did al&s;o combine with <HI>Perrot,</HI> and became e&s;tranged from the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and in that Condition he died: But he was of the Number of tho&s;e, of whom the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> &s;aid, <HI>They went out from us, but they were not of us.</HI></P>

This he pro|mi&s;ed to do, and told <HI>G. Fox,</HI> if he would come again within a Month, perhaps he might hear of their Di&s;charge. <HI>G. Fox</HI> went again to him about that Time, but he &s;aid, he thought his Letters had mi&s;carried; yet he promi&s;ed he would write again, and &s;o he did; which was of &s;uch Effect, that the &s;aid two Women were di&s;charged of their long Impri&s;onment. <HI>G.

<P>But leaving the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, I'll now give a clear and circum&s;tantial Relation of the Impri&s;onment of the fore-mentioned <HI>Katherine Evans</HI> and <HI>Sarah Cheevers,</HI> chiefly collected from Letters and Papers, written by them in Pri&s;on, and &s;ent from thence to <HI>England,</HI> where they were pub|li&s;hed in Print not long after their Return, in the Year, 1662.</P>
<P>In the Year 1658, the&s;e Women having Drawings in their Mind to travel toward <HI>Alexandria,</HI> went with a Ship from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Leghorn</HI> in <HI>Italy;</HI> and having been thirty one Days between <HI>Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Leghorn,</HI> they at length &s;afely landed at that City, where they found &s;ome of their Countrymen and Friends, and &s;taid there &s;everal Days, di&s;per&s;ing ma|ny Books when Occa&s;ion offered. They &s;poke al&s;o with People of va|rious Degrees, without being mole&s;ted by any. From thence they got Pa&s;&s;age in a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship bound for <HI>Alexandria,</HI> or <HI>Scanderoon;</HI> but the Ma&s;ter of the Ship, being in Company with another Ship going to <HI>Mal|ta,</HI> went al&s;o thither, tho' he had no Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Place: But before they came there, <HI>Katherine</HI> fell into &s;uch an Angui&s;h of Mind, that &s;he cry'd out, <HI>Oh, we have a dreadful Cup to drink at that Place!</HI> Being come into the Harbour, and &s;tanding on the Deck of the Ship, and looking upon the People who &s;tood on the Walls, &s;he &s;aid in her Heart, <HI>Shall ye de&s;troy us? If we give up to the Lord, then he is &s;ufficient to deliver us out of your Hands: But if we di&s;obey our God, all the&s;e could not deliver us out of his Hand.</HI> And &s;o all Fear of Man was taken from them. The next Day, being the fir&s;t Day of the Week, they went on Shore, where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;ul met them, and asked them, <HI>What they came there for?</HI> They an&s;wered what they thought convenient, and gave him &s;ome Books. Then he told them, <HI>There was an Inqui&s;ition;</HI> and kindly invi|ting them to his Hou&s;e, &s;aid, <HI>All that he had was at their Service while they were there.</HI> They accepting, of this Invitation, went thither, and many came to &s;ee them, whom they called to Repentance, &s;o that &s;e|veral became tender. About Night they went on Ship-board, and the next Day came again into the City, and going to the Governor, he told them he had a Si&s;ter in the Nunnery who de&s;ired to &s;ee them. Thereupon they went to the Nunnery, and talked with the Nuns, and gave them Books: And one of their Prie&s;ts, who brought them into the Chappel, would have them bow to the High Altar: But
<PB N="286" REF="003104_0297_0FEFF5E2CF4EBB50">
they refu&s;ed, being grieved becau&s;e of the Idolatry committed there, and went to the Con&s;ul's again, where they &s;taid &s;ome Weeks. During that Time, they once went into one of the Places of Wor&s;hip, in the Time of Wor&s;hip; and <HI>Katharine</HI> &s;tanding in the mid&s;t of the People, turned her Back to the High Altar, and kneeling down, &s;he lifted up her Voice in Prayer to the Lord. The Prie&s;t that officiated, put off his Surplice, and kneeled near her, till &s;he had done. Then he reach|ed forth his Hand to them to come to him, and offered her a Token, which &s;he taking to be the Mark of the Bea&s;t, refu&s;ed. Thereupon he put the Piece into <HI>Sarah</HI>'s Hand, but &s;he gave it him again, and &s;hewed him her Pur&s;e, that &s;he had to give, if any had Need, and as yet was in no Want, He then ask'd, <HI>If they were</HI> Calvini&s;ts <HI>or</HI> Lutherans? And they an&s;wering, <HI>Nay;</HI> he ask d, <HI>If they would go to</HI> Rome <HI>to the Pope.</HI> They denying this, he ask'd, <HI>If they were</HI> Catholicks? To which they &s;aid, <HI>They were true Chri&s;tians, Servants of the living God.</HI> But &s;ince they had yet learned but little of the Language &s;poken there, they expre&s;s'd them&s;elves very defectively, which they did, partly in Words, and partly by Signs, as well as they could: And many that came about them, were amazed: However at la&s;t they departed peaceably. Some Time after they went again to a Ma&s;s-hou&s;e, where the Sacrament, as they call it, was admini&s;tred: There were many Lights; and great Co&s;tline&s;s and Fineries; and being grieved becau&s;e of their Idolatry, they &s;tood about three Quarters of an Hour, weeping and trembling, e&s;pecially <HI>Katherine:</HI> And this &s;o &s;truck the Congregation with Amaze|ment, that &s;ome removed farther from them for Fear. At length they both went out, but yet under &s;uch a Trembling, that they went along the Street reeling and &s;taggering, &s;o that they became a Wonder to all that &s;aw them.</P>
<P>They were about three Months at the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;ul; and he, by Rea&s;on of that, being under a Su&s;picion, did not what he might have done to &s;ave them; but in &s;ome Re&s;pect he delivered them up to the Inqui&s;ition, tho' by his Oath he was obliged to protect the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there. In the mean while he kept them in his Hou&s;e, and &s;uffered them not to go abroad, tho' the Governor had told him, he might let them go about their Bu&s;ine&s;s; for &s;aid he, <HI>They are hone&s;t Wo|men.</HI> The Con&s;ul might al&s;o have let them go free, before they came under the Power of the Black Rod. Now they perceiving that &s;ome|thing to their Prejudice was in Agitation, and making Account un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> already that a Pri&s;on would be their Lot, they &s;ignified that they &s;u&s;pected him, and told him, <HI>That</HI> Pilate <HI>would do the</HI> Jews <HI>a Service, and yet wa&s;h his Hands in Innocency.</HI> He being at a Lo&s;s, required a Sign of them, if <HI>they were the Me&s;&s;engers of God.</HI> And they gave him to under&s;tand, that this might &s;erve for a Sign; <HI>That it would be well with them; but that it &s;hould not go off well with him.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards it happened that they were &s;ent for by the Inqui&s;ition: And that Day the Con&s;ul's Wife brought them &s;ome Victuals; but as &s;he pa&s;s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d by, <HI>Katharine</HI> was &s;mitten, as with an Arrow, to the Heart, and &s;he &s;eemed to hear a Voice, &s;aying, <HI>She hath obtained her Purpo&s;e.</HI> Then <HI>Katharine</HI> would not ta&s;te of the Meat, but went a&s;ide, and wept exceedingly. The Con&s;ul having called her, told her, The Inqui&s;ition had &s;ent for them, having received Letters from <HI>Rome,</HI> but that <HI>he did hope they &s;hould be &s;et free:</HI> Which however was not true, for he knew (as they under&s;tood afterwards) there was a Room prepared for them in the Pri&s;on of the Inqui&s;ition. Neither was it long ere there came one with a Black Rod, and the Chancellor, and the Con&s;ul, who brought them before the Lord Inqui&s;itor; and he asked them, <HI>Whether they had changed their Minds?</HI> (for it &s;eems that had been required of

<P>Now tho' from the An&s;wers of the&s;e Women, little could be got to blame them, yet they were kept clo&s;e Pri&s;oners, which &s;eem'd to grieve the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;ul, for he came to them with Tears in his Eyes, and &s;aid, <HI>He was as &s;orry as for his own Fle&s;h:</HI> For it &s;eems he had received &s;omething for delivering them up, which he would willingly have gi|ven back, if thereby he could have obtained their liberty; But a &s;lavi&s;h Fear po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him, and he never had Peace while he lived.

It was no Matter,</HI> he &s;aid: <HI>You run about to preach: and have not the true Faith.</HI> They return'd, <HI>The true Faith is held in a pure Con&s;cience, void of Offence towards God and Men. Every one hath the true Faith, that believeth in God, and in Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent: But they that &s;ay, they do be|lieve, and do not keep his Commandments, are Liars, and the Truth is not in them.</HI> The Friar confe&s;s'd this to be true, tho' he was continually very trouble&s;ome to them with Threats, to make them turn; and to this End they were lock'd up in a Room &s;o exceeding hot, that it was &s;aid, it was impo&s;&s;ible they could live long in it.

<P>At another Time being examined, they were asked, <HI>How many of their Friends were gone forth in the Mini&s;try, and into what Parts?</HI> They an&s;wering to that Query what they knew, it was told them, <HI>All that came where the Pope had any thing to do, &s;hould never go back again.</HI> But they &s;aid, <HI>The Lord was as &s;ufficient for them, as he was for the Children in the fiery Furnace, and their Tru&s;t was in God. Katharine</HI> being &s;ickly, was ask'd, <HI>Why &s;he lookt &s;o, whether her Spirit was weak?</HI> She an&s;wered, <HI>Nay, my Bo|dy is weak, becau&s;e I eat no Meat.</HI> The Friar hearing this, offered her a Licen&s;e to eat Fle&s;h; for it was in their <HI>Lent.</HI> But &s;he refu&s;ed this, and &s;aid, <HI>She could not eat any thing at all.</HI> And going afterwards to Bed, &s;he lay there Night and Day for twelve Days together, fa&s;ting and &s;weating, for &s;he was in much Affliction, and great was her Agony.</P>
<P>After having lain Ten Days, there came to her two Friars, the Chan|cellor, the Man with the Black Rod, a Phy&s;ician, and the Keeper.

To which he &s;aid, <HI>He had brought her a Phy&s;ician in Charity;</HI> and &s;he re|turned, <HI>The Lord is my Phy&s;ician and my &s;aving Health.</HI> The Monk growing angry, &s;aid, <HI>She &s;hould be whipt and quartered, and burnt that Night at</HI> Malta, <HI>and her Mate too.</HI> But &s;he told him mode&s;tly, <HI>She did not fear; the Lord was on their Side: And he had no Power but what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> received: And if he did not u&s;e it to the &s;ame End the Lord gave it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> would judge him.</HI> At the&s;e Words, they were all &s;truck dumb, and went away.

<P>Late in the Evening &s;omething was proclaimed at the Pri&s;on-Gate, by beating of a Drum, and early in the Morning &s;ome came again with a Drum and Guns. It &s;eems to me that this was done on Purpo&s;e to frighten the&s;e poor Women, and to make them believe that they &s;hould be put to Death; for indeed they look'd for little le&s;s, having for &s;e|veral Weeks expected that they &s;hould be led to the Stake: But they were fully re&s;igned, and given up to what the Lord might be plea&s;ed to permit. In the mean while, <HI>Katharine</HI> continuing &s;ickly, the Friar came again with the Phy&s;ician. But &s;he told him, <HI>She could not take any Thing, unle&s;s &s;he felt Freedom.</HI> He then &s;aid, <HI>They mu&s;t never come forth of that Room while they lived:</HI> And pretending to be kind to them, he farther &s;aid, <HI>You may thank God and me, that it is no wor&s;e; for it was like to be wor&s;e.</HI> Thereupon they &s;aid, That <HI>if they had died, they had di|ed as innocent as ever any Servants of the Lord.</HI> He then &s;aid, <HI>It was well they were innocent;</HI> and turning to <HI>Sarah,</HI> he bid her, <HI>Take Notice what Tor|ment</HI> Katharine <HI>&s;hould be in at the Hour of Death;</HI> &s;aying, <HI>Thou&s;ands of De|vils would fetch her Soul to Hell.</HI> But <HI>Sarah</HI> told him, <HI>She did not fear any &s;uch Thing.</HI> He then asked <HI>Katharine, if &s;he did not think it expedient for the Elders of the Church to pray over the Sick.</HI> And &s;he &s;aid, <HI>Yea, &s;uch as are moved of the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> He then fell down on his Knees, and did howl, and wi&s;h bitter Wi&s;hes upon him&s;elf, if he had not the true Faith. The Phy&s;ician in the mean while was enraged, becau&s;e &s;he did not bow to him.</P>
<P>Now whil&s;t <HI>Katharine</HI> was &s;ick, <HI>Sarah</HI> was not without great Afflic|tion; for it grieved her to &s;ee her dear Companion &s;o ill; and &s;he ea&s;ily fore&s;aw, that if <HI>Katharine</HI> died, her own Sufferings would be heavier. But yet &s;he was given up to the Will of the Lord, and would not in the lea&s;t grudge at <HI>Katharine</HI>'s eternal Re&s;t. But in Time, <HI>Katharine</HI> be|gan to mend, and grow hungry; and eating, &s;he was refre&s;hed. But the Room wherein they were locked was &s;o exce&s;&s;ively hot, that they were often fain to ri&s;e out of their Bed, and lie down at the Chink of the Door, for Air to fetch Breath. And this Heat was the greater, be|cau&s;e it came not only from without, but within al&s;o; which &s;o affec|ted them, that their Skin was parched, and the Hair fell off their Heads, and they fainted often; and their Afflictions were &s;o great, that when it was Day, they wi&s;hed for Night; and when it was Night, they wi&s;h|ed for Day; yea, thro' human Weakne&s;s they de&s;ired Death, eating their Bread weeping, and mingling their Drink with Tears. Once <HI>Ka|tharine</HI> asked the Monks, who came to her with a Phy&s;ician, and &s;aid it was in Charity, <HI>Whether they did not keep them in that hot Room to kill them, and bring a Phy&s;ician to keep them longer alive?</HI> To this the Friar &s;aid, <HI>The Inqui&s;itor would lo&s;e his Head, if he &s;hould take them thence; and it was better to keep them there than to kill them.</HI> Then they writ to the Inqui&s;itor, and laid their Innocency before him; and &s;aid al&s;o, <HI>If it were their Blood they thir&s;ted after, they might take it any other Way, as well as to &s;mother them in that hot Room.</HI> But this &s;o incen&s;ed him, that he &s;ent the Friar to them, who took away their Ink-horns, their Bibles being taken from them be|fore
<PB N="291" REF="003104_0302_0FEFF6255ED5FB60">
They asked then, <HI>Why their Goods were taken away?</HI> To which it was an&s;wered, <HI>All is ours; and your Lives too if we will.</HI> Then they ask|ed, <HI>How they had forfeited their Lives?</HI> To which it was told them, <HI>For bringing Books and Papers.</HI> They reply'd, <HI>If there were any Thing in them that was not true, they might write again&s;t it.</HI> To this the Monk &s;aid, <HI>They &s;corned to write to Fools and A&s;&s;es, that did not know true Latin.</HI> And it was farther told them, <HI>The Inqui&s;itor would have them &s;eparated, becau&s;e</HI> Katha|rine <HI>was weak, and &s;he &s;hould go into a cooller Room; but</HI> Sarah <HI>&s;hould a|bide there.</HI> Then <HI>Katharine</HI> took <HI>Sarah</HI> by the Arm, and &s;aid, <HI>The Lord hath joined us together, and Woe be to them that part us. I had rather die here with my Friend, than part from her.</HI> This &s;o &s;truck the Friar, that he went away, and came no more in five Weeks, and the Door of their Room was not opened in all that Time.</P>
<P>Then the Monks came again to part them, but <HI>Katharine</HI> was &s;ick, and broken out from Head to Foot. They thereupon &s;ent for a Doctor, and he &s;aid, <HI>They mu&s;t have Air, or el&s;e they mu&s;t die.</HI> This was told the Inqui&s;itor, and he ordered the Door to be &s;et open &s;ix Hours in a Day. But ten Weeks after, they were parted; which was &s;uch a grievous Af|fliction, that they declared, Death it &s;elf would not have been &s;o hard to them. But the Monks &s;aid, <HI>They corrupted each other, and that being parted, they would bow and &s;ubmit.</HI> But they &s;aw them&s;elves di&s;appointed; for the Women were &s;tronger afterwards than before, the Lord fitting them for every Condition. Before they were parted, the Friars brought them a Scourge of &s;mall Hempen Cords, asking them, <HI>If they would have it?</HI> and &s;aying, <HI>they were u&s;ed to whip them&s;elves till the Blood came.</HI> But the Women &s;aid, <HI>that could not reach the Devil, he &s;at upon the Heart.</HI> Then the Monks &s;aid, <HI>All the People of</HI> Malta <HI>are for you; if ye will be Catholicks, none but will like you.</HI> To which they returned, <HI>The Lord hath changed us into that which changeth not.</HI> The Monks then &s;aid, <HI>All our holy Women do pray for you; and ye &s;hall be honoured of all the World, if ye will turn.</HI> They replied, <HI>The World lies in Wickedne&s;s, and the Honour and Glory of the World we have denied.</HI> To this the Monks &s;aid, <HI>Ye &s;hall be honoured of God too; but now ye are hated of all. This,</HI> &s;aid one of the Women, <HI>is an evident To|ken who&s;e Servants we are. The Servant is not greater than his Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Once on a fir&s;t Day of the Week the Friars came, and commanded them <HI>to kneel down with them to Prayer.</HI> They &s;ignified they could not pray, but as they were moved by the Lord. Then the Friars comman|ded them the &s;econd Time, and kneeled down by their Bed&s;ide, and pray|ed after this Manner; which being done, they &s;aid to the Women, <HI>We have tried your Spirits, now we know what Spirit ye are of.</HI> But they told them, <HI>They could not know that, unle&s;s their Minds were turned to the Light of Chri&s;t in their Con&s;ciences.</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Friar then growing angry, &s;hew|ed them his Crucifix, and bid them look on it. But they told him, the Lord &s;aith, <HI>Thou &s;halt not make to thy &s;elf the Likene&s;s of any Thing that is in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath, or in the Water under the Earth; thou &s;halt not bow to them, nor wor&s;hip them, but I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.</HI> The Friar &s;eeing <HI>Sarah</HI> &s;peak &s;o boldly to him, called for the Irons to chain her. She then bowed her Head, and &s;aid to him, <HI>Not only my Hands and Feet, but my Neck al&s;o for the Te&s;timony of Je&s;us.</HI> The Friar &s;eeming appea&s;ed, &s;aid, <HI>He would do them any Good he could; far he &s;aw what they did was not in Malice.</HI> And the Friars came often and &s;aid to them, <HI>If ye would but do a little, ye &s;hould be &s;et at Liberty; but you will do nothing at all, but are again&s;t every Thing.</HI> To which they returned, <HI>that thy would do any Thing that might tend to God's Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were impri&s;oned here, it happened that the Inqui&s;ition-Hou&s;e was new built, or repaired, which took up about the Space of a Year and a Half; and during this Time &s;ome of the great Ones
<PB N="292" REF="003104_0303_0FEFF5E6D4BAB3A0">
came often to &s;ee the Building, which gave Opportunity to the&s;e Wo|men to &s;peak to them, and to declare the Truth in the Name ot the Lord.</P>
<P>Now tho' they were threatned by the Monks for preaching the Light of Chri&s;t &s;o boldly, yet not only the Magi&s;trates, but the Lord Inqui|&s;itor grew moderate towards them, and gave Order they &s;hould have Pens, Ink and Paper to write to <HI>England.</HI> And they &s;eemed inclined to have &s;et them at Liberty; but the Friars workt mightily again&s;t it; and had laboured about three Quarters or a Year to part them, before they could bring it to pa&s;s. And when at length they had effected it, they told <HI>Katharine, That they &s;hould never &s;ee one another's Faces again.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while, <HI>Katharine</HI> being &s;ickly, had little Stomach to eat, and had no Mind to eat any Thing but what came from <HI>Sarah</HI> to her. And having told one of the Friars, that &s;he wanted &s;ome body to wa&s;h her Linnen, and to prepare &s;ome warm Victuals for her, he &s;ent to <HI>Sa|rah,</HI> to know if &s;he would do it for her; and &s;he &s;aid &s;he would. And by that Means they for &s;ome Weeks heard of one another every Day; and the Friar &s;aid once to <HI>Katharine, You may free your &s;elf of Mi&s;ery when you will; you may make your &s;elf a Catholick, and have your Freedom to go where you will:</HI> To which &s;he told him, <HI>Thus I might have a Name that I did live, when I was dead. Thou ha&s;t Catholicks enough already. Endeavour to bring &s;ome of them to the Light in their Con&s;ciences, that they may &s;tand in awe, and &s;in not.</HI> But he was &s;o eager, that he &s;aid, <HI>He would lo&s;e one of his Fingers, if &s;he and</HI> Sarah <HI>would be Catholicks.</HI> Then &s;he told him, <HI>It was</HI> Babylon <HI>that was built with Blood, but</HI> Sion <HI>was redeemed thro' Judgment.</HI> Many Ways were u&s;ed to draw them off; and once they would have per&s;waded her to &s;et a Picture at her Bed's Head, for a Repre&s;entation: But &s;he &s;aid as with Abhorrence, <HI>What, do ye think I want a Calf to wor|&s;hip? Do ye walk by the Rule of Scripture?</HI> To which the Friar &s;aid, <HI>We do, but we have Traditions too.</HI> She replied, <HI>If your Traditions derogate or di&s;&s;ent from the Fundamentals of Chri&s;t's Doctrine, the Prophets and Apo&s;tles, I deny them in the Name of the Lord.</HI> But he a&s;&s;erted <HI>that they did not.</HI> Then &s;he asked, <HI>What Rule they had to burn tho&s;e that could not joyn with them for Con&s;cience Sake?</HI> And he returned, <HI>St.</HI> Paul <HI>did wor&s;e, for he gave them to the Devil;</HI> and farther &s;aid, <HI>that they did judge all damned that were not of their Faith.</HI> Then &s;he objected to him &s;everal of the &s;uper&s;titious Rites of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and mentioned al&s;o the <HI>forbidding of Mar|riage, which,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 1. 3.</NOTE> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>is a Doctrine of Devils,</HI> according to the Saying of the Apo&s;tle. The Friar being put to a Nonplus, told her, <HI>That St.</HI> Peter <HI>was the Pope of</HI> Rome, <HI>and did build an Altar there, and the Pope was his Suc|ce&s;&s;or, and he could do what he would.</HI> But &s;he refuted this with &s;ound Rea&s;on. He then boa&s;ting of the Antiquity of their Church, &s;he &s;ig|nified that the Church &s;he was of was yet older; for, &s;aid &s;he, <HI>Our Faith was from the Beginning; and</HI> Abel <HI>was of our Church.</HI> The Friar be|ing at a Lo&s;s, and not longer able to hold out again&s;t <HI>Katharine,</HI> went to <HI>Sarah,</HI> and talked with her at the &s;ame Rate; and &s;he al&s;o told him, <HI>Abel was of our Church:</HI> To which he &s;aid, <HI>Abel was a Catholick;</HI> and quite over-&s;hooting him&s;elf, he &s;aid likewi&s;e, <HI>and</HI> Cain <HI>and</HI> Judas <HI>were &s;o.</HI> To which <HI>Sarah</HI> returned, <HI>Then the Devil was a Catholick; and I won't be one; I will not turn; tho' ye would tear me to Pieces, I believe the Lord would enable me to endure it.</HI></P>
<P>At another Time the &s;aid Friar, who&s;e Name was <HI>Malachy,</HI> came a|gain to <HI>Katharine,</HI> and told her, <HI>If &s;he would be a Catholick, &s;he &s;hould &s;ay &s;o; otherwi&s;e they would u&s;e her badly, and &s;he &s;hould never &s;ee the Face of</HI> Sarah <HI>again, but &s;hould die by her &s;elf, and a thou&s;and Devils &s;hould carry her Soul to H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l.</HI> She then asked him, <HI>If he were the Me&s;&s;enger of God to her?</HI> And he &s;aid, <HI>Yes.

Monk, <HI>becau&s;e you will not be a Catholick.</HI> Whereupon &s;he &s;aid, <HI>I deny thee and thy Me&s;&s;age too, and the Spirit which &s;peaks in thee; for the Lord ne|ver &s;poke &s;o.</HI> He growing angry, &s;aid, that <HI>he would lay her in a whole Pile of Chains, where &s;he &s;hould &s;ee neither Sun nor Moon.</HI> And &s;he intimating how re&s;igned &s;he was, &s;aid, <HI>He could not &s;eparate her from the Love of God in Cri&s;t Je&s;us, lay her were-ever he would.</HI> And he farther &s;aying, <HI>he would give her to the Devil,</HI> &s;he re&s;umed, <HI>I don't fear all the Devils in Hell; the Lord is my Keeper. Tho' thou had&s;t the Inqui&s;ition, with all the Countries round about it on thy Side, and I was alone by my &s;elf, I do not fear them; if there were Thou&s;ands more, the Lord is on my Right Hand; and the wor&s;t they can do, is but to kill the Body, they can touch my Life no more than the Devil could</HI> Job's.

<P>He then went and told the Inqui&s;itor of it, who laugh'd at him; and before he came again, <HI>Katharine</HI> was moved out of that Room; when he came, he brought one of the Inqui&s;itor's Men with him, and two very good Hens, and &s;aid, <HI>The Lord Inqui&s;itor had &s;ent them in Love to her.</HI> To which &s;he &s;aid, <HI>She received his Love,</HI> but yet &s;he &s;hewed her&s;elf not very ready to accept them; and &s;ignified, <Q>That &s;he was willing to pay for them, being loth to be chargeable to any, whil&s;t &s;he had of her own.</Q> The Friar, who it &s;eems would have had them lay down their Money, at his Feet, &s;aid, <HI>They mu&s;t not count any Thing their own; for in the primitive Times, they &s;old their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and laid them down at the Apo|&s;tles Feet.</HI> He further &s;aid, <HI>You &s;hall not want any Thing, tho' we &s;hould &s;pend a thou&s;and Crowns. But you are proud, becau&s;e you will not take the Inqui&s;itor's Hens, which he &s;ent you in Charity.</HI> She then asking, <HI>What Kind of Charity this was, &s;ince he kept her in Pri&s;on?</HI> The Friar &s;aid, <HI>It was for the Good of their Souls he kept them in Pri&s;on,</HI> farther adding, <HI>If you had not been going to preach, ye might have gone where ye would.</HI> She returned, <HI>Our Souls are out of the Inqui&s;itor's Reach. Why &s;hould your Love extend more to us than to your own Family? For they commit all Manner of Sin, which you cannot charge us with. Why don't ye put them into the Inqui&s;ition, and bid them turn?</HI> He then &s;aid, <HI>You have not the true Faith;</HI> and &s;hewing her his Crucifix, ask|ed her, <HI>If &s;he thought he did wor&s;hip that?</HI> And &s;he asked him, <HI>What then did he with it?</HI> To which he an&s;wered, <HI>It was a Repre&s;entation.</HI> And &s;he replied, <HI>It did not repre&s;ent Chri&s;t, for he was the expre&s;s Image of his Father's Glory, which is Light and Life. But,</HI> continued &s;he, <HI>If thou can&s;t put any Life in any of thy Images, then bring them to me. What Repre&s;entation had</HI> Daniel <HI>in the Lion's Den, or</HI> Jonas <HI>in the Whale's Belly? They cried unto the Lord, and he delivered them.</HI> The Friar, who could not abide to hear her &s;peak &s;o much again&s;t Idols, &s;aid, <HI>She talked like a mad Woman,</HI> ad|ding, <HI>I'll give you to the Devil.</HI> She not fearing this, &s;aid, <HI>Give thy own, I am the Lord's.</HI> He then &s;tood up, and &s;aid, <HI>I will do to you, as the A|po&s;tles did to</HI> Ananias <HI>and</HI> Sapphira. She then &s;tanding up al&s;o, &s;aid, <HI>I deny thee in the Name of the Lord, the living God, thou ha&s;t no Power over me.</HI> Then away he went with the Hens to <HI>Sarah,</HI> and told her, <HI>that</HI> Katha|rine <HI>was &s;ick, and the Lord Inqui&s;itor had &s;ent two Hens, and &s;he would be glad to eat a Piece of one, if &s;he would dre&s;s one of them pre&s;ently, and the other To|morrow. Sarah</HI> no le&s;s circum&s;pect, and cautious than <HI>Katharine,</HI> and unwilling to receive this Gift, before &s;he knew what might be expedi|ent,
<PB N="294" REF="003104_0305_0FEFF5E906CE66B0">an&s;wered him accordingly as <HI>Katharine</HI> did. Then he carryed the Hens away again, &s;aying, <HI>You would fain be burnt, becau&s;e you would make the World believe you did love God &s;o well as to &s;uffer in that Kind. Katharine</HI> hearing this, &s;aid, <HI>I do not de&s;ire to be burnt; but if the Lord &s;hould call me to it, I believe he will give me Power to undergo it for his Truth: And if every Hair of my Head was a Body, I could offer them up all for the Te&s;timony of Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>The Friar coming afterwards again, ask'd <HI>Katharine, Whether &s;he had not been in&s;pired of the Holy Gho&s;t to be a</HI> Catholick, <HI>&s;ince &s;he came into the Inqui&s;ition.</HI> She &s;aid, <HI>No.</HI> But he maintaining the contrary, &s;aid, <HI>You are tho&s;e who call the Spirit of the Holy Gho&s;t, the Spirit of the Devil. No,</HI> re|plied they, (who tho' they were parted, yet could hear one another) <HI>The Spirit of the Holy Gho&s;t in us will re&s;i&s;t the Devil. And the In&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t is not wrought in the Will of Man, nor in Man's Time; but in God's Will and Time.</HI> More Di&s;cour&s;e they had about this Matter, and then asking for their Bibles, which had been taken from them, he &s;aid, <HI>They &s;hould never &s;ee them again, for they were fal&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Thus they were often troubled and importuned by the Friars, who generally came two at a Time, tho' &s;ometimes but one. One of the&s;e often lifted up his Hand to &s;trike them, but did not: For they not be|ing moved by Fear, he was put out of Countenance, and would &s;ay, <HI>They were good Women, and he would do them any Good.</HI> As indeed &s;ome|times he did work for them, and would &s;ay, <HI>It was for God's Sake, and that they ought to thank him for it.</HI> To which they replied, <HI>Tho&s;e that did any Thing for God, did not look for a Reward from Man;</HI> which once made him &s;o angry, that he &s;aid, <HI>They were the wor&s;t of all Creatures, and they &s;hould be u&s;ed wor&s;e than the</HI> Turks, Armenians, <HI>and</HI> Lutherans. Where|upon one of them &s;aid, <HI>The pure Life was ever counted the wor&s;t, and if we mu&s;t &s;uffer, we are the Lord's, and can tru&s;t him. Do what ye will with us, we do not fear any evil Tidings; we are &s;ettled and grounded in Truth; and the more ye per&s;ecute us, the &s;tronger we grow.</HI> For this they experienced, in|deed, according to what they &s;ignified in their Letters, tho' they were &s;eparated a Year from each other. The Friars coming once to <HI>Sarah,</HI> told her, <HI>If &s;he would, &s;he might go out of the Pri&s;on, and &s;ay and do nothing.</HI> And &s;he &s;aying, <HI>She would on that Account,</HI> They &s;aid, they would come next Morning. But <HI>Sarah</HI> perceived their Deceit, and therefore when they came, &s;he, to avoid the Snare, could not re&s;olve to go forth, tho' the Friars behaved them&s;elves friendly, and told her that the Inqui&s;i|tion had &s;aid, <HI>If they wanted Linnen, Woollen, Stockings, Shoes, or Money, they &s;hould have it.</HI></P>
<P>Once it happened that an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man who lived there, having heard that <HI>Sarah</HI> was in a Room with a Window next the Street, got up by the Wall, and &s;poke a few Words to her; but he was violently haled down, and ca&s;t into Pri&s;on upon Life and Death; for he was one they had taken from the Turks, and made a <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> of him. The Friars com|ing to them to know whether he had brought them any Letters, they &s;aid <HI>No.</HI> Neither had <HI>Katharine</HI> &s;een him; yet it was told them, he was like to be hang'd. Of this <HI>Sarah</HI> gave Information to <HI>Katharine,</HI> by writ|ing a few Lines to her, (for it &s;eems they then could not hear one ano|ther) and &s;he told her, &s;he thought the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Friars were the chief Ac|tors of this Bu&s;ine&s;s. This grieved <HI>Katharine,</HI> and &s;he wrote to <HI>Sarah</HI> a|gain, (for they had a private Way to &s;end to each other.) In this Let|ter, after her Salutation, &s;he &s;aid to <HI>Sarah,</HI> <Q>That &s;he might be &s;ure, the Friars were the chief Actors; but that &s;he believed the Lord would pre&s;erve that poor <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man for his Love, and that &s;he was made to &s;eek the Lord for him with Tears: And that &s;he de&s;ired her to &s;end him &s;omething once a Day, if the Keeper would carry it. That &s;he her &s;elf was ravi&s;hed with the Love of God to her Soul, and her

Beloved was the chiefe&s;t of ten Thou&s;ands; and that &s;he did not fear the Face of any Man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ho' &s;he felt their Arrows. Moreover that &s;he had a Pro&s;pect of their &s;afe Return into <HI>England:</HI> And in the Conclu&s;ion, &s;he bid <HI>Sarah</HI> take Heed, if &s;he was tempted with Money.</Q> But this Letter, (by what Means they never knew) came to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Friar's Hands, who tran&s;lating it into <HI>Italian,</HI> delivered it to the Lord Inqui&s;i|tor; and afterwards came with Inqui&s;itor's Deputy to <HI>Katharine,</HI> and &s;hewed her both the Papers, and asked her, <HI>If &s;he could read it? viz</HI> the <HI>English</HI> one. <HI>Yea,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>I writ it, O, did you indeed?</HI> &s;aid he. <HI>And what is it you &s;ay of me here? Nothing but what is true,</HI> replied &s;he. Then he &s;aid, <HI>Where is the Paper</HI> Sarah <HI>&s;ent?

And &s;he would not meddle with the poor Workmen.</HI> Then he &s;aid, <HI>For Gods-&s;ake tell me what</HI> Sarah <HI>did write.</HI> And &s;he told him &s;omething, and &s;aid, what &s;he &s;poke was Truth. <HI>But</HI> re|turned he, <HI>You &s;ay it is much we do not tempt you with Money.</HI> And this indeed happened afterwards. The Deputy then took <HI>Katharine</HI>'s Ink, and threw it away; and &s;o they went al&s;o; and the poor <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> was relea&s;ed next Morning. They now coming to <HI>Sarah,</HI> told her, <HI>That</HI> Katharine <HI>hone&s;tly had confe&s;s'd all, and that &s;he had be&s;t to confe&s;s too:</HI> And they threatned her with a Halter, and that they would take away her Bed and Trunk, and her Money too. To which <HI>Sarah</HI> &s;aid, <HI>It may be &s;he might not &s;end to</HI> Katherine <HI>any more:</HI> And &s;he ask'd the Deputy, <HI>Whe|ther he was a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, or a Magi&s;trate?

<P>Thus from Time to Time they &s;uffered many A&s;&s;aults; and &s;ometimes it &s;o happened, that tho&s;e who came to &s;ee them, were &s;truck to the Heart, which offended the Friars. Now at length their Money was al|mo&s;t gone, they having &s;ometimes employ'd it for Victuals. But the Friars told them, <HI>They might have kept their Money for other Services; for they &s;hould have maintain'd them whil&s;t they kept them Pri&s;oners.</HI> To this they &s;aid, <HI>They could not keep their Money, and be chargeable to others.</HI> Then it &s;o fell out, that their Stomachs were taken away, and they did eat but little for three or four Weeks, till at length they found them&s;elves obliged to Fa&s;ting for &s;everal Days together; which made the Friars &s;ay, <HI>That it was impo&s;&s;ible that People could live with &s;o little Meat, as they did.</HI> And it was told them, <HI>The Lord Inqui&s;itor had &s;aid, they might have any Thing they would.</HI> To which they &s;ignifying that it was not in their own Will they fa&s;ted, &s;aid, <HI>They mu&s;t wait to know the Mind of the Lord, what he would have them to do.</HI> They continued weak, e&s;pecially <HI>Sarah,</HI> who apprehending her Death near, did therefore dre&s;s her Head as &s;he would lie in the Grave. They both were &s;o feeble that they could not put on their Cloaths, neither put them off, being al&s;o unable to make their Beds. And tho' they de&s;ired to be together in one Room, yet the Friars would not permit it: In this Condition they concluded they were like to die: But Heaven had provided otherwi&s;e. <HI>Katharine</HI> about that Time being exerci&s;ed in Supplication to the Lord, that it might plea&s;e him to put an End to their Trial, which Way it &s;eemed good in his Sight, thought &s;he heard a Voice, &s;aying, <HI>Ye &s;hall not die,</HI> and &s;he took this to be a Heavenly Voice: And from that Time they felt them&s;elves refre&s;hed with the living Pre&s;ence of the Lord, to their great Joy and Comfort, &s;o that they felt Freedom to eat again; and
<PB N="296" REF="003104_0307_0FEFF5EAC021A160">
then they were provided with good Victuals, but yet they were under a Fear of Eating any Thing which in &s;ome Re&s;pect might be counted unclean; and therefore they cried unto the Lord, and &s;aid, <HI>We had ra|ther die, than eat any Thing that is polluted and unclean.</HI> And <HI>Katharine</HI> be|lieved it was &s;aid to her from the Lord, <HI>Thou may'&s;t as freely eat, as if thou had&s;t wrought for it with thy Hands.</HI> And <HI>Sarah,</HI> who &s;ometimes had wrought for others in the Inqui&s;ition-Hou&s;e, was per&s;uaded that it was told her by In&s;piration, <HI>Thou &s;halt eat the Fruit of thy Hands and be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> And &s;o they did eat, and for eight or ten Days they got what|ever they did call for. But afterwards they were &s;o &s;traitned for want of Food, that it did them more Hurt than their Fa&s;t.

<P>Some Time before <HI>Daniel Baker</HI> came to <HI>Malta,</HI> it had been told them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Sorts of Means u&s;ed to pervert them.</NOTE> that if they would turn Catholicks, they might dwell at <HI>Malta.</HI> To which their An&s;wer was, That <HI>that they were true</HI> Catholiks.

It was al&s;o told them, if they would ki&s;s the Cro&s;s, they &s;hould be relea&s;ed; and they might &s;tay at the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;ul until an Opportunity offered to carry them to <HI>England.</HI> In the mean while they heard that the Pope had given Order to let them pa&s;s to <HI>England</HI> without doing them any Hurt. But however it was, they were pre&s;erved well contented, and they &s;aid re&s;olutely, that they would not ki&s;s the Cro&s;s, nor purcha&s;e their Li|berty at that Rate.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But they con|tinue &s;tedfa&s;t and inflexi|ble.</NOTE> It &s;eems the Con&s;ul aim'd at &s;ome Advantage by their Relea&s;ment, for he told them that the Inqui&s;itor had &s;aid, <HI>If any one would engage for three or four thou&s;and Dollars to be paid if ever they came thither again, they &s;hould be &s;et at Liberty.</HI> This he &s;aid al&s;o to <HI>D.

Yet there were many that &s;ought to obtain their Liberty, &s;hewing them&s;elves willing to engage for what was rea|&s;onable, but all their Endeavours were in vain.</P>
<P>Once they fa&s;ted three Days, and tho' it was a cold Sea&s;on, they &s;at upon the Ground, with very little Clothes on, without Stockings or Shoes, having nothing upon their Heads but A&s;hes. The Inqui&s;itors &s;eeing it, wondered exceedingly; and <HI>Sarah</HI> began to &s;peak zealou&s;ly again&s;t Super&s;tition and Idolatry.

After <HI>Katharine</HI> had joyfully &s;ung thus, &s;he went to the Well in the Court, and drank much Water in the Sight of the Pri&s;oners, as did <HI>Sarah</HI> al&s;o: For they were dry, and <HI>Sarah</HI> wa&s;hing her Head al&s;o in cold Water, they cry'd out in their Language, <HI>Ye will kill your &s;elves, and go to the Devil.</HI> But this they did not fear, neither caught they any Cold, and &s;o became a Wonder to others.</P>
<P>About half a Year after <HI>Daniel Baker</HI> was gone, it came into <HI>Katha|rine</HI>'s Heart, that if &s;he could &s;peak with the Inqui&s;itor, he would grant them their Liberty. And it was not long after that he came to the Inqui&s;ition-Court Chamber, which they hearing, de&s;ired to &s;peak with him, which was granted, and being admitted into his Pre&s;ence, they told him, <HI>They had not wronged or defrauded any, but had &s;uffered inno|cently almo&s;t four Years for Con&s;cience-&s;ake,</HI> &amp;c. After this, the Inqui&s;itor was very courteous to them, and promi&s;ed their Liberty in a few Days, &s;aying, <HI>He would &s;end for the Con&s;ul, and get him to engage for five hundred Dollars to be paid for them if ever they came again. And in Ca&s;e the Con&s;ul denied this, he would &s;end to</HI> Rome <HI>to the Pope, to &s;et them at Liberty without any Obligation.</HI></P>
<P>Not many Days after, the Inqui&s;itor came with his Lieutenant, the Chancellor, and others, and after &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e, asked them, <HI>Whether they would return back again to their Husbands and Children, if it were the Will of God?</HI> To which they an&s;wered, <HI>It was their Intent in the Will of God &s;o to do.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>K.

<P>Being thus &s;et at Liberty, they kneeled down, and prayed God never to lay to their Charge what they did unto them, becau&s;e they knew them not. And then they were delivered into the Con&s;ul's Hands, who told them, that he had engaged for them to get them free; but they could never find that it was true. Now they were kept eleven Weeks at the Con&s;ul's Hou&s;e, before they could get Pa&s;&s;age from thence. <HI>Ka|tharine</HI> in the mean while being under a great Concern, becau&s;e of a Judgment that was impending over the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Katharine</HI> writes to the Rulers of <HI>Malta,</HI> there|to moved by the Lord.</NOTE> writ a Paper to the Ru|lers of <HI>Malta,</HI> in which &s;he &s;aid, that on the 25th of the Month called <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> it came upon her from the Lord to write thus to them in his Name; <Q>My Wrath is kindled again&s;t you, and my Judgment is &s;et up among&s;t you, becau&s;e of your Hardheartedne&s;s and Unbelief.

<P>This and more &s;he wrote, and delivered to the Con&s;ul to give it to the grand Ma&s;ter, and the re&s;t of the Governours.

What further became of the Paper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A dreadful Tempe&s;t and Earthquake at <HI>Malta.</HI></NOTE> I do not find, but this, that on the 8th of <HI>October</HI> there was great Thunder and Lightning, which &s;et on Fire and blew up one of the Powder-hou&s;es about a Mile out of the City, and another Powder-hou&s;e was thrown down; and in the City five Hou&s;es were overthrown, mo&s;t of the Gla&s;s Windows of the Palaces and other Hou&s;es broke, the Doors lifted off their Hooks, the Walls torn, and the whole City terribly &s;haken, &s;o that being at Midnight, a Cry went up thro' the whole City, and the Bells were rung. At the Bed's Feet where <HI>Katharine</HI> and <HI>Sarah</HI> lay, was a Gla&s;s Window, which al&s;o was broken, but they received no Hurt, tho' the Hou&s;e was &s;o &s;haken, that they did exceedingly fear and quake; but being given up unto the Lord to live or to die, their Fear was &s;oon taken from them, and turned into Joy in the Lord.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Con&s;ul vi&s;its them.</NOTE> When it was Day, the Con&s;ul came to them, and they being &s;till and quiet, he asked whether they were not dead. And while he was &s;peaking, others came in, telling what was done in the City; and he told them that even the Ships in the Harbour had &s;uffered Damage. Then they &s;aid, <HI>One Woe is pa&s;t, and behold another Woe cometh quickly, if ye do not repent.</HI></P>
<P>Some Days after,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sarah</HI> fa&s;ts, and de&s;ires the Grand Ma&s;ter to pro|claim a Fa&s;t.</NOTE> <HI>Sarah</HI> fa&s;ted, &s;itting upon the Ground with A&s;hes upon her Head, her Neck and Shoulders bare, and &s;he &s;poke to the Con&s;ul to de&s;ire the Grand Ma&s;ter <HI>to proclaim a Fa&s;t, and to make the Peo|ple to meet together to wait upon the Lord, with their Minds turned to him; that &s;o he might turn away his Judgments from them; for the Hour of his Judg|ments was come, wherein the painted Harlot &s;hould be &s;tripped naked, and receive a Cup of Trembling from the Hand of the Lord.</HI> The Con&s;ul performed this Me&s;&s;age to the Magi&s;trates; and the Friars &s;aid, the Women had a good Intent. Some Time after, the Inqui&s;itor came, and talking with them, &s;aid, <HI>Your Intent is good, but the Devil hath deceived you.</HI> And they asked him, <HI>Whether the Devil could give Power over Sin?</HI> To which he &s;aid, <HI>The Devil could transform him&s;elf into an Angel of Light.</HI> This they a&s;&s;ented to, but yet &s;aid, <HI>He could not hide him&s;elf from the Children of Light; tho' they that were in the dark could not di&s;cern him.</HI> He could not abide to hear this, but went away, and the Con&s;ul, who was pre&s;ent, wrought again&s;t them to get them into Bondage again, but in vain. Many now died in the Town of a violent Fever: Whether any other Di&s;a&s;ter followed upon their Prediction, I can't tell.</P>
<P>At length there came one of the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Frigates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They go aboard an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Frigate, as do &s;ome Knights of <HI>Malta,</HI> and the Inqui&s;i|tor's Brother, who is kind to them.</NOTE> called the <HI>Saphire,</HI> commanded by Captain <HI>Samuel Tit&s;wel,</HI> who took them in, together with &s;ome Knights of <HI>Malta,</HI> among which was the Inqui&s;itor's Brother, who often &s;poke to the Captain, that they might not want any Thing that was in the Ship, and he told them, <HI>If they came to</HI> Mal|ta <HI>again, they &s;hould not be per&s;ecuted &s;o.</HI> And to the Captain he &s;aid, <HI>If they go to Heaven one Way, and we another, yet we &s;hall all meet together at la&s;t.</HI> But they told him, that <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Light of the World, was the only Way to the Father.</HI></P>

<HI>Portugal.</HI> This Place was at that Time be&s;ieged by the <HI>Moors,</HI> yet <HI>Ka|tharine</HI> and <HI>Sarah</HI> enter'd the Town; and many came flocking into the Hou&s;e where they were lodged; for they boldly exhorted the People to depart from Wickedne&s;s. They al&s;o went to the Governor, who was courteous to them, and took their Admonitions in good Part, and promi&s;ed to follow their Coun&s;el. And he would have given them Money; but they took none, tho' they accepted his Love: For he com|manded that none of the Garri&s;on &s;hould abu&s;e them either in Word or Deed, upon pain of &s;evere Puni&s;hment. Yet the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were ready enough to have done them a Mi&s;chief. They being inclined to go out to the <HI>Moors,</HI> de&s;ired the Governour to let them go forth; but he told them, they mu&s;t expect from that &s;avage People nothing but cruel Death or Bonds for ever. And tho' they &s;ignified to him, that they believed the Lord would pre&s;erve them, &s;ince they were per&s;uaded that he required of them to go to the <HI>Moors,</HI> yet the Governor in a friendly Manner with-held them from going. Being thus &s;topt, they believed that the Lord accepted of their Good-will. When they went aboard again, tho' in another Ship, &s;everal took Shipping with them, from a Belief that on their Account they &s;hould have a &s;afe Pa&s;&s;age. The Captain, and others that were in the Ship behaved them&s;elves very civilly towards them; and tho' they met with Tempe&s;ts, yet at length they arrived &s;afely in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Katharine</HI> afterwards related, that when (in the Inqui&s;ition) &s;he was for many Days together in Expectation that they &s;hould be burnt, &s;he &s;aw in a Dream in the Night a large Room and a great Wood-Fire, in the Chimney; and &s;he beheld one &s;itting in a Chair by the Fire, in the Form of a Servant, whom &s;he took to be the eternal Son of God. Likewi&s;e &s;he &s;aw a very amiable well-favoured Man-child &s;itting in a hollow Chair over the Fire, (not appearing to be above three Quar|ters of a Year old, and having no Cloaths on but a little fine Linnen about the upper Parts) and the Fire flamed about it; yet the Child played and was merry. She would then have taken it up, for fear it &s;hould have been burnt; but he that &s;at in the Chair bid her let it alone. Then turning about, &s;he &s;aw an Angel, and he that &s;at in the Chair bid her take up the Child, which &s;he did, and found it had no Harm. And then awaking, &s;he told her Dream to <HI>Sarah,</HI> and de&s;ired her not to fear, &s;ince the heavenly Ho&s;t thus followed them.</P>
<P>I have collected this Relation of the Occurrences of the&s;e Women at <HI>Malta</HI> from &s;everal Papers and Letters, which not long after their Return Home, were publi&s;hed in Print. And &s;ince no due Order was ob&s;erved there, and many things mentioned, which to avoid Prolixity, I have pa&s;t by, as not very material, I may have haply mi&s;s'd in &s;ome Ca&s;e or other, as to the Order or Series of Time, but yet I think the Matters of Fact are not mutilated. Now to give the Reader an Idea of the Frame of the&s;e Womens Minds and their Sufferings, I'll in&s;ert &s;ome of their Letters.

and he hath had as tender a Care over us, as he hath had of any of his Lambs which he hath called forth in this the Day of his Power, and hath carried us thro' and over as great Afflictions as mo&s;t of our Brethren and Sufferers for his Name, both in Mockings, Scoffings, Scornings, Reproaches, Stripes, Contradictions, Perils at Land, and Perils at Sea, fiery Trials, cruel Threatnings, Grief of Heart, Sorrow of Soul, Heats and Colds, Fa&s;tings and Watchings, Fears within, and Fightings without, terrible Temptations and Per|&s;ecutions, and dreadful Impri&s;onments and Buffetings of Satan; yet in all the&s;e our Trials the Lord was very gracious unto us, and did not ab&s;ent him&s;elf from us, neither &s;uffered his Faithfulne&s;s to fail us, but did bear us up, and keep us from fainting in the Mid&s;t of our Extre|mity. We had not another to make our Moan to, but the Lord alone, neither could we expect a Drop of Mercy, Favour or Refre&s;hment, but what he did di&s;til from his living Pre&s;ence, and work by his own Strength; for we &s;at one in one Room, and the other in another, near a Year; as Owls in De&s;arts, and as People for&s;aken in &s;olitary Places.

<P>O the Sorrows, the Mournings, the Tears! But tho&s;e that &s;ow in Tears, &s;hall reap in Joy. A true Sorrow begets a true Joy; and a true Cro&s;s, a true Crown: For when our Sorrows did abound, the Love of God did abound much more: The deeper the Sorrows, the greater the Joys; the greater the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ro&s;s, the weightier the Crown.</P>
<P>Dear Friends and Brethren, marvel not that <HI>I&s;rael</HI> is not gathered, our Judgment remains with the Lord, and &s;o do our Labours; for it was not for Want of Travel, nor Pain, nor Love to their Souls; for we could have been contented to have fed upon the Gra&s;s on the Ground, &s;o we might have had our Freedom among&s;t them: For, had it not been for the great Oppo&s;ition, they would have followed after us, as Chickens after a Hen, both great and &s;mall.

Oh, the Belly of Hell, the Jaws of Satan, the whole My&s;tery of Iniquity is at the Height, and all Manner of Abomination that makes de&s;olate, &s;tands where it ought not, and is upholden by a Law, That upon Pain of Death none mu&s;t &s;peak again&s;t it, nor walk contrary to it.

<HEAD>For the Hands of <HI>John Evans,</HI> my right dear and precious Husband, with my tender-hearted Children, who are more dear and precious to me than the Apple of mine Eye.</HEAD>
<P>MOST dear and faithful Husband,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Letter of <HI>Katharine</HI>'s to her Hu&s;|band and Chil|dren.</NOTE> Friend, and Brother, begotten of my eternal Father, of the immortal Seed of the Covenant of Light, Life and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, I have &V;nity and Fellow&s;hip with thee Day and Night, to my great Refre&s;hment, and continual Comfort, Prai&s;es, Prai&s;es be given to our God for evermore, who hath joined us together in that, which neither Sea nor Land can &s;eparate or divide.</P>
<P>My dear Heart, my Soul doth dearly &s;alute thee, with my dear and precious Children, which are dear and precious in the Light of the Lord, to thy endle&s;s Joy, and my everla&s;ting Comfort; Glory be to our Lord God eternally, who hath called you with a holy Calling, and hath cau&s;ed his Beauty to &s;hine upon you, in this the Day of his Power, wherein he is making up of his Jewels, and binding up of his faithful Ones in the Bond of everla&s;ting Love and Salvation, among whom he hath numbred you of his own free Grace; in which I be&s;eech you (dear Hearts) in the Fear of the Lord to abide in your Mea&s;ures, according to the Manife&s;tation of the Revelation of the Son of God, in you; keep a diligent Watch over every Thought, Word, and Action, and let your Minds be &s;taid continually in the Light, where you will find out the Snares and Baits of Satan, and be pre&s;erved out of his Traps, Nets, and Pits, that you may not be captivated by him at his Will. Oh, my dear Husband and Children, how often have I poured out my Soul to our ever|la&s;ting Father for you, with Rivers of Tears, Night and Day, that you might be kept pure and &s;ingle in the Sight of our God, improving your Talents as wi&s;e Vir|gins, having Oil in your Ve&s;&s;els, and your Lamps burning, and cloathed with the long white Robes of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, ready to enter the Bed-chamber, and to &s;up with

<P>My dear Hearts, you do not want teaching, you are in a Land of Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s, which floweth with Milk and Honey, among the faithful Stewards, who&s;e Mouths are opened wide in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, to declare the eternal My&s;teries of the everla&s;ting Kingdom, of the endle&s;s Joys, and eternal Glory; whereinto all the Willing and Obedient &s;hall enter, and be ble&s;&s;ed for ever.</P>
<P>My dear Hearts, the Promi&s;es of the Lord are large, and are all&punc; <HI>Yea</HI> and <HI>Amen</HI> to tho&s;e that fear his Name; he will comfort the Mourners in <HI>Sion,</HI> and will cau&s;e the heavy-hearted in <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to rejoice, becau&s;e of the Glad-ty|dings: They that do bear the Cro&s;s with Patience, &s;hall wear the Crown with Joy; for it is thro' the Long-&s;uffering and patient Waitings, the Crown of Life and Immortality comes to be obtained. The Lord hath exerci&s;ed my Patience, and tried me to the uttermo&s;t, to his Prai&s;e, and my eternal Comfort, who hath not been wanting to us in any Thing in his own due Time; we are Witne&s;&s;es he can provide a Table in the Wilderne&s;s, both &s;piritual and temporal.

<P>In our deepe&s;t Affliction, when I looked for every Breath to be the la&s;t, I could not wi&s;h I had not come over Sea, becau&s;e I knew it was my eternal Father's Will to prove me, with my dear and faithful Friend; in all Afflictions and Mi|&s;eries the Lord remembered Mercy, and did not leave nor for&s;ake us, nor &s;uffer his Faithfulne&s;s to fail us, but cau&s;ed the &s;weet Drops of his Mercy to di&s;til upon us, and the Brightne&s;s of his glorious Countenance to &s;hine into our Hearts, and was never wanting to us in Revelations or Vi&s;ions. Oh, how may I do to &s;et forth the Fulne&s;s of God's Love to our Souls! No Tongue can expre&s;s it, no Heart can conceive it, nor Mind can comprehend it. Oh, the Ravi&s;hments, the Raptures, the glorious bright-&s;hining Countenance of our Lord God, who is our Fulne&s;s in Emptine&s;s, our Strength in Weakne&s;s, our Health in Sickne&s;s, our Life in Death, our Joy in Sorrow, our Peace in Di&s;quietne&s;s, our Prai&s;e in Heavine&s;s, our Power in all Needs or Nece&s;&s;ities; he alone is a full God unto us, and to all that can tru&s;t him; he hath emptied us of our &s;elves, and hath unbottomed us of our &s;elves, and hath wholly built us upon the &s;ure Foundation, the Rock of Ages, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Light of the World, where the &s;welling Seas, nor raging, foam|ing Waves, nor &s;tormy Winds, tho' they beat vehemently, can he able to remove us. Glory, Honour, and Prai&s;e is to our God for ever, who out of his everla&s;ting Trea&s;ures, doth fill us with his eternal Riches Day by Day; he did nouri&s;h our Souls with the choice&s;t of his Mercies, and doth feed our Bodies with his good Crea|tures, and relieve all our Nece&s;&s;ities in a full Mea&s;ure; Prai&s;es, Prai&s;es be to him alone, who is our everla&s;ting Portion, our Confidence, and our Rejoicing, whom we &s;erve acceptably with Reverence and Godly Fear; for our God is a con&s;uming Fire.</P>
<P>Oh, my dear Husband, and precious Children, you may feel the I&s;&s;ues of Love and Life, which &s;tream forth as a River to every Soul of you, from a Heart that is wholly joined to the Fountain! My Prayers are for you Day and Night without cea&s;ing, be&s;eeching the Lord God of Power to pour down his tender Mercies upon you, and to keep you in his pure Fear, and to encrea&s;e your Faith, to confirm you in all Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;trengthen you in believing in the Name of the Lord God Almighty, that you may be e&s;tabli&s;hed as <HI>Mount Sion,</HI> that can never be moved. Keep your Souls un&s;potted of the World, and love one another with a pure Heart fervently, &s;erve one another in Love, build up one another in the eternal, and bear one another's Burdens for the Seed's-Sake, and &s;o fulfil the Law of God. This is the Word of the Lord unto you, my dearly Beloved.</P>
<P>Dear Hearts, I do commit you into the Hands of the Almighty, who dwelleth on high, and to the Word of his Grace in you, who is able to build you up to ever|la&s;ting Life, and eternal Salvation.

<P>The following Letter was written by <HI>Sarah</HI> to her Husband <HI>Henry Cheevers</HI> and Children.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>MY Dear Husband,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sarah</HI>'s Letter to her Hu&s;|band and Children.</NOTE> my Love, my Life is given up to &s;erve the living God, and to obey his pure Call in the Mea&s;ure of the Manife&s;tation of his Love, Light, Life and Spirit of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, his only begotten Son, whom he hath manife&s;ted in me, and thou&s;ands, by the Brightne&s;s of his Appearing, to put an End to Sin and Satan, and bring to Light Immortality, thro' the Preach|ing of the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, by the Spirit of Prophecy, which is poured out upon the Sons and Daughters of the living God, according to his Purpo&s;e; whereof he hath cho&s;en me, who am the lea&s;t of all: But God, who is rich in Mercy, for his own Name-&s;ake hath pa&s;&s;ed by m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne Offences, and hath counted me worthy to bear Te&s;timony to his holy Name, before the mighty Men of the Earth. Oh the Love of the Lord to my Soul! My Tongue cannot expre&s;s, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man, to conceive of the Things that God hath laid up for them that fear him.</P>
<P>Therefore doth my Soul breathe to my God for thee and my Children, Night and Day, that your Minds may be joined to the Light of the Lord Je&s;us, to lead you out of Satan's Kingdom, into the Kingdom of God, where we may enjoy one another in the Life eternal, where neither Sea nor Land can &s;eparate; in which Light and Life do I &s;alute thee my dear Husband, with my Children, wi&s;h|ing you to embrace God's Love, in making his Truth &s;o clearly manife&s;t among&s;t you; whereof I am a Witne&s;s, even of the everla&s;ting Fountain that hath been o|pened by the Me&s;&s;engers of Chri&s;t, who preach to you the Word of God, in Sea&s;on and out of Sea&s;on, directing you where you may find your Saviour to purge and clean&s;e you from your Sins, and to reconcile you to his Father, and to have &V;nity with him and all the Saints, in the Light, that ye may be Fellow-Citizens in the Kingdom of Glory, Re&s;t and Peace, which Chri&s;t hath purcha&s;ed for them that love him, and obey him. What Profit is there for to gain the whole World, and lo&s;e your own Souls? Seek fir&s;t the Kingdom of God and the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s thereof, and all other Things &s;hall be added to you. Godline&s;s is great Gain, having the Promi&s;e of this Life that now is, and that which is to come; which is fulfilled to me, who have ta&s;ted of the Lord's endle&s;s Love and Mercies to my Soul; and from a moving of the &s;ame Love and Life do I breathe to thee my Dear Husband, with my Children; my dear Love &s;alutes you all; my Prayers to my God are for you all, that your Minds may be joined to the Light, wherewith you are lightned, that I may enjoy you in that which is eternal, and have Communion with you in the Spirit. He that is joined to the Lord, is one Spirit, one Heart, one Mind, one Soul, to &s;erve the Lord with one Con&s;ent. I cannot by Pen nor Paper &s;et forth the large Love of God in fulfilling his gra|tious Promi&s;es to me in the Wilderne&s;s, being put into Pri&s;on for God's Truth, there to remain all Days of my Life, being &s;earched, tried, examined upon pain of Death among the Enemies of God and his Truth; &s;tanding in Jeopardy for my Life until the Lord had &s;ubdued and brought them under by his mighty Power, and made them to feed us, and would have given us Money or Clothes; but the Lord did deck our Table richly in the Wilderne&s;s. The Day of the Lord is appearing, wherein he will di&s;cover every Deed of Darkne&s;s, let it be done never &s;o &s;ecretly&punc; the Light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us will make it manife&s;t in every Con&s;cience; the Lord will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ip up all Coverings that are not of his own Spirit.

Several other Letters both &s;he and <HI>Katharine</HI> writ to their Husbands, Friends, and Relations. But &s;ince great Part of my Narrative was fetch'd from thence, I pa&s;s them by. But by the&s;e in&s;erted, one may &s;ee that they were not Women of a dull Temper, but ingenious and chearful.</P>
<P>In a Letter of <HI>Sarah</HI>'s to her Friends in <HI>Ireland,</HI> I find the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><Q>My Life is given up to the Service of the Lord: Bonds, Chains, Bolts, Irons, double Doors, Death it &s;elf is too little for the Te&s;timo|ny of Je&s;us, and for the Word of God; &s;o the Seed be gathered, it is but a rea&s;onable Sacrifice. Bonds and Afflictions be&s;ide the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. Tho&s;e that will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, mu&s;t &s;uffer Per&s;ecu|tion.</Q> And in a Letter to <HI>Daniel Baker, Katharine</HI> &s;aid,</P>
<P><Q>The Time is too little for me to di&s;clo&s;e the twentieth Part of the terrible Trials; but when&s;oever we were brought upon any Trial, the Lord did take away all Fear from us, and multiplied our Strength, and gave us Power and Boldne&s;s to plead for the Truth of the Lord Je&s;us, and Wi&s;dom of Words to &s;top the Mouths of the Gain&s;ayers; but then they would &s;ay, <HI>We had not the true Faith, but we had all Vir|tues.</HI> Dearly beloved, pray for us, that we fall not, nor fail, where|by our Enemies may have any Advantage to rejoice, and &s;ay, we &s;erved a God that could not &s;ave us, and called upon a God that could not deliver us; as if we were like them, to call upon Stocks, Stones, Pictures, and painted Walls, and dead Things, that cannot hear, &s;ee, nor &s;peak. We do be&s;eech thee to tell all our dear Friends, Fathers and Elders, the Pillars of the &s;piritual Building, with all the re&s;t of our Chri&s;tian Brethren, that we do de&s;ire their Prayers, for we have need of them.</Q></P>
<P>This Letter they concluded with the following Poem:</P>
<LG>
<L>HOW &s;trong and pow'rful is our KING,</L>
<L>To all that do believe in him?</L>
<L>He doth pre&s;erve them from the Snare,</L>
<L>And Teeth of tho&s;e that would them tear.</L>

<L>We that are Suff'rers for the Seed,</L>
<L>Our Hearts are wounded, and do bleed,</L>
<L>To &s;ee th' Oppre&s;&s;ion, Cruelty</L>
<L>Of Man that do thy Truth deny.</L>
<L>In Pri&s;ons &s;trong, and Dungeons deep,</L>
<L>To God alone we cry and weep:</L>
<L>Our Sorrows none can learn nor read,</L>
<L>But tho&s;e that in our Bath do tread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But he who&s;e Beauty &s;hineth bright,</L>
<L>Who turneth Darkne&s;s into Light,</L>
<L>Makes Cedars bow, and Oaks to bend</L>
<L>To him, that's &s;ent to the &s;ame End;</L>
<L>He is a Fountain pure and clear,</L>
<L>His Chri&s;tal Streams run far and near,</L>
<L>To clean&s;e all tho&s;e that come to him,</L>
<L>For to be healed of their Sin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All them that patiently abide,</L>
<L>And never &s;werve nor go a&s;ide;</L>
<L>The Lord will free them out of all</L>

<P>This Act cau&s;ed <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> to write a &s;mall Book,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. Burroughs</HI> writes an A|pology for the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and again&s;t Per&s;e|cution.</NOTE> called, <HI>The Ca&s;e of the People called</HI> Quakers <HI>&s;tated,</HI> to &s;hew the Fal&s;hood of the Accu&s;ations charged upon them. Fir&s;t he &s;hewed in this Treati&s;e, that &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Quakers</HI> were Hereticks and erroneous People, which was never yet pro|ved; yet we found no Examples in Scripture that &s;uch &s;hould be im|pri&s;oned, or afflicted with corporal Puni&s;hments. Having treated of this Matter at large, he laid down the State of their Way of Meeting and Wor&s;hip, appealing to others on this Account, with the&s;e Words:</P>
<Q><P>What Judgment do our Neighbours give in this Ca&s;e? they &s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. Burroughs</HI> &s;hews <HI>Qua|kers</HI> Meet|ings are not dangerous.</NOTE> concerning our Meetings, <HI>That they have known us to meet together in &s;uch Manner, for divers Years, in Towns and Villages, and never knew, nor under|&s;tood of any Harm or Danger therein, nor ever were any way prejudiced, ei|ther in their Per&s;ons or E&s;tates, in our Meetings.</HI> The very <HI>Witne&s;s of God</HI> in all our Neighbours does te&s;tify, and give Judgment, that our Meetings have always been peaceable and quiet, and that we come together in Peace and good Order, and parted in the &s;ame, and no Per&s;on hath been harmed by &s;uch our Meetings; enquire of the Neighbourhood, and they will tell you, they believe in their Con|&s;ciences, our Meetings are for Good, and have good Effects, and are not evil, nor bring forth any Evil to any.</P>
<P>And as for the Manner of our meeting and &s;itting together, it is orderly and decently, and of good Report among Men; and for any Doctrine that ever was there held, or heard by any, none can truly accu&s;e it to be either Error, or Here&s;y, or Sedition; but on the contrary, they know it witne&s;&s;eth again&s;t all Sin and Iniquity, and tends to the turning of People from Ungodline&s;s and Unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s, to Truth and Holine&s;s: And many can tell, this is effected, by our Doctrine, preached in our Meetings; and our Neighbours can witne&s;s, that we part again in Peace and good Order, and in con|venient Time; and they can &s;hew you, they are not terrified, nor the Peace of the Land di&s;turbed (on our Part) by our Meetings, which are in God's Fear, and to the Glory of his Name, which all Sober Men know, are according to the Law of God, and Go&s;pel, and primitive Chri&s;tian Example.</P>
<P>We are accu&s;ed as heinous Offenders, and impri&s;oned, becau&s;e 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed, <HI>We do not &s;ubmit to obey the known Laws of the Land, but break them, and will not conform to the Church, pay Tithes, take Oaths, have Meet|ings together,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>tho' we know the Laws of the Land command tho&s;e Things.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="003104_0331_0FEFF60D94D47948"><HI>Plea,</HI> Fir&s;t, As to &s;ubmitting to all known Laws of the Land; this is known to God and our Neighbours, that our Principle and Prac|tice is, and ever hath been, to &s;ubmit to every Government, and to &s;ubmit to all Laws of Men, either by doing or by &s;uffering, as at this Day, we re&s;i&s;t not the greate&s;t of Afflictions and Tribulations that can be impo&s;ed on us; and this is well known to our Neighbours and all People, that we are &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to all Laws of Men, by patient &s;uffering without Re&s;i&s;tance; even when any Law requires any Thing of us which we cannot perform for Con&s;cience-&s;ake, that Law we fulfil by patient Suffering, re&s;i&s;ting no Man, nor rendring Evil for Evil to any. And the Judgment of the Scriptures which are ac|cording to both Law and Go&s;pel, and the Precedents of Saints ju&s;tify us in this Ca&s;e, in chu&s;ing patiently to &s;uffer the greate&s;t Penalties of the Law, rather than to obey (by doing) any &s;uch Law as requires things contrary to our pure Con&s;ciences; as in the Exam|ple of the three Children, <HI>Dan.</HI> 3. who were commanded, <HI>To fall down and wor&s;hip the golden Image, at what Time &s;oever they heard the Sound of the Mu&s;ick, upon the Penalty of being ca&s;t into the mid&s;t of the burn|ing fiery Furnace:</HI> which Commandment they could not obey, nor could they fall down to wor&s;hip the Image; but rather chu&s;ed to &s;uf|fer the Penalty of being ca&s;t into the mid&s;t of the burning fiery Fur|nace, which accordingly was done unto them. Again, in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Daniel,</HI> chap. 6. who was commanded, <HI>To make no Petition to any God or Man for thirty Days, &s;ave to King</HI> Darius, <HI>upon the Penalty and Affliction of being ca&s;t into the Lyon's Den:</HI> But <HI>Daniel</HI> did rather chu&s;e to &s;uffer the Penalty, to be ca&s;t into the Den of Lyons, than to obey the Command|ment; and was ca&s;t into the Lion's Den. By the&s;e Examples of holy Men, with many more that might be given out of the Scriptures, 'tis evi|dent, <HI>That righteous Men will rather chu&s;e to &s;uffer, than to obey any Law of Man contrary to their Con&s;ciences.</HI> So the Law of God, and Exam|ple of Saints, and holy Scriptures give Judgment for us in this Ca&s;e, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ather chu&s;ing to &s;uffer, than to obey Laws contrary to our Con|&s;ciences; and con&s;equently mu&s;t needs condemn &s;uch that per&s;ecute and impri&s;on us, becau&s;e they require Obedience of us in Things again&s;t our Con&s;ciences.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Tho' we di&s;obey Laws, and cannot actively obey every Law of Man, when it requireth and commandeth Things contrary to a good Con&s;cience, yet herein al&s;o are we ju&s;tified, by the Law of God, Example of Saints, and holy Scriptures, and they give Judgment for us, and con&s;equently again&s;t our Enemies in this Ca&s;e; and in par|ticular in the two Examples before-mentioned in <HI>Daniel,</HI> the three Children were expre&s;ly commanded, <HI>to fall down and wor&s;hip the golden Image;</HI> and <HI>Daniel</HI> was al&s;o required by the King's Decree, <HI>Not to pray to any God or Man, &s;ave to King</HI> Darius; yet all the&s;e holy Men of God did ab&s;olutely di&s;obey the Law and Decree &s;o requiring of them, and did contrary to the Commandment; for the three Children did not bow, nor <HI>Daniel</HI> cea&s;e to pray to God, but prayed as at other Times, and yet were ju&s;tified of God in &s;o doing. Al&s;o, the Apo&s;tles of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t (<HI>Acts</HI> 4.18.) were commanded, <HI>to preach no more in the Name of Je&s;us;</HI> but the Apo&s;tles did di&s;obey their Com|mandment, and went on and preached in the Spirit and Power of Chri&s;t, contrary to the Commandment of the Rulers, and appealed to them, <HI>Whether it were not bet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er to obey God than Man?</HI> Many Exam|ples we might collect out of the Scriptures, that the Servants of God did di&s;obey the Commands of Kings and Rulers, and could not obey (by doing) any Command contrary to God; but rather choo&s;ed to &s;uffer Afflictions, and Death it &s;elf, than to obey &s;uch Laws and Decrees,
<PB N="321" REF="003104_0332_0FEFF64B0809ADA0">
as required any Thing contrary to a pure Con&s;cience: And this is our Ca&s;e at this Day; we cannot obey (by doing) any Thing again&s;t our Con&s;ciences, but mu&s;t break the Laws of Men, and di&s;obey their Commandments, rather than break the Law of God, and &s;in again&s;t our own Con&s;ciences, what&s;oever we &s;uffer becau&s;e hereof; and yet the Examples of Saints and Scriptures ju&s;tify us in this Behalf.</P>
<P>And let all our Enemies cea&s;e to cry out, <HI>Rebellious and di&s;obedient to Laws and Government;</HI> for we are not &s;uch as do wilfully and ob&s;ti|nately di&s;obey any Laws of Men, but for Con&s;cience-&s;ake, and that we may not &s;in again&s;t God, nor offend his Witne&s;s in us; therefore we cannot obey Laws contrary to our Con&s;ciences, what&s;oever we &s;uf|fer, which we re&s;i&s;t not, nor rebel again&s;t any in this Ca&s;e: So that our Principles and Practices are to obey every Law and Government, ei|ther by doing, or &s;uffering. And tho' we di&s;obey &s;uch Laws as are not according to the Law of God, and rather do chu&s;e to &s;uffer, yet herein we are ju&s;tified by the Law of God, and the holy Scriptures.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> And as for our Conver&s;ations among Men, in Re&s;pect of our daily Walking and Conver&s;e with them in our Dealing, in Re&s;pect of Hone&s;ty, and Faithfulne&s;s, and Truth, and Ju&s;tne&s;s in Works and Words, our Neighbours &s;hall give, Witne&s;s for us: We will not ju&s;tify our &s;elves, 'tis God that ju&s;tifies us, and the Law of God, Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, Scriptures, Examples of holy Men, our Neighbours, and the Witne&s;s of God in all Mens Con&s;ciences, &s;hall bear Witne&s;s to us; and all the&s;e do give Judgment for us in the&s;e Ca&s;es, to whom we do appeal for Judgment. And, <HI>O Lord God everla&s;ting, do thou judge our Cau&s;e; do thou make it manife&s;t in thy due Sea&s;on to all the World, that we are thy People, that we love thee above all, that we fear thy Name more than all, that we love Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and hate Iniquity, and that we now &s;uffer for thy holy Name and Truth, and for thy Honour and Ju&s;tice, and for thy Truth and Holine&s;s: O Lord, thou knowe&s;t we are re&s;olved to peri&s;h, rather than to lo&s;e one Grain hereof.</HI> Amen, Amen.</P>
<P>Our Accu&s;ations and An&s;wers truly compared, and weighed in the Balance of Ju&s;tice and Truth in every Man's Con&s;cience, let all the World judge of the Ca&s;e: Do we de&s;erve to be ruin'd, de&s;troy'd, im|pri&s;on'd, and bani&s;h'd, and that to be devour'd of wild Bea&s;ts, as our Enemy threatens us he will do? Is it &s;o? Are we Hereticks? Are we &s;editious? Are we Drunkards? Are we Double-dealers? Are we &s;uch as the Law of God condemns? What Evil have we done in the Land? Do we hurt any Body? Are we not innocent before the Lord and Men? We appeal to the ju&s;t Witne&s;s of God and Men, let it be an&s;wered; and tho' no Man will hear and con&s;ider our Cau&s;e this Day, yet the Lord will plead our Cau&s;e in his Time and Sea&s;on, and make the World to know, <HI>We are his People;</HI> in the mean Time we are willing to &s;uffer the Reproaches of ungodly Men, till the Lord works Deli|verance in the Earth.</P>
<P>But now it may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> objected by the Magi&s;trates and Rulers, <HI>That we have now a Law again&s;t you, and you mu&s;t &s;uffer, for we cannot but put the Law in Execution, according to our Oaths and Offices; and it is not we that per&s;ecute you, but it is the Law of the Land by which you now &s;uffer; and we cannot be blamed for your Suffering, we only execute the Law.</HI> And after this Manner is the Rea&s;oning of &s;ome at this Day, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> To all which I do an&s;wer: It is true, there is a Law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> enacted again&s;t us, which is pretendedly made the Ground of our Suf|fering; but whether that Law be in it &s;elf ju&s;t, or unju&s;t, I &s;hall not now demon&s;trate, but &s;hall leave it to the Judgment of all Chri&s;tian Men that know us, our Principles, Doctrines, Ways, and Conver&s;a|tions, and let them judge whether we de&s;erve the Penalties and Pu|ni&s;hments,
<PB N="322" REF="003104_0333_0FEFF60FEE23C868">
therein de&s;crib'd, for any Principle or Practice hold or main|tained by us. And tho' there be a Law again&s;t us, yet the Magi&s;trates that are Executors thereof, may execute the &s;ame with Moderation or with Violence, with Di&s;cretion or too much Rigour; and it will be well for them to u&s;e Moderation and Di&s;cretion in this Ca&s;e: Hereby may they &s;ave them&s;elves from that Weight of Anger and Indignation of the Lord God, that will come upon all violent Doers, who &s;eek to de&s;troy the Innocent, and rejoice in the Occa&s;ion admini&s;tred.</P>
<P>And tho' this Law be enacted again&s;t Meetings, not ours, I may &s;ay; but &s;uch Meetings as are dangerous to the publick Peace, and to the Terror of the People: But our Meetings are not &s;uch, and there|fore this Law may not ju&s;tly extend in its Execution to the Breaking of our Meetings, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to bani&s;h us becau&s;e of our meeting together, which is for the Wor&s;hip of God, and are peaceable and of good Report among all good Men; and are not for Di&s;turbance of the Peace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Terror of the People, and therefore ju&s;tly free from this Law, as afore|&s;aid.</P>
<P>And tho' this Law is pretended again&s;t us, for to bani&s;h us, and to rid the Land of us, as &s;ome vainly &s;uppo&s;e; yet, mu&s;t it needs be executed to the Height of it without Limitation or Re&s;triction? Mu&s;t this Law be executed to its Height more than &s;ome other Laws, that are as truly enacted, and as fully in Force as this Act can be? Yet &s;ome &s;uch Laws there are, which better de&s;erve Execution than this, yet they lie <HI>dormant,</HI> as is vi&s;ibly apparent at this Day, as in 4 <HI>Jac.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.5. in the&s;e Words: <HI>Be it enacted,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>That all, and every Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, which after forty Days next following the End of this pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, &s;hall be drunk, and of the &s;ame Offence of Drunkenne&s;s &s;hall be lawfully convicted, &s;hall for every &s;uch Offence forfeit and lo&s;e five &s;hilings,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>to be paid to the Hands of the Churchwardens of that Pari&s;h where the Offence &s;hall be committed, who &s;hall be accountable therefore to the &V;&s;e of the Poor of the &s;ame Pari&s;h.

Divers other Laws and Statutes made for good Ends, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of Wickedne&s;s in the Land, there are, which are but ea&s;ily executed at this Day: But here is one Act again&s;t peaceable meeting together for the Wor&s;hip of God, which is violently pro&s;ecuted and executed upon innocent Men; and let all ju&s;t Man judge of the&s;e Things: Tho' there be a Law enacted again&s;t our Meetings, &s;o there is again&s;t Drunkards and Drunkenne&s;s, and un&s;ea|&s;onable Tippling in Taverns and Alehou&s;es; and again&s;t Min&s;trels Fidlers, Pipers and Players, Common Players and Stage-Players, that go up and down the Countries, and have their Play-hou&s;es in publick Cities; which Statutes ought rather to be executed, tho' they are not: But the&s;e Things we &s;hall leave to all &s;ober People to judge of.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing that the Law again&s;t us is more put in Execution, than the&s;e other Laws, it doth appear, That there is more Envy again&s;t us, and our peaceable religious Meetings, than there is again&s;t Prophane|ne&s;s and Wickedne&s;s, Drunkenne&s;s and Stage-playing, and &s;uch like; and &s;uch Magi&s;trates, where&s;oever they are, are not excu&s;able in the Sight of God, tho' there is a Law again&s;t us, while they pro&s;ecute it again&s;t us, and not the&s;e other good Laws again&s;t prophane and un|godly Per&s;ons and Practices: And therefore &s;eeing we do &s;uffer, we mu&s;t &s;ay, <HI>It is not only becau&s;e there is a Law again&s;t us;</HI> but it is al&s;o, or rather, <HI>Becau&s;e there is Enmity, and Wrath, and Wickedne&s;s in the Hearts of Men again&s;t us,</HI> which is the main Cau&s;e of our Sufferings at this Day.</P></Q>

<P>Cruel indeed was this Order; becau&s;e to whip the&s;e three tender Women thro' eleven Towns, with Ten Stripes a-piece at each Place, thro' a length of near eighty Miles, in bitter cold Weather, would have been enough to have beaten their Bones bare, and their Lives out of their Bodies.</P>
<P>Now in a very cold Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sentence executed at <HI>Dover,</HI> the Prie&s;t looking on and laugh|ing.</NOTE> the Deputy <HI>Walden at Dover,</HI> cau&s;ed the&s;e Women to be &s;tripp'd naked from the Middle upward, and tied to a Cart, and then whipt them, while the Prie&s;t look'd on and laugh'd at it; which &s;ome of their Friends &s;eeing, and taking Notice of <HI>Walden</HI>'s Cruelty, te&s;tified again&s;t; for which <HI>Walden</HI> put two of them in the Stocks.</P>

<P>The&s;e three Women being thus unexpectedly relea&s;ed, went to <HI>New Quechawanah,</HI> where they had a Meeting, and <HI>Shubal Drummer</HI> the Prie&s;t of the Place, came al&s;o thither, and &s;at quiet. And the Meeting being ended, he &s;tood up, and &s;aid, <HI>Good Women, ye have &s;poken well, and pray|ed well; pray what is your Rule?</HI> They an&s;wering, <HI>The Spirit of God is our Rule, and it ought to be thine and all Mens to walk by.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prie&s;t <HI>Drum|mer</HI>'s ra&s;h Ex|pre&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> He replied, <HI>It is not my Rule, nor I hope ever &s;hall be.</HI> A clear Evidence how Prejudice may bia&s;s even di&s;creet People; for being prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed thereby, Men will &s;peak &s;ometimes ra&s;hly, without con&s;idering what.</P>
<P>Not long after, the&s;e Women returned to <HI>Dover,</HI> to vi&s;it their Friends; and being in a Meeting the next Fir&s;t-day of the Week, the Con&s;tables, <HI>Thomas Roberts,</HI> and his Brother <HI>John,</HI> ru&s;hed in, and laid Hands on <HI>Alice Ambro&s;e</HI> as &s;he was in Prayer, and taking her, one by the one Arm, and the other by the other, they dragg'd her out of Doors, almo&s;t a Mile, with her Face towards the Snow, which was near Knee deep, over Stumps and old Trees, having put on their old Clothes, on purpo&s;e not to dirty their better Suits.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are a|gain &s;eized at <HI>Dover,</HI> and dragg'd about in a barbarous Manner.</NOTE> Then they lock'd her up in a certain Hou&s;e, and &s;o went back to fetch <HI>Mary Tomkins,</HI> whom they dragg'd in the &s;ame Manner; which their Father, old <HI>Thomas Roberts</HI> &s;eeing, lamented, and cry'd, <HI>Wo that ever I was Father to &s;uch wicked Children.</HI> But they &s;eem'd not to matter what their Father &s;aid, who had been a Member of the Church at <HI>Dover</HI> above twenty Years; but becau&s;e he no longer frequented their Wor&s;hip for their Degeneracy, they took away his Cow, which, with its Milk, helpt to &s;upport him and his Wife. <HI>Mary Tomkins</HI> being brought into the Hou&s;e where <HI>Alice</HI> was, <HI>Anne Coleman,</HI> was al&s;o fetch'd. Next Morning they got a Canoe, and threatned the Women, <HI>They would now do with them, that they &s;hould be troubled with them no more;</HI> by which Saying, they &s;eem'd to &s;ignify, that they would give them up to the Mercy of the Sea; which made the Women unwilling to go to the Water-&s;ide. Then one <HI>Edward Weymouth</HI> took <HI>Mary</HI> by the Arms, and dragg'd her on her Back over the Stumps of Trees, down a very &s;teep Hill; by which &s;he was much brui&s;ed, and often dyed away.

They al&s;o laid hold on <HI>Alice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">At the In&s;ti|gation of <HI>Hate-evil Nutwel</HI> a ru|ling Elder.</NOTE> whom they pluck'd violently into the Wa|ter, and kept her &s;wimming by the Canoe, &s;o that &s;he was in Danger of being drowned, or frozen to Death. <HI>Anne Coleman</HI> was likewi&s;e rudely dealt with, and all this in the Pre&s;ence of one <HI>Hate-evil Nutwel,</HI> a ruling Elder, who &s;tirr'd up the Con&s;tables to this wicked Action, and &s;o &s;hew'd that he bore a wrong Name.

But he denying the Fact, the Execution was deferred; and in the mean while the Prie&s;ts <HI>John Wil&s;on,</HI> and <HI>James Mayo</HI> came to him in Pri&s;on, to &s;ee what they could get out of him; and <HI>Mayo</HI> told him, <HI>His Time was near at an End, and that he mu&s;t &s;hortly die; and therefore he would have him now to confe&s;s.</HI> To which the Pri&s;oner returned, <HI>What will you have me to confe&s;s, that which I never did?</HI> But <HI>Mayo</HI> did not de&s;i&s;t, but &s;aid, <HI>Confe&s;s my Son, and give Glory to God.</HI> Yet the Pri&s;oner continued in denying the Charge, and affirmed, he was <HI>clear.</HI> But &s;aid the Prie&s;t, <HI>You cannot be clear,</HI> for our Lord and Saviour &s;aith, <HI>Who&s;oever looketh up|on a fair Woman, and lu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth after her, he hath committed Adultery with her already in his Heart.</HI> Truly a very perver&s;e U&s;e of the Scripture, for

compa&s;&s;ing a fal&s;e End. But the <HI>Dutchman</HI> &s;eeing how they came to betray him, was cautious; and at length after a long and tedious Im|pri&s;onment, found Means to break Pri&s;on, and thus e&s;caped from tho&s;e who grew accu&s;tomed to be mercile&s;s; &s;o that &s;ometimes others as well as <HI>Quakers,</HI> felt the Weight of their Severity.</P>
<P>As it happened,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E.

And Information being given that the&s;e People did &s;ometimes &s;hew Love to tho&s;e they called <HI>cur&s;ed Quakers,</HI> they were all three fetch'd from their Habitation at <HI>Salem,</HI> and carried to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and were tried for their Lives, meerly on Su&s;picion; but nothing of Murder was proved again&s;t them; yet the Mother was fined a great Sum, and her two Sons were &s;entenced to &s;tand under the Gallows certain Hours, with Ropes about their Necks, and to be whipt in the Market-place, which was performed accordingly. And becau&s;e the&s;e young Men were not daunted, Prie&s;t <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> &s;tanding by, &s;aid, <HI>Ah cur&s;ed Generation.</HI> And at <HI>Salem</HI> they were whipt al&s;o, which was done &s;o mercile&s;ly, that one of the young Men &s;unk down, or died away under the Torture, tho' he was rai&s;ed up, and came to Life again.</P>
<P>By this we may &s;ee how the&s;e <HI>New-England</HI> Per&s;ecutors were become inured to exce&s;&s;ive Severity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Deaths of &s;ome of <HI>New-England</HI> Per|&s;ecutors.</NOTE> But before I leave them, I mu&s;t al&s;o men|tion the dreadful Exit of &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Act of Governor <HI>Endicot</HI>'s bloody Part was the cruel Whip|ping of <HI>Edward Wharton</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Governor <HI>Endicot.</HI></NOTE> related before: For the Time was now come that he mu&s;t go off the Stage, to give an Account of his extravagant Severity before another Tribunal than that of his &s;an|guinary Court.

<P>Yet more remarkable was the Death of Major General <HI>Adderton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">General <HI>Ad|derton.</HI></NOTE> who when <HI>Mary Dyar</HI> was hang'd, &s;aid &s;coffingly, and in an in&s;ulting Way, <HI>That &s;he hung as a Flag, for others to take Example by;</HI> and who al&s;o, when <HI>Wenlock Chri&s;ti&s;on</HI> being condemned to Death, warned the Per&s;ecutors becau&s;e of the righteous Judgments of God, pre&s;umptuou&s;ly &s;aid, <HI>You pronounce Woes and Judgments, and tho&s;e that are gone before you, pronounced Woes and Judgments; but the Judgments of the Lord God are not come upon us as yet.</HI> But how he him&s;elf was &s;truck by the&s;e Judg|ments, and &s;erved for an Example to others, we are to &s;ee now.</P>
<P>He upon a certain Day having exerci&s;ed his Soldiers, and riding proudly on his Hor&s;e towards his Hou&s;e, when he came about the Place where u&s;ually they loo&s;ed the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, from the Cart, after they had whipped them, a Cow came and cro&s;&s;ed the Way, at which his Hor&s;e taking a Fright, threw him down &s;o violently, that he died, his Eyes being &s;tarted out of his Head, his Brains out of his No&s;e, his Tongue out of his Mouth, and his Blood out of his Ears. Thus God's Judgments came upon him &s;uddenly, and at unawares.</P>
<P>And <HI>John Norton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J. Norton</HI> chief Prie&s;t.</NOTE> the Chief Prie&s;t of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> died likewi&s;e on a &s;ud|den.

More Ex|amples of this Nature I could produce, but the&s;e may &s;uffice.</P>
<P>What I have related ot the&s;e Cruelties, and much more, was pub|li&s;hed in Print about that Time, that &s;o the King and Parliament of <HI>England</HI> might know what happened there. For tho&s;e Actions were done in publick View, and known there, all about the Country. All that they did, was to &s;et a fal&s;e Colour upon their Severity, and to di&s;|gui&s;e Matters: And i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was their Happine&s;s, that they had not to do with revengeful People, el&s;e they might have been involved in great Streights: But the Friends of the Per&s;ecuted committed Vengeance to God, tho' &s;ome of the Great Ones in <HI>England</HI> advi&s;ed them to &s;ue the Per&s;ecutors, which according to Law they might have done.</P>
<P><HI>Richard Bellingham,</HI> a fierce Per&s;ecutor, and Governor, after <HI>John En|dicot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R.

Not long before, <HI>William Coddington,</HI> Governor of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> writ a Letter to him, wherein he put him in Mind of the former Times; for he, (the &s;aid <HI>Coddington)</HI> had been one of the fir&s;t Erectors of Colonies in <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> and the fir&s;t that built an Hou&s;e in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and afterwards was a Magi&s;trate &s;even Years; but when Per&s;ecution aro&s;e, he declared again&s;t it; and the Ca&s;e was debated for three Days in the Court; but the mo|derate Party was the weake&s;t, and was oppo&s;ed by all the Prie&s;ts, ex|cept one <HI>John Cotton,</HI> who &s;aid, he remembred, how at their Departure from <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J.

Now tho' <HI>Coddington</HI> was one of the greate&s;t Mer|chants, or Traders in that Country, and in all Probability might have acquired great Riches there; yet &s;eeing his good Coun&s;el was not heark|ned to, he re&s;olved to depart that Place, and go and live &s;omewhere el&s;e. But whatever he &s;aid in his Letter to <HI>Bellingham,</HI> this Man re|mained hardned, like <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> having &s;hewed him&s;elf cruel, even when <HI>Mary Fi&s;her</HI> and <HI>Anne Au&s;tin</HI> fir&s;t came to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> where he treated them in a barbarous Manner.</P>
<P>Yet one Thing remarkable I may mention here, which when I fir&s;t: heard, I could not fully give Credit to; but thinking it worth the while to make a narrow Enquiry into it, I did &s;o, not only by Writing, but al&s;o from the Mouths of Per&s;ons that had been Eye-witne&s;&s;es, or had been informed by &s;uch; and from the&s;e I got this concurring Informa|tion, <HI>viz.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Country for many Miles about <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> will now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ield no Wheat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> formerly very fertile.</NOTE> That the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> about <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> was formerly a very fruitful Soil, that produc'd excel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Wheat; but that &s;ince the Time this Town had been &s;tained with the Blood of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, no Wheat, &amp;c. would grow to Perfection within many Miles, tho' the Ground had been plowed and &s;own &s;everal Times: For the very next Harve&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Year 1660, after they had &s;o barbarou&s;ly and unchri&s;tian-like put the <HI>Quakers</HI> to Death, the Bla&s;t was &s;ent upon their Wheat, &s;o that it &s;tank upon the Ground, and would never grow &s;ince, near <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> to be worth the Seed, and Labour of plowing and &s;owing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o that they were forc'd to be content with <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, and &s;uch other Grain as would

<P>In the I&s;land of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> tho&s;e called <HI>Quakers</HI> &s;uffered al&s;o much by the People, in&s;tigated not a little by the Prie&s;ts, <HI>Samuel Graves, Mat|thew Gray, Thomas Manwaring,</HI> and <HI>Francis Smith;</HI> for the&s;e being often drunk,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T.

This puts me in Mind of what I heard my Mother, <HI>Judith Zin&s;penning</HI> &s;ay, who in the Year next following, being gone for <HI>England,</HI> with <HI>William Caton</HI> and his Wife, who liv'd at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> to vi&s;it her Friends there, and coming to <HI>London,</HI> went with others to the <HI>Bull</HI> and <HI>Mouth</HI> Meeting; but Entrance being denied, they &s;tay'd in the Street, where &s;he &s;aw one Preacher after another, pull'd down, at the In&s;tant Cry of &s;ome Officer or other, <HI>Con&s;table, take him away.</HI> Several being thus led away, the Con&s;table came al&s;o to her, and perceiving by her Dre&s;s that &s;he was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Woman, pull'd her by the Sleeve, and &s;aid with Admiration, <HI>What, a</HI> Dutch <HI>Quaker!</HI> but meddled no farther with her. This keeping of Meetings in the Streets became now a Cu&s;tomary Thing in <HI>England;</HI> for the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, were per&s;uaded that the Exer|ci&s;e of their publick Wor&s;hip was a Duty no Man could di&s;charge them from,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Accounting publick Wor|&s;hip an indi&s;|pen&s;able Du|ty.</NOTE> and they believed that God required the performing of this Ser|vice from their Hands. And by thus meeting in the Streets, it hap|pened &s;ometimes that more than one, nay, it may be three or four at a Time, did preach, one in one Place, and another in another, which in their Meeting-places could not have been done conveniently. But thus they got abundance of Auditors, and among the&s;e &s;ometimes emi|nent Men, who pa&s;&s;ing by in their Coaches, made their Coachmen &s;top. At this Rate they found there was a great Harve&s;t, and thus their Church increa&s;ed under Sufferings; and in tho&s;e &s;harp Times they were pretty well purified of Dro&s;s, &s;ince the Trial was too hot for &s;uch as were not &s;incere; for by frequenting their Meetings in &s;uch a Time, one was in Danger of being either impri&s;oned, or beaten lame, or unto Death: But this could not quench the Zeal of the Upright.</P>
<P>Now the taking away of one Preacher,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As one Prea|cher's taken away, another &s;tands up; e|ven Women, and &s;ome|times Boys.</NOTE> and the &s;tanding up of ano|ther, became an ordinary Thing in <HI>England,</HI> and it la&s;ted yet long after, as I my &s;elf have been an Eye-witne&s;s of there. And when there were no more Men-preachers pre&s;ent, it may be, a Woman would ri&s;e, and mini&s;ter to the Meeting; nay, there were &s;uch who in Years being little more than Boys, were endued with a manly Zeal, and encouraged their Friends to Stedfa&s;tne&s;s. In the mean while, many al&s;o were impri&s;oned, without being haled out of their Meetings; for &s;ome have been appre|hended for &s;peaking only &s;omething on the Behalf of their Friends, as <HI>Rebecca Travers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rebecca Travers</HI> im|pri&s;oned.</NOTE> who going to the Lieutenant of the <HI>Tower,</HI> de&s;ired him to have Compa&s;&s;ion on &s;ome who were impri&s;oned for frequenting of Meetings. But he grew angry at this; and when &s;he went away, one of the Keepers gave her ill Language: On which, &s;he exhorting him, <HI>to be good in his Place, whil&s;t it was the Lord's Will he had it,</HI> he was &s;o offend|ed, that going back to the Lieutenant, he complained that &s;he had &s;po|ken Trea&s;on, and thereupon &s;he was apprehended, and &s;ent to Pri&s;on. Nay, the rude Soldiers were encouraged to Cruelty by Officers who were not a Whit better, for they them&s;elves would &s;ometimes lay vio|lent Hands on peaceable People; as among&s;t the re&s;t the aforemention'd Alderman <HI>Richard Brown,</HI> who formerly had been a Major General un|der <HI>Cromwel,</HI> and now behaved him&s;elf with &s;uch outrageous Fiercene&s;s, that even the Comedians did not &s;tick to expo&s;e him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Relation of Alderman <HI>Brown</HI>'s Cru|elties publi&s;h|ed, and pre|&s;ented to the Mayor and Sheriffs.</NOTE> by an Allu&s;ion to his Name <HI>Brown,</HI> and &s;aying, <HI>The Devil was brown.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="342" REF="003104_0353_0FEFF6AE74C65C58">Once it happened that a Pri&s;oner, who had been a Soldier formerly under <HI>Brown,</HI> &s;eeing that no Ju&s;tice or Equity was ob&s;erved, called to him &s;aying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Pri&s;oner boldly charges <HI>Brown</HI> on the Bench with Murder which he denies not.</NOTE> <HI>That he was not fit to &s;it on the Bench; for he made the Son to hang the Father at</HI> Abingdon; <HI>&s;o that he could prove him to be a Murderer.</HI> This bold Saying cau&s;ed &s;ome Di&s;turbance in the Court, and <HI>Brown,</HI> how heavy &s;oever the Charge was, did not deny the Thing in Court, nor clear him&s;elf from it: Yet the other <HI>Quaker</HI> Pri&s;oners did not ap|prove this Upbraiding, but &s;ignified, <Q>That tho' the Fact were true, yet they were not for reproaching any Magi&s;trate upon the Bench, who&s;e Place and Office they did re&s;pect and honour.</Q> But I don't find that <HI>Brown</HI> (on that Account) ever pro&s;ecuted him that &s;poke &s;o boldly, altho' otherwi&s;e he did whatever he would, without fearing that his Fellow-Magi&s;trates, who re&s;pected him that was a Favourite at Court, would di&s;claim it, as may appear by this following In&s;tance.</P>

And while I was waiting out of all vi&s;ible Things, and quite out of the World in my Spirit, and my Heart upon nothing but the living God, the Lord opened the Springs of the great Deep, and overflowed my whole Heart with Life and Love; and my Eyes were as a Fountain, becau&s;e of Tears of Joy, becau&s;e of his Heritage, of whom he &s;hewed me and &s;aid unto me in a full, fre&s;h, living Power, and a holy, full Te&s;timony, &s;o that my Heart was ravi&s;hed there with Joy un|&s;peakable, and I was out of this Body with God, in his heavenly Paradi&s;e, where I &s;aw and felt Things unutterable, and beyond all Demon&s;tration or Speech.

<P>That this Writing of <HI>F.

For how furious &s;oever their Enemies were, yet they were re|&s;olved to continue faithful in Supplications and fervent Prayers to God, that he might be plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their upright Zeal, who aim'd

at nothing for Self, but from a true Fear and Reverence before him, dur&s;t not omit their Religious A&s;&s;emblies. And they found that the Lord heard their Prayers, in&s;omuch that I remember to have heard one &s;ay, that at a Meeting where they &s;eemed to be in Danger of Death from their fierce Per&s;ecutors, he was as it were ravi&s;hed, &s;o that he hardly knew whether he was in or out of the Body. They then per&s;e|vering thus in Faithfulne&s;s to what they believed the Lord required of them, in Proce&s;s of Time, when their Enemies had taken &s;uch Mea|&s;ures that they were per&s;waded they had found out &s;uch Means, by which they &s;hould &s;uppre&s;s and extingui&s;h the <HI>Quakers,</HI> they &s;aw the Lord God Almighty ro&s;e up in their Defence, and qua&s;h'd and confound|ed the wicked Devices of their cruel Per&s;ecutors, as will be &s;een in the Cour&s;e of this Hi&s;tory.</P>

The Pri&s;oners not think|ing it convenient to make more Exceptions, the Jury were &s;worn. Then two Witne&s;&s;es were called, who te&s;tify'd at mo&s;t, that in &s;uch a Place they took &s;uch Per&s;ons met together, who&s;e Names were &s;pecified in Writing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their An&s;wer.</NOTE> Then the Pri&s;oners bid the Jury, <Q>Take heed how they did &s;port or dally with holy Things, and that tho&s;e Things, which concern|ed the Con&s;cience, were holy Things. And as a Man was not to &s;port with the Health or Illne&s;s of his Neighbour, &s;o he was not to &s;port with the Liberty or the Bani&s;hment of his Neighbour.

Neither were they &s;editious, but peaceable. And whereas they were charged for not coming to hear the <HI>Common-prayer,</HI> this was incongruous; for the <HI>Ser|vice-Book</HI> was not quite printed &s;everal Weeks after the &s;aid 29th of <HI>June;</HI> &s;o that they could not be charged of neglecting to hear that which was not to be heard read any where.</Q> This puzzled the Court not a little; and other pinching Rea&s;ons were al&s;o given by the Pri&s;on|ers, &s;ome of which were Men of Learning; in&s;omuch that the Judge was not able to an&s;wer the Objections but by Shifts and Eva&s;ions.

<P><HI>Reader,</HI> I here give thee a brief Account of my Taking and Impri|&s;oning, that thou may'&s;t the better judge what Ju&s;tice I had from the Court afore&s;aid; which is as followeth;</P>
<P>I being in <HI>John's Street, London,</HI> about the thirteenth Day of the third Month (called <HI>May</HI>) with &s;ome of the People of God, to wait upon him, as we were &s;ate together, there came in a rude Man (called <HI>Miller</HI>) with a long Cane in his Hand, who laid violent Hands upon me, with &s;ome others, beating &s;ome, commanding the Con&s;tables who came in after him, but having no Warrant, were not willing to meddle, but as his Threatnings prevailed, they being afraid of him, joyned with him to carry &s;everal of us before Ju&s;tice <HI>Powel</HI> (&s;o called) who the next Day &s;ent us to the Se&s;&s;ions at <HI>Hick's-Hall;</HI> where after &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e &s;everal Times with them, manife&s;ting to them the Ille|gality both of our Commitment, and their Proceedings thereupon; yet notwith&s;tanding, they committed me and others, and cau&s;ed an Indict|ment to be drawn again&s;t us, founded upon the late Act again&s;t <HI>Quakers and others,</HI> and then remanded us to <HI>New-Pri&s;on,</HI> where we continued for &s;ome Days, and then removed us to <HI>Newgate,</HI> where we remained un|til the Se&s;&s;ions in the <HI>Old Bailey</HI> afore&s;aid: Whereby thou may'&s;t under|&s;tand what Ju&s;tice I met withal, by what went before, and now farther follows.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chief Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>We &s;it here to do Ju&s;tice, and are upon our Oaths; and we are to tell you what is Law, and not you us: Therefore, Sirrah, you are too bold.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Crook.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sirrah is not a Word becoming a Judge; for I am no Felon; neither ought you to menace the Pri&s;oner at the Bar: For I &s;tand here arraigned as for my Life and Liberty, and the Pre&s;ervation of my Wife and Children, and outward E&s;tate, [they being now at the Stake] there|fore you ought to hear me to the full, what I can &s;ay in my own De|fence, according to Law, and that in its Sea&s;on, as it is given me to &s;peak: Therefore I hope the Court will bear with me, if I am bold to a&s;&s;ert my Liberty, as an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and as a Chri&s;tian; and if I &s;peak loud, it is my Zeal for the Truth, and for the Name of the Lord; and mine Innocency makes me bold&mdash;</P>

<P>Then the Judge interrupted me, &s;aying, <HI>Sirrah,</HI> with &s;ome other Words I do not remember: But I an&s;wered, You are not to threaten me, neither are tho&s;e Menaces fit for the Mouth of a Judge; for the Safety of the Pri&s;oner &s;tands upon the Indifferency of the Court: And you ought not to behave your &s;elves as Parties, &s;eeking all Advantages again&s;t the Pri&s;oner, but not heeding any Thing that may make for his Clearing or Advantage.&mdash; The Judge again interrupted me, &s;aying,</P>

<P>Let me &s;ee mine Accu&s;er, that I may know for what Cau&s;e I have been &s;ix Weeks impri&s;oned, and do not put me to accu&s;e my &s;elf, by asking me Que&s;tions; but either let my Accu&s;er come forth, or o|therwi&s;e let me be di&s;charged by Proclamation, as you ought to do.&mdash; Here I was interrupted again.</P>

<SP>

<P>I am here at your Bar as a Pri&s;oner, re&s;trained of my Liberty, and do que&s;tion whether you ought in Ju&s;tice to tender me the Oath on the Account I am now brought before you, becau&s;e I am &s;uppo&s;ed to be an Offender; or el&s;e why have I been &s;ix Weeks in Pri&s;on alrea|dy?

<P><HI>We do ask you again, whether you will take the Oath of Allegiance? It is but a &s;hort Que&s;tion, you may an&s;wer if you will.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>By what Law have you. Power to tender it? Then after &s;ome Con&s;ultation together by Whi&s;pering, they called for the Statute-Book, and turning over the Leaves, they an&s;wered,</P>

<P><HI>By the Third of King</HI> James.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Then they took the Statute-Book, and con&s;ulted together up|on it, and one &s;aid, <HI>We are the Judges of this Land, and do better under&s;tand our Power than you do, and we do judge we may lawfully do it.</HI></P>

<P>Then there was a Cry in the Court, <HI>Take him away,</HI> which occa&s;ion|ed a great Interruption; and <HI>J.

<P><HI>There is no great Matter of Law in the Ca&s;e, it is only Matter of Fact, Whether you have refu&s;ed to take the Oath or not, that is the Point in I&s;&s;ue: And what Law can ari&s;e here?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Recorder.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Crook, <HI>The Keeper of the Pri&s;on was &s;poken to, to tell you, that we intended to try you this Day, and therefore ordered him, that Council might come to you, if you would; and al&s;o, that the Clerk &s;hould give you a Copy of the Indictment: This is fair; therefore we will go on to &s;wear the Jury; for the Matter is, Whether you refu&s;e the Oath, or not? And that is the &s;ingle Point, and there needs neither Law nor Council in the Ca&s;e; and therefore we con&s;idered of it la&s;t Night, when we &s;ent you Word, and did determine to try you; and there|fore it is in vain to &s;ay any Thing, for the Court is re&s;olved to try you now; there|fore &s;wear the Jury, Cryer.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you will not &s;urprize us: Then the other Pri&s;oners (who al&s;o were indicted) cryed out (having &s;poken &s;omething before) <HI>Let us have Ju&s;tice, and let not the Jury be &s;worn till we be fir&s;t heard.</HI> So there was a great Noi&s;e, the Court being in a Confu&s;ion, &s;ome crying, <HI>Take them away;</HI> others, <HI>Stay, let them alone;</HI> others &s;aying, <HI>Go on to &s;wear the Jury:</HI> Which the Cryer in this Uproar and Confu&s;ion did do &s;omething, as if he had done it: Then we all cryed out for Ju&s;tice and Liberty till the next Se&s;&s;ions; the Court being in a Confu&s;ion, &s;ome crying one Thing, and &s;ome another, which now cannot be called to Mind, by Rea&s;on of the great Di&s;traction that was in the Court; neither what we &s;aid to them, nor they to us, the Noi&s;e was &s;o great, and the Commands of the Court &s;o various to the Officers, &s;ome commanding them to take us away; others, to let us alone; others, to bring us nearer; others cried, Put them into the Bail-dock; others, to put them within the farthe&s;t Bar, where the Felons u&s;ed to &s;tand; where we were forced in|to accordingly: And in this Hurliburly and Confu&s;ion that was among them, &s;ome Men were &s;worn, to te&s;tify that we refu&s;ed to take the Oath, which we never po&s;itively did; other Officers of the Court, whom they would have &s;worn, refu&s;ed to &s;wear, tho' pre&s;s'd to it by the Chief Ju|&s;tice, they de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed. Then &s;pake one of the Pri&s;oners again pretty much, but could hardly be under&s;tood, by Rea&s;on of the Noi&s;e in the Court; but the People, to whom he &s;poke with a loud Voice, by Way of Exhortation, might hear the Sub&s;tance of what he &s;aid, which cannot now particularly be called to Mind; but it was to ex|pre&s;s the Pre&s;ence and Love of God to him&s;elf, and to exhort others to mind his Fear, that they al&s;o might be acquainted with God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

Thus the Inju&s;tice of the&s;e arbitrary Proceedings were expo&s;ed to publick View, when this Trial appeared in Print; that the King him&s;elf might &s;ee thereby, how ill his Subjects were treated. But at that Time there were &s;o many among the great Ones and Bi&s;hops, who were inclined to promote the Extirpation of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> that there &s;eemed no humane Help. <HI>J.

How long he continued Pri&s;oner, I can't tell.

<P>By the&s;e and the like Treatments we &s;ee how the Per&s;ecutors en|deavoured to root out the <HI>Quakers,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible; for the effecting of which, Alderman <HI>Richard Brown</HI> did whatever he could, continually letting loo&s;e the Reins to his exorbitant Malice, without regarding whether that which he was bent again&s;t was really puni&s;hable, or not, whereof the following In&s;tance may &s;erve for an Evidence. A certain Mender of old Shoes who belonged to the Society of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> was de&s;ired by a labouring Man on a &s;eventh Day of the Week late at Night, to mend a Pair of Shoes for him, that he might have them again in the Morning, becau&s;e he had no other to wear. The Cobler, to accomodate the Man, &s;at up at Work till after Midnight; but the Shoes not being fini&s;hed then, he went to Bed; and ri&s;ing early in the Morning, went to his Work again, as privately as he could in his Chamber. But an envious Neighbour informed again&s;t him for working on a Sunday; whereupon he was had before the &s;aid <HI>R. Brown,</HI> who committed him to <HI>Bridewel,</HI> to be there kept to hard Labour. And he refu&s;ing to beat Hemp, as being fully per&s;waded that he had not de&s;erved &s;uch a Puni&s;hment, was cruelly whipp'd, but he bore it with great Con&s;tancy, and not yeild|ing, he was turned up among tho&s;e of his Society, who were impri|&s;oned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">here on a religious Account.</P>
<P>As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his Ca&s;e, which befel an hone&s;t Man, was to be pitied, &s;o there happened about that Time &s;omething among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> which was facetious and ridiculous: For &s;everal of them being taken out of their religious Meetings, were confined in <HI>Newgate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Condition of Friends Confinement in <HI>Newgate.</HI></NOTE> where in the Night, they lodged in a large Room, having in the middle of it a great Pillar, to which they fa&s;tned their Hammocks, at the one End, and to the oppo&s;ite Wall on the other, quite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound the Room, in three Stories high, one over another; &s;o that they who lay in the upper and middle Rows, were fain to go to Bed fir&s;t, being obliged to climb up to the higher, by getting into the lower: And under the lower Rank of Hammocks, by the Wall-&s;ide, were laid Beds upon the Floor. Such a Multitude of Bedding for &s;o many Per&s;ons in one Room, could not but &s;omewhat infect the Air, and cau&s;e an unhealthy Steam; &s;o that &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ew &s;ick, and one of the Pri&s;oners died. This cau&s;ed &s;ome Bu&s;tle, and it was not without good Rea&s;on, that an ancient grave Citizen, having &s;een the Pri&s;oners thus crouded up, &s;aid, <HI>This is enough to breed an In|fection among them.</HI> And this having been told to Sir <HI>William Turner,</HI> one of the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> he came into <HI>Newgate,</HI> and bidding the Turnkey bring down the &s;aid Pri&s;oners to him in the Pre&s;s-yard, where he was, he ordered they &s;hould return to <HI>Bridewel,</HI> where they had been before.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;habby Fel|low thru&s;t in among them removed by Means of <HI>T.

This lazy Varlet was no &s;mall Burden to our Pri&s;oners; for whenever any Victuals were brought in to them, either

for their Money, or &s;ent to them by their Friends, he did not &s;tick to thru&s;t in with his Knife in Hand, and make him&s;elf his own Carver; and &s;uch was his Impudence, that if he &s;aw the Provi&s;ion was &s;hort, he would be &s;ure to take enough, tho' others wanted. But how burthen|&s;ome &s;oever this lazy Drone was to the Pri&s;oners, they could get no Relief; for to whom &s;hould they complain? Since the Keepers as well as others were for vexing and oppre&s;&s;ing them. But now at length an Opportunity was come to be rid of his trouble&s;ome Company. Among the Pri&s;oners, was <HI>Thomas Elwood,</HI> a Man of Literature, and of an acute Wit, with whom, long after, I entered into a familiar, and plea|&s;ing Corre&s;pondence by Letters. The &s;aid <HI>Elwood,</HI> when he had heard that they were to be &s;ent to <HI>Bridewel,</HI> drew near to the Sheriff, and point|ing to the afore&s;aid Fellow, &s;aid, <HI>That Man is not only none of our Compa|ny, but an idle di&s;&s;olute Fellow, who hath thru&s;t him&s;elf among our Friends, that he might live upon them; therefore I de&s;ire we may not be troubled with him at</HI> Bridewel. The Sheriff &s;miling, and &s;eeing this Fellow &s;tanding with his Hat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, and looking as demurely as he could, that the Sheriff might take him for a <HI>Quaker,</HI> called him forth, and &s;aid to him, <HI>How came you to be in Pri&s;on?</HI> I was taken at a Meeting, &s;aid he. <HI>But what Bu&s;i|ne&s;s had you there,</HI> &s;aid the Sheriff? <HI>I went to hear,</HI> returned the Fellow. <HI>Ay, you went upon a wor&s;e De&s;ign, it &s;eems,</HI> replied the Sheriff; <HI>but I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll di&s;|appoint you,</HI> continued he; <HI>for I will change your Company; and &s;end you to them that are like your &s;elf.</HI> Then calling for the Turnkey, he &s;aid, <HI>Take this Fellow, and put him among the Felons; and be &s;ure let him not trouble the</HI> Quakers <HI>any more.</HI> The Fellow not a little a&s;toni&s;hed at the hearing of this Doom, on a &s;udden parted with his Quaker&s;hip; for off went his Hat, and falling to bowing and &s;craping, he &s;aid to the Sheriff, <HI>Good your Wor&s;hip, have Pity upon me, and &s;et me at Liberty.</HI> No, No, &s;aid the Sheriff, <HI>I will not &s;o far di&s;appoint you: Since you had a Mind to be in Pri|&s;on, in Pri&s;on you &s;hall be for me.</HI> Then bidding the Turnkey once more to take him away, he had him up, and put him among the Felons.

For &s;everal Years he had been very much at <HI>London,</HI> and there preached the Go&s;pel with piercing and powerful Declarations.

<P>Not long after, coming to <HI>London,</HI> and preaching in the Meeting-hou&s;e called the <HI>Bull and Mouth,</HI> he was violently pull'd down by &s;ome Sol|diers and had before Alderman <HI>Richard Brown,</HI> and committed to <HI>New|gate.</HI> Several Weeks afterwards, being brought to the Se&s;&s;ions-hou&s;e in the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> he was fined by the Court twenty Marks, and to lie in Pri&s;on till Payment. But judging this unrea&s;onable in a high De|gree, he could not bend thereto for Con&s;cience-&s;ake. He was kept there in Pri&s;on about eight Months, with &s;ix or &s;even Score Pri&s;oners be&s;ides upon the &s;ame Account. But they being &s;o crouded, that for want of Room their Natures were &s;uffocated, many grew &s;ick and died, of which Number he was one.

But to this he &s;aid, It was not &s;o, but that he &s;till judged their Way of Wor&s;hip, e&s;pecially their Di&s;|putations and Will-wor&s;hip, to be out of the Way of the Lord: And in this Belief he died in Peace.</P>
<P>In his Youth he was of a chearful Temper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Something concerning his Convincement and Conver|&s;ion.</NOTE> and a Lover of &s;uch Com|pany: But being in that Condition often di&s;quieted in his Mind, he be|came a clo&s;er Follower of the Prie&s;ts and Teachers, and exerci&s;ed him|&s;elf diligently in reading the holy Scriptures, which, tho' good in it &s;elf, yet did not bring him to true Peace with God, tho' being or a quick Under&s;tanding, he could talk much out of them, in&s;omuch, that en|tering into Society with the <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> he became a Teacher among them. But tho' he was now more preci&s;e, and endeavoured to avoid the com|mitting of Sins, yet he found that Root, from whence they &s;prang, re|mained alive in him; for when he met with &s;omething that was con|trary to his own Will or Mind, Anger &s;oon prevailed: Neverthle&s;s in that State he would &s;peak of Ju&s;tification, Sanctification, and clean&s;ing by the Blood of Chri&s;t, tho' he him&s;elf was not come to that pure Wa&s;hing. In this State he perceived that he was no true Member of Chri&s;t, becau&s;e Regeneration was &s;till wanting. Thus he &s;aw that a high Profe&s;&s;ion would not avail, and that &s;omething more was requi|red to obtain a happy State: But as yet he knew not what it was that thus di&s;quieted him, tho' &s;ometimes on the committing of any Sin, he felt &s;omething that &s;truck him with Terror. At length it plea&s;ed the Lord, that he hearing one of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, preach, That which convinceth Man of Sin, was the Light of Chri&s;t, which en|lightens every Man coming into the World, this Doctrine entred &s;o deep with him, that he embraced it as whole&s;ome; and thus walking with great Circum&s;pection and Fear before the Lord, he found that by giving diligent Heed to that which inwardly reproved and condemn|ed him of Evil, he came to be delivered therefrom, and to witne&s;s Sanc|tification. And thus advancing in Godline&s;s, he him&s;elf became a zealous Preacher of that Doctrine, which had &s;truck him &s;o to the Heart. He was indeed a zealous Man, and tho' &s;ome were ready to think him too zealous, yet he was di&s;creet, and I know that he was conde&s;cending in indifferent Matters, thinking that there were Cu&s;toms, which tho' not followed in one Country, were yet tolerable in another.

the Ground, he broke his Leg, and the Bull then gored him again with his Horns, and roared, and licked up his Blood. One of the Maid-&s;ervants hearing her Ma&s;ter cry out, came running into the Field, and took the Bull by the Horns to pull him off; but he, without hurting her, gent|ly put her by with his Horns, and &s;till fell to goring of him, and lick|ing up his Blood. Then &s;he ran and got &s;ome Workmen that were not far off, to come and re&s;cue her Ma&s;ter; but they could not all beat off the Bull, till they had brought Ma&s;tiff Doggs to &s;et on him; and then the Bull fled.

from Colonel <HI>Kirby</HI> to pro&s;ecute him, notwith&s;tanding his fair Carriage, and &s;eeming Kindne&s;s to him before.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>G.

<P>This is that Act, by Direction whereof the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, were afterwards bani&s;hed, as may be related in due Time and Place; and tho' the King him&s;elf was pretty good-natur'd, yet he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be &s;o &s;wayed by the In&s;tigations of &s;ome envious Men, as well among the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks as among the Laity, that he gave the Royal A&s;&s;ent thereto.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t <HI>G. Fox</HI> was Pri&s;oner at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> many of his Friends were al|&s;o impri&s;oned, for frequenting Religious Meetings, refu&s;ing to take Oaths, and for not paying Tythes to the Prie&s;ts: But &s;ince he was not brought to his Trial till next Year, we will leave him &s;till in Jail, and in the mean while take a Turn to <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> where Per&s;ecution now was exceeding fierce.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>October,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruel and bloody Per&s;e|cution at <HI>Col|che&s;ter, W.

The&s;e beat &s;ome, and did much Mi&s;chief to the Forms, Seats, and Windows of the Meeting-place. And afterward the Mayor employed an old Man to &s;top People from going in at the Gate to the Meeting-Room; who told tho&s;e that would have entered, that the Mayor had &s;et him there to keep them out. Now tho' they knew he was no Officer, nor had any Warrant, yet they made no Re&s;i|&s;tance, but continuing in the Street, thus kept their Meeting in a peace|able Manner, being not free for Con&s;cience-&s;ake to leave off their pub|lick Wor&s;hip of God, tho' in that Time of the Year it was cold, and often wet Weather; and thus it continued many Weeks, tho' attended with &s;o much Difficulty.</P>
<P>In the Forepart or <HI>December,</HI> there came about forty or the King's Troopers, on Hor&s;eback, in their Armour, with Swords, Carbines and Pi&s;tols, crying, <HI>What a Devil do ye here?</HI> And falling violently upon this harmle&s;s Company, they beat them, &s;ome with Swords, and others with Carbines, without Di&s;tinction of Male or Female, old or young, until many were much brui&s;ed, cha&s;ing them to and fro in the Streets. The next Fir&s;t-day of the Week, the&s;e furious Fellows came again, having now got Clubs, wherewith, as well as with Swords and Carbines, they mo&s;t grievou&s;ly beat tho&s;e that were peaceably met together in the Street to wor&s;hip God. This cruel Beating was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that &s;ome got above an hundred Blows, and were beaten &s;o black and blue, that their Limbs lo&s;t their natural Strength: One there was whom a Trooper beat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o long, till the Blade of his Sword fell out of the Hilt, which he that was thus beaten &s;eeing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A remarka|ble In&s;tance.</NOTE> &s;aid to the other, <HI>I will give it thee up again,</HI> which he did, with the&s;e Words, <HI>I de&s;ire the Lord may not lay this Day's Work to thy Charge.</HI></P>
<P>But to avoid Prolixity, I &s;hall not mention all the particular Mi&s;u|&s;ages which I find to have been committed there. The&s;e cruel Doings continued yet &s;everal Weeks, and &s;ome were beaten &s;o violently, that their Blood was &s;hed in the Streets, and they &s;unk down, and fainted away.<NOTE PLACE="marg">E.

And tho' &s;he then did not re|ceive very fierce Blows, yet there were &s;ome Women who&s;e Lot it was to be &s;orely beaten with Clubs, whereinto Iron Spikes were driven, as among the re&s;t an aged Widow, who received no le&s;s than twelve &s;uch bloody Blows on &s;everal Parts of her Body; and another Woman was pierced in her Loins with &s;uch a &s;piked Club. An ancient Man of &s;ixty-five Years was followed a great Way by three on Foot, and one on Hor&s;eback, and &s;o beaten and brui&s;ed, that a Woman, pitying this old Man, &s;poke to the&s;e mi&s;chievous Fellows to leave off; but this &s;o incen&s;ed him that was on Hor&s;eback, that he gave her a hard Blow with his Sword on the Shoulder, with cur&s;ing and railing. This Barba|rity continued, till the Per&s;ecutors &s;eemed to be more wearied out than the Per&s;ecuted, who &s;eemed to grow valiant in the&s;e &s;ore Tribulations, how grievous &s;oever.

<P>His Name was <HI>Thomas Lurting,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Relation of <HI>T.

But returning, and pa&s;&s;ing by a Brea&s;t-work, they received a Volley of &s;mall Shot, by which two Men, clo&s;e to one of which <HI>Thomas</HI> &s;at, were killed, and a third was &s;hot in his Back, but <HI>Thomas</HI>

received no Harm. And going out of the Bay, they came within about four Ships Length of the Ca&s;tle, which had forty Guns; and when they came directly over again&s;t the Ca&s;tle, the Guns were fired, and a Shot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut the Bolt-rope a little above <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Head, without hurting him. In more Dangers he was eminently pre&s;erved, but that I may not be too prolix, I'll now relate, how from a fighting Sailor, he became a harm|le&s;s Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>About the Year 1654, it happened that among the Soldiers which were in the Ship he was in, there was one that had been at a Meeting of tho&s;e called <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and there were two young Men in the Ship who had &s;ome Conver&s;e with him; but he was &s;oon taken away from the Ship. Yet the&s;e two young Men &s;eemed to be under &s;ome Convincement; for about &s;ix Months after, they &s;crupled to go and hear the Prie&s;t, and to put off their Hats to the Captain; by which they came to be called <HI>Quakers.</HI> The&s;e two met often together in Silence, which being &s;een by others of the Ship, their Number increa&s;ed; but this troubled the Captain exceedingly, and the Prie&s;t grew not a little angry, and &s;aid to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Boat&s;wain, <HI>O</HI> Thomas, <HI>an hone&s;t Man and a good Chri&s;tian; here is a dangerous People on Board,</HI> viz. the Quakers, a bla&s;phe|mous People, denying the Ordinances and Word of God. This made <HI>Thomas</HI> &s;o furious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He beats the <HI>Quakers</HI> aboard.</NOTE> that in a bigotted Zeal he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell to beating and abu&s;ing the&s;e Men, when religiou&s;ly met together. But this was not the Way to have a quiet and &s;edate Mind; for the Remembrance of his former De|liverances &s;tuck &s;o clo&s;e upon him, that he could no more beat any of the &s;aid People; and then he came to a farther Sight, in&s;omuch that he clearly &s;aw what a Fellow the Prie&s;t was: For when <HI>Thomas</HI> could no longer abu&s;e the &s;aid People, then he was not accounted by him either <HI>an hone&s;t Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is under Trouble of Mind.</NOTE> or a good Chri&s;tian.</HI> Now being under Condemnation be|cau&s;e of his Outgoings, he made many Promi&s;es to the Lord; but the&s;e being made in his own Will, were of little Effect. Yet by the Grace of God it was &s;hewed him that &s;ince he did not perform the&s;e Pro|mi&s;es, he could not be benefitted thereby, which cau&s;ed to him much Trouble.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e in the Ship called <HI>Quakers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R. Dennis</HI> has much In|fluence upon him.</NOTE> was one <HI>Roger Dennis,</HI> whom be intirely loved, and therefore never &s;truck him; for this Man had a Check on <HI>Thomas,</HI> to that Degree, that looking only upon him, he dur&s;t not touch any of tho&s;e which he intended to have abu&s;ed. In this State, feeling no Peace in his Mind, after &s;ome Time, he much de|&s;ired to be alone, the more freely to pour out his Heart before the Lord; and tho' he then felt him&s;elf inwardly condemned, yet Judg|ments became plea&s;ant to him, becau&s;e thereby his Heart was tendered and broken; in which State he could not forbear &s;ometimes to cry out, <HI>0 Lord!</HI> But this being ob&s;erved by the Ship's Crew made &s;ome &s;ay, <HI>He was mad;</HI> and others, <HI>He was di&s;tracted;</HI> and of this &s;ome writ home to <HI>England.</HI> Now it fell to his Share to be mock'd and ridicul'd; but he endeavoured to be fully given up, if he might but have Peace in his Con&s;cience with God.</P>
<P>And being one Evening alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is moved, but very a|ver&s;e to join with the <HI>Quakers.</HI></NOTE> he was very earne&s;t with the Lord to know what People he &s;hould join him&s;elf to; and then it was plain|ly &s;hewed him, <HI>the Quakers.</HI> But this &s;o &s;tartled him at that Time, that he de&s;ired of the Lord, rather to die than to live: For to join with a People whom he &s;o often had been beating and abu&s;ing, &s;eemed to be harder to him than Death it &s;elf; and by the Subtilty of Satan he was often a&s;&s;aulted by various Thoughts, to keep him off from the &s;aid People. But when the Lord made him mindful of his manifold Pre&s;ervations and Deliverances, it mollified his Heart, &s;o that at Length he came to this Re&s;olution, <HI>Whether</HI> Quaker, <HI>or no</HI> Quaker, <HI>I am for

But the in|ward Reproofs of the Lord, attended with Judgments, followed him &s;o clo&s;e, that he could no longer forbear, but gave up. And then he took Opportunity to di&s;cover his Heart to his Friend <HI>Roger Denis,</HI> who &s;poke &s;o to the Purpo&s;e, that he had great Satisfaction. But not long after, Temptations a&s;&s;aulted him again in this Manner, <HI>What, to join thy &s;elf to &s;uch a fooli&s;h People?</HI> And the very Thoughts of this were &s;o grievous to him, that he grew even weary of his Life; for thus to expo&s;e him&s;elf to Scorn, &s;eem'd to him an intolerable Cro&s;s. But this Struggling was not the Way to get Peace with God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He goes to their Meet|ing.</NOTE> The fir&s;t Day of Week being come, he re&s;olved to go to the &s;mall Meeting, who were now &s;ix in Number; but it being reported that he was among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> many of the Company left their Wor&s;hip to &s;ee him; and they made a great Noi&s;e.

<P>He continuing to meet with his Friends for performing of Wor&s;hip,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are vex|ed by the Cap|tain.</NOTE> &s;ome more came to be joined to them, &s;o that in le&s;s than &s;ix Months after, they were twelve Men, and two Boys, one of which was the Prie&s;t's.

This Cabin he made u&s;e of al&s;o for a Meeting-place; and the Captain was now &s;o well pleas'd with him, that when &s;omething was to be done, he would often &s;ay, Thomas, <HI>Take thy Friends, and do &s;uch or &s;uch a Thing:</HI> For as yet they were not again&s;t fighting,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thomas</HI> and friends &s;uc|ce&s;sful in Ex|peditions.</NOTE> and therefore no compleat <HI>Quakers.</HI> And thus when <HI>Thomas</HI> and his Friends were &s;ent out on &s;ome Expedition, they did their Work beyond his Expectation.

<P>For being come to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> they were order'd to go to <HI>Barcelona,</HI> to take or burn a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Man of War.

<P>When Night came, they went out of the Reach of the Ca&s;tle-&s;hot; and he took Occa&s;ion to &s;peak with two of his Friends in the Ship, and enquired their Judgment concerning Fighting; but they gave little An&s;wer to it, but &s;aid however, <HI>If the Lord &s;ent them well home, they would never go to it again.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They re&s;olve again&s;t it.</NOTE> To which he returned, <HI>That if he &s;tood hone&s;t to that of God in his own Con&s;cience, and they came to it to-morrow, with the Lord's A&s;|&s;i&s;tance he would bear his Te&s;timony again&s;t it;</HI> for he clearly &s;aw, that for|a&s;much as they had been &s;uch great Actors in Fighting, they now mu&s;t bear their Te&s;timony again&s;t it, and wait what would be the I&s;&s;ue; &s;ay|ing with them&s;elves, <HI>The Will of the Lord be done.</HI> The next Day they heard that &s;everal were killed on Shore, which grieved <HI>Thomas</HI> not a lit|tle.

<P>Some Time after (about the Year 1655,) being at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> they were order'd to go a cruizing; and one Morning &s;pied a great Ship bearing down upon them, which they &s;uppos'd to be a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Man of War.

Being all met, he told them, how it was with him, and that Things &s;eemed very dark and cloudy, yet <HI>his Hopes were, that the Lord would deliver him, and all &s;uch as were, of his Faith;</HI> to which he added, <HI>I lay not this as an Injunction upon any one, but leave you all to the Lord:</HI> Moreover he &s;aid, <HI>I mu&s;t tell you, that the

Then he went upon the Half-deck again, and call'd for his Sword; which his Man having brought him, he drew with great Fury. No &s;ooner was this done, but the Word of the Lord, as <HI>Thomas</HI> took it, run thro' him, &s;aying, <HI>The Sword of the Lord is over him; and if he will have a Sacrifice, proffer i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him.</HI> And this Word was &s;o powerful in him, that he quivered and &s;hook, tho' he endeavoured to &s;top it, fear|ing they &s;hould think he was afraid, which he was not; for turning his Head over his Shoulder, he &s;aid to his Friend <HI>Roger, I mu&s;t go to the Captain.</HI> To which he returned, <HI>Be well &s;atisfied in what thou doe&s;t.</HI> And <HI>Thomas</HI> reply'd, <HI>There was a Nece&s;&s;ity upon him.</HI> Then &s;eeing the Captain coming on with his drawn Sword, he fix'd his Eye with great Seriou&s;|ne&s;s upon him, and &s;tepp'd towards him, keeping his Eye upon him, (in much Dread of the Lord) being carried above his furious Looks.

great Experience of the Lord's Deliverances, as hath been &s;aid above, he had already learned to tru&s;t in God, almo&s;t again&s;t Hope: On the Con&s;ideration of this, all Fear was removed from him; and go|ing to the Ship's Side to &s;ee the <HI>Turks</HI> come in, he received them as if they were his Friends; and they al&s;o behaved them&s;elves civilly: Then he &s;hewed them all the Parts of the Ve&s;&s;el, and what &s;he was la|den with.

This they promis'd him; and by &s;o doing he &s;oon perceived they gained upon the <HI>Turks;</HI> for they &s;eeing the Seamens Diligence, grew the more care|le&s;s and favourable to them: And having taken &s;ome &s;mall Matter of the Lading, &s;ome went again to their own Ship, and eight <HI>Turks</HI> &s;taid with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Then the Mate began to think of the Ma&s;ter, and the other Four that were in the <HI>Turks</HI> Ship; as for him&s;elf and the o|thers with him, he had no Fear at all; nay, he was &s;o far from it, that he &s;aid to one of his Men, <HI>Were but the Ma&s;ter on board, and the re&s;t of our Men, if there were twice as many</HI> Turks, <HI>I &s;hould not fear them.</HI> By this he encouraged the Seamen, who not being of his Per&s;ua&s;ion, thought much otherwi&s;e than he, and would have been ready enough to have kill'd the <HI>Turks,</HI> if they had &s;een Opportunity. In the mean while the Mate's earne&s;t De&s;ire to the Lord was, that he would put it into the Heart of the <HI>Turks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ma&s;ter with the four Men &s;ent back.</NOTE> to &s;end the Ma&s;ter and the four others back. And his De|&s;ire was an&s;wer'd; for &s;oon after the Ma&s;ter and tho&s;e Men were &s;ent on Board. Then all Manner of Fear concerning going to <HI>Algiers</HI> was taken away from him, which made &s;ome &s;ay to him, <HI>He was a &s;trange <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;ince he was afraid before he was taken, but now he was not.</HI> For before they were taken, he having heard there were many <HI>Turks</HI> at Sea, endea|voured to per&s;uade the Ma&s;ter to have gone to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> and there to &s;tay for a Convoy, and &s;o long they would have no Wages.

But his An&s;wer was, <HI>if we offered to ri&s;e, and they overcame us, we had as good be burnt alive.</HI> The Mate knew very well the Ma&s;ter was in the right, <HI>viz.</HI> that if they failed in the Attempt, they were like to meet with the mo&s;t cruel Treatment from the <HI>Turks</HI> that could be thought of. Now the Rea&s;on why the Ma&s;ter tho' a very bold &s;pirited Man, did not readily con&s;ent to the Propo|&s;al, was, becau&s;e he feared they would &s;hed Blood; but his Mate told him, <HI>They were re&s;olved, and he que&s;tioned not but to do it, without &s;hedding one Drop of Blood;</HI> and be&s;ides, <HI>he would rather have gone to</HI> Algiers, <HI>than to kill one</HI> Turk.

The &s;econd Night after, the Captain of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and one of his Com|pany, being gone to &s;leep in the Cabin with the Ma&s;ter, the Mate per|&s;uaded one to lie in his Cabin, and about an Hour after, another in ano|ther Cabin, and at la&s;t it raining very much, he pe&s;uaded them all to lie down and &s;leep:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mate di&s;|arms them while they are a&s;leep.</NOTE> And when they were all a&s;leep, he coming to them, fairly got their Arms into his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.

<P>But on the Ninth Day, being all upon Deck, when none of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were there but the Ma&s;ter, his Mate, and the Man at the Helm, they began to be &s;o untoward and haughty, that it ro&s;e in the Mate's Mind, <HI>What if they &s;hould lay hold on the Ma&s;ter, and ca&s;thim over board:</HI> For they were ten lu&s;ty Men, and he but a little Man.

But having heard that one of their Tenets was, that Sin might be overcome in this Life, this &s;eemed to him a great Error. And therefore when <HI>James Parnel</HI> came to <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> he armed him&s;elf with Arguments to oppo&s;e him earne&s;tly: For looking upon him as one that was but a Youth, he thought he &s;hould be able to prevail upon him.

of his Rea&s;on to defend the Truth he had embraced. But he &s;oon found that this was not &s;ufficient; for Self was not &s;ubdued under the Cro&s;s, and he was not yet come to an experimental Knowledge of what he a&s;|&s;erted and defended with Words. In this Condition he &s;aw that he mu&s;t truly become poor in Spirit, if God ever &s;hould enrich him with heavenly Wi&s;dom. This brought him to Mourning and Sorrow, by which he came more and more to be weaned from his natural Know|ledge, wherein he u&s;ed to delight. And continuing faithful in this Way of Self-denial, he at length began to enjoy Peace in his Mind, and &s;o advanced in Virtue and real Knowledge, that in Time he became an eminent Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, and travelling to and fro, many were converted by his Mini&s;try.</P>

<P>IN the foregoing Year we left <HI>G.

Being brought to the Bar before Judge <HI>Twi&s;den,</HI> he &s;aid <HI>Peace be among&s;t you all.</HI> At which the Judge looking upon him, &s;aid, <HI>What! Do you come into the Court with your Hat on?</HI> Where|upon the Jailor taking it off, <HI>G. Fox</HI> &s;aid, <HI>The Hat is not the Honour that comes from God.</HI> Then &s;aid the Judge, <HI>Will you take the Oath of Allegiance? G. Fox</HI> an&s;wered, <HI>I never took any Oath in my Life. Well,</HI> &s;aid the Judge, <HI>Will you &s;wear, or no? G. Fox</HI> reply<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, <HI>I am a Chri&s;tian, and Chri&s;t commands me not to &s;wear; and &s;o doth the Apo&s;tle</HI> James <HI>likewi&s;e; and whether I &s;hould obey God or Man, do thou judge. I ask you again,</HI> &s;aid the Judge, <HI>Whether you will &s;wear or no?</HI> To which he made An&s;wer, <HI>I am neither</HI> Turk, Jew, <HI>nor</HI> Heathen, <HI>but a</HI> Chri&s;tian, <HI>and &s;hould &s;hew forth Chri&s;tianity. Do&s;t thou not know</HI> (thus he went on) <HI>that Chri&s;tians in the Primitive Times un|der the ten Per&s;ecutions, and &s;ome al&s;o of the Martyrs in Queen</HI> Mary's <HI>Days refu&s;ed Swearing, becau&s;e Chri&s;t and the Apo&s;tle had forbidden it? Ye have Ex|perience enough, how many Men have &s;worn fir&s;t to the King, and then again&s;t him. But as for me, I have never taken an Oath in all my Life; and my Allegiance doth not lie in &s;wearing, but in Truth and Faithfulne&s;s: For I honour all Men, much more the King. But Chri&s;t, who is the great Prophet, who is the King of Kings, the Saviour of the World, and the great Judge of the whole World, he &s;aith, I mu&s;t not &s;wear. Now the Point is, whether I mu&s;t obey Chri&s;t, or thee. For it is in Tenderne&s;s of Con&s;cience, and in Obedience to the Command of Chri&s;t, that I do not &s;wear. And we have the Word of a King for tender Con&s;ciences. G. Fox</HI> having &s;poke thus much, ask'd the Judge, <HI>If he did own the King?</HI> To which he &s;aid, <HI>Yes, I do own the King. Why then,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>Do&s;t thou not ob&s;erve his Declaration from</HI> Breda, <HI>and his Pro|mi&s;es made &s;ince he came into</HI> England, That no Man &s;hould be called in Que&s;tion for Matters of Religion, &s;o long as they lived peaceably? <HI>Now if thou owne&s;t the King, why do&s;t thou call me into Que&s;tion, and put me upon taking an Oath, &s;eeing thou or none can charge me with unpeaceable Living?</HI> The Judge looking angry, &s;aid, <HI>Sirrah, will you &s;wear?</HI> To which <HI>G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>I am none of thy Sirrahs; I am a Chri&s;tian; and for thee, who art an Old Man and a Judge, to &s;it there, and give Nick-names to Pri&s;oners, doth not become either thy grey Hairs or thy Office.</HI> The Judge being a little more cool, after &s;ome Words to and fro, &s;aid, <HI>G. Fox, Say, whether thou wilt take the Oath, Yea, or Nay?</HI> To which he reply'd, <HI>If I could take any Oath at all, I &s;hould take this: For I do not deny &s;ome Oaths only, or on &s;ome Occa|&s;ions, but all Oaths, according to Chri&s;t's Doctrine, who &s;aid,</HI> Swear not at all. <HI>Now if thou, or any of you, or any of your Mini&s;ters or Prie&s;ts here, will prove that ever Chri&s;t or his Apo&s;tle, after they had forbidden all Swearing com|manded Chri&s;tians to &s;wear, then I will &s;wear.</HI> None of the Prie&s;ts offering

Two Days after, being brought again before the Judge, it was asked him, <HI>Whether he would traver&s;e or &s;ubmit&punc;</HI> To which <HI>G.

<P>Being Pri&s;oner in <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> Ca&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What hap|pen'd to him in <HI>Lanca&s;ter-Ca&s;tle.</HI></NOTE> there was much Talk of the <HI>Turks</HI> great Progre&s;s in <HI>Hungary,</HI> there being at that Time a War between the Emperor and the <HI>Turks;</HI> and many being afraid, he &s;aid to &s;ome, <Q>That walking once in his Chamber, he &s;aw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Power turn again&s;t the <HI>Turk,</HI> and that he was turning back <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></Q> And within a Month after, News came that he was defeated.

Or which I have for Proof what he mentions of it in his Journal, and al&s;o another &s;mall Book he gave out with the Title of <HI>A Warning to</HI> England. Not long after, a War broke out between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and &s;ome Time after the Pe&s;tilence appeared at <HI>London,</HI> (which lies Southerly from <HI>Lan|ca&s;ter)</HI> and after two Years, that City by the Fire was turned into Rubbi&s;h.</P>
<P>But I return to the <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> A&s;&s;izes. <HI>Margaret Fell,</HI> who was now a Widow, was al&s;o under Confinement for refu&s;ing the Oath of Allegi|ance. And <HI>G.

Then the Judge ask'd him, <HI>Whether he had not refu&s;ed the Oath at the la&s;t A&s;&s;izes?</HI> To which he an&s;wered, <HI>I never took Oath in my Life; and Chri&s;t the Saviour and Judge of the World, &s;aid,</HI> Swear not at all. The Judge &s;eeming not to take Notice of this An&s;wer, ask'd him, <HI>Whether or no he had not refu|&s;ed to take the Oath at the la&s;t A&s;&s;izes? G. Fox</HI> maintaining the Unlawful|ne&s;s of &s;wearing, the Judge &s;aid, <HI>He was not at that Time to di&s;pute whe|ther it was lawful to &s;wear, but to enquire whether he had refu&s;ed to take the Oath, or no. G. Fox</HI> then &s;ignifying that he did not di&s;approve the Things mentioned in the Oath, &s;aid, <HI>Plotting again&s;t the King, and owning the Pope's, or any other foreign Power, I utterly deny.</HI> Well, &s;aid the Judge, <HI>You &s;ay well in that: But did you deny to take the Oath; what &s;ay you? What would'&s;t thou have me to &s;ay?</HI> reply'd he, <HI>I have told thee before what I did &s;ay.</HI> After &s;ome more Words from both Sides, the Indictment was read. <HI>G.

F.</HI> was committed to Pri&s;on again, and Colonel <HI>Kirby</HI> order'd the Jailor <HI>to keep him clo&s;e, and to &s;uffer no Body to come to him, as one that was not fit to be di&s;cour&s;ed with.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is re-com|mitted, and Colonel <HI>Kir|by</HI>'s Cruelty to him.</NOTE> The Jailor did not &s;cruple to follow this Order, for he lock'd him up in a &s;moaky Tower, where the Smoke of the other Pri&s;oners came up &s;o thick, that &s;ometimes one could hardly &s;ee a burning Candle; &s;o that there &s;eemed to have been an Intent to choke him; for the Turnkey could harldly be per&s;uaded to unlock one of the upper Doors a little to let out the Smoke. Be&s;ides this Hard&s;hip, in wet Weather it rained in upon his Bed to that Degree, that his Shirt grew wet. In this pitiful Condition he lay during a long cold Winter, which &s;o afflicted him, that his Body &s;well'd, and his Limbs were much benumbed. Here we will leave him till he was brought again to his Trial, which was not before the next Year.</P>
<P>But before I part with him, I mu&s;t mention, that &s;ome Time before, he had written &s;everal Papers to the Emperor, the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and al&s;o to the Pope. The&s;e Writings were by &s;ome Body el&s;e turned into <HI>Latin,</HI> and &s;o given out in Print. In the&s;e he levell'd chiefly again&s;t Per&s;ecution for Religion's Sake. He reproved the King of <HI>Spain</HI> more e&s;pecially, becau&s;e of the Inqui&s;ition, and the burning of Peo|ple: And he did not &s;pare the Pope, as being the Spring of the&s;e E|vils, &s;aying, <HI>Innocent Blood hath long cry'd for Vengeance to the Lord: The Earth almo&s;t &s;wims with innocent Blood; and the Cry of it is heard. Your fro|zen, Profe&s;&s;ion, and your cold Winter-Images being &s;et up in your Streets, the Lord God of Power and Dread, and of Heaven and Earth will be avenged on thee, and you all; his Day is approaching. Ye great and rich Cardinals and Pope, ye have been fed like fat Hogs; and &s;eeing that thou would'&s;t not receive the Lord's Me&s;&s;engers, but threw them in Pri&s;on, and in your Inqui&s;ition, it may be the Lord may give you a Vi&s;it another Way, for his Dread is gone out, and his Zeal is kindled again&s;t you.&mdash; The Fields are &s;prinkled with Blood of the Innocent, and ye are the Aceldama, or the Field of Blood. But the Lord is coming to take Vengeance upon you; his Hand is &s;tretched over your Heads, and his Power is gone over you; with that he will rule you and &s;mite you down, and bring you that are lofty from your S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ats, and aba&s;e your Pride, and take the Glory to him&s;elf.&mdash; How much Blood, which is unmea&s;urable, and can't be mea&s;ured here, have ye drank &s;ince the Days of the Apo&s;tles, and made your &s;elves drunk with it! But now is the Indignation and Wrath of the Al|mighty come and coming upon you; and thou Pope mu&s;t feel it.&mdash; Tremble therefore, thou Pope, tremble, fear, and quake thou Pope, tremble ye Cardinals, tremble ye Je&s;uits, tremble ye Priors, tremble ye Monks and Friars, of what Rank &s;oever; for the Army of the Lord God is coming over you, by whom ye &s;hall be &s;haken and da&s;hed to Pieces.</HI> The&s;e are but &s;mall Sparkles of that Flame which <HI>G. Fox</HI> blew again&s;t the Pope, intermixing his Writings with many Demon&s;trations, that the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church was the Whore of

<HI>Babel,</HI> and that &s;he it was that had defiled her &s;elf with Idolatry and Super&s;tition, and had bathed her &s;elf in the Blood of the Saints, having furiou&s;ly attacked them with Sword and Fire. This he concluded with the&s;e Words: <HI>The Plagues of God will be thy Portion, O Pope, who hath de|ceived the Nations: And all ye Je&s;uits and Cardinals, howl, for your Mi&s;ery is coming, the mighty Day of the Lord God upon you all; the Lord God, who will be wor&s;hipped in Spirit and in Truth, and with none of your Inventions.</HI> Thus <HI>G. Fox</HI> wrote in that Day to the Pope and his Coun&s;ellors; and no Wonder that he paid dear for this &s;harp Language again&s;t the Head of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> for it may be believed, that a great many of the Court-party, in tho&s;e Days, were either conceal'd <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> or Fa|vourers of them: And yet among the national Clergy, and even tho&s;e of other Per&s;ua&s;ions, many branded the <HI>Quakers</HI> with the odious Name of <HI>&s;ecret Papi&s;ts,</HI> thereby to make them incur the Hatred of the People.</P>
<P>Now I return to <HI>Francis Howgil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">F.

Being come into Court before the Judges &s;at, he &s;poke to the Clerk of the A&s;&s;izes, and told him, <HI>He did not know whe|ther they expected his Appearance then or not:</HI> The Clerk &s;aid, <HI>You have done well,</HI> and that he would acquaint the Judge, and he &s;hould only engage to him to appear the next A&s;&s;izes, to an&s;wer the Indictment again&s;t him, and that he &s;hould not appear in Court; <HI>Francis</HI> bid do what he would. In the mean Time Sir <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave</HI> (&s;o called) a great Adver|&s;ary to the Truth, and the great and chief Pro&s;ecutor of <HI>Francis,</HI> had in|formed the Judges again&s;t him, <HI>as that he was a dangerous Per&s;on, a Ringleader and a Keeper up of Meetings of dangerous Con&s;equence, and de&s;tructive to the Peace of the Nation;</HI> &s;o then they concluded he &s;hould appear in Court; and &s;o the Clerk informed him, and told him about what Time he &s;hould be called: So the Court began; Judge <HI>Twi&s;den</HI> gave the Charge to the Grand Jury, in which he &s;aid, <HI>There was a Sort of People, who un|der Pretence of Con&s;cience and Religion, who &s;eemed to build upon the King's Declarations from</HI> Breda, <HI>and under Colour of this, hatched Trea&s;ons and Re|bellions,</HI> and gave the Jury Charge to enquire and pre&s;ent &s;uch, that the Peace of the Nation might be pre&s;erved; &s;o they empannelled the Jury, and <HI>Francis</HI> was called to the Bar, and the Judge &s;pake as follow|eth;</P>
<P>Judge, &s;peaking calmly to him, &s;aid, <HI>The Face of Things was much al|tered &s;ince the la&s;t A&s;&s;izes,</HI> and made a large Speech to him and the Coun|try, telling him, <HI>That all Sects under Pretence of Con&s;cience did violate the Laws, and hatched Rebellions, not</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>that I have any thing to charge you with; but &s;eeing the Oath of Allegiance was tender'd to you the la&s;t A&s;&s;izes, and you refu&s;ed to take it, it was looked upon that &s;uch Per&s;ons were Enemies to the King and Government;</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>I will not trouble you now to an&s;wer to your Indictment, but I mu&s;t do that the next A&s;&s;izes, in the mean Time you mu&s;t enter into Recognizance for your good Behaviour.</HI></P>

<P><HI>F.

<P>Judge <HI>Turner</HI> &s;aid, <HI>We do not de&s;ire your Impri&s;onment, if you will be of good Behaviour.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>F. H.</HI> pre&s;&s;ed further that they would not put him upon giving Bond to be of good Behaviour, knowing him&s;elf to be bound by the Truth, that he could not mis-behave him&s;elf.</P>
<P>One <HI>Daniel Flemming,</HI> another per&s;ecuting Ju&s;tice, had framed ano|ther Indictment again&s;t him for meeting, and &s;tood up (fearing the Snare of giving Bond would not hold) and &s;aid as followeth;</P>
<P>D. Flemming, <HI>My Lord, he is a great Speaker, it may be the</HI> Quakers <HI>cannot want him.</HI></P>
<P>Judge. <HI>Let him be what he will if he will enter into Bond.</HI></P>
<P><HI>F. H.</HI> Said, he had nothing to accu&s;e him&s;elf of, for his Con&s;cience bore him Witne&s;s that he loved Peace, and &s;ought it with all Men.</P>
<P>Judges both &s;pake, <HI>What do you tell of Con&s;cience? we meddle not with it, but you contemn the Laws, and keep up great Meetings, and go not to Church.</HI></P>
<P><HI>F.

<P>Judge Twi&s;den. <HI>Do you compare the&s;e Times with them? They were</HI> Hea|thens <HI>that per&s;ecuted, but we are</HI> Chri&s;tian <HI>Magi&s;trates.</HI></P>
<P><HI>F.

<P><HI>Philip Mu&s;grave</HI> &s;tood up, and &s;aid, <HI>My Lord, we have been remi&s;s to|wards this People, and have &s;triven with them, and put them in Pri&s;on again and again, and fined them, and as &s;oon as they are out, they meet again.</HI></P>
<P>Then &s;tood up <HI>John Louther,</HI> called a Ju&s;tice, and &s;aid, <HI>My Lord, they grow in&s;olent, notwith&s;tanding all Laws, and the Execution of them, yet they grow upon us, and their Meetings are dangerous.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Philip Mu&s;grave</HI> &s;tood up, and produced a Paper (and Ju&s;tice <HI>Flem|ming,</HI> &s;o called, &s;econded him) in great Capital Letters, and gave it the Judge; he told the Judge, <HI>That it hapned &s;ome</HI> Quakers <HI>were &s;ent to Pri|&s;on, and one of them died at</HI> Lanca&s;ter, <HI>and they carried his Corps thro' the Country, and &s;et that Paper upon his Coffin,</HI> This is the Body of &s;uch an one, who was per&s;ecuted by <HI>Daniel Flemming</HI> till Death.</P>
<P>Judge. <HI>We have &s;pent much Time with you, I will di&s;cour&s;e no more.</HI></P>

<P>Judge. <HI>You mu&s;t enter into Bond to come at no more Meetings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>F. H.</HI> I cannot do that, if I &s;hould, I were treacherous to God and my own Con&s;cience, and the People and you would but judge me a Hypocrite.</P>
<P>They were loth to commit him, yet at la&s;t they did.</P>
<P>This was in the latter Part of the Month call'd <HI>March,</HI> and he was kept about five Months as before, in a bad Room, and none &s;uffered to &s;peak with him, but who got &s;ecretly to him without the Jailor's Know|ledge.</P>
<P>It was about this Time, that <HI>John Audland</HI> departed this Life. He and his Bo&s;om Friend, <HI>John Camm</HI> (who&s;e Decea&s;e was &s;ome Years be|fore) had travelled much together in the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel; there|fore I will give an uninterrupted Relation of their latter End, but fir&s;t that of <HI>John Camm.</HI></P>
<P>He was of a very good Parentage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;hort Ac|count of the Life and Death of <HI>J. Camm.</HI></NOTE> born at <HI>Cam&s;gil,</HI> in the Barony of <HI>Kendal</HI> in <HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI> which Seat had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his Ance&s;tors long before him. From his Childhood he was inclined to be religious, and &s;eeking after the be&s;t Things, he joined with tho&s;e that were the mo&s;t &s;trict in performing religious Duties. And having afterwards heard <HI>G. Fox,</HI> he embraced as Truth the Doctrine he preached, and growing up in it, he him&s;elf became an eminent Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel among tho&s;e called <HI>Quakers.</HI> He and his Bo&s;om-Friend <HI>John Audland</HI> were the Fir&s;t of that Society who preached at <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> where having been in the Meetings of the <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Independents,</HI> they al&s;o had Meetings in &s;everal Places without the City; where there was a great Concour&s;e of People, and many received their Doctrine. Since that Time, the&s;e two Mini&s;ters travelled much together, and many were convinced by their Mini&s;try. But at length <HI>John Camm,</HI> who did not &s;pare him&s;elf, began to fall under a kind of Con&s;umption, in&s;omuch that thro' Weakne&s;s he was fain to &s;tay at home; and then he often called his Children and Family together, exhorting them to Godline&s;s, and praying to the Lord for them. Some Weeks before his Death, he once expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf thus; <HI>How great a Benefit do I enjoy above many, having &s;uch a large Time of Preparation for Death, being daily dying, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> for ever with my God, in that Kingdom that is un&s;peakably full <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.

ardent Zeal made him &s;train his Voice beyond what his Body was well able to bear. In a Meeting which he once had with <HI>J. Camm</HI> in a Field without <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> where <HI>Charles Mar&s;hal</HI> was one of his Auditors, after <HI>J. Camm</HI> had left off &s;peaking, he &s;tood up with an awful and &s;hining Countenance, and lifting up his Voice as a Trumpet, he &s;aid, <HI>I proclaim a &s;pritual War with the Inhabitants of the Earth, who are in the Fall and Se|paration from God, and I prophe&s;y to the Four Winds of Heaven.</HI> Thus he went on with mighty Power, exhorting to Repentance; and &s;poke with &s;uch a piercing Authority, that &s;ome of the Auditory fell on the Ground, and cried out under the Sen&s;e of their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. And when at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> he many Times preached in an Orchard to a great Mul|titude, he would lift his Voice up exceedingly, in order to be heard by all.

By this letter it appears, that there was an endeared mutual Love between this virtuous Couple. He was a Man of great Knowledge, but when his Under&s;tanding came to be opened by the preaching at <HI>G. Fox,</HI> he would &s;ay &s;ometimes, <HI>Ah, what have

We mu&s;t for&s;ake the World, and all its Glory; it is all but Vanity and Vexation of Spirit: It is a Saviour that I long for, it is him that my Soul pants after.

And tho' his Wife loved him dearly, and preferred his Company above what the World could give, yet in Regard of his Go&s;pel Service, &s;he gave him up freely to be much from home; where|by during a great Part of the Time of their Marriage, &s;he had not his de&s;irable Company. In the mean while he laboured diligently in the Lord's Harve&s;t, till his bodily Strength <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ailing, and meeting with hard Impri&s;onments, he was &s;eized with a mo&s;t violent Cough, which was followed by a Fever, &s;o that his Sleep was taken from him, which made him grow very weak; but he bore his Sickne&s;s with great Patience; and &s;aid once, <HI>That in tho&s;e great Meetings in the Orchard at</HI> Bri&s;tol <HI>he often forgot him&s;elf, not con&s;idering the Inability of his Body, from a De&s;ire to be heard by all: But that his Reward was with him, and be content to be with the Lord, which his Soul valued above all Things.</HI> Not long before his De|parture, being vi&s;ited by &s;ome of his Friends, he &s;poke to comfortably, and with &s;uch Power, as one that was beyond the feeling of his Weak|ne&s;s. To his Wife, who was big with Child, and nigh her Delivery, and well knowing how tenderly &s;he loved him, he &s;aid, <HI>My Will is in true Subjection &s;ubmitting to the Will of the Lord, whether Life or Death; and therefore give me up freely to his di&s;po&s;ing.</HI> And &s;he, how dear &s;oever he was to her, did &s;o; which gave him &s;ome Ea&s;e, &s;eeing her &s;incere Re&s;ignedne&s;s; and being &s;ometimes overcome with Joy, he prai&s;ed God in his Sickne&s;s; nay &s;o ardent was his Zeal, that once, tho' very weak, he de&s;ired to be helped up in Bed upon his Knees; and thus he fer|vently &s;upplicated
the Lord in the Behalf of his Churches, <HI>That they might be pre&s;erved in the Truth, out of the Evil of the World, and that his Go&s;pel might &s;pread, and be publi&s;hed to the gathering of all that pertain to</HI> I&s;rael. His Strength now dimini&s;hing daily, he &s;weetly departed at the Age of thirty four Years, about three Weeks after the Fever fir&s;t &s;ei|zed him.

About a Year ago being at my neighbouring Market-Town about my rea&s;onable and lawful Occa&s;ions, I was &s;ent for by an high Con&s;table out of the Market to the Ju&s;tices

<P>Judge. <HI>I am come to execute the Law, and the Law requires an Oath, and I cannot alter it; do you think the Law mu&s;t be changed for you, or only for a few; if this be &s;uffered, the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice is hindered, no Action can be tried, nor Evidence given for the King, nor no other particular Ca&s;es can be tried; and your Principles are altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with the Law and Government; I pray you &s;hew me which Way we &s;hall proceed, &s;hew me &s;ome Rea&s;on, and give me &s;ome Ground.</HI></P>

<P>Judge. <HI>Is this a good An&s;wer, think you? whether to be given with or with|out Oath? The Law requires an Oath.</HI></P>
<P><HI>F.

<P>A learned Man at <HI>London,</HI> of what Per&s;ua&s;ion I know not, put forth a little Book in Relation to this Act, wherein he &s;hewed from the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> the Ab&s;urdity of it, &s;ince all religious Acts exerci&s;ed by &s;ix Per&s;ons, not according to the Formality of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> were forbidden; and that at this Rate it might be reckon'd a Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, if a Woman being in Travel, and in Danger of Life, one of the Company &s;aid a Prayer; or if any one &s;poke &s;omething to com|fort the near Relations of a decea&s;ed Per&s;on; or prayed for the Health or Happine&s;s of a young married Couple, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which it might hap|pen, that &s;ome by the Malice of their Enemies, might not only incur Impri&s;onment for three Months, but al&s;o by Virtue of the Act of Ba|ni&s;hment, might be condemned to Tran&s;portation. That this was not without Danger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Orlando Bridgeman's</HI> Advice to a Jury on the Act.</NOTE> did appear &s;ufficiently by what Judge <HI>Orlando Bridge|man</HI> &s;aid at <HI>Hertford</HI> to the Jury, viz. <HI>You are not to expect a plain punctual Evidence again&s;t them for any Thing they &s;aid or did at their Meeting; for they may &s;peak to one another, tho' not with or by auricular Sound, but by a Ca&s;t of the Eye, or a Motion of the Head or Foot, or Ge&s;ture of the Body. So that if you find or believe in your Hearts that they were in the Meeting under Colour of Religion in their Way, tho' they &s;at &s;till only and lookt upon each other, it was an unlawful Meeting.</HI> At this Rate the Jury-men, who ought to be impartial Judges, or Mediators, were &s;wayed, &s;o that with|out Fear they might find the <HI>Quakers</HI> that were met together, guilty of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the Law.</P>

with &s;olid Arguments again&s;t the Charge of Sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">neckedne&s;s, an&s;wering &s;ome &s;pecious Objections; among the re&s;t, <Q>That the <HI>Quakers</HI> might keep &s;mall Meetings,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

Whitehead</HI> an|&s;wered, <HI>That it might have been objected to the Prophet</HI> Daniel, <HI>that he might have prayed &s;ecretly, and not with open Windows and thrice a Day, after king</HI> Darius <HI>had &s;igned the Decree,</HI> That who&s;oever &s;hould ask a Petition of any God or Man for thirty Days, &s;ave of the King, he &s;hould be ca&s;t into the Den of Lions;<HI>but that</HI> Daniel, <HI>notwith&s;tanding this Decree, had continued to pray to God as before. Since then,</HI> &s;aid G.

For neither the Threatnings of Men, nor their Severity or Cruelty acted again&s;t us, how far &s;oever it may be extended, can make us to for&s;ake the Lord in not keeping our A&s;&s;emblies, or to be a&s;hamed of Chri&s;t before Men, le&s;t hereafter he be a&s;hamed of us before His Father which is in Heaven.</HI> Be&s;ides he &s;hewed, <HI>How unrea|&s;onable it was to incite the Jury on an ill-grounded Su&s;picion, without leaving them the Liberty of their own Judgment:</HI> And the Judges he &s;hewed <HI>their Duty from the Law, and</HI> Magna Charta. He al&s;o &s;hewed <HI>how unequal it was, that Soldiers, who abu&s;ed his Friends in their Meetings, &s;hould be called as Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t them; and that they &s;hould be lock'd up with Thieves and Fe|lons, &s;ince this was contrary to the Right of a freeborn</HI> Engli&s;hman.

and he having thus obtained his Aim, read the Pri&s;oners Names, and &s;aid to them, <HI>What can ye &s;ay for your &s;elves, that Judgment of Tran&s;portation &s;hould not pa&s;s, or be given again&s;t you?</HI> To which they &s;aid, <HI>We are in|nocent, and have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed no ju&s;t Law; if we mu&s;t have that Sentence, we give up our Bodies freely into the Hands of the Lord; the Will of the Lord be done.

religious Duties (<HI>viz.</HI> Prayers, reading of, and meditating on the Holy Scriptures, vi&s;iting the Sick, and &s;uch like pious Exerci&s;es) as &s;he was before &s;he was married; which made her wi&s;h &s;ometimes &s;he had never entred into Matrimony, and that &s;he might live to enjoy again that Peace and Quiet which once &s;he had. But &s;he knew not yet that it was the Love of the Lord thus working upon her, to draw her off from tran&s;itory Things. In this State &s;he was often &s;eized with Grief and Sorrow, &s;o that &s;he counted her &s;elf the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of Women; for neither Husband, nor Children, nor any outward Enjoyments, could afford her any Plea&s;ure; but all her De&s;ire was to attain to an unde|fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed State, in which &s;he might live an unblameable Life, not only be|fore Men, but al&s;o before God: For feeling there was yet &s;omething in her which was evil and polluting, &s;he &s;truggled to overcome it; but all her Labour proved in vain. This made her cry earne&s;tly to the Lord as one in great Danger; and her Doubts, whether it was po&s;&s;ible to attain to Perfection, encrea&s;ed. But in this forlorn State it plea&s;ed the Lord to manife&s;t him&s;elf to her in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, tho' &s;he knew not then it was he. And often &s;he cry'd out, <HI>Lord, what will it avail me to know that thou ha&s;t &s;ent thy Son into the World, and that he was crucified and died for the Sins of the World, if I am not &s;aved by it. Lord, forgive my Sins, and have Mercy upon me.</HI> And once when &s;he was alone, pour|ing out her Heart before the Lord, he made him&s;elf known to her, and &s;poke to her Soul, <HI>That if &s;he would be perfect, &s;he mu&s;t follow the Light in every Re&s;pect.</HI> Having heard this, &s;he de&s;ired to know what this <HI>Light was;</HI> and the Lord &s;hewed her, <HI>That the Life was the Light of Men.</HI> This &s;he under&s;tood in &s;ome Degree, and &s;o &s;eparated her&s;elf as much as e|ver &s;he could conveniently from Conver&s;ation, endeavouring to live re|tiredly. And having about this Time heard Dr. <HI>Galenus Abraham&s;z,</HI> an eminent <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> Teacher, preach upon the Parable of the Seed&s;man, that which he &s;poke concerning the good Ground, and how the Ground mu&s;t be fitted by the Lord's Working, &s;o affected her, that &s;he re&s;ol|ved to re&s;t from all her own Labour; and &s;o &s;he left frequenting the <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> A&s;&s;emblies any more.</P>
<P>In this retired State &s;he continued a good while, and at length came to hear <HI>William Ames</HI> preach; and he declaring the Light of Chri&s;t as the true Teacher, this agreed with what had already been told her in|wardly by the immediate Manife&s;tations of the Lord to her. And thus &s;he came fully to be convinced that this was the Truth &s;he had &s;o long de&s;ired to know. Now &s;he &s;aw that it was her Duty to give up all, and to keep nothing back: For &s;he had already &s;een, that if &s;he would be Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciple, &s;he mu&s;t for&s;ake all, even her own &s;elf. But a Fear of the Cro&s;s was no &s;mall Impediment to her; yet now &s;he gave up to Obedience; and &s;aw that her former Performances had been defective; and now all came into Remembrance. This cau&s;ed Sorrow; but &s;he prayed to the Lord both Night and Day, and then he manife&s;ted his Power by which &s;he was led out of the Darkne&s;s and Bondage, where|in &s;he had been held Captive; and her Supplication was to the Lord, that it might not be with her as formerly, to wit, &s;ometimes great Zeal, and then Coldne&s;s again; but that &s;he might continue in Fervency of Spirit. After a long Time of Mourning the Lord manife&s;ted his Kindne&s;s to her, by which &s;he came to be quickned and refre&s;hed; and by the Judgments of the Lord all was narrowly &s;earched out; &s;o that nothing could be hid; and a Separation was made between the precious and the vile, and Death pa&s;&s;ed over all. But thus to part with all her own Wi&s;dom, and for&s;ake her great Attainments, was no &s;mall Cro&s;s; yet &s;he became willing to bear it, altho' many violent Tempe&s;ts ro&s;e to draw her off, if po&s;&s;ible, from clo&s;e adhering to the Beloved of her

Soul; yet &s;he was not forward in Imitation: For my Father, who when he was convinced of the Truth preached by <HI>W. Ames,</HI> and <HI>W. Ca|ton,</HI> &s;oon left off the common Way of Salutation, would &s;ometimes per&s;wade her by Arguments to do &s;o too: But &s;he told him, if the leaving off of that Cu&s;tom was a Thing the Lord required, &s;he believed he would &s;hew it her in his own Time, becau&s;e &s;he was given up to follow his Requirings. And &s;o the Lord did in due Time; and &s;he con|tinuing zealou&s;ly faithful, he was plea&s;ed after my Father's Death to give her a publick Te&s;timony, and &s;he became eminently gifted: For her natural Abilities &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the ordinary Qualifications of her Sex, and becoming &s;anctified by the Spirit of the Lord, could not but produce good Effects; and &s;he came to be much vi&s;ited and &s;ought to by Pro|fe&s;&s;ors; and the Fifth-Monarchy-Men applauded her, becau&s;e of her pathetical Admonitions. But &s;he was above Flattery, and trampled up|on it. Nay, &s;he was &s;o well e&s;teemed, that I remember, having &s;ome Movings to vi&s;it the Collegians in their Meeting, after one of them had left off &s;peaking, &s;he &s;tood up, and &s;aid, <Q>That &s;he had &s;omething upon her Mind to &s;peak to them by Way of Exhortation. But knowing that they &s;uffered not Women to &s;peak among&s;t them, &s;he was not willing bluntly to intrude her &s;elf; but de&s;ired their Leave;</Q> which they readily granted, and one of their chief Speakers &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o her, <HI>It is true, Friend, we don't allow Women to &s;peak in the Church; Yet we bear that Re&s;pect to you, that we give you the Liberty of &s;peaking.</HI> And then &s;he cleared her &s;elf, having formerly been a Frequenter of that A&s;&s;em|bly. And when &s;he had done &s;peaking, I don't remember &s;he was contradicted by any; but one of their Speakers concluded the Meeting with a Prayer.</P>
<P>Before that Time, &s;he writ and publi&s;hed a &s;mall Book to tho&s;e of her former Society, which &s;he called, <HI>A Serious Reproof of the Flemi&s;h Bapti&s;ts;</HI> in which &s;he dealt very plainly with them; and &s;hewed how they were apo&s;tatized. She writ al&s;o &s;ome other Treati&s;es, extant in Print; and was much beloved and well e&s;teemed by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Friends, as appears by &s;everal Letters written to her from <HI>England,</HI> and yet ex|tant. Tho&s;e of her own Nation often re&s;orted to her for In&s;truction, &s;he being &s;o well exerci&s;ed in the Way of the Lord, that &s;he was able to &s;peak a Word in Sea&s;on to various Conditions. Many Times &s;he vi&s;ited the Meetings at <HI>Alkmaar, Harlem,</HI> and <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and was often invited by her Friends to come and edify them with her Gift. She writ al&s;o many Letters for Edification and Admonition to particular Per&s;ons, and &s;ome Epi&s;tles al&s;o to the Church. But it plea&s;ed the Lord to take her early to him&s;elf. When &s;he fell &s;ick, &s;he &s;oon had a Sen&s;e that &s;he was not like to recover, and therefore &s;poke much to me in private, and acquainted me with &s;everal Things touching my &s;elf, and relating to her outward E&s;tate. And the Night before &s;he departed, &s;he called me to her Bed-&s;ide, and exhorted me very fervently to depart from Evil, and to fear the Lord; which by the Mercy of God in Time made very deep Impre&s;&s;ion on my Mind; &s;o that &s;till I find Rea&s;on to ble&s;s the Name of the Lord for having been plea&s;ed that I was the Son of &s;uch an excellent Mother, who early in the Morning when &s;he felt Death approaching, called me up out of my Bed, and &s;ent me to her Brother, and to <HI>W.

Dear Friends, keep in the Light by which ye are enlightned, and in the Knowledge of God, which every one hath received for him&s;elf; watching again&s;t the Seducings of Satan, that your Eyes may be kept open, le&s;t Deceit &s;hould prevail in any of you, by which Truth might lo&s;e its Splen|dor, and the Brightne&s;s of the Lord become darkned.</P>
<P>I write the&s;e Things to you in true Love; and tho' but young, yet as one that takes Care for you; for the Lord knows how often ye are in my Remembrance; de&s;iring for you, that ye may not only know the Truth, but that ye may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound to be living Witne&s;&s;es of it: For I knowing the Preciou&s;ne&s;s of it, cannot but de&s;ire that others may al&s;o participate of the &s;ame: Labour therefore for it my Friends, that &s;o, when the Lord comes and calls to an Account, every one may be found faithful according to what he hath received; For this is the Talent which the Lord hath given, <HI>viz.</HI> the Knowledge of him who is true, and who rewardeth every one according to his Deeds: But the neg|ligent and &s;lothful Servant &s;aid, that his Lord was an hard Man, and that he gathered where he had not &s;trawed, and this was his Condem|nation: For the Lord &s;aid, <HI>Thou knewe&s;t that I was an au&s;tere Man: Where|fore then gave&s;t not thou my Money into the Bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with &V;&s;ury?</HI> Mind the&s;e Things, my beloved Friends, ye that have an Ear to hear, and dig after this Parable in your &s;elves; for we all have received Talents, &s;ome more, and others le&s;s. Let therefore every one be faithful to the Lord, according to what he hath received; for truly &s;ome of you, I believe, have received five Ta|lents. Let it but be duly con&s;idered and &s;een in the Light of the Lord, what Knowledge ye have had of the eternal God beyond many, even when ye were yet in Darkne&s;s: How often hath the Lord appeared, and clearly made manife&s;t him&s;elf? And how abundantly hath he made it known in the Heart, that he it was who was worthy to be feared and &s;erved? Certainly this is a great and weighty Talent, and therefore the Lord may &s;ay ju&s;tly, What could I have done more to my Vineyard? O my Friends, be&s;ides all this, he hath cau&s;ed his eternal Light to &s;hine into our Hearts, whereby we have &s;een the corrupted Ways of the World, and the Paths leading to Death. This, I &s;ay, the Lord hath &s;hewed us by his eternal Light, Glory and Prai&s;es be given to our God for ever.</P>
<P>Dear Friends, go on in that which ye have begun; for I can bear Witne&s;s for the Lord, that his Love hath been abundantly &s;hed abroad upon us, without Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, becau&s;e tho&s;e that fear him, and work Righteou&s;ne&s;s, are acceptable to him: And he makes his Truth manife&s;t among us, and cau&s;eth his Peace and Mercy to re&s;t upon us. It is true, that Satan doth not re&s;t to &s;catter this, and to &s;ow Doubts and Unbelief in our Hearts; but we keeping clo&s;e to the Lord, are pre&s;erved from his Snares; and happy is he who hath found a Place where he is freed from Tempe&s;ts: But before this Place be found, there are many hidden Rocks that may be &s;truck on, not unknown to

<P>Dear Friends, keep your Meetings in the Fear of the Lord, and have a Care that your Minds are not drawn out to hear Words out|wardly, but &s;tand in the Cro&s;s to that which de&s;ireth Refre&s;hment from without: And when at any Time ye feel but little Refre&s;h|ment, let it not enter into your Hearts, that the Lord is not mindful of you, but center down into your &s;elves, in the pure Light, and &s;tand &s;till therein, then it may be, ye will find the Cau&s;e why the Pre&s;ence of the Lord is departed from you for &s;ome Time; and ye putting away the Cau&s;e, &s;hall enjoy the Lord again to your Comfort.</P>
<P>May God Almighty pre&s;erve you all by his Power, le&s;t any Strife or Di&s;cord be found among you; and may you grow up in Love, and thereby be obliged to bear each others Burdens; and let no tran&s;itory Things cumber your Hearts, but be re&s;igned to the Lord; for that to which we are called, is not to be compared to that which is tran&s;ito|ry, or peri&s;hing; &s;ince it is a Trea&s;ure that is everla&s;ting, and to which the World, and all that is in it, is but as Dung, becau&s;e the mo&s;t glorious Part of it is but Vanity of Vanities. O, my Friends, let none be &s;topt by that which is an Impediment to entring into the King|dom of Heaven; but &s;trive all to enter the narrow Gate; and &s;earch every one of you your own Hearts, with the Light ye are enlight|ned with, which &s;hall manife&s;t your own States to you; and keeping there, it &s;hall multiply your Peace, and every one &s;hall find therein his own Teacher, as tho&s;e have experienced who have &s;ought the Lord with all their Heart. Now the God of all Mercies, who alone is immortal, keep you and us altogether unto the End, that &s;o in the&s;e dangerous Times we may remain &s;tanding, to the Glory of his great Name. O Friends, keep our Craftine&s;s, and enter not readily into Di&s;cour&s;e with tho&s;e that are out of the Truth; for they &s;peak in their own Wills, and are crafty, and knowing no Bridle to their Mind, it produceth that by which the Simple and innocent are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ught: But &s;tand ye rather, and keep in that wherein ye &s;ee their Subtilty; for then, tho' ye may not have a Word to apologize for your &s;elves, yet ye &s;hall be above them.</P>
<P>This is written from me, a young Plant, in Love to you, accord|ing to the Gift received from the Lord. My Salutation is to you all in the Light of Truth.</P>

<P>With the other Pri&s;oners they had more Trouble and Pains, becau&s;e no Ship-ma&s;ters could be found that would carry them: Wherefore an Imbargo was laid on all Merchantmen, with Order that none &s;hould go down the River without having a Pa&s;s from the Admiral; and this they would give to no Ma&s;ter going to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> unle&s;s he made Pro|mi&s;e to carry &s;ome <HI>Quakers</HI> along with him to the Place to which they were bani&s;hed.

<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> yet the Fire of Per&s;ecution continued hot, and great Rejoicings were made wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the <HI>Dutch</HI> were beaten at Sea, and their Admiral <HI>Obdam</HI> was blown up with his Ship.

Thus the City became as a De&s;ert, and the Mi&s;ery was &s;o great, that it was believed &s;ome died for Want of Attendance.</P>
<P>It was about this Time that <HI>Samuel Fi&s;her,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S.

<P>Now travelling in the Country was &s;topt, which made &s;ome People go with Boats along the Coa&s;t, and &s;o went a-&s;hore where they had a Mind. Thus did <HI>Stephen Cri&s;p,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. Cri&s;p</HI> comes to <HI>York,</HI> and <HI>A. Parker,</HI> and <HI>G.

About this Time <HI>Alexander Parker</HI> and <HI>George Whitehead</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> where they had good Service in preaching the Truth. Great Fires were now kindled in the Streets to purify the contagious Air; but no Relief was found by it; for in the latter End of <HI>September,</HI> there died at <HI>London</HI> above eight Thou&s;and People in one Week, as I remember to have &s;een in one of the Bills of Mortality of that Time.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Ship in which the bani&s;h'd Pri&s;oners were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ship with the condemn'd <HI>Quakers</HI> could not go off, the Ma&s;ter being impri&s;on'd for Deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> could not go off, but continued to lie as a Gazing-&s;tock for tho&s;e Ships that pa&s;&s;ed by; for the Ma&s;ter was impri&s;on'd for Debt.</P>
<P>Now the Prediction of <HI>George Bi&s;hop</HI> was fulfilled, and the Plagues of the Lord fell &s;o heavily on the Per&s;ecutors, that the Eagerne&s;s to bani&s;h the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and &s;end them away, began to abate.

<P><PB N="433" REF="003104_0444_0FEFF7250BC492C0"><HI>Fir&s;t, I am a&s;&s;ured in my Heart and Soul, that this de&s;pi&s;ed People (called</HI> Quakers,) is of the Lord's begetting in his own Life and Nature. Indeed had I not &s;een the Power of God in them and received from the Lord an unque&s;tio|nable Te&s;timony concerning them, I had never looked towards them: For they were otherwi&s;e very de&s;pi&s;able in my Eyes. And this I cannot but te&s;tifie con|cerning them, that I have found the Life of God in me owning them, and that which God hath begotten in my Heart, refre&s;hed by the Power of Life in them: And none but the Lord knows the Beauty and Excellency of Glory, which he hath hid under this Appearance.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Lord hath hitherto pre&s;erved them again&s;t great Oppo&s;itions, and is &s;till able to pre&s;erve them. Every Power hitherto hath made nothing of over-running them; yet they have hitherto &s;tood, by the Care and tender Mercy of the Lord; and the &s;everal Powers which have per&s;ecuted them, have fallen one after another.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I have had Experience my &s;elf of the Lord's Goodne&s;s and Pre&s;er|vation of me, in my &s;uffering with them for the Te&s;timony of his Truth, who made my Bonds plea&s;ant to me, and my noi&s;om Pri&s;on (enough to have de&s;troy|ed my weakly and tenderly-educated Nature) a Place of Plea&s;ure and Delight, where I was comforted by my God Night and Day, and filled with Prayers for his People, as al&s;o with Love to, and Prayers for tho&s;e who had been the Means of outwardly afflicting me and others upon the Lord's Account.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly, I have no Doubt in my Heart that the Lord will deliver us. The Strength of Man, the Re&s;olution of Man is nothing in my Eye in Compare with the Lord. Whom the Lord loveth, he can &s;ave at his Plea&s;ure. Hath he be|gun to break our Bonds and deliver us, and &s;hall we now di&s;tru&s;t him? Are we in a wor&s;e Condition than</HI> I&s;rael <HI>was, when the Sea was before them, the Moun|tains on each Side, and the</HI> Aegyptians <HI>behind pur&s;uing them? He indeed that looketh with Man's Eye, can &s;ee no Ground of Hope, nor hardly a Po&s;&s;ibility of Deliverance; but (to the Eye of Faith) it is now nearer than when God began at fir&s;t to deliver.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, It is the Delight of the Lord, and his Glory to deliver his People, when to the Eye of Sen&s;e it &s;eemeth impo&s;&s;ible. Then doth the Lord delight to &s;tretch forth his Arm, when none el&s;e can help: And then doth it plea&s;e him to deal with the Enemies of his Truth and People, when they are lifted up above the Fear of him, and are ready to &s;ay in their Hearts concerning them, They are now in our Hands, who can deliver them?</P>
<P><HI>Well, were it not in Love to you, and in Pity, (in relation to what will cer|tainly befall you, if ye go on in this Cour&s;e) I could &s;ay in the Joy of my Heart, and in the Sen&s;e of the Good-will of my God to us, who &s;uffereth the&s;e Things to come to pa&s;s,</HI> Go on, try it out with the Spirit of the Lord, come forth with your Laws, and Pri&s;on, and &s;poiling of our Goods, and Ba|ni&s;hment, and Death <HI>(if the Lord plea&s;e)</HI> and &s;ee if ye can carry it: <HI>For we come not forth again&s;t you in our own Wills, or in any Enmity again&s;t your Per&s;ons or Government, or in any Stubborne&s;s or Refractorine&s;s of Spirit; but with the Lamb-like Nature which the Lord our God hath begotten in us, which is taught and enabled by him, both to do his Will, and to &s;uffer for his Name-&s;ake. And if we cannot thus overcome you (even in Patience of Spirit, and in Love to you) and if the Lord our God plea&s;e not to appear for us, we are content to be overcome by you. So the Will of the Lord be done, &s;aith my Soul.</HI></P>

The Jury then being called to be &s;worn, and three Officers of the Court having depo&s;ed, <HI>That the Oath had been tendred to him at the la&s;t A&s;&s;izes, according to the Indictment,</HI> the Judge &s;aid, <HI>It was not done in a Corner:</HI> And then asked him, <HI>What he had to &s;ay to it?</HI> And, <HI>Whether he had taken the Oath at the la&s;t A&s;&s;izes?

Before <HI>G. Fox</HI> was brought before the Judge, he had pa&s;&s;ed Sentence of <HI>Pre|munire</HI> again&s;t <HI>Margaret Fell,</HI> for having refu&s;ed to take the Oath.

<P>Whil&s;t he was there, tho' weak of Body, he writ &s;everal Papers. But the neighbouring Ju&s;tices laboured much to get him removed from thence to &s;ome remote Place; for it was pretty well known among the People, how the Court at the A&s;&s;izes had dealt with him. So about &s;ix Weeks after, they got an Order from the King and Council to re|move him from <HI>Lanca&s;ter;</HI> and they received al&s;o a Letter from the Earl of <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> wherein it was written, <HI>That if the&s;e Things which he was charged with were found true again&s;t him, he de&s;erved no clemency or Mercy.</HI> And yet the greate&s;t Matter they had again&s;t him was his Re|fu&s;al of the Oath.

He then told them, <HI>There was no Sentence pa&s;&s;ed upon him, neither was he premunired, that he knew of; and therefore he was not made the King's Pri&s;oner, but was the Sheriff's: For they and all the Country knew that he was not fully heard at the la&s;t A&s;&s;izes, nor &s;uffered to &s;hew the Errors that were in the Indictment, which were &s;ufficient to qua&s;h it.

After having &s;taid there a while, they pre&s;s'd Hor&s;es, and &s;ending for the Bailiff and the Con&s;tables, they had him to <HI>Giggle&s;wick</HI> that Night.

The next Night he was brought to <HI>York,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thence to <HI>York.</HI></NOTE> where the Mar&s;hal put him into a great Chamber, where many of the Troopers came to him. He then &s;peaking &s;omething by Way of Exhortation to the Soldiers, many of them were very loving to him. A while after, the Lord <HI>Frecheville,</HI> who commanded tho&s;e Hor&s;e, came to him, and was civil and loving, and <HI>G. F.</HI> gave him an Account of his Impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>After a Stay of two Days at <HI>York,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And thence to <HI>Scarborough</HI>-Ca&s;tle, where he is ill u&s;ed by the Gover|nour, Sir <HI>J.

Afterwards being come to <HI>Scarborough,</HI> they brought him to an Inn, and gave Notice of it to the Governour, who &s;ent &s;ix Soldiers to guard him that Night. The next Day they had him into the Ca&s;tle, and there put him into a Room,
<PB N="436" REF="003104_0447_0FEFF7294AB001F8">
with a Centinel to watch him. Out of this Room they &s;oon brought him into another, which was &s;o open, that the Rain came in, and it &s;moaked exceedingly; which was very offen&s;ive to him. One Day the Governor Sir <HI>John Cro&s;land,</HI> came into the Ca&s;tle with one Sir <HI>Francis Cob. G. F.</HI> de&s;ired the Governor to come into his Room, and &s;ee how it was; and &s;o they did: And <HI>G.

F.</HI> told him, <HI>That was his Purgatory which they had put him into.</HI> For it plainly appeared that there was an Intent to vex and di&s;tre&s;s him: For after he had been at the Charge of laying out about fifty Shillings, to keep out the Rain, and &s;omewhat to ea&s;e the Smoke, they put him into a wor&s;e Room, which had neither Chimney nor Fire-hearth; and lying much open toward the Sea-&s;ide, the Wind &s;o drove in the Rain, that the Water not only ran about the Room, but al&s;o came upon upon his Bed. And he having no Fire to dry his Clothes when they were wet, his Body was &s;o be|nummed with Cold, and his Fingers &s;welled to that Degree, that one grew as big as two. And &s;o malicious were his Per&s;ecutors, that they would hardly &s;uffer any of his Friends to come at him, nay not &s;o much as to bring him a little Food; &s;o that he was forced to hire &s;omebody to bring him Nece&s;&s;aries. Thus he &s;pent about a Quarter of a Year; and afterwards being put into a Room where a Fire could be made, be hir'd a Soldier to fetch him what he wanted. He then eat almo&s;t nothing but Bread, and of this &s;o little, that a Three-penny Loaf commonly &s;erved him three Weeks; and mo&s;t of his Drink was Water, that had Wormwood &s;teeped in it; and once when the Wea|ther was very &s;harp, and he had taken great Cold, he got &s;ome Ele|campane Beer.</P>
<P>Now tho' he de&s;ired his Friends and Acquaintance might be &s;uffered to come to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Friends de&s;iring it, not permitted to come to him, while many Papi&s;ts and o|thers have Li|berty, with whom he con|ver&s;es freely.</NOTE> yet this was refu&s;ed; but &s;ome others were admitted to come and gaze vpon him, e&s;pecially Papi&s;ts, of whom a great Com|pany once being come, they affirmed, <HI>That the Pope was infallible, and had been &s;o ever &s;ince St.</HI> Peter's <HI>Time.</HI> But <HI>G.

<P>Whil&s;t I leave him yet Pri&s;oner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of <HI>W.

He was a Man of a &s;trict Life, and ob&s;er|ved the eccle&s;ia&s;tical In&s;titutions there as diligently as any of the mo&s;t preci&s;e: But in Time he &s;aw, that bodily Exerci&s;e profited little, and that it was true Godline&s;s which the Lord required from Man. In this State becoming more circum&s;pect than he was accu&s;tomed to be, he did not frequent the publick A&s;&s;emblies &s;o much as formerly. But this was &s;oon taken Notice of; and being asked the Rea&s;on why, he &s;aid, <HI>That there was a Thing beyond that, which he looked for.</HI> But it was told him, <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> was a dangerous Principle.</HI> To which <HI>Dundas</HI> replied, <HI>That he was not to receive the Law from the Mouth of Man.</HI> Then the Mini&s;ter (&s;o called) &s;aid to him, <HI>That he tempted God.</HI> To which <HI>Dundas</HI> returned, <HI>That God could not be tempted to Evil.</HI> Now that which made him more aver&s;e to the Prie&s;ts of that Nation, was to &s;ee their domineering Pride, and how they forced &s;ome that were not one with them in their Prin|ciples, to comply with their In&s;titutions, &s;prinkling the Children of Parents even without their Con&s;ent. Add to this, their going from one Benefice to another, being always ready to go over from a &s;mall Church to a great one, under Pretence of more Service for the Church; whereas it plainly appeared that &s;elfi&s;h Intere&s;t generally was the main Cau&s;e. This Behaviour of the Clergy, and their rigid Per&s;ecution, if any deviated a little from the Church-Ceremonies, and the common Form,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The hard Ca&s;e of one <HI>Wood,</HI> a Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officer.</NOTE> turned <HI>Dundas</HI>'s Affection from them.

Wood</HI> continuing to maintain his A&s;&s;ertion, they began to threaten him with Excommunication, and would not allow him &s;o much Time as to give his An&s;wer to the next A&s;&s;embly. Excom|munication there was &s;uch a Penalty, that People under it were very much deprived of Conver&s;ation with Men. The Fear of this made <HI>Wood</HI> comply in a little Time; and meeting <HI>Dundas</HI> about three Months after, in the Street at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> he told him, <HI>That he had been forced to bow to the A&s;&s;embly again&s;t his Light; for if he had been excommunicated, he had lo&s;t his Livelyhood.</HI> Thus <HI>Wood</HI> bowed thro' humane Fear, but he hardly out-lived this two Years.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prie&s;ts jealous of <HI>Dundas,</HI> open his Letters at the Po&s;t-hou&s;e, and find he corre&s;ponds with <HI>G.

About a Week after, the &s;aid <HI>Quaker</HI> told a Relation of <HI>Dundas</HI> what Kindne&s;s he &s;hewed him, and how he had in &s;ome Manner been &s;aved by him; <HI>Yet,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I found the &s;ame Spirit in him that was in the other two Men who beat me.</HI> Such a Saying as this would have offended &s;ome Men, but with <HI>Dundas</HI> it had a contrary Effect; for the&s;e Words &s;o reached him, that &s;ome Time after meeting the &s;aid <HI>Quaker</HI> again, he de&s;ired, <HI>That as he pa&s;&s;ed that Way, he would make his Hou&s;e his lodging Place.</HI> Which kind Invitation he &s;eemed not unwilling to accept o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Dundas</HI> had now attained to &s;o much Experience, that he could di&s;cern between the Spirits of Meekne&s;s and Ra&s;hne&s;s, and &s;ufficiently perceive that the &s;aid <HI>Quaker</HI> by that which he &s;poke concerning him had not made him&s;elf guilty of the Latter: But yet he could not bow &s;o low, as to join in Society with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> tho' &s;ecretly he endeavoured more and more to live up to their Doctrine; and therein he enjoyed more Peace in his Heart than formerly.</P>
<P>But his outward Condition in the World not being very forward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goes into <HI>France,</HI> and &s;ettles at <HI>Diep.</HI></NOTE> he went into <HI>France,</HI> and &s;ettled at <HI>Diep.</HI> Whil&s;t he dwelt there, a certain Woman out of <HI>England</HI> came thither with her Maid, and &s;pread in the Town &s;ome Books of <HI>George Fox</HI> and <HI>William Dewsbury</HI> tran&s;lated into <HI>French;</HI> and &s;he her &s;elf having written &s;ome Papers, got them turn'd into <HI>French</HI> by <HI>Dundas,</HI> and &s;o di&s;tributed them.

Tho' I do not find what her Intent was in the Thing, yet it &s;eems likely to me, that &s;he not knowing the Language there &s;poken, would by a Sign te&s;tify again&s;t their Pride in Apparel and Dre&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Acti|on of an <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Woman at the Prote&s;tants Place of Wor|&s;hip there.</NOTE> and that on this wi&s;e: On the fir&s;t Day of the Week &s;he came to the Meeting-hou&s;e of the Prote&s;tants there, where &s;ome Thou&s;ands of People were met, and having &s;et her &s;elf in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous Place, ju&s;t over again&s;t him that preached, before the Service was fini&s;hed, &s;he &s;tood up with

the Maid that was with her, who taking off a Mantle and Hood &s;he was covered with, &s;he appeared clothed in Sack-cloth, and her Hair hanging down &s;prinkled with A&s;hes. Thus &s;he turned her &s;elf round &s;everal Times, that all the People might &s;ee her. This Sight &s;truck both Preacher and Auditory with no &s;mall Con&s;ternation; and the Preacher's Wife afterwards telling &s;omebody how this Sight had af|fected her, &s;aid, <HI>This is of deeper Reach than I can comprehend.</HI> The &s;aid Women having &s;tood thus a while, fell both down upon their Knees and pray'd, and then went out of the Meeting, many following them, and di&s;tributed &s;ome Books. Then they came to their Lodging, which was in a <HI>Scotchman</HI>'s Hou&s;e; but he refu&s;ing them Entrance, they came to <HI>Dundas</HI>'s Lodging, who knew nothing of all this. They therefore told him, that the Work they came for in that Nation was now done; and he asking what they had done, they told him; and &s;ignified that they wanted Lodging till they went away. Then he went abroad to &s;ee if he could find Lodging for them; but in vain; he then offered them his Bed, being willing to &s;hift for him&s;elf &s;ome where el&s;e, but they refu&s;ed to accept of his Offer; and his Landlady not being wil|ling to let them &s;it up that Night in any of her Rooms, they were fain to &s;tay that Night in an Out-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Now this Bu&s;ine&s;s had made &s;uch a Stir in Town, that one of the King's Officers coming the next Day to <HI>Dundas,</HI> told him, <HI>That he had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the Laws of the Nation, by receiving Per&s;ons of another Religion to his Lodging; for the King tolerated only two Religions,</HI> viz. Papi&s;ts <HI>and</HI> Pro|te&s;tants. To this <HI>Dundas</HI> &s;aid, <HI>That he had not tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the Law of Ho&s;|pitality, and he had been forced to do &s;o, &s;ince he could not let them lie in the Street, where they would have been in Danger of their Lives by the rude Multi|tude.</HI> Then the Women were taken away, and &s;ent to Pri&s;on; and they not being provided with Food, <HI>Dundas</HI> took Care of that. Some Time after, an Order being come from the Parliament at <HI>Roan,</HI> it was read to them, viz. <HI>That they &s;hould be tran&s;ported forthwith back to</HI> England, <HI>with the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;age-boat, and all their Papers and Books to be burnt in the Market, and them&s;elves al&s;o, if ever they &s;hould come to that Nation again.</HI> In Pur&s;uance of this, they were put into a Pa&s;&s;age-boat in the Night-time, and &s;o &s;ent to <HI>England.</HI> Afterwards the People at <HI>Diep</HI> intended to pur&s;ue <HI>Dun|das,</HI> as one of their Judgment; but he was unwilling to be looked upon as &s;uch, tho' the Prote&s;tants had inform'd again&s;t him, <HI>That he did not come to their Meeting:</HI> But of this no Crime could be made; and <HI>Dundas</HI> told them, <HI>If they per&s;ecuted him, being a Merchant, and trafficking there, they might expect the like to be done to their Merchants in</HI> England. And when the Judge affirmed, <HI>that</HI> Dundas <HI>was of the Judgment of tho&s;e Women,</HI> he told him, <HI>That they were better than he; but that their Way was too &s;trait for him to walk in.</HI> There fell out two Things which <HI>Dundas</HI> took &s;ingular Notice of; the one was, that the <HI>Scotchman</HI> who &s;hut out the Women, died within twelve Months after; and the other, that the Hou&s;e of his Landlady, who refu&s;ed them a Chamber to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it in, was burnt within the &s;aid Time, without its being known whence the Fire came, no Hou&s;es being burnt be&s;ides, tho' it was in the Middle of the Town.</P>
<P>In the mean while <HI>Dundas</HI> continued in an unquiet Condition; for by Rea&s;on of Human Fear, he found him&s;elf too weak to profe&s;s publick|ly before Men what he believed to be Truth.</P>
<P>Then he went to <HI>Roan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dundas</HI> comes to <HI>Roan,</HI> and thence &s;preads many Books written by Friends.</NOTE> but could get no Re&s;t there, being &s;ome|what indi&s;pos'd in Body, and having from <HI>England</HI> gotten a great many Books treating of the Doctrine of tho&s;e called <HI>Quakers,</HI> he &s;ent &s;ome of them to the Judge Criminal at <HI>Diep,</HI> and &s;ome to the Je&s;uits College there, and at <HI>Paris.</HI> Afterwards he &s;pread &s;ome Books al&s;o at <HI>Caen,</HI> where many Prote&s;tants lived.

By this he was forced to leave that Place, and went to <HI>Alencon,</HI> where &s;taying a while, the Judge Criminal &s;ent for him; and after a long Di&s;cour&s;e, he and <HI>Dundas</HI> agreed &s;o well, that he invited him to come and &s;ee him oftner, and that if he would, he might have an Oppor|tunity to di&s;cour&s;e with &s;ome of the Je&s;uits. But <HI>Dundas</HI> told him, <HI>That he was not willing to di&s;pute with any; yet he &s;hould not be afraid to maintain his Principles again&s;t all the Je&s;uits of the Nation.</HI> This being told the Je&s;uits, it &s;o exa&s;perated them again&s;t him, that being once out of Town, they cau&s;ed his Chamber-Door to be broken up, to &s;earch his Lodging. He complaining of this to the Judge Criminal, the Judge told him, <HI>He knew nothing of it, and if there was any Thing, it did proceed from the Je&s;uits, becau&s;e of his Confidence again&s;t them.</HI> This &s;eem'd not improbable, for he found his Letters opened at the Po&s;t-hou&s;e &s;everal Times, and when he challenged the Po&s;t-ma&s;ter, he re|ceived for an An&s;wer, That <HI>they came &s;o to him.</HI></P>
<P>Some Time after he returned to <HI>Caen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Returns to <HI>Caen</HI> and <HI>Diep,</HI> and &s;o goes to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> where he frequents Friends Meet|ings, and at la&s;t becomes one with them.</NOTE> where he was not long, but his Corre&s;pondent at <HI>Alencon</HI> &s;ent him Word, That the Day after he went from thence, the Governor of the Town had been at his Lodg|ing to &s;eek for him.</P>
<P>In the next Year, when a War aro&s;e between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> he came again to <HI>Diep,</HI> in Order to return to <HI>England,</HI> having got Pa&s;&s;age in Company of the Lord <HI>Hollis</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador from <HI>England,</HI> where being arrived, he frequented the Meetings of tho&s;e called <HI>Quakers,</HI> yet he was not bold enough to own the Name of <HI>Quaker,</HI> but continu'd in the common Way of Salutations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet at length the Truth they pro|fe&s;s'd had &s;uch Power over him, that not being able to enjoy Peace without yielding Obedience to the inward Convictions upon his Mind, he at length gave up, and &s;o entred into their Society, and obtain'd true Peace with the Lord, which he had long rea&s;on'd him&s;elf out of. In Proce&s;s of Time he publi&s;h'd a Book in Print, from which I have drawn this Relation, which he concluded with a Poem, in which he thank'd God for his &s;ingular Dealings and Mercies be&s;towed upon him, wi&s;hing that others might reap Benefit by it.</P>

&s;aid <HI>G.

And now ye have excommunicated us, that is, ye have put us out of your Church, be|fore ye have got us into it, and before ye have brought us to know your Prin|ciples.

And that he is the Head of that old Hou&s;e, or of his People? No,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Cradock, Chri&s;t is the Head of the People, and they are the Church. But,</HI> reply'd <HI>G.

And whether Chri&s;t had not ended Tythes, when he ended the</HI> Levitical-<HI>Prie&s;thood that took Tythes? And whether Chri&s;t, when he &s;ent forth his Di&s;ciples to preach, had not commanded them to</HI> preach freely, as he had given them freely? <HI>And whether all the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t were not bound to ob&s;erve this Command of Chri&s;t?

F.</HI> was often troubled while he was Pri&s;oner there; for mo&s;t that came to the Ca&s;tle would &s;peak with him, and many Di&s;putes he had with them. But as to his Friends, he was as a Man buried alive, for very few of them were &s;uffered to come to him. <HI>Jo&s;iah Cole</HI> once de&s;i|ring Admittance, the Governor told him, <HI>You are an under&s;tanding Man, but</HI> G.

F.</HI> But he told them, <HI>If that was it they de&s;ired, and it was permitted them, he was ready, for he never feared Death nor Sufferings in his Life; but was known to be an innocent peaceable Man, free from all Stirrings and Plottings, and one that &s;ought the Good of all Men.</HI> But the Governor now growing kinder, <HI>G. F.</HI> &s;poke to him when he was to go to the Parliament at <HI>London,</HI> and de&s;ired him to &s;peak with <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>Mar&s;h,</HI> Sir <HI>Francis Cob,</HI> and &s;ome others, and to tell them, how long he had lain in Pri&s;on, and for what.

<P>Now I may relate another remarkable Prediction.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Ibbit</HI> of <HI>Huntington&s;hire</HI> came to <HI>London</HI> a few Days before the burning of that City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its De&s;truc|tion foretold by <HI>T Briggs.</HI></NOTE> and (as hath been related by Eye-Witne&s;&s;es) did upon his coming thither, alight from his Hor&s;e, and unbutton his Cloaths in &s;o loo&s;e a Manner, as if they had been put on in ha&s;te ju&s;t out of Bed.</P>
<P>In this Manner he went about the City on the 6th (being the Day he came thither) and al&s;o on the 7th Day of the Week, pronouncing a Judgment by Fire which &s;hould lay Wa&s;te the City. On the Evening of the&s;e Days &s;ome of his Friends had Meetings with him, to enquire concerning his Me&s;&s;age and Call to pronounce that impending Judg|ment: In his Account whereof he was not more particular and clear, than that he &s;aid he for &s;ome Time had the Vi&s;ion thereof, but had delayed to come and declare it as commanded, until he felt (as he ex|pre&s;s'd it) the Fire in his own Bo&s;om: Which Me&s;&s;age or Vi&s;ion was ve|ry &s;uddenly proved to be &s;adly true, as the foregoing brief Account doth in Part declare. The Fire began on the 2d of <HI>September,</HI> 1666, on the fir&s;t Day of the Week, which did immediately follow tho&s;e two Days the &s;aid <HI>Thomas Ibbit</HI> had gone about the City declaring that Judgment.</P>
<P>Having gone up and down the City, as hath been &s;aid, when after|wards he &s;aw the Fire break out, and beheld the fulfilling of his Pre|diction,
<PB N="446" REF="003104_0457_0FEFF7B996F4FFB8">a &s;piritual Pride &s;eized on him, which, if others had not been wi&s;er than he, might have tended to his utter De&s;truction: For the Fire being come as far as the Ea&s;t-end of <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> he plac'd him&s;elf be|fore the Flame, and &s;pread his Arms forth, as if to &s;tay the Progre&s;s of it; and if one <HI>Thomas Matthews,</HI> with others had not pull'd him (who &s;eem'd now altogether di&s;tracted) from thence, it was like he might have peri&s;h'd by the Fire. Yet in Proce&s;s of Time, as I have been told, he came to &s;ome Recovery, and confe&s;s'd this Error; an evident Proof of human Weakne&s;s, and a notorious In&s;tance of our Frailty, when we a&s;&s;ume to our &s;elves the doing of any Thing, to which Heaven alone can enable us. I can't well pa&s;s by without taking Notice of it, that about three Weeks before the &s;aid Fire, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> landed in the I&s;land <HI>Schelling</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> under the Conduct of Captain <HI>Holmes,</HI> and &s;etting the Town on Fire, there were above three hundred Hou&s;es burnt down, belonging mo&s;tly to <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> that did not bear Arms. It may be farther ob&s;erved, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were beaten at Sea this Summer by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> under the Conduct of Admiral <HI>De Ruiter,</HI> in a Fight which la&s;ted four Days; &s;o that they had Occa&s;ion to call to Mind how often the Judg|ments of God had been foretold them, which now came over their Country, <HI>viz.</HI> Pe&s;tilence, War and Fire.</P>
<P><HI>G.

This was written by &s;ome of the Pri&s;oners called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and contained a Relation of the impetuous Carriage of the &s;aid <HI>Armorer,</HI> who be|ing a Knight and Ju&s;tice of Peace, had made it his Bu&s;ine&s;s many Years one after another, to per&s;ecute the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and from Time to Time to di&s;turb their Religious Meetings. From a Multitude of Ca&s;es I meet with in the &s;aid Book, I'II pick out but a few. The afore&s;aid <HI>Armorer</HI> came very often to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Thomas Curtis,</HI> at <HI>Reading,</HI> to di&s;turb the Meeting, taking many Per&s;ons Pri|&s;oners from thence, particularly once thirty four, both Men and Women, at a time. And when they were brought to their Trial, the Oath was tendered them as the mo&s;t ready Means to en&s;nare and to keep them in Pri&s;on.

But when it came to be known that he was the Son of Admiral <HI>Penn,</HI> he was &s;oon relea&s;ed. Yet this Change did not a little grieve his Father, who intended to have trained him up for the Court; but now &s;aw his elde&s;t Son in the early Part (being about the 22d Year) of his Age, enter'd into the Society of the de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>Quakers.</HI> Several Means were u&s;ed, nay even his Nece&s;&s;aries were with-held from him, to draw him off, if po&s;&s;ible, and bring him to other Re&s;olutions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Much conver|&s;ant with <HI>J.

<P>About the Forepart of this Year, (if I mi&s;take not) there happen'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ca&s;e at or nigh <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A very re|markable pa&s;|&s;age of a young Woman who murder'd her ba&s;tard Child, &amp; being after|wards convin|ced in Pri&s;on by <HI>J.

Is thy Servant a Dog, that he &s;hould do this great Thing? J. Crook</HI> thus opening Matters to her, did by his whol&s;ome Ad|monition &s;o work upon her Mind, that &s;he who never had convers'd with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and was altogether ignorant of their Doctrine, now came to apprehend that it was the Grace of God that brings Salvati|on, which &s;he &s;o often had with&s;tood; and that this Grace had not yet quite for&s;aken her, but now made her &s;en&s;ible of the Greatne&s;s of her Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. This Con&s;ideration wrought &s;o powerfully, that from a mo&s;t grievous Sinner now &s;he became a true Penitent, and with hearty Sorrow &s;he cry'd to the Lord, that it might plea&s;e him not to hide his Countenance. And continuing in this State of Humiliation, and &s;incere Repentance, and per&s;evering in Supplication, &s;he felt in Time &s;ome Ea&s;e; and giving heed to the Exhortations of <HI>J. Crook,</HI> &s;he attained at length to a &s;ure Hope of Forgivene&s;s by the precious Blood of the immaculate Lamb, who died for the Sins of the World. Of this &s;he gave manife&s;t Proofs at her Trial before judge <HI>Matthew Hale,</HI> who having heard how penitent &s;he was, would fain have &s;pared her, having on purpo&s;e cau|&s;ed to be in&s;erted in the Indictment, that &s;he had committed the Fact
<PB N="460" REF="003104_0471_0FEFF7C9FAA6CD10">
wilfully and de&s;ignedly. But &s;he being asked according to the Form, <HI>Guilty,</HI> or <HI>Not Guilty?</HI> readily an&s;wered, <HI>Guilty.</HI> This a&s;toni&s;hed the Judge, who purpo&s;ely had got the Words <HI>wilfully and de&s;ignedly</HI> in&s;erted in the Indictment, that from hence &s;he might find Occa&s;ion to deny the Charge, and &s;o to qua&s;h the Indictment; and therefore he told her, <HI>That &s;he &s;eemed not duly to con&s;ider what &s;he &s;aid; &s;ince it could not well be believed that &s;uch a one as &s;he, who it may be incon&s;iderately had roughly handled her Child, &s;hould have kill'd it wilfully and de&s;ignedly.</HI> Here the Judge opened a Back-door for her to avoid the Penalty of Death. But now the Fear of God had got &s;o much Room in her Heart, that no tampering would do; no Fig-leaves could &s;erve her for a Cover; for &s;he knew now that this would have been adding Sin to Sin, and to cover her|&s;elf with a Covering, but not of God's Spirit; and therefore &s;he plain|ly &s;ignified to the Court, <HI>That indeed &s;he had committed the mi&s;chievous Fact intendedly, thereby to hide her Shame; and that &s;he having &s;inned thus grievou&s;ly, and being affected now with true Repentance, &s;he could by no means excu&s;e her &s;elf, but was willing to undergo the Puni&s;hment the Law required; and therefore &s;he could not but acknowledge her &s;elf guilty, &s;ince otherwi&s;e how could &s;he expect Forgivene&s;s from the Lord?</HI> This undi&s;gui&s;ed and free Confe&s;&s;ion being &s;poken with a &s;erious Countenance, did &s;o affect the Judge, that Tears trickling down his Face, he &s;orrowfully &s;aid, <HI>Woman, &s;uch a Ca&s;e as this I never met with before; perhaps you, who are but young, and &s;peak &s;o piou&s;ly, as being &s;truck to the Heart with Repentance, might yet do much Good in the World; but now you force me, that</HI> ex officio <HI>I mu&s;t pronounce Sentence of Death again&s;t you, &s;ince you will admit of no Excu&s;e.</HI> Stand|ing to what &s;he had &s;aid, the Judge pronounced Sentence of Death. And when afterward &s;he came to the Place of Execution, &s;he made a patheti|cal Speech to the People, exhorting the Spectators, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that were young, <Q>To have the Fear of God before their Eyes, to give heed to his &s;ecret Reproofs for Evil, and &s;o not to grieve and re&s;i&s;t the good Spirit of the Lord; which &s;he her &s;elf not having timely mind|ed, it had made her run on in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; and thus going on from Wicked|ne&s;s to Wickedne&s;s, it had brought her to this di&s;mal Exit. But &s;ince &s;he firmly tru&s;ted to God's infinite Mercy, nay &s;urely believed her Sins, tho' of a bloody Dye, to be wa&s;hed off by the pure Blood of Chri&s;t, &s;he could contentedly depart this Life.</Q> Thus &s;he preached at the Gallows the Doctrine of the <HI>Quakers</HI> &s;o called, and gave Heart-melting Proofs, that her immortal Soul was to enter into Paradice, as well as anciently that of the Thief on the Cro&s;s. I have been credibly informed by a Per&s;on who had it from the Mouths of &s;uch as were pre&s;ent at the Execution, that in her Reque&s;t to God &s;he prayed, that it might plea&s;e him to give a vi&s;ible Sign, that &s;he was received into his Favour. And that tho' it was then a cloudy Day, yet immediately after &s;he was turned off, the Clouds broke a little, and the Sun for a few Moments &s;hined upon her Face, and pre&s;ently after cea&s;ed &s;hining, and the Sky continued overca&s;t. She thus in a &s;erious Frame of Mind &s;uffered Death, which her Crime ju&s;tly de&s;erved.</P>

<P><HI>There are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Gho&s;t; and the&s;e three are one.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The&s;e are either three Manife&s;tations, three Operations, three Sub&s;tances, or three Somethings el&s;e be&s;ides Sub&s;i&s;tences.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But they are not three Manife&s;tations, three Operations, three Sub&s;tances, nor three any things el&s;e be&s;ides Sub&s;i&s;tences.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ergo, Three Sub&s;i&s;tences.</HI></P>
<P><HI>G. Whitehead</HI> rejected the&s;e Terms, <HI>as not to be found in Scripture, nor deduceable from</HI> I John v. 7. the Place <HI>Vincent</HI> in&s;tanced. And there|fore he de&s;ired an Explanation of tho&s;e Terms, <HI>in&s;omuch as God did not u&s;e to wrap up his Truths in heatheni&s;h Metaphy&s;icks, but in plain Language.</HI> But whatever was &s;aid, no better Explanation could be obtained than <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> or <HI>the Mode of a Sub&s;tance. G.

Then <HI>W.

or Beings; con&s;equently three Gods: For if the infinite Godhead &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in three &s;eparate Manners or Forms, then is not any one of them a perfect and compleat Sub&s;i&s;tence without the other two: So Parts, and &s;omething finite it in God; or if infinite, then three di&s;tinct infinite Sub&s;i&s;tences; and what is this, but to a&s;&s;ert three Gods, &s;ince none is infinite but God? On the contrary, there being an In&s;eparability betwixt the Sub&s;tance and its Sub&s;i&s;tence, the &V;nity of Sub&s;tance will not admit a Trinity of incommunicable or di&s;tinct Sub&s;i&s;tences.</HI> After &s;eve|ral Words on both Sides, <HI>G. Whitehead,</HI> to bring this &s;trange Doctrine nearer to the Capacity of the People, comparing their three Per&s;ons to three Apo&s;tles, &s;aid, <HI>He did not under&s;tand, how</HI> Paul, Peter, <HI>and</HI> John <HI>could be three Per&s;ons and one Apo&s;tle.</HI> At which one <HI>Maddocks,</HI> one of <HI>Vincent</HI>'s A&s;&s;i&s;tants, framed this odd Syllogi&s;m, <HI>He that &s;cornfully and reproachfully compares our Doctrine of the ble&s;&s;ed Trinity of Father, Son, and Spirit, one in E&s;&s;ence, but three in Per&s;ons, to three finite Men, as</HI> Paul, Peter, <HI>and</HI> John, <HI>is a Bla&s;phemer. But you</HI> G. Whitehead <HI>have done &s;o.</HI> Ergo. A ra&s;h Conclu&s;ion; but how firm, let the judicious Reader determine. I have no Mind to enter farther into this Quarrel, &s;ince the Parties on both Sides went away un&s;atisfied: For <HI>Vincent</HI> had not been able to prove <HI>the Doctrines of the</HI> Quakers <HI>damnable,</HI> as he had a&s;&s;erted. But his Pa&s;&s;ion had tran&s;ported him, as well as when he &s;aid from the Pulpit to tho&s;e of his Society, <HI>That he had as lief they &s;hould go to a Bawdy-hou&s;e, as to frequent the</HI> Quakers <HI>Meetings, becau&s;e of their erroneous and damnable Doctrines.</HI> And pointing to the Window, he farther &s;aid, <HI>If there &s;hould &s;tand a Cup of Poy&s;on, I would rather drink it, than &s;uck in their damnable Doctrines.</HI> But this untimely Zeal did not profit him; for it gave Occa&s;ion to &s;ome of his Hearers to enquire into the Doctrines of the <HI>Quakers;</HI> and thus &s;ome came to be convinced of the Truth thereof.</P>

But tho' he was as a Son of Thunder, yet his agreeable Speech flow'd from his Mouth like a plea&s;ant Stream, to the Con&s;olation and Comfort of pious Souls. Oh! how pathetically have I heard him pray, when he, as tran&s;ported and ravi&s;hed, humbly be&s;eeched God, that it might plea&s;e him to reach to the hard-hearted, to &s;upport the Godly, and to pre&s;erve them &s;teadfa&s;t: Nay, with what a charming and melodious Voice did he &s;ound forth the Prai&s;eS of the Mo&s;t High in his publick Prayers!

I beheld his Countenance much unlike what it u&s;ed to be, for it clearly manife&s;ted his bodily Indi&s;po&s;ition: Neverthele&s;s he preached with a godly Zeal, and his &s;alutary Exhortations flowed like a Stream from his Lips, which &s;eem'd to be touch'd with a Coal from the Altar of Heaven, whil&s;t he was preaching the Go&s;pel, to the Edification of his Heare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.

But be &s;ure that thou let nothing &s;eparate thy Love from God and his Peo|ple; tho&s;e are his People that keep his Law, and obey Chri&s;t's Voice, and lead a holy Life, and they were ever hated, and belied, and per&s;ecuted, and evi1-&s;po|ken on always by had and evil loo&s;e People; the&s;e are God's People, and his Love, and Peace, and Ble&s;&s;ing is with them; do thou grow as a natural Branch (up among them) of the living Vine, and continue all thy Days in Obedience unto God's Will, and thou wilt feel Joy and Love in thy Heart, which above all things covet after, and thou &s;halt attain and obtain everla&s;ting Peace, which the Lord grant unto thee, according to the Riches of his Mercy and Love, which en|dure for ever and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>In the mean while Per&s;ecution in many Places grew very di&s;mal; for many of the Friends were beaten with Swords, and Pikes, and Muskets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Cruel|ty.</NOTE> to that Degree, that their Blood ran along the Ground, and the Inform|ers were &s;o very eager to hunt after their Prey, that they informed of Meetings when there was none.

<P>For <HI>Brown</HI> him&s;elf formerly had been an <HI>Independent,</HI> tho' now he be|longed to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and was of the Court Party.

Why may I not have the Privilege of an</HI> Engli&s;h Man, <HI>and you might be a&s;hamed of this Dealing.</HI> At this the envious Recorder &s;aid, <HI>I look upon you to be an Enemy to the Laws of</HI> England, <HI>which ought to be ob&s;er|ved and kept; nor are you worthy of &s;uch Privileges as others have. Mead</HI> well &s;eeing that Force and Violence prevailed, and that his &s;peaking could not avail him, &s;aid, with a compo&s;ed Mind, <HI>The Lord be Judge between me and thee in this Matter.</HI></P>
<P>Upon which he was taken away into the Bale-dock, and the Recorder gave the Jury the following Charge; <Q>You have heard what the Indict|ment is; it is for preaching to the People, and drawing a tumultuous Company after them; and Mr. <HI>Penn</HI> was &s;peaking. If they &s;hould not be di&s;turbed, you &s;ee they will go on; there are Three or Four Wit|ne&s;&s;es, that have proved this that he did preach there; that Mr. <HI>Mead</HI> did allow of it; after this, you have heard by &s;ub&s;tantial Witne&s;&s;es what is &s;aid again&s;t them. Now we are upon the Matter of Fact, which you are to keep to, and ob&s;erve, as what hath been fully &s;worn, at your Peril.</Q> That the Recorder &s;poke thus to the Jury in the Ab&s;ence of the Pri&s;oners, was indeed irregular; wherefore <HI>W. Penn,</HI> who heard this from a far, &s;poke with a very rai&s;ed Voice, that &s;o, he might be heard by tho&s;e on the Bench, after this Manner, <Q>I appeal to the Jury, who are my Judges, and to this great A&s;&s;embly, whe|ther the Proceedings of the Court are not mo&s;t arbitrary, and void of all Law, in offering to give the Jury their Charge in the Ab&s;ence of the Pri&s;oners. I &s;ay it is directly oppo&s;ite to, and de&s;tructive of the undoubted Right of every <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oner, as <HI>Cook in the</HI> 2 In&s;t. <HI>on the Chapter of</HI> Magna Charta <HI>&s;peaks.</HI></Q> The Recorder being thus unex|pectedly la&s;ht for his extra-judicial Procedure, &s;aid with a di&s;dainful

Smile, <HI>Why, ye are pre&s;ent; you do hear, do you not?</HI> To which <HI>Penn</HI> re|turned, <HI>No Thanks to the Court, that commanded me into the Bale-dock: And you of the Jury take Notice, that I have not been heard, neither can you legally depart the Court, before I have been fully heard, having at lea&s;t ten or twelve material Points to offer, in Order to invalidate their Indictment.</HI> This plain Speaking of <HI>W. Penn</HI> &s;o enraged the Recorder, that he cryed, <HI>Pull that Fellow down, pull him down:</HI> For <HI>Penn,</HI> it &s;eems, to be heard the better, was clamber'd up a little by the Rails of the Bale-dock. Then <HI>W.

<P>The Pri&s;oners then being kept in a &s;tinking Hole, the Jury were commanded up, to agree upon their Verdict: And after an Hour and half's Time eight came down agreed, but four remained above: The Court then &s;ent an Officer for them, and they accordingly came down.

the Mea&s;ure of my Jury's Verdict.</HI> This mode&s;t Speech &s;o incen&s;ed the Recorder, that he cryed, <HI>Stop that prating Fellow's Mouth, or put him out of the Court.</HI> And the Lord Mayor &s;aid to the Jury, <HI>You have heard that he preached, that he gathered a Company of tumultuous People, and that they do not only di&s;obey the martial Power, but the civil al&s;o.</HI> To which <HI>W.

<P>The Court now being re&s;olved to &s;end the Pri&s;oners to their Jail, and the Jury to their Chamber, <HI>Penn</HI> &s;poke as followeth, <HI>The Agreement of twelve Men is a Verdict in Law, and &s;uch an one being given by the Jury, I re|quire the Clerk of the Peace to record it, as he will an&s;wer it at his Peril.

Thus Force and Violence prevail'd. The next Day, tho' it was the fir&s;t of the Week, vulgarly called <HI>Sunday,</HI> the Court &s;at again; and the Pri&s;oners being brought to the Bar, the Jury were called in, and their Foreman was ask'd, <HI>Is</HI> William Penn <HI>guilty of the Matter whereof he &s;tands indicted, in Manner and Form afore&s;aid, or not guilty?</HI> To which he an&s;wered as before, William Penn <HI>is guilty of &s;peak|ing in Grace-church-&s;treet.</HI> The Lord Mayor then asking, <HI>To an unlawful A&s;&s;embly?

For an Indictment was formed again&s;t him for having hindred due Cour&s;e of Law again&s;t one <HI>Samuel Allingbridge.</HI> But <HI>Rudyard</HI> &s;o well defended him&s;elf, that he was acquitted; which &s;o incen&s;ed the Lord Mayor, that not long after he was again committed to <HI>Newgate,</HI> on a religious Account,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And again, in another Pro&s;ecution.

<P>But to avoid Prolixity, I &s;hall relate but little of them, &s;ince many Things occur therein, which have been mentioned already in other Ca|&s;es. How the Recorder <HI>Howel</HI> was inclined in re&s;pect to Religion, may be deduced from what hath been &s;aid already of his Panegyrick upon the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Inqui&s;ition. And to <HI>Rudyard</HI> and his Fellow-Pri&s;oners he gave no ob&s;cure Evidence what Religion he preferred;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Touch at the Religion of <HI>Howel</HI> the Recorder.</NOTE> for they &s;aying, <HI>That they were always quiet and peaceable in their A&s;&s;emblies, and that the Laws again&s;t Riots were never intended again&s;t them, but Popi&s;h, or &s;uch like Di&s;tur|bers of the Peace.</HI> The Recorder returned, <HI>That the</HI> Papi&s;ts <HI>were better Subjects to the King, than they were; and that they were a &s;tubborn and dange|rous People, and mu&s;t either be brought under, or there was no &s;afe living by them.</HI> The Pri&s;oners offering to vindicate them&s;elves from the&s;e odious and &s;oul A&s;per&s;ions, were not &s;uffered to &s;ay any Thing in their own Defence; but in&s;tead of hearing them, they were by Order of the Lord Mayor and the Recorder thru&s;t into the Bale-dock, and treated almo&s;t at the &s;ame Rate as <HI>W. Penn</HI> and <HI>W. Mead</HI> had been before.</P>
<P>But Violence prevailed now; and the Recorder, becau&s;e of his out|ragious Behaviour again&s;t the <HI>Quakers,</HI> was &s;o much in Favour of the Court of Ju&s;tice, that Alderman <HI>Jo. Robin&s;on</HI> did not &s;tick to tell them, <HI>That the Recorder de&s;erved an hundred Pounds for his Service done at the</HI> Old Baily <HI>the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">To whom 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> is order'd to be paid for his good Service, by the Cham|berlain of <HI>London,</HI> as had 200<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> be|fore.</NOTE> And his Propo&s;al &s;o took, that the Court con|&s;ented to pay him for the &s;aid Service an hundred Pounds by the Chamberlain of <HI>London.</HI> And &s;ince this was very well known to <HI>T. Rudyard,</HI> in&s;omuch that in a Book he publi&s;hed, he named the Date of the &s;aid Order, <HI>viz.</HI> the Eighth of <HI>October,</HI> 1670; and that, other Orders that had been given for two Hundred Pounds more to him, within eight Months la&s;t pa&s;t; he, to reprehend &s;uch Doings in a Saty|rical Way, called them, <HI>An excellent Way to ea&s;e the Trea&s;ury of being over|burthened with Orphans-Money, by which &s;ini&s;ter Ends, and cur&s;ed Di&s;po&s;itions of its Ca&s;h, the Chamber was &s;o deeply in Debt, that it was almo&s;t incredible.</HI></P>
<P>Now &s;ince <HI>Rudyard</HI> as a Lawyer, had a more full Knowledge of the&s;e unlawful Proceedings again&s;t him and his Friends, than many others, he compo&s;ed a Treati&s;e of tho&s;e Pro&s;ecutions, which he called, <HI>The Second Part of the Peoples Ancient and Ju&s;t Liberties, a&s;&s;erted.</HI> And true Lovers of their Country were plea&s;ed with it: For that Party, which countenanced Popery, and therefore endeavoured to violate the People's Rights, &s;trove to get the upper Hand.</P>

So, my dear Friend, prize the great Love of God to thee who hath not given thy Life into the Hands of the Devourers, but hath given thee thy Life for a Prey, and Time to prepare thy &s;elf, that thou may'&s;t end thy Days in Peace. And truly the Lord is good to all them that fear him, and be|lieve in his Name. For tho' all the Powers of the Earth ri&s;e up again&s;t a poor innocent People, yet the Lord God of Life and Love was with them, and plead|ed their Cau&s;e, altho' all Men &s;lighted them: And tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, the be&s;t was but as a Brier, and the mo&s;t upright among them as a Thorn-b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dge. If the Lord had not pleaded our Innocency, we had not had a Being in the Land of our Nativity, Glory to his Name for ever, who hath not &s;uffered or permitted more of the Wrath of Man, nor Laws, nor Decrees of Men, to come again&s;t his People, that believe in his Name, than hath been for his Honour, and for his Glory, and for the eternal Good of all his Sons and Daughters, and Servants; and the Remainder the Lord God of Life and Love hath re&s;trained to this Day: Glory, and Honour, and living eternal Prai&s;es be given and returned to the Lord God, and the Lamb for ever! Thus <HI>Halhead</HI> ended his Speech, and <HI>Lambert,</HI> who had heard him with good Satisfaction, de&s;ired him to &s;it down, which <HI>Halhead</HI> did; and then <HI>Lambert</HI> called for Beer, and gave him to drink; after which he &s;aid to him, <HI>Friend, I do believe thou &s;peake&s;t to me in Love, and &s;o I take it.</HI> And then he asked him, <HI>if be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n as at</HI> Dunbar <HI>Fight?</HI> To which <HI>Halhead</HI> having an&s;wered, <HI>No;</HI> he further ask'd, <HI>How do you know what great Danger we were in at that Time?</HI> Upon which <HI>Halhead</HI> gave him to under&s;tand, <HI>That he coming that Way a little Time after the Fight, and having viewed the Town of</HI> Dunbar, <HI>and the Ground about it where the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Army lay, how the Sea was on the one Hand of them, and Hills and Mountains on the other, and the great</HI> Scotch <HI>Army before and behind them, he then took into &s;erious Con&s;ideration the great Danger the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>had been in, and thought how greatly the</HI> Engli&s;hmen <HI>were engaged to the Lord for their Deliverance to &s;erve him in Truth and &V;prightne&s;s of Heart all the Days of their Life. Truly</HI> John, &s;aid <HI>Halhead</HI> then to <HI>Lambert, I never &s;aw thy Face before to know thee, altho' I have been brought before many of our</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Commanders in the Time of</HI> Oliver Cromwel. <HI>Lambert</HI> then ask|ing, <HI>Who they were? Halhead</HI> named the Generals <HI>Fleetwood</HI> and <HI>Desborough,</HI> Major <HI>Blackmore,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Fenwick,</HI> before whom he had been when he was Governour of <HI>Edenburgh. Lambert</HI> then &s;aid, <HI>He knew the mo&s;t of tho&s;e Men to have been very moderate, and that they ever were again&s;t Per&s;e|cution.</HI> To which <HI>Myles</HI> replied, <HI>Indeed they were very moderate, and would not be much &s;een to per&s;ecute, or be &s;evere with the Lord's People; but truly they permitted others to do it, and took little Notice of the Sufferings of the People of God; &s;o that none were found to plead our Cau&s;e, but the Lord God.</HI> To this <HI>Lambert</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Altho you and your Friends &s;uffered Per&s;ecution, and &s;ome Hard&s;hips in that Time, your Cau&s;e therein is never the wor&s;e for that. That is very true,</HI> return'd <HI>Myles, but let me tell th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in the Plainne&s;s of my Heart, that's no Thanks to you, but Glory to the Lord for ever.</HI> About two Hours <HI>Myles</HI> di&s;cour&s;ed with <HI>Lambert</HI> and his Wife and two Daughters, and after he had cleared him&s;elf, he took Leave of them, and &s;o parted in Love.</P>
<P>Now before I leave <HI>Halhead,</HI> I'll in&s;ert here a Copy of a Letter he writ in the Year 1674, to <HI>G. F.</HI> who was then Pri&s;oner in <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI>-Jail. The &s;aid Letter was thus;</P>

<P>And now I feel the Truth of the Words that were &s;poke by Chri&s;t, <HI>That he that faileth in one Tittle, is guilty of all;</HI> and now I feel the Truth of that, <HI>That it is better to for&s;ake Wife and Children, and all a Man hath, even Life it &s;elf, for Chri&s;t and the Truth-&s;ake, than to break one Tittle of the Law of God written in the Heart.</HI> So I hope that by Mercy and Judgment the Lord will redeem me to him&s;elf again. The Lord may &s;uffer &s;ome to fall, that the &s;tanding of them that &s;tand faithful may &s;eem to be the more glorious, and for them to take heed le&s;t they fall.</P>
<P>Now I know and feel, that it is better to part with any Thing of

<P>It is remarkable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An in&s;tructive Digre&s;&s;ion on this Occa&s;ion.</NOTE> that this <HI>Chilton</HI> in the Conclu&s;ion of his Letter &s;aith, That <HI>His Bonds were greater than tho&s;e of his Friends,</HI> who neither feared a <HI>Praemunire,</HI> nor Lo&s;s of their Liberty, when they mu&s;t pay &s;o dear for it, as the taking of an Oath. For when any one truly abides in the Fear of God, he dares not again&s;t the Convictions of his Con&s;cience tran&s;|gre&s;s the Divine Commandments, and &s;eek Eva&s;ions to avoid the Stre&s;s thereof: For certainly God will not be mocked. Could our Saviour have &s;poken in more plain and expre&s;s Terms than he did, when he &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. v. 34.</NOTE> <HI>Swear not at all?</HI> And yet what cunning Devices have been invent|ed by tho&s;e who boa&s;t of the Name of Chri&s;tians, to enervate the Force of the&s;e expre&s;s Words. It is not a proper Place here to refute their Rea&s;ons; but yet I can't think it un&s;uitable to &s;hew briefly how dange|rous it is to act again&s;t the expre&s;s Commandments of Sacred Writ, and again&s;t the Conviction of one's Con&s;cience, thereby to avoid Per&s;ecution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">James ii. 10.</NOTE> For not only the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall offend in one Point, he is guilty of all;</HI> but our &s;upreme Lawgiver Chri&s;t him&s;elf &s;aith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. x. 33.</NOTE> <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall deny me before Men, him will I al&s;o deny before my Fa|ther which is in Heaven.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark viii. 38.</NOTE> And <HI>who&s;oever &s;hall be a&s;hamed of me, and of my Words, of him al&s;o &s;hall the Son of Man be a&s;hamed, when he cometh in the Glory of his Father, with the holy Angels.</HI> And to encourage us to Faithful|ne&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. x. 28.</NOTE> he hath al&s;o &s;aid, <HI>Fear not them which kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul; but rather fear him which is able to de&s;troy both Soul and Body in Hell.</HI> Which Words indeed are &s;o emphatical, that it ought not to di&s;plea&s;e any that I repeat them, as they have been left on Re|cord by the Evangeli&s;t <HI>Luke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke xii. 4, 5.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> thus, <HI>I &s;ay unto you my Friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the Body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom ye &s;hall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed, hath Power to ca&s;t into Hell; yea, I &s;ay unto you, Fear him.</HI> Can it be otherwi&s;e, but that &s;uch Words mu&s;t needs make a powerful Im|pre&s;&s;ion on a real Chri&s;tian; And the more when we con&s;ider, that nothing in the World can retrieve or re&s;tore a peri&s;hing Soul, as may appear from the&s;e Words of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, <HI>What is a Man profit|ed if he &s;hall gain the whole World, and lo&s;e his own Soul? Or what &s;hall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</HI> A clear Proof that the whole World, and all that is contained therein, is not able to &s;ave one Soul, or to af|ford any Thing that can redeem it. If I here thought it requi&s;ite, a godly Zeal at pre&s;ent would make me &s;ay more on this Subject; but not to ex&s;patiate too far beyond the Limits of this Hi&s;torical Tract, I &s;hall not pur&s;ue this Digre&s;&s;ion any farther, but return to my Relation from whence I thus &s;tept a&s;ide.</P>
<P>To take up again then the broken Thread of my Di&s;cour&s;e, I once more come to <HI>Jeremy Ives,</HI> who, to avoid Per&s;ecution, had taken the Oath contrary to his Under&s;tanding;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T.

One of the Leaders of this turbulent Company was the Son of one <HI>Abraham Seward,</HI> who about this Time was elected Mayor; but when Complaints were made to him of the outragious Actions of the &s;aid wicked Crew, he pretended to be ignorant of his Son's Doings, and for all that threatned tho&s;e that came to him, with the Execution of the Law upon them, if they did not leave off to keep Meetings. And as it was well known that the chief Ma&s;ter of the Town-School was di&s;plea&s;ed at the extravagant In&s;olency of &s;ome of his Scholars, &s;o it was reported al&s;o that he was forbidden to correct them for it; and that the College Prie&s;ts had &s;et them on, and &s;aid they would bear them out in what they did: For &s;ome of tho&s;e bruti&s;h Boys were Chori&s;ters.

And Matter of Fact could not be known but by the Relation of another, or by the Perception of the outward Sen&s;es; becau&s;e there are naturally in our Souls no Ideas of contingent Truths, &s;uch as are concerning nece&s;&s;ary Truths, <HI>viz.

Idea of God. He al&s;o &s;hews, <HI>Wherein the Motions of the Mind differ from tho&s;e of the Body; and that there are Ideas as well of &s;upernatural, as of natural Things.</HI> And &s;hewing from whence the Errors of fal&s;e Like|ne&s;&s;es of Rea&s;on proceed, he &s;ays, <HI>That the natural Rea&s;on cannot perceive &s;upernatural Things.</HI> He al&s;o a&s;&s;erts, <HI>That the Revelations to the Prophets were by inward In&s;pirations in their Minds; and that they were mo&s;t certainly per&s;waded that they were divinely in&s;pired, even without any outward Miracle. And that it is by the In&s;piration of the &s;ame Divine Spirit, by which the Pro|phets prophe&s;ied that we do believe their Words and Writings to be divine, con|cerning contingent Truths, as well pa&s;t as to come.</HI> Moreover he enquires, <HI>Whether Faith comes by outward Hearing, and he &s;hews how the outward Sen|&s;es may be deceived; nay, that often they are vitiated both by outward Ca&s;u|alties and natural Infirmities, whereunto the Godly are no le&s;s &s;ubject than the Wicked.</HI></P>

And it is no le&s;s ab&s;urd, to require of God, who is a mo&s;t pure Spirit, to manife&s;t his Will to Men by the outward Sen&s;es, el&s;e not to be credited; as to require us to &s;ee Sounds, and hear Light and Colours.

<P>If the Scripture then be true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">There is in all Men a <HI>&s;uper|natural Idea</HI> of God.</NOTE> there is in Men a <HI>&s;upernatural Idea</HI> of God, which altogether differs from this natural Idea: I &s;ay, <HI>in all Men;</HI> becau&s;e all Men are capable of Salvation, and con&s;equently of enjoy|ing this <HI>divine Vi&s;ion.</HI> Now this Capacity con&s;i&s;teth herein, that they have &s;uch a &s;upernatural Idea in them&s;elves: For if there were no &s;uch Idea in them, it were impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould &s;o know GOD. <HI>For what|&s;oever is clearly and di&s;tinctly known, is known by its proper Idea;</HI> neither can it otherways be clearly and di&s;tinctly known: For the Ideas of all Things are divinely planted in our Souls; for they are not begotten in us by outward Objects, or outward Cau&s;es, (as the better philo&s;o|phy teacheth) but only are by the&s;e outward Things excited or &s;tir|red up. And this is true not only in &s;upernatural Ideas of GOD and Things divine, and in natural Ideas of the natural Principles of humane Under&s;tanding, and Conclu&s;ions thence deduced by the Strength of humane Rea&s;on; but even in the Ideas of outward Objects, which are perceived by the outward Sen&s;es; as that noble Chri&s;tian Philo&s;opher <HI>Boetius</HI> hath well ob&s;erved;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Boetius</HI> a Chri&s;tian Phi|lo&s;opher.</NOTE> to which al&s;o the <HI>Carte&s;ian Philo&s;ophy</HI> agreeth. For when I &s;ee any outward Object, whe|ther it be a Man, or Hor&s;e, or Bird, the outward Object does not treat in my Eye, nor yet in my Mind the Idea of tho&s;e Things; for the outward Object does nothing but imprint in our &s;en&s;ible Organs a Corporeal Motion. Now there is nothing in a corporeal Mo|tion that can form in us the Ideas of tho&s;e Things;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Motions of the Body and Mind di&s;|tingui&s;hed.</NOTE> for all Ideas are of a &s;piritual Nature: Now nothing that is corporeal can produce that which is &s;piritual, becau&s;e <HI>The le&s;s Excellent cannot produce the more Excellent,</HI> el&s;e the Effect would exceed its Cau&s;e; which is again&s;t all &s;ound Rea&s;on, that it &s;hould bring forth what were of a higher and more excellent Kind. Therefore all Ideas, whether of natural or &s;piritual Things, are <HI>divinely implanted</HI> in our Minds; which never|thele&s;s do not always appear, but &s;ometimes appear, and &s;ometimes are as it were hid in us, and &s;ometimes are &s;tirred up in us by Cau&s;es outward or inward, and again do as it were &s;leep and &s;hun our Ob&s;er|vation, and &s;eem not to be otherways di&s;tingui&s;hed by our Minds, but as Thoughts and Perceptions of the Mind from the Mind it &s;elf; that is, as the Mode from the Subject, or as a bodily Motion from the Body, whereof it is the Motion: <HI>For as is the Relation of a bodily Motion to a Body, &s;o is the Relation of a Thought or Perception of the Mind to the Mind.</HI> In this neverthele&s;s they differ, that the <HI>Mind</HI> can move it &s;elf, and operate in it &s;elf; which a Body cannot do: But as a <HI>Body</HI> can be moved by another, &s;o al&s;o can the <HI>Mind</HI> after its Manner be moved by another, and that both by outward and inward Cau|&s;es, but chiefly by God him&s;elf, in who&s;e Hand all Souls and Crea|tures are.

<P>Now if there be &s;uch &s;upernatural Ideas, there are al&s;o Sen&s;es, or perceptive Faculties by which tho&s;e Ideas are perceived; for tho&s;e are two Relatives that &s;uppo&s;e and infer one another, but in wicked Men tho&s;e Sen&s;es or Faculties do as it were &s;leep (as the vi&s;ive Faculty of a blind Man) but in the Godly they are &s;tirred up.

And tho&s;e heavenly Enjoyments do as really differ in their Nature from all fal&s;e Similitudes, and fictitious Apppear|ances of them, which either the Mind of Man by its own Strength can imitate, or any evil Spirit to deceive Man can counterfeit; as a true Man differs from the dead Image of a Man; or true Bread, Ho|ney, Wine, or Milk doth from the meer Picture of tho&s;e Things. And albeit either the Imagination of Man, or Subtilty of the Devil, may counterfeit fal&s;e Likene&s;&s;es of the&s;e Enjoyments, by which Men may be deceived, and no Doubt many are deceived; that doth not hinder, but that tho&s;e divine Enjoyments are clearly perceived in &s;uch, in whom the divine and &s;piritual Sen&s;es are truly opened, and the true &s;upernatural Ideas of tho&s;e Things truly rai&s;ed up.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cau&s;e of <HI>Mi&s;takes</HI> by fal&s;e <HI>Like|ne&s;&s;es</HI> of <HI>Rea|&s;on.</HI></NOTE> And if there be at any Time a Mi&s;take, the divine Illumination is not the Cau&s;e of that Mi&s;take, but &s;ome evil Di&s;po&s;ition of the Mind; as hap|peneth in tho&s;e Things relating to <HI>natural Rea&s;on:</HI> For there are ma|ny fal&s;e Appearances of Rea&s;on, which differ as much from true Rea|&s;on, as tho&s;e fal&s;e and pretended Revelations, and diabolical In&s;pira-from &s;uch as are truly <HI>divine.</HI> Now, how many Men who would be e&s;teemed Philo&s;ophers, are mi&s;erably deceived by tho&s;e fal&s;e Like|ne&s;&s;es of Rea&s;on, judging their fal&s;e Rea&s;ons to be the true Simili|tudes of Things, and &s;olid Ratiocinations; which neverthele&s;s moveth no Man of &s;ound Rea&s;on to reject &s;ound and &s;olid Rea&s;on, as doubtful and uncertain?

one is deceived by fal&s;e Appearances of Rea&s;on, we endeavour to re|duce them to contemplate the fir&s;t natural Ideas of natural Things, and to meditate therein, which is as a Te&s;t or Touch-&s;tone, by which all the Appearances and Likene&s;&s;es of Rea&s;on are to be examined; if they contradict them, to be rejected. So al&s;o when any one is de|ceived by his own Imagination, or the Cunning of Satan, thinking any <HI>evil In&s;piration</HI> of the Devil to be a <HI>true divine Revelation,</HI> he that is &s;o deceived is to be reduced to the natural Ideas of Things (if &s;o be that pretended Revelation doth contradict them, for no true divine Revelation can contradict the true natural Ideas) or to the &s;upernatu|ral Ideas of <HI>divine Things,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>&s;uper|natural Ide|as</HI> of <HI>divine Things</HI> are mo&s;t clear and obvious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the Mind.</NOTE> which are mo&s;t &s;imple, clear, and obvious to the Minds of Men, if they will turn their Minds to the <HI>divine Seed</HI> in them; or at lea&s;t tho&s;e Ideas are readily and ea&s;ily &s;tirred up. For as in natural Ideas, &s;o in &s;upernatural &s;ome are more ea&s;ily rai&s;ed than others: For there is a certain Order both of natural and &s;uper|natural Ideas, whereby they are gradually excited: Nor is there any mortal Man, in who&s;e Mind at &s;ome Time or other there is not &s;tir|red up &s;ome Idea that is truly <HI>&s;upernatural</HI> and <HI>divine,</HI> and who hath not felt in him&s;elf both the Wrath and Judgment of God for his Sins.

Now that which is thought to be a <HI>divine Revelation,</HI> and is felt to contradict any <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>&s;upernatural Idea,</HI> which is clearly perceived in the Soul, it is a manife&s;t Token that it is not a <HI>divine Revelation,</HI> but either a fal&s;e Imagination, or the wicked Sugge&s;tion of &s;ome evil Spirit.</P>
<P>But to proceed: If we will hear the <HI>Scripture</HI> (as all Chri&s;tians ought) it te&s;tifies to us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God hath de|clared his Will even in <HI>contingent Truths</HI> in the Scripture.</NOTE> that GOD hath declared his Mind and Will even concerning <HI>contingent Truths to come,</HI> in the Prophets; as that of the fir&s;t to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> doth evidently declare: <HI>GOD, who at &s;undry Times, and in divers Manners &s;poke to our Fathers in the Prophets.</HI> Yea, let us hear the Prophets them&s;elves, <HI>Ho&s;ea,</HI> Chap. i. &s;aith plainly, <HI>That the Word of the LORD was made in him</HI> (as it is in the,<HI>Heb.) Habak|kuk</HI> al&s;o &s;ays,<HI>As he was &s;tanding on his Watch, to &s;ee what</HI> Jehovah <HI>would &s;peak in him.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Revelations</HI> were in the Minds of the Prophets by inward In&s;pi|rations.</NOTE> And it is &s;o manife&s;t, that the mo&s;t <HI>heavenly Revelations</HI> are by <HI>inward Illu&s;trations</HI> and <HI>In&s;pirations</HI> in the very Minds of the Pro|phets; that it is &s;trange how any that believes the Scripture &s;hould doubt of it. And if it happened at any Time, &s;uch Revelations were made in the natural Imaginations of the Prophets, or any of their in|ward natural Sen&s;es; then it may be confe&s;&s;ed, they could not be in|fallibly certain, they came from <HI>GOD,</HI> unle&s;s they al&s;o felt God in the <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Supernatural Sen&s;es,</HI> by which they did mo&s;t nearly ap|proach to him, from the&s;e &s;uperior and mo&s;t inward Sen&s;es working upon the lower and le&s;s noble Faculties of the Mind. But which ever Way the Prophets were certain, that they were <HI>In&s;pired of GOD,</HI> even when they foretold Contingent Truths to come; it is without Doubt, they were mo&s;t certainly per&s;waded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which were mo&s;t certain without any outward mi|raculous De|mon&s;trations.</NOTE> that they were divinely in&s;pired, and that frequently without any outward Miracle. For <HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI> did no Miracle; and many prophe&s;ied, where there apppear|ed no Miracle, as in the Scripture may be often ob&s;erved. And we al&s;o by the <HI>In&s;piration of the &s;ame divine Spirit,</HI> by which the Prophets prophe&s;ied, do believe their Words and Writings to be <HI>divine</HI> concer|ning contingent Truths, as well pa&s;t as to come; el&s;e that Faith, by which we believe the Scripture, would not be <HI>divine,</HI> but <HI>meerly hu|mane.</HI> And thence we need no outward Miracles to move us to be|lieve the Scriptures; and therefore much le&s;s were they nece&s;&s;ary to the Prophets who writ them. For we &s;ee in many Places of the Pro|phets,
<PB N="526" REF="003104_0537_0FEFF807F8377AC0">
where they declare Prophecies as revealed to them of <HI>GOD,</HI> there is not a Word mentioned of any outward Miracle, as that by which alone they were certain of it. Moreover, the Fal&s;ene&s;s of this Argument doth appear, in that the Scripture doth declare many con|tingent Truths to have been revealed to the Prophets in Dreams:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Divine Re|velations by Dreams.</NOTE> Now as natural and wicked Men do not &s;ee what they dream by a real Per|ception of the outward Sen&s;es, but by inward Ideas which are pre&s;ent|ed to the Mind, and perceived by it; &s;o it is al&s;o in <HI>divine Revelations</HI> of this Nature. Of which we have a clear Example in <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> the Husband of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, who, when he ob&s;erved his Wife with Child, was told in a Dream, That &s;he had conceived by the Holy Gho&s;t: Now I would know, to which of <HI>Jo&s;eph's outward Sen&s;es</HI> was this revealed? Or what Miracle had he to induce him to believe? Which could neither be proved, (&s;o as to make an infallible Appli|cation to <HI>Mary</HI>) by the Te&s;timony of the Scripture; and which being again&s;t the Order of Nature, did choak his Rea&s;on. The Scripture mentions no Miracle in this Matter; and yet no doubt <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> had highly &s;inned had he not believed this Revelation, and notwith&s;tand|ing rejected his Wife as an Adultere&s;s. But if thou &s;ay'&s;t, That ac|cording to thy <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> there mu&s;t have been a Miracle; that is on|ly to beg the Que&s;tion: And how fal&s;e this <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> is, the Apo&s;tle &s;hews clearly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The outward Sen&s;es cannot di&s;cern the Things of God, for they are &s;piritual.</NOTE> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 14. <HI>The natural or animal Man knoweth not, re|ceiveth not the Things of GOD.</HI> Now <HI>divine Revelations</HI> are of this Na|ture; and if either chiefly or only tho&s;e Things were to be judged by the outward Sen&s;es, it would contradict the Apo&s;tle. For <HI>natural Men</HI> yea, the <HI>mo&s;t Wicked</HI> have the U&s;e of the outward Sen&s;es as true and exact as the <HI>mo&s;t Godly.</HI> And whereas the Apo&s;tle adds, <HI>For they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned,</HI> it puts the Matter out of all Que&s;tion: For thence it abundantly appears, that this Di&s;cerning is not by the outward Sen|&s;es, according to the following Ver&s;e; for the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>The &s;pi|ritual Man judgeth all Things:</HI> This then mu&s;t be done by &s;ome Sen&s;es or Properties peculiar to the &s;piritual Man, and in which he excels the natural Man, which is not in the outward Sen&s;es (as all do know) Therefore the Perception of <HI>&s;piritual Things cannot be by the outward Sen|&s;es, either as the chief or only Means,</HI> as is fals;ly contended for.</P>
<P>Now as to the&s;e Words of the Apo&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether Faith comes by the out|ward Hear|ing.</NOTE> <HI>Rom.</HI> x. <HI>That Faith comes by Hearing, Zuinglius</HI> ob&s;erved well, That the Apo&s;tle intended not to af|firm <HI>Faith</HI> to come by the Hearing of the <HI>outward Word;</HI> neither do the following Words prove it, <HI>How &s;hall they believe, unle&s;s they hear? And how &s;hall they hear without a Preacher? And how &s;hall they preach unle&s;s they be &s;ent?</HI> For the Apo&s;tle u&s;es the&s;e Words, not as his Arguments, but as Objections which might be formed; as the &s;ame Apo&s;tle u&s;es in other Places; to which Objections he an&s;wers in the &s;ame Chapter, as appears, <HI>ver.</HI> 18. <HI>But I &s;ay, have they not all heard?

For if thou acknowledge Faith can be be|gotten any otherwi&s;e than by Hearing, thou lo&s;e&s;t the Strength of thy Argument: And if that Argument hold, <HI>That Faith comes only by outward Hearing,</HI> thou de&s;troye&s;t the whole <HI>Hypothe&s;is.</HI> For having be|fore affirmed, <HI>That outward Miracles are &s;ufficient to render one certain of

the Truth of any Revelation;</HI> tho&s;e Miracles, whether it be the Healing of the Sick, or the Rai&s;ing of the Dead, would avail nothing, becau&s;e tho&s;e (as for the mo&s;t Part all Miracles,) are obvious to the <HI>Sight,</HI> not to the <HI>Hearing:</HI> And if it be not by <HI>outward Hearing</HI> only, thou can&s;t conclude nothing from this Place.</P>
<P>But I the more wonder thy u&s;ing of this Argument, con&s;idering the Di&s;cour&s;e we had together before we entred upon this Debate: For when we were &s;peaking of the Opinion of a certain Per&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A certain Per&s;on pla|cing the Cer|tainty of eve|ry Thing in the outward Sen&s;es.</NOTE> who de|nied the Certainty of every Thing, but what was di&s;cerned by the outward Sen&s;es, thou condemned&s;t it as mo&s;t ab&s;urd; But <HI>why</HI> I can|not conceive, &s;ince there is no great Difference betwixt tho&s;e two Opi|nions: The one &s;aith, <HI>There can be no great Certainty concerning any Truths, whether they be</HI> nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>or</HI> contingent, <HI>but by the Perception of the Sen&s;es:</HI> The other affirms the &s;ame of contingent Truths, tho' not of nece&s;|&s;ary Truths. But among the Number of contingent Truths, thou e&s;teeme&s;t what belongs to Chri&s;tian Religion; for thou reckons the nece&s;&s;ary Truths only to belong to natural Religion. This then is all the Difference, that that other Per&s;on &s;ays, There is no Certainty of any Religion, neither natural nor Chri&s;tian, but by the Perception of the outward Sen&s;es: But thou &s;ay'&s;t, Tho' thou e&s;teeme&s;t the Cer|tainty of natural Religion to be without them, yet not of the Chri|&s;tian Religion. But again, &s;ince thou e&s;teeme&s;t, that not natural Re|ligion, but the Chri&s;tian Religion is nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation; thou mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily conclude, That tho&s;e Truths which are nece&s;&s;ary to Sal|vation, are only known and believed by the Benefit of the outward Sen&s;es: In which Conclu&s;ion (which is the Sum af all) thou yielde&s;t the Matter to that other Per&s;on.</P>
<P>But la&s;tly: If all the Certainty of our <HI>Faith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Outward Sen|&s;es can be de|ceived.</NOTE> <HI>Hope,</HI> and <HI>Salvation</HI> did depend upon the <HI>Infallibility</HI> of <HI>outward Sen&s;es,</HI> we &s;hould be mo&s;t mi|&s;erable; &s;ince the&s;e Sen&s;es can be ea&s;ily deceived, and by many out|ward Ca&s;ualties, and natural Infirmities, whereunto the Godly are no le&s;s &s;ubject than the Wicked, are often vitiated; and there are (as the Scripture affirms,) <HI>fal&s;e Miracles,</HI> which, as to the outward, cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the true; of which we cannot infallibly judge by the outward Sen&s;es, which only di&s;cern what is outward,</P>

<P>From all which it does appear, how fallacious and weak this Ar|gument is: But Thanks be unto GOD, who would not that our Faith &s;hould be built upon &s;o uncertain and doubtful a Foundation.

<P>AS to his Argument, as it was tran&s;mitted to us, if he con&s;i|ders the Strength and Sub&s;tance of it, thus it &s;tands; <HI>The Hi&s;|tory of the outward Coming, Nativity, Death, Re&s;urrection and A&s;cen&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is either nece&s;&s;ary to their Salvation, to whom the Scriptures came, or it is not nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> viz. <HI>to be known and believed: If we &s;ay the</HI> Second, <HI>namely, That that Hi&s;tory is not nece&s;&s;ary to be known and believed in order to the Salvation of us</HI> Europeans <HI>who have the Scriptures, then it will follow that we are not</HI> Chri&s;tians; <HI>becau&s;e we deny that True, E&s;&s;ential and Con&s;tituti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Character of the</HI> Chri&s;tian Religion, <HI>which con&s;i&s;ts in believing that Chri&s;t was &s;ent into the World, Born of the Virgin</HI> Mary, <HI>Dead and Buried, Ro&s;e again the Third Day, A&s;cended into Heaven, where he &s;itteth at the Right Hand of the Father,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But if we &s;ay the</HI> Fir&s;t, viz. <HI>That the Knowledge and Faith of the Hi&s;tory are nece&s;&s;ary to our Salvation; then it will follow, that the Scripture, and not the inward Revelation of the Holy Spirit, is the Principal Rule and Foundation of that Hi&s;torical Faith and Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>Now this he endeavours to prove, both from &s;ome other Principles of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, and from <HI>R. B</HI>'s &s;ixth <HI>The&s;is,</HI> after this Man|ner.</P>
<P><HI>That,</HI> &s;aid the Amba&s;&s;ador, <HI>is the principal Rule and Foundation of our Faith, which is the only</HI> Medium <HI>or</HI> Mean, <HI>whereby that Hi&s;torical Knowledge and Faith are brought unto us: But, according to the</HI> Quakers, <HI>and the &s;ixth</HI> The&s;is, <HI>the Scripture is the only</HI> Medium <HI>or</HI> Mean, <HI>whereby that Hi&s;torical Knowledge and Faith are brought unto us: Therefore, according to the</HI> Quakers, <HI>and the &s;ixth</HI> The&s;is, <HI>the Scripture is the Principal Rule and Foundation of our Faith.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Minor</HI> he proves thus; <HI>The Author of the</HI> The&s;es (&s;ays he) <HI>con|fe&s;&s;eth in his &s;ixth</HI> The&s;is, <HI>That there is a People, to whom God, by &s;ome</HI> ine|vitable Accident, <HI>hath made that Hi&s;torical Knowledge and Faith impo&s;&s;ible: And the Rea&s;on why that Hi&s;torical Knowledge and Faith are impo&s;&s;ible to that People, is, becau&s;e they are de&s;titute of the Scriptures, and live in tho&s;e Corners of the World, whereunto the outward Preaching of the Hi&s;tory never came; from which Argument it will follow, that the Scriptures are the only</HI> Medium <HI>or</HI> Mean, <HI>whereby the Hi&s;torical Knowledge and Faith of Chri&s;t came to any People.</HI></P>
<P>For the clearer under&s;tanding the Solution of this Argument, &s;ome Things worthy Ob&s;ervation are to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then ob&s;erve, that the Force of this Argument at mo&s;t in|tends to prove this, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Scripture is the Principal Rule and Foundation of Hi&s;torical Faith and Knowledge; but we with good Rea&s;on di&s;tingui&s;h between <HI>Hi&s;torical</HI> and <HI>Saving Knowledge,</HI> and between <HI>Hi&s;torical</HI> and <HI>Saving Faith;</HI> becau&s;e many may have an <HI>Hi&s;torical Know|ledge and Faith,</HI> who have not that which is <HI>Saving.</HI> Yea, it is po&s;&s;ible, that a Man, by the inward Revelation of the Holy Spirit, may have an <HI>Hi&s;torical Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Faith,</HI> who yet may not have that Faith which is <HI>Saving;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Saving Faith</HI> hath regard to God, not preci&s;ely, as revealing &s;ome outward Hi&s;tory concerning God and Chri&s;t, but as Revealing very <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by his Grace, Goodne&s;s, Mercy, and
<PB N="529" REF="003104_0540_0FEFF84F900DB9D8">
Power, ready and willing to &s;ave us, according to his un&s;peakable Good|will towards us; by which <HI>Saving Faith</HI> we re&s;t upon God thro' <HI>Chri&s;t, our Light and Life,</HI> as upon our mo&s;t merciful Father; which Faith can neither exi&s;t, nor be conceived without Love to God, Humility be|fore God, Denial and Di&s;&s;idence of Self; and therefore &s;uch a Faith is <HI>Saving.</HI> But <HI>Hi&s;torical Faith,</HI> tho' wrought in the Hearts of Men by the inward Revelation and Operation of the Holy Spirit, may be without that Divine Love, Humility and Self-denial: Wherefore pre|ci&s;ely con&s;idered in its own Nature, it is not <HI>Saving.</HI> 'Twas this kind of Knowledge and Faith which wicked <HI>Balaam</HI> had, who &s;aw and knew many Hi&s;torical Futurities, and believed them, but had not <HI>Saving Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Ob&s;erve, <HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Knowledge and Faith nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation are to be under&s;tood two Ways, either by a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity Antece|dent,</HI> or <HI>in Way of Priority,</HI> or by a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity Con&s;equent</HI> or <HI>in Way of Po|&s;teriority. Nece&s;&s;ity Antecedent,</HI> or <HI>in Way of Priority,</HI> is, when &s;ome|thing is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our Salvation, that we both know and believe it; and becau&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary, God doth therefore reveal it to us; of which Sort are &s;uch Principles as the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That God fol|lows Men with his Love and Good-will; that he invites and per&s;wades them to come unto him; that he is ready to &s;hew Favour to Men, and pardon their Sins, if they &s;incerely repent them&s;elves of their pa&s;t mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|pent Life, and lead a new one for the Time to come; that God hears the Prayers of tho&s;e that are truly humble and &s;uppliant; that he is a glorious Rewarder of all that live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly; that he is a mo&s;t ju&s;t Avenger again&s;t all tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e his Grace and Love, and repent not of their Sins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All which, in &s;ome Degree, are to all Men, even to tho&s;e who are de&s;titute of the Scriptures, reveal|ed by that inward <HI>Evangelical Light,</HI> which <HI>enlightens all Men. Nece&s;&s;ity Con&s;equent</HI> or <HI>in Way of Po&s;teriority,</HI> is, when &s;omething is not ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary to our Salvation, but after a certain Sort, or under &s;ome Re&s;pect, Condition and Limitation; of which Kind are tho&s;e Things which are not revealed, becau&s;e they are nece&s;&s;ary; but becau&s;e they are revealed, they are nece&s;&s;ary to be believed by us: For Example; if God &s;hould reveal to any Man, that it was his Will and Command, he &s;hould go to <HI>Rome</HI> to reprove Tyranny and Super&s;tition; certainly this Revelation were nece&s;&s;ary to be believed to that Man's Salvation, by a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity Con&s;equent,</HI> becau&s;e that Faith is an Act of Obedience; and to obey God is nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation.</P>
<P N="3">3. Ob&s;erve in the Third Place, That among tho&s;e Things that are nece&s;&s;ary to be believed to Salvation by a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity Con&s;equent,</HI> there are &s;ome Things, tho' not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, yet are they very profita|ble and conducive Means to our Salvation; of which Sort are the Hi|&s;torical Knowledge and Faith concerning God, the Creation and Go|vernment of the World, Chri&s;t's taking Fle&s;h, and dying therein for our Sins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whether that <HI>Hi&s;torical Knowledge</HI> come to us, either by the &s;ole inward Revelation of the Holy Spirit, without the <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Mean</HI> of Scripture, or al&s;o by both, to wit, both by the inward In&s;pi|ration of the Holy Spirit, and by the Scriptures; which two <HI>Mediums</HI> or <HI>Means</HI> do &s;ometimes concur in producing in Men <HI>Hi&s;torical Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> concerning God and Chri&s;t, as is &s;aid before, but in a diffe|rent Manner. The outward Revelation (as 'tis called) of Scripture is a <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Mean,</HI> by Way of <HI>Material Object,</HI> in producing that <HI>Hi|&s;torical Knowledge and Faith:</HI> But the inward In&s;piration and Revelation wrought in the Hearts of Men by the Holy Spirit, are a <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Mean</HI> by way of <HI>Formal Object,</HI> in producing the &s;ame <HI>Hi&s;torical Know|ledge</HI>
<PB N="530" REF="003104_0541_0FEFF80EFB42BB08">
and <HI>Faith.</HI> By the <HI>Material Object,</HI> we under&s;tand that which is believed; and therefore the Scriptures, which are believed, are the <HI>Material Object</HI> of <HI>Hi&s;torical Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Faith.</HI> By the <HI>Formal Object,</HI> we under&s;tand the principal Motive <HI>in re&s;pect of the Object, for which</HI> the Scriptures are believed. But the Principal Motive <HI>in re&s;pect of the Object</HI> is not the Scripture it &s;elf, but that inward Te&s;timony of the Holy Spirit, which when we hear or read the Scriptures (when it plea&s;eth the mo&s;t good and great God to in&s;pire the Hearts of Men) works an A&s;&s;ent in us, whether it inclines us to a&s;&s;ent to the Hi&s;torical Truths hitherto declared in the Scriptures or no: Wherefore we do not affirm that the Holy Spirit doth ordinarily and commonly &s;peak in us &s;omething that is <HI>New,</HI> or declare to our inward Hearing tho&s;e par|ticular Hi&s;tories of God and Chri&s;t (tho' God may, if he &s;hall plea&s;e, do it at this Day;) but we &s;ay, that God doth by his Holy Spirit, thro' his &s;en&s;ible and perceptible Motions and Operations Objectively repre&s;enting them&s;elves, move and incline us to a&s;&s;ent unto and believe the Scriptures and the Hi&s;torical Truths declared of in the Scriptures.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things con&s;ider'd, we affirm, that tho' the Scriptures are ordi|narily and commonly a certain <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Mean</HI> by way of <HI>Material Ob|ject</HI> or Condition, for the producing of <HI>Hi&s;torical Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> in us, and that, commonly &s;peaking, a nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Mean</HI> too, as being that without which God doth not ordinarily reveal the outward Hi&s;tory of God and Chri&s;t; yet we utterly deny that in true Chri&s;tians, the Scripture or outward Hi&s;tory in the Scriptures, is the Principal Mo|tive, Foundation or Principal Rule of that <HI>Hi&s;torical Faith,</HI> much le&s;s of <HI>Saving Faith,</HI> to the Producing of which the Letter of the Scrip|ture doth very frequently (as to many of its Acts, if not all) not con|cur or co-operate, either as a <HI>Material Object,</HI> or as a nece&s;&s;ary Condi|tion, which is wont commonly to be called in the <HI>Schools, Cau&s;a &s;ine qua non,</HI> or a Cau&s;e or Condition without which a Thing cannot be done, tho' it doth not influence the Effect.</P>
<P>Now for a direct Solution of the Argument afore&s;aid, We an&s;wer, that the <HI>Hi&s;torical Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> concerning Chri&s;t's being Born, Dead, Buried, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to us <HI>Europeans,</HI> who have the Scriptures, are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to Salvation, that is to &s;ay, by a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity Con&s;equent,</HI> or in <HI>Way of Po&s;teriority,</HI> (as was before explained) which A&s;&s;ertion of ours ne|verthele&s;s militates not again&s;t the <HI>Sixth The&s;is,</HI> which granteth, that that <HI>Hi&s;torical Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> are impo&s;&s;ible to tho&s;e who live in tho&s;e Corners of the World, where the Knowledge of the Hi&s;tory is wanting; which Impo&s;&s;ibility is not ab&s;olutely to be under&s;tood, but after a Sort, and in &s;ome Re&s;pect; becau&s;e without Doubt God doth ordinarily communicate that Hi&s;torical Knowledge unto Men, by the <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Mean</HI> of the Scriptures; yet not as by the Principal <HI>Me|dium</HI> or <HI>Mean,</HI> much le&s;s as by the <HI>only</HI> one: Becau&s;e certainly that in|ward Motion of the Holy Spirit wrought in our Hearts, moving and inclining us <HI>Objectively</HI> to a&s;&s;ent unto and believe the Scriptures, is the Principal Motive <HI>in re&s;pect of the Object, for which</HI> we believe the Scrip|tures, and therefore is the Foundation and Principal Rule of our <HI>Hi&s;to|rical Faith</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>Wherefore we an&s;wer unto the <HI>Minor Propo&s;ition</HI> of the la&s;t <HI>Syllogi&s;m,</HI> by plainly and directly denying that <HI>Minor Propo&s;ition, viz.</HI> That the Scriptures are the only <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Mean</HI> for attaining to the Knowledge of the Hi&s;tory: They are indeed one certain <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Mean,</HI> and that nece&s;&s;ary; but they are not the <HI>only</HI> nor principal. An Example for the Illu&s;tration hereof occurs in Natural and Outward Vi&s;ion: For when I &s;ee a white or red Ro&s;e, that white or red Ro&s;e is the <HI>Material Object</HI>
<PB N="531" REF="003104_0542_0FEFF851E64A0080">
of my Sight, and one nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Medium</HI> for the producing of that Sight; yet that Ro&s;e is not the only <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Mean;</HI> for the Light is another, no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, concurring to produce my Sight, by way of <HI>Formal Object,</HI> by Means of which I &s;ee that Ro&s;e repre&s;ented under &s;uch or &s;uch a Colour and Figure. Moreover, in that he a&s;&s;erts, <HI>The&s;e inward Motions wrought by the Holy Spirit in the Hearts of Believers, are &s;o undi&s;cernible by us, that Believers cannot clearly and infallibly di&s;tingui&s;h them from their own private and proper Motions:</HI> This he &s;uppo&s;es, but proves not. And therein he is deceived, either thro' his Inexperience, or Want of that due Waiting, and Attention to tho&s;e Motions in the Divine Illumination of Chri&s;t, wherewith he hath enlightened both him [the <HI>Amba&s;&s;ador</HI>] and all Men coming into the World. But our Experience, together with the Experience of the Holy Prophets and Apo&s;tles, is a &s;tronger Motive to induce us to believe, that Divine, In|ward Revelation is &s;ufficiently clear and convincing by its own Light and Evidence, than his own bare and jejune Suppo&s;ition to the contra|ry, by rea&s;on of his Want of Experience or Attention.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Latin,</HI> we have not been very curious in this Writing, by rea&s;on of Ha&s;te; yet have briefly an&s;wered the Argument as a Friend communicated it to us by Letter; if he hath omitted any Thing in his Tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion, or we may &s;eem not to have under&s;tood or touch'd the Strength of the Argument, let it be remitted to us; and we, thro' Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;hall an&s;wer it at large.</P>

<P>The Argument is thus formed; <HI>Such an Evidence as is a&s;&s;erted in the</HI> The&s;is, <HI>is de&s;tructive of Faith, becau&s;e it is not the Evidence of Faith.</HI> He proves the <HI>Antecedent</HI> by the Words of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Faith is the Evidence of Things not &s;een,</HI> Heb. xi. 1. By which Words the Apo&s;tle &s;eems to in|timate, <HI>That Faith hath not this Kind of Evidence; for if it were of Things &s;een, it would contradict the Apo&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P>The Solution of this Argument is ea&s;ie; for Evidence is three-fold.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t is <HI>the Evidence of Things &s;en&s;ible,</HI> appertaining to the out|ward Sen&s;es.</P>

Penn,</HI> that &s;he wi&s;h'd a Meeting might be had where the inferior Servants might freely appear. <HI>W. Penn</HI> not refu&s;ing this, the Prince&s;s con&s;ented to it; and after the Meeting, (where &s;he was not her&s;elf, that &s;o her Servants might have a more free Acce&s;s) &s;he expre&s;t much Satisfaction in having had that good Opportunity. And then &s;o earne&s;tly invited <HI>W. Penn</HI> and <HI>R. Barclay,</HI> (who lodged at an Inn) to &s;up with her, that they not being well able to refu&s;e the Invitation, yielded to it. There was then with her a <HI>French</HI> Woman of Quality, who having had before a very &s;light Opinion of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> now be|came deeply broken, and very affectionately kind and re&s;pectful to <HI>W. Penn</HI> and <HI>R. Barclay.</HI> The next Day was the Fir&s;t of the Week; and it being agreed with the Prince&s;s to have another Meeting, <HI>W. Penn</HI> de&s;ired that not only as many of her own Family, but as many of the Town as would willingly be there, might be admitted. To this &s;he yielded. And thus <HI>W. Penn</HI> and <HI>R. Barclay</HI> had a large Opportunity to preach effectually, and to di&s;charge them&s;elves. After the Meeting was done, the Prince&s;s came to <HI>W. Penn,</HI> and taking him by the Hand, &s;he &s;poke to him of the Sen&s;e &s;he had of the Power and Pre&s;ence of God that had been among them; and thus going on &s;he broke forth into an extraordinary Pa&s;&s;ion, crying out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Afterwards take their &s;olemn Leave, and <HI>Barclay</HI> returns to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> while <HI>Penn</HI> goes to <HI>Pader|horn, Ca&s;&s;el</HI> &amp; <HI>Frankford,</HI> where he has a Meeting at the Hou&s;e of <HI>J.

Pray call here as ye return out of</HI> Germany. To this he returned, <HI>We are in the Hand of the Lord, and being at his Plea&s;ure, cannot &s;o fully di&s;po&s;e of our &s;elves.</HI> Solemn Leave then being taken, <HI>R.

Verily this <HI>Dilemma</HI> is not ea&s;ily avoided, as well as that this inhuman Practice will &s;tain your Profe&s;&s;ion, infame your Government, and bring a Blot upon your Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Remember that they are Men as well as your &s;elves, born free, and have equal Plea to Natural and Civil common Priviledges with your &s;elves: The different Per&s;ua&s;ion of their Con&s;ciences about Things relating to another Life, can no ways render them unfit for this; it neither unmans nor uncivilizes them. They have the &s;ame Right to their Liberty and Property as ever, having by no Practice of theirs in the lea&s;t forfeited any of tho&s;e human Advantages, the Great Charters of Nature and Scripture have conferred upon them: And the <HI>Opulency</HI> of your Neighbours, and <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> of their Affairs, prove to you that <HI>Indul|gence</HI> is not incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Policy;</HI> howbeit, you have now tried the <HI>Sincerity</HI> of their Pro|cedure by what you have already inflicted, and they &s;u&s;tained. Let the Time pa&s;t &s;uffice, and make them not Sacrifices for their con&s;ciencious <HI>Con&s;tancy.</HI> If they are in the wrong, 'tis more than they know: Will you per&s;ecute Men for being what they mu&s;t be, if they will be true to them&s;elves? this were great Violence; rather commi&s;erate, than thus violently compel them. I be&s;eech you &s;eek &s;ome cheaper Way to accommodate your &s;elves, than by their De&s;truction, who are &s;o very remote from &s;eeking yours. <HI>Oh! the Day will come, wherein one Act of Tenderne&s;s about Matters of Con&s;cience, &s;hall find a better Reward, than all the Severity by which Men u&s;e to propagate their Per&s;ua&s;ions in the World;</HI> and there is great Rea&s;on for it, &s;ince the one flows from the <HI>Saviour,</HI> the other, from the <HI>De&s;troyer of Men.</HI> In fine, <HI>Let your Moderation be known unto all Men, for the Lord is at hand, who&s;e Reward is with him; and he will recompence every</HI> Man, Family, State, Kingdom, and Empire, <HI>according to</HI> the Na|ture of <HI>their Works, committed in this mortal Body;</HI> at who&s;e Bar it &s;hall never be laid to your Charge, that out of Fear of taking God's Office out of his Hands, and being unmerciful to tender Con&s;ciences, you admitted Men of differing Judgments to dwell quietly among you; truly you cannot be too tender in this Point.</P>
<P>Imitate the <HI>God</HI> of Nature and Grace, by being propitious to all; <HI>his Sun &s;hineth on all, his Rain falls on all, he gives Life and Being to all; his Grace vi&s;its all, and in Times of Ignorance he winketh:</HI> And tho' &s;uch you may repute ours, I hope you cannot think you wink at it, who make &s;uch broad Tokens of your Di&s;plea&s;ure. Oh! How forbearing and merciful is he towards you? Have you &s;o lately e&s;caped the Wrath of Enemies, and can you already thus &s;harply treat your Friends? Had he enter'd into Judgment with you, what had become of you?

that the &s;aid, <HI>I am fully convinced; but oh my Sins are great!</HI> This gave Occa&s;ion to <HI>W.

Being much pre&s;s'd by the Prince&s;s to &s;tay and &s;up with her, he yielded: And the Counte&s;s from a &s;erious Sen&s;e of her Compliance with the World, told him, <HI>Il faut que je rompe, il faut que je rompe,</HI> i. e. <HI>I mu&s;t break off, I mu&s;t break off.</HI> And at another Time with a weighty Countenance &s;he cry'd out, <HI>O the Cumber and Entanglements of this vain World! They hinder all Good.</HI> Once the Prince&s;s &s;aid to him, <HI>It is a hard Matter to be faithful to what one knows. I fear that I am not weighty enough in my Spirit.</HI> At another Time &s;he told him, <HI>Among my Books I have Records that the Go&s;pel was by the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>fir&s;t brought from</HI> England <HI>into</HI> Germany; <HI>and now it is come again.</HI> Thus this excellent Prince&s;s &s;ignified how highly &s;he valued the Preaching of the Go&s;pel to her by <HI>W.

When he took his Leave of the&s;e eminent Per&s;ons, ha|ving taken the Prince&s;s by the Hand, which &s;he received with a weighty Kindne&s;s, being much broken in Spirit, he wi&s;h'd <HI>the Ble&s;&s;ing and Peace of Je&s;us with and upon her:</HI> And then exhorting the Counte&s;s, &s;he fre|quently be&s;eeched him, <HI>to remember her, and implore the Lord on her Be|half.</HI></P>

I well know that therein they wronged him.

Of &s;everal other true Prophets we find not the lea&s;t Mention of any Mira|cles they did;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. xiii. 1, 2.</NOTE> but on the contrary the Scriptures &s;ignify, that po&s;&s;ibly fal&s;e Prophets might ari&s;e and give Signs or Wonders; and that the doing of Miracles could not always be a Proof or &s;ure Evidence that any one was &s;ent of God, appears plainly from what our Saviour him&s;elf &s;aid, <HI>viz.</HI> that among tho&s;e to whom he &s;hould one Day &s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. vii. 22.</NOTE> <HI>Depart from me,</HI> would be &s;uch that &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>Have we not in thy Name ca&s;t out Devils, and in thy Name done many wonderful Works?</HI> And what &s;hall we think of the Sorcerers of <HI>Egypt?</HI> Did not they &s;eem to do the &s;ame Wonders as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> did? And yet tho&s;e Wonders wherewithal they deceived <HI>Pharoah</HI> and his Men, were in no wi&s;e wrought by a divine Power. Now &s;ince it appears plainly from the holy Scriptures, and Chri&s;t him|&s;elf &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xxiv. 24.</NOTE> <HI>There &s;hall ari&s;e fal&s;e Prophets, and &s;hall &s;hew great Signs and Wonders,</HI> we might with good Rea&s;on &s;u&s;pect the Doctrine of one, who now-a-days wrought Miracles, on purpo&s;e to make what he denounced to pa&s;s for Truth. This being duly con&s;idered, it &s;eems to be very ab|&s;urd, to require Miracles again for Confirmation of the &s;ame Go&s;pel which once hath been confirmed by Miracles, and to de&s;ire that the Truth of what once hath been declared by the Apo&s;tles, and &s;trengthned by wonderful Works, &s;hould be &s;ealed a-new with outward Wonders. But it would indeed have been another Ca&s;e, if a new Go&s;pel was preached, and that any pretended to give forth new holy Scriptures; for then it might be &s;aid with &s;ome Rea&s;on, that it was nece&s;&s;ary that this new Go&s;pel &s;hould be made credible, and confirmed by vi&s;ible Miracles. But where no other Go&s;pel is preached, than what hath been once delivered to the Chri&s;tians by the fir&s;t Promulgators of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and where this is not done among&s;t Heathens, but among&s;t Chri&s;tians, or at lea&s;t &s;uch as bear the Name, there it cannot in Ju&s;tice be required to confirm this Doctrine once more with Miracles; the rather becau&s;e, as hath been &s;hewed already, the doing of Miracles may not always pa&s;s for an irre|fragable Proof of One's being really pious and godly. To this may be added, that the Miracles which Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles wrought to give Credit to the Appearing of the Son of God in the Fle&s;h, may be con&s;idered as Types and Figures of tho&s;e &s;piritual Wonders which &s;hould be wrought in the Souls of People, when Chri&s;t was to be &s;een the &s;econd Time, and to appear by his Spirit, to the Salvation of tho&s;e who wait for him; for the Eyes of the Mind being blinded, mu&s;t be o|pened and enlightened by him; and many that are dead in Sin and Tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es, &s;hall by him be rai&s;ed, and made alive. This I think may &s;uf|fice to &s;hew, that the Po&s;ition of Dr.<HI>Galenus</HI> could not &s;tand the Te&s;t: But whatever was objected, he continued to maintain his Opinion.</P>

<P><HI>G.

<P>In the latter Part of this Year <HI>G. F.</HI> travelled thro' many Places of <HI>England;</HI> in the mean while I'll again make &s;ome Mention of the Per|&s;ecution there. At <HI>Plymouth</HI> about this Time tho&s;e called <HI>Quakers</HI> were generally kept out of their Meeting-hou&s;e; and then performing their Wor&s;hip in the open Street, as a Duty they owed to God, and for the Omi&s;&s;ion of which they judged no Man could be di&s;pen&s;ed with, they &s;uffered exceedingly, not only in Winter by the Sharpne&s;s of the Wea|ther,

<P>Per&s;ecution was now very hot in many Places.

<P>How can it po&s;ibly be, that your Common People &s;hould believe tho&s;e Things which Chri&s;t, the Prophets and Apo&s;tles have &s;poken, unle&s;s it be granted them to read or recite the &s;ame in their own Tongue, to the End they might both hear and under&s;tand them by the Spirit which gave them forth?

<P>Come ye forth therefore publickly, and make Tryal; that it may appear at length to all Chri&s;tendom, whether yours he the Divine and Immortal Chri&s;t and God, or no.

<P N="7">7. Further, where did Chri&s;t or his Apo&s;tles ever &s;peak to the Saints, of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> where|in Men &s;hould he purged from their Sins after Death? Shew us where it it written in the <HI>New-Te&s;tament.</HI> Is it not therefore a plain denying, that Chri&s;t Blood purgeth from all Sin, to tell the People a <HI>Fable</HI> of a certain <HI>Purgatory</HI> to purge them from <HI>Sins after Death?</HI> Is it not likewi&s;e a Denying of Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m with the Holy Spirit, and of Spiritnal Cir|cumci&s;ion, and Faith in Chri&s;t, which, purgeth in this Life, and giveth the Victory?</P>
<P>Did not Chri&s;t an&s;wer &s;ome that de&s;ired Fire might come down from Heaven and con+&s;ume tho&s;e that would not receive him; <HI>Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of?</HI> Did not he rebuke them, &s;aying that he <HI>came not to de&s;troy Mens Lives, but to &s;ave them?</HI> Luke ix 54, 55, 56.</P>
<P>Ye therefore who have de&s;troyed &s;uch a va&s;t Number of Men and Women for their Di&s;&s;enting from you about <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> and taken away their Lives by &s;uch kind of In&s;truments, Racks and Fires, as were never sent down from Heaven, but devi&s;ed and invented by your &s;elves; Are ye not wor&s;e than they, who de&s;ired Fire to he called from Heaven to de&s;troy Mens Lives? And &s;eeing Chri&s;t told them, that they knew not what manner of Spirit they were of, do ye know what manner of Spirit ye are of, who have devi&s;ed &s;o many Ways and Torments for the killing of Men, and havc actually made u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>With what Front ran ye per&s;uade us to commit our Souls Bodies, and Lives to you, who know not of what Spirit ye are Children, neither have the Mind of Chri&s;t, who &s;aid, He came not to de&s;troy Mens Lives, but to &s;ave them</P>
<P>Are ye not all, therefore, as many as take away Mem Lives for Wor&s;hip devi&s;ed by you, obnoxious to the Rebuke of Chri&s;t? For when did Chri&s;t or any of his Apo&s;tles ever give Command, or by their Example teach, that any one that was di&s;obedient to them, or re|jected their Doctrine and Rellgion, &s;hould be per&s;ecuted and impri&s;oned, or puni&s;hed by any Carnal Weapons? Tell as where any thing of this Kind is contained, either in the four Evangelical Hi&s;tories, or in the Epi&s;tles written to the Chri&s;tian Churches?</P>
<P>Did ever Chri&s;t or his Apo&s;tles go to the Rope-makers to buy Whips and Halters, to whip and hang Men for di&s;&s;enting from them, as ye have done? Did they ever go to the Black&s;miths to make Chains, Fetters, Bolts and Locks? Or to the Gun&s;miths to buy Guns and Musket? or to the Sword-cutlers, to buy Swords or Halberts? Did they ever build Pri&s;ons, or get Holes and Vaults dug, to &s;orce Men by &s;uch Means to their Religion? Shew us an Example and Precept given by Chri&s;t or his Apo&s;tles, which commands and makes the U&s;e of &s;uch Weapons and In&s;truments lawful.</P>
<P>But if ye cannot make Proof thereof, it is nece&s;&s;ary for you to confe&s;s and acknowledge, that ye are fallen and degenerated from the true Chri&s;tian Weapons, which the Apo&s;tles and Primitive Chri&s;tians u&s;ed, &s;aying, <HI>The Weapons of our Warfare not Carnal, but mighty thro' God,</HI> that it.

<P>Whil&s;t Per&s;ecution was on foot in <HI>England,</HI> there was &s;ome Divi&s;ion among tho&s;e called <HI>Quakers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of <HI>Wilkin&s;on &amp; Story</HI>'s Sepa|ration, the pre|tended Occa&s;ion, and of whom it chiefly con&s;i&s;ted.</NOTE> which had its Ri&s;e &s;ome Years before.

And becau&s;e in the Beginning there were no &s;uch Meetings, or Di&s;cipline, and yet they had lived in mutual Peace and Unity, it was a&s;&s;erted, <Q>That &s;uch Meetings were needle&s;s, and that every one ought to be guided by the Spirit of God in his own Mind, and not to be governed by Rules of Man.</Q> By which it appeared that they were again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;h|ing any Order of Government in the Church. But they were greatly bent again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Women's Meetings, who as Deacone&s;&s;es met together at &s;et Times, to provide for poor Families, and &s;ick People that were in want. It is true, it was objected that in tho&s;e Meetings &s;ometimes was debated what was not &s;o convenient in every re&s;pect, becau&s;e young Women were admitted there al&s;o, to &s;ee and learn how Matters were treated by the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave and ancient Women: And what if &s;ome had been a little too forward to meddle with Affairs properly belonging to the Men? the creepi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g in of a wrong U&s;e can by no Means ju&s;tify the abrogating what is really <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eful; and that hone&s;t and ancient Women took Care for the poor and indigent Members of the Church was indeed laudable.

To this it was an|&s;wered, That if it plea&s;ed God to call to his Mini&s;try Per&s;ons of mean E&s;tate, the Church was not warranted to hinder it, and let &s;uch &s;uffer Want; &s;ince he, as Sovereign of the Univer&s;e, could not be limited in the Di&s;tribution of his Gifts. <HI>Rogers</HI> would continually appeal to the primitive Times, and to give &s;ome Colour to what they a&s;&s;erted, he and his Adherents publi&s;hed a Paper, with <HI>Edward Burroughs</HI>'s Name to it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And father on <HI>E Burroughs</HI> what <HI>G.

<P>O King, we do farther declare, that God Almighty hath taught and en|gaged us to acknowledge, and actually obey Magi&s;tracy (as his Ordinance)

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To the Lords Burgherma&s;ters, Coun&s;ellors and Rulers of the City of <HI>EMBDEN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe&s;e are to acquaint you with due Re&s;pect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Friends in <HI>Holland</HI> made this return to them.</NOTE> that a Scheme or Plan of yours, dated the 16-26 <HI>February,</HI> 1686, is come to our Hands, which having been peru&s;ed by us, we have thought it convenient in the Fear of the Lord, to &s;end you the following An&s;wer.
Fir&s;t, we thank God Almighty for the Ea&s;e and Liberty which our Friends at pre&s;ent enjoy under your Government, and are like to en|joy in the future. And, Secondly, We cannot but acknowledge very acceptably your Clemency and Meekne&s;s, which ye &s;hew by taking Notice of the State of a de&s;pi&s;ed and oppre&s;&s;ed People, who becau&s;e of their Way and Wor&s;hip, differing from the many Ways in the World, are gain&s;ayed every where. And therefore it is that we are the more &s;tirr'd up in our Minds to pray &s;ervently to the Lord God for your Peace and Pro&s;perity, and the Continuance of your good Re|&s;olution; that &s;o all tho&s;e who &s;erve the Lord in Uprightne&s;s of Heart may lead a peaceable and godly Life among you, by &s;hewing forth the Fruits of true Chri&s;tianity in Truth, Sincerity, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Now as to what ye have been plea&s;ed to declare, that ye were willing to confirm the afore&s;aid your good Re&s;olution by a publick Act, we
<PB N="572" REF="003104_0583_0FEFF8CDB66D9FD0">
let you know, that we are &s;o well &s;atisfied with your Word and Oral Declaration concerning the afore-mentioned Thing, that this is more to us than any thing we could further de&s;ire, as knowing that good Men think them&s;elves bound by their good Words to perform what is good. And &s;ince ye are &s;en&s;ible on what Ground ye came to the a|fore&s;aid Re&s;olution, and declared your&s;elves thus, we doubt not but the &s;ame Per&s;ua&s;ion and Rea&s;on continuing with you, will prove a more &s;trong Engagement to you to perform the &s;ame, than any out|ward Seal can be. And in that Engagement we are willing to acqui|e&s;ce, and &s;hould not have mentioned any other, unle&s;s &s;ome among you, as we have been informed, fir&s;t had made mention thereof. And as to what ye demand of us, we declare in the Nakedne&s;s and Sim|plicity of our Hearts, that in Regard of our Temporal Conver&s;ation and Deportment, we de&s;ire no further Protection, than when we deal righteou&s;ly to all, and walk according to that Golden Rule, That we do unto all Men, what we de&s;ire &s;hould be done to us. And concern|ing our Religion and Wor&s;hip, which we believe we owe to Almighty God, it is thus: That &s;ince it differs from other Per&s;ua&s;ions, it makes us obnoxious not only to the Mockings and Revilings of ignorant People, but expo&s;eth us al&s;o to the Malice and Envy of many, who hate us without a ju&s;t Cau&s;e; and therefore it is that we &s;tand in need of your favourable Interpretation, and your be&s;t Con&s;truction of what we do, and what we leave undone. And if we &s;hould err in tho&s;e Matters, we &s;hall be the greate&s;t Lo&s;ers by it; and if Truth be on our Side, then our Adver&s;aries &s;hall not be able to prevail; for Truth is the &s;tronge&s;t, and it is not good for any to fight again&s;t it. How&s;oever then it may be with us in this Matter, yet we hope that ye will be plea&s;ed, if we behave our &s;elves peaceable and hone&s;t to|wards you and all Men, to let us be Partakers with our peaceable Neighbours of your general Protection. And tho' ye might plea&s;e to give us a publick Act of your afore&s;aid Re&s;olution, yet we clearly fore&s;ee, that it would be hardly po&s;&s;ible to u&s;e &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions, that our Enemies, by &s;ome wre&s;ting or other of the Words, or a wrong Interpretation of the Expre&s;&s;ions contained therein, &s;hould not be able to make us &s;teemed guilty of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and &s;o find Matter a|gain&s;t us. And therefore we think it very &s;afe to rely on your Word, and good Re&s;olution, in which it hath plea&s;ed you to declare, that we &s;hall enjoy Liberty to live and trade in your City, provided we pay Cu&s;tom and Taxes which other Citizens are &s;ubject to; and that then we &s;hall be at Liberty to meet together to wor&s;hip God in &s;uch a Way as he hath convinced us we ought to do, and to call upon him, and to exhort one another to Love and good Works, and a Chri&s;tian Conver&s;ation. And on your Behalf it will tend to the Prai&s;e of the Magi&s;trates, that ye favour us in this. And it will al&s;o be to the promoting of God's Glory; and will oblige us to pray for you, that the Lord God may be plea&s;ed to pre&s;erve you, and to make you con|tinue in &s;uch a good, whole&s;ome, and well-grounded Re&s;olution. We are and re&s;t,</P>

<P>Hereby we &s;ee how God hath the Hearts of all Men in his Hands, and that he turneth them whither&s;oever he will: For the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Embden</HI> had &s;ome Years before, from a blind Zeal, kindled by tho&s;e who ought to have &s;topt it, given forth very &s;evere Edicts again&s;t the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and per&s;ecuted them fiercely; but now they allowed them an entire Liberty.</P>

But many others wno had been in Cu&s;tody &s;everal Years, appeared now at <HI>London,</HI> in the Annual Meeting of their Friends, to the great Joy of their Brethren: And when &s;ome of the&s;e went to thank the King for his Favour, they were kindly admitted; and there|by he drew their Inclination towards him: For his Endeavours were now, as he &s;aid, to bring about a compleat Liberty of Con&s;cience. What his Aim was, I am not to inve&s;tigate, for he never attained to it. In the mean while he made Per&s;ecution generally to cea&s;e, not only in <HI>England,</HI> but al&s;o in other Places of his Dominions: For having heard that the <HI>Quakers</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> were very much mole&s;ted, becau&s;e for Con&s;cience-&s;ake they could not bear Arms, he order'd &s;ome of the Members of his Council to write the following Letter.</P>

<P>In this Year <HI>David Barclay</HI> died at <HI>Ury</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pious End of <HI>D.

I may not omit to mention &s;ome Particulars. In the latter End of <HI>September,</HI> being pa&s;t the 76th Year of his Age, he was taken with a Fever, which con|tinued two Weeks; and being much troubled with the Gravel, his Sick|ne&s;s was accompanied with Pain in making Water.

<P>About this Time, <HI>G.

<P><Q>CHri&s;t Je&s;us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

Chri&s;t did not teach them to pray to the Dead, nor for the Dead. Neither did Chri&s;t or his Apo&s;tles teach the Believers to pray by Beads, nor to &s;ing by outward Organs: But the Apo&s;tle &s;aid, he would <HI>&s;ing and pray in Spirit:</HI> For the Spirit it &s;elf <HI>maketh Interce&s;&s;ion; and the Lord, that &s;earcheth the Hearty know|eth the Mind of the Spirit.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To take Coun&s;el of the Dead, was forbidden by the Law of God; but they were to take Coun&s;el of the Lord; And he hath given Chri&s;t in the New Covenant, in his Go&s;pel-day, to be a Coun&s;ellor and a Lead|er, to all his Believers in his Light.

<P>WE cannot but ble&s;s and prai&s;e the Name of Almighty God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Addre&s;s</NOTE> who hath the Hearts of Princes in his Hand, that he hath in|clined the King to hear the Cries of his &s;uffering Subjects for Con|&s;cience-&s;ake; and we rejoice, that in&s;tead of troubling him with Com|plaints of our Sufferings, he hath given us &s;o eminent an Occa&s;ion to pre&s;ent him with our Thanks. And &s;ince it hath plea&s;ed the King out of his great Compa&s;&s;ion, thus to commi&s;erate our afflicted Con|dition, which hath &s;o particularly appeared by his gracious Procla|mation and Warrants la&s;t Year, (whereby above twelve hundred Pri|&s;oners were relea&s;ed from their &s;evere Impri&s;onments, and many others from Spoil and Ruin in their E&s;tates and Properties) and his Princely Speech in Council, and chri&s;tian Declaration for Liberty of Con&s;cience, in which he doth not only expre&s;s his Aver&s;ion to all Force upon Con|&s;cience, and grant all his di&s;&s;enting Subjects an ample Liberty to wor|&s;hip God in the Way they are per&s;uaded is mo&s;t agreeable to his Will, but gives them his Kingly Word, the &s;ame &s;hall continue du|ring his Reign; we do (as our Friends of this City have already done) render the King our humble, chri&s;tian, and thankful Acknowledg|ments, not only in Behalf of our &s;elves, but with Re&s;pect to our Friends throughout <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales;</HI> and pray God with all our Hearts to ble&s;s and pre&s;erve thee, O King, and tho&s;e under thee in &s;o good a Work: And as we can a&s;&s;ure the King it is well accepted in the Counties from whence we came, &s;o we hope the good Effects thereof for the Peace, Trade, and Pro&s;perity of the Kingdom will pro|duce &s;uch a Concurrence from the Parliament, as may &s;ecure it to our Po&s;terity in after Times, and while we live, it &s;hall be our Endeavour (thro' God's Grace) to demean our &s;elves, as in Con&s;cience to God, and Duty to the King, we are obliged,</P>

<P>Here we &s;ee what the King declared to be his Intention: But per|haps that Prince did not con&s;ider, that if &s;uch a general Liberty had been procured, he &s;hould not have been able to make it continue longer than the Popi&s;h Clergy would have thought it convenient. For who is ignorant what an unlimited Power the Roman Prelates have u&s;urped,
<PB N="582" REF="003104_0593_0FEFF8DB47FD8C28">
not only in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, but al&s;o in the Political Part? In&s;omuch, that tho' the King's Intention might have been really &s;incere, yet it's like it would have been thwarted, tho' he might have been willing that it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e. That his Meaning was &s;incere, &s;everal I know, that were not of his Per&s;ua&s;ion, have believed; and among the&s;e there were &s;uch, who thought that Liberty of Con&s;cience might have been &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed, that it &s;hould not have been in the Power of the Papi&s;ts to break it. But Time hath &s;hewn, that King <HI>James</HI> was not to be the In&s;trument for Settling &s;uch a Liberty of Con&s;cience, and that the Repealing of the penal Laws was re&s;erved for another Prince. Yet the King was by &s;ome thought to do what he could to &s;top rapacious Per&s;ecutors, and to re&s;train their Power, with Re&s;pect to impo&s;ing of Oaths. It is true, it was &s;aid that the King might not do &s;o; for by granting this Liberty to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> he opened a Door for the <HI>Ro|mani&s;ts</HI> to bear Offices, without taking the required Oaths. Now that he di&s;charged the <HI>Quakers</HI> from the&s;e Oaths, may appear by the fol|lowing Order to the Lord Mayor of <HI>London;</HI></P>

By &s;uch Means &s;ome got their Goods again, that had been taken from them upon the Account of religious Wor&s;hip; for in many Places they lay long un&s;old, becau&s;e few would buy Goods &s;o taken. And that the King by the&s;e his Favours drew the Love and Affection of many of his Subjects towards him&s;elf, none need to wonder; for what|ever his Religion was, he delivered them from that grievous Burden, under which they had been oppre&s;&s;ed &s;o many Years. To this may be added, that he u&s;ed them kindly in all Re&s;pects, and would not &s;uffer his Servants to mole&s;t any for not pulling off their Hats, when they came near his Royal Per&s;on; Nay, &s;o far went this Conde&s;cen&s;ion, that a certain Country-man of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Per&s;ua&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King &s;uf|fers <HI>Quakers</HI> to appear cover|ed in his Pre|&s;ence.</NOTE> coming to him with his Hat on his Head, the King took off his own Hat, and held it under his Arm; which the other &s;eeing, &s;aid, <HI>The King needs not keep off his Hat for me.</HI> To which that Prince returned, <HI>You don't know the Cu&s;tom here, for that requires, that but one Hat mu&s;t be on here.</HI> I have been told of more &s;uch like Occurrences, which I pa&s;s by; but it appears from thence, that the King endeavoured to have among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> the Repute of a mild and courteous Prince.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grants free Liberty of Con|&s;cience al&s;o in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> And this Year he gave in <HI>Scotland</HI> al&s;o full Liberty of Con&s;cience, and freed tho&s;e that were &s;till under Sufferings, granting them the free Liberty of their religious Meet|ings. The &s;aid Liberty he al&s;o allowed to the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> provided they should not meet in the Fields, or in Sheds, as &s;ome did.</P>
<P>The King having thus granted Liberty of Con&s;cience to People of all Per&s;ua&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And endeavours to introduce Po|pery, permitting the Je&s;uits a College in the <HI>Savoy,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> did whatever he could to introduce Popery in <HI>England;</HI> for he permitted the Je&s;uits to erect a College in the <HI>Savoy</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> and &s;uffered the Fryars to go publickly in the Dre&s;s of their Mona&s;|tical Orders. This was a very &s;trange Sight to Prote&s;tants in <HI>England,</HI> and it cau&s;ed no &s;mall Fermentation in the Minds of People, when the Fellows of <HI>Magdalen</HI> College at <HI>Oxford</HI> were by the King's Order di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W.

<P>The King's <HI>Declaration for Liberty of Con&s;cience,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Declara|tion ordered to be read in Chur|ches and Chap|pels.</NOTE> was, on the 27th of the Month called <HI>April,</HI> publi&s;hed again, <HI>To &s;hew that he was firm and con&s;tant in his Re&s;olution, and that his Intentions were not changed &s;ince he i&s;&s;ued it out, to excite his Subjects to join in it, and to chu&s;e &s;uch Members of Parliament, as might do their Part to fini&s;h what he had begun.</HI> Hereto was annexed an Order of the Council, for <HI>Reading this Declaration in all Churches and Chappels throughout the Kingdom;</HI> and ordering the Bi&s;hops, <HI>to &s;end and di&s;tribute the Declaration through|out their &s;everal Dioce&s;es to be read accordingly.</HI> But they refu&s;ed to do &s;o, pretending it was not legal, (tho' &s;ome there were who thought it was,) becau&s;e they were again&s;t Liberty of Con&s;cience.

<P>Now &s;ince it has plea&s;ed thee, O King, to renew to all thy Sub|jects, by thy la&s;t Declaration, thy gracious A&s;&s;urances to pur&s;ue the E&s;tabli&s;hment of this Chri&s;tian Liberty and Property upon an unalter|able Foundation; and in Order to it, to hold a Parliament in <HI>Novem|ber</HI> next at farthe&s;t:</P>

<P>This Addre&s;s being pre&s;ented to the King was well received. Some have been ready to think, that the latter Part of this Addre&s;s con|cerned the Office of Magi&s;trates, which not without Rea&s;on 'tis be|lieved that a Chri&s;tian might &s;erve, with no more Di&s;paragement to an inoffen&s;ive Life, than 'tis incon&s;i&s;tent for a pious Father to give due Correction to his rebellious Child: For tho' our Saviour charges <HI>not to re|&s;i&s;t Evil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. v. 39, 44</NOTE> but <HI>to love Enemies;</HI> and that he reproving <HI>Peter,</HI> who from a forward Zeal cut off the High Prie&s;t's Servant's Ear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John xviii. 11</NOTE> &s;aid to him, <HI>Put up thy Sword into the Sheath:</HI> And that al&s;o the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> di&s;ap|proves War and Fighting, yet we find in &s;acred Writ, that the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> calls the Magi&s;trate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> <HI>the Mini&s;ter of God,</HI> and <HI>a Revenger to exe|cute

<P>But to return to my Relation, and to take up again the Thread of this Hi&s;tory, from which I have been diverted a little by this Digre&s;|&s;ion; I know there were &s;ome in tho&s;e Days, who thought that if People of all Per&s;ua&s;ions in <HI>England</HI> had a Share in the Government, proportionable to their Number, a Means might have been found out, to hinder any Party, e&s;pecially the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> from exalting them&s;elves a|bove the others. But to me it &s;eems not improbable, that if this had Effect, and a higher Hand had not cut off the Way thereto, it would have appeared that tho&s;e Men did not reckon well. But it never came to this Pa&s;s, for the King's Power was tottering already, tho' he en|deavoured to &s;upport it, even with good Means; for to be helpful to his Subjects, who, tho' free-born Men, were deprived of their Freedom, meerly becau&s;e for Con&s;cience-&s;ake they could not &s;wear, and to help them to this Right to which they were entitled as well as others, could not be judged undue Means, unle&s;s under it had been hidden an Intent to introduce this Liberty al&s;o in Favour of the Papi&s;ts, tho' they did not believe Swearing unlawful.</P>

<P>'Twas now &s;aid commonly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The&s;e Favours are ill repre&s;en|ted, but other Affairs here mention'd were the Cau&s;e of ge|neral Di&s;content.</NOTE> that the King might not do thus; and tho&s;e who grudged the <HI>Quakers</HI> this Liberty, did not &s;tick to &s;et forth this Di&s;pen&s;ation in very ill-favoured Colours; nay they &s;aid that <HI>William Penn</HI> advi&s;ed the King to do, what he could not do without breaking his Promi&s;e. But if the King had made no greater Infringement, his Reign it may be would have la&s;ted longer: But the Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing of the Fellows of <HI>Magdalen College</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> the Impri&s;onment of the Bi&s;hops, and the publick Admittance of Je&s;uits and Monks, cau&s;ed a Ferment in the Minds of People. Now the Bi&s;hops were tried at the King's-bench-bar, in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall;</HI> but they were acquitted, and &s;o relea&s;ed. The King
<PB N="587" REF="003104_0598_0FEFF8A06B9161A0">al&s;o had appointed &s;ome Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Commi&s;&s;ioners; but many look'd upon this as a kind of Inqui&s;ition, and it &s;eemed not well to agree with Liberty of Con&s;cience, which if he had maintained ju&s;tly, according to the Advice of the <HI>Quakers</HI> in their Addre&s;s, it is not likely that he would have come to &s;uch a Strait, as now he was put to.</P>
<P>Not long before this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T.

Among other Ca&s;es &s;he relates al&s;o, how &s;ome Time before her Impri&s;onment it happened, that by Order of the Ju&s;tices <HI>Thomas Cutler,</HI> and <HI>James George,</HI> &s;he being &s;eized in the Street, &s;aid to the Latter, That the Lord would plead her Cau&s;e, and that what Mea&s;ure he meted, &s;hould be mea&s;ured to him again. And it thus happened, that before &s;he was relea&s;ed, the Wife of the &s;aid <HI>George,</HI> who took her from her Husband, was by Death taken from him. After|wards this <HI>George</HI> came with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> into a Meeting, where <HI>Theophila</HI> was on her Knees praying: At which the Bi&s;hop asking him, Whether &s;he was the Woman he &s;poke of, and he an&s;wering, <HI>Yes, my Lord;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Violence of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Glo+ce&s;ter</HI></NOTE> the Bi&s;hop took her by the Arm with &s;uch Violence, that he had almo&s;t pulled her down backward, &s;aying, <HI>Give over, Woman, and obey the King's Officers.</HI> But &s;uch was her Zeal that it could not be &s;top'd; for the more Oppo&s;ition &s;he met with, the more &s;he felt her&s;elf encou|raged, and in&s;pired, to prai&s;e God for his Goodne&s;s; And tho' the Bi&s;hop &s;tirred up the Ju&s;tice, yet it &s;eemed not in his Power to break off the Current of her Speech; &s;o that they let her alone, till &s;he ha|ving di&s;charged her&s;elf, &s;tood up. Then the Names of tho&s;e that were met, were taken in Writing; and &s;ome Time after, &s;he, tho' aged and weakly, was in Winter-&s;ea&s;on led three or four Miles thro' the Snow, and committed to Jail at <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> where &s;he was kept three Years and four Months, and then relea&s;ed by King <HI>James.</HI> Afterward &s;he publi&s;hed a Book, as hath been &s;aid already, in which &s;he gave an Account how &s;ome of her Friends had been beaten, punch'd, and abu&s;ed to that Degree, that they died of it, as &s;he te&s;tified to have &s;een her|&s;elf: <Q>Yet, &s;aid &s;he, tho' many died who were &s;tronger than I, it hath plea&s;ed the Lord to pre&s;erve my Life, that I may &s;peak to the Prai&s;e of his Name, and tell of his Wonders, and put you, Per&s;ecutors, once more in Mind what belongs to your Peace.

<P>I am come now almo&s;t to a Conclu&s;ion of my Relation concerning Per&s;ecution; of which I could have written much more, but that I was unwilling to extend my Work beyond what I &s;hould have been well able to compleat. Yet before I altogether part with this Matter, I will mention &s;omething concerning <HI>Theophilus Green,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sufferings of <HI>T. Green,</HI> &amp; notable Deliver|ances from the Malice of his Enemies.</NOTE> of whom mention hath been made before. He liv'd at <HI>Battor&s;ea,</HI> not far from <HI>London,</HI> and was a Man beloved of his Neighbours, becau&s;e of his hone&s;t Conver|&s;ation; yet he was much per&s;ecuted, both for attending Meetings, and for Preaching. Once it happened that &s;ome Officers came to his Hou&s;e to &s;ee whether there was a Meeting, and they behaved them&s;elves mo|derately: For what they did &s;eemed again&s;t their Mind, it being only in Obedience to the Order of Ju&s;tice <HI>Duke,</HI> who on Account of a former Offence, had i&s;&s;ued out Warrants to make Di&s;tre&s;s. The Officers not &s;atisfied in the Ca&s;e, and &s;eeing no Meeting, went their Way, and re|turned the Warrant; and <HI>T. Green</HI> went afterwards to the &s;aid Ju&s;tice, and &s;peaking to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His plain Dealing with Ju&s;tice <HI>Duke,</HI> and the Effe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE> &s;aid among&s;t the re&s;t. <HI>Con&s;ider what that Mouth and Tongue of thine hath &s;aid formerly,</HI> viz. <HI>That I had been very kind to thee, and is this the Way of requiting it? Know for certain, That that God whom I have &s;erved, and for who&s;e Cau&s;e I now &s;uffer, will avenge me; for Vengeance is the Lord's and he will repay it, one Way or other, except thou &s;peedily repente&s;t.</HI> At this Saying the Ju&s;tice began to trem|ble,
<PB N="589" REF="003104_0600_0FEFF924E00D8D18">and crying out, &s;aid, <HI>I will do you no more Hurt than I will do my own Soul. Pray go to the Officers, and tell them, I will never trouble them any more upon the Account of you. Green</HI> did &s;o, and they were glad of it. And <HI>Duke</HI> being upon &s;ome Complaint di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, one Sir <HI>John Broadrick</HI> &s;ucceeded in his Room; and he was &s;o moderate, that he prevented the Informers, by keeping <HI>Theophilus</HI> and his Friends o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of their Meeting-hou&s;e, which was for about two Years and a half. Afterwards they were &s;uffered again to go into their Meeting-hou&s;e, but then Ju&s;tice <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> came once, and taking their Names, fined <HI>The|ophilus</HI> 10<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> as a Preacher. And afterwards he with others coming with a Con&s;table to &s;eize for the Fine, the Con&s;table being come to the Door of the Hou&s;e &s;aid, <HI>Neighbour</HI> Green, <HI>where are you? we are c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me to &s;eize your Goods, if you will let us in.</HI> But this &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed the Ju|&s;tice, that going down the Yard, and &s;eeing &s;ome Oa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s and Poles, he required the Con&s;table to take them away. To which he an&s;wered, <HI>I am no Porter.</HI> Then &s;aid the Ju&s;tice, <HI>Command &s;ome others to do it.</HI> To which the Con&s;table returned, <HI>I command you to do it.</HI> This &s;o enrag'd the Ju&s;tice, that he fined him. Sometime after, the &s;aid Ju&s;tice com|ing again with an High Con&s;table, and another, a petty Con&s;table, &s;eized a Barge, and had it carried away, and &s;everal Times offered it to Sale, but none would buy it. And after it had been carried about from Place to Place for Sale, at length it was found adrift, by one who knew not of its being &s;eized; and hearing that it was <HI>Theophilus</HI>'s Barge, he brought it to him. But <HI>Theophilus</HI> went to the Con&s;tables, and told them how it came to him, and where he had it, &s;aying, <HI>Since it was come to him again, he was willing to keep it; but if they took it away a|gain, he would not hinder them.</HI> This Account being given to the Ju|&s;tice, he &s;ent a Warrant, and committed <HI>Theophilus</HI> to the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ea</HI> Pri&s;on. After three Weeks the Se&s;&s;ions was held at the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ea,</HI> and the la&s;t Day the &s;aid Ju&s;tice came to him in the Pri&s;on, &s;aying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Severity and Hypocri&s;y of Ju&s;tice <HI>For+&s;ter.</HI></NOTE> <HI>He came out of Love to &s;ee him, and to advi&s;e him for his Good;</HI> which was, <HI>that he would Love him pay his Fine:</HI> For, &s;aid he, <HI>I am &s;ure the Grand Jury hath found the Bill again&s;t you; and if you &s;hould come off, I have &s;uch an Influence with the Judge, as to cau&s;e the Oath to be tender'd to you; and I know you will not take it; and then you will be run to a</HI> Premunire, <HI>and are not like to come out as long as you live.</HI> To which <HI>Theophilus</HI> an&s;wered, <HI>Thou &s;aid&s;t thy coming was in Love, to advi&s;e me for my Good; but by what thou ha&s;t &s;aid, it appears the contrary: For now I perceive thou ha&s;t de|vi&s;ed as much Mi&s;chief as thou can&s;t again&s;t me. As to the Fine, if it were but ten Pence, nay, ten Farthings, I would not pay it. And if the Lord &s;hould permit thee to do as thou ha&s;t &s;aid, and &s;o be the Cau&s;e of bringing my grey Hairs the &s;ooner to the Grave, my Blood will be at Ju&s;tice</HI> For|&s;ter's <HI>Door, and it will cry Vengeance again&s;t thee.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day the two Con&s;tables being called before the Grand Ju|ry, were asked, <HI>What they had again&s;t</HI> Theophilus Green, <HI>that &s;tood there indicted:</HI> And the High Con&s;table an&s;wered, <HI>As to</HI> Theophilus Green, <HI>he is as hone&s;t a Man, tho' a</HI> Quaker, <HI>as lives about us; and he was lately in Office for the Poor, and behaved him&s;elf as well in it as any hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the&s;e twenty Years. And touching the Barge he is indicted for, when it came to him, he came to us, and told how it came, and where he had laid it, &s;aying, if we would take it away again, he would not hinder us. This is all we have to &s;ay.</HI> Some of the Grand Jury knowing <HI>Theophilus</HI> very well, and the Cau&s;e too, did aggravate the Matter very high a|gain&s;t the Ju&s;tice: And as to the Indictment, they brought it in <HI>Ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o|ramus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Theophilus</HI> cleared, and tho advi&s;ed by Sir <HI>R.

<P>Before I conclude this Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W.

Penn,</HI> who, when the Government of King <HI>James</HI> was &s;inking, not only bore the Blame of many Mi&s;carriages, but by &s;ome was &s;tiled a Papi&s;t, tho' this was altogether fal&s;e. But he had a great many Ene|mies; and it was no new Thing to brand the <HI>Quakers</HI> with the odious Name of Je&s;uits: For thirty Years before this Time at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> great Endeavours were u&s;ed to per&s;uade People they were Franci&s;cans. <HI>W. Penn</HI> patiently bore the Slander of being decried as a Papi&s;t, &s;aying but little in Ju&s;tification of him&s;elf, till at length he made a Return to a Letter &s;ent by one who &s;eriou&s;ly begg'd of him to give an An&s;wer to tho&s;e Accu&s;ations that had been forged in Prejudice of his Reputation. In this Paper, <Q>He a&s;cribed his free Acce&s;s to the King, partly to the Relation his Father, as Admiral, had to the Service of the &s;aid King, who was then Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and High Admiral of <HI>England;</HI> and his &s;pecial Favour al&s;o in relea&s;ing him out of the Tower of <HI>London</HI> in the Year 1669.</Q> To this he added, <HI>My Father's humble Reque&s;t to him upon his Death-bed was, to protect me from the Inconveniences and Trou|bles my Per&s;ua&s;ion might expo&s;e me unto; and his friendly Promi&s;e to do it, and exact Performance of it, from the Moment I addre&s;s'd my &s;elf to him: I &s;ay, when all this is con&s;idered, any Body that hath the lea&s;t Pretence to Good-nature, Gratitude, or Genero&s;ity, mu&s;t needs know how to interpret my Acce&s;s to the King.&mdash;Is any thing more fooli&s;h as well as fal&s;e, than that becau&s;e I am often at</HI> Whitehall, <HI>therefore I mu&s;t be Author of all that is done there, that doth not plea&s;e abroad. But &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome &s;uch Things to have been done; pray tell me if I am bound to oppo&s;e any Thing I am not called to do? I never was a Member of Council, Cabinet, or Committee, where the Affairs of the Kingdom are tran&s;acted. I have had no Office or Tru&s;t, and con&s;equently nothing can be &s;aid to be done by me; nor, for that Rea&s;on, could I lie under any Te&s;t or any Obligation to di&s;cover my Opinion of publick Acts of State: And therefore, neither can any &s;uch Acts, nor any Silence about them, in Ju&s;tice be made my Crime. Volunteers are Blanks and Cyphers in all Governments. And unle&s;s calling at</HI> Whitehall <HI>once a Day, upon many Occa&s;ions, or my not being turned out of nothing, (for that no Office is) be the Evidence of my Compliance in di&s;agreeable Things, I know not what el&s;e can with any Truth be alledged again&s;t me. &mdash; I am not without Apprehen&s;ions of the Cau&s;e of this Behaviour towards me; I mean my con&s;tant Zeal for an impartial Liberty of Con&s;cience. But if that be it, the Cau&s;e is too good to be in Pain about it. I ever under&s;tood that to be the natural Right of all Men; and that he that had a Religion with|out it, his Religion was one of his own Make. For what is not the Religion of a Man's Choice, is the Religion of him that impo&s;es it: So that Liberty of Con&s;cience is the fir&s;t Step to have a Religion. This is no new Opinion with me, I have writ many Apologies within the la&s;t Twenty Years to defend it, and that impartially. Yet I have as con&s;tantly declared that Bounds ought to be &s;et to this Freedom, and that Morality was the be&s;t; and that as often as that was violated under a Pretence of Con&s;cience, it was fit the Civil Power &s;hould take Place. Nor did I ever once think of promoting any Sort of Liberty of Con&s;cience for any body, which did not pre&s;erve the common Prote&s;t|ancy of the Kingdom, and the ancient Rights of the Government: For to &s;ay Truth, the one cannot be maintained without the other.&mdash; And till I &s;aw my

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>Except ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e regenerated and born again, ye cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>THis is the Word of the Lord God to all People this Day; this lies not in any Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and in vain Imagination, and what&s;oever el&s;e it is that you d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">k your &s;elves withal; you mu&s;t every particular Man and Woman be born again, el&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. This was the Doctrine of Chri&s;t in that prepared Body wherein he appeared in the World, and preached to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> that &s;tanding Doctrine to this Moment of Time, and will be &s;o while any Man breath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon the Earth; there is no other Way, no other Gate to enter into Life, but by this great Work of <HI>Regeneration.</HI> Now to enforce People to come to this great Work, and to &s;ee forward from Earth to Heaven, all being driven out of Paradice by the Cherubim &s;et with a flaming Sword, there is no returning to that ble&s;&s;ed Life, but by the Lo&s;s of that Life that did grieve the Spirit of God, and which did cau&s;e Man to be driven out; there is no other Way of return again but by this new Birth. As you are all driven and forced out of Paradice, and the flaming Sword and the Cherubims are &s;et to keep the Way of the Tree of Life, &s;o you mu&s;t return into the Favour of God again, by the Light of Chri&s;t, and you have Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept, here a little, and there a little, to direct your Minds to the Light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. As the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> was made a living Soul, &s;o the &s;econd <HI>Adam</HI> is a quickning Spirit. This know for certain, no Man or Woman can be quickned, and rai&s;ed up into the Life of the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> till the Life of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> be taken away from them.</P>
<P>So now, let every one of you deal plainly with your own Hearts, how you came to be a &s;lain People to the Life of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> in which Life there was a Working of the My&s;tery of Iniquity in every Part of Man. One cries, Lo here is Chri&s;t, another, Lo there is Chri&s;t, and every one is following his own Imagination about the Letter of the Scripture; this is &s;till but the vain Spirit of Man, running and &s;triving to recover him|&s;elf; and this is the Cau&s;e there is &s;o much Profe&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> God, and &s;o little of his Nature appearing among the Sons and Daughters of Men. Now all of you that come to be Regenerated, you mu&s;t come to the Light of Chri&s;t, there is no other Way to it. He will &s;earch your Hearts, and try your Reins, and &s;et your Sins in Order before you, and trace out the Iniquities that compa&s;s you about; therefore you mu&s;t &s;ee your &s;elves a lo&s;t People, a &s;inful People, and &s;o come to feel the Weight of your Sins upon your Con&s;ciences, there is no other Way to come to Life; you will never complain of Sin till you be burthened with it, till you have a Trumpet &s;ounding in your Ears, to awaken you, that you may ari&s;e from the Dead, that Chri&s;t may give you Light; there is no other Way, dear People, you mu&s;t bring your Deeds to the Light of Chri&s;t, and abide in the Sen|tence of Condemnation; if you &s;ave your Lives, you lo&s;e them; if you will lo&s;e your Lives for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, there is no Danger of your eternal Life. <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, Chri&s;t's Forerunner, declared, <HI>I indeed baptize you with Water unto Repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, the Latchet of who&s;e Shoes I am not worthy to unloo&s;e, he &s;hall bap|tize you with the Holy Gho&s;t, and with Fire, who&s;e Fan is in his Hand, and he will throughly purge his Floor, and will gather his Wheat into his Garner, but the Chaff he will burn with unquench|able Fire.</HI> What is it the better for you to read the Scripture if you know not this fiery Bapti&s;m, which all mu&s;t know that are regenerated; deceive not your &s;elves, Chri&s;t will <HI>appear in flaming Fire, and take Vengeance on all them that know not God, and that obey not the Go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;tand here as a Witne&s;s of the Lord of Life this Day, there is no Way for People to come to Salvation, but they mu&s;t know Chri&s;t revealed in all their Hearts. What is he doing but rendring Vengeance upon the carnal Mind, &s;elf plea&s;ing, and all inordinate Affections; he comes with Vengeance to take away thy Life, he will baptize thee with the Holy Gho&s;t, and with Fire. If thou knowe&s;t not this, thou art not a true Chri&s;tian, thou wilt never look Death in the Face with Joy, nor go down to the Grave with Triumph. If thou live&s;t at home in the Body, and flye&s;t for thy Life, and wilt not be willing to lo&s;e thy Life for Chri&s;t, if thou art called to it, and if thou wilt nor have Chri&s;t to wa&s;h thee (&s;ome for Shyne&s;s, and &s;ome for Self-love will refu&s;e this) if Chri&s;t doth not wa&s;h thee, thou ha&s;t no Part in him; you mu&s;t come to Chri&s;t to purify you in the fiery Furnace; <HI>the Day of the Lord &s;hall burn as an Oven,</HI> (as the Prophet &s;peaks) this is a dreadful Day, a Day of Vengeance, the Day of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who redeemeth his People from their Sins, <HI>Sion is redeemed with Judgment, and e&s;tabli&s;hed with Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Do not make the Way to Heaven ea&s;ier in your Minds and Imaginations than indeed it is, and think it not &s;ufficient to live in an outward Ob&s;ervance of the Ways of God. If your own Wills be alive, and your Corruption remain unmortified, the Judgment of God will be your Portion, therefore in the Lord's Name come along with me, I am come to declare what I have heard and &s;een of the Father. Come and examine thy Con&s;cience, ha&s;t thou brought thy Deeds to the Light? then thou ha&s;t received Condemnation upon thy &s;elf, and thy Haughtine&s;s is bowed down, and laid low, and thou &s;ee&s;t thy &s;elf a poor mi&s;erable Wretch before the eternal God. What&s;oever thou knowe&s;t of the Mind of God, ha&s;t thou reformed thy Ways? Come along with me, and tell me what is the Ground of thy Faith, and thy Confidence; is it thy Obedience and Qualifications? Becau&s;e thy Obedience is right, and thy Qualifications right, what U&s;e do&s;t thou make of them? Read the Book of Con&s;cience; ha&s;t thou no Ground for thy Faith? Thou ha&s;t put on the reformed Faith, and live&s;t an unreformed Life; &s;earch and try thy &s;elf, Man, or Woman. Do&s;t thou watch over thy &s;elf, and keep in a Sen&s;e of thy Di&s;&s;olution, notwith&s;tanding all thy Qualifications and partial Reformation? Do&s;t thou <HI>&s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate, and the narrow Way?</HI> Here is the lo&s;t Sheep, thou &s;eeke&s;t, the Life of thy Will, the Life of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam;</HI> the Ju&s;tice of God will not &s;uffer thee to make a Saviour of thy Duties and Qualifications, and to take God's Jewels and to deck thy &s;elf with them; thou can&s;t not be &s;aved with|out the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. What &s;aith thy Con&s;cience, art thou brought to this Change of thy Mind, and of thy Conver&s;ation? Are you all willing to part with your Sins, with your Pride and Haughtine&s;s? Are you willing to part with your vile Affec|tions? This is the Work of God's Grace upon you. Do&s;t thou place thy Confidence in thy Duties and Qualifications, and take&s;t God's Jewels and Ornaments and decke&s;t thy &s;elf with them? <HI>Thou tooke&s;t my Jewels,</HI> &s;aith the Lord, <HI>and did&s;t play the Harlot.</HI> If thou return to the Lord, and humble thy &s;elf, and get thro' this Difficulty, thou wilt be happy for|ever. This Judgment of God, this flaming Sword that turns every Way, will keep thee from returning to Sin, and bring thee to Chri&s;t, and cut thee off from all Hope of Salvation but by him, and make thee to &s;ee the ab&s;olute need of a Saviour, and that thy <HI>Life is hid with Chri&s;t in God.</HI></P>
<P>It is God's infinite Goodne&s;s to Men that he will hide Pride from them, and humble them under his mighty Hand. This is the Condition of poor Creatures that are &s;lain by the Hands of the mo&s;t High: How may I know when I am &s;lain and baptized, and come to have Sincerity? They that have this Bapti&s;m enter into the Heavenly Life. If you love the Light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, it will be thus with you; God will make &s;hort work in the Earth. He will &s;et thy Sins in order before thee, and make thee watchful unto Prayer, and lead thee to Holine&s;s of Life and Conver&s;ation, and make thee abhor thy &s;elf, and de&s;pi&s;e all the Pomps and Plea&s;ures and Vanities of this World. When he hath adorned thee with his Graces, then watch for the Light, and in the Light of Chri&s;t thou &s;halt &s;ee Light, and that all thou ha&s;t done, and can&s;t do, is but thy Duty. All this thou oughte&s;t to do; thou art God's Creature, and all this will not ju&s;tifie thee in order to thy Eternal Salvation, for the&s;e Services thou owe&s;t unto God. If thou diligently wait, thou &s;halt &s;ee more Light; then the Sword that proceeds out of the Mouth of Chri&s;t, who is called the Word of God, will cut thee off from all thy Hopes of Salvation from any Thing thou ha&s;t done, from any of thy Qualifications, from any Thing that thou can&s;t do, &s;o that thou wilt be a hopele&s;s Soul, nothing in thy own Sen&s;e and Apprehen&s;ion. The Power of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> mu&s;t die before him, and thou wilt cry out, I am a dead, lo&s;t, and undone Creature, but there is a Life hid with Chri&s;t in God for me; but I can never have it till I be &s;lain into the Will of God, and become as a little Child, and be &s;tript of all my own Excellency that I have attained. I mu&s;t come to a Sen&s;e of my own Mi&s;ery, and fall down at the Foot of God; when I am become as a little Child, humbled and &s;lain as to my own Will, and Confidence in my own Righteou&s;ne&s;s; I will not then que&s;tion but I &s;hall live a holy Life, but I will give all that Life I had, for that <HI>Life which is hid with Chri&s;t in God;</HI> O! there is none come &s;o far, that ever mi&s;s of Eternal Life. All &s;huffling People that would have Salvation by Chri&s;t, and will not let him exerci&s;e his heavenly Power, his princely glorious Power to baptize them into his Death, it is they that come &s;hort of Salvation; but all tho&s;e that yield them&s;elves up to Chri&s;t to be redeemed thro' Judgment, and are become as little Children, the&s;e are in a happy State. You know that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t took a little Child in his Arms, and &s;aid. Who&s;oever becomes not as a little Child, cannot enter into the Kingdom of Hea+ven. You mu&s;t all of you become as little Children, and depend upon the Mercy and free Grace of God; you mu&s;t all come to a holy Re&s;ignation of your &s;elves to God's Di&s;po&s;al. If you come to Chri&s;t as little Children, and depend upon him, you cannot mi&s;s of Salva|tion; it is entailed upon &s;uch Souls as hear the Voice of Chri&s;t; they that hear the Voice of the Son of God &s;hall live.</P>
<P>I &s;tand here as a Witne&s;s for the God of Heaven. I never heard the Voice of Chri&s;t (as his Follower, till I was &s;lain and baptized, and lay as a little Child under his Heavenly Cha&s;ti&s;ements. A&s;&s;oon as ever my Soul was brought to this in my Humiliation, O then the dreadful Judgment was taken away, and the Book of Life was opened unto me, and the Lord &s;pake comfortably to me, <HI>I have loved thee with an everla&s;ting Love;</HI> and I was made a Chri&s;tian thro' a Day of Vengeance, and of burning as an Oven; and the Haughtine&s;s and Pride of Man in me was brought low. Now in this Conformity to Chri&s;t's Death, People may die into Life, and ble&s;&s;ed are the Dead that die in the Lord, for they re&s;t from their Labours, and their Works do follow them. Away with all your own Will, and your Pride, and Haughtine&s;s, and your Hypocri&s;y, and Deceit, and all Dependancy upon any Qualification of your own. You mu&s;t come to have your Life &s;eparated from you, el&s;e you will all peri&s;h. Tho&s;e that will die with Chri&s;t, and be willing to die for him, he is re|vealed as a Saviour to them. He was before us in the Days of his Fle&s;h, and complied with his Father's Will, he was nailed to the Cro&s;s. The Son of God, when he was come to the Depth of his Sufferings, what was his Cry? <HI>My God, my God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?</HI> This was for thy Sake, and my Sake, and every Man and Woman's Sake that do be|lieve in him; he drank the Cup which his Father gave him to drink; <HI>If it was done thus to the green Tree, what &s;hall be done unto the dry?</HI> He went before us, and when he cometh a|gain he will take us to him&s;elf, and take us from the Filth of Sin, that we may be made new Creatures.</P>
<P>Now except we be born again, we cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, and there is no becoming new Creatures, till we be &s;lain to the old Man. Thou mu&s;t be &s;lain to thy Pride and Haughtine&s;s, and the Corruption of thine own Will, and all Selfi&s;hne&s;s, thou mu&s;t have God to burn it up in thee; the Holy Gho&s;t will de&s;troy and burn up nothing in thee, but that which will bring an eternal Fire upon thy Soul; &s;hew me, thou whom my Soul lo|veth, where is the Path of Life, the Foot-&s;teps of the Flock of thy Companions? Why &s;hould I be as one that goes a&s;ide? Now every one that lives at home in the Bo&s;om of Self, take this with you, Tho' you profe&s;s the Truth, and live in an outward Conformity thereunto, yet if you &s;ecretly indulge your corrupt Wills, and live a Fle&s;h-plea&s;ing Life, and con&s;ult with Fle&s;h and Blood, and are not rent off from your Lu&s;ts, you cannot enjoy the Lord of Life; <HI>While I am at home in the Body, I am ab&s;ent from the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The Body of Sin is a Load&s;tone to draw you from the Life of God, and from glorying in the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t: This is Fle&s;h and Blood, and <HI>Fle&s;h and Blood cannot inherit the King|dom of God.</HI> For the Lord's Sake, for your Soul's Sake, and for the Sake of your Eternal Happine&s;s, put not off this Work, but pur&s;ue it, and it will be perfected. <HI>See how Chri&s;t is revealed in you by the Holy Gho&s;t, and with Fire.</HI> God will <HI>redeem you by the Spirit of Judg|ment and Burning:</HI> It is not ranging abroad with your Minds, but you mu&s;t know <HI>Chri&s;t is in you except ye he Reprobates.</HI> If he hath &s;et your Eyes and Hearts upon him&s;elf, and made you to <HI>water your Couch with your Tears;</HI> if he hath broken your Sleep, &s;o as you have cry'd out, I &s;hall be damned and never come to Salvation; (This will be your Cry, it was once my Cry,) O let not your Eyes &s;lumber, nor your Eyelids take any Re&s;t, till you be &s;ure the Lord is your God. If you find the&s;e Qualifications, you are on your Way, otherwi&s;e you will be like a deceitful Bow, and never abide in Judgment. If you reject the Coun&s;el of God again&s;t your &s;elves, and refu&s;e to be crucified with Chri&s;t, and to be baptized with his Bapti&s;m, you will never have Life; but by his Bapti&s;m, and thro' the heavenly Operation of his Spirit, if thou ha&s;t Faith in Chri&s;t's Name, thou &s;halt be married to him in everla&s;ting Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Salvation &s;hall be brought to us, and eternal. Life be be&s;towed upon us, even that Life which is hid with Chri&s;t in God, he will give to every poor mournful Soul, that &s;ubmits to his ble&s;&s;ed Will, and believeth in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: This is not a Faith of our own making, nor a Garment of our own Em|broidery, but that which the Lord hath given to us. O happy Man or Woman, that obtaine&s;t this Gift of God! O! Who will not lo&s;e their Lives for this everla&s;ting Life? Who will not die for this eternal Life? Now the Matter lies in the Death of your own Wills, when you have done the Will of God, then watch that your own Wills be &s;lain, and that your cur&s;ed Self take not the Jewels of God, and his Bracelets and Ornaments, and be&s;tow them upon Self, and paint and deck cur&s;ed Self; and take not the Members of Chri&s;t, and make them the Members of an Harlot: If you be dead to your own Wills you are ri&s;en with Chri&s;t, and &s;hall receive a Re&s;urrection to eternal Life: Crucifie Self, and &s;et the World at nought, and trample upon it, and all Things of it, and count them as Dro&s;s and Dung in compari&s;on of Chri&s;t, that the Father hath revealed to be our Life, in the Days of our Sorrow and Mourning, in the Day of our Calamity, in the Day when we cried, our Hope is lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus it hath been with the holie&s;t People on Earth. It is not by Works of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of thy own that thou can&s;t be &s;aved; Chri&s;t comes to cut all the&s;e down, that thou may&s;t be ingrafted into him, and ju&s;tified by his Grace. Do not make this Matter of Talk, and &s;ay, I have heard this and that, but look into your own Hearts, and &s;ee what heavenly Workings are there; what there is of the Power of the Lord Je&s;us, that hath made you to loath this World, and the inordinate Love of the Creature, that you may enjoy all the&s;e Things, as if you enjoyed them not. We cannot when we are &s;lain and crucified to this World, but &s;ay, My Life is in Chri&s;t, when we come to a&s;cribe nothing to our &s;elves, and all to Chri&s;t; here is a ble&s;&s;ed Harmony, broken Hearts, melted Spi|rits, and yet joyful Souls; poor Creatures that were mourning and &s;ighing, and crying before the Lord in retired Places, and yet rejoicing in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. I am ri&s;en with Chri&s;t, I &s;aid, my Hope is cut off, I will lie down in thy Will, O God; do what thou wilt with me, it is in thy &s;overeign Plea&s;ure and free Gift, whether thou give me Life, or deny it to me. There mu&s;t be a Re&s;ignation of our &s;elves to the Will of God; it was &s;o with the Lord Je&s;us, and it is &s;o with every true Saint of God; you mu&s;t be humbled as little Children before Judgment be taken away, and the Loving-kindne&s;s of God &s;ealed up to your Souls. If you &s;eek this Work of God, you will find it; if you &s;eek it upon your Beds, in all your Labours and Concernments, in all your Stations and Relations; if you pre&s;s after the New Birth, you mu&s;t u&s;e this World, as if you u&s;ed it not, and live a married Life, as if you were unmarried, for the Fa&s;hion of this World pa&s;&s;eth away. This is not Ranti&s;m.</P>
<P>But let me tell you, a New World comes by Regeneration; a Man is not lifted up in his own Mind, but laid low in his own Eyes, he waits for the Wi&s;dom of God to govern him, and he is as a Steward of the Grace of God, to give to them that &s;tand in need. When a Man is regenerated and born again, he is as contented with Bread and Water, as with all the Enjoyments of this World: What is the Matter? His own Will is gone, and put down under his Feet, and what&s;oever it is that gives Life to all his vain De&s;ires and Affections, there is a Harmony of all within, a Man prai&s;ing of God, and ble&s;&s;ing his Holy Name; there are no Intanglements &s;hall draw away the Heart from &s;erving of God, and &s;eeking his Glory; and if God &s;hall call the Husband from the Wife, or the Wife from the Husband for the Glory of his Name, there is no whining, and complain|ing, and crying out, but giving them up, and a prai&s;ing and ble&s;&s;ing God when they are called to &s;uch an Exerci&s;e; and if they are not called to that, then they &s;et their Hearts to glorifie God in their &s;everal Places and Stations; then they have a full Content in a ble&s;&s;ed Re&s;ignation. Here their Wills are &s;lain, but they prai&s;e God they have no De|&s;ire, but Lord thy Will be done; always prai&s;ing God, always having the Fear, and the Glory of God before their Eyes. All the Mi&s;chief is hatch'd in plea&s;ing Mens own Wills: That is, the Coun&s;el of every Heart that Chri&s;t doth not govern: Will you live as the <HI>Quakers?</HI> Then you mu&s;t live contemptibly, the Mi&s;tre&s;s and Maid are Hail-fel|low, well met. No, every one mu&s;t walk in Humility, and live in Acquaintance with the God of Heaven; &s;he that is wrought upon by the &s;ame Spirit, mu&s;t with all Diligence behave her&s;elf as becomes a Servant of the Lord. Here is now a New World, and the Fa&s;hions of the Old World are gone; all Pride, Haughtine&s;s, Cro&s;&s;ne&s;s and trampling upon one another are all gone, all &s;lain, thro' the Operation of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>What remains now? Chri&s;t is in me, and we are all one in him. Chri&s;t laid down his Life for thee and me; now he reigns in me, and he hath prepared my Body to die for the Truth, as his prepared Body was laid down for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y Sin. It is a kind of fooli&s;h Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, to make Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and live in Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Profanene&s;s, Sen&s;uality, and the like; they that are come to this heavenly Birth &s;eek the Things that are above, thou can&s;t do no other. <HI>Make the Tree good, and the Fruit will be good.</HI> You mu&s;t be in|grafted into the Vine of God's Righteou&s;ne&s;s: O! &s;light not the Day of your Vi&s;itation. What was it to me to read of any being born again, till I was &s;lain, and knew the hea|venly Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t Je&s;us? Till I &s;aw the flaming Sword ready to &s;lay me in every Way, in every Turning. The Light of Chri&s;t convinced me of Sin, and his Righteou&s;|ne&s;s ju&s;tified me, and tho&s;e Works were abominable to me, that hindred my Soul's Pa&s;|&s;age to Chri&s;t. Chri&s;t Je&s;us in marrying my Soul to him&s;elf, &s;eized upon me, and did work effectually in me: There is the Te&s;timony of Chri&s;t in me, he hath &s;ealed up my Soul to the Day of my Redemption: Here is a certain Pa&s;&s;age, and a certain Way which never any mi&s;s of, that lo&s;e their Lives for Chri&s;t: If you be not ready and willing to lo&s;e your Lives for Chri&s;t, you &s;hall never come here: The Gate is &s;traight, and the Way is narrow; none come hither but tho&s;e that die into a heavenly Onene&s;s with Chri&s;t. O Friends, let us empty our &s;elves, that Chri&s;t may fill us; let us be nothing in our own Eyes, that we may be all in him, and receive of his Fulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Now I commend you to God's Witne&s;s, that you may remember what hath been &s;po|ken among you; but con&s;ider, if you do not hearken to it, it will follow you, and be a Plague to you to all Eternity. If you will not yield up your &s;elves to Chri&s;t this Day that burns like an Oven, this Fire you mu&s;t dwell with when out of the Body, there will be no quenching of this Fire for ever; but if you be &s;o wi&s;e for your Souls, as to re&s;ign your &s;elves up to Chri&s;t, and come to him as little Children, this will not hinder your earthly Concerns. Tho' the World may account thee a Fool, yet thou ha&s;t that Part of heavenly Wi&s;dom, to do what thou do&s;t as unto God; thou carrie&s;t to thy Wife, as in the &s;ight of God, that &s;he may be &s;anctified to thee, and thou to her; and thou carrie&s;t be|comingly to thy Children and Servants, and thou wilt abound in Grace, and in every good Work, which will be for thine Eternal Welfare.</P>
<P>O! I be&s;eech you People, for the Lord's &s;ake, wait for the Light of Chri&s;t to guide you; learn of him to be meek and lowly, then happy are you; for <HI>he dwelleth with the Humble, but he beholdeth the Proud afar off.</HI> This New Birth, which is a true Work, a &s;incere and heavenly Work, it will make you for ever. O make Room for Chri&s;t in your Hearts, or el&s;e he is never like to dwell with you. He loveth to dwell with the poor and humble and contrite Spirit, he abhors the Proud, he will empty your Souls, that he may fill them.</P>
<P>And &s;o I commend you to God. I have been long held in Durance under great Weak|ne&s;s; and I was re&s;tle&s;s, till I could come up to this great City of <HI>London,</HI> to preach the Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel among you, and you &s;ee I am among you here: Pray every one of you turn inward; let not the&s;e Words pa&s;&s;ing thro' a mean Ve&s;&s;el be as a bare empty Di&s;cour&s;e of Truth to you, which you only hear, and take no further Care of your Sal|vation. Take heed of de&s;pi&s;ing the Light that &s;hines in the mid&s;t of you, and be pre&s;&s;ing forward to the heavenly Work that is laid in the Power of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, even thro' Judg|ment into Death, and then he will give eternal Life. The Lord confirm this, that it may re&s;t upon your Hearts, that you may be dead to the Things of the World. <HI>We are not come to Mount</HI> Sinai, <HI>that genders to Bondage, but we are come to Mount</HI> Sion, <HI>the City of the Li|ving God, the heavenly</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>and to an innumerable Company of Angels, to the general A&s;&s;em|bly, and Church of the Fir&s;t-born which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect, and to Je&s;us the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the Blood of Sprinkling, that &s;peaketh better Things than that of</HI> Abel. This is the Inheritance of the Redeemed of the mo&s;t High, ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the Lord; let us re&s;t in Hope, till he bring us to Humility and Lowline&s;s of Mind, that he may cloath us with heavenly Glory, according to his Promi&s;e, <HI>I will beautifie my Hou&s;e with Glory, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> This is the Portion of a poor People, that ca&s;t down them&s;elves before the Lord, that he may lift them up, and be all in all to them, in who&s;e ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Pre&s;ence they &s;hall have Joy, and Rivers of Plea&s;ures at his Right hand for evermore.</HI></P>

<P>As to State Affairs, there now appeared a wonderful Agitation in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> &s;ince it was reported that the Queen was big with Child.

<P>In an&s;wer to this, Thanks were given to the Prince for his Care and Pains in Defence of the People, their Religion and Laws. And all Things took a favourable Turn for him.</P>
<P>In <HI>Holland</HI> a good while before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;ly Paper publi&s;hed in <HI>Holland</HI></NOTE> a Paper was given forth in Print cal|led, <HI>A Copy of a Letter written by a</HI> Quaker <HI>at</HI> London, <HI>to his Friend at</HI> Rotterdam.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>DEarly beloved <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Brethren,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Epi&s;tle of <HI>S. Cri&s;p,</HI> writ worthy the &s;eri|ous Con&s;iderati|on of all, but par|ticularly of &s;uch as may be con|cern'd in the Management of the Affairs of the Church</NOTE> gathered out of the World by the eternal Arm and Power of the mighty God, to bear his holy Name in your Generation; my Love and Life in the Fellow&s;hip of the univer&s;al Spirit &s;alutes you all, and my Prayer to God is, you may be kept &s;tedfa&s;t and immoveable in the Grace of God, and in the Com|munion of his holy Spirit, that ye may bring forth Fruit in Abundance, according to the abundant Mercy and Grace be&s;towed upon you, to the Glory of God, and to your mutual Joy, Comfort, and Edification.</P>
<P>And that you may &s;o do, let your Eye be kept daily to the Lord, and behold and take Notice of the wondrous Works that he hath wrought in you, and for you, &s;ince the Day ye were fir&s;t quickened by his <HI>immortal Word,</HI> and &s;tirred up to &s;eek after him, and to wait upon him; how good and gracious he hath been to you, in bringing you from the barren Mountains, where your Souls langui&s;hed for the heavenly Nouri&s;hment, where you knew not the Lord, nor one another, but were without a Comforter, or any to &s;ympathize with you in your Mournings: Oh, how hath he pitied your Groanings, and had Compa&s;&s;ion on your Sighings, and brought you into Acquaint|ance with tho&s;e that were in the like Exerci&s;es; and then he taught you to believe on him that was able to help you: And tho&s;e that were thus taught of the Father, and felt his drawing Cords of Love prevailing upon them; the&s;e came to Chri&s;t their Saviour, and in him began to feel a Unity one with another, in the Faith you had received in him; whereby you believed he would give you of his Spirit to teach and guide you in the Way of Truth, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace; and thus was the Foundation of your holy Communion laid, and a lively Hope rai&s;ed in each particular Soul, that he that had begun this ble&s;&s;ed Work would carry it on; and this Hope made you that ye were not a&s;hamed to make a publick Profe&s;&s;ion of his Name before the World, but cheerfully to take up his Cro&s;s, and deny your &s;elves of your for|mer Plea&s;ures, Friend&s;hips, and Delights of this World: This Hope hath been your Support in many &s;harp Trials, and bitter Combats you have had with the Enemy of your Soul's Peace within, and with the Enemies of God's holy Way and Truth without; and in all your Conflicts you have &s;ound him nigh at Hand, to put forth his Power on your Behalf, as you have depended upon him for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and by the&s;e Experiences of his Goodne&s;s, your Faith hath been &s;trengthned; and by the &s;ame <HI>Word of Life</HI> that quickned you, many more have been reached unto, &s;o that you have &s;een a daily Addi|tion of Strength in the Particular, and al&s;o an Addition to your Num|ber, to your great Comfort and Encouragement; and many have come to wait upon the Lord among you, and many are daily enquiring the Way to <HI>Zion,</HI> with their Faces thitherward. The&s;e Things are worth your Remembrance, and &s;erious Con&s;iderations, that you may look up|on the&s;e great Mercies, as Obligations upon your Souls to walk hum|bly before the Lord, and to be devout and fervent in your Te&s;timony, for that God that hath done thus great Things for you.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Friends,</HI> con&s;ider of the great Works that this mighty Arm of the Lord hath brought to pa&s;s in the general, as well as in the particu|lar; how many Contrivances have been framed, and Laws and Decrees made to lay you wa&s;te, and to make you cea&s;e to be a People, and how
<PB N="602" REF="003104_0613_0FEFF8F5393E53D0">have the Wicked rejoiced thereat, (for a Sea&s;on) crying, <HI>Ah, ha! thus would we have it; they are all now given up to Bani&s;hments, to Impri|&s;onments, to Spoils and Ruins; now let us &s;ee if that invi&s;ible Arm they tru&s;t in can deliver them.</HI> Oh Friends! how hath your God been your Support in the Mid&s;t of all the&s;e Exerci&s;es? And when he hath plea&s;ed, how hath he quieted the &s;harpe&s;t Storms, and turned back the greate&s;t Floods and Torrents of Per&s;ecution that ever you met? And how hath he confounded his and your Enemies, and brought Confu|&s;ion upon the Heads of them that &s;ought your Hurt? Were not the&s;e Things wrought by the Power of God? Did your Number, your Poli|cy, your Intere&s;t, or any Thing that might be called your own, contri|bute any Thing to the&s;e your great Pre&s;ervations and Deliverances? If not, then let God have the Glory, and acknowledge to his Prai&s;e, The&s;e have been the Lord's Doings, and are marvellous in our Eyes.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Dear Friends,</HI> con&s;ider how the wicked One hath wrought in a My&s;tery among your &s;elves, to &s;catter you, and to lay you wa&s;te from being a People as at this Day; how many &s;everal Ways hath he tried, rai&s;ing up Men of perver&s;e Minds, to &s;ubvert, and to turn you from the Faith, and from the Simplicity that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord, and to &s;eparate you from that invi&s;ible Power that hath been your Strength, and to &s;eparate you one from another, and by &s;ubtile Wiles, to lead you into a fal&s;e Liberty above the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t; and &s;ometimes by &s;owing Seeds of <HI>Here&s;y</HI> and <HI>Seditions,</HI> endeavouring to corrupt the Minds of whom they could with pernicious Principles; but oh, how have their De&s;igns been fru&s;trated, and the Authors thereof confounded and brought to nought! And how have you been pre&s;erved as a Flock under the Hand of a careful Shepherd, even unto this Day, which mi|ni&s;ters great Cau&s;e of Thank&s;giving unto all the Faithful, who have witne&s;&s;ed the Working of this pre&s;erving Power in their own Particulars.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, <HI>My Friends,</HI> it is worth your Con&s;iderations, to behold how that by this invi&s;ible Power, &s;o many faithful Watchmen are rai&s;ed up upon the Walls of your <HI>Zion,</HI> that in mo&s;t of your Meetings there be Men and Women, upon whom God hath laid a Concern to be taking Care for the Good of the Whole, and to take the Over&s;ight upon them, to &s;ee all Things kept in good and decent Order, and to make due Pro|vi&s;ion for the comforting and relieving the Nece&s;&s;ities of the Needy and Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, that nothing be lacking to make your Way comforta|ble; and the&s;e have not been, nor are brought under this Charge by any Act of yours, but God hath rai&s;ed up <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>Teachers, Elders</HI> and <HI>Deacons</HI> of his own Election and Choice, and bowed their Spirits to take upon them the Work and Service to which they are appointed, for the Lord's-&s;ake, and for the Body's-&s;ake, which is the Church, to whom it may truly be &s;aid, as in <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 28. <HI>Take ye heed to the Flock of God, over which the Holy Gho&s;t hath made you Over&s;eers,</HI> &amp;c. And &s;uch ought to be hearkned to in the Di&s;charge of their Tru&s;t, as tho&s;e that mu&s;t give an Account to him that called them, and gifted them for their &s;everal Works and Services in the Church.</P>
<P>And by the&s;e Ways and Means hath the Lord e&s;tabli&s;hed among you a heavenly Government, and built as it were a Hedge about you, that ye may be pre&s;erved from Generation to Generation, a People fitted for the Glory that is, and &s;hall daily more and more be revealed among and upon the Faithful, who delight in that Power that called them to be Saints, and to bear a Profe&s;&s;ion for the holy Name of God again&s;t the many Names and Ways that Men in their changeable Minds have &s;et up, that the Name of the Lord alone may be exalted.</P>
<P>And, <HI>dear Friends</HI> and <HI>Brethren,</HI> I intreat you, that the Con&s;ideration of the&s;e great and weighty Things which God hath wrought for you,
<PB N="603" REF="003104_0614_0FEFF93A29299130">and among you, may have that deep and weighty Influence upon your Souls, that ye may find your &s;elves engaged to an&s;wer the Love and Mercy of God in your Lives and Conver&s;ations, and in all you have to do in this World, that ye may &s;hew forth the Honour of God in all Things, that the Light which hath &s;hined in you, may &s;hine forth thro' you unto others, who yet &s;it in Darkne&s;s; that all Men may know by your innocent and harmle&s;s Conver&s;ations, and by your clo&s;e keeping to the Lord, that ye are a People who are a&s;&s;i&s;ted and help|ed by a &s;upernatural Power, which governs your Wills, and &s;ubjects them to his ble&s;&s;ed Will, and that guides and orders your Affections, and &s;ets them upon heavenly and divine Objects, and that gives you Power to deny your own private Intere&s;ts, where they happen to &s;tand in Competition with the Intere&s;t of Truth; for the&s;e and the&s;e only, will be found the true Di&s;ciples of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who can deny them&s;elves, take up a Cro&s;s daily, and follow him in the Guidance of his regenerating Power, which brings Death upon Self, and crucifies the old Nature, with its Affections and Lu&s;ts, and rai&s;eth up a Birth in you, that hath a holy Will, and De&s;ire to &s;erve the Lord, and do his Will in the Earth; and &s;uch as the&s;e are In&s;truments in the Hand of God for him to work by, and to do Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, of Ju&s;tice, of Charity, and all other the Virtues belonging to a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Life, to the Honour of God, and for the Comfort and Benefit of his Church and People.
And all you, <HI>dear Friends,</HI> upon whom the Lord hath laid a Care for his Honour, and for the Pro&s;perity of the Truth, and gathered you into the good Order of the Go&s;pel, to meet together to manage the Affairs thereof; take Heed that ye have a &s;ingle Eye to the Lord, to do the Lord's Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Leadings of his Spirit, which is but one, and brings all (that are given up to be governed by it) to be of one Mind and Heart, at lea&s;t in the general Purpo&s;e and Service of tho&s;e Meetings; altho' thro' the Diver&s;ity of Exerci&s;es, and the &s;everal Degrees of Growth among the Brethren, every one may not &s;ee or un|der&s;tand alike in every Matter, at the fir&s;t propounding of it; yet this makes no Breach of the Unity, nor hinders the Brotherly-kindne&s;s, but puts you often upon an Exerci&s;e, and an inward travelling to feel the pure peaceable Wi&s;dom that is from above, to open among you, and every one's Ear is open to it, in whom&s;oever it &s;peaks, and thereby a Sen&s;e of Life is given in the Meeting, to which all that are of a &s;imple and tender Mind, join and agree: But if any among you &s;hould be con|trary minded in the Management of &s;ome outward Affair, relating to the Truth, this doth not pre&s;ently break the Unity that ye have in Chri&s;t, nor &s;hould weaken the brotherly Love, &s;o long as he keeps waiting for an Under&s;tanding from God, to be gathered into the &s;ame Sen&s;e with you, and walks with you according to the Law of Cha|rity, &s;uch a one ought to be born with, and cheri&s;hed, and the Sup|plications of your Souls will go up to God for him, that God may re|veal it to him, if it be his Will, that &s;o no Difference may be in Un|der&s;tanding, &s;o far as is nece&s;&s;ary for the Good of the Church, no more than there is in Matters of Faith and Obedience to God; For, <HI>My Friends,</HI> it is not of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity that every Member of the Church &s;hould have the &s;ame Mea&s;ure of Under&s;tanding in all Things; for then where were the Duty of the Strong bearing with the Weak? Then where were the Brother of low Degree? Where would be any &s;ubmitting to them that were &s;et over others in the Lord, which all tend to the pre&s;erving Unity in the Church, notwith&s;tanding the dif|ferent Mea&s;ures, and different Growths of the Members thereof; for as the Spirits of the Prophets are &s;ubject to the Prophets, &s;o are the
<PB N="604" REF="003104_0615_0FEFF8F70523CBC0">Spirits of all that are kept in a true Subjection to the Spirit of Life in them&s;elves, kept in the &s;ame Subjection to the Sen&s;e of Life given by the &s;ame Spirit in the Church; and by this Means we come to know the one Ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t, and have no Room for other Ma&s;ters in the Ma&s;ter of our Obedience to God; and while every one keeps in this true Subjection, the &s;weet Concord is known, and the Oil is not only upon <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Head, but it reacheth the Skirts of his Garment al&s;o; and Things are kept &s;weet and &s;avoury, and ye love one another from the greate&s;t to the lea&s;t in Sincerity, and (as the Apo&s;tle &s;aith) <HI>without Di&s;&s;imulation;</HI> and this Love excludes all <HI>Whi&s;perings of evil Things;</HI> all <HI>Back-biting, Tale-bearing, Grudgings,</HI> and <HI>Murmurings;</HI> and keeps Friends Minds clean one towards another, waiting for every Op|portunity to do each other Good, and to pre&s;erve each others Repu|tation; and their Hearts are comforted at the Sight of one another; and in all their Affairs, both relating to the Church, and to the World, they will be watchful over their own Spirits, and keep in the Lord's Power, over that Nature and Ground in them&s;elves that would be apt to take an Offence, or con&s;true any Word or Action to a wor&s;e Sen&s;e than the Simplicity thereof, or the Intention of the other concerned will allow of.</P>
<P>And whereas it may often fall out, that among a great many, &s;ome may have a different Apprehen&s;ion of a Matter from the re&s;t of their Brethren, e&s;pecially in outward or temporal Things, there ought to be a Chri&s;tian Liberty maintained for &s;uch to expre&s;s their Sen&s;e, with Freedom of Mind, or el&s;e they will go away burden'd; whereas if they &s;peak their Minds freely, and a friendly and Chri&s;tian Conference be admitted thereupon, they may be ea&s;ed, and oftentimes the different Apprehen&s;ion of &s;uch an one comes to be wholly removed, and his Under&s;tanding opened, to &s;ee as the re&s;t &s;ee; for the Danger in Society doth not lie &s;o much in that, that &s;ome few may have a differing Ap|prehen&s;ion in &s;ome Things from the general Sen&s;e, as it doth in this; namely, when &s;uch that &s;o differ do &s;uffer them&s;elves to be led out of the Bond of Charity, and &s;hall labour to impo&s;e their private Sen&s;e upon the re&s;t of their Brethren, and to be offended and angry if it be not received, this is the Seed of Sedition and Strife that hath grown up in too too many, to their own Hurt.</P>
<P>And therefore, <HI>my dear Friends,</HI> beware of it, and &s;eek not to drive a Matter on in Fiercene&s;s or in Anger, nor to take Offence into your Minds at any Time, becau&s;e what &s;eems to be clear to you is not pre|&s;ently received; but let all Things in the Church be propounded with an awful Reverence of him that is the Head and Life of it; who hath &s;aid, <HI>Where two or three are met in my Name, I will be in the Mid&s;t of them:</HI> And &s;o he is, and may be felt by all who keep in his Spirit; but he that follows his own Spirit, &s;ees nothing as he ought to &s;ee it. Therefore let all beware of their own Spirits and natural Tempers, (as they are &s;ometimes called) but let all keep in a gracious Temper, then are ye fit for the Service of the Hou&s;e of God, who&s;e Hou&s;e ye are, as ye keep upon the Foundation that God hath laid; and he will build you up, and teach you how to build up one another in him, and as every Member mu&s;t feel Life in them&s;elves, and all from one Head; this Life will not hurt it &s;elf in any, but be tender of the Life in all; for by this one Life of the WORD ye were begotten, and by it ye are nouri&s;hed, and made to grow into your &s;everal Services in the Church of God; it is no Man's Learning, nor artificial Acquirement<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; it's no Man's Riches nor Greatne&s;s in this World; it's no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Elo|quence and natural Wi&s;dom, that makes him fit for Government in the Church of Chri&s;t, unle&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with all his Endowments, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">&s;ome

<P>Oh <HI>Friends!</HI> great is the Work the Lord hath called you to, and is a fitting you for, who innocently wait upon him; and the Lord hath opened my Heart unto you, and laid it upon me to exhort and be|&s;eech to have a Care that ye quit your &s;elves as ye ought, in what God requires of ye; and for the more particular expre&s;&s;ing what lies before me in the Matter, I &s;hall &s;et down a few particular Observations for your Benefit and Advantage; and my Soul's De&s;ire is, that my La|bour of Love may have a good Effect in all your Bo&s;oms, that God may be honoured thereby. And, Friends, ye know the chief Bu&s;ine&s;s, to which ye are called in your particular Men and Women's Meetings, is under the&s;e two Heads, Ju&s;tice and Charity; the fir&s;t, to &s;ee that every one hath Right done him, and the other to take Care there be nothing lacking to the Comfort of the Poor that are made Partakers of the &s;ame Faith with you.</P>
<P>And when ye meet about the&s;e Things, keep the Lord in your Eye, and wait to feel his Power to guide and direct you, to &s;peak and behave your &s;elves in the Church of God, as becomes the peaceable Go&s;pel: And beware of all Brittlene&s;s of Spirit, and &s;harp Reflection upon each others Words; for that will kindle up Heats, and create a fal&s;e Fire, and when one takes a Liberty of a &s;harp Word &s;poken out of the true Fear and Tenderne&s;s, it oftentimes becomes a Temptation to another; and if he hath not a great Care, it will draw him out al&s;o, and then the fir&s;t is guilty of two Evils, fir&s;t being led into a Temptation, and then &s;econdly, he becomes a Tempter to others; therefore all had need be upon their Watch, neither to tempt, nor be tempted; and let none think it a &s;ufficient Excu&s;e for them that they were provoked; for we are as an&s;werable to God for every evil Word &s;poken upon Pro|vocation, as without Provocation; for, for that End hath the Lord re|vealed his Power to us, to keep and pre&s;erve us in his Fear and Coun&s;el in the Time of our Provocations; and therefore if any Man thro' Want of Watchfulne&s;s, &s;hould be overtaken with Heat or Pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>a &s;oft An&s;wer appea&s;eth Wrath,</HI> &s;aith the wife Man; and therefore &s;uch a Time is fitte&s;t for a &s;oft An&s;wer, le&s;t the Enemy prevail on any to their Hurt, and to the Grief and Trouble of their Brethren; for it is the proper Duty of Watchmen and Over&s;eers, to &s;pare the Flock, that is, let nothing come nigh them that will hurt them, and wound and grieve them: Nay, the good Apo&s;tle was &s;o careful over the Flock of Believers, that if there were any doubtful Matters to be di&s;puted of, he would not have them that were weak in the Faith at &s;uch Di&s;putes, much le&s;s ought they that are weak to &s;ee tho&s;e that are &s;trong de&s;cend from their Strength, and go into the Weakne&s;s where they are not able to bear, for that is certainly the weak that cannot bear; tho&s;e that really live in the Strength and Power, they can bear even Burdens for</P>

<P>In the next Place, <HI>My dear Friends,</HI> when ye are called upon in Point of Ju&s;tice, to give a Sentence of Right between Friend and Friend, take heed that neither Party get Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your Spirit aforehand, by any Way or Means what&s;oever, or obtain any Word or Sentence from you in the Ab&s;ence of the other Party, he not being yet heard: There is nothing more comely among Men than impartial Judgment; Judgment is a Seat, where neither Intere&s;t nor Affection, nor former Kindne&s;&s;es may come; we may make no Difference of the Worthine&s;s or Unworthine&s;s of Per&s;ons in Judgment, as we may in Charity; but in Judgment, if a good Man, being mi&s;taken, hath a bad Cau&s;e, or a bad Man a good Cau&s;e, according to his Cau&s;e mu&s;t he have Sentence: It was a good Saying, <HI>He that judgeth among Men, judgeth for the Lord, and he will repay it.</HI> Therefore let all be done as unto the Lord, and as ye are willing to an&s;wer it in his Pre&s;ence; and altho' &s;ome may for a Time be di&s;content thereat, yet in Time God &s;hall clear up your In|nocency as the Sun at Noon-day; and they that kick at &s;ound Judg|ment, will find but hard Work of it, they do but kick again&s;t that which will prick them; and however &s;uch, thro' their Wilfulne&s;s, and their abounding in their own Sen&s;e may hurt them&s;elves, yet you will be pre&s;erved, and enjoy your Peace and Satisfaction in the Di&s;|charge of your Con&s;ciences in the Sight of God.</P>
<P>And as concerning practical <HI>Charity,</HI> ye know it's &s;upported by Li|berality, and where Liberality cea&s;eth, Charity waxeth cold, yea, &s;o far cea&s;eth; where there is no Contribution, there is no Di&s;tribution; where the one is &s;paring, the other is &s;paring; and therefore let every one nouri&s;h Charity in the Root, that is, keep a liberal Mind, a Heart that looks upon the Sub&s;tance that is given him, as really be&s;towed up|on him for the Support of Charity, as for the Support of his own Body; and where People are of this Mind, they will have a Care of keeping back any of God's Part, for he hath in all Ages in a mo&s;t &s;in|gular Manner, e&s;pou&s;ed the Cau&s;e of the Poor, the Widow, and Father|le&s;s, and hath often &s;ignified by his Prophets and Mini&s;ters, a &s;pecial Charge upon rich Men that had this World's Goods, that they &s;hould look to it that they were faithful Stewards of what they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and that they might be found in good Works, and might not &s;uffer their Hearts &s;o to cleave to uncertain Riches, as to neglect the Service God had given them the Things of this Life for, either to give them up when called for in a Te&s;timony of his worthy Name, or to communi|cate of them to tho&s;e that were in Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Now as concerning the Nece&s;&s;ities of the Poor, there is great Need of Wi&s;dom, when ye meet together about that Affair; for as I &s;aid before, tho' the Worthine&s;s or Unworthine&s;s of Per&s;ons is not to be con&s;idered in Judgment, yet in this it is; and you will find &s;ome that God hath made poor, and &s;ome that have made them&s;elves poor, and &s;ome that others have made poor, which mu&s;t all have their &s;everal Con&s;iderations, in which you ought to labour to be unanimous, and not one to be taken up with an Affection to one Per&s;on more than ano|ther, but every one to love every one in the univer&s;al Spirit, and then to deal out that Love in the outward Manife&s;tations thereof, accord|ing to the Mea&s;ure that the Lord in his Wi&s;dom working in you &s;hall mea&s;ure forth to them.</P>
<P><PB N="607" REF="003104_0618_0FEFF94097B8F3C8">And as to tho&s;e who by <HI>Sickne&s;s, Lamene&s;s, Age,</HI> or other Impo|tency, are brought into Poverty by the Hand of Providence; the&s;e are your peculiar Care, and Objects pointed out to you, to be&s;tow your Charity upon, for by them the Lord calls for it; for as the Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulne&s;s of it, he hath by his &s;overeign Power com|manded in every Di&s;pen&s;ation, that a Part of what we enjoy from him, &s;hould be thus employed: The <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were not to reap the Corners of their Fields, nor to gather the Gleanings of the Corn nor Vintage, it was for the Poor; and in the Time of the Go&s;pel they were to lay apart, on the <HI>Fir&s;t-day</HI> of the Week, a Part of what God had ble&s;&s;ed them with, for the Relief of tho&s;e that were in Nece&s;&s;ity; nay, they did not confine them&s;elves in their Charity to their own Meetings, but had an univer&s;al Eye thro' the whole Church of Chri&s;t, and upon ex|traordinary Occa&s;ions, &s;ent their Benevolence to relieve the Saints at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in a Time of Need; and all that keep in the Guidance of the &s;ame univer&s;al Spirit, will make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to be found in the &s;ame Practice of <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>good Works; To do Good, and to com|municate, forget not,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle: So they that forget not this <HI>Chri&s;tian Duty,</HI> will find out the Poors Part in the Corners and Glean|ings of the Profits of their Trades and Merchandizings, as well as the old <HI>I&s;raelite</HI> did the Corners and Gleanings of his Field; and in the Di&s;tribution of it, will have a Regard to comfort the Bowels of &s;uch, who are by the divine Providence of God put out of a Capacity of en|joying tho&s;e outward Comforts of Health, and Strength, and Plenty, which others do enjoy; for while they are Partakers of the &s;ame Faith, and walk in the Way of Righteou&s;ne&s;s with you, &s;ubmitting them|&s;elves patiently to the Di&s;pen&s;ation of God's Providence towards them, they are of your Hou&s;hold, and under your Care, both to vi&s;it, and to relieve as Members of one Body, of which Chri&s;t Je&s;us is Head; and he that giveth to &s;uch Poor, lendeth to the Lord, and he will repay it.</P>
<P>But there is another Sort of Poor, who make them&s;elves poor thro' their Sloth and Carele&s;sne&s;s, and &s;ometimes by their Wilfulne&s;s, be|ing heady and high-minded, and taking Things in Hand that are more than they can manage, and make a Flouri&s;h for a Sea&s;on, and then thro' their own Neglects, are plunged down into great Poverty: The&s;e are a Sort the Primitive Churches began to be troubled withal in the early Days of the Go&s;pel; for the Apo&s;tle took Notice of &s;ome that would not work at all, and &s;harply reproved them, and &s;aid, <HI>They that would not work &s;hould not eat;</HI> and the&s;e are commonly a Sort of Bu&s;y-bodies, and Meddlers with others Matters, while they neglect their own, and run into a wor&s;e Way than the Unbelievers, while they profe&s;s to be Believers, yet do not take a due Care for tho&s;e of their own Hou&s;hold.</P>
<P>The Charity that is proper to &s;uch, is to give them Admonition and Reproof, and to convince them of their Sloth and Negligence; and if they &s;ubmit to your Reproof, and are willing to amend, then Care ought to be taken to help them into a Way and Means to &s;upport them&s;elves; and &s;ometimes by a little Help in this Kind, &s;ome have been reclaimed from the Snares of their Soul's Enemy: But if they will not receive your whol&s;ome Coun&s;el and Admonitions, but kick again&s;t it, either in their Words or Actions, Friends will be clear of &s;uch in the Sight of God; for it is unrea&s;onable to feed them that will not be ruled by you; they break the Obligation of Society by their di&s;orderly walking; for our Communion doth not &s;tand only in fre|quenting Meetings, and hearing Truth preached, but in an&s;wering the ble&s;&s;ed Principle of Truth, in Life and Conver&s;ation, and therein both the Rich and the Poor have Fellow&s;hip one with another.</P>
<P><PB N="608" REF="003104_0619_0FEFF8FBA473DD08">There is another Sort that are made poor by the Oppre&s;&s;ions and Cru|elties of others.

<P>And, <HI>My dear Friends,</HI> as God hath honoured you with &s;o high and holy a Calling, to be his Servants and Workmen in this his great and notable Day, and to work together in his Power, in &s;etting forth his Prai&s;e and Glory in the Earth, and gathering together in one the &s;cat|tered Seed in this and other Nations: Oh, let the Dignity of your Call|ing provoke and encourage you to be diligent Attenders upon his Work and Service you are called to, and let not your Concerns in the World draw you from ob&s;erving the Times and Sea&s;ons appointed to meet together; but you that are Elder, &s;et a good Example to the younger Sort, by a due Ob&s;ervation of the Hour appointed, that they that come fir&s;t one Time, may not by their long Staying for others be di&s;cou|raged, &s;o as perhaps they may be la&s;t another Time; but when the Time is come, leave your Bu&s;ine&s;s for the Lord's Work, and he will take Care your Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall not &s;uffer, but will add a Ble&s;&s;ing upon it, which will do more for you than the Time can do that may be &s;aved out of his Service.</P>
<P>And when ye have to do with perver&s;e, and froward or di&s;orderly Per&s;ons, whom ye have Occa&s;ion to reprove and to rebuke for the Truth's-&s;ake, and you find them &s;tout and high, and reflecting upon ye, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> is a Time for the Lamb's Meekne&s;s to &s;hine forth, and for you to feel your Authority in the Name of Chri&s;t to deal with &s;uch an one, and to wait for the pure and peaceable Wi&s;dom from above, to bring down and confound the earthly Wi&s;dom.

</LETTER>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing now by other Matters of this Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1691</NOTE> we &s;tep to the next, be|ing that of 1691,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of the Sickne&s;s, Death &amp; Cha|racter of <HI>G. Fox.</HI></NOTE> about the Beginning of which, <HI>G. Fox</HI> departed this Life, who even in the la&s;t Period thereof writ much, and continued la|borious without fainting. The la&s;t Epi&s;tle I find of his, was to his Friends and Brethren in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who becau&s;e of the Revolution and Troubles there, &s;uffered much, chiefly as I think by the Papi&s;ts; and therefore in the &s;aid Epi&s;tle he exhorted his Friends to Stedfa&s;tne&s;s: This was in the Month called <HI>January;</HI> and the next Day, being the fir&s;t of the Week, and the 11th of the &s;aid Month, he went to the Meeting at <HI>Grace-church-&s;treet,</HI> where he preached very effectually, treat|ing of many Things with great Power and Clearne&s;s; and concluded with a Prayer. After which, the Meeting ending, he went to <HI>Henry Gouldney</HI>'s in <HI>White-Hart-Court,</HI> near the Meeting-hou&s;e, where he &s;aid to &s;ome that came with him, <HI>He thought he felt the Cold &s;trike to his Heart, as he came out of the Meeting.</HI> Yet added, <HI>I am glad I was here. Now I am clear, I am fully clear.</HI> When tho&s;e Friends that were with him, were withdrawn, he lay down in his Clothes upon a Bed, but &s;oon ro&s;e again; yet after a little Time he lay down again, com|plaining &s;till of Cold; and his Strength decaying, he not long after undre&s;s'd, and went to Bed; where he lay in much Contentment and Re|&s;ignation, continuing very &s;en&s;ible to the la&s;t. His Di&s;temper increa&s;ing, and perhaps perceiving that his End was at Hand, he recommended the &s;preading of Books (containing the Doctrine of Truth) to &s;ome of his Friends, that came to him after having been &s;ent for. And to &s;ome others who came to vi&s;it him in his Illne&s;s, he &s;aid, <HI>All is well, the Seed of God reigns over all, and over Death it &s;elf. And tho'</HI> (continued he) <HI>I am weak in Body, yet the Power of God is over all, and the Seed reigns over all di&s;orderly Spirits.</HI> He u&s;ed often, even in his Preaching, when he &s;poke of Chri&s;t, to call him <HI>the Seed;</HI> wherefore tho&s;e that were with him, very well knew what he meant when he &s;poke of the Seed. Thus he lay in a heavenly Frame of Mind, and his Spirit being wholly exerci&s;ed towards the Lord, he grew weaker and weaker in Body, until on the third Day of the Week, and of his Sickne&s;s al&s;o, he piou&s;ly de|parted this Life. About four or five Hours before, being asked, <HI>How he
<PB N="610" REF="003104_0621_0FEFF8FE0050B040">did,</HI> he an&s;wered, <HI>Don't heed, The Power of the Lord is above all Sick|ne&s;s and Death; the Seed reigns, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord.</HI> And thus triumph|ing over Death, he departed from hence in Peace, and &s;lept &s;weetly on the 13th of the Month anciently called <HI>January,</HI> (for being as a Door or Entrance into the New Year) about ten a-clock at Night, in the 67th Year of his Age. His Body was buried near <HI>Bunhill-Fields</HI> on the 16th of the &s;aid Month, the Corps being accompanied by great Numbers of his Friends, and of other People al&s;o: For tho' he had had many Ene|mies, yet he had made him&s;elf al&s;o beloved of many. He was tall of Stature, and pretty big-bodied, yet very moderate in Meat and Drink; neither did he yield much to Sleep. He was a Man of a deep Under|&s;tanding, and of a di&s;cerning Spirit; and tho' his Words were not al|ways link'd together by a neat Grammatical Connexion, and that his Speech &s;ometimes &s;eemed abrupt, as with a kind of Gap; yet he ex|pre&s;s'd him&s;elf intelligently, and what was wanting in human Wi&s;dom, was abundantly &s;upplied with Heavenly Knowledge. He was of a quick Apprehen&s;ion; and tho' his Wit was not poli&s;hed by humane Arts, yet he was ingenious; and in his Prayers (which generally were not very long, tho' powerful) appeared a decent Gravity, mix'd with an awful Reverence, to Admiration. His Qualities are at large &s;et forth by <HI>Thomas Elwood,</HI> an eminent Author, who having much conver&s;ed with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character by <HI>T. Elwood.</HI></NOTE> gave the following Character of him. <Q>He was indeed an heavenly-minded Man, zealous for the Name of the Lord, and pre|fer'd the Honour of God before all Things. He was valiant for the Truth, bold in a&s;&s;erting it, patient in &s;uffering for it, unwearied in labouring in it, &s;teady in his Te&s;timony to it, immoveable as a Rock. Deep he was in divine Knowledge, clear in opening heavenly My&s;te|ries, plain and powerful in Preaching, fervent in Prayer. He was richly endued with Heavenly Wi&s;dom, quick in di&s;cerning, &s;ound in Judgment; able and ready in giving, di&s;creet in keeping Coun&s;el; a Lover of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, an Encourager of Virtue, Ju&s;tice, Tempe|rance, Meekne&s;s, Purity, Cha&s;tity, Mode&s;ty, Humility, Charity, and Self-denial in all, both by Word and Example. Graceful he was in Countenance, manly in Per&s;onage, grave in Ge&s;ture, courteous in Conver&s;ation, weighty in Communication, in&s;tructive in Di&s;cour&s;e, free from Affectation in Speech and Carriage. A &s;evere Reprover of hard and ob&s;tinate Sinners, a mild and gentle Admoni&s;her of &s;uch as were tender and &s;en&s;ible of their Failings. Not apt to re&s;ent Per|&s;onal Wrongs, ea&s;ie to forgive Injuries; but zealou&s;ly earne&s;t, where the Honour of God, the Pro&s;perity of Truth, the Peace of the Church were concerned. Very tender, compa&s;&s;ionate, and pitiful he was to all that were under any &s;ort of Affliction; full of brotherly Love, full of fatherly Care: For indeed the Care of the Churches of Chri&s;t was daily upon him, the Pro&s;perity and Peace whereof he &s;tudiou&s;ly &s;ought.</Q> Yet more is &s;aid of him to his Prai&s;e, both by the &s;aid <HI>Tho. Elwood</HI> and others; but I will not detain my Reader any longer therewith. His Wife, about &s;ix Months before his Death, came to him at <HI>London,</HI> and being glad of his Health, which then was bet|ter than &s;ome Time before, &s;he, after &s;ome Stay in the &s;aid City, re|turned Home well &s;atisfied, leaving him at <HI>London,</HI> where his general Service to the Church &s;eem'd to be then mo&s;t requi&s;ite. After his De|cea&s;e an Epi&s;tle was found, which was writ with his own Hand, and left &s;ealed up with this Super&s;cription, <HI>Not to be opened before the Time.</HI> What this &s;ignified, &s;eemed to be a Riddle; but he being now deceas'd, it was judged to be the Time to open this Letter, which was directed to his Friends, and was as followeth;</P>

<P>And now all Friends, all your Meetings, both Mens and Womens, Month|ly and Quarterly, and Yearly, &amp;c. were &s;et up by the Power, and Spirit, and Wi&s;dom of God; and in them you do know that you have felt both his Power, and Spirit, and Wi&s;dom, and ble&s;&s;ed refre&s;hing Pre&s;ence among you, and in you, to his Prai&s;e and Glory, and your Comfort: So that you have been a <HI>City &s;et on a Hill, that cannot be hid.</HI></P>
<P>And altho' many loo&s;e and unruly Spirits have ri&s;en betimes to op|po&s;e you and them, both in Print and otherways; but you have &s;een how they have come to nought; and the Lord hath bla&s;ted them, and brought their Deeds to Light, and made them manife&s;t to be the Trees without Fruit, and Wells without Water, and wandering Stars from the Firmament of God's Power, and the raging Waves of the Sea, ca&s;ting up their Mire and Dirt: And many of them are like the Dog turned to his old Vomit, and the Sow that was wa&s;hed, turned again to the Mire. And this hath been the Condition of many, God knoweth, and his People.</P>
<P>And therefore all &s;tand &s;tedfa&s;t in Chri&s;t Je&s;us your Head, in whom you are all one, Male and Female, and know his Government, and of the Encrea&s;e of his Government and Peace there &s;hall be no End; but there will be an End of the Devil's, and of all them that be out of Chri&s;t, and do oppo&s;e it and him, who&s;e Judgment doth not linger, and their Dam|nation doth not &s;lumber: And therefore in God and Chri&s;t's Light, Life, Spirit and Power live and walk, that is over all (and the Seed of it) in Love and in Innocency, and Simplicity; and in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holi|ne&s;s dwell, and in his Power and Holy Gho&s;t, in which God's Kingdom doth &s;tand.

<P>And as for this Spirit of Rebellion and Oppo&s;ition, that hath ri&s;en for|merly and lately, it is out of the Kingdom of God and heavenly <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> and is for Judgment and Condemnation, with all its Books, Words and Works. And therefore Friends are to live and walk in the Power and Spirit of God, that is over it, and in the Seed, that will brui&s;e and break it to pieces: In which Seed you have Joy and Peace with God, and Power and Authority to judge it; and your Unity is in the Power and Spirit of God, that doth judge it; and all God's Witne&s;&s;es in his Taber|nacle go out again&s;t it, and always have and will.</P>

He often al&s;o gave Proofs of an high &s;oaring Knowledge, and was very ready to &s;hew from Philo&s;ophy the Rea&s;ons and Cau&s;es of many Things in the Creation; but the Doc|trine of <HI>Francis Mercurius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who imbi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es the Notion of Tran&s;migration from <HI>Van Hel|mont.</HI></NOTE> Baron of <HI>Helmont,</HI> concerning the Tran&s;|migration of Souls, became &s;o Palatable to him, that he not only in &s;ome Manner approved it, but al&s;o was believed to be concerned in the Book containing two hundred Queries about that Matter, great Part of which, as I have been informed, he acknowledged to have been put in Writing by him&s;elf, tho' it appeared in Publick without the Author's Name. But this Notion meeting with no Acceptance among the <HI>Qua|kers,</HI> his Love to them began to abate, and his Di&s;content increa&s;ed, becau&s;e two Per&s;ons, who oppo&s;ed him, had, (as he &s;aid) u&s;ed &s;ome un|warrantable

<HEAD>A brief Repre&s;entation of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Ca&s;e of not Swearing; and why they might have been, and yet may be relieved therein, by <HI>PAR|LIAMENT.</HI></HEAD>
<P>'TIS a certain Truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thereupon <HI>T. Eccle&s;tone</HI> in their Behalf, gives the Mem|bers of Parlia|ment a Repre|&s;entation of their Ca&s;e.</NOTE> that among Chri&s;tians, and Prote&s;tants e&s;pe|cially, there are divers particular Things about Religion, con|&s;cienciou&s;ly &s;crupled by &s;ome as unlawful, that others e&s;teem ortho|dox: And therefore it is not to be wondered, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> differ from many others (tho' not from all) in this Ca&s;e of Oaths; they be|lieving they are ab&s;olutely forbid to &s;wear in any Ca&s;e, by that po|&s;itive Command of Chri&s;t, <HI>Mat.</HI> v. 44. and the earne&s;t Exhortation of his Apo&s;tle, <HI>James</HI> v. 12. And that this is undeniably their Chri&s;|tian Per&s;ua&s;ion, is evidenced by their Sufferings the&s;e many Years for not Swearing.</P>
<P>And therefore their Ca&s;e may be worth the charitable Notice of the Government, by Law to relieve them therein; and not for their reli|gious Per&s;ua&s;ion, to continue them and their Families expo&s;ed to Ruin, who among their Neighbours chearfully pay to the Support of the Government, and by their Trades and Indu&s;try (according to their Capacities) advance the national Stock.</P>
<P>It may therefore be humbly offered, That 'tis not the Intere&s;t of the Government to refu&s;e them Relief.</P>
<P>Their Indu&s;try in Trade, both at Sea and Land, bringing Profit to the Government, as well as others; the Station they &s;tand in, as Mer|chants, Farmers, Manufactors, Improvers of Lands and Stocks, is ad|vantageous to their Neighbours as truly as others. And as it &s;eems not the Intere&s;t of the Government in general, that they &s;hould be any Ways di&s;couraged in their hone&s;t Indu&s;try; &s;o neither is it the In|tere&s;t of an eminent Part of the Government, that they &s;hould not be relieved, <HI>viz.</HI>
due Judges.</P>
<P>For the frequent Suits that are brought again&s;t the <HI>Quakers,</HI> before the Chancery and Exchequer Judges, are no do doubt very trouble&s;ome and burden&s;ome, by the Difficulty of getting at a ju&s;t I&s;&s;ue, for Want of Swearing; whereby Justice is delayed, and their Cau&s;es often held very long; and no doubt when ju&s;t Judges &s;ee the <HI>Quakers</HI> wrong'd, and abu&s;ed, and can't relieve them, 'tis irk&s;ome to them: So that 'tis humbly conceiv'd, 'twould be a great Ea&s;e to tho&s;e Courts, to have the <HI>Quakers</HI> reliev'd in this Ca&s;e of Oaths.</P>
<P>Neither is it without Advantage to the King's other Courts, to be able to u&s;e the Evidence of one who is now a <HI>Quaker,</HI> that perhaps
<PB N="624" REF="003104_0635_0FEFF912FA403B40">was not &s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1694</NOTE> &s;ame Years ago; when he was a Witne&s;s to a Bill, Bond, Book-debt, or Deed of Indenture; or when he was Steward, or Tru|&s;tee, or Servant, either to Per&s;ons of Quality, or to others of Trade, or E&s;tate.</P>
<P>Nor may their Te&s;timony be unu&s;eful to Coroners, in Ca&s;e of un|natural Deaths; nor inconvenient in Ca&s;es of Tre&s;pa&s;s or Felony, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And it is farther propo&s;ed, That it is not the Intere&s;t of the Sub|ject to continue them unrelieved: For it is not the Intere&s;t of tho&s;e the <HI>Quakers</HI> are indebted to; becau&s;e, tho' &s;uch may &s;ue and harra&s;s the <HI>Quakers</HI> in Per&s;on and E&s;tate, yet they may long want a Deci&s;
on of their Debt or Claim, as to the Right of it, for Want of an An&s;wer upon Oath.</P>
<P>It is not the Intere&s;t of tho&s;e they are concerned with, in any doubtful Ca&s;e, becau&s;e of the Difficulty to come to Trial.</P>
<P>And for tho&s;e that owe Money to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> to be allowed to fly into Chancery for a Refuge, to ob&s;truct paying ju&s;t Debts, is &s;uch an Injury, as 'tis hop'd, no one that is rational will countenance, or de|&s;ire &s;hould be continued upon them. And may it nor then be a&s;&s;erted, that 'tis no hone&s;t Man's true and ju&s;t Intere&s;t, (to have the <HI>Quakers</HI> denied Relief) no not the Gown-men of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> who&s;e few Fees from the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as Plaintiffs might &s;ugge&s;t (tho' unduly) that they have no long tail'd Debts to &s;ue for, nor Titles to recover; but if they &s;o &s;uppo&s;e, it's a Mi&s;take, for 'tis rather their De&s;pair or Re|lief, and their well-known Inability to pur&s;ue a Cau&s;e, that is their common determent to begin.</P>
<P>So that of all Cau&s;es that croud tho&s;e Courts, few are brought by the <HI>Quakers,</HI> tho' they may need it as much as others, to the great Lo&s;s of the Learned in the Law, as well as the poor injured <HI>Quaker.</HI></P>
<P>And one might think 'twere great Pity an indu&s;trious People &s;hould be kept liable to all injurious Suits, and &s;o much barr'd from Suing for their Rights, be their Cau&s;e never &s;o rea&s;onable, ju&s;t or nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Seeing their Relief is to them &s;o needful, &s;o harmle&s;s to all, and &s;o u&s;eful to the Government, and their Neighbours; let's a little con|&s;ider the common Objections, which may be &s;um'd up in &s;hort thus:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Fir&s;t Objection, <HI>How &s;hall we then be at a Certainty?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, <HI>Why &s;hould the Laws be alter'd for them? For,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, <HI>'Twould be to raze old Foundations.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Fourthly, <HI>And let them into the Government.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Which it's hoped will not be difficult to an&s;wer one by one, and that to rea&s;onable Satisfaction.</P>
<P>And to the fir&s;t, <HI>viz. The Doubt of Certainty.</HI> It may be rationally affirmed, That who&s;oever is bound to tell the Truth, (e&s;pecially again&s;t Mens own Intere&s;t, where the Temptation, if any, mainly lies) &s;uch are either &s;o bound by the Law of God, or the Laws of Men, or both.</P>
<P>Now the Obligations by the Law of God are binding on good Men, whether they give An&s;wers on Oath, or on their &s;olemn Affirmation in the Fear of God; and Knaves are only bound by the penal Laws of Men; which if made equally &s;evere, to tho&s;e that give fallacious An|&s;wers, as well without Oath as by Oath, would be equally effectual and binding, both to them that give An&s;wers without Swearing, and to them that Swear.</P>
<P>The Second Objection, <HI>That 'twould be an Alteration of the Law;</HI> Not of the Sub&s;tance; of the Law, but of a Circum&s;tance; and if that hath no Detriment in it, but that the Alteration be really an Amend|ment, and a Conveniency to an hone&s;t, indu&s;trious People, pray why &s;hould it not be done? What Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament is there, that
<PB N="625" REF="003104_0636_0FEFF95590DB2F80">pa&s;&s;es, but &s;ome Law or other is made for the Ea&s;e, Security, or Re|lief of the Subject?</P>
<P>If Foreigners are too hard for our &s;ea-faring People, out goes an Act of Navigation to prevent it.</P>
<P>If our Poor at home want Silk to work with, how &s;oon is it granted? (notwith&s;tanding the &s;ame Act) to come over Land, and not directly in Shipping from the Places of its Produce, as the &s;aid Act before did enjoin: And &s;hall the Ea&s;e of Trade be &s;o &s;oon granted again&s;t a po|&s;itive Statute; and the Ea&s;e of Con&s;cience be &s;o long denied in this, as po&s;itive a Command of Chri&s;t, at lea&s;t really &s;o believed and accepted?</P>
<P>And for the Third Objection, <HI>That 'tis to raze old Foundations.</HI> An|&s;wer, <HI>No,</HI> as 'twas &s;aid, 'tis rather to mend them; a proper Work for Parliaments.</P>
<P>Did not Parliaments abrogate Popery, with all its Claim of Anti|quity? Did not a Parliament make the Act of <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> again&s;t the Claim of Prerogative? And was it more rea&s;onable to &s;ecure the Subject from perpetual Impri&s;onment by a King, without Trial, than it is to &s;ecure one Subject from impri&s;oning another till Death, for not giving an An&s;wer in Chancery, or Exchequer, upon Oath? Does it be|long to Parliaments to &s;ecure other Subjects in their E&s;tates, Liberties, and Properties? And is it unparliamentary, to &s;ecure the <HI>Quakers</HI> from Seque&s;trations again&s;t their whole E&s;tates? becau&s;e they dare not com|ply to a Circum&s;tance of the Law, when (as they under&s;tand it) 'tis again&s;t an expre&s;s Command of Chri&s;t? Surely no: And therefore their Relief in Parliament is a &s;itting Ca&s;e to be there tenderly taken Notice of, and provided for.</P>
<P>May it not then be well worth the While for this pre&s;ent Parliament, to relieve the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People, and afford their &s;uffering Ca&s;e Re|dre&s;s? That thereby their Cau&s;es may the &s;ooner come to an I&s;&s;ue; whether they &s;ue for ju&s;t Debts, or are &s;ued; whereby many unju&s;t and vexatious Suits, by injurious and litigious Per&s;ons, may be pre|vented, which have often tended rather to the <HI>Quakers</HI> Ruin, and o|thers Damage, than Recovery of their Right.</P>
<P>As to the Fourth Objection, <HI>That 'twill tend to let them into the Government:</HI> For An&s;wer thereto, Bar that as hard as you plea&s;e; only don't let the Suppo&s;al of that, from which &s;o ea&s;ily and &s;o wil|lingly they may be excluded, be a Hindrance to that Ea&s;e and Benefit the Government may &s;o ea&s;ily afford them.</P>
<P>But now while you have Opportunity by the Station Providence hath placed you in, pray be you of &s;uch noble, generous Spirits, as to re|lieve them, tho' they differ from you in the Con&s;truction of a Text they e&s;teem plain and po&s;itive on their Side, and from which they dare not &s;werve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chry&s;o&s;tom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Swinder|by<HI>'s Appeal to the King.</HI></NOTE> having therein the Concurrence of many ancient Fathers, and Martyrs, and &s;ince them the <HI>Menni&s;ts,</HI> and of late <HI>Francis Osbourne,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in his <HI>Political Reflections,</HI> 7th Edition, p. 319. who treating of Judicial Ca&s;es, calls <HI>Not &s;wearing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Walter Brute</HI>'s Decla|ration Act, &amp; Monuments, <HI>Vol. I. 570</HI>new Edition <HI>Young</HI>'s Fir&s;t Exam. fol. 910. old Edition; with abundance others.</NOTE> a yielding a &s;incere and faithful Obedience to the Precept of our Saviour, <HI>Swear not at all,</HI> (which [&s;ays he] the corrupt Glo&s;&s;es of Expo&s;itors labour much, tho' all in vain, to clude.)</P>
<P>And <HI>Swinderby,</HI> in his Appeal to the King, complaining of the Er|rors of the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> &s;ays thus, <HI>As Chri&s;t forbids Swearing, &s;o</HI> [&s;ays he] <HI>the Pope ju&s;tifieth Swearing, and compels Men to Swear.</HI></P>
<P>Which no Man can rationally &s;ay, is only &s;poken of Swearing in Communication, for his Complaint is again&s;t ju&s;tifying Swearing, and compelling Men to Swear, which cannot be pretended to mean other than &s;olemn Swearing; for no Age, that we read of, did ever autho|rize profane Swearing, much le&s;s compel to it.</P>
<P><PB N="626" REF="003104_0637_0FEFF91527435C70">Since therefore not only profane Swearing, but al&s;o &s;olemn Swearing was early complained of by Prote&s;tants, let it not &s;eem &s;trange to any, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> now &s;cruple Swearing, and for Ea&s;e therein have often &s;ought Relief in Parliament, the proper Place.</P>
<P>Seeing then they believe they have the Authority of Chri&s;t's Com|mand, and the Apo&s;tle's Exhortation, and the Martyrs Doctrine on their Side; tho' divers of you, are not &s;o per&s;uaded;</P>
<P>Yet let the World behold your Ju&s;tice and Willingne&s;s (according to your Power) to do Good to all the hone&s;t and indu&s;trious People you both repre&s;ent and govern; by enacting, <HI>That their Solemn Affirmation &s;hall be accepted in Lieu of an Oath; and all that fal&s;ify therein, &s;hall be puni&s;hed equally with perjured Per&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>It having been made appear to a Committee of this Parliament, [<HI>Dec.</HI> 2. 1692] that they are expo&s;ed to great Hard&s;hips, as afore&s;aid; and not them&s;elves only, but others al&s;o; [which was the Ca&s;e of a Member, or two of this pre&s;ent Parliament.]</P>
<P>So that upon the whole Matter, the &s;aid Committee were of Opi|nion, and did report it to the Hou&s;e, <HI>That the Quakers ought to be relieved according to the Prayer of their Petition,</HI> [then newly pre&s;ent|ed to the Hou&s;e.]</P>

But the <HI>Quakers</HI> did not think Per&s;ons might not have got together, and cau&s;ed a dangerous Di&s;turb-ance. And therefore they declined to appear there, and gave the following Rea&s;ons of their Refu&s;al, which were read in the appointed Meeting, and afterwards publi&s;hed in Print.</P>

<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e the &s;aid <HI>G.

<P N="2">2. We decline to meet, becau&s;e it is not an agreed Meeting on both Sides, which it ought to have been; and where that is not, or can-not be adju&s;ted; the Pre&s;s is the next &s;air Way and Expedient, which he has begun with, and now &s;eems to decline; nor hath he &s;ent us a Copy of his Charge or Indictment again&s;t us, which al&s;o he ought to have done.</P>
<P N="3">3. That he has two of our Books which lie hard at his Door; in Vindication of us and our Doctrines from his Exceptions, and which he has not yet an&s;wered; &s;o that he is not upon equal Terms with us; and therefore we think his Challenge, <HI>Appointment</HI> and <HI>Sumnous</HI> un&s;air; and that all that are not partial will be of the &s;ame Mind with us.</P>
<P N="4">4. Such <HI>publick</HI> and <HI>unlimited</HI> Meetings are too often attended with Heats, <HI>Levity</HI> and <HI>Confu&s;ion,</HI> and an&s;wer not the End, de&s;ired by &s;ober and enquiring Men. Be&s;ides, that it lets up a Practice that Autho|rity may judge to be an <HI>Abu&s;e</HI> to our Liberty and &s;o draw that un|der Re&s;iectoin as no Friend to the Civil Peace.</P>

<P N="6">6.

<P>The&s;e Rea&s;ons the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as hath been &s;aid, publi&s;hed in Print, to &s;hew the World, that it was not without a weighty Cau&s;e, that they did not accept <HI>G.

Keith</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf thus di&s;appointed in his Intention, took upon him for all that, to defend his Charge in the Ab&s;ence of his Adver&s;aries, which now he could do ea&s;ily, &s;ince none con|tradicted him, and he was applauded by the frequent Shoutings of the Mob that was there in great Numbers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which he oh-jects to very &s;rieclou&s;ly</NOTE> After the Rea&s;ons of Nonap pearance were read, Keith &s;ignified that they were not &s;atisfactory, by calling them &s;lender, weak and frivolous.<HI>What,</HI> &s;aid he, may a Male factor make this Excu&s;e, <HI>You &s;hall not call me before a Ju&s;tice without my Con&s;ent?

But who would formerly ever have thought that &s;uch a little Man as he was, would have been &s;o big. It look'd ju&s;t as if the <HI>Quakers</HI> were obliged to appear as Malefactors before the pretended Judge <HI>Keith,</HI> ac companied with his A&s;&s;i&s;tants the Mob, and I don't know who.

<P>My Limits do not admit of a circum&s;tan&s;tial Relation of what was tran&s;acted at that Time in <HI>Turnvers-Hall;</HI> yet to &s;hew brie&s;ly how he treated Matters, I'll produce one or two In&s;tancen, by which my Reader

may know, <HI>ut ex unguc Leonem,</HI> and &s;o judge of the re&s;t. He &s;aid, he would charge the <HI>Quakers</HI> with nothing but what he could prove from their own Writings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His abu&s;ive Perver&s;ion of G. W's Wri|tings</NOTE> and he went on thus:<HI>I offer to prove</HI> that G. White|head <HI>hath denied Chri&s;t both to be God and Man.</HI> A &s;trange Thing in deed, &s;ince it was very well known that <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> had publi&s;hed a Book of above twenty Sheets, under this Title, <HI>The</HI> DIVINITY of CHRIST, <HI>and Unity of the Three that bear Record in Heaven, with the ble&s;&s;ed End and Effect of Chri&s;t's Appearance coming in the Fle&s;h, Suffer|ings and Sacrifice for Sinners, confe&s;&s;ed and vindicated by his Followers called</HI> Quakers. This Book <HI>G, Keith</HI> could not pretend Ignorance of, for he pick'd &s;omewhat out of it an his Narrative. But to maintain his Charge, he appeal'd to a Book of <HI>G. Whitehead</HI>'s called, <HI>The Light and Life of Chri&s;t within.</HI> This Book <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> had written in An&s;wer to <HI>W. Burnet,</HI> a <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> Preacher, who writing of Chri&s;t &s;aid, <HI>As he was God, he was Co-Creator with the Father, and &s;o was'before</HI> Abraham, <HI>and had Glory with God before the world was, and in this Sen&s;e came down from Heaven.</HI> To which <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> an&s;wered, <HI>What Nou&s;en&s;e and un&s;cripture-like Language is this, to tell of God being Co-Creator with the Father? Or that God had Glory with God? Doth not this imply two Gods, and that God had a Father? Let the Reader judge.</HI> Certainly it appcar&s; from this plainly, that <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> did not intend any thing el&s;e but to cen&s;ure the un&s;eriptural Expre&s;&s;ions of his Antagoni&s;t, as <HI>Co-Creator,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. iii. 20. John x. 30</NOTE> and implying two Gods: For not only the Apo&s;tle faith, <HI>God is one,</HI> but Chri&s;t him&s;elf faith, <HI>I and the Father are one.</HI> Yet <HI>G. Keith</HI> did not &s;tick to &s;ay, G. Whitehead <HI>denieth the Divinity of Chri&s;t, and he deceives the Nation and theParliament, by telling them, The Quakers own Chri&s;t to be both God and Man, and-believe all that is recorded of him in the Holy Scripture.</HI> This he &s;trove to prove from a Pa&s;&s;age taken out of the aforementioned Book, which in Sen&s;e agreed with the former; and &s;peaking in another Page of the &s;ame Matter, viz. <HI>The</HI> Bapti&s;ts <HI>calling God the Word, Co-Creator with the Father. G.Whitehead</HI> an&s;wers thus to it, <HI>To tell of the Word God, Co-Creator with the Father, is all one as to tell of God being Co-Creator with God, if the Father be God', and this is to make two Gods and two Creators: For God Co-Creator with the Father plainly implies two.</HI> Was this &s;hewing of others their ab&s;urd Expre&s;&s;ions, a Denial that Chri&s;t was God, as <HI>Keith</HI> would have it? Might it not be asked here, whether the acute Wit of <HI>Keith</HI> was now altogether flown away? But a great; Part of his Auditory con&s;i&s;ted of an ignorant Crew, and one or other of them was continually heard to cry out, <HI>It is &s;ufficient.</HI></P>
<P>Now to prove that <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> had denied <HI>Chri&s;t to be Man, Keith</HI> cited from the forementioned Book, called, <HI>The Divinity of Chri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. the&s;e Words, <HI>If the Body and Soul of the Son of God were both created, doth not this render him a fourth Per&s;on?</HI> Here <HI>Keith</HI> &s;topt, and broke off with an &amp;c. without adding the following Words; <HI>For Creation was in Time, which contradicts the Doctrine of three di&s;tinct, uncreated, Co-eter|nal, Co-e&s;&s;ential Per&s;ons in the Deity, &s;ecing that which was ere 'ted, was not &s;o.</HI> This <HI>G.

But <HI>Keith</HI> went on reading from <HI>G. Whitehead</HI>'s Book, thus, <HI>Where doth the Scripture &s;ay, That his Soul was created? For was not he the Bright|ue&s;s of the Father's Glory, and the expre&s;s Image of his divine Sub&s;tance. But &s;uppo&s;ing the Soul of Chri&s;t was with the Body created in Time, &amp;c.</HI> Here <HI>Keith</HI> broke off again, omitting the following Words; <HI>I ask, if from Eternity he was a Per&s;on di&s;tinct from God and his holy Spirit, without either Soul or Body? Where doth the Scripture &s;peak of any Per&s;on with|out either Soul or Body? Let's have plain Scripture.</HI></P>

<P>But now he had a temporal Reward in his View; and &s;eeing for that End he began more and more to declare him&s;elf in Favour of the Epi&s;co|pal Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W.

<P>And whereas we the &s;aid People are required to &s;ign the &s;aid A&s;&s;o|ciation, we &s;incerely declare, that our refu&s;ing &s;o to do, is not out of any Di&s;affection to the King or Government, nor in Oppo&s;ition to his being declared right&s;ul and law&s;ul King of the&s;e Realms, but purely becau&s;e we cannot for Con&s;cience-&s;ake fight, kill, or revenge, either for our &s;elves, or any Man el&s;e.</P>
<P>And we believe that the timely Di&s;covery and Prevention of the late barbarous De&s;ign, and mi&s;chievous Plot again&s;t the King and Go|vernment, and the &s;ad Effects it might have had, is an eminent Mer|cy from Almighty God; for which we, and the whole Nation, have great Cau&s;e to be humbly thankful to him, and to pray for the Con|tinuance of his Mercies to them and us.</P>

<P>In this Year died of a Fever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of <HI>R.

He had been in Holland the Year before, in which Time I had more than once Opportunity to &s;peak with him privately, and di&s;covered thereby &s;uch Chri&s;tian Qualities in him, that were indeed excellent; and therefore the News of his Decea&s;e did much affect me; and becau&s;e of his Mini&s;try, in which he was eminent, being more than ordinary full of Matter in his Preaching, his Death was much lamented among tho&s;e Churches in <HI>England</HI> where he had laboured mo&s;t in the Go&s;pel. His Wife <HI>Eleanor</HI> in her Te&s;timony concerning him &s;aid, My Spirit hath been, and is bowed under, a deep Sen&s;e of my great Lo&s;s and Exerci&s;e in the Removal of my dear Husband, when it hath plea&s;ed God in his Wi&s;dom to take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> me

who was Comfort to my Life, and Joy to my Days in this world, being given me of God, in great Mercy and loving Kindne&s;s; and &s;o he hath been en joyed by me in Thankfulne&s;s of Heart, to the Clo&s;e of that Time God had appointed and now is taken from the Worlds with all its Troubles and Excrei&s;es, as al&s;o from all his labours and 'Travels, which were great among&s;t the Churches of Chri&s;t, which with me have no &s;mall Lo&s;s in his Removal. But what &s;hall &s;ay? Wi&s;e and good is the Lord, who doth what he will in Heaven and in Earth, and among&s;t his Churches and his Cho&s;en.

After a Description of his Life, and his many Travels in the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel, to edi&s;y and build up the Churches, the &s;aith al&s;o, That <HI>Tho' his Love to her was above all vi|&s;ibles,</HI> as the be&s;t of Enjoyments he had in this World, yet &s;he was not too "dear to him to give up to &s;erve the Truth of God. I was made (&s;aith the) a Ble&s;&s;ing to him, more comfortable every Day than other: He would often expre&s;s it; and truly &s;o was he to me every Day, every Way, and in every Re&s;pect. No Tongue or Pen can relate the Full of that Comfort and Joy we had in God, and one in another. Tet we find &s;uch hath been the Plea&s;ure of 'God concerning them he hath loved, to try them in the mo&s;t near and dear Enjoyments, that it might be manife&s;t he was loved ahovt, all; that no Gifts may be pre&s;erved above the Giver; but that he may be all in all, who is, and is to come, God ble&s;&s;ed for ever and ever. And truly there hath been great Care and Watch&s;ulue&s;s one over another, and over our own Spirits, to &s;ee that our Love, tho' great, was bounded and kept within its Compa&s;s, the Truth being its Original, the Alpha and Omega al&s;o. Altho' it hath been the Plea&s;ure of God to try me, in the Removal of &s;o great a Ble&s;|&s;ing from me, &s;ure it is,, that I may be the more inward to him, and have his Love always in my Remembrance, who gives and takes away, and in till ble&s;s his Name. My Soul travels that I may always follow his Foot&s;teps of Self-Denial in all Things, that 1 may fini&s;h my Cour&s;e in this World, to the Glory of God, as he did, and have my Part in that Man&s;ion of Glo|y with him eternal in the Heavens; tho' it may be my Lot to pay for a Time in this World of Troubles; yet I have Hope in Immortality and Eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, when Time in this World &s;hall be no more. <HI>Thus Hie writ: But to &s;hun Prolixity,, I break off.

<HEAD>Some CONSIDERATIONS humbly offered by the Peo|ple called <HI>QUAKERS,</HI> relating to the Bill for re&s;training the Licenciou&s;ne&s;s of the Pre&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Bill is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill for re&s;training the Pre&s;s d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pt.</NOTE> They conceive, of like Nature with the expired Act 13 <HI>&amp;</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 33. And many Inconveniences did attend the Subjects by it whil&s;t in Force, by which the &s;aid People were Sufferers.</P>
<P>To prevent the Printing and publi&s;hing of Seditious or Trea&s;onable Books again&s;t the Government, and Scandalous Pamphlets tending to Vice and Immorality, is the wi&s;dom of all good Governments, and mu&s;t be the De&s;ire of all good Men.</P>
<P>But to Limit Religious Books to a Licen&s;e, where the Tolerated Per|&s;ua&s;ions are many, they conceive, &s;eems altogether un&s;afe to all, but that who&s;e Opinion the Licen&s;er is of, who by this Bill hath Power to allow what he &s;hall judge Sound and Orthodox, or reject what he &s;hall con&s;true to be either Heretical, Seditious, or Offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory and Experience have taught how the ob&s;cure Term of Here&s;y hath been turned and &s;tretched again&s;t Primitive Chri&s;tians, Martyrs, and famous Reformers: Nor is it forgotten for what Reafons the Writ <HI>De Haeretico Comburendo</HI> was aboli&s;hed.</P>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">29 Car 2. cap. 9.</NOTE>
<P>'Tis no &s;trange Thing to have Learned<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">See Dr. <HI>South</HI> and Dr. <HI>Sherlock.</HI></NOTE> Men of the &s;ame Church inter|fere in their Opinions concerning &s;everal Texts of Holy Scripture; and 'tis uncertain when their Opinions come to the Licen&s;er, whether the World &s;hall have the be&s;t or no.</P>
<P>The different Apprchen&s;ions Men have of divers Parts of Scripture, gives Birth to different Per&s;ua&s;ions, who yet all make the Scripture the Te&s;t thereof; which by the Kindne&s;s of the Government being Tolerated, they conceive, they ought to be left free to defend them, from the Mi&s;re|pre&s;entations, Prejudice, or Mi&s;take of others, without being &s;ubjetcted to the Cen&s;ure of a Licen&s;er of a different Per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>They therefore humbly hope, That nothing may be Enacted that will le&s;&s;en the Toleration, which they thankfully enjoy under the Favour of this, as well as the late Government.</P>

<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations, with what others were offered, were of &s;uch Effect, that the Bill drop'd.</P>
<P>About this Time the Writings of <HI>Antonia Bourignon</HI> were not only tran&s;lated into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

To this he added Relations of &s;everal Things that hap|pen'd, as he &s;aid, among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> whereas &s;ome of the&s;e were fictitious, and meer Untruths. He al&s;o raked up Things that never had been approved by the <HI>Quakers;</HI> as the Ca&s;e of <HI>James Navlor,</HI> de|&s;cribed here before in its due Place; notwith&s;tanding the &s;aid <HI>J.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Children,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Mu&s;t leave you in a wicked Age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Advice to his Children and Grandchildren.</NOTE> but commend you to the Mea|&s;ure of the Grace of God in your inward Parts, which you have received by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and as you love it, and mind the Teach|ings of it, you will find it a Coun&s;ellor to in&s;truct you in the Way everla&s;ting, and pre&s;erve you out of the Ways of the Ungodly.</P>
<P>I have &s;een much in my Days, and I always ob&s;erved, that the Fear of the Lord God proved the be&s;t Portion, and tho&s;e that walked in it were the only happy People, both in this Life (while they continued faithful) and when they come to die, tho' they meet with many Hard&s;hips in their Pa&s;&s;age. By Experience I can &s;peak it, That the Ways of Holine&s;s afford more true Comfort and Peace to the up|right Soul, than the greate&s;t Plea&s;ures this World can afford; the former reaches the Heart and Soul, while the Delights of this World are but a Shew, and Appearance only, vani&s;hing like a Dream; and whoever believes otherwi&s;e of them, will certainly find them to be but lying Vanities; therefore the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Rom.</HI> vi. 21. might boldly put the Que&s;tion to the converted <HI>Romans,</HI> (viz.) <HI>What Fruit had you then in tho&s;e Things whereof you are now a&s;hamed?

Light will manife&s;t the Stirrings of it after God, which I felt from my tende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Years; altho' I under&s;tood them not &s;o plainly, till I heard the Truth declared.</P>
<P>I advi&s;e you to keep a pure Con&s;cience, both towards God and Man; for if that be de&s;iled, Hypocri&s;y and Formality will deprive you of all comfortable Feeling of God's Pre&s;ence; and then Dead|ne&s;s and Dryne&s;s will be your mi&s;erable Portion.</P>
<P>Be careful how you &s;pend your precious Time, for an Account mu&s;t be given of every idle Word, tho' but few regard it; but fooli&s;h je&s;t|ing, and vain Talking are &s;aid to grieve the Spirit of God; read <HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 30. But improve your Time in Prayer, and Religious Exer|ci&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and be diligent in your lawful Callings; for <HI>The De&s;ire of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">othful Man killeth him,</HI> Prov. xxi. 25.</P>
<P>Be careful what Company you frequent; for a Man is commonly known by the Company he keeps, as much as by any one outward Thing; and of your Behaviour in Company; for I have found that a wife and &s;ober Deportment, adds much to a Man's Reputation and Credit in the World.</P>
<P>Watch to the Light, and its Di&s;coveries of Good and Evil, that you may not be ignorant of Satan's Devices; &s;o the Net will be &s;pread in vain in the Sight of the Bird; for Watchfulne&s;s will make you in Love with a retired E&s;tate; and the more truly and perfectly any Man knows and under&s;tands him&s;elf, the better di&s;cerning will &s;uch have of other Men; as in the Beginning, when deep Silence of all Fle&s;h was more in U&s;e, the Spirit of di&s;cerning was more common, and quicker, than &s;ince it hath been neglected; therefore be &s;ure you &s;pend &s;ome Time (at convenient Sea&s;ons) in waiting upon God in Silence, tho' it be di&s;plea&s;ing to the Fle&s;h; for I have had more Comfort, and Confirmation in the Truth, in my inward retiring in Silence, than from all Words I have heard from others, tho' I have often been re|fre&s;hed by them al&s;o.</P>

By their powerful Way of Preaching Repentance many were awakened out of the Sleep of carede&s;s Security, and came to &s;ee that their Covering was too &s;hort, and that they were not clothed with the true Wedding-Garment: And many that had been of a rude Life, came to be &s;o touched to the Heart by the&s;e zealous Preachers, that crying out, <HI>What &s;hall we do to he &s;aved?</HI> they were brought to Re|pentance, and Conver&s;ion; and &s;o from wild and rough, came to be &s;edate and &s;ober.

cannot but &s;ay, that the Lord was good unto me, did vi&s;it me, did teach me, did help we, did te&s;tify his Acceptance of me many Times, to the re|fre&s;hing and Joy of my Heart before him.</P>
<P>But my Soul was not &s;atisfied with what I met with, nor indeed could be, there being further quickuings and pre&s;&s;ings in my Spirit, after a more full, certain and &s;atisfaclory Knowledge; even after the Sen&s;e,, Sight and Enjoyment of God, as was te&s;tified in the Scriptures, to have been felt and enjoyed in the former Times: For J &s;aw plainly, that there was a Stop of the Streams, and a great Falling-hort of the Power, Life and Glory which they partoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of. We had not &s;o the Spirit, nor wers &s;o in the Faith, nor did &s;o walk and live in God, as they did. They were come to <HI>Mount</HI> Sion <HI>and the heavenly</HI> Jeru&s;alem, &amp;c. which we had hardly &s;o much as the literal Knowledge or Apprehen&s;ion what they were. So that I &s;aw the whole Cour&s;e of Religion among us, was (for the mo&s;t part) but a Talk to what they felt, enjoyed, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and lived in.</P>
<P>This Sen&s;e made me &s;ick at Heart indeed, and &s;et me upon deep crying to God, clo&s;e &s;earching the Scriptures, and waiting on God, that I might receive the pure Sen&s;e and Under&s;tanding of them, from and in the Light, and by the Help of his Spirit. (And what the Lord did be&s;low on me in that State, with Thankfulne&s;s I remember before him at this very Day: For he was then my God and a Pitier and a Watcher over me; tho' he had not plea&s;ed then to direct me, how to &s;tay my Mind upon him and a|bide with him.) And then I was led, (indeed I was led, I did not run of my &s;elf) into a way of Separation from the Wor&s;hip of the World, into a gathered Society: For this both the Scripture and the Spirit of God in me gave Te&s;timony unto; and what we then met with, and what Leadings and Help we then felt, there is a Remembrance and Te&s;timony in my Heart to this Day. But there was &s;omewhat wanting, and we mu&s;took our Way: For whereas we &s;hould have pre&s;&s;ed forward into the Spirit and Power, we can too much outward into Letter and Form: And tho' the Lord in many Things helped us, yet therein he was again&s;t us, and brought Darkne&s;s, Confu&s;ion and Scattering upon us. I was &s;orely broken and darkned, and in this darkned State, &s;ometimes lay &s;till for a long Sea&s;on, &s;ecretly mourning and crying out to the Lord Night and Day; &s;ometimes I ran a|bout, bearkning after what might apped<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or break forth in others, but ne|ver met with any Thing, whereto there was the lea&s;t An&s;wer in my Heart, &s;ave in one People, who had a Touch of Truth: But I never expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much to any of them, nor indeed felt them at all able to reach my Con|dition.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, after all my Di&s;ire&s;&s;es, Wandarings and &s;ore Travels, I met with &s;ome Writings of this People called Quakers, which I ca&s;t a &s;light Eye up|on and di&s;dained, as falling very &s;hort of that Wi&s;dom, Light, Life and Power, which I had been longing for and &s;earching after: I had like wi&s;e (&s;ome pretty Di&s;tance of Time after this) Opportunity of meeting with &s;ame of them, and divers of them were by the Lord moved (I know it to be &s;o &s;ince) to come to me: As I remember, at the very fir&s;t they reached to the Life of God in me, which Life an&s;wered their voice, and cau&s;ed a great Love in me to &s;pring to them: But &s;till in my Rea&s;onings with them, and Di&s;putes alone (in my Mind) concerning them, I was very far off from owning them, as &s;o knowing the Lord, or &s;o appearing in his Life and Power as my Condition needed, and as my Soul waited for. Yea, the more I conver&s;ed with them, the more I &s;eemed in my Under&s;tanding and Rea&s;on to get over them, and to trample them under my Feet, as a poor, weak, &s;illy, contemptible Generation, who had &s;ome Smatterings of Truth in them, and &s;ome hone&s;t De&s;ires towards God, but very far off from the clear and full Under&s;tanding of his Way and Will. And this was the Effict almo&s;t of e|vrey Di&s;cour&s;e with them, they &s;till reached my Heart, and I felt then in
<PB N="650" REF="003104_0661_0FEFF9BC34737998">
the Secrets of my Soul, which cau&s;ed the Love in me always to continue, yea &s;ometimes to encrea&s;e towards them: But daily my Under&s;tanding got more and more over them, and therein I daily more and more de&s;pi&s;ed them.</P>
<P>After a long Time I was invited to hear one of them (as I had been often, they in tender Love pitying me, and feeling my Want of that, which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed) and there was an An&s;wer in my Heart, and I went in Fear and Trembling, with De&s;ires to the mo&s;t High, who was over all and knew all, that I might not receive any Thing for Truth, which was not of him, nor with&s;tand any Thing which was of him, but might how before the Appearance of the Lord my God, and none other. And indeed, when I came, I felt the Pre&s;ence and Power of the mo&s;t High among them, and Words of Truth, from the Spirit of Truth, reaching to my Heart and Con&s;cience, opening my State as in the Pre&s;ence of the Lord. Yea, I did not only feel Words and Demon&s;trations from without, but I felt the Dead quickned, the Seed rai&s;ed, in&s;omuch as my Heart (in the Cer|tainty of Light, and Clearne&s;s of true Sen&s;e)&s;aid, <HI>This is he, this is he, there is no other; this is He whom I have waited for and fought after from my Childhood, who was always near me, and had often begotten Life in my Heart, but I knew him not di&s;tinctly, nor how to receive him or dwell with him.</HI> And then in this Sen&s;e (in the Melting and Breakings of my Spirit) was I given up to the Lord to become his, both in waiting for the farther Revealings of his Seed in me, and to &s;erve him in the Life and Power of his Seed.</P>
<P>Now what I met with after this, in my Travels, in my Waitings, in my &s;piritnal Exerci&s;es, is not to be uttered; only in general I may &s;ay this, I met with the very Strength of Hell. The cruel Oppre&s;&s;or roared upon me, and made me feel the bitterne&s;s of his Captivity, while he had any Power: Yea, the Lord was far from my Help, and from the Voice of my roaring. I al&s;o met with deep Subtilties and Devices to entangle me in that Wi&s;dom, which &s;eemeth able to make wi&s;e in the Things of God, but indeed is Fooli&s;hne&s;s and a Snare to the Soul, bringing it back into Captivity, where the Emmy's Gins prevail And what I met with outwardly from my own dear Father, from my Kindred, from my Servants, from the People and Powers of the World, for tio other Cau&s;e but fearing my God, wor&s;hipping him as he hath required of me, and bowing to his Seed (which is his Son) who is to be wor&s;hipped by Men and Angels for evermore; the Lord my God knoweth, before whom my Heart and Ways are, who pre&s;erved me in Love to them, in the mid&s;t of all I &s;uffered from them, and doth &s;till &s;o pre&s;erve me, ble&s;|&s;ed be his pure and holy Name.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may de&s;ire to know, what I have at la&s;t met with: I an&s;wer, <HI>I have met with the Seed.</HI> Under&s;tand that Word, and thou wilt be &s;atisfied, and enquire no farther. I have met with my God, I have met with my Saviour; and he hath not been pre&s;ent with me without his Salvation, but I have felt the Healings drop upon my Soul from under his Wings; I have met with the true Knowledge, the Knowledge of Life, the living Knowledge, the Knowledge which is Life, and this hath had the true Vertue in it, which my Soul hath rejoiced in, in the Pre&s;ence of the Lord. I have met with the Seed's Fa|ther, and in the Seed I have felt him my Father: There I have read his Nature, his Love, his Compa&s;&s;ions, his Tenderne&s;s, which have melted, over|come and changed my Heart before him. I have met with the Seed's Faith, which hath done and doth that, which the Faith of Man can never do. I have met with the true Birth, with the Birth which is Heir of the King|dom, and inherits the Kingdom. I have met with the true Spirit of Pray|er and Supplication, wherein the Lord is prevailed with, and which draws from him whatever the Condition needs, the Soul always looking up to him in the Will, and in the Time and Way which is acceptable with him. What &s;hall I &s;ay? I have met with the true Peace, the true Righteou&s;ne&s;s, the
<PB N="651" REF="003104_0662_0FEFF979B0520E60">
true Holine&s;s, the true Re&s;t of the Soul, the everla&s;ting Habitation, which the Redeemed dwell in: And I know all the&s;e to be true, in him that is true, and am capable of no Doubt, Di&s;pute or Rea&s;oning in my Mind about them, it abiding there, where it hath received the full A&s;&s;urance and Sa|tisfaction. And al&s;o I know very well and di&s;tinctly in Spirit, where the Doubts and Di&s;putes are, and where the Certainty and full A&s;&s;urance is, and in the tender Mercy of the Lord am pre&s;erved out of the one, and in the other.</P>
<P>Now (the Lord knows) the&s;e Things I do not utter in a boa&s;ting Way, but would rather be &s;peaking of my Nothingne&s;s, my Emptine&s;s, my Weak|ne&s;s, my manifold Infirmities which I feel more than ever. The Lord hath broken the Man's Part in me, and I am a Worm and no Man before him: I have no Strengh to do any Good or Service for him, nay I cannot watch over or pre&s;erve my &s;elf: I feel daily that I keep not alive my own Soul, but am weaker before Men, yea weaker in my Spirit (as in my &s;elf) than ever I have been. But I cannot but utter to the Prai&s;e of my God, that I feel his Arm &s;tretched out for me; and my Weakne&s;s (which I feel in my &s;elf) is not my Lo&s;s, but Advantage before him. And the&s;e Things I write, as having no End at all therein of my own, but felt it this Morning required of me, and &s;o in Submi&s;&s;ion and Subjection to my God, have I given up to do it, leaving the Succe&s;s and Service of it with him.</P>

<P>From this Conclu&s;ion we &s;ee the Humility of the Mind of this Friend,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Caution to conceived Wits.</NOTE> who, when he writ this, was already much advanced in the Way of Godline&s;s, and had lived &s;everal Years in the Communion of tho&s;e cal|led <HI>Quakers.</HI> Now, tho' it be the Duty of every one, not to be con|ceited of him&s;elf, yet certain it is, that Men of refined Wits above all others have need to continue truly humble, and not to rely thereon, &s;ince the tru&s;ting to Acutene&s;s of Wit hath rather drawn off many from the Way of Truth, than led them to it; nay, it hath occa&s;ioned the Fall of &s;ome. But that <HI>I. Pennington</HI> endeavoured to continue in true Humility, appears plainly from the Relation above. He was a Man of a very compa&s;&s;ionate Temper, and yet valiant in Adver&s;ities: He al&s;o &s;uffered not a little on the Account of his Religion, but endured many tedious and long Impri&s;onments, which were the more hard to him, becau&s;e he being of a weakly Con&s;titution, the Suffering of Cold and Hard&s;hip, did him the more Hurt. And yet he never fainted, but con|tinued &s;tedfa&s;t to the End of his Life, which was in the latter Part of the Year 1679, when he departed in a pious Frame of Mind.</P>
<P>By the foregoing Relation it appears evidently that he was very ear|ne&s;tly &s;eeking after the true Way to Salvation, before he attained to a perfect Quietne&s;s of Mind; yet in that Time there wanted not &s;uch as were helpful to him with good and whole&s;ome Advice; and among the&s;e <HI>John Crook</HI> (who&s;e Occurrences make up no &s;mall Part of this Hi&s;tory) was none of the lea&s;t.

who are born from above, Heirs of an everla&s;ting Inheritance. Oh! how &s;weet and plea&s;ant are the Pa&s;tures which my Father cau&s;eth all his Sheep to feed in; there is Variety of Plenty in his Pa&s;tures, Milk for Babes, and &s;trong Meat for them of riper Age, and Wine to refre&s;h tho&s;e that are ready to faint, even the Wine of the King|dom, that makes glad the Heart when it is ready to faint, by Rea|&s;on of the Infirmities: Sure I am, none can be &s;o weary but he takes Care of them, nor none &s;o nigh fainting but he puts his Arm under their Heads, nor none can be &s;o be&s;et with Enemies on every Side, but he will ari&s;e and &s;catter, nor none &s;o heavy laden and big with Young but he takes Notice of them, and gently leads them, and will not leave them behind unto the mercile&s;s Wolf, becau&s;e they are his own, and his Life is the Price of their Redemption, and his Blood of their Ran&s;ome; and if they be &s;o young that they cannot go, he carries them in his Arms, and when they can feel nothing &s;tirring af|ter him, his Bowels yearn after them; &s;o tender is this good Shep|herd after all his Flock. I can tell, for I was as one that once went a&s;tray, and wandered upon the barren Mountains; and when I had wearied my &s;elf with Wandering, I went into the Wilderne&s;s, and there I was torn as with Briars, and pricked as with Thorns, &s;ome|times thinking this was the Way, and &s;ometimes concluding that was the Way, and by and by concluding all was out of the Way, and then bitter Mourning came upon me, and Weeping for Want of the Interpreter; for when I &s;ought to know what was the Matter, and where I was, it was too hard for me; then I thought I would ven|ture on &s;ome Way where it was mo&s;t likely to find a lo&s;t God, and I would pray with them that prayed, and fa&s;t with them that fa&s;ted, and mourn with them that mourned, if by any Means I might come to Re&s;t, but found it not, until I came to &s;ee the Candle lighted in my own Hou&s;e, and my Heart &s;wept from tho&s;e Thoughts and Ima|ginations, and Willings, and Runnings, and to die unto them all, not heeding of them, but watching again&s;t them, le&s;t I &s;hould let my Mind go a whoring after them; and here I dwelt for a Time as in a de&s;olate Land uninhabited, where I &s;at alone as a Sparrow upon the Hou&s;e-top, and was hunted up and down like a Partridge upon the Mountains, and could re&s;t no where, but &s;ome Lu&s;t or Thought or other followed me at the Heels, and di&s;quieted me Night and Day, until I came to know him in whom was Re&s;t, and no Occa&s;ion of Stumbling, in whom the Devil hath no Part, and he became unto me as an Hiding-place from the Storms, and from the Tempe&s;ts. Then came my Eyes to &s;ee my Saviour, and my Sorrow to fly away, and he became made unto me all in all, my Wi&s;dom, my Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and my Sanctification, in whom I was and am compleat, to the Prai&s;e of the Riches of his Grace and Goodne&s;s that endures forever.

me: Therefore I de&s;ire to live, that I might live an holy and righteous Life, that my Conver&s;ation might be in Heaven, tho' my Body be here on Earth.

When I &s;ought thee but could not find thee; I knocked hard but none did open; for my Sins &s;tood like Mountains, that I could not come near thee: I would fain have prayed to thee but could not. Thus I lay &s;everal Days and Nights, &s;truggling for Life, but could find none; and I &s;aid, There is no Mercy for me: Then I &s;aid, I will never leave thee; if I peri&s;h, I will peri&s;h here; I will never cea&s;e crying unto thee. And then I heard a Voice &s;ay,</HI> Jacob wre&s;tled all Night before he ob|tained the Ble&s;&s;ing. <HI>Oh then thy Word, O Lord, was &s;trong to my Soul: Then my &s;tony Heart was broken to Pieces, and the Spirit of Prayer and Supplication was poured upon me. And now I can &s;ing as</HI> David <HI>did, of Mercy and of Judgment: Unto thee, O Lord, will I &s;ing with a rent Heart, and with my Mouth in the Du&s;t will I &s;ing Prai&s;es to thee, my ble&s;&s;ed Saviour.</HI> In this Frame &s;he endeavoured to continue, and once &s;he pray|ed for her Father, called <HI>Robert Whitrow,</HI> Part of which Prayer was as followeth. <HI>O Lord, remember not his Offences, let me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear them; let it be ea&s;y to him; make his Friends to be Enemies to him, that thou may&s;t have Mercy upon him.

O Lord, let his Mind be &s;et on Things above; fix his Mind upon thee.</HI> Thus fervently this young Maid prayed for her Father, her&s;elf now having attained to a full A&s;&s;urance of her Salvation, &s;o that &s;he once &s;aid to the Lord: <HI>O thou Beloved of my Soul, what &s;hall I &s;ay of thee!

I have &s;een thy Glory; I am overcome with thy &s;weet Countenance: O how lovely art thou! My Heart is ravi&s;hed with the &s;weet Smiles of thy glorious Countenance. O, come away, come away! Why do&s;t thou &s;tay? I am ready, I am ready.</HI> Then &s;he lay &s;ome Time very &s;till, and &s;o departed this Life without Sigh or Groan, which was about the Year 1677.</P>

frequented their Meetings. In the mean while many of the&s;e became more and more confirmed in their Minds by this &s;ilent Exerci&s;e, and their Under&s;tandings came to be &s;o opened, that in Proce&s;s of Time they became apt and fit In&s;truments to exhort others to Godline&s;s: And among the&s;e, &s;everal Women al&s;o found it their Duty to preach the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>There have been many who were very aver&s;e to the <HI>Quakers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>C. Bacon</HI> going to a Meeting in a vain Mind, is &s;o reach'd, that in Time he be|came a zealous Preacher and Sufferer among Friends.</NOTE> and yet came to join with them in the Faith; as among others <HI>Chri&s;topher Bacon</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> who (about the Year 1656, coming into a Meet|ing, not with Intention to be edified there, but rather to &s;coff, and to fetch his Wife from thence, who went thither again&s;t his Mind) was &s;o reached by the lively Exhortation he heard, that he was not only con|vinced of the Truth preached there, but in Time became a zealous Preacher of it him&s;elf, and was valiant in Sufferings. Once being taken up at a Meeting at <HI>Gla&s;&s;enbury,</HI> and brought before Bi&s;hop <HI>Mew</HI> at <HI>Wells,</HI> who called him a <HI>Rebel,</HI> for meeting contrary to the King's Laws, <HI>Chri&s;topher,</HI> having formerly been a Soldier for the King, &s;aid to him, <HI>Do&s;t thou call me Rebel? I would have thee to know, that I have ventured my Life for the King in the Field, when &s;uch as thou lay behind Hedges.</HI> By this he &s;top'd the Bi&s;hop's Mouth, who did not expect &s;uch an An|&s;wer, and therefore was willing to be rid of him.</P>
<P>The like In&s;tance of an unexpected Conver&s;ion was &s;een al&s;o in <HI>William Gib&s;on,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Gib&s;on</HI> convinced going to di&s;trub <HI>T.

<P>To the&s;e In&s;tances I may add that of a certain Trumpeter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And a Trum|peter much in the like Manner.</NOTE> who com|ing into a <HI>Quakers</HI> Meeting, began in an in&s;olent Manner to &s;ound his Trumpet, thereby to drown the Voice of him that preached: But this had a contrary Effect, and &s;tirred up the Zeal of the Preacher the more, &s;o that he went on as if none di&s;turbed him. The Trumpeter at length to recover his Breath, was fain to cea&s;e blowing; but being &s;till govern'd by an evil Spirit, after &s;ome Intermi&s;&s;ion began to &s;ound again: But whatever he did, he was not able to divert the Preacher from his Di&s;|cour&s;e, tho' he hindred the Auditory from hearing what was &s;poken. Thus he wearied him&s;elf &s;o much, that he was forced to re&s;t again for Re&s;piration; whereby, in Spight of his evil Will, he came to hear what the Preacher &s;poke, which was &s;o piercing, that the Trumpeter came to be deeply affected with it, and bur&s;ting out into Tears, con|fe&s;s'd his Crime, and came to be a true Penitent; a remarkable Evidence of the Truth of that Saying of the Apo&s;tle;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. ix. 16.</NOTE> <HI>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that &s;heweth Mercy.</HI></P>

received &s;uch pertinent An&s;wers from <HI>J. Naylor,</HI> that in a great Degree he was convinced of the Truth held by <HI>J. N.</HI> and his Friends.</P>
<P>By what hath been related here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conclu&s;ion of this Book manife&s;ts the Increa&s;e of this People, not|with&s;tanding the Severity and Cruelty of their Adver&s;aries, and at length their being to|lerated by Law.</NOTE> may be &s;een how unexpectedly &s;ome entred into Society with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called; more In&s;tances of which might be produced if needful, &s;ince I have known &s;uch, who being natu|rally of a boi&s;terous Temper, yet were &s;o &s;truck with the Terror of the Lord, that they came to be of &s;uch a quiet Spirit, and harmle&s;s Be|haviour, that as formerly they could not &s;uffer the lea&s;t Provocation, &s;o now they bore all Revilings and Mockings with an even and undi&s;turbed Mind, becau&s;e the Fear of God had made &s;uch deep Impre&s;&s;ions upon them, that they were careful, le&s;t by an angry or impetuous Deport|ment, they &s;hould &s;in again&s;t him. And thus continuing to live in Fear, and a reverential Awe, they improved in true Godline&s;s; in&s;omuch, that by their pious Lives, they preached as well as others with Words. After this Manner the Number of their Society encrea&s;ed; but then grievous Sufferings en&s;ued; for the Prie&s;ts could not endure to &s;ee that their Hearers left them; the furious Mob were &s;purred on, and among the Magi&s;trates there were many, who being of a fierce Temper, u&s;ed all their Strength to root out the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Light, (as they were called at fir&s;t) and to &s;uppre&s;s and &s;tifle their Doctrine: But all proved in vain, as appears abundantly from this Hi&s;tory, altho' there were hardly Pri&s;ons in <HI>England,</HI> where &s;ome of the&s;e People were not &s;hut up, be&s;ides the Spoil of Goods, and cruel Whippings that befel &s;ome of them. Yet all this they bore with a more than ordinary Courage, without making Re&s;i&s;tance, how great &s;oever their Number was, and notwith&s;tanding many of them had been valiant Soldiers, who often had &s;lain their Enemies in the Field, without regarding Danger.</P>
<P>In the Con&s;ideration of this undaunted Stedfa&s;tne&s;s, it hath &s;eemed to me, that there have been &s;ome &s;uch among this People, who&s;e Ta|lent was, valiantly to endure Per&s;ecution for a good Cau&s;e, and who perhaps in Ea&s;e would not have been &s;uch good Chri&s;tians, as they proved to be under the&s;e Sufferings; re&s;embling the <HI>Cammomil</HI> in this, which the more it is depre&s;&s;ed, or rubbed, the better it grows, and yields the &s;tronger Scent. Being then thus oppre&s;&s;ed, they found them&s;elves under a Nece&s;&s;ity of continuing vigilant and watchful, and according to King <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Advice, to <HI>keep their Heart with all Diligence.</HI> This made them love what they judged to be Truth more than their Lives, and it cau&s;ed them to be careful, le&s;t that &s;hould come over them which the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> was threatened with, becau&s;e &s;he had left her fir&s;t Love, <HI>viz.</HI> the Removing of her Candle&s;tick out of its Place. Thus their mutual Love increa&s;ed, and their own Lives they valued not, when the grieving of their Con&s;ciences &s;tood in Competition with it. Having thus pa&s;s'd thro' many Adver&s;ities, with an unwearied and la&s;ting Pa|tience, and being become a great People, known by the Name of <HI>Qua|kers,</HI> they were at length, by the generous Clemency of King <HI>William</HI> III. and the Favour of the Parliament, declared to be a Society, who &s;hould henceforth be tolerated in the Kingdom as <HI>Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> with Liberty to perform their Religious Wor&s;hip in publick without Di&s;|turbance.</P>

In the &s;eventieth Year of her Age &s;he &s;poke again with the King, which was the la&s;t Time; but &s;he was not received &s;o favourably as formerly, for he &s;eemed to be &s;omewhat angry; and therefore &s;he writ to him, and &s;taid at <HI>London</HI> in Hopes of an An&s;wer; but he was &s;uddenly taken away by Death. Afterwards &s;he &s;poke with King <HI>James,</HI> and writ to him al&s;o. And at length, after a laborious and godly Life, &s;he piou&s;ly departed from hence in a great Age, as hath been &s;aid already, having uttered in the Time of her Sickne&s;s many excellent Sayings, by which it appeared that &s;he was prepared for Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>She writ</HI> The Call of the Jews out of Babylon, <HI>dedi|cated to</HI> M.

<P>But before I conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Something as to their Doc|trine. Concerning the Light.</NOTE> I intend to &s;ay &s;omething concerning their Doctrine, of which Mention hath been often made in this Work, <HI>viz.</HI> That their chief Principle, in which they differ from the Generality of modern Chri&s;tian Societies, is, that every Man is enlightned with the Divine Light, according to the Evangeli&s;t <HI>John,</HI> who in the fir&s;t Chapter, &s;peaking of Chri&s;t as he was from Eternity with the Father, calls him <HI>the Word,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John i. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> and &s;aith, That <HI>The Word was God, that all Things were made by him, that in him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.</HI> And the Evangeli&s;t &s;peaking concerning <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, who was &s;ent from God, &s;aith, <HI>He was not that Light, but was &s;ent to bear Witne&s;s of that Light: That was the true Light, which lighteth every Man that cometh into the World.</HI> By this it appears, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> have not coin'd a new Phra&s;e, but only made u&s;e of the expre&s;s Words of the holy Scripture. I am not unacquainted that, during the great Apo&s;tacy, Peo|ple generally have not clearly under&s;tood this; yet it ought not to &s;eem &s;trange, becau&s;e the Evangeli&s;t &s;aith, <HI>The Light &s;hineth in Darkne&s;s, and the Darkne&s;s comprehended it not.</HI> But to elucidate this Doctrine a little more, it may &s;erve for Information, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> believe this Light to be the &s;ame that the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> calls <HI>The Grace of God that bring|eth Salvation, and hath appeared to all Men:</HI> And concerning its Opera|tion, he &s;aith, <HI>teaching us, that denying Ungodline&s;s, and worldly Lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent World.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much briefly concerning the above-mentioned Denominations of this Divine Light; and to make it appear more plainly what this Phra&s;e means, <HI>Take heed to the Light;</HI> thereby we under&s;tand, that each one minding the Coun&s;el of the Light in their Souls, may learn to fear God, and hate Pride, Arrogancy, and every evil Way, which will beget in us &s;uch a reverential Awe towards God, that we dare not do any Thing which we certainly know will di&s;plea&s;e him; and this is the fir&s;t Step to Godline&s;s: And therefore both <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> have &s;aid, that <HI>the Fear of God is the Beginning of Wi&s;dom,</HI> viz. that Fear which is filial and accompanied with Circum&s;pection and Cautiou&s;ne&s;s; and as we per&s;evere in this Fear, <HI>we are enabled to &s;erve the Lord in Holine&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s all the Days of our Life.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ince we can do this only by the Grace of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prayer.</NOTE> 'tis ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary that we take heed thereto: And therefore we ought to pray to God continually for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. But here &s;tarts up &s;omething, of

which People generally have a wrong Notion: For all Sorts of Chri|&s;tians agree, that we mu&s;t often pray to God, but in the manner of it many err greatly.

It is al&s;o worth taking notice, that <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t &s;aid, that Chri&s;t &s;hould baptize <HI>with Fire;</HI> by which it appears, that both <HI>Water</HI> and <HI>Fire</HI> in this Sen&s;e are metaphorical Expre&s;&s;ions: For they both &s;erve for clean&s;ing and purifying, tho' in a different Way. Now altho' &s;ome did baptize with Water, yet it ought to be con&s;idered, that if the Com|mand of Chri&s;t to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>Go ye and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Gho&s;t,</HI> related ab&s;olutely to Water-Bapti&s;m, it would indeed have been very &s;trange, that <HI>Paul</HI> that eminent Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> did not think him&s;elf commi&s;&s;ionated for the Admini&s;tration of that Bapti&s;m. Where|as, if the Apo&s;tles had really received a Commi&s;&s;ion from the Lord to that Purpo&s;e, he by no Means would have been &s;ingled out; &s;ince &s;peaking of him&s;elf he &s;aith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. xi. 5.</NOTE> that <HI>he &s;uppo&s;ed he was not a whit behind the very chiefe&s;t Apo&s;tles;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. i. 17. v. 14.</NOTE> and yet he al&s;o &s;aith in expre&s;s Terms, <HI>Chri&s;t &s;ent me not to baptize, but to preach the Go&s;pel.</HI> And, <HI>I thank God that I baptized none of you but</HI> Cri&s;pus <HI>and</HI> Gaius. <HI>And I baptized al&s;o the Hou&s;hold of</HI> Stephanas: <HI>Be&s;ides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</HI> And yet he &s;aith, <HI>There is one Lord, one Faith, one Bapti&s;m,</HI> which was the Bapti&s;m of the Spirit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. i. 16.</NOTE> And the &s;ame Apo&s;tle &s;aith al&s;o, <HI>As many as have been baptized into Chri&s;t,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. iv. 5.</NOTE> <HI>have put on Chri&s;t:</HI> And this cannot have Relation to Water-Bapti&s;m,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. iii. 27.</NOTE> becau&s;e many receive that, who ne|ver put on Chri&s;t, and become conformable to his Image, which how|ever is required of all Chri&s;tians.

<P>Concerning the <HI>outward Supper</HI> it may be truly &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The outward Supper.</NOTE> that it was the Pa&s;&s;over that was kept by Chri&s;t at the eating of the Pa&s;chal Lamb, which likewi&s;e was a Judaical Ceremony, that Chri&s;tians generally take to be a Figure or Shadow.

<P>But I leave this Matter to &s;ay &s;omething al&s;o concerning the Way of Wor&s;hip of the People called <HI>Quakers.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of Wor+&s;hip.</NOTE> It is u&s;ual among them, when they meet together in their Religious A&s;&s;emblies, to &s;pend &s;ome Time in a devout Silence and Retiredne&s;s of Mind, inwardly praying with pure Breathings to God, which they generally call <HI>Waiting upon the Lord:</HI> And if, under this Spiritual Exerci&s;e, any one feels him&s;elf &s;tirred up of God, to &s;peak &s;omething by Way of Doctrine or Exhor|tation, he doth &s;o, and &s;ometimes more than one, but orderly, one after another.

<P>The mo&s;t remarkable Occurrences the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>England</HI> now met with, were, that they enjoying the Liberty to perform their Religious Wor&s;hip publickly without Di&s;turbance, were afterward encounter'd by the Writings of their Enemies from Ignorance or Envy, and repre&s;ented as Maintainers of Heterodox Sentiments; but they not &s;ailing of An|&s;wers, the Eyes of many were opened, and &s;ome came over to them.

inclined to more Liberty, and to be e&s;teemed by the World; yet there have been others of the Epi&s;copal Church, who not from any earthly Con&s;ideration, but meerly by a Convincement of their Mind, have en|ter'd into Society with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> not &s;caring to make publick Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of their Religion, as may appear by two Letters which I'll in|&s;ert here; the one of <HI>Samuel Cri&s;p,</HI> a Clergyman of the Epi&s;copal Church, who gave the following Account of his Change to one of his Relations.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received a Letter from thee the Week before la&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter of <HI>S.

<P>The News thou ha&s;t heard of my late Change is really true, I cannot conceal it, for it is what I glory in; neither was it any Pro&s;pect of temporal Advantage that induced me to it, but a &s;incere Love to the Truth, and pure Regard to my own Soul: Neither can I be &s;ufficiently thankful to God, that he hath let me live to this glorious Day, and not cut me off in the mid&s;t of my Sins and Provocations again&s;t him; he is long-&s;uffering to us ward, not willing that any &s;hould pe|ri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to Repentance: He hath brought me off from the Forms and Shadows of Religion, and let me &s;ee in a more illu&s;trious Manner what is the Life and Sub&s;tance of it, as he found me in &s;ome Degree faithful to that Mea&s;ure of Light and Know|ledge he had be&s;towed on me, whil&s;t I was in the Communion of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> therefore he was plea&s;ed of late, as I humbly waited upon him, to make known to me greater and deeper My&s;teries of his Kingdom; and I can truly &s;ay, that I find by daily Experience, as I keep low and retired into that pure Gift which he hath planted within me, Things are every Day more and more cleared up to me. and the Truth &s;hines and prevails greatly over the Kingdom of Dark|ne&s;s; and if I &s;hould now turn my Back upon &s;uch Manife&s;tations as the&s;e, and entangle my &s;elf again with the Yoke of Bondage, &s;urely I &s;hould grieve the holy Spirit, &s;o that he might ju&s;tly with|draw his kind Operations, and never return more to a&s;&s;i&s;t and comfort me; for God is not mocked; Religion is a very &s;erious and weighty Thing; Repentance and Salvation are not to be trifled with, nor is Turning to God to be put off till our own Time, Lei&s;ure or Conve|niency, but we mu&s;t love and cheri&s;h the lea&s;t Appearance of Chri&s;t, not &s;lighting or de&s;pi&s;ing the Day of &s;mall Things, but embrace the fir&s;t Opportunity of following Chri&s;t in any of his Commands: When he &s;peaks there is &s;uch Force and Authority in it, that we cannot &s;tand to cavil, di&s;pute or ask Que&s;tions; for unle&s;s we will be &s;o ob|&s;tinate as to &s;hut our Eyes again&s;t the Sun, we mu&s;t needs confe&s;s to the Truth of his Doctrine, and pre&s;ently &s;trike in with it; and therefore when for &s;everal Weeks I had lived more privately and re|tiredly in <HI>London,</HI> than was u&s;ual, fa&s;ting twice or thrice in a Week, or &s;ometimes more, &s;pending my Time in reading the Scriptures, and in Prayer to God, this was a good Preparation of my Mind to re|ceive the Truth which he was then about to make known to me: I lamented the Errors of my pa&s;t Life, and was de&s;irous to attain a more excellent Degree of Holine&s;s than I had di&s;covered in the Church

of <HI>England.</HI> In this religious Retirement God knew the Breathings of my Soul, how &s;incere I was, and re&s;igned to him when alone; I wanted him to &s;et me free, and to &s;peak Peace and Comfort to my Soul, which was grieved and wearied with the Burden of Sin; for tho' I had &s;trictly conformed my &s;elf to the Orders and Ceremonies of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and had kept my &s;elf from running into any great or &s;candalous Enormities, the Fear of the Almighty pre&s;erving me, yet &s;till I had not that Re&s;t and Satisfaction in my &s;elf which I de|&s;ired, and greatly longed for; I found when I had examined my State and Condition to God-ward, that Things were not right with me.</P>
<P>As for a &s;ober and plau&s;ible Conver&s;ation in the Eye of the World, I knew that was a very ea&s;y Attainment, a good natural Temper, with the Advantage of a literal Education, will quickly furni&s;h a Man with Abilities for that, &s;o that he &s;hall be looked upon as a Saint, and very &s;piritual, when perhaps in Chains of Darkne&s;s, in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s, and in the very Bond of Iniquity: If this Sort of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s would have done, perhaps I might make as fair Preten&s;ions that Way as &s;ome others; but alas, I quickly &s;aw the Emptine&s;s and Un&s;atisfactorine&s;s of tho&s;e Things: This is a Covering that will not protect or hide us from the Wrath of the Almighty when he comes to Judgment: 'Tis not a Man's natural Temper, nor his Educa|tion that makes him a good Chri&s;tian; this is not the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which the Go&s;pel calls for, nor is this the Truth in the inward Parts which God requires; the Heart and Affections mu&s;t be clean&s;ed and purified before we can be acceptable to God; therefore it was Death to me to think of taking up my Re&s;t in a formal Pretence of Holine&s;s, wherein yet I &s;aw to my Grief Abundance of People wrapt them&s;elves, &s;lept &s;ecurely and quietly, Dreaming of the Feli|city of Paradice, as if Heaven were now their own, and they needed not trouble them&s;elves any more about Religion: I could not enter|tain &s;o dangerous an Opinion as this, for then I &s;hould be tempted to take up my Re&s;t by the Way, whil&s;t I was travelling towards the promi&s;ed Land. I think I made a little Progre&s;s in a holy Life, and thro' God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance I weakned &s;ome of my &s;piritual Enemies whil&s;t I lived in the Communion of the National Church. I thank my God I can truly &s;ay, whil&s;t I u&s;ed tho&s;e Prayers I did it with Zeal and Sincerity, in his Fear and Dread, but &s;till I cea&s;ed not my earne&s;t Supplication to him in private, that he would &s;hew me Something more excellent, that I might get a compleat Victory over all my Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions, and might perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s before him; for I found a great many Sins and Weakne&s;&s;es daily attending me: And tho' I made frequent Re&s;olutions to for&s;ake tho&s;e Sins, yet &s;till the Temp|tation was too &s;trong for me, &s;o that often I had Cau&s;e to complain with the Apo&s;tle in the Bitterne&s;s of my Soul, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</HI> Who &s;hall &s;et me free, and give me Strength to triumph over Sin, the World, and the Devil? That I may in every Thing plea&s;e God, and there may not be the lea&s;t Thought, Word, or Motion, Ge&s;ture, or Action, but what is exactly agreeable to his mo&s;t holy Will, as if I &s;aw him &s;tanding before me, and as if I were to be judged by him for the Thought of my Heart next Moment. O Divine Life! O Seraphick Soul! O that I could always &s;tand here! for here is no Reflection, no Sorrow, no Repentance! but at God's Right-Hand there is perfect Peace, and a River of un&s;peakable Joy. O that we might imitate the Life of Je&s;us, and be throughly furni&s;hed unto every good Word and Work! This was the frequent Breathing of my Soul to God when I was in the Country, but more e&s;pecially after I had left my new

Preferment of a Chaplain, and took private Lodgings in <HI>London:</HI> In this Retirement I hope I may &s;ay, without Boa&s;ting, that I was very devout and religious, and I found great Comfort and Refre&s;hment in it from the Lord, who let me &s;ee the Beauty of Holine&s;s; and the Sweetne&s;s that ari&s;es from an humbled mortified Life, was then ve|ry plea&s;ant to my Ta&s;te, and I rejoiced in it more than in all the De|light and Plea&s;ures of the World.</P>

As for the <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;o called, I was &s;o great a Stranger to them, that I had never read any of their Books, nor do I remember, that ever I converted with any one Man of that Communion in my whole Life: I think there was one in <HI>Foxly</HI> while I was Curate there, but I never &s;aw the Man, tho' I went &s;everal Times to his Hou&s;e on Purpo&s;e to talk with him, and to bring him off from his mad and wild Enthu&s;ia&s;m, as I then ignorantly thought it to be: As for that Way, I knew it was every where &s;poken again&s;t; he that had a Mind to appear more witty and ingenious than the re&s;t, would chu&s;e this for the Subject of his profane Je&s;ts and Drollery; with this he makes Sport, and diverts the Company; for a <HI>Quaker</HI> is but another Name for a Fool or a Mad-man, and was &s;carce ever mention'd but with Scorn and Contempt. As for Drollery, I con&s;e&s;s I was never any great Friend to it; but indeed if all was true that was laid to the <HI>Quakers</HI> Charge, I thought that they were &s;ome of the wor&s;t People that ever appeared in the World, and wondred with what Face they could call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, &s;ince I was told they denied the fundamental Articles of the holy Faith, to which I ever bore the highe&s;t Veneration and E&s;teem; and notwith&s;tanding I had always lived at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance from that People, and was very zealous in the Wor&s;hip of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and upon all Occa&s;ions would &s;peak very honourably of it, moreover was content to &s;uffer &s;ome few Inconveniences upon that Account, (as thou very well knowe&s;t) yet my Father &s;till look'd upon me as inclining to the <HI>Quakers;</HI> and &s;ome Years ago &s;ignified to a Friend, he was afraid I would become an Enthu&s;ia&s;t; and whil&s;t I was at <HI>Bungan</HI> School, he &s;ent me two Books to read that were writ again&s;t the <HI>Quakers,</HI> one of which was <HI>John; Foldo's,</HI> who hath been &s;ufficiently expo&s;ed for it by <HI>William Penn.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t I lived in <HI>London</HI> in that private retired Manner (I was ju&s;t now &s;peaking of) walking very humbly in the Sight of God, and having Opportunity to reflect upon my pa&s;t Life, as I had Oca|&s;ion to be one Day at a Book&s;eller's Shop, I happened to ca&s;t my Eye on <HI>Barclay's</HI> Works; and having heard in the Country, that he was a Man of great Account among&s;t the <HI>Quakers,</HI> I had a Mind to &s;ee what their Principles were, and what Defence they could make for them|&s;elves; for &s;ure, thought I, the&s;e People are not &s;o &s;illy and ridiculous, nor Maintainers of &s;uch horrid Opinions, as the Author of the <HI>Snake,</HI> and &s;ome others would make us believe. I took <HI>Barclay</HI> home with me, and I read him thro'in a Week's Time, &s;ave a little Treati&s;e at the End, which I found to be very philo&s;ophical, I omitted; but however I &s;oon read enough to convince me of my own Blindne&s;s and Ignorance in the Things of God; there I found a Light to break in upon my Mind, which did mightily re&s;re&s;h and comfort me in that poor, low, and humbled State, in which I then was; for indeed I was then, and had been for a con&s;iderable Time before, very hungry

and thir&s;ty after Rightcou&s;ne&s;s, and therefore I received the Truth with all Readine&s;s of Mind; 'twas like Balm to my Soul, and as Showers of Rain to the thir&s;ty Earth, which is parched with Heat and Drought. This Author laid Things down &s;o plainly, and proved them with &s;uch Ingenuity and Dexterity of Learning, and opened the Scriptures &s;o clearly to me, that without &s;tanding to cavil, di&s;pute, rai&s;e Argument or Objection., or con&s;ulting with Fle&s;h and Blood, I pre&s;ently re&s;igned my &s;elf to God, and weeping for Joy that I had found &s;o great a Trea&s;ure, I often thanked him with Tears in my Eyes for &s;o kind a Vi&s;itation of his Love, that he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to look to|ward me when my Soul cried after him; &s;o, tho' before I was in great Doubt and Trouble of Mind, not knowing which way to determine my &s;elf, yet now the Sun breaking out &s;o powerfully upon me, the Clouds were &s;cattered: I was now fully &s;atisfied in my own Mind which Way I ought to go, and to what Body of People I &s;hould join my &s;elf.</P>
<P>So I immediately left the Communion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and went to <HI>Gracious-&s;treet</HI> Meeting. After I had read <HI>Barclay,</HI> I read &s;ome other Books of that Kind, among which was an excellent Piece, tho' in a &s;mall Volume, called, <HI>No Cro&s;s, no Crown:</HI> Thus I continued reading and frequenting Meetings for &s;everal Weeks together, but did not let any one Soul know what I was about: The fir&s;t Man I con|ver&s;ed with was <HI>George Whitehead,</HI> and this was &s;everal Weeks after I began to read <HI>Barclay,</HI> and frequent their Meetings: By him I was introduced into more Acquaintance, and &s;till the farther I went, the more I liked their Plainne&s;s, and the Decency and Simplicity of their Conver&s;ation: They do not u&s;e the Ceremonies and Salutations of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but &s;hake Hands freely, and conver&s;e together as Brothers and Si&s;ters that are &s;prung of the &s;ame Royal Seed, and made Kings and Prie&s;ts unto God. O, the Love, the Sweetne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s of Affection I have &s;een among this People! <HI>By this,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t, <HI>&s;hall all Men know that ye are my Di&s;ciples, if ye have Love one to another: Put on therefore,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, (<HI>as the Elect of God holy and beloved) Bowels of Mercy, Kindne&s;s, Humblene&s;s of Mind, Meekne&s;s, Long-&s;uffering.</HI></P>

Choice of my Per&s;ua&s;ion, and Way of returning my Acknowledgments to him. I wi&s;h that all, who make any Preten&s;ions to Religion, would make U&s;e of this noble Faculty with Subjection to the Divine Will, to determine their Choice in this grand Affair; and not let the Religion of their Educa|tion be that of their Judgment. If People were thus truly wi&s;e unto their own Salvation, and did not too lazily re&s;ign thm&s;elves to the Conduct of their Guide, thereby regarding more their Ea&s;e than Safety, they would not on|ly be the better able to give a Rea&s;on of the Hope that is in them, but they would &s;hew more Warmth in their Devotion, more Charity in their Religion, and more Piety in their Conver&s;ation than at pre&s;ent they do.</P>
<P>When I was vi&s;ited &s;ome Time ago by the cha&s;ti&s;ing Hand of the Lord for Sin, and my Di&s;obedience to his holy Will, I laboured under great Afflic|tion of Mind and Angui&s;h of Spirit; and tho' I was con&s;tant above many in my Attendance on the publick Prayers of the Church, &s;trict in my Ob|&s;ervation of its Ceremonies, and exceeding frequent in the U&s;e of private Devotion, yet my Barden encrea&s;ed, and I waxed wor&s;e.</P>
<P>In this wretched and doleful Condition I was, when at a Relation's Hou&s;e, who had providentially returned from <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to his native Country, I lighted upon <HI>R. Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lay's Apology for the Quakers;</HI> by the Reading whereof I was &s;o we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l per&s;uaded of their Principles, and by turning my Mind inward to the divine G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t, (according to their D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">trine) it gave me Victory in a great Mea&s;ure, over our common Enemy, bani&s;hed away my di&s;orderly Imaginations, and re&s;tored me to my former Regularity: I re|ceived &s;uch Satisfaction and Comfort to my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul, that thereupon I left the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and joined my &s;elf in Society with them; and I am the more confirmed in my Change, e&s;pecially where it re&s;pects the Wor&s;hip of our Creator, becau&s;e it is not only the mo&s;t agreeable to the Scriptures of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">John iv 23, 24.

<P>I hope none will begrudge me this Mercy, becau&s;e I received it not by their Mini&s;try; if they do, I have Cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect their Charity is not of a Chri&s;tian Latitude, &s;ince our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer approved not of that Nar|rowne&s;s in his Di&s;ciples in &s;omewhat a like Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But here to obviate the Objection &s;ome may make to my Change, be|cau&s;e of the Di&s;tre&s;s I lay under, and the Di&s;compo&s;ure I was &s;ubject to at Times, I would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> remark'd, that I read the &s;aid Apology be|yond my Expectation, with more Sedatene&s;s than u&s;ual, and a more quiet Compo&s;ure of Mind: So that with the Influence of the Almighty, or Pro|vidence, or both, I had al&s;o the Benefit of that di&s;tingui&s;hing Faculty of Man in the Change of my Opinion. O that I may never forget the Lord's Mercy to my Soul, who had Compa&s;&s;ion on me when I wallowed in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lood, and who &s;aid to the dry Bones, Live. O that all &s;uch as are vi&s;ited by the cha&s;ti&s;ing Hand of their Maker, would &s;eriou&s;ly lay it to Heart, and con&s;ider their own Welfare and Salvation; I could with with all my Heart, that &s;uch who labour under this Anxiety of Mind, would take Encou|ragement to hope in the Lord's Mercy thro' their ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, by his Kindne&s;s and long Forbearance with me. I am a living Monument of it now; and I hope I &s;hall be &s;o, while he affords me a Being here. If the&s;e Lines &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uld come to the Hands of any that are afflicted and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed as I was, I have an effectual Remedy, thro' Mercy, to pre&s;cribe unto them; Turn your Minds inward to the Grace of God in your own Hearts, re|frain from your own Imaginations, be &s;till, and quietly re&s;ign your &s;elves to his holy Will, &s;o you &s;hall and Health to your Souls, Refre&s;hm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt to your Spirits, and the &s;weet Con&s;olation of the Lord in your own B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;oms; you &s;hall find your Mourning turned to Gladne&s;s, and your Heavine&s;s to Joy; this has been my Experience of the Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dne&s;s of the Holy One of

<P>As for renouncing the Covenant which I and every Chri&s;tian ought to be under, of for&s;aking the Devil and all his Works, I am &s;o far from enter|taining one Thought of neglecting that Duty, that I think my &s;elf wholly obliged to ob&s;erve it: And if I &s;hould affirm, that thro' the Grace of God, and his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, (for otherwi&s;e I am &s;atisfied I cannot do it,) the Ob|&s;ervation of it is po&s;&s;ible, I can find no Rea&s;on why it &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e fal&s;e Do|ctrine in a <HI>Quaker,</HI> more than in a Church-man.</P>
<P>As for De&s;erting the Church and Mini&s;try which the Son of God came down from Heaven to e&s;tabli&s;h, I am not con&s;cious to my &s;elf thereof; for I &s;ay, Chri&s;t him&s;elf is the Head of our Church, and by his Spirit and Grace the Ordainer of our Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>And as to the la&s;t Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry my ingenious Acquaintance is plea&s;ed to pro|po&s;e, I do let him know, that my former De&s;pair and forlorn Condition has been, &s;ince my adhering to that reproached People, changed into a &s;weet Enjoyment of the Goodne&s;s of God. I could not conceal the Lord's Goodne&s;s, left he &s;hould withdraw his Mercies from me.</P>
<P>I had no &s;ecular Intere&s;t to corrupt me in this Change, it is apparent to many, I declined it; but as it was Peace with God my Maker, and Mercy to my Soul I wanted; &s;o having found the Pearl of great Price among them, I parted with all to purcha&s;e it; or rather I was re&s;tored to all, I mean, the Enjoyment of the Divine Goodne&s;s, and of my &s;elf, by &s;etting a due Value upon it.</P>

<P>The Animo&s;ities mention'd in this Addre&s;s, did regard the Divi&s;ion, which having been a good while among the Subjects, began to encrea&s;e, as many thought by the Change of the Mini&s;try. But this being out of my Province, I won't meddle with it.</P>
<P>In the Year 1712 died <HI>Richard Cromwel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1712 <HI>Death of</HI> R. Cromwel</NOTE> the Son of <HI>Oliver</HI> the Pro|tector, about the Age of ninety Years. Great Changes this Man had &s;een, having him&s;elf been the &s;upreme Ruler of <HI>England,</HI> as hath been mention'd in due Place.</P>
<P>Altho' I do not intend to relate much more of any Occurrences, becau&s;e I ha&s;ten towards a Conclu&s;ion, yet I think it worth the while to add the following Ca&s;e;</P>
<P>In the Year 1713,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1713 Ju&s;tice <HI>Penry</HI> pro&s;ecuted on the Act again&s;t Occa&s;ional Con|formity.</NOTE> in the Spring, there was a Suit at Law; on the Act again&s;t <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity.</HI> It happened that one <HI>John Penry,</HI> a Ju&s;tice of Peace of <HI>Ailborough,</HI> in the County of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> going to the Pari&s;h Church, under&s;tood by the Way, that no Service was to be done there at that Time; but hearing that there was a <HI>Quakers</HI> Meeting there, he went to it. One <HI>Wall,</HI> the Bailiff of the Place, being informed there|of, imagined that the &s;aid Ju&s;tice might not go there, becau&s;e of the afore&s;aid Act, and therefore thinking that &s;omething might be gained by it, got Witne&s;&s;es to declare that the &s;aid Ju&s;tice had been in the Meeting; and &s;aid afterwards in a boa&s;ting Way to him, <HI>Now I have book'd you.</HI> To which the other reply'd, <HI>I'll &s;tand to it.</HI> The Bailiff then entered his Suit in the Name of one that lived thereabouts by Cha|rity. When the Ca&s;e was pleaded at the Se&s;&s;ions, the Judge, who was Baron <HI>Salath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el Lovel,</HI> declared the Meaning of the fore-mentioned Act to be thus, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That it did not regard any who accidentally went into a Meeting of Di&s;&s;enters; but that it was again&s;t tho&s;e who con|formed with the Church, thereby to qualify them&s;elves for an Office, without changing their Religion.</Q> But this was Quite another Ca&s;e; for the Prie&s;t of the Pari&s;h him&s;elf, gave a Certificate that the &s;aid Ju&s;tice was a good Member of the Church.

<P>In the next Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1714</NOTE> being that of 1714, the Queen was often ill, and there was much Divi&s;ion among the People: For a Bill was brought into Parliament called, <HI>An Act to prevent the Growth of Schi&s;m;</HI> and the Party that prevailed then was very active to get this Bill pa&s;s'd.

<P><HI>G.

<P>This Speech was favourably heard by the Prince.</P>
<P>It was not long after the King's coming over,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury.</HI></NOTE> that Dr. <HI>Gilbert Bur|net,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> the renowned Author of the Hi&s;tory of the Reformation in <HI>England,</HI> died.

<PB N="683" REF="003104_0694_0FEFF9A4398E40C0">
it was re&s;olved, that a Bill &s;hould be brought in to prolong that &s;aid Term; and on the 7th of the &s;aid Month a Bill was accordingly brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">being near ex|pired, the &s;ame is perpetuated, and extended to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the <HI>American</HI> Plantations for five Years.</NOTE> read the fir&s;t Time, and five Days after, the &s;econd Time, and committed. And whereas the former Act was limited to a Term of Years, this Limitation was omitted now, and con&s;equently the Act was to be perpetual. The Bill thus far advanced, was at length engro&s;&s;ed, and on the &s;econd of the Month called <HI>June,</HI> after a third Reading, pa&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and was &s;ent to the Lords, from whence it was &s;ent back with this Addition, That this Favour &s;hould be extended al&s;o to the Northern Part of <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI> known by the Name of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to the Plantations belonging to the Crown of <HI>Great Britain</HI> for five Years (for &s;o far the former Act had not reach'd) and to the End of next Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament.</P>
<P>This Amendment was agreed to by the Hou&s;e of Commons on the 13th of the &s;aid Month, and on the la&s;t of that Month it was confirm|ed by the Royal A&s;&s;ent.

<P><HI>The Lord our God, who for the Sake of his Heritage hath often here|tofore rebuked and limited the raging Waves of the Sea, hath, ble&s;&s;ed be his Name, mercifully di&s;per&s;ed the Cloud threatning a Storm, which lately &s;eemed to hang over us; which together with the Favour God hath given us in the Eyes of the King, and the Government, for the free Enjoyment of our Religious and Civil Liberties, call for true Thankfulne&s;s to him.

<P>By the Accounts brought up this Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends Suf|ferings.</NOTE> We find that <HI>Friends</HI> Suf|ferings in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> amount to <HI>five Thou&s;and two Hundred and Ninty</HI> Pounds and upwards, chiefly for <HI>Tythes, Prie&s;ts Wages,</HI> and <HI>Steeple-Hou&s;e Rates;</HI> and that notwith&s;tanding there have been <HI>four Friends</HI> di&s;charged the la&s;t Year, there yet remain <HI>twenty Friends</HI> Pri&s;oners on the&s;e Accounts.</P>

<P><HI>IN the</HI> Preface <HI>to this Hi&s;tory, Mention is made of a certain Book intituled,</HI> The Light upon the Candle&s;tick, <HI>publi&s;hed in the Name (as many &s;uppo&s;ed) of</HI> William Ames, <HI>yet no ways writ by him, tho' it con|tains his Doctrine, but by a certain Learned Man, unwilling to be known publickly, and as it &s;eems to me writ originally in</HI> Latin; <HI>which, tho' printed, being in but few Hands, I have thought fit to reprint.</HI></P>
<P>And the Original in <HI>Latin</HI> &s;oon after the fir&s;t Publication being tran&s;lated into <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by <HI>B. F.</HI> was printed in the Year <HI>1663,</HI> from which Tran&s;|lation take it as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="excerpt from book">
<HEAD>The Light upon the Candle&s;tick.</HEAD>
<P>THings are not for Words, but Words for Things: If therefore we under&s;tand Things aright, and as they ought, by Words, it mu&s;t be by &s;uch as are fit to imprint the Things them&s;elves in tho&s;e to whom they &s;hould occur, and then it were enough (to make known our Thoughts to others as we conceive them) only to make u&s;e of &s;uch Words.</P>
<P>But fora&s;much as we find the Matter in this Ca&s;e far otherwi&s;e, and that two Men &s;peaking or writing the &s;ame Words, may neverthele&s;s have different, yea, &s;ometimes contrary Thoughts, the Di&s;ability of performing this fitly by Words or Di&s;cour&s;e is clearly inferred. Nor may we at all wonder at it, &s;eeing we know to what a perpetual Change Languages are &s;ubject, even &s;uch, that the very Words may be changed from their pri&s;tine Signification. And the Imperfection is &s;o great, that who&s;oever &s;hould have invented them, &s;uch as now they are in U&s;e, we &s;hould certainly believe that he had little or no Knowledge of tho&s;e Things that are thereby intended to be &s;ignified. So that if we would better expre&s;s Things unto another by Words and Speeches, we had need find new Words, and con&s;equently a whole new Language: But that would be a Toil and Labour indeed.</P>
<P>In the mean while we &s;ee what a Sea of Confu&s;ion flows from hence upon all Mankind: For altho' there &s;hould be none, who &s;ometimes through Ignorance, and &s;ometimes by Subtilty or Wickedne&s;s might wre&s;t or pervert Words contrary to the Mind of the Speaker or Writer, in &s;uch Manner as them&s;elves that &s;o do &s;hould think be&s;t for their own Ends, from whence con&s;equently all this Deceit, Slandering, Contention, and the like proceeds; yet &s;o it is, that how uprightly or prudently &s;o|ever a Man goes to Work in this Matter, he neverthele&s;s finds him&s;elf liable to mi&s;lead, or to be mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed.</P>
<P><PB N="689" REF="003104_0700_0FEFF9F149CEFC80">But although the Ca&s;e be thus with Words and Di&s;cour&s;es at pre|&s;ent in U&s;e, yet for all that, they are the mo&s;t ready, and &s;o far as I know, the fitte&s;t Means to make known all our Thoughts unto others by: And for this Rea&s;on therefore, tho' &s;o much Confu&s;ion and Deceit happen to ari&s;e from hence, that no Man that hath any Experience can be ignorant thereof: Yet may we not (therefore) be too much afraid of them neither, as many yet do manife&s;t them&s;elves to be, who be|cau&s;e they have &s;ome Experience hereof, are apt to believe we are a|bout to deceive them, e&s;pecially if they be but forewarned thereof.</P>
<P>This, as in many Things, &s;o it hath chiefly taken Place in that which is commonly e&s;teemed for Religion: In which 'tis &s;o with mo&s;t Men, that they will &s;carce give Audience to, much le&s;s take into Con|&s;ideration any Thing held forth unto them, by any whom they judge not to be of their own Opinion, as they imagine, to avoid being thereby deluded.</P>
<P>Yet if they were thus towards their own Party, we might think it was an Act of Prudence, and that they would &s;ee with their own Eyes: But no, in no wi&s;e, this is too hard a Task: What&s;oever cometh on that Side, is received with &s;uch Partiality for good and current Coin, as if there were no Danger nor Po&s;&s;ibility of Erring: Whereas neverthele&s;s it is all alike with the one as with the other Opinion. It all depends but upon a Po&s;&s;ibility of being neare&s;t to the Truth; And for the up|holding every one his own Opinion, and defending it again&s;t others, there is &s;o much ado, &s;o much Pains taken, &s;o much Schola&s;tick Learn|ing, Study and Di&s;puting, that one would rather believe that there were no true Religion at all, than that this &s;hould needs be it.</P>
<P>Seeing then 'tis thus at pre&s;ent, can we much blame the Common People, that they de&s;pair of ever being able to &s;olve this Difficulty, and are glad when they can but find any that are greedy of the Work, upon whom they may ca&s;t the whole Burthen? Surely no: For he that &s;ees but a little clearly, &s;ees, that there is always Contention behind, and no End till a Man grows weary of it: Nor is the Conque&s;t ju&s;t his that hath Truth, but that can be&s;t handle his Tongue. A mi&s;erable Thing if it were thus to be fought and found! But it is not &s;o with the True Religion.</P>
<P>Go to then, O Man, whoever thou art, we will not draw thee off from one Society of Men, to carry thee over unto another, 'tis &s;ome|what el&s;e we invite thee to. Lend us but a little Audience: Surely thou knowe&s;t thus much, That as it is an Extremity to receive all Things without Di&s;tinction, that pre&s;ent them&s;elves to us; &s;o 'tis no le&s;s to reject all Things without Judgment. We invite thee to &s;omething which may be a Means whereby to attain to thy own Salvation and Well-being: Be as di&s;tru&s;tful, or rather prudent or fore&s;ighted as thou wilt, thou can&s;t not in Rea&s;on refu&s;e us thy Ear in this Thing: All the Damage thou can&s;t po&s;&s;ibly have by doing that which we exhort thee to, is only to have taken a little Pains in vain, if that which is promi&s;ed &s;hould not &s;ucceed: Whereas on the contrary, if it &s;hould &s;ucceed, thou maye&s;t come to the Enjoyment of a Matter of &s;o great Worth, that would not be exchanged for all that is e&s;teemed great in the Earth. Moreover, 'tis not far to &s;eek, but at hand, 'tis <HI>nigh</HI> thee, yea and in thy &s;elf. And there thou maye&s;t experience the Trial of that which we declare, which is the mo&s;t certain and &s;ure that can be de&s;ired.</P>
<P>We direct thee then to <HI>within thy &s;elf,</HI> that is, that thou oughte&s;t to turn into, to mind and have Regard unto that which is <HI>within thee,</HI> to wit, <HI>The Light of Truth, the true Light which enlighteneth every Man that cometh into the World.</HI> Here 'tis that thou mu&s;t be, and not <HI>without</HI> thee. Here thou &s;halt find a Principle certain and infallible,
<PB N="690" REF="003104_0701_0FEFF9F55958E440">
and whereby encrea&s;ing and going on therein, thou maye&s;t at length ar|rive unto a happy Condition: Of this thou may&s;t &s;afely adventure the Trial, But it thou dare&s;t not do &s;o much, 'tis hard to help thee. And if thou happene&s;t to be one of tho&s;e that would&s;t it know all Things, be|fore thou do&s;t begin, yea, even tho&s;e Things which are experienced in a Condition to which thou art &s;o much a Stranger, that there's nothing in thee hath &s;o much Agreement therewith, as to comprehend it ac|cording to Truth: Know this, Thou do&s;t (therein) ju&s;t as tho&s;e that would learn to Read, without knowing the Letters.</P>
<P>To de&s;ire to know all Things that we are capable of, is good and laud|able: But to go further, is Folly. There will be always &s;omething el&s;e to ask, and our Knowledge will ever be too &s;hort. He that will not adventure till he be fully &s;atisfied, &s;hall never begin, much le&s;s fini&s;h it to his own Salvation.</P>
<P>But we judge it needful, as much as in us lies, to open unto you that unto which we do exhort you, that People may under&s;tand what it properly is.</P>
<P>We &s;ay then, That we exhort every ene to turn in to the <HI>Light</HI> that is in him, (We give it rather the Appellation of <HI>Light,</HI> than any Thing el&s;e, otherwi&s;e it is all one to us whether ye call it <HI>Chri&s;t, the Spirit, the Word,</HI> &amp;c. &s;eeing the&s;e all denote but one and the &s;ame Thing:) Yet the Word <HI>Light</HI> being in its natural Signification &s;omewhat el&s;e than that which we intend thereby, we &s;hall therefore in brief endeavour clearly to expre&s;s what we intend under this Denomination,</P>
<P><HI>The Light</HI> (then we &s;ay) <HI>is a clear and di&s;tinct Knowledge of Truth in the Under&s;tanding of every Man, by which he is &s;o convinced of the Being and Quality of Things, that he cannot po&s;&s;ibly doubt thereof.</HI></P>
<P>From this Definition which is here given of the <HI>Light,</HI> 'tis clear, that it mu&s;t needs comprehend in it the principal Effect of &s;hewing us, and giving us the Knowledge of what is <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Fal&s;hood,</HI> what is <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Evil;</HI> which verify is a Matter of &s;o great Concernment, that with|out it Men mu&s;t needs &s;werve up and down in continual Darkne&s;s. Opi|nion and Sin, neither knowing Truth at all, nor doing any Good, but gropingly, by hap-hazard, without any Certainty.</P>
<P><HI>This Light then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Light as to Man, what it is, defined.</NOTE> Chri&s;t, the Truth,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>is that which makes manife&s;t and reproves Sin in Men, &s;hewing him how he is &s;trayed from God, ac|cu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Evil which he doth, and both committed; yea, this is it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and condemneth him.</HI> Again,</P>
<P><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is the Preaching to every Creature under Heaven, tho' they have never read or heard of the Scripture.

<P>Moreover, &s;eeing it is properly the Nature of this<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Effect put for the Cau&s;e</NOTE> <HI>Light</HI> infallibly to di&s;cover Sin and Evil, <HI>to reprove and convince thereof; it can never po&s;&s;ibly con&s;ent thereunto.</HI> And altho' it be true indeed, that the Ope|rations of the <HI>Light</HI> are not in all Men alike powerful, in whom it is neverthele&s;s; yea (though) in &s;ome Men (it) &s;eems to have no Ope|ration at all: Yet this is occa&s;ioned only by tho&s;e Impediments that do hinder it: For as the <HI>Natural Light</HI> by the Interpo&s;ition of other Bodies of Covers, may be hindered from having its Operation there where el&s;e it would, were tho&s;e Things which impede removed, the <HI>Light</HI> (it &s;elf) &s;till abiding in its &s;elf unchanged; even &s;o it is al&s;o with this <HI>Light</HI> whereof we &s;peak. The Lett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in this are manifold. All what&s;oever we meet with in this World &s;eems to proclaim War in this Ca&s;e. What is there that hath not a powerful Operation upon one or other of the Sen&s;es of Man, thro' which pa&s;&s;ing over into the
<PB N="691" REF="003104_0702_0FEFF9F82BA99CC0">
Soul, the Memory is &s;o filled, that nothing el&s;e can enter. The Eyes and Ears &s;tand &s;o perpetually open to all Things, that they never want an Object to bring to Mind the Experience of that which plea&s;ed the Body &s;o well; And this &s;tirs up the De&s;ire to enjoy it, yet all Without Satiety: The Objects they are multifarious, the Enjoyment can be but &s;ingle and tran&s;ient, and the Cau&s;es ince&s;&s;ant.</P>
<P>Now where this operateth in us after this Manner, by Education and Example in Manners and Cu&s;toms which are regulated by Opinion, and not by the <HI>True Light,</HI> that Men live altogether therein; is it any Won|der that here (in the&s;e Men) there is &s;o little, or no Operation of the <HI>Light?</HI> Not at all.</P>
<P>We are &s;o involved into the De&s;ire of that which is high in the World, &s;o overwhelmed in Plea&s;ures, that it's almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for the <HI>Light</HI> to cau&s;e one De&s;ire after <HI>Good</HI> to &s;pring or bubble up.</P>
<P>Where then the&s;e &s;o contrary Operations to the <HI>Light</HI> are, there it can never break through.</P>
<P>According to the Nature and Kind of every Thing, is the Operation thereof: Where they are oppo&s;ite, the one mu&s;t give way unto the o|ther, and that which is mo&s;t powerful prevails: from whence al&s;o the Effects thereof become mo&s;t vi&s;ible. The LIGHT notwith&s;tanding, abides always the &s;ame, and therefore altho' Man by Sin, thro' his Love and Union to corruptible Things, comes to peri&s;h, be damned, and mi&s;s of his everla&s;ting Happine&s;s, the <HI>Light</HI> neverthele&s;s which is in <HI>every Man that comes into the World,</HI> abides forever unchangeable.</P>
<P><HI>The Light is al&s;o the fir&s;t Principle of Religion.</HI> For, &s;eeing there can be no true Religion without the Knowledge of God, and no Knowledge of God without this <HI>Light,</HI> Religion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have this <HI>Light</HI> for its Principle.</P>
<P>God being then known by this <HI>Light,</HI> according to the Mea&s;ure of Knowledge which the finite and circum&s;cribed Creature can have of the infinite and uncircum&s;criptible Creator, Man hath obtained a <HI>firm Foundation,</HI> upon which he may build all firm and la&s;ting Things: A Principle whereby he may without ever erring, guide the whole Cour&s;e of his Life, how he is to carry him&s;elf towards God, his Neighbour, and him&s;elf, and all Things el&s;e, whereby he may happily attain unto his Soul's Salvation, which con&s;i&s;teth only in <HI>Union with God.</HI> And thus this <HI>Light</HI> is therefore the fir&s;t Principle of Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Without this Light, there is no Power or Ability at all in M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to do any Good.</HI></P>
<P>This mu&s;t fir&s;t rai&s;e him and quicken him out of the Death of Sin. 'Tis Folly to expect any thing, Where nothing is; there's no Effect with out a Cau&s;e: There mu&s;t be &s;omething then which mu&s;t cau&s;e a Man to act, if he does any Thing.</P>
<P>And this Cau&s;e mu&s;t have in it what&s;oever the Effect produced hath in it: As for Example, if the Effects of <HI>Light</HI> be produced, <HI>Light</HI> mu&s;t do it, and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>And therefore, is it not a &s;illy Thing that all Men would have People do this or that as Good, and leave this or that as Evil, becau&s;e they tell them &s;o, without any more ado, or at be&s;t a&s;&s;igning only the accu&s;to|mary Motives wherefore, and think they have Rea&s;on too, ju&s;t as if this were enough? Who can &s;ee &s;uch Effects as are hereby required, included in this Cau&s;e? Not I, for my Part.</P>
<P>Experience al&s;o teacheth us the &s;ame; el&s;e how could it all pa&s;s a|way in a Train and Cu&s;tom, without any Fruit? <HI>The&s;e are therefore not the right Means:</HI> But &s;uch we mu&s;t endeavour to furni&s;h People with. Means from whence Power may i&s;&s;ue forth to do that which they are exhorted to. Such is the Nature of Man, that he is moved to chu&s;e
<PB N="692" REF="003104_0703_0FEFF9FA4BA00748">
that which he judgeth to be be&s;t, before the wor&s;t, and is always wil|ling to change for the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Now if it &s;o happens (as for the mo&s;t Part it doth) that a Man chu|&s;eth the wor&s;t before the be&s;t, 'tis for want of Knowledge, and contrary to his Aim, and &s;o he erreth, not being led by the <HI>True Light.</HI></P>
<P>Here then it &s;hould be begun; 'tis ea&s;ie leading a Man to that which of him&s;elf he is de&s;irous of: If tho&s;e now who make it their Work to teach others, <HI>were but led them&s;elves by the True Light,</HI> knowing better Things than tho&s;e to which the Multitude are link'd &s;o fa&s;t with Love, they would be able to hold them forth clearly to others: And &s;o making it their continual Work, it were impo&s;&s;ible their Labour &s;hould be fruitle&s;s; for People knowing better, would do better. Who remem|bers not the Play of our Youth, how much we were in Love therewith, and yet how ridiculous is it now unto us but to think upon it? And why? Becau&s;e we now know that which we judge better: <HI>Hence,</HI> not by Force, but very lightly, and of it &s;elf, they came from Time to Time to be worn out, and pa&s;s away, that there is now no De&s;ire nor Motion, moving thereunto. How may we think then it would be, if the Soul came but once to apprehend tho&s;e Things aright which are durable and uncorruptible, and which infinitely tran&s;cend all bodily Toys in Worth? So far as tho&s;e Things then &s;hould come to be e&s;teemed more glorious than all bodily Things, &s;o much the more powerful would be the Annihilation of tho&s;e Things in which all Men, even to old Age, yea, Death it &s;elf, do take &s;o much Delight; and then we might hope and expect that tho&s;e Things which are (indeed) alone worthy to be known, would gain Entrance, and being brought forth in the <HI>Light,</HI> would be al&s;o owned and received by every one, accord|ing to the Mea&s;ure in which they &s;hould &s;tand in the &s;ame <HI>Light.</HI></P>
<P>Hence from within, the Amendment and Conver&s;ion is to be waited for, from within it mu&s;t begin, if with a Foundation; the outward then will follow of it &s;elf: The Weake&s;t mu&s;t give way to the Stronge&s;t, all depends but upon the Knowledge of &s;omething better, to make a true and la&s;ting Change. Therefore to hold this forth to Men, is the be&s;t Thing we can give them.</P>
<P><HI>This Light is the Inward Ear, by which alone, and by no other, the Voice of God,</HI> viz. <HI>the Truth, can be heard.</HI></P>
<P>By this alone mu&s;t the Sen&s;e and Mind of him that would &s;ignifie any Thing by Words, or any outward Sign, be comprehended and un|der&s;tand. <HI>So that if the Truth of God</HI> be pre&s;ented to a Man who &s;tands not in the <HI>Light of Truth,</HI> 'tis impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould under&s;tand it, altho' he hears and comprehends the Words after his Manner, yet he is &s;till fenced off from the true Sen&s;e and Meaning thereof.</P>
<P>Hence therefore it is, that among &s;o many Hearers there are &s;o few that have Ears to hear.</P>
<P>He that hears <HI>Truth</HI> aright, that is, under&s;tands it well, mu&s;t not &s;tand out of, but in the <HI>Truth</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Therefore neither is it any Wonder that all Men do not under&s;tand and conceive tho&s;e Things that are brought forth by the <HI>Light.</HI> Tho&s;e only that &s;tand in it are alone (and no other) capable thereof.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e being thus, we &s;ee of how great Concernment it is conti|nually to exhort and excite Men to turn in to the <HI>Light</HI> that is in them, that &s;o they may go on to &s;uch a Condition and Mea&s;ure therein, as to be fit to under&s;tand aright <HI>the Word,</HI> that is, the <HI>Truth of God,</HI> becau&s;e out of this there can be nothing under&s;tood and concluded from the Words and Writings given forth from the <HI>Light,</HI> but meer Opinions, and con&s;equently Errors, <HI>This Light Chri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. is the <HI>Truth and Word of God,</HI> as hath been already &s;aid, and every where appears by what we
<PB N="693" REF="003104_0704_0FEFF9FDD30E0188">
have hitherto laid down: <HI>For this is a living Word, and tran&s;lateth Man from Death to Life, is powerful, and enableth a Man to hear witne&s;s of it every where.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This is al&s;o the true Rule according unto which all our Actions are to be &s;quared.</HI></P>
<P>This hath the Preheminence before any Writing, Scripture, Doctrine, or any Thing el&s;e that we meet with from without. <HI>We are born in|to the World,</HI> and brought up as every Body knows: From the very fir&s;t we hear Differences, every one pretends that he knows the Mat|ter, and hath Truth: One holds forth this, another That to us: <HI>If now the Light which is in every Man that comes into the World,</HI> &s;hall not be Judge, whither &s;hall we rowl? To believe all, is impo&s;&s;ible; to reject all, no le&s;s: Who &s;hall be judge here? Who el&s;e can be but the <HI>Light</HI> within us? For what&s;oever comes from without, is the Thing to be judged of: Who then fitter? &s;eeing this is infallible.</P>
<P>Again, is not this (the <HI>Light)</HI> that by which we mu&s;t &s;ee and know God, and &s;o con&s;equently that by which we mu&s;t judge all Things Di|vine? Certainly 'tis: Then it follows al&s;o, That we can judge of no Doctrine, of no Book that is Divine, but by this <HI>Light;</HI> and judging it thereby to be divine, it cannot but be truly &s;o. As for Example, if we experience that the Book called the BIBLE, in regard of tne Divine Doctrine therein compri&s;ed, hath &s;uch an <HI>Harmony with that in which God</HI> is known, that he mu&s;t needs have been the Author of it; there cannot rationally any more powerful Demon&s;tration be demanded. With them that are thus, <HI>the Scripture may become living and powerful, and not a dead Letter,</HI> as it mu&s;t needs be to tho&s;e Men who have no Feeling of this Thing. And from hence then it is apparent, &s;eeing this Light mu&s;t be preferred to all Things what&s;oever that we meet with from with|out, that then <HI>Man mu&s;t fir&s;t of all be directed to this:</HI> For without it what Profit is there (I pray) to be reaped any where by any external Sign but by it. Lay the Book of the Scripture freely before any Man, let him al&s;o have all the Fitne&s;s (the Univer&s;ities can give him) to look into it in its proper Language in which it may have fir&s;t been written, what will all be without the <HI>Light?</HI> Nothing. <HI>The Letters, the Words are not the Scriptures,</HI> but the Mind alone is the Scripture, and this Meaning can never be truly and ju&s;tly hit, but by tho&s;e alone that &s;tand in the &s;ame <HI>Light,</HI> out of which the Scriptures proceeded.</P>
<P>The&s;e are they then to whom the Scripture is a <HI>Co-witne&s;s,</HI> and as a Seal of their being Sons of God; while by Experience they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them|&s;elves, every one according to his Mea&s;ure, in the <HI>&s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in which the Saints formerly were,</HI> who &s;pake and writ all tho&s;e Things comprehended in the Book of the Scripture; <HI>the&s;e then have the true Under&s;tanding and Meaning of the Scriptures,</HI> not tho&s;e that <HI>imagine unto them&s;elves a Meaning</HI> by Opinion and Gue&s;s, thro' a thou&s;and Ima|ginations, without the lea&s;t A&s;&s;urance of not erring; which becomes the very Ground of all Jangling and Contention.</P>
<P>In fine, <HI>This Light in every Man is the Means to come to the Know|ledge of God.</HI> And &s;eeing all external Signs mu&s;t needs pre&s;uppo&s;e this Knowledge, therefore it&s;elf mu&s;t needs be immediate, without any ex|ternal Sign: That Signs mu&s;t pre&s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a Knowledge, is undeni|able: for the&s;e Signs mu&s;t either be <HI>Words or Effects, Works or Miracles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If Words,</HI> we &s;ee at fir&s;t an Impo&s;&s;ibility in the Thing it &s;elf: For <HI>Words are created and finite,</HI> and God who &s;hould make known him&s;elf by them, <HI>uncreated and infinite:</HI> And therefore here is &s;o infinite a Dif|ference, that there is no <HI>Manner</HI> of Agreement, nor any <HI>Thing</HI> in the Words by which they might be capable to do it. But again, if you fly to the <HI>Meaning</HI> of the Words, as being fit for &s;uch a Thing, then that which we &s;ay will more manife&s;tly appear: As put ca&s;e for Example|&s;ake,
<PB N="694" REF="003104_0705_0FEFFA019E385018">
that GOD about to make known him&s;elf by Words, &s;hould &s;ay, I AM GOD, and that this &s;hould be the Sign by which he would make him&s;elf known, we &s;ee clearly, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for a Man at fir&s;t to know God by this; For if he &s;hould comprehend any Thing out of the Sen&s;e of the Words, he mu&s;t needs formerly have had the Signification of the Word GOD, and what he is to under&s;tand by it: In like Manner, if God maketh his Will known to Man, <HI>the Knowledge of God</HI> (which hath its Original from the <HI>True Light) mu&s;t precede and convince him,</HI> that that (Manife&s;tation) can be from none but God alone, whereupon he is then &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured.</P>
<P>If by <HI>Effects</HI> (or <HI>outward miraculous Works)</HI> 'tis the &s;ame Thing; for the&s;e are no le&s;s <HI>created,</HI> no le&s;s <HI>finite:</HI> And tho' we might ob&s;erve &s;omething in the Nature of a Thing, which might be too difficult for the Power of any Creature, which we know, to effect; yet this at the utmo&s;t would be but a Demon&s;tration taken from our <HI>Impotency</HI> and not from <HI>the Nature and all the Operations of it;</HI> and this Kind of De|mon&s;tration cannot be certain and &s;table, till we were able clearly and di&s;tinctly to &s;ee that there was <HI>not a Concurrency of many Cau&s;es</HI> to pro|duce &s;uch an Effect, but that it mu&s;t needs have been cau&s;ed by an <HI>in|finite and unlimited Cau&s;e,</HI> whom we call God: But who knoweth this? Or who can declare it?</P>
<P>Add to this, <HI>That the Knwoledge of God in all Things mu&s;t fir&s;t be, be|fore the Knowledge of any Creature</HI> or particular Thing; &s;o that no par|ticular Thing without this can be well known; and con&s;equently is altogether uncapable to come to know God by, or certainly to make known him&s;elf to Man by.</P>
<P>Go to then, <HI>Without</HI> thy &s;elf, O Man, thou ha&s;t no Means to look for, by which thou maye&s;t know God. <HI>Thou mu&s;t abide within thy &s;elf, to the Light that is in thee</HI> thou mu&s;t turn thee, there thou wilt find it, And no where el&s;e.</P>
<P>God is, <HI>con&s;idered</HI> in him&s;elf, <HI>neare&s;t unto thee and every Man.</HI> He that goes forth of him&s;elf to any Creature, thereby to know God, de|parts from God, and &s;o much the further, an he comes more to admire the Creature, and &s;tand in Contemplation thereof, to mi&s;take him&s;elf by it, This thou mu&s;t then <HI>&s;hun</HI> and the contrary <HI>mind,</HI> viz. <HI>Mind the Light that is in thee,</HI> by it to work, unmoveably and faithfully to per&s;evere.</P>
