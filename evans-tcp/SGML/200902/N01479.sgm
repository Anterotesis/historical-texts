<P>IT is much to be de&s;ired; And how <HI>Sweet unto our Soul,</HI> would be the <HI>De&s;ire Accompli&s;hed!</HI> That the TA|BLE of the LORD, may be more <HI>Generally,</HI> and after the mo&s;t <HI>worthy manner</HI> Approach'd unto. The <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord, with His New-born Chil|dren, like <HI>Olive-plants</HI> about it, verily, Tis an <HI>Excellent Sight.</HI> Worthy Ap|proaches to the Table of the Lord, are <HI>Excellent Actions;</HI> and they have a Ten|dency to make <HI>Excellent Chri&s;tians.</HI> At the <HI>Table of the Lord,</HI> we do according to His Direction, Celebrate a very great <HI>Appointment</HI> and <HI>Sacrament</HI> of the <HI>New-Te&s;tament.</HI> There can be nothing more Plain and Po&s;itive, than that Order of our Saviour unto His Di&s;ciples; Luk. XXII. 19. <HI>This do in Remembrance of Me:</HI> Repeated by the Apo&s;tles of our Lord,
<PB N="4" REF="001759_0003_0FB7D255FA62F9C8">after He was <HI>Received up into Glory.</HI> [1 Cor.

But, how ju&s;tly does the Holy Lord, by permitting the <HI>Ri&s;ing</HI> &amp; <HI>Hi&s;&s;ing</HI> of &s;uch a Sect among them, Cha&s;ti&s;e His People, for neglecting the <HI>Ordinance</HI> which is decried and oppo&s;ed by the&s;e <HI>Gain&s;ayers!</HI> And, why, Oh! why, do &s;o many that are far from the <HI>Here&s;ies</HI> of that Sect, yet indulge them|&s;elves in the <HI>Mi&s;carriage,</HI> which one of their mo&s;t noted <HI>Here&s;ies</HI> does lead unto!</P>
<P>Our People generally confe&s;s, That it is their <HI>Duty,</HI> to draw near unto the Lord in this Holy, and Famous In&s;titu|tion.

<P>The common <HI>Apology</HI> made for this Omi&s;&s;ion is; <HI>I am afraid; I &s;hall come Un|worthily; and by doing &s;o, I &s;hall Eat and Drink Judgment unto my &s;elf.</HI> But verily, This will imply &s;omething that will hardly be capable of an <HI>Apology.</HI> Have you <HI>done,</HI> all that you <HI>can do,</HI> that you may not <HI>come Unworthily?</HI> If you have <HI>not,</HI> then you <HI>Stay away Unworthily.</HI> Tis

<P>Sirs, The <HI>Emba&s;&s;adors of Peace</HI> have cau&s;e, for <HI>Weeping bitterly</HI> over you.
<Q>What? Have we been Labouring &s;o many years, to bring our People Home unto their only Saviour; &amp; have all our pains been &s;o ineffectual,
<PB N="8" REF="001759_0007_0FB7D25CFB1BA720">that not Half of our People have to this day come to tho&s;e <HI>Di&s;po&s;itions of Piety,</HI> upon which they may venture to the Table of the Lord?

<P>If this Con&s;ideration will make little Impre&s;&s;ion upon you, Oh! Look up to your only Saviour, and hear His Heart|breaking Expo&s;tulations.
<Q>What? Have my People &s;o little Regard unto the <HI>Remembrance</HI> of their <HI>Dying Saviour?</HI> Did I, when I was going to lay down My <HI>Life,</HI> on their behalf, ask them to keep <HI>Alive</HI> the Memory of what I have done for them, in a <HI>Sacramental Commemoration</HI> of it; and will they Forget My <HI>La&s;t Will and Te&s;tament?</HI> Do I give them a Precious Opportu|nity of <HI>Communion</HI> with Me, wherein <HI>One Hour is better than a thou&s;and el&s;e|where;</HI> and are they &s;o intangled in the Lu&s;ts of this World, that they

<P>But that which I &s;hould rather pro|ceed unto, is; To Set before you, the <HI>Preparation,</HI> which you are to make, that you may not <HI>Come Unworthily</HI> unto the <HI>Table of the Lord.</HI> Having &s;een your &s;elves <HI>Unable</HI> to do any thing, &amp; <HI>Unworthy</HI> that God &s;hould enable you, Lift up a cry to <HI>Sovereign Grace,</HI> that you may be enabled. <HI>O Thou from whom is the Preparation of the Heart in Man, Grant, Grant unto me, the Preparati|on of thy Sanctuary!</HI></P>
<P>And now;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t; You are to Set before you, the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> in all the Propo&s;als of it; and Expre&s;s and Renew the Compliance of your Souls, with all that is Propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Demand of the Great GOD, is; <HI>Peri&s;hing Sinner, Shall I be thy God, and thy Portion? Wilt thou take me for thy Fa|ther, thy Saviour, thy Leader? Shall it be thy chief Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, to Enjoy me, and to be Employ'd for me? Art thou Willing and
<PB N="10" REF="001759_0009_0FB7D26526DA2EA8">Re&s;olved, for ever to depend on my Je&s;us for every Good Thing and follow His Con|duct unto the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s He has purcha&s;ed and Prepared for His People?</HI> Now let the An&s;wer of your very Souls within you, be; <HI>Lord, I am Willing; Thou ha&s;t made me Willing!</HI> This 'tis to come into the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God. Having <HI>Truly</HI> done this you may <HI>Safely</HI> come, &amp; <HI>Seal</HI> the <HI>Covenant;</HI> Come, and Ratify your <HI>Act</HI> and <HI>Deed. This</HI> is your <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> at the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord. Your coming thi|ther, mu&s;t be on this very <HI>Account;</HI> it is for <HI>this</HI> that you are called unto it.</P>
<P>Secondly. You mu&s;t behold a <HI>Sa|crificed Saviour;</HI> the <HI>Lamb of God!</HI> and make a <HI>fre&s;h Application</HI> to the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of your <HI>Saviour.</HI> Affect your &s;elves with the view of your <HI>Sins,</HI> and of the <HI>Plagues</HI> to which you are Expo&s;ed by your <HI>Sins;</HI> and then, the Provi&s;ion which God has made, in the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of your <HI>Saviour,</HI> that your Sins may be all Forgiven you. Own, you <HI>Need</HI> &s;uch a <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> and Renounce all Hopes, but in <HI>That</HI> alone; and Admire the Favour of God that has provided &s;uch a <HI>Sacri|fice</HI> for you, and allow'd you to <HI>Plead</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="001759_0010_0FB7D2655E2EE208">it as your Atonement. Humbly Re|mon&s;trate; <HI>O Holy God, Thy Chri&s;t has been made a Sacrifice for my Sin. Infinite|ly do I want &s;uch a Sacrifice. I de&s;pair of of all Help from any other. I pre&s;ent that mo&s;t valuable Sacrifice before thee, and be|&s;eech thee for the &s;ake thereof to be Recon|ciled unto me.</HI> When you have Truly done this, you may Safely come, &amp; put in your <HI>Claim</HI> for a Part in the Great Sacrifice. This is done by coming to the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord. It is to be the <HI>Intent</HI> and <HI>Language</HI> of your coming thither!</P>
<P>Thirdly. Tho' you may be di&s;cou|raged by the <HI>Defects</HI> which may &s;till attend the <HI>Work of Grace</HI> in your Souls, yet you mu&s;t feel the working of Ho|ly <HI>De&s;ires</HI> in your Souls, to have that work effectually carried on. A <HI>Work of Grace,</HI> lies in a Principle, inclining the Soul, <Q>To Fear God, and Prize Chri&s;t, and Hate all Sin, and Sleight this World, and Do all the Good we can to all about us, and Look and Long for the Felicities of the Hea|venly World.</Q> You mu&s;t be heartily
<PB N="12" REF="001759_0011_0FB7D266D437B478">de&s;irous, as to have a Real <HI>Experience</HI> of this <HI>Work,</HI> &s;o to have it carried <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> unto <HI>Perfection.</HI> The <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord has been Spread, for the nouri&s;hment of this Glorious <HI>Work.</HI> The Per&s;on who is heartily <HI>De&s;irous,</HI> to have this Work nouri&s;hed in him will be wel|come to the <HI>Holy Table.</HI> The <HI>Good Things</HI> here, are for that <HI>Hungry</HI> and <HI>Thir&s;ty</HI> Soul. Ah Soul above all things de&s;irous to have the <HI>Image of God and His Chri&s;t</HI> brought unto <HI>Perfection</HI> in thee; Soul de&s;irous to be clean&s;ed from <HI>all Filthine&s;s of Fle&s;h and Spirit,</HI> and brought unto <HI>Perfection of Holine&s;s;</HI> The Great King will &s;ay, <HI>Welcome to my Ho|ly Table; I have put a Wedding Garment on that Soul. The &s;en&s;e it has of its own Rags does be&s;peak a Wedding Garment for it.</HI></P>
<P>In the&s;e things, there lies that which we call, An <HI>Habitual Preparation</HI> for the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord. There is an <HI>Actual Preparation</HI> al&s;o to be <HI>Endeavoured.</HI> And in order to this, A <HI>Time</HI> is to be &s;et a|part for it, a little before your coming. You mu&s;t not begrutch <HI>Time</HI> for &s;uch
<PB N="13" REF="001759_0012_0FB7D26BB712B588">a weighty and awful affair. Shake off your Secular Encumbrances, and com|mand &s;o much <HI>Time,</HI> as is requi&s;ite for the bringing of your Souls, into an <HI>Heavenly Temper.</HI></P>
<P>Now, In your <HI>Actual Preparation,</HI> One thing is to be this; You mu&s;t ac|tually go over again the Poincs of your <HI>Habitual Preparation. Actually</HI> On each of tho&s;e <HI>Three Things</HI> over again; by which you will make it &s;ure, That you have <HI>Really done</HI> them. No Proof like this; You be&s;t prove that you <HI>have done</HI> the <HI>Things that accempany Salvation,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Doing</HI> of them.</P>
<P>But then, another thing of great con&s;equence to be now attended is, A <HI>Self-Examination.</HI> So tis required, 1 Cor. XI. 28. <HI>Let a man Examine him|&s;elf, and &s;o let him Eat of that Bread, and Drink of that Cup.</HI> In the management of your <HI>Self-Examination,</HI> Fir&s;t Implore the Help of God; <HI>Lord, Search me, Try me; &s;ee, and cau&s;e me to &s;ee, if there be a|ny way of Wickedne&s;s in me, and let not a Deceived Heart cau&s;e me to Peri&s;h with a Eye in my Right Hand.</HI> Then take the
<PB N="14" REF="001759_0013_0FB7D26E86E03930"><HI>Marks</HI> by which the <HI>Converts of Zion</HI> are to be di&s;tingui&s;hed; and <HI>Examine</HI> your &s;elves, how far tho&s;e <HI>Marks</HI> are to be found upon you. Put the <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> to your &s;elves, and let not your Hearts put you off, without a Satisfactory <HI>An|&s;wer</HI> to it.</P>
<P>Enquire;
<Q>Is a Glorious CHRIST mo&s;t acceptable to me in all His <HI>Offi|ces;</HI> and with all His <HI>Kindne&s;&s;es;</HI> and would I fain have Him to be <HI>All</HI> that unto me, which He is unto all the <HI>Heirs of &s;alvation?</HI> Do I rely on Him, as my <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and my <HI>Advo|cate,</HI> before the Righteous God; and al&s;o my <HI>Leader</HI> in the <HI>Paths of Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s?</HI> Do I &s;ee Him out &s;hining all <HI>Creatures</HI> in all their <HI>Beauties;</HI> and is it the Grand wi&s;h of my Soul, to be <HI>Con|formed</HI> unto Him? Does it un&s;peakably Plea&s;e me to <HI>Re&s;emble</HI> and <HI>Imitate</HI> Him, in all <HI>Vertuous Things?</HI> Yea, is it a Plea&s;ure al&s;o unto me, to &s;ee my &s;elf in <HI>Sufferings</HI> made like unto Him?</Q></P>
<P>Enquire;
<Q>Do I Look upon <HI>Sin,</HI> as the <HI>Wor&s;t of Evils?</HI> Has the contempt
<PB N="15" REF="001759_0014_0FB7D26FEA5B9120">which <HI>my Sin</HI> has offered unto <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Great GOD, been the inexpre&s;&s;ible Trouble of my Soul? Do I abhor e|very thing, that I take to be a <HI>Sin?</HI> Am I afraid of Indulging &s;o much as a <HI>Sinful Thought</HI> in my Mind? Have I cho&s;en <HI>Affliction</HI> rather than <HI>Sin;</HI> when I mu&s;t undergo <HI>that,</HI> for the Avoiding of <HI>Sin?</HI> And can I rejoyce in that <HI>Affliction,</HI> which I find Morti|fies my <HI>Sin,</HI> and prevents and pre|&s;erves me from falling into <HI>Sin?</HI></Q></P>
<P>Enquire; <Q>Does the Infinite GOD, appear in every Thing De&s;irable to me; in every thing, worthy to be <HI>Lo|ved,</HI> worthy to be <HI>Prai&s;ed?</HI> Have I Placed my chief <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> in an <HI>Ac|quaintance,</HI> and <HI>Fellow&s;hip</HI> with &s;uch a God; and in having His <HI>Favour;</HI> and in being u&s;ed in <HI>Service</HI> for Him; and in being brought where He &s;hall be <HI>All</HI> in <HI>All</HI> unto me? Is my <HI>Delight</HI> in tho&s;e things that bring me near unto Him? And is it my Study to ad|vance His <HI>Kingdom</HI> in the World?</Q></P>
<P>Enquire; <Q>Do I de&s;ire the Pro&s;perity of my <HI>Neighbours?</HI> Am I glad when
<PB N="16" REF="001759_0015_0FB7D27158BF4420">things go <HI>well</HI> with them; Griev'd when they go <HI>Ill?</HI> Is it my Endea|vour to <HI>Do Good</HI> unto them, who have <HI>Done Hurt</HI> unto me? And wherever I &s;ee in any of them the <HI>Piety,</HI> which intimates their being Related &amp; U|nited unto my <HI>Saviour,</HI> does this ve|ry &s;en&s;ibly Endear them to me? Do I <HI>Love</HI> them, as my <HI>Brethren;</HI> the <HI>Chil|dren of my Father?</HI></Q></P>
<P>Enquire;
<Q>Have I Renounced the <HI>Idols,</HI> by following of which the Un|godly are led into <HI>Perdition?</HI> Do I <HI>Deny</HI> my <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> every thing, that God has <HI>Forbid?</HI> Am I unwilling to <HI>Offend God,</HI> that I may <HI>Get</HI> any <HI>Thing,</HI> or <HI>Plea&s;e</HI> any <HI>Man,</HI> in this <HI>World?</HI> Is it my cour&s;e to re&s;i&s;t the <HI>Temptations</HI> of <HI>Satan,</HI> and reject them with De|te&s;tation?</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are the Things, after which your <HI>Self-Examination,</HI> is to be Inqui&s;i|tive. But I make &s;ome Remarks upon the Performance of this Excerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Tho' you do not, upon your <HI>Self-Examination,</HI> get beyond all Doubts and Fears, whether you have the&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="001759_0016_0FB7D27691F3CF58">things Really in you, yet you mu&s;t not be by the&s;e <HI>Doubts</HI> and <HI>Fears</HI> hindred from going on, and coming to the <HI>Ta|ble</HI> of the Lord. If you have any pre|ponderating <HI>Hopes</HI> that you <HI>have</HI> the&s;e Things, or cannot fairly and ju&s;tly Pronounce the <HI>Sentence,</HI> that you <HI>have them not;</HI> You may and &s;hould come. Come, as the Poor Woman, that came <HI>Trembling,</HI> to touch the Garment of our Saviour. Come and &s;ay, <HI>Lord, At thy Bidding I come. I dur&s;t not forbear, what thou ha&s;t bidden me to do.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. While you are in your <HI>Self-Examination,</HI> to Silence your <HI>Doubts</HI> and <HI>Fears,</HI> whether you have done the&s;e things or no, the be&s;t way is, not only to <HI>Ask</HI> whether you <HI>have done</HI> &s;uch things, but now to <HI>Do them.</HI> It is now a Sweet Sea&s;on to <HI>Do</HI> all that belongs to the <HI>New Creature;</HI> To <HI>Do it,</HI> over &amp; over again; The <HI>Doing</HI> of it, will render the <HI>Being</HI> of it Unque&s;tio|nable. Upon every Stroke &s;ay, <HI>Lord, Now I do this, if I never did it before!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. It is not only to be now Examined; <HI>Whether you have the Graces
<PB N="18" REF="001759_0017_0FB7D27A7258AC00">of a Regenerate Chri&s;tian?</HI> But it mu&s;t al|&s;o come into your Examination, <HI>What there is yet wanting in your Graces?</HI> You &s;hould Enquire, In what you are &s;till <HI>Defective?</HI> And from thence Prepare &s;ome <HI>Errand,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Reque&s;t,</HI> which you will carry unto the Table of the Lord; in order to the Relief of tho&s;e <HI>Defects,</HI> which are &s;till found upon you. Sirs, The <HI>Church</HI> is an <HI>Ho&s;pital;</HI> Tis to &s;omething like the Pool of <HI>Bethe&s;da</HI> that you are now approaching.

Having pa&s;&s;ed thro' this <HI>Preparation,</HI> I will now &s;et before you, The <HI>Worthy Manner</HI> of coming unto the <HI>Table of the Lord.</HI> It &s;hall be briefly recommended, in only Two In&s;tructions; <HI>We will put upon you none other Burden.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t. You mu&s;t behold the <HI>Sacramen|tal Elements,</HI> and the <HI>Sacramental Acti|ons;</HI> and affect your Hearts with &s;uita|ble and Heart melting <HI>Meditations</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>When you &s;ee the <HI>Bread,</HI> your Thoughts mu&s;t be on that <HI>Body which God Prepared</HI> for your Saviour, therein to make Him&s;elf a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and an <HI>Of|fering.</HI> When you &s;ee the <HI>Wine,</HI> your Thoughts mu&s;t be on that <HI>Blood of the Son of God, which clean&s;es from all Sin.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Bread</HI> is <HI>Taken</HI> by the Pa&s;|tor; and &s;o anon, when the <HI>Wine</HI> is <HI>Ta|ken,</HI> Your Thoughts mu&s;t be on that Subject; <HI>I &s;ee, I &s;ee, how the Son of God has taken our Nature; How the Word was made Fle&s;h!</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Bread</HI> is <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed;</HI> Your Thoughts are to be: <HI>Thus was my Je&s;us Con&s;ecrated, and &s;et apart for the Work of
<PB N="20" REF="001759_0019_0FB7D27E1C22F8F0">a Redeemer.</HI> And anon, when the <HI>Wine</HI> has <HI>Thanks given</HI> upon it; your Thoughts are to be: <HI>Oh! what Thanks, what Thanks do I owe for my Je&s;us!</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Bread</HI> is <HI>Broken;</HI> You are to think: <HI>Oh! what Griefs was my Je&s;us broken withal; when it plea&s;ed the Lord to brui&s;e Him, and put Him to Griefs! And He was brui&s;ed for our Iniquities!</HI> And anon, when you &s;ee the <HI>Wine</HI> has been poured into the Cup; You are to think: <HI>Oh! how was the Blood of my Je&s;us poured out, when his Soul was made a Tre&s;pa&s;s-offering!</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Bread</HI> is <HI>Given;</HI> You are to think: O <HI>my God, Wilt thou give thy Je&s;us to me! Yea, God bath &s;o Loved the World!</HI></P>
<P>When you <HI>Receive,</HI> the one fir&s;t, and anon the other; it &s;hould be with &s;uch Thoughts as the&s;e; <HI>O my dear</HI> JESUS, <HI>I receive thee, I receive thee; No longer will I deny thee an Entrance into my Soul; at the Door whereof thou art now Knock|ing; O my Lard, and my God!</HI></P>
<P>When you <HI>Eat</HI> the <HI>Bread,</HI> you are to Think, and wi&s;h; <HI>Oh! Let me be U|nited
<PB N="21" REF="001759_0020_0FB7D282ADB52430">unto my Je&s;us, and Strengthened by Him.</HI> When you <HI>Drink the Wine,</HI> You are to Think, and wi&s;h; <HI>Oh! Let the Blood of my Je&s;us be applied unto me, as Purcha&s;ing Life Eternal for me! Oh! Let the Spirit of my Je&s;us Enter me, and Po&s;|&s;e&s;s me, and Quicken me for ever-more.</HI></P>
<P>A Soul thus Engaged, is at a <HI>Fea&s;t of Fat things full of Marrow, of Wines on the Lees well refined.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. You may find Intervening <HI>Spaces</HI> while you are about this <HI>Work of the Lord,</HI> for to pro&s;ecute many <HI>Special De&s;igns</HI> of Godline&s;s, which would here have their mo&s;t Effectual Pro&s;ecution. There are Intervening <HI>Pau&s;es,</HI> whereof tis pity a moment &s;hould be lo&s;t. Now, it were <HI>all Wi&s;dom and Prudence in you,</HI> before your coming hither, to Shape &s;ome <HI>Holy De&s;igns,</HI> which you will come upon. Be&s;ides what the <HI>Sermons</HI> Preached on the&s;e Occa&s;ions may Lead you to think upon; you may aforehand ponder, <HI>What remarkable Deficiency in my Chri&s;tianity &s;hould I now &s;eek to have repaired?</HI> Or, <HI>What is the Di&s;temper in my Soul, that I will now go to the Lord
<PB N="22" REF="001759_0021_0FB7D28412182420">my Healer, for the Healing of?</HI> Or, <HI>What is the Temptation, with which I am now mo&s;t in Danger to find the Temp|ter too hard for me?</HI> At the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord, Look upon your Saviour, as fir&s;t <HI>Purcha&s;ing</HI> that Favour of God, which you are now pur&s;uing of. De|clare that you <HI>Receive</HI> what is before you, as a Yoken, that you <HI>Rely</HI> upon Him for that Favour. Then Look up|on your Saviour as on the Throne at the Right Hand of God, Able and Willing from thence to di&s;pen&s;e it un|to you. So go on expre&s;&s;ing the Reli|ance of your Soul upon Him, for that <HI>Favour</HI> in all the parts of it; Say, all that you would have; until you can conclude, <HI>Lord, All my De&s;ire is before thee, and my Groaning is not hid from thee.</HI></P>
