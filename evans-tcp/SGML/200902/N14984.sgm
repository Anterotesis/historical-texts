<HEAD>The WAY to Wealth, AND A PLAN by which every MAN MAY PAY HIS TAXES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>COURTEOUS READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE heard that nothing gives an author &s;o great plea&s;ure as to find his works re&s;pectfully quoted by others. Judge, then, how much I mu&s;t have been gratified by an incident I am going to relate to you. I &s;topped my hor&s;e lately, where a great number of people were collected at an auction of mer|chants goods. The hour of &s;ale not being come, they were conver&s;ing on the badne&s;s of the times, and one of the company called to a plain clean Old Man, with white locks,&mdash;<Q>Pray, <HI>Father Abraham,</HI> what think you of the times? Will not the&s;e heavy taxes quite ruin the country? How &s;hall we be ever able to pay them? What would you advi&s;e us to?</Q> Father Abraham &s;tood up, and replied, <Q>If you would have my advice, I will give it you in &s;hort, "for a word to the wi&s;e is enough," as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays.</Q> They joined in de|&s;iring him to &s;peak his mind, and gathering round him, he proceeded as follows:</P>
<P><Q>FRIEND, &s;ays he, the taxes are indeed very heavy; and if tho&s;e laid on by the go|vernment were the only ones we had to pay, we might more ea&s;ily di&s;charge them; but we have many others, and much more griev|ous to &s;ome of us. We are taxed twice as much by our idlene&s;s, three times as much by our pride, and four times as much by our folly; and from the&s;e taxes the commi&s;&s;ioners cannot ea&s;e or deliver us, by allowing an abatement. However, let us hearken to good advice, and &s;omething may be done for us; "God helps them that help them&s;elves," as Poor Richard &s;ays.</Q></P>
<P N="1">I. <Q>It would be thought a hard government that &s;hould tax its people one tenth part of their time, to be employed in its &s;ervice: but idlene&s;s taxes many of us much more; &s;loth, by bringing on di&s;ea&s;es, ab&s;olutely &s;hortens life. <Q>Sloth, like ru&s;t, con&s;umes fa&s;ter than labour wears, while the u&s;ed key is always bright,</Q> as Poor Richard &s;ays.&mdash; <Q>But do&s;t thou love life, then do not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> time, for that is the &s;tuff life is made of,</Q> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> is nece&s;&s;ary do we &s;pend in &s;leep; forgetting that <Q>The &s;leeping fox catches no poultry, and that there will be &s;leeping enough in the grave,</Q> as Poor Richard &s;ays.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If time be of all things the mo&s;t precious, wa&s;ting time mu&s;t be,</Q> as Poor Richard &s;ays, "the greate&s;t prodigality," &s;ince, as he el&s;e|where tells us, <Q>Lo&s;t time is never found again; and what we call time enough, al|ways proves little enough:</Q> Let us then up and be doing, and doing to the purpo&s;e; for by diligence we &s;hall do more with le&s;s per|plexity. <Q>Sloth makes all things difficult, but indu&s;try all ea&s;y; and, he that ri&s;eth late, mu&s;t trot all day, and &s;hall &s;carce overtake his bu&s;ine&s;s at night; while lazine&s;s travels &s;o &s;lowly, that poverty &s;oon overtakes him. Drive thy bu&s;ine&s;s, let not that drive thee; and early to bed, and early to ri&s;e, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wi&s;e,</Q> as Poor Richard &s;ays.</P>
<P><Q>So what &s;ignifies wi&s;hing and hoping for better times? We may make the&s;e times better, if we be&s;tir our&s;elves. <Q>Indu&s;try need not wi&s;h, and he that lives upon hope will die fa&s;ting. There are no gains with|out pains; then help hands, for I have no lands,</Q> or, if I have, they are &s;martly taxed. <Q>He that hath a trade, hath an e&s;tate; and he that hath a calling, hath an office of profit and honour,</Q> as Poor Richard &s;ays; but then the trade mu&s;t be worked at, and the calling well followed, or neither the e&s;tate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes. If we are indu&s;trious we &s;hall never &s;tarve; for, <Q>at the working man's hou&s;e hunger looks in, but dares not enter.</Q> Nor will the bailiff or the con&s;table enter, for, <Q>In|du&s;try pays debts, while de&s;pair encrea&s;eth them.</Q> What though you have found no trea&s;ure, nor has any rich relation left you a legacy, <Q>Diligence is the mother of good luck, and God gives all things to indu&s;try. Then plow deep, while &s;luggards &s;leep, and you &s;hall have corn to &s;ell and to keep.</Q> Work while it is called to-day, for you know not how much you may be hindered to-mor|row. <Q>One to-day is worth two to-mor|rows,</Q> as Poor Richard &s;ays; and farther, <Q>Never leave that till to-morrow, which you can do to-day.</Q>&mdash;If you were a &s;ervant, would you not be a&s;hamed that a good ma&s;ter &s;hould catch you idle? Are you then your own ma&s;ter? Be a&s;hamed to catch your&s;elf idle, when there is &s;o much to be done for your&s;elf, your family, and your coun|try.&mdash;Handle your tools without mit|tens; remember, that <Q>The cat in gloves catches no mice,</Q> as Poor Richard &s;ays. It is true, there is much to be done, and, perhaps, you are weak handed; but &s;tick to it &s;teadily, and you will &s;ee great effects; for <Q>Con&s;tant dropping wears away &s;tones; and by diligence and patience the mou&s;e ate in two the cable; and little &s;trokes fell great oaks.</Q></Q></P>
<P><Q>Methinks I hear &s;ome of you &s;ay, "Mu&s;t a man afford him&s;elf no lei&s;ure?" I will tell thee, my friend, what Poor Richard &s;ays; <Q>Employ thy time well, if thou meane&s;t to gain lei&s;ure, and, &s;ince thou art not &s;ure of a minute, throw not away an hour.</Q> <HI>Lei&s;ure</HI> is time for doing &s;omething u&s;eful; this lei|&s;ure the diligent man will obtain, but the lazy man never; for, <Q>A life of lei&s;ure, and a life of lazine&s;s are two things. Many, without labour, would live by their wits only, but they break for want of &s;tock;</Q> whereas indu&s;try gives comfort, and plenty, and re&s;pect. <Q>Fly plea&s;ures, and they will follow you. The diligent &s;pinner has a large &s;hift; and now I have a &s;heep and a cow, every body bids me good-morrow.</Q></Q></P>
<P N="2">II. <Q>But with our indu&s;try we mu&s;t likewi&s;e be &s;teady, &s;ettled, and careful, and over&s;ee our own affairs with our own eyes, and not tru&s;t too much to others; for as Poor Richard &s;ays,
<Q><L>"I never &s;aw an oft removed tree,</L>
<L>"Nor yet an oft removed family,</L>
<L>"That throve &s;o well as tho&s;e that &s;ettled be."</L></Q>
And again, <Q>Three removes is as bad as a fire,</Q> and again, <Q>Keep thy &s;hop, and thy &s;hop will keep thee;</Q> and again, <Q>If you would have your bu&s;ine&s;s done, go; if not; &s;end.</Q> And again,
<Q><L>"He that by the plough would thrive,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 line"></L></Q>
And again, <Q>The eye of a ma&s;ter will do more work than both his hands;</Q> and again, <Q>Want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge;</Q> and again, <Q>Not to over&s;ee workmen, is to leave them your pur&s;e open; tru&s;ting too much to others care is the ruin of many;</Q> for, <Q>In the affairs of this world, men are &s;aved, not by faith, but by the want of it:</Q> But a man's <HI>own</HI> care is profitable; for, <Q>If you would have a faithful &s;ervant, and one that you like, &s;erve your&s;elf. A little neglect may breed great mi&s;chief; for want of a nail the &s;hoe was lo&s;t; for want of a &s;hoe the hor&s;e was lo&s;t; and for want of a hor&s;e the rider was lo&s;t,</Q> being overtaken and &s;lain by the enemy; all for want of a little care about a hor&s;e-&s;hoe nail.</Q></P>
<P N="3">III. <Q>So much for indu&s;try, my friends, and attention to one's own bu&s;ine&s;s; but to the&s;e we mu&s;t add frugality, if we would make our indu&s;try more certainly &s;ucce&s;sful. A man may, if he knows not how to &s;ave as he gets, <Q>keep his no&s;e all his life to the grind&s;tone, and die not worth a groat at la&s;t. A fat kitchen makes a lean will;</Q> and
<Q><L>"Many e&s;tates are &s;pent in the getting,</L>
<L>"Since women for tea for&s;ook &s;pinning and knitting,</L>
<L>"And men for punch for&s;ook hewing and &s;plitting."</L></Q>
<Q>If you would be wealthy, think of &s;aving, as well as of getting. The Indies have not made Spain rich, becau&s;e her outgoes are greater than her incomes.</Q></Q></P>
<P><Q>Away, then, with your expen&s;ive follies, and you will not then have &s;o much cau&s;e to complain of hard times, heavy taxes, and chargeable families; for
<Q><L>"Women and wine, game and deceit,</L>
<L>"Make the wealth &s;mall, and the want great."</L></Q>
And farther, <Q>What maintains one vice, would bring up two children.</Q> You may think, perhaps, that a little tea, or a little punch now and then, diet a little more co&s;tly, cloaths a little finer, and a little entertainment now and then, can be no great matter; but remember, "Many a little makes a mickle." Beware of little expences; <Q>A &s;mall leak will &s;ink a great &s;hip,</Q> as Poor Richard &s;ays; and again, <Q>Who dainties love, &s;hall beg|gars prove;</Q> and moreover, <Q>Fools make fea&s;ts, and wi&s;e men eat them.</Q> Here you are all got together to this &s;ale of fineries and nick-nacks. You call them <HI>goods;</HI> but, if you do not take care, they will prove <HI>evils</HI> to &s;ome of you. You expect they will be &s;old cheap, and, perhaps, they may for le&s;s than they co&s;t; but, if you have no occa&s;ion for them, they mu&s;t be dear to you. Remember what Poor Richard &s;ays, <Q>Buy what thou ha&s;t no need of, and ere long thou &s;halt &s;ell thy nece&s;&s;aries.</Q> And again, <Q>At a great pennyworth pau&s;e awhile.</Q> He means, that perhaps the cheapne&s;s is apparent only, and not real; or the bargain, by &s;traitening thee in thy bu&s;ine&s;s, may do thee more harm than good. For in another place he &s;ays, <Q>Many have been ruined by buying good penny|worths.</Q> Again, <Q>It is fooli&s;h to lay out money in a purcha&s;e of repentance;</Q> and yet this folly is practi&s;ed every day at auctions, for want of minding the Almanack. Many a one, for the &s;ake of finery on the back, has gone with a hungry belly, and half &s;tarved their families; <Q>Silks and &s;attins, &s;carlets and velvets, put out the kitchen fire,</Q> as Poor Richard &s;ays. The&s;e are not the nece&s;&s;aries of life; they can &s;carcely be called the con|veniencies; and yet only becau&s;e they look pretty, how many want to have them? By the&s;e, and other extravagances, the genteel are reduced to poverty, and forced to borrow of tho&s;e whom they formerly de&s;pi&s;ed, but who, through indu&s;try and frugality, have maintained their &s;tanding; in which ca&s;e it appears plainly that <Q>A ploughman on his legs, is higher than a gentleman on his knees,</Q> as Poor Richard &s;ays.&mdash; Perhaps they have had a &s;mall e&s;tate left them, which they knew not the getting of; they think. "It is day, and will never be night;" that a little to be &s;pent out of &s;o much is not worth minding; but <Q>Always taking out of the meal-tub, and never putting in, &s;oon comes to the bottom,</Q> as Poor Richard &s;ays; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> have known before, if they had often his advice: <Q>If you would know the value of money, go and try to borrow &s;ome; for he that goes a borrowing goes a &s;orrowing,</Q> as Poor Richard &s;ays; and, indeed, &s;o does he that lends to &s;uch people, when he goes to get it in again. Poor Dick farther advi&s;es, and &s;ays,
<Q><L>"Fond pride of dre&s;s is &s;ure a very cur&s;e;</L>
<L>"Ere fancy you con&s;ult, con&s;ult your pur&s;e."</L></Q>
And again, <Q>Pride is as loud a beggar as Want, and a great deal more &s;aucy.</Q> When you have bought one fine thing, you mu&s;t buy ten more, that your appearance may be all of a-piece; but Poor Dick &s;ays, <Q>It is ea&s;ier to &s;uppre&s;s the fir&s;t de&s;ire, than to &s;atisfy all that follow it:</Q> And it is as truly folly for the poor to ape the rich, as for the frog to &s;well, in order to equal the ox.
<Q><L>"Ve&s;&s;els large may venture more,</L>
<L>"But little boats &s;hould keep near &s;hore."</L></Q>
"It is, however, a folly &s;oon puni&s;hed:" for, as Poor Richard &s;ays, <Q>Pride that dines on vanity &s;ups on contempt: Pride breakfa&s;ted with plenty, dined with poverty, and &s;upped with infamy.</Q> And, after all, of what u&s;e is this pride of appearance, for which &s;o much is ri&s;ked, &s;o much is &s;uffered? It cannot promote health, nor ea&s;e pain; it makes no increa&s;e of merit in the per&s;on, it creates en|vy, it ha&s;tens misfortune.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But what madne&s;s mu&s;t it be to <HI>run in debt</HI> for the&s;e &s;uper&s;luities? We are offered, by the terms of this &s;ale, &s;ix months credit; and that, perhaps, has induced &s;ome of us to attend it, becau&s;e we cannot &s;pare the ready money, and hope now to be fine without it. But ah! think what you do when you run in debt; you give to another power over your liberty. If you cannot pay at the time, you will be a&s;hamed to &s;ee your creditor; you will be in fear when you &s;peak to him; you will make poor, pitiful, &s;neaking excu&s;es, and, by de|grees, come to lo&s;e your veracity, and &s;ink into ba&s;e downright lying; for <Q>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> vice is lying, the fir&s;t is running in debt,</Q> as Poor Richard &s;ays; and again to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, "Lying rides upon Debt's back:" whereas a free born American ought not to be a&s;hamed nor afraid to &s;ee or &s;peak to any man living. But poverty often deprives a man of all &s;pirit and virtue.</Q> <Q>It is hard for an empty bag to &s;tand upright.</Q> <Q>What would you think of that prince, or of that government, who &s;hould i&s;&s;ue an edict for|bidding you to dre&s;s like a gentleman or gentlewoman, on pain of impri&s;onment or &s;ervitude? Would you not &s;ay that you were free, have a right to dre&s;s as you plea&s;e, and that &s;uch an edict would be a breach of your privileges, and &s;uch a government tyrannical? And yet you are about to put your&s;elf under that tyranny when you run in debt for &s;uch dre&s;s! Your creditor has authority, at his plea&s;ure, to de|prive you of your liberty, by confining you in gaol for life, or by &s;elling you for a &s;ervant, if you &s;hould not be able to pay him. When you have got your bargain, you may, per|haps, think little of payment; but as Poor Richard &s;ays, <Q>Creditors have better me|mories than debtors; creditors are a &s;uper&s;ti|tious &s;ect, great ob&s;ervers of &s;et days and times.</Q> The day comes round before you are aware, and the demand is made before you are prepared to &s;atisfy it; or, if you bear your debt in mind, the term which at fir&s;t &s;eemed &s;o long, will, at it le&s;&s;ens, appear ex|tremely &s;hort. Time will &s;eem to have added wings to his heels as well as his &s;houlders. <Q>Tho&s;e have a &s;hort Lent who owe money to be paid at Ea&s;ter.</Q> At pre&s;ent, perhaps, you may think your&s;elves in thriving circum|&s;tances, and that you can bear a little extra|vagance without injury: but
<Q><L>"For age and want &s;ave while you may,</L>
<L>"No morning &s;un la&s;ts a whole day."</L></Q>
Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but ever, while you live, expence is con&s;tant and certain; and, <Q>It is ea&s;ier to build two chimneys, than to keep one in fuel,</Q> as Poor Richard &s;ays: So, <Q>Rather go to bed &s;up|perle&s;s than ri&s;e in debt.</Q></Q></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P><Q><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> you have got the philo&s;opher's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> you will no longer complain of bad times, or the difficulty of paying taxes.</Q></P>
<P N="4">IV. <Q>This doctrine, my friends; is rea&s;on and wi&s;dom: But, after all, do not depend too much upon your own indu&s;try and fruga|lity and prudence, though excellent things; for they may all be bla&s;ted without the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven; and, therefore, a&s;k that ble&s;&s;ing humbly, and be not uncharitable to tho&s;e that at pre&s;ent &s;eem to want it, but comfort and help them. Remember Job &s;uffered, and was afterwards pro&s;perous.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And now, to conculde, <Q>Experience keeps a dear &s;chool, but fools will learn in no other,</Q> as Poor Richard &s;ays, and &s;carce in that; for, it is true, <Q>We may give ad|vice, but we cannot give conduct:</Q> How|ever, remember this, <Q>They that will not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, cannot be helped;</Q> and fur|ther, that <Q>If you will not hear Rea&s;on, &s;he will &s;urely rap your knuckles,</Q> as Poor Richard &s;ays.</Q></P>
<P>Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. The people heard it, and approved the doctrine, and immediately practi&s;ed the contrary, ju&s;t as if it had been a common &s;ermon; for the auction opened, and they began to buy extravagantly&mdash;I found the good man had thoroughly &s;tudied my Almanacks, and dige&s;ted all I had dropt on the&s;e topics during the cour&s;e of twenty-five years. The frequent mention he made of me mu&s;t have tired any one el&s;e; but my vanity was wonderfully delighted with it, though I was con&s;cious, that not a tenth part of the wi&s;dom was my own, which he a&s;cribed to me; but rather the gleanings that I had made of the &s;en&s;e of all ages and nations. However, I re|&s;olved to be the better for the echo of it; and, though I had at fir&s;t determined to buy &s;tuff for a new coat, I went away, re&s;olved to wear my old one a little longer. Reader, if thou wilt do the &s;ame, thy profit will be as great as mine. I am, as ever,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Thine to &s;erve thee, RICHARD SAUNDERS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
