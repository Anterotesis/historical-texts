<HEAD>TO THE KING's Mo&s;t Excellent MAJESTY in COUNCIL, The REPRESENTATION and PETITION of Your Maje&s;ty's dutiful and loyal Subjects, FREEHOLDERS and INHABITANTS of the Province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER>Mo&s;t humbly &s;heweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT having received certain information that the A&s;&s;embly of this Province, during their la&s;t &s;itting, had drawn up a PETITION to your Maje&s;ty, &s;etting forth among other things, "That mi&s;chievious di&s;agreements &s;ub&s;i&s;t in this govern|ment, which proceed, as they conceive, from the very Nature of it; and that a Spirit of Violence, Riot and Confu&s;ion prevails among us, which cannot be controuled by the pre&s;ent Powers of Government and renders a Change of the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ary":&mdash;Sundry Magi&s;trates and reputable Freeholders, alarmed at the Nature of this Petition, and con|&s;idering the whole Province as deeply affected by it, did (in Behalf of them&s;elves and others) apply to the Speaker of A&s;&s;embly for Copy of the &s;ame, and to know whether the Hou&s;e intended to tran&s;mit it to England, without communicating its Contents to their Con&s;tituents, and obtaining their fulle&s;t and mo&s;t explicit Content therein.</P>
<P>THAT they were informed by the Speaker, that the Petition had already been tran&s;mit|ted to be laid before your Maje&s;ty, and no Copy of it could be given without the Leave of the Hou&s;e, at their Meeting in September next; when we apprehend it might be too late for us to &s;ubmit our Sen&s;e of this Matter to your Maje&s;ty; and therefore we beg Leave in all humble Duty, to <HI>repre&s;ent</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>THAT as there is no civil Happine&s;s on Earth which we &s;hould e&s;teem equal to that of being under your Maje&s;ty's immediate per&s;onal Government, if our remote Situation could permit &s;uch a Ble&s;&s;ing; yet as we and all your American Subjects mu&s;t be governed by Per&s;ons authorized and approved by your Maje&s;ty, on the be&s;t Recommendation that can be obtained of them, we cannot perceive our Condition in this Re&s;pect to be different from our Fellow Subjects around us, or that we are thereby le&s;s under your Maje&s;ty's par|ticular Care and Protection than they are; &s;ince there can be no Governor of this Province, without your Maje&s;ty's immediate Approbation and Authority.</P>
<P>THAT the particular Mode or Frame of Government which we enjoy under your Ma|je&s;ty in this Province (as derived to us by the Charter of your Royal Ance&s;tor KING CHARLES the Second, and delivered to us by our wi&s;e Founder WILLIAM PENN <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>) is held in the highe&s;t E&s;timation by good Men of all Denominations among us, and hath brought Multitudes of indu&s;trious People from various Parts of the World, who tru&s;ting in the perpetual Enjoyment of the ine&s;timable Privileges it gives them, have, at their own Expence, &s;ettled this Colony, and rai&s;ed it, in a few Years, to be one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing in your Maje&s;ty's American Dominions chearfully embracing every Opportunity of manife&s;ting their Loyalty and Affection to your Maje&s;ty's Royal Per&s;on and Family.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="009786_0002_0F7A553CF97CA8D8" MS="y">THAT &s;uch Di&s;agreements as have ari&s;en in this Province we have beheld with Sorrow, but as others around us are not exempted from the like Misfortunes, We can by no Means conceive them incident to the Nature of our Government, which hath often been admini&s;tred with remarkable Harmony; and your Maje&s;ty, before whom our late Di&s;|putes have been laid, can be at no Lo&s;s, in your great Wi&s;dom, to di&s;cover whether they proceed from the above Cau&s;e, or &s;hould be a&s;cribed to &s;ome other.</P>
<P>THAT this Province (except from the Indian Ravages) enjoys the mo&s;t perfect inter|nal Tranquility; and a Spirit of Riot and Violence is &s;o foreign to the general Temper of its Inhabitants, that there are as few in&s;tances of any Di&s;turbance of this kind to be met with among them &s;ince the fir&s;t Settlement of the Colony, as perhaps among the like num|ber of People in any part of the World: That where &s;uch di&s;turbances have happened, they have been &s;peedily quieted; the civil Powers have been &s;upported; and tho' there are per|haps Ca&s;es in all Governments, where it may not be po&s;&s;ible &s;peedily to di&s;cover Offen|ders, yet we know of no in&s;tance among us where Per&s;ons legally accu&s;ed or convicted, have been &s;creen'd from public Ju&s;tice; and if the executive Part of our Government &s;hould &s;eem in any ca&s;e too weak, we conceive it is the Duty of the A&s;&s;embly, and in their Power, to &s;trengthen it, without repre&s;enting us in a Light that might unde&s;ervedly &s;ubject us to your Maje&s;ty's Royal Di&s;plea&s;ure, which we &s;hould deem the greate&s;t of all Misfortunes.</P>
<P>WE therefore mo&s;t humbly PRAY&mdash;That your Maje&s;ty would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, wholly to di&s;regard the &s;aid Petition of the A&s;&s;embly, as exceeding grievous in its Nature; as by no means containing a proper Repre&s;entation of the State of this Province; and as repugnant to the general Sen&s;e of your numerous and loyal Subjects in it; there being but few of them (comparatively &s;peaking) who could by any means be prevail'd on to give the lea&s;t Countenance to this Mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>AND your Petitioners, as in duty bound, &s;hall ever pray <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
