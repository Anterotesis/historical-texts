<HEAD>AUGUST, 27, 1794.</HEAD>
<P>THIS day the Court met, when ROBERT WATT was put to the bar, in order to be ar|raigned.</P>
<P>Mr. Knapp, Clerk of Arraigns, called upon the pri&s;oner by his name, and de&s;ired him to hold up his right hand, which he did. Mr. Knapp then read the bill of indictment which the Grand Jury had found again&s;t him to the follow|ing purport:</P>
<P>It charges the &s;aid Robert Watt not having the fear of God in his heart, nor weighing the duty of his allegiance, but being moved and &s;e|duced by the inve&s;tigation of the devil, as a fal&s;e traitor again&s;t the King, his &s;upreme, lawful, and undoubted Sovereign, and wholly withdrawing the cordial love and due and true obedience, fidelity, and allegiance, which every true and faithful &s;ubject ought to bear towards him, and wickedly, maliciou&s;ly, and traitorou&s;ly devi&s;ing, contriving, and intending to break and di&s;turb

the peace and tranquility of the kingdom, and to change, &s;ubvert, and overthrow the Govern|ment happily e&s;tabli&s;hed therein, and to u&s;urp, a&s;&s;ume, and take upon him&s;elf, together with other fal&s;e traitors, the power of Government within the kingdom, and to excite, move, and rai&s;e Rebellion again&s;t the King, within this kingdom, to depo&s;e and put down the King from the Royal &s;tate, title, power, and government of the kingdom, and him to death to put and bring. With having maliciou&s;ly, wickedly, and traitor|ou&s;ly met, con&s;ulted, con&s;pired, and agreed to cau&s;e and procure meetings to be held within this kingdom, under the name of Conventions, for the purpo&s;es of u&s;urping and a&s;&s;uming the powers and government of legi&s;lation, in, for, and over the kingdom, of effecting an altera|tion in the mode of electing Members of Parlia|ment, or obliging the King again&s;t his will, to change certain laws relating to the admini&s;tration of the kingdom, of rai&s;ing an in&s;urrection, of ob|liging the King to adopt certain laws which they wi&s;hed, of con&s;ulting concerning the &s;eizing upon the Ca&s;tle of Edinburgh by force, with pikes, guns, battle-axes, &amp;c. and al&s;o upon the Exci&s;e Office and Banks, of &s;eizing upon the Lord Ju&s;|tice Clerk, Lords of Ju&s;ticiary and Se&s;&s;ion, and Lord Provo&s;t of Edinburgh, of agreeing to be aiding in the&s;e con&s;piracies, and of in&s;tigating other per&s;ons to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in carrying the &s;ame into execution; of buying and procuring to be

made, divers pikes, &s;pears, battle-axes, &amp;c. for the above purpo&s;es, of rai&s;ing and levying, and cau&s;ing to be rai&s;ed and levied, money for the purpo&s;e of arming him&s;elf and his a&s;&s;ociates with writing and publi&s;hing wicked addre&s;&s;es, advi&s;ing the &s;ubjects of the King to &s;ub&s;cribe money, em|ploying John Fairley to di&s;tribute the &s;ame, and to per&s;uade the people to give a&s;&s;urances to him of &s;upport, to inform of how many they might depend upon, to per&s;uade the people to &s;end money to David Downie, and to purcha&s;e pikes, &amp;c. for the purpo&s;e of arming them&s;elves, and with employing William Brown and Robert Or|rock to make pikes, &amp;c. and cau&s;e them to be made for the above purpo&s;es, and which when made were concealed in the hou&s;e of the &s;aid Robert Watt.</P>
<P>After the indictment was read over, Mr. Knapp a&s;ked Mr. Watt what he had to &s;ay to it, and whether he was guilty or not guilty? To which the pri&s;oner replied, <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>

<P>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk a&s;ked the Coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner if he had any motion to make?</P>
<P>Mr. Archibald Fletcher &s;aid, that he wi&s;hed Mr. Robert Cullen to be appointed &s;enior Coun|&s;el to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the defence of Mr. Downie, in place of Mr. John Clerk.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="027815_0006_0FD64CBD56E9EBC8">
This the Court agreed to.</P>
<P>Mr. Robert Hamilton, Coun&s;el for Mr. Watt, &s;aid, that as he ob&s;erved a per&s;on of the name of Kennedy in the li&s;t of witne&s;&s;es again&s;t his client, and as he under&s;tood he would be a very material witne&s;s for the pri&s;oner, he wi&s;hed to know from the Coun&s;el for the Crown whether Kennedy was to be brought forward.</P>
<P>Mr. An&s;truther, for the Crown, &s;aid, that every exertion had been u&s;ed, both in England and Scotland to get hold of Kennedy, but hither|to without effect.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton then &s;ugge&s;ted the propriety of delaying the trial till Kennedy could be found; but this Mr. An&s;truther oppo&s;ed, a&s;&s;uring the Coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner, that if they would in|form where Kennedy was, they &s;hould not be deprived of his evidence; for that if the King's Coun&s;el knew where he was, Mr. An&s;truther pro|mi&s;ed to have him brought forward.</P>
<P>Mr. Fletcher then &s;ugge&s;ted that it would be proper to have it fixed which of the pri&s;oners &s;hould be fir&s;t brought to trial.</P>
<P>The Lord Advocate &s;aid, Mr. Watt was the per&s;on fir&s;t meant to be tried.</P>
<P>The Court then adjourned till Wedne&s;day next.</P>

<HEAD>SEPTEMBER 3.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. Knapp, Clerk of Arraigns, proceeded to call the Jury, &s;everal of whom, in con&s;equence of the peremptory challenge which the Engli&s;h law
<PB N="9" REF="027815_0007_0FD64CBF033676C8">
affords, the pri&s;oner objected to; at la&s;t a jury of twelve citizens were &s;worn in and impannelled.</P>
<P>Mr. Knapp recapitulated to the Jury the heads of the indictment, particularizing the different over-acts of trea&s;on of which the pri&s;oner was accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Dundas then ro&s;e, and opened the plead|ings, by addre&s;&s;ing the Jury on the part of the pro&s;ecution. He &s;aid, that as the Clerk of Ar|raigns had read the &s;ub&s;tance of the indictment, it would be unnece&s;&s;ary for him to recapitulate it fully. He would only notice, that it &s;tated the Defendant having held a private corre&s;pondence for the purpo&s;e of procuring and e&s;tabli&s;hing a meeting called a Convention, under the pretence indeed of obtaining a Reform, but really for the purpo&s;e of u&s;urping the powers of government, though they &s;ometimes &s;aid it was to obtain a re|dre&s;s of their &s;uppo&s;ed grievances. The indict|ment al&s;o charges him with having a&s;&s;i&s;ted in pro|curing arms, which no doubt were to be employed again&s;t the government of the country; and finally the pri&s;oner has con&s;ulted on mea&s;ures to overawe the legi&s;lature, and endanger the per&s;on of the King.</P>
<P>Mr. An&s;truther &s;aid, It is my duty to lay be|fore you the &s;tate of the charge which the Coun|&s;el for the Crown now bring again&s;t the pri&s;oner at the bar&mdash;He remarked, that &s;uch had been the peace the happine&s;s, and the pro&s;perity of this country, and the Con&s;titution under which we
<PB N="10" REF="027815_0008_0FD64CC0E53BE7F8">
live, that the law of trea&s;on lives only in our re|membrance; nor have we &s;een an in&s;tance of its exerci&s;e for half a century. He &s;aid, he would &s;hortly &s;tate what the law is, and what are the crimes which con&s;titute a breach of it.</P>
<P>I profe&s;s not, &s;aid he, to po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e powers of oratory, for which &s;ome are &s;o famed, but, if I did, I &s;hould ab&s;tain from exerci&s;ing them on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; for, I know I &s;hould ill per|form that duty I owe to my &s;overeign, whom I &s;erve, if I attempted to inflame your pa&s;&s;ions, or mi&s;lead your judgement, again&s;t the per&s;on now at the bar. I &s;hall, therefore, give you a plain &s;im|ple &s;tatement.</P>
<P>Mr. An&s;truther then &s;tated, that at the time of the Union of England and Scotland, it was judged proper that the law of trea&s;on &s;hould be the &s;ame in both countries; for as it was then brought about that we &s;hould have one Sovereign, to whom we owed the &s;ame allegiance and duties, it was therefore determined, that in this re&s;pect we &s;hould have the &s;ame law; and gentlemen, give me leave to remind you, it was a beneficent act that extended the Engli&s;h law of trea&s;on to this country, for that exi&s;ting here before that period was infinitely more &s;evere. The law of trea&s;on lies in little compa&s;s, and it has exi&s;ted in England &s;ince Edward III. and was reduced to a certainty, which has little varied &s;ince that period.</P>
<P>It &s;tates three &s;pecies of trea&s;on; compa&s;&s;ing
<PB N="11" REF="027815_0009_0FD64CC3F3F4D7A0">
and imagining the death of the King; levying war again&s;t him; and adhering to his enemies; and whoever is guilty of the&s;e, is guilty of trea&s;on.</P>
<P>The offence charged is compa&s;&s;ing and ima|gining the death of the King. The act charges not the offence done, but the intention of the per|&s;on, viz. that of compa&s;&s;ing the death of the King. The law has been careful, becau&s;e the law knows the danger of allowing &s;uch intention to be car|ried into effect; but while the law is thus &s;cru|pulous in pre&s;erving the life of the King, it is equally careful in pre&s;erving the life of the &s;ub|ject; and though it &s;ays compa&s;&s;ing and ima|gining, yet it is not upon loo&s;e grounds, for the act of Edward &s;pecifies the manner to be by open deed.</P>
<P>An overt-act is the mean u&s;ed to effectuate the purpo&s;e of mind; but though you have thus heard of con<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ing and imagining the death of the King, you are not to &s;uppo&s;e I mu&s;t &s;tate a direct act of attempting to poi&s;on or de&s;troy the King. I mu&s;t prove to you the means which the per&s;on has u&s;ed to obtain his end; but, as I wi&s;h you to take no con&s;truction of mine, therefore I will lay before you the opinion of the mo&s;t cele|brated Judges upon the law of trea&s;on. Here Mr. An&s;truther &s;tated a variety of law authorities. One author, he ob&s;erved, &s;ays the law is not con|fined to direct attacks on his life, but to the means whereby the life of the Sovereign may be endan|gered: that therefore, entering into mea&s;ures to
<PB N="12" REF="027815_0010_0FD64CC3F7A24770">
get his per&s;on into cu&s;tody are overt-acts, becau&s;e they are means whereby his life may be endan|gered. If I can bring any thing, by which the King's per&s;on and life were endangered, I call that high trea&s;on. Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Hale &s;ays, if the con&s;piracy be what mu&s;t induce it, that is compa&s;&s;ing the death of the King. So, if a con&s;piracy is proved again&s;t the pri&s;oner, which would have endangered the life of the King, that is what this Judge defines high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>If I make out a charge again&s;t the pri&s;oner, that he intended levying war again&s;t the King, to force him to do a particular thing, that is compa&s;&s;ing the death of the King; for, as a learned Judge &s;ays, he that fights again&s;t the King, mu&s;t know that it puts his per&s;on in danger; or, if I &s;how a de&s;ign, which cannot be carried without evident danger to the King, it will be your duty to find the crime of trea&s;on. If a con&s;piracy be formed to levy war again&s;t the three e&s;tates of the kingdom, how can that be carried on without endangering the life of his Maje&s;ty?&mdash;It is an overt-act of trea&s;on wherever the de&s;ign cannot be carried into effect without apparent danger to the King. Ju&s;tice Hale &s;ays, a con&s;piracy to levy war again&s;t the King, however di&s;gui&s;ed under pretence of rectifying abu&s;es, ca&s;ting down inclo&s;ures, &amp;c. mu&s;t be compa&s;&s;ing the death of the King, for, it is &s;aid, he that endeavours to conquer the King, cannot intend le&s;s than taking away his life.</P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, I have no &s;cruple to &s;ay,
<PB N="13" REF="027815_0011_0FD64CC400966FB8">
that the King's Council will prove that the pri|&s;oner had entered into a con&s;piracy to conquer the King, by levying war to force him to redre&s;s &s;uppo&s;ed grievances; and meetings to con&s;ult about overawing the King, and levying war, is an overt-act of high trea&s;on. I will lay before you the means u&s;ed by the pri&s;oner to accom|pli&s;h his end; and if I prove it a con&s;piracy again&s;t the King, it is high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>In a ca&s;e brought before Ju&s;tice Coke, it was &s;aid there was no war levied, and therefore the con&s;piracy to levy war was not high trea&s;on. If there be a de&s;ign to re&s;train his Maje&s;ty by a con&s;ultation to levy war, then it is high trea&s;on. In the reign of George I. in the ca&s;e of Lair, it was agreed, that a con&s;piracy to levy war was not high trea&s;on; but the judge &s;aid, the law is, that a con&s;ultation to levy war again&s;t the King in an overt-act of high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>A con&s;piracy to levy war has many times been indicted as an overt-act of high trea&s;on. Here Mr. An&s;truther &s;tated a ca&s;e of con&s;piracy, and of the publi&s;hing a paper propo&s;ing to &s;eize the Tower of London and his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters, which was con&s;idered as high trea&s;on, although compa&s;&s;ing the death of the King was not men|tioned in the indictment.</P>
<P>The fact I mean now to try, after having thus &s;tated the law, is &s;uch a con&s;piracy or de&s;ign upon the part of the pri&s;oner, as might have put the King's life in danger. This is not a &s;mall con|&s;piracy
<PB N="14" REF="027815_0012_0FD64CC7E23A40B8">
of a few individuals in an ob&s;cure corner, but it is a con&s;piracy ari&s;en from &s;mall begin|nings, under the appearance of &s;eeking legal mea&s;ures, urged on by per&s;ons circulating &s;edi|tious papers, and by &s;editious &s;ocieties here and el&s;ewhere, and agreeing to a de&s;ign to be carried into execution, which would have deluged this country with blood. Such is the con&s;piracy charged again&s;t the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>You know, Gentlemen, there have been va|rious &s;ocieties who a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves the names of "Friends of the People." Their fir&s;t pretended object was Reform by Petition; but whether they wi&s;hed to obtain their cau&s;e or be denied I know not; but their petition, however, did not meet &s;ucce&s;s. Soon after, a new &s;cheme took place, and the fir&s;t beginning of their plan will be found in a letter &s;ent to this country by Hardy, &s;ecretary to a London &s;ociety, where he &s;ays, "our petition has been rejected; our minds therefore mu&s;t be turned to &s;ome other plan and more effectual means." To this Skirving return|ed an an&s;wer, and pointed out his plan, in which he foretells the downfall of Government. Then they turned their eyes towards a Convention; and no wonder they did &s;o, as they had &s;een the effects of a Convention in another country. A variety of letters point out di&s;tinctly that this Convention was not to petition Parliament, but to act by their own authority. Now if I can prove that the de&s;ign was to &s;uper&s;ede and annual the Go|vernment
<PB N="15" REF="027815_0013_0FD64CC99FC8A860">
of this country, and controul all its powers, I will certainly make out a ca&s;e of high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>Soon after this a body met at Edinburgh, who were afterwards joined by delegates from England, and took the title of Briti&s;h Convention. If you think their views were pure and con&s;titu|tional, there is no harm; but if otherwi&s;e, that their intentions were illegal, and to carry their plans by force, then it is neither more nor le&s;s than a plan to &s;uper&s;ede the Government and Legi&s;lature of this country, and &s;et a&s;ide the King. One part of the in&s;tructions by the Corre&s;pond|ing Society in London to Margarot were to re&s;i&s;t the Legi&s;lature of the country in ca&s;e they &s;hould do a particular act, viz. to &s;top certain meetings of the people. This then is clearly a con&s;piracy to re&s;i&s;t King, Lords, and Commons.</P>
<P>This &s;ociety was divided into &s;ections and di|vi&s;ions, and took the cant names which are u&s;ed in the Convention of France. It may be &s;aid, what harm in u&s;ing French phra&s;es? This may ab&s;tractedly be true, but you, Gentlemen, are to judge of the plans and views of men by all that you &s;ee them do. Various motions were made and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in this Convention; &s;ome for peti|tioning for Reform, &amp;c. but from the moment they a&s;&s;umed the name of the Briti&s;h Conven|tion, all idea of petitioning Parliament was laid a&s;ide; and when it was even mentioned they pa&s;&s;ed to the order of the day, which was &s;etting
<PB N="16" REF="027815_0014_0FD64CCA9F72EF10">
a&s;ide the que&s;tion altogether, and therefore I cannot but infer that &s;ome other mode was in|tended. And indeed they &s;oon after agreed to certain re&s;olutions, too bold even for this &s;ociety to publi&s;h. Among others they re&s;olved to pay no attention to any Act of Parliament which they thought &s;hould militate again&s;t the people, and continue to meet and re&s;i&s;t till compelled by &s;uperior force to de&s;i&s;t. Every delegate was in|&s;tructed on his return home, to explain to his con&s;tituents the nece&s;&s;ity of electing a delegate, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a fund for another Convention in ca&s;es of emergency. Now I will &s;hew you the pri&s;oner agreeing to this re&s;olution, and endea|vouring to carry it into effect. This Convention was indeed di&s;per&s;ed by the Chief Magi&s;trate of this city, a gentleman who&s;e honourable, upright, and &s;teady conduct, has ju&s;tly obtained for him the approbation of all good men; but &s;oon after a propo&s;al was again made for calling another Con|vention in England. The fir&s;t meeting for call|ing this Convention was held at the Globe Ta|vern, London, where it was re&s;olved, to call a Convention to rule for them&s;elves, and to have no connection with Parliament; for &s;ay they, they mu&s;t have a convention to obtain a redre&s;s from the&s;e plunderers and oppre&s;&s;ors. And who were tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ors but the e&s;tates of the kingdom&mdash;King, Lords, and Commons, whom they thus meant to &s;uper&s;ede in all their functions?</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="027815_0015_0FD64CCED463DD28">Their next meeting was held at the Chalk Farm, where they came to &s;undry re&s;olutions: among others they declare, that certain acts of Parliament they will not obey, nor &s;ubmit to.&mdash;The&s;e re&s;olutions clearly demon&s;trate, that they meant to &s;uper&s;ede the Senators of the nation, whom they call the packed Repre&s;entatives of the People in Parliament, and take the govern|ment upon them&s;elves. If you &s;hall be of opini|on that they meant to do &s;o, you cannot doubt but their object was to de&s;troy compleatly the Con&s;titution of this Country. I may be told what is all this to the pri&s;oner; but it is nece&s;|&s;ary I &s;hould &s;hew you, fir&s;t, that there was &s;uch a plan, and then &s;hew, that the pri&s;oner, was concerned; and his concern in this affair a&s;to|ni&s;hes me the more, becau&s;e about two years ago, the pri&s;oner pretended to be a zealous friend to Government, and had &s;ome communication with an illu&s;trious character, who filled the office of Secretary of State.&mdash;To that re&s;pectable cha|racter he wrote, &s;aying, he would be happy to give information re&s;pecting the Societies of the Friends of the People, and any other communi|cations that might be &s;erviceable to Government. To this letter, an an&s;wer was returned, &s;tating that &s;uch information as &s;hould be u&s;eful to Go|vernment, would be thankfully received. After this, he had &s;ome corre&s;pondence with my learn|ed friend, the Lord Advocate, who being &s;ubpoen|ed by the pri&s;oner, will, when called upon, give
<PB N="18" REF="027815_0016_0FD64CD3A331A4C0">
a proper account of what tran&s;actions took place. The corre&s;pondence, I believe, continued down to the middle of la&s;t year. Some applications were made by the pri&s;oner to my learned friend; what were the nature of the&s;e applications I will leave with his lord&s;hip to &s;ay when he is called on.&mdash;Prior to the cea&s;ing of this corre&s;pondence, however, the pri&s;oner had refu&s;ed to become a member of one of the&s;e &s;ocieties, and certainly was not a member of the Briti&s;h Convention; and unle&s;s I prove that he acceded to another Convention, and couple him with a con&s;piracy in this country, he mu&s;t be acquitted of that part of the charge.</P>
<P>But, gentlemen, you know it is not nece&s;&s;ary that I prove every act charged, if I prove one act it is &s;ufficient. If I prove he took certain means to effect the purpo&s;e of his mind, I then prove the conclu&s;ion of trea&s;on again&s;t him.&mdash;After the di&s;per&s;ion of the Briti&s;h Convention, &s;everal members formed them&s;elves into Com|mittee for the purpo&s;e of carrying on the very views of that meeting. Of this committee, the pri&s;oner was a member, and one of its purpo&s;es was to &s;elect delegates to another convention in England.</P>
<P>This convention had al&s;o for its object to meet till oppo&s;ed by force, and to collect a fund for &s;upplying delegates. The pri&s;oner moved for a committee of Union to collect the &s;en&s;e of the People, and convene another Briti&s;h Convention,
<PB N="19" REF="027815_0017_0FD62583926BBA90">
He may indeed &s;tate, that he had a peaceable meeting in view; but I &s;hall &s;hew my evidence that &s;uch could not be his object; becau&s;e he acceded to the re&s;olution of oppo&s;ing force, and to meet till di&s;per&s;ed by force, and to call ano|ther convention, &s;uch as I have de&s;cribed a treacherous meeting, to overturn the Govern|ment. This convention &s;eems to have taken great care of its members; its &s;econd re&s;olution &s;ays, the <HI>"will</HI> of the con&s;tituent is the con&s;ti|tuent, therefore, if the repre&s;entative is attacked, it is the duty of the con&s;tituent to defend him by nature, rea&s;on, and honour."</P>
<P>There was another Committee formed, of which Watt was al&s;o a member, called the Com|mittee of <HI>Ways and Means.</HI> This was a &s;ecret committee; they kept no book, and committed nothing to writing. It was to tran&s;act all the money matters of the Friends of the People, and collect funds for what they called the <HI>Great Cau&s;e.</HI> This Society was al&s;o to corre&s;pond with the Societies, who are to inform their committee what number of patriots they could depend up|on, and &s;uch as would &s;pare no pains in pro|moting the Great Cau&s;e. This committee con|&s;i&s;ted of five per&s;ons only, to whom all the &s;o|cieties were to intru&s;t their money, and every concern. Upon one occa&s;ion, this committee met to an&s;wer Hardy's letter, when Watt was pre&s;ent; and this I couple him both with the fir&s;t Briti&s;h Convention and the one to be called.</P>
<P>The next act of this committee was an at|tempt
<PB N="20" REF="027815_0018_0FD64CD6A4A43408">
to &s;educe the Fencibles in this kingdom, and excite commotion among the &s;oldiers. To effectuate this, they circulated among the &s;oldiers lying at Dalkeith, a printed bill of a mo&s;t wicked tendency. The types of this bill were found in Watt's hou&s;e, and I will trace copies of it from his hands to the per&s;on who actually di&s;tributed them.</P>
<P>Both here comes another plan which Watt pro|po&s;ed and lead in the committee. In the night time a fire was to be lighted at the Exci&s;e Office, to attack the &s;oldiers from the ca&s;tle, and when they were to march down the &s;treet to aid in ex|tingui&s;hing it, then were the Friends of the People to attack and ma&s;&s;acre them with tho&s;e deadly in&s;truments. This done, the ca&s;tle was to be taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, together with the Banks and all Public Offices&mdash;The Judges and Magi&s;trates were then to be &s;eized and impri&s;on|ed; and when all this was accompli&s;hed, a pro|clamation was to be i&s;&s;ued, ordering all farmers to bring their grain immediately to market, and ordering that no country gentleman &s;hould go three miles from home, all under the penalty of death. This was to be followed by an Addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, <HI>ordering</HI> him to di&s;mi&s;s his Mi|ni&s;ters, and di&s;&s;olve the Parliament.</P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, all this I will clearly prove; and if I do, &s;urely there can remain no doubt that the plan of this pri&s;oner was to overthrow the Government, and put the King's life in dan|ger.

I need &s;carcely add, that before this, the Friends of the People were to be all armed.&mdash;The&s;e facts he had found it incumbent on him to &s;tate; but at the &s;ame time, he reque&s;ted the Jurymen not to allow his ob&s;ervation to &s;way their judgment, but throw them out of their re|collection till they were &s;ub&s;tantiated by the evi|dence now to be adduced.</P>

<P>Edward Lauzon, King's Me&s;&s;enger, depo&s;ed, that he knew Mr. Hardy, Secretary to the Lon|don Corre&s;ponding Society, and &s;eized &s;ome papers in his hou&s;e in London.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton &s;tated, that he under&s;tood it to be law, that no proof can be adduced to any extraneous matter not in the indictment till &s;uch time as an overt-act can be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Mr. Au&s;truther an&s;wered, that before he could prove Mr. Watt to be acce&s;&s;ary to a con&s;piracy, he mu&s;t prove that &s;uch a con&s;piracy did exi&s;t, and then he would &s;hew that Watt was con|cerned.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton &s;aid, a plot in England is not the &s;ame charge with a plot in Scotland, which Mr. Watt is charged to have been concerned with,</P>

<P>He next mentioned his having been pre&s;ent when the Convention was di&s;per&s;ed at the Cro&s;s-cau&s;eway, in December la&s;t. He &s;pecified a letter of Skirving's hand-writing, dated in May, 1793, addre&s;&s;ed to Thomas Hardy, London. It acknowledged a former letter which he &s;ays would be laid before the &s;ociety.

<P>John Taylor, Fleet-&s;treet, London, &s;aid he was a member of the London Corre&s;ponding Society, and knows T.

He thinks it was about the time when Earl Stanhope delivered his &s;peech about introducing foreign troops.

There was a committee, which began to meet in his hou&s;e about the above period; Downie, Mac Ewen, Orrock, and Watt, were of that Committee which, he thinks, was called the Committee of Union.

<P>I thought no harm of it my&s;elf, but other people might think &s;o, becau&s;e I was di&s;tributing them; and the collectors might have thought I wi&s;hed to urge them upon them before they were a&s;ked. One day I propo&s;ed going to Bo-ne&s;s, when Bon|thorn a&s;ked me to carry a letter. Next morning I called on Mr. Watt, and he de&s;ired me to call at Mr. Campbell's, hatter, and get a parcel, which I did. It contained papers. Mr. Watt &s;aid, I would know what to do with it. I went to dif|ferent places, viz.

I then went to Stirling, and delivered a copy of the&s;e papers to all the people I called on, viz. Dr. Forre&s;t, in his own hou&s;e, where were &s;everal others.

&s;aid we &s;hould not get them, to which Watt an&s;wer|ed&mdash;there was no law in Britan cold prevent us.</P>

Some days after, about the 1&s;t of May, Watt called at the Dean, and de|&s;ired him to make a few pikes with cro&s;s axes, and two or three dozen of different forms. He a&s;ked me how many I could make a week? I &s;aid fifty. He a&s;ked if I could get &s;ticks? I &s;aid I might.

This letter, his Lord&s;hip &s;aid, he &s;hewed to Mr. Dundas and Mr. Pitt, who agreed with him, that &s;uch a de|mand could not be complied with, and accord|ingly an an&s;wer to that purpo&s;e was &s;ent to Mr. Watt; but that afterwards Watt informed his Lord&s;hip, that before the per&s;ons alluded to had &s;poken to him, they took him bound in a bill for 30<ABBR>l.</ABBR> which he paid; this bill his Lord&s;hip order|ed to be paid. He does not think he received any letter from Watt &s;ince July 1793, nor has &s;een him &s;ince October la&s;t.</P>
<P>(Here the whole Proof clo&s;ed.)</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton then addre&s;&s;ed the Jury on the part of the pri&s;oner. He &s;tated the importance of the trial as requiring their mo&s;t &s;erious atten|tion. It was a charge, he &s;aid, of the mo&s;t heinous nature, accu&s;ing of the highe&s;t crime: It was a ca&s;e of blood, in which they were to deter|mine on the fate of this pannel. He ob&s;erved, that by order of Court, the conducting of the
<PB N="47" REF="027815_0045_0FD64D162C267D80">
pannel's defence had been entru&s;ted to him, and he now promi&s;ed, a man of honour, to do him all the &s;ervice in his power. This he con&s;idered as a duty he owed to him, and a duty he owed to his own feelings. The crime, he &s;aid, was not a di|rect attak on the &s;acred per&s;on of his Maje&s;ty. If it had, I &s;hould not have brought my voice to life in defence of the criminal.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton now entered upon an inve&s;tiga|tion of the law of trea&s;on, and, in a very ma&s;terly manner, went through a voluminous body of law authorities, to &s;how its nature and di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>He then went over the whole evidence, and combated it in its various parts in the mo&s;t able manner. He took notice of the &s;uppo&s;ed attack on the Ca&s;tle as an irrational and extravagantly fooli&s;h idea. Of the pikes found, he remarked, that the &s;mallne&s;s of the number was &s;ufficient to prove, they could not be intended to be u&s;ed in any &s;erious attack again&s;t this country; be&s;ides only &s;even per&s;ons were belonging to this com|mittee who are &s;aid to have known of them. Could &s;even per&s;ons u&s;e forty-&s;even pikes? Could forty-&s;even pikes take the Ca&s;tle, ma&s;&s;acre the &s;oldiers, &s;eize the Judges, and overcome the go|vernment? Upon every topic of the evidence, he di&s;canted with great ability, and particularly al|luded to the panel's corre&s;pondence with tho&s;e in power, &s;aying, that was in order to follow out his plan of obtaining information, that he had done what was charged again&s;t him. His ca&s;e was
<PB N="48" REF="027815_0046_0FD64D192D0928D8">
&s;imilar to that of a &s;py in an enemy's camp or army, where it was not only nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould wear their uniform, but al&s;o carry arms again&s;t the power he meant to &s;erve. Yet, could it be &s;aid, that if &s;uch a per&s;on is taken by that power who employed him as a &s;py, that he &s;hould &s;uffer for being taken under &s;uch circum&s;tances? He argued that it was probable the pri&s;oner meant to have given intimation to Mr. Dundas, of any of the&s;e plans that might be forming, &s;o &s;oon as he found it a proper time to do &s;o. He ob&s;erved, that it was mo&s;t unque&s;tionably nece&s;&s;ary, that govern|ment &s;hould have proper per&s;ons to give them in|timation of any improper &s;chemes going on; but, what per&s;on will be found &s;o hardy in future, if this man &s;hall fall in the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>After many mo&s;t ingenious remarks, he con|cluded by &s;aying, That, if the cup of this man's iniquity be full, the dregs are bitter, yet he mu&s;t drink them; but if otherwi&s;e, and he &s;hall yet meet with a deliverance, then it falls to you, gen|tlemen of the jury, to da&s;h the cup from his trembling lip, that he may not ta&s;te its bitters.</P>
<P>The Lord Advocate then ro&s;e to reply; and &s;aid, that as the trial had branched out &s;o long, he &s;hould be as conci&s;e as the nature and impor|tance of the ca&s;e required. His Lord&s;hip ob|&s;erved, that although the learned gentleman who had preceded him &s;aid, that no allu&s;ions to the &s;tate of affairs in another country, ought to be mentioned on this occa&s;ion, yet, as the &s;imilarity
<PB N="49" REF="027815_0047_0FD64D1EEF95C340">
of the plans adopted by the di&s;contented in this country &s;o nearly re&s;embled that which was &s;o unhappily pur&s;ued there, he thought it his duty to &s;ay, that what had appeared in evidence this day, fully ju&s;tified him in &s;aying, that there was but too much truth in it. His Lord&s;hip urged at great length, and with much ability, on the laws of Trea&s;on, particularly the Statute of Edw. III. and adduced the opinion of many able Engli&s;h Lawyers in &s;upport of his con&s;truction of that Statute. He was clearly of opinion, that the crime laid in the indictment, whatever con&s;truc|tions his learned brother (Mr. Hamilton) might give it, was clearly that &s;pecies of trea&s;on, of compa&s;&s;ing and imagining the death of the King.</P>
<P>He then proceeded to &s;um up the evidence in &s;upport of the charge; which he demon&s;trated to be clearly and &s;ub&s;tantially proved; yet, if the Jury were not of his opinion he &s;hould be happy at the acquittal of the pri&s;oner&mdash;as the Jury were the Judges of that, not he; and if that was the ca&s;e, none would more rejoice at &s;uch an event than him&s;elf, though, from the complexion of the evidence, there was little hopes of that being the ca&s;e. His Lord&s;hip then &s;tated to the Jury the nature of the evidence beginning with Har|dy's corre&s;pondence with Skirving. He then proceeded to &s;tate the proceedings of the Briti&s;h Convention till its di&s;per&s;ion, which was proved by Ro&s;s, Aitchi&s;on, and others&mdash;the proceedings of the London corre&s;ponding Society at the
<PB N="50" REF="027815_0048_0FD64D20A6EC2450">
Globe Tavern and Chalk Farm, which was proved by Me&s;&s;rs, Taylor and Go&s;ling. He then &s;aid, he had proved the acce&s;&s;ion of Watt to the &s;chemes of the Friends of the People, by his be|ing a member of both the Committees of Union and Ways and Means, and that he was a princi|pal ringleader of the Committees&mdash;that he had propo&s;ed the plan for the taking of the Ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, &s;ecuring the per&s;ons of the Judges, Lord Provo&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;he taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Banks and Exci&s;e Office, and the attacking and di&s;arming the &s;oldiers. That, at an after meet|ing of the committee, he had read an addre&s;s to the people in form of a proclamation: That he had di&s;patched Fairly to the We&s;t Country, to &s;ee <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> minds of the people &s;tood affected: That he had employed Orrock and Brown to make pikes, which were afterwards found by Mr. Lockhart and Middleton in Watt's hou&s;e. That the types of a feditious hand bill were likewi&s;e found in Watt's hou&s;e, which was circulated among the fencibles at Dalkeith&mdash;and that, upon the whole, the indictment with re&s;pect to the pri&s;oner was clearly proved by the concurring te&s;timony of almo&s;t all the witne&s;s adduced for the Crown. With regard to the defence &s;et up for the pri&s;oner, that he had gone into all tho&s;e &s;chemes merely that he might inform govern|ment what was going on among the Friends of the People, he &s;aid this was highly ab&s;urd and
<PB N="51" REF="027815_0049_0FD64D2115A21218">
improbable; for although for &s;ome con&s;iderable time he and Mr. Watt had been acquainted, and Mr. Watt had communicated various pieces of in|formation to him, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> from the end of la&s;t year, he had joined the Friends of the People, and become an active <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> among them, without acquainting him or any &s;ervant of the Crown, of the alteration of his conduct. This defence, therefore, could avail him nothing, as before he joined the Friends of the People he had entirely withdrawn him&s;elf from giving information to the government. He thought, therefore, the Jury could do no le&s;s than find the pri&s;oner guilty.</P>
<P>The right honourable the Lord Pre&s;ident then charged the Jury, both with regard to the law and the fact, with the greate&s;t candour and preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Jury were then attended by two con|&s;tables to be enclo&s;ed. However, they remain|ed out of court only a few minutes, when they returned.</P>

<P>"The pri&s;oner is charged with endea|vouring to bring about, or a&s;&s;embling a
<PB N="55" REF="027815_0053_0FD64D2FFA63D488">
Convention, &s;imilar in its views with the one which &s;ome time ago met in this City, called the Briti&s;h Convention. He is al&s;o accu&s;ed of procuring, or cau&s;ing to be made, arms, or offen&s;ive weapons, in or|der to levy war again&s;t the King, with a determination to re&s;i&s;t his royal authority, and compel him to comply with certain mea&s;ures, to di&s;mi&s;s his mini&s;ters, di&s;&s;olve the parliament, and put an end to the war. Another charge is, that he endea|voured to &s;educe the &s;oldiers from their duty and allegiance; and that &s;hortly, he has taken &s;uch mea&s;ures as make him ac|cu&s;ed of compa&s;&s;ing and imagining the death of the King.&mdash;The&s;e particulars will be more fully &s;tated by the Coun&s;el who is now to addre&s;s you."</P>
<P>The Lord Advocate then ro&s;e, and &s;aid,</P>
<P><HI>"Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>"This is an indictment for High Trea|&s;on, and my duty is to &s;tate to you the law upon that &s;ubject, and the general na|ture and import of the facts which, on the part of the Crown and the public, I mean to bring evidence to &s;upport. It is your duty, Gentlemen, to con&s;ider the whole
<PB N="56" REF="027815_0054_0FD64D300313E720">
evidence, and from thence form what your judgment &s;hall be.</P>
<P>"Gentlemen, it mu&s;t be well known to you, that at the Union of the two king|doms, the &s;y&s;tem of the trea&s;on law of this country &s;uffered an alteration, founded on the be&s;t grounds of expediency; and &s;ince that period the trea&s;on law of England had been adopted in this country. Had the Scots trea&s;on law &s;till remained here, tho&s;e men who are now &s;uffering the puni&s;hment of their crimes in a di&s;tant country, would have &s;uffered a capital puni&s;hment. To the honour of the trea&s;on law of England it has remained &s;ince Edward III. the &s;ame down to this day, and has been the founda|tion of all the trials for trea&s;on that have ta|ken place &s;ince; and it has met the applau&s;e of our mo&s;t celebrated lawyers, and be&s;t hi&s;torians, and the people have lived happy under it:&mdash;for, while it guards and pro|tects the life of his Maje&s;ty, it is equally careful of the life of the &s;ubject, being a bar|rier again&s;t any over&s;tretched power.</P>
<P>"It includes three di&s;tinct ca&s;es of trea|&s;on: 1&s;t, Compa&s;&s;ing and imagining the the death of the King:&mdash;2d, Levying war again&s;t the
<PB N="57" REF="027815_0055_0FD64D31968D73E8">
King:&mdash;3d, Adhearing to his enemies.&mdash;The fir&s;t, viz. compa&s;&s;ing and imagining the death of the King, falls to be, in this ca&s;e the mo&s;t material. The &s;econd al&s;o comes under your con&s;ideration; for endeavouring to levy war, even although it is not actual|ly levied, falls under the fir&s;t head, that of compa&s;&s;ing and imagining the death of the King. Since the Union, we have had two rebellions in this country; but by the &s;pecial Statute, the per&s;ons who were brought to trial for there concern in them, were tried in the Si&s;ter Kingdom. We are the fir&s;t in this kingdom who have had the melancho|ly duty to perform&mdash;that of applying it upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Recent occurrances have &s;hown us the con&s;piracy that has been formed to &s;educe the people from their allegiance, under the &s;pecious pretence of Reform, but really with the purpo&s;e of di&s;troying the lawful authorities of the country, and the fair fa|bric of our Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>"The Act of Parliament, of which I am now to &s;peak, needs no explanation; yet for your &s;atisfaction, I will &s;tate, not in my own words, but in the words of the mo&s;t
<PB N="58" REF="027815_0056_0FD64D31D10C3648">
celebrated Engli&s;h lawyers, there opinion concerning it.&mdash;Here his Lord&s;hip went through a great number of law authorities, Judge Fo&s;ter, Hawkins, and Black&s;tone. One of the&s;e, he remarked, &s;aid, with re|gard to compa&s;&s;ing the death of the King, "that the will mu&s;t be taken for the deed."&mdash;The King is the head of the body politic, and members are connected under him; and his life cannot be taken away but it mu&s;t involve the Nation in blood. If con&s;pira|tors meet, and con&s;ult to take away the life of the King, every per&s;on who has a pre|vious knowledge, and attends &s;uch con&s;ult|ation, if he does not give information, falls to be pre&s;ented to a Jury.&mdash;The law does not confine the crime to a direct attack, but to every attempt at compa&s;&s;ing the death of the King, or &s;eizing his per&s;on; for ex|perience has &s;hown, that, between the per|&s;on and the grave of princes, the di&s;tance is very &s;mall. Every attempt even to &s;eize his per&s;on is con&s;idered compa&s;&s;ing his death: for, the purpo&s;e cannot be effect|ed, without manife&s;t danger to his per&s;on.</P>
<P>Gentleman, you all well know, that about two years ago a number of per&s;ons formed
<PB N="59" REF="027815_0057_0FD64D382235E770">
clubs and &s;ocieties, to obtain, as they &s;aid, Parliament Reform; but whatever was their pretence, their real &s;cheme was to &s;ubvert the Con&s;titution, and introduce univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual Parliaments in place of that happy &s;y&s;tem under which we &s;o &s;e|curely live. They accordingly applied to Parliament by petition, but Parliament, to its immortal honour, di&s;covered what was couched under it, and rejected their appli|cation. Being thus di&s;appointed, &s;ome of the&s;e clubs immediately &s;et about other means; for, in a letter in 1792, from Har|dy to Skirving, he &s;ays, <Q>Our petition has been rejected, therefore, we mu&s;t take &s;ome more effectual means.</Q> We have &s;een a Briti&s;h Convention in this country, a&s;&s;uming to it&s;elf very high powers indeed, and even going the length to &s;ay, they would watch the motion of Parliament, in ca&s;e they <HI>dared</HI> to pa&s;s certain acts, and de|claring their determination to re&s;i&s;t till compelled to de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperiour force; and that upon the fir&s;t intimation given to intro|duce a certain act of Parliament, then were they to call a Convention of Emergency, and erect the &s;tandard of rebellion again&s;t

the legal con&s;tituted authorities of this king|dom.</P>
<P>To the honour of the Chief Magi&s;trate of this city, who&s;e conduct upon that as upon every other occa&s;ion, has procured him the e&s;teem of every good citizen, he went and di&s;per&s;ed this Convention. Pro&s;ecutions were afterwards brought again&s;t the ring|leaders in the&s;e tran&s;actions, and they &s;uf|fered the ju&s;t puni&s;hment which their crimes merited.&mdash;I will prove &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, that the pri&s;oner was a member of this Convention.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Downie</HI>&mdash;My <HI>Lord Pre&s;ident,</HI> I ob|ject to the Lord Advocate &s;tating this to the Jury; for I was formerly a witne&s;s in one of the&s;e trials, and was told by the Court, that I never could be charged for my conduct in the&s;e matters.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lord Pre&s;ident</HI> &s;aid, the Lord Advo|cate was not to charge him with any crime committed previous to that trial, but only what was done &s;ince.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lord Advocate</HI> proceeded. "I mu&s;t &s;how his connection with that Convention to prove his views the &s;ame in the one which was propo&s;ed to be held. His Lord|&s;hip

next proceeded to &s;hew that he was a member of the different Committees of Union and Ways and Means, of acting as Trea&s;ure, and collecting and paying money to promote the Grand Cau&s;e, as it was ter|med. That the&s;e Committees had corre&s;|ponded with a &s;ociety in London, who vot|ed the mo&s;t calumnious re&s;olutions again&s;t the Judges of this country.</P>
<P>"His Lord&s;hip then &s;tated his intention to prove the pri&s;oner guilty of endeavoring to &s;educe the military from their duty and al|legiance, by the di&s;tribution of a hand-bill among the Fencibles at Dalkeith, entitled, "An Addre&s;s to the Fencibles." That he was acce&s;&s;ary to the plan read by Watt for taking the Ca&s;tle, &s;eizing the Judges, Ma|gi&s;trates, &amp;c. and to the emba&s;&s;y which was &s;ent to the we&s;t country, for &s;ounding the di&s;po&s;itions of the people: that in his capacity of Trea&s;urer to the Committee of Ways and Means, he paid the &s;miths who were employed by Watt to make the pikes that he acceded to the plan of having Col|lectors appointed, who were to collect the &s;entiments of the people, and receive mo|ney

from them, and likewi&s;e to act as Com|mander when they were armed.</P>
<P>"His Lord&s;hip with great ability expa|tiated on each of the&s;e charges, and con|cluded with ob&s;erving, that if he could prove them to the &s;atisfaction of the Jury, they doubtle&s;s would con&s;ider the charge of High Trea&s;on as fully proved.

There was a Committee of Collec|tors to collect money to pay delegates, and relieve tho&s;e who were &s;uffering for politi|cal opinions; likewi&s;e for collecting the &s;en&s;e of the people. The witne&s;s was a collector; Mr. Downie was Trea&s;urer to the whole; Fairley was a collector, and was appointed convener, and to act always as &s;uch.

<P>I did not like to do that; I was afraid of being blamed for di&s;tributing them.</P>

<P>No, I was uncertain whether they knew any thing of my in&s;tructions&mdash;as I got them through Watt, I returned them again to him.</P>

<P>When the evidence was clo&s;ed,</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cullen</HI> then ro&s;e to charge the Jury on the part of the pri&s;oner, which he did in an ingenious and argumentative &s;peech, which la&s;ted upwards of three hours. He began with laying down the law of the ca&s;e,
<PB N="80" REF="027815_0078_0FD64D686E39E878">
in which he differed very much from the Coun&s;el on the other &s;ide. He read &s;eve|ral quotations, from which he drew this general inference, that although the indict|ment charged the pri&s;oner with compa&s;&s;ing and imagining the death of the King, no &s;uch crime had been committed&mdash;for the highe&s;t part of the crime charged, even allowing it to be true, was no more than a &s;ort of <HI>Con&s;tructive Trea&s;on,</HI> which the law was very cautious in with meddling. He next proceeded to comment upon the evi|dence, the fir&s;t part of which, he &s;aid, proved nothing of the charge of trea&s;on; it only went to this, that the pri&s;oner, along with a number of other per&s;ons, &s;ome in a high and &s;ome in a low &s;ituation of life, had been active and zealous to procure a reform in the repre&s;entation of this country. If the pri&s;oner carried his notions in this bu&s;ine&s;s only as far as &s;ome other members of the Briti&s;h Convention had done, he ought to have been tried for &s;edition, which very probably might have been found a good charge again&s;t him; but there was no rea&s;on to pre&s;ume, from all this, that his being concerned in the cau&s;e of Reform,
<PB N="81" REF="027815_0079_0FD64D699E589DA0">
implicated him in the charge of high trea|&s;on, which, he was &s;ure, a candid view of the evidence would not make out.</P>
<P>Mr. Cullen next mentioned, that part of the evidence which regarded the taking of the Ca&s;tle of Edinburgh; ma&s;&s;acreing the &s;oldiers; &s;eizing the Judges, &amp;c. which &s;aid he, was one of the wilde&s;t phrenzies that ever entered into the head of man. This was not the plan of the pri&s;oner, but of Watt; he alone was the former and pro|moter of that diabolical bu&s;ine&s;s: but, he remarked, it is here attempted to be prov|ed, that the pri&s;oner and Watt were equal|ly guilty in this matter&mdash;this was by no means the ca&s;e; for, though the pri&s;oner was a member of the Briti&s;h Convention, and afterwards of the Committees of Union and Ways and Means, yet the intention of the&s;e Committees was not to promote the trea&s;onable plans and projects of Mr. Watt, but only to collect money to carry the plan of reform into effect, and for &s;uccour|ing &s;ome of their &s;uffering friends. It had been attempted to be proved, that the pri|&s;oner had both employed and paid for ma|king pikes, but the employment has not &s;o
<PB N="82" REF="027815_0080_0FD64D6B1F27EBF0">
compleatly proved as the law directs, and as to the money paid to William Brown, it was entirely on Watt's account. With regard to the evidence of Fairley, to whom likewi&s;e the pri&s;oner paid money; he cer|tainly did &s;o, on account of the Committee of Ways and Means; not to promote the plans of Watt, but merely to &s;ee how the the People in the country &s;tood affected with regard to pur&s;uing the plan of Reform: if he went farther, it was in con&s;equence of a private under&s;tanding between him and Watt, which the pri&s;oner knew nothing of. The re&s;t of the evidence Mr. Cullen argued in a &s;train of very ingenious rea|&s;oning, amounting to nothing that could in the mo&s;t di&s;tant manner, affect the pri&s;on|er, and, on the&s;e grounds, he hoped, the Jury would be of opinion with him, that the charge had not been &s;ufficiently prov|ed, and would, therefore, acquit the pri|&s;oner.</P>
<P>Mr. Cullen pleaded the cau&s;e of his un|fortunate client with a zeal and ability that did him great honour.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>An&s;truther,</HI> on the part of the crown, replied. He &s;aid he was exceedingly &s;or|ry
<PB N="83" REF="027815_0081_0FD64D6CE8A68650">
to &s;ay, that from his opinion of the evi|dence produced, the charge was complete|ly proved again&s;t the pri&s;oner. He then took a pretty exten&s;ive view of the Law of Trea&s;on, in which he differed very much from Mr. Cullen: he &s;aid, it was by no means the ca&s;e of <HI>Con&s;tructive Trea&s;on,</HI> but a deliberate plan to overturn the govern|ment and Con&s;titution of this country, and therefore came fairly under that part of the &s;tatute of Edward III. of compa&s;&s;ing and imagining the death of the King. He next proceeded to the evidence produced, be|ginning at the fir&s;t motion of a de&s;ign to call a &s;econd Convention, which de&s;ign he &s;aid, was clearly and di&s;tinctly proved. The next part of the evidence was the pri|&s;oner's conduct as a member of the com|mittees of Union and Ways and Means, who&s;e views Mr. Cullen &s;aid were &s;olely to promote the cau&s;e of reform; but he dif|fered very much from him with regard to this. Mr. An&s;truther &s;aid, for taking the corre&s;pondence of Hardy and Skirving; the proceedings of the Briti&s;h Convention; the meetings held at the Globe Tavern, and Chalk Farm, upon the principles held out
<PB N="84" REF="027815_0082_0FD64D702CF29780">
by them&s;elves, and upon who&s;e re&s;olutions tho&s;e committees acted. what was their language? Was it to petition the King, or petition Parliament?&mdash;No! it was, as all their proceedings bear, to do &s;omething &s;tronger than to petition&mdash;It was to effect their purpo&s;e by <HI>force,</HI> which they &s;aid pe|titioning had not been able to do. There could be no doubt this was trea&s;onable, and, the evidence fully ju&s;tified him in &s;aying the pri&s;oner had acceded to every particu|lar. He next adverted to the plan of tak|ing the Ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, &amp;c. which plan no doubt was Watt's&mdash;but the pri&s;on|er did not di&s;&s;ent from that plan, as Mac-Ewen and Bonthorn had done, nor ab&s;ent him&s;elf from the committees; but, on the contrary, he along with Watt employed Orrock to make the pikes&mdash;paid money to Brown for making them&mdash;to Fairley to enable him to go to the We&s;t country upon their bu&s;ine&s;s. In &s;hort, the pri&s;oner com|pletely acceded to every part of Watt's plan; and be&s;ide s all this, the evidence ful|ly proved, that a pike was found in the pri|&s;oner's hou&s;e, and that he was concerned in circulating the &s;editious hand-bill, ten|ding
<PB N="85" REF="027815_0083_0FD64D72D9369700">
to debauch the mind of the Fencibles of this country; a copy of which hand-bill was clearly traced to the pri&s;oner. Mr. An&s;truther now took notice of the great pains that had been taken by &s;ome evil-minded people to &s;educe the lower ranks in this country from their duty and allegiance; and re&s;pecting this he gave an elegant quo|tation from the Roman Hi&s;torian Livy, the purport of which was, that when the lower orders of the people ro&s;e again&s;t the Con|&s;tituent Authority of a country, the con&s;e|quence was, that nothing but anarchy and confu&s;ion en&s;ued, and that country was completely wretched. He concluded with &s;aying, that no doubt remained in his mind, that the charge was completely proved; if, however, the Jury thought otherwi&s;e, he would be happy at the acquittal of the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Mr. An&s;truther &s;poke an hour and fifty minutes, in a cool, deliberate, and elegant manner, and was li&s;tened to with the great|e&s;t attention by all pre&s;ent in court.</P>
<P>The Lord Pre&s;ident then proceeded to charge the Jury. He began with &s;aying, at a future period it would no doubt &s;urpri&s;e po&s;terity to hear, that in this enlightened age crimes &s;uch as that charged on the pri|&s;oner, could be committed. This coun|try
<PB N="86" REF="027815_0084_0FD64D7433EE5F60">
was not now what it had been &s;ome hundred years ago, when civil liberty was ill under&s;tood, when agriculture and com|merce were not attended to, and when the nobles and heads of clans u&s;urped a de&s;potic power over their va&s;&s;als and dependants. Then nothing was heard but family broils, and endle&s;s quarrels for power and plun|der.&mdash;Happily, things were now changed for the better&mdash;the power of the nobles was re&s;tricted, commerce, agriculture, and arts flouri&s;hed, and the people, from idle|ne&s;s and poverty, were rich and indu&s;tri|ous. Was it not a&s;toni&s;hing then, &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, that a period when the country was &s;o pro&s;perous, di&s;contents &s;hould ari&s;e from cau&s;es, of which our forefathers had never thought or heard; doctrines &s;hould be broached, which, if acted upon, would completely &s;ubvert all order in &s;ociety, and plunge this country into all the mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s which &s;o unhappily prevailed in a neighbouring nation.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this, his lord&s;hip read an ex|tract from a &s;peech delivered in the Iri&s;h Parliament, and a quotation from an emi|nent author, who tells the following &s;tory:&mdash;Suppo&s;e, &s;ays the author, a &s;hip went to &s;ea completely manned; the crew acting upon the&s;e new principles &s;ay, Why is this
<PB N="87" REF="027815_0085_0FD64D780B4CAB70">
man captain? Why is this man at the helm? Are we not his equals, and are not our abi|lities equally good with the per&s;on at the helm?&mdash;From words they proceed to ac|tions, and deprive the officers of their com|mand; they then elect others to &s;ucceed them from among them&s;elves, throw off all re&s;traint, get drunk, and in con&s;equence of this the ve&s;&s;el drives among rocks, is lo&s;t and every per&s;on on board peri&s;hes. Such, &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, mu&s;t be the ca&s;e if igno|rant men, who will not obey the whole&s;ome re&s;traints of Law, were to a&s;&s;ume to them|&s;elves the Legi&s;lative and Executive Pow|er of a Country.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip next proceeded to give a clear and di&s;tinct view of the Laws of Trea&s;on, in particular that &s;tatute upon which his indictment was laid. He &s;aid, that it was a happy thing for this country, that at the Union the Trea&s;on Laws of both countries were made one, as it prevented all uncertainty about them; the Trea&s;on Laws being as well under&s;tood as any part of the crimal Juri&s;prudence of this king|dom.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip then commented upon the different parts of the evidence, pointing out with great preci&s;ion and candour what was for, and what was again&s;t, the pri&s;oner,
<PB N="88" REF="027815_0086_0FD64D7A77186690">
leaveing the whole with the Jury. If they found there was not proof &s;ufficient to con|vict the pri&s;oner, or if there was even a doubt in there minds of his guilt, they ought to acquit him, as mercy &s;hould always lean to the &s;ide of the pri&s;oner; but if on the contrary, they were &s;atisfied of his guilt, then they were to bring in their verdict accordingly.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip &s;poke above an hour, in his u&s;ual able <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> candid manner.</P>
<P>The Jury then withdrew, and after a de|liberation of forty minutes, returned with a verdict&mdash;GUILTY.</P>
