<L>Sacred his Time and Strength and Studies were.</L>
<L>When he, for them, Divine Di&s;cour&s;es made,</L>
<L>He &s;till, as looking on, his Ma&s;ter ey'd;</L>
<L>And thought, to Him, that he mu&s;t give Account:</L>
<L>He thought, he read, he wrote, as &s;oon to die;</L>
<L>And, at his Death, t' appear before his Judge:</L>
<L>And, while preparing thus, he rear'd his Heart;</L>
<L><HI>Great GOD and SAVIOUR, Thy Direction give;</HI></L>
<L><HI>A&s;&s;i&s;t my faltering Efforts for thy Sake;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And with Succe&s;s Divine ble&s;s weak Attempts:</HI></L>

<L>THE <HI>&s;acred Mini&s;ter</HI> is now prepar'd,</L>
<L>And waits the Call of <HI>Nolan In&s;trument:</HI></L>
<L>It rings: It tolls: He gravely walks along,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="012864_0013_0F8B6E134B29D578">And, with Mind Heav'nwards, to his De&s;k repairs:</L>
<L>Reaching that Place, as well as going there,</L>
<L>He lifts his Soul, as flies the winged Dart:</L>
<L>To Heav'n it goes, &s;olliciting its Aid,</L>
<L>And a&s;king it <HI>Pro&s;perity to &s;end.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, with well furni&s;h'd Mind and warmed Heart,</L>
<L>He pours out &s;entimental, cordial Prayers;</L>
<L>Such as no Reader of a Book can pour.</L>
<L>Infatuation yet will keep it's Ground.</L>
<L>A well known Liturgy, the Spawn of <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>Mu&s;t yet be us'd: And yet the piteous Prie&s;ts,</L>
<L>Who have no Praying Powers, or none dare move,</L>
<L>A formal Piety encourage will:</L>
<L>Which, though Devotion's Name and Form it wear;</L>
<L>Tis not the Thing: For tho&s;e confin'd to Forms</L>
<L>Mu&s;t to low Words of others &s;ink their Minds,</L>
<L>And, with &s;unk Minds, old Terms mu&s;t mumble o'er.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not &s;uch <HI>Coele&s;tius:</HI> He no Crutches needs.</L>
<L>Pinion'd with Faith and Love he &s;oars aloft,</L>
<L>And heav'nwards bears his Flock on Eagle's Wings:</L>
<L>They gladly mount, and think it good to ri&s;e;</L>
<L>Nor willing are to &s;ink to Things below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now the Mini&s;ter, when he has &s;ung</L>
<L>With tuned Heart and Voice his LORD's high Prai&s;e,</L>
<L>Ri&s;es the Me&s;&s;ages of Heav'n to &s;peak.</L>
<L><HI>The&s;e</HI> from the Oracles Divine he took:</L>
<L>Nor does ever a Di&s;cour&s;e produce,</L>
<L>Wherein he does not fairly &s;hew, how Men</L>
<L>May come to GOD by CHRIST, and ble&s;&s;ed prove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="012864_0014_0F8B6E13FB9042B0">
<L>The Manner of his &s;peaking is mo&s;t plain;</L>
<L>And yet adapted to the Truths he brings.</L>
<L>When he Religion's Doctrines, and its Laws,</L>
<L>Explains and urges, placid is his Face:</L>
<L>And his whole Air &s;hews &s;orth his Mind &s;erene.</L>
<L>If he the Promi&s;es of Grace unfolds,</L>
<L>He's all alive, by quickning Motives rais'd:</L>
<L>And, when the Terrors of Almighty Wrath</L>
<L>He would di&s;play, he &s;peaks with potent Voice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quite &s;eemly too his Actings all appear:</L>
<L>Not like to tho&s;e, which <HI>Raphael</HI> drew for <HI>Paul,</HI></L>
<L>That He might &s;hew, with high uplifted Hands,</L>
<L>His high Di&s;like of Vile Idolatry,</L>
<L>Which in vain <HI>Athens</HI> mightily prevail'd:</L>
<L>Much le&s;s will he in Chri&s;tian Temples u&s;e</L>
<L>The trifling Ge&s;tures of <HI>the Theatre.</HI></L>
<L>As, in di&s;cour&s;ing, greatly he will &s;corn</L>
<L><HI>Of human Wi&s;dom the enticing Words;</HI></L>
<L>So, in his Method of Delivery,</L>
<L>He will no <HI>Garrick</HI> for a Pattern take.</L>
<L>But, as his Subjects variou&s;ly demand,</L>
<L>He will or calm or vehement appear</L>
<L>In Word and Action, as may well become</L>
<L><HI>The Words of JESUS and eternal Life.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So &s;peaks he, as to Men, form'd from above,</L>
<L>Redeem'd by JESUS, Candidates for Bli&s;s,</L>
<L>And yet in Danger of perpetual Woes,</L>
<L>The&s;e, by per&s;ua&s;ive Motives, taught by CHRIST,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="012864_0015_0F8B6E14E1A63A30">He wooes to Wi&s;dom, Virtue, Happine&s;s.</L>
<L>And &s;ince mere Sua&s;ions will not gain the&s;e Ends,</L>
<L>He lifts his Prayer, that Energy Divine</L>
<L>May, to his Toil, a pro&s;perous I&s;&s;ue give.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Labour done; he then quite &s;pent returns</L>
<L>To ble&s;s his Hou&s;ehold: And, though yet fatigu'd,</L>
<L>He's &s;till for Labour: For he loves his Work;</L>
<L>Nor thinks, that all is done, while Part remains:</L>
<L>This Part at Home, or, he, abroad, performs:</L>
<L>For, by his Lips and Walk, he preaches &s;till,</L>
<L>And thus <HI>the Word of Life holds forth</HI> to all.</L>

<L><HI>THE Mini&s;ter,</HI> as <HI>Preaching,</HI> has been &s;een:</L>
<L>Now let us view his <HI>Conduct and his Ways.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As he him&s;elf, with all his mental Powers</L>
<L>And his whole Body to his GOD has giv'n;</L>
<L>He hence employs him&s;elf and all for GOD,</L>
<L>As bought for HIM, and for HIM &s;et apart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He therefore won't &s;pend Time, as many do.</L>
<L>To earthly Men and Things he'll be no Dupe.</L>
<L>True he mu&s;t eat and drink and &s;lumbers take;</L>
<L>And he &s;ubmits to The&s;e, as Nature claims:</L>
<L>For he well knows, that, by Recruits from The&s;e,</L>
<L>He, to &s;erve GOD and Men, is fitted well.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="17" REF="012864_0016_0F8B6E15B133C788">
<L>Friends he would have: But he's afraid of <HI>The&s;e,</HI></L>
<L>Le&s;t they &s;hould &s;teal away his precious Time:</L>
<L>Therefore not long with them will he abide.</L>
<L>And, if to him they friendly Vi&s;its make,</L>
<L>Them he'll not urge to make their Vi&s;its long;</L>
<L>For he wants Aids, not Hindrances, of Works.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If men of Wealth and Influence him invite</L>
<L>To their full Hou&s;es, he will &s;ometimes go;</L>
<L>But then to an&s;wer kind and pious Ends:</L>
<L>Yet often he will not their Calls accept;</L>
<L>When, mode&s;t, he can fair Excu&s;es make.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, when or Friends beguile or great ones force;</L>
<L>So that, of lo&s;t Time, he may well complain:</L>
<L>Then &s;orrowing he retires; to Work he goes,</L>
<L>And, by fre&s;h Diligence, repairs his Lo&s;s.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Him&s;elf he'll not entangle with the World:</L>
<L>Quite happy he, if he a <HI>Partner</HI> has</L>
<L>That will take, from him, Earth's Incumbrances,</L>
<L>And make him free to mind his great Employ:</L>
<L>But if, not yet, he has his <HI>faithful Mate;</HI></L>
<L>Some <HI>Friend</HI> he'll find t' abate his worldly Cares.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If Sickne&s;&s;es off from his Studies take,</L>
<L>And pains afflictive Mole&s;tation bring,</L>
<L>From The&s;e, he will the be&s;t of Le&s;&s;ons learn:</L>
<L>And, when, by good Advice and prudent Care,</L>
<L>From <HI>The&s;e</HI> he's freed; he with new Vigour ther.</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="012864_0017_0F8B6E166B0AA958">Goes to his Labours, and makes &s;uch Di&s;patch,</L>

<L>When Sickne&s;&s;es do, on his People, &s;eize,</L>
<L>And any Sorrows lie upon their Hearts;</L>
<L>The Mini&s;ter will then &s;weet Kindne&s;s &s;hew,</L>
<L>And, by his Vi&s;its, bear away their Pains:</L>
<L>But to tho&s;e, chiefly, quite <HI>of weary Minds;</HI></L>
<L>As Sinners great, who know their mighty Guilt,</L>
<L>And hence their GOD dread as their Enemy;</L>

<L>He'll &s;ay; <HI>Not willing is the GOD of Grace,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That any peri&s;h, but that all repent:</HI></L>
<L>And He <HI>&s;o lov'd the world, He gave his Son,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That who on Him believes with cordial Faith</HI></L>
<L><HI>Peri&s;h &s;hould not, but have eternal Life:</HI></L>
<L>And, <HI>of this Life, our Je&s;us has the Words;</HI></L>

<L>To teach and rule and &s;ave them perfectly:</L>

<L>Then come to Him, and <HI>of his fulne&s;s</HI> take:</L>
<L>And, in his Favour, <HI>let your Soul delight.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All this, and more, the learn'd one &s;oftly &s;peaks:</L>
<L>Whence the dejected Patient, with rais'd Head</L>
<L>And Brow relax'd and anxious Brea&s;t remov'd,</L>
<L>Ble&s;&s;es the Man, that calm'd his ruffled Soul,</L>
<L>And ble&s;&s;es GOD his Saviour for the Man.</L>
