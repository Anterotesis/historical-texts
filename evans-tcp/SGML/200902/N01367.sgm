<P>THE Text I now Read, had not been Readd unto you, if the Providence of God had not furni&s;hed me with an <HI>Ex|traordinary Commentary</HI> upon it.

<PB N="4" REF="001624_0003_0FB3E35A2574F570">a Ju&s;tice to the <HI>Memory</HI> of a <HI>Ju&s;t One,</HI> whom we all agree to Honour as a <HI>Mother I&s;rael:</HI> And for whom we are this Day, <HI>Bow'd down heavily, as One that Mourneth for his Mother.</HI> A Per&s;on, who was One of the <HI>Fir&s;t-born,</HI> if not the <HI>very Fir&s;t</HI> of her Sex that was Born, in this famous <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the <HI>Engli&s;h-America:</HI> And who de&s;erves to be Ho|nourably Mentioned, as long as <HI>BOS|TON</HI> &s;hall endure, which, I hope, will be unto the &s;econd Coming of our Sa|viour. May it be an happy Omen, that <HI>Many Daughters</HI> of this our <HI>New-Engli&s;h Jeru&s;alem</HI> will <HI>do Virtuou&s;ly,</HI> when we &s;ee the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> of them, like another <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">am,</HI> (her Names-&s;ake) leading them in the Prai&s;es of God.</P>
<P>I will not lo&s;e the Sight of <HI>Her,</HI> tho' I will for an Hour &s;eem to addre&s;s no|thing but the Text, that I have cho&s;en on her Occa&s;ion: A Text, wherein I &s;ee both the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings of the Upper-Springs,</HI> and the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings of the Nether-Spring,</HI> flowing unto us. Our God has this in His Order for our Meeting this Day; <HI>Gather the People together, and I will give them Water.</HI> O Congregation, Sing here|upon
<PB N="5" REF="001624_0004_0FB3E35BB07C0878">the Song of <HI>I&s;rael; Spring up, O Well; Sing ye unto it!</HI></P>
<P>I verily believe, that Ble&s;&s;ings to be received in <HI>another World,</HI> are here en|gaged unto the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> But, I find, Interpreters do generally under&s;tand certain Ble&s;&s;ings to be received in <HI>this World.</HI> And I know, That <HI>Godline&s;s</HI> has <HI>the Promi&s;e of the Life that now is,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Life that is to come.</HI> I am wil|ling &s;o far to comply with the <HI>Voice of the Board</HI> of Interpreters, as to employ fir&s;t a Di&s;cour&s;e on certain Ble&s;&s;ings, which Piety will obtain for us, in the <HI>Life that now is.</HI> But I fore&s;ee, that be|fore I have done, the Ble&s;&s;ings which Piety will obtain for us in the <HI>Life that is to come,</HI> will break in upon our Me|ditations. We &s;hall be unavoidably, and as it were by Surprize, led into the Me|ditations of them.</P>
<P>You may behold here, a <HI>Conjunction</HI> of Ble&s;&s;ings: An <HI>A&s;pect</HI> full of Happine&s;s. One is, An <HI>Ea&s;y Soul.</HI> The other is, An <HI>Happy Seed.</HI> Indeed there is a very great <HI>Adaptation</HI> in the mention of the&s;e toge|ther. They are very <HI>Aptly</HI> joined. Our departing <HI>Soul</HI> does not fall into <HI>Unea&s;i|ne&s;s</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="001624_0005_0FB3E35D2F001AC0">on any Point more &s;en&s;ibly, than the Condition of our <HI>Seed.</HI> That which makes us very <HI>Unea&s;y,</HI> is, our Thoughts, <HI>What may become of our Children.</HI> O God|fearing Man, <HI>Fear nothing;</HI> let thy <HI>Soul dwell at Ea&s;e;</HI> thy <HI>Offspring</HI> &s;hall be well provided for.</P>
<P>This is the DOCTRINE that is now ready for you.</P>
<P><HI>To Live in the true Fear of God, is the way to Lodge in a &s;weet Ea&s;e of Soul: And they that fear God have this good Thing particularly to make them Ea&s;y, that their Children after them &s;hall fare the better for them.</HI></P>
<P>&para; We will begin with the Advan|age which our Piety will bring to <HI>Our &s;elves:</HI> The Advantage of, <HI>An ea&s;y Soul The Fear of the Lord will be the Ea&s;e of the Soul that has it.</HI> Piety will re&s;cue the Soul from <HI>Di&s;turbance,</HI> from <HI>Vexation,</HI> from &s;uch Troubles and &s;uch Tumults, as will el&s;e Di&s;compo&s;e it wonderfully.</P>
<P>We will fir&s;t of all take Notice of &s;ome <HI>General In&s;tructions,</HI> about the <HI>Ea&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="001624_0006_0FB3E35EB2391228">of Soul</HI> which Piety will be attended withal. If Mini&s;ters would accurately con&s;ult the Languages wherein our God has written His Oracles unto us, they would often find &s;uch <HI>Hints,</HI> as would otherwi&s;e pa&s;s unob&s;erved, tho' mo&s;t highly worthy of Ob&s;ervation. Here is an In&s;tance. There is an In&s;tructive Elegance and Empha&s;is, yea, a Variety of In&s;tructions, in that Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>His Soul &s;hall dwell at Ea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t. The <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> of Mind obtained by Piety, will be a <HI>La&s;ting Ea&s;e.</HI> Our Soul will <HI>Dwell</HI> in it. Our <HI>Abode</HI> will be in <HI>Ea&s;e.</HI> We &s;hall have an <HI>Abiding Ea&s;e.</HI> There will be a <HI>Continuance</HI> of our <HI>Ea&s;e.</HI> We enter into it, at our <HI>Fir&s;t Conver&s;ion</HI> unto Piety; we &s;hall remain in it, unto all <HI>Eternity.</HI> It won't be the &s;hort Blaze of <HI>Thorns Crackling under a Pot.</HI> When, I pray, when will it come to an End? Not until the <HI>Soul</HI> it &s;elf come to an End: A Lamp of God, that &s;hall Burn forever. The Account is a <HI>Joyful</HI> One, a <HI>Plea&s;ant</HI> One: P&s;al. XVI. 11. <HI>Fulne&s;s of Joy, and Plea&s;ures forevermore.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. The <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> of Mind attain'd by Piety, is to be enjoy'd in the <HI>Dark|e&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="001624_0007_0FB3E36037877FF8">Time</HI> that pa&s;&s;es over us. Our Soul &s;hall <HI>&s;pend the Night</HI> in it. This is the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Word u&s;ed here. When 'tis with us, a <HI>Night</HI> of Darkne&s;s and Sorrow, even <HI>then</HI> we &s;hall be <HI>at Ea&s;e.</HI> There &s;hall ari&s;e unto us <HI>Light in Darkne&s;s.</HI> We &s;hall meet with &s;uch Things as will give us <HI>Ea&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Revive us, when we Walk in the mid&s;t of Trouble.</HI> When 'tis a very <HI>Dark Time</HI> with us, and a <HI>Midnight</HI> of Confu&s;ion is on our Af|fairs, and our Fle&s;h can <HI>See nothing</HI> but Hazard and Horror on every &s;ide, <HI>Now</HI> is the Time that Piety will give <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> unto us. It will do that Thing; Job XXXV. 10. <HI>Give Songs in the Night.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. The <HI>Soul</HI> is the <HI>Seat</HI> of that <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> which is attain'd by Piety. Our <HI>Body</HI> may be <HI>ill at Ea&s;e,</HI> notwith&s;tanding our Piety. A Pious Man may have a <HI>Di&s;ea&s;ed Body;</HI> a <HI>Body,</HI> that &s;hall be as they &s;aid the Laborious <HI>Calvin's</HI> was, <HI>An Ho&s;pital of Di&s;ea&s;es;</HI> a <HI>Body</HI> that &s;hall <HI>Feel,</HI> as <HI>Timothies</HI> did, <HI>Often Infirmities. Lord, One whom thou Love&s;t, is Sick!</HI> But the <HI>Soul</HI> may be <HI>at Ea&s;e,</HI> when the <HI>Body</HI> is in Pain. When the <HI>Outward Man</HI> is even broken to Pieces, Piety will enable us to
<PB N="9" REF="001624_0008_0FB3E361B3776E28">&s;ay &s;till, <HI>My Mind is Ea&s;y!</HI> Our <HI>Soul</HI> &s;hall be <HI>Sedate,</HI> yea, <HI>Solac'd,</HI> when our <HI>Out|ward Man</HI> is never &s;o much off the Hinges. If Piety would only Ea&s;e the <HI>Body,</HI> we &s;hould call it, <HI>A Phy&s;ician of no Value.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Soul,</HI> the <HI>Soul,</HI> that mo&s;t wants to be made <HI>Ea&s;y. Ea&s;ine&s;s</HI> in the <HI>Outward Man</HI> indeed cannot be expected here: This is a World that has <HI>Thorns</HI> every where growing in it. But now, the Boa&s;t of Piety is that; <HI>Luk.</HI> I. 46, 47. <HI>My Soul does Magnify the Lord; my Spirit has Rejoiced in God my Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>We will now go on in the next Place, to <HI>Enquire</HI> more Particularly. What is that <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> which Piety brings to the <HI>Soul?</HI> And, Whence that <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Soul</HI> ari&s;es? Diver&s;e MAXIMS of PIETY are to be taken into our Con&s;ideration, and for our Encouragement in the cour&s;e of Piety. By the&s;e MAXIMS, the <HI>Enquiry</HI> will be &s;ufficiently an&s;wered.</P>
<P N="1">I. Piety brings us to <HI>Dwell</HI> in a <HI>Good State:</HI> And, Oh! the Glorious <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> which belongs to the <HI>Soul</HI> of that Man, who finds him&s;elf to be fixed in a <HI>Good State</HI> for Perpetuity! What we render, <HI>His Soul &s;hall Dwell at Ea&s;e,</HI> is in the

The <HI>New Covenant</HI> is a <HI>Good</HI> Covenant. It is called, <HI>The Bet|ter Covenant.</HI> Piety &s;ettles us under the <HI>Covenant of Grace.</HI> A Soul <HI>&s;ettled</HI> under the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> may Sing that Song; P&s;al.

<P N="2">II. To <HI>Dwell</HI> in CHRIST and in GOD, is to <HI>Dwell at Ea&s;e:</HI> Piety brings us to &s;uch a <HI>Dwelling.</HI> It brings to what may be the Ver&s;ion of the Clau&s;e we are upon; <HI>His Soul &s;hall dwell with the GOOD ONE.</HI> And who that is, we know very well. By the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> we come to <HI>Dwell</HI> in the Glorious ONE, who is <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> it &s;elf. The Note of the <HI>Fear of God</HI> is that; <HI>Lord, Toon ha&s;t been our Dwel|ling I lace in all Generations.</HI> Oh! mo&s;t <HI>Ea&s;y Dwelling Flace!</HI> Piety brings us to Dwell in a CHRIST; And &s;o to do, is to <HI>Dwell in a Rock.</HI> The Believer flies

It may be &s;aid unto the Be|liever, what we Read; Num. XXIV. 21. <HI>Strong is thy Dwelling-Place, and thou put|te&s;t thy Ne&s;t in a Rock.</HI> Oh! the <HI>Safety</HI> of &s;uch a Dwelling!

<P N="3">III.

<P N="4">IV. <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> brings <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> to the Soul, by <HI>Healing</HI> the <HI>Di&s;tempers</HI> of the Soul. The Fruit of Piety is an <HI>Healed Soul;</HI> therefore an <HI>Ea&s;y</HI> one. An <HI>Holy</HI> Soul, is an <HI>Healed Soul.</HI> The <HI>Fear of God</HI> is <HI>Health</HI> to the Soul, and <HI>Marrow</HI> to the Mind; It makes an <HI>Healthy</HI> Soul. The <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> of the Soul, are the Things which will not let it be <HI>Ea&s;y;</HI> Things which break the <HI>Re&s;t</HI> of it. Hence 'tis that we Read; I&s;a. LVII. 20, 21. <HI>The Wicked are like the troubled Sea, which cannot Re&s;t; There is no Peace, &s;aith my God unto the Wicked.</HI> Piety <HI>Cures</HI> our <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions;</HI> Moderates them; Regulates them. In Piety the Soul is brought into <HI>Order;</HI> The <HI>Di&s;orders</HI> of the Soul are mightily Rectified. This makes an <HI>Ea&s;y Soul.</HI> A <HI>Lu&s;t</HI> in the Soul, is a <HI>Thorn</HI> in the Soul. The Soul cannot be at <HI>Ea&s;e,</HI> while a <HI>Lu&s;t</HI> is Inflaming and

Piety pulls out the <HI>Thorn.</HI> Our Holy Saviour does in the Piety which He Works in us, <HI>Redeem us from all Iniquity.</HI> Piety will teach the Soul to <HI>Love</HI> nothing in this World <HI>Inordinately,</HI> and makes us willing to <HI>deny our &s;elves</HI> of every thing that God would have us go without.

<P N="5">V. Piety puts the Soul upon that <HI>Cour&s;e,</HI> which <HI>U&s;ually,</HI> yea, <HI>Naturally</HI> brings <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> to the Soul. The <HI>Fear of God</HI>

<P>&para; But we will proceed now, to the Advantage which our Piety will bring
<PB N="25" REF="001624_0024_0FB3E37A70BCE208">to <HI>Ours:</HI> The Advantage of an <HI>Happy Seed. Good Men have this good Thing to make them Ea&s;y; their Children after them &s;hall fare the better for them.</HI></P>
<P>Let us Inform our &s;elves upon what Account!</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. The Piety of <HI>Parents</HI> does bring their <HI>Children</HI> into the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God. Pious Parents give up <HI>Them&s;elves</HI> unto God, in His <HI>Covenant.</HI> But then, they give up their <HI>Children</HI> as well as <HI>Them|&s;elves;</HI> their Children as <HI>a part</HI> of Them|&s;elves. The Re&s;ult is that; Gen. XVII. 7. <HI>An everla&s;ting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and unto thy Seed after thee.</HI> Oh! the <HI>Rich Inheritance</HI> of the <HI>Children</HI> thus brought into the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God, and of Grace! To <HI>Inherit the Earth,</HI> yea, to Inherit the whole World, is not &s;o much as to have the great God in <HI>Covenant</HI> with us, for our <HI>Inheritance.</HI> It follows; If the&s;e Children Die in their <HI>Infancy,</HI> they have a Claim to all the Ble&s;&s;ings of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> in the Eternal World. When the great GOD &s;ays, <HI>I will be the God of the&s;e Children,</HI> He intends, <HI>I will bring them to a part in the Heavenly City.</HI> O Pious Parents, your Dead Chil|dren
<PB N="26" REF="001624_0025_0FB3E37C0203C328">are but gone before you, into the Suburbs, and &s;ome Foreta&s;tes of that <HI>Inheritance,</HI> which you have &s;ecured for them. Yea, this Clau&s;e, <HI>They &s;hall Inhe|rit the Earth,</HI> mu&s;t be a little more nicely thought upon. There is an <HI>Earth</HI> to be <HI>Inherited</HI> by the&s;e <HI>Children:</HI> Even that <HI>New Earth,</HI> wherein &s;hall <HI>dwell Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> that <HI>New Earth,</HI> over which they &s;hall <HI>Reign, of whom is the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Children of Abraham,</HI> are to be <HI>Heirs of the World;</HI> But in the <HI>World to come.</HI> When you Read of, <HI>In|heriting the Earth,</HI> O Saints, look for|ward, as far as <HI>that</HI> World, for the Ex|plaining, and the Fulfilling of it. If the&s;e Children &s;hould &s;urvive their <HI>Infancy,</HI> the <HI>Covenant</HI> has en&s;ured this, That they &s;hall have an <HI>Offer</HI> of the Go&s;pel; That Chri&s;t, and Grace, and Heaven, &s;hall be <HI>Offered</HI> unto them. <HI>Unto them fir&s;t</HI> is that Saviour &s;ent, that would <HI>Ble&s;s them in turning them from their Iniquities.</HI> O In|valuable Priviledge!</P>
<P>Secondly. Piety in Parents, does di&s;|po&s;e them to pur&s;ue a <HI>Good Education</HI> for their <HI>Children.</HI> Of a Pious Parent, it was &s;aid in Gen. XVIII. 19. <HI>I know him,
<PB N="27" REF="001624_0026_0FB3E37E34A6E990">that he will Command his Children, and they &s;hall keep the way of the Lord.</HI> Even &s;o, Such a Parent, <HI>I know him;</HI> He will in&s;til the <HI>Principles of Religion</HI> into his Children: They &s;hall be well Cate|chized Children. Such a Parent, <HI>I know him,</HI> He will inform his Children how to fly from <HI>Sin,</HI> and turn to <HI>God,</HI> and clo&s;e with <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and walk in a Con|formity to the Doctrines of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI> Such a Parent, <HI>I know him,</HI> He will Advi&s;e his Children again&s;t the Pathes of the De&s;troyer, and re&s;train them and re&s;cue them with all po&s;&s;ible Agony from tho&s;e De&s;tructive Ways. 'Tis a va&s;t Felicity, to have &s;uch an <HI>Education!</HI> But there is one Point of <HI>Education</HI> more, that &s;uch a Parent will be&s;tow upon his Children. He will find out a fit <HI>Employment</HI> for his Children: He will have them taught &s;ome <HI>Employ|ment,</HI> by which they may <HI>Inherit</HI> as much of the <HI>Earth</HI> as may be needful for them, and they may be U&s;eful in their Gene|ration: He will not bear, that they &s;hould be brought up in <HI>Idlene&s;s,</HI> and prove meer <HI>Drones</HI> in the Hive of the Common-wealth. He makes to the
<PB N="28" REF="001624_0027_0FB3E37FC57AF058">World, an Honourable Pre&s;ent of <HI>Well-educated Children!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. Piety is a <HI>Prayerful</HI> &s;ort of a Thing. Pious Parents will <HI>Pray</HI> for their <HI>Children.</HI> Pious Parents are <HI>Praying</HI> Pa|rents. They lay up a <HI>Stock of Prayers</HI> for their Children. We Read of &s;uch an One; Job I. 5. <HI>He offered Sacrifices accor|ding to the Number of all his Children.&mdash; Thus did Job continually.</HI> The Prayers of an <HI>Abraham</HI> for his <HI>I&s;hmael, O my God, That my Son may Live in thy Sight!</HI> The Prayers of a <HI>David</HI> for his <HI>Solomon, O my God, That my Son may have a perfect Heart given to him!</HI> There is a mighty Effica|cy in the&s;e Prayers. They <HI>avail much;</HI> Pious Parents are always <HI>Travailing</HI> for their Children with them. Children, The&s;e <HI>Prayers</HI> will not be lo&s;t. It will be <HI>your Fault,</HI> if they be! The <HI>Relations</HI> that have been given in the Hi&s;tories of the Church, concerning the Succe&s;s of Prayer made by Pious Parents for their Children, before and after the Days of <HI>Monica</HI> have been many and Marvel|lous. I will now &s;ingle out One, which perhaps you have not met withal. I know the Name of a Worthy Man, who liv'd
<PB N="29" REF="001624_0028_0FB3E381365A5A38">&s;ome while &s;ince in the County of <HI>Corn|wal;</HI> and who had a Son wandring from God, and from him, under a very Vici|ous Character. He procured a Number of Mini&s;ters to join with him, in a <HI>Day of Prayer</HI> for the Conver&s;ion of that <HI>Pro|digal Son.</HI> On <HI>that very Day,</HI> Behold, the Prodigal returned, with a new Temper and Bia&s;s of Soul given to him. God ble&s;&s;ed a Calamity that befel him, for his Awakening and Conver&s;ion; And from <HI>that very Day</HI> he became a New Creature, and a Servant of God. After|wards this Worthy Man, when he lay a Dying, &s;aid, <HI>I have Ten Children, where|of Nine are in Chri&s;t; God has converted Nine of them to &s;erious Piety. I Die Be|lieving for the Tenth; He al&s;o &s;hall be brought home unto God.</HI> And this al&s;o was accom|pli&s;hed. Verily, The Children of &s;uch Parents, are not &s;oon to be de&s;paired of!</P>
<P>Fourthly. The <HI>Piety</HI> of <HI>Parents,</HI> does often be&s;peak <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> for their <HI>Children.</HI> We Read; Prov. XX. 7. <HI>The Ju&s;t Man walketh in his Integrity; His Children are ble&s;&s;ed after him.</HI> 'Tis often &s;o; Pious Parents have their Piety often <HI>Rewarded</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="001624_0029_0FB3E382B4F76AF0">in the Pro&s;perity of their <HI>Children.</HI> They get their E&s;tates Hone&s;tly; they wear well; their <HI>Children Inherit the Earth</HI> which they leave unto them; the <HI>Third Heir</HI> it may be Rejoices in what was left by his Grandfather. More than this; <HI>Pious Parents</HI> devote a <HI>Good Portion</HI> of their E&s;tates to <HI>Pious</HI> U&s;es. Yea, I mu&s;t &s;ay unto you, They ALL do &s;o! <HI>I</HI> &s;ay again, whatever Havock the A&s;&s;ertion may make among &s;ome <HI>Covetous Hypo|crites,</HI> They ALL do &s;o. Now, this lays up a <HI>Good Portion</HI> for their <HI>Children.</HI> The Parents <HI>devi&s;e Liberal Things;</HI> the Children reap the Harve&s;t of that Libe|rality. The <HI>Alms</HI> di&s;pen&s;ed by the Pa|rents, are a <HI>Seed</HI> &s;own in the Earth for the Children. 'Tis to <HI>ca&s;t the Bread-corn into moi&s;t Ground,</HI> [which we are directed to do, Eccl. XI. 1. For 'tis to be Tran|&s;lated &s;o:] It will <HI>be &s;een after many Days.</HI> The Children will have the Crop. After their <HI>Parents</HI> are laid in the <HI>Earth,</HI> even then the Children, as the Reward of their Piety, do <HI>Inherit the Earth.</HI> If the knowledge of their Children do|ing well, &s;hould arrive unto the <HI>Souls</HI> of the Parents <HI>Dwelling at Ea&s;e,</HI>&mdash; But
<PB N="31" REF="001624_0030_0FB3E384293DCCE0">the&s;e are <HI>Secret Things.</HI> And I know, of whom it is &s;aid, <HI>His Sons come to Ho|nour, and he knoweth it not.</HI></P>
