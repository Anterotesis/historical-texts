<HEAD>The Epi&s;tle TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_THE <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> is the &s;upe|rior Faculty in Man, by which he is rai&s;ed above the Re&s;t of the vi&s;ible Creation: And as this Power is the Glory of hu|mane Nature; &s;o the Perfection and Glory of this con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>Knowledge of GOD.</HI> All other Knowledge com|pared with this is mean and trivial; and will ne|ver make us wi&s;er or better, unle&s;s placed in Sub|ordination and Sub&s;erviency to our Acquaintance with the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD. This Knowledge is not perfected in a bare <HI>Contemplation of the</HI> DEITY; but when true and genuine will exerci&s;e <HI>Domi|nion in the Soul,</HI> and transform it into the Image of Divine Purity and Glory. Hence all the vital Acts of Religion are either comprehended herein, or do flow here-from.</P>
<P>To attain this Knowledge is our great <HI>Work</HI> on Earth; and the Perfection of it is re&s;erved for our <HI>Reward</HI> in the expected World of Happine&s;s:
<PB N="ii" REF="004489_0003_100D57469F586230">Where <HI>to &s;ee GOD as He is,</HI> and to be <HI>like Him</HI> will be found to be Life Eternal. And the higher our Improvements are herein in this Life, the more of Heaven do we at pre&s;ent <HI>enjoy,</HI> and the greater is our <HI>Preparation</HI> for the happy State of <HI>Vi&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>NOW nothing is more nece&s;&s;ary to our right Knowledge of GOD than that all our Enquiries after this <HI>Glorious</HI> BEING be temper'd with a live|ly Sen&s;e that <HI>Incomprehen&s;iblene&s;s is a Divine At|tribute;</HI> and that it is the <HI>&s;ole Prerogative of</HI> HIM, <HI>who&s;e Under&s;tanding is Infinite, fully and adequately to know Him&s;elf.</HI> We mu&s;t remember that the mo&s;t <HI>exalted</HI> and <HI>enlarged Conceptions</HI> of the uncreated Excellencies of the Divine Nature, which our Minds can form, when &s;tretch'd to their utmo&s;t Capacity, are <HI>Inadequate</HI> to their &s;ub|lime Subject, and fall infinitely &s;hort of the Glory of tho&s;e Perfections, which are concentred in the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> and &s;hine forth in the glorious <HI>Works</HI> of Nature, Providence and Grace. The <HI>Object</HI> is too va&s;t and bright, and our <HI>Faculties</HI> too &s;hort, weak and limited, to take, or bear, a full and comprehen&s;ive View thereof. The <HI>In|finity</HI> of every Perfection in GOD, and the <HI>Fi|nitene&s;s</HI> of our Powers of Knowledge, between which there is no Proportion, will forever render a <HI>comprehen&s;ive Knowledge</HI> of GOD an utter Im|po&s;&s;ibility. His Excellencies would not be the Perfections of a GOD were they not Infinite, they would not be Infinite could the Creature enter|tain a full View, and form an adequate <HI>Mea</HI> of them. The <HI>e&s;&s;ential Glory</HI> of GOD, if unvailed, would confound and over-power our Under&s;tand|ings
<PB N="iii" REF="004489_0004_100D57498DC7B1D8">with its <HI>in&s;ufferable Brightne&s;s.</HI> What Crea|ture can thus <HI>behold</HI> GOD <HI>and live!</HI> It is in Com|pa&s;&s;ion to our Infirmity that He <HI>holds back the Face of His Throne, and &s;preads a Cloud upon it.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED in the <HI>Future State,</HI> where all faulty Ignorance &s;hall be done away, the Minds of the Ble&s;&s;ed will be rai&s;ed to their full <HI>Strength, Pu|rity</HI> and <HI>Capacity,</HI> and the&s;e filled with the Know|ledge of GOD, which &s;hall render them com|pleatly <HI>ble&s;&s;ed:</HI> Which Knowledge is repre&s;ented to us under the Phra&s;es of <HI>Seeing</HI> GOD <HI>as He is, and Face to Face;</HI> yet this will fall infinitely &s;hort of <HI>Comprehen&s;ion.</HI> For yet there will re|main <HI>infinite Truths,</HI> and <HI>adorable My&s;teries</HI> un|di&s;cover'd for the glorify'd Under&s;tanding to be prying into, and reaching after a fuller Pro&s;pect of, which will render the Knowledge of the Ble&s;|&s;ed <HI>eternally Progre&s;&s;ive;</HI> and yet after all they can't <HI>find out the Almighty to Perfection.</HI> The <HI>Angels,</HI> who excel in Strength, Purity, and Glory, are not here <HI>Comprehen&s;ors;</HI> for there are <HI>Secrets</HI> of Wi&s;dom and Grace which they &s;till <HI>de&s;ire to look into.</HI></P>
<P>HOW much &s;o ever this may <HI>upbraid</HI> the Po|verty and Weakne&s;s of the mo&s;t exalted Crea|ture, it certainly loudly <HI>proclaims</HI> the Excellency of the CREATOR, who&s;e Nature and Perfections are va&s;tly extended beyond the large&s;t Pro&s;pect of a <HI>created Intelligence.</HI></P>
<P>AND this <HI>Article</HI> of the <HI>Incomprehen&s;iblene&s;s</HI> of GOD is not to be look'd on as meerly <HI>Speculative,</HI> to amu&s;e the Mind; but will admirably advance

With what <HI>Humility, Reverence</HI> and <HI>Awe</HI> would they Think and <HI>Speak</HI> of the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD: being &s;en&s;ible that they know not how to <HI>order</HI> their Thoughts or <HI>Speech</HI> of Him <HI>by rea&s;on of Darkne&s;s?</HI> With what <HI>Sub|mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;tration of Spirit</HI> would they ap|proach Him in all the Duties of <HI>Divine Wor&s;hip!</HI> How <HI>mode&s;t</HI> in their <HI>Enquiries</HI> into, and how little Po&s;itive in their <HI>Determinations</HI> concerning, the Secrets of Divine Coun&s;el; which are at pre&s;ent, in a great mea&s;ure, <HI>bid within the Vail?</HI> With what <HI>Silence</HI> and <HI>Re&s;ignation</HI> would they ly be|fore the <HI>Throne</HI> of Divine <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> when in|circled with <HI>Clouds and Darkne&s;s?</HI> Nothing wondring that they can't unfold the dark Riddles of Divine Providence; remembring that GOD's <HI>Judgments are Un&s;earchable, and His Ways pa&s;t finding out.</HI></P>
<P>WERE the Hearts of Chri&s;tians <HI>animated</HI> with the&s;e ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ions of the GOD they have to do with; with what <HI>Aba&s;ement</HI> of Spirit would they reflect upon their mo&s;t perfect Prai&s;e, and be&s;t Services? And with what <HI>Tran&s;ports</HI> of <HI>Admiration, Love</HI> and <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> would they con&s;ider the Conde&s;centions of Heaven to them, and all the Fruits of Divine Care and Love, which daily incircle them?

<P>THE Character of the Reverend <HI>Author,</HI> and his Performances are too bright to receive any Lu&s;tre from my <HI>Recommendation.</HI> However I mu&s;t be allow'd to rejoice in, and to ble&s;s the <HI>great Head of the Church</HI> for, tho&s;e uncommon Gifts His Servant is endow'd with; which appear ob|&s;ervably in the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es.

<P><PB N="vi" REF="004489_0007_100D574F6EED3AB8">
FOR what will be thought &s;uitable to afford <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Heat</HI> to the pious Mind, if <HI>the&s;e Con|templations on</HI> GOD will not?

<P>IN the&s;e we have celebrated the un&s;earchable Greatne&s;s, and Excellencies of GOD, as they &s;hine in the <HI>Works of Nature:</HI> And illu&s;trated by many bright <HI>Hints</HI> drawn from the Glory and Beauty of the <HI>greater and le&s;&s;er World:</HI> In all Parts whereof there appear legible Characters of a Di|vine Power, Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s, that are pa&s;t finding out.</P>

<P>IN a Word, here the Wonders of <HI>Divine Grace</HI> in the Recovery of apo&s;tate Man are a&s;&s;en|ted and di&s;play'd.

THESE exalted and my&s;terious <HI>Doctrines</HI> are here handled with an uncommon Force and Flame of Thought, expre&s;&s;ed mainly in the <HI>Lan|guage of the Divine Oracles,</HI> which gives Life, Beauty, and Solemnity to the Diction.</P>
<P>WHEN the&s;e <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI> were deliver'd from the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> I have good Rea&s;on to think, that they were heard with a &s;ingular Reli&s;h and Satis|faction by a <HI>numerous and judicious Audience.</HI> And this excited me once and again to move the Reverend <HI>Author</HI> to publi&s;h them; that they might become more exten&s;ively &s;erviceable to the grand Intere&s;ts of Religion. I am firmly per&s;waded that the great Aim of the Author in the&s;e <HI>Sermons</HI> was to advance the Glory of GOD and the Good of Souls; I cannot therefore but with an hearty Importunity wi&s;h Pro&s;perity from Heaven to his pious Intentions.</P>
<P>AND may the <HI>Father of Lights,</HI> on whom all Succe&s;s depends, &s;end His <HI>Spirit</HI> to ble&s;s the&s;e Labours of His Servant; that they may be ef|fectual to beget in Chri&s;tians <HI>a more awful Sen&s;e of the Great</HI> GOD, to &s;tir up and cheri&s;h the Life of Devotion in their Souls, to render them more Solemn in all Acts of Wor&s;hip to Him, and more Holy in all Actions of Conver&s;ation before Him.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Minutene&s;s</HI> of &s;ome of the wonderful Works of GOD is un&s;earchable. The <HI>Di&s;coveries</HI> of this kind made by <HI>Micro&s;copes</HI> are a&s;toni&s;hing. In le&s;s far than a <HI>Grain of Sand</HI> we find as curious Workman&s;hip, Proportions, Imbroideries, Parts and Figures, as you &s;ee in any of the greater Creatures. No Man alive can &s;ay how &s;mall a <HI>Du&s;t</HI> may be animated, and be a perfect living Creature. But then how incomprehen&s;ibly <HI>fine</HI> are the Parts and Proportions of that animated <HI>Mite?</HI> The Wing of a <HI>Moth</HI> is &s;een to contain as perfect and <HI>gay Feathers,</HI> as do the goodly Wings of the <HI>Peacock.</HI> This we &s;ee with our Eyes by the help of <HI>Gla&s;&s;es.</HI> The <HI>Grain</HI> of a common Chip of Wood, and more of a piece of Cork or Spunge, and more yet the <HI>Wing of a Fly,</HI> are all &s;uch delicate Embroideries as the Necks

<P>THUS the &s;malle&s;t <HI>In&s;ect</HI> is full of Wonders. The <HI>Greatne&s;s</HI> of the Creator is &s;een in the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> Things, as much as in the <HI>greater:</HI> but the <HI>Mini|mum quod &s;it</HI> can never be known by us.

<P>THUS are we a My&s;tery to our &s;elves, and find that within our &s;elves which we know not how to de&s;cribe: A <HI>Mind,</HI> a <HI>Will,</HI> a <HI>Con&s;cience, De&s;ires and Affections,</HI> which <HI>how</HI> they are, and how we received them, and how we exerci&s;e'em we know very imperfectly: but that we have 'em, and that we exerci&s;e 'em we are very &s;ure.

<P>THE Soul of Man is a mo&s;t wonderful thing; the <HI>Light</HI> is not brighter nor &s;wi&s;ter than its Mo|tion; it &s;urveys the vi&s;ible World in a Moment of Time, and forms Images of infinite invi&s;ible Things.

<P N="1">I. UNSEARCHABLE is the Greatne&s;s and Ma|je&s;ty of GOD in that Providence which he exer|ci&s;es over the <HI>highe&s;t and greate&s;t of his Works:</HI> whether <HI>Things, Creatures, Per&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Intelli|gencies.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. THE greate&s;t <HI>Things.</HI> By which I mean the vi&s;ible <HI>Orbs</HI> and <HI>Globes;</HI> the va&s;t <HI>planetary Bodies,</HI> whereof our Earth is one. What a <HI>migh|ty Being</HI> is HE, who has a&s;&s;ign'd to <HI>the&s;e</HI> their <HI>Di&s;tances, Places, Motions, Center, Magneti&s;m,</HI> and they inviolably obey the <HI>Law</HI> he gave them for Ever-more, in their exact <HI>Revolutions.</HI> If the great GOD did not govern <HI>the&s;e</HI> in our Favour, how &s;oon wou'd the Earth <HI>&s;ink</HI> under us, and the <HI>Pit open</HI> and &s;wallow us quick; or the Sea <HI>drown</HI> us! If the <HI>Sun</HI> &s;hould roll near to us it would &s;oon <HI>&s;corch</HI> us to Death; or if the <HI>Earth</HI> &s;hould roll further from it we &s;hould be as &s;oon <HI>frozen</HI> &s;tiff with Cold: if the <HI>Moon</HI> &s;hould leave us and
<PB N="58" REF="004489_0065_100D57D1419E8530">wander away, the <HI>&s;tagnated Sea</HI> would &s;oon <HI>poi&s;on</HI> us; or if it &s;hould roll on nearer to us 'twould rai&s;e the <HI>Tides</HI> &s;o high that they would run over our Hou&s;es. Now how great is that <HI>Providence</HI> which keeps the&s;e <HI>va&s;t Bodies</HI> in their Places, and makes 'em &s;o kindly mini&s;ter to one another thro' every Generation? So that <HI>Day</HI> and <HI>Night, Sum|mer</HI> and <HI>Winter; Tides, Dews</HI> and <HI>Rains</HI> do not fail us; but <HI>vital Heat and Moi&s;ture and Re&s;pira|tion</HI> is provided for and pre&s;erved unto us and all the living Creatures!</P>
<P>BUT to keep to our own <HI>Limits</HI> a little more,</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is the <HI>un&s;earchable Power</HI> of GOD that commands the <HI>Winds,</HI> and infinite is the <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> which orders that mild or wild <HI>Ele|ment</HI> the <HI>Air.</HI> How thin, and light, and &s;oft and yielding an Element in its <HI>Calm?</HI> how &s;trong, and fierce, and raging, &s;preading wide De&s;olations, when GOD bids it &s;torm? How much is the World govern'd by the Mini&s;trations thereof? GOD u&s;es it, rai&s;es and &s;tills it as he plea&s;e. <HI>His Way is in the Whirlwind, and in the Storm, and the Clouds are the Du&s;t of his Feet! His Fury is pour'd out like Fire, and the Rocks are thrown down by him.</HI> He <HI>gathers</HI> the Wind in his <HI>Hand,</HI> and when he lets them <HI>&s;ly,</HI> how do they <HI>roar and tear?</HI> Di|vine Maje&s;ty and Wrath rides upon its Wings; the Earth &s;hakes and the Hills move under its Force and Weight; <HI>A Smoke goes out of his No|&s;trils, and Fire out of his Mouth devours; Dark|ne&s;s is under his Feet, and at his Brightne&s;s the thick Cloud pa&s;&s;es, Hail-Stones and Coals of Fine.</HI> P&s;al. 18.10, 12.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="004489_0066_100D57D367D39A38">
THUS GOD looks to the Ends of the Earth, and &s;eeth under the whole Heavens, to make the Weight for the Winds, and to weigh the Wa|ters by Mea&s;ure; to give Decrees to the Rain, and to make a Way for the Lightning and Thun|der; he &s;ees it and declares it, he prepares it and &s;earches it out; which none be&s;ide him can do. He cau&s;eth it to come whether for Correction or Mercy. Now out of the <HI>South</HI> comes the <HI>Whirl|wind,</HI> and <HI>Cold</HI> out of the <HI>North,</HI> and <HI>Fro&s;t</HI> is the Breath of GOD: Pre&s;ently again he <HI>quieteth</HI> is the Earth by the &s;ame <HI>South Wind,</HI> and we know not how our <HI>Garments grow warm</HI> upon us. Now he <HI>per&s;ecutes</HI> a guilty World by his Tempe&s;ts, and makes them afraid by his Storm; again he merci|fully <HI>fanns</HI> and <HI>purges</HI> the Air for us, by bring|ing the Winds out of his <HI>Trea&s;ures,</HI> and the pleas'd <HI>Mariners</HI> improve the welcome <HI>Gale,</HI> the <HI>Ships</HI> &s;tagger under their Cour&s;es, and are driven with their rich <HI>Freight</HI> to their <HI>Port.</HI> Thus the Great|ne&s;s and Goodne&s;s of GOD is &s;een in the <HI>blowing</HI> of the Wind.</P>
<P N="2">2. No le&s;s is it in the <HI>Ruling and Ordering of the Sea:</HI> in commanding the <HI>Waters,</HI> the va&s;t <HI>Deep</HI> and <HI>Aby&s;s</HI> wherein our Earth &s;eems to <HI>float,</HI> and with which it is <HI>wa&s;h'd,</HI> by which it is al&s;o in a great Mea&s;ure <HI>&s;tock'd</HI> and <HI>enrich'd.</HI> The Crea|tures <HI>in</HI> it, and the Dwellers <HI>upon</HI> it, are beyond Number; and what a mighty Providence is it that watcheth over them all! There <HI>go the Ships,</HI> and there <HI>plays Leviathan!</HI> Let us look and <HI>dive</HI> a little into this <HI>wide and great Sea,</HI> wherein are Things creeping <HI>innumerable,</HI> both &s;mall and great Bea&s;ts, which do all wait upon GOD, as

Let them <HI>exalt</HI> him al&s;o in the <HI>Congregation</HI> of the People, and prai&s;e him in the <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> of the <HI>Elders.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is no &s;mall part of the divine Dominion, <HI>from Sea to Sea.</HI> His <HI>Way</HI> is in the Sea, &amp; his <HI>Paths</HI> in the great Waters, and his <HI>Foot&s;teps are not know,</HI> P&s;al. 77.19. He rules the <HI>raging</HI> of it, when the Waves ari&s;e he <HI>&s;tilleth</HI> them: O who is
<PB N="61" REF="004489_0068_100D57D815C2A5F0">a <HI>&s;trong</HI> LORD like unto him, or to his <HI>Faithful|ne&s;s</HI> round about him! <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 89.8, 9. The <HI>Floods</HI> may lift up their <HI>Voice</HI> and their Waves, but the LORD on high is mightier than the <HI>Noi&s;e</HI> of many Waters, yea than the <HI>mighty Waves</HI> of the Sea.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>dry Land,</HI> our <HI>habitable Earth,</HI> is un|der a mo&s;t wonderful, wi&s;e, gracious and power|ful Pre&s;ervation and Government. How is it <HI>&s;tock'd</HI> with Creatures, and not a Species lo&s;t! How is it <HI>cloath'd</HI> with <HI>Gra&s;s,</HI> and cover'd with <HI>Corn,</HI> and water'd with <HI>Springs</HI> and <HI>Rivers,</HI> which run in the <HI>Valleys,</HI> yea a&s;cend up into the <HI>Hills!</HI> What a rich <HI>yearly Provi&s;ion</HI> is made for the li|ving Creatures, and in them for us? What rich and va&s;t Stores of <HI>Vapours</HI> are daily a&s;cendings, and by Night de&s;cending in <HI>Dews</HI> on us? Why does not the Earth <HI>&s;ink</HI> in the va&s;t Aby&s;s, how does it <HI>&s;wim</HI> &s;o <HI>even</HI> in it, and &s;o <HI>&s;afely</HI> in the &s;tormy Day? Or rather what Power <HI>re&s;trains</HI> the foaming Waters in its &s;pacious <HI>Womb?</HI> What &s;aves us from de&s;olating <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> and who is it that now and then creates that <HI>new</HI> and rare <HI>thing;</HI> when the Earth opens its Mouth and &s;wal|lows up <HI>Cities;</HI> Multitudes go down together quick and <HI>alive into the Pit. "He removeth the Mountains at his Plea&s;ure, and they know it not, he overturneth them in his Anger; he &s;haketh the Earth our her Place, and the Pillars thereof tremble,</HI> Job 9.5, 6. But the <HI>ordinary Cour&s;e</HI> of his Providence is <HI>gracicus</HI> and bountiful, a <HI>tender Car:</HI> and Mercy to us: "<HI>By his Strongth he &s;et|teth fa&s;t the Mountains, being girded with Power; be makes the Morning and Evening to rejoice; he

<P>AND thus I have in the <HI>Phra&s;e of Scripture</HI> meditated the divine <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> re&s;pecting the greater Parts of the <HI>Creation;</HI> the <HI>Orbs</HI> and <HI>Globes</HI> we &s;ee in <HI>our</HI> World, and parti|cularly our own <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Earth</HI> and <HI>Sea.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. UNSEARCHABLE is the Work of Provi|dence <HI>in the Supply and Government of the living Creatures in all the&s;e:</HI> which are mighty <HI>Ho&s;ts</HI> for number, of every <HI>Kind;</HI> yet GOD <HI>feeds</HI> them all, lays in a daily Provi&s;ion for them, and by <HI>In&s;tinct</HI> guides them to provide for them&s;elves, both as to <HI>Defence</HI> and <HI>Su&s;tenance.</HI> He giveth to the <HI>Bea&s;t</HI> his Food, and to the <HI>Ravens</HI> which cry to him: the young <HI>Lions</HI> &s;eek their Meat of him while they roar after the Prey: and the Shoals of <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> in the Sea, both the <HI>&s;mall and great</HI> there, wait on him to <HI>gather</HI> what he <HI>&s;catters</HI> among them with a full Hand.</P>
<P>NEITHER is there any Creature &s;o <HI>va&s;t</HI> but GOD rules it; none &s;o &s;trong as to be Ma&s;terle&s;s. Tho' the <HI>Bones of Behemoth</HI> be as pieces of <HI>Bra&s;s,</HI> and as Bars of <HI>Iron</HI> (one of the Chief of the Works of GOD) yet he that made him, can make his <HI>Sword</HI> to enter into him: tho' the huge Creature drinketh up a <HI>River,</HI> and tru&s;teth that he can draw up <HI>Jordan</HI> into his Mouth; yet Providence

<P>ALMIGHTY Providence ea&s;ily commands the dumb Creature, and they <HI>forget</HI> their In&s;tinct, and go <HI>again&s;t their Nature.</HI> Voracious <HI>Ravens</HI> are made to feed <HI>Elijah</HI> at one time, and <HI>Angels</HI> them|&s;elves do it at another.

The hungry <HI>Lions</HI> &s;how reverence to his <HI>Prophet,</HI> while they <HI>pant</HI> for the Blood of his Enemies. The <HI>Lion</HI> &s;lew the <HI>di&s;obedient Prophet</HI> at GOD's Word, but to &s;hew that it was meerly and <HI>Act of Obedience,</HI> and not of his &s;avage Nature, he &s;tood by the <HI>Carca&s;e</HI> and by the <HI>A&s;s</HI> &amp; touched neither of 'em any more:

<P>To name no more: When the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> weary of the <HI>Ark</HI> had put it in a <HI>New Cart,</HI> and their <HI>Sin-offering</HI> with it, to be drawn by two <HI>Milch-kine</HI> that had never before been <HI>yok'd,</HI> put|ting all the <HI>late Di&s;pen&s;ations</HI> of Providence to|ward them upon this I&s;&s;ue: 1 Sam. 6.9. <HI>If it goeth up by the Way of its own Cour&s;e,</HI> (i e. in the <HI>Road</HI> and &s;treight <HI>Highway</HI> toward the Land of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> a Road that the Creatures had never gone, nor indeed had they ever drawn at all in a Yoke) <HI>then hath the GOD of I&s;rael done us this great Evil; but if not, then &s;hall we know that it was not his Hand that &s;mote us, but it was a Chance that hapned to us.</HI> Providence <HI>agreed</HI> and join'd <HI>I&s;&s;ue</HI> on the <HI>Event,</HI> and both the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;aw the Glory of JEHOVAH, the only true and living GOD. For immediately the <HI>Kine</HI> took the &s;treight Way to <HI>Beth&s;heme&s;h,</HI> the next Bor|der of <HI>I&s;rael, lowing</HI> as they went, (<HI>&s;cil.</HI> after their <HI>Calves</HI> which they left behind, yet con|&s;trained to go on by an invi&s;ible Power againft the &s;trong <HI>Inclinations</HI> of Nature) they turn'd

<P>NOW what an un&s;earchable Government is this over the living Creatures and <HI>brute Animals,</HI> be&s;ides their u&s;ual abundant Services to Man. But to pa&s;s from the <HI>greater Things and Creatures;</HI> unto <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Intelligences</HI> created.</P>
<P N="3">3. UNSEARCHABLE is the Providence of GOD in its Government of <HI>intelligent and rational Crea|tures:</HI> whether in Heaven, Earth or Hell; An|gels, Men and Devils.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the <HI>boly Angels</HI> and their <HI>high Orders,</HI> we know by Revelation that they are a <HI>noble Part</HI> of GOD's Dominion. We read of their ready Obedience, Subjection and Mini&s;trations. "<HI>They excel in Strength, and do his Command|ments, hearkning unto the Voice of his Word: Are they not mini&s;tring Spirits, &s;ent forth?</HI> And do they not gladly <HI>come,</HI> pleas'd in the lowe&s;t Ser|vices to Men? They humbly own them&s;elves the <HI>Fellow-Servants</HI> of Prophets and holy Saints. They wor&s;hip and adore GOD the CREATOR, and the <HI>Lamb</HI> our SAVIOUR with more Aba&s;e|ment, as well as Fervour and Delight, than we on Earth can attain unto. They <HI>cover their Faces,</HI> tho' &s;o bright, and cry&mdash;<HI>Holy, Holy, Holy, LORD GOD of Ho&s;ts! the whole Earth is full of thy Glory.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="004489_0073_100D57E25AF86758">
AT the &s;ame time the&s;e <HI>Thrones</HI> and <HI>Dominions</HI> in the Heavens are &s;uch <HI>high and potent Beings,</HI> that the Empire over a few of the&s;e we may think more glorious to the CREATOR, than the Subjec|tion of all the Nations of the Earth.

<P N="2">2. <HI>DEVILS</HI> that fell from Heaven, yet have not made their <HI>E&s;cape</HI> from the divine Dominion and Government.

<P>INDEED <HI>evil Spirits</HI> have a <HI>Range</HI> permitted to them, and are <HI>us'd</HI> too by Providence in <HI>judi|cial Executions,</HI> as in <HI>Ahab</HI>'s Seduction, and <HI>Judas</HI> his tragical End. But they are under <HI>Re&s;traints,</HI> and <HI>Fru&s;trations;</HI> are limited, and over-rul'd to good, as well as wicked Men. The Devil could

<P N="1">1.

<P>PROVIDENCE <HI>re&s;trains</HI> the proud Powers on Earth, and takes its time to <HI>puni&s;h</HI> them.

<P>WHEREFORE:</P>
<P N="2">II. THE Greatne&s;s and Maje&s;ty of GOD is un|&s;earchable in that Providence which he exerci&s;es over the <HI>lea&s;t and lowe&s;t of his Creatures.</HI> For it is mo&s;t certain that the pre&s;erving and govern|ing Providence of GOD extends to the <HI>meane&s;t and mo&s;t minute Things</HI> which he has made: Nor can this look <HI>little</HI> in the <HI>&s;upream Maje&s;ty</HI> of Hea|ven, but it is his <HI>true and infinite Greatne&s;s.</HI> It is not like the contemptible <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Childi&s;h|ne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Roman Emperor,</HI> who was trifling and <HI>catching Flies</HI> when he &s;hould have been at the <HI>Council-Board,</HI> bearing and directing the weighty Affairs of the <HI>Empire.</HI> GOD <HI>neglects none</HI> of his Creatures, and lea&s;t of all do the <HI>greater Affairs</HI> of the World e&s;cape him. His <HI>general and com|mon Care</HI> is to the <HI>lea&s;t,</HI> a more <HI>&s;pecial Providence</HI> is over the <HI>greate&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THE narrow Mind of <HI>Man</HI> can attend but to a <HI>few</HI> Things at a time, and therefore they had need always be the <HI>greater</HI> and <HI>weightier:</HI> but the infinite <HI>GOD</HI> with the &s;ame Ea&s;e governs and cares for a <HI>Million</HI> of Creatures as <HI>One;</HI> and <HI>ten

<P>"Do you &s;ee thou&s;ands of <HI>little Motes and Atoms</HI> wandring up and down in a <HI>Sun-Beam?</HI> (&s;ays Bi&s;hop <HI>Hopkins</HI>) it is GOD that &s;o peoples it: He <HI>guides</HI> their in numerable and irregular Stray|ings: Not a <HI>Du&s;t</HI> flies in the beaten Road, but its uncertain Motion is guided, and the <HI>Storm</HI> &s;hall not carry it further than its appointed Place.</P>
<P>OUR SAVIOUR tells us that the <HI>Hairs of our Head are numbred,</HI> and that tho' <HI>two Sparrows</HI> be but the Price of a <HI>Farthing, yet not one of them falls to the Ground without our Father in Heaven,</HI> Matth. 10.29, 30.

<P N="1">1. The Worth of <HI>pardoning Mercy: Adoption</HI> in Chri&s;t, <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> thro' him, and <HI>Reconcilia|tion</HI> to God.

O what does the great GOD work <HI>in</HI> and <HI>for</HI> the Souls of his <HI>Cho&s;en in Chri&s;t!</HI> A Work marvellous and glorious as Man's fir&s;t Creation in the Image of God! For in this new Creation there al&s;o is commanded <HI>Light</HI> out of Darkne&s;s, <HI>Order</HI> and Beauty out of a <HI>Chaos</HI> of Confu&s;ion and Emptine&s;s.</P>

<P>UNSEARCHABLE are the <HI>Purpo&s;es</HI> of Mercy, and the evident <HI>Proofs</HI> thereof in the End, in ma|ny <HI>terrible Di&s;pen&s;ations</HI> of Providence to parti|cular <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Families.</HI> The greate&s;t out|ward <HI>Rebukes</HI> prove not &s;eldom the greate&s;t &s;piri|tual Mercies, and <HI>&s;ure&s;t Con&s;olations</HI> of their Lives.

<P N="3">3. UNSEARCHABLE is the Conduct of divine Grace in making the very <HI>Sins</HI> of Men, and their <HI>foul Falls</HI> into Sin, to be the <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> very often, and <HI>effectual Means</HI> of their Conver&s;ion and Sal|vation Happy the Sinner that is bro't to &s;ee the

They are <HI>frighted</HI> to &s;ee their own Faces, and <HI>a&s;ham'd</HI> to be &s;een of others. From loathing a <HI>particular Fact</HI> they come to the loath|ing all <HI>Manner of Sin,</HI> as &s;uch. <HI>I have &s;inned,</HI> &s;aid <HI>David,</HI> and into what a glorious Exerci&s;e of Repentance did it ca&s;t him? <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51. <HI>Peter</HI> by his Fall learn'd <HI>Humility</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI> and &s;o gain'd a future <HI>Stability.

3. UNSEARCHABLE is the HOLINESS and JU|STICE of GOD in the Work of our <HI>Redemption.</HI> The infinite <HI>Sanctity</HI> of GOD has more &s;hone forth in the Satisfaction for Sin in the Death of Chri&s;t, than even in the Severity of the Law con|demning and threatning it. Herein eminently is the <HI>LORD of He&s;ts exalted in Judgment, and GOD that is Holy is &s;anctified in Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> What <HI>Hatred</HI> of Sin, and <HI>Vengeance</HI> again&s;t it, appears in the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of the Son of GOD, and his &s;hedding his precious Blood? A <HI>Life</HI> worth more than the Blood of <HI>all Men,</HI> and the Life of <HI>Myriads of Angels</HI> added to them! Where does GOD appear &s;o <HI>glorious in Holine&s;s,</HI> &s;o irreconcile|able to Sin, and &s;o full of the Dete&s;tation of it, as in this <HI>Demand</HI> of his Ju&s;tice, and <HI>Oblation</HI> to it. That Holine&s;s <HI>might not</HI> &s;uffer, CHRIST did: ra|ther than <HI>&s;pare</HI> Sin GOD <HI>&s;pared not</HI> his own Son, and was inexorable to the <HI>&s;trong Crying and Tears</HI> of his everla&s;ting Love.</P>
<P>THE Glory of <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> together was the <HI>End</HI> of our Saviour's Death; the glorious De&s;ign &amp; <HI>Fruit</HI> of Redemption. HE, the <HI>HOLY ONE</HI> of GOD, &s;anctifies whom he &s;aves. The <HI>Faith</HI> in Him that ju&s;tifies us, <HI>purifies</HI> us al&s;o. The <HI>Elect</HI> are cho&s;en in Him unto Sanctification, and called to be <HI>Saints.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT will not GOD <HI>&s;acrifice</HI> to the Honour of his <HI>Holine&s;s!</HI> What <HI>Myriads</HI> of apo&s;tate An|gels! What <HI>Worlds</HI> of impenitent Sinners! What are <HI>the&s;e</HI> compared with the Offering of his <HI>own Son?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="004489_0122_100D5849DA23ECD0">
I need not add:</P>
<P N="4">4. THAT the divine GRACE and MERCY are Un&s;earchable in the Work of Redemption. The Height and Depth of the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD herein ex|pre&s;&s;ed <HI>pa&s;&s;eth Knowledge.</HI> It is his <HI>great Love wherewith he loved us:</HI> to the <HI>Prai&s;e of the Glory of his Grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved.</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>GOODNESS</HI> was the <HI>Spring</HI> of our Redemp|tion: the <HI>Motive</HI> to it was <HI>meer Love:</HI> the <HI>Bene|fits</HI> thereof are an infinite <HI>Variety</HI> of eternal Mer|cy. It was <HI>free Grace</HI> again&s;t De&s;ert: the <HI>Riches</HI> of Grace to &s;upply our infinite Wants: <HI>Di&s;tin|gui&s;hing</HI> Mercy that regarded us when it pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Angels.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is but a very tran&s;ient and general <HI>View</HI> of the <HI>un&s;earchable Glories</HI> of the <HI>divine Perfections,</HI> &s;hining forth in the Work of Redemption. Let us <HI>pau&s;e</HI> here and recollect, what un&s;peakable Things GOD has done for it! What ine&s;timable Trea&s;ures he has expended on it! What un|&s;earchable Things he has provided in CHRIST for poor Sinners! What has he not given <HI>for</HI> us, what has he not given <HI>to</HI> us! It &s;urmounts all Tho't, &s;urpa&s;&s;es all Conception and Admiration! We can never in any equal or fitting Manner adore, prai&s;e, extol the Mercies and <HI>Benignity</HI> of our gracious GOD toward us Cou'd we Think with all the Swi&s;tne&s;s and Inten&s;ene&s;s of Angels, and &s;peak with their Tongues, and &s;hould we &s;pend our whole Life here and Eternity hereafter, in looking into and magnifying the divine Wi&s;dom, Power, Holine&s;s and Mercy in our Redemption, yet at la&s;t it were <HI>ineffable.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="004489_0123_100D584C5B9B2768">
LET us <HI>reflect</HI> on what hath been &s;aid, &amp; <HI>infer:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE incomprehen&s;ible Glory of our SAVIOUR.</HI> His Glory is <HI>great</HI> in our Salvation; <HI>Honour and Maje&s;ty</HI> does it put upon him: it declares him <HI>mo&s;t Ble&s;&s;ed</HI> for ever: His Name &s;hall continue <HI>as the Sun;</HI> and Men &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed <HI>in him;</HI> all Na|tions &s;hall <HI>call him Ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> His Dignity and Ex|cellency, Merits and Benefits fill the whole Earth with his Glory.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Reproach of the</HI> CROSS <HI>cea&s;eth.</HI> A Glory dwells upon it: The <HI>King of Glory</HI> hung upon it. No more let it be called the <HI>cur&s;ed Tree,</HI> but the <HI>Tree of Life;</HI> like <HI>that</HI> in the mid&s;t of the <HI>Paradice of GOD,</HI> yielding <HI>all manner</HI> of rich and precious <HI>Fruit.</HI> With what <HI>Garlands</HI> and <HI>Tro|phies</HI> is the <HI>triumphant Standard</HI> hung? Yea, with <HI>Crowns of Glory</HI> for them that are not a&s;hamed of his <HI>Reproach!</HI> Worthy to be e&s;teemed <HI>greater Riches</HI> than the <HI>Trea&s;ures</HI> of the <HI>Indies!</HI></P>
<P>BUT when I &s;peak of the CROSS you know how to take me right, of the <HI>meritorious Sacrifice</HI> of|fered thereon, by our <HI>Saviour,</HI> and the <HI>mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Effects</HI> of that Offering. Men may magnify the <HI>material Cro&s;s</HI> to gro&s;s <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and abu&s;e the <HI>Sign</HI> of it to <HI>Super&s;tition;</HI> but the Virtues of a <HI>crucified Saviour,</HI> the Merits and Power of his <HI>Death,</HI> can't be too much honoured by us.</P>
<P N="3">3. FROM all the incomprehen&s;ible Things al|ready &s;poken of we may well infer, <HI>What is not an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t worth?</HI> A <HI>Relation</HI> to him, a <HI>Fortion</HI> in him, a <HI>Name</HI> among his <HI>redeemed!</HI> O
<PB N="117" REF="004489_0124_100D584FD111E368">un&s;earchable Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s! O immen&s;e Felicity! How little do Men con&s;ider what is offer'd to 'em daily in the <HI>Tenders</HI> of Salvation! How <HI>great</HI> are the Things which we hear &s;o carelefly of, which we &s;o ea&s;ily neglect, and &s;et &s;o light by? <HI>O if thou knewe&s;t the Gift of GOD!</HI> GOD forgive us our <HI>Madne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Frenzy,</HI> for <HI>we know not what we do.</HI> That when the Offers of Salvation by CHRIST are daily made to us, and we are pray'd in his Name to accept of the great Redemption thro' him, yet we de&s;pi&s;e it as if it were the mo&s;t mi|nute, contemptible, de&s;picable Thing! The mean|e&s;t <HI>Tra&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dung</HI> in our Way! Whereas <HI>all Things</HI> &s;hould be &s;o to us for the <HI>Excellency</HI> here|of!</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>SEE the Guilt and Sin of Unbelief and Im|penitence under the Go&s;pel.</HI> What a high Indigni|ty and Provocation is it to redeeming Mercy! A mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing <HI>Ba&s;ene&s;s</HI> as well as Madne&s;s! That when the <HI>immen&s;e Grace</HI> of GOD is revealed to us, it &s;hould be but as a <HI>Pearl</HI> ca&s;t before <HI>Swine,</HI> who are ready to <HI>crucify afre&s;h,</HI> to <HI>turn</HI> again and <HI>rend</HI> the Son of GOD. <Q>Our Slight of a <HI>Saviour</HI> is (as Dr. <HI>Bates</HI> expre&s;&s;es it) a Sin of that tran|&s;cendent Height, that all the Abominations of <HI>Sodom</HI> are not equal to it. It exa&s;perates <HI>Mercy</HI> it &s;elf, that dear and tender <HI>Attribute,</HI> the on|ly Advocate in GOD's Bo&s;om for us. It is to &s;trike at the Heart, and kick at the Bowels of a <HI>Saviour.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="5">5. LET what we have heard <HI>beget in us the highe&s;t Confidence and Tru&s;t in Chri&s;t as an al&s;uffi|cient Saviour.</HI> He is able to <HI>&s;upply</HI> all our Needs,
<PB N="118" REF="004489_0125_100D5851580EB100">and to do for us beyond all that we can <HI>ask</HI> or <HI>think.</HI> Nothing is too great for him to do; no|thing can be wanting in him. There are no Bounds to be &s;et, how far he can pardon &amp; &s;ave; <Q>He is able to &s;ave unto the uttermo&s;t all that come unto GOD by him.</Q></P>
<P N="6">6, And la&s;tly, LET us <HI>learn Humility and Mo|de&s;ly in our Re&s;earches into the deep Things of GOD,</HI> and let us <HI>believe</HI> and <HI>adore</HI> where GOD has <HI>re|vealed</HI> tho&s;e Things which we cannot now <HI>com|prehend. GOD is Un&s;earchable,</HI>&mdash;therefore we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the <HI>Revelation</HI> which he makes of Him&s;elf. Our Rea&s;on is by no Means the Mea|&s;ure of Truth. <Q>No Man hath &s;een GOD at any time; the Only-Begotten of the Father he hath revealed him. The Glory of GOD is now to be &s;een in the Face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He that hath &s;een Him hath &s;een the Father.</Q> <HI>Our Faith mu&s;t &s;tand in the Wi&s;dom of GOD,</HI> and his plain Declarations concerning <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> who is <HI>Truth,</HI> and who is <HI>Incomprehen&s;ible,</HI> by a Nece&s;&s;ity of Nature.</P>
<P><Q>Now to the only-wi&s;e GOD our SAVIOUR, be Glory, and Maje&s;ty, Dominion and Power, both now and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>WORTHY is the LAMB that was &s;lain to receive Power, and Riches, and Wi&s;dom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Ble&s;&s;ing.</Q></P>
