<HEAD>The EPISTLE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Decay of Family Piety is an awful Symptom of the Dying State of Reli|gion among a People: And if ever GOD &s;hews Mercy to a Degenerate Land, He will pour out His Spirit upon Families, and thereby give a Glorious Re&s;urrection to Religion in them.</P>
<P>THAT there is a Scandalous Negli|gence in this Day of Apo&s;tacy, in all the vi|tal Parts of that Service, which GOD re|quires of Heads of Families with their Hou&s;es, is too notorious to be Denyed,
<PB N="ii" REF="001854_0004_0FB91CC0C2F76258">and too reproachful to Chri&s;tianity, not to be Lamented, with the mo&s;t &s;orrow|ful Re&s;entments of Soul, by all, that have the Glory of CHRIST, and the Pro&s;pe|rity of Souls at Heart.</P>
<P>THIS flows not from Mens Ignorance of their Duty; but from their re&s;olved ob&s;tinacy, and willfull Incon&s;ideration, which hinders them from a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their many Obligations hereto.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed &s;ome, who call them&s;elves <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> who pretend they &s;ee no Warrant or Obligation to <HI>Family-Prayer,</HI> which is a Principal part of that Service, we owe to GOD with our Hou|&s;es: They therefore Demand an Expre&s;s Precept for Divine Wor&s;hip in their Fa|milies: And with this they hope to ju&s;tify their Criminal Neglect of this Duty. But a&s;&s;uredly whatever trifling Pleas any may make to &s;ilence the Cla|mours of Con&s;cience; yet few or none
<PB N="iii" REF="001854_0005_0FB91CC196B5D7C0">in their cool and &s;erious Thoughts, can think them &s;ufficient to acquit them from Guilt at the Bar of <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> much le&s;s at the Tribunal of CHRIST.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, &s;ince there are &s;uch, as &s;eem to doubt of their Obligations to this E&s;&s;ential Part of Family-Religion; I &s;hall Offer a few Hints, which may Awa|ken and A&s;&s;i&s;t their Powers of Thought and Reflection to a &s;ight of the Equity and Rea&s;onablene&s;s, the Expediency and Nece&s;&s;ity of Family Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>HERE it may be Ob&s;erved that the Obligation to this Duty, is Originally Founded in the Law and Light of <HI>Na|ture;</HI> and not on Po&s;itive <HI>In&s;titution:</HI> And by Con&s;equence, the le&s;s need to require an Expre&s;s Direction for it in <HI>Revelation.</HI> Yet we are not without plain Intimations of it in Scripture Ex|amples and Precepts.</P>

AGREEABLE hereto we find Solemn Acts of Wor&s;hip attended in <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fa|mily; In <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Hou&s;e: for where|ever we find him Pitching his Tent, there we &s;ee him <HI>Erecting an Altar</HI> of Wor&s;hip: And there appear Evident Indications that this was <HI>Job</HI>'s, <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI>'s, and <HI>David</HI>'s Practi&s;e. And mo&s;t proba|bly, this was intended in <HI>Cornelius</HI>'s Cha|racter; Act. 10.2. <HI>He feared GOD,</HI> i. e. Wor&s;hipped Him <HI>with all his Hou&s;e.</HI> In many Places of the New-Te&s;tament we have this Duty pointed at. We are Commanded to <HI>Pray with all Prayer,</HI> Eph. 6 18. Which certainly includes Family-Prayer. And when the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> had lay'd down the Duties of the &s;everal Members of a Family, he then Exhorts them <HI>as One to continue in Prayer,</HI> Col. 4.2. And <HI>to Pray together.</HI> ver&s;e 3. as that Place might be more ju&s;tly ren|dred. This &s;ort of Prayer the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> &s;eems to have his Eye upon, in that Admonition, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.7. But we need
<PB N="v" REF="001854_0007_0FB91CC6D859FE58">not in&s;i&s;t on the&s;e; &s;ince this is an Act of Natural Wor&s;hip, and not purely In|&s;tituted; and as &s;uch approves it &s;elf to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;on and Con&s;cience of Men.</P>
<P>HENCE, all Nations, who were &s;o ju&s;t as to acknowledge a <HI>GOD</HI> and a <HI>Pro|vidence,</HI> have con&s;pired in the Practi&s;e hereof. The Heathen under the Con|duct of the Light of Nature Erected their <HI>Family-Altars,</HI> and Offered Daily Sacri|fices in their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>AND if the Foundation of Divine Wor&s;hip in General be con&s;idered, it will &s;trongly Enforce the Practi&s;e of Family-Devotion. The Fundamental Rea&s;ons of Divine Wor&s;hip flow from the Nature of GOD, and that &s;tate of ab&s;olute Depen|dance, and nece&s;&s;ary Subjection that Man &s;tands in to &s;uch a Glorious Being. The Relation that rea&s;onable Creatures &s;tand in to the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD, a Being of Infinite Excellency and Perfection, as He is their
<PB N="vi" REF="001854_0008_0FB91CC856785990">Creator, Pre&s;erver and Benefactor, their Owner, Lord and Lawgiver; does Infer an immutable Obligation to pay this Divine Homage and Wor&s;hip. Now will not our Obligations, for the &s;ame Rea|&s;ons, be as &s;trong to pay GOD the Tri|bute of <HI>Family-Wor&s;hip?</HI> Sure we are, That GOD is the Founder, Father, Be|nefactor, and Owner of <HI>Families:</HI> By His Care and Providence our Hou&s;es are Built, our Families Sub&s;i&s;t, Grow and Flouri&s;h. What then more ju&s;t and rea|&s;onable than to Wor&s;hip Him as the GOD of our Families, and the Fountain of all their Ble&s;&s;ings? And by Solemn Joynt-Prayer in our Hou&s;es religiou&s;ly to ac|knowledge His Propriety in, and Domi|nion over us and our Hou&s;es; and our Dependance on and Subjection to Him. This certainly is one way to give GOD the Honour due to His Name. Family Prayer is on this account GOD's Right; and to with-hold it will be found Gro&s;s Inju&s;tice, and Black Ingratitude.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="001854_0009_0FB91CCA9B296E20">
IT is acknowledged by all, that the more Publick the Honour we pay to GOD, the greater it is: Now <HI>Family-Wor&s;hip</HI> is more Honourable to GOD on this account, than <HI>Solitary:</HI> And &s;ince we are bound to Wor&s;hip GOD in the be&s;t manner we can, we mu&s;t conclude our Family-Sacrifices mu&s;t not be with|held.</P>
<P>AGAIN, The Nece&s;&s;ity and Rea&s;ona|blene&s;s of Family-Prayer will be Evident if we Con&s;ider, That this Religious Practi&s;e has a nece&s;&s;ary and direct Ten|dency to promote all other Holy, and Religious Intentions in a Family. Here|by Heads of Families them&s;elves are awed to a greater Circum&s;pection and Care in their walk before their Hou&s;es: And it has a ble&s;&s;ed Tendency to beget and cheri&s;h an awful Sen&s;e of GOD in the Hearts of the whole Family; and to Awaken them to a ju&s;t concern for their Souls: This tends to give Life and Force to all the Solemn Coun&s;els, In&s;tructions
<PB N="viii" REF="001854_0010_0FB91CCEACE40120">and Admonitions given by Parents and Ma&s;ters in the Name of GOD to tho&s;e under their Charge. And in the&s;e re&s;pects Family-Wor&s;hip mu&s;t be accounted what is Good, and what the Lord requires of us.</P>
<P>IN a Word, I can't &s;ee what ju&s;t claim a Family, as &s;uch a Society, has to the Character of a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> or <HI>Religious</HI> Fa|mily, if <HI>Family-Prayer</HI> and Wor&s;hip be wholly neglected.</P>
<P>IF after all, any will indulge them&s;elves in the neglect of this Duty; and plea&s;e them&s;elves that they are not under Ob|ligation hereto: I would take Liberty to Leave Two or Three Enquiries with them to be re&s;olved.</P>
<P>DO you really believe GOD is as well plea&s;ed with, and as much honoured by your Omi&s;&s;ion of Family-Prayer, as He would be by a Religious Performance of it?</P>
<P>DO you apprehend that you have done all in your power for the Good of the Souls of your Family; while you neglect to Pray with them?</P>

DARE you advi&s;e your Children, when they come to &s;ettle in Hou&s;es of their own, to follow your Example, and live in the Neg|lect of Prayer in their Families?</P>
<P>IN a Word, Are you willing that Death &s;hould overtake you, while you live in the Omi&s;&s;ion of this part of Wor&s;hip? Can you &s;ay, upon mature Deliberation, that you expect as much Peace and Com|fort in a Dying Hour, from a Reflection on the <HI>Neglect,</HI> as on the Con&s;cientious <HI>Di&s;charge</HI> hereof? Let Con&s;cience An|&s;wer: and be Ob&s;equious to it's Voice. And then I doubt not this Neglected Duty would be Revived; and Family-Sacrifices daily offer'd to GOD, <HI>i. e.</HI> Morning and Evening: Thus was the daily Sacrifice under the Law offer'd Morning and Evening. And if daily Per|&s;onal Wants and Mercies do Challenge daily Supplications and Thank&s;givings from particular Per&s;ons: by a Parity of Rea&s;on, The Wants and Mercies of a
<PB N="x" REF="001854_0012_0FB91CD1567F2F90">Family, which are daily and continual, do require daily Addre&s;&s;es from them in Con&s;ort. And nothing can be more Come|ly and Beautiful, nor more agreeable to the Ends of &s;uch a Duty, than for all the Members of a Family to Unite with one Mouth and Heart to <HI>&s;hew forth the Lov|ing Kindne&s;s of the LORD in the Morning: however that he, we Evening.</HI></P>
<P>AND nothing can be more Worthy the Thought and Care of CHRIST's Mini|&s;ters, who are called to Watch for Souls, and mu&s;t give an Account of them, than with great Frequency, and all po&s;&s;ible Importunity, to Inculcate this great Duty upon their Charge.</P>
<P>NOW this Principal part of Family-Religion, together with all other Acts and In&s;tances thereof, is recommended to us in the following Solid, and Judicious Di&s;|cour&s;es: which are every way adapted to Revive the Power of Godline&s;s in our Hou&s;es.</P>

I de&s;ign not an Encomium on the Re|verend Author, or his Performances: His Mode&s;ty will not allow me to do him Ju&s;tice.

<P>And if it &s;eem Evil unto you to Serve the LORD, choo&s;e you this day whom you will Serve; whether the gods which your Fa|thers Served, that were on the other &s;ide of the Floud, or the god of the Amorites, in who&s;e Land ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">well: But as for Me and My Hou&s;e, we will Serve the LORD.</P></Q>

<P>THIS Book containeth in Hi&s;tory of the Seventeen Years of the Rule of <HI>Jo&s;hua.</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Lighfoot</HI> Vol. 1 P. 39.</NOTE></P>
<P>It's uncertain who was the Pen|man of this Part of Sacred Writ: Some Conjecture that <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> Wrote it him&s;elf: however that be, we
<PB N="2" REF="001854_0016_0FB91CDA5924BCB0">know it was Written of him, and is a very notable and entertaining Hi&s;tory of the wonderful Provi|dences of GOD towards His People, and their E|nemies, under his Admini&s;tration. It acquaints us how GOD brought the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> into the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> with an high hand, and an out|&s;tretched arm, dividing the Waters of <HI>Jordan,</HI> delivering into their hands the Kings of the <HI>Ca|naanites,</HI> their Lands, and Cities.</P>
<P><HI>JOSHUA</HI> was an eminent Type of CHRIST both in Name and Office. His Name be&s;peaks, him to be a <HI>Saviour,</HI> and is the &s;ame with <HI>Je&s;us</HI> only <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> retains the <HI>Hebrew; Je&s;us</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> termination. Agreeably He is call'd <HI>Je&s;us</HI> by the Seventy; and al&s;o in the New-Te&s;tament. And indeed JESUS is the True JOSHUA, the <HI>Saviour</HI> of GOD's <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> He is the <HI>Captain of our Salvation, and was given to be a Leader and Commander to the People,</HI> to Lead them to tho&s;e glorious Man&s;ions prepared for them in the <HI>Heavenly Canaan. Mo&s;es</HI> did not lead <HI>I&s;rael</HI> into <HI>Canaan;</HI> for the Law made nothing Perfect; but <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> did, and therein he was a Type of Chri&s;t, who hath His Name <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>He Saves His People from their Sins;</HI> Subdues their Enemies for them, and conducts them to their Everla&s;ting Re&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT to return, In this Chapter wherein is our Text, we have an account of &s;ome of the Excel|lent Things which <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> did ju&s;t before his Death. Great were the Pains which he took to E&s;tabli&s;h GOD's Ancient People in His true Faith and Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>FOR this End, (1) <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> a&s;&s;embled all the Tribes at <HI>Sichem.</HI> (2) He put them in mind of
<PB N="3" REF="001854_0017_0FB91CDBD859F2A0">the wonderful Favours which GOD had &s;hown to their Fathers, and them&s;elves. (3) He im|prov'd the Narrative which he had given of GOD's Wonderful and Miraculous Appearances for them, in a Word of Exhortation, and a &s;olemn Charge, to Fear and Serve the LORD. (4) He call'd upon them to determine, and choo&s;e whom they would Serve; and makes a &s;olemn Prote&s;tation for him&s;elf, and Family, that they would Serve the LORD. (5) He renew'd the Covenant of the LORD with the People, Wrote the&s;e Words in the Book of the Law, and &s;et up a great Stone as a Me|morial of this Covenant-Tran&s;action, and as a Witne&s;s of their Engagements to be the LORD's.</P>
<P>THE Words of our Text contain the Call which <HI>Jo&s;ua</HI> gives the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> to choo&s;e and determine whom they would Serve, and the re&s;o|lute Prote&s;tation which He makes for Him&s;elf, and Hou&s;hold, that they would Serve the LORD.</P>
<P>BEFORE I Name the DOCTRINE intended Principally to be in&s;i&s;ted on, I &s;hall mention &s;e|veral Doctrinal Ob&s;ervations from the&s;e Words, and as they &s;tand related to the Context.</P>
<P>Ob&s;er. I. <HI>THEY that would Serve the LORD; mu&s;t Renounce Obedience to Satan, the World, and their Lu&s;ts; and must Re&s;olve to be for GOD, and for no other.</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;er. II. <HI>IF we would Engage in the Service of GOD; We mu&s;t do it Deliberately, and of Choice.</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;er. III. <HI>THEY that would Fear, and Serve the LORD; they must do it in Sincerity, and in Truth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001854_0018_0FB91CDE17F3A720">
Ob&s;er. IV. <HI>ALTHOUGH the Genernlity of a Profe&s;&s;ing People &s;hould for&s;ake the LORD, and Serve other gods: Yet we &s;hould re&s;olutely Adhere to Him, and continue Stedfa&s;t in His Service.</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;er. I. <HI>THEY that would Serve the LORD; they mu&s;t Renounce Obedience to Satan, the World, and their Lu&s;ts: and mu&s;t Re&s;olve to be for GOD, and for no other.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Saviour hath A&s;&s;ur'd us, that <HI>No man can Serve Two Ma&s;ters:</HI> for either he will hate the One, and love the Other; or el&s;e he will hold to the One, and de&s;pi&s;e the Other, <HI>Ye cannot Serve GOD and Mammon,</HI> Mat. 6.24. We cannot Serve GOD and our Lu&s;ts; GOD, and this Sinful World: for they are Contrary, as Light and Darkne&s;s. The Truth of this doctrinal Propo&s;ition will ap|pear, as Written with a Sun-beam, if we con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>WE Wave but ONE Supream LORD, the Eternal GOD.</HI> Indeed, it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Nature of the Thing, and implys the greate&s;t Contradiction, that there &s;hould be Two Supream Infinite Beings e&s;&s;entially di&s;tinct. GOD is One: Deut. 6.4. <HI>Hear, O I&s;rael, The LORD our God is One LORD.</HI> He who is Omni&s;cient tells us, that He knows not any be&s;ides Him&s;elf, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 44.8.

Accordingly, the ble&s;&s;ed GOD can brook no Ri|val; He mu&s;t be Lov'd with <HI>all</HI> the Heart; and nothing el&s;e mu&s;t be lov'd at all, but in &s;ubor|dination
<PB N="5" REF="001854_0019_0FB91CE09397BB58">to Him. He mu&s;t be Obey'd without Limitation, and Served with all our Powers. And therefore if we would Serve the LORD; we mu&s;t deny Obedience to <HI>Satan,</HI> the <HI>World,</HI> and our <HI>Lu&s;ts;</HI> and by the Grace of God, bring every proud Thought and Imagination, into Sub|jection to His Will.

<P N="2"><HI>THE Laws whereby the ble&s;&s;ed GOD Governs His People, are directly contrary to the law of Sin, and the corrupt rules and maxims of a Sinful World.</HI> For the Law of GOD is holy; and the Command|ment holy, and ju&s;t, and good, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.12.

P&s;al. 95.6, 7. <HI>O come, let us wor&s;hip &amp; how down; let us kneel before the LORD our MAKER.

This is one thing implyed in <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI>'s Re&s;olution, that he would Wor&s;hip GOD in his Family by <HI>Prayer,</HI> and that they &s;hould offer up their united Reque&s;ts and Petitions at the Throne of Grace. The Scripture &s;peaks of <HI>David</HI>'s ble&s;&s;ing his Hou&s;hold, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 6.20. It is &s;aid, <HI>v.</HI> 18. <HI>He ble&s;&s;ed the People in the Name of the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</HI> And, v. 20. <HI>Then David returned to ble&s;s his Hou&s;hold.</HI> Men <HI>ble&s;s</HI> others, by <HI>Praying</HI> for GOD's Ble&s;&s;ing upon them. And thus, it is pro|bable, <HI>David</HI> ble&s;&s;ed his Family, by <HI>Praying</HI> with, and for them. In the Morning and Infancy of the Church, Families were Churches; &s;uch was <HI>Adam</HI>'s, &s;uch <HI>Noah</HI>'s. There are Family-Wants; and therefore Ma&s;ters of Families &s;hould together with their Hou&s;es, make known their Reque&s;ts to GOD, for the Supply of them: There are Fa|mily-Duties to be performed; and therefore they &s;hould join together with their Hou&s;es in Praying to GOD for Strength and Grace to do them Ac|ceptably, to Di&s;charge them to His Glory, and their own Comfort. They receive many Family-Mercies, and therefore it becomes them to join together in Ble&s;&s;ing and Prai&s;ing that GOD who is the Author of all our Mercies, <HI>the Father of Lights,
<PB N="32" REF="001854_0046_0FB91D11D63351B0">from whom cometh down every good and perfect giving.</HI> Furthermore, there are many Family-Sins, which &s;hould be Confe&s;s'd and Bewail'd; certainly then, it is the Duty of the Heads of Families to make known their Reque&s;ts unto GOD, <HI>by Prayer and Supplication, with Thank&s;giving.</HI> They mu&s;t attend upon this Du|ty Daily, engage in it with great Seriou&s;ne&s;s. They mu&s;t look to it, that tho&s;e who are under their Care and In&s;pection, give due Attendance at the Times for Prayer; and choo&s;e the mo&s;t Convenient Sea&s;ons for the Di&s;charge of this Duty. They &s;hould &s;tudy &s;o to order their Secular Affairs, that they may not interfere with, or crowd out this nece&s;&s;ary Duty, but that they may have due and &s;uitable Time for the Di&s;charge of it. Fervent Prayer is an Excellent Mean to keep true Piety Alive and Flouri&s;hing; and it is a con&s;iderable and e&s;&s;ential Part of that Homage which we owe to the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD. And therefore, if this Du|ty be neglected, we do not Serve the LORD with our Hou&s;es as we are bound to do.</P>
<P>(2.) <HI>THEY &s;hould Read the Scriptures with their Families.</HI> As we mu&s;t <HI>Speak</HI> to GOD and hum|bly call upon Him by Prayer, &s;o we &s;hould at|tentively <HI>Hear</HI> what GOD the LORD hath to &s;ay unto us. It's therefore very Proper to join with Prayer the Reading a Portion of the Word of GOD in the Family. This is a Part of Divine Wor&s;hip, and it ought to be a Part of our Daily Wor&s;hip in our Hou&s;es. We read, 2 Tim. 3.16. <HI>All Scripture is given by in&s;piration of GOD, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> We have in the&s;e Oracles of GOD the Rules laid down according to which we mu&s;t Walk, if we would

<P>TO the&s;e Particulars it might be added, That the <HI>Singing of P&s;alms</HI> is a Plea&s;ant and Profitable Exerci&s;e, which &s;hould be attended, where there's Ability to Perform it.</P>

Each Member of the Family come to years of Di&s;cretion, mu&s;t Wor&s;hip GOD apart, as well as in conjunction with the Family. Our Saviour commands, Mat. 6.6. <HI>But thou when thou praye&s;t, enter into thy clo&s;et, and when thou ha&s;t &s;hut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in &s;ecret,</HI> &mdash; It &s;hould be their care that &s;uch as are well-di&s;po&s;ed in their Families, may not have ju&s;t rea&s;on to complain that they are not allow'd time to Pray, and Read the Word of GOD in Secret. Our Servants are not &s;o <HI>ours,</HI> but they are the LORD's &s;till, and GOD expects that part of their time be daily devoted to His more immediate Service; &s;o that if we refu&s;e to grant convenient time for &s;uch Duties, we rob GOD of His due.</P>

<P>TO Conclude, Let us Pray to GOD to pour out His Spirit from on High, to revive Family-Religion which &s;eems to be under vi&s;ible Decays and Langui&s;hments.

Its the Will of GOD, That Ma&s;ters of Families &s;hould diligent|ly In&s;truct tho&s;e that are under their Care, in the <HI>Good Knowlege of the LORD.</HI> That they &s;hould teach them to fear the LORD, and command them to keep His Statutes and His Judgments. And that they &s;hould be careful to maintain the Wor|&s;hip of GOD in their Hou&s;es. Indeed its the duty of all and every one in their &s;everal Places, and according to their &s;everal Capacities, to &s;eek the advancement of true Piety in the Hou&s;es where they dwell. But then its peculiarly incum|bent on Heads of Families. GOD hath &s;et them over their Families for this end. GOD hath made them <HI>Over&s;eers</HI> to in&s;pect their Hou&s;es, and they <HI>mu&s;t watch over them as they that mu&s;t give account.</HI> GOD hath put you into this Relation, and it is with a Charge to improve it to His Glory, and Honour, and the Advancement of the Intere&s;ts of His Kingdom.

When you have Servants, The Voice of GOD's Providence to you is, Take the&s;e Servants, and endeavour to teach them the Service which the LORD their GOD requires of them, the My&s;tery of their General, as well as
<PB N="50" REF="001854_0064_0FB91D2FD702F208">of their Particular Calling. Show them the Bonds and Obligations which they are under to Serve the LORD; and endeavour that they may be delivered from the Slavery of Satan, the Bon|dage of their Lu&s;ts; and become the LORD's Freemen, the Faithful and Obedient Servants of our Common LORD and Ma&s;ter. This is the Voice of GOD's Providence, as well as of His Word. The Relation they &s;tand in to their Fa|milies, as it commands re&s;pect and Obedience from tho&s;e under their Government: &s;o it al&s;o lays them under peculiar Obligations to Honour GOD, by taking care that their Hou&s;es Serve Him.

<P N="2"><HI>IF Ma&s;ters take no care that their Hou&s;es may Serve the LORD; then the Iniquity of their Hou&s;es will be laid to their Charge; and they Them|&s;elves with their Families will be expo&s;ed to the Wrath and Cur&s;e of a Jealous GOD.</HI> We are guilty be|fore GOD, and become Partakers with others in their Sins, when we do not according to the Relation we &s;u&s;tain, and the Power and Influence we have, &s;eek to keep them from Iniquity, and do not bear a due Te&s;timony again&s;t their Sins. <HI>If our Children or Servants make them&s;elves vile, and we re&s;train them not;</HI> if we &s;uffer them to go on in their evil ways, without Warning, Reproof and needful Correction; we become guilty before GOD; the gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and defilement of their, abo|minations will cleave unto us.

For I have told him, that I will judge his Hou&s;e for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth: becau&s;e his Sons made them&s;elves vile, and he re&s;trained them not.

If we neglect to maintain the Wor&s;hip of GOD in our Hou&s;es, we rob Him of the Offerings of Prayer and Prai&s;e, which are His due. We rob Him of His Glory while we indulge abominable Iniquities in our Hou&s;es. Now this is the way to have the Cur&s;e of GOD &s;poken of in this Text, lie upon us, and upon ours. Such as live like Hea|then in their Hou&s;es, have rea&s;on to fear that
<PB N="52" REF="001854_0066_0FB91D32D6612810">Cur&s;e &s;hould fall upon them, P&s;al. 79.6. <HI>Pour out thy wrath upon the Heathen that have not know thee, and upon the Kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.</HI> Sometimes the Hou&s;es <HI>of the wicked are &s;afe from fear, neither is the rod of GOD upon them,</HI> Job 21.9. They are carnally &s;ecure, and pro&s;per upon Tem|poral Accounts. But then this is one of the mo&s;t dreadful Judgments, to be &s;uffered to go on in Sin without the Checks and Re&s;traints of GOD's Pro|vidence. Spiritual Plagues are the wor&s;t of Plagues. Certainly then the Ma&s;ters of Families are oblig'd to u&s;e their endeavours that their Hou&s;es may Serve the LORD, as they would hope to pre&s;erve them from the bla&s;ting Cur&s;e of a Jealous GOD. And then if Ma&s;ters are neg|ligent in their Duty, and do not bear Te&s;timony again&s;t Sin in their Families; they will pull down an heavy load of Guilt on them&s;elves, and day them&s;elves open to the Righteous Di&s;plea&s;ure and Fiery Indignation of GOD. If our Children or Servants peri&s;h through our Criminal negli|gence; if we take no care for their In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s; their Blood will be required at our Hands. And if we die without Repentance they will ri&s;e up in Judgment again&s;t us, in the Great and Terrible Day of the LORD, when we and they mu&s;t &s;tand before the Judgment Seat of CHRIST to give an account of the things done in the body, and to receive our final Sentence. And O how terrible will it be to have our Children accu&s;e us then, and &s;ay, You were cruel to our Immortal Souls, and never had any true regard to our Spiritual Welfare: You were more care|ful to teach us the vain Fa&s;hions, and evil Cu&s;toms of the World; Than to in&s;truct us in the Principles of Religion, and to u&s;e your endeavours that we
<PB N="53" REF="001854_0067_0FB91D3457AF1858">might be brought to the Saving knowledge of GOD in CHRIST: You were more Solicitous to have us adorned with tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which might recommend us to the e&s;teem of the World; Than to have us adorned with the Graces of the Spirit, and with the Beauties and Glories of the inward Man; you allowed us to Serve divers Lu&s;ts and Plea&s;ures; but never call'd upon us Seriou&s;ly, to Serve the LORD our Maker.

When He comes into our Hearts, or into our Hou&s;es to dwell with us: He will not come empty-handed; No, But He will bring Spiritual and Heavenly Ble&s;&s;ings with Him; The Ble&s;&s;ings of the Upper and the Nether Springs. If we and our Hou&s;es Serve the LORD, then will GOD Ble&s;s us, Delight in us, and Rejoyce over us to do us good. Prov. 3.33. <HI>The Cur&s;e of the LORD is in the hou&s;e of the wicked: but he ble&s;&s;eth the habitation of the ju&s;t.</HI> Now its the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD that Buildeth the Hou&s;e, that E&s;tabli&s;heth it, that Enricheth it.

<P N="5"><HI>THIS is the be&s;t way you can take to keep up and maintain your Authority in your Families.</HI> Thus to Honour GOD by Serving Him in your Fami|lies, is the be&s;t way to &s;ecure to your &s;elves Re|&s;pect and Obedience. If your Children and Servants &s;ee that you improve your Power for GOD; this will probably beget in them reverence and e&s;teem. If Ma&s;ters of Families are careful to Command their Hou&s;hold to fear the LORD, and keep His Commandments; This will give Force and Authority to tho&s;e Commands which more immediately re|&s;pect them&s;elves: For the Law of GOD doth re|quire Children to obey their Parents; Servants, their Ma&s;ters. The Word of GOD &s;trongly en|forceth Relative Duties as a Vital and E&s;&s;ential Part of pure Religion. And therefore the more we promote true Religion in our Hou&s;es; the more this flouri&s;heth and grows: By &s;o much the more will Heads of Families he likely to Maintain their Authority, and to receive tho&s;e acknowledgements, that Duty &amp; Obedience in their Hou&s;es, which is owing to them. Their Piety will give them an Ornament of Grace, a Crown of Glory. There's a Maje&s;ty in
<PB N="58" REF="001854_0072_0FB91D3D66EEDBA0">true Piety which commands Re&s;pect. But if Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es are Vicious and Profane them&s;elves, and take no care to promote the Service of GOD in their Families; they may expect to be lightly e&s;teemed. If they do thus di&s;honour GOD, He may be provok'd to <HI>pour Contempt</HI> upon them, and to lay their honour in the du&s;t. 1 Sam. 2.30 &mdash; <HI>Them that honour Me, I will honour; and they that de&s;pi&s;e Me &s;hall be lightly e&s;teemed.</HI> How often hath the Authority and Government of Heads of Families been forfeited and lo&s;t by not being improv'd for the Glory and Honour of GOD? And that Threatning hath been fulfilled. I&s;ai. 24.2. <HI>And it &s;hall be &mdash; as with the Servant, &s;o with his Ma&s;ter; as with the Maid, &s;o with her Mistre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><HI>TO promote Religion and the Service of GOD in our Families, will be most Comfortable and Advanta|gious for Us and Ours.</HI> Heads of Families can't take a better cour&s;e to promote the true&s;t welfare of their Hou&s;es, than by taking Care to Serve the LORD in them. This will be both plea&s;ant and profitable: For the more there is of Religion in the Family, the more comfort we &s;hall be likely to have in our &s;everal Relations. The Word of GOD teacheth us how to di&s;charge the Duties of our &s;everal Relations; and that's nece&s;&s;ary in order to our Enjoying true Comfort in them.</P>
<P>THE more there is of true Religion in a Family, The more there will be of true Comfort and de|light in the <HI>Conjugal Relation.</HI> If Husbands and Wives <HI>walk in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Law blamele&s;s,</HI> there will be a Mutual love and endearment between them; and the Commands of GOD re&s;pecting their Mutual Duties will not be grievous; but ea&s;y, plea&s;ant, and delightful, as far as the Grace of GOD governs them. The more
<PB N="59" REF="001854_0073_0FB91D3F9793DF98">they <HI>dwell as heirs together of the Grace of Life;</HI> the more true Satisfaction will they enjoy: This will &s;weeten to them the Troubles they meet with, and make their burthens lighter, while each one doth his part, and bears his part, <HI>forbearing one another in love,</HI> in Obedience to GOD's Command|ments.</P>
<P>AGAIN, The more careful Heads of Families are to Serve the LORD with their Hou&s;es, The more Comfort they will be likely to have in their <HI>Children.</HI> If we teach our Children the good know|ledge of the LORD, and u&s;e our utmo&s;t endeavours that they may be made <HI>Wi&s;e to Salvation;</HI> then we may hope to have joy in them in this Life, and that which is to come. <HI>A wi&s;e Son maketh a glad Father,</HI> Prov. 15.20. The Love of Parents to their Children is a very Con&s;tant, and a very &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ion. How greatly then mu&s;t they rejoyce (if they under&s;tand their own intere&s;t, and the intere&s;t of their Children) <HI>To &s;ee their Children walking in the Truth.</HI> What a Satisfaction mu&s;t it be to them to behold the Image of GOD &s;hining in their Chil|dren! And how great Ble&s;&s;ings and Comforts will &s;uch Children be to their Parents! The more they fear GOD, and keep His Commandments; the more dutiful, the more helpful will they be; the more will they be the Staff and Solace of their Age. On the other hand, <HI>A fooli&s;h Son</HI> (and wickedne&s;s is the wor&s;t Folly) <HI>is a grief to his Father, and bit|terne&s;s to her that bare him,</HI> Prov. 17 25. The more your Children love GOD, the more they obey His Commands; the more will they love one another, the clo&s;er will their Union be, which is their &s;trength and glory. How plea&s;ant is it both for Parents and Children, when they dwell together in Unity: P&s;al. 133.1, 2. <HI>Behold, how good and how plea&s;ant it is, for
<PB N="60" REF="001854_0074_0FB91D4116810068">Brethren to dwell together in Unity. It's like the precious oyntment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aarons beard, that went down to the &s;kirts of his garments.</HI> Like a &s;weet perfume, it will afford delight, and chear the Spirits. Great E&s;tates and. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions will not make your Children happy; No, No, If they have not the &s;aving knowledge of GOD in CHRIST; If they do not choo&s;e GOD for their Portion: their Worldly enjoyments will be fuel for their Lu&s;ts; They will prove Snares and Temptations to them, e&s;trange them from GOD, and &s;o &s;et them at a greater di&s;tance from true Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; and plunge them into the deeper aby&s;s of Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>AGAIN, The more Careful they are in this kind, the more likely will Ma&s;ters of Families be to enjoy Comfort in <HI>their Servants.</HI> If our Servants become the Faithful Servants of GOD; they will then be Faithful and Diligent in Serving <HI>us.</HI> If Servants Fear the <HI>LORD,</HI> they will be Obedient to their <HI>Ma&s;ters; Not with Eye-&s;ervice as Men-plea|&s;ers, but as the Servants of Chri&s;t, doing the will of GOD from the Heart.</HI> Were Ma&s;ters more careful to Teach their Servants to know the LORD, as well as to under&s;tand their Particular Trade; they would probably, not have &s;o much rea&s;on to com|plain of Unfaithful di&s;obedient Servants, as now they have. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> writing to <HI>Philemon</HI> concerning his Servant <HI>One&s;imus,</HI> whom he had be|gotten in his bonds, &s;ays, Philemon 10, 11. ver&s;es. <HI>I be&s;eech thee for my Son One&s;imus whom I have begotten in my bonds: which in time pa&s;t was to thee unprofita|ble; but now profitable to thee, and to me.</HI></P>
<P>AND as Religion will be comfortable and bene|ficial to the Heads of Families, and their Hou&s;es, In that it obligeth every One to the Duty of their
<PB N="61" REF="001854_0075_0FB91D429646CA10">re&s;pective Relations, and &s;o tends to keep Peace in the Family, and to make the Members of it mu|tual Ble&s;&s;ings each to other <HI>while they live together:</HI> So al&s;o it wou'd afford &s;trong con&s;olation to Ma&s;ters <HI>when the Relation between them and their Families, or any parts of them, &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved.</HI> We are Chil|dren of Change, and many are the Changes which pa&s;s over us in this pa&s;&s;ing World. And in a little time Death will break the Bands whereby we are united, and Di&s;&s;olve the Relations be|tween Husbands and their Wives; Parents and their Children; Ma&s;ters and their Servants. Now in hours of &s;uch Changes, it will be very Com|fortable, if we can look back, and &s;ay, While we Lived together we took care to Serve the LORD together. This will be Comfortable to us, when our Children or Servants do remove from us, and become the Heads of di&s;tinct Families: This will be Comfortable to us, when our Chil|dren or Servants &s;hall be taken from us by Death. It is no new and uncommon thing for Parents that live to Old Age, to &s;urvive their Children. And they have the Sorrow many times of Bury|ing Children that are grown up. Now it will afford them Light and Comfort in &s;uch a dark Hour, if they can &s;ay that they Devoted &s;uch Children unto GOD; That they Pray'd for them, and Pray'd with them; that they Educated them for GOD. This will be a Comfort to them when GOD calls for His Children which were given, or rather lent unto them. This will al&s;o be Com|fortable to us when <HI>our own time to Die</HI> &s;hall Ap|proach; when the Hour &s;hall draw nigh, in which we mu&s;t be carried out of our Hou&s;es, to the &s;ilent Grave. O how Comfortable will it be, if, when the Voice of GOD's Providence &s;ays to us, as
<PB N="62" REF="001854_0076_0FB91D451F35A790">2 King. 20.1. <HI>Set thine hou&s;e in order, for thou &s;halt die, and not live.</HI> I &s;ay, If then we can Appeal to GOD as <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> v. 3. <HI>I be&s;eech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy &s;ight.</HI> This will &s;trengthen our Hearts when we come to bid an Eternal Farewel to our Hou&s;es; and the Places which now know us, &s;hall know us no more. If we Serve GOD with our Hou&s;es in Sincerity, then we may in a Dy|ing Hour Ble&s;s them in the Name of the LORD, with a well grounded hope that the Eternal JEHOVAH will continue to Dwell in our Fa|milies, and delight to Ble&s;s them, when we are gathered to our Fathers. Then we may commit our near Relations unto GOD with an humble Confidence that He who is the EVERLASTING FATHER, will be <HI>the Father of our Fatherle&s;s Chil|dren; the Husband of our Widows.</HI> Then we may leave our Children with GOD, hoping in Him that <HI>He will take them up,</HI> and take a Fatherly Care of them, when we are Dead and gone. If we can &s;ay, While we were with them in the World, we us'd our endeavours to keep them in the Fear and Service of GOD: we may then Pray in Faith that GOD would pre&s;erve them from <HI>the Evils,</HI> when we are not. In a Word, Thus to Serve GOD with our Hou&s;es, will be very Comfortable to us at the Great Day, when our Judge &s;hall Demand of us, What have you done with, What have you done for your Chil|dren and Servants which I gave you? O what Divine Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction will it be, if we &s;o Serve GOD here with our Hou&s;es, that we may come to Rejoyce together in the Day of CHRIST's Appearing. What a joyous Crown of
<PB N="63" REF="001854_0077_0FB91D465638E378">Glory will our Children be to us, if we &s;hall be able in that Day to &s;ay, <HI>Lo here we are, and the Children Thou ha&s;t given us!</HI> But whatever the Event be; yet if we by the Grace of GOD, do our Duty in Sincerity, we &s;hall give up our Account with Joy.</P>
<P>TO Conclude, Let us con&s;ider the many Obli|gations we are under, to Serve the LORD with our Hou&s;es; how much it is both our Intere&s;t and Duty &s;o to do. And then, re&s;olve by the Help of GOD, That <HI>as for us and our Hou&s;es, we will Serve the Lord.</HI> Let us con&s;ider Seriou&s;ly, that the Care and Charge of Families, is in a peculi|ar manner committed to the Heads of them. O let us not then dare to Betray this Tru&s;t! Wo to us if we do. Let us awfully con&s;ider, that if we take no Care to Serve the LORD with our Hou&s;es, the Iniquity of our Hou&s;es will be laid to our Charge (as we have heard) and we, to|gether with them, &s;hall be expos'd to the Wrath and Cur&s;e of GOD. O that this Con&s;ideration might awaken us to Serve the Lord with <HI>Reverence and Godly Fear,</HI> in our Hou&s;es. O that we might be effectually per&s;waded by the Terrors of the LORD, to Serve GOD our &s;elves, and to call up|on our Children and Servants to join with us in this Excellent Service; to Warn and to Reprove them for their Sins, and u&s;e our Endeavours to Reclaim them, that &s;o their Blood may not be re|quired at our Hands, in the Great Day of Ac|count. Let us Remember, that this is the way to engage the Pre&s;ence of GOD with us, and to obtain His Ble&s;&s;ing. And let Love to our &s;elves, and our Children, quicken us in this way to &s;eek after the Pre&s;ence and Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, without
<PB N="64" REF="001854_0078_0FB91D4A165529C0">which our outward Enjoyments will be turned into Cur&s;es. Have we any regular Self-Love? Have we any true Affection to our Families? Have we any Bowels of Compa&s;&s;ion Yearning to|wards our Children, which are our &s;elves multi|plied? O then, let us &s;how and manife&s;t our Love, by u&s;ing our utmo&s;t Endeavours to &s;ecure the Pre&s;ence and Ble&s;&s;ing of God, with our &s;elves; with our Wives, who are our &s;elves; with our Children; with our Servants. This will be the be&s;t and mo&s;t evident Te&s;timony of our hearty Love to them.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Let us con&s;ider how Comfortable and Profitable it will be for us, and our Hou&s;es to Serve the LORD. And let us now &s;eek after Comfort in our &s;everal Relations in this way. It may be we have been Extravagant in our Expectations, too ready to promi&s;e our &s;elves great Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction other ways, and upon other Accounts; but have been Di&s;appointed (as Men generally are, when their Expectations from the Creature are Carnal and Sen&s;ual) and have found little el&s;e but Vanity, and Vexation of Spirit. Let us then Reflect on our Folly, and Repent of it. And now let us &s;eek for Comfort, by Serving GOD our &s;elves, and by taking care to Engage our Relations to join with us in Serving the LORD. In this we &s;hall find &s;olid Plea&s;ure, durable Sa|tisfaction. If we join together Heartily in Ser|ving the LORD; we &s;hall then have real Joy in our Relations, &s;uch Joy as Death it &s;elf &s;hall not be able to Bereave us of. And now, <HI>O that we were Wi&s;e, and under&s;tood this;</HI> that we could con|&s;ider where our true Intere&s;t lies, and the Intere&s;t of our Families; that it might be well with us and ours for Ever.</P>

Cer|tainly then Heads of Families are &s;trongly oblig'd to teach their Children and Servants GOD's Sta|tutes and His Judgments, and to Call upon them earne&s;tly to Serve the LORD. This is the way to have our Children made the Ble&s;&s;ings and Or|naments of the Places where they dwell; and have them &s;tand up for GOD, and maintain His Wor&s;hip when we are dead and laid in our Graves. Whereas if Family-In&s;truction be neglected, if Fa|mily-Di&s;cipline be not kept up, and that with a peculiar regard to the advancement of true Piety, and for the di&s;countenancing of Vice: We &s;hall have dreadful rea&s;on to fear that there will ari&s;e a Generation not knowing the LORD, and refu|&s;ing to Obey His Commandments. Undoubtedly then, Heads of Families are under Indi&s;pen&s;ible Obligations to In&s;truct their Children, and Com|mand them to Serve the LORD. For in this way they will do excellent Service to the Publick, and lend a helping hand towards the building of GOD's Temple among us. If we would hope to have our Churches grow and encrea&s;e with the Increa&s;ings of GOD; we mu&s;t keep up Family Religion, that &s;o our Hou&s;es may be Nur&s;eries of true Piety, wherein our Young Ones may grow up, thrive and flouri&s;h; and as they grow in Stature, increa&s;e in true Wi&s;dom and Knowledge; that they may when grown up to Maturity; be as Trees of Righteou&s;ne&s;s Planted <HI>in the Courts of our GOD,</HI> that bring forth their fruit in due Sea&s;on. And indeed, Heads of Families are in a peculiar manner oblig'd to this Duty from the Privileges which they and their Children are admitted to in the Churches of CHRIST. Our Children are
<PB N="67" REF="001854_0081_0FB91D50D65E68F0">generally Bapti&s;ed. Now when Parents do enter into Covenant with GOD, and when they offer their Children to GOD in Bapti&s;m, they bring them|&s;elves under engagements to bring up their Children <HI>in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD;</HI> to Edu|cate them for that GOD who&s;e Name is call'd upon them, and to whom they are devoted when they receive this initiating Seal of the Covenant. When therefore we neglect this Duty, we are guilty of lying to the LORD, and are Perjured in His Covenant. O that we were awaken'd to con&s;ider the Vows of the LORD which are upon us, more Seriou&s;ly, more Solemnly! It is to be feared, It is much to be feared, that many who &s;eek this Privilege for their Children, looking upon it as an honorary Badge, which it is di&s;graceful to want: I &s;ay that many forget the peculiar bonds and obligations they are under to Serve the LORD them&s;elves, and to take care that their Children be con&s;ecrated to His Service. And then, unle&s;s Heads of Families take care that &s;uch as are under their Government be In&s;tructed; the Publick Di&s;pen&s;ations of the Word and Ordinances will be likely to be lo&s;t upon them. If they are not taught the Principles and fir&s;t Rudiments of the Chri&s;tian Religion, nor acquainted with the Im|portant Truths and My&s;teries of it, it can't be expected that the Word Preached &s;hould profit them. For want of this, &s;ays One, <Q>When we &s;peak never &s;o plainly of the things pertaining to the kingdom of GOD, to the mo&s;t we do but &s;peak Parables.</Q> Unle&s;s our Children and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ervants be Catechi&s;ed at Home, the plaine&s;t Truths almo&s;t delivered from the Pulpit, will be dark &s;ayings to them.

This is a poor Excu&s;e: What, are you &s;o Cumbred about many things, as to neglect the One thing needful. Will this turn to your Account in the Day of the LORD? Is this to Con&s;ult the true Intere&s;t of your Hou&s;es? No, no, you and yours &s;tand in m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> need of the Favour and Gracious Pre&s;ence of GOD, than of your Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d and Rai|ment. And then, it may be your Poverty is a ju&s;t Judgment of GOD upon you, for your Rob|bing Him of the Offerings of Prayer and Prai&s;e; and for refu&s;ing to Serve Him in your Families. Cry to GOD then for His Grace; Set up the Wor|&s;hip of GOD in your Families; and you will find that Time &s;pent in His Service, is Redeemed Time. For this is the way, as you have heard, to obtain His Ble&s;&s;ing on your Outward Affairs. Do not &s;ay, your Family Bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;o great, that you have not time for Family Duties. This Plea will not Profit you in the Day of Wrath. <HI>For what is a man pro|fited if he &s;hall gain the whole World, and lo&s;e his own Soul?</HI> Mat. 16.26.</P>
<P>DO not &s;ay, you have not Ability to engage in the Duties of Family-Wor&s;hip; particularly, to Pray with your Families: And &s;o ca&s;t off Family Religion. But rather Cry importunately to GOD to teach you to Pray, and to help your Infirmities. Study the Holy Scriptures, and your own Hearts; Meditate on your manifold Sins <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Con&s;ider your

And know it, GOD doth not look at the Elegancy and Neatne&s;s of your Expre&s;&s;ions in Pray|er; but at the Frame and Temper of your Hearts. Do not therefore live in the neglect of this Duty, becau&s;e you cannot Di&s;charge it &s;o well as might be de&s;ired. Engage in it in Obedience to GOD; look to Him for Strength, and He will a&s;&s;i&s;t you. Be now per&s;waded to give up your &s;elves to the LORD, and then take Care to maintain the Wor|&s;hip of GOD in your Families; and to u&s;e your Endeavours that your Hou&s;es may Serve the LORD.

<P N="1"><HI>HAVE an Eye to this in your fir&s;t Settlement, and begin to Serve the LORD with your Hou&s;e, as &s;oon as the Providence of GOD makes you the Head of a Fa|mily.</HI> Let it be your Care and Endeavour to &s;eek &s;uch to dwell with you, as will heartily joyn with you in Serving the LORD; and will counte|nance True Religion in your Family. And when you are Settled in a Family, Let your fir&s;t and chief Care be to Sanctify your Hou&s;e, and Con|&s;ecrate it to be a Temple for the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD to dwell in; to be an Hou&s;e of Prayer, where|in He &s;hall be Wor&s;hipped. Don't plead, that you are Afraid or A&s;hamed to be Prie&s;t to your Family in this regard, and to lead in the Wor&s;hip of GOD: But break through the Di&s;couragements which lye in your way, with Chri&s;tian Courage and Re&s;olution. Delays in this Matter are very Dangerous. The longer we neglect to Serve the LORD in our Hou&s;es, the more will our Temp|tations to live without GOD in our Hou&s;es, grow and prevail upon us.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>LET us Watch against every Thing that would hinder us from Serving the LORD with our Hou&s;es.</HI> Guard again&s;t Contentions and Divi&s;ions; and &s;ee that you Prudently follow the Things which make for Peace. It can't be expected, that a Family &s;hould be united in Serving the LORD, while the Hou&s;e is Divided again&s;t it &s;elf. Take care then to improve your Influence and Authority to keep
<PB N="77" REF="001854_0091_0FB91D65D69CA2A0">Peace in your Hou&s;es; and beware of doing any Thing to Sow the Seeds of Di&s;cord and Contention.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Shun Wicked and Profane Company. If you choo&s;e the Open Enemies of GOD and Re|ligion, for your Companions; If Per&s;ons of Pro|fane Lives, and Di&s;&s;olute Manners frequent your Hou&s;es with Freedom: This will put a Damp up|on Family-Religion; and you and your Hou&s;es will be in eminent Danger of learning their ways. If therefore you would Serve the LORD with your Hou&s;es, you mu&s;t &s;ay with him, P&s;al. 6.8. <HI>Depart from me all ye workers of Iniquity.</HI> On the other Hand, You mu&s;t &s;eek the Fellow&s;hip and Acquaintance of &s;uch as Serve the LORD with their Hou&s;es, and will be ready to Encourage, Strengthen and Confirm you in this Excellent Service.

And that, among other Things, for this very End, that they might &s;trengthen each other in Family-Piety, by their Amicable Union, and by their Communion in Offices of Kindne&s;s and Love.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>ENDEAVOUR &s;o to Order your Secular Affairs, that they may not interfere with, or crowd out the Wor&s;hip and Service of GOD.</HI> Every Thing is Beautiful in it's Sea&s;on; and that Bu&s;ine&s;s which is done <HI>Sea|&s;onably,</HI> is mo&s;t likely to be <HI>well</HI> done. There is a Time when it's our Duty to be Wor&s;hipping GOD in Secret: There is a Time when it is our Duty to be Wor&s;hipping GOD in our Families: There is al&s;o a Time when it's our Duty to be Diligently Employ'd in our Particular Callings.

<P N="4"><HI>STUDY to make the Exerci&s;es of Religion as Ea&s;y, Plea&s;ant and Profitable as you can.</HI> Endeavour to draw your Children and Servants to joyn with you in Serving the LORD, by <HI>the Cords of a Man, and the Bands of Love.</HI> Countenance and Cheri&s;h what you &s;ee of Good in them; and let them &s;ee that you are <HI>Plea&s;ed,</HI> when they endeavour to <HI>Plea&s;e</HI> and Serve the LORD.

Let your Family-Prayers be rather Fervent and Frequent, than very Long. Thus Endeavour to make your Religious Exerci&s;es as Ea&s;y, Plea&s;ant and Profita|ble as you can. It is true, GOD alone can give Per&s;ons a Spiritual Reli&s;h for Divine Things; However, we mu&s;t employ our Care and Diligence, not to Prejudice them again&s;t the Ways of Godli|ne&s;s.

Unle&s;s GOD pour out His Spi|rit upon them, they will continue <HI>in the Gall of Bit|terne&s;s, and Bond of Iniquity;</HI> for all what you are able to do. <HI>Abraham,</HI> who is Celebrated in Scrip|ture for his Care, to Command his Hou&s;hold to keep GOD's Statutes, had a Mocking <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> in his Family. <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> a Profane <HI>E&s;au; David,</HI> the Man af|ter GOD's own Heart, a Wicked <HI>Ab&s;alom.</HI> See then that you not only Pray <HI>with</HI> your Families; but al&s;o that you Pray to GOD in Secret <HI>for</HI> them; That GOD would make every One a Living Tem|ple for Him to dwell in; that He would pour His Spirit on your Seed, and His Ble&s;&s;ing on your Off|&s;pring. You can't teach Men the Saving Knowlege of the My&s;teries of Godline&s;s, as you may teach them your Particular Calling. The Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD's Common Providence is &s;ufficient for the latter; but the Influence of His E&s;pecial Grace is nece&s;&s;ary to Effect the former. Take Care then to Wre&s;tle with GOD in Secret Prayer as <HI>Jacob</HI> did, when he and his Hou&s;hold were greatly Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, for Fear of his Brother <HI>E&s;au.</HI> Then you may hope to Prevail with GOD to Command a Ble&s;&s;ing on your Diligent En|deavours to Serve the LORD with your Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>THUS we have in an imperfect manner, Con|&s;idered &s;ome of the Duties which Ma&s;ters of Fami|lies mu&s;t Carefully attend unto, if they would Serve the LORD with their Hou&s;es: As al&s;o &s;ome of the Obligations which they are under to Di&s;charge the&s;e Duties; And have made &s;ome brief Applica|tion. What Remains now, but that we Cry to GOD for His Holy Spirit, to make a Saving and Powerful Application of the&s;e Truths to our Souls; to put the&s;e Laws and Commands in our Inward Parts, and to Write them in our Hearts: That we
<PB N="80" REF="001854_0094_0FB91D6C97B64060">may be the <HI>Epi&s;tle of Chri&s;t, written not with Ink, but by the Spirit of the Living GOD.</HI> And that this Word of GOD may be in our Hearts, as Seed &s;own in good Ground, bringing forth Fruit to Life Eternal. Let us now each of us be prevailed with to give up our &s;elves to the LORD, to Obey and Serve Him for Ever. And the LORD grant, that Heads of Families may be per&s;waded Seriou&s;ly to Con&s;ider how much they are Obliged to Maintain and Pro|mote the Service of GOD in their Hou&s;es! O that all were brought to Sub&s;cribe to <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI>'s Re&s;olution and Engagement, and to &s;ay, one and another of us, <HI>As for me and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the LORD.</HI> If we be only the Hearers of the Word, it will be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>of Death unto Death,</HI> and Aggravate our Con|demnation in the Day of Judgment.

For if we walk before GOD with a perfect Heart, and Serve Him Faithfully in our Hou&s;es: Then GOD will dwell with us here; and we &s;hall dwell with Him for ever.
