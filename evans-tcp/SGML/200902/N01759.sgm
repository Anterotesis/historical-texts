<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q>There are Sinful Cour&s;es, which directly tend to bring per&s;ons to mi&s;erable, pinching poverty.</Q>
<P>There are <HI>degrees</HI> of <HI>Poverty.</HI> Some are <HI>poor negatively,</HI> that is, they are not rich, have not &s;uch <HI>plenty</HI> and <HI>abundance,</HI> as &s;ome of their Neighbours have. Yet po&s;&s;ibly by God's Ble&s;&s;ing on their prudent diligent Labours, they want neither <HI>Food</HI> nor <HI>Raiment</HI> convenient for them.</P>
<P>Again, Others are <HI>very poor,</HI> are not able to provide them&s;elves a <HI>comfortable
<PB N="4" REF="002083_0006_0FBB8A7DC5EEFF48">Dwelling,</HI> nor <HI>comfortable Food or Rai|ment;</HI> but as to what they can do them&s;elves, they're in <HI>pinching flraits, wants, nece&s;&s;ities.</HI> 'Tis this &s;ort of <HI>Po|verty,</HI> that &s;eems to be &s;pecially intend|ed in our Text. This Poverty is very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and too often puts per&s;ons on wicked practices. <HI>Prov.</HI> 30.9. <HI>Le&s;t I be poor and &s;teal, and take the Name of my God in vain</HI></P>
<P>Again, We may con&s;ider, <HI>This Po|verty is not a Sin, but a mi&s;ery.</HI> In its &s;elf con&s;ider'd, <HI>'tis no Sin to be poor.</HI> Though the <HI>Foxes had holes, and the Birds of the air had ne&s;ts,</HI> yet our Holy Redeemer <HI>had not where to lay his head.</HI> Mat. 8.20. <HI>Tho' he was rich, yet for your &s;akes he became poor.</HI> 2 Cor. 8.9. So the <HI>precious Saints</HI> of God, of whom the world is not worthy; are &s;ome|times <HI>poor in this world,</HI> tho' rich in faith. <HI>Jam.</HI> 2.5. They're &s;ometimes <HI>de&s;titute, afflicted, tormented,</HI> (Heb. 11.37.) <HI>naked, and de&s;titute of daily food.</HI> Jam. 2.15. We read of the <HI>poor Saints at</HI> Jeru&s;alem; and of the <HI>nece&s;&s;i|ty of the Saints.</HI> Rom. 12.13. and 15.26. Yea, it's po&s;&s;ible, per&s;ons may &s;ometimes come to <HI>pinching poverty;</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="002083_0007_0FBB8A7F6A6EDE88">yet not for any particular, remarkable Sin or fault of their own, that men know of. Con&s;ider <HI>Job</HI>'s poverty. It may be in many In&s;tances of Pover|ty, it may be &s;aid as of the man <HI>born blind.</HI> Joh. 9.3. <HI>Neither hath this man &s;inned, nor his Parents.</HI> That is, no particular, remarkable Sin beyond what all generally are guilty of, has brought the affliction. Their <HI>poverty</HI> may po&s;|&s;ibly be occa&s;ion'd, by &s;ome long <HI>ill|ne&s;s, weakne&s;s,</HI> or <HI>lamene&s;s</HI> of body; by <HI>Fire</HI> con&s;uming what they had; by <HI>Storms</HI> wa&s;ting their Sub&s;tance by <HI>Sea</HI> or <HI>Land;</HI> or by the <HI>failing</HI> or <HI>fal&s;ene&s;s</HI> of tho&s;e who had the main part of their E&s;tates in their hands; or their E|&s;tates may be taken away by <HI>Thieves, Robbers, Pyrates,</HI> open <HI>Enemies,</HI> or <HI>Per|&s;ecutors,</HI> who <HI>&s;poil them of their Goods.

<P>But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e things, yet very often vicious wicked practices, do evidently and directly bring <HI>pinch|ing Poverty</HI> on per&s;ons; and they well

<P>Q. <HI>What are tho&s;e &s;inful Cour&s;es, which directly tend to bring per&s;ons to mi&s;erable pinching Poverty?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I'll mention &s;ome.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sloth and Lazine&s;s.</HI> This is the <HI>Vice,</HI> which our Text more immedi|ately refers to. God hath made both our <HI>Bodies</HI> and <HI>Souls,</HI> we &s;hould glori|fie him with both, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.20. All our powers and abilities, &s;hould be imploy'd as God directs. God does not give us <HI>Talents,</HI> to be <HI>wrapt up in a Napkin,</HI> out to be imploy'd in his Service. Our <HI>Hands</HI> were not made, meerly to be folded up in <HI>Sleeping,</HI> but to be imploy'd in <HI>Work|ing. Adam</HI> while <HI>Innocent,</HI> was put into the <HI>Garden, to dre&s;s and keep it. Gen.</HI> 2.15. Note by the way, <HI>Inno|cence</HI> and <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> can't dwell toge|ther. If man would have his <HI>Bread,</HI> he mu&s;t then Work for it in the <HI>sweat of his Brows,</HI> and that as long as he lives, even <HI>till he returns to the Ground.</HI> Gen. 3.19 <HI>The Sun ari&s;eth,
<PB N="7" REF="002083_0009_0FBB8A85E07C2980">man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour until the evening.</HI> P&s;rl. 104.22, 23. The day then, is to be &s;pent in <HI>Labour,</HI> not in <HI>Lazine&s;s.</HI> How plain are tho&s;e words? <HI>Exod.</HI> 20.9. <HI>Six days &s;halt thou labour, and do all thy work.</HI> Surely then the <HI>&s;lothful</HI> Servant, is a <HI>wicked</HI> Servant. <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.26. <HI>Study to be quiet, and to do your own bu&s;ine&s;s, and to work with your hands as we commanded you, that ye may have lack of nothing.</HI> 1 The&s;. 4.11, 12. Here's a plain command of God, that per&s;ons &s;hould <HI>do their own bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> &s;hould <HI>work with their own hands,</HI> to &s;upply their <HI>own wants.</HI> 2 The&s;. 3.10. <HI>This we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither &s;hould he eat.</HI> Tho&s;e <HI>who</HI> are unwil|ling to work, are unworthy to eat. We &s;hould <HI>Work</HI> as well as <HI>Pray,</HI> for our <HI>daily bread;</HI> and &s;hould be, <HI>not &s;lothful in bu&s;ine&s;s, but fervent in &s;pi|rit, &s;erving the Lord.</HI> Rom. 12.11. Tho&s;e hone&s;t and diligent in lawful bu&s;ine&s;s, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, common|ly get a comfortable Support for them&s;elves &amp; theirs; &amp; are al&s;o able <HI>to give to him that needeth.</HI> Eph. 4.
<PB N="8" REF="002083_0010_0FBB8A89A0878B90">28. But Lazine&s;s, Idlene&s;s, does as it were directly, naturally, nece&s;&s;arily lead to Poverty. <HI>Prov.</HI> 10.4. <HI>He be|cometh poor, that dealeth with a &s;lack hand: but the diligent hand maketh rich.</HI> Prov. 20.13. <HI>Love not &s;leep, le&s;t thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou &s;halt be &s;atisfied with Bread.</HI> Prov. 23.21. <HI>Drow&s;ine&s;s &s;hall cloath a man with rags. By much &s;lothfulne&s;s, the building decayeth; and thro' Idle|ne&s;s of the hands, the hou&s;e droppeth throngh.</HI> Eccle&s;. 10.18. It's plain from the Word of God, from the light of rea&s;on, from the natural tendency of &s;econd cau&s;es, from experience and ob&s;ervation; that Sloth and Idle|ne&s;s tend to bring plaching poverty. Therefore it's very wicked, to be la|zy and idle; whether per&s;ons have <HI>E|&s;tates or not,</HI> they &s;hould be diligently imploy'd in &s;ome lawful bu&s;ine&s;s, tend|ing to promote the glory of God, and good of Mankind. None &s;hould in|dulge <HI>Idlene&s;s,</HI> neither <HI>Rich</HI> nor <HI>Poor, Young</HI> nor <HI>Old, Men</HI> nor <HI>Women,</HI> tho' 'tis not nece&s;&s;ary that all &s;hould be imploy'd in the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s. God will call all to to an account, how they
<PB N="9" REF="002083_0011_0FBB8A8A886E2848">imploy'd their <HI>time</HI> and <HI>abilities,</HI> whe|ther as he commanded them or not.</P>
<P>A Grave Author (<HI>Durham</HI> on the Commands, <HI>Octavo, p</HI> 341.) &s;ays,
<Q>When God giveth men ability of body on mind, it is &s;ad that they &s;hould be u&s;eful for nothing, nor active in any thing but to Sin, and be &s;nares and reproaches to Chri&s;tians, and Chri&s;ti|an Religion, as all idle per&s;ons, bear|ing the name of Chri&s;tians, are, who|ever they be, whether Gentlemen, or others.</Q></P>
<P>Idlene&s;s is call'd, <HI>Master omnium vi|tiorum et Noverca omnium virtutum;</HI> that is, the Mother of all Vices, and the Step-mother of all Vertues.</P>
<P>Indeed <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> is a breach of God's Law, it's contrary to the plain Pre|cepts of Chri&s;tianity, it di&s;honours the Chri&s;tian Religion, provokes God, gra|tifies the Devil, hurts men as to their Bodies and Souls, their Per&s;ons and Fa|milies; and &s;o hurts the Publick too on various accounts. Yet many in|dulge Idlene&s;s, they are &s;o <HI>lazy</HI> or <HI>proud,</HI> or both, that they won't work. <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Idlene&s;s,</HI> were two of the Sins of <HI>Sodom.</HI> Ezek. 16.49. Are there not many, &s;o <HI>poor,</HI> that they <HI>want nece&s;&s;a|ries;</HI> and yet won't &s;toop to do this
<PB N="10" REF="002083_0012_0FBB8A8BFB8532A8">or that <HI>inferior laborious &s;ort of work,</HI> no, they &s;corn it? Po&s;&s;ibly they'll <HI>Beg</HI> or <HI>Steal,</HI> rather than do it. If their <HI>Particular Trade</HI> fails, po&s;&s;ibly they'll think, they have a <HI>warrant</HI> to be <HI>Idle;</HI> and won't turn their hand to other bu&s;ine&s;s; or if they can't have their <HI>full price,</HI> they'll rather be Idle than work for <HI>mean Wages</HI> But their Pride and Sloth are abominable to God, and ought to be abhorr'd by men.</P>
<P>So, &s;ome are &s;o proud, fond and foo|li&s;h, that they <HI>won't let their Children go out to Service,</HI> to be us'd to bu&s;ine&s;s, earn their Living; no, they'll rather keep 'em at home, or playing in the Streets, training 'em up in <HI>Ignorance, Idlene&s;s, Hunger</HI> and <HI>Nakedne&s;s.</HI> Are there not too many In&s;tances of this? Some Parents are &s;o <HI>proud</HI> and <HI>fond,</HI> that they had rather their Children, <HI>Daughters</HI> e&s;pecially, &s;hould <HI>want ne|ce&s;&s;aries' at home;</HI> than <HI>go to Service,</HI> where they might <HI>learn more, be better.</HI> and <HI>live better</HI> on all accounts. Such <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Fondne&s;s</HI> are hateful in Pa|rents; and un&s;peakably hurtful to their Children. For this bringing up Chil|dren in <HI>Ignorance, Pride, Idlene&s;s,</HI> emi|nently fits them for the Devil's Ser|vice; it often leads to <HI>Lying, Stealing,
<PB N="11" REF="002083_0013_0FBB8A8DA2F46CE0">Fornication, Drunkenne&s;s,</HI> and various &s;orts of wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ince <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> is thus <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>pernicious,</HI> &s;urely <HI>diligence</HI> in law|ful bu&s;ine&s;s is a <HI>Vertue,</HI> and tho&s;e ex|emplary for it, are &s;o far prai&s;e-wor|thy. Prov. 22.29. <HI>See&s;t thou a man di|ligent in his bu&s;ine&s;s? He &s;hall &s;tand be|fore Kings, he &s;hall not &s;tand before mean men.</HI> So, tho&s;e are prai&s;e-worthy, who bring up their <HI>Children</HI> in the <HI>good knowledge of Religion,</HI> and <HI>diligently im|ploy'd in proper bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> For <HI>Children &s;hould be train'd up in the way, wherein they &s;hould go,</HI> Prov. 22.6. If you would not have them live like lazy, u&s;ele&s;s Drones when grown up; then don't Educate them &s;o, while they are young.</P>
<P>'Twould al&s;o be prai&s;e-worthy, to &s;tudy, contrive, and promote &s;ome me|thods for <HI>Imploying the poor,</HI> even <HI>Men, Women,</HI> and <HI>Children;</HI> that if they want bu&s;ine&s;s, they may be &s;et on work, and may <HI>eat their own bread.</HI> 2 The&s;. 3.12. It's a better Service to God and men, to <HI>imploy the poor,</HI> that they may <HI>get their own Living</HI> than to &s;upply them by <HI>Alms</HI> in their <HI>Sloth</HI> and <HI>Lazine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Intemperance.</HI> This al&s;o is one &s;inful method, which leads directly to

In&s;pired <HI>So|lomon</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.20 21. <HI>Be not a|mong&s;t Wine-bibbers, among&s;t riotous eat|ers of fle&s;h.

The <HI>Prodigal</HI> Son, <HI>wa&s;ted his Sub&s;tance with riotous living;</HI> and became <HI>&s;o poor,</HI> that he would gladly have filled his belly with <HI>hogs-meat,</HI> if he could, <HI>Luke</HI> 15.13, 16. Per&s;ons &s;hould <HI>eat in due &s;ea&s;on, for &s;trength, and not for drunkenne&s;s.</HI> Eccle&s;. 10.17.

When they indulge Intempe|rance, it unfits them to &s;erve either God or men; it commonly dulls, wea|kens, &s;tupifies their natural abilities, both of body and mind. <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 4.11. <HI>Whoredom, and Wine, and new wine take away the heart.</HI> What an heap of mi&s;|chiefs, does this Sin procure? <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.29, 30. <HI>Who hath wo?

<P>USE. Thus I have mentioned &s;ome of tho&s;e vicious cour&s;es, which tend to bring pinching poverty on per&s;ons. Let us there|fore examine our &s;elves, &s;o far as we have been guilty of any of the&s;e (or any other) vicious practices, we &s;hould be deeply humbled before God for it, and &s;hould penitently fly to the blood of Chri&s;t for pardon. For the future al&s;o, we &s;hould watch again&s;t, and avoid, all tho&s;e vicious cour&s;es which tend to make us mi&s;erably poor. We &s;hould avoid <HI>Idlene&s;s, Intempe|rance, Uncleanne&s;s, bad company, oppre&s;&s;ing, cheating, promi&s;e-breaking;</HI> We &s;hould ca&s;t off <HI>pride</HI> and <HI>extracaganey,</HI> not live above our abilities and &s;o make a prey of our neighbours, while we really &s;pend and &s;ink their Sub&s;tance. We &s;hould be diligent in lawful bui&s;ine&s;s: children and &s;ervants al&s;o &s;hould be well In&s;tructed in Religion, well govern'd, well and diligently Im|ploy'd in bu&s;ine&s;s proper for them. We &s;hould be true to our word and promi&s;e, Ju&s;t, upright and hone&s;t in all our deal|ings; readily and &s;ea&s;onably pay every one his due; do our part hone&s;tly to &s;upport both church and &s;tate, to maintain Gods wor&s;hip, to relieve the poor and nerdy; and we &s;hould <HI>pray to God</HI> for his ble&s;&s;ing on us. If we take this cour&s;e, we need not fright our &s;elves with the fear of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing poverty. Indeed the growing

<P>To conclude all, let us be chiefly con|cern'd, that our <HI>Souls</HI> may be well &s;upply'd and <HI>provided for;</HI> for they're of more worth than our Bodies. <HI>What is a man profited if he &s;hall gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own Soul, or what &s;hall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</HI> Mat. 16.26.

For where your trea&s;ure is, there will your bears be al&s;o.</HI> Yea, if we make it our main bu&s;ine&s;s to plea&s;e God, and lay up trea&s;ures in heaven; this in general is the be&s;t way we can take, to e&s;cape even pinching poverty on earth.
