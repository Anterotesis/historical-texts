<P>MINISTERS of the Go&s;pel are in more re&s;pects than one, fitly compared to <HI>Earthen Ve&s;&s;els;</HI> principally in that they are as <HI>Mortal</HI> as other Men. <HI>Do the Prophets Live for ever?</HI> But more e&s;pecially, in that they are (as <HI>Earthen Ve&s;&s;els</HI> u&s;e to be) of &s;mall account in the World. Chri&s;t's Kingdom not being of this World, He did not make u&s;e of the <HI>Princes of this World,</HI> to be the Di&s;pen&s;ers of the My&s;teries of it. <HI>Not many Mighty, not many Noble are called</HI> to that Work. Yet &s;ome &s;uch there have been: Was not <HI>Solomon</HI> (a great <HI>King</HI> in <HI>I&s;rael</HI>) a PREACHER? Was not <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> of a Noble Romane Family? And <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> of an high Birth? And yet both the&s;e, after they had for &s;ome time plead|ed Cau&s;es at the Bar, out of a de&s;ire to do good, betook them&s;elves to the Study of Divinity, and became fa|mous Preachert of the Go&s;pel. Was not <HI>George</HI> Prince of <HI>Anhall,</HI> a Protes;tant Mini&s;ter, and an Eminent and Succe&s;&s;ful Preacher of Christ? Was there not an Earl who became the Pa&s;tor of a Church in <HI>Geneva?</HI> But <HI>many</HI> Indances there have not been, of honoura|ble Per&s;onages &s;o employed. Our well ob&s;erves, that the Work is <HI>Honourable</HI> enough in it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and needs not borrow any <HI>Additional honour</HI> from the glory
<PB N="ii" REF="001928_0003_0FBA1D1081104EF0">of the World. Al&s;o among <HI>Earthen Ve&s;&s;els</HI> &s;ome are of a finer Mould than others. So among Mini&s;ters, there are &s;ome of a more Tender, others of a more Robu&s;tous Con&s;titution. There are <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Meliore luto pracordia finxit &mdash;</HI> One of the Ancients in his Book, <HI>De Pa&s;torali Cura,</HI> Ob&s;erves that the Apo&s;tle Writing to <HI>Timothy,</HI> Exhorts him to u&s;e <HI>Gentlene&s;s,</HI> and to rebuke with <HI>Long Suffering;</HI> but he bids <HI>Titus</HI> reprove <HI>Sharply,</HI> he &s;uppo&s;eth the rea|&s;on to be, that <HI>Titus</HI> was of a more <HI>Mild</HI> di&s;po&s;ition and needed a Spur: but that <HI>Timothy</HI> was of a more <HI>quick</HI> and <HI>zealous</HI> Temper.</P>
<P>Concerning that Worthy Per&s;on, who&s;e lamented Death occa&s;ioned the Preaching of the Judicious and Sea&s;onable <HI>Sermon</HI> Emitted herewith, I &s;hall not &s;ay much; nor is it needful for me, Con&s;idering it has been done abundantly by Others. I had peculiar rea&s;on to know him, when he was a Student at the College. I then ob&s;erved that he had a Pregnant Wit, and Strong Memory, and was an hard Student, whence it nece&s;&s;a|rily follows that having (as he had) a con&s;iderable time to furni&s;h him&s;elf with variety of Learning, his accompli&s;hments mu&s;t be Eminent. But that which made him chie&s;ly de&s;ireable, was, his Piety. His gifts were Sanctifyed with Grace and the Fear of GOD; from thence it was that when he became a Publick Preacher of the Go&s;pel, he &s;et him&s;elf to promote the Good of Souls, and not to make an o&s;tentation of his own Gifts and Learning. He had a Natural <HI>Fervour</HI> of Spirit, which being Sanctifyed, made his Sermons,
<PB N="iii" REF="001928_0004_0FBA260A24AEB388">by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, the more Powerful &amp; Effectual. His <HI>Death</HI> is the more awful, not only in that he dyed when in his Prime; but in the &s;ame Week another faithful Mini&s;ter of God was taken away, <HI>viz.</HI> The Reverend Mr. <HI>William Brattle,</HI> Pa&s;tor of the Church in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> whom al&s;o I had rea&s;on to have an Intimate acquaintance with, for that I pre&s;ided over the College all the Time of his being a Fellow and a Tutor there; and I had much Comfort in his Conver|&s;ation. Had I not well known his Abilities, I would not have advi&s;ed the precious Church in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> to have Elected and Ordained him their Pa&s;tor, and at their and his de&s;ire, performed that Office of Re&s;pect and Love, on <HI>November 25. 1696.</HI> He that <HI>holds the Stars in his right hand,</HI> was plea&s;ed to uphold him in the Pa&s;toral Office, &s;ome Months above Twenty Years. I am glad to &s;ee his Character already Pub|li&s;hed; and that it is done without any <HI>Hyperbolizing,</HI> that which is there &s;aid of him being true, and nothing but ju&s;tice to his Memory. <HI>Honos fugientem &s;equitur.</HI> He is the more worthy of the honour which has been put upon him, for that (as I am informed) he de&s;ired that no mention &s;hould be made of him in any <HI>Funeral Sermon;</HI> which altho' an evidence of his Humility, does not make it un|lawful for any to act contrary to his de&s;ire in that Matter. It is related concerning that holy <HI>Man of God,</HI> Mr. <HI>Carter,</HI> who was a Mini&s;ter at <HI>Bramford</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> that he forbad any Funeral Sermon to be Preached for him. Notwith&s;tanding which the Re|nowned Mr. <HI>Samuel Ward</HI> of <HI>Ip&s;wich: (<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="iv" REF="001928_0005_0FBA260BED646C20">quantus vir fuit, Scripta loquuntur)</HI> his next Lecture Sermon was a Lamentation, for the Lo&s;s which the Church of God had &s;u&s;tained, in the Death of that Venerable Old Man, who to the admiration of all Men, at Four&s;core, which was the Year of his Death, Preached with as much Vigour as at Forty, without being &s;ubject to any decay in his Intellectuals. Mr. <HI>Brattle</HI> did not arrive to &s;o great an Age. Neverthele&s;s, the Death of &s;uch an <HI>Aaron</HI> as he was, ought to be Lamented by Survivers, <HI>Numb. 20.29. 1 Sam. 25.1. Acts 8.2.</HI> Where &s;hall there be found a &s;uitable Succe&s;&s;or? Since the College is in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the Pastor of the Church there &s;hould be One of very Eminent accompli&s;hments, One of great Learning and Orthodoxy, able to in&s;truct the Scholars, and to e&s;tabli&s;h them in <HI>Calvinian Anti-Arminian</HI> Principles. Should the Learned Youth be tainted with <HI>Arminiani&s;m,</HI> it may prove fatal to the&s;e Churches. My Learned Friend and Brother Mr. <HI>Samuel Lee,</HI> when on his Death-bed, had a great concern on his Spirit about that Matter, &s;ome body having made him believe (unjustly I hope) that the Young Students were advi&s;ed to read <HI>Arminian Authors.</HI> God forbid. <HI>Cambridge</HI> has been lifted up to Heaven. <HI>Hooker, Shepard, Mitchel, Oakes</HI> have been Preachers there. And what Church in the World, did ever enjoy Four &s;uch Preachers Succe&s;&s;ive|ly! Concerning Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> (my mo&s;t dear Friend, whom I can never forget) I remember the admirably Learned Mr. <HI>Chauncey</HI> (who was al&s;o a famous Preacher in <HI>Cambridge</HI> as well as <HI>Pre|&s;ident</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="001928_0006_0FBA2610894F3978">of the College there) when there was &s;ome little difference (and very little did they differ in any poine) between him and Mr. <HI>Mitchel,</HI> altho' Old enough to be his Father, Expre&s;&s;ed his Love and Honour for Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> in the&s;e Words to me. <HI>If I would Envy any Man in the World, either for his Piety, or for his Ability, it would be Mr.</HI> Mitchel.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o of Great Importance to the Intere&s;t of Re|ligion, that the Church in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> lately bereaved, &s;hould be &s;upplyed with another able Mini&s;ter of the New Te&s;tament. And con&s;idering that they have been Exemplary for their Love and Dutiful Re&s;pect to tho&s;e who have been over them in the Lord, and formerly <HI>Spoke to them the Word of God;</HI> It is to be hoped that Chri&s;t will &s;upply them. In the mean Time, I ble&s;s the Lord that they are not wholly de&s;titute, or as Sheep without a Shepherd, but are favoured with One that has been (and I Hope and Pray that for many Tears he &s;hall be) a great Ble&s;&s;ing to them. The Lord with whom is the Re&s;idue of the Spirit, double His Spirit on him. But if they &s;uffer him to be alone too long, under &s;o great a burden, they cannot expect, but that not|with&s;tanding the <HI>Trea&s;ure</HI> which <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> has adorned him with, the Earthen Ve&s;&s;el will break, when too heavy a burden lies too long upon it. Did not <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;ay, <HI>I am not able to bear this People alone, it is too heavy for me,</HI> Numb. <HI>11.14.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="001928_0007_0FBA261208B40AE8">
It is a good Note which a late Writer has, That <HI>Since Mini&s;ters are Earthen Ve&s;&s;els, they &s;hould take heed of da&s;hing one again&s;t another.</HI> In &s;pecial, Let Younger Mini&s;ters take heed of <HI>da&s;hing</HI> again&s;t their <HI>Fathers.</HI> And therefore beware of Introducing <HI>Innovations</HI> which will cau&s;e it to be &s;o, as long as there be any that are Con&s;cientiou&s;ly concerned to maintain <HI>the Old Religion of New-England.</HI></P>
<P>I Conclude with &s;aying, It is a Comfort that al|though the <HI>Earthen Ve&s;&s;els</HI> are broken, the <HI>Trea|&s;ure</HI> is not, nor ever &s;hall be lo&s;t. <HI>The Word of God liveth and abides for ever.</HI></P>

<P>But we have this Trea&s;ure in Earthen Ve&s;&s;els, that the Excellency of the power may be of GOD, and not of us.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the beginning of this Chapter the Apo&s;tle doth declare that he, and his Fellow-Labourers did fulfil their Mi|ni&s;try with unfainting Diligence, and godly Sincerity. He then an&s;wers an Objection which might be made again&s;t the Go&s;pel; in that Multitudes who live un|der the Di&s;pen&s;ation of it, are not &s;avingly Enlightened, but peri&s;h in their Ignorance. To
<PB N="2" REF="001928_0009_0FBA261A11D75648">this the Apo&s;tle an&s;wers, that the fault lay in them&s;elves; Satan the ruler of the darkne&s;s of this World had blinded their minds, le&s;t the Light of the Glorious Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t who is the Image of God, &s;hould &s;hine into them. The Apo&s;tle doth al&s;o mention a won|derful Effect of God's Glorious Power in which the Go&s;pel is made u&s;e of as an In&s;trument, <HI>ver.</HI> 6. This miraculous Irradiation of the mind, the Apo&s;tle compares with that Creating work of God in <HI>commanding the Light to &s;hine out of Darkne&s;s</HI> at fir&s;t. And truly this work of God in the new Creation in forming a New and Divine Light in the Heart of a Sin|ner, is as truly the Effect of Almighty Power, as that was when God &s;aid, <HI>Let there be Light and there was Light.</HI></P>
<P>We have in the Words of our Text, (1) A further De&s;cription of the Go&s;pel. It is a <HI>Trea&s;ure.</HI> (2) The Character of the Di&s;pen|&s;ers of it.

<P N="1">1. We have a De&s;cription of the Go&s;pel. It is a <HI>Trea&s;ure.</HI> We have this Trea&s;ure. A Trea&s;ure, &s;ays One, is an Abundance of Things Repo&s;ited or laid up for the &s;upply of future

<P N="2">2. We have the Character of the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel in whom this Trea&s;ure is laid up, <HI>Earthen</HI> Ve&s;&s;els.

The Go&s;pel is compared, in the Context, to <HI>Light.</HI> Now the Light of the Glorious Go&s;pel by which the King|dom of Darkne&s;s is de&s;troyed, is held forth out of Earthen Ve&s;&s;els; Ve&s;&s;els of baked Earth.

</LIST>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>The Go&s;pel is a Trea&s;ure.</HI> Such is the External Revelation of the Holy Scrip|tures; Much more &s;o, is the Internal Know|ledge of the Glorious Truths and My&s;teries of the Go&s;pel. Nothing doth &s;o much improve and enrich the mind, as the Truth of the Go&s;|pel, when received in the Love of it. For the Proof and Illu&s;tration of this Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Go&s;pel is <HI>a Trea&s;ure, ina&s;much as in the Go&s;pel there's a Plenty, a Fulne&s;s of what
<PB N="5" REF="001928_0012_0FBA261ECA2DA2F8">is mo&s;t Precious and Excellent.</HI> There is a Trea&s;ure wherein is an abundance of what is valuable. Now in the Go&s;pel we have the mo&s;t needful, mo&s;t u&s;eful, Di&s;coveries made unto us: Wi&s;dom &s;ays, Prov. 8.6. <HI>Hear, I will &s;peak of Excellent things, and the opening of my lips &s;hall be right things.</HI> In the Go&s;pel we have the Revelation of <HI>the Glory of God in the Face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Now to know God and Chri&s;t, is Life Eternal. The Excellency of this knowlege is, that it gives Life to the Soul. God is the fir&s;t Truth, and the chief Good. How Precious and Excellent then mu&s;t the knowlege of Him be? We may better want the light of the <HI>Sun,</HI> then the light of the <HI>Go&s;pel.</HI> In the Scriptures we have the Revelation of One GOD in Three Per&s;ons; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t. In the Scriptures we have the Revelation of <HI>that great My&s;tery of Godline&s;s, God manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h.</HI> By the Scriptures God gives the knowlege of Salvation through a Re|deemer to &s;uch peri&s;hing Sinners as we are, who naturally &s;it in Darkne&s;s and the &s;hadow of Death. O Low invaluably precious is this Di&s;covery of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which is made in the Go&s;pel. We are by Nature guilty Sinners, deeply in Debt to Divine Ju&s;tice, and have nothing to pay: Certainly then, the Go&s;|pel is a Rich Trea&s;ure: For in this we have Chri&s;t reveal'd, and offered to us; in whom there is a compleat Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and an in|exhau&s;table
<PB N="6" REF="001928_0013_0FBA26210E452AF0">Stock of Merit; the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Blood of who&s;e Sacrifice being the Blood of Him that is God, is infinitely preci|ous, of value &s;ufficient to be a Redemption-Price for the chief of Sinners. We are by Na|ture <HI>altogether without &s;trength;</HI> empty of Grace, and full of Sin; Certainly then the Go&s;pel is an ine&s;timable Trea&s;ure, in which Chri&s;t is reveal'd and offer'd to us, <HI>of who&s;e fulne&s;s we may receive, and grace for grace.</HI> Chri&s;t who is the Lord in whom <HI>we have Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Strength,</HI> I&s;ai. 45.24. The Graces and Con&s;o|lations of the Spirit are convey'd to Believers by the Mini&s;try of the Word. It is particu|larly &s;aid of Faith, Rom. 10.17. <HI>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word.</HI> 1 Cor. 4.15. <HI>In Chri&s;t Je&s;us I have begotten you through the Go&s;pel.</HI> In the Scriptures the Trea&s;ures of Wi&s;|dom and Knowlege which are hid in Chri&s;t are manife&s;t and laid open. Agreably we have that Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3 8 Unto me who am le&s;s then the lea&s;t of all Saints, is this grace given, that I &s;hould Preach among the Gentiles <HI>the un&s;earchable Riches of Chri&s;t.</HI> In and by the Go&s;pel God makes known what is <HI>the Riches of the glory of this My&s;tery</HI> among the Gentiles which is Chri&s;t in you the hope of Glory. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;ureth us that what things were <HI>gain</HI> to him, he accounted <HI>lo&s;s</HI> for Chri&s;t: yea, &s;ays he, I count all things but <HI>lo&s;s</HI> for the <HI>Excellency of the Knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t my Lord.</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="001928_0014_0FBA26234ADB7EC8">Now we have this knowledge in the Scriptures; The Go&s;pel is <HI>the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t;</HI> and the great Scope and De&s;ign of it is to give us the light of the knowlege of the Glory of God in the Face, in the Per&s;on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Undoubted|ly then the Word of God by which we are taught and in&s;tructed in this knowlege, is to be e&s;teemed an invaluable Trea&s;ure. The ma|nifold Wi&s;dom of God made known in the Scriptures is the <HI>Principal thing.</HI> It is <HI>Better than Rubies, and all the things that may be de&s;ired, are not to be compared with it.</HI> P&s;al. 19. <HI>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul.&mdash; The Judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether. More to be de&s;ired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold,</HI> &mdash; Here are Golden Rules laid down for the government of our Lives. Here are <HI>Exceeding great and precious Promi&s;es that by them we might be made partakers of the Divine Nature;</HI> which is the chief excel|lency and glory of Man, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.4. In the Go&s;pel the Children of God have the <HI>promi&s;e of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</HI> Men are wont to e&s;teem the Writings whereby they hold their E&s;tates: Now in the Sacred Scriptures God makes over Him&s;elf to His People as their Everla&s;ting Portion; and with Him&s;elf all that they need for Soul and Body, Time and Eternity. The Riches of Grace and the Riches of Glory are made &s;ure to Believers in Gods Word. The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath
<PB N="8" REF="001928_0015_0FBA26264F25D690">brought Life and Immortality to light by the Go&s;pel, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.10. The Trea&s;ures which are re&s;erved in Heaven for Gods People, are di&s;covered in the Go&s;pel, and &s;ecured to Belie|vers. Now certainly, the&s;e Spiritual and Ever|la&s;ting Ble&s;&s;ings are very Precious. They are a &s;uitable and &s;ufficient &s;upply for the Immortal Soul, which is our more noble part: they con&s;i&s;t of tho&s;e things which are in their own nature of ine&s;timable value, and which are exactly &s;uited to our wants and nece&s;&s;ities. And then there is enough of them, an abundant plenty and fulne&s;s, every way &s;ufficient to fill all our wants, and &s;atisfy all our de&s;ires. Here's every good thing, and that in abundance. In the Go&s;pel there's an inexhau&s;table <HI>Fountain Opened,</HI> at which we may be filled. A Fountain that can never be drawn dry, but is always full and flowing.

<PB N="9" REF="001928_0016_0FBA2628ECBD8590">The Promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel are made &s;ure; For in Chri&s;t they are Yea, and Amen. But what I de&s;ign to con&s;ider under this Head, is the wonderful care of God's Providence in pre&s;erving the written Word from being lo&s;t, or corrupted: To the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church of Old were committed the Oracles of God. And it is ob&s;erved that the Ancient <HI>Jews</HI> pre&s;erved the Letter of the Scripture entire.

<P>And then as a Trea&s;ure is &s;omething in Re&s;erve for time to come, &s;omething laid up for a time of need: So the fulne&s;s of the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is laid up in Heaven for God's People.

<P>PROP. II. <HI>It hath plea&s;ed God to put this Trea|&s;ure in Earthen Ve&s;&s;els.</HI> God hath committed the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel to Men fitly

Now the Character which is here given to the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel is this, <HI>They are Earthen Ve&s;&s;els.</HI> They are mean, in|firm, dying Creatures. They are indeed di&s;|tingui&s;hed from others in this, that they are betru&s;ted with the Go&s;pel Trea&s;ure, by vertue of their Office, as they are the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST: but in other re&s;pects they are like other Men.

Their Bodies are framed and fa&s;hioned out of the &s;ame Cour&s;e, Earthy Materials; in this regard they are upon a level with their Bre|thren.

They are Children of the <HI>fir&s;t Adam,</HI> in whom we all die; they derive from him both Moral and Natural Corruption. They have the Seeds of Mortality and Corruption in their very Make and Con&s;titution, as well as other Men. They are frail, brittle Ware, feeble, and &s;oon broken. They may &s;ay with <HI>Job</HI> 1.12. <HI>Is my &s;treneth the strength of Stones?

The weight of their work helps many times to weaken and break their Con&s;titution. The concern with which their Solemn Charge doth impre&s;s their Minds, often|times con&s;umes their Spirits. They are wa&s;ted and worn away with the di&s;ticulties they meet with in their Employment.

<P>In a little time they are broken to pieces by the &s;troke of Death. Zech. 1.5. <HI>Your Fathers, where are they? and the Prophets, do they live for ever?

<P>I might have con&s;idered their Moral defects, and infirmities. The Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are Sinful Men. The be&s;t of them groan un|der the remains of the body of Death.

<P>There is an Excellent Power which doth accompany the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel, in the Salvation of Sinners.

<PB N="16" REF="001928_0023_0FBA26391AA84B88">Per&s;ecuted for their work Sake many times, and that even to death. Now the glorious Power of Chri&s;t doth appear in &s;u&s;taining them under the&s;e Pre&s;&s;ures.

And therefore when the Go&s;pel doth run, and is glorified, we mu&s;t fall down before the Throne of Grace, and a&s;cribe Honour and Wi&s;dom, Mercy and Power to God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Di&s;pen|&s;ers of the Go&s;pel <HI>are only Mini&s;ters by whom we believe, even as the Lord gives to every Man.</HI> We
<PB N="24" REF="001928_0031_0FBA264BC3F7AFA0">mu&s;t not look upon them, as if by their own power they wrought tho&s;e wonderful Works, which are effected by the Preaching of the Go&s;|pel, 1 Cor. 3.7. <HI>Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the Increa&s;e.</HI> God is all in all, and therefore He mu&s;t have all the Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>USE. IX. <HI>Is the Go&s;pel Trea&s;ure in Earthen Ve&s;&s;els; Learn, that when the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els are broken, we &s;hould deeply re&s;ent and bewail it.</HI> When God comes and removes &s;uch as did faithfully keep, and di&s;pen&s;e this Trea&s;ure; we &s;hould &s;ee His Hand which is &s;tretched out again&s;t us, and humble our &s;elves under it.</P>
<P>Now God hath in His Providence very lately given us a Demon&s;tration of the Truth of this His Word in Two awful In&s;tances; <HI>viz.</HI> In the Re|moval of Two Eminent Per&s;ons, The Reverend Mr. <HI>WILLIAM BRATTLE,</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Brattle</HI> Expired, <HI>Febr.</HI> 15, 1716, 7.</NOTE> and the Reve|rend Mr. <HI>ERENEZER PEMBERTON,</HI> by Death. I would mention the Name of the Worthy Pa&s;tor of the Church of Chri&s;t in <HI>Cam|bridge</HI> with great Re&s;pect and Honour. His di|ligent Care of his Flock, and Parental Tender|ne&s;s to the Students of the College, mu&s;t not be forgotten. Nor may I pa&s;s by in Silence the many other Charitable and Worthy Deeds done by Him. But my pre&s;ent Province will not per|mit
<PB N="29" REF="001928_0032_0FBA264FB7865718">to enter into &s;o large a Field. To Return therefore to the Mournful Subject which hath been the Occa&s;ion of my pre&s;ent Meditations.</P>
<P>It hath plea&s;ed the Holy GOD, in who&s;e Hands our Times are, to lay this Congregation under the awful Rebukes of His Soveraign Providence by breaking an <HI>Earthen</HI> Ve&s;&s;el in which He had laid up much Precious Trea&s;ure, Trea&s;ure with which we were enriched.</P>
<P>We have a <HI>peculiar</HI> &s;hare in the great Lo&s;s which the Churches of Chri&s;t in this Land do thereby &s;u&s;tain. It becomes us therefore to be humbled under the mighty Hand of God.</P>
<P>In a particular manner, as I have e&s;pecial Rea|&s;on, &s;o I de&s;ire to be deeply humbled under this awful Blow, whereby much of our Strength and Beauty are con&s;umed.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible how unfit I am to give &s;o Great a Man His Character; And this hath been al|ready done by Elder and much Abler Hands.</P>
<P>However the Relation I &s;tand in will not per|mit me to be wholly Silent. Give me leave therefore to make &s;ome E&s;&s;ay to pay a Tribute to the Memory of the Decea&s;ed, who&s;e Prai&s;e is in the&s;e Churches. I &s;hall endeavour to do it with a &s;incere aim at His Glory, who is the Father of
<PB N="30" REF="001928_0033_0FBA265107828410">Lights from whom cometh down every good and perfect Giving.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed God to furni&s;h him with Eminent Gifts and Endowments. And He is ju&s;tly Ce|lebrated as a Great Schokn, an Excellent Divine, and a good Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Might I pre&s;ume to look upon my &s;elf as a com|petent Judge of Learning, and Learned Men, I would &s;ay, He was a very great Proficient in the Study of the Liberal Arts and Sciences.</P>
<P>He had a great Natural Capacity, a Large and Comprehen&s;ive Genius. And by hard study and great Indu&s;try had ama&s;s'd a rich Trea&s;ure of Learning. I &s;uppo&s;e few in the&s;e Corners of the Earth have been better acquainted with Books and Men.</P>
<P>He Read much, and had an Excellent Faculty of dige&s;ting what he Read, and of making it his own. He had the Powers of Rea&s;orning and Ar|guing in an high Degree. He was a great Ma&s;ter of Speech, and was very happy in imparting his Sentiments to others. And we may now take up our Lamentation and &s;ay; <HI>Behold the Lord, the Lord of Ho&s;ts, taketh away &mdash; The Prophet, and the Prudent, &mdash; And the Eloquent Oratour.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="001928_0034_0FBA2652CD5A1740">
The&s;e Rich Talents which His Lord be&s;tow'd freely upon him, he Con&s;ecrated to the Work of the Mini&s;try: and devoted to the Service of Chri&s;t in His Temple; to how good Purpo&s;e, ye are Witne&s;&s;es. He did not hide his Lords Talents in a Napkin; but Occupied with them, <HI>Labouring in the Word and Doctrine.</HI> He did Spend, and was Spent in his Ma&s;ters Service. He was an Able Mini&s;ter of the New Te&s;tament; a Scribe in|&s;tructed to the Kingdom of Heaven; and brought forth out of his Trea&s;ure things New and Old. He was highly e&s;teemed for the Pertinency, Fer|vency, and Copiou&s;ne&s;s of his Expre&s;&s;ion in Prayer. His Di&s;cour&s;es were Elaborate. The Subjects of them were well Cho&s;en, the Method was Accurate, the Style Strong and Ma&s;culine. They were ex|cellently well &s;uited to make his Auditors wi&s;er and better; and he Delivered them with extraor|dinary Fervour.</P>
<P>I account it a great Favour of God that I en|joy'd the Benefit of his Mini&s;try &s;o long.</P>
<P>His Deeds of Charity are now mentioned for a Memorial of him. The Lord grant that his Seed after him may be ble&s;&s;ed!</P>
<P>He had a well In&s;tructed Family. And took care to Wor&s;hip God in his Hou&s;e. His Re|peated Reque&s;ts in his Family Devotions were,
<PB N="32" REF="001928_0035_0FBA265414607610">that there might be a Ble&s;&s;ed Intercour&s;e with Heaven.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed God in His Holy Providence to Ex|erci&s;e him with &s;trong Pains, and that of long continuance, under which he was enabled to expre&s;s him&s;elf with a becoming Submi&s;&s;ion and Re&s;ignation to the Soveraign Di&s;po&s;al of God. And I look upon it to be truly Wonderful, that under &s;uch frequent Returns of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Mala|dies, he was Strengthned and Spirited in &s;o great a mea&s;ure, to perform his Mini&s;terial La|bours in the Hou&s;e of GOD. Herein Gods Power was Ob&s;ervably magnified in Him.</P>
<P>It is a Comfort and Refre&s;hment to us that this bright Lamp of the Sanctuary went out at la&s;t in a Sweet Perfume; that I may borrow the Phra&s;e us'd by him in his Excellent Di&s;cour&s;e on this Subject above a Year agoe.

<P>The&s;e were &s;ome of his La&s;t Words. <HI>I thank God, who hath given me a good Hope through Chri&s;t. Notwith&s;tanding my many Infirmities; both in Publick, and Private; through His Grace, I have been Enabled to be Sincere and Upright before Him. And I can now look for an Hou&s;e not made with Hands Eternal in the Heavens, when this Hou&s;e of my Earthly Tabernacle is di&s;&s;olved. And this Hope is
<PB N="33" REF="001928_0036_0FBA265587CA52E0">built only upon the Merits of Christ, who hath Suffered &s;o much for me; Who Died, and is Ri&s;en again, and Lives for ever, to make Interce&s;&s;ion for me. And upon this Foundation is built my Hope for my Self, my Family, my Church, and the whole I&s;rael of God. And I thank God who hath Enabl'd me, in a Dying Hour, to Expre&s;s this my Hope.</HI></P>
<P>Thus our Worthy Pa&s;tor <HI>being Dead yet Speak|eth.</HI> The Voice of God in the Removal of this his Servant, in almo&s;t the Middle of his Days, Crieth to us; and O that we were Wi&s;e to Hear and Under&s;tand it. The Lord grant that this &s;ore Rebuke of His Providence may be Sanctified to impre&s;s on our Minds tho&s;e Great and Impor|tant Truths which he hath Spoken to us in the Name of the Lord.</P>
<P>The Lord help us to <HI>Remember how we have received and heard.</HI> The Lord help us to bear in Mind how Fervently and Affectionately this his Servant did Be&s;eech us in Chri&s;ts &s;tead to be Reconciled unto God. We have by him been often call'd upon to Come, and accept of the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; and Warned of our Danger of negiecting the Go&s;pel Invi|tations; Particularly in the la&s;t Sermon which he Preached to us, which was from that Solemn and Awakning Subject,

<P>O that &s;uch as have hitherto been deaf to the&s;e Calls, might now have their Ears opened, hear the Voice of the Son of God, and Live.</P>

<P>The Lord Sanctify this Afflictive Di&s;pen&s;ation to us all, and in particular to the Bereaved Fa|mily.
