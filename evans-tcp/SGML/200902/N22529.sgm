<P>THE importance of the pending Treaty with Britain, and the frequent re|ferences, in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of its merits, to the Treaties with France, the Federal Con&s;titution, &amp;c. have induced the Editor to make a compilation of as many of the documents connected with this intere&s;ting &s;ubject, as might be nece&s;&s;ary to enable the reader to decide for him&s;elf, and not take, on tru&s;t, the intere&s;ted quotations of party writers.</P>
<P>From among the multiplicity of publi|cations, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> the "Features of Mr. Jay's Treaty," and the "Vindication" of that in&s;trument, have been &s;elected, as in|cluding nearly all the arguments that have been advanced by the writers on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion.</P>

<P>HIS Britannic Maje&s;ty and the Unit|ed States of America, being de&s;irous by a Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, to termi|nate their differences in &s;uch a manner, as, without reference to the merits of their re&s;pective complaints and preten&s;ions, may be the be&s;t calculated to pro|duce mutual &s;atisfaction and good under&s;tanding: And al&s;o to regulate the commerce and navigation between their re&s;pective countries, territories and people, in &s;uch a manner as to render the &s;ame re|ciprocally beneficial and &s;atisfactory; they have, re&s;pectively, named their plenipotentiaries, and gi|ven them full power to treat of, and conclude, the &s;aid treaty, that is to &s;ay; His Britannic Maje&s;ty has named for his plenipotentiary, the Right Honor|able William Wyndham, Baron Grenville, of Wotton, one of his Maje&s;ty's Privy Council, and his Maje&s;ty's principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; and the Pre&s;ident of the &s;aid United States, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate thereof hath appointed for their plenipotentiary, the Honorable John Jay, Chief Ju&s;tice of the &s;aid Uni|ted States and their envoy extraordinary to his Ma|je&s;ty, who have agreed on and concluded the follow|ing articles:</P>

<PB N="6" REF="029752_0007_0FE25218C331A080">
<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<P>There &s;hall be a firm, inviolable and univer&s;al peace, and a true, and &s;incere friend&s;hip between his Britannic maje&s;ty, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and the United States of America; and between their re|&s;pective countries, territories, cities, towns, and peo|ple of every degree, without exception of per&s;ons or places.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE II.</HEAD>
<P>His maje&s;ty will withdraw all his troops and gar|ri&s;ons, from all po&s;ts and places within the bound|ary lines a&s;&s;igned by the treaty of peace to the Uni|ted States. This evacuation &s;hall take place on or before the fir&s;t day of June, one thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred and ninety-&s;ix, and all the proper mea&s;ures &s;hall in the interval be taken by concert between the government of the United States, and his ma|je&s;ty's governor general in America, for &s;ettling the previous arrangements which may be nece&s;&s;ary re&s;pecting the delivery of the &s;aid po&s;ts: The Uni|ted States in the mean time at their di&s;cretion, ex|tending their &s;ettlements to any part within the &s;aid boundary line, except within the precincts or juri&s;diction of any of the &s;aid po&s;ts. All &s;ettlers and traders within the precincts or juri&s;diction of the &s;aid po&s;ts, &s;hall continue to enjoy, unmole&s;ted, all their property of every kind, and &s;hall be protected therein. They &s;hall be at full liberty to remain there, or to remove with all or any part of their ef|fects; and it &s;hall al&s;o be free to them to &s;ell their lands, hou&s;es, or effects, or to retain the property thereof, at their di&s;cretion; &s;uch of them as &s;hall continue to re&s;ide within the &s;aid boundary lines, &s;hall not be compelled to become citizens of the United States, or to take any oath of allegiance to the government thereof; but &s;hall be at full liberty

&s;o to do if they think proper; and they &s;hall make and declare their election within one year after the evacuation afore&s;aid.

<HEAD>ARTICLE III.</HEAD>
<P>It is agreed that it &s;hall at all times be free to his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and to the citizens of the United States, and al&s;o to the Indians dwelling on either &s;ide of the &s;aid boundary line, freely to pa&s;s and repa&s;s by land or inland navigation, into the re|&s;pective territories and countries of the two parties, on the continent of America (the country within the limits of the Hud&s;on's Bay Company only except|ed) and to navigate all the lakes, rivers, and waters thereof, and freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other. But it is under&s;tood, that this ar|ticle does not extend to the admi&s;&s;ion of ve&s;&s;els of the United States into the &s;ea ports, har|bours, bays, or creeks of his maje&s;ty's &s;aid territo|ries; nor into &s;uch parts of the rivers in his maje&s;ty's &s;aid territories as are between the mouth thereof, and the highe&s;t port of entry from the &s;ea, except in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els trading <HI>bona fide</HI> between Montreal and Quebec, under &s;uch regulations as &s;hall be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of any frauds in this re&s;pect; nor to the admi&s;&s;ion of Briti&s;h ve&s;|&s;els from the &s;ea into the rivers of the United States, beyond the highe&s;t ports of entry for ve&s;&s;els from the &s;ea. The river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi &s;hall, however, ac|cording to the treaty of peace, be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports and places on its ea&s;tern &s;ide, to which&s;oever
<PB N="8" REF="029752_0009_0FE252252DA67278">
of the parties belonging, may freely be re&s;orted to and u&s;ed by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places of the United States, or any of the ports or places of his maje&s;ty in Great Britain.</P>
<P>All goods and merchandize who&s;e importation into his maje&s;ty's &s;aid territories in America, &s;hall not be entirely prohibited, may freely, for the pur|po&s;es of commerce, be carried into the &s;ame in the manner afore&s;aid, by the citizens of the United States, and &s;uch goods and merchandize &s;hall be &s;ubject to no higher or other duties, than would be payable by his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects on the importa|tion of the &s;ame from Europe into the &s;aid territo|ries. And in like manner, all goods and merchan|dize who&s;e importation into the United States &s;hall not be wholly prohibited, may freely, for the pur|po&s;es of commerce, be carried into the &s;ame, in the manner afore&s;aid, by his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and &s;uch goods and merchandize &s;hall be &s;ubject to no higher or other duties, than would be payable by the citizens of the United States on the importation of the &s;ame in American ve&s;&s;els into the Atlantic ports of the &s;aid States. And all goods not pro|hibited to be exported from the &s;aid territories re|&s;pectively, may in like manner be carried out of the &s;ame by the two parties re&s;pectively, paying duty as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>No duty of entry &s;hall ever be levied by either party on peltries brought by land, or inland naviga|tion into the &s;aid territories re&s;pectively; nor &s;hall the Indians pa&s;&s;ing or repa&s;&s;ing with their own pro|per goods and effects of whatever nature, pay for the &s;ame any impo&s;t or duty whatever. But goods in bales, or other large packages unu&s;ual among Indians, &s;hall not be con&s;idered as goods belonging <HI>bona fide</HI> to Indians.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="029752_0010_0FE25226C33C6E20">No higher or other tolls or rates of ferriage than what are or &s;hall be payable by natives, &s;hall be demanded on either &s;ide; and no duties &s;hall be pay|able on any goods which &s;hall be merely carried over any of the portages or carrying places on either &s;ide, for the purpo&s;e of being immediately reim|barked and carried to &s;ome other place or places. But as by this &s;tipulation it is only meant to &s;ecure to each party a free pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s the porta|ges on both &s;ides; it is agreed, that this exemption from duty &s;hall extend only to &s;uch goods as are carried in the u&s;ual and direct road acro&s;s the por|tage, and are not attempted to be in any manner &s;old or exchanged during their pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s the &s;ame; and proper regulations may be e&s;tabli&s;hed to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of any frauds in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>As this article is intended to render in a great degree the local advantages of each party common to both, and thereby to promote a di&s;po&s;ition favour|able to friend&s;hip and good neighbourhood, it is agreed, that the re&s;pective governments will mutu|ally promote this amicable intercour&s;e, by cau&s;ing &s;peedy and impartial ju&s;tice to be done, and nece&s;&s;a|ry protection to be extended to all who may be concerned therein.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE IV.</HEAD>
<P>Whereas it is uncertain whether the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;|&s;ippi extends &s;o far to the northward as to be inter|&s;ected by a line to be drawn due we&s;t from the Lake of the Woods, in the manner mentioned in the trea|ty of peace between his maje&s;ty and the United States: it is agreed that mea&s;ures &s;hall be taken in concert between his maje&s;ty's government in Ame|rica and the government of the United States, for making a joint &s;urvey of the &s;aid river from one degree of latitude below the falls of St. Anthony,

<HEAD>ARTICLE V.</HEAD>
<P>Whereas doubts have ari&s;en what river was truly intended under the name of the river St. Croix, mentioned in the &s;aid treaty of peace, and forming a part of the boundary therein de&s;cribed; that que&s;tion &s;hall be referred to the final deci&s;ion of commi&s;&s;ion|ers to be appointed in the following manner, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>One commi&s;&s;ioner &s;hall be named by his Maje&s;ty, and one by the Pre&s;ident of the United States, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate thereof, and the &s;aid two commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall agree on the choice of a third; or if they cannot &s;o agree, they &s;hall each propo&s;e one per&s;on, and of the two names &s;o propo&s;ed, one &s;hall be drawn by lot in the pre&s;ence of the two original commi&s;&s;ioners. And the three commmi&s;&s;ioners &s;o appointed, &s;hall be &s;worn, impartially to examine and decide the &s;aid que&s;tion, according to &s;uch evidence as &s;hall re&s;pec|tively be laid before them on the part of the Briti&s;h government and of the United States. The &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall meet at Halifax, and &s;hall have power to adjourn to &s;uch other place or places as they &s;hall think fit. They &s;hall have power to appoint a &s;ecretary, and to employ &s;uch &s;urveyors or other per&s;ons as they &s;hall judge nece&s;&s;ary. The &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall, by a declaration under their
<PB N="11" REF="029752_0012_0FE25232AF0B4DF0">
hands and &s;eals, decide what river is the river St. Croix intended by the treaty. The &s;aid declara|tion &s;hall contain a de&s;cription of the &s;aid river, and &s;hall particularize the latitude and longitude of its mouth and of its &s;ource. Duplicates of this decla|ration and of the &s;tatements of their accounts, and of the journal of their proceedings, &s;hall be delivered by them to the agent of his maje&s;ty, and to the agent of the United States, who may be re&s;pectively appoint|ed and authori&s;ed to manage the bu&s;ine&s;s on behalf of the re&s;pective governments. And both parties agree to con&s;ider &s;uch deci&s;ion as final and conclu|&s;ive, &s;o as that the &s;ame &s;hall never thereafter be called in que&s;tion, or made the &s;ubject of di&s;pute or difference between them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE VI.</HEAD>
<P>Whereas it is alleged by divers Briti&s;h mer|chants and others his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, that debts to a con&s;iderable amount, which were <HI>bona fide</HI> contracted before the peace, &s;till remain owing to them by citizens or inhabitants of the United States, and that by the operation of various lawful impedi|ments &s;ince the peace, not only the full recovery of the &s;aid debts has been delayed, but al&s;o the value and &s;ecurity thereof have been, in &s;everal in&s;tances, impaired and le&s;&s;ened, &s;o that by the ordinary cour&s;e of judicial proceedings, the Briti&s;h creditors can|not now obtain, and actually have and receive full and adequate compen&s;ation for the lo&s;&s;es and dama|ges which they have thereby &s;u&s;tained. It is agreed, that in all &s;uch ca&s;es where full compen&s;ation for &s;uch lo&s;&s;es and damages cannot for whatever rea|&s;on be actually obtained, had and received by the &s;aid creditors in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, the United States will make full and complete com|pen&s;ation for the &s;ame to the &s;aid creditors: but it is
<PB N="12" REF="029752_0013_0FE25234873A1CE8">
di&s;tinctly under&s;tood, that this provi&s;ion is to ex|tend to &s;uch lo&s;&s;es only as have been occa&s;ioned by the lawful impediments afore&s;aid, and is not to ex|tend to lo&s;&s;es occa&s;ioned by &s;uch in&s;olvency of the debtors, or other cau&s;es as would equally have operated to produce &s;uch a lo&s;s, if the &s;ame impedi|ments had not exi&s;ted: nor to &s;uch lo&s;&s;es or dama|ges as have been occa&s;ioned by the manife&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">delay or negligence, or wilful omi&s;&s;ion of the claimant.</P>
<P>For the purpo&s;e of a&s;certaining the amount of any &s;uch lo&s;&s;es or damages, five commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall be appointed, and authorized to meet and act in man|ner following, viz. Two of them &s;hall be appoint|ed by his Maje&s;ty, two of them by the Pre&s;ident of the United States by and with the advice and con|&s;ent of the Senate thereof, and the fifth by the unani|mous voice of the other four; and if they &s;hould not agree in &s;uch choice, then the commi&s;&s;ioners named by the two parties &s;hall re&s;pectively propo&s;e one per|&s;on, and of the two names &s;o propo&s;ed, one &s;hall be drawn by lot in the pre&s;ence of the four original commi&s;&s;ioners. When the five commi&s;&s;ioners thus appointed &s;hall fir&s;t meet, they &s;hall, before they proceed to act, re&s;pectively take the following oath or affirmation, in the pre&s;ence of each other, which oath or affirmation being &s;o taken and duly atte&s;ted, &s;hall be entered on the record of their proceedings, viz. <Q>I, <HI>A.

<P>Three of the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall con&s;titute a board, and &s;hall have power to do any act apper|taining to the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ion, provided that one of the commi&s;&s;ioners named on each &s;ide, and the fifth commi&s;&s;ioner &s;hall be pre&s;ent, and all deci&s;ions &s;hall be made by the majority of the voices of the commi&s;|&s;ioners then pre&s;ent. Eighteen months from the day on which the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall form a board, and be ready to proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s, are a&s;&s;igned for receiving complaints and applications; but they are neverthele&s;s authori&s;ed in any particular ca&s;es in which it &s;hall appear to them to be rea&s;onable and ju&s;t, to extend the &s;ame term of eighteen months for any term not exceeding &s;ix months, after the expi|ration thereof. The &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall fir&s;t meet at Philadelphia, but they &s;hall have power to adjourn from place to place as they &s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners in examining the com|plaints and applications &s;o preferred to them, are empowered and required, in pur&s;uance of the true intent and meaning of this article, to take into their con&s;ideration all claims, whether of principal or in|tere&s;t, and balances of principal or intere&s;t, to deter|mine the &s;ame re&s;pectively, according to the merits of the &s;everal ca&s;es, due regard being had to all the circum&s;tances thereof, and as equity and ju&s;tice &s;hall appear to them to require.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am honoured with yours of Augu&s;t 30. Mine of the 7th of that month a&s;&s;ured you that mea&s;ures were taken for excluding from all further a&s;ylum in our ports, ve&s;&s;els armed in them to cruize on nations with which we are at peace, and for the re&s;toration of the prizes the Lovely La&s;s, Prince William Henry, and the Jane of Dublin; and that &s;hould the mea&s;ures for re&s;titution fail in their effect, the Pre&s;ident con&s;idered it as incumbent on the United States to make compen&s;ation for the ve&s;|&s;els.</P>
<P>We are bound by our treaties with three of the belli|gerent nations, by all the means in our power to pro|tect and defend their ve&s;&s;els and effects in our ports, or waters, or on the &s;eas near our &s;hores, and to recover and re&s;tore the &s;ame to the right owners when taken from them. If all the means in our power are u&s;ed, and fail in their effect, we are not bound by our treaties with tho&s;e nations to make compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Though we have no &s;imilar treaty with Great Bri|tain, it was the opinion of the Pre&s;ident, that we &s;hould u&s;e towards that nation, the &s;ame rule, which, under this article, was to govern us with the other nations; and even to extend it to captures made on the high &s;eas, and brought into our ports: if done by ve&s;&s;els which had been armed within them.</P>
<P>Having for particular rea&s;ons, &s;orebore to u&s;e all the means in our power for the re&s;titution of the three ve&s;|&s;els mentioned in my letter of Augu&s;t 7th, the Pre&s;ident thought it incumbent on the United States to make compen&s;ation for them; and though nothing was &s;aid in that letter of other ve&s;&s;els taken under like circum&s;tan|ces, and brought in after the fifth of June, and before the date of that letter, yet when the &s;ame forbearance had taken place, it was, and is his opinion, that compen&s;ation would be equally due.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="029752_0037_0FE2528CB37704B0">As to prizes made under the &s;ame circum&s;tances, and brought in after the date of that letter, the Pre&s;ident determined that all the means in our power &s;hould be u&s;ed for their re&s;titution. If the&s;e fail, as we &s;hould not be bound by our treaties to make compen&s;ation to other powers in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ca&s;e, he did not mean to give an opinion that it ought to be done to Great Britain. But &s;till, if any ca&s;es &s;hall ari&s;e &s;ub&s;equent to that date, the circum&s;tances of which &s;hall place them on &s;imilar ground with tho&s;e before it, the President would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nk compen&s;ation equally incumbent on the United States.</P>
<P>In&s;tructions are given to the governors of the differ|ent &s;tates, to u&s;e all the means in their power for re&s;tor|ing prizes of this la&s;t de&s;cription found within their ports. Though they will of cour&s;e take mea&s;ures to be informed of them, and the general government has given them the aid of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers for this pur|po&s;e, yet you will be &s;en&s;ible of the importance of mul|tiplying the channels of their information as far as &s;hall depend on your&s;elf, or any other per&s;on under your di|rection, in order that the governors may u&s;e the means in their power for making re&s;titution.</P>
<P>Without knowledge of the capture they cannot re&s;tore it. It will always be be&s;t to give the notice to them di|rectly; but any information which you &s;hall be plea&s;ed to &s;end to me, al&s;o, at any time, &s;hall be forwarded to them as quickly as di&s;tance will permit.</P>
<P>Hence you will perceive, Sir, that the Pre&s;ident con|templates re&s;titution or compen&s;ation in the ca&s;es be|fore the 7th of Augu&s;t; and after that date re&s;titution if it can be effected by any means in our power. And that it will be important that you &s;hould &s;ub&s;tantiate the fact, that &s;uch prizes are in our ports or waters.</P>
<P>Your li&s;t of the privateers illicitly armed in our ports is, I believe, correct.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to lo&s;&s;es by detention, wa&s;te, &s;poilation &s;u&s;tained by ve&s;&s;els taken as before mentioned, between the dates of June 5th and Augu&s;t 7th, it is propo&s;ed as a provi&s;ional mea&s;ure, that the collector of the cu&s;toms of the di&s;trict, and the Briti&s;h con&s;ul, or any other per|&s;on

If this &s;hall be agreeable to you, and you will be plea&s;ed to &s;ignify it to me, with the names of the prizes under&s;tood to be of this de&s;cription, in&s;tructions will be given accordingly, to the collectors of the cu&s;toms where the re&s;pective ve&s;|&s;els are.</P>

<HEAD>MR. TAZEWELL's MOTION.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the Pre&s;ident of the United States be informed, that the Senate will not con&s;ent to the ratification of the treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, between the United States and his Bri|tannic Maje&s;ty, concluded at London on the 19th of November, 1794, for the rea&s;ons following&mdash;</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Becau&s;e &s;o much of the treaty as was intend|ed to terminate the complaints, flowing from the inexecution of the treaty of 1783, contains &s;tipula|tions that were not rightfully or ju&s;tly requirable of the United States, and which are both impolitic and injurious to their intere&s;t; and becau&s;e the trea|ty hath not &s;ecured that &s;atisfaction from the Briti&s;h government, for the removal of negroes, in violati|on of the treaty of 1783, to which the citizens of the United States were ju&s;tly entitled.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Becau&s;e the rights of individual &s;tates are by the 9th article of the treaty, uncon&s;titutionally in|vaded.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Becau&s;e, however impolitic or unju&s;t it may generally be, to exerci&s;e the power prohibited by the 10th article, yet it re&s;ts on legi&s;lative di&s;cretion, and ought not to be prohibited by treaty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Becau&s;e &s;o much of the treaty, as relates to commercial arrangements between the parties, wants that reciprocity, upon which alone, &s;uch like ar|rangements ought to be &s;ounded, and will operate ruinou&s;ly to the American commerce and navigati|on.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Becau&s;e the treaty prevents the United States from the exerci&s;e of that controul over their com|merce and navigation, as connected with other na|tions, which might better the condition of their in|tercour&s;e with friendly nations.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="40" REF="029752_0041_0FE2529ACF7C5718">6. Becau&s;e the treaty a&s;&s;erts a power in the Pre|&s;ident and Senate, to controul and even annihilate the con&s;titutional right of the Congre&s;s of the Unit|ed State, over their commercial intercour&s;e with foreign nations.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Becau&s;e, if the con&s;truction of this treaty &s;hould not produce an infraction of the treaties now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the United States and their allies, it is calculated to excite &s;en&s;ations, which may not operate beneficially to the United States.</ITEM>

<P>THE mo&s;t chri&s;tian king, and the thirteen unit|ed States of North America, <HI>to wit,</HI> New Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-bay, Rhode I&s;land, Con|necticut, New York, New Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Dela|ware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Caro|lina, and Georgia, willing to fix, in an equitable and per|manent manner, the rules which ought to be followed relative to the corre&s;pondence and commerce which the two parties de&s;ire to e&s;tabli&s;h between their re&s;pective countries, &s;tates, and &s;ubjects; his mo&s;t chri&s;tian ma|je&s;ty, and the &s;aid united &s;tates, have judged, that the &s;aid end could not be better obtained, than by taking for the ba&s;is of their agreement, the mo&s;t per|fect equality and reciprocity, and by carefully avoid|ing all tho&s;e burden&s;ome preferences, which are u&s;ual|ly &s;ources of debate, embarra&s;&s;ment, and di&s;content&mdash;by leaving al&s;o each party at liberty to make, re&s;pect|ing commerce and navigation, tho&s;e interior regulati|ons, which it &s;hall find mo&s;t convenient to it&s;elf&mdash;and by founding the advantage of commerce &s;olely upon reciprocal utility, and the ju&s;t rules of free intercour&s;e&mdash;re&s;erving withal to each party, the liberty of ad|mitting, at its plea&s;ure, other nations to a participa|tion of the &s;ame advantages.

<P>ART. I. THERE &s;hall be a firm, inviolable, and univer&s;al peace, and a true and &s;incere friend&s;hip, between the mo&s;t chri&s;tian king, his heirs and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, and the united &s;tates of America, and the &s;ubjects of the mo&s;t chri&s;tian king and of the &s;aid &s;tates, and between the countries, i&s;lands, cities, and towns, &s;ituate under the juri&s;diction of the mo&s;t chri&s;|tian king, and of the &s;aid united &s;tates, and the peo|ple and inhabitants of every degree, without excep|tion of per&s;ons or places, and the terms herein after-mentioned, &s;hall be perpetual between the mo&s;t chri&s;|tian king, his heirs, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and the &s;aid united &s;tates.</P>
<P N="2">II. The mo&s;t chri&s;tian king, and the united &s;tates, engage mutually not to grant any particular favour to other nations, in re&s;pect of commerce and navigation, which &s;hall not immediately become common to the other party, who &s;hall enjoy the &s;ame favour freely, if the conce&s;&s;ion was freely made&mdash;or on allowing the &s;ame compen&s;ation, if the conce&s;&s;ion was conditional.</P>
<P N="3">III. The &s;ubjects of the mo&s;t chri&s;tian king, &s;hall pay in the ports, havens, roads, countries, i&s;lands, cities, or towns of the united &s;tates, or any of them, no other or greater duties or impo&s;ts, of what nature &s;oever they may be, or by what name &s;oever called, than tho&s;e which the nations mo&s;t favoured are or &s;hall be obliged to pay: and they &s;hall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges, immunities, and exemptions in trade, navigation and commerce, whether in pa&s;&s;ing from one port in the &s;aid &s;tates to another, or in go|ing to and from the &s;ame, from and to any part of the world, which the &s;aid nations do or &s;hall enjoy.</P>

The &s;ubjects, people and inhabitants of the &s;aid united &s;tates, and each of them, &s;hall not pay in the ports, havens, roads, i&s;les, cities, and places, under the domination of his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty in Europe, any other or greater duties or impo&s;ts, of what nature &s;oever they may be, or by what name &s;oever called, than tho&s;e which the mo&s;t favoured nations are or &s;hall be obliged to pay: and they &s;hall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges, immunities, and exemptions in trade, navigation, and commerce, whether in pa&s;&s;ing from one port in the &s;aid domini|ons in Europe, to another, or in going to and from the &s;ame, from and to any part of the world, which the &s;aid nations do or &s;hall enjoy.</P>
<P N="5">V. In the above exemption is particularly compri&s;|ed, the impo&s;ition of one hundred &s;ols per ton, e&s;tab|li&s;hed in France on Foreign &s;hips, unle&s;s when the &s;hips of the united &s;tates &s;hall load with the merchan|di&s;e of France, for another port of the &s;ame domini|on: in which ca&s;e, the &s;aid &s;hips &s;hall pay the duty a|bove mentioned, &s;o long as other nations the mo&s;t fa|voured &s;hall be obliged to pay it: but it is under&s;tood, that the &s;aid united &s;tates, or any of them, are at liberty, when they &s;hall judge it proper, to e&s;tabli&s;h a duty equivalent in the &s;ame ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The mo&s;t chri&s;tian king &s;hall endeavour, by all the means in his power, to protect and defend all ve&s;&s;els, and the effects, belonging to the &s;ubjects, people, or inhabitants of the &s;aid united &s;tates, or any of them, being in his ports, havens or roads, or on the &s;eas near to his countries, i&s;lands, cities or towns; and to recover and re&s;tore to the right owners, their agents, or attornies, all &s;uch ve&s;&s;els and effects, which &s;hall be taken within his juri&s;diction: and the &s;hips of war of his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, or any convoy &s;ailing un|der his authority, &s;hall upon all occa&s;ions take under their protection, all ve&s;&s;els belonging to the &s;ubjects, people, or inhabitants of the &s;aid united &s;tates, or any of them, and holding the &s;ame cour&s;e, or going the

<P N="7">VII. In like manner the &s;aid united &s;tates, and their &s;hips of war &s;ailing under their authority, &s;hall pro|tect and defend, conformably to the tenor of the pre|ceding article, all the ve&s;&s;els and effects belonging to the &s;ubjects of the mo&s;t chri&s;tian king, and u&s;e all their endeavours to recover, and cau&s;e to be re&s;tored, the &s;aid ve&s;&s;els and effects that &s;hall have been taken within the juri&s;diction of the &s;aid united &s;tates, or any of them.</P>

<P N="9">IX. The &s;ubjects, inhabitants, merchants, com|manders of &s;hips, ma&s;ters, and mariners of the &s;tates, provinces, and dominions of each party re&s;pectively, &s;hall ab&s;tain and forbear to fi&s;h in all places po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or which &s;hall be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the other party.

<P>The re&s;pective plenipotentiaries, empowered to concert the clau&s;es and conditions proper to fulfil the &s;aid intentions, have, after the mo&s;t mature delibe|ration, concluded and determined on the following articles.</P>
<P N="1">I. If war &s;hould break out between France and Great Britain, during the continuance of the pre&s;ent war between the united &s;tates and England, his ma|je&s;ty and the &s;aid united &s;tates &s;hall make it a com|mon

cau&s;e, and aid each other mutually with their good offices, their coun&s;els, and their forces, accord|ing to the exigence of conjunctures, as becomes good and faithful allies.</P>
<P N="2">II. The e&s;&s;ential and direct end of the pre&s;ent de|fen&s;ive alliance is, to maintain effectually the liberty, &s;overeignty, and independence, ab&s;olute and unlimit|ed, of the &s;aid united &s;tates, as well in matters of government, as of commerce.</P>
<P N="3">III. The two contracting parties &s;hall, each on its own part, and in the manner it may judge mo&s;t pro|per, make all the efforts in its power again&s;t their common enemy, in order to attain the end pro|po&s;ed.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The contracting parties agree, that in ca&s;e either of them &s;hould form any particular enterpri&s;e, in which the concurrence of the other may be de&s;ired, the party, who&s;e concurrence is de&s;ired, &s;hall readily and with good faith join to act in concert for that purpo&s;e, as far as circum&s;tances and its own particular &s;ituation will permit. And in that ca&s;e, they &s;hall regulate by a particular convention, the quantity and kind of &s;uccour to be furni&s;hed, and the time and manner of its being brought into action, as well as the advantages which are to be its compen&s;ation.</P>
<P N="5">V. If the united &s;tates &s;hould think fit to attempt the reduction of the Briti&s;h power remaining in the northern parts of America, or the i&s;lands of Bermu|das, tho&s;e countries or i&s;lands, in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;hall be confederated with, or dependent upon the &s;aid u|nited &s;tates.</P>

If his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty &s;hall think pro|per to attack any of the i&s;lands &s;ituated in the gulph of Mexico, or near that gulph, which are at pre&s;ent under the power of Great Britain, all the &s;aid i&s;les, in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;hall appertain to the crown of France.</P>

<P N="10">X. The mo&s;t chri&s;tian king and the united &s;tates agree to invite or admit other powers, who may have received injuries from England, to make a common cau&s;e with them, and to accede to the pre&s;ent alliance, under &s;uch conditions as &s;hall be freely agreed to, and &s;ettled between all the parties.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The two parties guarantee mutually from the pre&s;ent time and for ever, again&s;t all other powers, to wit, the united &s;tates to his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the crown of France in A|merica, as well as tho&s;e which it may acquire by the future treaty of peace: and his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty guarantees; on his part to the united &s;tates, their liber|ty, &s;overeignty, and independence, ab&s;olute and un|limited, as well in matters of government, as com|merce&mdash;and al&s;o their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and the additions or conque&s;ts that their confederation may obtain during the war, from any of the dominions now or heretofore

<P N="12">XII. In order to fix more preci&s;ely the &s;en&s;e and application of the preceding article, the contracting parties declare, that in ca&s;e of a rupture between France and England, the reciprocal guarantee declar|ed in the &s;aid article, &s;hall have its full force and effect, the moment &s;uch war &s;hall break out: and if &s;uch rup|ture &s;hall not take place, the mutual obligations of the &s;aid guarantee &s;hall not commence until the mo|ment of the ce&s;&s;ation of the pre&s;ent war, between the united &s;tates and England, &s;hall have a&s;certained their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. The pre&s;ent treaty &s;hall be ratified on both &s;ides, and the ratification &s;hall be exchanged in the &s;pace of &s;ix months, or &s;ooner, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>In faith whereof the re&s;pective plenipotentiaries, to wit, on the part of the mo&s;t chri&s;tian king, Conrad Alexander Gerard, royal &s;yndic of the city of Stra&s;|bourg and &s;ecretary of his maje&s;ty's council of &s;tate&mdash;and on the part of the united &s;tates, Benjamin Frank|lin, deputy to the general congre&s;s from the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, and pre&s;ident of the convention of &s;aid &s;tate&mdash;Silas Deane, heretofore deputy from the &s;tate of Connecticut&mdash;and Arthur Lee, coun&s;ellor at law, have &s;igned the above articles both in the French and Engli&s;h languages; declaring, neverthele&s;s, that the pre&s;ent treaty was originally compo&s;ed and concluded in the French language; and they have hereunto affix|ed their &s;eals.</P>

<HEAD>Explanation of the <HI>actual &s;itua|tion</HI> of Mr. Jay's Treaty.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FROM THE AURORA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. BACHE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE lately read with attention the treaty be|tween Great-Britain and the United States, as al&s;o the re&s;olution of the &s;enate, conditionally con&s;enting to its ratification&mdash;What the &s;enate intended by this re&s;olution is extremely difficult to di&s;cover. I hope, however, the following remarks will contribute to place it upon the lea&s;t exceptionable ground.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="029752_0085_0FE25342915A2F38">The re&s;olution is in the&s;e words&mdash;</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved that the &s;enate do con&s;ent to, and ad|vi&s;e the pre&s;ident of the United States to ratify, the treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, between his Britannic maje&s;ty and the United States of Ame|rica, concluded at London the 19th of November, 1794, on condition that there be added to the &s;aid treaty, an article, whereby it &s;hall be agreed to &s;u&s;|pend the operation of &s;o much of the twelfth article, as re&s;pects the trade, which his &s;aid maje&s;ty thereby con&s;ents may be carried on between the United States and his i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies, in the manner, and on the terms and conditions therein &s;pecified.</P>
<P>"And the &s;enate recommend to the pre&s;ident to pro|ceed, without delay, to further friendly negociations with his maje&s;ty, on the &s;ubject of the &s;aid trade, and of the terms and conditions in que&s;tion."</P>
<P>So much of the twelfth article of the treaty as is not propo&s;ed to be &s;u&s;pended by the foregoing re&s;olution, is in the&s;e words&mdash;</P>
<P>"And it is further agreed, that at the expiration of the &s;aid term, the two contracting parties will en|deavour further to regulate their commerce, in this re&s;pect, according to the &s;ituation in which his ma|je&s;ty may then find him&s;elf with re&s;pect to the We&s;t-Indies, and with a view to &s;uch arrangements as may be&s;t conduce to the mutual advantage and exten&s;ion of commerce. And the &s;aid parties will then al&s;o re|new their di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and endeavour to agree, whe|ther in any and in what ca&s;es neutral ve&s;&s;els &s;hall pro|tect enemy's property; and in what ca&s;es provi&s;ions and other articles, not generally contraband, may be|come &s;uch. But in the mean time their conduct towards each other in the&s;e re&s;pects, &s;hall be regulated by the articles herein after in&s;erted on tho&s;e &s;ubjects."</P>
<P>The twenty-eighth article of the treaty is in the&s;e words&mdash;</P>
<P>Art. XXVIII. "It is agreed, that the fir&s;t ten articles of this treaty &s;hall be permanent, and that
<PB N="81" REF="029752_0086_0FE253442653D038">
the &s;ub&s;equent articles, except the twelfth, &s;hall be limited in their duration to twelve years, to be com|puted from the day on which the ratifications of this treaty &s;hall be exchanged, but &s;ubject to this conditi|on&mdash;that whereas the &s;aid 12th article will expire by the limitation therein contained, at the end of two years from the &s;igning of the preliminary or other ar|ticles of peace, which &s;hall terminate the pre&s;ent war in which his maje&s;ty is engaged, it is agreed, that proper mea&s;ures &s;hall by concert be taken for bringing the &s;ubject of that article into amicable treaty and di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, &s;o early before the expiration of the &s;aid term, as that new arrangements on that head, may by that time be perfected and ready to take place. But if it &s;hould unfortunately happen, that his maje&s;ty and the United States &s;hould not be able to agree on &s;uch new arrangements, in that ca&s;e all the articles of this treaty, except the fir&s;t ten, &s;hall then cea&s;e and ex|pire together."</P>
<P>If the treaty had been unconditionally con&s;eated to by the &s;enate and ratified by the pre&s;ident, and if no new arrangements in relation to the &s;ubjects of the twelfth article, could be agreed on between the par|ties, before or at the expiration of two years from the termination of the pre&s;ent war, then at that pe|riod the whole of the treaty (except the fir&s;t ten ar|ticles) would expire together&mdash;Except tho&s;e ten arti|cles, the whole treaty is made to depend on the ope|ration of the twelfth article, or its &s;ub&s;titute. When|ever, therefore, the twelfth article cea&s;es to operate, if an agreeable &s;ub&s;titute is not ready to take its place, the whole treaty, except the ten fir&s;t articles, mu&s;t expire with it. It is obviou&s;ly immaterial, whether the determination of the twelfth article is occa&s;ioned by its regular expiration, two years after the termina|tion of the war, or by the con&s;ent of the contracting nations, at an earlier period.&mdash;In either ca&s;e, the ef|fect mu&s;t be the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="029752_0087_0FE25346F8582DD8">The re&s;olution of the &s;enate makes the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the material parts of the twelfth article, a condi|tion upon which they will con&s;ent to the ratification of the treaty. If this condition is not accepted by the Briti&s;h king, every part of the treaty is without the &s;anction of the &s;enate. If it is accepted, then the &s;ub&s;tantial parts of the twelfth article cea&s;e to operate, by the mutual con&s;ent of the contracting nations; and therefore every part of the treaty, ex|cept the fir&s;t ten articles, mu&s;t expire with it. The foundation being taken away, the &s;uper&s;tructure mu&s;t fall.</P>
<P>The &s;enate, aware of this conclu&s;ion, add to their re&s;olution a recommendation to the pre&s;ident, to pro|ceed without delay to procure a &s;ub&s;titute for the twelfth article, by new negociations with the Briti&s;h king. If &s;uch a &s;ub&s;titute can be obtained, &s;o as to begin its operation when the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the twelfth article takes place, then it may be contrived to give exi&s;tence to the whole treaty; but without it, the Briti&s;h king's a&s;&s;ent to the condition contained in the &s;enate's re&s;olution mu&s;t annihilate the whole of the treaty, or at any rate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whole of it except the ten fir&s;t articles.</P>
<P>Under this view of the &s;enate's re&s;olution, it may become a que&s;tion, whether the pre&s;ident can con&s;ti|tutionally complete the final act of ratificaition, with|out again re&s;orting to the &s;enate for their approbation. If new arrangements are made to &s;upply the place of the twelfth article, they mu&s;t form a part of the pre|&s;ent treaty&mdash;They do not now exi&s;t, and con&s;equently they cannot be &s;aid to have obtained the con&s;ent of the &s;enate&mdash;Without the con&s;ent of the &s;enate, a trea|ty cannot con&s;titutionally be made&mdash;If no new ar|rangements are agreed on, and the condition upon which the &s;enate have con&s;ented to the ratification, is a&s;&s;ented to, then as the condition it&s;elf will de&s;troy all the treaty, except the fir&s;t ten articles, the di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion of the que&s;tion, as to the pre&s;ident's con&s;ititu|tional
<PB N="83" REF="029752_0088_0FE2534E1D1D5E80">
power, becomes unimportant, as to all the trea|ty, except the ten fir&s;t articles. The operation of the condition, when a&s;&s;ented to, upon the pre&s;ident's power to ratify the ten fir&s;t articles, is a que&s;tion I do not now intend to examine, becau&s;e the proceed|ings of the &s;enate have unequivocally &s;hown, amid&s;t all their perplexity, that they did not intend to ratify the ten fir&s;t articles in the view of a di&s;tinct ratify the ten fir&s;t articles in the view of a di&s;tinct treaty with Great-Britain.</P>

<HEAD>FROM THE AMERICAN DAILY ADVERTISER. Features of Mr. Jay's Treaty.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I. The origin and progre&s;s of the negociation for the Treaty, are not calculated to excite confidence.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE admini&s;tration of our government have, &s;eemingly at lea&s;t, manife&s;ted a policy fa|vorable to Great Britain, and adver&s;e to France.</P>
<P N="2">2. But the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives of congre&s;s, impre&s;&s;ed with the general ill conduct of Great Bri|tain towards America, were adopting mea&s;ures, of a mild though retaliating nature, to obtain redre&s;s and indemnification. The injuries complained of were, principally, 1&s;t, The detention of the we&s;tern po&s;ts&mdash;2dly, The delay in compen&s;ating for the negroes car|ried off at the clo&s;e of the war&mdash;and 3dly, The &s;poli|ations committed on our commerce. The remedies propo&s;ed were, principally, 1&s;t, The commercial re|gulations of Mr. Madi&s;on&mdash;2dly, The non-intercour&s;e propo&s;ition of Mr. Clarke&mdash;3dly, The &s;eque&s;tration motion of Mr. Dayton&mdash;4thly, An embargo&mdash;and 5thly, Military preparation.</P>
<P N="3">3. Every plan of the legi&s;lature was, however, &s;u&s;|pended, or rather annihilated, by the interpo&s;ition of the executive authority; and Mr. <HI>Jay,</HI> the chief ju&s;|tice of the United States, was taken from his judicial
<PB N="84" REF="029752_0089_0FE25350D93CC120">
&s;eat, to negociate with Great Britain, under the in|fluence of the prevailing &s;entiment of the people, <HI>for the redre&s;s of our wrongs.</HI> Query&mdash;Are not his com|mi&s;&s;ion and the execution of it, at variance? Is any one of our wrongs actually redre&s;&s;ed? Is not an atone|ment to Great Britain, for the injuries which &s;he <HI>pre|tends</HI> to have &s;uffered, a preliminary &s;tipulation?</P>
<P N="4">4. The political dogma of Mr. Jay are well known; his predilection, in relation to France and Great Bri|tain, has not been di&s;gui&s;ed; and even on the topic of American complaints, his reports, while in the office of &s;ecretary for foreign affairs, and his adjudications while in the office of chief ju&s;tice, were not calculated to point him out as the &s;ingle citizen of America, fitted for the &s;ervice in which he was employed. Query&mdash;Do not per&s;onal feelings too often dictate and govern the public conduct of mini&s;ters? But whatever may have been his per&s;onal di&s;qualifications, they are ab&s;orbed in the more important con&s;ideration of the apparent violence committed by Mr. Jay's ap|pointment, on the e&s;&s;ential principles of the con&s;titu|tion. That topic, however, has already been di&s;cu&s;&s;|ed, and we may pa&s;s to the manner of negociating the treaty in England, which was at once ob&s;cure and illu&s;ory. We heard of Mr. Jay's diplomatic honors; of the royal and mini&s;terial courte&s;y which was &s;hewn to him, and of the convivial boards to which he was invited: but, no more! Mr. Jay, enveloped by a dan|gerous confidence, in the intuitive faculties of his own mind, or in the inexhau&s;tible fund of his diplomatic information, neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed nor wi&s;hed for external aid; while the Briti&s;h negociator, be&s;ides his own ac|quirements, entered on the points of negociation, fraught with all the auxiliary &s;agacity of his brother mini&s;ters, and with all the practical knowledge of the mo&s;t enlightened merchants of a commercial nation. The re&s;ult corre&s;ponds with that inau&s;picious &s;tate of things. Mr. Jay was driven from the ground of an injured, to the ground of an aggre&s;&s;ing, party; he
<PB N="85" REF="029752_0090_0FE25352693CF220">
made atonement for imaginary wrongs, before he was allowed ju&s;tice for real ones; he converted the <HI>re&s;ent|ments</HI> of the American citizens (under the impre&s;&s;ions of which he was avowedly &s;ent to England) into <HI>amity and concord;</HI> and &s;eems to have been &s;o anxious to rivet a commercial chain about the neck of America, that he even forgot, or di&s;regarded, a principal item of her own produce (cotton) in order to make a &s;weep|ing &s;acrifice to the in&s;atiable appetite of his maritime antagoni&s;t. But the idea of the treaty, given by Mr. Pitt in an&s;wer to Mr. Fox, who, before he had &s;een, applauded it as an act of liberality and ju&s;tice towards America, was the fir&s;t authoritative alarm to our inte|re&s;ts and our feelings. "When the treaty is laid be|fore the parliament (&s;aid the mini&s;ter) you will be&s;t judge, whether any improper conce&s;&s;ion has been made to America!"</P>
<P N="5">5. The treaty being &s;ent hither for ratification, the pre&s;ident and the &s;enate pur&s;ue the my&s;terious plan in which it was negociated. It has been intimated, that till the meeting of the &s;enate, the in&s;trument was not communicated even to the mo&s;t confidential officers of the government: and the fir&s;t re&s;olution taken by the &s;enate was to &s;top the lips and ears of its members again&s;t every po&s;&s;ibility of giving or receiving inform|ation. Every man, like Mr. Jay, was pre&s;umed to be in&s;pired. In the cour&s;e of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, however, &s;ome occurrences fla&s;hed from beneath the veil of &s;e|crecy; and it is conjectured that the whole treaty was at one time in jeopardy. But the rhetoric of a mi|ni&s;ter (not remarkable for the <HI>volubility of his tongue</HI>) who was brought po&s;t ha&s;te from the country; the danger of expo&s;ing to odium and di&s;grace the di&s;tin|gui&s;hed American characters, who would be affected by a total rejection of the treaty; and the feeble, but operative, vote of a member tran&s;ported from the lan|guor and imbecility of a &s;ick room, to decide in the &s;enate a great national que&s;tion, who&s;e merits he had
<PB N="86" REF="029752_0091_0FE25354003C9F88">
not heard di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; triumphed over principle, argu|ment and decorum!</P>
<P N="6">6. But &s;till the treaty remains <HI>unratified;</HI> for, un|le&s;s the Briti&s;h government &s;hall a&s;&s;ent to &s;u&s;pend the obnoxious twelfth article (in favor of which, however, many <HI>patriotic</HI> members declared their readine&s;s to vote) the whole is de&s;troyed by the terms of the rati|fication: and if the Briti&s;h government &s;hall agree to add an article allowing the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, the whole mu&s;t return for the re-con&s;ideration of the &s;enate. But the forms of my&s;tery are &s;till pre&s;erved by our govern|ment; and attempts to deceive the people have been made abroad, upon a rain pre&s;umption, that the treaty could remain <HI>a &s;ecret,</HI> till it became obligatory as <HI>a law.</HI></P>
<P>For in&s;tance; in <HI>Fenno</HI>'s paper of the 25th of June, it is unequivocally declared, the "the treaty of amity, commerce and navigation was ratified ye&s;terday by the &s;enate of the United States;" and, even while he cor|rects that mi&s;take in the paper of the following day, he commits <HI>an error</HI> of a more extraordinary kind (particularly when we con&s;ider that he is the confi|dential per&s;on, who printed the treaty for the u&s;e of the &s;enate) by a&s;&s;erting, that in the twelfth article, "the United States are prohibited from exporting to Europe from the &s;aid &s;tates, &s;ugar, coffee, cotton and cocoa, <HI>the produce of any of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands."</HI> The fact mu&s;t have been known to Mr. Fenno, that the prohibition operates univer&s;ally; whether the pro|hibited articles are the produce of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, of the Ea&s;t Indies, of the United States, or of any other part of the world. The next e&s;&s;ay to render the envelopements of the treaty &s;till more opaque, appeared in the American Daily Adverti&s;er of the 27th of June. The writer (who is &s;aid to be a member of the &s;enate) likewi&s;e regards the ratifica|tion, in his introduction, as a perfect one; and after giving a glo&s;s to the general texture of the treaty, he a&s;cribes the obnoxious principle of the twelfth article,
<PB N="87" REF="029752_0092_0FE24BBCB8100918">
<HI>to an error which, it appears, has been inadvertently in|troduced.</HI> An error inadvertently introduced into an in&s;trument, which was under the con&s;ideration of the chief ju&s;tice of the United States, and the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, for a term of eight months! and intro|duced too, into a part of that very article, which is made the &s;ole foundation of the whole commercial &s;u|per&s;tructure!! Whenever the twelfth article cea&s;es, the treaty declares, every other article, except the ten fir&s;t articles, &s;hall al&s;o cea&s;e! But the author of that &s;ketch proceeds one &s;tep further&mdash;he &s;ays, "that <HI>every cau&s;e of offence or colli&s;ion</HI> towards the French, &s;eems to have heen &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided, in the progre&s;s of the negociation;" for "no article of the treaty <HI>cla&s;hes in the &s;malle&s;t degree,</HI> with the obligations and engage|ments contracted with that gallant nation!" Let the treaty, &s;peak for it&s;elf&mdash;it is more to be hoped than expected, that the voice of France &s;hould not likewi&s;e be heard in opposition to &s;o bold an a&s;&s;ertion.</P>

<HEAD>III. The Treaty contains a colourable, but no real Reciprocity.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The &s;econd article provides for the &s;urrender of the we&s;tern po&s;ts in June, 1796; but it &s;tipulates, that in the mean time the citizens of the United States &s;hall not &s;ettle within the precincts and juri&s;diction of tho&s;e po&s;ts; that the Briti&s;h &s;ettlers there &s;hall hold and enjoy all their property of every kind, real and per&s;onal; and that when the po&s;ts are &s;urrendered, &s;uch &s;ettlers &s;hall have an election either to remain Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, or to become American citizens. Query&mdash;Were not the we&s;tern po&s;ts, and all their pre|cincts and juri&s;diction, the ab&s;olute property of the United States by the treaty of peace? Query&mdash;What equivalent is given for this ce&s;&s;ion of the terri|tory of the United States to a foreign power? Query&mdash;How far do the precincts and juri&s;diction of the po&s;ts extend? Query&mdash;Does not the treaty give an implied a&s;&s;ent to major Campbell's claim, by adopting its language, as far as the falls of the Miami, and to
<PB N="89" REF="029752_0094_0FE253632E23FB30">
the northern claim upon the territories of New York and Vermont?</P>
<P N="2">2. The third article &s;tipulates that the two contract|ing parties may frequent the ports of <HI>either party</HI> on the ea&s;tern banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. Query&mdash;What ports has Great Britain on the ea&s;tern banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi?</P>
<P N="3">3. The third article likewi&s;e opens an amicable intercour&s;e on the lakes; but excludes us from their &s;ea-ports, and the limits of the Hud&s;on's bay company; and excludes them from navigating our Atlantic rivers, higher than the highe&s;t port of entry in each. Query&mdash;What are the limits of the Hud&s;on's bay company? Query&mdash;What equivalent do the United States obtain for the general freedom of navigation, portage and pa&s;&s;age? For it mu&s;t be remembered, that the Briti&s;h rivers penetrate the heart of the country, but of tho&s;e we can take no advantage; while Great Britain is in fact admitted to all the advantages of which our At|lantic rivers are &s;u&s;ceptible.</P>
<P N="4">4. The &s;ixth and &s;eventh articles provide for &s;ati&s;|fying every demand which Great Britain has been able, at any time, to make again&s;t the United States (the payment of the Briti&s;h debts due before the war, and the indemnification for ve&s;&s;els captured within our territorial juri&s;diction) but the provi&s;ion made for the American claims upon Great Britain, is not equally explicit or efficient in its terms, nor is it co|exten&s;ive with the object.&mdash;Query&mdash;Why is the de|mand for the negroes, carried off by the Briti&s;h troops, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, waved, or abandoned? The pre|amble to the treaty recites an intention to <HI>terminate the differences</HI> between the nations: was not the affair of the negroes a difference between the nations? and how has it been terminated?</P>
<P N="5">5. The ninth article &s;tipulates that the &s;ubjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States, re&s;pectively, who now hold lands within the territories
<PB N="90" REF="029752_0095_0FE25364C358D3A8">
of either nation, &s;hall hold the lands in the &s;ame man|ner as natives do. Query&mdash;What is the relative pro|portion of lands &s;o held? Query&mdash;The effect to revive the claims of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, who, either as traitors or aliens, have forfeited their property within the re&s;pective &s;tates? Query&mdash;The operation of &s;uch a compact on the internal policy of the union, com|bined with the &s;olemn recognition of a colony of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, profe&s;&s;ing and owing allegiance to the Briti&s;h crown, though &s;ettled within the acknow|ledged territory of the United States, by virtue of the &s;econd article?</P>
<P N="6">6. The tenth article declares that neither party &s;hall &s;eque&s;ter or confi&s;cate the debts or property in the funds, &amp;c. belonging to the citizens of the other, in ca&s;e of a war, or of national differences. Great Britain has fleets and armies; America has none. Query&mdash;Does not this, &s;upported by other provi&s;ions, which forbid our changing the commercial &s;ituation of Great Britain, or impo&s;ing higher duties on her than on other nations, deprive the United States of her be&s;t means of retaliation and coercion? Query&mdash;Is it not taking from America her only weapon of defence; but from Great Britain the lea&s;t of two weapons which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es? What is the relative proportion held by the citizens of the contracting na|tions re&s;pectively in the funds, &amp;c. of each other?</P>
<P N="7">7. The twelfth article opens to our ve&s;&s;els, not ex|ceeding &s;eventy tons, an intercour&s;e with the Briti&s;h We&s;t-India i&s;lands, during the Pre&s;ent war, and for two years after: but it prohibits our exporting from the United States, mela&s;&s;es, &s;ugar, cocoa, coffee, or cotton, to any part of the world, whether tho&s;e articles are brought from Briti&s;h, French, or Spani&s;h i&s;lands, or even rai&s;ed (as cotton is) within our own territory.&mdash;Query&mdash;Are ve&s;&s;els of &s;eventy tons equal to main|tain the mo&s;t beneficial part of our trade with the We&s;t-Indies, the tran&s;portation of lumber, &amp;c.? Query&mdash;Do we not <HI>in time of war</HI> (and the continu|ance
<PB N="91" REF="029752_0096_0FE2536E85288E80">
of the privilege for more than two years after the war, depends on the &s;ituation in which his maje&s;ty of Great Britain &s;hall then find him&s;elf in relation to the i&s;lands) enjoy a greater privilege under the tempo|rary proclamations of the colonial governors than this article admits? Query&mdash;Have not the articles, which we are prohibited from exporting, formed of late a valuable part of our trade? Is not cocoa chiefly cul|tivated by the Spaniards? Is not cotton a &s;taple of America? Is our own con&s;umption equal to our im|portation, or growth of the prohibited articles? Will not the want of a vent for any &s;urplus quantity, affect the other branches of our commerce, dimini&s;h the de|mand for &s;hip building, and injure our agriculture? If we are now thrown out of this branch of the carry|ing trade, &s;hall we be ever able to recover it? and, in &s;hort, will not the lo&s;s be of la&s;ting detriment to all our maritime exertions?</P>
<P N="8">8. The thirteenth article admits us to trade in the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements in the Ea&s;t Indies: but it excludes us from any &s;hare in the coa&s;ting trade of that coun|try; it forbids our penetrating the interior of the country, or holding an intercour&s;e with the natives, unle&s;s under a licen&s;e from the local Briti&s;h govern|ment; and it compels us to land all the articles that are there &s;hipped, in the United State. Is not China the independent territory of the emperor? Is not Canton an open port, acce&s;&s;ible to all nations? Do we not obtain there, and at independent places in the Ea&s;t Indies with which we have, at pre&s;ent, an un|interrupted communication, tea, porcelain, nankeens, &s;ilk, &amp;c. upon the principles of a free trade? Does not a very advantageous part of the trade in that quar|ter of the globe, con&s;i&s;t in the exchange of the pro|ducts and manufactures of the Ea&s;t Indies for tho&s;e of China, and <HI>vice ver&s;a?</HI> Do not our importations of Ea&s;t India goods far exceed our con&s;umption? Is not the trade which we carry on with tho&s;e goods in Europe, highly beneficial? Are not &s;ugar and coffee
<PB N="92" REF="029752_0097_0FE2537015C29268">
a part of our importations, from India, and does not the 12th article prohibit our re-exporting them? Does our trade to Europe, founded on the previous intercour&s;e with India, depend on the Briti&s;h licen&s;e; and can it be maintained under the di&s;advantage of a double voy|age? Are we not every voyage making favourable impre&s;&s;ions on the natives of China? Do we not participate at pre&s;ent in the carrying trade of that country? Does not our intere&s;t in it increa&s;e rapidly?</P>
<P N="9">9. The &s;everal articles that regulate the rights and privileges of the contracting parties within their re&s;|pective territories, in ca&s;e either of them is engaged in a war, may cea&s;e in two years after the pre&s;ent war is terminated, and cannot be protracted beyond twelve years. Query&mdash;Are not all the&s;e advantages, in effect, <HI>exclu&s;ively favourable to Great Britain,</HI> a prin|cipal maritime power of Europe; often engaged in wars; and intere&s;ted to obtain for her &s;hips, her colo|nies, and her&s;elf, the ports and &s;upplies of this exten|&s;ive continent?</P>
<P>Is it probable that during the longe&s;t po&s;&s;ible exi&s;t|ence of this treaty (twelve years) America will be engaged in maritime wars, will want Engli&s;h ports as a refuge for men of war, or as a retreat for prizes? Or that it will, during that period, be of importance to her objects, to prevent her enemies from arming in Engli&s;h ports, or &s;elling their prizes there?</P>
<P N="10">10. The twenty-&s;econd article provides for &s;hips of war being ho&s;pitably treated in the ports of the re&s;|pective contracting parties; and that officers &s;hall be treated with the re&s;pect that is due to the commi&s;|&s;ions which they bear? Query&mdash;Could not the principle of reciprocity, as well as humanity, &s;ugge&s;t to Mr. Jay, that &s;ome provi&s;ion &s;hould be made to protect our ci|tizen &s;ailors from the fangs of Briti&s;h pre&s;s gangs in England; and from the horrors of their pri&s;on &s;hips in the We&s;t Indies? Were the commi&s;&s;ions of his Britannic maje&s;ty of more regard than the liberties of American freemen? Or, was it unknown that thou|&s;ands
<PB N="93" REF="029752_0098_0FE25371A555C128">
of our &s;ailors have been occa&s;ionally en&s;laved by the impre&s;s tyranny of the Briti&s;h government? Or that thou&s;ands have lo&s;t their lives in noxious pri&s;ons, while their ve&s;&s;els were carried into Briti&s;h ports for "LEGAL ADJUDICATION?"</P>
<P N="11">11. The fourteenth article provides for a perfect li|berty of commerce and navigation, and for the ac|commodation of traders; but &s;ubject always to the laws and &s;tatutes of the two countries re&s;pectively: Query&mdash;Are not the laws and &s;tatutes of England in|finitely more rigid on the &s;ubjects of this article, than the laws and &s;tatutes of America?</P>

<HEAD>IV. The Treaty is an In&s;trument of Party.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, during the &s;e&s;&s;ion of congre&s;s, in which Mr. Jay's mi&s;&s;ion was projected, evinced the exi&s;tence of two parties, upon the que&s;tion whether it was more our intere&s;t to be allied with the republic of France, than with the monarchy of Great Britain. Query&mdash;Does not the general complexion of the trea|ty decide the que&s;tion in favor of the alliance with Great Britain? Query&mdash;Whether that complexion does not manife&s;tly ari&s;e from the provi&s;ions, for ad|mitting a Briti&s;h colony within our territory in the neighbourhood of the we&s;tern po&s;ts; for admitting the whole Briti&s;h nation without an equivalent into a participation of our territory on the ea&s;tern bank of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi; for naturalizing all the holders of lands; for opening a general intercour&s;e with their traders on the lakes in the interior of our country, ren|dering (as it is idly &s;aid) the local advantages of each party common to both; for regulating the external trade of the two nations with each other; for admit|ting citizens to be puni&s;hed as pirates, who take com|mi&s;&s;ions, &amp;c. from a belligerent power adver&s;e to ei|ther contracting party; for fettering the operations of our treaty with France; for &s;urrendering criminals, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="94" REF="029752_0099_0FE254D00329C8B0">2. The mea&s;ures propo&s;ed by one party to retaliate the injuries offered by Great Britain to our territorial, commercial and political rights, were oppo&s;ed by the other, preci&s;ely as the treaty oppo&s;es them. For in|&s;tance:&mdash;</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) Mr. Madi&s;on projects a regulation of our com|merce with Great Britain, by which the ho&s;tile &s;pirit of that nation might be controuled on the footing of its intere&s;t. The treaty legitimi&s;es the oppo&s;ition which was given to the mea&s;ure in congre&s;s, by de|claring in article fifteen, "that no other or higher du|ties &s;hall be paid by the &s;hips or merchandize of the one party in the ports of the other, than &s;uch as are paid by the like ve&s;&s;els or merchandize of all other nations; nor &s;hall any other or higher duty be impo&s;|ed in one country on the importation of any articles of the growth, produce, or manufactures of the other, than are or &s;hall be payable on the importation of the like articles of the growth, &amp;c. of any foreign country.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) Mr. Clarke propo&s;es to manife&s;t and enforce the public re&s;entment by prohibiting all intercour&s;e be|tween the two nations. The treaty de&s;troys the very right to attempt that &s;pecies of national denunciation, by declaring in the &s;ame article, that "no prohibition &s;hall be impo&s;ed on the exportation or importation of any articles to or from the territories of the two par|ties re&s;pectively, which &s;hall not equally extend to all other nations."</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) But Mr. Dayton moves, and the hou&s;e of re|pre&s;entatives &s;upport his motion, for the &s;eque&s;tration of Briti&s;h debts, &amp;c. to en&s;ure a fund for paying the &s;poliations committed on our trade. The treaty (without regarding the re&s;pect due to the commi&s;&s;ion which is borne by our members of congre&s;s) not only de&s;poils the government of this important in&s;trument to coerce a powerful, yet intere&s;ted adver&s;ary into acts of ju&s;tice, but enters likewi&s;e into a commentary, which, con&s;idering the conduct of one of the branch|es of our legi&s;lature, Lord Grenville, con&s;i&s;tently with
<PB N="95" REF="029752_0100_0FE2537D864C6D40">
decorum, could not have expre&s;&s;ed, or at lea&s;t Mr. Jay, for the &s;ake of our national dignity, ought not to have adopted. The tenth article declares, that "nei|ther the debts due from individuals of the one nation to individuals of the other, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">es nor monies which they may have in the public funds, or in the public or private banks, &s;hall ever, in any event of war or national difference, be &s;eque&s;tered or confi&s;cated, <HI>it being unju&s;t and impolitic,</HI> that debts and engagements contracted and made by individuals having confidence in each other and in their re&s;pective governments, &s;hould ever be de&s;troyed or impaired by national au|thority on account of national differences and di&s;con|tents." The terms are very &s;imilar to tho&s;e that gave Mr. Dayton offence in a &s;peech pronounced by Mr. Ames; and certainly it will be deemed no mitigation, that the charge of committing "<HI>an unju&s;t and impolitic</HI> act," has been wantonly engrafted upon the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn of all in&s;truments,&mdash;a public treaty! Query:&mdash;Would Lord Grenville have con&s;ented to brand his Royal Ma&s;ter with the title of <HI>Great Sea Robber,</HI> if Mr. Jay's urbanity could have permitted him to bor|row the epithet from another member of congre&s;s, in order to in&s;ert it, in the article that relates to the Briti&s;h &s;poliations on our trade? But perhaps, Mr. Jay forgot, that the commentary operated as a reflec|tion on the government of the United States, and on|ly meant it as a reproach to Great Britain, for &s;eque&s;|tering during the late war, and retaining at this mo|ment, the property belonging to Maryland, lying in the bank of England. It might, likewi&s;e, be intend|ed as a &s;atire upon the parliamentary &s;eque&s;tration of French property in the famous "Intercour&s;e Act:" or, perhaps, Mr. Jay anticipated the revolution in Holland, and de&s;igned his commentary as a warning again&s;t the &s;eizing of Dutch property, public and private; which, however, has &s;ince taken place, in &s;pite of his &s;olemn admonition.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="3"><PB N="96" REF="029752_0101_0FE2537F4D01F4C0">3. The trials that had occurred relative to the equipment of French privateers in our ports; and the enli&s;tment of our citizens in the &s;ervice of the repub|lic, had produced &s;ome embarra&s;&s;ment in the cour&s;e of party pur&s;uits. The&s;e are obviated by the treaty. The Briti&s;h nation by which the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia has always been &s;upplied with naval officers, and who&s;e fleets and armies are always crowded with volunteers from other nations, con&s;ents that her &s;ubjects &s;hall not &s;erve again&s;t us; and &s;tipulates that our citizens &s;hall not &s;erve again&s;t her. This contract is made with a power actually engaged in a war; and &s;eldom more than &s;even years clear of one; by a power at peace, not liable, from her local po&s;ition, and political con|&s;titution, to be involved in war, and in &s;trict alliance with the nation again&s;t whom the &s;tipulation will im|mediately operate. Captain Barney and the other Americans, who have joined the arms of France, are thus involved in the mo&s;t &s;erious dilemma. If they expatriate them&s;elves, they may po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape the vengeance of the American government; but will that &s;ave them from the vengeance of Great Britain, who&s;e conce&s;&s;ions on the doctrine of expatriation are not quite &s;o liberal? By the bye, it may here be &s;ea|&s;onably repeated, that while Mr. Jay was &s;o willing to prevent American citizens from <HI>entering</HI> into the &s;ervice of France, he might &s;urely have taken &s;ome pains to &s;ecure them from being <HI>pre&s;&s;ed</HI> into the &s;er|vice of England. He would have found, on enquiry, that the in&s;tances of the latter kind are infinitely more numerous than of the former. But it is enough that the mea&s;ure will be introductory of a law, favourable to the view of a party which reprobates every idea of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the French, and cultivates every means of conciliating the Briti&s;h.</P>
<P N="4">4. It has, likewi&s;e, been thought by &s;ome politici|ans, that the energies of our executive department re|quire every aid that can be given to them, in order more effectually to re&s;i&s;t and controul the popular
<PB N="97" REF="029752_0102_0FE25380DF9B56D0">
branches of the government. Hence we find the treaty-making power employed in that &s;ervice; and congre&s;s cannot exerci&s;e a legi&s;lative di&s;cretion on the prohibited points (though it did not participate in making the ce&s;&s;ion of its authority) without a decla|ration of war again&s;t Great Britain. George the third enjoys by the treaty a more complete negative to bind us as &s;tates, than he ever claimed over us as colonies.</P>

<HEAD>V. The Treaty is a violation of the general principles of neutrality, and is in colli&s;ion with the po&s;itive previous engagements which &s;ub&s;i&s;t between America and France.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. It is a general principle of the law of nations, that during the exi&s;tence of a war, neutral powers &s;hall not, by favor or by treaty, &s;o alter the &s;ituation of one of the belligerent parties, as to enable him more advantageou&s;ly to pro&s;ecute ho&s;tilities again&s;t his adver&s;ary. If, likewi&s;e, a neutral power &s;hall refu&s;e or evade treating with one of the parties, but eagerly enter into a treaty with the other, it is a par|tiality, that amounts to a breach of neutrality. The&s;e po&s;itions may be &s;upported by the authority of the mo&s;t e&s;teemed writers on the &s;ubject; but it will be &s;ufficient in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, to cite the conduct of Great Britain her&s;elf. Thus, it has been adjudged by Lord <HI>Mansfield,</HI> "that if a neutral &s;hip trades to a French colony, with all the privileges of a French &s;hip, <HI>and is thus adopted and naturalized,</HI> it mu&s;t be looked upon as a French &s;hip, liable to be taken." See <HI>Judge Black&s;tone's reports,</HI> I <HI>vol. p.</HI> 315, 314. According to the principle on which this judgment was given, the act of i&s;&s;uing the memorable orders of the 6th of November, 1793, and the con&s;equent &s;eizure of all our ve&s;&s;els, are attempted to be ju&s;tified. Great Britain alleges (when it is injurious to France) that trading with the French i&s;lands, <HI>on a &s;ooting not allowed before the war,</HI> is a breach of neutrality, and
<PB N="98" REF="029752_0103_0FE253826CECCB20">
cau&s;e of confi&s;cation: and, therefore, Great Britain mu&s;t al&s;o admit, at lea&s;t America will not deny, that trading with the Briti&s;h i&s;lands, on a footing not allowed before the war; or, in different words, altering and enlarging the commercial relations of the two countries, is equally a breach of our neutrality towards France. When the, &s;word is found to cut both ways, the party who u&s;es it has no right to complain.</P>
<P N="2">2. That we have on the one hand, evaded the over|tures of a treaty with France, and on the other hand, &s;olicited a treaty from Great Britain, are facts public and notorious. Let us enquire then what Great Bri|tain has gained on the occa&s;ion, to enable her more advantageou&s;ly to pro&s;ecute her ho&s;tilities again&s;t France.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>Great Britain has gained time.</HI> As nothing is &s;ettled by the treaty, &s;he has it in her power to turn all the chances of the war in her favor; and, in the interim, being relieved from the odium and embarra&s;&s;|ment of adding America to her enemies, the current of her operations again&s;t France is undivided, and will of cour&s;e flow with greater vigor and certainty. We have been for &s;o many years &s;atisfied with <HI>the pro|mi&s;es of the treaty of peace,</HI> that Great Britain has cau&s;e to expect at lea&s;t an equal period of credit, for <HI>the promi&s;es of the treaty of amity.</HI> If, indeed, it is true, that the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned by lord Grenville to Mr. Jay, for declining an immediate &s;urrender of the po&s;ts, were, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that the Briti&s;h traders might have time to arrange their out-&s;tanding bu&s;ine&s;s; <HI>a privilege that is expre&s;sly granted by the treaty,</HI> and could not, therefore, furni&s;h a real excu&s;e for delay; and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that the Briti&s;h government might be able to a&s;certain what would be the probable effect of the &s;urrender, on the Indians; <HI>a re&s;ervation that demon&s;trates an intention to be governed by events;</HI> we can very well account for the late exten&s;ive &s;hipment of artillery and ammuni|tion to Canada; and may ea&s;ily calculate the import|ance
<PB N="99" REF="029752_0104_0FE2538E912B2C10">
of <HI>gaining time,</HI> in order to promote the Ameri|can, as well as European, objects of Great Britain.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>Great Britain gains &s;upplies for her We&s;t India colonies;</HI> and <HI>that</HI> for a period almo&s;t limited to the continuance of the war, under circum&s;tances which incapacitate her from furni&s;hing the colonial &s;upplies her&s;elf; and, indeed, compel her to invite the aid of all nations, in furni&s;hing provi&s;ions for her own dome&s;|tic &s;upport. The &s;upplies may be carried to the i&s;lands either in <HI>American</HI> bottoms <HI>not exceeding &s;eventy tons,</HI> or in <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> bottoms of <HI>any tonnage.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>Great Britain gains an advantage over France, by prohibiting the exportation of &s;ugar, &amp;c.</HI> in con&s;equence of which the colonies of France mu&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, remain un&s;upplied with provi&s;ions, &amp;c. as they can only in general pay for them in tho&s;e articles, <HI>who&s;e u&s;e is confined to the American con&s;umption.</HI> It will be remembered, that the produce of the French i&s;lands has of late con&s;tituted a great part of our European remittances. If, therefore, that trade is cut off, and at the &s;ame time, be&s;ides employing <HI>our own &s;mall craft</HI> of &s;eventy tons, Great Britain is al|lowed, <HI>to any extent of tonnage,</HI> to be our We&s;t India factor, it is obvious that our con&s;umption of &s;ugar, coffee, &amp;c. &amp;c. will be abundantly &s;upplied, without maintaining an intercour&s;e with the French, or even with the Ea&s;t Indies, to procure any of tho&s;e articles. Perhaps this method, though le&s;s bold, will be more effectual to prevent our furni&s;hing the French i&s;lands with provi&s;ion, than declaring them to be in a &s;tate of blockade, and &s;eizing the ve&s;&s;els that attempt to vi&s;it them.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) <HI>It is another important gain to Great Britain</HI> (which might, likewi&s;e, have been adverted to under the feature of reciprocity) <HI>that, to any extent of ton|nage, her ve&s;&s;els may carry on the We&s;t India trade for us,</HI> either to &s;upply our dome&s;tic con&s;umption, or European engagements, <HI>&s;ubject to no other or higher duties than our own ve&s;&s;els,</HI> while our own ve&s;&s;els are
<PB N="100" REF="029752_0105_0FE253901F5A0810">
re&s;tricted to a pitiful &s;ize, and circum&s;cribed to a par|ticular voyage. But whatever may be thought of the benefit in acquiring for America even this &s;canty participation in the We&s;t India trade, no one (after the rejection of the twelfth article) will deny that the whole mea&s;ure changes the relative &s;ituation of the two countries, avowedly in favor of Great Britain, and operatively injurious to France; and every &s;uch change is derogatory to our boa&s;ted neutral character.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) <HI>The admi&s;&s;ion of Great Britain to all the commercial advantages of the mo&s;t favored nation, and the re&s;traints impo&s;ed upon our legi&s;lative independence,</HI> as &s;tated in the <HI>party feature</HI> of the treaty, are proofs of predilection and partiality in the American government, which cannot fail to improve the re&s;ources of Great Britain, and to impair the intere&s;ts, as well as the attachments, of France.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) <HI>The a&s;&s;ent to the &s;eizure of all provi&s;ion-&s;hips,</HI> and that, in effect, upon any pretext, at a period when Great Britain is di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for provi&s;ions, as well as France; and when the &s;y&s;tem of <HI>&s;ubduing by famine</HI> has been adopted by the former again&s;t the latter nation, is clearly changing our po&s;ition, as an inde|pendent republic, in a manner detrimental to our ori|ginal ally. That our merchants will be paid a rea|&s;onable profit for their cargoes, &amp;c. may render the mea&s;ure more palatable to us; even under the lo&s;s of the return cargo, the derangement of the voyage, and the de&s;truction of the &s;pirit of commercial enter|prize; but that con&s;ideration cannot render it le&s;s offen&s;ive to France. It may properly be here re|marked, that Sweden and Denmark have obtained, by a &s;pirited re&s;i&s;tance, an actual indemnification for the &s;eizures which have heretofore taken place, and an exemption from all &s;uch outrages in future; while America has only put tho&s;e which are pa&s;t, <HI>in a train of negociation,</HI> and has given a <HI>legitimate effect</HI> to tho&s;e which are to come The order, which the Engli&s;h gazettes &s;ay, has recently been i&s;&s;ued for &s;eizing
<PB N="101" REF="029752_0106_0FE25391AE75C0C8">
American provi&s;ion-&s;hips, on their pa&s;&s;age to France, ought not, therefore, to be complained of, as it is merely an exerci&s;e, by anticipation, of the right granted by the treaty.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) <HI>Great Britain has gained the right of preventing our Citizens from being volunteers in the armies or &s;hips of France!</HI> This is not &s;imply the grant of a new right to Great Britain, but is, at the &s;ame time, a po&s;i|tive deprivation of a benefit, hitherto enjoyed by France. Neither the laws of nations, nor our muni|cipal con&s;titution and laws, prohibited our citizens from <HI>going to another country,</HI> and <HI>there,</HI> either for the &s;ake of honour, reward, or in&s;truction, &s;erving in a foreign navy, or army:&mdash;Colonel <HI>O&s;wald</HI> and many others have done it:&mdash;Captain <HI>Barney</HI> and many others are doing it. But a proclamation mu&s;t i&s;&s;ue to recall all &s;uch volunteers, and puni&s;hment mu&s;t follow di&s;o|bedience, if the twenty-fir&s;t article of the treaty is to be effectuated, as the &s;upreme law of the land.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) <HI>Great Britain has gained a right to treat and puni&s;h as pirates, any of our citizens who &s;hall accept, even while they are in France, any commi&s;&s;ion</HI> to arm a privateer, or letter of marque. It is true, that a &s;imilar provi&s;i|on is contained in other treaties; but we are now on|ly con&s;idering <HI>the alterations</HI> which are made by the treaty under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, in favor of Great Britain, and injurious to France. How far there exi&s;ts a power to define piracy, <HI>by treaty,</HI> will be remarked in deli|neating another feature of Mr. Jay's diplomatic off|&s;pring.</P>
<P N="9">(9.) <HI>Great Britain has doubly gained, by obtaining in our ports, an a&s;ylum for her &s;hips of war, privateers, prizes, &amp;c. and &s;tipulating for an exclu&s;ion of tho&s;e of her ene|mies, other (it is admitted) than France.</HI> The twenty-fourth and twenty fifth articles of the projected trea|ty, are nearly copied from the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting treaty with France. It would be curious, however, to reflect on the very different motives, which mu&s;t ju&s;tify (if the
<PB N="102" REF="029752_0107_0FE2539341EEE368">
idea of a ju&s;tification could in the late in&s;tance be at all admi&s;&s;ible) the&s;e analagous grants. The conce&s;&s;i|on to France was made <HI>when we were at war, and &s;he was not;</HI> it was made upon a certainty of <HI>recipro|cal advantage;</HI> and it was made <HI>as a price</HI> for obtain|ing the aid of <HI>that gallant nation</HI> in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our independence. The conec&s;&s;ion is made to Great Britain <HI>when &s;he is at war, and we are not;&mdash;without any rational pro&s;pect of deriving any reciprocal ad|vantage from it;</HI> and under &s;uch circum&s;tances of in|jury and in&s;ult, as might have admoni&s;hed us to <HI>re&s;erve it as the price for obtaining aid from other nations in re|&s;i&s;ting her ho&s;tilities,</HI> in&s;tead of paying it for &s;miles with|out affection, and promi&s;es without &s;incerity. When we were making treaties with Holland, Pru&s;&s;ia, &amp;c. did we not expre&s;sly exclude them from &s;uch import|ant, and as we have already &s;eriou&s;ly experienced; &s;uch dangerous privileges?</P>
<P>But it will be a&s;ked, perhaps, what mighty benefit has Great Britain gained in this ca&s;e at the expen&s;e of France, &s;ince the prior &s;imiler privileges of France are exclu&s;ive? <HI>An&s;wer:</HI>&mdash;That as the privilege of Great Britain will operate again&s;t every other nation, it will immediately affect the French republic's alli|ance, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, with the United Pro|vinces, which preceded the ratification, at lea&s;t, of the treaty: and it may eventually have the &s;ame perni|cious influence in relation to Pru&s;&s;ia, Spain and Por|tugal, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition to change &s;ides, in the pre|&s;ent war, has been unequivocally expre&s;&s;ed. Thus, though Holland and Pru&s;&s;ia made treaties with us long before Great Britain would admit the idoa of a negociation, and though Spain and Portugal are the only cu&s;tomers, who furni&s;h us with a ready money balance, for the very purpo&s;e of paying our annual accumulation of debt to Britain, the harbours of A|merica are open to their ve&s;&s;els <HI>as prizes,</HI> but &s;hut to them as <HI>friends:</HI> They may be brought hither and &s;old by their enemies; but if they have captured

What hone&s;t, feeling American, could patiently &s;ee an Engli&s;hman, <HI>our &s;un&s;hine ally,</HI> bringing into our ports <HI>as prizes,</HI> the &s;hips of Hol|land, <HI>our ally in the times that tried men's &s;ouls;</HI>&mdash;a repub|lic, indi&s;&s;olubly united with France,&mdash;that earlie&s;t, lat|e&s;t, be&s;t of friends? What hone&s;t, feeling American, even &s;ubmitting to a &s;cene &s;o painful, would willingly a&s;&s;i&s;t in expelling from our ports the &s;hips of Holland, <HI>which had merely retaliated,</HI> by the capture of their foe?</P>
<P N="3">3. But it is time to advert to <HI>the ca&s;es colli&s;ion</HI> be|tween the two treaties; and the&s;e are of &s;uch in nature as to produce a violation of the &s;pirit, though not a po|&s;itive violation of the words of the previous engage|ments, that &s;ub&s;i&s;t between France and America&mdash;They are <HI>cau&s;es of offence, and cla&s;h in the highe&s;t degree.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>By the ninth article of the treaty of alliance with France, we guarantee the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of that nation in Ameri|ca.</HI> It is true, that our &s;ituation is &s;uch as to incapaci|tate, and of cour&s;e to excu&s;e us from a <HI>direct</HI> fulfilment of this guarantee; but it is equally true, that we violate our faith, whenever we do any thing that will, either directly or indirectly, endanger tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Query&mdash;Whether facilitating the means of &s;upplying the Briti&s;h forces in the We&s;t Indies will not be the effect of the arrangements relative to the trade with the Briti&s;h i&s;lands? Query&mdash;Whether re&s;training our intercour&s;e with the French i&s;lands, as a con&s;equence of the treaty already predicated, will not expo&s;e them to want, and of cour&s;e to the nece&s;&s;ity of yielding to their enemies? Does not every &s;uch advantage giv|en to Great Britain, <HI>cla&s;h</HI> with our engagements to France?</P>
<P N="2">(2.) By our treaty with France, and indeed with &s;everal other nations, <HI>it is expre&s;sly &s;tipulated, that free
<PB N="104" REF="029752_0109_0FE253A1D3F7CD18">ve&s;&s;els</HI> &s;hall <HI>make free goods.</HI> At the time of entering into the &s;tipulation, and even at this moment, the maritime &s;trength of France (always &s;uperior to that of Denmark and Sweden, which has, under &s;imilar circum&s;tances, been &s;ucce&s;sful) could command the re&s;pect of the world for her engagements. It is true America neither was, nor is, in a &s;ituation to produce the &s;ame complai&s;ance; and on the ground of that weakne&s;s, France has hitherto candidly di&s;pen&s;ed with a &s;trict performance of the treaty. But though Ame|rica cannot <HI>enforce,</HI> &s;he ought not to <HI>abandon</HI> her en|gagements: &s;he may &s;ubmit to imperious nece&s;&s;i|ty, but <HI>&s;he cannot voluntarily bring into que&s;tion</HI> the right of protecting, as a neutral power, the property of France; while France is not only ready and able to afford her property the &s;tipulated protection, but in conformity to the &s;tipulation, actually <HI>allows the pro|perty of Great Britain to pa&s;s free, under the &s;anction of the American flag.</HI> When, therefore, the treaty with Great Britain <HI>agrees,</HI> that within two years after the termination of the exi&s;ting war, <HI>it &s;hall be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed</HI> "whether in any, and what ca&s;es, neutral ve&s;&s;els &s;hall protect enemies' property"&mdash;<HI>does it not cla&s;h with our previous promi&s;e to France, that free &s;hips &s;hall make free goods?</HI> And when the treaty with Great Britain, in formal and explicit terms, <HI>further agrees,</HI> "that in all ca&s;es where ve&s;&s;els &s;hall be captured or detained, on &s;u&s;picion of having on board enemies' property, &amp;c. <HI>the part which belongs to the enemy &s;hall be made prize</HI> "&mdash;Is not this <HI>an evident colli&s;ion with our previous agreement with France,</HI> and with the &s;ecurity which Briti&s;h pro|perty enjoys in con&s;equence of it? While France ad|heres to her treaty, by permitting <HI>Briti&s;h goods</HI> to be protected by American bottoms, is it hone&s;t, honor|able, or con&s;i&s;tent, on our part, <HI>to enter voluntarily in|to a compact with the enemies of France,</HI> for permitting them to take <HI>French goods</HI> out of our ve&s;&s;els? We may not be able <HI>to prevent,</HI> but ought we to <HI>agree</HI> to the proceeding? Let the que&s;tion be repeated&mdash;Does

not &s;uch an <HI>expre&s;s agreement</HI> cla&s;h with our expre&s;s, as well as implied, obligations to France?</P>
<P N="3">(3.) By enumerating, as contraband articles, in the treaty with Great Britain, certain articles which are declared free in the treaty with France, <HI>we may, con|&s;i&s;tently with the latter, &s;upply Great Britain; but, con|&s;i&s;tently with the former, we cannot &s;upply France.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>our treaty with France</HI> (and indeed, every treaty which we have) expre&s;sly declares, that, "in general all provi&s;ione which &s;erve for the nouri&s;hment of mankind and the &s;u&s;tenance of life; furthermore, all kinds of cotton, hemp, flax, tar, pitch, ropes, cables, &s;ail cloths, anchors and any parts of anchors, al&s;o &s;hips, ma&s;ts, planks, boards and beams of what trees &s;oever; and all other things proper either for building, or repairing &s;hips, and all other goods what|ever, which have not been worked into the form of any in&s;trument for war, by land or by &s;ea, <HI>&s;hall not be reputed contraband."</HI></P>
<P><HI>The treaty with Great Britain</HI> expre&s;sly declares, "that timber for &s;hip building, tar or ro&s;in, copper in &s;heets, &s;ails, hemp and cordage, and generally whatever may &s;erve directly to the equipment of ve&s;|&s;els, unwrought iron, and fir planks only excepted, <HI>&s;hall be objects of confi&s;cation, whenever they are attempt|ed to be carried to an enemy."</HI></P>
<P>Whether this &s;tipulation can be con&s;idered as founded on a principle of <HI>reciprocity,</HI> &s;ince the ar|ticles declared to be contraband are <HI>among our princi|pal exports,</HI> but <HI>among the principal imports of Great Britain,</HI> might have been adverted to, in tracing a former feature of the treaty; but let it be now can|didly an&s;wered, whether it is not <HI>in colli&s;ion</HI> with our previous engagements with France? The <HI>right</HI> to make &s;uch a &s;tipulation, is not, at pre&s;ent, controvert|ed; but only the a&s;&s;ertion, that <HI>exerci&s;ing the right does not cla&s;h in any degree</HI> with the terms and &s;pirit of the French treaty.

<HEAD>VI. The Treaty with Great Britain is calculated to injure the United States, in the friend&s;hip and favor of other foreign nations.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. That the friend&s;hip and favor of France will be affected by the formation of &s;o heterogeneous an alli|ance with her mo&s;t implacable enemy, cannot be doubted, if we rea&s;on upon any &s;cale applicable to the policy of nations, or the pa&s;&s;ions of man. From that republic, therefore, if not an explicit renuncia|tion of all connection with the United States, we may at lea&s;t expect an alteration of conduct: and finding the &s;ucce&s;s which has flowed from the ho&s;tile treat|ment that Great Britain has &s;hown towards us, &s;he may be, at length, tempted to endeavor at <HI>extorting from fear,</HI> what &s;he has not been able to obtain <HI>from affection.</HI> She will, probably, declare Great Britain in a &s;tate of blockade, for the purpo&s;e of &s;eizing our ve&s;&s;els in Europe; and &s;he may in&s;titute courts for "legal adjudication," in order to confi&s;cate our ve&s;&s;els in the We&s;t Indies. <HI>Great Britain will then chuckle at the &s;cene.</HI> No one can doubt that our embarra&s;&s;ments will gratify, not only the avowed objects, but the latent re&s;entments, of that nation. Even if &s;he could obliterate the memory of our revolution, &s;he cannot, with plea&s;ure, behold the &s;ucce&s;sful experiment of a republican &s;y&s;tem of government; nor the rapid ad|vances of a commercial competitor. The moment &s;he has produced a quarrel between America and France, &s;he may exclaim, <HI>"Delenda e&s;t Carthago!"</HI> America is again a colony! How different were the intere&s;ts and di&s;po&s;itions of our tried friend! That our government &s;hould pre&s;erve its purity and inde|pendence&mdash;that our commerce and agriculture &s;hould
<PB N="107" REF="029752_0112_0FE253ADDF89AF48">
attain their zenith&mdash;were views <HI>once</HI> congenial with the policy and affections of the French nation: Heart, head, and hand, &s;he would have joined in promoting them, again&s;t the arts and enmities of all the re&s;t of the world! What a change, then, have we made!</P>
<Q><L>"Look on <HI>this</HI> picture, and on <HI>that:</HI></L>
<L>"The counterfeit pre&s;entment of two <HI>Allies!</HI></L>
<L>"Who would on this fair mountain leave to feed,</L>
<L>"To batten on that moor!</L></Q>
<P N="2">2. During the war, we, likewi&s;e, formed a &s;ea&s;on|able and &s;erviceable treaty with the United Nether|lands; and, &s;hortly after the war, treaties were e&s;ta|bli&s;hed with Sweden, Pru&s;&s;ia, &amp;c. But in order to avoid <HI>even the appearance of cla&s;hing or colli&s;ion</HI> with the French treaty, the powers, thus early in courting our alliance, were not allowed tho&s;e privileges of a&s;ylum for them&s;elves, and of excluding their enemies from our ports, which are conceded in the projected treaty to Great Britain. Have tho&s;e nations no cau&s;e for jealou&s;y and reproach? What principle of policy or ju&s;tice can vindicate the partiality and predilection, that has been thus &s;hown?</P>
<P N="3">3. But the projected treaty (after an affected recog|nition or pre-exi&s;ting public treaties) declares, that while Great Britain and America continue in amity, no future treaty &s;hall be made, incon&s;i&s;tent with the articles, that grant the high and dangerous privileges, that have been mentioned. Every nation of the earth (except France) is thus &s;acrificed to the pride and intere&s;t of Great Britain. And with what motive, or upon what con&s;ideration, is the &s;acrifice made? It has been &s;tated in a former, and will be more fully &s;hewn in a future, feature of Mr. Jay's treaty, that the United States do not enjoy any equivalent for this, nor for any other, conce&s;&s;ion which is made to Great Britain: But the mi&s;chief does not end with the folly of a lop-&s;ided bargain. By granting the&s;e exclu&s;ive privileges to Great Britain, by declaring that no commercial favor &s;hall be conferred on other
<PB N="108" REF="029752_0113_0FE253B0D7830718">
nations, without her participating in them, we have thrown away the &s;ure&s;t means of purcha&s;ing, on any emergency, the good will and good offices of any other power: We cannot even improve the terms of our old treaty with France. For all the advan|tages of trade that Spain, Portugal, Holland, &amp;c. might, and probably would, upon a liberal footing of reciprocity, have given us,&mdash;what have we now left, to offer as the ba&s;is of negociation and compact?</P>
<P N="4">4. The alteration which the treaty makes in the relative &s;ituation of &s;everal nations with America, and the conduct, that is likely to be pur&s;ued by tho&s;e nations, in order to counteract its effect, merit &s;erious reflection. Will Spain &s;ee, without &s;ome &s;olicitude, the partition which we have made with Great Britain, of our territory on the ea&s;tern bank of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi? How would our projected treaty work, if France &s;hould recover Pondicherry, &amp;c. in the Ea&s;t Indies; &s;hould &s;ubdue and retain the We&s;t India i&s;lands; &s;hould &s;tipulate with Spain for the ce&s;&s;ion of Loui&s;iana; and &s;hould conquer Nova Scotia? The curious <HI>cordon,</HI> with which we have allowed Great Britain to circum|vent us (and of which more will be &s;aid hereafter) being thus broken, how are we to calculate the con|&s;equences?</P>
<P N="5">5. Con&s;idering the Indians as a foreign nation, is not the treaty calculated to exalt the character of Great Bri|tain, and to depreciate the character of America, through|out the &s;avage world? What right has Great Britain to negociate for Indians, within the limits of our juri&s;dicti|on? Suppo&s;e the exi&s;ting we&s;tern po&s;ts &s;urrendered, may not Great Britain e&s;tabli&s;h other po&s;ts in a contiguous or more advantageous &s;tation? Is &s;he not left at liberty to pur&s;ue the fur trade in our territory as well as her own? Will not her enterprize in traffic, &s;uperior capital and experience, enable her to monopolize that trade? And will &s;he not in future have the &s;ame motives, and the &s;ame means, to foment Indian ho&s;tilities, that have hitherto been indulged and employed, at the expen&s;e of &s;o much American blood and trea&s;ure?</P>

It may be objected, that we are already involved in &s;ome alliances, that have had a tendency rather to de|&s;troy our public tranquility, than to promote our pub|lic intere&s;t.

<P>One idea more about the boundary of the United States.

The territory then intended to be allotted to the government of the Canadas, was ex|tended by a line running along the northern bounda|ries of the ea&s;tern colonies, along the we&s;tern boun|dary of Penn&s;ylvania, and along the cour&s;es of the Ohio, into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. Since we are left at a lo&s;s for a po&s;itive definition of <HI>the precincts and juri&s;|diction of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, as ceded by the treaty to the &s;ettlers under Briti&s;h titles,</HI> may we not conjecture, that Great Britain contemplates the territorial extent of her original project?

preten&s;ion, and the con&s;tant claim of the Indians, <HI>at the in&s;tigation of the Briti&s;h,</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h the Ohio as a boundary between them and the United States, give &s;ome countenance to &s;uch a conjecture?</P>
<P N="4">4. But &s;hould an American, not &s;timulated by the de&s;ire of travelling into foreign countries, be content to pro&s;ecute the objects of his hone&s;t indu&s;try within the Briti&s;h territorial circle, bounding and con&s;tituting <HI>his own home,</HI> will his condition be much better than the condition of his itinerant fellow citizen? What with the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Briti&s;h colonies and Briti&s;h warehou&s;es; the naturalization of Briti&s;h land-hold|ers; and, in &s;hort, the <HI>unqualified admi&s;&s;ion</HI> of En|gli&s;hmen, owing allegiance to the Briti&s;h crown, throughout our lakes, rivers and territory, while we are <HI>excluded</HI> from their &s;ea-ports, company lands, &amp;c. &amp;c. an American will hardly be able to find elbow|room for him&s;elf and his family. Their pecuniary capital being larger; their means being ea&s;ier; their experience being greater; they mo&s;t inevitably, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, become our merchants, manufac|turers, farmers, &amp;c. &amp;c.

<HEAD>VIII. The Briti&s;h treaty and the con&s;titution of the United States are at war with each other.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Self-pre&s;ervation is the fir&s;t law of &s;ociety, as well as of individuals: It is the radical principle of all political compacts. Nations (&s;ays <HI>Vattel</HI>) are bound to guard <HI>their own pre&s;ervation, and to pur&s;ue
<PB N="117" REF="029752_0122_0FE253D4A41C56C8">
their own perfection.</HI> We have ince&s;&s;ant opportunities, indeed, of ob&s;erving the operation of this univer&s;al rule; in animals of <HI>in&s;tinct,</HI> as well as in animals of <HI>rea&s;on;</HI> in the world of <HI>things,</HI> as well as in the world of <HI>beings.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Self-pre&s;ervation, however, is a relative idea: it relates to the nature of the animal; to the con&s;ti|tution of the &s;ociety. A man may lo&s;e his <HI>human character,</HI> without de&s;troying his <HI>vital exi&s;tence;</HI> and a government may be changed <HI>in its e&s;&s;ence,</HI> without being &s;ubverted <HI>in its forms.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. So, likewi&s;e, without open a&s;&s;ault or po&s;itive violence, the &s;ources of animal life may be poi&s;oned, by the imperceptible contaminations of a luxurious habit: &s;o, without the aid of terror or force, the legitimate foundations of government may be under|mined, by the in&s;idious encroachment of the rulers, and by the &s;edative acquie&s;cence of the people. Go|vernments, indeed, have too generally proved to be a kind of <HI>political chry&s;alis,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing, by progre&s;&s;ive tran&s;|mutations, from the grub of pure democracy, to the butterfly of ab&s;olute monarchy.</P>
<P N="4">4. But it will not <HI>yet</HI> be denied in America, that as the people have the &s;ole right to con&s;titute their government, the rule of <HI>&s;elf-pre&s;ervation</HI> requires, that the government &s;hould be maintained, in practice as well as in theory, <HI>&s;uch as they have con&s;tituted it.</HI> To render it, by any con&s;truction of the written articles of our &s;ocial compact, <HI>other than a republican govern|ment,</HI> would be as fatal a &s;ubver&s;ion, as daring u&s;urpa|tion, or military conque&s;t, could atchieve. For, what real difference does it make to a nation, whether its con&s;titution is <HI>&s;eized upon</HI> by an enterprizing indi|vidual, as in the Swedi&s;h revolution of 1770; or <HI>overthrown</HI> by a triumphant warrior, as in the recent extinction of the Poli&s;h monarchy; or <HI>voted out of doors,</HI> as in the di&s;organizing edicts of the long par|liament of England? Thus, likewi&s;e, for one depart|ment of the government to a&s;&s;ume the authority of

another; or, by con&s;tructive amplifications of its own juri&s;diction, &s;o to monopolize the attributes of go|vernment, as to render the other departments u&s;ele&s;s and inefficient, mu&s;t ever be deemed an effectual &s;ub|ver&s;ion of any con&s;titution. The mode of di&s;tribut|ing and organizing the powers of government, as well as the con&s;ideration of the nature and extent of the powers to be delegated, e&s;&s;entially belongs to the people; and in the body politic, as well as in the body natural, whenever any particular member ab&s;orbs more than its allotted portion of the aliment, that is de|&s;tined to vivify and invigorate the whole, debility and di&s;ea&s;e will infallibly ea&s;ue. After the emperors had u&s;urped the functions, privileges and powers of the &s;enate, and of the popular magi&s;trates of Rome, they pre&s;erved the formalities of the Commonwealth, but they trampled on the liberties of the people. Though the parliaments of France had long been deprived of every deliberative faculty, as the repre&s;entatives of the people, they were &s;ummoned to the la&s;t, as the mini&s;terial officers of the monarch, for the purpo&s;e of regi&s;tering his edicts.</P>
<P N="5">5. The government of the United States, being then theoretically a <HI>republican government,</HI> and with great propriety denominated <HI>a government of departments,</HI> let us proceed to examine how far <HI>the principles of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation,</HI> and the duty of <HI>pur&s;uing the perfection</HI> of our political &s;y&s;tem, are involved in the ratification of the projected treaty with Great Britain.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ection of the &s;econd article of the con&s;titution &s;ays, that "The pre&s;ident &s;hall have power, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the &s;enators pre&s;ent concur."</P>
<P>To the exerci&s;e of this power no immediate qua|lification, or re&s;triction, is attached: but mu&s;t we therefore &s;uppo&s;e that the juri&s;diction of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, like the juri&s;diction a&s;cribed to the Bri|ti&s;h parliament, is omnipotent? To place the author|rity

of our pre&s;ident and &s;enate on the &s;ame footing with the prerogative of the king of Great Britain, will not be commen&s;urate with the objects to which the treaty extends. It mu&s;t be remembered, that the treaty of peace, by which the rights of &s;overeignty and &s;oil were ceded by the king of Great Britain to the United States, was negociated and ratified under the po&s;itive &s;anction of an act of parliament: And it is expre&s;sly &s;tated in <HI>Vattel,</HI> that the king of Great Britain cannot, by <HI>treaty,</HI> confer the rights of citizen|&s;hip on an alien, B.

<P N="6">6. The con&s;equence of admitting this unqualified claim to omnipotence, in tran&s;acting the bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation, would be &s;o ho&s;tile to the principle and pre&s;ervation of our government, that it is an indi&s;pen|&s;able duty (<HI>ob&s;la principiis</HI>) to contravert and re&s;i&s;t it.

<P>Suppo&s;e Great Britain had remarked, that, as her &s;ubjects were con&s;tantly the creditors of the citizens of the United States, &s;he was deeply intere&s;ted in our &s;y&s;tem of bankrupt laws:&mdash;Had the pre&s;ident and two-thirds of the &s;enate, a right to incorporate &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem with the projected treaty?</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;ection empowers <HI>congre&s;s</HI> to <HI>coin money,</HI> to regulate the value thereof, and of <HI>foreign coin,</HI> and fix the <HI>&s;tandards of weights and mea&s;ures.</HI></P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the Birmingham manufacturers offered, on a cheap plan, to &s;upply us with coin? Suppo&s;e Great Britain were plea&s;ed to in&s;i&s;t upon our receiving her guineas at their Engli&s;h value, and upon our promi&s;|ing not to &s;weat, deface, or clip them, according to the current practice of the union? Suppo&s;e France were de&s;irous that we &s;hould adopt the fanciful project of that republic, re&s;pecting weights and mea&s;ures?&mdash;Could all, or any, of the&s;e propo&s;itions be acceded to and e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>by treaty?</HI></P>
<P>The ninth &s;ection of the &s;ame article declares "that the migration or importation of &s;uch per&s;ons as the

<P>Suppo&s;e Mr. Wilberforce had negociated on the part of Great Britain, in&s;tead of Lord Grenville, and had made the prohibition of the importation of &s;laves in|to the United States, in the year eighteen hundred and eight, a <HI>&s;ine qua non:</HI>&mdash;Could the pre&s;ident and two-thirds of the &s;enate admit and legitimize the &s;ti|pulation <HI>by treaty?</HI></P>
<P>By the con&s;titution <HI>congre&s;s</HI> has the power to con|&s;titute tribunals inferior to the &s;upreme court.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e Great Britain de&s;ired, for the future, as well as for the pa&s;t, to e&s;tabli&s;h a tribunal of her own judges in America, for deciding controver&s;ies between Briti&s;h &s;ubjects and American citizens:&mdash;Could this be accompli&s;hed through the medium of a treaty?</P>
<P>By the con&s;titution <HI>congre&s;s</HI> is endowed with the power of declaring war.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e Lord Grenville had in&s;i&s;ted, and Mr. Jay had approved, that the treaty &s;hould be an offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive alliance; and that we &s;hould forthwith join Great Britain in her ho&s;tilities again&s;t France:&mdash;Could the pre&s;ident and &s;enate thus <HI>negociate</HI> us into a war?</P>
<P>By the con&s;titution it is declared, "that no per&s;on holding any office, &amp;c. under the United States, &s;hall, without the con&s;ent of congre&s;s, accept of any pre&s;ent, emolument, office or title of any kind what&s;oever, from any king, prince, or foreign &s;tate."</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e our envoy had been offered a pre&s;ent or a title by the Briti&s;h monarch&mdash;would the con&s;ent of the treaty be tantamount to the con&s;ent of congre&s;s, for the purpo&s;e of approving and ju&s;tifying his accep|tance?</P>

<P>Suppo&s;e Great Britain had &s;tipulated, that as &s;oon as the commi&s;&s;ioners have fixed the &s;um due to her &s;ub|jects for old debts, the pre&s;ident &s;hould draw a warrant for the amount, and that the &s;ame &s;hould be paid out of all public monies in the trea&s;ury of the United States, prior to the payment of any antecedent appro|priation by law:&mdash;Would this be the proper &s;ubject for a treaty, or for an impeachment?</P>
<P N="8">8. But fatigued and di&s;gu&s;ted with di&s;playing, thus hypothetically, the mon&s;trous con&s;equences, which will inevitably flow from <HI>the juri&s;diction, claimed on be|half of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, to bind the United States by any treaty, and in all ca&s;es what&s;oever;</HI> let us parti|cularly examine <HI>the numerous and extravagant infractions</HI> of the con&s;titution, <HI>which the projected treaty actually commits.</HI> Recent as is the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the federal con&s;titution, it is, indeed, to be lamented, that the po&s;&s;ibility of violating it, is not a matter of floating and fluctuating popular opinion; but a matter &s;u&s;cep|tible of fixed and po&s;itive proof. For, who does not recollect, that a bill touching the fundamental princi|ple of the government (its repre&s;entative quality) <HI>af|ter having pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es of congre&s;s, was declared by the pre&s;ident to be uncon&s;titutional; and, therefore, unde|&s;erving of his official approbation and &s;ignature?</HI> Who can forget that a law touching the e&s;&s;ential properties of the judicial department of our government, <HI>after being ratified by every organ of legi&s;lative authority</HI> (the pre&s;ident, &s;enate, and hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives) <HI>was declared by chief ju&s;tice Jay, and his a&s;&s;ociate judges, to be uncon&s;titutional; and, therefore, incapable of being ex|ecuted and enforced?</HI> With &s;uch authoritative prece|dento (and there are many others that might be ad|duced from the tran&s;actions of individual &s;tates) of the po&s;&s;ibility of deviating from the rule and meaning of our con&s;titution, are we to be damned for political he|re&s;y, merely becau&s;e we doubt, or deny <HI>the infallibility
<PB N="123" REF="029752_0128_0FE253F56C347F70">
of Mr. Jay's negociating talents?</HI> And mu&s;t every man be <HI>accur&s;ed</HI> (to u&s;e for a moment the intolerant language of the late &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury, in his character of <HI>the New York Camillus</HI>) who thinks that <HI>the American envoy and the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter were at lea&s;t as likely to mi&s;take, or mi&s;con&s;true, the con&s;titutional boun|daries of the American government, as the pre&s;ident, &s;e|nate, and hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives of the United States?</HI> It is certainly, upon the whole, more candid, and more convincing, to put "the defence" of the treaty upon the <HI>true trading ground,</HI> taken by the New York chamber of commerce;&mdash;to wit,&mdash;<HI>"that we have made as good a market at &s;uch pedlars had a right to expect on the royal exchange; and that we cannot afford to fight, though we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to be plundered."</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Let us proceed, however, in examining the points on which <HI>the Briti&s;h treaty is at war with the American con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>By the con&s;titution of the United States, the JUDI|CIAL POWER</HI> is ve&s;ted in one &s;upreme court, and in &s;uch inferior courts as <HI>the congre&s;s</HI> may from time to time e&s;tabli&s;h; and its juri&s;diction embraces, among other things, <HI>"controver&s;ies between a &s;tate, or citizens thereof, and foreign &s;tates, citizens, or &s;ubjects."</HI></P>
<P><HI>By the treaty a tribunal, other than the &s;upreme court, or any inferior court e&s;tabli&s;hed by congre&s;s,</HI> is erected, with a juri&s;diction to a&s;certain the amount of any lo&s;&s;es or damages &s;u&s;tained "<HI>by divers Briti&s;h</HI> mer|chants and others, his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, <HI>on account of debts,</HI> &amp;c. that &s;till remain owing to them <HI>by citizens or inhabitants</HI> of the United States:" And it is agreed, that in all &s;uch ca&s;es where full compen&s;ation for &s;uch lo&s;&s;es and damages cannot, <HI>for whatever rea&s;on,</HI> be actually had and received by the &s;aid creditors, in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, the United States will make full and complete compen&s;ation, for the &s;ame, to the creditors," &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Remarks.</HI> I. It is the right of every independent nation to e&s;tabli&s;h and maintain a judicial authority,
<PB N="124" REF="029752_0129_0FE253F7845B2C60">
co-exten&s;ive with its territorial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The prin|ciple is indi&s;putable, and it is incidentally recognized by Lord Mansfield and other great lawyers, in the celebrated controver&s;y between the king of Pru&s;&s;ia and Great Britain, relative to the <HI>Sile&s;ia loan.</HI> 2. The con&s;titutional tribunals of the United States were adequate to the admini&s;tration of complete ju&s;tice, in the very ca&s;es for which the treaty provides a &s;pecial tribunal. 3. If it is po&s;&s;ible in any ca&s;e, with any nation, and at any time, to &s;tipulate, <HI>by treaty,</HI> for the erection of a tribunal, in order to a&s;certain and liquidate debts due from citizens to foreigners, may it not be done in every ca&s;e, with every nation, and at every time? 4. Is not <HI>the court of commi&s;&s;ioners,</HI> in effect, <HI>an high court of errors and appeals</HI> for the United States, with power to revi&s;e and rever&s;e every judg|ment, that has been given &s;ince the year 1783, <HI>either in a federal or a &s;tate court,</HI> in every cau&s;e between a Briti&s;h &s;ubject and an American citizen? 5. Wherever the recovery of the principal debt has been protracted by <HI>the forms of law</HI>&mdash;wherever there has been <HI>as abatement of intere&s;t,</HI> by the compromi&s;e of the parties, or the verdict of a jury&mdash;wherever <HI>the debtor has become in&s;olvent; this high court of commi&s;&s;ioners may &s;u&s;tain an appeal,</HI> and can award damages for the detention or lo&s;s of the debt. It is true, the treaty adds, that "this provi&s;ion is to extend to &s;uch lo&s;&s;es only as have been occa&s;ioned <HI>by lawful impediments,"</HI> but <HI>the extent of the di&s;cretion</HI> of the commi&s;&s;ioners, in adjudg|ing what con&s;titutes <HI>a lawful impediment,</HI> is without limitation or controul; and <HI>the nature of the evidence,</HI> by which their minds are to be informed, is without rule or definition; &s;ince (in the language of the treaty) it may be "either according to the legal forms now re&s;pectively exi&s;ting in the two countries, <HI>or in &s;uch other manner as the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e to require or allow."</HI> Thus, not only erecting a court un|known to our con&s;titution, but admitting <HI>a &s;pecies of proof, not recognized by the legal forms of our country.</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="029752_0130_0FE253F916723F10">
6. Let us appeal to Mr. Jay him&s;elf, upon the con|&s;titutionality of &s;uch proceedings. <HI>By an act of con|gre&s;s,</HI> the judges of the circuit courts were required to take, and report to the &s;ecretary at war, certain proofs in the ca&s;e of invalids and pen&s;ioners. The judges refu&s;ed (as we have already noticed) to exe|cute the act, declaring it to be <HI>uncon&s;titutional,</HI> as well on account of the nature of the duty impo&s;ed upon them, as on account of the revi&s;ionary power, which was ve&s;ted in the &s;ecretary at war. <HI>By the treaty,</HI> the pre&s;ident and &s;enate will appoint commi&s;&s;ioners, in conjunction with the king of Great Britain, <HI>to hold a court of appeals from every court in the union;</HI> and to determine <HI>judicial que&s;tions, upon private controversies,</HI> between Briti&s;h &s;ubjects and American citizens. Now, let us a&s;k, whether it is more uncon&s;titutional <HI>for the legi&s;lature</HI> to impo&s;e new and extraordinary du|ties upon a court, <HI>exi&s;ting according to the con&s;titution,</HI> than <HI>for the executive</HI> to create a new and extraordina|ry tribunal, <HI>incompatible with the con&s;titution;</HI> ina&s;much as it can only act upon the alienation of the juri&s;dic|tion, <HI>previou&s;ly and exclu&s;ively</HI> ve&s;ted in our dome&s;tic courts;&mdash;the juri&s;diction of hearing and deciding <HI>ju|dicial que&s;tions, upon private controversies, between Bri|ti&s;h &s;ubjects and American citizens?</HI> 7. But this is not the only infraction of the con&s;titution, involved in the arrangement alluded to&mdash;<HI>the obligation of private contracts is transferred from individuals to the public.</HI> The framers of the con&s;titution, in declaring that "all debts contracted and engagements entered into, before its adoption, &s;hall be as valid again&s;t the United States under tne con&s;titution, as under the confede|ration," could hardly anticipate, that they charged the trea&s;ury of the union with the payment of all the out&s;tanding debts of the individual citizens of America! And when congre&s;s was ve&s;ted with a power "to lay and collect taxes, <HI>to pay the debts</HI> and provide for the common defence and general welfare
<PB N="126" REF="029752_0131_0FE253FAA76870A0">
of the United States;" it certainly was never con|templated, that the government of America became the in&s;urer of every Briti&s;h merchant, again&s;t litigi|ous delays, and fraudulent or accidental bankrupt|cies! It cannot be &s;ugge&s;ted that Great Britain acts in a &s;imilar manner upon our complaints of the &s;po|liations on our trade. For, the injury that we have &s;u&s;tained, originated <HI>in an act of government;</HI>&mdash;the in|jured individuals are, <HI>in the fir&s;t in&s;tance,</HI> bound to apply <HI>to the Briti&s;h courts of ju&s;tice;</HI>&mdash;and the public are only re&s;pon&s;ible <HI>in the la&s;t re&s;ort,</HI> for the individual aggre&s;&s;ors,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>By the con&s;titution of the United States,</HI> congre&s;s is empowered to e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>an uniform rule of naturaliza|tion;</HI> and that power has accordingly been exerci&s;ed in an act that provides, among other things, that "no per&s;on heretofore pro&s;cribed by any &s;tate, &s;hall be ad|mitted a citizen, except by an act of the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate in which &s;uch per&s;on was pro&s;cribed."</P>
<P><HI>By the treaty,</HI> all the Briti&s;h &s;ettlers and traders, within the precincts or juri&s;diction of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, are allowed an election either to remain Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, <HI>or to become citizens of the United States:</HI> And it is agreed, "that <HI>Briti&s;h &s;ubjects</HI> who now hold lands in the territories of the United States, may hold, grant, &s;ell or devi&s;e the &s;ame, to <HI>whom they plea&s;e,</HI> in like manner <HI>as if they were natives;</HI> and that neither they, <HI>nor their heirs or a&s;&s;igns,</HI> &s;hall, &s;o for as may re&s;pect the &s;aid lands, and the legal remedies incident thereto, be regarded <HI>as aliens."</HI></P>
<P><HI>Remarks.</HI> Is not <HI>the treaty at war with the con&s;titu|tion</HI> in this great and delicate point of <HI>naturalization? A Briti&s;h colony</HI> is, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> by the magic of Mr. Jay's pen, converted into an <HI>American &s;ettlement!</HI> Eve|ry <HI>Briti&s;h &s;ubject,</HI> who now holds lands (and when we recollect the recent &s;peculations for the &s;ale of lands, how can we calculate the extent of the adoption?) is, without ordeal or re&s;traint, endowed with all the rights of a <HI>native American!</HI> If it is po&s;&s;ible <HI>by treaty</HI> to give the rights of property to <HI>aliens,</HI> may not <HI>the ci|vil
<PB N="127" REF="029752_0132_0FE25405EAA0AC88">
rights</HI> of the community be di&s;po&s;ed of by the &s;ame potent in&s;truament? If it is po&s;&s;ible <HI>by treaty</HI> to confer citizen&s;hip on the Briti&s;h garri&s;on at Detroit, and its contiguous &s;ettlers, why may we not, <HI>by treaty,</HI> al&s;o confer an in&s;tantaneous citizen&s;hip on <HI>every &s;light of emigrants,</HI> that &s;hall ha&s;ten to our &s;hores from Ger|many or Ireland? It may not be ami&s;s here to inti|mate a doubt of <HI>the power</HI> of the federal government to regulate <HI>the tenure of real e&s;tates:</HI> it is no where ex|pre&s;sly given, and therefore, cannot be con&s;titutional|ly implied; and it &s;eems to be among the nece&s;&s;ary and natural objects of &s;tate legi&s;lation. But let us pre&s;ume (what is highly probable) that there are a|mong&s;t the &s;ettlers within the precincts or juri&s;diction of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, certain <HI>pro&s;cribed per&s;ons;</HI>&mdash;can <HI>the treaty,</HI> in &s;pite of <HI>the law,</HI> re&s;tore them to the rights of citizen&s;hip, without the authoritative a&s;&s;ent of the &s;tate that pro&s;cribed them? Again:&mdash;Is every man who&s;e e&s;tate was liable to confi&s;cation <HI>as a traitor,</HI> or <HI>as an alien,</HI> in con&s;equence of the revolution, en|titled <HI>now to bold lands as a native?</HI> The Fairfax claim in Virginia; the claim of the Penns in Penn&s;yl|vania; and the claims of Galloway, Allen, &amp;c. &amp;c. may hence derive a dangerous principle of re&s;u&s;citati|on. <HI>Look to it well.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>By the con&s;titution, congre&s;s</HI> is empowered to re|gulate <HI>commerce with foreign nations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>By the treaty,</HI> the commerce of the United States, not only directly with Great Britain, but incidentally <HI>with every foreign nation,</HI> is regulated.</P>
<P><HI>Remarks.</HI> There is not a &s;ource of <HI>legi&s;lative juri&s;|diction,</HI> upon the &s;ubject of commerce, which is not ab&s;orbed by this <HI>executive compact.</HI> The power of re|gulating commerce with foreign nations, is expre&s;ly and &s;pecifically given <HI>to congre&s;s:</HI> Can a power &s;o giv|en to one department, be dive&s;ted by implication, in order to amplify and invigorate another power, given in general terms to another department? But more of that hereafter.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="128" REF="029752_0133_0FE25407D6C36098">(4.) <HI>By the con&s;titution, congre&s;s</HI> is empowered to re|gulate commerce with the Indian tribes.</P>
<P><HI>By the treaty,</HI> it is agreed that "it &s;hall at all times be free to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, &amp;c. <HI>and al&s;o to the Indians dwelling an either &s;ide of the boundary line of the United States,</HI> freely to pa&s;s and repa&s;s by land or inland na|vigation, into the re&s;pective territories and countries of the two parties on the continent of America, &amp;c. <HI>and freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other." The treaty,</HI> likewi&s;e, provides, that "<HI>no duty</HI> of entry &s;hall ever be levied by either party <HI>on peltries</HI> brought by land, or inland navigation into the &s;aid territories re&s;pectively; <HI>nor &s;hall the Indians pa&s;&s;ing or repa&s;&s;ing with their own proper goods and effects, of whatever na|ture, pay for the &s;ame any impo&s;t or duty whatever."</HI></P>
<P><HI>Remarks.</HI> It is ea&s;y to perceive that the &s;tipula|tions, <HI>in favour of the Indians,</HI> were introduced at the in&s;tance of Great Britain; and her motives are not even attempted to be di&s;gui&s;ed. Her traders will boast of the favor and &s;ecurity, which &s;he has compelled Ame|rica to grant to the Indians; and &s;o engage their confi|dence and attachment; while the privilege of free pa&s;|&s;age and the exemption from duties, will inevitably throw the whole fur trade into the hands of the Briti&s;h. <HI>The &s;urrender of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, can produce no lo&s;s to Great Britain, and will certainly be of no advantage to America:</HI> It will not add a &s;hilling to the profits of our Indian traffic; nor in&s;ure us a moment's &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of Indian ho&s;tilities! But to pro&s;ecute our <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> enquiry&mdash;what right is these by <HI>treaty</HI> to regulate our commerce with the Indian tribes? Whenever a treaty of peace and amity has <HI>here|tofore</HI> been concluded with the Indians, it has been <HI>the con&s;titutional practice of the pre&s;ident, to call on congre&s;s to regulate the commerce with them.</HI> Such calls were to|tally unnece&s;&s;ary, if the &s;ame thing might as well and as lawfully be done <HI>by treaty;</HI> and if it could not be done <HI>by treaty in the ca&s;e of the Indians,</HI> neither could it be done <HI>by treaty in the ca&s;e of a foreign nation:</HI> For,

both are expre&s;&s;ed <HI>in the &s;ame terms,</HI> and included <HI>in the &s;ame member</HI> of the &s;ection. "Congre&s;s &s;hall have power (&s;ays the con&s;titution) to regulate commerce <HI>with foreign nations,</HI> and among the &s;everal &s;tates, and <HI>with the Indian tribes."</HI> What right is there by <HI>treaty</HI> to declare, that <HI>no duty</HI> of entry &s;hall ever be levied by either party <HI>on peltries, &amp;c.</HI> (and a &s;imilar promi&s;e is made in ca&s;es that more immediately affect Great Britain) &s;ince <HI>congre&s;s</HI> has the &s;ole power to lay and col|lect taxes, <HI>duties,</HI> &amp;c. to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence, and general welfare of the Uni|ted States?

And then what becomes of that part of our con&s;titution, which declares, "that <HI>all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for rai&s;ing revenue &s;hall originate in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives?"</HI> But let as imagine for a moment, that it is in the power of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate to regulate our commerce with the Indian tribes; <HI>ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the regulation to be made with the Indians them&s;elves?</HI> Why &s;uffer Great Britain to negociate and &s;tipulate for Indians actually re&s;id|ing within the territory of the United States? Is &s;uch a conce&s;&s;ion con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity and inde|pendence of our government&mdash;with the peace and in|tere&s;t of the nation? Let Mr. Randolph's letter to Mr. Hammond, on the conduct of General Simcoe and Major Campbell be referred to, as an an&s;wer to this que&s;tion. It is not, at pre&s;ent, within reach to be quoted; but its contents were too important to have already e&s;caped the memory of any reflecting American.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) <HI>By the con&s;titution</HI> congre&s;s is empowered <HI>to de|fine and puni&s;h piracies and felonies committed on the high &s;eas, and offences again&s;t the law of nations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>By the treaty</HI> the definition and puni&s;hment of cer|tain offences, not known by any law of the union, is declared and permitted; to wit&mdash;I&s;t, For accepting commi&s;&s;ions or in&s;tructions from any foreign prince or

<P><HI>Remarks.</HI> To define crimes, and apportion puni&s;h|ments, is the peculiar province of <HI>the legi&s;lative autho|rity</HI> of every free government: but it is obvious from the foregoing recapitulation, that <HI>the executive autho|rity</HI> has likewi&s;e encroached upon that province, by the in&s;trumentality of its <HI>treaty-making</HI> power. Can a citizen be &s;urrendered <HI>by treaty</HI> to all the pains and penalties of <HI>piracy?</HI> Then <HI>by treaty,</HI> he might be &s;ub|jected to all the pains and penalties of <HI>trea&s;on.</HI> It is true, that the con&s;titution re&s;erves to it&s;elf <HI>the exclu|&s;ive right</HI> of declaring what &s;hall con&s;titute <HI>trea&s;on;</HI> but it is equally true, that it be&s;tows <HI>on congre&s;s the exclu&s;ive right</HI> to define and puni&s;h <HI>piracy:</HI> and the in|va&s;ion of <HI>the right to define</HI> in one ca&s;e, is as uncon&s;ti|tutitonal as the inva&s;ion of <HI>an actual definition</HI> in the o|ther. But what legitimate authority can <HI>a treaty</HI> &s;ug|ge&s;t, in order to ju&s;tify the re&s;traint upon that right of expatriation, which congre&s;s it&s;elf has not ventured to re&s;train, while legi&s;lating on &s;ubjects of a &s;imilar cla&s;s? It is not intended to convey the &s;lighte&s;t doubt of the power and propriety of controuling our citi|zens in their conduct towards <HI>foreign nations,</HI> while they are within the reach of <HI>dome&s;tic coercion:</HI> but to prohibit an American freeman from going whither he plea&s;es, in que&s;t of fortune and happine&s;s&mdash;to re&s;trict him from exerci&s;ing, <HI>in a foreign country, and in a fo|reign &s;ervice,</HI> his genius, talents and indu&s;try; to de|nounce

him for &s;eeking honor, emolument or in&s;truc|tion, by enli&s;ting <HI>within the territory and under the banners</HI> of another nation;&mdash;to do &s;uch things, is to condemn the principle of our own policy, by which we invite all the world to fill up the population of our country: To do &s;uch things is, in fact, to pro&s;trate the boa&s;ted rights of man. It it hardly worth a pau&s;e to a&s;k, <HI>what proportion of respect is due to the commi&s;&s;ion of a Briti&s;h officer?</HI> and <HI>what degree of puni&s;hment</HI> the refu&s;al or neglect to pay it, may de&s;erve?</P>
<P N="6">(6.) <HI>By the con&s;titution</HI> it is declared, that "no tax or duty &s;hall be laid <HI>on articles exported from any &s;tate."</HI></P>
<P><HI>By the treaty</HI> "it is expre&s;sly agreed and declared that the United States will prohibit and re&s;train the carrying any mela&s;&s;es, &s;ugar, coffee, cocoa, or cotton, in American ve&s;&s;els, either from his maje&s;ty's i&s;lands, <HI>or from the United States,</HI> to any part of the world."</P>
<P><HI>Remarks.</HI> This is an extract, it is true, from the twelfth article of the treaty; but it equally &s;erves to &s;how the probability of attempts to violate the con&s;ti|tution. Be&s;ides, the advocates for the treaty are ha|&s;ty and premature, when they de&s;ire to throw the twelfth article entirely out of con&s;ideration: fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, by that propo&s;ition, <HI>though they &s;hould &s;ave the treaty, they effectually de&s;troy its author.</HI> They are ha&s;ty and pre|mature for another rea&s;on: the twelfth article is to be <HI>&s;u&s;pended for the declared purpo&s;e of negociating &s;omething as a &s;ub&s;titute;</HI> and, therefore we mu&s;t confider its principle, in order to a&s;certain, how far <HI>any modification</HI> of it could be rendered palatable. But, <HI>on con&s;tituti|onal ground,</HI> when it is declared, that <HI>no duty</HI> &s;hall <HI>by law</HI> be laid on articles exported from any &s;tate, is it not ab&s;urd, or wicked to &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>by treaty</HI> the exportation of <HI>the articles them&s;elves</HI> can be prohibited? The obvious intention of <HI>the con&s;titution</HI> is to encou|rage <HI>our export trade;</HI>&mdash;the immediate effect of <HI>the treaty</HI> is to ob&s;truct and annihilate it.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) There are many other points in which <HI>a colli&s;ion occurs between the con&s;titution and the treaty,</HI> but to which
<PB N="132" REF="029752_0137_0FE25418C74F6DF0">
the &s;cope and nature of the&s;e &s;trictures wil not admit a full attention.

If a part of the United States may be ceded&mdash;if a whole &s;tate may be ceded, what becomes of the guarantee of a republican form of government to every &s;tate? The propriety of pre&s;enting this con&s;ideration to the pub|lic mind, will be allowed by tho&s;e who know, that, <HI>in the cour&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;enatorial debate, the RIGHT of CED|ING BY TREATY a WHOLE &s;tate, nay, ANY NUMBER of the &s;tates, &s;hort of a majority, was BOLDLY ASSERTED, and STRENUOUSLY ARGUED!!!</HI></P>
<P N="8">(8.) It may not be ami&s;s, likewi&s;e, to add, that our government has no more right to <HI>alienate powers that are given,</HI> that it has to <HI>u&s;urp powers that are not given.</HI> For instance, <HI>an act of congre&s;s</HI> could not (and <HI>can a treaty?</HI>) &s;urrender the right of &s;eque&s;tering the property of a ho&s;tile nation&mdash;the right of giving com|mercial preferences to a friendly nation&mdash;and the right of &s;u&s;pending a ruinous intercour&s;e with any nation?

<P>But why &s;hould we arbitrarily <HI>abu&s;e,</HI> in&s;tead of en|deavouring rationally to <HI>convince</HI> each other? We all have the &s;ame right, from natural and from &s;ocial law, <HI>to think and to &s;peak:</HI> it is true, that we do not all po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame powers of rea&s;on, nor the &s;ame charms of eloquence; but when men are on <HI>an equality in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> as well as in <HI>the right of exerci&s;ing,</HI> tho&s;e en|dowments, there can be no amicable way of adju&s;ting a difference of opinion, but that which is adopted for adju&s;ting all the other differences of a free people&mdash;<HI>an appeal to the voice of the majority!</HI> Now, let it be allowed (and &s;o far ought to be allowed, but no far|ther) that Mr. Jay, who negociated the treaty; the twenty members of the &s;enate, who a&s;&s;ented to a con|ditional ratification; and Mr. Hamilton, and the New York chamber of commerce, who have appeared in &s;upport of it (an enumeration that compri&s;es, it is believed, all that have hitherto <HI>avowed a perfect appro|bation</HI>) are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of as great a portion of information, integrity and talents, as <HI>a like number</HI> of citizens, &s;elected for their approved wi&s;dom, virtue and patrioti&s;m, from the aggregate of tho&s;e who have

<P>But let the pardon of the reader be granted for <HI>this digre&s;&s;ion;</HI> and we will return to a delineation of the feature that lies before us.</P>
<P N="12">12.

<P>Our government, therefore, being <HI>a government of departments,</HI> it is (as we have already ob&s;erved) incon|&s;i&s;tent with <HI>the duty of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation;</HI> or, in other words, it mu&s;t proceed from <HI>an error in con&s;truction;</HI> that <HI>one</HI> department &s;hall a&s;&s;ume and exerci&s;e all, or

any, of the powers, of all, or any, of the other depart|ments. "The departments of government (to adopt the elegant figure u&s;ed by an excellent judge in a late admirable charge to a Philadelphia jury) are planets that revolve, each in its appropriate orbit, round the con&s;titution, as the fun of our political &s;y&s;|tem." Thus, if the legi&s;lative, executive, or judicial departments &s;hall encroach, one upon the orbit of the other, the de&s;truction of the order, u&s;e, and beauty of the political &s;y&s;tem, mu&s;t as inevitably en&s;ue, as the de&s;truction of the order, u&s;e and beauty of the planetary &s;y&s;tem would follow, from a &s;ubver|&s;ion of the e&s;&s;ential principles of attraction, repul&s;ion and gravity.</P>
<P N="13">13. It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, that the power of making treaties with foreign nations, &s;hould be ve&s;ted in one of the departments of the government: but <HI>the power of making treaties is not, in its nature, paramount to every other power; not does the exerci&s;e of that pow|er naturally demand an exclu&s;ive juri&s;diction.</HI> A nation may carry on its <HI>external commerce</HI> without the aid of <HI>the treaty-making p&oacute;wer;</HI> but it cannot manage its <HI>do|me&s;tic concerns</HI> without the aid of the <HI>legi&s;lative power:</HI> the legi&s;lative power is, con&s;equently, of &s;uperior im|portance and rank to the treaty-making power. A|gain:&mdash;<HI>The legi&s;lative power, exerci&s;ed conformably to the con&s;titution,</HI> mu&s;t be direct, univer&s;al, and conclu&s;ive in its operation and force upon the people; but <HI>the treaty-making power</HI> is &s;carcely in any in&s;tance inde|pendent of legi&s;lative aid to effectuate its efforts, and to render its compacts obligatory on the nation. A memorable occurrence in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory will &s;erve to illu&s;trate both of the&s;e po&s;itions: It is the fate of <HI>the commercial part of the famous treaty of Utrecht,</HI> con|cluded between France and England in the year 1712. "The peace (&s;ays Ru&s;&s;el in his "hi&s;tory of modern Europe," vol. 4. P. 457) was generally di&s;liked by the people, <HI>and all impartial men reprobated the treaty of

It was accordingly urged, when a bill was brought into the hou&s;e of commons for con|firming them, that the trade with Portugal, the mo&s;t beneficial of any, would be lo&s;t, &s;hould the duties on French and Portugue&s;e wines be made equal, &amp;c. &amp;c. The&s;e and &s;imilar arguments <HI>induced the more moderate tories to join the whigs, AND THE BILL WAS REJECTED BY A MaJORITY OF NINE VOTES."</HI> In relating the &s;ame tran&s;action, Smollet's hi&s;tory of England (vol. 2. p. 242, 246) contains &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages too remarkable to be omitted on the pre&s;ent occation. "Again&s;t the 8th and 9th articles (&s;ays the hi&s;torian) <HI>the Portugue&s;e mini&s;ter pre&s;ented a memorial,</HI> declaring, that &s;hould the duties on French wines be lowered to the &s;ame level with tho&s;e that were laid on the wines of Portugal, <HI>his ma&s;ter would renew the prohibition of the woolen ma|nufactures, and other products of Great Britain. Indeed, all the trading part of the nation exclaimed again&s;t the treaty of commerce, which &s;eems to have been concluded in a hurry, before the mini&s;ters fully under&s;tood the nature of the &s;ubject.</HI> This precipitation was owing to the fears that their endeavours after peace would mi&s;carry, from the intrigues of the whig faction, and the ob&s;ti|nate oppo&s;ition of the confederates." "Another bill (continues the &s;ame writer, in a &s;ub&s;equent page) being brought into the hou&s;e of commons, for ren|dering the treaty of commerce effectual, <HI>&s;uch a number of petitions were delivered again&s;t it,</HI> and &s;o many &s;olid arguments advanced by the merchants, who were ex|amined on the &s;ubject, that <HI>even a great number of tory

<P>Perhaps there cannot, in the annals of all the na|tions of the earth, be found two ca&s;es more parallel than the one which is thus recorded in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, and the one which at pre&s;ent agitates the American <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation.&mdash;1. All impartial men reprobated both treaties as &s;oon as the terms were known. 2. The admi&s;&s;ion of the oppo&s;ite contracting party to an unqualified participation in trade, with the mo&s;t favored nation, is, in both ca&s;es, a principal &s;ource of complaint. 3. The removal of all prohibitions, and the &s;urrender of the right to impo&s;e higher duties on the commodities of the oppo&s;ite contracting party, than on tho&s;e of any other people, are, in both ca&s;es, condemned. 4. The good and the intelligent of all parties have united their influence, in both ca&s;es, to prevent a confirmation of articles of &s;o ruinous a ten|dency. 5. The whole nation, in both ca&s;es, have ex|claimed again&s;t the treaty. 6. Both treaties were con|cluded in a hurry, before the mini&s;ters fully under|&s;tood the nature of the &s;ubject. 7. Innumerable peti|tions (and who will NOW deny the propriety of ex|erci&s;ing the American right to petition?) were deli|vered again&s;t both treaties. 8. And the Portugue&s;e mini&s;ter declared in effect, of the treaty of Utrecht (<HI>mutatis mutandis</HI>) what the mini&s;ter of France will, probably, declare of the treaty of London (but what America &s;urrenders the right of &s;aying at any time to Great Britain) "If you ratify your alliance with the British, you mu&s;t &s;urrender your alliance with France." If &s;uch a wonderful &s;imilarily of circum&s;tances con|cur <HI>in the negociation, terms, and reception</HI> of the&s;e me|morable in&s;truments, let us hope that the guardian an|gel of American liberty and pro&s;perity, has, al&s;o, doom|ed them finally to experience a <HI>merited &s;imilarity of fate!</HI></P>

nor exclu&s;ive</HI> (though <HI>the generality</HI> of judge Black|&s;tone's expre&s;&s;ions on the &s;ubject would, perhaps, lead to that prepo&s;terous conclu&s;ion) we might be &s;atisfied to pre&s;ume, on general principles, that &s;o high a claim of juri&s;diction could not be maintained, at lea&s;t, on the part of our pre&s;ident and &s;enate. Yet, let us endeavour, by the infallible te&s;t of the con&s;titution, to put the matter, if po&s;&s;ible, beyond doubt and con|trover&s;y; and having e&s;tabli&s;hed that each department of the government &s;hould be confined to its proper orbit, let us endearour to a&s;certain, what that orbit is, in relation to the <HI>treaty-making power.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) The power of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate to make treaties, is given (as we have already &s;tated) <HI>in general and unre&s;tricted terms.</HI></P>
<P>But the powers given to congre&s;s (except in an in|&s;tance to be hereafter noticed) <HI>are definite in their terms, and appropriated in their objects.</HI></P>
<P>Let us a&s;k, then, by what rule of con&s;truction a power <HI>primarily and &s;pecifically</HI> given to one body, can be a&s;&s;umed and exerci&s;ed by another, to which, <HI>in a &s;ub&s;equent clau&s;e,</HI> a mere <HI>general</HI> authority is given?</P>
<P>Upon the common law principles of con&s;truction, <HI>the &s;pecific powers</HI> would clearly, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, be deemed a re&s;ervation and exception out of <HI>the general grant.</HI> But even according to a rule furni&s;hed by the con&s;titution it&s;elf, the &s;ame re&s;ult will be produced. Thus, the twelfth ratified amendment declares, "that the powers not delegated to the United States by the con&s;titution, are re&s;erved to the &s;tates re&s;pectively, or to the people." Now, if the general power granted for the purpo&s;e of making treaties, can &s;et at nought the juri&s;diction &s;pecifically given to congre&s;s for the purpo&s;e of making laws, may it not, with equal pro|priety and effect, overleap the boundary thus inter|po&s;ed between popular rights and con&s;tituted powers? In the one ca&s;e, the re&s;ervation is expre&s;sly declared&mdash;in the other, it is nece&s;&s;arily implied.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="141" REF="029752_0146_0FE2543C63E70A40">(2.) But if the delegation of <HI>a general power</HI> does, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> convey a right to embrace, in the exerci&s;e of that power, every authority not incompatible with its objects, the con&s;equence will be that <HI>congre&s;s may enter into treaties as well as the pre&s;ident and &s;enate.</HI></P>
<P>For, congre&s;s is ve&s;ted with a juri&s;diction "to make all laws, which &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary and proper for car|rying into execution their own powers:" and what laws are, in that re&s;pect, nece&s;&s;ary and proper, they mu&s;t, from the nature of the thing, be the judge.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, therefore, that congre&s;s was de&s;irous of forming <HI>an alliance, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, with France,</HI> but could not obtain the con&s;titutional number of two-thirds of the &s;enate for accompli&s;hing the mea&s;ure <HI>by treaty,&mdash;an act of congre&s;s in order to regulate com|merce with that nation,</HI> would afford as effectual a mode (according to the new doctrine) &s;ince the act, on the pretext of an equivalent for commercial advantages, might <HI>legi&s;late</HI> us into the coveted alliance. The temptation and facility of proceeding in this way is obvious;&mdash;the pa&s;&s;ing of a law requiring but a majo|rity of the &s;enate; whereas the ratification of a treaty requires the concurrence of two-thirds of the members of that body.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) It is not, however, nece&s;&s;ary to mingle and confu&s;e the departments of our government, contrary to the fir&s;t principles of a free republic; not to make <HI>a part</HI> of our political &s;y&s;tem <HI>equal to the whole,</HI> con|trary to the &s;ounde&s;t axioms of demon&s;trative philo&s;o|phy, in order to give a ju&s;t, efficient and &s;alutary effect to the treaty-making power of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate. For although,</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, the <HI>treaty-making</HI> power cannot bind the nation by <HI>a deci&s;ion</HI> upon any of the &s;ubjects, which the con&s;titution expre&s;sly devolves upon the <HI>legi&s;lative power:</HI></P>
<P>Yet, in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, the treaty-making power may <HI>negociate conditionally,</HI> re&s;pecting the &s;ubjects that
<PB N="142" REF="029752_0147_0FE2543DF5A9B390">
con&s;titutionally belong to <HI>the deci&s;ion of the legi&s;lative power:</HI></P>
<P>And, in the <HI>third</HI> place, <HI>every other &s;ubject,</HI> proper for the national compact of a republic, may be <HI>nego|ciated and ab&s;olutely concluded by the treaty-making power.</HI></P>
<P N="4">(4.) That &s;uch a di&s;tinction was intended by the framers of our pre&s;ent excellent con&s;titution, the rea|&s;ons that have been glanced at, mu&s;t, it is thought, &s;ufficiently prove to every ingenuous mind: But let one argument more be adduced.</P>
<P>By the ninth article of the old confederation it was declared, "That the United States, in congre&s;s a&s;|&s;embled, &s;hall have <HI>the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right and power of determining on peace and war."</HI></P>
<P>By the exi&s;ting con&s;titution of the United States, it is provided, "That congre&s;s &s;hall have power <HI>to de|clare war,</HI> grant letters of marque and repri&s;al, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now, it it evident, that by omitting to depo&s;it <HI>with congre&s;s</HI> the power of <HI>making peace,</HI> in addition to the power of <HI>declaring war,</HI> the framers of our pre|&s;ent government, had in full view the divi&s;ion of its departments, and the corre&s;ponding di&s;tribution of its powers.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, <HI>under the confederation,</HI> was a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> body, and therefore, nece&s;&s;arily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the little le|gi&s;lative, executive, and judicial authority, which <HI>the &s;tates</HI> had been plea&s;ed to delegate <HI>to the union.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The government of the United States,</HI> on the contrary, is a compound &s;y&s;tem, of which the congre&s;s is only <HI>the legi&s;lative department:</HI> and, therefore, the executive and judicial functions are el&s;ewhere to be &s;ought for and exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that although the power of <HI>declaring war is</HI> (as it ought to be) <HI>left with congre&s;s,</HI> the pow|er of <HI>making peace is</HI> (as it ought to be) <HI>transferred to the executive;</HI> being a natural appendage of the gene|ral power of <HI>making treaties.</HI></P>
<P>This deduction &s;erves likewi&s;e to demon&s;trate, that the framers of the con&s;titution, did not intend to
<PB N="143" REF="029752_0148_0FE254492156F538">
leave the powers that are <HI>&s;pecifically</HI> given to con|gre&s;s, at the mercy of the power that is <HI>generally</HI> giv|en to the pre&s;ident and &s;enate. By expre&s;&s;ing a po&s;i|tive juri&s;diction in favor of the former, it excludes a claim of juri&s;diction in favor of the latter.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) Nor is it in <HI>the power of making treatie&s; only,</HI> that the con&s;titution has abridged <HI>the executive depart|ment</HI> of its cu&s;tomary attributes, in order to augment the &s;ources of <HI>legi&s;lative juri&s;diction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In Great Britain</HI> (for in&s;tance) <HI>the executive</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|es the power of making peace; of granting letters of marque and repri&s;al; of regulating weights and mea|&s;ures; of coining money, regulating the value there|of, and of foreign coins; of erecting courts of judica|ture; of conferring the rights of deni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en&s;hip on ali|ens, &amp;c. &amp;c</P>
<P><HI>In the United States</HI> the power for all tho&s;e purpo&s;es is ab&s;olutely ve&s;ted <HI>in the legi&s;lature.</HI></P>

<P N="1">(1.) It has been &s;aid, that <HI>the power of regulating commerce belonged to congre&s;s.</HI></P>

This bu&s;ine&s;s was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed [in the convention] at Philadelphia for four months; during which time the &s;ubject of commerce and navigation was often under con&s;ideration; and, I a&s;&s;ert, <HI>that eight out of twelve, for more than three months, voted for requir|ing two-thirds of the members pre&s;ent in each hou&s;e to pa&s;s commercial and navigation laws.</HI> True it is, that
<PB N="144" REF="029752_0149_0FE2544AB0A73728">
afterwards it was carried by a majority as it &s;tands. If I am right, <HI>there was a great majority for two-thirds of the &s;tates in this bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> till a compromi&s;e took place between the northern and &s;outhern &s;tates; the northern &s;tates agreeing to the temporary im|portation of &s;laves; and the fouthern &s;tates conced|ing, in return, that <HI>navigation and commercial laws &s;hould be on the &s;ooting on which they now &s;tand.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>It has been &s;aid, that</HI> the treaty-making power could not cede a part of the union, nor &s;urrender a citizen to be puni&s;hed as a pirate.</P>
<P>The opinion of Mr. Randolph (a member of the federal convention, and now &s;ecretary of &s;tate) deli|vered in the &s;ame convention, contains the following pa&s;&s;age: <Q>I conceive, that <HI>neither the life, nor the property of any citizen, nor the particular right of any &s;tate, can be affected by a treaty.</HI></Q></P>

<P>They have ve&s;ted in one &s;upreme court, and in &s;uch inferior courts as the congre&s;s &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h, the <HI>judicial</HI> power of the United States.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, that, in congre&s;s, the <HI>whole</HI> legi&s;lative power of the United States is not ve&s;ted: an important part of that power was exer|ci&s;ed by the people them&s;elves, when they ordain|ed and e&s;tabli&s;hed the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>This con&s;titution is the &s;upreme law of the land: This &s;upreme law, all judicial officers of the United States are bound, by oath or affirmation, to &s;upport.</P>
<P>It is a principle important to freedom, that in government, the <HI>judicial</HI> &s;hould be di&s;tinct from, and independent of, the legi&s;lative department. To this important principle the people of the United States, in forming their con&s;titution, have manife&s;t|ed the highe&s;t regard.</P>
<P>They have placed their <HI>judicial</HI> power, not in congre&s;s, but <HI>in "courts."</HI> They have ordained, that <HI>"the judges"</HI> of tho&s;e courts &s;hall hold their offices "during good behaviour;" and that, dur|ing their continuance in office, their &s;alaries &s;hall not be dimini&s;hed.</P>

<P N="3">3. The refu&s;al to enter into the projected treaty with Great Britain, is <HI>not a ju&s;t cau&s;e of war;</HI> and and if a <HI>pretence,</HI> only, is wanting, it may be found in the toa&s;ts at our fe&s;tivals, as well as in the acts of our government.</P>
<P N="4">4. But the ratification of the treaty will a&s;&s;uredly give umbrage to <HI>another nation</HI>&mdash;to an ancient ally.</P>
<P N="5">5. If war is inevitable <HI>either with great Britain, or with France,</HI> it would be more politic for the &s;tate, more congenial to the &s;entiments of the people, to en|gage the former, than the latter, power.</P>
<P N="6">6. In ca&s;e of a war with Great Britain, we have a&s;&s;urance, <HI>that France will aid us with all the energy of her triumphant arms.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. In ca&s;e of a war with France, we ought not to count upon <HI>the affections,</HI> and we cannot rely upon the power, of Great Britain, to befriend us.</P>

<HEAD>RESOLUTIONS Of the Citizens of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> at a Meeting legally conven|ed by the &s;electmen, on the 13th of July, <HI>1795,</HI> re&s;|pecting the Treaty lately concluded between Lord Gren|ville and Mr. Jay.</HEAD>
<P>RESOLVED, as the &s;en&s;e of the inhabitants of this town&mdash;That the afore&s;aid in&s;trument, if ra|tified, will be highly injurious to the commercial inte|re&s;ts of the United States, derogatory to their nati|onal honor and independence, and may be dangerous to the peace and happine&s;s of their citizens.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons which have induced this opinion are as follow, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e this compact pro&s;e&s;&s;es to have no refer|ence to the merits of the complaints and preten&s;ious of the contracting parties: but in reality the com|plaints and preten&s;ions of Great Britain are fully pro|vided for, while a part only of tho&s;e of the United States have been brought into con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e, in the &s;tipulation which &s;urrenders <HI>our</HI> po&s;ts on the we&s;tern frontier, no provi&s;ion is made to indemnify the United States for the commercial and other lo&s;&s;es they have &s;u&s;tained, and the heavy ex|pen&s;es to which they have been &s;ubjected in con&s;e|quence of being kept out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, for twelve years, in direct violation of the treaty of peace.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e no indemnification is to be made to the citizens of the United States, for property taken from them at the clo&s;e of the war, the re&s;titution of which is provided for in the &s;ame treaty.</P>
<P N="4">4. Becau&s;e the capture of ve&s;&s;els and property of the citizens of the United States, made under the au|thority of the government of Great Britain, is a na|tional concern, and claims ari&s;ing from &s;uch captures ought not to have been &s;ubmitted to the deci&s;ion of their admiralty courts, as the United States are there|by
<PB N="157" REF="029752_0162_0FE25478987EE3A8">
precluded from having a voice in the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">al deter|mination of &s;uch ca&s;es.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e the indemnification propo&s;ed to be made, is to be &s;ought by a proce&s;s, tedious and ex|pen&s;ive, in which ju&s;tice may be delayed to an unrea|&s;onable time; and eventually lo&s;t to many of the &s;uf|ferers, from their inability to pur&s;ue it; and becau&s;e this mode of indemnification bears no proportion to the &s;ummary method adopted for the &s;atisfaction of Briti&s;h claims.</P>
<P N="5">5. Becau&s;e this compact admits Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to an equal participation with our own citizens, of the interior traffic of the United States with the neigh|bouring Indians, through our whole territorial domi|nions; while the advantages o&s;ten&s;ibly reciprocated to our citizens, are limited both in their nature and ex|tent.</P>
<P N="6">6. Becau&s;e the alien duty upon merchandi&s;e im|ported into the United States by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, in their own bottoms, is, if not wholly &s;u&s;pended, at lea&s;t contracted not to be increa&s;ed.</P>
<P N="7">7. Becau&s;e the commerce we have hitherto enjoy|ed in India, in common with other nations, is &s;o re|&s;tricted, that in future it will be of little or no &s;ub|&s;tantial benefit to our citizens.</P>
<P N="8">8. Becau&s;e in every stipulation re&s;pecting our inter|cour&s;e with the colonial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Great Britain, the whole commerce of the United States, in &s;uch in|tercour&s;e, is <HI>colonized</HI> in return.</P>
<P N="9">9. Becau&s;e the clau&s;e by which the Briti&s;h govern|ment re&s;erves to it&s;elf the right of impo&s;ing on Ame|rican ve&s;&s;els, entering Briti&s;h ports in Europe, a duty which &s;hall countervail the difference of the duty payable on the importation of European and A&s;iatic goods into the United States in Briti&s;h or Ameri|can bottoms, places it in the power of that govern|ment to enable Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to become the import|ers of A&s;iatic and European goods into the United States, to the exclu&s;ion of our own citizens.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="158" REF="029752_0163_0FE2547A281E5ED8">10. Becau&s;e although the terms of &s;aid treaty pur|port to be reciprocal in many in&s;tances, yet from the local &s;ituation, and exi&s;ting circum&s;tances of the Unit|ed States, and the pacific &s;y&s;tem of policy they have adopted, that reciprocity is merely nominal and de|lu&s;ive.</P>
<P N="11">11. Becau&s;e it prevents the United States from impo&s;ing any further re&s;trictions on the Briti&s;h trade <HI>alone.</HI></P>
<P>And, becau&s;e it is &s;tipulated that neither the debts due from individuals of one nation to individuals of the other, nor &s;hares nor monies which they may have in the public funds, or in any public or private banks, &s;hall ever in any event of war or national differences, be &s;eque&s;tered or confi&s;cated.&mdash;It is far from being impo&s;&s;ible that the exerci&s;e of this right may in the opinion of the national legi&s;lature contribute to pre|&s;erve the peace of our country, and protect the rights and property of the citizens from violation, we there|fore e&s;teem it highly impolitic that the public faith &s;hould be pledged that it &s;hall never be exerci&s;ed un|der any circum&s;tances whatever.</P>
<P N="12">12. Becau&s;e it concedes a right to the Briti&s;h go|vernment to &s;earch and detain our ve&s;&s;els in time of war, under frivolous and vexatious pretexts.</P>
<P N="13">13. Becau&s;e it agrees, that &s;hip-timber, tar, hemp, &s;ails and copper, &s;hall be con&s;idered contraband of war, which articles are expre&s;sly &s;tipulated to be free by the treaties already &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the United States and all other nations, with whom they are in compact.</P>
<P N="14">14. Becau&s;e it &s;urrenders all or mo&s;t of the bene|fits of a commercial nature, which we had a right to expect from our neutrality in the pre&s;ent war.</P>
<P N="15">15. Becau&s;e it precludes the hope of receiving a|ny advantage from the modern law of nations, refer|red to in the pre&s;ident's proclamation of neutrality; adopted by mo&s;t of the nations of Europe, in the la&s;t
<PB N="159" REF="029752_0164_0FE25482310BF820">
war, and which we then acceded to and have &s;ecuted in our treaties with all other nations.</P>
<P N="16">16. Becau&s;e it not only &s;urrenders the right of carrying the property of any nation at war with Great Britain, in our ve&s;&s;els, freely; but abandons all preten|&s;ions even to the freight.</P>
<P N="17">17. Becau&s;e it permits the Briti&s;h nation to con|vert provi&s;ions, de&s;tined to other nations at war with them, to their own u&s;e, on payment of what they may deem rea&s;onable profit&mdash;a mea&s;ure, not only in|jurious to the intere&s;t of the American merchant, but which will prevent our citizens from carrying tho&s;e &s;upplies to other countries, which, by the laws of na|ture and nations, they have a right to do, without mole&s;tation.</P>
<P N="18">18. Becau&s;e it limits the power of congre&s;s, de|legated to them by the con&s;titution, "to regulate our commerce with foreign nations," by pre&s;cribing conditions, and creating impediments to the exerci&s;e of that "power."</P>
<P N="19">19. Becau&s;e it expo&s;es the United States and their commerce to &s;imilar embarra&s;&s;ments from other com|mercial nations, all of whom will probably regulate our trade by this partial &s;tandard.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly&mdash;</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, in the opinion of the inhabitants of this town, the nature and extent of the exports of the U|nited States are &s;uch, that in all their &s;tipulations with foreign nations they have it in their power to &s;ecure a perfect reciprocity of intercour&s;e, not only with the home dominions of &s;uch nations, but with all their colonial dependencies.</P>
<P>It is further re&s;olved&mdash;That a copy of the forego|ing proceedings, atte&s;ted by the town-clerk, be imme|diately tran&s;mitted to the pre&s;ident of the United States, that they may be re&s;pectfully &s;ubmitted to his con&s;ideration. And we earne&s;tly hope, and confi|dently rely, that his prudence, fortitude and wi&s;dom, which have more than once been eminently in&s;trument|al

in the &s;alvation of his country, will be equally con|&s;picuous on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; and that the rea|&s;ons we have a&s;&s;igned will have their influence to in|duce him to withhold his &s;ignature from the ratifica|tion of this alarming in&s;trument.</P>
<P>On motion of Mr. Au&s;tin, a vote of thanks was pa&s;&s;ed to Stephens Thomp&s;on Ma&s;on, one of the &s;e|nators for Virginia, for his patrioti&s;m, in publi&s;hing the treaty, which had afforded the town an opportu|nity of u&s;ing their exertions in endeavouring to pre|vent the ratification of an in&s;trument &s;o evidently per|nicious to the intere&s;ts of our nation at large.</P>

<HEAD>ADDRESS Of the Citizens of <HI>Port&s;mouth (New Hamp&s;hire)</HI> agreed upon at a Meeting held the 17th of July, <HI>1795.</HI> TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, Pre&s;ident of the United States of America.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CONVINCED of your inviolable attachment to the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of the &s;tates over which you pre&s;ide, and your readine&s;s on all occa&s;ions to attend to the ju&s;t complaints of the people&mdash;We, the citizens of Port&s;mouth, con&s;titutionally a&s;&s;embled in public town meeting, to &s;ignify our opinions rela|tive to the treaty between Great Britain and the U|nited States of America, con&s;ented to by a majority of the &s;enate, and recommended for your ratification, having taken the &s;ame into our mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ider|ation, beg leave to expre&s;s our mo&s;t hearty di&s;appro|bation thereof&mdash;for the following general rea&s;ons, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e that part of the treaty of 1783, &s;ecur|ing the payment of debts due to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, is rigorou&s;ly enforced; while an important article in the
<PB N="161" REF="029752_0166_0FE2548676F369D0">&s;ame treaty, requiring compen&s;ation for negroes and other property unju&s;tly removed, is placed wholly out of view.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e the 9th article confers a privilege on Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, which, though expre&s;&s;ed in terms re|ciprocal, yet from the different circum&s;tances of the two nations, not only wants an equivalent, but is a direct inva&s;ion of the rights of individual &s;tates.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e the bonds required of commanders of privateers, are wholly inadequate to the purpo&s;es for which &s;uch provi&s;ion was made.</P>
<P N="4">4. Becau&s;e the regulations of trade, commerce and navigation, between the two parties, contained in the 3d, 13th, 15th and 17th articles, hold out the mo&s;t decided advantages to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and mu&s;t in their operation prove de&s;tructive to American com|merce and navigation.</P>
<P N="5">5. Becau&s;e by the 18th article, many articles of export are admitted as contraband of war, which, by our treaties with France, Holland and Sweden, are declared free; by which means a di&s;po&s;ition to aid the Briti&s;h in the de&s;truction of the natives of tho&s;e nati|ons is fairly implied.</P>
<P N="6">6. Becau&s;e all the e&s;&s;ential advantages re&s;ulting to the United States from a ratification of the treaty are &s;uch as they have a right to demand either by virtue of the treaty of 1783, or from the principles of com|mon ju&s;tice, while many important privileges are al|lowed the Briti&s;h, without a counter part.</P>
<P>Thus, &s;ir, we have &s;tated a few of the many objec|tions that might be oppo&s;ed to the treaty; we forbear entering into a more particular detail, as it would pro|bably be a repetition of tho&s;e, which we pre&s;ume mu&s;t flow in to you from every quarter, as the guar|dian and protector of our rights and liberties, and who alone in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance can avert the many evils that threaten our ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="029752_0167_0FE254880B88BE58">We therefore mo&s;t fervently reque&s;t, that the trea|ty between Great Britain and the United States, may not receive your ratification until it undergo &s;uch al|terations as &s;hall render it conducive to the intere&s;t, honour and la&s;ting peace of our country.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="resolutions">
<HEAD>RESOLUTIONS Of the Citizens of <HI>New York,</HI> agreed upon at a Meeting held on Monday the 20th of July, <HI>1795.</HI></HEAD>
<P>RESOLVED, as the &s;en&s;e of this meeting, That the treaty lately negociated between this coun|try and Great Britain, in the particulars herein after mentioned, is injurious to the agriculture, manufac|tures, and commerce of the United States, derogato|ry from their national honor, and dangerous to their welfare, peace, and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P N="1">1. In terminating the differences between the two countries, without reference to the merits of their re&s;|pective complaints and preten&s;ions, the vague and ill-founded claims of Great Britain are placed upon the &s;ame footing as the numerous, important, and ju&s;t de|mands of the United States: and while the former, un&s;upported as they were, are amply provided for, many of the latter are either entirely overlooked, or placed upon a footing, from which no adequate re|dre&s;s or compen&s;ation can rea&s;onably be expected.</P>
<P N="2">2. As his Britannic maje&s;ty is bound by the treaty of peace to withdraw his garri&s;ons from the United States with all convenient &s;peed, it was unju&s;t, after twelve years delay, to allow above eighteen months longer to complete an evacuation which might be car|ried into effect in a few weeks.</P>
<P N="3">3. As no enumeration is made of the po&s;ts and places from which the Briti&s;h troops are to be with|drawn, but generally from the boundary lines a&s;&s;ign|ed
<PB N="163" REF="029752_0168_0FE254919F783A88">
by the treaty of peace; and as it appears by the &s;ame in&s;trument that the&s;e boundary lines are, in part, at lea&s;t, to be adju&s;ted hereafter, it is highly probable if &s;uch adju&s;tment does not take place by June, 1796, that it will be made an excu&s;e for detaining the po&s;ts yet longer. Be&s;ides, by placing at &s;o great a di&s;tance the contemplated evacuation, it is al&s;o much to be feared, that an immediate peace in Europe will induce Great Britain to di&s;regard this &s;tipulation altogether.</P>
<P N="4">4. All &s;ettlers and traders within the precincts or juri&s;dictions of the&s;e po&s;ts, may remain there, or re|move with their effects; they cannot, however, be compelled to become citizens of, or to take the oath of allegiance to the United States; but they may do so if they think proper, and they &s;hall make and de|clare their election within one year after the evacuati|on. And all per&s;ons who continue there after the ex|piration of a year without having declared their inten|tion of remaining &s;ubjects of his Britannic maje&s;ty, &s;hall be con&s;idered as having elected to become citi|zens of the United States. Hence it appears, that all the &s;ettlers, if they arrive but the day before the evacuation, will be entitled to become American citi|zens, contrary to the act now in force re&s;pecting na|turalization, and contrary to the con&s;titution of the United States, under which that act was pa&s;&s;ed; or if they prefer to continue under their pre&s;ent allegiance, we may have a Briti&s;h colony in the heart of our country.</P>
<P N="5">5. Although his Britannic maje&s;ty agrees to &s;ur|render the po&s;ts within our boundary lines, no provi|&s;ion is made for the heavy lo&s;&s;es and expen&s;es which have been incurred by the United States in con&s;e|quence of their pa&s;t detention. Among the former, may be included a long deprivation of an exten&s;ive and valuable territory, and of a lucrative branch of trade. Among the latter, the burdens which have been im|po&s;ed upon our citizens to &s;upport a ruinous and ex|pen&s;ive Indian war&mdash;to &s;ay nothing of the lives which
<PB N="164" REF="029752_0169_0FE25493B20B95A0">
this detention has co&s;t the United States of America.</P>
<P N="6">6. By the treaty of peace, Great Britain was to cau&s;e no de&s;truction, nor to carry away any negroes, or other American property. In direct violation of this promi&s;e, &s;everal thou&s;and negroes were carried off long after the treaty was known. Many of tho&s;e ne|groes were regi&s;tered with a view to future compen&s;a|tion. The claim, on this account, which amounted to at lea&s;t two millions of dollars, although hitherto a matter of extreme &s;olicitude with America, has not only been abandoned and con&s;igned to oblivion, but Great Britain is thereby ju&s;tified for her inexecution of the treaty of peace, and an indelible &s;tain is fixed upon our national faith; nor is any provi&s;ion made for leaving in tho&s;e garri&s;ons, the American artillery, a|greeable to the treaty of peace.</P>
<P N="7">7. Many of our &s;eamen have, during the pre&s;ent war, been impre&s;&s;ed into the Engli&s;h &s;ervice, and compelled to engage on board of &s;hips of war or pri|vateers, again&s;t a nation connected with us by a treaty of alliance. Although this grievance was univer&s;ally known and reprobated, the aggre&s;&s;ion is pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence, nor is even care taken to guard again&s;t the repetition of &s;o atrocious an outrage.</P>
<P N="8">8. While the &s;ubjects of Great Britain are admit|ted into, and have the u&s;e of <HI>all</HI> the rivers, ports, and places within the United States, our citizens are ex|cluded from a reciprocal u&s;e of tho&s;e within the Bri|ti&s;h territories in North America, by rea&s;on of which inequality, it is probable, the whole of the for trade will continue in the hands of Briti&s;h traders.</P>
<P N="9">9. No duty is ever to be laid by either party on peltries brought by land or inland navigation. From this article Great Britain alone will derive an advan|tage; for, as the clau&s;e which regulates the interior traffic and inland navigation of this country is con|&s;tructed, and taking into con&s;ideration the nature and extent of the limitations on the &s;ide of America, it may be expected that con&s;iderable quantities of this
<PB N="165" REF="029752_0170_0FE2549548353240">
article will be carried by Briti&s;h traders through the United States, while little, if any, will be carried by our citizens through the Briti&s;h territory.</P>
<P N="10">10. As it appears from the corre&s;pondence between Mr. Jeffer&s;on and Mr. Hammond, that no lawful im|pediments exi&s;t in any &s;tate, to the recovery of Bri|ti&s;h debts contracted before the peace; it was not only improper, but a reflection on our public faith, to make any provi&s;ion, contrary to the ordinary way of judicial proceeding, for a&s;certaining the compen&s;a|tion due to this de&s;cription of creditors. Moreover, if this clau&s;e is carried into effect, the burden of pay|ing the&s;e debts will be &s;hared very unequally by the United States. Tho&s;e of them, who&s;e citizens have paid their Briti&s;h creditors, will be bound to contri|bute to the payment equally with tho&s;e who&s;e citizens are delinquent, if any &s;uch there be; whereas, by pur&s;uing the common legal remedy, the debtor alone would be &s;ubject to the burden. Nor is the execu|tive conceived to be competent to pledge the Unit|ed States to pay the &s;um awarded by the commi&s;&s;ion|ers who are to liquidate tho&s;e claims;&mdash;the con&s;titu|tion having expre&s;sly declared, that no money &s;hall be drawn from the trea&s;ury, but in con&s;equence of ap|propriations made by law, by which it is pre&s;umed mu&s;t be intended an <HI>act</HI> of the legi&s;lature, not a <HI>trea|ty</HI> of commerce.</P>
<P N="11">11. The claims of American citizens for lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;|tained by rea&s;on of illegal captures, are to be taken into con&s;ideration at too great a di&s;tance of time, and are placed upon a footing too precarious to expect any compen&s;ation. It appears evidently to have been the policy of Great Britain to procra&s;tinate the &s;ettle|ment of all her differences with America, until &s;he was at peace with France; and it has excited general re|gret, that &s;he has been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in this part of her negociation. It was expected, that the American envoy was charged to demand &s;atisfaction from the Bri|ti&s;h government, among other things, particularly for
<PB N="166" REF="029752_0171_0FE25496D8AFD6E8">
their wanton and unju&s;t depredations on our com|merce. The&s;e &s;poliations being made in virtue of or|ders i&s;&s;ued by the king in council, and being mani|fe&s;tly illegal and unju&s;t, re&s;titution became a national concern. It was well known, that, by the ordinary cour&s;e of proceeding in the admiralty, compen&s;ation could not be obtained for national injuries&mdash;Yet, in|&s;tead of in&s;i&s;ting upon a &s;ummary compen&s;ation from the Briti&s;h government, in the &s;ame mode which had been adopted for &s;atisfying the Briti&s;h creditors, the American claimant mu&s;t fir&s;t undergo a tedious and expen&s;ive proce&s;s, in order to a&s;certain a thing alrea|dy known, that the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice is in|competent to afford him redre&s;s.</P>
<P N="12">12. The treaty pledges the United States to the payment of lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by rea&s;on of certain cap|tures within the limits and juri&s;diction of the United States, and brought into the ports of the &s;ame, or made by ve&s;&s;els originally armed in our ports.</P>
<P>The &s;um which may be claimed by Great Britain on this account, cannot fail to be very con&s;iderable: But it may well be doubted, whether the United States are not hereby pledged beyond the obligation which the laws of nations impo&s;e upon a neutral country.</P>
<P N="13">13. By permitting Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to hold lands which they have already purcha&s;ed within the United States, a right is a&s;&s;umed by the executive, of depriv|ing the &s;everal &s;tates of the forfeitures which may have already accrued to them by the alieni&s;m of &s;uch pur|cha&s;ers; and even of dive&s;ting American citizens of the land which they may have purcha&s;ed, in con&s;e|quence of &s;uch forfeitures. The policy, al&s;o, of per|mitting aliens to hold real property, may be doubted&mdash;Nor is there any real reciprocity in this permi&s;&s;ion, none, or very few American citizens having bought lands on &s;o precarious a tenure in England.</P>
<P N="14">14. The &s;ame want of reciprocity may be di&s;cover|ed in that clau&s;e of the treaty which interdicts the
<PB N="167" REF="029752_0172_0FE254A0DBEE6BD0">
confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tering of debts due to individuals, or monies held in the public funds, and in banks: However impolitic or unju&s;t it may be, in ordinary ca&s;es, to exerci&s;e this power, yet, as it is &s;trictly per|mitted by the laws of nations, and may &s;ometimes be exerted for the prevention of a war, by deterring a nation from further aggre&s;&s;ion, or to bring an ene|my to rea&s;onable terms of accommodation, and has been actually exerci&s;ed by Great Britain in her pre|&s;ent conte&s;t, it is impolitic, in the extreme, to pledge the public faith never to exerci&s;e it upon any occa&s;i|on, or under any circum&s;tance what&s;oever, e&s;pecially to a nation who can give us no equivalent for con&s;ent|ing to this re&s;triction, and which, of all others, might be the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affected by the u&s;e of it.</P>
<P N="15">15. Our commerce to India is much circum&s;cribed by the treaty. We are excluded altogether from the coa&s;ting trade, and laid under other unu&s;ual and new re&s;trictions. It is true, that this commerce has hi|therto been carried on only by permi&s;&s;ion&mdash;But it is pre&s;umed, that the advantage which Great Britain has experienced during twelve years, will induce her to permit its continuance without our unnece&s;&s;arily con|&s;enting to the&s;e re&s;traints. And if we are excluded altogether from the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements in India, other ports, equally advantageous, are open to us.</P>
<P N="16">16. By the con&s;titution, congre&s;s are to regulate our commerce with foreign nations. This treaty, if ratified, will not only infringe this power, but very greatly &s;hackle our government, in their future regu|lations of trade.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t always have been a matter of much &s;olici|tude with Great Britain, to prevent us from pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch di&s;criminating acts as circum&s;tances might render proper&mdash;And America, &s;ituated as &s;he is, &s;hould not lightly part with &s;uch an invaluable prerogative.</P>
<P N="17">17. As a neutral and commercial people, and like|ly, with common prudence, to continue at peace with all the world, the United States &s;hould never volun|tarily
<PB N="168" REF="029752_0173_0FE254A26C58BCC8">
con&s;ent to any article prohibiting free ve&s;&s;els from making free goods. This is the ca&s;e with the pre&s;ent treaty&mdash;by this conce&s;&s;ion we not only depart from a principle adopted by &s;everal maritime powers, and which congre&s;s, under this con&s;ideration, fre|quently recognized and always pur&s;ued, in their inter|cour&s;e with other nations; but we put it out of our power to receive any advantage from the modern law of nations referred to in the pre&s;ident's proclamation of neutrality, and are even precluded from the bene|fits of the contrary &s;tipulations which have been care|fully in&s;erted in our treaties with other nations.</P>
<P N="18">18. In a&s;certaining what articles &s;hall be deemed contraband, &s;everal are comprehended which were ne|ver &s;o deemed, and are expre&s;sly declared not to be &s;o, in our treaties with other nations, particularly &s;hip|timber, tar, hemp, &s;ails, and copper. Indeed it is difficult to &s;ay what will not be deemed contraband, as, after a very long enumeration, it is added, that generally whatever may &s;erve directly to the equipment of ve&s;&s;els, unwrought iron and fir-planks only except|ed, &s;hall be con&s;idered in that light. It may be ob|&s;erved here, that Great Britain, in her treaty with France, has declared the&s;e very articles NOT to be contraband.</P>
<P N="19">19. Ve&s;&s;els, laden with provi&s;ions, may be &s;eized under the frivolous pretext of the difficulty of agree|ing on the preci&s;e ca&s;es in which they may be re|garded as contraband. It is true that a rea&s;onable mercantile profit is to be allowed; but independent of the difficulty of a&s;certaining what &s;uch a profit is, of which the Briti&s;h mu&s;t judge, all the profits con|templated on the return-cargo, will be lo&s;t; and our citizens, to the great injury of agriculture, will be di&s;couraged from the exportation of grain and other provi&s;ion, which, in time of war, mu&s;t be an object of the fir&s;t magnitude.</P>
<P N="20">20. Great Britain being actually at war, derives an immediate benefit from all tho&s;e articles which refer to
<PB N="169" REF="029752_0174_0FE254A4009C1120">
that condition, while it is problematical, whether the United States, even when at war, can at all be bene|fited by the&s;e &s;tipulations. Some equivalent might, therefore, rea&s;onably have been expected for the con|&s;tant advantages which re&s;ult to Great Britain from tho&s;e parts of the treaty, which contemplate a war between either party and &s;ome other power.</P>
<P N="21">21. The treaty is principally calculated to promote the intere&s;ts of Great Britain, pending her pre&s;ent conflict with France, to increa&s;e her re&s;ources, and enable her to pro&s;ecute the war with greater vigor and &s;ucce&s;s. The citizens of America are thus expo&s;ed to the imputation of the ba&s;e&s;t ingratitude, if not breach of &s;aith, towards a generous and gallantally, to whom they are largely indebted for their freedom and inde|pendence, and to who&s;e victories is to be a&s;cribed the peace which they now enjoy.</P>
<P N="22">22. The whole treaty may be regarded as peculiar|ly ho&s;tile to the French republic, and unle&s;s tho&s;e who are at the head of her affairs, conduct them&s;elves with uncommon moderation, a war with France can hardly fail to be one of the con&s;equences of a ratifica|tion.</P>
<P N="23">23. The re&s;traint upon our citizens not to accept commi&s;&s;ions in the army or navy of foreign powers is impolitic, as it deprives them of a mean of acquiring military knowledge, and that in a way which has ne|ver been e&s;teemed illegal or di&s;reputable. It is al&s;o unprecedented; for nothing is more common than for the citizens of one country to &s;erve in the army or na|vy of another, for the &s;ake of honor, in&s;truction or reward. The United States, in particular, &s;hould encourage &s;uch of their youth as are ambitious of mi|litary glory, to a &s;ervice of this kind. In time of war it is not ea&s;y to calculate the advantages which might be derived from it.</P>
<P N="24">24. However proper it may be to di&s;courage neu|tral citizens from engaging on board of the priva|teers,
<PB N="170" REF="029752_0175_0FE254A594345918">
it may certainly be que&s;tioned, whether the right of defining and puni&s;hing piracy does not be|long exclu&s;ively to the legi&s;lature of the United States. Although a &s;imilar provi&s;ion is found in our treaties with other nations, it will be recollected, that in con|gre&s;s at that time, and not in the executive, was ve&s;t|ed the right of making treaties.</P>
<P N="25">25. This treaty would be dangerous as a prece|dent: for other nations, with whom we may wi&s;h to make commercial compacts, will expect us to &s;ubmit to &s;imilar embarra&s;&s;ments, and to have our trade regu|lated by this partial &s;tandard.</P>
<P N="26">26. There is good rea&s;on to believe, that the trea|ty is di&s;agreeable to a very great majority of the peo|ple of the United States; and that even tho&s;e who do not publicly remon&s;trate again&s;t its ratification, from an opinion that it is the proper province of the execu|tive to determine on it, &s;incerely wi&s;h it may not take place.</P>
<P N="27">27. The di&s;advantages already enumerated are the more &s;triking, becau&s;e, from the nature and extent of their exports, the United States have it in their pow|er, in all their commercial arrangements with foreign nations, to &s;ecure a perfect reciprocity, not only with their European, but al&s;o with their foreign, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons, as has indeed been offered to them on the part of the French republic.</P>
<P N="28">28. Be&s;ides the objections already &s;tated, it mu&s;t be remarked that the whole treaty abounds with &s;en|tences who&s;e meaning is equivocal, and that too much room is left for doubt, con&s;truction and future di&s;cu&s;|&s;ions; whereas every ambiguity in an in&s;trument of this kind, with &s;o powerful a nation, ought to have been &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved further, that a copy of the preceding re&s;olutions be &s;igned by the chairman, and tran&s;mit|ted by expre&s;s to the pre&s;ident of the United States, who is hereby informed, that the citizens of New York, a&s;&s;embled upon this occa&s;ion, re&s;pectfully hope,
<PB N="171" REF="029752_0176_0FE254B0146855B0">
that he will plea&s;e to take the &s;ame into his mo&s;t &s;eri|ous con&s;ideration&mdash;they a&s;&s;ure him that they rely with great confidence on his known patrioti&s;m, wi&s;dom, and independence, in the exerci&s;e of the prerogative ve&s;ted in him, and that nothing but the importance of the occa&s;ion &s;hould have induced them to obtrude their &s;entiments on him. Influenced by no other mo|tive than a zeal for their country's good, they ardent|ly hope that the rea&s;ons herein a&s;&s;igned, with tho&s;e which may be offered by their fellow citizens of other &s;tates, added to &s;uch as his own good &s;en&s;e will not fail to &s;ugge&s;t, will prevail upon him to withhold his a&s;&s;ent from an in&s;trument which has &s;pread a general alarm throughout the United States, as invading the con&s;titution and legi&s;lative authority of the country; as abandoning their important and well-founded claims again&s;t the Brti&s;h government; as impo&s;ing unju&s;t and impolitic re&s;traints on their commerce; as injuri|ous to agriculture; as conceding, without an equiva|lent important advantages, to Great Britain; as ho&s;|tile and ungrateful to France; as committing our peace with that great republic; as unequal in every re&s;pect to America; as hazarding her internal peace and pro&s;perity, and as derogatory from her &s;overeign|ty and independence.</P>

Becau&s;e by the treaty, the federal government accedes to re&s;traints upon the American commerce and navigation, internal as well as external, that embrace no principle of real reciprocity, and are incon&s;i&s;tent with the rights, and de&s;tructive to the intere&s;ts, of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> independent nation&mdash;ina&s;much as it unrea&s;onably fet|ters the intercour&s;e with the We&s;t Indies, with India, and with the American lakes, by means of the navi|gable rivers belonging to the Briti&s;h&mdash;ina&s;much as, in many in&s;tances, it circum&s;cribes the navigation of the United States to a particular voyage&mdash;and, ina&s;much as &s;ome of our &s;taple commodities (exempted by the
<PB N="174" REF="029752_0179_0FE254B60C6825C0">
treaties with France, Holland, Pru&s;&s;ia, and Sweden) it makes liable to confi&s;cation, as contraband; and others (exempted by the law of nations) it makes li|able to &s;eizure, upon payment of an arbitrary price, as articles u&s;eful to the enemies of Great Britain.</P>
<P N="3">3. Bccau&s;e the treaty is de&s;tructive to the dome&s;tic independence and pro&s;perity of the United States&mdash;ina&s;much as it admits aliens, profe&s;&s;ing a foreign alle|giance, to the permanent and tran&s;mi&s;&s;ible rights of property, peculiarly belonging to a citizen&mdash;and ina&s;|much as it enables Great Britain to draw an invidious and dangerous line of circumvallation round the terri|tory of the union, by her fleets on the Atlantic, and by her &s;ettlements from Nova Scotia to the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi.</P>
<P N="4">4. Becau&s;e the treaty &s;urrenders certain inherent powers of an independent government, which are e&s;|&s;ential, in the circum&s;tances of the United States, to their &s;afety and defence; and which might, on great emergencies, be &s;ucce&s;sfully employed to enforce the neglected claims of ju&s;tice, without making the la&s;t, dreadful appeal to arms;&mdash;ina&s;much as the right of &s;eque&s;tration; the right of regulating commerce, in favor of a friendly, and again&s;t a rival, power; and the right of &s;u&s;pending a commercial intercour&s;e, with an inimical nation, are voluntarily abandoned.</P>
<P N="5">5. Becau&s;e the treaty is an infraction of the rights of friend&s;hip, gratitude, and alliance, which the re|public of France may ju&s;tly claim from the United States; and deprives the United States of the mo&s;t powerful means to &s;ecure the good will and good of|fices of other nations;&mdash;ina&s;much as it alters, during a war, the relative &s;ituation of the different nations, advantageou&s;ly to Great Britain, and prejudicially to the French republic;&mdash;ina&s;much as it is in manife&s;t colli&s;ion with &s;everal articles of the American treaty with France;&mdash;and ina&s;much as it grants to Great Britain certain high, dangerous, and exclu&s;ive privi|leges.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="029752_0180_0FE254BFB6E9E838">And your memoriali&s;ts, having this, upon gene|ral ground, conci&s;ely, but explicitly, avowed their wi&s;hes and opinions; and forbearing a minute &s;pecifi|cation of the many other objections that occur;&mdash;con|clude with an a&s;&s;urance, that by refu&s;ing to ratify the projected treaty, you will, according to their be&s;t in|formation and judgment, at once evince an exalted attachment to the principles of the con&s;titution of the United States, and an undimini&s;hed zeal to advance the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of your con&s;tituents.</P>

<HEAD>REPORT Of the Committee cho&s;en by Ballot of the Citizens of <HI>Charle&s;ton (South Carolina)</HI> in Pur&s;uance of a Re&s;olution of a General Meeting of the Citizens in St. Michael's Church, on Thur&s;day, the 16th of July, <HI>1795.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE committee to whom was referred, by their fellow citizens, the con&s;ideration of the im|pending treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation,
<PB N="176" REF="029752_0181_0FE254C14B4FBC98">
between his Britannic maje&s;ty and the United States of America, report&mdash;</P>
<P>That they have attentively con&s;idered the &s;aid trea|ty, and are of opinion, that it has not that re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ipro|city which ought to be the ba&s;is of all contracts&mdash;that it contains no provi&s;ions in favor of the United States, in any manner proportionate to the various con|ce&s;&s;ions made to Great Britain; and re&s;tricts congre&s;s in the exerci&s;e of its con&s;titutional power of regulat|ing trade, and making &s;uch di&s;criminations in favor of other foreign nations, as may be mo&s;t beneficial.</P>
<P>From many well-founded objections, your commit|tee beg leave to &s;elect and &s;ubmit the following:</P>
<P>The fir&s;t article, though u&s;ual in treaties, would be particularly mi&s;chievous in this, ina&s;much as it per|mits the unconditional return, to our country, of all per&s;ons who were pro&s;cribed during the late war, though their return is repugnant to our laws, and to the feelings of our injured fellow citizens, and though the &s;tate legi&s;latures have already proceeded as far in re-admitting &s;uch per&s;ons, as they judged con&s;i&s;tent with good faith, or &s;ound policy.</P>
<P>The &s;econd article &s;anctions the continuance of an injury, which, in violation of the treaty of peace, has already exi&s;ted eleven years: it either e&s;tabli&s;hes a Briti&s;h colony within our limits, with peculiar privi|leges, or, in ca&s;e the inhabitants of &s;uch colony chu&s;e to become citizens of the United States, it gives the privileges of citizens of the&s;e &s;tates to a number of men, who have been their mo&s;t bitter and irreconcile|able enemies; who, in conjunction with the &s;avages, have lately waged war again&s;t us, and who, from their local &s;ituation in the vicinity of the Indian tribes, con|veniently may, and from their di&s;po&s;ition (as far as we can judge from their pa&s;t conduct) would be in|clined to join with them, in acting again&s;t us on any favorable emergency.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="029752_0182_0FE254C2D9DBD3C8">The third article gives to the Briti&s;h, what to them, with their capital, will be nearly equivalent to a mo|nopoly of the trade with the Indians, and with our we&s;tern territories, and opens a door for &s;muggling on an exten&s;ive &s;cale, to the great injury of our re|venue.</P>
<P>By the &s;ixth article, the United States undertake to make good &s;uch lo&s;&s;es on debts, to Briti&s;h credi|tors, as have been occa&s;ioned by legal impediments, to their recovery, created by any of the &s;tates, in vi|olation (as is alleged) of the treaty of peace; al|though the fir&s;t infraction of that treaty, was made on the part of Great Britain, by carrying away from the&s;e &s;tates many thou&s;ands of negroes, and a con&s;i|derable quantity of valuable property, whereby indivi|duals were deprived of the means of di&s;charging their debts; although the United States have incurred an immen&s;e expen&s;e in maintaining an army for the de|fence of their northern and we&s;tern territory; an ex|pen&s;e actually occa&s;ioned in con&s;equence of the deten|tion of the we&s;tern po&s;ts; and although no compen|&s;ation is &s;tipulated to be made to the citizens, who&s;e negroes, and other property, have been illegally car|ried off; their right of recovery being pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence. Thus the United States are compelled to make ample reparation, for the only infringement of the treaty, which is charged on any of their citizens; whil&s;t neither the union, nor its citizens, have even a promi&s;e of compen&s;ation, for the many injuries &s;u&s;|tained by violations of the &s;aid treaty, on the part of Great Britain.</P>
<P>This article, moreover, erects a tribunal new and unknown to our con&s;titution, ina&s;much as it transfers the right of deciding on the claims of Briti&s;h credi|tors, from the courts and juries of America, to com|mi&s;&s;ioners; a majority of whom may be Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects, and by their deci&s;ions, tax the revenue of the&s;e &s;tates at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="029752_0183_0FE254C4670A9160">The &s;eventh article makes re&s;titution for the exten|&s;ive &s;poliations lately committed on our commerce, re|mote, expen&s;ive and uncertain; though ju&s;tice, and the circum&s;tances of our injured citizens demanded that it &s;hould have been immediate and complete; while, on the other hand, full compen&s;ation, on cer|tain fixed principles, is &s;tipulated to be made by the United States, for all property which has been taken by privateers, equipped in our ports, or which has been captured within our limits.</P>
<P>The twelfth article gives us no other privilege than that of carrying in American ve&s;&s;els (not exceeding &s;eventy tons burden) &s;uch articles of the growth, ma|nufacture, or production of the&s;e &s;tates, as are not, and &s;hall not be prohibited by Great-Britain, from being carried to her We&s;t-India I&s;lands, and of bring|ing from thence, in &s;uch American ve&s;&s;els, &s;uch pro|duce of tho&s;e i&s;lands, as may be carried from thence to the United States in Briti&s;h ve&s;els:&mdash;In return for this privilege (which, re&s;tricted as it is, is of no value) we are made to &s;urrender the right of ex|porting in our own ve&s;&s;els, to any part of the world, mela&s;&s;es, &s;ugar, coffee and cocoa, whether the pro|ductions of the Briti&s;h i&s;lands, or of any other place, whil&s;t the Briti&s;h, and all other foreign powers, have a right to &s;end tho&s;e very articles, in their ve&s;&s;els, from our ports.&mdash;We are precluded from exporting in our own ve&s;&s;els, not only foreign cotton, but the cotton of our own growth, although the privilege of exporting that article, from hence, in their own ve&s;|&s;els, is given to the Briti&s;h. It precludes us from &s;upplying our allies, the French, with &s;everal articles, which they con&s;ider as of prime nece&s;&s;ity, and which, in the exi&s;ting &s;tate of things, they cannot (without great ri&s;k and difficulty) obtain from their We&s;t-In|dia i&s;lands, but through the medium of neutral pow|ers, more particularly the United States. In fact, it has placed the commodities, above mentioned, on a footing far wor&s;e for us than if they were contra|band
<PB N="179" REF="029752_0184_0FE254CD4CDDB380">
of war; ina&s;much as contraband articles are only prohibited from being carried to powers at war: but the&s;e articles cannot, under the re&s;trictions of the treaty, be carried by ve&s;&s;els of the United States, to any nation, either in time of war, or of peace.</P>
<P>Although it is recommended, that a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of this article &s;hould precede the ratification of the trea|ty; yet it having been al&s;o recommended to the pre|&s;ident to proceed, without delay, to further negoci|ations with his Britannic maje&s;ty, on the &s;ubject of trade to his We&s;t-India i&s;lands, and on the terms and conditions mentioned in this article, your committee have, therefore, thought proper to &s;ubmit the&s;e ob&s;er|vations on it.</P>
<P>The &s;eventeenth article, makes a formal recogni|tion of the right of Great-Britain to &s;earch Ameri|can ve&s;&s;els, for property on board &s;uch ve&s;&s;els, &s;u&s;|pected to belong to any power, with which &s;he is at war: it authorizes her to carry into her ports, every American ve&s;&s;el, which the officers of her men of war, and privateers, may &s;u&s;pect to have &s;uch property on board: and engages to deliver up all &s;uch property, though of our friends and allies, which &s;hall be on board: whereas France, and every nation, with which we have a treaty, have expre&s;sly declared, that free &s;hips &s;hall make free goods, and protect property on board of them, to whom&s;oever it may belong.</P>
<P>By authorizing &s;uch &s;earches, a general &s;earch war|rant is given to Briti&s;h privateers. This article e&s;ta|bli&s;hes principles as the law of nations, which ju&s;tify many of the late &s;poliations committed by Briti&s;h ve&s;|&s;els of war, on the commerce of the&s;e &s;tates; and of cour&s;e authorize the repetition of &s;uch &s;polia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on, which would be extremely detrimental to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> commerce. The capture and detention of American, by Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, under the authority of this article, will put American &s;eamen wholly in the power of the Briti&s;h; yet no provi&s;ion is made to protect and &s;ecure them
<PB N="180" REF="029752_0185_0FE2537337718310">
from being impre&s;&s;ed into the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, though daily experience evinces the nece&s;&s;ity of requiring a clear and unequivocal &s;tipulation for the protection and &s;ecurity of that valuable cla&s;s of men.</P>
<P>By the fir&s;t &s;ection of the eighteenth article, all timber, for &s;hip building, tar, ro&s;in, copper in &s;heets, &s;ails, hemp, cordage, and in general whatever may &s;erve directly for the equipment of ve&s;&s;els (unwrought iron and fir planks only excepted) are declared to be contraband, and ju&s;t objects of confi&s;cation&mdash;whereas tho&s;e articles, in all our other treaties, are expre&s;sly ac|knowledged not to be contraband, but free. Thus A|merica concedes to Great Britain. what &s;he has never conceded to any other power.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;econd &s;ection of the eigh|teenth article, an attempt is made to bring even pro|vi&s;ions under the head of contraband. This, if effect|ed, in conjunction with the preceding clau&s;e, will comprehend as contraband, almo&s;t all the important &s;taples of the&s;e &s;tates. Such an exten&s;ion of contra|band mu&s;t prove ruinous to our commerce, e&s;pecially as Great Britain affects to hold whole countries in a &s;tate of blockade.</P>
<P>The twenty-third, twenty-fourth, and twenty-fifth articles, have a tendency to embroil us with the French republic, and in the exi&s;ting &s;tate of things, to make our &s;ea port towns &s;cenes of riot and blood&s;hed. The&s;e articles al&s;o tend to make a common cau&s;e be|tween the United States and Great Britain, to op|pre&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s our allies.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, your committee apprehend that great evils would re&s;ult to the&s;e &s;tates from this trea|ty, if ratified, they therefore, recommend that an ad|dre&s;s be prepared, and pre&s;ented to the pre&s;ident of the United States, praying that he will not ratify the &s;aid treaty.</P>
<P>The above report was agreed to, and tran&s;mitted to the pre&s;ident.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE perceive, with pain and regret, that you are urged, with much intemperance and heat, to meet to-morrow, not to con&s;ider and di&s;cu&s;s the treaty lately negociated with Great Britain, and to expre&s;s the conviction which &s;hall ari&s;e from a fair examination of its merits, but to condemn and oppo&s;e it as a thing prejudged.</P>
<P>You are told that it is ignominious and di&s;graceful; that it <HI>&s;urrenders rights and privileges ruinous to our commerce&mdash;that it yields advantages which we ought never to part with but with our lives;</HI> that it makes &s;acrifices for which we have no equivalent; in &s;hort, that it &s;ettles principles dangerous to the liberties and happi|ne&s;s of the people, and de&s;tructive of our freedom and independence.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;trong charges indeed again&s;t the treaty&mdash;If they can be made out, it certainly de&s;erves the reprobation of every good citizen; and no man, faith|ful to the intere&s;ts of his country, ought to withhold the expre&s;&s;ion of his abhorrence of it.</P>
<P>But ought we ha&s;tily to believe that &s;uch charges can be well founded? Can we ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded, that the citizen who negociated the treaty, and who on all former occa&s;ions has given decided proof of fidelity and patrioti&s;m, could of a &s;udden become &s;o ba&s;e a betrayer of the rights and intere&s;ts of his coun|try? Can we imagine that two-thirds of the repre|&s;entatives of the United States, in their &s;enate, would have &s;anctioned &s;o foul a trea&s;on? Can we think our interpo&s;ition nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the ratification of &s;uch a treaty by that wi&s;e and virtuous man, that long and well-tried &s;ervant of his country, in whom the executive authority of the United States is depo|&s;ited?</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="029752_0193_0FE254EDBA421BB8">No, Fellow citizens! it is impo&s;&s;ible that the frightful picture given of the treaty can be a ju&s;t one.&mdash;Such charges are better proofs of the intemperance of tho&s;e who make them, than of the defects of the treaty.</P>
<P>You cannot but be &s;en&s;ible that the treaty, if &s;uch as it is repre&s;ented, mu&s;t affect deeply the intere&s;ts of the mercantile cla&s;s. You cannot doubt that the merchants are attentive to their intere&s;ts, and you can hardly &s;uppo&s;e that they are ignorant of them.</P>
<P>For our part, we pro&s;e&s;s to you frankly, that we have not yet been able to di&s;cover in the treaty, tho&s;e hideous features which are alledged to exi&s;t; yet we are di&s;po&s;ed to meet the re&s;t of our fellow citizens and to promote with them a fair and rational di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject. We tru&s;t, however, that they re&s;pect them&s;elves too much not to make this a nece&s;&s;ary pre|liminary to their pronouncing an opinion&mdash;and that they will unite with us in rejecting any propo&s;itions which &s;hall be attempted to be impo&s;ed upon them without due inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>Meeting them on this ba&s;is, our ears will be open to truth, and we &s;hall be ready, according to the be&s;t of our under&s;tandings, to concur in any mea&s;ures which can be &s;hown to be con&s;i&s;tent with the true in|tere&s;ts of our country. We doubt not, you will all bring with you the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions, and we earne&s;tly recommend a general attendance upon the occa&s;ion, in order that the true &s;en&s;e of the city may appear.</P>

<P>WHEREAS, the treaty between the United States and Great Britain, lately &s;anctioned by the &s;enate, has been made the &s;ubject of public di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, in the warmth of which, mi&s;con&s;tructions and mi&s;repre&s;entations have contributed to excite and irri|tate the public mind.</P>
<P>And, Whereas a di&s;po&s;ition has appeared, in certain in&s;tances, to influence the executive again&s;t the ratifi|cation of the &s;aid treaty, whereby the tranquillity and pro&s;perity of our country may be endangered:&mdash;there|fore,</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, as the opinion of the corporation, That the &s;aid treaty, collectively con&s;idered, contains as ma|ny features of reciprocity, as, upon contemplating the relative intere&s;ts of the re&s;pective countries, could rea|&s;onably have been expected. And that the precari|ous privileges of the American trade to Great Britain and her colonies, are, by this treaty, changed into per|manent rights.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That the provi&s;ions in the &s;aid treaty, for a quiet &s;urrender of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, and an amica|ble adju&s;tment of the Briti&s;h debts, a fair compen&s;a|tion for the &s;poliations upon our commerce, and for the prevention of future depredations, are wi&s;ely ar|ranged for the great purpo&s;es of national ju&s;tice, and to pre&s;erve the ble&s;&s;ings of peace.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That if the treaty &s;hould fail to be rati|fied, we &s;hould apprehend a &s;tate of things which might lead to ho&s;tilities; in which event, our navi|gation (now di&s;per&s;ed in all quarters of the globe) may be intercepted, our under-writers injured, our commerce abridged, our produce reduced to little va|lue,

our artizans, mechanics and labourers deprived of employment, our revenue dimini&s;hed, and the lives of our fellow citizens &s;acrificed.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That although the ratification of this treaty, for the foregoing rea&s;ons, appears to us, un|der all circum&s;tances, expedient; yet we cheerfully re&s;t it where it is placed by the con&s;titution: in full confidence, that the wi&s;dom and firmne&s;s under which our independence has been atchieved, and our pro|gre&s;s to wealth, power, and re&s;pectability promoted beyond a parallel, will, in this in&s;tance, determine for the be&s;t intere&s;ts of this country.</P>

<SALUTE>MR. BROWN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I OBSERVE in the new&s;papers, that it &s;eems to be univer&s;ally taken for granted, that the pre|&s;ident has a negative on the proceedings of the &s;enate, re&s;pecting the treaty with Great-Britain. We are informed, that petitions are framing, to be pre&s;ented to him, to withhold his a&s;&s;ent to the treaty; and that wagers, to a con&s;iderable amount, have been actually laid, that he will accede to it, or reject <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="191" REF="029752_0196_0FE254F9DAA4B590">
according as the wi&s;hes or principles of per&s;ons have preponderated on the &s;ubject. I confe&s;s, &s;ir, I have been a little &s;urpri&s;ed at all this; becau&s;e I by no means think the po&s;ition an obvious and undeniable one, that the pre&s;ident has a controuling power, in the <HI>pre&s;ent &s;tage</HI> of the bu&s;ine&s;s, on what the &s;enate have done.</P>
<P>The words of the con&s;titution are, "he (the pre|&s;ident) &s;hall have power, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the &s;enators pre&s;ent, concur; and he &s;hall nominate, and by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, &s;hall appoint amba&s;&s;adors, other public mini&s;ters, and con&s;uls, judges of the &s;upreme court, and all other officers of the United States, who&s;e ap|pointments are not herein otherwi&s;e provided for, and which &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law."</P>
<P>From the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions it is clear, the pre&s;ident can make no treaty, nor appoint an amba&s;&s;ador, without the con&s;ent and advice of the &s;enate. It is, therefore, of great importance to a&s;certain the <HI>time when</HI> this <HI>con&s;ent and advice</HI> of the &s;enate is to be given, and the force and meaning of the expre&s;&s;ions. In the u&s;ual and ordinary method of appointing officers, the moment the &s;enate con&s;ent to the nomination made by the pre&s;ident, and advi&s;e him to make the appointment, it is allowed, on all hands, he is con|&s;titutionally obliged to appoint &s;uch officer. The &s;enate indeed make u&s;e of the words, "<HI>con&s;ent and</HI> advi&s;e," in reply to the pre&s;ident's nomination of per|&s;ons to fill offices. But the&s;e words are the technical and con&s;titutional language pre&s;cribed to them; and while they deprive <HI>him</HI> of all option as to the appoint|ment, do clearly imply an obligation to appoint on <HI>the part</HI> of the pre&s;ident. In the ca&s;e of a treaty being laid before the &s;enate, and their giving their con&s;ent, and advi&s;ing the pre&s;ident to ratify it, I can &s;ee no rea&s;on why a &s;imilar con&s;truction &s;hould not be adopted. The words are the &s;ame in both ca&s;es,
<PB N="192" REF="029752_0197_0FE254FB6A5B8568">
except that in the appointment of officers, the word "nominate," is nece&s;&s;arily introduced. The treaty, in the <HI>fir&s;t in&s;tance,</HI> is made by the pre&s;ident&mdash;and he may therefore be con&s;idered as having con&s;titutionally u&s;ed that <HI>power of making treaties,</HI> with the con&s;ent and advice of the &s;enate, which the con&s;titution has given him. His laying it afterwards before the &s;e|nate for their advice and con&s;ent, is not merely with a view to con&s;ult them or take their opinion. If this were the ca&s;e, the &s;enate of the United States would be a collection of mere cyphers. If the pre&s;ident can, in this manner, put his veto on their "advice and con&s;ent" (words which I apprehend are equivalent to an order or command) it is evident, that in&s;tead of the &s;enate having any real power in the making of treaties, they will not have even the &s;hadow of it. The pre&s;ident will be the <HI>&s;ole maker</HI> of all treaties: and &s;hould it happen, which is very po&s;&s;ible, that the &s;enate unanimou&s;ly con&s;ent to a treaty and advi&s;e the ratification of it, &s;till the pre&s;ident may refu&s;e to fol|low their advice and over-rule the opinion of the whole &s;enate. However clearly and unanimou&s;ly they may concur in the idea, that the treaty is highly benefici|al to their country, yet the opinion of a &s;ingle man is &s;ufficient to outweigh the united judgment of the whole &s;enate on this mo&s;t intere&s;ting que&s;tion. This doctrine does not look very republican; and &s;eems to cla&s;h with the general principles of the con&s;titution, which has guarded, with extreme caution, again&s;t tru&s;ting power in the hands of <HI>one,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to the wi&s;hes and opinions of <HI>many.</HI></P>
<P>Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, the pre&s;ident receives a treaty from a foreign mini&s;ter, and that he cordially di&s;ap|proves of it. The &s;enate, however, on his laying it before them, think quite differently, and <HI>unanimou&s;ly</HI> give their con&s;ert to it, and advi&s;e him to ratify it.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e, pray, Mr. Brown, who&s;e opinion is to decide the que&s;tion? Is the pre&s;ident, by refu&s;ing to ratify the treaty, to defeat the wi&s;hes of the United
<PB N="193" REF="029752_0198_0FE254FCFACE4E58">
States, as expre&s;&s;ed by the united voice of the whole national body? I confe&s;s, &s;ir, I extremely doubt whether this be the genuine con&s;truction of the fede|ral con&s;titution&mdash;it would rather &s;eem, the <HI>power</HI> he has of making treaties, with the advice and con&s;ent of two-thirds of the &s;enators, &s;hould be deemed to extend no further than his making them, in <HI>the fir&s;t in&s;tance,</HI> through the medium or channel of the fo|reign min&s;ter, and that, when laid before &s;enate, their opinion is <HI>final</HI> thereon.</P>
<P>This con&s;truction will &s;atisfy the words of the con|&s;titution, without making a cypher of the pre&s;ident on the one hand, or of the whole &s;enatorial body on the other. The pre&s;ident, according to this idea, will po&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>power of making treaties,</HI> but not to the exclu&s;ion of the &s;enate. And the &s;enate, by their <HI>"con&s;ent and advice,"</HI> will po&s;&s;e&s;s the ultimatum on the &s;ubject of foreign treaties, which the con&s;titution has ve&s;ted in them.</P>
<P>What are the forms of making treaties by the exe|cutive of the United States, I am not certainly in|formed; but have under&s;tood, he &s;ends abroad the mini&s;ter, without <HI>previou&s;ly</HI> communicating to the &s;enate the in&s;tructions given to him. A treaty, there|fore, made under &s;uch circum&s;tances, may, with great propriety, be viewed as one <HI>made</HI> by the pre&s;ident within the words of the con&s;titution. And it would be &s;trange to &s;ay, that he &s;hould not only have the fir&s;t concoction of the treaty, but the ultimate power of rejecting it, in oppo&s;ition to the &s;enate; making them a parcel of non-entities. And on the other hand, even if the in&s;tructions for the u&s;e of the am|ba&s;&s;ador, down up by the pre&s;ident, are laid before the &s;enate, and approved of by them, I do not &s;ee how, this could alter the ca&s;e; becau&s;e the pre&s;ident, by &s;uch act, has exerci&s;ed his <HI>power in making the treaty,</HI> and therefore can never afterwards controul the vote of the &s;enate, approving or rejecting &s;uch treaty.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="029752_0199_0FE25620A7624E50">In &s;hort, Mr. Brown, the con&s;truction that will be mo&s;t agreeable to the &s;cope, &s;pirit, and genius of the con&s;titution, and <HI>at all times hereafter</HI> &s;afe for the United States (for too much power cannot be tru&s;ted to the pre&s;ent illu&s;trious character who fills the office of the executive) will be, to con&s;ider the pre&s;ident's laying a treaty before the &s;enate, in the &s;ame light as his nominating a gentleman to an office. In this latter ca&s;e, their con&s;ent and advice is equivalent to a command, and carries with it a <HI>con&s;titutional obligation</HI> to appoint the per&s;on nominated. In like manner, their con&s;ent to a treaty made by the pre&s;ident, and their advice to him to ratify it, are final, conclu&s;ive, and obligatory upon him. In both ca&s;es, he is con|templated by the con&s;titution as the agent, the in&s;tru|ment, or prime mover in the bu&s;ine&s;s.

<HEAD>No. 1</HEAD>
<P>THE treaty between Great Britain and America has been a matter of great public expectation, and it has been rendered more intere&s;ting by the time and manner in which the negociation originated.</P>
<P>Before the revolution in America, the people of the then colonies were under the government of Great
<PB N="195" REF="029752_0200_0FE24BCFD29362E8">
Britain; they con&s;idered them&s;elves as children of the &s;ame family; their trade was almo&s;t limited to the Briti&s;h dominions; the Americans had e&s;tates in Great Britain, and monies in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> funds; an exten&s;ive com|merce had created innumerable debts and connections between the two countries, which could not be at once di&s;charged and di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>A long, expen&s;ive, and bloody war, to re&s;i&s;t the unju&s;t claims of the Briti&s;h parliament, attended with many in&s;tances of atrocious cruelty and perfidy on the part of the Briti&s;h governors and commanders, alien|ated the affections of the great body of Americans from the mother country. On the re&s;toration of peace, however, and the acqui&s;ition of independence, the enmity of the Americans gradually &s;ub&s;ided; and the u&s;efulne&s;s of the commerce of England to the&s;e &s;tates, being every where experienced, &s;oon revived the habits of friendly intercour&s;e between America and Great Britain, which had been interrupted by the war&mdash;an intercour&s;e which was not much affected by the controver&s;ies between the two governments on account of the inexecution of the treaty of peace. Almo&s;t as &s;oon as the acceptance and organization of a con&s;titution for the United States had given them a national capacity, it was the wi&s;h and de&s;ire of Ame|rica to form a commercial treaty with Great Britain; and Mr. Jeffer&s;on, in a letter to Mr. Hammond, dated Nov. 29, 1791, reque&s;ted to know, whether he was authorized to enter into a negociation for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances which operated to defeat the attempts of our executive, and the controver&s;ies be|tween the governments of the two countries, relative to the non-fulfilment of the treaty on one &s;ide and the other, are in every man's recollection;&mdash;it is needle&s;s to mention them here. It is &s;ufficient for my pur|po&s;e, that the pre&s;ident was authorized by the public wi&s;hes, to negociate a commercial treaty with Great
<PB N="196" REF="029752_0201_0FE24BD1F1A3EE78">
Britain; and he is ve&s;ted with full powers for this pur|po&s;e by the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The uinform de&s;ire of congre&s;s on this &s;ubject, is a complete an&s;wer to all cavils about the exertion of the pre&s;ident's con&s;titutional powers. It was the na|tion, the United States, that reque&s;ted and urged for a negociation.</P>
<P>This al&s;o is an an&s;wer to the men who &s;ay, the peo|ple of America &s;uppo&s;ed the appointment of Mr. Jay as envoy extraordinary, was intended only to demand and procure a redre&s;s of wrongs, and indemnification for &s;poliations on our trade; and not for the negocia|tian of a commercial treaty.&mdash;Whatever opinion peo|ple formed of the emba&s;&s;y, the in&s;tructions given to the envoy were in pur&s;uance of con&s;titutional powers; and if the people are &s;urprized with a treaty of amity and commerce, before they expected it, this forms no objection to the treaty it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The time &s;elected for this negociation, and the exerci&s;e of the pre&s;ident's powers, at the critical mo|ment, when the public mind in America was in a vio|lent flame, on account of the &s;eizure of our ve&s;&s;els by Briti&s;h privateers, and when ho&s;tilities were expected between the two countries, however offen&s;ive to a party in America, are among the mo&s;t fortunate cir|cum&s;tances of this whole bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;eque&s;tration bill, then before congre&s;s, in|volved in it the events of peace or war. The bill, had it pa&s;&s;ed, would have been con&s;idered by Great Britain equivalent to i&s;&s;uing letters of marque and re|pri&s;al, and tantamount to a declaration of ho&s;tilities; and probably that act, had it been &s;anctioned by the &s;everal branches of the legi&s;lature, would have plunged us into the pre&s;ent mo&s;t calamitous war.</P>
<P>Such a con&s;equence was con&s;idered by the pre&s;ident as little le&s;s than inevitable. As a con&s;tituent branch of the legi&s;lature, and chief magi&s;trate of the nation, he had a right to exert the powers he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed&mdash;and if he thought the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives were ra&s;h

in their mea&s;ures, it was his <HI>duty,</HI> as the chief guar|dian of the public &s;afety, to exert any of his con&s;ti|tutional powers for the purpo&s;es of arre&s;ting tho&s;e mea&s;ures. It was as much his right and his duty to interpo&s;e negociation as a means of checking any mea&s;ures that he deemed incon&s;i&s;tent with our national intere&s;t, if he judged that the be&s;t means, as it is to give his negative to a bill that has pa&s;&s;ed the other branches of the legi&s;lature, when he judges the bill uncon&s;titutional or inexpedient.</P>
<P>The <HI>right</HI> of the pre&s;ident to interpo&s;e negociation, at the time he did, cannot be di&s;puted. The <HI>expedi|ency</HI> of the mea&s;ure will perhaps never be admitted by its oppo&s;ers; but every &s;ub&s;equent event has &s;erved to convince the friends of our pre&s;ent admini&s;tration, that the mea&s;ure was highly expedient and the time well cho&s;en.</P>
<P>That the pre&s;ident was right in re&s;orting to a <HI>peaceable demand</HI> of indemnification for &s;poliations on our commerce, is capable of the highe&s;t proof. The law of nations makes it a duty, on the part of a na|tion thus injured, to make a peaceable requi&s;ition of damages or re&s;toration of property, from the aggre&s;&s;|ing nation, before the commencement of ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>Vattel, book 3, chap. 3, lays it down in the mo&s;t unequivocal language, that an injured nation has no right to re&s;ort to force for &s;atisfaction, until other means of obtaining it have proved fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>In conformity with this principle of the law of na|tions, it is often &s;tipulated by treaty, that letters of marque and repri&s;al &s;hall not be granted by an injured nation, until means of redre&s;s have been &s;ought in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice. Of this tenor is the third article of the treaty of navigation and com|merce between Great Britain and Spain, dated 1713.</P>
<P>It was in pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ce of this mo&s;t &s;alutary principle, that the pre&s;ident appointed an envoy extraordinary at the time he did; and it was undoubtedly, in other
<PB N="198" REF="029752_0203_0FE255064975A180">
re&s;pects, highly expedient; as no moment could be more eligible for a negociation with England, than when &s;he was engaged in an expen&s;ive and un&s;ucce&s;s|ful war: a war that entrenches deeply on her re&s;ources, and demands a minute attention to her commercial intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>But my oppo&s;ers will &s;ay, "We admit the propri|ety, of negociation, before the commencement of ho|&s;tilities; but we contend that our envoy &s;hould have been re&s;tricted to a demand of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, and indemnification for lo&s;&s;es by illegal captures, and con|demnation of our ve&s;&s;els and property. It was never under&s;tood, that Mr. Jay had in&s;tructions to make a commercial treaty."</P>
<P>This objection amounts to nothing, and de&s;erves no an&s;wer. The pre&s;ident had as good a right to autho|rize Mr. Jay to conclude a treaty of amity and com|merce as any other man; and he had the &s;ame right to choo&s;e one time as another.</P>
<P>Having made the&s;e preliminary remarks on the origin of this negociation and treaty, I will proceed to an&s;wer &s;uch objections to the treaty as have come to my knowledge.</P>
<P>The daily invectives of new&s;paper paragraphi&s;ts will be pa&s;&s;ed without notice. This is treating them as they de&s;erve to be treated, and as they are in fact treated by the public.</P>
<P>A writer in a morning paper under the &s;ignature of <HI>Decius,</HI> appears to have a&s;&s;ailed the treaty with more ingenuity than any other writer who&s;e argu|ments I have read; and it is probable that his writings compri&s;e the amount and force of all the objections that are made to it. I &s;hall therefore take his objec|tions in the order they are publi&s;hed, and endeavour to prove them of little weight, or wholly unfounded.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t remarks of this writer are aimed at the candour and integrity of the twenty members of the &s;enate, who, he in&s;inuates, ratified the treaty from <HI>motives of party &s;pirit.</HI> He does not indeed exempt
<PB N="199" REF="029752_0204_0FE25508F4CB9C18">
the minorty from the &s;ame cen&s;ure of their conduct. But what refutes the in&s;inuation is, the rejection of the twelfth article by the men thus criminated. Cer|tainly the &s;pirit of party was not the governing mo|tive; for party-&s;pirit is unconceding and goes all lengths to carry its points. The rejection of that ar|ticle, becau&s;e it entrenches too much on our carrying trade, in the opinion of tho&s;e gentlemen, is a proof that the <HI>intere&s;t of commerce and the public good</HI> were the motives of their conduct in a&s;&s;enting to every other part of the treaty.</P>
<P>His next remark is levelled at the &s;ecrecy of the &s;enate, in conducting the debates on the treaty. "Is not this &s;ecrecy alone, &s;ays <HI>Decius,</HI> "a proof that the &s;enate conceived it di&s;graceful and prejudicial to the United States?"</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k that writer a candid que&s;tion: Has not every treaty which we have made with other nations been concluded and ratified in &s;ecret? And is there one of tho&s;e treaties di&s;graceful or prejudicial to our nation? No objection was formerly made to the&s;e &s;e|cret ratifications. Why &s;hould rea&s;ons now exi&s;t for opening the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of treaties to the people, which did not exi&s;t in 1783 and 1785? The rea&s;on is ob|vious: Americans were formerly under no influence but that of propriety; they acted them&s;elves&mdash;Now a party of them have de&s;erted the principles which formerly guided our councils, and appear to be am|bitious only of finding opportunities to rail at all &s;tea|dy wi&s;dom, and to commit our intere&s;ts to pa&s;&s;ion and party.</P>
<P>The &s;ecrecy of negociations with foreign powers, through every &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s, is dictated by &s;ound policy. By making treaties public before they are ratified, advantages would often be lo&s;t, and by de&s;troying confidence and freedom of communication, the bu&s;ine&s;s would be often impeded or wholly defeat|ed. Nothing marks the &s;en&s;e of mankind on this &s;ubject, better than the practice of individuals, who
<PB N="200" REF="029752_0205_0FE2550A893302D0">
generally u&s;e &s;ecrecy in all important contracts of their own. This common practice is a proof of its utility. Much more nece&s;&s;ary is it in treaties, which are nati|onal contracts or conventions.</P>
<P>Another remark of <HI>Decius,</HI> worthy of notice, is, that the "fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions made by the treaty were unfa|vorable&mdash;all men and all <HI>ranks</HI> [what ranks? this writer has certainly forgotten one article of democracy&mdash;equality] united in condemning it."</P>
<P>This remark has &s;ome foundation, and the fact is ea&s;ily accounted for. The fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions on the minds of the public were made by an ab&s;tract of the treaty, which was publi&s;hed incorrectly, and there are &s;trong &s;u&s;picions that it was done with the in&s;idious view of exciting improper impre&s;&s;ions. The ab&s;tract was &s;aid to have been made from memory. This can|not be true. It is not in the power of man, after the mo&s;t careful peru&s;al, to make out &s;o large an ab&s;tract, without the help of notes, of twenty eight articles of a treaty, without intermixing the articles in the &s;ketch. The bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t have been done with de|&s;ign; and it was inexcu&s;able in any man to offer to the public a <HI>&s;ketch,</HI> much more an <HI>incorrect</HI> one, of &s;o important an in&s;trument.</P>
<P>The&s;e unfavorable impre&s;&s;ions, however, an&s;wered the views of men who perfectly well under&s;tood the importance of <HI>prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing</HI> the public mind They ex|cited a temporary clamor, and have perhaps made a few weak friends to an expiring cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But the clamer of the moment &s;ub&s;ided on reading a correct copy ot he treaty&mdash;men all agreed it was not &s;o bad as they expected. Still many well mean|ing people do not under&s;tand it; and every po&s;&s;ible effort is u&s;ed to di&s;tort and mi&s;con&s;true &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the treaty which affect the commerce of the coun|try</P>
<P>The violent cen&s;ure of the treaty which prevailed on its fir&s;t publication, in &s;keleton, and the moderati|on of the clamor on further peru&s;al of it, in&s;tead of
<PB N="201" REF="029752_0206_0FE2550C1946FA50">
being a proof that the treaty is in it&s;elf bad, is a &s;ut|&s;tantial argument in its favor&mdash;it is a proof that it bears examination&mdash;and it is a proof, further, of what we &s;hould all regret, that the <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> of men out&s;trip their <HI>judgment.</HI></P>
<P>Should the final re&s;ult of the bu&s;ine&s;s prove to be, what I am confident it will be, a general conviction that the treaty is, on the whole, a favorable one for the United States, and the mo&s;t favorable of any treaty we have yet formed; the public will view with indignation, the in&s;idious attempts that have been made to excite a ferment, and oppo&s;ition to its ratifi|cation, as well as to load with unmerited cen&s;ure the able mini&s;ter who conducted the negociation.</P>

<HEAD>No. II.</HEAD>
<P>THE preamble of the treaty, &s;ays <HI>Decius,</HI> is not free from objections. It &s;tates that the differences; between the countries are to be terminated "without reference to the merits of their complaints." <HI>Decius</HI> &s;ays, the merits of the controver&s;y &s;hould never be lo&s;t &s;ight of. But when this expre&s;&s;ion is explained, I believe every candid man will ju&s;tify it in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. The <HI>merits of the complaints,</HI> in this in&s;tance, refer &s;olely to the que&s;tion, "which party fir&s;t violated the treaty of peace." On the fir&s;t opening of the neg|ciation between the mini&s;ters of the, two countries, this became an important point of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The American envoy alleged the fir&s;t breach of the trea|ty to be on the part of Great Britain, and mentioned the carrying away of the negroes.</P>
<P>The English mini&s;ter maintained that this was a violation of the treaty. As this &s;ubject has occa|&s;ioned as much altercation as any point between the two countries, and as the &s;ilence of the present treaty on that &s;ubject, is the ground of violent clamor, I will anticipate a con&s;ideration of this point, which would more properly fall under a &s;ub&s;equent; article.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="029752_0207_0FE255159C62D880">Whenever our mini&s;ters have urged the claim of re&s;titution or compen&s;ation for the negroes, the Bri|ti&s;h mini&s;try have, invariably, an&s;wered them with the following remarks:</P>
<P>"The negroes carried from America by the Bri|ti&s;h armies, were taken by the troops an their march|es through the country, or came in, by proclamation and put them&s;elves under our protection.</P>
<P>"The clau&s;e of the treaty on which you ground your claim is in the&s;e words&mdash;"his Britannic maje&s;ty &s;hall, with all conveinient &s;peed, and without cau&s;ing any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> e&s;truction, or carrying away <HI>any negroes</HI> or <HI>other proper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> of the <HI>American</HI> inhabitants, withdraw all his armies, &amp;c."</P>
<P>"By the laws of the American &s;tates negroes are con&s;idered as <HI>property</HI> as much as cattle; you claim them as <HI>property</HI> for the men who were their proprie|tors. By the laws of war, univer&s;ally admitted, every &s;pecies of moveable property found and taken in an enemy's country, becomes the property of the captors. By the &s;eizure and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the negroes, the Bri|ti&s;h armies became the rightful owners; the negroes were <HI>booty,</HI> as much as the hor&s;es and cattle taken by the &s;ame troops.</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;e an American boat loaded with goods, to be taken, on one of your rivers in the time of war, would not that boat and goods bt a fair prize? Sup|po&s;e a hor&s;e to &s;tray into the Briti&s;h lines and be tak|en, would not that hor&s;e belong to the captors? Could a claim be rea&s;onably interpo&s;ed for re&s;titution or compen&s;ation in the&s;e ca&s;es? Whether they were &s;educed or forced from the plantations, if they were <HI>property,</HI> that property, on their coming into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of the Briti&s;h army, was changed, according to all ihe laws of war.</P>
<P>"The clau&s;e of the treaty contemplates negroes which were <HI>American property</HI> at the date of the &s;tipu|lation. "Negroes or <HI>other</HI> property" are the words. But the negroes which our troops had taken in their
<PB N="203" REF="029752_0208_0FE255184DFEE6A8">
marches, or which had put them&s;elves under their protection, were not, at that time, the <HI>property</HI> of Americans.</P>
<P>"On this con&s;truction, which we hold to be the only rational one, that clau&s;e of the treaty will not maintain your claim. The treaty may include &s;laves which were within the Briti&s;h lines, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their American ma&s;ters; but there is no pretence that &s;uch were carried away by the Briti&s;h troops.</P>
<P>"Be&s;ides, we cannot &s;urrender negroes which came into our lines on the faith of proclamations, without a violation of that faith; which cannot be done. We promi&s;ed them freedom and protection&mdash;we gave them that freedom, and we mu&s;t protect them."</P>
<P>Such is the &s;ub&s;tance of the mini&s;try's reply, to the claims of our envoy, which were repeatedly urged without &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;And the Briti&s;h mini&s;try have inva|riably put the &s;ame con&s;truction on that clau&s;e of the treaty of peace. Indeed it &s;eems difficult to an&s;wer this rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>Either the negroes were <HI>&s;laves</HI> and <HI>property,</HI> or they were not. If they were &s;laves and property, as con|&s;idered by the laws of mo&s;t of the American &s;tates, the Briti&s;h had the &s;ame right to &s;eize and carry them away as booty, as they had to &s;eize and carry away hor&s;es and cattle; a right of war that was never di&s;|puted. In this ca&s;e, the property was changed the moment they came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h armies, and at the date of the treaty, they were <HI>not</HI> American property, and con&s;equently <HI>not</HI> included in the &s;tipulation of the treaty.</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, the negroes were <HI>freemen,</HI> they had a right to put them&s;elves under Briti&s;h pro|tection, and we have no &s;hadow of claim to re&s;tituti|on or compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>I am one who believe that no property can be ob|tained in human &s;le&s;h, and any law authori&s;ing the purcha&s;e and detention of a human being, as <HI>property,</HI> is, ip&s;o facto, void.&mdash;Should this po&s;ition be well
<PB N="204" REF="029752_0209_0FE25519DBEE4C90">
founded, we have not a &s;hadow of preten&s;ion to the negroes carried away by the Briti&s;h troops.</P>
<P>But the laws of many of the &s;tates do con&s;ider them as property: whether rightfully or wrongful|ly, is not now the que&s;tion. If we con&s;ider them as <HI>property,</HI> they are to be ranked among <HI>per&s;onal</HI> e&s;|tates, for they certainy are not <HI>real</HI> e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Now Mr. Jeffer&s;on, a man of eminent talents, and the oracle of my antagoni&s;ts, admits, in the fulle&s;t extent, the doctrine, that all per&s;onal e&s;tate is right|fully &s;eizable by enemies in war. The following are his words:&mdash;</P>
<P>"It cannot be denied, that the &s;tate of war &s;tictly admits a nation to &s;eize the property of its enemies, found within its own limits, or taken in war, and in whatever form it exi&s;ts&mdash;whether in action or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on."</P>
<P>In confirmation of this, he quotes Bynker&s;hoek, l. 1. c. 7. who is clear and explicit on the &s;ubject. See papers relative to Great Britain, publi&s;hed by order of congre&s;s, p. 29. This doctrine is the univer&s;al law of nations.</P>
<P>"As the towns and lands taken from the enemy, are called conque&s;ts, all <HI>moveable things</HI> con&s;titute the <HI>booty.</HI> The booty belongs to the &s;overeign." Vattel, b. 3. c. 9.</P>
<P>In the interpretation of treaties where there are two con&s;tructions, the one favorable, the other odious, that which is odious is always to be rejected: and what can be more odious than to con&s;true this article of the treaty, &s;o as to violate faith towards the wretched blacks, and render them back to the whips and &s;courges of &s;lavery?</P>
<P>At any rate, this point of the bu&s;ine&s;s the Briti&s;h mini&s;try will not yield, as the fir&s;t infraction of the treaty.</P>
<P>Then came the detention of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, which our mini&s;ter alleged to be a breach of the trea|ty, anterior to any violation on the part of the Unit|ed
<PB N="205" REF="029752_0210_0FE2551B6AFD5F00">
States.&mdash;Here was introduced the corre&s;pondence between Mr. Jeffer&s;on and Mr. Hammond, and Mr. Jeffer&s;on's rea&s;oning on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>To this the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter an&s;wered, by referring to dates of tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>The provi&s;ional articles between Great Britain and America, were &s;igned, November 30th, 1782, at Pa|ris; and notice of this was officially received by Sir Guy Carleton, April 5th, 1783. But the definitive, treaty was not &s;igned till September 3d, 1783, and the ratifications were not finally exchanged, till &s;ome time in 1784, though I do not know the day and month.</P>
<P>A treaty is binding on a nation from the moment of &s;ignature; but its ultimate validity depends on its pa&s;&s;ing through all the u&s;ual forms. According to the modern practice, the exchange of ratifications puts the &s;eal to the validity of a treaty, and gives it an effect from the time of &s;ignature.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h mini&s;try &s;tate that, ex gratia, or as a matter of convenience to the nation, orders were giv|en to Sir Guy Carleton to evacuate New-York, im|mediately on &s;igning the provi&s;ional articles in 1782. But they allege they were not bound to do this, un|til they had been notified of the ratification of tho&s;e articles by congre&s;s, which could not have been till the middle of the year 1784.</P>
<P>The demand made by the Baron Steuben, by or|der of General Wa&s;hington, of the &s;urrender of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, and the fir&s;t demand made, was by his letter to General Haldimand, dated Augu&s;t 2, 1783. At this time the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter could &s;carcely have heard whether congre&s;s had agreed to the treaty or not; much le&s;s could any orders have been &s;ent from them to Canada, for withdrawing the troops from the garri&s;on.</P>
<P>Admitting this fact, that the Briti&s;h mini&s;try were not <HI>bound</HI> by treaty to give orders for the troops to
<PB N="206" REF="029752_0211_0FE25526120EF0A8">
withdraw, until the treaty had gone through its u&s;ual forms, then the detention of the po&s;ts, till long af|ter they had been demanded by Baron Steuben, and perhaps as late as the demand of Colonel Hull, in Ju|ly, 1784, was ju&s;tifiable and authorized by the prac|tice of nations.</P>
<P>But long before this, congre&s;s had declared the carrying away of the negroes, an infraction of the treaty; and in May 1793 had &s;ent orders to our fo|reign mini&s;ters to remon&s;trate again&s;t this mea&s;ure and demand reparation.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of New-York, &s;o early as March 17, 1783, pa&s;&s;ed an act authorizing any citizen to bring actions of tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t any per&s;on who had occu|pied, or injured his e&s;tate, real or per&s;onal, within the power of the enemy. This was an expre&s;s violation of the 6th article of the treaty, which declares that no per&s;on &s;hall &s;uffer any lo&s;s or damage, or any pro|&s;ecution, on account of the part he had taken during the war. And Virginia, in December, 1783, pa&s;&s;ed an act, &s;u&s;pending executions on certain judgments, which materially affected Briti&s;h creditors. South Carolina in March 1784 followed, and pa&s;&s;ed an act &s;u&s;pending all actions, both Briti&s;h and American, for nine months.</P>
<P>The&s;e legal impediments to the recovery of old Briti&s;h debts, determined the mini&s;try <HI>not</HI> to &s;urren|der the po&s;ts, but to hold them as a &s;ecurity for the&s;e debts. And whatever clamor we may rai&s;e about this bu&s;ine&s;s, we may be a&s;&s;ured, that the we&s;tern po&s;ts will never be delivered peaceably, until the payment of tho&s;e debts has been amply &s;ecured.</P>
<P>I have been thus full in explaining what is meant by the <HI>merits of complaints,</HI> in tne preamble of the trea|ty, to &s;how, that our mini&s;ter was ju&s;tifiable pa&s;&s;ing over the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a point of extreme difficulty&mdash;a point which would have wa&s;ted time and embarra&s;&s;ed, perhaps defeated, the negociation. The que&s;tion of the <HI>fir&s;t infraction</HI> of the treaty of peace had been ably
<PB N="207" REF="029752_0212_0FE25527D509E8F8">
discu&s;&s;ed before; and at the clo&s;e of the controver&s;y, the parties were as remote from the probability of a|greement as when they began.</P>
<P>Neither party would yield the point to his antago|ni&s;t. The Briti&s;h mini&s;try, it is evidently known, are determined never to admit the carrying away the negroes to be an infraction of the treaty, and they are equally determined not to &s;urrender the we&s;tern po&s;ts without a guarantee for the payment of old debts.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, was it not prudent and wi&s;e to pa&s;s over the fir&s;t &s;ubjects of crimination, and proceed to an amicable adju&s;tment of all differences, if it could be done, without attempting to decide who fir&s;t in|fringed the treaty? I am per&s;uaded that every candid man who reads this explanation of the bu&s;ine&s;s, will be fully &s;atisfied with the conduct of our envoy.</P>
<P>[Note. I generally u&s;e the word envoy or mini&s;ter, in the &s;ingular, as referring to Mr. Jay, the principal in the negociation. But it is proper to ob&s;erve once for all, that Mr. Jay, by order, communicated his in&s;tructions to Mr. Pinckney, con&s;ulted him on every point, and that the treaty end every article of it had the approbation of that gentleman.]</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t article of the treaty contains words of cour&s;e, which de&s;erve no notice.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Article 2.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t objection made to this article is the inex|plicitne&s;s of it. It is &s;aid that the article &s;hould have defined from <HI>what places</HI> his maje&s;ty was to withdraw his troops.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer to this objection is, that there is not any di&s;pute about the boundary line of the United States, except at the north ea&s;t extremity, on St. Croix river. The po&s;ts which we claim are acknow|ledged to be in the United States. It is po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="208" REF="029752_0213_0FE255296562B590">
that Briti&s;h officers at &s;ome of tho&s;e places, as a pre|text for &s;ome purpo&s;es of their own, may have pre|tended they were on their own ground; but I never heard it &s;ugge&s;ted that the mini&s;try di&s;pute the boun|dary line, at or near any of the garri&s;oned places.</P>
<P>The time a&s;&s;igned for the evacuation, is &s;aid to be too di&s;tant. But if we calculate, we &s;hall find no ground for this objection. There was required time to exchange ratifications, and then for orders to be di&s;patched from England, to the farthe&s;t po&s;t we&s;t-ward.

<HEAD>Article 3.</HEAD>
<P>Even this article of the treaty, which breaks down the barriers which have hitherto ob&s;tructed our trade to Canada, and opens a general intercour&s;e upon mo&s;t liberal principles, has not e&s;caped critici&s;m and cen|&s;ure. <HI>Decius</HI> &s;ays, the advantages in this article are on the &s;ide of Great Britain; and the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned is, that the extent of the United States, is greater than that of the Briti&s;h territories. Now this is the very rea&s;on why the advantages of this article are in &s;avor of the United States.</P>
<P>What is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of trade between Canada and the United States? and what will its &s;ituation be
<PB N="209" REF="029752_0214_0FE2552AF3B4EC58">
under the treaty? This is a fair way of determining the goodne&s;s of the treaty.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, almo&s;t all trade is prohibited on the part of Canada.&mdash;Not a &s;kin in the fur trade can be brought into the United States except by &s;tealth. This prohibition makes the little trade in peltry, now actually carried on, very harard|ous, and rai&s;es the article to a very high price. The peltry, it mu&s;t be admitted, is almo&s;t <HI>all</HI> collected within the Briti&s;h territories; the Briti&s;h have com|mand of it by right; and the removal of tho&s;e garri|&s;ons to the other &s;ide of the lakes, without a removal of the prohibition on the peltry trade, would not have been of much advantage to the United States.</P>
<P>We have then every thing to gain by a free inter|cour&s;e&mdash;the Briti&s;h, every thing to lo&s;e, &s;o far as re|gards <HI>that trade.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Decius</HI> &s;ays, "the fur trade will probably fall alto|gether in the hands of Briti&s;h traders." This is a mo&s;t extraordinary &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The truth is, the peltry trade now is all IN their hands&mdash;What we want is to get that OUT of their hands. That is, we want to obtain a &s;hare of that trade on equal terms with Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. This we have obtained by the article under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>What right, what pretence have we to a monopoly of that trade? Do we expect that Great Britain would permit us, as <HI>Decius</HI> &s;ays, "to &s;ecure to our|&s;elves the whole fur trade?" To demand &s;uch a privi|lege on our part would be extravagant and ridiculous.</P>
<P>The trade by the third article of the treaty, is placed on a fair and liberal footing.&mdash;Both parties are free to u&s;e all the rivers and lakes for the purpo&s;e of inland navigation, &s;ubject only to the common tolls and ferriages. The exception of the limits of the Hud&s;on's Bay company is of no importance at pre&s;ent to the United States; and the exception was a nece&s;|&s;ary

con&s;equence of the exclu&s;ive rights of the com|pany.</P>

But <HI>Decius</HI> will plea&s;e to recollect, that this privilege enjoyed by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and the re&s;triction of American &s;ubjects, are not created by the pre&s;ent treaty. In this re&s;pect the parties are as they were before. American ve&s;&s;els have never been per|mitted to carry on the coa&s;ting trade of the Briti&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in America; and therefore we &s;uffer no new abridgment of bu&s;ine&s;s by this article. On the other hand, Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els are <HI>now</HI> admitted into all our harbours, and to the highe&s;t port of entry for fo|reign ve&s;&s;els, &s;o that this article gives no new privi|lege to &s;uch ve&s;&s;els. But we have obtained by the treaty a <HI>fret inland trade with Canada.</HI> We can na|vigate all the rivers and lakes&mdash;we can go down the St. Lawrence to Quebec. Articles are to be carried from the United States to Canada, and vice ver&s;a, &s;ubject to the lowe&s;t duties ever paid on the&s;e articles;&mdash;and peltry pays no duty at all.</P>
<P>This free intercour&s;e will be highly advantageous to our citizens on the frontiers. They will be deeply concerned in the fur trade, and we &s;hall obtain furs much lower than formerly. At the &s;ame time the inhabitants on our frontiers will find a market at Mon|treal or Quebec, and bring back in return &s;uch heavy articles as will come cheaper, through the St. Law|rence and the lakes, than through the Atlantic ports.</P>
<P>This trade is extremely wanted by our frontier &s;et|tlements, which are every day increa&s;ing. Their di&s;|tance from the Atlantic lays them under heavy di&s;ad|vantages, which the treaty before us alleviates, as much as po&s;&s;ible, by taking off all re&s;trictions on in|land trade. And ju&s;t in proportion to the numbar

of people in the United States, who are to carry on and partake of that free trade, will be the benefits of this article of the treaty.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be con&s;idered further, that the citizens of the United States are taking up large tracts of land in Canada, and emigrating to that province.&mdash;This bu&s;ine&s;s is encouraged by the Briti&s;h govern|ment. But while the people who &s;ettle in Canada, for the purpo&s;es of trade or agriculture, become &s;ubjects of Great Britain, they retain their attachment to the United States; and from this circum&s;tance important and beneficial con&s;equences may hereafter be expected.</P>

<HEAD>Article 6.</HEAD>
<P>This is a mo&s;t important article. It involves in it the primary and principal cau&s;es of all the differences now exi&s;ting between the two countries.</P>
<P>Before the war, mo&s;t of the trade of Virginia, and a great portion of that of the &s;tates to the &s;outh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ard, was carried on by foreigners. I am well a&s;&s;ured that it was e&s;teemed in Virginia, di&s;reputable for planters and their &s;ons to engage in trade. This prejudice, which was, like a thou&s;and follies adopted by Ame|ricans, introduced from Europe, and a remnant of the aristocracy of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, operated powerfully to keep trade in the hands of foreigners.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h merchants availed them&s;elves of the prejudice. They were the agents or factors for the pianters, and gave exten&s;ive credit. The confidence created by this friendly intercour&s;e, together with the prodigal habits of many planters, extended this cre|dit to a very large amount.</P>
<P>The war nece&s;&s;arily &s;u&s;pended the payment of the&s;e debts. The treaty of peace provided that no lawful impediments &s;hould be interpo&s;ed to prevent the re|covery
<PB N="212" REF="029752_0217_0FE25537EB132920">
of tho&s;e debts. The carrying away of the negroes by the Briti&s;h, when they left New York, exa&s;perated the &s;outhern &s;tates: they con&s;idered it as an infraction of the treaty, and, as &s;uch, an excu&s;e for violating it on their part. They pa&s;&s;ed laws which ware impediments to the recovery of old debts. The Briti&s;h mini&s;try, on their part, detained the we&s;tern po&s;ts, as &s;ecurity for tho&s;e debts, and damages <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the Briti&s;h merchants, in con&s;equence of tho&s;e legal impediments. Here the parties are at i&s;|&s;ue here are differences between the two nations which can be &s;ettled only by the &s;word or amicable adju&s;tment.</P>
<P>This is preci&s;ely the &s;ituation of the parties.&mdash;Neither party will yield the point of <HI>fir&s;t infraction;</HI> and paper, corre&s;pondence, to prove the point, has been exhau&s;ted, without giving any &s;atisfaction to either.</P>
<P>The i&s;&s;ue then is, the alternative of <HI>war</HI> or <HI>accom|modation.</HI> But if we enter into a war, will this &s;et|tle the points in di&s;pute? Not at all. A ten years war, and a wa&s;te of half the blood and trea&s;ure of the United States, would leave the cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">er&s;y ju&s;t where it now is&mdash;to be &s;ettled by negociation.</P>
<P>It is no an&s;wer to the&s;e remarks, to make outcries about Briti&s;h inju&s;tice. Admitting this in the fulle&s;t extent, that inju&s;tice is to be re&s;trained only by the &s;word, or amicable agreement&mdash;we have our choice.</P>
<P>Is it not prudent and wi&s;e to make an effort to ad|ju&s;t all differences by a reference to equitable princi|ples? What better mode could be devi&s;ed to &s;ettle dif|ferences &s;o numerous, &s;o complicated, as tho&s;e which exi&s;t between the two countries, than by commi&s;&s;ion|ers fairly and impartially appointed? This is the mode which has been practi&s;ed for centuries, in like ca&s;es. In looking into collections of treaties, I find the &s;ame mode pre&s;cribed in all ca&s;es of difficult di&s;|putes between nations; and the univer&s;al practice of
<PB N="213" REF="029752_0218_0FE255398B049E20">
re&s;orting to this mode, is a proof that none better has yet been devi&s;ed.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, "this mode of adju&s;ting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> due to Briti&s;h creditors, is unju&s;t towards tho&s;e &s;tates which have interpo&s;ed no lawful impediments in the way of recovering &s;uch debts; as they mu&s;t bear a part of the burden, and thus &s;uffer for the delinquen|cy of others."</P>
<P>This objection is &s;u&s;ceptible of a very &s;atisfactory an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Our capacity, as a nation, ari&s;es from the union of the &s;tates under the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>All our intercour&s;e with foreign nations is conduct|ed by the <HI>United States,</HI> in that national capacity. Foreign nations cannot negociate with any of our individual &s;tates; and the &s;tates are expre&s;sly prohi|bited, by our con&s;titution, from entering into any treaty, compact, or agreement, with any foreign power.</P>
<P>The moment our union took place, the United States became, to a certain degree, re&s;pon&s;ible for acts done by &s;tates or individuals towards foreign na|tions. This re&s;pon&s;ibility re&s;ults from the national capacity derived from the union.</P>
<P>Whatever hard&s;hips this may impo&s;e on particular &s;tates, it is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the character we have a&s;&s;umed among the powers of the earth; and indeed it is much more than counterbalanced by the protection and &s;ecurity derived from the &s;ame nation|al capacity.</P>

<P>THIS article is &s;aid to be wholly exceptionable, becau&s;e it places at too great a di&s;tance, compen&s;ation to which our citizens are entitled, for the mo&s;t atro|cious acts of piracy.</P>
<P>I will admit what my antagoni&s;ts plea&s;e to allege again&s;t the injurious treatment of our ve&s;&s;els at &s;ea by Briti&s;h privateers. I know that the right which the
<PB N="214" REF="029752_0219_0FE25541E009A130">
law of nations gives to powers at war, of &s;topping and examining neutral ve&s;&s;els, and &s;eizing them when they have contraband goods on boards, has been abu&s;|ed, and that great injuries and in&s;olence have been &s;uffered by our &s;eamen; and great lo&s;&s;es have been incurred by our merchants by illegal detention and condemnation. My own feelings are keenly alive to &s;uch abu&s;es, and I wi&s;h we had the means of vindicat|ing our rights in a more ample manner.</P>
<P>But let me ob&s;erve, that the&s;e injuries do not ex|cite greater re&s;entment in the brea&s;ts of Americans, than laws of our &s;tates, &s;u&s;pending the recovery of old debts, or making lands, goods and depreciated paper currency, a legal tender for the&s;e debts, awak|ened in the brea&s;ts of the Briti&s;h nation. As to &eacute;|very thing of this nature, anger, re&s;entment and di&s;|gu&s;t are reciprocal: and ill u&s;age alleged on one part, is retorted with ill u&s;age in &s;ome other particular on the other part. There is no common tribunal, to de|cide this que&s;tion, Who has been guilty of the great|e&s;t outrage on faith and hone&s;ty? We are &s;atisfied that the charge belongs to Great Britain&mdash;<HI>they</HI> are as confident the blame is on our &s;ide. It is idle to wa&s;te time in criminating each other&mdash;Our intere&s;t and hap|pine&s;s, and tho&s;e of Great Britain, demand an ami|cable accommodation, and to that point all our ef|forts &s;hould be directed.</P>
<P>The time which will be required to examine the claims of American merchants for lo&s;&s;es, is certainly to be regretted. But how cau this delay be pre|vented?</P>
<P>If we admit the right of powers at war to &s;top neutral ve&s;&s;els and examine them, a right which has never been di&s;puted, do we not admit the right of a&s;|certaining whether &s;uch ve&s;&s;els have contraband pro|perty on board or not? How &s;hall this point be &s;et|tled, where &s;u&s;picion occurs? The papers of neutral ve&s;&s;els are not always to be relied on. We all know that &s;ubjects of nations at war, procure neutral ve&s;|&s;el
<PB N="215" REF="029752_0220_0FE255448D821D58">
&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and neutral names to cover property of their own&mdash;This happens every day. We all know that con|traband goods are often concealed in bales or ca&s;ks of goods not contraband. We all know that ma&s;ters, &s;upercargoes and &s;eamen, will evade direct an&s;wers, equivocate, and &s;ometimes men are abandoned enough to perjure them&s;elves in a court, to &s;ave property of their own or their friends.</P>
<P>What &s;ays the law of nations on this &s;ubject? Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tel, b. 3. ch. 7. lays it down with great preci&s;ion. "Without &s;earching neutral &s;hips at &s;ea, the com|merce of contraband goods cannot be prevented. There is then a right of &s;earching. At pre&s;ent a neutral &s;hip refu&s;ing to be &s;earched, would from that proceeding alone be condemned as lawful prize. But to avoid inconveniencies, violence, and every other ir|regularity, the manner of the &s;earch is &s;ettled in the treaties of navigation and commerce. According to the pre&s;ent cu&s;tom, credit is to be given to certificates and bills of lading, produced by the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip, <HI>unle&s;s any fraud appear in them, or there be very good rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect their validity."</HI></P>
<P>The mode of &s;earching neutral ve&s;&s;els is regulated by our treaties, with the States General, with Swe|den and France, in which it is &s;tipulated that credit &s;hall be given to the &s;hips' papers. But we have had no &s;uch treaty with Great Britain, and the treat|ment of our ve&s;&s;els depends on the law of nations, or the licentious will of the ma&s;ters of privateers.&mdash;Wherever there is &s;u&s;picion of fraud in the papers, the ve&s;&s;els may, by the law of nations, be carried into port for examination and trial; and it is probable, this licen&s;e has been carried to a mo&s;t unwarrantable length, during the pre&s;ent war. The general ex|pre&s;&s;ion, <HI>cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion,</HI> gives an almo&s;t unbound|ed latitude to tho&s;e unprincipled men, who are u&s;ual|ly engaged in the dete&s;table bu&s;ine&s;s of privateering. Such is the &s;ituation of our trade, in the pre&s;ent unhappy war. But making every allowance for ill
<PB N="216" REF="029752_0221_0FE255461B4DCAB8">
u&s;age, it mu&s;t be admitted that great numbers of A|merican ve&s;&s;els have, according to the laws of nations, been ju&s;tly &s;eized, and carried into port for trial.&mdash;When this is the ca&s;e, what mode of proce&s;s mu&s;t be had to determine what property is liable to confi&s;cati|on, and what is not?</P>
<P>Our exi&s;ting treaties with other nations admit the right of trial in the admiralty courts of the nation capturing the neutral ve&s;&s;els; and in the&s;e treaties, there are &s;tipulations that bulk &s;hall not be broke, un|til the cargo has been landed in pre&s;ence of proper officers, and no part of the cargo &s;old, till legal pro|ce&s;s &s;hall have been had, and &s;entence pronounced a|gain&s;t the goods liable to condemnation.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t not the &s;ame proce&s;s be had in the Briti&s;h courts, though we have had no treaty with the nati|on? Where is the ground for maintaining a different doctrine?</P>
<P>We mu&s;t then admit the principle, that American ve&s;&s;els &s;eized and carried into port, with prohibited goods on board, or on &s;u&s;picion of fraudulent papers, are &s;ubject to the u&s;ual legal proce&s;s of Briti&s;h courts of admiralty. However hard this may appear, the ef|fect flows directly from the &s;tate of war and the law of nations.</P>
<P>If we admit this principle, we admit all its con&s;e|quences. If our ve&s;&s;els are liable to legal proce&s;s, it is nece&s;&s;ary that all the documents relative to the que&s;tion of <HI>legal capture or not,</HI> &s;hould be produced and examined. And when we con&s;ider the di&s;tance from which many of the&s;e documents are to be pro|cured, and the numerous ca&s;es that have ari&s;en, who can &s;ay that final deci&s;ions can be had on the Ameri|can claims in a moment? And in ca&s;es which involve equitable con&s;iderations, not proper for the deci&s;ion of courts of law, what mode could be devi&s;ed, more eligible for the claimants, than that of commi&s;&s;ion|ers? Is the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m of eighteen months too long for receiving claims? It appears to me the time is not
<PB N="217" REF="029752_0222_0FE25547ACE22878">
unrea&s;onably long; and even the length of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is favorable for the claimants.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that the Briti&s;h government ought to ad|vance a &s;um on account, to be di&s;tributed among the &s;ufferers. This &s;ugge&s;tion &s;eems to be grounded on an idea that has prevailed, that &s;uch a &s;um has been advanced by Great Britain to Denmark and Sweden&mdash;an opinion which, I have authority to &s;ay, is not well founded.</P>
<P>But to this mea&s;ure there are in&s;urmountable ob|jections. The impracticability of doing even partial ju&s;tice, before it is a&s;certained who are the objects of it, is merely chimerical.</P>
<P>Many of my countrymen are great &s;ufferers, and I tru&s;t their ju&s;t claims will be &s;upported, and their ju&s;t damages paid. But a &s;ummary trial might do great inju&s;tice&mdash;the innocent might &s;uffer, and the guilty obtain reparation.</P>
<P>On the whole, the time and mode appear as eligi|ble, as ju&s;tice and the nature of the ca&s;es will admit.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;tipulation in the la&s;t clau&s;e of the 7th article, that engages payment for certain ve&s;|&s;els taken by privateers within our juri&s;diction or by ve&s;&s;els armed in our ports, I tru&s;t no man, who has a regard for hone&s;ty or national character, will ever ob|ject to it. I am one of tho&s;e American citizens, that hold it as a duty for us to pre&s;erve a &s;trict neu|trality in the pre&s;ent war, and honorable in our go|vernment to make indemnification for every illegal proceeding of the nation and of individuals, towards foreign nations. Let him who demands ju&s;tice, do ju&s;tice him&s;elf. The amount of the &s;ums to be paid, does not vary the principle, nor &s;hould it vary our con|duct as a nation. I hope and tru&s;t the character of the United States, will never be &s;tained with a viola|tion of faith and ju&s;tice, even towards the con&s;airs of Barbary. Self-defence, only, will authorise any na|tion in arre&s;ting or withholding the property of indi|viduals

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honor to &s;end you herein inclo&s;ed, the copy of a letter, which has been addre&s;&s;ed to me by Citizen Po&s;tic, a lawyer re&s;iding at Morlai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. It appears, that in the proceedings of which he has giv|en an account, there are extraordinary irregularities; and I think it my duty to inform you of them, as on the ju&s;tice of tribunals often depends the &s;alvation, and always the pro&s;perity of a &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="029752_0224_0FE25553D6688E98">I reque&s;t of you at the &s;ame time, Sir, to permit me to make two general ob&s;ervations on the whole of this bu&s;ine&s;s; one of which applies to the organiza|tion, and the other to the proceedings, of the com|mercial tribunals. The referring of que&s;tions on &s;ea prizes, to the&s;e tribunals, appears to me dangerous &s;ince they involve the interpretation of the Treaties, and the application of the law of nations: con&s;e|quently of peace and of war. Now we may be per|mitted to entertain &s;ome doubt as to the knowledge of the judges, and we ought be&s;ides to fear, le&s;t they may be intere&s;ted, as owners of privateers, in the que&s;tions which are &s;ubmitted to them.</P>
<P>But whatever may be the organization of the tri|bunals, it appears to me e&s;&s;ential, Sir, that in their proceedings they &s;hould receive all the claims which may be made to them; that they &s;hould even invite without waiting for the authority of the per&s;ons in|tere&s;ted, who are often at the di&s;tance of one thou|&s;and leagues. The juri&s;diction of the tribunals with|in who&s;e cognizance are the que&s;tions of prize, is in rem. They take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the things, and by that means render them&s;elves re&s;pon&s;ible for it. Now as the tribunal, which is the depo&s;itory of the thing, ought not to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of it, without a formal authoritative act of the true proprietor, it is their duty, not only to admit, but al&s;o to &s;eek proofs, which may e&s;tabli&s;h to whom the property truly be|longs. This is a double duty towards the neutral proprietor, and towards their own nation: for every government which permits its citizens to fit out pri|vateers, arms with the de&s;tructive &s;word of war, hands which are intere&s;ted to extend its ravages, and renders it&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible for the abu&s;es which re&s;ult from &s;o dangerous a delegation of &s;overeignty. For the pur|po&s;e of repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them, the admiralty tribunals have been e&s;tabli&s;hed throughout the different nations of Europe. In the&s;e tribunals, the government furni&s;hes the means of information, by the facility with which

it admits therein every &s;pecies of claim.

<HEAD>Extract from the French Mini&s;ter's an&s;wer to Mr. Morris, dated Paris, Oct. 14, 1793.</HEAD>
<P>"THESE ob&s;ervations, Sir, which you are too ju&s;t not to appreciate, apply to the greater part of the claims, which you have addre&s;&s;ed to me for &s;ome time. I have done with re&s;pect to &s;everal of them, all that depended on me, in order to obtain in &s;avor of your countrymen, an exception of the general mea&s;ures, adopted with regard to neutral nations. I have u&s;ed among others, all the means with which your letters furni&s;hed me, to have re&s;tored the &s;hip Laurens; but I have met with in&s;urmountable ob|&s;tacles, in the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, and in the opinion of the commercial tribunal at Havre. The tribunal has neglected nothing to render ju&s;tice to the owners of this ve&s;&s;el. It has con&s;ented among other things, to have tran&s;lated 361 letters, merely to prove in the mo&s;t authentic manner, the property of the cargo. The intere&s;ted have, be&s;ides, avowed them&s;elves, that they had neglected an e&s;&s;ential formality required by our laws.</P>

It mu&s;t perceive how difficult it is, to contain within ju&s;t limits, the indignation of our marines, and in general of all the French patriots, again&s;t a people who &s;peak the &s;ame language, and have the &s;ame habits, as the free Americans.

<HEAD>Article 9.</HEAD>
<P>This article gives the pre&s;ent holders of lands in the two countries the right of di&s;po&s;ing of them, &amp;c. without being con&s;idered as aliens.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t ab&s;tract of the treaty which was publi&s;h|ed, this article was erroneou&s;ly &s;tated, as extending
<PB N="222" REF="029752_0227_0FE255611FB460F8">
to give the rights of citizens to any and all Briti&s;h &s;ubjects purcha&s;ing lands hereafter in the United States. The truth is, the article extends only to per|&s;ons holding lands at the time the treaty was &s;igned, and &s;ome provi&s;ion of this kind was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>To under&s;tand this article, it mu&s;t be remembered, that the United States were &s;ettled from the Briti&s;h dominions, and till lately remained a part of the na|tion. Some per&s;ons in the United States now hold lands in England, which they inherit from branches of their families which are extinct in that country. Great numbers in the Briti&s;h dominions hold lands which they formerly enjoyed as inhabitants of the colonies, and which were not confi&s;cated. Others have been compelled to take lands in payment of debts.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of the&s;e two countries differ from tho&s;e of all other countries. They were formerly <HI>one country,</HI> and linked together by a variety of individual intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>The&s;e private intere&s;ts have been mo&s;tly created un|der one common government. They originated, when the two countries were one in empire, and without any fault on the part of the per&s;ons intere&s;ted. Was it not rea&s;onable and ju&s;t, that intere&s;ts thus created &s;hould be &s;ecured by the provi&s;ions of a treaty which was to adju&s;t all old differences? Mo&s;t certainly it was.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that this article infringes the rights of the &s;tates. As I have never &s;een any argument to prove this a&s;&s;ertion, it will be &s;ufficient to an&s;wer it by another a&s;&s;ertion, and &s;ay it does <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;aid al&s;o that this article impairs the obligation of private contracts. As this is a&s;&s;erted without ex|planation or proof, it wili be pa&s;&s;ed without notice.</P>
<P>The danger of aliens holding real e&s;tate in any country, is an idea that was propagated ever Europe|in feudal times, and modern writers on law have con|tinued to tran&s;cribe the rea&s;oning on that &s;ubject, from
<PB N="223" REF="029752_0228_0FE25562B060A0D8">
one generation to another, as they have on u&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y, in|tolerance, natural allegiance, and many other ancient errors, without allowing for the ameliorated &s;tate of &s;ociety and civil policy. The danger, however, is now a mere bug bear, and de&s;erves notice. Men may hold real e&s;tates, without the other privileges of citizens; and it tends to promote commerce to admit foreigners to this privilege, under &s;uitable re&s;trictions.</P>
<P>The only danger that now exi&s;ts in an unlimited privilege of this kind is, that per&s;ons might po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of large e&s;tates, and &s;pend the income abroad, as is the ca&s;e with the planters in the We&s;t Indies and the Iri&s;h nobility. Should this ever become an evil of extent, it will require legi&s;lative remedies.</P>
<P>But it is an important idea which the United States &s;hould cheri&s;h, that men are never enemies to a free country. Men may &s;cramble for offices, and oppo&s;e the admini&s;tration of a government from &s;elfi&s;h views&mdash;but if foreigners find peace, liberty, and &s;afety in our country, they will hardly give them&s;elves the trouble of &s;ubjecting us to other governments. A liberality in our mea&s;ures towards foreigners, &s;trict ju&s;tice and impartiality in our laws, will make all par|ties our friends, and this is one great object of the pre&s;ent treaty.</P>
<P><HI>Decius</HI> attempts to make an invidious compari&s;on between this article of the treaty, and the eleventh ar|ticle of our treaty with France, which, he &s;ays, is all in &s;avor of the Americans, becau&s;e it aboli&s;hes the droit d'aub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine in their favor, and gives the French nothing which the law of nations did not &s;ecure them before. To prove this he goes into a <HI>common law</HI> ex|planation of the terms u&s;ed in the French treaty&mdash;<HI>goods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oveable</HI> and <HI>immoveable.</HI>&mdash;The words of the eleventh article of the treaty with France are, "The &s;ubjects and inhabitants of the United States &s;hall not be reputed aubains, in France,&mdash;they may di&s;po&s;e of their goods, moveable and immoveable, by te&s;ta|ment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, &amp;c."&mdash;<HI>Immoveable goods, Decius</HI> &s;ays,
<PB N="224" REF="029752_0229_0FE2556442CD0A80">
mean chattels real, but not e&s;tates in &s;ee, and quotes Sir Edward Coke and Black&s;tone.</P>
<P>If <HI>Decius</HI> is a lawyer of great ingenuity, as he doubtle&s;s is, he ought to be very cautious to conceal his &s;ubtilties. His far-fetched arguments to make the French treaty a mere act of benevolence on the part of Louis XVI. and the pre&s;ent <HI>treaty</HI> a mere &s;a|crifice on our part, will not, ultimately, &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>The explanation given by <HI>Decius</HI> to the terms <HI>im|moveable goods</HI> is unequivocally wrong. Does not <HI>Decius</HI> know, that a treaty with France is not to be interpreted by the common law of England? Does not he know that the terms <HI>bona immobilia,</HI> immove|able goods, are borrowed from the <HI>civil law,</HI> that the civil law is the ba&s;is of almo&s;t every municipal con&s;titution in Europe? Does he not recollect that the municipal laws of France were derived from that &s;ource, and that terms u&s;ed in that country are to be explained by the civil law? Is not a treaty with France to be interpreted according to the legal import of the words in that country?</P>
<P>Let <HI>Decius</HI> then be apprized, that <HI>bona immobilia</HI> is a technical phra&s;e as old as the civil law, and that it comprehended formerly and &s;till comprehends, in mo&s;t countries of Europe, real e&s;tate, that is, a freehold e&s;tate, and lands in fee, as well as chattels, real. When u&s;ed by writers on the law of nations, the phra&s;e has that &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>"Every &s;tate has the liberty of granting or refu&s;|ing foreigners the power of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing lands or other <HI>immoveable goods,</HI> within its territory."&mdash;Vattel, b. 2. ch. 8. In the &s;ame page are the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions: "If the &s;overeign does not permit aliens to po&s;&s;e&s;s im|moveables, no one has a right to complain of it, as the &s;overeign may refu&s;e &s;trangers the power of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing immoveables." So al&s;o in b. 3. ch. 5. &s;ec, 76.</P>
<P>The foregoing paragraph relates to moveable goods, but the rule is different with regard to <HI>immoveables,</HI> to <HI>&s;tates in lands,</HI> as they all in &s;ome mea&s;ure belong to

the nation, are part of its domain, &amp;c. and the pro|prietor being always a &s;ubject of the country as po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or of a parcel of <HI>land,</HI> and <HI>goods</HI> of <HI>this nature</HI> do not cea&s;e to be the enemy's goods, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a neutral &s;tranger. "Neverthele&s;s, war being now carried on with &s;o much moderation and indulgence, &s;afe-guards are allowed to <HI>hou&s;es and lands</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by foreigners in an enemy's country. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, he who declares war does not confi&s;cate the <HI>immoveable goods</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in his country by his ene|my's &s;ubjects. In permitting them to purcha&s;e and po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>tho&s;e goods,</HI> he has, in this re&s;pect, admitted them into the number of his &s;ubjects. But the income may be &s;eque&s;trated, for hindering the remittance of it to the enemy's country."</P>
<P>Bynker&s;hoek, Que&s;t. Jur. Pub. 1. c. 7. u&s;es the word <HI>immobilia</HI> in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, and lays down the doctrine above quoted from Vattel.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t direct authority in point, is from Do|mat's Civil Law, Preliminary Book, title 3. &s;ect. 1.&mdash;the following pa&s;&s;age is expre&s;s: "Immoveables are all the parts of the &s;urface of the earth, in what man|ner &s;oever they are di&s;tingui&s;hed, whether into places for buildings, or into woods, meadow, arable lands, vineyards, orchards, or otherwi&s;e, and to whom&s;oever they belong."</P>
<P>In &s;ect. 2. of the &s;ame title, Domat expre&s;sly enu|merates lands, whether <HI>allodial</HI> or charged with quit rents, among <HI>immoveables.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It de&s;erves remark, that the French word <HI>biens,</HI> goods, com|prehends e&s;tate in land. This &s;en&s;e is borrowed from the ci|vil</NOTE> As this writer was a French civilian, he doubtle&s;s u&s;ed the word in its tech|nical &s;en&s;e, as under&s;tood in France, and by this &s;en&s;e mu&s;t our treaty with France be interpreted. Indeed, whatever may be the opinion of lawyers here, I have no doubt that, by the 11th article of that treaty, French citizens are fully entitled to hold real e&s;tate law.
<PB N="226" REF="029752_0231_0FE255702AE44920">
in the United States, and American citizens, in France.</P>
<P>In all our other treaties, the article in que&s;tion re|&s;tricts the &s;ubjects of the two countries, to the enjoy|ment of <HI>per&s;onal e&s;tate or effects,</HI> in the juri&s;diction each of the other. Mo&s;t nations retain the old feudal jea|lou&s;y re&s;pecting foreigners po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing lands in their countries. But the liberality of France, in her trea|ty with America, ought to be an example to all na|tions; and the United States, of all countries on earth, ought to reject all &s;uch remains of feudal pre|judice. I tru&s;t the explanation before given of the terms <HI>immoveable goods,</HI> will be &s;atisfactory; and will evince the truth of what was advanced by the writer of "Candid Remarks on the Treaty," that the 11th article of our treaty with France amounts to a <HI>total abolition of ali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;m,</HI> between the two countries.</P>
<P>Unle&s;s <HI>Decius</HI> &s;ucceeds better hereafter in "detect|ing fallacies," he may as well let his pen re&s;t, or em|ploy it more to his own reputation. His writings on the &s;ubject, &s;o far as they have hitherto appeared, are little more than a &s;eries of mi&s;repre&s;entation.</P>

<P>THE 10th article of the treaty provides that "nei|ther the debts due from individuals of the one nation to individuals of the other, nor &s;hares nor monies which they may have in the public funds, or in the public banks, &s;hall ever in any event of war or nati|onal differences be &s;eque&s;tered or confi&s;cated," The faithful observance of the re&s;triction contained in this article is &s;o much for our intere&s;t as well as honor, that we &s;hould naturally have concluded, the mo&s;t determined enemies to any good under&s;tanding with Great-Britain, would at lea&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed it by in &s;i|lence. But &s;o &s;trong are the prejudices of a certain party among&s;t us, or &s;o virulent their pa&s;&s;ions, that they have given to almo&s;t every paragraph in the trea|ty
<PB N="227" REF="029752_0232_0FE25571B8B8F348">
an equal condemnation. Decius has complained of this article as being, like many others, exclu&s;ively advantageous to England, and as arre&s;ting from our government a lawful and powerful weapon of war. I am greatly mi&s;taken, however, if it is not completely defen&s;ible again&s;t every part of this accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>It is true that by the law of nations, as exi&s;ting a century ago, the debts owing from one nation to ano|ther were legal objects of &s;eque&s;tration in war. "But ar pre&s;ent (to u&s;e the language of Vattel, b. 3. ch. 5. &s;ec. 77.) in regard to the advantage and &s;afety of commerce, all the &s;overeigns of Europe have departed from this rigor.&mdash;And as this <HI>cu&s;tom has been gene|rally received,</HI> he who &s;hould act contrary to it would <HI>injure the public faith;</HI> for &s;trangers tru&s;ted his &s;ub|jects only from a firm per&s;ua&s;ion that the <HI>general cu&s;tom</HI> would be ob&s;erved. The &s;tate does not &s;o much as touch the &s;ums which it owes to the enemy. Every where, in ca&s;e of a war, funds credited to the public, are exempt from confi&s;cation and &s;eizure." This clear explanation of the modern law of nations, as far as it relates to the public funds, is al&s;o to be found in a report of the Engli&s;h judges in the year 1753, in an&s;wer to the Pru&s;&s;ian memorial; a report of much authority, which Vattel does not &s;cruple to call an excellent piece on the law of nations. "It will not be ea&s;y, &s;ay the judges, to find an in&s;tance where a prince has thought fit to make repri&s;als upon a debt due from him&s;elf to private men. There is a confidence that this will not be done. A private man &s;ends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to a prince upon the faith of an engagement of honor, becau&s;e a prince cannot be compelled, like other men, in an adver&s;e way, by a court of ju&s;tice, So &s;crupulou&s;ly did England, France and Spain adhere to this pub|lic faith, that, even during the war, they &s;uffered no enquiry to be made whether any part of the public debts was due to &s;ubjects of the enemy, though it is certain many Engli&s;h had money in the French funds and many French had money in ours."</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="029752_0233_0FE255734E051898">But the&s;e principles have received &s;anction from a &s;ource, which the adver&s;aries of the article will be di&s;po&s;ed to admit as of &s;till greater authority and re|&s;pectability, I mean from the proceedings and deci&s;ion of the French convention. It appears from Paris pa|pers which in April la&s;t were tran&s;lated and republi&s;h|ed in the <HI>Aurora,</HI> that in the &s;itting of the convention, Dec. 29, 1794, after the hou&s;e had pa&s;&s;ed to the or|der of the day, "Johannot read the following articles of the projected decree, which were as follow&mdash;(here follow five articles.)</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Art. VI.</HEAD>
<P>"The decree concerning the &s;eque&s;tration of the property of the &s;ubjects of the powers at war with the Republic is annulled. Such &s;ums as have been paid by French citizens into the trea&s;ury in con&s;equence of tho&s;e decrees, will be reimbur&s;ed." This article occa|&s;ioned &s;ome debate. Ga&s;ton was again&s;t it. Cambon ob&s;erved, that the law of &s;eque&s;tration was extorted from the convention by the faction of Fabre d'Eglan|tine and Danton, but ought you to return the property of the Spani&s;h to the de&s;pot of Madrid? Thiriot agreed with Cambon. Colombel de&s;ired the a&s;&s;embly to annul only the &s;eque&s;tration of the &s;ums due for commercial relations. Ramel &s;hewed that the law of &s;eque&s;tration had been urged by the foreigners them|&s;elves and &s;tockjobbers, <HI>that it had prepared the ruin of commerce, and broken off, again&s;t the right of nations, the obligations of merchants in different &s;tates;</HI> though the powers at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Republic &s;hould not repeal the &s;eque&s;trat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of French property, it is our duty to &s;et the example. The &s;ixth article was maintained as reported.</P>
<P>I have thought it not u&s;ele&s;s to give a brief &s;ketch of this very intere&s;ting proceeding in the French con|vention, becau&s;e it not only e&s;tabli&s;hes what I contend to be the law of nations, but expo&s;es the injury and inju&s;tice of departing from this part of it even in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t violent war. And it ought to be
<PB N="229" REF="029752_0234_0FE25574DCC664E0">
remarked to the honor of our country, that during the cour&s;e of our revolution, notwith&s;tanding the warm re&s;entments it called forth, we never attempted to an|nul the Briti&s;h debts, but finally agreed to the 4th ar|ticle of the treaty of peace, "That creditors on ei|ther &s;ide &s;hould meet with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lawful impediment to the recovery of all bona fide debts heretofo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> contracted." So al&s;o in the Am&s;terdam and Antw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> loans, we ex|pre&s;sly &s;tipulated, that they &s;hould not be impaired on the event of a future war between the two countries.</P>
<P>I think it will be evident from the authorities which I have adduced, that the &s;eque&s;tration and confi&s;cati|on of debts and public &s;tock, are not <HI>now</HI> the cu&s;tom|ary and admi&s;&s;ible weapons of war. The ancient max|ims on this head are ju&s;tly and generally exploded by civilized nations, and the intere&s;ts of commerce in this, as in many other in&s;tances, have happily &s;et bounds to the intemperance of Gothic rage. In &s;tipulating to a formal renunciation of this mode of warfare, we have done no more than what we were bound to do by the acknowledged dictates of good faith. We have renounced a weapon which our own &s;en&s;e of right and policy had before forbidden us to u&s;e. If howe|ver it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed that occa&s;ions may &s;ometimes ari&s;e in which it would be expedient for the purpo&s;e of more effectually wounding our enemies, to attack public or private contracts, then let me a&s;k, what diffi|culty has the treaty thrown in the way? The &s;ame fiercene&s;s of character which would lead us to violate the received maxims of war and national duty, would readily &s;et a&s;ide the moral obligation of this article. Its only effect ari&s;es from laying down in the rational &s;ea|&s;on of peace, the rule of conduct in war, and by &s;uper|adding an expre&s;s, to the implied, &s;anction of good faith.</P>
<P>But it is alleged that this article has no actual re|ciprocity, becau&s;e all the debts are due from us either as a nation or as individuals, and that our citizens
<PB N="230" REF="029752_0235_0FE2557E8BFDAFD8">
hold no Briti&s;h &s;tock, and have few or no demands upon their &s;ubjects. If, however, this &s;pecies of con|fi&s;cation be really repugnant to the pre&s;ent u&s;age of nations, and is unju&s;t and impolitic, the renunciation was equally fit and proper, whether it was mutual or not, and in proportion to the means we had of u&s;ing this mode of warfare, does the &s;acrifice redound to our credit and character. But the truth is, that the bene|ficial operation of this article is principally on our &s;ide. It is much more &s;atisfactory and nece&s;&s;ary to us, than it is to Great Britain, becau&s;e it tends directly to fo&s;|ter and &s;trengthen the credit of the United States, both public and private, a circum&s;tance of the utmo&s;t moment to our pro&s;perity as an infant nation.</P>
<P>It is by force of public credit, that our government has attained to its pre&s;ent &s;tability, and has &s;o many competent means of acting with efficacy whenever the public exigencies require it. Credit, as a good judge of our intere&s;t has ob&s;erved, is <HI>the invigorating princi|ple of this country.</HI> Any addition to it, however &s;ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l, will give much greater power of &s;elf-defence, than the little per&s;idious and exploded re&s;ource of confi&s;cating debts or violating the pledged negociability, and &s;a|credne&s;s of public &s;tock. Nor is private credit of much le&s;s utility in a country which has &s;o little capital, in proportion to the extent and variety of the demands for it. We have immen&s;e territories of wa&s;te land to clear and &s;ettle; and abundance of raw materials for nouri&s;hing the manufacturing and mechanic arts: but to an&s;wer the&s;e ends, requires an uncea&s;ing &s;upply of capital, or credit, which in mo&s;t ca&s;es is its eligible &s;ub|&s;titute. In &s;hort there are no people upon earth who have &s;o many inducements as the United States, to de|clare unequivocally to the world, that the claims of their creditors &s;hall always be deemed &s;acred in peace and in war.</P>
<P>After taking &s;uch a full view of the &s;ubject, we can|not withhold our a&s;toni&s;hment that Mr. Burr, and Mr. Tazewell, &s;hould each of them, in the &s;enate, by for|mal

propo&s;itions of amendment, &s;ingle out this article, among others, as a proper object of cen&s;ure and repeal.</P>
<P>There is one more objection to this article, which merits &s;ome attention for its &s;ingularity; and becau&s;e it places in a &s;trong light, the extreme jealou&s;y or pre|determination to condemn, with which every part of the treaty has been read. It is apprehended or rather pretended to be, that the king of Great Britain will engro&s;s all the &s;hares of our &s;everal American banks, and thereby obtain the entire controul of them and fill them with Briti&s;h directors. It is ju&s;t as rational to &s;up|po&s;e that he will buy up all our goods and chattels, and thereby put a total &s;top to agriculture and manufac|tures. If the king of Great Britain is di&s;po&s;ed to ex|pend his money for the di&s;turbance of our government, there are much more effective methods of doing it than by the indirect means of our banks. Such an apprehen|&s;ion is ridiculous in the extreme, and cannot &s;urely im|po&s;e on the mo&s;t credulous mind, e&s;pecially when it is known that the &s;everal bank charters expre&s;sly provide that <HI>all the directors &s;hall be American citizens,</HI> and that no &s;tockholder &s;hall be entitled to vote for a director unle&s;s he either <HI>attends in per&s;on or re&s;ides within the Untied States.</HI></P>
<P>We have now fini&s;hed an examination of the fir&s;t ten articles of the treaty, and which form the per|manent part; for the commercial articles which fol|low being of more difficult adju&s;tment, and their ef|fect not being &s;o ea&s;ily a&s;certained by theory as ex|perience, were wi&s;ely limited to a &s;hort period. It has often been a&s;ked, and with an air of con&s;cious triumph, what &s;ingle equivalent have we got for &s;o many and great conce&s;&s;ions on our part? Let us review for a moment the ground we have gone over, and &s;ee if an an&s;wer cannot be given which will &s;atisfy all the real friends to the intere&s;t of our country.</P>
<P>We have gained all the we&s;tern po&s;ts without blood&s;hed&mdash;we have obtained a promi&s;e of complete

indemnity for all unlawful &s;poliations on our trade, as &s;oon as an impartial tribunal &s;hall have a&s;certained the amount of our lo&s;&s;es&mdash;We have obtained a liberal and permanent commerce between our frontiers and the whole frontier of the Briti&s;h provinces in Ame|rica, and we have by the&s;e means removed the prin|cipal &s;ources of national complaint again&s;t Great-Britain, and &s;ecured to our country the continuance of the ble&s;&s;ings of peace. And what have we con|ceded on our part? We have promi&s;ed to pay &s;uch lo&s;&s;es only as Briti&s;h creditors have &s;uffered in their debts, by occa&s;ion of legal impediments in this coun|try, as &s;oon as an impartial tribunal &s;hall have a&s;cer|tained the amount of &s;uch lo&s;&s;es, and to pay for &s;uch Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els only as we have &s;uffered, without u&s;ing the means in our power to prevent it, to be captured within our territory, contrary to the law of nations. And we have al&s;o allowed a liberal and permanent commerce between Canada and our interior po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons. The&s;e are the material parts of the permanent treaty, and it appears that both nations have conceded, in tho&s;e in&s;tances, what in ju&s;tice and equity they ought to have done, and to have manife&s;ted a mutual di&s;po&s;ition to forget pa&s;t animo&s;ity, and to live upon friendly terms hereafter.</P>

<P>IN examining the commercial part of the treaty, we are not to enquire, as we have heretofore done, into matter of &s;trict right. Arrangements of com|merce mu&s;t depend upon the good will and plea&s;ure of the contracting parties. They are things of imper|fect obligation only, and cannot be peremptorily de|manded. Every nation will accommodate &s;o far, and &s;o far only, as &s;uits her intere&s;ts or policy, and it will always be a que&s;tion to be determined in &s;ound di&s;cretion by other powers, how far <HI>their</HI> intere&s;t or policy will admit of a connexion, on &s;uch terms as can
<PB N="233" REF="029752_0238_0FE25583731652C8">
be obtained. Commercial propo&s;itions may be grant|ed, acceded to, or rejected by either party, without affording to the other any ju&s;t cau&s;e of war. It is therefore a matter for con&s;ideration, how far the re|maining articles of the treaty are admi&s;&s;ible or not, upon the principles of public expediency.</P>
<P>Although the 12th article may now very properly be left out of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, yet &s;ince it is the fa&s;hion to reprobate it in the mo&s;t unqualified terms, and to u&s;e it as an in&s;trument for inflaming the public pa&s;&s;ions, as well as to carry di&s;grace to the other parts of the work, it may not be ami&s;s to give it &s;ome examina|tion.</P>
<P>It is well known that every European nation has endeavoured, more or le&s;s, to monopolize to it&s;elf, the commerce of its colonies, and upon that account pro|hibited the &s;hips of foreign nations from trading to them, and has prohibited them from importing Euro|pean goods from any foreign nation.&mdash;This has been the ca&s;e with Denmark, Holland, France, Spain, Portugal, and Great Britain, although the manner in which this monopoly has been exerci&s;ed in tho&s;e dif|ferent nations, has been very different. Great Bri|tain has been as much di&s;tingui&s;hed as any of her neighbours, during a century pa&s;t, for a pertinacious adherence to the monopoly &s;y&s;tem, and it has become one of the rivetted maxims of her policy, to regard the exclu&s;ive enjoyment of her colony trade, as an e&s;|&s;ential nur&s;ery of &s;eamen, and a con&s;tant &s;upport of her naval power. So late as the year 1783, Lord Sheffield gave his &s;anction to this ancient doctrine, and &s;aid, that it would be impolitic in Great Britain to admit American ve&s;&s;els into the Briti&s;h We&s;t India i&s;lands, and we &s;ee with what great allowance we ought to compare the privileges conceded in this ar|ticle, with the theory of an unlimited commerce.</P>
<P>The French convention, during their pre&s;ent revo|lution, have recognized and adopted the Engli&s;h po|licy
<PB N="234" REF="029752_0239_0FE2558B574D2238">
This appears from the eloquent report of Bar|rere, upon their navigation act, which is intended for perpetuity, and is declared to be the ba&s;is of their po|licy and commerce. The act ordains, that no com|modities &s;hall be imported into France, but in French ve&s;&s;els, or in tho&s;e of the country which produced the commodity; and that foreign ve&s;&s;els &s;hall not tran&s;port from one French port to another, any com|modities of the growth or manufactures of France or her colonies.&mdash;And, notwith&s;tanding the nece&s;&s;ities of the war may have induced the French to a tempo|rary departure from this act, we may be a&s;&s;ured, the principles advanced in the report, are too generally and powerfully felt, not to induce them to adhere to it on the return of peace, as the &s;ure ba&s;is of their maritime &s;trength. "The prohibitions of a naviga|tion act," &s;ays Barrere, "&s;hould be as exten&s;ive as they could be made, for without them it would be a mere illu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ory mea&s;ure. The Engli&s;h," continues he, "from whom we borrow this &s;y&s;tem, have given it that exten&s;ion, and, indeed, they are to be applauded for it."</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the value that is attached to the carrying trade, in the opinion of the European nations, we have no rea&s;on to be di&s;appointed that Mr. Jay could not get acce&s;s to the Briti&s;h I&s;lands on better terms. It was to have been wi&s;hed that he could have got the admi&s;&s;ion of ve&s;&s;els of any burden into this trade, but this was undoubtedly beyond his pow|er. While Great Britain con&s;ented to admit us to trade to her i&s;lands in our own bottoms, we may be a&s;&s;ured &s;he was determined to do it in &s;uch a manner as not materially to affect her carrying trade, the &s;ource of her &s;ecurity and greatne&s;s. This mu&s;t have been the rea&s;on with her for re&s;tricting our ve&s;&s;els to 70 tons and under (and indeed it is under&s;tood that the treaty was kept open for &s;ome time on the part of Mr. Jay, while he was endeavouring to extend this clau&s;e) and from carrying any mola&s;&s;es, &s;ugar, coffee,
<PB N="235" REF="029752_0240_0FE2558E04C90578">
cocoa or cotton, either from her i&s;lands in ve&s;&s;els of the United States, to any where but this country. It will be a&s;ked why Great Britain &s;honld wi&s;h to re|&s;train us from carrying any of the&s;e articles to Europe, provided they are not the growth of her i&s;lands? the an&s;wer is, that nothing &s;hort of a total prohibition, would in her opinion, effectually &s;ecure her carrying trade, &s;ince her own and foreign &s;ugar or coffee would not ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed, and any modification would have opened a wide door to elude the whole intent of the re&s;traint, would have rendered the whole prohi|bition, to u&s;e the words of Barrere, <HI>a mere illu&s;ory mea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>It is not my intention to vindicate either the ju&s;t|ne&s;s or liberality of this policy on the part of Great Britain. It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay that it appears to have been her inflexible policy, and to which &s;he thought her&s;elf bound in duty to adhere. The only que&s;tion is, whether there was any rea&s;onable pro&s;pect at pre|&s;ent of our obtaining better terms; and if not, whe|ther it was not upon the whole for our intere&s;t to ac|cept of the trade upon tho&s;e terms? This may yet be a doubtful point, though I acknowledge a con&s;i|derable objection to the 12th article as it now &s;tands, that is, the prohibition to carry mela&s;&s;es, &s;ugar, cot|ton, &amp;c. to Europe, is &s;o general as to include tho&s;e articles even of our own production. This prohibiti|on, with re&s;pect to coffee and &s;ugar in particular, it is &s;aid, would be very inconvenient to us during the pre&s;ent war, though in time of peace it would be of no con&s;equence.&mdash;The 12th article does not prohibit us from exporting any of tho&s;e articles from the other We&s;t India i&s;lands to any part of the world. We are only re&s;tricted from exporting them from the Briti&s;h We&s;t India i&s;lands (except to the United States) in order to pre&s;erve to the Engli&s;h their carrying trade, and from the United States in order to pre&s;erve the other re&s;traint from eva&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="029752_0241_0FE2558F937425F8">It ought not to be forgotten that this article was limited to two years from the conclu&s;ion of the pre|&s;ent war, and then the contracting parties were to endeavour to regulate this trade, with a view to their mutual advantage, and <HI>the exten&s;ion of commerce;</HI> and if they &s;hould not agree on new arrangements, all the articles of the treaty, except the fir&s;t ten, were to fall to the ground. At the end of the two years we &s;hould mo&s;t probably have entered on the nego|ciation with much le&s;s difficulty than at pre&s;ent.&mdash;The Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies would have been for &s;ome time accu&s;tomed to the benefits of our trade, and have got into the habit of placing their dependence as well as their affections upon it; while the mother country would have been a little familiarized to our trade with her colonies, and her jealou&s;ies and pre|judices would probably have greatly dimini&s;hed with regard to it. We &s;hould have renewed the di&s;cu&s;&s;i|on with all tho&s;e advantages which we now want, and the chance is, that the intercour&s;e would not only have been continued but been attended with a favorable enlargement. And if eventually the ne|gociation &s;hould have failed and left only the ten fir&s;t articles of the treaty remaining, yet tho&s;e arti|cles, as we noticed in the la&s;t number, are well wor|thy of the mi&s;&s;ion, &s;ince they re&s;tore tranquillity and ju&s;tice to our country.</P>
<P>The 13th article of the treaty relates to our commerce with the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t-Indies, and all the advantages which art conceded to us by this article, are without the &s;malle&s;t pretended equivalent on our part. The privileges of this article are not denied by tho&s;e who have been mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for their in|di&s;criminate condemnation of the whole treaty. <HI>De|cius</HI> complains, however, that our commerce was on a better footing before, by the mere permi&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h government. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve in an&s;wer to this, that the &s;ame permi&s;&s;ion can &s;till be continued: there is nothing in this article which pro|hibits
<PB N="237" REF="029752_0242_0FE255912668EA90">
the India coa&s;ting trade. It would have been unnece&s;&s;ary, for &s;uch prohibition exi&s;ted before. The article barely declares, that none of its privileges &s;hall be con&s;trued to extend to the coa&s;ting trade. In other re&s;pects it leaves that trade ju&s;t as it found it, under the precarious plea&s;ure of the Briti&s;h govern|ment. But prior to this article, our whole inter|cour&s;e with Briti&s;h Ea&s;t-India was a matter of favor, and &s;urely it is a very important con&s;ideration that we can now claim it as a matter of right. Mr. Jef|fer&s;on, in his report on the privileges and re&s;trictions of our commerce in foreign countries, &s;eems to have thought very differently from <HI>Decius</HI> on the &s;ubject of a precarious trade. He con&s;idered a commerce depending on the &s;ole di&s;cretion of a foreign power, as a real inconvenience. "The di&s;advantage (he ob|&s;erves) of a tenure which may be &s;uddenly di&s;conti|nued, was experienced by our merchants on a late occa&s;ion. The embarra&s;&s;ments of the moment were great, and the po&s;&s;ibility of their renewal lays our commerce to England under a &s;pecies of di&s;courage|ment. The di&s;tinction is too remarkable not to be noticed, that our navigation is excluded from the &s;e|curity of fixed laws, while that &s;ecurity is given to the navigation of others."</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks of Mr. Jeffer&s;on are &s;olid; and they out-weigh a thou&s;and town-meeting re&s;olves. <HI>Without this treaty our trade to every British port can be interdicted by a nod of the Briti&s;h executive.</HI> But by this treaty, our commerce to England and the Ea&s;t-Indies, which now re&s;ts on the will of the mini|&s;try or the colonial government, is placed on the footing of permanent right. In this re&s;pect we gain an immen&s;e advantage&mdash;an advantage that we do not enjoy to the &s;ame extent, with any other na|tion upon earth.</P>
<P>The commercial conce&s;&s;ions on the part of Great-Britain, which we have been ju&s;t reviewing, are not only equal, but &s;uperior to tho&s;e which are to be met
<PB N="238" REF="029752_0243_0FE2559B639158C0">
with in the commercial treaties between her and othe powers, for more than a century pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The treaty between Great-Britain and Spain, in 1667, and which for its advantages in matters of trade, was confirmed in 1713, takes &s;pecial care to limit the commerce of the two nations to the terri|tories, provinces and i&s;lands, <HI>to which trade and com|merce had before been accu&s;tomed.</HI> And yet two years afterwards his Catholic maje&s;ty, as an evidence of his inclination to cultivate friend&s;hip, does indeed allow the Engli&s;h to gather &s;alt in the i&s;le of Tortu|gas, <HI>becau&s;e they had enjoyed that liberty in the reign of Charles II.</HI></P>
<P>In the treaty of commerce and navigation between Great-Britain and Ru&s;&s;ia, which was made in the year 1766, the friendly privileges of trade between the two powers, were confined to &s;uch places <HI>where leave in granted to the &s;ubjects of other nations.</HI> In the &s;ame &s;pirit of jealou&s;y and colony monopoly, which appears but too prevalent throughout Europe, Ru&s;&s;ia takes care in her treaty of amity and commerce with Denmark, in the year 1782, to except from the com|mercial grant, her ports of the Black and Ca&s;pain &s;eas, and all her other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in A&s;ia&mdash;and the king of Denmark, on his part, excepts al&s;o his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions in America, and el&s;ewhere out of Europe. Nay, in the more recent treaty between France and England in 1786, and which was made with the ex|pre&s;s view of promoting a more liberal intercour&s;e, the trade is limited to each other's territories <HI>&s;ituated in Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Nor have our own treaties of commerce with the powers of Europe been more favored in this re&s;pect. In the treaty with France, on which &s;o much unqua|lified applau&s;e has been be&s;towed by the enemies of the in&s;trument under con&s;ideration, there is no very exten&s;ive admi&s;&s;ion to her colonial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. France indeed grants us as a matter of favor, one or more free ports in Europe, and <HI>the free ports which have
<PB N="239" REF="029752_0244_0FE2559D2B8213A8">
been end are open in the French i&s;lands in America.</HI> And in our treaty of commerce with Holland, we expre&s;sly &s;tipulate to leave to the Dutch the <HI>peaceable enjoyment of their rights in the countries, i&s;lands, and &s;eas, in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, without any hindrance or mole&s;tation.</HI> This is, indeed, &s;tipulating for the per petuity of their monopoly. On the other hand, Great Britain, by the 13th article of the pre&s;ent treaty, gives us a free and liberal admi&s;&s;ion into all her terri|tories in the Ea&s;t Indies; on immen&s;e country, which contains more than twenty millions of inhabitants, is guarded by an army of above 70,000 men&mdash;and yields an annual revenue of more than eight millions &s;terling. And the only re&s;triction to which we bind our&s;elves, in return, is not to carry <HI>her</HI> Ea&s;t India commodities to any country but America, where they &s;hall he unladen&mdash;a re&s;triction which Britain could very rea&s;onably a&s;k as a &s;ecurity to her carrying trade.</P>
<P>I cannot but conclude, that every rea&s;onable man will &s;ee in this article, &s;ome evidence of a &s;pirit of ac|commodation on the part of Great Britain, and much proof of influence and ability in our negociator.</P>

<P>THIS article admits Americans to a free trade to the Briti&s;h dominions in Europe, and Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to the &s;ame free trade in the United States.</P>
<P>One would think that this article was &s;o recipro|cal as to admit of no ground of cen&s;ure. But even this article has not given us an equivalent in the opini|on of &s;ome men, who contend, that as Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els are excluded from <HI>no port</HI> in the United States, &s;o American ve&s;&s;els ought to be excluded from no port in the <HI>Briti&s;h territories.</HI></P>

he &s;hould have added, we are admitted there only by proclamation from year to year.</P>
<P>But does <HI>Decius</HI> value a commercial country by its geographical dimen&s;ions? Do the&s;e con&s;titute the greatne&s;s or &s;mallne&s;s of commercial privileges? This certainly is a new doctrine; and the chicanery of &s;uch in&s;inuations de&s;erves reprobation by every hone&s;t man.</P>
<P>No matter what is the &s;ize of Great Britain&mdash;ad|mit that it does not comprehend more land than the &s;tate of New York has, in a <HI>republican humor,</HI> &s;old to an individual; this is nothing to the point. The trade of that &s;pot of earth, is at lea&s;t double, not to &s;ay treble, the trade of the United States,&mdash;By ad|mitting American citizens to a free participation of this commerce, we have more than an equivalent for a free admi&s;&s;ion of Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els into all the ports of the United States.</P>
<P>The reflection of <HI>Decius,</HI> that our "envoy has, in this place, brought the principles of inequality into con&s;picuous action, as if anxious to circum&s;cribe our commerce, and that he lo&s;es no opportunity of impo&s;|ing re&s;trictions on it," has not a &s;hadow of foundati|on&mdash;it is the fabrication of a mo&s;t malignant mind. The whole article is founded on mo&s;t equal and reci|procal principles, &s;o far as regards Great Britain, in|dependent of her colonies: but in proportion to the extent of the manufactures and export of that coun|try, it is mo&s;t advantageous to America.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid we are not admitted into all the Briti&s;h colonies. True; but &s;uch admi&s;&s;ion would be a con|ce&s;&s;ion to us without an equivalent, for we have no colonies to exchange the benefit.</P>
<P>Let us contra&s;t this article with the privileges ob|tained by the treaty with France, negociated by the "Venerable Franklin." By the 30th article of that treaty, "The mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty will grant the &s;ubjects of the United States <HI>one or more free ports in Europe,</HI> and the free ports which have been and are
<PB N="241" REF="029752_0246_0FE255A0504A5D48">
open in the French i&s;lands." Since the revolution, nece&s;&s;ity has compelled the convention to open all the ports in France: but which nation was mo&s;t liberal in times of peace, or mo&s;t jealous of its trade?</P>
<P>Great Britain opens <HI>all</HI> her ports in Europe&mdash;all her ports in the Ea&s;t Indies&mdash;and all her ports in the We&s;t Indies, to ve&s;&s;els of &s;mall burden, re&s;tricting on|ly the direct carrying trade <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her colonies to Eu|rope. France opened one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> ports in Europe, &s;ome of her ports in the We&s;t Indies, and not one in the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>This is a fair &s;tatement of the advantages of trade with the two countries, as we enjoyed them with France before the revolution, and as we &s;hould enjoy them by the pre&s;ent treaty with Great Britain; and let any man decide, which treaty is the mo&s;t liberal, in re&s;pect to opening the ports of the two countries and their colonies. The advantage is infinitely on the &s;ide of the pre&s;ent treaty with Great Britain.</P>

The &s;econd clau&s;e of the article, re&s;erving to Great Britain the right of impo&s;|ing duties on our tonnage, equal to what we impo&s;e on Briti&s;h tonnage in our ports, concedes nothing but what Great Britain now enjoys; that is, the right of treating our trade as we treat hers.

I am per&s;uaded it is not only mo&s;t honorable, but mo&s;t expedient; and that ju&s;tice and a &s;pirit of accommodation will procure more advantages than a revengeful, retaliating, ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The 16th, re&s;pecting con&s;uls, is probably not ob|jectionable.</P>

<HEAD>Article 17.</HEAD>
<P>This is one of the articles which has excited the mo&s;t violent clamors. Indeed we cannot but ob&s;erve, that &s;uch articles as may affect the French, are repro|bated with more warmth than tho&s;e which affect &s;ole|ly the intere&s;ts of the United States. It would &s;eem by the zeal di&s;covered on this occa&s;ion, that this treaty ought fir&s;t to have con&s;ulted the wants and wi&s;hes of France; and the intere&s;ts of the United States ought to have been only a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> con&s;idera|tion. There is certainly a precept of high authority, "that we &s;hould love our neighbour as our&s;elves;" but I know of no rule that requires one nation to love another <HI>better</HI> than it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am di&s;po&s;ed to treat the French nation with the utmo&s;t impartiality, ju&s;tice and friend&s;hip; and in our compacts with their enemies, we ought to make no &s;acrifices of their intere&s;t, and yield no points to their enemies, which the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e and the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of our own country do not require.</P>
<P>By this maxim let the articles which may affect France be fairly examined.</P>
<P>The great objection to the 17th article is, that it "has &s;olemnly relinqui&s;hed a point, which to us was of more value than the amount of all the depredations on our trade, the &s;ums due to us for negroes, and lo&s;&s;es by detention of our po&s;ts." Now, what is the point relinqui&s;hed? The an&s;wer is, nothing which was our own; nothing which we could command: nothing which the Briti&s;h nation did not enjoy before.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="029752_0248_0FE255AC2D294F50">
The article &s;tipulates, that ve&s;&s;els captured on &s;u&s;|picion of having enemies' property on board, or of carrying contraband articles to an enemy, &s;hall be brought into the neare&s;t or mo&s;t convenient port, and if any property of an enemy is found on board, that part only which belongs to the enemy &s;hall be made prize. This is &s;aid to be a relinqui&s;hment of an im|portant point on our part. This is a gro&s;s mi&s;repre|&s;entation.</P>
<P>Relinqui&s;hment implies an abandonment of &s;ome|thing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. If we never had a right to prevent the capture of our ve&s;&s;els, on &s;u&s;picion of having ene|mies property on board, and to prevent the &s;eizure of that property, then we have not relinqui&s;hed it. But that right, with re&s;pect to nations not in treaty with us, we never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; we, therefore, have yielded nothing that we before enjoyed.</P>
<P>By the law of nations, any neutral ve&s;&s;el may be &s;topped and &s;earched, and any property of an ene|my found on board, may be &s;eized. This law can|not be altered but by con&s;ent of the contracting par|ties. Great Britain has that right confe&s;&s;edly, and &s;he will not at pre&s;ent con&s;ent to relinqui&s;h it. She <HI>will</HI> exerci&s;e that right&mdash;&s;he <HI>does</HI> exerci&s;e it&mdash;and where is the power to compel her to abandon it?&mdash;<HI>We</HI> have no &s;uch power, nor is there a power on earth that has a right to demand it, or authority to enforce &s;uch a demand. If that is ever &s;urrendered, it mu&s;t be by voluntary con&s;ent.</P>
<P>This being the true &s;tate of things, what has the article of the treaty &s;tipulated? Ob&s;erve the trade. It is not &s;aid the property of an enemy <HI>may</HI> be taken&mdash;but, taking the right for granted, it &s;ays, the <HI>ene|my's property, only, &s;hall</HI> be made prize.</P>
<P>The article further &s;tipulates, and this was obvi|ou&s;ly the main purpo&s;e of in&s;erting it in the treaty, that the ve&s;&s;el &s;hall be &s;uffered to proceed with the re&s;t of her cargo, without impediment&mdash;that there
<PB N="244" REF="029752_0249_0FE255ADC18DF6E8">
&s;hall be no delay in deciding on &s;uch ca&s;es and in the payment or recovery of indemnification by the owners or by the ma&s;ters of the ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the whole amount of the article is, that the practice of &s;topping and examining &s;hip for ene|my's property&mdash;a practice authorized by the law of nations&mdash;a practice which Great Britain will not re&s;ign, and which we cannot per&s;uade or compel her to re&s;ign&mdash;that this practice &s;hall be rendered as little in|convenient to our trade as po&s;&s;ible. The article was intended to re&s;train, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the abu&s;es of this practice by licentious privateers.</P>
<P>There are many men, who, without any rule of con|duct pre&s;cribed to them, would behave with unbound|ed licentiou&s;ne&s;s; but if a national compact is before their eyes, they will re&s;pect the rules pre&s;cribed. So far, therefore, as the article goes, it can do no harm; but it may and often will do good.</P>
<P>But to exhibit this thing in &s;till &s;tronger light, I will give the whole of Mr. Jeffer&s;on's letter on the &s;ubject. It is an an&s;wer to a remon&s;trance from Mr. Genet to the pre&s;ident, re&s;pecting the &s;eizure of French property on board of American ve&s;&s;els, dated July 9, 1793. It is the very point in que&s;tion, and as the rea&s;oning of Mr. Jeffer&s;on is, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e unan&s;werable, it is proper the public &s;hould have the letter entire.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favor of the 9th in&s;t. covered the infor|mation of Silvat Ducamp, Pierre Nouvel, Chouquet de Savarence, Ga&s;ton de Nogere, and G. Beu&s;tier,
<PB N="245" REF="029752_0250_0FE255AF4FC94E38">
that being on their pa&s;&s;age from the French We&s;t-Indies to the United States, with &s;laves and merchan|di&s;e of their property, the&s;e ve&s;&s;els were &s;topped by Briti&s;h armed ve&s;&s;els, and their property taken out as lawful prize.</P>
<P>I believe it cannot be doubted, but that by the ge|neral law of nations, the goods of a friend found in the ve&s;&s;els of an enemy, are free, and the goods of an enemy, found in the ve&s;&s;el of a friend, are lawful prize. Upon this principle, I pre&s;ume, the Briti&s;h armed ve&s;&s;els have taken the property of French ci|tizens found in our ve&s;&s;els, in the ca&s;es above-men|tioned, and I confe&s;s I &s;hould be at a lo&s;s on what principle to reclaim it. It is true, that &s;undry na|tions, de&s;irous of avoiding the inconvenience of hav|ing their ve&s;&s;els &s;topped at &s;ea, ran&s;acked, carried into port, detained, under pretence of having ene|my's goods on board, have, in many in&s;tances, in|troduced by their &s;pecial treaties, another principle between them, that enemy bottoms &s;hall make ene|my goods, and friendly bottoms friendly goods; a principle much le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ing to commerce, and equal to all parties in point of gain and lo&s;s; but this is altogether the effect of particular treaty, con|trouling, in &s;pecial ca&s;es, the general principle of the law of nations, and therefore taking effect between &s;uch nations only as have &s;o agreed to cantroul it. England has generally determined to adhere to the rigorous principle, having, in no in&s;tance, as far as I recollect, agreed to the modification of letting the property of the goods follow that of the ve&s;&s;el, except in the &s;ingle one of her treaty with France. We have adopted this modification in our treaties with France, the United Netherlands, and Pru&s;&s;ia; and therefore, as to them, our ve&s;&s;els cover the goods of their enemies, and we lo&s;e our goods when in the ve&s;|&s;els of their enemies. Accordingly, you will be plea&s;|ed to recollect, that in the late ca&s;e of Holland and
<PB N="246" REF="029752_0251_0FE255B98D4EB148">
Mackie, citizens of the United States, who had laden a cargo of flour on board a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el, which was taken by the French frigate Ambu&s;cade, and brought into this port; when I reclaimed the cargo, it was only on the ground that they were ignorant of the de|claration of war when it was &s;hipped.</P>
<P>You ob&s;erved, however, that the 14th article of our treaty had provided that ignorance &s;hould not he pleaded beyond two months after the declaration of war, which term had elap&s;ed, in this ca&s;e, by &s;ome few days; and finding that to be the truth, though their real ignorance was equally true, I declined the reclamation, as it never was in my view to reclaim the cargo, nor in yours to offer to re&s;tore it, by que&s;|tioning the rule e&s;tabli&s;hed in our treaty, that enemy bottoms make enemy goods. With England, Spain, Portugal and Au&s;tria, we have no treaties; therefore we have nothing to oppo&s;e to their acting according to the general law of nations, that enemy goods are lawful prize, though found in the bottoms of a friend. Nor do I &s;ee that France can &s;uffer, on the whole, for though &s;he lo&s;es her goods in our ve&s;&s;els, when found therein by England, Spain, Portugal or Au&s;tria, yet &s;he gains our goods when found in the ve&s;&s;els of England, Spain, Portugal, Au&s;tria, the United Netherlands or Pru&s;&s;ia; and I believe I may &s;afely affirm, that we have more goods afloat in the ve&s;&s;els of the&s;e &s;ix nations, than France has afloat in our ve&s;&s;els, and con&s;equently, that France is the gainer, and we the lo&s;er, by the prin|ciple of our treaty; indeed we are lo&s;ers in every direc|tion of that principle; for when it works in our favor, it is to &s;ave the goods of our friends; when it works again&s;t us, it is to lo&s;e our own; and we &s;hall continue to lo&s;e while the rule is only partially e&s;tabli&s;hed. When we &s;hall have e&s;tabli&s;hed it with all nations, we &s;hall be in a condition neither to gain nor lo&s;e, but &s;hall be le&s;s expo&s;ed to vexatious &s;earches at &s;ea. To this condition we are endeavouring to advance; but as it depends on the will of other nations, as well as our
<PB N="247" REF="029752_0252_0FE255BB4E1AC760">
own, we can only obtain it when they &s;hall be ready to concur.</P>
<P>I cannot, therefore, but flatter my&s;elf, that on re|vi&s;ing the ca&s;es of Ducamp and others, you will per|ceive, that their lo&s;&s;es re&s;ult from the &s;tate of war, which has permitted their enemies to take their goods, though found in our ve&s;&s;els, and con&s;equently, from circum&s;tances over which we have no controul.</P>
<P>The rudene&s;s to their per&s;ons practi&s;ed by their enemies, is certainly not favorable to the character of the latter. We feel for it as much as for the exten|&s;ion of it to our own citizens, their companions, and find in it a motive for requiring mea&s;ures to be taken, which may prevent repetitions of it.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I beg the reader to note the following clau&s;e of the foregoing letter: "To this condition, we are endea|vouring to advance; but as it depends on the <HI>will of other nations</HI> as well as our own, we can only obtain it, when THEY &s;hall be ready to concur."</P>
<P>I will clo&s;e with remarking, that by our treaty with France, it is expre&s;sly &s;tipulated, that <HI>free</HI> &s;hips &s;hould make <HI>free</HI> goods. The convention, however in 1793, ordered ve&s;&s;els, laden with provi&s;ions, to be carried into their ports, in violation of that treaty. They afterwards revoked the decree with re&s;pect to American ve&s;&s;els. They afterwards extended the de|cree to American ve&s;&s;els, in defiance of the treaty. A few months ago, they relented, confe&s;&s;ed they had ill-treated their allies, and annulled the decree a &s;econd time. A &s;tatement of the&s;e facts was made by the pre&s;ident to congre&s;s, Dec. 5, 1793. See his addre&s;s

of that date, prefixed to the corre&s;pondence between Mr. Jeffer&s;on and Mr. Hammond.</P>
<P>Such un&s;teadine&s;s in public mea&s;ures operates pecu|liarly to the prejudice of trade. The merchant, if he knows enemy's property is liable to &s;eizure, may avoid ri&s;k by declining to take it on board. But when a nation is changing its regulations on this head, the merchant is expo&s;ed to vexations, without the power of avoiding the evil.</P>

<HEAD>Article 18.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is one of the articles in the treaty which gives great offence. The objections to it are&mdash;"That it enumerates among contraband goods, timber for &s;hip building, tar and rozin, copper in &s;heets, &s;ails, hemp and cordage, and generally whatever may &s;erve directly to the equipment of ve&s;&s;els, unwrought iron and fir planks only excepted; and that it admits pro|vi&s;ions in certain ca&s;es to be contraband," contrary to all our other treaties, and even contrary to the treaty of 1786, between Great Britain and France.</P>
<P>I frankly acknowledge that no part of the treaty is more vulnerable than this:&mdash;no part can furni&s;h more &s;ub&s;tantial grounds of complaint.</P>
<P>This article proceeds from a &s;trict adherence on the part of Great Britain, to every part of the law of nations, which favors her &s;uperiority as a great mari|time power; and its defence re&s;ts on the inability of our envoy to procure a relaxation of tho&s;e laws.</P>
<P>The time for negociating this article was unfavora|ble, as in mo&s;t other re&s;pects it was favorable. Great Britain, always anxious to pre&s;erve her naval &s;trength, the great and only bulwark of the nation, is now en|gaged in a mo&s;t inveterate war with France, a war on which her very exi&s;tence depends, and at this time, will not yield one clau&s;e of the law of nations, to
<PB N="249" REF="029752_0254_0FE255BE6A1208E8">
abridge her own power of crippling the naval force of her enemy. This is a &s;ixed point; and our envoy could only admit the article in that form.</P>
<P>There were but two alterations; both of which would re&s;ult in the <HI>&s;ame con&s;equences to our trade.</HI>&mdash;This idea is an important one. If the article had been rejected by our mini&s;ter, Great Britain <HI>has,</HI> and actually <HI>exerci&s;es,</HI> the right by the general laws of na|tions, to con&s;ider all tho&s;e articles contraband, and to declare them &s;uch, when &s;he judges that by the&s;e means &s;he can reduce her enemy. If the article was received, it could give no greater latitude to Great Britain than &s;he enjoyed before. Whichever alterna|tive our envoy might choo&s;e, our trade mu&s;t be &s;ub|ject to the exerci&s;e of the &s;ame right and to the &s;ame embarra&s;&s;ments.</P>
<P>If the right of treating all the articles mentioned as contraband, re&s;ults from the law of nations, and if Great Britain will not abandon that right, is it not better, in a treaty of a temporary nature, to accede to the right, and enumerate the articles which are liable to &s;eizure and confi&s;cation, that our merchants may know the law, and avoid lo&s;&s;es, than to &s;uffer that right to &s;tand on the law of nations, which is le&s;s known and which might expo&s;e our citizens to heavy lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Every liberal man mu&s;t wi&s;h to &s;ee the field of con|fi&s;cations in war narrowed as much as po&s;&s;ible: but if we cannot circum&s;cribe that field, is it not of great importance to our citizens, to mark out the ground with di&s;tinct lines, that every man may di&s;tingui&s;h it and &s;hun the danger?</P>
<P>Every rational per&s;on will &s;ay, <HI>it is;</HI> and this is the effect of this article of the treaty.</P>
<P>I know it has been contended that timber and provi&s;ions are not, by the law of nations, contraband. But Vattel, a modern French writer, of the highe&s;t authority, includes them among contraband goods.
<PB N="250" REF="029752_0255_0FE255C776798A98">
His words are, "Commodities particularly u&s;ed in war, and the importation of which to an enemy is prohibited, are called contraband goods. Such are arms, military and naval &s;tores, timber, hor&s;es, and even provi&s;ions, in certain junctures, when there are hopes of reducing the enemy by famine." Book 3. ch. 7. Sect. 112.</P>
<P>The words, naval &s;tores, includes cordage, hemp, tar, rozin, and every thing that &s;erves for the equip|ment of &s;hips of war. In the treaty of 1786, Great-Britain and France had excepted naval &s;tores and pro|vi&s;ions from the li&s;t of contraband articles. That treaty is annulled by the pre&s;ent war; and in a nu|merous collection of treaties now before me, I find no in&s;tance of an enumeration of naval &s;tores, as ex|cepted from contraband, by Great-Britain. But naval &s;tores are generally left by that nation, as con|traband by the general law of nations. The right to con&s;ider them &s;o, can be abridged only by treaty; and Great-Britain, at this moment, will con&s;ent to no &s;uch abridgment.</P>
<P>Some people &s;ay, it is better to let this point re&s;t on the law of nations, than to admit it in a treaty. This is merely a matter of expedience; but if the &s;afety of the merchants' property is con&s;ulted, it is unque&s;tionably better to have the contraband articles enumerated.</P>
<P>The &s;tipulations in the 2d and 3d clau&s;e, of the 18th article, are in favor of neutral ve&s;&s;els. The agreement, that when provi&s;ions are regarded as con|traband, they &s;hall be paid for to their full value, with a mercantile profit, freight and demurrage, is a rule of direction to the captors, that may prove favorable to a neutral trade, &s;ubject to be embarra&s;&s;ed by powers at war. And the provi&s;ion of the la&s;t clau&s;e, that neutral ve&s;&s;els entering a blockaded port, not knowing it to be blockaded, &s;hall not be &s;eized and
<PB N="251" REF="029752_0256_0FE255C92A16E318">
confi&s;cated for the fir&s;t attempt, is equally &s;alutary and favorable.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Article 19.</HEAD>
<P>This article provides again&s;t the ill u&s;age which the &s;ubjects of neutral powers are liable to receive from the commanders of &s;hips of war and privateers. This article is common in treaties&mdash;it is in nearly the &s;ame words, as in all our other treaties with foreign nations.</P>
<P>But it will be of much more u&s;e between Great Britain and America, as It will operate as a prohibi|tion again&s;t impre&s;&s;ing American &s;eamen on board of Engli&s;h &s;hips. It has been objected to the treaty, that no provi&s;ion of this kind is included in it. But the 19th article is a direct prohibition of this practice.</P>
<P>On account of a &s;amene&s;s of language, it is de&s;i|rable that &s;ome effectual mode might be devi&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h American from Briti&s;h &s;eamen. It might be of importance that American &s;eamen &s;hould be provided with certificates of their citizen&s;hip, under the &s;eal of &s;ome public officer. This doubtle&s;s de|&s;erves the attention of our executive, perhaps of con|gre&s;s, as not only Briti&s;h commanders, but French al&s;o, have mi&s;taken American &s;eamen for Briti&s;h, and our citizens are thus expo&s;ed to inju&s;tice from both parties.</P>
<P>It has been objected that the bonds required of the commanders of privateers to indemnify per&s;ons in|jured, are not large enough&mdash;the &s;ums being limited to 1500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling for &s;mall privateers, and 3000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling, in ca&s;e the privateer carries more than one hun|dred and fifty men. It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, in an&s;wer to this, that few ca&s;es can occur, where damages to a greater amount will be incurred: and where the bonds do not &s;ecure the damages, a complaint to government will in&s;ure any further claims founded in ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved, that this clau&s;e of the article is copied nearly from a &s;imilar one in the treaty of 1786, between Great Britain and France. The &s;ums
<PB N="252" REF="029752_0257_0FE255CABA055908">
limited by that treaty are the &s;ame; and will probably be found equal to all nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The la&s;t clau&s;e obliges judges of admiralty, in ca&s;e any &s;entence of condemnation has been pronounced again&s;t ve&s;&s;els or goods, to deliver on demand authen|tic copies of the proceedings to the ma&s;ter, he pay|ing the legal fees. A &s;tipulation of this kind was nece&s;&s;ary; as in&s;tances of delay and refu&s;al of &s;uch cop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es have been experienced by our citizens during the pre&s;ent war.</P>
<P>The 20th article is u&s;ual in all treaties. It makes provi&s;ion for guarding property from pirates, or re&s;tor|ing it to its proper owners&mdash;a provi&s;ion of mutual be|nefit, to the contracting parties, and liable to no ob|jection.</P>

<P>THIS article prohibits the &s;ubjects of the contract|ing parties, to commit acts of ho&s;tility again&s;t each other&mdash;to accept commi&s;&s;ions from a foreign prince or &s;tate, enemies to the other party&mdash;to enli&s;t them into military &s;ervice, &amp;c. and declares that the laws again&s;t &s;uch offences &s;hall be punctually executed.

<P>The &s;ame article of the treaty makes it piracy to accept a foreign commi&s;&s;ion or letter of marque, for arming any privateer to act against the other party.

When the treaty fir&s;t appeared, this article ex|cited much acrimony. It was con&s;idered as pointed at the military manoeuvres of a late French mi|ni&s;ter, who had attempted to excite Americans to war again&s;t the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements, and to priva|teering again&s;t Great Britain. It was &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;train the right of <HI>expatriation;</HI> a doctrine fir&s;t propagated by the &s;ame Frenchman, to evade the law of nations and a doctrine which never would have entered the heads of our citizens, had it not been taught by that artful &s;ophi&s;t. In giving their de|cided opinion again&s;t this article of the treaty, many ra&s;h men found them&s;elves in a dilemma, when they were informed that the article was in our treaty with France.</P>
<P>So eager were people of a certain faction to con|demn the whole treaty, that they would not give them&s;elves time to be informed whether it was right or wrong. But when they came to be told that they were re&s;trained from taking foreign commi&s;|&s;ions to act again&s;t a power at peace with the United States, by the acknowledged laws of na|tions, by an expre&s;s &s;tatute of the United States, and by an article in all our other treaties, they began to blu&s;h for their ha&s;te in giving opinions on what they did not under&s;tand. No article in the treaty is more requi&s;ite for the peace of our nation, and none more conformable to the principles of ju&s;tice between governments.</P>
<P>Vattel &s;ays, "a nation ought not to &s;uffer the citizens to do an injury to the &s;ubjects of another &s;tate, much le&s;s to offend the &s;tate it&s;elf.

<P>A nation is not accountable for every act of an individual citizen; but if a &s;tate or nation openly permits the citizens to take part with the enemies of a third nation, that third nation has a right to con&s;ider that &s;tate as making a common cau&s;e with its enemies, and to declare war again&s;t it of cour&s;e. The peace of neutral nations depends on the pro|hibitions of this article of the treaty.</P>
<P>It has been objected to this article, that it is un|con&s;titutional, as it creates the crime of piracy, when the power of defining piracy is ve&s;ted in congre&s;s. But the act of congre&s;s before mentioned, admits the right of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate to define piracy in treaties; as the 9th &s;ection enacts, "that nothing in the act &s;hall be con&s;trued to prevent the pro&s;e|cution or puni&s;hment of trea&s;on or <HI>a piracy defined by a treaty,</HI> or other law of the United States."</P>
<P>Nothing marks the partiality of a certain faction more di&s;tinctly than their objections to this article. We have had a &s;imilar article in our treaty with France more than &s;eventeen years: and in our treaties with Sweden, Pru&s;&s;ia, and the States General, more than ten years, and not a &s;yllable of objection was li&s;ped again&s;t the principle. People did not gene|rally know that &s;uch an article exi&s;ted. But the moment our government treats Great Britain with the &s;ame mea&s;ure of ju&s;tice, as we had before ob|&s;erved towards other nations, our Jacobins begin to clamor.</P>
<P>It is this popular partiality for France; this di&s;|po&s;ition to favour every thing French, at the ex|pen&s;e of every principle of ju&s;tice and equity, which occa&s;ions all the difficulty our executive has encountered in pre&s;erving our peace, and in accom|modating our differences with Great Britain. Nay more; this partiality di&s;played on all occa&s;ions, and to a degree highly improper for a neutral nation,
<PB N="255" REF="029752_0260_0FE255D7936B7F20">
has been a principal cau&s;e of the abu&s;ive treatment our &s;eamen have received from Briti&s;h privateers.</P>
<P>It is agreed on all hands, that our intere&s;t as a nation is &s;uper-eminently concerned in pre&s;erving peace. But how can peace be &s;ecured unle&s;s we treat the powers at war with impartiality and ju&s;|tice? Vattel ob&s;erves, "A neutral nation de&s;irous &s;afely to enjoy the conveniences of that &s;tate, is in all things to &s;hew an exact impartiality between the parties at war; for &s;hould one nation favour another to its detriment, that nation cannot com|plain if the other treats it as an adherent and con|federate of his enemy."</P>
<P>Our people have indeed a fine apology for &s;hew|ing a preference to France; that of favouring liberty and republicani&s;m. So far as the French fight for national independence again&s;t the combined powers, they are engaged in a ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary war, and the wi&s;hes of all Americans mu&s;t be with them. But people who think France has a republican govern|ment, or any other free government, are egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken. Nor is there as great a pro&s;pect of her e&s;tabli&s;hing a republic, as there is that &s;he is doomed to de&s;poti&s;m, or to be &s;plit into a multitude of &s;mall factious democracies, perpetually at war with each other.</P>
<P>People are, therefore, in every view, unju&s;tifiable in aiding any of the powers at war, in a manner not warranted by the laws of neutrality. As we value our own government, and the pro&s;perity of the country, we are to avoid every act which can com|mit a breach on our public peace. It is ra&s;hne&s;s and madne&s;s to combine our intere&s;t with any Euro|pean power in &s;uch a manner, as to be drawn into their political contentions. The pretence of aiding the <HI>cau&s;e of liberty</HI> is a mere artifice to catch our pa&s;&s;ions. If the nations of Europe cannot defend their liberties, we cannot be an&s;werable for their ill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ucce&s;s.

The 22d article of the treaty &s;tipulates, that in ca&s;e of injuries or damage on one &s;ide or the other, nei|ther party will authori&s;e repri&s;als, until a &s;tatement of the &s;ame, verified by proof, &s;hall be pre&s;ented to the other, and &s;atisfaction demanded. This &s;ti|pulation is in exact conformity with the law of na|tions, and is &s;upported by principles of policy and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The provi&s;ions in the 23d article are well adapted to advance the intentions of the contracting parties, and are reciprocally beneficial. The permi&s;&s;ion of American ve&s;&s;els to enter prohibited ports in ca&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s, is a conce&s;&s;ion conformable to the laws of ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>The objection to the clau&s;e which enjoins a re|&s;pect to be paid to officers according &s;o their commi&s;|&s;ions, can be rai&s;ed only by men who are de&s;titute of the civility, which enjoins that re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The 24th article prohibits foreign privateers with commi&s;&s;ions, from a prince or &s;tate in enmity with either nation, to arm or &s;ell prizes in the ports of the parties.</P>
<P>The 25th article makes it lawful for the &s;hips of war and privateers of either party to enter the ports of the other, without being liable to be &s;earched, &s;eized, or detained, or to pay admiralty fees.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;tipulations are al&s;o in our treaty with France; and no well grounded objection has been made to them. Some &s;uperficial people have &s;up|po&s;ed that they cla&s;h with our treaty with France. But there is an expre&s;s declaration that the&s;e &s;tipu|lations &s;hall not be con&s;trued to operate contrary to former exi&s;ting treaties. And if no &s;uch caution had been taken, the treaty with Great Britain could not have operated to the prejudice of France: for it is an expre&s;s law of nations. "That a &s;overeign (or &s;tate) already bound by a treaty, cannot make others contrary to the fir&s;t. The things about
<PB N="257" REF="029752_0262_0FE255DAB40206A0">
which he has entered into engagements, are no longer at his di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>"If it happens that a po&s;terior treaty is found, in &s;ome point, to contradict one that is more ancient, the <HI>new treaty is null with re&s;pect to that point</HI>&mdash;This relates to treaties with different powers." <BIBL>Vattel, B. 2. Ch. 12. Sect. 165.</BIBL></P>
<P>So far the fears of people are totally groundle&s;s. But the following clau&s;e has excited acrimonious re|marks. "The two parties agree, that while they continue in amity, neither of them will in future make a treaty that &s;hall be incon&s;i&s;tent with this and the preceding article." What can be the ob|jecton to this clau&s;e? The laws of nations, and the rules of moral ju&s;tice, forbid a &s;tate to make a &s;ub&s;e|quent treaty to infringe a prior one. No nation can do it. The pa&s;&s;age ju&s;t quoted from Vattel is expre&s;sly to this purpo&s;e: and the clau&s;e has done nothing more than convert a moral obligation into a contract, a law of nations into a conventional law between the parties. Stipulations of this kind, like &s;tatutes in affirming of common law, add the &s;anction of a po&s;itive contract to an implied one. No new obligation is created; an agreement of this &s;ort may be con&s;idered as &s;trengthening the old one.</P>
<P>The 26th artitcle provides, that in ca&s;e of war, merchants may continue to re&s;ide in the re&s;pective dominions, behaving peaceably&mdash;and in ca&s;e their conduct &s;hall render them &s;u&s;pected, the term of twelve months is allowed to &s;ettle their accounts and remove their families and effects. This is a favor|able provi&s;ion, and highly nece&s;&s;ary, between coun|tries &s;o exten&s;ively connected in commerce. The term of 12 months for removal, is longer than is u&s;ually allowed; the term generally a&s;&s;igned in trea|ties is 6 or 9 months.</P>
<P>To the two la&s;t articles, I pre&s;ume, no objections are made.</P>

<P>THUS having attempted to remove every objecti|on of con&s;equence that has been urged again&s;t the treaty, I will lay before the public a general view of our trade with the different countries of Europe, A&s;ia and the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>It has been &s;tated by the oppo&s;ers of the treaty that the commercial arrangements want reciprocity&mdash;that we concede much, and gain nothing which we did not before enjoy.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the inland trade to Canada, the conver&s;e of the propo&s;ition is the truth. The United States <HI>gain</HI> a free trade to Canada, on equal terms with Briti&s;h &s;ubject, which we did <HI>not</HI> before en|joy. Briti&s;h &s;ubjects gain little or nothing by the &s;tipulation, which they did not before enjoy. In this part of the treaty, the advantage is on the &s;ide of the United States.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to our foreign commerce, it depends on the will of nations over whom we have no con|troul. All nations claim the right of admitting &s;hips and goods into their ports, or prohibiting them at plea&s;ure; or of burdening our commerce with hea|vy duties. This right is ab&s;olute, and when we obtain any privilege in their trade, it is by way of grant or conce&s;&s;ion. The United States have the &s;ame right as to their own ports; but they have not &s;een fit to exclude the &s;hips of any nation from a free participation of their trade.</P>
<P>The maritime powers of Europe find a navy &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;afety, amid&s;t the contending in|tere&s;ts of the different nations, that every mea&s;ure is taken to multiply their &s;eamen, and increa&s;e their &s;hipping. Great-Britain is the nation mo&s;t inte|re&s;ted in this &s;y&s;tem. From her in&s;ular &s;ituation, a navy is her only defence&mdash;to man a navy, &s;he mu&s;t rai&s;e &s;eamen&mdash;to &s;ecure a &s;upply of &s;eamen &s;he mu&s;t extend her commerce and her carrying trade as far as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="029752_0264_0FE255E5D8FF4EA8">
In pur&s;uance of this &s;y&s;tem of defence, originat|ed her navagation act, in 1660, which re&s;tricts her trade to Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, and manned mo&s;tly with Briti&s;h &s;eamen. That act has been in operation from its fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ing to the pre&s;ent day; and to prevent temporary or local inconveniences, from a rigid execution, the parliament have empowered the king and council to di&s;pen&s;e with it on occa&s;ion, and open the ports of Great Britain, or her colo|nies, at &s;uch times and to &s;uch nations, as nece&s;&s;ities may require</P>
<P>All the nations of Europe have laws re&s;pecting their trade, which operate more or le&s;s to encou|rage their own commerce, and lay that of their neighbors to their own dominions under re&s;trictions.</P>
<P>A view of the privileges and re&s;trictions of com|merce, was offered to Congre&s;s, Dec. 16, 1793, by Mr. Jeffer&s;on, which, though not &s;ufficiently cor|rect or comprehen&s;ive, throws much light on the &s;ubject. The&s;e general facts will be &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e in this place.</P>
<P>The admi&s;&s;ion of our ve&s;&s;els into the Briti&s;h do|minions in Europe, re&s;ts now on an annual procla|mation of the king and council. Although intere&s;t and expedience may operate to continue the privi|lege of entering tho&s;e ports at all times, and with ve&s;&s;els of any burden, yet the tenure of the privi|lege is precarious.</P>
<P>By the pre&s;ent treaty, this precarious privilege becomes a right, which cannot be abridged by the executive of the Engli&s;h nation. This is an advan|tage; and Mr. Jeffer&s;on, in his Report, admits it to be &s;uch. It was an objection he urged again&s;t our former &s;tate of commerce to Great Britain, that it was precarious&mdash;That objection by the treaty is removed.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to her colonial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, Great Britain has ob&s;erved the jealous policy common to all the nations of Europe. The &s;hips of all nations
<PB N="260" REF="029752_0265_0FE255E765A1FCC8">
are excluded from her colonies, unle&s;s it may be a port in the We&s;t Indies, where the Spaniards are permitted to enter with logwood.</P>
<P>In opening her We&s;t Indies to American ve&s;&s;els of 70 tons burden, and her Ea&s;t India ports to American-ve&s;&s;els of any burden, &s;he has conceded a privilege, which &s;he grants to no other nation on earth. The &s;acrifice of the carrying trade on the part of the United States, to obtain admi&s;&s;ion into the Engli&s;h We&s;t Indies, is deemed more than equi|valent, and that &s;tipulation will fall to the ground. But the direct trade to the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t Indies, is generally admitted to be highly beneficial.</P>
<P>Let us contra&s;t the&s;e advantages in trade with tho&s;e we enjoy with other nations.</P>
<P>Our navigation to Spain and Portugal is free: but many of our exports are prohibited, as tobacco, and rice and whale oils to Portugal. The American trade however to Spain and Portugal is highly ad|vantageous in a number of articles. But both the&s;e countries prohibit all intercour&s;e with their colo|nial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The ports of Sweden and Den|mark are open; but the duties paid on mo&s;t of the American productions amount to a prohibition.</P>
<P>Our navigation to the United Netherlands is free; but &s;ome of the mo&s;t material articles of our coun|try, as beef, pork and bread-&s;tuff, are prohibited, as well as by Great-Britain. We can have no in|tercour&s;e with their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Ea&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>France, before the war, guaranteed to the Uni|ted States, one or more free ports in Europe, and &s;uch ports in the We&s;t-Indies as were free. In ge|neral, her We&s;t-Indies were open by an arret of the king. Even the coa&s;ting trade in France was prin|cipally carried on by foreign ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The revolution has &s;en&s;ibly varied the whole &s;cene of commerce. Nece&s;&s;ity has opened all French ports to neutral nations. But a navigation act, &s;imi|lar to that of Great-Britain, was decreed, Septem|ber

This act is &s;u&s;pended only on account of the ncce&s;&s;ities of France, her commerce being wholly dependant on neutral bottoms. The moment this act &s;hall take place, we &s;hall be cut off from all right to the trade of France, except what is guaranteed by treaty, that is, <HI>one or more free ports;</HI> and &s;uch privileges as we &s;hall be able to obtain by future &s;tipulations.</P>

<P>The National Convention, after having heard the report of their committees of marine, of com|merce, and of public &s;afety, con&s;idering that the French nation has the inconte&s;tible right of &s;ecuring by every method, the pro&s;perity of her agricul|ture, commerce and indu&s;try; that nothing has a more direct tendency to this end than a navigation act; and that in the &s;olemn declaration of this act &s;he only makes u&s;e of the &s;ame right which &s;he ac|knowledges to belong to all other nations&mdash;Decrees as follows:</P>
<P>Art. 1.

<P>On the whole, it is demon&s;trated that no country on earth yields more exten&s;ive privileges to the American merchant, than Great Britain. It is al&s;o equally demon&s;trable that Great Britain yields more privileges in her trade with the United States than &s;he grants to any other nation.</P>
<P>It has been objected to &s;everal articles of the treaty, that they are <HI>not reciprocal,</HI> becau&s;e from the circum&s;tances of the two countries, Briti&s;h &s;ubjects will be principally benefited. Thus the 9th and 10th articles are &s;aid to yield advantages to Great Eritain, without <HI>an equivalent,</HI> becau&s;e her &s;ubjects hold large tracts of land in the United States, and have debts due them to a great amount: whereas American &s;ubjects hold little or no land, and have no debts or monies, in Great Britain.</P>
<P>Objections of this kind mu&s;t proceed from a pee|vi&s;h captious di&s;po&s;ition. It may ju&s;t as well be objected that we &s;hould have no trade with Great Britain at all, becau&s;e her exports to this country exceed her imports from it&mdash;or becau&s;e her domini|ons contain double the number of people, that are in the United States. Nay, it may ju&s;t as well be aid that every man has not an <HI>equal right</HI> to a high|way,
<PB N="263" REF="029752_0268_0FE255F48145AB18">
becau&s;e &s;ome u&s;e the highway ten times as much as others.</P>
<P>In all conventions between &s;tates, an <HI>equality in principle con&s;titutes an equivalent.</HI> If an article of any treaty gives to both parties a right of doing the &s;ame things, and under the &s;ame advantages, that article is reciprocal, though one of the parties never make u&s;e of the right.</P>
<P>Thus in our treaty with France, we permit French armed ve&s;&s;els to bring their prizes into the ports of the United States. The French al&s;o per|mit the American ve&s;&s;els to carry their prizes into French ports. The French are in a condition to u&s;e the privilege and do u&s;e it every day&mdash;We are not at war, and do not u&s;e the privilege. But will any man &s;ay, that article of the treaty is not <HI>mutual?</HI> Will any man deny that we have an <HI>equivalent</HI> for the right conceded to France?</P>
<P>Ju&s;t &s;o with re&s;pect to our commerce with Eng|land or any other power. Suppo&s;e a nation to have but a &s;ingle port for &s;hipping and commerce, and the United States to have a thou&s;and. Each party agrees to open all their ports, and admit the other to a free trade; will it be denied that this is reci|procal? Certainly not. It is <HI>equality in the prin|ciple,</HI> not in the amount or extent of its operation, which con&s;titutes <HI>reciprocity.</HI></P>
<P>If people are di&s;po&s;ed to cavil at <HI>inequalities of condition,</HI> as well as of <HI>principle,</HI> they may find as many cau&s;es of di&s;content, in all other treaties, as in this with Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The truth is, when our other treaties were form|ed, Americans had confidence in the con&s;tituted au|thorities of our country. They believed men, who had made commerce, treaties, and the laws of nati|ons, a &s;tudy and matter of contemplation, were be&s;t capable of negociating treaties. They tru&s;ted to the men appointed for this purpo&s;e. The great ma&s;s of people are not competent to decide what is,
<PB N="264" REF="029752_0269_0FE255F60F3C5460">
or is not for our public intere&s;ts, in complicated negociations and national compacts; and unle&s;s they repo&s;e confidence in public characters, we &s;hall for|ever be embroiled with factions.</P>

<P>HAVING in the preceding papers, an&s;wered &s;uch objections to the treaty, as appear to have any weight, 'I will clo&s;e this vindication, by ad|dre&s;&s;ing to my fellow citizens, &s;ome con&s;iderations of a more general nature.</P>
<P>It was the public opinion the la&s;t year, and it is an opinion &s;till maintained among one de&s;cription of Americans, that Great Britain has been &s;o hum|bled by France, that &s;he will con&s;ent to make great &s;acrifices for the purpo&s;e of &s;ecuring peace and com|merce with this country. It is al&s;o believed by many people, that the kingdom is upon the point of an internal revolution: and that holding in our hands the power of &s;eque&s;trating the debts of her citizens, we may command, at all times, peace and favorable treatment.</P>
<P>All the&s;e opinions, though unque&s;tionably erro|neous, have contributed to rai&s;e the public expecta|tion, re&s;pecting the &s;ucce&s;s of the treaty, to an un|warrantable pitch.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the humble condition of Great Britain, where are the proofs? That her land forces were defeated and cut to pieces, the la&s;t cam|paign, is undeniable; and there is no que&s;tion that any combat by land, would be decided in favour of of France. The numbers, the di&s;cipline, and the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the French forces on land render them irre&s;i&s;tible. But the be&s;t troops and the be&s;t di&s;cipline, without other re&s;ources, will not main|tain the greatne&s;s of a &s;tate or kingdom, for any glenth of time.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="029752_0270_0FE255F79E769580">France now &s;upports her armies mo&s;tly upon her conquered countries. Her finances are exhau&s;ted; and what is, if po&s;&s;ible, a more &s;erious calamity, her internal di&s;&s;entions debilitate her force, di&s;tract her councils, and di&s;concert her operations.</P>
<P>The plan of Robe&s;pierre was a &s;y&s;tem of de&s;pair. By putting every thing in requi&s;ition, the per&s;ons of men, their goods, provi&s;ions, and money, the whole force of France was collected to a point, and the whole energy of that force was exerted to de|feat the mo&s;t formidable combination ever rai&s;ed again&s;t the independence of a nation.</P>
<P>This mea&s;ure was perhaps indi&s;pen&s;able in the cri&s;is when it was adopted. But unfortunately vio|lent exertions in the body politic, as well as in the human body, are ever followed by debility and lan|guor. The &s;y&s;tem of requi&s;itions and the maximum, were calculated to de&s;troy the capital of a country, which, in all ca&s;es, ought to be left untouched, as a &s;ource of further productions. The intere&s;t or in|come only of a country can be &s;afely u&s;ed for na|tional purpo&s;es; and when a &s;tate is compelled to &s;eize the capital &s;tock, though its exertions may be great, they mu&s;t certainly be of &s;hort duration.</P>
<P>But this is not the only calamity incurred by the &s;y&s;tem of terror. To enforce &s;uch an arbitrary &s;y&s;|tem, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to violent puni&s;hment, for refu&s;als to comply with it; and the &s;ummary mode of condemning, as well as the &s;anguinary proce&s;s of executing, tend to excite all the malicious and revengeful pa&s;&s;ions of men. The guillotine of France has left every deadly and rancorous pa&s;|&s;ion, waiting only for a favourable moment for ven|geance. The &s;urviving friends of tho&s;e who fell victims, to the &s;y&s;tem of terror, will not ea&s;ily for|get or forgive the injuries they &s;uffered; and thus that terrible de&s;poti&s;m, which for a few months, com|pelled all men to unite to defeat foreign foes and to cru&s;h internal in&s;urrections; that &s;y&s;tem has

&s;pread over France the &s;eeds of faction and di&s;&s;en|tion, which will afflict the country and weaken al its exertions, for at lea&s;t a generation to come. Thus the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on, the victories of France by land, a&s;toni&s;hed all nations, and &s;pread di&s;may through Europe, while her frigates &s;coured the ocean, and marred the commerce of her enemies. But the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on, her armies and her fleet are inactive, her re&s;ources fail, and all is debility and languor.</P>
<P>Great Britain, on the other hand, though her army was de&s;troyed in the Netherlands, retains all her activity and re&s;ources. Her territories have not been the &s;eat of war; her land has been under full cultivation, her manufactures have been carried on as u&s;ual, her goods are exported nearly as cheap, and in nearly the &s;ame quantities, as in time of peace; her government retains its vigour, and her fleet, notwith&s;tanding a &s;carcity of &s;eamen, &s;till rides mi&s;|tre&s;s of the ocean. The commerce of Great Bri|tain, though a little impaired, &s;till exceeds that of any other country; and the government has not been compelled to di&s;tre&s;s her trade to man her navy. Were there a pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity for &s;o violent a &s;tep, that country, by &s;tripping her merchantmen for a time, would bring upon the ocean a fleet &s;upe|rior to any that has ever appeared under one com|mand. But Great Britain has not yet been com|pelled to adopt this ruinous expedient; &s;he has not materially impaired her commerce by impre&s;|&s;ing &s;eamen&mdash;&s;he has not entrenched upon the capi|tal &s;tock of her hu&s;bandmen and manufacturers. Her debt has indeed been augmented; but &s;till im|men&s;e &s;ums of money are offered, and the only que&s;tion, with government is who&s;e money &s;hall be received on loan; for the competitors, are nume|rous. Such is the monied capital of that country, and &s;uch the re&s;ources that Great Britain will pro|bably

be able to carry on the war longer than any other power.</P>
<P>Nor is the idea of an approaching revolution, well founded. Ireland may perhaps give trouble: but the government of England has &s;eldom ever been &s;upported by a more numerous and powerful majority of the people. The private a&s;&s;ociations in England and Scotland, gave &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s for a time; but the moment government called for a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of the <HI>habeas corpus</HI> act, it was granted, and the executive di&s;&s;ipated all private &s;ocieties, with their plans of revolution. The ea&s;e with which this whole bu&s;ine&s;s was conducted, certainly does not mark either fear or weakne&s;s in the admini&s;tration of the government of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Where, then, is the ground for &s;uppo&s;ing Great Britain in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of humiliation, compel|ling her to make &s;acrifices to the United States?</P>
<P>On the contrary, Great Britain at this moment, maintains as commanding an attitude among the powers of the earth, as at any former period. All the hopes of Americans, founded on an opinion of the depre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of that nation, are wholly delu|&s;ory. Nor can we expect any thing from the gene|ro&s;ity or good will of the Briti&s;h, or any other na|tion. National genero&s;ity is a mere phantom of the imagination. It is to the intere&s;t, or, at mo&s;t, to the ja&s;tice of a nation we mu&s;t addre&s;s our&s;elves; and no nation will make conce&s;&s;ions beyond what the&s;e require. We are not in a &s;ituation to <HI>command</HI> any foreign nation, to <HI>enforce</HI> our claims, or to <HI>com|pel</HI> the exerci&s;e of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>If our &s;anguine enthu&s;ia&s;ts are mi&s;taken totally as to the pre&s;ent power of Great Britain, they are equally &s;o, as to the force and effect of &s;eque&s;tration. The inju&s;tice of attacking private debts for national wrongs, is generally admitted; but many people contend that it may be nece&s;&s;ary at times to re&s;ort to this mea&s;ure, as the only effectual weapon in our
<PB N="268" REF="029752_0273_0FE25605A6529F88">
power, to terrify Great Britain, a perfidious na|tion into a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>It is &s;urpri&s;ing how &s;uch rea&s;oners mi&s;take the real and certain effects of &s;uch a &s;tep. Any man who will give him&s;elf time to reflect on the pride of nations, and e&s;pecially of the Engli&s;h nation, mu&s;t be convin|ed, that the u&s;e of this weapon, in&s;tead of inducing conce&s;&s;ions on the part of Great-Britain, would ex|cite every ho&s;tile feeling, not only in the government, but in the very creditors who&s;e debts &s;hould be &s;eque&s;|tered. Such a violation of all good faith, &s;uch an attack upon commercial confidence, as the &s;eque&s;tra|tion of private debts, to avenge national injuries, would put it out of our power to accommodate diffe|rences but by the &s;word. It would provoke a war of double &s;ury; and the very man who&s;e debts &s;hould be detained, would be the fir&s;t to encourage and the la&s;t to abandon the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>All the high rai&s;ed expectations of our citizens of obtaining from Great-Britain in her pre&s;ent &s;tate, hu|miliating conce&s;&s;ions which her pride would forbid her to yield in time of peace, are &s;upported by not one circum&s;tance of rational probability. People who dwell on &s;uch pro&s;pects of &s;ucce&s;s, are gro&s;sly deceived, both as to facts, and as to the character of the Engli&s;h nation.</P>
<P>But Judge Rutledge of South Carolina has, on this &s;ubject, uttered the &s;illie&s;t expre&s;&s;ions that ever fell from human lips. "England (&s;ays he) is hoping for peace on whatever terms France may grant it: &s;he is reduced to the la&s;t ga&s;p, and were America to &s;eize her by the throat, &s;he would expire in agonies at her feet."</P>
<P>A man mu&s;t be little le&s;s than in&s;ane, to utter &s;uch ab&s;urd ideas, e&s;pecially at a moment when Great-Bri|tain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more actual re&s;ources, the &s;inews of war, than all the other powers at war, even France included. And no man, but an in&s;olvent debtor, who hates his creditor, becau&s;e he has injured him, would wi&s;h to
<PB N="269" REF="029752_0274_0FE25607357C4E78">
&s;ee a great agricultural, manufacturing, and commer|cial nation <HI>expiring in agonies.</HI> Whatever be the inju|juries Great-Britain has done this country, it is not for the intere&s;t of mankind, that &s;he &s;hould be blotted out of exi&s;tence. In no country on earth do the Ameri|can merchants find more good faith, fair dealing, aad convenient credit, than among Briti&s;h merchants&mdash;no creditors are more indulgent to debtors than the Bri|ti&s;h&mdash;and no country on earth finds exten&s;ive credit more u&s;eful than the United States.</P>
<P>Whatever be the re&s;entments of our citizens tow|ards Great Britain, they may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of one fact, and it is of no &s;mall moment to &s;ome of the United States, that the treatment Americans will receive from that country will be <HI>more friendly,</HI> when the conduct of American debtors is more <HI>ju&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Another objection to the treaty, or to any treaty with Great-Britain, is, that it begets an unnatural alli|ance between a monarchy and a republic. This is clearly the mo&s;t trifling objection ever offered, and is beneath a &s;erious an&s;wer. And tho&s;e who make it, ought to blu&s;h at their incon&s;i&s;tency, e&s;pecially as the&s;e very men are rejoicing at the late treaty between France and the monarch of Pru&s;&s;ia, and earne&s;tly ex|pecting every day, to hear of a treaty between France and Spain.</P>
<P>On the whole, let me a&s;k my fellow citizens what &s;acrifices we may make by the treaty?</P>
<P>We have old inveterate di&s;putes with Great-Britain, which mu&s;t be terminated. War or accommodation are the alternatives. If we wi&s;h a war, we wa&s;te the blood and trea&s;ure of America, without an object: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or at the clo&s;e of the war, the old di&s;putes will re|main, and new ones be originated. In&s;tead of better|ing our condition, we render it infinitely wor&s;e by ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>Is it not wi&s;e, therefore to compromi&s;e the&s;e differ|ences? And though con&s;iderable time and expen&s;e, perhaps &s;ome &s;acrifices of ju&s;t claims, &s;hould be incur|red
<PB N="270" REF="029752_0275_0FE25610C4DEEED8">
on our part, yet between the&s;e evils, and the con|tinuance of inveterate enmity and ho&s;tile views, on which &s;ide does the balance lie? Every reflecting man mu&s;t &s;ay. <HI>on the &s;ide of accommodation and peace.</HI></P>
<P>The commercial part of the treaty is of a tempo|rary nature; and even if &s;ome &s;acrifices were to be made, the&s;e will not come in competition with the other great and important objects of the treaty. But it is not true that any material &s;acrifice is made in the commercial part of this compact. We do not cede <HI>one material privilege</HI> which Great Britain does not en|joy by the laws of nations or the laws of the United States. I am bold in the a&s;&s;ertion, and call on my op|po&s;ers to name the part in which &s;uch &s;acrifice is made.</P>
<P>On the other hand, &s;ome <HI>material conce&s;&s;ions</HI> on the part of Great Britain, are made to the United States by the treaty.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, Great Britain may enter with her &s;hips into <HI>all</HI> the ports of the United States.&mdash;True; but &s;he enjoys that privilege <HI>without</HI> this treaty. She gains nothing in this re&s;pect except that &s;he changes a <HI>precarious privilege</HI> for a <HI>right;</HI> ju&s;t as we do, in the trade to the Briti&s;h <HI>European</HI> dominions.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, we bind our&s;elves not to increa&s;e the du|ties on Briti&s;h tonnage and goods imported in her &s;hips beyond what we lay on tho&s;e of other nations.&mdash;True; we agree on this head, to treat Great Britain as well as the mo&s;t favoured nation. If this is a conce&s;&s;ion on our part, it cannot be a <HI>material &s;acrifice,</HI> for we have an equivalent in this, that Great Britain &s;tipulates the &s;ame thing to the United States.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, <HI>we cede</HI> to Great Britain the right of in|crea&s;ing duties on our tonnage to equal our pre&s;ent duties on hers and on goods imported in Briti&s;h bot|toms. Nothing can be more puerile than &s;uch an al|legation. In this re&s;pect we <HI>cede</HI> nothing.&mdash;Great Britain had that right before the treaty; and her right is preci&s;ely the &s;ame as before.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="029752_0276_0FE256125A42ABE8">It has been &s;aid, we <HI>cede</HI> to Great Britain the right of &s;eizing our ve&s;&s;els and taking the enemy's proper|ty; and that we have <HI>made</HI> naval &s;tores and provi&s;ions contraband by treaty.</P>
<P>The&s;e charges have been proved <HI>not true.</HI> Great Britain enjoys the&s;e rights by the <HI>law of nations,</HI> inde|pendent of all treaties.</P>
<P>We have therefore made very few &s;acrifices in this part of the treaty; but we have gained &s;omething. We have obtained a permanence of trade to Great Britain. We have gained a free trade to Canada and the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t Indies, without any con&s;iderable con|ce&s;&s;ions, and what is more, we have pre&s;erved the BLESSINGS OF PEACE.</P>
<P>Why then, my fellow Citizens, will you not leave the management of this treaty where the Con|&s;titution has placed it? What ground have you to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Pre&s;ident, our late Envoy and the majority of the Senate, have, in a moment and on this &s;ingle occa&s;ion, de&s;erted the intere&s;t of our country? What rea&s;on have you to believe that old tried patriots have renounced the uniform prin|ciples of their lives, and turned apo&s;tates? Is there a &s;hadow of rea&s;on to believe, that men grown grey in the &s;ervice of their country, who&s;e patrioti&s;m and virtue were never &s;u&s;pected, have now in the evening of life, and at the clo&s;e of all their active public &s;cenes, commenced traitors? You cannot be|lieve in&s;inuations of this kind. The &s;ugge&s;tion of Briti&s;h gold and undue influence, is the work of dark malicious hearts, dete&s;ted by all good men, and di&s;credited by the very children in the &s;treets.</P>
<P>No, my countrymen, you have been deceived. Your pa&s;&s;ions have been taken by &s;urpri&s;e; you have been precipitated into ru&s;h opinions, and vio|lent mea&s;ures, by a &s;et of men who are the foes of our pre&s;ent free and happy government and its ad|mini&s;tration. You may be a&s;&s;ured, there is a con|federation of characters, from New-Hamp&s;hire to
<PB N="272" REF="029752_0277_0FE25613E93CF608">
Georgia arrayed in oppo&s;ition, either to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;ti|tution of the United States, to its admini&s;tration or to particular men in office. The oppo&s;ition of the principal men in this confederacy can be traced to &s;ome known cau&s;es, originally of a per&s;onal nature. Di&s;appointment in application for &s;ome office, or the failure of &s;ome favourite &s;cheme in their political &s;y&s;tem, has converted many of the friends of our late revolution, into determined oppo&s;ers of the general &s;y&s;tem of the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration. The&s;e men will never be contented <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill they can di&s;place the pre&s;ent officers of government, and introduce them&s;elves, their friends, and their mea&s;ures, into our councils. You may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that mo&s;t of the &s;erment rai&s;ed again&s;t the Treaty, originated with men of this de&s;cription.</P>
<P>This confederacy was formed and is &s;till maintained and &s;trengthened, by &s;preading jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;|picions among the people, who, tho' hone&s;t in their views, are very liable to be mi&s;led by artful men. One of the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful weapons ever wielded by this coalition of di&s;appointed men, is furni&s;hed them by the pre&s;ent war in Europe. The combi|nation of powers again&s;t France, which we all re|probate, is &s;aid to be a combination again&s;t <HI>liberty in general.</HI> and if France &s;hould fail of &s;ucce&s;s, it is &s;aid we &s;hall be the next object of attack.</P>
<P>This is a mere &s;ugge&s;tion of our re&s;tle&s;s men, to alarm your fears, and drive you, if po&s;&s;ible, from your neutral ground into ho&s;tilities. The &s;ugge&s;|tion was fir&s;t made by the late French mini&s;ter, who&s;e mi&s;&s;ion to this country was for the <HI>expre&s;s purpo&s;e of &s;lattering, intriging, or forcing you into the war.</HI> His in&s;tructions are clear and explicit on this point.</P>
<P>That mini&s;ter was di&s;placed, and his views coun|teracted by the firmne&s;s of our Pre&s;ident, &s;econded by the northern &s;tates. But the party which ori|ginally rallied under that man, &s;till exi&s;ts, and forms
<PB N="273" REF="029752_0278_0FE25615766621D8">
a league, co-exten&s;ive with the United States con|nected in all its parts and acting by a &s;ingle im|pul&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus, in the infancy of our empire, the bane of all republics, is already diffu&s;ed over our country, and poi&s;ons the whole body politic. Faction is a di&s;ea&s;e which has proved fatal to all popular go|vernments; but in America it has a&s;&s;umed an a&s;pect more formidable than in any other country. In an|cient republics, popular commotions were &s;udden things, excited by the emergencies of the moment, bur&s;ting in&s;tantly on the exi&s;ting government, pro|ducing a revolution, bani&s;hing a tyrant who was powerful, or a patriot who was popular, and an ob|ject of jealou&s;y to &s;ome ambitious competitor.</P>
<P>But in America, faction has a&s;&s;umed con&s;i&s;tency and &s;y&s;tem&mdash;it is a <HI>con&s;piracy perpetually exi&s;ting</HI>&mdash;an oppo&s;ition organized and di&s;ciplined, for the purpo&s;es of defeating the regular exerci&s;e of the con&s;titutional powers of our government, whenever a mea&s;ure does not plea&s;e the &s;ecret leaders of the Confederacy:&mdash;</P>
<P>My countrymen, be watchful of the progre&s;s of the a&s;&s;ociations, formed on the plan of the Jacobin Society in France. That &s;ociety was a powerful in|&s;trument in the work of demoli&s;hing the monarchy; but on the ruins of monarchy, it rai&s;ed the mo&s;t frightful de&s;poti&s;m recorded in hi&s;tory. Leagued with &s;i&s;ter &s;ocieties in every village and city of France, the Jacobins governed the Convention, Pa|ris and all France for a long time, and filled it with blood, confi&s;cation and ruin. So terrible was the tyranny of the&s;e a&s;&s;ociations, that the Convention were compelled to prohibit their meetings; but &s;o numerous are the members, and &s;o active the &s;pirit of revenge, that two or three in&s;urrections have been rai&s;ed by the Jacobins in Paris, blood has been &s;hed in various parts by that faction, they have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Toulon, a civil war is often excited
<PB N="274" REF="029752_0279_0FE24BC315AD6870">
and it &s;eems yet doubtful whether the <HI>national re|pre&s;entatives, ex private unauthorized clubs</HI> &s;hall go|vern France.</P>
<P>My countrymen, you are threatened with a &s;imi|larevil. Under the pretended ma&s;k of <HI>patrioti&s;m and watching over our liberties,</HI> private a&s;&s;ociations are formed and extending their influence over our coun|try. The popular Societies of Francedid the &s;ame. The cry of <HI>patrioti&s;m</HI> was forever on their tongue: but when they became &s;trong enough, they ruled with a rod of iron. Fire, &s;word and the guillotine were in&s;trments of their admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>Be not deceived into a belief that our citizens are incapable of &s;imilar outrages. Violent men may be found in every country, and already are the heads of our government denounced as traitors; already is our country threatened with blood and civil war.&mdash;If men who regard their rights, and who believe the con&s;titution and laws alone to be the guarantee of tho&s;e rights, do not unite and &s;how a formidable countenance again&s;t all irregular oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e laws, our whole country will be &s;peedily &s;ubject to a confederacy of men, a &s;mall minority indeed, but bold, though &s;ecret in their machinations, indefati|gable in their mea&s;ures, and determined on &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>It is not the treaty alone which is oppe&s;ed; this is a convenient in&s;trument for them to wield; but the cau&s;es of oppo&s;ition lie deeper. The treaty is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">together &s;atisfactory; but if carried into cffect, it will not be followed with any dangerous con&s;equences, except what will be created by its op|po&s;ers. If la&s;t to go peaceably into operation, it would have no general effect on bu&s;ine&s;s which peo|ple at large could feel&mdash;agriculture would &s;till &s;lou|ri&s;h; trade would be carried on as u&s;ual with little variation; national di&s;putes would be in a train of adjustment, and peace and tranqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lity would reign throughout our happy land. But if the oppo&s;ers of the treaty can po&s;&s;ibly embroil our country in ci|vil
<PB N="275" REF="029752_0280_0FE2562235293CD8">
war, it will be effected&mdash;From &s;uch a frightful calamity, may your good &s;en&s;e, my fellow citizens, pre&s;erve us!</P>
<P>Should the treaty, not be rati&s;ied, and &s;hould the con&s;equences be foreign war, the <HI>people, not the go|vernment of America,</HI> mu&s;t be an&s;werable for all its melancholy con&s;equences.</P>
<P>No period of our political life has been more cri|tical&mdash;or de&s;erving of more temper on the part of the people and of more prudence and firmne&s;s on the part of our executive.</P>
<P>One party wi&s;hes to <HI>dra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lo&s;er our alliance with France,</HI> even at the hazard of war with all the world. Our government and its &s;upporters wi&s;h for prefect neutrality towards all the powers at war&mdash;they wi&s;h for &s;trict ju&s;tice and impartiality to be pre|&s;erved towards all parties, and they wi&s;h for friend|ly intercour&s;e with all&mdash;in fine, they wi&s;h for unin|terrupted peace.</P>
<P>When parties are thus mar&s;halled, it behoves all good men to determine on which &s;ide, they will range them&s;elves.

<HEAD>REPLY of his Excellency Lord DORCHESTER to the Indians of the &s;even Villages of Lower Canada, as Deputies from all the Nations who were at the ge|neral Council held at the Miami, in the Year 1793; except the Chawauous, Miamis, and Loups.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Children,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE well con&s;idered your words, and am now prepared to reply.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="029752_0283_0FE2562EEF97FD90">Children,</P>
<P>You have informed me that you are deputed by the &s;even villages of Lower Canada, and by all the nations of the upper country which &s;ent deputies to the general council held at the Miamis, except the Cha|wauous, Miamis and Loups.</P>
<P><HI>Children,</HI></P>
<P>You remind me of what pa&s;&s;ed at the council fire at Quebec, ju&s;t before my la&s;t departure for England, when I promi&s;ed to repre&s;ent their &s;ituation and wi&s;her to the king their father, and expre&s;&s;ed my hope that all the grievances they complained of, on the part of the United States, would &s;oon be done away, by a ju&s;t and la&s;ting peace.</P>
<P><HI>Children,</HI></P>
<P>I remember all very well; I remember that they pointed out to me the line of &s;eparation, whieh they wi&s;hed for between them and the United States, and with which they would be &s;atisfied and make peace.</P>
<P><HI>Children,</HI></P>
<P>I was in expectation of hearing from the people of the United States what was required by tham; I hop|ed I &s;hould have been able to bring you together, and make you friends.</P>
<P><HI>Children,</HI></P>
<P>I have waited long, and li&s;tened with great atten|tion; but I have not heard one word from them.</P>
<P><HI>Children,</HI></P>
<P>I flattered my&s;elf with the hope that the line, pro|po&s;ed in the year eighty-three, to &s;eparate us from the United States, which was immediately broken by them&s;elves as &s;oon as the peace was &s;igned, would have been minded, or a new one drawn in an am cable manner; here al&s;o I have been di&s;appointed.</P>
<P><HI>Children,</HI></P>
<P>Since my return, I find no appearance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> remains; and from the manner in which the people of the States pu&s;h on, and act and talk on this &s;ide,
<PB N="279" REF="029752_0284_0FE25630827F9278">
and from what I learn of their conduct towards the &s;ea, <HI>I &s;hall not be &s;urpri&s;ed if we are at war with them in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent year: and if we are, a line mu&s;t then be drawn by the warriors.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Children,</HI></P>
<P>You a&s;k for a pa&s;&s;port to go to New-York; a pa&s;&s;port is u&s;ele&s;s in peace; it appears therefore that you expect we &s;hall be at war with the States before you return&mdash;you &s;hall have a pa&s;&s;port, that, whether peace or war, you &s;hall be received by the king's warriors.</P>
<P><HI>Children,</HI></P>
<P>They have de&s;troyed their right of pre-emption; therefore all their approaches towards us &s;ince that time, and all the purcha&s;es made by them, <HI>I con&s;ider as an infringement on the king's rights;</HI> and when a line is drawn between us, be it peace, or war, they mu&s;t lo&s;e all their improvements and hou&s;es on out &s;ide of it; the people mu&s;t be gone, who do not ob|tain leave to become the king's <HI>&s;ubjects;</HI> what belongs to the Indians will of cour&s;e be confirmed and &s;ecured to them.</P>
<P><HI>Children,</HI></P>
<P>What further can I &s;ay to you?&mdash;You are our wit|ne&s;&s;es, that on our part we have acted in the mo&s;t-peaceable manner <HI>and bore the language <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the United States with patience;</HI> and I believe our patience is al|mo&s;t exhau&s;ted.</P>
