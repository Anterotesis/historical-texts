<HEAD>Some Thoughts from <HI>Seneca;</HI> Again&s;t <HI>Ra&s;h Judgment</HI> and <HI>Anger,</HI>
Not to be inqui&s;itive, and hearken to<HI> Tale-Bearers, </HI>who mind every Body's Bu&s;ine&s;s, to the neglect of their own, and endeavour to part the deare&s;t Friends in the World.</HEAD>
<P>IT is good for every Man to fortify him&s;elf on his weak &s;ide: and if he loves his Peace, he mu&s;t not be Inqui&s;itive, and hearken to <HI>Tale-bearers;</HI> for the Man that is over-curi|ous to hear, and &s;ee every thing, multiplies Trou|bles to him&s;elf: For a Man does not feel, what he does not know. He that is li&s;tening after <HI>private Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> and what People <HI>&s;ay of him,</HI> &s;hall never be at Peace. How many things that are Innocent in them&s;elves, are made Injurious yet, by mi&s;con|&s;truction? Wherefore &s;ome things we are to pau&s;e upon, others to laugh at, and others again to par|don. Or if we cannot avoid the Sen&s;e of Indignities, let us however &s;hun the open profe&s;&s;ion of it; which may be ea&s;ily done as appears by many Ex|amples of tho&s;e, that have &s;uppre&s;s'd their Anger, under the Awe of a greater Fear. It is a good Caution <HI>not to believe any thing till we are very cer|tain of it,</HI> for many probable things prove fal&s;e, and a &s;hort time will make Evidence of the un|doubted Truth. We are prone to believe many Things which we are unwilling to hear, and &s;o we
<PB N="2" REF="007317_0010_102B5761C2E38468">conclude, and take up a prejudice before we our judge. <HI>Never <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a Friend unheard;</HI> or with|out letting him know his Accu&s;er or his Crime. 'Tis a common thing to &s;ay, <HI>Do not you tell that you had it from me, for if you do, I'le deny it, and never tell you any thing again.</HI> By which means, Friends are &s;et together by the Ears, and the <HI>Infor|mer</HI> &s;lips his Neck out of the Collar. Admit no Stories upon the&s;e terms; for it is an unju&s;t thing to <HI>Believe</HI> in private, and to be <HI>Angry</HI> openly. He that delivers him&s;elf up to Gue&s;s, and Conjecture, runs a great hazard; for there can be no Su&s;picion without &s;ome probable Grounds; &s;o that without much Candor, and Simplicity, and making the be&s;t of every thing, there is no living in Society with Mankind. Some things that offend us we have by report; others we &s;ee, or hear. In the fir&s;t Ca&s;e, let us not be too Credulous; &s;ome People <HI>frame Stories that they may deceive us:</HI> Others, only tell what they hear, and are deceiv'd Them&s;elves. Some make it their Sport to do ill Offices; others do them only to pick a Thank: There are &s;ome that would <HI>part the deare&s;t Friends in the World;</HI> Others love to do Mi&s;chief, and &s;tand aloof off, to &s;ee what comes on't.

By this Cour&s;e we &s;hall not be &s;o ea&s;ily impos'd upon; nor put to trouble our&s;elves about things not worth the while; as the Loytring of a Servant upon an Erand, the Tumbling of a Bed; or the Spilling of a Gla&s;s of Drink. 'Tis a Madne&s;s to be di&s;order'd at the&s;e Fooleries. We con&s;ider the thing done, and not the Doer of it. <HI>It may be he did it Unwil|lingly; or by Chance.

A Generous Pri&s;oner cannot immediately comply with all the &s;ordid, and Laborious Offices of a Slave. A Footman that is not breath'd, cannot keep pace with his Ma&s;ter's Hor&s;e: He that is over-watch'd, may be allow'd to be Drowzy. All the&s;e things are to be weigh'd before we give any Ear to the fir&s;t Impul&s;e.

We are all Members of one Body, and it is as Natural to help one another, as for the hands to help the feet, or the eyes the hands. Without the Love, and Care of the Parts, the whole can never be pre|&s;erv'd, and we mu&s;t &s;pare one another, becau&s;e we are born for Society, which cannot be maintain'd, without a Regard to Particulars.

<P>IT is a kind of Spiteful Comfort, that whoever does me an Injury, may receive one, and that there is a Power over him that is above me. A Man &s;hould &s;tand as firm again&s;t all Indignities, as a Rock does again&s;t the Waves. As it is &s;ome &s;atis|faction to a Man in a Mean Condition, that there is no Security in a more pro&s;perous; And as the Lo&s;s of a Son in a Corner is born with more Patience, upon the &s;ight of a Funeral carry'd out of a Palace; So are Injuries, and Contempts, the more tolerable from a meaner Per&s;on, when we con&s;ider, that the <HI>Greate&s;t Men,</HI> and <HI>Fortunes</HI> are not exempt. The wi&s;e&s;t al&s;o of Mortals, have their failings, and no Man living is without the &s;ame Excu&s;e.

Let us clear our &s;elves of this Evil, purge our minds, and utterly root out all tho&s;e Vices, which, upon leaving the lea&s;t &s;tring will grow again, and recover. We mu&s;t Think of every thing, Expect every thing that we may not be Surpriz'd.

<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> ANGER.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;The general Cau&s;e of Anger, is the Sen&s;e, or Opinion of an <HI>Injury;</HI> that is the Opinion either of
<PB N="6" REF="007317_0014_102B576A8091D7F0">an Injury &s;imply <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of an Injury done which we have not de&s;erv'd. Some are Naturally given to Anger; Others are provok'd to't by Occa&s;ion; The Anger of Women, and Children, is commonly &s;harp, but not la&s;ting: Old Men are rather queru|lous, and peevi&s;h. Hard Labour, Di&s;ea&s;es, Anxiety of Thought, and what&s;oever hurts the Body, or the Mind, di&s;po&s;es a Man to be Froward, but we mu&s;t not add fire to fire.</P>
<P>HE that duly con&s;iders the &s;ubject Matter of all our Controver&s;ies, and Quarrels, will find them Low, and Mean, and not worth the Thought of a Gene|rous Mind; but the greate&s;t Noi&s;e of all is about <HI>Money.</HI> This is it, that &s;ets Fathers and Children together by the Ears; Hu&s;bands and Wives; and makes way for Sword and Poi&s;on: This is that, tires out Courts of Ju&s;tice; enrages Princes, and lays Cities in the Du&s;t, to &s;eek for Gold, and Silver in the Ruins of them. This is it, that finds work for the Judge, to determine, which &s;ide is lea&s;t in the wrong; And who&s;e is the more plau&s;ible Ava|rice, the Plantiffs, or the Defendants: And what is it that we contend for all this while, but tho&s;e Baubles that make us Cry, when we &s;hould Laugh? To &s;ee a Rich old Cuff, that has no Body to leave his E&s;tate to, break his Heart for a handful of Dirt; And a Gouty U&s;urer, that has no other U&s;e of his Fingers left him, but to Count withal; to &s;ee him I &s;ay, in the Extremity of his Fit, wrangling for the odd Money in his Intere&s;t:&mdash;If all that's precious in Nature were gather'd into one Ma&s;s, it were not worth the trouble of a Sober Mind. It were end|le&s;s to run over all tho&s;e ridiculous Pa&s;&s;ions that are mov'd about Meats, and Drinks, and the matter of
<PB N="7" REF="007317_0015_102B576D474878B0">our Luxury; Nay, about Words, Looks, Actions, Jealou&s;ies, Mi&s;takes, which are all of them as Con|temptible Fooleries as tho&s;e very Baubles that Chil|dren Scratch, and Cry for. There is nothing Great, or Serious in all that which we keep &s;uch a Clutter about; the Madne&s;s of it is, that we &s;et too great a value upon Trifles. One Man flies out upon a Sa|lute, a Letter, a Speech, a Que&s;tion, a Ge&s;ture, a Wink, a Look. An Action moves one Man; A Word affects another: One Man is tender of his Family; another of his Per&s;on; One &s;ets up for an Orator; Another for a Philo&s;opher; This Man <HI>will</HI> not bear Pride, nor that Man Oppo&s;ition. He that <HI>plays</HI> the Tyrant at Home, is as <HI>gentle</HI> as a Lamb Abroad. Some take Offence if a Man a&s;k a Favour of them, and others, if he does not. Eve|ry Man has his weak &s;ide; Let us <HI>learn</HI> which that is and take a care of it; for the &s;ame thing does not work upon <HI>all Men alike.</HI> We are moved <HI>like Bea&s;ts,</HI> at the <HI>Idle appearances</HI> of things; and the fiercer the Creature, the more is it <HI>&s;tartled.</HI> The &s;ight of a <HI>Red Cloth</HI> enrages a <HI>Bull.</HI> A Shadow pro|vokes the A&s;p; Nay, &s;o <HI>unrea&s;onable</HI> are &s;ome Men, that they take Moderate Benefits for Injuries; and <HI>Squabble</HI> about it, with their neare&s;t <HI>Relations; They have done this and that for others,</HI> they cry; And <HI>they might have dealt better with us if they had plea|&s;ed.</HI> Very Good! And if it be le&s;s than we look'd for, it may be yet more than we de&s;erve. Of <HI>all</HI> Unquiet humours, this is the wor&s;t, that <HI>will</HI> never &s;uffer any Man to be happy, &s;o long as he &s;ees a happier Man than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>HOW Vain, and <HI>Idle</HI> are many of tho&s;e things that make us &s;tark Mad! A re&s;ty Hor&s;e, the over|turning
<PB N="8" REF="007317_0016_102B576FC50DB380">of a Gla&s;s; the <HI>falling</HI> of a Key, the Drag|ging of a Chair, a <HI>Jealou&s;ie,</HI> a <HI>Mi&s;con&s;truction.</HI> How <HI>&s;hall</HI> that Man endure the <HI>Extremities</HI> of Hunger, and Thir&s;t, that flies out into a rage <HI>only</HI> for the putting of a <HI>little</HI> too much Water in his Wine? What ha&s;te is there to <HI>lay</HI> a Servant by the <HI>Heels,</HI> or break a Leg or an Arm <HI>immediately</HI> for't, as if he were not to have the &s;ame power over him an hour after, that he has at that In&s;tant.</P>
<P>When we are abroad we can bear <HI>well enough</HI> with <HI>foul</HI> ways, na&s;ty Streets, noi&s;om Ditches; but a &s;pot upon a Di&s;h at home, or an un&s;wept Hearth, <HI>ab&s;olutely di&s;tracts us.</HI> And what's the Rea&s;on, but that we are Patient in the one <HI>Place,</HI> and <HI>phanta&s;ti|cally</HI> Peevi&s;h in the other? Nothing makes us more Intemperate than Luxury, that &s;hrinks at every &s;troke, and &s;tarts at every &s;hadow. 'Tis Death to &s;ome to have another &s;it <HI>above</HI> them, as if a Body were <HI>ever</HI> the more, or <HI>the le&s;s hone&s;t for the Cu&s;hion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>HOW ridiculous was that of</HI> Cyrus; <HI>who, in his de&s;ign upon</HI> Babylon, <HI>found a River in his way that put a &s;top to his March: The current was &s;trong, and carried away one of the Hor&s;es that be|longed to his own Chariot: upon this he &s;wore, that &s;ince it had ob&s;tructed his Pa&s;&s;age, it &s;hould never hin|der any Body's el&s;e: And pre&s;ently &s;et his whole Ar|my to work upon't, which diverted it into a hundred and four&s;core Channels, and laid it dry. In this Ig|noble, and unprofitable employment, he lo&s;t his Time, and the Soldiers their Courage, and gave his Adver|&s;aries an opportunity of providing them&s;elves, while he was waging War with a River, in&s;tead of an Enemy.</HI></P>
