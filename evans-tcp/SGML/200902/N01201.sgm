<HEAD>The Preface,</HEAD>
<P>IN Managing Controver&s;ies in Religion, there be two u&s;ual Artifices that frequently prove traps to catch the Injudicious Mul|titude, and &s;way more with unthinking Men than a Demon&s;tration; one is to in&s;inuate that the impleaded Opinion is contra|ry to Purity and Holine&s;s; a way to corrupt the Churches and u&s;her in degeneracy: hereby many men of tender Con&s;ciences are &s;tartled, as if there were a Snake in the Gra&s;s; the o|ther is a magnifying of &s;uch Authors, as do di&s;countenance, or &s;eem to di&s;countenance that Opinion, as if they were but one degree be|neath the Apo&s;tles, <HI>they have mens Per&s;ons in Ad|miration becau&s;e of Advantage,</HI> which proves like a Charm to many Readers, being ready to &s;wallow all with an implicit Faith. How far Mr. <HI>M.</HI> hath acted his part in the&s;e two Me|thods, is obvious to any that ob&s;erve: the lat|ter of them e&s;pecially is his proper Element. But the&s;e are but flouri&s;hes, that may rai&s;e mens Spirits, but convey no light into their Under|&s;tandings: they may &s;erve to garni&s;h &amp; adorn either Truth or Errour, but &s;trengthen neither of them. Let him but prove his Doctrine to be true, and we will believe it to be a pre&s;er|vative
<PB REF="001433_0004_0FB2F013F00D3948">of the Purity of the Church; let him but confirm his Doctrine from Divine Autho|rity, and we will receive it, whether his Au|thors, do de&s;erve their high Character or not.</P>
<P>It is no offence to me that Mr. <HI>M.</HI> has under|taken to an&s;wer me; if he could have proved my A&s;&s;ertion to be a mi&s;take, it would have been a kindne&s;s to me. I heartily de&s;ire to be led into the knowledge of the Truth; and would be as forward as any to bear a te&s;timo|ny again&s;t that doctrine, could I be convinced of any error in it. But I hope his in&s;ufficiency to accompli&s;h his de&s;ign, will prove an advan|tage to the cau&s;e of God, and be a means fur|ther to E&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch as were wavering: his Arguments though propounded in a plau&s;ible manner, and &s;et off with fair glo&s;&s;es, are too weak to bear a touch, and will appear upon Examination to have in them more of Orna|ment than of Evidence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> all along intermingles Pa&s;&s;ionate Lamentations with his Arguments; if his Argu|ments had been &s;tronger, they would have been a Vindication of tho&s;e complaints; and he had done his bu&s;ine&s;s effectually, if there had been more rea&s;on and le&s;s affection in his Book. Tho&s;e Lamentations &s;erve to &s;well the Book, and make it more in bulk, but not in weight.</P>
<P>It is my endeavour to keep my heart as far from prejudice and bias as I can, that I may be prepared to give entertainment to the Truth: which is indeed worthy of entertainment, how|ever our intere&s;ts be cro&s;&s;ed thereby, we are
<PB REF="001433_0005_0FB2F0162FF48128">directed to buy the Truth though &s;ometimes it co&s;ts us dear. On the one hand, I con&s;ider that it would be a doleful thing to Propagate an Errour, and lay a Foundation of the Cor|ruption of the Land; to &s;pread and diffu&s;e Poi&s;on that may have a malignant influence from Generation to Generation, it were better to make Retractation upon Retractation, than to be ob&s;tinate in &s;uch a way. On the other hand, I con&s;ider that it is a Service to God and his People, to clear up a Truth that has not been received, whereby a door is opened for the revival of Religion, and light held forth to deliver the People of God from &s;uch mi&s;takes, as are a means to turn many away from fearing the Lord, and it would be very blame-worthy to &s;uffer my &s;elf to be ba&s;led, with trivial Arguments, great Words &amp; angry Faces; it will quit co&s;t to &s;uffer reproach in the cau&s;e of God. I &s;hall not trouble my &s;elf to an&s;wer reflections or to retort them, but to apply my &s;elf to remove &s;uch things as are offered to darken the Truth, accounting that the Vindication of the Truth is a Vindication of my &s;elf.</P>
<P>He &s;eems to intimate as if I pretended to be a Prophet. I am far from pretending to any Prophetical Revelations; I am no <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t:</HI> I neither pretend to Revelations my &s;elf, nor depend on the Sentiments of other men, as if they were Oracles: but this I profe&s;s before the World, that God has taught me the Doctrine that I have laid down; partly by giving me a great
<PB REF="001433_0006_0FB2F019EA0EEFF0">di&s;covery of his Wi&s;dom, in bringing Nations into a Church E&s;tate, and in that way com|municating Saving Grace to his Elect; part|ly by opening my Eyes to under&s;tand the Scriptures, whereby I am abundantly &s;atisfyed that it is the cau&s;e of God that I have pleaded, and accordingly, I am bound in Spirit to pur|&s;ue it, and am contented to Sacrifice my own Name for his &s;ake, knowing that though my A&s;&s;ertion be Offen&s;ive to &s;ome beloved Bre|thren, yet it is acceptable to God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and plea&s;ing to Angels and Saints in Heaven.</P>

<HEAD>The Fir&s;t BOOK. <HI>The Que&s;tion Stated, and Mr.</HI> Mather's <HI>Arguments an&s;wered.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Laws of di&s;putation do require a fair &amp; exact Sta|ting of the controver&s;y, that nothing be made mat|ter of di&s;pute, that is not plainly affirmed, or by genuine con&s;e|quence deduced from the A&s;&s;ertions of the adver&s;ary: when men do otherwi&s;e, they are guilty of ca&s;ting unju&s;t imputations, on tho&s;e whom they oppo&s;e, they labour in vain, abu&s;e their Readers, and manife&s;t an affectation of vain glory, from a victory,
<PB N="2" REF="001433_0008_0FB2F02195D16F18">where there was no conte&s;t. Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> has greatly failed in this particular. He &s;ays, p. 3. <HI>The Que&s;tion is whether God requires Un&s;anctified Per&s;ons, while &s;uch, to come to his Table, and con&s;equently whether the Church may admit into their holy Communion in &s;pecial Or|dinance &s;uch as are not in the judgment of ra|tional Charity true Believers.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e Que&s;tions is not fair|ly laid down, my Po&s;ition is, That Sancti|fying Grace is not nece&s;&s;ary to the lawful attending the Ordinance of the Lords Supper. He &s;ays the Que&s;tion is, <HI>Whether God requires Un&s;anctifyed Per&s;ons, while &s;uch, to come to his Table.</HI> In&s;inuating as if I did affirm, that God required all Un&s;anctify|ed Per&s;ons to come to his Table. We u&s;e to &s;ay in di&s;putations, <HI>Adde Signum.</HI> He &s;hould have added the &s;ign, and either &s;aid &s;ome un&s;anctifyed per&s;ons, which I own, or all un&s;anctifyed per&s;ons which (as he knows) I utterly deny.</P>
<P>He adds, that con&s;equently, <HI>the Que&s;ti|on is, whether the Church may admit to their holy Communion in &s;pecial Ordinances, &s;uch as are net in the judgment of rational Charity true Believers.</HI> But I have no controver&s;y with him upon that account. My bu&s;ine&s;s was to an&s;wer a ca&s;e of Con&s;cience, and direct
<PB N="3" REF="001433_0009_0FB2F023455F32C8">tho&s;e that might have Scruples about Par|ticipation of the Lords-Supper, becau&s;e they had not a work of Saving Conver&s;ion, not at all to direct the Churches, to ad|mit any that were not to rational Charity true Believers; &s;o that he blots a great deal of Paper to no Purpo&s;e, beats the air, and fights again&s;t a &s;hadow of his own making.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>Mr.</HI> Mather's <HI>fir&s;t Argument.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>AS&s;ertions that are contrary to many Scrip|tures, ought not to be received by the Churches; but the impleaded A&s;&s;ertions are contrary to many Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Scripture alledged is Matt. 22.11, 12. <HI>And when the King come in to &s;ee the Gue&s;t, he &s;aw there a man that had not on a wedding Garment; &amp; he &s;aith unto him, friend, how came&s;t thou in hither, not having a wed|ding Garment? And he was &s;peechle&s;s.</HI> He &s;ays upon it, <HI>That it is evident, that they who come to the Lords Table without a Wedding Garment are Gue&s;ts more hold than welcome.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The thing to be enquired into is. What is this Fea&s;t that the gue&s;ts were in|vited to? Mr. <HI>M.</HI> &s;uppo&s;es it to be the Lords Supper: that is ea&s;ier a great deal then to prove it. It is abundantly manife&s;t that Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and Pardon &amp; Salvation are
<PB N="4" REF="001433_0010_0FB2F0246A0D7508">the Fea&s;t, that they were invited to, &amp; not the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: the Me&s;&s;engers of God are &s;ent to invite men to this Fea&s;t: and I think he will not &s;ay, that the great errand of the Mini&s;try is to invite men to the Lords Supper: be|&s;ides this is a Fea&s;t that the Jews were in|vited to from Generation to Generation, long before the Lords-Supper was In&s;titu|ted. The Jews were tho&s;e <HI>that were bid|den:</HI> v. 3. <HI>He &s;ent forth his Servants to tho&s;e that were bidden, to the Wedding, and they would not come:</HI> One &s;et of Servants af|ter another were &s;ent unto them: <HI>v.</HI> 4. <HI>Again he &s;ent other Servants:</HI> Fir&s;t he &s;ent the Prophets and then the Apo&s;tles, after this the Gentiles were invited to the &s;ame Fea&s;t, <HI>v.</HI> 9. <HI>Go ye into the high ways, &amp; as many as ye &s;hall find, bid unto the Marriage.</HI> Be&s;ides this man that had not the Wedding Garment was not &s;uffered to partake of this Fea&s;t, but &s;uch per&s;ons are &s;uffered to par|take of the Lords Supper; be&s;ides this per|&s;on that was objected again&s;t for not having a Wedding Garment, was a Reprobate, <HI>v.</HI> 14. <HI>Many are called, but few are cho&s;en:</HI> but Mr. <HI>M.</HI> dont think that every one that ven|tures to partake of the Lords Supper with|out Grace, is a Reprobate. By this it does appear that here is a repre&s;entation of the
<PB N="5" REF="001433_0011_0FB2F0284B5FF8D8">Day of Judgment, and that &s;uch Per&s;ons as come for Salvation without a Wedding Garment &s;hall be rejected in that day. So that here being nothing &s;poken about the Lords Supper, all arguing from this Scrip|ture falls to the ground. <HI>See Pools Anot. in Locum.</HI></P>
<P>Another Scripture that he urges is, 1 Cor. 11.27, 29. <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall, eat this bread &amp; drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, &s;hall be guilty of the body &amp; blood of the Lord. He that eats &amp; drinks unworthily eats &amp; drinks Damnation,</HI> (or Judgment) <HI>to him&s;elf:</HI> Hence he argues, <HI>That if the unworthine&s;s of a particular act in re&s;pect of the manner of do|ing it, may make a man guilty: how much more the unworthine&s;s of his per&s;on.</HI> This is as if he &s;hould argue that an unworthy manner of Hearing, makes a man guilty, therefore much more the unworthine&s;s of his per|&s;on, &amp; therefore gracele&s;s per&s;ons &s;hould refrain from hearing.</P>
<P>But this Scripture being a &s;tumbling-block to many, it is meet it &s;hould be more fully con&s;idered. Mind therefore.</P>
<P N="1">1. It doth not follow that if they eat &amp; drink Judgment to them&s;elves that they &s;hould forbear. Natural men Sin when they Pray, when they Hear, &s;o they did
<PB N="6" REF="001433_0012_0FB2F029C51BDC80">of old when they offered Sacrifice; and they expo&s;e them&s;elves to the Judgment of God; but it dont follow that they mu&s;t forbear.</P>
<P N="2">2. That true Believers may eat &amp; drink unworthily. The Apo&s;tle doth not &s;peak of unworthy Communicants, but unwor|ty Communicating. He &s;uppo&s;es the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> to con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch as were Believers, yet he &s;uppo&s;eth that &s;ome of them did eat &amp; drink unworthily: <HI>v.</HI> 30. He &s;ays, <HI>For this cau&s;e many among you are weak &amp; &s;ickly:</HI> yet it doth not follow that they mu&s;t forbear.</P>
<P N="3">3. Natural men may eat &amp; drink with|out that unworthine&s;s or unmeetne&s;s that the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of (1) Becau&s;e the A|po&s;tle doth expre&s;s this unworthine&s;s to lye in not di&s;cerning the Lords body. <HI>v.</HI> 29. <HI>He that eateth &amp; drinketh unworthily, eateth &amp; drinketh Damnation to him&s;elf: not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;cerning the Lords body.</HI> That is, not di&s;|ferencing that bread from common bread. (1) Becau&s;e the worthine&s;s or unworthi|ne&s;s here intended is that which may be known before hand. Therefore he advi|&s;es them, <HI>to Examine them&s;elves, v.</HI> 28. But no man can tell by any previous Examina|tion whether he &s;hall eat &amp; drink in &s;aith
<PB N="7" REF="001433_0013_0FB2F02B4F342A88">or not. A Godly man if he find the Ex|erci&s;e of faith the night before, or that Morning, may yet in his attending on the Lords-Supper be left unto a Spirit of un|belief; and a Natural man if he finds the Night before that he never had faith, may yet partake in faith. I knew one recom|mended to our Communion from another Church, as an eminent Saint, who was af|terwards fully convinced of being in a State of Nature, and at the Sacrament wought on, &amp; enabled to believe in Chri&s;t. (3) Becau&s;e the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks the&s;e words, not to re&s;train any of the Church of <HI>Co|rinth</HI> from coming to the Lords-Supper, but to direct them to come in a right man|ner, not in that rude &amp; unchri&s;tian way that they were wont to come: which he had told them of; <HI>v.</HI> 20, 21.</P>
<P>The Reverend Author adds, that the Apo&s;tles words, 1 Cor. 11.28. <HI>Let a man Ex|amine him&s;elf, and &s;o let him eat of that bread, &amp; drink of that cup: are contrary to my new doctrine.</HI> Two things he in&s;i&s;ts upon from this Scripture: the fir&s;t is, that the Exami|nation here required is, whether he has grace in his Soul; and would prove it thus. <HI>Saith he, Doth not the Apo&s;tle him&s;elf plainly tell us, what he means by this &s;elf-Examination:</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="001433_0014_0FB2F02DAAB067E0">2 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Examine your &s;elves whether you be in the faith, prove your own &s;elves, know you not your own &s;elves, how that Chri&s;t is in you, except you be reprobates; that is per&s;ons nor ap|proved.</HI> But what force is there in this Argument, doth it follow, becau&s;e by &s;elf Examination, in one place he intends their Examining whether they be in a State of grace, that therefore when ever he &s;peaks of Self Examination, the thing to be Exami|ned is the truth of grace: it is granted on all hands, that the truth of grace is to be Examined, but this doth not prove that that is the thing called for and intended, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.28. Yea it is mo&s;t evident, that this is not the Examination that they are &s;tirred up unto: if we look to the forego|ing ver&s;es where he blames them for Com|municating in a rude manner, or if we look to the <HI>&s;ub&s;equent words,</HI> where he finds fault with tho&s;e that don't di&s;cern the <HI>Lords body,</HI> it plainly appears that the Examination he called for is, whether they under&s;tood the nature of the Ordinance, that &s;o they may &s;olemly con&s;ider what they have to do when they wait upon God in it. The thing to be Examined is not the worthine&s;s of their per&s;ons, but the worthine&s;s of their participation. A &s;econd thing that he in|&s;i&s;ts upon, tho' not in this Book, yet in a|nother
<PB N="9" REF="001433_0015_0FB2F02F42854F38">that he put forth &s;ome years &s;ince, upon the like occa&s;ion, is, that the Greek word rendred <HI>Examine,</HI> does import an <HI>Examination to Approbation:</HI> &s;urely he is too critical therein, for though the Word does &s;ometimes import &s;o, yet not always: the &s;ame word is u&s;ed, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.5. &amp; rendred <HI>Prove:</HI> where the Apo&s;tle &s;aid <HI>Prove your own &s;elves.</HI> For that was not the duty of all of them to prove them&s;elves to Appro|bation. It was in the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> as in other Churches, &s;ome were &s;incere, and &s;ome were hypocrites, and it is as much the duty of hypocrites to di&s;cover their hypocri&s;y, as of Saints to di&s;cover their Sincerity: it is their duty to Exa|amine them&s;elves to di&s;approbation. Be|&s;ides if Communicants mu&s;t Examine their &s;aith to approbation, I would inquire whether by that approbation, he means A&s;&s;urance or a probable hope. If he in|tends A&s;&s;urance, then none but tho&s;e that have A&s;&s;urance may come to the Lords|Table. If he intends a probable hope: then &s;uch per&s;ons may come as are not &s;incere, and then Sanctifying grace is not nece&s;&s;ary in order to a lawful attending the Lords-Supper.</P>
<P>A third Scripture that he brings to make good his Argument is, Ezek. 44.7, 9. <HI>You
<PB N="10" REF="001433_0016_0FB2F03125845AD8">have brought into my Sanctuary &s;trangers, un|circumci&s;ed in heart, &amp; uncircumci&s;ed in fle&s;h, to be in my Sanctuary to pallute it, even my hou&s;e: when you offer my Bread, the Fat, and the Blood, and they have broken my Covenant. &mdash; Thus &s;aith the Lord, no &s;tranger uncir|cumci&s;ed in beart, &s;hall enter into my Sanctuary.</HI></P>
<P>I An&s;wer, 1. That this Scripture has no particular reference to the Lords-Sup|per. If he had blamed them for &s;uffering &s;uch per&s;ons as were uncircumci&s;ed in heart and fle&s;h to come to the Pa&s;sover, which was a Sacrament of confirmation as the Lords Supper is, he might have pleaded that it had a particular reference to the Lords Supper, but the fault was that they brought &s;trangers into the Sanctuary: but the Pa&s;sover was eaten in their own hou&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">2. The fault is charged on the Prie&s;ts, that they brought in &s;uch as were uncir|cumci&s;ed in fle&s;h &amp; in heart: therefore it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be under&s;tood of &s;uch as were vi&s;ibly uncircumci&s;ed in heart; for the Prie&s;ts were not to blame for letting in &s;uch as were vi&s;ibly circumci&s;ed in heart, though not really &s;o: for they were bound by Gods Ordinance to do it. Yea Mr. <HI>M.</HI> goes a great deal further than I
<PB N="11" REF="001433_0017_0FB2F038F64032E8">dare go, for he &s;ays, That Adulterers, Thieves, Liars, Slanderers &amp; Perjured Per|&s;ons might celebrate the Pa&s;sover, <HI>p.</HI> 75, 76. How to reconcile &s;uch practices with heart circumci&s;ion is quite beyond me.</P>
<P>Here our Reverend Author informs us, <HI>That the Jewi&s;h Ma&s;ters tell us, that their Fa|thers were very &s;trict in admitting of Pro&s;elytes, they &s;ay they admitted no Pro&s;elytes in Davids time, lea&s;t they &s;hould join them&s;elves to his Peo|ple out of fear; nor in Solomons time, lea&s;t they &s;hould come becau&s;e of the great Pro&s;perity that I&s;rael then had.</HI></P>
<P>To which I may An&s;wer in the Apo&s;tles words, 1 Tim. 1.4. <HI>Neither give beed to fa|bles.</HI> If it were really &s;o it was utterly cro&s;s to the in&s;titution of God: <HI>Exod.</HI> 12.47, 48. but undoubtedly the thing is utterly fal&s;e: <HI>David</HI> mentions the Pro&s;e|lytes in his time, as a great body of People: P&s;al. 115.12, 13. <HI>He will ble&s;s the hou&s;e of I&s;|rael, he will ble&s;s the hou&s;e of Aaron, be will ble&s;s them that fear the Lord.</HI> By them that fear the Lord, we are to under&s;tand the Pro&s;elytes. So P&s;al. 135.19, 20. <HI>Ble&s;s the Lord O hou&s;e of I&s;rael, ble&s;s the Lord O hou&s;e of Aaron, ble&s;s the Lord O hou&s;e of Levi: Ye that fear the Lord, ble&s;s the Lord.</HI> Pro&s;elytes in the Old Te&s;tament are called <HI>Fearers of
<PB N="12" REF="001433_0018_0FB2F03C03032610">God,</HI> in the New-Te&s;tament, they are cal|led <HI>Wor&s;hippers of God:</HI> Act. 16.14. And Solomon in his Prayer, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 8.41, 42. Saith, That <HI>the &s;tranger &s;hall come from afar Country, for Gods Name &s;ake, hearing of his Great Name, and his Strong Hand.</HI></P>

<P>The major is granted. There is no need to take notice of his di&s;cour&s;e upon it, becau&s;e it is a digre&s;&s;ion, and concerns not the matter in controver&s;y.</P>
<P>But the minor is utterly denyed: Some Un&s;anctifyed per&s;ons are fit to be admit|ted Members in particular Churches, they that are fit matter for Church Member&s;hip, are to be admitted: but vi&s;ible Saints tho' they are hypocrites, are fit matter for Church Member&s;hip: they that are to be admitted according to the Ordinance of God are fit to be admitted. Such as mu&s;t be admitted or el&s;e God will be greatly offended, are fit to be admitted: Such as being admitted may not be ca&s;t out, are fit to be admitted. But thus it is with vi|&s;ible Saints: though they have not a tho|row work of Conver&s;ion; &s;uch per&s;ons as God him&s;elf did admit into the Church of I&s;rael, are fit to be admitted into Go&s;|pel
<PB N="16" REF="001433_0022_0FB2F0467B96A380">Churches: &s;uch per&s;ons as the Apo|&s;tles did admit into Go&s;pel Churches are fit to be admitted into them, but they ad|mitted many that had not a thorow work of Regeneration. Indeed by the rule that God has given for admi&s;&s;ions, if it be care|fully attended, more Unconverted per&s;ons will be admitted than Converted. <HI>Mr.</HI> Cotton <HI>&s;aith, let Mini&s;ters u&s;e as much dili|gence &amp; vigilancy as well they may, yet &s;uch is the dimne&s;s of di&s;cerning in humane frailty, and &s;uch is the &s;ubtilty of many hypocrites, that it may be Ninety nine hypocrites may creep into the Church to one &s;imple &s;heep of Chri&s;t.</HI> Hol. of Ch. M. p. 67. and Preached it in <HI>Bo&s;ton, That it would be well if at the day of judgment ten men in a Church were &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> that he may &s;trengthen his Opinion heaps up many Scriptures to &s;how, that Church Members &s;hould be vi&s;ible Saints; he has no need to trouble him&s;elf to prove that which I never deny'd, all the titles that are given them don't make them more, and I never de&s;ired to make them le&s;s than vi&s;ible Saints, the members of the Chri&s;tian Church are vi&s;ible Saints, &amp; the members of the Jewi&s;h Church were vi&s;ible Saints, as they are called, <HI>Dan.</HI> 12.7.

<PB N="17" REF="001433_0023_0FB2F047B13EC7F0">to prove it, &amp; unfair by taking &s;o much pains to prove it, to leave a jealou&s;y upon &s;ome ignorant people, as if I did deny it.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aith, Hypocrites were brought in una|wars, and that they crept in unawares:</HI> but neither of the&s;e places that he refers to do intimate that all hypocrites do come in unaware: that <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.4. Speaks of &s;ome Jews that pretended them&s;elves to be Chri&s;tians but were not, but came in upon a wicked de&s;ign. Surely he does not think &s;o hardly of all that fall &s;hort of a work of Regeneration. Tho&s;e words <HI>Jude</HI> 4. are &s;poken of heretical per&s;ons: if they did take any in, that they feared had not Saving Faith, yet &s;urely none that they judged to be Heriticks. He con|tends with me for &s;aying, that Saints by Calling are to be accepted of the Church, whether they be Converted or no: &s;peaks of it as a <HI>Strange expre&s;&s;ion and a contradiction in adjecto:</HI> but what need is there of &s;o much anger. Vi&s;ible Saints are Saints by Calling. The Members of the Church of Corinth, <HI>were called to be Saints,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.2. There is an external Call and an external An&s;wer, as well as an in|ternal Call and an internal An&s;wer: If vi&s;ible Saints may be Saints by Calling,

<P>He &s;aith, That when their hypocri&s;y is di&s;covered by any fundamental Error in judgment, or &s;candal, or in Conver&s;ation, they ought to be ca&s;t out of the Church. But he mi&s;takes the matter very much: the di&s;covery of their hypocri&s;y is not the rea&s;on of their being ca&s;t out: When men are ca&s;t out of the Church we don't know that they are hypocrites or not: the rea&s;on of their rejection is becau&s;e they are ob|&s;tinate in Scandal. And Godly men are to be rejected in that ca&s;e, as well as hypocrites.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aith, That Mr.</HI> Cotton <HI>argues, that &s;uch as are de&s;tructive to the State of the Church, are not fit Materials for the building of the Church.

<PB N="19" REF="001433_0025_0FB2F04AB8CAECD8">authority, by their prudence &amp; zeal, by their E&s;tates; and it would be exceeding difficult for the Church to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them. When he &s;aith that they are de|&s;tructive to the State of the Church, does it not reflect on the Wi&s;dom of God in binding and commanding his Church to admit &s;uch Members? That con&s;titution of the Church that God has appointed, is &s;uch as makes for the &s;afety and well be|ing of the Church: and God has appoin|ted that vi&s;ible Saints &s;hall be accepted as Members of the Church, though they be not Regenerate; and the Apo&s;tles them|&s;elves accepted &s;uch.</P>

<P><HI>IF men meddle with that which they have no right unto, they have not a divine allow|ance for their doing &s;o: But when Un&s;anctify|ed Per&s;ons come, they meddle with that, which they have no right unto.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The minor is denyed. In the pro&s;ecution of it there is a great deal of confu&s;edne&s;s and ob&s;curity: Sometimes he &s;peaks of them that are Unregenerate and have no right before God, though they have before men: &s;ometimes he &s;peaks

The blood of Chri&s;t has obtained for you the remi&s;&s;ion of your Sins: and of giving the Sacrament to tho&s;e who are not &s;o far as men can judge in a Regenerate E&s;tate: and he &s;aith, that this is to &s;et the Lords Seal to a blank. But I will labour to an&s;wer the intent of this argument, &s;o far as I am able to reach it.</P>
<P>That which I am to &s;hew is, That &s;ome Un&s;anctifyed men have a right before God to the Lords Supper. Surely the Children of I&s;rael had a right before God to the Pa&s;sover; when God commanded them to celebrate it; and they had a right to Circumci&s;ion, when God commanded <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> to circumci&s;e them. And tho&s;e that are the Covenant People of God have a right <HI>to keep the Covenant;</HI> we are com|manded <HI>to teach &s;uch as are bapti&s;ed to ob&s;erve all things that Chri&s;t hath commanded,</HI> Mat. 28.19, 20. The &s;econd Command requires men to ob&s;erve and keep pure &amp; intire all &s;uch Religious Wor&s;hip &amp; Ordinances as God requireth in his word.</P>
<P>If I may gather up what he aims at, I would reduce it to the&s;e two heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. That Unregenerate men are not in Covenant with God. This is a great
<PB N="21" REF="001433_0027_0FB2F0585A51A3F0">mi&s;take, tho' Unregenerate men are not in the internal, they have not performed any act of Saving Faith, which is the con|dition of the Covenant, and God is not bound to give Saving Ble&s;&s;ings of the Co|venant to them: yet they are in the ex|ternal Covenant. <HI>Mo&s;es &s;aith, the Lord our God made a Covenant with us in Horeb,</HI> Deut. 5.2. And when he renews his Covenant, he is &s;aid to <HI>betroth them to him&s;elf,</HI> Ho&s;. 2.19, 20. And therefore the Adoption is &s;aid to belong to them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.4. They are his People, his Sons &amp; Daughters, his Spou&s;e, and he becomes their God, he makes pro|mi&s;es unto them upon condition of Obe|dience, and they promi&s;e Obedience un|to him. Hence they become capable of breaking Covenant; they have <HI>broken the everla&s;ting Covenant,</HI> I&s;ai. 24.5. <HI>Neither were they &s;tedfa&s;t in his Covenant,</HI> P&s;al. 78.37.</P>
<P N="2">2. That becau&s;e they have no right to the ble&s;&s;ings of the New Covenant, there|fore they have no right to the Seal. That the Sacrament may not be given to them becau&s;e their Sins are not pardoned: they have no right to Salvation, therefore not to the Seal of Salvation, if the Seal be given to them, it is the &s;etting of the Lords Seal to a blank: Sealing a Pardon to tho&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="001433_0028_0FB2F05B2AF35898">whom the Lord hath not pardoned.</P>
<P>An&s;w. <HI>To this I make an&s;wer in three particulars,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That tho' Unregenerate men have no right to pardon of Sin &amp; Salvation, yet they may have a right before God unto the Seals of the Covenant; they had a right to Circumci&s;ion: <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 5.2. yet that was a Seal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.11. So they had right to the Pa&s;so|ver, and &s;o they have to Bapti&s;m. It is unrea&s;onable to think that all Bapti&s;ed Children are Regenerate: and &s;o they may have a right to the Lords Supper.</P>
<P N="2">2. That Unregenerate men may have in conjunction with other, a right to &s;ome of the ble&s;&s;ings of the Covenant. The Sacra|ments are Seals of the whole Covenant, not only tho&s;e promi&s;es that are made to particular Believers, but the promi&s;es of outward pro&s;perity that are made to the vi&s;ible Church: &amp; men that are Unrege|nerate in Conjunction with others, have a right as part of the body Corporate to tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, and may receive the Seal thereof.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the Sacraments do not Seal up Pardon and Salvation to all that re|ceive them, but they are Seals to the truth
<PB N="23" REF="001433_0029_0FB2F05CC1DFACE0">of the Covenant. It doth not Seal mens having of faith, neither doth it Seal the Salvation of the Communicants; they mi|&s;erably deceive them&s;elves, if they under|&s;tand it &s;o: but it is a Seal to the Covenant. God offers Pardon and Salvation through faith in Chri&s;t, men are ready to doubt of the truth of this; but God Seals this Co|venant in the Sacraments. This is that which is intended when it is &s;aid, That Circumci&s;ion was a <HI>Seal of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith,</HI> Rom. 4.11. Whether we under&s;tand by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith, Faith it &s;elf, which is our Evangelical righteou&s;ne&s;s, or the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, which is <HI>Faith</HI> apprehended by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> it comes to one &amp; the &s;ame: and circumci&s;ion Seals the effi|cacy of this unto Salvation; that the pro|mi&s;e that he has made &s;hall in this way be fulfilled: and this is a great incourage|ment to draw forth the Exerci&s;e of Faith.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. Mather's <HI>Fourth Argument.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>IF the Sacrament were a Converting Ordi|nance, and that therefore Unregenerate Per|&s;ons &s;hould come to it in order to their being Con|verted, there would doubtle&s;s be &s;ome promi&s;e or &s;ome example recorded in the Scripture of per&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="24" REF="001433_0030_0FB2F05E2EC89BB8">&s;o Converted for the encouragement of others. But there is neither Promi&s;e nor Example.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Both parts of this argument are to be denyed. And there is very little &s;aid for the proof of either.</P>
<P N="1">1. I deny the Con&s;equence. It may be a Converting Ordinance, though there be neither promi&s;e nor example. I may ar|gue as well, that if there be no promi&s;e in the word of the Edification of Saints an|nexed to it, nor any Example of Saints edifyed thereby, then it is no Ordinance for the Edification of Saints. Yea I may as well argue that there is no promi&s;e of converting Grace, annexed to circumci&s;i|on, nor any Example of Per&s;ons Conver|ted by it, therefore that was no Ordinance for Conver&s;ion. But there be other things that do &s;hew it to be a converting Ordi|nance, as the command given to the Church, which doth con&s;i&s;t partly of men Converted, partly of men Unconverted, to attend this Ordinance. 1 Cor. 11.24, 25. <HI>This do in remembrance of me,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. I deny the Minor al&s;o. There be general promi&s;es that do reach the ca&s;e: Prov. 8.34. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the po&s;ts of my doors:</HI> This being one of the
<PB N="25" REF="001433_0031_0FB2F060A6EE00E0">ways of Gods appointment, this promi&s;e is an encouragement to wait upon God in this way. Mat. 28.20. <HI>Teaching them to ob|&s;erve all things that I have commanded, &amp; lo I am with you alway even to the end of the world;</HI> this is one of Chri&s;t commands. Rom. 10.14. <HI>Faith comes by hearing.</HI> In this Ordinance the Go&s;pel is proclamed; and Pardon is offered to Sinners by Je&s;us Chri&s;t: P&s;al. 19.7. <HI>The Law of the Lord is perfect converting the Soul.</HI> This is one of Gods laws.</P>
<P>This Ordinance has a proper tendency in its own nature to Convert men. Here|in men may learn the nece&s;&s;ity &amp; &s;uffici|ency of the Death of Chri&s;t in order to Pardon. Here is an affecting offer of Chri&s;t crucifyed; here is a Sealing of the Covenant, that if men come to Chri&s;t, they &s;hall be Saved, which is a great means to convince of &s;afety in coming to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>All Ordinances are for the Saving good of tho&s;e that they are to be admini&s;tred unto. This Ordinance is according to In&s;titution to be applyed to vi&s;ible Saints, though Unconverted, therefore it is for their Saving good, and con&s;equently for their Conver&s;ion.</P>

<P>THis Argument is thus pre&s;aced, That <HI>it is a clear confutation of what</HI> Mr. S. <HI>affirms:</HI> we will &s;ee it. <HI>If the Lords Supper be a converting Ordinance than prophane Per|&s;ons ought to be admitted to partake of it: but &s;uch are not to be admitted to the Lords Supper.</HI> He &s;aith Mr. S. <HI>him&s;elf confe&s;&s;eth thus much.</HI> And it is very true, I wi&s;h I could &s;ay, that Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> did confe&s;s, that prophane Per|&s;ons might not be admitted to the Pa&s;sover.</P>
<P>I utterly deny his Con&s;equence. His rea&s;on for it is, <HI>That we may not withold from the prophane&s;t per&s;on in the world, that which is appointed to be the means of his Con|ver&s;ion.</HI> But his con&s;equence is as &s;trong as a rope of Sand: May we not as well argue that if Bapti&s;m be a Converting Or|dinance, we &s;hould Baptize the <HI>Indians,</HI> and other Heathens, as <HI>John Hircanus</HI> did compel the <HI>Edomites</HI> to be circumci&s;ed.</P>
<P>My an&s;wer was and is, that the Lords Supper is a Converting Ordinance, only for Church Members and not for other men. He hath three objections again&s;t my an&s;wer. One is, <HI>that it is an odd one.</HI> I hope it is not criminal to give an odd
<PB N="27" REF="001433_0033_0FB2F063A0900F40">an&s;wer, and if &s;o, let it go for an odd one. The &s;econd is, <HI>that it is new of mine own invention.</HI> It is no &s;ufficient ground to reject his notions becau&s;e they are other mens, or to reject mine becau&s;e they are my own: it is for God to reveal his mind to any whom he plea&s;es: but the main objection is, <HI>That I do not prove it.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now further vindicate that an|&s;wer, that it is for the Conver&s;ion of or|derly Church Members, by laying down three Propo&s;itions, which Mr. <HI>M.</HI> him&s;elf will own.</P>
<P N="1">1. The efficacy of the Lords Supper does depend upon the ble&s;&s;ing of God. What ever tendency Ordinances have in their own nature to be Serviceable to men, yet they will not prevail any further than God doth ble&s;s them. <HI>The weapons of our warfare are mighty through God,</HI> 2 Cor. 10.4. It is God that teaches men to profit, and makes them profitable and &s;erviceable to mens Souls.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is rea&s;on to hope for adivine ble&s;&s;ing on the Lords Supper, when it is admini&s;tred to tho&s;e that it ought to be admini&s;tred unto. Gods ble&s;&s;ing is to be expected in Gods way: if men act ac|cording to their own humours &amp; phan&s;ies,
<PB N="28" REF="001433_0034_0FB2F0666B1F46B0">and don't keep in a way of Obedience, it is pre&s;umption to expect Gods ble&s;&s;ing. Mat. 15.9. <HI>In vain do they wor&s;hip me teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of men:</HI> but when they are admitted to the Lords Sup|per that God would have to be admitted, there is ground to hope that he will make it profitable.</P>
<P N="3">3. That it is Gods will that &s;uch as are in the judgment of rational Charity Be|lievers, be admitted to the Lords Supper, tho' they be Unregenerate: God allows his Church to accept of &s;uch Unregenerate men as carry them&s;elves &s;o, that there is rea&s;on to look upon them to be Saints, he would not have his Church to admit tho&s;e that are prophane, that would be a great offence to him; but the Apo&s;tles did receive tho&s;e that were to Charity Be|lievers, and Churches now ought to re|ceive &s;uch, what-ever they be in reality. From the&s;e things it is mo&s;t apparent that the Lords Supper may be looked on a Converting Ordinance, for Church Mem|bers that carry orderly, yet not for pro|phane Per&s;ons.</P>

<HI>I An&s;wer,</HI> Here is a great deal of &s;ha|dow and little &s;ub&s;tance. The practice in the Primitive Church about the time of <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> was full of Vanity &amp; Super&s;tition.

<P>Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> blames me for &s;aying, That it is not to be imagined, that all that were Baptized by <HI>John</HI> were Regenerate; or judged by him to be &s;o: and &s;aith, I do not confirm my A&s;&s;ertion with any rea|&s;on. <HI>p.</HI> 65.

<P>Mr. <HI>Charnocks</HI> arguments are of two &s;orts; the fir&s;t &s;ort are to prove that Un|regenerate Per&s;ons may not come to the Lords Supper.</P>
<P N="1">1. Arg. <HI>The Lords Supper is Childrens bread. An&s;.</HI> If &s;o then it does belong to the vi&s;ible People of God, whether they be Regenerate or no. Deut. 14.1. <HI>Ye were the Children of the Lord your God.</HI> I&s;a. 1.2. <HI>I have brought up Children.</HI> Jer. 3.14. <HI>Turn O back&s;liding Children.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Arg. <HI>For Unregenerate Per&s;ons to come to the Lords Supper is a mocking of God.</HI> An&s;. It is no more a mocking of God than for &s;uch Per&s;ons to pray; by this argument they may not Pray.</P>
<P N="3">3. Arg. <HI>An Unregenerate man is not in Covenant with God, becau&s;e he has no faith, which is the condition of the Covenant, therefore has no right to the Seal of the Covenant.</HI> An&s;w. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.

Deut. 5.2 <HI>The Lord our God made a Covenant with us in </HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> therefore they have a right to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Covenant. 3. Ma|ny Unregenerate men have a right to the offer of the internal Covenant, and &s;o they may have a right to the Seal of it, which does Seal the truth of the Covenant, and al&s;o Seals the Spiritual and Eternal ble&s;|&s;ings of the Covenant, not ab&s;olutely, but conditionally.</P>
<P N="4">4. Arg. <HI>An Unregenerate man is dead: what has a dead man to do with a fea&s;t?</HI> An&s;. Tho&s;e that are Spiritually dead are called upon to believe, which is a feeding upon Chri&s;t. So that they have to do with a Fea&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">5. Arg. <HI>The Sacrament is an Ordinance of inward Communion with Chri&s;t.</HI> An&s;. So was the Pa&s;sover, yet Unregenerate men might partake of that; and Unregenerate men when they come to the Lords Supper are capable of believing, and &s;o having com|munion with Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">6. Arg. <HI>Freemen only have a right to the Priviledges of the city: and true Chri&s;tians to the Priviledges of the Church.</HI> An&s;. The
<PB N="48" REF="001433_0054_0FB2F0A34E829D68">Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> and other Gentile Churches, <HI>Were fellow-citizens with the Saints, and of the Hou&s;ehold of God,</HI> Eph. 2.19. When he &s;aith fellow citizens with the Saints; he means fellow citizens with the Jaws: but neither all the profe&s;&s;ing Gen|tiles, nor all the Jews were Regenerate men.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ort of Arguments are to prove, that the Lords Supper is not a Con|verting Ordinance.</P>
<P N="1">1. Arg. <HI>Bapti&s;m is not a Converting Ordi|nance, much le&s;s this of the Supper.</HI> An&s;. Bap|ti&s;m is a Converting Ordinance two ways. 1. God gives Grace to the Children in this way. Some in their Infancy: thus we hope for &s;ome that dye in Childhood; &s;ome afterward. 2. The con&s;ideration of their being Bapti&s;ed, is a means to help for|ward their Conver&s;ion, by convincing, a|wakning and incouraging of them. He would prove, that <HI>Bapti&s;m is not a Conver|ting Ordinance, becau&s;e Circumci&s;ion was to Abraham a Seal of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith, which he had when he was Uncircumci&s;ed,</HI> Rom. 4.11. But tho' Abraham had faith before he was Circumci&s;ed, yet it don't follow that <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> had, that all his Male Servants had; and others in future times.</P>
<P N="2">2. Arg. <HI>Bread &amp; Wine are not to enloven
<PB N="49" REF="001433_0055_0FB2F0A5A1C98D28">a Dead man, but to nouri&s;h a living man, Chri&s;t is offered here as Spiritual food, and &s;piritual food &s;uppo&s;eth a new birth.</HI> An&s;. The con|&s;equence is to be denyed: for the&s;e three rea&s;ons. 1. Becau&s;e this Argument lyes as &s;trong again&s;t the Pa&s;sover's being a Converting Ordinance as the Lords Sup|per. 2. Becau&s;e Chri&s;t being offered as &s;piritual food, is a &s;pecial incouragement unto the fir&s;t act of faith, which is actual Conver&s;ion, if Chri&s;t offers to nouri&s;h us up to eternal life, that draws us to accept of him. 3. The Lords Supper repre&s;ents Chri&s;t as the bread of Life, as he is; and then it is a Converting Ordinance. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e he is not only, a life &s;upporting, &s;trengthning, nouri&s;hing and increa&s;ing bread, but a life giving bread. Joh. 6.48.53. <HI>I am that bread of life, except ye eat the fle&s;h of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</HI> And life is given in Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">3. Arg. <HI>Pre-examination implies that it is no Converting Ordinance.</HI> An&s;. It implies no &s;uch thing, becau&s;e this Examination is about di&s;cerning the nature of the Or|dinance: about <HI>di&s;cerning the Lords body,</HI> 1 Cor. 11.29.</P>
<P N="4">4. Arg. <HI>The nature of Excommunication
<PB N="50" REF="001433_0056_0FB2F0A6EED326F0">&s;hews it to be no Converting Ordinance. If it were a Converting Ordinance, the Ince&s;tuous Corinthian, &s;hould rather have been kept in the Church then ca&s;t out.</HI> An&s;. 1. Though it be a Converting Ordinance, yet only to orderly Members; the cen&s;ures are for the Conver&s;ion of di&s;orderly ones, in ca&s;e they be Unconverted. 2. The Argu|ment is as &s;trong again&s;t its being a &s;treng|thing Ordinance. The Corinthian if he were a godly man, as Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> &s;uppo|&s;es, had then need to be kept in the Church that his Grace might be &s;trengthned.</P>

<HEAD>The Third BOOK. <HI>Arguments to prove that Sanctifying Grace is not nece&s;&s;ary, in order to a lawful partaking of the Lords Supper, with a Vindication of them from the Exceptions of</HI> Mr. Mather.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ARgument. <HI>If Un&s;anctifyed Per&s;ons might lawfully come to the Pa&s;sover, then they may lawfully partake of the Lords Supper: But they might lawfully come to the Pa&s;sover.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="001433_0057_0FB2F0A8931D4B98">
This is evident, becau&s;e the whole Con|gregation of I&s;rael were to keep it, and &s;uch Strangers among them as did &s;ubject them&s;elves to Circumci&s;ion, <HI>Exod.</HI> 12.47, 48. And God threatens &s;uch Per&s;ons as neglect it, except they were Unclean or in a Jour|ney. <HI>The man that is clean and not in a jour|ney, &amp; forbeareth to keep the Pa&s;sover, even the &s;ame Soul &s;hall be cut off from his People,</HI> Numb. 19.13. The want of Sanctification never was alledged by any man, as a rea&s;on for forbearing the Pa&s;sover. Un&s;anctify|ed Jews did &s;in when they attended the Pa&s;sover, becau&s;e they did it not in a gra|cious manner: &s;o they did when they at|tended any other duty of Wor&s;hip, but the attending of this Ordinance was no Sin, nor ever charged on them as Sin in the Scripture: it would have been a great tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion if they had neglected it. There were many times, when there were very few godly men among them. P&s;al. 12.1. <HI>Help Lord for the godly man cea&s;eth, the faithful fail, from among the children of men.</HI> I&s;ai 53.1. <HI>Who birth believed our report &amp; to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed.</HI> Yet the Pa&s;sover was to be attended by the whole Congregation of I&s;rael: there was no re&s;triction laid upon them in <HI>Hezekiah's</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="001433_0058_0FB2F0AC25071870">time, or <HI>Jo&s;iah's</HI> time, and their practice is &s;poken of as matter of commendation.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence is likewi&s;e good. If the want of Sanctification, did not make it unlawful for men to come to the Pa&s;s|over: Then it don't make it unlawful for men to come to the Lords Supper. The Pa&s;sover is a Sacrament as well as the Lords Supper, therefore <HI>Chri&s;t is called our Pa&s;so|ver,</HI> 1 Cor. 5.7. <HI>Chri&s;t our Pa&s;sover is Sacrifi|ced or us.</HI> In the Pa&s;sover Chri&s;t is re|pre&s;ented, and it is as well as Circumci|&s;ion a Seal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith. If it be unlawful for Un&s;anctifyed per&s;ons to partake of the Lords Supper, becau&s;e that is a &s;ign of Chri&s;t Crucifyed, it would on the &s;ame account have been unlawful to have partook of the Pa&s;sover, for that likewi&s;e was a &s;ign of Chri&s;t Crucifyed. If it were unlawful, becau&s;e it is an holy Ordinance; then they might not have come to the Pa&s;sover, for that was an holy Ordinance al&s;o. If it be unlawful becau&s;e therein Saints have communion with Chri&s;t, it would upon the &s;ame account have been unlawful to have come to the Pa&s;sover; for Saints therein had commu|nion with Chri&s;t. If it were unlawful, becau&s;e the Sacrament of the Lords Sup|per
<PB N="53" REF="001433_0059_0FB2F0B2458C9BC8">is a Sacrament of confirmation, then it would have been unlawful to have per|took of the Pa&s;sover, on the &s;ame account: the Pa&s;sover &amp; the Lords Supper are like figures, one of Chri&s;t to come, the other of Chri&s;t already come: and when Chri&s;t aboli&s;hed one, he in&s;tituted the other in the room thereof. It &s;eems to me that many Per&s;ons do make an idol of the Lords Supper; crying it up above all Ordinances both of the Old &amp; New Te&s;tament, as if it were as peculiar to Saints as heavenly glory, and to be attend|ed with more reverence than all other Or|dinances. It may be this is &s;ome of the relicks of Popi&s;h Idolatry, in making the Bread &amp; Wine to be the natural Body &amp; Blood of Chri&s;t. They do by the Lords Supper as &s;ome men do by the Name of Je&s;us, they bow to that, but not to the Name of Chri&s;t, or God, or the Holy Gho&s;t. So the&s;e Per&s;ons have a greater reverence for this than any other holy Ordinance. It concerns them to &s;ee that there be no Super&s;tition in it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> makes three exceptions a|gain&s;t this Argument.</P>
<P N="1">1. Exception. <HI>That the Church of the Jews was National: &amp; the Church now is Congre|gational:</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="001433_0060_0FB2F0B5885938E8">and he depends on Dr. <HI>Goodwin</HI> to make it good.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> There is no oppo&s;ition between the Churches being National &amp; yet Congre|gational. The whole Nation may be a National Church, and the &s;everal Congre|gations may be Congregational Churches, as the &s;everal Synagogues of the Jews were.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why we have no account of any National Church among the Gentiles, is becau&s;e there was no Nation Converted to the Chri&s;tian &s;aith, during that time; which we have the Hi&s;tory of, in the New Te&s;tament: there were a few in one City and a few in another that did receive the Chri&s;tian faith: but the bulk of the &s;everal Nations lay in their heatheni&s;m.</P>
<P>At the Jews were a National Church of old, &s;o when they return, they will be a National Church again, and as they will be a National Church, &s;o Gentile Nations that profe&s;s the true Religion, are Natio|nal Churches. His objection that then there mu&s;t be an High Prie&s;t is frivolous. If he had argued that then there mu&s;t be a National Church Government, he had argued right; becau&s;e I&s;rael was a Natio|nal Church they had an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Sane|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">rim,</HI> but they had an High-Prie&s;t on a|nother
<PB N="55" REF="001433_0061_0FB2F0B6B7DE4EA0">account, <HI>viz</HI> to typify Chri&s;t as the High-Prie&s;t of our Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A Nation that is in Covenant with God is a National Church, a Nation that are in Covenant with God are the People of God, bound jointly and &s;everally to keep Covenant with him. God is one party in the Covenant, and they are the other, and being bound together to keep Covenant, the whole mu&s;t have power over the parts, to rectify all Mal-admini&s;trations, and to &s;ee the Covenant kept: it need not &s;eem &s;trange to any to hear of a National Church in the time of the New-Te&s;tament, con&s;i|dering how it was foretold by I&s;aiah: <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 19.24, 25. <HI>In that day I&s;rael &s;hall be the third with Egypt, and with A&s;&s;yria, whom the, Lord of ho&s;ts &s;hall ble&s;s, &s;aying, ble&s;&s;ed be Egypt my People, A&s;&s;yria the work of my hands, and I&s;rael my inheritance.</HI> And how it was fore|told by Chri&s;t: <HI>Matt.</HI> 13.33. <HI>The kingdom of Heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three mea&s;ures of Meal till the whole was leavened.</HI> Though few entertain the Go&s;pel at fir&s;t, yet the whole Country in a while are brought to entertain it. What is a National Church but a Profe&s;&s;ing Na|tion jointly bound to keep Covenant with God.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="56" REF="001433_0062_0FB2F0B8E8EA6550">
2. Exception. <HI>Though Go&s;pel my&s;teries were typifyed by the Po&s;sover, yet it was in&s;ti|tuted in &s;pecial, to be a commemoration of the deliverance out of Egypt, and &s;o the whole Na|tion were to partake of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> If when he &s;aith, it was in &s;pecial to be a commemoration of the deliverance out of Egypt, he intends no more. 1. Then this, that be&s;ide its typifying Go&s;pel my&s;te|ries, it had a particular re&s;pect to the de|liverance out of Egypt; there is no force at all in the exception, if it had &s;ome re&s;|pect to that, that hindred not the Sacred|ne&s;s of the Ordinance, neither could it be a rea&s;on why Un&s;anctifyed per&s;ons &s;hould come to that Ordinance, more than to any now in the time of the New-Te&s;ta|ment; the re&s;pect is had to the deliverance out of Egypt, does not de&s;troy the re&s;pect it had to the Redemption by Chri&s;t: its being a Memorial of the deliverance from Egypt, don't hinder it from being a Seal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith, nor make it fit to be attended by &s;uch as may not at|tend the Lords Supper. 2. If when he &s;aith, it was in &s;pecial to be a commemo|ration of the deliverance from Egypt, he means that it was e&s;pecially, or principal|ly in&s;tituted for that end, to be a Memo|rial
<PB N="57" REF="001433_0063_0FB2F0BB2D73F4B0">of that deliverance from Egypt; &s;urely he did not Write tho&s;e words in cold blood: the deliverance out of Egypt was a great Mercy, but &s;mall in compari|&s;on of the deliverance by Chri&s;t: if the great thing was to be a Memorial of the deliverance from Egypt, why was there not &s;uch another Ordinance in&s;tituted, when they were delivered from Babylon; if that were the great thing why was it abo|li&s;hed after Chri&s;ts &s;uffering? can it enter into any mans heart, to think that the ty|pifying the Redemption by Chri&s;t was only a thing by the by in this in&s;titution? is that deliverance from Egpyt the prin|cipal thing intended in the preface to the ten Commandments? <HI>Exod.</HI> 20.2.</P>
<P N="3">3.

<P>And he teaches me what to an&s;wer, <HI>viz. That more po&s;itive fruits of Regeneration are required in the Church Members of the New Te&s;tament than the Old.</HI> But I dare not give that an&s;wer, becau&s;e of the ab&s;urdity of it:

<P>But this I an&s;wer, that he does greatly reproach the Church of I&s;rael: he pre|tends to endeavour the purity of Go&s;pel Churches, but obtrudes that upon us which is crude and indige&s;ted, as if all &s;orts of vile per&s;ons might according to divine In&s;titu|tion, live in communion with the Jewi&s;h Church: as if the Church of I&s;rael were like Babylon a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. I know there were great corruptions many times among them, but &s;urely vi&s;ible Saints were always <HI>de jure,</HI> the matter of Church Members: So I&s;rael are often called: Deut. 33.3. <HI>All his Saints are in his hands:</HI> So David calls them: P&s;al. 111.1. <HI>I will prai&s;e thee in the A&s;&s;embly of the Upright and in the Congregation.</HI> And he teaches us, <HI>That holine&s;s becomes Gods Hou&s;e for ever,</HI> P&s;al. 93.5. And not only as Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> &s;aith, in the time of the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>God appointed in the Church of I&s;rael a way for the removal of Scandals. For,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="59" REF="001433_0065_0FB2F0BEF299DF68">
1. Men were required in ca&s;e of Sin to offer up their Sacrifices: as is abundant|ly evident from the Law of Mo&s;es. Lev. 6.6, 7. <HI>He &s;hall bring his tre&s;pa&s;s offering unto the Lord, and the Prie&s;t &s;hall make attonement for him before the Lord, and it &s;hall be forgiven him.</HI> This offering of Sacrifice was to be attended with confe&s;&s;ion. Lev. 5.5. <HI>He &s;hall confe&s;s that he hath &s;inned in that thing, &amp; he &s;hall bring his tre&s;pa&s;s-offering unto the Lord for his &s;in.</HI> Numb. 5.6, 7. <HI>When a man or wo|man commit any &s;in, that men commit, then they &s;hall confe&s;s their &s;in that they have done.</HI> Hereby the Scandal was removed: there were to be vi&s;ible &s;igns of Repentance, as now are required among us.</P>
<P N="2">2. In ca&s;e of ob&s;tinacy they had their way to purge the Church: they had their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures, according to di|vine In&s;titution. Which as Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> calls them, were an authoritative Exclu&s;ion of them, from the Society of the Church and the Members of it. The Jews do di&s;tin|gui&s;h the&s;e cen&s;ures into three degree, the fir&s;t they call <HI>Niddui,</HI> the &s;econd <HI>Cherem,</HI> the third <HI>Shammatha.</HI> The Jews in Chri&s;ts time did agree, that if any <HI>confe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;t, they would put him out of the Synagogue,</HI> Joh. 9.22. This was executed on the blind man,
<PB N="60" REF="001433_0066_0FB2F0C143FBE1D8"><HI>v</HI> 24. And it is very probable that when it is &s;aid in the Old Te&s;tament, that ob|&s;tinate offenders &s;hall be cut off from a|mong their People, that this is at lea&s;t &s;ometimes intended by it.</P>
<P N="3">3. When Per&s;ons were under the &s;econd cen&s;ure, which they call <HI>Cherem,</HI> they were not to eat the Pa&s;sover, they did allow them that were under the fir&s;t to come in|to the Temple, though at a di&s;tinct gate, which they called the gate of Mour|ners, but in the &s;econd they were exclu|ded: they agreed in Ezra's time, <HI>That tho&s;e that did not a&s;&s;emble within three days, &s;hould be &s;eparated from the Congregation,</HI> Ezra 10.8. Then they were looked on as Heathens, according to that, Math. 18.17. <HI>If he neg|lect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a Publican:</HI> which was no new rule appropriated to the Go&s;pel Church, which was not in being, when Chri&s;t &s;pake the&s;e words, but Chri&s;t did herein revive an old rule that had been always in force.</P>
<P N="2">2. Argument. <HI>If no Un&s;anctifyed Per&s;on may come to the Lords Supper, than no man may come, but be that knows him&s;elf to be Sanctifyed: But per&s;ons may come, that do not know them&s;elves to be Sanctifyed.</HI></P>

Thus the Apo&s;tle determines the ca&s;e about eating of fle&s;h: that tho&s;e that doubted whether God allowed them to do it and yet did it, were guilty: Rom. 14.23. <HI>He that doubteth is damned if he eat: be|cau&s;e he eateth not of faith, for what&s;oever is not of faith is &s;in.</HI> He that doth not know that he is Sanctifyed, doth not by that doctrine know that he hath any right to come: he is ignorant that he hath any warrant to come: if he comes, he comes upon his peril of eating and drinking damnation to him&s;elf: if he comes he takes a liberty to do that, that he doth not know, that God gives him a liberty to do: it is horrible pre&s;umption for him to come; if all un|&s;anctifyed per&s;ons are forbidden, then he doth not know but that it is forbidden
<PB N="62" REF="001433_0068_0FB2F0CF4F064C58">fruit to him, and that he rebels in coming: he that doth that, which he doth not know he may lawfully do, will not be ac|cepted in it: Con&s;cience may &s;ay to him, What right have you to it, Who gave you leave, What Warrant have you to do it? If Churches are to cen&s;ure only Scanda|lous per&s;ons, then they mu&s;t know they are Scandalous before they do cen&s;ure them; it is not enough for them to &s;ay they don't know but that they are, or they think that they are. If a man has a liberty to Sell only his own Hor&s;e, and not another mans, then he mu&s;t know it to be his own and not another mans; and it is not enough for him to &s;ay, He did not know but it was his own, or he thought it was his own. If a Mini&s;ter has a liber|ty to Preach nothing but the truth, then he mu&s;t know it to be the truth before he Preaches it; it is not enough for him to &s;ay, he did not know but it was, or that he hoped it was. Thus it is in this ca&s;e. If only Sanctification gives him a real right to the Lords Supper, then nothing &s;hort of the knowledge of Sanctification can give him a known right to it: until he knows his Sanctification he is ignorant of his right: if Sanctification only gives him a
<PB N="63" REF="001433_0069_0FB2F0D3173928F0">right, then if he doth not know his San|ctification, he doth not know, that he hath a right. Probable hopes wont Warrant him to come: for they don't give him a right, it is only Sanctification doth that, neither do they evidence that he hath a right.</P>
<P>But though the truth of this Argument be as evident as the light of the Sun at Noon day, yet it would be &s;trange if Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> &s;hould have no an&s;wer to give. <HI>He tells us if after &s;erious Examination, be can|not but hope there is a good work begun in his Soul, be ought to come, though his hopes be not A&s;&s;urance.</HI></P>
<P>But I &s;ay, he ought not to come unle&s;s he has a right to come; ought he to come if he have this hope, whether he be Re|generate or not? he may have the&s;e hopes, and yet be un&s;anctifyed, then it is not San|ctification that gives him the right but the hopes of it: he ought to come, Mr. <HI>M.</HI> &s;aith: yet he ought to &s;tay away becau&s;e he is un&s;anctifyed: he is charged to come becau&s;e of his hopes, and condemned for coming becau&s;e he is un&s;anctifyed.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> labours to give relief to Wounded Con&s;ciences by a compari&s;on, he tells, <HI>If a Jew after he had &s;earched for
<PB N="64" REF="001433_0070_0FB2F0D4057AC560">leaven in the hou&s;e, found none, be was to eat the Pa&s;sover; &s;o if Chri&s;tians after &s;elf Exa|mination, cannot find that they are in a &s;tate of Hypocri&s;y, which is leaven, they ought to come to the Lords Table.</HI> Here is a &s;hadow with|out &s;ub&s;tance, a compari&s;on without a &s;imilitude. The Jew &s;earches for leaven, he finds bread and is at a lo&s;s whether it be leavened or no; may he eat the Pa&s;so|ver without removing that bread; &s;o the Chri&s;tian &s;earches his heart, and finds a great deal of hypocri&s;y, but is at a lo&s;s whether it be reigning hypocri&s;y or no: ought he in this ca&s;e to run the venture and come to the Lords Table?</P>
<P>The ca&s;e with the&s;e men that don't know their Saint-&s;hip, is like the ca&s;e of the Prie&s;ts that could not find their Re|gi&s;ter, Ezra 2.62, 63. <HI>They were put from the Prie&s;t-bood as Polluted, that they &s;hould not eat of the holy things, till there &s;tood up a Prie&s;t with Urim and Thummim.</HI> So the&s;e that cannot find their Saint-&s;hip mu&s;t forbear eating at the Lords Table, till they can make it out, if it be Sanctification that gives a right to the Lords Supper.</P>
<P>There is a &s;trange incon&s;i&s;tency in his doctrine, &s;ometimes he teaches that Re|generation gives the right to come, and
<PB N="65" REF="001433_0071_0FB2F0D6DD96C0B8">that un&s;anctifyed per&s;ons may not come; &s;ometimes that if they hope after Exami|nation that they are godly, then they may come. But if it be grace only that gives them a right, then preponderating hopes of Grace will not give them a right; be|&s;ides if an hope that they are godly gives them a right, then that which is very &s;in|ful will give them a right: for &s;uch are the hopes of many men, founded in Pride and Ignorance: <HI>There is a Generation that are pure in their own eyes, yet are not clean&s;ed from their filthine&s;s,</HI> Prov. 30.12. Again, if a probable hope gives men a right, then when ever they have a preponderating fear that they are not godly, they mu&s;t forbear, and &s;o neglect the means of their con&s;olation. Again, if a preponderating hope gives them a right: then &s;ome have a right to the Lords Supper, that are wor&s;e than &s;ome that know them&s;elves to be Unconverted: &s;ome conceited &s;encele&s;s men nouri&s;h &s;uch an hope: and &s;ome that are very near to the Kingdom of God, be|ing humbled and prepared for Chri&s;t know them&s;elves to the Unconverted.</P>
<P N="3">3. Argument. <HI>Tho&s;e that are Members of the Church and neither ignorant nor &s;candalous may lawfully come to the Lords Supper, but &s;ome
<PB N="66" REF="001433_0072_0FB2F0D80EF90200">Un&s;anctifred per&s;ons are Members of the Church and neither ignorant nor &s;candalous.</HI></P>
<P>The major doth appear, from the in|&s;titution of Chri&s;t, this is his command to his Church. When Chri&s;t in&s;tituted the Supper, he appointed it to be an Ordi|nance for Di&s;ciples to the end of the World, when he &s;aid, <HI>This do in remembrance of me,</HI> Luk. 22.19. It doth not only in|tend the duty of the Apo&s;tles at that time, but that they and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ours &s;hould attend that Service in all Generations. Therefore this command is inforced on the Church of Corinth by the Apo&s;tle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.24, 25. This is one &s;pecial way wherein the Church doth give a te&s;timony unto Chri&s;t, celebrate the Memory of his death, and &s;hew it forth: <HI>As often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye &s;hew forth the Lords death till he come.</HI></P>
<P>This is al&s;o evident from the practice of the Apo&s;tles, and primitive Church, tho&s;e that were added to the Church continu|ed in this practice. <HI>Acts</HI> 2.42. So the <HI>Di&s;ciples came together on the Lords day to break bread,</HI> Acts 20.7. This was the man|ner al&s;o of the Church of Corinth: there were not a Number of them that neglected, becau&s;e un&s;anctifyed, but they all partook.
<PB N="67" REF="001433_0073_0FB2F0DCB3CFA048">1 Cor. 10 17. <HI>We being many are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread:</HI> 1 Cor. 12.13. <HI>For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>The minor is al&s;o evident. That &s;ome Un&s;anctifyed men are Members of the Church. The fooli&s;h Virgins did belong unto the Kingdom of God, as well as the wi&s;e, Mat. 25.1, 2. <HI>The Kingdom of heaven &s;hall be likened to ten Virgins which took their Lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom, and five of them were wi&s;e, and five were fool|i&s;h.</HI> Multitudes that are in fellow&s;hip with Churches are de&s;titute of Saving Grace. Among the many that are called &s;ew are cho&s;en, <HI>Math.</HI> 20.16. Our Reve|rend Author does acknowledge this, but he faith, <HI>They are not duly qualifyed to be Members of Churches.</HI> But this is utterly in|con&s;i&s;tent with what he faith in other pla|ces. For he doth again &amp; again acknow|ledge that the Churches ought to admit tho&s;e that are Saints to rational Charity, though they be Unregenerate; and like|wi&s;e he doth acknowledge, that if after <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Examination, a per&s;on cannot but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that there is a good Work begun in
<PB N="68" REF="001433_0074_0FB2F0DDA94B2EA8">his Soul, he ought to come. And by the&s;e two rules many that are de&s;titute of Grace ought to be admitted into Churches, God does appoint them to come and God does appoint Churches to accept of them; &s;o that according to divine in&s;titution they are Members of Churches, and qualifyed according to Gods Ordinance for it.</P>
<P>For the further clearing that &s;ome Un|&s;anctifyed per&s;ons are Members of the Church. Let it be con&s;idered, that many of the&s;e per&s;ons were born in the Church, and therefore Baptized in their Infancy, and have been all their days bred up in the Church, and never gave any ju&s;t occa&s;i|on to be ca&s;t out of the Church: &s;o that they have their &s;tanding there, and are regular Members of the Church.</P>
<P>I fore&s;ee that Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> will object a|gain&s;t this, from his digre&s;&s;ion, <HI>p.</HI> 20, 21. <HI>viz.</HI> That the&s;e per&s;ons do belong to the vi&s;i|ble Catholick, but not to any particular in&s;tituted Church, and he has Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> for his voucher.</P>
<P>But this will not bear Examination; it is as if he &s;hould &s;ay, That the Children of the Town, were Members of Mankind, and Members of the Common Wealth, but not Members of the Town where they
<PB N="69" REF="001433_0075_0FB2F0E008DFA6F8">dwell: Is it agreable to rea&s;on to think that the Church &s;tands in relation to them, and is bound to &s;ee to their Education, and that they &s;tand in no relation to the Church? How unrea&s;onable is it to think, that a Multitude of men &s;hould be reckoned of the Common Wealth of I&s;ra|el, and have &s;ome Priviledges for them|&s;elves and Children, and yet be under no Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government? is not this quite contrary to the practice of the&s;e Churches, who have been wont to call many to account for their Mi&s;demenours, who were the Children of the Church?</P>
<P>What do the&s;e men want to make them Members of particular Churches? he will &s;ay, <HI>They want to be in Covenant with parti|cular Churches;</HI> but there is neither Pre|cept nor PRecedent for it in the Scripture. He faith in another Book, That I call the Church a body corporate; but there is no forming of a body corporate without a Covenant; but therein he lies under a great mi&s;take; bodies corporate may be made by Law, and they may be made by Charter.</P>
<P>There is a covenant indeed between God and every profe&s;&s;ing Nation. God brought his people of old into a Church
<PB N="70" REF="001433_0076_0FB2F0E16E26E548">E&s;tate by making a covenant with them, which covenant was &s;everal times renew|ed, <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.10-13. And all Pro&s;elytes a|mong the Jews were to take hold of this covenant: <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 56.4. But there is no nece&s;&s;ity of any covenant between the Members of a particular Congregation among them&s;elves, though God makes Promi&s;es to a National Church, it does not follow, that the Members of a Congre|gation mu&s;t make Promi&s;es among them|&s;elves. There was a covenant between God and the Church of I&s;rael: but the Members of each Synagogue did not make a covenant between them&s;elves: Parti|cular Churches may be bounded either by civil Authority, or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, or by Argument: and it is ordinarily the duty of every one that is a Member of the Ca|tholick Church, to carry on the Wor&s;hip of God in conjunction with the particular Church where he dwells: and he is bound by his profe&s;&s;ion of Religion &s;o to do, and the Church likewi&s;e doth &s;tand bound to accept of him, if he carries well.</P>
<P N="4">4. Argument <HI>If the Lords Supper be in|&s;tituted for Conver&s;ion of Sinners as well as for the Edification of Saints, then Sanctifying Grace is not nece&s;&s;ary to mens attending of it: But it as In&s;tituted for the Conver&s;ion of Sinners: not
<PB N="71" REF="001433_0077_0FB2F0E354F985A8">for the Conver&s;ion of Heathens to the Chri&s;tian Religion, but for the Saving Conver&s;ion of Profe&s;&s;ing men.</HI></P>
<P>The minor which is only in que&s;tion, may be confirmed by the&s;e con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. This Ordinance has a proper ten|dency to promote mens Conver&s;ion. Con|ver&s;ion taken largly, as it comprehends preparatory Work, con&s;i&s;ts of three parts, &amp; this Ordinance is &s;erviceable to them all.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Conviction.</HI> Men mu&s;t be convinced of the anger of God becau&s;e of their Sins, and the nece&s;&s;ity of being at Peace with him: and this Ordinance is a means to &s;ettle this conviction on the heart: for here is a di&s;covery of the terrible anger of God for &s;in, by the inflicting of the cur&s;e upon Chri&s;t, when &s;in was but imputed unto him; a man may well rea&s;on thus, <HI>If this be done to the green tree, what &s;hall be done to the dry?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Humiliation.</HI> Or the bringing of the Sinner off from his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s: for in this Ordinance God teaches men, the nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;ts righteou&s;ne&s;s, that their own is but husks, and will not nou|ri&s;h them up unto eternal Life.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Faith.</HI> Chri&s;t is here offered to men, and the call makes way for the an&s;wer of
<PB N="72" REF="001433_0078_0FB2F0E707BC4920">the Soul; here is an affecting repre&s;en|tation of the dying love of Chri&s;t, which &s;erves to remove many di&s;couragements, and of the accur&s;ed death of Chri&s;t, where|in the Sinner may &s;ee Satisfaction made for &s;in. In this Ordinance the truth of the covenant is Sealed, which is a great means to beget in the Soul a per&s;wa&s;ion of the cruth of it. And if the man be but convinced of the&s;e things he is gained: tho&s;e that under&s;tand any thing of the working of Gods Spirit on the heart, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that it hath a great tendency to advance Conver&s;ion; &amp; why has God given it &s;uch a tendency to promote Conver&s;ion, if it were not appointed for that end.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some that are Un&s;anctifyed ought to offer them&s;elves to communion in the Lords Supper, and that on a double account; <HI>1&s;t.</HI> Becau&s;e they are in cove|nant with God, and therefore being nei|ther ignorant nor of bad conver&s;ation, the Seal of the covenant doth belong to them. Many of them were born in covenant and have actually renewed the covenant, and therefore ought to tender them&s;elves to communion, they ought to receive Gods confirmation of his covenant, and to u&s;e
<PB N="73" REF="001433_0079_0FB2F0E9C934DF60">the means to &s;tir them up to keep cove|nant. <HI>2ly.</HI> Becau&s;e it is a &s;candal if they do not, and the Church may call them to an account for their neglect. It is a vi&s;ible contempt ca&s;t upon the Ordinance, it is a denyal of the Go&s;pel, and a refu&s;al to &s;hew forth the death of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Church by the Ordinance of God is bound to admit many Unconverted per&s;ons to the Lords-Supper, they are Eccle&s;ia&s;tically qualifyed having know|ledge and a good conver&s;ation; they are Saints to a judgment of Charity, walking orderly; and therefore the Church is to accept them into their communion; the Church is to act upon what is vi&s;ible, &s;o that according to the Ordinance of God they are to be received to communion.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Lords Supper is for the Spiritual good of all that are regularly to be admit|ted thereunto. All Ordinances attended according to in&s;titution, are for that end, that the Spirit may be Saved in the day of the Lord Je&s;us, and &s;o this Ordinance. This is the Work of the Mini&s;try in all their admini&s;trations, by all means to &s;ave &s;ome. This Ordinance may have a contrary ef|fect, &amp; be an occa&s;ion of the ruin of &s;oftie: but the direct end of it is Salvation, and
<PB N="74" REF="001433_0080_0FB2F0ED52801D50">&s;o the direct end of it is Conver&s;ion, when the Subject that it is admini&s;tred unto &s;tands in need of Conver&s;ion: there is no rea&s;on to confine the benefit of it unto Saints.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> argues, That <HI>Faith comes by Hearing,</HI> Rom. 14. Why does he not argue that the Sub&s;equent acts of faith come by hearing as well as the fir&s;t, and that there|fore the Lords Supper is not for the &s;trengthning of Faith. Put indeed there is Hearing, as well as Seeing, and Touch|ing and Smelling and Ta&s;ting, in the Sa|crament of the Supper, there is a gracious offer of Chri&s;t, and all his benefits, which has a proper tendency to beget faith.</P>
<P N="5">5. Argument. <HI>If the Lords Supper be only for Converted men, then God would have given &s;ome certain rule in the attending of which it might be re&s;trained to Converted men: but he hath given no &s;uch rule in attending of which it may be re&s;trained to Converted men.</HI></P>
<P>The major is evident, becau&s;e if it be appointed only for Converted men, and no rule given whereby it may be re&s;train|ed to them, then his Law would be im|practicable. The law would be a meer &s;nare, and men would be under a nece&s;&s;i|ty to prophane his Ordinance: it is a re|flection
<PB N="75" REF="001433_0081_0FB2F0EFA6C1DC18">on the Wi&s;dom and Holine&s;s of God to impute &s;uch a thing to him. God don't bind his Church to impo&s;&s;ibilities, if he had made any &s;uch Ordinance, he would give gifts to his Church to di&s;tingui&s;h Sincere men from Hypocrites, whereby the Ordinance might have been attended.</P>
<P>The minor is al&s;o evident: He has given no &s;uch rule to his Church, where|by it may be re&s;trained to converted Men. This appears becau&s;e by the rule, that they are to go by, they are allowed to give the Lords Supper to many Unconverted men: for all vi&s;ible Signs are common to men converted and unconverted. If they go by profe&s;&s;ion of the truth, that is com|mon to both; if by a good Conver&s;ation, that is common to both; if by zeal in Re|ligion, that is common to both; if by &s;uf|fering in the cau&s;e of God, that is common to both; if by knowledge, that is common to both; if by a relation of Experiences, that is common to both.</P>
<P>Obj <HI>There is a certain rule given whereby godly men may knew their godline&s;s, &amp; that they are Warranted to come to the Lords Supper.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> will not &s;tand by that rule: for he &s;aith, <HI>That if after &s;erious &s;elf Examination, a man cannot but hope that
<PB N="76" REF="001433_0082_0FB2F0F150230EC8">he is a godly man, he may come though be hath not A&s;&s;urance:</HI> And if he goes by Mr. <HI>Ma|ther's</HI> rule, that will not re&s;train the Sa|crament to converted men. Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> pretends to give a &s;olution of this argu|ment, by propounding another Objection for me to an&s;wer. He &s;aith, <HI>That I main|tain that only Orthodox Chri&s;tians may come to the Lords Supper;</HI> and then there mu&s;t be a certain rule to know the inward Sen|timents of mens hearts: but he mi&s;takes the matter very much; I only hold that men mu&s;t be Orthodox in their Profe&s;&s;ion. Churches are to judge concerning vi&s;ible Saint-&s;hip, when they go higher they go beyond their Sphere.</P>
<P>He &s;aith, <HI>why &s;hould we not believe that men that give us an account of their Con|ver&s;ion, and who&s;e Conver&s;ations are outwardly blamele&s;s and holy, are really according as they &s;eem to be.</HI> I will give him a rea&s;on, and that is becau&s;e it may be fal&s;e; Ma|ny per&s;ons that have given a fair account and carried well in the eye of the World for &s;everal years, have not proved well at la&s;t: and God obliges no man to believe that which may be fal&s;e.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="77" REF="001433_0083_0FB2F0F2B4E74238">
6. Argument. <HI>If Un&s;anctifyed men may attend all other Ordinances or Duties of Wor|&s;hip, then they may lawfully attend the Lords Supper: But they may attend all other Ordi|nances or Duties of Wor&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>The minor will be generally acknow|ledged: And indeed there was not any duty of Wor&s;hip required &s;ince the foun|dation of the World, that they might not attend. But Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> doth object: he grants that an Unconverted man may Preach: for he may have great gifts which he may and ought to improve to the glory of God, and the good of men. But he thinks he may not admini&s;ter the Lords Supper; he &s;aith, <HI>The argument from Natural to In&s;tituted Wor&s;hip will not hold.</HI> But he &s;trangly forgets him&s;elf; might not the Prie&s;ts of old though unregenerate attend other duties of their Office as well as Preach the word; Sacrificing was In|&s;tituted Wor&s;hip as well as admini&s;tring the Lords Supper, &s;o was offering of In|cen&s;e: but where were they forbidden to do tho&s;e Services, in ca&s;e they were Unrege|nerate? the ble&s;&s;ing of admini&s;trations in the hou&s;e of God doth not depend upon the Piety of the Mini&s;ter. The Officia|ting
<PB N="78" REF="001433_0084_0FB2F0F491C2E000">as Prie&s;ts of old did depend upon Na|tural Generation, and not upon Regene|ration: Unregeneracy did not give them a di&s;charge from the work of their Office.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence may be made evi|dent from hence, becau&s;e there can be no rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned, why Un&s;anctifyed per&s;ons may attend all other duties of Wor&s;hip and not the Lords Supper. If there be the like rea&s;on for them to for|bear other duties of Wor&s;hip as to forbear this, and the like rea&s;on to attend this act of Wor&s;hip as others, then the lawful|ne&s;s of attending them, &s;hews the lawful|ne&s;s of attending this: if it were made out to be Gods plea&s;ure that it &s;hould be &s;o that is rea&s;on enough: but there is no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for &s;uch a di&s;|ference.</P>
<P>Particularly: It can be no rea&s;on for Unregenerate men to forbear the Lords Supper becau&s;e it is an holy Ordinance: For all the Ordinances of God are holy. Circumci&s;ion was &s;o, and the Pa&s;sover, &s;o is Bapti&s;m: the&s;e Ordinances were ap|pointed for the advancing of Holine&s;s, there was Religion in them, they were to be attended in an holy manner, and it was great Wickedne&s;s to u&s;e them in a

<P N="2">2. The Lords Supper being a Sacra|ment or Seal of the Covenant can be no rea&s;on. Two of Mr. <HI>Gille&s;py</HI>'s arguments are built upon that foundation; but if that arguing were good, Unregenerate per&s;ons mu&s;t be forbidden all Sacraments. <HI>Circumci&s;ion was a Seal of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith, Rom.</HI> 4.11.

<P N="3">3. Its being a Sacrament of confirma|tion can be no &s;ufficient rea&s;on. For the Pa&s;sover was &s;o as well as the Lords Sup|per; Circumci&s;ion was the initiating Sa|crament to the Jews, and the Pa&s;sover the Sacrament of confirmation: but Unrege|nerate men might lawfully celebrate the Pa&s;sover, when God fir&s;t appointed it, multitudes of them were Unregenerate, as appears by their carriage in the Wilder|ne&s;s. As this Sacrament does repre&s;ent
<PB N="80" REF="001433_0086_0FB2F0FA278BCF50">Chri&s;t as food for the Soul, &s;o did the Pa&s;s|over: As in this Ordinance, Saints have communion with Chri&s;t, &s;o they had in the Pa&s;sover.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It is no &s;ufficient rea&s;on,</HI> becau&s;e the Mini&s;ter is to &s;ay at the admini&s;tration of the Lords Supper, That <HI>this is Chri&s;ts body which is given for you,</HI> and <HI>this is his blood which is &s;hed for you:</HI> according to the Pattern: <HI>Luke</HI> 22.19,20. For the&s;e words may be &s;poken to Unregenerate men. As Mini&s;ters often do in their Sermons, when they call on Sinners to come to Chri&s;t, and when they reprove for &s;in, and urge them to duties of Obedience: tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions do not intend that Chri&s;t did dye de&s;ignedly for them, but that his death and &s;atisfaction is offered to them, and &s;hall be made over to them if they accept of Him.</P>
<P N="5">5. Gods not allowing Scandalous per|&s;ons to come to this Ordinance is no rea|&s;on. Some Scandalous per&s;ons indeed may be far better than Unregenerate per|&s;ons, yet there may be great rea&s;on for the former to be prohibited and not the latter: Scandalous per&s;ons are forbidden, partly to bring them in that way to a &s;ight of their evil practices, partly for the

<P N="6">6. The Apo&s;tles commanding men to Examine them&s;elves as a preparation for coming to the Lords Supper, can be no rea|&s;on. If he had &s;aid, Let men Examine them|&s;elves &amp; &s;o let them fa&s;t, we &s;hould not have thought that to be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for Unregenerate men to ab&s;tain from fa&s;t|ing. And if he had &s;aid, That he that Prays unworthily, and Hears the word un|worthily, expo&s;es him&s;elf to Damnation or Judgment, we &s;hould not have looked upon that a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for Unrege|nerate men to refrain from Praying, and Hearing of the Word.</P>
<P>Were I a Papi&s;t, and did I believe the doctrine of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, that the Bread and Wine were the natural body and blood of Chri&s;t, I might think that to be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for Unregenerate mens not coming to the Lords Supper, &amp; though I do not imagine any &s;uch ap|prehen&s;ions in tho&s;e Brethren that differ from me, yet I doubt that opinion has laid the foundation of their doctrine, and likewi&s;e of recieving the Sacrament knee|ling.</P>

7. Argument. <HI>They that are in external Covenant with God, and neither Ignerant nor Scandalous may lawfully come to the Lords Supper, but &s;ome Un&s;anctifyed per&s;ons are in external Covenant with God.</HI></P>
<P>The minor cannot be denyed. God made a Covenant with the whole People of I&s;rael: <HI>Deut.</HI> 5.2. They and their Po&s;terity after them were the Covenant People of God: God &s;tood in relation to them as their God, they &s;tood in relation to him as his People. And &s;o the Profe&s;|&s;ing People of God now are in Covenant with him, and &s;o are their Children, and therefore they are baptized.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence is evident from hence. Becau&s;e it is lawful for them to keep the external Covenant: as they have a natu|ral &s;o they have a legal power to keep the external Covenant. The attending of the Lords Supper is one of the external duties of the Covenant: Circumci&s;ion is &s;aid <HI>to be the Covenant:</HI> Gen. 17.10. <HI>This is my Covenant which ye &s;hall keep between me and you, and thy Seed after thee, every man Child among you, &s;hall be circumci&s;ed.</HI> And <HI>v.</HI> 14. The neglect of this is called, <HI>A break|ing of the Covenant.</HI> So the Lords Supper
<PB N="83" REF="001433_0089_0FB2F101AF55FB20">is part of the Covenant, and a token of the Covenant: and if any Profe&s;&s;ing People do neglect it, be it under what notion it will, it will be a grievous breach of Covenant.</P>
<P>If God does command them to attend Covenant duties, then he don't forbid them; God does not require and prohi|bit the &s;ame thing, there is a con&s;i&s;tency in Gods commands: He does not lay a tye upon mens Con&s;ciences to come, and lay a tye upon their Con&s;ciences to for|bear; God makes them promi&s;e to keep his Covenant; and will he make it criminal to attend tho&s;e duties of the Covenant, which he has made them promi&s;e to keep? they cannot keep the Covenant if they don't come to the Lords Supper, therefore it mu&s;t be lawful for them to come.</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>It is a Covenant duty but it mu&s;t not be attended by Unqualifyed Per&s;ons; though it be a Covenant duty, yet not for Ignorant Per|&s;ons, nor Scandalous Per&s;ons, nor Un&s;anctifyed Per&s;ons: if Per&s;ons be not duly qualified it is no immediate duty for them; the Ignorant mu&s;t get knowledge, Scandalous per&s;ons mu&s;t repent of their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and Natural men mu&s;t get into a Converted condition, and &s;o come to the Lords Supper.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="001433_0090_0FB2F1033683E308">
<HI>An&s;w.</HI> It is very rea&s;onable to &s;ay that God requires Ignorant per&s;ons to come, and yet for bids them to come before they have knowledge; and that he requires Scandalous per&s;ons to come, and yet for|bids their coming until they have made Satisfaction: becau&s;e they are able to qualify them&s;elves, they may truly be &s;aid to have liberty and legal power to come, becau&s;e they have a natural power to qualify them&s;elves; it is their duty to amend their fauls and &s;o to come.</P>
<P>But it is unrea&s;onable to &s;ay that natu|ral men are commanded to come, and yet that they are forbidden to come till they are Sanctifyed: for their Sanctifica|tion is a thing out of their power: the vi|&s;ible people of God are able to keep the external Covenant: It cannot be &s;aid to be lawful for them to keep the external Covenant, if it doth depend upon their Conver&s;ion which is indeed out of their power. But indeed there is no part of the external Covenant, that is beyond mens natural power, or their legal power.</P>
<P N="8">8. Argument. <HI>Either &s;ome Un&s;anctifyed Per&s;ons may lawfully come to the Lords Supper, or it is not lawful for them to carry them&s;elves
<PB N="85" REF="001433_0091_0FB2F105A52BEE20">as Saints: But it is not unlawful for them to carry them&s;elves as Soints.</HI></P>
<P>The minor doth appear: Becau&s;e Pro|fe&s;&s;ors are commanded to carry as be|cometh Saints: Phil. 1.27. <HI>Let your con|ver&s;ation be as becometh the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI> 2 Tim. 2.19. <HI>Let every one that nameth the name of Chri&s;t depart from iniquity.</HI> Such as make a Profe&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel, ought not to carry &s;o as to give men occa&s;ion to &s;ear that they are not Saints: they may not live in &s;uch a way as is unlawful for Saints to live in, in &s;uch a way as is contra|ry to the Spirits of Saints: it is unlawful for them to bring a reproach upon their Profe&s;&s;ion; to live in &s;uch a way as is in|con&s;i&s;tent with the living exerci&s;e of Grace.</P>
<P>The truth of the disjunction doth ap|pear; becau&s;e when Profe&s;&s;ors do neg|lect the Lords Supper, they do not carry them&s;elves as Saints; for they do neglect that Ordinance that Saints are bound to attend; and they neglect that Ordinance that the Souls of Saints do crave, they do vi&s;ibly deny the Go&s;pel, they withold their Te&s;timony from Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and do not &s;hew forth the Lords death. This neglect of theirs is an unholy carriage, not
<PB N="86" REF="001433_0092_0FB2F106F4E04528">according to their Profe&s;&s;ion; they carry like vi&s;ible Unbelievers they are called vi&s;ible Saints &amp; challenge Bapti&s;m for their Children as vi&s;ible Saints, and yet in this particular they carry them&s;elves as Unbe|lieves, and not as vi&s;ible Saints.</P>
<P N="9">9. Argument. <HI>If Sanctifying Grace be nece&s;&s;ary unto the lawful attending of the Lords Supper, then none but tho&s;e that have a Saving work of Conver&s;ion, may attend it: but that is not true doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>The minor is evident from hence: That doctrine that has a direct tendency to di&s;courage many godly Men from doing their duty, and the means of their com|fort, and to make their attending of their duty to be a torment to them, is not ac|cording to the Scripture. For one great de&s;ign in the Scripture is to encourage godly men to do their duty: but this doctrine has quite another tendency.</P>
<P>There be many godly men, that are not a&s;&s;ured of their Conver&s;ion: but are exerci&s;ed with many fears about their Sincerity: though Grace be vi&s;ible, yet &s;everal Per&s;ons that have it do not cer|tainly know it. Grace may be &s;o coun|terfeited, and fal&s;e hearts may go &s;o far
<PB N="87" REF="001433_0093_0FB2F10AA08BF478">in Religion, that many godly men are held down with great Su&s;picions that they are not godly, e&s;pecially at times. Hence godly men are advi&s;ed <HI>to give all diligence to make their Calling &amp; Election &s;ure,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.10. And this doctrine has two bad effects upon them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It makes them neglect the Lords Supper.</HI> It is their duty to attend it: it is one of the holy appointments of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and we owe this Service to Chri&s;t to &s;hew forth his Death, and give our te&s;ti|mony before the world, to the vertue of his blood, which is an honour and glory to him; and this Service is of great con|&s;equence to our &s;elves to draw forth the actings of faith, to &s;trengthen our com|fort and to quicken us in a way of Obe|dience: but &s;everal as choice Per&s;ons for godline&s;s as any, &s;o far as men can judge, have been &s;o di&s;couraged by this doctrine, that they have neglected the Lords Sup|per; and continued at lea&s;t for &s;ome time in the Omi&s;&s;ion of this Ordinance.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It makes &s;ome of them to attend it with guilt and torment.</HI> They have been urged to attend it by a fear lea&s;t they &s;hould of|fend God, and by the per&s;wa&s;ions of men, and by con&s;idering that it would be an
<PB N="88" REF="001433_0094_0FB2F10B67FBBF90">occa&s;ion of reproach: and an offence to the Church, if they &s;hould not do it. Yet becau&s;e of this doctrine, they have been far from Satisfaction in what they have been doing: Con&s;cience has forbid|den them, threatned them and condemn|ed them for doing of it; they have &s;et upon thorns, and had a great deal of fear and di&s;quietment of Spirit: hereby they have been hindred from attending of it in an holy manner; Con&s;cience has for|bidden them to meddle with it, their thoughts has been taken up at the time, not about the virtue of Chri&s;ts Death, but about their own dreadful venture in com|ing thither: the fears of their hypocri&s;y have been increa&s;ed by their daring to participate; that that &s;hould have been a means to comfort them, has proved an occa&s;ion of torment to them.</P>
<P>If the&s;e per&s;ons be told that this Ordi|nance be only for Converted per&s;ons, yet if they after Serious Examination have hopes that they are Converted, they may and ought to come; That will not &s;atis|fy their tender Con&s;ciences: they will &s;ay, <HI>We may have &s;uch hopes and yet not be Converted: the hopes of Multitudes of men are delu&s;ions, and if our hopes &s;hould be &s;uch,</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="001433_0095_0FB2F113E5C76EB8"><HI>they will not warrant us to come, we don't find in the Scriptures, that God gives allow|ance to men becau&s;e they have hopes; we can't find that God &s;aith we &s;hould come, if we have &s;uch hopes:</HI> the men &s;ay: <HI>We don't know but that we eat and drink Damnation to our &s;elves: the thing that is required is Conver&s;ion, not hopes of Conver&s;ion. If God &s;hould demand of us, What makes us &s;o bold to come, He will not accept of that for an an&s;wer, That we hoped we were Converted, if we be not indeed &s;o, we prophane Gods Or|dinance, and eat forbidden fruit.</HI> Fears that they are not Converted is a &s;tronger ar|gument to make them &s;tay away, than hopes that they are Converted is to make them come: Tender Con&s;ciences will not be bafled with &s;uch an&s;wers.</P>
<P N="10">10. Argument. <HI>They who do convey to their Children a right to the Sacrament of Bapti&s;m, have a right them&s;elves to the Lords Supper, provided they carry inoffen&s;ively: But &s;ome Un&s;anctifyed per&s;ons do convey unto their Children a right to the Sacrament of Bapti&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>The minor is evident from the&s;e two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Children of &s;ome Un&s;anctifyed
<PB N="90" REF="001433_0096_0FB2F115FA769550">per&s;ons have a right to Bapti&s;m.</HI> For the Children of all vi&s;ible Believers have a right to Bapti&s;m, and among them, there be &s;everal Un&s;anctifyed Per&s;ons: and it has been determined by a <HI>Synod</HI> in <HI>New|England, That the Children of tho&s;e who are born in the Church, and under&s;tand the Prin|ciples of Religion, and own the Covenant, are to be Baptized.</HI> And the generality of the Churches in <HI>New-England</HI> do prac|tice accordingly.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That the Parents though Un&s;anctifyed, do convey this right unto their Children.</HI> The Children have a right to Bapti&s;m, becau&s;e they are the Children of vi&s;ible Believers: the Children are Eccle&s;ia&s;tically holy be|cau&s;e one at lea&s;t of their Parents are vi|&s;ible Believers: 1 Cor. 7.14. <HI>The unbe|lieving Husband is Sanctifyed by the Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is Sanctifyed by the Hus|band, el&s;e were your Children unclean, but now are they holy.</HI></P>
<P>The con&s;equence is evident, becau&s;e this &s;hews that they are in Covanant with God. If they were not in Covenant with God, their Children would not be in Covenant, neither would they have any right to Bapti&s;m; but they are in Covenant, God has made Promi&s;es to
<PB N="91" REF="001433_0097_0FB2F11854EE0840">them, and they are under Covenant in|gagements to him; and becau&s;e they are in Covenant, and inoffen&s;ive in their Conver&s;ation, the Seal of the Covenant does belong to them.</P>
<P N="11">11. Argument. <HI>If the Invi&s;ible Church Catholick is not the prime and principal Sub|ject of the Seal of the Covenant, then &s;ome Un&s;anctifyed per&s;ons may lawfully partake of the Lords-Supper: But the Invi&s;ible Church Catholick is not the prime and principal Subject, of the Seals of the Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>The minor is laid down as a conclu&s;i|on by Mr. <HI>Thomas Hooker,</HI> in his Survey: <HI>p.</HI> 41. which he proves by &s;everal argu|ments again&s;t Mr. <HI>Ruterford.</HI></P>
<P>Particularly he argues, Such as were gracele&s;s and without any intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and &s;o none of his invi&s;ible Mem|bers, have Gods command to injoyn, and his word to warrant them, to receive the Seals; as <HI>I&s;hmael, E&s;au,</HI> and all the Males were injoyned to be Circumci&s;ed. All the Families of the Jews were command|ed to eat the Pa&s;sover, many whereof were without all que&s;tion, not invi&s;ible and believing Members of Chri&s;t. He
<PB N="92" REF="001433_0098_0FB2F119CA95ABC8">adds, That the vi&s;ible Church is the Olive &s;poken of, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.17. The Seals are part of that fulne&s;s that appertains there|unto: and therefore the vi&s;ible Church is the prime &s;ubject of them. And he brings in Mr. <HI>Ruterford</HI> confe&s;&s;ing that if any after they are received, &s;hall be found Unregenerate, they are not to be ca&s;t out for that. And &s;aith upon it. Then I &s;uppo&s;e you will not deny them the Seals. <HI>p.</HI> 43.</P>
<P>I mention this Te&s;timony of Mr. <HI>Hook|ers,</HI> to &s;hew how injuriou&s;ly Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> deals with me, when he calls my Opinion, a new, up&s;tart and &s;ingular Opinion; and the vanity of his admiration, That a Mini&s;ter of <HI>New-England,</HI> &s;hould Publi&s;h &s;uch doctrine; whereas its no other than what has been Printed by one of the Pillars of the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> Sixty years before.</P>
<P>Had Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> &s;poken half &s;o much in the Vindication of Mr. <HI>Mather</HI>'s Opi|nion, in probability he would have &s;pent good part of a Page in an Encomium of him, and in urging the irrefragablene&s;s of his di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="001433_0099_0FB2F11CB5FBEA70">
Before I conclude, I &s;hall take notice of two failings further in Mr. <HI>Mather's</HI> Book; one is, That he recites &s;ome &s;en|tences of mine, where I Paraphra&s;e on and illu&s;trate my Po&s;ition about the Lords|Supper: as if they were the arguments that I brought to prove my Opinion; and then &s;aith, Is not all this weak ar|guing. <HI>p.</HI> 76. He has now my arguments, and his liberty to &s;hew the weakne&s;s of them.</P>
<P>The other is, That he &s;aith, My doctrine hath been condemned by an whole Synod of Elders and Me&s;&s;engers of Churches: who met in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in the year 1679.</P>
<P>The words of the Synod are the&s;e, <HI>It is requi&s;ite that Per&s;ons be not admitted un|to Communion in the Lords Supper, without making a Per&s;onal and Publick Profe&s;&s;ion of their Faith and Repentance, either Orally or in &s;ome other way, to the ju&s;t Satisfaction of the Church, and that therefore both Elders and Churches be duely watchful and circum|&s;pect in this matter.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall give the World an Account how the matter was acted. Some of the Elders in the Synod had drawn up a Con|clu&s;ion,
<PB N="94" REF="001433_0100_0FB2FBD5074C0EA8">That per&s;ons &s;hould make a Re|lation of the work of Gods Spirit upon their hearts, in order to coming into full Communion. Some others of the Elders objected again&s;t it, and after &s;ome di&s;|cour&s;e it was agreed to have a di&s;pute on that que&s;tion, Whether tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion as are of good Conver&s;ation, are not to be admitted to full Communi|on, provided that they are able to Exa|mine them&s;elves, and di&s;cern the Lords body. Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> held the Negative; I laboured to make good the Affirmative: The re&s;ult was, That they blotted out that clau&s;e of Making a Relation of the work of Gods Spirit, and put in the room of it, <HI>The Making a Profe&s;&s;ion of their Faith and Repentance;</HI> and &s;o I Voted with the Re&s;t, and am of the &s;ame judgment &s;till; yet this Vote is mentioned as condem|ning my Opinion.</P>
<P>What can we &s;uppo&s;e to be the rea&s;on, that Divines in reckoning up tho&s;e bene|fits that flow from Effectual Calling, take no notice of a right to the Lords Supper, they reckon Ju&s;tification, Adoption, San|ctification, Peace of Con&s;cience, Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, A&s;&s;urance of Gods Love, &amp;c.
<PB N="95" REF="001433_0101_0FB2FBD676DF4D60">But I meet with none that reckon a right to the Lords-Supper among tho&s;e bene|fits: I can give no other rea&s;on than this, That it is not accounted of by them a peculiar Priviledge of tho&s;e that are Ef|fectually Called; but the Priviledge of vi&s;ible Believers: neither would Pa&s;tors of Churches &s;atisfy their Con&s;ciences, to forbear warning of &s;uch as were convin|ced that they were in a Natural E&s;tate, to refrain coming to the Lords Supper, if they did judge it to be a Sinful and Dan|gerous thing for them to come.</P>
<P>If the&s;e things which I have Written be impartially con&s;idered, it will appear that Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> has not proved any mi&s;take in the Sermon, that he has &s;hew|ed &s;o much zeal again&s;t; indeed Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> has in a manner given the ca&s;e. (1.) By owning that the Church ought to receive Unregenerate men, provided they are Godly to rational Charity. (2.) That it is the duty of per&s;ons to come to the Lords-Supper, if after Exa|mination they cannot but hope, that there is a good work begun in them.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="001433_0102_0FB2FBDA300A3F90">
I will conclude this defence, of my Self, and my Sermon again&s;t which Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> has Written, with my a&s;&s;urance of my Brethren in the Mini&s;try, and all good Men, That I differ from none of them in a &s;trict Opinion of the Straight|ne&s;s of the Gate, and Narrowne&s;s of the Way that leads to Life; nor of the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Sincere Repentance, true Faith and Obedience, to all the Command|ments of the Go&s;pel, in all &s;uch as Expect Salvation by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, of which the Participation in the Sacraments of the New-Te&s;tament of them&s;elves, give no A&s;&s;urance, as is evident from our Saviours an&s;wer at the Great Day to &s;uch as challenge, <HI>to have Eaten and Drank in his Pre&s;ence;</HI> yet am well a&s;&s;ured, they are the Ordinances and path of Life, in which every Chri&s;tian ought to walk; and I dare not my &s;elf, as one of the Stewards in Gods Hou&s;e, refu&s;e his Bread to &s;uch as regularly demand it, upon the Tearms mentioned in this &s;mall Tract, in which I am well confirmed by the Practice of &s;o many Prote&s;tant Churches; nor am I at all Startled by
<PB N="97" REF="001433_0103_0FB2FBDBC8FAE3A0">any mans Opinion to the contrary. All Prote&s;tants agree that there is no Infa|libility at <HI>Rome;</HI> and I know no body pretends to any el&s;e &s;ince the Apo&s;tles days; nor do I fear the Athenian accu&s;a|tion of Novelty any more than the great Apo&s;tle, and becau&s;e we mu&s;t all an&s;wer for our &s;elves to our Great Ma&s;ter, I am contented, and hope I live dayly in a Preparation for that Account. In the mean time, I will carry it as I ought to all good men of another Opinion, lea&s;t I be found beginning to beat my Fellow-Servant, when my Lord &s;hall come; being well a&s;&s;ured, That if a &s;trict di&s;cipline be maintained in the Churches of Chri&s;t, all Unworthy Com|municants will be far more ea&s;ily con|vinced and reformed, than if I &s;hould re|fu&s;e them what is their ju&s;t due, and thereby Scandalize them, to their Offence, and it may be to their Ruin.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Reformers of the Church from Popery proceeded well, but we &s;tayed not with <HI>Luther,</HI> &s;ince which the Prote&s;tant Churches have gone further; and I hope <HI>New-England,</HI> has done &s;omething more
