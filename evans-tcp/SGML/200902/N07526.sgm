<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>THE true <HI>Quaker,</HI> is loving, kind and re&s;pectful to all his Fellow Mortals, the fal&s;e ones, or them that would be call'd <HI>Quakers</HI> and are not &s;o: Are proud and high minded, greedy after Gain, fond of Places of Profit and Honour; &mdash;and when they are got therein, they are very apt to begin to Lord it over their Fellow Creatures: Nay! and to blame them without a ju&s;t Cau&s;e and be|lie them al&s;o I think.</P>
<P>THE true <HI>Quaker</HI> cannot have Unity with &s;uch and likewi&s;e findeth a Nece&s;&s;ity to reprove them, or &s;hew his Di&s;like to them; nay! let it be in what Society of People it may be in the World.</P>
<P>FOR let it be in what Society of People it may, the true hearted hone&s;t People cannot have Uni|ty with them.</P>
<P>I have often con&s;idered the End and Tendency of Talebearing, Wi&s;pering and Backbiting, and have ob&s;erved the evil Fruits and Effects thereof among Friends Neighbours and Relations.</P>
<P>IT is not po&s;&s;ible for Neighbours, Friends and Relations, nor for any Society of People to live together in Unity, Friend&s;hip and good Neigh|bourhood, while there goeth up and down a Tale|bearer among them, a Wi&s;perer among them; they are Numbered by <HI>St. Paul</HI> in his <HI>Epi&s;tle, Romans</HI> chap. the fir&s;t ver&s;e the 29, 30.

So they are Authors of much Mi&s;chief, and are in incon&s;i&s;tant with Peace, and where the&s;e Sort of Evildoers are en|tertained, their Words make Wounds not ea&s;ily cured or made up.</P>
<P>No Man living hath it in his Power to &s;ay, that he can pre&s;erve his Reputation, while there are &s;o many evil Tongues in the World ready to bla&s;t the faire&s;t Character, and &s;o many Ears open ready to receive the Report.</P>

<P><HI>Friends</HI> if to print the Truth is a Crime or Breach in our Di&s;cipline, it is more then ever I know of, for if Men of deep or large Under&s;tanding be hin|dered by Men that may not have &s;o large, &s;eemeth to me not to be rea&s;onable; and Men of le&s;s Un|der&s;tanding, may ca&s;t their Mite into the Trea|&s;ury without being hindered,</P>

<P>But my Cau&s;e is &s;omething wide from that, for I &s;aw no way to clear my&s;elf of tho&s;e Fal&s;hoods and Lyes, but by printing; for after I had &s;ent &s;o many Letters to &s;ome of them, to come and clear Matters that they had charged, or accu&s;ed me wrongfully, they would not.</P>

<P>HE that wrote the Hi&s;tory of the Devil, &s;aid the Devil is got into Men very much now adays;&mdash;I think &s;o too&mdash;otherwi&s;e I &s;hould not have been accu&s;ed fal&s;ely, &s;o often as I have been.</P>

<P>THOUGH I have loved my Reputation and have been vigilant, not to lo&s;e or impair it by my own default or neglect; yet I have looked upon it as a pritty Thing, a Thing that the Devil aims to hit in a &s;pecial Manner.&mdash;A Thing that is much in the Power of a fal&s;e Report, a mi&s;take.&mdash;Notwith|&s;tanding all my Care I am at the Mercy of others, without GOD'S wonderful Overruling Providence. And as my Reputation is the E&s;teem that others have of me; &s;o that E&s;teem may be blemi&s;hed without my default.&mdash;I have therefore always taken this Care, not to &s;et my heart upon my Reputati|on.

Buffins</HI> ANSWER, Yes: But my Controver&s;y is with them that is for healing or Skinning a Wound over and not &s;earch it to the Bottom; the which I can't no ways con&s;ent unto; for I think they are Surge|ons of no Value, &s;o I am forced to contend with them.</P>
<P>I could give you a large Account, how there are &s;ome that are going to make U&s;e of that knoty hollow deceitful Tree that I mentioned in my fir&s;t Book, for all Pillar in a great Hou&s;e or Church. But I think, they that choo&s;e that have no better Judgement then I had formerly, when I &s;aw but one Side of it, or it is a Sign that good Stuff is &s;carce.</P>
<P>It &s;eemeth to me by KING SALOMON &s;ayings, there are two Sorts of Fools. I think them, that are proud lorded over their Fellow Creatures and belie them, are one Sort</P>
<P>And as &s;ome in our Soceity hath gone wide from that humble meek Spirit, that our former Friends were in the Practice off. I find it my Duty to reprove &s;uch; and I hope it will be of &s;ome Service or Benefit to them, that are unborn, as well as to &s;ome now adays. And as the great Man from Town, &s;aid to me, that I was of an en|vious and malicious Spirit; and <HI>Peter Harvey</HI> &s;ent me Word, that if I was in a Strait for Money to go on with printing, he would help me to &s;ome.

<P>BUT find my&s;elf deeply engaged to reprove

them, that hath encroached on my Land, done their utmo&s;t endeavour to defame my Reputation, and belie me al&s;o.</P>
<P>EXPLANATION of my being a Surgeon; is that &s;ome hath been very urgent in per&s;wading of me to burn all my Writings and Printings, the which is a Thing I cannot anyways con&s;ent unto: untill &s;ome that hath blamed me without a Cau&s;e, and charged me fal&s;ely; are brought to own their Fault, or make out their Charge again&s;t me to be true; that which I compare to healing a Wound over, and not &s;earch, or clean&s;e it at the bottom.</P>
<P>As for <HI>William Jones</HI> and his Children, they not &s;aying what Part of my Book they could not under&s;tand; &s;o I cannot Explain it to them: But I am able to Explain all to Men of Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>My Friends I here think proper to mention &s;ome few Ver&s;es out of the Hi&s;tory of the Devil:&mdash;And are as followeth:</P>
<LG>
<L>When the Devil for weighty di&s;patches,</L>
<L>Wanted Me&s;&s;enges cunning and bold</L>
<L>He pa&s;ed by the beautiful Faces,</L>
<L>And picked out the ugly and old.</L>
<L>Of the&s;e he made Warlicks and Witches,</L>
<L>To run of his Errands by Night;</L>
<L>'Till the over-wrought hag-ridden wretches,</L>
<L>Were as fit as the Devil to fright.</L>
<L>But whoever has been his advi&s;er,</L>
<L>As his Kingdom increa&s;es in Growth;</L>
<L>He now takes his Mea&s;ures much wi&s;er</L>
<L>And Traficks with beauty and Youth.</L>
<L>Di&s;gui&s;ed in the wanton and witty,</L>
<L>He haunts both the Church and the Court;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="009609_0010_0F76F5DD7131AC78">
And &s;ometimes he vi&s;its the City,</L>
<L>Where all the be&s;t Chri&s;tians Re&s;ort.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus dre&s;&s;ed up in full Ma&s;quarade,</L>
<L>He the bolder can range up and down;</L>
<L>For he better can drive on his Trade,</L>
<L>In any ones Name than his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My Lucrebations concerning S. S.</L>
<L>He liveth about <HI>North-Ea&s;t</HI> from me, &s;o you may gue&s;s.</L>
</LG>
<P>To wit, for &s;everal Years pa&s;t I have been very Conver&s;ent with him, and thought he was my real Friend. But alas! He was &s;o much inclin'd to hold with the &s;tronge&s;t Side, (as he thought) or rather with the Multitude:&mdash;Though the Truth is always the &s;tronge&s;t.</P>
<P>I will prai&s;e and extole the mo&s;t High, who hath fed me with food convenient; and pre&s;erved me out of many Dangers: Who hath favoured me with a good Under&s;tanding, down to this very Day.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire to leave &s;omething as a Caution to the next Age, that they may be careful how they Lord it over their Fellow Creatures: Lea&s;t they &s;hould be as badly off as they that hath &s;trove to degrade my Reputation.</P>
<P>It is a Comfort now in old Age, that I have not been fond, or proud of Places of Honour, or Profit; though I have been in &s;everal Offices, both in Church and State,&mdash;or Town duties: And &s;o far as I know my&s;elf I have not been lifted up in my Mind,&mdash;when I had them, but zealou&s;ly concern'd that I might be faithful therein. I remember when the Meeting reque&s;ted of my Brother in-Law <HI>John Harvey</HI> to take the Office of Over&s;eer of our little
<PB N="11" REF="009609_0011_0F76F5DFEEE0EA60">
Meeting, that he was very loath, and &s;aid that he was not a quarter fit or it.&mdash;I think his Son is not half a quarter fit for that weighty Affair.&mdash;I &s;oon &s;poke from his proud hectering and fal&s;e Expre&s;&s;i|ons to me, and concerning me &s;oon after that he was put in the Office of Over&s;eer.</P>
<P>My Friends,&mdash;I here acquaint you of &s;ome few of <HI>Peter Harvey's</HI> quibbling An&s;wers to &s;ome of my 13&mdash;Queries that I reque&s;ted him to An&s;wer, being mo&s;tly Subjects that he had blam'd me.&mdash;The Re|mainder of them, I omit now for Brevity, they may be &s;een at my Hou&s;e in Writing. After a con&s;iderable deal of Pains taken by me, to bring him, he came, and &s;aid he came, becau&s;e he had &s;aid that he would meet me, and not on any other Account.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t <HI>Query,</HI> why I may not ask a rea&s;onable Price for my Bricks without being blam'd by thee, and at the &s;ame Time blam'd me for not telling of a Lye.</P>
<P>His An&s;wer to the fir&s;t <HI>Query</HI> was, if evil or wicked Men ask an unrea&s;onable price of a Neigh|bour for a Thing that he wanteth? he would leave it to any but Knaves or Fools to be Judge whether it was right or no, twice &s;aid over.</P>
<P><HI>Second Query,</HI> why I may not leave a Smith that I look on no better then a Thief without being blam'd by thee?</P>
<P>His <HI>An&s;wer.</HI> As the Smith was a poor Man, I ought not to leave him, my Cu&s;tom might be of Service or Benefit to him, and my leaving of him, might be a Hurt to his Reputation.</P>
<P><HI>Query the 5th.</HI> What Rea&s;on can thou give, for
<PB N="12" REF="009609_0012_0F76F5E0C9BF50C8">

<P><HI>7th. Query,</HI> What Rea&s;on can thou give for com|paring me to a dum Devil, and &s;ay at the &s;ame Time, that you had been too &s;lack or you had turn'd me off before now.</P>
<P><HI>The &s;eventh An&s;wer.</HI> His Rea&s;on, that I would not &s;peak to him once, with an Account of <HI>Tho|mas Middleton</HI> and his Son in Laws differing.</P>
<P><HI>Query the 8th.</HI> What Rea&s;on can thou give for &s;aying another Time that I was no better then a dum Devil.</P>
<P>His Rea&s;on, that I was of a dark, dark, dark Spirit; no other Rea&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>The Tenth Ouery,</HI> I de&s;ire to know whether thou hath done thy endeavour to bring <HI>Edward Catril,</HI> to make out his fal&s;e Charge again&s;t me.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer,</HI> He had asked him to come, but he refu&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>The Twelfth Query,</HI> Plea&s;e to make appear wherein I have ever wronged Man, Woman or Child in my Life, if thou can.</P>
<P>He and his Friend &s;aid, they did not Charge me of wronging any Body.</P>
<P>The foregoing, are &s;ome of <HI>Peter Harveys</HI> E|quivocating quibbling An&s;wers to &s;ome of my <HI>Queries</HI> on the 30th. of the 10th. <HI>Month,</HI> 1762.</P>

<P>It is &s;aid, in addre&s;ing a Per&s;on hold not thy Mouth &s;o near him as to bedew him with thy Breath: Yet <HI>Edward Catril</HI> had no more Manners the fir&s;t Time he came to my Hou&s;e, as to hold his Mouth &s;o near mine, that his Breath was in|tolerable to be boren by me, and &s;everal others almo&s;t as bad; e&s;pecially, when that Word dum Devil came out again&s;t me.</P>
<P>It can't be rea&s;onably expected that I &s;hould have much edifying or doctrinal Work, I being called chiefly to reprove Talebearers, Whi&s;perers, Backbiters and Lyars.</P>
<P>I look on it, that there is a Di&s;&s;cretionary Power to be made u&s;e of in Di&s;cipline; but I heard a Friend preach, that &s;ome would &s;tick to Di&s;cipline &s;o clo&s;e, that they would merely &s;plit a Hair: But none hath ever made it appear to me, where|in I hath ever made a Breach in Di&s;cipline, though I think my&s;elf able to make it appear wherein &s;everal hath fal&s;ely accu&s;ed me, or at lea&s;t I know it to be &s;o.</P>

<L>The true Chri&s;tians, their Minds are lowly, humble, mild, meek and wi&s;e,</L>
<L>They will not Lye, nor pride exalt their Eyes.</L>

<P>Conformity is in high account now adays, but let our Zeal for Conformity be never &s;o great; it is he, that ordereth his Conver&s;ation a right that &s;hall &s;ee the Salvation of GOD, and not to pin our Faith on others Sleeves as compared to.</P>
<P>A &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e between a Doctor and a Law|yer. Doctor, I think <HI>Peter Harvey</HI> and <HI>Catril,</HI> are got Purs proud, if I had them to phy&s;ick and purge, I would endeavour to Remedy that. <HI>Law|yer,</HI> it <HI>Buffin</HI> would employ me, I would endea|vour to drean them both; e&s;pecially for calling his Writings Libels, and defaming the Tittle of his Land. <HI>Tattler,</HI> I think <HI>Buffin</HI> will have a Writ on <HI>Catrils</HI> Back if they turn him off as <HI>Harvey</HI> hath it. And as for <HI>Harvey,</HI> I think he hath paid him pritty well for his Fal&s;hoods, <HI>to wit,</HI> in his Printing. As <HI>Peter</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Buffin</HI> that the <HI>Phila|delphia</HI> Friends thought <HI>Catril</HI> and <HI>Noble</HI> were as notable Friends as any we had among&s;t us. I think if there is no notabler Friends among us, then they are, I think the Lord will not &s;pare us long, if they conduct to others as they have done to <HI>Buffin,</HI> O! that I could find &s;ome faithful up|right zealous hone&s;t Men, that would do their ut|mo&s;t Endeavour to find out the Lying deceitfull Men, and bring them to Ju&s;tice that keep &s;narling at me, becau&s;e I oppo&s;e them in their Lying.</P>
<LG>
<L>But I think of late &s;uch Men are almo&s;t as rare,</L>
<L>As black Swans, with Stream white Crows in Air.</L>
</LG>
<P>Or at lea&s;t what I find of them, I never yet

could find out the Rea&s;on of their Defaming my Reputation, the Tittle of my Land and belying me al&s;o.</P>
<P>I was a Man formerly that entertained a many notable publick Friends and others at my Hou&s;e, and was willing to &s;pend and be &s;pent: And now I am as willing to &s;pent and be &s;pent, in Reprov|ing &s;ome of this new fal&s;e Generation that hath belyed me.</P>
<P>I have been obraided of having one Foot in the Grave &s;ome Years ago; I now acquaint you, he that &s;aid &s;o, hath got one Eye in the Grave com|paratively &s;peaking.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand that <HI>Peter Harvey</HI> would have &s;ent to the Monthly Meeting in Writing, that all was well at our &s;mall Meeting, only &s;ome received <HI>John Buffins</HI> Books. But &s;ome that had a little more Sen&s;e would not alow of it.</P>
<P>So my Friends, I knowing Time is &s;hort to all of us on this teri&s;tical Globe, I am willing to leave &s;ome Thing after in my Days are over in this World, that People may be careful and not to lord it over the&s;e Fellow Mortals.</P>
<P>My Friends, I had &s;ome Seeds of a fine Fruit, as reported, that came from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> that was extoled for healing new or old Wounds or Sores; but alas my Friends! I found no more help or benefit by them, then I did by the two extoled Friends that came from thence, though that Fruit did me no Harm, though I think the other hath or would if they could. One asked me whether I did not preach &s;ometimes? and another, why I did not preach? I think I do of
<PB N="17" REF="009609_0017_0F76F5E44139DBA8">
late by Books. But my Lot is mo&s;tly in the way of Reproof to them in our Society, as hath been the Lot of publick Friends formerly as well as of late.</P>
<P>My Friends, I here acquaint you that I was a married Man 38 Year and Nine Months, I don't remember that my Wife gave me a cro&s;s or angry Word in any of that Time; and &s;he was a han|&s;om notable and indu&s;trious Woman, and could talk as well as others, though &s;ome Women thought &s;he could not by Rea&s;on, &s;he did not &s;cold &s;ome|times.</P>
<P>As <HI>Peter Harvey</HI> &s;aid to me, that my Coun|tenance &s;howed I was no Friend, I think that there was &s;omebody &s;aw as far into him, or he ought not to have wrote on his Gate; this is the Way to <HI>Judas</HI> his Hou&s;e, nor to have wrote on the other Side of the Road: This is the Way to <HI>Peter Harveys</HI> bra&s;on GODS.</P>
<P>My Scholars are not come to their Speech again, neither have they turn'd me out of the School as yet. So no more Account of them, until the next.</P>
