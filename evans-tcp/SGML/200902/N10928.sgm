<HEAD><HI>REMARKS</HI> on the Nature and bad Effects of <HI>SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE common u&s;e of Spirituous liquors di&s;tilled from mola&s;&s;es, grain, fruit, &amp;c. is a matter that calls for the particular attention of every lover of mankind.</P>
<P>Several phy&s;icians of note, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctors Hoffman, Cheyne, Short, Lind, Buchan, &amp;c.</NOTE> have given it as their &s;entiments, that tho&s;e di&s;tilled &s;pi|rits when taken inwardly, even tho' mixed with water, de&s;troy the human frame; being burning &s;pirits, the u&s;e of which bring on many fatal di&s;ea&s;es, &s;uch as fevers, jaundice, drop&s;ies, con&s;umptions, and whereby multi|tudes are daily de&s;troyed. That they parch up and contract the &s;tomach to half its na|tural &s;ize, like burnt leather, and rot the entrails, as is evident, not only by opening the bodies of tho&s;e per&s;ons who are killed by drinking them; but al&s;o by what Doctor Hoffman &s;ays, was ob&s;erved of the effects which the cau&s;tic fiery remaining wa&s;h of the di&s;tillers, has on the guts of tho&s;e hogs which in &s;ome places are fed by it, which are thereby &s;o tendered, that puddings can|not be made in them: Wherefore all people, who have any regard to their health and lives,
<PB N="2" REF="013831_0002_0F91B180E63FB3C8">ought to tremble at the cravings for &s;uch poi&s;onous liquors, which &s;horten and de&s;troy the lives of &s;uch multitudes of people. It is farther ob&s;ervable, that the free u&s;e of tho&s;e Spirits, deprave the morals of tho&s;e who addict them&s;elves thereto; the feelings of their minds are gradually benumbed; an in&s;en&s;ibility to the healing influences of grace prevails, and many become prophane and re|gardle&s;s of their duty to God and Man.</P>
<P>Doctor Cheyne in his E&s;&s;ay of health and long life, &s;ays, "All people, who have any regard to their health and lives, ought to tremble at the fir&s;t cravings for &s;uch poi&s;onous liquors. The maladies begot by them bring forth nece&s;&s;ity upon nece&s;&s;ity of drams and gills; till at la&s;t, a kind drop&s;y, nervous convul&s;ion, flux, if not a fever, or phren&s;y &s;ets the poor &s;oul free. It has often rai&s;ed in me, &s;ays the Doctor, the mo&s;t me|lancholly reflections, to &s;ee the virtuous and &s;en&s;ible, bound in &s;uch chains and fetters, as nothing le&s;s than omnipotent grace or the unrelenting grave could relea&s;e them from."</P>
<P>It is pretended, that drams comfort, warm, and defend from the &s;everity of wea|ther, to which men are &s;ometimes expo&s;ed; without which they &s;ay, they &s;hould peri&s;h with cold; which is probably, in a great mea&s;ure, true of tho&s;e who are habituated to drink them; the blood of &s;uch being thereby &s;o much improveri&s;hed, that it is
<PB N="3" REF="013831_0003_0F91B181C46FD188" MS="y">well known many of the drinkers of drams are cold and lifele&s;s in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, without frequent repetitions; this is what &s;ome of them have owned. But on the other hand, how much more able are &s;ober per&s;ons to endure cold and hard&s;hips; their vital heat not being extingui&s;hed by intem|perance, does by its kindly genial warmth, more effectually &s;ecure them from the in|clemency of the weather, than the fal&s;e fla&s;h of a dram. Be&s;ides, it is well known, that men did not peri&s;h in the colde&s;t countries for want of drams formerly, when they were not to be had, of the undoubted truth of this, Captain Ellis gives a full proof in the account of his voyage to Hud&s;on's bay, page 199: Where he ob&s;erves, "That the natives of the very cold coa&s;t of that Bay, to whom the French are kinder than to &s;ell di&s;tilled &s;pirituous liquors, are tall, hardy, robu&s;t and active; whereas tho&s;e of them that are &s;upplied with drams from the Eng|li&s;h, are a meagre, dwarfi&s;h, indolent people, hardly equal to the feverity of the country and &s;ubject to many di&s;orders. And as to the pernicious effects of &s;pirituous liquors in very hot climates, (as on the coa&s;t of Guinea) it is ob&s;erved, that the French and Portugue&s;e, who do not indulge in di&s;tilled &s;pirits, are healthy compared with the Engli&s;h; who, drinking freely of &s;pirits, &amp;c. die fa&s;t."</P>
<P>The unhappy dram-drinkers are &s;o ab&s;o|lutely bound in &s;lavery to the&s;e infernal &s;pi|rits,
<PB N="4" REF="013831_0004_0F91B182676FDB10">that they &s;eem to have lo&s;t the power of delivering them&s;elves from this wor&s;t of bondage. How much then is it the bounden duty of tho&s;e, who have it in their power to withhold this de&s;tructive man-bane, either as parents, ma&s;ters, or rulers to the people committed to their tru&s;t. This is a ca&s;e &s;o calamitous to mankind, that to have a tho|rough &s;en&s;e of it, and yet not to remon&s;trate, nor earne&s;tly caution again&s;t it, is certainly as criminal as it is unfriendly not to warn a blind per&s;on of a dangerous precipice or pit. Yet, alas how unconcerned are the greate&s;t part of mankind at this enormous ruin of multitudes! In trials for life, what diligence is u&s;ed to find the occa&s;ion of the lo&s;s of one &s;ubject. What care will not a faithful Phy&s;ician be&s;tow for the pre&s;ervation of one life. How did the wi&s;e Romans honour him, who &s;aved the life of one Roman citi|zen. But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e it is not one, nor one hundred, nor one thou&s;and, but probably no le&s;s than a million that peri&s;h yearly.</P>
<P>The mi&s;taken u&s;e and grievous abu&s;e of rum and other di&s;tilled &s;pirits, in no ca&s;e appears more palpably than at the time of harve&s;t, a bu&s;ine&s;s which the people under the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation were enjoined to carry on with humiliation and thank&s;giving; but which among&s;t us, through the free u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, is made an occa&s;ion of a greater abu&s;e of the creatures and di&s;ho|nour
<PB N="5" REF="013831_0005_0F91B1845C681070">of the Creator; this ari&s;es in many, from a mi&s;taken per&s;ua&s;ion that hard labour, particularly that of the harve&s;t field, cannot be carried on without u&s;ing a quantity of rum or other di&s;tilled &s;pirits. In &s;upport of this opinion, we are frequently told of the many people who have died at tho&s;e times through the extream heat and fatigue, and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that many more would die, if a plentiful u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors was not allowed; but this is a mi&s;taken notion, it being much more likely that the free u&s;e of rum occa&s;ioned the death of tho&s;e people, the quantity they had &s;wallowed down, &s;ending a great flow of &s;pirits into the head in pro|portion to the &s;trength of their body, cau&s;ed them to &s;train their &s;trength beyond what nature could bear; and in general the re|peated large quantities of &s;pirit commonly drank during the whole time of harve&s;t, keeps up the blood in &s;o continual a ferment and fever, that people cannot have a pro|per re&s;torative &s;leep; their con&s;titutions are thereby enervated, their lives &s;hortened and an unfitne&s;s for religious impre&s;&s;ions gene|rally prevails.</P>
<P>The&s;e weighty con&s;iderations have induced &s;ome well minded people to endeavour to induce, by their examples, their friends and neighbours into a contrary practice; and un|der the&s;e attempts experience has made it manife&s;t that very little or no &s;trong liquor is nece&s;&s;ary at tho&s;e times; indeed they have
<PB N="6" REF="013831_0006_0F91B184B5873770">been convinced that the harve&s;t, and other laborious work, can be very well managed without making u&s;e of any &s;pirituous liquors at all. If &s;uch labour was carried on with &s;teadine&s;s and proper moderation, there would certainly be no need of a recruit of &s;trength being &s;ought for by that means; more frequent intervals of re&s;t, with a little food oftener allowed the reapers, and &s;mall drinks, &s;uch as mola&s;&s;es and water, either alone or made more agreeable with a little cider, &s;mall beer, or even milk and water would fully enable them to perform their work to their employer's &s;atisfaction and their own advantage, and the overplus wages they would receive to the value of the &s;pirits u&s;ually given them, might be &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e bread for their families. Several per&s;ons who from a per&s;ua&s;ion that the com|mon method of giving &s;pirituous liquors to labourers was exceeding hurtful, have made it a condition with tho&s;e they have employ|ed, not to u&s;e any &s;pirituous liquors in their fields; the&s;e have had their work performed to good &s;atisfaction and without any damage en&s;uing to their labourers. Nay, where they have remained any con&s;iderable time with &s;uch employers, they have generally acknowledged them&s;elves &s;en&s;ible of the be|nefit ari&s;ing from having thus totally refrain|ed the u&s;e of tho&s;e liquors.</P>
<P>Should this practice take place, it would prove a great ble&s;&s;ing, particularly to the la|bouring
<PB N="7" REF="013831_0007_0F91B18580B4E0B0">people, one half of whom (a phy|&s;ician of this country hath given as his &s;en|timent) die &s;ooner than they otherwi&s;e would do, &s;olely by the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors. Be&s;ides that, it would di&s;courage the di&s;til|lation of rye and other grain; a practice which is not only a great hurt to the poor in rai&s;ing the price of bread, but mu&s;t al&s;o be very offen&s;ive to God the great and good father of the family of mankind, that people &s;hould, in their earthly and corrupt wi&s;dom, pervert their Maker's benevolent intention, in converting the grain he hath given to us as the &s;taff of life, unto a fiery &s;pirit, &s;o de|&s;tructive of the human frame and attended with the other dreadful con&s;equences alrea|dy mentioned. Here it may be noted, that any quantity of good mola&s;&s;es will by di&s;til|lation, yield more than the &s;ame quantity of proof &s;pirit. And that a con&s;iderable quan|tity of mola&s;&s;es if taken with bread at one time, as the Indians will &s;ometimes do, will not intoxicate, the &s;pirituous parts in the mola&s;&s;es being properly united, by our good and wi&s;e creator, with the earthy and bal&s;a|mick parts, &s;o as to make it quite friendly to our nature; but when by di&s;tillation the &s;pirituous parts are &s;eparated from the other parts, that mea&s;ure of &s;pirits proceeding from the &s;ame quantity of mola&s;&s;es, becomes a fiery liquid, de&s;tructive of the human frame. Doctor Buchan in his Dome&s;tic Medicine, or Family Phy&s;ician, a book which has gain|ed
<PB N="8" REF="013831_0008_0F91B1865AE62F48">&s;o much e&s;teem as to be twice publi&s;hed in this city, at page 71 of the Engli&s;h Edi|tion &s;ays, <Q>many imagine that hard labour could not be &s;upported without drinking &s;trong liquors. This, tho' a common is a very erroneous notion, men who never ta&s;ted &s;trong liquors are not only able to endure more fatigue, but al&s;o live much longer than tho&s;e who u&s;e them daily. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor Smollet, in the account of his travels, &s;peaking of the bad effects even of fermented liquors, ob&s;erves, ' The longer I live, the more I am convinc|ed that wine and all fermented liquors are pernicious to the human con&s;titution, and that for the pre&s;ervati|on of health and exhileration of the &s;pirits, there is no beverage comparable to &s;imple water.</NOTE> But &s;uppo&s;e &s;trong liquors did enable a man to do more work, they mu&s;t never|thele&s;s wa&s;te the powers of life, and of cour&s;e occa&s;ion premature old age. They keep up a con&s;tant fever, which wa&s;tes the &s;pirits, heats and inflames the blood and predi&s;po&s;es the body to numberle&s;s di&s;ea&s;es. At page the &s;ame author tells us, that all intoxicating liquors may be con&s;idered as poi&s;ons. However di&s;gui&s;|ed, that is their real character, and &s;ooner or later they will have their effect.</Q></P>
<P>Among&s;t the &s;everal prejudices in favour of the mi&s;taken u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, there is none gives it a greater &s;anction or &s;upport, than the prevailing opinion, even with per&s;ons of reputation, that what they term a moderate quantity of rum mixed
<PB N="9" REF="013831_0009_0F91B186E8182518">with water, is the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t liquor that can be drank; hence confirming the opini|on, that &s;pirit in one form or other is nece&s;|&s;ary. To &s;uch who have not been accu&s;tom|ed, and think they cannot habituate them|&s;elves to drink water, there may appear to be &s;ome kind of plea in this argument, e&s;pecially to travellers, who often meet with beer, cider, or other fermented liquors that are dead, hard, &s;our, or not properly fer|mented, which tend to generate air in the bowels, producing colicks, &amp;c. But if tho&s;e per&s;ons &s;uffered the weight of the &s;ub|ject, and the encouragement they thereby give to the u&s;e of tho&s;e de&s;tructive &s;pirits, to take proper place with them, it might &s;ugge&s;t the propriety, if not nece&s;&s;ity of in|troducing a more &s;alutary practice.</P>
<P>That pure fluid (water) which the benevo|lent father of the family of mankind, points out for general u&s;e, is &s;o analogous to the human frame, that people might with &s;afety gradually u&s;e them&s;elves to it. Dr. Cheyne ob&s;erves, that without all doubt, water is the primitive original beverage, as it is the only &s;imple fluid fitted for diluting, moi&s;ten|ing and cooling; the ends of drink, appoint|ed by nature, and he adds happy had it been for the race of mankind, if other mix|ed and artificial liquors had never been in|vented. Water alone is &s;ufficient and effec|tual for all the purpo&s;es of human want in drink: Strong liquors were never de&s;igned
<PB N="10" REF="013831_0010_0F91B187A32C7C70">for common u&s;e. Speaking of the effect of wine, which he &s;ays to have been &s;o much in u&s;e at the time he wrote, that the better &s;ort of people &s;carcely diluted their food with any other liquor, he remarks, <Q>That as natural cau&s;es will always produce their proper effects, their blood was in|flamed in gout, &s;tone, and rheumati&s;m, raging fevers, pleuri&s;ies, &amp;c. Water is the only di&s;olvent or men&s;truum, and the mo&s;t certain diluter of all bodies proper for food.</Q></P>
<P>Doctor Short, in his di&s;cour&s;e of the in|ward u&s;e of water, &s;peaks much in its com|mendation. He &s;ays, we can draw a very convincing argument of the excellency of water, from the longevity and healthfulne&s;s of tho&s;e who at fir&s;t had no better liquor, and the health and &s;trength of body and ferenity of mind, of tho&s;e who at this day have no other common liquor to drink, of this the common people among&s;t the Highlands of Scotland, are a &s;ufficient in|&s;tance, among&s;t whom it is no rarity to find per&s;ons of eighty, ninety, yea an hundred years of age, as healthy, &s;trong and nimble, as wine or ale bibbers are at thirty &s;ix or forty. The Doctor &s;ays, There is a ridicul|ous maxim u&s;ed by drinkers, that water makes but thin blood, not fit for bu&s;ine&s;s. I &s;ay, &s;ays he, it is water only that can en|duce its drinkers with the &s;tronge&s;t bodies and mo&s;t robu&s;t con&s;titutions, where execi&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="013831_0011_0F91B188CD8F4870">or labour is joined with it, &s;ince it be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ts the &s;tomach and lungs to reduce the aliments into the &s;malle&s;t particles, that they may better pa&s;s the &s;trainers of the body, which &s;eparates the nutritious parts of the blood to be applyed to the &s;ides of the of the ve&s;&s;els, and exerci&s;e invigorates the fibres and mu&s;cles; whereas the rapid motion of blood exci|ted by drinking &s;pirituous liquors, cannot fail of be|ing prejudicial to the body, it will cau&s;e the watery parts to di&s;&s;ipate, and the remaining to grow thick and tough, and the event be ob&s;tructions, inflamma|tions, impo&s;thumations, &amp;c.&mdash;and tho' &s;trong li|quors afford a greater flow of &s;pirits for a &s;hort time, yet this is always followed with as much lowne&s;s of &s;pirit; &s;o that to gain a nece&s;&s;ary &s;tock of &s;pirits, the per&s;on is obliged to repeat the &s;ame force, till he learns a cu&s;tom of drinking drams. In this we are confirm|ed, if we con&s;ider the great &s;trength and hardine&s;s of poor ru&s;ticks in many parts of the world, who&s;e provi&s;ions is mo&s;tly vegetable food, and their drink water. The Doctor adds, that it often happens that per&s;ons of tender, weakly, crazy con&s;titutions, by refraining from &s;trong liquors and accu&s;toming them|&s;elves to drink water, make a &s;hift to &s;pin out many years.</P>
<P>After de&s;cribing the many di&s;tempers produced by drinking malt or other fermented liquors he adds, that &s;eeing con&s;titutions differ, it is not to be expect|ed that &s;pirituous liquors &s;hould produce all the &s;ame &s;ymptoms in one and the &s;ame per&s;on, yet that all drinkers have &s;everal of them; and if they come not to that height, it is becau&s;e they afterwards u&s;e great exerci&s;e or hard labour, with &s;ometimes thin diluting liquors, which prevent their immediate hurting.</P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to &s;uch well di&s;po&s;ed people, who &s;till retain a favourable opinion of the u&s;e of &s;pirits mixed with water, ought they not, even from love to mankind, to endeavour to refrain from it,
<PB N="12" REF="013831_0012_0F91B18941674C78">on account of the effect their example may have in en|couraging others in the u&s;e of &s;pirituous, liquors, a|greeable to the example left us by the apo&s;tle Paul, 1. Cor. viii. 13. <HI>If meat make my brother to offend I will eat no fle&s;h white the world &s;tands, le&s;t I make my brother to offend.</HI> How much more ought they to refrain from that which tends to e&s;tabli&s;h mankind, in a practice &s;o generally de&s;tructive, more e&s;pecially when they con&s;ider the danger them&s;elves are in of encrea&s;ing the quantity of &s;pirit with their water, as it has been ob&s;erved, that the u&s;e of this mixture is particularly apt, almo&s;t imperceptible to gain up|on tho&s;e that u&s;e it, &s;o that many otherwi&s;e good and judicious people have unwarily to them&s;elves and others, fallen, with the common herd, a &s;acrifice to this might devourer.</P>
<P>A very eminent phy&s;ician has given the following direction, for the benefit of tho&s;e who have not wi&s;|dom enough left at once to abandon the odious and pernicious practice of drinking di&s;tilled &s;pirituous li|quors, <HI>viz.</HI> By degrees to mix water with the &s;pirit, to le&s;&s;en the quantity every day, and keep to the &s;ame quantity of water, till in about the cour&s;e of a week, nothing of the dram kind be u&s;ed along with water. By this means the per&s;on will &s;uffer no in|conveniency, but reap great benefit upon leaving off drams or &s;pirits as has been tried by many. If any gnawing be left in the &s;tomach upon quite leaving it off, a little warm broth, weak tea, or any thing of that kind, will be a &s;ervice. The appetite always increa&s;es in a few days after leaving off drams, un|le&s;s by the too long continuance of them, the tone of the &s;tomach is de&s;troyed. And when the &s;tomach is thus affected a cup of carduus, camomile, worm|wood or centaury tea, every morning fa&s;ting and eve|ry evening will be found a good remedy.</P>
