<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following pathetic, and moving ex|hortations, were, as carefully as po&s;&s;ible, taken down in characters, as they flow'd from the lips of the preacher to large and crowded au|diences; at which were pre&s;ent numbers of dif|ferent per&s;ua&s;ions: many of whom have reque&s;ted copies of the tran&s;cript; and others have de&s;ired, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, that they might be made &s;till more public, by means of the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>THE writer is de&s;irous of obliging many, without offence to any individual.&mdash;The manu|&s;cript hath been read and approved of, by num|bers of &s;uperior judgment, who were pre&s;ent; and who have join'd in this opinion, that from their being publi&s;h'd, good may proceed to the well di&s;po&s;ed; nor can any kind of harm be fore|&s;een to accrue from hence.</P>
<P>AND it is probable that the prejudices which &s;ome have conceived again&s;t the faith and princi|ples of the Quakers, (as a people &s;eperated from the e&s;tabli&s;h'd church,) may be removed, from a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate peru&s;al of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, which is a rea&s;on, of it&s;elf &s;ufficient, for their being made public.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="010615_0003_0F81B9B16DDE8208">THE writer is not con&s;cious of having mi&s;taken the author's &s;en&s;e: And if to the memory of any who were then pre&s;ent, there &s;hould occur any variations from his immediate expre&s;&s;ions, the editor is a&s;&s;ured there can be but few, and tho&s;e not of moment; he having to the readie&s;t expe|dition, joined the mo&s;t perfect attention, tho' in a crowded congregation (where he could have no other re&s;t, or &s;upport, than the hand or the knee.)</P>
<P>INDEED! the lively force and heart-felt energy with which the &s;ub&s;equent exhortations were de|livered, mu&s;t remain from that time wanting: nor is it material to offer, that it is not in the power of the mo&s;t faithful tran&s;criber, to con|vey that enforcing part to his readers. The texts, i. e. chapter and ver&s;e, have been &s;ince added, in order to illu&s;trate the work, and ren|der it (if po&s;&s;ible!) more plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>THE editor hath likewi&s;e taken down (by de|&s;ire) two other Sermons, from the &s;ame preacher; the &s;ubject: of the fir&s;t taken from the prayer of Augur, <HI>Prov.</HI> xxx. 7, 8, and 9. the other from <HI>Cant.</HI> iv. and 12, and at the clo&s;e of each, a Prayer; but tho&s;e will continue in manu&s;cript, unle&s;s a public edition of them be encouraged.</P>

<HEAD>The following Sermon was delivered, on Sunday morn|ing the 17th day of May, <HI>1767,</HI> at the <HI>opening</HI> of the yearly meeting, at the Fryers, in Bri&s;tol.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xx. 9.</NOTE>Art thou in health; my brother?</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IT hath been in my mind to adopt the language or &s;alutation of Joab to Ama&s;a; but with &s;enti|ments different, far different, from tho&s;e which actuated the treachery of Joab; even tho&s;e of true and tender affection, and with a mind repleni&s;hed with that charity, which wi&s;heth well to all.</P>
<Q>Art thou in health; my brother?</Q>
<P>I COULD wi&s;h, with all po&s;&s;ible &s;olicitude, to lead every mind pre&s;ent, into the mo&s;t careful enquiry, in re&s;pect to their &s;piritual &s;tate of health; and to their immediate relation, and affinity, to that &s;upreme almighty Being, who is the ju&s;t and awful judge of quick and dead. I fear it hath proceeded from too anxious a &s;olicitude for the health of your bodies, and pro&s;perity of your temporal concerns, that too many of you have too frequently, and in a manner totally, neglected the great concern of your immortal &s;ouls; which is indeed <HI>the one thing needful.</HI></P>
<P>THOSE temporal concerns, I &s;ay, which are of a trifling peri&s;hing nature, have, I fear! interrupted and taken off from this principle concern: your anxiety and application towards the attainment of the trea&s;ures and the enjoyment of the plea|&s;ures of the world, have occa&s;ioned too great a neglect of your religious duty.</P>
<P>THE coveniencies of life are, by no means, a contemptible concern, where they are bounded with temperance, and con|fin'd within their proper channel: but as there is a part in us of infinitely greater, of no le&s;s than eternal moment; it al&s;o
<PB N="6" REF="010615_0005_0F81B9B2EEF679E8">
requires an attention proportionable to its proper worth; for what are temporal concerns, when compared with the import|ant one of eternity!</P>
<P>THE <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the body is &s;ubject to divers maladies; and when we have done our utmo&s;t to pre&s;erve it, we &s;hall find in the end (and how &s;oon that may be none knows) that it is of nece&s;&s;ity &s;ubject to the &s;troke of death, and to the inclo&s;ure of the grave.</P>
<P>I HAVE therefore thought it by no means an improper en|quiry for each individual to make, and deeply ponder, What is thy &s;tate, or how is it with thee, O my &s;oul! who art capa|ble of partaking of immortal joys, and de&s;tin'd to triumph over death and the grave? <HI>When this earthly, tabernacle &s;hall be di&s;&s;olv'd,</HI> thy appointment and de&s;tination, if in proper &s;ound|ne&s;s for it, &s;hall be made perfect with the whole family of GOD, and be no longer &s;ubject to the di&s;ea&s;es, pains, trials and afflictions of this life, but &s;hare the things which are of GOD, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 23.&mdash;</NOTE> <HI>With the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t-born, who&s;e names are written in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>AS this is of the mo&s;t infinite importance to the &s;ons of men, I have thought it my particular duty, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, to put you in mind of the nece&s;&s;ary enquiry into the &s;tate of your &s;piritual health; the conditon of your immortal &s;ouls: being very apprehen&s;ive that all of you, my brethren, are not in perfect health, who have outwardly the appear|ance of health; but that, on the contrary, many are in a dan|gerous &s;tate of di&s;ea&s;e and &s;tupefaction; have only pre&s;erved a lethargic frame, and are tottering upon the brink of de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>THIS enquiry into the pre&s;ent &s;tate of experience and of advancement in the work of &s;alvation, hath branched it&s;elf out in my view, and divided into &s;everal cla&s;&s;es, tho&s;e who are now within the audience of my voice. And, in the fir&s;t place, I intreat the attention of you, the elders, among&s;t whom our LORD, as among&s;t &s;o many &s;hepherds, hath di|vided his flock; over whom you are appointed to watch, and and to teach them to per&s;evere in the path which leadeth to eternal life!</P>
<P>YOU have experienced the power of religion; you have <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 12.</NOTE>

<P>IF tho&s;e that have been called with an high and holy cal|ling, as delegated &s;hepherds under the one great &s;hepherd, walk uprightly in his fear and to his glory; then the &s;heep will with them be more likely to be gained upon to follow the great &s;hepherd; they will then have a frequent de&s;ire, a long|ing appetite after the divine Manna, which cometh down from GOD out of Heaven: for every life hath its food and its pro|per nutriment; and a &s;oul panting after Heaven can be &s;a|tisfied with nothing &s;hort of the <HI>food</HI> from Heaven.</P>
<P>IN the next place, I addre&s;s <HI>you,</HI> my brethren in the work of the mini&s;try, reminding you of its divine in&s;titution, all that have enter'd rightly into it <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. 4&mdash;</NOTE> <HI>being called of God, as was Aaron.</HI></P>

He will make you, if with due con&s;tancy ye adhere to, and attend on him, a &s;a|cred and fixed flame of love, and of light never to be extigui&s;h|ed: your care, and pains, and labour here will be but a mo|ment, your reward will be <HI>a crown of life everla&s;ting.</HI> The bread that you eat, and the water that you drink, and of which ye mini&s;ter their due &s;hare unto others, will be daily &s;pringing up in you unto everla&s;ting life!

<P><PB N="8" REF="010615_0007_0F81B9B45871DFA0">INDEED it hath &s;ometimes happened that &s;ome of the mi|ni&s;ters <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 1, 2.</NOTE> <HI>&s;tewards of the my&s;tery of God,</HI> have not been <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to what he required. Be ever mindful of the nece<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters"> of putting on and wearing the &s;piritual robes, prefigured by tho&s;e of <HI>Aaron:</HI> the holy girdle about the loins; the brea&s;t-plate, with the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummin;</HI> the <HI>Bell</HI> and the <HI>Pomegranate.</HI> Some indeed have had the <HI>Bell</HI> &s;ending forth an empty unavailing &s;ound, but have wanted the <HI>Pome|granate,</HI> the &s;oul-enlivening fruit of the good &s;pirit of CHRIST, our everla&s;ting high prie&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>But I hope better things of you,</HI> beloved in CHRIST, <HI>and things that accompany &s;alvation.</HI> I am &s;ure we have need, with the utmo&s;t diligence, appplication, and care, to keep the loins of our minds girded about: we had need to &s;tand upon the watch: we have great need to maintain the utmo&s;t &s;teadine&s;s: for if we who &s;tand in the fore front, &s;hould fall, we fall not alone: if we &s;lide from the path of truth, who among&s;t us will be able to &s;tand!</P>
<P>WE ought to be endued with the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom, of judg|ment, and with &s;ound minds, which he hath promi&s;ed to them that ask this ble&s;&s;ing from him, and hath made good his promi&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Are you in health, my brethren?</HI> are you &s;trongly attached to the promotion and exhaltation of that glorious cau&s;e which you have embarked in? have each of you a &s;hare in and a proper care of the LORD's work? do you watch over the flock attending on your mini&s;try, under the great &s;hepherd, and with the tenderne&s;s of go&s;pel love, <HI>&s;eeking to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>I FREELY confe&s;s my own &s;ears, that I am not in a &s;tate of perfect health and &s;ound mind; labouring as I ought in the work of the LORD. As it is a task of the utmo&s;t importance, I ought to remain ever diffident of my own care, and to watch daily in the di&s;charge of a tru&s;t &s;o great and important as that of the recovery and pre&s;ervation <HI>of the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>THE pro&s;tration of the &s;oul before the GOD and Father of mercies, in a cau&s;e of &s;uch infinite concern, is a continual duty, which can &s;carce ever be &s;ufficiently di&s;charged. The &s;ecret cry of my &s;oul has, after this manner, frequently ari&s;en,
<PB N="9" REF="010615_0008_0F81B9B85B251CA8">
"LORD! &s;pare thy people and ble&s;s thine heritage." I am fully per&s;uaded, my friends, were all the mini&s;ters and elders more ble&s;&s;ed with &s;ound health, the minds of the flock would be more fill'd with brotherly kindne&s;s, and more and more ap|proach to that &s;tate which I have mentioned, they would know what is meant by the <HI>angels being &s;pirits,</HI> and how to under&s;tand his <HI>mini&s;ters being a flame of fire.</HI></P>
<P>I COME now to another cla&s;s, whom I mean to addre&s;s un|der the title of tho&s;e within the audience of my voice, who continue in a &s;ingle &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>Are you in health; my brethren and &s;i&s;ters?</HI> are you po&s;&s;e&s;t of inward virtue, and of ability to live to GOD, as becometh his &s;aints; and which alone will lead you to eternal life; do you a&s;pire after the&s;e, with an unabated zeal?</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t not expect always to re&s;t &s;atisfied with the good things of this life. The day may come when you will loath the abundance of your temporal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: you will then be concerned that you have &s;o indulgently <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haggai i. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>dwelt in ceiled hou&s;es, and have let the hou&s;e of God lie wa&s;te.</HI> Then you would be glad to have exchanged the fading plea&s;ures of life for the &s;ub&s;tantial joys of eternity.</P>
<P>RECOLLECT your&s;elves in the &s;pring time of life; con&s;ider early the importance of this exchange, while you have it in your power to make it Look up to an object more glorious than the pre&s;ent world can afford you, even the joys of that eternal inheritance, which <HI>the children of the fir&s;t-born, the in|numerable company of happy &s;pirits, the general a&s;&s;embly of ju&s;t men already made perfect,</HI> are repleni&s;hed with.&mdash;Plea&s;ures un&s;peakable! that exi&s;t for evermore!</P>
<P><HI>Art thou in health; my brother?</HI>&mdash;my dear brethren, are ye fervently engaged in labouring, nece&s;&s;ary labouring, for the promotion of the cau&s;e of GOD upon earth?</P>
<P>O YE parents and heads of families, who are placed as de|legated &s;hepherds over them; timely beware, le&s;t the blood of your children, or of any part of your charge, fall on your heads: (if through your mi&s;conduct they become corrupted, and their &s;ouls peri&s;h.) Know that inqui&s;ition for blood will ha&s;ten from the &s;upreme judge, who hath divided the cla&s;&s;es of mankind; and, as it were, &s;eperated from the re&s;t tho&s;e

<P>THESE precious gifts which he hath given, as pledges of his love, are to be led and in&s;tructed by them with a proper authority.</P>
<P>IF the parents experimentally felt the advantages of &s;pi|ritual health in them&s;elves, then would they be concerned that the tender minds of their children &s;hould be properly cultivated with the knowledge of the LORD, and a fearful apprehen&s;ion of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing his &s;upreme commands. They would teach them to look further than mere temporal acqui|&s;itions; even to GOD their Creator. They would bring them up in the nurture and fear of the LORD; in order that their minds might be fill'd from the &s;tore-hou&s;e and magazine of boundle&s;s good, and early enriched with the joys of GOD's &s;al|vation: and <HI>this</HI> would naturally diffu&s;e the greate&s;t &s;atisfac|tion to the parents them&s;elves, to &s;ee their children become the delight and ornaments of human nature, and fitted for a glorious change! <HI>the company of Angels, and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect.</HI> The ties of nature, and the &s;tronger ties of gratitude to him who gave the ble&s;&s;ing, call aloud for teaching the tender minds of your children, to walk in the &s;afe and delightful paths of virtue. With what &s;atisfaction and compo&s;ure of mind will &s;uch parents be enabled to an&s;wer the great GOD, upon his awful examination to this purpo&s;e;
<Q>What have you done with tho&s;e tender &s;heep which I com|mitted to your care in the wilderne&s;s? have you trained them up in &s;afety?</Q>
&mdash;How will &s;uch parents be &s;upported by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done their duty, in that &s;olemn hour!&mdash;They then may truly &s;ay,

blood thro' the various ranks, whether mini&s;ters, elders, heads of families, even throughout the various cla&s;&s;es of mankind.</P>
<P>I WISH all parents and heads of families would continually walk, hand in hand with their children and families, in the path which leadeth to life eternal; daily watching over, and improving their ri&s;ing judgments, with the wi&s;dom which cometh from above; in&s;tructing and encouraging them in the contemplation of divine things! per&s;uading them to believe, as the truth is, that the things of this world are all uncertain, and fading away; that they have everla&s;ting man&s;ions erected for them in the city of their GOD; where (if they fall not &s;hort, or turn not a&s;ide (they will enjoy the company of &s;aints and angels for ever more.</P>
<Q>Are you in health; my brethren and &s;i&s;ters?</Q>
<P>EXERCISE your&s;elves in this your pre&s;ent &s;tate, differently from tho&s;e, who&s;e faculties are bounded within the narrow li|mits of this world; cultivate, continually cultivate, the minds of your offspring: endeavouring to rai&s;e in them a proper comprehen&s;ion of the dignity of their natures, and to fix in them early a &s;teady belief of their <HI>immortality;</HI> which is of the utmo&s;t importance to all!</P>
<P>THE hearts of tho&s;e are un&s;ound, who live in a perpetual attachment to the pride of life, who are contaminated with the love of the world, wherein their chief happine&s;s appears to be placed: how can &s;uch point out the way to the city of GOD? how can they &s;ay to their children,
<Q>Let us retreat from the world, from this &s;cene of corruption: let us with|draw from the cares, the &s;olicitudes of life: let us a&s;cend to our appointed home: let us contemplate the joys of eter|nity: let nothing &s;eparate us from that ble&s;&s;ed hope</Q></P>
<P>HOW can parents thus addre&s;s their children, when they have, perhaps, for a long cour&s;e of years, cea&s;ed to con&s;ider the awful importance of the &s;ubject; and their own minds continue fixed, and tyed down to the fading enjoyments of life Alas! that the folly and vanity of the &s;uperfluous plea|&s;ures of the world &s;hould &s;o entirely engage and engro&s;s the attention of any one immortal individual, as to take up almo&s;t every moment of their precious time!</P>
<P>HENCE, &s;ometimes, parents, in&s;tead of in&s;tructing the minds of their children, have &s;o totally corrupted their own
<PB N="12" REF="010615_0011_0F81B9BA54C2C608">
that they have laid ob&s;tructions in the way to the immortal happine&s;s of their offspring, and, when their children have for a time trod in the ways of religion and virtue, they have been &s;o extremely corrupt them&s;elves, as to oppo&s;e them in their pa&s;&s;age; to ob&s;truct them, with violence, in their way to glory; and thereby aggravated their own guilt beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion; alas! what will their puni&s;hment prove, when con|victed of &s;o great a neglect and violation of their duty? when he that is the judge of quick and dead &s;hall appear in judg|ment, to render to every man according to his works! May all parents, who are negligent in the di&s;charge of their duties, lay it &s;eriou&s;ly to heart.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, may you, my brethren and &s;i&s;ters in a &s;piritual relation, continue in a &s;tate of lively active health&mdash; labouring in the &s;ure ground of hope; that, <HI>when the great &s;hepherd him&s;elf &s;hall appear, you may al&s;o appear with him in glory.</HI> If you &s;o per&s;i&s;t, I cannot but yet hope, that your &s;tedfa&s;t continuance will prove the means of &s;preading &s;pi|ritual health, in an eminent degree. For as, on the one hand, minds infected and vitiated <HI>with the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, or the pride of life,</HI> are very apt to &s;pread the contagion to all that are round about them: &s;o, on the other hand, &s;uch as are re&s;tored by CHRIST, to a &s;tate of &s;piritual health, and by him &s;teadily pre&s;erved in it, often become in&s;trumental in his hand, to diffu&s;e that ble&s;&s;ing; from whence, healthy parents have been frequently ob&s;erved to have healthy children.</P>
<P>I AM convinced that the LORD is at work among&s;t the ri&s;ing generation; many of whom &s;tand convicted in their own minds, of the want of &s;piritual health; and are im|ploring the mercy of the GOD of their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>IN order to your attaining it, let me call upon you again, the pre&s;ent ri&s;ing generation; who&s;e &s;tations in life may be likely to have &s;ome little continuance; be ever &s;tedfa&s;t in the performance of your religious duties, that you may become heirs of the kingdom; and have your portion, with the children of GOD.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems to me of the greate&s;t importance, in relation to the various affairs of life, to form aright the minds of youth; and therefore, I once more entreat every parent pre&s;ent, that

<P>AND here, let me cla&s;s every &s;ingle individual; as every &s;ingle individual is po&s;ting on his way to an eternal &s;tate of exi&s;tence&mdash;and that they may be guided by an infinite wi&s;|dom, is my earne&s;t de&s;ire; and be at la&s;t received into glory! welcom'd thither by their dear redeemer!</P>
<P>IN this city he hath laid his hand upon one, and upon another.

<P><HI>Art thou in health; my brother?</HI> Art thou not only <HI>called from</HI> a &s;tate of <HI>darkne&s;s, into his marvelous light;</HI> but, obedient to the call, enter'd upon the road to eternal glory? Art thou in health; my fellow pilgrim?</P>
<P>A SENSE of the want of that food which CHRIST gives, is at lea&s;t a &s;ymptom of life.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE it may be &s;aid concerning &s;ome among you, as was &s;aid formerly to CHRIST; <HI>Lord, he whom thou love&s;t is &s;ick.</HI> The decay of health in many, has been owing to foul feeding; to their daily feeding upon the &s;pirit, maxims and manners of the world, upon exterior appearances, upon comparative righteou&s;ne&s;s, upon a compari&s;on of their pre|&s;ent, with their former &s;tate; who&s;e minds are relaxed with the love and &s;pirit of vanity.

<P>WE admire, with humble hearts and minds, the awful tran&s;actions of that time, when &s;weat, like drops of blood, ran from the face of the holy JESUS! when, being in an agony, he pray'd more earne&s;tly! when he was betray'd, his &s;acred head crown'd with thorns! his face &s;pit upon! he was mo&s;t ignominiou&s;ly treated, and <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xi. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE> as <HI>a &s;heep before her &s;hearers is dumb,</HI> he complained not!</P>

<P><HI>Lord, let me know mine end!</HI> O that this &s;ound may dwell upon your minds, who are the hope of the next generation! upon whom the weighty tru&s;t and care of the cau&s;e of GOD mu&s;t, in a little time, nece&s;&s;arily devolve; that you may come to the knowledge of the <HI>mea&s;ure of your days.</HI> I think, without violence to the text, you may learn from it that you are de&s;tined for immortality: but the love of worldly things is too apt to engage the attention of that immortal part, the &s;oul; which occa&s;ions, to many, the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ant of their know|ing the great and glorious end for which they were formd, <HI>a little lower than the angels,</HI> and intended to be <HI>crown'd with glory and honour.</HI></P>
<Q>Lord! let me know my end and the mea&s;ure of my days!</Q>
<P>I TREMBLE methinks upon the brink of eternity! and &s;o, with a little proper reflection, you might &s;ay all; the aged, the middle aged, and the youth.&mdash;The end of all things is at hand: flatter not your&s;elves therefore with length of days, and a long pro&s;perity of worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; &s;uffer me to be&s;eech you for the &s;ake of your immortal &s;ouls.</P>
<P><HI>What do I owe to my God?&mdash;What do I not owe him?</HI>&mdash; He hath &s;natch'd me as a brand out of the fire; and I would not, tho' to gain the world, tread back again in the path of folly.</P>
<P>I KNOW it by experience, and therefore I would per&s;uade you, not to turn a&s;ide from the GOD of your &s;alvation; but to acknowledge the infinite debt you owe him, and to pay him daily with obedience, adoration and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>OUR &s;ins have been great, and our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions <HI>never</HI> could have been obliterated, had not CHRIST done it for us; let us therefore no longer dwell upon the <HI>rock</HI> of <HI>pre&s;umption</HI> with <HI>Satan,</HI> who hath been a lyar from the beginning; but let us rather <HI>de&s;cend</HI> into the <HI>valley</HI> of <HI>humility and peace,</HI> and <HI>&s;ettle accounts</HI> with the GOD of our <HI>lives,</HI> from whom I had

aray'd to that degree that my life became a burden to me, and I have wi&s;h'd that I had never been born; but CHRIST, who was a <HI>friend to publicans and &s;inners,</HI> is now become <HI>the rock of my &s;alvation!</HI> he hath cau&s;ed me to tru&s;t in him, and to &s;eek the LORD my GOD The debt I owe is infinite, I de&s;ire ever to acknowledge it with all po&s;&s;ible gratitude; and to do my utmo&s;t towards the di&s;charge of it, while I have my being.</P>
<P>IF there is a &s;oul within the audience of my voice which (upon this awful query) <HI>How much owe&s;t thou unto my Lord?</HI> is ready to apprehend, that it owes too much ever to hope for a di&s;charge, or freedom from the heavy load of debt it has contracted; I have a little to &s;ay to &s;uch, even from my own experience: thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions do not exceed the bounds of his mercy; he &s;till careth for thee, with an inexpre&s;&s;ible fa|therly care and tenderne&s;s. Even when his afflictions are upon thee, they are intended for thy good. <HI>The brui&s;ed reed he will not break, the &s;moaking flax he will not quench.</HI> The more any of you &s;ee your real &s;tate, the more you remember the favours you have received, and feel the burthen of your inju&s;tice and ingratitude; the more readily will he meet the penitent di&s;|po&s;ition of your minds.</P>
<P>I HAVE no manner of doubt but he, <HI>who&s;e work is &s;alva|tion,</HI> who <HI>came into the world</HI> purely and purpo&s;ely <HI>to &s;ave &s;in|ners,</HI> will carry on his own work, and, as you wholly re&s;ign your&s;elves to his forming hand, will purify your hearts, re|concile you to the Father, and make you everla&s;ting in&s;tances and monuments of his infinite mercy. Lift up therefore thy head in hope, whoever art in this humbled penitent &s;tate; for <HI>thy &s;alvation draws nigh.</HI> Thou owe&s;t abundance to thy LORD; and there is an abundance which thou can&s;t never pay: but there is the good <HI>Samaritan,</HI> ever ready to do for thee, as for him, who going from <HI>Jeru&s;alem to Jericho, fell among robbers;</HI> by whom he was wounded; <HI>and</HI> to &s;ay, <HI>take care of him, and I will pay.</HI> There is a glorious &s;ound from the great and good <HI>friend</HI> of <HI>publicans</HI> and <HI>&s;inners;</HI> he is ready to &s;ay to thee who art in this penitent &s;tate before him, <HI>Take thy <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ill and write down fifty.</HI> He will <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> <HI>blot out thy &s;ins as a cloud, and thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions as a thick cloud.</HI></P>

<P>THOU ha&s;t loved us before we loved Thee: thy love, O LORD! hath not been after the manner of men: Thou ha&s;t called us, when we were enemies; and ha&s;t reconciled tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors to thy&s;elf.
