<P>IT is a Pa&s;&s;age Occurring in very Ancient Records; P&s;al. LXXIV. 14. <HI>Thou brake&s;t the Heads of Leviathan in pieces, and gave&s;t him to be meat unto the People inhabiting the Wilder|ne&s;s.</HI> When the People of God Enjoy'd the Satisfaction of &s;eeing a <HI>Pharaoh</HI> taken out of the World, then was that Word ac|compli&s;hed.</P>

The Man to whom Statues were Erected, with the Title of, <HI>The Immortal Man,</HI> upon their Pede&s;tal, is by the &s;troke of <HI>Death</HI> now laid in the Grave.</P>
<P>The King who &s;uffered him&s;elf to be bla&s;phemou&s;ly called, <HI>The Almighty,</HI> is cru&s;hed like a <HI>Worm</HI> under the foot of the <HI>Lord God Omnipotent.</HI></P>
<P>The Tyrant, who about Thirty Years ago boa&s;ted on his Medals, [<HI>O Mighty Man, boa&s;ting in Mi&s;chief!</HI>] That he had brought about the <HI>Conver&s;ion of Twenty Hundred Thou&s;and,</HI> whom he called <HI>Hereticks;</HI> You know by what Unparallel'd <HI>Barbarities;</HI> You know to what Abominable <HI>Idolatries;</HI> &mdash; He is now buried under that Epitaph; <HI>The Man of the Earth &s;hall Op|pre&s;s no more.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly all the Servants of God in the World, will on this Occa&s;ion adore the Hand of the Glorious GOD, <HI>breaking in pie|ces the Head</HI> of a <HI>Leviathan.</HI></P>

<P>An <HI>Entertainment</HI> for the <HI>People Inhabi|ting the Wilderne&s;s,</HI> is to be Con&s;idered on this Occa&s;ion. Our God provides an <HI>En|tertainment</HI> for us. And what can more a|greeably, or more deliciou&s;ly <HI>Entertain</HI> us, than a View of the Wonderful <HI>Shakes,</HI> which the Great God is upon giving to the <HI>Nati|ons,</HI> yea, to <HI>all Nations,</HI> upon &s;uch a Di&s;|pen&s;ation!</P>
<P>Our Prophet <HI>Haggai</HI> under the In&s;pirati|ons of God, animated a di&s;couraged and a dilatory People, to go on with rebuilding the Temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> To this Purpo&s;e, a <HI>Greater Glory</HI> is promi&s;ed for the Second, than had been Enjoy'd by the Former Tem|ple. A <HI>Greater Glory!</HI> Not in regard of a Pompous and Splendid Appearance. Nor do I take the Story that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> gives us,
<PB N="4" REF="001763_0005_0FB7CD8F07DD2730">of what was done by <HI>Herod</HI> the Great, un|to it, for to be much better than a <HI>Romance,</HI> of Incredible &amp; Ill-de&s;igned Exaggerations. But the <HI>Greater Glory,</HI> was to be in the Coming of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> thither; in the Pre|&s;ence and Preaching of the <HI>Son of God Incar|nate</HI> there.</P>
<P>Concerning this <HI>Coming</HI> of our Saviour, we have here Two Things remarked.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t; It was to be <HI>in a little while.</HI> T'was indeed Five hundred Years off. But then, three thou&s;and and five hundred Years had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the Fir&s;t Promi&s;e of it. What remained, was but <HI>a little while,</HI> to what had already pa&s;&s;ed. It is but <HI>a little while</HI> unto Him, with whom a <HI>Thou&s;and Years</HI> is but as <HI>One Day.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; <HI>All Nations</HI> were to be <HI>Sha|ken,</HI> to prepare them for &s;uch a Ble&s;&s;ing. The Fulfilment of the Promi&s;e was to be brought on with very <HI>Shaking</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ati|ons. The <HI>Shake upon all Nations,</HI> is here Metaphorically de&s;cribed, and perhaps al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, by a <HI>Shake</HI> upon the <HI>Heavens,</HI> or the Upper World; and upon the <HI>Earth;</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="001763_0006_0FB7CD90AD426530">both the <HI>Sea</HI> and the <HI>Dry Land,</HI> which be|longs unto the <HI>Earth;</HI> or the Lower World.</P>
<P>This is what we are now to pay Regard unto.</P>
<P><HI>There are Times, wherein the Glorious Lord of Heaven and Earth, will Shake the Nations of the World; yea, Shake both Heaven and Earth in the di&s;turbed Nations.</HI></P>
<P>My <HI>Text</HI> &s;hall be a little more particular|ly Explained, before my <HI>Doctrine</HI> be pro&s;e|cuted.</P>
<P>A King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> comes out again&s;t the <HI>Greeians,</HI> with the bigge&s;t Army that ever was heard of: But be&s;ides his <HI>Army</HI> at Land, his <HI>Navy</HI> at Sea, was horribly defeated. So did the <HI>Lord &s;hake the Earth &amp; the Sea!</HI> After this, <HI>Alexander</HI> the King of <HI>Greein,</HI> does annoy and de&s;troy the <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> and by his Victorious Arms, he made all <HI>the Nations to Shake.</HI> The Succe&s;&s;ors of that Emperour, dividing the Empire, fell out a|mong them&s;elves; E&s;pecially the Kings of the <HI>North</HI> and of the <HI>South;</HI> of <HI>Syria,</HI> that is, and of <HI>Egypt;</HI> who made the <HI>Nations to
<PB N="6" REF="001763_0007_0FB7CD938975C4A8">Shake &s;till</HI> by their Bloody Wars. After this, the <HI>Romans</HI> Invaded and Conquered <HI>Grecia:</HI> And at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ngth <HI>Civil Wars</HI> fell out among the <HI>Romans</HI> them&s;elves; in which Wars there were &s;ome terrible <HI>Sea-fights.</HI> Thus the Lord made the <HI>Sea,</HI> and the <HI>Dry|land,</HI> and <HI>all Nations</HI> to <HI>Shake.</HI> Finally, the <HI>Romans</HI> brought a De&s;olation upon the whole Jewi&s;h State, both Civil and Sacred; wherein the Lord <HI>Shook,</HI> not the <HI>Earth</HI> only, but the <HI>Heavens</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>Our Fir&s;t Enquiry now &s;hall be,</P>
<P><HI>HOW 'tis</HI> that our Glorious LORD, will <HI>Shake the Nations,</HI> yea, <HI>Shake both Heaven &amp; Earth</HI> about them?</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. There are Times wherein <HI>Shakes</HI> are given to the <HI>Corporeal World; Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth</HI> Literally taken, are wonderfully <HI>Shaken,</HI> and unto the Terror of the Nations.</P>
<P>The <HI>God that formed all things,</HI> has put all Things into an incomparable <HI>Order.</HI> But &s;ometimes the World may be put &s;ome|what out of the <HI>Order</HI> wherein tis ordinarily carried on. When the <HI>cour&s;e</HI> of the World is altered, by any <HI>Extraordinary</HI> work or
<PB N="7" REF="001763_0008_0FB7CD95097C15D8">change upon it, then does the Great God give a <HI>Shake</HI> unto it.</P>
<P>Can <HI>Heaven</HI> be <HI>&s;haken?</HI> Yes. Prodigi|ous <HI>Thunderings</HI> and <HI>Lightnings</HI> in <HI>Hea|ven,</HI> are &s;ome <HI>&s;haking</HI> of Heaven. Thus the Lord <HI>&s;hook Heaven,</HI> at the giving of the Law, when the <HI>Thunders</HI> &amp; <HI>Lightenings</HI> were &s;uch as to make <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf cry out, <HI>I exceedingly fear &amp; quake.</HI> Of this we read; P&s;al. LXVIII. 8. <HI>The earth &s;hook, the heavens al&s;o dropped at the pre&s;ence of the Lord.</HI> And &s;o, when the <HI>Stars in their Cour&s;es fight</HI> again&s;t the Enemies of God, by rai&s;ing any De&s;tructive Tempe&s;t upon them; <HI>Heaven</HI> is then <HI>&s;haken</HI> in it and for it. There is al&s;o a <HI>&s;haking</HI> of <HI>Heaven,</HI> when any real Prodigies do there &s;how them&s;elves: for &s;o we may &s;uppo&s;e there &s;ometimes do, without our falling into the whim&s;ies of a fanciful and credulous <HI>Livy</HI> about them. The Learned Man, who wrote again&s;t the Regard of all &s;uch Things, afterwards owned unto one to whom I have the Honour to be related, <HI>That he had overdone.</HI> Tho&s;e Things that are called, <HI>Fearful &s;ights and
<PB N="8" REF="001763_0009_0FB7CD969CE6ED00">great &s;igns from Heaven;</HI> There is a <HI>&s;haking</HI> of Heaven in them. We read, Mat. XXIV. 29. <HI>Stars &s;hall fall from Heaven, &amp; the Powers of the Heavens &s;hall be &s;haken.</HI> When <HI>Blazing Stars,</HI> do in their Elliptic Motions make their De&s;cents towards us, &amp; threaten a Mi&s;|chievous Bru&s;h unto us, then do <HI>Stars fall from Heaven.</HI> But then, mo&s;t properly, then mo&s;t awfully, are the <HI>Powers of the Heavens &s;haken;</HI> when the Angels of the <HI>Heavens</HI> are put upon doing unu&s;ual Things among us. The <HI>Heavenly Powers</HI> may go &s;o far out of the common Road, as to break in upon us, and <HI>Vi&s;ibly,</HI> or <HI>Audibly,</HI> and <HI>Sen&s;ibly</HI> do Strange Things among the Children of Men; There is a wonderful <HI>&s;haking</HI> of <HI>Hea|ven</HI> in &s;uch Things. It <HI>&s;hakes Heaven,</HI> when the <HI>Angels</HI> do come out of <HI>Heaven,</HI> with Ap|paritions, or with Operations, whereat Fle&s;h and Blood falls into a con&s;ternation. <HI>Hea|ven</HI> is then <HI>&s;haken;</HI> when the <HI>Heavenly Ho&s;t</HI> is upon &s;uch <HI>Motions</HI> as cau&s;e ju&s;t A|mazement; and perhaps the <HI>Tongues of Men</HI> become the <HI>Tongues of Angels.</HI> &mdash; It be|comes me to &s;top here; and Step into <HI>Lower Regions.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="001763_0010_0FB7CD9A1EBCC640">
The <HI>Earth</HI> is to be <HI>Shaken</HI> too. 'Tis very particularly &s;o, when what we call an <HI>Earth quake</HI> happens. Our Lord <HI>&s;hakes the Earth,</HI> when He cau&s;es the <HI>Upper layes</HI> thereof to <HI>Quake,</HI> by the Subterraneous Fires getting Head beneath 'em. In an <HI>Earth|quake</HI> there comes to pa&s;s that, whereof we read; Job IX. 6 <HI>He &s;hakes the earth out of her place, &amp; the pillars thereof do tremble.</HI></P>
<P>Thus again the Lord <HI>&s;hook the Earth</HI> at the Giving of the Law; when the <HI>whole Mountain Quaked greatly.</HI> The Songs a|mong the People of God many Ages after, celebrated that <HI>Earth-quake;</HI> They Sang, <HI>O God, The Earth trembled &amp; &s;hook.</HI> Of all the Plagues inflicted by God upon a Pol|luted World, that of an <HI>Earth-quake</HI> is the mo&s;t formidable. It may &s;eem admirable, that it is not Enumerated among the <HI>Plagues</HI> in <HI>Deuteronomy.</HI> Some think, 'Tis becau&s;e the Lord has more peculiarly re&s;erved this <HI>tran&s;cendent Judgment</HI> for the Times and the Crimes under the <HI>New Te&s;tament.</HI> And yet in the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> al&s;o we find it Exem|plified. Very &s;ingularly notable was that
<PB N="10" REF="001763_0011_0FB7CD9B9FB8D1B0">whereof the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> [I &s;ay, the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> becau&s;e I take the Six la&s;t Chapters of what we have in the Book of <HI>Zechariahs</HI> Prophecies, to have been in|deed <HI>Jeremiahs:</HI>] takes notice, in Zech. XIV. 5. <HI>Ye fled from before the Earth-quake, in the Dayes of Uzziah, King of Judah.</HI> The Jewi&s;h Hi&s;torian relates, That this roaring <HI>Earth quake</HI> tore down an High Hill, which rolling for diver&s;e furlongs did no little Da|mage to the Kings Palace and Garden, and the roof of the Temple Split open &s;o that the Sun &s;hone into it. Be &s;ure; The <HI>Earth-quakes</HI> which accompanied the <HI>Crucifixion</HI> and the <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> of our Ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, de&s;erve an Eternal Commemoration: The Modern Travellers, who are far from Fancies and Whim&s;ies, and at the &s;ame time of the mo&s;t un&s;potted Veracity, do on the <HI>Split Rocks</HI> thereabouts at this very day, find a very probable Commemoration of it. 'Tis notorious, That the <HI>Sea,</HI> as well as the <HI>Dry Land,</HI> bears a Part when an <HI>Earth-quake</HI> is in its Agitations. A <HI>Troubled Sea</HI> is then perceived at a di&s;tance from the Shore; and
<PB N="11" REF="001763_0012_0FB7CDA04C7A07E0">near the Shore the <HI>Sea</HI> &s;o retires, that the Channels <HI>of the waters are &s;een,</HI> and what no Eye ever &s;aw before, is <HI>di&s;covered.</HI> When God <HI>&s;hakes the Sea &amp; the dry Land,</HI> the <HI>Sea</HI> withdrawes, and the <HI>Dry Land,</HI> which it once covered, is for a while Expo&s;ed. Every body knows the&s;e Things, I &s;hall &s;ay no more about them.</P>
<P>Secondly. The <HI>Political World;</HI> there are Times wherein <HI>Shakes</HI> are given to <HI>That</HI> al&s;o; The terrified <HI>Nations</HI> feel <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth</HI> if you take them Figuratively, mo&s;t wonderfully <HI>Shaking</HI> about them. God <HI>&s;hakes all Nations;</HI> and He <HI>&s;hakes Heaven and Earth</HI> in doing &s;o. According to the Language of the Orient, by <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> are meant <HI>Superiors</HI> and <HI>Inferiors</HI> among the People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Shaking</HI> of <HI>Heaven,</HI> What is this? Truly, Any Great Alteration in a <HI>Govern|ment</HI> may be counted &s;o. <HI>Kings</HI> are called <HI>Suns. Rulers</HI> under them are called <HI>Stars.</HI> When Suns or Stars are Extingui&s;hed, and put out and pull'd down, and laid in the Du&s;t; when God <HI>Covers the Sun with
<PB N="12" REF="001763_0013_0FB7CDA4C69E07E0">Blackne&s;s, &amp; makes the Stars dark, &amp; brings darkne&s;s upon the Land,</HI> as it was denounced of old unto the Land of <HI>Egypt;</HI> Surely, <HI>Heaven</HI> cannot but be <HI>&s;haken</HI> in it. E&s;peci|ally, when &s;uch &s;urprizing <HI>Mutations</HI> fall out, that Men who are the mo&s;t Faithful <HI>Witne&s;&s;es</HI> of our Saviour, &s;hall <HI>hear a great Voice from Heaven, Come up hither;</HI> and &s;hall put off their <HI>Sackcloth,</HI> and be advanced into Authority, and have power over the <HI>Nati|ons;</HI> the <HI>Heaven</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Nations</HI> mu&s;t be &s;haken with a <HI>Witne&s;s,</HI> in tho&s;e Works of God. A&s;toni&s;hing <HI>Mutations</HI> came upon the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> when a <HI>New Set</HI> of Men, and a <HI>Good Set,</HI> had the management of it thrown into their Hands; And it is thus painted out; Rev.

<P>But the <HI>Church-State</HI> of any <HI>Nations,</HI> or People, is peculiarly the <HI>Heaven</HI> of that Peo|ple. A Settling of <HI>Churches</HI> is called, a Planting of <HI>Heavens.</HI> The <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> of Churches are called, The <HI>Stars</HI> of them.

<PB N="14" REF="001763_0015_0FB7CDAF9180A6E0"><HI>&s;haking of Heaven</HI> over the Heads of the People there.</P>
<P>And may not the <HI>Earth</HI> be <HI>&s;haken</HI> too! It may be &s;o. Then is the <HI>Earth &s;haken,</HI> when there are <HI>great Stirs</HI> among the Common People. Sore Di&s;tre&s;&s;es among a People have this De&s;cription given of them; I&s;a. XXIV. 19, 20. <HI>The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean di&s;&s;olved, the earth is moved exceedingly; The earth reels to &amp; fro like a Drunkard, &amp; is removed like a Cottage.</HI> Tumults, &amp; Ferments and Uproars among a People, are a Shaking of the Earth, as well as the <HI>Roaring of the Sea,</HI> in the Prophetic Schemes of &s;peaking. We Read of &s;uch Things as tho&s;e; Luk. XXI. 25. <HI>Upon the earth di&s;tre&s;s of Nations, with perplexity, the Sea and the Waves roaring.</HI> Sometimes, there are violent <HI>Commotions</HI> among the People.

<P>Thirdly. <HI>Deaths</HI> and <HI>Wars</HI> are Two ve|ry con&s;iderable Strokes, whereby the Great God gives very con&s;iderable <HI>Shakes</HI> unto the Nations.</P>
<P>The Deaths of <HI>Chief Men</HI> give a Shake to the State which tho&s;e Great Men Sup|ported. The Fall of <HI>Pillars</HI> makes the Hou&s;e to <HI>&s;hake,</HI> at the Supports leaving of it. And no <HI>Pillars</HI> do &s;tand &s;o firm, that the Mighty One, before whom every <HI>Samp|&s;on</HI> is le&s;s than a <HI>Moth,</HI> cannot throw them down. The World Shakes, when He throws them down. When a King died, and it was cryed out, <HI>How is the Mighty fallen?</HI> It was then &s;aid, P&s;al. LX. 2. <HI>Thou haft made the Earth to tremble.</HI> Sometimes <HI>One Life</HI> has upon it, Inexpre&s;&s;ible Depen|dencies!
