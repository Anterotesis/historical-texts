<P>HAVING receiv'd the utmo&s;t Satisfac|tion in vi&s;iting your Academy, and exa|mining &s;ome of its higher Cla&s;&s;es, I cou'd not be ea&s;y 'till I had te&s;tify'd that Satisfaction in the mo&s;t public Manner.

A few pri|vate Gentlemen of this City have, in the Space of two or three Years, projected, begun, and carried to &s;urprizing Perfection, a very noble <HI>In|&s;titution;</HI> and an In&s;titution of that Kind too, which, in other Countries, has &s;carce made &s;uch a Figure in the Space of &s;ome Centuries, tho' founded by Kings, and &s;upported at the public Expence.</P>

They are however mode&s;tly hinted, in the fol|lowing Poem, from a Mouth that cannot fail to give them new Importance:</P>
<P>The Performance is far inferior to the Subject; but an Apology will not mend it. As I can have no Time to improve it during my Stay in <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> I beg your Acceptance of it, as it is at pre|&s;ent; together with my Promi&s;e of rendering it more worthy the Subject, when more Lei&s;ure &s;hall enable me &s;o to do.&mdash;</P>
<P>That the Succe&s;s of your Undertaking may &s;till exceed even your own mo&s;t &s;anguine Hopes, is my earne&s;t Prayer; as it is my firm Per&s;ua&s;ion that &s;uch a fair Beginning cannot fail of the mo&s;t la&s;ting good Con&s;equences.</P>
