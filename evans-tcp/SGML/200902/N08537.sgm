<P>I &s;aid it was very odd he &s;hould be &s;o near the coach and not &s;ee it. He &s;aid it was thinking on me. I gave him no an&s;wer, not to my knowledge.

<P>Not to my knowledge. The next day a|bout noon, &s;he came according to her time, and fetched the ruffles, and &s;aid &s;he wanted &s;everal more things, and a&s;ked me, if I could come to her hou&s;e next day at four o'clock; I an&s;wered, I would come if &s;he plea&s;ed.</P>

<P>Nothing particular. The next day, ac|cording

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What day of the month?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>December the 16th, the day of the week was Wedne&s;day. I went to Curtain Row, ju&s;t by Hol|loway mount. The maid opened the door, &s;he went up &s;tairs and let her mi&s;tre&s;s know that I was there, and then I was ordered up &s;tairs; &s;he behaved in a very genteel manner, and a&s;ked me to &s;it down, and then de&s;ired to look at the things which I had brought; &s;he ordered tea directly; I told her I could not &s;tay to drink tea, and begged to be excu&s;ed. Ju&s;t as I was &s;peaking of that, in came a little man like a Jew, and made a great many compliments to this lady, as if he had not &s;een her before that day. I have &s;ince found the name of this man to be J&s;aac J&s;aacs; then they began to talk about his going to the play, &s;he &s;aid &s;he was going into the city to &s;ee a lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did &s;he name what part of the city, or what lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; he &s;aid he mu&s;t have a coach to go to the play, and chat if &s;he would, &s;he might go part of the way in his coach, that he would &s;et her down. Then the turned to me, and &s;aid, this is the lady I told you of; &s;he then &s;aid, &s;he would be glad if I would go along with her; that &s;he wanted a great many things, and would be a good cu&s;tomer to me. I made many excu&s;es, that my dre&s;s was not &s;uitable, and then de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from going that night; &s;he &s;aid, the lady was a very agreeable lady, and would think nothing of my dre&s;s, it was all very well, and begged I would go; then the Jew went with a pretence to fetch a coach; he came back again directly, and hurried away very fa&s;t; we were hurried into the coach, and the maid &s;eemingly, was to bring the candle, but kept back with it. I went into the coach in the dark, and was not able to di&s;cern what fort of a coach it was. When I got into the coach, the Jew drew up the gla&s;&s;es; I ob&s;erved that they were very good gla&s;&s;es for a hackney coach. He &s;aid it was a very good coach indeed. I by and by &s;aid, it was a ve|ry good coachman, as well as a good coach, he drove &s;o fa&s;t, and I did not hear him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the hor&s;es.

He wanted me to play at tetotum: He &s;aid, he &s;uppo&s;ed I could play, and begged I would, I told him, when I was a child po&s;|&s;ibly I might, but now I thought it rather beneath me. He &s;aid, if I would not accept the things we &s;hould play for them; which we did, but I did not accept of them after|wards. I &s;aid &s;everal times, between, to Mrs. Harvey, I &s;hould be glad if &s;he would let me go home. She &s;aid we &s;hould go home pre&s;ently. I told her it grew late, and begged that I might go, for my friends did not know where I was, and would be unea&s;y. She &s;aid I &s;hould go pre&s;ently. The gentleman &s;aid he wanted me to &s;ee the hou&s;e. I told him I did not care to &s;tay to|night; and as the ladies were not there, and I did not &s;ee they would come, I could &s;ee the hou&s;e another time. He &s;aid, may be I would not come another time, I &s;aid, may be I would. He &s;aid, will you promi&s;e me to come another time. I &s;aid I did not chu&s;e to promi&s;e it. I would not pro|mi&s;e, becau&s;e I never intended it, if I could get out; not that that I had, at that time, any thoughts of being kept there; but expecting the per&s;on that courted me, I wanted to be at home. He then &s;aid, Mi&s;s, but you &s;hall &s;ee the hou&s;e to-night, therefore took me in to &s;ee another room or two. When we came into a room where there was a harp&s;icord, he a&s;ked Mrs. Griffinburg whether &s;he was &s;ure all the family were out, becau&s;e if he was &s;ure all the family were out, he would play the mu&s;ic to Mi&s;s.&mdash;This confirmed me that he was a &s;ervant in the hou&s;e; and becau&s;e I thought I heard the Doctor before &s;ay, here comes the &s;teward; and the gentleman having &s;o mean an appearance, I had no notion he was ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e.</P>

<P>As &s;oon as he had &s;aid that, Mrs. Griffing|burg, turned to Mrs. Harvey, and &s;aid, how glad &s;he was they had got &s;o nice an opportunity to have the hou&s;e all to them&s;elves. After he had played the mu&s;ic, and they had &s;taid a little while, I was had out into the room I was fir&s;t in. I intreated of Mrs. Harvey again

Lord Baltimore &s;aid, Mi&s;s, you &s;hall &s;tay to &s;upper fir&s;t. I &s;aid, Sir, I don't choo&s;e any &s;upper, and begged I might go home. He then ordered &s;upper.

I flew into a very great pa&s;&s;ion, &s;truggled, and got from behind the curtain. Mrs. Harvey and Doctor Griffinburg came up &s;eemingly to help him: With that I fought with them all, and &s;aid, I would go home directly, and made up to the door: With that, he &s;aid I &s;hould &s;tay to &s;upper fir&s;t.

He then offered me a gla&s;s of &s;yllabub, which I knocked out of his hand, and got up again, and &s;aid I would go home, and made up to the door. He &s;aid it was late, and &s;aid there could be no coach got for me. I told him not to tell me about a coach, I wanted no coach, and would &s;lay upon no account whatever. I de|fired he would not attempt to per&s;uade me. With that he &s;tood over me (I believe it might be then about eleven but can't exactly &s;ay the time; I think it was about e|leven when they had fir&s;t done &s;upper) he &s;tlood over me till between twelve and one.

<P>Seeing the di&s;tre&s;s I was in, and that I would go home, and I &s;aid how frightened my friends would be, he &s;aid, he would write a letter to my

He flew into a pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;aid I need not trouble my&s;elf about him, for he &s;hould not meddle with me. I told him no, no more he &s;hould. He went away. Then Harvey and Griffinburg, and Dr. Griffinburg, &s;tood over me for a|bout another hour, to per&s;uade me to be reconciled, and go up flairs to bed.

They then a&s;ked me how I could make &s;uch a piece of work; they never heard a per&s;on make &s;uch a crying, or &s;aw &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s in their lives. With that I told them, I thought I had great rea&s;on for it, when I was taken a|way from all that was near and dear to me in the world. I did a&s;&s;ure them, that I would not &s;tay there, and they &s;hould not keep me upon any account; for that I would never yield to his ba&s;e purpo&s;es. With that, Mrs. Har|vey &s;aid, &s;he did not &s;uppo&s;e he wanted to do any thing again&s;t my will. I told her, if he did not, what was the rea&s;on that he kept me there from day to day, and would not let me go home? I told her I would not &s;tay, or yield to his ba&s;e purpo&s;es, if he would give me his hou&s;e full of &s;ilver and gold&mdash;This was up in the room, if I remember right. She &s;aid, &s;he did not &s;uppo&s;e he would do any thing again&s;t my will, or keep me again&s;t my will. I told her, he never would keep me with my will, for it never would be my will to &s;tay there; and that if he would marry me, and &s;ettle all his e&s;tate upon me, I never would have him, for I hated him, and ever &s;hould; and therefore begged he would not keep me in that pri&s;on of hell, for it was a pri&s;on of hell indeed!</P>

<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some time after this, I went down &s;tairs again into the &s;ame room where I was before. He came to me; I was in the very &s;ame di&s;tre&s;s as I was before; it was before breakfa&s;t; and I told him, though he had no compa&s;&s;ion on me&mdash;I a&s;ked him if he had ever been a father; if he had, he might have &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion for my father: if he was a father him&s;elf, &s;urely he mu&s;t con&s;ider my father, what he mu&s;t feel for the lo&s;s of a child that he loved, and could not tell where &s;he was; whether &s;he was dead or alive. I told him, not only &s;o,
<PB N="18" REF="010919_0017_0F85291A95C41908">but that we were engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s, and they could not carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s without me. With that, he &s;aid, he had been more careful in that re&s;pect than I had, for he had &s;ent my father &s;omething, that his bu&s;ine&s;s might not &s;top. I told him, that would be of no u&s;e, for they could make no u&s;e of it till I came. He &s;aid with that, I &s;hould write to my father my&s;elf. I told him, if I did, it would be to no purpo&s;e, for I &s;uppo&s;ed I mu&s;t write ju&s;t what he plea&s;ed; and if he did not like it, he would not &s;end it, let me write whatever I would. He &s;aid, yes he would, and I &s;hould write. I &s;aid, I &s;uppo&s;ed he would &s;tand over me all the time. He &s;aid, no, he would go away; but he left the two women &s;tanding over me; therefore he might as well have &s;tay'd him&s;elf.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Standing clo&s;e to me, to &s;ee how I acted, and take care of me; this was upon Friday, about the middle of the day. I wrote three or four lines, and &s;aid, more than truth, becau&s;e I knew it would come into his hands; and if it did not plea&s;e him, I knew that he would not let it go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Can you tell what you wrote?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;aid that he had u&s;ed me with as much honour as I could expect, and begged they would come immediately. After I had wrote the&s;e two or three lines, the two women &s;aid, he had &s;ent my father two hun|dred pounds the day before, and that I ought to put it in, and know if they had it: that they &s;hould return thanks for it. I told them I would not do any &s;uch thing, for I can'd nothing about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Both jointly, and I refu&s;ed it &s;everal times. After that they went and a&s;ked Lord Baltimore, whether it &s;hould be to or not; he came in and &s;aid he did not care much about it, but I might, if I would, put it in; &s;o I wrote that they told me they had &s;ent two hundred pounds, and I de&s;ired to know if he had it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think your expre&s;&s;ion was, that you put into your letter more than truth; how came you to do that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>For the rea&s;on I &s;aid before; that I knew he would not &s;end it, if I did not &s;ay &s;omething in fa|vour of him. In an hour or two after that, there came up one of the &s;ervants, I forget which, and &s;aid that a
<PB N="19" REF="010919_0018_0F85291CD744DD08">gentleman had brought a letter, which Lord Baltimore brought in, and &s;aid it came from Richard Smith; and that my father had been there, and would not &s;tay till I and he could be &s;ent for. With that I &s;aid, I would not believe any thing of it. I did believe it was his own forging, for it was wrote in another language. He pre|tended to read it to me, but I told h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it was nothing at all, for he could read it as he lik'd. With that he &s;aid he would &s;end for the man, and make me a liar. I &s;aid he could not, but he would make the man &s;ay as he plea&s;ed, and could talk to him in another language. The man was brought. I told him if he would let me a&s;k the man que&s;tions, then I would believe, if he gave me &s;atisfactory an&s;wers. He &s;aid I could confound the whole world; I told him I did not know but I might, if they did not &s;peak truth. The man came in and &s;at down, and he &s;poke to him &s;omething fir&s;t in another language; it was not Engli&s;h I know; and then &s;aid, did not you bring this letter? he an&s;wered, Yes. I told him I did not believe he did; the more, becau&s;e he had been talking to him in another language. I a&s;ked him what &s;ort of a man it was came to him. He &s;aid a mid|dling man. I a&s;ked him what he called a middling man; he &s;aid a tali&s;h man. I a&s;ked whether he was old or young, and what &s;ort of a face he had, but he could give me no &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to any thing I &s;aid. I then &s;aid to Lord Baltimore, who is a liar now, you or me? I &s;aid they were a parcel of popi&s;h, rubbi&s;hing peo|ple, and I would not believe any thing they &s;aid to me, (for I thought Lord Baltimore had been a French man and a Papi&s;t.)</P>

<P>Can you give any rea&s;on?</P>

<P>What time was this?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>He pa&s;&s;ed for Richard Smith. My Lord Baltimore played upon the mu&s;ick, Richard Smith and
<PB N="20" REF="010919_0019_0F85291D96A1B768">Mrs. Harvey danced, and I walked about the room in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.

They &s;aid no, and took me to another picture of a &s;hip in a &s;torm, and told me that was my picture. Then they led me back into the room again. They all &s;at down before the &s;ire, and I &s;at down with them. He &s;aid to this Richard Smith, as &s;oon as he had &s;at down, he &s;hould draw Mi&s;s's picture. I &s;aid he &s;hould do no &s;uch thing; I &s;hould not think of having my picture drawn. He drew my picture in the po&s;ture I &s;at crying, in this manner <STAGE>(<HI>de&s;cribing it, with her head leaning upon her hand;</HI>)</STAGE> they did not put the tears into the picture.</P>

<P>What pa&s;&s;ed that night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing more particular. About twelve at night it was pretended that the little Jew man that fir&s;t took me away, was &s;ent with that letter that I wrote. Broughton came in, who was called the &s;tewart, (that is one that an&s;wered to that name) and brought word that my father had &s;topt the Jew. Lord Baltimore was in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;wore he would go and pull my fa|ther by the no&s;e. I de&s;ired he would give me leave to &s;peak a word or two: that I was very &s;ure my father had done no &s;uch thing, for he had not &s;pirit enough for it. While I was &s;peaking, in came the other man, the Jew that I had &s;een at fir&s;t, I&s;aacs; he brought a let|ter, which he &s;aid he had brought from my friends; and told me they were all well &s;atisfied and plea&s;ed, and &s;o put the letter into my hands. It was wrote by my &s;i&s;|ter, and my &s;i&s;ter writing &s;o &s;eldom, I did not know her hand at fir&s;t; but turning the other &s;ide of the letter, I found the &s;eal to be the young man's that courted me, Mr. Davis, which cou&s;irmed me it was come from them, which was the fir&s;t word I knew that came from them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The purport of the letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was, as near as I can remember, this: Only plea&s;e to appoint a place when and where we may meet you. It was directed to me if I remember right. This was about twelve at night: time was come that I mu&s;t go up &s;tairs, which I would not do till he had pro|mi&s;ed me he would not meddle with me, nor come near me. I went up &s;tairs to the &s;ame room where I went before, and Mrs. Harvey and Mrs. Griffinburg came up to the &s;ame room, and pre&s;&s;ed me very much to go to bed. I &s;till cried, and &s;aid I would not; but finding
<PB N="21" REF="010919_0020_0F85291E570478A8">my &s;trength was gone, I &s;aid, may be I will lie down &s;ometime in the night in my cloaths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Had you eat any thing at that time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>To my knowledge I had neither eat no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> drank. Upon my &s;aying that, Mrs. Griffinburg went out of the room, and left only me and Mrs. Harvey. I fancy that was between one and two, but I cannot &s;ay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you lie down in the middle of the night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I lay down in about half an hour after Mrs. Griffinburg was gone; and &s;he coming up about half an hour after frightened me, for I thought it was Lord Baltimore coming up, which &s;et me in &s;uch a tremble, that I was obliged to get up; then I walked a|bout, and &s;o laid down again, and &s;o I went on all the night in great di&s;tre&s;s: then I talked to Mrs. Harvey, and a&s;ked her if &s;he had ever been in love: I think &s;he &s;aid yes, I am not po&s;itive: with that I told her, then I was engaged; that a young man kept me company, and we were about &s;ettling; that he had a great regard for me, and that I could not &s;ay but I had the &s;ame for him, and therefore begged her to think how hard it mu&s;t be in my ca&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That part of the &s;tory was true, was it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. I told her how I had been brought up from a child in a very religious way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That part of the &s;tory is true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and that I could not bear any of their ways; and that if Lord Baltimore would &s;ettle all his e&s;tate on me I would not comply, and a great deal of &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e, which I can't now recollect; but begged that &s;he would lay it before my Lord, and intreat him to let me go; for I thought, if &s;he would lay the ca&s;e before him, and tell him how it was, he would let me go. I &s;aid, I dare &s;ay, if &s;he had a mind, &s;he could let me go her&s;elf. She &s;aid, no; tho' &s;he had known the hou&s;e &s;o long, &s;he did not know the way out of the hou&s;e. With my crying, and being in &s;uch an agony and di|&s;tre&s;s, &s;he got up &s;ooner than common, and we went down &s;tairs; but when we came to the bottom of the &s;tairs every door was locked, and we could get no fur|ther; we were therefore forced to go up &s;tairs, and were upwards of an hour before we could get into the room, where there was a &s;ire below &s;tairs, where we were before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did Mrs. Harvey try to get out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcoock.</SPEAKER>
<P>She did, but could not. She did not try
<PB N="22" REF="010919_0021_0F85291F16FDECE0">to get out of the hou&s;e, but only into the room where the fire was down &s;tairs.</P>

<P>What was done in con&s;equence of this de&s;ire of your's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>When we came down &s;tairs &s;he did go out from me, but Mrs. Griffinburg was pre&s;ent: they did not leave me alone not one five minutes together, I be|lieve. Lord Baltimore came in &s;oon after. I was in great di&s;tre&s;s, as u&s;ual. They had &s;ome breakfa&s;t.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Harvey and Mrs. Griffinburg. Lord Baltimore was pre&s;ent, if I remember right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did he &s;ay any thing to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did, but I cannot exactly remember what.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>What time did Lord Baltimore come?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think about eight or nine o'clock. I pleaded the &s;ame arguments with him as I had done with Harvey, and told him about this &s;ame young man. With that he flew into a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and called me all the hitches and whores he could think of, and throwed the news-paper at me; and told me, if I offered to tell him any thing more about another man, he would fling me out of the window, or tie my petticoats about my head, and &s;end me home in a wheelbarrow. The little Jew was pre&s;ent, Mrs. Harvey and Mrs. Griffinburg, and he &s;aid to the Jew, carry the &s;lut to a mean hou&s;e, like her|&s;elf. With that I was terrified very much, and thought he meant a bawdy-hou&s;e. He flew out of the room in a great pa&s;tion, and left the little Jew, Harvey and Grif|finburg. They per&s;uaded me to be reconciled. They &s;aid, had he not promi&s;ed he would &s;end for my father, and make &s;uch propo&s;als as he would like; and if I did not like them, I &s;hould go home again, and had I not better leave it to him. With that the little Jew came and told me, that all my friends, and Mr. Davis in par|ticular, were well plea&s;ed. I told him I was &s;ure it was a very great &s;tory, therefore begged he would not &s;ay a|nother word about it; but with their per&s;ua&s;ions, and fearing he would &s;end me to a bawdy-hou&s;e, I de&s;ired Lord Baltimore might be called in. He came in. I told him, if my father came, and terms were offered him, I would con&s;ider them, and begged that God would direct me. This was on Saturday about noon: after this I was very ill, and could hold up my head no longer.</P>

<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; only a di&s;h of tea that morning. With that he came to me, and told me, by that means I put it out of my power to help my&s;elf in that which I was &s;o afraid of; and then he went and mixed a draught and brought it me, and &s;aid, I mu&s;t take it. I refu&s;ed it, &s;earing there might be &s;omething hurtful in it. He &s;aid there was nothing hurtful in it, and I mu&s;t take it. I did. This was about two or three o'clock.</P>

<SP>

<P>This was Sunday morning about nine or ten o'clock. Lord Baltimore came in to me, and a&s;ked me how I did, (this was after I had breakfa&s;ted) and a&s;ked me if he had not kept his promi&s;e. He a&s;ked me if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad any whey. I told him no, I had a little red wine. He was very angry with the hou&s;ekeeper, and &s;aid that I
<PB N="24" REF="010919_0023_0F852921DF4E01F0">mu&s;t take another draught, for it was enough to kill me. With that he mixed up another draught, and in&s;i&s;ted u|pon it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I &s;hould take it, which I refu&s;ed, fearing there &s;hould be &s;omething hurtful; but I did take it.

<P>As u&s;ual I was crying in the &s;ame man|ner. In the afternoon he came in to me, and de&s;ired I would compo&s;e my&s;elf, and &s;it down and talk to him a little. With that he began to ridicule religion, and to &s;ay that all things came by nature; and that man, when be died, went to the du&s;t: that he thought they had no living &s;ouls: and he &s;aid that, as a philo&s;opher, he believ|ed there was neither God nor devil, heaven nor hell. I de&s;ired they would bring me a bible, and I would prove to him that there was all. With that the bible was brought, and I proved to him from the word as much as was in my power, that there was a God, a devil, heaven and hell: and after that I concluded my di&s;cour&s;e, which was from two or three in the afternoon till nine at night, with very little intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>Did you dine with them?</P>

<P>I believe that day I might eat a bit; I am not &s;ure. I told him my rea&s;on of having &s;o long a di&s;|cour&s;e, and being &s;o plain with him, was to convince him of the difference there was between him and me; and that he might be a&s;&s;ured it was impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould comply, and that I would not &s;tay upon any account whatever, and therefore begged he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> me go home. After &s;upper they all went out of the room; that is, Dr. Griffinburg, Mrs. Harvey, and Mrs. Griffin|burg, went out, and left him and me alone. Then he began to &s;how indecencies: he fir&s;t pulled me into his lap. This was about nine o'clock on Sunday night, and wanted to put his hand in my bo&s;om, which I would not let him, and got out of his arms. Then I was &s;et down in the other chair, he began to open his breeches again, and &s;trove to pull my hand to him. I &s;truggled and got away, and got up; then he pre&s;&s;ed me to one corner of the room, and there pre&s;&s;ed me up again&s;t the wain&s;cot, as if he would pre&s;s me to death. I &s;truggled and got from him; then he got me down in an elbow chair; he opened his breeches, and &s;trove to pull my petticoats up.
<PB N="25" REF="010919_0024_0F85292263C856E0">I &s;truggled, and cried out all I could, and begged and pleaded with him that he would take my life, for I would never yield the other to any one, but upon ho|nourable terms, which was marriage. He then got up and walked about the room awhile, and then &s;et me down, and &s;erved me in the &s;ame manner, but did not compleat his ba&s;e purpo&s;e at that time. This, I believe was near two hours. I &s;truggled and cried all I could. Then he called in Mrs. Harvey, and &s;aid we mu&s;t go up to bed; and he &s;aid he would lead me up &s;tairs, which terrified me greatly. I did not know what I &s;hould do with my&s;elf, lea&s;t he &s;hould fling me upon the bed when he got me up &s;tairs. Mrs. Harvey made an ex|cu&s;e: &s;he &s;aid &s;he had forgot &s;omething, and mu&s;t go down again. I was afraid they had juggled it between them, and begged and pleaded he would not meddle with me. He began as before to open his breeches, and &s;trove to pull up my petticoats. Soon after Mrs. Harvey came into the room again, and he told me, if I did not undre&s;s my&s;elf that night, and go into bed, he would force me to go into bed with him. He went away; and I went to bed with Mrs. Harvey. This was on Sunday night. All this night I had no re&s;t: I did not go to &s;leep any part of the night, as I know of. I &s;tarted up and cryed, O, he is coming! he is coming! with that I again pleaded with Mrs. Harvey, to per&s;uade him to let me go home. I met with no &s;ucce&s;s, as &s;he was ju&s;t as relentle&s;s as ever. This was on Monday morning. When I came down &s;tairs I was in the &s;ame manner. I went on crying as u&s;ual, praying that I might go home, or &s;ee my friends.</P>

<P>I cea&s;ed very little indeed, by and by he came to me and &s;aid, if I would go and have my face wa&s;hed, and another cap on, and clean things, and leave crying, I &s;hould &s;ee my father; but if I would not I &s;hould never &s;ee him; for what could my father think to &s;ee me in that dirty condition, and my eyes &s;o bad with crying. I had had no change of linen. I went up &s;tairs with that view. He &s;aid, if I would go up he would &s;end for my father, and I &s;hould &s;ee him. He then &s;aid, now you &s;hall &s;ee your father to day. I had put on &s;ome linen, with my own gown and petticoats.</P>

I told him that would be no plea&s;ure to me. If he would carry me to &s;ee my father, that would be a plea&s;ure to me. With that he &s;aid I &s;hould go and take an airing, and &s;ee my father when I came back. Soon after this they brought word the coach was ready, and that I ma&s;t go. He led me down &s;tairs, into the coach. It was in the yard at the door.</P>

<P>Had any body hold of you?</P>

<P>Perhaps this occa&s;ioned the coach to &s;top?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>It did not cau&s;e the lea&s;t &s;toppage. They went through the &s;treets over We&s;tmin&s;ter-bridge. They had like to have been overturned, they went with &s;uch violence. They had like to have been overturned within three or four doors of the hou&s;e. As near as I can recollect, this was about two o'clock. When we came to We&s;tmin&s;ter-bridge, or before, I can't ju&s;tly &s;ay, I &s;aid, I hoped he was not going to carry me far, that he was not going abroad. He &s;aid no, he was only taking an airing to divert me, and that he &s;hould come back again to dinner. When we came &s;ome way farther, and I &s;aw the four and five mile &s;tones, I &s;aid I hoped he was not going to carry me abroad. He &s;aid, yes, to be &s;ure, he was going to carry me to Spain, to &s;ee the Spaniards. We put on. I a&s;ked him again, and he &s;aid the &s;ame. When we got to Ep&s;om, he &s;aid, now we are come to Spain, and the&s;e are the Spaniards. There were two or three men in the &s;treets.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, that I can recollect, particu|larly. After dinner Mrs. Griffinburg, Dr. Griffinburg, and Mrs. Harvey, went out of the room. He then took me behind the window-curtain, and began to &s;hew the &s;ame indecencies as before. I pleaded much with him, and &s;truggled all I could, and begged and prayed that he would take my life away. I told him I would give that up freely, but never would the other. With that, he &s;aid it mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o that night, whether I would or no. Then they came in again. They took me out of that room into &s;ome other rooms, to &s;ee the hou&s;e. I told them I thought it was the wor&s;t &s;ight I ever &s;aw. They then told me it mu&s;t be &s;o that night: Mrs. Harvey and Mrs. Griffinburg, told me &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did they explain particulars?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. I was in great di&s;tre&s;s, and cried very much. After this they came in again, and I drank tea with them. Nothing particular pa&s;&s;ed at tea. After tea they went up &s;tairs again. Lord Baltimore &s;aid, they mu&s;t do &s;omething to divert them&s;elves; that they would play at blindman's buff, and I &s;hould play with them. I &s;aid I could not play at blindman's buff, I would do no &s;uch thing. He &s;aid I &s;hould not always &s;it in that manner. I was crying, and he &s;wang me round the room, and &s;aid I &s;hould play with them. One of the women was blinded, and one of them pretended &s;he had catched me; with that I &s;aid po&s;itively I would not be blinded. I &s;at down and cryed again. As &s;oon as he &s;aw that, he came and &s;et down by me, and &s;trove
<PB N="28" REF="010919_0027_0F852929230C4A40">to make me look at him. Nothing would make me forget my trouble. I &s;till kept crying, and pleading with God, that he would take me out of time into eternity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you &s;peak loud?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know whether they heard me or no. After this they went to &s;upper, but before they went to &s;upper the two women and he him&s;elf all joined together and &s;aid, I might as well do it quietly, for it mu&s;t be &s;o that night. This was &s;ome time before &s;upper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did any thing particular pa&s;s at &s;upper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. I eat a little bit, but drank no|thing, for fear they had put &s;omething it it. After &s;up|per he ordered them to go to bed; with that they led me out of the room. I was crying. They led me into the bedchamber. The two women began to undre&s;s me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>

<P>Both of them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you oppo&s;e their undre&s;&s;ing of you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was in &s;uch a tremble and fright, that I had no &s;trength left; therefore I was not able to re&s;i&s;t them, but cryed, and begged, and pleaded, that God would take away my life, and pre&s;erve me from that wicked creature. Dr. Griffinburg &s;aid (he was by then, I did not know it till he &s;poke) he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, O, my dear Mi&s;s Sally, don't cry &s;o, don't take on &s;o, it will be all well by and by. Mrs. Harvey &s;aid &s;he never &s;aw any one make &s;uch a piece of work in her life: if I was going to be killed I could not do more. I told her I had much rather be killed. I cryed and took on in a very &s;hock|ing manner, and pleaded much with God to take me out of time into eternity. Then they led me out of that room into the next, and &s;et me down in the elbow chair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Were your cloaths pulled off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>My cap was pulled off, but the re&s;t were only unpinned, and &s;uch like; with that they &s;et me down and pulled all the re&s;t of my things off, and put me into the bed. When the curtains were open I &s;aw that Lord Baltimore was in bed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When you &s;aw that, you &s;ay you was &s;o terrified, and in &s;uch a fright, that you was not able to make re&s;i&s;tance. Did you go into the bed with your own accord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, they had forced me a-top of the
<PB N="29" REF="010919_0028_0F852929D3FA49D0">bed: they drew the curtains, and tucked me up, and went away, as I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What happened after this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>He turned upon me with all the force he could, and forced him&s;elf between me, and &s;aid he would get into me; with that he lay upon me all the weight he could, and &s;trove to pu&s;h him&s;elf into me with all his might; and I cried and &s;truggled all I could, but he held my mouth together with his fingers, that I might not cry; and &s;trove to lie over me, &s;o much as to &s;mother me. When he had been &s;ometime in me, I felt &s;omething come from him; and then he turned off from me as he came on, and left me to live or die as I could. He &s;aid nothing to me all night. I laid in &s;uch a fright and &s;uch a tremble, for fear he &s;hould come to me again, I &s;weat that the drops ran off from me. In the morning he turned upon me in the &s;ame manner, and u&s;ed me in the &s;ame manner. I cried out as I had done before, and made all the &s;tuggle I could. He &s;aid he never heard &s;uch a noi&s;e in his life; I &s;hould rai&s;e the whole hou&s;e. After this he a&s;ked me if I wanted the pot? I &s;aid, yes. I got out of bed, I don't know how, and there came a great quantity of blood from me. I &s;trove to get on my things, and to get away, I was &s;o a|fraid for fear he &s;hould pull me in again, that I got a few of my things on in a loo&s;e manner; and he &s;aid I could not get out, but mu&s;t &s;tay till he let me out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Before we a&s;k you any other que&s;tions, was you at either of the&s;e times at all con&s;enting to what he did?</P>

<P>No, not in the lea&s;t, I made all the &s;trug|gle both times that I could.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you cry out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When you was let out of the bed chamber, in|to what room did you go?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcok.</SPEAKER>
<P>Into the next room, where Mrs. Harvey was, I was not dre&s;t. I &s;at down and cried. Mrs. Har|vey got up. I began to tell her of the u&s;age I had had, but not particulars. She &s;aid, yes, you made noi&s;e enough, I heard you. I &s;aid, well I might. She &s;aid you will like it well enough by and by. I told her no, I &s;hould ever hate e|every thing of the kind; if that was to be my life, it would be a burthen indeed; but I hoped I &s;hould not live long. Finding &s;he an&s;wered me in a rough manner, I thought with my&s;elf, that I had lo&s;t every thing that was dear to
<PB N="30" REF="010919_0029_0F85292BC8D84C28">me, but my life, how &s;hould I do to &s;ave that? With this I re&s;olved, to alter my carriage, and do every thing they de&s;ired that was immaterial, for the&s;e three rea&s;ons&mdash; That I might not be u&s;ed ill;&mdash;that I might not be &s;ent abroad;&mdash;and that I might have &s;ome opportunity of re|turning to London again, which was the only hope I had. By &s;tanding at the windows, I thought that &s;ome time or other I might &s;ee my friends. With this I re&s;olved to alter my carriage, as much as po&s;&s;ible, and do every thing they de&s;ired that was immaterial.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then you declare this was a re&s;olution took at that time, and for the&s;e rea&s;ons?</P>

<P>I am po&s;itive of it as I &s;tand here, taken at that time indeed.</P>

<P>What do you mean by immaterial things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any things that were innocent. As to di|ver&s;ious, I was bred up not to take any, and therefore was re&s;olved not to comply with playing at cards, or dancing, or mu&s;ic, or any thing of that kind.</P>

<P>One of them was, the other came after|wards.
<PB N="31" REF="010919_0030_0F85292BE8E1ED58">I took no notice, nor he neither, no farther than this; my Lord &s;aid I was not wen, and I mu&s;t take a powder, (this was before breakfa&s;t, before I had eat any). While we were at breakfa&s;t, he &s;aid to Mrs. Harvey, Mi&s;s wants &s;omething, does &s;he not? She &s;aid, yes, Sir, &s;he wants &s;ome clean linen. He &s;aid, you &s;hall go to Ep&s;om and buy Mi&s;s &s;ome mu&s;lin for aprons, and things, and &s;he &s;hall work, and that will divert her mind from &s;itting and thinking. While Mrs. Harvey was gone, he &s;aid I &s;hould go and take an airing in a boat. This was Tue&s;|day morning. I told him I had never been upon water, and &s;o was afraid. I had never been upon the water, but only cro&s;&s;ed our little river at Cambridge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you go?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Where?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I went out of the hou&s;e. He &s;aid I mu&s;t run, for &s;ear I &s;hould get cold. I did. When I came to the canal, I was all in a tremble, and did not know how to go in, for I was afraid. When I came in, the bottom of the boat was very full of water. I thought that was a very unfit place. I thought it would have killed me, but I thought I was as willing to die as live, therefore I would go. When I was upon the water, he &s;aid it would &s;it me for going abroad: this increa&s;ed my fears that I had had before. Then, if I remember right, Mrs. Griffinburg &s;aid we will take a walk in the park. I then &s;aid, if we did, I &s;hould be glad to go to &s;uch a place, becau&s;e I fancied there was a foot-path and a gate that way to go out of the park, becau&s;e the way they brought me had no foot-path near it; therefore I thought, if I could any ways e&s;cape, I could not go that way, &s;o wanted to &s;ee if this other gate would lead me out; but whether &s;he came at my thoughts or not, I cannot tell, but we did not go a &s;ixth part of the way, I believe.&mdash; Then we came in again, and Mrs. Harvey, &s;ome time after this, came home, and brought a hat, and &s;ome white ribbons to put on the hat, and &s;ome pink ribbon, which &s;he &s;aid &s;he had bought for a night ribbon. With that Lord Baltimore &s;aid he liked the pink ribbon be&s;t upon the hat. With that I &s;aid, if he liked that be&s;t I would put it on, for the &s;ame rea&s;on as before, that I &s;aid I would do any thing in my power that was imma|terial; &s;o I put on the pink ribbon. When we went up &s;tairs again, &s;he &s;aid &s;he would have the white ribbons
<PB N="32" REF="010919_0031_0F85292C9B7079A0">tied up for favours for a wedding. I &s;aid I &s;hould not think of &s;uch a thing as a wedding, indeed. She in&s;i&s;t|ed upon it. She made up one for her&s;elf, and made a|nother and fixed it to my brea&s;t, but whether &s;he pinned it I do not know. Then we came down again, and &s;he &s;aid to Mrs. Griffinburg, how fine we were, and that &s;he &s;hould have one too; therefore when I came back they made me tie up one for her. At night he brought me the Spectator to read, which, when I found &s;omething &s;erious in it, he came and took it away, and gave &s;ome of Dr. Swift's works, which was very fooli&s;h and ab&s;urd, that I would not read it: I &s;aid it was non&s;en&s;e and &s;tuff. That was all I remember that night. He did not de&s;ire me to go to bed to him that night. I went to bed to Mrs. Harvey.</P>

There was a|nother circum&s;tance which I believe I forgot, that was this: He (Lord Baltimore) &s;aid one day, (I believe on Friday) that if he was to be &s;o &s;ooli&s;h as to let me go ac|cording to my fooli&s;h defire, did I think my friends would take me in? I told him yes, I knew my friends knew me very well, and would take me in; but if they would not, that &s;hould be no excu&s;e to him, for I would beg my bread from door to door rather than &s;tay there. He &s;aid I &s;hould go and expo&s;e him finely indeed. I told him if he would let me go then I would not. He a&s;ked me if I would promi&s;e him? I &s;aid I would. He a&s;ked me, if I would take an oath? I &s;aid I would, upon the Bible, and I would keep it. For this rea&s;on I did not im|portune Mrs Harvey, becau&s;e I knew &s;he would not let me go; for as I knew he was afraid I &s;hould expo&s;e him before, I knew he might be afraid I &s;hould expo&s;e him now. Afterwards, I only importuned every day that I might go to London again to &s;ee my friends. I impor|tuned Dr. Griffinburg, and all of them, as they were pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>We took an airing again in the clo&s;e boat on the water in the evening of that day. Ju&s;t at tea|time there came in two gentlemen and a lady that had been &s;ent for from London, as I under&s;tood. After they had drank tea, he called for a &s;heet, which &s;urpri&s;ed me a good deal, and I was afraid they were going to play
<PB N="33" REF="010919_0032_0F85292D70C94DB8">at &s;ome mi&s;chief, but I found &s;ome time after that they were going to act the magie lanthorn. While they were acting the magic lanthorn, they hung up &s;everal &s;heets acro&s;s the room, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> went and danced behind it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>But while they were acting this, the lady that came down from London &s;aid, that is Lord Balti|more that is acting the old man. There was a per&s;on acting the part of an old man. With that I was glad to hear the name, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had never heard it before; and thonght if I could now get to London and get a pen and ink, I would write a letter and throw it out of the window.</P>
</SP>

<P>Till that time you did not know the per|&s;on that had done you this mi&s;chief was Lord Balti|more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I did not. Next morning, which was Thur&s;day, I intreated Dr. Griffinburg that he would a&s;k my Lord to let us go to London again. He &s;aid he would. He went, and came &s;ome time after to me, and told me we were to go home that day; but I was not &s;atisfied till I &s;aw the coach that we were to go to London in. That day, the women went out into the park, and want|ed to run, and defired me to run along with them, which I did a little way; but I &s;trove to drop them, which they did not let me, but came up with me.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing particular, only I was fearful I &s;hould be obliged to go to bed to him, and was very much terrified. We went up the back way into the &s;ame room we was at fir&s;t; then Mrs. Harvey &s;aid I mu&s;t go to bed to Lord Baltimore. I &s;aid I would not do any &s;uch thing. She &s;aid I mu&s;t go, to be &s;ure; had not I been before? I &s;aid I would do no &s;uch thing. I then made another excu&s;e apphcable to my &s;ex, and de&s;ired that &s;he would go and beg me off, but &s;he would not go, there|fore I went my&s;elf rather than go to bed. I went to him
<PB N="34" REF="010919_0033_0F85292E23F1A518">and told him, and he gave me leave to go to bed el&s;e|where. I lay that night along with Mrs. Harvey.</P>

<P>The next day was Friday, what palled then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was very dull as u&s;ual. I dont know whether I cried or no, but was very dull. By and by, towards noon, I believe, he &s;aid he would introduce me to the other part of the family; and then he told me, if I would be quiet a few days longer, and make my&s;elf &s;atisfied and ea&s;y, and not tell any of the family what had paffed between him and me, I &s;hould &s;ee my father, and if I liked to live with my father be&s;t, we &s;hould have a hou&s;e and live together. He had put &s;ome money in|to my hand, and told me, after I had &s;een my father I &s;hould go where I plea&s;ed, do as I liked lay out the mo|ney as I cho&s;e, and if I liked to go to meeting I &s;hould go. He ordered my hat and cloak to be brought down, and then he went in and fetched a woman which they call Madam Saunier, or &s;ome &s;uch name, and told her that there was a lady come to be a companion to the young ladies. He told her I was a very religious lady, and &s;omething of that kind. She &s;aid &s;he would take care of me.</P>

<P>Who is that?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is governe&s;s to the young ladies. Then he introduced me into the family, and told them I was recommended by my father as a companion to the young ladies, and then went out. This was a part of the hou&s;e I had not been in, except the fir&s;t night, when I believe they &s;hewed it me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You had a &s;air opportunity now of telling Madam Saunier of the injury you had received.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>He had laid the &s;tricte&s;t injunctions upon me; and I thought as they were his &s;ervants they would be as the re&s;t had been; therefore I thought it was be&s;t to keep it to my&s;elf.</P>

<PB N="35" REF="010919_0034_0F85292ED9002580">up &s;tairs to bed, he &s;ent Mrs. Griffinburg to fetch me in. As &s;oon as I went into the room I bur&s;t into tears. This was on Friday night. He was in bed. She want into the room, but did not &s;tay. He a&s;ked me to come to bed: I told him no, I would not. He a&s;&s;ured me if I would come to bed he would not meddle with me, he would only lie by my &s;ide. I told him I would not, over and over; at la&s;t he in&s;i&s;ted upon it that I &s;hould come; and knowing chey would ute force if I did not do it, I went into bed. As &s;oon as I had got into bed he jumped out of bed and &s;etched the candle; and when he had done &s;o, he &s;trove to tear up my &s;hift to &s;ee my nakedne&s;s; I &s;truggled with all my might, and would not let him get a full fight: I cried out, and &s;truggled all I could. With that, he expo&s;ed him&s;elf in the &s;ame manner, and wanted me to look at him; but I would not. After that he went and &s;et the candle down again, and then he came and &s;trove to do the &s;ame things again.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you con&s;ent that night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; not at all. I &s;traggled all I could a|gain&s;t it. He could not do what he intended, by rea&s;on of my then &s;ituation. He did not meddle with me any more, only pulled my hand to him; I told him I thought it was impoffible that any creature could take plea&s;ure in &s;uch vile abominations: there was nothing more par|ticular that night, that I know of. On Saturday morn|ing he got up, and &s;ent Mrs. Griffinburg in to take me up When &s;he came in I was very i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: &s;he de&s;ired I would not &s;tay to dre&s;s my&s;elf there, but &s;aid I mu&s;t go into a|nother room, and had me into another room which I had not &s;een before, where there was a bed. When I was got there, &s;he &s;eeing the condition I was in, a&s;ked me if I would go to bed again: I told her no; but finding I could not &s;tand it, I told her yes, I would. I went to bed, and laid about two hours; but they came &s;o often to me, that I could not get any &s;leep. They came and took me up: they &s;ent the maid in to drets me.</P>

<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. Then there came a woman to take mea&s;ure of me for a gown. Ju&s;t after that Mrs. Griffin|burg came in, and &s;aid my Lord wanted me in his room. I went in. He a&s;ked me what I would have for a gown? I &s;aid I don't care any thing about it; I would as lief wear what I have. He &s;aid, would I have blue? I told
<PB N="36" REF="010919_0035_0F85292F9BEAD1F0">him it might be blue if it would, I did not care. He &s;aw &s;ome brui&s;es upon my hand, as he &s;tood at the window, upon my hand and arm both, and a&s;ked how they came; I told him he did it the fir&s;t night, and that he had made it wor&s;e again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was that true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was &s;trictly true. I went into that room where I was at fir&s;t, and they brought me up &s;ome gauz|es and petticoats, and &s;aid I mu&s;t chu&s;e &s;ome; but he had fixed upon the colour of the petticoat him&s;elf; and as for the gauzes, I told her I did not care, &s;he might take which &s;he plea&s;ed. I took the petticoat.</P>

<P>I think I did, but am not &s;ure. I &s;aid I was &s;o ill I could not work there. She de&s;ired I would tell her what I wanted more; I &s;at down &s;omething a|bout wires, but I don't know what. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid left the pen and ink, but came back again in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>S Woodcock</SPEAKER>
<P>No. Mrs. Griffinburg de&s;ired I would take the work and work with the ladies. I took an apron and ruffles to make; and there was a lady to drink tea that day; after tea, Lord Baltimore &s;aid, he thought the la|dies &s;hould go te cards. The eldelt Mi&s;s entreated me very much to play, but I refu&s;ed, and &s;aid I could not: I did not chu&s;e it. As &s;oon as they had got to play, I retired to the next room; Mrs. Griffinburg came unto me, and told me &s;he wanted me to &s;ee the apartment &s;he had been preparing for me, for that I could not have that room I was in in the morning; there&s;ore &s;he carri|ed me up into a &s;tone garret: it &s;eemed to be all &s;tone; it was very cold, and &s;truck like a well, and was among all the fervants, that I was very much frightened and uneafy about it.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was there a window?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a window cut out of the lead|ing; I could &s;ee nothing but a bit of the leading of the
<PB N="37" REF="010919_0036_0F852930562F0BF0">hou&s;e, which looked out upon the gutter, and a bit of a &s;ky light. I was very much frightened and unea&s;y, and thought it very odd I could not have a better room in &s;uch a hou&s;e as that. I was afraid that now he had done with me him&s;elf, that he did intend I &s;hould be ex|po&s;ed to any body that he might &s;end. Upon that I told Mrs. Griffinburg that I dur&s;t not lie there; &s;he, upon that, &s;aid, to oblige me, &s;he would bring up a little bed, and He there a night or two. Then I came down &s;tairs again to &s;upper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>With whom did you &s;up?</P>

<P>With the lady that came to &s;ee him, Doc|tor Griffinburg, Madam Saunier, and the governe&s;s, the two Mi&s;&s;es, and Lord Baltimore; but I neither eat nor drank. On Sunday I kept up in the garret, and they came often and di&s;turbed me, that I could have no re&s;t any where. I came down &s;tairs to breakfa&s;t, and then went up again, and came down again to dinner; and after dinner I &s;tood up at the window, and as I was s&s;tanding up at the window, (this was the corner win|dow, and looked toward Hamp&s;tead) as I was &s;tanding, I thought I &s;aw Mr. Davis. the per&s;on to whom I was en|gaged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who was in the room with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two more ladies that came to dinner that day, Madam Saunier, and the governe&s;s and the two children, and my&s;elf; they &s;ix were &s;tanding up at the fire &s;ide while I went to the window; there I &s;aw Mr. Davis; and when I fir&s;t &s;aw him I was &s;o &s;truck I could not tell how to &s;tand; and fearing that he &s;hould not &s;ee me, when he looked up I thought he did not know me; but he went behind a wall towards the Foundling Ho&s;pital, and there peeped two or three times, till I was &s;ure he knew me. He took a book out of his pocket, and made a motion with his hand for me to write; with that I waved my hand for him to come further, but he did not under&s;tand me; therefore, when I went to the next window, at fir&s;t &s;ight I lo&s;t him, but &s;eeing him again, I waved my hand for him to come further, and then I ran into the next room, which was the room Lord Baltimore generally &s;at in; but I ran in hap hazard, without thinking whether he was there or no, and called out to him in great agony, I cannot come to you! I cannot come to you! This was the other corner room, the we&s;t &s;ide of the hou&s;e; I cro&s;&s;ed the room the bow-window is in, to go to that
<PB N="38" REF="010919_0037_0F85293115D14FD8">room. He &s;aid are you well? But I prevented him, by a&s;king, is my father well! He &s;aid Yes, he is well, and we are all well; he &s;aid then, how do you do? Then he &s;aid, where is Mrs. Harvey? I &s;aid I knew nothing of her. He then &s;aid, is all well? With that I was ready to drop: I &s;aid, good bye, and &s;hut down the window.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What was the rea&s;on of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feared &s;ome of the women would come; and before I could get out of the room Lord Baltimore came in. I was &s;o flurried and was all in a tremble, that I did not &s;peak to him as he came in, nor he to me. After this I intreated the maid to get me a pen, ink, and paper, and bring it up into my room, meaning the garret, and not tell any body of it, becau&s;e I wanted it to amu&s;e me. I lay in the garret that night, and next morning &s;he brought me a pen and ink. I began to write imme|diately to my father, but was &s;o prevented that I could not go on with my letter: this is a part of it <STAGE>(<HI>produced</HI>)</STAGE> I did not throw it out of the window: This was on Monday morning. While I was writing this letter, Mrs. Griffinburg came, and &s;aid the milliner had brought me &s;ome caps; I &s;aid I did not care to come down: I told Mrs. Griffinburg &s;he might take what &s;he plea&s;ed; &s;he &s;aid, I mu&s;t go down: With that, I went to the milli|ner; &s;he had brought &s;ome caps and cloaks: With that, I took one that I thought looked the decente&s;t, and that was all; Mrs. Griffinburgh intreated me very much to &s;peak for more things: and &s;aid I mu&s;t have &s;ome a|prons. I a&s;ked the woman if &s;he had any flowered mu&s;|lin; &s;he &s;aid, &s;he would bring it when &s;he came again; that was the &s;ub&s;tance of what pa&s;&s;ed then. I went and I had my breakfa&s;t with the family; Then I went up into my garret again, and Mrs. Griffinburg came after me. I a&s;ked where my Lord was? &s;he a&s;ked if I want|ed him? I told her, yes. I wanted to know if ever he in|tended I &s;hould &s;ee my friends again; for I could not bear to live &s;o. She de&s;ired I would take my work and go down &s;tairs; which accordingly I did: And &s;oon af|ter I came in, Lord Baltimore came in, and clapt me upon the &s;houlder, as I &s;at with my back to the door; and told me he was coming to tell me &s;omething that would plea&s;e me very much, that I &s;hould &s;ee my father that day without fail: With this, to be &s;ure I was plea&s;|ed, and went up &s;tairs with intent to put my things on. Mrs. Griffinburgh followed me, and &s;aid my father, was &s;ent for to come to her hou&s;e, and that I mu&s;t make
<PB N="39" REF="010919_0038_0F852931DD31B970">ha&s;te, and go directly; for he would be there before I could get there; &s;he helped to put on my things; and I came down &s;tairs into the room next the Foundling Ho&s;pital; there was a lady that had been there the day before. Lord Baltimore began to tell her what a religious lady I was; and that he was &s;orry for many things he had &s;aid to me. What his rea&s;on was for this I don't know, except he thought I &s;hould expo&s;e him too much. Some time after this, he led me into another room; and when he got me there, he &s;aid I now was going to &s;ee my father; that he was &s;ent for, and I was going to Mrs. Griffinburg's to meet him. He told me I mu&s;t &s;ay I was willing to &s;tay; and if I would tell my father I was &s;atisfied and ea&s;y, he would do any thing for me that I de&s;ired: I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him that I would, but I mu&s;t &s;ee my father alone: He &s;aid, then he would &s;peak to him fir&s;t. I told him, he might, but I would &s;peak to him alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Explain your meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>My meaning was this, Sir, that I might put him into &s;ome way of geting me away, if I could not get away with him; then he &s;aid, I &s;hould take the little Mi&s;s, and I &s;hould &s;ay to my father, I was a companion of that lady; to that I only &s;aid, very well: Then we were &s;ent on to Mrs. Griffinburg's hou&s;e, with an intent to meet my father, in Dean &s;treet, Soho; I went to this hou&s;e; when I was there, I &s;aid to Mrs. Griffinburg, I thought you &s;aid my father would be here, before I &s;hould get here; but I &s;ee you have deceived me, as you have done all along. She &s;aid he would come pre&s;ently. In about two hours after this, or rather more, Lord Baltimore and Dr. Griffinburg came. As &s;oon as he came in, I &s;aid, I thought you told me I was to &s;ee my father; but I &s;ee you have deceived me, as you have all along; and I &s;ee I &s;hall not &s;ee my &s;ather to-night; he &s;aid, yes, you &s;hall: But what do you think has happened? Your father has taken up Mrs. Harvey, and put her into the round-hou&s;e: This gave me &s;ome plea&s;ure, but I dared not &s;hew it; I did not know what to an&s;wer; at la&s;t, I &s;aid, I did not &s;uppo&s;e that would do any good, for &s;he would not tell where I was: Soon after this, in came another man, and &s;aid, Lord Baltimore's hou&s;e was be&s;et with Ju&s;tice Fielding's men: He fell into a pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;aid my father mu&s;t be a fine man indeed, to &s;et to work &s;uch rogues as Ju&s;tice Fielding, and his men, were, that they were the greate&s;t
<PB N="40" REF="010919_0039_0F85293296031DD8">rognes that could be. I was frightened, and thought my life and my friends were in danger, becau&s;e he was in &s;uch a rage; and I was afraid, having much about the &s;ame opinion of him, that he had of Ju&s;tice Field|ing, that may-be he might &s;end &s;ome of his men and &s;et the hom&s;e on fire, or do &s;ome mi&s;chief. After this there was a great demur about Mrs. Harvey's being at the round-hou&s;e, and how they &s;hould get at her, and get her bailed: Sometime after this, I found that Mrs. Griffinburg had been to &s;et if &s;he could come at her; Mrs. Griffinburg &s;aid &s;o, that &s;he could not; with that they were in a great taking, in what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to proceed to get this woman bailed.</P>

<P>Lord Baltimore, and Dr. and Mrs. Griffinburg; then I &s;tudied what I &s;hould &s;ay and do: At la&s;t, I &s;aid, that if they had got Mrs. Harvey (I &s;poke to Lord Baltimore) they might depend upon it, they would never deliever her up, till I was &s;et at liberty: I told them, if they had a mind Mrs. Harvey &s;hould be &s;et free, it mu&s;t be me that could do it; and if they would let me &s;ee my father, and I could &s;ettle things to my mind, I could relea&s;e her if I plea&s;ed. In two or three hours they got a man to go, upon account of &s;peaking Engli&s;h: they &s;aid, if Dr. Griffinburg went, they &s;uppo&s;ed that the old man (meaning my father) would think he &s;hould be run away with: Then they got &s;ome trade&s;man to go along with them to carry the letter, which I had then wrote, if I remember right, at Dr. Griffinburg's, to my father.</P>

<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>The intent of it was for my father to come to me: We went then to Whitechapel; I went in a coach with Lord Baltimore, Dr. Griffinburg, this man, the Doctor's niece, and the little girl: This was on Monday.</P>

<P>Was there any &s;ervants attending the coach?</P>

<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;aw one run on the &s;ide of the coach as I went; it was Pierini, they call him the valet de cham|bre: We ment to a tavern; I cannot &s;ay what it was; I believe I &s;hould know it again, if I &s;aw it: There was only a little boy that led the way up to a back room: When we came there, this man, the tradefinan, was &s;ent with the letter to my father: He came back and brought word, that my father had been out ever &s;ince nine in the morning, in &s;earch of me, and brought the
<PB N="41" REF="010919_0040_0F852933580AF3F8">letter back. I was very loth to go back again; I did not know what to do. I wrote to the landlord of our hou&s;e, to tell my father to be as ea&s;y as he could; for I would &s;end for him next morning at ten, as Lord Bal|timore told me I &s;hould: At that time at the tavern he told me I &s;hould &s;end for him in the morning: It was the land-lord of my father's hou&s;e, who&s;e name is Berry. The tradelman brought word back again, my father was not come home as yet; &s;o Lord Baltimore would go back again, and &s;aid, he &s;uppo&s;ed they were making a fine piece of work at the other end of the town. We went back; and when we came to Covent-Garden, the coach &s;topped, and the trade&s;man got out, and went to Ju&s;tice Fielding's, according to their orders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did he come back again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did, along with Ju&s;tice Fielding's clerk, who brought a card, with his compliments, and that I &s;hould &s;ee my friends there: I did not know what to &s;ay to the man; I made no an&s;wer, but gave the card into Lord Baltimore's hand; he read it, and &s;aid I &s;hould not go. With that, I told the man to tell my friends, that I was there (I mean at Dr. Griffinburg's hou&s;e) and that I de&s;ired my friends to come to me there directly; the man did not come any more; but there was me&s;&s;enger after me&s;&s;enger, came to tell him of men being about the hou&s;e, and a great mob in the yard; and withal, that there was &s;ome women had been crying there. With that, I was afraid it &s;hould come out, that I had &s;een Mr. Davis at the window. I beg|ged of my Lord, to let me &s;peak to the man fir&s;t. I found there was another me&s;&s;enger come about &s;ome|thing; I went out of the room, and there was Broughton, which we call the Steward: I a&s;ked him what the woman &s;aid? He &s;aid I was &s;een out of the window; I told him I was, and I wanted to &s;peak to him about that. I told him I thought that my life depended on its being known; and therefore begged, if he had any value for a per&s;on's life, he would not mention to my Lord, that I was &s;een at the window. He &s;aid he would promi&s;e no &s;uch think, his bread depended upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. I told him he need not fear his bread, he might get it another way. At la&s;t, he promi&s;ed me, that he would not tell him unle&s;s he a&s;ked him. Then I came into the room, and what pa&s;&s;ed, I do not know.</P>

<P>I thought may-be he would murder me that night, or &s;end me away. After this there was a great deal of con&s;u&s;ion, and they talked in another language; I was fearful they were contriving to go &s;ome other way, or &s;end me abroad. My Lord was &s;o frightened, he was afraid to go home for fear they &s;hould take me out of the coach: I told him they could not take me out unle&s;s I would, and that I would not go with Ju&s;tice Fielding's men. After &s;ome time, we &s;et out to go to Lord Baltimore's again. When we came within two or three doors, the coach &s;topped, by who&s;e order I do not know; Right again&s;t the coach there were &s;everal men &s;tanding; I got up to &s;ee if I could &s;ee any of my friends; but Lord Baltimore pul|led me down, a&s;ked me what I got up for, and ordered the coach to drive on immediately: which they did as fa&s;t as they could; and the men &s;trove to'get into the yard along with the coach; Ju&s;tice Fielding's men, I believe they were; they &s;trove to get into the gates, and get|ting out of the coach, I cried out, let the men come in: He pulled me in, and &s;aid I &s;hould not &s;tay. With that, we went up &s;tairs; when we got there, the little Jew came up, and &s;aid, my Lord, Piereni wants you: With that, I got up, and walked about the room in great di&s;tre&s;s, fearing it was coming out that I had been &s;een out of the window. I thought I would &s;trive to hide it; I plucked up all the courage I could, and a&s;ked him as &s;oon as he came in, what Piereni wanted. He &s;aid I had &s;poke to &s;omebody out of the window; I told him I had; he a&s;ked what I had &s;aid: I told him; but did not tell my di&s;tre&s;s becau&s;e I was afraid: When I had told him, he &s;aid he could not blame me, he &s;hould have done the &s;ame him&s;elf. He &s;uppo&s;ed I was glad to &s;peak to the fir&s;t I had &s;een. With this, I was rejoiced, I had been in &s;uch a terror before, le&s;t he thould kill me for it. After this, he and the doctor talked a good while in &s;ome other language; what, I don't know. By and by, Lord Baltimore &s;aid I mu&s;t go to bed to him; that I mu&s;t lie with him that night, or he &s;hould be wretched: I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; he promi&s;ed me be would not meddle with me; I thought if I did not, he would make me go to bed to him, &s;o I did go to bed to him, and he did not meddle with me. On Tue&s;day morning he got up fir&s;t, and went away, and &s;ent Mrs. Griffinburg to take me up. She came, and &s;aid Lord Baltimore wanted me directly: With that, I got up and went to him. When
<PB N="43" REF="010919_0042_0F852934E4524B48">I came to him, he &s;aid, Well, now we will write to your father, and &s;end for him as propo&s;ed. I had heard over night, that one Mr. Watts was to come in the morning at ten o'clock: So I &s;aid I thought it was bet|ter to &s;tay till ten o'clock, before I &s;ent to my father. I thought it would be Mr. Davis would come by the name of Watts. At ten o'clock I wrote a letter to my father, the purport of which, if I remember right, was this, that I begged my friends would come with all the decency and re&s;pect becoming a nobleman's hou&s;e: He took the letter, and &s;hewed it Mr. Brown, the attorney, and &s;eemed very much plea&s;ed with it, and &s;ent it away. After this, he wanted to know what I &s;hould &s;ay to my father, and whether I would &s;ay as I had told him, that I was willing to &s;tay. I &s;aid I would, but I would &s;ee my father alone by my&s;elf. With that, he &s;aid, he would do any thing to make me ea&s;y. With that, I &s;aid very well, but could not tell what to an&s;wer him. He &s;aid I &s;hould have a hou&s;e to live in, and live with my friends, if I liked it better than living with him. Ju&s;t upon that, Piereni came in, and &s;aid, my Lord, here is Mr. Watts come; but before that, I &s;hould have told you, my Lord &s;aid, that whoever came, I mu&s;t &s;ay I was willing to &s;tay. The man came up, and &s;aid, there was Mr. Watts. Lord Baltimore went out to him.</P>

<P>I don't know; there was Mrs. Griffin|burg and Dr. Griffinburg, backwards and forwards; but whether they were in the room or no, I can't &s;ay. My Lord brought Mr. Watts up &s;tairs; he was in the fir&s;t room, and I was in the farthe&s;t room; he was brought up &s;tairs; The doors happened to &s;tand a jar, that I could ju&s;t &s;ee them, but I could not hear them. It I remem|ber right, there was Piereni in the middle room. My Lord talked with Mr. Watts for about ten minutes; and then my Lord came fir&s;t, and Mr. Watts almo&s;t behind him; and my Lord &s;aid, Mi&s;s, here is a friend of your's; I &s;aid, I don't know the gentleman: He then &s;aid, Mi&s;s, you don't know me, nor do I know you; but I am come from your friends, to know if you are here by your own con&s;ent?

<P>What happened to you after this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I went into the next room; I did not know what to think of Mr. Watts, and I had no thoughts at that time of a lawyer; therefore I went into the middle of the room, to &s;ee if I could &s;ee any friends about; when I &s;aw none, I opened the window; this was on the fir&s;t floor: I &s;aw &s;everal friends at that time, but one pretty near that I knew, Mr. Cay: He a&s;ked me, if I was there by my own con&s;ent? I &s;aid yes; but I &s;aid I wanted to &s;ee my father. He &s;aid, my father would never come within tho&s;e walls; I then turned away in a great trembling, and &s;aid, then I never &s;hall &s;ee him; that was my way of thinking at that time; I thought, that as they would not let him come in, I &s;hould never get out. After that, Lord Paltimore came in again, and &s;aid, I mu&s;t go to Lord Mansfield's, and &s;aid, I mu&s;t &s;ay I was there with my own con&s;ent, and not to tell Lord Mansfield particulars.</P>

<P>Lord Baltimore &s;aid, if I did not &s;tand by him now, he &s;hould be undone: He then &s;aid, will you be faithful to me now, and keep your word; other|wi&s;e I am undone? I &s;aid I would? but I would tell my Lord Mansfield, that I wanted to &s;ee my father a|lone. He &s;aid, if I would be ea&s;y, and tell him I was ea&s;y and &s;atisfied, I &s;hould have a hou&s;e, and live with my friends, and have the young man. With that, I told him I would &s;ay, I was willing to be there, as I promi&s;ed him before, but would &s;ee my friends alone. He a&s;ked, if I would tell my friends the particulars? I told him, yes; I would tell my friends all the truth. After this, he &s;aid very little. Another me&s;&s;age came for him. He came up, and &s;aid, we were to go to Lord Mansfield's immediately. I &s;aid, very well, I was very willing. Mr. Brown, the lawyer, my Lord, and my&s;elf, went together in Mr. Brown's chariot.</P>

On the Friday there came a Jew-like man, that &s;ent for me and my daughter to a tavern on the other &s;ide Tower-hill (I have forgot the &s;ign) to de&s;ire me to meet about my daugh|ter's affairs. He &s;aid to me, this day I &s;aw your daughter. Said I, we are in great concern to know where &s;he is. Where did you &s;ee her? Said he, I &s;aw her this day at Bethnal-green; but I never &s;aw her before in my life. He promi&s;ed that on the morrow following, which was Saturday, I &s;hould &s;ee my daughter between ten and three in the afternoon. He &s;wore to it many times. If my Lord had &s;ent me twenty bank notes it would not have &s;atisfied me; we wanted to &s;ee my daughter. That gave us a little relief; we were in hopes till the time was expired. We heard no more about her for five or &s;ix days. We were &s;eeking after Mrs. Harvey, and could not &s;ind her for &s;ome time. We heard &s;he came home on Chri&s;tmas-day at night: we took all the methods we could to take her up; and we did take her up. I had one that waited in Mr. Goff's hou&s;e in the

<P>When we went to my Lord Mansfield's, the &s;ervant told us, he was not within then, but was at L. C. J. Wilmot's. The &s;ervant &s;aid he would go and ac|quaint his Lord&s;hip that we were there. Then he went, and in a &s;hort time Lord Mansfield came in. When he came into the hall, he a&s;ked if the Habeas Corpus was &s;erved; Mr. Watts an&s;wered, it was. His Lord&s;hip then &s;aid, gentlemen, if this young lady &s;hould choo&s;e to go with Lord Baltimore, or words to that purpo&s;e, &s;o it mu&s;t be; for no per&s;on has any right to compel her to go any where again&s;t her own con&s;ent. Therefore, his Lord|&s;hip &s;id, none of us mu&s;t touch her. To which &s;omebody pre&s;ent &s;aid, there was no re&s;cue intended. Lord Mansfield having &s;aid, if any of us touched her he mu&s;t commit us; he then &s;aid, if &s;he &s;hould choo&s;e to go with her father and friends, if Lord Baltimore, or any of his people, touch her, I will commit them. Lord Mansfield very conde&s;cendingly added, I give you this friendly hint that you may know how to behave. Up|on which Lord Mansfield retired into an adjoining room, having ordered Mr. Watts to &s;end to Lord Balti|more, and let him know that he (Lord Mansfield) was ready. In a very &s;hort time I &s;aw a carriage with two gentlemen and Mi&s;s Woodcock. The fir&s;t gentleman walked in, and as he appeared to me, with much pre|&s;ence of mind: from whence I concluded it was not Lord Baltimore. The other gentleman, whom I after|wards
<PB N="76" REF="010919_0075_0F85286B38DF5768">found to be Lord Baltimore, handed Mi&s;s Wood|cock out of the carriage; when he led her up the &s;teps into the hall, &s;he put her hand on Mr. Potts's arm, look|ed up in his face, &s;hook her head, and the tears &s;tood in her eyes. Mr. Potts lifted up his right hand, as I im|agined, intending to lay his hand upon her's: when I pulled back his hand, and &s;aid, are you mad? recollect|ing what Lord Mansfield had &s;aid. Several gentlemen &s;aid, do not touch her. Mr. Potts &s;aid, I did not touch her; &s;he has laid hold of me. At this time, a &s;ervant opened a door of the room adjoining: upon which Lord Baltimore and Mi&s;s Woodcock went into that room, and the door was &s;hut. When they had been there about three quarters of an hour, more or le&s;s, I heard a bell ring, and the door was opened. And I knew Lord Mansfield's voice when he &s;aid, is Mr. Wood|cock the father, and Mi&s;s Woodcock the &s;i&s;ter, there? To which it was an&s;wered from without, no, my Lord, they are not here, but ju&s;t by. Upon which his Lord&s;hip ordered they &s;hould be &s;ent for. They were &s;ent for; and in a few minutes came Mr. Woodcock and his two daughters, when they were introduced, and the door &s;hut after them. After they had been introduced about a quarter of an hour, or nearly that, a little more or le&s;s, the door was thrown open, and the gentlemen pre&s;ent that plea&s;ed, were de&s;ired to walk in. When we walked in to the room, Mr. Woodcock the father, and his three danghters, were there, and no other per&s;on that I ob&s;erved. I went up to her, and &s;aid, well girl, how do you &s;tand affected now? to go with your father and friends, or with Lord Baltimore? She an&s;wered, to go with my father and friends. I then retreated a few &s;teps.</P>

<P>Whether any of her friends that went in with you &s;aid any thing or no?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Wat&s;on.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell; in a &s;hort time the door was opened, the further door, Lord Mansfield appeared and &s;aid to this purpo&s;e; Madam, is it your de&s;ire, or are you willing (I cannot &s;wear po&s;itively to all his words, or the exact po&s;ition of &s;uch of them as I do remember) are you willing to return with Lord Baltimore to his hou&s;e in Southampton-Row, or to go with your father and friends? to which &s;he an&s;wered, with my father and friends by all means. Lord Mansfield a&s;ked her, whe|ther &s;he had been taken or carried without her own con|&s;ent, and detained again&s;t her will? &s;he an&s;wered, that
<PB N="77" REF="010919_0076_0F85286BD82A10D0">as &s;he had been carried to a place which &s;he did not then know, but found afterwards to be Lord Baltimore's, &s;he had been kept all this time again&s;t her will. Lord Manf|field repeated the que&s;tions, with &s;ome variation of the terms, and told her, that her going with her father and friends was not to be under&s;tood to be in cu&s;tody by them, but to be at liberty as u&s;ual. After this his Lord&s;hip &s;aid to us that were pre&s;ent to this effect; Gentlemen, I would have you take notice of the&s;e an&s;wers, becau&s;e po&s;&s;ibly this matter may be variou&s;ly talked of in public, and ju|&s;tice ought to be done to both parties; for when this lady came before me on her private examination, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed, at fir&s;t, her inclination to return with Lord Baltimore, however &s;he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to be permit|ted to &s;ee her father and &s;i&s;ter, or &s;i&s;ters, upon which I called for her father and &s;i&s;ters, and now &s;he has an&s;wer|ed as you have heard. His Lord&s;hip then &s;aid &s;omewhat, which I have not been able ever &s;ince to recollect, for I had attended to what he had &s;aid, when his Lord&s;hip had de&s;ired we would take notice of her an&s;wers, but his Lord&s;hip concluded with this, and I &s;uppo&s;e gentlemen, none of you make any doubt of it. His Lord&s;hip then &s;aid, madam you are at full liberty to go where you plea&s;e. His Lord&s;hip then a&s;ked Mr. Watts if the habeas corpus was regularly &s;erved? to which he an&s;wered, it was. Then his Lord&s;hip &s;aid, it was not &s;erved by any of Sir John Fielding's men was it? it was an&s;wered none of us were in any connection with them. Then &s;aid Mr. Watts I &s;erved it my&s;elf, and would not do &s;uch another job for five hundred pounds.</P>

She &s;aid, by no means, I am willing to go with my friends, I have rea&s;on to be thankful to God Almigh|ty for this day's deliverance, I hoped in God, as he knew I was innocent, and taken away without my con&s;ent, that &s;ome time or other he would open a door for my deliverance, though I did not &s;ee how; I heard &s;ome of her friends making an appointment to dine together at a tavern, and I being under an appointment to dinner, left them; I never &s;aw her to my knowledge before.</P>

<P>I was at Lord Mansfield's that day, I was there when Mi&s;s Woodcock came there; and after &s;he had been introduced to Lord Mansfield, for &s;ome little time, the parlour door was opened, and we that were in the outer room, were admitted into the room where &s;he was: then Lord Mansfield a&s;ked her, before us all, whether &s;he would return home with her friends, or re|turn back to Lord Baltimore's hou&s;e! &s;he gave for an|&s;wer, home with her friends: he a&s;ked her no que&s;tion a&s;ter that; he &s;aid this, that when he had examined her by her&s;elf before, that &s;he had mentioned returning to Lord Baltimore's hou&s;e, but my Lord immediately added that &s;he &s;aid, I will tell my father my mind; my Lord repeated the &s;ame que&s;tion again, &s;he &s;aid with her friends: in con&s;equence of that we all went out of the room and handed her down the &s;teps.</P>

<P>I had orders to come next morning, and a promi&s;e of &s;eeing my Lord: this was between 10 and 11 o'clock. I was introduced to my Lord, and my Lord in a very genteel manner acco&s;ted me, he had been told who I was, and that I was an attorney on behalf of Mi&s;s Wood|cock. I told him, my Lord, I wait on your Lord&s;hip, in order to acquaint you, that the friends of Mi&s;s Wood|cock have found that &s;he is here; but are doubtful whe|ther &s;he is here with or again&s;t her will, and it highly becomes your Lord&s;hip to di&s;clo&s;e this matter; for as I find &s;he is of age, if &s;he is here with her will, it is not in the power of her friends, or the law it&s;elf, to relea&s;e her; if &s;he is here again&s;t her will, you cannot detain her. Upon this, my Lord acquainted me &s;he was there with her con&s;ent, perfectly happy. My Lord retired from me a minute or two, and he came to me again, and de&s;ired me to follow him; I did, and he opened a door that introduced me into a room where was Mi&s;s Wood|cock, and Mrs. Griffinburg, I believe; it was a per&s;on much like her. My Lord, in a polite manner, pointed
<PB N="87" REF="010919_0086_0F8528765FD0A740">his hand, and &s;aid, that, Sir, is the lady in que&s;tion. Upon that I made her a bow, and what I am going to &s;ay now is the &s;ub&s;tance of the matter: I do not pretend, nor will I &s;wear to the words that pa&s;&s;ed; I will tell them then as they were. On my making a bow, it is my pre&s;ent apprehen&s;ion that &s;he immediately was &s;tand|ing very near the door, ready to receive &s;ome per&s;on; I did not know that; I a&s;ked her a que&s;tion: I a&s;ked her, whether &s;he was there with her own con&s;ent. She an|&s;wered immediately, I am here with my free will and con&s;ent. Upon that my Lord looked upon me with a complacency, and &s;eeming expectation that I &s;hould be &s;atisfied: upon that I &s;aid to my Lord, (he looked to me expecting an an&s;wer, whether I was or was not &s;atisfi|ed,) I am not &s;urpri&s;ed that your Lord&s;hip has got temp|tations enough to gain the approbation of this young woman. Mi&s;s Woodcock &s;aid, where is my father? I &s;aid, very near, Mi&s;s:&mdash;And my &s;i&s;ters?&mdash;I &s;aid, yes, they are. Said &s;he, can I &s;ee them? I &s;aid, I do not know. Says my Lord, I &s;hall take that as a great fa|vour, if you will fetch the father and the &s;i&s;ters, that they may hear her declarations, and receive the &s;ame &s;a|tis&s;action as you have done, Upon this I told them, I was willing to go: upon this I went out of the hou&s;e. I did not &s;erve the Habeas, but went out, and got a promi&s;e from my Lord I &s;hould come in again. I &s;aw &s;everal friends within a few yards of Lord Baltimore's, and I told them what &s;he &s;aid. They immediately &s;aid, they did not care what declarations &s;he made under my Lord's roof and influence, and would not go there, unle&s;s with two friends, and &s;o &s;ee her alone. I went to my Lord, and told him this matter: he was rather angry at it, and &s;aid it was an in&s;ult upon him; he did not &s;ee any occa&s;ion he had to &s;atisfy any body but the father and &s;i&s;ters, and as to having two friends he would not agree to it, and gave this as a rea&s;on: Have I not as much rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that her father and her friends would influence her to tell another tale, as they have to &s;u&s;pect me? I an&s;wered, I thought if his Lord&s;hip was &s;atisfied that the declarations &s;he had made to me were genuine and clear, that he might even &s;end her home, and they could not keep her from him. He told me a &s;tory of &s;ome of Sir John Fielding's men having made a riot, or &s;omething of that &s;ort; I told him, that all that was again&s;t him was what I had in my pocket; nor do I know to this moment, how, or by what means,
<PB N="88" REF="010919_0087_0F852877175DCFC0">Sir John's men came to go there that night, becau&s;e there was no accu&s;ation whatever. I did not know that they were there: I believe there were nobody there but ten or twelve per&s;ons with me to &s;erve the Habeas Cor|pus. He would not believe but I was privy to it. He took hold of me by the arm, and conducted me down &s;tairs, and I thought was going to turn me out of doors, but this was my imagination, in&s;tead of that, he con|ducted me into a room, through another room, and there was a man in the room &s;tanding: and then &s;at me down in an elbow-chair on the off-&s;ide of the fire, to the door: he &s;et him&s;elf down on the off-&s;ide of the fire and he or|dered the man to &s;it down by me, or by us. My Lord kept &s;till angry about Sir John's men, and I endeavour|ed to argue every thing I could for the &s;ake of his Lord&s;hip, to di&s;charge the girl undoubtedly. My Lord refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to let the girl's father and &s;i&s;ter, and two friends come. I then found it ab&s;olately nece&s;&s;ary that I mu&s;t &s;erve the Habeas; I then gave it to his Lord|&s;hip: I &s;aid, my Lord I will, if it will oblige your Lord|&s;hip, I will wait upon my Lord Mansfield, and de&s;ire him to appoint a time. I went to Lord Mansfield; he appointed the time immediately. I wrote a card to Lord Baltimore, and he attended at Lord Mansfield's. My Lord, Mi&s;s Woodcock, and Mr. Brown, came in his chariot; before they returned, my Lord Mansfield came out of his &s;tudy to me, and enquired if her father and &s;i&s;ters were there: I &s;aid not there, but very near; up|on which my Lord ordered me to &s;end for them: I did, and they came, and when they came were introduced to Lord Mansfield; but when Lord Mansfield thought proper, he ordered all the friends and me to come in; I went in, and, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, Lord Mansfield &s;aid, Gentlemen, I called you in, that you may hear my examination of this girl; and then he a&s;ked her, are you willing to go back with Lord Baltimore? Or are you willing and de&s;ireous to go with your father and friends? Says &s;he, with my father and friends, my Lord. He repeated that &s;everal times, and &s;he made the &s;ame &s;ort of an&s;wer. My Lord then turned to us, and he &s;aid, Gentlemen, I think it my duty to acquaint you, that notwith&s;tanding the an&s;wers you have heard to the que&s;tions I have put to this girl, upon her fir&s;t ex|amination, &s;he did declare &s;he was willing to go back to my Lord Baltimore's.

<P>My Lord, and Gentlemen,</P>
<P>I have put my&s;elf upon my country, in hopes that prejudice and clamour will avail nothing in this place, where it is the privilege of the meane&s;t of the king's &s;ubjects to be pre&s;umed innocent, until his guilt has been made appear by legal evidence. I wi&s;h I could &s;ay that I had been treated abroad with the &s;ame candour. I have been loaded with obloquy, the mo&s;t malignant libels have been circulated, and every other method which malice could devi&s;e, have been taken, to create general prejudice again&s;t me. I thank God, that, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, I have had firmne&s;s and re&s;olution enough to meet my accu&s;ers face to face, and provoke
<PB N="93" REF="010919_0092_0F85287C95550B58">an enquiry into my conduct. <HI>Hic murus ahaeneus e&s;te&mdash; nil con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ire &s;ibi.</HI> The charge again&s;t me, and again&s;t the&s;e poor people, who are involved with me, becau&s;e they might otherwi&s;e have been ju&s;t witne&s;&s;es of my innocence, is in its nature very ea&s;y to be made, and hard to be di&s;proved. The accu&s;er has the advantage of &s;upporting it by a direct and po&s;itive oath; the de|fence can only be collected from circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>My defence is compo&s;ed then of a variety of circum|&s;tances; all tending to &s;hew the fal&s;ity of this charge, the ab&s;urdity of it, the improbability that it could be true. It will be laid before the jury under the direc|tion of my coun&s;el; and I have the confidence of an innocent man, that it will be manife&s;t to your Lord&s;hip, the jury, and the whole world, that the &s;tory told by this woman is a perver&s;ion of truth in every particular. What could induce her to make &s;uch a charge I can only &s;u&s;pect: very &s;oon after &s;he came to my hou&s;e, upon a repre&s;entation to me that her father was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, I &s;ent him a con&s;iderable &s;um of money; whether the ea&s;e with which that money was obtained from me might &s;ugge&s;t the idea as a means of obtaining a larger &s;um of money, or whether it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to de|&s;troy me, in order e&s;tabli&s;h the character of the girl to the world, I know not; but I do aver, upon the word of a man of honour, that there is no truth in any thing which has been &s;aid or &s;worn, of my having offered violence to this girl. I ever held &s;uch brutality in ab|horrence. I am totally again&s;t all force; and for me to have forced this woman, con&s;idering my weak &s;tate of health and my &s;trength, is not only a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al but a phy|&s;ical impo&s;&s;ibility. She is, as to bodily health, &s;tronger than I am. Strange opinions, upon &s;ubjects foreign to this charge, have been fal&s;ly imputed to me, to inflame this accu&s;ation. Libertine as I am repre&s;ented, I hold no &s;uch opinions. Much has been &s;aid again&s;t me, that I &s;educed this girl from her parents: &s;eduction is not the point of this charge; but I do a&s;&s;ure your lord&s;hip and the jury, this part of the ca&s;e has been aggravated exceedingly beyond the truth. If I have been in any degree to blame. I am &s;ure I have &s;ufficiently atoned for every indi&s;cretion, which a weak attachment to this unworthy woman may have led me into, by having &s;uf|fered the di&s;grace of being expo&s;ed as a criminal at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar, in the county of which my father had the honour to repre&s;ent in parliament; and where I had &s;ome preten|&s;ions

<P>I will take up no more of your Lord&s;hip's time than to add, that if I had been con&s;cious of the guilt now imputed to me, I could have kept my&s;elf and my fortune out of the reach of the laws of this country. I am a citizen of the world; I could have lived any where: but I love my country, and &s;ubmit to its laws; re&s;olving, that my innocence &s;hould be ju&s;tified by the laws. I now, by my own voluntary act, by &s;urrendering my&s;elf to the Count of King's Bench, &s;take upon the verdict of twelve men, my life, my fortune, and what is dearer to me, my honour.</P>

Mr. BARON SMYTHE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>THE pri&s;oner at the bar, Lord Baltimore, &s;tands in|dicted for feloniou&s;ly ravi&s;hing and carnally know|ing Sarah Woodcock, &s;pin&s;ter, again&s;t her will, on the 22d of December la&s;t at Ep&s;om; again&s;t the &s;tatute which makes this offence felony: and the other two pri&s;oners are indicted as acce&s;&s;aries before the fact, by feloniou&s;ly and maliciou&s;ly procuring, aiding and abetting Lord Baltimore, to commit the &s;aid rape, at the &s;aid time and place. To this they have pleaded Not Guilty; and you are to try if they are guilty. Before I &s;tate to you the evidence, I will mention to you two or three things: In the fir&s;t place, my Lord complains of libels, and print|ed accounts of this tran&s;action, which have been circu|lated. It is a mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable practice, and tends to the perver&s;ion of public ju&s;tice; and therefore if you have &s;een any thing printed on the &s;ide of the pro&s;ecu|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ix or the pri&s;oners, I mu&s;t de&s;ire you to dive&s;t your|&s;elves of any prejudice that &s;uch publications may have occa&s;ioned, and give your verdict only on the evidence now laid before you. Another thing I de&s;ire, is, that whichever way the verdict is given, none of the friends of any of the parties will make u&s;e of any expre&s;&s;ion of approbation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> applau&s;e, which are extremely improper and indecent in a court of ju&s;tice, and I &s;hall certainly commit any per&s;on whom I &s;hall know to be guilty of it. The la&s;t thing I &s;hall mention to you, is, to de&s;ire that no re&s;entment you may feel at the manner in which &s;he was carried to Lord Baltimore's hou&s;e, may have any in|fluence on your verdict; for however unwarrantable the manner was, in which &s;he came into his power, if at the time he lay with her it was by her con&s;ent, he is not guilty of the offence of which he is indicted; though it was proper to be given in evidence in this trial, to ac|count for her being with him, and his having an oppor|tunity of committing the crime; and to &s;hew, from the indirect manner of getting her to his hou&s;e, the greater probability that her account is true. Having &s;aid this, I will now &s;tate to you the whole evidence as particular|ly as I can.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="010919_0140_0F8528A958D21870">
<HI>Mr. Baron Smythe then &s;tated the whole of the evidence to the jury, as before given, which took up three hours, and on account of the length of it is not repeated here; and then con|cluded,</HI></P>
<P>In point of law, the fact is fully proved on my Lord and the other two pri&s;oners, if you believe the evidence of Sarah Woodcock. It is a crime which in its nature can only be proved by the woman on whom it is commit|ted; for &s;he only can tell whether &s;he con&s;ented or no; it is, as my Lord ob&s;erves, very ea&s;y to be made, and hard to be di&s;proved; and the de&s;ence can only be col|lected from circum&s;tances; from the&s;e you mu&s;t judge whether her evidence is or is not to be believed. Lord Hale, in his hi&s;tory of the pleas of the crown
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p. 632, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE>, lays down two rules: I. If complaint is not made &s;oon after the injury is &s;uppo&s;ed to be received; 2. If it is not follow|ed by a recent pro&s;ecution; a &s;trong pre&s;umption ari&s;es that the complaint is malicious. She has owned the in|jury was received December 21&s;t, and the complaint was not made till December 29th; but &s;he has accounted for it in the manner you have heard. The &s;trong part of the ca&s;e, on behalf of the pri&s;oners, is, her not complain|ing when &s;he was at Lord Mansfield's, the &s;upreme ma|gi&s;trate in the kingdom in criminal matters: you have heard how &s;he has explained and accounted for her con|duct in that particular, which you will judge of. Upon the whole, if you believe that &s;he made the di&s;covery as &s;oon as &s;he knew &s;he had an opportunity of doing it, and that her account is true, you will find all the pri&s;oners guilty; if you believe that the did not make the di&s;covery as &s;oon as &s;he had an opportunity, and from thence, or other circum&s;tances, are not &s;atisfied her account is true, you will find them all not guilty; for if he is not guilty, they cannot be &s;o; for they cannot be acce&s;&s;ary to a crime which was never committed.</P>
