<HEAD>AN ELEGY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<L>AWAKE, my mu&s;e, and &s;eek great WESLEY fled!</L>
<L>This righteous man is number'd with the dead.</L>
<L>How &s;ad and awful is the parting &s;troke,</L>
<L>Which hath the long &s;ub&s;i&s;ting union broke!</L>
<L>WESLEY is &s;et, that bright that &s;hining &s;tar,</L>
<L>Which oft conducted &s;trangers from afar,</L>
<L>To come by faith, and ta&s;te their Saviour's grace,</L>
<L>And humbly bow their &s;ouls before his face.</L>
<L>How long he labour'd in the go&s;pel field!</L>
<L>While hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls his Mi&s;&s;ion &s;eal'd:</L>
<L>Who heard the go&s;pel from his willing tongue,</L>
<L>Upon his lips with fix'd attention hung:</L>
<L>Heard for their lives, and fled from wrath to come</L>
<L>And found in Je&s;u's arms a welcome home.</L>
<L>What regularity his life di&s;play'd!</L>
<L>By rule he liv'd; his mind on God was &s;tay'd.</L>
<L>Je&s;us he lov'd, his Go&s;pel he pur&s;u'd,</L>
<L>And wi&s;h'd, like him, to be divinely good;</L>
<L>His temper cultivated in his brea&s;t,</L>
<L>He learnt of him, and found the promis'd re&s;t;</L>
<L>Thought, &s;poke, and acted like his Lord divine,</L>
<L>And in the &s;ight of men his light did &s;hine.</L>
<L>His works of love, known only to the Lord,</L>
<L>In&s;ure for him a rich, a large reward:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="025048_0003_0FCDAF57870C69B0">Ten thou&s;and acts of gen'rous kindne&s;s &s;hown,</L>
<L>Have gain'd him honour, glory, and renown.</L>
<L>Many have done great things, and are approv'd,</L>
<L>But he excell'd them all, for much he lov'd.</L>
<L>Long did he move in Wi&s;dom's plea&s;ant ways;</L>
<L>He lov'd and &s;ought her in his youthful days:</L>
<L>And to his late&s;t years advancing &s;till</L>
<L>In that ble&s;t way that leads to Zion's hill,</L>
<L>He gain'd at la&s;t the bright, the glorious prize,</L>
<L>The tree of life, which grows in Paradi&s;e.</L>
<L>His life was dedicated to the Lord;</L>
<L>And more than &s;ixty years he preach'd his word:</L>
<L>Some millions heard his ready tongue proclaim</L>
<L>The wonders of the great Redeemer's name.</L>
<L>The univer&s;al Saviour he confe&s;s'd,</L>
<L>And &s;ought to bring mankind to ta&s;te his re&s;t.</L>
<L>Proclaim'd abroad "He ta&s;ted death for all;"</L>
<L>And that his grace exten&s;ive, as the fall,</L>
<L>Is freely given to ev'ry willing mind,</L>
<L>Who &s;eek their Saviour and their God to find:</L>
<L>That none were reprobated by decree,</L>
<L>But that God's &s;aving grace for all is free.</L>
<L>He taught mankind their hopes of heaven to place</L>
<L>Upon the Saviour's merits, and his grace,</L>
<L>Proclaim'd Repentance, Faith, Hope, Joy, and Love:</L>
<L>Taught men the way that leads to God above:</L>
<L>Five words well under&s;tood will &s;hew the way,</L>
<L>Repent, Believe, Hope, Love, <HI>and then</HI> Obey.</L>
<L>This was the glorious doctrine which he brought,</L>
<L>This to the human race he freely taught;</L>
<L>And this to many thou&s;and &s;ouls was ble&s;t,</L>
<L>Brought weary wand'rers unto Chri&s;t for re&s;t.</L>
<L>How va&s;t, and, oh! how regular his plan,</L>
<L>For God's great glory, and the good of man!</L>
<L>How wide, and yet how pow'rful was his &s;phere!</L>
<L>He &s;hed his influence far, as well as near.</L>
<L>His &s;ermons and his num rous writings &s;hin'd,</L>
<L>With heav'nly light, a ble&s;&s;ing to mankind.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="025048_0004_0FCDAF59051FA928">His active &s;oul flew &s;wiftly to perform</L>
<L>His Father's will, his heart was always warm.</L>
<L>With God like Enoch he did &s;pend his days:</L>

<L>The&s;e were his choice&s;t plea&s;ures ever high:</L>
<L>He wi&s;h'd in Je&s;u's cau&s;e to live and die.</L>
<L>The greate&s;t ardour of his active mind</L>
<L>Was to proclaim the Go&s;pel to mankind;</L>
<L>And make the Saviour's name and nature known</L>
<L>To all whom he had purchas'd for his own.</L>
<L>He joy'd to &s;ee the blood-bought human race</L>
<L>Partakers of the Saviour's love and grace:</L>
<L>He lov'd to &s;ee them walk in Wi&s;dom's ways,</L>
<L>Hold fa&s;t the truth and joyful end their days.</L>
<L>He &s;ought by every method in his pow'r</L>
<L>To &s;pread the &s;acred Go&s;pel more and more,</L>
<L>To turn the &s;ouls of men from death and &s;in,</L>
<L>And make them feel a Heav'n begun within.</L>
<L>He wi&s;h'd to &s;ee our Je&s;us rule and reign,</L>
<L>In every heart, that &s;in might all be &s;lain:</L>
<L>That every &s;oul might full &s;alvation know,</L>
<L>And thus enjoy a Heav'n begun below.</L>
<L>How did he pray, and thir&s;t, and pant, and long,</L>
<L>That Je&s;us might be prais'd by ev'ry tongue:</L>
<L>That all the world might ta&s;te redeeming love;</L>
<L>And be prepar'd for Heav'ns bright courts above.</L>
<L>And where&s;oever he beheld a &s;ign</L>
<L>That any heart was touch'd with pow'r divine,</L>
<L>It gave him joy beyond what harve&s;t yields,</L>
<L>When plenteous crops are gathered from the fields</L>
<L>But hence my Mu&s;e: Come take a lofty flight,</L>
<L>Pur&s;ue this holy man to realms of light:</L>
<L>Behold him introduc'd to Heaven's high King?</L>
<L>Hark! how the Heav'nly arches loudly ring.</L>
<L>He comes, the faithful per&s;evering man!</L>
<L>Who&s;e life was govern'd by his Saviour's plan!</L>
<L>Who thought, &s;poke, acted, like his glorious Lord,</L>
<L>He comes to ta&s;te a part of his reward!</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="025048_0005_0FCDAF5D00163B68">Behold his happy &s;pirit &s;wiftly ri&s;e!</L>
<L>To Heav'n he lifts his joyful wond'ring eyes!</L>
<L>Convey'd by angels &s;wifter far than light,</L>
<L>The Heav'nly city &s;oon appears in &s;ight.</L>
<L>The &s;hining gates of pearl are open'd wide,</L>
<L>And holy angels are his guard and guide.</L>
<L>How &s;wift he marches on! fre&s;h glory &s;ees;</L>
<L>And traver&s;es the &s;acred plain with ea&s;e.</L>
<L>But who is that &s;tands waiting at the gate?</L>
<L>To bid him welcome in? What heav'nly &s;tate</L>
<L>Attends that glorious per&s;on? O 'tis he;</L>
<L>My Lord, the glorious man that dy'd for me;</L>
<L>He comes to welcome in his &s;ervant, John!</L>
<L>He takes him by the hand, and &s;ays, WELL DONE.</L>
<L>"Well done thou good and faithful &s;ervant, come,</L>
<L>"Partake of glory, Heav'n is now thy home.</L>
<L>"Thou &s;halt obtain the plaudit of thy God,</L>

<L>Adoring low before him; while aloud,</L>
<L>All heav'n re&s;ounded with the Saviour's prai&s;e,</L>
<L>Who takes &s;uch plea&s;ure worms of earth to rai&s;e</L>
<L>To highe&s;t glories in the realms above;</L>
<L>He honours them who &s;hew, that "God is love,"</L>

<L>Who can inform me what tho&s;e triumphs mean?</L>
<L>Such crowds of &s;hining &s;pirits fly to meet,</L>
<L>This venerable man, and loudly greet,</L>

<L>The love of je&s;us was his darling theme,</L>
<L>Who &s;hed his blood for all, dy'd to redeem</L>
<L>The race of men, without excepting one,</L>
<L>Who were by &s;in, and by the Fall undone.</L>
<L>Nor can I here omit that herald bright,</L>
