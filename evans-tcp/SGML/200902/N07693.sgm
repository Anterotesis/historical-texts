<HEAD>SOME THOUGHTS ON CHRISTIANITY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE civility and frankne&s;s, which I could not help thinking carried &s;omething of friend&s;hip in it, with which you u&s;ed me, during our &s;hort acquaintaince, has kept me from for|forgeting you, &s;ince I &s;aw you; nor have I forgot the repeated reque&s;t you made me, before I left your place: Without hindering you then with apologies for my delay, I &s;hall now begin to an&s;wer it.</P>
<P>A Chri&s;tian, &s;ay we, in oppo&s;ition to all the various ways wherein men &s;eek to plea&s;e God, is per&s;uaded, upon divine authority, that GOD IS WELL PLEASED IN HIS BELOV|ED SON: This we are taught by the voice that came from heaven: This is the great point <HI>proved</HI> by the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us, as
<PB N="4" REF="009824_0003_0F7A5291278781C0">
being the point in di&s;pute before he died, upon which he was by the Jews condemned to death; and upon which both &s;ides ap|pealed to heaven for deci&s;ion. It was no part of the di&s;pute, whether Je&s;us, in cal|ling him&s;elf the SON OF GOD, &s;ignified him&s;elf to be truly and properly God. All parties concerned, friends and foes, were a|greed upon this: For under this title Je&s;us claimed equal honour with the Father; un|der this title the beliving Jews wor&s;hiped him, and a&s;cribed the divine perfections unto him, even at a time when nothing was more zealou&s;ly maintained among the Jews, than the wor&s;hiping of one God only. Upon his a&s;&s;uming this title, the unbelieving Jews ac|cu&s;ed him of bla&s;phemy; becau&s;e, &s;aid they, he being a man, maketh him&s;elf God: and in another place, becau&s;e he &s;aid, that God was his Father, making him&s;elf equal with God; while at the &s;ame time, however much they lay at the catch with his words, they never charged him with preaching up more gods than one. 'Tis too late now then to alter the meaning of that title. The only di&s;pute then was, whether that title belonged to Je&s;us; whether Je&s;us was the beloved Son of God, in whom he is well plea&s;ed. This is the plain meaning and import of that fact, the <HI>re&s;urrection of Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="009824_0004_0F7A5291B57D67B8">As Je&s;us came into the world not to &s;uf|fer for any &s;in of his own, being without &s;in, but, as he declares him&s;elf, to give his life a ran&s;om for many; &s;o God, in rai&s;ing him from the dead, gave the highe&s;t demon|&s;tration of his being well plea&s;ed with the ran&s;om which he gave: And as Je&s;us put the truth of all that he &s;aid, upon the i&s;&s;ue of his being rai&s;ed again from the dead, which you &s;ee his enemies al&s;o were appri&s;ed of; his re|&s;urrection, by this means, mu&s;t turn out to be the highe&s;t proof of the divine a&s;&s;ent to every thing he &s;poke.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Apo&s;tles, in pur&s;uance of their commi&s;&s;ion to preach that Go&s;pel, upon which eternal life hinged, every where bare witne&s;s to this fact, and made it their fir&s;t and chief bu&s;ine&s;s to per&s;uade men of it: and when they had got men per&s;uaded of it, their continual care about them was, that they might keep it in memory, (1 Cor. xv. 2. and 2 Tim. ii. 8.) and to &s;erve this great purpo&s;e were the various ob&s;ervances, which the A|po&s;tles delivered unto the churches to keep. This is the fir&s;t principle, the great axiom of Chri&s;tianity, from which we find the apo&s;tles continually inferring almo&s;t every thing that we are called to believe or do in the Chri&s;ti|an religion.</P>
<P>From <HI>this</HI> a Chri&s;tian draws his fir&s;t ta&s;te of that joy which is man's proper life in di|&s;tinction
<PB N="6" REF="009824_0005_0F7A529281CB2AE0">
from the brutes. This keeps him, like his pole &s;tar from groping in the dark, after every idle gue&s;s, &s;tarted by the wi&s;e and the learned, about virtue and happine&s;s. In|&s;tead of &s;eeking, like other men, to plea&s;e God by any qualification he has or hopes to attain, he is per&s;uaded that God is already well plea&s;ed in his beloved Son; that every thing needful to recommend him to the di|vine favour, was compleated by Je&s;us on the cro&s;s, when he &s;aid, <HI>It is fini&s;hed,</HI> and gave up the gho&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>This</HI> is the influencing principle, the lead|ing line of his life: This leads him to love God and keep his commandments. His mo|tives to his deads of greate&s;t &s;elf denial ari&s;e directly from <HI>this.</HI> His per&s;ua&s;ion, that the character of Je&s;us was &s;o amiable in the eye of God, as to procure his favour to the guil|ty, draws him to imitate that character; for 'tis plain, he that &s;ays he believes <HI>this,</HI> and does not make con&s;cience of imitating Je&s;us, tells a lie. A Chri&s;tian then is led in that path of virtue, which is in the highe&s;t repute with God; tho', as was examplified in Je&s;us, the true &s;tandard of it, it will never be the path to honor in this world. And he is moved forward by that principle, which of all others draws the heart of man with greate&s;t plea&s;ure, gratitude: So he toils not in the fruitle&s;s ta&s;k
<PB N="7" REF="009824_0006_0F7A5293397778B8">
of making out a title to the divine favour; but his obedience is a continued expre&s;&s;ion of thanks to God for the free gift of that righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, which he &s;ent his Son to work, and which he fini&s;hed on the cro&s;s, as a full title to the divine favour for the guiltie&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>This truth, believed on its proper evi|dence, gives &s;uch a da&s;h to the natural pride of his own under&s;tanding, that he can no more tru&s;t his rea&s;onings about God and hap|pine&s;s <HI>a priori;</HI> &s;o he learns his character of God, and his own &s;ituation with re&s;pect to him, wholly from this fact. This forms his judgment about mankind and about him&s;elf, alters his mind entirely as to every thing he formerly thought valuable about him&s;elf in the &s;ight of God, or gave him any prefe|rence to others in that repect; &s;o keeps him from looking upon any of mankind with an air importing, &s;tand by.</P>
<P>This directs him in the choice of his dear|e&s;t friends, and is the mea&s;ure and rule of his friend&s;hip with them: And, if he have friends in other repects, his fonder with in their behalf is, that they knew and believed this truth: He wi&s;hes, I &s;ay, for he knows he cannot per&s;uade, nor contribute any thing to the obtaining of his wi&s;h; even as he knows he did not contribute any thing him&s;elf to

his obtaining any comfortable apprehen&s;ion of this truth; yea, whatever pains might have been taken with him&s;elf, and however morally &s;erious he might formerly have been, he &s;ees plainly that the aim of his mind, in his mo&s;t &s;incere endeavours that way, lay in direct oppo&s;ition to the plain import of that f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct, which he now believes and finds happine&s;s in.</P>
<P>While I am &s;aving, that one man cannot per&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Chri&s;tian, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ible that I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> difficulty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> fully remove, as to hin|der you from objecting: Only at may be con|&s;ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, that, however plain the external evi|dence be, the fact is of &s;uch a nature, as to require more than human te&s;timony to give us a certain undoubting per&s;ua&s;ion of it. We can firmly rely upon human te&s;timony, as to events that fall out in the cour&s;e of na|ture: but as, in the re&s;urrection of the dead, the cour&s;e of nature is rever&s;ed; and as the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us is &s;o circum&s;tanced, as to decide a point of the highe&s;t importance and mo&s;t intere&s;ting nature, in oppo&s;ition to the rea&s;onings of all mankind; there is need in this ca&s;e for more than the te&s;timony of a|ny man, or &s;et of men, to re&s;t the firm per|&s;ua&s;ion of our minds upon: There is need here for divine te&s;timony, divine evidence, to
<PB N="9" REF="009824_0008_0F7A5294EF0431A0">
our belief. For as to what kind of credit the&s;e people may give to it, to whom it is a matter of no moment whether it be true or not, I have no occa&s;ion to take notice of that here. And if we rate the believers of this fact on its proper evidence, by their appearing well affected to the plain &s;imple &s;cripture meaning of it, their numbers will turn out to be but &s;mall, and rarely to be found in the Chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P>If you enquire, what is the nature of this divine evidence? I an&s;wer, fir&s;t, it is very &s;imple and forcible, as all the ways whereby God corre&s;ponds with men are: For in&s;tance, when one retires a moment, and ca&s;ts his eyes round upon the magnificent frame of the hea|vens and the earth, his mind is &s;truck with an awful apprehen&s;ion of a grand contriver, the great Creator and former of all things: &s;o, with re&s;pect to the &s;cripture account of the re&s;ur|rection of Je&s;us, when one perceives the divine evidence of it, his mind is &s;truck with a view of &s;uch a grand contrivance, that he is con|vinced none but God could be the author of it. But more particularly:</P>
<P>When man, who is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the brutes by his con&s;cience, and who&s;e proper life lies in a &s;en&s;e of God's fovour, allows him|&s;elf an interval from tho&s;e functions that are common to him with other animals, and acts
<PB N="10" REF="009824_0009_0F7A5295DFA26F38">
in his di&s;tingui&s;hed character, examining how matters &s;tand betwixt his creator and him; his con&s;cience mu&s;t be convinced that God is an infinitely good being, &s;o as oppo&s;ite to all evil as he is good; of which the pain that ari&s;es in the mind of man, when he does evil, is a &s;trong proof. This pain is man's proper death, which he &s;huns more than all other evils. The more he thinks on God, his pain encrea&s;es. When he looks abroad upon the inflexible oppo&s;ition of the Almighty to all &s;in, he mu&s;t conclude, &s;eeing the Almighty is again&s;t me, who can be for me? All the creation cannot help here! He is &s;urrounded with impo&s;&s;ibilities on all hands as to any way of relief: He finds him&s;elf mortally wounded by the &s;troke of the Almighty, and &s;o, in|curable by any inferior hand. He is torment|ed with the impo&s;&s;ibility he finds of an&s;wer|ing that que&s;tion, How &s;hall God be plea&s;|ed?</P>
<P>That beam of divine wi&s;dom, which &s;hines in man's con&s;cience, di&s;covering his &s;in, is the very kindler of his mi&s;ery; and that pow|er which gave m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n his being and proper life, appears armed for his ruin: For &s;urely no pow|er but that of God can hurt a life that lies in his favour: So divine <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and divine <HI>pow|er</HI> &s;tand the <HI>objectors.</HI> Therefore,</P>
<P>That <HI>an&s;wer,</HI> which can fairly &s;atisfy and heal the mind of man, thus pained and wound|ed,
<PB N="11" REF="009824_0010_0F7A52965DA2CEA8">
without dimini&s;hing in the lea&s;t his aw|ful conviction of God's inflexible oppo&s;ition to &s;in, mu&s;t, in the nature of the thing, car|ry its own evidence of coming from the infinitely good, wi&s;e and powerful Being; who created man, &s;peaks in his con&s;cience, made his life to lie in his favour; &s;o could a|lone deprive him of that life, and alone re|&s;tore it to him when lo&s;t. Such an <HI>an&s;wer</HI> mu&s;t contain a new di&s;play of divine <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>power;</HI> for, &s;eeing the&s;e form the wound|ing objection, &s;urely no inferior wi&s;dom or power can provide the healing an&s;wer: and the wi&s;dom and power di&s;played in this heal|ing an&s;wer, mu&s;t appear as vehement for goodne&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and again&s;t &s;in, as formerly; that it may be manife&s;t they are the wi&s;dom and power of that infinitely good Being, who appears, in the wounded con&s;cience, infinitely oppo&s;ite to all evil, ma|lignity, or &s;in. So,</P>
<P>While I repre&s;ent divine wi&s;dom and pow|er as objecting again&s;t &s;inful man's happine&s;s, and again providing a full &s;atisfying an&s;wer to the objection, you mu&s;t not think that I point out the&s;e divine perfections as in the lea&s;t variable, or not perfe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly uniform: No, for the an&s;wer mu&s;t fully remove the founda|tion for the objection; it mu&s;t &s;hew that &s;in is taken away, by the full expre&s;&s;ion of God's inflexible oppo&s;ition to it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="009824_0011_0F7A52971450E1C8">Now, this is the very ca&s;e with the go&s;pel: The go&s;pel contains all that can be wi&s;hed for in &s;uch an healing an&s;wer, to great advan|tage, and that by means which it could ne|ver have entered into the heart of man, or of any creature to devi&s;e; and which manife&s;t a power not inferior to that which command|ed the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, and cal|led the world into being from nothing: So the go&s;pel is the wi&s;dom and the power of God, to &s;ave every one who believes it. It &s;ets before us the inflexible oppo&s;ition of the Almighty to all &s;in, fully expre&s;&s;ed in the death of Chri&s;t: &s;o, to u&s;e the &s;cripture words, the <HI>an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience towards God,</HI> is <HI>by the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is gone into Heaven and is on the right hand of God.</HI> Here the character of the true God &s;hines forth before the eyes of a &s;inner, thus de&s;cribed in his own words, <HI>See now that I, even I am he, and there is no God with me; I kill and I make alive, I wound and I heal, neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.</HI> And in another place, <HI>They have no knowledge, that &s;et up&mdash;and pray unto a God that cannot &s;ave&mdash;there is no God be&s;ide me, a ju&s;t God and a Saviour, there is none be&s;ide me; look unto me and be ye &s;aved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and there is none el&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="009824_0012_0F7A5297C84785A8">But further, to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity there is for &s;ome &s;uch evidence as I have been &s;peaking of it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that when a man's mind is heartily pinched upon a que&s;tion, that lies wholly betwixt God and his own con&s;ci|ence, he then finds he needs &s;omething to be &s;aid on the part of God to ea&s;e his mind; &s;ome|thing of greater authority and weight than the be&s;t connected chain of philo&s;ophic rea|&s;oning, or the mo&s;t authentic tradition: And it cannot be denied, that God may &s;o &s;hew him&s;elf in what he &s;ays, as fully to con|vince the hearer, that it is he that &s;peaks; and &s;uch a conviction the hearers of the a|po&s;tles had, 1 The&s;&s;. ii. 14. So much then for the nature of the Chri&s;tian truth, and its peculiar evidence.</P>
<P>But the great difficulty &s;till remains: If this evidence lies quite plain and open in the bible before every one that reads or hears it, why does not every one perceive it? why cannot one man lay it &s;o before another, as to make it &s;trike him, as he may a propo&s;ition of Eu|clid?</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this, I &s;atisfy my&s;elf by &s;ay|ing, that as this truth as recorded in the bible, carrying its peculiar evidence along with it, pre&s;ents a new idea of God, which our minds by their original con&s;titution were not framed to take in; and which man, if he had re|tained
<PB N="14" REF="009824_0013_0F7A5298823F41A0">
his righteou&s;ne&s;s, could have no occa|&s;ion for; it is therefore nece&s;&s;ary that that &s;ame power, which at fir&s;t framed the mind of man for taking in its <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> ideas, &s;hould put hand to it afre&s;h, and make it capable of admitting this <HI>new</HI> one; which, in &s;hort, is this, God con&s;tituting and making a &s;inner a righteous per&s;on, as nece&s;&s;ary to the enjoying his favour and eternal life, and yet appearing perfectly ju&s;t in doing &s;o.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e you will think now, that by at|tempting to get out of one difficutty, I have fallen into a greater. You will &s;ay, at this rate, man is, by his very con&s;titution led to reject the go&s;pel: And this is indeed what I affirm. For man, by his original con&s;titution, was made to live by his own righteou&s;ne&s;s; and while he retained this, his con&s;titution was certainly well &s;uited to his happine&s;s, and he then could have no occa&s;ion for any &s;uch thing as the go&s;pel: So his natural idea of God could be no other but this, that he is ju&s;t in ju&s;tifying the righteous, and in condemning the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or. And while he &s;tood righte|ous, he co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld look upon the ju&s;t God as his friend. But this idea of God can yield no comfort to a &s;inner: For, &s;eeing none but the righteous can enjoy the friend&s;hip of the ju&s;t God; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;inner can ever hope for that enjoyment, ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l he know how God can be

ju&s;t in ju&s;tifying the ungodly, or making them righteous; &s;o fit for that enjoyment. But this new idea of God cannot be had from nature, but from the go&s;pel; where God makes a new di&s;covery of him&s;elf, acting above and beyond the &s;phere of nature altogether; yea rever&s;ing the cour&s;e thereof, rai&s;ing the dead, and calling tho&s;e things that be not, as though they were.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e one &s;hould be educated from a child, and promoted by a great and wealthy trading company to be their principal mana|ger and tru&s;tee with a pen&s;ion of &s;ome thou|&s;ands a year: and after he has lived many years &s;plendidly in this office, he &s;hould at length forfeit all his wealth and his honor with the company, by gro&s;s unfaithfulne&s;s to his tru&s;t: would not his remaining ta&s;te for that honorable high life, which he had &s;o long held by his integrity, make it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for him to beg, or even to ex&s;pect &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by alms from any of the company? would he not rather chu&s;e to make any kind of &s;hift for him&s;elf in &s;ome remote place, where he &s;hould never be &s;een by any of them? This &s;imilitude may &s;erve to &s;ignify, tho' indeed very imperfectly, the natural e|&s;trangment of &s;inful man's heart from God; and the &s;trong bia&s;s which his orignal con&s;ti|tution mu&s;t give him again&s;t the go&s;pel.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="009824_0015_0F7A529A467DE550">When man became a &s;inner, his natural propen&s;ity to live by his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which he had now lo&s;t, and could by no means repair, behoved to be criminal, as it leads him to think &s;o di&s;honorably of God, as to imagine that he can be plea&s;ed with an imperfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, or a righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;tained with &s;in; whereas his original appre|hen&s;ion of God behoved to be, that he could be plea&s;ed with nothing &s;hort of pefect &s;in|le&s;s obedience; of which he &s;oon had an awful proof, in God's condemning all mankind to death for one &s;ingle tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and that not of what is commonly called a moral, but of a po&s;itive precept. To the &s;ame purpo&s;e we may yet find another abiding te&s;timony among mankind, from the pain that ari&s;es in the mind of a man upon the commi&s;&s;ion of one &s;ingle &s;in; and from the &s;u&s;picious fear, which haunts tho&s;e who have the be&s;t cha|racters among men, when they &s;eriou&s;ly think of their &s;ituation with re&s;pect to God, that &s;omething more than they have yet done is needful to plea&s;e him: A remarkable in&s;tance of which you have in that young gentleman, of a mo&s;t amiable character among men; who, with regard to the laws that re&s;pect human &s;ociety, could &s;ay, <HI>All the&s;e things have I keept from my youth up:</HI> yet, when he &s;eriou&s;ly thought of eternal life, this natural

que&s;tion pained his mind, <HI>What good thing &s;hall I do to obtain it? What lack I yet?</HI> As this que&s;tion &s;hews the language of con&s;cience, &s;o it &s;hews al&s;o the natural propen&s;ity above|mentioned; which, after ever &s;o many fruit|le&s;s attempts, &s;till &s;ets a man to work afre&s;h, to &s;eek life by &s;omething that he him&s;elf is to do.

and cemented together by this in&s;tinct. And indeed I look upon it as the great &s;tanding &s;ign, appearance, or vi&s;ible repre&s;entation of the union &s;poken of in the 17th ch. of John, and accordingly one of the principle eviden|ces, if not the mo&s;t &s;triking proof of the truth of Chri&s;tianity: This is plainly intimated twice in that chapter; fir&s;t in ver. 21. <HI>That they all may be one, &amp;c. that the world may believe that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me:</HI> And then in ver. 23. <HI>That they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me.</HI> The Chri&s;tian unanimity corre&s;ponds to the New Te&s;tament, as a map does to the geographical grammar, and the appearance of it is one great thing that gives meaning and force to the preached go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I cannot well conclude without taking no|tice of another grand ob&s;tacle, which the go&s;pel has to overcome, in finding its way into the heart of man, and which is as firmly rooted in our con&s;titution as the former, and &s;tands in the clo&s;e&s;t connection with it; and that is, the appetite for an earthly paradi&s;e, &s;omething like what man originally enjoyed as the proper re|ward of his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which his bo|dy was fitted for, and which he forfeited by his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. It is true, man's proper life was a &s;en&s;e of God's favour; yet it was in the&s;e delightful enjoyments, prepared for
<PB N="28" REF="009824_0027_0F7A52A2EDC5CDD0">
him in paradi&s;e, that he experienced that fa|vour: The divine &s;mile upon his food and o|ther earthly enjoyments, gave them that pecu|liar exqui&s;ite reli&s;h, which other animals, not having his peculiar ta&s;te, could not find in the like. And tho' man has long &s;ince lo&s;t both his righteou&s;ne&s;s and paradi&s;e together, yet in &s;inful mi&s;erable man, the di&s;po&s;ion &s;till re|mains to join &s;ome &s;hadow of both the&s;e to|gether. How bewitchingly are the &s;tories of virtue rewarded dre&s;t up before our eyes? and the virtues chiefly recommended to us, and extolled by our wi&s;e men, are &s;uch as either aim at, or &s;hine be&s;t in what is called high Life; &s;o we are told, <HI>virtutibus ob&s;tat res an|gu&s;ta domi.</HI></P>
<P>Now the go&s;pel does not &s;et before us the pro&s;pect of being re-in&s;tated into &s;uch an earthly happine&s;s as man once held by his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, but a much more glorious life, the proper reward of the Son of God, for his humbling him&s;elf and becoming obedient un|to the death; a &s;piritual and heavenly life, to take place by a re&s;urrection from the dead: And in order to the full enjoyment of which, the con&s;titution of man mu&s;t be changed, and whereof he can only have the hope and foreta&s;te to comfort him&s;elf with in his mor|tal &s;tate: So the virtues, by which the go&s;|pel calls true Chri&s;tians to be chiefly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed,

<P>It mu&s;t likewi&s;e be con&s;idered, that this happine&s;s, this new life from the dead, is of &s;uch a nature as eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to form a conception of it. We have no principles in our minds, nor any thing that affects our &s;en&s;es to draw a compari&s;on from, by which we can frame any idea of it. For, however delicately a man may imagine about happine&s;s, and however high he may rai&s;e his idea of it: &s;till his mo&s;t ab&s;tracted thoughts will never ri&s;e higher than &s;ome refinement upon earthly bli&s;s.

<HEAD>THE CONVERSION OF JONATHAN THE JEW, As related by him&s;elf.</HEAD>
<P>_HAD Je&s;us, when buried like other mortals, remained in the grave, I had &s;tedfa&s;tly adhered to the Pha|ri&s;ees, and gloried in being one of them, as being convinced, that the grand controver&s;y about righteou&s;ne&s;s, which was carried on with great zeal on both &s;ides, was now fairly decided in their favour, and that they had gained an aditional honor by the oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I received a liberal and virtuous education among the Sadducees, who admit no &s;en&s;e of our &s;acred writings but what they think agreeable to &s;ound philo&s;ophy. But happen|ing, about the time that Je&s;us made his ap|pearance, to fall acquainted with &s;ome ami|able

men of eminent piety among the Phari|&s;ees, I began to conceive a liking to their party. I ob&s;erved, that they maintained a more &s;trict temperance, and, in general, a greater purity of life, and that they had more exalted &s;entiments about the power and cha+racter of God, than the other party. I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s now to attend their lectures, and &s;tudy their tenets, in hopes of being found worthy to rank with them. Mean time, the uncommon oppo&s;ition &s;hewn to them by Je&s;us drew no &s;mall &s;hare of my attention, and &s;erved, on the whole, rather to increa&s;e than dimini&s;h my attachment to them. I con&s;idered their &s;entiments as a great im|provement of my former way of thinking, and highly conducive to my advancement in virtue as well as piety. I readily judged, then, that the oppo&s;ition which was chiefly pointed again&s;t what came neare&s;t to perfec|tion, behoved to flow from the wor&s;t of cau&s;es.</P>
<P>I had a very low opinion of Je&s;us, as well as of the company he kept, on many accounts, which I &s;hall not now take time to relate.

&s;ome of my friends in authority, with the malevolent purpo&s;e I have ju&s;t now mention|ed &mdash; But &s;uch was their reply, that I think I &s;hall never forget it!

And all this they &s;hewed with the greate&s;t &s;implicity and clearne&s;s, to be the plain meaning and import of the fact which they te&s;tifyed, even the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us. And they confirmed every thing they &s;aid, by the unanimous voice of the prophets, whom I had never under&s;tood till now.

And it well corre&s;ponded thereto in its effects: for it proved &s;ufficient to rai&s;e the dead, and give hope to the de&s;perate.&mdash;The fact and its import, the <HI>hand-writing</HI> and the <HI>interpretation,</HI> equally became the maje&s;ty of him who is the <HI>Supreme.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;aw plainly, that in the re&s;urrection of Je|&s;us, there behoved to be the agency of a <HI>power</HI> &s;uperior to the power of nature, even capa|ble to controul and rever&s;e the cour&s;e there|of: therefore I concluded, that this operat|ing <HI>power</HI> was greater than the God of the Sadducees and the philo&s;ophers.

I found, by the deci&s;ion, that its charac|ter was more grand and perfect, as well as its agency &s;tronger, than that of the God of the Phari&s;ees. As to its agency, it was able to rai&s;e from deeper mi&s;ery to higher ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s than the Phari&s;ees thought of. As to its character, it appeared with unlimited &s;overeignty <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>merciful</HI> in perfection. Whereas the God of the Phari&s;ees was &s;uch onl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> partially, and by halves; incapable to execute the threatened cur&s;e again&s;t every &s;in, and yet &s;hew mercy and boundle&s;s favour to the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, not &s;o ju&s;t as to maintain the honor, the &s;pirit, and extent of the perfect law, at all events; nor &s;o merciful, as to have

any favour for the uttetly worthle&s;s and wretched: but, halving the matter, merciful to men of good repute, and ju&s;t in accepting tho&s;e who are deficient in their righteou&s;|ne&s;s; or, in another view, ju&s;t in exacting the debt of five hundred pence, and merci|ful in forgiving that of fifty; or &s;hewing ju|&s;tice only again&s;t the utterly in&s;olvent, and mercy only to tho&s;e who can make partial payment;&mdash;in &s;hort, (like all created poten|tates), incapable of appearing, at once, with|out limitation of either attribute, ju&s;t and mer|ciful in perfection.</P>
<P>I found then that the power which operat|ed in the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us, excelled not only in &s;trength, but al&s;o in maje&s;ty and per|fection of character, all that was called God among men. So I perceived no &s;mall propri|ety in the &s;aying of Je&s;us, <HI>O righteous father, the world hath not known thee.</HI>&mdash;I concluded then that this <HI>power</HI> is the only true God: for that which is <HI>greate&s;t</HI> mu&s;t be God.

For to &s;uppo&s;e, that the bare notion or idea of ought greater than God could ever be any where imagined, would be the wilde&s;t of all ab&s;urdities.
