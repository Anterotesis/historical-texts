<L>_DESCEND, <HI>Urania,</HI> and in&s;pire my ver&s;e,</L>
<L>I rai&s;e my &s;ong to &s;ing your kindred &s;tars;</L>
<L>I aim to rove where glitt'ring comets &s;tray,</L>
<L>Trace the bright wand'rers thro' th' Ae|therial way,</L>
<L>And all around th' Almighty's pow'r proclaim,</L>
<L>Where worlds can roll, or &s;uns ince&s;&s;ant flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See! heav'nly mu&s;e, view with attentive eyes,</L>
<L>The ruddy wonder of the ev'ning &s;kies!</L>
<L>From &s;tar, to &s;tar, the burning ruin rolls,</L>
<L>Beams thro' the Aether, and alarms the poles:</L>
<L>Around the earth the wond'ring nations gaze,</L>
<L>On the dire terrors of the lengthen'd blaze,</L>
<L>While, trailing on, they dream its &s;parkling hair,</L>
<L>Shakes famine, earthquake, pe&s;tilence and war:</L>
<L>Illu&s;ions vain! remote from human things,</L>
<L>Where other planets roll in other rings</L>
<L>It travels va&s;t; and all around proclaims</L>
<L>A world in chaos, or an earth in flames.</L>

<L>So, thro' the Aether, &s;wept the ancient earth,</L>
<L>Ere time, and form, and beauty fir&s;t had birth,</L>
<L>Un&s;hap'd and void, thro' &s;pace immen&s;e it roam'd,</L>
<L>Till &s;poke the GOD&mdash;and <HI>Eden</HI> in&s;tant bloom'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What ruin! what confu&s;ion might be hurl'd,</L>
<L>By &s;uch a ball, upon our guilty world?</L>
<L>Witne&s;s, ye waves, which in the deluge &s;pread,</L>
<L>Whelm'd o'er the earth, and &s;tretch'd the nations dead.</L>
<L>Down heav'n's high &s;teep, wide-&s;pread the &s;teaming train</L>
<L>Ru&s;h'd on the fields, and pour'd the floods of rain;</L>
<L>The dark aby&s;s, attracted into day,</L>
<L>Gu&s;h'd o'er the mountain-tops, and ror'd away;</L>
<L>The to&s;t ark, tott'ring, thro' its fabrick &s;hook,</L>

<L>When fre&s;h in&s;pir'd, and fervid from the &s;un,</L>
<L>The flagrant Stranger &s;hapes a diff'rent path,</L>
<L>And from its annual orbit drags the earth.</L>
<L>Ye fancy, mortals! di&s;tant as ye are,</L>
<L>All calm and placid round the &s;ailing &s;tar,</L>

In gentle rays &s;erenely gleams the head,</L>
<L>And ea&s;y lu&s;ter thro' the train is &s;pread:</L>
<L>Ah, ye perceive not what loud tumult reigns</L>
<L>Thro' the hot regions of its wild domains;</L>
<L>What hideous thunder the wide Aether &s;hocks,</L>
<L>Of tumbling mountains, and of cra&s;hing rocks:</L>
<L>Fierce &s;eas of flame beat round the burning &s;hores,</L>
<L>And ev'ry tempe&s;t raves, and every furnace rores.</L>
<L>To this devoted earth it marches on,</L>
<L>And midnight blazes with the glare of noon;</L>
<L>Big, and more big, it arches all the air,</L>
<L>A vault of fluid Bra&s;s the &s;kies appear:</L>
<L>From their foundations, where they ancient &s;tood,</L>
<L>Down ru&s;h the mountains in a flaming flood;</L>
<L>The min'rals pour their melted bowels out,</L>
<L>The rocks run down, the flying rivers &s;pout;</L>
<L>The earth di&s;olves thro' its disjointed frame,</L>
<L>Its clouds all lighten, and its <HI>Aetna's</HI> flame;</L>
<L>The &s;ea exhales, and in long volumes hurl'd,</L>
<L>Follows the wand'ring globe from world to world;</L>
<L>Now at the &s;un it glows, now &s;teers its flight</L>
<L>Thro' the cold de&s;arts of eternal night,</L>
<L>Warns every creature thro' its trackle&s;s road,</L>
<L>The fate of &s;inners, and the wrath of GOD.</L>
