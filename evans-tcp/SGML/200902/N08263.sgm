<HEAD>The Introduction, containing a brief View of the pre&s;ent State of the Pro|te&s;tant World; with &s;ome particular <HI>Remarks</HI> on the Writings of Mr. <HI>San|deman.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_WHEN men &s;ee a new book, 'tis natural for them to enquire the occa&s;ion of its appearance, e&s;pecially now when the world is &s;o full of them. The reque&s;t of friends is a common excu&s;e, and may truly be alledged here; yet that is not the chief motive. And what encouragement can the pre&s;ent face of things give to &s;uch a work as this? For the language of book&s;ellers in our country for &s;ome years has born a near re&s;emblance to that of one de&s;cribed in the <HI>London</HI> Magazine for <HI>April</HI> 1763. Who re|fu&s;ed to print a poem, becau&s;e the &s;ubject was too moral and religious; and &s;aid,
<Q><L>"Had your poem been garni&s;h'd with modi&s;h chit chat,</L>
<L>How Fanny &s;aid this, and how Cloe did that;</L>
<L>Lac'd with baudry and &s;mut, had you publi&s;h'd a play,</L>
<L>I could &s;ell off two thou&s;and at lea&s;t the fir&s;t day.</L>
<L>For whate'er you may fancy, you live in an age,</L>
<L>When the church do not pay half &s;o well as the &s;tage;</L>
<L>Dear Doctor, tho' &s;kill'd both in Hebrew and Greek,</L>
<L>You had much better preach for five Shillings a week</L>
<L>Than publi&s;h &s;uch ver&s;e&mdash;for whatever is in't,</L>
<L>If <HI>&s;erious,</HI> it ne'er pays for paper and print".</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="010549_0004_0F806BB8F52A88E0">Yet (&s;trange as it may &s;eem) a heart affecting view of this deep &s;leep which we are fallen into, is the principle motive to this attempt, towards &s;tiring &s;ouls up to a living and practical regard to divine truth: The neglect whereof has brought this lethergy upon us. And while it was coming on, various things have diverted our minds from a &s;en&s;e of our danger. Some|times our thoughts were prying into <HI>futurities,</HI> to the neglect of <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> living unto God; and then every thing that could be met with of a <HI>prophetical</HI> nature was pub|li&s;hed and &s;pread: Not only &s;uch as were &s;erious cal|culations or conjectures from &s;cripture, but al&s;o ro|mantic vi&s;ions and dreams. At other times, witty or angry <HI>controver&s;y</HI> employed our minds in various &s;hapes: yea, in&s;tead of living by faith as we ought, many have contended (as hard as <HI>Job</HI> and his friends did) about what <HI>faith is.</HI></P>
<P>And I believe <HI>coun&s;el</HI> has been <HI>darkned with words without knowledge,</HI> as much in <HI>this</HI> controver&s;y as in <HI>that.</HI> As long as <HI>Job</HI> view'd God in all that befel him, he did not <HI>&s;in with his lips;</HI> but when he tur|ned to di&s;pute with his friends, each party mi&s;applied excellent truths, and retorted their mi&s;taken conclu&s;i|ons till their &s;pirits were wearied out: yet when the Lord appeared he made them all a&s;ham'd of their conduct; and doubtle&s;s his appearance now would have the &s;ame effect upon &s;ome of our late di&s;putants. The neglect of right conduct in many who have made great profe&s;&s;ions of faith, has given occa&s;ion for the builders on works to exert them&s;elves afre&s;h; and the writings of a religious nature which have had the mo&s;t current &s;pread in this land for &s;ome years pa&s;t, were &s;uch as, under a pretence of promoting morality and good order, have been levelled again&s;t many of the
<PB N="7" REF="010549_0005_0F806BBB2EA8BF78">
peculiar doctrines of chri&s;tianity; yea &s;ome of them even again&s;t the true deity of its great author.</P>
<P>In the mean time we have one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Robert Sandeman,</HI> who came from <HI>Scotland</HI> in autumn 1764. and after travelling into various parts of the coun|try he gathered a church at <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> but that was &s;cattered la&s;t fall, and he has a &s;mall &s;ociety now in <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></NOTE> who makes a &s;hew of appearing for tho&s;e great doctrines, and to &s;tir people up to look into them, that yet has artfully mixed &s;uch a <HI>potion,</HI> as tends to &s;ettle men in a dead &s;leep. And &s;ince his writings have been a means of hardning ma|ny in iniquity, and of entangling or perplexing &s;ome &s;erious minds, I &s;hall attempt to point out &s;ome per|nicious principles, which he has inter&s;per&s;ed among many choice truths.</P>
<P>He has &s;et down a charming de&s;cription, of the Apo&s;tle's manner of preaching in the&s;e terms, viz. <Q>As they exhibit no allurements to the pa&s;&s;ions of men; &s;o neither do they enter into any parly of capi|tulation with his pre&s;umptuous rea&s;onings; but &s;torming and demoli&s;hing the&s;e, they pre&s;s forward to his con&s;cience, charge him before God, and con|ver&s;e with him there. They clear up, and pre&s;ent in a &s;triking view before him, the half defaced rea|&s;ons of duty, naturally imprinted in his heart, and &s;hew at once, how un&s;utable to them his thoughts and actions have been. They un&s;hakle his con|&s;cience, and make it &s;peak out, and, with the high|e&s;t demon&s;tration, enforce every thing it &s;peaks. And while they &s;hut up all his imagined &s;ources of light and hope, they furni&s;h him with a &s;upernatural rea&s;on of hope &s;tamped with the divine character.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letters on Theron and A&s;pacio 3 Editon Vol I. page 226.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="010549_0006_0F806BBBC1EF21E8">Such fine pa&s;&s;ages as this, will induce &s;ome to take down all that &s;uch a writer &s;ays, almo&s;t wishout exami|nation. But if we ob&s;erve the divine caution, <HI>Take heed what you hear,</HI> we may &s;oon find things of ano|ther nature; for the Apo&s;tles are dead, and this writer has rai&s;ed a &s;tately monument for them, and in&s;cribed thereon, PAUL'S GOSPEL. And now he will not allow any man to call him&s;elf Chri&s;t's <HI>amba&s;&s;ador,</HI> and to <HI>be&s;eech</HI> &s;ouls in <HI>Chri&s;t's &s;tead to be reconciled to God:</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.20.</NOTE> and for no better rea&s;on that I can find than this, viz. that many have abu&s;ed that character &s;ince the Apo&s;tle's days. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Letters Vol. I. page 45. &amp;c.</NOTE> Therefore now when one mini&s;ter &s;ays to his hearers, <Q>Let me tell you, the Lord hath &s;ent me at this time to <HI>proclaim liberty to the captives</HI> that are in this &s;ad, bitter, and (to their thinking) de&s;perate condition; liberty God hath given thee, if thou wilt come freely; nothing in the world &s;hall hinder thee.</Q> This author &s;ays that in this pa&s;&s;age, "His lofty &s;elf conceit may be &s;een". And when another mini&s;ter expo&s;tulates with his hearers thus, <Q>Can none of my exhortations, none of my friendly intreaties prevail with you to <HI>rou&s;e up,</HI> and look into your own hearts, and exa|mine your &s;tate and condition</Q> &amp;c. This man cries <Q>ob&s;erve with what dignity this gentleman <HI>&s;truts</HI> in his pulpit.</Q> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Letters Vol. 2. page 203, 204, 208.</NOTE> And he concludes his book with this advice to his readers, viz. <Q>After you have heard the orthodox &s;o plainly affirming, that ju&s;tification is an act of God's free grace,&mdash;&s;uffer them not to put the change upon you. Whenever they begin to talk to you of any act you are to exert in order
<PB N="9" REF="010549_0007_0F806BBC54681B18">
to acceptance, and call it a ju&s;tifying act, which you are to exert by the help of God's grace, be you ready to reply, Avaunt; none of your tricks! If you would preach go&s;pel to us, you mu&s;t tell us &s;omething fit to give us joy as we pre&s;ently &s;tand uncon&s;cious of any di&s;tingui&s;hing qualifica|tion.</Q></P>
<P>Here reader, only look back to his de&s;cription of the Apo&s;tle's way of preaching the go&s;pel, and judge for thy&s;elf, if he does not teach &s;inners to <HI>gain&s;ay</HI> ju&s;t &s;uch preaching now as they delivered, when they <Q>pre&s;|&s;ed forward to the &s;inners con&s;cience, charged him before God, and conver&s;ed with him there; and &s;hut up all his imagined &s;ources of light and hope</Q> while they called him to <HI>believe in the Lord Je&s;us and ye &s;hall he &s;aved:</HI> yea he teacheth them to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch preachers now as they would the devil, by crying, "Avaunt! none of your tricks"!</P>
<P>It is readily granted that this writer has pointed out many dark &s;trokes in the writings of our mo&s;t noted divines; and if he could clear off all their mi&s;|takes, he &s;hould be as welcome thereto, as any <HI>crow</HI> could be to take all the <HI>carrion</HI> out of our plea&s;ant fields; but who would abandon their fruitful fields, becau&s;e &s;ome crow's meat was found there? Yet he bends all his wit this way; for after naming Mr. <HI>Flavel,</HI> the <HI>Er&s;kine's</HI> and many others, under the name of <HI>popular preachers,</HI> he &s;ays, <Q>I would be far from refu&s;ing even to the popular preachers them&s;elves, what they &s;o much grudge to others, the benefit of the one in&s;tance of an hardned &s;inner finding mercy at la&s;t: For I know of no &s;inners more hardened, none greater de&s;troyers of mankind than

they.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters on Theron &amp;c.

Vol. 2 page 194.</NOTE></Q> Now compare this with what he &s;ays of others: <Q>Many, &s;ays he, tru&s;ting in them&s;elves, that they are more eminently godly than others, look down with a &s;olemn pride on the re&s;t of mankind.&mdash;Many have their pride not a little gratified, by <HI>complaining</HI> of the <HI>defections</HI> of the church whereof they are members.</Q> Yet there is &s;carce one <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> author that he names without <HI>complaining</HI> of his <HI>defections;</HI> and where he could find nothing to <HI>complain</HI> of, he conceals their names; for he &s;ays, <Q>I have as I found occa&s;ion, freely adopted the ob&s;ervations, and even the words of the friends of the doctrine contained in the&s;e &s;heets, without &s;eeing any nece&s;&s;ity of quoting them
<PB N="11" REF="010549_0009_0F806BBD80B15E40">
or mentioning their names.</Q> But why not their names on one &s;ide as well as the other? Why he &s;ays <Q>There was no attacking the popular doctrine to any purpo&s;e, without making an <HI>hone&s;t</HI> e&s;&s;ay to|wards profaning the divinity of tho&s;e demi-gods<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters Vol. 2 page 245, 246.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Now my dear friends, behold! this man is &s;o <HI>hum|ble</HI> that he exclaims aloud again&s;t every bodies <HI>pride</HI> but <HI>his own!</HI> and he is &s;o <HI>hone&s;t</HI> that he exerts all his wit to expo&s;e the <HI>nakedne&s;s</HI> of <HI>prote&s;tant fathers;</HI> but adopts their <HI>good ob&s;ervations,</HI> while he conceals their names that they may pa&s;s for his own!</P>
<P>Yet he would not have us think that he is moved to this conduct by the <HI>prejudices</HI> of <HI>education;</HI> becau&s;e he tells us he was trained up from his infancy under &s;uch teaching, and long &s;ought to form his heart thereby: <Q>But, &s;ays he I am far from thinking I &s;ay any thing extravagant, or in the lea&s;t injurious to my con&s;cience, when I affirm, that I might have been as profitably employed, and even with as much chri&s;tian piety, in attending the levee of the lady of Loretto.</Q> Vol. 1 page 121.</P>
<P>Here ob&s;erve, <HI>Loretto</HI> is a city in <HI>Italy,</HI> where <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> &s;ay they have the <HI>holy hou&s;e</HI> that the virgin <HI>Mary</HI> was born in, which they pretend was carried through the air from <HI>Gallilee</HI> by angels:&mdash; therefore many thou&s;ands yearly re&s;ort there, to pay their devotions to the <HI>Ladies</HI> image, with the infant on her arm. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Univer&s;al Gazeteer at the word Lorotto.</NOTE> So that he had as good have &s;aid, <Q>There is are profitable means to promote chri&s;tian piety in attending the wor&s;hip of the virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> in the depths of <HI>popery,</HI> as there are under &s;uch tea|chers as Mr. <HI>Boston,</HI> the <HI>Er&s;kins</HI>'s &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="010549_0010_0F806BBE4E6C2F38">Let this be kept in mind, and we will turn and enquire what more profitable means are to be had under his teaching.

<P>In order to e&s;tabli&s;h his notion of the&s;e two ca&s;es, he puts a fal&s;e con&s;truction upon others &s;entiments concerning them. As to the fir&s;t, he &s;peaks of &s;ome <HI>di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and afterwards of Dr. <HI>Gill</HI> by name, whom he repre&s;ents as holding that adult per&s;ons are intitu|led to bapti&s;m, and &s;o to the kingdom of Heaven on account of &s;omething which they <HI>can do</HI> more than infants towards <HI>obtaining</HI> a part therein. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Letters Vol. 2 page 41 205.</NOTE> Whereas that controver&s;y is not concerning what any can do towards <HI>obtaining,</HI> but 'tis about <HI>manife&s;ting</HI> their in|tere&s;t in the kingdom. We have no account who the parents of them children were which were brought to Je&s;us, <HI>Mat.</HI> 19.13, 14. Neither does

he &s;ay <HI>all &s;uch,</HI> but <HI>of &s;uch</HI> is the kingdom of Hea|ven. Mr. <HI>S.</HI> holds that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;tolory Core&s;pond. page 30.</NOTE> <Q>ju&s;tification comes to a parent, and his hou&s;e at the &s;ame time; and &s;ays, The parent then believing, according to what is &s;poken, is ju&s;tified together with his hou&s;e.</Q> If this were true, it would prove that parents <HI>can do</HI> a great deal for others, if not for them&s;elves. The text he refers to for the &s;upport of this notion, a&s;&s;erts fully that the <HI>word</HI> was <HI>&s;poken to all that were in</HI> the jailor's hou&s;e, and that <HI>all rejoiced believing in God,</HI> as it does that <HI>all</HI> were <HI>baptized,</HI> Act. 16.31&mdash;34. None &s;peaks more plainy again&s;t <HI>national churches</HI> than this author pretends to do; yet how vain are all &s;uch pretences, while he holds things thus? For all know that families are the foundation of nations: the old <HI>national church</HI> all &s;prang from one eminent believer.</P>
<P>Upon the other ca&s;e viz. the <HI>thief on the cro&s;s,</HI> he takes &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from Me&s;&s;irs. <HI>Flavel, Bo&s;ton,</HI> and <HI>Willi&s;on;</HI> wherein they warn &s;ouls again&s;t <HI>neg|lecting</HI> the <HI>great &s;alvation</HI> becau&s;e of that in&s;tance of one who found mercy at the la&s;t: and becau&s;e they &s;ay, that was an <HI>extraordinary</HI> time, &s;uch as will not happen again, and that the thief never had an offer of grace before. This author, catching at &s;uch expre&s;&s;i|ons, <HI>metamorpho&s;eth</HI> their di&s;cour&s;e, till he would make their meaning to be <Q>That the pardoned &s;in|ner had extraordinary merit, namely, of the nega|tive kind, yea, that he had within him a very live|ly &s;park of goodne&s;s;</Q> and &s;trains it even to this, that, <Q>extraordinary mercy was, upon an extraor|dinary occa&s;ion, &s;hewn to extraordinary worth.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. 2 p 46, 47.</NOTE></Q> And having changed their meaning in &s;uch a wretch|ed manner, he then compares them to <HI>Proteus,</HI> who,

<P>Yet Jehovah calls the <HI>heavens</HI> and <HI>earth</HI> to <HI>give ear</HI> to what he <HI>hath &s;poken,</HI> becau&s;e his people <HI>doth</HI> not CONSIDER I&s;ai. 1.2, 3. The rea&s;on this man gives why the&s;e divines cannot mean right, is that it can never do to &s;ay, a per&s;on delays believing a te&s;timo|ny now, in hopes of finding it to be true hereafter: and &s;o ridicules the notion of men's delaying their faith. But God's word informs us that when <HI>Felix</HI> heard <HI>Paul concerning the faith in Chri&s;t;</HI> &s;o that truth made him <HI>tremble,</HI> and his immediate an&s;wer was, <HI>go thy way for this time.</HI> And as we are expre&s;ly told that <HI>faith comes by hearing;</HI> &s;o the danger of <HI>neglecting</HI> it, is often warned again&s;t in the&s;e terms, <HI>To day if ye will hear his voice hardned not your hearts.</HI> And though he treats them with contempt for holding forth that the thief had not out&s;tood &s;uch calls as pre&s;umptuous &s;inners now do! yet <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, <HI>I obtained mercy becau&s;e</HI> I &s;inned IGNORANTLY, <HI>in unbelief.</HI> 1 Tim. 1.13.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time this writer would be &s;o far, from being accounted an enemy to good works, that he gives it as <HI>Paul</HI>'s mind, intimated to true Chri&s;tians, <Q>that they could not warrantably be a&s;&s;ured of their hap|py &s;tate by any exerci&s;e or mind, without the &s;elf denied <HI>works</HI> of obedience.</Q> And he takes pains to di&s;tingui&s;h between the a&s;&s;urance of faith, and the a&s;&s;urance of hope, and refers the fir&s;t to the <HI>truth</HI> be|lieved, the other to our <HI>intere&s;t</HI> therein.

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JAMES II. 22.</HI></BIBL>
<P>See&s;t thou how Faith wrought with his Works, and by works was Faith made perfect.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_SOME have thought that there was a diffe|rence in &s;entiment between <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>James,</HI> becau&s;e one in&s;i&s;ts &s;o much upon ju&s;|tification by faith without works; and the other a&s;&s;erts that by works a man is ju&s;tified, and not by faith only. But if the &s;cope and occa&s;ion of their writings be duly attended to, this &s;eeming con|tradiction will vani&s;h. <HI>Paul</HI> laboured chiefly upon laying the foundation of chri&s;tianity, where Chri&s;t had not been named; and &s;carce any thing is more natural than for &s;ouls when awakned to think, that as by breaking the law they expo&s;ed them&s;elves to divine wrath; &s;o that the way to appea&s;e that wrath, and obtain God's favour is to keep the law: therefore he engageth with all his might again&s;t all &s;uch notions, and fully proves that nothing but Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s can ju&s;tify us before God: while <HI>James</HI> wrote principally to profe&s;&s;ors, to &s;tir them up, and exhort them to live agreable to their pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="30" REF="010549_0028_0F806BD0F7FB67D8">
in the &s;everal places where they were <HI>&s;catter|ed abroad;</HI> and to expo&s;e the ab&s;urdity of pretending to have faith when it did not produce obedience. He puts the que&s;tion, <HI>What doth it profit my brethren, tho' a man &s;ay he hath faith, and have not works? can faith &s;ave him?</HI> That is, can that be &s;aving faith which does not bring forth good fruit; and what profit is there in a man's &s;aying he has it, when we have only his bare word to prove it? And he pro|ceeds to make this demand, &mdash;<HI>Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will &s;hew thee my faith by my works:</HI> From whence it appears that the ju&s;tification which he is there upon, is what is <HI>evidential,</HI> a <HI>&s;hew|ing</HI> and evidencing to others that we have ju&s;tifying faith And to illu&s;trate the matter he brings in the example of the father of the faithful, &s;aying, <Q>was not <HI>Abrabam</HI> our father ju&s;tified by works, when he had offered <HI>I&s;aac</HI> his &s;on upon the altar? <HI>Abraham</HI> belie|ved God and it was accounted to him for righteou&s;|ne&s;s,</Q> long before that time; but now the evidence thereof, and of his true regard to God's authority, &s;hined forth with peculiar lu&s;ture, which I take to be the import of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>Now I know that thou feare&s;t God. Gen.</HI> 22.12. With great propriety therefore, is this example introduced to detect a <HI>dead faith,</HI> and to &s;hew the difference between that and a <HI>living one.</HI></P>
<P>The apo&s;tle would have us ob&s;erve it well: <HI>See&s;t thou how faith wrought with his works?</HI> how power|fully it governed his heart and conduct, in &s;uch a try|ing affair. Yet let us remember, he does not &s;ay, "&s;ee how his works produced his faith": No, he &s;ets faith as the leading grace, and tells us in the next ver&s;e, that <HI>the &s;cripture was fulfilled which &s;aith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s. James</HI> held to ju&s;tifi|cation
<PB N="31" REF="010549_0029_0F806BD1B4ECF340">
by <HI>imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as much as <HI>Paul:</HI> and on the other hand, <HI>Paul</HI> held to faith which wor|keth by love, and makes &s;ouls careful to maintain good works <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gal.</HI> 5.6. <HI>Tit</HI> 3.8.</NOTE> as much as <HI>James;</HI> they were &s;weetly agreed.</P>
<P>What I &s;hall further attempt from this text, as divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance may be granted, is,

<ITEM>I. To open the nature of Faith.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Shew its powerful influence on the heart and life.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. How by works it is made perfect.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. I &s;hall endeavour to open the nature of this faith upon which there have been great controver|&s;ies in our day. And I &s;hall endeavour to keep clo&s;e to the &s;cripture account of it, which &s;hews plainly,</P>
<P N="1">1. That Chri&s;t is the <HI>author</HI> as well as <HI>fini&s;her</HI> of our faith: and that it is wrought in the &s;oul by the <HI>exceeding greatne&s;s</HI> of God's power. <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.2.<HI>Eph.</HI> 1.19.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the <HI>word</HI> is the means of it; <HI>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Rom.</HI> 10. 17</P>
<P N="3">3. That the heart of man is the &s;ubject of this grace: <HI>With the heart man believeth, Rom.</HI> 10.10. yea with <HI>all the heart, Acts</HI> 8.37. Thus the author, means and &s;eat of this principle, are plainly pointed out: but &s;till it is inquired what is the nature of faith? To this the an&s;wer is ready,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It is the &s;ub&s;tance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not &s;een.</HI> Heb. 11.1. <HI>The things hoped for,</HI> are all the ble&s;&s;ings which are promi&s;ed in the go&s;|pel; grace and glory, and every good thing that God's people need. Faith takes his word for all, and by it they appear <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial realities</HI> to the &s;oul. <HI>The things not &s;een,</HI> comprehend all the affairs of the invi&s;ible and eternal world, which are revealed in the word; &s;uch as the being and perfection of God; his creating all things out of nothing, and upholding all
<PB N="32" REF="010549_0030_0F806BD4A52798C0">
things by the word of his power; his creating man in his own image, and giving to him a law as the rule, and condition of his life; man's breaking that law, whereby death and mi&s;ery are brought upon the world! the doctrine of the trinity; the &s;on of God's undertaking for us, and his taking upon him our nature, wherein he obeyed and &s;uffered in our &s;tead, the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, that he might bring us to God; the holy Gho&s;t's coming to apply the&s;e great ble&s;|&s;ings; the re&s;urrection, general judgment, and the future &s;tate of happine&s;s to the righteous, and mi&s;ery to the wicked. The&s;e and all other matters of di|vine revelation, faith is the <HI>evidence</HI> of.</P>
<P>Evidence is to di&s;cover what is otherwi&s;e unknown, and to decide controver&s;ies. Now the <HI>world by wi&s;|dom knew not God;</HI> and they are full of controver&s;ies about divine things. But faith takes the divine evi|dence as that which is &s;ufficient to end all di&s;putes. The believer &s;ettles the matter there, if God has &s;aid it, that is enough; <HI>for if we receive the witne&s;s of men, the witne&s;s of God is greater.</HI> Human te&s;timo|ny about di&s;tant things, tho' it &s;hould come from per&s;ons of good credit, yet the things are di&s;tant and invi&s;ible to us, and we know men may be mi&s;taken: but the Lord pre&s;ents the great things which concern our peace in <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> view, to the believing &s;oul. His word is compared to <HI>gla&s;s,</HI> which opens as it were a window into the eternal world, &s;o that when the &s;pirit takes the <HI>veil from our hearts, we all with open face, beholding as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are chan|ged into the &s;ame image,</HI> 2 Cor. 3. 16&mdash;18.</P>
<P>The&s;e plain &s;criptures may teach us the evil of that opinion 'that in the fir&s;t act of faith we believe, that which was not true before'. The objects were the &s;ame before, tho' we did not &s;ee them 'till then. And
<PB N="33" REF="010549_0031_0F806BD538CD0BD0">
there is as little truth in a&s;&s;erting on the other hand, <Q>that we have no knowledge of our intere&s;t in tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, <HI>in</HI> faith, but only by its <HI>effects</HI> afterwards.</Q> Indeed the glory of divine objects engages our fir&s;t attention; yet as the fir&s;t <HI>entrance of the word gi|veth light,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.130.</NOTE> it gives the &s;oul at the &s;ame in&s;tant, &s;ome knowledge and enjoyment of the benefits of the glorious <HI>Sun!</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 84.11. <HI>Mal.</HI> 4.2.</NOTE> and which is greatly con&s;umed by after effects. <Q>The conveyance of the truth to them for their relief, as much prevents every motion of their will, as did the divine gracious purpo&s;e before the world was.</Q> For the guilt of unbelief lies in this, that <HI>light is come into the world, and men love dark|ne&s;s rather than light:</HI> And <HI>their eyes have they clo|&s;ed, lea&s;t they &s;hould &s;ee and be converted, and healed.</HI> They are <HI>willingly ignorant</HI> of the evidence of the truth of God's word, which &s;hines in all his works. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Joh.</HI> 3.19. <HI>Acts</HI> 28.27. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.5.</NOTE> Now how can any &s;oul po&s;&s;ibly be turned herefrom, to <HI>behold the lamb of God which taketh away the Sin of the world,</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> 1.29.</NOTE> without any motion of his will? Another mi&s;take may likewi&s;e be detected here. Some hold that the faith which unbelievers are condemn'd for the neglect of, is a lower kind of faith, than that which is &s;aving. But what is &s;aving faith be&s;ide this, viz a <HI>receiving</HI> with <HI>all the heart</HI> the <HI>witne&s;s</HI> and <HI>te&s;timony</HI> that <HI>God hath given us, of eternal life in his Son?</HI> 1 Joh. 5.9&mdash;12. And he that <HI>believeth not God, hath made him a liar.</HI> The evidence of this truth &s;hines &s;o clearly as to leave all without ex|cu&s;e, who do not believe with <HI>all their hearts;</HI> while every &s;oul that is made willing by divine power, to <HI>receive his te&s;timony, and &s;et to his &s;eal that God is true,</HI> knows that this <HI>faith is not of him&s;elf;</HI> it is the

<P N="2">II. To con&s;ider the powerful influence of faith on the heart and life. <HI>See&s;t thou how &s;aith wrought with his works?</HI> how it moved him to ready obedience. When the command came, <Q>Take now thy &s;on, thine only &s;on <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> whom thou love&s;t, and get thee into the land of <HI>Moriah;</HI> and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I &s;hall tell thee of!</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> 22.</NOTE> <HI>Abraham</HI> knew it to be God's call, and that was enough for him; he never &s;tands to confer with fle&s;h and blood, nor to &s;ay, <Q>I am in a ju&s;tified &s;tate, and therefore I &s;hall be &s;a|ved if I do not comply with &s;o &s;urprizing and trying ;a command.</Q> No, tho' there never was a com|mand which nature might form more plau&s;ible pleas again&s;t than this; yet he makes no delay, but ri&s;eth early in the morning, prepares for the journey and goes three days travel to the appointed place, for the heart rending work; and there, with un&s;haken re&s;o|lution he proceeds in his obedience, until a voice from heaven gave him a relea&s;e from &s;acrificing his &s;on, and &s;aid, <HI>Now I know that thou feare&s;t God, &s;eeing thou ha&s;t not witheld thy &s;on, thine only &s;on from me,</HI> Gen. 22. 1&mdash;12.</P>
<P>Come precious &s;ouls, attend here and learn what that <HI>fear of God is,</HI> which is &s;o often enjoined and re|commended in &s;cripture: it is not that <HI>dread</HI> that moves many to work like <HI>&s;laves</HI> for fear of puni&s;h|ment; but it is a <HI>noble regard</HI> to God which flows from acquaintance with him, and faith in him, where|by by the &s;aint views him as worthy to be obeyed with all our powers, and that nothing is too dear to be given up at his command. Such is the nature and influence
<PB N="35" REF="010549_0033_0F806BD640C280F8">
of true faith. There are three things in faith which powerfully excite to obedience, and guard again&s;t all the &s;nares of &s;in: The believing &s;oul views the <HI>pre|cept</HI> to be true and excellent, therefore to be obeyed; the <HI>promi&s;e</HI> to be &s;ure and &s;ufficient, therefore he &s;hall be <HI>&s;upported;</HI> and faith pre&s;ents eternal thing as <HI>near</HI> and <HI>real,</HI> therefore to be <HI>regarded</HI> without delay. And if we carefully ob&s;erve, we &s;hall find that in the&s;e are the main &s;prings of obedience, and that the contrary, is the root of all mi&s;chief.</P>

<P N="1"><PB N="42" REF="010549_0040_0F806BDDBA1143D0">1. That hereby the perfect, or excellent nature of faith is <HI>made manife&s;t:</HI> So the word <HI>made</HI> is &s;ometimes u&s;ed; as by <HI>Peter</HI> on the day of pentico&s;t: <HI>Let all the hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>know a&s;&s;uredly, that God hath</HI> made <HI>that &s;ame Je&s;us, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Chri&s;t,</HI> Acts 2.36.

<P N="1">1.

<P>Yet (amazing to think of!) the &s;cripture is not fuller of proofs for the&s;e doctrines, than the world is of oppo&s;ition again&s;t them; but if we examine care|fully, we &s;hall find, that what is &s;aid again&s;t the doct|rines of grace, proceeds chiefly from the &s;ame quarter,

that the fal&s;e prophets <HI>dreams</HI> did of old, namely, the <HI>deceit of their own hearts.</HI> We may often hear men, telling how they would gratify their lu&s;ts, if they believed them doctrines were true; and al&s;o that if their good works, did nothing towards intitling them to divine favour, they would never do any more. Such language, has often reminded me of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s remarks, that <HI>when he that is a fool wal|keth by the way, his wi&s;dom faileth him, and he &s;aith to every one that he is a fool;</HI> for what greater folly can a man expre&s;s, than this? Such language holds forth plainly, that all their delight is in &s;in, and there|fore if they were once delivered from fear of the con|&s;equence, they would indulge their lu&s;ts without con|troul, with all their might: and that as to their pre|tended good works, <HI>&s;elf</HI> is the &s;pring and end of them all; &s;o that if <HI>&s;elf</HI> was but &s;ecure they would not care what became of God's honor, or others welfare; and on the other hand, if <HI>&s;elf</HI> might not lay in &s;ome claim for the &s;ervices they do for God, they would quit the tedious bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<P>However, &s;ince you are for appealing to <HI>facts,</HI> we will try a few of them. None that believe the &s;crip|tures can rea&s;onably deny that the <HI>Jews</HI> had high no|tions of their power to do good works: <HI>Paul</HI> &s;pea|keth expre&s;&s;y, that they <HI>followed after the law of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and had a <HI>zeal for God;</HI> and he is as expre&s;s concerning the rea&s;on why they did not attain to it, <HI>becau&s;e they &s;ought it not by faith,</HI> Rom. 9.31, 32.102 They had no &s;uch faith as he taught in &s;overeign de|crees, and &s;overeign mercy to helple&s;s &s;inners. No, they held to works which they could do, to entitle them to divine ble&s;&s;ings. Now let us &s;ee what fruits the&s;e principles produced; they <HI>both killed the Lord Je&s;us, and their own prophets, and per&s;ecuted the apo&s;|tles: they plea&s;ed not God and were contrary to all men,</HI> &amp;c. 1 The&s;. 2.15.16. But the apo&s;tles on the other hand, preached that both <HI>Jew</HI> and Gentile were all under &s;in, and that by grace we are &s;aved thro' faith, and that not of our&s;elves, it is the gift of God. And the&s;e doctrines &s;pread their victorious and happy influ|ence as far as the <HI>Roman</HI> conque&s;ts had ever extended.</P>
<P>Afterwards there came on a terrible <HI>falling away,</HI> and the <HI>man of &s;in</HI> was revealed, who oppo&s;ed the&s;e doctrines, and carried his notions of man's power to do good works &s;o far as to hold, that he could do more than were required.

This &s;hocked <HI>Luther;</HI> and he and <HI>Calvin,</HI> and others were moved to <HI>prote&s;t</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e abominations, and boldly to preach tho&s;e doctrines, which have born <HI>Calvins</HI> name ever &s;ince.

good effects then, but &s;uch as are either &s;ecret or open friends to <HI>popery.</HI> Great was the &s;pread, and happy the influence of the&s;e doctrines in our nation at tho&s;e times; yet the contrary principles have &s;ince ex|ten&s;ively prevailed.

In &s;hort we have preached morality &s;o long, that we have hardly any morality left; and this <HI>moral preaching</HI> has made our people &s;o very immoral, that there are no lengths of wicked|ne&s;s which they are afraid of running into.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Jone's</HI> Sermon at the vi&s;itation of the Archdeacon of <HI>Surry,</HI> Sept. 1755 page 16, 17.</NOTE></Q></P>

<P>Yet where the divine honor, and the life of &s;ouls is at &s;take, the contrary method is taken.

<PB N="79" REF="010549_0077_0F806C05833CEB20">
they are mo&s;t open and notorious facts; and if any would give me a better rea&s;on for this difference in conduct, than this, I &s;hould be glad to hear it; viz. That mo&s;t men are wi&s;er for time, than for eter|nity, and have more concern about their own inte|re&s;t, than the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t's kingdom in the world. And in vain do men wi&s;h for better times, while divine rule is thus di&s;regarded; they might as well look for peace while enemies are not guarded a|gain&s;t; or for health while contagion is freely &s;pread.</P>
<P>Therefore, V. The&s;e things &s;hould rou&s;e us all, and engage our &s;ouls to regard without delay the on|ly method of relief in our deplorable circum&s;tances, before iniquity prove the ruin of our nation and land.</P>
<P>But here I am come to the mo&s;t difficult point in the whole chri&s;tian plan, I mean applying the call and command to impotent creatures. None but God can keep us from &s;traying to the right or left hand here. Multitudes hold it to be unrea&s;onable for God to require that which the creature cannot do; tho' the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch a notion appears!</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e the divine command ever remains <HI>holy ju&s;t and good,</HI> altho' we are <HI>carnal &s;old under &s;in,</HI> Rom. 7.12, 14. What a &s;trange conceit would it be, to conclude the creditors claims to be unju&s;t, becau&s;e of the bankruptcy of the <HI>debtor!</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. All &s;in is a voluntary contrariety to the divine will; how rea&s;onable then is it that we &s;hould be cal|led and commanded to that which mu&s;t be our hear|ty choice, or we never can be &s;aved? and that is a <HI>turning from &s;in to God,</HI> Ezek. 33.10.11.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nothing but the light and power of the com|mand, brought home upon the con&s;cience, can ever make a &s;oul truely to know its mi&s;ery, and &s;o to prize the remedy which is provided: for without a &s;oul

knows he is &s;ick, he will not improve a phy&s;ician; 'till he knows he is a pri&s;oner he will not welcome a proclamation of liberty; and 'till he is convinced of his great and ju&s;t debts, and that he has <HI>nothing to pay,</HI> he will not <HI>love much</HI> when they are all <HI>frankly forgiven,</HI> Luk. 4.18. &amp; 5.31. &amp; 7.42.</P>
<P N="4">4 God's call conveys light and life to the &s;oul, when and where he plea&s;eth. When <HI>Ezekiel</HI> viewed the bones that were very dry, he prophe&s;ied, as he was commanded, and &s;aid, <HI>O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord:</HI> and how glorious was the effect? The divine call is, <HI>Awake thou that &s;leepest, and ari&s;e from the dead, and Chri&s;t &s;hall give thee light,</HI> Eph. 5.14. So our apo&s;tle after mentioning, that every good gift cometh from the father of lights, who of <HI>his own will begets</HI> &s;ouls with the <HI>word of truth,</HI> &s;ays <HI>wherefore, let every man be &s;wift to bear,</HI> Jam. 1.17 &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here therefore let us ob&s;erve that true teaching e|ver &s;hews our con&s;tant obligation to conform to eve|ry divine rule; and at the &s;ame time, that all our help &s;o to do, mu&s;t be freely received from Chri&s;t Je&s;us, by the influence of the holy &s;pirit. From thence we re|ceive the <HI>gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> whereby all our crimes are forgiven; and <HI>abundance of grace,</HI> whereby our natures are charged, and our &s;ouls are enabled to die unto &s;in, and live unto righteou&s;ne&s;s. But fal&s;e tea|ching will either <HI>abate</HI> part of the price, in order to accomodate our duty to our ability, or el&s;e excu&s;e the creature from his <HI>obligation,</HI> becau&s;e he is not able to fulfil it.</P>
<P>This difference appears plain in all ages. When <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> in a moving manner had pre&s;&s;ed home upon <HI>I&s;rael</HI> the importance of chu&s;ing that day whom they would &s;erve, and which had &s;uch effect, that the peo|ple an&s;wered, <HI>we will &s;erve the Lord:</HI>&mdash;he imme|diately

adds, <HI>ye cannot &s;erve the Lord; for he is an holy God</HI> Jo&s;hua 4 15&mdash;19. He would have them know their impotency, and their need of divine help.</P>
<P>The prophets orders were, <HI>Tell ye; there is no God el&s;e be&s;ide me, a ju&s;t God and a Savior. Look unto me and be ye &s;aved, all ye ends of the earth &mdash; Surely &s;hall one &s;ay, in the Lord have I righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength.</HI> Strength as well as righteou&s;ne&s;s is <HI>in</HI> him, and not in our&s;elves. So our Redeemer when he came, in&s;i&s;ted much on the &s;trictne&s;s and authority, of the divine command, and our con&s;tant obligation to obedience; and at the &s;ametime, he as fully a&s;&s;erted, that <HI>without</HI> him we <HI>can do nothing,</HI> Mat. 5 Joh. 15. While the leaders of mo&s;t note in that day, <HI>abated</HI> the terms in various &s;hapes. They would confine the law, only to outward actions; but Je&s;us extends it to our inward di&s;po&s;ition, and de&s;igns: they would have an ob&s;ervance of &s;mall things an&s;wer, while they neg|lected the <HI>weightier matters of the law:</HI> yea, they would fain have their <HI>forms of devotion</HI> &s;uffice, while they exerci&s;ed <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>cruelty</HI> towards the <HI>poor.</HI> Yet they could not bear the thoughts of peri&s;hing any more than others: no, they often enquired what <HI>good things they &s;hould do</HI> for eternal life? And can the words <HI>go&s;pel, faith</HI> or <HI>repentance</HI> help the&s;e in the lea&s;t who deal with &s;ouls in this <HI>partial</HI> line; and can their ca&s;e be a whit better than tho&s;e who of old had been <HI>partial in the law?</HI> Mal. 2.9. Yea, and is not <HI>ju&s;tice, mercy</HI> and <HI>faithfulne&s;s</HI> as much neglected now under a profe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tianity, as ever they were among the <HI>Jews? Paul</HI> &s;aw the&s;e things creeping in, and therefore &s;ays, <HI>Be not deceived: evil communica|tions corrupt good manners.

That is thou can&s;t not believe, becau&s;e thou art ju&s;t &s;uch a creature as Je&s;us came to &s;ave! 1 Tim. 1.15.

We can &s;carce go into any company without hearing talk of others faults; yet how rare is faithful reproof? and why? we are afraid of giving offence: tho' when the report comes round to the per&s;ons ears, the of|fence is double.</P>
<P>How little regard is paid to the divine rule, for dealing with a faulty brother in <HI>Mat.</HI> 18? <HI>One</HI> way by which many evade it is, that the <HI>fault is &s;ecret,</HI> and therefore they will not take the&s;e &s;teps; yet they can whi&s;per it all round the church or neighbour|hood. <HI>Another</HI> is that <HI>many know it,</HI> and &s;o they would be excu&s;ed from that method; whereas if the ca&s;e be not openly <HI>in the church,</HI> as that was of the ince&s;tous man at <HI>Corinth,</HI> I know no other way to <HI>bring it in</HI> aright, but by the&s;e &s;teps. and if any ca&s;e be &s;o <HI>&s;ecret</HI> that we may not open it in <HI>that way,</HI> it ought to remain <HI>&s;ecret:</HI> for the command is, <HI>Debate thy cau&s;e with thy neighbour him&s;elf; and di&s;cover not a &s;ecret to another; lea&s;t he that heareth it, put thee to &s;hame,</HI> Prov. 25.9, 10.</P>
