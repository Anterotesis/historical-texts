<HEAD>A Memorable in&s;tance of the Divine Protection and deliverance, of JAMES DICKENSON and JANE FEARON, on their religious vi&s;it to Scotland, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in the borders of that nation they were travelling with a per&s;on who they had cho&s;en for a guide to a certain town they propo&s;ed to reach that night; which being a very long &s;tage, and it raining very heavy, Jane Fearon growing very fatigued wi&s;hed to put up before they reached the town if a &s;uitable place could be obtained, which their guide a&s;&s;ured them could not, but being ex|ceedingly wet and weary, and coming up to a good looking hou&s;e enquired of them whether they could obtain a lodging and entertainment till the abatement of the &s;torm, and being an|&s;wered in the affirmative, they determined to tarry there, notwith&s;tanding the per&s;ua&s;ions of their director to pur&s;ue their journey (he be|ing acquainted with the de&s;igns of the people of the hou&s;e) he finding it was their determin|ation to &s;top, bid them farewel, telling them they would have no further need of him, but did not like to explain him&s;elf in hearing of the people of the hou&s;e, and left them with regret, <GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="4" REF="026886_0003_0FD245D594FFA7F8">&mdash;On their alighting they were conducted in|to a large room with a fire in it, which o|pened into the kitchen or common room, where the family kept; their hor&s;es were ta|ken care of and their wet things put to dry, &amp; apparently they were likely to be very well accommodated; a po&s;&s;et was made for them, and a cold meat pye brought for their &s;upper; but at their &s;etting down at the table they grear very unea&s;y, however one not knowing how the other felt (each determined to keep to them&s;elves their feelings) till at length Jane &s;aid, that her apprehen&s;ions were &s;o great, and her opinion of the family &s;o bad, that &s;he fully believed that the pye which was on the table was made of human fle&s;h, which, however, Dicken&s;on &s;carcely believed was the ca&s;e, &s;aying he thought it nouri&s;hing at that time.</P>
<P>As they were talking Jane ob&s;erved three ill-looking men come in, and with a low voice told the landlady that they had good hor&s;es; aye, an&s;wered &s;he, and good &s;addle bags too. Jane's unea&s;ine&s;s encrea&s;ing, Dicken&s;on's mind became clo&s;ely engaged to &s;eek for the cau&s;e, and for divine coun&s;el how to proceed, and under this exerci&s;e was favored to believe that if they kept clo&s;e to that, and &s;trictly at|tended
<PB N="5" REF="026886_0004_0FD245D85DBDB560">to its pointings they &s;hould be pre&s;erv|ed and, way made for their e&s;cape, on which he enquired about their lodgings, telling them they had &s;ome writing to do and wanted can|dles for that purpo&s;e and propo&s;ed to retire to their appartment, when they were &s;hewn in|to a chamber on the &s;ide of a yard with two beds in it, but without any bolts to the doors, and ob&s;erving a form or bench in the room, tried therewith to fa&s;ten one of the doors and found it would an&s;wer the purpo&s;e by fix|ing the end of it again&s;t one of the beds; af|ter which Jane &s;at down and manife&s;ted their di&s;tre&s;s by wringing her hands and &s;aying &s;he believed they &s;hould never get out of that hou&s;e alive, on which Dicken&s;on &s;at down by her, and advi&s;ed her to be &s;till, telling her that he had been under equal di&s;tre&s;s of mind from their fir&s;t &s;etting down in the hou&s;e, and that under that exerci&s;e, &s;eeking for the be&s;t help, his mind had been favored by that which never deceived him, to believe that if they care|fully minded its pointings, they &s;hould be direct|ed how to e&s;cape, on which they &s;at down in perfect &s;ilence for &s;ome con&s;iderable time, attentively waiting for be&s;t direction, when at length Dicken&s;on &s;aid the time for them to flee was then, and having ob&s;erved the door
<PB N="6" REF="026886_0005_0FD245DBA644D830">oppo&s;ite to the one they had already &s;ecured let out of the hou&s;e by a pair of &s;tone &s;tairs into the road, believing that was the way for them to get off, he bid Jane put off her &s;hoes as he did al&s;o, and &s;oftly opening the door perceiv|ed by a light through a chink in the &s;tairs to their terror, a woman &s;harpening a large knife and making other preparations for their mur|der, as they &s;uppo&s;ed, and going &s;oftly down the &s;teps, kept on the road till out of hearing of the hou&s;e, they then quickened their pace, and he taking Jane by the arm, they ran about half a mile, when they di&s;covered a &s;ort of ho|vel or cott, and it &s;till raining exce&s;&s;ive hard, they tried to take refuge there, whereby to re|fre&s;h them&s;elves a little and &s;helter them&s;elves from the turbulence of the weather, there be|ing &s;ome &s;traw left there for the cattle, but found by the painful &s;en&s;ation renewed on their minds that they were not &s;a&s;e there, (not|with&s;tanding their exce&s;&s;ive wearine&s;s, and Jane being ready to faint with di&s;courage|ment) Dicken&s;on urged the nece&s;&s;ity of their exerting them&s;elves, under the firm hope that they &s;hould be pre&s;erved, and they went for|ward as fa&s;t as they could till they came to the &s;ide of a water, the cour&s;es of which fol|lowed to a bridge, over which they attempted
<PB N="7" REF="026886_0006_0FD22B0E577518B0">to pa&s;s, but felt re&s;trained when they got upon it, and James &s;aid that was not their way, &s;o turned about and followed the edge of the river about half a mile further, the water encrea&s;ing in breadth; they there &s;topped, and Dicken&s;on &s;aid they mu&s;t cro&s;s at that place, which exceedingly alarmed Jane, having giv|en way to &s;o much di&s;couragement that &s;he &s;carcely could hope that they &s;hould not to|tally &s;ink under their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and told Dicken&s;on that &s;he apprehended if they went into that water they &s;hould be drowned, but he endeavored to cheer her, reminding her of the evidence he had of their pre&s;ervation if they kept a &s;teady eye to be&s;t direction, which he believed had led them thus far, and that through the water was the only way for their retreat, and that he believed they &s;hould get &s;afe to the other &s;ide, whereupon with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of his arm &s;he ventured and they got &s;afe to the other &s;ide, and walking &s;ome di&s;t|ance they came to a &s;and bank, here &s;etting down they congratulated each other that they had &s;o far e&s;caped from the&s;e inhuman peo|ple; but James was not yet ea&s;y in his mind, he &s;aid they were not &s;afe yet, and mu&s;t go farther, to which Jane replied, "I mu&s;t go by thy faith, for I know not what to do."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="026886_0007_0FD245E84C1E8DE8">
They going a little farther, found another &s;and bank wherein was a cavity where they &s;et down. After they had been here a while, Dicken&s;on &s;aid I am now quite ea&s;y and be|lieve we are perfectly &s;afe, and feel in my heart a &s;ong of Thank&s;giving and Prai&s;e;&mdash; Jane replied I am &s;o far from that, I can|not &s;o much as &s;ay <HI>Lord have mercy on us.</HI></P>
<P>When they had been here about half an hour they heard &s;ome people on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, upon which James finding Jane was alarmed and fearing they &s;hould be di&s;covered, &s;oftly told her their lives depended upon their &s;ilence. Then attentively harken|ing to what the people &s;aid, heard them di&s;|tinctly &s;peak to their dog, and &s;ay, <HI>Seek 'em Keeper!</HI> and &s;uppo&s;ed them to be the men they had &s;een at the hou&s;e, accompanied with a dog, that the dog refu&s;ing to go over the bridge, had followed the &s;cent of their feet along the river &s;ide to the place where they cro&s;&s;ed, when &s;topping, the people again re|peated <HI>&s;eek 'em Keeper!</HI> which they heard; and they &s;aw the people with a lanthorn, they al&s;o heard them &s;ay they had there cro&s;&s;ed the river, to which the other replied <HI>that's impo&s;|&s;ible, unle&s;s the Devil took them over,</HI> for the river was brim full.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="026886_0008_0FD245EC9CBC6A30">
After wearying them&s;elves a con&s;iderable time in their &s;earch, they went away, and they &s;aw them no more.</P>
<P>When day light appeared, they &s;aw a man on a high hill at a di&s;tance looking about him every way, they continued quiet in their re|treat till &s;ome time after &s;un ri&s;e, when upon taking a view of their &s;ituation, they di&s;cov|ered that under the fir&s;t &s;and bank from whence they removed, they might have been &s;een from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore&mdash;which they had been in&s;en&s;ible of, as they could not make the ob&s;ervation the night before, when they con|&s;idered what they &s;hould do to recover their hor&s;es, &s;addle bags, &amp;c. James &s;aid, I incline to return to the hou&s;e but Jane propo|&s;ed their going to a town in order to get a&s;&s;i&s;|tance to go with them, to which James ob&s;er|ved, that the town was ten miles off, and that they were &s;trangers, and had nothing to do with&mdash;Jane &s;till he&s;itating, James &s;aid, I &s;till incline to return to the hou&s;e, fully believing our hor&s;es, clothes &amp;c. will be ready for us, without a&s;king a que&s;tion; and that the peo|ple we &s;aw la&s;t night, we &s;hall &s;ee no more.&mdash; The other &s;aid, friend I think I dare not go back again, James &s;aid, thou maye&s;t &s;afely, for I have &s;een it in that, that never faileth me,
<PB N="10" REF="026886_0009_0FD245EE4B184560">upon which they returned to the hou&s;e, and found their hor&s;es &s;tanding in the &s;table, &s;ad|dled, and their bags upon them, their clothes dryed and ready to put on, and &s;aw no per&s;on but one old woman, in a corner on a rock by the fire-&s;ide, whom they did not remember of &s;eeing the night before; they a&s;ked her what they had to pay, di&s;charging and pro|ceeding on their journey. Sometime after, Dicken&s;on travelling the &s;ame way, in truths &s;ervice, pa&s;&s;ed the place where the above hou&s;e &s;tood, but found it was pulled down and totally de&s;troyed; which coming to the inn at the town, they had thought to have gone too when they put up on account of the heavy rain, as before mentioned, he enquired what was become of the people, and the cau&s;e of the hou&s;e being &s;o in ruin. When he was told, that &s;ometime after he and Jane was there, &s;ome travellers who had been ob&s;erved to go there were mi&s;&s;ing, and having been long under a very bad name, the people &s;trongly &s;u&s;pecting they were murdered, ro&s;e with one general con&s;ent, and be&s;et the hou&s;e, taking up the people, and on &s;earching the hou&s;e, and its environs, found the bodies of the above, and tho&s;e of many others, in different &s;tates of decay, which had evidently been murdered;
<PB N="11" REF="026886_0010_0FD245F090638A98">and I think &s;ome part of the bodies wanting, with a great quantity of clothes &s;uppo&s;ed to have belonged to them, on which the people were tried, and I believe five of them were ex|ecuted, and the hou&s;e totally demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Our friend <HI>Samuel Smith,</HI> brought the a|bove account in manu&s;cript with him on his return from his religious vi&s;its, to the friends in Great Britain.</P>
<P>James Dicken&s;on was one of the mo&s;t emin|ent mini&s;ters in our religious &s;ociety, and vi&s;ited America three times. In the &s;hort journal publi&s;hed of his life and travels, in the year 1694 he mentions his vi&s;iting Scotland in company with another Friend, and notes their being delivered from the hands of un|merciful men, but does not give further par|ticulars, for the omi&s;&s;ion doubtle&s;s there was a cau&s;e.</P>
