<L>When Colin met me in the grove,</L>
<L>And told me tender tales of love.</L>
<L>Was ever &s;wain &s;o blithe as he?</L>
<L>So kind, &s;o faithful and &s;o free?</L>
<L>In &s;pite of all my friends cou'd &s;ay,</L>
<L>Young Colin &s;tole my heart away.</L>
<L>In &s;pite of all my friends cou'd &s;ay,</L>
<L>Young Colin &s;tole my heart away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whene'er he trips the meads along</L>
<L>He &s;weetly joins the woodlark's &s;ong;</L>
<L>And when he dances on the green</L>
<L>There's none &s;o blith as Colin &s;een.</L>
<L>If he's but by I nothing fear;</L>
<L>For I alone am all his care:</L>
<L>Then, &s;pite of all my friends can &s;ay,</L>
<L>He's &s;tole my tender heart away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My mother chides whene'er I roam,</L>
<L>And &s;eems &s;urpris'd I quit my home;</L>
<L>But &s;he'd not wonder that I love,</L>
<L>Did &s;he but feel how much I love.</L>
<L>Full well I know the generous &s;wain</L>
<L>Will never give my bo&s;om pain:</L>
<L>Then, &s;pite of all my friends can &s;ay,</L>
<L>He's &s;tole my tender heart away.</L>
