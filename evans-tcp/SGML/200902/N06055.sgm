A Commi&s;&s;ion from his Excellency JONATHAN BELCHER, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Captain General and Grvernor in Chief, in and over the Province of</HI> Nova-Cae&s;area <HI>or</HI> New-Jer&s;ey, <HI>and Territories thereon depending in</HI> Ame|rica, <HI>Chancellor and Vice Admiral in the &s;ame,</HI> &amp;c. was publi&s;hed, im|powering the Honourable <HI>Richard Saker, Lewis Morris A&s;hfield, Charles Read, Robert Lawrence, Samuel Smith, Barzilla Newhold,</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph Yard,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;qrs</ABBR> or any three or more of them, to treat with the <HI>Indians</HI> of the Colony of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> and to agree upon &s;uch Things, as they &s;hould e&s;teem conducive to the Peace and Welfare of the Colony.</P>
<P><HI>Jacob Howlings,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and <HI>Stephen Calvin,</HI> Interpretors attended, after which the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;poke to the <HI>Indians</HI> as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>WE are glad to &s;ee you here in Health, and hope tho&s;e you have left behind you in your Towns are in Health al&s;o.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of our meeting you at this Time, is, that we might have an opportunity of talking freely with each other as <HI>Brethren</HI> ought to do.</P>
<P>We are appointed by the Government, to give you the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urance of the Affection your <HI>Brethren</HI> of this Colony, have and will always retain for our <HI>Brethren</HI> the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>If therefore any Thing you know of, that may on either &s;ide de&s;troy the good Agreement that has continued for near <HI>one Hundred Years,</HI> between your Fathers and ours, you will now have an Oppor|tunity of mentioning it. And we hope you will do it in &s;uch a manner as that nothing may hereafter remain to give us or you any Occa&s;ion of Unea&s;ine&s;s, therefore we hope you will open your Minds freely.</P>
<P>We grieve for the Sufferings of our <HI>Brethren</HI> in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> who have &s;uffered much by <HI>Indians</HI> mi&s;led by bad and wicked Peo|ples Advice, but we hope an end will be &s;oon put to their Murder|ing your Friends and ours, and beleive the <HI>Indians</HI> will by the trou|ble they will bring them&s;elves into by hearkening to this wicked Advice, be made to repent of their bad Actions.</P>
<P>We hope none of our <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Brethren</HI> of this Colony are joined with the Wicked <HI>Indians</HI> who have been de&s;troying the Peo|ple of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P>And expect you will let us know all you have heard of the Intentions of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and if any of the Enemy <HI>Indians,</HI> or any &s;trange <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould come among you, to put evil and fal&s;e Things into your Heads,
<PB N="5" REF="007688_0005_102D9992B106A8C0">you will do well not to believe them, and that you will deliver them to us, as dangerous to our Peace and yours.</P>
<P>As we have heard &s;ome of the Enemy <HI>Indians</HI> have been in the upper Parts of this Province, and Murdered one Man, and wounded another, this and the Murders on the other &s;ide of the River, has made our People who live in the upper Parts of this Colony &s;o Angry, that it is become dangerous to any <HI>Indians</HI> to go there, as they will not in the hurry know Friends from Enemies. Therefore we would have you &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider with your&s;elves, that it will be nece&s;&s;a|ry for you to contrive &s;ome Bounds for your own Security, where you may be &s;afe, and our People ea&s;y with it. And as you are our <HI>Bre|thren,</HI> we would have your Advice in this Matter, and if you have any reque&s;t to make for your own ea&s;e and both our Security's, you will do well to let us know it, and we &s;hall give it due Con|&s;ideration.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="day's proceedings">
<HEAD><HI>Friday</HI> Morning, <HI>January</HI> the 9th 1756.</HEAD>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners met.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> came into Council, and having appointed <HI>Ohiockecho|que,</HI> to &s;peak for them; he delivered in their Names the following An&s;wer.</P>
<P>Dear <HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>SOME of our old Men can remember when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were weak and few, and the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;trong and many. We then nur&s;ed them up in our Bo&s;oms and treated them as Friends.</P>
<P>We are glad our Friend&s;hip hath continned &s;o long, and hope it will always endure.</P>
<P>Since our Fathers have &s;old &s;o large a Part of their Lands to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> we find it much more difficult to maintain our&s;elves and Fa|milies by Hunting, which is at lea&s;t one half our Support.</P>
<P>But a wor&s;e evil than that has come to us, which is the U&s;e of &s;trong Liquor, to which the <HI>Indians</HI> are too much addicted, and by which they are made Weak, Idle, and Quarrel&s;ome, and for &s;trong Drink often &s;ell tho&s;e Skins, and other Things, which would provide them&s;elves and Families with Cloaths and Bread, and for this &s;ome of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are too much to blame.</P>
<P>We beg you will take care to put a Stop to this wicked prac|ti&s;e,
<PB N="6" REF="007688_0006_102D9994A7B14140">which tho' it may offend &s;ome of our fooli&s;h People at fir&s;t, yet it will at la&s;t be be&s;t liked, and be more for the Health of Soul and Body.</P>
<P>The bringing in the ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel, we e&s;teem the greate&s;t ad|vantage we have received by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> coming among us, and we tru&s;t it hath been a means in the Hand of God to reform the Minds and Manners of a Number of us, and we prefer the Enjoyment of it and living with our <HI>Brethren</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> even to Life it&s;elf. It gives us a real concern, that any of our Acquaintance are joined with the <HI>French</HI> and their <HI>Indians.</HI> The Rea&s;on of their going to them, we beleive was, that they were &s;educed by Lies and Fal&s;ity's, becau&s;e the &s;ame Methods were u&s;ed with us, but without effect. As Times of great Di&s;tre&s;s are come on us, as well as you, we are willing to agree as <HI>Brethren,</HI> upon any Methods for our mutual Peace and Se|curity.</P>
<P>We propo&s;e the following, which we hope may be effectual.</P>
<P>We who live on this &s;ide <HI>Rariton</HI> River, will not on any occa|&s;ion, go to the Northward of <HI>Rariton</HI> River at <HI>Brunswick,</HI> and of the great Po&s;t Road that leads from <HI>Trenton</HI> to <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> except in tho&s;e Town &s;pots, but confine our&s;elves between the &s;aid Po&s;t Road and <HI>Delaware</HI> River, to the Sea Shores of this Province, while the War continues, in which Bounds we hope we &s;hall always have the free Liberty of Hunting, and beg that good care may be taken, that no Traps &s;hall be &s;ett there, which is of late very frequent and is very dangerous both to you and us.</P>
<P>If any of our Young Men go to War with you, we hope you will put them upon the &s;ame footing with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and that when our Married Men go to War, you will make &s;ome Provi&s;ion for their Families.</P>
<P>As &s;everal of us are obliged to leave our Habitations in this time of general Di&s;tre&s;s, we pray that &s;ome Releif may be provided for &s;uch. As it is the Misfortune of &s;ome of us to be in Debt, and we, for the publick Peace, are willing to deprive our&s;elves of &s;everal advantages we formerly enjoy'd, we pray that care may be taken that our Creditors may not be two pre&s;&s;ing, and we promi&s;e as &s;oon as we can, we will hone&s;tly pay our ju&s;t Debts. We pray that all abu&s;ive Words and Actions, which de&s;troy Love, may be puni&s;hed in both <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> We think we have &s;till &s;ome Peices of Land, for which we have received no Con&s;ideration, if it &s;hould prove &s;o, and we could get the Money for them, we hope we &s;hould be able, with &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance from our <HI>Brethren</HI> the <HI>En|glish,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="007688_0007_102D999942F93718">to purcha&s;e a Peice of Land &s;ufficient for us all to &s;ettle to|gether, and have the Go&s;pel among us, which is our great de&s;ire.</P>
<P>And we <HI>Pompton Indians,</HI> and others, living beyond <HI>Rariton,</HI> will confine our&s;elves within a Line to be drawn from that Part of the Sound between <HI>Staten I&s;land</HI> and the Main, which is neare&s;t to <HI>John Jolines,</HI> to go the neare&s;t Cour&s;e to the &s;aid <HI>John Jolines</HI> Hou&s;e, and &s;traight three Miles further into the Woods, and &s;o by a Line to be drawn thro' the Woods, at three Miles di&s;tance, back from the great Road that leads from <HI>John Jolines</HI> to <HI>Elizabeth-Town, Now|ark, Wezel,</HI> and <HI>John Jerolimans</HI> Mill, near the Falls of <HI>Pa&s;&s;aic,</HI> and from the &s;aid Falls near <HI>Jerolimans</HI> Mill to the Fork, and then to <HI>Pompton,</HI> and then on the neare&s;t &s;traight Line thro' <HI>Bergen</HI> County, to the <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> Line on the Shore of the North River, or <HI>Hud&s;ons</HI> Ri|ver, and &s;o by the Waters to were it began on the Sound.</P>
<P>We have to complain to our <HI>Brethren,</HI> that ill minded Per&s;ons are apt to take Advantage of the <HI>Indians</HI> when they are Drunk, and buy their Lands for a trifle, and often from the <HI>Indians</HI> who does not own it. And we pray our <HI>Brethren,</HI> that for the future no <HI>In|dian</HI> Deed or Lea&s;e may be allowed to be good, but what is made and Signed before the Governor, or two of his Council, who are to have a Certificate from &s;ix <HI>Indians,</HI> that the <HI>Indian</HI> who &s;ells the Land, is Owner of it, under the Hand of &s;ome Magi&s;trate, who &s;ees the fix <HI>Indians</HI> Sign it, and the Deed to have it wrote on the back, and &s;igned by the Governor, or two of his Council, that they &s;aw the Certificate of the &s;ix <HI>Indians,</HI> Signed by the Ju&s;tice, and that the <HI>Indian</HI> who &s;ells the Land, under&s;tood the Deed, and had a rea&s;on|able Price as common for it.</P>
<P>As &s;ome bad People have got a long Lea&s;e from a Drunken <HI>Indian</HI> for the <HI>Indian</HI> Lands at <HI>Wepink,</HI> and for which they pay mo&s;tly, or all in &s;trong Drink, we beg that they may be removed from that Land, and we hope care will be taken that no loo&s;e People &s;ettle on our Lands, without buying them.</P>
<P>We heartily promi&s;e our <HI>Brethren,</HI> that if any &s;trange <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hall come among us, we will immediately give Notice thereof to the next Ju&s;tice or Captain, that they may be &s;atisfied for what end they come: And if any <HI>Indian</HI> &s;hould attempt to come among us, to draw us back from our <HI>Brethren</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> we will immediately &s;ecure them, and deliver them to our <HI>Brethren.</HI> And as this is our fixed Re|&s;olution, which we de&s;ire may be made publick, we hope our <HI>Brethren</HI> will not give Credit to reports of &s;trange <HI>Indians</HI> being a|mong us, when &s;uch Stories are told by ill minded People.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007688_0008_102D999B36C3D620">
And if any of our own People &s;hould be unruly or abu&s;ive, we will deliver them up to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to be puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners then &s;poke to them as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>WE have here three Men and &s;ome Women and Children, in all Seventeen, which were taken in the upper Parts of the Pro|vince, where they have lived &s;ome Years, and &s;ent down to <HI>Trenton</HI> Gaol, for both theirs and our own Security, from whence they have been e&s;corted here, and are now in the Guard Hou&s;e, we &s;hall Order them to be delivered to you, to be examined, and if after due Care and Con|&s;ideration of this Matter, you think you can &s;afely take them a|mong you, and An&s;wer for their Good Behaviour, we will &s;hew the Confidence we have in you our <HI>Brethren,</HI> by relea&s;ing them to you; but if you &s;u&s;pect them, you mu&s;t deliver them back to the Guard. There &s;till remains in Gaol at <HI>Trenton,</HI> one <HI>Phillip</HI> an <HI>Indian,</HI> who&s;e conduct has given us great rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect him, and who&s;e Family is at <HI>Wiomen,</HI> and we &s;hall detain him there till &s;omething more appears in his favour. We &s;hall wait your An&s;wer till the Afternoon.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Friday</HI> Afternoon.</HEAD>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners and <HI>Indians</HI> being met.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;poke to them as follow.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>WE acknowledge the Kindne&s;s your Forefathers have &s;hewn to ours, and we &s;hall always Act kindly to you, as we hope you will always de&s;erve it, as long as the Waters run down <HI>Delaware.</HI></P>
<P>We are glad to find you acknowledge that your Fathers have &s;old the Land we now po&s;&s;e&s;s to our Ance&s;tors, and we hope you have received Advantages by the ri&s;ing of the Price of your Skins, and Furs, and buying what you wanted at a rea&s;onable Rate, equal to the Lo&s;s you have &s;uffered by the &s;carcity of Deer and other Game.</P>
<P>We are plea&s;ed to hear that you are &s;en&s;ible of the Evils that a|ri&s;e by the too great habit of drinking &s;pirituous Liquors among the <HI>Indians,</HI> and we &s;hall lay that Matter before the Legi&s;lature of this Provinee, and &s;hall endeavour to get a Provi&s;ion made again&s;t that Evil.</P>
<P>It is agreeable to us, to hear that you &s;o much Value the Ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel, and that it has amended the Lives of &s;o many of you, and
<PB N="9" REF="007688_0009_102D999D57FF0160">the more you practice the Precepts of it, the better it will be for you.</P>
<P>We are glad that the Lies and Fal&s;ities of your and our Enemies, have not been able to draw you off from us, your <HI>Brethren,</HI> for your true Intere&s;t is fa&s;t bound to ours.</P>
<P>As to the Bounds you have propo&s;ed for your&s;elves, we agree with you as to them, and &s;hall take care that you &s;hall be &s;ecure in them.</P>
<P>We hope none of our <HI>Brethren</HI> will di&s;tre&s;s you, unrea&s;onably, on Account of any Debts you owe them. And we recommend it to you to be Frugal and Indu&s;trious till you can pay them.</P>
<P>We will lay it before the Legi&s;lature, to provide again&s;t your be|ing deceived or defrauded in any Bargains, Grants or Lea&s;es of Land, that you may make hereafter.</P>
<P>As to your Lands at <HI>Wepink,</HI> we &s;hall make a Report about it, and you may depend upon ample Ju&s;tice being done to you.</P>
<P>We receive kindly the hearty Declarations you make to us, that you will give immediate Notice to the Officers of Government, when any &s;trange <HI>Indians</HI> come among you, and that you will &s;ecure &s;uch as are your and our Enemies. Let this lay deep in your Hearts, and your fulfilling it punctually, will give us &s;ure Proofs that you are our hearty <HI>Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>We will make the&s;e your Intentions publick, and make no doubt but this Declaration, which we believe comes from your Hearts, will make your <HI>Brethren</HI> Love and E&s;teem you, and make them unwilling to beleive any fal&s;e Reports to your di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>All manner of rude and bad behaviour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> to each other &s;hall meet with proper Di&s;couragement.</P>
<P>As &s;ome of our <HI>Brethren,</HI> have &s;u&s;tained Lo&s;&s;es by Attachment and Love to their <HI>Brethren</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> We are willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t|&s;uch of them as have left their Places of abode in their pre&s;ent Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, and &s;hall lay the Affair before the Legi&s;lature for their Con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>As to &s;uch of our <HI>Brethren</HI> the <HI>Indians,</HI> as will go out to War with our People, which we hope they will chearfully do, when there is occa&s;ion, they will always be put upon the &s;ame footing with their <HI>Brethren</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as they have been heretofore.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="007688_0010_102D999FD1D85430">
Then the <HI>Indians</HI> by <HI>Ohiockchoque</HI> return'd the following An&s;wer, to what the Commi&s;&s;ioners delivered to them this Morning.</P>
<P><HI>Dear Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>WE have con&s;idered what you &s;aid to us re&s;pecting the <HI>Indians</HI> who were bro't from the back Parts of the Province. We have &s;trictly examined them, and according to the be&s;t Judgment we are able to frame, we verily believe they had no bad de&s;igns again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> but con&s;idering the deceitfulne&s;s of Man's Heart, we dare not engage for any but our&s;elves, we would be Willing to take them to our Town at <HI>Cranberry,</HI> and do our utmo&s;t to Watch over them, but the Fears and Jealou&s;ies of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Neighbours, are &s;o great, that (as we are informed) it would not be for their or our &s;afety to have them among us, and therefore do not choo&s;e to have any Connections with them, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners afterwards enquired of the <HI>Indians,</HI> if they had the &s;ame Objections to the taking them to any of their o|ther Towns, and informed them, that the Commi&s;&s;ioners would make allowance of &s;ome <HI>Indian</HI> Corn towards their &s;upport this Winter, as they were removed from their own Habitations. Upon which <HI>Qui&s;h</HI> and the Chiefs of the <HI>Indian</HI> Town in the Branches of <HI>Cro&s;wicks,</HI> agreed, as nothing appeared again&s;t the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> but that they were brought from their Habitation for their own Security, and the Peace of the upper Inhabitants, and that they could not return there again as be|ing out of the Bounds the <HI>Indians</HI> had pre&s;cribed to them&s;elves, that they would take them home, u&s;e them as <HI>Brethren,</HI> and have a careful Eye over them.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Indian</HI> Pri&s;oners promi&s;&s;ed to keep with the <HI>Cro&s;wick Indians,</HI> and to be have orderly.</P>
<P>And they were delivered to them, who&s;e Names were <HI>Abraham Lewis, John Price, John Phillip,</HI> and Twelve Women and Children.</P>
<P>And the Commi&s;&s;ioners informed them, that they would Order &s;ome Corn for the relief of tho&s;e who have &s;uffered by their Love to us, and by being drove from their Habitations.</P>
<P>And the Treaty broke up, and the <HI>Indians</HI> next Day went in an orderly Manner to their Towns.</P>
<P><HI>What follows is added by Order of the Commi&s;&s;ioners.</HI></P>
<P>IT appeared to the Commi&s;&s;ioners in the Cour&s;e of this Treaty, that the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Su&s;quehannah,</HI> have for three or four Years pa&s;t, u&s;ed many Endeavours to carry of to <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI> all the <HI>Indians</HI> from
<PB N="11" REF="007688_0011_102D99A2663FAFE0">this Province, and have brought Belts of Wampom, in the Name of the <HI>Mohocks,</HI> to Order them to remove, tho' the <HI>Indians</HI> never be|leived them to have been &s;ent by the <HI>Mohowks,</HI> and have refu&s;ed to leave us.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners are convinced of the Sincerity of the <HI>Indians</HI> of this Province, and recommend it to the Inhabitants to u&s;e them kindly, to be careful not to &s;upply them with &s;trong Drink, where|by many di&s;orders may be prevented.</P>
<P>They al&s;o reque&s;t the Inhabitants not to u&s;e aggravating Lan|guage to the <HI>Indians,</HI> whereby rude and threatning Expre&s;&s;ions may be drawn from them in their Drink, and tho&s;e improved into Tales to alarm weak, People and rai&s;e ill Blood between the Inhabitants of the Colony and the <HI>Indians,</HI> which ought to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by all Means.</P>
<P>They recommend it to the Inhabitants to con&s;ider whether any Thing but their Love and Friend&s;hip to us, could have prevented their being new among our Enemies, and for this token of their Af|fection for us, they are intitled to our Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>As the &s;preading of reports, without a good Foundation, can only &s;erve to give the Inhabitants unea&s;ine&s;s, they reque&s;t them carefully to &s;uppre&s;s all Idle Stories, as they will tend to de&s;troy their own Quiet and Repo&s;e.</P>
