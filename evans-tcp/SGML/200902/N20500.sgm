<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the writing the following di&s;cour&s;e and prayer, the publi&s;her has been greatly &s;olicited by many of the auditors, for copies thereof.</P>
<P>Therefore in pur&s;uance to the repeated reque&s;ts that has been made, the publi&s;her hath made u&s;e of the pre&s;s to convey the &s;ame to the public with hopes it may be u&s;eful to &s;ome and that no di&s;ad|vantage will en&s;ue to any individual.</P>
<P>The publi&s;hing of good books hath oftentimes been of great &s;ervice, nay, hath been the means of kindling a holy fire in the hearts of the luke|warm.</P>
<P>It cannot be expected that the reading of the following di&s;cour&s;e will be attended with the &s;ame power, as at the time of delivery, except being touch'd by that power which cau&s;ed them to flow forth</P>
<P>It is not the province of the editor to &s;ay much or to multiply words, but hopes the en&s;uing di&s;|cour&s;e and prayer may be read with a &s;olid and &s;ober mind.</P>
<P>It is the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of every one, to be careful how they handle the golden ve&s;&s;els (holy

<P>I therefore &s;hall leave the i&s;&s;ue to the all-wi&s;e di&s;|po&s;er of all good things.</P>
<P>The publi&s;her having not &s;een the author of the fol|lowing di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ince &s;he delivered it, the public cannot expect to have her approbation for publi&s;h|ing the &s;ame; but he hath &s;hewn it to many who were pre&s;ent at the time of delivery, and they are unanimous in their opinion it is the &s;ub&s;tance of what they heard.</P>

<P>IF I mi&s;take not, our dear Lord and Saviour, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, both he and his di&s;ciples that were with him, were invited to a marriage that was to be in Cana of Galilee, which place he graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to honour with his heavenly pre|&s;ence; and even there manife&s;ted him&s;elf by his omnipotent and divine power, in a mo&s;t wonderful and miraculous man|ner.</P>
<P>Since my &s;itting down here among&s;t you in this meeting, the thoughts of it came into my mind, without the lea&s;t &s;tudy or premeditation. I could not be &s;ilent, thinking it to be my duty, in obedience to the divine will; for I de&s;ired not the &s;ound of my voice to be heard, but would much rather hear than be heard; but apprehending it to be my duty, as that eminent apo&s;tle and &s;ervant of our Lord did, to whom a di&s;|pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel was commited; who &s;aid, <HI>Woe be unto me if I preach not the go&s;pel!</HI> I heartily wi&s;h, and it is the earne&s;t de&s;ire of my mind, that tho&s;e that are now concerned, may be &s;olicitous; and O! that it may be the concern of eve|ry individual, that is here pre&s;ent, to invite this heavenly gue&s;t, that we all might be favoured with his heavenly pre|&s;ence, and made to partake of his divine comforts. If we were thus &s;olicitous and engaged in our minds, we might have great rea&s;on to expect his gracious pre&s;ence to be with us, as he our dear Lord hath promi&s;ed, &s;aying; <HI>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there will I be, and ble&s;s them.
<PB N="6" REF="026895_0005_0FD24B95F0D45208">
Where&s;oever two or three are gathered together in my name</HI> (that is, my power) <HI>there will I be in the mid&s;t of them, and I will ble&s;s them.</HI> What wonderful conde&s;cen&s;ion is this to his children and people, to be &s;o highly favoured with his heavenly prefence!</P>
<P>In this he fulfils his promi&s;e which he hath made to his di&s;ciples, as he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in another place, &s;aying <HI>I and my Father will come and &s;up with them, and we will make our abode with them.</HI> O! ble&s;&s;ed inhabitant, and heavenly gue&s;t! O! that it may be the happy experience of the pre&s;ent parties here concerned, and that they may be favoured with the heavenly manife&s;tation of divine love, that they may witne&s;s his &s;tupendous power to vi&s;it, pre|&s;erve, guide and direct them!</P>
<P>We find that at the marriage in Cana there was to be a watch. <HI>What&s;oever he bids you do, that do.</HI> Here they were to watch for the divine command. O! that we may be all a watching and have our eye to him that is both willing and able to help, and is &s;trength in weakne&s;s and riches in poverty; that we may adhere to his hea|venly teaching, which is found to them that &s;eek him, as he him&s;elf hath graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed who &s;aid, <HI>He that &s;eeketh me, &s;hall find me, and he that cometh to me I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t off.</HI> Here our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;heweth his un&s;peak|able love to the &s;ons and daughters of men, to be thus gra|ciou&s;ly vi&s;ited by the Lord of life and glory! O! that thou, O Lord may be invited! and O! that it may be the &s;olicitation of every mind that is here met, and are anxi|ous to hear what may be &s;poken; that, by and through thy inward appearance in their hearts, they may be brought to know and experience thy divine will. This was the &s;hort prayer of my &s;pirit &s;ince my &s;itting down among you. I heartily wi&s;h it was the concern of every one that is here. If it was the concern of us all, we &s;hould have cau&s;e to rejoice in our coming together: and it would do our &s;ouls good to be thus favoured by Divine Love, who is the Lord from Heaven, the Quickening Spirit, the God of Truth. O! may there be a true and zealous labouring and working to &s;eek to him. O! may we be favoured with his heavenly company, that we may come to know him to be with us; and have the happy ex|perience
<PB N="7" REF="026895_0006_0FD24B974D8E0FF0">
to witne&s;s his power, and ta&s;te of his ble&s;&s;ing. By this experience we &s;hall come to know his heavenly power to pre&s;erve, and his divine in&s;truction to teach us, who &s;peaks as never man &s;poke, who is the Wonderful Coun&s;ellor, the Mighty God, and Prince of Peace, the Everla&s;ting Father, and of the increa&s;e of his government there &s;hall never be an end.</P>
<P>Now what great advantage would this be to the children of men, to know and witne&s;s this great power to rule and reign in them, who&s;e right it is to rule and reign; and have the experience of his love and favour, who is the Mighty God, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; that He might take upon him the government and direct us in his ways.</P>
<P>As we come under his government, and are obedient to his divine and heavenly in&s;tructions, we &s;hall come to know his kingdom to be come, and his will to be done in us as it is in heaven; and have that excellent prayer of our Lord an|&s;wered; <HI>Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as is done in heaven.</HI> O! what an excellent and heavenly expe|rience it is to have the mind re&s;igned to the will of our heavenly father! to know the kingdom of God to be come in righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t? O! the heavenly rectitude of mind the people of God enjoy! what &s;weet tranquility of mind do they po&s;&s;e&s;s where the kingdom of God is come? where righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace is known? and where the Lord Je&s;us rules and reigns?</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved before, that at the marriage which the Lord honoured with his pre&s;ence, they had a watch. The &s;ervants that attended, were to watch and obey the orders given them, which was, <HI>What&s;oever he bids you do, that do.</HI> And they waited for the divine command. Now, here was the advantage they had that were waiting upon the Lord: by their waiting and watching they come to know the Lord's will, and obey his orders.</P>
<P>We find that, at the marriage, there was a want of wine. What was the expre&s;&s;ion to the &s;ervants that attended? It was, <HI>What&s;oever he bids do, that do.</HI> And we may re|member they were ordered to put water into the pots, which were not to be handed forth till he ordered: and they
<PB N="8" REF="026895_0007_0FD24B99EFB420B0">
waited for the divine command. Here our Lord &s;hewed his miraculous power. Here it was our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord made the water wine, and then ordered the &s;ervants that waited to hand it forth. Ob&s;erve. The water was fir&s;t made wine by a miraculous and divine power. It was then, and not be|fore the &s;ervants had to hand it to the company that was pre&s;ent. How gracious was our Lord, how great was his power, in &s;hewing forth this miracle? I could not but ad|mire his great love and wonderful conde&s;cen&s;ion to man|kind!</P>
<P>Now, let us ob&s;erve the expre&s;&s;ion in the orders given, which was, <HI>What&s;oever he bids you do, that do.</HI> And he di|rected the water that had been made wine, to be handed to the governor of the fea&s;t, that he might ta&s;te it; and he ta&s;ted it, and tho&s;e that were at the marriage. What was then expre&s;&s;ed? It was <HI>The la&s;t wine is the be&s;t.</HI> O Friends, I cannot but admire the great love and conde&s;cen&s;ion of our dear Lord, in be&s;towing his gifts to his children and people; how he manife&s;ted his power among&s;t them; and how conde&s;cending he is to tho&s;e who are anxious to know the water being made wine, that the &s;pirits of the contrite might be revived, and tho&s;e that are ready to faint might be refre&s;hed by the handing forth of divine love, which is the wine of his kingdom, prepared and given by him that is &s;trenth in weakne&s;s and riches in poverty. Our own &s;trength as men and creatures, is as water, be our educa|cation ever &s;o high, and our wi&s;dom but fooli&s;hne&s;s. It is like water and not wine, be it ever &s;o excellent, till taught of the Lord by his in&s;peaking word. The Lord he prepares it. It is his power alone, which is the &s;ame that it ever was, that tho&s;e who are truly concerned, come to know and witne&s;s a true and peaceable tranquility of mind. O that his company may be rightly and truly &s;ought after, that all tho&s;e that are here pre&s;ent may be &s;olicitous to hear his voice, which &s;peaketh as never man &s;poke; that every one may attend to his divine teaching and hea|venly in&s;truction: that they may ta&s;te of the wine of his preparing, and when he orders his &s;ervants to hand it forth to the people, they may have it to &s;ay (from a true and real experience,) <HI>The la&s;t wine is the be&s;t.</HI> This has been the concern of my &s;pirit among you, that you may wit|ne&s;s his power to be with you, and in the mid&s;t of you. It is
<PB N="9" REF="026895_0008_0FD24B99F4BCBF68">
his power only can do it. It is his power alone that can effect it.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes thought the Lord is wonderfully mani|fe&s;ting his power, even to the working of miracles. It is he that is the cau&s;e of the water being made wine, not tho&s;e that hand it forth. If he doth not prepare it, if he doth not make it, and if he doth not order it to be given, it is but water and not wine, which cannot profit the people. It is not the quantity but the quality that can &s;atisfy tho&s;e that are &s;eeking the Lord for divine help and &s;trength. This has been upon my mind as I have been engaged a|mong&s;t you: and I think it was in &s;ome degree a miracle.</P>
<P>I do not want to monopolize other per&s;ons places, or to take up the room of any other here. I could be more wil|ling to hear than to &s;peak; but, methinks when I feel of the water being made wine, I dare not but hand forth a little of the divine ble&s;&s;ing, in order that the gue&s;ts which have been here invited, may partake of the heavenly wine. The Lord prepares it him&s;elf. He is inviting his children to come and refre&s;h them&s;elves with the wine of his king|dom. O, if people did but &s;ee, if their minds were right|ly concerned; and if there was but a true &s;eeking to him, there would be a ta&s;ting of the wine of his preparing.</P>
<P>O that the eye of the mind was but &s;ingle to him, and to his dear Son our Lord, in whom the father is well plea|&s;ed, who &s;aid, <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed!</HI> It is my &s;incere de&s;ire that there may be a hearkening to him, and a hearing of his heavenly voice, that you may come to be acquainted with him, and obey his voice that is the true Mini&s;ter of the Sanctuary and Bi&s;hop of his Church and People, whom God the Father &s;ends, is the earne&s;t prayer of my &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Now, if the eye were &s;ingle to him, and our expectations from him, and not from the arm of fle&s;h; we &s;hould know the Lord Je&s;us, who is all-powerful to be our redeemer. I &s;ay, if there was but a hearing of the voice of him, whom the prophet &s;pake of, &s;aying. <HI>A prophet &s;hall the Lord your God rai&s;e up, like unto me. Him &s;hall you hear in all things; and he that doth not hear him, &s;hall be cut off from among his people.</HI> If we did but hear and obey God, we &s;hould come to know his power to be among&s;t us. O that there may be a tru&s;ting in the Lord, and a dependance on his &s;pirit and power to teach and in&s;truct us, is the earne&s;t concern
<PB N="10" REF="026895_0009_0FD24B9B0F7F7FB0">
of my mind. Is is he that &s;peaketh truth and no lie, for he is a God of Truth.</P>
<P>As we come to be dive&s;ted of Self, as there is no leaning on our own under&s;tanding, [<HI>Lean not to your own under&s;tand|ing, but tru&s;t in the Lord</HI> (&s;aid an eminent &s;ervant of God) <HI>tru&s;t in the Lord, and he will help thee</HI>] not to lean on words nor the acquired arts and parts of the creature, be them ever &s;o high and excellent; but in true humility of mind, with a perfect re&s;ignation to his will, to wait upon the Lord for his divine appearance in your hearts; for it is they that &s;eek him &s;hall find him: the humble he will teach his way, and the meek he will guide in judgment. It is them he will fill with his heavenly oil; and tho&s;e that thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s he will fill with his heavenly wine.</P>
<P>But O Friends! there mu&s;t be a watchfulne&s;s and a care not to lean on our own under&s;tanding, or on our own cogi|tations, that is &s;o apt to fill the mind. If we come to expe|rience this, O how &s;hall we be taught of the Lord! taught by him that is truth and no lie, for he is a God of Truth.</P>
<P>It is the true and humble &s;eeking &s;oul &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed of the Lord, and tho&s;e that hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;|ne&s;s; it is they and they only, that &s;hall obtain the pro|mi&s;e, <HI>Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord;</HI> but the rich and full they &s;hall be &s;ent empty away. Tho&s;e that think great of their abilities, and they that are lifted up in their own imaginations, they are tho&s;e that &s;hall be &s;ent empty away. The ability is not in man, nor is the &s;trength in the creature, but it is in the God of Truth. Great is the God of Truth! The Lord from Heaven is above all Gods, and above all beings and principalities, both in Heaven and Earth. Ble&s;&s;ed be the God of truth! It is He that teach|eth the people truth, and brings them to be acquainted with him&s;elf. It is by the manife&s;tation of Chri&s;t Je&s;us the truth is come to be known, as he him&s;elf hath expre&s;&s;ed, &s;aying, <HI>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. I am the way; nor is there any other way to come to the Father, for there is no other name given among&s;t men, but the name of Chri&s;t, whereby mankind can be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>It is Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which is Life and Truth, that would rai&s;e us from &s;in and death to a life of righteou&s;ne&s;s. If there was but a &s;eeking to him, and a de&s;ire to be taught by him, what advantage would we then receive! Our &s;orrow would be then turned into joy, and our weakne&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="026895_0010_0FD24B9C8CB73408">
into &s;trength; we &s;hould then come to know the promi&s;e of the Lord to be riches in poverty, and &s;trength in all our weakne&s;s. All tho&s;e that do put their tru&s;t in him, and have an eye &s;ingle to him, that are &s;olicitous for his divine in&s;truction, and &s;eek him with all their whole heart, who &s;eeks the doctrine from his mouth, &s;hall be made to know him that is the God of Truth. If thine eye be &s;ingle to him, thy whole body &s;hall be full of light; that is, if thou art &s;ingly looking to God, and to his divine appearance in thine own heart, thou &s;halt come to know him that is God, whom to know is life eternal, and be made acquainted with his truth; for what is to be known of God, is made manife&s;t in man. (This is &s;cripture doctrine.) It is there he is manife&s;ting and revealing him&s;elf again&s;t &s;in and wickedne&s;s, and again&s;t every evil way.</P>
<P>He that maketh manife&s;t is light, and in him there is no darkne&s;s at all. If thine eye be &s;ingle, thy whole body &s;hall be full of light; thou &s;halt &s;ee what the Lord would have thee to do, and what to leave undone. In him there is no confu&s;ion, but the confu&s;ion is in the creature, for want of &s;ingly looking to God; and this want is the cau&s;e of the want of a true devotion to, and wor&s;hipping God aright, who is to be wor&s;hipped in &s;pirit and in truth; for &s;uch doth the father &s;eek to wor&s;hip him. There mu&s;t be no dependance on fle&s;h and blood; for fle&s;h and blood &s;hall never enter into heaven. The apo&s;tle Paul conferred not with fle&s;h and blood, but gave up freely to the heavenly vi&s;ion, to the in&s;truction of the Spirit of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, as him&s;elf hath &s;aid. <HI>I conferred not</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>with fle&s;h and blood, but &s;traightway gave up to the heavenly vi&s;ion.</HI> He did not receive the go&s;pel from man, but from the Lord from Heaven. Ob&s;erve how bold he &s;peaks his own expe|rience, <HI>I conferred not with fle&s;h and blood. I received it not from man, but by adhering to the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the heavenly in&s;tructor; who is the way, the truth, and the light, that enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world; who is the Lord from Heaven, and King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI></P>
<P>We find that it was given to the apo&s;tle ju&s;t mentioned, to preach Chri&s;t Je&s;us to the Jews as well as the Gentiles; though to the Jews he was a &s;tumbling-block and to the Gentiles fooli&s;hne&s;s. It was by obedience and a re&s;ignation
<PB N="12" REF="026895_0011_0FD24BA4F1BABA68">
to the divine truth revealed in him, that he became an ex|cellent in&s;trument in the hand of God, to di&s;courage vice and immorality, and had to preach righteou&s;ne&s;s; for it is the Righteous, my friends, that exalteth a nation, but Sin is a &s;hame to any people. This is in&s;truction to mankind. This is what the Apo&s;tle of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord had to di&s;tri|bute. It was the great bu&s;ine&s;s his Ma&s;ter &s;ent him to do, to preach righteou&s;ne&s;s and di&s;courage immorality, that Sin might be put an end to, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s (which ex|alteth a nation) be e&s;tabli&s;hed. This was the end for which Chri&s;t came into the world, and was prophe&s;ied of him; and that a long time before he came in that prepared body which he received of the Father; that he was to put an end to &s;in and fini&s;h tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and in the room there|of to e&s;tabli&s;h everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Now, if ever the work of righteou&s;ne&s;s is done, if ever it be rightly and truly performed, it mu&s;t be begun at home, in our own hearts; for (ob&s;erve) Chri&s;t came to take away &s;in, and in the room thereof to e&s;tabli&s;h ever|la&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s. We may al&s;o take notice of another expre&s;&s;ion of an eminent &s;ervant of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, that God <HI>&s;o loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son</HI>&mdash; (what for?)&mdash;<HI>to take away &s;in, in order that he might redeem to him&s;elf a peculiar and holy people, zealous of good works.</HI> How can we but be concerned that the glorious end for which Chri&s;t came, might be an&s;wered; that &s;in, which is a &s;hame, might be put an end to, and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion fini&s;hed, that righteou&s;ne&s;s which exalteth a nation be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>If we were truly &s;incere, if we were true mini&s;ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, how anxious would we be, how zealou&s;ly would we labour, that &s;in might be put an end to, and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion fini&s;hed! There is no room left for &s;in, nor place for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; but the Lord directs to righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord with comfort; for the Lord is of purer eyes than to behold ini|quity with approbation. There is no people that are &s;o beloved of the Lord, that he can approve of &s;in in them. It is not forms or modes of religion, or a formal righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, nor the inventions of men will do; but it is through obedience and &s;anctification we are made righte|ous; and by being wa&s;hed with the water of regeneration we come to be clean&s;ed from &s;in and pollution.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="026895_0012_0FD24BA744611030">If we come to be beloved of the Lord, it mu&s;t be by experiencing his love in us, and being obedient to his hea|venly will. It is the obedient &s;oul &s;hall live. It is he that &s;hall eat the good of the land, and drink of the wine of his kingdom. All tho&s;e that do his will &s;hall know of his doctrine.

If we were &s;olicitous enough for this, what a divine energy and &s;trength would be put into our minds, that everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s might be brought in, and the kingdom of Chri&s;t be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>If we were true Chri&s;tians taught of the Lord, and &s;o|licitous for his honour, we &s;hould be made to know more and more, and be made ready to open to him, and will|ing to take on us his heavenly yoke, that would yoke us to his cro&s;s, and draw our inclinations to him&s;elf. <HI>It is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth,</HI> &s;aith the Scripture of truth. Here is a beautiful compari&s;on. It is compared to a yoke of young oxen that are yoked together, and are taught to draw, which they cannot do till they obey the yoke. It is as we come under the divine yoke, and are yoked to his cro&s;s, and made to obey, we are taught to draw and become &s;erviceable in the creation, and u&s;eful to one another; for he is only fit to live, who is fit to die. For this very end have we a being in the world, that we might glorify God, who gives us life, breath and being. This has been the concern of my mind &s;ince I entered this city, in the love of my heavenly Father, to call unto the inhabitants thereof, that they might eat of the fruit of in|&s;truction, which is the way to life, and become obedient to the voice of wi&s;dom, which is calling them in the &s;ecret of their hearts. The Lord in his mercy, is calling unto the &s;ons and daughters of men; he is calling them from dark|ne&s;s to light, from the power of &s;in and Satan to &s;erve the living God. I cannot but admire his un&s;peakable love and wonderful mercy that he be&s;tows on his people! Methinks there is a door of mercy open, which none can &s;hut but he that has the key of David, who openeth and none can &s;hut, and &s;hutteth and none can open. A door of mercy is open, and mercy is handing forth; and if there be not a comply|ing,
<PB N="14" REF="026895_0013_0FD24BA88AB13A78">
if there be not a coming up in obedience to righteou&s;|ne&s;s, the door of mercy will be &s;hut. This is plainly &s;et forth in the parable of the virgins.</P>
<P>We may remember, that when the bridegroom came, the fooli&s;h virgins had no oil in their lamps; and they &s;aid unto the wi&s;e, <HI>Give us of your oil.</HI> What was the an&s;wer of the wi&s;e? It was a very rea&s;onable one,&mdash;<HI>Not &s;o, le&s;t there be not enough for you and us. Go and buy for your&s;elves. And when they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with them, and the door was &s;hut;</HI> and an an&s;wer was made to the fooli&s;h virgins, when they wanted to enter, <HI>I know you not.</HI> A di&s;mal &s;entence it was, and will be pronounced to the wicked,&mdash;<HI>Depart from me, I know you not.</HI> I hope that this may never be the ca&s;e of any that are here. The fooli&s;h had a name to virgins as well as the wi&s;e; but that would no<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> get them an entrance. Though they had a name to virgins, it did not prevent the an&s;wer, <HI>I know you not.</HI> Ob&s;erve: Here was both a name and profe&s;&s;ion to religion. Both had the name to virgins but the fooli&s;h wanted oil: they wanted righteou&s;ne&s;s. The time was elap&s;ed; the door of mercy was &s;hut; an an&s;wer was made; and a woeful &s;entence pronounced,&mdash; <HI>Depart from me&punc; I know you not.</HI></P>
<P>You have heard of him that &s;peaketh as never man &s;poke, who &s;peaketh in the &s;ecret of your hearts. But though you have heard, you may be no better than he that built his hou&s;e upon the &s;and. When the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that hou&s;e, it fell, becau&s;e it was not built upon a rock. So will it be with tho&s;e who tru&s;t to a name of religion, and a formal righteou&s;ne&s;s, but neglect to come up in obedience to the word of grace in their hearts. I hope, and I earne&s;tly pray, that this may never happen to any that is in the hearing of my voice. The Lord, in his mercy ble&s;s you and keep you: may his infinite power pre&s;erve and protect you!</P>
<P>But he that built his hou&s;e on the rock, when the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that hou&s;e, it fell not, becau&s;e it was built upon a rock; &s;o will he &s;tand who builds on the divine rock, Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Son of God, and &s;ure foundation. Again&s;t him the gates of Hell &s;hall never prevail. The floods may come and the winds may blow, and waves of temptation may rai&s;e them&s;elves high,

he &s;hall &s;tand in the day of trial, becau&s;e he is built on the Divine and Eternal Rock.</P>
<P>Therefore let none deceive them&s;elves, for <HI>&s;uch as you &s;ow, &s;uch &s;hall you reap.</HI> If you &s;ow to the &s;pirit, you &s;hall of the &s;pirit reap life everla&s;ting; but if you &s;ow to the fle&s;h, a mi&s;erable crop &s;hall you reap. It is by experiencing the work of righteou&s;ne&s;s wrought in us we come to ta&s;te of the ble&s;&s;ing; and <HI>O that it may be the ca&s;e!</HI> is the earne&s;t pray|er that accompanies my mind; and that you may know his gracious favour and mercy to be with you, and keep you! Suppo&s;e I &s;hould &s;ay it hath attended me here, for which my &s;oul doth ble&s;s the Lord, who hath come down to his people, and is making his power known in ble&s;&s;ing the pro|vi&s;ion of Zion. We cannot but wor&s;hip at the throne of his foot&s;tool, who is God over all, ble&s;&s;ed in him&s;elf.

<P>BE plea&s;ed, O Lord! to prepare our hearts, and put into our minds, to commemorate thy goodne&s;s.

Thy truth is gone forth, and we cannot forbear to be&s;eech thee, in behalf of mankind all the world over (let their names or profe&s;&s;ion be what it may) that thou&s;ands or tens of thou&s;ands may be brought home by thy Son; and that thou would&s;t make thy&s;elf known by manife&s;ting thy&s;elf to them. Be plea&s;ed to re|member, in mercy, tho&s;e that have much thought of thy name, and al&s;o tho&s;e that have not enquired after thee; that by and through the di&s;covery of thy light, O Lord God of Truth, they may come to &s;ee thy &s;acred truth, and be made to follow thee where&s;oever thou goe&s;t, that thy name, which is holy, may be glorified.

<HEAD><HI>SOME ACCOUNT OF</HI> ISAAC SHOEMAKER, <HI>OF THE</HI> Town&s;hip of Cheltenham, in the County of Philadelphia (Son of <HI>JOHN SHOEMAKER</HI> of the &s;ame Place) who departed this Life on the <HI>31</HI>&s;t Day of the &s;eventh Month <HI>1779,</HI> in the twenty fifth Year of his Age.</HEAD>
<P>HE was a young man of an active di&s;po&s;ition and vigourous con&s;titution, who in the general tenor of his conduct and conver&s;ation was pre&s;erved from what in the world's e&s;timati|on is accounted gro&s;s or immoral; yet in his company, dre&s;s and deportment evidence a leaning to levity, and fond|ne&s;s for things in their nature vain and un&s;ub&s;tantial; of the emptine&s;s and corrupting tendency whereof he was at time made &s;en&s;ible, by the faithful admonitions of the Divine Mo|nitor in his own mind, as appears from &s;ome of his expre&s;&s;ions near his departure out of time; when through the renewed extendings of heavenly favour, he was mercifully vi&s;ited and awakened from a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility; under the quickening influences whereof, he had to warn and admoni&s;h his former a&s;&s;ociates and others, again&s;t indulging them&s;elves in the va|nities and folies of a peri&s;hing world; &s;ome of whom having been mea&s;ureably reached thereby, have &s;ignified a de&s;ire that the weighty expre&s;&s;ions uttered by him in that &s;olemn &s;ea|&s;on, might be communicated and diffu&s;ed for the benefit of the youth of his acquaintance and others; which if weighed with becoming &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and depth of attention, might mini&s;ter profitable in&s;truction, and tend to la&s;ting edification. This in&s;tance of heavenly conde&s;cention and divine regard affording renewed cau&s;e in humble admiration to &s;ay,
<Q>Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty! ju&s;t and true are thy ways thou King of Saints!
<BIBL>Rev. xv. 3.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="026895_0018_0FD24BB4C7C1FE10">About ten days before his decea&s;e, between the hours of eight and nine in the evening he fell into a &s;tate of &s;ilence, and became &s;peechle&s;s and incapable of bodily action, his mouth being open and his jaw &s;et: thus he lay nearly three hours, &s;uppo&s;ed by the family and divers of the neighbours pre&s;ent, to be in a trance. Upon his recovery, he ground his teeth together, &s;o as greatly to affect the hearers, and twice or thrice &s;ighed deeply. After which, appearing like one rai&s;ed from the dead, under great concern and exerci&s;e of mind, he began to &s;peak with a &s;trong voice, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of tho&s;e in company; &s;aying,
<Q>Oh! that I could tell you what I have &s;een and underwent. It would pierce the harde&s;t heart among&s;t you; perhaps &s;ome may think there is no hell, but I have to tell you there is a hell, and a dreadful one too; and the grinding of my teeth is nothing to the grinding and gna&s;hing of teeth in hell. And there is a heaven and a &s;weet one too; where angels cloathed in white robes &s;it at the right hand of God &s;inging prai&s;es to his great name; I have to declare it unto you at the peril of my &s;oul, but &s;ome will not believe though an apo&s;tle &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead. You may think I am not in my &s;en&s;es, but I knew you all as you came into the room, am perfectly in my &s;en&s;es, and God hath opened my mouth on your account, and that you might declare it unto others. Narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it; but broad is the way that leads to de&s;truction, and many are going in that way.</Q>
(Proceeding in a bemoaning accent.)
<Q>I have lived to this age without knowing what God real|ly is, until this night. I have been often vi&s;ited, but did kick and rebel. Three years ago, I had a &s;ight that I &s;hould be brought to the brink of the grave, but it was not &s;hewn me whether I &s;hould recover or not; but if I do, I am de&s;irous that I might be made an in&s;trument to convert thou&s;ands into the right way. I wonder (con|tinued he) that I &s;hould undertake to be the head of a family and not capable to teach them their duty towards God: there is a nece&s;&s;ity for parents and heads of fami|lies to bring up their children and others under their care, in plainne&s;s of &s;peech and apparel, keeping humble, en|deavouring to impre&s;s their tender minds with a &s;en&s;e of their duty towards God. Many let their children run about the &s;treets, hearing (which is often u&s;ed in this land) the holy name of Je&s;us taken in vain. My parents
<PB N="3" REF="026895_0019_0FD24BB9807D55F0">
when I was young, were drawn &s;o much into the cumber|ing things of this world, that they did not teach me as they ought to have done my duty towards God.</Q>
To his wife he uttered him&s;elf thus:
<Q>My dear con&s;ort, my bo&s;om friend, mourn not for me, there are many diffi|culties and trials to be met with in our pa&s;&s;ing through this world; retire to thy father's hou&s;e, live a &s;ober, virtuous life. If it &s;hould plea&s;e God to take me out of the world this night, I would have none to take it to heart; no, not to &s;hed a tear.</Q>
He was divers times drawn forth in fervent &s;upplication, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf
on this wi&s;e:<Q> Oh! Lord Je&s;us, be plea&s;ed to look down with an eye of pity upon me; on my father, be with him and comfort him in his old age, under the afflic|tions and trials that may be &s;uffered to come upon him&punc; On my aged mother, be her &s;trength and &s;upport all the days of her life; who has been a kind and tender mother to me, all my days; and hath &s;ince my &s;ickne&s;s, in my di&s;tre&s;s, pointed out the right path for me to turn into, when I was ready to fall into de&s;pair, under a &s;en&s;e of my manifold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, directing me to look forward towards my dear Redeemer, who&s;e blood is &s;ufficient to wa&s;h away all our &s;ins, which I have experienced the truth of. Be plea&s;ed, if it be thy will, look down upon mankind univer&s;ally, reconcile all men to one another and to thy&s;elf, that there may be no more blood &s;pilt in the land, if it be thy ble&s;&s;ed will; not my will, but thine be done.</Q>
Al&s;o &s;inging prai&s;es to God for his many great mercies to him.</P>
<P>Being de&s;irous of &s;eeing divers of his acquaintance not pre&s;ent, he &s;aid:
<Q>They know not what God really is; &s;ome of them have in their brea&s;ts the &s;pirit of envy and bitterne&s;s.</Q>
Under much concern that they may be re|deemed from that wrathful &s;pirit, he earne&s;tly be&s;ought the Almighty to turn their hearts to love and good will.
<Q>I wonder, (&s;aid he) that God hath not &s;ent his ju&s;t judg|ments and de&s;troyed this place, for wickedne&s;s and hard|ne&s;s of heart.</Q>
He de&s;ired to be made &s;ubject to the divine will, and &s;aid,
<Q>I have no will of my own, not my will but thine be done.</Q> To his brothers he &s;aid, <Q>Remem+ber your Creator in the days of your youth, dre&s;s plain and walk humble before the Lord; never mind what your comrades &s;ay&punc; for we mu&s;t all become fools for Chri&s;t's

&s;ake, that we may be made wi&s;e. Make Him your &s;tand|ard, keep the world under your feet; attend meetings with your father and mother both on fir&s;t and other days of the week; when met, turn your minds inward and &s;olidly think what you came about, and endeavour to know God for your&s;elves; do not as I have done; I of|ten went to meetings and &s;ometimes did think on tho&s;e things, but &s;oon let them &s;lip, letting my mind out at fine cloaths and gay dre&s;s, contriving how to exceed in grandeur.</Q>
To his apprentice boy he &s;aid,
<Q>I have heard thee u&s;e many idle words and pa&s;&s;ed it by without proper notice, I beg thee may break thy&s;elf of them, or God will pronounce his judgments again&s;t thee.</Q>
de&s;iring the company to withdraw out of the room and to be left alone in &s;tillne&s;s, he &s;aid,
<Q>I think I have done with fle&s;h, I have &s;aid all that I have to &s;ay unto you;</Q> then lifting too his hands he &s;aid, <Q>Oh! holy Je&s;us how &s;weet do I feel thee!</Q>
All being gone out of the room, he devout|ly and loudly de&s;ired (in the hearing of &s;ome friends in the adjoining room) that God might be plea&s;ed to &s;top the ef|fu&s;ion of blood.</P>
<P>After which he appeared like one who&s;e mind is redeemed from the earth and much &s;wallowed up in a &s;en&s;e of that &s;weetne&s;s he had been &s;o marvellou&s;ly favoured with; con|tinuing in this frame of &s;pirit to the clo&s;e of his time; and we doubt not but he now re&s;ts in peace and quiet with the Lord.</P>

<P>'Many are often alarmed in con&s;cience hereby the word and voice of God, who &s;top the ears and &s;light tho&s;e warn|ings; but the great and final alarm of the la&s;t trumpet they cannot &s;top their ears again&s;t, nor e&s;cape it. It will unavoida|bly &s;eize upon and further waken them finally to judgment: They that will not be alarmed in their con&s;ciences unto re|pentances, nor out of their &s;ins here, mu&s;t certainly be a|larmed to judgment hereafter.'</P>

<P>'And tho' many now evade and reject the inward con|victions and judgments of the light, and &s;hut up the records or books thereof in their own con&s;ciences, they &s;hall all be at la&s;t opened, and every one judged of the&s;e things record|ed therein and according to their works.
