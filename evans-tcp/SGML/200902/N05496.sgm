<P>_A Sen&s;e of the great Evil of Sin, is e&s;&s;ential to true Repentance. It may be laid down as a general <HI>Maxim,</HI> that "we cannot be &s;ui|tably affected towards Things, unle&s;s we &s;ee them as they are." Be they, on the one Hand, ever &s;o amiable and lovely, yet if their Beauty is not &s;een, our Hearts will be untouch'd. Even the infinite Glory and Excellence of GOD will not excite our E&s;teem and Love, if we have no Sen&s;e of it: And let the moral Beauty of the divine Government be ever &s;o great, altho' it may ravi&s;h the heavenly World, who &s;ee it, yet we, while blind to it, &s;hall be wholly unmoved: And be the Go&s;pel-way of Salvation, by free Grace thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> ever &s;o glorious, yet if the Glories of it are not di&s;cern'd, we may be far from admiring that divine Con&s;titution.&mdash; So, on the other Hand, let <HI>Sin</HI> be ever &s;o great an Evil, yet if the great Evil of it is not &s;een, we &s;hall never be &s;uitably affected towards it. Tho' it de&s;erves to be hated ever &s;o much, and tho' there be ever &s;o great Rea&s;on that we &s;hould be humbled and aba&s;ed before God on the Account of it, and mourn in the Bitterne&s;s of our Hearts for it, and be a|fraid of, and watch again&s;t it, as the greate&s;t of Evils;
<PB N="2" REF="006963_0004_102AD2FE8B3AB1E0">yet we &s;hall not, unle&s;s it be &s;een as it is. Did we &s;ee it perfectly as it is, we &s;hould feel towards it perfectly as we ought: But unle&s;s we &s;ee it in &s;ome Mea&s;ure as it is, we &s;hall feel towards it in no Mea&s;ure as we ought.&mdash;So that a Sen&s;e of the great Evil of Sin is plainly e&s;&s;ential to true Repen|tance.&mdash;And, indeed, it is that, from which Repentance does nextly and mo&s;t immediately take its Ri&s;e. Love to God, Faith in Chri&s;t, and Hope in the Mercy of God thro' Him, prepare and di&s;po&s;e the Heart to mourn for Sin: But it's a Sen&s;e of the great Evil of Sin, which immediately affects the Heart with Sorrow, and humbles and aba&s;es the Soul before the Lord.&mdash;<HI>My Sin is ever before me&mdash; Again&s;t Thee have I &s;inned&mdash;Thou art ju&s;t, when thou &s;peake&s;t&mdash;Have Mercy upon me, O God.</HI> So al&s;o St. <HI>Paul,&mdash;The Law is &s;piri|tual&mdash;I am carnal, &s;old under Sin&mdash;Oh, wretched Man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me!</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 14, 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now,</P>
<P>The Evil of Sin ari&s;es from our Obligations to do other|wi&s;e. And the more &s;trongly we are obliged to do our Duty, the more wicked is it in us to neglect it, or go contrary to it,&mdash;and the more are we to blame,&mdash;and the greater Cau&s;e have we to be &s;orry and penitent.</P>
<P>We may be under various Kinds of Obligations to the Practice of Virtue. The Honour and Authority of God may oblige us&mdash;The Welfare of our Fellow-Creatures may oblige us&mdash;and our own pre&s;ent and future Happine&s;s may oblige us too: and therefore we may be to blame, and have Cau&s;e of Repentance, on &s;everal Accounts; and that, for the Evil contained in one particular Action, viewed in various Re&s;pects, as it is&mdash; again&s;t God&mdash;our Fellow-Men&mdash;or our own Intere&s;t, for this World and the next.&mdash;And as is our Sen&s;e of the&s;e Things, &s;o &s;hall we be affected; i. e. we &s;hall be &s;orry and blame our &s;elves accordingly.</P>
<P>For let our Obligations be ever &s;o great; yet, if they are not &s;een, we &s;hall not feel our &s;elves obliged, or look upon our &s;elves to blame, when we do wrong. And if ever we
<PB N="3" REF="006963_0005_102AD300113D48C8">do blame our &s;elves at all, it will be only as we have gone contrary to &s;uch Obligations as we are <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> of. Altho' we may be to blame, in other Re&s;pects; yet we &s;hall not blame our &s;elves. If we be to blame, for in&s;tance, for go|ing contrary to the Honour and Authority of God; yet we &s;hall not be di&s;po&s;ed to blame our &s;elves on that Ac|count, unle&s;s we are &s;en&s;ible, how that the Honour and Authority of God did oblige us. If we are &s;orry for what we have done, at any Time, it will be only on &s;uch Ac|counts, on which, we &s;ee, we have done Wrong; and for &s;uch Rea&s;ons, for which, we &s;ee, we ought to have done otherwi&s;e.&mdash;Thus, if we &s;ee our great Obligations to all Ho|line&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, ari&s;ing from the Nature of God, and the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of his Government, Sin will, accord|ingly, appear as an infinite Evil. But if we &s;ee our &s;elves under no Obligations to God, but <HI>merely</HI> in Way of Grati|tude for the Kindne&s;&s;es we have received, we &s;hall feel to blame for our Sins, <HI>only</HI> as they are In&s;tances of Ingratitude. And in a Word, in what Re&s;pects &s;oever, we &s;ee our &s;elves obliged to do right, in tho&s;e Re&s;pects we &s;hall feel our&s;elves to blame when we do wrong; and that, in exact Proportion to the Weight, with which, a Sen&s;e of our Obligations lies on our Spirits.</P>
<P>Hence,</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of an <HI>Epicurean</HI> and Athei&s;tical Temper, who &s;ee them&s;elves under no Obligations to Virtue, but merely from pre&s;ent Self-Intere&s;t, as a virtuous Conduct tends to their pre&s;ent Ea&s;e, Profit &amp; Honour; if they neglect their Duty, and do wrong, they will blame them&s;elves, and be &s;orry, only becau&s;e they have hurt them&s;elves, and gone contrary to their own Intere&s;t for this World.&mdash;But if Per&s;ons have &s;ome belief of a future State, and of the Rewards and Pu|ni&s;hments of another Life; they may be &s;orry for their Sins, becau&s;e by them they have forfeited Heaven, and expo|&s;ed them&s;elves to Hell.&mdash;Or if they are under the Influence of a compa&s;&s;ionate Temper, or of natural Affection, and have injured a Neighbour, a Friend, or near Relative; Nature may prompt them, on that Account, to be &s;orry.&mdash;Or, if they
<PB N="4" REF="006963_0006_102AD3025BEF17B0">firmly believe, that God loves them, that Chri&s;t died for them, and that they are made Heirs of eternal Glory; and &s;ee, that by their Sins, they have been guilty of great Ingra|titude towards their almighty Benefactor; they may, merely, from natural Gratitude, be &s;orry on that Account.&mdash;But if the great Evil of Sin, as it is AGAINST A GOD OF INFINITE GLORY, be not &s;een; they will not mourn for Sin on that Account. And yet if that which con&s;titutes the great Evil of Sin, is not &s;een; and Sin is not hated and mourned for, upon the Account of that, which is it's chief and principal Malignity, our Repentance is not genuine. It is of Impor|tance therefore, that we know wherein the great Evil of Sin does really con&s;i&s;t.&mdash;For which Purpo&s;e, let us attend to the Words of our Text, which contains the Confe&s;&s;ion of a true Penitent, and exhibits the Sentiments of a contrite Heart. <HI>Again&s;t Thee, Thee only, have I &s;inned.</HI></P>
<P>Where <HI>ob&s;erve</HI> (1.) The particular Sins referred unto in the&s;e Words, viz. <HI>Murder</HI> and <HI>Adultery.</HI> For this <HI>P&s;alm</HI> was compo&s;ed after that <HI>Nathan</HI> the <HI>Prophet</HI> came to <HI>Da|vid,</HI> and reproved him, and denounced the Judgments of God again&s;t him for tho&s;e Sins. And in this <HI>P&s;alm</HI> he ex|pre&s;ly refers to the Sin of <HI>Murder,</HI> which he had been guilty of. v. 14. <HI>Deliver me from Blood-guiltine&s;s, O God!</HI> And 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed, he has Reference to his other Sin, in tho&s;e Words, v. 10. <HI>Create in me a</HI> CLEAN <HI>Heart, O God!</HI>&mdash;Now it is com|monly and ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that &s;ome Sins are immediately committed again&s;t GOD, &s;uch as, <HI>Bla&s;phemy, Idolatry</HI> &amp;c. while other Sins immediately re&s;pect our Neighbour, and are in|jurious to him, as was <HI>David</HI>'s <HI>Murder</HI> and <HI>Adultery.</HI>&mdash;And yet, it &s;eems, if we injure our Neighbour, God is &s;inned again&s;t, and we are to blame principally on that Account.&mdash;</P>
<P>For <HI>ob&s;erve</HI> (2.) The great Evil of <HI>David</HI>'s Sins, as &s;et forth in his Confe&s;&s;ion, and that which made them &s;o exceeding hainous, was, that they were <HI>committed again&s;t God.&mdash;Again&s;t Thee, Thee only</HI> (Thee chiefly and principally) <HI>have I &s;inned.</HI> He had injured <HI>Uriah,</HI> and done wrong on that Account: he had expo&s;ed him&s;elf to Reproach among his Subjects, and to Angui&s;h in his own Heart, and was to blame for
<PB N="5" REF="006963_0007_102AD303E4963218">bringing &s;o great a Calamity on him&s;elf.&mdash;But the Greatne&s;s of his Sin con&s;i&s;ted in its being <HI>again&s;t God.</HI> And this &s;eems to &s;wallow up all his Heart, and to overwhelm him with Sorrow. <HI>Again&s;t thee, thee only, have I &s;inned.</HI> And on this Account, his Sin appeared &s;o great to him, that he was ready to ju&s;tify God, in the dreadful Sentence which God denounced again&s;t him, by <HI>Nathan</HI> the <HI>Prophet:</HI> That his <HI>Wives &s;hould be defiled in the Sight of the Sun,</HI> the <HI>Sword never depart from his Hou&s;e,</HI> and that his <HI>Child &s;hould die.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xii.</NOTE> <HI>Thou art ju&s;t when thou &s;peakest, and clear when thou judgest.</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 51.4.</NOTE> God had &s;ent <HI>Nathan</HI> to charge home his Sin and Guilt up|on him, and to tell him, that by what he had done, he had <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed the Lord,</HI> and <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed the Commandment of the Lord,</HI> and given Occa&s;ion to the <HI>Enemies of God to bla&s;pheme</HI>
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xii. 9, 10, 14.</NOTE> &mdash; He had <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed the LORD,</HI> and <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed the Commandment of the LORD;</HI> for God had &s;aid, <HI>Thou &s;halt not Kill, Thou &s;halt not commit Adultery;</HI> for <HI>I am the LORD.</HI> But <HI>David</HI> had practically &s;aid,
<Q>I will commit Adultery with <HI>Bath&s;heba,</HI> and gratify my Lu&s;t, for all that God &s;ays: and I will murder her innocent Hu&s;band <HI>Uriah,</HI> that I may hide my Sin and Shame by this wicked Means, notwith&s;tanding the divine Prohibition. I don't care for God, nor his Law, or Authority, &s;o much, but that I will go thro' with my De&s;igns, and that, let come what will; for I value my Lu&s;t more than God, and my Reputation more than his Honour; and therefore neither God, nor his Law, Au|thority or Honour will I regard.</Q> This was the Lan|guage of <HI>David</HI>'s Conduct! And this is the Language of every Sin!&mdash;And thus he de&s;pi&s;ed the <HI>Commandment</HI> of God, and de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>God him&s;elf.</HI> And this was, with good Rea&s;on, charged home upon him, as the great Evil of his Sin; and for which God would &s;everely puni&s;h him. And in a Sen&s;e of this, with a broken Heart, he cries out, <HI>Again&s;t thee, thee only, have I &s;inned, and done this Evil in thy Sight: Where|fore thou art ju&s;t when thou &s;peake&s;t, and clear when thou judge&s;t.</HI>&mdash;And thus we &s;ee wherein the <HI>great Evil</HI> of <HI>David</HI>'s Sins did con&s;i&s;t, both in the Sight of God, and to his own

<P N="2">I. <HI>How, and in what Re&s;pects, Sin is again&s;t GOD.</HI></P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. Sin <HI>is contrary to the</HI> Nature <HI>of God.</HI>&mdash;A &s;inful Nature and a holy Nature are in direct Oppo&s;ition; they are a <HI>per|fect Contrariety</HI> to each other. <HI>The carnal Mind is Enmity against God.</HI>
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 7.</NOTE> And Sin is <HI>that abominable Thing which God's Soul abbors.</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. xliv. 4.</NOTE> The <HI>holy one of Irael</HI> is a Being of infinite Under&s;tanding, and of perfect Rectitude; and has a compleat and comprehen&s;ive View of all Things; and in all Ca&s;es &s;ees what is right &amp; &s;it &amp; beautiful to be done&mdash;how the DEITY &s;hould be loved and honoured in the World which he has made&mdash;and how his Creatures and Subjects &s;hould live to|gether in mutual Love and Benevolence, and not an unju&s;t or cruel Act be ever done thro' out all his Dominions. And as God &s;ees what is right and fit and beautiful, and what is contrary; &s;o he is accordingly affected towards Things. <HI>He loves Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and hates Iniquity.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xiv. 7.</NOTE> &mdash; Let God be e&s;teemed, reverenced, honoured and obeyed&mdash;Let Love and Good-will prevail and be e&s;tabli&s;hed among his Subjects&mdash; Let every Thing of a contrary Savour be eternally bani&s;h'd his Dominions; and God will be well plea&s;ed: But if any Di&s;honour is done to the DEITY, or Injury to our Fellow|Subjects, nothing can di&s;plea&s;e him more: for there is no|thing he hates like Sin: It is <HI>the abominable Thing which his Soul hates.</HI> Sin is more odious and dete&s;table to him, than the mo&s;t abominable Thing on Earth is to us. His Aver&s;ion to it is vehement beyond the Conception of any finite Mind.
<PB N="8" REF="006963_0010_102AD30BD3F64678">His Aver&s;ion to it is ab&s;olutely infinite.&mdash;In this Re&s;pect therefore Sin is again&s;t God. It is a going directly contrary to his Nature; and that in the mo&s;t tender Point; in a Thing which comes neare&s;t his Heart. Nothing is &s;o cro&s;s to him, nothing can di&s;oblige him &s;o much, or di&s;plea&s;e him, or grieve his Heart, like this.&mdash;As when a Man's Wife de|parts from him, and commits Whoredom with another Man, and breaks his Heart by her ill Carriage: So, &s;ays God, <HI>I am broken with their whori&s;h Heart.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. vi. 9. <HI>I am broken with their whori&s;h Heart.</HI> From the Cove|nant-Relation between God and his People <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> they are &s;aid to be <HI>married unto him,</HI> Jer. iii. 14. and hence, their going from God to Idols is called <HI>Whoredom.</HI> And to prefer an Idol before the true God was a very <HI>provoking</HI> thing: Therefore he &s;ays, <HI>I am broken with their who|ri&s;h Heart.</HI> But to prefer a vile Lu&s;t before God &s;eems to be in like Manner provoking: it is a Kind of &s;piritual Idolatry.

<P>No doubt, Almighty GOD has Right to govern the World: for originally He is ab&s;olute LORD of it; and by
<PB N="9" REF="006963_0011_102AD30D69C1B280">NATURE he is GOD MOST HIGH: and his GOD|HEAD and his LORDSHIP give him an undoubted Right of Government.

<P>No doubt, his Government is WORTHY to be univer|&s;ally &s;ubmitted unto: for it is all perfect and glorious. His Laws and his Di&s;pen&s;ations are perfect in Wi&s;dom, Recti|tude and Goodne&s;s: and even as He him&s;elf is infinitely worthy of all Love and Veneration, &s;o that his very Being affords infinite Ground of Joy among his Creatures; even &s;o his Government is ju&s;t like him&s;elf, and exhibits his very Image, and is WORTHY univer&s;ally to be rejoyced in.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. ii. 25.</NOTE> Yea, if by &s;ome Act of Sin we could do the greate&s;t Injury to the whole Creation; yet what is the whole Creation com|pared with GOD, the ALMIGHTY CREATOR? It is all but as <HI>a Du&s;t of the Ballance, or a Drop of the Bucket.</HI>

<P>Behold, now is a Day of Grace: and God is ready to be reconciled: a Door of Mercy is opened, by the Blood of the Son of GOD: Pardon and Peace are proclaimed to a rebellious, guilty World.&mdash;<HI>Repent, therefore, and be converted; that your Sins may be blotted out.</HI>&mdash;But if <HI>after your Hardne&s;s and impenitent Heart,</HI> you will venture to go on, <HI>trea&s;uring up Wrath against the Day of Wrath;</HI> you are like to know it, to your everla&s;ting Sorrow, that it is a fearful and horrible Thing, to <HI>&s;in again&s;t the LORD.</HI></P>
