<P>_IN all Societies and Commu|nities of Men whether Civil or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary (to prevent Confu&s;ion and Di&s;order, and that the End of their Combi|nation into &s;uch political Bo|dies &s;hould be an&s;wered) that there &s;hould be Rule and Go|vernment e&s;tabli&s;hed among them: And where there is &s;o, there mu&s;t be &s;uch as &s;ubmit and obey, as well as &s;uch as rule and Govern: And therefore our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great head
<PB N="2" REF="004145_0004_1003DCA78F9FD120">of the Church has directed to this in his Word, that &s;o all things may be done with Decency and Order: But then how widely different is <HI>This</HI> his Government from <HI>That,</HI> which now obtains, and hath long done &s;o, in the greate&s;t part of the Chri&s;tian Church, which hath long &s;ince gone off from that mixt Form which our Lord fir&s;t in&s;tituted, and is degenerated into a Mo|narchy: I &s;ay degenerated into it, for that however that kind of Government (when well tempered and re|gulated as is the happy Briti&s;h Monarchy) may &s;uit a State; it is evidently un&s;uitable to the Church of Chri&s;t; for hence have proceeded, That Popi&s;h Ty|ranny, That Error and Super&s;tition, That Pomp and Vanity which have &s;o painted and adulterated the Face of the Chri&s;tian Church, whereby &s;he hath lo&s;t That <HI>Native</HI> Comline&s;s put upon her by God <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ezek. 16.14.</NOTE> (with which &s;he &s;o charm'd the World in the Days of the Apo&s;tles) and chang'd it for the <HI>Factitious</HI> Beauty and Gaiety of an Harlot, and therefore is &s;o repre&s;ented, by the Holy Gho&s;t in the Revelation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. 17.5.</NOTE> as <HI>the Mother of Harlots, and Abominations of the Earth;</HI> Tho' that Form of Government then, which hath been &s;o pernicious to the Church of God, is to be rejected and refus'd, as what hath not proceeded from Chri&s;t, is no where found in the Scripture, and naturally tends to Idolatry and Su|per&s;tition; Yet we are by no means to lay a&s;ide Rule and Government, without which the Church of Chri&s;t, no more than any other Polity, can &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not here &s;pend Time in con&s;idering the &s;eve|ral Forms of Government which are at pre&s;ent exi&s;ting in the &s;everal parts of the Chri&s;tian Church, and to recommend this or the other, for that, we already have a very good Form of Government and Di&s;cipline, laid down in the Platform of our Churches, which tho' I can by no means think obligatory upon us as the Scrip|tures,
<PB N="3" REF="004145_0005_1003DCAC58F78A60">becau&s;e it wants Perfection, yet well de&s;erves to be highly honour'd and reverenc'd as a &s;trong Guard again&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion, which hath &s;o much defac'd the Church of Chri&s;t, and made it <HI>a Ne&s;t of every unclean Bird.</HI> I have therefore cho|&s;en to in&s;i&s;t upon the&s;e Words to Day, that I might &s;how if I can, what this Rule is, which is to be exercis'd in the Church of God, and what Obedience and Sub|mi&s;&s;ion is to be yielded thereto, That you Brethren of this Church of Chri&s;t may chearfully pay &s;uch a De|ference and Regard to that Rule which our Lord hath &s;et up in his Church, as that the Servant of God now to be &s;et over you in the Lord, may be able to render his Account of you to his Ma&s;ter, with Joy and not with Grief.</P>
<P><HI>Obey Them that have the Rule over you and &s;ubmit your&s;elves, for They watch for your Souls as They that mu&s;t give an Account: that They may do it with Joy and not with Grief: for this is unprofitable for you.</HI></P>
<P>The Jealou&s;ies and Su&s;picions of the Church of Chri&s;t, concerning the Rule and Government a&s;&s;umed over them, by their Guides, have ri&s;en to &s;uch a height, and I confe&s;s with regard to the Chri&s;tian Church in general they have had Rea&s;on eno' for it, tho' as to our&s;elves I think there is little need, becau&s;e our E&s;ta|bli&s;hment is in that re&s;pect low enough: But I &s;ay in con&s;ideration of the Rule and Power a&s;&s;um'd in the Chri&s;tian Church in general by their Governours, there has been &s;uch a Jealou&s;y, that having read the&s;e Words it will be nece&s;&s;ary to look into the Original, to con&s;ider the ju&s;t Import of the Terms u&s;ed in our Text, that we may more exactly know our Duty in this Regard, for that there are many Words in all Lan|guages that cannot (e&s;pecially if they be of various im|port) be truly rendered into any Other, by one par|ticular

It is true, as the Epi&s;coparians imagine the Bi&s;hop to be the only proper Pa&s;tor of his Church (which they call his whole Dioce&s;s) they think the Rulers here meant, are the Bi&s;hops of the Churches, in their Sen&s;e of that Office; tho' there are not wanting of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Whithy</HI> in Loc.</NOTE> them that allow that Mini&s;ters or ordinary Pa&s;tors of Churches are al&s;o here meant: But we who allow no &s;uch Bi&s;hop in the Church as they contend for, but declaring for an Equa|lity of all Pre&s;byters, to which Order we &s;uppo&s;e none, in the Church, &s;uperior, So <HI>we</HI> mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e Words are &s;poken of them, namely of &s;uch as are the Pa&s;tors of the &s;everal Churches; That this is the Order which the Apo&s;tle here hath regard to, when he &s;ays, <HI>Obey them that have the Rule over you:</HI> For, the&s;e

<P N="2">2. <HI>What is the Rule and Authority to be exercis'd by them, which the Flock is to Obey and Submit to.</HI> This Head then mu&s;t be well con&s;ider'd by us, for We mean not to plead for any of that Rule and Authority, which thro' the Apo&s;tacy of the Church of Chri&s;t from the Rules and Directions of the Go&s;pel, has &s;o long ago &s;ecretly and by Degrees crept into the Admini&s;trations of it, till at la&s;t it ro&s;e to &s;uch an enormous height, as to ca&s;t down the Thrones, Principalities and Powers of this World: And tho' by the Grace and Favour of God to the World it is much weakned, yet it &s;till retains a &s;trong u&s;urpation, not only over the Con|&s;ciences, but al&s;o over the temporal Concerns and In|tere&s;ts of Men.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Such have no Right to u&s;e Force and Compul&s;ion with their People in Spirituals.</HI> In what&s;oever Churches of Chri&s;t there is made u&s;e of External Force and Com|pul&s;ion in the&s;e Regards, &s;o far they are gone off from the Simplicity that is in Chri&s;t. If indeed by external Force and Compul&s;ion we cou'd per&s;wade Men to think other|wi&s;e than they do, doubtle&s;s the&s;e would be very proper Engines to promote Religion in the Hearts of Men. The external Affairs of Men in Civil Societies and Commu|nities are carried on by overt Acts, and therefore the Laws enacted in the&s;e Regards have re&s;pect to tho&s;e Methods whereby they may be controul'd in their ex|ternal Actions: And in the&s;e Re&s;pects therefore cor|poral Puni&s;hments and Sanctions, which have their Influence upon their Bodies, are found by Experience to be very proper, becau&s;e often effectual, but ina&s;much as Religion, which it is the profe&s;s'd De&s;ign of Mini&s;ters
<PB N="8" REF="004145_0010_1003DCDB79DD7618">of the Go&s;pel to promote and encourage among Men, hath its Foundation in, and depends upon, the Operati|ons of the Soul and Mind, &s;o external Force hath nothing to do with it; hereby indeed Men may be forc'd to &s;peak and act, according to the Influence of &s;uch exter|nal Puni&s;hments, but if they &s;till think otherwi&s;e it only makes Hypocrites of them, and then in&s;tead of promoting Religion we have only forc'd them to act again&s;t their Con&s;ciences, which is the greate&s;t Contra|diction to the Advancement of the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, and therefore the Mini&s;ters or Pa&s;tors of his Churches &s;hould have no Hand in making any Laws with Re|gard to the Spiritual Affairs of their People, by which to bind their Con&s;ciences in Matters of Religion: Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath already given us the&s;e his Laws in his Go&s;pel, which are all of them of a Spiritual Nature, and therefore no Man what&s;oever, nor any Number or Body of Men, have or can have any Right to make Laws for the Regulation of the Spiri|tual Concerns of Men in the World. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See Bp <HI>Hoadley</HI>'s Sermon on <HI>John</HI> 18.36.

<P>"A Divine Precept is nece&s;&s;ary to warrant every part of Reli|gious Wor&s;hip. In&s;tituted Wor&s;hip mu&s;t be able to prove its Legitimacy by In&s;titution, for becau&s;e it is not <HI>natural</HI> but <HI>po&s;itive,</HI> it depends upon Authority; its Obligation therefore can be of no greater Strength, than the Authority of its Author can put upon it; and that mu&s;t be founded in his Right to Command it. All In&s;tructions derive their Authority either from God or the Creature: If it be from God, then He hath &s;ignified his Mind about it in Scripture, and that in particular; for He hath no where by any ge|neral Indulgence given away this Liberty of His to any other Authority in the World, to have the Dominion of the Con&s;ciences of Men, or to give Rules of Wor&s;hip, but hath &s;trongly prohibited it, and &s;everely threatned any that &s;hall pre&s;ume to do it.</P>

And this is evident becau&s;e Chri&s;t's Kingdom in this World is a
<PB N="9" REF="004145_0011_1003DCDD692B5A38">Spiritual Kingdom, and &s;uch Laws pretend to regulate the Hearts and Affections of Men, and Our Lord hath in this Affair con&s;tituted no [humane] Authority, to make any Addition to his Laws, which are full and compleat, as He hath deliver'd them unto us. <HI>He</HI> that knew the Heart, <HI>knew all that was in Man,</HI> and therefore was able to give him a compleat Law. As to Men indeed, thro' the imperfection of their Wi&s;dom, and their Ignorance of the humane Nature, and how the Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions of Men will vary the Nece&s;&s;i|ties of Things, they are often forced to make <HI>an Act in Addition to an Act,</HI> but it is not &s;o with our great Lawgiver, but as his Laws are all the Re&s;ult of in|finite Wi&s;dom, &s;o there is no need to add to them or dimini&s;h from them.</P>
<P>Indeed as to the&s;e Laws and Rules, proper to regu|late Churches, con&s;ider'd as Civil Societies, whereby the Prudentials of their temporal Concerns, are to be conducted and concluded, here the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, together with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Con&s;ent of their People and Flock, may doubtle&s;s make &s;uch Rules and Orders as be&s;t &s;uit them in the&s;e Con&s;ide|rations: But as to all tho&s;e Laws that have any Re|ference to the Soul and Con&s;cience, to Men in Spirituals, they are to be look'd for in the Go&s;pel. And there|fore al&s;o we are to look there for the Sanctions of His Laws, and tho&s;e Rewards and Puni&s;hments, whereby He de&s;igns to promote His Kingdom in the Hearts of Men, and the&s;e are, the Promi&s;es <HI>of Joy un&s;peakable and full of Glory,</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of God, upon our Obedience, and the Threatnings of <HI>Eternal Mi&s;ery and Sorrow</HI> upon our Di&s;obedience, in a Word, the Lo&s;s of the Favour of God, and &s;uffering his Wrath and Indignation; the&s;e are the only Sanctions which our Lord has given to his Laws, and the&s;e may not be alter'd by Men, may not be added to, neither by People nor by Mini&s;ters
<PB N="10" REF="004145_0012_1003DCE7DEF59D08">and tho&s;e that have the highe&s;t Authority in his Church. And therefore, as I &s;aid before, temporal Rewards and Puni&s;hments have nothing to do in Religion, becau&s;e they are &s;uch as the great Head of the Church hath not propos'd we &s;hould be influenc'd by, for that they have no tendency to per&s;wade the Mind: It is the Heart which God looks at in all Religious Actions, that if we wor&s;hip him it &s;hould be in Sincerity and Truth, but there is nothing of this tendency either in the Rewards of this World, or in external Force. Pri|&s;ons, Racks and Tortures, have no tendency to convince the Con&s;cience. Worldly Glories and Rewards are far from tending to rai&s;e the Heart and Affections to heavenly Things, which is the <HI>Peculiar</HI> in true Religi|on. But if we con&s;ider the terrors of the Wrath of God threatned to Sinners, and the exceeding Weight of Glory promis'd to the Servants of Chri&s;t, here we have the &s;tronge&s;t Topics of Per&s;ua&s;ion, and &s;uch as are in|finitely more weighty, than all the Arguments we can form from any worldly Con&s;iderations; and which is beyond all, &s;uch as we have hope, the Spirit of God will co-operate with, upon the Minds and Con&s;ciences of Men.</P>
<P>But as this external Force and Compul&s;ion which has been &s;o much us'd in the Chri&s;tian Church, has origi|nated from a Spirit of Bigotry and a Servile Regard to the fal&s;e glo&s;&s;es and mi&s;interpretation of the Laws of the Go&s;pel, by &s;uch as have a&s;&s;um'd a Tyrannical Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority, Therefore I &s;ay further, that the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel have no Right to impo&s;e their Interpretations of the Laws of Chri&s;t upon their Flocks: Every Man is oblig'd to receive the Laws of Chri&s;t, and to yield Obedience to them in that Sen&s;e in which he under&s;tands them, and when we oblige them to yield Obedience to tho&s;e Laws, in the differ|ent Sen&s;e in which we under&s;tand them, it is in Fact making another Law for them; every Man therefore
<PB N="11" REF="004145_0013_1003B9509231A760">is to judge for him&s;elf in the&s;e Things, and to have no Impo&s;ition made upon his Con&s;cience in Spirituals, for this is to u&s;urp that Dominion which our Lord hath re&s;erv'd to him&s;elf. It is true, it is much of the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, as they are Teachers, to in&s;truct their Flocks in the Mind of Chri&s;t, as they them&s;elves under&s;tand it, (which part of their Office I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;peak of) but this is quite another Thing from impo&s;ing their Sen&s;e of Matters upon them, and pretending they break the Law of Chri&s;t if they do not think in the&s;e Regards as they do: For as every Man is to an&s;wer for him&s;elf, as to the Regard he hath had to the Laws of Chri&s;t, &s;o he cannot be guiltle&s;s, tho' he act agreable to the Sentiments of the greate&s;t Men upon Earth, if thereby he contradicts his own Light, Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience in that Affair. This &s;hall &s;uffice for the Negative Con&s;ideration of that Rule and Authority which is to be exercis'd by the Pa&s;tors of the Churches of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I proceed to the po&s;itive Con&s;ideration of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To &s;hew what that Rule and Authority is, which the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel have committed to them, to which this Obedience and Submi&s;&s;ion of their Flocks is re|quired.</HI> And here,

1. <HI>The Pa&s;tor is to be con&s;ider'd as the Teacher and In&s;tructor of his Flock, and all that Submi&s;&s;ion and Obe|dience render'd to him, that is proper in that Quality.</HI> I &s;hall not &s;pend Time here to prove that this is his Duty, becau&s;e it will be readily acknowledged, to be a principal Part of his Work, that is to take up a great Part of his Time and Talents among them: To teach them the Principles of Religion, to warn them of the various Errors in Doctrine which they are to be aware of, and to feed them with Spiritual Knowledge, of which al&s;o I &s;hall &s;ay more hereafter: It is evident then that he that teaches and in&s;tructs, mu&s;t in that Regard (tho' in others inferior) have a priority to him that is taught and in&s;tructed. I am aware that Teach|ing is us'd in Contradi&s;tinction to Rule and Govern|ment, but yet it is neverthele&s;s certain, that the Right to teach and in&s;truct implies an Obligation upon the Di&s;ciple to receive and obey the In&s;truction, and I rather &s;ay this becau&s;e the Word in our Text tran&s;lated, <HI>RULE over you,</HI> may be (as I have &s;aid) otherwi&s;e render'd, them that <HI>Guide</HI> you, that is that Guide you in the way of the Chri&s;tian Life, that is (no doubt) by Teaching and In&s;truction: Such then as Teach, Lead and Guide, mu&s;t have &s;ome Rule over tho&s;e that are taught, led and guided by them. The Sub|mi&s;&s;ion which is paid to any as a Teacher, certainly cannot be le&s;s than to receive his Doctrine, in &s;uch manner as to think our &s;elves obliged to behave our &s;elves agreable to the Information, we &s;o receive from him; that is, as we con&s;ider him, giving his In&s;tructi|ons, agreable to that Rule of Faith and Manners, which we enjoy from God: For by no means are we to regard him, however great his Name is and what|&s;oever Veneration we have for him, yet are we by no means to regard any of his In&s;tructions, farther than they are agreable to the Word of God: If any of the
<PB N="13" REF="004145_0015_1003DD08B95811A8">corrupt Parts of the Chri&s;tian Church, think they have any other Rule of Faith be&s;ides the Scriptures, yet to us who are of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Communion,</HI> the Scripture is confe&s;&s;edly our only Rule in the&s;e Things, and there|fore you are to regard nothing, re&s;pecting either Faith or Manners, which your Pa&s;tors teach you, if it at all digre&s;s from that unerring Rule.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Pa&s;tors of the Churches of Chri&s;t are to be con|&s;ider'd as having Authority to rebuke and reprove, and &s;o is Obedience and Submi&s;&s;ion to be yielded to them.</HI> If then they have Authority to teach and in&s;truct, in what way they are to walk, certainly when they err from that way, they are to re&s;train them, to be check upon them, and rebuke them for their Wandrings; and the Apo&s;tle directs <HI>Titus,</HI> 1 <HI>Ch.</HI> 13. <HI>to rebuke them and that &s;harply if need be, that they might be &s;ound in the Faith.</HI> This Work of the Pa&s;tor then implies Rule and Authority, for as we bring you no Le&s;&s;ons or In|&s;tructions, or at lea&s;t ought not to bring you any other, than what we receive from the Word of God, &s;o have we the &s;ame Word as the Foundation of our Re|proofs and Remon&s;trances again&s;t any of your Actions, as they are oppo&s;ite or contradictory to that great Rule: Therefore when we rebuke and reprove, we a&s;k not your Regard, your Obedience and Submi&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s we prove by that Word, that you have done as ye ought not to have done; but when we do this, we demand your Attention, you are to reverence &s;uch Reproofs as what the Word of God hath commanded, and authoriz'd us to lay before you: If you &s;ay, that this is an Obedience and Submi&s;&s;ion to the Word of God, but not to your Pa&s;tors, Be it &s;o, We a&s;k no more than that Regard which will nece&s;&s;arily accom|pany the Doctrines and In&s;tructions, Reproofs and Remon&s;trances of the Go&s;pel, con&s;cientiou&s;ly receiv'd by you. Ju&s;t as the Ca&s;e is in the Civil Government,
<PB N="14" REF="004145_0016_1003DD111C123BC8">we are to obey &s;uch as have magi&s;tratical Rule and Power over us, but how do we render Obedience to them, and what is it?

<P N="4">4. <HI>The Pa&s;tor of the Church is to be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t Officer in the Church, by whom the judicial Sentence

<P>Upon the&s;e Things laid together, we may &s;ee, what kind of Rule and Government, the Pa&s;tor is to exerci&s;e over his Flock, and what Submi&s;&s;ion is to be render'd unto him. He hath no Right to u&s;e any external Force, if it were in his Power, nor is he by any Influ|ence he may have, ever to endeavour to move the Civil Magi&s;trate to do it: He is by no means to influence or govern his Church, in their Spirituals, by any other Laws than Chri&s;t has laid down in his Go&s;pel, who&s;e Force wholly depends upon Spiritual Sanctions, or Pu|ni&s;hments and Rewards that are properly Spiritual: He hath no Right to impo&s;e his Interpretations of the Go&s;pel, upon his Flock, but when he hath inlightned them by his Teaching and In&s;truction as much as is in his Power, they mu&s;t &s;till be left to judge for them|&s;elves, and to act according to their own Con&s;ciences, &s;o that all coercive Power is to be di&s;claim'd by the Pa&s;tors of the Churches of Chri&s;t: All the Force they are to u&s;e lies in rational Arguments, convincing the Minds of their Flock &s;trongly, and inlightning them with Knowledge, whereby they may plainly &s;ee the Way, that they wander not from the Path of Life through any Darkne&s;s of Error and Super&s;tition. But if they do wander, that they re&s;train, by rebuking and reproving them, and that &s;harply if need be. Thus

<P N="1">1. <HI>They are to guard their Flocks.</HI> This is what mu&s;t be fir&s;t intended, by that Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>They watch for your Souls.</HI> It intimates, that the Soul is in conti|nual Danger by &s;ome Enemy that de&s;igns its Ruin and De&s;truction; and alas, how unhappy our State and Condition in the World in this Regard! while the Souls of Men are in perpetual Hazzard in this State of War, and how unequal is the Strife, from the Number, the Subtilty and the Strength of the Adver&s;ary! Our Lord therefore hath given his Pa&s;tors to his Flocks, that they &s;hould watch and guard them from all their &s;piritual Enemies; and as the Manner in which the Enemy endeavours to intrap his Prey is various, &s;o are they to improve their whole Skill and all their Powers: Some times they are in danger by the ri&s;e of Here&s;y, and the growth of Infidelity; the&s;e then are to be carefully heeded in their fir&s;t Ri&s;e, and the vain &s;uper|ficial pretender to Knowledge that vents his Errors, to be timely, carefully and prudently oppo&s;ed, while the Truth and Excellency and divine Origin of the Scrip|tures is rationally evidenc'd to his Flock: But above all, is he to oppo&s;e the greate&s;t of all Here&s;ies, Immo|rality of Life and Manners, from whence mo&s;t other Here&s;ies proceed; for Men would never be tempted to &s;eek after other Schemes of Religion, and Princi|ples of Chri&s;tianity, than are plainly delivered to them in the Scriptures, were they not aware, that according to the pre&s;ent Sy&s;tem and Doctrines they were not &s;afe: But when they have fir&s;t immers'd them&s;elves in Vice and led an abandon'd Life, and thence &s;ee them|&s;elves liable to Mi&s;ery and Ruin, they are tempted to form a Set of Principles agreable to their own Morals,
<PB N="19" REF="004145_0021_1003B974DFE2B458">that they may get rid of the Fear and Di&s;tre&s;s, that mu&s;t incumber their Souls, while they believe the Sanc|tions of the Word of God.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;tor of the Church of Chri&s;t therefore is to oppo&s;e Vice and Immorality with all his Force and Powers, and while he is exhorting them to Soundne&s;s of Doctrine, and to perform tho&s;e Offices of Religion that relate to the Divine Wor&s;hip, to attend the exter|nal Ordinances, that he omit not the weightier Mat|ters of the Law, that they behave them&s;elves with all purity of Manners, in all Temperance and Cha&s;tity with re&s;pect to them&s;elves, with all that Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s to others, that Uprightne&s;s and Sincerity in all their Dealings with Men, the want of which is the Di&s;grace and will be the Condemnation of many a zealous external Profe&s;&s;or of Religion: The Pa&s;tors therefore are thus to guard their Flocks, to watch and be diligent in the&s;e Re&s;pects, that they may prevent the &s;preading of Error, and the increa&s;e of every kind of Vice and Immorality.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Pa&s;tors of the Churches of Chri&s;t, as a part of their Watch, are to pray for their Flocks.</HI> After all that we can do, we have no Power to effect any Thing as of our&s;elves; we may argue and remon&s;trate, and u&s;e our be&s;t Endeavours with our Flocks, but we can bring nothing to Effect, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the great Shepherd; when then we have done all we are able in the&s;e Regards, we are to carry our Flocks to Chri&s;t in Prayer, and there implore his Ble&s;&s;ing upon our Endeavours with them, that He would guard and defend them, that He would pardon and forgive them, that He would give them His Divine Grace to help in Time of Need. Our Powers of Rea&s;oning and con|vincing the Minds of Men may be very great and con&s;iderable; and we may be able to &s;top the Mouths
<PB N="20" REF="004145_0022_1003DD4E064FCC88">of Gain&s;ayers, but yet it is not in our Power to turn them from Darkne&s;s unto Light; but for the convert|ing Grace of God, we are to pour out our Soul to him in Prayer, not only with our Flocks in Public, but our Souls &s;hould weep in &s;ecret Places for their Sins, and be importunate for the Divine Grace, on them and on their Children.

<ITEM>2. By their Life and Manners.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They are teach and in&s;truct their People by Word and Doctrine.</HI> As they take their Texts and Topics of Di&s;cour&s;e from the holy Scriptures, &s;o (as we have already &s;aid) they are to be careful to teach and in|&s;truct their People according to them, and to deliver nothing to them as obligatory upon them, but what is found in tho&s;e Scriptures, either in expre&s;s Terms, or rationally deducible therefrom: To choo&s;e &s;uch Heads of Di&s;cour&s;e al&s;o, as are be&s;t &s;uited to the Ne|ce&s;&s;ities of their People, that they may feed them with Food convenient for them, giving them the Bread which came down from Heaven, that they may be nouri&s;hed to everla&s;ting Life; that they mo&s;t of all therefore, in&s;i&s;t upon tho&s;e Doctrines, that tend to pro|more a Life of Faith, that tend to convince them of their own Weakne&s;s and Impotence, and their ab&s;o|lute Need of a Saviour, that they may be fill'd with
<PB N="21" REF="004145_0023_1003DD5B26000AE8">Love to God, as <HI>the Light of the Glories of the Divine Nature is manife&s;ted in the Face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and exhibited in the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel. With the&s;e Doctrines is the Preacher to warm the Hearts of his Hearers; they &s;hould therefore be deliver'd with Ear|ne&s;tne&s;s and Affection, that while he feels the Energy of them in his own Heart, and &s;uch his divine Mu|&s;ings have kindled a Flame in his own Soul, He may be happily in&s;trumental of communicating the &s;ame divine Fervours to others, that their Hearts may al&s;o glow and <HI>burn within them, while beginning at Mo&s;es and all the Prophets, he expounds to them in all the Scriptures, the Things concerning</HI> Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Pa&s;tors of the Churches of Chri&s;t are to in&s;truct their Flocks <HI>by their Lives and Manners.</HI> It is an old Ob&s;ervation, that Examples teach more &s;trong|ly than Precepts; and therefore the Life of the Pa&s;tor &s;hould exemplify all the Practical Doctrines which he delivers to his People. All the Directions and Warn|ings of the Shepherd will never be able to keep his Flock in the Way, if He him&s;elf leave the Path. If they are apt to wander from the Path, tho' He him&s;elf keep right on his Way, how much more will they do &s;o, when He &s;ets them the Example? It is therefore ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that we &s;hould be Examples to our Flocks, of all the Moral Duties which we preach unto them; in Temperance, in Humility, in Devotion, in Patience, in Love and Charity: that as far as is po&s;&s;ible they may &s;ee the Excellency of the Chri&s;tian Doctrines exemplified in our Behaviour, that <HI>&s;eeing our good Conver&s;ation, they may glorify our heavenly Father.</HI> And thus are the Pa&s;tors to watch for the Souls of their Flocks.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>The&s;e Souls they mu&s;t give an Account of unto Chri&s;t.</HI> Hence it is that God tells the Prophet, when

How many Souls, alas, will peri&s;h, notwith|&s;tanding all the Labour and Care of their faithful Pa&s;|tors! But of all the&s;e they will be forc'd to give up their Accounts with Grief and Sorrow, the&s;e being &s;uch as are &s;poken of in the Prophet, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.9. <HI>If thou

<P N="3">3. <HI>If you &s;ubmit not your &s;elves to the&s;e In&s;tructions and Warnings of God, which He &s;ends to you by us, we mu&s;t give up our Accounts with Grief and Sorrow.</HI> Tho' the faithful Pa&s;tor of his Flock will have great Con&s;olation, when he is able to &s;ay, according to that in the Prophet, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 49.4. <HI>Tho' I have labour'd in vain, and &s;pent my Strength for nought and in vain, yet &s;urely my Judgment is with the Lord, and my Work with my God:</HI> Yet when their People regard not their Warnings and In&s;tructions and Reproofs, with what Sighs, Tears, Sorrow and heavine&s;s of Heart mu&s;t they be di&s;tre&s;s'd, to &s;ee the Souls of their People lo&s;t!

<P N="1">I. <HI>Hence we learn the Dignity of the Mini&s;terial Of|fice.</HI> The Dignity of any Office certainly re&s;ults from the End and De&s;ign of that Office. It is certain then, that there is no Office and Imployment, can have a greater and better De&s;ign than this, namely, to pro|mote the Honour and Glory of God, and the Good of his rea&s;onable Creatures here in this World, and their eternal Happine&s;s in the World to come: This is the &s;ole Bu&s;ine&s;s and proper End of the In&s;titution of this Office in the World: And hence it is evident, that the End and De&s;ign of it, is &s;uperior to that of any Station and Office what&s;oever, that relates to this World only. The highe&s;t Office of the Civil State, that of the &s;upream Magi&s;trate, hath Relation only to the pre&s;ent World, to promote the Convenience and Happine&s;s of Men, while they live here in Communi|ties and Societies together; but the De&s;ign and Intent of this Office, is both to promote the Peace and Hap|pine&s;s of Men while in this World (both influencing to all <HI>per&s;onal Vertues,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;ting and &s;trengthening the Magi&s;tratical Rule and Power in promoting all that Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and other <HI>&s;ocial Vertues,</HI> which it is his particular Province and Intere&s;t to &s;up|port among his Subjects) and al&s;o to per&s;wade Men to &s;ecure their everla&s;ting Happine&s;s, that when all So|cieties here &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved, they may be happy Subjects of the Kingdom of Glory, for ever and ever, I &s;ay, the End and De&s;ign of our Office is thus great and &s;uperior; but what then, do we therefore claim the Honours of the World, &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the Civil Magi&s;trate? No, by no means; we leave the&s;e to Antichri&s;t, who hath exalted him&s;elf, not only above all the civil Powers of the World, but above all that is called God; No, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath decla|red,

<P N="2">II. From what we have heard, learn <HI>the Difficulty of the Mini&s;terial Office.</HI> The Enemies they have to op|po&s;e are many and &s;trong, their Wiles and Tempta|tions numerous and &s;ubtil, and therefore our Work mu&s;t be laborious, diligent and perpetual, and what

The Work is laborious and hard, to devi&s;e and &s;elect tho&s;e &s;everal Heads of Argument, and Means of Per&s;wa&s;ion that &s;hall be&s;t convince the Mind, and &s;uit our People, in their &s;everal Circum&s;tances; and &s;ome times this or the other particular Per&s;on, that is wander'd from the Path of Life; and to apply them in that peculiar hortatory Manner as &s;hall be&s;t win upon their Affections and Pa&s;&s;ions.

<P>However honourable the Office may be, yet the Officer can never be &s;o, without doing the Duty of his Office: If we would have the E&s;teem of our People, we mu&s;t &s;tudy to de&s;erve it, by a con&s;cientious Execu|tion of the great Charge which we receive, when we are inve&s;ted with this Mini&s;try.</P>

<P>Much le&s;s is the Preacher to think it &s;trange if he is di&s;pis'd, when his Example contradicts his Doctrine. It will indeed be very ridiculous for us to demand the Veneration of our People, if we thus bring Infamy and Di&s;grace upon our&s;elves. We mu&s;t therefore al|ways guard our moral Character, with utmo&s;t Care and Diligence, for we are &s;et up to View in the fair|e&s;t Light, whereby every Spot will be ea&s;ily di&s;cerned, and it is well if the Adver&s;ary be not &s;ometimes &s;o

What a Je&s;t is it for us to preach the Doctrines of Meekne&s;s and Humility, when we are thir&s;ting after Power and Grandeur, either in the Church or State? Or when we preach again&s;t Covetou&s;ne&s;s and Love of the World, can they ever believe us in earne&s;t, while they &s;ee us in&s;atiable in our De&s;ires of worldly Riches, endeavouring to <HI>lay tho&s;e Burthens of</HI> Self-denial <HI>upon other Mens Shoulders, which we are loth to touch with one of our Fingers?</HI> Or how &s;hall we ever per|&s;wade them that we believe it the Chri&s;tian's Duty to relieve the helple&s;s and mi&s;erable, when we our&s;elves &s;hall like the Prie&s;t in the Parable, turn a&s;ide from &s;uch as are in Want and Di&s;tre&s;s?

<P><PB N="31" REF="004145_0033_1003DDC015E27E48">
We have in&s;i&s;ted upon the Dignity of the Office you are now to be inve&s;ted with, and have in the Name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, claim'd from his Churches, Obedience, Submi&s;&s;ion and Reverence to their Pa&s;tors; that they &s;hould treat them as the Me&s;&s;engers of God, as &s;uch as bring them the good Tidings of eternal Sal|vation, and are &s;ollicitous that they may be &s;aved: And the&s;e reverent Regards for their Pa&s;tor, do we now demand from this Church of Chri&s;t: But do we there|fore mean that you &s;hould exact and demand Reverence of them? By no means: It is true, it is theirs to give this Reverence, and to act this Obedience and Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to their Pa&s;tor; but in Prudence, not yours to demand it, in any other Way, than by your Actions an&s;wering all the Duties of the Pa&s;toral Care and Watch.</P>
<P>Indeed in Di&s;cour&s;es of this more public kind, when we con&s;ider the Duties of Mini&s;ter and People, with re&s;pect to one another, becau&s;e our Lord has directed them how they &s;hall behave toward their Pa&s;tor, it is doubtle&s;s a Duty to &s;how what this Obligation is: But in the particular Intercour&s;es between a Pa&s;tor and his own Church, it will certainly be his Wi&s;dom, to force their Reverence and E&s;teem, rather by that Meekne&s;s and Lowline&s;s, that Love, and Concern for their Wel|fare in Chri&s;t, which the Go&s;pel hath made his Duty. Our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord that knew what was in Man, and under&s;tands the humane Nature, better than all Men, hath therefore directed to this; and particularly guards his Di&s;ciples again&s;t their a&s;piring after Rule and Do|minion, and therefore when he found them doing &s;o, immediately remon&s;trates again&s;t it, telling them, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mar. 10.44.</NOTE> <HI>It &s;hall not be &s;o among you; but who&s;oever will be great among you, &s;hall be your Mini&s;ter, and who&s;oever will

And as he applies it and &s;ays upon it, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 13.13.</NOTE> <HI>The Servant is not greater than his Lord, nor be that is &s;ent greater than He that &s;ent him.</HI> Follow then the Example of your Lord, by being ready to &s;hew your Love and Regard to them, by doing any Labour of Love, how&s;oever you therein conde&s;cend unto them: For we are often to give up our Right to the external Tokens of Re&s;pect, and Evidences of Submi&s;&s;ion, that may yet be expre&s;sly claim'd by tho&s;e that bear &s;ecular Offices; and certainly we may well do &s;o, when we rule in the Hearts and Affections of our People, which He &s;hall be always mo&s;t likely to do, <HI>Caeteris paribus</HI> that &s;hews the &s;malle&s;t Regards to the external Marks of Rule and Dominion.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;hall obtain a real Rule and Authority, while cautious of vindicating your Right to the Shew and Appearance of it: In which I imagine lies the Secret of gaining that E&s;teem and Regard, for the ob|taining of which, the indu&s;trious Claims and Demands of Men, will for ever be in vain.</P>
<P>And when by this Meekne&s;s of Behaviour, you have a Room in the Hearts and Affections of your People, it will very much facilitate the great Difficulties that lie before you. You have heard how great your Dif|ficulties are, how hard your Labour, how con&s;tant and
<PB N="33" REF="004145_0035_1003DDD426ED2620">perpetual, be not then hereby di&s;couraged in your Work, for your Ma&s;ter is with you, and his Grace is &s;ufficient for you, while you &s;incerely endeavour to do the Duties of the Mini&s;try, you &s;hall now receive of the Lord.</P>
<P>Let then the Doctrines with which you in&s;truct this People, be tho&s;e of the Go&s;pel, teach them the pecu|liar duties of Chri&s;tianity, that &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h them, as the Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, in that Love and Charity which our Lord hath made the proper Chri&s;ti|an Characteri&s;tic: But forget not to lay tho&s;e moral Duties which our Lord hath equally demanded of us, in the Foundation of this &s;piritual Building, which, tho' a part of the Work, commonly lea&s;t ornamental, yet ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Support of the whole.</P>
<P>And in this part of your Work, take care, in the admini&s;tration of your Reproofs that it be always with Courage, but with much Wi&s;dom and Caution, ever remon&s;trating again&s;t Vice who&s;oever is guilty, but take care that you give no Occa&s;ion for any jealou&s;y, that &s;uch your Remon&s;trances are the Effect of any particular Pieque and Re&s;entment; for your per&s;onal Reproofs are to be given in private, and will always require a wife Con&s;ideration of the Tempers and Di&s;|po&s;itions of Men; watching al&s;o for that peculiar Situation of Mind, in which the Reproof will be mo&s;t likely to take with them, for the <HI>mollia tempora fandi</HI> mu&s;t never be neglected by a wife Reprover.</P>
<P>But of how little Advantage will all this wife Care and Caution in the &s;everal Duties of your Office be, without Prayer? It is then ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that you be a Man of Prayer: That you pray for the Di|vine A&s;&s;i&s;tance in all your Studies, in the compo&s;ition of all your Sermons, and in the admini&s;tration of all
<PB N="34" REF="004145_0036_1003B9EAE350D908">your Reproofs to every Offender. That you always bear this your Flock upon your Heart, before God in Prayer, that he would make you in&s;trumental of turning them from Darkne&s;s unto Light.</P>
<P>And to per&s;wade you to be thus watchful for the Souls of your People, I cannot u&s;e a &s;tronger Argu|ment, than that in our Text, viz. <HI>That you mu&s;t give up an Account of them to God.</HI> Remember then every Soul is dear to God, They are &s;o dear to Chri&s;t, that He hath &s;hed his Blood for them, and is it po&s;&s;ible that He &s;hould not demand how you have cared for them? This indeed is a Con&s;ideration that is eno' to make us all tremble, le&s;t any of tho&s;e Souls which our Lord hath committed to our Care, &s;hould peri&s;h thro' our Neglect.

When therefore &s;uch an one comes to you in the Name of Chri&s;t, as his Amba&s;&s;ador, as this Servant of God doth this Day, if you honour his Ma&s;ter, you will reverence him, and otherwi&s;e, as our Lord hath told us, He will re&s;ent the evil Treatment, as tho' it were offer'd to him&s;elf, forecited <HI>Luk.</HI> 10.16. <HI>He that de&s;pi&s;eth you, de&s;pi&s;eth Me, and be that de&s;pi&s;eth Me, de&s;pi&s;eth him that &s;ent Me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Love your Pa&s;tor.</HI> As Love is the fulfilling of the Law, that is, he that hath that true Love which the Go&s;pel requireth, will do all the other Duties that are incumbent upon him: So it is in this Ca&s;e; Love to your Pa&s;tor, will comprehend all the Regards we expect from you. The Pa&s;tors of the Churches therefore can de&s;ire nothing more than the Love of their Flocks. For if you &s;hall love your Pa&s;tor, you will be delighted with him; This will make you to &s;upport him with

Again, if you love him, you will attend his Teaching and In&s;truction; you will al&s;o be more ready to receive his In&s;tructions into your Hearts; you will more kindly receive his Reproofs, for a Reproof is never receiv'd &s;o well, as from one whom we love; &s;o that I was going to &s;ay, that he that is not beloved by the Of|fender, &s;hould never offer to reprove him, or at lea&s;t he does it with very little pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Pray for your Pa&s;tor.</HI> It is true this Duty is included in Love, for as we always de&s;ire the happine&s;s of them we Love, &s;o we give a good Evidence of &s;uch De&s;ires, when in the Sincerity of our Hearts we recommend them to the Divine Care and Ble&s;&s;ing: But in as much as Prayer for him will tend to the increa&s;e of your Love to him, and the confirmation of tho&s;e amiable Qualities, that &s;hall continually attract your De&s;ire and E&s;teem, therefore I in&s;i&s;t upon it as a di&s;tinct Head, That you ever remember him in your Applications to the Throne of Grace, wi&s;ely con&s;ider|ing, that when you pray for him, you pray for your &s;elves and for your Children.

<HEAD>The CHARGE.</HEAD>
<P>THUS, <HI>Syr,</HI> we the Mini&s;ters of the Lord Je&s;us, and in His Name, do, by the &s;acred Rites of <HI>Fa&s;ting and Prayer, and laying on of the Hands of the Pre&s;bytery,</HI> &s;olemnly ordain you unto the Work of the evangelical Mini&s;try, in the Church of the living GOD; and &s;eperate you unto the Office of a Pa&s;tor of this particular Church of the Lord, with whom we are now a&s;&s;embled: and thus publickly, and regularly intro|duce you into the &s;acred Mini&s;try, and hand down unto you that Commi&s;&s;ion, which our Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter gave unto His Apo&s;tles, and, in them, unto all his Mini&s;ters, to the End of the World; with full Power to act the Part of a Go&s;pel-Bi&s;hop, in this holy Church of the Lord Je&s;us: and we do accordingly thus open|ly, and heartily, embrace you, our Reverend, and Be|loved, Brother, in our tender Affection, and E&s;teem of you, as one, and equal, with us, in the Fellow&s;hip of the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And now, tho', we claim no manner of Authority over you yet, as Elder in Years, and more Experi|enced in the Duties, and Burdens, of your Office, Suffer us, our dear Brother, to lay the Admonitions, and Charges, of God, before you; which we cannot better do than in the Words of the great Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, who, when he had &s;ent for the Elders of the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> &s;aid unto them, <HI>Act.</HI> xx. 28. <HI>Take heed unto your &s;elves, and unto all the Flock, over the
<PB N="39" REF="004145_0041_1003DE15F4357698">which the Holy Gho&s;t hath made you Over&s;eers, to feed the Church of God, which He hath purcha&s;ed with His own Blood.</HI></P>
<P>So we advi&s;e, and Charge you, to <HI>take heed unto your&s;elf.</HI> Let this be your fir&s;t and great Care, that you have your&s;elf felt the Power, and ta&s;ted the Sweet|ne&s;s of the divine Truths, that you may the more for|cibly recommend them unto others. Live under the con&s;tant realizing Belief of tho&s;e Truths, and View of the un&s;een World, which you invite others to believe, and hope for; and endeavour, in your Life, to exem|plify the Life of Chri&s;t, &s;hewing forth the Excellency of Piety and Devotion, Temperance and Purity, Meek|ne&s;ss and Humility, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Charity, in your daily Practice. Be a&s;&s;ured that a Conver&s;ation, contrary unto the Doctrine of Godline&s;s, will pull down with both Hands, what you &s;eem to attempt to build with one; and therefore, in all things, &s;hew your&s;elf a Pattern of good Works; be an Example unto the Be|liever, in Word, in Conver&s;ation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity; and &s;uffer no Man to de&s;pi&s;e your Youth.</P>
<P>We advi&s;e, and Charge you, to <HI>take heed unto all the Flock, over the which the Holy Gho&s;t hath made you a Bi&s;hop.</HI> Take thou the Over&s;ight hereof, not by Con|&s;traint, nor for filthy Lucre, but of a ready Mind. Remember that it is a Flock dearly bought, and paid for, with no le&s;s a Price than the Blood of Him who is God as well as Man. And &s;urely, what co&s;t the chief Shepherd &s;o dear, you, His under Shepherd ought by no Means to make light of: no; it &s;hould be dearer unto you than any thing in this World. The Holy Gho&s;t hath made you an Over&s;eer of it for this very End, that you &s;hould be careful of it, and diligently tend, and faithfully feed it; even all the Flock, the
<PB N="40" REF="004145_0042_1003DE1F4F414600">Sheep, and the Lambs, the young, and the old, the high, and the low, the rich, and the poor. For all Souls are alike precious in the Sight of God, and the poore&s;t co&s;t the incarnate Son of God as much to re|deem it, as the riche&s;t. And think not the Flock to be confined to the narrow Limits of tho&s;e that approach unto the Table of the Lord, but look upon every bap|ti&s;ed Per&s;on as belonging unto the Flock of Chri&s;t, until he reounces his Bapti&s;m; and let them all have, according to their different Circum&s;tances, their proper Portion of Food, of In&s;truction, Coun&s;el, Admonition, and Warning, admini&s;tred unto them, in due Sea&s;on: and do all you can to &s;trengthen the weak and feeble, and to recover them that wander, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;trong. Thus endeavour to build up and encrea&s;e this holy Church of the Lord Je&s;us, and confirm it in the Faith, and Order, of the Go&s;pel, as it is profe&s;&s;ed, and practi&s;ed, in the&s;e Churches, &s;o far as you &s;hall receive Light from the &s;acred Scriptures; and watch for their Souls, as one that mu&s;t give an Account.</P>
<P>Furthermore; we exhort and charge you, in the Style of the &s;ame Apo&s;tle to <HI>Archippus, Col.</HI> iv. 17. <HI>Take heed unto the Mini&s;try, which thou ha&s;t received of the Lord, that thou ful&s;il it.</HI> Remember, that you have received this Mini&s;try of the Lord JESUS, your Lord, and ours; and be very careful diligently, faithfully, and con&s;tantly, to attend all the Parts thereof. Fulfil thy Mini&s;try by preaching the Word, be in&s;tant in Sea&s;on, and out of Sea&s;on; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all Long&s;uffering, and Doctrine; not handling the Word of God deceitfully, but, by the manife&s;tation of the Truth, commending your&s;elf to every Man's Con|&s;cience, in the Sight of God. Let your Preaching be &s;criptural, plain, &s;erious, cogent. Admini&s;ter the Seals of the New Te&s;tament, Bapti&s;m, and the Supper of the Lord, unto all the proper Subjects thereof, as a wi&s;e
<PB N="41" REF="004145_0043_1003DE288ECAC228">and faithful Steward, putting a Difference between the holy, and the profane. Di&s;pen&s;e the holy Di&s;cipline of the Church without Pa&s;&s;ion, or Prejudice, with Cou|rage, and Re&s;olution, and yet with Wi&s;dom, and Pru|dence, and good Advice. And Ble&s;s the Congregation in the Name of the Lord. Neglect not the Gi&s;t that is in thee, but give thy &s;elf wholly unto the&s;e things, that your profiting may appear unto many; and &s;tudy to &s;hew your&s;elf approved of God, a Workman that needeth not to be a&s;hamed. Thus, we <HI>charge you before God, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the elect Angels; that thou ob&s;erve the&s;e things, without preferring one before another, doing nothing by Partiality.</HI></P>
<P>Once more; we exhort, and Charge you, in the Strain of the forementioned Apo&s;tle, to his Son <HI>Timothy;</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 16. <HI>Take heed unto thy Doctrine, continue in them.</HI> Remember, that it is the glorious Go&s;pel of the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> that is committed, as a &s;acred Depo&s;itum. unto you to keep pure and entire. Determine with your&s;elf to know, and &s;tudy, and preach, nothing &s;o much as JESUS CHRIST, and Him crucified; CHRIST, the End of the Law, the Author, and Sub|&s;tance of the Go&s;pel, the Wi&s;dom and Power of God unto Salvation. Suffer not the Doctrines of the Gof|pel to be corrupted thro' your Neglect; but hold fa&s;t the Form of &s;ound Words, which thou ha&s;t heard, in Faith, and Love, which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, avoiding profane and vain Babling, and oppo&s;ition of Science, fal&s;ly &s;o called. Diligently improve all the Helps, and Advantages you may have, to e&s;tabli&s;h you in the Truth, and that you may be able, by &s;ound Doc|trine, both to exhort, and to convince the Gain&s;ayer. And therefore give thy&s;elf to Reading, Meditation, and Prayer; for in &s;o doing thou &s;halt both &s;ave thy &s;elf, and them that hear thee. And that Good Thing which has been committed unto thee, keep, by the Holy
<PB N="42" REF="004145_0044_1003DE31C59AFB78">Gho&s;t, and the &s;ame commit thou unto faithful Men, who &s;hall be able to teach others al&s;o. Thus, we <HI>give thee Charge in the Sight of God, who quickeneth all things; and before Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who before Pontius Pilate witne&s;&s;ed a good Confe&s;&s;ion, that thou keep this Command|ment without Spot, unreprovable, unto the appearing of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Finally; Fora&s;much as the mini&s;terial Work has its Difficulties and Burdens, as well as its Honours, we would fairly warn you thereof, and exhort, and charge you, that you be &s;trong, and quit your&s;elf like a Man. The mo&s;t ea&s;y Part of your Work, and Station, we can a&s;&s;ure you, is eno' to demand your Vigilance, and Fortitude; and you will, we fear, have often Occa&s;ion to lament the Un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s of your Mini&s;try. But be&s;ides, you may rea&s;onably expect that Satan, and his In&s;truments, will often, and fiercely a&s;&s;ault you, &s;ince your great Bu&s;ine&s;s is to beat down the Kingdom of the wicked one. And we may tell you, <HI>Syr,</HI> that if tho&s;e you take to be your greate&s;t Friends, on whom you mo&s;tly depend, and are ready to &s;ay, the&s;e &s;ame &s;hall comfort me, and tho&s;e you have done the mo&s;t to &s;erve, &s;hould anon di&s;appoint your Expectation, and treat you unhand&s;omely, and, it may be, be the mo&s;t forward to &s;light, and abu&s;e you; you will only experience what others have done before you. Therefore arm your&s;elf with the &s;ame Mind that was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and keep a &s;trict Watch over your own Spirit: that a worldly Temper may not betray you into Meane&s;&s;es, and expo&s;e you unto Contempt; nor a pa&s;&s;ionate and controverting Spirit throw you into Mi&s;chief, and Con|&s;u&s;ion. As much as po&s;&s;ible avoid all Strife in your own Cau&s;e; choo&s;e rather patiently to bear what you meet withal: and while you are couragious, and re&s;o|lute in your Ma&s;ter's Cau&s;e, yet remember to &s;hew, out of a good Conver&s;ation, your Works with meek|ne&s;s
<PB N="43" REF="004145_0045_1003DE410CB8D218">of Wi&s;dom. We therefore addre&s;s you, in the Words of the Apo&s;tle, II. <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 1, 3. <HI>Thou there|fore, my Son, be &s;trong in the Grace that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us;&mdash;endure Hardne&s;s, as a good Souldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Remember whom you &s;erve, and look to, and depend upon him, for Help; and fear not the Faces of Men, neither &s;hun to declare unto them the whole Coun&s;el of God; and thus keep your&s;elf pure from the Blood of all Men.</P>
<P>Thus, Reverend, and Dear <HI>Syr,</HI> we call upon, ex|hort, and charge you, before God, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who &s;hall Judge the quick and the dead at His appearing, and Kingdom, that you take heed unto your&s;elf, and to all the Flock, over which the Holy Gho&s;t hath made you an Over&s;eer, to your Mini&s;try, and to your Doctrine, and arm your&s;elf again&s;t Temp|tations, and endure Tryals.</P>
<P>And verily, <HI>Syr,</HI> if you keep this Charge, and ap|prove your&s;elf a wi&s;e, and faithful, Steward of the My&s;teries of the Kingdom of God, and fulfil the Mi|ni&s;try which you have received of the Lord Je&s;us, know it of a Truth, that your Reward &s;hall be un|&s;peakably great: the Lord of Ho&s;ts will number you among His Angels, who doubtle&s;s ob&s;erve the pre&s;ent Solemnities, and the Vow of God which you have now taken upon you, and you &s;hall <HI>&s;hine as the Brightne&s;s of the Firmament, and as the Starrs for ever and ever; and, when the chief Shepherd &s;hall appear, you &s;hall re|ceive a Crown of Glory, which fadeth not away.</HI></P>

<P>THE Ceremony of giving <HI>the Right Hand of Fel|low&s;hip,</HI> tho' it be not an e&s;&s;ential Requi&s;ite to the Ordination of Mini&s;ters (the Validity and Suffici|ency whereof being in the Nature of the Thing &s;up|pos'd as previous to it) yet being, in general, founded on Scripture-Warrant, and not an U&s;age that owes its Ri&s;e to humane Invention, it &s;eems but a ju&s;t and proper Acknowledgement to be paid to tho&s;e that are regularly and &s;olemnly &s;et apart to the Work of the Evangelical Mini&s;try, and on the Occa&s;ion of &s;uch their Seperation and &s;olemn Introduction to that &s;acred Of|fice.</P>
