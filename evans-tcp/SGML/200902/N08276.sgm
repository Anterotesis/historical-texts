<P>THE Town then took into Con&s;ideration the Petition of a Number of Inhabitants,
<Q>That &s;ome effectual Mea&s;ures might be agreed upon to promote Indu&s;try, Oe|conomy, and Manufactures; thereby to prevent the unnece&s;&s;ary Importation of Euro|pean Commodities, which threaten the Country with Poverty and Ruin:</Q> Whereupon in a very large and full Meeting, the following Votes and Re&s;olutions were pa&s;&s;ed Unanimou&s;ly.</P>
<P><HI>Whereas the exce&s;&s;ive U&s;e of foreign Superfluities is the chief Cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State of this Town, as it is thereby drained of its Money; which Misfortune is likely to be increa&s;ed by Means of the late additional Burthens and Impo&s;itions on the Trade of the Province, which threaten the Coun|try with Poverty and Ruin:</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, <HI>VOTED,</HI> That this Town will take all prudent and legal Mea&s;ures to encourage the Produce and Manufactures of this Province, and to le&s;&s;en the U&s;e of Superfluities, &amp; particularly the fol|lowing enumerated Articles imported from Abroad, viz. <HI>Loaf Sugar, Cordage, Anchors, Coaches, Chai&s;es and Carriages of all Sorts, Hor&s;e Furniture, Men and Womens Hatts, Mens and Womens Apparel ready made, Hou&s;hold Furniture, Gloves, Mens and Womens Shoes, Sole-Leather, Sheathing and Deck Nails, Gold and Silver and Thread Lace of all Sorts, Gold and Silver Buttons, Wrought Plate of all Sorts, Dia|mond, Stone and Pa&s;te Ware, Snuff, Mu&s;tard, Clocks and Watches, Silver&s;miths and Jewellers Ware, Broad Cloths that co&s;t above 10<ABBR>s.</ABBR> per Yard, Muffs Furrs and Tippets, and all Sorts of Millenary Ware, Starch, Womens and Childrens Stays, Fire Engines, China Ware, Silk and Cotton Velvets, Gauze, Pew|terers hollow Ware, Lin&s;eed Oyl, Glue, Lawns, Cam|bricks, Silks of all Kinds for Garments, Malt Li|quors and Chee&s;e.</HI>&mdash;And that a Sub&s;cription for this End be and hereby is recommended to the &s;e|veral Inhabitants and Hou&s;holders of the Town; and that <HI>John Rowe,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Mr. <HI>William Greenlea&s;e, Melatiah Bourne,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Mr. <HI>Samuel Au&s;tin,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edward Payne,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edmund Quincy,</HI> Tertius, <HI>John Ruddock,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>Jonathan Williams,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>Jo&s;hua Hen&s;haw,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Mr. <HI>Hender&s;on Inches,</HI> Mr. <HI>Solomon Davis, Jo&s;hua Win&s;low</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and <HI>Thomas Cu&s;hing,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> be a Committee to prepare a Form for Sub|&s;cription, to report the &s;ame as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and al&s;o to procure Sub&s;criptions to the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>And whereas it is the Opinion of this Town, that divers new Manufactures may be &s;et up in</HI> Ame|rica, <HI>to its great Advantage, and &s;ome others carried to a greater Extent, particularly tho&s;e of Gla&s;s &amp; Paper</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, <HI>Voted,</HI> That this Town will by all prudent Ways and Means, encourage the U&s;e and Con&s;umption of Gla&s;s and Paper, made in any of the Briti&s;h American Colonies; and more e&s;peci|ally in this Province.</P>

<P><HI>WHEREAS this Province labours under a heavy Debt, incurred in the Cour&s;e of the late War; and the Inhabitants by this Means mu&s;t be for &s;ome Time &s;ubject to very burthen&s;ome Taxes: &mdash; And as our Trade has for &s;ome Years been on the decline, and is now particularly under great Em|barra&s;sments, and burthened with heavy Impo&s;itions, our Medium very &s;carce, and the Balance of Trade greatly again&s;t this Country:</HI></P>
<P>WE therefore the Sub&s;cribers, being &s;en&s;ible that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in Order to extricate us out of the&s;e embarra&s;&s;ed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Circum&s;tan|ces, to promote Indu&s;try, Oeconomy and Manu|factures among our&s;elves, and by this Means pre|vent the unnece&s;&s;ary Importation of European Com|modities, the exce&s;&s;ive U&s;e of which threatens the Country with Poverty and Ruin&mdash;DO promi&s;e and engage, to and with each other, that we will en|courage the U&s;e and Con&s;umption of all Articles manufactured in any of the Briti&s;h American Co|lonies, and more e&s;pecially in this Province; and that we will not, from and after the 31&s;t of <HI>Decem|ber</HI> next en&s;uing, purcha&s;e any of the following Articles, imported from Abroad, viz. <HI>Loaf Sugar,</HI> and all the other Articles enumerated above.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>And we further agree &s;trictly to adhere to the late Regulation re&s;pecting Funerals, and will not u&s;e any Gloves but what are Manufactured here, nor procure any new Garments upon &s;uch an Occa|&s;ion, but what &s;hall be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</HI></P>
<P>The above Report having been con&s;idered, the Que&s;tion was put, Whether the &s;ame &s;hall be ac|cepted? <HI>Voted unanimou&s;ly in the Affirmative.</HI>
&mdash;And that &s;aid Committee be de&s;ired to u&s;e their be&s;t Endeavours to get the Sub&s;cription Papers filled up as &s;oon as may be. Al&s;o, <HI>Voted unani|mou&s;ly,</HI> That the foregoing Vote and Form of a Sub&s;cription relative to the enumerated Articles, be immediately Publi&s;hed; and that the Selectmen be directed to di&s;tribute a proper Number of them among the Freeholders of this Town; and to for|ward a Copy of the &s;ame to the Select-Men of every Town in the Province; as al&s;o to the principal City or Town Officers of the chief Towns in the &s;everal Colonies on the Continent, as they may think proper.</P>
