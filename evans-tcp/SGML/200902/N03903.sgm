<Q><BIBL>1 PET. 1.24, 5.</BIBL>
<P>All Fle&s;h is as Gra&s;s, and all the Glory of Man, as the Flower of Gra&s;s. The Gra&s;s withereth, and the Flower thereof falleth away: But the Word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the Word which by the Go&s;pel is preached unto you.</P></Q>

<P>_HAVING obtained Help from GOD, we continue to the fir&s;t Day in the <HI>New Year:</HI> Others have their Days num|bred and fini&s;hed, and are &s;ent down to the Grave which celebrateth not God's Name, while we are &s;till among the Living, the living to Prai&s;e him this Day, and hear the Words of Life from him. O that this Goodne&s;s of God may lead us to Repentance! that this Patience may be Salvation to us! ToDay, while it is called to Day, if ye will hear God's Voice, harden not your Hearts. And what more

quickning Motive can I offer to excite you to this Duty, than my Text affords us; the Con&s;idera|tion of the frailty of Man re&s;pecting his fir&s;t Birth, and as he is a Child of apo&s;tate <HI>Adam;</HI> and of the immortal Life he is begotten to, when he receiveth the incorruptible Seed of the Word of God into his Heart, of that God who liveth and abideth for ever.</P>
<P>Here then we may con&s;ider from the Words the following Ob&s;ervations,</P>
<P N="1">I. Man is Fle&s;h; weak and frail as the Gra&s;s. II. All the Glory of Man is as the Flower of Gra&s;s. III. As &s;uch a fading Creature he withers &amp; falls by Death. IV. The Word of the Lord endureth for ever. V. This is the Word which by the Go&s;|pel is preached unto you.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Man is Fle&s;h; weak and frail as the Gra&s;s.</HI> Man is call'd Fle&s;h. <HI>All Fle&s;h has corrupted his Way upon the Earth,</HI> Gen. 6. 12. Such is his Body, and his Soul is defil'd with fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts. <HI>That which is born of the Fle&s;h, is Fle&s;h,</HI> Joh. 3.6. Indeed in his original Con&s;titution, Man had not the Seeds of Corruption &s;own in his Nature; no, <HI>Adam</HI> was made in God's Image, and after his Likene&s;s; a Candidate for a ble&s;&s;ed Immortality: But when he had tran&s;gre&s;s'd his Maker's Law by eating the forbidden Fruit, that Threatning was denounc'd, <HI>Du&s;t thou art, and unto Du&s;t thou &s;halt return,</HI> Gen. 3. 19 As Gra&s;s Man &s;prings out of the Earth, being form'd out of the Du&s;t re&s;pecting his Body. It's true, his Body was at fir&s;t, a noble Structure in which <HI>Adam</HI> appear'd in excellent Maje&s;ty as the Head over the brute Creation. And here the meane&s;s of the Materials out of which he was form'd was a &s;oil to the divine Power and Skill of the

Creator. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Materiam &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">perabat opus.</NOTE> And even &s;ince the Fall has mar'd God's Workman&s;hip, impair'd the Strength, and defac'd the Beauty of it; &s;till there's rea&s;on to &s;ing the Prai&s;es of our Maker in the Words of the royal P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>I will prai&s;e thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made,</HI> P&s;al. 139. 14. And I may add, no le&s;s wonderfully pre&s;erved; for as the Gra&s;s, our Life is now exceeding frail, and liable to be bla&s;ted by every Wind. <HI>As for Man his Days are as Gra&s;s: as a Flower of the Field, &s;o be flouri&s;h|eth. For the Wind pa&s;&s;eth over it, and it is gone; and the Place thereof &s;hall know it no more,</HI> P&s;al. 103.15, 16. And accordingly as Gra&s;s, when Man has &s;tood for a little time, he falls to the Earth, and in his Di&s;&s;olution returns to it. Even &s;uch as are now in their Verdure, may &s;ay, the time of our Depar|ture is at Hand. For what is <HI>your Life?</HI> It is even a <HI>Vapour</HI> that appeareth for a little time, and then vani&s;heth away. <HI>Surely the People is Gra&s;s,</HI> I&s;ai. 40. 7. All Orders of Men, whether they be high or low, rich or poor, young or old, agree in this; they are all as Gra&s;s, frail dying Creatures. And this leads me to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>All the Glory of Man is as the Flower of Gra&s;s, Verily every Man at his be&s;t State is altogether vanity,</HI> P&s;al. 39. 5. Suppo&s;e him to be flouri&s;hing in Beauty, Health, and the mo&s;t agreable outward Circum&s;tan|ces of Wealth, Honour, Friends, and the like; in all this Glory, Man is but a fading Flower, like the <HI>Lilies</HI> of the Field. Yea, this Compari&s;on is not too low for <HI>Solomon</HI> in all his Glory; for our Lord a&s;&s;ureth us, <HI>he was not arayed like one of the&s;e,</HI> Mat. 6. 29. Even the&s;e Works of God which are to Day, and to Morrow are ca&s;t into the Oven, appear with inimitable Lu&s;tre in their fine and beautiful Colours, va&s;tly exceeding all humane Art. But
<PB N="4" REF="004802_0006_100DF1B14ED89150">
why do we &s;et our Eyes upon that which is not? While we behold this peri&s;hing Creature, it fadeth and vani&s;heth away. <HI>Surely Men of high Degree are a lie: to be laid in the Balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity,</HI> P&s;al. 62. 9. Which brings me to the third Head,</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>As &s;uch a frail Creature, Man withereth, and falls by Death.</HI> As the Flower of the Gra&s;s he pa&s;&s;eth away. <HI>For the Sun is no &s;ooner ri&s;en with a burning heat, but it withereth the Gra&s;s, and the Flower thereof falleth, and the Grace of the fa&s;hion of it peri&s;heth,</HI> Jam. I. II. So do we fade away. <HI>My Days are like a Shadow that declineth: and I am withered like Gra&s;s,</HI> P&s;al. 102. 11. How feeble are we from our Birth! How brittle is our Con&s;titution! We be|gin to die as &s;oon as we begin to live. We are continually changing and wearing away as we pa&s;s the different Scenes of Life, and at Death that Word is fulfil'd, <HI>Thou prevaile&s;t for ever again&s;t him, and he pa&s;&s;eth: thou change&s;t his Countenance, and &s;ende&s;t him away,</HI> Job 14. 20. Almo&s;t every thing we conver&s;e with in this pa&s;&s;ing World would teach us this plain Truth. Particularly, our <HI>daily Food.</HI> We live upon the Dead. The Fle&s;h of brute Crea|tures fed with Gra&s;s and then &s;lain, is a con&s;idera|ble Part of our Livelihood. And can a Life thus &s;upported endure always? No &s;urely. Every Meal puts us in Mind of tho&s;e Words, <HI>Meats for the Belly, and the Belly for Meats; but God &s;hall de&s;troy both it and them,</HI> 1 Cor. 6. 13. How careful then &s;hould we be to glorify God, whether we eat or drink? How watchful over our &s;elves, le&s;t by any Exce&s;&s;es we &s;hould further &s;horten this frail Life? And how earne&s;t &s;hould we be in &s;eeking the living Bread which came down from Heaven, that we may eat and live for ever? Even the Fle&s;h of the Son of God, which he hath Given for the Life of the World. O <HI>labour, not for the Meat which pe|ri&s;heth, but for that Meat which endureth unto ever|la&s;ting
<PB N="5" REF="004802_0007_100DF1B39FB76A50">
Life.</HI> But it's time I return from this Di|gre&s;&s;ion. We may each one of us &s;ay with <HI>Job, Is my Strength the Strength of Stones? or is my Fle&s;h of Bra&s;s?</HI> No, it is much more fitly compar'd to the Gra&s;s. Our Fle&s;h is a little mouldring loo&s;e Earth, &s;oon crumbled and broken to Pieces. O frail Man! why do&s;t thou boa&s;t thy &s;elf in Vanity? Let the &s;erious Con&s;ideration of thy ha&s;tening Di&s;&s;olution hide Pride from thee. You may &s;ay <HI>to Corruption,</HI> Thou <HI>art my Father;</HI> to the <HI>Worm,</HI> Thou art <HI>my Mother,</HI> and <HI>my Si&s;ter.</HI> Glory not then in thy Strength or Beauty, Wealth or Honour; but rather lie down in the Du&s;t before the Lord of Life, and bewail thy Sin which hath &s;tain'd thy Glory with the Shadow of Death, and turn'd thy Beauty into Corruption. <HI>Bury my Dead out of my Sight.</HI> And yet again I &s;ay to thee, Lift up thy Head, and behold thy Saviour offering to rai&s;e you to an im|mortal Life by his Word and Spirit, a Life much better than that which you forfeited and lo&s;t by the original Apo&s;tacy. O that this may be the Hour in which &s;uch as are dead in Sins &s;hall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and live!</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>The Word of the Lord endureth for ever.</HI> Now this is here &s;poken in oppo&s;ition to the frail peri&s;hing Condition of Man, con&s;ider him in his unregenerate State, and as born of the Fle&s;h. As he proceeds from the <HI>fir&s;t Adam,</HI> he is altogether Vanity, and whatever appears excellent in him, mu&s;t &s;oon vani&s;h away; but then in the Word, CHRIST the <HI>&s;econd Adam</HI> is reveal'd and offer'd to us, who hath aboli&s;hed Death, and brought Life and Immortality to Light by the Go&s;pel; and we have a new and living Way open'd to Glory and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. Sin is expiated by one perfect Offer|ing of our great High Prie&s;t, God-Man; and the Holy Spirit purchas'd to &s;anctity God's People, and

&s;o prepare them for eternal Life in Heaven. A|greably we read that God's People are <HI>born again not of corruptible Seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</HI> ver. 23. Context. When the <HI>Son</HI> of God who is the <HI>e&s;&s;ential and eternal Word</HI> is pleas'd to make u&s;e of the <HI>Word written,</HI> and accompany it with the divine Influence of his Spirit; then the Word of God is quick and powerful, it is Spirit and Life; the ble&s;&s;ed Mean of be getting a new and &s;piritual Life in God's Peo|ple, and of nouri&s;hing it to eternal Life. Of the Son, who is call'd the <HI>Word of God,</HI> Rev. 19. 13. it may be &s;aid in the highe&s;t Sen&s;e, that he liveth and abideth for ever, re&s;pecting his Divine Nature. This true &amp; faithful Witne&s;s declareth, <HI>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning &amp; the ending, &s;aith the Lord, which is, &amp; which was, and which is to come,</HI> Rev. 1. 8. And as Mediator, God <HI>has given him Power over all Fle&s;h, that be &s;hould give eternal Life to as many as thou ba&s;t given him,</HI> Joh. 17. 2. Indeed I do not &s;ay that the Word is here nextly to be under&s;tood of the Son of God per&s;onally; but then it is to be under&s;tood of the Word of the Go&s;pel as it is the Word of Chri&s;t, and as it is breath'd into the Hearts of his People by his Spirit. And this Name &s;eems to have been given to our Lord Je&s;us, not only as God utter'd his mighty Voice by him, and &s;pake the World into being. <HI>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The &s;ame was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any Thing made that was made,</HI> Joh 1. 1, to 3. But al&s;o as God <HI>&s;peaks</HI> to his People the <HI>Word of Life by him,</HI> and <HI>createth</HI> the <HI>new Heavens and the new Earth, Wherein dwelleth Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Accordingly, tho&s;e Words Heb. 4. 12. <HI>For the Word of God is quick, and powerful, and &s;harper than any two-edged Sword, pier|cing even to the dividing a&s;under of Soul and Spirit,

<P>From the Promi&s;e made to our fir&s;t Parents, which contains a Threatning again&s;t the old Ser|pent the Devil, that God would de&s;troy this evil One with his Works, <HI>I will put Enmity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed: it &s;hall brui&s;e thy Head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his Heel,</HI> Gen. 3. 15. we may date the Go&s;pel Revelation, which we may &s;uppo&s;e was handed down by <HI>oral Tradition,</HI> and al&s;o further pre&s;erved and enlarged by God's appearing and revealing him&s;elf and his Will to his People as there was occa&s;ion for it. We are a&s;&s;ur'd that <HI>God at &s;undry Times, and in divers Manners, &s;pake in Time pa&s;t unto the Fathers by the Prophets,</HI> Heb. 1. 1. Afterwards, for the better pre&s;erving of the Word, it was by God's Direction committed unto writing. Holy Men &s;pake, and they wrote the Word of God, as moved by the Holy Gho&s;t.

Writing was not communicated to Men before <HI>Mo&s;es's</HI> Time; for <HI>Joh</HI> who is &s;uppos'd to live before him, &s;ays, <HI>O that my Words were now writ|ten!</HI> Chap. 19. 23. But to return, after this the Word of God was written by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and other in|&s;pired Pen-men. Our Lord owns the Writings of the <HI>Old Te&s;timent</HI> in u&s;e in his Day, as authentick. They have <HI>Mo&s;es and the Prophets; let them hear them,</HI> Luk. 16. 29. <HI>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal Life, &amp; they are they which te&s;tify of me,</HI> Joh. 5. 39 And God has &s;ince wonderfully pre&s;erv'd the &s;acred Writings of the old and new Te&s;tament; own'd and ble&s;s'd them in every Age down to our Times, by making them the great In|&s;trument of convincing and converting Sinners, and of building up Believers on their holy Faith. This Foundation of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and <HI>Prophets,</HI> wherein <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is reveal'd and doctrinally exhibited as the <HI>chief Corner Stone,</HI> none could ever remove.

The&s;e great and precious Promi&s;es &s;hall for ever be fulfil'd in that far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory, which God will be&s;tow on his faithful Peo|ple in the heavenly Places. The <HI>Threatnings</HI> of God's Word &s;hall al&s;o be <HI>fulfil'd.</HI> The old Ser|pent is ready &s;till to tempt Sinners, as he did the Mother of all living, <HI>Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die.</HI> But our Lord and Judge a&s;&s;ureth us, that <HI>the&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment,</HI> Math. 25.46.

We read of the <HI>Sun's going down at Noon,</HI> Amos 8 9. Yea, the Shadows of Death have reach'd many before the Morning of Life was pa&s;t, <HI>The young Men are dead,</HI> Job 1. 19. Make ha&s;te to Chri&s;t then, le&s;t the Strength of Youth fail before you have laid hold on eternal Life. Let the <HI>great Men</HI> who&s;e Wealth and outward Glory are increa&s;ing, remember that Man being in Honour abideth not, his Glory &s;hall not de&s;cend after him. O let not the&s;e peri&s;hing Things then hinder you from &s;eeking durable Riches and Righteou&s;ne&s;s in Chri&s;t Je&s;us! Let not the Riches or Cares or Plea&s;ures of this Life choke the Word, that it &s;hould become unfruitful. For we are not redeemed from Sin and Death with corruptible Things, as Silver and Gold; but with the precious Blood of Chri&s;t.

La&s;tly, Let Chri&s;t's <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> preach the Word, and the <HI>People</HI> hear it, under the impre&s;&s;ive Belief of the&s;e important Truths. O con&s;ider, you are as Gra&s;s; but the Word of the Lord endureth for ever!</P>
<P>To Conclude,</P>
<P>This remarkable Year of <HI>forty one</HI> may put us in Mind of God's awful Judgments, particularly in the <HI>bloody Ma&s;&s;acre</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> wherein about Two Hundred Thou&s;and Prote&s;tants were accounted as Sheep for the Slaughter by inhumane Butchers, under the In&s;tigation of the <HI>Whore of Babylon,</HI> whom the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> &s;aw in Vi&s;ion <HI>drunken with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Je&s;us,</HI> Rev. 17. 6. How were the Peo|ple as Gra&s;s in that terrible Day of the Lord! <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">This horrible Rebellion began October 23.1641. See <HI>Whitlooke's</HI> Memoirs, and Sir <HI>John Temple's</HI> Hi&s;tory of the Iri&s;h Rebellion. The Rev. Dr. <HI>Daniel Williams,</HI> who liv'd many Years in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> hath the&s;e Words, "Two Hundred Thou&s;and Prote&s;tants were de&s;troy'd by the&s;e bloody Men. Many, at the fir&s;t breaking out of this Rebellion, were invited to Fea&s;ts by the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and butcher'd at the Entertainment: Mere dying was a Kindne&s;s; tediou&s;ne&s;s and barbarity mu&s;t heighten their Slaughters; they &s;trip'd Multitudes, and forced them to pe|ri&s;h by Cold and Famine in that hard Winter Crowds were burnt together in Barns; many driven into Rivers, and &s;uch as attempted to e&s;cape, were forced back to peri&s;h in the Waters. Women with Child they rip'd open; poor Babes they to&s;&s;ed on Pikes, as plea&s;ing Sport. Candles were made of Man's Grea&s;e; no Intreaties of Women or Children could induce to Pity. &mdash;Thank&s;giving Sermon preach'd <HI>October</HI> 22. 1689. for the Prote&s;tants Deliverance from the <HI>Iri&s;h Rebellion.</HI></NOTE> O that <HI>Great Britain!</HI> O that <HI>Ireland</HI> would hear the Voice of the Son of God, to whom the Father hath committed all Judgment; <HI>Except ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="004802_0026_100DF1DCDA0B5008">And the Year we now enter upon, brings our Affairs to a very difficult <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> in which a Sove|reign God writes Vanity on our worldly Glory. Let us then hear the Voice of his Word and Pro|vidence, and be excited to lay up Trea&s;ures in Heaven. Let us make &s;ure of the Ble&s;&s;ing's of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t; that we may be carried well thro' all the Troubles of this Life, and be prepat'd for that Inheritance which is incorruptible, and that fadeth not away.</P>
