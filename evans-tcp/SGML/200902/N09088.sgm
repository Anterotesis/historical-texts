<P>THE duty, as well as priviledge of mankind, in this matter, is not le&s;s evident, being clearly dedu|cible, by the light of rea&s;on, from the nature of things, and fully pointed out both as to matter and manner, by expre&s;s revelation from heaven.

It is but rational and ju&s;t, that we &s;hould acknowledge and adore the perfection and excellen|cies of that glorious being, to whom we are indebt|ed for exi&s;tence, upon whom we depend for pre&s;er|vation and &s;upport in life, and to whom we may look and in whom we may &s;afely tru&s;t, for the be|&s;towment of every ble&s;&s;ing, nece&s;&s;ary to our well-being

<P>VARIOUS are the ways, in which the&s;e religious acknowledgments may be, and are, acceptably made unto God; both <HI>internally</HI> and <HI>externally.</HI> As, in private, in publick&mdash;&s;eperately, by individuals,&mdash; &s;ocially, by &s;ocieties, or a&s;&s;emblies of men, adoring and wor&s;hipping GOD, and giving him that glory which is due to his name.</P>
<P><HI>Internally,</HI> this is done, and this important duty is acceptably di&s;charged, by the devotion of the heart, or the unre&s;erved dedication of the &s;oul to God; and by cultivating a deep, con&s;tant and great|ful &s;en&s;e of our indebtedne&s;s, dependence and obli|gations. &mdash;Herein does the e&s;&s;ence of piety towards God con&s;i&s;t &mdash;Hence the intrin&s;ic excellency,&mdash;hence the vital influence of religion takes its ri&s;e.

<P><HI>Externally,</HI> This priviledge is improved, and this duty di&s;charged, by &s;uch acts of religion and wor&s;hip, as, by the light of rea&s;on, appear in their own nature &s;uited, or by immediate and expre&s;s re|velation are appointed, to repre&s;ent the inward &s;enti|ments of the heart and the internal devotion of the &s;oul towards GOD, as becomes his creatures, depen|dent upon and accountable to him. So far, there|fore, as the outward acts of religion, and religious &s;ervices and in&s;titutions, are attended upon and di&s;|charged with this view,&mdash;&s;o far as they are truly ex|pre&s;&s;ive of the real &s;entiments and devotion of the heart and &s;oul to GOD; &s;o far (and no farther) are they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> well-plea&s;ing in his &s;ight.&mdash; Externals in religion are but the <HI>garb,</HI> or <HI>&s;hell</HI>&mdash; The love of the heart, the &s;incere devotion of the &s;oul, is the &s;ub&s;tance, and what is chiefly and ulti|mately to be attended to; but the other is not to be neglected.&mdash;Both are to have a proper regard, according to the place they hold in the &s;cale of im|portance. Neither are to be omitted; though it is beyond di&s;pute, that the le&s;s is to give place to the greater, when brought into compari&s;on.&mdash;When our

ble&s;&s;ed LORD &s;aw the punctitious regard the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> paid, to &s;ome external rites and cere|monies of their religion, while their gro&s;s neglect of many things of highe&s;t importance to virtue and god|line&s;s, and vital religion, was too notorious to be concealed, he &s;everely reproved them, &s;aying, "<HI>Wo unto you Scribes and Phari&s;ees,</HI> hypocrites; For ye pay tithe of mint, anni&s;e and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith: <HI>The&s;e ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</HI>" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. 23.23.</NOTE> This pa&s;&s;age is evident|ly applicable to the point in view, and exhibits the le&s;&s;on, we have endeavoured to &s;ugge&s;t, in too legi|ble characters to need any comment.</P>
<P>THERE are a variety of ways, in which the devo|tion of the heart, to a glorious GOD, may be fitly exerci&s;ed, profitably cultivated and &s;trongly expre&s;sed, in the external acts of religion; either di&s;cretionally, according to the be&s;t light of our own minds, or in obedience to ordinances and in&s;titutions of divine appointment. But, in general, all religious acts and external &s;ervices of this nature, may be con&s;idered as reducible to, or virtually included in, or couched under, the&s;e two&punc; mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive branches of devo|tion, prayer and prai&s;e. Both <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>prai&s;e</HI> equal|ly &s;uppo&s;e and include in them, a full and unre&s;erved acknowledgment of the Deity and adoration of his perfections. Both are alike expre&s;&s;ive of our depen|dence upon GOD and of our obligations to him. And by whatever devotional acts, our de&s;ires and greatful acknowledgments are expre&s;&s;ed, in both prayer and prai&s;e, our tru&s;t, fear, love, gratitude, hope, and even all
<PB N="11" REF="011601_0009_0F87799061036E68">
the pious and religious affections, towards the glori|ous Being whom we wor&s;hip and adore, are truly engaged and devoutly expre&s;&s;ed. In a word, pray|er and prai&s;e alike include and expre&s;s, (when at|tended aright) a filial acknowledgment of our intire &s;ubjection to divine government, and the righteous di&s;po&s;als of a wi&s;e providence in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, and of our accountablene&s;s to GOD, at la&s;t, as our rightful &s;overeign and final judge. The&s;e &s;entiments ought always to be kept in mind and deeply im|pre&s;&s;ed on the heart, as entering into the nature of devotion, and as e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to render devoti|onal acts and &s;ervices well plea&s;ing to GOD.</P>
<P><HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Prai&s;e,</HI> as they are emphatically the two grand con&s;tituent parts of religious wor&s;hip, or devotion, and as they are jointly expre&s;&s;ive of all the pious affections towards GOD, are very frequently, if not always joined together, in acts of homage and religious addre&s;&s;es to him. Agreably, an eminent apo&s;tle, who well under&s;tood the nature and obliga|tions of religion, and e&s;pecially of devotion, in our addre&s;&s;es to GOD, expre&s;ly enjoins, that we "be careful for nothing: But in <HI>every thing</HI> by prayer and &s;upplication, with thanksgiving, let our re|que&s;ts be made known unto GOD." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. 4.6.</NOTE> So that it may fitly be &s;aid, that prayer and prai&s;e do, for the mo&s;t part, if not always, involve one another in the &s;ame acts of devotion. Are we reque&s;ting the be&s;tow|ment of any needed ble&s;&s;ings, a greatful &s;en&s;e of di|vine goodne&s;s already experienced, is not only beco|ming our character as dependent creatures, and pe|titioners, but al&s;o a good argument of our hope and tru&s;t in GOD, as able and ready to do us good; and,
<PB N="12" REF="011601_0010_0F877991188242F0">
at the &s;ame time e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, as a qualifica|tion to render us accepted of GOD, in our &s;upplica|tions, and meet for the reception of mercies reque&s;t|ed. In this way, pa&s;t mercies, of which the people of GOD have a greatful &s;en&s;e, are often pled with good &s;ucce&s;s, as an argument for granting the fa|vours they &s;eek. Numberle&s;s have been the in&s;tan|ces of this, recorded for our in&s;truction and encou|ragement, in the &s;acred pages.&mdash;On the other hand, are we expre&s;&s;ing our greatful acknowledgements, for ble&s;&s;ings received, and giving of thanks at the remembrance of his goodne&s;s and grace, to renew the acknowledgment of our dependence upon GOD, and devoutly to implore the continuance of his pro|vidence and ble&s;&s;ing, and earne&s;tly to &s;eek his grace and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to a wi&s;e improvement of his favours, is, at once, to expre&s;s the &s;incerity of our de&s;ires in prai&s;ing his name, and the ardour of our &s;ouls to make &s;uch returns, of love and obedience, as, in con&s;equence of his goodne&s;s, he has a right to ex|pect. Thus to offer prai&s;e, is to glorify GOD.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, though <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>prai&s;e</HI> are thus in|terwoven, and practically &s;peaking, can &s;carcely be &s;eperated, in acts of devotion; yet they may be, and are ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed, in theory and &s;peculation, and may fitly be con&s;idered, as expre&s;&s;ive of the ge|neral and main de&s;ign of devotional acts, to which they are applied: The former as denominating an act of wor&s;hip, as being of the nature of &s;upplicati|on and reque&s;t, for favours needed; and the latter, as denoting an act of homage, as being of the na|ture of gratitude and thankfulne&s;s, for ble&s;&s;ings re|ceived. In either, and in both, when done in true devotion, and from the heart, as the divine perfecti|tions
<PB N="13" REF="011601_0011_0F877991DCB51B18">
are acknowledged and adored, GOD is plea&s;ed to accept his &s;incere wor&s;hippers, and account him|&s;elf grorified.&mdash;It is the <HI>latter</HI> of the&s;e (tho' not to the exclu&s;ion of the <HI>former</HI>) to which our attention is called, upon this occa&s;ion, and which is, more e&s;pecially, the &s;ubject of our text and the P&s;alm before us.</P>
<P>WHAT particular occa&s;ion this P&s;alm was wrote upon&mdash;whether to celebrate &s;ome &s;ignal victory, over the enemies of GOD's people&mdash;or to expre&s;s the joy of GOD's people, upon the bringing the ark of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">enant of GOD, into the city of David, which was done with great pomp, &s;olemnity and rejoicings; or whether it is to be con&s;idered as prophetic of the kingdom of Chri&s;t, the glory of the church, in the go&s;gel day; to u&s;her in which, our ble&s;&s;ed LORD, in glorious triumph, <HI>a&s;cended on high, led captivity captive, and received gifts for men;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 68.18.</NOTE> (I &s;ay) whether it is to be con&s;idered, as referring to either of the&s;e, or any other remarkable events, which the p&s;almi&s;t might have immediately in view, is not ea&s;y for us to determine, at this di&s;tance of time. Neither is a certainty, in this ca&s;e, of any &s;pecial importance to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. For be the immediate occa&s;ion of it, what it will, the &s;ubject, and practical u&s;e of it, to GOD's church and people, in every age, are the &s;ame, and will be &s;o to the end of time. It is an exhorta|tion to prai&s;e the LORD, in &s;everal acts expre&s;&s;ive of this part of devotion. Particularly, by <HI>clapping of hands, &s;houting,</HI> and <HI>&s;inging.</HI>&mdash;"O clap your hands, all ye people, &s;hout unto GOD with the voice of triumph: For the LORD mo&s;t high is terrible; he is a great

<P><HI>Prai&s;e,</HI> is expre&s;&s;ive of that part of devotion, in which we celebrate the divine perfections, in the various di&s;plays of them, in the works of nature, providence and grace; in which GOD's people great|ly acknowledge, and particularly celebrate, any &s;pe|cial favours and ble&s;&s;ings, they have received, and and in which they expre&s;s their faith, hope and tru&s;t in GOD, and make it their concern to render to the LORD the glory due to his name. Agreable to that mo&s;t pathetic wi&s;h of the holy P&s;almi&s;t, &s;o often mentioned in the hundred and &s;eventh P&s;alm&mdash;"Oh that men would prai&s;e the LORD, for his goodne&s;s, and for his wonderful works to the children of men"&punc;</P>
<P>VARIOUS have been the ways in which GOD's peo|ple, in the &s;everal ages of the church and the world, have expre&s;&s;ed their grateful acknowledgments to him and endeavoured to prai&s;e his name: And various have been the religious rites, in&s;titutions, means and acts attended upon and u&s;ed, by the &s;aints, to excite and a&s;&s;i&s;t in this part of devotion.</P>
<P>AS to the fir&s;t ages of the church, we have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, as &s;acred hi&s;tory is in a great mea&s;ure &s;ilent upon this &s;ubject, that the &s;aints and people of GOD, under the common guidance of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit, were left very much, to their own di&s;cretion, both as to means of exciting and manner of perfor|ming this part of their duty and this branch of di|vine wor&s;hip.

LORD &s;earches the hearts,&mdash;He trieth the reins."&mdash; Our &s;ongs of prai&s;e unle&s;s attended with true devo|tion, <HI>with the &s;pirit,</HI> as well as under&s;tanding, will be deemed no better than vain oblations, which are an offence to GOD. Yea, though we are ever &s;o well &s;killed in mu&s;ic, and though the &s;ound of our voices, in the external acts of wor&s;hip, have been plea&s;ant and engaging, as harmony it&s;elf&mdash;and though we have &s;hone in the church, as bright ex|amples of highe&s;t attainments in this part of divine wor&s;hip, all will be in vain, if our hearts are not right in the &s;ight of GOD:&mdash;Our expectations will fail, when GOD &s;hall take away the &s;oul; and our hope &s;hall be like the <HI>&s;piders web,</HI> which, in death, will yield us no &s;upport.&mdash;To alarm, awaken, and put us upon our guard, again&s;t a mi&s;take &s;o dange|rous and fatal, let us be per&s;uaded to look forward and con&s;ider how awful, how di&s;tre&s;&s;ing it mu&s;t be, at death, to change the &s;cenes; and from being engaged in the delightful &s;ervice of <HI>mu&s;ic</HI> and &s;inging prai&s;es with GOD's people, in his temple on earth, to pa&s;s to join the haters of the LORD, in cur&s;ing and bla&s;phe|ming his name in regions of de&s;pair for ever and ever! &mdash;An awful thought!&mdash; may it be deeply impre&s;&s;|ed on every heart!&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT are we &s;incere, in our devotion to GOD, and in prai&s;ing his name; then may we hope from prai&s;ing him imperfectly on earth, to pa&s;s to &s;ing in perfection above: and with angels, and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, and with the whole multitude of the redeemed of the LORD, to a&s;cribe prai&s;e, and ble&s;&s;ing, and honor, and glory, and power, to him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and unto the lamb, forever and ever. Which GOD, of his infinite mercy grant, for his mercy's &s;ake, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
