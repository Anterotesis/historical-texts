<HEAD>The PRINTER to the READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Manu&s;cript Copy of this Tran&s;lation of <HI>Cato's Moral Di&s;tichs,</HI> happened into my Hands &s;ome Time &s;ince, and being my &s;elf extreamly plea&s;ed with it, I thought it might be no le&s;s acceptable to the Publick; and there|fore determined to print it as &s;oon as I &s;hould have conve|nient Lei&s;ure and Opportunity. It was done by a Gentle|man among&s;t us (who&s;e Name or Character I am &s;trictly forbid to mention, tho' it might give &s;ome Advantage to my Edition) for the U&s;e of his own Children; But in my Opinion, it is no unfit or unprofitable Entertainment for tho&s;e of riper Years. For certainly, &s;uch excellent Pre|cepts of Morality, contain'd in &s;uch &s;hort and ea&s;ily-remem|ber'd Sentences, may to Youth particularly be very &s;ervice|able in the Conduct of Life, &s;ince there can &s;carce happen any Affair of Importance to us, in which we may need Ad|vice, but one or more of the&s;e Di&s;tichs &s;uited to the Occa|&s;ion,

<P>When I obtained Leave to make this Publication, I pro|cured al&s;o the following Account of the Author and his Work: for I thought &s;omething of the kind nece&s;&s;ary to be prefix'd to it.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t Places that I am acquainted with, &s;o great is the pre&s;ent Corruption of Manners, that a Printer &s;hall find much more Profit in &s;uch Things as flatter and encou|rage Vice, than in &s;uch as tend to promote its contrary. It would be thought a Piece of Hypocri&s;y and phari&s;aical O&s;tentation in me, if I &s;hould &s;ay, that I print the&s;e <HI>Di&s;|tichs</HI> more with a View to the Good of others than my own private Advantage: And indeed I cannot &s;ay it; for I con|fe&s;s, I have &s;o great Confidence in the common Virtue and Good Sen&s;e of the People of this and the neighbouring Pro|vinces, that I expect to &s;ell a very good Impre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>Some ACCOUNT of the fol|lowing Piece, and Conjectures concerning its AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<P>THO' the Original of the&s;e Moral Di&s;tichs, by being put into the Hands of Boys of the lower Forms at the Latin School, have been frequently con&s;idered as an Entertainment &s;uitable only to &s;uch childi&s;h Years; yet great and able Judges have conceived a much more honourable E&s;teem of them. They have been commented on by divers Authors, but particularly by <HI>Era&s;mus:</HI> They were tran&s;lated into Greek by <HI>Maximus Planudes,</HI> a native of <HI>Greece,</HI> and one of the mo&s;t learned of his Age. But the great <HI>Jo&s;eph Scaliger,</HI> di&s;&s;atisfyed with that Performance, gave another mo&s;t elegant Ver&s;ion of them into the &s;ame Language, which has been divers times printed. And tho' a Critic in that Tongue, on viewing the Ver&s;ion, would not ea&s;ily be induced to believe it could be better'd, yet it has been twice &s;ince attempted by two other &s;everal Hands, mentioned by <HI>Fabricius.</HI> So that at lea&s;t four Greek Tran&s;lations of them have appeared. Into the European Languages, as French, Italian, Dutch, there have been many Tran&s;lations, and into each of them by &s;everal Hands. They have al&s;o been divers Times render'd into our own; but the Author of this never &s;aw any of them, that by <HI>Charles Hoole,</HI> made in plain and low Lan|guage for the U&s;e of School-boys, only excepted; and therefore he knows not but they may have been much better done before: But as he intended them (as th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> are here fini&s;hed) &s;olely for the U&s;e of his own Children, with &s;ome of their Acquaintance, and never for publick View, he is no way &s;olicitous what others may have perform'd, provided the&s;e as they are, will an&s;wer the End they were intended for. Tho&s;e who find Fault with them may try to do better on any Score of them together, and then they will be more capable of judging, whether it is a very ea&s;y Task throughout the
<PB N="vi" REF="003884_0005_10020DA14743AA38">whole, to comprize the Sen&s;e of two Latin Hexameters in twenty Syllables in Engli&s;h, with a &s;mooth Cadence, and tagg'd with a &s;trong Rhime.</P>
<P>Of the Author of the&s;e <HI>Di&s;tichs</HI> there have been various Sentiments; they are call'd <HI>Cato's,</HI> but they could neither be the Work of the Cen&s;or, the elder of that Name, nor of the much greater Man the younger, call'd <HI>Uticen&s;is</HI> from the Place of his Death: For in the&s;e Ver&s;es, <HI>Virgil, Macer, Ovid,</HI> and <HI>Lucan,</HI> are mention'd, none of whom wrote till after the Death of both the&s;e <HI>Cato's.</HI> The fir&s;t of the Antients who&s;e Works remain, that appears to have known them, is one <HI>Vindicianus</HI> a Phy&s;ician, who in a Letter to the Emperor <HI>Valentinian</HI> the elder, about the Year 370, quotes one of the&s;e Lines: And in a Glo&s;&s;ary printed at the end of the <HI>Autores L. Latinae,</HI> &s;aid to be <HI>I&s;idore</HI>'s, who died about the Year 630, the uncommon Word <HI>Officipedi</HI> is found, and <HI>Cato</HI> is expre&s;sly quoted for it as an Author; which Word [in another Declen&s;ion] is met with in the 4th Book, Numb. 42 of the&s;e Di&s;tichs</P>
<P>Some have thought him a later Chri&s;tian Writer; but for the Rea&s;ons given he could not be late, nor could he be a Chri&s;tian; for no Chri&s;tian would have been Author of that Di&s;tich, <HI>Lib.</HI> 4. <HI>Numb.</HI> 14.</P>
<Q><L>Cum &s;is ip&s;e nocens moritur cur Victima pro te?</L>
<L><HI>Stultitia e&s;t morte alterius &s;perare Salutem.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Since this is directly repugnant to the main Fundamental of the Chri&s;|tian Religion. <HI>Scaliger's</HI> Opinion, upon a due Con&s;ideration of the Stile (which is allow'd by all but <HI>Boxhornius</HI> to be correct and pure) and of all other Circum&s;tances, &s;eems to be the mo&s;t ju&s;t; which is, that he was an unconverted Gentile, and lived about the Times of <HI>Commodus</HI> or <HI>Severus;</HI> that is, towards the beginning of the third Century: To which may be added, that 'tis probable he might be inclin'd to the Doctrine of the <HI>Py|thagoreans</HI> and <HI>Platoni&s;ts,</HI> which was revived and came much into Repute a|bout that Time. But whoever the Author was, notwith&s;tanding they have a Fault very common with mo&s;t of the Ancients, that is, that there is &s;carce any Order in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> divers Repetitions, as al&s;o that &s;ometimes the Thought is either low or ob&s;cure, (which 'tis hoped is &s;omewhat mended in the pre&s;ent Ver&s;ion) yet they have been very ju&s;tly e&s;teemed in all Ages pa&s;t, &s;ince they were known; and in tho&s;e to come may con|tinue ju&s;tly to de&s;erve the &s;ame.</P>
