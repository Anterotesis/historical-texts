<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the Study of <HI>Ethics</HI> makes &s;o great a Part of an academical Education, and there are Profe&s;&s;ors of that Science in mo&s;t of the Univer&s;ities in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> I have, for many Years pa&s;t, been in Que&s;t of &s;ome Sy&s;tem of that Kind, proper to be recited by the Students; but can find none well adapted to that Purpo&s;e. For though there are many Treati&s;es which contain good Rules of external Conduct, yet the Obligation to act according to tho&s;e Rules, is not ju&s;tly &s;tated; and &s;everal in&s;ufficient and fal&s;e Foundations are laid down by Authors of con&s;iderable Note.</P>
<P>It &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary that the Students &s;hould fir&s;t be well in&s;tructed in the true Nature of <HI>moral Virtue,</HI> and the Foundation of our <HI>Obligations</HI> to practi&s;e it, before they read the practical Rules which are formed thereupon.</P>
<P>As this Treati&s;e was de&s;igned, principally, for the U&s;e of the Students of this College, I have, to &s;ave the Charge of Printing, wrote in as conci&s;e
<PB N="ii" REF="009931_0003_0F7B3B8656D26840">
a Manner, as can be intelligible, on &s;uch a cri|tical and metaphy&s;ical Subject. If any Expre&s;&s;ions &s;hould &s;eem doubtful, I may be pre&s;ent to explain and enlarge upon them: And if this &s;hould happen to fall into the Hands of any Gentleman at a Di&s;tance, who &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that any Expre&s;&s;ion is capable of &s;uch a Con&s;truction, as is not con&s;i&s;tent with Truth, I would a&s;k the Favour of an Opportunity to explain my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In treating upon the divine Ideas, I have ge|nerally follow'd the Sentiments and Expre&s;&s;ions in <HI>Norris's Ideal World.</HI></P>
<P>As this Treati&s;e contains only &s;hort Hints or Heads to be paraphras'd upon, but few Copies are printed at pre&s;ent; propo&s;ing that if God &s;hould &s;pare my Life, and give me &s;ome Relaxation from my pre&s;ent Multiplicity of Bu&s;ine&s;s, to publi&s;h a more full and complete Treati&s;e upon this Subject, which I look upon to be of great Importance, be|cau&s;e it contains the moral Part of all <HI>true Reli|gion,</HI> which is the Foundation of the Whole: Tho' no fallen Creature can become <HI>truly virtuous,</HI> but in Con&s;equence of an Atonement, and the renovating Influences of the divine Spirit: And I &s;uppo&s;e that Men generally form their Sentiments of the peculiar Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, according to &s;ome few <HI>moral Principles,</HI> which they <HI>at fir&s;t</HI> &s;et out upon, relating to the Holine&s;s and Strictne&s;s of the divine Law, and the Nature of <HI>moral Obligation.</HI></P>

<P N="1">&sect; 1. _AS Ethics or Moral Philo&s;o|phy, makes a con&s;iderable Part of an academical Edu|cation, and is nearly con|nected with true Religion, it is of great Importance that it &s;hould be <HI>clearly &s;tated,</HI> and fixed upon the right <HI>Foundation.</HI> &mdash; Authors are generally agreed in the Rules of external Conduct, for the general Good of Communities and particular Per&s;ons; but differ greatly in the <HI>Foundation</HI> of the <HI>Obligation</HI> to ob&s;erve tho&s;e Rules, and in the <HI>Criterion of moral Good and Evil.</HI> Mo&s;t Authors have treated up|on <HI>Ethics</HI> as a Sy&s;tem of <HI>moral Rules</HI> of Conduct, &s;ummarily comprehended in the ten Command|ments; and as the moral Part of practical Re|ligion: But then the &s;eparating of this from the Doctrines or Principles of Religion, upon which it is founded, has been the Occa&s;ion of &s;everal
<PB N="2" REF="009931_0005_0F7B3B89EAD1F1D0">
Mi&s;takes; and particularly this, that many have treated <HI>Ethics</HI> only as the Laws of Nature and Nations, or a Sy&s;tem of <HI>civil Laws,</HI> generally obtaining among Mankind, and calculated prin|cipally to promote the temporal Good of public Communities and particular Per&s;ons, in their enjoying the natural Plea&s;ures and Happine&s;s of the pre&s;ent Life. Others have, as it were, part|ly blended both the&s;e together, and from thence have formed a Sy&s;tem of what they call the <HI>Re|ligion of Nature,</HI> whereby every Man may ob|tain the Favour of God and eternal Happine&s;s, by his own Powers, without a Mediator or any divine Revelation. <HI>Ethics,</HI> in this View, have very much paved the Way to Dei&s;m; and therefore have been ju&s;tly oppo&s;ed by many good Men.<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Dr. C. MATHER (in his <HI>Introductio ad Mini&s;terium</HI>) calls it <HI>Impietas in Artis Formam redacta.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. And as Men have had very different Views of the ultimate End and De&s;ign of <HI>Ethics;</HI> &s;o they have &s;et out upon very different <HI>Grounds</HI> and <HI>Foundations,</HI> to build their &s;everal Sy&s;tems upon: Some upon the Foundation of <HI>Self-Intere&s;t</HI> and Happine&s;s; &s;ome upon univer|&s;al <HI>Benevolence,</HI> and &s;ome upon <HI>moral Ta&s;te;</HI> and others upon various other fir&s;t Principles, which are either fal&s;e, or but con&s;equential Appendages to the true Foundation. To rectify the&s;e Mi&s;|takes, and to &s;ettle the Nature of <HI>moral Virtue and Obligation</HI> upon its ju&s;t and true Foundation, is the De&s;ign of the pre&s;ent E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="3" REF="009931_0006_0F7B3B8AA2B6BBE8">&sect; 3. And, therefore,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall con&s;ider the Nature and Standard of moral Virtue.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Obligation, which every moral Agent is under, to be conformed to that Standard.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Way whereby we may come to the Knowledge of that Standard, and of &s;uch a Temper and Conduct as is a Conformity to it.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> I &s;hall exhibit a brief and general Scheme of moral Virtues and Duties.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall con&s;ider the Nature and Stan|dard of moral Virtue.</P>
<P><HI>Moral Virtue</HI> is a Conformity to the <HI>moral Perfections of God;</HI> or it is an Imitation of God, in the moral Perfections of his Nature, &s;o far as they are imitable by his Creatures. And the moral Perfections of God are the <HI>&s;ole</HI> Foundation and Standard of all that Virtue, Goodne&s;s and Perfection which can exi&s;t in the Creature.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. For God is a being infinitely and ab&s;o|lutely perfect. He has all tho&s;e Perfections which are contained or implied in the Words <HI>good, right, excellent, amiable,</HI> and all other Words of the like Import&mdash;all tho&s;e Perfections which can po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t, or that can be con|ceived of by the mo&s;t perfect Intelligent: For there can be no Limitation of Perfection in a nece&s;&s;ary and <HI>&s;elf-exi&s;tent</HI> Being.</P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. Indeed we get the Idea of a Perfection from tho&s;e &s;mall Degrees of Perfection which we ob&s;erve in the Creatures, and then we a&s;|cribe all Perfections to God, in an infinite De|gree;
<PB N="4" REF="009931_0007_0F7B3B8ACEAE4918">
and unite them all in the Idea of ONE ALL-PERFECT BEING.</P>
<P N="6">&sect; 6. So that, in the Order of our Conceptions, we conceive of a Perfection as exi&s;ting in the Creature, <HI>before</HI> we conceive of it as exi&s;ting in God, and generally (it may be) before we have any Idea of God at all. And therefore we are apt to conceive (or, at lea&s;t, to u&s;e &s;ome Ex|pre&s;&s;ions as if we did conceive) &s;ome Perfections to have an independent Exi&s;tence <HI>out of</HI> God, and <HI>prior</HI> to him; and as if we would <HI>try</HI> him by that Standard, and approve of his Qualities according as we conceived them to be agreeable to it. But this is a great Mi&s;take: For all Perfection is originally in God, as the <HI>primary</HI> Foundation and Standard, and from that Foun|tain is communicated to the Creatures, in vari|ous limited Degrees, according to their &s;everal Ranks and Orders.</P>
<P N="7">&sect; 7. As his Being includes and comprehends all Perfection; &s;o no Perfection can po&s;&s;ibly ex|i&s;t in the Creature, or be conceived by him, but what fir&s;t exi&s;ted in the Creator: Neither can it have any innate Excellency or permanent Ex|i&s;tence, but only &s;o far as it re&s;embles Some|thing in God, and is dependent upon him. The Perfection of the Creature con&s;i&s;ts in his <HI>Re&s;emblance</HI> or <HI>Conformity</HI> to God; but the Per|fection of God con&s;i&s;ts in his being <HI>what he is,</HI> or like to <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> as the primary Standard; without any antecedent or concomitant Rule or Standard to mea&s;ure him&s;elf by.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="5" REF="009931_0008_0F7B3B8B86B59720">&sect; 8. <HI>Self-Exi&s;tence</HI> or nece&s;&s;ary Exi&s;tence, without any antecedent Cau&s;e or Foundation, is the fir&s;t <HI>fundamental</HI> Perfection we conceive of in God; and from <HI>that</HI> all other Perfections nece&s;&s;arily <HI>re&s;ult;</HI> &s;uch as Eternity, Immutabi|lity, Omnipre&s;ence, Omni&s;cience, Omnipotence, Wi&s;dom, &amp;c. Indeed, all Perfection in God is, in &s;ome Re&s;pect, <HI>one;</HI> that is, all Perfection is, in him, <HI>one</HI> &s;imple, uncompounded, uniform Thing: But our Minds are not capacious enough to form &s;uch a comprehen&s;ive, clear Idea; and therefore we mu&s;t conceive of each particular Perfection, <HI>di&s;tinctly</HI> by it&s;elf, or our Ideas of them will be confu&s;ed.</P>
<P N="9">&sect; 9. We u&s;ually conceive of the divine Per|fections under two general Heads:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Natural Perfections;</HI> &s;uch as Eternity, Immutability, Omni&s;cience, Omnipotency, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Moral Perfections;</HI> &s;uch as Holine&s;s, Ju&s;|tice, Goodne&s;s and Truth; which are called the <HI>moral Rectitude</HI> of the divine Nature.</P>
<P><HI>Natural</HI> Perfections, &s;uch as Knowledge, Power, &amp;c. may exi&s;t, in a great Degree, in a Being utterly de&s;titute of <HI>moral</HI> Goodne&s;s or Holine&s;s; and be perverted to the wor&s;t Ends and Purpo&s;es, as they are in the Devils. But <HI>moral</HI> Perfections, &s;uch as Ju&s;tice, Goodne&s;s, and Truth, have an <HI>immutable</HI> Excellency and Amiablene&s;s in them, and cannot be directly perverted, without de&s;troying their very <HI>Nature.</HI> There is indeed a nece&s;&s;ary Connection between the natural and moral Perfections of God; for
<PB N="6" REF="009931_0009_0F7B3B8C44CD08D0">
Ju&s;tice, Goodne&s;s and Truth pre&s;uppo&s;e &s;ome Degree of Knowledge and Power by which they are exerci&s;ed; and Knowledge and Power mu&s;t be regulated by Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s, or other|wi&s;e they lo&s;e the Excellency of their Nature, and are to be dreaded rather than loved.</P>
<P N="10">&sect; 10. When God makes a <HI>Creature,</HI> he com|municates to him &s;ome Degree of his own Per|fections, though, being limited, they cannot exi&s;t in the &s;ame Form and Manner, but under different Circum&s;tances from what they are in the Creator. The&s;e <HI>different</HI> Degrees of Per|fection, thus communicated, con&s;titute the <HI>dif|ferent Ranks</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> of the Creatures. To the Inanimates he communicates but little more than bare Exi&s;tence. On the Vegetables he im|pre&s;&s;es a uniform Motion of the nutritive Parts, with a proper Cohe&s;ion. To Animals he com|municates an animal Motion and Life, with an In&s;tinct to pre&s;erve their Lives and continue their Species, in which they di&s;cover a Sagacity very nearly re&s;embling Rea&s;on. To <HI>Man</HI> he has communicated the &s;uperior Powers of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and Under&s;tanding, whereby he is capable of forming &s;ome Ideas of the natural and moral Perfections of God and his Works; of compar|ing the Ideas of Things, and of drawing ju&s;t Inferences and Deductions.</P>
<P N="11">&sect; 11. When any Creature is endued with &s;uch a Degree of Under&s;tanding and <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> as to be capable of conceiving of the <HI>natural</HI> Re|lations of Things, and &s;o of the <HI>natural</HI> Perfec|tions
<PB N="7" REF="009931_0010_0F7B3B8D66B10B68">
of God; and is al&s;o, <HI>in &s;ome Mea&s;ure,</HI> capable of under&s;tanding the Nature of Right and Wrong, or the <HI>moral</HI> Relations of Things, as compared with a <HI>Rule</HI> of right Conduct, and &s;o of the <HI>moral</HI> Perfections of God; &s;uch a Be|ing is called a MORAL AGENT and is capable of <HI>moral Virtue,</HI> and is the Subject of <HI>moral Go|vernment and Obligation.</HI> The <HI>moral Virtue,</HI> Goodne&s;s or Excellency of &s;uch a <HI>moral Agent,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in a <HI>Conformity</HI> to the <HI>moral Perfections of God,</HI> as the original Standard of all Perfection.</P>
<P N="12">&sect; 12. This Conformity is twofold; either internal and real, or only external and apparent.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Internal or real Virtue</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in an inward Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind, which is <HI>like to God</HI> and conformable to the moral Perfections of his Nature; &s;uch as Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice, Good|ne&s;s and Truth. And this internal, <HI>divine Prin|ciple</HI> will naturally produce a Cour&s;e of <HI>external Actions</HI> conformable to it, as the natural Effect and Expre&s;&s;ion of it. And the <HI>ultimate</HI> End and De&s;ign of a Per&s;on endued with this Principle, will be to act in Conformity to the <HI>divine Per|fections,</HI> and to do all to the <HI>Glory of God.</HI></P>
<P N="13">&sect; 13. (2.) <HI>External or apparent Virtue</HI> is &s;uch an external Conduct as may &s;eem to be the vi|&s;ible Effect or Expre&s;&s;ion of this inward divine Principle; but, in Reality, is not; and proceeds from &s;ome <HI>lower</HI> Motive, &s;uch as Self-Intere&s;t, Honour, Fancy, or the like. Thus a Man may devote a con&s;iderable Part of his E&s;tate to pub|lick U&s;es civil and &s;acred, may be ju&s;t and bene|ficent
<PB N="8" REF="009931_0011_0F7B3B8DD794E938">
to his Neighbour, punctual to his Promi|&s;es, and ab&s;tain from all bodily Exce&s;&s;es; and yet, in all the&s;e Things, have no Regard to <HI>God,</HI> but only to <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> to his own Intere&s;t, Reputation or Fancy. Although the Matter of the&s;e Actions is ju&s;t and right, and agreeable to the <HI>divine Law;</HI> yet, as they do not proceed from a true <HI>Principle</HI> and right End, they are not really <HI>virtuous,</HI> nor &s;o accounted by the Searcher of Hearts. Indeed the Heathen, who had no higher Principle, generally accounted &s;uch Actions to be <HI>virtuous;</HI> but <HI>divine Revela|tion</HI> teaches us, that there can be no virtuous Actions without a divine Temper of Mind, in Conformity to the <HI>Perfections of God.</HI> <NOTE N="[x]" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>2 Pet. 1.3.</HI> Add to your Faith Virtue. <HI>Eph. 4.24. Col. 3.10.</HI>&mdash;Virtutes appellames &s;anctos Affectus &s;anctas Cogitationes et Actiones.</P>

<P N="14">&sect; 14. Having con&s;idered the true Nature and original Standard of moral Virtue, I proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To con&s;ider the <HI>Obligation</HI> which every rational Creature and moral Agent is un|der, to be conformed to the <HI>moral Perfections of God.</HI> This <HI>Obligation</HI> ari&s;es,</P>
<P N="1">I. And principally, from the <HI>infinite and ab|&s;olute Perfection</HI> of the divine Nature: For as
<PB N="9" REF="009931_0012_0F7B3B8EFB1657C0">
God is the mo&s;t perfect Being, &s;o the mo&s;t <HI>per|fect State</HI> of any other Being, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in being <HI>like to him.</HI> As he is the only <HI>&s;elf-exi&s;tent</HI> Being, the original Standard of all Perfection, and all Creatures derive their &s;everal Degrees of Perfection from <HI>him,</HI> he mu&s;t be the <HI>only Rule</HI> and Pattern for <HI>them;</HI> and their highe&s;t Perfec|tion mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in being <HI>like to</HI> the original and <HI>all-perfect</HI> Standard. The <HI>greater</HI> Degree of divine Perfection any Creature enjoys, the <HI>more</HI> perfect he mu&s;t be.</P>
<P N="15">&sect; 15. Every Creature of God was originally made perfect, <HI>in his own Model</HI> or <HI>Degree;</HI> that is, its Degree of Perfection was uniform, &s;o as to have no Part or Quality deficient, incongruous or repugnant to any other Part; or to have any two Di&s;po&s;itions or Qualities, which, in their own Nature, or under any Circum&s;tances, could operate <HI>contrary</HI> to each other. The Perfection, therefore, of a rational Creature, mu&s;t be to <HI>continue</HI> in that <HI>perfect</HI> State in which he was created: But to <HI>lo&s;e</HI> any Part of it, or to acquire any <HI>contrary</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition or Quality, is a Defec|tion from the mo&s;t <HI>perfect Pattern and Standard,</HI> and a De&s;truction of the Works of God. This, in Scripture is called ANOMIA, a Deviation from the perfect Law of <HI>moral Rectitude,</HI> foun|ded in the <HI>divine Nature.</HI> It is al&s;o called <HI>mo|ral Depravity</HI> or <HI>Sin,</HI> and as it is the fir&s;t Prin|ciple of wrong Action, it is called <HI>Original Sin.</HI></P>
<P N="16">&sect; 16. And if a Creature has deviated from this Standard of Perfection, <HI>heretofore;</HI> that will
<PB N="10" REF="009931_0013_0F7B3B8F7511EC18">
not ju&s;tify his Deviation from it, for the <HI>Time to come.</HI> For it will remain an eternal and immu|table TRUTH, re&s;ulting from the Nature of God and the Relation of a rational Creature to him, that <HI>his</HI> Perfection con&s;i&s;ts in a Conformity to the Perfection of <HI>God;</HI> and that notwith&s;tan|ding his former Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion or Defect has brought upon him a pre&s;ent Indi&s;po&s;ition, Un|willingne&s;s or <HI>Incapacity</HI> of &s;uch a perfect Con|formity: For &s;uch an Indi&s;po&s;ition or Incapacity is &s;o far from being a Ju&s;tification of his pre&s;ent State, or an Evidence of his being &s;till in a State of Perfection, that, on the contrary, it is yet a further Deviation from the mo&s;t perfect Stan|dard; for a rational Creature's Indi&s;po&s;ition or Incapacity of being like to God, renders him the more unlike to him.</P>
<P N="17">&sect; 17. Indeed all the Works of God, as they come from him, are perfect; and every Part of them congruous and con&s;i&s;tent with each other; &s;o that whenever he makes a <HI>moral Agent,</HI> he endues him with a perfect Di&s;po&s;ition and full <HI>Powers</HI> to do his Duty, and be <HI>perfect,</HI> as &s;uch a Creature: But if he afterwards, by any Means, contracts a contrary Di&s;po&s;ition, or lo&s;es his <HI>Power, that</HI> no ways alters the Nature of his <HI>Perfection,</HI> or the Nature of his <HI>Obligation.</HI> The Perfection of the Creature con&s;i&s;ts in a Conformity to God, <HI>after</HI> he has indi&s;po&s;ed or incapacitated him&s;elf for it, as much as it did <HI>before.</HI> Notwith&s;tan&s;ting all he can do, the &s;ame Truth will <HI>eternally</HI> remain, that <HI>his highe&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="009931_0014_0F7B3B9000FA84D0">
Perfection con&s;i&s;ts in a Conformity to God;</HI> and it is impo&s;&s;ible that any Action of his &s;hould <HI>annul</HI> or make it void.</P>
<P N="18">&sect; 18. It is al&s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine Perfections to &s;uppo&s;e that God &s;hould <HI>relea&s;e</HI> or <HI>di&s;charge</HI> any moral Agent from his Obliga|tion to a perfect Conformity to the divine Per|fections; or that he &s;hould <HI>&s;ub&s;titute</HI> any other Thing in the Room of it, as that he &s;hould only do his <HI>Endeavour,</HI> or <HI>as well as he can,</HI> or the like. For in every Thing wherein he falls &s;hort of a <HI>perfect Conformity</HI> to God, in the Di&s;po&s;i|tion of his Mind, or Cour&s;e of his Actions (ac|cording to that <HI>Rank</HI> and <HI>Order</HI> in which he is placed among the Creatures) it is his <HI>moral De|fect,</HI> ANOMIA or Sin. And God's Favour and Approbation is nece&s;&s;arily extended to his Crea|tures according to the Degree of their Likene&s;s and Conformity to him.</P>
<P N="19">&sect; 19. Every rational Creature and moral A|gent is <HI>obliged</HI> to be perfect and conformed to God, in the highe&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Sen&s;e in which that Word <HI>Obligation,</HI> is ever u&s;ed. And all tho&s;e Obligations which ari&s;e from Self-Intere&s;t, Hope, Fear, Gratitude, &amp;c. are but <HI>low and faint,</HI> in Compari&s;on of this. Yea, God him|&s;elf is frequently &s;aid (by way of Analogy) to be <HI>obliged</HI> to act according to his own Perfec|tions: But this Obligation, in a more <HI>direct</HI> and <HI>primary Sen&s;e,</HI> is &s;aid to be incumbent upon his Creatures.</P>
<P N="20">&sect; 20. II. This Obligation ari&s;es, in a &s;econ|dary

<P N="25">&sect; 25. Now I concede that God has implant|ed a Principle of <HI>Self-Love</HI> and Self-Pre&s;erva|tion in all Animals: and that all Brutes and the greater Part of Mankind are in <HI>fact</HI> govern'd by that <HI>alone.</HI> And it is an In&s;tance of the Wi&s;|dom of God in his providential Government of the World, that, &s;ince the greater Part of Man|kind, in this fallen State, are de&s;titute of any higher or better Principle, he has implanted <HI>this,</HI> which keeps the World in &s;ome good Order and Regulation. Men are generally agreed, that <HI>Lying, Stealing, Robbery, Piracy,</HI> &amp;c. are <HI>bad;</HI> and they &s;eem generally to hate them; not from a Sen&s;e of the real MORAL EVIL of the&s;e Things in <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> or their Contrariety to the holy <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> of God; but as being contrary to the <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> of the Community, and of <HI>our&s;elves.</HI> And therefore whenever we hear that any &s;uch Acts are done, every one im|mediately has this Reflection, "It may be <HI>my</HI> Turn to be robbed next, and I wi&s;h the Actor was puni&s;hed, in order to prevent it." I al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e that a meer <HI>natural Man,</HI> in no Degree illuminated by the Divine Spirit, cannot in any <HI>human Way,</HI> be convinced of any <HI>moral Evil</HI> in Sin, but only by the natural ill Con&s;equences

which attend it. Since therefore this Principle of Self-Love is implanted by God, and an&s;wers many good Ends, it is not to be eradicated; but regulated by, and made &s;ub&s;ervient to a Princi|ple which is infinitely higher and better, viz. a Conformity to the moral Perfections of God; which is the <HI>Standard</HI> of the highe&s;t Perfection of human Nature.</P>

In Pur&s;uance therefore to this Princi|ple of Self-Love and Happine&s;s, a Man may thus rea&s;on with him&s;elf, <Q>I am one of the Creatures of God, placed in a certain Rank and Dignity in the Creation, and put into a Capacity of Happine&s;s, under certain Re|&s;trictions and Limitations: I will therefore endeavour to promote my own Happine&s;s, in Obedience to the Will of God, and princi|pally that the Glory of his Goodne&s;s, Mercy and Wi&s;dom might be di&s;played in it. And as God has committed the Care of <HI>my&s;elf</HI> more immediately to <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> I, con&s;idering my&s;elf as his Servant e&s;pecially appointed to this Bu&s;ine&s;s, will, in Obedience to his Com|mands, take e&s;pecial Care to glorify him in this Way.</Q></P>

<P><PB N="56" REF="009931_0059_0F7B3BB7C1ED5110"><HI>La&s;t Place,</HI> exhibit a brief and general Scheme of moral Virtues and Duties;</P>
<P N="1">I. To God. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. To <HI>love</HI> him. Love is a plea&s;ing Appro|bation of any Object; or &s;uch an Approbation of an Object, as is accompanied with Plea&s;ure. And this ari&s;es both from the <HI>Amiablene&s;s</HI> of the Object in it&s;elf; and from a <HI>&s;imilar</HI> Di&s;po|&s;ition of Mind; whereby a Per&s;on is di&s;po&s;ed to approve of, to be plea&s;ed with, and delighted in &s;uch an Object. And as God is the mo&s;t perfect, amiable and excellent Being, we ought to love him with all our Hearts and Souls; and other Beings only &s;o far as they bear a Re&s;em|blance to him, or for his Sake.</P>
<P N="2">2. To <HI>fear</HI> him. A Principle of A&s;&s;imila|tion to God nece&s;&s;arily produces a <HI>Fear</HI> of doing any Thing which may gain his <HI>Di&s;plea&s;ure</HI> or Di&s;approbation; for this nece&s;&s;arily implies &s;ome Contrariety or Di&s;&s;imilitude.</P>
<P N="3">3. To <HI>tru&s;t</HI> in him and depend upon him, in the Way of our Duty. This nece&s;&s;arily flows from a realizing View of the divine Perfections; e&s;pecially Wi&s;dom, Power, and Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. To <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> him. An <HI>internal</HI> Sen&s;e and Approbation of the divine Perfections, will ne|ce&s;&s;arily exert and expre&s;s it&s;elf in <HI>external</HI> Words and Actions; which al&s;o have a Ten|dency to &s;trengthen and increa&s;e the Sen&s;e and Habit of our own Minds, and to produce the &s;ame Di&s;po&s;ition in the Minds of others.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="57" REF="009931_0060_0F7B3BB9D65D99E8">5. To <HI>repent</HI> of Sin. A Mind which is, in the main, conformed to the moral Perfections of God, will nece&s;&s;arily be di&s;plea&s;ed with and hate every Thing which is contrary thereunto; which will always be accompanied with a Grief and Sorrow; e&s;pecially as the Fault is within him&s;elf.</P>
<P>From this &s;ame Principle, all other Duties to God may, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine Revelation, be ea&s;ily deduced.</P>
<P N="68">&sect; 68. II. Tho&s;e Duties which more imme|diately re&s;pect our <HI>Neighbours</HI> or Mankind in general. The &s;ame divine Principle will di&s;po&s;e us to view <HI>all Mankind</HI> as the Creatures of God, originally made in his Image (and &s;till retaining &s;ome Di&s;po&s;itions which may in &s;ome Re&s;pects be called good) as Fellow-Subjects to the &s;ame King, as Fellow-Servants of the &s;ame Lord; and treat them according to the Rules of Ju&s;tice, Goodne&s;s and Truth. Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. We &s;hould <HI>love</HI> them. That is we &s;hould approve of and take Delight in what is good in them; as it bears a Re&s;emblance to &s;ome of the divine Perfections. We ought indeed to <HI>hate</HI> their bad Di&s;po&s;itions and Actions, but not their Per&s;ons: e&s;pecially &s;ince we don't know, but that they may yet be the Objects of God's eternal Favour: We ought, at lea&s;t, to love them with a <HI>Love of Benevolence:</HI> and endea|vour to promote their temporal and eternal Hap|pine&s;s; &s;o far as is con&s;i&s;tent with other Duties.
<PB N="58" REF="009931_0061_0F7B3BBA95F5A888">
And that from a Principle of Obedience to God who has commanded us <HI>to love our Neighbour as our&s;elves</HI> and <HI>to do good to all Men.</HI> And for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e to do &s;o, is to be <HI>like to God</HI> and the Children of our Father which is in Heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. We ought to conduct towards them ac|cording to <HI>Ju&s;tice.</HI> We &s;hould never invade the Right and Property of another: but freely permit him to u&s;e and enjoy what&s;oever is his <HI>own.</HI> And that becau&s;e we hereby act accord|ing to the Nature and Will of the &s;upreme Pro|prietor of all Things; who has commanded us to <HI>render to every one his Due&mdash;to owe no Man any Thing; and not to defraud or go beyond our Neighbour in any Matter.</HI> And that becau&s;e <HI>the righteous Lord loveth Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> and that <HI>to do Ju&s;tice is more acceptable than Sacrifice;</HI> and that <HI>diver&s;e Weights and diver&s;e Mea&s;ures are an Abomination to the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>And as to <HI>punitive</HI> Ju&s;tice, or rendering to every Man that Mi&s;ery or <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> which is his due; &s;o far as any Man is, by the Word or Providence of God, made his Mini&s;ter <HI>to execute Wrath on him that doeth Evil,</HI> he is bound to do it according to the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> of God, and tho&s;e &s;ubordinate Rules which are given him to judge by.</P>
<P N="3">3. We ought to ob&s;erve <HI>Truth</HI> in all our Words and Declarations: &s;o as never de&s;ignedly to <HI>deceive</HI> our Neighbour. For Truth is an e&s;|&s;ential Perfection of God and cannot be infringed

upon by us, without a practical Denial that God is true. Deut. xxxii. 4. <HI>He has &s;tiled him&s;elf the God of Truth;</HI> has commanded us to <HI>&s;peak the Truth.</HI> Ephe&s;. iv. 25. And has declared that he <HI>hates a lying Tongue.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Every Man ought to perform the Duties incumbent upon him as a <HI>Member of Society,</HI> or as re&s;ulting from the various Relations he &s;tands in to others. From divine In&s;titutions and hu|man Compacts, various Relations ari&s;e, &s;uch as, Hu&s;band and Wife, Parents and Children, Ma|gi&s;trates and Subjects, Fellow-Citizens, or Mem|bers of le&s;&s;er Communities having an equal Right with our&s;elves; from which many <HI>Duties</HI> do re&s;ult, according to the Rules of Ju&s;tice, Goodne&s;s and Truth; of which many Authors have treated largely and well: all which are to be ob&s;erved in Conformity to the divine <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Law. Render therefore to every one their Due. Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Ho|nour, Tribute to whom Tribute,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>What&s;oever Things ye would that others &s;hould do unto you, do ye the &s;ame to them.</HI></P>
<P N="69">&sect; 69. III. Tho&s;e Duties which more im|mediately relate to <HI>our&s;elves.</HI> From the &s;ame Principle of Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s, every Man, con&s;idering him&s;elf as <HI>one</HI> of the Creatures of <HI>God;</HI> ought to endeavour to promote <HI>his own</HI> Happine&s;s, as well as the Happine&s;s of <HI>others;</HI> and therefore ought to cultivate and improve his rational Powers and moral Habits; to regulate

the Appetites and Inclinations of his Body, &s;o as to render it the mo&s;t proper Organ of his Soul: and in general to promote his own Perfection and Happine&s;s; &s;o far as is con&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e Duties which more immediately relate to God and his Fellow-Men; acting with a principal View of Conformity to the Perfections and Law of God; and with a &s;ubordinate and additional Stimulous or Incitement of acting according to natural Inclination and Self-Intere&s;t: as a Means appointed by God more fully and effectually to incite him to do that which was his <HI>antecedent</HI> Duty.

For in this <HI>inver&s;e</HI> Method of finding out our Duty, &s;ome Errors have crept into mo&s;t Sy&s;tems of <HI>Ethics;</HI> and one which I apprehend to be very gro&s;s, viz.

The Authors generally go upon this Principle, that the &s;ole Criterion of <HI>moral</HI> Good, is <HI>natural</HI> Good or Happine&s;s. That the Evil of Lying, in any Ca&s;e, does not con&s;i&s;t in <HI>Contradiction to Truth;</HI> but in the <HI>In|jury</HI> it does to others.

However con&s;i&s;tent this Opinion may be with the Principles of the&s;e Authors, or how generally &s;oever it may be received, yet it plain|ly appears to be contrary to the immutable <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Law of God.</HI> And I fully agree with the great Dr. <HI>Ames,</HI> that <Q>the E&s;&s;ence of a Lye con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>de&s;igned Fal&s;hood a&s;&s;erted;</HI> and not barely in the <HI>Injury</HI> which attends it, tho' that is an Aggravation;</Q> and that <Q><HI>every Lye is a Sin,</HI> abominable to God. <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Ame&s;ii Medulla Lib. II. Cap. 21. De Con|&s;cientiae Ca&s;ibus, Lib. V. Cap. 53.</NOTE></Q> Indeed it may be demon&s;trated that this Principle is con|trary to Self-Intere&s;t, taken in a large exten&s;ive Sen&s;e, as including the Intere&s;t which each In|dividual has in the general Good of Mankind, for a long Cour&s;e of Time. For this Opinion and Practice will nece&s;&s;arily de&s;troy all Faith and Confidence among Men: and I <HI>never can believe</HI> a Man, in any Ca&s;e where I can imagine that he can &s;uppo&s;e it will be for his own or his Friend's immediate Intere&s;t to tell a Lye.</P>
<P N="73">&sect; 73. But as every Man will run the Venture of his own Intere&s;t as he plea&s;es; I think we can build upon no certain Foundation in Mora|lity,
<PB N="63" REF="009931_0066_0F7B3BBDC9D68248">
but the <HI>divine Perfections and Law.</HI> Truth is an <HI>eternal, immutable</HI> and <HI>inflexible</HI> Perfection of the divine Nature; and cannot be limited, even in our Conceptions, by any other Perfec|tions: as the Exerci&s;e of the divine Power &s;eems to be limited by Wi&s;dom; but it never can be <HI>wi&s;e</HI> in God to act contrary to his own <HI>Truth.</HI> A Conformity therefore to this Attribute, mu&s;t be <HI>perfect</HI> and without Exception; and no Fault of our own or others, can give us a Di&s;pen&s;a|tion, in <HI>any Ca&s;e</HI> to act contrary to it. The di|vine Law, in this Ca&s;e, is ab&s;olute and without any Limitation. Ephe&s;. iv. 25. <HI>Put away Ly|ing. Speak the Truth every Man to his Neigh|bour.</HI> 1 The&s;. iv. 6. <HI>Let no Man go beyond,</HI> or defraud, <HI>his Neighbour, in</HI> ANY MATTER; <HI>for God is the Avenger of &s;uch.</HI></P>
<P N="74">&sect; 74. As to the In&s;tances of <HI>approved Decep|tion</HI> pretended to be found in <HI>Scripture;</HI> they are all ea&s;ily &s;olved by this one <HI>Di&s;tinction.</HI> There is a plain Di&s;tinction between my a&s;&s;ert|ing a Propo&s;ition which is <HI>fal&s;e;</HI> and my a&s;|&s;erting a Propo&s;ition which is <HI>true,</HI> and another thro' a Mi&s;take, not of my Propo&s;ition, as it is really intended by me, but of &s;ome relative Circum&s;tances, draws a <HI>fal&s;e Inference</HI> from what I &s;aid. In this Ca&s;e he <HI>deceives him&s;elf,</HI> thro' his own Ra&s;hne&s;s and Want of Con&s;idera|tion. And if it be in a Ca&s;e in which I am under no Kind of <HI>Obligation</HI> to tell him the
<PB N="64" REF="009931_0067_0F7B3BBF1EFA2530">
<HI>whole</HI> Truth, or every Truth which has any remote <HI>Relation</HI> to what I &s;aid; then it is no Fault in me, to <HI>let him alone,</HI> to deceive him|&s;elf. And that even though, by knowing his Di&s;po&s;ition, I <HI>expected</HI> before-hand, that he would make &s;uch a <HI>wrong Inference.</HI> But if I was under <HI>any Obligation,</HI> by the divine Law, my own Promi&s;e or otherwi&s;e, to tell him the <HI>whole</HI> Truth in that Matter, and do not; then indeed I am guilty of a <HI>great Fault</HI> by my Neglect: but that alone does not con&s;titute a Lye in the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition. But then my A&s;|&s;ertion mu&s;t be in plain and expre&s;s Words, which being taken according to the <HI>common U&s;e</HI> of Language, or other known <HI>in&s;tituted Signs,</HI> &s;hall <HI>truly</HI> convey my Ideas. For if I u&s;e any Kind of <HI>Equivocations</HI> or mental Re&s;ervations, with a De&s;ign that he &s;hould <HI>mi&s;under&s;tand</HI> me, then I <HI>deceive him,</HI> and that in &s;uch a Manner as is but little, if any Thing better than a <HI>plain Lye.</HI> But if he, from <HI>my Words,</HI> takes up the true Propo&s;ition, as it was contained in <HI>my Mind;</HI> and then incon&s;iderately draws a <HI>fal&s;e Inference</HI> from it, and acts accordingly; he deceives <HI>him|&s;elf</HI> and not <HI>I.</HI></P>
<P N="75">&sect; 75. As &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;ee a <HI>Madman</HI> with a Sword in his Hand, pur&s;uing another, who is at pre&s;ent out of Sight; and I tel him, that four Minutes ago I &s;aw him go into &s;uch a Hou&s;e, and he thereupon &s;uppo&s;es, that he is there <HI>now,</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="009931_0068_0F7B3BBF912A1E88">
and accordingly goes in there to &s;eek him: and I don't tell the Madman that I afterwards &s;aw him come out, and go another Way: this is no <HI>Lye</HI> or <HI>Deception</HI> in me; for I told him the <HI>Truth</HI> and the whole <HI>Truth,</HI> &s;o far as I was obliged or undertook to do it: and what followed was his <HI>mi&s;taken Inference</HI> from the <HI>Truth</HI> which I told him. Indeed if he had a&s;ked me if I be|lieved that he was there <HI>now,</HI> and I had an&s;wered <HI>Yes,</HI> I &s;hould have been guilty of <HI>Lying.</HI> But then I might have refu&s;ed to give him any An&s;|wer at all, without any Violation of Truth.</P>
<P N="76">&sect; 76. So in <HI>Stratagems in War:</HI> if I retreat or flee before my Enemy; and from this Action he infers that I am beat, di&s;couraged, or will <HI>fight no more:</HI> and &s;o pur&s;ues me with Precipi|tation, and gives me an Advantage again&s;t him; and then I turn back and take it, as I before <HI>de|&s;igned,</HI> I am guilty of <HI>no Lye</HI> or active <HI>Deception:</HI> I only let him alone to <HI>deceive him&s;elf,</HI> by not revealing to him a Truth which I was under no Obligation to di&s;cover. But if I &s;trike my Colours, hold up a Flag of Truce, or u&s;e any other known, <HI>in&s;tituted</HI> Sign of Submi&s;&s;ion or Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms; and he thereupon comes to me unarmed; and I fall upon him and kill him; I am guilty of perfidious <HI>Lying</HI> and <HI>Murder;</HI> becau&s;e I acted contrary to my <HI>own</HI> Declaration.</P>
<P N="77">&sect; 77. This Di&s;tinction and Rule is plain: all the Danger in the Application of it will be this;
<PB N="66" REF="009931_0069_0F7B3BC028BFDE98">
&mdash; a Man, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, may think him&s;elf <HI>not oblig'd</HI> to di&s;cover a Truth, when he really is obliged, from the Principles of Ju&s;tice, Truth or Goodne&s;s. But a preci&s;e Determination of the Boundaries of Obligation, in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, would require con&s;iderable Time, and does not belong to the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion. Upon the whole therefore it appears, that a Man ought not, in ANY Ca&s;e, or under any Circum&s;tances what&s;oever, knowingly to <HI>declare</HI> or <HI>a&s;&s;ert</HI> any Propo&s;ition or Thing which is a <HI>Lye, fal&s;e</HI> or <HI>untrue:</HI> and if he does, he contradicts and im|plicitly denies the <HI>Truth</HI> and Law of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Things, duly con&s;idered, will be &s;uf|ficient to direct us how to di&s;tingui&s;h between the <HI>ju&s;tifiable</HI> and <HI>unju&s;tifiable</HI> In&s;tances of <HI>&s;eem|ing or &s;uppo&s;ed Deception,</HI> recorded in the &s;acred Scripture.</P>
