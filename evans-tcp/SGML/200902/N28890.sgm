<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>As the writer of the following narrative (being per&s;onally known to and well e&s;teem|ed by a number among us,) was enabled to bear a faithful and upright te&s;timony to the peaceable government of Chri&s;t, and again&s;t the &s;pirit of war, we think the Publication of it may afford &s;trength and encouragement to others to follow his worthy example; we therefore recommend its peru&s;al to the members of our religious &s;ociety and others, hoping it may have a tendency to advance our peaceable te&s;timony.</P>

<HEAD>A NARRATIVE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE FOLLOWING NARRATIVE WAS TAKEN FROM A MANU|SCRIPT LEFT BY OUR FRIEND JOHN SMITH, WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN THE EARLY PART OF HIS LIFE, IN ORDER TO PRESERVE SOME ACCOUNT OF HIS EXPERIENCES, TRIALS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I JOHN SMITH of Marlborough in Che&s;|ter County Penn&s;ylvania, was born in the town&s;hip of Dartmouth and county of Bri&s;tol in New England, on the 22d. of the 4th. month 1681; my parents profe&s;&s;ed the truth in their latter years; and as I grew to years of under&s;tanding the Lord was plea&s;ed to fa|vour me with the knowledge of his ble&s;&s;ed truth, and the work and operation thereof in my own heart, that by the virtue of it I came to be very much weaned from the vanities and delights of the world, and peri&s;hing pa&s;|times that are therein, and tho&s;e things that I was inclined to by nature. And as I came to be acquainted with the di&s;cipline of the cro&s;s, and the divine light &s;hining in my heart, about
<PB N="6" REF="038519_0004_101229190ED34DA8">the 22d. year of my age, I was called to bear my te&s;timony again&s;t wars and fightings, as being contrary to the doctrine of Chri&s;t, and the nature of his kingdom, and could not join with tho&s;e that were for bearing arms for the defence of the country, again&s;t the French and Indian enemy; and accordingly, on the 15th. of the 6th. month 1703, I was notified by one William Hart, called a corporal, to ap|pear at the town hou&s;e in Dartmouth, in or|der to engage in the &s;ervice propo&s;ed, under Benjamin Church, called captain, but refu|&s;ing for con&s;cience &s;ake to comply, I was &s;ummoned on the 14th. of the 1&s;t. month 1704, to appear before Nathaniel By|field and Ebenezer Brenton, two magi&s;|trates of &s;aid county of Bri&s;tol, and examined concerning my &s;aid refu&s;al, in which I &s;till per&s;i&s;ting for the rea&s;ons above &s;aid, I was fined in the &s;um of five pounds, and one pound three &s;hillings charges. But having a months time to con&s;ider whether to pay &s;aid fine or not, I found mo&s;t peace in refu&s;ing, for which I was &s;entenced to pri&s;on till payment thereof, where I remained till the general &s;e&s;&s;ions in the &s;econd month following, and was then required to pay
<PB N="7" REF="038519_0005_1012291C020AA4E0">&s;aid fine and charges: but &s;till refu&s;ing for the rea&s;on afore&s;aid, proclamation was made in court that I &s;hould be hired out to work to any that wanted a hand, for any time not exceeding four years, in order to &s;atisfy &s;aid fine &amp;c. but none offering to ac|cept my &s;ervice as above, I was &s;ent to pri&s;on again, there to remain till an order was pro|cured from the governor to remove me to Bo&s;ton ca&s;tle, there to work as a pri&s;oner till &s;aid fine was &s;atisfied. Here I continued in great peace of mind about two weeks, often being made &s;en&s;ible of Divine kindne&s;s in this my confined condition: at the end of two weeks, the above &s;aid Benjamin Church came and commanded me out of pri&s;on, which I refu&s;ed to comply with, without the gover|nors order agreeable to the judgment of Court, which order he never produced, but forcibly took me out of pri&s;on, and I was ordered on board a ve&s;&s;el to be &s;ent to Bo&s;ton ca&s;tle; and on our way through the town we met two of our friends, who in a friendly manner a&s;ked the per&s;on who commanded me, what art thou going to do with our friend? he an&s;wered he was going to take him to Bo&s;ton ca&s;tle: the friends remarked to him,
<PB N="8" REF="038519_0006_1012291E1D62FEB8">how &s;ome people in &s;uch ca&s;es had been di&s;|appointed in their expectation and their ve&s;&s;els in danger of being lo&s;t: but notwith|&s;tanding this precaution, he per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution till it had like to have been our ca&s;e, for being put on board a ve&s;&s;el which had but little balla&s;t in her, and &s;ailing on our way to Bo&s;ton, being about twenty leagues by water, there came a &s;quall of wind and laid our ve&s;&s;el on one &s;ide, on which I ran and loo&s;ed the &s;ails, &s;o that &s;he got righted before any of the hands came to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which the hands on board &s;eeing were glad of my company, and I was thankful to our great pre&s;erver for this merciful deliverance. Be|ing got to Bo&s;ton we met &s;aid colonel Church, for he was both colonel and captain; I was allowed the liberty of the town, only to meet at a certain inn about the &s;ixth hour every evening (which liberty I thought was a trial to me, whether I would get away from them or not, but I was their true pri&s;oner, truths te&s;timony being more precious to me at that time than my outward liberty,) which order I punctually obeyed, &s;o that I had time to &s;ee my friends in the town, who &s;hewed great kindne&s;s and re&s;pect to me. Thus I
<PB N="9" REF="038519_0007_10122921998F1B28">continued a pri&s;oner at large in the town of Bo&s;ton about a week, for the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el that brought me there, being &s;en&s;ible of the danger he was in at that time, could not be prevailed with to take me to the ca&s;tle, nor be concerned further with me as a pri|&s;oner, but afterwards on the fifth of the third month, I was conveyed to the ca&s;tle where I remained a pri&s;oner four months and four days, being a pri&s;oner from my fir&s;t confine|ment &s;even months and two days. And notwith&s;tanding &s;ome pains were taken to obtain my liberty, particularly by our friend Thomas Story who was travelling in New England at that time, in truth's &s;ervice, yet it had not the de&s;ired effect; during which time the people behaved civilly towards me, as believing I acted from a religious principle, but finding they could not make me &s;ubmit to them they &s;et me at liberty. On my mother's application to the governor, and making my ca&s;e known to him, he ordered his clerk to write to the captain of the ca&s;tle, an order for me to be relea&s;ed, which was done accor|dingly. During the time of my confinement in the ca&s;tle, there came a kin&s;man of mine to &s;ee me, he was of &s;ome con&s;iderable note
<PB N="10" REF="038519_0008_101229231F57CDC0">in the worlds account, and therefore came in di&s;gui&s;e, not de&s;iring his being there &s;hould be known, but as in a friendly vi&s;it: calling me a&s;ide, he &s;aid, cou&s;in, &s;ince you have be|gun, I would have you hold to your princi|ples, adding I have nothing to di&s;courage you, but believe if you are faithful the Lord will pro&s;per you in your undertaking, which he &s;poke in much love and affection, and at parting prayed the Lord to ble&s;s me; which kind vi&s;it from one who did not profe&s;s the truth, was comfortable and &s;trengthening to me in this my &s;uffering &s;tate.</P>
<P>So being at liberty as above, I returned home to my fathers family, in much peace of mind, with prai&s;es to the Almighty for my deliverance thus far, where I followed my lawful calling, till near the &s;pring following, when I &s;hipped my&s;elf on board the brigan|tine,&mdash;Matthew Ea&s;tow commander, bound for London. It proved a very &s;tormy voyage, &s;o that divers times we expected to be ca&s;t away, but the merciful hand was our pre&s;erver. I had many times with true thankfulne&s;s of heart to ble&s;s and magnify his great and holy name, in a &s;weet &s;en&s;e of his mercy and good|ne&s;s to me.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="038519_0009_1012292980549C28">
In about eight weeks &s;ailing, we made King|&s;ale harbour in the we&s;t of Ireland, where we tarried about eight days, and then weighed anchor and &s;ailed for London. We came to the land&s;end of England on the 13th. of the 4th. month 1705, and next day near Ply|mouth, a man of war met us, and took me and two more of our hands; but the captain &s;ent us on board our own ve&s;&s;el again that night. There lay &s;eventeen &s;ail of men of war in Plymouth harbour at that time, one of which &s;ent their boat with &s;ome hands, and took my companion Thomas Anthony, who came with me from New England and my&s;elf on board their &s;hip, leaving but three hands in the ve&s;&s;el with our ma&s;ter, although he was very weak, and not capable of any bu&s;ine&s;s. The &s;hip we were taken on board of lay about five leagues off, and the next day went out a crui&s;ing: the lieutenant was very envious, and &s;wore divers times that he would run us through with his &s;word; the captain &s;eemed more moderate, although not inclined to &s;et us at liberty. The day after we &s;ailed, the &s;hip we were in took a French prize with fifty En|gli&s;h pri&s;oners on board: when they were going to engage, they placed us to a gun,
<PB N="12" REF="038519_0010_1012292BE9530A60">and commanded us to fight, but we told them we could not, for Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles &s;pake to the contrary; but they not regarding what we &s;aid, hauled us about the deck to make us work, but we &s;ignified we could not on any &s;uch account: now expecting our trials likely to increa&s;e, we thought it nece&s;&s;ary to be con&s;tantly upon our watch both inwardly and outwardly, with &s;trong cries to the Lord that he would be near to &s;upport us under our exerci&s;es; al&s;o we thought it not &s;afe that both of us &s;hould lie down together, &s;o it happened on the 18th. of the month that Thomas Anthony being gone to lay down, I being unea&s;y in my mind had a concern to go upon deck, for what rea&s;on I knew not at that time, but being faithful I went upon deck, and therein I found peace; upon which I went between decks again, but growing un|ea&s;y in my mind, a concern aro&s;e to go upon deck the &s;econd time, and when there, &s;eem|ed quite ea&s;y; then fearing le&s;t I was out of my place I went down a third time, and growing very unea&s;y, it was &s;aid in the &s;ecret of my heart, thou knowe&s;t where to get relief; upon which I went the third time upon deck,
<PB N="13" REF="038519_0011_1012292D6E7D90C8">and being there &s;ome time, the lieutenant who was walking on the quarter deck, &s;aid to the boat&s;wain who was on the main deck, have you made the Quaker work yet? he an|&s;wered no. The lieutenant a&s;ked why? was an&s;wered, it is for want of your order; on which the lieutenant threw him his cane, &s;ay|ing, there is my order, then the boat&s;wain took the cane and laid on my head with &s;uch violence, that he beat my hat to pieces, on which the lieutenant &s;aid, take him to the geers, and bring the cat and nine tails, at which time I was freely given up to &s;uffer what they might be permitted to inflict on me; and being at the geers on my knees, it aro&s;e in my mind to pray for my per&s;ecutors, for they knew not what they did; and if it plea&s;ed the Lord, to take me to him&s;elf from among&s;t them, for their wicked conver&s;ation was a burden to my life; and indeed my life was not dear to me at that time, to lay down for truths te&s;timony if required; but through the Lord's mercy they were not &s;uffered to &s;trike me any more. Soon after the captain &s;ent for me and Thomas Anthony into the cabbin, where being come he talked much with us, and on &s;eeing my hat he a&s;ked how
<PB N="14" REF="038519_0012_1012292EF35094D8">it came torn &s;o, was an&s;wered it was done at the boat&s;wains plea&s;ure. There was the cap|tain of another man of war with him, who &s;wore he would kill us, as &s;oon as he would kill a Frenchman, with many &s;uch expre&s;&s;i|ons. The boat&s;wains mate &s;eeing how I was u&s;ed, took me by the &s;houlder, and a&s;ked why I did not &s;tay below decks as he would have me, adding you have been beat enough to kill an ox; which expre&s;&s;ions of his &s;hew|ed &s;ome re&s;pect he had to me, though other|wi&s;e bad enough in his conver&s;ation; but the &s;weet peace and &s;atisfaction of mind, that I enjoyed in this time of my &s;uffering, is &s;carce to be expre&s;&s;ed in words, and far exceeded their &s;hew of kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Now there being upwards of twenty &s;ail of the Engli&s;h together at that time, in a few days they &s;ailed to Bre&s;t, a place in France, to fight the French fleet, but they not coming out, and our fleet meeting with a &s;torm that &s;everal &s;hips lo&s;t their top ma&s;ts, we &s;ailed for England, and went into Torbay, and lay there three days, in which time I de&s;ired the captain to &s;et us at liberty; but he &s;aid if we would work, we &s;hould have our liberty, purpo&s;ely as we thought to en&s;nare us; but
<PB N="15" REF="038519_0013_10122930811BDBF8">through the Lord's mercy and goodne&s;s to us, we were pre&s;erved from their &s;nares, and found his pure peace and pre&s;ence, to be with us in a large manner, that in the great|e&s;t of our &s;ufferings and trials, he was near, and in his comfortable pre&s;ence we did rejoice, that we were counted worthy to &s;uffer for truth's te&s;timony. The Sd. of the 5th. month we &s;ailed for Plymouth, but came not to an anchor: the captain went on &s;hore, and we &s;ent a letter to a friend of ours at Plymouth, but received no an&s;wer. The next day we &s;ailed for Bre&s;t again, being more than forty &s;ail in company, and the &s;hip we were in, and another, went to the mouth of the harbour, and took a &s;hip going in loaded with &s;alt, and lay off from U&s;hant waiting for the French fleet, until our hopes of getting clear from them was almo&s;t &s;pent. At another time they &s;ent for me to make points for reefing the fails, which I refu&s;ing to do, &s;ome mocked and &s;coffed, while others filled with envy and malice, could &s;carce keep their hands from me: and thus we pa&s;&s;ed through many deep exerci&s;es, looking every day when we &s;hould receive &s;tripes, and &s;ometimes could &s;ee no|thing but death before us, but the Lord
<PB N="16" REF="038519_0014_101229340F01F6F8">wrought deliverance for us in his own way and time, beyond our expectation, and hath been near for our pre&s;ervation, ble&s;&s;ed be his great name therefor.</P>
<P>The 14th. of this month we &s;ailed to Bre&s;t to &s;py what &s;hipping there was in the harbour, and we went &s;o near in, that the French fired many guns at us from the ca&s;tle. I and my companion Thomas Anthony &s;at then between decks, not knowing how &s;oon it might be our lots to be &s;hot; my companion not being well at that time nor for &s;everal days before, the doctor &s;ent his mate in kindne&s;s to enquire if he wanted any thing he had that he &s;hould have it, but he refu&s;ed taking any thing from him, altho' he acknowledged his kindne&s;s. The 20th. of this month we &s;ailed for Bre&s;t again, and being becalmed, we thought we mu&s;t come to an anchor, which if we had it might have gone hard with us; but after &s;ome time there &s;prang up a breeze of wind, and we got away from the French, and a few days after we &s;ailed for England again, and got into Plymouth harbour.</P>
<P>So on the 27th. of this month as &s;oon as we came to an anchor, the captain &s;ent for us
<PB N="17" REF="038519_0015_10122937009A8E68">into the cabbin, and being before him, he &s;aid he would let us go on &s;hore, to &s;ee our friends, and refre&s;h our&s;elves, which he did: &s;o being on &s;hore, and it being meeting day we went to the meeting, although in a poor dirty condition by rea&s;on of our lying on board &s;o long, and no cloaths to &s;hift us, ha|ving been on board about &s;ix weeks. Friends were glad to &s;ee us on &s;hore, and kindly recei|ved us into their hou&s;es. The fir&s;t friends hou&s;e we went to was Henry Cane or Crane who was very kind to us, and provided things ne|ce&s;&s;ary for us. And Daniel Zachary the owner of the ve&s;&s;el we were pre&s;&s;ed out of, had wrote to a friend of Plymoth to take care of us when we came on &s;hore, al&s;o a friend of London that was appointed by their mornings meeting, &s;ent a letter to a friend of his at Plymoth, to help us to what nece&s;&s;aries we &s;tood in need of, and he would pay him again, which he did; al&s;o &s;aid friend &s;poke to the captain twice about &s;etting us at liberty. Since we were not men for his purpo&s;e, the captain &s;aid he gave us leave to go on &s;hore, but &s;aid nothing of our coming on board again, &s;aying he could not an&s;wer di&s;charging us, becau&s;e he was under the command of the flag.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="038519_0016_101229390A7039D8">
So having well refre&s;hed our&s;elves, and were provided with nece&s;&s;aries we travelled through &s;everal towns, as Exeter, Bri&s;tol, Bath, and divers others, till we came to London, when there we lodged at our friend Thomas Lurtings, and having tarried near four weeks in London, al&s;o attended meet|ings as they came in cour&s;e pretty con&s;tantly. We got a pa&s;&s;age to Philadelphia in a ve&s;&s;el commanded by one Jo&s;hua Guy, there were divers friends going in her, as John Salkeld and wife, with other pa&s;&s;engers. About the 9th. of the 7th. month 1705, we left London, and the ve&s;&s;el fell down to Deal, where my companion Thomas Anthony being taken &s;ick of the &s;mall pox, he was put on &s;hore at Deal.</P>

<P>Ab&s;tracted from <HI>"A Collection of the Sufferings of the People called Quakers."</HI> Vol. 2. pa. 112, compiled by Jo&s;eph Be&s;&s;e, printed in London Anno. 1753 with this remark,&mdash;viz.</P>
<Q>The following narrative we have thought proper to in&s;ert in the very words of the Sufferer, as taken from his own mouth.

<P><HI>These are</HI> (&s;ays the writer) <HI>the very words that proceeded from him, who sat before me weeping,</HI>&mdash;viz.</P>
<P>I WAS pre&s;&s;ed in Scarborough-Piers, and refu&s;ing to go on board the ketch, they beat me very &s;ore on the &s;and, and I refu&s;ing to go on board, they hoi&s;ted me in with a tackle, on board of the ketch that pre&s;&s;ed for the &s;hip called the Royal-Prince, and they bunch|ed me with their feet, that I fell into a tub, and was &s;o maimed, that they were forced to &s;waddle me up with cloths: from thence we &s;ailed into Bridlington-Bay, where Thomas Swailes and Mary Stranger hearing of me &s;ent me victuals on board the ketch; then we &s;ailed to the Buoy and Nore, where
<PB N="22" REF="038519_0019_1012293FB8611B00">they haul'd me in at a gun-port, on board of the &s;hip called the Royal-Prince. The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> day of the third month they commanded me to go to work at the cap&s;tane; I refu&s;ed, and told them, that as I was not free to do the king's work, I would not live at his charge for vic|tuals; then the boat&s;wain's mate beat me &s;ore, and thru&s;ting me about with the cap|&s;tane till he was weary. Then the Captain &s;ent for me upon the quarter-deck, and a&s;ked me, why I refu&s;ed to fight for the king, and why I refu&s;ed to eat of his victuals? I told him, I was afraid to offend God, for my warfare was &s;piritual, therefore I dur&s;t not fight with carnal weapons. Then he fell upon me and beat me with his &s;mall cane, then called for his great cane, and beat me &s;ore, and felled me down to the deck three or four times, and beat me as long as his &s;trength continued. Then came one Thomas Hor|ner, (who was brought up at Ea&s;ington) and &s;aid, I pray you, noble captain, be merciful, for I know him to be an hone&s;t man, and a good man. Then &s;aid the captain, he is a Quaker, I will beat his brains out; then falling on me again, he beat me till he was weary; then called &s;ome to help him, for, &s;aid he, I am not able to beat him enough to
<PB N="23" REF="038519_0020_10122941C254BDA0">make him willing to do the king's &s;ervice. Then came out the commander's je&s;ter, and told the captain, he would lay a guinea with him that he would make me work, and haul the king's ropes, and told the captain he was a fool; &s;o two guineas were thrown down upon the deck, then the je&s;ter called for two &s;eamen, and made them make two-ropes fa&s;t to the wri&s;ts of my arms, and reeved the ropes through two blocks in the mizen|&s;hrouds, on the &s;tarboard-&s;ide, and hoi&s;ted me up aloft, and made the ropes fa&s;t to the gunnel of the &s;hip, and I hung &s;ome time; then the je&s;ter called the &s;hips company to behold, and bear him witne&s;s, that he made the Quaker haul the king's ropes; &s;o veer|ing the ropes, they lowered me half way down, then made me fa&s;t again: now, &s;aid the je&s;ter, noble captain, you and the company &s;ee that the Quaker hauleth the king's ropes, and with that he commanded them to let fly the ropes loo&s;e, where I fell upon the deck: now &s;aid the je&s;ter, noble captain the wager is won, he haul'd the ropes to the deck, and you can haul them no farther, nor any man el&s;e. Then the captain called the boat&s;wain's mate, and bid him take the Quakerly-dog away, and
<PB N="24" REF="038519_0021_101229434FD39AF0">put him to the cap&s;tane, and make him work, and beat him and &s;pare him not. So the boat&s;wain's mate had me down to the geer|cap&s;tane, and thru&s;t me about with the men at the cap&s;tane, and beat me withal, when he could get time; then he went and &s;at him down upon a che&s;t-lid, and I went and &s;at down upon another che&s;t-lid be&s;ide him, then he fell on me and beat me again, then called his boy to bring his two &s;eizings, and he &s;ei|zed my arms to the cap&s;tane's bars, and cau|&s;ed the men to heave the cap&s;tane about, and in three or four times pa&s;&s;ing about, the &s;eizings were loo&s;ed, no man knew how, nor when, nor could they ever be found, al|though they &s;ought them with lighted candles; then the boat&s;wain's mate, &s;eeing what was done, cau&s;ed all the men to come from the cap&s;tane, and took a bible, and commanded them all to &s;wear, that they neither loo&s;ed me, nor knew how I came loo&s;e, (they all being willing to &s;wear) he then &s;earched their pockets for the &s;eizings, but could find none, &s;o he let them go; then he called them all again to him, and &s;aid, hear what I &s;hall &s;ay to you; you &s;ee this is a wonderful thing, which is done by an invi&s;ible hand, which loo&s;ed
<PB N="25" REF="038519_0022_10122946ECE98B18">him, for none of you could &s;ee his hands loo&s;ed, that were &s;o near him: I &s;uppo&s;e this man, &s;aid he, is called a Quaker, and for con&s;cience-&s;ake refu&s;eth to act, therefore I am afflicted, and do promi&s;e before God and man, that I will never beat, nor cau&s;e to be beaten, either Quaker, or any other man that doth refu&s;e for con&s;cience-&s;ake to act for the king; if I do, I wi&s;h I may lo&s;e my right hand.</P>
<P>Then on the third day came the admiral, Sir Edward Spragg, on board of his own &s;hip, called the Royal-Prince, and hearing of a man that was pre&s;&s;ed on board, that was called a Quaker; al&s;o hearing that the boat|&s;wain's mate had beaten me much, and had given me over, and had denied to beat me any more, he was therefore called to come before the admiral, to an&s;wer for him&s;elf, why he would not beat the Quaker? he &s;aid, I have beat him very &s;ore, and I &s;eized his arms to the cap&s;tane's bars, and forced them to heave him about, and beat him, and then &s;at down, and in three or four times of the cap&s;tanes going about, the &s;eizings were loo&s;ed, and he came and &s;at down by me;
<PB N="26" REF="038519_0023_101229487376E188">then I called the men from the cap&s;tane, and took them &s;worn, whether they had loo&s;ed him or no, but they all denied that they either loo&s;ed him, or knew by what means he was loo&s;ed, neither could the &s;eiz|ings ever be found; therefore I did, and do believe that it was an invi&s;ible power that &s;et him at liberty, and I did promi&s;e before God and the company, that I would never beat a Quaker again, nor any man el&s;e for con&s;cience &s;ake. The admiral told him, he mu&s;t lo&s;e his cane: he willingly yielded it, and told him, he mu&s;t al&s;o lo&s;e his place: he was willing. He al&s;o told him, he mu&s;t lo&s;e his right hand: he held it out and &s;aid, take it from me if you plea&s;e. So they took his cane from him, and di&s;placed him. So the com|mander gave order to the &s;even yeomen, to beat me where ever they met me, for &s;even days and nights, and make me work: they being called to an account, what they had made me do? told the commander that they were weary, and could not make me work, &s;o they de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed. Then the eighth yeoman was called, who promi&s;ed he would beat me, and make me work; and he did beat me for a day and a night, when he met with me, and he being weary, he de&s;ired
<PB N="27" REF="038519_0024_1012294B465598E8">to be excu&s;ed. Then the commander &s;ent for me upon the quarter-deck before him, and cau&s;ed my clothes to be &s;tript off, &s;hirt and all, from my wai&s;t downward, then he took a view of my body to &s;ee what wounds and brui&s;es I had, but he could find none, no not &s;o much as a blue &s;pot on my &s;kin. Then the commander was angry with them for not beating me enough: then captain Fowler an&s;wered him and &s;aid, I have beat him my&s;elf as much as would have killed an ox. The je&s;ter &s;aid, he had me hung a great while by my arms up aloft in the &s;hrouds. The men &s;aid, they had al&s;o beat me very fore, and they might as well beat the main-ma&s;t. Then &s;aid the commander, I will cau&s;e irons to be laid upon him during the king's plea&s;ure and mine. Then the boat&s;wain was called, and commanded to call the &s;hip's company together, and make ready the irons: the commander Sir Edward Spragg, &s;aid, you gentlemen &s;ailors and &s;oldiers, who&s;oever &s;erves here under me for the king, on board his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip called the Royal-Prince, the admiral of the blue, you are to take notice, that there is a man on board called a quaker, he is to be laid in irons during the king's plea&s;ure and mine, for refu&s;ing to fight and
<PB N="28" REF="038519_0025_1012294D5BDEB078">eat the king's victuals, therefore I charge you all and every man, that none of you give or &s;ell him any victuals, meat, drink, or water, for if you do, you &s;hall have the &s;ame puni&s;h|ment that he hath. So this being called three times over, he commanded the boat&s;wain to take me away and put me in irons. So I being kept in irons &s;ix days and nights, and falling &s;ick of a fever, I grew very weak, in|&s;omuch that when I was &s;et out to ca&s;e my&s;elf, (which was but once in twenty four hours) I could neither &s;tand nor go: &s;o the officers that let me out, called &s;ome of my country|men to carry me into the &s;hip's head to ea&s;e my&s;elf, and bring me back again to the irons. Then the officer took pity of me, and bid me lay down upon the bilboes that night, and he would hap me with a coverlid, &s;o I lay there that night, and next day till evening; then the officer de&s;ired me to go by the way a little, &s;eeing all was quiet, and &s;ee if I could get a little re&s;t: &s;o I being lame of a leg with the irons, was creeping over the larboard &s;ide of the &s;hip, the lieutenant coming down, &s;aid, thou damn'd rogue, (and many other wicked words) ha&s;t thou broken the irons? and with that drew his rapier, and &s;wore
<PB N="29" REF="038519_0026_1012294F93C612A0">he would &s;tab me, and &s;o drove me back again to the irons, and called the yeomen, and would have known who let me out, and he &s;hould be puni&s;hed, and I would not tell him; but the &s;ame yeoman came in the crowd, and I put my hand out to him, and he locked it, and none knew how: I then being the king's pri&s;oner, I bid them begone, they had nothing to do with me: &s;o I remained in irons &s;ix days more, and recovered very well of my weak|ne&s;s: then on the &s;eventh day at night, &s;ever|al, all &s;eamen, fell to drinking of brandy, and playing at cards, and became very loud, the boat&s;wain's mate hearing of them, came down, and de&s;ired them to leave off; they being full of drink, would not, &s;o a quarrel aro&s;e, and the boat&s;wain's mate cried out murder, and immediately there came a&s;&s;i&s;tance to him, but the men ran away and hid them&s;elves, only two were taken, and put in irons with me.</P>
<P>"Now I &s;hall &s;peak a little of the carpenter's mate's Lindne&s;s to me; when I had been in irons &s;ome days, and my food being taken from me, which was three day's victuals, that I had left of that which Thomas Swales

<PB N="31" REF="038519_0028_1012295325B5FDE0">&s;aid, you would have him kill'd, &s;o now we will kill him for you; then he came down the third time in the morning, and found them lying upon me, for they &s;et one to watch his coming, and he found them lying very clo&s;e upon me, &s;o that he could &s;ee nothing but my feet, I being &s;o pre&s;&s;ed and weak, that he could &s;carce hear my voice.</P>
<P>Then the lieutenant went to Sir Edward's cabbin door, and knocked; the boy an&s;wered, who was there? he told him, it was the lieute|nant who would &s;peak to Sir Edward, for there had been a mutiny in the &s;hip by &s;ome men playing at cards, and they had beat the boat|wain's mate: he told him, he &s;hould have laid them in irons, and not called on him. He &s;aid, they are already in the bilboes. He al&s;o &s;aid, if it plea&s;e your highne&s;s Sir Edward, to remember, that there is a poor Quaker in yet, that was laid in two weeks &s;ince, and they will lie no where but upon him, and they will kill him for us. He bid him go to the yeomen that had the keys, and take him out of the bilboes, and put up a flag at the mizen|ma&s;t's head and call a council of war;
<PB N="32" REF="038519_0029_10122957256D8B00">which was done: then the captains of the other &s;hips all came on board to an&s;wer the council of war, before eight o'clock in the morning, (it being the fir&s;t day of the week) &s;o I being brought before the council of war, the commander a&s;ked me, if I would go on board of an hoy that was a tender, and had &s;ix guns? I refu&s;ed, and de&s;ired to &s;tay on board, and bear the puni&s;hment that I had to abide. Then he bid the council of war go on with their bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o they did proceed, and I being &s;et on a bulk head, being &s;o lame with the irons that I could not &s;tand, and hearing them pa&s;s &s;entence of condemnation upon me. The judge was a Papi&s;t, being govern|or of Dover ca&s;tle, and went to &s;ea on plea|&s;ure. So they could not tell at pre&s;ent what death to put me to; the judge &s;aid, I &s;hould be put into a barrel or ca&s;k driven full of nails with their points inwards, and &s;o roll'd to death. But the council of war taking it into con&s;ideration, thought it too terrible a death, and too much unchri&s;tian-like, &s;o they agreed to hang me: and I hearing them &s;peak &s;eve|ral things again&s;t me, which I was clear of, had a de&s;ire to ari&s;e from my knees where I was &s;et to an&s;wer for my&s;elf, but I had not
<PB N="33" REF="038519_0030_10122958AC35B020">any power to ari&s;e or open my mouth, but was condemned within my&s;elf, in&s;omuch that I had not power to breathe unto God; prof|fering to ri&s;e again the &s;econd time, there came a motion within me, and bid me be &s;till, be &s;till, be &s;till, three times, which I obeyed and was comforted; then I believed God would ari&s;e: and when they had done &s;peak|ing, then God did ari&s;e, and I was filled with the power of God, and my &s;pirit lifted up above all earthly things, and wonderful &s;trength was given me to my limbs, and my heart full of the power and wi&s;dom of God, and with glad tidings my mouth was opened to declare to the people the things which God had made manife&s;t to me: with &s;weat run|ning down, and tears trickling from my eyes, I told them, "the hearts of kings were in the hand of the Lord, and &s;o are both yours and mine, and I do not value what you can do to this body, for I am at peace with God and all men, and you my adver&s;aries; for if I might have an hundred and thirty years longer, I can never die in a better condition, for the Lord hath &s;atisfied me, that he hath forgiven me all things in this world, and I am glad through his mercy, that he hath made me

Then there came a man and laid his hand upon my &s;houlder, and &s;aid, where are all thy accu&s;ers? then my eyes were opened, and I looked about me, and they were all gone; and one &s;aid there goeth thy chief friend, the judge: then it aro&s;e in my heart, that I had news for him from the power of God, and I &s;aid, man come back, I have news for thee better than ever thou hearde&s;t in any coffee-hou&s;e, or el&s;ewhere; and an&s;wer for what thou ha&s;t done. Then came a lieu|tenant, and &s;aid, Sir. Edward, this is an hypocrite Quaker. I &s;aid, commander, I entreat thee to look upon me a little, &s;o I loo&s;ed my knee-&s;tring and put down my &s;tockings, and let him &s;ee how the blood and rotten &s;tuff ran down my leg round about; he &s;aid, put up thy &s;tocking, there is enough. Then pre&s;ently came an antient &s;oldier, and loo&s;ed down his knee-&s;trings, and put down his &s;tockings, put his cap under his knees, and begged his pardon three times: then &s;aid he, ari&s;e up &s;oldier, and &s;peak, and he intreated him and &s;aid, "noble Sir Edward,

Then came the chief gunner, that had been a captain, and loo&s;ed down his knee|&s;trings, and did beg his pardon three times, being upon his bare knees before Sir Edward: then he &s;aid, ari&s;e up gunner and &s;peak. So he &s;aid. "if it plea&s;e your wor&s;hip, Sir Edward, we know you are a merciful man, and therefore I intreat you in all kindne&s;s, to be merciful to this poor man, in whom there remains &s;omething more than fle&s;h and blood, therefore I intreat you, let us not de&s;troy that which is alive, neither endea|vour to do it: and &s;o God ble&s;s you Sir Ed|ward, I have no more to &s;ay to you." Then he went away. Then the commander de&s;ired me to go down and take my leave of my friends (this day) that were on board; &s;o he gave orders, that any that had a mind to give me victuals might, and that I might eat and drink with whom I plea&s;ed, and that none &s;hould mole&s;t me that day. Then came the lieutenant, and &s;at down by me while they were at their wor&s;hip, and he would have given me brandy, but I refu&s;ed: then the dinner came up to be &s;erved, and &s;everal gave me victuals to eat, and I did eat freely, and was kindly entertained that day; then
<PB N="37" REF="038519_0034_101229628D0D8998">the night being come, a man kindly proffered me his hammock to lie in that night, becau&s;e I had lain long in irons, and I accepted of his kindne&s;s, and laid me down, and &s;lept well that night. The next morning being come, it being the &s;econd day of the week, on which I was to be executed, about eight of the clock in the morning, the rope being reeved upon the mizen-yard's arm, and the boy ready to turn me off, and boats having come on board with captains of other &s;hips that were of the council of war, who came on purpo&s;e to &s;ee me executed; I was there|upon called to come to be executed, then I coming to the execution place, the command|er a&s;ked the council, how their judgment did &s;tand? &s;o mo&s;t of them did con&s;ent, and &s;ome of them were &s;ilent. Then he de&s;ired me freely to &s;peak my mind, if I had any thing to &s;ay before I was executed: I told him, I had little at pre&s;ent to &s;peak. So there came a man and bid me go forward to be executed, &s;o I &s;tepped upon the gunnel to go towards the rope; the commander bid me &s;top there if I had any thing to &s;ay. Then &s;pake the judge, and &s;aid, Sir Edward is a merciful man, that puts that heretick to
<PB N="38" REF="038519_0035_1012296411761F90">no wor&s;e death than hanging. Sir Edward turned him about to the judge, and &s;aid, what &s;aid&s;t thou? I &s;ay, replied he, you are a merciful man, that puts him to no wor&s;e death than hanging. But, &s;aid he, what is the other word that thou &s;aid&s;t, that heretick: I &s;ay, &s;aid the commander, he is more a chri&s;tian than thy&s;elf; for I do believe thou would&s;t hang me, if it were in thy power. Then &s;aid the commander unto me, "come down again, I will not hurt an hair of thine head, for I cannot make one hair grow." Then he cried, &s;ilence all men, and pro|claimed it three times over, that "if any man or men on board of the &s;hip would come and give evidence, that I had done any thing that I had de&s;erved death for, I &s;hould have it, provided they were credible per&s;ons." But no body came, neither opened a mouth again&s;t me then. So he cried again, &s;ilence all men, and hear me &s;peak: then he pro|claimed, that the Quaker was as free a man as any on board the &s;hip was. So the men heaved up their hats, and with a loud voice cried, God ble&s;s Sir Edward, he is a merci|ful man: the &s;hrouds, the tops, and decks
<PB N="39" REF="038519_0036_101229668EDB6FB0">being full of men, &s;everal of their hats flew over board and were lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Then I had great kindne&s;s &s;hewn me by all men on board, but the great kindne&s;s of the Lord exceeded all, for the day I was condemned to die on, was the mo&s;t joyful day that ever I had in my life-time, and &s;o remained exceeding joyful, until the very time that I was proclaimed a free man. But &s;oon after troubles came upon me again, for I being laid upon the deck one night, as it was my u&s;ual lodging-place, there was &s;ome|thing appeared to me, and &s;truck me as it were dead, and I being in great dread and fear, believed our &s;hip was to engage &s;uch a day of the month, with the wind at &s;outh ea&s;t, then appeared al&s;o a &s;mall cloud to me about as big as an hat; after being engaged, the &s;ame cloud &s;pread and became a great one, in&s;omuch that it darkened part of the &s;hip, then I &s;tepped over on the &s;tarboard|&s;ide of the &s;hip, into the &s;hrouds, and looked aft, and I &s;aw a thick water ari&s;ing in the wake of the rudder, then I feared the &s;hip was near ground. This appeared to me three times that night, and I would gladly have put it from me, but I could not: then
<PB N="40" REF="038519_0037_1012296996E004A0">I did believe, and was &s;atisfied of the truth of it, then I was at peace and quiet in my own mind, but then I was to make it known to the pilot, and I did believe it was death by law to di&s;courage them: &s;o I thought, then I &s;hould give them an occa&s;ion that they &s;hould take away my life; but I could not re&s;t, eat, drink, or &s;leep, until I had declared it; &s;o I breathed unto God, and de&s;ired that he would find me a way to reveal it, &s;o it remaining with me two days and two nights, and being walking upon the deck, and tak|ing notice of the chief gunner of the &s;hip, I was ordered to go to him, and walk with him; very &s;olitary were both of us, and he perceived I had &s;omething to &s;ay to him, of &s;ome weighty matter, &s;o he de&s;ired me to &s;peak my mind to him, and I told him, I had &s;uch a weighty matter to declare, that it was death by the law to declare it, I de&s;ired that he would &s;tand true to me in that re|&s;pect, and he promi&s;ed me fidelity in the pre&s;ence of God, before whom we were: that he would be true to me in all re&s;pects, and if one &s;uffered, both &s;hould &s;uffer. Then we e&s;pied the mate of the &s;hip walking, he being a &s;ober man, we drew near to him, and
<PB N="41" REF="038519_0038_1012296C0B8DF648">he perceived we were both afflicted, and de|&s;ired to know what was the matter? &s;o we told him, we had a weighty matter, and if he would be as faithful to us, as we were one to another, we would declare it to him: &s;o he promi&s;ed to be faithful to us, for he did be|lieve it did concern him: then we told him the matter, and he was fully &s;atisfied of the truth of it; but &s;aid he, it doth belong mo&s;t of all to the pilot; &s;o we mu&s;t &s;peak to him, and he being &s;uch a brittle, high-&s;pirited man, we &s;carce knew how to &s;peak to him, but cal|ling him to us, and walking with him, he took notice of our heavine&s;s, and a&s;ked our bu&s;ine&s;s with him; we told him, we had a matter to declare to him of great concern, therefore we de&s;ired him to be faithful to us, and we would declare the matter to him, and he promi&s;ed to be as faithful to us, as he &s;uppo&s;ed we were to one another: &s;o they told him the matter, then he a&s;ked, who &s;aw it?

Then he fell into a rage, and &s;eemed to fly from his promi&s;e, and &s;aid, he would go and tell the commander, &s;o away he went, and &s;aid, he would have me executed &s;peedily: I &s;aid, let him go, better I die, than the whole company peri&s;h; but they &s;aid if thou die, we will all die. Then he
<PB N="42" REF="038519_0039_10122BC31BDC89B0">came to us again near weeping, and told us that when he came before the commander, his mouth was &s;topt, that he could not &s;peak a word good or bad: he was very tender, and prai&s;ed God that he had &s;uch a me&s;&s;enger. Then he took me by the hand, and de&s;ired me to tell him the name of the &s;and, I told him I did not know, I never came there, but at that time I looked up with my eyes, and told him where-abouts the &s;and laid; &s;o he de&s;ired me to go to the compa&s;s, and he a&s;ked me, if I knew the compa&s;s; I told him, very well; &s;o I &s;hewed him upon what point of the compa&s;s the &s;aid &s;and laid, and he took a book out of his pocket, and found the &s;and, and the name of it. Some days after we were engaged on that very point with the Hollanders, and as &s;oon as we were engaged; the cloud appeared to me, and came and darkened the &s;hip, then I &s;tept into the main-&s;hrouds, and I &s;aw the thick water, then I &s;hewed the pilot it, and he called two of the be&s;t men to the lead, they cried five fathom and a quarter; then the pilot cried, &s;tarboard your helm; then the commander cried, larboard your helm, and bring her too: the pilot &s;aid, he would bring the king's &s;hip no nearer, he would give over his charge: the commander cried, bring her
<PB N="43" REF="038519_0040_1012287D52B47B90">too. The pilot cried to the leadmen, &s;ing aloud that Sir Edward may hear, (for the out|cry was very great among&s;t the officers and &s;eamen, becau&s;e the &s;hip was &s;o near a-ground, and the enemies upon them) &s;o they cried a quarter le&s;s five: the commander cried, we &s;hall have our Royal Prince on ground, take up your charge pilot. Then he cried hard, &s;tarboard your helm, and &s;ee how our &s;hip will veer; &s;o &s;he did bear round up: the men at the lead cried, five fathom and a better depth; then the commander cried, God pre|&s;erve the Royal Prince: then the pilot cried, be of good cheer, commander: they cried &s;ix fathom, then nine fathom, then fifteen fa|thom, then &s;ixteen fathom. The Hollanders then &s;houted, and cried, Sir Edward runs. Then he cried, bring her too again, and the fight continued till the middle of the day was over, and it fell calm: and the &s;hips being engaged on head of us, we could &s;ee nothing but fire and &s;moke; &s;o out of that &s;moke I e&s;pi|ed a fire-&s;hip de&s;igned to lay us on board of the larboard-bow: then I cried to the chief gunner to come to me quickly, and I &s;hewed him the fire-&s;hip coming to board us on the larboard-bow: then he fired a cha&s;e gun with a ball in her, and as &s;oon as the &s;moke was gone from the gun, we e&s;pied the fire-&s;hip all
<PB N="44" REF="038519_0041_10122BC71663D3A8">on a fire, blown up, and what remained of her &s;allied on board of the cambridge, and only burned her en&s;ign. The fight continued, and my employ was to carry down the wounded men, and look out for fire-&s;hips, and the com|mander was mightily plea&s;ed with my &s;ervice, and &s;aid, it would have been a great pity that my life &s;hould have been taken away before the engagement, and the chief gunner &s;aid, I was in&s;trumental, through mercy, not only for gi|ving notice of the &s;hip coming on ground upon the &s;and, but al&s;o for preventing of the fire|&s;hip that was near to board us, who gave me the fir&s;t notice, whereof I am witne&s;s. And the lieutenant &s;aid to the commander, that there was not a more undaunted man on board except his highne&s;s.</P>
<P>Eight days after, we were engaged again with the Hollanders, and the officers &s;ent for me upon the quarter-deck, and a&s;ked me what I would do that day? I told them I was wil|ling to do as I had done before: they de&s;ired I would do that &s;ervice, and take that care upon me, only to look out for fire-&s;hips coming on board; I told them, I was free to do it, likewi&s;e to carry down the wounded men if there were occa&s;ion; &s;o pre&s;ently we engaged, but not one fire-&s;hip troubled us that day, but we lo&s;t about two hundred men. The lieute|nant
<PB N="45" REF="038519_0042_10122BC9F8A140E0">meeting me, he a&s;ked me, if I had recei|ved any wounds? I told him, I had received none, but was well. He a&s;ked me, how came I to be &s;o bloody? then I told him, it was with carrying down wounded men. So he took me in his arms, and ki&s;&s;ed me, and that was the &s;ame lieutenant that per&s;ecuted me &s;o with irons at the fir&s;t. Then we came to the Buoy and Nore again, and then went up near Chatham, and the king coming on board, the lieutenant de&s;ired me to go and walk upon the deck, with him in &s;ight of the king, that haply &s;ome might give him notice of me, hoping I might be brought to a trial, and have my li|berty; but I did not under&s;tand that he had any intelligence of me. The next day the &s;ame lieutenant came to me, and de&s;ired me to walk along with him upon the quarter-deck: I being &s;omewhat unwilling, told him, I did not u&s;e to go upon the quarter-deck, unle&s;s I was called by the officers: he &s;aid, my uncle hath much bu&s;ine&s;s, and doth forget you, &s;o walk along with me, I de&s;ire you: and I did as he de&s;ired me, and he being with me, walked away and left me alone; the command|er being there, and &s;everal captains with him, he came from his company to me, and laid his hand upon my head and &s;aid, "thou la&s;t done well, and very well too:" &s;o he w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ked by me
<PB N="46" REF="038519_0043_10122BCB8AB75110">and I blu&s;hed; then he a&s;ked me, why I blu&s;hed? I told him I de&s;ired to know wherein I had done &s;o well: he &s;aid, by encouraging them which &s;hould have encou|raged both thee and me. Then &s;aid he, thou &s;halt have thy liberty to go on &s;hore. I a&s;ked him, if I might go on &s;hore to re|cruit, or go to my own being? he &s;aid, I &s;hould chu&s;e whether I would. I told him I had rather go to my own Being: he &s;aid I &s;hould do &s;o. Then I told him, there was one thing that I reque&s;ted of him yet, that he would be plea&s;ed to give me a certificate under his hand, to certify that I am not run away: he &s;aid, thou &s;halt have one to keep thee clear at home, and al&s;o in thy fi&s;hing; for he knew I was a fi&s;herman. So he called the captain, and ordered him to write me a certificate, and bring it to him; which he did with &s;peed, but he did not like it, but &s;lung it him again, and ordered him to make him one more legible; then he brought ano|ther, and he &s;igned it and gave it me, and wi&s;hed me well, and &s;aid, he de&s;ired to hear from me if I got well home, and I told him. I would &s;end him a letter, and &s;o I did: but &s;oon after I got into London, two pre&s;s|crews came to me, and &s;aid, this is Sir Ed|wards
<PB N="47" REF="038519_0044_10122BCDE694C520">Quaker; you are welcome to &s;hore, will you plea&s;e to go to the tavern with us? I told them I would not go, nor drink any|thing; then they wi&s;hed me well home.</P>
<P>Al&s;o they proffered me my pay, before I came off on board, and &s;aid, I de&s;erved it as well as any man on board; but I refu&s;ed, and told them, I had of my own, that I ho|ped would &s;erve me home. And the lieute|nant was troubled becau&s;e I would take nothing; he would have given me twenty &s;hillings, but I would not take it.</P>
<P>Thus ends the <HI>remarkable narrative</HI> of the &s;ufferings of this faithful &s;ailor, who rather than violate his con&s;cience by being in&s;tru|mental to de&s;troy other men's lives, endured with much patience many and &s;ore trials, per&s;evering faithful in his te&s;timony again&s;t war and fighting, even near to death; to which he was wholly re&s;igned, and from which he was pre&s;erved by a &s;ingular providence at|tending him, in tho&s;e moments of time which he thought would have been his la&s;t. But the virulence of the Popi&s;h judge again&s;t him as an Heretic, gave the commander, Sir Edward Spragg, who profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a
<PB N="48" REF="038519_0045_10122BCFA5F9E4B0">Prote&s;tant, &s;uch di&s;gu&s;t, that &s;corning to be made a tool to execute the vengeance of a Papi&s;t in this ca&s;e, he delivered the innocent man from the death he was condenmed to: Being thus pre&s;erved alive, he was made in|&s;trumental to the &s;aving of the &s;hip, and the lives of many therein: and by the exerci&s;e of an undaunted Chri&s;tian courage and con|&s;tancy, triumphed over the malice of his ad|ver&s;aries, who, con&s;cious of his innocence, at length became his friends and favourers.</P>
