<P>For the wages of &s;in is death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE bu&s;ine&s;s of a mini&s;ter of the go&s;|pel is to preach PEACE <HI>both to them that are afar off, and to them that are nigh,</HI> and to te&s;tify to tho&s;e who believe in Je&s;us <HI>that they are not under the law but under grace;</HI> yet tho&s;e who have pro|faned chri&s;tianity even in the days of the apo&s;tles, and ever &s;ince, generally have had an unaccount|able fondne&s;s for being under the law, though the law was a mini&s;tration of death as St. Paul expre&s;sly te&s;tifies; and the apo&s;tle of the Gentiles had much trouble with the Galations in this matter, they had been led away by tho&s;e who taught them that their <HI>&s;alvation</HI> depended on their keeping the law them&s;elves, which made the apo&s;tle &s;ay, Knowing that a man is not ju&s;ti|fied by the works of the law, <HI>for I through the law am lead to the law, that I might live unto</HI> GOD, <HI>I am crucified with</HI> CHRIST! <HI>neverthele&s;s I live: yet not I, but</HI> CHRIST <HI>liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the fle&s;h, I live by the faith of the &s;on of</HI> GOD, <HI>who loved me, and gave him&s;elf for me.</HI> I do not fru&s;trate the grace of GOD: for if righ|teou&s;ne&s;s come by the law, then CHRIST is dead
<PB N="4" REF="34685_0004_0FFF65EEB1076FF8">in vain. He calls them fooli&s;h, and inquires who hath be witched them; &mdash;to let go the truth of the go&s;pel which they had embraced; to take hold of the law, and rea&s;ons with them, by in|quiring if they received the &s;pirit by the works of the law, or by the preaching of the go&s;pel; know|ing that they had received the &s;pirit by the hav|ing of faith, he inquires, <HI>Are ye &s;o fooli&s;h? hav|ing begun in the &s;pirit, are ye now made perfect by the fle&s;h? Having received</HI> the &s;pirit by hearing the glad tidings of the go&s;pel, do you look to be made perfect by the ob&s;ervation of the law?&mdash; the law that made nothing perfect, only had its u&s;e in bringing in a better hope by which we draw nigh to GOD. And he lets them know that <HI>as many as are of the works of the law, are under the cur&s;e: for it is written, Cur&s;ed is every one who continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.</HI> After which &s;ays he, <HI>Ye that de&s;ire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? I am afraid of you,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>left I have be&s;tow|ed upon you labour in vain.</HI> If we were to take a critical view of tho&s;e who profe&s;s to believe in Chri&s;t at the pre&s;ent day, I believe we &s;hould find them to be chiefly Galatians. Though Je&s;us Chri&s;t has been evidently &s;et forth before their eyes in the New Te&s;tament, crucified among them, &mdash;crucified in that my&s;tical body of which he is the HEAD and they the MEMBERS,&mdash;ta&s;ting death, the wages of &s;in, for every man,&mdash;<HI>being made &s;in for us who knew no &s;in, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him.</HI> Yet they generally cry out this will not do, this is an ea&s;y way to heaven: No, no, there is &s;omething for us to do, we mu&s;t do &s;omething. One &s;ays, we can get no title to heaven unle&s;s we believe: Another &s;ays,
<PB N="5" REF="34685_0005_0FFF65F07B06DAE8">we mu&s;t repent before we &s;hall have any title: Another &s;ays, we mu&s;t believe, repent and be bap|tized, and be holy both in life and heart.&mdash; The&s;e are the conditions of our having a title to heaven. A title mu&s;t come from an owner, an heir, or purcha&s;er. Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>All things that the Father hath are mine,</HI> and this power, right or privilege is given, <HI>that he &s;hould give eternal life to as many as are thus given him.</HI>&mdash; Again, he is the appointed heir of all things, therefore our title mu&s;t flow from divine love, <HI>Behold what manner of love the Father hath be|&s;towed upon us, that we &s;hould be called the &s;ons of</HI> GOD, <HI>and if a &s;on then an heir of</HI> GOD <HI>through</HI> CHRIST. It is true, we have been captivated and alienated from our owners, to whom we belonged by right of heir&s;hip; and in our alienated e&s;tate have been guilty of breach of law, which <HI>cur&s;es every one that continues not in all things written in the book of the law to do them.</HI> But prai&s;ed be his name, in his love and pity he hath redeemed us from our captivity, and <HI>hath delivered us from the cur&s;e of the law being made a cur&s;e for us;</HI> there|fore we are his by purcha&s;e, for he hath purcha|&s;ed eternal redemption for us. In &s;hort, if Je&s;us had not been made of God unto us wi&s;dom, righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and redemption&mdash;if he had not been the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s, repen|tance would have been to no purpo&s;e; we &s;hould have found no place for repentance, though we had &s;ought it ever &s;o carefully with tears! for God who changeth not, had pledged his truth, that the &s;oul that &s;inned &s;hould die.&mdash;But we are told that tho&s;e &s;peak &s;mooth things who tell us that the go&s;pel is a proclamation of peace and good tidings. As the Holy Gho&s;t foretold by the
<PB N="6" REF="034685_0006_0FFF65F5402BB768">evangelical prophet, that the go&s;pel would be &s;ay|ing, <HI>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that publi&s;heth peace, that bringeth glad tidings of good&mdash;that publi&s;heth &s;alvation; that &s;aith unto Sion thy God reigneth! thy watchmen &s;hall lift up the voice, with the voice together &s;hall they &s;ing, for they &s;hall &s;ee eye to eye when the Lord &s;hall bring again Sion. For the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jeru&s;alem. The Lord hath made bare his arm in the eyes of the nations; and all the ends of the earth &s;hall &s;ee the &s;alvation of our God.</HI> We are al&s;o told, that Je&s;us him&s;elf read in the &s;ynagogue of Nazareth, this pa&s;&s;age of the prophet E&s;aias, where it is written, <HI>The &s;pirit of the Lord is upon me, becau&s;e he hath anointed me to preach the go&s;pel to the poor; he hath &s;ent me to heal the bro|ken-hearted; to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of &s;ight to the blind; to &s;et at li|berty them that are brui&s;ed; to preach the accepta|ble year of the Lord</HI>&mdash;and he clo&s;ed the book, and began to &s;ay to them, this day is the &s;cripture ful|filling in your ears. But if any thing like this is now taught to be the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, we are told it is an ea&s;y religion&mdash;too ea&s;y to be true; even by tho&s;e who e&s;teem them&s;elves experienced chri&s;tians: It is, I &s;ay, called daubing with untem|pered mortar: As though no mortar would &s;atisfy them but what bears a &s;triking re&s;emblance to a &s;ort of mortar &s;ometimes u&s;ed in the ea&s;tern parts of the world, which mortar is called Bitumen, and with which the walls of ancient Babylon were cemented, as hi&s;torians tell us; which mor|tar is &s;o tempered as to be exceeding hard when dry: yet contains &s;o much &s;ulphureous matter that when fire is applied it will burn like pitch, and con&s;ume with inten&s;e heat. But &s;ince the walls of
<PB N="7" REF="034685_0007_0FFF65F7CD3CAFE8">the ancient literal Babylon were cemented with &s;ulphureous mortar, that the wall of the my&s;tical Babylon, of which the literal was a figure, &s;hould be cemented with mortar &s;trongly tempered with brim&s;tone or &s;ulphur, is no great wonder, e&s;pecial|ly when we con&s;ider that my&s;tical Babylon is the kingdom of Satan! which is the abomination of the earth.</P>
<P>MANKIND, &s;ince the fall of Adam, have pretty generally &s;hown an aver&s;ion to what they e&s;teem an ea&s;y religion. It was upon this principle that the vengeance of GOD was not to be averted, un|le&s;s they them&s;elves did &s;ome very great thing to appea&s;e his anger, to &s;atisfy his ju&s;tice, and to pro|cure his favours, which is a very natural conceit for a blind and timid mind. Accordingly we read that the prophets of Baal upon mount Carmel, when Elijah was pre&s;ent, not only called upon their god from morning till evening, but al&s;o leapt upon their altars, and cut them&s;elves with knives and lancets, till the blood ran down; thinking no doubt that their god would be moved with compa&s;&s;ion to them and graciou&s;ly an&s;wer them, when he &s;aw how hard and &s;evere a &s;ervice they offered him: this I am &s;ure was no ea&s;y religion, or any way plea&s;ant. Another deity was not to be approached by his followers except through a &s;tream of their own &s;ons and daughters blood, and none but the children they loved mo&s;t, could be accepted to pa&s;s through the fire for a &s;acrifice, to pacify Molock's rage. But I never heard any that profe&s;s chri&s;tianity applaud that religion for the hardne&s;s and &s;everity of the &s;ervices, though I think it mu&s;t appear indeed very hard and &s;evere to any that ever felt parental affection.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="034685_0008_0FFF65F9B6438678">
THE Jews, it &s;eems, were very much plea&s;ed with this hard religion, and quite &s;ick of the wor|&s;hip of JEHOVAH, it was &s;o ea&s;y, though an heavy yoke, and under the Jewi&s;h economy, when com|pared to the &s;ervice of love and gratitude which Chri&s;tianity recommends! But I think the &s;ame notion is very common among tho&s;e who profe&s;s chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>THE Papi&s;ts think that the Prote&s;tants have an ea&s;y religion, too loo&s;e and ea&s;y to be good; he does not take that pains the Papi&s;t does to re|concile his God to him: The Papi&s;t perhaps goes a long pilgrimage, walks barefoot with an hair cloth next his &s;kin; at certain times whips him|&s;elf &s;everely! and the more he afflicts his fle&s;h the more he plea&s;es and reconciles his god to him; as he &s;uppo&s;es his religion is an hard, &s;evere reli|gion, and therefore in his e&s;teem mu&s;t be the &s;a|fe&s;t.&mdash;When a man undergoes &s;o much to gain the good will of God, the Papi&s;t thinks he mu&s;t gain it;&mdash;ju&s;t &s;o among Prote&s;tants, they that make their religion the mo&s;t hard and pain|ful ta&s;k, think with a plea&s;ing reflection, that they have done &s;o much for God&mdash;or at lea&s;t been &s;uch faithful labourers in his &s;ervice, that they mu&s;t be more high in his e&s;teem, &s;o more &s;afe than others. Thus painful and indu&s;trious are men in general who have any zeal for the re|ligion they profe&s;s, to make out a wedding gar|ment of their own filthy rags. How much be|neath the dignity of the God of love, are all the&s;e notions!&mdash;It is true that God's law was viola|ted by us in our fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and we were all be|come objects of puni&s;hment: His ju&s;tice could by no means excu&s;e the guilty. But what could we do to rein&s;tate the honour of this law, and to
<PB N="9" REF="034685_0009_0FFF65FB747EB498">&s;atisfy his ju&s;tice&mdash;Nothing but &s;uffer the penalty of the law&mdash;eternal death! and then ju&s;tice would have been ever inflicting without ever being &s;atis|fied! But God who&s;e ways are as much above our ways, and his thoughts above our thoughts, as the heavens are high above the earth; in&s;tead of looking to us for &s;atisfaction, he provided an am|ple &s;atisfaction to his ju&s;tice in our own behalf. <HI>He &s;pared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all; that with him he might al&s;o freely give us all things!</HI> How infinitely noble was this!&mdash; It was an act indeed worthy of GOD, who is love! When the eternal God in the brightne&s;s of his glory, and tran&s;cendent wi&s;hes of his love, has made mercy, and the very truth of ju&s;tice to meet and embrace each other in his Son! &s;o that our &s;ins are no more forever;&mdash;how low and pitiful does every attempt of ours to appea&s;e his ju&s;tice now appear.</P>
<P>BUT after all that has been &s;aid, if no religion can be &s;afe but an hard one, that requires &s;omething very great &amp; &s;evere to plea&s;e the Almighty, let it be taken notice of and remembered, that the religion which is accu&s;ed of being &s;o ea&s;y a way to heaven, points out the harde&s;t method of &s;atisfaction to divine ju&s;tice, and the mo&s;t co&s;tly manner of purcha&s;ing heaven for men, that the profe&s;&s;ors of any reli|gion ever thought of, even an infinite &s;atisfaction or infinite &s;acrifice! No le&s;s than the blood and agonies of the Son of God him&s;elf. One would think that this is a method of &s;atisfying ju&s;tice and procuring a title to heaven and eternal happine&s;s, &s;ufficiently hard to &s;atisfy any man in his &s;en&s;es. Mankind in general have had a notion that &s;ome great things mu&s;t be done; &s;ome hard or dear &s;a|crifice mu&s;t be made to God, to honour his ju&s;tice
<PB N="10" REF="034685_0010_0FFF6601D5455000">and procure a title to his favour and eternal happi|ne&s;s: and &s;o far as their knowledge extended they have judged very right in this particular, but then God him&s;elf has provided this great &s;omething, this dear &s;acrifice: he has been to us an infinite and everla&s;ting Father, has provided him&s;elf a lamb for a &s;acrifice, infinitely more dear and precious to him than all the wi&s;dom and ingenuity of the whole world could ever contrive. But after all this, men who think them&s;elves greatly &s;killed in divine knowledge, cry this will never do; we mu&s;t do &s;omething; if this is all, the ju&s;tice of God will never be &s;atisfied for us, we &s;hall never have a title to heaven if CHRIST's merits are not &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy ju&s;tice, even to the la&s;t mite, and to purcha&s;e for us an eternal inheritance in heaven! then <HI>Chri&s;t is dead in vain, and our preaching is vain, your faith al&s;o is vain, ye are yet in your &s;ins, then they al&s;o which are fallen a&s;leep in Chri&s;t are peri&s;hed,</HI> and Chri&s;t never ro&s;e again for our ju&s;tification, nor purcha&s;ed eternal redemption for us; though St. Paul expre&s;sly &s;ays he did. Heb, ix. 12. <HI>By his own blood he entred once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</HI></P>
<P>BUT only figure to your&s;elf a poor criminal confined in irons for trea&s;on again&s;t his king, condemned by a fair and righteous trial, of a ju&s;t and equitable &s;entence of death pronounced upon him: The king &s;ays to his &s;on, let us procure a relea&s;e for this poor criminal; &s;uch an one as &s;hall be con&s;i&s;tent with &s;trict ju&s;tice and the highe&s;t honour of the law&mdash;the prince, the king's &s;on, re|plies, I am ready and rejoice to do thy will. The &s;on goes, even to the pri&s;on, and there pays down an immen&s;e &s;um for the ran&s;om of the pri&s;oner, even before his eyes, and al&s;o procures, he purcha&s;es
<PB N="11" REF="034685_0011_0FFF66046B770F58">for him an ample and clear deed to a mo&s;t elegant hou&s;e in the city and a plentiful maintenance for life! The prince &s;teps up to the poor forlorn criminal, with all the chearful benevolence that could po&s;&s;ibly adorn the mo&s;t lovely per&s;on of a man, and knocks the irons off the pri&s;oner, and delivers him his pardon, &s;igned and &s;ealed, acknowledged and recorded, to an elegant &s;eat, and plentiful maintenance for life in the royal city! at the &s;ame time pulls off his dirty, grea&s;y, vile rags with which he was covered, and clothes him with a new, rich and beautiful, neat and clean robe, and &s;ays to him in the mo&s;t obliging man|ner you are heartily welcome to my father's pre|&s;ence and mine, to your elegant hou&s;e and fortune and to all the privileges of the royal city. The poor pri&s;oner not a little coufu&s;ed, looks round him! &mdash;carefully picks up his old clothes which in|&s;tead of being worth any thing, are a vile and abominable nui&s;ance, and &s;ays to the prince, I mu&s;t do &s;omething for the king your father, otherwi&s;e I &s;hall never get clear of the gallows after all, nor &s;ee the fine hou&s;e you tell of: I have nothing in the world to give the king but the&s;e old clothes, there are &s;ome &s;pots of dirt and grea&s;e upon them I con|fe&s;s, but as you take them home you will be &s;o good as to wa&s;h out the&s;e &s;pots before you pre&s;ent them to your father: there are a few rents and holes too in them I think, but you can carefully darn them up &s;o curiou&s;ly, and where it is wanted &s;et in here and there a new piece of cloth &s;o neatly that they will never be &s;een; this you will do too be|fore you pre&s;ent them! I wi&s;h I had &s;omething better to pre&s;ent to your father, he is an excellent king, but this is the be&s;t, nay all that I have.&mdash;The prince, with an air of kindne&s;s nobly &s;hining in his

THUS, however firmly men are a&s;&s;ured that CHRIST has purcha&s;ed eternal redemption for them, and &s;ecured their title to heaven, yet talk of conditions, and in&s;i&s;t upon doing &s;omething to get a title! even tho&s;e who cry out again&s;t works have this &s;omething to do to gain a title to happi|ne&s;s, as well as others, though they are careful to call that &s;omething they have to do by a different name from works! But what &s;ays the Almighty to the prophet I&s;aiah, <HI>He that killeth an ox is as if he &s;lew a man: he that &s;acrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered &s;wine's blood; he that burneth incen&s;e, as if he ble&s;&s;ed an idol.</HI>&mdash;Thus far is any thing that we our&s;elves can do from purcha&s;ing for us a title to the favour of GOD or an inheritance in his king|dom. &mdash;Every attempt of this kind we make, is no better than a &s;moke in the no&s;e of our GOD.</P>
<P>To the &s;ame purpo&s;e is the 10th chapter of St. Paul's epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, <HI>It is not po&s;&s;ible,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that the blood of bulls or of goats &s;hould take away &s;ins: wherefore when he cometh into the world, he &s;aith, the &s;on of God &s;aith to his Father, Sacrifice and offering thou woulde&s;t not, but a body haft thou prepared me: in burnt-offerings and &s;acri|fices for &s;in thou ha&s;t had no plea&s;ure: Then &s;aid I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, OGod. Above when he &s;aid, Sacri|fice, &amp;c. thou woulde&s;t not, neither had&s;t plea&s;ure therein, which are offered by the law.</HI> By the way don't you imagine that the Jews thought that GOD had plea&s;ure in tho&s;e &s;acrifices of theirs, which were offered by the law? Then &s;aid he, <HI>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God: By the which will, we are &s;anctified through the offering of the body of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, once for all,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle. Je&s;us

<P>1&s;t. What is meant by this expre&s;&s;ion in the text,&mdash;Wages.&mdash;<HI>The Wages of Sin is Death.</HI></P>
<P>WAGES are what is due to any one for what he does, what he de&s;erves either of reward or pun|i&s;hment. &mdash;The payment of what any one has mer|ited, and what he is &s;uppo&s;ed to expect, commonly in con&s;equence either of a promi&s;e or threatening.</P>
<P>WAGES are generally &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from a pre-contract: this is the ca&s;e here. The law of GOD is called a covenant of Works; con&s;i&s;ting of promi&s;es of life and happine&s;s, as the reward of obedience; and threatenings of death and mi&s;ery, as
<PB N="17" REF="034685_0017_0FFF6612854409A8">the puni&s;hment of di&s;obedience. <HI>He that docth tho&s;e things &s;hall live in them,</HI> &s;ays the law. <HI>If he keep all my &s;tatutes and do that which is lawful and right he &s;hall &s;urely live; in his righteou&s;ne&s;s that he hath done fe &s;hall live: But behold,</HI> &s;aith the LORD GOD, <HI>all</HI> SOULS <HI>are mine, the</HI> SOUL <HI>that</HI> SINNETH <HI>it &s;hall</HI> DIE: <HI>in the day thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;hall &s;urely die,</HI> &s;aith the LORD GOD to Adam.&mdash;And again, <HI>the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the righteous &s;hall be upon him:</HI> Thus you &s;ee the Wages of the righteous are al&s;o denounced to them by the law; the &s;oul that &s;inneth &s;hall die, for the wages of &s;in is death. Such are the Wages of &s;in, and ju&s;tice never &s;uf|fers them to go unpaid! Another thing to be con|&s;idered in Wages is, that they become due at a cer|tain period of time; and this time is commonly mentioned in the contract, if not, they are imme|diately due when merited.</P>
<P>THE law &s;ays, <HI>in the day thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;hall &s;urely die;</HI> and the giver of this law never had the character of refu&s;ing to pay labourers their Wages. <HI>Vengeance is mine &s;aith the</HI> LORD, <HI>I will repay.</HI> Nor had he ever ju&s;tly the charac|ter of withholding any part of the Wages: <HI>'Till heaven and earth pa&s;s away, one jot or one tittle &s;hall in no wi&s;e pa&s;s from the law till all be fulfilled</HI> &s;ays JESUS CHRIST. And again, <HI>if thou be ca&s;t into pri&s;on, verily I &s;ay unto thee, thou &s;halt by no means come out thence till thou ha&s;t paid the utter|mo&s;t farthing!</HI> In another Evangeli&s;t, <HI>the la&s;t mite!</HI> So that you may be &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured of this, that no one ever merited any kind of Wages of GOD, either of reward or puni&s;hment, that ever was or ever will be defrauded of any part of them, even the lea&s;t mite; for it is written, <HI>the recompen&s;e of a man's hands &s;hall be rendered unto him:</HI> for he is
<PB N="18" REF="034685_0018-0FFF6614E2BA3A70">faithful that hath promi&s;ed, and will bring it to pa&s;s; he is a ju&s;t God, he is a God of truth: you may indeed rely upon his word; he won's alter the thing that is gone out of his mouth.</P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to the 2d thing propo&s;ed, which was to examine, what is meant in the text by Sin.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle John tells us that all unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s is &s;in; and that who&s;oever committeth &s;in, tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth the law, for &s;in is the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law. And Je&s;us him&s;elf tells us, that the fir&s;t great Commandment in the Law is, <HI>thou &s;hall love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind: and the &s;econd is like unto it: thou &s;hall love thy neighbours as thy&s;elf: on the&s;e two commandments, hang all the law and the prophets.</HI> Hence it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that whatever there is in us, that is in any re&s;pect incon|&s;i&s;tent with loving God with all our hearts, or any neglect of loving our neighbour as our&s;elves, is &s;in, if we prefer any per&s;onal plea&s;ure or per&s;onal &s;afety, to doing (his) GOD's will; or if we at any time love our&s;elves better than our neigh|bours, we com|mit &s;in.&mdash;If we have any de&s;ire that our neigh|bours &s;hould meet with any trouble or difficulty; or take any degree of plea&s;ure in the &s;ufferings of any one, or attempt to injure any one, tho' in the &s;malle&s;t degree, whatever provocation he offers us, we commit &s;in! the certain wages of which is death.&mdash;What! &s;ays one, the lea&s;t offence po&s;&s;ible the mo&s;t trifling mi&s;conduct puni&s;hed with death! Yes&mdash;Is this certain? Indeed it is, it is not &s;aid the Wages of great &s;ins is death but not of little ones: The law cur&s;es every one that continueth not in all things contained in the law.&mdash;But, all things! I thought &s;ays one, that he who commits murder, or bla&s;phemy, or &s;ome &s;uch capital crime, and did
<PB N="19" REF="034685_0019_0FFF661B02D8E990">not repent, was entitled to death, but that every offence, even the &s;malle&s;t, would incur death, is what I did imagine no one believed; does any af|firm that every offence, even the lea&s;t, merits &s;o &s;evere a condemnation as Death!&mdash;What &s;aith the Scripture, <HI>He that offends in one point is guilty of all.</HI> I &s;hould think, continues he, that the infinite kind|ne&s;s and clemency of GOD would rather overlook petty faults, than thus heavily puni&s;h them.&mdash;No, we are plainly told that GOD will by no means clear the guilty: but for every idle word which men &s;peak, &s;hall they give account in the day of judgment!&mdash;What then will become of us all, &s;ays he, by &s;uch doctrine? for there is not a man in the world without his faults.&mdash;True, we are told plainly that <HI>there is not a man that liveth and &s;inneth not; in many things we offend all,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle; and my doctrine is not mine but the word of GOD.&mdash;But what is to be done with us all? &s;ays the man: what will become of us?&mdash;Why ju&s;t what the Word of GOD &s;ays, <HI>By the deeds of the law &s;hall no fte&s;h be ju&s;tified in his &s;ight, for every mouth &s;hall be &s;topped and the whole world become guilty before</HI> GOD. See Rom. iii. 19. They &s;hall be all proved guilty of &s;in; and the wages of &s;in it death.&mdash;I thought, &s;ays the man, here you was preaching up the &s;alvation of all men, but now you &s;eem to be preaching up the damnation of all men! This is explaining the law which many think to be a very principal part of preaching the go&s;pel of peace: This is &s;howing the condemna|tion of all men by the law; for we are plainly told of the law that it is a mini&s;tration of death; but do none e&s;cape this death which is the wages of &s;in; do none e&s;cape this condemnation?&mdash;Not one of all the race of Adam, for they have all &s;in|ned!
<PB N="20" REF="034685_0020_0FFF661CA36C67B8">And we are told that the whole world &s;hall become guilty before GOD, and we are told that he will by no means clear the guilty!&mdash;Wor&s;e and wor&s;e &s;ays the man: I think, &s;ays he, the mortar you daub with is tempered as high with brim|&s;tone as any body's; nay more &s;o, for I don't hear that you clear any, but condemn all the world! The mo&s;t cen&s;otious be&s;ides you, leave at lea&s;t room enough to creep out them&s;elves, but you don't do that!&mdash;No, we think with the apo&s;tles, <HI>are we better than they? no in no wi&s;e,</HI> for the &s;cripture hath concluded all under &s;in: But to be plain with you, &s;ays he, don't you think that &s;o much as one of the human race will finally be &s;aved? The an&s;wer to this que&s;tion will be mo&s;t &s;ea&s;ona|ble and perhaps fall in its proper place, when we con&s;ider the latter part of the words of the text.</P>
<P>I THINK, &s;ays he, you have at this time, preach|ed up the law &s;trict enough for any body&mdash;indeed tho&s;e of your way of thinking, though they don't incline to preach very much upon the law, yet when they take it in hand they make thorough work of it, meaning, I &s;uppo&s;e to do this piece of work &s;o effectually that it &s;han't need to be taken in hand &s;o often. For my part &s;ays he, I had ra|ther have more of the law preach'd, but then I would chu&s;e to have it a little more mild; for I don't after all &s;ee why the law mayn't ju&s;tify, or at lea&s;t excu&s;e tho&s;e who hone&s;tly mean to keep the law, though they often break it, through infir|mity or &s;urpri&s;e, or ignorance, or through want of con&s;ideration! but if they try to do as well as they can, and are &s;incere and habitually obedient and lament their back&s;lidings, it looks hard in|deed that they &s;han't be accepted: &s;urely the law of God can't be &s;o rigid. When a man has done
<PB N="21" REF="034685_0021_0FFF661E701A8788">as well as he can, he can't do any better; and what would you have him do? I an&s;wer in the words of the great apo&s;tle to the Gentiles, <HI>If there had been a law given which would have given life, verily righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hould have been by the law, but the &s;cripture hath concluded all under &s;in.</HI>&mdash;Says he, and you know the wages of &s;in is death.&mdash;How fond are people of trying to make the law a mi|ni&s;tration of life; how many attempts to mitigate the &s;everity of it: though after all it will look them in the face, and make them afraid, as long as they &s;eek to be ju&s;tified by it: however they take great pains to &s;mooth the terrors of it, and to ex|plain away the &s;everity of it, the Wages of Sin is Death; e&s;pecially great acts of &s;in, they imagine; if they be not repented of, but continued in.&mdash; No, the law condemns them if they are guilty of but one breach of it! For he that offends in one point, we are told, is guilty of all! and cur&s;ed, if he continues not in all things written in the book to do them, but they will endeavour to get clear of all tho&s;e plain and &s;tubborn declarations by a&s;&s;erting that they don't mean as they &s;ay, and &s;o take for doctrines the commandments of men, making void the law of God through their tradi|tions, as we are told the Jews did. This they do becau&s;e they &s;ee no way of e&s;caping the &s;entence of the law, but by mitigating the &s;trictne&s;s and &s;e|verity, and by making the law more pliable, for they mu&s;t at all events, contrive &s;ome way them|&s;elves of living excu&s;ed by the law, &s;ince the law|giver has plainly told them; that he will by no means clear the guilty. See Exod, xxxiv. 7. <HI>But the &s;oul that &s;inneth &s;hall die.</HI> See Ezekiel 18th chap. But to avoid being &s;lain by the law, men will &s;eek out many inventions. I was alive to the law once
<PB N="22" REF="034685_0022_0FFF6621B2539738">&s;ays St. Paul. He could find out how he might be ju&s;tified, or at lea&s;t excu&s;ed by it; but when the commandments came &s;ays he, it appear'd in its true light, exceeding broad; &s;in revived and I died, he &s;aw him&s;elf condemned to death by the law, the &s;lighte&s;t &s;ins in the e&s;teem of men are notwith|&s;tanding mortal in the &s;ight of GOD, as they are devi|ations from the rules of equity and righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is ab&s;urd to conceive that man, created in the image of God, and bound by every tie of alle|giance to be &s;ubject and obedient to his infinite Cicator. It is wretchedly ab&s;urd to conceive, that in the&s;e circum&s;tances, man &s;hould &s;in at all and not be puni&s;hed; to &s;in venially as the Papi&s;ts call it, &s;o &s;lightly as that GOD will put up with it without puni&s;hing it, is not to &s;in at all, the very pretence is a contradiction; for every &s;in is noth|ing el&s;e: Even the lea&s;t &s;in that ever was commit|ted is nothing le&s;s than the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law! and therefore incurs the penalty of the law, which penalty is death, the cur&s;e. Con&s;equently by &s;in, the text means all manner and degrees of &s;in, none of which are venial, but all give us a &s;ure title to death. The tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law of God, even the lea&s;t of them, do far more ju&s;tly merit death than the greate&s;t oftenders again&s;t the law of man, the dignity of our divine law-giver, and the obli|gations both of right and gratitude to him are pro|digious aggravations to the &s;ins we commit again&s;t the precepts and commands of our &s;upreme &s;ove|reign, for who can expre&s;s the infinite di&s;proportion there is between us and him? Are not we his creatures, the work of his hands, and has he not a full right and unlimited property in us? Where|fore are not our oftences again&s;t him, yea, the lea&s;t of them, &s;ufficiently provoking and criminal to
<PB N="23" REF="034685_0023_0FFF6626C9AF7248">de&s;erve death? Undoubtedly they are! They give us a &s;ure infallible title to death, which is denoun|ced in many other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, as well as my text, to be the ju&s;t reward and appointed wa|ges of &s;ins.</P>
<P>BUT I pa&s;s on to examine in the 3d place, WHAT is meant in the text by Death, that death which all &s;in has a &s;ure title to.&mdash;Death in its utmo&s;t limits, no doubt contains every thing that is in any mea&s;ure grievous or de&s;tructive, either to &s;oul or body: Thus Pharaoh be&s;ought Mo&s;es to intreat the LORD his GOD that he would take away this death, only alluding to the Locu&s;ts that had over&s;pread the country, and eat up every herb which the hail had left.</P>
<P>So St. Paul &s;ays, he was in deaths oft; and this be&s;ides, the different views he had, that the law condemned to death; it was the &s;tripes and labours and impri&s;onments, with that long cata|logue of troubles he endured, which be&s;ides their pre&s;ent pain, tended evidently to the temporal de&s;truction of his body: And &s;o upon that account are perhaps &s;tiled &s;o many di&s;tinct deaths, or ra|ther degrees of death! But the death of the body is completed in its ab&s;olute &s;eparation from the &s;oul in its di&s;&s;olution! Death al&s;o comprehends all the darkne&s;s, terrors and afflictions of the mind, all that remor&s;e and inward di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion of &s;oul which are the con&s;equences of &s;in, and every painful idea that ari&s;es from a &s;en&s;e of guilt and the fear of puni&s;hment. All the guilt, di&s;tre&s;s, darkne&s;s and fears of the &s;oul are its death; this is &s;piritual death, or the death of the &s;oul, thus de|nounced by the law; the &s;oul that &s;inneth &s;hall die; this death of the &s;oul or &s;pirit is called &s;pi|ritual death.&mdash;When it is complete in an ab&s;olute
<PB N="24" REF="034685_0024_0FFF66285B727958">and perfect &s;eparation and ce&s;&s;ation from every kind and degree of hope, com&s;ort or any thing plea&s;ing, it is the very blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s in the mind, and the compleat angui&s;h of di&s;tre&s;s and horror! not admitting the lea&s;t view of divine fa|vour, or the lea&s;t degree of &s;en&s;e of the beauty of holine&s;s, a perfect deadne&s;s to all goodne&s;s, righ|teou&s;ne&s;s or happine&s;s, and a continuance in this &s;tate forever, is eternal death, the wages of &s;in!</P>
<P>A MAN is &s;aid to be dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins in the language of &s;cripture, when he is devoted to the &s;ervice of &s;in, and &s;ees him&s;elf condemned by the law, and is ignorant of the &s;alvation of GOD, has no reli&s;h for holine&s;s; but his mind, dead to every thing &s;piritually good, his mind is under the the &s;entence of the law, which is death; like a cri|minal &s;entenced to death by human laws, who knows of no certain way to e&s;cape the execution threatened, that he may have &s;ome flattering hopes, that &s;eem to bewilder without rea&s;on or foundation.</P>
<P>THOSE who are dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, fre|quently feel much &s;orrow and inward heavine&s;s at times. When evil accidents befal them, they are often alarmed: particularly when &s;ickne&s;s threat|ens them, it is not uncommon for them to be in great dread, fearing that a &s;ummons is &s;ent to call them to that impartial reckoning, in which the Devil and their own guilty minds will prove ac|cu&s;ers; in this &s;tate of fearful expectation, the in|ce&s;&s;ant clamour of an enraged con&s;cience mu&s;t be di&s;tre&s;&s;ing beyond expre&s;&s;ion! how extreme the agonies of a guilty mind. If we had never felt any thing of this kind, by experience it would be difficult if not impo&s;&s;ible to paint the &s;everity of them. We could not figure to our&s;elves, if we were utter &s;trangers to them, how &s;ad, how &s;evere
<PB N="25" REF="034685_0025_0FFF5A21F6A29A50">and in&s;upportably gloomy they are many times, va&s;tly wor&s;e than a temporal death: and &s;ometimes put the mi&s;erable object upon the project of forc|ing them&s;elves out of the world to avoid them. However, the&s;e guilty agonies are a &s;ad, though lively figure of &s;piritual eternal death, the wages of &s;in; which after as many thou&s;ands, as many millions of ages of years, as there are &s;ands on the &s;ea &s;hore or atoms in this whole globe of earth, is no nearer a period or conclu&s;ion than at the fir&s;t moment of its beginning. The&s;e are the wages of every &s;in, even of the lea&s;t that was ever com|mitted again&s;t the law of God: It de&s;erves death, temporal and &s;piritual; the death both of the body and &s;oul, and this death to remain forever: to be without end or intermi&s;&s;ion. I need not un|dertake a particular proof of this duration of death, bodily and &s;piritual, and eternal, being the &s;entence of the law of GOD for fin; for I think it is even a common phra&s;e, that &s;in de&s;erves and is threat|ened with death, temporal, &s;piritual and eternal.</P>
<P>THE law that denounces the wages of &s;in to be death, gives not even the lea&s;t hint or intimation of any ce&s;&s;ation or relea&s;e from that death! &s;o that would we know what is meant in the text by that death which is the wages of &s;in, we mu&s;t form in our minds a compleated apprehen&s;ion of all ill, of all the pains and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the body, together with its &s;eparation from the &s;oul, its utter di&s;&s;olu|tion, and of all the extreme agonies of the &s;oul, with|out one &s;park of joy or hope, for an eternal dura|tion; and then con&s;ider that this is the &s;entence of GOD's law upon every &s;on and daughter of Adam, for St. Paul tells us plainly that the &s;cripture hath concluded all under &s;in; there is none of them righteous; no not one&mdash;in many things we offend
<PB N="26" REF="034685_0026_0FFF6629F3336818">all: and le&s;t we &s;hould try to excu&s;e &s;ome, we are told that by the offence of Adam, judgment came upon all men to condemnation.&mdash;I hope that none who hear me &s;hall think that I am faulty, for not preaching up the terrors of the law.</P>
<P>IF any of you are fond of what &s;ome term law works, I think they mu&s;t be &s;atisfied, for to declare, as I do, that every, even the lea&s;t offence again&s;t the law of GOD, merits the death of &s;oul and body to all eternity, and that all the evils we can conceive of as pertaining to the man, forever are to be taken into this idea of death:&mdash; and that all the natural de&s;cendants of Adam, without exception have been proved guilty and &s;entenced to this death by the law, and that no one jot or tittle of this law could ever fail or be excu&s;ed from taking effect, is, I think, preaching the law &s;trict enough for any body.</P>
<P>YE that talk of keeping the law or obeying the commands of GOD, in order to be &s;aved by it, what do you think of it? I know that this method of preaching the law mu&s;t be &s;trict enough for you.&mdash; Perhaps &s;ome one might make this reply, I know that by the deeds of the law no fle&s;h &s;hall be ju&s;|tified in his GOD's &s;ight, but then if I believe and repent, and &s;trive to keep the commandments of GOD, and do generally, and habitually keep them, I expect that CHRIST will &s;atisfy for tho&s;e in&s;tan|ces in which I fail of my duty.&mdash;Then you &s;up|po&s;e that a new piece of cloth put into an old gar|ment won't make the rent wor&s;e, though CHRIST was of opinion that it would: You think then that a garment, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome old cloth and &s;ome new, if joined together, will make a perfect garment, fit to appear in before an infinitely ju&s;t GOD! But it &s;eems that JESUS him&s;elf is not wil|ling
<PB N="27" REF="034685_0027_0FFF662E22B67980">to put a piece of his new cloth into our old gar|ment, becau&s;e he judges that it will make the rent wor&s;e! for the new cloth won't fa&s;ten to the old nor by any means adhere to it;&mdash;the old would break away in the attempt. And if it would ad|here, the garment after all would be but a patch'd thing, and would not look like the coat of JESUS, which we are told was <HI>without &s;eam, woven from the top throughout, and not &s;uffered to be rent even by the &s;oldiers.</HI> John xix. 23. And though his body was pierced and his blood poured out, yet his &s;eamle&s;s coat was by no man rent: therefore you have &s;uf|ficient a&s;&s;urances that Je&s;us will never tare up his &s;eamle&s;s coat to patch your's; be&s;ides, a patch'd coat would hardly look like a wedding garment. So that it is very plain that you mu&s;t fail in that attempt.</P>
<P>ST. Paul never made any mention in any of his epi&s;tles, of mending our old garment with &s;lips or pieces of CHRIST'S new robe of righteou&s;ne&s;s!&mdash; He exhorts indeed to <HI>put off the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lu&s;ts; and to put on the new man, which after God is created in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s.</HI> Eph. iv. 22-24. Ob&s;erve, my brethren, the apo&s;tle don't &s;ay, put off part of the old man which is partly corrupt, according to the lu&s;ts that are partly deceitful, nor put on &s;ome little part of the new man, which is partly created in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s.</P>
<P>ST. Paul &s;ays to the Colo&s;ians, chap. iii. ver&s;es 9, 10, and &s;o on, <HI>Ye have put off the old man with his deeds: and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: where</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumci&s;ion nor uncircumci&s;ion, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free:</HI> no part of the old man
<PB N="28" REF="034685_0028_0FFF6632A16B9290">remaining: but &s;ays he, <HI>Chri&s;t is all and in all.</HI> Take notice that the apo&s;tle don't &s;ay, that CHRIST is part and in part of all, but, CHRIST <HI>is all and in all.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, &s;ays the objector, Do you agree with the doctrine of the church of England in this matter, and her interpretation of &s;cripture concerning this doctrine, that no part of our old garments, or righ|teou&s;ne&s;s can be accepted in GOD's &s;ight? as com|ing up to the demands of the law, the church of England in her articles of Religion has &s;et to her &s;eal that it is true.&mdash;Article 13th.&mdash;Works done before the grace of Chri&s;t, and the in&s;piration of his &s;pirit, are not done as GOD hath willed and commanded them to be done; no doubt but they have the nature of &s;in;&mdash;but this, &s;ays the objector, condemns but only part of our works, and tho&s;e too which are before the grace of CHRIST and the in&s;piration of his &s;pirit; but does not at all con|demn as defective, tho&s;e works of ours which are the fruits of faith in CHRIST, which proceed from a true and lively faith. This is but a poor way of proving that the whole of any thing is condemned as defective becau&s;e &s;ome part of it is. Well then, let us examine the 12th article in which are the&s;e words: Albeit that good works which are the fruits of faith, and follow after ju&s;tification, cannot put away our &s;ins and endure the &s;everity of GOD's judgment. Here then you &s;ee that the articles of the church of England condemn our works, both before and after faith, as defective; even tho&s;e that are the fruits of faith cannot endure the &s;everity of GOD's judgment: though in the clo&s;e of this 12th article they are &s;aid to &s;pring out nece&s;&s;arily of a true and lively faith, in&s;omuch that by them a live|ly faith may be as evidently known as a tree di&s;|cerned by its fruit. This, &s;ays the objector, has
<PB N="29" REF="034685_0029_0FFF663430BF7A18">a plau&s;ible appearance of condemning all we do as defective in the &s;ight of GOD's law, I mu&s;t own; but yet I cannot think, that the church of England ever meant to condemn them all as defective: I think they could not.&mdash;Well, let as examine further then; article 11th has the&s;e words, We are accounted righteous before GOD only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST, for &s;ays the 18th article, Holy &s;cripture doth &s;et out unto us only the name of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> whereby men mu&s;t be &s;aved. Thus fully has the church of England &s;et her &s;eal to the truth of this doctrine, and I feel happy that my following the exact truth of &s;cripture in this point, and clo&s;ely adhering to it, does not expo&s;e me to any ju&s;t im|putation of departing from the doctrine of the church of England. But I may freely declare that no works of ours whatever from our birth to our death will &s;tand the &s;trict te&s;t of righteou&s;ne&s;s in the fight of GOD, or bear the impartial exami|nation of his ju&s;tice, and let us de&s;ire with St. Paul, <HI>to be found in Chri&s;t not having our own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the law, but the righteou&s;ne&s;s of</HI> GOD, <HI>and that we may know him and the power of his re|&s;urrection, who rofe from the dead for our ju&s;lification.</HI></P>
<P>THE law was given by Mo&s;es, and was a mini|&s;tration of death; but grace and truth came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and though the letter killeth yet the &s;pirit giveth life. My words, or the words I &s;peak unto you, &s;aid Je&s;us, are &s;pirit, and they are life. We are told the fir&s;t man Adam was made a living &s;oul, the la&s;t Adam was made a quickning &s;pirit: had it not been for &s;in, man might have lived pro&s;|perous and happy in an earthly paradi&s;e:&mdash;his life, free from cares and unmixed with &s;orrow. Sin fir&s;t made man acquainted with trouble, and it is
<PB N="30" REF="034685_0030_0FFF66386318BDC0">our guiltine&s;s of mind, under a &s;en&s;e of the law, that increa&s;es the number and heightens the ma|lignity of all our afflictions. It is the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of our manifold &s;ins, and the dread of Al|mighty vengeance, in minds de&s;titute of the light of life, that arms the di&s;a&s;ters of the world with &s;uch a killing force, and &s;ometimes makes the load of temporal evils too heavy for men to bear, when the mind &s;eems the only part immediately effected. When men have lively notions of the terrors of wickedne&s;s, what is it but only this one evil that can indeed wound their &s;pirit with trembling con|cern, and the mo&s;t cutting angui&s;h; and would they not think it a happy deliverance to be &s;et free from that dreadful bondage to fear, which has made many go into a compleat de&s;truction, and many to cut their own throats, to drown their &s;en&s;e of the fear of eternal death, the wages of &s;in, in a deluge of their own blood! Would not they who are tormented with &s;uch outrageous fear, think it a ble&s;&s;ed deliverance, now to be &s;aved from it?&mdash; and like the man that was among the tombs, to be &s;et calm and in their right mind at JESUS' feet?&mdash; Would they not think it of &s;ome benefit to man now to have the go&s;pel of peace proclaimed, tho' it was repre&s;ented as good tidings of great joy which &s;hall be to all people.</P>
<P>BUT to &s;hew what is an effectual deliverance now from this awful bondage to fears, belongs to the con&s;ideration of the remaining part of my text, which I hope will be the matter of our agreeable contemplation at a future opportunity.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing heretofore on the&s;e words, I propo&s;ed to examine di&s;tinctly,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. What is meant by Wages:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. What is meant by Sin:</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. What is meant by Death:</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. What is meant by the Gift of GOD:</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. What is meant by eternal Life: and,</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. What is meant by the a&s;&s;ertion that this eternal Life is in CHRIST JESUS our LORD.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>THE fir&s;t three of the&s;e I have carefully con&s;i|dered; and &s;hewn that Wages are that which is due either of reward or puni&s;hment: to every one according to what they have done: the payment of what every one merits by the tenure of the di|vine law, which is a covenant of works, con&s;i&s;ting of promi&s;es of life and happine&s;s for the reward of unfailing obedience, and of threatnings of death and mi&s;ery for the puni&s;hment of every in&s;tance, for every kind and degree, of di&s;obedience: he that doth the things contained in the law, &s;hall live in them, but the &s;oul that &s;inneth &s;hall die, &s;ays the law, and that GOD never did nor ever will defraud any of their wages, not even of the lea&s;t farthing of
<PB N="32" REF="034685_0032_0FFF663D91B38E20">them, but the recompence of a man's hands &s;hall be rendered unto him. Secondly, I &s;how'd what was meant by Sin, that all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;in, every in&s;tance, in thought, word or deed, that is contrary to or not fully up to loving GOD with all the heart, and our neighbours as our&s;elves; and I proved by the mo&s;t plain and full te&s;timony of &s;cripture, that every one of the natural de&s;cendants of Adam are finners, and have merited the Wages of Sin, which is Death; that nothing which any one of them do from their birth to their death, comes fully up to the demands of the divine law, and that to this truth the church of England hath &s;et her &s;eal, particularly in her 11th, 12th, 13th and 18th articles of Religion. Thirdly, I &s;how'd what Death it is that is threatned to every one for the wages of &s;in: That it comprehends all the evils that can take hold either of body or mind; all the pains of the body together with its total di&s;&s;olution, and all the guilty agonics of the &s;oul, together with its compleat &s;eparation from every &s;park of joy or hope; and this &s;tare both of &s;oul and body to con|tinue for ever and ever; this is what is commonly called death, temporal, &s;piritual and eternal, and that by the holy and ju&s;t law of GOD, this &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon every &s;on and daughter of Adam, the &s;crip|ture having concluded all under &s;in, and that GOD, who is true, has declared that he will by no means clear the guilty. So that &s;ince the fall of Adam, it was never po&s;&s;ible that either he or any one of his de&s;cendents &s;hould e&s;cape this puni&s;hment, this cur&s;e, even death, the ju&s;t wages of &s;in: and though the law of GOD is holy, ju&s;t and good, yet to us it is no other than a mini&s;tration of death, as St. Paul expre&s;sly te&s;tifies.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="034685_0033_0FFF66404149B640">
THUS I have explained the law to you, and u&s;ed my endeavour, that no part of the truth of it &s;hould be kept back from you; and though upon the la&s;t interview I brought you no farther on your way than under the very centre of this dark cloud, the mini&s;tration of condemnation, and there left you for a little &s;pace, but not without an intima|tion that I purpo&s;ed to carry you farther, yet now I have met you here, to conduct you from the clouds of darkne&s;s and fear, to that great mountain which GOD by the mouth of his prophet Daniel, has promi&s;ed &s;hall fill the whole earth, where is fulne&s;s of light and joy, and though it is an e&s;tab|li&s;hed truth, that no one of the guilty race of Adam could e&s;cape the cur&s;e of the law which is death: but &s;entence of condemnation has pa&s;&s;ed upon all: for the word of GOD is &s;ure, yet I now come to you in the fullne&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel of peace, to te&s;tify to you in the words of the Holy Gho&s;t, delivered by the prophets I&s;aiah and Jeremith, that your warfare is accompli&s;hed, that you have receiv|ed double for all your &s;ins; the Lord has accom|pli&s;hed his fury; for as St. Paul te&s;tifies, <HI>Chri&s;t has appeared to put away &s;in by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf. I am come to declare unto you, that the gift of God is eternal life, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord.</HI> What a glo|rious light is this&mdash;the thunderings and lightnings, the clouds and thick darkne&s;s that over&s;hadow mount Sinai, with all their terrors, are di&s;per&s;ed, and the Son of Righteou&s;ne&s;s has ari&s;en with heal|ing in his wings.</P>
<P>I NOW come to the con&s;ideration of the 4th par|ticular in my text, to &s;how, What is meant by the Gi&s;t of GOD.</P>
<P>THE thing given, the apo&s;tle declares in my text to be, eternal life. St. John tells us, <HI>that God
<PB N="34" REF="034685_0034_0FFF66442E8E5D90">hath given to us eternal life; and this life is in his &s;on.</HI> See 1&s;t John, v. 11. The tradition of the world, &s;ays, that God will give eternal life to tho&s;e who now obey him, and believe the go&s;pel; but to none el&s;e; and to the believers God will not give eternal life, till the day of judgment! but we &s;ee the apo&s;tle of our Lord differs from this tradition of men. St. Paul in my text, does not &s;ay the gift of God will be eternal life &s;ometime or other; but he &s;ays, <HI>it is eternal life.</HI> And St. John &s;ays, <HI>God hath given to us eternal life:</HI> as already given, not as &s;omething to be given hereafter.&mdash;When GOD gave his Son, he gave us eternal life: They &s;peak of this eternal life as already given, not as &s;omething to be given hereafter. When GOD gave his Son, he gave us eternal life, for this life is his Son. And JESUS &s;aid, <HI>I am the way, the truth and the life. Ye are dead,</HI> (&s;ays St. Paul,) <HI>and your life is hid with Chri&s;t in God.</HI> And we are told that <HI>when he who is our life &s;hall appear, we &s;hall appear with him in glory!</HI> So that JESUS is &s;aid to be our life, becau&s;e he not only redeemed us from death, the wages of &s;in, but procured for us life by his obedience to the law; for life is the reward of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s by the law, and he is the head of every man; and being righteous for every man, becau&s;e he is the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him: For he,</HI> we are told, <HI>was made of God unto us wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and redemption.</HI> So that we being the righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD in him, have life, the reward of righteou&s;ne&s;s. We live becau&s;e he lives; he is the vine and we the branches: we received our life from him, he is the root that &s;upports us; the head of every man is CHRIST: We are expre&s;sly told, <HI>and if the head lives the whole body lives.</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="034685_0035_0FFF6646110E45A0">So that GOD'S giving his Son, includes the gift of eternal life to us; for we are expre&s;sly told, <HI>that this life is in his &s;on.</HI> Again, the gift of God is free; no purcha&s;e of ours: It is unconditional re&s;pecting us; no condition required but what CHRIST has already fulfilled. To give and then require of us to purcha&s;e the gift is beneath the dignity of our heavenly Father. No, the gift of GOD is free; for &s;ays St. Paul, in the 5th chapter of his epi&s;tle to the Romans, <HI>Not as the offence, &s;o al&s;o is the free gift. For it through the offence of one, many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, hath abounded unto many. And not as it was by one that &s;inned, &s;o is the gift: for the judg|ment was by one</HI> [i. e. one oftence,] <HI>to condemnation; but the free gift is of many offences unto ju&s;tification.</HI></P>
<P>BUT &s;ays the objector, We are exhorted to repent, therefore this is a condition of our receiving this gift. I an&s;wer, this gift is already given, GOD <HI>hath given to us eternal life,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle John. Yes, &s;ays the objector, he had given eternal life to them whom the apo&s;tle was talking to, for they had re|pented. I an&s;wer, St. Paul in his epi&s;tle to the Romans, chap. 11. ver&s;es 28, 29, &s;ays of the unbe|lieving, impenitent Jews, <HI>as touching the election, they are beloved for the Fathers &s;akes. For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. For</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that</HI> What? that he might damn them all? No; <HI>that he might have mercy upon all.</HI> So that if you will believe St. Paul, the gift of God is free and with|out repentance; nay, even tho&s;e who are conclud|ed in unbelief, as all the nations of the Jews were; were not the&s;e concluded unbelievers, that all, or even any one of them might peri&s;h, but that GOD might have mercy upon all of them&mdash;<HI>that our mer|ciful
<PB N="36" REF="034685_0036_0FFF664A5C8EA370">high prie&s;t might have compa&s;&s;ion upon the igno|rant, and tho&s;e that are out of the way,</HI> as the &s;ame apo&s;tle tells us in his epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, and though the Jews &s;tumbled at that &s;tumbling &s;tone, as it is written, <HI>Behold I lay in Zion a &s;tum|bling &s;tone and rock of offence, yet</HI> (&s;ays the apo&s;tle) <HI>have they &s;tumbled that they &s;hould fall, God forbid.</HI> Though they &s;tumbled, yet he abhorred the very idea of their being lo&s;t: no, it could not be; tho&s;e who &s;tumbled were to ri&s;e again; as God told Simeon, when he took up the child Je&s;us in his arms being in the temple, and the Holy Gho&s;t be|ing upon him, &s;ays to Mary the mother of Je&s;us, <HI>this child is &s;et for the fall and ri&s;ing again of many in I&s;rael.</HI> So that tho&s;e who &s;tumble or fall were however to ri&s;e again: &s;o that the more you exa|mine the go&s;pel of God's grace, the more plainly you will &s;ee that the gift of God is free&mdash;his grace is free&mdash;for God, we are told, <HI>commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet &s;inners, Chri&s;t died for us.</HI> He did not wait for our faith or re|pentance, no; <HI>when we were enemies, we were re|conciled to God by the death of his Son.</HI> See Rom. 8&amp;10. &mdash;<HI>And if this is by grace</HI> (St. Paul tells us) <HI>then it is no more of works: otherwi&s;e grace is no more grace&mdash;every one who believes in the true Chri&s;t, who is the head of every man:</HI> for we are told, <HI>there &s;hould be many fal&s;e Chri&s;ts, and that they &s;hould de|ceive many;</HI> but every one who believes in the trueChri&s;t, who, we are told <HI>is the &s;aviour of all men,</HI> will &s;ee that <HI>he is the end of the law for righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI> And if he is the end of the law, the law came to an end in him. The demands of the law fully an&s;wered and &s;atisfied by him, then what can be left for us to do to purcha&s;e this gift, which is al|ready given us? But if we have &s;omething to do to
<PB N="37" REF="034685_0037_0FFF664C514FE668">obtain this gift, then it is no longer a gift, much le&s;s a free gift, but a bargain. But &s;ays the objector, is not the go&s;pel called a covenant, &mdash;the new cove|nant; and better than the old covenant; and does not a covenant &s;uppo&s;e conditions to be performed? Yes, the go&s;pel of the grace of GOD is called the New Covenant, and GOD promi&s;ed by I&s;aiah, <HI>to give his &s;on for a covenant of the people.</HI> And as JESUS is our covenant&mdash;the covenant of the people, the conditions to be performed were all due from <HI>Je&s;us</HI> alone, and he has performed them &s;o that the covenant is fini&s;hed forever. Hence St. Paul calls the blood of JESUS, <HI>the blood of the everla&s;ting covenant.</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t covenant was broken by us, and &s;o came to an end. We being unfaithful GOD would tru&s;t us no more, but gave his Son for our covenant, which perfectly &s;ecured the performance of the conditions on our &s;ide; JESUS has already per|formed every tittle that was required: &s;o that it is not left in our power to break this covenant; it is already compleated, and &s;o mu&s;t la&s;t forever: therefore the blood of JESUS is &s;tiled <HI>the blood of the everla&s;ting covenant</HI>&mdash;the covenant that will la&s;t forever. <HI>The mountains &s;hall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindne&s;s &s;hall not depart from thee! neither &s;hall the covenant of my peace be re|moved, &s;aith the Lord, that bath mercy on thee: in a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everla&s;ting kindne&s;s will I have mercy on thee &s;aith the Lord thy redeemer:</HI> And every tongue that &s;hall ri&s;e again&s;t thee in judgment thou &s;halt condemn. This is the heritage of the &s;ervants of the Lord, and their righteou&s;ne&s;s is of me, &s;aith the Lord. See I&s;aiah xv. 8, 10, 17.

<P>Now &s;ays St. Paul, <HI>where remi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e is there is no more offering for &s;ins.</HI> But many think they have &s;till an offering to make; &s;ome condi|tions to perform; in order to fulfil their part of the covenant of grace, which if true, would make it a covenant of works as much as the fir&s;t cove|nant was, and then the new covenant might be broken by us; and then how would it be an ever|la&s;ting covenant&mdash;how would it be the &s;ure mercies of David. If it was left to us to keep or break, how would it be &s;ure at all? GOD has promi&s;ed that the covenant of his peace &s;hall not be remov|ed: Becau&s;e our righteou&s;ne&s;s is of him, it does not depend on our&s;elves, but our eternal life is the gift of GOD, we don't purcha&s;e it&mdash;for it is freely given.</P>
<P>GOD &s;ent his Son to redeem us&mdash;to &s;ulfil the law for us&mdash;to do every thing for us that was nece&s;&s;ary, in order to GOD's being ju&s;t, and at the &s;ame time the ju&s;tifier of the &s;inner.

This &s;acrifice alone was &s;ufficient without any of our doings, to put away the &s;ins of the whole world.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="034685_0039_0FFF66516086F338">
JSEUS was the lamb of GOD, that took away the &s;in of the world: <HI>that ta&s;ted death for every man; that gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all; that was made a cur&s;e for us; that was made &s;in for us; that fini&s;hed the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions and made an end of &s;in:</HI> for he is <HI>the propitiation for our &s;ins, and not for ours only,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>but for the &s;ins of the whole world.</HI></P>
<P>BUT &s;ays the objector, don't you depart from the doctrine of the church of England, when you &s;ay that the &s;acrifice of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> alone is &s;ufficient without any of our doings, to put away the &s;ins of the whole world. I remember, &s;ays he, that you undertook to prove upon a former occa&s;ion, that by the articles of the church of England, all our righteou&s;ne&s;s from our birth to our death, even the be&s;t of it, even that which proceeds from a true and lively faith, is defective, and will not &s;tand the te&s;t of GOD's ju&s;tice, or the &s;everity of his judg|ment; and you &s;eemed to have more to &s;ay for your&s;elf than one would have imagined; but when you a&s;&s;ert that CHRIST has already done all that is nece&s;&s;ary to reconcile the ju&s;tice of GOD to us, without any doings of our own, I don't &s;ee how you will prove that to be con&s;i&s;tent with the doc|trine of the church, that we have nothing left for us to do, to e&s;cape eternal death&mdash;the wages of &s;in, but that CHRIST has done all, Well then, let us hear the beginning of the prayer of con&s;ecration in the communion &s;ervice, which is this: "Almighty GOD, our heavenly Father, who of thy tender mer|cy did&s;t give thy only Son, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> to &s;uffer death upon the cro&s;s for our redemption, who made there (by his one oblation of him&s;elf once offered) a full, perfect and &s;ufficient &s;acrifice, ob|lation and &s;atisfaction for the &s;ins of the whole world!"&mdash;What can be more expre&s;s than this? If CHRIST's death upon the cro&s;s, is a full, perfect
<PB N="40" REF="034685_0040_0FFF6656C9F54D18">and &s;ufficient &s;atisfaction for the &s;ins of the whole world, what can infinite ju&s;tice do more? Would it be ju&s;t to require more than what is a full, per|fect and &s;ufficient &s;atisfaction to ju&s;tice? But &s;ays the objector, I can't think that this was meant to exclude our faith, repentance, and all our obedi|ence from being nece&s;&s;ary to &s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of GOD: &s;o that now his law has no demands upon us.</P>
<P>BUT do you &s;uppo&s;e that the church of Eng|land would offer that to &s;atisfy the demands of GOD's law which &s;he has declared in expre&s;s words will not endure the &s;everity of GOD's judgment; would &s;he offer more than what &s;he has pronounc|ed &s;ufficient &s;atisfaction? This would be works of &s;upererogation, which &s;he condemns in her 14th article. But &s;ays the objector, do you think it is the doctrine of the church that what <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has done already, is &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of <HI>God</HI> for the &s;ins of every man in the world? &s;o that our repentance, or any thing we can do, is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;atisfy the demands of the law?</P>
<P>HEAR what &s;he &s;ays in her 31&s;t article, in which are the&s;e words,&mdash;The offering of CHRIST once made, is that perfect redemption, propitiation and &s;atisfaction for all the &s;ins of the whole world, both actual and original, and there is none other &s;atis|faction for &s;in but that alone. And the 11th article &s;ays, we are accounted righteous before <HI>God</HI> only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and not for our own works or de&s;ervings. Is this the doctrine of the church of England? &s;ays the objector.&mdash;I an&s;wer, Yes; if you will take her word for it: the&s;e are her words, which I have recited; the very words: as you may ea&s;ily find by looking into her articles of Religion, which I promi&s;ed to preach agreeable to, when I was ordained. Says the objector, I u&s;ed to have a good opinion of the
<PB N="41" REF="034685_0041_0FFF665859A05938">church of England, but if &s;he holds to &s;uch doc|trines, I am quite out with her, I never mi&s;tru&s;ted that &s;he held licentious doctrines: according to this I may live as wicked as I plea&s;e, and get to heaven at la&s;t; for if the ju&s;tice of <HI>God</HI> is already &s;atisfied, for all the &s;ins of the whole world, both original and actual, this ju&s;tice can never take hold of me. &mdash;This is licentious, abominably licentious, I an|&s;wer: I have &s;hown you the doctrine of the church of England, but do not a&s;k or de&s;ire you to call it licentious. St Paul in the 2d chap. of his epi&s;tle to Titus, at the 11th ver&s;e, expre&s;sly &s;ays, as it &s;tands in the original,&mdash;hath appeared the grace of GOD, bringing &s;alvation to all men; and the angel of the LORD, who brought the news of a Saviour born, &s;ays, <HI>I bring you good news of great joy, which &s;hall be to all people:</HI> Yet the apo&s;tle Jude, in the 4th ver&s;e of his epi&s;tle, tells us of <HI>ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into la&s;ci|viou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> but did that prove that it was not the grace of our God, becau&s;e they turned it into la&s;ci|viou&s;ne&s;s? No, by no means.</P>
<P>BUT having con&s;idered the gift of GOD; though not near &s;o fully as I intended, for want of time, I mean to &s;ay more of it when I come to the clo&s;e of my &s;ubject; yet I think I have proved it to be a free gift and no purcha&s;e of ours, and a durable gift, without depending on any conditions to be performed by us; the gifts and callings of GOD being without repentance, and &s;o cannot be lo&s;t by us, but mu&s;t la&s;t forever, and I having &s;hewn this to be agreeable to the doctrine of the church of England, and I am now ready to enter upon the next particular in my text, which is Eternal Li&s;e, the thing given; but this mu&s;t be referred to another opportunity.</P>

<P><HI>The wages of &s;in is death: but the gift of God is aternal life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I HAVE in former di&s;cour&s;es, con&s;idered the particulars of Wages, Sin, Death, and the gift of God ; now therefore I come to con|fider the thing given&mdash;eternal Life.</P>
<P>THE expre&s;&s;ion, eternal Life, has in the New Te&s;tament, &s;everal meanings: <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf is called Life, and eternal Life, not only becau&s;e as GOD he is perfection of life and independent exi&s;t|ence, but al&s;o as our mediator and head; he is the fountain and author of our &s;piritual and eternal life, for &s;ays St. John, <HI>the life was manife&s;t and we have &s;een it and &s;hew unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was mani&s;e&s;t unto us and we are in him:</HI> that is true, even in his &s;on Je|&s;us Chri&s;t this is the true God and eternal life; and Jefus &s;ays, <HI>I am the very truth and the life&mdash;he that hath the &s;on bath life.</HI> Again, eternal life means an eternal duration of pertect and compleat hap|pine&s;s in the future world.</P>
<P>THEY who a&s;ked Chri&s;t, What they &s;hould have, having for&s;aken all and followed him? he &s;ays, <HI>in the world to come, eternal Life.</HI> It is called an eternal inheritance; a city that hath foundation,
<PB N="43" REF="034685_0043_0FFF6660828D7910">who&s;e builder and maker is GOD&mdash;where there &s;hall be no more death, crying or &s;orrow, where all tears &s;hall be wiped off all faces.&mdash;GOD's favour which is life&mdash;his pre&s;ence which is fulne&s;s of joy &mdash;a place at his right hand, where are plea&s;ures for evermore. It is &s;tyled entering into the joy of our Lord&mdash;the redeemed of the Lord, &s;hall obtain gladne&s;s and joy&mdash;and &s;orrow and mourning &s;hall flee away. It is called joy&mdash;crown of rejoicing&mdash; being pre&s;ented before God faultle&s;s, with exceed|ing joy; being with Chri&s;t to &s;ee his glory&mdash;a &s;tate of incorruption, immortality,&mdash;and many other expre&s;&s;ions are u&s;ed to paint it out.</P>
<P>AGAIN, the pre&s;ent knowledge of our title to eternal happine&s;s, and knowing Chri&s;t, who is our title, is called life eternal: to know Je&s;us Chri&s;t is life eternal, we are told&mdash;He that hath the &s;on, that is, the knowledge of him, hath life; he that hath not the &s;on, hath not life; i. e. he is de&s;ti|tute of the knowledge of &s;alvation: So he that be|lieveth on the &s;on, hath everla&s;ting life. 1&s;t John. c.5. Not &s;hall have it but hath it now, i. e. the know|ledge of it. He that believeth in me though he were dead, his body &s;eparated from the &s;oul, yet he &s;hall live, the knowledge of JESUS would be to his &s;oul, life and joy; and he that liveth is po&s;&s;e&s;t of temporal life in his body, and believeth in me &s;hall never die, &s;aid Je&s;us; i. e. the knowledge of his title to eternal life, and happine&s;s in Chri&s;t, will ever be a &s;ource of life and joy to his &s;oul: whether in the body or out of it. Life and im|mortality are &s;aid to be brought to light by the go&s;|pel, i. e. the go&s;pel brings to us the knowledge of our title to life and immortality: But the matter is &s;o plain I need not multiply proofs. Every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that whenever he comes to the
<PB N="44" REF="034685_0044_0FFF6663612D2618">knowledge of his having a &s;ure title to any good thing, his mind immediately comes into a com|fortable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, thought it is not yet come. And in temporal things it often happens, that the pro&s;pect of a good is a greater enjoyment than the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it&mdash;but in &s;piritual it is not &s;o: however when we come to the knowledge of our &s;ure title in Chri&s;t to eternal life: our mind, en|ter into immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion we enjoy the comfort of it the mind feels a &s;en&s;e of its &s;piritual life, the &s;oul begins to live; it begins its eternal life, for as the Father hath life in him&s;elf &s;o hath he given to the &s;on to have life in him&s;elf. John v. 26. <HI>and the bread of God which cometh down from heaven is he which giveth life unto the world.</HI> John vi. 30.&mdash; So Je&s;us the fountain and author of our &s;piritual and eternal life, communicates to us by his &s;pirit the knowledge of him&s;elf; then the &s;pirit taking of the things of Je&s;us and &s;howing them to us; we are refre&s;hed and begin to live, the branches re|ceive nouri&s;hment from their vine, and became thrifty and flouri&s;hing.&mdash;The Members receive nouri&s;hment from their head.&mdash;And this know|ledge of our being made perfect in our head, is in us, a well of water &s;pringing up to everla&s;ting life.</P>
<P>AGAIN, the expre&s;&s;ion eternal Life, in &s;cripture, &s;ometimes means our title to eternal life. St. Paul exhorts Timothy to hold on eternal life, i.e. to ad|here clo&s;ely to his title to eternal happine&s;s&mdash;to keep a lively remembrance of his title to eternal life, to lay fa&s;t hold of it with his mind; I &s;uppo&s;e I need not tell you that this eternal life was not an object to be literally laid hold of with his bodily hands, Je&s;us &s;aid to the Jews, John v. 39. <HI>&s;earch the &s;criptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life.</HI>&mdash; How, eternal life in the &s;criptures! why certainly no more than a title could be meant.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="034685_0045_0FFF6664F6241B80">
You have &s;o many acres of land in &s;uch a place &s;ays one&mdash;How does that appear&mdash;Search your deed from &s;uch a man, &s;ays he, and there you will find it&mdash;not &s;o many acres of earth, with rocks and trees, literally rapt up, in a piece of paper, but &s;uch and &s;uch words written, which give you a title to it;&mdash;Search the &s;criptures, yes, not only read them but &s;earch them, as one &s;earches for hid trea&s;ures, and then you will find that they te&s;tify of JESUS, and clearly point out your title in him, to a ble&s;&s;ed and eternal inheritance. If people would &s;earch and critically examine the &s;criptures, as they generally do the la&s;t will and te&s;tament of a rich parent,&mdash;what then? Why then, the chil|dren of this world, would not be &s;o much wi&s;er in their generation than the children of light, as they now are. Our &s;piritual Father is rich indeed, and we are told, rich unto all, and is not his la&s;t will and te&s;tament, worthy of a clo&s;e examination? cer|tainly it is, but how few of his children know what is convey'd were men as &s;uperficial in the examina|tion of matters of a temporal kind, as of the &s;crip|tures, the intere&s;t of this world, would be in a much more confu&s;ed &s;ituation than at pre&s;ent it is&mdash;But to return, eternal life, in the language of &s;cripture commonly means a title to everla&s;ting happine&s;s, gain'd not only by the perfect obedience of Chri&s;t, to all the commands of the law: but al&s;o by his &s;uffering death, the wages of &s;in, the penalty of the law; and thereby having obtained eternal redemp|tion for us, made our title clear to eternal life, as St. Paul te&s;tifies. For all that &s;tood in our way, to keep us from eternal happine&s;s, was the cur&s;e of the law for di&s;obedience, and the want of per|fect righteou&s;ne&s;s or obedience to the law, which obedience, &s;trictly merited eternal life by the terms
<PB N="46" REF="034685_0046_0FFF66668F593300">of law <HI>He that doeth the things contained in the law &s;hall live in them; if he keep all my &s;tatutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he &s;hall &s;urely live he &s;hall not die.</HI></P>
<P>Now JESUS was made a cur&s;e for us&mdash;the ini|quities of us all were laid upon him, and he ta&s;ted death for every man, and &s;o acting for every man, when he died, we were all dead, the whole &s;entence of the law executed upon us, if one died for all, &s;ays St. Paul; and for this cau&s;e &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>He is mediator of the new te&s;tament; that by means of death for the redemption of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions under the fir&s;t te&s;tament, they which are called might receive the promi&s;e of eternal inheritance</HI>&mdash;So that the cur&s;e of the law for di&s;obedience was taken away by <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &mdash;and he being righteous having kept the law per|fectly, for he did no &s;in, neither was guile found in his mouth; brought in everla&s;ting righteou&s;|ne&s;s, as we are told, and being the Lord our righ|teou&s;ne&s;s; con&s;equently nothing remained to hin|der our title to eternal life, of which St. Paul &s;peaks, Rom. v. 18. <HI>Therefore, as by the offence of one, judg|ment came upon all men to condemnation: even &s;o by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men unto ju&s;tification of life.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the gift of GOD which the text informs is eternal life, God gave his Son to &s;atisfy the de|mands of the law&mdash;and to purcha&s;e for us a title to eternal life: &s;o that this gift of eternal life is in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> alone; and therefore not at all in any thing we have done, or can do.&mdash;When God gave us his Son he gave us the merit of his death, to free us from the contemning &s;entence of his law; and when God gave us his Son he gave us the &s;potle&s;s purity of his life, for our title to eternal life.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="034685_0047_0FFF6669786B4490">
ALL this was contained in the gift of his Son; and all this was a free gift; for <HI>God &s;o loved the world, while we were yet &s;inners, that he gave his &s;on;&mdash;when we were enemies he &s;pared not his own &s;on, but delivered him up for us all. How &s;hall he not with him al&s;o freely give us all things.</HI> For we are told <HI>God &s;ent not his &s;on, to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be &s;aved.</HI> The righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t was given to us. St. Paul mentions our receiving the gift of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, Romans, v. 17, and &s;ays of CHRIST, <HI>that he is made of God unto us, wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctifi|cation, and redemption;</HI> and his name is, <HI>the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> &s;o that eternal life, which is the reward of righteou&s;ne&s;s, is already given, for when GOD gave his Son for a covenant of the people, he gave a convenant well ordered in all things, and &s;ure; for when God promi&s;ed that in the &s;eed of Abra|ham, all the families of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed, he &s;pake not of &s;eeds as of many, but of one, which is Chri&s;t, and to him the promi&s;es were made; and we are told that <HI>the promi&s;es in Chri&s;t Je&s;us are not yea and nay; but yea and amen to the glory of God:</HI> that is &s;ure and certain, for GOD we are told, will have all men to be &s;aved, <HI>Je&s;us gave him&s;elf a ran|&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time.</HI>&mdash;This is the my&s;tery which St. Paul tells us, hath been hid from ages and generations, but now is made manife&s;t to his &s;aints; to whom GOD would make known what is the riches of the glory of this my&s;tery among the Gentiles; the gift of eternal life is directly oppo&s;ite to death&mdash;the wages of &s;in; death de|manded by the law for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, is endle&s;s mi|&s;erys. Life, the gift of GOD, is endle&s;s happine&s;s, death was our ju&s;t due; but life is a free gift; one we could merit; the other we could not:
<PB N="48" REF="034685_0048_0FFF666F81A29058">death contains every thing evil and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; eternal life contains every thing good and joyful. The law was a mini&s;tration of death; the go&s;pel the word of life: we are not under the law but un|der grace; we are dead to the law, but alive to GOD; our death by the &s;entence of the law was end|le&s;s, but Chri&s;t in whom we died, was God as well as man, and &s;o by means of his infinite dignity and excellence, paid the whole debt, in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time. How precious this gift of GOD! It de&s;troys death, and introduce life: it is perhaps the gift which Solomon &s;pake of which is, &s;ays he, as a precious &s;tone in the eyes of him that hath it, whither&s;oever it turneth it pro&s;pereth.</P>
<P>THIS gift of eternal life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, is what all the rhetoric in the world cannot fully expre&s;s the greatne&s;s of, nor our mo&s;t exten&s;ive thoughts comprehend. For the very objects of wrath and death, in the &s;ight of God him&s;elf, &s;hould by a bleeding dying Saviour God, be ran&s;om'd to eter|nal life, is a gift which &s;urpa&s;&s;es every thing, for greatne&s;s, but the very giver him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT is worthy of a GOD!</P>
<P>THIS gift of God is by grace; and not on con|dition of our doing &s;omething our&s;elves; God has him&s;elf given the conditions&mdash;the &s;potle&s;s life of Chri&s;t, and his precious blood: God has given the condition with the gift; and made it &s;ure to all the &s;eed: God has not given us another cove|nant of works,&mdash;for then St. Paul tells us, the re|ward would be of debt, and not of grace; but now the reward is all of grace; eternal life is not the re|ward of our doings or de&s;ervings, it is the gift of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the la&s;t Lord's Day, I left you to medi|tations upon the holy law of God&mdash;to contemplate upon his perfect ju&s;tice. I left you at the foot of

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN my former di&s;cour&s;es upon the&s;e words, I have con&s;idered the expre&s;&s;ions of Wages, Sin, Death, the Gift of GOD, and, eternal Life; But now I come in the 6th and la&s;t place to ex|amine what is meant by the a&s;&s;ertion, that this gift of GOD which is eternal Life, is in JESUS CHRIST our LORD.</P>
<P>FROM what I &s;aid in my la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e upon this text, I think it did appear that this expre&s;&s;ion, eternal life, has a particular reference to our title to eternal life: You know it is a very common way of &s;peaking with every per&s;on, to &s;ay, that an inheritance or any thing el&s;e is given, when no more than a clear title is given, and the per&s;on to whom the title is given many times comes not into the actual and full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the thing given, till a con&s;iderable time after; and &s;ometimes the per&s;on given to, knows nothing of the gift, even for years afterwards, though all that time his title is full, and every whit as clear in it&s;elf as it is when he comes to the knowledge of it; and though the thing is &s;aid to be given to him and to be his, yet it is often &s;aid he has it not, till he comes to the
<PB N="51" REF="034685_0051_0FFF6677F07D21B8">actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and &s;ometimes we &s;ay he has it, becau&s;e the title is given, though the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion has not yet taken place: So St. John tells us, that <HI>God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</HI> The apo&s;tle means the title, and not the full and actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, yet in our own per&s;on. I think it mu&s;t be evident to any one that does at all con&s;ider the matter, becau&s;e we are not in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion our&s;elves, what Chri&s;t has done is our title, and God gave his &s;on to do what he did; in a figurative way of &s;peaking indeed we may be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s eternal life now, as tho&s;e who be|lieve enjoy a comfortable knowledge of it.</P>
<P>AGAIN, tho&s;e who believe and tho&s;e who do not, already partake of &s;ome of the negative effects of it, i. e. the &s;entence of eternal death is not ac|tually executed upon them per&s;onally, and for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e this &s;entence was fully executed upon their head and &s;urety, who therefore con|tains their exemption from death, and their title to life in him&s;elf: again, we may in a figura|tive way of &s;peaking be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s eternal life, becau&s;e we live free from any damnation of death in Je&s;us <HI>the head of every man; our fir&s;t fruits is gone to appear in the pre&s;ence of</HI> GOD <HI>for us. It is within the vail, into the mo&s;t holy place, in Hea|ven it&s;elf, that Je&s;us the forerunner is for us entered,</HI> as we are expre&s;sly told; and has &s;at down at the right hand of GOD; and therefore has taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of our eternal inheritance for us; con&s;e|quently, we by him who acts for us as our Medi|ator, have already taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, when chri&s;t a&s;cended, of that everla&s;ting inheritance of glory which is the reward of all his toils even of his blood and &s;weat and perfect innocence, and in the eye of the law he is their all.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="034685_0052_0FFF667C7B1C3F78">
AND he keeps po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that precious reward purcha&s;ed for the whole body of human nature by him the head, and &s;o will bring all his members where he him&s;elf is at the time appointed, then the whole harve&s;t will be collected into that heavenly garner, where the fir&s;t fruits went formerly, to make way, even a free and open pa&s;&s;age for us the whole harve&s;t, into that ble&s;&s;ed place, where we are told there are many man&s;ions, but we our&s;elves as individuals are not yet actually entered into that e|ternal inheritance to which we are now heirs, and therefore we have literally as individuals, a &s;ecure title in him who is the covenant of the people, the everla&s;ting covenant, that is already fulfill'd and perfect, and &s;o can never be broken, that co|venant which we are not only told, is well ordered, but is al&s;o &s;ure, therefore this eternal life is the gift of God; our title is by promi&s;e, it is by grace, St. Paul tells us, to the end that the promi&s;e might be &s;ure to all the &s;eed&mdash;but if it was not by grace but a promi&s;e by our works, it would be &s;ure to none of the &s;eed, becau&s;e they all &s;in.</P>
<P>I THINK that I have opened my way, and made it clear to the bu&s;ine&s;s immediately before me; at lea&s;t it appears to me &s;o&mdash;and I hope it does or will appear &s;o to you who hear me.</P>
<P>THE bu&s;ine&s;s immediately before us is, to &s;how that the gift of God which is eternal life; i. e. our &s;ure title to it is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord. And that I may do this to the be&s;t advantage, I will enter upon it in two ways.</P>
<P>FIRST negatively, that this eternal life or title to it which is the gift of God cannot po&s;&s;ibly be any where out of Chri&s;t, and then &s;how, &s;econdly, how this gift of eternal life our title to eternal ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s is in Chri&s;t; but fir&s;t negatively, that our title
<PB N="53" REF="034685_0053_0FFF667E2A6AF688">cannot, po&s;&s;ibly be any where out of Chri&s;t, let us &s;earch a little: but where &s;hall we look? look to God &s;ays one, but the &s;ure word of prophecy tells <HI>that God was in Chri&s;t reconciling the world to him|&s;elf, not imputing their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es unto them</HI>&mdash;why not imputing them? becau&s;e Chri&s;t took them away, &s;o that the fir&s;t attempt to run away from Chri&s;t, we have run into him&mdash;God was in Chri&s;t &mdash;and we don't read of his being out of him &s;ince; but let us once con&s;ider things that are not, as tho' they were&mdash;let us con&s;ider the divine nature as not united with the human: well where &s;hall we look for our life in God, di&s;tinct from the man Je|&s;us? &mdash;What &s;hall we look to in God, &s;hall we look to his ju&s;tice? ju&s;tice won't clear the guilty, it con|demns us; &s;hall we look to goodne&s;s for mercy? mercy cannot oppo&s;e ju&s;tice, for God is one: he is not oppo&s;ed to him&s;elf, his truth is concerned in the matter, that ju&s;tice &s;hould have its cour&s;e&mdash; Shall we look to wi&s;dom? it cannot be the wi&s;dom of God to exerci&s;e one attribute in oppo&s;ition to ano|ther. If ju&s;tice condemns us, no one of his attri|butes will oppo&s;e ju&s;tice, how does he &s;ave us by grace or mercy at all then? he &s;aves us in Je&s;us, who &s;uffered the demands of ju&s;tice; &s;o that ju&s;|tice and mercy are united in him and go hand in hand, con&s;equently we can find no God our &s;aviour out of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>WELL then, &s;hall we look to our&s;elves for a title to life? we are &s;inners and the <HI>wages of Sin is Death:</HI> &s;hall we look to the law of God&mdash;that <HI>cur|&s;es every one that continues not in all things written in it to do them.</HI> That as a mini&s;tration of Death, &s;hall we look to the &s;criptures for life&mdash;they te&s;tify of Je&s;us: &s;hall we look to the go&s;pel in particular, that knows nothing &s;ave Je&s;us Chri&s;t and him cru|cified:
<PB N="54" REF="034685_0054_0FFF668532B37248">Shall we look where el&s;e, to any name out of Chri&s;t, or &s;ect, or denomination of religion, any where po&s;&s;ibly to be found that promi&s;es life or &s;alvation out of him. But there is no o|ther name given under heaven, among men, whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved. Well then, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary at la&s;t to look to Chri&s;t for life, &s;ince we cannot find it any where out of him&mdash;but can we find our life in Chri&s;t? yes, there it is to be found, ble&s;&s;ed be God, God hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his &s;on.</P>
<P>BUT this brings me to &s;how, SECONDLY, How this gift of eternal life, our title to eternal ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord: that our title to everla&s;ting happine&s;s is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, not only my text, but many other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture do fully a&s;&s;ert, particularly St. John's words, which I ju&s;t now recited, are as expre&s;s as it is po&s;&s;ible for words to be; God &s;ays, <HI>He has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</HI></P>
<P>THAT our title to life eternal, if we have any title, is in Chri&s;t, is plain and certain; you cannot deny it I am &s;ure, I think that you will not. The &s;cripture is &s;o very expre&s;s in this point, that it appears that none that reverence the oracles of truth, and hear what they &s;ay re&s;pecting this mat|ter will have the hardine&s;s to di&s;pute the point; yet how general people a&s;&s;ert what is plainly and totally, oppo&s;ite or contrary to it, for in&s;tance, one of your aquaintance dies, we attend his funeral, the que&s;tion is, what is become of him? why, there is rea&s;on to hope <HI>for good E&s;tate,</HI> that he will appear at Chri&s;t's right hand: what rea&s;on? he was an upright, &s;ober, religious, good &s;ort of a man:&mdash; here you &s;ee people look to the man him&s;elf to find
<PB N="55" REF="034685_0055_0FFF6687CFF00848">his title to eternal life: they pretend to find in him and by the works of the law too, tho' by the deeds of the law no fle&s;h &s;hall be ju&s;tified: but he &s;howeth marks and evidences of his having made his peace with God; &s;ays one: but had the poor mi&s;erable man, no mediator to act for him, that he was obliged to undertake the bu&s;ine&s;s him&s;elf; of making his peace with God? St. Paul in his e|pi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;. 2d chap. 13 ver&s;e and onward, &s;ays to the Gentiles, to whom he wrote. <HI>But now in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, ye who were &s;ometimes afar off, i. e. ye Gentiles, are made nigh by the blood of Chri&s;t: for be is our peace, who hath made both one, i. e. Jew and Gentile, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; having aboli&s;hed in his fle&s;h the enmity, even the law of commandments contain'd in ordinances; for to make in him&s;elf of twain one new man, &s;o making peace; and that he might reconcile both, i. e. both Jew and Gentile, unto God in one body by the cro&s;s, having &s;lain the enmity thereby.</HI></P>
<P>HERE you &s;ee, St. Paul never thought of our ma|king our own peace with GOD our&s;elves, but talks altogether of Chri&s;t's being our peace, and of his reconciling us to God, in one body by the cro&s;s: you &s;ee he &s;eems to think that Chri&s;t has made our peace with God already, and therefore our title to peace is in him.</P>
<P>ANOTHER of our acquaintance dies&mdash;the word is, there is little or no hope of him. But why? He was a poor creature, a hardened &s;inner. He has no title to heaven then you think. No. What's the matter, why has not he a title? Becau&s;e he was a wicked, impenitent wretch. But don't St. Paul &s;ay to Timothy, <HI>This is a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, of whom I am chief.</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="034685_0056_0FFF668C9F14B9E0">But he died impenitent. What then? Why, he cannot be &s;aved. But don't St. Paul &s;ay&mdash;the gifts and calling of God, are without repentance!&mdash; Here, I think, you mu&s;t all &s;ee, that people in general look for a man's eternal life in the man him&s;elf: they don't appear to &s;u&s;pect that it is to be found any where el&s;e: they expect to find the man's title to happine&s;s in him. They &s;eek the living among the dead. There is not a man in the world that can &s;how any title to eternal life in him&s;elf. God hath given us eternal life in his Son, and no where el&s;e.&mdash;How vain and un&s;erip|tural are the traditions of men!</P>
<P>BUT it is high time for me to &s;how particularly how our title to eternal life is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; but what hinders or prevents from our having a title to eternal life in our&s;elves without a Me|diator.</P>
<P>GOD made man at fir&s;t upright, and in his own image, and if he had continued &s;o, none of you can harbour the lea&s;t doubt, but that his life would have been eternally happy: But he fell into &s;in: What then? Why the &s;entence of death pa&s;&s;ed upon him: For what? For &s;in; for the wages of &s;in is death the text tells us; but what el&s;e is there, that prevents us from having a title to eter|nal life in cur&s;elves? It is the want of a perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s; for in Romans, x. 5, St. Paul &s;ays, Mo&s;es de&s;cribeth the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law, <HI>that the man that doeth tho&s;e things &s;hall live by them.</HI> But we are told that <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them.</HI> So that the righteou&s;ne&s;s that gives us a title to life, mu&s;t be perfectly faultle&s;s; the lea&s;t failure or defect de&s;troys us forever; &s;o that noth|ing is wanting in us for a title to eternal life in our|&s;elves,
<PB N="57" REF="034685_0057_0FFF668E5D1BB4B8">but the&s;e two things, a freedom from &s;in, and a perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s; which is a full com|pliance with every thing the law commands. If there is any thing wanting in us be&s;ides the&s;e two things, I &s;hall be exceedingly obliged to any man in the world to let me know it&mdash;to point it out to me: But it is evident to a moral demon&s;tration, that nothing el&s;e but the&s;e two things are wanting in us, in order to a title in our&s;elves to eternal life. We want in our&s;elves a freedom from &s;in and a perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, nothing el&s;e is wanting; for take away &s;in, and there is no condemnation; and let us have a perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, and then the promi&s;e is, <HI>The man that doeth the&s;e things, &s;hall live by them.</HI> God &s;ays, <HI>If a man keep all my &s;ta|tutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he &s;hall &s;urely live, he &s;hall not die:</HI> but every one that knows any thing about the &s;cripture or him&s;elf, mu&s;t at once confe&s;s, that none of us, have either of the&s;e two requi&s;ites in our&s;elves: neither a freedom from &s;in, nor a perfect faultle&s;s righteou&s;ne&s;s, for we have all &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God. <HI>There is not a man that liveth and &s;inneth not, there is none righteous no not one: the &s;cripture hath concluded all under &s;in.</HI> In many things we offend all, &s;ays the apo&s;tle; therefore we have no perfect, righteou&s;ne&s;s in our&s;elves; therefore by the deeds of the law no fle&s;h &s;hall be ju&s;tified in God's &s;ight; <HI>But Chri&s;t Je&s;us is the Lamb of God which taketh away the &s;in of the world, having put away &s;in by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf.</HI> We are told death was what all men were &s;entenced to for &s;in; we are likewi&s;e told <HI>Chri&s;t ta&s;ted death for every man.</HI></P>
<P>We thus judge, &s;ays St. Paul, <HI>that if one died for all, then were all dead, and he died for all,</HI> &s;ays he; &s;o that death the wages of &s;in for every man,
<PB N="58" REF="034685_0058_0FFF668FF4968258">God has paid to Chri&s;t already; laying upon him the iniquities of us all, I&s;aiah liii. 6. And God was not unju&s;t, he did not withhold or keep back any part of the wages; he paid the whole of our wages, to the Captain of our &s;alvation. So that here is a perfect freedom from &s;in, from guilt, from tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, from condemnation, from death; but where is it? Not in our&s;elves, but in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: &s;o that a freedom from &s;in, which we be|fore ob&s;erved, was nece&s;&s;ary to a title to life, is &s;ound in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and no where el&s;e; no atone|ment for &s;in any where el&s;e. In Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord, we can find this purgation or purification from &s;in for all the world&mdash;in his bloody &s;weat which was in the garden&mdash;by the holes made by the thorns on the head&mdash;by the &s;courge on his back &mdash;by the nails in his hands and feet&mdash;and by the &s;pear thru&s;t into his &s;ide: We can find the atone|ment, in his blood, which was &s;hed for the remi&s;|&s;ion of &s;ins. Well, then we found at lea&s;t, one re|qui&s;ite or nece&s;&s;ary condition to a title to life which is a freedom from &s;in, but this is found in Chri&s;t, even in his death and &s;uffering.</P>
<P>Now then let us look for the other thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary in order to a title to life,&mdash;and that is, a perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, an un&s;ailing compliance with all the commands of <HI>God's</HI> law.</P>
<P>I SUPPOSE none of you will deny that Chri&s;t was righteous: He was the lamb without &s;pot; he did no &s;in we are told, neither was guile found in his mouth; he came to do the will of God, and declar'd that one jot or tittle &s;hould in no wi&s;e pa&s;s from the law till all was fulfilled. He is called Je&s;us the righteous, <HI>his name is the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s; he &s;uffered the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t.</HI> Well then, we have found that which the perfect
<PB N="59" REF="034685_0059_0FFF6694E231BD08">and holy law of God promi&s;es, life; even a perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, in Chri&s;t, who is our &s;urety, &s;o that we have found both the conditions of a title to life, and we have found them in Chri&s;t, even a perfect atonement for &s;in, by which the &s;in of the world is taken away and a perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s of one by which the many are made righteous as we are told: now what is there wanting to our title to eternal life? &s;urely nothing, <HI>the gift of God is eter|nal life in Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI> Then we have found our title there: there we have found every thing that gives a title, we have found death the wages, fully &s;uffered, the whole penalty inflicted, death ta&s;ted for every man, and that perfect righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of one by which the many individuals of mankind are made righteous, all this we have found in Chri&s;t; when God gave his &s;on, he gave all the conditions of our eternal life in him, &s;o that our title is in him, it is given in him: this, even a di&s;tant view of it, made the prophet Daniel, &s;peak of the &s;eventy weeks, at the end of which the Me&s;|&s;iah, even Je&s;us was to come, to fini&s;h the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, and to make an end of &s;in; and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everla&s;t|ing righteou&s;ne&s;s. Daniel ix. 24. <HI>This made David &s;ay, to his Lord who was al&s;o his &s;on, all my &s;prings are in thee, P&s;alms</HI> lxxxvii. 7. <HI>And God &s;ays of his people, their righteou&s;ne&s;s is of me, and he has given it to us in Chri&s;t.</HI> So if any a&s;k you: where is your title to heaven? do not deny the Lord that bought you, by &s;itting up any thing in your&s;elves for a title, but tell them your title is in Chri&s;t. But have you no title in your&s;elves? no, we had a title to eternal death, becau&s;e in our&s;elves we were &s;in|ners, and are &s;o &s;till in our&s;elves, and the wages of &s;in is death, but we have lo&s;t our title to death.&mdash;
<PB N="60" REF="034685_0060_0FFF669822D51958">How lo&s;t your title to death? Becau&s;e the &s;entence of death was executed upon us. Where? In Chri&s;t, when in Chri&s;t! When he died on the cro&s;s, and put away &s;in by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf. If one died for all then were all dead. But how is your title to heaven in Chri&s;t? Becau&s;e he was holy, harmle&s;s and undefiled, as we are told. But what's that to you? Why, <HI>He was of God made unto us, wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and redemption:</HI> he is the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash; But how does his righteou&s;ne&s;s give you a title to heaven? It is the reward God promi&s;ed to obedi|ence; Je&s;us was obedient, and &s;o had a title to the reward, in point of &s;trict ju&s;tice, and God never withholds the wages he promi&s;es, for he is a ju&s;t God.&mdash;God gave his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and will give the reward of it.</P>
<P><HI>But the world being ignorant of God's righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and going about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, have not &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God,</HI> &s;ays St. Paul: For, &s;ays he, <HI>Chri&s;t is the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth:</HI> Every one that believes he has done all for us, that the law required, don't undertake to keep the law in order to get a title to heaven; they don't go about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s to get a title, for they have found the end of the law, even Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who fulfilled even the la&s;t tittle of it, &s;o that they look to Chri&s;t as their title to eternal life.</P>
<P>CHRIST is expre&s;sly &s;tiled the &s;aviour of all men, the &s;aviour of Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel, and all who lived before the flood, of all who lived before the child Je&s;us was born; as much as he is of Paul, or Peter, or any of the Apo&s;tles, or any of us, who live &s;ince his coming into the world:
<PB N="61" REF="034685_0061_0FFF669B63B97E18">the &s;aviour of all men, from Adam to his younge&s;t &s;on he will ever have born. For Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the righteous, we are told, <HI>is the propitiation for our &s;ins, and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the whole world.</HI> The eleventh chapter of Saint Paul's epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, is &s;urely a li&s;t of men, from Abel to David, and the Prophets, who believed the promi&s;es of God, which were to be accompli&s;hed in Chri&s;t; for the re&s;titution of all things was, we are told, what God &s;pake by the mouth of all his holy prophets, ever &s;ince the world began.</P>
<P>AN intimation of life, and happine&s;s in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, immediately followed the &s;in of our fir&s;t parents in paradi&s;e; the &s;eed of the woman was promi&s;ed to brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head. The a&s;&s;u|rance of a Redeemer was renewed to the patriarch Mo&s;es, who we are told, <HI>e&s;teemed the reproach of Chri&s;t greater riches than all the trea&s;ures of Egypt.</HI> The very law of Mo&s;es, particularly the ceremo|nial part of it, pointed to eternal life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: their &s;acrifices of propitiation, figured out the death of that lamb of God, that takes away the &s;in of the world. His promi&s;es of a land flowing with milk and honey, were de&s;igned for no more than figures of the glory and riches of the heavenly canaan; the ordinances of the Jewi&s;h wor&s;hip, pointed out re|demption of mankind in one body in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT what mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between the Jews having the&s;e privileges under the di&s;pen&s;ation of the law as it was given by Mo&s;es, and their hav|ing them by the law:&mdash;for they did not belong to the law as &s;uch; for it was only the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen|&s;ation of the law prefigured?

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I HAVE heretofore con&s;idered each parti|cular of my text in their natural order: After a &s;hort review of what has been already &s;aid, what now remains is to an&s;wer &s;ome objections which are made again&s;t the doctrine contained in the words of my text.</P>
<P>WHEN I fir&s;t made choice of the&s;e words for the &s;ubject of our meditations, I expected to have fini&s;hed what I had to &s;ay upon them, in two di&s;|cour&s;es; but after I had entered upon this ground, I found it a field &s;o exten&s;ive, that I &s;ound it im|po&s;&s;ible to do it any tolerable ju&s;tice, without tak|ing &s;omewhat of a di&s;tinct view of each particular part: which has made it nece&s;&s;ary for me to en|tertain you with the mo&s;t grand and principal views, that this exten&s;ive field afforded: for no le&s;s than three weeks &s;ucce&s;&s;ively I made choice of this particular text, becau&s;e it held up to our view in one &s;ingle ver&s;e, a complete &s;ummary of both, the law and the go&s;pel, of the covenant of works and the covenant of grace; of the death of the human world, and its re&s;toration to life: of the ju&s;t &s;eve|rity of God's judgment, and the everla&s;ting cove|nant
<PB N="64" REF="034685_0064_0FFF66A522AFEDB8">of his peace, of the condemnation of the whole body of human nature, to endle&s;s mi&s;ery under one head, and of the complete ran&s;om of the very &s;ame body, and its clear title to everla&s;ting happine&s;s, under another head. The fir&s;t head was of the earth, earthy; the &s;econd head was &s;piritual, even the Lord from heaven: The fir&s;t covenant, under the fir&s;t head, gendered to bondage univer&s;ally; the &s;econd covenant, under the &s;econd head, is an univer&s;al introduction into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t covenant condemns the whole body of human nature in its head, without a &s;ingle excep|tion; the &s;econd ju&s;tifies and &s;aves the whole body of the &s;ame human nature in its &s;econd head, without a &s;ingle exception. In &s;hort, the fir&s;t covenant condemns Adam and all his po&s;terity to everla&s;ting damnation. The &s;econd covenant ju&s;|tifies Adam and all his po&s;terity, to eternal life. The fir&s;t covenant was but of &s;hort continuance, and made way for the &s;econd; the &s;ccond is the everla&s;ting covenant of God's peace; which on our part is fulfilled already to the la&s;t title; and on God's part he has promi&s;ed expre&s;sly, that it &s;hall never be broken.</P>
<P>I CHOSE this pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, that I might di&s;cover to you, both the law and the go&s;pel in one &s;ingle view, that you might learn to know them apart&mdash;that you might know what is law and what is go&s;pel. I pre&s;ented them to you, both in one field, that you might view them both at once, with|out any thing between them, except a &s;ingle word, a particle which denotes di&s;tinction; contrariety: The wages of &s;in is death, but the gift of God is eternal life; that you might &s;o critically di&s;tingui&s;h them, as to be able to know the law wherever you
<PB N="65" REF="034685_0065_0FFF66AD731387F0">meet with it in &s;cripture,&mdash;particularly in the part of it called the New Te&s;tament; and that you might be able to know the go&s;pel wherever you meet with it in &s;cripture, as well in what is called the Old Te&s;tament as the New: for people gene|rally run into this grand mi&s;take, that all that is contain'd in tho&s;e books of &s;cripture, commonly called the Old Te&s;tament is law, and that all that is contain'd in tho&s;e books wrote by Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, James, Peter and Jude, commonly called the New Te&s;tament, is go&s;pel, every word of it: But the go&s;pel was preached to Adam and Eve, by Chri&s;t him&s;elf, when they re|ceived the promi&s;e of the &s;eed of the woman to brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head. Chri&s;t the &s;on of God, conver&s;ed with men frequently, in a &s;en&s;ible way, even from the creation of Adam, till his own incar|nation, and then till his a&s;cention into heaven. But of God, even the Father, we are told, no man hath &s;een him at any time. And again, God whom no man hath &s;een or can &s;ee.</P>
<P>BUT Chri&s;t preached the go&s;pel to Abraham, St. Paul &s;ays, Galatians iii. 8. <HI>The &s;cripture fore|&s;eeing that God would ju&s;tify the heathen througb faith, preached before the go&s;pel unto Abraham, &s;ay|ing, In thee &s;hall all the nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> This was the go&s;pel of peace. All &s;uch like un|conditional promi&s;es of good, were the preaching of the go&s;pel of peace. But promi&s;es, on condi|tion of perfect obedience were law. David preach|ed the go&s;pel, and even Mo&s;es, him&s;elf, and all the prophets; the prophecies of I&s;aiah, are a very great part if not almo&s;t all go&s;pel&mdash;But be&s;ides preaching by words, it was preaching by Hiero|gliphicks or figures pretty con&s;tantly, from Adam's time till Chri&s;t the &s;ub&s;tance of all tho&s;e figures,
<PB N="66" REF="034685_0066_OFFF66AF55D94EB8">came in per&s;on: For what were the &s;acrifices, of Abel, Noah, and Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, but preaching Chri&s;t by figure and pointing to him as the true &s;acrifice for &s;in? And what was the Jewi&s;h tabernacle, and temple, and their whole wor&s;hip, their ceremonies of purification and all their &s;acrifices, but preaching go&s;pel by figure, and pointing out Chri&s;t the &s;aviour of the world? Again, What is commonly called the New Te&s;tament, is far from being all go&s;pel, for what is the greate&s;t part of Chri&s;t's &s;ermon upon the mount, and &s;everal o|ther di&s;cour&s;es to the Jews, but law, even the mo&s;t perfect explanation of God's law, the covenant of works, that ever appeared in the world.</P>
<P>WHAT are all the quotations from the law which are to be found in St. Paul's Epi&s;tles, where he introduces the law, to &s;hew its in&s;ufficiency for &s;alvation.</P>
<P>WHAT are all the&s;e but plain law; the cove|nant of works? And what is the fir&s;t part of my text? <HI>The wages of &s;in is death,</HI> but a view of the whole &s;ub&s;tance of the law of God, the covenant of works. So far as we have any thing to do with it &s;ince the fall of Adam, for being &s;inners, all the claim we could lay to the law was only threaten|ings; we had nothing to receive from the cove|nant of works but condemnation; but the prom|i&s;es of good things annexed to obedience in the law, we in our&s;elves are nothing to do with, be|cau&s;e we had not that obedience which was the indi&s;pen&s;ible condition. But all the promi&s;es of good things, and all the declarations of good things given to us, without any thing required of us, as the condition of our title, whether found in the Old Te&s;tament or in the New, are the go&s;pel of the grace of God; they are gifts by grace and not
<PB N="67" REF="034685_0067_0FFF66B11490F038">of debt; for the gift of God is eternal life, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord: and the gifts and callings of God are without repentance, without any con|ditions required of us, the go&s;pel is the covenant of God's peace&mdash;It is good tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be to all people; for the head of every man is Chri&s;t&mdash;He is the Saviour of the body, the Saviour of all men we are expre&s;sly told, by the word of truth, but methinks I hear an objector to this purpo&s;e, how comes it to pa&s;s that of all the clergy of the Church of England, you are the only one, that ever found out that is the doctrine of the Bible, that all men have a title in Chri&s;t to eternal Life; that all men will finally be &s;aved, and how does it become you as a clergyman of the Church of England, to teach a doctrine &s;o contrary to what is, and ever has been taught by that Church, &s;o no difference to be paid to any of her bi&s;hops, or the judgment or opinion of any other, of her great and learned men, nor indeed to the opinion of the whole Chri&s;tian church, for &s;eventeen hundred years; I an&s;wer, I am not the only one of all the clergy of the Church of England, that has found this doctrine in the Bible; and if I was the only one, &s;urely I have a right to preach the go&s;pel even the truth as it is in Je&s;us if I find it, whether I a|gree with another man or not, unle&s;s the authority of men is greater than the authority of God; cer|tainly I have no right to preach, what I think to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the truth, however as a clergy|man of the Church of England, I have a right to judge for my&s;elf, of the promi&s;es of God, for the church of England in the clo&s;e of her &s;eventeenth article of religion directs thus, even the&s;e very words, we mu&s;t receive God's promi&s;e, in &s;uch wi&s;e as they be generally &s;et forth in the holy &s;criptures; but as
<PB N="68" REF="034685_0068_0FFF66B4708D3AD0">&s;he has not told in her articles howGod's promi&s;es are to be under&s;tood, except as they are generally &s;et forth in the holy &s;criptures, &s;he certainly leaves it to me to judge for my&s;elf of the&s;e promi&s;es, and I do judge them to be, promi&s;es of eternal life to all mankind without exception in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord: and the articles of the church of England, as I have heretofore, taken notice, do &s;et forth the offering of Chri&s;t once made as a perfect re|demption, propitiation and &s;atisfaction for all the &s;ins of the whole world, both original and actual: now I a&s;k, if there is perfect &s;atisfaction made by Chri&s;t, for every &s;in of the whole world, how ju&s;|tice can ever condemn, or execure the &s;entence of the law for &s;in, upon any one individual of the hu|man race? when a perfect &s;atisfaction is already made to God, for all the &s;ins of men, to demand the payment over again is evidently the highe&s;t inju&s;tice&mdash;As great inju&s;tice, as it would have been, to have puni&s;hed all mankind with everla&s;ting mi|&s;ery if no one of them had ever &s;inned; if every &s;in of the whole world is &s;atisfied for; it is plain and evident that every man mu&s;t be &s;aved: For what can condemn any man if the &s;ins of all are &s;ati&s;|fied for? if they are not &s;aved, it is plain they can|not be puni&s;hed; but there is no middle way be|tween &s;alvation and damnation, &s;o that you mu&s;t &s;ee the church of England, has in her articles, taught the &s;alvation of all men, at lea&s;t implicity; and am I to be condemn'd for differing from all the church clergy in doctrine becau&s;e I preach up the doctrine of the 39th article? is this a crime to preach up the doctrine contain'd in the articles of the church of England, becau&s;e it is &s;aid none of the re&s;t of the clergy teach &s;o, but the contrary? Will the preaching up the doctrine of the church
<PB N="69" REF="034685_0069_0FFF66B77B662958">of England contradict the doctrine of her clergy? This would be a &s;ad thing indeed: Can preach|ing the doctrine of the church of England, be &s;howing di&s;re&s;pect to her Bi&s;hops, or great writers, or Clergy who compo&s;ed the 39 articles? Was it not the Bi&s;hops and Clergy of the church of Eng|land, and was it their doctrine; or did they &s;et forth a doctrine for the church of England, diffe|rent from their own doctrine? But my teaching that all mankind will finally be happy, is not preaching contrary to what is, and ever has been taught by all the re&s;t of the Clergy of the church of England. For no le&s;s a man than archbi&s;hop Tillot&s;on, has been wrote again&s;t for preaching this doctrine; and at lea&s;t in one of his &s;ermons, he did intimate that this was his opinion, though at the &s;ame time, he appeared to be in darkne&s;s and doubt about it, and &s;everal others of the clergy of the church, have taught the &s;alvation of ALL MEN. Mr. Murdon, a church clergyman now living I &s;uppo&s;e, has for a number of years, preached the &s;ame doctrine, as I do openly and fully; and has printed a book upon the &s;ubject, and yet is in full and regular &s;tanding under his Bi&s;hop. Dr. Steed, a clergyman of the church of England, who died a few years ago, and was greatly admired as a preacher, in mo&s;t parts of England, &s;tyled by late writers, the ingenious Dr. Steed, in a &s;ermon which he delivered in St. Paul's Cathedral Church in Lon|don, &s;peaking upon the Redemption has the&s;e words; <Q><HI>Our Saviour laid down his life for the &s;ins of the whole world, be came, that as in Adam all die, &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive: that as by one man's di&s;obedience many,</HI> the many, or mankind in general, <HI>were made &s;inners,</HI> treated as &s;uch, and made &s;ubject to death, the wages of
<PB N="70" REF="034685_0070_0FFF66B95FDF58F8">&s;in; &s;o by the obedience of one many were made righteous.</Q> Again, &s;peaking of Chri&s;t, &s;ays he, <Q>The &s;phere of his beneficence extended back|wards to the foundation of the world, and reaches forward to the la&s;t conflagration, he became the &s;aviour of all ages: from the fir&s;t birth of time to its la&s;t period: The father of mankind, from the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, to the going down of the &s;ame. The ble&s;&s;ings of his coming into the world are as exten&s;ive as the world, and as la&s;t|ing as eternity.</Q> Says he, <Q>Behold the Son of God, pouring forth his blood, as well as pray|ers, even for tho&s;e that &s;hed it; behold him at once bearing the in&s;ults, expiating the &s;ins, and procuring happine&s;s for mankind, till at la&s;t he bows his &s;acred head, and &s;huts up the &s;olemn &s;cene, with the&s;e &s;hort but comprehen&s;ive words, IT IS FINISHED: &mdash;the great, the &s;lupendous work is done. The univer&s;al &s;acrifice, which &s;hall take in all mankind, and which all mankind &s;hall contemplate throughout eternity with aw|ful joy and gratitude, is compleated:&mdash;the bene|fit of who&s;e actions and &s;ufferings reaches to all ages, all nations, all mankind. Our Saviour was a per&s;on born for the whole world, for which he died, a ble&s;&s;ing to all mankind, from the beginning of time, and whom all mankind will have rea&s;on to ble&s;s, when time &s;hall be no more.</Q></P>
<P>YOU may depend on it, that the&s;e words were preached in St. Paul's church in London; &s;o that as a Church Clergyman I am not teaching a doc|trine which is contrary to, what is or ever has been taught all the re&s;t of the Clergy of the Church of England. I don't know that I have ever &s;aid any thing that more &s;trongly points out the &s;alvation of all men, than the&s;e words of Dr. Steed, I have
<PB N="71" REF="034685_0071_0FFF660654C62D20">ju&s;t now recited, though I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that in &s;ome other pa&s;&s;ages of his &s;ermons, he &s;ays what &s;eems incon&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages I recited; but what I did recite he no doubt &s;aid. But I am &s;uppo&s;ed to differ from the whole body of the Chri&s;tian Church, for &s;eventeen hundred years; I an&s;wer, this would be a melancholy con&s;ideration indeed, if it were true: But can the tradition of the whole body of the chri&s;tian church, make void the go&s;pel, the everla&s;ting covenant of God's peace, but then, the tradition or opinion of the chri&s;tian church, pretty univer&s;ally for a thou&s;and years out of this &s;eventeen hundred, has been in favour of popery; therefore if the opinion of the body of the chri&s;tian church is a &s;ure proof of what is the true meaning of &s;cripture, then &s;urely, we ought all to become Roman Catholics immediately, for popery has the opinion of the whole body of the chri&s;tian church pretty univer&s;ally in its favour for ten hun|dred years, and the main body of the chri&s;tian church again&s;t her, for no more than about &s;even hundred years, and two hundred years of the&s;e &s;even, if the opinion of the whole chri&s;tian church had been taken, I &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect that the vote would have turned in favour of Popery: If the general opinion of the chri&s;tian church is any proof, to de|termine what is right and true: Why are not you all Papi&s;ts? If it is no proof, why is it alledged again&s;t me? The truth concerning the chri&s;tian church, I take to be this:&mdash;The opinion of tho&s;e that called them&s;elves chri&s;tians almo&s;t univer&s;ally through the world, was in favour of Popery, from about the year fifteen hundred; &s;ince the year fif|teen hundred, Chri&s;tians have been divided into two great cla&s;&s;es, being generally Roman Catho|lics or Prote&s;tants; but the Roman Catholics
<PB N="72" REF="034685_0072_0FFF5A2474DE2248">mo&s;t numerous. From the Apo&s;tles time till the introduction of Popery, is a period of about four or five hundred years; in which time, the general opinion of the Bi&s;hops and Clergy of the Chri&s;tian church was, that all mankind would be finally and everla&s;tingly happy, if we believe Dr. Whitby, who was e&s;teemed a great and learned divine of the church of England; and very profound in his knowledge of antiquity, having &s;pent much time in &s;earching the records of the primitive church, and cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to give this account through any prejudice in favour of this doctrine, that all men will be &s;aved; for he wrote a con&s;iderable treati&s;e again&s;t bi&s;hop Tillot&s;on, for intimating, or hinting in a &s;ermon that all men would finally be &s;aved. Says Dr. Whitby, <Q>This hath been the con&s;tant doctrine of the church of Chri&s;t, owned by the Greek and Latin fathers;&mdash;among the Greek fathers Chri&s;o&s;tom, who&s;e words are the&s;e, When the fullne&s;s of the Gentiles is come in, then all I&s;rael &s;hall be &s;aved, at the time of Chri&s;t's &s;econd coming, and the con&s;ummation of all things.&mdash;They of the people of I&s;rael, who for their unbelief were de&s;erted that God's mercy might be &s;howed to you: they &s;hall not always be left in unbelief, &s;ays Origen: But when the di&s;pen&s;ation of the &s;ulne&s;s of the Gen|tiles is compleated, they al&s;o &s;hall find mercy; I&s;rael may then al&s;o enter; for if the &s;ulne&s;s of the Gentiles be come in, then all I&s;rael &s;hall be &s;aved, and there &s;hall be one fold, and one Shep|ard.</Q> Dr. Whitby adds the&s;e words <Q>All the Latin fathers who have left us any commenta|ries, or notes on this epi&s;tle, meaning the epi&s;tle to the Romans, are plainly of the &s;ame mind, as you may &s;ee by con&s;ulting Hilary the Deacon,

<P>Now my hearers, you are able to determine whether by preaching up the &s;alvation of all men,
<PB N="74" REF="034685_0074_0FFF65D359D720A8">I have departed from the opinion of the whole chri&s;tian church; for &s;o long a period as &s;eventeen hundred years. I am &s;ure you will throw out of the que&s;tion the opinion of the chri&s;tian church, when almo&s;t &s;wallowed up in Popery for a thou|&s;and years, then I have the opinion of the whole body of the chri&s;tian church, according to Dr. Whitby's account, in favour of the doctrine I preach, for a period of between four and five hun|dred years, and that immediately after the apo&s;tles: But exclu&s;ive of popery, you may believe that part of mankind peri&s;h everla&s;tingly; have the opinion of almo&s;t half the chri&s;tian church, I mean the Prore&s;tant part, for a period of between two and three hundred years; &s;o that throwing Popery out of the que&s;tion, the chri&s;tian church &s;peak in my favour, for about double the time, that part of them give their voice in your favour; they give their voice in my favour immediately after the Apo&s;tles left them: Part of them now give their voice in your favour, after for&s;aking &s;ome of the &s;uper&s;ti|tious fears of Popery.</P>
<P>Now were the primitive Chri&s;tians as likely to derive errors from the Apo&s;tles, as the Prote&s;tants to derive errors from the Papi&s;h Church, out of which they came? &s;urely not.

I an&s;wer, that the common notion is, that the pur|po&s;e of preaching is to &s;hew men how to get a title to heaven; but this never was the true meaning or purpo&s;e of preaching the go&s;pel:&mdash;the purpo&s;e of preaching the go&s;pel is to &s;how people that they have in Chri&s;t a title to heaven already: it is the go&s;pel of the grace of God, good tidings of great

It was not telling Abraham or the nations, how to get a ble&s;&s;ing but only making it known that they were to be ble&s;&s;ed; life and immortality are brought to light thro' the go&s;pel, we are told, but preaching the go&s;pel do not make life nor immor|tality; it only brings them to light, what was not known before, light we are told maketh manife&s;t, but it cannot make manife&s;t, that which is not; it can only make that manife&s;t that is in being already! bring that thing to our knowledge, which we did not know before; mankind did not know that there was life or immortality for them, but there was really both; otherwi&s;e the go&s;pel could never have brought them to life: the preaching of the go&s;pel, does not tell us how to make our peace with God, but tells us that Je&s;us is our peace, <HI>that Je&s;us hath reconciled both Jew and Gentile unto God, in one body on the Cro&s;s, &s;o making peace;</HI> St. Paul, tells us what was the purpo&s;e of his preaching. See Col. i. 25, 26, 27, <HI>I am made a mini&s;ter,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>accord|ing to the di&s;pen&s;ation of God given to me, for you, to fulfit the word of God,</HI> i. e. what God hath promi&s;|ed, <HI>even the my&s;tery which hath been hid from ages, and from generations, but now is made manife&s;t to his &s;aints: to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this my&s;tery among the Gentiles.</HI> &mdash;And further on he &s;ays, that he laboured for them, but for what purpo&s;e was all this to them? he tells; <HI>that, their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love, and unto all riches of full a&s;&s;urance of under&s;tanding to the acknowledgement of the my&s;tery of God, and of the Father, and of Chri&s;t,
<PB N="76" REF="034685_0076_0FFF65DA208C17A0">in whom are bid all the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and knowledge: Now</HI> (&s;ays he in another place) <HI>the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing:</HI> the go&s;pel is preached that people may believe it, and the defired effect is, that they may be filled with all joy and peace in believing? People think it would be very kind in God, to &s;how them how they them&s;elves, may certainly get a title to eternal life: is it not quite as kind in God, to give them a title freely, and then make it known to them, that they have a title? Does it do people no good to fill them with joy and peace in believing; 'tis true, preaching the go&s;pel of peace, does not teach people how to get a title to eternal life, but it does better, it &s;hows them that they have a title alrea|dy, and is not this worth &s;howing? had not you rather be brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God, now, than to remain in bondage to fear; if you have a title to life in Chri&s;t, is it not worth knowing? Is it as well for you to be in darkne&s;s, fear, perplexity, under the cloud; thun|dering terrors of the law, for a hundred or a thou|&s;and years! as to be all that time in a &s;tate of joy and peace in believing? You know tho&s;e that believe <HI>the go&s;pel of peace have joy and peace in be|lieving; but faith comes by bearing,</HI> &s;ays St. Paul: <HI>and how &s;hall they bear,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>without a preacher? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the go&s;pel of peace, and publi&s;h glad ti|dings of good.</HI></P>
<P>It is true the title of all mankind to eternal life is &s;ecure, whether they know it or not, for their life is not in their own cu&s;tody, but is hid with Chri&s;t in God, and tho' the ravenous vulture, devoured their fir&s;t life, which was by the law, yet they have another life by grace, hid in a &s;ecure place where
<PB N="77" REF="034685_0077_0FFF65DBD5C99748">this vulture's eye never &s;aw&mdash;A place &s;ecure from moth and ru&s;t, that mocks the &s;ly approach and baffles all the pre&s;umptuous violence of pilfering thieves; but does it give men &s;atisfaction to know their &s;ecurity? the go&s;pel of peace is preach'd that you may know Je&s;us who is your life, your peace, your &s;ecurity, whom to know, we are told, is life eternal, he is &s;hown, that you may now begin to be refre&s;hed with &s;piritual life and joy, and that when you die you may die in peace and &s;leep in Je&s;us, and when you awake be &s;atisfied with his likene&s;s, that you may have <HI>part in the fir&s;t re&s;ur|rection; for the dead in Chri&s;t &s;hall ri&s;e fir&s;t, and boly and ble&s;&s;ed are they that have part in the fir&s;t re&s;urrection, over &s;uch the &s;econd death hath no power,</HI> that death in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, in which others will continue till the book of life is open'd to them and they read, <HI>The gift of God is eternal life through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI></P>
<P>To you the go&s;pel is preached, that you may now read your new name in that book, which contains your life, and &s;hews you in Chri&s;t pa&s;&s;ed from death to life; that when you fir&s;t ri&s;e from the grave, your heads may be encircled with bril|liant crowns of glory, and &s;eated upon thrones with Chri&s;t, to judge the world, and to judge angels, not the holy angels, but tho&s;e goats which are on Chri&s;t's left hand, who we read, are re&s;erved in chains of darkne&s;s to the judgment of the great day, when God &s;hall brui&s;e Satan under our feet, and then cau&s;e him to depart <HI>into the fire prepared for him and his angels.</HI> Is not a part in the fir&s;t re&s;urrection worth having, think ye? If your title to life is &s;a&s;e, don't you want to know it? If the glory of the riches of God's grace is free, is it therefore unworthy of preaching? If your title to
<PB N="78" REF="034685_0078_0FFF65DD72A7E540">life is &s;ure, is it no matter if the things which make for peace, is long hid from your eyes? Is a conti|nuance in bondage through lear of eternal death, as good a way of &s;pending your time as any? Is not the glorious liberty of the children of God now worth enjoying? Is it as comfortable to die in the fearful looking for of judgment, as to die in peace? Is it as eligible to die in &s;in as to &s;leep in Je&s;us? Is it no matter whether we rife with a &s;en&s;e and apprehen&s;ion of everla&s;ting &s;hame and contempt, or with a crown of rejoicing? Is it no matter whether we &s;tand at the la&s;t day before God, dead with guilty fear, having our mouths &s;lopt with a &s;en&s;e of guilt, waiting to be &s;lain by the &s;word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the judge, which bring into a condition of being made &s;piritually alive again, by the opening of the book of life, or whether we &s;it all that time on thrones in judgment with Chri&s;t? and at la&s;t, is it no matter whether we are &s;ome of the greate&s;t or lea&s;t of Chri&s;t's brethren; whether we are to be greate&s;t or lea&s;t in the kingdom of heaven, becau&s;e we are to be finally in it? Sr. Paul &s;ays, <HI>As one &s;tar differ|eth from another &s;tar in glory, &s;o &s;hall the re&s;urrection of the dead be:</HI> all the &s;tars in the firmament &s;hine, you know, yet one &s;tar differeth from another &s;tar in degree of glory, one &s;tar is &s;aid to be of the fir&s;t magnitude, another of the &s;econd, and another quite &s;mall in compari&s;on with the fir&s;t, yet they all &s;hine, and have their degree of glory.</P>
<P>By this time, I hope you are all &s;atisfied that, the go&s;pel is worth preaching, if it does bring life and immortality to light, but if you are not &s;atisfi|ed, yet we are told the foundation of God &s;tandeth &s;ure, and though you &s;hould not believe the record God has given of his &s;on, and &s;o as the apo&s;tle ex|pre&s;&s;eth

<P>AND my text tells us, <HI>the gift of God is eternal life, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord;</HI> There it is, whether we have now a view of it, or not, whether this great thing in this our temporal day, be hid from our eyes, or not, but that this my&s;tery of the go&s;pel of the grace of God may be now manife&s;ted in all our eyes; that we may be comforted and knit together in love; the God and Father of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h grant through Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Now therefore to the one infinitely wi&s;e, good, and eternal GOD, in Chri&s;t, be rendered all ho|nour and glory, thank&s;giving and prai&s;e, might, maje&s;ty and dominion, world without end.</P>
