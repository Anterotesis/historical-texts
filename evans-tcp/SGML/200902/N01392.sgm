<P>AMong&s;t all the Ornaments wherewith the Cha&s;te Mother is enriched, there is none more con&s;tantly worn, or more adorning than that of the Peremptory de&s;ire of her Husband's Pre&s;ence. This cau&s;es her to record the time of his departure, keep an exact reckoning of his ab&s;ence; and with frequent Calculations and Enquiries, to long and look out for the appointed Sea&s;on of his Expected Return. And to every Me&s;&s;age, Letter, Bill of Exchange or Lading, the clo&s;e of her dutyful An&s;wer is,</P>

<P>Now, <HI>Anno,</HI> One Thou&s;and Seven Hundred and Eleven, more than Sixteen Hundred Years are rolld away &s;ince CHRIST &s;aid and Writ, <HI>Surely I come Quickly.</HI> Therefore an earne&s;t Looking out for the Time, and Place of His Appearance, mu&s;t needs be very &s;ea&s;onable, very beautifull. And might we take it for granted that the Antichri&s;tian Plantation &s;poken of, <HI>Dan.</HI> 11. 45. intended their <HI>American</HI> Plantation; it would ca&s;t a great Light upon the Apocalyptical Scenes: becau&s;e the Time of this Plantation is cer|tainly

Lib. 2. p. 129. Suppo&s;e that hidden Age afforded Unparalleld In&s;tances of Obe|dience; Yet how came the Net-Cattel, the Hor&s;es, the Swine by their Annihilation? To remove them from off <HI>America</HI> is hu|manely impo&s;&s;ible.

<P><HI>Yet be &s;hall come to his end</HI> ] Notwith&s;tanding the great benefit accruing to Antichri&s;t by the&s;e Plantations; yet he &s;hall come to his end. Or, <HI>and</HI> he &s;hall come to his end. His planting of the&s;e Tabernacles was to be a Signal, whereby the Lovers of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> might certainly know that <HI>Babylon</HI>'s downfall was near. <HI>In Media bac Plantatione aliquid &s;ini&s;tri accidet huic hertulane. &mdash; Subito exorietur tempe&s;tas, quae naufragium adferet huic nauclere,</HI> Al&s;ted. de Mille annis. p. 203.</P>
<P>The Vulgar reads, <HI>Et veniet u&s;que ad Summitatem ejus</HI>] When Antichri&s;t &s;hould clamber up to the top of his imperial Tyranny, by extending it over the New World al&s;o; then he was to come to his End.</P>
<P>To make &s;ure work with Antichri&s;t, our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lation Printed at <HI>London,</HI> 1540. expre&s;&s;es this End, by <HI>Death.</HI> "for he &s;hall come to his <HI>Death.</HI> And pertinent Places of the <HI>Revelation</HI> are noted in the Margin. Antichri&s;t is &s;o to end, as never to begin again: No remnant of Life, no Re&s;urrection belongs to his Death.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the <HI>Time</HI> of this Plantation in the New World, and the <HI>Decay</HI> of Antichri&s;t; the Accommodation may &s;eem fair. GOD appeared remarkably, when He rai&s;ed up <HI>Nicolaum de Lyra.</HI> This Chri&s;tian <HI>Jew</HI> by his learned Commentaries on the whole Bible, did very much in clearing away the Rubbi&s;h, and beginning to lay the Foundations of the <HI>New Jeru&s;alem.</HI> This noble Work began more generally to be communicated in the year 1485. when it was Printed in a fair Character at <HI>Nuremberg.</HI> About the
<PB N="3" REF="001647_0004_0FB3EC51E9513D70">&s;ame time <HI>Chri&s;topher Columbus</HI> was wholly taken up in Supplica|ting Princes to afford him their A&s;&s;i&s;tance in his Attempt to di&s;|cover a New World. This was at la&s;t effected by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> October the Eleventh, One Thou&s;and four Hundred Ninety and Two: and the Plantation vigorou&s;ly carried on in the Years following. In the beginning of the next Century, <HI>Anno</HI> 1517. the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Reformation &s;prung up like the <HI>Palm</HI> Tree. The great Value <HI>Luther</HI> had for <HI>Lyra</HI> may be &s;een in his own Words; <HI>Ego</HI> Lyram <HI>ideo amo, et inter optimos pono, quod ubique diligenter re|tinet, et per&s;equitur hi&s;toriam: Quanquam authoritate patrum &s;e vinci paticur, et non nunquam eorum exemplo deflectit a proprietate &s;ententiae, ad ineptas allegorias,</HI> Gen. 2. fol. 21. &mdash; <HI>Saepe dixi qualis Theo|logia e&s;&s;et, cum ego primum hoc genus &s;tudij ingrederer. Literam di|cebant occidere: igitur oderam ego, prae omnibus interpretibus,</HI> Lyram, <HI>quod tam diligenter literalem &s;ententiam per&s;equeretur. Sed nunc, hanc ip&s;am ob Commendationem, Omnibus fere Scripturae interpretibus eum antepono.</HI> Gen. 9. fol. 118. And <HI>Sixtus Senen&s;is,</HI> and Dr. <HI>John Raynolds,</HI> give <HI>Lyra</HI> a very good Character.</P>
<P><HI>And none &s;hall be able to help him.</HI>] When the Sixth Vial comes to be poured out, the Word at <HI>Rome</HI> will be,</P>
<P>&mdash; Acheronta movebo.</P>
<P>But as Heaven <HI>will</HI> not; &s;o Hell <HI>cannot</HI> help her. When <HI>Henry</HI> the Eigth Writ a Book again&s;t <HI>Luther;</HI> Antichri&s;t expected &s;ome con&s;iderable Help from that Quarter, and for joy thereof, gave him the Title of <HI>Defender of the Faith.</HI> In this, like <HI>Balaam,</HI> or <HI>Caiaphas,</HI> the Pontiff unawares Prophe&s;ied of the great Things that Prince and his Succe&s;&s;ors were to accompli&s;h in abrogating the Papal Power, and Supporting the Reformation.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Daniel,</HI> 12. 7. <HI>The Scattering the Power of the holy People</HI> there mentioned, may de&s;ign the &s;ame Thing that is termed <HI>Slaying the Witne&s;&s;es,</HI> in the Eleventh of the <HI>Revelation.</HI> In Mr. <HI>Mede</HI>'s account, The <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Daniel</HI> is <HI>Apocalyp&s;is Contracta:</HI> 'Tis probable the Slain Witne&s;&s;es are to be found in this part of it; I know not of a more convenient Situtation. The Witne&s;&s;es are clothed with Civil, and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority: When this is taken away from them, they are &s;lain. The <HI>Jews</HI> have no Authority: <HI>Lo|Ammi</HI> is their proper Name. That which is not, can't be taken

<P>To pa&s;s to the New Te&s;tament, I have for &s;everal years &s;up|po&s;ed that &s;omething of a Local con&s;ideration is couched in the Parable of the Sower recorded <HI>Mat.</HI> 13. <HI>Mark,</HI> 4. and <HI>Luke,</HI> 8. The Parable comprehends the whole Series of Go&s;pel Admini&s;tra|tion continued to the end of the World: and that not only un|der a general Notion, as there are all the&s;e &s;orts of Ground every where, and at all times: but al&s;o with notable di&s;tingui&s;hing Chronological, and Chorographical Characters, re&s;pecting the Four Fields into which the World is parted.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t the Go&s;pel was Preached in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> where this precious. Seed was quickly troden down and devoured; the Government &s;etting them&s;elves with all Earne&s;tne&s;s again&s;t it; and the body of the People, by a fatal Mi&s;take, willfully cha&s;ing away the Seeds|Men from them.</P>
<P>In <HI>Africa,</HI> the numerous flouri&s;hing Churches were quickly &s;corch'd and dryed up by the Vehement Heat of Per&s;ecution; not unlike the Gra&s;s in Summer, in that burning Clime. For then the Trees only dare &s;hew their heads; as <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> ob&s;erves.</P>
<P>In <HI>Europe,</HI> 'tis too well known how it was choaked with Worldly Hypocritical Intere&s;ts. Tho' it continued growing there; yet the&s;e Thorns rendred it, comparatively, Unfruitfull.</P>
<P>Why may we not, without being Envied, or derided, hope that the <HI>Americans</HI> &s;hall be made the good Ground that &s;hall once at la&s;t prove E&s;pecially, and Wonderfully fruitfull? 'Tis to be noted that the &s;ame order of the &s;everal &s;orts of Ground is ob&s;erved by all the Three Evangeli&s;ts. This Parable marches in the Front of
<PB N="5" REF="001647_0006_0FB3EC54E9C603F8">all the Parables; and a mention of the My&s;teries of the Kingdom, is annex'd to it in every Place of its Recital. I think [My&s;teries] appears not el&s;e-where in the Go&s;pels. In <HI>Mark,</HI> it is u&s;hered in with a note of Attention, <HI>Hearken!</HI> And in <HI>Matthew, Mark,</HI> and <HI>Luke,</HI> it hath for a Conclu&s;ion that Solemn Epiphonema, <HI>He that hath Ears to hear, let him bear.</HI> Our Saviour's going into a Ship to Preach, might intimate to his Country-men, that if they re|fu&s;ed to entertain his Doctrine; He would embark, and carry his de&s;pi&s;ed Go&s;pel to far-di&s;tant Regions. Indeed He has made great u&s;e of Ships in Propagating the Chri&s;tian Religion. <HI>Paul</HI> was carried in a Ship to <HI>Rome,</HI> where he had the advantage of Sowing the Truth all over the Empire. This is the only way whereby <HI>I&s;lands</HI> are Go&s;pelli&s;ed; and whereby, in a peculiar man|ner, the Kingdoms of the New World become the Kingdoms of our LORD, and of His CHRIST. 'Tis a great Encouragement to Mini&s;ters in the&s;e later Ages, to be diligent in Sowing, be|cau&s;e we have rea&s;on to believe that the Evening Seed will more abundantly pro&s;per, in <HI>A&s;is, Africa, Europe,</HI> and <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>Whether this be granted, or no; I am &s;ure it is well for the Aboriginal Natives of <HI>America,</HI> that the Apo&s;tle, who&s;e Emblem is the <HI>Eagle,</HI> who&s;e Character is <HI>Love;</HI> was in&s;tructed to begin his Go&s;pel with the Recognition of his Ma&s;ter's Title to the New World. For, if <HI>all</HI> Things were made by Him; and with|out Him was not <HI>any thing</HI> made that was made: Then <HI>America</HI> was made by Him, with all its Inhabitants in all their Sorrow|ful Circum&s;tances. This that we call the New World, was made by Him, tho' it knew Him not. And when he Vi&s;its tho&s;e that dwell in it. He comes to his Own. Oh that they would at la&s;t Receive Him! and that they might have Power given them to become the Sons of GOD, to believe in His Name! There is a fair Po&s;&s;ibility of their being made the happy Subjects of this Royal Privilege and Authority: for all Saints are <HI>born not of blood, nor of the Will of the fle&s;h, nor of the Will of Min; but of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>There is another portion of Scripture written by the &s;ame Apo&s;tle; the Tenth Chapter of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> which I now pa&s;s unto.</P>
<P>Altho' mo&s;t Expo&s;itors take the Angel therein mentioned, to be CHRIST, the great Angel of the Covenant; yet, among&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="001647_0007_0FB3EC5668F978B0">them that I have before me, <HI>Lyranus, John Bale, John Fox, Ribera, John Mayer, Cluverus,</HI> are otherwi&s;e minded. I &s;hall content my &s;elf with mentioning a few words of <HI>Bale,</HI> his Paraphra&s;e on this Chapter, fol. 139, 140. <HI>In the mid&s;t of this mo&s;t Vengeable time, wherein the Antichri&s;ts and Hypo|crites mo&s;t fiercly &s;tirreth about them to vex all the World with their fiery bla&s;ts, their filthy &s;moke and their &s;tinking Brim&s;tone, to re&s;tore again their plea&s;ant Euphrates: The Lord hath &s;ent to the comfort of his, certain peculiar and cho&s;en learned Men, mo&s;t con&s;tantly to defend his Verity: and them this pre&s;ent Revelation compareth to a &s;trong Angel. This Angel was cloathed with a Cloud, betokening the&s;e godly Supporters of the Lord's Truth to be compa&s;&s;ed with many hard Showers, and troublous Cro&s;&s;es of opprobrious Rebukes, Scorns, Slanders, Lies, and open Bla&s;phemies. And this Cloud hideth from the World all that is in them &s;piritual and godly, like as it did in Chri&s;t; that to many they &s;eem not that they are indeed.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Samuel Petto</HI> in his <HI>Revelation Unvaild,</HI> &s;peaks thus, <HI>I am per&s;waded that mo&s;t of the Vials are poured out before the Witne&s;&s;es Re|&s;urrection.</HI> p. 93. <HI>Aaron,</HI> and <HI>Peter had their falls, their blemi&s;hes: &s;o many pourers out of Vials, for the hardening of their Enemies, and humbling of them&s;elves; which here I intimate once for all.</HI> p. 102.</P>
<P>To this may be added all other Evils of Affliction where-with they are made black, and as our Proverb is, are under a Cloud. Yet this Darkne&s;s is irradiated with the brightne&s;s and &s;olace of the concomitant Rain-bow. And tho' the Storm increa&s;e and grow never &s;o Violent; yet this Angel per&s;i&s;ts with Courage and Con&s;tancy to Proclaim the certain approach of a Fair Day.</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> 2. <HI>And he &s;et his Right foot upon the Sea; and his Left foot on the Earth.</HI> I humbly conceive that in the Words there is a Di&s;tri|bution of the whole habitable Earth into the New and Old World; as if it had been &s;aid, He &s;et his Right foot upon <HI>America;</HI> and his Left foot, on <HI>A&s;ia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI> If we re&s;pect the quantity, the Di&s;tribution is not very unequal: for <HI>Brerewood</HI> makes the Proportion between the New and Old World, to be as Seven
<PB N="7" REF="001647_0008_0FB3EC57EA5D0FF0">is to Fifteen. And <HI>America</HI> is more di&s;tingui&s;hed and &s;eparated by the Sea, from <HI>A&s;ia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> than they are from each other. And in the Maps, <HI>America</HI> only and the adjacent Oceans are placed in the Right Hemi&s;phere. In the Opinion of the Ancients, the Sea it &s;elf occupied all that &s;pace.</P>
<P>And he &s;et his <HI>Right</HI> foot upon the <HI>Sea,</HI> but the <HI>Left</HI> upon the <HI>Earth</HI>] <HI>Id e&s;t, ad praedicandum trans Mare, et in univer&s;o orbe terrarum</HI> To Preach beyond Sea, and all the World over. Augu&s;tin, Tom. 9. Hom. 7. Col. 673. <HI>Pareus</HI> makes no que&s;tion but this &s;trong Angel is the &s;ame as <HI>Michael</HI> &s;tanding upon the Waters, and Swearing by the Living God, <HI>Daniel,</HI> 12. 7. From whence this part of the Vi&s;ion &s;eems to be taken. &mdash; Therefore this Angel is either CHRIST him&s;elf, or to be &s;ure, an Angel repre&s;enting the Per&s;on of CHRIST.</P>
<P>To <HI>Set the Foot</HI> any where, is to challenge Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Domi|nion.

It was infinitely profitable for the New World to be Entered upon, and Sei&s;ed for CHRIST: Yet &s;uch was the indi&s;po&s;ition and Aver&s;ene&s;s of its Inhabitants; that it behoved this &s;trong Angel to put forth his Strength, and to Set the be&s;t foot foremo&s;t.</P>
<P>If this Interpretation prove true, there will be this Advantage by it, the Chronology of Expo&s;itions on the Revelation will be thereby Rectified. The Time of this Mighty Angel, his Setting his Right Foot on the <HI>Sea,</HI> cannot probably be earlier than the Year of our Lord GOD, One Thou&s;and Four Hundred Ninety and Two, when <HI>Chri&s;topher Columbus,</HI> by his Di&s;covery of it, brought the New World into Acquaintance with the Old.</P>

This &s;eams to be much out of Time. And indeed, the appearance of this Angel, the Slaughter of the Witne&s;&s;es, the Drying up of Euphrates, and the Conver&s;ion of the Jews may fall in very clo&s;e together. It is matter of &s;trong Con&s;olation to the Two Witne&s;&s;es, in the pro&s;pect they have of their ap|proaching Death, that they cannot be held long under the Power of it; and that their Death &s;hall u&s;her in &s;o great and glorious a Birth. This quick and &s;udden Birth of the Hebrews, will make the Witne&s;&s;es to forget their Sorrows; and animate them to lay by their Sack cloth, and joyfully to undertake a mo&s;t illu&s;trious Reiteration of their Prophe&s;ie.</P>

<Q><P>Only in the Witne&s;&s;es of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> both the Light and Heat of Religion have been kept up and increa&s;ed; and among them only hath the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Power of Godline&s;s been con|tinued, with difference from the Croud of Common Profe&s;&s;ors. And (according to what appears in view) more of &s;uch true Witne&s;&s;es now in the&s;e la&s;t days (wherein this Slaughter is to fall out) are to be found in it, and belonging unto it, than in all the Reformed Churches be&s;ides; and that according to the Te&s;timony which they of tho&s;e Churches (who in the&s;e times of Scattering have come hither for Refuge) have, and do give. And &s;urely, the Place of this Killing the Witne&s;&s;es,

<P>An anonymous French Divine, &s;aid to be Mr. <HI>Phillipot,</HI> who writ in the Year 1685. finds the Witne&s;&s;es in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Peter Jurieu</HI> Expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus; <Q><HI>The bodies of the two Witne&s;&s;es &s;hall lye in the Street of the Great City.</HI> 'Tis to be ob&s;erved, that in the Text, 'tis not <HI>in the Streets,</HI> in the Plural, as the <HI>French</HI> Tran&s;lation reads: 'Tis <HI>in the Street,</HI> in the Singular. And I cannot hinder my &s;elf from believing, that this hath a particular regard to <HI>France,</HI> which at this day is certainly the mo&s;t eminent Country which belongs to the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Kingdom. &mdash; And I believe, that 'tis particularly in <HI>France</HI> that the <HI>Witne&s;&s;es mu&s;t remain Dead,</HI> i. e. that the Profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>True Religion</HI> mu&s;t be utterly aboli&s;ht. This is already done by the Revocation of the <HI>Edict of Nantes,</HI> and by the enormous Cruelties of the <HI>Souldiers,</HI> who have been let loo&s;e upon the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> of what&s;oever Sex, Quality, and Condition.</Q> <BIBL><HI>Accompl. of Prophecies,</HI> p. 247, 248.</BIBL> But it mu&s;t be Con&s;ider'd, The <HI>Bad</HI> mu&s;t be taken with the <HI>Good.</HI> They that have the Credit of having the <HI>Witne&s;&s;es,</HI> mu&s;t brook the Di&s;credit of having the <HI>Slayers of the Witne&s;&s;es:</HI> For where JESUS is, there <HI>Judas</HI> mu&s;t al&s;o be; that he may be Nigh, and betray with a Ki&s;s!</P>
<P>Rev. 11. 8. <HI>The great City</HI>] I enquire whether this can be con|veniently Under&s;tood of <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf, or of the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Ju|ri&s;diction? It &s;eems probable, that &s;eeing the Bea&s;t is to &s;lay the Witne&s;&s;es, they mu&s;t be, and mu&s;t be &s;lain within the compa&s;s of the Bea&s;t's Juri&s;diction; if they were out of it, they would not be within reach. But if the Great City &s;o graphically de&s;cribed, prove to be &s;ome more peculiar and limited Juri&s;diction; the In|digitation of the Holy Gho&s;t will appear with much more Par|ticularity and Di&s;tinction; Per&s;ons will be directed which way to look, that they may behold this &s;ad Spectacle. Now, may not the
<PB N="11" REF="001647_0012_0FB3EC5DF4A66C90">Juri&s;diction of GREAT BRITAIN be this Great City? Ever &s;ince the Acts of the Parliaments which made the Union, this Juri&s;|diction has been Great both in <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Thing;</HI> Great in the I&s;lands, which are the Seat of the Empire, at Home; and Great in the I&s;lands and Continent of its Plantations, abroad. If the Elaborat Calculations of my Learned Country man Sir <HI>William Petry</HI> be Credited, <HI>LONDON,</HI> the Metropolis, is not only a Great City; but it excels in Greatne&s;s, if compar'd with <HI>Paris,</HI> or <HI>Rome.</HI> And if the Regal Style in its Compleatne&s;s [GREAT BRITAIN, FRANCE, and IRELAND] be regarded; it will certainly be allow'd to be a Great Juri&s;diction. This propo&s;al being admitted, what is Spoken of this Great City in the 13th ver&s;e of this Chapter, will be more ea&s;ily accounted for.</P>
<P>Revel. 16. 19. This <HI>Great City</HI> is generally taken to be the &s;ame that is &s;poken of, <HI>Rev.</HI> 11. 8. To me it &s;eems to be mentioned as divers from great <HI>Babylon. And the Great City was divided into Three parts,</HI> [<HI>was made into three parts,</HI> as the Vulgar Latin, <HI>Stephanus,</HI> and the <HI>Rhemi&s;ts</HI> Tran&s;late] <HI>and the Cities of the Nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the Cup of the Wine of the furceness of his Wrath.</HI></P>
<P>No Argument taken from the&s;e Words, for the De&s;truction of the <HI>Great City,</HI> can be cogent: they admit of a Favourable Interpreta|tion. There are Three di&s;tinct Articles in the Ver&s;e; and to each of them a very di&s;tinct Event is a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P><HI>Alca&s;ar</HI> mentions &s;ome Expo&s;itors that take this great City, and Babylon, to be two di&s;tinct Cities. <Q>Nonnulli cum Areta <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> per&s;uadent, non c&s;&s;e unam eandemque urbem; &s;ed duas diver&s;as, quae in ver&s;iculo a&s;&s;ignantur. &mdash; Hanc juva<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> conjecturam interpo&s;itio eorum verborum, <HI>Et civitates Gentium c<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">dount</HI> quae inter utramque partem &s;unt interjecta.

<P>As the Cities are divers, and not the &s;ame &s;o the Di&s;pen&s;ation
