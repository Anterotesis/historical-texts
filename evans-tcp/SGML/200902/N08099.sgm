<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends, Brethren and Si&s;ters,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is in my Mind, by way of Introduction to the following EXTRACTS, to remind us of one of the principal Ends of our peculiar Call by the Spirit of God, from the Spirit of the World, to be a People &s;eperate from the many religious Names, as well as their corrupt Nature; called of God, (to exhibit an Example of Righteou&s;ne&s;s to the World)

<P>Was this then one great Purpo&s;e of our high and holy Calling, as a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Society in general, and the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> in particular? Mo&s;t certainly yes. Then it is evident, that our Concern for temporal, &s;piritual, and eternal Things, is not to be limited to our&s;elves; no Man is born merely for him&s;elf, and no Man lives or dies to him&s;elf; but his Life and Death hath a Tendency to promote Good or Evil. Our Views were intended, by divine Wi&s;dom, to be directed in the fir&s;t Place, to the Honour of God; in the next, to our own Benefit, and the Good of our Brethren and fellow Creatures; and therefore the Apo&s;tle enjoins the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Converts, <HI>to do all Things to the Glory of God;</HI> and cautions them again&s;t <HI>&s;eeking only their own Things,</HI> but bids every Man <HI>look al&s;o on the things of others;</HI> which he thus farther

And how much greater is this Obligation on <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Elders,</HI> to whom the Care, In&s;truction, exampling, feeding and Over&s;ight of the Flock, Family or Church of Chri&s;t, is committed?

Where's the Self-denial you pretend to? Don't you gratify the Lu&s;t of the Eye, and Pride of Life, though plain, yet in rich and co&s;tly Silks, and the fine&s;t of Linen?

<P>Ob&s;erve, <HI>Dear Friends,</HI> how we are reproached now, not for <HI>reforming,</HI> but <HI>conforming</HI> to the World in many Re&s;pects; and though there has been &s;o much Labour be&s;towed to convince the World of our <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Principles, and what great Self-denial they lead to, we can't deny that they have abundant Rea&s;on to &s;ay as they do of many; <HI>They are contra|dicting them them&s;elves.</HI> And now, <HI>dear Friends,</HI> per|mit me to &s;ay, while by Practice any of us thus do, whatever our Station be in the Church, whether pub|lick or private, both Profe&s;&s;ion and Preaching will be vain; the People it is to be feared, will remain in Unbelief. And I farther add, I do not commu|nicate the&s;e Things to you with any other View, than that of a long wi&s;hed for Reformation in our poor declining Society; that tho&s;e by whom Offences come, might no longer offend again&s;t the Light, the

<P><HI>And here let me add a Remark of the foregoing Author, for the Admonition or In&s;truction of the Youth of our Society.</HI>&mdash;His Wife's Parents were convinc|ed of Truth before &s;he was; yet &s;he had that reve|rend Re&s;pect for them, that &s;he would not willing|ly appear before them in any Dre&s;s they did not like; and in a little Time &s;he and her Si&s;ters were convinced.</P>

<P>IN the Feeling of that Love that hath vi&s;ited our Hearts, do I de&s;ire to &s;alute you: Since I had the Occa&s;ion to &s;ee &s;ome of your Faces, you have been often before me in that which de&s;ires the Pro&s;perity of the good and holy Work of Truth, that our God in his Mercy hath begun in and among&s;t us, and honoured us to be as a fir&s;t Fruits unto him&s;elf: Therein I feel this Concern increa&s;eth, &s;o that I could not &s;afely forbear, but in Obedience to that which rai&s;ed this Concern in my Heart, do I write unto you as followeth:</P>
<P>Since the Lord our God hath been plea&s;ed to take from among us many of our ancient Brethren and Si&s;ters in the Truth, who had a great Concern on them for the going on of this Work in the Purity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, let us that are behind be carful of the Work of God in us, and among&s;t us; that we may &s;tand up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Faithfulne&s;s of Heart in their Rooms, in this our Day of God's Love to us. O you Elders in the Truth, and Parents of Children, my Call is unto you; &s;tand up in the Authority that God giveth you, in the Meekne&s;s and Wi&s;dom of God, and in your Places acquit your&s;elves as becomes you, in Obedience to God, and therein an&s;wer your Duty towards your Youth. We know that God's Power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> near, that giveth to know, and enableth us to an&s;wer our Duty in all Things, as we keep in Sub|jection

our Minds to it; &s;o let us all be careful in our Places to keep to the Power, that therein we may be good Examples to one another, laying a&s;ide, and keeping out of all [<HI>Superfluity</HI> or] Superfluous Things; for we know that in Mercy we were brought in at the right Door: And there was no le&s;s called for at our Hands, in our fir&s;t Vi&s;itation of God's Love and Light, than to come out of all Superfluity. So in the &s;ame pure Way mu&s;t we hold on, and have weighty Care to train up our Youth therein, to go on with us in it, that we and ours may be given up to the Lord, (who hath vi&s;ited us in his Love) for we and ours are the Offering due to our God, and he requires it of us. O my <HI>dear Friends,</HI> let no le&s;s be our Offering to him <HI>than our All.</HI> This is the pre&s;ent Breathing of my Heart before him. For what is or can be our Children to us, but as they are in the Truth, that brings forth a &s;ober and &s;erious Conver&s;ation in it? Therein only can they be a Comfort to the upright in Heart. So let this Con|cern be more and more weighty on us Parents, School-ma&s;ters and School-mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. I feel it in my Heart in that which de&s;ireth I may be kept in the Concern my&s;elf, and in Obedience to that Power that rai&s;eth this good and weighty Concern, <HI>my Call is unto you all</HI> who have the Occa&s;ion to be concern'd in this weighty Work of bringing up Youth; have a &s;pecial Care that you an&s;wer your Duty in it, in the fir&s;t Place to God, and next to the Youth you are con|cerned with. I feel there is a great Matter of this Work lieth in your Hands, Parents, School-ma&s;ters and School-mi&s;tre&s;&s;es: O you have Need to know and keep your Watch continually, in the pure Spring of Life and Wi&s;dom, that you may know, and make a thorough Difference between the <HI>needful</HI> and the <HI>needle&s;s</HI> and &s;uperfluous Things, either in Meats, Drinks and <HI>Apparel; and in that which ye teach them for the Employment of their Hands.</HI></P>

I charge you in the Sight of that Power that &s;earches the Depths of our Hearts, <HI>that you neither teach, allow nor &s;uffer the &s;uperfluous or vain Thing among&s;t you:</HI> For your Families ought to be as young Nur&s;eries to the Lord, and then your Endeavours with them &s;hall be known for Good, in the Fami|lies they fall to be in.</P>
<P>And O you Youth! how &s;hall I ea&s;e my Mind concerning you! for your Sakes, and on your Be|half, am I often as one who hath her Hands upon her Loins, and as in Pain for your Sakes, that you may more and more come forth out of that which hinders you from &s;erving God in your Generation in a &s;in|cere Heart; for a Profe&s;&s;ion alone will not do, or &s;erve. Therefore ari&s;e in Uprightne&s;s of Heart, and &s;hake your&s;elves from that which hinders and di&s;or|ders the Mind as to its following God in Obedience: And, as wi&s;e Virgins in a cha&s;te Mind to God, let us both Old and Young wait more and more to feel in his Virtue and Power our Light increa&s;ed, and we, as Lamps, fill'd with the Oil of the Go&s;pel; that therein we may know a putting on of the Wedding Garment of true Holine&s;s, which will make us ac|ceptable in the Sight of our God.

<P><HI>John Hall,</HI> Father of <HI>David Hall</HI> of <HI>Skipton,</HI> lately decea&s;ed, born in 1637, a <HI>Taylor</HI> by Trade, was often employed in the Families of great Men and Circum|&s;tances, had in great E&s;teem among&s;t them, being wil|ling, capable and ready to gratify them in the Modes, Cuts and Superfluities of the Times, being him&s;elf at that Time a Youth gay and modi&s;h in Apparel, &s;prightly and jovial in Spirit, &s;wimming towards the Profits and Plea&s;ures of this fading World; yet pre|&s;erved from gro&s;s Enormities, was awakened by one <HI>Gerva&s;e Be&s;on:</HI> Some Time after, in a &s;ilent Meeting, convinced of the ble&s;&s;ed Truth, and continued in it to his dying Day.

<PB N="73" REF="010337_0073_0F7E80CCD339AD38">
found a Re&s;triction laid upon him, and a con&s;cientious Scruple in doing &s;uch like Things: Howbeit, for &s;ome Time, through Rea&s;oning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> permitted his Servant or Servants that wrought with him to have &s;ome hand in the doing of it. He did not at the fir&s;t renounce all tho&s;e Superfluities, and the Profits that might &s;eem to ari&s;e therefrom, but the Light &s;hone brighter and brighter, and di&s;covered Things further and further; and as he &s;at in a Meeting on a certain Day (<HI>the Power of the Lord &s;eized him</HI>) he was &s;o remarkably affected, that his Hands were drawn together, the U&s;e of his Limbs taken from him, and he fell down on the Floor, where he laid for &s;ome Time, to the Admiration of the Spectators. After this <HI>Vi&s;itation,</HI> which he took to be a Di&s;pen|&s;ation of the righteous Judgments of the Lord, for his being in&s;trumental in &s;etting on of Lace on Womens Apparel, and other Superfluities of the Times, which frequently occur'd in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, he was &s;weetly favoured with an immediate Succe&s;&s;ion pf refre&s;hing Con&s;olation, &s;o that he could &s;ing of Judgment and Mercy.

<P>Soon after this, he was &s;ent for by a great Man to make &s;ome very fine Clothes; when he &s;aw the Work was to be wrought with many Superfluities, which for Con&s;cience-&s;ake he dur&s;t not undertake, upon his Refu&s;al they told him, he might let his

He was willing to lo&s;e all rather than his Peace with the Lord: He freely turn'd his Back of all that worldly Intere&s;t: And Providence &s;o favoured his con&s;cientious Care, that he got plan Work enough, and his Wages increa&s;ed; as he was faithful in a little, the Lord made greater Things manife&s;t unto him, for in the Families in which he had been light, airy and wanton, he was now made to reprove Vanity, and bear a living Te&s;timony to the everla&s;ting God in Word, Doc|trine, Life and Conver&s;ation; and it plea&s;ed the Lord to di&s;pen&s;e to him a Gift or Talent in the free living Mini&s;try of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which through his Ble&s;&s;ing he improved to God's Honour and the Comfort of Souls. He recruited in the World and lived reputably among his Neighbours; but the Officers were very rigorous in the Execution of the Law upon him, and in the Year 1683 was &s;everal Times in Pri&s;on, but the Lord made way for him and all that faithfully follow him, let their Difficulties be what they may.
