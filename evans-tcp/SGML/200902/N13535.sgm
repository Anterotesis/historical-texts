<HEAD>NOTES ON THE SLAVE TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>IT may not be nece&s;&s;ary to repeat what has been &s;o fully declared in &s;everal mo|dern publications, of the incon&s;i&s;tence of &s;la|very with every right of mankind, with e|very feeling of humanity, and every precept of Chri&s;tianity; nor to point out its incon|&s;i&s;tency with the welfare, peace and pro&s;|perity of every country, in proportion as it prevails; what grievous &s;ufferings it brings on the poor NEGROES; but more e&s;pecially what a train of fatal vices it produces in their lordly oppre&s;&s;ors and their unhappy off|&s;pring. Neverthele&s;s for the &s;ake of &s;ome who have not met with, or fully con&s;idered tho&s;e former publications, and in hopes that &s;ome who are &s;till active in &s;upport of &s;lavery may be induced to con&s;ider their ways, and become more wi&s;e, the following &s;ub&s;tance of an addre&s;s or expo&s;tulation made by a &s;en&s;ible Author, to the &s;everal ranks of per|&s;ons mo&s;t immediately concerned in the trade, is now republi&s;hed.</P>
<P>"And fir&s;t, to the Captains employed in this trade. Mo&s;t of you know the country of Guinea, perhaps now by your means, part of it is become a dreary uncultivated wilder|ne&s;s; the inhabitants being murdered or car|ried away, &s;o that there are few left to till
<PB N="2" REF="017095_0002_0F9FC47C27541998">the ground; but you know, or have heard, how populous, how fruitful, how plea&s;ant it was a few years ago. You know the peo|ple were not &s;tupid, not wanting in &s;en&s;e, con&s;idering the few means of improvement they enjoyed. Neither did you find them &s;avage, treacherous, or unkind to &s;trangers. On the contrary they were in mo&s;t parts a &s;en&s;ible and ingenious people; kind and friendly, and generally ju&s;t in their dealings. Such are the men whom you hire their own countrymen to tear away from this lovely country; part by &s;tealth, part by force, part made captives in tho&s;e wars which you rai&s;e or foment on purpo&s;e. You have &s;een them torn away, children from their parents, pa|rents from their children: Hu&s;bands from their wives, wives from their beloved hu&s;|bands; brethren and &s;i&s;ters from each other. You have dragged them who had never done you any wrong, perhaps in chains, from their native &s;hore. You have forced them into your &s;hips, like an herd of &s;wine, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following relation is in&s;erted at the reque&s;t of the author.</P>
<P><Q>That I may contribute all in my power towards the good of mankind, by in&s;piring any of its individuals with a &s;uit|able abhorrence for that dete&s;table practice of trading in our fellow creatures, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure at tone for my neglect of duty as a chri&s;tian, in engaging in a wicked traffic, I offer to their &s;erious con&s;ideration, &s;ome few occurrences of which I was an eye witne&s;s. That being &s;truck with the wretched and affecting &s;cene they may fo&s;ter that humane principle, which is the noble and di&s;tingui&s;hed characteri&s;tic of man.</Q></P>
<P>About the year <HI>1749;</HI> I &s;ailed from Liverpool to the coa&s;t of Guinea, &s;ome time after our arrival, I was ordered to go up the country a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, upon having notice from one of the Negroe Kings, that he had a parcel of &s;laves to di&s;|po&s;e of, I received my in&s;tructions and went, carrying with me an account of &s;uch goods we had on board, to exchange for the &s;laves we intended to purcha&s;e; upon being introduced, I pre|&s;ented him with a &s;mall ca&s;e of &s;pirits, a gun and &s;ome trifles, which having accepted, and under&s;tood by an interpreter what goods we had, the next day was appointed for viewing the Slaves; we found about two hundred confined in one place. But here how &s;hall I relate the affecting &s;ight I there beheld, the &s;ilent &s;orrow which appeared in the countenance of the af|flicted father, and the painful angui&s;h of the tender mother, expecting to be forever &s;eparated from their tender offspring; the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed maid wringing her hands in pre&s;age of her future wretchedne&s;s, and the general cry of the innocent, from a fear|ful apprehen&s;ion of the perpetual Slavery to which they were doomed. I purcha&s;ed eleven, who I conducted, tied two and two, to our &s;hip. Being but a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el (ninety ton) we &s;oon purcha&s;ed our cargo, con&s;i&s;ting of one hundred and &s;eventy Slaves, whom thou may'&s;t reader range in thy view, as they were &s;hackled two and two together, pent up within the nar|row confines of the main deck, with the complicated di&s;tre&s;s of &s;ickne&s;s, chains and contempt; deprived of every fond and &s;o|cial tie and in a great mea&s;ure reduced to a &s;tate of de&s;peration. We had not been a fortnight at &s;ea, before the fatal con&s;e|quence of this de&s;pair appeared, they formed a de&s;ign of reco|vering their natural right, Liberty, by rai&s;ing and murdering every man on board; but the goodne&s;s of the Almighty render|ed their &s;cheme abortive, and his mercy &s;pared us to have time to repent: The plot was di&s;covered; the ring leader tied by the two thumbs over the barricado door, at &s;un ri&s;e received a number of la&s;hes; in this &s;ituation he remained till &s;un-&s;et, expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults and barbarity of the brutal crew of &s;ail|ors, with full leave to exerci&s;e their cruelty at plea&s;ure: The con&s;equence was, the next morning the mi&s;erable &s;ufferer was found dead, &s;teed from the &s;houlders to the wai&s;t. The next victim was a youth, who from too &s;trong a &s;en&s;e of his mi|&s;ery refu&s;ed nouri&s;hment and died di&s;regarded and unnoticed till the hogs bad fed on part of his fle&s;h.</P></NOTE> them who
<PB N="3" REF="017095_0003_0F9FC47CB63AFEE0">had &s;ouls immortal as your own. You have &s;towed them together as clo&s;e as ever they could lie, without any regard to decency or conveniency&mdash;And when many of them had been poi&s;oned by foul air, or had &s;unk un|der various hard&s;hips, <Q>you have &s;een their remains delivered to the deep, till the &s;ea &s;hould give up his dead.</Q> You have carried the &s;urvivors into the vile&s;t &s;lavery, never to end but with life: Such &s;lavery as is not found among the Turks at Algiers, no, nor among the heathens in America.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="017095_0004_0F9FC47D897B9108">
<P>May I &s;peak plainly to you? I mu&s;t. Love con&s;trains me: Love to you, as well, as tho&s;e you are concerned with. Is there a God? You know there is. Is he a ju&s;t God? Then there mu&s;t be a &s;tate of retribution: A &s;tate where|in the ju&s;t God will reward every man ac|cording to his work. Then what reward will he render to you. O think betimes! be|fore you drop into eternity: Think how, <Q>He &s;hall have judgment without mercy, that &s;hewed no mercy.</Q> Are you a man? Then you &s;hould have a human heart. But have you indeed? What is your heart made
<PB N="5" REF="017095_0005_0F9FC480292A3D10">of? Is there no &s;uch principle as compa&s;&s;ion there? Do you never feel another's pain? Have you no &s;ympathy? No &s;en&s;e of human woe? No pity for the mi&s;erable? When you &s;aw the flowing eyes, the heaving bre&s;t, or the bleeding &s;ides and tortured limbs of your fellow-creatures. Was you a &s;tone or a brute? Did you look upon them with the eyes of a tiger? When you &s;queezed the a|gonizing creatures down in the &s;hip, or when you threw their poor mangled remains into the &s;ea, had you no relentings? Did not one tear drop from your eye, one &s;igh e|&s;cape from your brea&s;t? Do you feel no re|lenting now? If you do not, you mu&s;t go on till the mea&s;ure of your iniquities is full. Then will the great God deal with you, as you have dealt with them, and require all their blood at your hands. And at that day it &s;hall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah than for you: But if your heart does relent; tho' in a &s;mall degree, know it is a call from the God of Love. And to-day, if you hear his voice, harden not your heart&mdash;To day re&s;olve, God being your helper to e&s;cape for your life&mdash;Regard not money: All that a man hath will he give for his life. Whatever you lo&s;e, lo&s;e not your &s;oul; nothing can countervail that lo&s;s.
<PB N="6" REF="017095_0006_0F9FC4812E25B880">Immediately quit the horrid trade: At all events be an hone&s;t man.</P>
<P>This equally concerns every merchant who is engaged in the &s;lave-trade. It is you that induce the African villain to &s;ell his countrymen; and in order thereto, to &s;teal, rob, murder men, women and children without number: by enabling the Engli&s;h villain to pay him for &s;o doing; whom you over pay for his execrable labour. It is your money, that is the &s;pring of all, that impow|ers him to go on, &s;o that whatever he or the African does in this matter, is all your act and deed. And is your con&s;cience quite re|conciled to this? Does it never reproach you at all? Has gold entirely blinded your eyes and &s;tupified your heart? Can you &s;ee, can you feel no harm therein? Is it doing as you would be done to? Make the ca&s;e your own. <Q>Ma&s;ter (&s;aid a &s;lave at Liverpool to the merchant that owned him) what if &s;ome of my countrymen were to come here, and take away my mi&s;tre&s;s, and ma&s;ter Tommy and ma&s;ter Billy, and carry them into our country and make them &s;laves, how would you like it?</Q> His an&s;wer was worthy of a man: <Q>I will never buy a &s;lave more while I live.</Q> O let his re&s;olution be yours! Have no more any part in this
<PB N="7" REF="017095_0007_0F9FC48138166600">dete&s;table bu&s;ine&s;s. In&s;tantly leave it to tho&s;e unfeeling wretches, <Q>who laugh at humanity and compa&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>And this equally concerns every per&s;on who has an e&s;tate in our American plantati|ons: Yea all &s;lave-holders of whatever rank and degree; &s;eeing men-buyers are exactly on a level with men-&s;tealers. Indeed you &s;ay, <Q>I pay hone&s;tly for my goods; and I am not concerned to know how they are come by.</Q> Nay but you are: You are deeply concerned, to know that they are not &s;tolen: Otherwi&s;e you are partaker with a thief, and are not a jot hone&s;ter than him. But you know they are not hone&s;tly come by: You know they are procured by means nothing near &s;o innocent as picking of pock|ets, hou&s;e breaking, or robbery upon the highway. You know they are procured by a deliberate &s;eries of more complicated vil|lainy (of fraud, robbery and murder) than was ever practi&s;ed either by Mahometans or Pagans; in particular by murders of all kinds; by the blood of the innocent poured upon the ground like water. Now it is your money that pays the merchant, and thro' him the captain and African butchers. You therefore are guilty: Yea principally guilty, of all the&s;e frauds, robberies, and murders. You are the &s;pring that puts all the re&s;t in
<PB N="8" REF="017095_0008_0F9FC4821A88B980">motion; they would not &s;tir a &s;tep without you &mdash; There|fore the blood of all the&s;e wretches, who die before their time, whether in their country or el&s;ewhere, lies upon your head. The blood of thy brother, (for whether thou wilt believe it or no, &s;uch he is in the &s;ight of him that made him) crieth again&s;t thee from the earth, from the &s;hip and from the waters. O! whatever it co&s;t, put a &s;top to its cry, before it be too late. In&s;tantly, at any price, were it the half of thy goods, deliver thy &s;elf from blood guiltine&s;s! Thy hands, thy bed, thy furniture, thy hou&s;e, thy land, are at pre&s;ent &s;tained with blood. Surely it is enough; accumulate no more guilt: Spill no more the blood of the innocent! Do not hire another to &s;hed blood! Do not pay him for doing it! Whether thou art a Chri&s;tian or no, &s;hew thy &s;elf a man; be not more &s;avage than a lion or a bear.</P>
<P>Perhaps thou wilt &s;ay, <Q>I do not buy any NEGROES: I only u&s;e tho&s;e left me by my father.</Q> But is it enough to &s;atisfy your own con&s;cience! Had your father, have you, has any man living, a right to u&s;e another as a Slave? It cannot be, even &s;etting REVELATION a&s;ide. It cannot be, that either war, or contract, can give any man &s;uch a property in another as he has in his &s;heep and oxen: Much le&s;s is it po&s;&s;ible, that any child of man, &s;hould ever be born a Slave. Liberty is the right of every human creature, as &s;oon as he breathes the vital air. And no human law can deprive him of that right, which he de|rives from the law of nature. If therefore you have any regard to ju&s;tice, (to &s;ay nothing of mercy, nor of the re|vealed law of GOD) render unto all their due. Give Li|berty to whom Liberty is due, that is to every child of man, to every partaker of human nature. Let none &s;erve you but by his own act and deed, by his own voluntary choice, away with whips, chains, and all compul&s;ion. Be gentle towards all men. And &s;ee that you invariably do unto every one, as you would he &s;hould do unto you.</P>
