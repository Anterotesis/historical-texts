<HEAD>To the reverend Dr. LANGDON, Pre&s;ident of Harvard College.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Hon^d Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH but little apology, and perhaps with le&s;s mode&s;ty, I here expo&s;e to your peru&s;al a &s;hort juvenile performance, <HI>"the law given at Sinai."</HI> I offer it to you, Sir, not only as knowing your attachment to the &s;ublime original; but becau&s;e there is none to whom I &s;o much owe this tribute of gratitude.</P>
<Q><L>"Beneath the &s;hade of who&s;e paternal wing,</L>
<L>"I fir&s;t pre&s;um'd to touch the trembling &s;tring."</L></Q>
<P>At this lei&s;ure hour, perhaps, the mathematician is drawing his angle, and the logician his conclu&s;ion; and if the mu&s;e can catch one &s;prig from Parna&s;&s;us, I tru&s;t it may not be rejected. Whether this little &s;prig be genuine, I judge not.&mdash;If I have fail'd, my excu&s;e for offering it &s;hall be, that altho' I &s;hould have but one talent; and that talent be ever &s;o &s;mall, yet would I "not hide it beneath the &s;urface of the earth."&mdash;</P>

<L>THro' heaven's high courts the trump eternal roars&mdash;</L>
<L>Lift up your heads ye everla&s;ting doors;</L>
<L>And wait the GOD of Gods!&mdash;Lo, at the &s;ound,</L>
<L>Wide fly the portals, blazing all around.</L>
<L>And &s;ee he comes! adown the rending skies,</L>
<L>Borne on the whirlwind's rapid wing he flies,</L>
<L>Cherub and &s;eraphim prepare his way,</L>
<L>Black thunder rolls and livid lightnings play.</L>

<L>All nature trembles as they i&s;&s;ue down,</L>

<L>Tremendous &s;cene, oh how &s;hall men with&s;tand,</L>
<L>When GOD in thunder gives the world command!</L>
