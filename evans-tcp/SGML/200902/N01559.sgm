In the Hi&s;tory we may Ob&s;erve. (1.) <HI>Lazarus was Sick.</HI> He was one whom JESUS Loved, and yet was Sick.

We &s;hould be ready to &s;end for the Phy&s;ician: And above all, we &s;hould &s;end up our fervent Petitions to CHRIST upon the account of our Sick Friends, and Pray to Him, without whom all Phy&s;icians are of no value, to &s;end forth His Word and heal them. What is a Brother, or a Si&s;ter, if not born for &s;uch a day of Adver&s;ity? (3.) We have an account of <HI>the Journey CHRIST

We may take Notice of the tender <HI>Sympathy CHRIST had</HI> with his Mourning and Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Friends. It's &s;aid, <HI>JESUS Wept.</HI> CHRIST did truly partake of Humane Nature, and was made like unto us, Sin excepted. In the Afflictions of His People He was Afflicted.

And in particular, when we go to the Hou&s;es of Mour|ning, Let us do it with a becoming Solemnity; let us Mourn with them that Mourn, and labour to have a &s;uitable Compa&s;&s;ion for our Friends. (6.) We may take Notice of the Wonderful <HI>Miracle</HI> our Saviour wrought in rai&s;ing <HI>Lazarus</HI> from the Dead.

<Q>OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST is the Re&s;urrection, and the Life.</Q>
<P>THESE Expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>The Re&s;urrection and the Life,</HI> Are, in &s;ome re&s;pects, of the &s;ame importance, and do intend one and the &s;ame thing. However we may give each of them a di&s;tinct Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST is the RESUR|RECTION.</HI> Now when it's &s;aid that CHRIST is the Re&s;urrection, we may under&s;tand this to be the principal meaning of the Expre&s;&s;ion; <HI>viz.</HI> That the LORD JESUS CHRIST is the Author and Efficient cau&s;e of the Re&s;urrection. The Bo|dies of Men will be rai&s;ed out of their Graves by the Almighty Power of CHRIST. Man con|&s;i&s;ts of Two Parts, a Soul, which is a Spiritual, Indivi&s;ible, Immortal Sub&s;tance: And a Body, which was at fir&s;t form'd out of the Du&s;t, and mu&s;t return to Du&s;t again. When <HI>Adam</HI> had Sinned, GOD &s;aid unto him, Gen. 3.19. <HI>Dust thou art, and unto Dust thou &s;halt return.</HI> We all Sinned in him, and &s;o mu&s;t all ta&s;te of Death. Our Du&s;s will in a little time <HI>return to the Earth as it was; and the Spirit to GOD, who gave it.</HI> The&s;e near and dear Companions, the Soul and Body mu&s;t be &s;eparated: but they &s;hall not al|ways continue in this &s;tate of Seperation. No,

He will command the Earth and Sea to give up their Dead. He will gather the &s;cattered Du&s;t of the Dead Bodies of Men, and Fa&s;hion them a-new by His Power. He'l Com|mand <HI>the dry bones to live.</HI> He will cau&s;e <HI>Breath</HI> to enter <HI>into them, and they &s;hall live, and stand up an exceeding great Army:</HI> To allude to that, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.5, 10. CHRIST will in a literal &s;ence open their Graves, and bring them out of their Graves, and they &s;hall live. This the Scripture a&s;&s;ures us, Joh. 5.28, 29. <HI>Marvel not at this: For the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the Graves &s;hall hear his voice, and &s;hall come forth, they that have done good, unto the Re&s;urrection of Life; and they that have done evil unto the Re&s;urrection of Damnation.</HI> This Great and Wonderful Work of Rai&s;ing the Dead, belongs to CHRIST's Kingly Office. He is the LORD both of the Dead and Living. He hath the Keys of Death. And at the La&s;t Day He will open the Graves, and Command the Dead, both the Bodies of the Saints, and of the Wicked, to ari&s;e.

1. <HI>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST hath Purcha&s;ed a Glorious and Happy Re&s;urrection for His People.</HI> The Bodies of Men are by Sin expos'd to Ignominy and Di&s;grace. The Apo&s;tacy did not only de&s;troy the Divine Beauty of the <HI>Soul</HI> which con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in its Conformity to GOD <HI>in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s;</HI> but al&s;o it defac'd the Beauty of the <HI>Body,</HI> and in a great mea&s;ure mar'd it's Glory. The Bo|dies of Men are become vile and ignoble, Compa|ratively. Phil. 3.21. &mdash; <HI>Our vile Body</HI> &mdash; We may in this re&s;pect take up a Lamentation and &s;ay, <HI>The Crown is fallen from our heads; wo unto us that we have &s;inned.</HI> The whole Head is Sick; and the whole Heart faint. <HI>From the &s;ole of the foot even unto the head there is no &s;oundne&s;s.</HI> No Man enjoys perfect Health. And how often are the Bodies of Men the Seat and Subject of loath&s;ome Di&s;ea&s;es; of Wounds and Brui&s;es, and putrifying Sores; of great Weakne&s;s, and pining Sickne&s;s. And in a little time the&s;e Earthly Tabernacles mu&s;t Moulder down, and be Di&s;&s;olved. In a little time the Beauty and Glory that remains upon our Bodies will be laid in the Du&s;t, and Darkne&s;s and the Shadow of Death will &s;tain it. But the Son of GOD hath Purchas'd a Glorious Re&s;urrection for His People. The LORD JESUS CHRIST appear'd upon Earth in the likene&s;s of Sinful Fle&s;h. <HI>And tho' He was in the form of GOD, and thought it not robbery to be equal with GOD;</HI> yet He <HI>took upon Him the form of a &s;er|vant, became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cro&s;s.</HI> Tho' He was the LORD of Life and Glory, yet He Voluntarily &s;ubmitted to a &s;hameful &s;or|rowful Death. Now all this was, that the Saints might be Redeem'd from the power of the Grave: That the bands of Death might be loo&s;ed, and that they might be brought out of the Pri&s;on of the
<PB N="7" REF="001853_0008_0FB91C9E58768708">Grave. Zech. 9.11. <HI>By the Blood of thy Covenant I have &s;ent forth thy Pri&s;oners out of the Pit.</HI> By Dy|ing, CHRIST de&s;troy'd the power of Death. CHRIST Redeemed His People by Price; by His Active and Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience He Purchas'd this Glorious Re&s;urrection for them, with all the Excel|lent Endowments and Perfective Qualities of their Re&s;urrection-Bodies. And in this re&s;pect CHRIST may be called the <HI>Meritorious</HI> cau&s;e of the Re&s;urrecti|on of the Saints.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST Ro&s;e from the Dead, and &s;o became the Exemplar and Pattern of the Re&s;ur|rection, and the Fir&s;t-Fruits of them that &s;lept.</HI> The Son of GOD Ro&s;e again from the Dead by His <HI>own Power,</HI> Joh. 10.18. <HI>I have power to lay it down</HI> [<HI>my Life</HI>]. <HI>and I have power to take it again.</HI> As He offer'd up Him&s;elf to GOD <HI>through the Eternal Spirit,</HI> i. e. His Eternal God-Head, His Divine Nature; &s;o He aro&s;e again by the Almighty Power of the &s;ame Di|vine Nature. CHRIST rai&s;ed up the Temple of His Body by that Power which He hath in common with the Father and the Holy Spirit. <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.19. And then in the Re&s;urrection of His Body, the Son of GOD hath given us the <HI>Pattern</HI> and <HI>Exemplar</HI> accor|ding to which the Re&s;urrection-Bodies of His People &s;hall be Moulded and Fa&s;hioned. For their vile Bo|dies &s;hall be Changed and <HI>Fa&s;hioned like to CHRIST's Glorious Body.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, CHRIST by His Re&s;urrection is be|come the Fir&s;t-Fruits of them that &s;lept. 1 Cor. 15.20. <HI>But now is CHRIST ri&s;en from the dead, and become the fir&s;t-fruits of them that &s;lept.</HI> As the Fir&s;t-Fruits being offer'd to GOD, under the Law, &s;anctified the whole, and were al&s;o an Earne&s;t of the full Harve&s;t:
<PB N="8" REF="001853_0009_0FB91CA2D7149D78">&s;o in CHRIST's Re&s;urrection, the People of GOD have an <HI>Earne&s;t, Pledge,</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> of their <HI>own</HI> Re|&s;urrection to Glory and Immortality. Accordingly the Apo&s;tle argues in, 1 Cor. 15.12. <HI>Now if CHRIST be Preached that He ro&s;e from the Dead, how &s;ay &s;ome among you, that there is no Re&s;urrection of the Dead?</HI> The Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of it as a very ab&s;urd unrea|&s;onable thing to deny the Re&s;urrection of <HI>Believers,</HI> whenas there were &s;uch undeniable Proofs and Te&s;timonies of CHRIST's being rai&s;ed from the Dead. When our Saviour aro&s;e again, He brought forth Judgment unto Victory, and gave His Peo|ple an evident Demon&s;tration that He had conquer|ed Death in their behalf. For He ro&s;e from the Dead as a Publick Per&s;on, the Head and Repre&s;en|tative of all true Believers. They are the Mem|bers of CHRIST; and CHRIST My&s;tical is not perfected till all the Saints are ri&s;en. So that in CHRIST's Re&s;urrection Believers have an A&s;&s;urance of their own Re&s;urrection. When the Son of GOD, the Strong the Mighty Redeemer awoke out of Sleep, He took away the Gates of the Grave, and carried away the Bars of the Pit. And the Scrip|ture informs us, <HI>that the Graves were then open'd, and many Bodies of Saints which &s;lept, aro&s;e. And came out of the Graves after his Re&s;urrection,</HI> Mat. 27.52, 53. This Miraculous Work was a Specimen of the General Re&s;urrection; and a plain proof and In|dication of the Infinite Vertue of CHRIST's Death and Re&s;urrection.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST will at the La&s;t Day, rai&s;e the Dead Bodies of the Saints by His Al|mighty Power, as He is their Head and Redeemer.</HI> This will not be meerly an Act of His <HI>Common</HI> Sove|raign Power, as He is Head over all things: But
<PB N="9" REF="001853_0010_0FB91CA516AE9848">al&s;o an Act of <HI>Grace and e&s;pecial Favour,</HI> as He is their LORD Redeemer, and their Head. Vital powerful influences will flow from CHRIST as the Head of His body, the Church, unto His Members to quicken and rai&s;e their Dead Bodies, and to make them Incorruptible, Immortal, Glorious. This the Scripture doth abundantly declare; 1 Cor. 15.22, 45. <HI>For as in Adam all die, even &s;o in CHRIST &s;hall all be made alive. &mdash; The last Adam was made a quickning Spirit.</HI> Phil. 3.20, 21. <HI>For our Conver&s;ation is in Hea|ven, from whence al&s;o we look for the Saviour, the LORD JESUS CHRIST: who &s;hall change our vile Body, that it may be fa&s;hioned like unto his glorious Body, according to the working, whereby he is able even to &s;ubdue all things unto him&s;elf.</HI> CHRIST will adorn the Bodies of the Saints with the like Excellent and Glorious Qualities, with which His own Body is Beautified and Dignified: Not the &s;ame in <HI>Degree,</HI> but as to <HI>Kind:</HI> CHRIST's Body will mightily Excel in Glory. Another Signal Te&s;timony to the Re&s;ur|rection we have in the Old Te&s;tament. Job. 19.23. to 27. inclu&s;ively. <HI>Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were Printed in a Book! That they were graven with an iron Pen and Lead, in the Rock for ever! For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he &s;hall &s;tand at the latter Day upon the Earth. And though after my &s;kin, worms de&s;troy this Body, yet in my Fle&s;h &s;hall I &s;ee GOD: whom I &s;hall &s;ee for my &s;elf, and mine Eyes &s;hall behold, and not another; though my Reins <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;umed within me.</HI> Ob&s;erve here, with what an Au|gu&s;t Speech he u&s;hers in the Confe&s;&s;ion of his Faith, concerning the Re&s;urrection. He would have this great, important Truth Written in a Book, or Engraven upon &s;ome Monument that &s;hould be durable like the Pillars of Heaven, that &s;o it might be con&s;ecrated to Eternity, and handed down to the
<PB N="10" REF="001853_0011_0FB91CA6979CD878">late&s;t Po&s;terity, in Characters which Time &s;hould not be able to Efface. When Death, that great De|vourer, who&s;e Mouth is an open Sepulchre, hath done it's wor&s;t, de&s;troyed not only the outward Parts, the Skin and Fle&s;h; but al&s;o prey'd upon the more inward, vital Parts, the Reins; and brought Rot|tenne&s;s into the Bones, and con&s;umed the Marrow: Yet after all, the Son of GOD, that numbers the Hairs of our Heads, and knows all the Atoms that fly in the Air; that &s;eeth into the dark Rece&s;|&s;es of the Grave, and hath them open and naked to His All-&s;eeing Eye: He will pre&s;erve the &s;cat|tered Du&s;t of His People and out of this very Du&s;t, He will frame and fa&s;hion their Bodies, with cu|rious and wonderful Art; with Infinite and Di|vine Skill. But it is not my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, to E&s;&s;ay a De&s;cription of the Re&s;urrection-Body in it's Beauty and Glory, Strength and Agility, Immortali|ty and Incorruptibility; you may Read the 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. <HI>Chap.</HI> at your Lei&s;ure. Only we may take No|tice, that the Re&s;urrection-Bodies of the Saints will not be meer <HI>Aethereal Vehicles,</HI> or of &s;uch a fine Sub&s;tance as &s;hall e&s;cape the Sight, and become Invi&s;ible; No, No; They will be proper <HI>Organical Bodies. Job</HI> &s;ays, <HI>that though worms de&s;troy</HI> this <HI>Body, yet in</HI> My <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> &s;hall I &s;ee GOD, &mdash; <HI>And Mine Eyes &s;hall behold,</HI> and not another. Unle&s;s we acknowlege this, we in effect de&s;troy One E&s;&s;ential, Con&s;tituent Part of Man.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST is LIFE.</HI> Now this Expre&s;&s;ion as we hinted before, may be look'd upon as of the &s;ame Import and Signification with the former, and as Exegetical of it. However, having con&s;idered the former Expre&s;&s;ion in a &s;trict and pro|per Sen&s;e, as it re&s;pects the Re&s;urrection of the
<PB N="11" REF="001853_0012_0FB91CA816BC57D0">Body; we may &s;peak &s;omething, very briefly, unto this, without interfering with what hath been already &s;aid.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>CHRIST as GOD, is Life E&s;&s;entially.</HI> He is the Living GOD. All Degrees of Life are contained in Him by way of Eminency. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth a Full|ne&s;s of Life and Being, Unchangibly and Everla&s;t|ingly; without any po&s;&s;ibility of Decay, or the lea&s;t approach toward a Di&s;&s;olution. He is the Ever|living JEHOVAH, the Eternal I AM. His Life is in and of Him&s;elf. There are no Seeds or Principles of Corruption in His Nature; and nothing from without, that can in any Mea&s;ure di&s;turb, much le&s;s de&s;troy His Being. The Angels &s;hall never Die; But then GOD gave them their Being at fir&s;t, and they depend intirely upon Him for the Continuance of it: Did not He uphold them by putting His Ever|la&s;ting Arms underneath them, they would in&s;tant|ly &s;ink and retire into their fir&s;t State of Not|being. But CHRIST is altogether, and ab&s;olutely Independent upon any thing without Him&s;elf; both for Life and the Continuance of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>CHRIST is Life Cau&s;ally and Virtually.</HI> CHRIST as GOD, is the Univer&s;al Principle and Spring of Life. He is the Fountain, from whence all Kinds of Life flow, and are derived. <HI>In Him we live, and move, and have our being.</HI> He made all Things, and upholdeth them all in Being. He is the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of the Vegetative, Animal, and Rational Life. John 1, 3, 4. <HI>All things were made by Him, and without Him was not any thing made that was made. In Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.</HI> The Son of GOD gave Life to every Living Creature; He form'd the Spirit of Man within him which is the Candle of the Lord.</P>

3. <HI>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST is He is GOD Man Mediator, the Saviour and Redeemer of His People, is their Life.</HI> And this &s;eems to be principally intended in our Text. CHRIST is the Prince of Life. Joh. 14.6. <HI>JESUS &s;aith unto him, I am the way, and the truth and the life: no Man cometh to the Father but by Me.</HI> Sin hath cut us off from GOD, as He is the Fountain of Spiritual Life. And it's in CHRIST alone that this Fountain is opened to &s;uch Sinners as we are. CHRIST Died that His People might Live; and He ever lives to Communicate Life to them. He who is the true and faithful Witne&s;s te&s;tifies of Him|&s;elf, Rev. 1.18. <HI>I am He that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the Keys of Hell and of Death.</HI> CHRIST is a Prie&s;t, <HI>Who is made not after the Law of a carnal Commandment, but after the power of an endle&s;s Life,</HI> Heb. 7.16.

He gives this Light of Life to His People, that &s;at in the Region and Shadow of Death. Every true Be|liever hath a Spiritual Re&s;urrection thro' CHRIST. Joh. 5.25. <HI>Verily, Verily, I &s;ay unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the Dead &s;hall hear the voice of the Son of GOD: And they that hear &s;hall live.</HI></P>
<P>(2.) <HI>THROUGH CHRIST Believers who were Condemn'd to Die, receive the Justification of Life.</HI> Rom. 5.18. &mdash; The free Gi&s;t came upon all Men unto Ju&s;tification of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="001853_0014_0FB91CABD9C17D98">
(3) <HI>IT is through CHRIST that the Spiritual Life of GOD's People is maintained and increa&s;ed, till it be per|fected in Glory,</HI> Gal. 2.20. I am Crucified with CHRIST: Neverthele&s;s I live; yet not I, but CHRIST liveth in me: And the life which I now live in the fle&s;h, I live by the Faith of the Son of GOD, who loved me, and gave Him&s;elf for me. Believers receive tho&s;e vital Influences from CHRIST whereby the New Man is kept alive, fed and non|ri&s;h'd, till it be grown to the Stature of a perfect Man in CHRIST.</P>
<P>(4.) <HI>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST gives His People Everlasting Life.</HI> At the Great Day, Mortality &s;hall be &s;wallowed up of Life. Then CHRIST, who is the Life of His People, &s;hall appear. Then will their Life be perfected for ever; and they &s;hall enter upon the Heavenly Life, which &s;hall never never have an end. John 10.28. <HI>And I give unto them Eternal Life, and they &s;hall never Peri&s;h</HI> &mdash;</P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>USE I. <HI>LEARN what grent Rea&s;on we have to Ble&s;s GOD, in that we have the Go&s;pel, wherein CHRIST is Revealed and Offered to us.</HI> The Apo&s;tle &s;ays, that GOD Saved us, and Called us with an Holy Cal|ling not according to our Works, but according to His own Purpo&s;e and Grace, which was given us in CHRIST JESUS, before the World began; but is now made manife&s;t by the appearing of our Saviour JESUS CHRIST, who hath Aboli&s;hed Death, and hatl. brought Life and Immortality to light, through the Go&s;pel, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.9, 10. It's a great and un&s;peakable Favour to enjoy the Means
<PB N="14" REF="001853_0015_0FB91CAD5692F9F8">of obtaining an Intere&s;t in CHRIST; O let us take care to Pri&s;e and Improve them: And be Earne&s;t with GOD to Enlighten our Minds, that we may come to know GOD and CHRIST, whom to know is Life Eternal. John 5.39. <HI>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life, and they are they which testifie of Me.</HI> It's a wonderful Mercy that &s;uch Sinful, Mortal, Dying Creatures as we are, &s;hould have the Di&s;coveries of an Happy, and Glorious Re&s;urrection made to us through CHRIST. The Lord grant that it may not be &s;aid of us, that we refu&s;e to come to Him that we might have Life.</P>
<P>USE II. IS CHRIST the Re&s;urrection and the Life; Learn hence, <HI>That it is our great Intere&s;t as well as Duty, to employ all the Powers and Facul|ties of Soul and Body, in His Service.</HI> If we would hope to obtain an happy Re&s;urrection, we mu&s;t now Glorify GOD with our Souls and Bodies, which are His. It's our Intere&s;t to lay out our &s;elves to the utmo&s;t in the Work and Service of CHRIST. We &s;hould very gladly &s;pend and be &s;pent for CHRIST; Yea, be ready to Sacrifice our very Lives for His &s;ake, if His Glory calls for it for He will give all His Faithful Servants a much better Life than this we now enjoy. <HI>Be this faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of Life,</HI> Rev. 2.10. Let us take care to make our Bodies In&s;truments of Righteou&s;ne&s;s unto Holine&s;s. Let us improve the&s;e <HI>Earthen Ve&s;&s;els</HI> Diligently and Faithfully in Gods Service; and then CHRIST will One Day Refine them, and make them <HI>Ve&s;&s;els of Honour and Glory.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="001853_0016_0FB91CAF9E9DB138">
USE III. <HI>THIS Con&s;ideration &s;hould make the Children of GOD Patient, Submi&s;&s;ive, and Chearful, under all the Pains, Weakne&s;s, and Sickne&s;s, they &s;uffer in this Frail, Mortal State.</HI> The Children of GOD are &s;ubject to the &s;ame Infirmities and Bodily Pains as others are. They may many times &s;ay, that they have no Soundne&s;s in their Fle&s;h. Many times they may complain with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>That they are weak, and their Bones are vexed,</HI> P&s;al. 6.2. O Believer, ha&s;t thou frequent Returns of Pain and Illne&s;s? Well, &s;ee that you quietly and pa|tiently Re&s;ign up your &s;elf to the Soveraign Will of GOD. Do not Faint, or Fret, when thou art thus Rebuked of the LORD. Thy Redeemer is by the&s;e Afflictive Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence, preparing thee for an Happy Re&s;urrection. And when they <HI>Corruptible</HI> &s;hall have put on <HI>Incorruption,</HI> thou &s;halt never more complain of Sickne&s;s; but thy Health and Strength &s;hall be perfected for ever. Rev. 21.4. <HI>And GOD &s;hall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes; and there &s;hall be no more Death, nei|ther Sorrow nor Crying, neither &s;hall there be any more Pain, for the former things are pa&s;&s;ed away.</HI></P>
<P>USE IV. <HI>THIS &s;hould &s;upport the People of GOD undo the near Approaches of their own Death.</HI> There is a clo&s;e and very intimate Union between the Soul and Body, &s;o that a Di&s;&s;olution is dread|ful to Nature. But the Children of God &s;hould labour to overcome this Reluctancy by Faith in CHRIST, and a firm Belief of the Re&s;urrection. And Certainly, &s;eeing their Redeemer is the Re|&s;urrection and the Life, they have no need to <HI>fear any Evil</HI> with Amazement; <HI>though they &s;hould walk though the valley of the &s;hadow of Death.</HI> Do
<PB N="16" REF="001853_0017_0FB91CB1E0FD7EE0">any of the Children of GOD find their Earthly Tabernacles &s;o out of Repair, that they can't &s;tand long? Are the Infirmities of Age come upon you; <HI>Do the Keepers of the Hou&s;e tremble; Do the strong Men how them&s;elves, and the Grinders cea&s;e becau&s;e they are few; And are tho&s;e that look out of the Windows darkened?</HI> Be not afraid, encourage your &s;elves in the LORD JESUS CHRIST: Go out to meet the King of Terrors, leaning on your Beloved; Give all Diligence to make your Inte|re&s;t in CHRIST clear and evident to your Souls; Take your JESUS in the Arms of your Faith, and then with <HI>Simeon,</HI> Ble&s;s GOD, and &s;ay, <HI>Now lette&s;t thou Thy &s;ervant depart in Peace, according to Thy Word. For mine Eyes have &s;een Thy Salvation,</HI> Luk. 2.29, 30.</P>
<P>USE V. <HI>THIS &s;hould Comfort &s;uch as are Be|reaved of Pious Relatives.</HI> 1 The&s;. 4.13, 14. <HI>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are a&s;leep, that ye &s;orrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we Believe that JESUS died, and ro&s;e again; even &s;o them al&s;o which &s;leep in JESUS, will GOD bring with Him.</HI> The Children of GOD when they Die, <HI>Sleep</HI> in JESUS; and in the Morning of the Re&s;urrection, they &s;hall <HI>Awake</HI> to Everla&s;ting Life. <HI>Wherefore comfort one another with the&s;e Words.</HI></P>
<P>TO Conclude, O let us all Ble&s;s GOD for JESUS CHRIST; and &s;ee that we Receive Him who is the Re&s;urrection and the Life. Let us Pray to GOD to help us to Believe, and Realize this great, my&s;terious Truth. O that it were written on our Hearts with the Finger of GOD! Let us Pray to GOD that we <HI>may be begotten again unto</HI>

In a Dying Hour, &s;uch an Hope well Bottomed is worth Ten Thou&s;and Worlds. Let not the Amu&s;ements of this vain World, who's Fa&s;hion pa&s;&s;eth away, hinder us from laying hold of this Hope which is now &s;et before us through CHRIST. We are Mortal, Dy|ing Creatures; <HI>our Life is a Vapour,</HI> and we know not what a Day may bring forth. Let us then to Day, while it is called to Day, make ha&s;te to CHRIST. Let us now take care to walk in New|ne&s;s of Life; and then when we come to Die, we &s;hall have Hope in our Death. And at the Great Day CHRIST will Call, and we &s;hall An&s;wer Him; He will Rai&s;e our Bodies out of the Du&s;t, to Glory and Honour. This Corruptible, &s;hall put on Incorruption, this Mortal &s;hall put on Immor|tality; Death &s;hall be &s;wallowed up in Victory, and we &s;hall &s;ing that Triumphant Song, 1 Cor. 15.55, 57. <HI>O Deat, where is thy &s;ting?
