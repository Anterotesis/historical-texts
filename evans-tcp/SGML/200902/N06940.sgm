<HEAD>A Relation of the Oppo&s;ition which &s;ome Bapti&s;t People met with at <HI>Norwich, 1761,</HI> by the Authority and Mini&s;ter, when they went above ten Miles to confer with the People between their Meeting about the Things of God, upon which Oppo|&s;ition they went in the Middle of the Week on Purpo&s;e to de&s;ire &s;aid Mini&s;ter to appoint a Day to di&s;cour&s;e with one of them before the People. In particular they de&s;ired Liberty to &s;hew by the Scripture that the Fir&s;t Day of the Week is not the <HI>Chri&s;tian Sabbath,</HI> and to &s;hew by the Scripture what the Chri&s;tian Re&s;t or Chri&s;tian Sabbath is: And how Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper ought to be admini&s;tered, and what they are Figures of. And al&s;o to &s;hew &s;ome Scrip|ture Marks for People to know the Followers of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by, and &s;ome Scripture Marks to know fal&s;e Teachers by. But &s;aid Mini&s;ter would not hear to it, but in&s;tead, turned them cut of his Hou&s;e. There|fore they have here &s;hewed in Print what they de&s;ired to &s;hew by di&s;puting with him as followeth.</HEAD>
<P>WE appointed to go to <HI>Norwich</HI> Town, to have &s;ome Conference with the People between their Meet|ings, about the Things of God, and it happened that &s;ome of us came before the Forenoon Meeting began, and &s;at down near the Meeting-hou&s;e; when a Con&s;table came and a&s;ked us if we came to make a Di&s;turbance, one of us an&s;wered he came to te&s;tify again&s;t the Idol Sabbath; ano|ther &s;aid we did not come to make any Di&s;turbance. The Con&s;table went away, and pre&s;ently came again, and made Pri&s;oners of us, &s;etting Men to keep us at the Tavern; and before the Forenoon Meeting was done, the re&s;t of us came to the Meeting-hou&s;e, and when their Mini&s;ter <HI>Lord</HI> had done &s;peaking, we went within the Door and de&s;ired them to hear us read a Paper, but one an&s;wered we don't want to hear it; &s;o we went out, and de&s;ired them to hear it there, but the Con&s;table with others laid hold of us, and &s;et
<PB N="2" REF="008802_0002_102FCB33DAF5A838">
eighteen, and when it was dark Night the Con&s;table came and &s;aid, I have prevented your making a Di&s;turbance To|day, and now you are at Liberty.</P>
<P>So we being di&s;appointed of conferring with the People about the Things of God this Time, we appointed to go again, but it being a &s;tormy Day, but few went, and the Forenoon Meeting was done, and the People gone before they came; &s;o we went to a Tavern where a Ju&s;tice came to us before the Afternoon Meeting began, and a&s;ked if we were going to the Meeting, we an&s;wered we did not know that we &s;hould, and he immediately ordered Men to keep us, and when it was dark Night he came again and told us we were at Liberty; and &s;aid you would not like we &s;hould come to di&s;turb you at your Meeting: We an&s;wered, it would be wrong to come to di&s;turb, but we &s;hould be glad if you would come to our Meeting as we come to yours, to di&s;cour&s;e of the Things of God; and we are willing to ap|point a Meeting in this Town on Purpo&s;e to di&s;cour&s;e with us, and we went directly to their Mini&s;ter <HI>Lord</HI>'s Hou&s;e, to de&s;ire him to di&s;cour&s;e with us in the Week Time before the People, about their Sabbath; but before we could well inform him what we came for, he &s;aid I have nothing to do with you, and commanded us out, calling us unrea&s;onable Men, but which was the unrea&s;onable Man, let the Reader judge.</P>
<P>The next fir&s;t Day of the Week we went again, and &s;at down in the Meeting hou&s;e 'till &s;aid Lord had done &s;peak|ing, and one of us beginning to &s;peak, a Ju&s;tice told the People to di&s;per&s;e, and &s;aid Lord their Mini&s;ter told them it would prophane the Sabbath of the great God, for them to &s;top and hear us, calling us Praters, and when one of us &s;aid it is not the Sabbath of God, he an&s;wered, you are Madmen. And con&s;idering the Scripture teaches us to &s;peak in the Light which God hath made known to us, and not to hide it under a Bu&s;hel, we judged it be&s;t to di&s;pute with this Mini&s;ter before the People, that it might be made manife&s;t by the Scripture who were the Praters, that prate contrary to Scripture, he or we, and accordingly our Re|que&s;t was written and carried to his Hou&s;e by <HI>Jo&s;eph Bolles</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="008802_0003_102FCB409ECF4C70">
and others with him: and we told our Bu&s;ine&s;s and read the Paper to &s;everal Ju&s;tices and many others of his Society, and many liked it very well, and not one was offended, while we came to him in his Hou&s;e; and before &s;aid <HI>Bolles</HI> could half do this Errand to this pretended Mini&s;ter of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> he bid them go out, <HI>Bolles</HI> in&s;i&s;ted to read &s;aid Pa|per to inform what they de&s;ired, he &s;aid I will not hear it; and before <HI>Bolles</HI> could read one Word, this pretended Mi|ni&s;ter of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> pu&s;hed him with both Hands looking very angry, and &s;o pu&s;ht the re&s;t while he got them all out of his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Now let us con&s;ider how unrea&s;onable this pretended Mi|ni&s;ter of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was. They had blamed us much for com|ing on their pretended Sabbath, &s;aying we &s;hould come an|other Day to &s;peak to them, and every Time we came be|fore this to &s;peak to them between their Meetings, we were carried Pri&s;oners away from the People, except when the People were ordered to go from us and not hear us. And now when we came above ten Miles to &s;peak with him in the Middle of the Week, he would not &s;uffer it, but com|manded us out of the Hou&s;e, and pu&s;hed us with both Hands while he got us out. Surely he was not able by &s;ound Doctrine to exhort and convince the Gain-&s;ayers ac|cording to <HI>Tit.</HI> i. 9. and therefore he took another Cour&s;e. If the Scripture was of his Side to confute us, why did he turn us out of his Hou&s;e? Our Bu&s;ine&s;s was to have a Di&s;|pute with him before his own People, that it might come to Light by the Scripture who followed <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> he or we; but he would not hear it becau&s;e his Deeds were evil, as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> affirms <HI>John</HI> iii. 20, 21. <HI>Every one that doth Evil hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light le&s;t his Deeds &s;hould be reproved: but he that doth Truth cometh to the Light, that his Deeds may be made manife&s;t that they are wrought in God.</HI> We read that <HI>Paul</HI> di&s;puted daily Months and Years, <HI>Acts</HI> ix, he di&s;puted in the Synagogue and in the Market daily with them that met with him, <HI>Acts</HI> xvii: 17. Al&s;o he di&s;puted again&s;t the <HI>Grecians,</HI> but they went about to &s;lay him, <HI>Acts</HI> ij. 29. Thus it was <HI>Paul</HI>'s Man|ner to di&s;pute, and it was the Practice of Deceivers to per|&s;ecute
<PB N="4" REF="008802_0004_102FCB4241AD5628">
him, they went about to &s;lay him. <HI>Paul</HI> di&s;puted that it might be made manife&s;t that his Deeds were wrought in God; but he that doth Evil hates to di&s;pute le&s;t his evil Deeds &s;hould be reproved. Al&s;o 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 24. <HI>The Ser|vant of the Lord mu&s;t not &s;trive, but be gentle unto all Men, apt to teach, in Meekne&s;s in&s;tructing tho&s;e that oppo&s;e them|&s;elves.</HI> And 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 15. <HI>Be ready always to give an An|&s;wer to every Man that a&s;keth you a Rea&s;on of the Hope that is in you.</HI> But this pretended Mini&s;ter of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is never ready to an&s;wer us as we can find, for we have lately been three Times at his Hou&s;e, and he has commanded us out every Time, It was &s;aid of <HI>Nabal,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxv. 17, <HI>He is &s;uch a Son of Belial that a Man cannot &s;peak to him.</HI>&mdash; Paul <HI>dwelt two whole Years in his own hired Hou&s;e, and re|ceived all that came in unto him.</HI> Acts xxviii. 30. So that he turned none out of his Hou&s;e to &s;hun a Di&s;pute. And <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid <HI>Be ye Followers of me even as I am of Chri&s;t.</HI> So that Mini&s;ters of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> ought to be forward to di&s;pute as <HI>Paul</HI> was, and not turn them out of his Hou&s;e when they come to di&s;cour&s;e with him.</P>
<P>And here follows a Copy of &s;aid Paper which &s;aid <HI>Lord</HI> &s;aid he would not hear. <HI>Norwich,</HI> the 22d of the fourth Month, 1761. Con&s;idering we have &s;undry Times, within &s;ix Weeks, travelled many Miles to this Town, to &s;peak a few Words to the People, between their Meetings, of Things that God hath enlightened us, and have been pre|vented by the Authority and Mini&s;ter, twice we have been kept Pri&s;oners while dark Night, the next Time we waited in the Meeting-hou&s;e while <HI>Benjamin Lord</HI> had done &s;peak|ing, and one of us beginning to &s;peak, &s;aid <HI>Lord</HI> told the People it would prophane the Sabbath of the great God for them to &s;top and hear us, calling us Praters; and when one of us &s;aid this is not the Sabbath of God, he &s;aid you are Madmen. Therefore &s;eeing he does not allow the People to hear us &s;peak of the Things of God on his pretended Sabbath, we de&s;ired Liberty to &s;hew by the Scripture that the fir&s;t Day of the Week is not the Chri&s;tian Sabbath; and to &s;hew by the Scripture what the Chri&s;tian Re&s;t or Sabbath is; and how Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper ought to be
<PB N="5" REF="008802_0005_102FCB43D23B34B0">
admini&s;tered, and what they are Figures of. And al&s;o to &s;hew &s;ome Scripture Marks, for People to know the Fol|lowers of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by; and &s;ome Scripture Marks to know fal&s;e Teachers by. And if we &s;ay any thing contrary to Scripture, let him make it manife&s;t to the People before us.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, we &s;hall &s;hew that the fir&s;t Day of the Week is not the Chri&s;tian Sabbath, whereas Friend <HI>Lord</HI> called the fir&s;t Day of the Week the Sabbath of the great God, he is under a gro&s;s Mi&s;take, for the Scripture &s;ays, <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 15. <HI>where no Law is, there is no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI> And God has no Law in the Scripture to keep that Day for a Sabbath, there|fore it is not the Sabbath of the great God, but only the Sabbath of the God of this World, as the Scripture &s;ays, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> iv. 4. <HI>The God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them which believe not, le&s;t the Light of the glorious Go&s;|pel of Chri&s;t, who is the Image of God, &s;hould &s;hine unto them.</HI> Al&s;o the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith of this Colony, &s;ays in p. 7. <HI>Believe in all divine Wor&s;hip, it is not enough that this or that Act of Wor&s;hip is not forbidden in the Word of God, if it be not commanded and you perform it, you may fear you will be found guilty.</HI> So that Friend <HI>Lord</HI> may fear he will be found guilty for keeping his pretended Sabbath him|&s;elf, according to his own Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith. Becau&s;e it is not commanded in the Word of God, Al&s;o it is impo&s;|&s;ible it &s;hould be the Chri&s;tian Sabbath, becau&s;e it is no where called Sabbath in Scripture, but called the fir&s;t Day of the Week, in <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 7. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xvi. 2. and <HI>John</HI> xx. 1 and 19. And there is not one Word about its being a Sabbath in Scripture, therefore it is evident they knew not it was a <HI>Sabbath&punc;</HI> for if they had known it was a Sabbath, they would have called it &s;o, and not always call it the fir&s;t Day of the Week. Al&s;o <HI>Mat.</HI> xxviii. when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> left his Apo&s;tles, he charged them to teach all Nations, to ob&s;erve all Things what&s;oever he had commanded them; and they have no where in all the New Te&s;tament taught one of the Nations to ob&s;erve this pretended Sabbath: But, <HI>Rom.</HI> xiv. the Apo&s;tle commanded the Church not to judge him that e&s;teemed one Day above another, con&s;idering he regarded it to the Lord. Yet he was afraid of them that ob&s;erve
<PB N="6" REF="008802_0006_102FCB75106C6438" MS="y">
Days, lea&s;t he had be&s;towed upon them Labour in vain. <HI>Gal.</HI> iv. 10, 11. <HI>Ye ob&s;erve Days and Months, and Times and Years, and I am afraid of you, le&s;t I have be&s;towed La|bour in vain.</HI> Ob&s;erve, he was as much again&s;t ob&s;erving Days as he was again&s;t ob&s;erving Months and Years; by all which it is evident he did not ob&s;erve Days him&s;elf. Doubt|le&s;s it was Days commanded in the Old Te&s;tament that &s;ome of the Church was en&s;nared about. But the fir&s;t Day of the Week was never commanded, nor nothing &s;aid about keeping of it in all the Scripture. And the Apo&s;tle &s;pake again&s;t ob&s;erving any Day. And he al&s;o &s;ays, <HI>Gal.</HI> i. 8.9. <HI>Tho' we or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Go&s;pel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accur&s;ed. As we &s;aid before, &s;o &s;ay I now again, If any Man preach any other Go&s;pel unto you, than that ye have received, let him be accur&s;ed.</HI> Therefore how can the pre|tended Mini&s;ter of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> that preach that this pretended Sabbath ought to be kept, in &s;uch a &s;uper&s;titious manner, e&s;cape this Cur&s;e. And is not this pretended Sabbath an accur&s;ed Thing al&s;o; e&s;pecially con&s;idering the Per&s;ecution that is u&s;ed to force the Children of God to keep it, by &s;poiling their Goods, impri&s;oning and torturing their Bodies by whipping, not exceeding twenty Stripes, if they refu&s;e to pay ten Shillings for working on this pretended Sabbath. And is not this Law a Work of the Devil, to torture the Body with twenty Stripes, and to force a Per&s;on to pay ten &s;hillings or comply with this wicked Sabbath, again&s;t a Man's Con&s;cience, when he knows it is not God's Sabbath, and therefore it will be a great &s;in for him, either to keep it, or to pay ten &s;hillings. And we do e&s;teem this <HI>Benja|min Lord</HI> to be a hardened Per&s;ecutor; for while he has been a Preacher where he now is, we have been cruelly whipt for pretended Breach of Sabbath, eight at one time, near his Hou&s;e, and we under&s;tood he looked on and liked it very well; and &s;maller Numbers have been whipt &s;everal other Times; and it was all for going through <HI>Norwich</HI> to our appointed Meeting at <HI>Lebanon</HI> on the fir&s;t Day of the Week, and we endured it with the Help of God, while the Authority forbore whipping and let us pa&s;s without.
<PB N="7" REF="008802_0007_102FEEF42FBD7368">
This might have been Conviction enough to him that God was with us in our Sufferings, if he had been &s;o much as a Babe in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and he has not &s;hewed us one Word of Scripture about keeping &s;aid pretended Sabbath to this Day, and yet calls it the Sabbath of the great God. And when we go to de&s;ire him to prove it by Scripture, he commands and pu&s;hes us out of his Hou&s;e. Al&s;o he has proved him|&s;elf to be &s;uch a one as we read of in <HI>Micah</HI> iii. 5. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, concerning the Prophets that make my People err, that bite with their Teeth, and cry Peace; and he that putteth not into their Mouth, they even prepare War again&s;t him.</HI> This appears by many that have been lain in Pri&s;on, to force them to pay Money for his preaching when they did not hear him, and profe&s;&s;ed it to be again&s;t their Con|&s;ciences. If <HI>Benjamin Lord</HI> will &s;hew us one Ver&s;e in the Bible that &s;ays one Word about keeping the fir&s;t Day of the Week for a Sabbath, he &s;hall have ten Pounds law|ful Money Reward for his Trouble, paid by us or either of us,

<P>Now if &s;aid <HI>Lord</HI> does not &s;hew us one Word in the Bible about keeping his pretended Sabbath, &s;o as to recover &s;aid ten Pounds, then let all People believe that it is the Sabbath of the God of this World. He will not di&s;pute with us by Word of Mouth, therefore we do it in Print, and &s;o de&s;ire an An&s;wer, if he plea&s;e. We de&s;ire Friend <HI>Lord</HI> may not pretend him&s;elf unwilling to take ten Pounds for &s;hewing the Scripture for his pretended Sabbath, for it &s;eems to us he will earn his Money dear enough, and we will pay him hone&s;tly; if we neglect, it will be more for his Honour to ca&s;t us into Pri&s;on, than many others which have lain there when they owed him nothing, but only for vain preaching or prating. He per&s;wades People 'tis a Sabbath, but 'tis all vain prating, no better than the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> can prove any Idol they ob&s;erve. God has &s;hewed us that it is a great Idol in this Country, and all the Religion built

Idolatry and &s;uper&s;tition carnal Mini&s;ters preach to the general Court to make Laws and puni&s;h them that God &s;ends to te&s;tify again&s;t this Idol. <HI>Nathaniel Eells</HI> of <HI>Stonington,</HI> in his &s;ermon preached to the general Court, <HI>May</HI> 12, 1748, &s;ays, As <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is Lord of all, &s;o you are his Vicegerents on Earth, commi&s;&s;ioned and &s;ent to defend his Cau&s;e, and do his Work. So in this popi&s;h Darkne&s;s they got into <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Seat, and made many Laws while it is got to be &s;uch an Idol, that Friend <HI>Lord</HI> pretends it will prophane it for his People to hear us &s;peak of the Things of God be|ween Meetings, tho' they came on Purpo&s;e to hear of the Things of God. Al&s;o the Authority orders the People away; and this is contrary to &s;cripture, for Chri&s;tians to ex|erci&s;e Authority over one another in matters of Religion, <HI>Matt.</HI> xx. 25. <HI>Je&s;us called them unto him and &s;aid, ye know that the Princes of the Gentiles exerci&s;e Dominion over them, and they that are great, exerci&s;e authority upon them: but it &s;hall not be &s;o among you; but who&s;oever will be great a|mong you, let him be your Mini&s;ter; and who&s;oever will be chief among you, let him be your &s;ervant; even as the &s;on of Man came not to be admini&s;tered unto, but to mini&s;ter, and to give his Life a Ran&s;om for many.</HI> Luke xxii. 25.</P>
<P>We know that God commanded <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to keep the &s;e|venth Day for a Sign, <HI>Ex.</HI> xxxi. 13 <HI>to</HI> 18. <HI>Verily my Sab|bath ye &s;hall keep, for it is a Sign between me and you through|out your Generations, that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth &s;anctify you:</HI> ver. 16, 17. &mdash; <HI>Wherefore the Children of I&s;rael &s;hall keep the Sabbath, to ob&s;erve the Sabbath, throughout their Generations, for a perpetual Covenant; it it a Sign between me and the Children of I&s;rael for in &s;ix Days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, and on the &s;eventh Day he re&s;ted and was refre&s;hed.</HI> Thus it ap|pears it was the &s;eventh Day Sabbath, God here com|manded to be kept for a Sign; and he al&s;o &s;ays, that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth &s;anctify <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">

Years, while the Ark was preparing, and while his long &s;uffering waited for them to repent, and to have their Sins forgiven, that &s;o he might bring them to God, that their Spirits might be reconciled to him, before their Bodies were de&s;troyed by the Flood. And he further &s;ays, <HI>Wherein few, that is eight Souls, were &s;aved by Water; the like Fi|gure, whereunto even Bapti&s;m doth al&s;o now &s;ave us: not the putting away the Filth of the Fle&s;h; but the An&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience towards God, by the Re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Whereas he &s;ays, the like Figure, he aludes from the de&s;truction of the old World, and the Salvation of <HI>Noah</HI> and his Hou&s;e by Water, which was a Figure of the Chur|ches Salvation by Chri&s;t the promi&s;ed Seed to come, who was to be her Head, and the Saviour of her Body: Bapti&s;m &s;ays he, <HI>is the like Figure,</HI> &s;o that he &s;peaks of Bapti&s;m, as it is a Figure delivered to the Church, now &s;aveth us faith he: that is, it is a Figure of our Salvation by Chri&s;t: he &s;peaks by the Figure as Chri&s;t does in the like Ca&s;e, when he gave his Di&s;ciples the Bread and Wine, which were but Figures, &s;aying, <HI>This is my Body which is broken for you:</HI> And when he gave them the Cup of Wine, he &s;aid, <HI>This is my Blood of the New Te&s;tament which is &s;hed for many.</HI> Yet they were but Figures of his Body and Blood, as Bap|ti&s;m is a Figure of our Salvation by the re&s;urrection of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> not, &s;aith Peter, <HI>the putting away the Filth of the Fle&s;h,</HI> that is, the Figure only wa&s;heth the outward Man, but we have the an&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience by the re&s;ur|rection of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> which Bapti&s;m is a Figure of. But the wa&s;hing of the Filth of the Fle&s;h, is only the Work of the Figure, and the Figure is to point out how we come by this Bapti&s;m, which clean&s;eth us from our Sins; for it is not &s;ufficient for us to know that it is the Spirit that bapti&s;eth us from our Sins, but the main Thing is to know how we came by the Gift of the Spirit, and this Knowledge is to be guided by the Figure; for <HI>Peter</HI> telleth us in <HI>ver.</HI> 18. <HI>that Chri&s;t was put to Death in the Fle&s;h, that he might bring us to God.</HI> So we come to cea&s;e from Sin by his &s;uffering in the Fle&s;h for us. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> iv. 1. <HI>He al&s;o being quickened by the Spirit, and &s;o rai&s;ed from the Dead by this Re&s;urrection of

us:</HI> and thus we come to have a good Con&s;cience towards God, by the re&s;urrection of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> &s;o that our good Con&s;cience comes by our Spiritual Bapti&s;m, and our &s;pi|ritual Bapti&s;m comes by the re&s;urrection of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> When <HI>Paul</HI> had received his Sight, and was filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, the Lord &s;aid by the Mouth of <HI>Ananias, why tarrie&s;t thou, ari&s;e and be bapti&s;ed.</HI> And when the Holy Gho&s;t fell upon <HI>Cornelius</HI> and his Hou&s;e, the Lord com|manded them by the Mouth of <HI>Peter,</HI> whom he &s;ent to teach them, to be bapti&s;ed: and <HI>Peter</HI> makes a Challenge by Way of que&s;tion, &s;aying, <HI>Can any Man forbid Water, that the&s;e &s;hould not be bapti&s;ed which have received the Holy Gho&s;t as well as we.</HI> So he that the Lord &s;ent to teach them what to do, upon this very Rea&s;on, of &s;eeing them bapti&s;ed with the Holy Gho&s;t, commands them to be bap|ti&s;ed, and it is evident with Water.</P>
<P>Bapti&s;m is a Figure that thro' the Death and Re&s;urrection of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> we die to &s;in; and are rai&s;ed up together with him to Newne&s;s of Life, having a &s;en&s;e and feeling in our&s;elves of what the &s;criptures te&s;tify concerning <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> being that one &s;acrifice for &s;in by the Effects of the &s;uffering of of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> operating in us, which mortifies and kills &s;in in us, and in his Name quickens and rai&s;es us up to Newne&s;s of Life. So the outward Figure repre&s;ents, that the Death and Burial of our Body of Sin comes by the Death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for our Sins: al&s;o the Re&s;urrection of the Body, which al&s;o comes by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is held forth by this Ordinance, as appears <HI>Rom.</HI> vi. 3, 4, 6. <HI>So many of us as were bapti&s;ed into Je&s;us Chri&s;t, were bapti&s;ed into his Death, that like as Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed up from the Dead by the Glory of the Fa|ther, even &s;o we al&s;o &s;hould walk in Newne&s;s of Life; know|ing this, that our old Man is crucified with him, that the Body of Sin might be de&s;troyed, that henceforth we &s;hould not &s;erve Sin.</HI> Al&s;o <HI>Col.</HI> ii. 12. <HI>Buried with him in Bapti&s;m, wherein we are al&s;o ri&s;en with him through the Faith of the Operation of God, who hath rai&s;ed him from the Dead.</HI> As if he &s;hould &s;ay, we are ri&s;en with him to Newne&s;s of Life by witne&s;&s;ing the Operation of God in us.

if the Dead ri&s;e not at all, why are they then bapti&s;ed for the Dead.</HI> So Bapti&s;m &s;ignifies our ri&s;ing from the Dead. Thus it appears that the Figure &s;hould be admini&s;tered by a Burial in the Water, it being a Figure of our Death to Sin, by the Death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for our Sins; and al&s;o a Re|&s;urrection to Newne&s;s of Life, by the Re&s;urrection of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and a Figure al&s;o of the Death and Re&s;urrection of our Body, which comes by <HI>Chri&s;t.

Now I pray you, Brethren, that you remember in all Things and keep the Ordinances as I delivered them to you.</HI> And we read this Ordinance of Bapti&s;m was delivered to the Church by admini&s;tering where there was much Water. <HI>Mark</HI> i. 5. <HI>There went out unto him all the Land of Judea, and they of Jeru&s;alem, and were all bapti&s;ed of him in the River of Jordan, confe&s;&s;ing their Sins.</HI> Now let us con|&s;ider what Need there was for all the Country to go <HI>Jordan</HI> where there was much Water, if it would plea&s;e God to &s;prinkle a little Water in the Face, as the pretended Mini|ni&s;ters of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> do now. The Scripture &s;ays they were all bapti&s;ed of <HI>John</HI> in <HI>Jordan.</HI> Bapti&s;e is a <HI>Greek</HI> Word, in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> it is wa&s;h or dip, as by the Dictionary appears. So they were all wa&s;hed or dipped in Water, even in <HI>Jordan. Acts</HI> viii. 38. <HI>They went down both into the Water, both Philip and the Eunuch, and he bapti&s;ed him.</HI> Al&s;o <HI>John</HI> iii. 23. <HI>John al&s;o was bapti&s;ing in Enon near to Salem, be|cau&s;e there was much Water there; and Je&s;us was bapti&s;ed of John in Jordan. Mark</HI> 1.9. And &s;eeing they all took the Pains to go where there was much Water, and were bap|ti&s;ed in the Water, and our Lord him&s;elf was bapti&s;ed in <HI>Jordan,</HI> and came up out of the Water; how can we think that we follow <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> if we are a&s;hamed to take up our Cro&s;s and do as he has done; and how does it look for a pretended Mini&s;ter of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to &s;prinkle a few Drops of Water in the Face, and &s;ay it will do as well, and &s;o con|ceit him&s;elf wi&s;er than <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and the Apo&s;tles; neither is it a true Re&s;emblance or Figure of the Spiritual Bapti&s;m, nei|ther is it an In&s;titution of God, but rather a mocking of God, neither do we perceive that God owns it by giving

<P>Some Scripture Marks to know the Followers of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by, and &s;ome &s;cripture Marks to know fal&s;e Teachers by.</P>
<P>One principal Mark given by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> for all Men to know his Di&s;ciples, was by their loving one another as he had loved them. <HI>John</HI> xiii. 34, 35. <HI>A new Commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you; that ye al&s;o love one another; by this &s;hall all Men know that ye are my Di&s;ciples, if ye have Love one for another.</HI> And he calls this his new Commandment, for them to love one another as he had loved them. We may ob&s;erve, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> gave his Di&s;ciples this new Command|ment when the Hour was come that he &s;hould depart out of this World unto the Father, as appears ver. 1. <HI>When Je&s;us knew that his Hour was come, that he &s;hould depart out of this World unto the Father.</HI> And in the&s;e xiii, xiv, and xv. Chapters, he &s;everal Times charged them to love one another, and to bear Fruit al&s;o: but here fir&s;t it &s;ays, <HI>When Je&s;us knew that his Hour was come, that he &s;hould depart out of this World unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the World, he loved them unto the End.</HI> The End here &s;poken of, was the End of his being with them in the World: for his Hour was come now to depart out of this

World. And this Text te&s;tifies that he loved them unto the End; meaning the End of his being with them to the End of the World, And al&s;o informs us, how he taught them to bear the Fruit of his Love one to another, after he departed from them out of this World unto the Father, as appears ver. 3, 4, 5. <HI>Je&s;us knowing that the Father had given all Things into his Hand, and that he was come from God, and went to God, he ri&s;eth from Supper, and laid a&s;ide his Garment, and took a Towel, and girded him&s;elf; after that he poureth Water into a Ba&s;on, and began to wa&s;h the Di&s;|ciples Feet, and to wipe them with the Towel wherewith he was girded.</HI> All this was to teach them, or rather to teach us to be &s;ubject to and &s;erve one another in Meekne&s;s and Love, and e&s;pecially in all Long-&s;uffering and Doctrine, to edify one another in the Ways of God, as he had done to them; as appears ver. 12. And &s;o after he had wa&s;hed their Feet, and had taken his Garments and was &s;at again, he &s;aid unto them, <HI>Know ye what I have done to you; ye call me Ma&s;ter and Lord, and ye &s;ay well; for I am: if I then your Lord and Ma&s;ter have wa&s;hed your Feet, ye al&s;o ought to wa&s;h one another's Feet; for I have given you an Example that ye &s;hould do as I have done to you.</HI> And con&s;idering <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> at his departing, has &s;o much in the&s;e three Chapters commanded his Di&s;ciples to love one another, as he had loved them, and gave &s;uch an Example of &s;erving them in the meane&s;t &s;ervice in the World, even to wa&s;h their Feet; and afterwards told them what he did it for; therefore we ought to take this as a &s;olemn Charge for us to love one another as he has loved us, and &s;erve one another, as he meant to teach us, by wa&s;hing the Di&s;ciples Feet. And if we &s;erve and love one another, as he meant to teach us, he affirms, that all Men &s;hall know by this that we are his Di&s;|ciples.
