<P>BELOVED, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God; becau&s;e many fal&s;e Prophets are gone out into the World.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_YOU are doubtle&s;s, my Hear|ers, &s;ome of you, &s;en&s;ible, that I have publickly delive|red, and printed Di&s;cour&s;es on the Words now read unto you, about two and twenty Years ago; at a Time when a <HI>Spirit of &s;trong Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> was making it's Way apace into this Society.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;hort Account of this Matter may be &s;een in my Letter to Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> P. 6. 7.</NOTE> But <HI>the Spirit</HI> I am now to <HI>try,</HI> being of a very different Sort from that, will lead me into a Di&s;cour&s;e of quite another Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="008064_0004_102E21BB97E89718">
THE Bu&s;ine&s;s of the third <HI>Dudleian</HI> Lecture, at this Time a&s;&s;igned to me by the Rev'd Tru&s;tees, according to the Will of the hono|rable, learned and pious Founder, is <Q>to be for the detecting, and convicting and expo|&s;ing the Idolatry of the Romi&s;h Church, their Tyranny, U&s;urpations, damnable He|re&s;ies, fatal Errors, abominable Super&s;titi|ons, and other crying Wickedne&s;&s;es in their high Places; and finally to prove, that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> is that my&s;tical <HI>Babylon,</HI> that Man of Sin, that apo&s;tate Church, &s;po|ken of in the New-Te&s;tament.</Q></P>
<P>BUT when we charge the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> with any of the&s;e Enormities, or with any other Error, either in Faith or Practice; her Advocates think it a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to tell us, <Q>Alas, Gentlemen, you are gro&s;ly mi&s;ta|ken! As for the&s;e Opinions and Practices which you take to be Errors, 'tis your &s;elves only that err in thinking them to be &s;o; for the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> is &s;o highly privileged, as to be under the con&s;tant Guidance of an Infallible Spirit. You might as well there|fore imagine that Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles have erred, as that She hath, or can.</Q></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Thing therefore to be done, in our Di&s;putes with the Adheren's and Advo|cates of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, &s;eems to be this;
<PB N="7" REF="008064_0005_102E21BE7A6F0BA0">to enquire carefully, Whether their Claim to &s;uch an extraordinary Privilege, as the conti|nual Guidance of an Infallible Spirit, be well grounded, or not? For on the one Hand, if it be, all Di&s;pute with them is at an End. We have nothing to do, but to believe as their Church believes; to receive all her Dic|tates with implicit Faith, and follow them with blind Obedience.&mdash; And again, on the other Hand, if this Claim be fal&s;e and ground|le&s;s, yet till we convince them of it, they will and mu&s;t remain impenetrable, to any Arguments with which we can pre&s;s them, on other Points. You &s;ee then, that this is the fundamental Article in the Controver&s;ies between us, and them; and that Con&s;equen|ces of the la&s;t Importance depend upon it.</P>
<P>I HOPE therefore we &s;hall all with hum|ble Reverence attend the affectionate Charge of the Apo&s;tle in my Text, and <HI>not believe this Spirit,</HI> till we have <HI>tried whether it be of God.</HI> And to this, by Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I &s;hall now apply my&s;elf.&mdash;But here &s;o many Things pre|&s;ent them&s;elves to View, that I find it no ea&s;y Matter to determine which to pa&s;s in &s;ilence, &s;ince I am confined to the Limits of one &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e, which can by no means contain them all. I mu&s;t content my&s;elf therefore to &s;elect &s;uch Th&ocirc;ts only, as can be be&s;t crouded into &s;o &s;mall a Compa&s;s, without being too much ob&s;cur'd or maim'd.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="008064_0006_102E21C0170E9298">
YOU may ob&s;erve then, that our Adver&s;a|ries the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> define <HI>their Church,</HI> to which they arrogate <HI>a Spirit of Infallibility,</HI> to be <HI>that Society of Per&s;ons, who profe&s;s Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and live in Subjection to, and Communion with the Pope, or Bi&s;hop of</HI> Rome.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Infallibility</HI> they a&s;cribe to <HI>this Church</HI> is, <HI>That thro' the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Chri&s;t and his Holy Spirit, it not only does not, but cannot err in any Doctrine of Religion.</HI>&mdash;Go then &s;ay they to this Church, and receive the Doctrine which She teaches; and there you have cer|tainly and infallibly, the true and pure Doc|trine of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Yea they &s;et up the <HI>Dictates of their Church</HI> as a <HI>Rule of Faith and Manners,</HI> di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to the <HI>Holy Scriptures;</HI> ina&s;much as they affirm, that the <HI>Scriptures</HI> can neither be truly under|&s;tood, nor &s;avingly believed, without pre&s;up|po&s;ing the <HI>Infallibility</HI> of <HI>their Church</HI> in te&s;ti|fying the divine In&s;piration of them; and a&s;certaining the Sen&s;e of them; and &s;uper|adding certain nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Traditions</HI> of the &s;ame Original and Authority with them.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Infallibility</HI> they place, not in the Church <HI>Diffu&s;ive,</HI> but in the Church <HI>Repre|&s;entative.</HI> But who the <HI>Repre&s;entative</HI> of <HI>their Church</HI> endowed with this <HI>Infallibility</HI> is, whe|ther the <HI>Pope,</HI> who is the Head of it; or a
<PB N="9" REF="008064_0007_102E21C1A80DEBE8"><HI>General Council</HI> of its Bi&s;hops and Doctors; or <HI>both together;</HI> they are at no Agreement among them&s;elves. And we are not at all concerned to help them in adju&s;ting their own Differences; th&ograve; methinks it looks with but an ill A&s;pect on their pretended Infallibility, that it hath never yet been at Lei&s;ure, or in Hu|mour to decide a Controver&s;y in which it is &s;o much concerned; and on which all its U&s;efulne&s;s to the Church is &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>FOR till this Point is determined, how &s;hall the Church <HI>Diffu&s;ive,</HI> or any of its Members, know on whom to depend, or where to ap|ply for infallible Guidance, in any Matter of Faith or Practice. I think with the learned Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet,</HI> <Q>That every Side does &s;o effectually confute the other, that I believe them all as to <HI>that:</HI> And think they argue much &s;tronger when they prove where it cannot be, than when they pretend to prove where it mu&s;t be.</Q> And if the Time would allow, it would be both an agreable and edifying Amu&s;ement, to take a View of their Arguments one again&s;t another, on this Subject, wherein it &s;o much concerns them to be all of one Mind.</P>
<P>BUT the Limits to which I am confined will not &s;uffer me on this Occa&s;ion to at|tempt to prove <HI>&s;eparately,</HI> either by <HI>their Ar|guments,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="008064_0008_102E21C472A2D848">of one Party again&s;t another, or by <HI>any of my own,</HI> that neither <HI>Pope,</HI> nor <HI>Gene|ral Council,</HI> nor <HI>both together,</HI> are <HI>guided by an Infallible Spirit in delivering the Doctrines of the Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI>&mdash;It will be &s;uffi|cient to an&s;wer all the Ends I aim at, if I can prove <HI>at once,</HI> That <HI>no &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Chri&s;t and his Holy Spirit is vouch&s;afed any where in the</HI> Romi&s;h Church, <HI>as infallibly &s;ecures it from erring in any Doctrine of the Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI></P>
<P>PERHAPS the &s;horte&s;t Way of proving this would be, to &s;hew that <HI>that Church</HI> not only <HI>may,</HI> but <HI>actually hath,</HI> erred exceedingly in &s;ome Doctrines authori&s;ed by both <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Council,</HI> &s;o contrary both to Sen&s;e and Rea|&s;on, as well as Scripture; that we, who live &s;o far remov'd from the Seat of pretended In|fallibility, have more and better A&s;&s;urances that tho&s;e Doctrines mu&s;t be notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e; than we have, or po&s;&s;ibly can have, that there is, or ever was, either <HI>Pope,</HI> or <HI>General Council</HI> in the World, to enjoin us to believe them.</P>
<P>BUT this would lead me to take up mo&s;t of the Time in expo&s;ing the Ab&s;urdity of &s;ome <HI>other Doctrine</HI> of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> and to deduce the Fal&s;ehood and Arrogance of their Claim to <HI>Infallibity,</HI> only by Way of Inference from it; which tho' I believe the
<PB N="11" REF="008064_0009_102E21C8C85E70D8">&s;horte&s;t, would yet look like a more indirect Method of Proceedure; and might perhaps prevent &s;ome of my Succe&s;&s;ors in this Lecture, from attempting to expo&s;e &s;uch a fal&s;e Doct|rine, in a more effectual manner, than I am able to do.&mdash;I &s;hall therefore take another Cour&s;e, and confine my&s;elf intirely to the &s;ingle Point before me, by endeavouring to &s;hew,</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> THAT it is evident, both from the Na|ture of the Thing, and from the Account which they them&s;elves give of the Infallibility they pre|tend to, that we can have no good Rea&s;on to believe &s;uch Infallibility lodged any where in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, without &s;ome divine Promi&s;e to found our Belief of it upon. <HI>And,</HI></P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> THAT none of the Promi&s;es alledged for this Purpo&s;e, intend or prove any &s;uch Thing.</P>
<P>Now if I can make it appear, that none of the Promi&s;es alledged intimate any &s;uch Thing, as the Conduct of an infallible Spirit in deli|vering the Doctrines of Religion, to be be&s;tow|ed any where in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church; and if I can prove, that we can have no good Rea&s;on to believe any &s;uch Conduct vouch&s;afed to the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, without a divine Promi&s;e of it; 'twill thence plainly follow, that we ought not to believe the <HI>Romi&s;h Spirit of In|fallibility;</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="008064_0010_102E21CA55CB8B48">but &s;hould reckon the Pretenders to it, among the <HI>fal&s;e Prophets,</HI> of whom we are warned in my Text.</P>
<P>Here then,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I. I AM to prove,</HI> That it is evident both from the Nature of the Thing, and from the Ac|count which they them&s;elves give, of the Infallibi|lity they pretend to, that we can have no good Rea|&s;on to believe &s;uch Infallibility lodged any where in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, without &s;ome divine Pro|mi&s;e to found our Belief of it upon.</P>
<P N="1">1^&s;^t. <HI>THIS is evident from the Nature of the Thing it&s;elf.</HI>&mdash;For it cannot be pre|tended, that God is under any Nece&s;&s;ity of Nature, or Obligation in Point of Ju&s;tice, unle&s;s he hath laid him&s;elf under one by Pro|mi&s;e, to be&s;tow the infallible Conduct of his Holy Spirit in delivering the Doctrines of Religion, upon any Per&s;on or Community whatever: And much le&s;s can it be preten|ded, that he is under any Nece&s;&s;ity or Obli|gation to be&s;tow it upon one particular Per|&s;on or Church, rather than another. And therefore, if God does vouch&s;afe the infalli|ble Guidance of his Holy Spirit in delivering the Doctrines of Religion to <HI>any Church;</HI> and more e&s;pecially if he does it to <HI>one Church</HI> ex|clu&s;ive of <HI>all others,</HI> it mu&s;t be allowed by all to be an Act entirely <HI>free</HI> and <HI>arbitrary.</HI> And
<PB N="13" REF="008064_0011_102E21CCCAA8F548">if &s;o, then it can never be known <HI>what Church</HI> God &s;o highly favours, or whether he do &s;o by <HI>any;</HI> unle&s;s we know that he hath made &s;ome antecedent Promi&s;e that he will: Or un|le&s;s he bares Witne&s;s to the Preten&s;ions of his favourite Church, with &s;uch miraculous Pow|ers, and apparent Gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, as it would be incon&s;i&s;tent for the God of Truth to confirm a Lie with.&mdash;But now the <HI>Roma|ni&s;ts,</HI> I think, don't pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that their Church is endowed with any miraculous Pow|ers or Gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, to confirm its Preten&s;ions to <HI>Infallibility.</HI> For th&ocirc; they &s;tudy to per&s;wade the World, that Miracles are &s;till among them; yet they do not &s;o much as &s;ay, that the Miracles are wrought by tho&s;e, with whom this Infallibility is lodged; or that they are done to prove them to be Infallible. And therefore, Since the Gift of Infallibility is an arbitrary Thing, and they don't pretend to prove they have it by Miracles; if they can ever prove that their Church hath it, they can do it only by pro|ducing &s;ome Promi&s;e of God to be&s;tow it on them. But what wretched Contradiction, Confu&s;ion, and Circulation will this unavoi|dably run them into? For according to their Principles, we can neither be a&s;&s;ured that the Scriptures are the Word of God, nor be cer|tain what is the Meaning of the Promi&s;es of them; unle&s;s we fir&s;t believe the Infallibility
<PB N="14" REF="008064_0012_102E21D132A40510">of their Church in te&s;tifying the divine Au|thority of the Scriptures, and a&s;certaining the Sen&s;e of them. And yet when we enquire, how we &s;hall be a&s;&s;ured of the pretended In|fallibility of their Church, it is evident from the Nature of the Thing it&s;elf, compared with their own Principles and Conce&s;&s;ions, that they can never prove it, unle&s;s they can find &s;ome Promi&s;e of it in the Scriptures.&mdash;So that we mu&s;t believe their Church to be In|fallible, before we can either believe, or know the Meaning of the Scriptures; and yet we mu&s;t believe their Church Infallible, becau&s;e they pretend that the Scriptures &s;ay it is. But this is only to run round in a Circle, and favours &s;o little of a Spirit of Infallibility, that we hardly need enquire, whether the Scriptures have promi&s;ed them Infallibility, or no. <Q>For it is an eternal Principle and Rule of Rea&s;on (as hath been frequently ob&s;erved upon this Occa&s;ion) never to prove one Thing by another, till that other is fir&s;t well proved, if it be not a &s;elf-evi|dent Truth: Nor can any Thing be proved afterwards by that, which was fir&s;t proved by it. This is as impo&s;&s;ible, as if a Father &s;hould beget a Son, and &s;hould be after wards begotten by that Son.</Q> Therefore the Scriptures cannot prove the Infallibility of the Church, &s;ince their Authority (accor|ding to <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Principles) mu&s;t fir&s;t be pro|ved
<PB N="15" REF="008064_0013_102E21D2C5C14828">by the Churches Te&s;timony.&mdash;Thus much for the Nature of the Thing it &s;elf. I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT is likewi&s;e evident from the Account which the</HI> Romani&s;ts <HI>them&s;elves give of the In|fallibility which they a&s;cribe to their Church, that we can have no good Rea&s;on to believe any &s;uch In|fallibility confer'd upon it, without &s;ome Divine Promi&s;e to found our Belief of it upon.</HI>&mdash;The Account they give of the Matter is, that it is by <HI>the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Chri&s;t and his Holy Spirit, that their Church cannot err in any Doctrine of Religion.</HI> From whence it is plain, that in order to believing their Churches Infallibility, we mu&s;t believe, that the Per&s;on or Per&s;ons who con&s;titute their <HI>Church-Repre&s;entative,</HI> (as they call it) whether <HI>Pope,</HI> or <HI>Council,</HI> or <HI>both together</HI> we cannot tell; nor hath their Infallibility ever yet been &s;o kind as to inform us in a Point &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to our Salvation; that this Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, I &s;ay, are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Chri&s;t and his Holy Spirit. But this will both run them again into a Circle; and al&s;o prove the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome Promi&s;es to found &s;uch a Belief upon.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT will run them again into a circular Argumentation.</HI>&mdash;For how &s;hall we be per|&s;waded that their Church hath the A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the Infallible A&s;&s;i&s;tance, of Chri&s;t and the Ho|ly
<PB N="16" REF="008064_0014_102E21D5772D7530">Gho&s;t. We &s;hould never have known that there were &s;uch Divine Per&s;ons as Chri&s;t and the Holy Gho&s;t, if the Scriptures had not revealed them to us. They tell us, we can neither &s;avingly believe, nor under&s;tand the Scriptures, without the Infallible Te&s;timony and Interpretation of their Church: That is in effect, we cannot believe that there are &s;uch Per&s;ons as Chri&s;t and the Holy Gho&s;t, unle&s;s we fir&s;t believe their Church to be In|fallible; and yet we cannot believe their Church to be Infallible, unle&s;s we believe that there are &s;uch Per&s;ons as Chri&s;t and the Ho|ly Gho&s;t; for its Infallibility, by their own Confe&s;&s;ion, doth &s;uppo&s;e the peculiar A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of both the&s;e. And none can believe their A&s;&s;i&s;tance before he believes they are. But leaving them in the mid&s;t of this Circle, I proceed to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THAT in order to our believing that Church favoured with the Infallible A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Chri&s;t and the Holy Spirit, we mu&s;t of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity have &s;ome Promi&s;e to it of &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to found our Faith upon.</HI>&mdash;<Q>For how comes this Church to have this Infallible A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance? We can well enough &s;uppo&s;e, that Chri&s;t and the Holy Spirit may exi&s;t with|out giving this A&s;&s;i&s;tance. And we can &s;uppo&s;e, that the Chri&s;tian Religion may very well continue in the World, after that
<PB N="17" REF="008064_0015_102E21D8D85A5060">all the Doctrines and Precepts of it have been committed to Writing by Men under the Conduct of an Infallible Spirit, without the Continuance of &s;uch an Infallibility in the Church. This A&s;&s;i&s;tance therefore is not a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> but a <HI>free Act.</HI> And if a <HI>free Act,</HI> then for ought that they know, their Church may not be &s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted. For whence can they be &s;ure of an <HI>arbitrary</HI> Thing, unle&s;s the <HI>Authors</HI> of this A&s;&s;i&s;tance have engaged them&s;elves by <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> to give their Church, that Infallible A&s;&s;i&s;tance? So that is impo&s;&s;ible for them to prove &s;uch an Infallible A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Chri&s;t and the Holy Gho&s;t, unle&s;s they produce &s;ome expre&s;s Promi&s;e for it.&mdash;And &s;hould they produce any &s;uch Promi&s;es, they will &s;till be liable to be que&s;tioned, how they are &s;ure that the&s;e are <HI>Divine</HI> Promi&s;es? When the Knowlege that they are <HI>Divine,</HI> mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the Thing to be <HI>true,</HI> which they would prove out of them; <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>their Church is Infal|lible?</HI> And &s;uppo&s;ing the Promi&s;es <HI>Divine,</HI> how are they &s;ure, that <HI>this</HI> and no <HI>other</HI> is the Meaning of them? When from &s;uch Places they prove, that <HI>their Church</HI> is the only <HI>Infallible Interpreter</HI> of Scripture.</Q>&mdash; But waving any further Advantage which might be made of their lo&s;ing them&s;elves perpetually in &s;uch inextricable Labyrinths, I &s;hall proceed to &s;hew,</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="008064_0016_102E21DC14F05618">
II. <HI>THAT none of the Promi&s;es ordinarily alledged to prove the Infallibility of the</HI> Romi&s;h <HI>Church, can po&s;&s;ibly mean any &s;uch Thing.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e Promi&s;es are of two Sorts, namely, &s;uch as are pleaded by them, who imagine the Spirit of Infallibility to re&s;ide in the <HI>Pope alone;</HI> or &s;uch as are urged by them, who place it in a <HI>Ge|neral Council,</HI> or in <HI>Pope and Council.</HI>&mdash;I &s;hall con&s;ider the Allegations of both Sorts di&s;tinctly, but as briefly as I can.</P>
<P><Q>THEY who place Infallibility in the <HI>Pope alone,</HI> think it is well proved in general, that there mu&s;t be an Infallibility in the Church; and from hence they conclude, that it mu&s;t be in the <HI>Pope.</HI> For if there mu&s;t be a liv|ing &s;peaking Judge, always ready to guide the Church, and to decide Controver&s;ies, they &s;ay this cannot be in the <HI>diffu&s;ive</HI> Body of Chri&s;tians, for the&s;e cannot meet to judge; nor can it be in a <HI>General Council,</HI> the meet|ing of which depends upon &s;o many Acci|dents, and on the Con&s;ent of &s;o many Prin|ces, that the Infallibility mu&s;t lie dormant frequently for whole Ages together, if the <HI>General Council,</HI> or <HI>Pope and Council</HI> is the Seat of it. And therefore, taking it for gran|ted that it is certainly in the <HI>Church,</HI> they conclude it can be no where el&s;e but in the <HI>Pope</HI>

(1.) THE Seventy were &s;ent abroad by Chri&s;t when there were yet no infallible Wri|tings containing his Doctrine, made by Him|&s;elf, or his Apo&s;tles, or other in&s;pired Per&s;ons. &mdash;And &s;o <HI>the Seventy</HI> had more need of the immediate Guidance of the Spirit of God <HI>then,</HI> than the <HI>Church</HI> can have <HI>now;</HI> &s;ince that the Doctrine of Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath been publi&s;hed to the World by the Writings of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> in the New-Te&s;tament, &s;o ful|ly and clearly, <HI>that the Man of God may be per|fect, thoroughly furni&s;hed unto all good Works by them.</HI>

<P N="2">(2.)

When therefore our Adver&s;aries can produce the like Credentials, for their Doc|tors and Pa&s;tors, either apart, or in a Ge|neral Council, they may then perhaps from hence argue &s;omething in Favour of their Infallibility, but not before.</Q></P>
<P>AGAIN it is pleaded, that Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>Tell the Church; and if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen Man, and a Publican.</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Math. 18.17.</NOTE> &mdash; But what is it, which is here
<PB N="24" REF="008064_0022_102E21EA0BA049B0">to be told to the Church? Not a Doubt about any Point of Doctrine, but a Complaint of Tre&s;pa&s;s of one Brother again&s;t another. So that if Infallibility is promi&s;ed in the&s;e Words, 'tis Infallibility, not in determining the Doc|trines of Religion, but in judging Matters of Tre&s;pa&s;s. &mdash; Again, What Church is to be ap|plied to? Not the Church Catholick, conven'd in General Council, but the private Chri&s;tian A&s;&s;embly, to which the aggrieved Brother belongs. He was fir&s;t to u&s;e his own private Endeavours; then the Interpo&s;ition of Friends was to be tried; and if that was without Suc|ce&s;s, the Matter was to be referred to the A&s;|&s;embly, to which they belonged. So that if infallible Guidance in Judgment can be ga|thered from this Pa&s;&s;age, it may be claimed by every private Chri&s;tian A&s;&s;embly; and &s;urely then there can be no need of travelling to a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> General Council to obtain it.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Place alledged is that Promi&s;e of our Saviour,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Math. 28.20.</NOTE> <HI>I am with you always, even to the End of the World.</HI>&mdash;This implies Chri&s;t's &s;piri|tual Pre&s;ence with his Mini&s;ters. And this Promi&s;e of Chri&s;t's &s;piritual Pre&s;ence, was to the Succe&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles, as well as to them&s;elves; for it reaches to the End of the World. But then, this Promi&s;e intends only <HI>continual</HI> A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and not <HI>infallible.</HI> For whatever is here promi&s;ed to the Apo&s;tles, is
<PB N="25" REF="008064_0023_102DCB822296B0C8">promi&s;ed to each of them <HI>&s;ingly,</HI> and therefore cannot with any good Rea&s;on be re&s;trained to their Succe&s;&s;ors taken <HI>collectively.</HI> Whereas our Adver&s;aries them&s;elves do not pretend, that each of the Succe&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles <HI>&s;ingly,</HI> is render'd Infallible, by virtue of this Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>BESIDES (as hath already been ob&s;erved) there is not the &s;ame Rea&s;on, that the Pa&s;tors of the Church collectively &s;hould be infallible <HI>now,</HI> which there was for the Apo&s;tles being &s;o <HI>then.</HI> Nor can they produce the &s;ame Evi|dences for their being &s;o, which the Apo&s;tles did. Nor can any good Rea&s;on be drawn from this Promi&s;e, for Infallibility to the Suc|ce&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, and not <HI>el&s;ewhere.</HI>&mdash;So that this Text al&s;o may be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, as of no U&s;e to our Adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>NOR is <HI>Joh.</HI> 16.13. alledged to any better Purpo&s;e.&mdash;For <HI>Guidance into all Truth by the Spirit</HI> is there promi&s;ed to none, but &s;uch as have it promi&s;ed to them al&s;o, that the <HI>Spirit will &s;hew them Things to come.</HI> And therefore, that Promi&s;e mu&s;t be re&s;trained to the Apo&s;tles, and not extended to their Succe&s;&s;ors. For I think the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> do not pretend their Church is endowed with a <HI>Spirit of Prophecy,</HI> as well as of <HI>Infallibility.</HI></P>
<P>NOR la&s;tly, will it prove their Preten&s;ions, if <HI>the Church of the living God</HI> is called the <HI>Pil|lar
<PB N="26" REF="008064_0024_102E21EE01CB84B8">and Ground of Truth, 1 Tim.</HI> 3.15.&mdash;For that is only becau&s;e it is <HI>built upon the Founda|tion of the Apo&s;tles and Prophets;</HI> which the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church can &s;carce be allowed to be, &s;ince it lays it's own <HI>Infallibility</HI> in the <HI>Foundation,</HI> and builds both <HI>Credit</HI> and <HI>Meaning</HI> of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and <HI>Prophets</HI> upon <HI>that.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER it ought to be ob&s;erved, that if it was <HI>a Church</HI> which is here called <HI>the Pil|lar and Ground of Truth,</HI> it was not the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> but the Church in which <HI>Timothy</HI> was directed how to behave him&s;elf, namely the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us.</HI> And that this Church hath erred fundamentally mu&s;t needs be grant|ed, &s;ince, as Hi&s;torians tell us, there is not one Family of Chri&s;tians now to be found in <HI>Ephe|&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>BUT after all, I think with an eminent Cri|tick
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. SHARP.</NOTE>, that it is <HI>Timothy him&s;elf,</HI> and not the <HI>Church of Ephe&s;us,</HI> which is here called <HI>a Pillar and Support of the Truth:</HI> that the Pa&s;&s;age &s;hould be rendered, <HI>that thou may&s;t know how to behave thy &s;elf in the Hou&s;e of God, which is the Church of the living God,</HI> as a <HI>Pillar and Support of the Truth.</HI> <Q>The Apo&s;tle is giving Rules to <HI>Timothy,</HI> how to behave him&s;elf in the Church, which He calls <HI>the Hou&s;e of God.</HI> Now after he had called it <HI>an Hou&s;e,</HI> one would think it not proper, that in the &s;ame Breath, he &s;hould call it a <HI>Pillar</HI> of an Hou&s;e.
<PB N="27" REF="008064_0025_102E21F063004808">But it is very natural to give that Name to <HI>Timothy,</HI> and to exhort him to behave him|&s;elf as &s;uch in the Hou&s;e of God.</Q> And if you take it in this Sen&s;e, it is as far off from the Purpo&s;e they alledge it for, as that of their <HI>angelick Doctor</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aquinas.</HI></NOTE>; who proved that all Men are not equally bound to have an explicit Faith, becau&s;e it is written, that <HI>the Oxen were plowing, and the A&s;&s;es feeding be&s;ide them</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job. 1.14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE are the principal Texts alledged by tho&s;e who place the Infallibility in a <HI>General Council</HI> of &s;uch as live in Subjection to, and Communion with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome.</HI> And concerning them all I think it will hold true, that any other Chri&s;tian Church may put in as fair a Claim to what they Promi&s;e, as the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> So that we mu&s;t either believe, that <HI>all</HI> Churches are Infallible, or de|ny that the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church is &s;o. For where all have an equal Claim with her, it is very plain that the Claim of all mu&s;t be ju&s;t, or el&s;e that her Claim cannot be &s;o. &mdash; Now that all Chri&s;tian Churches are not Infallible, we need no other Proof, but their Contradictions one to another. And therefore we need not be at a Lo&s;s what to think of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, unle&s;s &s;ome Promi&s;e of Infallibility could be produced which re&s;pected her, more than others.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="008064_0026_102E21F1F4DEA330">
AND now the Sum of all is, That <HI>that Spi|rit</HI> which cannot &s;tand the Te&s;t, ought not to be <HI>believed:</HI> that the Spirit of Infallibility contended for by the <HI>Romani&s;ts,</HI> can never be proved without &s;ome expre&s;s Scripture Pro|mi&s;e of it to them: that for them to betake them&s;elves to Scripture Proof upon this Occa|&s;ion, is to involve them&s;elves in &s;uch Circula|tions and Contradictions, as would better be|come any Thing el&s;e, than Infallibility: that if waving the Advantages this would give us, we attend to the Promi&s;es alledged, we find none of them can, without manife&s;t Vio|lence, be interpreted of a <HI>&s;tanding, perpetual</HI> Infallibility in the Church: And la&s;tly, that if, contrary to the Truth, we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e this to be the obvious Intention of them all; yet not one of them hath more re&s;pect to the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, than to any other.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e Things laid together, it will be no difficult or unfair Conclu&s;ion, that the Infallibility which the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> arrogate to their Church is not from the <HI>Spirit of Truth,</HI> but from a <HI>Spirit of Error.</HI></P>
<P>AND now (to borrow the Words of the ce|lebrated Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exp. P. 152.</NOTE>) <Q>the Importance of this Argument, rather than the Difficulty of it, hath made it nece&s;&s;ary to dwell &s;o long upon it. For it is indeed, the main funda|mental
<PB N="29" REF="008064_0027_102E21F46248AC20">Point in Debate between <HI>us</HI> and the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and upon which, in a manner all the other Points of Difference do depend. Since then &s;o much depends upon it, and &s;ince the Mi&s;&s;ionaries of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> are generally very well in&s;tructed in it, there|fore it ought to be thor&ocirc;ly con&s;idered. For how little Strength &s;oever there may be in the Arguments brought to prove this Infalli|bility, yet they put &s;pecious Colours upon them, and they are commonly managed, both with much Art, and with great Confidence.</Q> But the only infallible Rule in this, as in all other Points of Importance, is, <HI>To the Law, and to the Te&s;timony: If they &s;peak not according to this Word, it is becau&s;e there is no Light in them.</HI>

What need then can there be of an infallible Interpreter, to
<PB N="30" REF="008064_0028_102E21F5F8E6ECD0">explain the Meaning of what a Child may know without &s;uch Help?

<P>I MUST therefore leave this, together with the &s;everal intere&s;ting and important Points expre&s;&s;ed in the Statute of the worthy Found|er of the&s;e Lectures, which I read unto you at the Beginning of this Di&s;cour&s;e, to &s;uch as by the Will of God may &s;ucceed me.&mdash;I mu&s;t al&s;o wave the Reflections which offer them|&s;elves upon what hath been &s;poken at this Time: And &s;hall conclude in one Word of Advice, to &s;uch of you, my Hearers, as intend the Study of Divinity; namely,</P>

And it's Here&s;ies, Super&s;titions, Cruelties, Idolatries, and other crying Wickedne&s;&s;es are &s;uch, that you will find it no very ea&s;y Matter to per&s;wade your &s;elves, that there can be any Salvation in it. This is doubtle&s;s therefore, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and important Controver&s;y among Chri&s;tians; and &s;o de&s;erves your Attention in the fir&s;t Place.
