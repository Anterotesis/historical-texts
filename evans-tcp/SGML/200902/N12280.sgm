<HEAD>The <HI>American</HI> CRISIS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN the progre&s;s of politics, as in the common occurrences of life, we are not only apt to forget the ground we have travelled over, but frequently neglect to gather up experience as we go. We expend, if I may &s;o &s;ay, the knowledge of every day on the circum&s;tances that produce it, and journey on in &s;earch of new matter and new refine|ments: But as it is plea&s;ant, and &s;ometimes u&s;eful, to look back, even to the fir&s;t periods of infancy, and trace the turns and windings through which we have pa&s;&s;ed, &s;o we may likewi&s;e derive many advantages by halting a while in our political career, and taking a review of the wondrous com|plicated labyrinth of little more than ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>TRULY, may we &s;ay, that never did man grow old in &s;o &s;hort a time! We have crouded the bu&s;ine&s;s of an age into the compa&s;s of a few months, and have been driven through &s;uch a rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of things, that, for the want of lei&s;ure to think, we unavoidably wa&s;ted knowledge as we came, and have left nearly as much behind us as we brought with us: But the road is yet rich with the fragments, and, be|fore we fully lo&s;e &s;ight of them, will repay us for the trouble of &s;topping to pick them up.</P>
<P>WERE a man to be totally deprived of memory, he would be incapable of forming any ju&s;t opinion; every thing about him would &s;eem a chaos; he would have even his own hi&s;tory to a&s;k from every one; and by not knowing how the world went on in his ab&s;ence, he would be at a lo&s;s to know how it <HI>ought</HI> to go on when he recovered, or rather, returned to it again. In like manner, tho' in a le&s;s degree, a too great inat|tention to pa&s;t occurrences retards and bewilders our judgment in every thing; while, on the contrary, by comparing what is pa&s;t with what is pre&s;ent, we frequently hit on the true cha|racter of both, and become wi&s;e with very little trouble. It
<PB N="28" REF="015494_0004_0F998663A07B1810">
is a kind of countermarch, by which we get into the rear of Time, and mark the movements and meaning of things as we make our return. There are certain circum&s;tances, which, at the time of their happening, are kind of riddles, and as every riddle is to be followed by its an&s;wer, &s;o tho&s;e kind of circum&s;tances will be followed by their events, and tho&s;e events are always the true &s;olution. A con&s;iderable &s;pace of time may lap&s;e between, and unle&s;s we continue our ob&s;er|vations from the one to the other, the harmony of them will pa&s;s away unnoticed: But the misfortune is, that partly from the pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome in&s;tant things, and partly from the impatience of our own tempers, we are frequently in &s;uch a hurry to make out the meaning of every thing as fa&s;t as it happens, that we thereby never truly under&s;tand it; and not only &s;tart new difficulties to our&s;elves by &s;o doing, but, as it were, embarra&s;s Providence in her good de&s;igns.</P>
<P>I have been civil in &s;tating this fault on a large &s;cale, for, as it now &s;tands, it does not appear to be levelled again&s;t any particular &s;et of men; but were it to be refined a little farther, it might afterwards be applied to the Tories with a degree of &s;triking propriety: Tho&s;e men have been remarkable for drawing &s;udden conclu&s;ions from &s;ingle facts. The lea&s;t apparent mi&s;hap on our &s;ide, or the lea&s;t &s;eeming advantage on the part of the enemy, have determined with them the fate of a whole campaign. By this ha&s;ty judgment they have converted a retreat into a defeat; mi&s;took general|&s;hip for error; while every little advantage purpo&s;ely given the enemy, either to weaken their &s;trength by dividing it, embarra&s;s their councils by multiplying their objects, or to &s;ecure a greater po&s;t by the &s;urrender of a le&s;s, has been in|&s;tantly magnified into a conque&s;t. Thus, by quartering ill policy upon ill principles, they have frequently promoted the cau&s;e they de&s;igned to injure, and injured that which they intended to promote.</P>
<P>IT is probable the campaign may open before this Num|ber comes from the pre&s;s. The enemy have long lain idle and amu&s;ed them&s;elves with carrying on the war by procla|mations only. While they continue their delay our &s;trength encrea&s;es, and were they to move to action now, it is a cir|cum&s;tantial proof they have no reinforcement coming; wherefore, in either ca&s;e, the comparative advantage will be
<PB N="29" REF="015494_0005_0F998665F2D296F0">
ours. Like a wounded di&s;abled whale they want only time and room to die in; and though in the agony of their exit, it may be un&s;afe to live within the flapping of their tail, yet every hour &s;hortens their date and le&s;&s;ens their power of mi&s;chief. If any thing happens while this Number is in the pre&s;s, it will afford me a &s;ubject for the la&s;t pages of it. At pre&s;ent I am tired of waiting; and as neither the enemy, nor the &s;tate of politics, have <HI>yet</HI> produced any thing new, I am thereby left in the field of general matter undirected by any &s;triking or particular object. This Cri&s;is, therefore, will be made up rather of variety than novelty, and con&s;i&s;t more of things u&s;eful than things wonderful.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s of the cau&s;e, the union of the people, and the means of &s;upporting and &s;ecuring both, are points which cannot be too much attended to. He who doubts of the former is a de&s;ponding coward, and he who wilfully di&s;turbs the latter is a traitor. Their characters are ea&s;ily fixt, and under the&s;e &s;hort de&s;criptions I leave them for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>ONE of the greate&s;t degrees of &s;entimental union which America ever knew, was in denying the right of the Briti&s;h parliament <HI>"to bind the Colonies in all ca&s;es whatever."</HI> The declaration is in its form an almighty one, and is the loftie&s;t &s;tretch of arbitrary power that ever one &s;et of men, or one country claimed over another. Taxation was nothing more than the putting the declared right into practice; and this failing, recour&s;e was had to arms, as a means to e&s;tabli&s;h both the right <HI>and</HI> the practice, or to an&s;wer a wor&s;e pur|po&s;e, which will be mentioned in the cour&s;e of this Num|ber. And in order to repay them&s;elves the expence of an army, and to profit by their own inju&s;tice, the Colonies were, by another law, declared to be in a &s;tate of actual rebellion, and of con&s;equence all property therein would fall to the conquerors.</P>
<P>THE Colonies, on their part, FIRST, denied the right; SECONDLY, they &s;u&s;pended the u&s;e of taxable articles, and petitioned again&s;t the practice of taxation: and the&s;e failing, they, THIRDLY, defended their property by force, as &s;oon as it was forcibly invaded, and in an&s;wer to the declaration of rebellion and non-protection <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">bli&s;hed their declaration of Independence and right to &s;elf-protection.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="015494_0006_0F998666E22A79A8">THESE, in a few words, are the different &s;tages of the quarrel; and the parts are &s;o intimately and nece&s;&s;arily con|nected with each other as to admit of no &s;eparation. A per|&s;on, to u&s;e a trite phra&s;e, mu&s;t be a Whig or a Tory in the lump. His feelings, as a man, may be wounded; his cha|rity, as a Chri&s;tian, may be moved; but his political prin|ciples mu&s;t go through all the ca&s;es on one &s;ide or the other. He cannot be a Whig in <HI>this</HI> &s;tage, and a Tory in <HI>that.</HI> If he &s;ays he is again&s;t the United Independence of the Continent, he is to all intents and purpo&s;es again&s;t her in all the re&s;t; becau&s;e THIS LAST comprehends the whole. And he may ju&s;t as well &s;ay, that Britain was right in de|claring us rebels; right in taxing us; and right in declare|ing her <HI>"right to bind the Colonies in all ca&s;es what&s;oever."</HI> It &s;ignifies nothing what neutral ground, of his own create|ing, he may &s;kulk upon for &s;helter, for the quarrel in no &s;tage of it hath afforded any &s;uch ground; and either we or Britain are ab&s;olutely right or ab&s;olutely wrong through the whole.</P>
<P>BRITAIN, like a game&s;ter nearly ruined, hath now put all her lo&s;&s;es into one bet, and is playing a de&s;perate game for the total. If &s;he win it, &s;he wins from <HI>me</HI> my life; &s;he wins the Continent as the forfeited property of rebels; the right of taxing tho&s;e that are left as reduced &s;ubjects; and the power of binding them as &s;laves: And the &s;ingle die which determines this unparalleled event is, Whether we &s;upport our Independence or &s;he overturn it. This is coming to the point at once. Here is the touch-&s;tone to try men by. <HI>He that is not a &s;upporter of the Independent States of America, in the &s;ame degree that his religious and political prin|ciples would &s;uffer him to &s;upport the government of any other country, of which he called him&s;elf a &s;ubject, is, in the American &s;en&s;e of the word,</HI> A TORY; <HI>and the in&s;tant that he endeavours to bring his Toryi&s;m into practice, he becomes</HI> A TRAITOR. The fir&s;t can only be detected by a general te&s;t, and the law hath already provided for the latter.</P>
<P>IT is unnatural and impolitic to admit men who would root up our Independence to have any &s;hare in our legi&s;la|tion, either as electors or repre&s;entatives; becau&s;e the &s;up|port of our Independence re&s;ts in a great mea&s;ure on the
<PB REF="015494_0007_0F99866765EE3C50">
vigour and purity of our public bodies. Would Britain, even in time of peace, much le&s;s in war, &s;uffer an election to be carried by men who profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves not to be her &s;ubjects, or allow &s;uch to &s;it in parliament? Certainly not.</P>
<P>BUT there are a certain &s;pecies of Tories with whom con&s;cience or principle hath nothing to do, and who are &s;o from avarice only. Some of the fir&s;t fortunes in the Con|tinent, on the part of the Whigs, are &s;taked on the i&s;&s;ue of our pre&s;ent mea&s;ures. And &s;hall di&s;affection only be re|warded with &s;ecurity? Can any thing be a greater induce|ment to a mi&s;erly man, than the hope of making his mam|mon &s;afe? And though the &s;cheme be fraught with every character of folly, yet, &s;o long as he &s;uppo&s;es, that by doing nothing materially criminal again&s;t America on one part, and by expre&s;&s;ing his private di&s;approbation again&s;t Inde|pendence, as a palliative with the enemy on the other part, he &s;tands thereby in a &s;afe line between both, while, I &s;ay, this ground be &s;uffered to remain, craft and the &s;pirit of avarice will point it out, and men will not be wanting to fill up this mo&s;t contemptible of all characters.</P>
<P>THESE men, a&s;hamed to own the fordid cau&s;e from whence their di&s;affection &s;prings, add thereby meanne&s;s to meanne&s;s, by endeavouring to &s;helter them&s;elves under the ma&s;k of hypocri&s;y; that is, they had rather be thought to be Tories from <HI>&s;ome kind of principle,</HI> than Tories by having <HI>no principle at all.</HI> But till &s;uch time as they can &s;how &s;ome real rea&s;on, natural, political or con&s;cientious, on which their odjections to Independence are founded, we are not obliged to give them credit for being Tories of the fir&s;t &s;tamp, but mu&s;t &s;et them down as Tories of the la&s;t.</P>
<P>IN the Second Number of the Cri&s;is I endeavoured to &s;how the impo&s;&s;ibility of the enemy making any conque&s;t of Ame|rica; that nothing was wanting on our part but patience and per&s;everance, and that, with the&s;e virtues, our &s;ucce&s;s, as far as human &s;peculation could di&s;cern, &s;eemed as certain as fate. But as there are many among us, who, influenced by others, have regularly gone back from the principles they once held, in proportion as we have gone forward; and as it is the unfortunate lot of many a good man to live within
<PB N="32" REF="015494_0008_0F99866829577348">
the neighbourhood of di&s;affected ones; I &s;hall therefore, for the &s;ake of confirming the one and recovering the other, en|deavour, in the &s;pace of a page or two, to go over &s;ome of the leading principles in &s;upport of Independence. It is a much plea&s;anter ta&s;k to prevent vice than to puni&s;h it; and however our tempers may be gratified by re&s;entment, or our national expences ea&s;ed by forfeited e&s;tates, harmony and friend&s;hip is neverthele&s;s the happie&s;t condition a country can be ble&s;t with.</P>
<P>THE principal arguments in &s;upport of Independence may be comprehended under the four following heads,
<LIST>
<ITEM>FIRST,&mdash;The natural right of the Continent to In|dependence.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECONDLY,&mdash;Her intere&s;t in being independent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>THIRDLY,&mdash;The nece&s;&s;ity.&mdash;And</ITEM>
<ITEM>FOURTHLY,&mdash;The moral advantages ari&s;ing there|from.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. THE NATURAL RIGHT of the Continent to Inde|pendence, is a point which never yet was called in que&s;tion. It will not even admit of a debate. To deny &s;uch a right, would be a kind of athei&s;m again&s;t nature: And the be&s;t an&s;wer to &s;uch an objection would be, <HI>"The fool hath &s;aid in his heart, There is no God."</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. THE INTEREST of the Continent in being inde|pendent is a point as clearly right as the former. America, by her own internal indu&s;try, and unknown to all the powers of Europe, was at the beginning of the di&s;pute, arrived at a pitch of greatne&s;s, trade and population, beyond which it was the intere&s;t of Britain not to &s;uffer her to pa&s;s, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould grow too powerful to be kept &s;ubordinate. She began to view this country with the &s;ame unea&s;y malicious eye, with which a covetous guardian would view his ward who&s;e e&s;tate he had been enriching him&s;elf by for twenty years, and &s;aw him ju&s;t arriving at manhood. And America owes no more to Britain for her pre&s;ent maturity, than the ward would to his guardian for being twenty-one years of age. That America hath flouri&s;hed <HI>at the time</HI> &s;he was under the government of Britain, is true; but there is every natural
<PB N="33" REF="015494_0009_0F998668ECD55B20">
rea&s;on to believe, that had &s;he been an independent country from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement thereof, uncontrouled by any foreign power, free to make her own laws, regulate and encourage her own commerce, &s;he had by this time been of much greater worth than now. The ca&s;e is &s;imply this, The fir&s;t &s;ettlers in the different Colonies were left to &s;hift for them|&s;elves, unnoticed and un&s;upported by any European govern|ment; but as the tyranny and per&s;ecution of the old world daily drove numbers to the new, and, as by the favour of Heaven on their indu&s;try and per&s;everance, they grew into importance, &s;o, in a like degree, they became an object of profit to the greedy eyes of Europe. It was impo&s;&s;ible in this &s;tate of infancy, however thriving and promi&s;ing, that they could re&s;i&s;t the power of any armed invader that &s;hould &s;eek to bring them under his authority. In this &s;ituation Britain thought it worth her while to claim them, and the Continent received and acknowledged the claimer. It was, in reality, of no very great importance who was her ma&s;ter, &s;eeing, that from the force and ambition of the dif|ferent powers of Europe &s;he mu&s;t, till &s;he acquired &s;trength enough to a&s;&s;ert her own right, acknowledge &s;ome one. As well, perhaps, Britain as another; and it might have been as well to have been under the States of Holland as any. The &s;ame hopes of engro&s;&s;ing and profiting by her trade, by not oppre&s;&s;ing it too much, would have operated alike with any ma&s;ter, and produced to the Colonies the &s;ame ef|fects. The clamor of protection, likewi&s;e, was all a farce; becau&s;e, in order to make <HI>that</HI> protection nece&s;&s;ary, &s;he mu&s;t fir&s;t, by her own quarrels create us enemies. Hard terms, indeed!</P>
<P>TO know whether it be the intere&s;t of the Continent to be independent, we need only a&s;k this ea&s;y, &s;imple que&s;tion: Is it the intere&s;t of a man to be a boy all his life? The an&s;wer to one will be the an&s;wer to both. America hath been one continued &s;cene of legi&s;lative contention from the fir&s;t king's repre&s;entative to the la&s;t; and this was unavoid|ably founded in the natural oppo&s;ition of intere&s;t between the old country and the new. A governor &s;ent from England, or receiving his authority therefrom, ought never to have been con&s;idered in any other light than that of a genteel commi&s;&s;ioned &s;py, who&s;e private bu&s;ine&s;s was in|formation,
<PB N="34" REF="015494_0010_0F998669A08CAFF8">
and his public bu&s;ine&s;s a kind of civilized op|pre&s;&s;ion. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e characters he was to watch the tempers, &s;entiments and di&s;po&s;ition of the people, the growth of trade, and the encrea&s;e of private fortunes; and in the latter, to &s;uppre&s;s all &s;uch acts of the A&s;&s;emblies, how|ever beneficial to the people, which did not directly or indi|rectly throw &s;ome encrea&s;e of power or profit into the hands of tho&s;e who &s;ent him.</P>
<P>AMERICA, till now, could never be called a <HI>free country,</HI> becau&s;e her legi&s;lation depended on the will of a man three thou&s;and miles di&s;tant, who&s;e intere&s;t was in oppo&s;ition to ours, and who, by a &s;ingle "NO," could forbid what law he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE freedom of trade, likewi&s;e, is, to a trading country, an article of &s;uch va&s;t importance, that the principal &s;ource of wealth depends upon it; and it is impo&s;&s;ible that any country can flouri&s;h, as it otherwi&s;e might do, who&s;e com|merce is engro&s;&s;ed, cramped and fettered by the laws and mandates of another&mdash;yet the&s;e evils, and more than I can here enumerate, the Continent has &s;uffered by being under the government of Great-Britain. By an Independence we clear the whole at once&mdash;put an end to the bu&s;ine&s;s of un|an&s;wered petitions and fruitle&s;s remon&s;trances&mdash;exchange Britain for Europe&mdash;&s;hake hands with the world&mdash;live at peace with mankind&mdash;and trade to any market where we be&s;t can buy and &s;ell.</P>
<P N="3">III. THE NECESSITY, likewi&s;e, of being independent, even before it was declared, became &s;o evident and im|portant, that the Continent ran the ri&s;k of being ruined every day &s;he delayed it. There were rea&s;ons to believe that Britain would endeavour to make a European matter of it, and rather than lo&s;e the whole, would di&s;member it like Poland, and di&s;po&s;e of her &s;everal claims to the highe&s;t bid|der. Genoa, failing in her attempts to reduce Cor&s;ica, made a &s;ale of it to the French, and &s;uch traffics have been common in the old world. We had at that time no Am|ba&s;&s;ador in any part of Europe, to counteract her negocia|tions, and by that means &s;he had the range of every foreign Court uncontradicted on our part. We even knew nothing
<PB N="35" REF="015494_0011_0F99866A675F2D88">
of the treaty for the He&s;&s;ians till it was concluded, and the troops ready to embark. Had we been independent before, we had probably prevented her obtaining them. We had no credit abroad, becau&s;e of our rebellious dependency. Our &s;hips could claim no protection in foreign ports, becau&s;e we afforded them no ju&s;tifiable rea&s;on for granting it to us. The calling our&s;elves &s;ubjects, and at the &s;ame time fighting again&s;t the power we acknowledged, was a dangerous pre|cedent to all Europe. If the grievances ju&s;tified our taking up arms, they ju&s;tified our &s;eparation; if they did not ju&s;tify our &s;eparation, neither could they ju&s;tify our taking up arms. All Europe was intere&s;ted in reducing us as rebels, and all Europe (or the greate&s;t part at lea&s;t) is intere&s;ted in &s;up|porting us as Independent States. At home our con|dition was &s;till wor&s;e: Our currency had no foundation, and the fall of it would have ruined Whig and Tory alike. We had no other law than a kind of moderated pa&s;&s;ion; no other civil power than an hone&s;t mob; and no other protection than the temporary attachment of one man to another. Had Independence been delayed a few months longer, this Continent would have been plunged into irre|coverable confu&s;ion: Some violent for it, &s;ome again&s;t it, till in the general cabal the rich would have been ruined, and the poor de&s;troyed. It is to Independence that every Tory owes the pre&s;ent &s;afety he lives in; for by <HI>that,</HI> and <HI>that only,</HI> we emerged from a &s;tate of dangerous &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and became a regular people.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity likewi&s;e of being independent, had there been no rupture between Britain and America, would in a little time have brought one on. The encrea&s;ing importance of commerce, the weight and perplexity of legi&s;lation, and the entangled &s;tate of European politics, would daily have &s;hewn to the Continent the impo&s;&s;ibility of continuing &s;ub|ordinate; for, after the coole&s;t reflections on the matter, <HI>this mu&s;t</HI> be allowed, that Britain was too jealous of America, to govern it ju&s;tly; too ignorant of it, to govern it well; and too di&s;tant from it, to govern it at all.</P>
<P N="4">IV. BUT, what weigh mo&s;t with all men of &s;erious re|flection are the MORAL ADVANTAGES ari&s;ing from Inde|pendence: War and de&s;olation are become the trades of the

old world; and America neither could, nor can be under the government of Britain without becoming a &s;harer of her guilt, and a partner in all the di&s;mal commerce of death. The &s;pirit of duelling, extended on a national &s;cale, is a proper character for European wars. They have &s;eldom any other motive than pride, or any other object than fame. The con|querors and the conquered are generally ruined alike, and the chief difference at la&s;t is, that the one marches home with his honours, and the other without them. 'Tis the natural temper of the Engli&s;h to fight for a feather, if they &s;uppo&s;e <HI>that feather</HI> to be an affront; and America, without the right of a&s;king why, mu&s;t have abetted in every quarrel and abided by its fate. It is a &s;hocking &s;ituation to live in, that one country mu&s;t be brought into all the wars of another, whether the mea&s;ure be right or wrong, or whether &s;he will or not; yet this, in the fulle&s;t extent, was, and ever would be, the unavoidable con&s;equence of the connection. Surely! the Quakers forgot their own principles, when in their late te&s;timony they called <HI>this connection</HI> with the&s;e military and mi&s;erable appendages hanging to it, <HI>"The happy con|&s;titution."</HI></P>
<P>BRITAIN, for centuries pa&s;t, have been nearly fifty years out of every hundred at war with &s;ome power or other. It certainly ought to be a con&s;cientious as well as political con|&s;ideration with America, not to dip her hands in the bloody work of Europe. Our &s;ituation affords us a retreat from their cabals, and the pre&s;ent happy union of the States bid fair for extirpating the future u&s;e of arms from one quarter of the world; yet &s;uch have been the irreligious politics of the pre&s;ent leaders of the Quakers, that, for the &s;ake of they &s;carce know what, they would cut off every hope of &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing by tying this Continent to Britain, like Hector to the chariot-wheel of Achilles, to be dragged through all the mi&s;eries of endle&s;s European wars.</P>
<P>THE connection, viewed from this ground, is di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to every man who has the feelings of humanity. By having Britain for our ma&s;ter, we became enemies to the greate&s;t part of Europe, and they to us; and the con&s;equence was war inevitable. By being our own ma&s;ters, independent of any foreign one, we have Europe for our friends, and the
<PB N="37" REF="015494_0013_0F99866BF354F5F0">
pro&s;pect of an endle&s;s peace among our&s;elves. Tho&s;e who were advocates for the Briti&s;h government over the&s;e Colo|nies, were obliged to limit both their arguments and their ideas to the period of a European peace only: The moment Britain became plunged in war, every &s;uppo&s;ed convenience to us vani&s;hed away, and all we could hope for was <HI>not to be ruined.</HI> Could this be a de&s;irable condition for a young country to be in?</P>
<P>HAD the French pur&s;ued their fortune immediately after the defeat of Braddock la&s;t war, this city and province had then experienced the woful calamities of being a Briti&s;h &s;ub|ject. A &s;cene of the &s;ame kind might happen again; for America, con&s;idered as a &s;ubject to the crown of Britain, would ever have been the &s;eat of war and the bone of con|tention between the two powers.</P>
<P>ON the whole, If the future expul&s;ion of arms from one quarter of the world be a de&s;irable object to a peaceable man;&mdash;if the freedom of trade to every part of it can en|gage the attention of a man of bu&s;ine&s;s,&mdash;if the &s;upport or fall of millions of currency can affect our intere&s;t;&mdash;if the entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of e&s;tates, by cutting off the lordly claims of Britain over the &s;oil, de&s;erves the regard of landed property;&mdash; and if the right of making our own laws, uncontrouled by royal or mini&s;terial &s;pies or mandates, be worthy our care as freemen;&mdash;then are all men intere&s;ted in the &s;upport of Independence, and may he that &s;upports it not, be driven from the ble&s;&s;ing, and live unpitied beneath the &s;ervile &s;uffer|ings of &s;candalous &s;ubjection!</P>
<P>WE have been amu&s;ed with the tales of ancient wonders; we have read, and wept over, the hi&s;tories of other nations; applauded, cen&s;ured, or pitied, as their ca&s;es affected us.&mdash; The fortitude and patience of the &s;ufferers&mdash;the ju&s;tne&s;s of their cau&s;e&mdash;the weight of their oppre&s;&s;ions and oppre&s;&s;ors&mdash; the object to be &s;aved or lo&s;t&mdash;with all the con&s;equences of a defeat or a conque&s;t&mdash;have, in the hour of &s;ympathy, be|witched our hearts and chained it to their fate: But where is the power that ever made war upon petitioners? Or where is the war on which a world was &s;taked till now?</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="015494_0014_0F99866D39616078">WE may not, perhaps, be wi&s;e enough to make all the advantages we ought of our Independence; but they are, neverthele&s;s, marked and pre&s;ented to us with every character of GREAT and GOOD, and worthy the hand of Him who &s;ent them. I look through the pre&s;ent trouble to a time of tranquillity, when we &s;hall have it in our power to &s;et an example of peace to all the world. Were the Quakers really impre&s;&s;ed and influenced by the quiet principles they profe&s;s to hold, they would, however they might di&s;approve the means, be the fir&s;t of all men to approve of INDEPENDENCE, becau&s;e, by &s;eparating from the cities of Sodom and Go|morrah, it affords an opportunity, never given to man be|fore, of carrying their favourite principle of peace into ge|neral practice, by e&s;tabli&s;hing governments that &s;hall here|after exi&s;t without wars. Oh ye fallen, cringing prie&s;t- and Pemberton-ridden people! what more can we &s;ay of ye than that a religious Quaker is a valuable character, and a poli|tical Quaker a real Je&s;uit.</P>
<P>HAVING thus gone over &s;ome of the principal points in &s;upport of Independence, I mu&s;t now reque&s;t the reader to return back with me to the period when it fir&s;t began to be a public doctrine, and examine the progre&s;s it has made among the various cla&s;&s;es of men. The era I mean to begin at, is the breaking out of ho&s;tilities, April 19th, 1775. Until this event happened, the Continent &s;eemed to view the di&s;pute as a kind of law&s;uit for a matter of right, liti|gating between the old country and the new; and &s;he felt the &s;ame kind and degree of horror, as if &s;he had &s;een an op|pre&s;&s;ive plaintiff, at the head of a band of ruffians, enter the court, while the cau&s;e was before it, and put the judge, the jury, the defendant and his council to the &s;word. Perhaps a more heart-felt convul&s;ion never reached a country with the &s;ame degree of power and rapidity before, and never may again. Pity for the &s;ufferers, mixt with indignation at the violence and heightened with apprehen&s;ions of undergoing the &s;ame fate, made the affair of Lexington the affair of the Continent. Every part of it felt the &s;hock, and all vibrated together. A general promotion of &s;entiment took place: Tho&s;e who had drank deeply into Whiggi&s;h principles, that is, the right and nece&s;&s;ity not only of oppo&s;ing, but wholly &s;etting a&s;ide the power of the Crown as &s;oon as it became
<PB N="39" REF="015494_0015_0F99866D9922B140">
practically dangerous (for in theory it was always &s;o) &s;tept into the fir&s;t &s;tage of Independence; while another cla&s;s of Whigs, equally &s;ound in principle, but not &s;o &s;anguine in enterprize, attached them&s;elves the &s;tronger to the cau&s;e and fell clo&s;e in with the rear of the former; their partition was a mere point. Numbers of the moderate men, who&s;e chief fault, <HI>at that time,</HI> aro&s;e from their entertaining a better opi|nion of Britain than &s;he de&s;erved, convinced now of their mi&s;take, gave her up and publicly declared them&s;elves good Whigs. While the Tories, &s;eeing it was no longer a laugh|ing matter, either &s;lunk into &s;ilent ob&s;curity, or contented them&s;elves with coming forth and abu&s;ing General Gage: Not a &s;ingle advocate appeared to ju&s;tify the action of that day; it &s;eemed to appear to every one with the &s;ame mag|nitude, &s;truck every one with the &s;ame force, and created in every one the &s;ame abhorrence. From this period we may date the growth of Independence.</P>
<P>IF the many circum&s;tances, which happened at this me|morable time, be taken in one view, and compared with each other, they will ju&s;tify a conclu&s;ion which &s;eems not to be attended to, I mean a fixt de&s;ign in the king and mi|ni&s;try of driving America into arms, in order that they might be furni&s;hed with a pretence for &s;eizing the whole Continent as the immediate property of the Crown. A noble plunder for hungry courtiers!</P>
<P>IT ought to be remembered, that the fir&s;t petition from the Congre&s;s was at this time unan&s;wered on the part of the Briti&s;h king. That the motion, called Lord North's mo|tion, of the 20th of February, 1775, arrived in America the latter end of March. This motion was to be laid by the &s;e|veral governors, then in being, before the A&s;&s;embly of each province; and the fir&s;t A&s;&s;embly before which it was laid, was the A&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania in <HI>May</HI> following. This being a ju&s;t &s;tate of the ca&s;e, I then a&s;k, why were ho&s;tilities commenced between the time of pa&s;&s;ing the re&s;olve in the Hou&s;e of Commons, of the 20th of February, and the time of the A&s;&s;emblies meeting to deliberate upon it? Degrading and infamous as that motion was, there is, neverthele&s;s, rea&s;on to believe, that the king and his adherents were afraid the Colonies would agree to it, and le&s;t they &s;hould, took
<PB N="40" REF="015494_0016_0F99866EAB0F3568">
effectual care they &s;hould not, by provoking them with ho|&s;tilities in the interim. They had not the lea&s;t doubt at that time of conquering America at one blow; and what they expected to get by a conque&s;t being infinitely greater than any thing they could hope to get either by taxation or ac|commodation, they &s;eemed determined to prevent even the po&s;&s;ibility of hearing each other, le&s;t America &s;hould di&s;ap|point their greedy hopes of the whole, by li&s;tening even to their own terms. On the one hand they refu&s;ed to hear the petition of the Continent, and on the other hand took ef|fectual care the Continent &s;hould not hear them.</P>
<P>THAT the motion of the 20th of February and the or|ders for commencing ho&s;tilities were both concerted by the &s;ame PERSON or per&s;ons, and not the latter by General Gage, as was fal&s;ely imagined at fir&s;t, is evident from an extract of a letter of his to admini&s;tration, read among other papers in the Hou&s;e of Commons; in which he informs his ma&s;ters, <HI>That though their idea of his di&s;arming certain counties was a right one, yet it required him to be ma&s;ter of the country, in order to enable him to execute it.</HI> This was prior to the commencement of ho&s;tilities, and con&s;equently before the motion of the 20th of February could be deliberated on by the &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it may be a&s;ked, why was the motion pa&s;t, if there was at the &s;ame time a plan to aggravate the Ameri|cans not to li&s;ten to it? Lord North a&s;&s;igned one rea&s;on him&s;elf, which was, <HI>a hope of dividing them.</HI> This was pu|blicly tempting them to reject it; that if, in ca&s;e, the in|jury of arms &s;hould fail of provoking them &s;ufficiently, the in&s;ult of &s;uch a declaration might fill it up. But by pa&s;s|ing the motion and getting it afterwards rejected in Ame|rica, it enabled them, in their wretched idea of politics, among other things, to hold up the Colonies to foreign powers with every po&s;&s;ible mark of di&s;obedience and rebel|lion. They had applied to tho&s;e powers not to &s;upply the Continent with arms, ammunition, &amp;c. and it was nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould incen&s;e them again&s;t us, by a&s;&s;igning on their own part &s;ome &s;eeming reputable rea&s;on why. By dividing, it had a tendency to weaken the States, and likewi&s;e to per|plex the adherents of America in England. But the principal
<PB N="41" REF="015494_0017_0F99866EDFBF3A50">
&s;cheme, and that which has marked their character in every part of their conduct, was a de&s;ign of precipitating the Co|lonies into a &s;tate which they might afterwards deem rebel|lion, and under that pretence put an end to all future com|plaints, petitions or remon&s;trances, by &s;eizing the whole at once. They had ravaged one part of the globe, till it could glut them no longer; their prodigality required new plunder, and through the Ea&s;t-India article TEA they hoped to trans|fer their rapine from that quarter of the world to this.&mdash; Every de&s;igned quarrel has its pretence; and the &s;ame bar|barian avarice accompanied the <HI>Plant</HI> to America, which ruined the country that produced it.</P>
<P>THAT men never turn rogues without turning fools, is a maxim, &s;ooner or later, univer&s;ally true. The commence|ment of ho&s;tilities, being in the beginning of April, was, of all times, the wor&s;t cho&s;en: The Congre&s;s were to meet the tenth of May following, and the di&s;tre&s;s the Continent felt at this unparalleled outrage gave a &s;tability to <HI>That Body,</HI> which no other circum&s;tance could have done. It &s;uppre&s;&s;ed too all inferior debates, and bound them together by a nece&s;&s;itous affection, without giving them time to differ upon trifles. The &s;uffering likewi&s;e, &s;oftened the whole body of the people into a degree of pliability, which laid the principal founda|tion &s;tone of union, order and government; and which, at any other time, might only have fretted and then faded away unnoticed and unimproved: But Providence, who be&s;t knows how to time her misfortunes as well as her immediate favours, cho&s;e this to be the time: And who dares di&s;pute it?</P>
<P>IT did not &s;eem the di&s;po&s;ition of the people at this cri&s;is to heap petition upon petition, while the former remained unan&s;wered: The mea&s;ure, however, was carried in Con|gre&s;s, and a &s;econd petition was &s;ent; of which I &s;hall only remark, that it was &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive even to a dangerous fault, becau&s;e the prayer of it appealed &s;olely to, what is called, the prerogative of the Crown, while the matter in di&s;pute was confe&s;&s;ed to be con&s;titutional. But even this Petition, flattering as it was, was &s;till not &s;o harmonious as the chink of ca&s;h, and con&s;equently not &s;ufficiently grateful to the tyrant and his mini&s;try. From every circum&s;tance it is evident, that it was the determination of the Briti&s;h court
<PB N="42" REF="015494_0018_0F9986721CB2AA18">
to have nothing to do with America but to conquer it fully and ab&s;olutely. They were certain of &s;ucce&s;s, and the field of battle was to be the only place of treaty. I am confident there are thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands in America who wonder <HI>now</HI> they &s;hould ever think otherwi&s;e; but the &s;in of that day was the &s;in of Civility, yet it operated again&s;t our pre&s;ent good in the &s;ame manner that a civil opinion of the devil would again&s;t our future peace.</P>
<P>INDEPENDENCE was a doctrine &s;carce and rare even to|wards the conclu&s;ion of the year Seventy-five: All our po|litics had been founded on the hope or expectation of make|ing the matter up&mdash;a hope, which, though general on the &s;ide of America, had never entered the head or heart of the Briti&s;h court. Their hope was conque&s;t and confi&s;cation. Good Heavens! what volumes of thanks does America owe to Britain! What infinite obligations to the fool, that fills, with paradoxical vacancy, the throne! Nothing but the &s;harpe&s;t e&s;&s;ence of villany, compounded with the &s;tronge&s;t di&s;tillation of folly, could have produced a men&s;truum that would have effected a &s;eparation. The Congre&s;s in Seventy-four admini&s;tered an abortive medicine to Independence, by prohibiting the importation of goods, and the &s;ucceeding Congre&s;s rendered the do&s;e &s;till more dangerous by con|tinuing it. Had Independence been a &s;ettled &s;y&s;tem with America (as Britain has advanced) &s;he ought to have <HI>doubled</HI> her importation, and prohibited in &s;ome degree her exporta|tion. And this &s;ingle circum&s;tance is &s;ufficient to acquit America before any jury of nations of having a Continental plan of Independence in view: A charge, which had it been true, would have been honourable, but is &s;o gro&s;sly fal&s;e, that either the amazing ignorance, or the wilful di&s;hone&s;ty, of the Briti&s;h court is effectually proved by it.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd petition like the fir&s;t produced no an&s;wer; it was &s;carcely acknowledged to be received; the Briti&s;h court were too determined in their villany even to act it artfully, and in their rage for conque&s;t neglected the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ubtleties for obtaining it. They might have divided, di&s;tracted and played a thou&s;and tricks with us had they been as cun|ning as they were cruel.</P>
<P>THIS la&s;t indignity gave a new &s;pring to Independence.
<PB N="43" REF="015494_0019_0F998673334F8F20">
Tho&s;e who knew the &s;avage ob&s;tinacy of the king and the jobbing gambling &s;pirit of the court predicted the fate of the petition as &s;oon as it was &s;ent from America; for the men being known, their mea&s;ures were ea&s;ily fore&s;een. As poli|ticians we ought not &s;o much to ground our hope on the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the thing we a&s;k, as on the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the per&s;on of whom we a&s;k it: Who would expect di&s;cre|tion from a fool, candour from a tyrant, or ju&s;tice from a villain?</P>
<P>AS every pro&s;pect of an accommodation &s;eemed now to fail fa&s;t, men began to think &s;eriou&s;ly on the matter; and their rea&s;on being thus &s;tript of the fal&s;e hope which had long encompa&s;&s;ed it, became approachable by fair debate; yet &s;till the bulk of the people he&s;itated; they &s;tartled at the novelty of Independence, without once con&s;idering that our getting into arms at fir&s;t was a more extraordinary novelty, and that all other nations had gone through the work of In|dependence before us. They doubted, likewi&s;e, the ability of the Continent to &s;upport it, without reflecting, that it required the &s;ame force to obtain an accommodation by arms as an Independence. If the one was acquireable, the other was the &s;ame; becau&s;e, to accompli&s;h either, it was nece&s;|&s;ary that our &s;trength &s;hould be too great for Britain to &s;ub|due; and it was too unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that with the power of being ma&s;ters, we &s;hould &s;ubmit to be &s;ervants.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this &s;tate of political &s;u&s;pen&s;e the pamphlet <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> made its appearance, and the &s;ucce&s;s it met with does not become me to mention. Dr. Franklin, Mr. Samuel and John Adams were &s;everally &s;poken of as the &s;uppo&s;ed Author. I had not, at that time, the plea&s;ure either of per&s;onally knowing or being known to the two la&s;t Gentlemen. The favour of Dr. Franklin's friend|&s;hip I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in England, and my introduction to this part of the world was through his patronage. I happened, when a &s;chool boy, to pick up a plea&s;ing natural hi&s;tory of Virginia, and my inclination from that day of &s;eeing the we&s;tern &s;ide of the atlantic never left me. In October, Seventy-five. Dr. Franklin propo&s;ed giving me &s;uch materials as were in his hands, towards compleating a hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent tran&s;|actions, and &s;eemed de&s;irous of having the fir&s;t volume out by the next &s;pring. I had then formed the outlines of Common Sen&s;e, and fini&s;hed nearly the fir&s;t part; and as I &s;up|po&s;ed the Doctor's de&s;ign in getting out a hi&s;tory, was to open the new year with a new &s;y&s;tem, I expected to &s;urprize him with a production on that &s;ubject much earlier than he thought of; and without informing him of what I was doing, got it ready for the pre&s;s as fa&s;t as I conveniently could, and &s;ent him the fir&s;t pamphlet that was printed off.</NOTE> Their caution, at this time, was exceedingly mi&s;placed; for if they were able to defend their property and maintain their

rights by arms, they con&s;equently were able to defend and &s;upport their Independence; and in proportion as the&s;e men &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity and rightne&s;s of the mea&s;ure, they hone&s;tly and openly declared and adopted it, and the part they have acted &s;ince, have done them honour, and fully e&s;tabli&s;hed their characters. Error in opinion has this peculiar advan|tage with it, that the foremo&s;t point of the contrary ground may at any time be reached by the &s;udden exertion of a thought; and it frequently happens in &s;entimental differences that &s;ome &s;triking circum&s;tance, or &s;ome forcible rea&s;on, quickly conceived, will effect in an in&s;tant what neither ar|gument nor example could produce in an age.</P>
<P>I find it impo&s;&s;ible in the &s;mall compa&s;s I am limited to, to trace out the progre&s;s which Independence has made on the minds of the different cla&s;&s;es of men, and the &s;everal rea&s;ons by which they were moved. With &s;ome, it was a pa&s;&s;ionate abhorrence again&s;t the king of England and his mini&s;try as a &s;et of &s;avages and brutes; and the&s;e men, go|verned by the agony of a wounded mind, were for tru&s;ting every thing to hope and Heaven and bidding defiance at once. With others, it was a growing conviction that the &s;cheme of the Briti&s;h court was to create, ferment and drive on a quarrel for the &s;ake of confi&s;cated plunder: Men of this ca&s;t ripened into Independence in proportion as the evi|dence encrea&s;ed. While a third cla&s;s, conceiving it was the true intere&s;t of America, internally and externally, to be her own ma&s;ter, gave their &s;upport to Independence, &s;tep by &s;tep, as they &s;aw her abilities to maintain it enlarge. With many it was a compound of all the&s;e rea&s;ons; while tho&s;e, who were too callous to be reached by neither, remained, and &s;till remain Tories.</P>
<P>THE <HI>legal nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of being independent, with &s;everal col|lateral rea&s;ons, is pointed out in an elegant, ma&s;terly man|ner,

<P>THE connection between vice and meanne&s;s is a fit ob|ject for &s;atire, but when the &s;atire is a fact, it cuts with the irre&s;i&s;tible power of a diamond. If a Quaker, in defence of his ju&s;t rights, his property and the cha&s;tity of his hou&s;e, takes up a mu&s;ket, he is expelled the meeting; but the pre|&s;ent king of England, who &s;educed and took into keeping a &s;i&s;ter of their &s;ociety, is reverenced and &s;upported with re|peated te&s;timonies, while the friendly noodle from whom &s;he was taken, (and who is now in this city) continues a drudge in the &s;ervice of his rival, as if proud of being cuckolded by a creature called a king.</P>
<P>OUR &s;upport and &s;ucce&s;s depend on &s;uch a variety of men and circum&s;tances, that every one, who does but wi&s;h well, is of &s;ome u&s;e: There are men who have a &s;trange awk|wardne&s;s to arms, yet have hearts to ri&s;k every &s;hilling in the cau&s;e, or in &s;upport of tho&s;e who have better talents for defending it. Nature, in the arrangement of mankind, has fitted &s;ome for every &s;ervice in life: Were all &s;oldiers, all would &s;tarve and go naked, and were none &s;oldiers, all would

be &s;laves. As <HI>di&s;affection</HI> to Independence is the badge of a Tory, &s;o <HI>affection</HI> to it is the mark of a Whig; and the different &s;ervices of the Whigs down from tho&s;e who nobly contribute every thing, to tho&s;e who have nothing to render but their wi&s;hes, tend all to the &s;ame centre, though with different degrees of merit and ability. The larger we make the circle, the more we &s;hall harmonize, and the &s;tronger we &s;hall be. All we want to &s;hut out, is di&s;affection, and <HI>that excluded,</HI> we mu&s;t accept from each other &s;uch duties as we are be&s;t fitted to be&s;tow. A narrow &s;y&s;tem of politics, like a narrow &s;y&s;tem of religion, is calculated only to four the temper, and live at variance with mankind.</P>
<P>ALL we want to know in America is &s;imply this, Who is for Independence, and who is not? Tho&s;e who are for it, will &s;upport it, and the remainder will undoubtedly &s;ee the rea&s;onablene&s;s of their paying the charges; while tho&s;e who oppo&s;e, or &s;eek to betray it, mu&s;t expect the more rigid fate of the jail and the gibbet. There is a kind of ba&s;tard ge|nero&s;ity, which, by being extended to all men, is as fatal to &s;ociety, on one hand, as the want of true genero&s;ity is on the other. A lax manner of admini&s;tring ju&s;tice, fal&s;ely termed moderation, has a tendency both to di&s;pirit public virtue and promote the growth of public evils. Had the late Committee of Safety taken cognizance of the la&s;t te&s;timony of the Quakers, and proceeded again&s;t &s;uch delinquents as were concerned therein, they had, probably, prevented the trea&s;onable plans which have been concerted &s;ince. When one villain is &s;uffered to e&s;cape, it encourages another to proceed, either from a hope of e&s;caping likewi&s;e, or an ap|prehen&s;ion that we dare not puni&s;h. It has been a matter of general &s;urpri&s;e, that no notice was taken of the incendiary publication of the Quakers, of the 20th of November la&s;t: A publication evidently intended to promote &s;edition and trea&s;on, and encourage the enemy, who were then within a day's march of this city, to proceed on and po&s;&s;e&s;s it. I here pre&s;ent the reader with a memorial, which was laid be|fore the Board of Safety a few days after the te&s;timony ap|peared. Not a member of that Board, that I conver&s;ed with but expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t dete&s;tation of the perverted principles and conduct of the Quaker junto, and that the Board would take the matter up; notwith&s;tanding which,

<HEAD>To the <HI>HONOURABLE</HI> the <HI>COUNCIL OF SAFETY</HI> of the State of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">At a meeting of a reputable number of the inhabitants of the city of Philadelphia, impre&s;&s;ed with a proper &s;en&s;e of the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e which this Continent is engaged in, and animated with a generous fervor for &s;upporting the &s;ame, it was re&s;olved, that the following be laid before the Board of Safety:</HEAD>
<P>WE profe&s;s liberality of &s;entiment to all men; with this di&s;tinction <HI>only,</HI> that tho&s;e who do <HI>not</HI> de&s;erve it, would become wi&s;e and <HI>&s;eek</HI> to de&s;erve it. We hold the pure doctrine of univer&s;al liberty of con&s;cience, and conceive it our duty to en|deavour to &s;ecure that &s;acred right to others, as well as to defend it for our&s;elves; for we undertake not to judge of the religious rectitude of tenets, but leave the whole matter to Him who made us.</P>
<P>"WE per&s;ecute no man, neither will we abet in the per&s;ecu|tion of any man for religion &s;ake; our common relation to others being that of fellow-citizens and fellow-&s;ubjects of one civil com|munity; and in this line of connection we hold out the right hand of fellow&s;hip to all men. But we &s;hould conceive our&s;elves to be unworthy members of the FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES OF AMERICA, were we unconcernedly to &s;ee or &s;uffer any trea|&s;onable wound, public or private, directly or indirectly, to be given again&s;t the peace and &s;afety of the &s;ame. We enquire not into the rank of the offenders, nor their religious per&s;ua&s;ion; we have no bu&s;ine&s;s with either, our part being only to find them out, and exhibit them to ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>A printed paper, dated the 20th of November, and &s;igned <HI>John Pemberton,</HI> whom we &s;uppo&s;e to be an inhabitant of this city, has lately been di&s;per&s;ed abroad, a copy of which accompanies this. Had the framers and publi&s;hers of that paper conceived it their duty to exhort the youth, and others, of their &s;ociety, to a patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion under pre&s;ent trying vi&s;itations, and humbly to wait the event of Heaven towards them, they had therein &s;hewn a Chri&s;tian temper, and we had been &s;ilent; but the anger and po|litical virulence with which their in&s;tructions are given, and the abu&s;e with which they &s;tigmatize all ranks of men, not thinking
<PB N="48" REF="015494_0024_0F998677325BB940">
like them&s;elves, leave no doubt on our minds from what &s;pirit their publication proceeded: And it is di&s;graceful to the pure cau&s;e of truth, that men can dally with words of the mo&s;t &s;acred import, and play them as mechanically off as if religion con&s;i&s;ted only in contrivance. We know of no in&s;tance, in which the Qua|kers have been compelled to bear arms, or do any thing which might &s;train their con&s;cience; wherefore their advice <Q>to with|&s;tand and refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to the arbitrary in&s;tructions and ordi|nances of men,</Q> appear to us a fal&s;e alarm, and could only be trea&s;onably calculated to gain favour with our enemies, when they were &s;eemingly on the brink of invading this State, or, what is &s;till wor&s;e, to weaken the hands of our defence, that their entrance into this city might be made practicable and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>"WE di&s;claim all tumult and di&s;order in the puni&s;hment of offenders; and wi&s;h to be governed, not by temper but by rea&s;on, in the manner of treating them. We are &s;en&s;ible that our cau&s;e has &s;uffered by the two following errors; by an ill-judged lenity to traiterous per&s;ons in &s;ome ca&s;es; and &s;econdly, by only a pa&s;&s;ionate treatment of them in others. For the future we di&s;|own both, and wi&s;h to be &s;teady in our proceedings, and &s;erious in our puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>"EVERY State in America has by the repeated voice of its inhabitants, directed and authori&s;ed the Continental Congre&s;s to publi&s;h a formal Declaration of Independence of, and Separation from, the oppre&s;&s;ive king and parliament of Great-Britain; and we look on every man an enemy who does not in &s;ome line or other give his a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards &s;upporting the &s;ame; at the &s;ame time we con&s;ider the offence to be heightened to a degree of un|pardonable guilt, when &s;uch per&s;ons, under the &s;hew of religion, endeavour, either by writing, &s;peaking, or otherwi&s;e, to &s;ubvert, overturn, or bring reproach upon the Independence of this Con|tinent as declared by Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>"THE publi&s;hers of the paper, &s;igned <HI>"John Pemberton,"</HI> have called in a loud and pa&s;&s;ionate manner on their friends and connections, to <HI>"with&s;tand and refu&s;e"</HI> obedience to whatever <HI>"in|&s;tructions or ordinances"</HI> may be publi&s;hed, not warranted by (what they call) <Q>THAT HAPPY CONSTITUTION UNDER WHICH THEY AND OTHERS LONG ENJOYED TRANQUILLITY AND PEACE.</Q> If this be not trea&s;on, we know not what may pro|perly be called by that name.</P>
<P>"TO us it is a matter of &s;urpri&s;e and a&s;toni&s;hment, that men with the word <HI>"peace, peace"</HI> continually on their lips, &s;hould
<PB N="49" REF="015494_0025_0F99867849A7F838">
be &s;o fond of living under, and &s;upporting a government and at the &s;ame time calling it <HI>"happy,"</HI> which is never better plea&s;ed than when at war&mdash;that hath filled India with carnage and famine&mdash;Africa with &s;lavery&mdash;and tampered with Indians and Negroes to cut the throats of the freemen of America. We con|ceive it a di&s;grace to this State to harbour or wink at &s;uch palpable hypocri&s;y. But as we &s;eek not to hurt the hair of any man's head, when we can make our&s;elves &s;afe without, we wi&s;h &s;uch per&s;ons to re&s;tore peace to them&s;elves and us, by removing them&s;elves to &s;ome part of the king of Britain's dominions, as by that means they may live unmole&s;ted by us or we by them; for our fixt opinion is, that tho&s;e who do not de&s;erve a place among us, ought not to have one.</P>
<P>"WE conclude, with reque&s;ting the Council of Safety to take into their con&s;ideration the paper &s;igned <HI>"John Pemberton;"</HI> and if it &s;hall appear to them to be of a dangerous tendency, or of a trea&s;onable nature, that they would commit the &s;igner, together with &s;uch other per&s;ons as they can di&s;cover were concerned there|in, into cu&s;tody, until &s;uch time as &s;ome mode of trial &s;hall a&s;cer|tain the full degree of their guilt and puni&s;hment; in the doing of which, we wi&s;h their judges, whoever they may be, to di&s;regard the man, his connections, intere&s;t, riches, poverty or principles of religion, and to attend to the nature of his offence only."</P>

<P>THE mo&s;t cavilling &s;ectarian cannot accu&s;e the foregoing with containing the lea&s;t ingredient of per&s;ecution. The free &s;pi|rit on which the American cau&s;e is founded, di&s;dains to mix with &s;uch an impurity, and leave it a rubbi&s;h fit only for narrow and &s;u&s;picious minds to grovel in: Su&s;picion and per&s;ecution are weeds of the &s;ame dunghill, and flouri&s;h be&s;t together. Had the Quakers minded their religion and their bu&s;ine&s;s, they might have lived through this di&s;pute in enviable ea&s;e, and none would have mole&s;ted them. The common phra&s;e with the&s;e people is, <HI>"Our principles are peace."</HI> To which may be replied, <HI>and your practices are the rever&s;e;</HI> for never did the conduct of men oppo&s;e their own doctrine more notoriou&s;ly than the pre&s;ent race of the Qua|kers. They have artfully changed them&s;elves into a different &s;ort of people to what they u&s;ed to be, and yet have the addre&s;s to per&s;uade each other they are not altered; like antiquated virgins they &s;ee not the havoc deformity hath made upon them, but plea&s;antly mi&s;taking wrinkles for dimples, conceit them&s;elves yet lovely, and wonder at the &s;tupid world for not admiring them.</P>
<P>DID no injury ari&s;e to the public by this apo&s;tacy of the Qua|kers from them&s;elves, the public would have nothing to do with it; but as both the de&s;ign and con&s;equences are pointed again&s;t
<PB N="50" REF="015494_0026_0F998678D00CE6E8">
a cau&s;e in which the whole community are intere&s;ted, it is there|fore no longer a &s;ubject confined to the cognizance of the meet|ing only, but comes as a matter of criminality before either the authority of the particular State <HI>in which</HI> it is acted, or of the Continent <HI>again&s;t which</HI> it operates. Every attempt now to &s;up|port the authority of the king or parliament of Great-Britain over America, is trea&s;on again&s;t <HI>every</HI> State; therefore it is im|po&s;&s;ible that any <HI>one</HI> can pardon or &s;creen from puni&s;hment an offender again&s;t <HI>all.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to proceed: While the infatuated Tories of this and other States were la&s;t &s;pring talking of Commi&s;&s;ioners, accommodation, making the matter up and the Lord knows what &s;tuff and non&s;en&s;e, their <HI>good</HI> king and mini&s;try were glutting them&s;elves with the re|venge of reducing America to an <HI>unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and &s;o|lacing each other with the certainty of conquering it in <HI>one cam|paign.</HI> The following quotations are from the Parliamentary Re|gi&s;ter of the debates of the Hou&s;e of Lords, March 5th, 1776.</P>
<P>"The Americans," &s;ays Lord <HI>Talbot</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Steward of the king's hou&s;hold.</NOTE>, <Q>have been ob&s;tinate, undutiful and ungovernable from the very beginning, from their fir&s;t early and infant &s;ettlements; and I am every day more and more convinced that this people will never be brought back to their duty, and the &s;ubordinate relation they &s;tand in to this country, till <HI>reduced to an unconditional effectual &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion; no conce&s;&s;ion on our part, no lenity, no endurance,</HI> will have any other effect but that of encrea&s;ing their in&s;olence.</Q></P>
<P>"THE &s;truggle," &s;ays Lord <HI>Town&s;end</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Formerly General Town&s;end at Quebec, and late Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.</NOTE>, <Q>is now a &s;truggle for power; the die is ca&s;t, and the ONLY POINT which now re|mains to be determined, is, in what manner the war can be mo&s;t effectually pro&s;ecuted and &s;peedily fini&s;hed, in order to procure that <HI>unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,</HI> which has been &s;o ably &s;tated by the noble Earl with the white &s;taff</Q> (meaning Lord Tal|bot); <Q>and I have no rea&s;on to doubt that the mea&s;ures now pur&s;uing will put an end to the war in the cour&s;e of a SINGLE CAMPAIGN.</Q> <Q>Should it linger longer, we &s;hall then have rea&s;on to expect that &s;ome foreign power will interfere, and take advantage of our dome&s;tic troubles and civil di&s;tractions.</Q></P>
<P>LORD <HI>Littleton,</HI> <Q>My &s;entiments are pretty well known. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve now, that lenient mea&s;ures have had no other effect than to produce in&s;ult after in&s;ult; that the more we conceded, the higher America ro&s;e in her demands, and the more in&s;olent &s;he has grown. It is for this rea&s;on that I am
<PB N="51" REF="015494_0027_0F998679EEAAD6A0">
now for the mo&s;t effective and deci&s;ive mea&s;ures; and am of opinion, that no alternative is left us, but to relinqui&s;h Ame|rica for ever, or finally determine to compel her to acknow|ledge the legi&s;lative authority of this country; and it is the prin|ciple of an <HI>unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion</HI> I would be for maintaining.</Q></P>
<P>CAN words be more expre&s;&s;ive than the&s;e? Surely the Tories will believe the Tory Lords! The truth is, they <HI>do believe them,</HI> and know as fully as any Whig on the Continent knows, that the king and mini&s;try never had the lea&s;t de&s;ign of an accommodation with America, but an ab&s;olute unconditional conque&s;t. And the part which the Tories were to act, was, by downright lying, to endea|vour to put the Continent off its guard, and to divide and &s;ow di&s;|content in the minds of &s;uch Whigs as they might gain an influence over. In &s;hort, to keep up a di&s;traction here, that the force &s;ent from England might be able to conquer in <HI>"one campaign."</HI> They and the mini&s;try were, by a different game, playing into each other's hands. The cry of the Tories in England was, <HI>"No re|conciliation, no accommodation,"</HI> in order to obtain the greater mi|litary force; while tho&s;e in America were crying nothing but <HI>"reconciliation and accommodation,"</HI> that the force &s;ent might con|quer with the le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>this "&s;ingle campaign"</HI> is over, and America not conquered. The whole work is yet to do, and the force much le&s;s to do it with. Their condition is both de&s;picable and deplorable: Out of ca&s;h&mdash;out of heart&mdash;and out of hope. A country furni&s;hed with arms and ammunition, as America now is, with three millions of inha|bitants, and three thou&s;and miles di&s;tant from the neare&s;t enemy that can approach her, is able to look and laugh them in the face.</P>
<P>HOWE appears to have two objects in view, either to go up the North river, or come to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>BY going up the North river, he &s;ecures a retreat for his army thro' Canada, but the &s;hips mu&s;t return, if they return at all, the &s;ame way they went; and as our army would be in the rear, the &s;afety of their pa&s;&s;age down is a doubtful matter. By &s;uch a motion he &s;huts him&s;elf from all &s;upplies from Europe but thro' Canada, and expo&s;es his army and navy to the danger of peri&s;hing. The idea of his cutting off the communication between the ea&s;tern and &s;outhern States, by means of the North river, is merely vi&s;ionary. He cannot do it by his &s;hipping; becau&s;e no &s;hip can lay long at anchor in any river within reach of the &s;hore; a &s;ingle gun would drive a fir&s;t rate from &s;uch a &s;tation: This was fully proved
<PB N="52" REF="015494_0028_0F99867A29C33538">
la&s;t October at fort Wa&s;hington and Lee, where one gun only, on each &s;ide the river, obliged two frigates to cut and be towed off in an hour's time. Neither can he cut it off by his army; be|cau&s;e the &s;everal po&s;ts they mu&s;t occupy, would divide them almo&s;t to nothing, and expo&s;e them to be picked up by ours like pebbles on a river's bank; but admitting he could, where is the injury? Becau&s;e while his whole force is cantoned out, as centries over the water, they will be very innocently employed, and the mo|ment they march into the country, the communication opens.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t probable object is Philadelphia, and the rea&s;ons are many. Howe's bu&s;ine&s;s in America is to conquer it, and in pro|portion as he finds him&s;elf unable to the ta&s;k, he will employ his &s;trength to di&s;tre&s;s women and weak minds, in order to accompli&s;h through <HI>their</HI> fears what he cannot effect by his <HI>own</HI> force. His coming or attempting to come to Philadelphia is a circum&s;tance that proves his weakne&s;s: For no general, that felt him&s;elf able to take the field and attack his antagoni&s;t, would think of bringing his army into a city in the &s;ummer time; and this mere &s;hifting the &s;cene from place to place, without effecting any thing, has feeblene&s;s and cowardice on the face of it, and holds him up in a con|temptible light to any one who can rea&s;on ju&s;tly and firmly. By &s;everal informations from New-York, it appears that their army in general, both officers and men, have given up the ex|pectation of conquering America; their eye, now, is fixt upon the &s;poil. They &s;uppo&s;e Philadelphia to be rich with &s;tores, and as they think to get more by robbing a town than by attacking an army, their movement towards this city is probable. We are not now contending again&s;t an army of &s;oldiers, but again&s;t a band of thieves, who had rather plunder than &s;ight, and have no other hope of conque&s;t than by cluelty.</P>
<P>THEY expect to get a mighty booty and &s;trike another general panic by making a &s;udden movement and getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion this city, but unle&s;s they can march <HI>out</HI> as well as <HI>in,</HI> or get the entire command of the river, to remove off their plunder, they may probably be &s;topt with the &s;tolen goods upon them. They have never yet &s;ucceeded wherever they have been oppo&s;ed but at fort Wa&s;hington. At Charlestown their defeat was effectual. At Ticonderoga they ran away. In every &s;kirmi&s;h at King&s;bridge and the White Plains they were obliged to retreat, and the in&s;tant our arms were turned upon them in the Jer&s;ies, they turned like|wi&s;e, and tho&s;e that turned not were taken.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of always fitting our internal police to the cir|cum&s;tances of the times we live in, is &s;omething &s;o &s;trikingly ob|vious
<PB N="53" REF="015494_0029_0F99867B41339248">
that no &s;ufficient objection can be made again&s;t it. The &s;afety of all &s;ocieties depend upon it; and where this point is not attended to, the con&s;equence will either be a general languor or a tumult. The encouragement and protection of the good &s;ubjects of any State, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion and puni&s;hment of bad ones, are the principal objects for which all authority is in&s;tituted, and the line in which it ought to operate. We have in this city a &s;trange variety of men and characters, and the circum&s;tances of the times require they &s;hould be publicly known; it is not the number of Tories that hurt us, &s;o much, as the not finding out who they are; men mu&s;t now take one &s;ide or the other, and abide by the con|&s;equences: The Quakers, tru&s;ting to their &s;hort &s;ighted &s;agacity, have, mo&s;t unluckily for them, made their declaration in their la&s;t te&s;timony, and we ought <HI>now</HI> to take them at their word. They have voluntarily read them&s;elves out of the Continental meeting, and cannot hope to be re&s;tored to it again, but by payment and penitence. Men who&s;e political principles are founded on avarice, are beyond the reach of rea&s;on, and the only cure for Toryi&s;m of this ca&s;t, is to tax it. A &s;ub&s;tantial good drawn from a real evil, is of the &s;ame benefit to &s;ociety, as if drawn from a virtue; and where men have not public &s;pirit to render them&s;elves &s;ervice|able, it ought to be the &s;tudy of government to draw the be&s;t u&s;e po&s;&s;ible from their vices. When the governing pa&s;&s;ion of any man or &s;et of men is once known, the method of managing them is ea&s;y; for even mi&s;ers, whom no public virtue can impre&s;s, would become generous, could a heavy tax be laid upon covetou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Tories have endeavoured to in&s;ure their property with the enemy, by forfeiting their reputation with us; from which may be ju&s;tly inferred, that their governing pa&s;&s;ion is avarice. Make them as much afraid of lo&s;ing on one &s;ide as the other, and you &s;tagger their Toryi&s;m; make them more &s;o, and you reclaim them; for their principle is to wor&s;hip any power they are mo&s;t afraid of.</P>
<P>THIS method of con&s;idering men and things together, opens into a large field for &s;peculation, and affords me opportunity of offering &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the &s;tate of our currency, &s;o as to make the &s;upport of it go hand in hand, with the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of di&s;affection and the encouragement of public &s;pirit.</P>
<P>THE thing which fir&s;t pre&s;ents it&s;elf in in&s;pecting the &s;tate of the currency, is, that we have too much of it, and that there is a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of reducing the quantity, in order to encrea&s;e the value. Men are daily growing poor by the very means they take to get rich, for in the &s;ame proportion that the prices of all goods on

hand are rai&s;ed, the value of all money laid by is reduced. A &s;imple ca&s;e will make this clear: Let a man have one hundred pounds ca&s;h, and as many goods on hand as will to-day &s;ell for &pound; 20, but not content with the pre&s;ent market-price, he rai&s;es them to 40, and by &s;o doing, obliges others in their own defence to rai&s;e cent per cent likewi&s;e; in this ca&s;e, it is evident that his hundred pound laid by is reduced fifty pounds in value; where|as, had the markets dropt cent per cent, his goods would have &s;old but for ten, but his hundred pounds would have ri&s;en in va|lue to two hundred; becau&s;e it would then purcha&s;e as many goods again, or &s;upport his family as long again as before. And &s;trange as it may &s;eem, he is one hundred and fifty pounds the poorer for rai&s;ing his goods, to what he would have been had he lowered them; becau&s;e the forty pounds his goods &s;old for, is by the general ri&s;e of the markets, cent per cent, rendered of no more value than the ten pounds would be had the market fallen in the &s;ame proportion; and con&s;equently the whole difference of gain or lo&s;s is on the different values of the hundred pounds laid by, viz. from fifty to two hundred. This rage for rai&s;ing goods is for &s;everal rea&s;ons much more the fault of the Tories than the Whigs; and yet the Tories (to their &s;hame and confu&s;ion ought they to be told of it) are by far the mo&s;t noi&s;y and di&s;contented. The greate&s;t part of the Whigs, by being now either in the army or employed in &s;ome public &s;ervice, are <HI>buyers</HI> only and not <HI>&s;ellers,</HI> and as this evil has its origin in trade, it cannot be charged on tho&s;e who are out of it.</P>
<P>BUT the grievance is now become too general to be remedied by partial methods, and the only effectual cure is to reduce the quan|tity of money; with half the quantity we &s;hould be richer than we are now, becau&s;e the value of it would be doubled, and con|&s;equently our attachment to it increa&s;ed; for it is not the number of dollars a man has, but how far they will go, that makes him either rich or poor.</P>
<P>THESE two points being admitted, viz, that the quantity of money is too great, and that the prices of goods can be only ef|fectually reduced by reducing the quantity of the money, the next point to be con&s;idered is, The method how to reduce it?</P>
<P>THE circum&s;tances of the times, as before ob&s;erved, require that the public characters of all men &s;hould <HI>now</HI> be fully under|&s;tood, and the only general method of a&s;certaining it is by an oath or affirmation, renouncing all allegiance to the king of Great-Britain, and to &s;upport the Independency of the United States as declared by Congre&s;s. Let, at the &s;ame time, a tax of
<PB N="55" REF="015494_0031_0F99867C635B0680">
ten, fifteen or twenty per cent per annum, to be collected quar|terly, be levied on all property. The&s;e alternatives, by being per|fectly voluntary, will take in all &s;orts of people. Here is the te&s;t; here is the tax. He who takes the former, con&s;cientiou&s;ly proves his affection to the cau&s;e, and binds him&s;elf to pay his quota by the be&s;t <HI>&s;ervices</HI> in his power, and is thereby ju&s;tly exempt from the latter; and tho&s;e who chu&s;e the latter, pay their quota in money, to be excu&s;ed from taking the former, or rather 'tis the price paid to us for their &s;uppo&s;ed, though mi&s;taken, in&s;urance with the enemy.</P>
<P>BUT this is only a part of the advantage which would ari&s;e by knowing the different characters of men. The Whigs &s;take every thing on the i&s;&s;ue of their arms, while the Tories, by their di&s;affection, are &s;apping and undermining their &s;trength, and, of con&s;equence, the property of the Whigs is the more expo&s;ed thereby; and whatever injury their e&s;tates may &s;u&s;tain by the movements of the enemy, mu&s;t either be borne by them&s;elves, who have done every thing which have <HI>yet</HI> been done, or by the Tories, who have not only done nothing, but have by their di&s;|affection, invited the enemy on.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent cri&s;is we ought to know &s;quare by &s;quare, and hou&s;e by hou&s;e, who are in real allegiance with the United In|dependent States, and who are not. Let but the line be made clear and di&s;tinct, and all men will then know what they are to tru&s;t to. It would not only be good policy, but &s;trict ju&s;tice, to rai&s;e fifty or an hundred thou&s;and pounds, or more, if it is nece&s;|&s;ary, out of the e&s;tates and property of the king of England's vo|taries, re&s;ident in Philadelphia, to be di&s;tributed, as a reward to tho&s;e inhabitants of the city and State, who &s;hould turn out and repul&s;e the enemy, &s;hould they attempt their march this way; and likewi&s;e, to bind the property of all &s;uch per&s;ons to make good the damages which that of the Whigs might &s;u&s;tain. In the un|di&s;tingui&s;hable mode of conducting a war, we frequently make repri&s;als at &s;ea, on the ve&s;&s;els of per&s;ons in England who are friends to our cau&s;e compared with the re&s;identiary Tories among us.</P>
<P>IN every former publication of mine, from Common Sen&s;e down to the la&s;t Cri&s;is, I have generally gone on the charitable &s;uppo&s;ition, that the Tories were rather a mi&s;taken than a crimi|nal people, and have applied argument after argument with all the candour and temper I was capable of, in order to &s;et every part of the ca&s;e clearly and fairly before them, and if po&s;&s;ible to reclaim them from ruin to rea&s;on. I have done my duty by them
<PB N="56" REF="015494_0032_0F99867D2355AF50">
and have now done with that doctrine, taking it for granted, that tho&s;e who yet hold their di&s;affection, are, either a &s;et of avari|cious mi&s;creants, who would &s;acrifice the Continent to &s;ave them|&s;elves, or a banditti of hungry traitors, who are hoping for a di|vi&s;ion of the &s;poil. To which may be added, a li&s;t of Crown or Proprietary dependents, who, rather than go without a portion of power, would be content to &s;hare it with the devil. Of &s;uch men there is no hope; and their obedience will only be according to the danger that is &s;et before them, and the power that is exerci&s;ed over them.</P>
<P>A time will &s;hortly arrive, in which, by a&s;certaining the cha|racters of per&s;ons now, we &s;hall be guarded again&s;t their mi&s;chiefs then; for in proportion as the enemy de&s;pair of conque&s;t, they will be trying the arts of &s;eduction and the force of fear by all the mi&s;chiefs they can inflict. But in war we may be certain of the&s;e two things, viz. that cruelty in an enemy, and motions made with more than u&s;ual parade, are always &s;igns of weakne&s;s. He that can conquer, finds his mind too free and plea&s;ant to be bruti&s;h; and he that intends to conquer, never makes too much &s;how of his &s;trength.</P>
<P>WE now know the enemy we have to do with. While drunk with the certainty of victory they di&s;dained to be civil; and in proportion as di&s;appointment makes them &s;ober, and their apprehen&s;ions of the European war alarm them, they will become cringing and artful; hone&s;t they cannot be. But our an&s;wer to them, in either condition they may be in, is &s;hort and full, <Q>As Free and Independent States we are willing to make peace with you to-morrow, but we can neither hear nor reply in any other character.</Q></P>
<P>IF Britain cannot conquer us, it proves, that &s;he is neither able to govern or protect us, and our particular &s;ituation now is &s;uch, that any connection with her would be unwi&s;ely exchanging a half defeated enemy for two powerful ones. Europe, by every ap|pearance and information, is now on the eve, nay, on the morn|ing twilight of a war, and any alliance with <HI>George the Third</HI> brings <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> upon our backs; a &s;eparation from him attach them to our &s;ide; therefore, the only road to <HI>Peace, Honour</HI> and <HI>Commerce</HI> is INDEPENDENCE.</P>
