<HEAD>A Recommendation, From the United Pa&s;tors in <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>TO Spiritualize the common Actions of Life, and make a religious Improvement of world|ly Affairs, is an</HI> holy <HI>and</HI> happy Art: <HI>A</HI> Walk with God <HI>very much lies in</HI> this, <HI>and is greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by it: This is a part of that</HI> Spiritual|mindedne&s;s <HI>which is</HI> Life <HI>and</HI> Peace. <HI>Were Chri&s;tians better skill'd in this, their worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s might be a</HI> Help, <HI>rather than a Hin|drance to them in their way to Heaven. Now no worldly Calling is more capable of a &s;piritual Improvement than that of the</HI> Husbandman: <HI>And as it is a Calling which nece&s;&s;arily takes up &s;o great a part of the Sons of Men, to teach them the</HI> &s;piritual U&s;e <HI>of it mu&s;t needs be a noble and ble&s;&s;ed De&s;ign. This is the De&s;ign of the pre&s;ent</HI> Tract; <HI>wherein the main Intentions of</HI> PIETY <HI>are &s;erv'd with an excellent Accommodation, in the Bu&s;ine&s;s and Language of</HI> Husbandry. <HI>So our Saviour fetch'd &s;everal of the</HI> Parables <HI>where|in he in&s;tructed his Auditors, from the</HI> Calling of the Husbandman. <HI>And tis to be hop'd &s;uch a Book as this, (which in&s;tructs the Husbandman how to</HI> dre&s;s his Soul, <HI>while he</HI> dre&s;&s;es his Ground, <HI>and to make &s;ure of his being receiv'd to a</HI> Crown <HI>in Heaven, when he is taken from the</HI> Plow <HI>on Earth) will meet with a</HI> general Acceptance <HI>in a Country the Bu&s;ine&s;s of which is mo&s;tly</HI> Husbandry, <HI>and which has been famous for</HI> religious Husbandmen.</P>
<P><PB REF="002905_0004_0FE6912CF2FDE0F8">
<HI>Indeed this De&s;ign has been excellently &s;erv'd in the Labours of tho&s;e Servants of GOD,</HI> Flavel <HI>and</HI> Steel: <HI>But their</HI> Treati&s;es <HI>are not common among</HI> us: <HI>Neither is it to be &s;uppos'd that they have gather'd in</HI> all the Sheaves <HI>of this plenti|ful Harve&s;t.

<P>A Call from <HI>Heaven,</HI> which every Man upon <HI>Earth</HI> is deeply concerned in. It is introduced &s;o, <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord unto the Man,</HI> in the &s;ingular Number; Be|cau&s;e every &s;ingle <HI>Man</HI> is to look on him&s;elf as ad|dre&s;&s;ed in it. Unto every <HI>Man</HI> whatever, it may now be &s;aid, <HI>O Earth, Earth, Earth, Hear the Word of the Lord.</HI> There is a <HI>Plow</HI> ordered for thee; a <HI>Plow,</HI> the penetrations whereof thou mu&s;t &s;ubmit unto.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002905_0007_0FE691A017F50A98">
When the Illu&s;trious and Immortal Prophet <HI>Elijah</HI> pa&s;&s;ed by One at the <HI>Plow,</HI> for whom GOD intended uncommon Favours, the Prophet put up|on him the <HI>Melota,</HI> which he wore upon his <HI>Head;</HI> and Lo, the <HI>Influences of Heaven</HI> accompanied it, &s;o that he left the <HI>Plow,</HI> and he could let nothing hinder his becoming a <HI>Man of GOD,</HI> and a fol|lower of the be&s;t Man in the world.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, to be at the <HI>Plow,</HI> is to be where the <HI>Influences of Heaven</HI> may find us. Oh! That what pa&s;&s;es from the <HI>Head</HI> of the <HI>Speaker</HI> may be accom|companied with <HI>Influences of Heaven</HI> on the <HI>Heart</HI> of the <HI>Hearer.</HI> But what? <HI>Leave the Plow,</HI> upon it! GOD forbid. The Sermon, may find us at the <HI>Plow;</HI> But whether &s;o or no, the de&s;ign of the Sermon will be, to bring us all to the <HI>Plow,</HI> yea, to keep us at it all our Days.</P>
<P>The Glorious GOD calls a &s;inful People to REPENTANCE: REPENTANCE, without which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible a Sinner &s;hould be prepared for the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings of Goodne&s;s.</HI> Of this <HI>Repentance,</HI> we have a notable De&s;cription, in that very Ex|pre&s;&s;ive and In&s;tructive Metaphor; <HI>Break up your fallow Ground.</HI> Now, certainly tis the <HI>Plow</HI> in its <HI>Work,</HI> that is thus to <HI>Break up the fallow Ground.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Plow,</HI> that grand In&s;trument of <HI>Husbandry;</HI> which we may celebrate, as, <HI>The Ancient,</HI> and, <HI>The Honourable! The &s;taff of Bread</HI> mu&s;t &s;ail us, and we mu&s;t &s;oon fall down into the <HI>Earth,</HI> if the <HI>Plow</HI> wherewith we &s;ollicit the <HI>Earth</HI> for our <HI>Bread,</HI> were <HI>taken away.</HI> Doubele&s;s, its Antiquity is higher than the Days of <HI>Tubal-Cain.</HI> And how much it Rivals the very <HI>Seeptre</HI> may be pondered, when we re|member; <HI>The profit of the Earth is for all; the King him&s;elf is al&s;o &s;erved by the Field.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002905_0008_0FE691A292927C70">
The <HI>Plow</HI> which is now called for, is, That which brings a <HI>Repenting Sinner,</HI> to what we mu&s;t all come to, that we may find mercy with GOD. The <HI>Breaking up of the fallow Ground,</HI> with the <HI>Plow, is,</HI> The bringing of the Sinner to that <HI>Repentance,</HI> which is nece&s;&s;ary for him.</P>
<P>And the DOCTRINE of GOD our SAVI|OUR, the <HI>entrance</HI> of which now to <HI>give light unto</HI> us is This.</P>
<P>'Tis in the way of REPENTING, that they who have <HI>&s;inned,</HI> may look to be &s;aved from the evil Effects of their <HI>Sin;</HI> And there mu&s;t be &s;een <HI>the PLOW breaking up our Fallow Ground,</HI> in this REPENTANCE.</P>
<P>In the &s;acred <HI>Prophecies,</HI> with which the <HI>Scrip|ture of Truth</HI> has been, as a <HI>Light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ning in a Dark plnce</HI> unto us, the Times that are to be <HI>longed</HI> for, [The <HI>Souls under the Altar</HI> cry out, for them, <HI>How long!</HI>] even the Times, when the <HI>promi&s;ed King|dom of GOD</HI> &s;hall arrive, and the <HI>Times</HI> which <HI>ac|cording to his Promi&s;e we look for;</HI> This is given as the Character of them; I&s;a. II. 4. <HI>They &s;hall beat their Swords into Plow-&s;hares.</HI> My Brethren, There will be a praelibation of tho&s;e glorious Times in it, if the <HI>Plow-&s;hares</HI> may now &s;o come into their ope|ration, as to <HI>break up our fallow Ground,</HI> and pro|duce the <HI>Repentance</HI> in us, which will never be <HI>Re|pented</HI> of.</P>
<P>In the Pro&s;ecution of this Intention, let us En|quire, fir&s;t; What is the <HI>fallow Ground,</HI> which in the work of <HI>Repentance</HI> requires the <HI>Plow</HI> to be em|ploy'd upon it?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002905_0009_0FE691A2AF169C78">
Verily, 'Tis the <HI>Heart</HI> of Man. O Man, 'tis thy <HI>Heart,</HI> and my <HI>Heart,</HI> that is the <HI>fallow Ground.</HI> Whenever thou &s;ee&s;t any <HI>Ground</HI> lying <HI>fallow,</HI> thou may&s;t &s;ay. <HI>I now &s;ee a Soyl which my &s;inful Heart may be &s;adly compar'd unto.</HI> And, Oh! what will become of us, if the <HI>Plow-&s;hare</HI> of <HI>Repentance</HI> do not go deep into it!</P>
<P>REPENTANCE will bring us to make the&s;e Acknowledgments; and we &s;hall make them with the bitterne&s;s of <HI>Wormwood</HI> and of <HI>Gall,</HI> and with a <HI>Soul humbled in us.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t; A <HI>Repenting</HI> Sinner will acknowledge This; <HI>My Heart is a very barren Soyl. Fallow Ground</HI> has growing upon it, none of tho&s;e <HI>good things</HI> which we &s;et a value on. It has enough of tho&s;e things which are <HI>good for nothing,</HI> or, perhaps wor&s;e than &s;o. Our <HI>Heart</HI> is this <HI>fallow Ground.</HI> It is an <HI>Heart</HI> that is de&s;titute of good Principles; and good <HI>Ends,</HI> and good <HI>Frames,</HI> and good <HI>Thoughts,</HI> are not now the <HI>natural Growth</HI> of the Soyl. Our Nature being wofully corrupted by our fall from GOD, our complaint mu&s;t be That; Rom. VII. 18. <HI>I know, that in me, (that is, in my Fle&s;h,) there dwelleth no good thing. O Wretched Heart that thou art;</HI> How empty of all that is <HI>Good!</HI> It mu&s;t come from an Hand which takes <HI>pains</HI> for thy <HI>good,</HI> if any <HI>good</HI> be found in thee. But for the Rever&s;e thereof, enough of <HI>that!</HI> The <HI>Thorns</HI> &amp; the <HI>Thi&s;tles</HI> of the <HI>cur&s;ed Ground</HI> are not &s;uch unhappy things as what our <HI>Heart</HI> is over grown withal. What <HI>natural|ly grows</HI> in our <HI>Heart,</HI> &amp; appears without our taking any <HI>pains</HI> to bring it forward, is, what will be yield|ed, by an <HI>Heart fully &s;et in us to do evil.</HI> What can be imagined, but what is <HI>Evil</HI> enough in an <HI>Heart,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="002905_0010_0FE691A9A2E97C18">whereof every Imagination is <HI>Evil continually?</HI> What will be the <HI>growth</HI> of a <HI>carnal Mind</HI> that is full of <HI>Enmity again&s;t GOD;</HI> and of an <HI>Heart,</HI> that is <HI>de&s;perately wicked?</HI> The <HI>growth</HI> of &s;uch a <HI>Soyl</HI> has been told us, by Him who <HI>&s;earches the Heart;</HI> Mat.

<P>Secondly; A Repenting Sinner will acknow|ledge This; <HI>My Heart is a very harden'd Soyl. Fal|low Ground</HI> is become <HI>hard;</HI> by lying long undi&s;|turbed, its parts come to &s;tick very clo&s;e to one another. Perhaps, 'tis the more <HI>hard</HI> for being often trod upon. Our <HI>Heart</HI> is this <HI>fallow Ground.</HI> The <HI>Truths</HI> of GOD which are the <HI>Seeds of Life,</HI> the <HI>Rays</HI> that are &s;hot from the <HI>Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> the <HI>Doctrine</HI> which <HI>drops as the Rain,</HI> will not enter into &s;o tough a Soyl. Our <HI>Heart</HI> will re&s;i&s;t all good Admonitions; and <HI>E&s;&s;ays to do good,</HI> &s;ignify nothing, becau&s;e of what we read of; Rom. II. 5. <HI>Thy hardne&s;s and impenitent Heart.</HI> Our <HI>Heart</HI> will remain as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad as it was; and will receive no Be|nefit from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>means of good,</HI> that are u&s;ed upon us. It has been &s;o long under the Feet of <HI>Satan,</HI> that now it will deny entrance to all that is good: No Coun&s;els, no Warnings, nothing at all, will <HI>enter into the Fool.</HI> In a <HI>Turn</HI> to GOD, this is u&s;ually one of the fir&s;t things, that is complained of: <HI>An hard Heart! An hard Heart! An Heart which there is no moving of!</HI> That moan is heard; I&s;a LXIII. 17. <HI>Our Heart hardened from thy Fear.</HI> Oh!

<P><PB N="6" REF="002905_0011_0FE691A9C224EF58">
Let us Enquire, Secondly; What are tho&s;e ope|rations of <HI>Repentance,</HI> in which the <HI>Plow</HI> is to <HI>break up</HI> this <HI>fallow Ground?</HI></P>
<P>You take it for granted, The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, accompanied with the Influences of the Holy SPIRIT, is the <HI>Plow</HI> with which this work of GOD is carried on. And now,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t; In a true <HI>Repentance,</HI> the <HI>Heart</HI> is <HI>broken,</HI> with a <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> and <HI>grief</HI> of the <HI>Sins,</HI> which the great GOD has been offended at. There is a <HI>compuncti|on</HI> of the <HI>Heart,</HI> and a <HI>contrition</HI> of the <HI>Heart,</HI> in that <HI>Repentance,</HI> which therefore, O Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, thou art &s;o lothe to come unto, Of <HI>Penitents</HI> we read, Act. II. 37. <HI>They are pierced in their Heart.</HI> And of <HI>Penitents</HI> we read, P&s;al. XXXIV. 18. <HI>The Lord is nigh to them that are of a broken Heart, and &s;aveth &s;uch as be of a contrite Spirit.</HI> We are advi&s;ed; <HI>By &s;orrow of Heart, the Spirit is broken.</HI> The <HI>Earth</HI> is not more <HI>broken</HI> by the <HI>Plow</HI> tearing of it, than the <HI>Heart</HI> of a <HI>Repenting</HI> one, is <HI>broken</HI> with the <HI>&s;orrow</HI> of <HI>Repen|tance.</HI> There is a <HI>godly &s;orrow working of</HI> and in <HI>Repentance.</HI> The <HI>Repenting</HI> one makes a <HI>&s;orrowful Reflection,</HI> on what he has done in &s;inning again&s;t the glorious GOD. With an <HI>Heart-breaking</HI> Re|gret, and Remor&s;e, and <HI>&s;orrow,</HI> he thinks;
<Q><HI>I have &s;inned, and I have done very fooli&s;hly.</HI> But, Oh! What have I done, when I have &s;inned! I have <HI>deny'd the GOD that is above,</HI> and &s;et my &s;elf and my <HI>Idols above</HI> him. I have trampled on the <HI>Au|thority</HI> of my <HI>Maker;</HI> defied his <HI>Power,</HI> derided his <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> de&s;pi&s;ed his <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> di&s;puted his <HI>Faithfulne&s;s;</HI> and oppo&s;ed his <HI>Holine&s;s.</HI> I have &s;lighted the SON of GOD, and &s;corned all his gracious <HI>Tenders.</HI> I have vexed the SPIRIT of
<PB N="7" REF="002905_0012_0FE691AB465F2A20">GOD, and &s;tifled all his gracious <HI>Motions.</HI> I have di&s;obliged the <HI>Angels,</HI> and gratified the <HI>De|vils.</HI> I have <HI>wronged</HI> my own Soul, and <HI>ruin'd</HI> all my Intere&s;ts. I have refu&s;ed <HI>eternal Plea&s;ures,</HI> and incurr'd <HI>eternal Torments;</HI> all for a meer <HI>&s;ha|dow</HI> of a <HI>delight,</HI> which is but for a Moment. Oh! What <HI>madne&s;s</HI> has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me!</Q> Such &s;entiments as the&s;e enter with the wounding force of a <HI>Plow-&s;hare</HI> into the <HI>Heart</HI> of a <HI>Repenting</HI> one. He feels that angui&s;h from them, that makes him cry out, <HI>My Heart is broken, O GOD, my Heart is broken. My wounded Spirit; Oh! I cannot bear it!</HI> This, O thou that ha&s;t <HI>gone on in thy Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es,</HI> This is what the <HI>Plow</HI> mu&s;t bring thee to; P&s;al LI. 17. <HI>The Sacrifices of GOD, a broken Spirit; a broken and a contrite Heart.</HI> And let not this be forgotten; One con&s;picuous and perpetual <HI>mark</HI> of the <HI>broken Heart,</HI> will be This; The <HI>Heart</HI> is, like the <HI>Earth</HI> yielding to the <HI>Plow</HI> and what follows upon it, made willing to comply with the <HI>whole Will</HI> of GOD: Willing to come into whatever <HI>&s;hape</HI> GOD would have it brought into; willing to be any thing, do any thing, take any thing, that GOD &s;hall order for it. The <HI>Repenting</HI> one, lyes at the Foot of the glorious GOD, and &s;ays, <HI>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. In a true <HI>Repentance,</HI> the <HI>Heart</HI> is left no longer under the <HI>Dominion</HI> of the <HI>Lu&s;ts,</HI> that were the <HI>Weeds</HI> of the Soul. There is the <HI>Lu&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>Lu&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Eye,</HI> and the <HI>Pride of Life,</HI> which engro&s;s the Soul, and bind the powers of it fa&s;t, in oppo&s;ition unto GOD. The&s;e <HI>Weeds</HI> which cover the face of the Earth, in our <HI>Heart,</HI> and hinder our being filled with the <HI>Fruits of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002905_0013_0FE691AB64294748">are extirpated in that <HI>Repentance</HI> which brings us unto GOD. What the <HI>Penitent</HI> comes to is that; Rom. VI. 16. <HI>Sin &s;hall not have Dominion over you. Penitents</HI> have the experience of &s;uch a Deliverance, as that; P&s;al. CXVI. 16. <HI>Truly, O Lord, I am thy Servant, I am thy Servant; Thou ha&s;t loo&s;ed my Bonds.</HI> The <HI>de&s;ires of the Fle&s;h and of the Mind,</HI> and the <HI>diver&s;e Lu&s;ts,</HI> which are the <HI>Root of bitterne&s;s</HI> in the Soul, the intention of <HI>Repentance</HI> is to di&s;turb them; and anon the <HI>Heart</HI> of the <HI>Repent|ing</HI> one becomes di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them. The&s;e poi|&s;onous <HI>Weeds of Death</HI> are di&s;turbed, yea, they are de&s;troyed by the <HI>Plow,</HI> in the <HI>Heart</HI> of &s;uch as are by <HI>Repentance</HI> brought home unto GOD. No <HI>Lu&s;t</HI> can live quietly in a <HI>Repenting</HI> Soul. Every <HI>Lu&s;t</HI> comes under a <HI>Mortification</HI> in the <HI>Heart</HI> of &s;uch an one.

<P>I have done. The <HI>Plow</HI> has done its Work, and the <HI>Fallow-Ground</HI> is well <HI>broken</HI> up, if the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD finds now a <HI>free pa&s;&s;age</HI> into your Hearts. And, Oh! May your Hearts be now &s;o <HI>opened,</HI> by the Lord, that in whatever <HI>Word</HI> He comes unto you, your <HI>con&s;enting Hearts</HI> may &s;ay, <HI>Welcome art thou, O Lord, and welcome is every Word of thine, unto me!</HI></P>
<P>We read of it, as a very Improper Thing; Amos V. 12. <HI>Will one plow upon a Rock?</HI> Sinful Soul, Tho' thy <HI>Heart</HI> be like a <HI>Rock,</HI> Yet, Oh! Let not the <HI>Obduration</HI> continue, and let not all the Exhortations to <HI>Repentance,</HI> be but a <HI>plowing upon a Rock.</HI> But let thy <HI>Relenting Heart,</HI> at lea&s;t come &s;o far, as to beg it of thy Exalted SAVI|OUR; <HI>O my SAVIOUR, who&s;e Office it is; Do thou give me both Repentance and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins.</HI></P>
<P>I did indeed &s;ay, <HI>I have done.</HI> But I know not how to part with my <HI>Plow-man,</HI> until I have ta|ken a little Notice of &s;omething in his Hand, by which the Creatures which draw his <HI>Plow</HI> for him, are Exagitated. He carries a GOAD in his Hand.</P>
<P>We read of a Champion, Judg. III. 31. <HI>He &s;lew &s;ix hundred Men with an Ox-Goad.</HI> We may gue&s;s a little at the &s;hape of that <HI>Ox-Goad,</HI> and how fit a Tool it was for &s;uch an Execution, from what is related by Modern Travellers concerning the <HI>Hus|bandry</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="002905_0025_0FE69133DC6472A8">in tho&s;e parts of the World. They tell us, That in <HI>plowing</HI> the <HI>Husbandmen</HI> u&s;e <HI>Goads</HI> of an extraordinary &s;ize.

<P>All that I &s;hall ob&s;erve upon it is; There are &s;o many <HI>Goads,</HI> in the <HI>lively Oracles</HI> of GOD, for our <HI>Excitation</HI> and <HI>In&s;tigation</HI> to <HI>Repentance,</HI> and a life of PIETY.

IX. 5. <HI>It is hard for thee, to kick again&s;t the Goads.</HI> Oh! do not by thy Dilatory proceedings in the <HI>Life of GOD,</HI> provoke him to multiply the <HI>unea&s;y &s;trokes</HI> of his <HI>Goads</HI> upon thee.</P>

<P>The WORD of GOD, in the Promulgation of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> is a <HI>Seed</HI> which finds in the <HI>Heart</HI> of Man a very <HI>different Soyl</HI> when it is ca&s;t up|on it; A <HI>Soyl</HI> which the <HI>Word</HI> has very <HI>vari|ous,</HI> Bad and Good Effects upon.</P>
<P>We are enriched with a GOSPEL, which is by our SAVIOUR in his explaining of his own <HI>Pa|rable,</HI> called, <HI>The Word of the Kingdom.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Word</HI> which Proclaimes a Glorious CHRIST, as the <HI>King upon the Holy Hill of Zion,</HI> who is <HI>Lord of All,</HI> and <HI>has all Power in Heaven and Earth given to him.</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Word</HI> which brings the <HI>Law</HI> of this great <HI>King</HI> unto us, and promi&s;es unto them that Follow and Obey him, the Glories of an Heavenly <HI>Kingdom,</HI> at his <HI>Appearing.</HI></P>
<P>Of this <HI>Word,</HI> whereof, O <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed People</HI> that we are, we hear the <HI>Joyful Sound,</HI> &s;ome con&s;iderable things are to be now declared unto us.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="24" REF="002905_0029_0FE691CAB6CB7358">
I. The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD falling on the Heart of Man, is like a <HI>Seed</HI> of <HI>Corn,</HI> which the Earth has from the Husbandman <HI>ca&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;own</HI> upon it.</P>
<P>You need not be told, That the Man who hears the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, and indeed every Man on the Face of the <HI>Darth,</HI> may be compared unto the <HI>Earth.</HI> You are &s;ufficiently appri&s;ed of it, That the <HI>Body</HI> of Man, came out of the <HI>Earth,</HI> and again goes into it. The devout <HI>Job,</HI> &s;itting on the <HI>Earth,</HI> call'd it, His <HI>Mother;</HI> And &s;itting in his <HI>Mothers</HI> Lap, he confe&s;&s;ed; Job I. 21. <HI>Naked came I out of my Moehers Womb, and naked &s;hall I re|turn thither.</HI> This <HI>Mother</HI> of Man, may well be allow'd a <HI>Figure</HI> of Man. Let it not offend thee, <HI>O proud Man,</HI> if the Term of, <HI>A Clod of Earth,</HI> be put upon thee.</P>
<P>But what I am to tell you, is, On what Ac|counts, the <HI>Seed</HI> of <HI>Corn</HI> (or of any <HI>Plant</HI>) re&s;embles the <HI>Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel,</HI> that is preached unto them, who <HI>dwell on the Earth.</HI> The Accounts are ma|ny.</P>
<P>Is there a &s;ort of <HI>Life</HI> in the <HI>Seed</HI> of a <HI>Plant?</HI> Our SAVIOUR, the <HI>Prince of Life,</HI> has told ns; Joh. VI. 63. <HI>The Words that I &s;peak unto you, they are Spirit and they are Life.</HI> O the fair and &s;weet Things, which pullulate from the&s;e <HI>Lively Oracles!</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Seed</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>&s;own,</HI> or the <HI>Fruit</HI> will be none: If it be kept in the <HI>Granary,</HI> it will never <HI>Fructify.</HI> It is the <HI>&s;peaking</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> that is the ca&s;ting of the <HI>Seed.</HI> We read, 1 The&s;&s;. II. 16. It mu&s;t be <HI>&s;poken</HI> to Men, that they may be <HI>&s;aved.</HI> There is ordinarily no <HI>&s;aving</HI> the Souls of Men, but in the way of the <HI>In&s;titution,</HI> the <HI>&s;peaking</HI> and
<PB N="25" REF="002905_0030_0FE6913407AC8DC8"><HI>preaching</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> unto them. They that are not in the way of it, are not in the ordinary way to be <HI>&s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Seed</HI> brings forth a <HI>Grain</HI> like it &s;elf; The <HI>Fruit</HI> is <HI>after its kind.</HI> What the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD produces, is what is <HI>agreeable</HI> to the <HI>Word.</HI> It is a <HI>Good Word;</HI> and it will <HI>do</HI> us this <HI>Good,</HI> it will make us <HI>Good;</HI> and make us love to <HI>do Good.</HI> It is a <HI>clean Word,</HI> and it will make us to <HI>clean&s;e our Way.</HI> It is a <HI>Word of Wi&s;dom,</HI> and it will make us <HI>wi&s;e unto Salvation.</HI> Yea, 2 Cor. III. 18. We are <HI>changed</HI> by it, <HI>into the &s;ame Image from Glory to Glory.</HI></P>
<P>A little <HI>Seed</HI> will go a great way: A few <HI>Sow|ers</HI> may &s;oon cover an huge Tract of Land. Who can &s;ay, how much a few Hands may do in &s;preading the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD? A <HI>Paul</HI> did it for Thou&s;ands of Miles: From <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to <HI>Spain,</HI> was near Three Thou&s;and Miles. What a few Men did, as we find in Col. I. 6. <HI>It brought forth Fruit in all the World.</HI> Yea, One Sermon has con|verted Thou&s;ands. And Hundreds of Thou&s;ands have been brought into the Life of GOD, by one little Book; &s;uch as <HI>Arndts,</HI> of <HI>True Chri&s;tianity.</HI> What a <HI>Di&s;per&s;ion</HI> of Truth, has been made by Two &s;uch &s;mall <HI>Catechi&s;ms;</HI> as that of <HI>Heidelbergh,</HI> and that of our <HI>A&s;&s;embly?</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Labour</HI> of the <HI>Sower</HI> will have no <HI>Succe&s;s,</HI> without the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of the Lord, upon the <HI>Seed.</HI> It is <HI>Thou, O Lord, that prepare&s;t the Corn.</HI> The <HI>Hu&s;|bandman</HI> is an <HI>Athei&s;t,</HI> if he do not Think &s;o, and own it. The Mini&s;try of the <HI>Word,</HI> will be Un|&s;ucce&s;sful, except it <HI>receive a Ble&s;&s;ing from GOD.</HI> We are informed; 1 Cor. III. 7. <HI>Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but GOD
<PB N="26" REF="002905_0031_0FE691CAD63A8570">that giveth the Increa&s;e.</HI> The <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> proceeds not from him that brings it, or from the skill with which he brings it; but from the SPI|RIT of GOD working in it. Let <HI>I&s;aac &s;ow his Land,</HI> and if the <HI>Lord Ble&s;s him,</HI> he will <HI>receive an hundred fold.</HI></P>
<P>Finally; The <HI>Seed</HI> will not pre&s;ently &s;pring up, at the <HI>fir&s;t &s;owing</HI> of it; No, <HI>Behold, the Husband|man waits for the precious Fruit of the Earth.</HI> Nor does the Mini&s;try of the <HI>Word,</HI> pre&s;ently &s;ee all the Effect that it is to &s;ee. The <HI>Word</HI> may ly for &s;ome while under Clods, in many an unconcerned Soul. GOD by &s;ome occurence in his Providence, may bring to Remembrance a <HI>Word</HI> heard &s;ome while ago, and then it operates. Yea, it may &s;o fall out, as in Joh. IV. 37. <HI>That &s;aying is true, One &s;oweth and another reapeth.</HI> Oh! Let <HI>Parents</HI> be often dropping &s;ome <HI>Word of GOD</HI> upon their <HI>Children; In the Morning &s;ow thy Seed; and in the Evening &s;lack not thy Hand;</HI> A long while hence, it may be, af|ter thou &s;halt thy &s;elf be <HI>&s;leeping in the Du&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> that &s;eems to have been left <HI>there,</HI> &s;hall have its Efficacy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Seed</HI> you &s;ee; But, who the <HI>Sower?</HI> Be &s;ure, The <HI>owner</HI> of the <HI>Seed,</HI> is the principal <HI>&s;ower</HI> of the <HI>Seed.</HI> It is the <HI>Word</HI> of CHRIST; and it is He that <HI>&s;ows</HI> it. The <HI>&s;econd Adam</HI> is the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Husbandman,</HI> who <HI>Tills the Ground,</HI> and <HI>&s;ows</HI> the <HI>Field which the Lord has ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> But then he has his <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> who do the part of <HI>Sowers</HI> under Him. The&s;e are they who may &s;ay, as in 1. Cor. IX. 11. <HI>We have &s;own unto you &s;piritual Things.</HI></P>
<P>May our GOD Help us, That we may bring you none but the <HI>pure Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word;</HI> Pick and
<PB N="27" REF="002905_0032_0FE691CD32E1C1C0">Clean&s;e the <HI>Seed</HI> in our <HI>Studies;</HI> and not bring you the <HI>Chaff</HI> or <HI>Husks</HI> of our own <HI>Brains;</HI> or the per|nicious <HI>Darnel</HI> of un&s;criptural <HI>Error.</HI></P>
<P>May we bring you al&s;o the <HI>whole Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word;</HI> And &s;o hone&s;tly di&s;po&s;e of the <HI>Seed</HI> com|mitted unto us, that we may balk no <HI>Truth,</HI> but be able to &s;ay, <HI>I have not &s;hunned to declare unto you all the Coun&s;el of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>But may we &s;till &s;ee to it, that we <HI>Preach</HI> and <HI>Sowe</HI> to the Advantage of our <HI>Ma&s;ter:</HI> And all we do be aimed at this; That we may &s;ee you <HI>Glorifying</HI> of our Lord, and <HI>Glorified</HI> with him.</P>
<P>Wherefore, <HI>Brethren, Pray for us.</HI></P>

<P>Thus you &s;ee the <HI>Sower</HI> with the <HI>Field.</HI> But I know not how to di&s;mi&s;s this matter, without &s;ome <HI>Reflection</HI> upon it.</P>

<P>But then, <HI>Receive</HI> it Readily. <HI>Retain</HI> it Faith|fully. <HI>Improve</HI> it Suitably. In all the <HI>Fruits of the Spirit,</HI> make &s;uitable Returns to Heaven for it.

<P><HI>The Devils, like the Fowls of the Air, come and catch the Word of GOD our SAVIOUR, from tho&s;e Hearers, who&s;e Hearts are like the HIGH-WAY GROUND, where that good Seed of the Word is trod under Foot.</HI></P>
<P>We have now &s;uch In&s;tructions as the&s;e, to be thankful for.</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Devils,</HI> which fly about this <HI>Air,</HI> under the command of a <HI>Prince</HI> and a <HI>wicked One,</HI> who is called SATAN, are very fitly Re&s;embled unto the <HI>Fowls of the Air.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Cur&s;ed Spirits,</HI> are called, P&s;al. XCI. 3. <HI>Fowlers:</HI> Becau&s;e they En&s;nare, and they De|&s;troy the poor Children of Men, as the Children of Men them&s;elves, do the &s;illy <HI>Birds,</HI> which they have a de&s;ign upon. A &s;ea&s;onable and profitable <HI>Meditation</HI> for any of you, when you are upon that <HI>Recreation.</HI> But then, they are <HI>Fowls</HI> too. The <HI>Fowls</HI> and the <HI>Devils</HI> have indeed their lodging in the &s;ame Element. The <HI>Devils</HI> are, Eph II. 2. <HI>The Power,</HI> or Army, <HI>of the Air.</HI> And, Eph. VI. 12. <HI>Spiritual Wickedne&s;&s;es</HI> in tho&s;e <HI>High Places.</HI> Here the&s;e <HI>Unclean Birds</HI> will be Nea&s;ted, until our Lord JESUS CHRIST &s;hall de&s;cend with flaming Fire, to make this <HI>Air</HI> become the Seat for that <HI>City of
<PB N="31" REF="002905_0036_0FE691D53945F8D8">GOD,</HI> where his <HI>Rai&s;ed Saints</HI> will be gathered un|to him.</P>
<P>Can we tell the Number of the <HI>Fowls?</HI> There are more than Five Hundred &s;pecies of them; The Individuals are Thou&s;ands, and Myriads, and Millions; How Numberle&s;s? But the Num|ber of the <HI>Devils,</HI> may, for ought we know, ex|ceed that of the <HI>Fowls.</HI> It &s;eems, that a Demon who mole&s;ted one poor Man in the Go&s;pel, had no le&s;s than a <HI>Legion</HI> at hand under his Ordering, like &s;o many <HI>French Dragoons,</HI> to &s;eize him and vex him.</P>
<P>What can emulate the <HI>Swiftne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Fowls?</HI> Yea, but the <HI>Eagles ha&s;tening to the Prey</HI> are not &s;o <HI>&s;wift,</HI> as tho&s;e <HI>Fowls</HI> of a &s;tronger Wing, the <HI>De|vils,</HI> when coming down to prey upon us. The <HI>Devils</HI> will convey them&s;elves from one &s;ide of the Earth to the other, doubtle&s;s, as fa&s;t as the Earth it &s;elf can whirl about upon its <HI>Axis.</HI> Or as our Lord &s;aw the <HI>Devils</HI> falling like the <HI>Lightening,</HI> why mayn't we &s;uppo&s;e 'em flying like the very <HI>Lightning?</HI></P>
<P>Finally; The mo&s;t <HI>mi&s;chievous Fowls,</HI> are there|in an Emblem of the <HI>Devils,</HI> who delight in <HI>Mi&s;|chief.</HI> What are the <HI>Devils</HI> but <HI>Birds of prey?</HI> The Bible calls them, <HI>Foul Spirits,</HI> and, <HI>filthy and hate|ful Birds.</HI> When we read, Mat. XIII. 19. of, The <HI>Wicked One catcheth away, what is &s;own in the Heart,</HI> there is a Greek word u&s;ed, which implies, that the <HI>wicked One</HI> is an horrid <HI>Harpye</HI> to the Souls of Men.</P>
<P>But, O ye <HI>Souls in peril;</HI> &s;ince you have &s;uch perillous <HI>Fowls of the Air</HI> continually fluttering a|bout you; Hearken, Hearken to the kind Calls of
<PB N="32" REF="002905_0037_0FE691D55BC4DF18">your SAVIOUR; Hear the kind <HI>Cloques</HI> of &s;uch a gracious Protector; Mat. XXIII. 37. <HI>How often would I have gathered thy Children, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an Hen gather|eth her Chickens under her Wings!</HI> Oh! Get under this protection, by the flights of a lively Faith unto it!</P>
<P N="2">II. Wherever the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is di&s;pen&s;ed, there the <HI>Devils</HI> will immediately come to <HI>&s;teal</HI> the good <HI>Seed</HI> of that <HI>Word,</HI> from the Hearts which it is ca&s;t upon.</P>
<P>Be advi&s;ed of this, O wor&s;hippers of GOD; That in whatever <HI>Exerci&s;e of Religion</HI> you are en|gaged, the <HI>Devils</HI> will with &s;ome <HI>Temptation</HI> there immediately fall upon you. Even in the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of GOD, and where the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is di&s;pen&s;ed, we mu&s;t look to meet with <HI>Devils;</HI> and when the <HI>Sons of GOD</HI> come to <HI>pre&s;ent them&s;elves before the Lord, Satan will al&s;o come among them.</HI> You are to <HI>Watch</HI> again&s;t your never-weary, never-&s;leeping <HI>Adver&s;ary,</HI> not only in your <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and in your <HI>Travelling,</HI> and in your friendly <HI>Conver&s;ations,</HI> but in your <HI>Devotions</HI> too.</P>
<P>Be yet more particularly advi&s;ed of it; That the <HI>Devils</HI> are very particularly de&s;irous, to hinder that good <HI>Seed,</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, from taking <HI>Root</HI> in your Hearts. The <HI>Word of the Kingdom,</HI> tends to re&s;cue the Souls of Men from the <HI>power of Darkne&s;s,</HI> and the <HI>Kingdom of Satan,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Tran&s;late</HI> them into the <HI>Kingdom of the Son</HI> of GOD. It is the Word of a SAVIOUR: It is the <HI>Go&s;pel of our Salvation.</HI> The <HI>Devils</HI> are grievou&s;ly di&s;tur|bed at the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD; It gives 'em a fright|ful <HI>Alarum;</HI> They are afraid le&s;t it prove the
<PB N="33" REF="002905_0038_0FE691360BC0F4F8"><HI>Power of GOD unto the Salvation</HI> of them that &s;it under it; They &s;u&s;pect the lo&s;ing of &s;ome Slave or other from their <HI>Empire,</HI> by the verticordious Power of it. They &s;urmi&s;e, the <HI>Prey</HI> will be <HI>taken from the Mighty,</HI> and the <HI>Lawful Captive be deliver|ed.</HI> The <HI>Salvation</HI> of <HI>Sinners,</HI> is a <HI>Vexation</HI> of <HI>Devils.</HI> Their <HI>Malice</HI> cannot bear it, that while they are <HI>Damned,</HI> any of Mankind &s;hould be <HI>Saved.</HI> Our <HI>Heaven</HI> adds Oyl to the Flame of the <HI>Hell,</HI> from whence the <HI>Smoke of their Torment a&s;cends for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>And then, finally, Be advi&s;ed of This; There are many <HI>ways,</HI> by which the <HI>Devils</HI> do <HI>catch up</HI> the good <HI>Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> when your Hearts have it falling upon them.</P>
<P>What the&s;e <HI>De&s;troyers</HI> of Souls, and <HI>Hinderers</HI> of all that is Good, would be at, is, To &s;poil our <HI>At|tention</HI> to the <HI>Word</HI> of our GOD and SAVIOUR But how is it, that the <HI>Enemy does This!</HI></P>
<P>They do it, by injecting of Impertinent and Un&s;ea&s;onable <HI>Thoughts</HI> of <HI>other Things</HI> into our Hearts, when we &s;hould be <HI>Thinking</HI> on the <HI>Word</HI> of our GOD. What is the <HI>way of the Serpent on the Rock</HI> in this, and how 'tis that the <HI>Devils</HI> convey Thoughts into our Minds; This is a <HI>Thing too wonderful</HI> for me; 'tis <HI>what I know not.</HI> But the <HI>matter of Fact,</HI> is what I <HI>know,</HI> and am certain of. The <HI>Devils</HI> are <HI>Wandring Spirits,</HI> and they have a Faculty to throw <HI>Wandring Thoughts</HI> into our <HI>Spi|rits.</HI> When the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is ca&s;t upon us, it may be &s;ome <HI>Filthy Thoughts,</HI> or &s;ome <HI>Angry Thoughts,</HI> or, at lea&s;t, &s;ome <HI>worldly Thoughts,</HI> will then be ca&s;t in, and carry away our Minds from what they &s;hould be upon. Our GOD may &s;ay
<PB N="34" REF="002905_0039_0FE691362868BDE8">of us; Ezek. XXXIII. 31. <HI>They &s;it before thee as my People, they hear thy Words, but their Heart goeth af|ter their Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> While our GOD is tendering his <HI>Word</HI> unto us, the <HI>Devils</HI> throw in the <HI>Images</HI> of a <HI>Bargain,</HI> or a <HI>Journey,</HI> and &s;ome contrivance for our <HI>worldly Advantage,</HI> or, perhaps, what is yet more <HI>Ba&s;e</HI> than &s;o: And while we think on the&s;e things, the good <HI>Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> is picked away mo&s;t unaccountably. If the Me&s;&s;enger of GOD, &s;hould &s;uddenly ask of &s;ome, <HI>What was the la&s;t Seed of the word ca&s;t upon you?</HI> They mu&s;t with Confu|&s;ion own, <HI>I did not Regard what it was.</HI> Thus the <HI>Devils</HI> have &s;natched it away. <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> make the <HI>Word</HI> of our SAVIOUR to be <HI>in vain</HI> di&s;pen|&s;ed unto us. O my Hearers, <HI>What are you Thinking on?</HI> If upon Recollection you find, that your Thoughts are at any time gone away from the <HI>word,</HI> whereof you &s;hould be more diligent Hear|ers, think with Horror upon it; <HI>Some Devil is now at work upon me!</HI></P>
<P>Agaid, They do it, by <HI>prejudicing</HI> our Hearts again&s;t the <HI>Word</HI> of our GOD, or the Di&s;pen&s;ers of it. Sometimes, the good <HI>Seed</HI> of the <HI>word</HI> it&s;elf is not liked. Either the <HI>Proud Men</HI> &s;ay to the Pro|phet, <HI>Thou &s;peake&s;t Fal&s;ly.</HI> Or, &s;omething in the <HI>manner</HI> of &s;peaking it, is not plea&s;ing. But oftner, 'Tis the <HI>Seeds-Man,</HI> that is not liked. The <HI>Devils</HI> would fain have the <HI>Feet</HI> of them who <HI>Preach the Go&s;pel of Peace,</HI> to be not <HI>Beautiful:</HI> but have <HI>wrong &s;teps</HI> charged upon them, to fill our Minds with <HI>Prejudices</HI> again&s;t them. Not only would the <HI>De|vils</HI> bring the Hearers, to that <HI>Contempt</HI> of tho&s;e who come unto them, <HI>What is it this Babler &s;ays?</HI> But al&s;o that <HI>Hatred</HI> of them; 1 King. XXII. 8.
<PB N="35" REF="002905_0040_0FE6913D45D8AC70"><HI>I hate him.</HI> It is a potent Engine, that the <HI>Devils</HI> have, to take away the <HI>Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> from our <HI>Hearts,</HI> when they have made our Hearts to dislike the <HI>Hands</HI> which throw it upon us. 'Tis done &s;ometimes by more <HI>Immediate Sugge&s;tions,</HI> which fill the <HI>Hearts</HI> of Men with <HI>Grudges</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e Di&s;|pen&s;ers of the <HI>Word,</HI> from whom they might o|therwi&s;e have the greate&s;t Benefit. Many have a <HI>Di&s;ta&s;te</HI> for &s;uch; and can give no <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> for it. But the <HI>Spirit that works in them,</HI> can give the <HI>Rea|&s;on; is</HI> the <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> Sometimes 'tis done, by the <HI>Tools</HI> of Ungodly <HI>Tongues,</HI> and <HI>Pens;</HI> The <HI>Devils</HI> never want Venemous <HI>Defamers,</HI> and Scandalous <HI>Libellers,</HI> and Pe&s;tilent <HI>Scoffers,</HI> to dre&s;s up the Ser|vants of GOD in <HI>Bear-skins,</HI> and throw them out unto the Dogs. The&s;e <HI>Black birds of Hell,</HI> do mightily prevent the <HI>Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> from getting well into the <HI>Hearts</HI> of the poi&s;oned People. Who &s;ets them to <HI>work?</HI> Even, he that will pay them their <HI>Wages.</HI> To &s;uch Emi&s;&s;aries of the wicked One, the Spirit of GOD &s;ays, <HI>O Full of all Mi&s;|chief, Thou Child of the Devil, Thou Enemy of all Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s!</HI> Chri&s;tians, when &s;ome <HI>Slanderers</HI> are talking with you, or when &s;ome Virulent and A|bu&s;ive <HI>Pamphlets</HI> are before you, you may do well to think, <HI>The Devil now de&s;igns upon me!</HI></P>
<P>Once more; They do it by making us <HI>Drow&s;y</HI> and <HI>Sleepy,</HI> when the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD &s;hould have the Re&s;pects of a wakeful Attention paid unto it. When the be&s;t Preacher in the World, was ca&s;ting the <HI>Seed,</HI> we find one; A&amp;. XX. 9. <HI>Fallen into a deep Sleep.</HI> Who <HI>Rocqued</HI> the <HI>Cradle,</HI> I pray? From a Man that is <HI>A&s;leep,</HI> any thing may be taken away. When the <HI>Devils</HI> have lulled us <HI>A&s;leep,</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="002905_0041_0FE691D92B085B80">they may, and they do, take away from our Hearts, the good <HI>Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word.</HI> There is ma|ny a whole&s;ome <HI>Le&s;&s;on,</HI> many an u&s;eful <HI>Coun&s;il,</HI> ma|ny a needful <HI>Caution,</HI> which might get into our <HI>Hearts,</HI> and &s;tick there. But the <HI>Devils</HI> have chea|ted us thereof, by laying us fa&s;t <HI>A&s;leep,</HI> at the time that they were uttered. Oh! That we were more on our Guard! There may indeed be &s;ome <HI>Fee|blene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Heavine&s;s</HI> of <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> which may &s;ometimes betray very Godly People into this Mi&s;carriage.

<P N="3">III. An <HI>Highway Ground</HI> are the <HI>Hearts</HI> of tho&s;e, who permit the <HI>Devils</HI> to &s;teal the good <HI>Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> from them, in their Hearing of it. An Elegant Similitude! For,</P>
<P>The <HI>Seed</HI> that falls on the <HI>Highway,</HI> does not <HI>&s;ink</HI> into the <HI>Earth,</HI> but ly on the top of it. There are Hearers of the <HI>Word,</HI> who are too unmindful of our SAVIOUR's Direction; Luk, IX. 44. <HI>Let the&s;e &s;ayings &s;ink down into you.</HI> The <HI>Word</HI> has no more than a <HI>Superficiary Touch</HI> upon them. It may inform their <HI>Heads,</HI> but their <HI>Hearts</HI> are not reach|ed by it, not moved by it, not changed by it.</P>
<P>Again; The <HI>Seed</HI> that falls on the <HI>Highway,</HI> is not <HI>look'd after.</HI> There are Hearers of the <HI>Word</HI> who don't <HI>look after</HI> what has fallen upon them, to &s;ee what comes of it; but it is with them accor|ding to That; Jam. I. 23, 24. <HI>He is an Hearer of the Word, and not a Doer; He goes his way, and &s;traightway forgets.</HI> They do not <HI>Ruminate</HI> on the <HI>Word</HI> they have heard; their <HI>Hearts</HI> don't recall any thing of it; but they carry toward it, as if they had never been concerned with it.</P>
<P>Moreover; <HI>High-ways</HI> are <HI>common Roads;</HI> They are ways that ly <HI>common</HI> and <HI>open</HI> and <HI>obvious</HI> for every Pa&s;&s;enger. The <HI>Hearts</HI> of many that hear the <HI>Word,</HI> are not as <HI>Gardens enclo&s;ed;</HI> but they are
<PB N="38" REF="002905_0043_0FE691D94C300A78">the Walk of <HI>Satan;</HI> the Print of his <HI>Cloven Foot</HI> is to be &s;een upon them: Nothing, tho' ever &s;o Evil, is kept out of them. For this Cau&s;e, the Denomination of the <HI>Gentiies,</HI> who in Matth. XXII. 10. are called, <HI>The High-Way,</HI> may be put upon them.</P>
<P>La&s;tly; In the <HI>Highways</HI> the <HI>Seed</HI> that is ca&s;t by <HI>Hand</HI> is ca&s;t under the <HI>Foot;</HI> It is Trampled on. Verily, There are Hearers of the <HI>Word,</HI> of whom we read; Heb. X. 29. <HI>They have trodden under Foot the Son of GFD.</HI> Be &s;ure then, they <HI>Tread un|der Foot</HI> His <HI>Word;</HI> They <HI>Trample</HI> on the <HI>Command|ments,</HI> the <HI>Promi&s;es,</HI> the <HI>Threatnings</HI> of it. There may this Account be given of them; <HI>They De&s;pi&s;e His Word, until the Wrath of the Lord ari&s;e again&s;t them, and there is no Remedy.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot go off this <HI>Highway Ground,</HI> without making at lea&s;t the&s;e Two Remarks upon it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Under who&s;e Malignant Influence, do you think, mu&s;t they be, that frequently and needle&s;sly <HI>Ab&s;ent</HI> them&s;elves from the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD our SAVIOUR, when they might enjoy the Di&s;pen&s;ations of it? If it be <HI>Satan</HI> that <HI>&s;teals</HI> the <HI>Good Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> from the <HI>Way</HI> on which it falls, doubtle&s;s, it mu&s;t be <HI>Satan,</HI> who <HI>&s;teals</HI> Peo|ple from the <HI>Way</HI> of the <HI>Seed.</HI> He who does <HI>Catch</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> from us, is he who does <HI>Keep</HI> us from the <HI>Word.</HI> The Jews gave this as a Defini|tion of a <HI>Bad Neighbour,</HI> Tis, <HI>One who don't come to the Synagogue.</HI> If there be &s;uch a <HI>Bad Neighbour</HI> in the Town, we &s;ee, what is the <HI>Bad Spirit</HI> that makes him &s;o. It is noted of <HI>Origen,</HI> That in his Vigorous Homilies, he Reproved no Crime &s;o much, as that of <HI>Ab&s;ence from the Holy A&s;&s;emblies.</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="002905_0044_0FE6913F6ABED348">This Crime I now Reprove, with telling you, whom you &s;erve and plea&s;e in the committing of it; The <HI>Devils!</HI></P>
<P>It may be, the mo&s;t Criminal are at this time, <HI>out of Hearing.</HI> Wherefore, let &s;uch as wi&s;h well to them, carry them home &s;omething from the place where they &s;hould have been. Ask them to read that awful Scripture; Joh. VIII. 47 <HI>He that is of GOD, hears the Words of GOD; you there|fore hear them not, becau&s;e you are not of GOD.</HI> If they plead, They have not <HI>Cloathes</HI> fine enough; Ask them, whether they had not better come with <HI>mean Cloathes,</HI> where they may have the <HI>Garments of Salvation</HI> put upon their Souls, than remain <HI>Wretched, and Mi&s;erable, and Poor, and Blind, and Naked,</HI> as they are? Ask them, Whether they mu&s;t not &s;hortly be &s;hrowded in a <HI>Winding-Sheet,</HI> and their <HI>Naked Souls</HI> will not then wi&s;h, that a pretence of <HI>Mean Cloathes</HI> had not kept them a|mong them that <HI>Hate In&s;truction.</HI> If they profane|ly tell you, <HI>They Read a Chapter in</HI> Job: Turn them to Job. XXIII. 12. <HI>I have e&s;teemed the Words of His Mouth more than my Nece&s;&s;ary Food.</HI> Ask them, Whether <HI>they</HI> can &s;ay &s;o; and what they think will be the portion of them, who can't &s;ay &s;o?</P>
<P>Secondly. What is to be done, for our Defence from the <HI>Fowls of the Air?</HI> What, that the Infae|licity of the <HI>Highway Ground,</HI> may not be ours, in our <HI>Hearing</HI> the Word of our GOD?</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>Stony Ground.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We are informed, Secondly, That &s;ome who hear the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, prove like a <HI>Stony Ground,</HI> when the <HI>Seed</HI> is ca&s;t upon it: A <HI>Stony Ground,</HI> on which if the <HI>Seed</HI> has any Effect, yet it has no la&s;ting ones. Our SAVIOUR thus gives us to <HI>under&s;tand the Parable, and the Interpretation; The Words of the wi&s;e, and His Dark Sayings,</HI> are by
<PB N="41" REF="002905_0046_0FE6912CD57C1388">Him&s;elf thus Interpreted. <HI>The&s;e are they which are &s;own,</HI> (that is to &s;ay, They that receive the <HI>Seed</HI>) on <HI>Stony Ground, who when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladne&s;s: And have no Root in them&s;elves, and &s;o endure but for a time; Af|terward, when Affliction or Per&s;ecution ari&s;eth for the words &s;ake, immediately they are offended.</HI> The Suc|ce&s;s of the Go&s;pel <HI>&s;own</HI> upon Hearts that are like the <HI>Stony Ground,</HI> is, you &s;ee, fir&s;t, very <HI>commend|able</HI> and comfortable; then, very <HI>mi&s;erable</HI> and la|mentable.</P>
<P>The Admonition to be now pro&s;ecuted, is This.</P>
<P><HI>In &s;ome Hearers of the word, who&s;e Heart is like the Stony Ground, that Good Seed of the Word may be Re|ceived with &s;ome &s;eeming Faith and Joy; But in a Time of Temptation, they and their Faith and their Joy, do quickly and &s;adly wither away.</HI></P>
<P>In the Pro&s;ecution of it, let the&s;e <HI>In&s;tructions</HI> find &s;ome Entertainment with you.</P>
<P N="1">I. A <HI>Stony Ground</HI> is that which a <HI>&s;inful Heart,</HI> may be too ju&s;tly compared unto. Inheed, the <HI>Heart</HI> of every Man, in his Fallen and Corrupt Nature, is as <HI>hard</HI> as a <HI>Stone; Hard</HI> like the <HI>Ne|ther Mil&s;tone.</HI> And many do by <HI>Cu&s;tome</HI> add unto that <HI>hardne&s;s of Heart,</HI> which is by <HI>Nature</HI> in them. 'Tis called, Ezek. XI. 19. A <HI>Stony Heart.</HI> In a <HI>Stone</HI> there is a clo&s;e Fa&s;tning, and Knitting, and Combining of the parts together, whereby it is made &s;trong to re&s;i&s;t, whatever would from with|out act upon it. Such a <HI>Stone</HI> is this <HI>Heart</HI> of ours, &amp; &s;o does it <HI>Re&s;i&s;t,</HI> the E&s;&s;ays of Heaven to work up|on it. Our GOD may &s;ay of us; as in Zech.
<PB N="42" REF="002905_0047_0FE6913F8BB87D00">VII. 12. <HI>They made their Hearts hard as an Ada|mant-Stone, le&s;t they &s;hould hear the Law.</HI> No <HI>Stone</HI> can be more <HI>In&s;en&s;ible;</HI> No <HI>Stone</HI> can be more <HI>In|flexible,</HI> than this wretched <HI>Heart</HI> of ours under all the means of Good that are employ'd upon it. And as we read, Prov. XXVII. 3. <HI>A Stone is Hea|vy:</HI> Even &s;uch al&s;o is this <HI>Heart</HI> of ours; There is no <HI>moving</HI> of it. It is as addicted unto the <HI>Earth,</HI> as the <HI>Heavy Stone,</HI> which by its <HI>weight</HI> will de|&s;cend unto the <HI>Earth.</HI> It will <HI>mind Earthly Things;</HI> and not ea&s;ily be <HI>moved</HI> from the wickedne&s;s of tending to the <HI>Earth</HI> as the <HI>Center</HI> of it. Be &s;ure, a <HI>Stone</HI> is no good Soyl to <HI>Sow</HI> upon. But is our <HI>unfruitful Heart</HI> any better? Tho' the <HI>good Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> falls upon it, there is little <HI>good Fruit</HI> commonly obtained of it.</P>
<P>Oh! That we did every one more <HI>know</HI> this <HI>Plague of our own Heart! Feel</HI> thy <HI>Stony Heart,</HI> O &s;erious Penitent. Thy <HI>Feeling</HI> of it, and thy <HI>Groan|ing</HI> bitterly and grievou&s;ly under it; <HI>Alas, my hard Heart! My hard Heart!</HI> This would be the fir&s;t Symptom of the <HI>Hardne&s;s</HI> going off. That horri|ble Di&s;ea&s;e of the <HI>Stone</HI> in the <HI>Wheel broken at the Ci&s;tern,</HI> would not be a greater matter of Horror to us, than the <HI>Stone</HI> in our <HI>Heart,</HI> if the very E&s;|&s;ence of the <HI>Stone</HI> did not ly in our not <HI>Feeling</HI> of what we have cau&s;e to be mo&s;t concern'd about.</P>
<P N="2">II. Some Hearers of the <HI>Word</HI> who&s;e <HI>Hearts</HI> are like <HI>Stones</HI> under it, yet may with &s;ome <HI>Faith</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Joy</HI> &s;eem to Receive the <HI>good Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> that falls upon them. This is as much as to &s;ay, That there are &s;ome Di&s;&s;emblers, (we may call them, <HI>&s;hining Stones</HI>) among the Hearers of the
<PB N="43" REF="002905_0048_0FE6914450816338"><HI>Word,</HI> who may go a great way in the <HI>Religion</HI> which the <HI>Word</HI> calleth for, and yet peri&s;h after all. There is not a more lawful Meditation for a Chri&s;tian to affect him&s;elf withal, than This; How far a Man may go in Chri&s;tianity, and yet after all be found among the Fal&s;e-hearted Hear|ers of the <HI>Word.</HI> There is no <HI>Grace,</HI> but what may have a <HI>Counterfeit.</HI> A <HI>Stony Heart,</HI> is a <HI>Cheat|ing</HI> one; 'Tis <HI>Deceitful above all things.</HI> Others, and even our&s;elves too, may be <HI>deceived</HI> by it. It will out do, even the Spirit that is called, <HI>The De|ceiver of the Nations.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t; There is a <HI>Faith</HI> which <HI>Fal&s;e-hearted</HI> Hearers of the <HI>Word</HI> may pretend unto. We read, Luk. VIII. 13. <HI>For a while they believe.</HI> A True <HI>Ju&s;tifying Faith</HI> will be for more than <HI>a while;</HI> By its <HI>Uniting</HI> the Beleever to his Redeemer, it brings him into tho&s;e Hands, from whence nothing ever can pull him away. The meer <HI>Stony Ground</HI> has not this <HI>Faith</HI> growing in it. But there is a <HI>Tem|porary Faith</HI> may look like a <HI>Ju&s;tifying Faith;</HI> and meer <HI>Stony Ground,</HI> may have a <HI>Weed,</HI> that &s;hall &s;eem this <HI>Herb of Grace.</HI> A <HI>Fal&s;e-Hearted</HI> Hearer of the <HI>Word,</HI> may yield &s;ome <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> unto the <HI>Truth</HI> of the <HI>Word:</HI> Which indeed the very <HI>Devils</HI> do, with <HI>Trembling</HI> at it. Yea, he may profe&s;s to yield &s;ome <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> unto it. Every <HI>Bapti&s;ed</HI> Per&s;on is a <HI>Profe&s;s'd Servant</HI> of GOD. But, alas, how many under the <HI>Livery</HI> of CHRIST in their <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> have their Souls <HI>Unbapti&s;ed,</HI> Unpurified, Un&s;anc|tified. Indeed, if a Man give a Real and Hearty <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> unto the <HI>Methods of Grace</HI> in our Salvation by a Glorious CHRIST, &s;uch a Man &s;hall be un|doubtedly Saved and Happy. But a <HI>&s;incere Con&s;ent</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="002905_0049_0FE691446D2864F0">is one thing, and a <HI>profe&s;s'd Con&s;ent</HI> is another. Some do <HI>Profe&s;s</HI> to <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> unto the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD, and yet continue in the <HI>Gall of Bitterne&s;s and Bond of Iniquity.</HI> Behold, A Tragical Example; Act. VIII. 13 <HI>Simon him&s;elf believed al&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; There is al&s;o a <HI>Joy</HI> which <HI>Fal&s;e-hear|ted</HI> Hearers of the <HI>Word</HI> may attain unto. We read, Mat. XIII. 20. Such an one, <HI>Hears the Word, and anon with Joy receiveth it.</HI> There is the <HI>Joy</HI> of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul finding in an Al&s;uffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ent CHRIST the Relief of its Di&s;tre&s;&s;es; a <HI>Joy</HI> ac|companied with a bitter and pungent <HI>Grief,</HI> in a <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> of Sin, as the wor&s;t Evil in the World: This is a <HI>Joy</HI> which the meer <HI>Stony Ground</HI> is a &s;tranger to; A <HI>&s;tranger</HI> to <HI>Regeneration</HI> does not <HI>intermeddle</HI> with it. But there is a <HI>Fla&s;hy Joy,</HI> which may look very like that <HI>Sacred Joy.</HI> A <HI>Fal&s;e-hearted</HI> Hearer of the <HI>Word,</HI> may have &s;ome <HI>Delight</HI> in the Exerci&s;e of <HI>Hearing</HI> it&s;elf; may <HI>love to Hear</HI> &s;uch a Man. The Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> had &s;ome &s;uch atten|ding on his Mini&s;try. Yea, he may have &s;ome <HI>Delight</HI> in &s;ome doing of &s;omething of what he hears. <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> had &s;ome Followers that were none of the be&s;t; of whom it is reported; Joh. V. 35. <HI>Ye were willing for a &s;ea&s;on to rejoice in his Light.</HI> Many may find it for their Secular Advantage to comply with &s;ome things, which they <HI>hear</HI> in the Word of GOD. There are <HI>Loaves!</HI> Thus, at the <HI>Reformation,</HI> very many People were <HI>glad</HI> of that <HI>Word</HI> which decried the Abominations of <HI>Popery.</HI> The Gentry became enriched with <HI>Ab|bey-lands,</HI> and the Pea&s;ants were delivered from the Tyranny of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> and were taught how to come at the <HI>Pardon</HI> of their Sins, without being
<PB N="45" REF="002905_0050_0FE69146A1FCAB18"><HI>Prie&s;t-ridden</HI> into cruel <HI>Penances</HI> for it. But accor|ding to the Ancient Prophecy, <HI>many,</HI> yea, the mo&s;t, <HI>Cleave to the</HI> Reformation <HI>only with Flatteries;</HI> Their Hearts don't like the Maxims, which it mu&s;t live upon!</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Hearers</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> that <HI>&s;eem to Re|joice</HI> it, will meet with a <HI>Time of Temptation,</HI> to <HI>try</HI> whether they have <HI>indeed received</HI> it. We read, Luk. VIII. 13. <HI>A Time of Temptation comes upon them.</HI> When the <HI>Seed</HI> has been <HI>&s;own</HI> upon the Ground, the <HI>Sun</HI> will be up, and fall with <HI>&s;corching Beams,</HI> upon it. A fit Emblem of the <HI>Temptation,</HI> which they that <HI>Hear,</HI> and &s;eem to <HI>like,</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, mu&s;t look to meet withal.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, There will be the more general <HI>Tempta|tion</HI> of <HI>Adver&s;ity,</HI> to try the <HI>&s;incerity</HI> and <HI>per&s;everance</HI> of them that &s;eem to Receive the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD. We read, Mat. IV. 17. <HI>Affliction ari&s;eth.</HI> Many may have the Vanity to expect little <HI>Affliction,</HI> when their <HI>ways</HI> are <HI>once directed for keeping the &s;ta|tutes of GOD.</HI> O vain Dream! When our SAVI|OUR has expre&s;sly forewarned us, <HI>In the world ye &s;hall have Tribulation!</HI> But, by <HI>Adver&s;ity,</HI> there will be a <HI>Trial</HI> made of us, whether we really Re|ceive the <HI>word</HI> of GOD as we &s;ay, we do. <HI>Self-denial</HI> is what the <HI>word</HI> of GOD in the fir&s;t place, indi&s;pen&s;ably calls for; Tis, the <HI>Fir&s;t Le&s;&s;on</HI> of the <HI>word.</HI> When <HI>Adver&s;ity</HI> comes, it lays the <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> on us. It is now <HI>Tried,</HI> how we can bear it, and whe|ther we can patiently <HI>deny</HI> our &s;elves of every thing at the Call and for the &s;ake of, our Lord. If under <HI>Adver&s;ity</HI> we &s;uitably, quietly, fruitfully bear the <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> and forego what we mu&s;t part
<PB N="46" REF="002905_0051_0FE69146C399A950">withal; then we have Received the <HI>word</HI> of GOD aright. But if under <HI>Adver&s;ity,</HI> we grow weary of &s;erving our Lord, and of waiting on Him, and of &s;itting under His Di&s;cipline; then the <HI>word</HI> of GOD was never well received in our Souls. Oh! that being <HI>Tried we may come forth as Gold;</HI> And by <HI>Learning the &s;tatutes</HI> of GOD from it, and be|coming more f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m in our Adhering, and more full in our Conforming unto them for it, we may find it <HI>Good for us that we have been afflicted.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; There will be the more &s;pecial <HI>Temp|tation</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> to try our <HI>&s;incerity</HI> and <HI>per&s;eve|rance.</HI> We read, Mat. XIII. 21. <HI>Per&s;ecution ari&s;eth becau&s;e of the Word. Cain</HI>'s Club walks about, unto this very Day; and we have a fair praemonition; <HI>All that will live Godlily in CHRIST JESUS &s;hall &s;uffer Per&s;ecution.</HI> Until the &s;econd Coming of our great GOD and SAVIOUR, the World will ne|ver &s;ee a Day, wherein a Man may be an <HI>Holy Man,</HI> and &s;uffer nothing for being &s;o. For, <HI>Satan</HI> will not be <HI>Bound,</HI> until the &s;econd Coming of the Lord. And until <HI>Satan</HI> be <HI>Bound,</HI> we cannot ima|gine, that he will cea&s;e to give Trouble unto all that <HI>Love the Lord JESUS CHRIST in &s;incerity.</HI> The <HI>Third Chapter</HI> of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> will never cea&s;e to operate, until we come to the <HI>Twentieth Chapter</HI> of the <HI>Revelation.</HI> Where the <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> of the <HI>Hand</HI> is Re&s;trained, and wicked Men have not their Tools to work withal, yet the <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> of the <HI>Tongue,</HI> and the Methods to expre&s;s much <HI>Unkind|ne&s;s,</HI> much <HI>Aver&s;ion,</HI> will never fail. But as in the Days of <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> even <HI>&s;o it is now.</HI> The genuine Children of GOD, mu&s;t be <HI>hated,</HI> and <HI>mocked,</HI> and <HI>wronged,</HI> by the <HI>Children of the wicked one.</HI> By this
<PB N="47" REF="002905_0052_0FE6914CDC05E3A0"><HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> there will be a <HI>Trial</HI> made of us; whe|ther we do throughly Receive the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, and will by no means part with it; <HI>Hold fa&s;t what we have received.</HI> It is <HI>Tried</HI> what Metal we are made of. If we can't bear to be Vilified and Ridiculed, for being &s;trictly Con&s;ciencious, we have not yet Received the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD. If we had rather commit a <HI>Sin</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, than incur a <HI>Scoff</HI> on the &s;core of our keep|ing the <HI>Word,</HI> Ah! Woful Soul, Thou ha&s;t never yet Received it. But, if we can encounter <HI>Hard Mea&s;ures</HI> for our Fidelity to the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, and will <HI>keep</HI> the <HI>word,</HI> whatever it <HI>co&s;t</HI> us, Then indeed we have <HI>Received the Truth in the Love of it.</HI> Oh! That in the <HI>Fiery Trial,</HI> we may be found, what &s;hall be for <HI>Prai&s;e and Honour and Glory at the Appearing of the Lord!</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Fal&s;e-hearted</HI> Hearers of the <HI>Word,</HI> will wretchedly <HI>wither,</HI> when <HI>Temptation &s;corches</HI> them. Not having the <HI>Root</HI> and the <HI>Sap</HI> of a good Prin|ciple in them, to feed that PIETY which they &s;eem to have, they <HI>wither,</HI> they <HI>wither!</HI> Yea, <HI>while they are yet in their Greenne&s;s, and not cut down, they wither before any other Herb: So are the Paths of all that forget GOD, and the Hypocrites hope &s;hall peri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>If it be enquired; What is the <HI>withering</HI> where|to the Corn of the <HI>Stony Ground</HI> is obnoxious? It mu&s;t be An&s;wered; It is the <HI>Apo&s;ta&s;y</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Fal&s;e hearted</HI> ones, thro' prejudice at the <HI>Right ways of the Lord.</HI> In Two of the Evangeli&s;ts we read, <HI>They are Offended;</HI> In the Third we read, <HI>They fall away.</HI> Tis no rare thing, for <HI>Hypocrites</HI> to prove <HI>Apo&s;tates.</HI> Our SAVIOUR had &s;ome Di&s;ciples,
<PB N="48" REF="002905_0053_0FE6914CF8008088">who <HI>went away,</HI> and <HI>walked no more with Him.</HI> The Primitive Churches, had tho&s;e who <HI>went out from them,</HI> not being truly <HI>of them.</HI> All Ages have Ex|amples of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Fal&s;e-hearted</HI> ones often come to a <HI>wither|ing,</HI> even in their very <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion.</HI> They Renounce the <HI>Orthodox Faith,</HI> with which they once flouri&s;h|ed in the Field of the Church. Or, if not &s;o, yet in&s;tead of &s;tanding up for GOD, and CHRIST, and Holine&s;s, they become Formal, Carnal, In&s;i|pid Creatures, and <HI>ca&s;t off the thing that is Good.</HI></P>
<P>They come to a <HI>withering</HI> in their <HI>Affection.</HI> They <HI>leave their fir&s;t Love:</HI> Their <HI>Love</HI> to the <HI>De|votions,</HI> to the <HI>Appointments,</HI> to the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of GOD, all vani&s;hes; and all their old <HI>Zeal</HI> is ex|tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Yea, they come to a <HI>withering</HI> of the <HI>Gifts</HI> that once adorned them. They can't <HI>pray</HI> and <HI>&s;peak</HI> as once they could. Their Parts are &s;o <HI>withered,</HI> that every one may plainly &s;ee, <HI>The Man is not what once he was.</HI></P>
<P>And at la&s;t it comes to that; Job XXVII. 8. <HI>What is the hope of the Hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when GOD &s;hall take away his Soul?</HI> All the <HI>Seed</HI> ca&s;t on the <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> and all the <HI>&s;how</HI> of Good i&s;&s;uing from it, comes to nothing.</P>
<P>Some Reflection mu&s;t be made upon the&s;e things. Tho' the <HI>Stony Ground</HI> yields no <HI>Fruit</HI> unto the <HI>Husbandman,</HI> let us reap &s;ome <HI>Fruit</HI> from the <HI>Stony Ground</HI> before we leave it.</P>
<P>Beware, Beware, O my Hearers, that what Im|pre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Religion</HI> may have been made upon you, do not <HI>wither</HI> in <HI>Apo&s;ta&s;y.</HI> The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD has doubtle&s;s rai&s;ed &s;ome good <HI>Motions,</HI> &amp; &s;ome good

<P>Secondly, Be concerned, O you that have the <HI>Good Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> falling on you, that it may come to have a good and a deep <HI>Root</HI> within you.

<P>Again; What are the <HI>Thorns</HI> on the <HI>Earth,</HI> but the Fruits of the <HI>Cur&s;e.</HI> Po&s;&s;ibly, there would have been <HI>Thorns,</HI> if Man had not finned: They may be <HI>&s;erviceable</HI> to us.

Secondly. There are <HI>worldly Lu&s;ts</HI> more pecu|liar to <HI>Rich People,</HI> which hinder the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD from having a good Effect, e&s;pecially upon that &s;ort of People.

Our Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> never Preach'd more un&s;ucce&s;&s;|fully, than when he had an Auditory of <HI>Rich Folks,</HI> to Preach the <HI>Word</HI> unto. <HI>Rich Folks</HI> have many <HI>Employments,</HI> many <HI>Diver&s;ions;</HI> If the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD come unto them they &s;ay like that <HI>Unhappy</HI> Man, <HI>I will hear thee at a more convenient &s;ea&s;on.

<P>Thirdly; There are many <HI>Lu&s;ts</HI> incident unto all &s;orts of People, thro' which it is that the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD comes to be without a good Effect upon them: Even tho&s;e which our SAVIOUR calls, <HI>The Lu&s;ts of other things.</HI> But, what <HI>Lu&s;ts</HI> are the&s;e? There are the <HI>Lu&s;ts</HI> of <HI>Plea&s;ures</HI> that hinder Men from hearkening to the <HI>plea&s;ant Word</HI> of GOD; A <HI>Word &s;weeter than the Honey, and the Honey-Comb.</HI> We read in Luk. VIII. 14. of being, <HI>Choked with the plea&s;ures of this Life, and bringing of no Fruit unto perfection.</HI> The ways recommended in the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, are <HI>plea&s;ant ways.</HI> But the <HI>Plea&s;ures</HI> of the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> do prejudice and indi&s;po&s;e Men, to tho&s;e <HI>Narrow ways. Hearts</HI> that are <HI>fat as Grea&s;e</HI> with the <HI>Plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e,</HI> will be utterly <HI>&s;en&s;ele&s;s</HI> of every thing that the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD brings unto them. An <HI>Herod,</HI> will <HI>fear</HI> a <HI>Righteous</HI> and an <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly</HI> Evan|geli&s;t; and <HI>keep a watchful Eye over him,</HI> and <HI>having heard him he</HI> will be <HI>much perplexed, tho' he heard him peaceably,</HI> [This is the Account given of him, in a Tran&s;lation that &s;ome have cho&s;en of it:] Thus it will be, while he has an <HI>Herodias</HI> to en|tangle him. Again; There are the <HI>Lu&s;ts</HI> of <HI>Ho|nours,</HI> that hinder Men from <HI>Honouring</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, as they ought to do. Hence our Lord &s;aid; Joh. V. 44. <HI>How can ye believe, that receive Honour one of another, and &s;eek not the Honour that
<PB N="66" REF="002905_0071_0FE69170561624F0">cometh from GOD only?</HI> The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD calls for all po&s;&s;ible <HI>Honours</HI> to be paid unto the <HI>Son</HI> of GOD; Yea, That <HI>we Honour the Son as we Honour the Father.</HI> But it exacts many things from us, which according to our Carnal Notions of the matter, we fancy our <HI>Honours</HI> may be impaired by our Submi&s;&s;ion to. This <HI>Pride</HI> makes Men <HI>a&s;hamed</HI> of <HI>Confe&s;&s;ing</HI> a CHRIST <HI>before Men</HI> as the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD bids us to do. It <HI>hardens</HI> our Hearts: and makes us like tho&s;e <HI>Proud Men</HI> who told the Pro|phet, That <HI>they would not hearken to him.</HI></P>
<P>Once more; The Apo&s;tle has decided it; Jam. IV. 1. <HI>Whence come Wars and Fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your Lu&s;ts?</HI> There are the <HI>Lu&s;ts</HI> of <HI>Contention</HI> often getting Head among them that hear the Word of GOD: But then, The <HI>Contentions</HI> will <HI>not obey the Truth.</HI> No, but upon the <HI>Envying and Strife</HI> among them, there follows <HI>Confu&s;ion and every Evil work.</HI> Very fitly indeed may the&s; <HI>Lu&s;ts</HI> be called, <HI>Thorns:</HI> For, by the&s;e <HI>Lu&s;ts</HI> People keep &s;hamefully <HI>Tearing</HI> and <HI>Scratching</HI> one another. Now, 'tis a&s;toni&s;hing to to think, how much the <HI>Succe&s;s of the Go&s;pel</HI> is hin|dred, where a <HI>Spirit of Contention</HI> is got among a People. <HI>Satan</HI> knows what he does, when he throws in <HI>Bones of Contention</HI> among a People, which embroil them, and enrage them. In&s;tead of getting the <HI>Good</HI> that &s;hould be gotten by the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, their Thought and their Time, is taken up in doing of <HI>Hurt</HI> unto one another. The <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of GOD becomes as an <HI>Hou&s;e haunted with Evil Spirits.</HI> GOD withdraws from his <HI>Hou&s;e;</HI> yea, <HI>Abhors the Sanctuarp,</HI> and goes far from it.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="002905_0072_0FE6917197043A28">
The <HI>Grieved Spirit</HI> of GOD grievou&s;ly witholds His Influences from His Ordinances there. The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is meerly thrown away, among &s;uch a <HI>Thorny People.</HI> Indeed, Our SAVIOUR once appeared in a <HI>Thorn-Bu&s;h.</HI> But, When a Church once becomes a <HI>Thorn-Bu&s;h,</HI> embara&s;&s;ed with <HI>Contention,</HI> our Lord JESUS CHRIST will grant little appearance of him&s;elf, to ble&s;s his <HI>Word</HI> for the good of the People there.

<P N="2">II. But then, 'tis Time to hearken unto the <HI>Debortation;</HI> 1. Joh. II. 15. <HI>Love not the World, nei|ther the things that are in the World.</HI> Let not the <HI>Lu&s;ts of this World,</HI> hinder you from a <HI>Fruitful Hear|ing</HI> of that <HI>Word,</HI> which will <HI>&s;ave your Souls,</HI> if it be heard as it ought to be.</P>
<P>I will fetch a few &s;trokes of my <HI>Weeding-Hook,</HI> at the <HI>Lu&s;ts</HI> which threaten to <HI>Choak</HI> all Good in your Souls. Yea, Oh! That you could <HI>Quench them as the Fire of Thorns!</HI> But, <HI>In the Name of the Lord,</HI> I will try to <HI>de&s;troy them.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Remember This; It can't be <HI>long,</HI> that you &s;hall enjoy the Things of <HI>This World,</HI> after which your <HI>worldly Lu&s;ts</HI> do crave and rave and carry you out Importunately. This Brand is to be &s;et upon the&s;e Things; 1 Cor. VII. 29. <HI>This I &s;ay, The Time for them is but &s;hort.</HI> We know to
<PB N="72" REF="002905_0077_0FE691E1D69D17D0">whom they were in a <HI>Temptation</HI> all &s;hown, <HI>In a Moment of Time.</HI> If you had them all, <HI>In a Moment of Time,</HI> the <HI>Show</HI> will be over. And, <HI>Eye your Pot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> can feel the Thorns,</HI> in &s;o little a while, all the <HI>Light</HI> which the&s;e <HI>Thorns</HI> can yield you, 'tis, <HI>All Vani&s;h|ed! All</HI> come to <HI>nothing!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Remember This; While you Con|form to the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD your SAVIOUR, you &s;hall be &s;ure to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Things of <HI>This World,</HI> &s;o far as you have any occa&s;ion for them. You have His never-failing Engagement for it; Matth. VI. 33. <HI>Seek fir&s;t the Kingdom of GOD and His Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and all the&s;e things &s;hall be added unto you.</HI> Yield <HI>Obedience,</HI> and ca&s;t off all <HI>Diffidence,</HI> and make the <HI>Experiment: Prove me now, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> See whether you have not &s;uch a <HI>Competency</HI> of the&s;e Things, that you will have cau&s;e to, <HI>be content with &s;uch things as you have.</HI> The rather, becau&s;e you will have le&s;s <HI>Thorns</HI> in them, than what o|thers have: Your <HI>Little</HI> will be <HI>better</HI> to you, than the <HI>Riches</HI> of <HI>many wicked,</HI> who have but multipli|ed <HI>Thorns</HI> unto them&s;elves in all that they have gotten.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Remember This; If the <HI>Thorns</HI> of <HI>this World,</HI> render you <HI>Children of Di&s;obedience</HI> under the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD your SAVIOUR, you will at la&s;t &s;uffer De&s;truction like <HI>Thorns,</HI> in the <HI>Fire</HI> of His Indignation. It is a Marvellous Word, 2 Sam. XXIII. 67. <HI>They &s;hall be all of them as Thorns thru&s;t away; and they &s;hall be utterly burut with Fire id the Sabbath:</HI> So 'tis to be rendred: That is to &s;ay, At the coming of the Lord, in <HI>Flaming Fire,</HI> to bring on the Great <HI>Sabbati&s;m,</HI> that <HI>remains for the People of GOD.</HI> Oh! Let not your <HI>Hearts</HI> be
<PB N="73" REF="002905_0078_0FE691E1F4585078">full of <HI>Thorns,</HI> in the <HI>Sabbath</HI> which is now vouch|&s;afed unto us; le&s;t in that <HI>Sabbath</HI> you mu&s;t have an Expectation of a <HI>Fiery Indignation</HI> to <HI>devour</HI> you. If the <HI>Earth</HI> bear <HI>Thorns</HI> and <HI>Briars,</HI> it is <HI>Re|jected and nigh unto Cur&s;ing,</HI> and the <HI>End</HI> of the Wicked ones, who are them&s;elves but <HI>Thorns</HI> and <HI>Briars,</HI> will be, <HI>To be Burned.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>What &s;hall we do to be &s;aved,</HI> from the <HI>Thorns,</HI> and from the <HI>Fate</HI> and <HI>Fire</HI> of the <HI>Thorns?</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Prayer,</HI> our <HI>Prayer,</HI> unto our GOD; and with an Eye unto a SAVIOUR, who once wore a <HI>Crown of Thorns</HI> for us; This is the Fir&s;t Thing that is called for. Beg it of Him, That for the &s;ake of <HI>tho&s;e Thorns,</HI> you may be delivered from the&s;e <HI>Thorns.</HI> Cry to Him; <HI>Lord, Save me from the Lu&s;ts of a worldly Heart! Lord, Let not the Things of this World, hinder the good Effects of thy Word upon us!</HI></P>
<P>But more particularly pray, That the <HI>Thorns</HI> of <HI>Affliction,</HI> by which <HI>this World</HI> is Embittered, may be <HI>&s;anctified,</HI> for our being thereby made more Conformable to the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD. Our GOD is <HI>Teaching us by the Thorns of the Wilderne&s;s,</HI> what it is to <HI>Sin</HI> again&s;t Him. The Language of the&s;e <HI>Thorns</HI> is, <HI>Know and &s;ee, that it is an evil Thing, and a bitter, that thou ha&s;t for&s;aken the Lord thy GOD.</HI> Let the&s;e <HI>Thorns</HI> awaken us to mourn for our <HI>Sin;</HI> and, let it <HI>reach to our Heart,</HI> when we feel what our <HI>Way</HI> and our <HI>Doings</HI> have <HI>procured</HI> unto us. By our Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and our Confinements, our GOD is <HI>Hedging up our way with Thorns.</HI> Let us not be <HI>Angry</HI> at the <HI>Hedge,</HI> but even <HI>Thankful</HI> for it; And <HI>prick'd</HI> by the <HI>Thorns,</HI> let <HI>All the Fruit be, to take a|way our Sin,</HI> and bring us to &s;ay, <HI>I will not offend any more.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="002905_0079_0FE69179D180CA08">
Being &s;o much among the <HI>Thorns,</HI> Oh! May we be as <HI>Lillies among the Thorns,</HI> in regard of our PIETY flouri&s;hing in the mid&s;t of our Calamities.

<P>And Finally; What can we now do &s;o Rea|&s;onably, as long for the <HI>Second Adam</HI>'s World, which will have no <HI>Thorns</HI> to incommode it! <HI>Come, Lord JESUS, come quickly!</HI></P>
<P>&para; We have &s;een Three &s;orts of <HI>Bad Ground</HI> all <HI>&s;own</HI> with that <HI>Good Seed,</HI> which we have in the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD our SAVIOUR di&s;pen&s;ed unto us.

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The <HI>Good Ground.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We are informed, La&s;tly; That &s;ome who hear the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, prove a <HI>Good Ground,</HI> when the <HI>Seed</HI> is ca&s;t upon it. And as there were <HI>Three Spe|cies</HI> of the <HI>Bad Ground,</HI> &s;o there are <HI>Three Degrees</HI> of the <HI>Good.</HI> All the <HI>Good Ground,</HI> has this Report
<PB N="75" REF="002905_0080_0FE6917FDF771978">given of it; <HI>They hear the Word, and receive it, and bring forth Fruit.</HI> But then the <HI>Fruit</HI> of &s;ome is more than the <HI>Fruit</HI> of others; Our SAVIOUR thus proportions it; <HI>Some Thirty-fold, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me Sixty, and &s;ome an Hundred.</HI></P>
<P>And this is the <HI>Admonition,</HI> from it, which, I hope, will find many <HI>Fruitful Hearers</HI> among you.</P>
<P><HI>The Good Hearers of the Go&s;pel, tho' they are not all a|like Fruitful, yet they all bring forth &s;ome good Fruit; Yea, they both Increa&s;e and Per&s;i&s;t in their do|ing &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis a <HI>Bread of Propo&s;itions,</HI> that is now to be &s;et. before you on the <HI>Table</HI> in the Hou&s;e of our GOD. The <HI>Bread</HI> made, of the <HI>Corn</HI> in the <HI>Good Ground,</HI> is to be Exhibited in the en&s;uing <HI>Propo&s;itions.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. There are &s;ome <HI>Good Hearers,</HI> among tho&s;e whom the <HI>Good Seed</HI> of the Go&s;pel falls upon. It would be &s;ad indeed if it &s;hould not be &s;o! The&s;e <HI>Good Hearers</HI> are they of whom our SAVIOUR &s;ays, Luk. VIII. 15. They have a <HI>Good Heart</HI> in the <HI>Hearing</HI> of it. It were to be <HI>wi&s;hed,</HI> that <HI>All</HI> the <HI>Ground,</HI> which has the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD ca&s;t up|on it, were <HI>Good Ground.</HI> But this is a Thing more to be <HI>wi&s;hed</HI> for, than to be <HI>hoped</HI> for. However, &s;ome of the <HI>Ground</HI> is <HI>Good.</HI> And, <HI>How comes this to pa&s;s?</HI> Truly, The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD our SAVI|OUR, falls not upon any <HI>Heart</HI> that is <HI>Good</HI> before the <HI>Word</HI> fir&s;t falls upon it. There is no <HI>Good Heart</HI> in any Hearer of the <HI>Word,</HI> until the <HI>Word</HI> it&s;elf makes it &s;o. <HI>Wo</HI> would be unto us, we &s;hould be Damned unto <HI>Eternal</HI> Wickedne&s;s and Barren|ne&s;s;
<PB N="76" REF="002905_0081_0FE6917FFA588DD0">if the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD &s;hould never <HI>do Good</HI> unto us, until we bring a <HI>Good Heart</HI> unto it. Every Man has in him, <HI>An Evil Heart of Unbelief depart|ing from the living GOD;</HI> And no Man can give unto him&s;elf a <HI>Better Heart;</HI> Such and none but &s;uch, an <HI>Heart</HI> it is, that we do <HI>at fir&s;t</HI> bring unto the <HI>Good Word</HI> of our GOD. We read, Mic. II. 7. <HI>Do not my Words do good unto him that walks up|rightly?</HI> If the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD &s;hould never <HI>do Good</HI> unto any, until they do <HI>walk uprightly,</HI> it would never <HI>do Good</HI> unto any at all! But it <HI>fir&s;t of all</HI> does this <HI>Good</HI> unto us; It makes us <HI>upright,</HI> thro' a <HI>Change</HI> of <HI>Heart</HI> produced in us; and it Inclines us and Excites us to <HI>walk uprightly;</HI> And <HI>Then</HI> fol|lows all the other <HI>Good,</HI> which is received from it by them that <HI>walk uprightly.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if we Enquire, What are the Characters of a <HI>Good Heart</HI> under the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD our SA|VIOUR, Behold, our SAVIOUR him&s;elf will &s;oon &s;atisfy that Enquiry.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. A <HI>Good Heart</HI> hearing the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, hears it with <HI>Under&s;tanding.</HI> So our SAVIOUR explains it; Mat. XIII. 23. <HI>He that received Seed into the good Ground, is he that heareth the Word, and under&s;tandeth it.</HI> When the Di&s;ciples of our Lord, heard his <HI>Word</HI> with a <HI>Good Heart, He &s;aid unto them, Have ye under&s;tood all tho&s;e things? They &s;ay unto Him, Yea, Lord.</HI> We are truly told; Prov. XIX. 2. <HI>That the Soul be without Knowledge, it is not good.</HI> Be &s;ure, It is not a <HI>good Heart,</HI> that is <HI>without the Knowledge</HI> of tho&s;e Things, which <HI>to know, is Life Eternal.</HI> When you hear, <HI>who</HI> your SAVIOUR is; What are your <HI>Wants</HI> of Him; What He <HI>has done</HI> for us; What He <HI>will do</HI> for us; And, what
<PB N="77" REF="002905_0082_0FE6918166E250B0">He will have <HI>to be done</HI> by us; Then, as <HI>Philip</HI> asked the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Trea&s;urer, <HI>Under&s;tande&s;t thou what thou Reade&s;t?</HI> Thus we are to ask our&s;elves, <HI>Do I under&s;tand what I hear?</HI> If we don't <HI>under&s;tand</HI> &s;omething of tho&s;e points, our <HI>Ignorance</HI> will prove <HI>the Mother of De&s;truction</HI> unto us. Yea, Being a <HI>People of no under&s;tanding,</HI> He that <HI>made us will not have Mercy on us.</HI></P>
<P>But then, Secondly; A <HI>Good Heart</HI> hearing the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, hears it with <HI>Affection.</HI> So our SAVIOUR explains it; Mat. IV. 20. <HI>They Hear the Word and Receive it.</HI> We then hear the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD with a <HI>Good Heart,</HI> when we give a good <HI>Reception</HI> to it. A good <HI>Reception</HI> to it, implies a good <HI>Affection</HI> to it. It is the mark of a <HI>Good Heart,</HI> when the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is a <HI>Good Word</HI> unto it. Such a <HI>Good Heart</HI> will &s;ay; I&s;a. XXXIX. 8. <HI>Good is the Word of the Lord.</HI> Yea, the <HI>De&s;ire</HI> of &s;uch an <HI>Heart</HI> (which is <HI>only good</HI>) runs out in &s;uch Terms as tho&s;e, <HI>Lord, Thou art Good, and thou do&s;t Good; O Teach me thy Statutes.</HI> A <HI>Good Heart,</HI> hearing the <HI>Commandments</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>This Word is very pure, and therefore, O Lord, thy Servant loveth it.</HI> Hearing the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> it &s;ays, <HI>I rejoyce in the&s;e Te&s;timonies more than in all Riches.</HI> Hearing the <HI>Threatenings</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> it &s;ays, <HI>Lord, I am afraid of the&s;e Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>More than this; Thirdly. A <HI>Good Heart</HI> hear|ing the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, hears it with <HI>Retention.</HI> So our SAVIOUR explains it; Luk. VIII. 15. <HI>Hav|ing heard the Word, they keep it.</HI> It is a <HI>Good Heart,</HI> in which the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, is <HI>kept,</HI> as it forever de&s;erves to be; and laid up, as the <HI>Book of the Law</HI> was in the <HI>Ark</HI> of old. The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD mu&s;t
<PB N="78" REF="002905_0083_0FE691E9C02F39D8">be laid up, as an Invaluable <HI>Trea&s;ure</HI> there. A Man of a <HI>good Heart,</HI> may &s;ay, with Him; P&s;al. CXIX. 11. <HI>I have hid thy word in my Heart.</HI> In a <HI>good Heart,</HI> the <HI>Memory</HI> becomes a <HI>Store-hou&s;e</HI> for the <HI>word</HI> of GOD. The <HI>Evangelized</HI> Soul, &s;ays, <HI>I will not forget thy word;</HI> and it <HI>gives earne&s;t heed un|to the things which it hears, le&s;t at any time it may let them &s;lip;</HI> and lo&s;e them, in their <HI>leaking</HI> from it.</P>
<P>Fourthly, and Finally. What is a <HI>good Heart,</HI> but an <HI>hone&s;t Heart?</HI> So tis explained; Luk. VIII. 15. <HI>An hone&s;t and a good Heart.</HI> The Term <HI>Hone&s;t,</HI> is as much as to &s;ay, <HI>Beautiful.</HI> There is a <HI>Beauty</HI> in <HI>Religion;</HI> and particularly tho&s;e <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> wherein we deal Ju&s;tly, Kindly, and Fairly with our Neighbours; The&s;e have a <HI>Beauty</HI> in them. An <HI>Heart</HI> &s;incerely Religious, is an <HI>Hone&s;t,</HI> that is to &s;ay, a <HI>Beautiful Heart.</HI> The Glorious GOD <HI>looks down from Heaven, and beholds from the habita|tion of his Holine&s;s and of his Glory,</HI> and with Delight He &s;ees His own <HI>Beautiful Image</HI> upon it. But mo&s;t particularly, Tis an <HI>Heart</HI> loth to wrong or hurt any Man in the World, and an <HI>Heart</HI> &s;et upon do|ing all the Good that ever he can, to all that are about us. This is a <HI>Good Heart,</HI> and there is that <HI>Beauty</HI> in &s;uch an <HI>Heart,</HI> that all the World will a|gree to call <HI>Good.</HI> We are to have &s;uch an <HI>Heart</HI> as this, in <HI>hearing</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> of our GOD.</P>
<P>But, <HI>What &s;hall I do to get &s;uch an Heart?</HI> The An&s;wer is, Come to the <HI>Word</HI> For &s;uch an <HI>Heart,</HI> when you cannot come <HI>with</HI> it. And therewithal, come to the <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> who is the Giv|er of &s;uch an <HI>Heart.</HI> Chri&s;tian, Addre&s;s thy SA|VIOUR, with &s;uch a Petition as That; P&s;al. LI. 10.
<PB N="79" REF="002905_0084_0FE691818768F518"><HI>Create in me a clean Heart, O GOD.</HI> Thy SA|VIOUR demands, <HI>Give me thy Heart.</HI> Bring it unto Him, and beg of Him, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, My Heart is a Blind Heart, and a Ba&s;e Heart, and an Heart that is de&s;perately wicked; But &s;uch an Heart as it is, I humbly lay it before thee. Oh! Do thou take it, and make a good Heart of it, and then I &s;hall in an acceptable manner give my Heart unto thee.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. All the <HI>Good Hearers</HI> of the Go&s;pel, are <HI>Fruit|ful</HI> ones. There will be upon every <HI>Good Hearer</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> tho&s;e Laudable Things, wherein it may be &s;aid, He <HI>bears Fruit.</HI> If a Man &s;it under the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, and bring forth no <HI>Fruit</HI> of it, what &s;ort of a <HI>Ground</HI> is that Man? We are told, Heb. VI. 8. <HI>It is Rejected, nigh unto Cur&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>The Que&s;tion here to be thought upon, is; <HI>What is that Fruit, by which the Good Hearers of the Go&s;pel, are di&s;tingui&s;hed?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fruit,</HI> in general, is, The <HI>Good Effect</HI> of the Go&s;|pel upon us. Of &s;ome we read, Col. I. 6. <HI>The Word of the Truth of the Go&s;pel brings forth Fruit in them.</HI> This is, when we Glorify GOD our SA|VIOUR, with &s;uch a <HI>Faith,</HI> and &s;uch a <HI>Repentance,</HI> and &s;uch a <HI>Purity,</HI> as the Go&s;pel does oblige us to. A <HI>Good Hearer</HI> of the Go&s;pel, brings forth &s;uch <HI>Fruit</HI> as This; That the <HI>Go&s;pel of the Grace of God</HI> effectually <HI>teaches</HI> him to <HI>deny all Ungodline&s;s and worldly Lu&s;ts, and live Godlily, and Soberly, and Righ|teou&s;ly in this pre&s;ent world.</HI></P>
<P>O our Hearers; <HI>Hearken and Behold!</HI> The <HI>Good Fruit,</HI> expected from the <HI>Good Seed,</HI> which in your hearing the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD there is ca&s;t upon you, mu&s;t be &s;een in &s;uch Things as the&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="002905_0085_0FE6918866100C90">
There mu&s;t be this <HI>Good Fruit</HI> of what you <HI>hear;</HI> That you mu&s;t carry your peri&s;hing Souls unto your Mighty and Only SAVIOUR, Be&s;eeching of Him, and Relying on Him, to <HI>Reconcile</HI> you unto GOD: Con&s;enting, That He &s;hould by His infinite <HI>Merit</HI> bring you into <HI>Peace</HI> with GOD, and by His Almighty <HI>Spirit</HI> work in you that which is <HI>well plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of GOD.</HI></P>

Every Day <HI>be in the Fear of the Lord all the Day long;</HI> Every where <HI>do as you would be done unto.</HI></P>
<P>Here is <HI>Good Fruit.</HI> O Soul having &s;uch <HI>Fruit</HI> as this found upon thee, <HI>Come near</HI> unto thy SA|VIOUR, and receive a <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> from Him; and hear Him &s;aying, <HI>See, the Smell of this fruitful Soul, is as the Smell of a Field which the Lord hath ble&s;|&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>Syrs, You can't be owned as <HI>Good Hearers</HI> of the Go&s;pel, if you are not the <HI>Better</HI> for it; more <HI>Ac|quainted</HI>

<P N="3">III. Tho' all the <HI>Good Hearers</HI> of the Go&s;pel, mu&s;t be <HI>Really Fruitful,</HI> yet they are not <HI>Equally</HI> &s;o. We read, <HI>They bring forth, &s;ome Thirty fold, &s;ome Sixty, &s;ome an Hundred.</HI> Our SAVIOUR made His Allu&s;ion to the <HI>Grain</HI> then mo&s;t u&s;ual in that Countrey.

And in this, every <HI>Soil</HI> is not alike <HI>Fertile;</HI> does not yield <HI>alike.</HI> I take notice, that in one Evangeli&s;t, there is no mention of the <HI>Thirty fold,</HI> and the <HI>Sixty fold</HI> produce. It is only &s;aid, Luk. VIII. 8. <HI>The Good Ground bare Fruit an Hundred fold.</HI> This may be to note, That tho' this <HI>Uttermo&s;t Fruitfulne&s;s,</HI> be not the <HI>Attainment,</HI> yet it is the <HI>Endeavour</HI> of every Godly Man: And our Good GOD makes a gra|cious Con&s;truction of the <HI>Endeavour,</HI> and <HI>Accepts the willing Mind.</HI> The <HI>Endeavour</HI> of every Godly Man, in Hearing the <HI>Word,</HI> is to bring forth as much <HI>Fruit,</HI> as the mo&s;t <HI>Fruitful Saint</HI> that ever lived. He does not <HI>&s;tint</HI> him&s;elf, as to the <HI>Fruit</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> upon him. He can &s;ay of the <HI>utter|mo&s;t Fruitfulne&s;s;</HI> as in Phil. III. 14. <HI>I pre&s;s toward
<PB N="82" REF="002905_0087_0FE691EB98AE3108">the Mark.</HI> Yea, But this, even the <HI>Hundred fold,</HI> is not the <HI>Attainment</HI> of every Godly Man. There is as much Difference between the <HI>Fruits</HI> found in the <HI>Good Hearers</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> as between <HI>Thirty</HI> and an <HI>Hundred.</HI> Some good Men are not one Third part &s;o <HI>Fruitful</HI> as others are. As we read, 1 Cor. XV. 41. <HI>One Star differs from another Star in Glory:</HI> So, <HI>One Saint</HI> al&s;o differs from <HI>another Saint</HI> in <HI>Glory.</HI> 'Tis our <HI>Fruitfulne&s;s</HI> that is our <HI>Glory.</HI> Our <HI>David</HI> has many <HI>Worthies;</HI> But there is a <HI>Fir&s;t Three,</HI> which all do not come up unto.</P>
<P>Indeed, the <HI>Good Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> is not <HI>Alike</HI> di&s;pen&s;ed among the People of GOD. The <HI>Or|dinances</HI> in &s;ome Churches, are admini&s;tred with more <HI>Light,</HI> and with more <HI>Warmth,</HI> and with more Heavenly Operations than they are in others. It may be Expected, that the <HI>Fruit</HI> will be propor|tionable. And yet, among tho&s;e who enjoy the &s;ame Admini&s;trations, all the truly <HI>Pious</HI> do not bear <HI>Fruit</HI> in a like proportion; and are not of e|qual <HI>Piety.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t. The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD it &s;elf, a&s;&s;ures and a&s;&s;igns a <HI>Difference,</HI> among them that are the <HI>Good Hearers</HI> of the <HI>Word.</HI> Thus we find &s;everal Cla&s;|&s;es in the <HI>School</HI> of our SAVIOUR. We find, 1. Joh. II. 13. <HI>Fathers,</HI> and <HI>Young Men,</HI> and <HI>little Children;</HI> We find, 1. Cor. III. 1. Some that are <HI>Spiritual;</HI> others that are <HI>Carnal,</HI> and <HI>Babes in Chri&s;t.</HI> We find, Rom. XV. 1. Some that are <HI>Strong;</HI> others that are <HI>Weak,</HI> and have their <HI>Infirmities.</HI> Hence we find, that &s;ome <HI>Hearers</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> are <HI>perfect</HI> ones, in compari&s;on of others that yet are not in a &s;tate of Wickedne&s;s. We read, Jam. III. 2. <HI>If any Man offend not in Word, the &s;ame is a perfect
<PB N="83" REF="002905_0088_0FE691EBB56D75B0">Man.</HI> It means not, that he is <HI>Ab&s;olutely perfect,</HI> but that he is in the <HI>Highe&s;t Form</HI> of Chri&s;tianity. The Man who rarely, if ever, lets fall a <HI>Word,</HI> that another Man may have cau&s;e to blame him for, is this <HI>perfect Man.</HI> Yea, we find &s;ome that are <HI>None-&s;uch</HI> ones; and are &s;o applauded, <HI>Many have done virtuou&s;ly, but thou excelle&s;t them all.</HI> So we read of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> 2. King. XVIII. 5. <HI>There was none like him.</HI> So we read of <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> 2. King. XXIII. <HI>Like unto him there was none.</HI> So we read of <HI>Timothy;</HI> Phil. II. 20. <HI>No Man like-minded.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, In the <HI>Fruits</HI> of <HI>Knowledge,</HI> all the <HI>Really Fruitful,</HI> are not <HI>equally</HI> &s;o. No; We read, Heb. V. 12. Of &s;ome, that may be <HI>Teachers;</HI> and of o|thers, that need one to <HI>Teach</HI> them the <HI>fir&s;t Princi|ples</HI> of the <HI>Oracles of GOD:</HI> Of &s;ome that are <HI>of full age,</HI> and have <HI>&s;trong Meat belonging</HI> unto them; and of others that <HI>u&s;e Milk,</HI> and are <HI>unskilful in the Word of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Fruits</HI> of a True <HI>Faith;</HI> &s;ome can have it &s;aid of them, <HI>I have not found &s;o great Faith, no not in I&s;rael.</HI> To others it may be &s;aid, <HI>O ye of little Faith.</HI> In the <HI>Fruits</HI> of a True <HI>Love,</HI> &s;ome can have it &s;aid of them, <HI>They have loved much.</HI> To others it may be &s;aid, <HI>Thou ha&s;t not the Fir&s;t Love.</HI> In points of <HI>Holy Living,</HI> it may be &s;aid of &s;ome, <HI>They do that which is Right in the &s;ight of the Lord, yet not like David;</HI> nor like a Man wholly <HI>after the Heart of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Some <HI>Good Hearers</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> are de&s;igned of Heaven to be prepared by the <HI>Word,</HI> for Greater, Higher, Nobler <HI>Services</HI> than others are. Of one that was to have a <HI>Charge over Jeru|&s;alem,</HI> we read, Neh. VII. 2. <HI>He was a faithful
<PB N="84" REF="002905_0089_0FE69188856D2130">Man, and feared GOD above many.</HI> GOD intends the&s;e and tho&s;e for <HI>&s;ingular Services;</HI> and &s;o he will make them <HI>Fruitful Men above many,</HI> and &s;uch as his <HI>Word</HI> &s;hall bring to more of his <HI>Fear,</HI> than ma|ny are brought unto. There are &s;ome, who are like <HI>Paul,</HI> to do more for GOD in a way of <HI>Active Obedience,</HI> than others. There are &s;ome, who are like <HI>Job,</HI> to do more than others for GOD in a way of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive</HI> Obedience. Now, &s;uch as the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD &s;hall do but little good upon, the&s;e will not be furni&s;hed for what he will have &s;ome be call'd unto. There mu&s;t be &s;ome who &s;hall <HI>Excell</HI> in <HI>Fruitfulne&s;s,</HI> becau&s;e of &s;ome <HI>Excellent Work,</HI> which GOD has intended for them.</P>
<P N="4">IV. All the truiy <HI>Fruitful Hearers</HI> of the Go&s;pel, will <HI>Increa&s;e</HI> in their <HI>Fruitfulne&s;s.</HI> Concerning the <HI>Fruit</HI> on the <HI>Good Ground,</HI> we read, Mar. IV. 8. <HI>It &s;prang up, and Increa&s;ed.</HI> That <HI>Obedience</HI> to GOD, which his <HI>Word</HI> brings any Per&s;on to, will certain|ly be a <HI>growing Obedience,</HI> and they that are in it will <HI>Wax &s;tronger and &s;tronger.</HI> If there be no <HI>Growth</HI> in our PIETY, we may &s;u&s;pect the <HI>Truth</HI> of our PIETY. We find, Joh. XV. 2. <HI>That which bears Fruit,</HI> mu&s;t and will <HI>bring forth more Fruit.</HI> When we fir&s;t begin to bring forth <HI>Fruit</HI> unto GOD, there is as the Apo&s;tle &s;aid unto &s;ome of old, <HI>Something lacking in it.</HI> But our GOD will have it Proceed, and Improve, and <HI>Increa&s;e</HI> to fur|ther Degrees; It &s;hall &s;ee an <HI>Increa&s;ing of GOD.</HI> A <HI>Sincere</HI> and <HI>New-born</HI> and <HI>Living</HI> Child of GOD, will be a <HI>Growing</HI> one. Of the <HI>Faithful</HI> and the <HI>Fruitful,</HI> we read, Ho&s;. XIV. 5. <HI>He &s;hall grow as the Lilly;</HI> of which they &s;ay, It <HI>grows</HI> as long as it
<PB N="85" REF="002905_0090_0FE69189A5E9C3C8"><HI>lives.</HI> If we be <HI>Rooted</HI> in Him, who is our GOD and our Life, His Intere&s;t will be continually <HI>Growing</HI> in us.</P>
<P>O Hearer of the <HI>Word,</HI> come under a <HI>Trial</HI> that is now to be pa&s;&s;ed upon thee.</P>
<P>If thou art a <HI>Fruitful Hearer</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> thou wilt be upon the <HI>Increa&s;e</HI> in thy <HI>Fruitfulne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Fruitful Hearer</HI> of the Word, will <HI>Increa&s;e</HI> in his <HI>Acquaintance</HI> with the Glorious CHRIST, who is the very <HI>Sum</HI> of all the <HI>Word.</HI> It is requi|red, 2. Pet. III. 18. <HI>Grow in the Grace and Know|ledge of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> He &s;ees more and more <HI>Glory</HI> in a lovely JESUS; <HI>How great his Goodne&s;s and his Beauty!</HI> He has more and more &s;en&s;e of the <HI>Mi&s;eries,</HI> which without a CHRIST he lies expo&s;ed unto: And he becomes more and more &s;en&s;ible of the <HI>Al&s;ufficiency</HI> in a CHRIST for the Relief of all his <HI>Mi&s;eries.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Fruitful Hearer</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> will <HI>Increa&s;e</HI> in his <HI>Ability</HI> to Repel <HI>Temptations</HI> to Sin again&s;t the <HI>Word.</HI> The <HI>Devil</HI> can't &s;o <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> prevail upon him, as once he could. He can more <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> Deny him|&s;elf of tho&s;e <HI>Plea&s;ures</HI> and <HI>Profits</HI> and <HI>Honours</HI> with which the <HI>Devil</HI> allures Men into Folly. The Variety of <HI>Conditions</HI> thro' which he pa&s;&s;es; he more <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> bears them, and more <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> avoids the Errors incident unto them, He is le&s;s enchanted with <HI>Pro&s;perity:</HI> It proves not &s;uch a <HI>Dalilah,</HI> to lay him a&s;leep in &s;inful &s;tupefactions. He is le&s;s di&s;turbed with <HI>Adver&s;ity:</HI> He gains in the <HI>&s;trength</HI> which keeps him from <HI>Fainting</HI> in the <HI>Day</HI> of it.</P>
<P>A <HI>Fruitful Hearer</HI> of the Word, will <HI>Increa&s;e</HI> in his awful Re&s;entments of the <HI>Everla&s;ting Invi&s;ibles,</HI> whereof we are advi&s;ed in the <HI>Word.</HI> He becomes
<PB N="86" REF="002905_0091_0FE69189C62DECA8">more Awed by the Apprehen&s;ion of <HI>GOD knowing the way that he takes.</HI> He becomes more afraid of <HI>Grieving the Holy SPIRIT of GOD,</HI> by any Mi&s;car|riages. He becomes more lothe to di&s;oblige the <HI>Good Angels,</HI> and gratify the <HI>Evil</HI> ones, by any Mi&s;behaviours. He is more Swayed by the Hopes of the great Recompence, in the <HI>&s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> of the <HI>Heavenly places;</HI> and he is more affected with <HI>the Terror of the Lord;</HI> a <HI>De&s;truction from GOD</HI> is more of a <HI>Terror</HI> unto him.</P>
<P>Finally. A <HI>Fruitful Hearer</HI> of the Word, will <HI>Increa&s;e</HI> in the <HI>Conformity</HI> of his whole <HI>Conver&s;ation</HI> to the <HI>Word.</HI> He becomes more full of <HI>Meditati|ons</HI> on <HI>Things pertaining to the Kingdom of GOD:</HI> More frequent, and more fervent in <HI>Supplications</HI> to the <HI>Throne of Grace.</HI> He becomes a greater <HI>Sa|crificer;</HI> and more abounding in the <HI>Sacrifices</HI> which <HI>GOD is well-plea&s;ed withal.</HI> He makes notable Ad|vances, in a <HI>Clean&s;ing from all Filthine&s;s of the Fle&s;h and of the Spirit;</HI> and carrying on <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> towards <HI>Perfection in the fear of GOD.</HI> The <HI>Sanctification</HI> of his <HI>whole,</HI> ever. <HI>Spirit, and Soul, and Body,</HI> is carried on, thro' <HI>the pre&s;ence of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Hearken, <HI>O Hearers</HI> of the <HI>Word:</HI> A <HI>Non-profi|ciency</HI> under the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD; Oh! 'Twould be a Black Token of <HI>Death</HI> upon you!</P>
<P N="5">V. We cannot be <HI>Fruitful Hearers</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> except we al&s;o <HI>per&s;i&s;t</HI> in our <HI>Fruitfulne&s;s.</HI> Of the Hearers who are <HI>Good Ground,</HI> we read; Luk. VIII. 15. <HI>They bring forth Fruit with Patience.</HI></P>
<P>But, what is intended in this <HI>Patience?</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t; There is no <HI>Fruitful Hearer</HI> of the Word, but what &s;hall be <HI>Tried</HI> by &s;ome <HI>Affliction,</HI> whether he will continue to bring forth <HI>Fruit,</HI> or no; And
<PB N="87" REF="002905_0092_0FE691F30AC6F8E0">be <HI>Tried</HI> what <HI>Fruit</HI> it is, that he does bring forth unto GOD. There is no Di&s;ciple of the Lord who died on the <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> but what has a <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> pro|vided for him. The fir&s;t <HI>Maxim</HI> that our Lord lays down for every Di&s;ciple, is, Mat. XVI. 24. <HI>Let him deny him&s;elf, and take up his Cro&s;s, and follow me. Patience</HI> is a Vertue di&s;po&s;ing us to Love, and Serve, and Obey, our SAVIOUR under the <HI>Cro&s;s.</HI> There is no <HI>Fruitfulne&s;s</HI> without &s;ome <HI>Affliction:</HI> Indeed, with the Cho&s;en of GOD, the more <HI>Af|fliction,</HI> the more <HI>Fruitfulne&s;s.</HI> The Name of the Believer, is <HI>Ephraim;</HI> Ina&s;much as GOD makes him <HI>Fruitful in the Land of his Affliction.</HI> Where|fore, we are to <HI>Run with Patience,</HI> thro' all that is <HI>before us.</HI> Look for it, O Believer; Look for <HI>Af|fliction</HI> to try thy <HI>Patience.</HI> And let this be taken, as one Intimation here doubtle&s;s given by our SA|VIOUR; A Man may not be e&s;teemed a <HI>Fruitful</HI> Man, until he be a <HI>Patient</HI> one. You mu&s;t be People <HI>of Sorrows and acquainted with Griefs:</HI> You mu&s;t meet with <HI>Bereavements,</HI> meet with <HI>Injuries,</HI> meet with <HI>Reproaches:</HI> As being under a <HI>Crucifixi|on,</HI> you mu&s;t &s;uffer one Dolorous <HI>Pang</HI> after ano|ther, and &s;uffer &s;uch a <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> of them, that one &s;hall no &s;ooner be a little over, but another will come on; until the <HI>Mercy&s;troke</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> open an Outgate for you. Now, How do you <HI>Bear</HI> the&s;e Things? If you Bear them with <HI>Patience,</HI> then you <HI>Bear Fruit with Patience.</HI> Man, If thou ha&s;t a <HI>Froward</HI> Soul, thou ha&s;t not a <HI>Fruitful</HI> one!</P>
<P>Secondly. Nor was any one ever a <HI>Fruitful Hearer</HI> of the Word, but &s;uch as did continue to bring forth <HI>Fruit</HI> unto the end. As we are told, P&s;al. XCII. 11. <HI>They &s;hall &s;till bring forth Fruit in
<PB N="88" REF="002905_0093_0FE69191C550A820">old Age.</HI> Even &s;o, <HI>They &s;hall &s;till bring forth Fruit until the very Period of their Lives.</HI> The <HI>Harve&s;t</HI> of that <HI>Fruit</HI> which we are to yield, will not come, until the World to come. With <HI>Patience</HI> then, we mu&s;t hold on, and hold out, yielding <HI>Fruit</HI> as long as we are in this World. <HI>Per&s;everance; Per&s;eve|rance!</HI> This is that <HI>Patience,</HI> with which we are to <HI>bring forth Fruit</HI> unto GOD. An <HI>Apo&s;tate</HI> Sinner, was always an <HI>Unfruitful</HI> Sinner. The <HI>Good Fruits</HI> of &s;uch an one, were never any other than meer <HI>Shows</HI> of Good. Soul, Ha&s;t thou Begun to be <HI>Fruitful?</HI> O Tremble at a <HI>Degeneracy</HI> from hopeful Beginnings. If thy <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> be what &s;oon <HI>pa&s;&s;eth away,</HI> the Glorious GOD, as in a Deliberation what Vengeance to take upon it, &s;ays, <HI>What &s;hall I do unto thee? What &s;hall I do unto thee?</HI> It is a Terrible Thing that He will <HI>do unto thee.</HI></P>
<P>And now, We are come to, <HI>The Conclu&s;ion of the Matter.</HI></P>
<P>You are now determined, What is the <HI>Good Soil,</HI> and that which alone may look for <HI>Good,</HI> and will come to <HI>Good,</HI> and which <HI>brings forth Fruits meet</HI> for the Cultivation u&s;ed upon it, and <HI>receiveth Ble&s;&s;ing from GOD.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>De&s;irable Thing</HI> whereto you are now to be Exhorted, is This; Oh! Become &s;ollicitous, that you may under the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, be as the <HI>Good Ground, Fruitful</HI> from the <HI>Seed</HI> ca&s;t upon it; Become Importunate for the <HI>Good Heart</HI> which may make you and prove you to be &s;uch <HI>Good Ground</HI> before the Lord.</P>
<P>In the pro&s;ecution of this EXHORTATION, there are three <HI>Coun&s;ils</HI> from GOD, yea, <HI>Charges,</HI> to be in the Name of GGD, earne&s;tly pre&s;s'd up|on you.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="002905_0094_0FE69191E025BC80">
Fir&s;t. <HI>Examine</HI> your &s;elves, O all you that are our <HI>Hearers,</HI> Examine your &s;elves, what <HI>Fruit</HI> the Go&s;pel has had with you; What <HI>Fruit</HI> you have heard the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD withal. The GOD of Heaven, who does require <HI>Fruit</HI> from the <HI>Soil,</HI> and the <HI>Soul,</HI> on which He has be&s;towed the <HI>Seed</HI> of His <HI>Word,</HI> He does al&s;o Enquire, what is the <HI>Fruit</HI> of all His Tillage. He &s;ays; Luk.

<P>There are e&s;pecially <HI>Four Que&s;tions</HI> which I ve|hemently urge you to Retire and ponder on.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. I <HI>Have I ever yet had Experience of a Re|generation from the Word of Truth? And has the Holy SPIRIT of GOD, by His Word &s;o Quickned me for Living to Him, and given &s;uch a New Bia&s;s to me, as to make a New Creature of me?</HI></P>

<P>Secondly.

Tis <HI>Faith</HI> which is to do all the&s;e <HI>Good Works,</HI> and yield all the&s;e <HI>Good Fruits.</HI> It mu&s;t be the <HI>Obedience of Faith,</HI> which does them all, yields them all. The <HI>Fir&s;t Thing</HI> to be propounded with you, is, To fly unto

<P>Thirdly; Be <HI>Prayerful</HI> that you may be <HI>Fruitful.</HI> Indeed, <HI>Prayer</HI> it &s;elf is no little part of the <HI>Fruit</HI> that is called for. <HI>Prayerle&s;s</HI> ones, be&s;ure are <HI>Fruit|le&s;s</HI> ones.

Our COMPANY will be a Thing of more than a little Con&s;equence to our PIETY. Our <HI>Fruitfulne&s;s</HI> in all the <HI>Good Works</HI> of PIETY, will very much depend on the <HI>Company</HI> with which we chu&s;e to be mo&s;t <HI>Familiar.</HI> A Grand Maxim of Wi&s;dom, and of the be&s;t <HI>Husbandry,</HI> is, <HI>For&s;ake the Fooli&s;h and live.</HI> We have read of one who&s;e <HI>Field</HI> was in a Bad Condition, He got it by being <HI>A|mong&s;t</HI> tho&s;e who were not as they &s;hould be.</P>
<P>For the Inculcation of this <HI>Caution,</HI> I will &s;et before you <HI>Two Laws,</HI> which the <HI>Holy One of I&s;rael</HI> gave to His People concerning the <HI>Ancient Hu&s;|bandry.</HI></P>
<P>One Law was; Deut. XXII. 10. <HI>Thou &s;halt not Plow with an Ox and an A&s;s together.</HI> The Con|junction of Animals that are of &s;o unequal a <HI>Na|ture</HI> and <HI>Size</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> was doubtle&s;s a <HI>Magical Rite,</HI> invented by the Devil to be u&s;ed by Men, in Token of their Dependence on him for <HI>Fruitful Fields.</HI> There can be no Rea&s;on but <HI>Magic</HI> found for &s;uch an improper <HI>Conjugation. Homer,</HI> and all the World, have decried the Non&s;en&s;e and Folly and <HI>Madne&s;s</HI> of it; and it was look'd upon as e|nough to proclaim <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> a <HI>Madman.</HI> But the Devil &s;ingularly delights in <HI>Confu&s;ion,</HI> and in all Contradiction to the <HI>GOD of Order.</HI> The <HI>Ox</HI> was a Sacrifice to the <HI>Dii Superi;</HI> the <HI>A&s;s,</HI> a Sacrifice to the <HI>Dii Inferi.</HI> Both &s;orts of Deities were <HI>Sa|cramentally</HI> called upon, when the&s;e were in the <HI>Yoke together.</HI></P>
<P>But, was there nothing el&s;e de&s;igned in forbid|ding this <HI>Diabolical Sacrament?</HI> The Jews in their <HI>Baal-Hatturin</HI> tell us, There was this thing My&s;|tically taught us in it, <HI>That the Righteous and the
<PB N="93" REF="002905_0098_0FE691938316D520">Wicked &s;hould avoid Commerce with one another.</HI> Yea, <HI>Bochart</HI> is of the Opinion, that our Apo&s;tle did allude unto this very <HI>Law,</HI> when he forbids our being <HI>unequally yoked with Unbelievers.</HI> Chri&s;tian, It will marvellou&s;ly creeple thee, to be <HI>yoked</HI> with <HI>Unbelievers,</HI> and with &s;uch as indeed will <HI>Draw a|nother way</HI> than what thy Soul tends unto.</P>
<P>Another Law was; Lev. XIX 19. <HI>Thou &s;halt not &s;ow thy Field, with a mingled Seed.</HI> No doubt, the Original of this Injunction was this; There was, as <HI>Maimonides</HI> tells us, a Super&s;tition of the <HI>Zabians,</HI> to &s;ow <HI>Barley</HI> and <HI>Rai&s;ins</HI> together, that they might procure to their <HI>Fields,</HI> a &s;ingular Pro&s;|perity and Felicity. Our <HI>Selden</HI> finds among the Old <HI>Athenians,</HI> what a little re&s;embles it. The old <HI>Idolaters</HI> joined a <HI>Male</HI> God, and a <HI>Female</HI> in their Acknowledgements. And <HI>Varro</HI> writing, <HI>De Re Ru&s;tica,</HI> directs this, to obtain a Succe&s;s for their Tillage. Thus the vain <HI>Idolaters,</HI> looking on the god of the <HI>Vine,</HI> as a <HI>Male,</HI> and the god of the <HI>Grain</HI> as a <HI>Female;</HI> they would by the Rice of a <HI>Mixed Seed</HI> unite them, that &s;o they might have a <HI>lucky Vintage.</HI></P>
<P>But, Methinks, I &s;ee a further Intent in this <HI>Law.</HI> There have been <HI>Two Seeds</HI> in the World, ever &s;ince the <HI>Third Chapter</HI> of <HI>Gene&s;is; Two Seeds</HI> very different from one another. Syrs, The&s;e <HI>Two Seeds</HI> will never do well together. Let them them keep at a due Di&s;tance from one another. The <HI>Work of GOD</HI> in your Souls will not thrive, if you do not <HI>&s;ave your &s;elves from the untoward Ge|neration.</HI> As for them who are evidently a <HI>Seed of Evil doers, and Children that are Corrupters,</HI> the Voice from Heaven to you is; <HI>Come out from a|mong
<PB N="94" REF="002905_0099_0FE6929D728EA468">them, and be ye &s;eparate, &s;aith the Lord, and I will receive you; yea, I will be a Father unto you; and ye &s;hall be my Sons and my Daughters, &s;aith the Lord Almighty.</HI></P>
<P>Finally; Methinks, The <HI>Husbandry</HI> of <HI>A&s;hes,</HI> may here agreeably enough have &s;ome Notice taken of it.</P>
<P>When we read; P&s;al. CXLVII. 16. <HI>He &s;catters the Hoar-fro&s;t like A&s;hes,</HI> it &s;eems Allu&s;ive to what was done by the ancient <HI>Husbandmen.</HI> We often find it in Books of <HI>Agriculture,</HI> a Receit for En|riching of <HI>Ground</HI> that has been &s;pent, or worn out. There is a <HI>Salt</HI> in <HI>Plants,</HI> which is their pro|per Aliment or Nutriment; and the more of that <HI>Salt</HI> there is in any thing, the better <HI>Dung</HI> it will yield for the producing of a <HI>fruitful Soil.</HI> Now that <HI>Salt</HI> remains in the <HI>A&s;hes</HI> of the <HI>Plants,</HI> after the <HI>Fire</HI> has done its part upon them. We &s;ee our <HI>Husbandmen,</HI> ever now and then burning little Heaps of Rubbi&s;h here and there on their <HI>New|plough'd Ground. Virgil</HI> &s;peaks of &s;uch a Practice diver&s;e times in his <HI>Georgicks.</HI> In all probability the <HI>Hsbandmen</HI> of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did &s;o too. They &s;catter|ed <HI>A&s;hes</HI> here and there on their <HI>Fields;</HI> or per|haps, they ca&s;t <HI>A&s;hes</HI> on their <HI>Dunghills,</HI> where, be|ing diluted by the <HI>Rains,</HI> the <HI>Salt</HI> very deeply im|pregnated them; and rendred them fitter to be &s;pread afterwards upon the Earth.</P>
<P>But now, What I would be at, is, To employ the <HI>Husbandry of A&s;hes,</HI> for the producing of a <HI>fruitful Soul.</HI> And it is to be managed by &s;eri|ous and frequent <HI>Meditations</HI> on Two <HI>Heaps of A&s;hes</HI> which we are all deeply concerned in. Such <HI>Meditations</HI> are the mo&s;t <HI>Fertilizing</HI> Things that
<PB N="95" REF="002905_0100_0FE64697CEB434B8">can be imagined; It will be a <HI>fruitful Soyl,</HI> that &s;hall be impregnated with them.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. <HI>Meditate,</HI> O Dying Man, on the <HI>A&s;hes,</HI> which thy <HI>Grave</HI> will &s;hortly reduce thee to: <HI>Du&s;t and A&s;hes!</HI> Often take a View of thy <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> as <HI>Inci|nerated</HI> in the <HI>Grave.</HI> And Think, <HI>What will all this World be to me, when I am laid up in the du&s;ty Cham|bers of the Hou&s;e appointed for all the Living!</HI> Think; <HI>What have I to do, that I may with Courage and Com|fort go down unto the Chambers?</HI> The <HI>Fruits</HI> of &s;uch Thoughts will be Wonderful!</P>
<P>Secondiy. <HI>Meditate</HI> very much on the <HI>A&s;hes</HI> which will cover the Face of the Earth, when the <HI>Flames</HI> that are now quickly to be looked for, have done their part upon it. If the <HI>coming of the Son of Man in the Clouds of Heaven,</HI> which cannot mean any other than His <HI>Per&s;onal</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;ible</HI> Coming, mu&s;t be at and for the De&s;truction of the <HI>Roman</HI> (Papal) Monarchy, which mu&s;t be given up to <HI>Burning Flames!</HI> If the <HI>Second coming</HI> of our Lord, which will be in <HI>Flaming Fire,</HI> mu&s;t be at and for the Perdition of the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> who has now run thro' his Period of <HI>Twelve hundred and &s;ixty Years;</HI> If the promi&s;ed Felicities for the Church upon <HI>Earth,</HI> take not place before the <HI>New Earth;</HI> And, if the <HI>New Earth</HI> arrive not before, but mu&s;t be brought in by, the <HI>Conflagration</HI> which will make a dreadful Havock <HI>on the Earth, and the Works</HI> that are in it; Then, we know not how &s;oon the <HI>Earth</HI> mu&s;t undergo the tremendous Revolution, which the XXIV. Chapter of <HI>I&s;aiah</HI>'s Prophecies, and a thou|&s;and other In&s;pired Oracles, have de&s;cribed and foretold unto us.

<P>At a <HI>Vintage</HI> of old, their U&s;age was to have Songs of Mirth and Joy; In the <HI>Vineyards</HI> there would be Singing, with glad Shouts and Accla|mations.

One of the Puni&s;hments threatned unto the <HI>Unfruitful Vineyard,</HI> is in this Article; <HI>I will command the Clouds, that they Rain no Rain upon it.</HI> The Interpretation of the <HI>Parable,</HI> and of this Ar|ticle in it, which I find in the Writings of the <HI>Ancients,</HI> when I <HI>&s;eek Under&s;tanding from them,</HI> is to this purpo&s;e;

I. We will enquire, fir&s;t; <HI>When</HI> may a People have it &s;aid of them, That GOD <HI>commands the Clouds</HI> to di&s;til <HI>no Rain</HI> upon them?</P>
<P>In general; Tis when a People have not the <HI>Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel,</HI> to bring them home unto GOD.</P>
<P>By the Rain here &s;poken of, tis agreed among Expo&s;itors, That <HI>Coele&s;tis Doctrina,</HI> or, Heavenly In&s;tructions are intended. It is well known, That in the Hebrew Language, both the <HI>Raining</HI> of Heaven, and the <HI>Teaching</HI> of Heaven, are expre&s;|&s;ed in Terms that come from the &s;ame Root. Even the Margin of the Bible in our Tran&s;lation, gives us a notable intimation of This; at Joel II. 23. <HI>He hath given you the former Rain.</HI> In your Margin tis, <HI>A Teacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>In the Sacred Scriptures, we find the <HI>Teachers of Truth,</HI> re&s;embled unto the <HI>Clouds</HI> of Heaven. To the&s;e there may be applied that Word, I&s;a. LX. 8. <HI>Who are the&s;e, that fly as a Cloud?</HI> No wonder then, that the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, which is taught by the&s;e, is re&s;embled unto <HI>Rain.</HI> The&s;e are they who may &s;ay, Deut. XXXII. 2. <HI>My Speech &s;hall di&s;til as the &s;mall Rain upon the tender Herb, and as the Showers upon the Gra&s;s.</HI> Now,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t; When the Glorious GOD be&s;tows not Able and Faithful Mini&s;ters of His Go&s;pel on a People, then He <HI>commands the Clouds</HI> to di&s;til <HI>no Rain</HI> upon them. The more U&s;eful <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the Go&s;pel, are &s;ometimes <HI>taken away</HI> from a Peo|ple.

The <HI>Clouds</HI> that &s;hould have <HI>Rain|ed</HI> the <HI>Word of Life</HI> upon a People, are blown out of <HI>the</HI> World, when they have no <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> to be the Di&s;pen&s;ers of the Go&s;pel unto them.

There are <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> who are meer <HI>Good-for-nothings:</HI> Their chief Talent lies at making of <HI>Chri&s;tle&s;s Chri&s;tians.</HI> If they &s;hould over|come Sloth &s;o far as to do &s;omething like <HI>Preach|ing</HI> an hundred times in a Year, there is not one right <HI>Go&s;pel Sermon</HI> among all their Harangues. They are &s;uch Bunglers at <HI>Praying,</HI> that it would &s;hamefully expo&s;e them, to put them upon it.

More than &s;o, Secondly; When a People that &s;it under <HI>Good Mini&s;ters,</HI> do <HI>get no Good</HI> by them; then GOD <HI>commands the Clouds</HI> to di&s;til no <HI>Rain</HI> upon them.

<P><PB N="122" REF="002905_0127_0FE6920667CE8570">
The <HI>Book</HI> of GOD and of <HI>Truth,</HI> has taught us, That the <HI>Clouds</HI> are the <HI>Creatures</HI> of GOD. So we read; Joh. XXVI. 8. <HI>He bindeth up the Waters in His Thick Clouds, and the Cloud is not rent under them.</HI> So we read; Job XXXVII. 15. <HI>GOD cau&s;es the Light of His Cloud to &s;hine.</HI> The <HI>Clouds</HI> are there|fore called, The <HI>Chariots</HI> of GOD, and, The <HI>Chambers</HI> of GOD; and, The <HI>Trea&s;ures</HI> of GOD; and the <HI>Stories</HI> which are <HI>built</HI> by GOD.

<P>And then, This Book of His, has taught us, That the <HI>Rains</HI> too are the <HI>Creatures</HI> of GOD. So we read; Job V. 10. <HI>GOD giveth Rain upon the Earth, and &s;endeth Waters upon the Field.</HI> So we read; Job XXXVI. 27, 28. <HI>GOD maketh &s;mall the drops of Water, they pour down Rain according to the Vapour thereof: Which the Clouds do drop, and di&s;til upon Man abundantly.</HI> We are accordingly informed, That GOD is the <HI>Father of the Rain;</HI> and, That GOD <HI>makes a Decree for the Rain.</HI> When the <HI>Rain</HI> falls, there cometh to pa&s;s that thing; P&s;al.

<P>It is a <HI>Judgment</HI> that is often threatned among the Effects of the Divine Di&s;plea&s;ure: A <HI>Judgment</HI> of great Note among the Threatnings of GOD. Thus you read, Lev.

<P>Indeed, a <HI>Drought</HI> is a Plague, wherein a check is given to the <HI>Ordinary Cour&s;e of Nature.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Hand</HI> of GOD that gives the Check; the Hand of an angry GOD. The <HI>Burning Anger</HI> of GOD is di&s;covered in it.

I. 11. <HI>I called for a Drought upon the Land, and upon that which the Ground bringeth forth, and upon Men, and upon Cattel.</HI></P>
<P>But that in which a <HI>Drought</HI> proves a fearful Plague, is, The <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> of it.

Perhaps <HI>Drink</HI> for Man and Bea&s;t, may grow &s;carce, by a <HI>Drought</HI> going on to Extremity. Be &s;ure, <HI>Food</HI> will do &s;o. Thus we read; Jer. XIV. 3, 4. <HI>Their Nobles have &s;ent their little ones to the Waters, they came to the Pits, they found no Water; they returned with their Ve&s;&s;els empty; they were a&s;hamed and confounded; and cover|ed their Heads: Becau&s;e the Ground is chapt, for there was no Rain in the Earth, the Plowmen were a&s;hamed.</HI> Thus we read; Amos IV. 7, 8. <HI>I have witholden the Rain from you, when there were yet three months to the Harve&s;t; and I cau&s;ed it to rain upon one City, and I cau&s;ed it not to rain upon another City: One piece was rained upon; and the piece whereupon it rained not, withered.&mdash; So two or three Cities wandred unto one City to drink Water; but they were not &s;atisfied.</HI> The <HI>Vegetable World</HI> cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, except the <HI>Showers</HI>

<P>But let us make a &s;ew brief <HI>Inferences,</HI> from what has been thus Remark'd unto us.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. When the <HI>Clouds</HI> do di&s;til <HI>Rains</HI> upon us, our <HI>Thankful Prai&s;es</HI> to the Glorious GOD are called for. My Brethren, Let our <HI>Prai&s;es</HI> go up in a greater Plenty than any <HI>Vapours,</HI> to the <HI>GOD of all Grace,</HI> who now opens and empties the <HI>Bot|tles of Heaven</HI> upon us. We read; Act XIV. 17. <HI>He left not Him&s;elf without a Witne&s;s, in that He did us Good, and gave us Rain from Heaven, and fruitful Sea&s;ons filling our Hearts with Food and Gladne&s;s.</HI> The <HI>Showers</HI> of Heaven then be&s;peak from us
<PB N="126" REF="002905_0131_0FE6920CB0CC4388">the&s;e Thankful Confe&s;&s;ions; <HI>Great GOD; Thou art a good GOD! Oh! How much ought we to love and &s;erve the GOD, who does good unto us, in giving us Rain from Heaven, and fruitful Sea&s;ons!</HI> Verily, The <HI>Showers</HI> are wor&s;e thrown away, than tho&s;e that fall upon the <HI>Rocks,</HI> if they produce not &s;uch Con&s;equences from us.</P>
<P>But, Secondly. When the <HI>Clouds</HI> refu&s;e to di&s;|til <HI>Rains</HI> upon us, the Glorious GOD requires the Di&s;po&s;itions of <HI>Repentance</HI> from us. It is GOD who <HI>commands the Clouds</HI> to di&s;til no <HI>Rains</HI> upon us, when we undergo &s;uch a Calamity. It be|comes us now, with <HI>Repenting Minds,</HI> humbly to enquire, <HI>what Controver&s;y the Holy One may have with us, in &s;uch a Calamity?</HI> And, <HI>what Iniquity it may be, that &s;uch a Puni&s;hment is inflicted for?</HI> 'Tis true; No People under the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> are under &s;uch a <HI>Covenant</HI> for <HI>External Pro&s;perity,</HI> upon Obe|dience to the Laws of GOD, as the <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> Na|tion were, under the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation. The Ble&s;&s;ed GOD has not promi&s;ed unto any People now, That if they will not &s;candalou&s;ly <HI>Break His Covenant,</HI> they &s;hall &s;ee no <HI>Unfruitful Sea&s;ons.</HI> Peo|ple may have the <HI>Showers</HI> of Heaven, and other &s;uch Ble&s;&s;ings denied unto them, and be <HI>brought low thro' Oppre&s;&s;ion Affliction and Sorrow;</HI> And yet be able to &s;ay, <HI>All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt fal&s;ely in thy Covenant.</HI> We &s;ee it, at this very Day. The Peo|ple that have lea&s;t of all paid <HI>re&s;pect unto the Cove|nant</HI> of GOD, yet have not the fewe&s;t <HI>Showers</HI> of Heaven upon them. Neverthele&s;s, when <HI>Showers</HI> are witheld, it is <HI>frequently,</HI> it is <HI>commonly,</HI> a <HI>Pu|ni&s;hment</HI> upon a <HI>Land,</HI> for having <HI>&s;inned grievou&s;ly</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="002905_0132_0FE6920E32BF8808">when <HI>Water-&s;prings are turned into Dry-ground,</HI> and <HI>a Fruitful Land into Barrenne&s;s,</HI> it is u&s;ually, for <HI>the Wickedne&s;s of tho&s;e that dwell therein.</HI> 'Tis, as we read; Deut. XXVIII. 15, 23, 24. <HI>If thou wilt not hearken unto the Voice of the Lord thy GOD, Thy Hea|ven that is over thy head &s;hall be Bra&s;s, and the Earth that is under thee &s;hall be Iron; The Lord &s;hall make the Rain of thy Land Powder and Du&s;t.</HI> Wherefore, under &s;uch <HI>Fiery Rebukes</HI> of our GOD, we &s;hould Loathe and Judge our &s;elves for our <HI>Mi&s;carriages.</HI> Of the&s;e, there is e&s;pecially <HI>One,</HI> that is a very <HI>Comprehen&s;ive One;</HI> That is to &s;ay, Our <HI>Unfruitful|ne&s;s,</HI> our <HI>Unfruitfulne&s;s!</HI> How <HI>Pertinently,</HI> but how <HI>Penitently,</HI> may this <HI>Reflection</HI> be made on this Oc|ca&s;ion! <HI>Lord, We bring forth little good Fruit of the Cultivations which thou do&s;t employ upon us. How fitly, how ju&s;tly, how wi&s;ely, are an Unfruitful People pu|ni&s;hed with Unfruitful Sea&s;ons!</HI> Methinks, I over|hear the <HI>Angel of the Waters</HI> making his Acclama|tions; <HI>Thou art Righteous, O Lord, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t judged &s;o!</HI> It becomes us to <HI>find out</HI> our <HI>Mi&s;carria|ges;</HI> to <HI>Bewail</HI> them, to <HI>Reform</HI> them; and Re|pair unto the great <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of our SAVIOUR for the Pardon of them. Syrs, Our <HI>Main Work</HI> at &s;uch a time, is, To &s;eek <HI>Reconciliation</HI> with GOD. Oh! For Good Terms with the Great KING, from who&s;e Countrey it is, that <HI>our Countrey is nouri&s;hed!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. When we would have the <HI>Clouds</HI> to di&s;til <HI>Rains</HI> upon us, what &s;hall we do, what can we do, but look up to the Glorious GOD for the <HI>&s;upply</HI> of what is wanting unto us? Both the <HI>Former Rain</HI> and the <HI>Latter Rain</HI> is that for which our Glorious GOD is to be look'd unto: The
<PB N="128" REF="002905_0133_0FE6920E572308E0"><HI>Former Rain,</HI> to &s;often the Ground before the <HI>Sow|ing</HI> of the <HI>Seed;</HI> The <HI>Matter Rain,</HI> by which the Corn in the Blade is brought on to <HI>Earing</HI> and <HI>Harve&s;t.</HI> We have a Promi&s;e to plead for it, I&s;a. XXX. 23. <HI>He &s;hall give the Rain of</HI> [or, for] <HI>thy Seed, that thou &s;halt &s;ow the Ground withal, and Bread of the Increa&s;e of the Earth, and it &s;hall be fat and plenteous.</HI> Our GOD can <HI>command the Clouds,</HI> to di&s;til what <HI>Rains</HI> He plea&s;es upon us. Our Main concern is with a GOD, who <HI>commands Delive|rances.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Direction which our GOD has gi|ven us; Zech. X. 1. <HI>Ask ye of the Lord Rain in the time of the latter Rain; &s;o the Lord &s;hall make bright Clouds, and give them Showers of Rain, to every one Gra&s;s in the Field.</HI> And in pur&s;uance of this Di|rection, there is a Notable Thing, which I am to mind you of. In the <HI>Covenant</HI> which our Graci|ous GOD, after the Flood, made with our Patri|arch <HI>Noah,</HI> who was <HI>to Comfort us concerning our Toil, and the Work of our Hands, becau&s;e of the Ground which the Lord had cur&s;ed;</HI> there is a Promi&s;e of <HI>Regular Sea&s;ons,</HI> [Perhaps better than what were before the <HI>Flood;</HI>] wherein <HI>Sea&s;onable Rains</HI> are comprehended. It may be partly with relation to that <HI>Covenant,</HI> that we read; P&s;al. XXXVI. 5. <HI>Thy Mercy, O Lord, is in the Heavens; they Faithful|ne&s;s reacheth to the CLOUDS.</HI> When we want <HI>Rain,</HI> we &s;hould do well in our Supplications to plead that COVENANT of our GOD. It may be, if it were more in U&s;e with us, to plead that CO|VENANT, the <HI>Faithfulne&s;s</HI> of our GOD, would bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the CLOUDS more di&s;play'd before us. My Friends, Our Invitations and our Excitations, to
<PB N="129" REF="002905_0134_0FE69213FA4F0080">our <HI>Supplications,</HI> are Numberle&s;s. Among the&s;e, we have what is very cogent and pungent, when it plea&s;es the Holy One, to &s;end a &s;evere <HI>Drought</HI> upon us. How Wicked, and how Woful, are the <HI>Prayerle&s;s,</HI> at &s;uch a Time, when <HI>our GOD</HI> exhi|bits Him&s;elf as a <HI>Con&s;uming Fire</HI> unto us! <HI>O Prayer|le&s;s ones,</HI> what a Share have you in procuring the De&s;olation, whibh we are in danger of, while you will do nothing for the preventing of it? Our Bu&s;ine&s;s at &s;uch a Time, is, To <HI>look above the Clouds,</HI> unto a Merciful GOD, who <HI>Numbers the Clouds in Wi&s;dom,</HI> and who can <HI>&s;tay the Bottles of Heaven.</HI> Of this GOD, we are told; He is One, who&s;e <HI>Faithfulne&s;s reacheth to the Clouds.</HI> It may be, a GOD of &s;uch <HI>Faithfulne&s;s,</HI> will deal with us, according to the <HI>Word on which he has cau&s;ed us to hope;</HI> Even, that Word; <HI>If I &s;hut up Heaven, that there be no Rain, and my People humble them&s;elves, and pray and &s;eek my Face, and turn from their wicked Ways, Then will I hear from Heaven, and heal their Land.</HI> We mu&s;t come this Day to that Re&s;olution; Jer. XIV. 22. <HI>Are there any among the Vanities of the Gentiles, that can cau&s;e Rain? Or can the Heavens give Showers? Art not thou He, O Lord our GOD? Therefore we will wait upon thee: For thou ha&s;t made all the&s;e things.</HI> It was demanded of old, <HI>Can&s;t thou lift up thy Voice to the Clouds, that abundance of Waters may cover thee?</HI> No; Let us <HI>Lift up our Voice</HI> to the GOD, who <HI>commands</HI> the <HI>Clouds.</HI> 'Tis He alone who can <HI>&s;end abundance of Waters</HI> from thence upon us. He will not &s;o <HI>hide Him&s;elf in a Cloud,</HI> that our <HI>Prayer &s;hall not pa&s;s through</HI> it, and come unto Him.</P>
<P>I have done, The <HI>Sermon</HI> of this Day, comes to you as one of the <HI>Clouds,</HI> from whence the <HI>Rains</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="002905_0135_0FE692141990D490">of Heaven have been di&s;tilling upon you. But, <HI>Clouds di&s;tilling of Rains</HI> often bring <HI>Thunder</HI> with them.

<P>Surely, The <HI>Wicked</HI> that &s;hall be turned <HI>into Hell,</HI> and <HI>all they that forget GOD,</HI> mu&s;t &s;ee very direful Circum&s;tances.

XXXIV. 9, 10. <HI>The Streams thereof &s;hall be turn|ed into Pitch, and the Du&s;t thereof into Brim&s;tone, and the Land thereof &s;hall become burning Pitch; It &s;hall not be quenched Night nor Day, the Smoke thereof &s;hall go up forever.</HI> In that place, GOD from His <HI>Clouds,</HI> being <HI>Terrible from his Holy places,</HI> only &s;ends down <HI>Hail &s;tones and Coals of Fire,</HI> and burning Thunder|bolts.

<P>Oh! Be <HI>per&s;waded,</HI> Immediately to get into the <HI>Peace of GOD;</HI> Immediately to <HI>flee from the Wrath to come;</HI> Immediately to lay hold on the JESUS, who <HI>delivers</HI> from it. Be <HI>per&s;waded, Knowing the Terror of the Lord!</HI></P>

Do your Be&s;t, that you may be the Better for one another.

<P>Secondly. If any of you are Con&s;cious, of your having hitherto omitted any thing that &s;hould have been &s;ome of the <HI>Good Fruit</HI> upon you, <HI>This Day</HI> put your&s;elves into a way that the <HI>Year</HI> may not roll on much further, before you are come unto it. Of This <HI>Good Fruit,</HI> let that Complaint be heard no longer; Jer.

Yea, I urge for This; That we do every one of us <HI>This Day,</HI> &s;tudy &s;omewhat upon that Que&s;tion; <HI>In what points may I become yet more Fruitful unto GOD?</HI> Indeed I can tell no better way to be <HI>&s;pared this Year al&s;o.</HI> It has been an old &s;aying; <HI>Fructus Liberat Arborem.</HI> If the <HI>Tree</HI> would <HI>&s;tand,</HI> let it <HI>bear.</HI> O <HI>Bearing Tree,</HI> If thou fall <HI>This Year,</HI> it &s;hall be only to Tran&s;late thee into the <HI>Eden</HI> that is above.</P>
<P>There are Two or Three Meditations, which I intreat you in the Evening of <HI>This Day,</HI> to give &s;ome Entertainment to. <HI>Mu&s;e, till the Fire burns.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Think This; <HI>Who knows, which are the Trees among us, that are to be cut down this Year?</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="002905_0194_0FE6926C21F9E040">It was of old &s;aid unto one; Jer.

And, <HI>Lord, Is it I?</HI> So may every one &s;ay. No one knows, who&s;e Lot it will be; whether it mayn't be <HI>his own, To die this Year.</HI></P>
<P>Again; Think This; <HI>If I am cut down before I begin to bring forth Fruit unto GOD, what will be|come of me?</HI> Tis a terrible Word; Matth.

<P>Finally; Think This; <HI>Tho' I &s;hould not be cut down, yet if I do not bring forth good Fruit, I may be as bad as cut down.</HI> I will fay unto you, what will be <HI>as Bad! As Bad</HI> as a <HI>cutting down</HI> will be that Sentence from the Mouth of GOD; Matth.

<P>And now Retire; If you pre&s;ently <HI>bring forth Fruit,</HI> Even, <HI>This Day;</HI> for a <HI>To Morrow</HI> mu&s;t not be talk'd of; <HI>Tis well!</HI> But, <HI>if not,</HI>&mdash; Then <HI>Af|ter That!</HI>&mdash;who can &s;ay, what is to follow? Oh! Con&s;ider of it.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Joy of Harve&s;t</HI> is now before us!

Of this, the Holy SPIRIT of GOD has here given us this A&s;&s;urance; <HI>Let us not be weary in well-doing; for in due &s;ea&s;on we &s;hall Reap, if we faint not.</HI> It &s;eems,
<PB N="193" REF="002905_0198_0FE6927444CD3B98">The <HI>Work</HI> of PIETY may not be without its <HI>Weari&s;ome Difficulties:</HI> Things which our <HI>Carnal Minds</HI> may di&s;po&s;e us to be too &s;oon weary of.

There will be an <HI>Harve&s;t,</HI> wherein thou &s;halt <HI>Reap,</HI> what will be a <HI>Great Reward,</HI> yea, a <HI>Full Reward</HI> of all: The Oracles of our GOD have expre&s;ly called it &s;o. But it is a <HI>Sea&s;on</HI> that mu&s;t be waited for.</P>
<P>Our Apo&s;tle is exhorting of the Faithful to &s;hake off, yea, <HI>cut off.</HI> (with a ju&s;t <HI>Excommunica|tion</HI>) the <HI>Fal&s;e Teachers</HI> from whom they &s;uffered more than a little <HI>Trouble.</HI> But at the &s;ame time, he exhorts them to advance a <HI>Liberal Maintainance</HI> for the Orthodox, Diligent, Vigilant <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the Go&s;pel.

III. 10. <HI>Say ye to the Righteous, that it &s;hall be well; For they &s;hall eat the Fruit of their Doings:</HI> I will now <HI>execute</HI> it, <HI>&s;aying</HI> what I am thus led unto. What I have to &s;ay, is in this <HI>Admonition</HI> of GOD our SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>Whatever <HI>Difficulties</HI> the Work of PIETY may be encumbred withal, yet, <HI>Thy Work &s;hall be Rewarded, &s;aith the Lord:</HI> There will be a <HI>Joyful Harve&s;t</HI> of it.</P>
<P>The Work of PIETY is, that <HI>Whole Duty of Man,</HI> which has been &s;umm'd up in that Wedge

<P>Of this <HI>Work,</HI> it is ordered by the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of a Sovereign GOD, that it &s;hall be attended with <HI>Difficulties;</HI> even &s;uch as may render a <HI>Toil&s;ome Husbandry</HI> a Re&s;emblance of it. That which cre|ates the <HI>Difficulties</HI> of this Work, is principally the <HI>Self-denial,</HI> which our <HI>Carnal Mind,</HI> makes nece&s;|&s;ary to be exerci&s;ed, in our doing of it. Our <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> mu&s;t be cro&s;s'd, and our <HI>Appetites</HI> mu&s;t be morti|fied; yea, there are <HI>Enemies</HI> to be Encountred, that are not ea&s;ily to be Conquered; or el&s;e the Work of PIETY can't be carried on.</P>
<P>But, GOD will <HI>not forget this Work and Labour of Love.</HI> O PATIENCE, Do thou per&s;i&s;t, even to <HI>Long-&s;uffering,</HI> in the work of PIETY; There will be a <HI>Joyful Harve&s;t</HI> of it.

<P>It is ob&s;ervable; The People of GOD are put unto Con&s;iderable <HI>Expen&s;es,</HI> that the <HI>Ordinances of Heaven</HI> may be &s;upported in the Churches of the Lord.

<P>An Ob&s;ervation akin to This, may be made; The more <HI>Pains</HI> any Take, and the more <HI>Travel</HI> or <HI>Hard&s;hip,</HI> they pa&s;s through, that they may wait upon GOD in His In&s;titutions; The more does our Gracious GOD often grant unto &s;uch Devout Souls, of <HI>Communion</HI> with Him&s;elf in them. They are well-paid for their <HI>Pains,</HI> in what of GOD they meet withal. There will be an Immediate <HI>Harve&s;t!</HI> The <HI>Rain</HI> with which they have been Weather beaten, is requited in the <HI>Rain</HI> of the Heavenly <HI>Doctrine,</HI> falling &s;weetly on their Souls. The <HI>Cold</HI> which has pinched them, is requited in the <HI>Heavenly Warmth,</HI> with which they find their Souls invigorated. Or, If they leave any <HI>Plea&s;ant Company,</HI> for the &s;ake of &s;ecret Interviews with Heaven, they meet with &s;uch <HI>Plea&s;ures</HI> in the

<P>Moreover; Chri&s;tian, under Afflictions from the Hand of GOD, <HI>Let Patience have its perfect Work.</HI> There will be this <HI>Harve&s;t</HI> of it; The <HI>Con&s;olations of GOD,</HI> which are <HI>not &s;mall,</HI> &s;hall fill <HI>thy</HI> Contented Mind.

<P>Again; Under <HI>Injuries</HI> from the Hand of Man; Take no <HI>Per&s;onal Revenge;</HI> Be <HI>Full of Goodne&s;s;</HI> and even <HI>overcome Evil with Good:</HI> Seek not that which <HI>Fle&s;h and Blood</HI> may call <HI>Satisfaction.</HI> There will be this <HI>Harve&s;t</HI> of it.

<P>Finally; A Furious and Fiery A&s;&s;ault of <HI>Temp|tations,</HI> 'tis no ea&s;y thing to Re&s;i&s;t it. To gratify a <HI>Temptation,</HI> appears the mo&s;t agreeable thing in the World unto a Man, who has the <HI>Blinding
<PB N="198" REF="002905_0203_0FE6476D414E2AE0">Force</HI> of it upon him. There is no little <HI>Difficulty,</HI> in &s;aying, <HI>How &s;hall I do this Wickedne&s;s, and Sin a|gain&s;t GOD?</HI> But now, the <HI>Harve&s;t</HI> will be this. There is a marvellous <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> of Soul, wherewith a <HI>Victory</HI> over <HI>Temptation</HI> u&s;es to be ac|companied.

Thus is there accompli&s;hed, that Word concerning the <HI>Maxims</HI> of PIETY; P&s;al. XIX. 11. <HI>In keeping them there is great Reward.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, Secondly; The Work of PIETY may <HI>Reap</HI> &s;ome <HI>Harve&s;t,</HI> even in the <HI>Temporal Enjoy|ments</HI> of this World. In the Work of PIETY, we are called often to part with &s;uch Things, as ap|pear, and we count <HI>our Intere&s;t:</HI> But the Work is often <HI>Rewarded</HI> in tho&s;e very Things.

<P>Another Catalogue of <HI>Remarkable Things,</HI> is now to be hearken'd to.</P>

<PB N="199" REF="002905_0204_0FE6476EB4AE2908">GOD <HI>kept</HI> all they had.

<P>The SUN was no doubt, one of the Fir&s;t Ob|jects, in the ancient <HI>Idolatry,</HI> wherein the <HI>Evil Heart of Unbelief</HI> in the Children of Men, betimes di&s;po&s;ed them to <HI>Depart from the Living GOD.</HI> And if any Vi&s;ible Creature could &s;tand fair for <HI>Ado|ration,</HI> the SUN would bid as fair as any for it;
<PB N="220" REF="002905_0225_0FE648E5062D2958">and with more <HI>Shadow</HI> of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> be adored, than many Things, which the more Bruitified Pagans Deified. But, GOD forbid! If we <HI>Behold the SUN when it &s;hines, our Mouth &s;hall not ki&s;s our Hand</HI> unto it. We will <HI>Fear GOD, and give Glory to HIM</HI> alone.</P>
<P>How notably does the <HI>Sun,</HI> as an In&s;trument in the Hand of the Glorious GOD, <HI>Illuminate</HI> This, as well as all the other Planets, and their <HI>Satellits,</HI> that move about it, as the wondrou&s;ly contrived Center of them! How notably does the <HI>Sun,</HI> tho' but In&s;trumentally &s;till, <HI>Invigorate,</HI> the whole <HI>Vegetable</HI> as well as <HI>Animal</HI> World; So that if its Influences were ob&s;tructed or &s;u&s;pended, the <HI>Earth</HI> would <HI>mourn and fade away;</HI> the Land would be <HI>utterly emptied</HI> and <HI>utterly &s;poiled!</HI></P>
<P>Look to the Heavens, O HUSBANDMAN; and Glorify the Infinite <HI>Father of Lights,</HI> and ma|ker of the SUN, who keeps the World from <HI>Lan|gui&s;hing,</HI> by the Rays which <HI>He</HI> &s;ends forth from &s;uch a <HI>Creature</HI> upon it. Are not the Eyes, which cannot behold the SUN, much more daz|zled before the Infinite GOD, <HI>with whom there is terrible Maje&s;ty!</HI></P>
<P>But let thy Thoughts proceed unto thy SAVI|OUR, who is, <HI>The Light of the World.</HI> Think, and wi&s;h, at this rate.</P>
<P><Q>O Thou SUN of <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> Do Thou <HI>Ri&s;e</HI> unto me with <HI>Healing in thy Wings.</HI> Thou art as U&s;eful and as Needful unto my Soul, as the <HI>Sun</HI> is unto the World. Thou art unto the <HI>Intellectual World,</HI> what the <HI>Sun</HI> is to the <HI>Material.</HI> In <HI>thy Light,</HI> Oh! Let me <HI>&s;ee Light;</HI> and by <HI>Thy Light,</HI> Let <HI>me walk thro' Darkne&s;s.</HI> Do thou Impart <HI>Life,</HI>
<PB N="221" REF="002905_0226_0FE648FD243B3908">and <HI>Warmth,</HI> and <HI>Growth</HI> unto me. O Thou <HI>Face of GOD, &s;hine thou</HI> upon me, and <HI>I &s;hall be Saved.</HI> Lord, I peri&s;h, if thou <HI>hide thy Face</HI> from me!</Q></P>
<P>Behold, The PIETY of the HUSBAND|MAN; upon his Exerci&s;e whereof we may &s;ay, I&s;a. XXVIII. 26, 29. <HI>His GOD doth in&s;truct him to Di&s;cretion, and doth teach him.&mdash; This al&s;o cometh forth from the Lord of Ho&s;ts, who is wonderful in Coun|&s;el, and excellent in Working.</HI></P>
<P>We read concerning a Great KING, 2 Chron. XXVI. 10. <HI>He was a lover of Husbandry.</HI> Yea, the Subject of <HI>Husbandry</HI> has been adorned, if I am not mi&s;informed, by the Writings and Labours of more than <HI>Twenty Kings.</HI> But here is that more Noble <HI>Husbandry,</HI> which the Glorious KING of Heaven will with Delight look down upon: And an <HI>Husbandry,</HI> which it would be no Diminution for <HI>Kings</HI> to be <HI>&s;erved</HI> from. Such <HI>Husbandry</HI> will &s;omewhat praelibate and emulate the Tillage of that <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> wherein the Saints that &s;hall be <HI>caught up to meet the Lord,</HI> that they may e&s;cape the Flames of the Burning World, &s;hall afterwards come down <HI>changed</HI> and <HI>&s;inle&s;s,</HI> and in a <HI>New Earth wherein &s;hall dwell Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> they &s;hall <HI>plant Fields,</HI> and <HI>eat the Fruit of them;</HI> and the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Ones</HI> who <HI>&s;ee GOD,</HI> &s;hall al&s;o <HI>Inherit the Earth.</HI></P>
