<HEAD>A PREFACE BY THE United Mini&s;ters OF <HI>BOSTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE en&s;uing Sermon was preach'd upon as lamentable an occa&s;ion, (of a private nature) as has been known among us, That any of the &s;ons of <HI>New-England,</HI> who have been born and educated in this land of light, &s;hould be &s;o for&s;aken of GOD, and given up to their lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, as
<PB N="ii" REF="003102_0004_0FEFA646312B3820">to engage in a bloody and fatal DUEL, de&s;erves to be bewailed with tears of blood. Hitherto our chil|dren, by the good hand of GOD upon them, have been re&s;train'd from this <HI>great tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI> But now that an in&s;tance of it among <HI>them,</HI> has been per|mitted in the holy and &s;potle&s;s providence of GOD, it certainly becomes <HI>the Lord's Mini&s;ters,</HI> not only to lament it in their prayers, and to cry (as they of old were directed to do, when a man was found &s;lain in the field, and it was not known who did it, Deut. 21.8.) <HI>Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people's charge!</HI> But al&s;o loudly to te&s;tifie again&s;t it from the word of GOD, that this <HI>Sin, by the Command|ment,</HI> explain'd and inforc'd upon the minds and con&s;ciences of men, may appear to them to be <HI>ex|ceeding &s;inful,</HI> and <HI>others may fear, and do no more &s;o wickedly:</HI> Without this we can't di&s;charge the duty we owe to GOD and to our people; nor &s;hall we be able to &s;ay, if the like &s;hould be again com|mitted, (which GOD prevent!) that we are <HI>pure from the blood of all men,</HI> the blood of their bodies and of their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>FROM con&s;cience of duty in this regard (we believe) the following &s;ermon was preach'd at the publick lecture in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in which the <HI>ca&s;e of Duelling</HI> is &s;olidly and judiciou&s;ly (tho' conci&s;ely and briefly) handled, and the &s;ins which lead to it faithfully warn'd again&s;t.</P>
<P>AND we would all of us <HI>unite</HI> in a <HI>loud cry</HI> again&s;t a &s;in, the cry of which we are &s;ure reacheth up to Heaven.</P>
<P>MURDER is a &s;in of the fir&s;t magnitude; it is in its own nature the mo&s;t execrable fact that can be committed; and hath been always &s;o accoun|ted by tho&s;e who have had even any humanity, not to &s;ay religion: The light of nature condemns it,
<PB N="iii" REF="003102_0005_0FEFA611E24B6F28">and the con&s;ciences of all men &s;tartle at it. How vehemently it is forbidden, and how &s;everely puni&s;h'd by the word &amp; law of GOD, we need not &s;ay to tho&s;e who are acquainted with their BIBLES. In &s;hort, the mo&s;t barbarous people have a quick &s;en&s;e of the heinou&s;ne&s;s of this &s;in, and of the vengeance due to it, <HI>Acts</HI> 28.4.</P>
<P>BUT as there is no &s;in, no the vile&s;t &amp; blacke&s;t, but thro' the &s;ubtilty of the old &s;erpent, may be varni&s;h'd over with gay colours, &s;o as to make a &s;pecious appearance to the &s;imple and unwary; thus it has been with <HI>that</HI> we are now te&s;tifying again&s;t and condemning. And there are tho&s;e to be met with, who will not allow one man's killing another, in what we call a <HI>Duel,</HI> i. e. <HI>a fight with in&s;tru|ments of death, upon a challenge given and accep|ted,</HI> to be a murder in the nature of the fact. But &s;urely the&s;e men <HI>under&s;tand not what they &s;ay, nor whereof they affirm:</HI> They err, not knowing the Scriptures; not di&s;cerning how <HI>exceeding broad</HI> the commandment and law of GOD is; even that law which the Apo&s;tle tells us was not <HI>made for a righteous man, but for the lawle&s;s and di&s;obedient, for the ungodly, and for &s;inners, for unholy and profane,</HI> FOR MAN-SLAYERS, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.9.</P>
<P>How comes this not to be a <HI>Murder?</HI> It is indeed an <HI>aggravated</HI> and <HI>complicated Murder.</HI> "Both kinds of murder are united in it; the mur|der of a man's &s;elf, and the murder of his nei'bour al&s;o". The man's voluntarily expo&s;ing his own life to this hazard, and opening his body (as it were) to the &s;word of him that &s;lays him, does not make it otherwi&s;e. This is plain and evident, becau&s;e no man has this power over his own life to lay it down of him&s;elf, at his own plea&s;ure, and therefore cannot give power to another to take
<PB N="iv" REF="003102_0006_0FEFA64944DC85A8">it away. For GOD is the ab&s;olute LORD of life, and has re&s;erv'd the di&s;po&s;al of it intirely to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THAT this is a heinous breach of the <HI>&s;ixth commandment,</HI> is made evident in the following Ser|mon beyond &s;ober contradiction: And it is our de&s;ign not to <HI>add</HI> to it, but to <HI>concurr</HI> with it. Enough al&s;o is &s;aid in it, to &s;hew how weak and fal&s;e, how vain and ab&s;urd that plea and pretence is, with which &s;ome of the <HI>Hectors</HI> of the world would excu&s;e and ju&s;tifie the horrid practice, namely, <HI>That it is brave and heroic, gallant and honourable in this way to revenge affronts, and decide di&s;putes.</HI> Were men's minds po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a ju&s;t notion of things, they would on the contrary pronounce it ba&s;e and igno|ble, &s;candalous &amp; di&s;honourable, to give or accept a challenge; for they who do &s;o appear to be de&s;titute of tho&s;e vertues and graces which adorn and ennoble the humane &s;oul, and which are always requi&s;ite to make a <HI>great man:</HI> And it is impo&s;|&s;ible for an action to be truly valorous or honoura|ble, which proceeds from &s;uch ba&s;e and vile principles as pride, hatred, covetou&s;ne&s;s, revenge, and the like, the common incentives to Duels. No; let it never be call'd manly courage, but brutal rage, or devili&s;h fury.</P>
<P>THE thing &s;hould not be nam'd among us, but with the utmo&s;t indignation and dete&s;tation, as becometh chri&s;tians And we can't but joyn, <HI>all of us,</HI> in that humble motion to our civil Rulers, that a &s;everer <HI>Edict</HI> may be made again&s;t it, and &s;ome farther brand of infamy put upon it by <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>AND, Oh! that all our <HI>young people</HI> may con|ceive a <HI>horror</HI> at the tho't of this crime! And may be effectually warn'd to &s;hun every thing that leads to, or may be an occa&s;ion of it; to flee tho&s;e

<P>OUR hearts even bleed when we think of the danger the children of our people are in at this day, of being led into <HI>all licentiou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> by the &s;inners which entice and enchant them, till they are <HI>drowned in de&s;truction and perdition.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_TO Fear GOD, and keep His Com|mandments is the whole duty of Man. And this GOD's People are peculiarly oblig'd to, becau&s;e the LORD is their GOD: He hath writ|to them the great things of his Law, and taken them nigh to Him&s;elf in his Covenant, Exod. 20.2, 3. <HI>I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the hou&s;e of bondage. Thou &s;halt have no other gods before me.</HI> Now, in order to this it is very need|ful that we &s;eparate our &s;elves from wicked men, who openly contemn GOD's Authority &amp; Laws. Accordingly the P&s;almi&s;t &s;peaks to &s;uch in the words of my text, <HI>Depart from me, ye evil doers</HI>&mdash; By evil doers we are to under&s;tand the workers of iniquity, who make a bu&s;ine&s;s of Sinning, and &s;eek to draw others into a fellow&s;hip with them in their works of darkne&s;s.

<Q><HI>IF we wou'd keep the Commandments of GOD, we mu&s;t Renounce the communion and familiar Society of evil Doers.</HI></Q>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;pend time to prove this plain Truth; that it is our duty to keep the Commandments of GOD. But &s;hall &s;peak to the&s;e Two Propo&s;itions only under the Doctrine.</P>

<P>I. <HI>We may Con&s;ider &s;ome of tho&s;e Sins which evil doers &s;eek to draw others into, and prevail upon them to Commit.</HI></P>
<P>NOW there are no Sins &s;o vile, but ungodly Men will tempt others to commit. I &s;hall rank them under two Heads agreable to the two great and comprehen&s;ive Commands of GOD's Law mention'd by our Saviour, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22 37-40</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>EVIL doers &s;eek to draw others into tho&s;e Sins which are contrary to the Duties we owe to GOD.</HI></P>
<P>THE Sum of the&s;e is contain'd in tho&s;e words, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy beart,</HI> &mdash; 37. <HI>v.</HI> But the&s;e Sinners are haters of GOD: They &s;ay to GOD, <HI>Depart from us; for we de&s;ire not the knowledge of thy ways,</HI> Job 21.24. And then they endeavour to draw others into open Rebellions again&s;t Him, as if they wou'd in this way &s;trengthen them&s;elves again&s;t the Al|mighty. Thus they tempt them to &s;or&s;ake the GOD of their Fathers, and the pure Wor&s;hip He hath appointed in his word for lying Vanities. It is &s;aid of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Wives, <HI>That they turned away his heart after other gods,</HI> 1 King 11.4. There are fal&s;e Opinions and evil Practices which Sin|ners per&s;wade Men to embrace contrary to GOD's Law. Some Hereticks have compa&s;s'd Sea and Land to make <HI>Pro&s;elytes,</HI> and by cunning Cra&s;ti|ne&s;s have deceiv'd the &s;imple &amp; unwary Agrea|bly we have that caution, Eph. 4.14. <HI>That we hence&s;orth be no more children to&s;&s;ed to and fro, and carryed a out with every wind of doctrine, by the &s;leight of men, and cunning craftine&s;s, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</HI> What pains hath the

Again, They tempt others to &s;et their Mouths a|gain&s;t Heaven, in profane <HI>Cur&s;ing</HI> and <HI>Swearing:</HI> A Horrible Crime! The&s;e abandon'd Wretches do not fear this <HI>Glorious &amp; Fearful Name,</HI> THE LORD OUR GOD; they make a light matter of Bla&s;pheming it, and provoke others to take it in Vain; tho' GOD a&s;&s;ureth us, that he <HI>will not hold &s;uch guiltle&s;s.</HI> Furthermore, Evil doers Entice others many times to <HI>Profane the Day of the LORD,</HI> which GOD requireth us to Remem|ber to keep it holy; to neglect the A&s;&s;embling them&s;elves with GOD's People, to pay Homage to Him our Creator and Redeemer: A great O|mi&s;&s;ion indeed! And then to &s;pend this precious time which &s;hou'd, the whole of it, be &s;acred to the LORD, in Idlene&s;s, vain Di&s;cour&s;es, or more hainous Practices. The like may be &s;aid as to <HI>Family Wor&s;hip.</HI> Heads of Families are oblig'd to <HI>Ble&s;s their Hou&s;hold,</HI> (as <HI>David</HI> did
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. 6 20.</NOTE>) by Praying for GOD's Ble&s;&s;ing with and for them. But when Men follow wicked Company they are pre|vail'd upon to ab&s;ent them&s;elves, and grow re|gardle&s;s of this Duty, altho' GOD threaten to <HI>pour out his fury upon the Families that call not on his Name</HI>

<P>THEY are Sons of <HI>Belial</HI> which &s;hake off the yoke, and they endeavour that others may do &s;o to.

As <HI>Joah</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Ama&s;a,</HI> art thou in health my brother, and took him by the beard to <HI>ki&s;s him;</HI> but <HI>&s;mote him,</HI> and &s;hed out his bowels to the ground, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 20.9, 10. At other times they tempt by their <HI>Countenance and Ge&s;tures.</HI> Prov. 6.13. <HI>He winketh with his eyes, he &s;peaketh with his feel, be teacheth with his fingers.</HI> There's a wanton Eye, impure Glances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Sometimes they u&s;e <HI>fair Promi&s;es.</HI> Prov. 1.11, 13. Come with us, <HI>let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cau&s;e: Let us &s;wallow them up alive as the grave, and whole, as tho&s;e that go down into the pit. We &s;hall &s;ind all precious &s;ub&s;tance.</HI> Thus the Adulterous Woman promis'd the fooli&s;h Young Man plea&s;ure, that they &s;hou'd not be detected in their wicked|ne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c. Prov.</HI> 7.18, 20. Thus they hide the hook with a gilded bate, and cover the &s;nare, that they may catch unwary People, and draw them into mi&s;chief, as <HI>the fi&s;hes of the &s;ea are taken
<PB N="20" REF="003102_0028_0FEFA6604D649AA8">in an evil net, and as the birds are caught in the &s;nare.</HI> At other times <HI>they Threaten them,</HI> to ex|po&s;e them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus if Men &s;eem to depend upon them for their bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they will put them in fear le&s;t they fail them, unle&s;s they com|ply with them in &s;uch or &s;uch evil Practices; they mu&s;t follow them to the Tavern, it may be, or other Places of temptation; they mu&s;t <HI>keep open their Shops,</HI> and work on the Evening before the Sabbath day-light, or the&s;e evil Men will deny them their Cu&s;tom. Yea, &s;uch evil doers have &s;ometimes endeavoured to offer violence to Men's Con&s;ciences by <HI>breathing out threatnings</HI> and &s;laughter again&s;t the followers of JESUS CHRIST. Thus did <HI>Saul</HI> before his Conver&s;ion, <HI>Act.</HI> 9.1. <HI>He compelled</HI> the profe&s;&s;ors of the Name of CHRIST, <HI>to bla&s;pheme</HI> the Son of GOD, <HI>Act.</HI> 26.11. Not as if Men cou'd in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e be laid under a nece&s;&s;ity of Sinning; they ought ra|ther to &s;uffer the mo&s;t grievous torments, yea, death it &s;elf. But then, &s;uch Sinners &s;eek in this way to te&s;tify, and as much as in them lies to force them to act contrary to the light and convictions of their own Con&s;ciences. An impious thing in|deed! Again, &s;ometimes they tempt to Sin <HI>under a colour of zeal for Religion.</HI> As the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> taught, That if Children devoted what they cou'd &s;pare to the Trea&s;ury of the Temple, they were free from their obligation to Recom|pence their poor Parents, and &s;o &s;ought to render the fifth Commandment of no effect, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.5&mdash;7.</P>
<P>At other times they lay a&s;ide the mask, and impudently <HI>Banter Men out of their Religion,</HI> &s;eeking to repre&s;ent this mo&s;t excellent thing as unbecoming Men of fa&s;hion and breeding. Abo|minable impiety!</P>

Do not go on to fight again&s;t GOD your &s;elves, and to tempt Others to break His Commands, le&s;t He tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver; but now humble your &s;elves before Him, lay down the weapons of your Rebellion, and cry for Mercy.</P>
