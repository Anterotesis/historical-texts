<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Vindication, was written in order to give, a clear View of Facts; and to free the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, from &s;ome very injurious a&s;per&s;ions, that have been ca&s;t upon them, by ill-minded people out of doors. Whether the writer has acquitted him&s;elf as becomes a candid and impartial vindi|cator, is &s;ubmitted to the judgment of the publick; which is ever finally given without Favour or affection; and therefore the appeal is made to a truly re&s;pectable and &s;olemn tribunal? At the &s;ame time that a &s;incere love is profe&s;&s;ed for all men, and the duty of honour and reverence to|wards &s;uperiors is freely acknowledged, it mu&s;t be allowed that one of the be&s;t ways of fulfilling the&s;e Duties, is in a mode&s;t and humble endeavour,
<PB N="iv" REF="009225_0003_1030BAD675C08368">
by calm rea&s;on and argument, to convince mankind of their mi&s;takes when they happen to be guilty of any. The more elevated the per&s;on who errs, the &s;tronger &s;ometimes is the obligation to refute him; for the Errors of great men are often of very dangerous con&s;equence to them&s;elves, as well as to the little ones below them. However it is a very di&s;agreable ta&s;k, to engage in any kind of oppo&s;ition to the lea&s;t individual in Society; and much more &s;o when the opinions of Gentlemen of the fir&s;t rank and abilities, and of publick bodies of men are to be called in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The world ever has been and will be pretty equally divided, between tho&s;e two great parties, vulgarly called the <HI>winners,</HI> and the <HI>loo&s;ers;</HI> or to &s;peak more preci&s;ely, between tho&s;e who are di&s;contented that they have no Power, and tho&s;e who never think they can have enough.</P>
<P>Now, it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e both &s;ides, either by temporizing, trimming or retreat|ing; the two former ju&s;tly incur the cen&s;ure of a wicked heart, the latter that of cowardice, and fairly and manfully fighting the battle out, is in the opinion of many wor&s;e tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> either. All fur|ther apology for this performance &s;hall be &s;um'd up in the adage. <HI>Amicus Socrates, amicus Plato, &s;ed magis Amica veritas.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Council, and Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been always de&s;irous to make your At|tendance in this General Court as unexpen&s;ive to your Con&s;tituents and as convenient to your&s;elves as the Nature and Incidents of the public Bu&s;ine&s;s will allow. But, as, whil&s;t the War continues, this Province, however happy in the Operations being re|moved

at a Di&s;tance, mu&s;t expect to bear &s;ome Share of the Trouble and Expence of it: It will &s;ome|times unavoidably happen that I mu&s;t be obliged to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> you together at an un&s;ea&s;onable Time.</P>
<P>I HAVE now to lay before you a Requi&s;ition of His Excellency Sir JEFFERY AMHERST, who, ob&s;erv|ing that the great and important Services on which His Maje&s;ty's Regular Troops are now employed, and the Uncertainty of their Return, render it ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, that Provi&s;ion &s;hould be made in Time for garri&s;oning the &s;everal Po&s;ts on this Con|tinent during the Winter, de&s;ires that you would pro|vide for continuing in Pay the &s;ame Number of Troops that remained during la&s;t Winter; that is, Six Captains, Thirteen Subalterns, and Five Hund|red and Seventy Two Privates, amounting in the whole to Five Hundred and ninety one Men.</P>
<P>I MUST ob&s;erve to you that the Nece&s;&s;ity of this Reque&s;t ari&s;es from the pre&s;ent vigorous Exertion in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> which promi&s;es effectually to humble the Pride of our Enemies, and pave the Way to Peace. As this glorious Expedition cannot but have your entire Approbation, I doubt not but you will readily embrace this Opportunity to give a pub|lic Te&s;timony of it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>French</HI> Inva&s;ion of <HI>Newfoundland</HI> mu&s;t give you great Concern upon Account of the National Lo&s;s which the Interruption of the Fi&s;hery there mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned, although this Province will not, in its own particular, greatly &s;uffer thereby. But I am per&s;uaded that the Reign of the <HI>French</HI> in tho&s;e Parts is by this Time near over; and I flatter my|&s;elf that this Government will have &s;ome Share in the Honour of putting an End to it.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</HI></P>
<P>THE great Alarm which &s;pread it&s;elf over the Country upon the <HI>French</HI> getting Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;trong Po&s;t in <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> obliged me with the

Advice of Council to take &s;ome cautionary Steps which have been attended with Expence. But as the&s;e Mea&s;ures were advi&s;ed with an apparent Expe|diency, and have been conducted in the mo&s;t frugal Manner, I doubt not but what has been done will have your Approbation. I &s;hall inform you of the Occa&s;ion of the&s;e Expences, and order the Accounts thereof to be laid before you.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Council, and Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives.</HI></P>
<P>As I have called you together at this Time with Reluctance, &s;o I &s;hall be de&s;irous to di&s;mi&s;s you, as &s;oon as the public Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall have had due Con|&s;ideration.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Speaker,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"This Province has upon all occa&s;ions been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by its loyalty and readine&s;s to contribute its mo&s;t &s;trenuous efforts for his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. I hope this &s;pirit will ever remain as an indelible Characteri&s;tick of this People. Every thing valuable is now at &s;take. Our mo&s;t Gracious Sovereign, and his royal Predece&s;&s;or, of ble&s;&s;ed memory, have for &s;ome years been engaged in a
<PB N="8" REF="009225_0007_1030BADE50574210">
bloody and expen&s;ive, but mo&s;t ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary War, with the powerful Enemies of their Per&s;ons, Crown and Dignity; and con&s;equently of all <HI>our</HI> invaluable civil and religious Rights and Priviledges. The Al|mighty has declared the ju&s;tice of this War, by giving us the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing &s;eries of Victories and Triumphs recorded in ancient or modern &s;tory. From the&s;e Suc|ce&s;&s;es we had rea&s;on to hope that the War would have ended la&s;t year in a glorious peace. Our King and Father has conde&s;cended to tell us that his Endeavours for that purpo&s;e were fru&s;trated by Gallic Chicanery and Perfidy. The King of Spain has been prevailed upon to break his Neutrality, to for&s;ake his alliance with Great Britain, to turn a deaf Ear to the Intere&s;t and Cries of his own Subjects, and to attach him&s;elf to the Party of France and of Hell. But Heaven &s;till &s;miles upon his Maje&s;ty's Arms. We have within this Hour received undoubted Intelligence of a memorable Vic|tory obtained by Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick; and of the Reduction of the Havannah, the Key of the Spa|ni&s;h Trea&s;ury. Be&s;ides an immen&s;e Value in &s;pecie we have taken and de&s;troyed one quarter of the Spani&s;h navy. This has been done at a bad Sea&s;on of the year and in Spite of as Gallant a defence as ever was made of a &s;trong Hold. <HI>Mr. Speaker,</HI> the Fate of North America, and perhaps ultimately of Great Bri|tain her&s;elf depends upon this War.</P>
<P>Our own immediate Intere&s;t therefore, as well as the general Cau&s;e of our King and Country, requires that we &s;hould contribute the la&s;t peny, and the la&s;t drop of Blood, rather than, that by any backwardne&s;s of ours, his Maje&s;ty's Mea&s;ures &s;hould be embarra&s;&s;ed; and thereby any of the Enterprizes, that may be plan|ned for the Regular Troops mi&s;carry. Some of the&s;e Con&s;iderations, I pre&s;ume, induced the A&s;&s;embly, upon his Maje&s;ty's Requi&s;ition, &s;ignified la&s;t Spring by Lord <HI>Egremont</HI> &s;o cheerfully and unanimou&s;ly to rai&s;e thirty three Hundred Men for the pre&s;ent Campaign; and upon another Requi&s;ition, &s;ignified by Sir <HI>Jeffery Am|her&s;t,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="009225_0008_1030BAE2CE629248">
to give a hand&s;ome bounty for inli&s;ting about nine Hundred more into the regular Service. The Colonies we know, have been often blamed without Cau&s;e; and we have had &s;ome &s;hare of it. Witne&s;s the mi&s;carriage of the pretended Expedition again&s;t Canada in Queen Anne's Time, ju&s;t before the infamous Treaty of <HI>Utrecht.</HI> It is well known by &s;ome now living in this Metropolis&punc; that every Article, that was to be provided here, was in &s;uch readine&s;s, that the Officers, both of the army and navy, expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t Surpri&s;e at it upon their arrival. To &s;ome of them no doubt it was a Di&s;|appointment; for in order to &s;hift the Blame of this &s;hameful affair from them&s;elves they en|deavoured to lay it upon the New-England Colonies. I remember, that by &s;ome, who would be thought faith|ful Hi&s;torians, the mi&s;carriage at Augu&s;tin in the la&s;t War, has been attributed to the neglect of the Caroli|nians. But it is now notorious to all, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the mini&s;try of that Day never intended that any good &s;hould come of that Enterprize; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> indeed of any other by them &s;et on foot, during the whole War. The Conduct of that War, &s;o far as the mini&s;try were concerned, has been judged to be one continued abu&s;e upon the Sovereign and his People. Thank God, we are fallen into better Times. The King, the mini&s;try, and the People are happily united in a vigorous pur&s;uit of the common good. Sure|ly then if <HI>we</HI> &s;hould di&s;cover the lea&s;t remi&s;sne&s;s in his Maje&s;ty's Service, as we &s;hould be truly blame-worthy, we may depend upon having matters repre&s;ented in the &s;tronge&s;t light again&s;t us, by tho&s;e who delight to do us harm.</P>
<P>I am therefore clearly for rai&s;ing the men, if Gen. <HI>Amher&s;t</HI> &s;hould not inform us, by the return of the next mail, that he &s;hall have no occa&s;ion for them. But as his Letter is dated the 4th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> before even Moore Ca&s;tle was taken, and &s;ince the Reduction of the Havannah&punc; a number of the Regulars are returned to New-York it is po&s;&s;ible the General may have altered his
<PB N="10" REF="009225_0009_1030BAE48253DEF8">
Sentiments, as to the nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e Provincials.</P>
<P>Waiting 2 or 3 Days however can't make any odds in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, as our Troops are all inli&s;ted to the la&s;t of October. Upon the whole <HI>Mr. Speaker,</HI> I am for a Committee to take the Governor's Speech and the pre|&s;ent Requi&s;ition into Con&s;ideration, and make report" This being &s;econded, <HI>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Otis, Mr. Tyler,</HI> General <HI>Win&s;low,</HI> and <HI>Mr. Witt,</HI> were appointed a Committee to take &s;aid Speech and Requi&s;ition into Con|&s;ideration, and make report. The Committee waited a few Days for the Return of the Expre&s;s, but hearing nothing further about the men it was taken for granted that the General expected them. The Committee therefore without debate unanimou&s;ly reported to the Hou&s;e in favour of rai&s;ing them at the bounty of Four Pounds each, that is, ten Shillings more than was given in the Spring. This Report was likewi&s;e almo&s;t unani|mou&s;ly accepted, and the men are now inli&s;ting.</P>
<P>Here is another In&s;tance of the readine&s;s of this Pro|vince to do every thing in their Power for his Maje&s;ty's Service. This Spirit notwith&s;tanding many ungenerous Sugge&s;tions to the contrary, has remarkably di&s;covered it&s;elf in mo&s;t if not all the Briti&s;h Colonies during the whole War. This Province has &s;ince the year 1754, levied for his Maje&s;ty's Service as Soldiers and Seamen, near thirty Thou&s;and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n be&s;ides what have been otherwi&s;e employed. One year in particular it was &s;aid that every fifth man was engaged in one Shape or another. We have rai&s;ed Sums for the &s;upport of this War that the la&s;t Generation could hardly have formed any Idea of. We are now deeply in debt, but &s;hould think our &s;elves amply rewarded if <HI>Canada</HI> &s;hould be retained.</P>

<P>Upon repre&s;entation made to his Excellency the Governor from a Number of Per&s;ons Inhabitants of the Towns of <HI>Salem</HI> and <HI>Marblehead,</HI> for &s;ome protection to be afforded to the Fi&s;hery, they having received an account of a French Privateer in the Gut of <HI>Can&s;o.</HI> Advi&s;ed that his Excellency give orders for fitting out the Sloop-Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, in order to proceed on a cruize, to the Gut of <HI>Can&s;o,</HI> and Bay <HI>Vert,</HI> for the pro|tection of the Fi&s;hery, and to continue her &s;aid crui&s;e not exceeding one Month; and as his Excellency pro|po&s;es to put on board twenty-&s;ix Provincials, and ten men out of the Ship King George, provided &s;he arrives &s;ea&s;onably, towards manning of the &s;aid Sloop: Advi&s;ed that her proper Crew be augmented to twenty-four men, officers included, upon the following Wages, viz.

<P>The Protection of the Fi&s;hery is undoubtedly a very important object, and the Province at the beginning of the War built a Ship of twen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y Guns, and

words, under which his Excellency had placed a black mark, were accordingly era&s;ed and expunged, and the Me&s;&s;age returned to the Speaker.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the debate a new and &s;urprizing doctrine was advanced. We have &s;een the times when the majority of a council by their words and actions have &s;eemed to think them&s;elves obliged to comply with every Thing propo&s;ed by the Chair, and to have no rule of conduct but a Governor's will and plea&s;ure. But now for the fir&s;t time, it was a&s;&s;erted that the Go|vernor in all ca&s;es was obliged to act according to the advice of the council, and con&s;equently would be deemed to have no Judgment of his own.</P>
<P>In order to excu&s;e if not altogether ju&s;tify the offen|&s;ive Pa&s;&s;age, and clear it from ambiguity, I beg leave to premi&s;e two or three <HI>data.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The natural liberty of man is to be free from any &s;uperior power on earth, and not to be under the will or legi&s;lative authority of man; but to have only the law of nature for his rule. The li|berty of man in &s;ociety, is to be under no other legi&s;lative power, but that e&s;tabli&s;hed by con&s;ent in the common wealth; nor under the dominion of any will, or re&s;traint of any law, but what that le|gi&s;lature &s;hall enact according to the tru&s;t put in it. Freedom then is not what Sir <HI>Robert Filmer</HI> tells us, O. A. 55. A liberty for every one to do what he li&s;ts, to live as he plea&s;es, and not to be tied by any laws. But freedom of men under government, is to have a &s;tanding rule to live by, common to every one of that &s;ociety, and made by the legi&s;lative power erected in it; a liberty to follow my own will in all things where that rule pre&s;cribes not, and not to be &s;ubject to the unknown, uncon&s;tant, uncertain, arbitrary will of ano|ther man; a freedom of nature is to be under no re&s;traint but the law of nature. This freedom from ab&s;olute arbitrary power, is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to, and clo&s;ely joined with a man's pre&s;ervation, that he cannot part with it but by what forfeits his pre&s;ervation &amp; life toge|ther. For a man not having power over his own life, cannot by com|pact or his own con&s;ent en&s;lave him&s;elf to any one, nor put him&s;elf un|der the ab&s;olute arbitrary power of another, to take away his life when he plea&s;es: no body can give more power than he has him&s;elf. He that cannot take away his own life, cannot give another power over it.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Locke</HI>'s DISCOURSE on GOVERN'T. Part II. CH. IV.</BIBL>
<P>The legi&s;lative, whether placed in one or more, whether it be always in being, or only by intervals, though it be the &s;upreme power in every common-wealth, yet in the utmo&s;t bounds of it, it is limited to the public good of the &s;ociety, it is a power that hath no end but pre&s;ervation; and tho&s;e can never have a right to de&s;troy, en&s;lave or de&s;ignedly to impoveri&s;h the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the bounds to which the tru&s;t that is put in them, by the Society, and the laws of God and nature, have &s;et to the legi&s;la|tive power of every common wealth, in all forms of government.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> They are to govern by e&s;tabli&s;hed promulgated laws, not to be varied in particular ca&s;es; but to have one rule for rich and poor, for the favourite at court, and the countryman at plough.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The&s;e laws ought to be de&s;igned for no other end ulti|mately, but the good of the people.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> They mu&s;t not rai&s;e taxes on the property of the people, without the con&s;ent of the people, given by them&s;elves or deputies.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The legi&s;lature neither mu&s;t not can transfer the power of making laws to any body el&s;e, nor place it any where but where the people have.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Id.</HI> Ch. XI.</BIBL>
<P>Where the legi&s;lative and executive power are in di&s;tinct hands, as they are in all moderated monarchies and well formed govern|ments, there the good of the &s;ociety requires that &s;everal things &s;hould be left to the di&s;cretion of him that has the &s;upreme executive power. This power to act according to di&s;cretion for the public good, without the pre&s;cription of Law, and &s;ometimes even again&s;t it, is that which is called <HI>PREROGATIVE.</HI></P>
<P>This power, while employed for the benefit of the community, and &s;uitably to the tru&s;t and ends of government, is undoubted Pre|rogative, and never is que&s;tioned. For the people are very &s;eldom or never &s;crupulous or nice in the point, they are far from examin|ing Prerogative whil&s;t it is in any tolerable degree employed for the u&s;e it was meant, that is for the good of the people, and not mani|fe&s;tly again&s;t it. But if there comes to be a que&s;tion between the executive power and the people, about a thing claimed as a preroga|tive, the tendency of the exerci&s;e of &s;uch prerogative to the good or hurt of the people, will ea&s;ily decide the que&s;tion. Prerogative is nothing but the power of doing public good without a rule. The old que&s;tion will be a&s;ked in this matter of Prerogative, But who &s;hall be judge when this power is made a right u&s;e of? I an&s;wer, between an executive power in being with &s;uch prerogative, and a legi&s;lative, that depends upon his will, for their convening, there can be no judge on earth, as there can be none between the legi&s;lative and the people. Should either the executive or legi&s;lative, when they have got this power in their hands, de&s;ign or go about to de&s;troy them, the people have no other remedy in this, as in other ca&s;es, when they have no judge upon earth, but to appeal to heaven. Nor let any one think that this lays a perpetual foundation for di&s;order, for this operates not 'till the inconveniency is &s;o great that the ma|jority feel it, and are weary of it, and find a nece&s;&s;ity to have it a|mended. But this the executive power or wi&s;e Princes never need come in the danger of; and it is the thing of all others, they have mo&s;t need to avoid; as of all others the mo&s;t perilous.</P>

<P>He that will not give ju&s;t occa&s;ion to think that all government in the world is the product only of force and violence, and that men live together by no other rules but that of bea&s;ts, where the &s;trong|e&s;t carries it, and &s;o lay a foundation for perpetual di&s;order, mi&s;chief, tumult, &s;edition and rebellion, (things that the followers of that hypothe&s;is, i. e. <HI>Filmer,</HI> and the advocates for pa&s;&s;ive obedience, &s;o loudly cry out again&s;t) mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity find out another ri&s;e of go|vernment, another original of political power, and another way of de&s;igning and knowing the per&s;ons that have it, than what Sir <HI>R. Filmer</HI> hath taught us."</P>
<BIBL><HI>Locke on Govt.</HI> B. II. Ch. II.</BIBL>
<P>This other original Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> has demon&s;trated to be the con&s;ent of a free people. It is po&s;&s;ible there are a few, and I de&s;ire to thank God there is no rea&s;on to think there are many among us, that can't bear the names of LIBERTY and PROPERTY, much le&s;s that the things &s;ignified by tho&s;e terms, &s;hould be enjoyed by the vulgar. The&s;e may be inclined to brand &s;ome of the principles advanced in the vindication of the hou&s;e, with the odious epithets <HI>&s;editious</HI> and <HI>levelling.</HI> Had any thing to ju&s;tify them been quoted from Col. <HI>Algernon, Sidney,</HI> or other Briti&s;h Martyrs, to the liberty of their country, an outcry of rebellion would not be &s;urprizing. The au|thority of Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> has therefore been preferred to all others&punc; for the&s;e further rea&s;ons. 1 He was not only one of the mo&s;t wi&s;e, as well as mo&s;t hone&s;t, but the mo&s;t impartial man that ever lived. 2. He profe&s;&s;edly wrote his di&s;cour&s;es on Government, as he him|&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it, "To e&s;tabli&s;h the throne of the great re&s;torer king <HI>William,</HI> to make good his title in the con&s;ent of the people, which being the only one of all lawful governments, he had more fully and clearly, than any Prince in chri&s;tendom&punc; and to ju&s;tify to the world, the people of England who&s;e love of liberty, their ju&s;t and natural rights, with their re&s;olution to pre&s;erve them, &s;aved the nation when it was on the brink of &s;lavery and ruin." By this title, our Illu&s;trious Sovereign GEORGE the III. (whom GOD long pre|&s;erve) now holds. 3. Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> was as great an ornament, under a crown'd head, as the church of England ever had to boa&s;t off. Had all her &s;ons been of his wi&s;e, moderate, tolerant principles, we &s;hould probably never have heard of tho&s;e civil di&s;&s;entions that have &s;o often brought the nation to the borders of perdition. Upon the &s;core of his being a Churchman however, his &s;entiments are le&s;s liable to the inviduous reflections and in&s;inuations that High-flyers, Jacobites, and other &s;tupid Big<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, are apt too liberally to be&s;tow, not only upon Di&s;&s;enters of all denominations, but upon the mode|rate; and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the mo&s;t valuable part of the Church of England it&s;elf</P></NOTE> 1.

So the whole amount of this dangerous propo&s;ition may at lea&s;t in one view be reduced to this, viz. <HI>It is of little importance what a King's chri&s;tian name is.</HI> It is in|deed of importance that a King, a Governor, and all other good chri&s;tians &s;hould have a chri&s;tian name, but whether Edward, Francis or William, is of none, that I can di&s;cern. It being a rule to put the mo&s;t mild and favourable con&s;truction upon words that they can po&s;&s;i|bly bear, it will follow that this propo&s;ition is a very harmle&s;s one, that cannot by any means tend to pre|judice his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on, Crown, Dignity or Cau&s;e, all which I deem equally &s;acred with his Excellency.</P>
<P>If this propo&s;ition will bear an hundred different con&s;tructions, they mu&s;t all be admitted before any that imports any bad meaning, much more a trea&s;onable one.</P>
<P>It is conceived the hou&s;e intended nothing di&s;re&s;pect|ful of His Maje&s;ty, his Government or Governor, in tho&s;e words. It would be very injurious to in&s;inuate this of a hou&s;e that upon all occa&s;ions has di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf by a truly loyal &s;pirit, and which &s;pirit po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es at lea&s;t nine hundred and ninety-nine in a thou&s;and of their con&s;tituents throughout the province. One good natured con&s;truction at lea&s;t &s;eems to be implied in the a&s;&s;ertion, and that pretty &s;trongly, viz. that in the pre|&s;ent &s;ituation of Great Britain and France, it is of va&s;t importance to be a Briton, rather than a Frenchman; as the French King is an arbitrary de&s;potic Prince; but the King of Great Britain is not &s;o <HI>de jure, de facto,</HI> nor by <HI>inclination;</HI> a greater difference on this &s;ide the <HI>Grave</HI> cannot be found, than that which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and the &s;laves of tyranny.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be objected that there is &s;ome differ|ence even between arbitrary Princes in this re&s;pect at lea&s;t, that &s;ome are more rigorous than others. It is granted, but then let it be remembred, that the life of

man is as a vapour that &s;oon vani&s;heth away, and we know not who may come after him, a wi&s;e man or a fool&punc; tho' the chances before and &s;ince Solomon, have ever been in favour of the latter. Therefore it is &s;aid of little con&s;equence. Had it been <HI>No</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>little,</HI> the clau&s;e upon the mo&s;t rigid &s;tricture might have been found barely exceptionable.</P>
<P>Some fine Gentlemen have charged the expre&s;&s;ion as indelicate. This is a capital impeachment in poli|ticks, and therefore demands our mo&s;t &s;erious attention. The idea of delicacy in the creed of &s;ome politicians, implies that an inferior &s;hould at the peril of all that is near and dear to him (i. e. his intere&s;t) avoid every the lea&s;t trifle that can offend his &s;uperior. Does my &s;uperior want my e&s;tate? I mu&s;t give it him, and that with a good grace, which is appearing, and if po&s;&s;ible being really obliged to him that he will conde&s;end to take it. The rea&s;on is evident; it might give him &s;ome little pain or unea&s;ine&s;s to &s;ee me whimpering, much more openly complaining at the lo&s;s of a little glittering dirt. I mu&s;t according to this &s;y&s;tem not only endea|vour to acquire my &s;elf, but impre&s;s upon all around me a reverence and <HI>pa&s;&s;ive obedience</HI> to the &s;entiments of my &s;uperior, little &s;hort of adoration. Is the &s;uperior in contemplation a king, I mu&s;t con&s;ider him as God's vicegerent, cloathed with unlimited power, his will the &s;upreme law, and not accountable for his actions, let them be what they may, to any tribunal upon earth. Is the &s;uperior a plantation governor? he mu&s;t be view|ed not only as the mo&s;t excellent repre&s;entation of ma|je&s;ty, but as a viceroy in his department, and <HI>qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad</HI> provincial admini&s;tration, to all intents and purpo&s;es ve&s;ted with all the prerogatives that were ever exerci&s;ed by the mo&s;t ab&s;olute prince in Great Britain.</P>
<P>The votaries of this &s;ect are all Monopolizers of offi|ces, Peculators, Informers, and generally the Seekers of all kinds. It is better, &s;ay they, "to give up any thing, and every thing quietly, than contend with a &s;u|perior,

For you mu&s;t know, that according to &s;ome of the mo&s;t refined and fa&s;hionable &s;y&s;tems of mo|dern politics, the ideas of right and wrong, and all the moral virtues, are to be con&s;idered only as the vagaries of a weak or di&s;tempered imagination in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and of no u&s;e in the world, but for the &s;kilful politician to convert to his own purpo&s;es of power and profit.</P>

<P>It is well known that the lea&s;t "patriotic &s;park" un|awares "catched," and di&s;covered, di&s;qualifies a can|didate from all further preferment in this famous and flouri&s;hing order of knights errant. It mu&s;t howe|ver be confe&s;&s;ed they are &s;o catholic as to admit all &s;orts from the knights of the po&s;t to a garter and Star; pro|vided they are thoroughly dive&s;ted of the fear of God, and the love of mankind; and have concentrated all their views in <HI>dear &s;elf,</HI> with them the only <Q>&s;a|cred and well-beloved name, or thing in the uni|ver&s;e.</Q> See Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI>'s <HI>Political Te&s;tament,</HI> and the greater Bible of the Sect, <HI>Mandeville</HI>'s <HI>Fable of the Bees. Richlieu</HI> expre&s;ly in &s;olemn earne&s;t, with|out any &s;arca&s;m or irony, advi&s;es the di&s;carding all ho|ne&s;t men from the pre&s;ence of a prince, and from even the purlieus of a court. According to Mandeville, <HI>"The</HI> moral virtues are the political offspring which flattery begot upon pride." The mo&s;t darling princi|ple of the great Apo&s;tle of the order, who has done more than any mortal towards diffu&s;ing corruption, not only thro' the three kingdoms, but thro' the remote&s;t dominions, is, "that every man has his price, and that if you bid high enough, you are &s;ure of him".</P>

difference between the &s;entiments of a Briti&s;h hou&s;e of commons remon&s;trating, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e of a courtier cringing for a favour. A hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives here at lea&s;t, bears an equal proportion to a Governor, with that of a hou&s;e of Commons to the King. There is indeed one difference in favour of a hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives; when a hou&s;e of Commons addre&s;s the King. they &s;peak to their Sovereign&punc; who is truly the mo&s;t augu&s;t Per&s;onage upon earth: When a hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives remon&s;trate to a Governor, they &s;peak to a fellow &s;ubject; tho' a &s;uperior, who is undoubtedly intitled to decency and re&s;pect; but I hardly think to quite &s;o much Reve|rence as his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that a form of &s;peech may be, in no &s;ort improper, when u&s;ed <HI>arguendo,</HI> or for illu&s;tration, &s;peaking of the King, which &s;ame form might be very har&s;h, indecent and even ridiculous, if &s;poken to the King.</P>
<P>The expre&s;&s;ion under cen&s;ure has had the approba|tion of divers Gentlemen of &s;en&s;e, who are quite un|prejudiced by any party. They have taken it to imply a compliment rather than any indecent reflection, upon his Maje&s;ty's wi&s;e and gracious admini&s;tration. It &s;eems &s;trange therefore that the hou&s;e &s;hould be &s;o &s;uddenly charged by his Excellency with <HI>Impropriety, groundle&s;s In&s;inuations,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>What cau&s;e of &s;o bitter Repentance, <HI>again</HI> and <HI>again,</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly have taken place, if this clau&s;e had been printed in the Journal, I can't imagine. If the ca&s;e be fairly repre&s;ented, I gue&s;s the province can be in no danger from a hou&s;e of Repre&s;enta|tives daring to &s;peak plain Engli&s;h, when they are com|plaining of a grievance. I &s;incerely believe the hou&s;e had no di&s;po&s;ition to enter into any conte&s;t with the Governor or Council. Sure I am that the promoters of this addre&s;s had no &s;uch view. On the contrary, there is the highe&s;t rea&s;on to pre&s;ume that the hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives will at all times rejoice in the pro&s;|perity of the Governor and Council, and contribute

But the hou&s;e is and ought to be jealous and tenacious of its own priviledges; the&s;e are a &s;acred depo&s;it intru&s;ted by the people, and the jealou&s;y of them is a godly jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>But to proceed with our narration; on Saturday about a quarter before one of the Clock, Mr. Secre|tary came down with his Excellency's vindication, which is as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have received an An&s;wer from you to a Me&s;&s;age of mine; informing you of my having upon a &s;udden Apprehen&s;ion of Danger, fitted out the Province Sloop to protect a con&s;iderable and very intere&s;ting Fi&s;hery, belonging to this Province: Upon which Occa&s;ion you are plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that the Method of doing this, which you call <HI>making or increa&s;ing E&s;tabli&s;hments is taking from the Hou&s;e the Right of originating Taxes, annihilating one Branch of the Legi&s;lature,</HI> and tending to make <HI>the Government arbitrary.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are hard Words: and the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own Integrity will not permit me to &s;ubmit in Silence to &s;uch Imputations. I know what the Priviledges of the People are, and their Nature and Bounds: and I can truly &s;ay that it has never been in my Thoughts to make the lea&s;t Inva&s;ion of them. If therefore you think pro|per to &s;end &s;uch a Charge as this to the Pre&s;s; I mu&s;t de&s;ire that my Vindication may accompany it.</P>
<P>In Order to which I &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider what the legal and con&s;titutional Powers of the Governor and Council are, then &s;tate the Fact in Que&s;tion, and by Application of the one to the other, &s;ee whether the Conclu&s;ions be|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">mentioned will follow. In this Di&s;qui&s;ition I &s;hall not inqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e <HI>whether any Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">y can be &s;ufficient to ju&s;|tify a Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives in giving up the Privi|ledge of originating Taxes;</HI> as I do not believe that &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was ever de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed by any Per&s;on concerned in the Government, or that any Governor and Council
<PB N="27" REF="009225_0026_1030BB0E1F695608">
&s;ince the Revolution attempted or ever will attempt to tax the People.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s of originating the Taxes mo&s;t certainly belongs to the Repre&s;entatives of the People, and the Bu&s;ine&s;s of i&s;&s;uing Money out of the Trea&s;ury<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, as cer|tainly belongs to the Governor with the Advice of the Council. In general all Votes and Orders for the Charge of the Government originate in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, and the Money for defreying &s;uch Charges is i&s;&s;ued by Warrant of the Governor with the Advice of Council, without any further Reference to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>But as it is impo&s;&s;ible that the General Court &s;hould provide for every Contingency that may happen unle&s;s they were continually &s;itting; there will &s;ometimes be Ca&s;es in which the Governor, with the Council, is to be ju&s;tified in i&s;&s;uing Money for Services not expre&s;ly pro|vided for by the General Court: Of the&s;e there are two very obvious.</P>
<P>The one is, where a Danger ari&s;es &s;o immediate and imminent that there is no Time for calling together the A&s;&s;embly. In this, I apprehend there is no other Li|mitation of Expence, but in Proportion to the Evil impending: For the Safety of the People being the &s;upreme Law, &s;hould at all Events be provided for.</P>
<P>The other is, where the Expence of &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Service is &s;o incon&s;iderable, as to be not worth the while to put the Province to the Charge of the A&s;&s;embly's meeting for that Purpo&s;e only, at an Expence perhaps ten or twenty Times more than the Sum in Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>This I take to be the Law and U&s;age of every Royal Government on the Continent. In that over which I formerly pre&s;ided, where the People were very aver&s;e to frequent or long Se&s;&s;ions of the A&s;&s;embly, I have upon an Emergency, with Advice of the Council only, rai&s;ed Three Hundred Men at a Time, and marched them to the Defence of the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">; and when the A&s;&s;embly has met, have received their Thanks for &s;o doing.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="009225_0027_1030BB0FBA141290">Now let me &s;tate the Ca&s;e in Que&s;tion. Mo&s;t of the principal Merchants in <HI>Salem</HI> and <HI>Marblehead,</HI> who were con&s;iderably intere&s;ted in a Fi&s;hery near the Gut of <HI>Can&s;o,</HI> in which I am told upwards of One Hundred Ve&s;&s;els from this Province were employed, received Ad|vice that there was a French Privateer or Pirate crui&s;ing in tho&s;e Parts. It has appeared &s;ince, that this Alarm was not peculiar to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Province: It reached <HI>Quebec,</HI> from whence an armed Schooner was fitted out to look after this Frenchman. It re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ched <HI>New-York,</HI> from whence General AMHERST a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;ed me of this French Ve&s;&s;el. The&s;e Merchants therefore applying by their Deputies to me for an immediate Protection of their Fi&s;hery, I laid the Matter before the Council, and it hap|pening that the Province Sloop was ju&s;t returned from <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> it was advi&s;ed by the Council, that &s;he &s;hould be immediately fitted out to go to the Protection of this Fi&s;hery: this was done in the mo&s;t frugal Manner po&s;|&s;ible; out of Fifty Men put on board the Sloop, only twenty-four were charged to the Province, the re&s;t were drawn out of the Provincials employed at <HI>Ca&s;tle-William,</HI> and in the recruiting Service; the Ammunition and Military Stores were taken from the Ca&s;tle, to which they have been re&s;tored without Lo&s;s or Expence; the Men were engaged only for one Month, after which they were not to be continued without the Advice of the General Court. This is the true State of this Tran&s;|action; and &s;urely I may &s;ay it de&s;erved a very diffe|rent Animadver&s;ion than what it has had.</P>
<P>Now to apply it to the Cen&s;ure it has met with: This was an Act which the Governor with the Council had a Right to do; it was a legal and con&s;titutional Exerci&s;e of the Powers ve&s;ted in them; it was an Exertion of the Executive Power of the Government, di&s;tinct from that of the Legi&s;lature. If it was wrong and ill advi&s;ed (which I don't mean to admit) it could amount to no more than an improper Application of the public Money, by tho&s;e who have lawful Authority to apply &s;uch Money to the public Purpo&s;es. When this Di&s;tinction
<PB N="29" REF="009225_0028_1030BB1157EB13D0">
is con&s;idered; how can this Act, whether right or wrong, be applied to the Right of originating Taxes, annihilat|ing one Branch of the Legi&s;lature and making the Go|vernment arbitrary?</P>
<P>As for the di&s;cretionary Part of the Act, after I have had the Advice of the Council, and the Approbation of my own Judgment and Con&s;cience&punc; I &s;hall not enter into any f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rther Argument about it, than ju&s;t to ob|&s;erve; That if the Governor and Council legally acting in the Executive Admini&s;tration, and determining to the be&s;t of their Judgment and Skill, with a con&s;cientious Regard to the Good fo the People, &s;hall be liable to be called to account for Difference of Opinion only, the Government will be very much weakned. But I &s;hall per&s;uade my&s;elf that a &s;teady Attention to the Peace and Welfare of the Province, which you recommend to Me, will always &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify my Conduct: and in that Confidence I hope I &s;hall never fail to exert the Powers which have been committed to Me for the Defence and Protection of the People of this Province, by all lawful and con&s;titutional Means.</P>

<P>This being read, the Secretary in&s;tantly informed the Speaker, that his Excellency directed the attendance of the hou&s;e in the council chamber.</P>
<P>The two hou&s;es had fini&s;hed the publick bu&s;ine&s;s; and before this the hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives had by a committee a&s;ked a rece&s;s, &s;o it was pre&s;umed the hou&s;e was &s;ent for to be prorogued, as it turned out. The Speaker ro&s;e to, go up to the council, without de|&s;iring the hou&s;e to attend him, the u&s;ual and regular form, which it is pre&s;umed was forgot. But it was moved that his Excellency's vindication, according to his de&s;ire, &s;hould be printed in the Journal. This motion was &s;econded, and pa&s;&s;ed in the affirmative by a great majority. Then a motion was made and &s;e|conded, for a committee to prepare a Reply to this
<PB N="30" REF="009225_0029_1030BB15C2A8F050">
vindication in the rece&s;s of the court, and to make report at the next &s;e&s;&s;ion; this al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed in the affir|mative by a con&s;iderable majority, and Mr. <HI>Speaker,</HI> Mr. <HI>Otis,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Tyler,</HI> were cho&s;en a committee for &s;aid purpo&s;e. Then the Hou&s;e immediately attended his Excellency in the Council-Chamber. When his Ex|cellency, after giving his a&s;&s;ent to two or three bills, prorogued the court.</P>
<P>It was wi&s;hed, at lea&s;t by the moderate part of the hou&s;e, that his Excellency had thought fit &s;o far to give up the point, as to wave any conte&s;t about it, by a&s;&s;uring the hou&s;e, that if his right was ever &s;o clear, he would not exerci&s;e it, if grievous to the people. A like conde&s;cen&s;ion crowned heads have practi&s;ed, and found their account in it; as I am per&s;uaded his Ex|cellency would, if the unanimous vote of thanks from the whole repre&s;entative body of this people is worth any thing. This I gue&s;s he would have had: And as it is a maxim that the King can do no wrong, but that whatever is ami&s;s is owing intirely to tho&s;e about him; &s;o, with regard to his Excellency, we ought to pre|&s;ume the be&s;t; and that it is to be charged to the account of &s;ome weak or wicked advi&s;ers, that this bu&s;ine&s;s did not end happily. However, the matter is now become very &s;erious, by his Excellency's vindi|cation; which we &s;hall next con&s;ider.</P>
<P>The Charter of the province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, has inve&s;ted the Governor and Council with power to i&s;&s;ue (without the concurrence of the Hou&s;e, as it is now con&s;trued, or rather as the genuine &s;en&s;e of the Char|ter has been waved by former Hou&s;es) the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onies out of the trea&s;ury. But the Que&s;tion is&punc; Whether this power be limited? If it is unlimited, the priviledge of levying taxes by originating them in the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives, is of very little value. What Repre&s;en|tative would plume him&s;elf upon the priviledge of origi|nating taxes, if the money could be &s;quandered away at plea&s;ure; which in other words may happen hereaf|ter to be ju&s;t as the tools and &s;ycophants of power &s;hall

Here &s;eems to be an expre&s;s limitation of the power. Nothing is left to u&s;age or cu&s;tom, much le&s;s to di&s;cretion.

<P>It is clear from hence, that without the aid of an <HI>Act</HI> of the province, the Governor and Council cannot le|gally take a &s;hilling out of the trea&s;ury, let the emer|gency be what it may. It is agreed with his Excellency, that in i&s;&s;uing Money from the trea&s;ury, as the charter
<PB N="32" REF="009225_0031_1030BB1F23B8FD30">

They are con|trollers-general of the Trea&s;ury, i. e. the trea&s;urer can|not pay without their warrant; but then they are as much bound by the acts of the province, as the trea&s;urer him&s;elf. He, the Trea&s;urer, indeed may be called to an account, but they can't, being in other re&s;pects two branches of the Legi&s;lature. The only remedy there|fore is a remon&s;trance, and when that proves ineffec|tual, the hou&s;e may and ought to refu&s;e to &s;upply the Trea&s;ury, and &s;top a few Grants and Salaries; which would &s;oon bring matters right without any dangerous &s;hock to Government, or weakening thereof; but what the whole world mu&s;t impute to a Governor and Coun|cil, that would oblige a Hou&s;e to have recour&s;e to the la&s;t re&s;ort, but one; I mean as we are a dependent Government, a dutiful and humble remon&s;trance to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The Parliament of Great-Britain have as the la&s;t re&s;ort, been known to appeal to Heaven, and the longe&s;t &s;word; but God &s;orbid that there ever &s;hould be occa&s;ion for any thing of that kind again; indeed there is not the lea&s;t danger of it &s;ince the glorious revolution, and the happy e&s;tabli&s;hment re&s;ulting there|from. It was formerly the cu&s;tom for the Speaker of the hou&s;e to &s;ign all warrants upon the trea&s;ury, but this was at la&s;t either tamely given up, or at lea&s;t waved.</P>
<P>It may be objected, that tho' our &s;upply bills appro|priate by far the greate&s;t part of the &s;ums rai&s;ed, yet &s;omething is always expre&s;ly left for contingencies, and the Governor and Council may and mu&s;t in the nature of the thing apply this at di&s;cretion. I an&s;wer, 1. Even this is i&s;&s;ued by force of an act, and not by virtue of any general power in the Governor and Council, inde|pendent of the act. 2. Neither cu&s;tom nor u&s;age &s;up|po&s;e that this &s;um appropriated for contingencies could be applied to the fitting out of men of war, and mak|ing e&s;tabli&s;hments for them; for armed ve&s;&s;els is one expre&s;s appropriation in our acts, which &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ws that

<P N="3">3. All our Governors and Councils have not always confined them&s;elves to the appropriation for contingen|cies but &s;ome have drawn for what they deem'd contin|gencies when they have known the appropriation to be expended, and in &s;hort have not confined them&s;elves to any appropriation in payment; whatever they may have done in the form of their warrants. 4. If the Governor and Council can fit out one man of war, in|li&s;t men, grant a bounty and make e&s;tabli&s;hments, why not for a navy, if to them it &s;hall &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary, and they can make them&s;elves the &s;ole judges of this ne|ce&s;&s;ity. The rumour in the ca&s;e of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts was that fourteen privateers in&s;tead of one <HI>pyrate</HI> were cruizing off Can&s;o. What could this one poor &s;loop have done again&s;t &s;uch odds? <HI>Salus populi e&s;t &s;upre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a Lex.</HI> Why then did not the Governor and Council fit out fourteen men of war, or at lea&s;t enough to take four|teen privateers? It has been &s;aid that there were no privateers among the fi&s;hermen, but that when they di&s;covered the &s;loop, &s;he was taken for one, and that many of the fi&s;hermen ran home in a fright, and lo&s;t their fares. How true this is I can't &s;ay, but have heard it reported, and believe there is at lea&s;t as much ground for it as there was to believe the &s;tory of fourteen pri|vateers. The Governor and Council doubtle&s;s meant well as to the protection of the fi&s;hery, and had there been no unju&s;tifiable exten&s;ion of their power, every one would have thankfully acquie&s;ced. The money for fitting out this &s;loop might have been rai&s;ed by the Governor and Council's promi&s;e to recommend a reimbur&s;ement to the a&s;&s;embly. They might per|haps have borrowed it of the Trea&s;urer upon the &s;ame terms, and the priviledges of the Hou&s;e thereby would have been pre&s;erve. It would be a very ea&s;y thing

to rai&s;e twenty times the &s;um wanted to fit out this &s;loop upon the credit of a like recommendation.

<P>The provi&s;ion made the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion for manning the King George was &s;oon found in&s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e, and-after bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing up for a month the crew amounted to but thirty men. In this condition the &s;hip remained, when I received advice that there were two French privateers on the coa&s;t, and that there were &s;everal more to be expected: I immediately called a Council; at which attended a committee of the mer|chants. The council were of opinion, that the &s;hip &s;hould be immediately fitted out: and in order to do it with more expedition, I offered that if the crew could be quickly compleated to an hundred men, I would put fifty provincials on board for a &s;hort cruize. It was therefore "advi&s;ed to rai&s;e &s;eventy men, and to give ten Dollars bounty: But there was no fund in the Trea&s;ury to <HI>re&s;ort</HI> to for this purpo&s;e. It was therefore concluded to order the Trea&s;urer to borrow &s;even hundred Dollars of the merchants on the credit of the province, <HI>(not on the credit of a recommendation, as it &s;hould have been and perhaps was meant)</HI> which was accordingly done; and I mu&s;t de&s;ire you would take care for the repayment thereof."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The Hou&s;e, after long debate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and divers referrences, on the &s;econd of June, voted, "that the province trea&s;urer be directed to repay the &s;even hundred Dollars borrowed of the merchants <HI>on the credit of the province,</HI> for bounty, in order to man the &s;hip King George."</P>
<P>I want to know why the &s;ame method of rai&s;ing the money might not have been taken the fir&s;t time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ting out the &s;hip King George, and in fit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;achu&s;etts</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="009225_0034_1030BB25976B3958">However, even this method of &s;upplying the trea|&s;ury by the Governor and Council's ordering &s;ub&s;crip|tions upon the credit of the province (by which it is pre&s;umed a recommendation to the a&s;&s;embly is meant) is by no means a ju&s;tifiable practice.</P>
<P>The Governor and Council have naturally a great influence in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Hou&s;es of Repre&s;entatives, and when the money i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> once taken up and applied, it would &s;eem hard to make the &s;ub&s;cribers lo&s;e it; and &s;o in time it would come to be a thing of cour&s;e, for the Hou&s;e to reimbur&s;e all expences the Governor and Council &s;hould be plea&s;ed to create in the rece&s;s of the a&s;&s;embly; and after a cour&s;e of tame acquie&s;cence in &s;uch a prac|tice, the Hou&s;e would become as &s;ome de&s;ire to have it, a very in&s;ignificant&punc; unimportant part of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It is therefore the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, to be very cautious how they allow or approve of any expences incurred even in this way.</P>
<P>His Excellency is plea&s;ed to wave any inquiry "whether any nece&s;&s;ity can be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify a Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives in giving up the privilege of originating taxes?" for this rea&s;on only expre&s;&s;ed; viz. "I don't believe (&s;ays his Excellency) that &s;uch a ce&s;&s;ion was ever de&s;ired by any Per&s;on concerned in the government, or that any Governor and Council &s;ince the revolution, attempted or ever will attempt to tax the people" I wi&s;h I could exerci&s;e as much cha|rity towards former Governors and Councils, as for his Excellency and the pre&s;ent honourable Coun|cil; but I can't. I am verily per&s;uaded, that we have had &s;ome Governors and &s;ome Councellors, &s;ince the revolution&punc; that would gladly have been as ab&s;olute as Turki&s;h Ba&s;haws; and that the whole tenor of their actions has given convincing proof of &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>A tax upon the people in form&punc; by i&s;&s;uing a tax bill, and ordering an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, I believe has not been at|tempted by a Governor and Council &s;ince the revoluti|on. This would be too alarming. The vulgar are apt to be forcibly affected with names and appearances, ra|ther
<PB N="36" REF="009225_0035_1030BB2A1441CE68">
than by realities. If the money can be drawn out of the trea&s;ury without any regard to the appropriations, made by the acts of the province; and the Hou&s;e when|ever called upon, will without murmuring &s;upply the trea&s;ury again; they &s;erve the purpo&s;e of a very con|venient machine to quiet the people; and the money flows in with greater ea&s;e and plenty than if the Gover|nor and Council were, <HI>ad libitum,</HI> to collect and di&s;&s;ipate the public trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that in France and other de&s;potic governments, 'tis often with great difficulty, and &s;ome|times with hazard, that the revenue is collected. Had <HI>Richlieu</HI> and <HI>Mazarine</HI> convinced the parliaments that it was a great priviledge to be allowed to vote as much money as was called for, and for any purpo&s;e the court might want it, the government would have had the ap|pearance of liberty under a tyranny; which to tho&s;e mini&s;ters would have been a va&s;t ea&s;e and &s;ecurity. But tho&s;e great politicians either never thought of this re|finement, or, the parliaments were too &s;tupid to be con|vinced, of the utility of &s;uch a plan.</P>
<P>His Excellency proceeds, "The bu&s;ine&s;s of origi|nating the taxes mo&s;t certainly belongs to the Repre&s;en|tatives of the people; and the bu&s;ine&s;s of i&s;&s;uing money out of the trea&s;ury, as certainly belongs to the Gover|nor and Council." To &s;ay nothing of the doubt that might ju&s;tly be made, whether a non-claim, waver, or even an expre&s;s conce&s;&s;ion by any former hou&s;e, of the privilege of joining in a warrant, for i&s;&s;uing the money, can be binding upon their Succe&s;&s;ors? Would not a &s;tranger to our con&s;titution be lead to think, from this general a&s;&s;ertion of the Governor, that he with the Council, could i&s;&s;ue money without regard to the acts of the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ce, and the <HI>appropriations</HI> thereby made; and that the hou&s;e indeed, had no <HI>right</HI> to appropriate, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the burthen of taxes on the people? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> his Excellency in the next period &s;ays, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> all votes and orders (and acts might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">) for the charge of the government,

For the &s;afety of the people being the &s;upreme law, &s;hould at all events be provided for. The other is, where the ex|pence of &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervice is &s;o incon&s;iderable, as to be not worth the while to put the province to the charge of the A&s;&s;embly's meeting for that purpo&s;e only, at an expence perhaps of ten or twenty times more than the &s;um in que&s;tion." Frequent and long &s;e&s;&s;ions I know are burthen&s;ome to the people&punc; and many think they had better give up every thing, than not have &s;hort &s;e&s;&s;ions. But let the&s;e con&s;ider that it is a very poor bargain, that for the &s;ake of avoiding a &s;e&s;&s;ion ex|traordinary, &s;acrifices the right of being taxed by their Repre&s;entatives; and ri&s;ques ten or twenty times the &s;um in the end, to be levied by a Governor and Council. I know too, that &s;ome gentlemen in order to le&s;&s;en the weight of a Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives&punc; are con&s;tantly exclaiming again&s;t long and frequent &s;e&s;&s;ions; the peo|ple are gulled with the bait, and the hou&s;e when they meet, are often in want of time to compleat the public bu&s;ine&s;s, in the manner that they would wi&s;h, and the na|ture of &s;ome affairs requires. What is the con&s;equence? Why, it is become a very fa&s;hionable doctrine with &s;ome, that in the rece&s;s of the court, the Governor and Coun|cil are ve&s;ted with all the powers of the General A&s;&s;em|bly. It is co&s;tly and unpopular to have frequent and long &s;e&s;&s;ions; therefore they &s;hall be few, &s;hort and hurried; and in the mean time, the Governor and Coun|cil &s;hall have a right to do what they judge "the &s;u|preme law," the good of the common-wealth, requires, and no limitation or bounds are to be &s;et to the money they expend, but their &s;overeign judgment of the <HI>qua|tum</HI> of the impending evil; for, "the &s;afety of the people being the &s;upreme law, &s;hould at all events, and

by all means <HI>(but that of calling an a&s;&s;embly togother)</HI> be provided for." This is a &s;hort method to put it in the power of the Governor and Council, to do as they plea&s;e with the men and money of the province; and tho&s;e Governor's who can do as they plea&s;e with the men and money of a country, &s;eem to me to be, (or at lea&s;t are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pretty fair way &s;oon to be) arbitrary; which in plain Engli&s;h means no more than to do as one plea&s;es. As to tho&s;e incon&s;iderable &s;ervices, not worth while to put the province to the charge of an a&s;&s;embly; it &s;eems to be of no great importance whether they are performed or not. 2. There is always an appropriation for contin|gencies, great and &s;mall. If this &s;um &s;hould be exhau&s;t|ed &s;ufficient might always be procured upon the credit of a recommendation from the Governor and Council, for a reimbur&s;ement. 3. Any particular &s;ervice had better &s;uffer, and the province &s;uffer that way, than lo&s;e &s;uch a priviledge as that of taxing them&s;elves; upon which &s;ingle priviledge evidently depends all others, <HI>Civil and Religious.</HI></P>
<P>His Excellency tells us of "the law and u&s;age of every royal government upon the continent;" and that, "in that over which he pre&s;ided formerly, he had upon an emergency, with the advice of the Council only rai&s;ed three hundred men at a time, and marched them to the defence of the frontiers, and when the a&s;&s;embly has met has received their thanks for &s;o doing."</P>
<P>Whether the a&s;&s;embly of this province equal the a&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> in gratitude or any other virtue, I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to determine. But this I am &s;ure of, that this province has been more liberal in their grants to his Excellency, than to any of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors. In&s;tead of any debate about <HI>his &s;alary,</HI> three grants have been made in le&s;s than two years, amount|ing to near three thou&s;and pounds &s;terling in the whole; be&s;ides the very valuable i&s;land of Mount De&s;art, which the province thought they had a right to grant, &s;ubject to his Maje&s;ty's confirmation; and which his Excellency doubtle&s;s will have confirmed to him.
<PB N="40" REF="009225_0039_1030BB38407B5638">
All this with the ordinary perqui&s;ites, be&s;ides the <HI>full third</HI> of all &s;eizures, mu&s;t amount to a very hand&s;ome fortune, obtained in about two years and two months. His Excellency has not been plea&s;ed to tell us, whether the a&s;&s;embly paid the expence of this extraordinary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, or whether the Governor and Council ordered it to be paid? Now if the a&s;&s;embly paid it, as they doubtle&s;s ought, after thanking his Excellency, and thereby ad|mitting the utility of the mea&s;ure, their priviledge was &s;aved. But if the Governor and Council paid it out of the trea&s;ury, and the Hou&s;e acquie&s;ced in the in|fringement of their priviledge, it cannot be produced as a precedent for us, let it be ever &s;o royal a govern|ment. His Excellency has a right to tran&s;port any of the militia of this province to any part of it, by &s;ea or land, for the nece&s;&s;ary defence of the &s;ame: and to build and demoli&s;h &s;orts and ca&s;tles, and with the advice of the council in times of war, to exerci&s;e martial law upon the militia, but then it is with the Hou&s;e to pay the expence, or refu&s;e it as they plea&s;e. No man by charter can be &s;ent out of the province but by an act of the three branches of the legi&s;lature. The King him&s;elf applies to parliament to &s;upport his army and navy, and it is their duty to do it, and they ever have and will do it; and the &s;upplies for the&s;e ever originate in, and are appropriated by the Hou&s;e of Commons; in who&s;e money bills the Hou&s;e of Lords won't pre|&s;ume to make any amendment; con&s;ent or reject in the whole is all the power they exerci&s;e in this particular.</P>
<P>His Excellency next proceeds to &s;tate "the ca&s;e in que&s;tion, "by which I &s;uppo&s;e is meant the facts relative to fitting out the &s;loop Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. The facts mentioned, I take it for granted are in the main true, but the mo&s;t material one &s;eems to be omit|ted, namely, that the Governor and Council made an e&s;tabli&s;hment; in con&s;equence of which the expence of this fitting out or a great part at lea&s;t has been paid out of the Trea&s;ury, by warrant from the Governor and Coun|cil. There is al&s;o a &s;mall mi&s;take in his Excellency's
<PB N="41" REF="009225_0040_1030BB3CA5253378">
&s;aying the &s;loop was then returned. She was expected, but her return was uncertain. Had the &s;loop been &s;ent and the pay or reimbur&s;ement referred to the Hou&s;e, there might have been no complaint as to this particular &s;tep. But the main que&s;tion is not as to the right of &s;ending the &s;loop, but of making, or increa&s;ing her e&s;tabli&s;hment, and paying it out of the publick monies without the con&s;ent of the Hou&s;e; not only in this, but in a number of late &s;imilar in&s;tances, that have indu|ced the Hou&s;e to que&s;tion the right of the Governor and Council to draw monies out of the trea&s;ury in this way. Or more properly, as it re&s;ults from the remon|&s;trance of the Hou&s;e, and his Excellency's vindication: The que&s;tion is in effect, whether the Hou&s;e have a right to appropriate the money they agree to levy upon their con&s;tituents?</P>
<P>It being pretty evident I hope by this time, that if the Governor and Council can i&s;&s;ue what they plea&s;e, <HI>and for what</HI> they plea&s;e, that the Hou&s;e has no right to appropriate; and it is as clear that if the right of ap|propriation is of any avail or &s;ignificancy, the Governor and Council cannot i&s;&s;ue the monies from the trea&s;ury for what they plea&s;e; but are bound and limitted by the appropriations and e&s;tabli&s;hments made by the acts of the province, to which by the way they are two par|ties of three in the making.</P>
<P>His Excellency having given us his &s;tate of the ca&s;e in que&s;tion, proceeds "to apply it to the cen|&s;ure it has met with" as his Excellency is plea&s;ed to expre&s;s it. By which I pre&s;ume his Excellency means the application he had promi&s;ed in the beginning of his vindication.

not &s;o much about the right of fitting out the ve&s;&s;el, as the Governor and Council's right to pay for it out of the trea&s;ury, without the con&s;ent of the Hou&s;e.

<P>I therefore pre&s;ume to read the &s;econd paragraph of his Excellency's vindication according to the &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit, (tho' not &s;trictly agreable to the letter&punc;) thus, "In order to my vindication (dele <HI>to which</HI>) I &s;hall 1.

According to this divi&s;ion, which in the &s;pirit, tho' not in the letter, is a <HI>very good one;</HI> his Excellency has given us his &s;en&s;e of the legal and con&s;titutional pow|ers of the Governor and Council.

This is evidently his Excel|lency's

meaning. The application is mental. The conclu&s;ions are expre&s;s. The fir&s;t his excellency is plea&s;ed to make is in the&s;e words. "This was an act which the Governor with the Council had a right to do." I am no great admirer of the &s;yllogi&s;tic form of rea|&s;oning, and this dre&s;s is very uncourtly. yet all con|clu&s;ive rea&s;oning will bear the te&s;t of the &s;chools. Let us try an experiment. His Excellency's whole vindication may nearly in his own words be reduced to this categoric &s;yllogi&s;m.</P>
<P>"All the money for defreying the charges of the government <HI>is</HI> i&s;&s;ued by warrant of the Governor with the advice of Council, without any further <HI>reference</HI> to the hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives."</P>
<P>The principal merchants in Salem and Marblehead were frighted with a rumour of a privateer: upon their application the Governor and Council took the alarm, fitted out an armed ve&s;&s;el&punc; and by their warrant defrey|ed the charge out of the trea&s;ury without any reference at all to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives."</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. "This was an act which the Governor with the Council had a right to do." No man in his &s;en&s;es to be &s;ure can deny the major propo&s;ition, for the word <HI>is</HI> plainly implies a right; according to <HI>Mr. Pope</HI> and other great authorities, "whatever <HI>is</HI> is right."

<P>His Excellency then proceeds to a&s;k the Hou&s;e a very important que&s;tion.

province, and think I may challenge any man to &s;how any thing in either, that gives the lea&s;t colour of right to the Governor and Council, to fit out an armed ve&s;&s;el to cruize upon the high &s;eas, at the expence of the pro|vince, or to grant a bounty for inli&s;ting the &s;eamen, or to impre&s;s them when they won't inli&s;t fa&s;t enough, as in the ca&s;e of the &s;hip King George, or to make an e&s;tabli&s;hment for the officers and &s;eam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s wages, much le&s;s to i&s;&s;ue the money from the trea&s;ury for defreying the&s;e charges by warrant of the Governor and Council, without any <HI>reference</HI> to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, who mu&s;t upon &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch powers be &s;trangers, total &s;trangers to the expence thus brought upon the province.</P>
<P>But we are told that "<HI>this</HI> is an exertion of the executive power of the government, di&s;tinct from the legi&s;lative."</P>
<P>I am as much for keeping up the di&s;tinction between the executive and legi&s;lative powers as po&s;&s;ible. Hap|py, very happy, would it be for this poor province, if this di&s;tinction was more attended to than it ever yet has been.

and darkne&s;s, unble&s;&s;ed with their influence. I take it for granted therefore, his Excellency mu&s;t mean by "power of the government," not the power of the whole province in great and general court a&s;&s;embled. but only the executive power of the Governor and Council, di&s;tinct from the legi&s;lative, as ju&s;t explained by him. Names are &s;ometimes confounded with things by the wi&s;e&s;t of men. It is however of little impor|tance what the power is called, if the exerci&s;e of it be lawful. If the power of taxing is peculiar to the general a&s;&s;embly, if the charter has confined it to the general a&s;&s;embly, as I think it evidently does, and this act of the Governor and Council is a tax upon every inhabitant, as it clearly is, being paid out of mo|ney rai&s;ed by their repre&s;entatives upon them for other purpo&s;es, which mu&s;t remain un&s;atisfied; and &s;o much more mu&s;t be rai&s;ed upon them as is thus taken away: It follows that as all taxation ought to originate in the Hou&s;e; this act of the Governor and Council is &s;o far from being an executive act peculiar to them, that it is evidently taking upon them in their executive capacity, or what other n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne el&s;e, you are plea&s;ed to give it, a pow|er not only confined by the charter, law and con&s;titution of the province, to the general a&s;&s;embly or legi&s;lative body of the province, but &s;o far confined to one branch of that body, that it can lawfully and con&s;titutionally originate only in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>If therefore this a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> was wrong and ill-advi&s;ed, which I think has been abundantly proved, whether his Ex|cellency will be plea&s;ed to admit it or not: it <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uld</HI> "amount to more than an improper application of the publick money by tho&s;e who have lawful authority to apply &s;uch money to the publick purpo&s;es."

But upon &s;uppo&s;ition the Governor and Council act wrong, and mi&s;apply the monies of the province, which his Excellency &s;eems to concede, is at lea&s;t a po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e. What is to be done? I agree with his Excellency that they are not liable to be called to an account, and it would be a ridiculous vanity and pre&s;umption in the Hou&s;e to think of <HI>any</HI> &s;uch thing. We have no body to in&s;titute a &s;uit again&s;t the Governor and Council; no court to try &s;uch a &s;uit; all that would be left therefore in &s;o un|happy a ca&s;e (if the priviledge of the Hou&s;e of join|ing in all i&s;&s;ues from the trea&s;ury has been given up by former a&s;&s;emblies, and that is binding upon their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, "which I don't mean to admit") is to remon|&s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te. This method the Hou&s;e have taken in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e, rather than at this juncture reclaim their an|cient priviledge of joining in all warrants for the i&s;&s;ues from the trea&s;ury. However, I conceive that the right of joining in &s;uch warrants can never die. But to confine our&s;elves to his Excellency's inferences, let us for a moment concede that this act by the Governor and Council, at mo&s;t is only a mi&s;application of the pub|lick monies. The conduct of the Hou&s;e is certainly to be ju&s;tified. The Governor and Council of the province mi&s;applying money, is a grievous event, a terrible misfortune, and a dreadful example to infe|riors. It would be enough to infect &s;even eighths of the petty officers in the community. Whenever a peculator, great or &s;mall, &s;hould be called to an account after &s;uch an event repeated, and pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed by the Hou&s;e, he would at lea&s;t con&s;ole and comfort, nay even plume him&s;elf with &s;uch like reflections as the&s;e.
<PB N="47" REF="009225_0046_1030BB4F511A24B0">
"My betters have done &s;o before me. They make what applications they plea&s;e of the publick money, without regard to law, or the duty of their tru&s;t, and &s;o will I." Tho' with regard to the pre&s;ent Governor and Council, it is pre&s;umed a mi&s;application can proceed only from an error in judgment, which the wi&s;e&s;t are in a degree &s;ubject to, not from any &s;uppo&s;ed pravity of inclination; yet it would be of dangerous tendency, and therefore a proper &s;ubject of remon&s;trance. A remon&s;trance is not an in&s;olent and pre&s;umptuous "calling a Governor and Council to an account for difference of opinion only", nor any charge of wilful evil, but only of error in judgment, and a humble endeavour to point it out; relying always upon their known goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom, that whenever they &s;hall di&s;cover the truth, they will readily follow it. The Hou&s;e of Com|mons remon&s;trating (as they have &s;ometimes done) I believe would be a&s;toni&s;hed to hear their humble peti|tions to the Throne called <HI>"hard words and groundle&s;s in&s;inuations,</HI> &amp;c. and viewed as calling the King to ac|count. It is true, that the Governor and Council may do many things, if they are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, which they cannot be called to an account for in this world; but this will hardly prove that they have a right to do them, e&s;pecially after the whole body of the people by their Repre&s;entatives complain of them as grievous. It is by no means a good inference in politicks, any more than in private life&punc; or even in a &s;tate of nature, that a man has a right to do every thing in his natural power to do. This would be at once to make a man's own will and his power, however obtained, the only mea&s;ure of his actions.</P>
<P>But in an&s;wer to his Excellency's grand que&s;tion, it will appear that this act&punc; and the like in&s;tances complain|e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of&punc; are more than a bare mi&s;application of the pub|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> money; they are what the hou&s;e called them "a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">thod, (and they might have added a lately devi&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, the fir&s;t in&s;tance almo&s;t being in the ca&s;e of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> King-George, in 1760.) of making and increa&s;ing

<P>His Excellency a&s;ks, "When this di&s;tinction is con|&s;idered, how can this act, right or wrong, be applied to the right of originating taxes, annihilating one branch of the legi&s;lature, and making the government arbitrary." His Excellency, thro' his whole vindication, &s;eems to &s;peak of the &s;ingle act of fitting out the &s;loop, and don't once mention the e&s;tabli&s;hment made for her, or the payment thereof; much le&s;s the two in&s;tances of fitting out the &s;hip King George: All which the hou&s;e had in view, as is manife&s;t by their &s;aying, that, "had this been the fir&s;t in&s;tance, they might not have troubled his Excellency about it." However, if this was the only in&s;tance that ever had happened of &s;uch an exertion of the executive power by the Governor and Council, it &s;eems to be very applicable to the right of originating taxes, and to have a tendency to make the Governor and Council of the province arbitrary. If the Gover|nor and Council have a right to draw what money they plea&s;e out of the trea&s;ury, under a notion of di&s;cretion which they are to exerci&s;e, as executive officers of the government; it follows, that for &s;o much charge as the government incurs, by the exerci&s;e of this di&s;cretionary power, by &s;o much the province is taxed by the Gover|nor and Council, without any privity or con&s;ent of the hou&s;e; &s;o much charge then as is incurred by this di&s;|cretionary power, the hou&s;e cannot be &s;aid to originate. Their right of originating taxes therefore is &s;o far taken away; their power as to this cea&s;ing and coming to no|thing, by the Governor and Council exerci&s;ing it them|&s;elves, without the hou&s;e, may be &s;aid to be annihilated.
<PB N="49" REF="009225_0048_1030BB56E80E5D30">
And when the power and priviledge of any branch of the legi&s;lature cea&s;es, is taken away and annihilated, then the government is &s;o far arbitrary. The hou&s;e are &s;o mode&s;t as only to &s;ay, "that in &s;uch a ca&s;e it will &s;oon become arbitrary."</P>
<P>Can any man be &s;o unrea&s;onable as to contend that the province is not as much taxed by the Governor and Council's paying for this &s;loop out of the money already rai&s;ed, as if the hou&s;e had voted it? What is the diffe|rence? The people pay the reckoning whether the Governor and Council take upon them to arm ve&s;&s;els out of money rai&s;ed for other purpo&s;es, or the hou&s;e vote to rai&s;e money for arming ve&s;&s;els. When the money is gone out of the trea&s;ury for arming, ve&s;&s;els, the debts of the province contracted by the three branches of the legi&s;lature mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be paid, and other monies mu&s;t be levied in&s;tead of tho&s;e taken away by the Go|vernor and Council. And as according to his Excellen|cy's di&s;tinction. there is no limitation of the di&s;cretiona|ry expence, &s;o long as the good of the whole, in the opinion of the Governor and Council &s;hall require it; they may &s;pend every farthing in the trea&s;ury, and for what they plea&s;e. Suppo&s;e his Excellency &s;hould judge it expedient and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary upon the apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome imminent and immediate dan|ger (of which he is in fact ab&s;olutely by the charter the &s;ole judge) to march all the militia to the frontiers. This he can do without even the advice of the Council. Suppo&s;e the Council, tho' not con&s;ulted, as they need not be, as to the utility of the march, &s;hould place &s;uch ab&s;olute confidence in his Excellency's wi&s;dom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;ign a warrant for drawing every farthing out of the trea&s;ury for the paying and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting this armament.

<P>The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, &s;hould they pre&s;ume to remon&s;trate, might with the &s;ame propriety be given to under&s;tand that "there was not time to call <HI>them</HI> together", that "the danger was immed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">te and immi|nent,

and in &s;uch a ca&s;e there is no limitation of ex|pence, but in proportion to the evil impending;" "for the &s;afety of the people being the &s;upreme law, &s;hould at all events be provided for." Furthermore, "this was an act the Governor and Council had a right to do:" "It is a legal and con&s;titutional ex|erci&s;e of the powers ve&s;ted in them". "It is an ex|ertion of the executive power of the government, di&s;tinct from the legi&s;lative." Nay let us go but one &s;tep further, and I think the rea&s;oning will be compleat on the &s;ide of his Excellency, or on the &s;ide of the Hou&s;e. All things are po&s;&s;ible, and when his Excellency and the Council we are now ble&s;&s;ed with, are taken from us, we may have a Governor and Council, that after they have given out orders to array and march the militia, and by warrant drawn all the money out of the trea&s;ury, may alter their minds as to the imminent danger, lay by the expedition, but in&s;tead of replacing the money in the trea&s;ury, divide and pocket it among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The reader no doubt &s;tarts at &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, 'tis only a bare po&s;&s;ibility as &s;tated. The Hou&s;e might po&s;&s;ibly remon&s;trate in &s;uch a ca&s;e. But I hold that upon the principles advanced by his Excellency, it would be wrong in them &s;o to do, and that it ought to be taken for a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, That "if it were wrong and ill advi&s;ed in the Governor and Council (thus to convert all the trea&s;ure of the province to their own u&s;e, which they might not mean to admit) yet it would amount to no more than a <HI>very improper appli|cation</HI> of the publick money, by tho&s;e who had lawful authority to apply &s;uch money to the publick purpo&s;es."</P>

Nor is any new priviledge given by this act to the natives of the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onies, it is meerly as to them a declaration of what they are intitled to by the common law, by their &s;everal charters, by the law of nature and nations, and by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aw of God, as might be &s;hown at large, had I time or r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om.</P>
<P>All &s;ettled attempts therefore, again&s;t the libe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty of the &s;ubject, in any of the plantations, mu&s;t end in the ruin of the Governor who makes them; at lea&s;t they will render his admini&s;tration as unea&s;y to him&s;elf, as unhappy for the people. It is therefore the indi&s;pen&s;a|ble duty of every one, and will be the &s;incere endea|vour of every hone&s;t man, to promote the utmo&s;t har|mony between the three branches of the legi&s;lature, that they may be a mutual &s;upport to each other, and the ornament, defence and glory of the people Provi|dence has committed to their care.</P>
<P>I am convinced that if his Excellency will in al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ca&s;es take the advice of the general a&s;&s;embly, (which how|ever contemptably &s;ome may affect to &s;peak of it, is the great council of this province, as the Briti&s;h par|liament is of the kingdom) that his admini&s;tration will be crowned with all the &s;ucce&s;s he can de&s;ire. But if in&s;tead of this, the advice of half a dozen or half a &s;core, who among their fellow citizens may be chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed by their avarice, ignorance, pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> or in|&s;olence, &s;hould at any time obtain too muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eight at court, the con&s;equences will be very unfortunate on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>Had the writer of the&s;e &s;heets any thing to a&s;k or fear from his Excellency, for him&s;elf, a very &s;lender modern politician would quickly perceive the incompa|tability of this performance with a court intere&s;t. That he has done every thing he could in his &s;mall &s;phere to make his Excellency's admini&s;tration pro&s;perous to him and happy for the people, abundant proofs have been given: and they will one day be convincing to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ex|cellency.
