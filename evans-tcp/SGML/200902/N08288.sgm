<HEAD>INTRODUCTION BY WAY OF PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING lived for divers Years among&s;t Friends, and frequently read divers of their Epi&s;tles and other Writings, and &s;eeing &s;everal of their Practices Corre&s;pond, cau&s;ed me to think they were nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly the People they pro&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to be; and thereupon having contract|ed a particular Acquaintance with their Forms and Cu&s;toms, could not but he in Love with the Principle by them pro&s;e&s;&s;ed, when as it were of a &s;udden, there appeared &s;omething of a U&s;urpation, I believe I may call it, tho' I would Term it in the mo&s;t moderate way I could, be it what it may; it appeared in &s;o &s;trange a Dre&s;s and Language, that it was immediately taken Notice of, and altho' &s;everal very well minded Per&s;ons kept their Places, yet it was near cau&s;ing a Change in this &s;o valuable a Government for its happy Privileges; at which Time there was a concern on my Mind to revive &s;ome of the following Collection; (but ju&s;t at the &s;ame Time, as I make no doubt, there were divers con|cern'd for the welfare of the People, and the valuable Con&s;titution, there appeared a &s;mall Tract intituled, <HI>The Chri&s;tians Duty,</HI> to render unto <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> the Things that are <HI>Cae&s;ar's</HI>) which appeared to have been &s;o well penn'd, that I imagined it would be almo&s;t needle&s;s for any Thing more to have been &s;aid.</P>
<P>But as in mo&s;t Ca&s;es, tho&s;e who pro&s;e&s;s a Scheme, e&s;pecially if they be &s;uch as look upon them&s;elves as of the foremo&s;t Rank, don't care to &s;ee or hear of any Thing, which they apprehend will dimini&s;h or le&s;&s;en the Credit of their Propo&s;als, wherefore divers of tho&s;e that had under|taken the Schi&s;m, neglecting no Opportunity of cultivating their Schi&s;ma|tical Propo&s;als, were very indu&s;trious in urging their own Opinions, and there it rea&s;on to believe, being Con&s;cious, that who&s;oever read and con|&s;idered the afore&s;aid Chri&s;tian Duty, mu&s;t be of Opinion, that to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> therefrom, would look like joining with the Seeds of Sedition. I &s;ay from tho&s;e Con&s;iderations, its likely tho&s;e who had undertaken the U&s;urpa|tion, might e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">deavour to &s;ecret the afore&s;aid &s;mall Tracts that were publi&s;hed, as they appeared to be very much unkno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n for &s;ome Years in divers Places, &s;carcely any in many Parts of the Country who knew of any &s;uch Thing, and being repeatedly, urged to comply with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mo|delled Injunctions; which being taken Notice of by &s;ome Well wi&s;hers of the common Wealth, they promoted the Re printing of the &s;aid Chri&s;tians Duty to render unto <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> the Things that are <HI>Cae&s;ar's,</HI> which now in|deed

is more Publick; yet neverthele&s;s by their Vigilance, Indu&s;try, and boldly appointing, and as rejolutely pur&s;uing their Scheme, divers weak People have been drawn into a Compliance in Part of their Notions; and others there are who are, as may be term'd, Lukewarm in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, and rather than contend, will hold their Peace, whereby tho&s;e that have undertaken thus to u&s;urp the Authority of introducing new Mattters and Forms, have &s;o far encouraged them&s;elves, as in Effect to pre&s;ume an Alteration in the civil Government Affairs.</P>
<P>Oh! I wi&s;h this may be well con&s;idered; its not my de&s;ign to write my Sentiments on this Subject at this Time, but cannot help ob&s;erving that it &s;eems a mo&s;t unhappy Time: Well, under the Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e Things, and for the good Will and E&s;teem I have bad, and &s;till retain for tho&s;e People, and the many ine&s;timable Priviledges we have enjoyed in this Province, owing chiefly to the happy Con&s;titution and good Govern|ment thereof, I wi&s;h we may &s;ufficiently Prize it.</P>
<P>Well, as divers Friends have wrote &s;ufficiently clear, both in re&s;pect of Government, and in regard of Cu&s;toms and Tribute, I have taken the pains to collect &s;ome few out of &s;uch unexceptionable Authors, and I flatter my&s;elf you will not think your Time ill &s;pent, in comparing their Senti|ments with tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent high Profe&s;&s;ors, and con&s;ider the Authori|ties, and examine whether there is not &s;ome Incon&s;i&s;tencies, and &s;ee whether you can reconcile the Matters; if not, which mu&s;t be received, and which rejected, for I would not that any People &s;hould be &s;o un&s;et|tled in Matters of Faith, as to be ready to follow every new Opinion let it come under ever &s;uch a &s;anctified Appellation, remembring the Words of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in that Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>If the Profe&s;&s;ors of that Society, will candily con&s;ider the following Collection, and govern them&s;elves accordingly, it will I pre&s;ume redound to their Peace of Mind, and Satisfaction of the Publick, and be a &s;uffici|ent Recompen&s;e to a Friend and Wellwi&s;her of this once happy Con&s;titu|tion, and Mankind in General.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my Heart has been often pained with the Pro&s;pect of Things, which are likely to hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t us as a religious Society, and mo&s;t deeply &s;o at hearing that &s;ome Friends in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> a&s;&s;ert, that they cannot, for Con&s;cience Sake pay the pre&s;ent Tax; I take the Freedom to commit &s;ome Thoughts to Writing on the Subject, which thou may (if thou thinke&s;t thee may be of any Service in it) communicate to &s;ome who are &s;aid to be the Leaders in that Sen|timent, for &s;everal of whom I have a mo&s;t &s;incere Regard. I per|&s;wade my&s;elf neither thou nor they will expect a fini&s;hed E&s;&s;ay, where the Intention is &s;imple and hone&s;t. A few Mi&s;takes (if &s;uch &s;hould appear) will, by the Candid, meet with a favourable Con&s;truction. Truth will bear the Te&s;t of a few and impartial En|quirers; and tho&s;e who &s;eek it &s;incerely will be plea&s;ed to meet with any Objections which carry Light and Information in them. And as on one Hand all &s;itting and due Regard ought to be paid to con|&s;cientious Scruples, &s;o on the other Hand, the utmo&s;t Care &s;hould be taken, that nothing is received in the Church as a Matter of Faith and Practice, or be approved by the Society as &s;uch, without proper Evidence and Demon&s;tration; otherwi&s;e the Church or Community may e&s;pou&s;e Articles of Faith which cannot be &s;up|ported, neither the Members be able to render a Rea&s;on of the Hope that is in them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Law was for rai&s;ing 55000 &pound;. for the King's U&s;e; the next, for the further Sum of 100,000 &pound; for the &s;ame U&s;e: But let it fir&s;t be con&s;iderd, what can be advanced as &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons for us to pay all Taxes for the Support of Government, and then the Objections that are made to the&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t in Cour&s;e is that in <HI>Mat.</HI> xxii. 17. and <HI>Mark</HI> xii. 14. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a memorable Pa&s;&s;age related by &s;everal of the Evangeli&s;ts when the <HI>Herodians</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> joined in putting the Que&s;tion to our Lord, What thinke&s;t thou? is it lawful to give Tribute un|to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> or not? It appears from the Account that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> gives of the State of the Jews at that Time, that tho&s;e two Parties, <HI>He|rodians</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> included almo&s;t the whole Nation; one of them alledged, that they were forbid by God to acknowledge any Sovereign Power but God only; and that it would be therefore very wrong in them to pay Tribute to an Heathen Emperor: The
<PB N="5" REF="010583_0005_0F80F1CB07B01BF0">
other Party alledged, that as they were brought under the <HI>Roman,</HI> Yoke, it would be the wi&s;e&s;t Cour&s;e they could take to &s;ubmit pati|ently thereto. This religious Di&s;pute ran very high with them on their putting the afore&s;aid Que&s;tion to our Lord. He bid them &s;hew him the Tribute Money, and a&s;ked who&s;e Image and Super|&s;cription it had? They &s;ay unto him Cae&s;ar's. Then faith he unto them, Render unto Cae&s;ar the Things that are Cae&s;ar's, and unto God the Things that are God's. That this was clearly the Will of our Lord, appears by his own Practice when at Capernaum, where he wrought a Miracle to enable <HI>Peter</HI> to pay Tribute for them both, and giveth a weighty Rea&s;on, left we &s;hould offend them. And that the Apo&s;tles, immediate Followers of our Lord, under|&s;tood this indi&s;putably to be his Mind, appears from their being uniformly in the &s;ame Practice; for there is not (or I have not met with) one In&s;tance of their being charged with the contrary: And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> in the 13th Chapter of <HI>Romans,</HI> is very clear in &s;everal Ver&s;es, particularly the 6th, "For this Cau&s;e pay we Tribute." Heretofore the Example and Precepts of our Lord have appeared &s;o &s;trong, that I &s;hould not have &s;crupled, &s;aying with the Apo&s;tle, "If any Man teach otherwi&s;e, and con&s;ent not to whole&s;ome Words, even the Words of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he is proud, knowing nothing, but doating about Que&s;tions and Strifs of Words, <HI>&amp;c."</HI> But as I believe &s;ome concerned in the pre&s;ent Matter are de&s;irous of di&s;charging a good Con&s;cience, I &s;er|vently de&s;ire to treat them with Gentlene&s;s. It is well known to all who are acquainted with the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tory, that the Govern|ment to which our Lord paid Tribute was a military Government, with indeed all that was left of the civil Power, which was but a Shadow included in one Sea&s;on, for it was an u&s;urped ab&s;olute Monarchy at that Time, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by <HI>Tiberius,</HI> one of the mo&s;t wicked Men that ever reigned.&mdash;But let us come to our Brethrens Objections. The Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation, &s;ay &s;ome, was not com|menced, the Son of God not being offered up, and therefore his paying Taxes may be an&s;wered as fulfilling the Law, or being un|der the legal Di&s;pen&s;ation. If it be con&s;idered, that the Tribute was paid to an Heathen, and that no &s;uch Payment was never de|rived by the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> our Lord's Conduct cannot, with any Propriety, be under&s;tood to fullfil the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Law, becau&s;e, in this In&s;tance, it was no ways relative thereto. Our ancient Friends, tho&s;e Glorious Sons of the Morning, in <HI>London,</HI> have, from time to time, frequently publi&s;hed to the World, That they were a People that freely pay all Taxes for the Support of Go|vernment; and u&s;ually, in Addre&s;&s;es to the King, or Applications to the Parliament, have &s;et Faith out chearfully, paying their Du|ties, Cu&s;tom, and Taxes to the Crown, by which, having demon|&s;trated their Loyalty and Subjection, thought them&s;elves intitled to the Indulgence and protection of the Crown. It hath been &s;aid, that Friends in <HI>England</HI> refu&s;ed to pay Trophy Money, and that the
<PB N="6" REF="010583_0006_0F80F1CFAC9E2268">
Tax here is more like that than Government Taxes. This natural|ly led me to enquire into the Nature of the Trophy Money; as the In|telligence was convey'd in Writing, and contains &s;everal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Di&s;tinctions, I &s;ubjoin it in my Friend's Words, "We as a Chri&s;ti|an Society, gathered into the true Spirit of the Go&s;pel, and un|der the ble&s;&s;ed Government of the Prince of Peace, who&s;e King|dom is not of this World; we have a clear and &s;trong Te&s;timony to bear again&s;t Wars and Blood&s;hed; we cannot appear our&s;elves in Per|&s;on, as <HI>Soldiers, Military</HI> Men, nor can we hire one another to go or &s;erve to our &s;tead, neither comply with the Payment of any Fine to procur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> another Man to &s;upply our Place, for the&s;e Things being per&s;onal, would, we conceive, be an indirect Violation of the Pre|cepts of the Go&s;pel, and contrary to the Spirit thereof; and for the &s;ame Cau&s;e, we have not complied with that Tax called a Trophy Tax, that Tax being in&s;tead of, or to &s;upply the Diffici|ency in former Laws relative to the <HI>Militia,</HI> which had not made due Provi&s;ions for &s;upplying the Officers with <HI>Guns, Drums, Colours</HI> and other <HI>Military</HI> Attire, but was to impower or authorize Towns, Boroughs, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, to rai&s;e up <HI>Militia</HI> in Ca&s;e of a Rebellion or In&s;ur|rections; and the Trophy Tax was impo&s;ed to rai&s;e Money to purcha&s;e <HI>Guns</HI> and <HI>Drums</HI> for the <HI>Militia,</HI> which being per&s;onal, and not a Tax for the &s;upport of Government, the Society has always bore a Te&s;timony again&s;t the Payment thereof."</P>
<P>That it is not a Publick Tax for the &s;upport of Government is clear, no Account is ever rendered thereof to the King's Mi|ni&s;try, nor the Parliament; it is not paid into the Trea&s;ury, nor rai&s;ed annually in the Nation, but in particular Places as Occa&s;i|on may require, and relates to the <HI>Militia</HI> only.&mdash;But to proceed with our Bretherns Objections, when the Matter was under Con&s;i|deration, at the Time an Epi&s;tle on the Subject was Signed by &s;e|veral Friends, it was urged as the Principal Inducement to that Step, by tho&s;e who had the greate&s;t Weight in that Conference, that the Members of our Society were a Majority in the A&s;&s;embly, and ought not to have voted Money for Warlike Purpo&s;es, but to have &s;tood firm to the Te&s;timony, and not deviate therefrom; and our freely paying that Tax would be joining with them in that De|fection: This had great Weight with Friends on that Occa&s;ion, who had been long pained in Mind, on Account of the Conduct of &s;ome Friends in the A&s;&s;embly; but is it not evident that this Ob|jection again&s;t paying the fir&s;t Tax is removed, re&s;pecting the &s;econd, <HI>viz.</HI> a Majority of our Profe&s;&s;ion in the A&s;&s;embly, and the la&s;t being laid by other People; and tho' it may be called a Supplement, or Graft on the old R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot, yet that Supplement or Craft was not made by tho&s;e who profe&s;s with us, nor can it be proved that the fir&s;t was a Cau&s;e of, or produced the &s;econd; there being no Room to &s;uppo&s;e; but the late Money Bill would have pa&s;&s;ed, had there been none before, the Crown having demand|ed that Provi&s;ion &s;hould be made, for the defence of the Province.
<PB N="7" REF="010583_0007_0F80F1D1F8BBF0E8">
The Appropriating any Part of this Money, by tho&s;e who are intru&s;ted with it, to Purpo&s;es we do not approve of, cannot I think be in&s;i&s;ted on as an Argument again&s;t our paying it, at lea&s;t not by tho&s;e who allow the Example of our Lord and his Follow|ers to be of any Weight. They did not, that we have any Infor|mation of at all, enquire into the U&s;es, which the Governor would make of their Money; and it never can be applied to wor&s;e Pur|po&s;es than was common in tho&s;e Governments. If it be granted (as it readily will) that the Legi&s;lator have Power to levy Taxes, or alienate a Part of the E&s;tate of the Subjects to the U&s;e and Pur|po&s;es of the Crown; and when they have &s;o done, Is not &s;o much Cae&s;ars Due, or Right, and the legal Property of the Crown? the Subject &s;ays no, it is yet his. Does not the Subject who &s;o refu&s;es, depart from his Allegiance, and deny Subjection, contrary to the Apo&s;tolick Injunction? But to this may be objected, we don't pay Tythes, and they are enjoined by Law. Tythes were origi|nally &s;aid to be given to God, and the Holy Church, not by ci|vil, but by eccle&s;ia&s;tick Power, and were claimed as due by Di|vin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Right, and are for the &s;upport of an Antichri&s;tian Mini&s;try, and were afterwards only confirmed by Law; they were not given to Cae&s;ar nor claimed by him, being deem'd to relate to Spiritual Things; and as Spiritual Things, or Matters relating to the Church of Chri&s;t, are not in the Power of the civil Magi&s;trates, but ap|pertain to God only, &s;o there is no Parity between the Payment of Taxes for the Support of Government, and the Payment of Tythes for the Support of an Hireling Mini&s;ter: by the fir&s;t we comply with what is in the Power of the civil Magi&s;trates to en|join as God's Mini&s;ters, but a Compliance with the latter, would be to give him God's Due, which is Addoration and Wor&s;hip; and Cae&s;ar is not to have them both, but one only, <HI>viz.</HI> his Cu|&s;tom, his Tribute. Thus we may render to Cae&s;ar the Things that are Cae&s;ars, and unto God the Things that are God's. Seeing then all outward Evidence, both Precept and Example, favour the Payment of Taxes, for the Support of Government, upon what Foundation can the Scruple ari&s;e? Why, &s;ay &s;ome, we are not ea&s;y to pay the Pre&s;ent Tax: We &s;hould bring a Load on our Minds if we did; and we apprehend we have a Revelation of &s;ome Things more than has heretofore been di&s;covered, or a Call to bear a clearer Te&s;timony again&s;t War than was ever yet Done. But would it not be Prudent in the&s;e Friends to con&s;ider, that as this Manner of Scrupling is not warranted by Scripture Rea&s;on, nor the Practice of the faithful in all Ages, it calls for a &s;erious Re-con&s;ideration, in what Manner their Mi&s;&s;ion can be proved. New Revelation, if it be received by others, mu&s;t carry new Evi|dences, and very &s;trong Ones the&s;e ought to be to convince ho|ne&s;t Minds, that they may &s;afely leave the Example of their Lord and Ma&s;ter, and act directly contrary thereto: And may not, by the &s;ame Means now propo&s;ed, I mean Pretences to further Light,

the mo&s;t ab&s;urd Opinions be introduced into the Society, as Articles of Faith, if the Precept and Practice of Chri&s;t, and his immediate followers, and our worthy Elders, are not to be admit|ted as &s;ufficient Bars to &s;uch Pretences.</P>
<P>My De&s;ires are &s;o earne&s;t, that what I look upon as an Extream in tho&s;e our Brethren may be &s;toped, that it occa&s;ions much Matter to flow into my Mind, to offer to their Con&s;ideration; but Time at Pre&s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> will not admit of much further.</P>
<P>And Oh! that I could hope there may never be Occa&s;ion to &s;ay more on the Subject; but however that may be, I cannot conclude without this Remark, Ought, or is it con&s;i&s;tent for any Member of our Society to embrace any Thing, or practice any Scruple, whereby the whole Body may be affected, without fir&s;t con&s;ulting, or having the concurrent Sentiment of their Brethren in Society, (I mean the whole Society) as we are one People, and profe&s;s one Univer&s;al Spirit the World over? May not a Prac|tice, contrary to this, by a Per&s;on in the Society, under any Pre|tences what&s;oever, promote Independency, and introduce Anarchy, whereby the Body may be &s;plit into Parties; which is contrary to the true Nature and End of the Society.</P>

I an&s;wered, &s;o we do, when we are fully &s;en&s;ible of it, e&s;pecially to Kings and Princes; for though we have laid a&s;ide and decline all vain and empty Shews of re&s;pect and Duty, and flattering Titles, whereby they are generally deceived, by in&s;in|cere and de&s;igning Men, who &s;eem to admire them for their own Ends; yet we yield all due and &s;incere Re&s;pect and Duty to &s;uch, and all in Authority under them, by giving ready Obedience to all their lawful Commands: But when at any Time any of them, either through Tyranny or Ignorance, or ill Coun&s;el, happens to Command any Thing contrary to our Duty to the Almighty, or his Chri&s;t our Lord; then we offer our Prayers and Tears to God, and humble Addre&s;&s;es unto &s;uch Rulers that their Under|&s;tandings may be opened, and their Minds changed towards us.</P>
<P>The Czar gave no reply to this, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alked with his Inter|preter again, who then a&s;ked of what U&s;e can you be in any Kingdom or Government, &s;eeing you will not bear Arms and fight?

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO you all in <HI>Nevis,</HI> and the <HI>Carribee-I&s;lands</HI> thereabouts. I have &s;een a Letter from &s;ome of you, wherein I under|&s;tand
<PB N="12" REF="010583_0012_0F80F1D587AC4778">
that there has been &s;ome Scruple concerning watching or &s;ending forth Watchmen in your own Way.</P>
<P>Truly, Friends, this I declare to you, that it is a great Mercy of the Lord, to &s;ubject the Governor's Mind &s;o much by his Power and Truth, that he will permit you to watch in your own Way, without carrying Arms, which is a very civil Thing, and to be taken Notice of. For could Friends obtain the &s;ame in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and other Places, they would willingly have done it, and did proffer them&s;elves for to do it to the Governors; but becau&s;e that they would not bring Swords and Guns, and other Arms, to watch again&s;t the Spaniards as they pretended, their &s;tanding Fine was about Seventeen Shillings each Man's Neglect, but they took of|ten Thirty Shillings Worth for it, and tied &s;ome of them Neck and Heels be&s;ides, till the Blood hath come forth at their Mouths, No&s;e and Ears; and this I have &s;een upon Record, who freely proffered to watch in their own Way, but it would not be accep|ted, and in other Places it hath been the &s;ame.</P>
<P>And now, as for watching in it&s;elf, Don't you watch your Plan|tations again&s;t Thieves in the Night? And are not common Watches &s;et to di&s;cover Thieves in the Towns, or Hou&s;e-breakers, or &s;uch as might wickedly Fire Hou&s;es? Such civil Things we were &s;ubject to, and do &s;ubmit our&s;elves for Con&s;cience Sake, unto every &s;uch Ordinance of Man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich are for the Puni&s;hment of evil Doers, and for the Prai&s;e of them that do well.</P>
<P>Now tho&s;e evil Doers, that may rob your Plantations or Hou&s;es, you complain to the Magi&s;trates for the Puni&s;hment of them, tho' you cannot &s;wear again&s;t them; or if the <HI>Indians</HI> come to rob your Plantations or Hou&s;es, you complain to the Magi&s;trates for the Puni&s;hment of &s;uch evil Doers, to &s;top them, which Magi&s;trates are for the Prai&s;e of them that do well; &s;o this watching is for the preventing Thieves and Murderers, and &s;toping burning of Hou&s;es: So we do &s;ubmit to every &s;uch Ordinance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">len for the Lord's Sake. For the Apo&s;tle Exhorteth to Submi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whe|ther it be to King as Supreme, or Governors, as unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">em that are &s;ent by him, for the Puni&s;hment of the evil Doers, and for the Prai&s;e of them that do well; for &s;o it is the Will of God, that with well-doing you might put to Silence the Ignorance of fooli&s;h Men, as free, not u&s;ing your Liberty for a Cloak of Maliciou&s;ne&s;s, but as Servants of God; &s;o that Ju&s;tice, Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s may be &s;et upon the Unrighteous and Unju&s;t, not u&s;ing this Liberty for a Cloak of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s to any one, but as Servants in the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Righteous God, as you may &s;ee in 1 <HI>Peter</HI> 2, 13. and in <HI>Titus</HI> 3, 1. Put them in mind to obey Magi&s;trates, and to be ready to every good Work. Mark (every good Work) that is again&s;t the evil, as Drunkenne&s;s, Murder, Whoredom, the&s;e and all Manner of Uncleanne&s;s; &s;o far we can obey them, in the Lord's Power and Truth, as they act again&s;t the evil, and that which Di&s;honours God: And if they act again&s;t the good; or if

they would Compa&s;s as to tho&s;e Things, which is Matter of Con|&s;cience in us towards God, we re&s;i&s;t not, but &s;uffer under them; for Rulers are not to be a Terror to the good Workers, but to the evil, and wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power; do that which is good, and thou &s;halt have Prai&s;e of the &s;ame, for he is a Mini&s;ter of God to thee for good, for he &s;hould ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> down the evil, but if thou do&s;t that which is evil, be afraid, for he beareth not the Sword in vain, for he is a Mini&s;ter of God, to revenge and execute Wrath upon him that doth evil. So he is the Revenger and Executioner of the Wrath upon the evil Doer, as God hath placed him upon the Adulterer, and him that &s;teals or kills, and bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fal&s;e Witne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But when the Magi&s;trate turns his Sword backward upon the Ju&s;t and Righteous, then he abu&s;es his Power, and therein the Ju&s;t &s;uffers under him; and therefore, &s;uch has been warned by the Ju&s;t, as you may &s;ee through the Scriptures. So you are not to be the Revengers, but he is the Revenger; and to that Power that executes the Revenge, and brings the Sword upon the Adulterer, Murderer, Thief, fal&s;e Witne&s;s, and other evil Doers, we mu&s;t be &s;ubject to that Power, and own that Power; not only for Wrath, but for Con&s;cience Sake; which is for the Puni&s;hment of the evil Doers, and the Prai&s;e of them that do well. For if any &s;hould come to burn your Hou&s;e, or rob you, or come to ravi&s;h your Wives or Daughters, or a Company &s;hould come to fire a City or Town, or come to kill Peo|ple, Don't you watch again&s;t all &s;uch Actions? And won't you watch again&s;t &s;uch evil Things, in the Power of God, in your own Way? You cannot but di&s;cover &s;uch Things to the Magi|&s;trates, who are to puni&s;h &s;uch Things: And therefore the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tch is kept and &s;et to di&s;cover &s;uch to the Magi&s;trates, that they may be puni&s;hed; and if he does it not, he bears his Sword in Vain. So if thou watches thy own Plantation again&s;t Thieves in thy own Way, which thou art de&s;ired, for the good of thy&s;elf and Neighbours, again&s;t &s;uch as would burn thy Plantation, and thy Neighb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and de&s;troy and rob you; Wilt not thou di&s;cover this to the Magi|&s;trates, to puni&s;h &s;uch evil Doers, who is &s;et for the puni&s;hing of the evil Doers, and executing Wrath upon them, and for the Prai&s;e of them that do well? Surely yes. And for this Cau&s;e we pay Tribute to them, and gives Cae&s;ar his Due, that we may live a godly and peaceable Life under them, as they are God's Mini&s;ters, attending upon this very Thing, to wit, the puni&s;h|ing of the evil Doers, and the Prai&s;e of them that do well; for the Law was not made for the Righteous; but for the Sinner and Di&s;obedient, which is good in its place.</P>
<P>Now if they do not do their Duty, we are clear in giving them their Tribute or Cu&s;toms; I &s;ay, if they do not do their Duty to keep down evil Doers, and be for the Prai&s;e of them that do well, God Almighty will turn again&s;t them. But if the Magi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e would have all, both God's Due and Cae&s;ar's too, that we cannot

give, for God mu&s;t have his Wor&s;hip, his Prai&s;e, his Honours, and his Due; and Cae&s;ar mu&s;t have his Due, his earthly Cu&s;tom and Tribute; and &s;o herein, we render unto God the Things which are God's, and unto Cae&s;ar the Things which are his. And where|as &s;ome may &s;ay, that the Apo&s;tle, would not eat Fle&s;h, le&s;t he &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fend his Brother; that was upon a religious Account, and not to give Offence to the Magi&s;trate, who is &s;et for the pu|ni&s;hing of the evil Doers, and for the Prai&s;e of them that do well.</P>
<P>And whereas the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>Col.</HI> 2. Wherefore if you be dead with Chri&s;t, from the Rudiments of the World, why, as though living in the World, are ye &s;ubject to Ordinances, touch not, ta&s;te not, handle not, which all are to peri&s;h with the u&s;ing, after the Commandments and Doctrines of Men? Now the&s;e Or|dinances, the&s;e Doctrines, the&s;e Commandments, were concerning Religion and Wor&s;hip: And that was another Thing, where the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, be &s;ubject to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's Sake, which was for the Prai&s;e of them that do well, and for the Puni&s;hment of the evil Doer. So he makes Di&s;tinction here. And you know that Ma&s;ters of Ships, and Friends have their Watches all Night long; and they watch to pre&s;erve the Ship, and to prevent any Enemy or Hurts that might come to the Ship, by Pa&s;&s;engers or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>And Chri&s;t came in the fourth Watch of the Night, walk|ing on the Sea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And <HI>Peter</HI> was in the Ship, and his Di&s;|ciples, as you may &s;ee i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Matthew</HI> 14, and in <HI>Mark</HI> 6, and 48. And <HI>Simon Peter</HI> had Part of the Ship, as you may &s;ee in <HI>Luke</HI> 5. And &s;o it was, that <HI>James</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> Sons of, <HI>Zebedee,</HI> were Partners with <HI>Simon.</HI> And Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>Luke</HI> xii. 38, 39, &s;peak|ing of his coming, and exhorting to watch, if he (<HI>to wit,</HI> the Ma&s;ter) &s;hould come in the 2d or 3d Watch, and find them watching, ble&s;&s;ed are the&s;e Servants. So this watching was for Chri&s;t, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> again&s;t Sin and Evil in their own Hearts. And then he brings a Compari&s;on; And this know, that if the good Man of the Hou&s;e, &s;aid he, had known, what Hour the Thief would come, he would have watched, and not &s;uffered his Hou&s;e to be broken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">. And &s;o here is the good Man's watching again&s;t Sin and Evil without, and the Spoiler and Thief without, whom the Magi&s;trate is to revenge, and to lay his Sword upon. And here is al&s;o a watching again&s;t Sin and Evil within, and a waiting to receive Chri&s;t the Lord at his coming.</P>
<P>And as there is a &s;hutting the outward Doers, to keep out the Murderers and the Thieves, and a bolting and locking them out; &s;o there is a &s;huting up, and locking the Door of the Heart, to keep out the Adulterer and Murderer, and all that is deceitful, from coming within into the Heart.</P>
<P>And Friends, the Prie&s;ts and Profe&s;&s;ors u&s;ed to bring this Scrip|ture, "You mu&s;t be &s;ubject to every Ordinance of Man, for the
<PB N="15" REF="010583_0015_0F80F1D805A15090">
Lord's Sake, to the end that we &s;hould pay them their Mainte|nance, and hold up their Wor&s;hip.&mdash;And when the Magi&s;trates brought that Scripture for the&s;e Ends, we could not obey them in the&s;e Things, nor touch, nor ta&s;te their Ordinances, Doctrines nor Commandments; but to be &s;ubject to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's Sake, which was for the Puni&s;hment of evil Doers, as Drunkards, Thieves, Murderers, Adulterers, and &s;uch like, and to keep down &s;uch evil Doers, and that we might live a godly and peaceable Life under them, which was for the Prai&s;e of them that do well, this we always owned, and were &s;ubject to, and watched again&s;t, and declared again&s;t in our own Way, and laid &s;uch Actors and Actions before the Magi&s;trates, for them to puni&s;h, and keep down with their Power, which is their Sword of Ju&s;tice; but if they would compel us to Things that we could not do, contra|ry to our Con&s;cience, for the Lord's Sake, we &s;uffered for it. So where Friends has the Government, as in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> and that Province, Friends was willing to watch, in their own Way; and they made a Law that none &s;hould be compelled to take Arms. So Friends have always proffered the Magi&s;trates, though they could not join with them in carrying Arms, Swords and Pi&s;tols; yet to watch in their own Way, again&s;t the evil Doers.</P>
<P>And this they have proffered in <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> as I have heard, to di&s;cover if Negroes &s;hould ri&s;e up to burn Plantations, or &s;teal, or do any hurt, or other Indians invading their Land.</P>
<P>And &s;o if the Foreign Indians &s;hould come to &s;teal your Goods, or to kill; for you to be left to your Freedom to watch in your own Way, and to di&s;cover to the Magi&s;trate &s;uch as would de&s;troy your Lives or Plantations, or &s;teal, let them come from at home, or come from abroad, &s;uch evil Doers the Magi&s;trate is to puni&s;h, who is for the Prai&s;e of them that do well; &s;o that you may live and lead a godly and peaceable Life under them: And you that are Righteous, your watching, di&s;covering and declearing again&s;t &s;uch evil Doers, and Things, you clear your&s;elves, and demon&s;trate that your Te&s;timony is again&s;t &s;uch Things; and if the Magi&s;trates &s;hould be evily inclined, and God &s;hould bring the evil Doers as a Rod upon them, yet you are clear in your Te&s;timony, that knows Truth, and are in your Duty, and in your Obedience; and for this Cau&s;e he has his Tribute, and his Cu&s;tom, and his Due, and double Honour, if he rules well; and God has his Prai&s;e and his Honour, and in that Power and Truth of God, which is again&s;t Untruth and the Power of Darkne&s;s; and in the Light which is again&s;t Evil, and in the Life which is again&s;t Death; you di&s;cover the bad to him, for him to puni&s;h them upon true Evidence, and if he does not do it, it will lye upon him. And if he be a Prai&s;e to the Evil, and a di&s;couragement to the Good, then the Lord will deal with him; and tho' to &s;uch for Con&s;ci|ence and for the Lord's Sake, we cannot be &s;ubject to the evil, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ather &s;uffer thereby, and are &s;ubject to that which puni&s;hes

<P>Now, before we go further, we think proper to give &s;ome Ac|count of our Principles and Practices, concerning tho&s;e mutual Relations or Ranks of Men. "And fir&s;t of Kings, Rulers and Magi&s;trates; as it is our Belief that the Powers and Government we live under are of the Lord; &s;o we acknowledge, that Fidelity and Subjection is due to tho&s;e who are in Authority over us, expecting only the Benefit of tho&s;e good La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which are deem'd our Birthright, as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects, and not the Protection by Gun and Sword, which others makes the Terms of their Allegiance; and we faithfully own, that Magi&s;tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y is an Ordinace of God, and tho&s;e who rule well are worthy of double Honour, and de|&s;erve to be really valued and much e&s;teemed, not by giving them vain Appellations or &s;lattering Titles, nor by bowing the Body, or uncovering the Head, nor by feigned Words called Compli|ments;

but by obeying their ju&s;t and lawful Commands, wherein the true Honour and Subjection due to them doth chiefly con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>And it has been and is our frequent concern, according to pure Leadings and Dictates of God's holy Spirit, in our neare&s;t Ap|proaches to the Throne of his Grace, to make Supplication, Pray|er, Interce&s;&s;ion, and giving of Thanks for Kings, and all that are in Authority. And we have not been wanting in our re&s;pec|tive Places and Stations, to put People in Mind, as the Apo&s;tle exhorted, to be &s;ubjected to Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ipalities and Powers, to obey Magi&s;trates, and to &s;ubmit to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's Sake; whether it be to the King as Supreme, or unto Go|vernors as unto them that are &s;ent by him for the Puni&s;hment of evil Doers, and the Prai&s;e of them that do well; for &s;o the Magi&s;trates are Mini&s;ters of God to us for good, bearing not the Sword in Vain, being Revengers to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil; and for this Cau&s;e pay we Tribute al&s;o, for they are God's Mini&s;ters, attending continually on this very Thing. Yet when Laws and Statutes were made, requiring certain Conformi|ties, which for Con&s;cience Sake could not be complied with, by our faithful Friends; &s;ome Magi&s;trates, in&s;tead of the Sword of Ju&s;tice, took up the Sword of Per&s;ecution again&s;t them; Never|thele&s;s they did not re&s;i&s;t, but patiently &s;uffered the &s;poiling of their Goods, grievous Impri&s;onments, Scourging and Bani&s;hment from their tender Families, Friends and Relations, chu&s;ing, as the holy Apo&s;tles did in the like Ca&s;e, to obey God rather than Men. For they could not but &s;peak the Things which they had &s;een and heard; and for all this cruel U&s;age and Sufferings, they paid their Taxes and Tributes, rendering to Cae&s;ar the Things which were his, and to God the Things that were his; for &s;o was the Will of God, that with well-doing, they &s;hould put to Silence the Ig|norance of fooli&s;h Men.</P>

<HEAD>An Ob&s;ervation that a wi&s;e Author <HI>(William Penn)</HI> made on the Frame of Government.</HEAD>
<P>HE <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aith, "When the wi&s;e and great God had made the World, of all his Creatures, it plea&s;ed him to chu&s;e Man his Depu|ty to rule it; and to fit him for &s;o great a Charge and Tru&s;t, he did not only qualify him with Skill and Power, but with Integrity to to u&s;e them ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y. This native Goodne&s;s was equally his Honour and his Happine&s;s. And whil&s;t he &s;tood here, all went well; there was no Need of coercive or cumpul&s;ive Means; the Precept of di|vine Love and Truth, in his Bo&s;om, was the Guide and Keeper of his I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ocency: But Lu&s;t prevailing again&s;t Duty, made a lament|able Breach upon it; and the Law, that had before no Power o|ver him, took Place upon him and his di&s;obedient Po&s;terity, that &s;uch as would not live conformable to the holy Law within, &s;hould fall under the Reproof and Correction of the ju&s;t Law without, in a judicial Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="010583_0019_0F80F1DAF42048B8">
This the Apo&s;tle teaches in divers of his Epi&s;tles: The Law, &s;ays he, was added becau&s;e of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. In another Place, Knowing that the Law was not made for the Righteous Man, but for the Di&s;obedient and Ungodly, for Sinners, for Unholy and Pro|fane, for Murderers, for Whoremongers, for them that defile them&s;elves with Mankind, and for Men-&s;tealers, for Liars, for per|jured Per&s;ons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But this is not all, he opens and carries the Matter of Government a little further;&mdash;let every Soul be &s;ub|ject to the higher Powers; for there is no Power but of God. The Powers that be, are ordained of God: Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;t|eth the Power re&s;i&s;teth the Ordinance of God; for Rulers are not a Terror to good Works but to Evil: Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? Do that which is good and thou &s;halt have Prai&s;e of the &s;ame; he is the Mini&s;ter of God to thee for Good:&mdash;Wherefore ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for Wrath, but for Con&s;cience Sake.</P>
<P>This &s;ettles the divine Right of Government beyond Exception, and that for two Ends: Fir&s;t, to terrify evil Doers. Secondly, to cherri&s;h tho&s;e that do well; which gives Government a Life be|yond Corruption, and makes it as durable in the World as good Men &s;hall be; &s;o that Government &s;eems a Part of Religion it&s;elf, a Thing &s;acred in its In&s;titution and End: For if it does not di|rectly remove the Cau&s;e, it cru&s;hes the Effects of Evil, and is as &s;uch (though a lower yet) an Emanation of the &s;ame divine Power, that is both Author and Object of pure Religion; the Difference lying here, that the one is more free and mental, the other more corporeal and compul&s;ive in its Operations; but that is only to evil Doers, Government it&s;elf being otherwi&s;e as capable of Kind|ne&s;s, Goodne&s;s and Charity, as a more private Society. They weakly err, that think there is no other U&s;e of Government than Correction, which is the coar&s;e&s;t Part of it. Daily Experience tells us, that the Care and Regulation of many other Affairs, more &s;oft and daily nece&s;&s;ary, make up much the greate&s;t Part of Go|vernment; and which mu&s;t have followed the peopling of the World, had <HI>Adam</HI> never fell, and will continue among&s;t Men on Earth, under the highe&s;t Attainments they may arrive at, by the the Coming of the ble&s;&s;ed Second <HI>Adam,</HI> the Lord from Heaven. Thus much of Government in general, as to its Ri&s;e and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd. For particular Frames and Models, it will become me to &s;ay little; and comparatively I will &s;ay nothing. My Rea&s;ons are, Fir&s;t, that the Age is too nice and difficult for it, there being nothing the Wits of Men are more bu&s;y and divided upon. 'Tis true, they &s;eem to agree in the End, <HI>to wit,</HI> Happine&s;s; but in the Means they dif|fer, as to divine, &s;o to this human Felicity; and the Cau&s;e is much the &s;ame, not always want of Light and Knowledge, but want of u&s;ing them rightly. Men &s;ide with their Pa&s;&s;ions again&s;t their Rea|&s;on, and their &s;ini&s;ter Intere&s;ts have &s;o &s;trong a Bia&s;s upon their Minds, that they lean to them again&s;t the Good of the Things they
<PB N="20" REF="010583_0020_0F80F1DB89276DF8">
know. Secondly, I do not find a Model in the World, that Time, Place, and &s;ome &s;ingular Emergencies have not nece&s;&s;arily altered; nor is it ea&s;y to frame a civil Government that &s;hall &s;erve all Places alike. Thirdly. I know what is &s;aid by the &s;everal Admirers of Monarchy, Ari&s;tocracy and Democracy, which are the Rule of one, a few, and many, and are three common Ideas of Govern|ment, when Men di&s;cour&s;e on that Subject. But I chu&s;e to &s;olve the Controver&s;y with this &s;mall Di&s;tinction, and it belongs to all three. Any Government is free to the People under it (whatever be the Frame) where the Laws Rule, and the People are a Party to tho&s;e Laws; and more than that is Tyranns, Oligarchy, or Confu|&s;ion. But, la&s;tly, When all is &s;aid, there is ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lly one Frame of Government in the World &s;o ill de&s;igned by its fir&s;t Founders, that in good Hands would not do well enough; and Story tells us, the be&s;t in ill Ones can do nothing that is great or good: Witne&s;s the Jewi&s;h and Roman States. Governments, like Clocks, go from the Motion Men give them; and as Governments are made and moved by Men, &s;o by them they are ruined too; wherefore Governments rather depend upon Men, than Men upon Govern|ments. Let Men be good, and the Govern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent can't be bad; if it be ill, they will cure it: But if Men be bad, let the Govern|ment be never &s;o good, they will endeavour to warp and &s;poil it to their Turn. I know &s;ome &s;ay, Let us have good Laws, and no Matter for the Men that execute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m: But let them con&s;ider, that tho' good Laws do well, good Men do better; for good Laws may want good Men, but good Men will never want good Laws, nor &s;uffer ill Ones. 'Tis true, good Laws have &s;ome Awe upon ill Mi|ni&s;ters, but that is where they have no Power to e&s;cape or aboli&s;h them, and the People are generally wi&s;e and good; but a loo&s;e and depraved People (which is to the Que&s;tion) love Laws and an Admini&s;tration like them&s;elves. That, therefore, which makes a good Con&s;titution, mu&s;t keep it, <HI>viz.</HI> Men of Wi&s;dom and Vir|tue; Qualities that, becau&s;e they de&s;cend not with worldly Inhe|ritances, mu&s;t be carefully propagated by a virtuous Education of Youth, for which, after Ages will owe more to the Care and Pru|dence of Founders, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Magi&s;tracy, than to their Pa|rents for private Patrimonies.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations of the Weight of Government, and the nice and various Opinions about it, made it unea&s;y to me to pub|li&s;h the en&s;uing Frame, and conditional Laws, fore&s;eeing both the Cen&s;ures they will meet with from Men of differing Humours and Engagements, and the Occa&s;ion they may give of Di&s;cour&s;e be|yond my De&s;ign. But next to the Power of Nece&s;&s;ity (which is a Solicitor that will take no Denial) this induced me to a Compliance, that we have (with Reverence to God, and good Con&s;cience to Men) to the be&s;t of our Skill, contrived and compo&s;ed the Frame and Laws of this Government, to the great End of all Govern|ment, <HI>viz.</HI> To &s;upport Power in Reverence with the People, and

<P>And I think the Author to the u&s;eful Mi&s;cellanies, hath the&s;e Words (in Page 25.) It is the undoubted Prerogative of Princes to Command, and the Duty of Subjects to obey.

(An|&s;wered) We are &s;ubject, and for that Cau&s;e we do pay Taxes, Tribute and Cu&s;tom, and give unto Cae&s;ar the Things that are his, and unto God the Things that are his, <HI>to wit,</HI> Wor&s;hip <HI>&amp;c."</HI></P>
<P>To which may be added two or three Pa&s;&s;ages out of <HI>Ar&s;cotts</HI> Works, Page 251, and 52. "And in Regard we have been favour|ed by the Government, with the Enjoyment of our religious Li|berties in common, with other Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, and in an e&s;|pecial Manner relieved, by the Legi&s;lator in &s;everal Ca&s;es, which peculiarly concerns us as a People, We therefore think our&s;elves obliged earne&s;tly to advi&s;e all Friends, that they be particularly careful to behave with all Dutifulne&s;s and Gratitude, and e&s;pecially to di&s;countenance every the lea&s;t Appearance of indecent Freedom, or Mark of Di&s;&s;atisfaction in Word or Writing, relating to the Go|vernment".</P>
<P>And in the Epi&s;tle for 1732, is the following Clau&s;e, "It is acceptable to us to find by the Accounts from the &s;everal Parts of the Kingdom, that (according to former Exhortation of the Meeting) Friends continue generally careful not to defraud the King of his Cu&s;toms, Duties or Exerci&s;es; and &s;o far to di&s;|courage &s;uch Practices, as to avoid dealing in Goods, rea&s;onably &s;u&s;pected to be run.

<P>Al&s;o in the yearly Meeting Epi&s;tle for 1733, the Duty is again recommended in the&s;e Words, "The good Account we have received of Friends Care in general, to keep them&s;elves clear of defrauding the King, in any of his Cu&s;toms, Duties and Exci&s;e, are very acceptable to us, and we do, as formerly, &s;o now again, recommend the Continuance of a Duty &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and incum|bent on every good and faithful Subject, being expre&s;ly Com|manded by Chri&s;t him&s;elf; Render therefore unto Cae&s;ar the Things which are Cae&s;ar's, <HI>Matthew</HI> xxii <HI>Chap. 21 Ver&s;e."</HI></P>

<P>This is a Principle neither unrea&s;onable nor &s;editious, unle&s;s the prefering Chri&s;t's Precepts to Men's Injunctions can merit tho&s;e Epithets."

<P>"Since God hath a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf the Power and Dominion of the Con&s;cience, who alone can rightly in&s;truct and govern it; therefore it is not lawful for any who&s;oever, by Virtue of any Au|thority or Principality they bear in the Government of this World, to force the Con&s;cience<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of others; and therefore all killing, ba|ni&s;hing, fining, impri&s;oning and other &s;uch Things, which are inflicted upon Men for the alone Exerci&s;e of their Con&s;cience, or difference in Wor&s;hip or Opinion, proceedeth from the Spirit of <HI>Cain,</HI> the Murderer, and is contrary to the Truth; providing al|ways, that no Man under the Pretence of Con&s;cience, Prejudice his Neighbour in his Life or E&s;tate, or do any Thing de&s;tructive, or incon&s;i&s;tent with human Society; in which Ca&s;e the Law is for the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, and Ju&s;tice is to be admini&s;tred upon all, without Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons."

<HEAD>The Authority and Government which Chri&s;t excluded out of his Church, <HI>&amp;c. Matt xx.</HI> Ver&s;e 25 to the 29th.</HEAD>
<P>BUT Je&s;us called them unto him and &s;aid, Ye know that the Princes of the Gentiles exerci&s;e Dominion over them, and they that are great exerci&s;e Authority upon them; but it &s;hall not be &s;o among you: But who&s;oever will be great among you, let him be your Mini&s;ter. And who&s;oever will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> chief among you, let him be your Servant. Even as the Son of Man came not to be mini&s;tred unto, but to mini&s;ter, and to give his Life a Ran&s;om for many.</P>
<P>Here Chri&s;t cuts off that Power and Authority which grows up in the corrupt Nature of Man, which was ever and anon &s;pringing up even in the Di&s;ciples. Here he wholly excludes it out of his Church, and &s;ays, expre&s;ly, he would have no &s;uch Thing among them; no &s;uch Kind of Greatne&s;s, nor no &s;uch Kind of Authori|ty. Among the Gentiles there are great Ones, there are Princes; and the&s;e great Ones, the&s;e Princes, they lord it over the inferior Ones, exerci&s;ing Authority and Dominion over them; but it &s;hall not be &s;o among you.</P>
<P>The Gentile State was a Shadow, even as the <HI>Jews</HI> State was a Shadow, the one of Death, the other of Life, the one of Dark|ne&s;s, the other Light; the one was the Image of Satan, the Prince of Wickedne&s;s, the other of Chri&s;t, the Prince of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace; they were both Vails, under which the two Kingdoms were hid.</P>
<P>Now in this Gentile State there were Nations, Princes, Laws, Governments, Dominions, Authorities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But all in the Pa&s;t, all in the Darkne&s;s, all in the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion from the Life, the whole State was corrupt, and there mu&s;t be no Imitation from hence, no Likene&s;s of any &s;uch Thing in the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, no &s;uch Kind of Law, no &s;uch Kind of Government, no &s;uch Kind of Authority, no &s;uch Kind of Anger with Per&s;ons that Tran&s;gre&s;s, no &s;uch Kind of Dealing with any, no &s;uch Kind of Detriment or Hurt to any Thieves, nothing to hurt in the Mountains of God's Holine&s;s; but there is a righteous Scepter, a &s;weet Scepter, a &s;piritual Scepter, which Preacheth the Spirit in the Power of Life, but toucheth not the outward Man.</P>
<P>Two Things are here excluded by Chri&s;t, from whence all the Mi&s;chief ari&s;eth in the Church (all the Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;i|on of Men's Con&s;ciences, and of their Per&s;ons, E&s;tates and Li|berties for Con&s;cience Sake) fir&s;t, Greatne&s;s; &s;econdly, the Exer|ci&s;ing Dominion and Authority by tho&s;e that would be Great therein.</P>
<P>Such a Kind of Greatne&s;s as is in the World, its the De&s;truc|tion of the Life of Chri&s;t, and &s;uch a Kind of Dominion and Au|thority as is among the Nations, is the direct Overturning of the Kingdom of Chri&s;t: It &s;ets up another Power than Chri&s;t's, ano|ther Grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s than Chri&s;t's, another Kind of Authority than

Chri&s;t's, and &s;o it eats out the Virtue and Life of his Kingdom, and makes it ju&s;t like one of the Kingdoms of this World. It &s;hall not be &s;o among you. This Spirit mu&s;t be kept out from among you: This a&s;piring Spirit, this lofty ruling Spirit, which loves to be great, which loves to have Dominion, which would exalt it&s;elf, becau&s;e of the Gifts it hath received, and would bring others into Subjection, this Spirit mu&s;t be &s;ubdued among&s;t Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciples, or it will ruin all. The Lord gives Grace and Know|ledge for another End than for Men to take upon them to be great, and rule over other becau&s;e of it. And he that, becau&s;e of this, thinks him&s;elf fit to rule over other Men's Con&s;ciences, and to make them bow to what he knows or takes to be Truth; he lo&s;eth his own Life hereby, and &s;o far as he prevails upon others, he doth but de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y their Life too; for it is not &s;o much &s;peaking true Things that doth good, as &s;peaking them from the Pure, and convey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">em to the Pure; for the Life runs along from the Ve&s;&s;el of Life in one, into the Ve&s;&s;el of Life in another; and the Words (though never &s;o true) cannot convey Life to another, but as the Living Ve&s;&s;el opens in the one, and is opened in the other.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> But how &s;hall this Spirit be kept out, or kept down, that it may not hurt the Di&s;ciple in whom it ari&s;eth, or if it do, that the Hurt may remain to him&s;elf, and may not prejudice the Church? <HI>An&s;wer.</HI> When this Spirit begins to ari&s;e up in any, &s;o &s;oon as ever he perceives it in that, that di&s;covers it, he is to fight again&s;t it: Laying him&s;elf &s;o much the lower, by how much he finds this evil Spirit rai&s;ing him up; he is to hearken to that wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> pre&s;ents the Cro&s;s to it, and &s;o to come down and &s;ubject him&s;elf in &s;erving and mini&s;tering to tho&s;e who are little in his Eyes, in&s;tead of reinging over them: Let him lie beneath them; let him watch and know the Life even in the meane&s;t, and &s;erve it, for that is his Place. That which would Rule is to &s;erve, that which would be great is to be little, and the little One is to be|come a Nation; that which is low is to ri&s;e, and thou art not fit to ri&s;e with it, further than thou can&s;t &s;erve it, both in thy&s;elf and others. Therefore if ever thou be'&s;t a&s;piring, if ever thou have amind to rule, if ever thou think thy&s;elf fit to teach, becau&s;e of what thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ha&s;t received; &s;ink down, lie low, take up the Cro&s;s to that proud Spirit, make it bend and &s;erve, let the Life in every one ri&s;e over it, and trample upon it; and afterwards, that in thee may ari&s;e, which is fit to teach, yea, and to rule in the Lord, and &s;o long as that hath the Dominion, thou maye&s;t be &s;erviceable to the Lord, and to his Truth and People; but if ever the other get up again, thou mu&s;t pre&s;ently come down again, or the wrong Spirit will get Dominion over thee, which with force and cruelty will rule over the Life, both in thy&s;elf and others. Thus, if a Man be faithful to Chri&s;t, this evil a&s;piring Spirit, at its fir&s;t Appear|ance may be dealt with, and kept down; but if it be cheri&s;hed, given way to, and once let up, it will be hard bringing of it down afterwards; therefore the Di&s;ciples, or the Church of Chri&s;t,
<PB N="26" REF="010583_0026_0F80F1E0070B8B08">
they are to watch over every &s;uch Spirit, to beat it down, to te&s;ti|fy again&s;t it, to turn from it, to lay it flat, to put it in its proper Place, that is beneath all, to mini&s;ter to all, and &s;o not &s;uffer it to ri&s;e; &s;ee Ver&s;e 26th, Let him be your Mini&s;ter: This is his Place, this is his Work, by the Authority of Chri&s;t; he that would be great, he that would rule, let him mini&s;ter; own him there if he will lie low there, if he will be faithful there, ye may have Uni|ty with him; but in that his a&s;piring Temper, in his ruling, in his teaching by what he hath gained, or what hath been given to him formerly (if out of the pre&s;ent Life) he is to be denied and turned from.</P>
<P>If this Rule of Chri&s;t had been kept to, Antichri&s;tian Power could never have got up, nor the poor innocent Lambs &s;o often have been worried by the Wolves.

<P>Chri&s;t urgeth this upon his Di&s;ciples from his own Pattern, Even as the Son of Man came not to be mini&s;tred unto, but &amp;c. Ver&s;e 28th. If any had right to be great, &s;urely Chri&s;t; if any had right to exerci&s;e Authority, &s;urely Chri&s;t; if any was to be advanc|ed becau&s;e of any Gift received, or becau&s;e of any Pre&s;ence of the Spirit with him, &s;urely Chri&s;t. Yet Chri&s;t took not upon him this Kind of Greatne&s;s, nor did exerci&s;e this Kind of Authority, but he was a Servant, he made u&s;e of the Gift of the Spirit, of the Power of Life wherewith the Father filled him, to mini&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and &s;erve with; he did never lord it over the Con&s;ciences of any of his Di&s;ciples, but did bear with them, and pity them in their In|firmities: (What can ye not watch with me one Hour? The Spirit (&s;aid he) is willing, but the Fle&s;h is weak.) He did not hold forth to them whatever he knew to be Truth, requiring them to believe it, but was content with them in their State, and waited till their Capacities were enlarged, being &s;till &s;atisfied with the Hone&s;ty and Integrity of their Hearts in their pre&s;ent State of Weakne&s;s. Nor did he &s;trive to reign over the World, or call for Fire from Heaven, when they would not receive him or expre&s;s Indignation when they de&s;ired him to depart out of their Coa&s;ts; or pray for twelve Legions of Angels when they came to betray him, and mo&s;t unrighteou&s;ly &s;ought his Life; but the Life he had received of his Father, he gave up as a Ran&s;om for his Di&s;ciples, yea, and for his Enemies. Mark, he did not make u&s;e of what was given to him, to rai&s;e him&s;elf up above others, to make his Word to &s;tand for a Law, and be received, but he waited till that was opened in his Di&s;ciples, and in People which was able to receive his Te&s;timony; and he made u&s;e of his Power of Life, and the Fulne&s;s of the Spirit, to enable him the more abundantly to &s;erve and to wait in Patience, for the fulfiling of the Will of the Father.

<P>The Spirit of the Prophets is &s;ubject to the Prophets.</P>
<P>Here is the Government, here is the Law of Rule and Subjec|tion in the Life: Every one feeling a mea&s;ure of the Spirit in him&s;elf, is thereby taught to own and &s;ubject to a greater Mea&s;ure of the &s;ame Spirit in another. He that hath no Mea&s;ure of the Spirit of God, he is not of God, he is none of Chri&s;t's; and he that hath received a Mea&s;ure of the Spirit, in the &s;ame Spirit, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eleth another's Mea&s;ure, and owneth it in its Place and Service, and knoweth its moving, and cannot quench it, but giveth way to it with Joy and Delight.

<P>The Apo&s;tles and Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, come from Chri&s;t with a Me&s;&s;age of Life and Salvation, with a Te&s;timony concerning the good Will of God, and his Love to Mankind, pointing out the Way from Death to Life, from Bondage to Liberty, from W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th and De&s;truction, to Peace and Salvation.

<P>Now, that which they Preach to, is Men's Con&s;ciences in the Sight of God. They open the Truth which they know, they give their Te&s;timony in the moving, leading and Power of the Spirit, and they leave it to the &s;ame Spirit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o demon&s;trate it to Men's Con&s;ciences, as it plea&s;eth. They are nothing, they can do nothing, they cannot convert any Man to God; but the Power that &s;peaketh by them, the &s;ame Power worketh in other Men's Con&s;ciences, at its Plea&s;ure. And here is the Beginning of the Government of Chri&s;t in the Heart, when his Truth carries Con|viction with it to the Con&s;cience, and the Con&s;cience is drawn to yield it&s;elf up to him; then he lays his Yoke upon it, and takes upon him the guiding of it; he cheri&s;heth it, he clean&s;eth it, he comforteth it, he ordereth it at his Plea&s;ure, and he alone pre&s;erv|eth it pure, cha&s;te, gentle, meek and pliable to the Impre&s;&s;ions of his Spirit; and as the Con&s;cience is kept &s;ingle and tender to Chri&s;t, &s;o his Government increa&s;es therein; but as it becomes

hard, or &s;ubject to Men's Wills, &s;o another Spirit gets Domini|on over it.</P>
<P>Thererefore the great Work of the Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, is to keep the Con&s;cience open to Chri&s;t, and to pre&s;erve Men from receiving any Truths of Chri&s;t's, as from them, further than the Spirit opens, or to imitate any of their Practices, further than the Spirit leads, guides and per&s;uades them. For Per&s;ons are exceeding prone to receive Things as Truths from tho&s;e whom they have an high Opinion of, and to imitate their Practices, and &s;o hurt their own Growth, and endanger their Souls. For if I receive a Truth before the Lord makes it Manife&s;t to me, I lo&s;e my Guide, and follow but the Cour&s;e of the Fle&s;h, which is ex|ceeding greedy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eving Truths, and running into religious Practices without the Spirit; therefore the main Thing in Religi|on is, to keep the Con&s;cience pure to the Lord, to know the Guide, to follow the Guide, to receive from him that Light whereby I am to walk, and not to take Things for Truths, becau&s;e others &s;ee them to be Truths, but to wait till the Spirit makes them Manife&s;t to me; nor to run into Wor&s;hips, Duties, Perform|ances or Practices, becau&s;e others are led thither, but to wait till the Spirit lead me thither. He that makes ha&s;te to be rich, even in Religion, running into Knowledge, and into Wor&s;hips and Per|formances before he feel a true and clear Guidance, &s;hall not be innocent, nor the Lord will not hold him guiltle&s;s, when he comes to vi&s;it for &s;piritual Adultery and Idolatry. The Apo&s;tles were exceeding tender in this Point, for though they certainly and in|fallibly knew what was to be believed, yet they were not Lords over Mens Faith, but waited till he who is Lord of the Faith, would open the Way into Men's Con&s;ciences. They did not take upon them to be able to turn the Key, to let in Truth and Con|viction into Mens Spirits (as Men in the&s;e Days have been too apt to undertake) but directed them to him who had the Key, there to wait for the Conviction and Illumination of their Minds, and &s;o to receive in as they found him give forth to them.</P>
<P>Let every Man, &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, be fully per&s;uaded in his own Mind. Take heed of receiving Things too &s;oon, take heed of running into Practices too &s;oon, take heed of doing what ye &s;ee others do, but wait for your own particular Guidance, and for a full Per&s;ua&s;ion from God what is his Will concerning you; though I know this to be a Truth, yet do not ye receive it, till God make it Manife&s;t to you; receive Truth from his Hand; &s;tay till he give it you. Indeed the main Matter in Religion, is to keep out the wrong Part, the forward Part, the ba&s;tardly Birth from running into Duties, catching of Op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, and laying hold of Promi&s;es; and to feel the Heir born of the Immortal Seed, to whom all belongs, and that the other Birth never afterwards get up above him, but be &s;ubdued and brought into Subjection.</P>

This was the Apo&s;tles Rule, for every one to perform &s;ingly to the Lord, what he did, and not for one to meddle with the Light or Con&s;cience of another (undervaluing his Brother, or judging him becau&s;e his Light and Practice differed from his, <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 10th of that 14th <HI>Chap.</HI>) but every one to keep clo&s;e to their own Mea&s;ure of Light, even to that Proportion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aith and Knowledge which God of his Mercy hath be&s;towed on them; and here is the true Unity in the Spirit, in the inward Life, and not in an outward uniformity; that was not nece&s;&s;ary in the Apo&s;tles Days, nor is it nece&s;&s;ary now: And that Eye which &s;o dotes upon it, overlooks the one Thing which is nece&s;&s;ary; Men keeping clo&s;e to God, the Lord will

lead them on fa&s;t enough, and give them Light fa&s;t enough, for he taketh Care of &s;uch, and knoweth what Light and what Practices are mo&s;t proper for them; but for Men to walk on fa&s;ter than the Lord holds forth his Light to them, this overturns them, rai&s;ing up a wrong Thing in them, and the true Birth hereby comes to &s;uffer, to &s;hrink, and be drawn back. And, O! how &s;weet and plea&s;ant is it to the truly &s;pinitual Eye; to &s;ee &s;everal Sorts of Believers, &s;everal Forms of Chri&s;tians in the School of Chri&s;t, every one learning their own Le&s;&s;on, performing their own pecu|liar Service, and knowing, owning, and loving one another in their &s;everal Places, and different Performances to their Ma&s;ter, to whom they are to give an Account, and not to quarrel with one another about their different Practices, <HI>Romans</HI> xiv. 4. For this is the true Ground of Love and Unity, not that &s;uch a Man walks and does ju&s;t as I do, but becau&s;e I feel the &s;ame Spirit and Life in him, and in that he walks in his Rank in his own Order, in his proper Way and Place of Subjection to that; and this is far more plea&s;ing to me, than if he walked ju&s;t in that Track wherein I walk: Nay, &s;o far as I am &s;piritual, I cannot &s;o much as de&s;ire tnat he &s;hould do &s;o, until he be particularly led thereto, by the &s;ame Spirit which led me. And he that knows what it is to receive any Truths from the Spirit, and to be led by the Spirit, and how prone the fle&s;hly Part is to make ha&s;te, and how dangerous that ha&s;te is, will not be forward to pre&s;s his Knowledge or Practices upon others, but rather wait patiently till the Lord fit them for the receiving thereof, for fear, le&s;t they &s;hould receive and Practi&s;e too &s;oon, even in that Part which can|not &s;erve the Lord. And this I can truly &s;ay, concerning my&s;elf, I never found my Spirit forward to draw any, either to any Thing I believed to be true, or to any Practice or Way of Wor&s;nip I ob&s;erved or walked in, but de&s;ired that the Power and Leadings of Life might go before them; and was afraid le&s;t Men &s;hould re|ceive Things from my Hand and not from the Lord's. Yea, and this I very well Remember, that when I walked in the Way of Independency (as it hath been commonly called) I had more Unity with, and more Love towards &s;uch as were &s;ingle hearted in other Ways and Practices of Wor&s;hip (who&s;e Spirits I had &s;ome feeling of in the true Simplicity, and in the Life) than with divers of &s;uch, who were very knowing and zealous in that Way of Independency, in whom a wrong Thing in the mean time had got up, which had cau&s;ed them to &s;werve from the Life and from the Simplicity.</P>
<P>So that the true Church Government being in the Spirit, and over the Con&s;cience, as in the Sight of God, the great Care mu&s;t be to keep it within its Bounds, that nothing el&s;e govern but the Spirit, and that the Government be extended only unto that which is to be governed.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="010583_0032_0F80F1E61FCCF9D8">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Care mu&s;t be had that nothing govern in the Church of Chri&s;t but the Spirit of Chri&s;t; that nothing el&s;e teach, nothing el&s;e exhort, nothing el&s;e admoni&s;h and reprove, nothing el&s;e cut off and ca&s;t out. Every Mini&s;ter in the Church is to watch over his own Spirit, that it intrude not into the Work of God, that it take not upon it to be the Teacher, Exhorter, the Reprover, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And every Member is to wait in that Mea&s;ure of the Spirit which he hath received, to feel the goings &s;orth of the Spirit, in him who teacheth and governeth, and &s;o to &s;ubject, not to Man, but to the Lord, to receive from the Lord, to obey the Lord. Not to know any Mini&s;ter, according to the Fle&s;h, but to receive and &s;ubmit to what comes from the Spirit, in the Spirit. Not to know <HI>Paul</HI> or <HI>Apollo,</HI> or <HI>Cephas,</HI> but the Spirit mini&s;tering in them. <HI>Paul</HI> may err; <HI>Apollo</HI> may err; <HI>Peter</HI> may err (And did err, where he compelled the <HI>Gentiles</HI> to live as the <HI>Jews, Gal.</HI> ii. 14. For which <HI>Paul</HI> with&s;tood him to the Face, <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 11.) And <HI>Barnabas</HI> al&s;o did err, <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 13. But the Spirit cannot err: And he that keeps to the Mea&s;ure of the Spirit in him&s;elf, cannot let in any of thoir Errors, if they &s;hould err, but is pre&s;erved. For the lea&s;t Mea&s;ure of the Spirit is true, and gives true Judgment: But he that receiveth never &s;o great a Mea&s;ure of the Spirit, yet if he keep not low therein, but lifteth up him&s;elf becau&s;e there|of above his Brethren, may ea&s;ily err him&s;elf, and draw a&s;ide others into his Error.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Care mu&s;t be had that the Con&s;cience be kept tender, that nothing be received but according to the Light in the Con|&s;cience. The Con&s;cience is the Seat of Faith, and if it be not kept clo&s;e to the Light which God lighteth there, Faith is &s;oon made Shipwreck of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Chri&s;tianity is begun in the Spirit, which keepeth out the flle&s;hly Part, with all its fle&s;hly Wi&s;dom and Rea|&s;onings about &s;piritual Things: And as the Beginning is in the anointing, &s;o mu&s;t the Progre&s;s be; as the Spirit begins in the Con&s;cience by convincing that, by per&s;uading that, by &s;etting up his Light there, and leading the Soul by that Light; &s;o that Light mu&s;t &s;till be eyed, and acording to its Growth and Manife&s;tation in the Con&s;cience, &s;o mu&s;t the Soul &s;tand &s;till, or go on.</P>
<P>The great Error of the Ages of the Apo&s;tacy hath been to &s;et up an outward Order and Uniformity, and to make Men's Con|&s;ciences bend thereto, either by Arguments of Wi&s;dom, or by force, but the Property of the true Church Government is, to leave the the Con&s;eience to its full Liberty in the Lord, to pre&s;erve it &s;in|gle and entire for the Lord to exerci&s;e, and to &s;eek Unity in the Light and in the Spirit, walking &s;weetly and harmoniou&s;ly to|gether in the mid&s;t of different Practices. Yea, and he that hath Faith, and can &s;ee beyond another, yet can have it to him&s;elf, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> his Brother with it, but can de&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d and walk with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> ording to his Mea&s;ure, and if his Brother have any heavy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> upon him, can lend him his Shoulder, and bear Part of

his Burthen with him. O! How &s;weet and lovely is it to &s;ee Brethren dwell together in Unity, to &s;ee the true Image of God rai&s;ed in Per&s;ons, and the knowing, and loving one another in the &s;ame Image, and bearing with one another through Love, and helping one another under their Temptations and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Spirit, which every one mu&s;t expect to meet with.</P>
<P>If thou art a Chri&s;tian in Deed, and in Truth, pre&s;erve thy Con&s;cience pure and tender towards God; do not defile it with &s;uch religious Practices, Duties, Ordinances, <HI>&amp;c.,</HI> as thou do&s;t not feel the Spirit leading thee into; for all &s;uch are Idols and exceed|ingly pollute thee. And be tender al&s;o of thy Brother's Con&s;ci|ence, and be not an In&s;trument to draw him unto any Thing which the Lord leads him not into, but rejoice if thou find him in Sim|plicity of Heart, &s;tartling at any Thing; for if he abide here faithful, his Guide will in due Sea&s;on appear to him, and clear up his Way before him; but if he be too ha&s;ty he may follow a wrong Guide, and that Guide will never lead him aright towards the Kingdom, but intangle him further and further from it.</P>
<P>O how many have run a Whoring from the Lord! How many have fir&s;t lo&s;t the Guidance of his Spirit, and then drowned their Life in religious Performances! How many have drunk of the Cup of Fornication from the Life; at the Hands of the fle&s;hly Wi&s;dom! How many have filled their Spirit with New-Te&s;tament Idols and Images! How many have even hardened their Hearts and Con&s;ciences, by following the Doctrines of Men, their imagi|nary Meanings of Scriptures, and the Imaginations and Dreams of their own Hearts! Is it not time for Men at length to turn back towards the Lord, to wait for the Vi&s;itation and Light of his Spirit, from whom they have gone a Whoring, and whom in all the&s;e Things they have grieved? And if ever any feel and enjoy the Guidance of God's Spirit, their Con&s;cience mu&s;t be ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ten|der to it, and ready to hear and follow his Voice, who &s;peaks in Spirit to that which is born of him, which infallibly knows his Voice, and being kept clear, cannot doubt concerning it. My Sheep hear my Voice, &s;aith Chri&s;t, they know it; and the Voice of the &s;trange Spirit they know not, &s;o as to follow it, but turn from it both in them&s;elves and others: But that which is not the Sheep, but hath only the Sheep's Cloathing, cries out, how &s;hall we know the Voice of the Spirit? We may be deceived. Nay, that which is born of God, that which is the Elect of God, can|not be deceived. Wait therefore for the Birth of the Spirit, to which the Spirit is given for a Guide, who infallibly guides it out of Deceit. All Deceivers are out of this Birth, out of this Spirit, perhaps in &s;ome Birth or other, framed from the letter, and living in the Imitation of &s;ome Practices and Ordinances from the letter (un|der which Cover they lie in wait to deceive) but Strangers to the Life and Power, and to that Wi&s;dom which begets and bears to God. Thus the <HI>Jews</HI> err'd, and deceived their <HI>Pro&s;elites</HI> before

the coming of Chri&s;t. Thus the Chri&s;tians (in Name) have ge|nerally erred all along the Apo&s;tacy, and indeed (for the Gene|rallity) have not been true Chri&s;tians, but only a per&s;ecuted Rem|nant among&s;t them, who&s;e Life hath been nouri&s;hed and pre&s;erv|ed, not by Doctrines and Ob&s;ervations which they have been taught by the Precepts of Men, nor by the Knowledge which they them|&s;elves have gathered; but by a little Bread daily handed to them from the Father of Mercies out of the Wilderne&s;s: That was the Thing which nouri&s;hed their Souls up to God, though many of them knew not di&s;tinctly what it was that nouri&s;hed them, nor how they came by it.</P>
<P><HI>Objection.</HI> But is not Uniformity lovely, and doth not the Apo&s;|tle exhort Chri&s;tians to be of one Mind, and were it not a &s;weet Thing if we were all of one Heart and one Way?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Yea, Uniformity is very lovely, and to be de&s;ired and waited for, as the Spirit of the Lord which is one, leads and draws into one. But for the fle&s;hly Part (the wi&s;e rea&s;oning Part of Man) by fle&s;hly Ways and Means to &s;trive to bring about fle&s;hly Uniformity which en&s;nares and overbears the tender Con&s;cience, this is not lovely, nor &s;piritual, nor Chri&s;tian like. And the Apo|&s;tle, who exhorts Chri&s;tians to one Mind, yet doth not bid them force one another into one Mind, but walk together &s;weetly &s;o far as they had attained, and wherein they were otherwi&s;e minded, God in his due Time would reveal more to them, <HI>Philip</HI> iii. 15, 16. He that hath, to him it &s;hall be given; and the Intent and Work of the Mini&s;try (with the &s;everal Mini&s;trations of it) is to bring into the Unity, <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> iv. 13. as Per&s;ons are able to follow, and not to force all Men into one Practice or Way; that's the Way to de&s;troy the Faith, and the true Unity, and at be&s;t can Intro|duce but a fle&s;hly Appearance of Unity in &s;uch a Form of Wor&s;hip and Godline&s;s, as eats out the Power. And for being of one Heart and one Way, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, this is in a Mea&s;ure known and witne&s;&s;ed; the Way is one Chri&s;t, the Truth of God; and he that is in the Faith, and in the Obedience to that Light which &s;hines from his Spirit into the Heart of every Believer, hath a ta&s;te of the one Heart, and of the one Way, and knoweth that no Variety of Practices (which is of God) can make a Breach in the true Unity. This is the one Way, for every one to be &s;ubject to that Light of Chri&s;t's Spirit which he hath received from Chri&s;t; and every one keeping here, there is al&s;o one Heart kept in the mid&s;t of all the Variety, and Diver&s;ity of Practices. And the Unity being thus kept, all will come into one outwardly; al&s;o at length, as the Light grows in every one, and as every one grows into the Light; but this mu&s;t be patiently waited for from the Hand of God (who Hath the right Way of effecting it, and who alone can do it) and not har&s;hly and cruelly attempted by the rough Hand of Man.</P>
