<HEAD><HI>JOHN ROGERS, A SERVANT of JESUS CHRIST.</HI> To any of the Flock of Chri&s;t that may be &s;cattered among the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> Greeting.</HEAD>
<P>I WISH you grace and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Ble&s;&s;ed be the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who hath called us with an holy calling, and hath revealed his everla&s;ting Love (in and through Je&s;us Chri&s;t his beloved Son) unto us by his own &s;pirit.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE, brethren, I be&s;eech you to walk worthy of this holy calling, not fa&s;hioning your&s;elves according to the former con|ver&s;ation in the time of your ignorance, when you were ignorant of the true God; but now being tran&s;lated out of a &s;tate of darkne&s;s into a &s;tate of light, now walk as children of light, bringing forth the fruits of God's &s;pirit, &s;eeing he hath &s;owed the &s;eed of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s in your hearts, be ye now the followers of them, who through faith and patience, come to inherit the promi&s;es which God hath made to them that love him; for though you may have a great and terrible wilderne&s;s to travel through before ye come to inherit that ble&s;&s;ed promi&s;e, yet, through faith and patience, you may be led through the great deep, and &s;ee your enemies drowned in the depth of the &s;ea, and you &s;tand and rejoice in the God of your &s;alvation; yet did tho&s;e afterward peri&s;h that believed not in their journey toward the land of re&s;t, but fell &s;hort of it.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;een and learned by experience, that it is a needful thing, that patience &s;hould have its perfect work, in the day of tempta|tion, and that without believing in God, in all trials, it is impo&s;|&s;ible that we can enjoy it, without being led by his &s;pirit; there|fore
<PB N="4" REF="015068_0003_0F95A23D1324B220">
it is written, <HI>as many as are led by the &s;pirit of God, are the &s;ons of God; and if we be the &s;ons of God, then are we heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chir&s;t, of that inheritance which our heavenly fa|ther hath promi&s;ed us, even that inheritance which is everla&s;ting;</HI> but take heed le&s;t there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God, and &s;o you come to fall &s;hort of that re&s;t; for there remains the keeping of an everla&s;ting &s;abbath of re&s;t, to the people of God.</P>
<P>BUT the people, after they were delivered out of Egypt, peri&s;h|ed in the wilderne&s;s, becau&s;e of their unbelief, and &s;o fell &s;hort of that re&s;t, which was a figure of the true, unto whom the go&s;pel was preached; but they not being united to it by faith, they peri&s;hed in the wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>BELOVED in the Lord, I am greatly &s;en&s;ible, though you are not, how that you are entangled in the evil net of antichri&s;t, and mi&s;erably bewildered in the traditions and delu&s;ions of a wicked and an adultrous generation, who have gone a whoring from God, and is become an harlot, and her teachers are &s;uch as have not en|tered into the &s;heepfold by the door, but have climbed up another way, that is, they are not &s;ent from God, but have their call and authority from an earthly power, according to what was before told us by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his holy apo|&s;tles, how that <HI>in the la&s;t days there &s;hould come fal&s;e, teachers, as there had been of old fal&s;e prophets;</HI> and how that they would deceive ma|ny by rea&s;on of which the way of truth &s;hould be evil &s;poken of; and how that many &s;hould follow their pernicious ways; therefore it is written, <HI>they &s;hall heap to them&s;elves teachers, having itching ears, and &s;hall t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rn away their ears from the truth, and &s;hall give heed unto fables:</HI> Now the truth which they &s;hall turn their ears from is Chri&s;t him&s;elf, although they confe&s;s him in words, yet deny him in works; for Je&s;us Chri&s;t is a quickning &s;pirit, and this &s;pirit is in all God's children, and is the truth according to Chri&s;t's words, <HI>I am the way, and the truth, and the life;</HI> he that is in this &s;pirit is in the truth, and he that is led by it is in the truth; and it is the life of Chri&s;t in you, and you need not that any man &s;hould teach you, for you are compleat in Chri&s;t, who is the head of all power and authority what&s;oever. I cannot &s;ay to you as once the apo&s;tle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to a church of Chri&s;t, <HI>beware le&s;t any man &s;poil you through phi|lo&s;ophy and vain deceit, after the traditions of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Chri&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e you are entangled already

in the evil net of antichri&s;t, in following after the traditions of men, and not being lead only by the &s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Chri&s;t; this is the very grounds of your walking in darkne&s;s, and not in the light of a&s;&s;urance; but I can &s;ay to you as he did to them in the very next words, <HI>for in him dwelleth all the fulne&s;s of the Godhead bodily, and ye are compleat in him, and you need not be taught but as that &s;pirit of truth teacheth you;</HI> and if ye be followers of it, it will lead you into all truth, even that &s;pirit whom the world cannot receive, becau&s;e the world doth not &s;ee it, nor know it, but ye know it, for it dwelleth in you, and it hath given you an under&s;tanding, to know him that is true; you that are of Chri&s;t's &s;heep, have heard his voice &s;peak|ing in you, in the voice of the &s;pirit of truth, which hath taken of his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and revealed it unto you; and if this &s;pirit abide in you, ye al&s;o &s;hall continue in the Father and in the Son; for to be led by the &s;pirit of truth, is the path of the ju&s;t, which will lead unto a perfect light, and by this means you will be able to try the &s;pirits of fal&s;e prophets, and al&s;o of the true; for many fal&s;e pro|phets are gone out into the world, which in words confe&s;s Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be their king, but &s;in rules in them; they will confe&s;s Chri&s;t to be their prie&s;t, but never yet was freed from the guilt of &s;in, through the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf; they will &s;ay he is their pro|phet, but never yet heard the voice of his &s;pirit &s;peaking in them; yet they will pray, preach, and make a great outward &s;how, when the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t is not in them. The&s;e are the antichri&s;ts and deceivers that we have had fore-warning of, that &s;hould come, that have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t in them; but &s;aith the apo&s;tle John, <HI>ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things: I have not written unto you becau&s;e ye know not the truth, but becau&s;e ye know it.</HI> This unction is the &s;pirit of truth, which all God's chrildren are annointed with; it is the immediate teaching of Chri&s;t, who dwells in his own children, as the &s;pirit of the wicked one dwells in his children; and it is the &s;pirits that we are exhorted to try, and not to believe every &s;pirit; for many fal&s;e prophets were gone out into the world in the days of the apo&s;tle John, but have now &s;pread over nations and kingdoms, who &s;et light for darkne&s;s, and dark|ne&s;s for light, who call evil good, and good evil: The&s;e are not called or &s;ent of God, neither hath Je&s;us Chri&s;t revealed him&s;elf to them; their call is only from an earthly power, and through co|vetou&s;ne&s;s; with feigned words, they make merchandize of you, and their preachings is only their own imaginations or &s;tudyings.</P>
<P>AND I have written unto you the way and manner of God's call|ing and &s;ending his me&s;&s;engers, in all ages, as the penmen of the

holy &s;cripture have left upon record, who&s;e writings are as a light that &s;hineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-&s;tar ari&s;e in your hearts; which will certainly be, if you order your con|ver&s;ation aright, and become fruitful branches in Chri&s;t the true vine; for the goings of the Lord towards his people (that are led &s;ingly by his &s;pirit) is like the morning light, which &s;hines more and more even unto the perfect day. And there is no writings of the holy prophets or apo&s;tles that is of any private interpretation; for the &s;criptures of truth came not in old time by the wi&s;dom or learning of the world, but holy men of God &s;pake as they were im|mediately enlightened by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t which was in them; and it is the &s;ame &s;pirit that gives us an under&s;tanding of their writings, according to what is written. Luke xxiv. 45. <HI>Then opened he their under&s;tanding, that they might under&s;tand the &s;criptures,</HI> 1 John v. 20, 21. <HI>And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an under&s;tanding that we may know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, even in his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t; this is the true God and eternal Life.

<P>HERE ari&s;eth a que&s;tion in the fir&s;t place, what this promi&s;e is? Which que&s;tion is re&s;olved in the 17th ver&s;e; which was the promi&s;e that God made by the prophet Joel, &s;aying, <HI>and it &s;hall come to pa&s;s in the la&s;t days (&s;aith God) I will pour out of my &s;pirit upon all fle&s;h; and your &s;ons and your daughters &s;hall prophecy.</HI> So that this promi&s;e is the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t. The &s;econd que&s;tion is, to whom is it promi&s;ed, and upon what conditions? An&s;wer, it was promi&s;ed to all that was there pre&s;ent, which were both Jew and Gentile, yea, of every nation under heaven, ver&s;e 5. And upon what condition is &s;hewed in the 38th ver&s;e? <HI>Then Peter &s;aid unto them, repent, and be bapti&s;ed, every one of you in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and ye &s;hall receive the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t. For the promi&s;e is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God &s;hall call:</HI> As much as if he &s;hould &s;ay, this promi&s;e is not made only to you that are here this day pre&s;ent, but to your children af|ter you, and to all that are afar off; for &s;o did God before promi&s;e,
<PB N="7" REF="015068_0006_0F95A230DF4B3330">
by the prophet Joel, not only to pour out his &s;pirit upon their &s;ons and daughters, but al&s;o upon all fle&s;h, that is, &s;o many as God &s;hall call, both far and near, they repenting, believing, and obey|ing; &s;o that this promi&s;e is made (both to father, &s;on and daughter, upon their repentance, and being bapti&s;ed in the name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t) that they &s;hall receive the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, and al&s;o to all afar off, not only to Jews, but al&s;o to Gentiles; as &s;aith Paul, Eph. ii. 17. <HI>And came and preached peace to you which were afar off,</HI> that is the Gentiles; <HI>and to them that were nigh,</HI> that was the Jews; for both Jew and Gentile have an entrance into God's love and favour, only by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and that through the blood of Je&s;us, who was that lamb of God that taketh away that &s;in of the world.</P>
<P>NOW the outward wa&s;hing with water by the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, is but an outward &s;ign to the world; and there is no virtue at all in it; for all divine virtue is only from the divine power, for every good gift, and every perfect gift, is from God; and that is not the bapti&s;m that is outward with the element of water, but that is the bapti&s;m that wa&s;heth the heart and inward parts, from the defile|ment of &s;in, James i. 17. Matt. iii. 11. 1 Cor. xii. 13. which is the work of God, done only in the name of his &s;on; and by a divine water, which is the water of life, and doth quicken the dead &s;inner, that repents and believes in the God that rai&s;ed up Je&s;us from the dead, he al&s;o is rai&s;ed up by the &s;ame &s;pirit with Chri&s;t. And this outward &s;ign, acted by the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, is a figure of this death, burial, and re&s;urrection with Chri&s;t, which is &s;een and felt by every one that is Chri&s;t's; for they have the im|mediate witne&s;s of God in them&s;elves, 1 John ii. 20. 1 John v. 10, 20. 2 Tim. iii. 5. But the antichri&s;tian world, that hath not this immediate in&s;piration of God, which is a holy unction, they idolize the outward &s;igns, and are enemies to godline&s;s, but know nothing of that mighty power that worketh in us; as it is written, Eph. iii. 20.

<P>THE fir&s;t thing that we are to take notice of is this, that this chapter is an an&s;wer to what this church wrote to Paul about, and is to re&s;olve their doubt about marriage; as ver&s;e 1, they be|ing &s;uch as had newly turned from dumb idols to the living God, and que&s;tioning whether it was lawful for the believer to have com|munion with the unbeliever, as man and wife; to which doubt Paul gives his judgment, as in the 12th ver&s;e, <HI>but to the re&s;t &s;peak I, not the Lord;</HI> for though he had not any immediate commandment from the Lord, yet he gives them his judgment, &s;aying, <HI>If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and &s;he be plea&s;ed to dwell with him, let him not put her away,</HI> ver. 13. <HI>And the woman which hath an hu&s;band that believeth not, and if he be plea&s;ed to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</HI> And the rea&s;on that he gives, why the believer &s;hould not put away the unbeliever, is this, <HI>that the unbeliever is &s;anctified to the believer;</HI> for it is evident, though the marriage was made in the belivers unconverted e&s;tate, yet to be kept by the believers; for <HI>marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled,</HI> Heb. xiii. 4. But the que&s;tion here ari&s;eth, only by the believer; now if the unbe|liver be not &s;anctified to the believer, then of nece&s;&s;ity the children mu&s;t be &s;o e&s;teemed al&s;o, as unclean, and not holy, to the beliver; as in <HI>Ezra</HI> x. 3. and &s;o both wives and children to be put away, not being &s;anctified, but unclean to the believer: For this &s;anctifi|cation and holine&s;s, that the unbeliver and belivers children is to the beliver, comes not in by the redemption of Chri&s;t, to which bapti&s;m is a figure of, but by the covenant of marriage, which <HI>is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled;</HI> for the children's holine&s;s comes as well from the unbeliever as from the believer; for if the unbeliever be not &s;anctified by, or to the believer, then the children are unclean to the believer al&s;o; for the&s;e children's cleanne&s;s to the believer, comes in by the unbelievers being &s;anctified to or by the believer; &s;o that both wife and children are clean to him, or hu&s;|band and children clean to her; but if the one be to be put away, then the other al&s;o; for if the one be not &s;anctified, then is the other unclean al&s;o, and not holy, and &s;o both to be &s;eparated from the believer, as not clean; &s;o that if the unbeliever be not fir&s;t &s;anc|tified to the believer, then are the children unclean al&s;o to the

the children of God by faith in Chri&s;t, upon which the covenant is founded; for the children of the fle&s;h, though <HI>Abraham's</HI> &s;eed, are not counted for the &s;eed, nor intended in the covenant; <HI>but it is the children of promi&s;e,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle. <HI>Now, we, brethren</HI> (&s;aith the apo&s;tle to the Gentiles) <HI>as I&s;aac was, are the children of promi&s;e;</HI> and <HI>Abraham</HI> is the father of all them that believe. So that the covenant as it is &s;piritual, and a go&s;pel covenant, it is made to <HI>Abraham</HI> and his &s;eed, counting them only to be <HI>Abraham's</HI> &s;eed, who are Chri&s;t's by adoption, and that through faith, and &s;o come into this covenant, Gal. iii. 16, 29. <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 15, 16, 17.

<P>NOW as the covenant was temporal, it contained only temporal promi&s;es, which had a temporal token annexed to it, which was the outward circumci&s;ion that was made in the fle&s;h; but to relate it in order as it was temporal, it was thus, God was a God to Abraham's fle&s;hly &s;eed, begotten by I&s;aac and Jacob, in that he brought them out of Egypt, and led them forty years in the wilder|ne&s;s, and gave them the earthly Canaan, read Gen. xv. begining at the 13th ver&s;e to the end, for there the covenant was fir&s;t made with Abraham.</P>
<P>BUT the go&s;pel covenant was preached to Abraham by the&s;e tem|poral things, as thus; God is a God to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and to his &s;eed, through faith in Chri&s;t, in delivering them out of the bondage of &s;in, and leading them &s;afely through the wilderne&s;s of of affliction, till he brings them to the everla&s;ting inheritance purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t, and there gives them re&s;t from all their enemies; which in|heritance is everla&s;ting, world without end. And the token of this covenant (as it is &s;piritual) is the circumci&s;ion of the heart, wrought by the &s;pirit of God, in cutting off our &s;ins, by the circumci&s;ion of Chri&s;t; and this circumci&s;ion of the heart is the &s;eal of this coven|ant, as it is a go&s;pel covenant; and therefore it is written, <HI>That is not circumci&s;ion that outward in the fle&s;h.</HI> And again, &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, Abraham <HI>received the &s;ign of circumci&s;ion,</HI> calling the out|ward circumci&s;ion, the &s;ign of circumci&s;ion, <HI>That he might be the father of all them that believe;</HI> &s;o that only them that believe by &s;cripture account, are reckoned for Abraham's &s;eed: And another &s;cripture &s;aith, <HI>After that ye belived, ye were &s;ealed with the holy &s;pirit of promi&s;e, which is the earne&s;t of our inheritance;</HI> Rom. ii. 29.

<HEAD><HI>Concerning</HI> BAPTISM.</HEAD>
<P>BAPTISM is an ordinance of the New Te&s;tament, and it is a vi&s;ible figure of the death, burial, and re&s;urrection of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, and of our death, burial, and re&s;urrection by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for the Lord Je&s;us did ordain, that the excellent virtues of his &s;ufferings &s;hould be held forth by outward figures, which have no virtue in them&s;elves, but are outward &s;igns of real bene|fits and virtue that we have received by Chri&s;t.

And can give as true a witne&s;s of the death of Chri&s;t as they that did behold his &s;ufferings with a mortal eye; and can &s;et to his &s;eal that the holy &s;criptures are true by an immediate in&s;piration of God, 1 John ii. 20, 21. For the &s;inner is now born again, and is become a &s;aint, and doth &s;ee by the eye of faith, that the body of &s;in, which he before carried about with him, is crucified with Chri&s;t, dead and buried with him; &s;o that the old man, or body of &s;in, is put off by the power and &s;pirit of God; &s;o that he &s;ees by the &s;pirit of faith which dwells in him, that he is put to death in the fle&s;h, as to &s;in, by the virtue of Chri&s;t's death, applied to him by the &s;pirit of God; and he hath not only a wit|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t's death, but al&s;o of his re&s;urrection; for by the re|&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, a re&s;urrection out of &s;in is brought to light, and al&s;o a re&s;urrection of the body; for what is lo&s;t by the fir&s;t Adam is recovered by the &s;econd; for upon repentance and faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t there is not only a death to &s;in, but the very &s;pirit that rai&s;ed up Je&s;us Chri&s;t from the dead hath quickened us al&s;o together with him, and rai&s;ed us up to a new life, 1 Pet. iv. 1, 2, 3.

And thus the &s;inner hath an entrance into the love of God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;tands and rejoices in hope of eter|nal life, &s;eeing he is born of God even by the &s;pirit of truth, by

<P>NOW this great work, which is the workman&s;hip of God, is in|vin&s;ible to the world, and therefore God hath ordained that it &s;hall be preached by an outward and a vi&s;ible figure, mini&s;tred by his me&s;&s;engers, in burying the repenting and believing &s;inner into the likene&s;s of Chri&s;t's death, and rai&s;ing him up in the likene&s;s of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection; &s;o that the death and re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t is figured out, and our death and re&s;urrection by Chri&s;t, in that ordinance; and this is the rea&s;on why we are buried with him in bapti&s;m, Rom. vi. 3, 4. <HI>Know ye not, that &s;o many of us as were baptized into Je&s;us Chri&s;t, were baptized into his death?

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS was a parable &s;poken by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t when he was upon the earth, but the hired &s;hepherds of I&s;rael that he put it forth to, under&s;tood it not, as in ver. 6, compared with ver. 12. Now a parable is to &s;et forth another thing, and hath always a meaning to it, as in Prov. i. 6. Now this parable of Chri&s;t hath an interpretation to it, which we are to &s;earch into. In the fir&s;t ver&s;e we read of a &s;heepfold, and a door to enter into the &s;heepfold, al&s;o, they <HI>that enter not into this &s;heepfold by the door, but climeth up &s;ome other way, the &s;ame is a thief and a robber.</HI> In the &s;econd ver&s;e we read, that he <HI>that entreth in by the door, is the &s;hepherd of the &s;heep.</HI></P>
<P>NOW the&s;e things rai&s;e que&s;tions, and an enquiry, what this &s;heepfold is? And what the flock is? And what the door is? And who the thief and robber is? And who the &s;hepherd is that enters in by the door?</P>
<P>TO which I an&s;wer: The &s;heep is Chri&s;t's flock, the fold is the place where they re&s;t, the door is Chri&s;t, as in ver&s;e 9; the thief and robber were tho&s;e &s;hepherds which the world hired, and not &s;ent by Chri&s;t, as in ver&s;e 12; and the &s;hepherd that enters in by the door, are tho&s;e &s;hepherds that go not into the fold till Chri&s;t &s;ends them; &s;o that they enter in by him, who is the good or chief &s;hepherd of his own flock, as ver&s;e 14.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ome may &s;ay, I de&s;ire to be farther informed in this mat|ter, how Chri&s;t calls and &s;ends his &s;hepherds, &s;o that it may be truly &s;aid, they enter into the &s;heepfold by the door, which is by him&s;elf? And al&s;o, how the thief and robber that climbe up &s;ome other way into the &s;heepfold, may be found out who he is, that &s;o the true &s;hepherds may be di&s;cerned from the fal&s;e, and that by &s;cripture te&s;timony?

<P>NOW we &s;hall come to de&s;cribe, by the &s;criptures of truth, which way the true &s;hepherds come into their mini&s;try; and then 2dly, how the thief and robber climbs up another way, which is the hireling. In ver&s;e 8 &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers;</HI> &s;o that here in this ver&s;e the thief and robber is &s;aid to be thieves and robbers, that is, the hirelings, or hired &s;hep|herds. Now to look with a carnal eye at Chri&s;t's words, where he &s;aith, <HI>all that ever came before me,</HI> it might be objected and replied to him, that Abraham, Mo&s;es, I&s;aiah, Jeremiah, and the like, were true &s;hepherds, and came into the &s;heepfold before thee, yet were no thieves nor robbers, but entered in by the door. Chri&s;t would have an&s;wered, they did not come before me, for before Abraham was, I am; and Abraham did not go before I called him, and &s;ent him, Gen. xii. 1, 4. I&s;a. xli. 2. And &s;o Mo&s;es did not go before, till I appeared to him in the bu&s;h, and called him, and &s;ent him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> people I&s;rael, to be their &s;hepherd. Yea, it may truly be &s;aid, that Chri&s;t was in them, and went with them, and that it was his voice which &s;pake; <HI>and that no man taketh this honour to him&s;elf but he that is called of God, as was Aaron,</HI> Heb. v. 4; if they do they are thieves and robbers, though men and devils or|dain them in their office, and teach them all the learning that the world can afford; to preach and to pray with all the excellent words they can &s;tudy, and that the devil can &s;ugge&s;t into them; yet if Chri&s;t have not called them, and &s;ent them, they do but de|ceive the world, and a devil is in them, that transforms him&s;elf as an angel of light. Now &s;uch &s;hepherds as the&s;e come not in by the door, but come in as a thief, only to kill and &s;teal, as in ver&s;e 10, not being called nor &s;ent by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is the door, but climb up another way. They come to cloath them&s;elves with the wool, and to kill them that Chri&s;t hath fed, according to what is written, Ezek. xxxiv. 2, 3, <HI>Wo be to the &s;hepherds of I&s;rael that do

feed them&s;elves. Ye eat the fat, and ye cloath you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed.</HI> The&s;e are the hirelings that have no faith in God, but, contrary to the &s;cripture, take thought what they &s;hall eat, and what they &s;hall drink, and how they &s;hall be cloathed, be|cau&s;e they have no ground of faith in him, not being called nor &s;ent by him, but climb up another way into the &s;heepfold.</P>
<P>NOW all the true &s;hepherds of Chri&s;t come in by the door, that is, by Chri&s;t; for they are called and &s;ent by him into the &s;heep|fold, and &s;o enter in by the door, not to kill nor &s;teal, but to feed the flock. They do not go before he comes to them, and calls them, and &s;ends them, and delivers to them the key of know|ledge; &s;o that they enter in by the door into the &s;heepfold, that is to &s;ay, by Chri&s;t him&s;elf. And being thus called and &s;ent by Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, having their authority from heaven as John the bapti&s;t had, and not from an earthly power, they come in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in oppo&s;ition to the world, and to tho&s;e hireling &s;hep|herds that have their authority only from men, and &s;o have entered into the &s;heepfold another way, and not by Chri&s;t, who is the door.</P>
<P>NOW con&s;ider the cloud of witne&s;&s;es that have left record in the holy &s;criptures, after what manner Chri&s;t called and &s;ent his &s;hepherds into the world to feed his flock, and to bear witne&s;s again&s;t the thieves and robbers that climb up into the &s;heepfold, and enter not in by Chri&s;t the door, who have their call and authority from an earthly power, and have not &s;een Chri&s;t nor heard his voice at any time; for tho' <HI>he was in the world, and the world was made by him,</HI> yet <HI>the world knew him not;</HI> neither doth the world know his &s;hepherds, and therefore &s;aith the &s;cripture, <HI>the world knoweth us not, becau&s;e it knew not him;</HI> as Chri&s;t &s;aith to his &s;hepherds, <HI>If ye were of the world, the world would love you, but becau&s;e I have cho&s;en you out of the world therefore the world hateth you.</HI></P>

mouth of the Lord, according to what is written, Jer. xxiii. 16. <HI>Hearken not unto the words of the Prophets that prophe&s;y unto you; they make you vain; they &s;peak a vi&s;ion of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord.</HI> Ver. 21. <HI>I have not &s;ent the&s;e Prophets, yet they run; I have not &s;poken to them, yet they prophe&s;ied.</HI> Ver. 22. <HI>But if they had &s;tood in my coun&s;el, and had cau&s;ed my people to hear my words, then they &s;hould have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</HI> Ver. 32. <HI>Therefore they &s;hall not profit this people at all, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> Now the&s;e Prophets were looked at in <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to be the true Prophets and me&s;&s;engers of God, and <HI>Jeremiah</HI> to be the fal&s;e Prophet, as in Jer. xviii. 18, <HI>chap.</HI> xxix 26, 27, <HI>chap.</HI> xliii. 2. <HI>Thou &s;peake&s;t fal&s;ly, the Lord our God hath not &s;ent thee.</HI> Thus they refu&s;ed to hear the voice of Chri&s;t by his me&s;&s;enger whom he &s;ent, not believing that he was &s;ent, but inclined their ears to the fal&s;e Shepherds, and would not believe the true. Now this Prophet whom they did not believe, but reviled and per&s;ecut|ed for a deceiver, was &s;ent, and did not run before he was &s;ent, though he had no call from the earthly power, yet was he called by Chri&s;t, &s;ent with the key of knowledge, and &s;o entered in by the door, Jer. i. 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19. Now when Chri&s;t &s;ends his me&s;&s;engers thus into the world, it is to be a witne&s;s again&s;t them that enter into the &s;heepfold, but not by the door, and to be a wit|ne&s;s again&s;t Kings and Governors for &s;etting the&s;e up, and main|taining them whom he hath not &s;ent. Thus Chri&s;t comes by his me&s;&s;engers, not to &s;end a me&s;&s;age of peace to the&s;e intruders, thieves and robbers, or hireling Shepherds, as Chri&s;t calls them, but to bear witne&s;s again&s;t them, and again&s;t their upholders; and there|fore it is written, <HI>You &s;hall be brought before Kings and Governors for my &s;ake, for a te&s;timony again&s;t them.</HI> And &s;aith Chri&s;t in another place to his brethren that did not believe on him. <HI>The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth, becau&s;e I te&s;tify again&s;t it, that the works thereof are evil.</HI> And thus Chri&s;t comes, not to &s;end peace to the&s;e intruders, who are the chief men of the world, but to &s;end a &s;word and to kindle a fire; and therefore the Prophet Jeremiah, chap. xv. 10. &s;aith, <HI>Wo is me, my mother, that thou ha&s;t born me a man of &s;trife, and a man of contention to the whole earth;</HI> for Je&s;us Chri&s;t's me&s;&s;engers always meet with but coar&s;e entertainment in the world, for they are &s;trangers to it; as Chri&s;t &s;aith to the world, <HI>I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me not in;</HI> that is, his me&s;&s;engers were &s;o to the world. Now the&s;e intruders that come into the &s;heepfold, and not by the door, but climb in another way, that is, &s;uch as are call|ed of men, and ordained of them, and not called nor &s;ent by Chri&s;t, tho&s;e the world will reward and re&s;pect, they will feed, and they

They covet no man's &s;ilver or gold, or apparel, but labour with their hands night and day, that they may not be chargeable to any, They con&s;ider Chri&s;t's words, who &s;aid, when he was upon the earth, <HI>It is more ble&s;&s;ed to give then to receive</HI> Acts xx. 33, 34, 35. The&s;e are reviled, reproached, and per&s;ecuted for the &s;ake of him that &s;ends, according to what is written, Acts xxviii. 22. <HI>For as con|cerning this &s;ect, we know that every where it is &s;poken again&s;t;</HI> but &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>wo be unto you, when all men &s;hall &s;peak well of you, for &s;o did their fathers of the fal&s;e prophets; but ble&s;&s;ed are you when men revile you and per&s;ecute you,</HI> and the like; <HI>for &s;o did their fa|thers the prophets that are before you.</HI> Thus they did to Jeremiah, chap. xx. 1, 2, and xxvi. 11, and xxxii. 2, and xxxvii. 15, and xxxviii. 6. I&s;a. l. 6. Yet the&s;e their per&s;ecutors made a great &s;hew in the world of &s;eeming wor&s;hip to God, by which they de|ceived the world and them&s;elves: They would fa&s;t, and make prayers, and keep &s;abbaths, and have &s;olemn meetings; thus they garni&s;hed their out&s;ide with a high profe&s;&s;ion of the name of God, but their in&s;ide was full of pride, and covetou&s;ne&s;s, and wicked|ne&s;s. But the me&s;&s;engers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they are &s;ent by him with a me&s;&s;age of peace and reconciliation to tho&s;e that repent and believe in God; for God will wa&s;h &s;uch from the defilement of &s;in: And his me&s;&s;engers were always &s;ent with this me&s;&s;age, viz. that it is purity and cleanne&s;s in the inward parts that God looked at, and not a flattering of God with the mouth and lips, when the heart is defiled and full of &s;in; and therefore &s;aith Jeremiah chap. iv. 14, <HI>O Jeru&s;alem, wa&s;h thine heart from wickedne&s;s, that thou may&s;t be &s;aved.</HI> And I&s;a. i. 16, <HI>wa&s;h ye, make you clean.</HI> This hath always been the doctrine of Chri&s;t's me&s;&s;engers, <HI>to make clean the in&s;ide of the cup and platter: To wor&s;hip God in &s;pirit and in truth, in the inward man.</HI> But this doctrine is grievious to the world, for they never &s;aw a clean in&s;ide wa&s;hed from the guilt and filth of &s;in, neither will they believe this me&s;&s;age, becau&s;e their lives are always with the unclean; the &s;trong man of &s;in hath ever kept his throne in them, and they never yet &s;aw a &s;tronger than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e; for their bodies are the habitation of &s;in, where the prince of

<P>IN the next place, let us come to the following generations, which were in the days when Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles were in the world; for rea&s;on will afford us, that the world had got better experience, in &s;eeing how their fathers had been deceived, and that by the&s;e intru|ders that climbed up into the &s;heepfold, and how that God puni&s;hed their fathers with &s;ore judgments, for the abu&s;e of his me&s;&s;engers, as it is written, 2 Chron. xxxvi. 15, 16, 17. <HI>And the Lord God of their fathers &s;ent to them by his me&s;&s;engers, ri&s;ing up betimes, and &s;end|ing; becau&s;e he had compa&s;&s;ion on his people, and on his dwelling place: But they mocked the me&s;&s;engers of God, and de&s;pi&s;ed his words, and mi&s;|u&s;ed his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord aro&s;e again&s;t his people, till there was no remedy.

<P>But now let us turn and look upon her again, now the&s;e me&s;&s;en|gers (before prophe&s;ied of) be come, even John the bapti&s;t, a man &s;ent from God, and al&s;o the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf: Alas! &s;he is now become a wicked and adulterous generation, and thieves and robbers are got into the &s;heepfold, garni&s;hing the &s;epulchres of the prophets, whom their fathers &s;lew, and appeared as Angels of light to the people, and &s;aid, <HI>If we had been in our fathers days <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould not have partook with them in the blood of the prophets.</HI> They pray and they preach, and they extol the &s;criptures of the prophets (whom their fathers &s;lew) very highly; yea, &s;o highly, that in them they thought to have eternal life, John v. 39.

<P>Now are we come to the age and per&s;ons to whom Chri&s;t put forth this parable, and tho' it &s;peaks to all times and ages pa&s;t, pre|&s;ent, and to come. As to the time pa&s;t, hath been &s;hewed, how that always the true &s;hepherds entered in by the door into the &s;heep|fold, they did not run before they were &s;ent, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as he was God, was pre&s;ent with them, and it was his voice that &s;pake in them; but tho&s;e that were not of his &s;heep, could not under|&s;tand his voice by his &s;hepherds, as in ver. 26. but his own &s;heep could, as in ver. 27. but his flock is very &s;mall, Luke xii. 32. Matt. vii. 14. And we &s;hall find, that this great &s;hepherd of the &s;heep did not run before he was &s;ent, as in John viii. 26. <HI>I have many things to &s;ay, and to judge of you, but he that &s;ent me is true.</HI> And <HI>ver.</HI> 29. <HI>He that &s;ent me, is with me, the father hath not left me alone.</HI> Thus we &s;ee the great &s;hepherd of the &s;heep did not run before God &s;ent him, but followed his calling, till he was about the age of thirty years, Luke iii. 23. But when he was called and &s;ent of God, he went into the meeting-hou&s;e and taught, but it was great|ly offen&s;ive to the people that were brought up under the hirelings, which they hired to teach them, Mark vi. 1, 2, 3. <HI>And he went from thence, and came into his own country, and his di&s;ciples follow him. And when the &s;abbath-day was come began to teach in the &s;ynagogue; and many hearing him, were a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;aying, from whence hath this m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e things; and what wi&s;dom is this which is given unto him? Is not this the carpenter, the &s;on of Mary? and they were offended at him.</HI> So we may &s;ee that the&s;e goats that are brought up under the thieve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, robbers, and hirelings, as Chri&s;t calls them, they are taught and in&s;tructed by their &s;hepherds, that none are fit to teach but the &s;cribes and learned men of the world; and becau&s;e they &s;aw their elders or &s;hepherds per&s;ecute Chri&s;t, they judged him to be a de|ceiver, that they were cur&s;ed that did believe on him, John vii. 48, 49. For the&s;e &s;hepherds, which were intruders, never had any vi&s;ion from the Lord, therefore the people under their teaching, always peri&s;h; their flock ever did and ever will be a depending upon their wi&s;dom, and their learning, and their &s;tudy, and there|fore never did, nor never will believe any that come from God by an immediate call and &s;ending. This is the rea&s;on of all the per|&s;ecution that ever was; for the&s;e intruders never had, in any age, any revelation from God, nor never would believe there was any
<PB N="28" REF="015068_0027_0F95AA42F81A32A8">
that is to &s;ay, in their day: They would acknowledge that the pro|phets, whom their fathers &s;lew, had <HI>immediate revelation</HI> from God, but would not believe any in their day, in no age of the world, and therefore always per&s;ecuted God's me&s;&s;engers with a confident boldne&s;s, <HI>That they were fal&s;e reachers, and &s;educers, and pe&s;tilent fellows, and troublers of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>BUT let us now take a de&s;cription of them from the mouth of of Chri&s;t, the great &s;hepherd of his flock, for he is the be&s;t able to give a de&s;cription of the&s;e hirelings, thieves and robbers, as he calls them; and when we have a de&s;cription from Chri&s;t's own mouth, we &s;hall have no rea&s;on admire why they were offended at him, to take it upon him&s;elf, as they judged, whom they knew to be a trade&s;man, viz. a carpenter, for going into the meeting-hou&s;e to teach; for tho&s;e that are in their &s;tate and condition, are liable to the &s;ame error and cen&s;ure. For, fir&s;t, con&s;ider their mini|&s;ters were wi&s;e learned men, not brought up to trades, or work, but to learning, to the end that they might be able to teach others; for they did not expect nor believe any immediate call from God; a fal&s;e church and fal&s;e teachers never had nor never did expect any revelation immediataly from God, neither did they believe that any had in their day; they al&s;o looked at them&s;elves to be God's church and mini&s;ters, not con&s;idering that they had gone a whor|ing from God, were degenerated, and &s;o were not now his church.</P>
<P>BUT to come to the de&s;cription that Chri&s;t gives of the &s;tewards or intruders into the &s;heepfold: They are &s;uch &s;tewards as cannot work for their living, and to beg they are a&s;hamed, for they are the learned men of the world. Now when they come to be turn|ed out of their &s;teward&s;hip [it is bad times with &s;uch then] the&s;e bad &s;tewards will certainly be as Luke xvi. 3. <HI>Then the &s;teward &s;aid within him&s;elf, what &s;hall I do? for my Lord taketh away from me my &s;teward&s;hip, I cannot dig, and to beg I am a&s;hamed.</HI> For the&s;e intruders lay heavy payments upon the people, but the receivers bear none of it, according to Chri&s;t's words, Matt. xxiii. 4. <HI>For they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be born, and lay them on men's &s;houlders, but they them&s;elves will not move them with one of their fin|gers.</HI> Here is two de&s;criptions of the&s;e &s;tewards, thieves, robbers, or hirelings, as Chri&s;t calls them; the one is, <HI>they cannot dig, and to beg they are a&s;hamed,</HI> which &s;hews they are the honorable men of the world. The &s;econd is, <HI>they are &s;uch as lay heavy burdens on the people, but bear nothing them&s;elves.</HI> Well, let us &s;ee what further de&s;cription Chri&s;t gives of them, viz. <HI>they are &s;uch as expect the up|per

rooms at fea&s;ts, and that men &s;hould greet them in the market, and to &s;it in the uppermo&s;t &s;eats in the meeting-hou&s;e, and to be called of men, ma&s;ter, ma&s;ter.</HI> The&s;e are very notable de&s;criptions that Chri&s;t gives of them, which will &s;tand good to di&s;cover them in any age or time of the world, whenever they &s;hall appear to deceive them|&s;elves or others, Matt. xxiii. 6, 7. But that which the&s;e deceive the world with, is, they will &s;it on Mo&s;es's &s;eat, or climb up into the &s;heepfold, under a pretence of expounding Mo&s;es law, and the prophets writings; and under a pretence of duty to God, they will make long prayers, and be very &s;trict in Sabbath-keeping, judging Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles for being &s;hort in their duty. And thus the&s;e blind guides will make clean the out&s;ide of the cup and platter by an out&s;ide &s;how of &s;eeming wor&s;hip to God, by which they deceive the goats, but kill and &s;teal Chri&s;t's flock from him; and by this means they feed and cloath them&s;elves, but their in&s;ide is full of extortion and exce&s;s: Yet Chri&s;t &s;hews that the&s;e mini|&s;ters, by the&s;e out&s;ide pretences, appear righteous to men, Matt. xxiii. 28. <HI>Even &s;o ye al&s;o outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocri&s;y and iniquity.</HI> But the&s;e thought in them&s;elves, that if they had been in the days of their fathers, they would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets; but they are puni&s;hing and putting to death them that they judge to be evil doers, bla&s;phemers, perverters of the nation, and deceivers; but it may be, they may be deceived as their fathers were before them, for thus they judged of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles; but they do ignorantly as their fathers did, as it is written, Acts iii. 15. <HI>Ye killed the Prince of life. Ver.</HI> 27. <HI>And now, brethren, I wet that through ignorance ye did it, as did al&s;o your rulers.</HI> And &s;aith Paul, 1 Cor. ii. 7, 8, <HI>But we &s;peak the wi&s;dom of God in my&s;tery, which none of the Princes in this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</HI> But however, they thought them&s;elves to be in the right way, and tho&s;e they per&s;e|cuted, they thought to be in the wrong way, as always a wicked and an adulterous generation doth. <HI>Upon this generation will be re|quired all the righteous blood &s;hed from the foundation of the world to this very day.</HI> Now it is to be ob&s;erved, that the fal&s;e prophets al|ways keep in friend&s;hip with the judges of the earth, and make an image of wor&s;hip to the earthly power; and they command all, both &s;mall and great, rich and poor, to wor&s;hip that image, or form of godline&s;s, and that no man mu&s;t buy or &s;ell, that refu&s;es to wor&s;hip the &s;aid image, that is, they mu&s;t not meddle with the ordinances of Chri&s;t, though they are &s;ent of God, but mu&s;t be

<P>NOW we have had a view of the &s;tate of the church in the time of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, and find, that they were as much de|ceived as their fathers that were before them, for all their high conceits and opinions of them&s;elves, but is a declining church, like to be deceived the third time, yea, &s;o often as &s;he declines; for though &s;he keeps all the outward rules of the &s;cripture, as exactly, and as &s;trictly as the&s;e &s;cribes and Phari&s;ees did in Chri&s;t's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me; for it is purity in heart that gives a true &s;ight of God&punc; <HI>It it the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in heart that &s;hall &s;ee God, and it is the path of the ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that is a &s;hin|ing light.</HI> It is not an outward form that makes a Chri&s;tian, but it is the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t in the heart that makes a Chri&s;tian, and to be led by it; <HI>for &s;o many as are led by the &s;pirit of God, are the &s;ons of God,</HI> and no more: The&s;e are Chri&s;t's &s;heep, and know his voice. Now when Chri&s;t's church is &s;o far declined, that &s;he is become a per&s;ecuting church, yea, an adulterous generation, then Chri&s;t, after &s;he hath had her time and &s;pace of repentance, and doth not repent, then he di&s;covers her delu&s;ions, by the bright|ne&s;s of his appearing in his me&s;&s;engers, and di&s;covers her &s;carlet colour, and decked with gold, and precious &s;tones, and pearls. Now though &s;he be thus beautified and glorified with outward ornaments, enough to win the affection of the whole world, yet &s;hall &s;he be &s;tripped naked, and made bare of all her outward or|dinances, and her &s;carlet coloured garments &s;hall be &s;een to be only coloured with the blood of the &s;aints and martyrs of Je&s;us, and that &s;he drunk only with the blood of the &s;aints whom &s;he con|demned for deceivers and deluded per&s;ons, and that the &s;carlet-coloured bea&s;t that &s;he rid upon, was only an earthly power that upheld her, and per&s;ecuted the flock of Chri&s;t, and &s;o became a &s;carlet-coloured bea&s;t, being &s;tained with the blood of &s;aints and martyrs of Je&s;us, and that her teachers were only com|mi&s;&s;ionated

and in&s;tituted, defended and maintained by an earthly power.</P>
<P>IN the next place, let us come to view the cautions and warn|ings that Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles give to the children of God, to be|ware of the&s;e out&s;ide gilded deceivers, that are garni&s;hed with an out&s;ide profe&s;&s;ion, but inwardly are ravening wolves; they will be very ready to judge &s;inners, and look upon their own fine gar|ment of ordinances of <HI>praying, &s;inging, expounding of the &s;criptures, keeping their Sabbaths, fa&s;ts,</HI> and the like; are forward to accu&s;e the woman taken in adultery, although they are every one of them guilty &s;inners them&s;elves. Thus they look upon their out&s;ide pro|fe&s;&s;ion, as if they did &s;ome &s;ervice to God, without any con&s;ider|ation that it is all &s;in and wickedne&s;s, and burden&s;ome to God, according to what is written, I&s;a. i. 13, 14. <HI>Your Sabbaths, &s;o|lemn meetings, and the like, they are a trouble to me, I am weary to bear them.

<HEAD>Concerning the Second or Go&s;pel Mini&s;t|ration.</HEAD>
<P>THE Second or Go&s;pel Mini&s;tration was repre&s;ented by the Tree of Life, the Fruit of which Tree is given to the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, through Faith in the Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that he may eat thereof, and live forever, and thus to overcome Death by the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> who&s;e State was repre&s;ented by the Tree of Life, which was in the Mid&s;t of the Garden of God.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Mini&s;tration was the Mini&s;tration of God's Ju&s;tice to the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, in which Mini&s;tration the Light of the &s;piritual Law of God was communicated to <HI>Adam</HI> and to his Po&s;terity, which gave them the Knowledge of Good and Evil, even the Knowledge of Sin, and this came by eating of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which was in the Mid&s;t of the Garden of God.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second Mini&s;tration</HI> is the Mini&s;tration of Life and Righteou&s;ne&s;s to the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, in which Mini|&s;tration God's free Grace and Mercy is mini&s;tred to him through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for in this Mini&s;tration the Cherubims and flaming Sword, which turned every Way to keep the Tree of Life (le&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> &s;hould al&s;o put forth his Hand and take of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever) is removed, that the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or

<P>Tho&s;e that are only under the fir&s;t Mini&s;tration, are under the Guilt of their Sins, and the Wrath of God, and have a Spirit of Fear attends them, who&s;e Kingdom and Glory is of this World.</P>

But tho&s;e that are under only the fir&s;t Mini&s;tration, they are under the Law, and not under Grace, and their Kingdom is only of this World; for they bear only the Image of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> and have only the Light of the moral Law, which is the Knowledge of Good and Evil, which Knowledge is the Effect of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil; by which Knowledge they &s;hall be
