<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT was an ancient Cu&s;tom not only among the <HI>Jews,</HI> but even among the Gentiles, long before <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> to <HI>Separate</HI> from common U&s;e, by certain for|mal Rites of <HI>Dedication,</HI> their Temples, Altars and Places of religious Wor&s;hip. And we find God him&s;elf expre&s;&s;ly approv|ing this Cu&s;tom in Re&s;pect to the <HI>Jews</HI> (who were his peculiar People, and ble&s;&s;ed with a more adequate Knowledge of his Name) ina&s;much as he vouch&s;afed his &s;pe|cial Pre&s;ence in the Places &s;o &s;eparated and dedicated by them. Of this, the Chapter, from which the Text of the following Di&s;|cour&s;e is taken, furni&s;hes &s;ufficient Evidence; and in the <HI>third</HI> Ver&s;e of the &s;ucceeding Chapter God expre&s;&s;ly tells <HI>Solomon</HI>&mdash;<Q>I have heard thy Prayer and thy Supplica|tion&mdash;I have hallowed this Hou&s;e which
<PB N="iv" REF="009011_0004_10306824EDADC960">
thou ha&s;t built, to put my Name there for ever; and mine Eyes and mine Heart &s;hall be there continually.</Q></P>
<P>AGREEABLE to this, the primitive <HI>Chri&s;|tians,</HI> even in the mo&s;t difficult Times (as we have the utmo&s;t Rea&s;on to believe) did not re&s;ort to any Place for &s;tated Wor|&s;hip, till they had fir&s;t <HI>&s;eparated</HI> or <HI>&s;et it apart,</HI> if not by public Rites, yet at lea&s;t by peculiar Thank&s;givings, and Prayers for a &s;anctified U&s;e thereof. And in the more pro&s;perous Days of Chri&s;tianity, when Kings and Potentates became Converts to its Truths, the&s;e <HI>Separations</HI> were per|formed with far greater Ceremony, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the more pompous Names of <HI>Dedications, Con&s;ecrations,</HI> and the like; in all which acts, <Q>the com|mon Prayers of the Church were not looked upon as &s;ufficient, without &s;pe|cial Panegyrical Orations, and Forms of Adoration and Prai&s;e more peculiar to the Occa&s;ion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SEE <HI>Bingham</HI>'s Eccles: Antiquities, who gathers this from <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> who has pre&s;erved an Oration delivered on one of the&s;e Occa&s;ions.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="009011_0005_10306826A4EA6C98">THIS Cu&s;tom was very early introduced into our Mother-Country; for we find <HI>Au&s;|tin</HI> him&s;elf, who has been &s;tyled the Apo&s;|tle of our Ance&s;tors, agreeable to his In|&s;tructions, converting &s;uch <HI>Idol-temples,</HI> as were fit for U&s;e, into Chri&s;tian Churches, by the Rites of <HI>Con&s;ecration.</HI> And in after|times it was expre&s;ly provided, that all Churches <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould be <HI>con&s;ecrated</HI> within two Years after they were fini&s;hed; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">&mdash;ut omnes Cathedrales Eccle&s;iae, et Conventuales, ac Parochiales, a tempore Perfectionis ip&s;arum, in&s;ia Dien|nuem, per Dioece&s;anos ad quos pertinent, vel eorum Auc|toritate per alios, <HI>Con&s;ecrationes</HI> acciperent.</NOTE> nor do our <HI>Laws</HI> take any Notice of Churches or Chapels, as &s;uch, till they are formally con&s;ecrated. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">V.

<P>NOW, it is to be pre&s;umed that, in the&s;e Laws and Regulations, our Fore-fathers were actuated by the &s;ame pious Motives that influenced the primitive Chri&s;tians; namely the Hopes (grounded on the <HI>old</HI> Te&s;tament, and more particularly on the <HI>new</HI>) that God would be &s;pecially pre&s;ent with them, to hear their Prayers and pardon their Offen|ces, in tho&s;e Places thus <HI>&s;eparated</HI> to his Service, and <HI>dedicated</HI> to his Name. And
<PB N="vi" REF="009011_0006_103068285E674F58">
thus run the Preambles of the&s;e very Laws them&s;elves&mdash;"<HI>Domus Dei, materiali Sub|jecto non differens a privatis, per My&s;terium Dedicationis invi&s;ibile, fit Templum Domini, ad expiationem Delictorum &amp; divinam Mi&s;e|ricordiam implorandam</HI>&mdash;"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid De Con&s;ecr. &amp; Reform.

<P>IN this Country, then, where our Church is far removed from the Government of her Bi&s;hops, and where it hath not yet been the Method (nor indeed would Circum|&s;tances always admit) before a &s;tated U&s;e of our newly-erected Places of Wor&s;hip, to &s;ollicit a &s;pecial Authority for <HI>Separating</HI> them to God's Service, in the expre&s;s Man|ner of any approved Ritual; all we can do is to pre&s;erve &s;o much of the original De|&s;ign of the Thing as <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> may war|rantably perform, and which, in &s;uch Cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="vii" REF="009011_0007_1030682C09D56520">
may be thought more imme|diately nece&s;&s;ary for Edification. We may meet on a fixt Day; and, in Conjunction with the common Service of the Church, may u&s;e &s;uch particular Forms of Prayer, and Sermons, as may be &s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion; profe&s;&s;ing before God and the World, our humble De&s;ire of <HI>&s;etting apart</HI> &s;uch Places to his Service, and keeping them continually &s;acred to that pious End.</P>
<P>THUS much is in the Power of every re|ligious Society; and thus much, at lea&s;t, as Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> it is our particular Duty to do, with all po&s;&s;i|ble Solemnity, Gravity, and Love to God, when&s;oever we <HI>devote</HI> any particular Place to his Service; in Order that for ever af|terwards, when we enter therein, we may con&s;ider our&s;elves as entering into the Place where hath promi&s;ed to manife&s;t his more immediate Pre&s;ence, and behave our&s;elves when there (as the primitive Chri&s;tians are <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chry&s;o&s;tom.</NOTE> &s;aid to have done in their Places of Wor|&s;hip) with the utmo&s;t Reverence and De|votion, as in the <HI>Palace of the</HI> GREAT KING.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="009011_0008_1030682DC7C9BE70">THESE were the Principles kept in View at the <HI>Opening</HI> of St. PETERS CHURCH in this City; and the be&s;t Te&s;timony for the Conduct of that Solemnity, is the Appro|bation it met with, even from &s;ome who came prejudiced again&s;t every Thing of that Kind.

<P>TO this &s;ucceeded the following SERMON; and if a Judgment might be formed from the Attention wherewith it was received by a very crouded Audience, and even by &s;ome who have given but few other In&s;tances of their PARTIALITY in the Author's favour; he may flatter him&s;elf that now, when it appears from the Pre&s;s, and &s;ollicits a candid Peru&s;al in the Clo&s;et, it may be of &s;ome Service.

<P>THE Author's Situation allows him but few Opportunities of addre&s;&s;ing the World in this Way; and tho&s;e hitherto have chiefly ari&s;en out of public Occa&s;ions, where the Calls were &s;udden, and where he hath only had Lei&s;ure to &s;hew the Warmth of the <HI>Heart,</HI> and not the Labour of the <HI>Head</HI>&mdash;Happy always, if with a De&s;ire to &s;erve his Friends, he can give any Te&s;ti|mony of a Zeal for Truth, and for that Church whereof he is a Member!</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My BRETHREN;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHOUGH I have only read to you the foregoing Ver&s;es, as being tho&s;e which I am more immediately to in&s;i&s;t upon, yet the greate&s;t Part of the Chapter from which they are taken, containing the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s <HI>Dedication</HI> of the Temple, and which has been already read to you as the fir&s;t Le&s;&s;on for this Day's Service, will be the Subject of my following Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT, before I proceed, it may perhaps be ex|pected that I &s;hould carry you back into remote
<PB N="6" REF="009011_0012_1030683A0909EF30">
Antiquity, to inve&s;tigate the Origin and &s;hew the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of CONSECRATING, DEDI|CATING, or SETTING APART, particular Places for the more immediate and public Wor&s;hip of the &s;upreme God. And &s;uch an Enquiry, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, would furni&s;h out a mo&s;t intere&s;t|ing Detail; no way un&s;uitable to this Day's So|lemnity. But the Time being &s;hort, and hav|ing another Plan in View, I &s;hall touch but &s;lightly on the&s;e Matters.</P>
<P>THE great Progenitors of our Race, ADAM and EVE, when they fir&s;t &s;prung from the form|ing Hand of their munificent Creator, no doubt, felt their Hearts bound with Joy and Gratitude unutterable. Every Thing within and without them contributed to heighten this Joy into the mo&s;t tran&s;cendent Exta&s;y. The Curio&s;ity of their own Structure, the Paradi&s;e that &s;urround|ed them, the unfading Beauty, the' eternal Ver|dure and yet continual Novety, of its Scenes (while they continued in their State of Innocence) led them, doubtle&s;s, at all Times and in all Places, into the mo&s;t fervent Acknowledgments of that Goodne&s;s from whence the whole pro|ceeded. Neverthele&s;s, it is no way improbable but that they had &s;ome <HI>con&s;ecrated</HI> Place, &s;ome cho&s;en Bower, by Brook or by Fountain, adorn|ed with all the bloomy Honors of Paradi&s;e, whi|ther
<PB N="7" REF="009011_0013_1030683BCB27F8E8">
(at &s;tated Times, and at proper Intervals) they might retire from the Heat of the Day, to offer up their more immediate Prai&s;es for <HI>creating</HI> Love and <HI>pre&s;erving</HI> Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT whatever may be in this, one of the fir&s;t Things we find their De&s;cendents employed in, after the Fall, was their &s;olemn offering up "the Fruits of the Earth, and the Fir&s;tlings of their Flocks", in Places &s;et apart for that End; and, after the Flood, NOAH no &s;ooner de&s;cends from the Ark than he is found erecting an Altar unto the Lord. <HI>Abraham</HI> too planted a Grove in <HI>Beer&s;heba,</HI> where he called on the Name of the everla&s;ting God; and this God him&s;elf, thro' four whole Chapters of <HI>Exodus,</HI> is found in|&s;tructing <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> how to erect and adorn that glo|rious Tabernacle that we read of there.</P>
<P>NOW the&s;e Places of Wor&s;hip were agreeable to the State of a People, in tho&s;e early Ages, migrating from Place to Place. But when Na|tions were &s;ettled, and di&s;tinct Societies formed, in the Place of Groves and temporary Taberna|cles, &s;uperb Temples were erected, And thus it was with the <HI>Jews,</HI> at the Time of errecting that Temple of unparallel'd Magnificence and Architecture divine, who&s;e <HI>Dedication</HI> or <HI>Con&s;e|cration</HI> my Text refers to.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="009011_0014_10306841BB19F1A0">AFTER journeying for many Years thro' the Wilderne&s;s, after &s;u&s;taining many bloody Wars with their fierce Enemies, that People had now got full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Land of Promi&s;e, and enjoy'd that happy Tranquility, which their Souls had long and earne&s;tly wi&s;h'd for.</P>
<P>AND now what Improvement doth their illu&s;|trious Monarch make of this Occa&s;ion? Doth he forget the GOD OF ISRAEL, that had led his People thro' &s;o many Dangers? Doth he turn the Fruits of PEACE entirely to Works of &s;ecu|lar Import, or of low &s;elfi&s;h Enjoyment? No!

of Mu&s;ic, to be heard in prai&s;ing and thanking God, than lo! a Cloud of thick Dark|ne&s;s, declaring the immediate pre&s;ence of the Glory of the Lord fill'd the whole Hou&s;e; &s;o that the Prie&s;ts dur&s;t not &s;tand to mini&s;ter by Rea&s;on thereof, but retreated to the outer Courts with the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>AND here let us pau&s;e, ponder and re|flect, on the Nature and Meaning of this wonderful Phaenomenon. Strange it may &s;eem that a GOD who is LIGHT it&s;elf &s;hould appear in thick Darkne&s;s. But let us not mi&s;take the Na|ture of this Darkne&s;s as any way &s;imilar to what we vulgarly call &s;o. Nor let us think that it was nothing more than the Pillar of Cloud, in which the SCHECHINAH, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>AS the SON of GOD, when he came into the World to re|deem Mankind, did, of his infinite Condecen&s;ion, take upon him their Nature as a Veil to his Divinity, that he might thereby con|ver&s;e with them Face to Face; &s;o the great JEHOVAH, in con|ver&s;ing with the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> did it by his divine SCHECHINAH, or the Pre&s;ence of his <HI>Glory,</HI> abiding under the Form of a Pillar of Cloud and Pillar of Fire.</P>
<P>THIS well-known Appearance it was that went before the <HI>I&s;|raelites</HI> in the Wilderne&s;s; that called <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> up into the Mount; that &s;poke to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ii. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Aaron</HI> and <HI>Miriam</HI> in the Door of the Taberna|cle; and that finally re&s;ted "over the mo&s;t holy Place within the Veil; and thence &s;poke from off the Mercy-Seat, that was upon the Ark of the Te&s;timony, from between the two Cherubims." <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Numb. vii. 8.</NOTE> And this former Dwelling of God among the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> by the SCHECHINAH, was all along a mo&s;t luminous Type of his Son's future Dwelling in human Nature.</P>
<P>NOW, outwardly this Habitation of the Pre&s;ence of the Divi|nity looked as a Cloud, but inwardly as a FIRE; and the <HI>Fire,</HI> or inward Part, was that which was more immediately termed the GLORY, and put on different Appearances according to diffe|rent Circum&s;tances. Sometimes it &s;hone thro the Cloud in &s;uch &s;erene and &s;often'd Lu&s;tre that it might be looked upon by common Eyes. Sometimes it prevailed &s;o much over the Cloud, that only the Eyes of a favoured few could behold it, and that too by repeated Efforts and by gradual Approaches. And &s;ome|times it broke out &s;o inten&s;ely &s;trong, eclip&s;ing the Sun, the Cloud and the whole Face of Things, that no human Eye could behold it, or any Thing el&s;e that fell within its overwhelming Splendors.</P>
<P>BEAUTIFULLY has the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Rabbi, <HI>Jehudah,</HI> expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf on this Subject, as he is quoted by Bp. <HI>Patrick.</HI> <Q>Of the GLORY mentioned in Scripture, there is one (&s;aith he) which all the ISRAELITES &s;aw, &s;uch as the CLOUD and con&s;uming FIRE; another of &s;uch a Nature that [only] the Eyes of the Prophets could &s;u&s;tain it; but another &s;o pure, and bright to &s;uch a Degree, that no Prophet is able to apprehend it, but if he venture too look on it, his Compo&s;ition is di&s;&s;olved.</Q></P>
<P>There are &s;ublime Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, beautifully de&s;criptive of the&s;e &s;everal GLORIES. Of the FIRST, where the Cloud and Glory appear together, in mild and &s;often'd Lu&s;tre, I have already mentioned &s;undry In&s;tances; and this it is which the P&s;almi&s;t de|&s;cribes, in P&s;alm xcvii. 2, 3. <Q>CLOUDS and DARKNESS the round about him, and FIRE goeth before him.</Q>&mdash;Of the SECOND Kind, where the FIRE or GLORY &s;o far prevailed over the VEIL or CLOUD, that only a favored <HI>Few</HI> could behold it and that at a Di&s;tance, or by gradual Approaches, we have a mo&s;t grand De&s;cription in <HI>Exodus</HI> xxiv. 10. as it was &s;een by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron, Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abibu,</HI> and the &s;eventy Elders&mdash; <Q>And they &s;aw the GOD OF ISRAEL, and there was under <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, as it were a paved Work of Sapphire-Stone, and as it was the Body of Heaven in his Clearne&s;s</Q>&mdash;or the united Splen|dors of all the heavenly Luminaries. And when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was to be called nearer to this glory, &s;ix Days was he in his Approach to it, while the Lord kindly veiled it before him, nor was it till the &s;eventh Day that he was taken into the mid&s;t of it.</P>
<P>BUT as to the THIRD GLORY, which in its unveiled Splendor eclip&s;es all the created Luminaries of the Univer&s;e, &s;eeing no human Eye has been able to behold it, &s;o no human Language has been able to de&s;cribe it, otherwi&s;e than by the Negative Terms of DARKNESS, or <Q>Light which no man can approach, or behold and live.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> vi. 16. <HI>Exod.</HI> xxxiii. 18.</NOTE></Q> For that which overwhelms and hides the view of all things el&s;e, and yet is it&s;elf beyond the Power of all View, mu&s;t, in re&s;pect to us, be the &s;ame as total DARKNESS.</P>
<P>THIS high Degree of GLORY is that in which the more im|mediate pre&s;ence of the Godhead &s;eems to have appeared on all &s;pecial Occa&s;ions. This it was that broke in upon St. <HI>Paul</HI> at Noon-Day, &s;o inten&s;ely &s;trong, that the Sun &s;hone to him in vain; for "he could not &s;ee for the Glory of that Light, but was led by the Hand of tho&s;e that were with him," who, it is pre&s;umed, &s;aw only a le&s;&s;er Degree of this a&s;toni&s;hing and overwhelming Light. This too it was that filled the whole Body of the Taber|nacle, at the <HI>Con&s;ecrating</HI> thereof, &s;o that <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who had entered into the &s;econd Glory and beheld it, was not able to enter into this.</P>
<P>CAN we doubt, then, but that it was the &s;ame Superior GLO|RY, dazzling and overwhelming, even to thick DARKNESS it&s;elf, that a&s;toni&s;hed the Prie&s;ts at the Con&s;ecration of the Tem|ple? Had it been the more u&s;ual Appearance of the Cloud and the Glory together, it is not to be imagined that they would have been driven by it from the Service at the Altar as they now were;&mdash;with a View, no doubt, in the Conduct of Providence, to "intimate that their Mini&s;try and Way of Wor&s;hip &s;hould cea&s;e when the Me&s;&s;iah came, in whom the Fulne&s;s of the God|head dwelt bodily." Indeed, we are expre&s;ly told that the Glory did, on this Occa&s;ions, break entirely out of the Cloud; and after it had filled the whole Hou&s;e, <Q>dazzling rather than enlight|ening (&s;aith the learned Bp. <HI>Patrick</HI>) &s;o that nothing el&s;e could be &s;een</Q> while it continued there, it &s;ettled at la&s;t in the mo&s;t holy Place.</P>
<P>THESE Remarks I thought nece&s;&s;ary, in order to ju&s;tify the Explanation that I have ventured to give of the Phaenomenon that a&s;toni&s;hed the Prie&s;ts, at the Dedication of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Temple.</P>

<P>JESUS CHRIST, who came not to de&s;troy but to fulfil the <HI>Law,</HI> frequented the Places of pub|lic Wor&s;hip, and &s;anctified the Sabbath by his Example. The very Form of Prayer, given by him to Mankind, at the In&s;tance of his Di&s;ci|ples, is a public Form. Nay the great De&s;ign of his Coming into this World and leaving his Go&s;pel behind him, was to accompli&s;h a Plan of Redemption for lo&s;t Mankind, to plant a CHURCH for him&s;elf upon Earth, and form his Di&s;ciples into one public Body, whereof him&s;elf is the Head.</P>
<P>BUT how can there be a CHURCH, where there is no Member&s;hip, no Communion, no "<HI>A&s;&s;embling</HI> our&s;elves together," agreeable to his appointment?

<P>WE do mo&s;t readily allow the private Wor|&s;hip of a Man's own Heart, its full Commenda|tion; and God forbid that any Thing here &s;aid &s;hould be under&s;tood as derogatory from that Wor&s;hip, or tending to &s;et in Oppo&s;ition to that which is public.

The Height of religious Perfec|tion

is when both Sorts of Wor&s;hip have their due Place; and however much a Man may boa&s;t of the Devotion of the Heart, if he keeps it there, the World will be apt to &s;u&s;pect him, and to a&s;k of him a Sign for the Edification of others.</P>
<P>UPON the whole then, it appears that a Ne|glect of the public Ordinances of Religion, in one profe&s;&s;ing to believe the Go&s;pel, is a plain Contradiction of that Profe&s;&s;ion, and a Breach of that Duty which we owe to God. And Oh! That it might never be forgotten by any one who <HI>names the Name of Chri&s;t,</HI> that it is only to tho&s;e who "confe&s;s him before Men," that he hath given the mo&s;t comfortable Promi&s;e of "confe&s;&s;ing them before his heavenly Father," in that awful Day of Accounts, when he is to &s;it ab&s;olute Judge of their Conduct.</P>
<P>AND yet &s;till, if &s;uch be the Ca&s;e in Re&s;pect to tho&s;e who, tho' they neglect the public Wor|&s;hip of God, neverthele&s;s pretend to a more pri|vate and &s;piritual Wor&s;hip of him; what mu&s;t it be with them who are avowed Enemies to both? Would to God that they would put the Matter to their own Souls in their &s;erious Moments; if, peradventure, they ever leave them&s;elves Lei|&s;ure to be &s;erious.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="009011_0034_1030687B97DE6D88">BUT, to proceed&mdash;we were next to &s;hew that the Neglect of public Wor&s;hip is al&s;o a Breach of Duty to Society. Much of what might be offered on this Head is anticipated on the for|mer; for &s;o kind hath God been to us, that whatever he hath commanded us to do for his Glory, is al&s;o for our own Good. Many Argu|ments might al&s;o be drawn from the Nature of Society; our common Wants, our common Dangers, our common Redemption, and our common Dependance for Happine&s;s here and hereafter, on the &s;ame Parent-God. But the&s;e may be pa&s;&s;ed over at pre&s;ent; it being general|ly acknowledged that Government and Society cannot be maintained on any other Principles than Ju&s;tice, Sobriety and Obedience. And the&s;e Principles cannot be maintained, in any tolera|ble Degree, but "for the Lord's Sake," and by Means of Religion and its divine Sanctions. And Religion cannot be maintain'd without a due Regard to its public Ordinances,</P>
<P>THERE is &s;omething as lovely and venerable, as it is truly ancient, in the Appointment of a Sabbath, or one Day in Seven, for a&s;&s;embling our&s;elvs together. By this Means, People are brought forth and a&s;&s;ociated in their mo&s;t decent Attire. They are humanized and poli&s;hed and made better acquainted. They provoke one
<PB N="29" REF="009011_0035_1030687F5E008AC0">
another, as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it, to Love and good Works. Nay, as the &s;ame Apo&s;tle fur|ther te&s;tifies, much greater Fruits than the&s;e may be expected. For, "if <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiv. 23</NOTE> the whole Church be come together in one Place, and there come in one that believeth not, or one un|learned; he is convinced of all, he is judged of all; and &s;o, falling down on his Face, he will wor&s;hip God, and report that God is of a Truth" in that Place.</P>
<P>WHENCE it appears that the Neglect of pub|lic Wor&s;hip is al&s;o a Breach of Duty to Society, and a Bar to the Reformation and good Order of Mankind. It was next to be proved a Breach of Duty to our own Souls. And here little need be &s;aid.</P>
<P>WHATEVER is a Neglect of Duty to God, whatever ob&s;tructs the good of Society, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be prejudicial to the Individual. Were Men wholly compo&s;ed of Soul and made entirely for them&s;elves, a refined &s;elfi&s;h and So|litary Religion might po&s;&s;ibly &s;uit them. But, as the Matter now is, they &s;tand in Need of all &s;ocial Helps to enflame their Devotion; and it is found by Experience that the Exerci&s;es of Religion are greatly quickened by friendly Communion with our fellow Creatures. On

&s;uch Occa&s;ions, when all Things are conducted with Decency and Order, a kind of holy Fervor is apt to catch from Bo&s;om to Bo&s;om, ri&s;ing to Heights which the &s;olitary Wor&s;hipper cannot ea&s;ily reach or conceive. In a Word, 'tis to &s;ocial and public Wor&s;hip, as hath been already hint|ed, that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour hath given many of the Go&s;pel-Promi&s;es. For he hath a&s;&s;ured us that if even &s;o &s;mall a Number as "two &s;hall agree on Earth, as touching any Thing that they &s;hall a&s;k, it &s;hall be done for them of his Father who is in Heaven." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xviii. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>THESE Arguments, 'tis to be hoped, may convince tho&s;e who neglect or &s;corn our <HI>Sabbaths</HI> and <HI>public Meetings,</HI> that they are, in Reality, acting contrary to their Duty to God; to Society, and to them&s;elves; and that if it were not for the wi&s;e Ordinance of a Sabbath, true Religion would &s;carce be found upon Earth. And if Religi|on were gone, Society could not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t, or at lea&s;t it could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the Principles of Virtue, Freedom and Safety.</P>
<P>AND this leads me to one Argument more, which, as it is of a worldly Nature, may per|haps be better heard. If we would wi&s;h to live happy and &s;ee good Days; if we would wi&s;h to &s;ee our Children dutiful, and our Families in

Subordination round us; if we would wi&s;h to have our Property &s;afe, and our Per&s;ons free from Violence; we ought to &s;upport the Credit of Religion, and &s;et forward the public Wor&s;hip of God, by our whole Influence, our example, and every other Means in our Power.</P>
<P>SO far in general. As to you, my Brethren, to whom this Di&s;cour&s;e is more particularly ad|dre&s;&s;ed, it is to be hoped that you will be per|&s;uaded to con&s;cientious attendance upon the public Wor&s;hip, the Prayers, the Fe&s;tivals and the Sacraments of our Church, not only from the above Motives, but from the nobler Motives fir&s;t mentioned to you, namely as a Means of continuing the divine Pre&s;ence among you, and obtaining that &s;piritual Con&s;olation and Fellow&s;hip with God, which, it is to be believed, were your &s;incere De&s;ire in contributing of your Sub&s;tance to the Erection of this Place.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Thing I mu&s;t recommend to you, if you would expect God to dwell among you, as a religious Society. 'Tis UNION and CHA|RITY with one Another. For St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> that where Divi&s;ions are among a People, they will come together in the Church, "not for the better, but for the wor&s;e."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> It is impo&s;&s;ible, indeed, in this World, while Men

have their Pa&s;&s;ions, their Vanities, their Inte|re&s;ts, and their Ambitions, but &s;uch Offences will come; and a good Man will be apt to cry out&mdash;"Is there no Balm in <HI>Gilead,</HI>" no &s;ove|reign Method to prevent or heal the&s;e painful Wounds? The be&s;t Way, indeed, is to practi&s;e all Chri&s;tian <HI>Forbearance,</HI> and to leave the Re&s;t to God's Providence; ever bearing in Mind that the Glory of a Church con&s;i&s;ts not in the O&s;tenta|tion of Numbers, but in the &s;trict Union and Fellow&s;hip of its Members.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Charity, Love and Candor, that you extend to one another, let me be&s;eech you, in a particular Manner, to extend to tho&s;e who are appointed to mini&s;ter among you. Judge of them with Impartiality. Bear in Mind the Difficulties of their Office. Con&s;ider that they are Men of like Infirmities with your&s;elves, placed by their Station in a very public Point of View; and thereby what Failings they may have are rendered the more con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>WHEN you enter God's Hou&s;e, let your Minds be impre&s;&s;ed with deep Sen&s;e of his awful Pre&s;ence, and "keep your Feet with all Diligence." Examine carefully into the Motives of your Appearing there; whether it be from an idle Curio&s;ity, or to have a momentary Warmth rai&s;ed in you merely by <HI>Preaching;</HI> or
<PB N="33" REF="009011_0039_1030688B96C400C0">
whether it be, in good Earne&s;t, to humble your|&s;elves before the Throne of God, and to join with your fellow Chri&s;tians in the Solemn Acts of Devotion; "in Supplications, Prayers, In|terce&s;&s;ions, and giving of Thanks for all Men," agreeable to the mo&s;t compleat Form of our excellent Liturgy?</P>
<P>PREACHING, my Brethren, was originally a wi&s;e In&s;titution, to in&s;truct the <HI>Ignorant,</HI> to rou&s;e the <HI>Dull,</HI> to confirm the <HI>Wavering,</HI> and to ani|mate <HI>all</HI> in the Di&s;charge of their Duty; and, as &s;uch, is &s;till retained by our Church as a very nece&s;&s;ary Addition to her public Service, and is moreover warranted by the Example of our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles. But then, here lies the Fault, that many will con&s;ider this <HI>Preach|ing</HI> as the principal Part of the public Wor&s;hip it&s;elf; and no Preaching will be acceptable to them that does not, as it were, hurry them out of them&s;elves, by captivating the Pa&s;&s;ions, as if that was a nobler and more u&s;eful Work than to convince the Judgment. Preachers there are, indeed, who can do both in an eminent Degree; and their Succe&s;s in this Re&s;pect is a Ble&s;&s;ing to the Societies to which they belong. But what we complain of is this&mdash;that the excellent Liturgy of our Church &s;hould be no Motive, or only a &s;econdary Motive, for frequenting her Ser|vice;
<PB N="34" REF="009011_0040_1030688E4CBBC018">
and that this wrong Ta&s;te of Hearers is apt to lead to a wrong Ta&s;te in Preaching, and draws Men of warm Tempers, &s;mall Abilities, and fond of Plea&s;ing, into Extrava|gances of Heat and Zeal, which Rea&s;on cannot ju&s;tify, and <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> requires not at their Hand.</P>
<P>AS the Re&s;ult, therefore, of what has been &s;aid, let me, in the next Place entreat you, as a religious Society, to "hold fa&s;t the Profe&s;&s;ion of your Faith without Wavering," without Le|vity, and without being "blown about by every Wind of Doctrine." I mean not, on this Occa&s;ion, the lea&s;t Reflection again&s;t any of tho&s;e who differ from us in their Per&s;ua&s;ion. They have, no Doubt, fully examined and con|vinced them&s;elves in the Faith they hold; and the &s;ame Indulgence which we freely extend to them, we only crave for our&s;elves. Seeing we al&s;o, as well as they, have embraced the Faith of a particular Church, we al&s;o, mu&s;t be allowed to have &s;ufficient Conviction in our own Minds for the Choice we have made. We mu&s;t be allowed to think the Faith of our Church the &s;ame that "was once delivered to the Saints." We mu&s;t be allowed to con&s;ider her Wor&s;hip as &s;ocial in its Nature; plain yet &s;olemn, and
<PB N="35" REF="009011_0041_10306891018B9970">
keeping the golden Mean betwixt tho&s;e idle Pe|geantries that di&s;tract the Attention to Things purely &s;en&s;ible, and tho&s;e illu&s;ive Reveries that pretend to Refinements which human Nature cannot reach. We mu&s;t be allowed to pay a due Regard to her ancient Di&s;cipline, her vene|rable Order and her wi&s;e Con&s;titutions, that were planned by Men of &s;uperior Eminence, and have &s;tood the Te&s;t of Ages. And, la&s;tly, we mu&s;t be allowed to look upon the&s;e Things as Matters, not lightly, wantonly, or ra&s;hly to be given up.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only detain you while I recommend one thing more to you, as a religious Society; and that is, a liberal and beneficent Spirit in contributing to all Works of <HI>Charity</HI> and com|mon Concern. And, on this Head, it is with Plea&s;ure that I confe&s;s my&s;elf almo&s;t ab&s;olved from the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;aying any Thing. I am rather called to congratulate you on the excellent Spirit that hath already been &s;hewn, than to doubt of its Continuance.</P>
<P>THIS Hou&s;e hath been almo&s;t wholly built within your&s;elves; by the free, voluntary and chearful Contributions of your own Members. Some have &s;pared in their Exigence, and &s;ome out of their Abundance, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">o with

<P>FINALLY, O Lord, we pray that <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> may prevail among all the Members of this Church thro' Life; and, at their Death, may they be tran&s;lated into the general A&s;&s;em|bly of the Church of the <HI>fir&s;t-born</HI> that are writ|ten in Heaven; where, being freed from all human Frailties, and admitted to the beatific Pre&s;ence, they may offer up unwearied Hal|lelujahs to him that &s;itteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever!</P>
