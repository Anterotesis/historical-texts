<HEAD>LETTER I. To the <HI>RIGHT HONOURABLE</HI> the <HI>LORD VISCOUNT P&mdash;,</HI> at <HI>OXFORD.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_BY the la&s;t New-York mail I received a letter from CHARLES, informing me of your Lord&s;hip's re|turn from <HI>Italy,</HI> and your re&s;olution of &s;pending a few months at <HI>Oxford.</HI> I well know your particular attachment to the agreeable &s;ociety of <HI>Magdalen-Hall,</HI> and
<PB N="2" REF="013258_0010_0F904C5DB5A27800">
could almo&s;t wi&s;h my&s;elf for a few weeks upon the banks of <HI>I&s;is,</HI> that I might be an humble partaker of that <HI>fea&s;t of rea&s;on and that flow of &s;oul,</HI> in which you bear &s;o illu&s;trious a part. But I mu&s;t &s;tay out the time of my tran&s;portation. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A merry allu&s;ion to the ca&s;e of tho&s;e con|victs, who are &s;entenced to be tran&s;ported to America for a certain number of years.</NOTE> Two years at lea&s;t was the period, which my good Lord H&mdash; allotted me to &s;pend in this, and one or two neighbouring provin|ces of North-America. Think not, however, that I repine at my &s;ituation. I am delighted with this country. <HI>The</HI> NEW WORLD <HI>is indeed launched forth,</HI> and has proceeded more than half-way <HI>to meet the</HI> OLD. But if the country it&s;elf was not &s;o charming, as it really mu&s;t appear to every impartial eye, yet I have been placed in &s;uch circum&s;tan|ces,
<PB N="3" REF="013258_0011_0F904C5E74486258">
as could not fail of making any &s;pot upon earth agreeable. I have been happily introduced to a &s;et of ac|quaintance, who&s;e ho&s;pitality, good &s;en&s;e, and good humour, do honour to human nature. I am entertained at a merchant's hou&s;e in this city, who is of the &s;ect of people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of as much urbanity and true politene&s;s as I have ever met with.</P>
<P>I am now &s;itting at a window, that overlooks the maje&s;tic <HI>Delaware,</HI> com|pared with which our <HI>I&s;is</HI> and <HI>Cherwell,</HI> though immortalized in &s;ong, would appear but little babbling brooks. The woods along the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> are clothed in their brighte&s;t ver|dure, and afford a plea&s;ing re&s;t and re|fre&s;hment to the eye, after it hath glan|ced acro&s;s the watry mirror. Whil&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="013258_0012_0F904C5F47008AA0">
I am writing this, three top&s;ail ve&s;&s;els, wafted along by a gentle &s;outhern breeze, are pa&s;&s;ing by my window. The voice of indu&s;try perpetually re|&s;ounds along the &s;hore; and every wharf within my view is &s;urrounded with groves of ma&s;ts, and heaped with com|modities of every kind, from almo&s;t every quarter of the globe.</P>
<P>I cannot behold this lively active &s;cene, without lamenting, that the &s;treams of commerce &s;hould ever be checked in their cour&s;e, or directed to wander in other channels, than tho&s;e which they now po&s;&s;e&s;s. Was your Lord&s;hip to be but a few months on the &s;pot, you would feel the force of this reflection; and I am &s;ure, your ju&s;tly-acquired influence in a Briti&s;h Parliament would &s;oon be exerted to &s;i|lence
<PB N="5" REF="013258_0013_0F904C5FEDAB7F70">
the clamours of jealou&s;y, and rec|tify the mi&s;informed zeal of true patri|oti&s;m. I know that you move in a much larger &s;phere, than is generally circum&s;cribed by the hand of party; and if you have hitherto voted on the &s;ide of Admini&s;tration, it was becau&s;e you have hitherto apprehended it to be the &s;ide of ju&s;tice: For your hone&s;t heart is ever ready to embrace TRUTH, even when introduced to you in the form of a JUNIUS or a WILKLS.&mdash;But I am not going to enter upon the field of politicks&mdash;This I leave to CHARLES, who has often told us, that he would not give a farthing for a conver&s;ation that was not well &s;ea&s;oned with <HI>religion</HI> or <HI>politics.</HI> I only mean to entertain your Lord&s;hip at pre&s;ent, with a &s;hort account of what I have &s;een and heard &s;ince I have been in this city.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="013258_0014_0F904C60C10D6CA8">Dean PRIDEAUX, in his connection of the Old and New Te&s;tament, &s;peaks of WILLIAM PENN'S having laid out his new city after the plan of BABYLON. Perhaps it might be difficult at this time of day to a&s;certain, what this plan was. Be this as it may, I am not &s;o well ver|&s;ed in antiquity as to be able to pro|nounce, whether there is the lea&s;t re&s;em|blance or not betwixt BABYLON and PHILADELPHIA. Of this, however, your Lord&s;hip may be certain, that no city could be laid out with more beauty and regularity than PHILADELPHIA. Its &s;treets cro&s;s each other at right an|gles: Tho&s;e which run from north to &s;outh being parallel to each other, as well as tho&s;e from ea&s;t to we&s;t. Not|with&s;tanding the va&s;t progre&s;s that has been already made, a con&s;iderable time mu&s;t elap&s;e before the whole plan is ex|ecuted.
<PB N="7" REF="013258_0015_0F904C63A83F7B68">
The buildings from north to &s;outh, along the bank of the Delaware, including the &s;uburbs, now extend near two miles, and tho&s;e from ea&s;t to we&s;t, about half a mile from the river. But, according to the original plan, they are to extend as far, nay farther, I believe, than the beautiful river <HI>Schuylkill,</HI> which runs about two miles we&s;t of <HI>Delaware.</HI></P>
<P>The principal &s;treet, which is an hundred feet wide, would have a noble appearance, were it not for an ill con|trived court-hou&s;e, and a long range of &s;hambles, which they have &s;tuck in the very middle of it. This may, indeed, be very convenient for the inhabitants, and on their market-days exhibits &s;uch a &s;cene of plenty, as is &s;carcely to be equalled by any &s;ingle market in Eu|rope.
<PB N="8" REF="013258_0016_0F904C66490B8570">
&mdash;But I am apt to think, that moveable &s;talls, contrived &s;o as to af|ford &s;helter from the weather, would have an&s;wered the purpo&s;e full as well, and then the avenue might have been left entirely open.&mdash;The &s;treets are all well paved in the middle for carriages, and there is a foot-path of hard bricks on each &s;ide next the hou&s;es.&mdash;The hou&s;es in general are plain, but not elegant, for the mo&s;t part built upon the &s;ame plan, a few excepted, which are fini&s;hed with &s;ome ta&s;te, and neatly decorated within.&mdash;The &s;treets are well lighted by lamps, placed at proper di&s;|tances; and watchmen and &s;cavengers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author has been mi&s;informed in this article&mdash;There are no &s;cavengers in Philadelphia yet, but it is hoped, that a regulation of this kind will &s;oon take place.</NOTE> are con&s;tantly employed for &s;ecurity and cleanline&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="013258_0017_0F904C6752BA4BD8">Almo&s;t every &s;ect in Chri&s;tendom have here found an happy a&s;ylum; and &s;uch is the Catholick &s;pirit that prevails, that I am told, they have fre|quently and chearfully a&s;&s;i&s;ted each other in erecting their &s;everal places of wor&s;hip.&mdash;The&s;e places too generally partake of the plainne&s;s and neatne&s;s of their dwelling hou&s;es, being &s;eldom enriched by any co&s;tly ornaments. Here are three churches that u&s;e the liturgy and ceremonies of our Church of England; but only two of them are under any epi&s;copal juri&s;diction. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the fir&s;t publication of the&s;e letters, the Bi&s;hop of London, at the earne&s;t reque&s;t of the ve&s;try-men and congregation of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s Church, has ordained and licen&s;ed their Mi|ni&s;ter.</NOTE> CHRIST-CHURCH has by far the mo&s;t venerable appearance of any building in this city; and the whole architecture,
<PB N="10" REF="013258_0018_0F904C68B0ECA0B0">
including an elegant &s;teeple, (which is furni&s;hed with a complete ring of bells) would not di&s;grace one of the fine&s;t &s;treets in We&s;tmin&s;ter. The ea&s;tern front is particularly well de&s;ign|ed and executed; but its beauty is in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t, by its being &s;et too near the &s;treet, in&s;tead of being pla|ced, as it ought to have been, forty or fifty feet back.</P>
<P>The STATE-HOUSE, as it is called, is a large plain building, two &s;tories high&mdash;The lower &s;tory is divided into two large rooms, in one of which the Provincial A&s;&s;embly meet, and in the other the Supreme Court of Judicature is held&mdash;The upper &s;tory con&s;i&s;ts of a long gallery which is generally u&s;ed for public entertainments, and two rooms adjoining it, one of which is appropri|ated
<PB N="11" REF="013258_0019_0F904C6906A94AB0">
for the Governor and his Council; the other, I believe, is yet unoccupi|ed. In one of the wings, which join the main building, by means of a brick arcade, is depo&s;ited a valua|ble collection of books, belonging to a number of the citizens, who are in|corporated by the name of THE LI|BRARY COMPANY OF PHILADELPHIA. To this library I have free acce&s;s by favour of my friend the merchant, who is one of the company. You would be a&s;toni&s;hed, my Lord, at the general ta&s;te for books, which prevails among all orders and ranks of people in this city.&mdash;The librari|an a&s;&s;ured me, that for one per&s;on of di&s;tinction and fortune, there were twenty trade&s;men that frequented this library.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="013258_0020_0F904C69D8B6CC28">Behind and adjoining to the State-hou&s;e, was &s;ome time &s;ince erected a tower, of &s;uch mi&s;erable architecture, that the Legi&s;lature have wi&s;ely deter|mined to let it go to decay (the up|per part being entirely of wood) that it may hereafter be built upon a new and more elegant con&s;truction. Mr. F&mdash;, the late &s;peaker of the A&s;&s;em|bly, with whom I have &s;everal times conver&s;ed, informed me, that the plot of ground on which the State-hou&s;e &s;tands, and which is one of the &s;quares of the city, is to be planted with trees, and divided into walks, for the recre|ation of the citizens. I could not help ob&s;erving to him, that it would be a con&s;iderable improvement of their plan, if the Legi&s;lature could purcha&s;e another &s;quare, which lies to the &s;outh of this, and apply it to the &s;ame &s;alu|tary
<PB N="13" REF="013258_0021_0F904C6A7052ED08">
purpo&s;e; as otherwi&s;e, their walks mu&s;t be very contracted, un|le&s;s they make them of a circular or &s;erpentine form.</P>
<P>The internal police of this city is extremely well regulated. You &s;el|dom hear of any &s;uch mobs or riots, as I am told, are frequent among their northern neighbours. The poor are amply provided for, and lodged and boarded in a very large and commodious building, to which they have given the name of THE HOUSE OF EMPLOYMENT; becau&s;e all &s;uch as are able to work are here em|ployed in the different trades or manufactures to which they were brought up. This building likewi&s;e &s;tands upon one of the city &s;quares,
<PB N="14" REF="013258_0022_0F904C6B3A1621E8">
and when compleated, will form a quadrangle, as large, and of much the &s;ame appearance, as &s;ome of our colleges. In pa&s;&s;ing through the apartments, I ob&s;erved and pointed out to one of the managers, who was &s;o obliging as to accompany me, an inconvenience, which he a&s;&s;ured me, would be rectified, as &s;oon as their funds would admit of it, <HI>viz.</HI> The want of a few little private rooms, for the better accommodation of &s;uch poor, as have formerly lived in good circum&s;tances, and who&s;e mi&s;ery mu&s;t needs be con&s;iderably heightened by their being obliged to board and lodge in the &s;ame common and open apart|ment, with the vile&s;t of their &s;pecies.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="013258_0023_0F904C6BEB577198">For the &s;ick and lunatick an HOSPI|TAL has been erected, by private con|tributions, under the particular coun|tenance and encouragement of the Le|gi&s;lature.&mdash;The building is &s;till unfi|ni&s;hed.&mdash;I walked round it&mdash;but did not choo&s;e to venture into this retreat of human woe, as I had formerly &s;uf|fered much from a vi&s;it to Bedlam.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was at breakfa&s;t one day la&s;t week with Dr. M&mdash;, whom I had &s;een at Oxford &s;ome years ago, he received a card to attend a Public Com|mencement at the College the next day.&mdash;As I expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of accom|panying him there, if it &s;hould not be inconvenient, he very politely called upon me in the morning, and took me into the apparatus-room, where the
<PB N="16" REF="013258_0024_0F904C6CB1F12BE8">
Tru&s;tees or Governors of the College were met. There is no place or &s;cene, that I have vi&s;ited, &s;ince my arrival in America, at which I more ardently wi&s;hed for your Lord&s;hip's pre&s;ence, than this. I accompanied the proce&s;|&s;ion of Tru&s;tees and Profe&s;&s;ors into their public hall. The Provo&s;t open|ed the Commencement with two or three Collects of our Liturgy, well cho&s;en and adapted to the occa|&s;ion, together with an excellent pray|er of his own compo&s;ition. The ex|erci&s;es were &s;ome in Engli&s;h, and &s;ome in Latin, con&s;i&s;ting of Foren|&s;ic and Syllogi&s;tic Di&s;putations, and &s;everal little e&s;&s;ays in the declamato|ry way, which the young Gentle|men, for the mo&s;t part, delivered with propriety of pronunciation and

action; though a Gentleman who &s;at next to me, declared, that the pre|&s;ent candidates were by no means equal to many who had received the honours of this Seminary. Their pronunciation of the Latin, indeed, &s;eemed to be a little defective; and yet they have an excellent pattern in the Gentleman who pre&s;ided during the acts, who &s;pake with great di&s;|tinctne&s;s, and paid due regard to the quantity and empha&s;is.</P>
<P>The peculiar attention that is gi|ven in this Seminary to the Engli&s;h language, is worthy of being imita|ted by our Univer&s;ities and Acade|mies at home.&mdash;They have a Profe&s;|&s;or here, who&s;e &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s it is to teach boys their native tongue gram|matically,

and in&s;truct them in the method of reading and pronouncing it with propriety. For this purpo&s;e, he is frequently exerci&s;ing them in little &s;peeches, extracted from plays, parliamentary debates, Roman hi&s;to|ry, poems, &s;ermons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and I am told, that the Seminary owes much of its pre&s;ent reputation to this part of its plan.</P>
<P>The Profe&s;&s;or of Languages has the Latin and Greek &s;chool in excel|lent order, both with re&s;pect to in|&s;truction and di&s;cipline; and he a&s;&s;u|red me, that he had &s;eldom le&s;s than eighty or ninety boys under his care.&mdash; The higher cla&s;&s;ics are read in the Philo&s;ophical &s;chools, under the di|rection of the Provo&s;t and Vice-Pro|vo&s;t,
<PB N="19" REF="013258_0027_0F904C6FAF8F1838">
who give lectures in Geogra|phy, Mathematics, Logic, Rhetoric, Natural and Moral Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>Upon the College has lately been engrafted a medical &s;chool, with Pro|fe&s;&s;ors in all the branches nece&s;&s;ary to complete a medical education.&mdash; So that they have now annually a cour&s;e of Lectures in Anatomy, the Theory and Practice of Phy&s;ic, Bota|ny, Materia Medica, and Chymi&s;try. Pupils from all parts of the continent, I am told, have crouded to Philadel|phia &s;ince this &s;chool was opened, as the advantages here are thought to be almo&s;t equal to tho&s;e in Europe. Nothing now &s;eems to be wanting to render this Seminary an <HI>Univer&s;ity</HI> in the large&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, but two

more profe&s;&s;or&s;hips, one in Divinity, and the other in Civil and Municipal Law. The fir&s;t of the&s;e, however, is &s;upplied by the Provo&s;t him&s;elf, who reads a cour&s;e of Divinity-Lectures, when any of his pupils declare them|&s;elves candidates for the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>One thing I mu&s;t not omit, which cannot fail of giving plea&s;ure to a be|nevolent heart; and that is, that to this College is annexed a <HI>Charitable School,</HI> in which youth of both &s;exes are in|&s;tructed in all the nece&s;&s;ary parts of a common Engli&s;h education. A mer|chant of my acquaintance a&s;&s;ured me, that he knew &s;everal in&s;tances of the happy effects of this charity; and a|mong the re&s;t, that the young man, to whom he intru&s;ted the chief part of his
<PB N="21" REF="013258_0029_0F904C71454BCA08">
bu&s;ine&s;s, had received his education wholly at this &s;chool.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Philadelphia, in the very center of the Briti&s;h colonies, the manners of its inhabitants, the benevo|lent and catholic plan of this Seminary, which exceeds any thing I ever met with at home or abroad, together with the moderate expence of a learned edu|cation here, are circum&s;tances, which, I am per&s;waded, mu&s;t give this Col|lege the preference to any that are, or may be erected in North-America; and I doubt not, but that the inhabitants of the We&s;t-India I&s;lands, many of whom have been well educated, and have an high ta&s;te for literature, did they once make the experiment, would &s;oon be in|duced by the &s;ucce&s;s to prefer an Ameri|can

can to an Engli&s;h education, at lea&s;t for the earlier &s;ea&s;on of their children's lives. For my part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, in &s;pite of all my prejudices in favour of our belo|ved <HI>Oxford,</HI> that, had I a &s;on, I &s;hould certainly choo&s;e to let him go through a cour&s;e of education at Philadelphia College, before I ventured to &s;end him to that Univer&s;ity.&mdash;For your Lord|&s;hip well knows, that what we princi|pally expect from &s;pending a few years at Oxford or Cambridge, are, the op|portunities we have there of conver&s;ing with men of genius, and forming &s;uch u&s;eful and agreeable connections, as may contribute not a little to our future happine&s;s in life.</P>
<P>The very ingenious Dr. F&mdash;N, who, your Lord&s;hip may remember
<PB N="23" REF="013258_0031_0F904C754D149648">
was introduced to you one evening at the D&mdash;of N &mdash;d's, and who has been celebrated all over Europe for his di&s;coveries in electricity, was among the fir&s;t projectors of this in&s;titution: And I recollect, a few days &s;ince, to have heard a Gentleman of this city, who is a friend to literature, and no enemy to Dr. F&mdash;N, expre&s;s an ardent wi&s;h, that he would relinqui&s;h his political employments, and once more re&s;ume the Philo&s;ophical Chair; adding, that the calm regions of <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> would, in his opinion, agree much better with the Doctor's genius and di&s;po|&s;ition, than the &s;tormy element of <HI>Politics.</HI>&mdash;Certain it is, that his fellow-citizens acknowlege them&s;elves much indebted to him for many of the ex|cellent in&s;titutions, that do honour to

<P>The College, however, is at pre&s;ent in good hands. Gentlemen of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction for learning and fortune are among its Tru&s;tees. The Provo&s;t is well known for his literary character and excellent compo&s;itions, both in Europe and America.

Your Lord&s;hip, I re|member, was a contributor; and ex|pre&s;&s;ed your high approbation of the liberal and generous plan, on which it was founded. This plan is mo&s;t reli|giou&s;ly adhered to; and though among nine Profe&s;&s;ors, there are but three of the church of England, yet this is not owing to any neglect or di&s;re&s;pect to|wards the members of our communi|on, but becau&s;e no more than the&s;e three have hitherto pre&s;ented them|&s;elves as candidates for any Profe&s;&s;or|&s;hip; and the Tru&s;tees never enquire into the religious profe&s;&s;ion, (provided it be prote&s;tant) but &s;olely into the li|terary merit and moral character of tho&s;e that offer.

<P>LIBERTY, dear CHARLES, is the genius of Penn&s;ylvania. Its inhabitants think, and &s;peak, and act from her immediate in&s;piration. The poore&s;t labourer upon the &s;hore of <HI>De|laware</HI> thinks him&s;elf intitled to deliver his &s;entiments in matters of religion or politics with as much freedom as the gentleman or the &s;cholar. Indeed, there is le&s;s di&s;tinction among the citi|zens of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> than among tho&s;e of any civilized city in the world. Riches give none. For every man ex|pects one day or another to be up|on
<PB N="30" REF="013258_0038_0F904C7A2BC189C0">
a footing with his wealthie&s;t neigh|bour;&mdash;and in this hope, &s;hews him no cringing &s;ervility, but treats him with a plain, though re&s;pectful fami|liarity. Offices or po&s;ts of honour give none&mdash;but &s;uch as every wi&s;e and virtuous man would allow to be nece&s;|&s;ary for the &s;upport of government. Literary accompli&s;hments here meet with de&s;erved applau&s;e. But &s;uch is the prevailing ta&s;te for books of every kind, that almo&s;t every man is a reader; and by pronouncing &s;entence, right or wrong, upon the various publications that come in his way, puts him&s;elf up|on a level, in point of knowledge, with their &s;everal authors. This, you will &s;ay, is not peculiar to the <HI>Philadel|phians,</HI> but may &s;erve as a general character for mo&s;t readers in the world&mdash; Be it &s;o&mdash;You may &s;ee in one portrait

the re&s;emblance of many a face&mdash;But the &s;trength of the <HI>contour,</HI> the particu|lar arrangement of the features, the countenance, or &s;ome other &s;triking circum&s;tance, reminds you of the friend that it re&s;embles mo&s;t.</P>
<P>I mean not by this ob&s;ervation to in|&s;inuate any thing to the di&s;advantage of the <HI>Philadelphians.</HI>&mdash;I love and ad|mire them too much to harbour even a thought of the kind. Their conduct uniformly flows from that &s;pirit of free|dom, which they inherit from a Briti&s;h ance&s;try, which has not been &s;uffered to degenerate, but has rather acquired new vigour by being tran&s;planted into an American &s;oil.&mdash;Freedom of en|quiry will nece&s;&s;arily lead to freedom of &s;peech; and though an hone&s;t mind will &s;ometimes be mi&s;taken in its opi|nions

of men and things, yet its very mi&s;takes are pardonable, ina&s;much as they proceed not from a depraved heart, but a mi&s;informed judgment. I love to hear a plain man deliver his real &s;en|timents with that downright bluntne&s;s, which is generally characteri&s;tic of inte|grity; though it may &s;ometimes be af|fectedly a&s;&s;umed to hide a deceitful, or countenance an impertinent, temper.</P>
<P>Sitting the other day in one of the coffee-hou&s;e boxes, I heard a per&s;on be|hind me giving his &s;entiments upon the letters of JUNIUS, one of which he had ju&s;t been reading: "I have no pati|ence," &s;aid he, <Q>with the admirers of this writer.&mdash;Fine-turned periods, brilliant &s;imilitudes, and choice ex|pre&s;&s;ions, may charm a &s;uperficial reader.&mdash;They are very pretty&mdash;but
<PB N="33" REF="013258_0041_0F904C7D12F491D0">
then their dazzling beauty &s;o capti|vates the inferior faculties, that the judgment is not at liberty to examine the &s;entiments, if there be any, which they are intended to recommend and enforce.&mdash;Take from JUNIUS all his well-dre&s;&s;ed per&s;onal invectives again&s;t his Sovereign and his Mini|&s;ters, and try to find out what is his real aim, or whether liberty is &s;o much in danger, as he would have us apprehend, from the D&mdash; of G&mdash; and his puny a&s;&s;ociates;&mdash; and I believe you will be tempted to think, that he is only playing a part in a <HI>Farce,</HI> who&s;e title &s;hould be <HI>Much ado about nothing.</HI>&mdash;For my part, I do really look upon all I have &s;een of his writings, to be no better than refined <HI>Billing&s;gate&mdash; Rogue</HI> and <HI>ra&s;cal</HI> would not have

<P>This <HI>critique</HI> upon JUNIUS, whether it be ju&s;t or not, &s;eems to agree very well with the appellation you once gave him, of <HI>the Knight of the poli&s;hed ar|mour.</HI>&mdash;For, I &s;uppo&s;e you meant, that his armour, though <HI>dazzling bright,</HI> was far from being <HI>proof.</HI></P>
<P>Parties, I am told, &s;ome time ago, ran pretty high in this place.&mdash;Some were for changing the <HI>Proprietary</HI> into a <HI>Regal</HI> government;&mdash;for what rea&s;on I have not been able to di&s;cover; un|le&s;s they could imagine, that the Ad|mini&s;tration at home, would be more anxious to pre&s;erve their privileges in|violate, than a <HI>family,</HI> who&s;e immedi|ate

members, though they have been here|tofore more numerous. Both men and women are dre&s;&s;ed in white linen for the &s;ummer, and woollen for the win|ter &s;ea&s;on. Their habit is a kind of long coat or tunic reaching down to the heels, having a &s;a&s;h or girdle round the wai&s;t, and a cap or hood hanging from the &s;houlders, not unlike the dre&s;s of the Dominican friars The men do not &s;have the head or beard. They are in general indu&s;trious, cheerful and ex|tremely &s;agacious.</P>
<P>The men and women have &s;eparate habitations and di&s;tinct governments. For the&s;e purpo&s;es, they have erected two large wooden buildings, one of which is occupied by the brethren, the other by the &s;i&s;ters of the &s;ociety; and in each of them there is a banqueting
<PB N="72" REF="013258_0080_0F904CA0865C5B60">
room and an apartment for public wor&s;hip: For the men and women do not meet together even at their devo|tions. The re&s;t of the building is divi|ded into a great number of &s;mall clo|&s;ets, or rather cells: each affording ju&s;t room enough to accommodate one per&s;on.</P>
<P>They live chiefly upon roots and other vegetables: the rules of their &s;o|ciety not allowing fle&s;h, except upon particular occa&s;ions, when they hold what they call a <HI>Love-fea&s;t;</HI> at which time, the brethren and &s;i&s;ters dine to|gether in a large apartment, and eat <HI>mutton,</HI> but no other meat. No mem|ber of the &s;ociety is allowed a bed, but in ca&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s. In each of their little cells they have a bench fixed, to &s;erve the purpo&s;e of a bed, and
<PB N="73" REF="013258_0081_0F904CA137646F68">
a &s;mall block of wood for a pillow. The <HI>Dunkers</HI> allow of no intercour&s;e betwixt the brethren and &s;i&s;ters, not even by marriage. Neverthele&s;s, &s;ome have broken through this re&s;traint, and ventured upon the conjugal &s;tate. The married per&s;ons, however, are no longer con&s;idered in full communion, or &s;uffered to live under the &s;ame roof, no, nor in the &s;ame village with the unmarried; but are obliged to remove to a place about a mile di&s;tant, called <HI>Mount-Sion.</HI> They continue indeed to wear the habit, and in other re&s;pects are deemed members of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The principal tenet of the <HI>Dunkers,</HI> I under&s;tand, is this: <Q>That future happine&s;s is only to be obtained by penance and outward mortifications in this life; and that as JESUS
<PB N="74" REF="013258_0082_0F904CA2B4E76560">
CHRIST, by his meritorious &s;uffer|ings became the redeemer of man|kind in general; &s;o each individual of the human race, by a life of ab|&s;tinence and re&s;traint, may workout his own &s;alvation.</Q> Nay, they go &s;o far, as to admit of works of &s;upere|rogation, and declare, that a man may do much more than he is in ju&s;tice or equity obliged to do, and that his &s;u|perabundant works may therefore be applied to the &s;alvation of others.</P>
<P>Thus do the&s;e poor people delude them&s;elves with vain imaginations, &s;eek|ing for that religions &s;atisfaction in their external &s;ituation, which is only to be found in the internal &s;tate of the mind. Devout and happy di&s;po&s;itions of &s;oul have indeed much le&s;s dependence up|on outward circum&s;tances than people
<PB N="75" REF="013258_0083_0F904CA375EC7180">
in general imagine. Men fooli&s;hly neglect to attend to religious &s;en&s;ibili|ties, or to cultivate a &s;piritual inter|cour&s;e with the great <HI>Father of &s;pirits:</HI> And then think to excu&s;e them&s;elves by lamenting their &s;ituation in life, as unfavourable to the&s;e purpo&s;es. Tho&s;e, who earn their daily bread by the &s;weat of their brow, are apt to imagine, that, if they were in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, they &s;hould have lei&s;ure to attend to their eternal concerns; but no &s;ooner does wealth increa&s;e, than their care and at|tention to it increa&s;e in proportion, and they find them&s;elves more and more embarra&s;&s;ed and le&s;s at lei&s;ure than ever they had been. Others think, that by re&s;olutely breaking off from all inter|cour&s;e and connection with the re&s;t of mankind, retiring into gloomy woods, burying them&s;elves, as Anchorites in
<PB N="76" REF="013258_0084_0F904CA460268B88">
caves, and denying them&s;elves even the innocent gratifications of nature, they &s;hall mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly recommend them&s;elves to the favour of Heaven, and &s;trictly conform to the idea they have entertained of <HI>&s;aints</HI> upon earth. But they &s;hould con&s;ider, in the fir&s;t place, that they attempt in vain to fly from their own evil di&s;po&s;itions, which will pur&s;ue and torment them in their clo&s;e&s;t retreats; and in the &s;econd place, that by retiring from the world, they lo&s;e the only opportunities they can po&s;&s;i|bly have of calling forth a thou&s;and tender &s;en&s;ibilities, and exerci&s;ing a thou&s;and tender offices of &s;ympathy, compa&s;&s;ion, charity and benevolence.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e, my Lord, this &s;hort digre&s;|&s;ion, into which my &s;ubject has almo&s;t involuntarily led me.&mdash;I will now pur&s;ue my narration.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="013258_0085_0F904CA500109230">Be&s;ide the two large buildings above|mentioned, the <HI>Dunkers</HI> have &s;everal &s;maller ones, chiefly for the purpo&s;e of manufactures.

<P>I &s;hall at pre&s;ent remark but one thing more, with re&s;pect to the <HI>Dun|kers,</HI> and that is, the peculiarity of their <HI>mu&s;ic.</HI> Upon an hint given by my friend, the &s;i&s;ters invited us into their chapel, and, &s;eating them&s;elves in order, began to &s;ing one of their de|vout hymns. The mu&s;ic had little or no air or melody; but con&s;i&s;ted of &s;imple, long notes, combined in the riche&s;t harmony. The counter, treble, tenor and ba&s;s were all &s;ung by women, with &s;weet, &s;hrill and &s;mall voices; but with a truth and exactne&s;s in
<PB N="79" REF="013258_0087_0F904CA6953156B8">
the time and intonation that was ad|mirable. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe to your Lord&s;hip my feelings upon this occa&s;ion. The performers &s;at with their heads reclined, their countenances &s;olemn and dejected, their faces pale and emaciated from their manner of li|ving, their clothing exceeding white and quite picture&s;que, and their mu&s;ic &s;uch as thrilled to the very &s;oul.&mdash;I al|mo&s;t began to think my&s;elf in the world of &s;pirits, and that the objects before me were ethereal.

&mdash;There is an hou&s;e in this vil|lage occupied by four or five brethren, who for &s;ome years pa&s;t have &s;e|parated them&s;elves from the re&s;t, on account, as it is &s;aid, of &s;ome diffe|rence with re&s;pect to their forms of di&s;|cipline and wor&s;hip. I had a long con|ver&s;ation upon this &s;ubject with a vene|rable old man, who is one of the ori|ginal proprietors or tru&s;tees of the e&s;tate. From him I found, that a further ac|quaintance with the reality of religion, (as it takes its ri&s;e and progre&s;s in the heart of man, and depends much le&s;s upon outward forms than inward com|munications from the fountain of truth) was the &s;ole cau&s;e of their &s;eparation. It was not, &s;aid the good man, that we were di&s;&s;atisfied with their particular form, but that we had di&s;covered the weakne&s;s and in&s;ufficiency of all forms;

and were therefore willing to anticipate in our own practice, that ble&s;&s;ed period of the church, when every true wor|&s;hipper &s;hall wor&s;hip God, "in Spirit and in Truth." Though the&s;e few brethren are not in communion with the <HI>Dunkers,</HI> they have a right to their proportion of the produce of the e&s;tate; and this, together with &s;ome little oc|cupation, which each of them follows, gives them a &s;ufficient &s;upport.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR CHARLES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the plea&s;ure to inform you, that we are like to be made happy very &s;oon with the company of our agreeable friend, Capt. L&mdash;. A copy of a letter which I have ju&s;t re|ceived from him, conceived and ex|pre&s;&s;ed in his own &s;weet and gentle turn of &s;entiment and language, I cannot forbear communicating to you. The original I pre&s;erve among many others, with which he has been &s;o kind as to favour me, &s;ince we parted. 'Tis dated

from <HI>Tu&s;culum,</HI> as he calls it, a little elegant rece&s;s, which his father has lately given him, on the banks of the <HI>Humber,</HI> a few miles above <HI>Hull.</HI> He writes as follows:
<LETTER>
<P>I am ju&s;t returned from an excur|&s;ion to <HI>Oxford;</HI> where I ran over in imagination, every &s;cene of plea&s;ure, which I once &s;hared with our worthy fellow-&s;tudents of <HI>Magdalen-Hall:</HI> Every field, every grove, every tree, that &s;urrounds the&s;e &s;weet retreats of &s;cience, reminded me of &s;ome morn|ing or evening walk, &s;ome plea&s;ing and improving conver&s;ation, in which I had borne my part. I al|mo&s;t wi&s;hed to occupy once more, for a &s;ea&s;on, the chamber in which I have &s;o often been ble&s;&s;ed with the &s;ociety of &s;uch agreeable friends.
<PB N="88" REF="013258_0096_0F904CAF8F9FA628">
But believe me, 'twas only for a &s;ea&s;on, that I formed &s;uch a wi&s;h. For my happine&s;s at pre&s;ent infinite|ly exceeds all that I have heretofore experienced, even when P&mdash; and M&mdash;, and you my much loved C&mdash;, con&s;pired to make me think my bli&s;s compleat. Twelve cheer|ful moons have now rolled round this globe, &s;ince ASPASIA was my own. An uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of calm dome&s;tic joys has crowned my ardent expectations. Every vir|tue that the female mind can boa&s;t is happily centered in my fair com|panion. Ble&s;t beyond my mo&s;t &s;an|guine hopes at home, I roam not now for happine&s;s abroad.&mdash;The lei&s;ure which peace be&s;tows upon the weary &s;oldier, I have wholly de|voted to her &s;weet and &s;oothing con|ver&s;e.&mdash;Happy,

indeed, if this lei|&s;ure could have continued &s;till&mdash;But alas! the call of honour mu&s;t &s;ilence for a while the voice of love.</P>
<P>A few days &s;ince, I received or|ders from General G&mdash;, to repair without delay to my regiment at <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI>&mdash;No &s;hip offering immedi|ately for that port, I have de&s;ired a friend in <HI>London,</HI> to &s;ecure me a pa&s;|&s;age in the fir&s;t that &s;ails for <HI>Phila|delphia</HI> or <HI>New-York</HI>&mdash;&s;o that in a few days all my pre&s;ent &s;oftening pro&s;pects mu&s;t be changed for the rude horrors of the boi&s;terous At|lantic. In expectation of &s;uch a call, my ASPASIA had &s;ome time ago, ex|pre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of accompanying me; and we &s;eriou&s;ly thought of facing the angry &s;urge in each other's arms:
<PB N="90" REF="013258_0098_0F904BA0B416CB08">
But the&s;e hopes are now di&s;&s;ipated by the pro&s;pect of a new connexion, with which the dear creature is al|ready alarmed, and which, as &s;oon as produced, will open a new &s;cene of tenderne&s;s and love&mdash;"<HI>Ca&s;ta, fave,</HI> LUCINA! would have been an heathen's prayer. But, as a chri&s;tian, I mo&s;t fervently be&s;eech the great God and Father of angels and men, that he would mercifully complete the work he hath begun, and that the be&s;t of women may not want a little &s;oothing comforter to cheer the lone irk&s;ome hours of her &s;hepherd's ab&s;ence.&mdash;Enough, however, on this melancholy &s;ubject.&mdash;Nought can alleviate my painful anticipations, but the hope of meeting with you and CHARLES in <HI>America.</HI></P>

But I knew you too well to think, that you were engaged in any mini&s;terial &s;ervices, or that aught but your own curio&s;ity, and thir&s;t of knowledge, had carried you from home.

<P>I always thought, my dear CHARLES, that our Captain's temper and di&s;po&s;iti|on were more &s;uited to the mild and gentle offices of private and dome&s;tic life, than the hurrying and turbulent employments of war. Courage he ne|ver wanted. But it is not of the furi|ous, fiery kind. 'Tis like him&s;elf, &s;teady, firm and compo&s;ed. Lord GRANBY once told his father in <HI>Germa|ny,</HI> that though he was not formed for enterprize, there was not an officer un|der

his command, that maintained his po&s;t and executed what he had to do with more re&s;olution and firmne&s;s than young GEORGE. He has an high &s;en&s;e of honour, but it is under the controul of religion. No man that knows him doubts his courage; though he has fre|quently declared, that he de&s;pi&s;es that paltry kind of honour, which is to be gained or lo&s;t by accepting or refu&s;ing a challenge.&mdash;He is not afraid to fight: &mdash;He is not afraid to die:&mdash;But he is afraid to offend his Maker, by wan|tonly &s;porting with that life, which he received from him, and which he only has a right to di&s;po&s;e of.

If this letter &s;hould meet your Lord&s;hip, preparing to go to Court or Parliament, lay it down, when you have read thus far.&mdash; Its contents ought not to interfere with matters of higher concern.&mdash;They are only intended for the innocent amu&s;ement of your lei&s;ure moments; the poor accompli&s;hment of a promi&s;e, which your Lord&s;hip conde&s;cended to exact from me at parting.</P>

The eye is weary with a repetition of &s;cenes, in which it di&s;|covers a perpetual &s;amene&s;s, though heightened by all the refinements of ta&s;te. Excellency it&s;elf, in works of human art, cloys the faculties, if the mind is not now and then relieved by objects of inferior beauty.

<P>I HAD the honour of your Lord|&s;hip's very obliging letter by Capt. L&mdash;, who after a mo&s;t turbulent pa&s;&s;age, arrived here on the 10th in|&s;tant. My friend the merchant intro|duced him to me the next morning, whil&s;t I was &s;itting pen&s;ive in my cham|ber, as a Gentleman ju&s;t arrived from <HI>England,</HI> who had a&s;ked very particu|larly after me.&mdash;As he was dre&s;&s;ed in a plain brown &s;uit of cloaths. I did not immediately know him, having been

long accu&s;tomed to &s;ee him in regi|mentals.&mdash;But the moment he &s;pake, and &s;miled, I recognized my fellow &s;tudent, and we embraced each other with all the affection of our juvenile friend&s;hip. He &s;oon opened to me the my&s;tery of his new garb, by informing me, that he had been advi&s;ed by his friends, and particularly by your Lord|&s;hip, to &s;olicit one of the new appoint|ments in <HI>N. America,</HI> and as a prepara|tive to this, to di&s;po&s;e of his commi&s;&s;i|on without delay; that accordingly he had lo&s;t no time,&mdash;Sir J&mdash;n H&mdash;t having been glad of the opportunity of purcha&s;ing for his nephew, who im|mediately embarked for <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> to join the regiment;&mdash; that backed by your Lord&s;hip's intere&s;t, and the per&s;onal application of LADY CAROLINE, he ob|tained from Lord N&mdash;H a patent for
<PB N="129" REF="013258_0137_0F904BC34260C7A8">
the office of&mdash; in &mdash;; that the death of his father, and of Mrs. L&mdash;'s aunt about the &s;ame time, had thrown a gloom over his little <HI>Tu&s;|culum,</HI> damped the wonted chearfulne&s;s of their evening fire-&s;ide, and deter|mined him to part with that agreeable rece&s;s, and remove Mrs. L&mdash;, who had now ble&s;&s;ed him with a pre|cious pledge of their love, to a &s;eat of his uncle's, near <HI>Beverley;</HI> that he would not venture to bring her with him to <HI>America,</HI> 'till he had fixed upon the place of his re&s;idence, and got eve|ry thing accommodated for her recep|tion.</P>
<P>I could not but expre&s;s my approba|tion of this change in his circum&s;tan|ces; at the &s;ame time that I &s;incerely &s;ympathized with him upon the melan|choly

events that produced it.&mdash;The emoluments of his office, together with the ca&s;h into which he has converted his little e&s;tate, will enable him to live with elegance as well as comfort in &mdash;. He will be fixed in a very agreeable and polite neighbourhood; and enjoy all that dome&s;tic felicity, af|ter which his heart has &s;o long a&s;pired. For my part, I confe&s;s, that my fond|e&s;t wi&s;hes would be gratified, could I obtain &s;o decent and honourable a pro|vi&s;ion for life. Experience has taught me to feel the truth, which the poet &s;weetly &s;ings,

Pilgrims we certainly are in this world&mdash; and I know of no con&s;ideration, that can alleviate the numberle&s;s evils, and di&s;appointments to which we are &s;ub|ject whil&s;t we are here, but this;&mdash; that we belong to another world, which was our <HI>original,</HI> and mu&s;t be our <HI>final</HI> home&mdash;that the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our ex|i&s;tence, is no other than a &s;tate of pu|rification; and that according to &s;crip|ture, rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, our felicity here, as well as hereafter, mu&s;t wholly depend upon an immediate in|tercour&s;e opened and continued betwixt our &s;pirits, and the ETERNAL SOURCE of GOODNESS. This your Lord&s;hip knows is not <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> but true rati|onal <HI>&s;criptural</HI> religion.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince our friend's arrival, my time has been almo&s;t wholly taken up
<PB N="132" REF="013258_0140_0F904BC56BEFD168">
in going round with him, and vi&s;iting the &s;everal places in and about this <HI>Me|tropolis,</HI> which are worthy the attenti|on of a &s;tranger. The other day, whil&s;t we were walking in the public hall of the college with the <HI>Provo&s;t,</HI> and a clergyman from the i&s;land of <HI>Barbados,</HI> who was formerly of <HI>Merton-College, Oxford,</HI> I took the liberty of a&s;king the latter, whether he thought a <HI>private</HI> or <HI>public</HI> education mo&s;t advantageous. He did not he&s;itate to pronounce in fa|vour of an education at a public &s;chool; &mdash;and advanced &s;everal rea&s;ons in &s;up|port of his opinion, that appeared to me clear and convincing; but added at the &s;ame time, that he could not help thinking, that the advantages of a pub|lic education would be much more con&s;iderable, were the per&s;ons concern|ed in the management of &s;eminaries,
<PB N="133" REF="013258_0142_0F904BC6DD2A2408">
to allow them&s;elves more latitude in their modes of teaching, as well as in the choice of &s;ubjects for their lec|tures.</P>
<P>To be in&s;tructed, &s;aid he, in the learned languages, in the &s;everal bran|ches of &s;cience, and the deeper parts of philo&s;ophy, is not the whole intent of &s;ending youth to a public &s;chool. The&s;e may be acquired, perhaps, to an equal perfection under a private tutor at home. But every parent has a right to expect, when he is at the expence of giving his child a regular <HI>univer&s;ity</HI> education, that he &s;hould be turned out, not only a good &s;cholar, but a well-bred gentle|man; and that he &s;hould be equally capable of &s;hining in conver&s;ation and in writing.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="013258_0141_0F904BC84F006888">The <HI>Provo&s;t</HI> being obliged to leave us, as it was his lecture hour, and the morning being remarkably fine, we agreed to take a walk to the <HI>Proprietor</HI>'s garden, as 'tis called, a plea&s;ant little &s;pot upon the bank of the &s;weet river <HI>Schuylkill.</HI></P>
<P>During our walk, the conver&s;ation we had begun in the <HI>Publick Hall</HI> was re&s;umed. Our friend L&mdash;ob&s;er|ved, that there were many qualificati|ons and accompli&s;hments, which, tho' not of primary con&s;ideration, were ne|verthele&s;s of infinite &s;ervice, nay, indi&s;|pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et off our im|provements in knowledge.&mdash;Can any thing, for in&s;tance, &s;aid he, be more agreeable and engaging, than a ready, polite, and unaffected method of deli|vering one's &s;entiments both in writing
<PB N="135" REF="013258_0143_0F904BC9CB387B78">
and conver&s;ation, without that &s;tarch|ed, preci&s;e and pedantic turn of &s;tile and manner, which generally charac|terizes the mere &s;cholar? Can any thing have an happier effect, either in a pri|vate company, or a publick audience, than an ea&s;y, free, and uncon&s;trained ge&s;ture, accompanying a di&s;tinct, grace|ful, and harmonious manner of &s;peak|ing? Or what can afford more &s;atisfac|tion to our&s;elves, or more entertain|ment to our friends, than a well culti|vated <HI>ta&s;te</HI> for the beauties of art and nature? Now all the&s;e powers are more or le&s;s in every human Being; and there is no time of life &s;o proper and convenient for the calling them forth, as tho&s;e early years, which are general|ly &s;pent at &s;chool. 'Tis by <HI>imitation</HI> and <HI>emulation</HI> alone, that the&s;e latent &s;eeds of genius are to be awakened and
<PB N="136" REF="013258_0144_0F904BCADA61EBE8">
improved; and 'tis well known, that a fondne&s;s of the&s;e is one of the prevail|ing pa&s;&s;ions of youth.</P>
<P>Had man been intended for a &s;olitary Being, then indeed the&s;e qualifications could have been of little u&s;e to him: But as his nature points him out for &s;o|ciety, his duty, as well as intere&s;t, ought to lead him to &s;uch an exertion of his talents, as will render him u&s;eful and agreeable to all around.&mdash;A mere &s;cholar is &s;carcely tolerable; and I ne|ver &s;hall forget the ridiculous appear|ance, which one of our mo&s;t learned Doctors of <HI>Maudlin</HI> always made in a circle of polite company, and even among us his pupils in the lecture-room. I cannot but think it a misfortune to him&s;elf, to his friends and the public,
<PB N="137" REF="013258_0145_0F904BCB73D4D068">
that a man of Dr. T&mdash;'s &s;uperior knowledge and abilities, for want of a few nece&s;&s;ary external graces, which he might have acquired twenty years ago with the greate&s;t ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, &s;hould be doomed to &s;pend his days in ob&s;curity, clo&s;etted up with a parcel of mu&s;ty authors, and incapable of ma|king that figure in &s;ocial life and polite conver&s;ation, which his di&s;tingui&s;hed talents would otherwi&s;e have enabled him to do. At pre&s;ent he can neither do ju&s;tice to his own abilities, nor ren|der them of any great &s;ervice to others.</P>
<P>Here the good clergyman replied, with a mildne&s;s peculiar to his character, that the fate of Dr. T&mdash; might not attend every one, who had mi&s;&s;ed the opportunity of obtaining the&s;e ac|compli&s;hments in his younger years at
<PB N="138" REF="013258_0146_0F904BCC344E9448">
a publick &s;chool.&mdash;Some, he ob&s;erved, were furni&s;hed with them by the boun|ty of nature; and others very readily acquired them by falling into polite company, after they had fini&s;hed their &s;tudies.</P>
<P>True, Sir, an&s;wered our friend&mdash; I am acquainted with &s;everal ingenious gentlemen, who are &s;olely indebted to nature or the beau-monde for many ami|able external qualifications, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s. I grant that a youth of nice ob|&s;ervation, mature judgment and a &s;prightly natural di&s;po&s;ition, may im|prove his ta&s;te, correct his manners, and fit him&s;elf to adorn the &s;ocial life, by frequently conver&s;ing with &s;uch per|&s;ons, as have added to an exten&s;ive erudition the mo&s;t refined ta&s;te, and all the graces of carriage and behavi|our.
<PB N="139" REF="013258_0147_0F904BCCEA8D1CB8">
But then, experience mu&s;t have informed us, that there are few who do not think them&s;elves &s;ufficiently accom|pli&s;hed, after they have gone through their cour&s;e of &s;tudies at a public &s;chool; and con&s;equently look upon it as beneath them, when they come abroad into the world, to copy after the ta&s;te, behavi|our or conver&s;ation of other men: To which I might add, that the circum|&s;tances of &s;ome &s;cholars will not allow them an opportunity of keeping &s;uch company, as would contribute to their improvement in the&s;e things. And hence it becomes a matter of the utmo&s;t importance, that the ma&s;ters and tutors of our public &s;eminaries &s;hould not on|ly be men of &s;ound learning, but po|lite, well bred, and of the mo&s;t ea&s;y, gentle and engaging deportment.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="013258_0148_0F904BCDB4F0F2B0">Be&s;ides, continued Mr. L&mdash;, there are &s;ome of the qualifications that have been mentioned, which are neither to be obtained from conver&s;ation with the polite world, nor yet are given en|tirely to any one by the indulgence of nature.</P>
<P>To in&s;tance only one of the&s;e: Whence comes it, that we have &s;o few eminent &s;peakers either in the pulpit or at the bar? Were the amiable gra|ces of &s;peech &s;olely in the gift of na|ture, or were they to be acquired by frequenting the genteele&s;t company and conver&s;ing with the polite&s;t part of mankind, I can &s;carcely imagine that the number of orators would be &s;o &s;mall, or that tho&s;e whom nature hath ble&s;&s;ed, perhaps, with many other graces and accompli&s;hments, and who&s;e &s;tations
<PB N="141" REF="013258_0149_0F904BCE6C7689B0">
in life always entitle them to a&s;&s;ociate with the highe&s;t and be&s;t of men, &s;hould be &s;o generally deficient in the art of <HI>&s;peaking well.</HI> For my part, I can attribute this to no other cau&s;e than the too common neglect of this nece&s;&s;a|ry branch of education at mo&s;t of our public &s;chools. And hence it is, that a late ingenious and polite writer com|plains, "that the mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed er|ror of an univer&s;ity education is the ge|neral neglect of all tho&s;e little qualifica|tions and accompli&s;hments, which make up the character of a well-bred man, and the general attention to what is called deep learning."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Guardian.</NOTE></P>
<P>After having expre&s;&s;ed my approba|tion of the&s;e &s;entiments in general, I only begged leave to ob&s;erve, that
<PB N="142" REF="013258_0150_0F904BCF2C7EEA38">
though the &s;eeds or principles of know|ledge, ta&s;te and every graceful accom|pli&s;hment were undoubtedly implanted in every human brea&s;t, yet nature had &s;trongly pointed out &s;ome predominant powers in each individual, &s;ufficiently characteri&s;tic of that particular excel|lence, by which, if properly attended to and improved, each might become u&s;e|ful and illu&s;trious in his own proper &s;phere.&mdash;To watch the&s;e dawning pow|ers, to take the mo&s;t proper method of &s;trengthening and improving them, and to direct the youthful mind to &s;uch &s;tu|dies, and employments in life, as appear be&s;t adapted to its peculiar genius, mu&s;t &s;urely be the principal objects of the tu|tor's attention.

<PB N="143" REF="013258_0151_0F904BCFF2AA2F30">
And from an inattention to, or impro|per treatment of, the&s;e buds of excel|lence, many have withered away with|out producing fruits or blo&s;&s;oms.</P>
<P>After taking a few turns in the gar|den, we walked back again to the <HI>Col|lege,</HI> where we had appointed to meet the mode&s;t and ingenious Mr. RIT|TENHOUSE, who, without one &s;ingle advantage from a private tutor, or public education, by the mere force of genius and indu&s;try, may now ju&s;tly be reckoned the FIRST ASTRONOMER and MATHEMATICIAN in the world.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR CHARLES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHY will you &s;eek to draw me into a religious di&s;pute?&mdash;I have often told you, that I looked up|on polemics in divinity to be unprofita|ble, and much more injurious to the chri&s;tian temper, than in any of the other &s;ciences. 'Tis not the cau&s;e of truth and goodne&s;s e&s;&s;entially and &s;imply con&s;idered; but it is merely their own private opinion, or that of &s;ome great Doctor, or leader of a &s;ect, that men in
<PB N="146" REF="013258_0154_0F904BD38DEEE500">
general are zealous to maintain. The reformation of the heart and life is the great and only end of true religion: and I cannot think this end will ever be promoted by &s;uch controver&s;ies as have a tendency to kindle up wrath, or pro|duce bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit; however the advocates on either &s;ide may flatter them&s;elves, that they are zealous for the honour of God, and ardently de&s;i|rous of re&s;cuing their friends or neigh|bours from the dominion of error.</P>
<P>When I was la&s;t at <HI>New-York,</HI> I was really forfeited with the conver&s;ation of one of your <HI>Methodi&s;t Saints.</HI> Such an air of arrogance and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency ap|peared even in his vehement declamati|ons again&s;t the pride and &s;elf-righteou&s;|ne&s;s of human nature, that I was a&s;to|ni&s;hed to &s;ee a per&s;on of your u&s;ual pe|netration

&s;o duped by an enthu&s;ia&s;tical pretender, as not to di&s;cover the work|ings of an evil temper under the flim&s;y, flaunting veil of a fal&s;e and hypocriti|cal zeal. My heart deceives me greatly, if I have not an high veneration, and &s;incere love for all good men, however they differ from one another or my&s;elf. The marks of goodne&s;s, indeed, I have always looked for in the temper and conduct: and where the&s;e fail, the au|thor of my religion hath taught me to pronounce all other pretences vain and delu&s;ive.</P>
<P>I was once acquainted with a foreign clergyman, who was perfectly ma&s;ter of all the canting peculiarities, which di&s;tingui&s;h the brethren of the conven|ticle. I thought him at fir&s;t much in earne&s;t, and e&s;teemed him as an hone&s;t

man, though his notions were very dif|ferent from mine. But he &s;oon forfeit|ed my friend&s;hip by a conduct, which common hone&s;ty mu&s;t teach every man to dete&s;t&mdash;Talking upon indifferent &s;ubjects in a mixed company, he would appear as chearful and &s;prightly as any in the circle; nay, I have frequently ob&s;erved him, under an affectation of mirth and humor, &s;toop to puerilities. &mdash;In the mid&s;t of &s;uch a conver&s;ation, was any one in company to drop a reli|gious hint, or make a &s;ingle grave re|mark, or did any of his very <HI>&s;erious</HI> friends enter the room, every mu&s;cle of his countenance would change its form, an awful gloom would cover his brow, his eyes and hands would be elevated, his tone of voice would become &s;olemn and plaintive, his lips would utter &s;ome pious reflection or ejaculation, and he

would attempt in a very aukward man|ner to give a &s;erious turn to the con|ver&s;ation. I &s;oon grew &s;ick of all this grimace, gradually withdrew from his acquaintance, and was afterwards in|formed by &s;everal who had been as much deceived as my&s;elf, that his tem|per and conduct was utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with his formal profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In this and two or three other in&s;tan|ces I bought my experience at no &s;mall price. The unea&s;ine&s;s of mind which I always &s;uffer on the detection of fraud or in&s;incerity in a pretended friend, is far heavier to me than any temporal lo&s;s I might thereby &s;u&s;tain.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR CHARLES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I PROMISED in my la&s;t to give you my &s;entiments upon <HI>&s;ingu|larity.</HI> The expre&s;&s;ion is ambiguous. It &s;erves to denote a good as well as a bad character. The hypocrite glories in it&mdash;The humble man alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it without offence to him&s;elf or his neighbour.</P>
<P>Some people are &s;o weak as to ima|gine, that the religious character mu&s;t
<PB N="158" REF="013258_0166_0F904BDE2B691538">
nece&s;&s;arily be accompanied with, and di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others by, a for|mal, preci&s;e and re&s;erved deportment, an au&s;terity in the countenance and acti|ons, a cautious avoiding of all inter|cour&s;e or civil communication with tho&s;e, who do not, in their whole out|ward behaviour, conform to a certain &s;tandard, which an&s;wers to their idea of a religious man.</P>
<P>Others again place this &s;ingularity in a perpetual talking upon religious &s;ubjects&mdash;Their whole conver&s;ation, be they where they will, con&s;i&s;ts of no|thing but common-place maxims, &s;crip|tural quotations, and &s;eemingly pious remarks upon every occurrence that they meet with in the cour&s;e of the day &mdash;or what is &s;till wor&s;e, of vain and u&s;e|le&s;s
<PB N="159" REF="013258_0167_0F904BDEEE753810">
di&s;putes about modes of faith, doc|trine or wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Alas! my dear Charles! all this may very properly be called the pedantry of religion, and, like that of human learn|ing, is a &s;ure proof, that their knowledge and experience are extremely &s;uper|ficial. Many of the&s;e <HI>&s;olemn triflers</HI> do we daily meet with; who value them|&s;elves upon this affected &s;ingularity, and think they &s;hew a va&s;t deal of religious heroi&s;m, by talking in a &s;train, which they know to be exceedingly mortify|ing to the generality of their neigh|bours.&mdash;But &s;uch per&s;ons as the&s;e would do well to take our Lord's advice, and &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, <HI>what manner of &s;pirit they are of</HI>&mdash;They would do well to examine their own hearts, and try, whether they cannot di&s;cover a &s;ecret &s;pring of &s;piritual pride, which &s;ets
<PB N="160" REF="013258_0168_0F904BDFABD442B8">
their tongues in motion; and whether a word or two dropt in &s;ea&s;on, &s;eeming|ly without de&s;ign, and in a &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, humility and conde&s;cen&s;ion to their brethren, would not have a much &s;urer and better effect, than all their vain and empty bablings.</P>
<P>Far be it from me, my friend, to di&s;courage a truly religious conver&s;ati|on. But there is a meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom, as the Scripture beautifully expre&s;&s;es it, that will mode&s;tly avail it&s;elf of every favourable opportunity, and with a be|coming zeal exert it&s;elf in the cau&s;e of truth.&mdash;They who be&s;t know them|&s;elves are certainly be&s;t acquainted with human nature. Such per&s;ons will ever be careful, in their conver&s;ation and deportment, to be <HI>wi&s;e as &s;erpents, and harmle&s;s as doves, to become all things to

all men,</HI> that is, to &s;tudy the various prejudices and infirmities of men, and form their di&s;cour&s;e and conduct in &s;uch a manner, as will not have any tenden|cy to di&s;gu&s;t or affront them, but on the other hand, by forbearance and gen|tlene&s;s, will win their hearts, and thus command their attention.</P>
<P>The only &s;ingularity, therefore, which is ju&s;tifiable, is that which con|&s;i&s;ts, not in words, or even in particular actions, but in &s;uch a general uniform tenor of heart and temper and conduct, as will not indeed, like the phari&s;ai|cal formalities, be &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;cerned by every vulgar eye, but will never fail of making its way at la&s;t through every ob&s;tacle and impediment, which the adver&s;aries of truth and virtue may throw up again&s;t it.</P>

that &s;tand in need of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In a word, the loveline&s;s of true religi|on appears in their whole conduct,&mdash; and even tho&s;e, who will not imitate, dare not condemn them.</P>

than by all the thundering eloquence of the mo&s;t zealous preachers in the world.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE account you &s;ent me of the popular tumults, that have for &s;ome time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in your government, differs in no material circum&s;tances from that which I have read in the pub|lic papers. I am glad to hear that you have had fortitude enough to keep your&s;elf di&s;engaged from either party. A coalition is &s;eldom brought about, without the intervention of &s;uch friends to virtue and public peace, as can con|tent them&s;elves to retire during the
<PB N="167" REF="013258_0175_0F904BE813211070">
heat of faction, watch the motions of their acquaintance or connections on both &s;ides, and &s;eize upon &s;ome happy moment, &s;ome favourable circum&s;tance for the accompli&s;hment of their bene|volent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>You &s;eem, however, to lean a little to the &s;ide of prerogative, and give &s;ome hints, that &s;ound like the language of a <HI>Jure Divino</HI> politician; and after all, very gravely a&s;k me, what are my ideas of <HI>Kingly Power,</HI> and a <HI>Patriot King?</HI> You talk of &s;criptural notions of government, and wonder what ob|jections can be made to that kind of homage and obedience, which is thereby not only warranted, but enjoined to be paid to Kings and all tho&s;e that are in|ve&s;ted with &s;upreme authority.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="013258_0176_0F904BE92780E658">My an&s;wer to your que&s;tion need not be long.&mdash;We are to con&s;ider, that the Jewi&s;h government was a Theocracy, that all its laws, in&s;titutions and ordi|nances were &s;ent down immediately from Heaven; and tho&s;e who were inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme executive power on earth, derived their authority from no o|ther &s;ource than the MOST HIGH GOD. They were delegates of Heaven, cho|&s;en Repre&s;entatives of the King of Kings, exerci&s;ing his &s;upreme authori|ty upon earth, &s;upported by his pater|nal protection, and accountable for their actions to none but him. Their con|duct was not to be &s;crutinized by the people; and to lift up the hand again&s;t the Lord's anointed was Sacrilege of the blacke&s;t nature, and to be puni&s;hed with in&s;tant death. But &s;urely all tho&s;e who are inve&s;ted with Kingly authority
<PB N="169" REF="013258_0177_0F904BE9729DD320">
are not in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, nor do they derive their power <HI>immediately</HI> from the &s;ame &s;ource with the Jewi&s;h Monarchs: and con&s;equently the peo|ple under them are not bound by the particular political precepts of the The|ocracy, but by the Laws of that par|ticular government under which they live; and the nature of their homage to their Prince can alone be determined by tho&s;e laws.</P>
<P>Indeed, in every civilized nation, however differing in their forms or con&s;titutions of government, nay even among tho&s;e where the royal preroga|tive is re&s;tricted and limited by national laws, and the people are pre&s;umed and acknowledged to be the &s;ource of pow|er, yet the Sovereign may &s;till be con|&s;idered in &s;ome re&s;pect, as the Mini&s;ter

of Heaven, and the Vice-gerent of God, as being by his Providence advanced to that exalted &s;tation. My idea of a Patriot King, therefore, founded on the&s;e &s;entiments of Kingly power, will be expre&s;&s;ed in a few words.</P>
<P>The grand de&s;ign of all human go|vernments, in whatever form they are modelled and e&s;tabli&s;hed, is the happi|ne&s;s of the people; and the end of &s;u|preme authority, however and in whom&s;oever it is inve&s;ted, is to pro|mote this happine&s;s, by the puni&s;h|ment of evil doers, and the reward or protection of tho&s;e that do well. It is highly incumbent therefore, upon all tho&s;e, whom Providence hath advanc|ed to this exalted &s;tation, to be as bold in the puni&s;hment of vice, as in the en|couragement and &s;upport of virtue.
<PB N="171" REF="013258_0179_0F904BEAEA822BF0">
Oppre&s;&s;ion will appear in many &s;hapes, and want will extend her naked arms for comfort and redre&s;s. The indigent and fatherle&s;s will be &s;uitors for their pro|tection, and tho&s;e who have no other friends on earth, will re&s;ort to them as the Proxies or Repre&s;entatives of Heaven.</P>

<P>THAT I may not be thought unmindful of my promi&s;e, or inattentive to any thing that can con|tribute to your entertainment, I here tran&s;cribe three pieces of American po|etry from manu&s;cripts, which were very obligingly communicated to me by the authors, who are by no means anxious for poetical fame, but now and then, as they expre&s;s it, &s;cribble a few lines for the amu&s;ement of them&s;elves and

their friends. The fir&s;t is an epi&s;ode extracted from a poem called <HI>The Indi|an Treaty,</HI> which is not yet fini&s;hed. The epi&s;ode is natural, tender, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed, as I think the &s;ubject requires, in common, though not vulgar lan|guage. This is a di&s;tinction, which mu&s;t ever be ob&s;erved in compo&s;itions of the <HI>pathetic</HI> kind. The <HI>&s;ublime</HI> ad|dre&s;&s;es it&s;elf to feelings of a different nature, which can only be rou&s;ed by a &s;uperior &s;trength of imagination, aided by a &s;tile that &s;oars far above that of the vulgar. The author of the epi&s;ode has attended to this di&s;tinction. He has told his tale with tenderne&s;s and &s;implicity.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;pecimen of poetry is of the elegiac kind.&mdash; I have heard that Lord Che&s;terfield &s;hould have &s;aid of
<PB N="177" REF="013258_0185_0F904BEF8BBFFAF8">
Mr. Hammond, the author of the ele|gies, that "he always &s;at down to write what he thought, not as mo&s;t authors do, to think what he &s;hould write"&mdash; I leave it to your Lord&s;hip to judge, whether the author of the elegy has any title to &s;uch a compliment as this.</P>
<P>The third &s;pecimen is of the bur|le&s;que kind; and as the &s;ubject is new, and handled in the true mock-heroic &s;train, I am per&s;uaded, it will at lea&s;t divert your Lord&s;hip for a few mo|ments.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR CHARLES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU &s;eem to hint in your la&s;t, that a &s;pirit of re&s;entment is in &s;ome ca&s;es not only allowable, but even prai&s;e-worthy; and e&s;pecially, where the cau&s;e of true Religion is attacked, or a virtuous character vilified and in&s;ult|ed. I mu&s;t differ from my friend in this, as I have ventured to do in &s;ome other of his opinions. And as an apo|logy for this difference, I mu&s;t beg his patience, whil&s;t I draw the character of a truly <HI>meek</HI> man, which I will en|deavour

to copy from the <HI>Go&s;pel Origi|nal.</HI> I will briefly con&s;ider his temper and conduct with re&s;pect to him&s;elf, his family and his neighbours.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> he well knows, that his &s;pirit is united to an earthly nature of &s;uch gro&s;s and inflam|mable &s;ub&s;tance as is ready to kindle from the &s;malle&s;t &s;park, and, if not carefully watched, would &s;oon involve the whole man in an unquenchable flame. He finds it his duty, therefore, to be perpetually upon his guard, that he may &s;mother at once every ri&s;ing &s;park, and thus pre&s;erve that coolne&s;s and compo&s;ure, which are &s;ome of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential ingredients of his happi|ne&s;s.&mdash; From whatever quarter the&s;e &s;parks may fly, whether from &s;ickne&s;s or affliction, from worldly lo&s;&s;es and

di&s;appointments, or per&s;onal injuries and affronts, his peace is equally endanger|ed.&mdash;All murmuring, peevi&s;hne&s;s and fretfulne&s;s under the former; and all wrath, bitterne&s;s and re&s;entment under the latter, if &s;uffered to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart, will inevitably rob him of his internal quiet and &s;atisfaction, and ab&s;olutely put an end to all real enjoy|ment of him&s;elf or the world in which he lives.&mdash;He knows, that by giving way to the&s;e evil pa&s;&s;ions, he &s;ubjects him&s;elf to all kinds of unea&s;ine&s;s and vexation: And ina&s;much as from fre|quent experience of his own inability to re&s;i&s;t their &s;udden and violent attacks he has learned to look up for &s;uperior and &s;upernatural aid; he, therefore, turns immediately to the redeeming power of the SON of GOD within him.
<PB N="200" REF="013258_0208_0F904B46CCE2FB10">
For he knows, that he is a GOD <HI>at hand</HI> and <HI>not afar off.</HI> Upon his Providence he &s;afely relies; to his wi&s;e di&s;po&s;als he chearfully &s;ubmits, and on his &s;pirit he depends for that &s;piritual &s;trength, which alone can a&s;&s;i&s;t and deliver him in every conflict of nature.</P>
<P>The &s;ame gentlene&s;s, patience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion manife&s;t them&s;elves in his whole behaviour and deportment to|wards the little <HI>family</HI> circle, with which he is happily &s;urrounded.

God is a God of order and love. Where-ever the&s;e are violated even in the minute&s;t in&s;tances, there is a breach of his eternal law; and at this breach the powers of darkne&s;s will ever be ready to enter, and ob&s;cure and per|plex and confound the minds of tho&s;e who have made it. He is not, there|fore, as the Wi&s;e-Man expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>like a lion in his hou&s;e, or frantic among his children or his &s;ervants;</HI> but he governs his little flock with prudence and meek|ne&s;s, and endeavours to introduce Hea|ven into their hearts, and to make them an <HI>Hou&s;hold</HI> of GOD, a family of love.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="013258_0210_0F904B4836B23280">With re&s;pect to his <HI>neighbours,</HI> he is particularly careful to keep his mind, under the influences of <HI>Divine Grace,</HI> in &s;uch a frame as neither to give nor take offence, neither to provoke <HI>them</HI> by any actions of <HI>his,</HI> nor &s;uffer <HI>him&s;elf</HI> to be kindled into wrath or re&s;entment by any actions of <HI>theirs.</HI> He knows, that con|&s;i&s;tent with all this meekne&s;s and &s;weet|ne&s;s of temper, he may and ought to maintain and defend his ju&s;t rights, and never give them up, but at the de|mands of peace or charity, or &s;ome bet|ter claim than mere unkindne&s;s, envy or ill-nature can &s;et up. As to per&s;on|al injuries and ill-treatment, he knows that the wor&s;t of the&s;e cannot hurt him. So far from re&s;enting, he for|gives them from the bottom of his heart.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR and REV. SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS not a little &s;urprized the other day when we dined together at the honourable and worthy Mr. H&mdash;'s, to hear you launch forth in|to &s;uch high encomiums upon the cha|racter and writings of Mr STERNE. Unwilling to interrupt the chearfulne&s;s of the company by introducing any thing that might have the appearance of a &s;erious di&s;pute, I only rallied you a little upon your attachment to this de&s;ultory writer, and reminded you of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, the gro&s;s indelicacy
<PB N="208" REF="013258_0216_0F904B4D6A948EF8">
of which is &s;carcely covered by the &s;lim&s;y gauze of his fine expre&s;&s;ion. You replied to me by quoting &s;ome of tho&s;e tender and pathetic &s;trokes, which we meet with here and there through|out his volumes, which be&s;peak, as you &s;aid, a truly benevolent and &s;ympathetic heart, and more than atone for all the indelicate &s;lips of his pen.</P>
<P>I admire tho&s;e &s;trokes as much as you do: But &s;till I am not quite &s;a|tisfied, that the feelings he de&s;cribes are any thing more than tho&s;e we have in common with the brute creation, at lea&s;t that there is any thing heavenly in them, 'till they come to be placed under the direction of an heavenly power, and act in &s;ub&s;erviency to its inward dic|tates; otherwi&s;e, pa&s;&s;ion may get the name of virtue, and a finely attempered

frame become the only Heaven we would wi&s;h for.</P>
<P>Suffer me, then, to <HI>preach</HI> a little to the <HI>preacher,</HI> and give you my &s;enti|ments upon true <HI>&s;ympathy</HI> or <HI>tenderne&s;s of heart.</HI></P>
<P>We mi&s;take the matter exceedingly, my friend, if we imagine, that true <HI>tenderne&s;s of heart</HI> is no other than that <HI>animal &s;ympathy,</HI> if I may &s;o call it, which is common to wicked as well as good men, nay, which even the brute crea|tion &s;eem to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in a very con&s;iderable degree. That mixture of good and evil, which is very ob&s;erva|ble in the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of things, fre|quently produces &s;ome very lovely and delightful appearances and effects.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="013258_0218_0F904B4FC9B37988">When we walk into our gardens, we find our &s;en&s;es mo&s;t agreeably refre&s;hed by the beauty, fragrance or ta&s;te of the various kinds of herbage, fruits or flow|ers, that &s;pring forth from the common &s;oil. We feel the meekne&s;s of Heaven it&s;elf in the calmne&s;s and &s;erenity of a morning or evening &s;ky. We are de|lighted with the &s;weet &s;ollicitude, which birds and bea&s;ts te&s;tify for their mates as well as their offspring. And we can|not but admire the fond attachment, the &s;eeming friend&s;hip and gratitude, which &s;ome of the more &s;agacious among them frequently &s;hew to man.</P>
<P>But as all the&s;e plea&s;ing wonders of the animate as well as inanimate &s;y&s;tem are no other than the productions or births of this temporary world, &s;o they partake of all the changes and di&s;or|ders
<PB N="211" REF="013258_0219_0F904B50955EB400">
to which it is continually expo&s;ed. They are born, and grow, and bloom, and come to their perfection&mdash;and then fade, and wither, and die, and di&s;&s;olve into the original elements, out of which they &s;prung.</P>
<P>Man, con&s;idered merely with re&s;pect to his body, is no more than <HI>a joint te|nant of the &s;hade</HI> with the bea&s;ts of the field. The &s;ame in&s;tincts, the &s;ame appetites and pa&s;&s;ions reign in his earth|ly part. Like them he is &s;ubject to the changes of the elements. Like them he is born, and grows, and comes to maturity &mdash;and then gradually de|clines, and dies, and &s;inks into one common grave with them.</P>
<P>But then he has within him a &s;park of immorality, a birth of heaven, a ray
<PB N="212" REF="013258_0220_0F904B5157BF1230">
of the divinity, which, tho' impri&s;oned in a tenement of clay, can and will, if permitted, look beyond its narrow cir|cumference into that eternal world, out of which it came. By its &s;piritual in|tercour&s;e with the great father of &s;pi|rits it is enabled to compare temporal things with &s;piritual, and form &s;uch a true and accurate e&s;timate, founded upon its own experience and &s;en&s;ibili|ties, as will always point out that &s;u|periority, which the heavenly part with its heavenly de&s;ires &s;hould maintain over the earthly part with its earthly in&s;tincts and appetites. But perhaps it may be nece&s;&s;ary to expre&s;s this &s;enti|ment in clearer and more explicit terms.</P>
<P>There is certainly, among&s;t men, &s;omething like what I have heard called <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> virtue, that is to &s;ay, a
<PB N="132" REF="013258_0221_0F904B52BB04B420">
virtue, that takes its ri&s;e from, and depends upon a man's particular make or con&s;titution, the &s;tate of his blood or nerves.</P>
<P>Thus you will find among&s;t a num|ber of children of the &s;ame family <HI>one,</HI> that from his very cradle &s;eems to be bold and intrepid, fearle&s;s of danger, eager and enterprizing; <HI>another,</HI> timid, irre&s;olute, ea&s;ily ca&s;t down or affright|ed&mdash;<HI>one,</HI> haughty, vain, forward and impertinent,&mdash;<HI>another,</HI> meek, humble, diffident and mode&s;t&mdash;<HI>one,</HI> that &s;eems to be a &s;tranger to pity, tenderne&s;s and love&mdash;<HI>another,</HI> melting into tears at the pro&s;pect, or even recital of the lea&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>That this variety of tempers and di&s;|po&s;itions depends not upon education is
<PB N="214" REF="013258_0222_0F904B538CD7DB68">
&s;ufficiently obvious. For children of the &s;ame family are generally treated in the &s;ame manner, and &s;imilar advice and in|&s;tructions are given to all. Now, 'tis very remarkable, that the &s;ame variety of di&s;|po&s;itions &s;hews it&s;elf equally con&s;picu|ous in the brute creation. Hence we may rea&s;onably conclude, that in men as well as brutes they &s;pring forth from that mixture of good and evil, which characterizes every object of temporal nature.</P>
<Q><P>Aye, &s;ays the infidel: This is all very true&mdash;we are &s;o born &mdash;we are &s;o con&s;tituted&mdash;and therefore our vices and our virtues are alike ne|ce&s;&s;ary and unavoidable. Talk no more, then, of your di&s;tinctions be|twixt right and wrong&mdash;our tempers depend upon the con&s;titution of our
<PB N="215" REF="013258_0223_0F904B544D4166F0">
bodies&mdash;and vice and virtue are but empty names.</P>
<P>A per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s &s;olicits my charity&mdash;if I am a good-natured man, as 'tis called, or if the applica|tion is made to me, when I am in a good humour, I mo&s;t chearfully ad|mini&s;ter relief&mdash;But if I am of a &s;our temper, or am called upon at an unfavourable &s;ea&s;on, I turn my back upon the object, and di&s;mi&s;s him with wrath.</P>
<P>I ri&s;e in the morning in an exceed|ing good humour, plea&s;ed and de|lighted with my&s;elf and every body about me&mdash;I am happy and chearful in my family&mdash;I walk abroad, and &s;alute every friend that meets me with a &s;mile. Within an hour or two,
<PB N="216" REF="013258_0224_0F904B551555BF08">
all my feelings are changed. Some di&s;|agreeable piece of intelligence rela|tive to my&s;elf&mdash;&s;ome &s;light &s;hewn me by an acquaintance&mdash;&s;ome little di&s;|appointment in my worldly intere&s;ts &mdash;or perhaps, a little cold that I have caught&mdash;the&s;e, or any other trifling accidents are &s;ufficient to oppre&s;s my &s;pirits, di&s;compo&s;e my temper, and make me feel di&s;&s;atisfied with my|&s;elf, and every body about me. All my affection, my tenderne&s;s and love are gone: And whil&s;t I remain in this &s;ituation, I am indifferent alike ;to virtue and vice.</P>
<P>Now then, continues the exult|ing infidel, where is your religion? Where is your morality? Where is your go&s;pel illumination?&mdash;All is vi&s;ionary&mdash;'tis the &s;tate of your blood,
<PB N="217" REF="013258_0225_0F904B55B3108A50">
or the &s;tate of your nerves, that con|&s;titutes your virtue or your vice. On the&s;e alone they depend for their tran&s;itory exi&s;tence. With the&s;e they decay&mdash;with the&s;e they die.&mdash;</P></Q>
<P>But tell me, thou poor purblind mor|tal! Amid all the&s;e changes and vi|ci&s;&s;itudes, that attend thy bodily frame, what is it <HI>within thee,</HI> that thinks, and rea&s;ons, and reflects, and ob&s;erves up|on every change that pa&s;&s;es&mdash;and con|tinues to do &s;o, let thy body be affect|ed as it may! What is it that renders thee &s;ecretly di&s;&s;atisfied, after thou ha&s;t amu&s;ed thy&s;elf with all the&s;e fine &s;pecu|lations? What is it that tells thee, that &s;uch and &s;uch things are good and right and proper to be done, and that &s;uch and &s;uch are wrong, evil in their nature and leading to mi&s;ery&mdash;and tells thee &s;o,

<P>Could&s;t thou read aright the volume that is unfolded in thine heart, thou would&s;t find there the &s;ame language, which thy Saviour &s;peaks in his go&s;pel, viz: That THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN THEE; that virtue, goodne&s;s, holine&s;s, are not empty names, but that they are a real nature, of heavenly extrac|tion; that they depend not merely up|on our animal &s;en&s;ations, but may be called forth, and brought into exer|ci&s;e, independent of, and &s;uperior to them;&mdash;that this heavenly nature will regulate, controul and direct the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ions or appetites of thine earthly part;&mdash;that, whether thy temper be

gentle or violent, meek or wrathful, kind and tender, of &s;our and moro&s;e, this ble&s;&s;ed principle, if attended to and obeyed, will make both its good and its evil turn to thine advantage: It will overcome all that is har&s;h, peevi&s;h and di&s;contented within thee; and will give an heavenly tincture, virtue and effica|cy to thine earthly meekne&s;s, tender|ne&s;s and love. It will teach thee to look above nature, above in&s;tinct, above rea&s;on, for that which is to &s;et nature, in&s;tinct, rea&s;on, right.

earth and heaven, betwixt our fallen &s;pirits, and his own &s;pirit of love.</P>
<P>From the&s;e few ob&s;ervations, for which I beg your candid attention and indulgence, I think you cannot but conclude with me, that virtue, good|ne&s;s or holine&s;s do not con&s;i&s;t in a mere external decency of behaviour; that they do not con&s;i&s;t in, nor are they re|gulated merely by our bodily feelings; but that they are the gifts of God in Chri&s;t, and to be received by the &s;pirit of prayer in our hearts.</P>
<P>Were we once, my good friend, con|vinced of this, we &s;hould not wait for the mere &s;ympathy of animal nature to prompt us to benevolent deeds. We &s;hould be kind and tender from a &s;u|perior principle&mdash;we &s;hould find our|&s;elves

willing to an&s;wer the calls of this principle, even again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t re|luctances of our earthly part.

<P>After all, do not think, Sir, I have been declaiming wholly again&s;t animal &s;ympathies&mdash;They have their u&s;es, great u&s;es too&mdash;but then let them not be &s;up|po&s;ed to extend and operate beyond their native &s;phere&mdash;They belong to earth&mdash;they dwell in the earthly part of our frame&mdash;If we place them indeed un|der the guidance of Heaven, they will partake of the virtue of Angels&mdash;other|wi&s;e they will be no more in the &s;ight of

heaven, than the meekne&s;s of the lamb, or the tenderne&s;s of the turtle-dove.</P>
<P>Receive it then, as a maxim, abun|dantly confirmed by the experience of all mankind, that outward emotion is by no means an infallible &s;ign of inward <HI>charity;</HI> but that <HI>tenderne&s;s</HI> may often ap|pear in the eye, whil&s;t <HI>avarice,</HI> or &s;ome other infernal pa&s;&s;ion, keeps the door of the heart.</P>

I am perfectly convinced with you, that we &s;hould behold a very different ap|pearance in human &s;ociety, were all its members attentive to the common offi|ces of kindne&s;s towards each other&mdash; were all mean and illiberal attachments to &s;elf-intere&s;t bani&s;hed from their

<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this, &s;o &s;en&s;ible are men of the peculiar charm and gracefulne&s;s of a kind behaviour, that they endeavour to put on its external form, and appear to others, what they know in their own con&s;ciences they are not in them&s;elves. Hence the many ci|vil, obliging, humble and conde&s;cend|ing modes of &s;peech, which are in fa|&s;hion among tho&s;e at lea&s;t who have had a polite education. A &s;tranger to the&s;e forms, and one who was actuated &s;olely by the feelings of his own heart, would be very apt to form a favourable judgment of the hearts of tho&s;e, who&s;e outward behaviour exhibits &s;uch a &s;tri|king appearance of humility and bene|volence.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR CHARLES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all you have &s;aid, I mu&s;t &s;till main|tain my fir&s;t po&s;ition, that every rela|tion, &s;tate and employment of human life may be rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to the purpo&s;es of piety and goodne&s;s.&mdash;'Tis not the outward circum&s;tances by which we are affected, but the inward &s;pirit and temper of mind, by which we live and act under them.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity, indeed, &s;tands in direct oppo&s;ition to the &s;pirit
<PB N="230" REF="013258_0238_0F904B610991A560">
of this world. Its views and pro&s;pects, its hopes and de&s;ires all re&s;pect another world. Lodged within this tenement of clay lives an eternal &s;pirit, to who&s;e boundle&s;s de&s;ires no earthly objects can po&s;&s;ibly be commen&s;urate. Its pre&s;ent &s;ituation expo&s;es it to a variety of delu|&s;ions; and the fallen nature to which it is in bondage, perplexes it with a varie|ty of contending wills, each &s;eeking to obtain its favourite object. But when once this eternal &s;pirit is brought to a conviction of the emptine&s;s and vanity of all creaturely enjoyments; when once it is brought to &s;ee and feel its own illu&s;trious origin, and to know, that its real happine&s;s can only be de|rived from the great fountain-&s;pirit out of which it had its Divine Birth&mdash; then the power of &s;piritual attraction immediately commences. Through a

thou&s;and intervening ob&s;tructions it &s;eeks, and will &s;eek its true center; and every outward earthly &s;ituation, which it may be in, is, by virtue of its hea|venly de&s;ires, made to contribute to the ha&s;tening and fulfilling of this ble&s;&s;ed union.</P>
<P>The &s;eeming interruptions which a good man daily meets with from the calls of nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s and temporal employment, are no real impediment to his &s;piritual progre&s;s. He is careful to engage no further in any intercou&s;e or connection with worldly men or worldly things, than he finds nece&s;&s;ary for the fulfilling tho&s;e private or pub|lic duties to which his &s;ituation in this world and the common calls of huma|nity and benevolence do continually

&s;ubject him. Such a kind of &s;ocial in|tercour&s;e, as calls forth the&s;e amiable virtues into con&s;tant exerci&s;e, he finds as nece&s;&s;ary to his &s;piritual life, as medita|tion and prayer.</P>
<P>There are a thou&s;and little offices of civility, kindne&s;s and re&s;pect, to be performed every day in our intercour&s;e with each other, which, (if we would attend to them) would &s;hew our true &s;tate of mind, temper and di&s;po&s;ition, much more &s;atisfactorily than tho&s;e more glaring and &s;hewy performances, of which we are apt to form too favour|able a judgment. A thou&s;and name|le&s;s &s;en&s;ibilities are hereby opened in our brea&s;ts, which &s;erve to advance us in our virtuous progre&s;s, either by ex|citing an humble &s;en&s;e of our own weakne&s;s, or an affectionate exertion of our &s;ympathy and love.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="013258_0241_0F904B632B2F4470">Be not di&s;&s;atisfied, therefore, my va|luable friend, with your pre&s;ent employ|ment. Do not throw it up in a fit of melancholy.

<P><Q>THE world is full of tempt|ations,</Q> replies my dear CHARLES&mdash; <Q>the multitude are always in the wrong&mdash;always walking in the <HI>broad way that leadeth to de&s;truction.</HI> Retirement is certainly the &s;afe&s;t &s;tate for me.

My &s;oul mu&s;t &s;uffer, whil&s;t matters, merely temporal ne|ce&s;&s;arily

engro&s;s &s;o much of my time and attention. If I could but get into the country, and have nothing to mind but a little farm, and &s;ome &s;uch innocent employments as belong to a rural life, my &s;oul and body both would be much better for the change.</Q></P>
<P>Thinke&s;t thou &s;o, my good friend? I remember to have heard or read, that one of the primitive fathers (I think it was ST. BASIL) was for a while of the &s;ame opinion. Attacked by many vi|olent temptations from within and from without, whil&s;t he led a &s;ecular life, he was &s;ure that he &s;hould get him&s;elf quite di&s;engaged from all, by burying him&s;elf in &s;ome ob&s;cure place of retire|ment. The &s;ilent cell of the gloomy anchorite exactly corre&s;ponded with
<PB N="236" REF="013258_0244_0F904B668390A4B8">
the idea he had formed. He flattered him&s;elf that all would be peace and &s;ere|nity there, and that his thoughts would be wholly taken up with God and hea|venly things. But experience &s;oon taught him otherwi&s;e. Though he had turned his back as he thought upon the world and worldly objects and their &s;o|licitations, he found he could not &s;o ea|&s;ily turn his back upon the Devil and his own evil heart, which &s;till followed him, took up their abode with him, and per&s;ecuted him even in his lonely cell.</P>
<P>The Emperor CHARLES THE FIFTH, after a mo&s;t rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of con|que&s;ts, &s;uddenly abdicated the Crown in a fit of di&s;&s;atisfaction, and &s;ought relief from worldly cares and di&s;qui|etudes in the &s;ilence and ob&s;curity of
<PB N="237" REF="013258_0245_0F904B673A55A3B8">
worldly &s;olitude. And yet if we may depend upon what is related by a very eminent writer, his worldly cares &s;oon followed him into his rural rece&s;s, and his thoughts were almo&s;t wholly taken up with the political and military con|duct of a &s;on, by whom he was &s;o &s;hamefully neglected, that the &s;canty pittance, which he had re&s;erved for his &s;upport, was not paid him without grudging and irregularity.</P>
<P>Now, if in&s;tead of abdicating his Crown, this mighty Monarch had ab|dicated his worldly &s;pirit, his proud, ambitious, covetous temper and di&s;po|&s;ition; if he had applied to the KING OF KINGS for that true &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and government, which would have rendered him the happy father of his

happy &s;ubjects, and changed his tem|poral into &s;piritual triumphs; he might &s;till have retained his royalty, and would certainly have found that peace and tranquillity upon a Throne which he fought for in vain in the &s;olitude of ST. JUSTUS.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Dialogues des Morts, par <HI>M. FENELON.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The poor man thinks, that, if he was rich, or had but what he calls a compe|tency, he would devote all his time to the &s;alvation of his &s;oul. The rich man complains of being obliged to live ac|cording to his character and circum|&s;tances, and that in con&s;equence of this is &s;o over-done with company, vi&s;its and entertainments, that he has little or no time to him&s;elf. He thinks, that the poor man, as he is not capable of enter|ing
<PB N="239" REF="013258_0247_0F904B6A09DF34D8">
into the fa&s;hionable modes of life, can have nothing to do but to mind his work and &s;ay his prayers.</P>
<P>Phy&s;icians, Lawyers, Divines, Mer|chants, Mechanicks, young and old, all complain of &s;omething or another in their peculiar calling, occupation or time of life, which they &s;ay hinders them from being as religious as they de&s;ire to be. But they are certainly under a great de|lu&s;ion. Nay, 'tis to be feared, they willingly deceive them&s;elves. They very well know, they have time enough and to &s;pare, if they would employ it properly. There is not a man in the whole world, let his age, &s;tation, cha|racter or religion be what it will, but may <HI>abide in his calling,</HI> and &s;erve God and take care of his own &s;oul as effectual|ly, as if he was in any other &s;ituation of
<PB N="240" REF="013258_0248_0F904B6BF28E2B50">
life. For 'tis a man's own fault, if he &s;uffers him&s;elf to be too much entan|gled in any worldly employment.</P>
<P>Providence brings our duties to our very doors; and every day of our life furni&s;hes &s;uch occurrences in our own particular way, as, if properly improv|ed, are &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy others as well as our&s;elves, what manner of &s;pirit we are of; whether we are &s;till acting un|der the influence of our fallen and cor|rupted nature, or whether we &s;uffer our heavenly nature to be called forth into life by the HOLY JESUS, and to do his ble&s;&s;ed work.</P>
<P>This will be the la&s;t letter I &s;hall have it in my power to write to you for &s;ome time. I have engaged in an af|fair, that will probably call me to Eng|land
