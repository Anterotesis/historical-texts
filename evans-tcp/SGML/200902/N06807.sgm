<P>The King &s;hall joy in thy &s;trength, O Lord, and in thy &s;alvation how greatly &s;hall he rejoice. Thou ha&s;t given him his heart's de&s;ire, and ha&s;t not with|holden the reque&s;t of his lips. For thou prevente&s;t him with the ble&s;&s;ings of goodne&s;s; thou &s;ette&s;t a crown of pure gold upon his head. He a&s;ked life of thee, and thou gave&s;t it him, even length of days for ever and ever.&mdash;Thine hand &s;hall find out all thine enemies, thy right hand &s;hall find out tho&s;e that hate thee.&mdash;For they intended evil again&s;t thee: they imagined a mi&s;chievous device, which they were not able to perform. Therefore &s;hall thou make them turn their back, when thou &s;halt make ready thine arrows upon thy &s;trings, again&s;t the face of them. Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own &s;trength: &s;o will we &s;ing and prai&s;e thy power.</P></Q>

<P>IT is probable <HI>David</HI> wrote this divine ode &s;oon after he had received that promi&s;e of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of his kingdom in an uninterrupted line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion thro' his &s;on <HI>Solomon,</HI> which we find, 1 <HI>Chronicles,</HI> 17^t^h Chapter.</P>
<P>On this promi&s;e <HI>David</HI> there dwells with admi|ration and rapture: it is plainly the &s;ubject of &s;everal p&s;alms; and he doubtle&s;s under&s;tood it as of the &s;ame tenor with the promi&s;es made to <HI>Abra|ham</HI> and the <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> ultimately referring to the
<PB N="6" REF="008632_0004_102FA2ADF2537BE0">
kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah. This he &s;eems principally to keep in view in this p&s;alm; in a prophetic man|ner he de&s;cants upon it, and rejoices not only in the highe&s;t a&s;&s;urance of his own continued victories, and the greater glory of his &s;on <HI>Solomon,</HI> but of the irre|&s;i&s;tible power of that future royal &s;on again&s;t whom no policy &s;hould prevail, no weapon pro&s;per.</P>
<P>But as far as this p&s;alm relates to him&s;elf, he de|voutly expre&s;&s;es his intire dependance upon God, a&s;cribes all his &s;trength, &s;afety, honor, and pro&s;perity to him, acknowleges them as an&s;wers to his continu|al prayers, and thankfully reflects upon divine good|ne&s;s in prolonging his reign, and granting him the hope of an endle&s;s life: by the great things which God had already done for him, and a believing pro&s;|pect of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom, he ri&s;es to the mo&s;t joyful confidence that God would &s;till continue his favours to I&s;rael con&s;idered as his church, and di&s;|appoint and confound all their enemies; and &s;o he concludes with this exulting prayer of faith, which he puts into the mouths of the whole body of &s;aints <HI>&mdash;Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own &s;trength: &s;o will we &s;ing and prai&s;e thy power.</HI> q. d. Lord ma|nife&s;t thy divine perfections more and more, make thy power con&s;picuous in thy wonderful providences for the &s;afety and pro&s;perity of thy church; let all nations behold thy maje&s;ty and univer&s;al dominion: &s;o will thy people &s;ing of thy goodne&s;s, and celebrate thy prai&s;e. Let us on the pre&s;ent joyful occa&s;ion &s;ubjoin our hearty AMEN.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. The &s;trength, &s;afety, grandeur, and pro&s;perity of kings, e&s;pecially when in connexion with the &s;ecurity and welfare of the church, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to God.</P>
<P>All things are of God: the exi&s;tence, order, beauty of univer&s;al nature, &s;prung from his almigh|ty word, according to that perfect plan of eternal wi&s;dom, by which all things appear'd di&s;tinctly in their mo&s;t minute circum&s;tances to an infinite mind, when yet <HI>they were not:</HI> the con&s;tant laws of mate|rial &s;y&s;tems were fix'd from the beginning, and con|tinue by his will: and all intellectual and rational beings are equally under the mo&s;t exact regulation, by that &s;upreme moral government which he more immediately exerci&s;es as <HI>God over all,</HI> and by the con&s;titutions which he has &s;ettled agreeable to their various ranks and circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>All government originates from him who is the Creator and Lord of the univer&s;e; who has plainly pointed out, by the different genius and capacities of
<PB REF="008632_0006_102FA2B291299DA0">
men, various &s;ervices, and different degrees of honor and power; who has made &s;ociety nece&s;&s;ary for our welfare and comfort; who led the fir&s;t families and tribes of mankind, by a certain in&s;tinct of nature, to acknowlege and obey their re&s;pective heads, and con&s;ent to that authority which each found nece&s;&s;ary for their common &s;afety.</P>
<P>Government began in patriarchal authority, and was gradually improved into more ample power, and exten&s;ive dominion, e&s;tabli&s;h'd upon new claims, according to the ri&s;ing exigencies of tho&s;e little com|munities, and the opportunities which artful ambi|tious men &s;eized upon from time to time to aggran|dize them&s;elves, and &s;ubject cities and kingdoms to their will. There is &s;omething in the very con&s;ti|tution of man, and the general condition of the in|habitants of the earth, which tends to divide the world into di&s;tinct nations, and produce the various forms and degrees of dominion which have appear'd in all ages. Thus <HI>the civil powers are ordained of God,</HI> de&s;igned originally for the benefit of mankind, erected in various forms by his &s;pecial providence.</P>
<P>We no where find any certain model of govern|ment, pre&s;cribed by expre&s;s revelation, except that given to I&s;rael under <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> which was peculiar to their circum&s;tances as a national church, a proper theocracy under the conduct of a peculiar provi|dence. <HI>The divine right of kings,</HI> as it has been preach'd up in times pa&s;t in order to &s;upport tyranny, and per&s;uade people to bear the heavie&s;t yoke with tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, is a whim&s;y without any foundation in &s;cripture or rea&s;on: <HI>pa&s;&s;ive obedience</HI> is a doctrine which none can &s;wallow who under&s;tand the natu|ral rights of mankind; which prote&s;tants e&s;pecially
<PB N="9" REF="008632_0007_102FA2B7201AFA98">
mu&s;t abhor; which <HI>England</HI> has always rejected as incon&s;i&s;tent with all her liberties: had this maxim prevailed, the great revolution by which <HI>Great-Bri|tain</HI> was happily &s;ecured from popi&s;h kings and pre|tenders had never been effected, and long before this time we might have been reduced under &s;ub|jection to <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' we deny an <HI>indefea&s;ible divine right,</HI> we acknowlege kings are &s;et up by the providence of God. The famous antient monarchies of the world were erected according to his purpo&s;e, and ro&s;e to the height of their grandeur by his permi&s;&s;ion. Even tyrants who abu&s;e their power, are exalted by the hand of God, to be in&s;truments of cha&s;ti&s;ing the nations for their &s;ins; he rai&s;es them up, or ca&s;ts them down, lets loo&s;e their rage or re&s;trains them, at his plea&s;ure. The A&s;&s;yrian monarch <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. x. 5&mdash;15.</NOTE> was but <HI>the rod of divine anger; the indignation of God put the &s;taff in his hand; he was &s;ent by heaven again&s;t an hypocritical nation, to take the &s;poil, to take the prey;</HI> tho' the tyrant never imagined any &s;uch thing, but only <HI>aim'd to de&s;troy and cut off nations not a few.</HI> So the Mo&s;t High gave Nebuchadnezzar <HI>his kingdom and maje&s;ty and glory and honour,</HI> and bro't all people into &s;ubjection to him, to an&s;wer his own wi&s;e and and holy purpo&s;es. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dan. v. 18, 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>But when &s;uch an equitable con&s;titution of go|vernment is form'd and &s;ettled as is plainly agreeable to the laws of nature, in the be&s;t manner &s;erving the ends of &s;ociety; when the plain de&s;ign and tenden|cy of it is to &s;ecure life, liberty and property, and promote virtue and peace; e&s;pecially when it not only guards and enforces the religion of nature, but gives protection and encouragement to the church
<PB N="10" REF="008632_0008_102FA2BB0BE50B40">
of God, built upon the more immediate revelation of his will; &s;uch a government may be &s;aid with peculiar empha&s;is to be <HI>of God:</HI> &s;uch a kingdom is conformable to the perfect pattern of his &s;upreme dominion, and the King of Heaven mu&s;t be plea&s;ed with it in the &s;ame manner as he takes complacency in the virtues of individuals, and every thing copied from his own perfections.</P>
<P>By the church we are not to under&s;tand &s;ome one di&s;tinct form and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment of religious &s;ociety;</HI> but collectively the whole body of chri&s;tians, united, tho' in many di&s;tinct &s;ocieties, under various particular denominations, in the wor&s;hip of the one true God according to the expre&s;s revelation of his will. Nor is the church &s;o connected in its own nature with the power and pro&s;perity of any particular govern|ment, that it cannot &s;tand upon its own proper ba&s;is without the &s;upport of civil authority: for we know the chri&s;tian church flouri&s;h'd and &s;pread, in its great|e&s;t purity and power, long before it had the counte|nance of emperors and kings. Civil and religious &s;ocieties are entirely di&s;tinct in their nature; the or|der and proper authority of the one cannot be blend|ed with the order and proper authority of the other, without the greate&s;t hazard of corrupting and weak|ening both.</P>
<P>Yet the church receives great advantage from a well con&s;tituted civil government, and the pro&s;perity of the &s;tate. Under &s;uch a happy government it is guarded again&s;t the rage of per&s;ecution; appears openly in the wor&s;hip and order of religious a&s;&s;em|blies; enjoys the benefit of public in&s;truction, free inquiry, and undi&s;&s;embled profe&s;&s;ion; is permitted to employ all the artillery of the <HI>word of God</HI> again&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="008632_0009_102FA2BC98AC21B0">
the devil's kingdom, and u&s;e the be&s;t means for its own inlargement and perfection. The church thus built on its proper foundation, mu&s;t very much de|pend on the &s;afety and pro&s;perity of the kingdom, for it's own &s;ecurity and welfare: if the nation is weakened by wars, or over-run by inva&s;ions, the enemies of the one will probably be enemies to the other, and the church mu&s;t have a great &s;hare in the public calamities; but when the nation grows &s;tronger, and not only maintains its ground but multiplies its conque&s;ts, and becomes great and for|midable, religion &s;tands more &s;ecure, and &s;preads knowlege and liberty farther and farther.</P>
<P>A kingdom e&s;tabli&s;hed upon &s;uch equitable prin|ciples, where civil liberty and evangelical religion are encouraged and &s;upported, &s;tands fair for the pe|culiar guardian&s;hip of Heaven. As the hand of God may be &s;een in erecting, his providence will be ob&s;ervable in defending and aggrandizing it: he will make its kings great and honorable by his &s;pe|cial favor, and grant them <HI>his &s;trength and &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>When good kings are rais'd up, who by their example and authority encourage piety and virtue, and rule in the fear of God, they are like <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon,</HI> dignified and protected by a peculiar providence, and given as ble&s;&s;ings to their people and the church of God: and he will make them great on the throne, and &s;ucce&s;sful in war; they will reign in the hearts of their &s;ubjects, and be fear'd and honor'd by neighbouring nations. The goodne&s;s and power of God will be as plainly vi&s;ible in their ad|vancement, and the pro&s;perity which attends their reign, as if they had been cho&s;en and appointed by him in the mo&s;t immediate extraordinary manner,
<PB N="12" REF="008632_0010_102FA2BE21F1AE98">
and gain'd their glory and magnificence in con&s;e|quence of the mo&s;t expre&s;s per&s;onal promi&s;es: and the people ought to have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of this divine goodne&s;s, and e&s;teem it a great ble&s;&s;ing to have the life and reign of &s;uch kings prolonged.</P>
<P>This naturally brings on the next remark,</P>
<P N="2">II. The long life and pro&s;perous reign of a good king is a great ble&s;&s;ing, and an encouragement to the people of God to depend upon his continued care of the church, and the farther accompli&s;hment of his promi&s;es.</P>
<P>Fooli&s;h, irreligious, an vicious princes are often &s;ent in wrath to a people, as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment of their &s;ins: when they have for&s;aken God and cor|rupted them&s;elves, he &s;uffers them to be corrupted more and more by the example of their kings, per|mits their vices according to their natural tendency to infect and weaken the government, di&s;tract their councils, impoveri&s;h and lay them open to the power of their enemies; and &s;ends his cur&s;e upon them in all their intere&s;ts and undertakings. By a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of wicked kings I&s;rael was &s;oon ripened for utter ruin; and the favor or di&s;plea&s;ure of God toward Judah was apparent according to the character of the kings which from time to time reigned over them: nor &s;hould we be mi&s;taken perhaps in mak|ing the &s;ame remarks upon the hi&s;tory of our <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> monarchs.</P>
<P>Not that irreligious princes are never us'd by pro|vidence as in&s;truments of doing &s;ome real good to a nation: to a&s;&s;ert this would be to limit the wi&s;|dom and power of God, in contradiction to &s;crip|ture and experience. He can make advantage even
<PB N="13" REF="008632_0011_102FA2C50B1A8B68">
of the vices of the great, their pride, ambition, re|venge, avarice, or lu&s;t, to accompli&s;h his de&s;igns for the good of a favorite nation, and the welfare of his church. <HI>Saul</HI> was a &s;elf-will'd, jealous, revengeful prince; yet he introduced order among a people who had lived for centuries too much at loo&s;e from government; he perform'd &s;everal worthy actions, and laid a good foundation for a pro&s;perous king|dom. <HI>Jehu</HI>'s zeal was fir'd chiefly by ambition; yet he did the work which God commanded, in cutting off the hou&s;e of <HI>Ahab,</HI> and de&s;troying the wor&s;hippers of <HI>Baal.</HI> The grand charter of <HI>Eng|land</HI>'s liberties was obtain'd of kings far from the be&s;t of characters. And a monarch who&s;e chief aim was to gratify his lu&s;t, became the in&s;trument of our deliverance from the pope's tyranny, and the intro|duction of the mo&s;t valuable ble&s;&s;ings of the refor|mation.</P>
<P>But wi&s;e and virtuous kings, who&s;e brea&s;ts glow with all &s;ocial affections; who are equally ennobled by great and generous actions as by royal blood; who value their high authority only as a power of doing the greate&s;t good; merit the warme&s;t love of their &s;ubjects, and will be honor'd as fathers and benefactors, ble&s;&s;ings which Heaven gives and con|tinues. Such amiable princes have appear'd even among the heathen, the delight of their people, the &s;trength and glory of their kingdoms. Such was <HI>Cyrus,</HI> the founder of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> monarchy, <HI>Ju|dah</HI>'s great deliverer from the captivity of <HI>Babylon,</HI> who&s;e name &s;tood honorably regi&s;ter'd in one of the mo&s;t remarkable prophecies of <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> near two hundred years before the event <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. xlv.</NOTE>. Such among the <HI>Roman</HI> emperors was <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> who&s;e reign was
<PB N="14" REF="008632_0012_102FA2C694E6B540">
gloriou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the birth of our Lord and Savior Je&s;us Chri&s;t within the limits of his empire: and after him, <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian, Antoninus, Pius</HI> and &s;ome others.</P>
<P>But e&s;pecially when kings are men of true reli|gion, fearing and giving glory to God; it is a ma|nife&s;t token of the divine pre&s;ence with them,&mdash;a plain intimation that God de&s;igns the greate&s;t favors to &s;uch a nation. The be&s;t of Kings will be im|ploy'd in the mo&s;t eminent &s;ervices, and di&s;tingui&s;h'd by providence with the greate&s;t honors. If ever we may depend upon remarkable public pro&s;perity, it is under &s;uch princes who acknowlege their de|pendence upon the &s;upreme Maje&s;ty of Heaven, and a&s;k coun&s;el of God, in all affairs of government, peace and war; who make him their &s;trength and confidence, honor his laws, ob&s;erve his providences, and give him the glory of their victories. What is too great to be expected under &s;uch a reign? What can give greater joy to a happy nation than to be|hold their king governing with wi&s;dom, prudence and ju&s;tice; aiming, in every thing, at the honor of God and their intere&s;t, protected by divine goodne&s;s, and reigning pro&s;perou&s;ly even to old age.</P>
<P>Long life may be con&s;idered as a great ble&s;&s;ing to the <HI>King him&s;elf:</HI> for though the life to come is infinitely preferable to the happie&s;t &s;tate on earth; and the honors of an heavenly kingdom, the never|fading crown of glory, the true and everla&s;ting riches, beyond all compari&s;on above earthly crowns and &s;ceptres, and the utmo&s;t &s;plendor of the king|doms of this world; &s;o that chri&s;tians, in the vigo|rous exerci&s;e of faith, would <HI>de&s;ire rather to be ab&s;ent from the body and pre&s;ent with the Lord,</HI> even though
<PB N="15" REF="008632_0013_102FA2C87270FAA8">
they had the highe&s;t enjoyments and noble&s;t pro&s;|pects which earth can afford: yet when our conti|nuance here may give us a farther opportunity of exerci&s;ing and improving the noble&s;t virtues; when we feel our&s;elves capable of doing yet greater &s;er|vice, and our hearts more and more inlarg'd with generous pa&s;&s;ions; when it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould continue here for the advantage of our fel|low men, e&s;pecially of the church; a chri&s;tian, even in the be&s;t frame, would a&s;k life, though with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and entertain with plea&s;ure the hope of doing greater good. This is the language of an apo&s;tle, anxious for the church's welfare <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. i. 23&mdash;25.</NOTE><HI>&mdash; I am in a &s;trait betwixt two, having a de&s;ire to depart and to be with Chri&s;t, which is far better: neverthele&s;s, to abide in the fle&s;h is more needful for you, and having this confidence, I know that I &s;hall abide and continue with you all, for your furtherence and joy of faith.</HI> In &s;uch a ca&s;e, life is a ble&s;&s;ing, and the greater as we move in a &s;phere of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>A good king enjoys the greater happine&s;s in life in proportion to his exalted dignity: He con&s;iders him&s;elf as a god to his &s;ubjects; and when he re|flects upon his benevolent &s;chemes yet but imperfect; when he views the important &s;ervices which lie be|fore him; when he &s;ees the nation yet in an un|&s;ettled &s;tate, and many farther regulations nece&s;&s;ary which he has &s;carcely had opportunity to attempt, religion and virtue demanding his patronage, and the future peace and pro&s;perity of his &s;ubjects greatly depending upon the continuance of his life; he will a&s;k it of God, and value it as a &s;pecial favour.</P>
<P>But to his happy people the long life of a good king is more e&s;pecially a ble&s;&s;ing. They con&s;ider
<PB N="16" REF="008632_0014_102FA2CA02EC2758">
him as their guardian, their father, the mini&s;ter of God. They &s;ee the wi&s;dom and equity of his go|vernment; they experience the &s;alutary effects: religion and virtue prevails; their liberties are guard|ed; every thing is brought into order, and it is put more and more out of the power of future princes to oppre&s;s them; &s;o that, for their own advantage, they cannot but wi&s;h to have his life and reign pro|longed.</P>

agreable to the la&s;t remark upon our text; which I &s;hall briefly illu&s;trate, to make way for a more par|ticular con&s;ideration of tho&s;e extraordinary circum|&s;tances which this day fill our hearts with joy, and demand our grateful prai&s;es to God.</P>
<P>REM. III. When God in his providence remark|ably defeats and &s;ubdues the enemies of his kingdom, <HI>good men</HI> will take peculiar notice of his power, and give glory to his name.</P>
<P>The generality of per&s;ons overlook the hand of providence even in the greate&s;t events; they regard not the works of the Lord, nor the operations of his hands. As they lightly glance over the &s;tupen|dous works of creation, and behold the &s;tarry &s;kies without ob&s;erving the incomparable wi&s;dom and unrival'd magnificence of that univer&s;al King, who has &s;pread &s;uch a pavement under his throne; as they behold the &s;un, re&s;toring and brightening the day, without con&s;idering the power and glory of that Being who kindled its blaze, and continues its revolutions; &s;o they are equally inattentive to the works of providence: they think of common events as things of cour&s;e; of events who&s;e cau&s;es are more &s;ecret, who&s;e appearances are more incon&s;tant and irregular, as meer ca&s;ualties; of evils or benefits as coming merely from men or nature. If they are involved in war, and things go again&s;t them; it is far from their thoughts that the enemy may be a &s;courge in the hand of God; they reflect only upon a weak or wicked mini&s;try, bad officers, and the like: if they have &s;ucce&s;s, they extol the generals and the troops, commend the wi&s;dom of the admi|ni&s;tration, and give all the glory to men; regardle&s;s
<PB N="19" REF="008632_0017_102FA2D4969E2D28">
of a &s;uperior Power, and tho&s;e acknowlegements which are due to God.</P>
<P>But wi&s;e ob&s;ervers will &s;ee the maje&s;ty and power, the ju&s;tice, di&s;plea&s;ure, or favor of the great Lord of the univer&s;e, in all the&s;e things; in the moral, as well as the material &s;y&s;tem; in common, as well as extraordinary appearances; in all occurrents, relat|ing to per&s;ons, families, or nations. E&s;pecially in the great affairs of government, or war, they &s;ee &s;ome of the plaine&s;t in&s;tances of that &s;upreme do|minion which God exerci&s;es over all mankind: how he regulates the kingdoms of this world, like &s;o many provinces of one general empire, under his own immediate care; marks their bounds; limits their privileges; balances their power; and retains them in &s;ubjection. They behold him judging among the nations; correcting them by one another, and by their own vices; puni&s;hing them for the abu&s;e of di&s;tingui&s;hing mercies, by the mo&s;t &s;ignal judgments; defending his church when &s;urrounded with enemies; and by his arm &s;trengthening the hands of kings who engage in his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Such an acknowlegement of Divine Providence nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;es from a proper belief of the Being and Perfections of God: the light of nature teaches it; all religion requires it. If He has no concern either with material or rational beings, after giving them laws of action agreable to their natures; but, without any farther exertions of Will or Power, leaves them to go on intirely of them&s;elves; what do we make of God more than an idle &s;pectator? In &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, He &s;eems to be introduced only to &s;ave the ab&s;urdity of an infinity of cau&s;es; or the eternity of the world: and when we have made u&s;e

of his name to give the fir&s;t birth to things, we lay it a&s;ide again, as if he were no more of any impor|tance.</P>
<P>How widely different is this from the religion taught in the &s;acred Scriptures! The Great God reveals him&s;elf in his word, not only as the Creator, but the Governor and Di&s;po&s;er of all things. In this maje&s;tic language He &s;peaks of his perpetual univer&s;al providence&mdash; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. xlv. 7.</NOTE> <HI>I form the light, and create darkne&s;s; I make peace, and create evil.&mdash;</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxii. 39.</NOTE> <HI>I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal.&mdash;</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai xlvi. 10.</NOTE> <HI>My coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand, and I will do all my plea&s;ure.</HI> There we find the &s;aints, in all ages, confe&s;&s;ing a continual Divine agency; looking to God for direc|tion and pro&s;perity in all their ways; ob&s;erving his providencial government; adoring his wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice; and prai&s;ing him for his mighty acts, and unbounded goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>As there are, in nature, &s;ome rare and &s;urprizing phenomina, to awaken the attention of mankind, and fix upon their minds a deeper conviction of the Being and Perfections of God: &s;o, in the cour&s;e of providence, there are great and remarkable events, de&s;igned as more &s;triking evidences of the Divine government, to continue and increa&s;e in the world a reverencial regard to his &s;upreme Maje&s;ty and autho|rity. It is mo&s;t rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that this is the principal point in which they centre, to promote religion and moral virtue: and it is ob&s;ervable in fact, that by many extraordinary and miraculous providences; by plagues, and famines; by wars, and de&s;olations; by the ri&s;e and fall of empires; and by continual changes in the affairs of nations; God has been carrying on one uniform de&s;ign from
<PB N="21" REF="008632_0019_102FA2D936EF9558">
age to age, to purify, enlarge and perfect his church, till all things &s;hall be prepar'd for the di&s;&s;olution of this pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, and the introduction of a more glorious happy &s;tate.</P>
<P>Therefore Good Men, when they are rejoicing in any public pro&s;perity, particularly in the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of war, will give honor to men, as in&s;truments by whom &s;uch great things are done for them; but they will give glory to God above all, who&s;e in&s;tru|ments they are. They will ob&s;erve how he glorifies him&s;elf and carries on his de&s;igns in favor of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s; how wonderfully he appears at one time and another for the &s;upport and defence of true religion; how remarkably he di&s;appoints it's adver&s;aries, even when they grow mo&s;t confident of &s;ucce&s;s, and takes them in their own craftine&s;s. They will take notice, by what &s;urprizing turns of providence the de&s;igns form'd again&s;t truth and liberty, and to introduce and propagate ignorance, &s;uper&s;tition and &s;lavery, are bla&s;ted and overthrown, and that very mi&s;chief brought upon the wicked projectors which they meditated again&s;t others. They behold the King of Heaven, in the&s;e things, accompli&s;hing his own purpo&s;es, notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition and rage of Earth and Hell; fulfilling his promi&s;es; magnifying his power and wrath again&s;t his enemies; and di&s;tingui&s;hing, by his wonderful goodne&s;s, tho&s;e who place their tru&s;t in him. When &s;uch things as the&s;e are vi&s;ible in our &s;ucce&s;&s;es, it is ju&s;tly expected we &s;hould take notice of them, and give glory to God, as exalting him&s;elf in his own &s;trength.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tians may triumph in the victories of war; but not as the heathen, who &s;hout and give honor
<PB N="22" REF="008632_0020_102FA2DF34F386D8">
to their idols with frantic noi&s;e, and bruiti&s;h &s;en&s;u|ality: the joy of <HI>chri&s;tians</HI> ought to be more ration|al, temperate, and noble, &s;pringing from a proper &s;en&s;e of the benefits receiv'd, and exciting religious &s;entiments and affections. They ought to rejoice and give glory to God; to a&s;cribe to him all the advantages they have gained; and prai&s;e him for &s;uch public ble&s;&s;ings, and the pro&s;perity of Sion. By this joy they will find their knowlege, love, and reverence of God increa&s;ing, and their faith and con|fidence in him more and more &s;trengthned.</P>
<P>But it is high time to pa&s;s from generals to a more particular application of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Therefore to bring the&s;e things home to our&s;elves</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place. <HI>We have rea&s;on to acknow|lege the glory of our</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>Monarchs as a peculiar favor of God.</HI> He has placed <HI>Great-Britain</HI> among the mo&s;t con&s;iderable powers in <HI>Europe,</HI> and made her kings rich and honorable, &s;o that they may vie with the greate&s;t ab&s;olute monarchs. Tyrants have the command of their people's pur&s;es, yet they often find them&s;elves poor; they are de&s;potic, but hated: but the kings of <HI>England</HI> have the affections of a free people; they are rich in the national wealth, which is freely granted whenever it is nece&s;&s;ary; and their authority is obeyed with plea&s;ure, with the firme&s;t loyalty, while they adhere to the con&s;titution, and love their &s;ubjects. Never did any nation more heartily abhor tyrants, or oppo&s;e with greater re&s;o|lution &s;uch &s;tretches of authority as are incon&s;i&s;tent with the natural rights of mankind: but no where can be found a more loyal people while their princes ob&s;erve the proper bounds of power, and aim to be benefactors. Every good king, crown'd according
<PB N="23" REF="008632_0021_102FA2E0CA213748">
to the &s;ettled laws of the realm, we revere as God's repre&s;entative, equally as if he could plead a divine right, in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion e&s;tabli&s;hed by Heaven.</P>
<P>The liberties of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and her pro&s;perity, have been remarkably favorable to the church of Chri&s;t: for true chri&s;tianity, the religion of Pro|te&s;tants, is in&s;eparably connected with free inquiry, conviction, and profe&s;&s;ion. Where the&s;e are ob|&s;tructed, though it may &s;upport it&s;elf under di&s;cou|ragements and per&s;ecutions, among a happy few, who&s;e minds, by divine grace, are taught to reverence the truth, and obey God rather than men; yet the church of Chri&s;t can have no firm footing in &s;uch a nation; it will be like a &s;tranger, di&s;countenanc'd, oppre&s;s'd, and denied any &s;ettled re&s;idence among them. As Tyranny, once e&s;tabli&s;h'd, commonly extends it's in&s;olence to blind and curtail men's un|der&s;tandings, and determine what they &s;hall believe, and how they &s;hall wor&s;hip; it mu&s;t either be taken away fir&s;t, in order to the introduction of true chri&s;ti|anity; or el&s;e if prote&s;tant principles &s;hould gradu|ally enter and gain ground, by &s;ome remarkable conduct of providence, they will effectually coun|terwork, weaken, and de&s;troy &s;uch tyranny, and re&s;tore both civil and religious liberty. Thus that &s;pirit of liberty which has appear'd from the fir&s;t foundation of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire, and &s;o often ex|erted it&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding the enchantments and chains of popery, prov'd very friendly to the refor|mation; and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the prote&s;tant religion has, on the other hand, greatly &s;ecured and inlarg'd our liberties.</P>
<P>Divine Providence has &s;eem'd to point out <HI>Britain,</HI> from the beginning, as a favorite nation, to make it
<PB N="24" REF="008632_0022_102FA2E3B9C12BE8">
a pattern to other kingdoms of the mo&s;t rational and equitable government; to &s;how how wealth, and power are connected with freedom, and to prepare the way for her enjoying a remarkable &s;hare in the ble&s;&s;ings of knowlege and true religion. The Great Lord of the world commonly performs the de&s;igns of his providence, not by immediate exertions of almighty power, but by means &s;uited to the general con&s;titution and cour&s;e of things. Therefore as Antichri&s;t had ingaged on his &s;ide the policy and arms of the greate&s;t empires in <HI>Europe</HI> to cru&s;h the Reformation; it was nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome earthly powers &s;hould be rais'd up to encourage and defend it. For this end, from &s;mall and confu&s;ed begin|nings, by wonderful &s;teps, through many &s;trange revolutions, God &s;trengthened and aggrandized the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation, increas'd knowlege and liberty among them, and made them the envy and terror of their neighbours, &s;o that they became the &s;trength and glory of the reformed churches.</P>
<P>The Roman-catholic powers con&s;ider'd <HI>England</HI> as the grand &s;upport of the northern here&s;y, as they term'd the Reformation: therefore they tried their utmo&s;t efforts, either to conquer, or reduce it under the Papal yoke. But He that &s;its in the Heavens derided them, and defeated all their attempts: in vain they formed &s;trong confederacies; in vain they fitted out the mo&s;t formidable Armadas <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Spaniards in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign.</NOTE>; in vain did Hell &s;ugge&s;t and carry on a &s;cheme to bur&s;t its fire from beneath, and de&s;troy at one blow all the Princes and Senators of the nation <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Gun powder Plot in the Reign of <HI>James</HI> I.</NOTE>: neither po|licy nor arms availed to &s;ubdue <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> or root out the prote&s;tant religion.</P>

<P>All the&s;e things together rais'd loud clamors in the nation; who look'd upon them&s;elves as on the brink of ruin; and complain'd of corruptions in the &s;tate, and <HI>public vices,</HI> as the real cau&s;es of all their di&s;appointments, more threatning than the whole power of the enemy.

<P>Now at &s;uch a juncture, had God, in righteous anger, taken from us our wi&s;e and good Sovereign, how unhappy and even fatal might have been the con&s;equences! The pre&s;ent illu&s;trious <HI>Prince of Wales</HI> was not ripe to manage the national affairs by his own judgment: his youth might have laid him open to the artful de&s;igns of corrupt politicians; who to gratify their own ambition, and &s;atiate their avarice, would have &s;acrificed all the intere&s;ts of the nation. As things were circum&s;tanced, many re&s;o|lute &s;teps were nece&s;&s;ary, which none but a <HI>&s;teady experienced</HI> King could ea&s;ily have ventured upon. Great oppo&s;ition might be expected; fierce conten|tions would naturally ari&s;e; and while the jarring parties were di&s;puting, and counterworking each other, our enemies might have made great advan|tage of &s;uch an un&s;ettled &s;tate, our &s;trength might &s;oon have been exhau&s;ted, the colonies lo&s;t, and the kingdom &s;eized upon and made a province of <HI>France.</HI></P>

<P>It is a happy circum&s;tance, which ought not to be overlook'd, that his Royal Highne&s;s the <HI>Prince of Wales</HI> has had the advantage of ob&s;erving the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent conduct of affairs, in &s;o critical a &s;ea&s;on.

While we give de&s;erved honors to the worthy Commanders of our armies and fleets, we mu&s;t remember <HI>that the victory is the Lord's,</HI> and that they are but in&s;truments in his hands by which he
<PB N="40" REF="008632_0038_102FA3118DB52BA8">
performs all the&s;e things for us. <HI>Amher&s;t, Wolfe, Bo&s;cawen, Saunders,</HI> are names which God has high|ly honored; they have been his officers to execute his purpo&s;es of goodne&s;s towards us, by cha&s;tening and &s;ubduing a proud, perfidious, and re&s;tle&s;s enemy: by them God has magnified <HI>his own power, exalted him&s;elf in his own &s;trength, and di&s;charged his arrows in the faces of the adver&s;aries of his Church.</HI></P>
<P>That which we have &s;o long been wi&s;hing for, which has been projected again and again, and at|tempted in vain, is now accompli&s;hed. <HI>Canada mu&s;t be &s;ubdued,</HI> has been the cry of <HI>New-England,</HI> ever &s;ince we have felt the effects of their barbarous prac|tices again&s;t us. Without any regard to the mo&s;t &s;olemn ratifications of peace, they have continually irritated the Salvages again&s;t the&s;e northern Provin|ces more e&s;pecially, and hired them to de&s;troy our towns, murder and captivate the inhabitants, and do us all the mi&s;chief in their power. We therefore had &s;ufficient rea&s;on to look upon <HI>Canada</HI> as wor&s;e than a <HI>Carthage</HI> to us, and make it our grand aim to de&s;troy or reduce it. But former Expeditions mi&s;|carried and came to nothing: corruption, treachery, or cowardice, and the vices of our armies, which were filled with the mo&s;t horrible profane&s;s, and en|feebled with luxury, drunkene&s;s, and debauchery, rendered all our &s;chemes abortive. The time was not come for our conque&s;t of that Country: their iniquities were not full; and we were not &s;ufficiently cha&s;ti&s;ed and humbled. But now <HI>we have &s;een that joyful day</HI> which our Fathers &s;o earne&s;tly wi&s;hed for. We may con&s;ider all <HI>Canada</HI> as reduced, unle&s;s there &s;hould be &s;ome farther remarkable interpo&s;ition of Providence. The pa&s;&s;ages of the Lakes are ours;
<PB N="41" REF="008632_0039_102FA314B9285AD0">
we have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Capital, and only Sea|port; they mu&s;t &s;urrender, or live another year without &s;upplies of provi&s;ion, and fight without am|munition. The <HI>Indians</HI> are for&s;aking their intere&s;t; our frontiers are quiet, and will be from henceforth &s;ecure, if we are permitted to enjoy, at the conclu&s;ion of the war, this important conque&s;t.</P>
<P>But, as Chri&s;tians, we &s;hould rejoice in the&s;e things chiefly as they relate to the Church and Kingdom of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. We are, by profe&s;&s;ion, the <HI>people of God. Great-Britain</HI> has been one of the fir&s;t among the reformed nations, and on her &s;ecurity and pro&s;perity the Prote&s;tant intere&s;t very much de|pends: and <HI>New-England</HI> has been highly favored with the light and liberty of the Go&s;pel; the doct|rines of Chri&s;t have been taught, and the wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline of his Church maintain'd with equal purity here, as in any other part of the world. And therefore for his own name's &s;ake, for the honor and advancement of true religion, God has granted us all this pro&s;perity. Zeal for pure religion brought over the Fathers of <HI>New-England</HI> from their native &s;oil, to plant churches, on the&s;e di&s;tant de&s;olate &s;hores, upon <HI>the foundation of the Prophets and Apo&s;tles, Je|&s;us Chri&s;t being the chief corner &s;tone:</HI> and God &s;miled upon their de&s;ign, and perform'd for them Wonders of Providence, almo&s;t parallel with what he did for <HI>I&s;rael</HI> when he bro't them out of <HI>Egypt;</HI> &s;o that we can with great propriety apply the words of the P&s;almi&s;t, and &s;ay&mdash;<HI>We have heard with our ears, &amp;c</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xliv. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE>. We now enjoy the word and ordinances of God in their original purity and &s;implicity, with that liberty which is the glory of chri&s;tianity; a ble&s;&s;ing from time to time has accompanied the means of grace; our Churches are greatly multiplied&punc; well &s;upplied with able and faithful <HI>Mini&s;ters of the New-Te&s;tament,</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="008632_0040_102FA31A8FCA4068">
and &s;preading farther and farther into the wilderne&s;s; and notwith&s;tanding our great declen&s;ions, there are multitudes not only of hone&s;t, &s;ober, virtuous pro|fe&s;&s;ors, but humble, obedient, exemplary chri&s;tians in our numerous Pari&s;hes, by whom the name of our <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is and will be glorified.</P>
<P>We may therefore behold the goodne&s;s of God to us, to the nation, to all the prote&s;tant Churches, in the late wonderful &s;ucce&s;s of our arms, and the arms of our Allies. Thus God is &s;trengthning and giving weight to the <HI>prote&s;tant intere&s;t,</HI> manife&s;ting his wrath again&s;t the <HI>antichri&s;tian powers,</HI> and preparing the way for the final ruin of that &s;piritual tyranny and <HI>my&s;tery of iniquity.</HI> For the&s;e ends He has rai&s;ed up and &s;upported his <HI>Pru&s;&s;ian</HI> Maje&s;ty; that like a &s;e|cond <HI>Cyrus,</HI> he may execute the Divine purpo&s;es again&s;t <HI>my&s;tical Babylon.</HI> God has given him the mo&s;t extraordinary military Genius, in&s;pired him with wi&s;dom and courage, upheld and &s;trengthned him, and &s;ubdued mighty armies before his &s;word, not meerly that he might be famous, as the <HI>Hero of the pre&s;ent age,</HI> but, as we have better rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e, to accompli&s;h &s;ome important de&s;igns of Pro|vidence in favor of the Church. Providence has joined us in alliance with him; we have &s;hared in his pro&s;perity; <HI>the Lord of Ho&s;ts has been with our armies; thro' God we have done valiantly, for He hath &s;ubdued our enemies before us. Twice</HI> the <HI>French</HI> have been di&s;appointed and totally defeated in their at|tempts upon <HI>Hanover:</HI> the former victory obtained over them by his <HI>Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty,</HI> in per&s;on; and the late fatal blow which they have received from <HI>Prince Ferdinand,</HI> are equally &s;urprizing, and happy in their con&s;equents.</P>
<P>When we review the repeated victories which have been obtained on the continent of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;ince
<PB N="43" REF="008632_0041_102FA31C476EF440">
the pre&s;ent war;&mdash;when we con&s;ider how our Fleets have alarmed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the enemy on their &s;ea-coa&s;ts, de&s;troyed their Navy, and ruined their Trade;&mdash; when we recollect all our conque&s;ts in <HI>Africa,</HI> the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and the&s;e northern parts of <HI>America;&mdash;</HI> when we con&s;ider how greatly this war has embarra&s;&s;ed and weaken'd <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> the two main Pillars of the Papacy;&mdash;we may &s;ee very evident tokens of God's favor to his Church, for the encouragement of all his faithful people to look and wait for the accompli&s;hment of his promi&s;es. The time will &s;hortly come, and it may be much nearer than we imagine, when it will be proclaimed with a &s;hout of general joy&mdash; <HI>Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen! rejoice over her thou heaven, and ye holy Apo&s;tles and Prophets, for God hath avenged you on her. They have &s;hed the blood of &s;aints and prophets, &amp; God hath given them blood to drink, for they are worthy.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>America,</HI> the immediate de&s;ign of Provi|dence may be to &s;ecure this part of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible Church, and make way for its greater enlargement and pro&s;perity; that the knowlege of the truth may &s;pread and fill the Continent; that Churches may ri&s;e up and &s;hine every where, thro' the wide countries which now lie wa&s;te; that the Go&s;pel may be pro|pagated in its purity, &s;implicity, and power, among the many thou&s;ands of indian tribes, which now live a ranging &s;alvage life round the va&s;t Lakes, and thro' the boundle&s;s fore&s;ts. Perhaps a door is now open|ing for prote&s;tant mi&s;&s;ions, where the Emi&s;&s;aries of <HI>Rome</HI> have been e&s;tabli&s;hing fal&s;hood and idolatry; that &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>the only Mediator,</HI> may be preached among them, and that they may be taught a virtuous civil life. This will make way for the proper improvement of our <HI>large&s;t charitable funds,</HI> to convert <HI>heathen nations,</HI> and tho&s;e who have
<PB N="44" REF="008632_0042_102FA31DD07FD4C8">
been deluded with <HI>popi&s;h &s;uper&s;titions,</HI> and bring them to the knowlege of God, and conformity to the doct|rines of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>God has been &s;tretching out his hand in favor of the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e, di&s;appointing the mi&s;chievous de&s;igns of the <HI>French,</HI> and requiting the perfidy and barbarity which they have &s;o long been practi&s;ing again&s;t the&s;e Colonies. He has at length bro't us into the &s;trong city, the Capital of a Country which to us has been like <HI>Edom</HI> to <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> Shall we not <HI>&s;ing, and prai&s;e his power?</HI> Let us behold and admire the&s;e remarkable di&s;plays of his goodne&s;s&punc; and a&s;cribe to him all the glory of tho&s;e great things which have been done for us. If we have a proper &s;en&s;e of his hand in all this, it will fill our hearts with unfeigned love and gratitude;&mdash;it will &s;trike our minds with deeper impre&s;&s;ions of religion;&mdash;it will lead us to &s;erve God, with greater zeal and cheerfulne&s;s, in all the duties of devotion, in the practice of univer&s;al holine&s;s, in our Churches and families, in our private and public conduct, according to all his laws and ordinances:&mdash;it will fill us with the highe&s;t e&s;teem of the glorious Go&s;pel, which he has committed into our hands; we &s;hall live as chri&s;tians, as true pro|te&s;tants, agreable to our high and holy profe&s;&s;ion, according to the purity and power of that excellent religion which is our glory.</P>
<P>We have already &s;ufficiently te&s;tified our Joy, in a civil way; we have given a decent public demon|&s;tration of our loyalty and love of our country, upon the news of our conque&s;ts; we have proclaimed <HI>the &s;ucce&s;s of his Maje&s;ty's arms</HI> to di&s;tant towns by thun|dering cannon, and indulged our joy by a &s;plendid evening &s;how <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About three weeks before this &s;ermon was deliver'd; a few days after the news of the &s;urrender of <HI>Quebec</HI> arrived here.</NOTE>. It will now be mo&s;t proper, and
<PB N="45" REF="008632_0043_102FA31F81159A68">
mo&s;t acceptable to God, that our joy be of a more compo&s;ed and religious kind, exerci&s;ed in the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration of the wonderful mercies grant|ed us from Heaven. Tho' we could have wi&s;h'd for <HI>more religious &s;olemnity</HI> on &s;uch an extraordinary oc|ca&s;ion, and even to have devoted a <HI>whole day</HI> to offer our grateful acknowlegements to <HI>the God of the ar|mies of I&s;rael,</HI> and meditate on his mercies; this would have been attended with &s;ome inconveniency this la&s;t day of the week.&mdash;We are called upon by authority "to perform divine &s;ervice in the morning <HI>only.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The words of the Proclamation for a general Thank&s;giving are, "the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are hereby directed to perform Divine Service in their re&s;pective congregations in the morning only, the after|noon being devoted to public <HI>rejoicings,</HI> and lawful <HI>diver&s;ions."</HI></NOTE> Let us therefore, <HI>while we are in the Hou&s;e of God,</HI> labour to offer our thank&s;givings to him with &s;incere hearts, and pure devotion.&mdash;But certainly if it would be inconvenient to &s;pend this whole day in religious exerci&s;es; it mu&s;t not only be inconvenient, but highly improper and &s;inful, to &s;pend the re&s;t of it in the noi&s;y, di&s;orderly, &s;en&s;ual mirth, and diver|&s;ions of the Mob, in revelling and drunkene&s;s, in any of tho&s;e things which either are vicious in them&s;elves, or tend to di&s;compo&s;e the mind, and unfit men for <HI>approaching holy time.&mdash;This evening is the prepara|tion, and the &s;abbath is at hand.&mdash;</HI>Noi&s;e and &s;how, Guns and Fireworks this evening, can never be plea|&s;ing to our King, as te&s;timonies of loyalty; but to the <HI>King of Heaven</HI> they mu&s;t be highly <HI>provoking,</HI> as the plaine&s;t indications that we have no becoming grateful &s;en&s;e of his Benefits.</P>
<P>We are ready to honor the King by the utmo&s;t te&s;timonies of due re&s;pect and allegiance: but whil&s;t we <HI>render to Ce&s;ar the things which are Ce&s;ars,</HI> we mu&s;t al&s;o be careful to <HI>render unto God the things
<PB N="46" REF="008632_0044_102FA3244E03AD50">
which are God's.</HI> We mu&s;t not break in upon that part of time which God, by an expre&s;s command, has re&s;erved for him&s;elf and the benefit of our &s;ouls; nor put our&s;elves into an un&s;uitable frame for the religious exerci&s;es of it.</P>
<P>I tremble for our Sabbaths.&mdash;If We, who have been a people hitherto remarkable for keeping up the &s;olemnity of the Lord's day, now grow carele&s;s, and fooli&s;hly affect and endeavour gradually to intro|duce an indifference and laxne&s;s in the ob&s;ervation of it; a general corruption of morals will immediately &s;ucceed, vice will break in upon us like a flood, and the <HI>Government</HI> will &s;oon very &s;en&s;ibly feel the &s;ad effects.&mdash;But, which is much more to be dreaded, this will bring down the <HI>anger of Heaven</HI> upon us: tho' we may be &s;ecure from enemies for many years to come, God has a variety of judgments with which he can puni&s;h a back&s;liding profane people. He can and will &s;end upon us other plagues, as di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, more de&s;tructive, than foreign arms, or Salvage cruelties.</P>
<P>But I need not enter any farther cautions again&s;t di&s;orderly <HI>ill-timed rejoicings:</HI> you will doubtle&s;s pay &s;o much regard to that melancholly providence, by which the joy of his <HI>Excellency our Governor</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His only Son JOHN WENTWORTH, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> died &s;uddenly on the thur&s;day before the delivery of this di&s;cour&s;e.</NOTE> is &s;uddenly turned into mourning, as to mourn with him in decent &s;ilence, omitting the intended parade and diver&s;ions of the day.</P>
<P>And now I cannot conclude without one hint at the mo&s;t proper application of the whole to the <HI>King|dom and Victories of Chri&s;t,</HI> that promi&s;ed <HI>Son of Da|vid,</HI> who&s;e throne is e&s;tabli&s;hed forever. God the Father has &s;et this glorious King upon his holy hill of Sion; He has rais'd him up to the throne of uni|ver&s;al

He will fulfil the prophecies of his Word, and pour out the vials of his wrath to the utmo&s;t upon antichri&s;tian nations.&mdash;But there is a greater and more dreadful <HI>Day of Wrath</HI> to come, when all the my&s;teries of providence and grace will be fini&s;h'd; when all the kingdoms of this world, and this whole vi&s;ible cre|ation &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved; when the wicked &s;hall be as &s;tubble to the flame, and all who know not God, and obey not the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, &s;hall be puni&s;h'd with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from his pre&s;ence and the glory of his power.&mdash;Let Sinners fear his wrath, and now make peace with him, while he offers to grant them not only the privileges of &s;ubjects, but the dignity and inheritance of children of the Mo&s;t High.&mdash;Let us acknowlege and obey him as our King and Savior, and we &s;hall rejoice that he lives, that he reigns and pro&s;pers; we &s;hall now triumph in all his victories, and &s;hall finally triumph forever with his &s;aints, enjoy all the ble&s;&s;ings of his glorious Kingdom, and reign with him in Life eternal.</P>
