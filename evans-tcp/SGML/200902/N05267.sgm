<HEAD>A LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend and dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IF
<Q>the Publication of a Narrative of the Ri&s;e, Progre&s;s and pre&s;ent Situation of Religion in <HI>Virginia,</HI> may not only gra|tify good People, but (as you give me Rea&s;on to hope) animate their Prayers for us, and al&s;o encourage Preachers to come into the&s;e Parts;</Q> I &s;hould charge my &s;elf with a crimi|nal Neglect, did I deprive this Colony of the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, by delaying or refu&s;ing to publi&s;h the marvellous Works of the Lord among us. Such Matters are liable to Mi&s;repre&s;entations; and I doubt not but the State of Religion in the&s;e Parts has &s;uffered the &s;ame Fate with other Facts reported by common Fame, and been mag|nified or dimini&s;hed to you. I &s;hall therefore, Sir, with as much Brevity and Accuracy as the Ca&s;e and my Cir|cum&s;tances will allow, give you <HI>an Account of the State of Religion among the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters in Virginia,</HI> not only in my Congregation in <HI>Hanover,</HI> but al&s;o in the Frontier Counties of this Colony, which are gene|rally inhabited by Di&s;&s;enters; which, after Peru&s;al, you may pre&s;ent to the Publick, or doom to Oblivion, as your Prudence will direct. I look upon my &s;elf under the mo&s;t &s;acred Obligations to maintain the &s;tricte&s;t Re|gard to Matter of Fact in my Narrative: and as my Re&s;idence in <HI>Hanover</HI> above three Years, and my Itine|rations
<PB N="4" REF="006657_0003_102975BEB02D63A8">among the vacant Congregations in the Frontier Counties, have furni&s;hed me with-peculiar Opportuni|ties of Information, my Mi&s;repre&s;entations would be the more inexcu&s;able.</P>
<P>My De&s;ign Sir, is not to inform the World of my petty per&s;onal Concerns, to boa&s;t of Pro&s;elytes, or to a&s;|per&s;e the Church of <HI>England</HI> here e&s;tabli&s;hed; and there|fore, to avoid Su&s;picions, I mu&s;t &s;uppre&s;s &s;undry Parti|culars that might be proper to mention in the Freedoms of amicable Conver&s;ation, but are not to be tru&s;ted to the Candour of a cen&s;orious World; and I have always tho't it an In&s;tance of Imprudence pregnant with mi&s;|chievous Con&s;equences, when Per&s;ons in &s;uch Ca&s;es un|bo&s;om them&s;elves to Mankind in general, with the un|guarded Liberties of intimate Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>It will not probably be worth while to give you any further Geographical Account of <HI>Hanover</HI> County, where the late Revival of Religion began, than that it is &s;itu|ated, I think, pretty near the Centre of <HI>Virginia;</HI> is a flouri&s;hing County, and generally very healthy to Per|&s;ons from all Nations; which I mention Sir, to remove your Scruple,
<Q>Whether this Climate agrees with the Con&s;titution of <HI>New-England</HI> Men?</Q></P>
<P>I hope I may ob&s;erve without the Umbrage of Calum|ny, what glares with irre&s;i&s;table Evidence on the Eyes of the Serious of all Denominations among us, that Re|ligion has been, and in mo&s;t Parts of the Colony &s;till is, in a very low State. A &s;urprizing Negligence appears in attending on publick Wor&s;hip; and an equally &s;ur|prizing Levity &amp; Unconcernedne&s;s in tho&s;e that attend. Family-Religion is a Rarity, and a &s;olemn Solicitude about eternal Things is &s;till a greater. Vices of various Kinds are triumphant, and even a <HI>Form of Godline&s;s</HI> is not common. The Clergy univer&s;ally, as far as my In|telligence extends, have embraced the modi&s;h Sy&s;tem of <HI>Arminian</HI> Divinity, (tho' I allow my &s;elf the Plea&s;ure to hope there are &s;undry con&s;ciencious Per&s;ons among them)
<PB N="5" REF="006657_0004_102975C1B4E6CD08">and the <HI>Calvini&s;tic,</HI> or rather PAULINE Articles of their own Church are counted horrendous and in&s;ufferable.&mdash; But I &s;uppo&s;e univer&s;al Fame has &s;uper&s;eded my Infor|mation; and therefore I willingly exempt my &s;elf from the di&s;agreable Ta&s;k.</P>
<P>I cannot find there has been a di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter &s;et|tled in <HI>Virginia,</HI> 'till lately, &s;ince its fir&s;t Plantation. You no doubt remember what Dr. <HI>Mather,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Neal</HI> from him, relate of the &s;ending of Me&s;&s;irs. <HI>James, Knowles,</HI> and <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> into it from <HI>New-England,</HI> at the Invitation of &s;undry of its Inhabitants, above a Hundred Years ago; and of their being compelled to depart the Colony by the Governour's Order, after preaching a few Sermons:
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Neal</HI>'s Hi&s;t. of <HI>N. England,</HI> Vol. I. p. 220. &s;ub an. 1642.</NOTE> Since which, there have been hardly any Attempts made to obtain &s;uch Mini&s;ters, 'till a few Years ago; and many of the Populace knew little or nothing of any Denomination, but that in which they had been educated.</P>
<P>I have Rea&s;on to hope Sir, there are and have been a <HI>few Names</HI> in various Parts of the Colony, who are &s;incerely &s;eeking the Lord, and groping after Religion, in the Communion of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> which I charitably pre&s;ume from my finding there were a few of this happy Character in &amp; about <HI>Hanover</HI> before the late Revival of Religion. Such were awakened, as they have told me, either by their own &s;erious Reflections, &s;ugge&s;ted and enforced by divine Energy; or on read|ing &s;ome Authors of the la&s;t Century, particularly <HI>Bolton, Baxter, Flavel, Bunyan,</HI> &amp;c. Some of them were wont to attend on publick Wor&s;hip in the e&s;tab|li&s;hed Church without much murmuring at the Enter|tainments there; tho' they were &s;en&s;ible the&s;e were va&s;tly inferior to what pa&s;t Ages were favoured with, and often wondered if there were &s;uch Doctrines taught any where in the World at pre&s;ent, as they found in the
<PB N="6" REF="006657_0005_102975C3473686F0">Writings of the&s;e good Men. Others of them, tho' they had no Objections again&s;t the Ceremonies of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> except a few who were &s;hocked at the impracticable Obligations impo&s;ed upon the Spon|&s;ors in Bapti&s;m, were utterly di&s;&s;atisfied with the u&s;ual Doctrines taught from the Pulpit. Tho' the&s;e were generally true, and would have been u&s;eful, in their Connection with the Scheme of evangelical Doctrines; yet &s;o many nece&s;&s;ary Truths were neglected, as rendered tho&s;e that were inculcated of very little Service. The whole Sy&s;tem of what is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the Name of <HI>experimental Religion,</HI> was pa&s;t over in Silence. The <HI>Depravity of humane Nature,</HI> the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity of Regeneration, and it's Pre-requi&s;ites, Nature and Effects,</HI> the <HI>various Exerci&s;es of pious Souls according to their &s;everal Ca&s;es,</HI> &amp;c. the&s;e were omitted; and with|out the&s;e, you know Sir, the fine&s;t Declamations on mo|ral Duties or &s;peculative Truths, will be but wretched Entertainment to hungry Souls. Such a maim'd Sy&s;tem is not the compleat Religion of JESUS, that glories in the amiable <HI>Symmetry,</HI> mutual <HI>Dependency</HI> and <HI>Sub&s;ervi|ency</HI> of all its Doctrines, as its peculiar Characteri&s;tic. Had the <HI>whole Coun&s;el of God</HI> been declared, had all the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel been &s;olemnly and faithfully preached in the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church; I am per&s;waded there would have been but few Di&s;&s;enters in the&s;e Parts of <HI>Virginia;</HI> for, as I ob&s;erved, their fir&s;t Objections were not again&s;t the peculiar <HI>Rites</HI> &amp; <HI>Ceremonies</HI> of that Church, much le&s;s again&s;t her excellent <HI>Articles;</HI> but again&s;t the general Strain of the <HI>Doctrines</HI> delivered from the Pulpit, in which the&s;e Articles were oppo&s;ed, or (which was the more common Ca&s;e) <HI>not mentioned at all:</HI> &s;o that at fir&s;t they were not properly <HI>Di&s;&s;enters from</HI> the original Con&s;titution of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but the mo&s;t &s;trict <HI>Adherents to</HI> it, and only di&s;&s;ented from tho&s;e that had for&s;aken it, tho' they &s;till u&s;urped the Deno|mination. But tho' &s;uch Impartiality in preaching the
<PB N="7" REF="006657_0006_102975C64715A4F8">Go&s;pel might have prevented the Advancement of the Intere&s;t of the Di&s;&s;enters <HI>as</HI> a Party, it would have tend|ed to promote the infinitely more valuable Intere&s;ts of the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer: and had this been the Ca&s;e, our Zeal and Indu&s;try to convert them to <HI>Pre&s;byteriani&s;m,</HI> would have been almo&s;t &s;uperfluous, and quite di&s;pro|portioned.&mdash;And here Sir, it may be proper to ob|&s;erve, That when in this Narrative I &s;peak of the In|crea&s;e of Di&s;&s;enters in the&s;e Parts with an Air of Satis|faction, I do not boa&s;t of them as meer <HI>Captures</HI> from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but as hopefully <HI>&s;incere Pro&s;e|lytes to living Religion,</HI> or at lea&s;t as lying open to Con|viction, and in the Way of more profitable Means. I cannot indeed but con&s;cienciou&s;ly di&s;&s;ent from &s;ome of the Peculiarities of that Church; and it tends a little to heighten our Satisfaction, when &s;uch as agree with us in <HI>E&s;&s;entials,</HI> and appear truly pious, do al&s;o agree with us in <HI>Circum&s;tantials;</HI> for as Agreement is the Foun|dation and Mea&s;ure of &s;ocial Love, <HI>this</HI> mu&s;t be co|extended with <HI>that:</HI> Yet as I am fully per&s;waded <HI>the Kingdom of God is not Meat &amp; Drink, but Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> and that Per&s;ons of &s;uperiour Piety and Judgment have u&s;ed the&s;e Rites and Ceremonies with Approbation; I think the Alte|ration of Men's Principles and Practice with Re&s;pect to the&s;e Things <HI>only,</HI> without being born again of God, is a wretched Conver&s;ion; and it would in&s;pire me with much greater Joy to &s;ee a <HI>pious Church-man,</HI> than a <HI>gracele&s;s Pre&s;byterian.</HI> I cheerfully embrace the Senti|ments of that illu&s;trious Divine Mr. <HI>Howe,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">&dagger; See <HI>Howe</HI>'s Works, Vol. II. p. 474.</NOTE>
<Q><HI>That without the Effu&s;ion of the Spirit from high,</HI></Q> to fa&s;hion the Hearts of Men into a Conformity to the ble&s;&s;ed God, and to prepare them for a happy Immortality,
<Q><HI>it matters little, and &s;ignifies to me &s;carce one Straw, what Party of us is uppermo&s;t:</HI> The mo&s;t Righteous,
<PB N="8" REF="006657_0007_102975CC36C656C0"><HI>(as they may be vogu'd) will be but as Bryars &amp; &s;cratching Thorns; and it is better to &s;uffer by &s;uch, than to be of them.</HI></Q> The chief Rea&s;on Sir, why I call upon you to congratulate the Increa&s;e of the Di&s;&s;enters here, and rejoyce in it my &s;elf, is, becau&s;e I have Ground to hope that the Number of the Heirs of Heaven is augmented in &s;ome <HI>Propor|tion,</HI> tho' alas! not to an Equality; and to triumph on inferior Accounts, would argue the narrow Genius of a <HI>Bigot.</HI> &mdash; But to return.</P>
<P>The Few that profe&s;s'd a Di&s;&s;atisfaction with the ge|neral Strain of Preaching in Church, and therefore ei|ther ab&s;ented them&s;elves, or attended with Murmuring and Reluctance, were generally counted whim&s;ical Crea|tures, and hypocritical Affectors of Singularity: and in|deed they could not but own their Sentiments &s;ingular; for they knew of none in the pre&s;ent Age of the &s;ame Mind with them; and therefore had no Pro&s;pect of obtain|ing a Mini&s;ter to preach to them tho&s;e Doctrines they thir&s;ted for. Their Notions, as far as I can learn, were &s;ound in the main; tho' intermix'd with &s;ome corrupt Noti|ons verging towards <HI>Antinomiani&s;m,</HI> the oppo&s;ite Extreme to that they had left. And tho' this rendered them more odious to their Adver&s;aries, and furni&s;hed them with Occa&s;ions more plau&s;ibly to expo&s;e them; yet, con&s;ider|ing their Circum&s;tances as being de&s;titute of a judicious Mini&s;ter to in&s;truct them in the Doctrines of the Go&s;|pel, and caution them again&s;t Mi&s;takes; and as la|bouring under the Prejudices of Education, and tran&s;|ported with the Sallies of their fir&s;t Zeal, which is ge|nerally imprudent and wild; I am more &s;urprized at their Soundne&s;s and Regularity in mo&s;t Things, than at their Mi&s;takes and Extravagancies in a few.</P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e about ten or twelve Per&s;ons who are now Members of my Congregation, had been for &s;ome Time before the Revival of Religion which began in the Year 1743. One Mr. <HI>Samuel Morris</HI> (for I am not a&s;hamed publickly to mention his Name, notwith&s;tanding the
<PB N="9" REF="006657_0008_102975CF41A39DE0">Calumnies flung upon it by many) a Per&s;on of a forward, &s;ociable Spirit, who had for &s;ome Time been extremely anxious about his eternal State, &amp; unweariedly &s;eeking Relief by all Means within his Reach, at length obtain'd a Di&s;covery of that glorious Method of Salvation thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to which Sinners <HI>from all the Ends of the Earth look, and are &s;aved,</HI> and where they univer&s;ally agree to &s;ix all their Hopes, notwith&s;tanding the great Diver&s;ity of their Circum&s;tances as to Situation, Education, outward In|&s;truction, &amp;c. The di&s;tinct Relation he has given me of his Exerci&s;es at that Time and &s;ince, and the prevail|ing Piety of his common Behaviour, leave me no Room to be anxious about the Sincerity of his Religion; tho', as it is common in &s;uch Ca&s;es, his former pious Zeal to do Good, with a few very pardonable Imprudences that attended it, have fix'd an indelible <HI>Odium</HI> on his Character among many who oppo&s;ed the religious Concern he at|tempted to promote. After this Di&s;covery of the Go&s;|pel, his Soul was anxious for the Salvation of his Neigh|bours, and inflamed with Zeal to u&s;e Means to awaken them. This was the Tendency of his Conver&s;ation; and he al&s;o read to them &s;uch Authors as had been mo&s;t u&s;eful to him, particularly <HI>Luther</HI>'s <HI>Comment upon the Galatians,</HI> which fir&s;t opened to him the Way of Ju&s;tification thro' Chri&s;t alone, and his <HI>Table-Di&s;cour&s;es;</HI> &s;undry Pieces of hone&s;t <HI>Bunyan</HI>'s &amp;c. By tho&s;e Means a few of his Neighbours were made more tho'tful about Religion than u&s;ual, and doubtful they had lived 'till then in a carele&s;s Ignorance of it; but the Concern was not very exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>I have prevailed, Sir, on my good Friend before men|tioned, who was the principal private In&s;trument of promoting the late Work, and therefore well acquainted with it, to write me a Narrative of its Ri&s;e &amp; Progre&s;s from this Period 'till my Settlement here: and this, together with the Sub&s;tance of what he and others have told me, I &s;hall pre&s;ent to you without any material
<PB N="10" REF="006657_0009_102975D0F0322A50">Alterations, and per&s;onate him, tho' I &s;hall not exactly u&s;e his Words.</P>
<Q><P>The Reverend Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> had been in <HI>Virginia,</HI> I think, in the Year 1740, and at the Invitation of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Blair,</HI> our late Commi&s;&s;ary, had preached in <HI>William&s;burg,</HI> our Metropolis, about 60 Miles from <HI>Hanover.</HI> His Fame was much &s;pread abroad, as a very warm and alarming Preacher; which made &s;uch of us in <HI>Hanover</HI> as had been awakened, very eager to &s;ee &amp; hear him; but as he left the Colony before we heard of him, we had no Opportunity. But in the Year &mdash;43, a young Gentleman arrived from Scotland with a Book of his Sermons preached in <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> &amp; taken from his Mouth in &s;hort Hand, which with Difficulty I procured. After I had read it with great Liking &amp; Bene|fit, I invited my Neighbours to come &amp; hear it; and the Plainne&s;s, Popularity, &amp; Fervency of the Di&s;cour&s;es, being peculiarly fitted to affect our unimproved Minds, and the Lord rendring the Word efficacious, many were convinced of their undone Condition, and con&s;trained to &s;eek Deliverance with the greate&s;t So|licitude. A con&s;iderable Number convened every Sabbath to hear the&s;e Sermons, in&s;tead of going to Church, and frequently on Week Days. The Con|cern of &s;ome was &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate and violent, that they could not avoid crying out, weeping bitterly, &amp;c. and that when &s;uch Indications of religious Concern were &s;o &s;trange and ridiculous, that they could not be oc|ca&s;ioned by Example or Sympathy, and the Affecta|tion of them would have been &s;o unprofitable an In|&s;tance of Hypocri&s;y, that none could be tempted to it. My Dwelling-Hou&s;e at length was too &s;mall to contain the People; whereupon we determined to build a Meeting-Hou&s;e, meerly for Reading; for we knew of no Mini&s;ter in the World whom we could get to preach to us according to our Liking; and having never been accu&s;tomed to &s;ocial <HI>extempore</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="006657_0010_102975D275961038">Prayer, none of us dur&s;t attempt it in Company. By this &s;ingle Mean &s;undry were &s;olemnly awakened, and their Conduct ever &s;ince is a living Atte&s;tation of the Continuance and happy I&s;&s;ue of their Impre&s;&s;ions. When the Report of the&s;e Sermons and the Effects occa&s;ioned by reading them was &s;pread Abroad, I was invited to &s;everal Places to read them, at a con&s;ide|rable Di&s;tance; and by this Means the Concern was propagated.</P>
<P>About this Time, our ab&s;enting our &s;elves from Church, contrary, as was alledged, to the Laws of the Land, was taken Notice of; and we were called up|on by the Court to a&s;&s;ign our Rea&s;ons for it, and to declare what Denomination we were of. As we knew but little of any Denomination of Di&s;&s;enters, except <HI>Quakers,</HI> we were at a Lo&s;s what Name to a&s;&s;ume. At length recollecting that <HI>Luther</HI> was a noted Re|former, and that his Doctrines were agreable to our Sentiments, and had been of &s;pecial Service to us, we declared our &s;elves <HI>Lutherans;</HI> and thus we conti|nued 'till Providence afforded us an unexpected Op|portunity of hearing the Rev. Mr. <HI>William Robin&s;on.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Here Sir, it may be proper for me to lay a&s;ide the Per&s;on of my Informer for a while, and interrupt the Connection of his Relation, to give you &s;ome Account of the Travels &amp; Succe&s;&s;es of that zealous, faithful and laborious Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, the late Mr. <HI>Robin&s;on,</HI> who&s;e dear Memory will mingle with my &s;ofte&s;t &amp; mo&s;t grate|ful Thot's, as long as I am capable of Reflection. He was in the Mini&s;try about &s;ix Years, and never took the Charge of a Congregation 'till a few Months before his happy and triumphant <HI>Exit.</HI> The nece&s;&s;itous Circum|&s;tances of many Vacancies, and the Pro&s;pect of more ex|ten&s;ive U&s;efulne&s;s engaged him to expo&s;e his &s;hattered Con&s;titution, to all the Hard&s;hips &amp; Fatigues of almo&s;t unioterrupted Itinerations; and it has been my Lot to trace his Travels in &s;undry Parts of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania, Mary|land</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="006657_0011_102975D58494F940">and <HI>Virginia;</HI> and I cannot recollect one Place in which he had officiated for any Time, where there were not &s;ome illu&s;trious Effects of his Mini&s;try. He had a noble di&s;intere&s;ted Ambition <HI>to preach the Go&s;pel, where Chri&s;t was not named;</HI> and therefore, by the Permi&s;&s;ion of the Pre&s;byte y, he took a Journey thro' the new Set|tlements in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania, Virginia,</HI> and <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> in which he continued about two Years, oppre&s;s'd with the u&s;ual Difficulties a weakly Con&s;titution finds in tra|velling a Wilderne&s;s, and animated only by his glorious Succe&s;&s;es. He continued for &s;ome Time in <HI>Lunenburg,</HI> a County about 100 Miles S. W. of this, where (as I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve more fully hereafter) a &s;mall Number of <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> from the northern Colo|nies were &s;ettled, intermixt with a Number of loo&s;e <HI>Vir|ginians;</HI> and there he was the happy In&s;trument of re|claiming many tho'tle&s;s Creatures, and founding a flou|ri&s;hing Congregation. In <HI>Amelia</HI> al&s;o, a County &s;ome|what nearer this than the former, his Labours were ex|ten&s;ively ble&s;s'd; and while he was there, or near it, &s;ome of the People in <HI>Hanover</HI> having had &s;ome imper|fect Information of him, &s;ent him an Invitation to come and preach to them, tho' they knew very little of his Character or Method of Preaching, only that it was un|common &amp; tended to awaken People. They ventured to make an Appointment for him to preach at their <HI>Reading-Hou&s;e</HI> (if I may &s;o call it) before they received any Promi&s;e from him by their Me&s;&s;enger; and with much Difficulty he came again&s;t the Day appointed. Some of the People were anxious to di&s;cover his Prin|ciples privately in the Morning before he was to preach; but knew not how, 'till they fell upon the Device of a&s;king his Opinion of &s;ome Books they approved of. Upon his declaring his Approbation of the&s;e Te&s;ts of Orthodoxy, they were tran&s;ported with the mo&s;t plea|&s;ing Expectations, and with eager Impatience attended him to the Place where he was to preach.</P>

I &s;hall now re-a&s;&s;ume the Per&s;on of my Informer, and proceed in his Narrative&mdash;<Q>On the 6th of <HI>July</HI>&mdash;43, 
Mr. <HI>Robin&s;on</HI> preached his fir&s;t Sermon to us from <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.3. and continued with us preaching four Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. The Congregation was large the fir&s;t Day; and as the Report of him &s;pread, it va&s;tly encreas'd on the three en&s;uing. 'Tis hard for the livelie&s;t Imagination to form an Image of the Condi|tion of the A&s;&s;embly on the&s;e glorious Days of the Son of Man. Such of us as had been hungring for the Word before, were lo&s;t in an agreable Confu&s;ion of various Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;urprized, a&s;toni&s;hed, plea&s;ed, enraptured! &s;o that we were hardly capable of Self|Government, and &s;ome could not refrain from pub|lickly declaring their Tran&s;port: we were overwhelm|ed with the Tho'ts of the unexpected Goodne&s;s of God, in allowing us to hear the Go&s;pel preached in a Manner that &s;urpa&s;&s;ed even our former Wi&s;hes, and much more our Hopes. Many that came thro' Cu|rio&s;ity were <HI>pricked to the Heart;</HI> and but few in the numerous A&s;&s;emblies on the&s;e four Days appeared unaffected. They returned a&s;toni&s;hed, alarmed with Apprehen&s;ions of their dangerous Condition, con|vinced of their former entire Ignorance of Religion, and anxiou&s;ly enquiring, what they &s;hould do to be &s;aved; and there is Rea&s;on to believe there was as much Good done by the&s;e four Sermons, as by all the Sermons preached in the&s;e Parts before or &s;ince.</Q></P>
<Q><P>Before Mr. <HI>Robin&s;on</HI> left us, he &s;ucce&s;sfully endea|voured to correct &s;ome of our <HI>Antinomian</HI> Mi&s;takes, and to bring us to carry on the Wor&s;hip of God more regularly at our Meetings. He advi&s;ed us to meet to read good Sermons, and to begin &amp; conclude with Prayer and &s;inging of P&s;alms, which 'till then we had omitted. When we met next, we complied with his Directions; and when all the re&s;t refu&s;ed, I read and prayed with Trembling and Diffidence; which Method was ob|&s;erved
<PB N="14" REF="006657_0013_102975DD4FC61DD0">in &s;undry Places 'till we were furni&s;hed with a Mini&s;ter. The Ble&s;&s;ing of God remarkably at|tended the&s;e more private Means; and it was really a&s;toni&s;hing to ob&s;erve the &s;olemn Impre&s;&s;ions begun or continued in many, by hearing good Di&s;cour|&s;es read. I had repeated Invitations to come to many Places round, &s;ome of them 30 or 40 Miles di&s;tant, to read; with which I generally comply'd. Con&s;iderable Numbers were won't to at|tend, with eager Attention and awful Solemnity; and &s;undry were, in a Judgment of Charity, thoro'ly turned to God, and thereupon erected Meeting|Hou&s;es, and cho&s;e Readers among them&s;elves, by which the Work was more exten&s;ively carried on.</P>
<P>Soon after our Father, Mr. <HI>Robin&s;on,</HI> left us, the Rev. Mr. <HI>John Blair</HI> paid us a &s;hort Vi&s;it; and truly he came to us <HI>in the Fulne&s;s of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI> Former Impre&s;&s;ions were ripened, and new formed on many Hearts. One Night in particular a whole Hou&s;e-full of People was quite over-come with the Power of the Word, particularly of one pungent Sentence that dropt from his Lips; and they could hardly &s;it or &s;tand, or keep their Pa&s;&s;ions under any proper Re&s;traints, &s;o general was the Concern during his Stay with us; and &s;o ignorant were we of the Danger Per&s;ons in &s;uch a Ca&s;e were in of Apo&s;tacy, which unhappy Ob&s;ervation has &s;ince taught us, that we plea&s;ed our &s;elves with the Expecta|tion of the <HI>gathering</HI> of more <HI>People to</HI> the divine <HI>Shiloh</HI> than now &s;eem to have been actually gathered to him; tho' there be &s;till the greate&s;t Rea&s;on to hope that &s;undry bound them&s;elves to the Lord in an everla&s;ting Covenant, never to be forgotten.</P>
<P>Some Time after this, the Rev. Mr. <HI>John Roan,</HI> was &s;ent by the Pre&s;bytery of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> (under who&s;e immediate Care we had voluntarily placed our &s;elves to &s;upply us. He continued with us longer
<PB N="15" REF="006657_0014_102975E04E88BBD0">than either of the former; and the happy Effects of his Mini&s;trations are &s;till apparent in many In&s;tances. He preached at &s;undry Places at the earne&s;t Solici|tations of the People, which was the happy Occa&s;ion of beginning and promoting the religious Concern, where there were little Appearances of it before. This, together with his &s;peaking pretty freely about the Degeneracy of the Clergy in this Colony, gave a general Alarm, and &s;ome Mea&s;ures were concerted to &s;uppre&s;s us. To incen&s;e the Indignation of the Govern|ment the more, a perfidious Wretch depo&s;ed, he heard Mr. <HI>Roan</HI> u&s;e &s;ome bla&s;phemous Expre&s;&s;ions in his Sermon, and &s;peak in the mo&s;t &s;hocking &amp; reproach|ful Manner of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church. An Indict|ment was thereupon drawn up again&s;t Mr. <HI>Roan,</HI> (tho' by that Time he had departed the Colony) and &s;ome of the People who had invited him to preach at their Hou&s;es, were cited to appear before the General Court, (which in this Government con&s;i&s;ts of the Governour or Commander in Chief, and His Maje&s;ty's Council) and two of them were fined <HI>twenty Shillings</HI> Sterling, be&s;ides the Co&s;ts, which in one of the Ca&s;es would have amounted to near <HI>fifty Pounds,</HI> had the Evidences demanded their Due. While my Cau&s;e was upon Trial, I had Rea&s;on to rejoyce that the Throne of Grace is acce&s;&s;ible in <HI>all Places,</HI> and that helple&s;s Creatures can waft up their De&s;ires <HI>un&s;een,</HI> to God, in the mid&s;t of a Crowd. Six Evidences were cited to prove the Indictment again&s;t Mr. <HI>Roan;</HI> but their Depo&s;itions were in his Favour; and as for the Evi|dence mentioned ju&s;t now, who accu&s;ed him of Bla&s;|phemy again&s;t God and the Church, when he heard of Me&s;&s;irs. <HI>G. Tennent</HI>'s and <HI>S. Finley</HI>'s Arrival, he fled, and has not returned &s;ince; &s;o that the Indict|ment was drop'd. I had Rea&s;on to fear being ba|ni&s;hed the Colony, and all Circum&s;tances &s;eem'd to threaten the Extirpation of Religion among the Di&s;&s;en|ters in the&s;e Parts.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="006657_0015_102975E4D2919DC8">
In the&s;e Difficulties we lay, without any Per&s;on of a publick Character to appear in our Favour; where|upon we determined to acquaint the Synod of <HI>New|York</HI> with our Ca&s;e; hoping that a Synodical Repre&s;en|tation of it to our worthy Governour, the Hon. Sir WILLIAM GOOCH, might free him from the Mi&s;in|formations under which he laboured, and procure us the Liberties granted to Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters by <HI>the Act of Toleration.</HI> Accordingly four of us went to the Synod, <HI>May</HI> 1745, when the Lord favour'd us with Succe&s;s. The Synod being inform'd of our Difficulties, and pre&s;uming they might be removed by an impartial Repre&s;entation of our Affairs, drew up an Addre&s;s to our Governour, and &s;ent the Rev. Me&s;&s;irs. <HI>G. Tennent</HI> and <HI>Samuel Finley</HI> to wait on his Honour to pre&s;ent it, and to officiate a few Days among us. Sir WILLIAM received them with Conde|&s;cention &amp; Re&s;pect, and granted them Liberty to preach in <HI>Hanover.</HI> By this Means the tremendous Cloud that hung over us was di&s;&s;ipated for a Time, &amp; our languid Hopes were revived. Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> and Mr. <HI>Finley</HI> continued with us about a Week, and tho' the Deluge of Pa&s;&s;ion in which we were at fir&s;t over|whelmed, was by this Time &s;omewhat abated; yet much Good was done by their Mini&s;try. The Peo|ple of God were refre&s;hed, and &s;undry carele&s;s Sin|ners were awakened. Some that had confided before in their moral Conduct &amp; religious Duties, were con|vinced of the Depravity of their Nature, and the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of being renewed in the Spirit of their Mind; tho' indeed there were but few uneregenerate Per&s;ons among us at that Time that could claim &s;o regular a Character; the Generality of Profe&s;&s;ors indulging them&s;elves in criminal Liberties, and being remi&s;s in the Duties of Religion; which alas! is too com|monly the Ca&s;e &s;till in &s;uch Parts of the Colony as the late Revival did not extend to.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="006657_0016_102975E656F0DD20">
After the&s;e Gentlemen had left us, we continued vacant for a con&s;iderable Time, and kept up our Meetings for Reading and Prayer in &s;undry Places; and the Lord favoured us at the&s;e Occa&s;ions with his gracious Pre&s;ence. I was again repeatedly pre&s;ented and fined in Court for ab&s;enting my&s;elf from Church, and keeping up unlawful Meetings, as they were called; <HI>but the Bu&s;h flouri&s;hed in the Flames.</HI></P>
<P>The next that were appointed to &s;upply us were the Rev. Me&s;&s;irs. <HI>William Tennent</HI> &amp; <HI>Samuel Blair.</HI> They waited on the Governour, and readily obtained his Permi&s;&s;ion to officiate among us. Their <HI>Labours were not in vain in the Lord.</HI> They admini&s;tred the Sacra|ment of the Lord's Supper among us before their Departure; which was the fir&s;t Admini&s;tration of that heavenly Ordinance among us &s;ince our di&s;&s;ent from the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and we have Rea&s;on to remember it 'till our la&s;t Moments, as a mo&s;t glori|ous Day of the Son of Man. The A&s;&s;embly was large, and the Novelty of the Mode of Admini&s;tra|tion did peculiarly engage their Attention. The <HI>Chil|dren</HI> were abundantly <HI>fed,</HI> and others were bro't to <HI>hunger and thir&s;t after Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> It appeared as one of <HI>the Days of Heaven</HI> to &s;ome of us; and we could hardly help wi&s;hing we could with <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> have delayed the Revolutions of the Heavens to prolong it.</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Tennent</HI> &amp; <HI>Blair</HI> continued with us about a Fortnight, and immediately after their Departure, Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> came and preached four or five Days in the&s;e Parts; which was the happy Means of giv|ing us farther Encouragement, and engaging others to the Lord, e&s;pecially among the Church-People, who received his Doctrines more readily than they would from Mini&s;ters of the Pre&s;byterian Denomination.</P>
<P>After his Departure, we were de&s;titute of a Mini|&s;ter, and followed our u&s;ual Method of Reading and Prayer at our Meetings, 'till the Rev. Mr. <HI>Davies,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="006657_0017_102975E96A3DFAE8">our pre&s;ent Pa&s;tor, was &s;ent by the Pre&s;bytery to &s;up|ply us about &s;ix Week, in Spring, <HI>Anno</HI> 1747, when our Di&s;couragements from the Government were re|newed and multiplied: For on one Sunday the Gover|nour's Proclamation was &s;et up at our Meeting-Hou&s;e, <HI>&s;trictly requiring all Magi&s;trates to &s;uppre&s;s &amp; prohibit, as far as they lawfully could, all itinerant Preachers,</HI> &amp;c.
which occa&s;ion'd us to forbear Reading that Day, 'till we had Time to deliberate and con&s;ult what was ex|pedient to do; but how joyfully were we &s;urprized before the next Sabbath, when we unexpectedly heard that Mr. <HI>Davies</HI> was come to preach &s;o long among us; and e&s;pecially, that he had qualified him&s;elf ac|cording to Law, and obtained the Licen&s;ure of four Meeting-Hou&s;es among us, which had never been done before! Thus when our Hopes were expiring, and our Liberties more precarious than ever, we were &s;uddenly advanced to a more &s;ecure Situation. <HI>"Man's Extremity is the Lord's Opportunity."</HI> For this &s;ea&s;o|nable In&s;tance of the Interpo&s;ition of divine Provi|dence, we de&s;ire to offer our grateful Prai&s;es; and we importune the Friends of <HI>Zion</HI> generou&s;ly to con|cur in the delightful Employ.</P></Q>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have given you a brief Account of the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of Religion here 'till my fir&s;t coming into the Colony; and the Facts them&s;elves I know to be well atte&s;ted, tho' the Order in which I have related them, is in &s;ome In&s;tances prepo&s;terous.&mdash;I &s;hall now proceed in my Narrative from my own Knowledge, and inform you of the State of Affairs &s;ince <HI>April</HI> 1747.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters here were under peculiar Di&s;advanta|ges for want of a &s;ettled Mini&s;ter. By this they were not only deprived of the &s;tated Mini&s;trations of the Go&s;|pel, but al&s;o expo&s;ed to great Difficulties from the Go|vernment, which could not be wholly removed while they continued vacant; for it was alledged, (this is no proper Place to enquire with how much Law or Rea&s;on)
<PB N="19" REF="006657_0018_102975EB011947D0">that 'till they were an organized Congregation, and had a Mini&s;ter qualified, and their Meeting-Hou&s;es lic<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">s'd, according to Law, they could not claim the Liberties and Immunities of the Act of Toleration. Be&s;ides, the Itinerations of my Brethren, tho' occa&s;ioned by Nece&s;&s;ity, were mi&s;con&s;tructed, as turning all Things up&s;ide down, as a meer Artifice to wheedle People out of their Money, and as an Evidence there were &s;uch prodigious Swarms of us to the Northward, that we were obliged to make Excur&s;ions into di&s;tant Parts: When indeed the chief Rea&s;on was the &s;mall Number of our Mini&s;ters &amp; Can|didates, which was va&s;tly di&s;proportioned to the Vacan|cies in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and much more to tho&s;e in <HI>Mary|land</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> (not to mention the Di&s;couragements that would be naturally &s;ugge&s;ted to young Mini&s;ters, at the Thoughts of removing to a &s;trange Colony, &s;e|parated from their Brethren, expo&s;ed to peculiar Fa|tigues, and the Embarra&s;sments of &s;o limitted and pre|carious a Toleration as they then had Rea&s;on to expect.) On the&s;e Accounts the Synod, and particularly the Pre&s;bytery of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> were very &s;olicitous to &s;ettle a Mini&s;ter among them as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. I was there|fore &s;ent by &s;aid Pre&s;hytery into <HI>Hanover</HI> at the Time mentioned above, both to officiate for &s;ome Time, and to &s;ee if my Way &s;hould be cleared to &s;ettle there. Upon my Arrival, I petitioned the General Court to grant me a Licen&s;e to officiate in and about <HI>Hanover,</HI> at four Meeting-Hou&s;es; which after &s;ome Delay, was granted, upon my qualifying according to the Act of Toleration, i. e. taking the u&s;ual Oaths to His Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Government, getting the Meeting-Hou&s;es recorded, and &s;ub&s;cribing the Articles of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> except the 34, 35, 36, and this Clau&s;e of the 20th,

<P><PB N="20" REF="006657_0019_102975EF780F8448">
I preach'd frequently in <HI>Hanover</HI> and &s;ome of the ad|jacent Counties at this Time; and tho' the Fervour of the late Work was con&s;iderably abated, and my La|bours were not ble&s;&s;ed with Succe&s;s equal to tho&s;e of my Brethren; yet I have Rea&s;on to hope they were of Service in &s;undry In&s;tances. I have conver&s;ed with a few &s;ince, that were awakened at that Time; and &s;un|dry that had been under langui&s;hing Concern, were ha&s;t|ning to the Birth. The Importunities they u&s;ed with me to &s;ettle were invincible; and upon my Departure, they &s;ent a Call for me to the Pre&s;bytery, which, with three be&s;ides, from other Places, all very nece&s;&s;itous, I took under Con&s;ideration. I was fully convinc'd <HI>Hano|ver</HI> &s;tood in greater Need of a Mini&s;ter than any Place I knew; and that if my Health permitted, and none of my Brethren could be prevailed upon to &s;ettle there, I could not refu&s;e their Call con&s;i&s;tently with Duty. After my Return from <HI>Virginia,</HI> I &s;pent near a Year under melancholy and con&s;umptive Langui&s;hments, which I certainly expected would have conveyed me into the eternal World; and by this I hoped to be exempted from the di&s;agreable Obligation. In the Spring 1748, I began &s;lowly to recover; tho' I then looked upon it only as the Intermi&s;&s;ion of a Di&s;order that would finally prove mortal. But upon the Arrival of a Me&s;&s;enger from <HI>Hanover,</HI> I <HI>put my Life in my Hand,</HI> and determin'd to accept of their Call; hoping I might live to organize the Congregation, and prepare the Way for &s;ome more u&s;eful Succe&s;&s;or; and willing to expire under the Fa|tigues of Duty, rather than in voluntary Negligence.&mdash; But I forget, Sir, that this Narrative may perhaps be pre&s;ented to the Publick, and indulge my&s;elf in an <HI>Egoti&s;m,</HI> as tho' I were writing only to a Friend. The only Apology I can make is, that &s;ome of my per&s;onal Affairs are &s;o interwoven with tho&s;e of this Congregation, that I find it difficult to relate the latter, without u&s;ing too great Freedoms in the former. However, you have
<PB N="21" REF="006657_0020_102975F3FA9321E8">my full Con&s;ent to obliterate whatever you think un|worthy of a publick View.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Brother, the Rev. Mr. <HI>John Rodgers,</HI> was &s;ent along with me to <HI>Hanover,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t me for a few Sabbaths at my fir&s;t Settlement. But when he offer'd him&s;elf in the General Court to take the Qualifications enjoined by Law, he was rejected, under Pretence that his Certificate not being granted by the Synod, and par|ticularly that of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but only by the Pre&s;bytery, was in&s;ufficient, (tho', by the Bye, it was as &s;ufficient as mine, which they had admitted; and given according to univer&s;al Pre&s;ident among Pre&s;byterians) whereupon he was obliged to return without preaching but one Ser|mon.</P>
<P>On this Occa&s;ion, as well as all others, we had Rea|&s;on to acknowledge with the mo&s;t dutiful Gratitude, the Conde&s;cen&s;ion and Clemency of the Hon. Sir WILLIAM GOOCH, our late Governour, who always di&s;covered a ready Di&s;po&s;ition to allow us all claimable Priviledges, and the greate&s;t Aver&s;ion to per&s;ecuting Mea&s;ures; but con&s;idering the horrendous &amp; &s;hocking Reports &s;pread Abroad concerning us by officious Malignants, it was no great Wonder the Council di&s;covered a con&s;iderable Reluctancy to tolerate us. Had it not been for this, I per&s;wade my &s;elf they would have &s;hewn them&s;elves the Guardians of our legal Priviledges, as well as generous Patriots to their Country; which is the illu&s;trious Cha|racter generally given them.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, Sir, before, that I obtained the Licen&s;ure of four Meeting-Hou&s;es when I fir&s;t came to the Colony. In <HI>October</HI> 1748, the People petitioned for the Licen&s;ure of three more, which with great Difficulty was obtained. Among the&s;e &s;even, I have hitherto divided my Time, in Proportion to the Number of Di&s;&s;enters at each Meet|ing-Hou&s;e: Three of them lie in <HI>Hanover</HI> County, one in <HI>Henrico</HI> County, which lies Southward; one in <HI>Caro|line</HI> County, which lies Northward; one in <HI>Loui&s;a</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="006657_0021_102975F583F3F298">County, &s;ituated to the We&s;tward; and one in <HI>Gooch|land,</HI> to the South-we&s;t of <HI>Hanover.</HI> The neare&s;t are 12 or 15 Miles di&s;tant from each other, and the Extremes about 40. My Congregation is very much di&s;per&s;ed; and notwith&s;tanding the Number of the Meeting-Hou|&s;es, &s;ome live 20, &s;ome 30, and a few 40 Miles from the neare&s;t. Were they all compactly &s;ituated in one County, they would be &s;ufficient to form three di&s;tinct Congregations; but in their pre&s;ent Situation, I believe they could con&s;titute but two large ones, each capable of affording a competent Maintenance to a Mini&s;ter. At the lower Meeting-Hou&s;e in <HI>Hanover,</HI> which I took more immediately as my Charge when I accepted their Call, there is a &s;ufficient Number to form a large Congrega|tion; but as it lies between that in <HI>Caroline,</HI> and that in <HI>Henrico</HI> which are but weak, it would &s;eem cruel to &s;e|parate it from them, as they could not each of them maintain a Mini&s;ter of their own. The People about the four upper Meeting-Hou&s;es are waiting for a Mi|ni&s;ter with impatient Eagerne&s;s, and intend to reduce their Hou&s;es into three.</P>
<P>Were you Sir, to preach at any of the&s;e Hou&s;es, where there is the &s;malle&s;t Number of Di&s;&s;enters, you would imagine there was a &s;ufficient Number of People to form a di&s;tinct Congregation at each of them; for where there are not above 15 or 20 Families that have fully join'd with me, you'l &s;ee perhaps 4 or 500 Hearers, and &s;ometimes twice that Number; the Church-People in general being very eager to hear. This I looked upon at fir&s;t as a meer Curio&s;ity after Novelty; but as it continues in general without Abatement, and in &s;ome Places &s;eems to increa&s;e; I cannot but look upon it as a happy Pre&s;age. This I have the more Rea&s;on to do now, as I have ob&s;erved many of the&s;e neutral Hearers become at length thoroughly engaged, and &s;undry of them bro't to be &s;olemnly tho'tful. I believe I could number up 50 or 60 Families, who have thus been hap|pily
<PB N="23" REF="006657_0022_10293C680E08A6C0">intangled in the Net of the Go&s;pel by their own Curio&s;ity, or &s;ome &s;uch Motive, &s;ince my coming here; and I have Rea&s;on to hope, that were there another Mi|ni&s;ter &s;ettled here, it would cau&s;e a very great Addition to our Number. Indeed this appears to me the mo&s;t promi&s;ing Circum&s;tance that at pre&s;ent attends us; for alas! there &s;eems no great Pro&s;pect of the Conviction of tho&s;e that are thoroughly pro&s;elyted, and yet have re&s;ted &s;hort of real Religion (tho' ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, a few of them are awakened now and then) but when any of the&s;e tran&s;ient Hearers, that are at their own Di&s;po&s;al, and not under the Influence of their Re|lations, &amp;c. who are already attached, do join with us, 'tis generally a Sign of &s;ome con&s;iderable Degrees of Conviction; as the Epithet <HI>New-Light</HI> (the u&s;ual Brand with which we are here &s;tigmatized) is &s;o reproachful, that the Secure will not venture to incur the <HI>Odium.</HI></P>
<P>There are about 300 Communicants in my Congre|tion, who make an external Profe&s;&s;ion of real Religion. I am not fond of publi&s;hing a Calculation of Chri&s;tians; as I am &s;en&s;ible of the Fallibility of my Judgment in &s;uch Ca&s;es: but it is impo&s;&s;ible for a Heart anxious for the Salvation of Men, to deny it&s;elf the Comfort of counting up at Times the Number of tho&s;e that appear &s;uch in a Judgment of rational Charity; and I enter|tain the plea&s;ing Hope that the greate&s;t Number of the&s;e Communicants are &s;incere in their Profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;hall <HI>walk with Chri&s;t in White</HI> in the Fields of immortal Glory. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are many that are con&s;tant Hearers and cordial Pro&s;elytes, who thro' a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Un|fitne&s;s, or exce&s;&s;ive Scrupulo&s;ity, do not &s;eek Admi&s;&s;ion as yet to the Lord's Table.</P>
<P><HI>Ethiopia has</HI> al&s;o <HI>&s;tretched forth her Hands unto God.</HI> There is a great Number of Negroes in the&s;e Parts; and &s;ometimes I &s;ee a 100 &amp; more among my Hearers. I have baptized about 40 Adults of them within the&s;e three Years, upon their making &s;uch a Profe&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="24" REF="006657_0023_102975FE765DB980">&s;aving Faith as I then judged credible. Some of them, I fear, have apo&s;tatized; but others of them, I tru&s;t, will per&s;evere to the End. I have had as &s;atisfactory Evidences of the &s;incere Piety of &s;undry of them, as ever I had from any Per&s;on in my Life; and their art|le&s;s Simplicity, their pa&s;&s;ionate A&s;pirations after Chri&s;t, their ince&s;&s;ant Endeavours to learn and do the Will of God, have charmed my very Soul. But alas! while my Charge is &s;o exten&s;ive, and my Labours parcelled out among &s;o many, I cannot take &s;ufficient Pains with them for their In&s;truction; which often oppre&s;&s;es my Heart.</P>
<P>There have been, Sir, a few In&s;tances of unhappy Apo&s;tacy among us; but I count it a peculiar Ble&s;&s;ing, that there have not been &s;o many Back&s;liders here, in Proportion to the Number once awakened, as I have ge|nerally ob&s;erved in other Places, where there has been a great religious Commotion.</P>
<P>There are a few that I know of at pre&s;ent under deep and promi&s;ing Impre&s;&s;ions, and &s;undry langui&s;hing un|der feeble Convictions: But in general, a lamentable Security prevails; and, as it generally happens in a Time of the Withdrawment of the divine Pre&s;ence, the faint Impre&s;&s;ions that are made on &s;ome by the Dint of Preaching, &s;oon wear off.&mdash;Oh! for a <HI>little Revival in our Bondage!</HI> In this Prayer Sir, I doubt not but you will heartily join, and endeavour to procure the Con|currence of others in &s;o &s;ea&s;onable a Petition.</P>
<P>La&s;t Sabbath I admini&s;tred the Lord's Supper at one of my Meeting-Hou&s;es; and there appeared more So|lemnity and Affection in the numerous A&s;&s;embly, than I have &s;een for &s;ome Months.</P>
<P>I might Sir, have given you a <HI>particular</HI> Account of the Conver&s;ion of &s;ome Per&s;ons here; as indeed there are &s;ome uncommon In&s;tances of it: but it would oc|cupy too much of my Time, and &s;well this Hi&s;tory to an exce&s;&s;ive Bulk. It may &s;uffice in general to ob&s;erve,
<PB N="25" REF="006657_0024_1029760000621560">that ab&s;tracting peculiar Appendages and in different Circum&s;tances, the Work of Conver&s;ion here has been generally carried on in tho&s;e Steps that are de&s;cribed by experimental Divines, as <HI>Alliene, Shepherd, Stoddard, Fla|vel,</HI> &amp;c. And there's nothing confirms me more in the Truth of their Notions of experimental Piety, than the univer&s;al Uniformity and Agreement in Sub&s;tance of the Exerci&s;es of tho&s;e that can make the faire&s;t Claim to &s;aving Grace, however different their Re&s;idences, Education, external Means, &amp;c. be.</P>
<P>There is one <HI>I&s;aac Oliver</HI> here, a Miracle of a Man, who&s;e Hi&s;tory, could I write it intelligibly to you, would be very entertaining. He has been deaf &amp; dumb from his Birth, and is now grown up to Manhood. The want of the&s;e Faculties rendered him wholly incapable of all humane Conver&s;e &amp; In&s;truction, except by <HI>Signs;</HI> and as for the mo&s;t of divine Things, they &s;eem to me of &s;o ab&s;tract and &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">al a Nature, that the fir&s;t No|tions of them can never be conveyed by this ob&s;cure Medium: And yet (I mention it with grateful Wonder) I have the utmo&s;t Rea&s;on to believe he is truly gracious, and al&s;o acquainted with mo&s;t of the Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, and many Matters of Fact related in the hi&s;torical Part of the Bible. I my &s;elf have &s;een him repre&s;ent the Crucifixion of Chri&s;t, the Swallowing and Ejection of <HI>Jonah</HI> by the Whale, &amp;c. in &s;uch &s;ignificant Signs, that I could not but under&s;tand them. Some of his Signs whereby he de&s;cribed Heaven and Hell were al&s;o intelligible to me; but many of them about other Things, I could make nothing of. Tho&s;e that live in the Hou&s;e with him, can hold an intelligible Conver&s;a|tion with him, and he with them, upon mo&s;t of Things, with &s;urprizing Readine&s;s; and he undoubtedly has the mo&s;t &s;ignificant Ge&s;tures of any Man I ever &s;aw in my Life, which his Relations under&s;tand by repeated Ob&s;er|vation, and u&s;e them to communicate their Tho'ts to him. There is &s;o much of the devout Ardour of his
<PB N="26" REF="006657_0025_1029760186089610">Soul di&s;covered in them at Times, as is really affecting; and I have &s;een him conver&s;e in Signs about the Love and Sufferings of Chri&s;t, 'till he has been tran&s;ported with Earne&s;tne&s;s, and di&s;&s;olved into affectionate Tears. The above Mr <HI>Morris,</HI> with whom he lives, has told me, that <HI>I&s;aac</HI> informs him he had the&s;e Di&s;coveries of divine Things made to him while in Bed, probably in a Dream; and that eight Years ago he appeared remar|kably changed in Temper and Conduct. He &s;eems ever &s;ince very con&s;ciencious in the whole of his Beha|viour; generally delights to attend public &amp; dome&s;tic Wor&s;hip, tho' he cannot hear a Word; and is ob&s;erved &s;ometimes to retire for &s;ecret Devotion; tho' he &s;ignifies that he is praying with his Heart, when about his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, or in Company; which is peculiarly practicable to him, as in all Places he enjoys the undi&s;turbed Sere|nity of Retirement. He di&s;covers an expert Genius in tho&s;e Things he is capable of, particularly in &s;undry mechanical Employments; and his Pa&s;&s;ions &s;eem very vigorous: in any pa&s;&s;ionate Emotions, his whole Vi&s;age and all his Ge&s;tures are &s;urprizingly expre&s;&s;ive of the Temper of his Mind; &s;o that he &s;eems to &s;tand in the lea&s;t Need of the Faculty of Speech of any Man I have known.&mdash;I could relate &s;undry other remarkable Pe|culiarities concerning him; but as they are unintelligi|ble to my &s;elf, or might &s;eem incredible to tho&s;e that are unacquainted with him, I omit them.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis the general Opinion of tho&s;e that are acquainted with him, and e&s;pecially of the Family where he lives, who have be&s;t Opportunities of ob&s;erving him, that he can read. The fir&s;t Evidence of it appeared when he &s;eemed to be fir&s;t under religious Impre&s;&s;ions; for he was then ob&s;erved to be frequently taking the Bible and looking into it: and ever fince, he gives the following Evidences of it: He frequently looks into the Bible, or other good Books, with great Inten&s;ene&s;s; and &s;ome|times points with his Finger to &s;ome particular Sentences, and tries to per&s;wade others to read them; and the&s;e Sentences, as the Family tells me, are peculiarly affecting, and worthy of di&s;tinct Notice. If you put a Book into his Hand inverted, he will im|mediately turn it into a proper Po&s;ition. When a Hi&s;tory, or the like, is put into his Hand, after looking into it a little while, he throws it away with Signs of its U&s;ele&s;ne&s;s; but give him a Bible, tho' it were of a Size and Character he never &s;aw before, or &s;ome other good Book upon religious Subjects, he hugs it in his Bo&s;om with Signs of the mo&s;t endeared Approbation. He intimates by Signs, that the Almanack treats of the Sun, Moon and Stars, the Weather, &amp;c. I have opened the Bible in <HI>Jonah,</HI> and &s;hewn it him; and after a little Peru&s;al, he has given me a very lively De&s;cription of the Fate of that Prophet. &mdash; Many other &s;uch Things are ob&s;ervable concerning him; but whether the&s;e are &s;ufficient Indications that he can read, and whether they are fit to be offered to public View, is wholly &s;ubmitted to your Judg|ment. If he can receive Ideas from vi&s;ible Characters, which to him cannot be the Signs of Words or Sounds, it mu&s;t be entirely miraculous. Every One mu&s;t &s;ee, that no Methods could be u&s;ed to teach one to read, who has been entirely deaf and dumb from the fir&s;t Point of his Exi&s;tence: And tho' we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e him to have as expert a Genius as the fir&s;t Inventors of Characters as the Signs of Words; yet, as he is wholly ignorant of the Na|ture of Language, it appears inconceivable to me how he could po&s;&s;ibly find out the arbitrary Connection between Letters and Ideas, without the Medium of Words. But <HI>is there any Thing too hard for the Lord?</HI>&mdash;</NOTE> So much,
<PB N="27" REF="006657_0026_1029760311E45E38">however, I know of him, that I cannot but look upon him as a miraculous Monument of almighty Grace, that can perform its beneficent Purpo&s;es on Mankind, notwith&s;tanding the greate&s;t natural or moral Impedi|ments; and I &s;ubmit it to others Judgment, whether a Per&s;on &s;o incapable of external In&s;tructions, could be brought to know the My&s;teries of the Kingdom of Hea|ven any other Way than by immediate Revelation. &mdash; Be&s;ides the People here, &s;undry of my Brethren, who have been here, particularly the Rev.

I forgot to inform you, Sir, in its proper Place, that the Rev. Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> was &s;ent by the Synod to <HI>Ha|nover</HI> la&s;t Summer, &amp; continued here about 2 Months.

<P>Thus, dear Sir, I have given you a brief Narrative of the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of Religion among us; and I doubt not but you will readily acquie&s;ce in the Conclu|&s;ion which after &s;ufficient Scrutiny I have drawn, <HI>That this is the Lord's Doing.</HI> I claim no <HI>Infallibility;</HI> but I mu&s;t not under the mode&s;t Pretence of renouncing it, &s;cruple a Matter atte&s;ted with all po&s;&s;ible Evidences, and &s;o ru&s;h into <HI>Septici&s;m.</HI> If I could form no Judg|ment of &s;o public a Work, I &s;hould renounce my Function this Moment; for with what Face can I pretend to promote a divine Work in the Conver&s;ion of Men, if I cannot have any <HI>&s;atisfying</HI> Knowledge of it, when it appears?

<P>There is an immen&s;e Quantity of Land un&s;ettled to the We&s;tward of <HI>Hanover,</HI> between this and <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippii</HI>-|River; to which People from mo&s;t of the Northern Co|lonies, particularly from <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> and <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> are yearly removing in va&s;t Multitudes.

You may ea&s;ily conjecture I mention this as an Inducement to faithful Mini&s;ters from <HI>New-England</HI> and el&s;ewhere, where they may be &s;pared, to <HI>come into</HI> our <HI>Macedonia to help us.</HI></P>

Tho' the&s;e Congregations have been hitherto de&s;titute of the &s;tated Mini&s;trations of the Go&s;pel; yet the Ite|nerations of my Brethren among them, have been at|tended with very con&s;iderable Succe&s;s. Mr. <HI>Robin&s;on,</HI> as I intimated before, took a Tour thro' the&s;e Frontier Counties, and into <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> about &s;even Years ago. He underwent great Hard&s;hips in <HI>Carolina,</HI> with|out much Succe&s;s, by Rea&s;on of the Fewne&s;s of the In|habitants at that Time; who were generally &s;uch un|cultivated Savages, that there was little Pro&s;pect of
<PB N="34" REF="006657_0033_10297619EAFCE200">doing them much Service without continuing a long Time among them to teach them the fir&s;t Rudiments of Chri&s;tianity; and &s;o &s;cattered, that but very few of them could convene in one Place to hear. The Ca&s;e is indeed happily altered there &s;ince that Time, as the In|habitants are va&s;tly more numerous, and &s;ome Per&s;ons that had a religious Education are &s;ettled among them. A new Congregation, I think upon <HI>Pee-dee River,</HI> &s;ent a Petition to me la&s;t Year to be pre&s;ented to <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> Pre&s;bytery for a Mini&s;ter, &s;ub&s;cribed by more than a
<PB N="35" REF="006657_0034_1029761CF76DFCB8">Hundred Per&s;ons, chiefly Heads of Families; and one of my Corre&s;pondents there informs me, that they are very &s;ufficient to maintain a Mini&s;ter. Our Pre&s;bytery appointed Mr. <HI>James Finley</HI> to vi&s;it them; but by In|di&s;po&s;ition he was prevented; &s;o that they have lain wholly de&s;titute hitherto, and are like to do &s;o, unle&s;s they can obtain &s;ome foreign A&s;&s;i&s;tance, be&s;ides what our Pre&s;bytery can afford them. Be&s;ides this, I hear of &s;undry other Places in <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> that are ripening very fa&s;t for the Go&s;pel: And Oh! that the Lord would <HI>THRUST forth Labourers into that Part of his Harve&s;t;</HI> for I am afraid but few will go thither, 'till they are <HI>thru&s;t</HI> and con&s;trained by an irre&s;i&s;tible Zeal, and a providential Concurrence of Circum&s;tances.&mdash;</P>

Mr. <HI>Robin&s;on</HI> continued, I think, 15 Sabbaths in <HI>Lu|nenburg</HI> and <HI>Amelia,</HI> and left &s;undry &s;piritual Children there behind him. A con&s;iderable Number of <HI>Virgi|nians,</HI> who knew nothing of real Religion before, were awakened by his Mini&s;try; and their Conduct &s;ince gives Ground for a charitable Judgment concern|ing them. Sundry al&s;o that had removed thither from the Northward, and had a religious Education, and a Sy&s;tem of orthodox Principles, were convinced of their unregenerate Condition, and that they had had but a <HI>Form of Godline&s;s without the Power,</HI> who now appear &s;olid Chri&s;tians.&mdash;At their repeated Solicitations, I &s;pent about a Fortnight preaching among them the Beginning of this Month <HI>[June];</HI> and tho' they &s;eem &s;en&s;ibly lan|gui&s;hing for the Want of the Means of Grace, yet &s;un|dry give agreable Evidences of real Religion; and there is a Pro&s;pect of doing much Service, were they furni&s;hed with a faithful Mini&s;ter. I met with mo&s;t Encouragement in a Part of <HI>Amelia</HI> County, where very few had heard any of my Brethren. The A&s;&s;emblies were large even on Week Days, and &s;ometimes there appeared much Solemnity and Affection among them. There appears the greate&s;t Probability, that if they had faithful Preaching frequently, many of them would be turned to the Lord; and it was really afflictive to me, that the Nece&s;&s;ity of my own Congregation con&s;trained me to leave them &s;o &s;oon, and refu&s;e &s;undry Invitations they gave me to preach in other Places in the County. I believe another Congregation would &s;oon be gathered there, had they frequent Preaching.</P>
<P>In <HI>Augusta,</HI> there is a great Number of &s;olid and warm Chri&s;tians; &s;ome of whom were &s;uch when they came thither, &amp; others have experienced a happy Change &s;ince. There was a pretty general Awakening there &s;ome Years ago under the Mini&s;try of Mr. <HI>Dean</HI> (now at Re&s;t) and Mr. <HI>Byram;</HI> the Effects of which in &s;un|dry In&s;tances are &s;till apparent; and the Itinerations of
<PB N="37" REF="006657_0036_102976231C324300">mo&s;t of my Brethren before &amp; &s;ince, have been ble&s;s'd with Succe&s;s. I believe three Mini&s;ters might live very comfortably among them.</P>
<P>I have no general Acquaintance in <HI>Frederic</HI> County, tho' I have pa&s;s'd thro' it, and preached frequently in &s;ome Parts of it: but I am credibly informed by &s;uch of my Brethren as have been often there, that there has been a con&s;iderable Awakening there &s;ome Years ago, which has had a ble&s;&s;ed I&s;&s;ue in many, and that the Congre|gation is in promi&s;ing Circum&s;tances, and has been en|deavouring, tho' un&s;ucce&s;sfully, to obtain a Mini&s;ter, for &s;undry Years.</P>
<P>You will no doubt, be glad to have &s;ome certain In|formation of the State of Religion in <HI>Maryland;</HI> and therefore, tho' I now live at a great Di&s;tance from the Places there where it flouri&s;hes, yet as I preached at mo&s;t of them formerly, when the religious Commotion was at its Height, and as I have heard of no remarka|ble Alterations in them &s;ince, I &s;hall give the following conci&s;e Account; which you may depend upon as true.</P>
<P>There has been a con&s;iderable <HI>Revival</HI> (&s;hall I call it?) or <HI>fir&s;t Plantation</HI> of Religion in <HI>Baltimore</HI> County, which lies along <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI> River, bordering on <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania,</HI> where, I'm informed, Mr. <HI>Whittle&s;ey</HI> (with whom I find, you are acquainted) is like to &s;ettle.&mdash; Of this Mr. <HI>S. Blair,</HI> if I remember rightly, gives an Account in, <HI>The Chri&s;tian Hi&s;tory;</HI> and therefore I &s;hall &s;ay no more of it.</P>
<P>In <HI>Kent</HI> County and <HI>Queen Ann's,</HI> which lie between <HI>Chea&s;apeak</HI> Bay and <HI>Delaware,</HI> a Number of carele&s;s Sinners have been awakened and hopefully brought to Chri&s;t. The Work was begun and chiefly carried on by the In&s;trumentality of that favoured Man Mr. <HI>Ro|bin&s;on;</HI> who&s;e Succe&s;s, whenever I reflect upon it, a&s;to|ni&s;hes me. Oh! he did much in a little Time; and who would not chu&s;e &s;o expeditious a Pilgrimage thro'
<PB N="38" REF="006657_0037_102976263350EEB0">this World? There is in the&s;e Places a con&s;iderable Congregation; and they have made repeated E&s;&s;ays to obtain a &s;ettled Mini&s;ter, but are not like to &s;ucceed 'till our Number is increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>There was a great Stir about Religion in a Place cal|led <HI>Buckingham,</HI> on the Sea-&s;hore, about four Years ago, when I was there; but it was not then come to Matu|rity. It has &s;pread &s;ince, and i&s;&s;ued in a hopeful Con|ver&s;ion in &s;undry In&s;tances; and I am informed they are now &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a Congregation, and are waiting for a Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t glorious Di&s;play of divine Grace in <HI>Maryland</HI> has been in and about <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> County, which lies at &s;ome Di&s;tance from <HI>Chea&s;apeak</HI> Bay on the Ea&s;tern Shore. It began, I think, in the Year 1745, by the Mini&s;try of Mr. <HI>Robin&s;on;</HI> and was afterwards carried on by &s;undry Mini&s;ters that preach'd tran&s;iently there. I was there about two Months, when the Work was at its Height; and I never &s;aw &s;uch a deep and &s;preading Concern among People in my Life as then appeared among them: The A&s;&s;emblies were nume|rous, tho' it was in the Extremity of a cold Winter, and unwearied in attending the Word; and frequently there were very few among them that did not give &s;ome plain Indications of Di&s;tre&s;s or Joy. Oh! the&s;e were the happie&s;t Days that ever my Eyes &s;aw, or are, as I fear, like to &s;ee. Since that, the Harve&s;t &s;eems over there; tho' con&s;iderable Gleanings, I hear, are &s;till gathered; and many of the late Converts give the utmo&s;t Rea&s;on to pre&s;ume their final Per&s;everance. There had been a Congregation of Pre&s;byterians there for many Years; but they were reduced almo&s;t to no|thing before the late Revival; when many of the Church|People were brought under deep Impre&s;&s;ions, and cor|dially joined with them; &s;o that now they form at lea&s;t one large Congregation; and after many friutle&s;s At|tempts, they have lately been &s;o happy as to obtain the

<P>I might, Sir, have been more particular on mo&s;t of Things in this Narrative; but as a <HI>general</HI> View may perhaps be &s;ufficient to you and the Public, and is mo&s;t convenient to me in my pre&s;ent Hurry, I have declined it.&mdash;The indige&s;ted Order and other Inaccuries you will ea&s;ily di&s;cern, are proper Objects for your Can|dour and Genero&s;ity; and I have no other Apology to make, but that the unavoidable Hurry of the Bearer on a Bu&s;ine&s;s of the greate&s;t Importance to the Intere&s;t of Religion in <HI>Virginia,</HI> in which we doubt not of your hearty Concurrence, will not &s;uffer me to tran&s;cribe this fir&s;t Draft.</P>
<P>I &s;hall prize it, dear Sir, as an ine&s;timable Ble&s;&s;ing, if you and others of the Lord's Servants and People in di&s;tant Parts, favour us with the Concurrence of your Prayers to promote the declining Work of Religion among us; which is the only Way I can expect the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of mo&s;t of them.</P>
<P>The Con&s;tancy of your Corre&s;pondence, Sir, affords me peculiar Satisfaction in my pre&s;ent &s;olitary Situation: And if any of the &s;acred Character, in any Parts of the Church where this Narrative may come, &s;hould conde&s;cend to favour me with their Corre&s;pondence, I &s;hould mo&s;t gratefully acknowledge it, and make them the be&s;t Returns in my Power. Our Acquaintance with the State of the Church in various Parts, quali|fies us to adapt our Prayers to it; and therefore &s;uch mutual Intelligences may be of &s;pecial Service to us in our Interce&s;&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>I At fir&s;t intended, Sir, to have &s;aid Nothing of a particular Re&s;traint impos'd upon us at pre&s;ent by the civil Government; le&s;t I &s;hould &s;eem fond of rai&s;ing the Cry of <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> which is very indecent in the Followers of the uncomplaining Lamb of God, e&s;|pecially when there is in Truth &s;o little Occa&s;ion for it; or to fling injurious Reflections on His Maje&s;ty's Coun|cil for this Colony, for whom I have the profounde&s;t Veneration on Account both of their honourable Cha|racter and their Accompli&s;hments for it; and under who&s;e indulgent Admini&s;tration we enjoy &s;o many civil and &s;acred Liberties.</P>
<P>But as I know not, Sir, but this Narrative may come into the Hands of &s;ome who may have &s;ome Influence to &s;ecure our Priviledges, or procure their Enlargement, if it may be judged that we lie under any illegal Re&s;traints; and as the Matter is not only public in this Colony, but has been lately laid before the Government in <HI>England</HI> by the Pre&s;ident &amp; Council, for Advice; I &s;hall venture to give you the following &s;hort, &s;imple Narrative of it; without any tedious Argumentations upon it; and with|out injurious A&s;per&s;ions, which are far from my Heart.</P>
<P>The General Court, as I informed you, have licen&s;ed &s;even Meeting-Hou&s;es for me to officiate in; and I &s;hould not de&s;ire to have their Number and my Fatigues encrea&s;ed, were not the Circum&s;tances of the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Virginia</HI> extraordinary &amp; peculiar. There are a few
<PB N="42" REF="006657_0041_10297633E38A2CD0">of them in &s;undry Counties be&s;ides the&s;e in which the licen&s;ed Hou&s;es are, who are too weak to maintain a Mi|ni&s;ter of their own; and were they never &s;o able, they could not obtain one in the pre&s;ent Scarcity of Mini&s;ters. The&s;e have given me repeated and importunate Invita|tions to come and preach among them; but I judged it imprudent to comply till the Places were legally li|cen&s;ed. Upon this &s;ome of them, with a View to ob|tain my Labours tran&s;iently among them, at lea&s;t on Week Days, and the Vi&s;its of my Brethren in their Iti|nerations, have petitioned the Courts of their re&s;pective Counties for Licen&s;es for Places convenient to them; but they have either been denied, or the Licen&s;e grant|ed by the County Court has been nullified by the Coun|cil; which has di&s;couraged others that they have made no Application. This is a Di&s;advantage to the Peo|ple, not only as they are thereby deprived of the Preach|ing of the Word, but as they are expo&s;ed to the intole|rable Hard&s;hip of carrying their Children &s;o great a Way to be baptized.</P>
<P>The Council has &s;uper&s;eded a Licen&s;e granted by a County Court on the Pre&s;umption, "<HI>That it does not belong to a County Court to proceed in &s;uch Affairs;</HI> and, <HI>That a di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter has no legal Right to more Meet|ing-Hou&s;es than one:</HI>" And the&s;e two Points have been &s;ubmitted to the Determination of tho&s;e to who&s;e Pro|vince it belongs in <HI>England;</HI> but no An&s;wer is yet arriv'd.</P>
<P>The taking the Authority from County Courts of ad|mini&s;tring the legal Qualifications to Mini&s;ters and li|cen&s;ing Meeting-Hou&s;es, would be no great Di&s;advan|tage to us in <HI>Havover,</HI> becau&s;e we might ea&s;ily apply to the Commander in Chief, or the General Court; and therefore 'tis of &s;mall Importance with me how it be de|termined; tho' it would occa&s;ion a con&s;iderable Diffi|culty to tho&s;e that live 2 or 300 Miles di&s;tant from <HI>William&s;burg.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="006657_0042_10297635ADACB020">
But the re&s;training a di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter to but <HI>one</HI> Meeting-Hou&s;e would be a prodigious Grievance to the People in their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances.&mdash;This, Sir, is not a proper Place to debate the Legality of it, nor does it belong to my Province to determine it; yet I may in|offen&s;ively &s;ugge&s;t the following Remarks upon it, as Matters of Speculation to the Curious, and of Determi|nation to tho&s;e in Authority.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's private In&s;tructions with Re&s;pect to Di&s;&s;enters, to the Governour or Commander in Chief, (&s;o far as I can recoliect them from a tran&s;ient View, which the Hon. Col. LEE, our late Pre&s;ident favoured me with) run thus <HI>verhatim,</HI>
<Q>You are to tolerate all Di&s;&s;enters (except Papi&s;ts) who lead quiet and in|offen&s;ive Lives</Q>&mdash;But how can &s;uch Di&s;&s;enters be tolerated, who by Rea&s;on of Weakne&s;s and the Scarcity of Mini&s;ters, cannot obtain a Mini&s;ter of their own, un|le&s;s they may legally &s;hare in the Labours of a Mini&s;ter with other Places, which cannot be without a Plurality of Meeting-Hou&s;es under the Care of one Mini&s;ter?</P>

<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">This Act was received <HI>An, quart.

<P><PB N="44" REF="006657_0043_10297638B8998468">
Father; The &s;aid Act expre&s;ly &s;ays,&mdash;<Q>That all the Laws made and provided for the frequenting of divine Service on the Lord's-Day, commonly called <HI>Sunday,</HI> &s;hall be &s;till in Force, and executed again&s;t all Per&s;ons that offend again&s;t the &s;aid Laws, except &s;uch Per&s;ons come to &s;ome Congregation or A&s;&s;em|bly of religious Wor&s;hip, allowed or permitted by this Act.</Q> But how can Per&s;ons come to &s;uch Con|gregation or A&s;&s;embly, unle&s;s a Place within their Reach be licen&s;ed for that Purpo&s;e? If this Liberty be denied them, are they not obliged, according to <HI>the Act of To|leration</HI> it &s;elf, to attend con&s;tantly on Wor&s;hip in the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church? And if &s;o, where is their Toleration?</P>
<P>Finally; It is a very common Thing in this Colony, and allowed expre&s;ly by Law, that where the Pari&s;h is of great Extent, and cannot be divided into &s;undry, each of them capable to maintain a Mini&s;ter, to erect 2, 3 or 4 Churches or Chappels of Ea&s;e, for the Conveniency of the Pari&s;h, where the Mini&s;ter officiates alternately, or in Proportion to the Number of People: And &s;ince the Rea&s;on for a Plurality of Meeting-Hou&s;es among us, is the &s;ame; why is it not equally legal?&mdash;Sundry under Things might be &s;ugge&s;ted; but I forbear.</P>
