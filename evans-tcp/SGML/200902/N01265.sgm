<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE De&s;ign of the ESSAY we are upon, is, <HI>To Do Good in the world;</HI> and very Particularly, among <HI>Younger Per&s;ons of the Female Sex;</HI> who&s;e Improvement in Piety, would not be <HI>too much</HI> Studied, if there were <HI>much more</HI> Study Employ'd than there is upon it.</P>
<P>I am able to &s;ay, on the behalf of this <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> That I have a &s;mall Army of Neighbours Importunately calling upon me for it; A good number who tell me, tis pity &s;uch <HI>Piety</HI> &s;hou'd have <HI>two Burials;</HI> one in the <HI>Grave;</HI> 'tother in <HI>Oblivion:</HI> And it is a very allowable thing to gratify their <HI>Importunity.</HI> But this is a &s;ort of a <HI>Thread-bare Apology,</HI> which I have no va|lue for; I have ca&s;t it off a great while ago. It &s;ignifies nothing, if the Things Publi&s;hed upon it, are not for <HI>the Service of Mankind.</HI> And if they are <HI>&s;o,</HI> [as, Reader, I hope, what thou ha&s;t before thee, will be!] there needs neither <HI>That,</HI> nor any other Apology at all, for their Publication.</P>
<P>I have not Complemented the Memory of the Decea&s;ed Per&s;on; or treated her, as a <HI>Ba|&s;il</HI> his <HI>Julitta,</HI> a <HI>Ny&s;&s;en</HI> his <HI>Pulcheria,</HI> a <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> his <HI>Pelagia,</HI> and a <HI>Jerom</HI> his <HI>Marcella.</HI> Nor have I been labouring to make an Addition unto <HI>Beverovicius</HI>'s Catalogue, of, <HI>Women that
<PB REF="001508_0003_0FB380365E266A10">
have been Con&s;iderable.</HI> I have only <HI>Shown</HI> &s;ome of the <HI>Garments of Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> I will not &s;o much &s;ay, <HI>Made</HI> by a Younger <HI>Dorcas;</HI> (only that the <HI>Needle-work</HI> of her <HI>Pen</HI> was Employ'd thereupon:) but <HI>Worn</HI> by her, and <HI>Made,</HI> I &s;hould rather &s;ay, by the <HI>Good Spirit of Grace,</HI> who&s;e internal <HI>Raiment of Needle-work,</HI> renders the <HI>Daughters</HI> of the LORD, <HI>all Glorious within.</HI> The Account, I hope, is <HI>Modest;</HI> and without <HI>Flouri&s;h;</HI> And every thing in the world for|born, but what was thought might be <HI>&V;&s;eful.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Lamp</HI> found in <HI>Tulliola</HI>'s Tomb, was not of &s;o much u&s;e, as that <HI>Shining Piety,</HI> which is in &s;uch Papers, as we find in a little Trunk of a Young <HI>Agatha</HI> departed from us. We are with a mighty Advantage told, <HI>what &s;hould be done,</HI> when we are at the &s;ame time &s;hown, <HI>what has been done,</HI> in a cour&s;e of Piety.</P>
<P>The Sorrow on the Death of &s;uch a Chri|&s;tian, is marvellou&s;ly Extingui&s;hed, by &s;uch <HI>Reliques!</HI> O <HI>Rome,</HI> How preferrible to thy boa&s;ted <HI>Reliques!</HI> I had almo&s;t &s;aid, Every <HI>Sorrowful Tear</HI> is a &s;ort of a <HI>Sadducee.</HI></P>
<P>And the &s;atisfaction of having <HI>Done Good,</HI> by Exhibiting the <HI>Memorials of Piety</HI> left by &s;uch a <HI>Christian,</HI> will be an abundant com|pen&s;ation, for all the Obloquy, of &s;ome En|vious People, who are of another, and a well known Character.</P>
<P>It was a peculiar Honour to <HI>Shallum,</HI> Neh. III. 12. That <HI>he and his Daughters,</HI> did more than a little to build up the <HI>City of God.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>MEMOIRS</HI> OF <HI>Mrs.</HI> Jeru&s;ha Oliver, Who Died, 30. <HI>d.</HI> 10. <HI>m.</HI> 1710.</HEAD>
<P N="1">&sect; 1. ABOUT the middle of the former Century, there died at <HI>Norwich</HI> in Great <HI>Britain,</HI> one of the Female Sex, &amp; of no very con&s;iderable Quality, in the Thirtieth Year of her Age; who left behind her a <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of her <HI>Faith,</HI> and a <HI>Relation</HI> of her <HI>Experience,</HI> with &s;ome other grateful &amp; u&s;eful Remembrances of her Piety. The famous Dr. <HI>John Collings,</HI> thought it worth his while, to Publi&s;h tho&s;e <HI>Memorials,</HI> with a Sermon of his own, which he Entitles; <HI>The Life and Death of a true Chri&s;tian; deciphered
<PB N="2" REF="001508_0005_0FB3803DD2A59328">
in a Sermon, at the Burial of</HI> Mary Simp|&s;on, <HI>a Religious Young Maid, lately Living in the City of Norwich.</HI></P>
<P>There has lately Died in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> one of the Female Sex, as con&s;iderably Cir|cum&s;tanced; who had not attained unto that Age by &s;everal Years; but who has left behind her, as Memorable Te&s;ti|monies of her Piety, which may prove as Grateful and U&s;eful to many Sur|vivers; and I am de&s;ired by many, to make a brief <HI>Collection</HI> of them. Tho' the <HI>Collector</HI> &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed never &s;o nearly Related unto the Per&s;on De|cea&s;ed, yet while he forbears every thing that looks like Flouri&s;h and Applau&s;e upon her Character, and gives but a bare Tran&s;cript, and Extract of tho&s;e <HI>Memoirs,</HI> which her own Pen had pro|vided, it is to be hoped, that many, e&s;pecially Young Per&s;ons, and of the Female Sex, may Enjoy the Benefit of the&s;e things, without any Invidious Re|proaches upon the offer of them. <HI>Na|zianzen</HI> began his Funeral Oration upon his Decea&s;ed Si&s;ter <HI>Gorgonia,</HI> with a &s;hort An&s;wer to all Cavil again&s;t &s;o <HI>Dome&s;tick

<P N="2">&sect; 2. THE Young Gentlewoman, who is now (as I have told you,) to <HI>Write,</HI> rather than to be <HI>Written</HI> of, was Born at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>N. E. April</HI> 16. 1684. a Daughter of Dr. IN|CREASE MATHER; And in &s;o &s;ay|ing, I have &s;ufficiently intimated, what Education was be&s;tow'd upon her. The Reverend Mr. <HI>Richard Mather</HI> of <HI>Dor|che&s;ter,</HI> and (by the Mothers &s;ide) Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> the for ever Famous Teacher of the Church fir&s;t in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> were her Grand-fathers. She wanted not for good Sen&s;e; and as &s;he was betimes a <HI>Good Reader,</HI> &s;o by being a <HI>Great Reader</HI> ever &s;ince, Four Years Old, in <HI>Hi&s;torical</HI> Books, as well as <HI>Theological,</HI> &s;he furni&s;hed her mind with a &s;tock of many Valu|able
<PB N="4" REF="001508_0007_0FB38045CEAB7288">
Trea&s;ures. But the <HI>Early Fear of God,</HI> was the mo&s;t Valuable of all the things that Enriched her; and not the lea&s;t Ob&s;ervable. <HI>Secret Prayer</HI> was an Exerci&s;e of her <HI>Infancy;</HI> The <HI>Fear of Sin,</HI> had a &s;trong Influence upon her; And e&s;pecially &s;he &s;o fear'd a <HI>Lye,</HI> that &s;he then began a Cu&s;tom &s;he never left off; to Avoid <HI>Po&s;itive</HI> Expre&s;&s;ions, but rather to &s;ay, <HI>I think,</HI> or, <HI>It may be,</HI> or, <HI>Tis likely;</HI> even in things that &s;he was mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured of. So <HI>Dutiful</HI> &s;he was to her <HI>Parents,</HI> that I have &s;een it a&s;&s;erted un|der their Hand; <HI>She never gave occa&s;ion to them, to be once Angry with her, through|out the whole Cour&s;e of her Life!</HI> What &s;he was in her <HI>Infancy,</HI> one might a little infer, from a <HI>Catalogue of her Sins,</HI> which her Penitent Soul drew up, as &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing out of that Age, and yet &s;carce Entring into the Years which we call the <HI>Teens.</HI> Her <HI>Catalogue</HI> does con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch &s;trokes as the&s;e; <HI>What Sins have I been guilty of! O my Sins have been very many! &mdash; My Prayers have been &s;leighty: And I have &s;pent my Time very unprofitably, And I have Read the Holy Word of God &s;leightily. And I have Heard the Word
<PB N="5" REF="001508_0008_0FB3804755ABA738">
of God &s;ometimes, not with &s;o much Dili|gence as I &s;hould have done. And &s;ome|times I have not attended upon Hearing of Prayer as I &s;hould have done. And I have been Proud. And I have been Unthankful. And &s;ometimes I have not Obeyed my Fa|ther and my Mother as I ought to have done. And I have Eaten things, which were hurt|ful for me to Eat; And I have Eat more than I have had need to have done. And I have been afraid to go alone to Pray. I u&s;ed to Pray, when I was a bed. Tho&s;e were Lazy Prayers indeed! I have omitted tho&s;e Duties of Meditation and Self-Exami|nation. And I have &s;ometimes omitted to ask a Ble&s;&s;ing of God, when I have been go|ing to Eat; and to give Thanks, when I had done Eating. And I have Performed this Duty &s;leightily. And I have been Guilty of one Sin, which is greater than all the&s;e; That is, Unbelief. And be&s;ides all this, there is that Sin of Sins, my Original Sin; My Nature is Sinful.</HI> Thus wrote <HI>Jeru&s;ha,</HI> while her <HI>Infancy</HI> was hardly yet Ex|pired. The&s;e were the wor&s;t Things that &s;he could Charge upon her &s;elf, when &s;he was then making her E&s;&s;ays
<PB N="6" REF="001508_0009_0FB38048594ECE38">
towards the <HI>well-grown Devotions,</HI> of no le&s;s than <HI>Whole Days,</HI> of Retirement, for the <HI>Humiliations</HI> of a Repenting Soul. O more Aged Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion; To what a <HI>Tenderne&s;s</HI> in your <HI>walk with God,</HI> will you be Awakened; when you &s;ee a <HI>Child,</HI> Reflecting with all the Bitter|ne&s;s of <HI>Repentance,</HI> on mi&s;carriages which few, few among the Children of men, have any <HI>Trouble</HI> for, take any <HI>Notice</HI> of!</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. WHen &s;he was Twelve Years old, the <HI>Re&s;olutions of Piety</HI> in her were arrived unto &s;uch a Fixa|tion and E&s;tabli&s;hment, that &s;he came to a very Solemn Tran&s;action with the Glorious GOD. She Entred into His COVENANT; and &s;he did with all po&s;&s;ible Solemnity &s;et her Hand unto an In&s;trument for that purpo&s;e, which appears to have been very much her own Drawing up: tho' &s;he had a well-known Copy of another before her.

And, O mo&s;t Holy Lord God, wilt thou be plea&s;ed to Accept of me? Yea, Lord, I know, thou wilt accept of me, if I do Sin|cerely Give my &s;elf to Thee in CHRIST. Then, O Lord, I Pray thee, for the Sake of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, Be at Peace with me. O Lord, I have fallen from thee, by my Sins, and I am by Nature, a Child of Hell. But thou, O Lord, of thy Infinite Mercy ha&s;t offered to be my God. There|fore I come unto thee, and I Renounce my Sins; and, with thy Grace inabling me, I will For&s;ake them. I have been Serving thine Enemies, and Forgetting the God that has dealt very Mercifully with me. But now, O Lord, I will Endeavour to Serve thee; And I will not allow my &s;elf in any known Sin; and I will u&s;e the Means, which I know, thou ha&s;t appointed &s;o the De&s;truction of my Corruptions. I here give my Heart unto thee; O Lord, I Pray thee to give me a New Heart. And I de&s;ire Grace from thee, that when thou &s;halt call me thereto, I may part with all that is dear unto me in the World, rather than turn from thee to the ways of Sin.

I do here al&s;o Accept of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as the only way, by which Sinners may have Acce&s;s to thee. And I do here joyn my &s;elf in a <HI>Marriage-Covenant</HI> with Him. O Lord, JESUS, I come unto thee, a mo&s;t loth&s;ome Creature. Who am I, that I &s;hould be <HI>Married</HI> unto the King of Glory!

<P>This Tran&s;action was on a <HI>Twentieth Day of February,</HI> 1696. And in the re|maining Years of her Life, con&s;tantly, as the <HI>Twentieth Day of February</HI> arrived.
<PB N="9" REF="001508_0012_0FB3804CD8950F70">
it was her Practice, to Review her COVENANT, and Bewayl her Sins a|gain&s;t it, and Fly to the <HI>Blood of the E|verla&s;ting Covenant</HI> for the Pardon of them, and Renew her Holy Re&s;oluti|ons to Live yet more Watchfully and Fruitfully, &amp; Implore the A&s;&s;i&s;tences of Heaven to perform what &s;he Re&s;olved.</P>
<P>I will only Single out One or Two of tho&s;e Commemorations, from her Memorials: February 20. 1703. <HI>It is this Day Seven years, &s;ince I did make a Co|venant with God; in which Covenant, I did take the Lord Jehovah, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, for my Portion and Best Good; and did Promi&s;e to For&s;ake Sin, and to Endeavour to Serve God; And did Ac|cept of Chri&s;t, for my Head &amp; Husband, and did Embrace Him in all His Offices. The Lord Pardon my not being &s;o Sincere in, and &s;o Faithful to, that Covenant, as I ought to have been, and make me Sincere in it, and Faithful to it; And Pardon all my Sins; keep me from Sin; and that for the Sake of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>At another time. Feb. 20. <HI>This Day Twelve years ago, I did very Explicitely
<PB N="10" REF="001508_0013_0FB38052D0AE5708">
enter into Covenant with God. The Lord Pardon my not being &s;o Sincere in, and &s;o Mindful of, and &s;o Faithful to, that Cove|nant, as I ought to have been, and make me Sincere, and Mindful, and Faithful; And make me very Thankful unto that God, who has not cut me down for my Unfruitfulne&s;s, but has &s;pared me, not for Three Years only, but Four times Three Years, notwith&s;tanding my Covenant-breaking. And the Lord &s;pare me &s;till, for the Sake of the Sacrifice of Chri&s;t, and grant that I may receive tho&s;e continual Supplies of Grace and Strength from the Spi|rit of Chri&s;t, that I want, and grant, that the Holy Spirit may Po&s;&s;e&s;s me, and fill me with Good Thoughts, and Good De&s;ires, and Good Re&s;olutions, and Good Actions; and grant that I may Glorify God as long as I Live; and grant that my Death may be Happy &amp; Joyful; and that for the Sake of my Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>That She might go on, with a more <HI>Confirmed Piety,</HI> when &s;he was near Six|teen years old, She joyned unto the Church, of which her Father and her Brother are the <HI>Pa&s;tors;</HI> and Exhibited unto the Church, an Acceptable <HI>Decla|ration</HI>

of her Faith &amp; Repentance; and at the Table of the Lord, <HI>Seal'd</HI> the <HI>Co|venant,</HI> in the way of His Appointment.</P>
<P>I think it my Duty to interpo&s;e my Advice unto the Young Readers, on this occa&s;ion. I fear, I fear, that the Action of <HI>Entring into Covenant with God,</HI> is too often done, with a little too much of the Strain of the <HI>Old Covenant.</HI> And for this very Cau&s;e, the Lord often leaves His <HI>Covenanting,</HI> and really Regenerate Children, to Some Remarkable <HI>Falls into Sin</HI> afterwards, that He may drive them into more <HI>Evangelical Terms,</HI> and make them &s;en&s;ible that it is not a <HI>Co|venant of Works,</HI> but a <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> wherein they are to draw near unto Him. I make no doubt, that the Pro|po&s;als of the Two Pious <HI>Alleines,</HI> and <HI>Janeway,</HI> and <HI>Guthry,</HI> and others, for, <HI>Explicit Covenanting with God,</HI> yea, <HI>Wri|ting</HI> and <HI>Signing</HI> the In&s;trument, have been a mighty Service to Religion, in very many Thou&s;ands of Chri&s;tians, as they were in our <HI>Jeru&s;ha.</HI> Yet <HI>I will &s;hew you mine Opinion.</HI> The <HI>Form</HI> u&s;ed by tho&s;e Men of God, is hardly
<PB N="12" REF="001508_0015_0FB3805736A2A220">
quite <HI>Evangelical</HI> enough. I would propo&s;e, that the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> which is all over, <HI>Grace, Grace;</HI> be thoroughly con&s;idered by them who do this Action; and that the Terms of, <HI>I Confe&s;s,</HI> and, <HI>I Con&s;ent,</HI> and, <HI>I De&s;ire,</HI> be preferred, unto, <HI>I Will;</HI> as Language be&s;t Suiting the Nature &amp; the Tenour of a <HI>Covenant,</HI> in which, tis not by <HI>Do|ing,</HI> but by <HI>Receiving,</HI> that we arrive un|to Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, and that our Holy <HI>Re&s;o|lutions</HI> be form'd, as points of <HI>Thankful|ne&s;s</HI> to the Lord from whom we <HI>Receive</HI> the Gift of <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and as parts of our Promi&s;ed Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; and the &s;tyle thereof be, <HI>O my God, I ask of thee, that thou wilt give me the Grace to do &s;uch and &s;uch things!</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Febr.</HI> 20. 1709. She remembers that it was then Thirteen years &s;ince &s;he had thus given her &s;elf to God, and has &s;erious and holy Reflections on it: She did not Live to another <HI>20th.</HI> of <HI>February.</HI></P>

<P>It is no Unu&s;ual Thing, for Pray|ing Ones, who have been much <HI>Afraid of Death,</HI> in the time of their Health, to be Strangely carried above it, as their <HI>Death</HI> approaches. Our <HI>Jeru&s;ha</HI> had an Excellent Grand-mother, (her Fa|thers Mother,) who was One Remar|kable In&s;tance of this Ob&s;ervation.

Neverthele&s;s, She was for many years much afraid of Dying; and particu|larly fearful, that the <HI>Pangs of Death</HI> would prove terrible, and very grievous and painful.
