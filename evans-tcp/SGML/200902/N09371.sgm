<P>AS mankind from one parent are divided into many fami|lies, and as trading to &s;ea is greatly increa&s;ed within a few ages pa&s;t; amid&s;t this extended commerce how nece&s;&s;ary is it that the profe&s;|&s;ed followers of Chri&s;t keep &s;acred his holy name, and be employed about trade and traffick no far|ther than ju&s;tice and equity evi|dently accompanies? that we may give no ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence to any, however di&s;tant, or unable to plead their own cau&s;e; and may conti|nually keep in view, the &s;preading of the true and &s;aving knowledge of God, and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, among&s;t our fellow creatures, which through his infinite love &s;ome feel to be more precious than any other trea&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER I.</HI> On &s;erving the Lord in our outward Employments.</HEAD>
<P>UNDER the humbling di&s;pen&s;ations of the Father of mercies, I have felt <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> inward labour for the good of my fellow creatures, and a concern that the holy &s;pirit, which alone can re&s;tore mankind to a &s;tate of true harmony, may with &s;inglene&s;s of heart be waited for and followed.</P>
<P>I TRUST there are many under that vi|&s;itation, which if faithfully attended to will make them quick of under&s;tanding in the
<PB N="4" REF="011948_0003_0F8788778E3FA4E0">
fear of the Lord, and qualify with firmne&s;s to be true patterns of the Chri&s;tian life, who in living and walking may hold forth an in|vitation to others, to come out of the entan|glements of the &s;pirit of this world.</P>
<P>AND that which I feel fir&s;t to expre&s;s is, a care for tho&s;e who are in circum&s;tances, which appear difficult, with re&s;pect to &s;up|porting their families in a way an&s;werable to pure wi&s;dom, that they may not be di&s;|couraged, but remember that in humbly obeying the leading of Chri&s;t, he owneth us as his friends, <HI>Ye are my friends if ye do what|&s;oever I command you;</HI> and to be a friend to Chri&s;t, is to be united to him, who hath all power in heaven and in earth; and though a woman may forget her &s;ucking child, yet will he not forget his faithful ones.</P>
<P>THE condition of many who dwell in ci|ties hath often affected me with a brotherly &s;ympathy, attended with a de&s;ire that re&s;ig|nation may be laboured for; and where the holy leader directeth to a country life or &s;ome change of employ, he may be faithfully followed; for under the refining hand of the Lord I have &s;een that the inhabitants of &s;ome cities are greatly increa&s;ed through &s;ome branches of bu&s;ine&s;s which his holy &s;pi|rit doth not lead into, and that being entan|gled in the&s;e things, tends to bring a cloud over the minds of people convinced of the leadings of this holy leader, and ob&s;tructs
<PB N="5" REF="011948_0003_0F8788778E3FA4E0">
the coming of the kingdom of Chri&s;t on earth as it is in heaven.</P>
<P>NOW if we indulge a de&s;ire to imitate our neighbours in tho&s;e things which harmoni&s;e not with the true Chri&s;tian walking, the&s;e entanglements may hold fa&s;t to us, and &s;ome, who in an awakening time, feel tender &s;cruples, with re&s;pect to their manner of life, may look on the example of others more no|ted in the church, who yet may not be re|fined from every degree of dro&s;s; and by looking on the&s;e examples, and de&s;iring to &s;upport their families in a way plea&s;ant to the natural mind, there may be danger of the worldly wi&s;dom gaining &s;trength in them, and of their departure from that pure feeling of truth, which if faithfully attend|ed to, would teach contentment in the di|vine will, even in a very low e&s;tate.</P>
<P>ONE formerly &s;peaking on the profita|blene&s;s of true humility &s;aith, <Q>He that troubles not him&s;elf with anxious tho'ts for more than is nece&s;&s;ary, lives little le&s;s than the life of Angels, whil&s;t by a mind content with little, he imitates their want of nothing. Cave's prim. Chri&s;ti. page 31.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IT is not enough, &s;ays Tertullian, that a Chri&s;tian be cha&s;te and mode&s;t, but he mu&s;t appear to be &s;o: a virtue of which he &s;hould have &s;o a great &s;tore, that it &s;hould flow from his mind upon his habit,
<PB N="6" REF="011948_0004_0F8788785CEA34D8">
and break from the retirements of his con&s;cience, into the &s;uperficies of his life. Same book, page 43.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE garments we wear, &s;ays Clemens, ought to be mean and frugal&mdash;that is true &s;implicity of habit, which takes away what is vain and &s;uperfluous; that the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olid garment, which is the farthe&s;t from curio&s;ity. Page 49.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH the change from day to night, is by a motion &s;o gradual as &s;carcely to be perceived, yet when night is come we be|hold it very different from the day; and thus as people become wi&s;e in their own eyes, and prudent in their own &s;ight; cu&s;toms ri&s;e up from the &s;pirit of this world, and &s;pread by little and little, till a departure from the &s;implicity that there is in Chri&s;t, becomes as di&s;tingui&s;hable as light from darkne&s;s, to &s;uch who are crucified to the world.</P>
<P>OUR holy Shepherd, to encourage his flock in firmne&s;s and per&s;everance, reminds them of his love for them, <HI>As the Father hath loved me, &s;o have I loved you; continue ye in my love;</HI> and in another place graciou&s;ly points out the danger of departing therefrom, by going into un&s;uitable employments; this he repre&s;ents in the &s;imilitude of offence from that u&s;eful active member, the hand; and to fix the in&s;truction the deeper, names the right hand, <HI>If thy right hand offend thee cut it off and ca&s;t it from thee</HI>&mdash;If thou feele&s;t of|fence
<PB N="7" REF="011948_0004_0F8788785CEA34D8">
in thy employment, humbly follow him who leads into all truth, and is a &s;trong and faithful friend to tho&s;e who are re&s;igned to him.</P>
<P>AGAIN, he points out tho&s;e things which appearing plea&s;ant to the natural mind, are not be&s;t for us, in the &s;imilitude of offence from the eye, <HI>If thy right eye offend thee pluck it out, and ca&s;t it from thee.</HI> To pluck out the eye, or cut off the hand, is attended with &s;harp pain; and how precious is the in&s;tructi|on which our Redeemer thus opens to us, that we may not faint under the mo&s;t pain|ful trials, but put our tru&s;t in him, even in him who &s;ent an Angel to feed Elijah in the wilderne&s;s; who fed a multitude with a few barley loaves, and is now as attentive to the wants of his people as ever.</P>
<P>THE prophet I&s;aiah, repre&s;ents the un|righteous doings of the I&s;raelites toward the poor, as the fruits of an effeminate life, <HI>As for my people, children are their oppre&s;&s;ors, and women rule over them; what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor, &s;aith the Lord God.</HI> Then he men|tions the haughtine&s;s of the daughters of Sion, and enumerates many ornaments, as in&s;tances of their vanity, to uphold which, the poor were &s;o hardly dealt with, that he &s;ets forth their poverty, their leanne&s;s and in|ability to help them&s;elves, in the &s;imilitude of a man maimed by violence or <HI>beaten to</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="011948_0005_0F8788798AF98E18">
and forced to endure the painful operation of having his face gradually worn away in the manner of grinding.</P>
<P>AND I may here add, that at times, when I have felt true love open my heart towards my fellow creatures, and been engaged in weighty conver&s;ation in the cau&s;e of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, the in&s;tructions I have received un|der the&s;e exerci&s;es, in regard to the true u&s;e of the outward gifts of God, have made deep and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions on my mind.</P>
<P>I HAVE here beheld, how the de&s;ire to provide wealth, and to uphold a delicate life hath grievou&s;ly entangled many, and been like &s;nares to their ofspring; and though &s;ome have been affected with a &s;en&s;e of their difficulties, and appeared de&s;irous, at times, to be helped out of them; yet for want of abiding under the humbling power of truth, they have continued in the&s;e entangle|ments; for in remaining comformable to this world, and giving way to a delicate life, this expen&s;ive way of living, in parents and in children, hath called for a large &s;upply, and in an&s;wering this call <HI>the faces of the poor</HI> have been ground away, and made thin through hard dealing.</P>
<P>THERE is balm, there is a phy&s;ician! and O what longings do I feel! that we may em|brace the means appointed for our healing, know that removed which now mini&s;ters cau&s;e for the cries of many people to a&s;cend
<PB N="9" REF="011948_0005_0F8788798AF98E18">
to heaven again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors, and that we may &s;ee the true harmony re&s;tored.</P>
<P>BEHOLD <HI>how good and how plea&s;ant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity.</HI> The na|ture of this unity is thus opened by the apo&s;tle, <HI>If we walk in the light, as Chri&s;t is in the light, we &s;hall have fellow&s;hip one with another, and the blood of Chri&s;t will clean&s;e us from all &s;in.</HI></P>
<P>THE land may be polluted with inno|cent blood, which like the blood of Abel may cry to the Almighty; but tho&s;e who <HI>walk in the light as Chri&s;t is in the light,</HI> they know the <HI>lamb of God, who taketh away &s;in.</HI></P>
<P>WALKING is a phra&s;e frequently u&s;ed in &s;cripture, to repre&s;ent our journey through life, and appears to comprehend the various affairs and tran&s;actions properly relating to our being in this world.</P>
<P>CHRIST being the light, dwells always in the light, and if our walking be thus, and in every affair and concern we faithfully fol|low this divine leader; he pre&s;erves from giving ju&s;t cau&s;e for any to quarrel with us; and where this foundation is laid and mutu|ally kept to, by families conver&s;ant with each other, the way is open far the&s;e com|forts in &s;ociety, which our heavenly father intends as a part of our happine&s;s in this world; and then we may experience the goodne&s;s, and plea&s;antne&s;s of dwelling to|gether in unity; but where ways of living
<PB N="10" REF="011948_0006_0F87887A2C51AC30">
take place, which tend to oppre&s;&s;ion, and in the pur&s;uit of wealth, people do that to others which they know would not be ac|ceptable to them&s;elves, either in exerci&s;ing an ab&s;olute power over them, or otherwi&s;e laying on them unequitable burdens; here a fear le&s;t that mea&s;ure &s;hould be meeted to them, which they have mea&s;ured to others, incites a care to &s;upport that by craft and cunning devices which &s;tands not on the firm foundation of righteou&s;ne&s;e: thus the harmony of &s;ociety is broken, and from hence commotions and wars do frequently ari&s;e in the world.</P>
<P>COME <HI>out of Babylon my people, that ye be not partakers of her &s;ins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</HI> Rev. xv. 3, 4. This Babel, or Babylon, was built in the &s;pirit of &s;elf-ex|altation; <HI>Let us build us a city and a tower, who&s;e top may reach to heaven, and let us make us a name.</HI> Gen. xi. 4. In departing from an humble tru&s;t in God, and following a &s;elf|i&s;h &s;pirit, people have intentions to get the upperhand of their fellow creatures, pri|vately meditate on means to obtain their ends, have a language in their hearts which is hard to under&s;tand. In Babel the lan|guage is confounded.</P>
<P>THIS city is repre&s;ented as a place of bu&s;i|ne&s;s and tho&s;e employed in it, as merchants of the earth: <HI>The merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delica|cies.</HI> Rev. xviii. 3.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="011948_0006_0F87887A2C51AC30">AND it is remarkable in this call, that the language from the father of mercies is, my people, <HI>Come out of Babylon my people!</HI> Thus his tender mercies are toward us in an imperfect &s;tate; and as we faithfully at|tend to the call, the path of righteou&s;ne&s;s is more and more opened; cravings, which have not their foundation in pure wi&s;dom, more and more cea&s;e; and in an inward pu|rity of heart, we experience a re&s;toration of that which was lo&s;t at Babel, repre&s;ented by the in&s;pired prophet in the <HI>returning of a pure language.</HI> Zep. iii. 9.</P>
<P>HAPPY for them who humbly attend to the call, <HI>Come out of Babylon my people.</HI> For though in going forth we may meet with tryals, which for a time may be painful, yet as we bow in true humility, and continue in it, an evidence is felt that God only is wi&s;e; and that in weaning us from all that is &s;elfi&s;h he prepares the way to a quiet habitation where all our de&s;ires are bounded by his wi&s;dom. And an exerci&s;e of &s;pirit attends me, that we who are convinced of the pure leadings of truth, may bow in the deepe&s;t reverence, and &s;o watchfully regard this lea|der, that m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> who are grievou&s;ly entan|gled in a wilderne&s;s of vain cu&s;toms, may look upon us, and be in&s;tructed. And O that &s;uch who have plenty of this world's goods, may be faithful in that with which they are entru&s;ted! and example others in the true chri&s;tian walking.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="011948_0007_0F87887B9D6F8D90">OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, &s;peaking on world|ly greatne&s;s, compares him&s;elf to one wait|ing and attending on a company at dinner: <HI>Whether is greater, he that &s;itteth at meat or he that &s;erveth? Is not he that &s;itteth at meat? but I am among&s;t you as he that &s;erveth.</HI> Luke xxii. 27.</P>
<P>THUS in a world greatly di&s;ordered, where men a&s;piring to outward greatne&s;s were wont to oppre&s;s others to &s;upport their de&s;igns, he who was of the highe&s;t de&s;cent, being the Son of God, and greater than any among&s;t the greate&s;t families of men, by his example and doctrines foreclo&s;ed his followers from claiming any &s;hew of outward greatne&s;s, from any &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uperiority in them&s;elves, or derived from their ance&s;tors.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> On the Example of CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>AS my mind hath been brought into a brotherly feeling with the poor, as to the things of this life, who are under tryals in regard to getting a living in a way an|&s;werable to the purity of truth; a labour of heart hath attended me, that their way may not be made difficult through the love of mo|ney in tho&s;e who are tryed with plentiful e&s;tates, but that they with tenderne&s;s of heart may &s;ympathize with them.</P>
<P>IT was the &s;aying of our ble&s;&s;ed Re|deemer, <HI>Ye cannot &s;erve God and mammon.</HI> There is a deep feeling of the way of purity, a way in which the wi&s;dom of the world hath no part, but is opened by the &s;pirit of truth, and is <HI>called the way of holine&s;s;</HI> a way in which the traveller is employed in watching unto prayer; and the outward gain we get in this journey is con&s;idered as a tru&s;t com|mitted to us, by HIM who formed and &s;up|ports
<PB N="14" REF="011948_0008_0F87887C06742150">
the world; and is the rightful director of the u&s;e and application of the product of it.</P>
<P>NOW except the mind be pre&s;erved cha&s;te, there is no &s;afety for us; but in an e&s;trange|ment from true re&s;ignation, the &s;pirit of the world ca&s;ts up a way, in which gain is many times principally attended to, and in which there is a &s;elfi&s;h application of outward trea|&s;ures.</P>
<P>HOW agreeable to the true harmony of &s;o|ciety, is that exhortation of the Apo&s;tle? <HI>Look not every man on his own things, but every man al&s;o on the things of others. Let this mind be in you which was al&s;o in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>A PERSON in outward pro&s;perity may have the power of obtaining riches, but the &s;ame mind being in him which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, he may feel a tenderne&s;s of heart towards tho&s;e of low degree; and in&s;tead of &s;etting him&s;elf above them, may look upon it as an unmerited favour, that his way through life is more ea&s;y than the way of many others; may improve every opportunity of leading forth out of tho&s;e cu&s;toms which have en|tangled the family; employ his time in look|ing into the wants of the poor members, and hold forth &s;uch a perfect example of humi|liation, that the pure witne&s;s may be reach|ed in many minds; and the way opened for a harmonious walking together.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="011948_0008_0F87887C06742150">JESUS CHRIST, in promoting the happi|ne&s;s of others, was not deficient in looking for the helple&s;s, who lay in ob&s;curity, nor did he &s;ave any thing to render him&s;elf ho|nourable among&s;t men, which might have been of more u&s;e to the weak members in his Father's family; of who&s;e compa&s;|&s;ion towards us I may now &s;peak a little. He who was perfectly happy in him&s;elf, mov|ed with infinite love, <HI>took not upon him the na|ture of Angels,</HI> but our imperfect natures, and therein wre&s;tled with the temptations which attend us in this life; and being the Son of HIM who is greater than earthly Princes, yet became a companion to poor, &s;incere heart|ed men; and though he gave the cleare&s;t evidence that divine power attended him, yet the mo&s;t unfavourable con&s;tructions were framed by a &s;elf righteous people; tho&s;e miracles repre&s;ented as the effect of a diabolical power, and endeavours u&s;ed to render him hateful, as having his mi&s;&s;ion from the prince of darkne&s;s; nor did their en|vy cea&s;e till they took him like a criminal and brought him to tryal. Though &s;ome may affect to carry the appearance of being unmoved at the apprehen&s;ion of di&s;tre&s;s, our dear Redeemer, who was perfectly &s;in|cere, having the &s;ame human nature which we have, and feeling, a little before he was apprehended, the weight of that work upon him, for which he came into the world, was

<HI>&s;orrowful even unto death;</HI> here the human nature &s;truggled to be excu&s;ed from a cup &s;o bitter; but his prayers centered in re&s;ignation, <HI>Not my will but thine be done.</HI> In this conflict, &s;o great was his agony that <HI>&s;weat like drops of blood fell from him to the ground.</HI></P>
<P>BEHOLD now as foretold by the prophet, he is in a judicial manner <HI>numbered with the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors.</HI> Behold him as &s;ome poor man of no reputation, &s;tanding before the high prie&s;t and elders, and before Herod and Pi|late, where witne&s;&s;es appear again&s;t him, and he mindful of the mo&s;t gracious de&s;ign of his coming, declineth to plead in his own defence, <HI>but as a &s;heep that is dumb before his &s;hearer,</HI> &s;o under many accu&s;ations, revilings and buffetings remained &s;ilent. And tho' he &s;ignified to Peter that he had acce&s;s to power &s;ufficient to overthrow all their out|ward forces; yet retaining a re&s;ignation to &s;uffer for the &s;ins of mankind, he exerted not that power, but permitted them to go on in their malicious de&s;igns, and pronounce him to be worthy of death, even him who was perfect in goodne&s;s; thus <HI>in his humilia|tion his judgment was taken away,</HI> and he, like &s;ome vile criminal, <HI>led as a lamb to the &s;laugh|ter.</HI> Under the&s;e heavy tryals (though poor un&s;table Pilate was convinced of his inno|cence, yet) the people generally looked upon him as a deceiver, a bla&s;phemer, and the ap|proaching puni&s;hment as a ju&s;t judgment
<PB N="17" REF="011948_0009_0F87887F18C54730">
upon him, <HI>They e&s;teemed him &s;mitten of God and afflicted.</HI> So great had been the &s;urprize of his di&s;ciples, at his being taken by armed men, that they <HI>for&s;ook him and fled;</HI> thus they hid their faces from him, he was de|&s;pi&s;ed, and by their conduct it appeared as though <HI>they e&s;teemed him not.</HI></P>
<P>BUT contrary to that opinion, of his being &s;mitten of God and afflicted, it was for our &s;akes that <HI>he was put to grief; he was wound|ed for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; he was brui&s;ed for our iniquities;</HI> and under the weight of them ma|nife&s;ting the deepe&s;t compa&s;&s;ion for the in&s;tru|ments of his mi&s;ery, laboured as their ad|vocate, and in the deeps of affliction, with an unconquerable patience, cried out, <HI>Father forgive them, they know not what they do!</HI></P>
<P>NOW this mind being in us, which was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, it removes from our hearts the de&s;ire of &s;uperiority, worldly honour or greatne&s;s; a deep attention is felt to the di|vine coun&s;ellor, and an ardent engagement to promote, as far as we may be enabled, the happine&s;s of mankind univer&s;ally; this &s;tate, where every motion from a &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit yieldeth to pure love, I may, with grati|tude to the father of mercies acknowledge, is often opened before me as a pearl to dig after; attended with a living concern, that among&s;t the many nations and families on the earth, tho&s;e who believe in the Me&s;&s;iah, that <HI>he was manife&s;ted to de&s;troy the works of

<P>WHERE the trea&s;ures of pure love are opened, and we obediently fol|low him who is the light of life, the mind becomes cha&s;te; and a care is felt, that the unction from the holy one may be our leader in every undertaking.</P>
<P>IN being crucified to the world, broken off from that friend&s;hip which is enmity with God, and dead to the cu&s;toms and fa&s;hions which have not their foundation in the truth; the way is prepared to lowline&s;s in outward living, and to a di&s;entangle|ment from tho&s;e &s;nares which attends the

Thus they are taught, not only to keep to a moderate advance and uprightne&s;s in their dealings; but to con&s;ider the tendency of their pro|ceeding; to do nothing which they know would operate again&s;t the cau&s;e of univer|&s;al righteou&s;ne&s;s; and to keep continually in view the &s;preading of the peaceable king|dom of Chri&s;t among&s;t mankind.</P>
<P>THE prophet I&s;aiah &s;pake of the gathered church, in the &s;imilitude of a city, where many being employed were all pre&s;erved in purity; <HI>They &s;hall call them the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord, and thou &s;halt be called &s;ought out, a city not for&s;aken.</HI> lxiii. 10. And the apo&s;tle after mentioning the my&s;tery of Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings exhorts, <HI>Be ye holy in all manner of conver&s;ation.</HI> 1 Pet. i. 15. There is a conver&s;ation nece&s;&s;ary in trade; and there is a conver&s;ation &s;o foreign from the nature of Chri&s;t's kingdom, that it is repre|&s;ented in the &s;imilitude of one man pu&s;hing another with a warlike weapon, <HI>There is that &s;peaketh like the piercings of a &s;word.</HI> Prov. xii, 18. Now in all our concerns it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="20" REF="011948_0011_0F878881AF4F2138">
that the leading of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t be humbly waited for and faithfully follow|ed, as the only means of being pre&s;erved cha&s;te as an holy people, who <HI>in all things are circum&s;pect.</HI> Exod. xxiii. 13, that no|thing we do may carry the appearance of approbation of the works of wickedne&s;s, make the unrighteous more at ea&s;e in un|righteou&s;ne&s;s, or occa&s;ion the injuries com|mitted again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ed to be more lightly looked over.</P>
<P>WHERE morality is kept to, and &s;upport|ed by the inhabitants of a country, there is a certain reproach attends tho&s;e individuals among&s;t them, who manife&s;tly deviate there|from. Thus, if a per&s;on of good report, is charged with &s;tealing goods out of an open &s;hop in the day time, and on a public tryal found guilty, and the law in that ca&s;e put in execution, he therein &s;u&s;tains a lo&s;s of repu|tation; but if he be convicted a &s;econd and third time of the like offence, his good name would cea&s;e among&s;t &s;uch who knew the&s;e things. If his neighbour, reputed an ho|ne&s;t man, being charged with buying goods of this thief, at a time when the purcha&s;er knew they were &s;tolen, and on a publick tryal is found guilty, this purcha&s;er would meet with di&s;e&s;teem, but if he per&s;i&s;ted in buying &s;tolen goods, knowing them to be &s;uch, and was publickly convicted thereof a &s;econd and third time, he would no longer
<PB N="21" REF="011948_0011_0F878881AF4F2138">
be con&s;idered as an hone&s;t man by them who knew the&s;e things; nor would it appear of good report to be found in his company buying his traffick, till &s;ome evident tokens of &s;incere repentance appeared in him. But where iniquity is committed openly, and the authors of it are not brought to ju&s;tice, nor put to &s;hame, their hands grow &s;trong. Thus the general corruption of the Jews &s;hortly before their &s;tate was broke up by the Chaldeans, is de&s;cribed by their bold|ne&s;s in impiety; for as their leaders were connected together in wickedne&s;s, they &s;trengthened one another, and grew con|fident, <HI>Were they a&s;hamed when they had com|mitted abominations? nay, they were not at all a&s;hamed, neither could they blu&s;h.</HI> Jer. vi. 15, on which account the Lord thus expo&s;tu|lates with them, <HI>What hath my beloved to do in my hou&s;e, &s;eeing &s;he hath wrought lewdne&s;s with many, and the holy fle&s;h is pa&s;&s;ed from thee, when thou doe&s;t evil, then thou rejoice&s;t.</HI> Jer. xi. 15.</P>
<P>NOW the faithful friends of Chri&s;t, who hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s, and in|wardly breathe that his kingdom may come on earth as it is in heaven, he teacheth them to be quick of under&s;tanding in his fear, and to be very attentive to the means he may ap|point for promoting pure righteou&s;ne&s;s in the earth; and as &s;hame is due to tho&s;e who&s;e works manife&s;tly operate again&s;t the gracious de&s;ign of his &s;ufferings for us, a care lives on

their minds that no wrong cu&s;toms however &s;upported may bya&s;s their judgments, but that they may humbly abide under the cro&s;s and be pre&s;erved in a conduct which may not contribute to &s;trengthen the hands of the wicked in their wickedne&s;s, or to remove &s;hame from tho&s;e to whom it is ju&s;tly due. The coming of that day is precious in which we experience the truth of this expre&s;&s;ion. <HI>The Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Jer. xiii. 6, and feel him to be <HI>made unto us wi&s;dom and &s;anctificati|on.</HI></P>
<P>THE example of a righteous man is often looked at with attention. Where righteous men join in bu&s;ine&s;s their company gives en|couragement to others; and as one grain of incen&s;e deliberately offered to the prince of this world, renders an offering to God in that &s;tate unacceptable; and from tho&s;e e&s;teemed leaders of the people may be injurious to the weak; it requires deep humility of heart, to follow him faithfully, who alone gives &s;ound wi&s;dom and the &s;pirit of true di&s;cerning; and O how nece&s;&s;ary it is, to con&s;ider the weight of a holy profe&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>THE conduct of &s;ome formerly, gave occa|&s;ion of complaint again&s;t them, <HI>Thou ha&s;t de|filed thy &s;anctuaries by the multitude of thine ini|quities, by the iniquity of thy traffick.</HI> Ezek. xxviii. 18, and in &s;everal places it is charged again&s;t I&s;rael that they had polluted the holy name.</P>

<P>HE proceeds in the &s;pirit of prophecy to &s;hew how the faithful being &s;upported under temptations, would be pre&s;erved from that defilement that there is in the love of money; that as they who in a reverent waiting on God, feel their &s;trength renewed, are &s;aid to <HI>mount upward;</HI> &s;o here their pre&s;ervation from the &s;nare of unrighteous gain, is repre|&s;ented in the likene&s;s of a man, borne up above all crafty, artful means of getting the advantage of another, <HI>They &s;hall dwell on high;</HI> and points out the &s;tability and firmne&s;s of their condition, <HI>His place of defence &s;hall be the munition of rocks;</HI> and that under all the outward appearances of lo&s;s, in denying him&s;elf of gainful profits for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, yet through the care of him who pro|vides for the &s;parrows, he &s;hould have a &s;upply an&s;werable to his infinite wi&s;dom, <HI>Bread &s;hall
