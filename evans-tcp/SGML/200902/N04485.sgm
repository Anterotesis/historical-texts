<HEAD>A Twig of Birch for <HI>Billy</HI>'s Breech, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is well known that a Cau&s;e oftentimes &s;uffers more from the Un&s;kilfulne&s;s of its Advocates, than from the Strength and Num|ber of its Enemies. For this Rea&s;on, it has been a Method with &s;ome Per&s;ons to di&s;guize them&s;elves under fictitious Names, and appear outwardly in Defence of that which, in their Hearts, they are endeavouring to de&s;troy. And the&s;e, by a <HI>de&s;ignedly</HI> weak and injudi|cious Management of the Controver&s;y, have many times with ea&s;e, ef|fected that which it would have co&s;t them much Labour and Pains to do by an open and avow'd Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Upon reading a Pamphlet &s;ub&s;cribed <HI>William Hobby,</HI> entitled, <HI>A Defence of the Itinerancy, and the Conduct of the Rev. Mr. Whitefield,</HI> which was the la&s;t Week &s;hov'd into the World, I readily imagin'd it to be a Stratagem of this Kind; and &s;hould have thought it tolerably well executed, had I not di&s;covered too much <HI>Rancour</HI> and <HI>Malice</HI> in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages of it, and too much <HI>Profane&s;s</HI> in others.</P>
<P>In this my Mi&s;take I &s;hould probably have continued, had I not been informed, that there was <HI>really</HI> a Per&s;on of the Name &s;ub&s;cribed to the Pamphlet; that he was Pa&s;tor of a Pari&s;h in a &s;mall Town &s;ome few Miles from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and that he was far from any <HI>De&s;ign</HI> to hurt Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Intere&s;t by the Publication of his Piece, though it might <HI>in reality</HI> have that Effect. Upon this Information, I could not help pity|ing Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> who&s;e Cau&s;e I now look'd upon as at the la&s;t Ga&s;p, &s;ince it &s;tood in Need of &s;uch wretched Stuff to keep it alive. But at the &s;ame Time, <HI>Sir,</HI> I mu&s;t own, I felt &s;ome Indignation again&s;t the <HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;umption</HI> you have di&s;covered, by engaging in a Contro|ver&s;y for which you are &s;o little qualify'd, and with the very Grounds
<PB N="4" REF="005563_0003_101869A243C992F0">and Foundation of which, your Letter plainly &s;hows you are altogether unacquainted.</P>
<P>GOD, we are told, requires no more of us than we are able to perform. His Expectations from us are in Proportion to the Talents he has given us. So that, it &s;eems, <HI>your</HI> Stage of Duty is inclo&s;ed in a very &s;mall Circle, in which, if you had confined your&s;elf, and been content to have remained unknown beyond the Limits of your own Pari&s;h, you might, like many others, have &s;ilently pa&s;s'd through the World unnoticed and uncen&s;ured. But alas, the Vanity of &s;ome Men! who had rather be known to be bad, than not known at all. Since therefore you have broke through your Bounds, and thus openly proclaimed your Igno|rance and Wickedne&s;s to the World, it may not be improper, in this public Manner, to tell you of your Faults, and give you &s;ome gentle Reproof.</P>
<P>I know very well, the general Opinion of your Performance is, that it rather de&s;erves the <HI>Cha&s;ti&s;ement of the Cudgel,</HI> than the <HI>Confutation of the Pen.</HI> But when I con&s;ider that the End of Puni&s;hment, in this World, ought to be not &s;o much to afflict the <HI>Offender,</HI> as to deter others from the <HI>Offence,</HI> I can't but think this Way the mo&s;t likely to have a good Effect, that others may <HI>hear and fear and do no more any &s;uch Wickedne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>It would certainly have been not a little for your Credit, &s;ince it ap|pears that you are not your&s;elf much &s;kill'd in Language, to have em|ployed &s;ome Per&s;on who under&s;tood <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and was acquainted with the <HI>Rules of Grammar,</HI> to overlook and correct your <HI>Letter</HI> before you offered it to the Public; for I think no Man has a Right to trouble the World with any thing &s;o stuff'd with Blunders as this Performance of yours. You tell us in pa. 4. "The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> did not, <HI>nor would not</HI> preach."&mdash;But do you not know the Force of two Negatives, and that the Meaning of this Expre&s;&s;ion is directly contrary to what you de&s;ign? So in p. 11. &s;peaking of the <HI>Itinerancy</HI> you &s;ay, <HI>Mr. Whitefield is peculiarly form'd for &s;uch a De&s;ign.</HI> But how does the <HI>Itinerancy</HI> ap|pear to be a <HI>De&s;ign?</HI> There may, for ought I know, be a De&s;ign in it; but that the Thing it&s;elf is a <HI>De&s;ign,</HI> we &s;hould, perhaps, never have found out, if you had not told us. Again, pa. 24. you &s;peak of &s;ome|body <HI>having been all the Week o'running Goods,</HI> and afterwards tell us of <HI>three Hog&s;heads of Sugar</HI> that <HI>weigh heavy with Guilt.</HI> But what the poor Hog&s;heads had done, that &s;uch a heavy Load of Guilt &s;hould hang upon <HI>them,</HI> you have not been kind enough to tell us. I have heard of
<PB N="5" REF="005563_0004_101869A3FAF6E4F8">many Sorts of Sugar, but never heard of <HI>Guilty Sugar</HI> till now. But to repeat all the In&s;tances of fal&s;e Grammar and bad <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> would be to tran&s;cribe the whole Book; a Ta&s;k which I am &s;ure it would be un|rea&s;onable to impo&s;e upon any one who has already undergone the Penance of reading it. Should a <HI>School Boy</HI> commit &s;uch Blunders, we know well enough, what his Puni&s;hment would be. A little <HI>Birch</HI> duly apply'd would bring him to a Sen&s;e of his Faults, and make him more careful for the future. But you, <HI>Sir,</HI> are like to e&s;cape with Im|punity, &s;ince your <HI>Rev. Breech</HI> is exempt from this Kind of Correction, and it is highly probable you will be in&s;en&s;ible to any other. I will only add here, that if the Rev. Mr. <HI>M.&mdash;d</HI> de&s;igns ever again to fa|vour the World with any of his Labours, <HI>now is his Time,</HI> or <HI>never;</HI> for if he lets this Opportunity e&s;cape, he can never hereafter hope to meet with another Pamphlet to keep his own in Countenance. I &s;hall go on now, and take Notice of <HI>&s;ome</HI> of your Faults of another Kind.</P>
<P>You &s;et out with endeavouring, in the fir&s;t place, to de&s;end <HI>Itine|rancy.</HI> But it &s;eems you have been &s;o unlucky here, as <HI>intirely</HI> to mi&s;|take the Que&s;tion in Di&s;pute. For who has ever affirmed, that <HI>Itine|rant</HI> Preaching is <HI>in it &s;elf</HI> &s;o unlawful, as not to be allow'd <HI>upon any Account at all?</HI> or, that a Mini&s;ter ought <HI>never</HI> to preach out of his own Pulpit? Upon this Suppo&s;ition, however, you be&s;tir your &s;elf mo&s;t notably for about a dozen Pages, to prove what nobody ever yet thought of denying. The greate&s;t Oppo&s;ers of Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Itinerancy will readily allow, that there <HI>may be</HI> and often <HI>are</HI> Rea&s;ons and particular Cir|cum&s;tances that will make <HI>Itinerant</HI> Preaching not only lawful but ex|pedient; and &s;hould <HI>he</HI> direct his Zeal where the&s;e Circum&s;tances take Place, they would never either condemn or oppo&s;e his Conduct. Should he <HI>journey to Maryland, Virginia</HI> or <HI>Carolina,</HI> where Preachers are <HI>&s;carce,</HI> and the Inhabitants <HI>&s;catter'd,</HI> or take a Voyage to &s;ome Parts of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> where Religion is little known and le&s;s practi&s;ed, he might not only <HI>e&s;cape Cen&s;ures</HI> but <HI>de&s;erved Applau&s;e.</HI> By this he would con|vince the <HI>Gain-&s;ayers,</HI> that his De&s;ign was the &s;ame with his Profe&s;&s;ion, the Glory of his Ma&s;ter, and the Good of his Neighbour, without any worldly Con&s;iderations of his own. So that it is not Itinerancy <HI>barely as &s;uch,</HI> that is condemned, but Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s <HI>Itinerancy:</HI> And unle&s;s <HI>this</HI> can be defended, you do nothing; for you have as yet only beat the Air, and &s;weated hard to defeat a Phantom of your own rai&s;ing.</P>
<P>You go on <HI>to enquire whether the Itinerancy,</HI> by which I &s;uppo&s;e you mean Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s, <HI>may not probably &s;ub&s;erve &s;ome good and valuable
<PB N="6" REF="005563_0005_101869A5E92C4C68">Ends?</HI> And if &s;o, you a&s;k, <HI>why it &s;hould not be countenanced?</HI> I an&s;wer, becau&s;e it <HI>certainly</HI> di&s;&s;erves <HI>more</HI> and <HI>better</HI> and <HI>more valuable</HI> Ends. Of this there are as many Witne&s;&s;es as there are mournful Spectators of the Di&s;&s;entions and Di&s;orders that have torn &s;o many Towns, Churches, and even private Families in pieces. We have &s;een <HI>Malice</HI> and <HI>Hatred</HI> treading upon the Neck of <HI>Charity,</HI> and every Man's <HI>Heart</HI> and <HI>Tongue</HI> &s;et again&s;t his Brother. We have &s;een <HI>Religion's lovely Form</HI> metamor|pho&s;ed into the <HI>mo&s;t ugly Mon&s;ter, Religious A&s;&s;emblies</HI> turn'd into <HI>frantic Tumults,</HI> and the <HI>Beauty of Holine&s;s</HI> into the <HI>Confu&s;ion of Bedlam.</HI> And are the&s;e no Evils? Or are they Evils &s;o <HI>light</HI> as to be overbalanced by the throwing a few &s;illy Girls into <HI>Hy&s;terics?</HI></P>
<P>You &s;ometime after &s;ay, you <Q>really believe, that the Go&s;pel is as faithfully preached in <HI>New England,</HI> as in any part of the World, in the Generality of our Churches.</Q> What Value the Clergy may &s;et upon this Te&s;timony, I know not; but for my own Part, con&s;idering from whence it comes, I cannot look upon it as any great Complement, You add, <Q>tho' God knows it is preached but poorly enough in many of them.</Q> I am apt to think that the People of <HI>Reading</HI> know this too; otherwi&s;e they would not have di&s;covered &s;o great a Readine&s;s to part with their Pa&s;tor, as they did <HI>on a late Occa&s;ion.</HI> A little on ward you come to lament, that <Q>proper Watch&s;ulne&s;s over the Pulpits of <HI>New-England</HI> has been greatly decaying&mdash;In Con&s;equence of which Re|mi&s;ne&s;s many have admitted into the Mini&s;try, of inferior Knowledge,</Q><HI>&amp;c.</HI> This, I am of Opinion, is not Matter of &s;o great Lamentation to you, as to many others, &s;ince you have been &s;o great a Gainer by <HI>the Con&s;equence.</HI> For had this Watchfulne&s;s over the Pulpits of <HI>New England</HI> been kept up, and none <HI>admitted into the Mini&s;try of in|ferior Knowledge, loo&s;e Principles or of poor Lives,</HI> you might, beyond all doubt, have engaged in the pre&s;ent Expedition, provided you had e&s;caped the la&s;t, without the <HI>Formality of applying for the Con&s;ent of a Pari&s;h.</HI> You pur&s;ue this Subject, and add, <Q>or rather &s;hall I &s;ay, that &s;ome have been admitted into Chri&s;t's Pulpits, who perhaps were not fit to be received into his Church? In&s;tances of this Nature might ea&s;ily be produced in too great Plenty, and I need not go far for &s;ome of them neither.</Q> Here indeed you have &s;poken the Truth; for if we may judge of the Tree by its Fruit, every Page of your Let|ter is an ample Proof that you were furni&s;hed with ONE In&s;tance of this, without &s;tirring a Step for it.</P>
<P>But it &s;eems, the Expediency and Lawfulne&s;s of the <HI>Itinerancy</HI> further
<PB N="7" REF="005563_0006_101869A8935E2528">appears from this, <HI>that &s;ome of the greate&s;t Oppo&s;ers of it have them&s;elve been benefitted by it.</HI> And it it &s;uch a &s;trange Thing that good Men &s;hould be benefitted by the Faults and Mi&s;carriages which they ob&s;erve in the World? They may and will reap Advantage to them&s;elves from the Wickedne&s;s of others. This puts them upon lamenting the Depra|vity and Weakne&s;s of Human Nature, and excites in them a greater Vigilance over their own Conduct. It &s;hows them the Need they have of divine Re&s;traints, and rai&s;es up their Soul in Gratitude to that God <HI>who maketh them to differ.</HI> Every In&s;tance of Perjury or Murder that comes within their Notice, works the&s;e good Di&s;po&s;itions in them; but who, for this Rea&s;on, ever argued that Perjury and Murder were either <HI>expedient</HI> or <HI>lawful?</HI></P>
<P>You go on to tell us another good Effect of the <HI>Itinerancy,</HI> that <Q>Things that were <HI>weak</HI> in many Places have been <HI>&s;trengthened,</HI> and tho&s;e which were <HI>ready to die</HI> are in a Mea&s;ure <HI>revived.</HI></Q> This alas! is a melancholy Truth. The Fueds and Contentions that had &s;o long reigned among us were &s;ub&s;iding, and Brethren began to look kindly one upon another. That cen&s;orious, uncharitable Spirit which had raged with &s;o much Fury was &s;ickning apace, and would, in all Proba|bility, before now have given up the Gho&s;t, had not this &s;econd Itinera|tion <HI>revived</HI> and <HI>&s;trengthned</HI> it. For, whether you <HI>know</HI> it or not, every Man who views things with an unprejudiced Eye, and is able to trace <HI>Effects</HI> up to their <HI>Cau&s;es,</HI> will ea&s;ily di&s;cover <Q>that the&s;e things nece&s;&s;arily, in the Nature of Things, flow from the <HI>Itinerancy,</HI> and that this is properly <HI>cau&s;al</HI> of them.</Q> You however are bold enough to &s;ay, <Q>whatever be the Judgment of others, I &s;hall EVER give it as <HI>mine,</HI> that 'tis not the <HI>Itinerancy</HI> but the <HI>Oppo&s;ition</HI> to it, that has made the Confu&s;ions of the pre&s;ent Day.</Q> Well determin'd for a young&s;ter, truly! But how do you know that this will <HI>always</HI> be your Judgment? Wi&s;er and better Men have changed their Opinions, as to <HI>this very Matter;</HI> and may it not be po&s;&s;ible for you to do &s;o too? Is your impe|netrable Scull Proof again&s;t the Force of the &s;tronge&s;t Arguments? Or does the <HI>triple Bra&s;s round your Heart</HI> make it impo&s;&s;ible for Conviction to enter? But if &s;o, have you ever learned, with all your Divinity, that <HI>Ob&s;tinacy</HI> and <HI>a &s;eared Con&s;cience</HI> are <HI>chri&s;tian Graces?</HI> Why then do you make this public Boa&s;t? Why do you thus glory in your Shame?</P>
<P>A little onward you advi&s;e us to <HI>a Conduct with Regard to Itincrants,</HI> which is indeed highly rea&s;onable. "Thy, &s;ay you, the <HI>Spirits</HI> by the Word of God."&mdash;Agreed&mdash;This is the very Te&s;t to which the
<PB N="8" REF="005563_0007_101869AAF7E3DC80">Oppo&s;ers would bring them; and by the Deci&s;ions of this they are willing to &s;tand or fall. You add, "and the everla&s;ting Rea&s;on of Things." How the&s;e Words came into your Mouth, I cannot imagine. Why do you thus <HI>to&s;s upon your Tongue Terms</HI> of which you have no Under&s;tanding? For knowe&s;t thou not, O vain young Man, that if the <HI>everla&s;ting Rea&s;on of Things</HI> is once appeal'd to, thy Cau&s;e mu&s;t vani&s;h in a moment, like a thin Vapour before the Noon-day Sun?</P>
<P>I cannot forbear taking Notice, how manfully you beat down an Objection rai&s;ed again&s;t Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> that he has appropriated Money which he has collected, to other U&s;es than tho&s;e for which it was de|&s;igned. This you tell us cannot be, becau&s;e he has not bought either Hou&s;es or Lands; and run on with this Argument with wonderful Vo|lubility for about half a Page. But here you really &s;eem, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ink <HI>even beneath your&s;elf.</HI> For it is no more than &s;aying, Mr. <HI>White|field</HI> can't be &s;uppos'd to have embezzled any Money, becau&s;e he has not been weak enough <HI>him&s;elf</HI> to prove to all the World that he has done &s;o. For my own Part, I never thought there was &s;ufficient Ground for this Objection again&s;t Mr. <HI>Whitefield;</HI> but if this is all that can be &s;aid in his Defence, I may, perhaps, change my Opinion for the future, &s;ince to me it looks more like <HI>owning</HI> the Charge, than <HI>vindicating</HI> him from it.</P>
<P>Another Objection again&s;t Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> which you have thought fit to encounter, is the injurious Reflections he has thrown upon the <HI>Col|lege.</HI> And here having given your Opinion of the <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> which the Heads of that Society have publi&s;hed again&s;t him and his Conduct, you add, <Q>I cannot find that <HI>Circumci&s;ion availeth</HI> much, <HI>or Uncircumci&s;ion,</HI>  to the Proof of the Charges alledged again&s;t Mr. <HI>Whitefield;</HI></Q> by which you have di&s;covered no great Regard for that Go&s;pel you profe&s;s to preach; otherwi&s;e you would never have &s;acrificed it to &s;uch a <HI>pitiful low Pun,</HI> and proved to the World, that you are equally de&s;titute of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Wit.</HI> You go on, however, and <Q>declare, that Mr. <HI>White|field</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ion has been ever di&s;agreeable to you, as it tended to di&s;courage the Growth of the College;</Q> and yet pre&s;ently after give us to under&s;tand, that it might be <Q>a Piece of <HI>Service</HI> beneficial to the College.</Q> But how that which tends to di&s;courage the Growth of the College, can be &s;aid to be <HI>beneficial</HI> to it, I confe&s;s I am not able to comprehend. In like Manner you &s;ay, <Q>that unle&s;s real and &s;ub&s;tan|tial <HI>Godline&s;s</HI> was better under&s;tood and practiced within a few Years after I left the <HI>College,</HI> than when I was there, the <HI>College</HI> in general
<PB N="9" REF="005563_0008_101869ACF4DFC440">might ju&s;tly be &s;aid to be in <HI>Darkne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;We dwelt much upon the <HI>Shell</HI> of Religion, but little regarded <HI>the Pearl of great Price.</HI>&mdash;All this is to be under&s;tood of the Society in general.</Q>&mdash;And pre&s;ently after, "Religion was at a <HI>low Ebb</HI> among the Students <HI>in general.</HI>" And was this &s;ame College <HI>at this Time</HI> one of the Glories of the Land? You had ju&s;t before declared, that it <HI>ever was,</HI> and you hoped ever would be &s;o. "However, cry you, I am no Judge in this Matter," and then very mode&s;tly proceed to give Judgment, and pronounce Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> "greatly excu&s;able, if not intirely ju&s;ti&s;iable." Really, <HI>Sir,</HI> here is a Clu&s;ter of Incon&s;i&s;tencies, which it will require the utmo&s;t Skill of &s;ome new <HI>Apologi&s;t</HI> to reconcile.</P>
<P>In order to prove the Truth of the Charge Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> has brought again&s;t the College, you &s;ay, <Q><HI>for my own part,</HI> had I no more Reli|gion <HI>after</HI> I left the <HI>College</HI> than I had <HI>there,</HI> I might have <HI>&s;old my Right</HI> to Heaven <HI>for a Me&s;s of Pottage,</HI> and been a Gainer by the Bargain.</Q> I am very &s;orry we have &s;o much Rea&s;on to judge, from the Spirit and Temper of your Pamphlet, that you might make the &s;ame Bargain <HI>now,</HI> and be no Lo&s;er by it. But, becau&s;e you was a <HI>gracele&s;s wicked Wretch</HI> when you was at College, does it therefore fol|low, that the generality of the Students mu&s;t be &s;o too? If this be ju&s;t Rea&s;oning, you have it <HI>equally</HI> in your Power to prove, that the College was likewife overwhelm'd with <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Stupidity.</HI></P>
<P>Another Argument you bring to prove the <HI>dark State</HI> of the College, is, that "one <HI>Tutor</HI> and one <HI>Profe&s;&s;or</HI> were di&s;carded for <HI>Immoralities.</HI>" Here you have unluckily blabb'd out a Truth again&s;t your&s;elf, which in a great Mea&s;ure overthrows all you have &s;aid upon this Subject. Had the College encouraged the&s;e Per&s;ons in their <HI>Immoralities,</HI> and continu|ed to hug them in her Bo&s;om, this indeed would have been a &s;ad Symptom of her Degeneracy. But the ca&s;ting them out from her up|on this Account, &s;urely is a &s;trong Proof, that Di&s;cipline was not at &s;uch a very <HI>low Ebb,</HI> nor the College immer&s;ed in &s;uch <HI>thick Darkne&s;s</HI> as you would have us believe. To the&s;e two In&s;tances, which you have brought, in Favour of the College, however you de&s;igned them to the contrary, I will add a Third. That when a <HI>young Man</HI> made Application for the Place of a Tutor, which was then vacant, and was &s;upported by the Recommendation of no lefs a Per&s;on than a Governour, the College re|jected him with Di&s;dain, well knowing that his <HI>inferior Knowledge, loo&s;e Principles, and to &s;ay no wor&s;e, poor Life,</HI> render'd him altogether unfit for &s;uch a Station. This In&s;tance &s;urely you have not forgot. I rather
<PB N="10" REF="005563_0009_101869AF1A0CCED8">think it was <HI>fre&s;h</HI> in your Mind while you was writing, and that it was the Remembrance of it that pu&s;h'd you on to your irreverent and &s;curri|lous Behaviour towards the College. You go on and &s;ay, <Q>another <HI>Tutor</HI> declares him&s;elf a Stranger <HI>at that Time</HI> to any true vital Piety.</Q> Here, tho' you do not mention his Name, it is well known who you mean. And much Good may <HI>his</HI> Te&s;timony do you. He once <HI>for|merly,</HI> and now again has run into &s;uch wild Freaks and Extravagan|cies, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> him&s;elf dare not countenance him.</P>
<P>But endeavour, if you can, <HI>impartially</HI> to recollect the State of the College while you was there; and then, if <HI>Shame</HI> and <HI>Sorrow</HI> will &s;uit a Con&s;titution like your's, be covered with <HI>Confu&s;ion</HI> for, what you have wrote. The Gentleman at the Head of the Society, when you entered, was a <HI>&s;tanch Calvini&s;t</HI> in Principle, of &s;trict Morals, and exerci&s;ed the <HI>&s;evere&s;t</HI> Di&s;cipline. His <HI>Succe&s;&s;or</HI> was renowned thro' the whole Land for his Piety; his Name is, upon that Account, mention'd among us with the utmo&s;t Honour, and his Memory will live for ever. The <HI>Tu|tors</HI> and <HI>Profe&s;&s;ors</HI> were, while you belonged to the Society, of virtuous Lives and Conver&s;ations, and of unblemi&s;h'd Characters; and all of them, except the two <HI>di&s;carded</HI> by the College, do at this Day make a di&s;tingui&s;h'd Figure in <HI>Church</HI> or <HI>State.</HI> Morning and Evening Pray|ers wee <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> kept up; the holy Scriptures read, and a &s;trict At|tendance required. None were allow'd to ab&s;ent them&s;elves from the public Wor&s;hip on Lord's Days, without &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Hindrance. Vice and Immorality of all Kinds were forbidden upon the <HI>&s;evere&s;t</HI> Pe|nalties, and when detected, were <HI>&s;ure</HI> to be puni&s;hed. And now, what Sign of <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> in all this? Why, &s;ay you, <Q>we dwelt much upon the <HI>Shell</HI> of Religion, but little regarded <HI>the Pearl of great Price.</HI></Q> That is, in other Words, the Students did not, as the Fa&s;hion is among &s;ome &s;ort of People at this Day, tell one another how often they &s;aid their Prayers, and how good they felt them&s;elves. What Pity is it, that a Practice, &s;o &s;uited to gratify a vain Temper, was not then in Vogue? If it had been, I doubt not we &s;hould have had a much <HI>earlier</HI> Date to <HI>your</HI> Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>I &s;ay nothing of the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> State of the College, becau&s;e you have con|fined your Reflections to your own Time, and the Gentlemen now con|cerned in the Government there, have their Characters too well e&s;tabli&s;h|ed to fear any Injury from &s;uch Pens as yours.</P>
<P>If an Attempt upon the Life of a Parent, could once untie the Tongue of a dumb Son, it may perhaps &s;eem &s;trange to &s;ome, that the <HI>Sons</HI> of
<PB N="11" REF="005563_0010_101869B1FB5E68F8">the College &s;hould all &s;it &s;o long &s;ilent, when they &s;ee &s;uch vile A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins &s;tabbing at the Reputation of their <HI>venerable Mother.</HI> But when we con&s;ider the Ob&s;curity of the&s;e Per&s;ons, for Mr. <HI>Whilefield,</HI> it la allow'd, had his Information from &s;ome <HI>&s;ecret</HI> Whi&s;perers, I &s;ay, if we con&s;ider their <HI>Ob&s;curity,</HI> and the <HI>Feeblene&s;s</HI> of their Attack, it will really be doing them too much Honour to take the Alarm. Would a Man draw a Sword again&s;t a Lou&s;e, or think it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;charge a Cannon to kill a Fly? Whenever any &s;hall appear again&s;t her, who&s;e Character may &s;eem to give Credit to their Cau&s;e, it will &s;oon be found, that among her Sons there are wanting neither <HI>Tongues</HI> nor <HI>Pens</HI> &s;ufficient for her Defence. She will and <HI>mu&s;t</HI> flouri&s;h as long as Religion, Vertue and Learning have Charms to attract our E&s;teem. Supporting the&s;e, and &s;upported by them, &s;he may &s;it &s;afe and unconcerned amid&s;t all the <HI>leaden</HI> then, ye <HI>&s;pightful Curs,</HI> do ye <HI>look up</HI> and <HI>bark</HI> and <HI>howl,</HI> the Object of your Malice is placed <HI>high</HI> above your Reach, nor <HI>&s;hines</HI> the le&s;s bright for all your <HI>Yellings.</HI></P>
<P>From this Head you pa&s;s to con&s;ider another Article again&s;t Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> which is, his having repre&s;ented the <HI>Generality</HI> of the Mi|ni&s;ters of this Land as <HI>unconverted Men.</HI> Upon this you &s;ay, <Q>Has Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> and where pronounced this the <HI>real State</HI> of the Mi|ni&s;try? No, but has only &s;aid, that he <HI>fears</HI> it, as (if I mi&s;take not) the Expre&s;&s;ion is.</Q> But you <HI>do</HI> mi&s;take, young Man; for the Expre&s;|&s;ion is not, that he <HI>fears</HI> it, but that he is VERILY PERSUADED of it; which, however you under&s;tand it, I take to be a pretty round A&s;&s;er|tion. So that all you have &s;aid here, to excu&s;e him as tho' he had only <HI>ju&s;t hinted</HI> his Fears, being built upon a fal&s;e Suppo&s;ition, mu&s;t of it &s;elf fall to the Ground. You go, on, <Q>But if Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> has <HI>in&s;inuated</HI> any thing as if many Mini&s;ters were <HI>unconverted,</HI> what need they by the Umbrage taken at the In&s;inuation, pave the Way to the Proof of it?</Q> A mo&s;t extravagant Piece of Arrogance this! Here we have a new Standard &s;et up, whereby we may judge of our own State, and that of others. But &s;hall the taking Umbrage at the mo&s;t exceptionable Step in Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Conduct, a Step which very few of his <HI>warme&s;t</HI> Advocates would pretend to ju&s;tify, and which <HI>he him&s;elf</HI> has condem|ned as ra&s;h and unwarrantable, I &s;ay, &s;hall the <HI>bare taking Umbrage</HI> at &s;uch a Step be &s;ufficient to <HI>prove</HI> a Man's Unconver&s;ion? Alas, poor deluded young Man! if the <HI>not taking Umbrage</HI> at this Behaviour of Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> be all the Evidence you have of your own Conver&s;ion,
<PB N="12" REF="005563_0011_101869B706C283B8">and I greatly fear you have no other, you are in a very mi&s;erable Con|dition indeed.</P>
<P>You come now to tell us in your 24th. pa. about <HI>o' running Goods,</HI> and <HI>three Hog&s;heads of Sugar weighing heavy with Guilt.</HI> This, as I have already ob&s;erved, being rank <HI>Non&s;en&s;e,</HI> may be neither <HI>true</HI> nor <HI>fal&s;e.</HI> But the ba&s;e In&s;inuation that you would couch under it, and the Temper and Spirit vi&s;ible in it, evidently di&s;cover that it proceeded from a Heart &s;woln with Malice. What is now become of your <HI>Pa&s;&s;age of Scripture</HI> that could <HI>give &s;uch a fatal Blow, or rather bla&s;t like a Fla&s;h of Lightning?</HI> Has it &s;o &s;uddenly lo&s;t all its Force? Or, have you not &s;ince you wrote your Pamphlet, ever once look'd into your Bible?</P>
<P>You go on and inform us, that you <Q>have &s;aid nothing about the <HI>Incon&s;i&s;tency</HI> of Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Conduct with his Obligations as a Mini&s;ter of the <HI>Church of England.</HI></Q> And, it &s;eems, the Rea&s;on of it is, becau&s;e <Q>this Objection is cru&s;h'd to Death by the late Apology for Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> again&s;t the Exceptions of <HI>L. K.</HI></Q> But alas! un|luckily for you, this Apology has been long &s;ince confuted, and &s;o <HI>uni|ver&s;ally</HI> exploded, that he <HI>fecret Contrivers</HI> of it, to &s;ave their &s;inking Reputation, have been obliged to di&s;own it. But it &s;eems you have been &s;o bu&s;y in writing your Letter, and &s;o wrapt up in the Contem|plation of the Applau&s;e it would heap upon you, that you knew no|thing of this. The <HI>Maul,</HI> heavy as it is, has not been able, in the lea&s;t, to blunt the Edge of the <HI>Razor;</HI> no, this remains keen and bright as ever, and is like to do &s;o, while <HI>the other,</HI> with us owr Weight, is &s;ink|ing a-pace into the Earth.</P>
<P>You are willing, however, after all, <Q>to allow Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> has his Foibles and Imperfections, and that he is <HI>a Man of like Pa&s;&s;ions with others.</HI></Q> Wonderful Conde&s;cention indeed! You go on and &s;ay, <Q>I would do by him as God him&s;elf doth by &s;inful Man, damn the Sin and glorify the Sinner.</Q> Alas, to what a Height of Impiety are you arrived! The Parallel has often been run beteen our Saviour and Mr. <HI>Whitefield:</HI> You your&s;elf have done it &s;everal Times in your Letter; and it is now become &s;o familiar to us, that our Ears &s;eem to be no longer &s;hock'd at it. But here you ri&s;e a Step higher. And do you know, poor young Man, the Meaning of the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions you &s;o wan|tonly throw out? Surely if you did, you would never talk thus of <HI>your damning</HI> the Sin, and <HI>GLORIYYING</HI> the Sinner. In &s;hort, nothing but the mo&s;t profound Ignorance can acquit you from the Guilt of the highe&s;t Prophanene&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005563_0012_101869B8EE04AB90">
There is one Thing more I will ju&s;t take Notice of, as a Proof of your exqui&s;ite Faculty of Di&s;cernment. Speaking of Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s De&s;ign of bringing over a Number of Mini&s;ters from <HI>Scotland</HI> and other Places to &s;ettle among us, and having told us there can be no Harm in this, you go on to a&s;k, "Are there not two Pulpits at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> &s;upply'd and adorned with the Produce of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland?</HI>" Had the&s;e two Pulpits been thus coupled together by any Body el&s;e, we &s;hould immediately have known it was done with a De&s;ign that they &s;hould &s;et off each other by way of <HI>Contra&s;t:</HI> But as it comes from <HI>you,</HI> it mu&s;t be looked upon as a &s;trange confounding of Characters, a motly Mix|ture of <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Darkne&s;s;</HI> and you might as well have jumbled toge|ther, as Ornaments of the Mathematics, Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> and <HI>Whittemore the Almanack maker.</HI> And is the Rev. Mr. <HI>M.&mdash;d</HI> &s;uch an Ornament to the Pulpit? This, among many others, is one In&s;tance of the Solidity of your Judgement, which may hereafter be remember'd to your Honour. It is no unu&s;ual Thing for Per&s;ons, from their general Character, or &s;ome particular Circum&s;tance of their Lives, to have prefix'd to their Names &s;ome honourable Epither, without which they are &s;eldom or never men|tion'd. Thus we &s;ay, the <HI>wi&s;e Solomon,</HI> the <HI>venerable Bede,</HI> the <HI>incom|perable Newton;</HI> and who knows but that future Ages may add you to the illu&s;trious Roll by the Name of the JUDICIOUS HOBBY?</P>
<P>But it would be <HI>endle&s;s</HI> as well as <HI>needle&s;s</HI> to enumerate all the Faults of your Letter. I have &s;pent too much Time with you already, and &s;hall therefore only add, that if you are wi&s;e enough, from this gentle Rebuke, to &s;hrink back again into that Ob&s;curity, for which <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI> &s;eem to have de&s;igned you, it is probable you may e&s;|cape any further Correction for your pa&s;t Folly; as the <HI>Snail</HI> (for I would not be too unequal in my Compari&s;on) from the lighte&s;t Touch, retires into its Shell, and lies there &s;afe and un&s;een. But if you are ever hereafter caught out of your Line, or &s;hall again pre&s;ume to trouble the World with your <HI>Malice, Profanene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Non&s;ence,</HI> know, <HI>young Man,</HI> that there are tho&s;e, who want neither <HI>Inclination</HI> nor <HI>Power</HI> to cha&s;ti&s;e you with the utmo&s;t Severity your Offences &s;hall de&s;erve.</P>
