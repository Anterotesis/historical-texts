</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THESE are the words of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul;</HI> the occa&s;ion of them was this: The Prophet <HI>Agabus</HI> had foretold that the Jews would bind him at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and deliver him to the Gentiles, which mov'd his friends to be&s;eech him with tears not to go up. And we &s;ee here that this generous Per&s;on, who cou'd &s;ay of his own &s;ufferings, <HI>None of the&s;e things move me,</HI> was &s;carce able to bear the Sym|pathy of his friends; however, he rebukes them for urging him to &s;pare him&s;elf: <HI>What mean ye to weep, and break my heart:</HI> &mdash; And with great firmne&s;s of Mind declares his Re&s;olution to com|ply with GOD's Will, whatever befell him.

Let us then Attend to this DOCTRINE.</P>
<P><HI>It is our Duty to Prepare, and to be always in a Readine&s;s to Die.</HI></P>
<P>Now there are &s;uch Duties as the&s;e following, to be di&s;charged by us, if we would be Ready to Die.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We mu&s;t u&s;e the Means GOD affords us to make Ready for Death.</HI></P>
<P>GOD in His Word, threatned, <HI>In the day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die,</HI> Gen. 2.17. and a&s;&s;ureth us that it is <HI>appointed unto man once to die, and after that the Judgment,</HI> Heb. 9.27. Yea, that Man who is born of a Woman, is <HI>of few days,</HI> Job 14.1. We mu&s;t then <HI>look into the Scriptures,</HI> and learn from them the procuring cau&s;e, the certainty, and con&s;equence of Death. This plain truth mu&s;t be receiv'd upon the Te&s;ti|mony of GOD's Word, even when we do not feel the approaches of Death. And then, We mu&s;t heedfully and religiou&s;ly <HI>ob&s;erve the Provi|dences of GOD,</HI> which are a lively Comment up|on His Word, and cry in our Ears, <HI>All Fle&s;h is Gra&s;s</HI>&mdash;. Our Daily Experience mu&s;t be im|prov'd to Excite us to be al&s;o ready. When we &s;ee others taken away, and &s;ome very Suddenly, we &s;hould regard the operation of GOD's Hand, and receive In&s;truction. Again, We &s;hould be much in &s;erious and <HI>clo&s;e Meditation</HI> on this important Subject. We &s;hould con&s;ider the &s;hortne&s;s of Life, the certainty of Death, the great uncertainty of the time when we mu&s;t die,
<PB N="4" REF="002956_0006_0FE6A58B86330170">and the great Change Death will make upon us, when we mu&s;t bid an eternal farewell to the bu&s;ine&s;s and enjoyments of this Life, yea to the means of Grace we now enjoy; and lanch forth into an amazing Eternity, to be fixt forever in perfect Happine&s;s, or extreme Mi&s;ery. And here, We mu&s;t take pains to bring our Minds to a clo&s;e Application to the&s;e truths, which are irk&s;ome to fle&s;h and blood, and endeavour to mu&s;e till the fire burn, and our Hearts are &s;uitably affected. Furthermore, under a deep &s;en&s;e of our inability, as of our &s;elves, to improve the Means; we &s;hou'd <HI>Ask of GOD His Holy Spirit</HI> to ble&s;s them to us, and <HI>Pray,</HI> as P&s;al. 39.4. <HI>Lord, make me to know mine End.</HI> And 90. 12. <HI>So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our bearts unto wi&s;dom.</HI> For unle&s;s we obtain this Divine Teaching, tho' the Deaths of others, e&s;pecially when very &s;ud|den, may &s;tartle us, yet the impre&s;&s;ion will wear off without any &s;aving effect. GOD may call once, yea twice, but we &s;hall not hear &amp; an&s;wer his ju&s;t expectation. Prov. 1.24. <HI>I have called, and ye refu&s;ed, I have &s;tretched out my hand, and no man regarded.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>WE mu&s;t &s;eek after a &s;aving Conver&s;ion to GOD, and not be at re&s;t till we have clo&s;ed with the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as offered to us in the Go&s;pel.</HI> We mu&s;t be brought out of a &s;tate of Nature, into a &s;tate of Grace, by the Al|mighty Power of GOD, or we are not &s;o much as habitually prepared for Death. We were all by Nature, and as Children of the fir&s;t Adam,
<PB N="5" REF="002956_0007_0FE6A5459A455398"><HI>Dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es in &s;ins, and Children of Wrath.</HI> The <HI>Wages of Sin is Death,</HI> not only tempo|ral but eternal Death. If we are therefore found under the guilt and dominion of Sin, when <HI>Death</HI> overtakes us, <HI>Hell</HI> follows. Certainly then, it mo&s;t nearly concerns us to labour after a &s;aving Conver&s;ion to GOD, and vital Union with our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in order to our being in a readi|ne&s;s for Death. We mu&s;t be born again, born from above, of the Spirit of GOD, or we cant en|ter into the Kingdom of Heaven, and therefore are not fit to die. There mu&s;t be a &s;aving change wrought on all the powers of our Souls; we mu&s;t be turned from all Sin, unto GOD, or this great change will find us unprepar'd. We mu&s;t by the Grace of GOD obey that word, Act. 3.19. <HI>Re|pent and be Converted</HI> &mdash;. Unle&s;s we heartily grieve and mourn for our Sins as they are again&s;t GOD, turn from them with Godly Sorrow and Hatred, and return to GOD as our highe&s;t end and chief good; the valley of Death will lead to that place where is weeping and wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth for ever. We mu&s;t al&s;o obey that Word of Chri&s;t, Joh. 14.1. &mdash; <HI>Ye believe in God, believe al&s;o in me:</HI> For unle&s;s we receive the Record GOD hath given of His Son in the Go&s;pel, and "Re&s;t upon Him alone for Salvation" with that Faith which al&s;o purifieth the heart, and works by love; the &s;econd Death will come after the fir&s;t: we &s;hall die in our Sins, and peri&s;h for ever. Joh. 3.36. <HI>He that believeth on the Son, hath everla&s;ting life: and he that believeth not the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee life: but the wrath of
<PB N="6" REF="002956_0008_0FE6A58B9E9DC8A8">God abideth on on him.</HI> And 11.25. <HI>Je&s;us &s;aid unto her, I am the Re&s;urrection and the Life: be that believe thin me, though be were dead, yet &s;hall be live.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We mu&s;t labour diligently in fini&s;hing the Work GOD hath given us to do in this pre&s;ent Life.</HI> We have a Race to run, a Service to per|form, before we accompli&s;h as an hireling our day. There is the bu&s;ine&s;s of our General Cal|ling, which mu&s;t be engaged in and pro&s;ecuted with per&s;evering diligence: We mu&s;t work out our own Salvation with fear and trembling. <HI>For it is God which worketh in us, both to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure,</HI> Phil. 2.12, 13. And there is the bu&s;ine&s;s of our Particular Calling, which mu&s;t be attended in &s;ubordination to the other. And if we wou'd be ready, we mu&s;t be <HI>not &s;loth|ful in bu&s;ine&s;s, fervent in &s;pirit, &s;erving the Lord,</HI> Rom. 12.11. The &s;lothful and unprofitable Ser|vant, that hides his Lords Talents, may well be afraid of His coming to reckon with him. We mu&s;t therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> good and faithful Servants, im|prove our Talents, and all our Advantages to the honour of GOD. Now the&s;e are various; there are the Powers of Soul and Body, Gifts &amp; Graces, E&s;tate, Friends, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And all mu&s;t be diligently employ'd, that our Lord when He cometh may find us about His work, and &s;o in a meetne&s;s, thro Grace, to enter into our Ma&s;ter's joy. Our Lord Him&s;elf &s;aid, <HI>I mu&s;t work the works of him that &s;ent me, while it is day: the night cometh when no man can work,</HI> Joh. 9.4. And when about
<PB N="7" REF="002956_0009_0FE6A545B46F2FF0">to leave the World, he could appeal to his Father, and &s;ay, <HI>I have glorified thee on earth: I have fi|ni&s;hed the work thou gave&s;t me to do,</HI> Joh. 17.4. And we mu&s;t be followers of Him in our dili|gent Care to glorifie GOD, by doing His Will on Earth, if we would be Ready for our departure. Indeed after all, we mu&s;t confe&s;s we are unpro|fitable Servants, yea that we have fallen &s;hort of our duty, and accordingly depend on the perfect and meritorious obedience of Chri&s;t for Pardon and acceptance with GOD. However, we mu&s;t by a patient continuance in well-doing &s;eek for Glory &mdash;. When we are wearied with con&s;tant labour in our Lord's Service, tho' not weary of it, we &s;hall think with plea&s;ure of the Re&s;t which remains to the people of GOD in Heaven, and not need to be &s;urpris'd when GOD calls us to give up our Account. Let us then obey that word, Eccl. 9.10. <HI>What&s;oever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wi&s;dom in the grave whither thou goest.</HI> O Chri&s;tian! do you not yet &s;tand compleat, as to your profei&s;ed &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t. <HI>Have you not &s;hewn forth the Lords Death at his Table,</HI> and openly Seal'd the Co|venant in obedience to that Command, <HI>Do this in Remembrance of Me.</HI> Or make ha&s;te to keep this Commandment, le&s;t the reflection on &s;o great an Omi&s;&s;ion make your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> bed very unea&s;y to you. Have you &s;ignal advantages of &s;erving GOD and your Generation; improve them with|out delay. Are there any any <HI>Relative Duties</HI> you live in the neglect of, O repent and di&s;charge
<PB N="8" REF="002956_0010_0FE6A58DA1554B70">them in&s;tantly. Have you greatly <HI>wronged</HI> your <HI>Neighbour</HI> by your ill carriage, by unfaithfulne&s;s and di&s;hone&s;ty; O &s;eek to give him proper Sa|tisfaction, make Re&s;titution. Are there <HI>unhappy Differences</HI> where relative bonds oblige to e&s;pecial Love and Endearment: &s;eek to get them re|moved, that you may die in love and peace Are there any <HI>In&s;tructions</HI> or <HI>Warnings</HI> needful for your Children &amp; Servants, O delay them not. In a word, do your be&s;t that your Work may be done, and well done, that when Death comes you may have nothing to doe but to Die.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Live in the diligent Mortification of Sin, and groan daily for perfect deliverance from it.</HI> Sin is the Sting of Death, and the remains of it in GOD's own Children, are the cau&s;e of their inordinate fear of Death; this cau&s;eth the <HI>Na|tural Reluctance</HI> there is in us to a di&s;&s;olution to degenerate into a <HI>Criminal backwardne&s;s</HI> and un|willingne&s;s to an&s;wer GOD, when He calls us out of this World. Here then, we mu&s;t &s;eek the de&s;truction of our Lu&s;ts, die to Sin, and &s;o pre|pare for Death. We mu&s;t wage an holy war with Sin, with our mo&s;t beloved Lu&s;ts, cutting off the right hand, and plucking out the right eye. Col. 3.5. <HI>Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanne&s;s, inordinate affection, evil concupicence, and co|vetou&s;ne&s;s, which is idolatry.</HI> For this end we mu&s;t improve the Death of Chri&s;t. By Faith we mu&s;t realize it that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of &s;in might be de&s;troyed, and lay<PB N="9" REF="002956_0011_0FE6A54E80416248">a&s;ide the &s;in which mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;ets us, by look|ing unto Je&s;us. For this end we &s;hould walk in the Spirit, cheri&s;h its motions and follow his directions, who is the chief efficient in this work. Rom. 8.13. <HI>For if ye live after the fle&s;h ye &s;hall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body ye &s;hall live.</HI> In a word, the remains of &s;in in us &s;hould be our heavy burden under which we &s;hould groan for deliverence. Our Cry &s;hould be that, Rom. 7.24. <HI>O wretched man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death?</HI> Such a frame as this maintained in the Soul, would be an excellent means of re|conciling us to Death; for at Death, and not till then, &s;hall GOD's People be deliver'd from this wor&s;t of evils. Then their Warfare is accom|pli&s;h'd, and they are pre&s;ented faultle&s;s before GOD.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>We must endeavour more and more to &s;it loo&s;e from this World, and to get our Hearts wean|ed from Earthly Enjoyments.</HI> If we would be ready to Die, and leave this World, we mu&s;t <HI>not be conform'd to it, Rom.</HI> 12.2. There are the Men, and Things of this World; there are its corrupt Cu&s;toms, Fa&s;hions and Practices, from which we mu&s;t &s;eparate. Our Saviour <HI>gave him&s;elf for our &s;ins, that he might deliver us from this pre&s;ent evil World,</HI> Gal. 1.4. And we mu&s;t improve the bitter Death and Sufferings of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to crucifie our inordinate Af|fections to it. <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.14. <HI>By whom,</HI> i. e, a Cruci|fied Saviour; or <HI>whereby,</HI> i. e. the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t,
<PB N="10" REF="002956_0012_0FE6A58DB9CAC4F0"><HI>the World is crucified unto me, and I unto the World.</HI> This World contains tho&s;e objects which Satan makes u&s;e of to draw forth the lu&s;ts of Men. <HI>The lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, and the lu&s;t of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the World,</HI> 1 Joh. 2.16. Now if we <HI>love the World,</HI> and the things of the World as our Portion, the <HI>love of the Father</HI> is not in us; and we are not prepared to leave it: We mu&s;t then take care we do not walk according to the Cour&s;e of this World, but Renounce it. We mu&s;t rejoyce even in the lawful Enjoyments of this Life, as if we rejoyced not, and u&s;e this World as not abu&s;ing it, for the fa&s;hion of this World pa&s;&s;eth away. We mu&s;t not look upon this as our Re&s;ting Place, but confe&s;s <HI>we are &s;trangers and pilgrims on the Earth,</HI> Heb. 11.13. We mu&s;t behave our &s;elves as tho&s;e that are called out of this World, and do not depend on the&s;e things for our happine&s;s. We &s;hould look upon this Life to be as a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age to an endle&s;s Eternity, and &s;it loo&s;e from the&s;e things, that we may be ready to remove at &s;hort warning. And tho' it be true, we have here valuable Enjoyments, which we ought to acknowledge, to the honour of GOD who gives us the&s;e things richly to enjoy; yet we mu&s;t realize it, that they are all <HI>uncertain,</HI> and not the good Part which can't be taken away; and accordingly we &s;hould maintain &s;ome kind of holy indifferency towards them, and in the tem|per of our Minds a readine&s;s to leave them. To be &s;ure then we &s;hould not with Covetuous de&s;ires pur&s;ue the Riches, or other Enjoyments
<PB N="11" REF="002956_0013_0FE6A54E9AB766B8">of this World, and weary our &s;elves for the&s;e Va|nities; but rather moderate our de&s;ires towards the&s;e things, and be contented with GOD's allot|ment; <HI>for we brought nothing into this World, and it is certain we can carry nothing out,</HI> 1 Tim. 6.7, 8. Moreover, we &s;hould manage our Worldly bu&s;ine&s;s with a great deal of Re&s;ig|nation to the Will of GOD, and learn to &s;ay, <HI>If the Lord will, we &s;hall live, and do this, or that,</HI> James 4.15. When Mens heads are full of wordly projections, and their hearts are deeply rooted in the Earth, they mu&s;t be as it were torn away from it by violence; but when their hearts are already weaned and taken off from worldly things, they will be in a good mea&s;ure prepared to leave them, and go to GOD. But <HI>O how much do we need the e&s;pecial Influences of GOD's Grace that it may be &s;o!</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>We must live in the Exerci&s;e of Faith on in|vi&s;ible Realities, and &s;et our Affections more on things above.</HI> There's a variety of Graces to be Exerci&s;ed while attending this Duty; as a lively <HI>Hope</HI> of the Glory to be revealed to GOD's People: an holy <HI>Fear</HI> of the Judgments of GOD, which &s;hould Excite us to give diligence that we may be found of our Judge in Peace. But I &s;hall e&s;pecially in&s;tance in <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> the vigorous Exerci&s;e of which upon proper objects is an excellent preparative for Death. Man is an empty Creature, and hath an inextingu&s;hable Thir&s;t after happine&s;s: and therefore while he is &s;itting loo&s;e from this World, he mu&s;t look at heavenly things, and live by the Faith of the
<PB N="12" REF="002956_0014_0FE6A594A2BE64D8">Son of GOD. The World we pa&s;s into at Death is the <HI>Invi&s;ible World.</HI> We have no knowledge of it, but by Revelation from GOD, and there mu&s;t be Faith to receive the Te&s;timony of GOD &s;o as to lean the weight of our Souls upon his un|changible Truth, Faithfulne&s;s &amp; Goodne&s;s. We mu&s;t have an intire dependance on that GOD who is the Father, the Son and the Holy Gho&s;t. There mu&s;t be Faith in exerci&s;e that we may commend our departing Spirits into the hands of GOD the Father, as our reconciled Father in Chri&s;t; Faith, to Commit our Souls into the hands of GOD the Son as our Redeemer.
<NOTE PLACE="foot">&dagger; <HI>See Dr.</HI> Owen, <HI>of dying daily, p.</HI> 182.</NOTE> And to tru&s;t in the Spirit of GOD to put the fini&s;hing hand to his work of Grace in us, that <Q>being made perfect in holine&s;s we may pa&s;s into that Glory</Q> where nothing enters that defileth. There mu&s;t be Faith to realize it, that our depart|ed Spirits &s;hould be received to the Paradi&s;e of GOD, that when we are <HI>ab&s;ent from the body,</HI> we &s;hall be <HI>pre&s;ent with the Lord,</HI> and that being joyn'd with the Spirits of ju&s;t men made perfect.
