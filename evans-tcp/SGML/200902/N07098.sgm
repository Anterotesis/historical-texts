<HEAD>RELATION OF A VOYAGE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE TRANSIT of the Planet VENUS over the di&s;c of the SUN, being a mo&s;t important as well as curious phaenomenon, has for a long time im|ployed the con&s;ideration of A&s;tronomers. The fir&s;t notice that I find taken of it was by the &s;agacious <HI>Kepler,</HI> who flouri&s;hed not long after the revival of the true a&s;tronomy by <HI>Coper|nicus:</HI> and in a work publi&s;hed in 1604, declared, that no &s;uch thing could happen in that century; nor the next, till the year 1761. In this, however, that great man was mi&s;taken. For an Engli&s;h A&s;tronomer, <HI>Jeremiah Horrockes,</HI> then no more than 20 years of age, but of an admirable genius, having corrected <HI>Kepler's</HI> Tables by &s;ome of his own ob&s;ervations, predicted and &s;oon after ob&s;erv'd this mo&s;t rare phaenomenon, on the 24th of November O. S. in the year 1639, at <HI>Hoole,</HI> a &s;mall village about 12 miles N. from <HI>Leverpool.</HI> Having waited &s;everal hours with great impatience, he had at la&s;t the
<PB N="4" REF="009040_0003_103076CFC3827FA0">
&s;atisfaction to &s;ee the Planet as a black &s;pot, ju&s;t entring on the Sun, at a quarter pa&s;t three in the afternoon. He made three ob&s;ervations of its po&s;itions in half an hour, when he was depriv'd of a longer &s;ight of it by the &s;etting of the Sun. He had given notice to an a&s;tro|nomical friend, Mr. <HI>Crabtree,</HI> who, at a few miles di&s;tance ju&s;t got a &s;ight of it between the clouds, before Sun-&s;et. The&s;e two were the only per&s;ons that ever &s;aw Venus in the Sun, before the pre&s;ent year.</P>
<P>THESE Tran&s;its became more generally known by a <HI>Series,</HI> which the late A&s;tronomer-Royal Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> publi&s;h'd, of all in a thou|&s;and years; from which it appears that none could happen between the years 1639 and 1761. But what made this of June 6, 1761, mo&s;t of all famous, was a paper of the &s;ame learn|ed author in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions for the year 1705, wherein he explains an important u&s;e to be made of it. Some u&s;es of the tran&s;its of the inferior planets were obvious. They &s;erve much better than any other phaenomena, to perfect the theory of the&s;e planets, which is more difficult to be &s;ettled than that of the &s;uperiors; and did they happen frequently, would be of admirable u&s;e in a&s;certaining the longitude of places on this globe. They likewi&s;e demon&s;trate the truth of the Copernican Sy&s;tem, &s;o far as it relates to the&s;e Planets, by making it evident that they re&s;pect the Sun, and not the Earth, as the centre of their motions. But Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> point|ed
<PB N="5" REF="009040_0004_103076D2739E0510">
out a new and &s;ingular u&s;e to be made of the Tran&s;it of Venus; and to which no other phaenomenon in the heavens is near &s;o well adapted. This is, in finding the Parallax of the Sun; which is &s;o &s;mall that the A&s;trono|mers have never been able to di&s;cover it with exactne&s;s in any other method. If this were once known, the di&s;tance of the Sun, and of all the Planets, and of all the Comets, would be known too; and their magnitudes would al&s;o be known, from their apparent diameters. This would give us a ju&s;t idea of the va&s;t di|men&s;ions of the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, and of the mighty globes which compo&s;e it. Nor can we, but by &s;uch ob&s;ervations, know whether the Earth continues to revolve at the &s;ame di&s;tance from the Sun, or whether it gradually approaches him, as there is &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect; nor whether the Sun remains of the &s;ame magni|tude, or con&s;umes away and is dimini&s;h'd by the light which he is ince&s;&s;antly &s;ending forth. The Parallax of the Sun is al&s;o an element that enters into the calculation of eclip&s;es; and of what u&s;e the&s;e are in A&s;tronomy, in Geography, in Hi&s;tory and Chronology, is too well known to need being in&s;i&s;ted on at this day. It would likewi&s;e determine the quantity of matter in the Earth, or the proportion which this bears to that in the Sun; and &s;hew us preci&s;ely the a|mazing velocity with which light is darted from the Sun and other luminous Bodies;&mdash;and pro|bably give us a deeper in&s;ight into many of the wonderful works of GOD. For &s;uch is the
<PB N="6" REF="009040_0005_103076D476FFC1F8">
relation of the &s;everal branches of natural Phi|lo&s;ophy to each other, and of all of them to mo|ral Philo&s;ophy, that whatever tends to the per|fection of one tends to perfect the other, in proportion to the connection there is between them. And a capital point once adju&s;ted, may &s;erve for the determination of others, which were not at fir&s;t thought of. Thus, the exact mea&s;ure of a degree on the meridian enabled Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> to demon&s;trate his Theory of univer&s;al Gravity, a &s;cheme which had never enter'd into the minds of any, when the de|gree was propo&s;ed to be mea&s;ured; by which means that great man laid open the con&s;titu|tion of the a&s;tronomical world, and pointed out the fundamental Law which the alwi&s;e CREATOR has e&s;tabli&s;hed for regulating the &s;everal movements in this grand machine.</P>
<P>FROM a &s;en&s;e of the advantages to be de|rived from this Ob&s;ervation, Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> recom|mended it in the mo&s;t emphatical terms, and inforced it with all the energy of language, on the A&s;tronomers and others of the pre&s;ent day, that they would by no means let &s;lip an oppor|tunity, which he then doubted whether it would offer it &s;elf again to the people of this or the following age; and on which depended the adequate &s;olution of a Problem, in it&s;elf mo&s;t noble, and inacce&s;&s;ible any other way. And to put the matter beyond all hazard, he advi&s;ed to have a number of Ob&s;ervators &s;tation'd in dif|ferent parts of the Earth, that &s;ome of them
<PB N="7" REF="009040_0006_103076D62E8CFA18">
might be &s;ure to &s;ucceed; as a &s;ingle per&s;on might be fru&s;trated by the intervention of clouds.</P>
<P>THESE pre&s;&s;ing recommendations of the learned Doctor did not lo&s;e their effect. The approach of this phaenomenon was attended with a general curio&s;ity: It became a topic of conver&s;ation among Per&s;ons of every rank, of every profe&s;&s;ion, of every ta&s;te. It could not e&s;cape the notice of &s;ome of the greate&s;t Mo|narchs of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;urrounded, as they were, with the tumults of war. His late MAJESTY, of happy memory, attentive to the cultivation of the Arts and Sciences, tho&s;e great ornaments of civil Society;&mdash;particularly of A&s;tronomy, on which he well knew Navigation, and of con|&s;equence the commerce and wealth of his Kingdoms had a nece&s;&s;ary dependence; was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to provide for having this ob&s;ervation made in the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> as well as in his own Royal Ob&s;ervatory at home.</P>
<P>NOR was <HI>America</HI> inactive on this &s;ingu|lar occa&s;ion. His Excellency FRANCIS BER|NARD, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Governor of the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> in&s;pired with a ju&s;t zeal for the advancement of Literature, which he de|mon&s;trates on every opportunity, exerted him|&s;elf to procure an ob&s;ervation in this quarter of the world. And as <HI>Newfoundland</HI> was the only Briti&s;h Plantation in which one could be made, and indeed the mo&s;t we&s;tern part of the
<PB N="8" REF="009040_0007_103076DCDC86CF88">
Earth where the end of the Tran&s;it could be ob|&s;erv'd, for this was to happen before the Sun would be ri&s;en to any other part of <HI>America,</HI> except the Savage coa&s;t of <HI>Labrador,</HI> he propo&s;ed by a Me&s;&s;age <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">See the Appendix.</NOTE> to the General A&s;&s;embly of the Province then &s;itting at Bo&s;ton, to make pro|vi&s;ion for this purpo&s;e. The A&s;&s;embly, ani|mated with the &s;ame public Spirit, and treading in the &s;teps of their worthy Predece&s;&s;ors, who from the &s;ettlement of the Country have emi|nently di&s;tingui&s;h'd them&s;elves among the other Governments as the PATRONS OF LEARNING, readily enter'd into his Excellency's views, and pa&s;t a Vote <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">See the Appendix.</NOTE> reque&s;ting Him to order the Pro|vince-Sloop to convey me to <HI>Newfoundland</HI> on this de&s;ign. The orders were i&s;&s;ued, agree|ably; and his Excellency was plea&s;ed to give me &s;uch Letters, directed to his Maje&s;ty's Offi|cers, Commanders, and other his Subjects, and likewi&s;e to tho&s;e of the French King, as were proper to facilitate the execution of the enter|pri&s;e, and to &s;ecure it from di&s;appointment by the enemy. The Reverend the Pre&s;ident and Fellows of Harvard College, in order to pro|mote &s;o laudable an undertaking, granted their Apparatus of a&s;tronomical in&s;truments, to be imploy'd in this affair. Accordingly, I carried an excellent Pendulum clock; one of Hadley's Octants with Nonius divi&s;ions, and &s;itted in a new manner to ob&s;erve on &s;hore as well at &s;ea <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="marg">Pre&s;ented to the Apparatus la&s;t year by Ezek.

And taking with me for a&s;&s;i&s;tants two young Gentlemen my Pupils, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="marg">Me&s;&s;r's Williams and Rand.</NOTE> who had made good proficiency in mathematical &s;tudies, I embark'd at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> on board the before-mentioned ve&s;&s;el, commi&s;&s;ioned by the Gover|nor, May the 9th, and in 13 days arrived at <HI>St. John's, Newfoundland.</HI></P>
<P>THE reception I met with there was &s;uita|ble to the con&s;equence of my Commi&s;&s;ion, and the dignity of my Employers. Whatever was wanted, was &s;upplied in the mo&s;t obliging man|ner by the Gentlemen of that place; amon whom, I am under particular obligations to mention Capt. <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> Commander of his Maje|&s;ty's Garri&s;on, and <HI>Michael Gill,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Chief Judge in the Courts. With their a&s;&s;i&s;tance we were enabled to &s;urmount the difficulties which mu&s;t be expected to attend an undertaking like ours, in a country unprovided with conveni|ences for &s;uch operations. The town of <HI>St. John's</HI> being bounded with high mountains toward the Sun-ri&s;ing, &s;o that no hou&s;e in it would an&s;wer our end, we were obliged to &s;eek farther; and, after a fatiguing and fruit|le&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="009040_0009_103076E17A6641A0">
attempt or two, fix'd on an eminence at &s;ome di&s;tance, from whence we could have a view of the Sun pre&s;ently after his ri&s;ing. As this place was open, and had no building near it, we pitch'd &s;ome tents upon it for a &s;helter; which, together with our Apparatus, and &s;uch materials as we had occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of, we convey'd up thither, with the labor of &s;eve|ral days. We &s;ecured the Clock to a pillar &s;et in the ground under a large tent. Near this tent, and within call of the Clock, we fix'd two others firmly in the ground; one, to mount the refracting tele&s;cope upon; the other, which was above 8 feet high, for a Style, hav|ing at top a plate of lead with a little hole for tran&s;mitting the Sun's rays; and we laid a large horizontal Platform on the ground, to receive the&s;e rays. This Platform we kept cover'd, to defend it from the Sun and the weather; and examin'd its po&s;ition every time we made u&s;e of it, by a very long level. On this we care|fully traced a meridian line, by corre&s;pondent altitudes of the Sun, taken both with the Re|flector, and by the Sun's image on the Platform. And, in order fully to examine and verify the meridian and adju&s;t our clock, we repeated the&s;e operations every fair day, and many times in a day; and continued them with an a&s;&s;i|duity which the infinite &s;warms of in&s;ects, that were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hill, were not able to abate, tho' they per&s;ecuted us &s;everely and with|out intermi&s;&s;ion, both by day and by night, with their venemous &s;tings. It would be tedious,
<PB N="11" REF="009040_0010_103076E32CC5A798">
as well as needle&s;s, to give a detail of the ob|&s;ervations we made with this intent: 'Tis &s;uf|ficient, that we regulated the clock with as much exactne&s;s as we could have done at home.</P>
<P>THUS prepared, we waited for the critical hour, which proved favorable to our wi&s;hes. The morning of the 6th of June was &s;erene and calm, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">We have &s;ince learned, that all along &s;hore, from Cape-Race to Halifax, there was a heavy &s;torm of rain that morning.</NOTE> The Sun ro&s;e behind a cloud that lay along the horizon, but &s;oon got above it; and at 4^h 18^m we had the high &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing that mo&s;t agreable Sight, VENUS ON THE SUN, and of &s;hewing it in our tele&s;copes to the Gentlemen of the place, who had a&s;|&s;embled very early on the hill to behold &s;o curious a &s;pectacle. The Planet at fir&s;t appear'd dim thro' the cloud, but in a &s;hort time be|came more di&s;tinct and better defined. Upon this, I applied my &s;elf to take the pa&s;&s;age of the Sun's and Venus's preceding limbs by the vertical, and of their lower limbs by the hori|zontal wires in the Reflector; and made the following ob&s;ervations; one of my a&s;&s;i&s;tants counting the Clock, and the other writing down the ob&s;ervations, as I made them.</P>

<P>AS Venus began now to draw near, the Sun's limb, I prepared to ob&s;erve her egre&s;s. The in|terior contact appeared at 4^h 47^m 17^s, and the exterior at 5^h 5^m 46^s. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">IN memory of &s;o rare an ob&s;ervation, the Gentlemen pre&s;ent agreed to give the hill, where our ob&s;ervatory was &s;ituated, the name of <HI>Venus</HI>'s <HI>Hill,</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>THE above ob&s;ervations gave me &s;o many differences between the Sun's and Venus's alti|tudes and azimuths; from whence, by &s;pherical trigonometry, I deducd the Planet's right A&s;cen|&s;ions and Declinations; and from them, in the la&s;t place, her Longitudes and Latitudes. It would be neither of entertainment nor u&s;e to the Reader, to in&s;ert the particulars of &s;uch te|dious calculations: It will be enough to give the re&s;ult of the whole, or the Planet's difference in Longitude from the Sun's centre, and her La|titude, at the time of each ob&s;ervation; which came out as follow.</P>

<P>THUS in the &s;hort interval of Time that was permitted, I determin'd five po&s;itions of the Planet on the Sun; and by laying off the differences of Longitude and the Latitudes, the Planet's path over the Sun may be drawn, and its &s;ituation determin'd in re&s;pect of the ecliptic,
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="14" REF="009040_0013_103076EC635A8D68">
or any other circle of the &s;phere; as is here done for the vertical thro' the ri&s;ing Sun at <HI>St. John</HI>'s. In the Figure, the circle CZLN re|pre&s;ents the Sun; the diameter ZN, the vertical thro' his centre S; CL, the ecliptic, in its due po&s;ition with re&s;pect to this vertical at the time of &s;un-ri&s;ing at <HI>St. John</HI>'s. Then, laying off the fir&s;t ob&s;erv'd difference of Longitude on the ecliptic from S to D, and the corre&s;ponding Latitude in a perpendicular to the ecliptic from D to A, we have the place of the Planet on the Sun at the time of the fir&s;t ob&s;ervation; repre|&s;ented here by the black &s;pot at A; which al&s;o exhibits the apparent bigne&s;s of Venus in pro|portion to the Sun's; their diameters being nearly as 1 to 33. In the &s;ame manner may the other ob&s;ervations be projected; and the right line BE, drawn thro' the &s;everal points thus found, which there was not room to &s;et down in this Figure, will be the Planet's path on the Sun; in which, B is its place at the begin|ning, M at the middle, and E at the end; the numbers over the path &s;hewing Venus's place at the &s;everal hours of the night between the 5th and 6th of June.</P>
<P>FROM hence we &s;tate the times of the Tran|&s;it as it would have been &s;een at <HI>St. John</HI>'s, had the Sun been above the horizon during the whole continuance of it.

<P>IT may be further collected, that the con|junction in Longitude happen'd at 14^h 4^m 32^s in 15^d 35^m 22^s of <HI>Gemini;</HI> the Planet's Lati|tude being then 9^m 28^s. The Longitude at this conjunction differs but 27^s from the calcule I made by Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>'s Tables; and the Lati|tude but 23^s. Which &s;hews to what a degree of perfection tho&s;e tables are already carried.</P>
<P>BY &s;everal ob&s;ervations we found the Lati|tude of the place 47^d 32^m N; which falls be|tween the Latitudes &s;et down in different books and maps. No eclip&s;e of the &s;un or moon hap|pen'd while we were on the I&s;land, by which we might have determin'd the Longitude; and
<PB N="16" REF="009040_0015_103076F2EBCAC508">
Jupiter's Satellites proved of no &s;ervice in that affair; as they were not ri&s;en high enough to be ob&s;erv'd above an hour before day-light came on. There were but two eclip&s;es of them that could have been vi&s;ible during our &s;tay there; and tho' I watched for both the&s;e, I was di&s;ap|pointed of both by unfavourable weather. Nei|ther was I fortunate enough to get &s;o much as one occultation of a fix'd &s;tar by the moon, tho' I &s;pared no pains for it. On the 11th of June we made an ob&s;ervation for this purpo&s;e, by taking the difference of right a&s;cen&s;ion of the moon's preceding limb, and the middle &s;tar in the border of the garment of Virgo, the 82d of that con&s;tellation in the Britannic Catalogue; which at 9^h 29^m 51^s, we found to be 12^d 7^m 29^s. Calculating from hence, the Longitude came out 50^d 14^m W. from Greenwich; which is a little le&s;s than I had &s;uppo&s;ed it in my calcula|tions.</P>
<P>THE variation of the needle we found to be 19^d W. which is le&s;s than it is marked on the charts.</P>
<P>IN the above calculations I took the &s;emi|diameter of the Sun to be 15^m 50^s; and of Venus 29^s. This la&s;t is le&s;s than Dr. <HI>Halley,</HI> after Mr. <HI>Horrockes,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed it; but it cannot be bigger, con&s;i&s;tent with the foregoing ob&s;er|vation, which has convinced me, that Venus, in&s;tead of being equal in diameter to the Earth, according to the common opinion, is le&s;s, in the proportion of 5 to 4.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="009040_0016_103076F49FF4BD88">BY the foregoing ob&s;ervations we are now enabled to predict with certainty, what Dr. <HI>Halley,</HI> in his paper before-mentioned, only &s;u&s;|pected, that Venus will again pa&s;s over the Sun on the 3d of June in the year 1769; the for|mer part of which Tran&s;it will be vi&s;ible in our horizon for about 5^h in the afternoon, but the Sun will &s;et before it is ended. That Tran|&s;it will be more convenient for finding the Pa|rallax than the pre&s;ent has been; but not be|cau&s;e <Q>Venus will then de&s;cribe a line nearer the diameter of the Sun;</Q> which is the rea&s;on a&s;&s;ign'd in the London Magazine for June 1761. The Planet will hardly come &s;o near. The true rea&s;on is, becau&s;e Venus will then de&s;cribe a more northerly path on the Sun. After that, there will not be another Tran&s;it for above 100 years; viz. not 'till the 8th of December in the year 1874. But the whole of that will be in|vi&s;ible here; the middle happening about mid|night. The next after that, will not be in the year 1996, as it is in Dr. HALLEY's <HI>Series.</HI> This <HI>Series</HI> was founded on the old hypothe&s;is of the immobility of Venus's Nodes, which ap|pears to be erroneus. The ob&s;ervation of the late Tran&s;it has made it certain, that the&s;e Nodes have a retrograde motion, tho' a very &s;low one; which is agreable al&s;o to the Theory of Gravi|ty. And from hence it follows, that the next Tran&s;it after that of 1874 will not be till the year 2004, on the 8th of June; the latter part of which will be vi&s;ible here after &s;un-ri&s;e. How A&s;tronomy tran&s;ports us into di&s;tant Futurity!</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="009040_0017_103076F7847C3568">FROM the&s;e numbers a que&s;tion naturally ari&s;es, How it comes to pa&s;s, that there will be another Tran&s;it after &s;o &s;hort a term as 8 years, when there has not been one for above 120 years pa&s;t, nor will there be another for above 100 years after the next? This que&s;tion de&s;erves an an&s;wer. I &s;hall give it one, deduced from the fir&s;t principles, in as clear and &s;uccinct a man|ner as I am able. It is to be ob&s;erved then, that the Earth revolves round the Sun in 365 days; and Venus in 224; and moving in a &s;maller orbit included within the Earth's, &s;he may pa&s;s between the Sun and the Earth; which a&s;pect is called an inferior Conjunction. By rea&s;on of this quicker revolution, Venus mu&s;t overtake the Earth in certain intervals of time, which I find to contain 584 days; &s;o that Venus, hav|ing once pa&s;&s;ed between the Sun and the Earth, will return to pa&s;s between them in 584 days. Now if her orbit lay in the &s;ame plane with the Earth's, at every one of the&s;e inferior conjunc|tions Venus would pa&s;s <HI>between</HI> the Sun and the Earth, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word; and, her unilluminated &s;ide being then turned to the Earth, would appear to us like a black &s;pot pa&s;&s;ing over the di&s;e of the Sun. Had this been the po&s;ition of her orbit, at the end of every period of 584 days there would have been a Tran&s;it of Venus; and the Tran&s;its would all have been central, the Planet every time de&s;|cribing a diameter of the Sun. But the plane of Venus's orbit is inclined to the Earth's in an angle of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> and &s;o far might Venus be
<PB N="19" REF="009040_0018_103076F93661CC78">
&s;een to the N. or S. of the ecliptic, if view'd from the Sun; but view'd from the Earth, to which &s;he is much nearer in the inferior con|junctions, &s;he may be &s;een above 9 &frac14;^d from the ecliptic; and therefore, as the Sun's &s;emidiame|ter is but &frac14; of a degree, Venus in her inferior conjunctions may pa&s;s 9^d to the N. or S. of the Sun's limbs. This Planet can appear on the face of the Sun, only in tho&s;e inferior conjunc|tions, when her di&s;tance from the ecliptic, as &s;een from the Earth, is le&s;s than the &s;emidia|meter of the Sun. For this effect, &s;he mu&s;t be within 5^d of her Nodes, which are the two op|po&s;ite points in which her orbit cro&s;&s;es the ecliptic; and this are &s;he de&s;cribes in 3 days. About the pre&s;ent age, the Sun is in one of the&s;e Nodes on the 5th of June, and in the other on the 6th of December. So that the Tran&s;its mu&s;t happen between the 2d and 8th of June; or the 3d and 9th of December. To find at what intervals they may follow one ano|ther, we mu&s;t find when the afore&s;aid period of conjunctions, viz. 584 days, taken &s;ome number of times will amount to &s;ome number or years, within 3 days more or le&s;s: for that will bring the conjunctions to happen at the &s;ame time of the year. Now five of the&s;e periods amount to eight years, wanting two days; and this is &s;horte&s;t interval in which the Tran&s;its can fol|low one another. No other number of the&s;e periods le&s;s than 147 will an&s;wer this conditi|on; and this number amounts to 235 years.&mdash; At the end of the period of 8 years in June,
<PB N="20" REF="009040_0019_103076FCEFC8DD48">
Venus pa&s;&s;es almo&s;t 20^m more northerly than before; and as the &s;emidiameter of the Sun is near 16^m, if in a Tran&s;it in June Venus pa&s;&s;es above 4^m to the S. of the Sun's centre, there will be another Tran&s;it in 8 years; otherwi&s;e, not till 235 years. And from hence it appears, that the&s;e Tran&s;its cannot &s;ucceed one another in two con&s;ecutive periods of 8 years; for in the la&s;t of them, Venus will pa&s;s near 40^m more nor|therly than in the fir&s;t; which is more than the whole diameter of the Sun. The like may be &s;aid of the Tran&s;its at the other Node in December.&mdash;The la&s;t time this period of 8 years took place, was in 1631 and 1639; and the next time, after the pre&s;ent, will be in 2004 and 2012.</P>
<P>AS there was &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that Venus had a Satellite, partly from two ob&s;erva|tions of M. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> at Paris in the years 1672 and 1686, but principally from one that was made by Mr. <HI>Short</HI> at London on the 23d of October 1740, I entertained hopes of &s;eeing it pa&s;s over the Sun; and with this thought, view'd the Sun with great attention in the Re|flector, both on the 5th and 6th of June; but in vain. There were &s;everal &s;pots then on the Sun, but none that I &s;aw could be a Satellite.</P>
<P>TO conclude. The path of Venus, above determin'd, is her vi&s;ible path, as affected by parallax at <HI>St. John's;</HI> which will be different from her vi&s;ible path in di&s;tant parts of the
<PB N="21" REF="009040_0020_1030770110057C78">
Earth, where parallax has a different effect. This vi&s;ible path, and the apparent motion of Venus in re&s;pect of the Sun, are here rightly determin'd, even if the elements imploy'd in the calculation, &s;uch as the latitude and longi|tude of the place, and tho&s;e &s;upplied by the a&s;tronomical tables, &s;hould not be exactly &s;uch as we &s;uppo&s;ed them. Any &s;mall difference in the&s;e particulars mu&s;t equally affect the mo|tion both of the Sun and Venus; and there|fore, tho' it would alter their places in re&s;pect of the equinoctial points, it would produce no &s;en&s;ible difference in the relative motion of one to the other; nor any error in the &s;ituation of Venus in re&s;pect of the Sun. The compari&s;on of the ob&s;ervations made in the N. W. parts of the world with tho&s;e in the S. E. when all of them come to be laid toge|ther, will give the true path of Venus, ab|&s;tracted from parallax; by which means, the quantity of the parallax will at length be di&s;|covered. The right determination of which point will render this year 1761 an ever-memorable aera in the annals of a&s;tronomy.</P>
