<P>THE Governor having been informed la&s;t Week, at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> that in Con&s;e|quence of &s;everal Invitations &s;ent by this Government, at &s;undry Times, to the <HI>Indians</HI> living on and near the <HI>Ohio,</HI> the <HI>Delaware</HI> Chief <HI>Beaver,</HI> and the Deputies of other Tribes of We&s;tern <HI>Indians,</HI> would be at <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> on the Eighth In&s;tant; &s;at out from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> attended by &s;everal Gentlemen, and came here on the Ninth In|&s;tant, and found that the <HI>Indians</HI> had arrived the Evening before.</P>
<P>On the Tenth the Governor, attended by the Gentlemen abovementioned, with &s;everal of the Inhabitants of this Town, paid a Vi&s;it to <HI>Beaver,</HI> and the other <HI>Indians,</HI> at their Encamp|ment, about a Mile from the Town, where he took them by the Hand, and bid them heartily welcome; and having &s;een that they were well accommodated, took his Leave, and came back to Town.</P>
<P>The Governor Ye&s;terday Afternoon received a Me&s;&s;age from <HI>Beaver,</HI> that having been a long Time from Home, they would take it very kindly if he would be plea&s;ed to open the Conferences with them To-morrow Morning, without waiting any longer for the <HI>Six Na|tions,</HI> as he and tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> with him were the fir&s;t invited, and were only made acquainted with the coming of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> &s;ince they left their Homes.</P>
<P>The Governor returned them for An&s;wer, that the Interpreter was not come; but as &s;oon as he &s;hould arrive, he would immediately proceed to Bu&s;ine&s;s with them, and give them Notice when to attend.</P>
<P>This Afternoon arrived Six <HI>Tu&s;carora Indians,</HI> who waited on the Governor, and ac|quainted him, that they were &s;ent to him by tho&s;e of their Nation, living at <HI>Onohoquage,</HI> on the Upper Waters of the <HI>Sa&s;quehannah,</HI> with a Letter; which, after the Ceremony of open|ing his Eyes and Heart, by a String of Wampum, they delivered to him, and it follows in the&s;e Words.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Lower Tu&s;carora, Onohoquage, July</HI> 8, 1762.</P>
<P><HI>Great Brother,</HI></P>
<P>"I the Bearer, <HI>Augus,</HI> Chief of the Nation, am, and ever have been, a Friend and Brother to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and to the Intere&s;t of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> now wait upon your Excel|lency, by Agreement, to tran&s;act Affairs of Importance; and heartily rejoice that the <HI>Five Nations</HI> have agreed to, and (as I hear) have actually returned the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners, to enjoy the Liberties of their own Nation.&mdash;And I the &s;aid <HI>Augus,</HI> Chief, with my whole Tribe, have ever been for Peace with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> and have minded the Things of Religion, and of a private Life. And as true Friends to the Prote&s;tant Cau&s;e, we congratulate your Excellency, our Brother, and all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, on the various Con|que&s;ts obtained again&s;t the common Enemy, and e&s;pecially on the total Reduction of <HI>Canada,</HI> with its Dependences, being greatly delighted with the happy Pro&s;pect that now ari&s;es, with|out Clouds. As we rejoice to hear that the Pri&s;oners are re&s;igned, &s;o we hope a Peace will
<PB N="4" REF="009412_0003_0F7404D2CA1C0EF8" MS="y">be e&s;tabli&s;hed between us, the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colonies on the Continent; a Peace that &s;hall be la&s;ting and undi&s;turbed, while the Waters run, and the Gra&s;s grows.&mdash;We &s;hould be glad to be informed of the State and Behaviour of our Brethren in <HI>Tu&s;carora Valley,</HI> and to have &s;ome Directions about the Way, as we propo&s;e to make them a Vi&s;it; and al&s;o &s;hould be glad of a Pa&s;s, or Recommendation in Writing, that we may be friendly received on the Way, and at the Valley.</P>
<P><HI>I am your Brother, AUGUS, Chief."</HI></P>
<P>The above was taken from the Mouth of the &s;aid <HI>Augus, Tu&s;carora</HI> Chief, by the Help of an Interpreter, by me <HI>ELI FORBES, Mi&s;&s;ionary at</HI> Onchoquage.</P>
<P>After the Governor had read the Letter, they delivered him a Belt of Wampum, to con|firm the Sincerity of their Profe&s;&s;ions contained in the &s;aid Letter.</P>
<P>They then delivered the Governor another Belt from the <HI>Nanticokes</HI> and <HI>Conoys,</HI> as a Te|&s;timony of their joining with the <HI>Tu&s;caroras</HI> in the &s;ame &s;incere Profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Governor acquainted them that he would take the Letter into Con&s;ideration, and at a proper Time return them an An&s;wer.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren</HI> the <HI>Delawares, Shawane&s;e, Twightwees, Wawachtanies, Tu&s;caroras,</HI> and <HI>Kick|apoes,</HI></P>
<P>With this String I clean your Bodies from the Du&s;t and Sweat, and open your Eyes and Ears, that you may &s;ee your Brethren with Chearfulne&s;s, and hear di&s;tinctly what I have to &s;ay to you at this Conference.</P>
<P><HI>A String</HI> (480)</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>With this String I open the Pa&s;&s;age to your Hearts, that you may &s;peak freely, and with|out Re&s;erve, as Brethren ought to do when they meet together.</P>
<P><HI>A String</HI> (260)</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="009412_0004_0F7404D3796E2600">
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It is now a great while &s;ince we have had the Plea&s;ure of meeting one another in Council, wherefore I take this Opportunity of condoling with you for the Lo&s;&s;es you may have &s;u&s;tained by the Death of any of your People, and with this String I gather up the Bones of our de|cea&s;ed Brethren, and bury them decently, according to the Cu&s;tom of our Forefathers.</P>
<P><HI>A String</HI> (460)</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>With this String I di&s;per&s;e the dark Clouds, which for many Years have hung over our Heads, and prevented our &s;eeing each other, that we may for the future meet and confer to|gether, as our Fathers u&s;ed to do, and brighten and renew the Covenant Chain of Friend&s;hip, for our mutual Benefit and Advantage.</P>
<P><HI>A String</HI> (300)</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As the Council-Chamber hath contracted much Du&s;t, for Want of U&s;e for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, and hath al&s;o been &s;tained with Blood, I, with this String, &s;weep it quite clean, and wipe all Blood from off the Seats, that we may &s;it down and confer together, without &s;eeing any Thing to interrupt us, or make us unea&s;y.</P>
<P><HI>A String</HI> (280)</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Having now wiped your Eyes, opened the Way to your Hearts, and clean&s;ed the Council Seats, I, by this Belt, take you by the Hand, and bid you heartily welcome, and a&s;&s;ure you, that I am ready to do every Thing in my Power to &s;trengthen and pre&s;erve that Brotherly Love and Friend&s;hip, which &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between your Ance&s;tors and His Maje&s;ty's Sub|jects of this Government.</P>
<P>A Belt.</P>
<P>The Governor then told them he had fini&s;hed what he had to &s;ay to them at pre&s;ent, and that if they were prepared to &s;peak to him at this Time, he was ready to hear them; if not, he would appoint another Time for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Beaver, <HI>the Chief of the</HI> Delawares, <HI>then &s;poke to the Governor as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We all rejoice to hear what you have &s;aid to us, and are glad that you have clean&s;ed us, and have &s;poke to us in the Manner which our Forefathers u&s;ed to do to one another. As we &s;peak different Languages, we &s;hall be glad of an Opportunity of con&s;ulting among our&s;elves, and &s;hall deliver what we have to &s;ay to you To-morrow Morning.</P>

<P>I HAVE heard what you &s;aid to me Ye&s;terday, and am well plea&s;ed with it. You have clean&s;ed me, opened my Eyes, and cleaned my Ears in the &s;ame Manner as our Fore|fathers u&s;ed to do. You will now li&s;ten to me attentively; with this String I al&s;o open your Eyes, and clean your Ears, that you may &s;ee me, and hear what I have to &s;ay to you.</P>

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>When our Grandfathers u&s;ed to meet together, they wiped the Tears from one anothers Eyes, and with this String I now wipe the Tears from your Eyes, that you may &s;ee clearly your Brothers now before you.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="009412_0005_0F7404D43A220CB0">
<HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>When our Grandfathers u&s;ed to meet our Brethren, they clean&s;ed each others Hearts, and took away all Grief and Sorrow out of them:&mdash;By this String I do likewi&s;e clean your Hearts, and remove all Sorrow and Grief from them, and &s;trengthen your Breath, that you may &s;peak more freely to your Brothers here before you.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>It is a great While &s;ince we &s;aw one another; we here pre&s;ent are really very glad to &s;ee you and all our Brethren well.&mdash;It is about four Years ago &s;ince we fir&s;t received any Me&s;&s;a|ges from you, and ever &s;ince we have been employed in carrying good News to all the Na|tions round, who were rejoiced to hear it from you. And we have been likewi&s;e ever &s;ince endeavouring to bring in your Fle&s;h and Blood, as you required it of us. Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> and the Commander at <HI>Fort-Pitt,</HI> know that we have delivered many of them, and now we bring a few more of them to you. There are &s;ome behind yet, and they meet with good U&s;age, and live as we do, and chu&s;e to &s;tay with us; but I hope they will come to you after &s;ome Time, becau&s;e you live better than we do.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I heard you Ye&s;terday, and was much rejoiced to hear you, as were all your Brethren here pre&s;ent. You told me you had removed all the dark Clouds that hung over us. I am rejoiced that the dark Clouds are di&s;per&s;ed, &s;o that we can &s;ee one another clearly.</P>
<P>By this Belt I do, on my Part, di&s;per&s;e the Clouds. Now, Brother, let us join heartily, and put our Hands together, to put away the Clouds.</P>
<P>If we &s;hould &s;ee the Clouds ri&s;e again, let us join to remove them, and keep Peace toge|ther, &s;o that our Children and Grandchildren, when they meet, may rejoice to &s;ee one ano|ther, and live to great Ages in Peace.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We are rejoiced to &s;ee one another; all the dark Clouds are now &s;cattered, and the Sun &s;hines clear upon us, and all the Nations who are our Friends. We &s;ee plainly that good Road which our Grandfathers u&s;ed, when they travelled to your Council Fire, to con&s;ult about our Affairs, when we lived in Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We will join with you to keep that Road open and good; I a&s;&s;ure you it was never yet quite &s;topt up; we find our old Council Fire, which our Grandfathers made, is &s;till burning; now by this Belt I collect dry Wood to put to the Fire, and make it bigger, &s;o that the Smoke may ri&s;e to the Skies; when other Nations &s;ee it, they will know by the Light that I have been in Council with my Brethren.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Beaver <HI>then got up, and holding a Belt in his Hand, &s;aid,</HI></P>
<P>This Belt we received la&s;t Fall from Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> at <HI>Fort-Detroit,</HI> who then in|formed us, that he had heard of the good Work of Peace in which we had been engaged with our Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> which Belt repre&s;ents us, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> in the Middle, and the We&s;tern Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> at one End, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at the other, Hand in Hand, together holding fa&s;t the Chain of Friend&s;hip; and a&s;&s;ured us, that if we held this Chain of Friend&s;hip fa&s;t, our Children and Grandchildren &s;hould grow up, and live to great Ages.&mdash;We were &s;o plea&s;ed with this, that we put it into our Hearts, and have always kept it there till now.</P>
<P>And now, Brother, you have heard from me what pa&s;&s;ed between Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> and me.&mdash;I a&s;&s;ure you I will actually do what was de&s;ired of me, and hold fa&s;t this Chain of Friend&s;hip. I a&s;&s;ure you I will always do my Part in keeping this Friend&s;hip firm, and the Nations to the We&s;tward will do the &s;ame. I de&s;ire all you, my Brethren, will be &s;trong, and join heartily in keeping this Friend&s;hip alive; which if you do, you and your Grand|children &s;hall arrive at a great Age.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I de&s;ire you will take Pity on tho&s;e of our Brothers that live or come among&s;t you, and be kind to them. Our Brethren live among you, becau&s;e they love you. When any of our Brothers the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> come among&s;t us, we always take Pity on them, and give them Victuals, to make their Bodies &s;trong; and we de&s;ire that you will do the &s;ame to &s;uch of us as come among&s;t you, or live with you.</P>

<HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have no more to &s;ay at pre&s;ent; I &s;hall wait to hear what you have to &s;ay to us at ano|ther Time. You de&s;ired me to bring other Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> with me, and I have brought them a great Way, who al&s;o wait to hear what you have to &s;ay.</P>

<P>FRIDAY, AUGUST 13, 1762. This Afternoon <HI>Tokahaion,</HI> and a Number of the <HI>Six Nation Indians</HI> coming to Town, about Fifteen of them waited on the Governor, at his Lodg|ings, and <HI>Tokahaion</HI> &s;poke to the Governor as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We were &s;ome Time ago invited by you, and our Brethren the <HI>Quakers</HI> of this Province, to come to this Treaty at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> with our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares.</HI> Agreeable to this Invitation, we came down as far as <HI>Harris</HI>'s Ferry, where we heard that you intended to re|turn Home To-morrow, which induced us to make all the Ha&s;te we could to this Place, that we might have the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you. On our Way one of our Brethren died, but our Hurry was &s;o great that we threw his Body a&s;ide, and did not &s;o much as &s;tay to bury him. We are ju&s;t come to Town, and pay you this Vi&s;it to take you by the Hand, and let you know we are glad to &s;ee you. We mu&s;t reque&s;t of you to order your People to lock up all Rum, and not let our <HI>Indians</HI> have any, till the End of our Conferences.&mdash;He added, that they had &s;een the Cabbins which had been built to accommodate them, but that they were at &s;o great a Di&s;tance from the Place where their Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares</HI> were lodged, that they could not conveniently di&s;cour&s;e with them; wherefore he de&s;ired that others might be provided near to them To-morrow.</P>
<P>The Governor took them by the Hand, and after bidding them welcome, told them that they were mi&s;informed re&s;pecting his de&s;igning to return Home To-morrow; that as he heard they were on their Way, he had waited &s;ome Days, in Expectation of their coming, and was now glad to &s;ee them; that he would do every Thing in his Power, during their Stay here, to render their Situation ea&s;y and agreeable to them, and would give &s;trict Orders that no Rum &s;hould be &s;old to them; that the Field where the <HI>Delawares</HI> were encamped, being too &s;mall to accommodate them, he had pitched on a Place which he judged mo&s;t convenient, where Cabbins had been built, by his Order, for their Reception, at a con&s;iderable Expence of Time and Money, which he hoped they would be well plea&s;ed with; but if, on Trial, they &s;hould &s;till be di&s;&s;atisfied with that Situation, he would remove them where they thought mo&s;t proper; and that when they had re&s;ted them&s;elves, after the Fatigues of the long Journey they had come, he would &s;peak to them, and give them &s;ufficient Notice of the Time, that they might be prepared to meet him in Council.&mdash;They were refre&s;hed with a Draught of Beer, and then took their Leaves, and departed.</P>

<P>THE Governor &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and tho&s;e that came along with them, to acquaint them, that he was going into Conference with the We&s;tern Na|tions, at which they might be pre&s;ent, if they plea&s;ed; and on their coming in, and taking their Seats, the Governor &s;poke to the We&s;tern <HI>Indians</HI> as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren</HI> the <HI>Delawares, Shawane&s;e, Twightwees, Wawachtanies, Tu&s;caroras,</HI> and <HI>Kick|apoes,</HI></P>
<P>I return you Thanks for your Speeches of Ye&s;terday, which were very agreeable to me; and I &s;hall now give you an An&s;wer to &s;uch Parts thereof as require one.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Before I take Notice of what you &s;aid Ye&s;terday, let me remind you of the &s;trict Friend|&s;hip which was e&s;tabli&s;hed with your Forefathers, by our old Proprietor <HI>William Penn,</HI> on his fir&s;t Arrival in this Country, and how happily it &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them and their Chil|dren, till the Troubles which unfortunately broke out &s;ome few Years ago, and &s;topt up the Road between us. The many Me&s;&s;ages which we have &s;ince, from Time to Time, &s;ent you, by <HI>Frederick Po&s;t</HI> and <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> and the great Pains we have taken to drive away the Evil Spirit, plainly &s;hew how &s;incerely we have been di&s;po&s;ed to renew that Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="009412_0008_0F7404D6B5E47E58">
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You acquainted me, that after receiving our fir&s;t Me&s;&s;age about Place, which was about four Years ago, you made it known to all the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations on this Side, and over the Lakes, who were glad to hear the good News; and as we de&s;ired you to deliver up our Fle&s;h and Blood, you &s;ay that you have, from Time to Time, delivered up many at <HI>Fort-Pitt,</HI> to the Commanding Officer, and to Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> and that you now have brought in a few, which you delivered to me Ye&s;terday. You likewi&s;e &s;ay, you have yet others in your Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and that &s;ome of them chu&s;e to live with you; but you made no Doubt of their coming to us &s;ome Time hence; as we live better than the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>For the Pri&s;oners that you have delivered at <HI>Fort-Pitt,</HI> as well as for tho&s;e you have now brought along with you, and delivered to me, I return you my hearty Thanks; but you mu&s;t remember, that on re-e&s;tabli&s;hing and renewing the antient Chain of Friend&s;hip with us, you repeatedly engaged to deliver us all our Fle&s;h and Blood, which you have taken from us, by the In&s;tigation of the Evil Spirit. On the&s;e A&s;&s;urances and Engagements we have relied, and as we cannot enjoy the Ble&s;&s;ings we expected from that Peace, till the Parents and Relations of tho&s;e Pri&s;oners have them re&s;tored to them, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on your taking every Mea&s;ure in your Power to deliver them up, agreeable to your Engagements, which will be the only Means of &s;trengthening and e&s;tabli&s;hing a la&s;ting Peace, to us and our Children, yet unborn.</P>
<P><HI>A large Belt of Thirteen Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You Ye&s;terday, by this Belt, &s;aid you would join with me in di&s;per&s;ing the dark Clouds, which have for &s;ome Time hung over our Heads; and de&s;ired I would join with you, in hearty Endeavours to prevent any more Clouds from ri&s;ing, or if they &s;hould chance to ri&s;e, from coming to an Head.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>GOD, who made all Things, has given us Eyes to &s;ee, and Tongues to &s;peak to each other, freely and openly; and I a&s;&s;ure you, if I &s;hould &s;ee any little Clouds ari&s;e, at never &s;o great a Di&s;tance, I will take every Mea&s;ure in my Power to prevent their encrea&s;ing, and communicate it to you forthwith; and if you do the &s;ame to me, at all Times, it will prevent any Clouds from gathering to an Head, &s;o as to di&s;turb the public Peace and Tranquility, which have been lately &s;o happily e&s;tabli&s;hed between us.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Seven Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It gave me great Satisfaction Ye&s;terday, to hear you declare your Intentions to keep open the Council Road between your Nation and us. As a &s;mall Interruption on that Communi|cation may be attended with dangerous Con&s;equences to us both, I heartily join with you in keeping the Road open, and perfectly clear from Ob&s;tructions, for our mutual U&s;e and Advantage.</P>
<P>I likewi&s;e take it kind in you to heap up dry Wood on our Council Fire, and I, on my Part, &s;hall &s;till add more Wood to it, that the Smoke thereof may be &s;een by the mo&s;t di|&s;tant Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> to the Sun-&s;etting, that are in Friend&s;hip with His Maje&s;ty's Subjects.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Nine Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Ye&s;terday you &s;hewed me a Belt, with the Figures of three Men in it, which you &s;ay you received from Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> la&s;t Fall, at the Conference he held with all the We&s;tern Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> at <HI>Fort-Detroit,</HI> repeating what he &s;aid to you on it; all which Tran&s;|actions there I am acquainted with, by Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> who, as His Maje&s;ty's Superin|tendant of <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, did then renew the antient Covenant Chain of Friend&s;hip, in Be|half of all His Maje&s;ty's Subjects, with all tho&s;e We&s;tern Nations of <HI>Indians.</HI> You &s;ay further, that &s;ince you received that Covenant Belt, you laid it clo&s;e to your Heart; and, by this Belt, you a&s;&s;ure me that you, and all the We&s;tern Nations, are determined to adhere &s;trictly to that Treaty and Renewal of Friend&s;hip; and de&s;ire me to be &s;trong, and hold it fa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You mu&s;t remember, that you then not only promi&s;ed Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> to deliver up all our Fle&s;h and Blood, who were Pri&s;oners in your &s;everal Towns and Countries; but that this Promi&s;e was an expre&s;s Condition of that Treaty, made between him and you. This Matter lies &s;o near to my Heart, that I &s;hould not act as your true and &s;incere Friend, if I did not &s;peak with the greate&s;t Freedom and Plainne&s;s to you about it, and tell you again, that it is impo&s;&s;ible we can look upon you as our Brethren, if you detain from as our Fle&s;h and Blood; we cannot &s;leep quietly in our Beds, till we &s;ee them all; our very Dreams are di&s;turbed on their Account; we demand of you nothing more than the Right which God and Nature has given us.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="009412_0009_0F7404D736E70208">
If we had among us ever &s;o few of your Children, would you think that any Profe&s;&s;ions of Friend&s;hip we could make to you were &s;incere, if we withheld them from you but for one Day? Your Brother <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> may remember, that at our fir&s;t con&s;ering with him, at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> we had then one of your People in Pri&s;on, and he thought it &s;o grievous a Thing, that he told us he could not &s;peak freely to us, and &s;hould look upon what we &s;aid as coming not from our Hearts, but from our Mouths only, until the &s;aid Pri&s;oner was re&s;tored to him; which was immediately done. Can you then delay doing us that Ju&s;tice, which you your|&s;elves expected and received from us! We do not well under&s;tand your Meaning, when you &s;ay, &s;ome of the Pri&s;oners chu&s;e to live with you. If you intend it as a Rea&s;on for not deliver|ing them up, till they con&s;ent to come, we mu&s;t inform you, that we cannot admit of it. They were born Subjects of our Great King, and as &s;uch, he has a Right to demand them. You have, it is true, by the Delivery of &s;ome of the Pri&s;oners, performed your Agreement in Part; but as we know, and you acknowledge, there are a great many yet behind, we now in&s;i&s;t po&s;itively, that you do not fail, immediately on your Return, to collect every one that remains among you, and deliver them up to us. Relying therefore on your Hone&s;ty, and that you will faithfully comply with an Engagement you have &s;o &s;olemnly made with us, I do, by this Belt, in Behalf of all His Maje&s;ty's Subjects of this Province, lay Hold of that Covenant Belt, and will keep it fa&s;t, that we, our Children, and Grandchildren, may long enjoy the Ble&s;&s;ings of Peace, and live together as Brethren, tilt they are old Men.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Fifteen Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I thank you for the kind Entertainment which you always give to any of our People who live with you, or come among you. I am per&s;uaded, that &s;uch of you who have either lived or come among&s;t us occa&s;ionally, have always found that we received and treated them with the &s;ame Kindne&s;s that we u&s;ed to do. We are Brethren, and while we live and love like Brethren, we &s;hall be &s;ure to give one another a Share of what we have.</P>

<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>So long a Journey as you have now taken mu&s;t have been very fatiguing, and made your Bodies very dirty; with this String therefore I clean your Bodies, and wipe off all the Sweat and Dirt from them.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As you came along, you mu&s;t have hurt your Feet with the Stones, and torn your Legs with the Bu&s;hes and Briars; I therefore apply &s;ome healing Oil to them, and make them well.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>With this String I open your Eyes, and clean your Ears, that you may &s;ee your Brethren clearly, and hear di&s;tinctly what they &s;hall have to &s;ay to you.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>With this String I clear your Throats, and open the Pa&s;&s;age to your Hearts, that we may confer together freely and affectionately, as our Forefathers u&s;ed to do.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Having now clean&s;ed your Bodies, opened your Eyes and Ears, cleared your Throats, and made a Pa&s;&s;age to your Hearts, I am now ready and di&s;po&s;ed to hear every Thing that you have to &s;ay to me.</P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> Thomas King <HI>&s;tood up, and &s;poke as follows,</HI> viz.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We are well plea&s;ed to hear what you have &s;aid to us, and as we are of different Nations, and &s;peak different Languages, we &s;hall take Time to con&s;ider and explain what you have

<P>I take this Opportunity to acquaint you, that all our Guns, Hatchets, and other Things, are out of Repair, and we beg you will give Orders that they may be forthwith mended.</P>

<P>The Governor granted them their Reque&s;t, and told them their Guns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould be mended, and de&s;ired that they might be brought to the Council Hou&s;e, for that Purpo&s;e.</P>

<P><HI>Then</HI> Cleghiccon <HI>&s;poke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The Day before Ye&s;terday you &s;poke to me, and I have heard you, and we your Brethren, the We&s;tern <HI>Indians,</HI> have all been con&s;ulting about it.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I now inform you, in Behalf of my Grandchildren, the <HI>Tawwas,</HI> they have none of your Fle&s;h and Blood left in their Towns, for they have delivered them all up to you: Likewi&s;e in Behalf of my Grandchildren, the <HI>Twightwees,</HI> they have delivered them all up al&s;o, and have none left; Al&s;o on Behalf of the <HI>Wawaghtanies,</HI> they have none of your Pri&s;oners, for they have al&s;o delivered them all up: And la&s;tly, on Behalf of another Nation, called the <HI>Kickapoes,</HI> they &s;ay they never had any Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The Day before Ye&s;terday I heard what you &s;aid, and I a&s;&s;ure you I am very well plea&s;ed with it. From what you have &s;aid, I &s;uppo&s;e this Matter of the Pri&s;oners to be the principal Bu&s;ine&s;s for which you invited us here.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have told you I left &s;ome of your Fle&s;h and Blood where I came from, and I a&s;&s;ure you I look upon them as my own Fle&s;h and Blood, and I a&s;&s;ure you again, you &s;hall &s;ee them &s;ome Time hence.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I am very well plea&s;ed that you have demanded them now, and a&s;&s;ure you, you &s;hall have every one of them that remain with us.</P>

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>This is all I have to &s;ay to you. We, the We&s;tern <HI>Indians,</HI> have nothing further to &s;ay to you. You know that we &s;poke three Days ago to you, about the Friend&s;hip between us.</P>

<P>You have heard what I had to &s;ay la&s;t Fall: <HI>George Croghan</HI> knows it, and I &s;uppo&s;e you know it. I told him then, that I would cut all the Pri&s;oners loo&s;e, and &s;et them at Liberty.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have heard what you &s;aid to my Grandfathers, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> re&s;pecting the Demand of your Fle&s;h and Blood, and I am very well plea&s;ed with your Demand; and I now a&s;&s;ure you I am in a Hurry to get Home, for they, your Fle&s;h and Blood, yet remain there.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have heard what you &s;aid. Now I &s;hall depart very &s;oon. I expect to meet my People, and all the Pri&s;oners, at <HI>Pitt&s;burgh,</HI> where I &s;hall deliver them up, and you &s;hall then hear what I &s;hall have further to &s;ay to you.</P>

<P>I now want to mention &s;omething to you about our Trade with you.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We of the <HI>Shawane&s;e Twightwees, Ottaways, Wawaghtanies,</HI> and <HI>Kiekapoes,</HI> de&s;ire you will take Pity on us. Our Chief Men at Home have their Eyes on us Boys, who came with our Grandfathers, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> to talk with you about Friend&s;hip. We have now con|cluded our Friend&s;hip with you.

<P>THE Governor, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>Beaver,</HI> and the <HI>Delawares</HI> from the <HI>Ohio,</HI> &s;poke as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Li&s;ten to me, while I give you an An&s;wer to the Speeches that you made to me on <HI>Monday.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="009412_0012_0F7404DB030CC300">
You &s;poke to me in Behalf of your Grandchildren, the <HI>Tawwas, Twightwees, Wawaghta|nies,</HI> and <HI>Kickapoes,</HI> acquainting me that they had re&s;pectively delivered up all our People, who were Pri&s;oners in their Towns during the War</P>
<P><HI>Brether,</HI></P>
<P>Let them know, that we e&s;teem this as the greate&s;t Mark they could have given us of the Sincerity of their Friend&s;hip, and by this Belt we return them our hearty Thanks.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You told us that our demanding the Pri&s;oners at this Time, and in the Manner we have done it, was very agreeable to you; and you &s;uppo&s;ed it was the principal Bu&s;ine&s;s for which we invited you here.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You judge right, in thinking that the Affair of our Pri&s;oners was a principal Rea&s;on of our inviting you here; it really was &s;o, for we had it very much at Heart.</P>
<P>Another Rea&s;on of our de&s;iring to &s;ee you was, that we might renew our antient Friend|&s;hip, and brighten and &s;trengthen the Covenant Chain, which &s;o long and happily &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between our Ance&s;tors. This la&s;t has now been done to our mutual Satisfaction, and it has given me, and all the good People pre&s;ent, the highe&s;t Plea&s;ure to hear from your own Mouths that, agreeable to our Demand, you are determined to deliver up all the Pri&s;oners that remain in your Towns, to &s;uch Per&s;ons as I &s;hall appoint to receive them, at <HI>Pitt&s;burgh.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have not yet concluded upon the Per&s;ons to be &s;ent to <HI>Pitt&s;burgh,</HI> for that Purpo&s;e, but you may be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall very &s;oon; who, when they come, will bring with them a Me&s;|&s;age and full Credentials from me; by which you will know, that they are deputed by me to receive the Pri&s;oners from you. I propo&s;e they &s;hall be at <HI>Pitt&s;burgh</HI> the Second Day of <HI>October</HI> next, by which Time I expect you will have collected all of them, and brought them to that Place.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hall now return an An&s;wer to your Grandchildren the <HI>Shawane&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren the,</HI> Shawane&s;e,</P>
<P>You told me, at your la&s;t Meeting, that you were plea&s;ed to hear what had pa&s;&s;ed between us and your Grandfathers, and with our having cleaned the Council Chamber, which you &s;aid you would always a&s;&s;i&s;t in keeping clean. You told us al&s;o, that your Chief Men are not here, but have deputed you to &s;peak for them, and that what you &s;hall &s;ay comes from their Hearts.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As we have been very &s;incere and open in every Thing we have &s;aid to your Grandfathers, we &s;hould have been glad that more of your Chiefs had been here, to have heard it; but as they are not, we de&s;ire you will acquaint them, and all your Nation, that we are extreamly well di&s;po&s;ed towards them, and are determined to hold fa&s;t the Chain of Friend&s;hip that has been &s;o happily renewed between us, and are glad to hear you will always readily a&s;&s;i&s;t us to keep the Council Chamber clean.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You told me that you had &s;ent me Word la&s;t Fall, by Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> that you would cut all the Bands of the Pri&s;oners loo&s;e, and &s;et them at Liberty; that you were plea&s;ed to hear the Demand I made of your Grandfathers, that they might all be delivered up; that you expect to meet your People, and all the Pri&s;oners, at <HI>Pitt&s;burgh,</HI> where you will deliver them; and that you are in a Hurry to go Home, for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> delivered me your Me&s;&s;age la&s;t Fall, and I was very well plea&s;ed to hear you had concluded to &s;et out People at Liberty; and I am the more &s;o, to hear that you expect your People may be on the Way to <HI>Pitt&s;burgh,</HI> with the Pri&s;oners, and that you will deliver them up immediately; and your de&s;iring to return Home forthwith, for that Purpo&s;e, con|vinces me you are in earne&s;t, and I much approve of it.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You de&s;ired we would open a Trade with you, and the other We&s;tern Nations, and not be too hard in our dealing with them. I mu&s;t addre&s;s my An&s;wer not only to you, but to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and all pre&s;ent, who I de&s;ire may li&s;ten attentively to it.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="009412_0013_0F7404DBB7A76408" MS="y">
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Trade is a Bu&s;ine&s;s of Importance, and what I intended to mention to you all at this Meet|ing. You know that, for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, this Government hath kept a great Store at <HI>Pitt&s;|burgh,</HI> in order to &s;upply you with Goods, in Exchange for your Skins and Furs, near your own Homes. Good Men have been appointed to regulate the Prices of our Goods, and your Skins, and great Care has been taken that you &s;hould not be cheated, or impo&s;ed upon, by tho&s;e who have, from Time to Time, kept the Provincial Store; but I am &s;orry to inform you, that the Charges of carrying our Goods, and bringing back your Skins, &s;o many Hun|dred Miles, on Hor&s;eback, are &s;o high, that it is a great Di&s;couragement to that Trade, and we lo&s;e a great Deal of Money by it every Year, in&s;omuch that I &s;ear it will drop, unle&s;s your Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> will con&s;ent to let us go, with our Canoes, up the We&s;t Branch of <HI>Sa&s;quehannah,</HI> as far as we can, and build a few Store-hou&s;es on the Banks of that River, to &s;ecure our Goods in, as we pa&s;s and re-pa&s;s. This will cut off a long Land Carriage, and may be a Means of encouraging the Continuance of the Trade with you, and enabling our People to &s;ell their Goods to you at a rea&s;onable Rate.&mdash;We intend to &s;peak to your Uncles on this Subject.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have now fini&s;hed my An&s;wers to your &s;everal Speeches, but I have &s;till &s;omething parti|cularly to &s;ay to <HI>Beaver,</HI> and our Brethren of the <HI>Delaware</HI> Nation, living at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> and de&s;ire you will attend to me.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren the</HI> Delawares,</P>
<P>I take this Opportunity to inform you, that about Six Years ago your Brother <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> made a Complaint again&s;t the Proprietaries, wherein he charged them with defrauding the <HI>Delawares</HI> of a Tract of Land, lying on the River <HI>Delaware,</HI> between <HI>Tohiccon-Creck</HI> and the <HI>Kittatinny Hills.</HI> He alledged, that this Complaint was not made by him, on his own Account, but on Behalf of the Owners of the Land, many of whom, he &s;aid, lived at <HI>Allegheny.</HI> This Di&s;pute, Brethren, was, by mutual Con&s;ent, refered to our Great King GEORGE, who ordered Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> to enquire fully into the Matter, and make his Report to Him, that Ju&s;tice might be done you, if you had been wronged. Accordingly Sir <HI>William,</HI> about two Months ago, came to <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> where, on the Proprietaries Commi&s;&s;ioners producing and reading &s;undry Writings and Papers, <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> was convinced of his Error, and acknow|ledged that he had been mi&s;taken with Regard to the Charge of Forgery made again&s;t the Proprietaries, having been mi&s;informed by his Ance&s;tors, and de&s;ired that all further Di&s;putes about Land &s;hould be buried under Ground, and never heard of more; offering that &s;uch of the <HI>Indians</HI> as were then pre&s;ent &s;hould &s;ign a Relea&s;e for the Land in Que&s;tion, and that he would endeavour to per&s;uade the re&s;t of his Brethren who were concerned to do the &s;ame at this Treaty at <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI> Now, Brethren of <HI>Allegheny,</HI> as we are Face to Face, be plain, and tell whether you are &s;atisfied with, and approve of, what was done at the la&s;t Treaty at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> and whether you lay any Claim to tho&s;e Lands, that there may be no Room left for any future Di&s;pute about it among our Children.</P>
<P><HI>A &s;mall Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To which</HI> Beaver <HI>&s;aid,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>As to my own Part, I know nothing about the Lands upon the River <HI>Delaware;</HI> but &s;ince you reque&s;t it, I will fir&s;t &s;peak to my own People about it.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Beaver</HI> con&s;ulting with his Coun&s;ellors, returned the following An&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge I know nothing about the Lands upon the <HI>Delaware,</HI> and I have no Concern with Lands upon that River. We know nothing of the <HI>Delawares</HI> Claim to them. I have no Claim my&s;elf, nor any of my People. I &s;uppo&s;e there may be &s;ome Spots or Pieces of Land, in &s;ome Parts of the Province, that the <HI>Delawares</HI> claim; but neither I nor any of my People know any Thing of them. As to what you and our Brother <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> have done, if you are both plea&s;ed, I am plea&s;ed with it. As to my Part, I want to &s;ay nothing about Land Affairs; what I have at Heart, and what I came down about, is to confirm our Friend&s;hip, and make a la&s;ting Peace, &s;o as our Children and Grandchildren may live toge|ther in everla&s;ting Peace, after we are dead.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> and his <HI>Delawares</HI> being pre&s;ent, &s;omething pa&s;&s;ed between them, which was not interpreted.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to</HI> Beaver, <HI>&s;aid,</HI></P>
<P>I am very much plea&s;ed with what you have &s;aid; you &s;peak like an hone&s;t Man, and I hope that the Friend&s;hip that has been made between us and our Brethren, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> will remain firm, as long as the Sun &s;hines, and the Rivers run.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="009412_0014_0F7404DC78C67838" MS="y">
Teedyu&s;cung <HI>then &s;tood up, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Governor, &s;aid,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Before all the&s;e <HI>Allegheny Indians</HI> here pre&s;ent, I do now a&s;&s;ure you, that I am ready and willing to &s;ign a Relea&s;e to all the Lands we have been di&s;puting about, as I told you I would at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> and de&s;ire no more may be ever &s;aid or heard of them hereafter.</P>
<P>On which the Governor told <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> that he was plea&s;ed with what he had &s;aid, and that on that Occa&s;ion he had acted like an hone&s;t Man.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor then concluded.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Your Brothers, the Proprietaries, about three Years ago, directed me, as &s;oon as <HI>Teedyu&s;|cung</HI>'s Complaint again&s;t them was determined, and Ju&s;tice done to their Characters, to make their old Friends, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> a Pre&s;ent, in their Name, to &s;upply your Wai&s;ts, and as a Mark of their Affection and Regard for you, and to convince you that they had no ill Will in their Hearts again&s;t you, but looked upon you as formerly to be their good Friends and Brothers. Now as that Di&s;pute is happily at an End, I am at Liberty to follow their Directions, and &s;hall accordingly order a Pre&s;ent of Goods to be delivered to you from the Proprietaries.</P>

<P>PRESENT, <HI>The Honourable</HI> JAMES HAMILTON, <HI>E&s;quire, &amp;c. &amp;c. as before.</HI></P>
<P>THOMAS KING, a Chief of the <HI>Oneidas,</HI> &s;tood up, and &s;poke as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Hearken to what I am going to &s;ay, in An&s;wer to your Speech to me the Day before Ye|&s;terday. I return you my Thanks; it gives me Plea&s;ure that we &s;ee one another, in the &s;ame Manner as our Forefathers u&s;ed to do.&mdash;Then taking up the Strings delivered by the Governor in their Order, he repeated what had been &s;aid upon them.</P>
<P>We are all very glad to &s;ee you, and your Brethren that are with you, in Health. All die <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and our Nephews, have had interpreted to them all that you &s;aid, and they are plea&s;ed with it, and very glad to &s;ee you, and that it has plea&s;ed the Great GOD, who has all Power in his Hands, to &s;uffer us to come together, to &s;peak to one another freely.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>Then taking another String, he repeated the Governor's Words &s;poke upon it; and, in the Name of all the <HI>Indians</HI> pre&s;ent, returned him Thanks for his taking the Briars out of their Legs, and healing the Brui&s;es that were made in their Feet by the Stones.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The other Day you cleared my Ears, and my Cou&s;ins here, for which I return you Thanks; and now, by this String, I clear your Ears in the &s;ame Manner, thatyou may hear what I have to &s;ay to you.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You told me the other Day, that as we were come from afar, and the Roads were very du&s;ty, you clean&s;ed our Throats from the Du&s;t, and opened a Pa&s;&s;age to our Hearts; we all return you Thanks that you have clean&s;ed us &s;o far, and we do in the &s;ame Manner clean your Throats and Hearts.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You likewi&s;e told me you wiped the Tears from my Eyes, for the Lo&s;s of my Friends, that we may &s;ee one another clearly, for which we all return you our Thanks.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>It is now three Years &s;ince you fir&s;t demanded of us your Fle&s;h and Blood. Now hear me, as to what I and all our Nations and our Allies, that live as far as the Sun-&s;etting, have done.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="009412_0015_0F7404DDD0A5B030">
<HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, in Behalf of all of us pre&s;ent, and the We&s;tern <HI>Indians,</HI> of whom you have been demanding your Fle&s;h and Blood, that I have them here, and that it is not my Fault, neither can I &s;ay our Maker has been the Cau&s;e, but the <HI>French</HI> have been the Cau&s;e why you have not had them &s;ooner.</P>
<P>Then directing his Di&s;cour&s;e to his Brothers and Cou&s;ins, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> he proceeded, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>I never had Occa&s;ion to go to War with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation; the People I had Occa&s;ion to go to War with live to the Southward; it has been &s;o from all Ages, and we have always gone to War again&s;t the Southern <HI>Indians;</HI> I never had Cau&s;e to go to War with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> this was owing to the Evil Spirit, the Devil. When I u&s;ed to go to War with the Southern <HI>Indians,</HI> and brought Pri&s;oners Home, I thought they were mine, and that no Body had any Right to meddle with them. Now &s;ince I joined with you, I went to War again, and I brought <HI>French</HI> People Home with me, as Pri&s;oners, and you took them from me; this makes me think it was owing to the Evil Spirit.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I de&s;ire you to be &s;trong. I have heard you often &s;ay, you would be very glad if I would bring you the Captives, and you would make me Satisfaction, becau&s;e you know I am not as you are; I am of a quite different Nature from you; &s;ometimes I think you are not in Earne&s;t with me, in telling me you will make me Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have heard you, and &s;o have all my Brothers and Cou&s;ins to the We&s;tward heard what you have &s;aid about giving us Satisfaction; your Words &s;eem to be very &s;weet to us. You told us if we did &s;o and &s;o, you would do &s;o with us.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You know we are different Nations, and have different Ways. We could not immediately perform what you required of us, in returning your Fle&s;h and Blood, becau&s;e every one of the&s;e Nations have different Ways; that is the Rea&s;on why we could not &s;o &s;oon perform it.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;orry it is &s;o difficult for us to under&s;tand each other: If we could under&s;tand one another, we would put one another in Mind of the Friend&s;hip that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us and our Forefathers; but as we do not ea&s;ily under&s;tand one another, we are obliged to deliver you the Sub&s;tance in &s;hort of what we have to &s;ay, which makes it tedious.&mdash;(Meaning that they are obliged to interpret in two or three Languages, before it is told to us.)</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You have often told me, if I would bring your Fle&s;h and Blood you would be very glad, and would give &s;uch Pri&s;oners Liberty to return with them, if they did not incline to &s;tay with you, and to go where they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas King</HI> being a&s;ked, who it was that promi&s;ed the Pri&s;oners &s;hould be left to their Choice, to return with them, or to go where they plea&s;ed? He an&s;wered, the Governor pro|mi&s;ed it at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> and there were two Governors there at that Time.&mdash;(Meaning Gover|nor <HI>Denny,</HI> and Governor <HI>Bernard,</HI> of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey.</HI>)</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>You have been requiring your Fle&s;h and Blood the&s;e three Years; I promi&s;e you I will give you them, and now I will deliver all I have brought.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I am &s;orry we cannot &s;peak to one another any fa&s;ter, becau&s;e we cannot under&s;tand one another without &s;o many Interpreters, and this takes up much Time, &s;o that we mu&s;t be &s;low in telling our Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>You have told us, of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> that we mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t you to &s;ee your Fle&s;h and Blood. If we a&s;&s;i&s;t you, you &s;ay you &s;hall &s;ee your Fle&s;h and Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have done what we can, and that is the Rea&s;on why you &s;ee &s;o many of your Fle&s;h and Blood; &s;ome <HI>Indians</HI> part with them with Reluctance, and want to keep them longer;
<PB N="17" REF="009412_0016_0F7404DE8671F6A0" MS="y">they are unwilling to part with them, this brings a great deal of Trouble on us, the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>You have often told us, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> that we &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t in getting your Fle&s;h and Blood. I have done my Endeavour, and taken great Pains: I have got a great many of them, though at fir&s;t with great Diffently: When I brought them by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forts, they took them away from me; all along from <HI>O&s;wego</HI> to the Carrying Place, and &s;o to <HI>Niagara,</HI> till I got to <HI>Shamokin,</HI> they got them all from me, and I believe they have made Servants of them; This is the Rea&s;on why I brought &s;o few of them: No Wonder they are &s;o loath to come, when you make Servants of them. You know that you have told me that I &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t you, you cannot deny it: By and by you will &s;ay, I never told you to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, and that I tell Lies when I &s;ay &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>You told me you would be very glad if I would bring you your Fle&s;h and Blood, and that you were able to make me Satisfaction for them: You &s;aid you had Rooms full of Goods, and that we &s;hould never want any Thing while you have Goods: You told me, we &s;hall have a Recompence for our Trouble in bringing them down. I a&s;&s;ure you, I have brought all your Fle&s;h and Blood that I could get at this Time; there are &s;ome behind yet, but they belong to &s;uch People as are gone to War again&s;t the <HI>Cherokees,</HI> and we could not take them without their Leave, and when they return from War, we will certainly bring them.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I have brought Fourteen of your Fle&s;h and Blood, that is all I could get this Time; for as I told you, your People in the Forts have got them all away from me, they have &s;tole them, or per&s;uaded them to run away from me, and have hid them in the Bu&s;hes. As I told you, there are few left that belong to tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> that are gone to War again&s;t the <HI>Cherokees,</HI> with whom we have been at War from all Ages, and they are at War with you; I a&s;&s;ure you when they return, we will bring them all to you. You u&s;ed to tell me, I always came una|wares upon you, when I did come; you certainly knew that I was coming ever &s;ince la&s;t Spring, and you might have got every Thing ready for me. There is one Captive at the Camp that &s;ays he will not come, he &s;ays the Governor has &s;een him, and talked with him at the Camp; all the re&s;t are here.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>It may be there are two Governors of you; your Me&s;&s;ages and your Words do not agree together; when I repeat what you have &s;aid to me, it &s;eems di&s;agreeable to you.</P>
<P>Here the Governor a&s;ked what he meant by two Governors, and de&s;ired him to explain him&s;elf, for he could not under&s;tand him.</P>
<P><HI>He an&s;wered,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You want to know what my Meaning is, by &s;aying there are two Governors. In every Country there is always one Head Governor, but here are two Governors. It will not do for me to point out People, for you mu&s;t certainly know there is more than one Governor. I hear one &s;ay &s;uch a Thing, and another &s;ay &s;uch a Thing; but I will not point out any Body, le&s;t you &s;hould differ. You will hear of it hereafter. I heard that both Governors came from <HI>Phi|ladelphia,</HI> but perhaps I may be mi&s;informed.</P>
<P>The Governor de&s;ired to know, whether any Me&s;&s;ages had been delivered to them in their own Country, and by whom, and what the Me&s;&s;ages were. He in&s;i&s;ted on their giving him a plain An&s;wer.</P>
<P>They an&s;wered, that the <HI>Cayugas,</HI> who were at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> in the Spring, brought the Me&s;&s;ages to them; but do not pretend that they were delivered in the Governor's Name, but they might have brought what pa&s;&s;ed only in private Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>As I have now brought your Fle&s;h and Blood, I would have you to take Care of them, and keep them fa&s;t. I brought a Girl to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and &s;the run away: When I came Home, I found her there. Bless me! &s;ays I, there in my Wife. I was &s;orry that I had delivered her, but to my Surpries I found her at Home. You know it is hard to part with a Wife.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have brought an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oner, who I love as my own Wife: I have a young Child by her. You know it is very hard for a Man to part with his Wife. I have delivered her, therefore take Care of her, and keep her &s;afe, that &s;he dont make her E&s;cape.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="009412_0017_0F7404DEB6BC5440">
<HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Our Grandfathers u&s;ed to tell us, we &s;hould keep fa&s;t Hold of the Chain of Friend&s;hip, and always advi&s;ed us to ob&s;erve it; but now, in latter Days, as &s;oon as I came acro&s;s the Hatchet, I got Hold of it, and really I did not know what I was about, and &s;tuck it into your Heads. By this Belt, I take the Hatchet out of your Head; it belongs to you and the <HI>French;</HI> you are both of one Colour. It has been the Fault of the <HI>French</HI> that we &s;truck you, and therefore we take the Hatchet out of your Head.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Now that I have taken the Hatchet out of your Head, I gather your Bones, which lie &s;eattered in &s;o many Places, that I cannot name them particularly.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>There is a large Pine Tree in the <HI>Oneida</HI> Country, which I take and pull up by the Roots, and then it makes a great Hole; when I look down the Hole, I &s;ee a great River, running very &s;trong at the Bottom. By this Belt I gather all your Bones, wherever I can find them, and bury them in that Hole, and the Hatchet with them; when I put them down the Hole, they fall into that &s;trong Stream, and float down it, I know not where. I &s;tick that Pine Tree down again in the &s;ame Hole, and then no Body can di&s;cover that there has been a Hole; &s;o that neither you nor I, nor our nor your Grandchildren, &s;hall ever be able to know where your Bones are laid. This is the Cu&s;tom of our Forefathers, that when any Difference aro&s;e between them and their Brethren, they buried it in this Manner.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I own you are my elde&s;t Brother. The elde&s;t Brother &s;hould always teach the younge&s;t Brother, when they mi&s;behave; I therefore de&s;ire when you &s;ee us mi&s;behave, that you would tell us of it, and teach us better.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Seven Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Our late Differences have been the Cau&s;e why the Clouds have hung over our Heads, and made it dark. Now by this Belt I take away all the Clouds, that we may &s;ee the Sky clear, and the Sun ri&s;e and &s;et. We Fourteen Nations, now pre&s;ent, tell you this.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Six Rows,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I don't doubt but there is &s;ome Foulne&s;s come into your Heart, through your Throat. My Grandfathers u&s;ed to tell me, that whenever we found our Brother's Heart and Throat to be foul, that they had left me the be&s;t Medicines, and de&s;ired me to put it to your Mouth, to drink as a Phy&s;ic, and that it would clean&s;e their Throat and Heart, and pa&s;s quite through their Body down to the Ground; and, Brethren, by this String I bury it in the Ground, &s;o that your Heart and Throat may be for ever clean. We Fourteen Nations tell you &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I have removed all the Filthine&s;s from your Body, and &s;ince I have clean&s;ed it out and in, I &s;hall go about that good Work of Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>It was we of the <HI>Mohocks, Oneidas, Senecas, Onondagoes, Cayugas,</HI> and <HI>Tu&s;cararas,</HI> that fir&s;t brought about the good Work of Peace.&mdash;He added, that the <HI>Mohocks</HI> and <HI>Oneidas</HI> were the elde&s;t of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and both of a Height.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I will acquaint you further, that I have more Brothers to the We&s;tward, and that we are all Brothers down as far as to the Sun-&s;et; my Friends are &s;o many, that I cannot tell hove many they are.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I will let you know, that though the <HI>Mohocks</HI> are the elde&s;t, yet they are the furthe&s;t off to the Ea&s;tward: When they hear any Thing, they pa&s;s through the <HI>Oneidas</HI> to the <HI>Onondagoes,</HI> where the Council Fire burns: Likewi&s;e, when the <HI>Senecas</HI> hear any Thing, they come to the <HI>Cayugas,</HI> becau&s;e they are next to the <HI>Onondagoe</HI> Council; &s;o that whenever they hear any Thing to the Ea&s;t or We&s;t, it is carried to the <HI>Onondagoe</HI> Council. (Meaning, that when you &s;hall &s;end any Me&s;&s;ages to the <HI>Onondagoe</HI> Council, they mu&s;t be &s;ent either to the <HI>Senecas</HI> or <HI>Mohocks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I will mention our old Friend&s;hip; I will make it new again; I will brighten up our old Chain of Friend&s;hip. Our Grandfathers u&s;ed to tell one another they had one Heart, and
<PB N="19" REF="009412_0018_0F7404E0D8C98CF0" MS="y">here it is; they both had Hold of it: They u&s;ed to tell one another they had one Head, here it is. I tell you the &s;ame; you and we have one Head, and one Heart. We Fourteen Na|tions tell you &s;o.</P>
<P>They delivered a Belt of Nine Rows, repre&s;enting the Figure of two Men in the Middle, with a Heart between them, and Six Diamonds on each Side; one of the Men repre&s;ents the <HI>Indians,</HI> the other the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Now we have renewed our old Friend&s;hip; I am a little afraid your Fire is almo&s;t out, it is not good; now I will take all that bad Fire away, and kindle it again, and make a good Fire of it; I will take good dry Wood, and kindle up the Fire afre&s;h that our Grandfathers have made, and &s;o make the Smoke ri&s;e up &s;o very high, that all di&s;tant Nations &s;hall &s;ee it, and thereby know that there is a Council Fire here. There was a good Fire at <HI>Ea&s;ton;</HI> that was really a good Fire, for when I came to that good <HI>Ea&s;ton</HI> Fire, I could have my Belly full of Victuals, and Plenty of Drink; but now I come here, I have little to eat; I am &s;ure I have no other Drink than dirty Water, which almo&s;t choaks me.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Six Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>What we have hitherto &s;aid, concerning Peace, has been concluded upon by our old Coun&s;ellors. We al&s;o de&s;ired our chief Warriors to be &s;trong, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the old Coun&s;ellors; and de&s;ired, if any Thing &s;hould be wanting in the old Coun&s;ellors, they would a&s;&s;i&s;t them in it, in order that our Friend&s;hip may be la&s;ting; for the Coun&s;ellors can do nothing, unle&s;s the Warriors &s;hould give their Con&s;ent to it. We Fourteen Nations tell you &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt with Seven Rows, with Two Diamonds in it, repre&s;enting the Coun&s;ellors and Warriors, united in Council together.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Our Friend&s;hip &s;eems to go on very kindly. I will tell you one Thing, you are always longing after my Land, from the Ea&s;t to the We&s;t; you &s;eem to be longing after it. Now I de&s;ire you will not covet it any more; you will &s;erve me as you have done our Cou&s;ins, the <HI>Delawares;</HI> you have got all their Land from them; all the Land hereabouts belonged to them once, and you have got it all.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I de&s;ire you to go no further than <HI>Nixhi&s;aqua</HI> (or <HI>Mohenoy</HI>) I de&s;ire you will &s;ettle no higher up, for if you keep pre&s;&s;ing on me, you will pu&s;h me out, for I &s;hall have no Place to live on, nor hunt in, neither for me nor my Grandchildren; &s;o I de&s;ire you will pre&s;s no further. I de&s;ire another Thing, that you will not take it from me by Force: If you take this Land by Force, it will never go well with either of us. You may remember that GOD gave us this Land, and you &s;ome other; yet I have parted with &s;ome of it to you.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Six Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>You have de&s;ired me to a&s;&s;i&s;t you, in order to bring in your Fle&s;h and Blood, which now you &s;ee I have done. You u&s;ed to tell me, if I would bring in your Fle&s;h and Blood, or a&s;&s;i&s;t you therein, you would &s;atisfy tho&s;e who brought them in the&s;e are mighty plea&s;ing Words to me, and I hope you will do &s;o. Some of our Warriors who are here have no Guns, and if you will be&s;tow any on them, I de&s;ire they may be good. You are daily making Ri&s;les; I do not know what you do with them. When you gave me any Guns, you gave me yellow-|&s;tocked ones, that are worth nothing. I have a&s;ked you now four Times. At <HI>Ea&s;ton</HI> you gave me only Gun-Locks: What think you could I do with them, without Stocks and Bar|rels? I make no Guns. After I got the Gun-Locks, I joined my&s;elf with General <HI>Forbes,</HI> and went to War with him, as you ordered me, again&s;t the <HI>French;</HI> and as &s;oon as I had done it, you &s;till gave me only Gun-locks.</P>
<P><HI>A Bunch of Ten Strings, mo&s;tly black.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed what I had to &s;ay to you, I am now going to &s;peak to my Cou&s;ins. Plea&s;e to hearken to what I &s;hall &s;ay to them.</P>
<P>Then directing his Di&s;cour&s;e to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> he &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>My Cou&s;ins,</HI></P>
<P>I could hardly get along. I heard &s;uch frightful News, that indeed I could not get along, if I had not had good Courage. <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> before I &s;at off from Home, I heard you &s;hould &s;ay, you would poi&s;on us all, &s;o that we &s;hould not hold this Treaty. Thinks I to my&s;elf, I will come neverthele&s;s; if I die, it will be well; I can die but once; &s;o then I came along as far as <HI>Wyoming.</HI></P>
<P>My Cou&s;ins,</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I came there, <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> began to make his Complaints that he had no Fire, &s;o &s;ays I, Cou&s;in, there is certainly &s;ome Fire, for I made one here for the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="009412_0019_0F7404E188A10F88"><HI>(Cacawa&s;heca)</HI> and I made another Fire at <HI>Shamokin,</HI> for <HI>Alammapis;</HI> another Fire I made at <HI>Wighalou&s;in;</HI> another Fire I made at <HI>Diahoga.</HI> All tho&s;e Fires are there yet. The Fire at <HI>Wighalou&s;in</HI> is a good Fire, for I heard no bad Stories there; that Fire at <HI>Shamokin</HI> is not yet out; if any Body &s;tirs it, it will &s;oon blaze. I made the Fire at <HI>Wyoming</HI> for the <HI>Shawane&s;e;</HI> perhaps they will &s;till return to that Place. Then I came along as far as <HI>Harris</HI>'s Ferry; there I heard another Piece of bad News from <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> who &s;aid he had got a Sort of Poi&s;on that will give the <HI>Indians</HI> the Bloody Flux, and as &s;oon as they come, he would give it to them, that they might get the Flux, and die along the Road as they go. But, notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e Di&s;couragements, I came along, and got here. I now &s;u&s;pect there is a Bag of Poi&s;on &s;omewhere about this Camp, that will give us the Flux as we go Home; and I think it will be great Shame, if it &s;hould be &s;o, becau&s;e our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Brethren &s;ent for us; and if any of us &s;hould die, it will appear to them as if they had lo&s;t &s;o many of their own People, becau&s;e it was they that &s;ent for us.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> I mu&s;t teach you better; I will correct you; you mu&s;t not talk of &s;uch a Thing, for if any of us die, it will be &s;aid <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> was the Cau&s;e of it; &s;o you &s;hould not &s;ay &s;uch Things. By this Belt I make a Fire for <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> at <HI>Wyoming;</HI> I tell him to &s;it there by the Fire Side, and watch that Fire; but I dont give it to him, for our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Brethren ca&s;t an Eye upon that Land; therefore I &s;ay to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> watch that Fire, and if any White People come there, tell them to go away, for that Land belongs to your Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations.</HI> The <HI>Six Nations</HI> want to keep up that Fire, that they may hear from their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>The Belt was given to <HI>Tipi&s;cohan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then turning to the Governor, be &s;aid,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>This is all I have to &s;ay at pre&s;ent, but I have more in my Heart, which I cannot &s;peak now, having &s;taid &s;o long that I am quite fatigued.</P>
<P>The Governor then acquainted <HI>Thomas King,</HI> that he had been attentive to all he &s;aid, and that he thanked him for it, and when he had con&s;idered of it, would at a proper Time re|turn him an An&s;wer; but told him, that he had not yet delivered him the Pri&s;oners, and as this was in improper Place, he de&s;ired a few <HI>Indians</HI> would take them to the Court-Hou&s;e, where he would receive them.</P>
<P>The Conference then broke up, and the Governor, his Council, and the Commi&s;&s;ioners, went with &s;ome <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs to the Court-Hou&s;e, to receive the Pri&s;oners; where being come, the Governor acquainted <HI>Thomas King,</HI> that he was now ready to receive the Pri&s;oners from him, and that they need not be under any Apprehen&s;ions of being u&s;ed ill, for that he would be kind to them, and treat them like Children, and re&s;tore them to their Parents and Relations.</P>
<P><HI>Then they delivered to the Governor the Pri&s;oners, as follow.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Elizabeth Williams,</HI> a young Woman, delivered by <HI>Mu&s;&s;au&s;e,</HI> a <HI>Mun&s;ey Indian; Henry Williams,</HI> about Eighteen Years of Age, Brother to <HI>Elizabeth Williams,</HI> delivered by <HI>Conoy|hocheratoquin,</HI> a <HI>Mun&s;ey; Peggy Dougherty,</HI> delivered by <HI>Eckgoh&s;on,</HI> a <HI>Mun&s;ey; Mary Tidd,</HI> and her Child, taken near <HI>Samuel Depui</HI>'s, by <HI>Eckgoh&s;on; Abigail Evan,</HI> and her Child, ta|ken at <HI>Stony-Creek,</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> by <HI>Cowach&s;ora,</HI> a <HI>Seneca.</HI></P>

</LIST></P>
<P>THE Governor opened the Conference, and &s;poke to the <HI>Indians</HI> as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Beaver,</P>
<P>I told you, a few Days &s;ince, of the Di&s;putes that had happened between your Brothers, the Proprietaries, and <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> about Land; and that I had their Orders, as &s;oon as that Di&s;pute &s;hould be ended, and the Proprietaries Characters cleared, to make the <HI>Delaware Indians</HI> a Pre&s;ent of con&s;iderable Value, as a Mark of their Affection to their old Friends. To which Pre&s;ent from the Proprietaries, the good People of this Province have been plea&s;ed to make an Addition, of equal Value.</P>
<P><HI>Brothers,</HI> Teedyu&s;cung <HI>and</HI> Beaver,</P>
<P>As that Di&s;pute is now happily &s;ettled, I do (in Con&s;equence of the Proprietaries Orders, and upon what was agreed upon at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> upon that Subject, between me and your Friends, the People of this Province) make you a Pre&s;ent of the Goods and Money now lying before you, to be equally divided between you, as a Proof of the Regard, both of the Proprietaries and People, for their old Friends, the <HI>Delaware</HI> Nation.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Beaver,</P>
<P>As this is the fir&s;t Time we have &s;een you, and our Friends from the We&s;tward, &s;ince the late Di&s;turbances; and as &s;ome of them have been at Expence in collecting and bringing down our Fle&s;h and Blood, which they have now delivered to us, I, and your Friends of this Province, have thought fit to make you this further Pre&s;ent, to te&s;tify the Plea&s;ure we have in &s;eeing you, after &s;o long an Ab&s;ence, and our Thankfulne&s;s for your having re&s;tored the Pri&s;oners.&mdash;As you know better than we, in what Manner to divide the Pre&s;ent now made you, we de&s;ire you will do it among&s;t tho&s;e who come with you, in the mo&s;t ju&s;t and equitable Manner, paying a particular Regard to tho&s;e who have now, or at any other Time, been at Trouble and Expence in collecting and re&s;toring our Fle&s;h and Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyu&s;cung,</P>
<P>We have had frequent Opportunities of &s;haking you by the Hand, &s;ince the War, and you, upon many Occa&s;ions, received the &s;tronge&s;t Proofs of our Reconciliation and Friend&s;hip for you. Neverthele&s;s, as we ob&s;erve that a greater Number than common of your Friends are come down with you, in order to enable you to &s;hew your Kindne&s;s to them, we think fit to make you this additional Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>And now, Brothers, I heartily wi&s;h the Peace and Friend&s;hip, which have been renewed betwixt us at this Treaty, may continue and grow &s;tronger, as long as the Sun &s;hall &s;hine, or the Rivers run; to which you may be a&s;&s;ured we, on our Parts, &s;hall contribute to the utmo&s;t of our Power, as we doubt not you will al&s;o on yours.</P>
<P>After the Governor had fini&s;hed his Speeches to <HI>Beaver</HI> and <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> the latter ro&s;e up, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>Beaver,</HI> de&s;ired him to take Notice, that he now delivered up all his Right and Claim to the Lands on the River <HI>Delaware,</HI> that have been in Di&s;pute between him and the Proprietaries of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> and that he now, as he <HI>(Beaver)</HI> &s;aw, received
<PB N="22" REF="009412_0021_0F7404E279038520">this Money and Goods from his Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> He further de&s;ired <HI>Beaver</HI> to acquaint all the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> that the <HI>Delaware</HI> Nation have now no Right or Claim to any of the Lands on the Waters of the River <HI>Delaware,</HI> that have been in Di&s;pute.</P>
<P><HI>Then turning to the Governor, &s;aid to him,</HI></P>
<P>Now Brother Governor, our Children and Grandchildren &s;hall never be able to &s;ay here|after, that they have any Right or Claim to the Lands that have been in Di&s;pute upon that River.</P>
<P>The Governor, directing his Di&s;cour&s;e to <HI>Beaver</HI> and <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> told them, that as they had now received a con&s;iderable Sum of Money, he cautioned them again&s;t giving too much of it to their young Men, who, in&s;tead of laying it out in Things nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful, might be tempted to debauch them&s;elves with &s;trong Liquors, which might occa&s;ion them to quar|rel, and do Mi&s;chief, not only to one another, but al&s;o to their Brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> which might endanger the Chain of Friend&s;hip betwixt them and us, and would be a very ungrate|ful Return for all the Kindne&s;s we had &s;hewn them.</P>
<P><HI>To which they both an&s;wered,</HI></P>
<P>That they were obliged to the Governor for his Advice, in which they thought he had their Good at Heart, and promi&s;ed to follow it, and heartily thanked him for it.</P>
<P>The Governor then delivered to <HI>Beaver</HI> and <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> re&s;pectively, <HI>Two Hundred Pounds,</HI> in milled Dollars, and the Value of <HI>Four Hundred Pounds</HI> in Goods, to be equally divided between them. He further pre&s;ented to <HI>Beaver,</HI> and tho&s;e who came with him from the <HI>Ohio,</HI> the Value of <HI>Four Hundred Pounds</HI> in Goods; and the Value of <HI>Two Hundred Pounds</HI> in Goods to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> and his Friends and People. And after taking them both by the Hand he departed, and the Conference ended.</P>

<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>It is about three Years ago that you a&s;ked me, whether I was willing you &s;hould build a Fort at <HI>Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">nokin;</HI> you &s;aid you wanted to build a Fort there, to &s;tand again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> and to defend the Inhabitants; that our Great King had commanded you to build Forts. You &s;aid you would keep a Fort there as long as the War continued, but that you did not want any of our Land there.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>You likewi&s;e a&s;ked me to let you build a Fort there, to defend my Land, and to defend your&s;elf; you told me, that you did not de&s;ire any greater Quantity of my Land than what the Fort took up. I granted you Liberty to build a Fort, becau&s;e you told me it was the Great King GEORGE de&s;ired you might build one on my Land; and I endeavoured to a&s;&s;i&s;t you. You al&s;o told me, as &s;oon as ever the Peace was concluded you would go away; or that at any Time when I &s;hould tell you to go away, you would go away, and that I might do what I would with the Fort.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>Now all the different Tribes of us pre&s;ent, de&s;ire that you will call your Soldiers away from <HI>Shamokin;</HI> for we have concluded a Peace, and are as one Brother, having one Head and one Heart.</P>
<P>If you take away your Soldiers, we de&s;ire you would keep your Trading Hou&s;e there, and have &s;ome hone&s;t Man in it, becau&s;e our Cou&s;ins follow their Hunting there, and will want a Trade. This is the Way for us to live peaceably together.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I mu&s;t tell you again, the&s;e Soldiers mu&s;t go away from <HI>Shamokin</HI> Fort; I de&s;ire it, and let there be only Traders live there; you know who are the hone&s;t People; we de&s;ire that
<PB N="23" REF="009412_0022_0F7404E882E64388" MS="y">only hone&s;t People may live there, and that you will not be too hard with us, when they may buy our Skins and Furs, and &s;uch Things as we may have to &s;ell. This will be the Way for us to live peaceably together; but for you to keep Soldiers there, is not the Way to live peaceable. Your Soldiers are very often unruly, and our Warriors are unruly, and when &s;uch get together they do not agree. For as you have now made Peace with all our Nations, there is no Occa&s;ion for Soldiers to live there any longer.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> have all con&s;ulted, and concluded on this Matter of your removing the Soldiers from <HI>Shamokin;</HI> for you know we go to War with the Southern <HI>Indians,</HI> the <HI>Cherokees;</HI> we have been at War with them ever &s;ince we were created, and the Place where the <HI>Shamokin</HI> Fort &s;tands is right in our Warriors Path, and you know that Warriors are al|ways an unruly People. For this Rea&s;on we de&s;ire you to take away your Soldiers, and place &s;ome hone&s;t Man there, that he may &s;upply our Warriors with Ammunition, and any other Nece&s;&s;aries that they may want, when they go to War again&s;t the <HI>Cherokees.</HI> We mu&s;t pre&s;s you to take away your Soldiers from <HI>Shamokin,</HI> as our Warriors are unruly. You have planted Corn there, and if our Warriors come there, they may cut &s;ome of your Corn-&s;talks, and then you will be angry. The Fort you have there does not now do any Good, for you have many other Forts all around you; this one therefore can be of no U&s;e to you; it &s;tands as it were at your own Doors.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Twelve Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> He &s;aid he had forgot a Word in this Belt, which was to tell the Governor, that he might chu&s;e and appoint &s;uch Men as plea&s;ed to trade, and al&s;o a Black-&s;mith and Gun-&s;mith, to mend their Guns and Hatchets, or do any Thing they may want.</P>
<P><HI>He then added,</HI></P>
<P>We de&s;ire that the pre&s;ent Store-keepers at <HI>Shamokin</HI> may be removed, and hone&s;t Men placed there in their Room; for our Hunters, who have been down there, complain that when <HI>Indians</HI> come there, and want Provi&s;ions and Goods, they find the Store &s;ometimes &s;hut up, and they cannot be &s;upplied with what they want.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>For my Part, I think <HI>John Harris</HI> is the mo&s;t &s;uitable Man to keep Store; for he lives right in the Road where our Warriors pa&s;s, and he is very well known by all of us in our Nation; as his Father was before him; we all know him. If you chu&s;e <HI>John Harris,</HI> we de&s;ire you will order him to keep Provi&s;ions and Cloaths, to give to our People, who &s;ome|times come there naked; and likewi&s;e Ammunition for our Warriors, for that is their Path. We de&s;ire you may have no Trading Hou&s;es higher up the <HI>Sa&s;quehannah</HI> than <HI>Shamokin;</HI> let the <HI>Indians</HI> come there, or to <HI>John Harris</HI>'s; if they want to trade, let them come down to the&s;e Trading Hou&s;es. We al&s;o de&s;ire you will &s;end your Me&s;&s;ages to <HI>John Harris</HI>'s, &s;o that we may hear from one another, becau&s;e where he lives the Road &s;eems to divide, and &s;pread, and it goes to many Places. And we further de&s;ire you will give him a Commi&s;&s;ion for the&s;e Things, in Writing.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas King</HI> being a&s;ked, if they meant that <HI>John Harris</HI> was to be furni&s;hed with Goods to &s;ell or to give to the <HI>Indians?</HI> He an&s;wered, that they de&s;ired there might be a Trading Hou&s;e there, and that this was what they reque&s;ted; and de&s;iring to be excu&s;ed, if they for|got any Part of their Speeches, as they were very long.</P>
<P><HI>He proceeded.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I have now mentioned two Places for you to keep Store Hou&s;es at, <HI>Shamokin</HI> and <HI>John Harris</HI>'s; but perhaps they will &s;ell at different Prices, and if we have a Mind to have Goods cheape&s;t, we may go to <HI>John Harris</HI>'s. We therefore de&s;ire you will let us know, what Prices you &s;et upon your Goods.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Ten Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I will al&s;o acquaint you of another proper Trading Place, and who we think will be a &s;uit|able Man to keep that Store Hou&s;e, and that is <HI>George Croghan,</HI> who is very well known by all our Nations, and &s;everal others. We de&s;ire you will appoint him to keep Store at <HI>Bed|ford,</HI> becau&s;e that is al&s;o in our Warriors Path. We de&s;ire likewi&s;e, that there may be a Black-&s;mith and Gun-&s;mith, becau&s;e my Cou&s;ins will be there a hunting, and will want their Things mended. This will be known every where, throughout all our Nations; for as the Peace is made, our young Men will &s;et them&s;elves to hunt, and bring Skins there, and will have nothing el&s;e to do but hunt.</P>

<HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I will al&s;o acquaint you of another Trading Place, which is the Place they call <HI>Patowmack,</HI> in <HI>Maryland.</HI> One <HI>Dantel Cre&s;&s;ap</HI> has &s;ent me Word, by many Warriors, this Spring, and he tells me, that if the Governor would order him to keep a Store there, he would provide every Thing for the Warriors; for his Father u&s;ed-to maintain all the <HI>Indian</HI> Warriors that pa&s;&s;ed and re-pa&s;&s;ed that Way. He likewi&s;e tells me, if the Governor would let him know what he thould do, and if he &s;hould be allowed to do this, he would provide for the War|riors. We now de&s;ire, that he may be the Per&s;on appointed to receive Me&s;&s;ages, and that you would acquaint the Governor of <HI>Maryland</HI> with this, that the Warriors may pa&s;s and re|pa&s;s that Way, without any Mole&s;tation.</P>

<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We de&s;ire you to acquaint the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> that we may pa&s;s and re-pa&s;s through his Province, when we go to War with the <HI>Cherokees;</HI> for our Warriors Road is &s;topped up in many Places; <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> People have &s;ettled on it. And now we de&s;ire that a Road may be opened, that we may pa&s;s &s;afely. We de&s;ire nothing but Love and Friend&s;hip with our Brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as we pa&s;s through. We de&s;ire you will &s;end a Letter, with this Belt, to the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> as from us, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; for I do not know how &s;oon my People may go that Way; our Warriors have already the Hatchet in their Hands, and perhaps they may go there before your Letter gets there; for which Rea&s;on I de&s;ire you will make Ha&s;te in this Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Five Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We now de&s;ire you to be &s;trong, and that you will give us Powder; I do not think that you will refu&s;e to let me have Powder, for you are able. Our Brother, General <HI>John&s;on,</HI> though but a &s;ingle Man, &s;upplies all our People with Powder; when we go to &s;ee him, he fills all our Powder-horns with it. I &s;ee a great many of you here, and I think you are more able than he. Our own People at Home will have their Eye upon us, and expect that we &s;hall bring them &s;ome Powder, and Pre&s;ents; we therefore hope you will con&s;ider us in this, and make them larger than common, as we do not come to &s;ee you often.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of Nine Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I now &s;peak in Behalf of our Warriors. When we heard your Words come to our Coun|tries, they were very plea&s;ing to us, that you would make Pre&s;ents to your Brethren, when they come to &s;ee you, and would give them any Thing they might went. Now we de&s;ire you will give us &s;ome Vermilion, for you know that the elde&s;t Brother has always Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion on the younge&s;t Brother; we know you are able, as you make all the&s;e Things in your&s;elves. We have all concluded Peace now, but we have given our young Men Liberty to go to War with the Southern <HI>Indians;</HI> this is the Rea&s;on of our wanting the red Paint; you &s;ee the Warriors always paint them&s;elves, when they go to War.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I &s;hall now &s;peak a few Words, without any Belt or String. Whenever the <HI>French</HI> were a&s;ked for Paint, or any Thing el&s;e, they always gave it to the <HI>Indians</HI> readily; and it is no Wonder that &s;o many <HI>Indians</HI> liked the <HI>French,</HI> &s;ince they were &s;o kind to them.</P>
<P>You &s;ee &s;everal of our <HI>Indians</HI> here dre&s;&s;ed in <HI>French</HI> Cloaths; and we de&s;ire the Governor will be &s;trong, and &s;upply us with every Thing.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I have not le&s;t any Thing in my Heart; I have &s;aid every Thing material I had to &s;ay; and now I de&s;ire you will help me as far as <HI>Shamokin,</HI> and &s;upply me with Provi&s;ions; for perhaps &s;ome of our People, if they are hungry, may hurt &s;ome of the Inhabitants Corn or Fruit, and cau&s;e Differences to ari&s;e.

<P>We all de&s;ire you to remember our Son, <HI>Robert White,</HI> who carries all our Me&s;&s;ages; he is old, and we de&s;ire you will give him a Hor&s;e; you did give him a Mare before, but &s;he is dead; &s;he was with Foal, and died.</P>

<P><HI>THOMAS KING,</HI> in Behalf of the Chiefs of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> waited on the Gover|nor, and acquainted him, that as their Speeches to him of Ye&s;terday were long, he &s;u&s;pected he might have forgot &s;omething, and de&s;ired he would give him the Opportunity of hearing every Thing he had &s;aid repeated to them.</P>
<P>On which the Governor appointed a Meeting at the old <HI>Lutheran</HI> Church, at which were</P>
<P>PRESENT,

<ITEM><HI>The Honourable</HI> JAMES HAMILTON, <HI>E&s;quire,</HI> GOVERNOR, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>WILLIAM LOGAN, RICHARD PETERS, <HI>E&s;quires, of the Council;</HI></ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Indians</HI> were &s;eated, the Governor, laying the &s;everal Belts and Strings in their Order, as delivered him Ye&s;terday, directed the Secretary to read the Minutes, which were di&s;tinctly interpreted to them, Paragraph by Paragraph, and declared by the <HI>Indians</HI> to be right.</P>
<P><HI>After which</HI> Thomas King <HI>aro&s;e, and &s;poke as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>I mi&s;took when I told you Ye&s;terday, that I would have you keep a Store at <HI>Bedford;</HI> I meant that Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> &s;hould have a Store there, and that you &s;hould have the Care of the Stores at <HI>Shamokin,</HI> and <HI>John Harris</HI>'s. As <HI>George Croghan</HI> is under Sir <HI>William John|&s;on,</HI> I wanted that he &s;hould appoint Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> to keep the Store at <HI>Bedford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> Tokahaion, <HI>a</HI> Cayuga <HI>Chief, &s;poke to the Governor as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>My Cou&s;ins, that live at <HI>Wighalou&s;in,</HI> tell me, they went to the <HI>Ea&s;ton</HI> Treaty to hear &s;ome|thing about the Land Affair, between the Governor and <HI>Teedyu&s;cung;</HI> the&s;e, my Cou&s;ins, went to the Governor, to enquire about their own Lands. The Governor made An&s;wer to them, and told them, that he had bought their Land from their Uncles.&mdash;What they wanted to know about their Land is this, that if they found it was not &s;old by the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> they
<PB N="26" REF="009412_0025_0F7404E50645D1D8">think they ought to be paid for it. And &s;ince my Cou&s;ins made this Complaint to the Governor, at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> they have a&s;ked me, whether I had &s;old the Land, or not. And I told them, that I did not know that I had &s;old any Lands belonging to my Cou&s;ins; but (&s;peaking to the Governor) &s;aid, you know it, becau&s;e you have Writings.</P>
<P><HI>He further added,</HI></P>
<P>You can tell whether you have bought the Land, or not; if it is not &s;old to you by the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> it &s;till belongs to them; but I do not want to &s;ell Land, that you have already bought.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> having fini&s;hed what they had to &s;ay, the Governor acquainted them, that <HI>Thomas</HI> King had promi&s;ed him, the other Day, that they would deliver up all the Pri&s;oners that were in their Camp, and that he under&s;tood &s;ome were there yet, and de&s;ired to know the Rea&s;on of their not being delivered up.</P>
<P>Thomas King <HI>An&s;wered,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I acknowledge to have &s;aid, I would deliver up all the Pri&s;oners, and I thought it had been done, and that all were delivered up that remained in the Camp; but we have gone too far, in engaging to deliver up all the Pri&s;oners in the <HI>Indian</HI> Country, that belong to the ab&s;ent Warriors. However, we &s;uppo&s;e they will be delivered up, and we will do our Endeavours that it &s;hall be &s;o, and will con&s;ult with tho&s;e that have the Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> Kinderuntie, <HI>the</HI> Seneca <HI>Warrior, &s;poke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>There are yet two White Men in the Camp; one of them, though he came with us, yet it was not by our Con&s;ent; he would follow us; he belongs to a Warrior, that is gone to War again&s;t the <HI>Cherokees,</HI> and we had no Right to bring him, without the Warrior's Con|&s;ent; you &s;ee him every Day; he is at Liberty. The other is a De&s;erter; he came among us of his own Accord; we informed Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> of it, and Sir <HI>William</HI> &s;aid, that perhaps he might have mi&s;behaved, and that we might keep him; perhaps he might learn the Language, and be of Service as an Interpreter, and that he might &s;tay with us, if he would; he did not come to us as a Pri&s;oner, and as he has his Liberty, you may talk with him, if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor made An&s;wer,</HI></P>
<P>That as to the Captive, he expected they would deliver him up; and de&s;ired that they would bring the De&s;erter to him To-morrow Morning, that he might &s;peak with him.</P>
<P><HI>To which</HI> Kinderuntie <HI>replied,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I cannot deliver up the Captive to you; he does not belong to me; he belongs, as I told you, to tho&s;e that are gone to War; he came here of his own Accord; he followed me down, and if I &s;hould deliver him now, the Warriors would &s;ay that I had &s;old him, and that will make me a&s;hamed; I therefore de&s;ire my Brother will not force me to deliver him at this Time, to make me a&s;hamed. As to the De&s;erter, I will bring him to you at any Time.</P>
<P>The Governor concluded, by &s;aying to them, that he would have them con&s;ider of this Matter in their Council again, and reflect &s;eriou&s;ly upon it, as he &s;hould have no Dependance on all they had already &s;aid, about re&s;toring the Pri&s;oners; unle&s;s they now delivered up this one to him.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have, according to the antient Cu&s;tom of your Ance&s;tors, upon my bidding you wel|come, and cleaning you, performed the u&s;ual Ceremonies on like Occa&s;ions; with which I am well plea&s;ed, and return you Thanks.</P>
<P><HI>A large String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren, (Holding up the Belts and Strings that they gave)</HI></P>
<P>By the&s;e Belts you have made me &s;everal Speeches, re&s;pecting my reque&s;ting you to u&s;e your Influence with your Nephews, and all other <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, to re&s;tore to us all our Fla&s;h and Blood. I make no Doubt you have met with &s;ome Difficulties on that Head, as I am very well acquainted with the Manner in which you carry on War again&s;t one another, and that what Pri&s;oners you take, you claim an ab&s;olute Property in, by adopting them into your own Nation, as &s;oon as they bring them Home.</P>
<P>But, Brethren, the Ca&s;e is quite different between you and us. We do not look upon you to have the &s;ame Sort of Right over our Fle&s;h and Blood, as over your own. As we are of a different Colour from you, &s;o we have different Cu&s;toms. It is a con&s;tant Rule with us White People, that upon making of a Peace with tho&s;e with whom we have been at War, the Pri&s;oners on both Sides are faithfully delivered up. Be&s;ides, you may remember it was a po|&s;itive Engagement between us, upon re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the antient Chain of Friend&s;hip that tho&s;e Nations who had taken any of our People Pri&s;oners, &s;hould deliver them all up; and this, Brethren, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon, as the only Means of burying every Thing that has pa&s;&s;ed be|tween us. I thank you for the Influence you have u&s;ed, and the Trouble you have taken, upon this Occa&s;ion; but we are informed, by &s;uch as have lately pa&s;&s;ed through the <HI>Indian</HI> Countries, that there yet remain a great many of our People, as Pri&s;oners, in &s;ome of your Towns, particularly among our Brothers, the <HI>Senccas.</HI> It is, I &s;uppo&s;e, as you fay, that &s;ome of them may belong to the Warriors, who are gone to War again&s;t the Southern <HI>In|dians,</HI> with whom you are always at War; but whether they belong to them, or any other People, we expect that you will acquaint them with your repeated Engagements, that they &s;hall all be delivered up, and therefore that they will no longer continue unwilling to part with them.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As to what you &s;ay about our Promi&s;es of paying you for our Fle&s;h and Blood, you mu&s;t have been mi&s;taken; for I never either told you &s;o, or &s;ent you any &s;uch Me&s;&s;age. If you have received any Me&s;&s;ages to that Effect, they mu&s;t have come from &s;ome other People. But I mu&s;t be plain with you on this Subject, and tell you, that it is never our Cu&s;tom to pur|cha&s;e our Fle&s;h and Blood of any Nation what&s;oever. But, Brethren, what I have told you, and what I now again tell you, is this, that for any Services you may have done, with any of the Nations, on that Account, or for any Trouble or Expence they may be at, in bringing them down to me, I will make you and them a &s;uitable Satisfaction.</P>

<P>As to what you &s;ay about making Servants of our Pri&s;oners, we are entirely ignorant of it; we do no &s;uch Thing, but as &s;oon as we receive them from your Hands, we deliver them up to their Parents and Relations, if they happen to be pre&s;ent, and if not, we cloath them, and take Care of them, till we can get an Opportunity of &s;ending them to their Friends. They are our own Fle&s;h and Blood, and we u&s;e them as tenderly as is in our Power; if any have been treated otherwi&s;e, it is owing to your not delivering them to me. We have, indeed, at the In&s;tance of &s;ome of your own People, put the Pri&s;oners into the Court-Hou&s;e, till we could take their Names, and be informed of the Places of their Abode; and as &s;oon as we were told this, they were all cloathed, and forthwith &s;ent along, with &s;ome good Per&s;ons to take Care of them, to their Habitations; therefore do not entertain any Notion that we make Servants or Slaves of them, and when you return Home, let all your Nations know that this is truly the Ca&s;e, and that the Pri&s;oners are at Liberty to go to their Relations, as &s;oon as they are delivered up to us; or, if they have no Relations, they go into &s;uch Places where they can be&s;t get Employment, in order to maintain them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I think it my Duty to tell you, that &s;uch of our White Men who want to &s;tay with you, are either De&s;erters from the Army, or have behaved ill among&s;t us, and were they to &s;tay with
<PB N="28" REF="009412_0027_0F7404E576F0B280" MS="y">you, they would be very apt to be very mi&s;chievous, and make ill Blood between us; we de|&s;ire therefore you will not encourage them, but deliver all &s;uch up as you have among&s;t you; and if you place any Dependance upon them, either in Peace or War, they will certainly de|ceive you, as they have dene us.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It grieves me that any Occa&s;ion &s;hould have been admini&s;tred to you, to ob&s;erve to me, in &s;o public a Manner, that there are others be&s;ides my&s;elf who concern them&s;elves in Affairs of Government. If it be as you &s;ay, I mu&s;t tell you, Brethren, that it is a great Pre&s;ump|tion, and an high Infringement of the Rights of Government, for any Per&s;on what&s;oever, within this Province, except by my &s;pecial Order or Commi&s;&s;ion, to &s;end or deliver Me&s;&s;ages to you, or to any other Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> or to treat with you, or them, on any public Matters. I am the only Per&s;on intru&s;ted by His Maje&s;ty, and the Proprietaries, with the Admini&s;tration of public Affairs within this Province; and I de&s;ire you to take Notice, that in order to prevent any Thing of this Kind for the future, all Me&s;&s;engers I &s;hall &s;end to you &s;hall be furmthed with proper Credentials, and my Speeches in Writing, under the u&s;ual Seal; and if any Per&s;ons, <HI>Indians</HI> or others, &s;hould take upon them to deliver to you any Me&s;&s;ages in my Name, unle&s;s they bring with them &s;uch Credentials as above mentioned, I de&s;ire you will pay no Regard to them, and acquaint me therewith.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You acquaint me, that your Grandfathers advi&s;ed you never so have any Difference with your Brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> It had been well you had con&s;tantly taken their Advice, but as you &s;ay the Evil Spirit got the better of your Under&s;tandings, and compelled you to &s;trike us, you, the other Day, by this Belt of Wampum, took the Hatchet out of my Head. It is po&s;|&s;ible, Brethren, that as you &s;truck us, and obliged us to &s;trike you, that you al&s;o have been hurt by us; I therefore, by this Belt, take the Hatchet out of your Heads.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt I join with you in collecting all our and your Bones, where&s;oever &s;cattered, and in burying them, with the Hatchet, and do heap up Earth about the Roots of the great Tree in the <HI>Oneida</HI> Country, where they and the Hatchet are buried; &s;o that the Smell there|of may never offend us hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt you tell me that I am your elder Brother, and whenever you mi&s;behave, you de&s;ire me to give you Advice. Brethren, my real Regard to your Welfare, as we are Bre|thren, will always induce me to take Notice of any Thing wrong that I &s;hall ob&s;erve in your Conduct; and by this Belt I &s;top your Ears again&s;t hearkening to any but my&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I join with you in di&s;per&s;ing the dark Clouds that have gathered together, during our Dif|ferences, and hid the Light from us, that we may &s;ee the Sky clearly, from Sun-ri&s;ing to Sun-&s;etting.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this String of Wampum you tell me, that &s;ome Foulne&s;s may have got into my Heart, through my Throat, and that with a Medicine, left you by your Fathers, you make it pa&s;s quite through my Body to the Ground, and bury it there. As you may have contracted the like Foulne&s;s, by this String of Wampum I thoroughly purge your Body, and remove every Defilement.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You tell me, by this Belt, that there are only two Doors, the <HI>Mohawks</HI> and <HI>Senecas,</HI> to the <HI>Onondagoe</HI> Council, one to the We&s;tward, the other to the Ea&s;tward, through one of which all the Me&s;&s;ages to that Council &s;hould properly come.</P>
<P>As I under&s;tand, by this Information, that you expect that this Method &s;hould always be ob&s;erved by me, I &s;hall very readily conform to it, and think it a very prudent E&s;tabli&s;hment of yours, for the Di&s;patch and regular Tran&s;action of Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt you take Notice, that our old Council Fire is almo&s;t out, and not good, and that you now put to it the &s;ame good dry Wood, &s;uch as your Ance&s;tors u&s;ed, and make it burn as bright as ever. You add further, that your Entertainment has not been as good here as at <HI>Ea&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="009412_0028_0F7404E7ABD5D128" MS="y">
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I take it kind and friendly in you, that you have kindled up the old Fire; and by this Belt I heap up &s;ome good dry Wood, and join with you in putting it on the Council Fire, that it may burn as bright as ever. I am very &s;orry there &s;hould be any Cau&s;e of Complaint given you here, with Re&s;pect to your Accommodations; I took all the Pains in my Power that there &s;hould be none, and I hope now every Thing is made agreeable to you, with Re&s;pect to your good Accommodation.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt you acquaint me, that your Warriors have a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Coun&s;ellors in making firm the good Work of Peace, and that without their Concurrence and A&s;&s;i&s;tance the Coun|&s;ellors can do nothing effectually.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It gives me Plea&s;ure to hear that your Warriors are united with you in Council, and are become unanimous in e&s;tabli&s;hing the Peace, which has been &s;o happily brought about. I am &s;en&s;ible of their Importance, and hope that the Harmony which now &s;ub&s;i&s;ts may long continue; and I &s;hall be ready to &s;erve them, as well as you, as long as their future Conduct &s;hall merit it.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt you tell me, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have a longing Eye after your Land, and de&s;ire that we may not covet any more of your Land; and &s;ay further, that we have got all the Land belonging to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and &s;hall &s;erve you as we have done them.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It is true the <HI>Delawares</HI> had a large Tract of Land in this Province, bordering on the Ri|ver <HI>Delaware,</HI> which the Proprietaries of this Province have, from Time to Time, fairly pur|cha&s;ed of them, and have hone&s;tly paid them for it, which they have acknowledged, in your Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By the &s;ame Belt you de&s;ire we will not think of making any more Purcha&s;e of Land, or &s;ettling your Lands by Force; for if we do, we &s;hall pu&s;h you back, and leave you no Land to live or hunt upon; and de&s;ire we would confine our&s;elves to <HI>Nixhi&s;aqua,</HI> or <HI>Mohonoy,</HI> and &s;ettle no higher up.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Proprietaries of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> have never forced a Purcha&s;e of Lands from any of their Brethren, the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;ince they have owned this Province. It is very well known, that the Native <HI>Indians</HI> very readily &s;old their Lands to the Proprietaries, as &s;oon as he arrived here in their Country, about Eighty Years ago. And about Thirty Years ago the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> ob&s;erving greater Numbers of White People than tho&s;e old Purcha&s;es could accommodate, voluntarily &s;old to the pre&s;ent Proprietaries &s;ome Lands, lying further We&s;t. And their Number &s;till increa&s;ing, at <HI>Albany,</HI> in the Year 1754, they &s;old them more Lands, as far as the Limits of the Province to the We&s;t, to be bounded by a Line agreed upon to the North|ward.</P>
<P>And let me remind you of their Kindne&s;s to you, in this Re&s;pect; for no &s;ooner were they informed that you repented of this la&s;t Sale, than they immediately gave Orders to their Agents here, to execute a Relea&s;e to you for all the Lands over the <HI>Allegheny Hills,</HI> which was accordingly done at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> in the Year 1758, in public Council; when a Draught of the Part of the Country, which the Proprietaries held, by the <HI>Six Nations</HI> Deed, on this Side the <HI>Allegheny Hills,</HI> was &s;hewn to, and approved by, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> &s;ome of whom are now pre&s;ent; and the Draught, and Copy of the Proprietary Relea&s;e, were delivered in open Council to them, who returned their hearty Thanks to the Proprietaries for their Goodne&s;s. I hear tho&s;e Chiefs put the Relea&s;e and Draught into Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI>'s Hands, and de&s;ired him to keep it for them, together with many other Deeds and Papers, at the &s;ame Time. Now, Brethren, as no Time has been fixed for the running of the North Line, or Boundary of this la&s;t Purcha&s;e, I de&s;ire you to apply to Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> and whenever you and he &s;hall think it nece&s;&s;ary to run that Line, I &s;hall always be ready to join with you; and until this be done, agreeable to your Deed, I &s;hall not &s;uffer any of my People to &s;ettle beyond it. By your Speech it appears to me, that you think the Line is fixed at <HI>Mohonoy;</HI> but by the Deed, which I have not brought with me, and &s;o cannot now produce it, to the be&s;t of my Re|membrance, the Line begins at a certain Mountain, by the River Side, about a Mile above
<PB N="30" REF="009412_0029_0F7404EAC420F220" MS="y">the Mouth of <HI>Mohonoy.</HI> I mu&s;t therefore de&s;ire, that none of your People be permitted to di&s;turb any Per&s;ons within the Limits of that Purcha&s;e, till that Line be &s;ettled.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this String you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to give &s;ome Guns, telling me that you had already made this Reque&s;t four Times.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>At the Conclu&s;ion of this Treaty I propo&s;e to make you a Pre&s;ent, Part of which will con|&s;i&s;t of &s;ome good Guns, which I hope will plea&s;e you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have heard attentively what you &s;aid to your Cou&s;ins, and to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> in particular. Among other Things you &s;ay, you formerly kindled a Fire at <HI>Shamokin,</HI> for <HI>Allumapes;</HI> ano|ther at <HI>Wyoming,</HI> for the <HI>Shawane&s;e;</HI> and others at <HI>Wighalou&s;in</HI> and <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">oga.</HI> You &s;ay to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ca&s;t an evil Eye on the Lands at <HI>Wyoming,</HI> and that he is to watch that Fire, and if any White People come there, to tell them to go away; for that Land belongs to the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Some of you may remember, that at the Treaty held la&s;t Year, at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> the <HI>Six Nations</HI> complained to me, that &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had &s;ettled upon their Lands, and de&s;ired me to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in preventing that Settlement, that they might not be wronged out of their Lands. They told me further, that they heard the Land had been &s;old; that the <HI>Six Nations</HI> never &s;old it, and that tho&s;e who &s;old it &s;tole it from them; that it was two <HI>Tu&s;caroras,</HI> one <HI>Oneida,</HI> and one <HI>Mohawk,</HI> who &s;old it, unknown to the <HI>Six Nations.</HI> To this Reque&s;t I an&s;wered, that a Number of People, from <HI>Connecticut</HI> Government, had &s;ettled at a Place on the River <HI>Delaware,</HI> called <HI>Cu&s;hietunck,</HI> about Fifty Miles North of the <HI>Blue Hills,</HI> being the Settle|ment complained of, and claimed all the Lands from thence quite up to <HI>Wyoming;</HI> that I had &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers to them, to inform them that tho&s;e Lands belonged to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and ordered them to remove away; but they re&s;u&s;ed to do it, a&s;&s;uring me, by the Me&s;&s;engers, that they had purcha&s;ed all tho&s;e Lands of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and under that Pretence had a Right to hold them.</P>
<P>As there are now many more of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> pre&s;ent than were at <HI>Ea&s;ton</HI> la&s;t Year, I again reque&s;t you to tell me plainly, whether the&s;e Strangers are &s;ettled there by your Con|&s;ent or not, and why no Mea&s;ures have been taken, if, as &s;ome of you told me at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> the Lands were not &s;old by you, to oblige tho&s;e private <HI>Indians,</HI> who &s;tole the Land from you, to procure a Surrender of their unju&s;t Deed, from the People to whom they have made it, that it might be brought into the <HI>Onondagoe</HI> Council, and there cancelled or de&s;troyed.</P>
<P><HI>Upon which</HI> Thomas King, <HI>without con&s;ulting any of the other Chiefs, ro&s;e up and &s;poke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>It is very well known that the Land was &s;olo by the <HI>Six Nations;</HI> &s;ome are here now that &s;old that Land; it was &s;old for <HI>Two Thou&s;and Dollars,</HI> but it was not &s;old by our Con&s;ent in public Council; it was as it were &s;tolen from us. Some People &s;aid that my Name was to it, on which I went down immediately to <HI>Connecticut,</HI> to &s;ee whether it was or not, and found it was not. I brought a Paper back from <HI>Connecticut,</HI> which I &s;hall &s;hew to the Governor. Had I not gone down to <HI>Connecticut,</HI> the Lands would have been all &s;ettled up to <HI>Wyoming,</HI> as &s;ar as <HI>Awicka,</HI> Twelve Miles on this Side <HI>Chenango.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas King</HI> being then a&s;ked, whether tho&s;e Lands at <HI>Cu&s;hietunck</HI> were a Part of tho&s;e Lands that were &s;tolen from them? He an&s;wered, they had nothing to do with them; they belonged to the <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Governor a&s;ked, whether the Lands above the Hills, and at <HI>Cu&s;hietunck</HI> in par|ticular, belonged to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> or to the <HI>Delawares?</HI> this was a&s;ked of all the <HI>Six Na|tions</HI> pre&s;ent, and the Governor de&s;ired they would all give an An&s;wer to it, <HI>Thomas King</HI> hav|ing already &s;aid that tho&s;e Lands belonged to the <HI>Delawares.</HI> They an&s;wered, that they would take it into Council, and give him an An&s;wer in Writing.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Conference broke up for the pre&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD><HI>At a</HI> CONFERENCE <HI>with the</HI> Indians, <HI>held at</HI> Lanca&s;ter, <HI>on</HI> Friday, <HI>the Twenty|&s;eventh of</HI> Augu&s;t, 1762.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT, <HI>The Honourable</HI> JAMES HAMILTON, <HI>E&s;quire, &amp;c. &amp;c. as before.</HI></P>
<P>THE Governor continuing his Speeches to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this String I inform you, that a few Days &s;ince your Cou&s;ins, the We&s;tern <HI>Indians,</HI> ap|plied to me about our Trade with them, and told me that we &s;old our Goods very dear, and de&s;ired we would &s;ell them cheaper; on which I informed them that I had, for their Benefit, opened a large Store of Goods at <HI>Pitt&s;burgh,</HI> and had appointed hone&s;t Men there to deal ju&s;tly with them, and made no Doubt but they had done &s;o; but that our Land Carriage was &s;o long, and made the Expences &s;o very high, that we lo&s;t Money by the Trade every Year; and that I know of no other Method, by which we could &s;upply them cheaper, than by your &s;uffering us to go up the We&s;tern Branch of the <HI>Sa&s;quehannah</HI> River, with Boats or Canoes, and to build &s;ome &s;mall Store Hou&s;es, to put our Goods and Skins in, as we went up and came down that River. This Liberty I told them I would apply to you for, and I now de&s;ire you will be free, and tell me whether you will con&s;ent that we &s;hould build &s;uch Store Hou&s;es there, being un|willing to do any Thing of that Kind, without having fir&s;t obtained your Approbation, or to give you the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to think we intend to &s;ettle any of the Lands there.</P>
<P>If you approve of this Propo&s;al, I will &s;end proper Per&s;ons to view that River, and to &s;ee how far Boats or Canoes can go up it; and I de&s;ire the People I &s;hall &s;end upon that Service may be under your Protection, and treated as your Friends, by any of your People they may happen to meet with in their Journey.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> Kinderuntie, <HI>the head Warrior of the</HI> Seneca <HI>Nation, &s;uddenly ro&s;e up, and &s;poke as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>You have laid out two Roads already; one you told me was a good one, the other leads from <HI>Potowmack,</HI> and now you want another Road to go by Water; we cannot grant it to you, becau&s;e our chief old Men are not here; we are chiefly Warriors here; I am almo&s;t as chief a Man as any among them, but we cannot grant it to you, becau&s;e our chief Men are not pre&s;ent, and the Matter has not been con&s;ulted in Council. I give you this An&s;wer now, becau&s;e I have the Care of tho&s;e Lands; but if it is agreed upon in our Council, that will be another Thing; but at pre&s;ent we deny you entirely.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember you told me, when you was going to <HI>Pitt&s;burgh,</HI> you would build a Fort again&s;t the <HI>French;</HI> and you told me that you wanted none of our Lands; our Cou&s;ins know this, and that you promi&s;ed to go away as &s;oon as you drove the <HI>French</HI> away, and yet you &s;tay there, and build Hou&s;es, and make it &s;tronger and &s;tronger every Day; for this Rea&s;on we entirely deny your Reque&s;t; you &s;hall not have a Road this Way.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To which the Governor an&s;wered,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>This Reque&s;t did not ari&s;e from me; I only mentioned it, in order to oblige your Cou&s;ins, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> who defired a Trade with us, and I did it that they might have their Goods cheaper; but this is an indifferent Matter to me; it particularly concerns your Cou&s;ins, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and the We&s;tern <HI>Indians;</HI> and &s;ince the <HI>Six Nations</HI> di&s;approve of our going up and down the We&s;t Branch, and building Store Hou&s;es there, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing further up|on this Subject.</P>
<P><HI>To which the</HI> Seneca <HI>Chief made An&s;wer,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I am glad to hear you, as you &s;ay it did not come from you, but that it came from our Cou&s;ins; I thought it had been your own Propo&s;al. I really quite wonder at my Cou&s;ins, that they did not tell me this; but &s;ince they have &s;wallowed up all their own Land, and live to the We&s;tward, I believe they are growing proud. The Lands do belong to me where they live; I conquered it with my Sword; but they are grown proud, and will, I &s;uppo&s;e, not own us for their Uncles.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="009412_0031_0F7404EC37985878">
The Governor an&s;wered, that if he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in &s;uch a Manner to them, as if the Application did come from him&s;elf, he was mi&s;taken; for that he meant to expre&s;s him&s;elf, that he did it in Con&s;equence of the <HI>Delawares</HI> de&s;iring a Trade with us, and that our Goods might come cheaper to them, and that he knew of no other Method of rendering them &s;o, but by Means of a Water Carriage; and therefore he told the <HI>Delawares</HI> that he would apply to their Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> for Liberty to carry our Goods up the We&s;t Branch of <HI>Sa&s;|quehannah;</HI> and he de&s;ired that they &s;hould not think the <HI>Delawares</HI> in Fault, on this Account, as they did not propo&s;e this Method to him; and that no Blame &s;hould be imputed to them at all in this Affair; and that as he found it di&s;agreeable to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> he would &s;ay nothing further about it.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor then proceeded to &s;peak to the</HI> Six Nations <HI>at follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt you de&s;ired, that as there was no War now between you and us, and the Fort at <HI>Shamokin</HI> &s;tood upon your Warriors Path, the Soldiers might be removed from that Garri|&s;on; but that the Trading Hou&s;e might &s;till continue, that your Hunter and Warriors might be &s;upplied with Goods; and further de&s;ired to know what Prices we &s;et upon our Goods.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that though an End be happily put to the Was between the <HI>Indians</HI> and us, yet it &s;till continues as warm as ever between as and the <HI>French,</HI> and therefore with|out His Maje&s;ty's expre&s;s Orders, at who&s;e In&s;tance you acknowledge it was built, by your own Con&s;ent, I cannot remove the Soldiers from that Garri&s;on. I &s;hall give particular Di|rections to the Commanding Officer, that the Soldiers behave very well, both to your War|riors and Hunters, when they come there; and if the Waniors behave well on their Parts, and keep &s;ober, there can be no Differences between them.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You further de&s;ire, by this Belt, that the Per&s;on who has the Care of the Provincial Store may be removed, and an hone&s;t Man put in his Place.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Agent at <HI>Shamokin</HI> has, &s;o far as I know, &s;upported the Character of an hone&s;t Man; but as it &s;eems he is not agreeable to you, I will con&s;ult with the Gentlemen who are joined with me in the Direction of that Store Hou&s;e, when I return to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and give you an An&s;wer at a proper Time.</P>
<P>As to the Trading Hou&s;e, it &s;hall continue, for your Convenience and Accommodation; but it is not in my Power to fix any certain Price upon our Goods. You know we don't make the Goods our&s;elves; they are made in <HI>England,</HI> and the tran&s;porting them over the Seas is dangerous in War Time, and very expen&s;ive, &s;o that they mu&s;t come much dearer now than in Time of Peace, and their Prices change, as the Ri&s;que and Demand for them is greater or le&s;s; but I am told, that they are &s;old to you as cheap as they can be afforded, and cheaper than they can be purcha&s;ed from private Traders, and Care will be taken that they be good in their Quality.</P>

<P>By this Belt you give it as your Opinion, that <HI>John Harris's</HI> Hou&s;e, &s;tanding on your War|riors Path, would be a good Place for a Trading Hou&s;e, for the Accommodation of your Warriors and Hunters, and de&s;ire one may be erected there, and recommend <HI>John Harris</HI> to be Store-keeper.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By the Relation you gave me at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> in 1758, when you was relating the Cau&s;es of the War, it appears that you were of Opinion, one of the principal Rea&s;ons which made you join the <HI>French</HI> again&s;t us, was owing in a great Mea&s;ure to the ill Treatment your Warriors met with in <HI>Virginia,</HI> in tho&s;e Places where your War Path pa&s;&s;es through the &s;ettled Part of that Colony; and you have now de&s;ired me to write to the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> that as there are Settlers on your War Path, whereby it is &s;topped, he would cau&s;e it to be opened.</P>
<P>Now, Brethren, I mu&s;t acquaint you, that all the Way from <HI>Harris's</HI> Ferry to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, the White People are &s;ettled very thick, &s;o that &s;hould your Warriors now u&s;e that Path, fre|quent Differences between them and the Inhabitants might probably ari&s;e, by means whereof, the Peace &s;o lately e&s;tabli&s;hed between us may be endangered. And I mu&s;t de&s;ire you, for
<PB N="33" REF="009412_0032_0F7404EE6850C148">this Rea&s;on, to u&s;e your be&s;t Intere&s;t with your Warriors, in ca&s;e they are determined to go to War, that they would pur&s;ue the old War Path from <HI>Shamokin,</HI> which lies along the Foot of the <HI>Allegheny Hills,</HI> and which is the neare&s;t Way they can go to their Enemies Country.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As you tell me you intend to apply immediately to Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> to give Orders that the Warriors be &s;upplied with Nece&s;&s;aries, through Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> at <HI>Rays-Town,</HI> I mu&s;t refer you to him, that the &s;ame may be done in other of the King's Garri&s;ons, along the War Path.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>John Harris's</HI> Hou&s;e is a great Deal out of the Way, if more Trading Hou&s;es &s;hall hereafter be thought nece&s;&s;ary than there are at pre&s;ent, which we &s;hall con&s;ider of, we &s;hall take Care to &s;ix them at the mo&s;t convenient Places, for the Accommodation of our <HI>Indian</HI> Brethren, and appoint hone&s;t Men to take the Direction of the Trade, who will deal ju&s;tly and kindly with all the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt you de&s;ire a Trading Hou&s;e may be erected on <HI>Potowmack,</HI> at <HI>Daniel Cre&s;&s;ip's</HI> Hou&s;e, and that he may have the Care of it, for the Supply of your Warriors, and that I will &s;end your Reque&s;t to the Governor of <HI>Maryland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Your Belt, and all you have &s;aid upon it, &s;hall be carefully &s;ent to Governor <HI>Sharpe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall al&s;o, agreeable to your Reque&s;t, tran&s;mit your Belt, and what you have &s;aid upon it, to the Governor of <HI>Virginia;</HI> and I &s;hall lo&s;e no Time in doing it, as your Warriors, you tell me, are now ready to &s;et out.</P>

<P>Agreeable to your Reque&s;t, the Per&s;ons whom I &s;hall appoint to attend you, on your Re|turn Home, will have Orders to &s;urni&s;h you with Provi&s;ions, as far as <HI>Shamokin.</HI> I have re|ceived &s;everal Complaints of great Mi&s;chief being done by the <HI>Indians,</HI> in their coming here, and therefore mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon it that you re&s;train your young Men from committing any fur|ther Violence, or from taking any Thing from the Inhabitants in their Return; for this mu&s;t have a natural Tendency to rai&s;e ill Blood in the Minds of the People.</P>

<P>As to the Application made by your Friends at <HI>Wighalou&s;in,</HI> with re&s;pect to Lands they lay Claim to beyond the Mountains, I am &s;urprized this &s;hould be mentioned to me by <HI>Tokabaion,</HI> after what pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> In the Year 1758, between me and the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> re&s;pecting tho&s;e Lands. Their Deed to the Proprietaries for tho&s;e Lands was then produced, and was acknowledged to have been executed by the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> &s;ome of whom were then pre&s;ent. They further added, that they had &s;old the Land in Que&s;tion, and were hone&s;tly paid for it, and that the Land was theirs, and they would ju&s;tify it; the&s;e were their Expre&s;&s;ions. This being the Cafe, and we being unacquainted with any Rights they have, mu&s;t refer them to you, and de&s;ire you will &s;ettle this Matter among your&s;elves.</P>

<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt you tell me, that your Grandfathers advi&s;ed you to keep fa&s;t Hold of the Chain of Friend&s;hip, and that you, the <HI>Mohawks, Oneidas, Senecas, Onondagoes, Cayugas,</HI> and <HI>Tu&s;|caroras,</HI> have brought about the Peace; that you have more Brothers, Friends and Allies to the We&s;tward, as far as the Sun &s;ets, &s;o many that you cannot tell their Numbers; and in Behalf of them and your&s;elves, who now make up fourteen Nations, you make our old Friend&s;hip new again, and brighten the Covenant Chain.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You know that when the Peace was concluded fir&s;t between us, at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> as well as in &s;everal friendly Conferences held afterwards, we both of us took great Pains to &s;end the Peace Belt among all your Nations, and among your Friends and Allies, to the mo&s;t di&s;tant Parts; and we have heard you &s;ay with Plea&s;ure, and we have our&s;elves likewi&s;e received Me&s;&s;ages from &s;everal <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, that they were glad to hear we had made Peace together, and joined heartily in it.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We thank you for renewing your old Friend&s;hip; we very heartily join with you in it, and in brightening the Covenant Chain, and confirm our Words with this Belt. When you re|turn Home, we de&s;ire you will &s;hew this Belt to your own People, and to all the Nations in your Alliance, and let them know how friendly your Brothers have received you; advi&s;e them not to hearken to any Stories that bad People may tell them, to our Prejudice; de&s;ire them to &s;top their Ears to all &s;uch Stories, and a&s;&s;ure them that we &s;hall, on all Occa&s;ions, pre&s;erve our Friend&s;hip with our <HI>Indian</HI> Brethren, and their Allies.

<P>As I have now fini&s;hed all my Bu&s;ine&s;s with you, I inform you, that as the good People of this Province think you may want &s;ome Cloathing, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, they have, from the Regard they have for you, put into my Hands a confiderable Pre&s;ent of Goods, which I &s;hall deliver to &s;uch Per&s;ons as you &s;hall appoint to receive and divide them; and I defire, that in the dividing them you will pay particular Regard, and give an hand&s;ome Pre&s;ent to &s;uch <HI>Indians</HI> who have been at any Expence and Trouble in bringing down the Pri&s;oners.</P>

<P>I mentioned to you, the other Day, my De&s;ire that there &s;hould be a Store Hou&s;e kept at <HI>John Harris's,</HI> and that he might have the Care of the Store for the Warriors. I de&s;ired, at the &s;ame Time, that the Road might be opened for the Warriors, to pa&s;s through the back Settlements to the Southern <HI>Indians;</HI> you know we are, and always have been at War with them, and I &s;hall now begin to &s;trike them. You told me, in An&s;wer, that you thought it be&s;t that that Road &s;hould be &s;topt up, left any Differences &s;hould ari&s;e between your People and our Warriors; and de&s;ired, if any Warriors did go to War, they would take the old Road that led to the Southward, under the Mountains; and I now tell you, that as you de&s;ired that Road &s;hould be &s;topt, it &s;hall be &s;o, and I will take the old Road. We don't now de&s;ire a Store Hou&s;e &s;hould be kept at <HI>John Harris's</HI> for the Warriors, but that he may be &s;upplied with Provi&s;ions, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, for our Chiefs and old Men, as they pa&s;s to and fro about the good Work of Peace.
