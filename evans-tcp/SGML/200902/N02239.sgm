<OPENER><SALUTE>SYR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is mentioned among the Occurrences of a very &s;orrowful Time, <HI>A Man's Uncle &s;hall take him up.</HI> It &s;eems, upon a <HI>Young Man's Dying,</HI> 'tis look'd for, that his <HI>Uncle</HI> &s;hould perform the part of a <HI>Father</HI> to him. I am now to do it, on the behalf of a <HI>de&s;irable Young Man,</HI> who was to me not unlike what a <HI>Si&s;ters Son</HI> was to <HI>Paul;</HI> and who&s;e <HI>Death</HI> makes a &s;orrowful Time for us: Herein al&s;o an <HI>Uncle</HI> attempts to abate the Sorrows of a <HI>Father.</HI> And tho' no <HI>Word</HI> in any other Language can ex|pre&s;s, what the Hebrew has in its <HI>CHESED,</HI> for our <HI>Duty to the Dead;</HI> yet the <HI>Thing</HI> I am now in my poor way endeavouring.</P>
<P>When the lovely Young <HI>Cae&s;arius,</HI> the Son of the ble&s;&s;ed Old <HI>Gregorius,</HI> died before his Father, <HI>Nazianzen</HI> in his Funeral Oration upon him, compared his <HI>Father</HI> unto an <HI>Aaron</HI> in the Hou&s;e of his GOD. I am &s;ure, there is One thing in an <HI>Aaron,</HI> which is not unworthy of <HI>Your</HI> Imi|tation on this Occa&s;ion; As he was a great <HI>Sa|crificer,</HI> &s;o when a &s;ad Thing befel his Family,

<P>Your Excellent Predece&s;&s;or, the Venerable and Memorable ELIOT, burying a valuable <HI>Son,</HI> &s;oon after the Young Man's entrance upon the Work of the Evangelical Work of the Mini|&s;try, the brave old Man &s;aid upon it, <HI>My De&s;ire was, that my Son &s;hould have &s;erved CHRIST on Earth; but if GOD will chu&s;e to have him &s;erve Him in Heaven, I have nothing to object again&s;t it; But His Will be done.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Son,</HI> in whom You have had the uncom|mon Satisfaction of having him joined with you, in the <HI>Pa&s;toral Care</HI> of the Church, where|in you <HI>had proof of him, that as a Son with a Father, he &s;erved with you in the Go&s;pel,</HI> mu&s;t now go from <HI>Earth</HI> to <HI>&s;erve CHRIST in Heaven</HI> before You.

<P>THE De&s;ign at this Time is, to <HI>pre&s;s</HI> as many as will be per&s;waded, into the <HI>Service</HI> of a <HI>great King, who&s;e Name is Venerable.</HI> And that we may all now become the <HI>willing People</HI> of a Lord, who will accept of none but <HI>&s;uch,</HI> Behold, what that <HI>Service</HI> will bring us to. I &s;how unto you the <HI>Encouragement,</HI> which the <HI>King of Glory</HI> gives un|to all His faithful <HI>Servants.</HI> You are now in|formed and a&s;&s;ured from the Glorious Lord, That you &s;hall be <HI>with Him;</HI> which is to &s;ay, That you &s;hall be in a &s;tate of <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s:</HI> Yea, and in that &s;tate, there will be a&s;toni&s;hing <HI>Ho|nours,</HI> which the <HI>FATHER</HI> of our SAVIOUR &s;hall concur with Him, in be&s;towing upon you.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002666_0005_0FE5FA3EEB3FE258">
Our SAVIOUR was told by &s;ome of His Di&s;ciples, That there were &s;ome <HI>Gentiles</HI> de&s;irous of a private Admi&s;&s;ion unto Him. Upon this Occa&s;ion our SAVIOUR fore&s;ees the &s;peedy Approach of the Hour, when he &s;hould be <HI>glo|rified among the Gentiles;</HI> and &s;ee a <HI>&s;urrogate I&s;rael.</HI> But at the &s;ame Time, He declares the unex|pected way, in which He mu&s;t arrive to this <HI>Glorification;</HI> the &s;trange and black <HI>Preliminary</HI> that mu&s;t lead unto it. It mu&s;t be, by <HI>Death;</HI> even by <HI>Death;</HI> As a Grain of <HI>Corn</HI> mu&s;t lie for <HI>Dead</HI> in the Earth, before it fructifies. Our SAVIOUR having foretold what was to be <HI>His</HI> own Condition, He foretels, what mu&s;t al&s;o be the Condition of <HI>them</HI> that will <HI>&s;erve</HI> Him; He forewarns them to expect a Conformity to Him, in <HI>Sufferings,</HI> preparatory to the Be&s;&s;edne&s;s wherein He will have them to be a&s;&s;ociated with Him. <HI>Hard Lines! Dark Strokes!</HI> No Man <HI>&s;erve</HI> our Lord JESUS CHRIST, or hope to be <HI>with Him,</HI> unle&s;s he be willing to <HI>Die</HI> like Him, to <HI>Die</HI> for Him! <HI>Fle&s;h and Blood; What wilt thou &s;ay to This!</HI>&mdash;To fortify His Followers, our SAVIOUR now tells them, what will be the Con&s;equence, and what will be done for them. This particularly, That His <HI>Father</HI> will put wonderful <HI>Honours</HI> upon them. And this is the DOCTRINE which is now to animate us in the ways of our GOD.</P>
<P><HI>Wonderful, wonderful, will be the Honours, which the True Servants of our SAVIOUR, will find His Eternal FATHER to be&s;tow upon them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002666_0005_0FE5FA3EEB3FE258">
The Glorious <HI>FATHER</HI> of our Great <HI>Savi|our,</HI> will <HI>honour</HI> them, who faithfully <HI>&s;erve</HI> the <HI>Son of His Love.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. You &s;hall have &s;et before you, in the fir&s;t place, the <HI>Character</HI> of tho&s;e who &s;tand <HI>Candidates</HI> for <HI>Happine&s;s.</HI> They are the True SERVANTS of our SAVIOUR. They mu&s;t <HI>&s;erve me,</HI> &s;aith our SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>But let us enquire, <HI>Who are the True Servants of our SAVIOUR?</HI> And let us attempt a De|&s;cription of them: For, <HI>Happy are thy Men, Hap|py are thy Servants, that &s;tand continually before thee,</HI> O our SAVIOUR. It may in general be &s;aid, All the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are to be known by that Motto, Phil. I. 21. <HI>To me to live is CHRIST.</HI> CHRIST is He whom they <HI>live</HI> unto. CHRIST is He whom they <HI>live</HI> upon. A CHRIST is the <HI>Fountain of Life</HI> unto them all.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t' be more particular.</P>
<P>Now, Fir&s;t; You may be &s;ure, The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR mu&s;t be &s;uch as <HI>Believe</HI> on Him. 'Tis the Term for a <HI>Believer,</HI> 1 Cor. VII. 22. <HI>He is the Servant of CHRIST.</HI> A <HI>Faith</HI> in our SAVIOUR is a Nece&s;&s;ary Introduction unto the <HI>&s;erving</HI> of Him. No Man can become a <HI>Ser|vant</HI> of our SAVIOUR, without <HI>believing</HI> Him to be, what His Go&s;pel has revealed Him to be, and without <HI>believing</HI> on him for all the Good which His Go&s;pel has promi&s;ed unto His Peo|ple.
<PB N="4" REF="002666_0006_0FE5F9FB12943DA8">Every <HI>Servant</HI> of our SAVIOUR, is in|expre&s;&s;ibly affected with the Glory of His <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> and with the Truth of His <HI>exceeding great and precious Promi&s;es;</HI> and accordingly clo&s;es with Him. The very fir&s;t Thing in becoming a <HI>Ser|vant</HI> of our SAVIOUR is, to &s;ee and &s;ay, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, Thou art no le&s;s than the CHRIST, the Son of the Living GOD; and all the Ble&s;&s;ings of Wi&s;dom and Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Sanctifying and Re|demption are to be expected from thee alone; And for all the&s;e I come unto thee, as unto my only SA|VIOUR: With a peri&s;hing and a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul, I come unto thee.</HI></P>
<P>We will go on to &s;ay, Secondly; The <HI>Ser|vants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are &s;uch as attend upon Him, for all that mu&s;t bring them to <HI>live unto God.</HI> Our SAVIOUR has no <HI>Servants,</HI> but tho&s;e <HI>Regenerate</HI> ones, who have a <HI>new Bia&s;s</HI> upon their Minds, di&s;po&s;ing them to <HI>live</HI> not unto <HI>Them&s;elves</HI> but unto GOD; and find that in GOD, which they have heretofore, &s;ought in <HI>Idols.</HI> Now the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, have their Eyes unto <HI>Him,</HI> that <HI>He</HI> may do all that is needful for their <HI>living</HI> unto GOD. Their Addre&s;s to Him is that; P&s;al. CXXIII. 2. <HI>Be|hold, As the Eyes of Servants look to the Hand of their Ma&s;ters, &s;o our Eyes are upon the Lord our God, until that He have mercy on us.</HI> That we may <HI>live</HI> unto GOD it is required, that we be <HI>Recon|ciled</HI> unto Him, and that the Sentence of <HI>Death,</HI> which His violated Law has pa&s;&s;ed upon us,
<PB N="5" REF="002666_0006_0FE5F9FB12943DA8">may be taken off. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVI|OUR look to Him for this; and thus hope in Him; <HI>O my SAVIOUR, Let thy SACRIFICE be the Expiation of my Sin, and my Reconciliation to GOD, whom I have offended by my Sin.</HI> That we may <HI>live</HI> unto GOD, it is requi&s;ite, that we be <HI>directed</HI> from above. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVI|OUR look to Him for this <HI>Direction,</HI> and &s;o call on Him, <HI>O Lord, &s;hew me thy Ways, teach me thy Paths.</HI> That we may <HI>live</HI> unto GOD, it is requi&s;ite, that we be <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;ted</HI> from above. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR look to Him for this <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tance;</HI> and &s;o <HI>lean</HI> on Him, <HI>I can do all things thro' CHRIST who &s;trengthens me.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are &s;uch as make it their Study to yield an univer&s;al and perpetual <HI>Obedience</HI> unto Him. Our SAVI|OUR demands it of all that would <HI>&s;erve</HI> Him; Matth. XI. 29. <HI>Take my Yoke upon you.</HI> The <HI>Golden Yoke</HI> which our SAVIOUR will have all that <HI>&s;erve</HI> Him, to take upon them, is that <HI>Mo|ral Law,</HI> the Sum whereof is, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart,</HI> and, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy &s;elf.</HI> Our SAVIOUR having delivered us from the <HI>Cur&s;e,</HI> to which the <HI>Law</HI> condemns us for our Breaches of it, now requires us to make this <HI>Law</HI> the <HI>Rule</HI> of our <HI>Life,</HI> and endeavour the mo&s;t exact <HI>Obedience</HI> to it, and Condemn, and Humble and Aba&s;e our &s;elves, when we fall &s;hort of Exactne&s;s in our <HI>Obedience.</HI> This endeavour after the mo&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="002666_0007_0FE5FB4065017708">con&s;ummate <HI>Obedience</HI> to the <HI>Law,</HI> is to be our Expre&s;&s;ion of our <HI>Thankfulne&s;s</HI> to our SAVIOUR, for His Redeeming us from the <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> and Re&s;cuing us into a <HI>better Covenant.</HI> The <HI>Ten Commandments</HI> are now the <HI>Command|ments</HI> of our SAVIOUR; and by becoming His, we <HI>E&s;tabli&s;h the Law.</HI> Accordingly, if we would approve our &s;elves the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, we mu&s;t &s;incerely intend and pur|&s;ue, a full <HI>Obedience</HI> to all of <HI>His Commandments.</HI> The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, labour to <HI>know</HI> the <HI>Duty,</HI> which He demands from them; and they &s;ay, <HI>Lord, What wilt thou have me to do?</HI> They labour to <HI>do</HI> all that they <HI>know</HI> to be their <HI>Duty;</HI> and they &s;ay, <HI>Lord, I count all thy Precepts concerning all things to be right, and I hate every fal&s;e way.</HI> They lament it as their Mi&s;ery, when|ever they Sin again&s;t the <HI>Law of CHRIST.</HI> They can &s;ay, <HI>His Commandments are not grievous.</HI> But it is their <HI>Grief,</HI> that His <HI>Commandments</HI> are no better obeyed with them. In the whole <HI>Cour&s;e</HI> of their <HI>Life,</HI> they aim at <HI>Obedience</HI> unto their SA|VIOUR. Yea, in all the <HI>Work</HI> of their <HI>Life,</HI> this is their Aim. Even the <HI>Work</HI> of their <HI>Tem|poral</HI> Calling, the <HI>Work</HI> of their <HI>Secular</HI> Bu&s;ine&s;s, is done upon this Intention; <HI>'Tis the Work which my SAVIOUR has a&s;&s;igned unto me!</HI> Their SAVI|OUR is <HI>obey'd,</HI> in the mo&s;t <HI>common Actions,</HI> which their <HI>Hand finds to do. Obedience</HI> to Him, is the <HI>Life of their Hand,</HI> in the doing of them.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002666_0007_0FE5FB4065017708">
Fourthly. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are &s;uch as chu&s;e it, and make it, their <HI>Main Concern,</HI> to bear <HI>Te&s;timonies</HI> unto His <HI>Truths,</HI> &amp; His <HI>Ways,</HI> and therein to <HI>Glorify</HI> Him. We have the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, &s;o &s;poken of, and &s;poken to; I&s;a. XLIII. 10. <HI>Ye are my Wit|ne&s;&s;es, &s;aith the Lord, and my Servants whom I have cho&s;en.</HI> The Thing whereto the&s;e <HI>Witne&s;&s;es</HI> of the Lord are called, is that which is called, <HI>A confe&s;&s;ing of our SAVIOUR,</HI> and, <HI>A &s;hewing forth of His Prai&s;es.</HI> The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, have their Souls enamoured on this Employment, this rare Employment, this high Employment; and they mo&s;t heartily &s;ay upon it, <HI>This is all my Salvation, and all my De&s;ire.</HI> They would in all po&s;&s;ible Methods <HI>Te&s;tify,</HI> That their SAVI|OUR is the <HI>Lord of Glory;</HI> That His <HI>Truths</HI> are <HI>Faithful Sayings, and worthy of all Acceptation;</HI> That His <HI>Ways</HI> are <HI>plea&s;ant</HI> ones, and <HI>all His Paths are Peace.</HI> Yea, they would fill their <HI>Lives</HI> with &s;uch <HI>Te&s;timonies.</HI> And they would make it the <HI>chief End</HI> of their <HI>Life</HI> to bear &s;uch <HI>Te&s;timo|nies.</HI> The Breathings of their very Souls with|in them, are, <HI>O that I may cau&s;e the Name of my dear SAVIOUR, to be honourably thought of!</HI> To this End, their Souls do exceedingly breath after this; <HI>O that I may evermore &s;et my Seal, unto all the Truths which my SAVIOUR has betru&s;ted and enriched His Church withal.</HI> Their Souls do ve|hemently breathe after this; <HI>O that I may ever|more give and &s;how my Approbation of the Ways which
<PB N="8" REF="002666_0008_0FE5FB41F789E158">my SAVIOUR has pre&s;cribed as Holy and Ju&s;t and Good.</HI> They would <HI>Live,</HI> yea, they would al&s;o <HI>Die</HI> for the bearing of &s;uch <HI>Te&s;timonies</HI> to the Cau&s;e of our SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>Fifthly. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are &s;uch as make a free, a full, an everla&s;ting <HI>Re&s;ig|nation</HI> of them&s;elves and their All, unto Him. Concerning the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, there has been this Account given; 2 Cor. VIII. 5. <HI>They have given them&s;elves unto the Lord.</HI> Ask them, <HI>Who&s;e are you?</HI> Every one of them will reply with all the Alacrity imaginable, <HI>I am the Lord's!</HI> The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, do in the mo&s;t <HI>Voluntary</HI> manner, con&s;ent and re&s;olve to be His, and make a <HI>Dedication</HI> of them&s;elves unto Him, for all that <HI>Service,</HI> which it may plea&s;e Him to u&s;e them in. Coming in|to the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD, they then &s;ign <HI>Inden|tures</HI> for the <HI>Service</HI> of their SAVIOUR. Upon this, they become de&s;irous, to be entirely the Lord's, and have their <HI>All</HI> u&s;ed in what <HI>Service</HI> He will have it put unto; and they comply with that Call; <HI>Ye are bought with a Price; there|fore Glorify GOD in your Bodie, and in your Spirit, which belong to GOD.</HI> Yea, not only for the Application of their <HI>Bodies,</HI> and of their <HI>Spirits,</HI> to the <HI>Service</HI> of their SAVIOUR, but in apply|ing their <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions</HI> al&s;o unto it, they become, <HI>A People of Free-will offerings.</HI> As their Voice is, <HI>CHRIST is my All,</HI> &s;o their Voice is, <HI>CHRIST &s;hall have my All.</HI> But will they ever grow wea|ry
<PB N="9" REF="002666_0008_0FE5FB41F789E158">of the <HI>Service?</HI> No; They all &s;ay, <HI>I love my Ma&s;ter, and I will not go out from him;</HI> &s;o they have their <HI>Ears bored</HI> for a <HI>Service,</HI> which is all <HI>Delight</HI> unto them; All, a <HI>Delight in GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly. the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR are &s;uch as appear in His <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> and for the Defence of His <HI>Kingdom,</HI> in the World. It was of old cried out; Exod. XXXII. 26. <HI>Who is on the Lords &s;ide?</HI> And it is a Di&s;tinction to be made, in every Generation. Upon this, the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, <HI>gather them&s;elves</HI> unto Him; and <HI>&s;ay unto their Father, and unto their Mother, I have not &s;een them; neither do they acknowledge their Brethren, nor know their own Children.</HI> The <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of PIETY, is the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of our SAVIOUR; &s;o far as PIETY prevails, the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of our SAVIOUR advances, &amp; flouri&s;hes. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR will &s;till appear in the De|fence of PIETY Our SAVIOUR has His <HI>Ene|mies</HI> in the World. The <HI>Enemies</HI> of PIETY are the <HI>Enemies</HI> of our SAVIOUR. They make Ho&s;tile Inva&s;ions on His <HI>Kingdom;</HI> which lies in <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR will &s;till appear again&s;t the&s;e <HI>Enemies.</HI> They are <HI>Souldiers</HI> for Him; Li&s;ted under His <HI>Banners;</HI> having His <HI>Marh</HI> on their Foreheads. They will openly a&s;&s;ert His Intere&s;t, and oppo&s;e the Adver&s;aries thereof, and venture ther All in do|ing &s;o: <HI>Not love their Lives unto the Death.</HI></P>
<P>Seventhly. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR are &s;uch as have <HI>no Will</HI> of their own; &s;uch as
<PB N="10" REF="002666_0009_0FE5FB438D504B70">are entirely governed by the <HI>Will</HI> of their SA|VIOUR; entirely at His Di&s;po&s;e. This is what <HI>Servants</HI> mu&s;t come to! This is the Language always heard from the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR; Act. XXI. 14. <HI>The Will of the Lord be done.</HI> The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are willing to Do, all tho&s;e things, whereof it may be &s;aid, <HI>This is the Will of God in CHRIST Je&s;us concerning you.</HI> The Things may be <HI>Hard Sayings,</HI> and their <HI>carnal Mind</HI> ri&s;e up in Rebellion a|gain&s;t the Things, and they feel a rebellious <HI>Will</HI> &s;tirring in them&s;elves; yet they conform to the <HI>Will</HI> of their SAVIOUR, and mortify and extingui&s;h their own. Yea, If it be the <HI>Will</HI> of their SAVIOUR, that they &s;hould <HI>&s;uffer</HI> uncom|fortable Things, here they yield a profound Submi&s;&s;ion to His <HI>Will.</HI> They have learn'd <HI>in whatever &s;tate they are, to be content,</HI> with the <HI>Will</HI> of their SAVIOUR; <HI>content</HI> with what <HI>&s;tate</HI> the <HI>Will</HI> of their SAVIOUR &s;hall order for them. They <HI>Sacrifice</HI> All to the Will of their SAVI|OUR; All their Enjoyments are bound unto the <HI>Horns of the Altar,</HI> &s;tanding ready to be <HI>&s;acri|ficed.</HI> They &s;till &s;ay, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, Not my Will, but thy Will be done!</HI> And this compliance with the <HI>Will</HI> of their SAVIOUR, is very par|ticularly con&s;picuous, in their &s;ubmitting to <HI>Death,</HI> in the <HI>Time</HI> and in the <HI>Way,</HI> which our SAVIOUR &s;hall appoint, when He will have no further <HI>Service</HI> from them. When the <HI>Ser|vants</HI> of our SAVIOUR have that Order from
<PB N="11" REF="002666_0009_0FE5FB438D504B70">Him, <HI>Go up, and die!</HI>&mdash; 'tis without much Re|luctancy complied withal: They &s;ay, <HI>O Thou Lord of my Life, if I have no more to do for thee, I am willing to die, and with a Love &s;trong as Death, go thro' the dark valley of the &s;hadow of Death, to come unto thee!</HI> The&s;e, the&s;e are the <HI>Servants</HI> of the Lord.</P>
<P>Oh! That you would Examine your &s;elves; <HI>Am I one of the&s;e? How far do I an&s;wer this Cha|racter?</HI> This I will &s;ay; <HI>Behold,</HI> Are ye the <HI>Ser|vants of the Lord,</HI> O you who this Day <HI>&s;tand in the Hou&s;e of the Lord?</HI> Then, <HI>Ble&s;s the Lord.</HI> For, <HI>The Lord who made Heaven and Earth</HI> will <HI>ble&s;s you out of Zion,</HI> and bring you into <HI>Zion,</HI> and no|thing in <HI>Heaven</HI> or <HI>Earth</HI> proper for you, &s;hall be denied unto you.</P>
<P N="2">II. But this is what is in the &s;econd place to be &s;et before you; even the <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> of tho&s;e who come up to this <HI>Character.</HI> Wonderful, wonderful the <HI>Honours,</HI> which the true <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR &s;hall receive of His Eternal FATHER. <HI>My Father will honour them,</HI> &s;aith our SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>But let us Enquire, <HI>What are the HONOURS, which GOD will be&s;tow upon the Servants of our SAVIOUR?</HI></P>
<P>Now, We might &s;uper&s;ede all further An|&s;wer, with &s;uch a general one as that; 1 Cor. II. 9. <HI>Eye hath not &s;een, nor Ear heard, neither hath entred into the Heart of Man, the things which GOD
<PB N="12" REF="002666_0010_0FE5FB451E44BFB0">hath prepared for them that love Him.</HI> The <HI>Honours</HI> prepared for them that <HI>&s;erve</HI> our SAVIOUR; O unutterable <HI>Honours!</HI> O inconceivable <HI>Honours!</HI> O Things <HI>far beyond all that we can ask or think!</HI></P>
<P>We will make one prefatory Remark on the <HI>Honours,</HI> which GOD will be&s;tow upon the <HI>Ser|vants</HI> of our SAVIOUR; They will be &s;uch <HI>Honours,</HI> and &s;o be&s;tow'd, that the Glorious GOD Him&s;elf &s;hall be <HI>honoured</HI> in them. There is a Difference between tho&s;e two; Joh. XII. 43. <HI>The prai&s;e of Men,</HI> and, <HI>The prai&s;e of GOD.</HI> The mo&s;t of Men, if they <HI>honour</HI> us, and admire us, and applaud us, they terminate in the <HI>Creature;</HI> they look no further than <HI>us;</HI> GOD has not His Prai&s;es on the Occa&s;ion; GOD, without whom, and before whom, we are <HI>Nothing,</HI> is not <HI>Remembred.</HI> All comes to <HI>Nothing,</HI> in <HI>Remem|brances</HI> of none but <HI>A&s;hes!</HI> A <HI>&s;acrilegious Idolatry</HI> is committed. A true <HI>Servant</HI> of our SAVIOUR, even deprecates it as an <HI>Infelicity,</HI> to be made the Object in this <HI>Idolatry.</HI> He had rather be left <HI>un|con&s;idered,</HI> in the World. Yea, when he meets with <HI>Indignities</HI> from an ungodly Generation, it &s;weetens them unto him, to think, <HI>I am deliver|ed from the Danger of being made an Idol among the Robbers of GOD.</HI> Yea, Oh! why &s;hould we not pre&s;s after the high Flight of <HI>Nierembergius,</HI> who writes at this rate; <HI>Lord, I had rather, could it be without Sin, that all &s;hould</HI> hate me, <HI>than that they &s;hould</HI> love me for my &s;elf. <HI>If all the World hate
<PB N="13" REF="002666_0010_0FE5FB451E44BFB0">me, I &s;hould have but what is Mine. If they &s;hould love me for my &s;elf, they would u&s;urp what is Thine.</HI> This I will &s;ay, A true <HI>Servant</HI> of CHRIST will be lothe to receive any <HI>Honours,</HI> of which he cannot &s;ee, that GOD and His CHRIST is <HI>honoured</HI> in them. Such Di&s;po&s;itions may be de|rided as fanciful &amp; whim&s;ical <HI>Exta&s;ies,</HI> But, <HI>O my Soul,</HI> do thou pre&s;s after them, and re&s;t not until thou arrive to more Perfection in them!</P>
<P>But, the <HI>Honours</HI> to be be&s;tow'd on the <HI>Ser|vants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are &s;uch as <HI>come</HI> from GOD. Surely then, they will al&s;o <HI>lead</HI> to GOD. GOD will have His <HI>Honours</HI> wondrou&s;ly &s;ecured, expre&s;&s;ed, ob&s;erved in them. In &s;hort therefore; The <HI>Honours</HI> will be <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> wherein the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD unto the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR will be manife&s;ted. The Glorious GOD &s;ays unto the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, as in Rev. III. 9. <HI>I will make them to know, that I have loved thee.</HI> The <HI>Honours</HI> to be be&s;tow'd on them, will be in the <HI>Tokens</HI> of His <HI>Love,</HI> which a Gracious GOD will comfort them, and enrich them, and adorn them withal.</P>
<P>But let the <HI>matter extend</HI> into a little more of Particularity. We &s;hall be told, <HI>what &s;hall be done to the Man,</HI> whom the FATHER of our SAVIOUR <HI>delights to Honour.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t; O ye <HI>Servants</HI> of an incomparable SA|VIOUR; I am &s;ure, you count it the greate&s;t of <HI>Honours,</HI> to be the <HI>Servants</HI> of &s;uch a SAVI|OUR. No <HI>Dignity,</HI> No <HI>Preferment,</HI> on Earth, to

Will the Glorious GOD accept you to <HI>&s;erve</HI> the <HI>King</HI> whom He hath placed on His Throne; and employ you in the <HI>Service</HI> of Him, that is the <HI>King of Kings</HI> and the <HI>Lord of all?</HI> I am &s;ure, you will &s;ay, <HI>This is Honour enough! My Ambition cannot &s;oar higher than &s;uch an Honour as this!</HI> How can you judge otherwi&s;e, when you call to mind, who are your <HI>Fellow-&s;ervants?</HI> I will not mention &s;uch <HI>Worms of the Du&s;t,</HI> as the Roman Emperours, who have &s;ub&s;cribed them&s;elves, <HI>The Va&s;&s;als of the Lord JE|SUS CHRIST.</HI> They &s;hall vani&s;h before the <HI>Prin|ces</HI> whom I am going to &s;peak of. The Bright <HI>Angels</HI> in the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> all count it their <HI>Honour,</HI> to be the <HI>Servants</HI> of our JESUS on the Throne of GOD, and with Triumphs in it, be|come your <HI>Fellow-&s;ervants.</HI> The lea&s;t of tho&s;e <HI>Mighty Ones,</HI> is greater than the greate&s;t <HI>Mo|narchs</HI> on our little Globe; And of the&s;e <HI>Mighty Ones</HI> how many <HI>Myriads</HI> are there, to whom you make tho&s;e Acclamations in your <HI>&s;erving</HI> of your SAVIOUR! P&s;al. CIII. 20, 21. <HI>O ye His Angels, va&s;t in &s;trength, Ble&s;s ye th' ETERNAL God; who do His Word, that &s;o the Voice of His Word may be heard. O Ble&s;s ye the ETERNAL God, All ye His Mar&s;hall'd Ho&s;ts; Ye Mini&s;ters who Ex|ecute His Will made known to you!</HI> Oh!

<P><PB N="15" REF="002666_0011_0FE5FB46AFDAAFC8">
Pertinently upon this, will come in a &s;econd Satisfaction; While you are the <HI>Servants</HI> of your SAVIOUR, the <HI>Angels</HI> of your SAVIOUR will be your <HI>Guardians.</HI> You no &s;ooner come into the <HI>Service</HI> of your SAVIOUR, but, <HI>Lo, The Morning Stars do &s;ing together, and the Sons of God &s;hout for Joy.</HI> They are glad of your coming be be &s;o a&s;&s;ociated with them; and they gladly come into a <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> for you.

<P>If this ben't enough, take a Third Satisfacti|on. The FATHER of our SAVIOUR be&s;tows this <HI>Honour</HI> on them that <HI>&s;erve</HI> Him; He will be their <HI>Father</HI> too. The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVI|OUR, are all of them, the <HI>Children</HI> of GOD. <HI>Ye are my Sons and my Daughters, faith the Lord Almighty!</HI> And now, <HI>&s;eemeth it a light thing unto you,</HI> to be the <HI>Children</HI> of that Infinite GOD who is the <HI>mo&s;t high Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Heaven and Earth! Children,</HI> who &s;hall be <HI>Heirs</HI> of an Infinite GOD, and therefore &s;hall <HI>inherit all things!</HI> O ye <HI>Ser|vants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, Fall into that agreeable Rapture; 1 Joh. III. 1. <HI>Behold, what manner of Love, the Father has be&s;towed upon us, that we &s;hould
<PB N="16" REF="002666_0012_0FE5FB484BCA47B0">be called the Children of God!</HI> Will GOD the FA|THER put <HI>Honour</HI> upon them that <HI>&s;erve</HI> our SAVIOUR? GOD the SPIRIT will do &s;o too; and this <HI>Honour</HI> does al&s;o proceed from the FATHER.</P>
<P>Behold, a Fourth Satisfaction! The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are all of them, the <HI>Temples</HI> of the Holy SPIRIT. Unto &s;uch it is &s;aid, 1 Cor. III. 16. <HI>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of GOD, and the Spirit of GOD dwelleth in you?</HI> Oh! What an <HI>Honour</HI> have you now a pro&s;pect of!

<P>The Articles of <HI>Honour</HI> will keep growing on our Hands. Let this go for a Fifth of them. A precious <HI>E&s;teem</HI> with the <HI>Be&s;t of Men,</HI> is an <HI>Ho|nour</HI> which they that <HI>&s;erve</HI> the Be&s;t of Lords, are no &s;trangers to.

<PB N="17" REF="002666_0012_0FE5FB484BCA47B0">in Heb. XI. 2. <HI>They obtain a good Report.</HI> It was by <HI>David</HI> thought an <HI>Honour; Let tho&s;e that fear thee, turn to me.</HI> It was by <HI>Paul</HI> thought an <HI>Ho|nour; That my Service may be accepted of the Saints.</HI> This <HI>Honour</HI> is granted unto the <HI>Servants</HI> of our SAVIOUR; They are, as we read <HI>Mordecai</HI> was, <HI>Accepted of the Multitude of their Brethren.</HI> And, if they are Per&s;ons of greater Eminency for their <HI>Diligence,</HI> their <HI>Faithfulne&s;s,</HI> their <HI>U&s;eful|ne&s;s,</HI> the more Eminent often does GOD make them in their E&s;teem among His People.

<P>I will &s;ay, Sixthly; The <HI>Servants</HI> of our SA|VIOUR, often have the <HI>Honour</HI> to be <HI>vilified</HI> by the <HI>vile&s;t of Men;</HI> and by tho&s;e who <HI>exalt</HI> none &s;o much as the <HI>vile&s;t of Men.</HI> Enquire of your <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>'s and your <HI>Luthers</HI> and your <HI>Cal|vins,</HI> and all great Reformers, if it be not &s;o.

No Man &s;hall be a Lo&s;er by any Service he does for Him! 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for any one to make too early a Dedication of him&s;elf unto the Service of this Glorious LORD. All the Labours, and all the Sorrows, and all the &s;ad Things, which mu&s;t be undergone in the Service, are abundantly Re|compen&s;ed in this Glorious World.

<P>Among tho&s;e who have begun to do &s;ome <HI>Service</HI> for our Glorious LORD, and have been <HI>&s;ingularly Furni&s;hed</HI> for it, but might <HI>not be &s;uffered to continue</HI> in it <HI>by rea&s;on of Death,</HI> I know not why a Mode&s;t <HI>Commemoration</HI> may not be allow'd unto Mr. THOMAS WALTER; Who had not pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Four times Seven</HI> Years of a <HI>Pilgrimage,</HI> before a Period unto all Pro&s;pect of any further <HI>Service</HI> from him here, is ha&s;tened upon him.</P>
<P>I am not without Apprehen&s;ion, that it may be &s;ome &s;mall <HI>Service</HI> unto the Be&s;t Intere&s;ts, for me to take a brief Notice of &s;omething that may render his Memory <HI>Valuable,</HI> and &s;omething that may render it <HI>Profitable,</HI> to us.</P>
<P>The former part of his Life,&mdash;I pa&s;s o|ver in <HI>Silence:</HI> But &s;omething that occurr'd in the <HI>Clo&s;e</HI> of it, may be not altogether unworthy of &s;ome Notice with us.</P>
<P>After &s;uch un Uncommon Symptom of <HI>Merit</HI> in him, as his being Ordained by his Venerable <HI>Grandfather,</HI> and In&s;talled a <HI>Collegue</HI> with his De|&s;irable <HI>Father,</HI> in the Pa&s;toral Care of a precious Flock, who for their Generous <HI>Love unto their Mini&s;ters,</HI> have &s;et an Example to all the Churches in the Country; he &s;oon gave Demon&s;trations of tho&s;e Rare <HI>Abilities,</HI> which <HI>exceedingly Di&s;tin|gui&s;hed</HI>

<P>But that which makes him de&s;erve to be re|membred with the more <HI>Honour</HI> among us, is, That his Heart was fixed in his Purpo&s;es and Endeavours to employ all tho&s;e Bright <HI>Abilities</HI> in the <HI>Service</HI> of CHRIST and for the <HI>Churches of This Country.</HI></P>
<P>He was a &s;trong Champion for tho&s;e <HI>Doctrines of Grace,</HI> in which <HI>tho&s;e Churches</HI> have been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; And a great Reader of the Books which a&s;&s;ert tho&s;e <HI>Doctrines;</HI> among which tho&s;e of a Judicious OWEN had a &s;pecial Reli&s;h with him; ever <HI>Lamenting,</HI> ever <HI>Confuting,</HI> the Things which he &s;aw <HI>tending to Corrupt</HI> the young Minds of tho&s;e that are under a De&s;ignation to <HI>feed the Flocks in the high Mountains of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>To which I mu&s;t add, That his faithful and &s;teady Adherence to the <HI>Puritan</HI> Principles of <HI>In&s;tituted Wor&s;hip,</HI> and&mdash; <HI>What &s;aith the Scrip|ture?</HI>&mdash;was very con&s;iderable; when <HI>Tempta|tions</HI> of, I know not what <HI>Glory,</HI> to de&s;ert them, could not &s;educe him to an <HI>Infamous Apo&s;ta&s;y.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> was notably calculated for THIS, above all Intentions; That a Glorious CHRIT may in the whole Sy&s;tem and Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> be duly Acknowledged, and have a due Homage paid unto Him. And he pre&s;&s;ed this Advice upon &s;ome Candidates of the Mini&s;try, with whom he was acquainted; <HI>Preach CHRIST, my Friend, Preach CHRIST, as

A Specimen <HI>This,</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Intellectual Powers</HI> in him, which if he had lived, would have anon brought him into the Number of the famous <HI>Gualterus</HI>'s and <HI>Waltherus</HI>'s, that make a Figure in the Ca|talogue of <HI>Literators.</HI> And yet, the&s;e <HI>Powers</HI> were always beautified and varni&s;hed with a con&s;picuous <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> in him, which cau&s;ed him to a&s;&s;ume unto him&s;elf no more, than if he had been, as <HI>Tertullian</HI> of old, (in imitation of the Apo&s;tles Elegancy, in his <HI>Elachi&s;toteros</HI>) elegant|ly called him&s;elf, <HI>Omnium Po&s;tremi&s;&s;imus.</HI></P>
<P>But that wherein I mo&s;t propo&s;e the Edifi|cation of the Survivors, is a &s;hort Account of the LAST HOURS that pa&s;&s;ed over him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thomas Gualterus Tabifico Morbo extinctus,</HI> mention'd by <HI>Bartholinus,</HI> he mu&s;t now be a Companion to. He lay many Months Langui&s;h|ing
<PB N="28" REF="002666_0018_0FE5FB51C65D45C0">of that <HI>Engli&s;h Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> a <HI>Con&s;umption:</HI> Where|in he over and over again went thorough that <HI>Process of Repentance,</HI> in which he made his ju&s;t Reflections on all the Errors of a <HI>Vain Youth,</HI> which a <HI>di&s;advantageou&s;ly Good Temper</HI> might have betray'd him to: Often &s;aying, <HI>I have been a wretched Fool; the greate&s;t Fool in the World!</HI> And he underwent the <HI>&s;aving Work</HI> of the Holy SPIRIT in <HI>Repetitions</HI> of it; Fir&s;t exceedingly <HI>Convincing</HI> and <HI>Aba&s;ing</HI> of him; then &s;hewing him the <HI>Remedy</HI> provided for him in a SAVI|OUR, and helping him to make his Flight un|to it; and cau&s;ing him thereupon to grow in his confirmed <HI>Re&s;olutions</HI> to live unto GOD.</P>
<P>The <HI>Repetitions</HI> of the&s;e Operations, did not hinder it, but that on the Day before he died, he had a Soul wonderfully di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with Fears of his Mi&s;carrying at the la&s;t: Saying, <HI>Oh! 'Tis a great Thing to Die!</HI>&mdash; Under the&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;es he importunately call'd for the In&s;tructions and A&s;&s;i&s;tances of <HI>One</HI> for whom he had &s;ome De|ference; Who, in Conjunction with his <HI>Father,</HI> again &s;et before him the <HI>Glorious Go&s;pel of the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD,</HI> which he had him&s;elf preached unto others. What pa&s;&s;ed &s;hall not be now re|lated; only one or two Pa&s;&s;ages it may not be ami&s;s to mention. When it was urged upon him; <Q>You have been a notable <HI>Di&s;putant</HI> in your Time; what they call a <HI>Logician:</HI> you have un|der&s;tood an <HI>Argument.</HI> I pray, what will you make of this <HI>Argument?</HI> The <HI>Propo&s;ition</HI> is; <HI>Our
<PB N="29" REF="002666_0018_0FE5FB51C65D45C0">Glorious LORD, the true Witness, who delivereth Souls, hath &s;olemnly declared, HIM THAT COMES UNTO ME, I WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT.</HI> Your <HI>A&s;&s;umption</HI> is; <HI>But I come unto Him; and heartily and earne&s;tly Beg of Him, and would Hope in Him, to do for me and on me, every thing that He does to them that come unto Him.</HI> Now the <HI>Conclu&s;ion;&mdash; Therefore I fear that He will not Receive me, but ca&s;t me off!</HI> Is this a Right <HI>Con|clu&s;ion?</HI> Did you u&s;e to Argue &s;o?</Q> His An&s;wer was, <HI>I find I have a Bu&s;y Adver&s;ary; And he would make this perver&s;e Conclu&s;ion for me!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>His Father then came upon his <HI>Unbelief</HI> with &s;uch victorious and overwhelming Remon&s;tran|ces; <Q>My dear Son, Were our SAVIOUR vi&s;i|bly here, as once in the Days of His Humilia|tion, and &s;hould you go pro&s;trate your &s;elf before Him, and be&s;eech of Him to have Com|pa&s;&s;ion on you, and give you an Heart to Love Him, can you imagine, that He would Reject you? Now, what a &s;trange thing is this <HI>Un|belief:</HI> to be di&s;couraged from <HI>That</HI> which car|ries an infinite Encouragement in it! As if His <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> or our <HI>Access</HI> to Him were the le&s;s for His being on the Throne of His <HI>Glory.</HI></Q> This al&s;o removed not the De&s;ponden|cies. But the Servants of GOD, (whereof there were more than <HI>Two or Three</HI>) in the Chamber, then joined in pouring out Supplications for him, That the <HI>Comforter</HI> who &s;hould <HI>relieve his Soul,</HI> might not be <HI>far from</HI> him; and that he
<PB N="30" REF="002666_0019_0FE5FB5356D3BC18">might be <HI>filled with Peace and Joy in Believing;</HI> and that he might <HI>fini&s;h well,</HI> and with &s;uch Tri|umphs over the <HI>La&s;t Enemy,</HI> as might Revive tho&s;e who were now praying for him, and en|tertain the People of GOD.</P>
<P>From <HI>This Hour</HI> (It was now Saturday-noon) <HI>Satisfactions</HI> and <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> continually grew up|on him.

He now longed for his <HI>Departure,</HI> to be <HI>with CHRIST.</HI> He kept &s;aying, (as his admired <HI>Calvin</HI> before him) <HI>How long, Lord, How long? Oh! Come quickly!</HI> And, <HI>Why is His Chariot &s;o long a coming; Why tarry the Wheels of His Chariot?</HI> But then, he asked, whether he <HI>did well,</HI> in <HI>longing</HI> &s;o much to be gone?</P>
<P>He &s;aid, <HI>I &s;hall be the mo&s;t Glorious In&s;tance of Sovereign Grace in all Heaven!</HI> And he added, <HI>I have no more to do here; but I &s;hall Serve and Glo|rify CHRIST to all Eternity!</HI> And then, <HI>Lord, Now lette&s;t thou thy Servant depart in Peace.</HI></P>
<P>He laid mighty Charges on &s;ome <HI>Young Per&s;ons</HI> that were near him; <Q>To fear GOD, and prize His CHRIST <HI>Betimes;</HI> and by no means to de|lay <HI>Repentance</HI> one Day longer: For the longer they delay'd it, the more Backward they would
<PB N="31" REF="002666_0019_0FE5FB5356D3BC18">find them&s;elves unto it. <HI>He &s;aid;</HI> They might think, that for them to engage in the Ways of PIETY, would be to abandon all Joy and Plea&s;ure; but this is a great Mi&s;take: Let them try the Practice of it, and it will never be Re|pented of.</Q></P>
<P>When the Morning of the <HI>Lords Day</HI> [Jan. 10.] arrived, he expre&s;&s;ed an Expectation, that He &s;hould be <HI>That Day in Paradi&s;e.</HI> His Father told him, <Q>I am going to the <HI>Hou&s;e of GOD,</HI> which is the <HI>Gate of Heaven;</HI> but I hope, You are go|ing to <HI>Heaven it &s;elf,</HI> to join with the <HI>A&s;&s;embly Above.</HI></Q> He replied, O! <HI>I love that Glorious Church!</HI> His Father added, <Q>I am going al&s;o to the <HI>Ta|ble</HI> of the Lord; but I hope, You are going to <HI>Drink of the Fruit of the Vine New</HI> with CHRIST in the <HI>Kingdom of his Father.</HI></Q> He replied, <HI>O! And without Price!</HI> At Noon, his Father going to the Afternoon Service, and &s;uppo&s;ing that he &s;hould not (as he <HI>did not</HI>) &s;ee him any more, took his Farewel of him, in tho&s;e Words; <HI>My Child, The Lord JESUS receive thy Spirit.</HI> The <HI>Echo</HI> from him to it was,&mdash; <HI>And the Lord fit it for His Re|ception!</HI> He continued in Heaven-ward A&s;pira|tions, till towards the clo&s;e of the Afternoon|Service, when he fell a &s;miling: And one asking him the Rea&s;on of it, he only made an <HI>Unintel|ligible</HI> An&s;wer, which intimated as if an <HI>admira|ble Con&s;ort,</HI> in <HI>Singing</HI> the Prai&s;es of his Re|deemer now entertained him.
