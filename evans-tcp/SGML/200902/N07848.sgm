<HEAD>A Defence of the Halifax Letter, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE editor of the Halifax letter hath, with much &s;erenity and compo&s;ure, attended to the illiberal oppo&s;ition, and multiplied abu&s;e, which he and that pamphlet have received, from various quarters. He was willing to wait the la&s;t efforts of his malignant adver&s;aries, before he attempted a reply. Their rage, at length, &s;eems to be near &s;pent, and the troubled &s;ea of controver&s;y hath again almo&s;t &s;ub&s;ided. He therefore ventures, once more, to embark upon it; and is de&s;irous, for his own ho|nour, as well as for the example of his antagoni&s;ts, to conduct him&s;elf with all po&s;&s;ible decency and mo|deration. Thus, when a calm &s;ucceeds a &s;torm, we revolve in our minds the pa&s;t tumult, and cooly &s;ur|vey the confu&s;ion it occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>In order to ju&s;tify the Halifax gentleman's letter, it is nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e, that Great-Britain, during the late war, had lavi&s;hed the blood of her &s;ubjects, and &s;pent immen&s;e &s;ums, as well for the &s;ecurity of the colonies, as her own importance and dignity. A few years ago, when O&s;wego and fort William-Henry were taken, no one can forget, that the&s;e colonies
<PB N="4" REF="010012_0003_0F7B985042DCFC88">
were &s;o terrified and alarmed, that they would gladly have con&s;ented to have made even Albany the bar|rier, between the French and them: But, through the &s;miles of heaven, and the unanimity and bravery of the Briti&s;h councils and arms, the enemy were at la&s;t brought to terms, and the colonies &s;ecured, and made happy by a peace. The government, in pur&s;uing &s;uch mea&s;ures as it thought nece&s;&s;ary, to pre&s;erve the colo|nies from future inva&s;ions and attacks, became obliged to keep up a large body of troops, cantoned in dif|different parts of the continent. Already plunged in debt, to almo&s;t an incredible amount, and availing it&s;elf of every expedient, however burden&s;ome, to rai&s;e &s;upplies from its di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects in Great-Britain; it was judged rea&s;onable and equitable to draw &s;ome advantages from the trade of its colonies, in order to rai&s;e a fund for the maintenance and &s;upport of tho&s;e troops, thus employed for our protection. An act of parliament, levying &s;ome impo&s;itions, was made; and we were given to under&s;tand, that the mini&s;try were meditating &s;uch further taxes as the exigence of things might require, and &s;uch as might, at the &s;ame time, be lea&s;t burden&s;ome to us: Neverthele&s;s, here it was, a di&s;content fir&s;t began to appear, and the con|duct of the admini&s;tration was arraigned, by many, with all the petulance of children, who, by long in|dulgence, become impatient of the &s;malle&s;t re&s;traints.</P>
<P>From cen&s;uring the act of parliament, as u&s;ele&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ive, the humour afterwards took a diffe|rent turn; and we were &s;oon told by many, that the parliament of Great-Britain had no con&s;titutional right, no authority, <HI>de jure,</HI> as &s;ome expre&s;&s;ed it, to bind us by any act of their making, becau&s;e we were not re|pre&s;ented.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="010012_0004_0F7B9850F17B82D0">Ignorance and conceit fir&s;t promulged this doctrine; and as it flattered the pride and &s;elf-love of the peo|ple, it is no wonder its progre&s;s hath been &s;o rapid and &s;ucce&s;sful. To &s;pread the folly and mi&s;chief &s;till more, numberle&s;s pamphlets and pieces in news-papers were publi&s;hed, in which the parent country and its admini&s;tration have been treated in the mo&s;t contu|melious and irreverent manner.</P>
<P>As the editor hath been charged with fal&s;hood and mi&s;repre&s;entation in the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, he here begs leave, in the fir&s;t place, to bring together, in one view, &s;everal extracts from the&s;e pamphlets and news-papers alluded to, that the public may judge for them&s;elves, whether his a&s;&s;ertions are well founded.</P>
<P>In a Providence news-paper of Augu&s;t 18, 1764, Great-Britain is treated with the greate&s;t mockery and deri&s;ion; and in the &s;tile and manner of a fanatick exhorter, the writer begins with this text: "In St. JAMES's, you will find the&s;e words, MOTHER COUN|TRY." In the cour&s;e of this exhortation, the preacher names a certain nobleman of the board of trade, that, a few years ago, (he &s;ays) enquired "if New-England was an i&s;land." This is a low, &s;candalous, legendary tale, purpo&s;ely invented to bring contempt and odium upon the admini&s;tration. He &s;ays, <Q>It mu&s;t look like a direct de&s;ign of <HI>en&s;laving</HI> us, to talk of the infinite obligation and debt, we are under to Old-England, for pro&s;ecuting a war here; and how &s;ub&s;ervient we ought to be to particular intere&s;ts in Britain, in con&s;ideration thereof. When <HI>certain de&s;igns</HI> are to be an&s;wered, <HI>dark words and phra&s;es</HI> &s;uit be&s;t, which really, without &s;en&s;e or meaning, if properly &s;ounded and echoed, become &s;acred, and effectual machines for bringing about the purpo&s;e,</Q>
<PB N="6" REF="010012_0005_0F7B98522E679BB0">
i. e. to en&s;lave the colonies. Again, <Q>Hath the govern|ment of England been at any expence in &s;upport|ing the colonies of New-England? No. Is one farthing balance due to them, in the whole ac|count, from the fir&s;t planting of New-England, to this time? No.</Q>&mdash;The tendency of all this, is manife&s;tly to degrade the mother country, to rai&s;e &s;u&s;picions and jealou&s;ies again&s;t her, and to blot out of the colonies every trace of duty and gratitude.&mdash; Again he &s;ays, he <Q>could mention many in&s;tances of trea&s;ons and rebellions in a certain mother coun|try.</Q> It &s;eems a general opinion here, that there can be no rebellion unle&s;s the pretender is concerned in it.&mdash;Again he &s;ays, <Q>the late acts, clogging our trade, are unnatural, highly injurious, and not very motherly. The northern colonies have been mo&s;t infamou&s;ly belied, &s;candalized, and injuriou&s;ly treat|ed, by a number of ignorant and envious officers in the army and navy,</Q> &amp;c.&mdash;What rea&s;on can there po&s;&s;ibly be, that &s;hould make the gentlemen of the army or navy envious again&s;t the colonies? The &s;lander again&s;t them is groundle&s;s and malicious. <HI>In|gratitude, more &s;trong than traytors arms,</HI> hath &s;wal|lowed up all remembrance of their &s;ervices. Such are the breathings of our piety to tho&s;e who have bled for our deliverance.</P>
<P>The Bo&s;ton gazette of the 24th September, 1764, contains a publication, in which are the&s;e words: <Q>I know not what wi&s;e mea&s;ures Mr. Gr&mdash;nv&mdash;l's political genius may &s;ugge&s;t, for the benefit of the colonies; but I would fain whi&s;per in his ear, that there are millions of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in America, who have a warm &s;en&s;e of liberty: Many of them have as much under&s;tanding as he him&s;elf has, and
<PB N="7" REF="010012_0006_0F7B9852A0706D98">
have acquired as thorough a knowledge of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and the rights of Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects, as he. They &s;mile at the <HI>folly</HI> and <HI>non&s;en&s;e</HI> of him and others, who fancy that American &s;ub|jects are not intitled to all the rights of native Bri|tons. They have never forfeited tho&s;e rights; and therefore cannot, nay, they <HI>will not,</HI> con&s;ent to part with them.</Q> Mr. Grenville, here maliciou&s;ly pointed at, is at the head of the trea&s;ury; and, to his vigilance and great merit, the nation is much in|debted ever &s;ince he pre&s;ided there: Yet he is charged with <HI>folly</HI> and <HI>non&s;en&s;e,</HI> in expre&s;s words; and the mother country is &s;et at defiance, for the colonies <HI>will not,</HI> &s;ays the author, con&s;ent to part with their rights. Such language as this, from inhabitants of dependant colonies to the &s;uperior and &s;overeign head, is froward, peremptory, and ho&s;tile.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The paper here cited, was cen&s;ured by the pre&s;ent <HI>Providence writer,</HI> in the Providence gazette of October 6, 1764, a little while before his apo&s;tacy.</NOTE></P>
<P>A pamphlet entitled, "the &s;entiments of a Briti&s;h North-American," publi&s;hed at Bo&s;ton, &s;ome time pa&s;t, has the following motto in the title page, taken from Phaedrus's fables.</P>
<Q><L>A&s;ellum in prato timidus pa&s;cebat &s;enex,</L>
<L>Is ho&s;tium clamore &s;ubito territus</L>
<L>Suadebat a&s;ino fugere ne po&s;&s;int capi</L>
<L>At ille lentus. Quae&s;o num binas mihi</L>
<L>Clitellas impo&s;iturum victorem putas?</L>
<L>Senex negavit; ergo quid refert mea</L>
<L>Cui &s;erviam, clitellas dum portem meas.</L></Q>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of this pamphlet, was to arraign the mea&s;ures of the admini&s;tration, relative to
<PB N="8" REF="010012_0007_0F7B98532F179E48">
taxing the colonies, &amp;c. The application of the above fable to that &s;ubject, &s;hews clearly the author's opinion, that under the pre&s;ent parliamentary regula|tions, it is a matter of indifference what prince or power we are &s;ubject to, whether a GEORGE or a LEWIS, as a certain gentleman expre&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>In the Providence gazette, November 10, 1764, is contained, &s;omething that is called a dream. The dreamer before he falls a&s;leep, introduces him&s;elf in this manner: <Q>He that acknowleges that I am an Engli&s;hman, and tells me, at the &s;ame time, that I am to live under laws, which I have no hand in making, and am to be taxed where I have no repre&s;entative, does but mock me.</Q> In the mid&s;t of his Dream, &s;peaking of the &s;tamp duty, intended to be laid on the colonies, he compares it to the branding of bea&s;ts. The performance is &s;omething of the dra|matick kind; and among the per&s;ons of the drama, is a ma&s;ter brander and his retinue,. Who this cha|racter means, the reader mu&s;t di&s;cover. In the &s;ame &s;cene is al&s;o exhibited, a ragged country fellow, grin|ning. The dreamer &s;ays, <Q>The ma&s;ter brander, with his retinue, approached the pa&s;ture with great pomp, one carrring a large &s;ilver brand, in the form of the letter S; and upon entering the field, they began with the a&s;&s;es, and branded them without interruption.</Q> Soon after he adds, <Q>A very rag|ged country fellow &s;aid, with a facetious grin, that he always under&s;tood till then, that the good peo|ple of England very well knew, that none but a&s;&s;es would &s;tand &s;till to be branded.</Q> The meaning, wrapped up in this low, vulgar allegory, is plain.&mdash; The letter S, denotes the <HI>Slavery</HI> the colonies would be &s;ubjected to by the &s;tamp duty, if they, like a&s;&s;es,
<PB N="9" REF="010012_0008_0F7B98575FB74340">
&s;hould &s;ubmit to it.&mdash;The ragged country fellow de|notes the dreamer him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A piece in the New-York gazette, of Thur&s;day, March 7th, 1765, which came in the editor's way, while the&s;e &s;heets were compiling, furni&s;hes him with a recent and palpable in&s;tance of that unfilial di&s;po|&s;ition too prevalent in the colonies. The author of this piece fir&s;t endeavours to rai&s;e a cry again&s;t the Halifax letter, and then, exalting the rights and privi|leges of the colonies, he &s;ays, <Q>If tho&s;e rights and privileges are violated, what rea&s;on then can re|main, why they &s;hould prefer the Briti&s;h to the French <HI>government,</HI> or any other? They may, indeed, from their pre&s;ent weakne&s;s, be compelled to &s;ub|mit to the impo&s;itions of mini&s;terial power, but they will certainly con&s;ider that power as ty|rannical; they will hate and abhor it, <HI>and, as &s;oon as they are able, will throw it off, or perhaps try to obtain better terms from &s;ome other power.</HI></Q> Here is an hone&s;t, plain &s;poken gentleman, that does not mince the matter at all; he roundly threatens Great-Britain with the defection of her colonies, <HI>as &s;oon as they are able.</HI></P>
<P>To give the la&s;t fini&s;hings to the opinions and dog|ma's contained in the aforegoing extracts, and many others which might be produced, of the &s;ame &s;ort, his honour the governor of Rhode-I&s;land colony, en|tered upon the &s;tage,
<Q><L>Mid the low murmurs of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive fear,</L>
<L>And mingled rage, my H&mdash; rais'd his Voice;</L></Q>
and in a &s;olemn, argumentative manner, a&s;&s;umed upon him&s;elf to prove, that an act of parliament can|not levy taxes on the colonies, by any other authority,
<PB N="10" REF="010012_0009_0F7B9857E067F988">
but that of mere &s;uperiority and power. (See page 20 of "rights of colonies examined.") Be&s;ides the boldne&s;s of &s;uch a po&s;ition, the performance appeared throughout o&s;tentations, in the manner and execution; and in the matter, di&s;re&s;pectful and unthankful to the mother country. The many quotations, from ancient and modern books, abundantly evince the fir&s;t. The latter &s;hall now be proved, by one or two ob&s;ervations upon it, which were omitted in the Halifax letter.</P>
<P>In page 20, his honour &s;ays, <Q>In the year 1746, when Duke D'Anville came out from France, with the mo&s;t formidable French fleet that ever was in the American &s;eas, enraged at the&s;e colonies for the lo&s;s of Loui&s;bourg the year before, and with orders to make an attack on them; even in this greate&s;t exigence, the&s;e colonies were left to the protection of heaven and their own efforts.</Q> This in&s;inuation is ungrateful and di&s;re&s;pectful. The ad|mini&s;tration at that time, it is confe&s;&s;ed, was inactive and indolent, and the Briti&s;h honour and intere&s;t alike neglected in all places; but the malevolence, in the manner of the expre&s;&s;ion, is obvious; and the idea intended to be produced, is, that the colonies were particularly &s;acrificed by Great-Britain at that time, for, &s;ays he, <Q>they were left to the protection of heaven and their own efforts.</Q> What other purpo&s;e can this effect, but to impre&s;s the people with an opinion, that they were at that time neglected by their mother country? What other pa&s;&s;ions will it kindle, but re&s;entment again&s;t her? What more pow|erful argument can be u&s;ed to withdraw the &s;ubjection of the colonies from Great-Britain, than to fill the minds of the people with doubts and di&s;tru&s;ts of
<PB N="11" REF="010012_0010_0F7B9858B5E921D8">
that care and protection they might rea&s;onably expect from her? But further, the Duke D'Anville was enraged at <HI>the&s;e colonies</HI> for the lo&s;s of Loui&s;bourg; as if <HI>the&s;e colonies</HI> alone were the &s;ole in&s;truments of its reduction. The truth is, without depreciating the &s;ervices of the Americans, the conque&s;t of that place was, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to the &s;quadron under Admiral Warren, without which, it's more than pro|bable, it never would have been taken. But this pa&s;&s;age of his honour's book, is &s;till further reprehen|&s;ible, for its di&s;ingenuity and concealment of the truth. Great-Britain is charged with neglecting the colonies, but not a word is &s;aid of the parliamentary reimbur&s;e|ment of the whole charges of that expedition.</P>
<P>In page 15, his honour, after cen&s;uring the enlarged power of the admiralty, and impeaching the integrity of the judge, makes the following reflection: <Q>Such unbounded protection and encouragement given to informers, mu&s;t call to every one's remembrance Tacitus's account of the mi&s;erable condition of the Romans, in the reign of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> their emperor, who let loo&s;e and encouraged the informers of that age.</Q> Here, the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures, contrived by the government, to &s;uppre&s;s the infamous practice of &s;muggling, is called, an unbounded protection and encouragement given to informers; and the pre&s;ent mo&s;t happy &s;tate of the Briti&s;h nation, under a prince who is the delight of mankind, is a&s;&s;ociated with, and likened unto, the mi&s;erable condition of the Romans under <HI>Tiberius,</HI> one of the mo&s;t wicked and voluptu|ous of their emperors. The&s;e are not the effu&s;ions of a peaceable citizen, or a faithful magi&s;trate; and the editor unfeignedly regrets the occa&s;ion, which has pro|duced this remark, becau&s;e he hoped never to have
<PB N="12" REF="010012_0011_0F7B985933B2B5F0">
&s;een &s;o great a &s;acrifice made, by the honourable au|thor, to popular favour. But, ala&s;s! the foul path to popularity, mu&s;t ever be &s;trewed with the &s;poils ra|vi&s;hed from the brow of royalty.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks &s;ufficiently prove the charge of di&s;re&s;pect to the mother country, in his honour's book; which, together with the pamphlets and news-papers afore-recited, will &s;trongly mark the complection of too many in the colonies, when the Halifax letter made its appearance. The editor, truly &s;candalized at &s;uch freedoms, and fully &s;en&s;ible of the bad con&s;e|quences which would follow the increa&s;e of this temper, which he hath now clearly expo&s;ed to view, ventured to publi&s;h that letter. He fore&s;aw it would be unpopular, and draw on him a profu&s;ion of obloquy and reproach; and the event is conformable to his expectations: but &s;till he is not di&s;mayed, and he will per&s;evere, with unremiting zeal, till time, which will produce his be&s;t vindication, &s;hall con|vince his adver&s;aries of their errors and mi&s;takes. Perhaps there never was an in&s;tance of &s;o great a pro&s;titution, and deba&s;ement of the human faculties, as in the conduct of tho&s;e who have appeared in this controver&s;y again&s;t the Halifax letter. A man might have committed bla&s;phemy and trea&s;on, and met with more humane treatment than has been &s;hewn the author, as appears by the Bo&s;ton pamphlet, and many detached pieces in news-papers, publi&s;hed again&s;t him. To apologize for Great-Britain, it &s;eems, is the only unpardonable &s;in in this meridian. The bitterne&s;s of truth is very offen&s;ive, and the Halifax letter has dared to &s;peak it out. Had the matters therein contained, been de&s;titute of truth, it would have been treated like the lie of a day, and as &s;oon
<PB N="13" REF="010012_0012_0F7B9859F5E466E8">
di&s;appeared; but the rage and venom thrown out again&s;t it, is an unerring proof of its merit, and the authors mo&s;t honorable te&s;timony. The following points were all the Halifax letter intended to prove, <HI>to wit:</HI></P>
<P>That the New-England colonies privileges, as cor|porations created by the crown, are fixed and a&s;cer|tained by their charters.</P>
<P>That the&s;e charters give them no exemption from the juri&s;diction of parliament.</P>
<P>That no grant of the king could exempt them from this juri&s;diction, becau&s;e the common law, out of which it is derived, confe&s;&s;edly reaches the colonies, and brings with it that juri&s;diction, and announces its force and operation over them.</P>
<P>That the hou&s;e of commons con&s;ider them&s;elves as repre&s;entatives of every Briti&s;h &s;ubject, wherever he be; and therefore to every u&s;eful and beneficial purpo&s;e, the intere&s;ts of the coloni&s;ts are as well &s;ecured and managed by &s;uch a hou&s;e, as if they had a &s;hare in electing them.</P>
<P>That the late act for regulating trade, &amp;c. is founded upon the nece&s;&s;ities of the admini&s;tration, which mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have adopted the be&s;t methods it could, to rai&s;e tho&s;e monies intended to be applied for the protection of the colonies. And,</P>
<P>That the employment of cutters, and enlarging the power of the admiralty, can be accounted for no otherwi&s;e, than from the apprehen&s;ion of the legi&s;la|ture, that &s;muggling, in &s;ome of the colonies, required further and &s;everer remedies.</P>
<P>This was the whole purport and de&s;ign of the Halifax letter: If any &s;atyr or ridicule, again&s;t the author of <HI>the rights of colonies,</HI> was occa&s;ionally in|ter&s;per&s;ed,
<PB N="14" REF="010012_0013_0F7B985B69569C70">
it was fairly and ju&s;tly invited, by the vanity of an attempt, which was no le&s;s than to anni|hilate the parliamentary juri&s;diction in the colonies.</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition to this inoffen&s;ive pamphlet, the editor of it is a&s;&s;ailed by two very di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;onages; both of them e&s;teemed the exacte&s;t models of polite|ne&s;s, urbanity, and &s;oftne&s;s of manners, perhaps in America. The fir&s;t retailed his labours in the Provi|dence news-papers. The &s;econd has fabricated a pamphlet of thirty-two pages, printed at Bo&s;ton. They &s;hall, in the few following remarks, be called, for brevity's &s;ake, the <HI>Providence writer,</HI> and the <HI>Bo&s;ton writer.</HI> The <HI>Providence writer</HI> &s;hall be fir&s;t taken notice of.</P>
<P>He accu&s;es the Halifax gentleman of want of can|dor, for charging the honourable author with main|taining, <Q>that the colonies have rights independant of parliament.</Q> So far from retracting the charge, the editor doth now aver, that this dogma hath been a&s;&s;erted by his honour in the mo&s;t open and expre&s;s manner. It can be proved, even from public files and records, that the parliamentary authority hath been ludicrou&s;ly treated by him. He and his followers, now unable to mantain the doctrine, upon any prin|ciples, founded either upon the nature of government, common &s;en&s;e, or prudence, are at length become a&s;hamed of their indi&s;cretion, and have no means of acquittal, but to deny, with confidence, that they ever maintained it. The editor, however, continues his accu&s;ation, upon the expre&s;&s;ion of his honour's book alone, without availing him&s;elf of any foreign aid; but he confe&s;&s;es, it will be difficult to convince the <HI>Providence writer</HI> of this, till the meaning of words &s;hall be adju&s;ted by &s;ome authority, to which his obe|dience
<PB N="15" REF="010012_0014_0F7B985B709C84E0">
may be exacted. To what purpo&s;e will it be to make u&s;e of &s;igns, if their &s;ignification may be twi&s;ted and varied ju&s;t as a writer plea&s;es? Does not his honour &s;ay, in plain Engli&s;h words, that <HI>the common people of Great-Britain have not any &s;ort of power over the Ame|ricans, and that they cannot give a power to their repre&s;entatives which they have not them&s;elves.</HI> Is not the inference from the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions as clear as the &s;un, that <HI>the&s;e repre&s;entatives have no power over the Ame|ricans?</HI> And if the repre&s;entatives, i. e. the hou&s;e of commons, have no power over the Americans, an act of parliament can have no power over them, for the hou&s;e of commons is a con&s;tituent branch of the legi&s;lative, and their concurrence ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to the making of every act: Yet the <HI>Providence writer,</HI> with the mo&s;t inexcu&s;eable prevarication, would fain melt down this plain, &s;triking denial of parliamentary juri&s;diction, to mean no more than this, <HI>that it was his honour's belief, that according to Briti&s;h principles of government, the &s;ubjects of America ought not to be taxed in parliament.</HI> This rude and violent perver&s;ion of plain Engli&s;h, cannot deceive any body that will con&s;ider but a moment.</P>
<P>The editor thinks this a proper place to thank the <HI>Bo&s;ton writer</HI> for a little a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In page 5 of his book, he <Q>confe&s;&s;es and laments that the aforegoing expre&s;&s;ions of his honour involve a &s;ophi&s;m, un|worthy of him;</Q> and to do the <HI>Bo&s;ton writer</HI> ju&s;tice he has detected the fallacy which e&s;caped the Halifax gentleman. His honour, however, may not take it &s;o kindly, and will begin to &s;u&s;pect, that he is in perils from fal&s;e brethren; for certainly, the <HI>Bo&s;ton writer</HI> has given a &s;pecimen of his di&s;ingenuity, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it. Every body mu&s;t allow this is acting a
<PB N="16" REF="010012_0015_0F7B985C32618D70">
double, in&s;incere part. A friend &s;hould rather have concealed the fault, than expo&s;ed it: But the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Bo&s;ton writer</HI> totally ab&s;orbs him; and the cau&s;e it&s;elf is rather to be &s;acrificed, than a &s;ingle ray of his &s;uperior di&s;cernment &s;hould be eclip&s;ed.&mdash; He is, however, entitled to a further compliment from the editor, for he allows his honour's expre&s;&s;ion to be an implicit denial of the authority of parliament, which is the &s;ame, in &s;ub&s;tance, as an explicit one; and the editor can &s;ee no difference in the two modes, except in the di&s;gui&s;e and cunning, which are, by no means, the talents of a fair and candid enquirer after truth. Here, it is hoped, that, with the reinforcement of the <HI>Bo&s;ton writer,</HI> the reader will be convinced that the charge upon his honour is fully made out.</P>
<P>But &s;hould it be &s;till thought, that his honour has not expre&s;ly denied the juri&s;diction of parliament, yet the tendency of his pamphlet will be found equally mi&s;chievous. <Q>If we are taxed, (&s;ays he) without our own con&s;ent; we are in the mi&s;erable condition of &s;laves.</Q> Page 4. In this place, he hath combined together the idea of &s;lavery, with that of being taxed without our con&s;ent, which is very artful, and an effectu|al way to extingui&s;h all regard to acts of parliament.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, from the &s;lighte&s;t knowledge of the temper and genius of a free people, as the Engli&s;h are, that whenever they are made to believe, that the authority, which takes money out of their pur&s;es, is not founded in <HI>equity,</HI> they will &s;oon refu&s;e obedience to it. And, therefore, &s;uppo&s;ing all that has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject, by his honour, or any other, to have gone no further, than only to que&s;tion the <HI>equity</HI> of taxing the colonies without their being repre&s;ented; the effect of &s;uch rea&s;oning, upon the minds of the
<PB N="17" REF="010012_0016_0F7B985FC25BF930">
people, will be equally as dangerous to the peace and order of government, as a downright denial of the authority of parliament would be. So that it is a poor eva&s;ion for the patrons and promoters of &s;uch doctrines, to &s;ay, they only humbly call in que&s;tion the <HI>equity</HI> of exerci&s;ing the parliamentary juri&s;diction; or, that according to Briti&s;h principles of government, the Americans ought not to be taxed in parliament; for the morality of any action is determined by its con&s;equences: And if &s;uch opinions, however dre&s;&s;ed up, will be found to have weakened the ties of obedi|ence, the mi&s;chief is great; and the guilt of it will fall upon the heads of tho&s;e who have promoted &s;uch opinions.</P>
<P>The Halifax gentleman &s;ays, <Q>that he had endea|voured to inve&s;tigate the natural relation, between the colonies and the mother &s;tate, ab&s;tracted from compact.</Q> The <HI>Providence writer,</HI> remarkable for the cleanline&s;s of his ideas, &s;ays, this is <HI>rank non&s;en&s;e;</HI> that the mother country and colony have no natural relation. The editor could, on this occa&s;ion, add a <HI>modicum</HI> to the <HI>Providence writer</HI>'s &s;tock of know|lege, by various extracts from books, and thereby ju&s;tify the mode of expre&s;&s;ion in the Halifax letter: But he is relieved from further elucidating this point, by the <HI>Bo&s;ton writer,</HI> to whom he again pays his com|pliment of thanks, for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in transferring to the <HI>Providence writer,</HI> the <HI>rank non&s;en&s;e</HI> charged upon the Halifax gentleman. In page 31, the <HI>Bo&s;ton writer</HI> has &s;hewn, that there is a natural relation between a mother &s;tate and its colonies; &s;o that the Halifax letter is fairly quit of the ab&s;urdity, by a majority of two voices again&s;t one: But &s;hould it be thought otherwi&s;e, the editor leaves the point to be
<PB N="18" REF="010012_0017_0F7B986049B7B778">
decided between them. The policy, in the oppo&s;ition to the Halifax letter, mu&s;t appear new and &s;ingular. The <HI>amiable couple,</HI> who form this oppo&s;ition, in&s;tead of being united, counteract each other; and, like the legs of Nebuchadnezzar's image, compo&s;ed of iron and clay, will &s;oon break to pieces.</P>
<P>The Halifax gentleman &s;ays, "that acts of parlia|ment derive their authority from the common law." "If &s;o, &s;ays the <HI>Providence writer,</HI> the juri&s;diction of parliament <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;ubordinate to the common law." Not &s;o neither: And the i&s;&s;ue of &s;tupidity &s;hall be fairly tried. Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> &s;ays, indeed, right, that the juri&s;diction of this court is tran&s;cendant, &amp;c. But from whence is it derived? Could this juri&s;diction form and create it&s;elf? No: It is the common law, founded upon long u&s;age and con&s;ent, which has placed an uncontroulable, tran&s;cendant juri&s;diction in that court, even to alter and amend the cour&s;e and direction of various branches of the common law it&s;elf. If the <HI>Providence writer</HI> could trace a different &s;ource of this juri&s;diction, or account for it better, he ought to have done it; but his &s;ilence is a proof that he could not.</P>
<P>He charges the Halifax gentleman with unbounded folly, and then makes him &s;ay, that parliamentary juri&s;diction <Q>can be extended, occa&s;ionally, into every kingdom of the world.</Q> But there is no expre&s;&s;ion in the letter that will warrant any &s;uch con&s;truction. It &s;ays, <Q>The juri&s;diction of parliament is attached to every Briti&s;h &s;ubject, where&s;oever he be.</Q> And this is, indeed, true of all &s;ubjects in the Briti&s;h colo|nies. It is there, this juri&s;diction is now di&s;puted; and they at pre&s;ent are the &s;ubject of this controver&s;y. Therefore, the general expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>where&s;oever he be,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="010012_0018_0F7B98618FB4CC38">
according to the rules of argumentation, mu&s;t mean, and be interpreted, <HI>in the colonies.</HI> Lord Coke &s;ays, <Q>The common law extends to all places granted under the broad &s;eal.</Q> Therefore it nece&s;&s;arily extends to, and operates in, the colonies. It there maintains and a&s;&s;erts the juri&s;diction of parliament over them. Shall the editor be &s;till a&s;ked for a better, or &s;tronger authority, to ju&s;tify his opinion?</P>
<P>In one paragraph of the Providence news-paper, the Halifax gentleman is twice charged with <HI>impudence,</HI> with the <HI>mo&s;t aggre&s;&s;ing impudence.</HI> This is indeed very clever; and what is it for? Why he has pre&s;u|med to &s;ay, "that a repre&s;entation, if allowed, would be of no real u&s;e to us." Is this &s;o criminal? Have patience, gentle reader, and be not a&s;toni&s;hed at the editor's calmne&s;s. Michael, the arch-angel, would not bring a railing accu&s;ation again&s;t the Devil.&mdash; Bitter words, and opprobrious epithets, are harmle&s;s things, and prove nothing. It is the &s;ocial and moral conduct of a man, that forms his character in life. The meane&s;t wretches are the mo&s;t dextrous at all the artillery of low abu&s;e; and to excel in this re|&s;pect, is only to &s;ink in fame.</P>
<P>The Halifax gentleman &s;ays, <Q>It is the opinion of the hou&s;e of commons, and may be con&s;idered as a law of parliament, that they are the repre&s;en|tatives of every Briti&s;h &s;ubject, wherever he be.</Q> In &s;aying this, his intention was merely to conciliate the minds of his countrymen, and to produce in the colonies a quiet &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the mea&s;ures of parlia|ment, by letting them know, that they have no rea&s;on to complain, becau&s;e, in the opinion of the hou&s;e of commons, tho' they are not in fact repre&s;ented, yet their properties and intere&s;ts are equally regarded
<PB N="20" REF="010012_0019_0F7B986237ED13E0">
with tho&s;e of their fellow &s;ubjects in Great-Britain. But it &s;eems this prudent and commendable endea|vour of the Halifax letter, meets with the u&s;ual per|&s;onal invective from the <HI>Providence writer.</HI> Mu&s;t not he, and his whole tribe, &s;tand condemned, in the judgment of all &s;ober and moderate men, for wickedly mi&s;leading the people, under the deceitful gui&s;e of liberty? Is not he a better friend to the colonies, who tells them the plain truth, and would fain pre|vent the increa&s;e of tho&s;e prejudices and idols of the mind, which, if &s;uffered to grow wild, will infalliably be hurtful to the pre&s;ent age, and to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The Halifax letter &s;ays, <Q>that a merchant, tho' worth &pound;.100,000 &s;terling, if it con&s;i&s;ts only in per&s;onal effects, has no vote in election of parlia|ment members.</Q> The <HI>Providence writer</HI> &s;ays, <HI>it is fal&s;e.</HI> To prove that it is fal&s;e, he cites ju&s;tice Powys's argument, in the ca&s;e of <HI>A&s;hby</HI> and <HI>White,</HI> who &s;ays, <Q>In &s;ome boroughs, every potwaller may vote; in &s;ome, re&s;idents; and in others, the out|lying burge&s;&s;es, &amp;c.</Q> What then? Does this prove it fal&s;e? A man may be worth &pound;. 100,000 &s;ter|ling, per&s;onal e&s;tate, and yet be neither a freeholder, a burge&s;s, a potwaller, or a freeman, of any corpora|tion in Great-Britain; and therefore may have no right to vote. So that it remains yet undeniably plain, that a man of that fortune may be unqualified to vote; and it is undoubtedly true, that there are many &s;uch in Great-Britain, who cannot vote at all. But the matter is &s;carcely worth the writing of a &s;ingle word, and &s;hould here have been unnoticed, had it not been for the charge of fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>The Halifax letter affirms, <Q>that copyholders in England, of &pound;. 1000 &s;terling per annum, cannot
<PB N="21" REF="010012_0020_0F7B9863070C42A0">
vote.</Q> Here the <HI>Providence writer</HI> gives him the lie again.&mdash;Thou parragon of truth and goodne&s;s, does it follow, that becau&s;e the &s;tatute of the 9th of Anne qualifies a copyholder for life, of &pound;. 600 &s;terling per annum, to be a knight of the &s;hire, that therefore copyholders may vote? It clearly does not. "Copy|holders are a &s;ervile tenure: They are not free and common &s;ocage; and therefore fall &s;hort of the dig|nity, the immunities, and the independency of that freehold tenure, which, for more than three hundred years, have con&s;tituted an elector of knight of the &s;hire." This doctrine was fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, by a very learned man, with whom the <HI>Providence writer</HI> is not yet acquainted; and it was confirmed by the &s;tatute of the 31&s;t of the late king, which enacted, "That after the 29th day of June, A. D. 1758, no copyholder &s;hould vote for a knight of the &s;hire, under penalty of &pound;. 50 &s;terling," &amp;c.&mdash;The le&s;&s;on of humiliation is hard to learn; but painful as it is, the <HI>Providence writer</HI> &s;hould here begin the work: And, for his encouragement, let him remember that his credit will rai&s;e in proportion to the decrea&s;e of his pride; and that meekne&s;s will re&s;tore to him, what he has lo&s;t by his arrogance.</P>
<P>The employment of cutters, and enlarging the power of the admiralty, contained in the act of par|liament, was complained of by the honourable author. As the&s;e mea&s;ures &s;eemed grievous to the coloni&s;ts, the Halifax gentleman conceived, that if he could give any &s;atisfactory account of the motives, which induced the admini&s;tration to adopt them, it would not be unacceptable to &s;uch per&s;ons as had not con|&s;idered of the matter, and would rather &s;often the coloni&s;ts, than provoke them again&s;t tho&s;e mea&s;ures:
<PB N="22" REF="010012_0021_0F7B9863DE9E1AB0">
Accordingly he re&s;olved the cau&s;es of the new regu|lations, into the nece&s;&s;ity of the thing. In all &s;tates, puni&s;hments mu&s;t ri&s;e in proportion to offences. The more flagrant <HI>the&s;e</HI> are, the more &s;evere &s;hould <HI>tho&s;e</HI> be. This will be admitted by every body. <HI>Corrup|ti&s;&s;ima re&s;publica, plurimae leges,</HI> &s;ays Tacitus. But it &s;eems the <HI>Providence writer</HI> thinks the&s;e proceedings arbitrary and u&s;ele&s;s, becau&s;e, he &s;ays, "there has been, for years pa&s;t, little or no &s;muggling carried on in the&s;e northern colonies, but in the article of me|la&s;&s;es." The editor here readily grants, that the trade of foreign mela&s;&s;es, though illicit, is by far the lea&s;t injurious of any: And he, with truth, can &s;ay, that that &s;pecies of trade entered very little into the charge of &s;muggling, brought again&s;t the northern colonies. But does this <HI>Providence writer</HI> imagine, that the editor has &s;uch a da&s;tardly, temporizing &s;pirit, that he dares not &s;peak out what every body knows to be true? Is it not notorious, that a mo&s;t iniquitous, &s;muggling trade has been long carried on, from &s;eve|ral of the colonies, to Holland, and other foreign European countries, to the va&s;t prejudice of Great-Britain, and her manufactures? And there is not the lea&s;t kind of doubt, if the new in&s;tituted court of ad|miralty &s;hould be aboli&s;hed, and the men of war and cutters withdrawn from their &s;tations, but this &s;ame trade would be renewed, and practi&s;ed in &s;uch a man|ner, as to elude the contravention of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, however faithful and vigilant they might be. Can any one be &s;o ignorant of the world, as not to know, that money is almo&s;t become the &s;upreme good; and that the obligations of con&s;cience and duty, are but feeble re&s;traints, when pro&s;pects of great gain pre&s;ent them&s;elves? This is true every where.

The inclination to &s;muggle is equally prevalent in many parts of Great-Britain, the i&s;le of Man, &amp;c. The means u&s;ed to check it, in tho&s;e places, are rather more rigorous than here: And the editor is not yet per&s;uaded, "that the people of New-England are &s;uch philo&s;ophers and divines, compared with tho&s;e of Great-Britain," that their virtue is proof again&s;t the allurements of <HI>mammon.</HI> He thinks it no breach of charity to &s;ay, that if the fear of confi&s;cation and forfeiture was removed, the king's revenue would be as little regarded by the&s;e New-England philo&s;ophers and divines, as by any other people, though the law of both tables &s;hould look them full in the face: And he will pay them no compliment, at the expence of truth.&mdash;For &s;uch-like &s;entiments as the&s;e, the Hali|fax gentleman is threatened, by the <HI>Providence writer,</HI> with &s;omething that looks like a legal pro&s;ecution. He &s;ays, there has been little or no &s;muggling in the colonies. What violence does this unhappy devoted man commit again&s;t the dictates of his own heart. The editor here confe&s;&s;eth, he feels &s;ome indignation, mixed with pity, towards a per&s;on, who is &s;o lo&s;t to every manly &s;entiment, <Q>that the words of his mouth have no interpretation: His tongue and his heart are for ever at variance.</Q> To be threatened with a pro&s;ecution, from this <HI>Providence writer,</HI> is, indeed, enough to try one's patience.

<P>This pamphlet has an&s;wered two purpo&s;es: Fir&s;t, to &s;catter, upon the author of the Halifax letter, the mo&s;t unprovoked abu&s;e: And &s;econdly, by an unac|countable fatality, to &s;u&s;tain and confirm the principal argument contained in that letter. Though the <HI>Bo&s;ton writer</HI> is fairly foiled, he &s;hall find, in the editor, a generous antagoni&s;t, for he will not rob him of his weapons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bo&s;ton writer</HI> &s;ays, <HI>"It is certain, that the parliament of Great-Britain hath a ju&s;t, clear, equi|table, and con&s;titutional right, power, and authority, to bind the colonies, by all acts wherein they are named. Every lawyer, nay, every tyro, knows this. No le&s;s certain is it, that the parliament of Great-Britain have a ju&s;t and equitable right, power, and authority, to im|po&s;e taxes on the colonies, internal and external, on lands as well as on trade.</HI> Here he will certainly appear, in the opinion of his a&s;&s;ociates and ad|herents, to have &s;urrendered up all at di&s;cretion, and betrayed his whole party; for the above pa&s;&s;age con|tains a mo&s;t unre&s;erved and &s;olemn recognition of the ab&s;olute, unlimited authority of parliament over the colonies. The warmth of the expre&s;&s;ion, and the care taken to &s;hun all ambiguity, indicates the zeal of a new convert; for that he is a new convert, will appear from a pa&s;&s;age in his fir&s;t pamphlet, which he cites in page 27 of his pre&s;ent performance, in the&s;e words: <Q><HI>When</HI> the parliament &s;hall think fit to allow the coloni&s;ts a repre&s;entation in the hou&s;e of com|mons, the <HI>equity</HI> of their taxing the colonies <HI>will be</HI> as clear as their power is at pre&s;ent of doing it

without, if they plea&s;e.</Q> Hence it is evident, that when he wrote his fir&s;t pamphlet, the <HI>equity</HI> of taxing the colonies depended, in his opinion, upon their being, in fact, repre&s;ented in the hou&s;e of commons: for <HI>when</HI> that &s;hould be allowed, the <HI>equity</HI> of taxing <HI>would be</HI> as clear as their power is at pre&s;ent, &amp;c.

<P>It will afford &s;ome amu&s;ement to ob&s;erve here, that the pre&s;ent <HI>Providence writer</HI> was the author of the dream, taken notice of in page 8. The reader may recollect, that he there &s;ays, "He who tells me, that I am to be taxed where I have no repre&s;en|tative, does but <HI>mock</HI> me." The reader will al&s;o re|mark, that, in the preceeding paragraph, the <HI>Bo&s;ton writer</HI> &s;ays, that the parliament of Great-Britain may con&s;titutionally and equitably tax us, and yet we are not repre&s;ented. This will naturally produce &s;ome very diverting images. The &s;cene, at length, opens, and di&s;covers this amiable pair of writers; one of them dreaming, and the other mocking him.

confe&s;&s;ion he hath made of his new political principles. He has di&s;armed, by this very commen|dable declaration, the little re&s;entment the editor had again&s;t him, for the per&s;onal abu&s;e his piece contains: Therefore, he freely forgives, and at the &s;ame time congratulates him, on the happy conviction of his errors. But the work of repentance &s;hould not &s;top here; it is to be feared the <HI>honourable author</HI> is yet an unbeliever, and his conver&s;ion &s;hould be made a point of. When this is done, his <HI>honour</HI> and the <HI>Bo&s;ton writer</HI> &s;hould adju&s;t, together, the fallacy detected in his book: For though the argument was not any ways affected by that fallacy, yet it impeaches his ho|nour's under&s;tanding; or, at lea&s;t, his candor. When this is well &s;ettled, the terms, <HI>natural relation,</HI> between a mother &s;tate and its colonies, &s;hould be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed between him and the <HI>Providence writer.</HI> And when peace and unanimity are re&s;tored within their borders, they &s;hould form a new plan of operations, and de|pute one of their body to attack the Halifax letter; but they &s;hould, in all good policy, agree not to con|tradict or confute each other; for, be&s;ides the addi|tional trouble they give their antagoni&s;t, they weaken and de&s;troy the ground they &s;tand upon.</P>
<P>As the particular remarks upon the <HI>Providence writer</HI> are, in a great mea&s;ure, applicable to the ge|neral contents of the Bo&s;ton pamphlet; and as this latter contains nothing new, but is rather inferior to the former, both in the method and argument; it would be but dull repetition to &s;ay any thing further upon it. The editor, therefore, will take his leave of the <HI>Bo&s;ton writer;</HI> but mu&s;t fir&s;t balance the <HI>&s;ing-&s;ong,</HI> with part of that celebrated character of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius,</HI> (to compare &s;mall things with great) which <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has put in the mouth of <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>

<P>It is proper here to record, what, perhaps, may appear, a few years hence, almo&s;t incredible. At the general a&s;&s;embly of this colony, held at Ea&s;t-Greenwich, on the la&s;t Monday of February, A. D. 1765, the deputy-governor went down to the lower hou&s;e, with this harmle&s;s Halifax letter in his hand, and reque&s;ted them to take it into con&s;ideration, and pur&s;ue &s;uch mea&s;ures again&s;t the printer, or pamphlet, as they &s;hould think fit. Some warm members pu&s;hed on this motion, and, in their anger, &s;eemed to have forgot, that the liberty of the pre&s;s was &s;acred, and the greate&s;t bulwark of Briti&s;h freedom: They repre&s;ented the pamphlet as a libel, in&s;i&s;ted that the printer &s;hould be &s;ent for, and &s;ome were for burning the pamphlet by the hands of the common hangman. This was in the genuine &s;tyle of ea&s;tern de&s;poti&s;m, and reminds the editor, that he has &s;omewhere read of "two young ladies, in India, who were &s;hut up for life in a box, thick &s;et with pointed nails; one for having had a love intrigue, and the other for not di&s;clo&s;ing it." The i&s;&s;ue of this affair was, there were members in the hou&s;e, of virtue and moderation, who &s;aw nothing offen&s;ive in the pamphlet: And the application of the deputy-governor only &s;erved to &s;hew, that our &s;enators, in this in&s;tance, were neither acquainted with, or actuated by, the true principles of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="010012_0028_0F7B986CDEE2A978">While we lament how thin the partition is, between exce&s;s of liberty and ab&s;olute tyranny, it &s;hould be a plea&s;ing con&s;ideration, to every man in the colony, that his liberty and property are &s;ubject, in the la&s;t re&s;ort, to the care and animadver&s;ion of the mother country.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ition to the Halifax letter, however cholerick and fretful it be, bodes no evil to the editor. He does not mean to be vain, when he &s;ays, that he is independant in &s;pirit, and in circum&s;tances; he has not a wi&s;h which &s;eeks its gratification from the &s;miles of popularity: If he had, the arts of adulation and duplicity lie open to his choice, and would yield him the &s;ame harve&s;t which brings a triumph to tho&s;e, who prefer pre&s;ent fame to all other con&s;iderations. &mdash;He now takes leave of the public, and of his ad|ver&s;aries, his private concerns will not permit him to continue the di&s;pute any longer, whatever in&s;ults he may receive. Be&s;ides, he thinks it wi&s;dom to di&s;con|tinue a controver&s;y, which his antagoni&s;ts have already made per&s;onal, and therefore can an&s;wer no end, but to &s;our and provoke one again&s;t the other: Recrimi|nation throws no light upon the enquiry, and the &s;ubject becomes lo&s;t in a torrent of abu&s;e. <HI>Hae nugae, &s;eria ducunt in mala.</HI> "The madne&s;s of others &s;hall be a le&s;&s;on to him."

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the aforegoing &s;heets were committed to the pre&s;s, &s;eve|ral ve&s;&s;els have arrived from London, and brought intelligence, that the act of parliament, for levying a &s;tamp duty on the colo|nies, is actually pa&s;t: That, upon this occa&s;ion, not a &s;ingle member in the hou&s;e of commons &s;poke again&s;t taxing America; nor would one of them even introduce a petition, which &s;hould impeach the parlia|ment's right: That one member, in particular, &s;aid, "that where the colonies &s;tand on &s;uch high preten&s;ions of independance on the &s;upreme legi&s;lative authority of Great-Britain, there is no moderating any thing." His maje&s;ty's &s;peech, at opening the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ions, is al&s;o come over; wherein he &s;ays, he "relies on the wi&s;dom and firmne&s;s of parliament, to promote obedience to the laws, and reverence to the legi&s;lative authority of Great-Britain." In an&s;wer to this &s;peech, both hou&s;es, in terms equally &s;trong, have ecchoed back to the throne, the king's plea&s;ure, and declared their re&s;olution to maintain due re&s;pect to this authority.</P>
<P>The&s;e proceedings at home, have compleated the defence of the Halifax letter, beyond even the power of cavil or chicane. The par|liament, by pa&s;&s;ing the &s;tamp act, have determined the que&s;tion re&s;pect|ing their right of taxing the colonies, in &s;uch a manner, that no prudent or &s;en&s;ible man will ever hereafter di&s;pute it.</P>
<P>Although <HI>the rights of colonies a&s;&s;erted and proved,</HI> hath been vainly puffed, in a London news-paper, by &s;ome hungry book&s;eller, as a piece proper for the in&s;truction of both hou&s;es of parliament, yet the event has &s;hewn, that not a &s;ingle member is one grain the wi&s;er by it. The other pamphlets and news-papers, publi&s;hed in America, with the pe|titions and remon&s;trances, &s;ent home by the colonies, were TOO BOLD, TOO FREE; and, as it is &s;aid above, not a &s;ingle member would pre&s;ent one of them to the hou&s;e: But, on the contrary, it was declared, that the preten&s;ions of independency in the colonies, would not admit of any moderation towards them.</P>
<P>The reader is here intreated to look back a little into the Halifax gentleman's letter. In page 5, &s;peaking of his honour's pamphlet, he &s;ays, <Q>It were to be wi&s;hed, that &s;ome friends of the colonies would endeavour to remove any unfavourable impre&s;&s;ions, this and other pamphlets, of the like kind, may have occa&s;ioned at home; le&s;t tho&s;e in power form the general character of the colonies from &s;uch notices as the&s;e convey; and from thence be inclined to in|crea&s;e their dependance, rather than to emancipate them from their pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ed impo&s;itions.</Q> Again, <Q>This people, (of Great-Britain) ju&s;tly con&s;cious of their dignity, will not patiently be dicta|ted
<PB N="30" REF="010012_0030_0F7B986E3345FA00">
to, by tho&s;e, whom they have ever con&s;idered as dependant upon them.</Q> In page 16, he takes notice of the conduct of the hou&s;e of com|mons, in the year 1733, when the Rhode-I&s;land agent pre&s;ented a peti|tion again&s;t the then &s;ugar bill, containing preten&s;ions &s;omewhat &s;imilar to tho&s;e now &s;et up; and then &s;ays, <Q>From hence you may perceive, how little pro&s;pect there is of the colonies gaining any point, upon the footing of the&s;e new &s;uppo&s;ititious rights. Broach|ing &s;uch opinions, will excite the jealou&s;y of parliament, and you will be looked upon with an evil eye. The promoters of &s;uch doctrines are no friends to the colonies, whatever may be their pre|ten&s;ions. Can his honour be &s;o vain as to imagine, that ten thou|&s;and &s;uch pamphlets as his, will influence the parliament; or that they will be per&s;uaded, by the force of his elocution, to give up their &s;upremacy, and right of taxing the colonies? If we have any thing to a&s;k, we &s;hould remember, that diffidence and mode&s;ty will always obtain more, from generous minds, than frowardne&s;s and impertinence.</Q>&mdash;Whether the Halifax gentleman hath prophe|&s;ied truly or not, let his enemies now declare? Whether he hath de&s;erved the foul u&s;age he has received, let the public now &s;peak? If, in&s;tead of our high preten&s;ions to independance, fomented and &s;pirited up by tho&s;e gentry who oppo&s;e the Halifax letter, we had mode&s;tly repre&s;ented our poverty and inability to pay taxes, or pointed out to the parliament any other more &s;uitable, or le&s;s burden&s;ome method of taxation, we &s;hould have been li&s;tened to, with an indulgent and parental ear: We &s;hould have found the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, like APOLLO, rewarding our merit, in&s;tead of pu|ni&s;hing our pre&s;umption. But, ala&s;s! the fatal &s;haft is &s;ped; and tho&s;e who, from principles of fal&s;e patrioti&s;m, have led the colonies into the&s;e errors, will, &s;o long as taxes are felt by us, de&s;erve the execration and reproaches of their countrymen, whom they have thus betrayed and enthralled. At pre&s;ent, nothing remains, on our part, but a dutiful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. If the late mea&s;ures &s;eem hard, let us compare our con|dition with other nations and countries, and learn contentment. The <HI>honourable author</HI> mu&s;t now weep in &s;ilence, for what his lucubrations have not been able to accompli&s;h. The <HI>Providence dreamer,</HI> during the remainder of his re&s;tle&s;s, di&s;appointed days, mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the <HI>mockery</HI> of tho&s;e who acknowlege the parliamentary juri&s;diction. The <HI>Bo&s;ton writer,</HI> who cannot reli&s;h liberty, unle&s;s it be &s;tained with the mixture of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hould take a le&s;&s;on from his pre&s;ent bad &s;ucce&s;s, and venture no more to di&s;turb the harmony of the be&s;t con&s;ti|tution on earth; but rather &s;eek out &s;ome other region, more agreeable to his troubled &s;pirit, and unquiet imagination.</P>
