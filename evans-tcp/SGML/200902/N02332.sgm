<P>AND may <HI>We,</HI> Poor, Mean, Vile Bits of <HI>Clay,</HI> hope to be chang'd into, and found among, the&s;e Radiant <HI>Jewels? Lord, make us Thine, and we &s;hall be &s;o!</HI></P>
<P>THE Prophetic Spirit in the <HI>Conclu&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Old Testament</HI> foretells four hundred Years before they were accompli&s;hed, the Things that were to occur at the <HI>Beginning</HI> of the <HI>New.</HI> He foretells the coming of the RE|DEEMER, and of His <HI>Harbinger;</HI> and the <HI>Frame</HI> and the <HI>Fate</HI> of the People, at the Time when the&s;e Illu&s;trious Predictions, were to have their Accompli&s;hment. There would be a <HI>wicked People,</HI> who &s;hould be but <HI>Stubble</HI> in the Day of <HI>Burning Wrath,</HI> which would come from GOD upon the <HI>Jewi&s;h Nation.</HI> Un|to the&s;e GOD would <HI>leave neither Root nor
<PB N="2" REF="002766_0004_0FE62C46D01B4698">Branch;</HI> They were to be rejected of GOD; and they that &s;hould be left of them, would be &s;tanding Monuments of the <HI>Divine Venge|ance</HI> for the Admonition of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> But there would be al&s;o a <HI>Godly People;</HI> who would &s;tudiou&s;ly animate and e&s;tabli&s;h One a|nother, in the <HI>Faith</HI> of their only SAVIOUR. Of the&s;e it is foretold, <HI>They &s;hall be mine, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, in the Day when I make up my Jewels.</HI> None but <HI>They</HI> &s;hall now be owned by the GOD of Heaven, for True <HI>I&s;raelites; They,</HI> and the <HI>Gentiles</HI> a&s;&s;ociated with them, who &s;hould now take the place of the abdi|cated <HI>Jews</HI> in the Kingdom of GOD, and be a <HI>Surrogate I&s;rael. The&s;e</HI> the Glorious GOD, would now wonderfully di&s;tingui&s;h with His Favour: They &s;hould be of as much Regard with Him, as any <HI>Jewels</HI> can be to the owner of them.</P>
<P>THE DOCTRINE whereto I demand your Attention, is This.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, are the <HI>Jewels</HI> of GOD; And there will be a Day, when GOD our SAVIOUR will do <HI>That</HI> for His <HI>Children,</HI> which will be a <HI>making up</HI> of His <HI>Jewels.</HI></P>
<P>IT was a very In&s;tructive Action in a Roman Lady; who, when her Friends Vi&s;iting of her, de&s;ired her to &s;how them her <HI>Jewels,</HI> as they
<PB N="3" REF="002766_0005_0FE62C663AE73D28">had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, each in their Turn, Shown her <HI>Theirs,</HI> brought in her Well-educated <HI>Children,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>If you would &s;ee my Jewels, The&s;e are They! I have no Jewels comparable un|to The&s;e?</HI> But, How much more In&s;tructively, and with an how much more grateful Enter|tainment, are the Regenerated <HI>Children</HI> of GOD now to be brought forth, and have this Declaration made concerning them; <HI>The&s;e are the Jewels of GOD: When GOD &s;hall make up His Jewels, the&s;e will be among them.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. WE will Enquire, fir&s;t. On what Accounts it is, that the <HI>Children</HI> of GOD are to be look'd upon, as the <HI>Jewels</HI> of the Glorious LORD.</P>
<P>NOW, In general, The <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, are to Him, what a Valuable <HI>Trea&s;ure</HI> is to the Children of Men. When King <HI>Solomon</HI> had furni&s;hed him&s;elf with a &s;tore of <HI>Jewels,</HI> he &s;aid, Eccl. II. 8. <HI>I gathered me the peculiar Trea&s;ure of Kings.</HI> In the <HI>Wealth</HI> of King <HI>He|zekiah,</HI> we find this Article; 1 Chron. XXXII. 27. <HI>He, made him&s;elf Trea&s;uries for precious &s;tones, and for all manner of plea&s;ant Jewels.</HI> The <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, are to Him, a much more Valuable <HI>Trea&s;ure,</HI> than tho&s;e <HI>Jewels</HI> were to the <HI>Kings of the Ea&s;t</HI> The <HI>Great King who&s;e Name is Venerable,</HI> &s;ets a Value on His <HI>Children,</HI> and they are as a <HI>Trea&s;ure</HI> to Him. <HI>Lord, What is Man that thou do&s;t &s;o magnify him!</HI> The Hebrew Word, <HI>Segullah,</HI> which is here tran&s;lated <HI>Jewels,</HI> carries a <HI>peculiar Trea&s;ure,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="002766_0006_0FE62C46D58D22B8">in the Signification of it. It leads us to the Promi&s;e which the Glorious GOD made unto His People; Exod. XIX. 5. <HI>If ye will indeed obey my Voice, ye &s;hall be a peculiar Trea&s;ure un|to me, above all People.</HI> There is an <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> of which we are told P&s;al. CXXXV. 4. <HI>The Lord hath cho&s;en I&s;rael for His peculiar Trea&s;ure.</HI> All that <HI>Fear GOD and work Righteou&s;ne&s;s in every Nation,</HI> are the <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of GOD. All that <HI>Walk according to the Rule</HI> which is given us in the Go&s;pel of GOD, are the <HI>I&s;rael of GOD.</HI> We that are <HI>afar off,</HI> and the Children of &s;uch as were <HI>Aliens from the Common-wealth of I&s;rael,</HI> yea, though we &s;hould be the Children of <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> yet, if we <HI>wor&s;hip GOD in the Spi|rit, and Rejoyce in CHRIST JESUS,</HI> we are of as much Account with GOD as they that of old had <HI>Confidence in the Fle&s;h,</HI> and we are the genuine Children of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> Of whatever Na|tion we are, if we <HI>Live unto GOD,</HI> and <HI>Live by the Faith of the Son of GOD,</HI> we are <HI>I&s;raelites indeed.</HI> The Glorious GOD owns us for His <HI>Children;</HI> and we are His <HI>peculiar Trea&s;ure.</HI> 'Tis but a Tran&s;lation of the <HI>Segullah,</HI> which we render <HI>Jewels,</HI> that the People of GOD, even all the <HI>Redeemed</HI> of the Lord, and the Believers &amp; Followers of the Great REDEEM|ER, are called, Tit. II. 14. <HI>A Peculiar Trea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>MY Friends, Let the <HI>Fear of the Lord</HI> be our <HI>Trea&s;ure,</HI> and let us count our &s;elves <HI>Rich,</HI> yea, the <HI>Rich Heirs of all things,</HI> in having the Glorious GOD and His CHRIST, for our
<PB N="5" REF="002766_0007_0FE62BD2DCF5FC78"><HI>Portion.</HI> Then our GOD will make <HI>us</HI> His <HI>Trea&s;ure,</HI> and we &s;hall be more to Him, than a <HI>whole World</HI> left <HI>lying in Wickedne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>BUT we will proceed more particularly to con&s;ider, the Accounts on which the&s;e XEIMHAIA as we may call them, of GOD our SAVI|OUR, may be call'd, The <HI>Jewels</HI> of the Glori|ous Lord.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. THE <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, How <HI>Dear,</HI> How <HI>Dear,</HI> unto Him are they? No Prince can &s;et &s;uch a Price upon His <HI>Jewels,</HI> as the Glorious GOD &s;ets upon His <HI>Children.</HI> He &s;ays of them, <HI>They are the dearly beloved of my Soul.</HI> He &s;ays to them, <HI>I have loved thee with an everla&s;ting Love.</HI> About this Cabinet of <HI>Jewels,</HI> we find Him &s;aying, I&s;ai. XLIII. 4. <HI>Thou wast precious in my &s;ight, thou ha&s;t been Honourable; and I have loved thee; Therefore will I give Men for thee, and People for thy Life.</HI> So <HI>precious</HI> are the&s;e <HI>Jewels,</HI> to the Glorious GOD, that He will <HI>Destroy</HI> every thing that &s;tands in the way of the Good which He has to do for them. So <HI>precious</HI> are they, that in Times of com|mon De&s;olation, He &s;ets a <HI>Mark</HI> upon them for their <HI>Signal</HI> Pre&s;ervation. So <HI>precious</HI> are they, that He gives His <HI>Angels charge</HI> over them, and commits them to the <HI>Mini&s;tring Spirits,</HI> with a command unto them, to take the&s;e <HI>Heirs of Salvation</HI> into their Cu&s;tody. Yea, the Highe&s;t among tho&s;e who <HI>Ride upon the High places of the Earth,</HI> altho' they &s;hould
<PB N="6" REF="002766_0008_0FE62C49B17FC890">he tho&s;e who wear cloth of Gold, all &s;tudded with <HI>Jewels,</HI> are not of &s;uch <HI>precious E&s;teem</HI> with the Glorious GOD, as His <HI>Children</HI> that <HI>Chu&s;e the things that plea&s;e Him,</HI> though they make never &s;o mean an Appearance, and are the <HI>poor People in Vile Raiment,</HI> whom the <HI>Proud Ones</HI> of the Earth, would have to <HI>&s;it un|der their Foot&s;tool.</HI> Indeed, They have nothing in and of them&s;elves to recommend them unto a <HI>precious E&s;teem</HI> with GOD. If GOD have any <HI>E&s;teem</HI> for them, <HI>'Tis even &s;o, Father, be|cau&s;e it plea&s;es thee!</HI> The only <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of the <HI>E&s;teem</HI> which the Glorious GOD has for any, is that <HI>Rea&s;on of all Rea&s;ons,</HI> His <HI>Good Plea|&s;ure;</HI> which &s;ays, <HI>I loved thee, becau&s;e I loved thee.</HI> And it mu&s;t be &s;aid, as it is, in Ezek. XVI. 11, 12, 14. <HI>I decked thee with Ornaments, and I put a Jewel on thy Forchead; it was my comeline&s;s which I put upon thee, faith the Lord GOD.</HI> Even &s;o; O Child of GOD, If thou art made a <HI>Jewel,</HI> 'tis from the <HI>Comeline&s;s</HI> which the <HI>Lord GOD</HI> Him&s;elf has given to thee.</P>
<P>Secondly. THE <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, How much <HI>Better</HI> are they, than the <HI>common Chil|dren of Men,</HI> that are no more than &s;o? Ve|rily, as much <HI>Better,</HI> as <HI>Jewels</HI> are better than the <HI>common Stones</HI> of the <HI>Street,</HI> and of the <HI>Field!</HI> He was a competent Judge, who &s;aid of &s;uch; P&s;al. XVI. 3. <HI>They are the Saints in the Earth, and the Excellent in whom is all my Delight.</HI> This <HI>Excellent</HI> Man had a Son, who
<PB N="7" REF="002766_0009_0FE62BD2E1D7CD98">e&s;pou&s;ed his Fathers Maxims, and has left this unto us; Prov. XII. 26. <HI>The Righteous is more Excellent than his Neighbour.</HI> They are <HI>De&s;ireable</HI> Ones: A Change of their <HI>Nature</HI> has made them &s;o. The <HI>Love</HI> of GOD and of their Neighbour coming to reign in them, has made them &s;o. The&s;e <HI>Renewed</HI> Ones, by a <HI>Sanctify|ing Work</HI> of GOD upon them, come to be Per|&s;ons of an <HI>Excellent Spirit.</HI> Yea, If <HI>Wi&s;dom excelleth Folly, as far as Light excelleth Dark|ne&s;s,</HI> then the&s;e <HI>Children of Light</HI> are more <HI>Ex|cellent</HI> than they who <HI>walk in Darkne&s;s.</HI> Their <HI>Principles</HI> are <HI>Excellent Principles,</HI> and their <HI>Practices</HI> are <HI>Excellent Practices.</HI> There are <HI>Engravings</HI> upon the&s;e <HI>Jewels;</HI> The <HI>Image</HI> of GOD is <HI>Engraved</HI> upon them. There is a <HI>Worth</HI> in them. The Wicked who are <HI>little Worth,</HI> may truly &s;ay to the lea&s;t of the&s;e, <HI>Thou art worth Ten Thou&s;and of us.</HI> Indeed, they &s;tudy to <HI>Do Good;</HI> while the Wicked are but &s;o many <HI>Hinder goods.</HI> They are the <HI>Jewels</HI> of the <HI>Societies</HI> they belong unto; ina&s;much as they &s;tudy to be <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> unto the <HI>Societies.</HI> They <HI>Exalt the City</HI> that has them in it. All that are concerned in them, fare the <HI>Better</HI> for them. They are called, <HI>Profitable Ones.</HI> If there were nothing el&s;e, yet the very <HI>Prayers</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Humble Ones,</HI> help to fetch down <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> on all about them: When the <HI>Chil|dren of the Wicked One,</HI> only pull down <HI>Judg|ments</HI> on the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002766_0010_0FE62C49B634BD50">
Thirdly. THEY <HI>Shine!</HI> The <HI>Children</HI> of GOD have a &s;ingular <HI>Lu&s;tre</HI> in them. The&s;e <HI>Jewe's</HI> have a &s;parkling Beauty in them. Their <HI>Wi&s;|dom</HI> cau&s;es their <HI>Faces to &s;hine;</HI> Their <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> gives an <HI>Ornament of Grace</HI> unto them. GOD is <HI>Light;</HI> and they have &s;o much of GOD in them, that it may be &s;aid of them, <HI>Truly, The Light in them is &s;weet.</HI> Yea, it has been &s;aid, Phil. II. 15. <HI>Ye &s;hine as Lights in the World.</HI> No &s;ooner did they turn to GOD, but there was that Voice of Heaven over them, <HI>Ari&s;e and &s;hine; for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the Lord is ari&s;en upon thee.</HI> Henceforward, they become <HI>Lights;</HI> Yea, not only <HI>Shining</HI> but <HI>Burning Lights,</HI> and &s;uch as are to be <HI>Rejoyced in.</HI> Being <HI>Illuminated of GOD,</HI> they become the <HI>Guides of the Blind,</HI> the <HI>Lights of them that are in Darkne&s;s,</HI> the <HI>Instructors of the Fooli&s;h.</HI> They are &s;o <HI>Enlightned</HI> from the <HI>Sun of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> that GOD <HI>&s;hines</HI> in them. And their <HI>In&s;truction,</HI> and their <HI>Example,</HI> is for the <HI>Enlighten|ing</HI> of tho&s;e that behold them. Their <HI>Path</HI> is as the <HI>&s;hining Light.</HI> Of tho&s;e whom our Lord makes the <HI>Teachers</HI> of others, we read, <HI>Rev.</HI> I. 16. <HI>He had in His Right Hand &s;even Stars. Jewels</HI> are not unlike to <HI>Stars,</HI> for their Brightne&s;s; and Writers often u&s;e the Name of the one for the other. To have <HI>Stars in the Hand,</HI> is the fame as to have <HI>Jewels</HI> that are &s;et in <HI>Rings</HI> on the Hand. Our Lord makes His Faithful Servants to be <HI>Jewels,</HI> like <HI>Stars</HI> in His Hand; When He makes them <HI>Teachers,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="002766_0011_0FE62BD4ADA0D4F8">and <HI>Light</HI> is from Him Communicated by them. Yea, Even with Luminous and Ethere|al <HI>Bodies</HI> be&s;towed upon them, they &s;hall one Day <HI>Shine as the Brightne&s;s of the Firmament, and as the Stars forever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. YEA, more than &s;o. The <HI>Children</HI> of GOD are what the SON of GOD Him&s;elf, wears as His <HI>Ornaments.</HI> He &s;hows them for &s;uch, and with Plea&s;ure &s;ays, <HI>Behold, The Chil|dren which GOD has given me!</HI> They are the <HI>Jewels</HI> which our SAVIOUR is not only <HI>Arrayed,</HI> but even reckons Him&s;elf <HI>Adorned</HI> withal. They are &s;o, when they <HI>Adorn the Doctrine of GOD our SAVIOUR in all things.</HI> The&s;e are they to whom our GOD &s;ays; I&s;ai. LXII. 3. <HI>Thou &s;halt be a Crown of Glory in the Hand of the Lord, and a Royal Diadem in the Hond of thy GOD.</HI> They may indeed be called, <HI>Jewels of the Crown.</HI> Our Glorious Lord, u&s;es them for His <HI>Crown;</HI> and makes His more than <HI>Royal Diadem</HI> to glitter with them. When our SA|VIOUR &s;ays, <HI>The Righteous &s;hall compa&s;s me a|bout;</HI> it may be read, <HI>The Righteous &s;hall be a Crown unto me.</HI> We find this a&s;toni&s;hing Dig|nity put upon &s;ome, who were eminent for Holine&s;s, and Watchfulne&s;s, and U&s;efulne&s;s; 2 Cor. VIII. 23. <HI>They were the Glory of CHRIST.</HI> Our Great SAVIOUR Exhibits His Cho&s;en and Called Ones, with the effects of His Grace up|on them, and &s;ays, <HI>This is the People whom I have thus formed for my &s;elf; They &s;hew forth
<PB N="10" REF="002766_0012_0FE5F4939DFE2190">my Prai&s;e!</HI> When they have &s;uch a <HI>Mind,</HI> and &s;uch a <HI>Walk,</HI> as He had; and when He has prepared them in <HI>every good Work to do the Will of GOD,</HI> and <HI>wrought</HI> in them what is <HI>well|plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of GOD,</HI> &amp; has <HI>Forgiven</HI> their <HI>Iniquities, &amp; Relieved</HI> their <HI>Infirmities,</HI> and <HI>Crown|ed</HI> them with His <HI>Kindne&s;&s;es,</HI> Now, Helooks on them as a <HI>Glory</HI> to Him. So He produced a <HI>Job</HI> of old, as one of His <HI>Jewels;</HI> &amp; &s;aid, <HI>Ha&s;t thou con|&s;idered him? Con&s;ider what a Perfect and Upright Man, there is of my making in him!</HI> And &s;o, when He de&s;cends from Heaven, with &s;uch as will have His Work fini&s;hed on them, He will then be <HI>Glorified in His Saints, and admired in all them that believe.</HI> The King of <HI>Tyrus,</HI> be|ing &s;urrounded with <HI>Jewels,</HI> and <HI>having every precious Stone for his covering,</HI> has his <HI>Glory</HI> &s;o de&s;cribed unto us; <HI>Thou wa&s;t upon the Holy Mountain of GOD; thou ha&s;t walked up and down in the midst of the stones of Fire.</HI> Our Ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, being &s;urrounded with &s;uch as <HI>Delight</HI> in Him, and &s;uch as <HI>Derive</HI> the <HI>Beauties of Holine&s;s</HI> from Him, has <HI>every preci|ous &s;tone for a covering;</HI> and He <HI>walks up and down in the mid&s;t of the &s;tones of Fire.</HI> And He &s;o di&s;plays His <HI>Glory</HI> from the <HI>Holy Mountain of GOD unto us.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly. AND will He &s;uffer any of them to be lo&s;t? No, He does <HI>Prize</HI> them too much for <HI>That;</HI> They have <HI>Co&s;t</HI> Him too much for <HI>That.</HI> The <HI>Children</HI> of GOD &s;hall be as
<PB N="11" REF="002766_0013_0FE5F48F4B8A1DE8">much look'd after, as if they were His <HI>Jewels.</HI> GOD the FATHER has betru&s;ted our SAVI|OUR with His <HI>Children</HI> as His <HI>Jewels:</HI> And our SAVIOUR &s;ays, John X. 27. <HI>They &s;hall ne|ver peri&s;h, neither &s;hall any pluck them out of my Hand.</HI> All the Attempts of Hell, to ruin the Children of GOD, or to rob Him of His <HI>Jewels,</HI> or break the <HI>Jewels</HI> to pieces, will all come to nothing.

They are called, <HI>His purcha&s;ed Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI> Hereupon, He is continually <HI>poli&s;hing</HI> of them, and bringing them into the admira|ble <HI>Shape,</HI> in the <HI>Prede&s;tination</HI> of GOD intend|ed for them. And, though they <HI>are an exceed|ing great Multitude, which no Man can Number,</HI> yet not one of them &s;hall mi&s;carry.

II. WE mu&s;t Enquire, <HI>When</HI> and <HI>How</HI> it is, that the Glorious LORD will <HI>make up</HI> the&s;e <HI>Jewels.</HI></P>
<P>Briefly; THERE is a Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Bundle of Life,</HI> whereof it was once foretold unto a very Bright one among the <HI>Jewels</HI> of GOD; 1 Sam. XXV. 29 <HI>The Soul of my Lord &s;hall be bound in the Bundle of Life with the Lord thy GOD.</HI> When a Soul is brought into that <HI>Bundle,</HI> by being brought unto &s;incere PIETY, and &s;o into the <HI>Life</HI> of GOD; And there &s;hall be an <HI>A&s;&s;embling</HI> of every &s;uch <HI>Soul,</HI> even, a bringing of them all together in the Enjoyment of <HI>Everla&s;ting Life;</HI> This is the <HI>making up</HI> of the <HI>Jewels.</HI></P>
<P>THE Fir&s;t Thing to be affirmed, is, That our Glorious LORD <HI>makes up</HI> His <HI>Jewels,</HI> when He <HI>makes them Jewels.</HI> What we read, <HI>I make up my Jewels,</HI> may be read, <HI>I am the Maker of my Jewels.</HI> 'Tis verily &s;o; GOD our SAVI|OUR, may &s;ay of all His <HI>Jewels,</HI> what is in I&s;ai. LX. 21. <HI>They are the Work of my Hands, that I may be glorified.</HI> The <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, are no better than &s;orry <HI>Pebble Stones,</HI> till His Good SPIRIT Enter them, and Refine them, and Sublimate them, and make <HI>New Creatures</HI> of them. That which makes <HI>Jewels</HI> of them, is This; Eph. II. 10. <HI>We are the Workman&s;hip of GOD, created in CHRIST JESUS unto good Works.</HI> Learned and Curious Things have been written by Philo&s;ophers, about, <HI>The Ori|gin of Gems.</HI> But the true <HI>Origin</HI> of the&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="002766_0015_0FE62BD4B26D58F8"><HI>Jewels,</HI> is a marvellous <HI>Work</HI> of GOD upon a mi&s;erable Soul, <HI>Transforming</HI> of it; and the imprinting His <HI>Image</HI> upon it, <HI>from Glory to Glory.</HI> And there is a <HI>making up</HI> of the <HI>Jewels,</HI> in His thus <HI>making</HI> of them to be what now they are; and &s;o making a <HI>Seizure</HI> on them. There is an Eternal Purpo&s;e of <HI>Election,</HI> in which it is decreed, That &s;uch a Number of <HI>Jewels</HI> is to be the <HI>Peculiar Trea&s;ure</HI> of GOD; and that &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons are to make up the Number.

<P>BUT then, Secondly. 'TIS to be further ex|pected, That the Final, and more perfect and compleat <HI>making up</HI> of the <HI>Jewels,</HI> will be, <HI>in the Day,</HI> when our Glorious LORD will have his <HI>Jewels</HI> to be all together <HI>with Him, where He is, that they may behold His Glory.</HI> We read 2 The&s;. II. 1. <HI>Concerning the coming of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and our gathering together un|to Him.</HI> Our <HI>gathering together</HI> unto our Lord JESUS CHRIST, will be His <HI>making up of His Jewels.</HI> It is in the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> in the <HI>Future World,</HI> that the <HI>Children</HI> of GOD will
<PB N="14" REF="002766_0016_0FE62C512A662BF8">have tho&s;e Things done for them, which will <HI>make up His Jewels</HI> for Him. The <HI>Jewels</HI> have continually &s;omething done towards the <HI>Mak|ing of them up,</HI> and the <HI>Spirits</HI> of the Faith|ful are, upon their Expiration, fetch'd away into the <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> of GOD. While the <HI>Jewels</HI> are here below, they are in the <HI>Jewellers</HI> Shop, where they are Grinding, and Clean&s;ing, and Fitting, that they may be <HI>made meet for the In|heritance of the Saints in Light.</HI> The Glorious LORD fetches them away, One after another, in what He will have to be the mo&s;t <HI>proper Sea&s;on</HI> for it. And as the&s;e are <HI>Taking up,</HI> He is therein <HI>making up</HI> the <HI>Jewels,</HI> which He will <HI>bring with Him,</HI> when He comes to the <HI>Rai&s;ing of the Dead.</HI> After the <HI>Re&s;urrection of the Dead,</HI> we &s;hall &s;ee that wondrous Thing; Heb.

That in the Vi&s;ions of GOD, we may be now <HI>carried away,</HI> to a <HI>Great and High Moun|tain,</HI> where we may &s;ee that <HI>Great City,</HI> the <HI>Holy Jeru&s;alem!</HI> Chri&s;tians, Take a View of

<P>&para; WE may now at length Enquire, What IMPROVEMENT we are to make of the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>AND here, One might indeed propo&s;e, What <HI>U&s;age</HI> the <HI>Children</HI> of GOD &s;hould of Right meet withal; What <HI>Re&s;pect</HI> is due to the <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, from a <HI>World,</HI> which, alas, <HI>Knows them not.</HI> Certainly, If the Glori|ous GOD looks upon them as His <HI>Jewels,</HI> the People among whom they &s;ojourn, &s;hould not <HI>Mal-treat</HI> them, and look on them as their <HI>Burdens</HI> or their <HI>Blemi&s;hes.</HI> No, They really are the <HI>Jewels</HI> of the Places wherein they are <HI>Pilgrims:</HI> And all the Citizens of <HI>Zion</HI> mu&s;t count them &s;o; Yea, of &s;uch an One we read, P&s;al.

<P>HOWEVER, To be a little Even with the <HI>Wicked,</HI> before we leave them; It might be propo&s;ed, That a <HI>ju&s;t Contempt</HI> may be ca&s;t up|on tho&s;e <HI>Wicked</HI> Ones, who&s;e <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion</HI> &s;ays, <HI>There is no Fear of GOD before their Eyes.</HI> This al&s;o is a Character, by which the Citizens of <HI>Zion</HI> are di&s;covered; <HI>A Vile Per&s;on is contem|ned in the Eyes of &s;uch an One.</HI> Every One who evidently <HI>Hates</HI> GOD, and <HI>Wrongs</HI> His Neighbour, is a <HI>Vile Per&s;on.</HI> There is One, who has at this Day more Va&s;&s;als than any Monarch upon Earth, but one whom the Book of GOD calls, <HI>A Vile Per&s;on.</HI> The <HI>Vicar of the Devil</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> is that <HI>Vile Per&s;on.</HI> Every <HI>De|&s;pi&s;er</HI>

<P>BUT the main Thing to be pre&s;s'd upon us, is; To pre&s;s after, to make out for, to make &s;ure of, this Incomparable Felicity; That we may be found among the <HI>Jewels</HI> of GOD, <HI>in the Day when He &s;hall make up His Jewels.</HI></P>
<P>IT is foretold, as the <HI>Glory</HI> of the Church in the latter Days; I&s;ai. LIV. 11, 12. <HI>I will lay thy Foundations with Saphires; and I will make thy Windows of Agates, and thy Gates of Carbun|cles, and all thy Borders of plea&s;ant Stones.</HI> Oh!

<P>THE Fir&s;t Thing which we are therefore to be directed to, is; Let us become <HI>the Lord's;</HI> By a mo&s;t Voluntary and Immediate <HI>Re&s;igna|tion</HI> and <HI>Con&s;ecration</HI> of our &s;elves unto Him, let us become <HI>the Lord's.

Let thy An&s;wer to the&s;e Over|tures be That; P&s;al. CXIX. 94. <HI>Lord, I am Thine, Save me!</HI> The Glorious LORD will now own thee for One of His <HI>Jewels.</HI> And as the <HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> of old, had <HI>Jewels on his Breast-plate,</HI> whereon the Tribes of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had their Names Engraved: Thou art one of tho&s;e, who&s;e <HI>Names</HI> are Engraven on the <HI>Breast plate</HI> of thy SAVIOUR; He &s;ets thee as a <HI>Seal upon His Arm.</HI> Thou art with Him, and on Him, and in Him, and as One of His <HI>Jewels,</HI> when He does as the <HI>High Priest</HI> of His People, <HI>Enter within the Vail,</HI> with an <HI>Interce&s;&s;ion</HI> that <HI>&s;aves to the Uttermo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THE Second Thing whereto we are to be directed, is This; Let us <HI>Have Jewels,</HI> and we &s;hall <HI>Be Jewels.</HI> Let us obtain as much as we can of tho&s;e things, which are the mo&s;t <HI>Ine&s;ti|mable Jewels.</HI> You &s;hall now be pointed unto &s;ome <HI>Ine&s;timable Jewels;</HI> whereof you are to be advi&s;ed, let not &s;uch &s;orry <HI>Barley-Corns,</HI> as the be&s;t Things of this World, be, (as in the Ancient Parable) preferr'd with you, before &s;uch <HI>Inestimable Jewels.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t. WHAT Think you of a Glorious CHRIST? Verily, A CHRIST, A CHRIST, is what you read; Mat. XIII. 46. <HI>A Pearl of Great Price.</HI> An <HI>Union</HI> with a CHRIST: Oh!

<P>AGAIN; What think you of tho&s;e Things, which are called, <HI>The Fruits of the Spirit!</HI> When we read of, <HI>Pure Religion and Undefiled,</HI> it is an Allu&s;ion to a <HI>Jewel,</HI> that fir&s;t is no <HI>Counterfeit,</HI> and then has no <HI>Flaws</HI> in it.

<P>ONCE more; What Think you of the <HI>Pro|mi&s;es,</HI> in the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD? The <HI>Good Words</HI> provided for the <HI>Hearts that are &s;tooping with Heavine&s;s?</HI> How can you reckon them any o|ther than &s;o many <HI>Jewels?</HI> The Value of every One among tho&s;e Glittering and Peerle&s;s <HI>Con|&s;olations of GOD;</HI> Oh! 'Tis beyond all Com|putation! Whole Rocks of <HI>Diamonds</HI> are not worth &s;o much as one of the&s;e <HI>Jewels.</HI> We are told, 2 Pet.

<P>Finally; WHATEVER you attain unto, yet never be <HI>Jewels</HI> in your own Eyes. Ly al|ways in the <HI>Du&s;t.</HI> Yea, Be not Impatient, if <HI>Man</HI> as well as GOD lay you in the <HI>Du&s;t,</HI> and if you &s;ee your &s;elves <HI>De&s;pi&s;ed and Reject|ed of Men.</HI> See nothing Valuable in your

<P>SHE was born <HI>September</HI> 15. 1668. She was Marryed fir&s;t unto Mr. <HI>John Deni&s;on,</HI> a Young Gentleman of Uncommon Accompli&s;hments and Expectations; of whom the Church of <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> hoped, <HI>Under his &s;hadow we &s;hall &s;it many Years!</HI> and he was a <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> to them, of who&s;e <HI>Fruit</HI> they ta&s;ted with an Uncommon &s;atisfacti|on. By him She had the late Col. <HI>John Deni|&s;on.</HI> But became his Di&s;con&s;olate Widow in the Year 1689.</P>
<P>SHE was after this Married unto Mr. <HI>Roland Cotton</HI> the Faithful Mini&s;ter of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> who
<PB N="29" REF="002766_0031_0FE62BDDD577B270">Died in the beginning of the Year 1722. By whom &s;he has <HI>Ten Children</HI> left Surviving (<HI>Five</HI> of them <HI>Sons</HI>) who with Hearts full of Sorrow, and calling her <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> followed her unto the Grave in <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> where &s;he was found Prepared and Ripened for the Heavenly World; on <HI>July</HI> 9. 1726.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Dorcas</HI> was Dead they produced the Effects of her <HI>Needle,</HI> as Te&s;timonies for her.</P>
<P>On the Death of this Gentlewoman we will produce Two or Three Effects of her <HI>Pen,</HI> which we will &s;ingle out from others, becau&s;e of a &s;ingular Adaptation in them to &s;erve &s;ome <HI>De&s;igns</HI> of PIETY which are of much more Concern to us, than the <HI>Prai&s;es</HI> of the Decea&s;ed.

<Q><P>IT has plea&s;ed GOD by the Striving of his SPIRIT on my Heart (which I a long

<P>THESE <HI>Con&s;iderations</HI> put me on an <HI>En|quiry,</HI> (with the Jaylor) <HI>What &s;hall I do to be Saved?</HI> Where I found an An&s;wer ready; <HI>Believe on the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and thou &s;halt be Saved.</HI> But I found an <HI>impotency</HI> in in my &s;elf to <HI>believe,</HI> to <HI>repent,</HI> to <HI>pray,</HI> to do any <HI>good Thing</HI> after a right manner. Some|times when I was Ruminating on &s;uch things as the&s;e, I thought it my Duty to ask, <HI>If I ever intended to receive;</HI> for to &s;uch is given a <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> Matth. 7.7. <HI>Ask and it &s;hall be gi|ven to you, &s;eek and ye &s;hall find.</HI> I was con|vinced that it was my Duty to <HI>pray.</HI> But I knew not <HI>how</HI> to perform this Duty; and was many times <HI>di&s;couraged</HI> therein, by thinking on &s;uch like Texts of Scripture as the&s;e. <HI>The Prayer of the Wicked is an Abomi|nation

And, <HI>What ha&s;t thou to do to take my Covenant into thy Mouth?</HI> I I do verily think and fear, my <HI>pre&s;ent Condi|tion</HI> is &s;uch, that I am as yet alienated and e&s;tranged from GOD and His Ways. I take no <HI>Delight</HI> in doing his Will, and yet go on to <HI>Omit</HI> known Duties and <HI>commit</HI> manife&s;t Sins. When I <HI>pray,</HI> it is but in a cold for|mal Manner; and though I am thoroughly convinced of the Indi&s;pen&s;ible Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Regeneration</HI> and an <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> in CHRIST, and the <HI>Pardon</HI> of Sin; and al&s;o the <HI>readine&s;s</HI> of GOD to grant it to them that de&s;ire it; Yet &s;uch is the backwardne&s;s of my Heart, that I am <HI>not willing</HI> to <HI>for&s;ake Sin,</HI> though by foregoing the &s;ame I obtain everla&s;ting Salvation, and by retaining it I incur Eter|nal Damnation. Much Comfort I have re|ceived from many Places of Scripture of late; In particular the&s;e; I&s;aiah. 1.17, 18. And 43.25. Ezek. 16.6, 8, 9. And 36.26, 27.</P>
<P>I have had many thoughts concerning my <HI>future State</HI> and Condition; but not &s;o many (I fear) as to put me upon the Practice of the Apo&s;tle's Advice, of <HI>working out my Sal|vation with Fear and Trembling;</HI> but I do yet continue in a <HI>State of Nature,</HI> in a Gracele&s;s Condition, and in &s;uch a State, that if the Judge of the whole World &s;hould Summon me <HI>this Night</HI> to appear before him, I &s;hould peri&s;h for Ever.

<P><HI>O Immortal Soul! How can&s;t thou &s;leep this Night, or take any Repo&s;e, whil&s;t thou art in &s;uch a peri&s;hing State?

And as I am convinced of his being <HI>able,</HI> &s;o al&s;o am <HI>I</HI> of his being <HI>willing</HI> to Save.

<P><HI>I</HI> find this <HI>Repentance</HI> to be an hard Work; A difficult Work! <HI>I</HI> mu&s;t part with <HI>Bo&s;om Sins,</HI> and a <HI>Right Eye,</HI> and a <HI>Right Hand,</HI> if <HI>I</HI> will be a Di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t.</P>

<P>THE Con&s;ideration of the <HI>Brevity</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> the <HI>Certainty of Death,</HI> and after that of the <HI>Judgment,</HI> and of <HI>Eternity, I</HI> upon this thought <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Coun&s;el to be the be&s;t that could be given, Eccl. 12.1. <HI>Remember thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth,</HI> and Health, <HI>before the Evil Days</HI> of old Age and Death <HI>do come.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I</HI> have too too much cau&s;e to fear, that if <HI>I</HI> &s;hould be taken away by <HI>Sudden Death</HI> (which <HI>I</HI> pray GOD prevent while <HI>I</HI> con|tinue in a State of Nature) <HI>I</HI> &s;hould be Eternally &s;eparated from the Pre&s;ence of GOD, which is the <HI>&s;ore&s;t Puni&s;hment</HI> that can be inflicted on any Creature.
