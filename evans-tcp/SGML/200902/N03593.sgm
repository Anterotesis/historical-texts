<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough Preaching be more profitable to the Chri&s;tian World than Writing; yet both Hearing and Reading are Means of divine Appointment, for the Conver&s;ion of GOD's Elect, and building up the Church of CHRIST in Knowledge, Faith and Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Principal does not exclude Coadjuvant Means of Grace. We hear Mini&s;ters Speaking in the Name of the eternal KING, (who&s;e Amba&s;&s;adors they are) with Life and Power; and their feeling Af|fections and flaming Zeal, are apt to kindle a Fire in our Brea&s;t by the Spirits in-breathing, without which the mo&s;t charming Voice, is but as a lovely Song, making Melody in the Ear, never Penetrating the Heart.</P>
<P>On the other Hand; written Sermons vani&s;h not in the Air; but abide in our View; are of more frequent, exten&s;ive, la&s;ting U&s;e; and may, by deli|berate Peru&s;al, be more fully under&s;tood, which is a nece&s;&s;ary, and the fir&s;t Step to profiting: For, if in hearing the Word, we under&s;tand it not, the Devil is ready to catch away the precious Seed, le&s;t we &s;hould <HI>believe</HI> and be <HI>&s;aved; Mat.</HI> 13.19. <HI>Luke</HI> 8.12, compar'd. Certain it is, the Lord mu&s;t teach us to
<PB N="ii" REF="004390_0003_100D4DAF04FEB790">profit, if ever Good come of our Hearing, or Read|ing; from him alone is our Fruit found: And in|deed its alike ea&s;y with the Almighty to do us good by his Word preached or written; &s;ingly or both to|gether.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ethiophan</HI> Eunuch was reading the Things concerning Chri&s;t, out of the evangelical Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> Capt. 53. ver. 7. when the Spirit of GOD &s;ent <HI>Philip</HI> to preach unto him JESUS; &s;o his Faith came by hearing the Word preached; according to that of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.14 &mdash; 17. This is GOD's ordinary and &s;tanding Method of converting SOULS: Such therefore as would excu&s;e their Neglect of A&s;&s;embling them&s;elves together, to hear the joyful Sound, by their giving Attendance to Reading on the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> at Home, are quite: out of the Way of GOD's Ble&s;&s;ing: But when the LORD is &s;ought <HI>&s;ea&s;onably,</HI> and <HI>Diligently</HI> in all Means, he will be found in &s;ome of them; yea, in all of them will GOD be found, by &s;uch as <HI>diligently &s;eek him, Heb.</HI> 11.6 Reading the Holy Scriptures, and good Books, that are according to the Prophets, and Apo&s;tles, and the Doctrine preached by JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf, &s;hall prepare us for Hearing; and the Word preached &s;hall excite us to, and teach us how to profit by Reading: Prov 8.33, 34 <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the Man that heareth me, watching daily at my Gates, waiting at the Po&s;ts of my Doors.</HI> Rev. 1.3. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is he that readeth, and they that hear the Words of this Prophe&s;y, and keep tho&s;e things that are written therein.</HI> Not only are the &s;acred Scriptures an incomparable Trea&s;ure; but the Writ|ings of the meane&s;t of Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters are a pre|cious Talent. To be much in Reading is a very
<PB N="iii" REF="004390_0004_100D4DB1BAC49228">profitable Way of improving our Time. It's true, we may read much, and profit little; while we have no Faith, or none in exerci&s;e, to mix the Word with, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.2 While, in&s;tead of laying apart all Filthine&s;s, and Superfluity of Naughtine&s;s, that we may receive with Meekne&s;s, the engraffed Word, which is able to &s;ave our Souls, <HI>James</HI> 1.21. We are prone to be captious and quarrel&s;ome; and Wri|ters as well as Preachers are a Savour of Death unto Death unto &s;ome, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.16. In&s;tead of &s;erious Deliberation, and &s;olemn Self-application; deep, fixed Meditation, and fervent Prayer, before, in, and after Reading, we run over a whole Book, perhaps, without lifting the Soul up to Heaven in &s;o much as one &s;ingle Ejaculation for a Ble&s;&s;ing. Yea, its well if our Bottom De&s;ign, in taking the Book in Hand, and glancing on here and there a Page, be not to judge the Author: at lea&s;t, if we buy or borrow a good Book, at any Time, with a purpo&s;e to read it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ut; our extravagant Thoughts are too much taken up, from the Title Page to the Conclu|&s;ion, in exalting or deba&s;ing the Writer, commend|ing or di&s;prai&s;ing the &s;piritual Food; not &s;o much according to its real Suitablene&s;s for our Nouri&s;h|ment and Growth in Grace, as according to the reli&s;h of our nice, vitiated, &s;ickly Appetites. But &s;uppo&s;e we tolerably &s;hun the&s;e gro&s;&s;er Defects, in improving the Talent of good Books; yet, we content our &s;elves in once reading them; which if we were only to judge them, is not &s;ufficient; and in a re|view, we may find good Rea&s;on to rever&s;e our fir&s;t Sentence, in this, as well as in many other Ca&s;es. In a Word, the main Thing is to receive the Truth in the Love of it, and bring forth Fruit with Pati|ence.
<PB N="iv" REF="004390_0005_100D4DB3C2E349D0">Unle&s;s we be Doers of the Word, and not Readers only, tho' it &s;hould be with Tears of affec|tion, it is &s;elf-deceiving; <HI>James 1.22.</HI></P>
<P>All that I &s;hall per&s;ume to &s;ay concerning the following SERMONS is, that de&s;igning to Publi&s;h even while I was &s;tudying them, I was the more &s;olicitous, (not knowing what nor how to write as I ought) that the allwi&s;e and good SPIRIT would plea&s;e to help my Infirmities, and provide an Offering that might plea&s;e him&s;elf, (who ever were di&s;plea&s;|ed;) and he fit for his U&s;e, in edifying the &s;piritual Building of the Church; at lea&s;t, that part of it over which the Holy Gho&s;t had made me Over&s;eer. And if there be any Worth at all in the en&s;uing Pages, its wholly owing to CHRIST. Not by Fle&s;h|ly Wi&s;dom; but by the Grace of GOD they are what they are.

<Q><BIBL><HI>Luke XIII. 28.</HI></BIBL>
<P>There &s;hall be Weeping and Gna&s;hing of Teeth, when ye &s;hall &s;ee <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and you your &s;elves thru&s;t out.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words are &s;ome Part of our Saviour's An&s;wer to a Que&s;tion, that was propounded by one of his hearers; ver. 23 <HI>Then</HI> (i. e. while he was, or when he had been Teaching, v. 22) <HI>&s;aid one unto him, Lord, are they few that be &s;aved?</HI> Chri&s;t's An&s;wer follows in the &s;even &s;ub&s;equent Ver&s;es; in which our Lord exhorts, or commands that they <HI>&s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate,</HI> ver. 24 which duty of highe&s;t Importance, our Savi|our pre&s;&s;eth by mo&s;t weighty Rea&s;ons, or Motives:
<PB N="2" REF="004390_0007_100D4DB68B5E6A68">The fir&s;t of which is taken from the Difficulty of getting to Heaven, and the Fewne&s;s of tho&s;e that &s;hall be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Conver&s;ion, Repentance, Faith and Holine&s;s, Self-denial and Cro&s;s-bearing, the Yoke of O|bedience, and Burden of Afflictions are all hard to Fle&s;h and Blood! Many may run, few will win the Prize, many more will &s;cuffle and beat the Air, than will overcome. <HI>Strive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate; for many I &s;ay unto you, will &s;eek to enter in, and &s;hall not be able,</HI> ver. 24. Many &s;ecure Sinners are awakened and &s;tirred up by the Fear of Hell or Hope of Heaven, to take &s;ome Pains, for&s;ake divers Lu&s;ts, and do many Things; but for want of &s;triving more earne&s;tly, and holding out to the End, they lo&s;e all their Labour: <HI>For the Kingdom of Heaven &s;uf|fereth Violence,</HI> and the Violent take it by Force: Then only &s;hall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord, We mu&s;t &s;trive again&s;t, and beat our Way thro' many and mighty Oppo&s;i|tions; &s;trive, even unto an Agony! Not that our own Endeavours can bring us to Heaven: Grace and Glory are God's free Gift: yet this is the Way to the Kingdom. And 'twere as good &s;it|ting &s;till as to ri&s;e up and fall.</P>
<P>'Tis our own Salvation; we mu&s;t therefore work it out: Tis hard and hazardous; we mu&s;t there|fore work it out with Fear and Trembling. <HI>Many &s;hall &s;eek to enter in, and not be able;</HI> few then obtain what they &s;eek for: the more Rea&s;on have we to &s;trive. This is more expre&s;ly laid down, Mat. 7.13, 14. <HI>Enter ye in at the &s;trait Gate, for wide is the Gate, and broad is the Way
<PB N="3" REF="004390_0008_100D4DE477C4C778">that leadeth to De&s;truction; and many there be that go in thereat. Becau&s;e &s;trait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way which leadeth unto Life; and few there be that find it.</HI> We would not peri&s;h with an everla&s;ting De&s;truction, which is the End of the broad Way; in which many walk becau&s;e the Way is ea&s;ie: Let us then even croud and wedge in at the &s;trait Gate; and while Satan would improve it to di&s;courage us from &s;eeking, that there be &s;o few Finders; we &s;hould &s;trive &s;o much the more earne&s;tly to be of that &s;mall Number. Indeed, Whether <HI>few</HI> or <HI>many</HI> &s;hall be &s;aved, is not of &s;o much Con|cernment unto us, as that <HI>we</HI> be of the happy Number. This is the fir&s;t Rea&s;on or Motive, with which Chri&s;t does back and enforce his Ex|hortation: The &s;econd is taken from the Danger of neglecting to &s;eek in a finding Time, ver. 25. <HI>When once the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e is ri&s;en up, and hath &s;hut to the Door, and ye begin to &s;tand without, and to knock at the Door, &s;aying, Lord, Lord, Open unto us; and be &s;hall an&s;wer and &s;ay unto you, I know you not whence you are.</HI> This Argument &s;eems to be built on &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition as this; An Hou&s;holder invites many Strangers to eat and drink at his Table, or lodge in his Hou&s;e; warn|ing them to be &s;ure that they come in Sea&s;on; a&s;&s;uring them that if they do &s;o, his Door &s;hall be open to them; they &s;hall have a kind Wel|come, and be entertained after the be&s;t Sort; The Gue&s;ts come in one after another, and are received; but at length Meal-time, or Bed-time comes; the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e and Fea&s;t goes him&s;elf, &s;huts fa&s;t the Door, and keeps out all
<PB N="4" REF="004390_0009_100D4DB8914BF698">who came not in Sea&s;on: they &s;hall be forced to &s;tand without; if they knock there's no open|ing; whatever Pleas they make all is in vain: they &s;hould have been admitted had they come &s;ooner; but now it's too late; the Door is &s;hut. <HI>Then &s;hall they call on me, but I will not an&s;wer; they &s;hall &s;eek me early</HI> (i. e. earne&s;tly) <HI>but &s;hall not find me. O that thou had&s;t known, at lea&s;t in this thy Day, the Things of thy Peace; but now they are hidden from thine Eyes.</HI> The fooli&s;h Vir|gins came to the Wedding-chamber Door; but out of Sea&s;on; they knock'd, and call'd, and begg'd for Entrance, but 'twas too late. This brings us to the third and la&s;t Argument, which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour u&s;es, in this Place, to per|&s;wade his Hearers unto the forementioned indi&s;|pen&s;ible Duty of &s;triving, and nece&s;&s;ary Means of obtaining Life and Happine&s;s; this is taken from the dreadful Aggravations of their Exclu|&s;ion, who &s;hall neglect to &s;eek and &s;trive, in Sea|&s;on and in Earne&s;t. Now the&s;e aggravating Cir|cum&s;tances of being &s;hut out, are reduceable to three or four Heads.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, They &s;hall be willing then to enter into Life on any Terms; Lord, Lord, Open to us; yet no An&s;wer but what Bars the Door already &s;hut again&s;t them: I know you not whence you are. Le&s;s Importunity would have obtained be|fore; but 'tis utterly in vain now: How dread|ful, how intolerable is this!</P>
<P>As I have read of a covetous Man who, labour|ing of a dangerous Malady, &s;ent for a Surgeon, and would know for how much Money, he would undertake his Cure; but not liking his
<PB N="5" REF="004390_0010_100D4DE62F3F5A28">Demands, lets him go: at length, his Di&s;temper prevailing, he &s;ends again, and offers the full Sum; now double Money is demanded; the wretched Mi&s;er is loth to go to the Co&s;t; neg|lects till Extremity force him to open all his Trea|&s;ures; but then it's too late; his Sore is incu|rable. The Application is ea&s;y.</P>
<P>You've read the Example of <HI>E&s;au,</HI> and know how that (having de&s;pi&s;ed his Birth-right) af|terwards, when he would have inherited the Ble&s;&s;ing, he was rejected; and found no Place of Repentance, tho' he &s;ought it carefully with Tears.</P>
<P>Again, They &s;hall plead their Admi&s;&s;ion to Church-fellow&s;hip, Enjoyment of Go&s;pel Privi|ledges, attending on the Means of Grace, per|forming the Duties of Religions, <HI>ver.</HI> 26 <HI>We have eaten and drunk in thy Pre&s;ence; and thou ha&s;t taught in our Streets.</HI> In &s;uch a Plea is plain|ly implied their confident Hopes of Acceptance with God, and a Place among the Ble&s;&s;ed: But now to have their Suit rejected, their Pleas all invalidated, and their rai&s;ed Expectations eter|nally di&s;appointed, (ver. 27. <HI>But he &s;hall &s;ay, I tell you, I know you not whence you are; Depart from me all ye Workers of Iniquity.</HI>) How intolera|ble is this! To live among the Saints, and pa&s;s for one, not only in our own, but in the cha|ritable Opinion of many others, while we live, and when we come to die,&mdash; yet at la&s;t, and after all to be led forth with the Workers of Ini|quity! This is another Aggravation of the Go&s;|pel-Sinners Condemnation.</P>
<P>Moreover, The Extremity of their Torment, who peri&s;h under the Go&s;pel, is &s;et forth in the
<PB N="6" REF="004390_0011_100D4DBA501DE290">Words of our Text; <HI>There &s;hall be Weeping and Gna&s;hing of Teeth.</HI>&mdash; The&s;e &s;ame Expre&s;&s;ions are u&s;ed no le&s;s than &s;ix or &s;even Times over by one Evangeli&s;t, <HI>Mat.</HI> 8.12. and 13.42, 50. and 22.13, 24, 51. and 25.30.

Tis true, the Torment of the Damn|ed does con&s;i&s;t e&s;&s;entially, in their Separation from infinite Goodne&s;s; and the immediate Im|pre&s;&s;ions of the Almighty's Wrath: but there &s;hall be certain biting Ingredients in their Cup, that will make the Wormwood and Gall thereof yet more bitter; among which this in the Text is not the lea&s;t; <HI>Ye &s;hall &s;ee</HI> Abraham, I&s;aac <HI>and</HI> Jacob, <HI>and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and you your &s;elves thru&s;t out.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Words were &s;poken by Chri&s;t to his own Nation the Seed of <HI>Abraham;</HI> and they built much on their Relation to him: <HI>We have</HI> Abraham <HI>to our Father.</HI>&mdash; Chri&s;t knew their in|ward Thoughts and Dependence; Luke 3.8. <HI>Begin not to &s;ay within your &s;elves, We have</HI> Abra|ham <HI>to our Father; for I &s;ay unto you that God is able, of the&s;e Stones, to rai&s;e up Children unto</HI> Abra|ham. The believing Gentiles are now the &s;piritual Children of <HI>Abraham:</HI> the natural Branches were broken off, that we, who are by Nature of the wild Olive, might be graffed into the Stock of <HI>Abraham's</HI> Covenant. But we are fallen into the fourth and la&s;t Aggravation of their Condemnation, who were Unbelievers of the <HI>Jews, viz.</HI> that Sinners of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> &s;hould be received in their Room! v. 29, 30. <HI>And they

But to return; The&s;e Words (as was &s;aid) were uttered by our Lord to the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> by natural Generation; and he tells them what their carnal Confidence in external Priviledges was like to come to; You &s;hall &s;ee <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and all the Prophets; &mdash; 'Tis true, Their Father <HI>Abraham</HI> was Dead, and the Prophets were Dead, as to Men, but not as to God; foor thus our Saviour argues for the Re&s;ur|rection again&s;t the Sadducees, Mat. 22.32. <HI>I am the God of</HI> Abraham, <HI>&amp;c. God is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living.</HI> As &s;ure as Chri&s;t died and ro&s;e again, &s;o &s;ure all that Sleep in Ju&s;us, will God bring with him, 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 4.14.

This wicked One is &s;till pre&s;ent with us while we hear the Word of the Kingdom; and has a thou&s;and Ways to hinder our profit|ing thereby; when he cannot divert us from attending thereon.

It's true, the revelation of Heaven's Glory does little affect chri&s;tle&s;s Sinners now, becau&s;e of their great Darkne&s;s and Infidelity. As the ungo&s;pel|lized World know nothing of the holy City; &s;o all unconverted Chri&s;tians are great Strangers to that future, glorious State. Carnal Profe&s;&s;ors may &s;peak much about Heaven; and Men of Learn|ing write whole Volumns concerning the State of the Ble&s;&s;ed in the other World; but they know nothing experimentally of the matter as holy Souls do. A Day in God's Courts, or one Hour's Com|munion with Chri&s;t at his Table; Yea, a quarter of an Hour's Fellow&s;hip of the Spirit, in Clo&s;et Prayer, or Evening Meditation, does give the mo&s;t illiterate true Believer to under&s;tand more of Heaven, than many Years &s;tudy of the acute&s;t Doctor, from who&s;e carnal Wi&s;dom the&s;e Things are hid.</P>
<P>Holy Mr. <HI>Flavel</HI> profe&s;s'd, that he knew more of the Life of Heaven, by the ravi&s;hing Foreta&s;tes he had of Glory, in one &s;olitary Journey in the way of divine Meditation, than ever he learned by all the Books he had read, and Di&s;cour&s;es he had entertained about it.</P>
<P>Heaven con&s;i&s;ts mainly in the &s;atisfaction of holy De&s;ires and Longings, which the un&s;anctified know nothing of. They may think it a good Thing, and great, to be equal to Angels, in Ho|nours and Delights; To be free from Pain, Want, Labour, Care and Fear; and to be filled with Joy; but what that Joy is, they apprehend not; and the Nature and Ta&s;te of the Water of Life, they are wholly Strangers to: 1 Cor. 2.14. <HI>But the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the

<P>More Particularly: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Damned in Hell have the fulle&s;t. Knowledge that can be, by Sen&s;e and Experience, of that Evil which the Saints are delivered from. Now herein con&s;i&s;ts a great Part of the Saints Happine&s;s in Heaven: for if there be Pain of Lo&s;s as well as Sen&s;e in the Damned, there mu&s;t be a proportionable Joy of Deliverance, as well as Fruition, in the Saved. A very great Part, no doubt, of the ravi&s;hing Joy and Exta&s;ies of Love, that, the glorifyed are tran&s;ported with, ari&s;es from the Con&s;ideration of what they are perfectly and for ever &s;aved from; even the Pains of Hell, and the Bla&s;phemies of the Dam|ned; &s;ome Ta&s;te of which they had under the
<PB N="39" REF="004390_0044_100D4E0AAFD773A8">Spirit of Bondage, and from Satan's fiery Darts; (yea, and out of their own Hearts al&s;o have proceeded Bla&s;phemies;) and more is under&s;tood of the Power of God's Anger, in the State of perfect Knowledge; yet there can be no humane Knowledge like that of Experience: The Dam|ned have rea&s;on to know what a Felicity it would be to be &s;aved from Wrath; and are now con|vinced, by mo&s;t cogent Arguments, that Heaven, con&s;idered only as it is de&s;cribed, Rev. 21.4. <HI>And God &s;hall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes; and there &s;hall be no more Death, neither Sorrow, nor Crying; neither &s;hall there be any more Pain;</HI> it was well worth the &s;eeking. Thus the Dam|ned mu&s;t needs have mo&s;t large and quick Ap|prehen&s;ions of one Part of the Saints Happine&s;s in Heaven. As the &s;aved be&s;t know, what lo&s;t Souls have lo&s;t with their Souls; &s;o, on the con|trary, as was &s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Damned will for ever remem|ber what they &s;hall have &s;een and heard, of the beginning of the Saints Happine&s;s, after the Re|&s;urrection, before their final Separation. With what beautiful, &s;hining, glorious Bodies they are rai&s;ed: what Joy appears in their Countenance: how congratulated by Angels and Fellow Saints: what dear Love Chri&s;t expre&s;&s;es to them; and what Honour he does vi&s;ibly and openly put upon them; while they are caught up in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air, and to &s;it at his right Hand, as A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors in Judgment 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 4.17. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.2, 3.

<P>And then, <HI>Thirdly;</HI> Their Under&s;tandings will be greatly inlarged to take in, who can tell what Ideas of Heaven's Glory, and the Saints Felicity, for their own endle&s;s Vexation. If the Un&s;anctified may, by common Illumination, know &s;omething of the Powers of the World to come, here, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.5. Hereafter (though they &s;hall ta&s;te nothing of the Goodne&s;s of God's Word pa&s;t, yet) they &s;hall know more of the World then come, un&s;peaka|bly more than now can enter into their Hears to
<PB N="41" REF="004390_0046_100D4E0CC8F17D60">conceive. As their Bodies &s;hall be &s;trengthned to endure the hotte&s;t Fire of God's burning Wrath, without con&s;uming a jot; &s;o their Ap|prehen&s;ions may be proportionably inlarged, a|bove what they now can reach unto; and their Memories may be &s;trengthned to recal and retain every aggravating Circum&s;tance of all their Sin on Earth, Luk. 16.25. <HI>Son Remember,</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>We know that Thought and Con&s;ideration is e&s;&s;ential to the humane Nature; and it is known, by univer&s;al Experience, that by this natural Power of the Soul, we are able to bring Things out of Sight, and at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance; yea, Things pa&s;t or future, and purely &s;piritual too (as well, though not &s;o ea&s;ily as the Objects of Sen&s;e) into plain View as it were before our Eyes; or as if &s;uch Things were &s;ounding in our Ears. Thus, when a Man is on a de&s;olate I&s;land at Sea, or clo&s;e Pri&s;oner in a &s;trange Land; how &s;en&s;ibly does he repre&s;ent to him&s;elf the happy Freedom of others, in their own beloved Coun|try, commodious Habitations, with Meat and Drink to the full, and change of Raiment; warm Beds; their Wives with them, and Children a|bout them; while him&s;elf is de&s;titute of all the&s;e Comforts; and this makes his Iron Fetters to eat into his very Soul: how much more in the Ca&s;e before us, in which not only is the di&s;|proportion a million Times greater, but the Capa|city al&s;o of apprehending, comparing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hall be inconceiveably inlarged; and the Damned, as was &s;aid, have nothing to divert them from a con|&s;tant, deep and fixed Meditation on this very Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="004390_0047_100D4DDF44B185D8">
It remains yet to be con&s;idered, more di&s;tinct|ly, how the&s;e Apprehen&s;ions of the Damned in Hell, concerning the Saints Happine&s;s in Heaven, &s;hall aggravate their own eternal Mi&s;ery. That their Mi&s;ery &s;hall be Eternal is evident from many plain Scriptures, that have been already mentioned; and it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;o, for in Hell God will not puni&s;h them le&s;s than their Iniquities de&s;erve, which are infinite, in regard of the Object again&s;t whom they are committed: Now it being impo&s;&s;ible that a finite Creature &s;hould, in the longe&s;t &s;pace of Time, make full Satisfaction to an infinite GOD, (as Chri&s;t, who was an infinite Per&s;on, did for the Elect) there|fore their Puni&s;hment mu&s;t be infinite in Dura|tion: be&s;ides, the earne&s;t Wi&s;h, and hearty De|&s;ire of every Bond-&s;lave of Satan is, that he might live for ever on Earth, in Health, Honour and Pro&s;perity, that &s;o he might fulfil the De&s;ires of the Fle&s;h and the Mind, (<HI>i. e.</HI> that he might Sin) for ever. So that there is a Sort of Infinite|ne&s;s in the Evil of Sin: Nothing indeed, if we &s;peak ab&s;olutely, can be infinitely Evil: there is but one Infinite, and he is infinitely Good: Yet, Reprobates are as it were guilty of an infinite Evil; both as Sin is contrary to the Nature, Will and Honour of a Being, infinite in Great|ne&s;s and Goodne&s;s, Equity and Holine&s;s; and al&s;o, in that there is a Di&s;po&s;ition to Sin, in &s;uch as are not changed, that will never cea&s;e; but if the Sinner were under a I aw to Eternity, he would be a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or to Eternity; if God &s;hould heap Mercies on him to Eternity, he would abu&s;e them to Eternity. Now the lea&s;t
<PB N="43" REF="004390_0048_100D4E0EE1453258">Degree of Torment, to la&s;t for ever, is horrible to think of! Such as never had &s;ufficient Means of Salvation; that never once rebelled again&s;t the Light of the Go&s;pel, though (dying Chri&s;t|le&s;s) their Puni&s;hment will be more tolerable than ours if we die in Unbelief; yet to lie in the &s;ofte&s;t Fire for ever, how Di&s;mal! Yea, if it were but to undergo the grievous Pain of a Tooth, for ever and for ever, it would tire out the long|e&s;t Patience!

<P N="2">(2) Had they been per&s;waded that they were elected; yet, their blind, proud, and ba&s;e Hearts would have oppo&s;ed an holy JESUS, a crucifyed Saviour; and rejected him with Contempt. Many of the Jews called <HI>Abraham</HI> their Father; yea, they boa&s;ted that God was their Father; and doubted not but he had cho&s;en them, and had &s;et his Love upon them; yet could they not by any Means, no not by Miracles be per&s;waded to be|lieve on Chri&s;t, <HI>Job.</HI> 8.39, 41, 47, 59, <HI>&amp;</HI> 9 13, <HI>to</HI>

<P N="3">(3.) Many of them that peri&s;h, are &s;uch as al|ways denied and hated the Doctrine of per&s;onal Election from Eternity; and were for the Doctrine of Free-Will, as it &s;tands in oppo&s;ition to that of Free-Grace; holding that God de&s;ires the Salva|tion of all that have the Go&s;pel alike; that Chri&s;t died for them all, one as much as another; and that the Spirit &s;trives no le&s;s with &s;uch as finally re&s;i&s;t him, than with them that comply with his Motions, &s;o as to Repent and Believe the Go&s;|pel.

<P>It is not now my Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o much to confute the erroneous, as to &s;atisfy the Weak, how the Doctrine of Election, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (which pa&s;&s;es by the greate&s;t Part, even of &s;uch as live under the Go&s;pel) can &s;tand with their peri&s;hing thro' their own Default: And I have gained one Point further towards their Satisfaction, when they &s;hall &s;ee, how that &s;uch as are for univer&s;al Redemp|tion, and profe&s;s to believe that God has given to them (and all) Power &s;ufficient, in the u&s;e of Means, to obtain Salvation; if yet they mi&s;s of their Expectation, and be found Enemies to Chri&s;t at la&s;t, they mu&s;t needs be &s;peechle&s;s, and bear the Blame of their Self-De&s;truction for ever. For what can they &s;ay, when the final Sentence is pa&s;&s;ed, why it &s;hould not be executed upon them? Why did they not turn and live; &s;ince they boa&s;ted of a Power to do it? Or rather, Why did they not acknowledge they had none, and go to Chri&s;t for it, who never rejected any that, lamenting their Ignorance, Impotence, En|mity and utter Unworthine&s;s, came a begging to him for Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification and Redemption.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) It is true, &s;uch as peri&s;h were not given to Chri&s;t to be redeemed and &s;aved; and &s;o, not irre&s;i&s;tibly drawn to him. Joh. 6.37. <HI>All that the Father giveth me, &s;hall come to me.</HI> But who, and what was it that drave them away from

Was it becau&s;e they were not loved by God, and cho&s;en in Chri&s;t, before the Foun|dation of the World? No; for the Elect hated the Lord before Conver&s;ion. Was it becau&s;e mo&s;t of them had never &s;een Chri&s;t?

<P N="5">(5) What, though Sinners have no Power to Repent and Believe the Go&s;pel, with &s;uch a Faith as works by Love; yet they that peri&s;h are without Excu&s;e, in that it was not only through Man's wilful Apo&s;tacy from God, that he came to need a Saviour (Eccl. 7.29. <HI>God made Man upright: but he hath &s;ought out many Inventions</HI>) which he could never oblige God to provide for him: but it is al&s;o the Reprobate's own Fault that he heaps up actual Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of his own, for which he needs Repentance; and when he has done, he is &s;o far from repenting heartily of his Sins, that he either hates to be reformed, or traiterou&s;ly &s;ets up his external, partial Reformation in the Saviour's Throne. Who&s;e Fault was it that <HI>Adam</HI> finned? And whence came the Sinner's corrupt Nature: that Ignorance and Enmity, which is the Root of all the Unbelief,
<PB N="79" REF="004390_0084_100D4E6B97EC8AD0">Di&s;obedience and Impenitency therein, for which they are de&s;ervedly puni&s;hed? Was any Violence offered to the pure Will of Man at fir&s;t? And does not his corrupt Will act freely &s;till? Did the Creator, or any Creature force the Hands of our fir&s;t Parents to the Tree of Knowledge; or that forbidden Fruit into their Mouths? And having lo&s;t their original Rectitude, they could not convey it to their Po&s;terity. Or, is the uni|ver&s;al Law of Nature unju&s;t; that every &s;ort of Creature &s;hould propagate it's Kind, in it's own Likene&s;s? <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.12, 21, <HI>to</HI> 28. compar'd with Chap. 5.3. <HI>Adam begat a Son in his own Likene&s;s, after his Image: i. e.</HI> as he was a Man, and as he was a Sinner. Now, if God made Man in his own Image, after his own Likene&s;s; and when he comes to judge him, he finds him in Satan's Likene&s;s, with the very Image of the Devil up|on him, <HI>Go, ye cur&s;ed, into Everla&s;ting Fire, pre|pared for the Devil and his Angels,</HI> will be no un|righteous Sentence; for <HI>I&s;rael</HI> hath de&s;troyed him&s;elf fir&s;t; and then refu&s;ed Help through Chri&s;t. <HI>Reader,</HI> If thou art not found thus guil|ty at la&s;t, thou &s;halt not be condemned.</P>
<P N="6">(6) I might appeal to your own Experience, whom the Spirit has convinc'd of Sin; whether you did not &s;ee and know it to be your own Fault that you had finned again&s;t God; and doubly &s;o, that you had rejected Chri&s;t's Authority, as your rightful Lord and King, and his Mercy, as your only Saviour from Sin and Wrath. Suppo&s;e, you that are effectually Called had only heard the external Sound of the Go&s;pel, and experienced only a common Work of the Spirit; (thus many
<PB N="80" REF="004390_0085_100D4E37E1A4DAA0">are called, who are not cho&s;en, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22.14) had you not peri&s;hed through your own Default? What Thoughts had you of your &s;elves, when you were under the humbling, preparatory Work of the Spirit of Bondage? Did you not plainly &s;ee it to be your own Fault that you had finned, and not repented? Were you not brought (tho' it may be, it was long fir&s;t) to ju&s;tify God if he &s;hould ca&s;t you off for ever, becau&s;e you had for&s;aken Him? Did you not acknowledge, from the bottom of your Hearts, that if God &s;hould deny you his Grace, and leave you to your &s;elves, he could do you no Wrong? Now, either you did wrong in thus judging your &s;elves, or God does right in condemning others, that neither can nor will believe and repent; but are condemned to die, not becau&s;e they <HI>cannot,</HI> but becau&s;e they <HI>will not</HI> turn and live. Is it not ju&s;t, that the Soul which Sins &s;hould die and peri&s;h, except he repent?

The higher they were rai&s;ed by GOD, in com|mon Gifts of the Spirit; by Men, in charitable Expre&s;&s;ions, and real Affection, thro' mi&s;take; and by them&s;elves, through Satan's &s;trong De|lu&s;ions, in glorious Expectations, the deeper will they fall.

Such as heave had the Un&s;oundne&s;s of their Hopes for Heaven, again and again, plainly di&s;covered; in&s;omuch that their fal&s;e Peace has been greatly di&s;turbed; and at Times, they have been even convinced that their State and Condition was bad; that they were yet in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s and in the Bonds of Iniquity; that another Manner of Work mu&s;t pa&s;s on them, or they peri&s;h for ever. Yet, for all this, like
<PB N="101" REF="004390_0106_100D7B5B9F8B7C38">fool-hardy Wretches, they have &s;hut their Eyes again&s;t this Light of Conviction, (that might have prov'd the Dawning of &s;ound Conver&s;ion, and eternal Salvation to them;) and ventured on over the Precipice, chu&s;ing the Terrors of the Second-Death, rather than the Pangs of the New-Birth; and to be at the Co&s;t of laying a new Foundation. Sometimes they have thought they would let go their fal&s;e Hold; but then, finding them&s;elves de&s;titute of any Footing, fall|ing and &s;inking, and fearing they &s;hould be da&s;h|ed in Pices or drowned, they mu&s;t catch hold of &s;omething; &s;ome where they mu&s;t fa&s;ten; De&s;|pair is dreadful! And being ignorant of the Way of Salvation, by believing in him that ju&s;tifies the Ungodly, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.5. (which indeed is a Mi&s;|tery, hidden from the greate&s;t Part of Profe&s;&s;ors) they mu&s;t (I &s;ay) catch hold &s;ome where, as drowning Men; and the rotten Stick of &s;elf|righteous Performances is what comes next to Hand, and they can reach no further: If they think, now they will come off from Self and Duties, and lean on CHRIST only, 'tis with a Faith of their own forging; they do but re|pair the old Hou&s;e, which mu&s;t be pulled down to the Ground, and removed, every Stick of it, and the Foundation ripped up, that they may be created a new, in Chri&s;t Je&s;s to good Works: founded on him, and built up in him: But, Oh! how aver&s;e are our old Covenant Hearts from this new and living Way, when opened in the Go&s;pel! Salvation by Works, a Di&s;po|&s;ition to work for Wages and earn Heaven, was the fir&s;t Liquor that was put into the Ve&s;&s;el of

<P>Thus, I have diverted a little, to &s;hew you one main Cau&s;e of that extreme Difficulty Mini&s;|ters find, in removing Men from their old, fal&s;e Foundations: And when they have done all, Multitudes will hold fa&s;t their own Self-Deceiv|ings. They will put new Patches on the old, ragged Garment; they will &s;eem to mend their Pace; but 'tis in the old, broad, beaten Path. Yea (to retun) they will &s;hut their Eyes (as was &s;aid) again&s;t the plaine&s;t Conviction; and ven|ture on in a Way, they are &s;o oft and faithfully told, will end in their &s;hameful and intolerable Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Thus the Damned in Hell, e&s;pecially &s;uch as peri&s;h from under the Go&s;pel, and peculiarly &s;ome Sorts of Go&s;pel Sinners that have been mentioned, &s;hall have &s;uch Apprehen&s;ions of the Saints Happine&s;s in Heaven, as will dreadfully aggravate their own eternal Mi&s;ery.</P>

If, after the mo&s;t laborious and critical Search, we find a Grain of true Grace, we &s;hall have more Cau&s;e of Joy, than if we had found a Wedge of Gold; Prov. 3.13, 14, 15. <HI>Happy is the Man that findeth Wi&s;dom, (i. e.</HI> true &s;aving Grace) <HI>For the Merchandize of it is better than the Merchandize of Silver, and the Gain thereof than fine Gold: It is more precious than Rubies; and all the Things thou can&s;t de&s;ire cannot be compared to it.</HI> And if, on Trial, our pre&s;ent State appear to be un&s;ound, we have then the mo&s;t happy Sea&s;on, perhaps, that ever we had in our Life Time, to make our &s;elves for ever: For, what is it that undoes a great Part of tho&s;e who peri&s;h from under the Go&s;pel, but a fal&s;e Hope? <HI>Job</HI> 27.8. What is the Hope of the Hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when God taketh away his Soul? You are willing in tem|poral Ca&s;es to know the wor&s;t: When travel|ling, to be told if you take a wrong Way, be|fore you have utterly lo&s;t your &s;elf, and your Feet &s;tumble upon the dark Mountains: If go|ing to Law, you intreat your Coun&s;eller not to flatter you with vain Hopes; but to tell you the wor&s;t you may expect, if you proceed.

Nor can we &s;ay that every one who is willing to be tried is therefore upright of Heart; for many have a &s;trong Confidence of their good E&s;tate, though groundle&s;s; now, the&s;e, re&s;olving what to judge before Hand, may boldly come to the Trial. And then, the Spirit of Conviction can make an elect Soul (at pre|&s;ent on a fal&s;e Foundation) willing to come to the Trial, in order to his Conver&s;ion and Sal|vation.

<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) That a &s;incere Chri&s;tian may much &s;ooner and more ea&s;ily di&s;cover his Sincerity, than a Formali&s;t can his Hypocri&s;y. It mu&s;t needs be &s;o, ordinarily; for the Convert knows what it is to be an Hypocrite: He can tell how his Heart &s;tood affected in his natural State; and now he can compare former with pre&s;ent Expe|riences.
<PB N="120" REF="004390_0125_100D7B9EDD1AAF00">Moreover, It is of the Nature of Light to make manife&s;t; <HI>Once were ye Darkne&s;s,</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) <HI>but now ye are Light in the Lord.</HI> And then, the Spirit of Truth and Re|velation dwells in them, and that partly for this End, 1 Cor. 2.12. <HI>Now we have received, not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the Things that are freely given us of God.</HI> Whereas &s;upernatural Things are incomprehen&s;ible by the natural Man; what ever common Light and Knowledge he may have: So that when he comes to examine his State, he knows not what he is to look for: if he be told never &s;o plainly, he may ea&s;ily mi&s;|take: If he looks into his Heart, it is like a dark Dungeon, where you may look long enough, and grope in vain for the brighte&s;t Object, if it be very &s;mall; though it would be very plain by the lea&s;t Candle-Light: Not that there is any Grace, by the Light of the Noon-Day Sun, to be di&s;covered in his Heart; yet there is pre|vailing Enmity again&s;t Chri&s;t, and the Way of Salvation by a Self-denying Faith in him; and yet he cannot &s;ee it by rea&s;on of Darkne&s;s. He hates his Brother, becau&s;e of the Image of Chri&s;t that he bears; yet he neither will &s;ee it, nor can he, &s;o as the gracious Soul may &s;ee and feel his Love to the precious Image of Chri&s;t, where|ever he &s;ees it; though it were in the meane&s;t Negro-Slave; or in one that, through mi&s;take, may misjudge and di&s;affect him. The Children of this World are, ordinarily, wi&s;er than the Children of Light, in earthly Matters; but &s;et them on &s;uch a Work, as I am now &s;peaking
<PB N="121" REF="004390_0126_100D7BA1DE1B8500">of, and they are all in Confu&s;ion.

And how &s;hall I know whether my Heart be right with God?</HI> And herein he had a great Advantage for the Di&s;co|very of his Sincerity; whiles the fal&s;e Heart is under all Manner of Di&s;advantages; yet GOD can di&s;cover him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) In this U&s;e, we are not trying the Quan|tity of Grace, with Scales and Weights or Mea&s;ures; but the Quality of it, as with a Touch-Stone. One &s;ingle Grain of Gold is as truly Gold as a Talent. Indeed, it's no good Sign, when we are always enquiring after the &s;inalle&s;t Mea&s;ure of true Grace: And if we de|&s;ire no more Grace than ju&s;t to &s;ave us from Hell, and for no higher End, we &s;hall never ge to Heaven: Neverthele&s;s, we mu&s;t fir&s;t bring our Grace to the Touch-Stone, to try of what Kind it is; and then, after we have found it true; and that we are new born; and in the narrow Way; we mu&s;t, from Time to Time, weigh and mea&s;ure our Increa&s;e, Stature and Progre&s;s.</ITEM>

The Unbeliever &s;ins in praying, becau&s;e he prays not aright; but he that omits Prayer, is guilty of the &s;ame &s;inful Defect, in the want of a right Frame of Heart to pray; and then he omits a commanded Duty, (even <HI>Simon Magus</HI> was bid to pray) and &s;o is doubly guilty.

Either they have ne|ver been gro&s;ly and vi&s;ibly bad; or el&s;e they have been awakned and reformed.

<P>I will ju&s;t hint at &s;ome Things, for our Di|rection and further Help in this great and diffi|cult Work; and &s;o pa&s;s on to another U&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, We mu&s;t know that Conver&s;ion is taken either actively or pa&s;&s;ively. Sometimes we are commanded to convert our&s;elves, and turn from Sin to God; to repent and be converted, that our Sins may be blotted out; to make us a new Heart and a new Spirit, ca&s;ting away all our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, le&s;t we die; and it is our unque&s;|tionable Duty to cea&s;e to do Evil, and learn to do well; yet, the&s;e Injunctions do not &s;uppo&s;e that it is in our Power to change our own Hearts: the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> may as &s;oon change his Skin: They expre&s;s our Duty, and convict us of Guilt in our Non-performance, and bring us to our Knees, as <HI>Ephraim,</HI> Jer. 31.18, 19. <HI>I have &s;urely heard</HI> Ephraim <HI>bemoaning him&s;elf,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned. Surely, after that I was turned I repented; and after that I was in&s;tructed, I &s;mote upon my Thigh; I was a&s;hamed, yea even confounded,</HI> &amp;c. We are wholly pa&s;&s;ive, when the Spirit of God takes away the Heart of Stone, and gives us an Heart of Fle&s;h; as you may &s;ee more at large, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.25, to 33. If Chri&s;t were not exalted to give Repentance as well as Pardon, how great a Prince &s;oever he might be e&s;teemed, he would be but an imperfect Saviour, Act. 5.31. <HI>You hath be quickned</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) <HI>who were dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins:</HI> Yea, he doubles it over again; <HI>Even when we were dead in Sins, hath be quickned us</HI> Eph. 2.1, 5. 'Tis
<PB N="145" REF="004390_0150_100D7CA10B9485F8">certain you mu&s;t turn or die; be converted or damned: 'Tis no le&s;s true, that you cannot convert your&s;elves: Cry to Heaven then, as <HI>Ephraim</HI> above mentioned, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.18, 19.</P>
<P>Secondly, Keep we our Eye on the Things that are not &s;een and are eternal; 2 Cor. 4.16, 18. <HI>We faint not,&mdash;while we look not at the Things which are &s;een; but at the Things which are not &s;een: for the Things which are &s;een are tem|poral, but the Things which are not &s;een, are eter|nal.</HI> This Re&s;pect to the Recompence of Re|ward, will make us chu&s;e rather to &s;uffer Afflic|tion with the People of God, than to enjoy the Plea&s;ures of Sin for a Sea&s;on, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.25. and then to &s;uffer the Vengeance of eternal Fire, <HI>Jude</HI> 7.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Minding &s;till our pre&s;ent Work from Day to Day; not perplexing our&s;elves with what is future, &s;o as to bring the Burden of many Days Work into one; yea it may be of a Life of Labour and Suffering, in a long Cour&s;e of active and pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, on our weak Shoulders all at once: This is the Way to do nothing: <HI>Sufficient to the Day is the</HI> (Labour and) <HI>Evil thereof.</HI> To-morrow will bring new Strength as well as Work: <HI>For God is able to make all Grace abound towards you; that ye always having All-&s;ufficiency, in all Things, may abound to every good Work,</HI> 2 Cor. 9.8. Mind we then our pre|&s;ent Work and Duty.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Yet we mu&s;t &s;it down and count the Co&s;t; <HI>Luke</HI> 14.28, 33. Le&s;t we prove like the Stony-Ground Hearers, <HI>Who, when they hear the Word, immediately receive it with Joy, and
<PB N="146" REF="004390_0151_100D7CA2B7F6D7E0">having no Root in them&s;elves, endure but for a Time: Afterward when Affliction or Per&s;ecution cri&s;eth for the Word's &s;ake, immediately they are o&s;&s;ended.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, Above all look we to Je&s;us, the Au|thor and Fini&s;her of our Faith; (<HI>Heb.</HI> 12.2.) as our great Prophet and Teacher; our High Prie&s;t, that has died to appea&s;e God's Anger, and lives to proeure his Favour for us; as our royal Ma&s;ter, to rule our Hearts entirely, and our whole Lives. And look we thus to him;
