<P>THE very &s;erious and awful <HI>Sermon</HI> here pre&s;ented to the <HI>Reader,</HI> &s;eems to have been prepar'd and utter'd, as it was al&s;o received, by a great and good <HI>Audience,</HI> under a reverend Regard to tho&s;e <HI>Words</HI> of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timo|thy, The&s;e things command and teach, let no man de&s;pi&s;e thy Youth.</HI> It is a plea&s;ure to every at|tentive <HI>Ob&s;erver</HI> in the Churches of <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> at this day, to &s;ee with what Gravity and <HI>Authority</HI> the <HI>ri&s;ing Mini&s;ters</HI> among us bring the &s;olemn Warnings and Me&s;&s;ages of CHRIST to his Churches, and with what <HI>Re|verence</HI> they are heard.

THis is the <HI>&s;econd E&s;&s;ay</HI> of the Rev. <HI>Author,</HI> &s;ince the great and terrible EARTHQUAKE, which &s;urpris'd and a&s;toni&s;h'd us on the 29 of <HI>October</HI> la&s;t, (the <HI>Tremors</HI> con&s;equent upon, which do continue to this Day) by the Will and Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD to fa&s;ten &s;utable <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> on the hearts of fearing <HI>Saints</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Sinners;</HI> and to <HI>warn</HI> tho&s;e of &s;ome more dreadful <HI>Stroke</HI> from the Hand of an angry GOD, who <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to continue in their provoking Impenitence.</P>
<P>AND certainly the whole Story of GOD'S righ|teous Judgments through the <HI>Holy Bible</HI> admo|ni&s;hes us of <HI>this,</HI> from the days of <HI>Noah</HI> to <HI>Je|ru&s;alem</HI>'s &s;econd de&s;olation.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Old World</HI> was endured and waited on by the <HI>Long &s;uffering</HI> of GOD, for how many Ages, under the Warnings of <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> but at la&s;t <HI>the Fountains of the great Deep were bro|ken up</HI> to overwhelm them. They &s;aw the <HI>Ark</HI> building, they were told <HI>for what,</HI> but they carele&s;ly and ob&s;tinately <HI>quenched the &s;triving</HI> SPIRIT of GOD; and the <HI>Flood</HI> came and drown'd 'em.</P>
<P><HI>Sodom</HI> afterward &s;inned again&s;t the <HI>Means of Grace</HI> in the Nei'bourhood of <HI>Melchi&s;edek</HI> and <HI>Abraham,</HI> and when they would not be reformed by the Doctrine, Example, and Re|proofs of tho&s;e <HI>Holy Men of</HI> GOD, but gave them&s;elves over to the fire of lu&s;t, the <HI>Fire of</HI> GOD fell upon them and con&s;umed them.</P>

So it far'd with the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Canaanites.

<P>THE Story of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> would be too long to enter on: What <HI>Means of Grace</HI> they were di&s;tingui&s;h'd with; How <HI>loth</HI> the HOLY ONE was to make them as <HI>Admah</HI> and &s;et them as <HI>Zeboim;</HI> How often <HI>his Repentings kindled together;</HI> But their Overthrow was at la&s;t with a Vengeance <HI>greater</HI> (as the <HI>Prophet</HI> tho't) <HI>than the Puni&s;hment of Sodom, which pe|ri&s;hed in a moment, and no hand &s;tayed on her.</HI></P>
<P>WE now are like In&s;tances and Monuments of the <HI>Patience</HI> and Long&s;uffering of CHRIST, &s;triving with us by his awakening SPIRIT, un|der the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> of his Word, and the <HI>Judg|ments</HI> of his Providence; And becau&s;e the common and <HI>ordinary Means</HI> have had &s;o little power and effect on us, GOD has u&s;ed <HI>One</HI> al|together <HI>new</HI> and extraordinary. He hath <HI>roar'd out of Zion</HI> in a way that we never heard before; even out of the <HI>bowels</HI> of the Earth, and as from the very <HI>belly of hell,</HI> we have heard his terrible <HI>Voice;</HI> like <HI>the Trum|pet from the burning and &s;haking Mountain,</HI> at

<P>IN all this <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> and great <HI>Ter|ror</HI> GOD pa&s;&s;es before Men in fearful EARTH|QUAKES; and the Meaning of his Providence is to awaken in guilty Sinners a <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>dread</HI> of his <HI>Wrath</HI> and righteous <HI>Judgment.</HI> This therefore is the <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of the following <HI>Sermon,</HI> which an&s;wers the Mind of the HOLY GHOST in the following <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Job 9.5, &amp;c. 26.11, &amp;c.

<HEAD><HI>THE</HI> Danger of not obeying the Voice of GOD.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ZEPHANIAH III. 2, 7, 8.</HI></BIBL>
<P>SHE obeyed not the Voice: &s;he received not Correction: &s;he tru&s;ted not in the LORD: &s;he drew not near to her GOD. I &s;aid, &s;urely thou wilt fear me: thou wilt receive In&s;truction: &s;o their dwellings &s;hould not be out off, how&s;oever I puni&s;hed them: but they ro&s;e early and cor|rupted all their doings. Therefore wait ye upon me, &s;aith the LORD, until the day that I ri&s;e up to the prey; for my Determination is &mdash; to pour upon them mine Indignation, even all my fierce Anger, for all the Earth &s;hall be devoured with the Fire of my Jealou&s;ie.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SINCE what&s;oever Things were written aforetime, were written for our Learn|ing, i. e. for our <HI>In&s;truction</HI> and <HI>Ad|monition</HI> on whom the Ends of the World are come, it certainly, greatly concerns us to hear Coun&s;el, and receive In&s;truction, by the Calls of GOD, and to take Warning
<PB N="2" REF="003015_0008_0FEF9F64D406BD50">by the Denunciations of His Wrath again&s;t His <HI>Covenant profe&s;&s;ing People</HI> in former Ages of the World: By doing &s;o, we &s;hould make a wi&s;e and good Improvement of the Lord's terrible Di&s;pen&s;ations towards them. Would to GOD, we might be enabled to &s;uch an Improve|ment of the &s;olemn Reproofs, and awful Warnings di&s;pen&s;ed by the holy <HI>Prophet,</HI> who &s;pake the Words I have now read: He was &s;ent from GOD, was authoriz'd and commi&s;|&s;ion'd by Him, to reprove &s;harply, all Ranks and Orders of Men, for their Sins; for their Idolatry, Apo&s;tacy, Forgetfulne&s;s of GOD, and their Duty, and the &s;inful Fa&s;hions of too many in their Habits, and the violent Op|pre&s;&s;ions of many, which with many other provoking Evils were found in the mid&s;t of them, and were abounding among them, for which they were threatned with &s;evere Pu|ni&s;hments, yea, and with an utter De&s;olation, with the like De&s;olation that had been brought on other Nations and People, not far from them; the&s;e terrible Examples the <HI>Prophet</HI> &s;ets before them, to move and excite them to con&s;ider, repent, and amend their Ways, and &s;o prevent the Infliction of threatned Judg|ments, which without &s;uch a Repentance and Reformation, would certainly, and &s;uddenly be brought upon them. The <HI>Prophet</HI> there|fore does mo&s;t affectionately exhort and urge them to Repentance, by the Examples of tho&s;e who&s;e Impenitence added to their Ini|quities ruin'd them.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003015_0008_0FEF9F64D406BD50">
BY many gracious Promi&s;es and Encourag|ments, He excites them to look and hope for Mercy, upon their hearkening to His Coun|&s;el, that He would then pre&s;erve a <HI>Remnant</HI> of them, amid&s;t all the wa&s;ting Calamities and Judgments, that &s;hould follow them, who &s;hould rejoice in the GOD of their Salvation, becau&s;e GOD would in the mid&s;t of Judgment remember Mercy for them.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of this <HI>Prophe&s;y</HI> is foretold the approaching De&s;olation of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem; I will utterly con&s;ume all Things from off the Land, &s;aith the Lord: I will con|&s;ume Man and Bea&s;t, I will al&s;o &s;tretch out mine Hand upon Judah, and upon all the Inha|bitants of Jeru&s;alem.</HI> It intimates that by &s;ome immediate and awful Stroke of His holy Hand, He would bring a dreadful De&s;truction upon them, and not only upon the idolatrous Wor|&s;hippers of the Ho&s;t of Heaven, but upon &s;uch as <HI>have turned back from the Lord, and tho&s;e that have not &s;ought the Lord the Lord, nor en|quired after Him:</HI> i. e. Such as have for&s;aken the Lord and His pure Wor&s;hip, or that have turned <HI>Athei&s;ts;</HI> in their Hearts &s;ay, and by their Practices declare, <HI>That there is no GOD,</HI> and therefore will not call upon His Name, nor &s;tir up them&s;elves to take hold of Him; &s;uch al&s;o are doom'd to De&s;truction.</P>
<P>THE Prophet then calls upon them in &s;uch awful Terms as the&s;e, <HI>Hold thy Peace at the Pre&s;ence of the Lord GOD, for the Day of the Lord is at Hand, And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s in

<P>HE further tells them, that it is high time to make GOD their Refuge, and repair to to Him as &s;uch; for their Neighbours as well as they &s;hould be de&s;troyed, there &s;hould therefore be no Refuge for them among their Neighbours, that therefore if they would not fear the Lord, who is terrible in His Do|ings, De&s;olation would quickly come upon them.</P>
