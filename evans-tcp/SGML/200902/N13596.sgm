<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>On the 26th ultimo a Committee of &s;ix Friends, by Appointment, waited on the Pre&s;ident of the Executive Council, and the Speaker of the General A&s;&s;embly, with Copies of the following Repre&s;entation, to reque&s;t the Favour of them to lay the &s;ame before each of the public Bo|dies at which they re&s;pectively pre&s;ided, which they obligingly undertook, and it is now print|ed for the U&s;e of the Members of our own Society, and the Information of others who are unacquainted with our religious Principles.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> and <HI>Executive Council,</HI> the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> of Penn&s;ylvania, and others whom it may concern:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The following REPRESENTATION, on Behalf of the People called QUAKERS,</P>
<P>SHEWETH,</P>
<P>THAT the outrages and violences committed on the pro|perty, and on divers of the per&s;ons, of the inhabitants of Philadelphia, of our religious &s;ociety, by companies of licentious
<PB N="2" REF="017167_0002_0FA073608B3C5F90">people parading the &s;treets, de&s;troying the windows and doors of our hou&s;es, breaking into and plundering &s;ome of them, on the evening of the 24th of la&s;t month, encrea&s;es the occa&s;ion of our pre&s;ent addre&s;s to you, who are in the exerci&s;e of the powers of Civil Government, which is in it&s;elf honorable, and originally in&s;tituted for the &s;upport of public peace and good order, and the pre&s;ervation of the ju&s;t rights of the people.</P>
<P>Although we believe that mo&s;t of you are not unacquainted with our religious principles in general, and the rea&s;ons of our di&s;&s;ent from other profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, in divers matters relating to faith and practice, yet as &s;uch riotous proceedings are &s;hame|ful to the Chri&s;tian name, and di&s;honorable to government, and many of us have &s;uffered great lo&s;s and damage, we apprehend it our duty to bring into your view the grounds of our not comply|ing with the vain modes of rejoicing, in which many indulge them&s;elves, as al&s;o for the information of others, who through mi&s;apprehen&s;ion or prejudice too freely attribute our conduct to ob&s;tinacy and a party-&s;pirit, and are thus prompted wrongfully to judge and condemn us.</P>
<P>It therefore appears to us requi&s;ite to put you and them in mind, that at the beginning of the Reformation, a few centuries pa&s;t, the day of the Lord gradually broke forth in divers nations of Europe, rai&s;ing up pious men to declare again&s;t the gro&s;s &s;u|per&s;titions and impo&s;itions, contrary to the nature and &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity, which for many ages had prevailed, and enabling them to &s;tand faithful, many of them even unto death, according to the di&s;coveries of duty made known to them, in that revival of Go&s;pel dawn on their minds. And in proce&s;s of time it plea&s;ed Almighty God further to cau&s;e his glorious day of light to advance, and the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s to &s;hine in great bright|ne&s;s, whereby not only the gro&s;s, but al&s;o the more &s;pecious, as
<PB N="3" REF="017167_0003_0FA073614BFE9268">well <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> branches of corruption, were manife&s;ted to our worthy ance&s;tors, which divine principle of light and truth we al&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>In <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> manife&s;tation of go&s;pel light they clearly &s;aw, and many of us are now al&s;o firmly convinced, among other important truths, that the lu&s;ts of ambition, avarice, envy, and emulation, from whence wars, &s;trife and contention about earthly things, pro|ceed, are the fruits of the depravity and corruption of the human heart, which mu&s;t be expelled and eradicated in the &s;piritual work of Chri&s;tian redemption; and they not only &s;aw that they mu&s;t cea&s;e from outward ho&s;tilities, but that their conver&s;ation and con|duct mu&s;t be con&s;i&s;tent with the doctrine and precepts of the go&s;pel. That as they could not join with others in &s;hedding the blood of their fellow-men, for whom Chri&s;t died, "and who came to &s;ave men's lives, and not to de&s;troy them;" neither could they unite in rejoicing for the advantages gained by &s;uch blood&s;hed. As they could not fight with the fighters, neither could they triumph with the conquerors; and therefore they were not to be prevailed upon to make a &s;hew of conformity in &s;uch rejoicings, by placing lights in any part of the fronts of their hou&s;es, or other compliances of the like nature and tenden|cy; well knowing the levity and folly attending &s;uch things to be incon&s;i&s;tent with religious gravity and &s;obriety, and with that godly fear and reverence, which ought at all times to dwell on the minds of tho&s;e who profe&s;s to be followers of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>It was likewi&s;e &s;hewed to them, in the &s;ame divine light, as well as by the doctrine of the holy &s;criptures, that the &s;ons of God were led by the &s;pirit of God, and that all voluntary humi|lity and will-wor&s;hip mu&s;t be laid a&s;ide by them, and therefore they could not &s;ubject them&s;elves in the wor&s;hip of Almighty
<PB N="4" REF="017167_0004_0FA073620AC9B418">God to the will and commands of men; and as they were re|deemed from in&s;incerity, they could not di&s;&s;emble by &s;eeming to conform, when in heart and &s;pirit they did not; and therefore continued to open their &s;hops, and follow their lawful occupa|tions, on days appointed by human authority for the ob&s;ervation of public <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, fea&s;ts, and thank&s;givings, as u&s;ual on other days. This was their con&s;tant con&s;cientious practice, that they might &s;tand clear in the di&s;charge of their duty towards God, and with intent that others, through their example, might be induced to reflect upon the vanity and impropriety of tho&s;e ob&s;ervances and tumults, and their incoherence with the inward life, &s;pirit and virtue, of true religion, and Chri&s;tian &s;obriety.</P>
<P>And notwith&s;tanding they were charged with being actuated by a &s;pirit of &s;ingularity, ob&s;tinacy, and a de&s;ire to be contrary to others, yet they demon&s;trated that in what&s;oever they could comply, agreeable to good con&s;cience, they were ready to do it. Thus they concurred with the propriety and decency of other profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, in appropriating the fir&s;t day of the week for the performance of public wor&s;hip, believing it al&s;o to be their duty to &s;u&s;pend their attention to their outward concerns on other days, and to meet often together, according to the practice of the primitive Chri&s;tians, for the like pious purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is not from imitation, or for the &s;upport of ancient cu&s;tom, but from a conviction of judgment, that we are led into the &s;ame practice with our ance&s;tors; being firmly per&s;uaded that the holy &s;pirit will, in like manner, lead and guide &s;uch who are faithful to its dictates, in their conduct and conver&s;ation among men, and e&s;pecially in matters of faith and wor&s;hip; and therefore we can neither really wor&s;hip, nor put on any part of the appearance thereof, meerly in conformity to the injunctions of human autho|rity; believing it our duty rather to &s;hew our neighbours by our
<PB N="5" REF="017167_0005_0FA07362CB119A58">practice, that in this go&s;pel day the holy &s;pirit hath led us out of the formality of public fa&s;ts, which though, in practice under the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation, it does not appear that they are enjoined on Chri&s;tians, either by precept or example, from the New Te&s;ta|ment; Chri&s;t him&s;elf in his &s;piritual appearance being the teacher of his people, and when he leads them to fa&s;t, he directs that it be in private, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. vi. 16, 17 and 18.</NOTE> and that they appear not unto men to fa&s;t. This we believe to be our duty as a people to bear con&s;tant and open te&s;timony unto, and al&s;o to maintain it fully, and not in part only, le&s;t by falling &s;hort therein, we &s;hould deny Chri&s;t our Lord before men, whom we ought to acknow|ledge before all, and who hath &s;aid, "who&s;oever &s;hall deny me before men, him will I al&s;o deny before my Father which is in heaven."</P>
<P>Our forefathers, under full conviction of the rectitude of their principles, and uprightne&s;s of their intentions, of which they had given indubitable proofs, through a long &s;eries of &s;evere per&s;ecu|tions in their native land, borne with much firmne&s;s and Chri&s;tian patience, became at length intru&s;ted with, and intitled to, many valuable exten&s;ive rights and privileges; which induced them, at their own expence, to encounter the dangers of the &s;eas, and many other hazards and difficulties, to &s;ettle and improve this country, at that time a wilderne&s;s; having fir&s;t, in concert with their much beloved friend, the wife William Penn, formed &s;uch a con|&s;titution of government as gave the mo&s;t promi&s;ing pro&s;pect of &s;ecuring to them&s;elves, and their po&s;terity, the free and full en|joyment of liberty of con&s;cience, which they preferred to all tem|poral con&s;iderations, and were con&s;tantly careful to pre&s;erve not only to them&s;elves, but to all per&s;ons of every other religious de|nomination, who dwelt among them, and for a con&s;iderable num|ber of years the admini&s;tration of the laws was chiefly committed
<PB N="6" REF="017167_0006_0FA073638C608C70">to men of the &s;ame liberal principles; that by the divine ble&s;&s;ing on their pious concern for the pre&s;ent and future pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of the people, piety and virtue were promoted and en|couraged, vice and irreligion were di&s;countenanced, peace, har|mony and concord prevailed, and the enjoyment of religious and civil liberty was inviolably pre&s;erved. Thus Penn&s;ylvania be|came celebrated for the mildne&s;s and liberal temper of its go|vernment, and great numbers of &s;ober per&s;ons of tender con&s;cien|ces, of different religious profe&s;&s;ions, found a quiet retreat from the oppre&s;&s;ion and per&s;ecution to which they had been &s;ubjected in various parts of Europe.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t therefore appear &s;trange and extraordinary, in the view of candid enquirers, that &s;o evident a change and contra&s;t have taken place, and that we, many of whom are the de&s;cendants of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers, profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame religious principles, and con|nected in intere&s;t, affection and duty, to the real good and welfare of our country, who have never forfeited our birthright, &s;hould now be vilified, per&s;ecuted, impri&s;oned, and excluded from our ju&s;t liberties and privileges, not only by laws which have been calculated to oppre&s;s us, and the execution of them in &s;ome places committed to men of avaricious, profligate principles, who have made a prey of the innocent and indu&s;trious, to the great lo&s;s and damage of &s;ome, and the almo&s;t ruin of others; but &s;cur|rilous publications, and other invidious means u&s;ed by our adver|&s;aries to calumniate and reproach us with opprobrious names, in order to inflame the minds of the ignorant, and impo&s;e on the credulous, to our prejudice; when, upon an impartial candid ex|amination, we tru&s;t it will appear, that in the cour&s;e of the com|motions which have unhappily prevailed, no ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence will be found again&s;t us in the general, but that we have endea|voured to maintain our peaceable religious principles, to pre&s;erve
<PB N="7" REF="017167_0007_0FA07364510DF780">a good con&s;cience towards God, and to manife&s;t our good will to all men.</P>
<P>We are not incited by party views, or vindictive motives, in this repre&s;entation, but to awaken your cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate at|tention to our multiplied &s;ufferings and the abu&s;es we have re|ceived; knowing that magi&s;tracy is intended for a terror to evil doers, and an encouragement to the virtuous; but where the ne|ce&s;&s;ary care and exertions are not u&s;ed, for the prevention and &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of prophanity, tumults and outrage, and a virtuous part of the community are oppre&s;&s;ed and in&s;ulted, the true end of government is neglected, and anarchy, confu&s;ion, contempt of authority, and in&s;ecurity to per&s;ons and property, will &s;ucceed; and although public fa&s;ts may be proclaimed, and days under the name of humiliation recommended and appointed, and con|fe&s;&s;ion of &s;in and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion verbally made, yet, unle&s;s there be a true and &s;incere fa&s;ting from ambition, &s;trife, ill-will, animo&s;i|ties, infidelity, fraud, luxury, revelling, drunkenne&s;s, oppre&s;&s;ion, and all manner of evil, it cannot be a fa&s;t or acceptable day to the Lord; nor can we have a well grounded hope, that the &s;courge with which the inhabitants have been vi&s;ited will be re|moved, and days of peace and tranquility re&s;tored.</P>
<P>The di&s;pen&s;ation of war, blood&s;hed and calamity, which hath been permitted to prevail on this continent, is very &s;olemn and awful, demanding the mo&s;t &s;erious and heart-felt attention of all ranks and denominations among the people, individually to con|&s;ider and examine how far we are each of us really and &s;incerely engaged to bring forth fruits of true repentance, and amendment of life, agreeable to the &s;pirit and doctrine of the go&s;pel. And although we have been expo&s;ed to great abu&s;e and unchri&s;tian treatment, we wi&s;h to be enabled, through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine grace, to cheri&s;h in our&s;elves, and inculcate in others with whom
