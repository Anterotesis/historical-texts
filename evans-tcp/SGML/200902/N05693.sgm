<P>ON Saturday the 21&s;t of <HI>June,</HI> in the Forenoon, the Governor attended by &s;everal Members of His Maje&s;ty's Council for the &s;aid Province, the Speaker, and &s;e|veral Members of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, with divers other Gentlemen; and accompany'd by the Honorable Col. <HI>Paul Ma&s;carene,</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioner from the Province of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> embark'd on board the Ship <HI>Burryeau</HI> for <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay;</HI> and on pa&s;&s;ing Ca&s;tle <HI>William</HI> was join'd by the Province Sloop <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> having on board Major-General <HI>Win&s;low,</HI> and other Officers of the Forces rais'd for his Maje&s;ty's Service in the intended Expedition upon the River <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> and eight Tran&s;port Ve&s;&s;els, on Board of which were 500 of the &s;aid Forces; the remaining 300, which were not then ready, being ordered to embark and follow in a few Days.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 26th of <HI>June,</HI> in the Forenoon, the Governor came to an Anchor in the Harbour at <HI>Falmouth,</HI> where he found the Province Sloop and Tran&s;ports had ar|riv'd the Day before, and the Forces encamp'd on <HI>Bang</HI>'s I&s;land; that the Honorable <HI>Daniel Warner, Peter Gilman</HI> and <HI>Clement March,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;qrs</ABBR> Commi&s;&s;ioners from the Go|vernment of <HI>New Hamp&s;hire</HI> were come to meet him, and that the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians had waited there &s;ome Days for his Arrival.</P>
<P>Upon going on Shoar the Governor was inform'd by Capt. <HI>Lithgow,</HI> the Commander of <HI>Richmond</HI> Fort, that a Party of the <HI>Ar&s;&s;egunticook</HI> Indians, which he &s;uppos'd to be then within the di&s;tance of 7 or 8 Miles of it, had, in An&s;wer to his Excellency's Letter of Notification to the Indians, to meet him at the Interview, declar'd, that they &s;hould not come, becau&s;e they had not yet wip'd away the Blood of the two Indians belonging to their Tribe, which had been kill'd the la&s;t Year within the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame Day, in the Afternoon, the Governor receiv'd a Letter from Capt. <HI>Bradbury,</HI> dated at St. <HI>George</HI>'s the 18th of <HI>June,</HI> inclo&s;ing one from Father <HI>Gounon,</HI> the <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> of the <HI>Penob&s;cot</HI> Tribe of Indians to Father <HI>Audran</HI> the <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> of the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Tribe, dated at <HI>Penob&s;cot</HI> the 4th of <HI>June</HI> 1754, which he had intercepted by Means of the In|dian, to whom the Carriage of it was intru&s;ted; and informing his Excellency, that the &s;ame Indian had told him, <Q>That he had lately had the Carriage of another Letter from <HI>Canada</HI> committed to him, which he lo&s;t upon the Road; that it was a bad one, tho' he would not undertake to &s;ay fully what the Contents of it were; but that he certainly
<PB N="4" REF="007222_0003_102B3FC1EDF5AFA0">knew that the <HI>French</HI> Indians, in great Numbers, were determin'd to come over [from <HI>Canada</HI>] to this Side of the Country, when the Corn &s;hould be fit to gather, and fall upon the <HI>English.</HI></Q>&mdash;Capt. <HI>Bradbury</HI> al&s;o inform'd his Excellency in the &s;ame Letter, "That he was almo&s;t &s;ure, the <HI>Penob&s;cot</HI> Indians would not meet him at <HI>Falmouth.</HI>" (As they had likewi&s;e declared to his Excellency, in a Letter wrote to him by them in behalf of the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians, as well as them&s;elves, before he left <HI>Boston,</HI>) <Q>tho' he [Capt. <HI>Bradbury</HI>] thought the <HI>French</HI> would find it difficult to per&s;wade the <HI>Pe|nob&s;cots</HI> to break with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> unle&s;s they &s;hould be forc'd into it by great Num|bers of <HI>French</HI> Indians from <HI>Canada.</HI></Q></P>
<P>On the Day following the Governor receiv'd a Letter from <HI>James Bane,</HI> dated in <HI>June;</HI> in which he inform'd him, <Q>That the Chief Man's Son of <HI>Pa&s;&s;am<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">quody</HI> had told Capt. <HI>Bradbury</HI> and him&s;elf at St. <HI>Georges,</HI> that the Indians of the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Tribe had &s;ent two Belts of Wampum to the <HI>Penob&s;cots,</HI> to get them to join <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Ca|nada</HI> Indians and them&s;elves again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and that there was ab&s;olutely a Number of <HI>Canada</HI> Indians, then at <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> on that Bu&s;ine&s;s; but that they had not determin'd what to do as yet.</Q></P>

From the in&s;olent Behaviour of the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians in general towards the In|habitants of <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River, and at <HI>Richmond</HI> Fort, it was apprehended for &s;ome Weeks before the Interview, that they were upon the point of breaking out into open Ho&s;tilities; &s;o that their Arrival at <HI>Falmouth</HI> to meet his Excellency was contrary to Expectation, and &s;eems owing to the Accident of their Prielt's having left them 20 Days before, to go to <HI>Canada,</HI> again&s;t the Advice of the Je&s;uit of the <HI>Penob&s;cots,</HI> and the mi&s;-carriage of that Je&s;uit's Letter before-mention'd to him.</P>

<P>I Would have you let the Chiefs of the <HI>Penob&s;cot</HI> Indians know, that in compliance with their and the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Tribe's repeated Reque&s;t in their Letter dated from <HI>Richmond</HI> the la&s;t Winter; wherein they pre&s;s'd me to come early this Summer in Per&s;on to treat with them upon the Matters therein mention'd, I am come to this Place, as &s;oon as the public Affairs of the Province, and <HI>their</HI> Hunting Sea&s;on would permit me, to meet them; and tell them, that I bring with me a &s;incere Di&s;po|&s;ition to renew and &s;trengthen the antient Friend&s;hip, which hath from Time to Time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between this Government and their Tribe.</P>
<P>I would likewi&s;e have you let them know, that I have thought very much upon what they wrote to me in their la&s;t Letter from St. <HI>George's,</HI> concerning their Expecta|tion, that I would come thither to treat with them, and that River's being the u&s;ual Place of Conference between the Governors of this Province, and their Tribe; and you mu&s;t tell them from me, that they are greatly mi&s;taken in that Matter: Neither Gover|nor <HI>Shutt,</HI> nor Governor <HI>Dummer,</HI> nor Governor <HI>Belcher</HI> ever met them at St. <HI>George</HI>'s; they (the Indians) came from St. <HI>George</HI>'s to <HI>Arrow&s;ick</HI> I&s;land in 1717, to meet the fir&s;t of tho&s;e Governors, and always either to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> or <HI>Falmouth</HI> to treat with the other two: It is true that I appointed my fir&s;t Interview and Conference with them in 1742, to be held at St. <HI>George</HI>'s; but the Rea&s;on of my choo&s;ing that Place then, was, becau&s;e I was de&s;irous of vi&s;iting the mo&s;t remote Settlements in that Part of the Province, at my fir&s;t taking the Admini&s;tration of the Government upon me; and if I <HI>had</HI> come to St. <HI>George</HI>'s at that Time upon <HI>their Reque&s;t,</HI> yet even that would be a &s;trong Rea&s;on why they &s;hould now come to meet me at <HI>Falmouth;</HI> where Col. <HI>Ma&s;carene</HI> hath accompany'd me, as a Commi&s;&s;ioner from the Government of <HI>Nova-|Scotia,</HI> and three Commi&s;&s;ioners from the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> to have an Interview likewi&s;e with them, on the Part of tho&s;e Provinces.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="007222_0006_102B3FC702F90068">
Upon the whole, I would have you acquaint them, that <HI>I &s;ully expeil</HI> them to come to me to this Place; that I have &s;ent a Sloop to bring them thither, and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours for them to make u&s;e of upon this Occa&s;ion; and order'd you to attend and conduct them; that if they per&s;i&s;t in their Refu&s;al to do it, after I am come &s;o far to brighten the Covenant Chain with them, and &s;o early in the Year to gratify them; I &s;hall look upon it as a great Affront to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Governments, and a &s;ure Mark that they are indifferent whether they pre&s;erve our antient Amity and Kindne&s;s for them or not.</P>
<P>I particularly ob&s;erve, what they write to me at the End of their Letter; in which they &s;ay, "That they write in behalf of the <HI>Norridgwalks,</HI> as well as them&s;elves." This mu&s;t be

<P>Upon this Occa&s;ion I would have you remind them of their Prie&s;t's Letter to me, which I communicated to them the la&s;t Summer; in which he endeavour'd to di&s;wade me from &s;ending Commi&s;&s;ioners the la&s;t Year, to di&s;tribute the Pre&s;ents from this Go|vernment to them; and of the Proofs I then &s;ent them of his Artifices to rai&s;e Jealou&s;ies among them, in order to break off our Friend&s;hip: And I would have you a&s;&s;ure them, that I have lately receiv'd undoubted Proofs of the &s;ame Prie&s;t's acting at this Time the like treacherous Part to them, and u&s;ing his utmo&s;t Endeavours to engage them in Acts of Ho&s;tility again&s;t us.</P>

<P>At the &s;ame Time; as the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians were the original Proprietors of the Lands upon <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River, and the only Indians now intere&s;ted in them, and there was Rea&s;on to expect that the Pre&s;ence of the <HI>Penob&s;cots,</HI> who would probably come fully in&s;tincted by their Prie&s;t to u&s;e their utmo&s;t Influence over the <HI>Norridgwalks</HI> in oppo&s;ition to the intended March to the Head of <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> &amp;c. the erecting a Fort higher up the River than <HI>Richmond,</HI> and making further the Settlements upon it, would embarra&s;s the Conference with the <HI>Norridgwalks</HI> upon tho&s;e Points; the Governor determin'd with the Advice of His Maje&s;ty's Council, to have a &s;eperate Conference with the la&s;t mention'd Indians, and di&s;patch them away from <HI>Falmouth</HI> (if po&s;&s;ible) before the Arrival of the <HI>Penob&s;cots</HI> there.</P>
<P>The Delay likewi&s;e, which the Governor's &s;taying for the Arrival of the <HI>Penob&s;cots,</HI> before he treated with the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians, would have occa&s;ion'd to the Proceed|ing of the Troops, who&s;e Pre&s;ence at <HI>Ca&s;co,</HI> during the Conference with tho&s;e Indians, it was apprehended would contribute to make them acquie&s;ce in the March of the Forces thro' their Country, building the intended Forts up the River <HI>Kennebeck</HI> above <HI>Richmond,</HI> and making other Settlements upon it, was another Motive for hastening on the Con|ference with that Tribe.</P>
<P>Accordingly his Excellency receiv'd a Vi&s;it from the <HI>Norridgwalks</HI> the &s;ame Day at his Lodgings; and appointed the Day following, being Friday the 28th of <HI>June</HI> to &s;peak with them in publick.</P>

<P>'I Hope I meet you all in good Health this Morning: I gave Orders &s;ince I &s;aw you here Ye&s;terday, that every Thing, which you and your Squaws then de&s;ir'd of me, &s;hould be provided for you as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have a long Time wanted that which is good, viz. <HI>Peace:</HI> We al&s;o want that which is good; and we want to &s;ee you the next Spring; and when we hear each other talk, we will both endeavour to do that, which is right be|tween us.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>'You have well &s;poken, <HI>Brethren,</HI> in what you have &s;aid; and I am now come to talk with you upon it; and to do what is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ettling our Peace upon a la&s;ting Foundation.</P>
<P>'The <HI>French</HI> have of late built Forts in &s;everal Places upon this Continent, within the Territories of King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> which hath greatly di&s;turb'd our Peace in tho&s;e Par's; and I am inform'd, that they either have, or de&s;ign &s;oon to erect one on the River <HI>Ken|nebeck,</HI> or the Carrying-Place called <HI>Wa-non-du-wa wan-nock,</HI> near the Head of it, which is within the Limits of this Government: If they &s;hould be &s;uffer'd to do that, <HI>Brethren,</HI> it would &s;oon de&s;troy your and our Peace upon this River. I have there|fore brought with me a &s;trong Body of Soldiers to march up to the Head of it, and over the Carrying-Place, in order to di&s;cover whether the <HI>French</HI> have made any Settlements, or built any Forts there, or not; and in ca&s;e they have, or are attempting to do it, I &s;hall &s;ummon them in a peaceable Manner to retire, and if they &s;hall refu&s;e to depart out of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Territories, I will drive them off by Force.</P>
<P>'Further, <HI>Brethren,</HI> In order to hinder the <HI>French</HI> from making Incroachments upon the River <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> it is my Intention to build a &s;trong Hou&s;e upon it, higher up than <HI>Richmond;</HI> and a large Magazine to lodge our Stores at, in our Way thither: And as this &s;trong Hou&s;e will be nearer your Head-Quarters at <HI>Norridgwalk,</HI> than that at <HI>Rich|mond</HI> is, I de&s;ign to remove the Truck Trade from <HI>Richmond</HI> to that Place; &s;o that then you will have le&s;s Way to come for your nece&s;&s;ary Supplies than you now have: And in ca&s;e we &s;hould have a War with the <HI>French,</HI> (which we &s;hall u&s;e all Means in our Power to prevent, and I hope will not happen) this &s;trong Hou&s;e will be a Place of Shelter and Protection to you, as well as to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> again&s;t their Ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>'You will judge, <HI>Brethren,</HI> how well di&s;pos'd my Heart is towards you in this Mat|ter, by my hiding from you nothing, which I have in it; and I hope you think what I &s;ay is right.</P>
<P>'You moreover &s;ay, <HI>Brethren,</HI> in your Letter to me, that you <Q>like well Gover|nour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty, and what was then done; and that Governour <HI>Dummer</HI> then &s;et the Bounds between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and you.</Q></P>

<P>'I &s;hall &s;ay nothing further to you at pre&s;ent than that the&s;e are weighty Matters, which nearly concern the Welfare of your Tribe, and I hope your An&s;wer to me upon them will be a wi&s;e one, and &s;uch as will promote <HI>that</HI> by &s;ecuring our Friend&s;hip and Kindne&s;s to you.'</P>

<P>The Governour made here a &s;hort Pau&s;e, expecting an An&s;wer from the Indians; but they &s;eeming a little confounded, and making none, he proceeded;</P>
<P>'I now look upon my &s;elf as treating with your Tribe only.</P>

<P>'I would put you in Mind of what happen'd in Times pa&s;t; About 30 or 40 Years ago, the <HI>French</HI> &s;tirr'd up your's and the neighbouring Indian Tribes, when they were at Peace with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to make War with them&mdash;The Indians during the Continuance of it committed Ravages in our Borders, and kill'd &s;everal of our People; But what Fruits did the Tribe of <HI>Norridgwalks</HI> reap, by the Mi&s;chief which they then join'd in doing to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> they had &s;everal of their young Men cut off, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at la&s;t, being highly provok'd by their Ho&s;tilities, &s;ell upon the old Town of <HI>Norridgwalk,</HI> de&s;troy'd many of the Tribe, and drove them all off from their Lands, which by Right of Condue&s;t in War (a Title held to be good by all the Indian Tribes in general among them&s;elves,) the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> became Ma&s;ters of, and it was intirely ow|ing to <HI>their</HI> Kindne&s;s to <HI>your</HI> Tribe, that you were re&s;tor'd to tho&s;e Lands by Governor <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty, and &s;uffer'd to return and live in Peace upon your pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>

<P>'I have another Article, <HI>Brethren,</HI> to &s;peak with you upon.</P>
<P>'By Governor <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty it is agreed, That <Q>if any Conttoverfies or Diffe|rences &s;hould at any Time after happen to ari&s;e, between any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> for any real or &s;uppo&s;ed Wrong, or Injury done on either Side, no private Revenge &s;hall be taken for the &s;ame, but proper Application made to his Maje&s;ty's Government upon the Place, for Remedy or Redre&s;s thereof, in a due Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P>'This was ratified by the Treaty of Peace made in 1749, and the <HI>Norridgwalks, Penob&s;cots, Ar&s;&s;egunticooks,</HI> and <HI>Weeweenocks</HI> thereby engag'd further <Q>That if any In|dians &s;hould at any Time commit any Acts of Ho&s;tility again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they would join their young Men with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in reducing &s;uch <HI>Indians</HI> to Rea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>'Now, <HI>Brethren,</HI> It hath unfortunately happen'd that two Indians of the <HI>Ar&s;&s;egunti|cook</HI> Tribe were kill'd the la&s;t Year, by two <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> in the Government of <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> for &s;everal Injuries and In&s;ults which the&s;e Indians had been guilty of within it: The Cir|cum&s;tances of which I &s;hall relate to you. In <HI>April</HI> 1752, two Indians of that Tribe named <HI>Sabatis</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;ti,</HI> came to <HI>Canterbury</HI> in the afore&s;aid Province, where they were friendly entertain'd above a Month; but at their going off they &s;tole two Negroes, which they bound and carried over <HI>Merrimack</HI> River, where one of them made his E&s;cape and return'd to his Ma&s;ter; but the other was carried to <HI>Canada,</HI> and &s;old to a <HI>French</HI> Officer at <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> at which Place he &s;till remains; or was &s;een very lately.</P>
<P>'In <HI>May</HI> following a Party of ten or twelve <HI>Ar&s;&s;egunticook</HI> Indians met with four <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Men, at a Branch of <HI>Contoocook</HI> River, within the Government of <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> &s;hot one of them dead upon the Spot, captivated and carried two of them to <HI>Canada,</HI> where they were detain'd &s;ome Months, and until they were ran&s;om'd; the other with Difficulty making his E&s;cape: All which was done in Time of Peace.</P>
<P>'In 1753, the aforenamed <HI>Sabatis</HI> came again to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> where being reproached by the Wife of the Man, from whom he and his Companion had the Year before &s;tolen the Negro, which they had &s;old in <HI>Canada,</HI> he together with another Indian then in Company, was guilty of great Outrages to her; and it was by the&s;e and other Injuries and In&s;ults committed by them there, that the two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men were provok'd to kill them &s;oon after; but the Government of <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI> di&s;approving the Action (as is well known from their Proceedings again&s;t the Per&s;ons, who were &s;uppos'd to be guilty of it) have di&s;claim'd the private Revenge, which the two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men in their Province took of the <HI>Ar&s;&s;egunticook</HI> Indians, for the Injuries and In&s;ults which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had re|ceiv'd from them, and us'd Endeavours to bring to Puni&s;hment the Offenders, who were guilty of a Breach of the &s;aid Treaties: And you &s;ee, Brethren, that that Government have now &s;ent three Commi&s;&s;ioners to meet the <HI>Ar&s;&s;egunticooks</HI> here, in order to have Injuries on both Sides redre&s;s'd in a Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice, and an amicable Manner.</P>
<P>'The <HI>Ar&s;&s;egunticooks</HI> ought to have acted the like Part, and met us here, e&s;pecially as &s;ince they knew of the killing of tho&s;e two Indians, they renewed the Treaty of Peace made with the Governments of <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> in 1749, by &s;igning a Ratification of it at <HI>Richmond</HI> in the Fall of the Year, and accepted Part of the Pre&s;ents which the Govern|ment of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> made to the Indians upon that Occa&s;ion; and join'd the la&s;t Winter with your Tribe and the <HI>Penob&s;cots,</HI> in pre&s;&s;ing me to meet them in the&s;e Parts early this Summer: But in&s;tead of doing this, they have within the la&s;t &s;even Weeks captivated an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, with his Wife and three Children in the Province of <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> and plunder'd his Hou&s;e, as they did at the &s;ame Time the Hou&s;e of ano|ther <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man in the Neighbourhood, which happen'd fortunately to have left it a Day or two before the Indians came: And they declare that they will take further Revenge upon the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> for which Purpo&s;e they have a Party out now near <HI>Richmond,</HI> waiting for an Opportunity to do it.</P>

<P>'You will not think much of my being &s;o &s;olicitous to know whether I can now depend upon your pacifick Profe&s;&s;ions, if you recollect your Behaviour towards us &s;oon after your &s;igning the Treaty of 1749.&mdash; About nine or ten Months after that, your Tribe join'd with &s;ome of the <HI>Ar&s;&s;egunticook</HI> and <HI>Penob&s;cot</HI> Indians in captivating &s;even|teen of the People of this Government; <HI>viz.</HI> thirteen from <HI>Swan-I&s;land,</HI> one from <HI>Richmond,</HI> two from <HI>Sheep&s;cot,</HI> and one from <HI>Brun&s;wick;</HI> as al&s;o in killing a great Num|ber of our Cattle: The Rea&s;on given by you for the doing of this Mi&s;chief was, that it was done to &s;atisfy you for two <HI>Indians,</HI> which happen'd to be kill'd by &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> After which you declar'd to us, That the <HI>Indian</HI> Blood was then wip'd away&mdash;And that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might go &s;afely about their Bu&s;ine&s;s; for that it was Peace between all the <HI>Indians</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>'The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> thinking you &s;incere in this Declaration left their Garri&s;ons, and return'd to their Dwelling-Hou&s;es; but notwith&s;tanding your Declarations, when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were off their Guard, &s;ome of the <HI>Ar&s;&s;egunticook</HI> Indians &s;oon after captivated three Boys at <HI>North Yarmouth,</HI> kill'd &s;ome Cattle, and burnt and plunder'd &s;everal Hou&s;es; and &s;oon after that kill'd a Man coming from <HI>North Yarmouth;</HI> A &s;hort Time after this, &s;ix Men were captivated, and one Man kill'd at the <HI>New-Meadows,</HI> together with nineteen Cattle, as was al&s;o a con&s;iderable Number of Cattle at <HI>Richmond</HI> about the &s;ame Time; and in doing this la&s;t mention'd Mi&s;chief, <HI>your</HI> Tribe was principally con|cern'd, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted only by a few <HI>Canada</HI> Indians in &s;ome Part of it; other Part of it being done by your Tribe alone: And we are certain that the&s;e Accounts are true, becau&s;e we have receiv'd them from &s;ome of your own Tribe.</P>

<P>'The Endeavours of your Prie&s;t to prevent my &s;ending Commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with you the la&s;t Fall, and to di&s;tribute the Government of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI>'s Pre&s;ents to you, and rai&s;e Jealou&s;ies and a Mi&s;under&s;tanding between us then, (of all which I ap|pris'd you in my Letter by tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners,) leave me no Room to doubt now to whom I am to Impute your late ill Behaviour: But as I am per&s;waded that it proceeded from his bad Coun&s;el, and not from the genuine Sentiments of your own Hearts, and find by your coming here, that you have con&s;ider'd better of the Matter; I &s;hall pa&s;s it over, in hopes that you will not offer this Government the like Affront for the future.'</P>
<P>Here the Governour declar'd to them his Intention of &s;ending a Body of Soldiers to the Head of <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River, and acro&s;s the Carrying-Place between that and the River <HI>Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">diere;</HI> and building Forts upon the River <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> in the &s;ame Manner that be did to the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians: <HI>And proceeded thus,</HI></P>

<P>'Tho' I well know, <HI>Brethren,</HI> that your Tribe never pretended to own any Lands upon the River <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> yet as a Proof that I would hide nothing from you, which I have in my Heart to do; I have acquainted you likewi&s;e with my De&s;ign.'</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'I have been inform'd that a large Number of the <HI>French</HI> Indians will be &s;ent from <HI>Canada</HI> to commit Ho&s;tilities again&s;t us in the Time of Indian Harve&s;t; and that the <HI>French</HI> have promi&s;ed to build Forts at <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> and the Head of the River St. <HI>Francois,</HI> for the Protection of tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> who &s;hall be concern'd in it.'</P>

<P>'In the Letter, which you &s;ent me the la&s;t Winter, you expre&s;s your Satisfaction in Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty, and promi&s;e to abide by it; and to &s;how you, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Governments are determin'd to &s;tand by it too, we are ready to ratify and confirm it, together with the Treaty of Peace made at <HI>Falmouth</HI> in <HI>Ca&s;ce Bay,</HI> in 1749: But before we proceed to do that, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to hear what you &s;ay in An&s;wer to what I have been inform'd of, concerning the De&s;igns of the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Canada,</HI> their making or erecting Settlements or Forts at <HI>Kennebeck, Penob&s;cot,</HI> or el&s;ewhere within the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Territories: And as the Matters I have laid before you require your &s;erious Con&s;idera|tion, I &s;hall wait until to Morrow Morning for your An&s;wer.'</P>

<P>'The French have not built, neither are they building any Fort near us, as you have been inform'd: Some of our Tribe went to <HI>Canada</HI> the la&s;t Spring, where they were told it was all Peace between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French;</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> advi&s;ed them to keep Peace with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and do no Mi&s;chief.</P>

<P>'I am a Man, my Heart is good, and what I now &s;ay is true.</P>
<P>'When we were at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> you told us if any thing bad was like to happen, it &s;hould be di&s;cover'd to us.</P>
<P>'If the Hatchet was like to be taken up, we would inform you of it&mdash;It is our full In|tention to keep the Path between us open and clear.'</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P>'When you met me at St. <HI>George's</HI> about thirteen Years ago, you brought with you a Counter-part of Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty&mdash;What is become of it?'</P>

<P>'I have already told you, the <HI>French</HI> are not building any Forts on our Lands; &mdash; You may depend upon it, that what we have &s;aid is true.</P>
<P>We are not willing that either the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould build any Forts or make any Settlements upon our River; and we have declar'd to the <HI>French</HI> that they never &s;hall incroach on our Lands.'</P>

<P>Then his Excellency order'd the Ratifications of the Treaty made by Lieut.

<P>'I would &s;peak to you concerning the Behaviour of the <HI>Ar&s;&s;egunticooks.</HI></P>
<P>'By the two Treaties before-mention'd it is agreed, That <Q>if any real or &s;uppo&s;ed Wrong &s;hould happen to be done by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Indians</HI> to either Party, no private Revenge &s;hould be taken, but Application made to the King's Government to have the &s;ame redre&s;s'd in a Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice: And it is further engag'd by the Indians; That if any of your Tribes of Indians &s;hould break the&s;e Treaties, you would join your young Men with ours, and reduce &s;uch Indians to Rea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>'The <HI>Ar&s;&s;egunticook</HI> Indians were pre&s;ent the la&s;t Year at the Ratification of tho&s;e Treaties, agreed to them, and receiv'd the Governments Pre&s;ents.'</P>

<P>Wherefore, to prevent any more Blood&s;hed, I mu&s;t now call upon you to join <HI>your</HI> young Men with <HI>ours</HI> in reducing the&s;e Indians to Rea&s;on.'</P>
