<P>What remains, is, for you to Enquire, Whether you have <HI>Omitted no Duty,</HI> the Omi&s;&s;ion whereof may be unea&s;y to you in a <HI>Dying Hour.</HI> Such a Duty often, is that of <HI>Joining to a Particular Church,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> So, coming to the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord, and there Laying Hold on His <HI>Covenant.</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you have hitherto Delay'd this Duty, 'tis <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w</HI> High Time to do it.

<P>And now, Your FAITH! You Read, Heb.

<P>Yet by <HI>Faith</HI> Submit unto His Holy Will. We read of <HI>Rachel;</HI> Gen.

<P>One of the Fir&s;t Things to be done, is to Give up your <HI>New-born Child</HI> unto the Lord, in His Holy <HI>Bapti&s;m.</HI> Thus re&s;cue the Child, from the <HI>Great Red Dra|gon,</HI> who is watching to Devour it. Let the <HI>Child</HI> be either <HI>Male</HI> or <HI>Female,</HI> this is a matter to be left entirely unto the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of the Glorious GOD. Either of them, if it be a <HI>Perfect Child,</HI> brings ten Thou&s;and Mercies with it. And, if it may be a <HI>Child</HI> of God the Father, a <HI>Sub|ject</HI> of God the Son, a <HI>Temple</HI> of God the Spirit, think, <HI>This is enough; Lord, I have
<PB N="35" REF="001463_0038_0FB34B5F5FD4F0E8">
brought One of thy Children into the World.</HI></P>
<P>As a Declaration of this Intention in you, Send the Child abroad, unto the Congregation of the Faithful, where it &s;hall be <HI>Wa&s;hed,</HI> and <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed</HI> in the Name of the Glorious One, and laid under E|verla&s;ting <HI>Bonds</HI> to be the Lords. But at the &s;ame time, Look on your &s;elf as laid under <HI>Bonds,</HI> to bring up the Child for Him; and <HI>in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>You will <HI>Suckle your Infant your Self</HI> if you can; Be not &s;uch an <HI>O&s;trich</HI> as to Decline it, meerly becau&s;e you would be One of the <HI>Carele&s;s Women, Living at Ea&s;e.</HI> Of &s;uch we read, They are <HI>Dead while they Live.</HI> But if you have the Calamity of <HI>Dry Brea&s;ts;</HI> or your Health will not permit you to <HI>Give Suck;</HI> Entertain it with Submi&s;&s;ion to the will of God; but as a <HI>Calamity.</HI></P>
<P>Finally; Being well Recovered, you will Rejoyce in your Fre&s;h Opportunities to Repair unto the Wor&s;hip of God in His <HI>Congregations.</HI> Thither you will now Repair with &s;uch Di&s;po&s;itions as tho&s;e;
