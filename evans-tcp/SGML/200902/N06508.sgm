<HEAD>To His GRACE the Duke of NEW CASTLE, Fir&s;t LORD Commi&s;&s;ioner of His MAJESTY's TREASURY, KNIGHT of the Mo&s;t Noble Order of the GARTER, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Events, which are the Subject of the&s;e Me|moirs, had their Ri&s;e in <HI>North America,</HI> when your Grace's particular Department, as one of his Ma|je&s;ty's Principal Secretaries of State, put the Affairs of that <HI>Continent</HI> under your Grace's more immediate Di|rection: And tho&s;e, who are acquainted with the fir&s;t Springs and Movements, which &s;et the&s;e Expeditions on foot, and with the Character of the Per&s;on in <HI>America,</HI> who was chiefly in&s;trumental in conducting them there, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that the Succe&s;s was wholly owing to the Influence of your Grace's Admini&s;tration, and ought therefore to be reckoned among the other happy Effects of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e, my Lord, together with the Ambition, which the Author has of making his public Acknowledgments to your Grace for per&s;onal Obligations, are the Motives, which have induced him to take the Liberty of addre&s;|&s;ing the following Sheets to your Grace; and encour|age him to hope, that they will be honoured with your Grace's Protection.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, my Lord, that the Succe&s;s of the la&s;t War in <HI>North America</HI> was not equal to the great Idea
<PB N="iv" REF="008258_0003_102DE8B88FCC6F00">formed in your Grace's Mind at that time for the Ser|vice of your King and Country.</P>
<P>Had your Grace's Plan tran&s;mitted to <HI>New England</HI> in 1746 for the Reduction of <HI>Canada</HI> been carried into Execution that Year, as it would have been, if it had not been fru&s;trated by unfore&s;een, inevitable Accidents in <HI>Europe,</HI> again&s;t which it was not in the Power of Hu|man Policy to provide; that would have crowned the War with the mo&s;t important Conque&s;t to the Intere&s;ts of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that was ever made upon the Conti|nent of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>But, my Lord, &s;hort as the Events of the War fell of your Grace's Scheme; yet the Con&s;equences were, not only the Pre&s;ervation of <HI>Great Britain</HI>'s mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Territory in <HI>North America</HI> for &s;ecuring to her the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all her other Colonies there (at a time when the Enemy had reduced it to &s;uch Extremities, that its Fate &s;eemed to depend upon as &s;lender a Thread, as it could po&s;&s;ibly do; but an Acqui&s;ition to his Ma|je&s;ty's Dominions, which, in all Appearance, accelerated the Extinction of a mo&s;t expen&s;ive War to <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI> and laid the Foundation for re&s;toring at that time the public Tranquility of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>May your Grace's unwearied Coun&s;els for the Na|tion's Welfare be con&s;tantly attended with Succe&s;s, e|qual to the Patriot Views, with which they are formed; and your King and Country long reap the &s;alutary Fruits of them.</P>

<P>_THE two fir&s;t Objects of the War in <HI>North-America</HI> were <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> or <HI>Acadie,</HI> and the I&s;land of Cape <HI>Breton:</HI> again&s;t the former of the&s;e the <HI>French,</HI> &s;oon after the Declaration of War in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> made three Attempts; in the fir&s;t of which they &s;urprized the I&s;land of <HI>Can&s;o,</HI> burnt its Forts and other Buildings, de&s;troyed the Fi&s;hery there, and carried the Garri&s;on Pri&s;oners to <HI>Louisbourg;</HI> and in the two la&s;t reduced <HI>Annapolis-Royal,</HI> the principal Fort and ancient Metropolis of the Province, to great Extremities: In the Year following the Colonies of <HI>New-England</HI> pro&s;ecuted an Expedition again&s;t Cape <HI>Breton;</HI> in which they took it, and brought the Inha|bitants of the I&s;land of <HI>St. John's,</HI> &s;ituate in the Gulf of <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> to make their Submi&s;&s;ion upon the &s;ame Terms with tho&s;e granted to <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> and to give Ho&s;tages for delivering Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the I&s;land to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>

As an Account of the Importance of the two fir&s;t|mentioned Places to both Nations will throw Light up|on the &s;everal Operations and Incidents of the War, it will be proper here briefly to &s;tate it.</P>
<P><HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> is the Key of the Ea&s;tern Colonies up|on the Continent of <HI>North-America;</HI> it has about nine|ty Leagues of Sea-Coa&s;t upon the <HI>Atlantic</HI> Ocean ex|tending from Cape <HI>Can&s;o</HI> Ea&s;tward, which lies at the Entrance into the Gut or Streights of that Name (thro' which there is a Pa&s;&s;age into the Gulf of <HI>St. Lawrence</HI>) to Cape <HI>Sables</HI> We&s;tward, which forms one Point of the Entrance into the Bay of <HI>Funda:</HI> This Coa&s;t a|bounds with mo&s;t commodious Harbours for capital Ships of War, and Banks of the be&s;t Cod-Fi&s;h in <HI>North|America;</HI> and is very advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated for com|manding the Navigation of that Part of the Ocean: Its Ea&s;tern Side forms Part of the Gulf of <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> along which it lies extended about 110 Leagues from the Gut of <HI>Can&s;o,</HI> at it's Entrance into the Gulf, to Cape <HI>Rozier,</HI> which forms the South Point of the Mouth of the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> through which the whole Country of <HI>Canada</HI> receivs all its Supplies and Supports from <HI>France:</HI> This Coa&s;t al&s;o has &s;everal good Fi&s;heries and Harbours, particularly the Bay of <HI>Ga&s;pe,</HI> Bay <HI>des Chaleurs,</HI> and Bay <HI>Verte,</HI> the latter whereof is &s;epara|ted by a narrow I&s;thmus, about 18 Miles long, from the Bay of <HI>Funda,</HI> which is about 50 Leagues deep, and comprehended within the Province: In this Bay are the three Ba&s;ons of <HI>Annapolis, Minas</HI> or <HI>Les Mines,</HI> and <HI>Chiegnecto;</HI> the Coa&s;ts whereof and Banks of the adja|cent Rivers abound with Salt Mar&s;hes, which by the Force of a rich Soil, con&s;tantly recruited with marine Salts, and &s;o, not to be impoveri&s;hed by con&s;tant Til|lage, produce large Crops of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Grain, with little Labour to the Husbandman; and among other Rivers, which fall into it, lies that of <HI>St. John's</HI> through which the City of <HI>Quebec</HI> has a Communication with the Bay, and acro&s;s the Head of that, through the Gulf of <HI>St.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="008258_0006_102DE8BFE7AD6110"><HI>Lawrence,</HI> with <HI>Louisbourg:</HI> The North Side of the Province is bounded by the Southern Bank of the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> along which it is extended from Cape <HI>Rozier</HI> to <HI>Le Bik,</HI> about 80 Leagues; and the We&s;tern Side by the River <HI>Pentagoet</HI> or <HI>Penob&s;cot,</HI> which &s;epa|rates it from <HI>New-England:</HI> Its inland Parts afford a Plenty of Pa&s;turage, with all Kinds of Roots, produces good Oak Timber for Ship Building, and white Pine Ma&s;ts, and has a large Store of Mines in the Di&s;tri&s;t of <HI>Minas</HI> or <HI>Les Mines,</HI> which derives its Name from them.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated, it is evident, that <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> when in the Hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mu&s;t be a Barrier to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>North-America;</HI> and the Command it gives them of the Navigation of the Gulf of <HI>St. Law|rence</HI> and <HI>Bay of Funda,</HI> puts it into their Power to cut off the Communication between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Canada,</HI> through the River of <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> which empties it|&s;elf into the former, and <HI>St. John's</HI> that falls into the latter; which leaves the <HI>French</HI> no Entrance into it, except by the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi;</HI> the Pa&s;&s;age through which, the River <HI>Ohio</HI> and the great Lakes and Rivers beyond it, to <HI>Montreal,</HI> is a mo&s;t difficult Navigation of 2000 Miles, for the greate&s;t Part again&s;t the Stream, and incumber'd with Falls, &s;o that it is impracticable for <HI>France</HI> to give her Colonies in <HI>Canada</HI> an effectual Support through this <HI>Route;</HI> and con&s;equently in &s;uch Ca&s;e &s;he mu&s;t hold them at the Will of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand, whil&s;t <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> is in the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>French,</HI> it puts it into their Power, by the Command it gives them of the Navigation to and from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Northern Colonies, particularly tho&s;e of <HI>New England,</HI> to harra&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s them exceedingly; and by its near Situation to the Ea&s;tern Parts of the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Bay, and the Province of <HI>New Hamp&s;hire,</HI> to deprive <HI>Great Britain</HI> of the Naval Stores, which are now drawn from the King's Woods there for ma&s;ting the Royal Navy: And whereas the cold Climate and un|fruitful
<PB N="12" REF="008258_0007_102DE8C19337E818">Soil of <HI>Canada</HI> and Cape <HI>Breton</HI> yield only a bare Su&s;tenance for their pre&s;ent Inhabitants, and make tho&s;e Colonies incapable of &s;upporting a large Number of Troops; in which Circum&s;tance con&s;i&s;ts very much the Security of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies again&s;t the Incroachments of <HI>France;</HI> if <HI>France</HI> was augmented with the Province of <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> which is fertile of every Species of Provi&s;ions, &s;he would then be able to maintain in <HI>North America</HI> a numerous &s;tanding Army.</P>
<P>The <HI>New England</HI> Colonies, in every Period of this Provinces's Subjection to the <HI>French,</HI> continually felt mo&s;t pernicious Effects from it, in Depredations upon their Trade, and Incur&s;ions into their Territories; &s;o that in 1654 <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> for their Protection, was obliged to &s;eize on all its Forts and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>French</HI> of the whole Country: After the Re&s;titution of it to them by the Treaty of <HI>Breda, New England</HI> again ex|perienced the &s;ame mi&s;chievous Con&s;equences from their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, which always threatned De&s;truction to her Colonies: And not to mention the intermediate Ex|peditions form'd again&s;t it from tho&s;e Governments, and the alternate Change of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it has undergone; when <HI>France</HI> was &s;unk to its lowe&s;t Ebb of Power in <HI>Europe,</HI> by a long Series of adver&s;e Campaigns, during Queen <HI>Ann</HI>'s Reign, yet even then the <HI>New-England</HI> Go|vernments were &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by this Province's remain|ing in the Hands of the <HI>French</HI> (though the Number of its Inhabitants did not exceed 4000), that they twice addre&s;&s;ed the Crown in the &s;tronge&s;t Terms to &s;it out an Armament from <HI>England</HI> for the Re-conque&s;t of it; in con&s;equence of which an Expedition was formed a|gain&s;t it, under the Command of General <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> who took it: And the Negociations at the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> by which it was ceded to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> will &s;hew with what extreme Reluctance <HI>France</HI> made the Ce&s;&s;ion; and that nothing but the feeble State, &s;he was then in, could have reduced her to &s;ubmit to it.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="008258_0008_102DE8C3AE27A0C8">
By the Ce&s;&s;ion of this Province, and <HI>Placentia</HI> in <HI>New|foundland,</HI> to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> were left without any Harbour, or Sea Coa&s;t in that Part of the <HI>Atlantic</HI> Ocean; in Con&s;ideration of which the Land of Cape <HI>Breton,</HI> which lay within the ancient Limits of <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> or <HI>Acadie,</HI> but was excepted by the Treaty of <HI>Utretcht</HI> out of the Ce&s;&s;ion, was yielded to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>This I&s;land, or rather Collection of I&s;lands, called by the <HI>French Les I&s;les de Madame,</HI> which lie &s;o con|tiguous, that they are commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be but one, and comprehended under the Name of the I&s;land of Cape <HI>Breton,</HI> or <HI>L' I&s;le Royale,</HI> has a Sea Coa&s;t upon the <HI>At|lantic</HI> Ocean extending from the Gut of <HI>Can&s;o,</HI> the Ea&s;tern Boundary of <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> about 34 Leagues E. N. E. to the Entrance into the Gulf of <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> between the Ea&s;ter mo&s;t Part of the I&s;land, and the We&s;t of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> from which it is about 17&frac12; Leagues di&s;tant: Its We&s;tern Side forms Part of the Gulf; and the Importance of it to the <HI>French</HI> may be e&s;timated from the Advantages which they have reaped from it &s;ince it has been in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Altho' the Harbour of <HI>Louisbourg</HI> is not a very good one for Shipping, and the I&s;land is barren; and but a &s;mall Number of Ships fi&s;h there, in Compari&s;on of tho&s;e which are employed in the <HI>French</HI> Fi&s;heries on the Banks of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> the Gulf of <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> and the neighbouring Shores, Bays, Harbours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet the Situation of it is &s;uch, that all their fi&s;hing Ve&s;&s;els can repair thither on any Danger or Emergency; e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e which fi&s;h in the Gulf, on the <HI>Main,</HI> or at the Northwe&s;t of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> none of which are a|bove one or two Days Sail, at mo&s;t, from <HI>Louisbourg;</HI> as may al&s;o tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els which load with Mud-Fi&s;h on the Banks; &s;o that this I&s;land is the Center and Protecti|on of their whole Fi&s;hery: And of what Value that has been to them will appear by the following Computation taken of it from Per&s;ons intimately acquainted with eve|ry Branch of it, according to the State, in which it was carried on, this Year before the War.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="008258_0009_102DE8C552F16D20">
According to this Computation the Quantity of their Fi&s;h caught that Year was 1,149,000 Quintals of dry Fi&s;h, and 3,900,000 Mud-Fi&s;h; the Value of both which, including 3,116&frac14; Ton of Train Oil drawn from the Blubber, amounts to 926,577 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> according to the prime Co&s;t of the Fi&s;h at <HI>Newfoundland;</HI> and with the Addition of its Freight to the &s;everal Markets, where it is &s;old, makes 949,192 <HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> Sterling; and, if to this is added the Con&s;umption, which is made of their coar&s;e Woollens by the Men employed in the Fi&s;hery, reckon|ing for each a Blanket, Watch Coat, Rug, Pea-Jacket, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the Whole 30<HI>s. per</HI> Man, as al&s;o the Brandy they con&s;ume, together with the Canvas, Cordage, Nets, Hooks, Grapplins, Anchors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that the Ships and Shallops of this Fi&s;hery mu&s;t expend at Sea and on Shore, the Va|lue of it will amount at lea&s;t to one Million Sterling <HI>per Annum,</HI> at which it is generally computed.</P>
<P>But in order to form a ju&s;t E&s;timate of the Value of this Branch of Trade to the <HI>French,</HI> the Con&s;ideration of its beneficial Con&s;equences &s;hould be taken in; the&s;e con&s;i&s;t principally in the following Articles:</P>
<P>1&s;t, The Train Oil produced by it is nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>French</HI> in their Woolen Manufactory; in which they have already rival'd us with too much Succe&s;s; and their Sugar Colonies abroad, which cannot do without it, are &s;upplied with it from <HI>France</HI> out of this Fi&s;hery.</P>
<P>2dly, The Trade, it opens for them into the <HI>Mediter|ranean,</HI> and all the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick States, where they carry their Fi&s;h to Market, and by the Means of it force a Vent for other <HI>French</HI> Manufactures; which has been found &s;o beneficial to their commercial Intere&s;t, that they have been indefatigable in the Cultivation of it, &s;paring no Pains nor Co&s;t, and u&s;ing every Art to monopolize it; for which Purpo&s;e, from the Beginning they have u&s;ed their utmo&s;t Endeavours in time of War between the two Nations, to procure a Neutrality in <HI>North America,</HI> &s;o far as relates to the Fi&s;hery there; that they might even then carry it on, and pro&s;ecute their Voyages unmole&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="008258_0010_102DE8C6FA3411F8">
3dly, The great Increa&s;e of their Navigation and Seamen ari&s;ing from this Fi&s;hery; in which 564 Ships, be&s;ides Shallops, and 27,500 Seamen are employed; Circum&s;tances, e&s;pecially the latter, which con&s;idered with regard to their maritime Force, are of them&s;elves as valuable to <HI>France</HI> as the Revenue of the Fi&s;hery it|&s;elf: Well therefore might Pere <HI>Charlevoix</HI> in his Hi&s;|tory of <HI>New-France</HI> ob&s;erve, <Q>That this Fi&s;hery was a more valuable Source of Wealth and Power to <HI>France,</HI> than even the Mines of <HI>Peru</HI> or <HI>Mexico</HI> would be.</Q></P>
<P>And this great Branch of Trade may be &s;aid to depend upon their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the I&s;land of Cape <HI>Breton,</HI> as it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to carry it on without &s;ome con|venient Harbour of Strength to &s;upply and protect it; and <HI>Louisbourgh</HI> is the only one, they have in this Part of the <HI>Atlantic</HI> Ocean.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Fi&s;hery, there are likewi&s;e other Advan|tages which ari&s;e to the <HI>French</HI> from their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this I&s;land; <HI>France</HI> has not one Sea Port for the Relief and Shelter of her trading Ships either to, or from the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> or <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> open to them any where in <HI>North America,</HI> to the Northward of the River <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,</HI> ex|cept <HI>Louisbourg;</HI> and of con&s;equence, that whole Trade would be expos'd to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Privateers from the Northern Colonies in time of War, without any Place to retreat to; and in time of Peace, they would be with|out any Sea Port, they can call their own, or lay any Preten&s;ions to in tho&s;e Seas; but <HI>Louisbourg</HI> &s;erves them as an Harbour for their Ships employed in this Trade to re&s;ort to for Wood and Water, to clean or repair, for Convoy from thence to <HI>Old France,</HI> and on occa&s;ion of any Di&s;tre&s;s; as it likewi&s;e does to their Ve&s;&s;els to and from <HI>Canada,</HI> by having the Cover and Command of great Part of the Gulf of St. <HI>Lawrence;</HI> without which Protection and Retreat their Trade from thence, and even the Country it&s;elf, would not be worth the Expence, which <HI>France</HI> is at for the Maintenance of them.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="008258_0011_102DE8C9930B7918">
To all this mu&s;t be added, that the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this I&s;land puts it into their Power to annoy the Trade of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Northern Colonies in time of War with their Privateers from this Harbour, to &s;o great a Degree, that it has ever been called by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the <HI>Dunquerque</HI> of <HI>North-America.</HI></P>
<P>From the foregoing Enumeration of the Advantages accruing to the <HI>French</HI> from <HI>their</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this I&s;land, it is obvious of what Importance the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it would be to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> when the <HI>French</HI> are intirely excluded from the Cod Fi&s;hery; which they mu&s;t be, when they lo&s;e Cape <HI>Breton,</HI> and are not allowed any Privilege at <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> would have the whole Benefit of it to them&s;elves; in which Ca&s;e all the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholic States mu&s;t then depend on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;olely for their Baccalio; which, be&s;ides the Profits ari&s;ing immediately from it, would give them almo&s;t the whole Trade of the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> with an Increa&s;e of 27,000 Seamen for the Royal Navy, and put it ab&s;olutely in their Power to cut off all Communication between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Canada,</HI> except through the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i|&s;ippi</HI> (as is before ob&s;erved) and threby not only render <HI>Canada</HI> of little or no Utility to the <HI>French,</HI> but de|prive it of all effectual Support from <HI>France,</HI> again&s;t any Attempts of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for the Reduction of it.</P>
<P>From the State of the&s;e two Colonies it is clear, what the Difference would have been to <HI>Great Britain</HI> in the Cour&s;e of this War, if in&s;tead of the Pre&s;ervation of <HI>No|va Scotia</HI> and Reduction of Cape <HI>Breton, &s;he</HI> had lo&s;t the former to the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>they</HI> had kept Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the latter: In that Ca&s;e, <HI>France</HI> by gaining the prin|cipal Key of the Northern Colonies, extending her Sea Coa&s;t 90 Leagues further upon the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> and aug|menting her Territories in <HI>Canada,</HI> and the I&s;land of Cape <HI>Breton</HI> with &s;o large a Provi&s;ion Country as <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> lying contiguous to both of them, would have had it in her Power to introduce and &s;upport a Body of regular Troops there, which in Conjunction with the
<PB N="17" REF="008258_0012_102DE8CBB04383B8">Militia of <HI>Canada</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> upon the Continent (every one of which, the Six Nations not excepted, would &s;oon then have gone over to their Intere&s;t) would over|run the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies already &s;urrounded with a Line of <HI>French</HI> Forts carried on upon the Back of them for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>If ever <HI>Great Britain</HI> &s;hould receive &s;uch a Blow in her <HI>American</HI> Dominions, it would be in vain to hope to retrieve it by her &s;uperior Naval Force; on the other hand, if it is con&s;idered, how much the Strength of the <HI>French Marine</HI> would be thereby increa&s;ed, and that of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dimini&s;hed, little doubt can be made, that the pre&s;ent Superiority of the Naval Force of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to that of <HI>France</HI> would &s;urvive the Lo&s;s of her Colonies but a few Years.</P>
<P>Upon the Ce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> to <HI>Great Britain</HI> at the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> it was garri&s;oned with nine Companies of the late Lieutenant General <HI>Philips</HI>'s Re|giment of 31 privates each, five of which were po&s;ted at <HI>Annapolis Royal</HI> and four at <HI>Can&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>French</HI> Inhabitants (whom for di&s;tinction|&s;ake I &s;hall call <HI>Acadians</HI>) which were found in the Pro|vince at the Reduction of it, they were by the Treaty allowed their Option either to retire with their moveable Effects to any other Place within a Year, or to remain there and be &s;ubject to the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and to have the free Exerci&s;e of the Catholic Religion, as far as the Laws of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> would allow.</P>
<P>Much the greate&s;t Part made their Election to remain in <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> but could not be induced to take the Oath of Allegiance, pleading in Excu&s;e, that if they bound them&s;elves to take up Arms in defence of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government, they &s;hould be expo&s;ed to be made a Sacrifice to the Ravages of the <HI>Indians</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t: Upon this Plea General <HI>Phillips,</HI> then Gover|nor of the Province, permitted them to &s;tay there for &s;ome Years without giving this Te&s;t of their Allegiance; but at length, to bring them to comply, he indulged them,
<PB N="18" REF="008258_0013_102DE8CECF34A3A0">(though without being authoriz'd, as appears, by the Crown,) with an Exemption from bearing Arms upon any Occa&s;ion whatever; they were likewi&s;e not only allow|ed the public Profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Religion, but &s;uf|fered to be &s;upplied with <HI>French</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries from <HI>Ca|nada,</HI> who under the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Quebec</HI> exerci&s;ed Rule over them in &s;ecular as well as &s;piritual Matters, enfor|cing an Obedience to their Deci&s;ions and Mandates by the Infliction of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Penalties; whil&s;t the only, or at lea&s;t principal Act of Government exerci&s;ed by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Governor among them &s;eems to have been, the Appointment, or rather Allowance from time to time, of Deputies cho&s;en by and among them&s;elves for their &s;e|veral Di&s;tricts; and even tho&s;e frequently behaved in the Execution of their Office, as if they thought them|&s;elves &s;carcely accountable to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government for the Exerci&s;e of that Authority.</P>
<P>By this means, though the&s;e Inhabitants became <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Subjects by Virtue of the Treaty and their Oath of Allegiance; yet the <HI>French</HI> Governor in <HI>Canada</HI> pre|&s;erved the chief Influence and Command over them, and cultivated in them their former hereditary Attachment to the <HI>French</HI> King; &s;o that they continued a di&s;tinct Body of <HI>French Roman</HI> Catholics, exempted by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government from bearing Arms in Defence of it; and kept by their Prie&s;ts &s;o unmixed with and &s;eparate from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that but two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Families could &s;ettle among them, tho' &s;everal had attempted it; the Con&s;e|quence of all which was, that the Increa&s;e of the&s;e <HI>Aca|dians,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;trengthening the King's Government, as they naturally ought to have done, became dangerous to it; and by remaining in the Province were of much greater Service to <HI>France,</HI> than if they had removed into the <HI>French</HI> Government immediately after the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> as they were a growing Stock in <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> for &s;ettling it with <HI>French</HI> Inhabitants, even whil&s;t it was in the Hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and at the &s;ame time con|tributed to the Growth of Cape <HI>Breton</HI> by &s;upplying it

<P>In the mean time the I&s;land of Cape <HI>Breton,</HI> which it appears from the Negotiations of the Treaty of <HI>U|trecht, France</HI> had it much at Heart to obtain the ex|clu&s;ive Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, was immediately begun to be forti|fied and &s;ettled with <HI>French</HI> Inhabitants, in doing which no Co&s;ts or Pains was &s;pared: A new Colony was &s;et on foot to con&s;i&s;t of Fi&s;hermen only with &s;uitable Encou|ragement; the Town of <HI>Louisbourg</HI> was built and gar|ri&s;oned: the Harbour made at an immen&s;e Charge al|mo&s;t impregnable; and the Place became &s;o national an Object, that it was valued by <HI>France</HI> equal to any one other of her Colonies; and the Fi&s;hery flouri&s;hed &s;o fa&s;t, that they could &s;oon afford to under&s;ell the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at foreign Markets: for the Protection of this Trade, Ships of War were annually &s;ent from <HI>France,</HI> to vi&s;it and &s;upply the Settlers and Fi&s;hery with what they wanted, and had Orders not only to protect and defend the Sea Coa&s;ts of this I&s;land and the Gulf of St. <HI>Law|rence,</HI> and their Ve&s;&s;els upon the Banks of <HI>Newfound|land,</HI> &amp;c. from In&s;ults, but to keep up their Preten&s;ions to the &s;everal Banks either <HI>within</HI> or <HI>without</HI> their Line, and <HI>make</HI> to them&s;elves a Privilege of Fi&s;hing where they plea&s;ed, by force of Cu&s;tom: And &s;o early were the&s;e Encroachments on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Can&s;o,</HI> and upon the fi&s;hing Banks along the Sea Coa&s;t of <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> (from which <HI>France</HI> was wholly excluded by an expre&s;s Article in the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI>) that it was found ne|ce&s;&s;ary to have one of the King's Ships &s;ent every Year from <HI>England,</HI> and &s;tation'd at <HI>Can&s;o</HI> to guard again&s;t them: And to &s;uch a Pitch had the <HI>French</HI> advanced the Trade, Shipping and Settlements of this I&s;land by the Year 1744, that upon the breaking out of the War, Mr. <HI>Duque&s;nel</HI> then Governor of the Colony, within three Days after the Declaration of it arrived from <HI>France,</HI>

<P>Among the Artifices practi&s;ed by the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Can|ada,</HI> for paving their Way to regain the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> and &s;eize the fir&s;t Opportunity for that Purpo&s;e; the following may &s;erve as a remarkable Spe|cimen: A &s;hort Time before the Declaration of War, and when the Colonies were in full Expectation of it, the <HI>French</HI> procured the <HI>Indians</HI> of St. <HI>John</HI>'s River to &s;end a Deputation of their principal Men to the Com|mander in Chief of <HI>Annapolis Royal,</HI> on pretence of re|newing the Covenant of Peace and Amity with his Go|vernment (which was accordingly done with the u&s;ual <HI>Indian</HI> Formalities) but in reality to lull the Governor into a fal&s;e Security with re&s;pect to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and at the &s;ame time gain Admittance into the Fort, in order to di&s;cover the State of it, and hold them&s;elves in readi|ne&s;s to attack it, upon the fir&s;t Summons; which they did, and together with the other <HI>Indians</HI> of their River compo&s;ed Part of the Body, which inve&s;ted the Fort under the Command of <HI>Le Loutre.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Notice, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had of <HI>Can&s;o</HI>'s being taken and burnt, was brought to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> by a Fi&s;herman, who had de&s;cried, as he was fi&s;hing upon a Bank oppo&s;ite the I&s;land, a Cloud of Smoke ri&s;ing from &s;ome Ruins; and at the &s;ame time mi&s;&s;ed the Sight of the Block-hou&s;e

<P>This Intelligence left the Governor and Council of the Province of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> no room to doubt from what Quarter the &s;udden Blow mu&s;t come, and that the War, which before was expected to break out &s;oon between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> had been pro|claimed in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>For this Succe&s;s <HI>Te Deum</HI> was &s;ung at <HI>Paris,</HI> and publick Rejoicings made, and a pompous Account of it was publi&s;hed in the <HI>French</HI> Papers; which, as the Con|que&s;t con&s;idered in it&s;elf appeared but &s;mall, was impu|ted to a Vanity of magnifying the &s;lighte&s;t Actions to the World; but <HI>France</HI> e&s;timated it from the Importance, which the De&s;truction of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fi&s;hery, and the Reduction of the whole Province of <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> would be of to her; and looked upon her Succe&s;s again&s;t <HI>Can&s;o</HI> as a &s;ure Forerunner of the Reconque&s;t of the one, and the utter De&s;truction of the other; both which they had in View to accompli&s;h and that her Hopes were not without Foundation will appear from the State of the Province at this Juncture: The whole Defence of it, after the Reduction of <HI>Can&s;o,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted in the Fort of <HI>Annapolis Royal,</HI> the Works of which were of Earth reve&s;ted with Timber, but &s;o ruinous in &s;everal Parts, that the Cattle could walk over them into the Fort; and the Garri&s;on had not above 80 Men fit for Service, the re&s;t being &s;uperannuated, or Invalids.</P>

<P>Upon the Appearance of this Reinforcement in the Ba&s;in of <HI>Annapolis,</HI> and the Snow's &s;aluting the Fort with a Di&s;charge of its Cannon, the <HI>Indians</HI> were thrown into &s;uch Confu&s;ion and Panic, that they not only made a precipitate Retreat, and gave the Troops an Opportu|nity

<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e Preparations were making at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in the latter End of <HI>October,</HI> the Governor had Intelligence brought him by a Fi&s;herman from the I&s;le of <HI>Seals,</HI> that he had &s;een forty Hours before three <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;els &s;tanding up the Bay of <HI>Funda;</HI> the&s;e were found af|terwards to be a Banker of about 400 Ton with a Brig|antine and Sloop, which Mr. <HI>Duque&s;nel</HI> upon being di&s;appointed of A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Men of War had fit|ted out from <HI>Louisbourg</HI> in a warlike Manner, and or|der'd to proceed up the Bay of <HI>Funda</HI> with Ordnance Stores for attacking the Fort at <HI>Annapolis Royal</HI> by Sea, whil&s;t Mr. <HI>Duvivier,</HI> whom he &s;uppo&s;ed they would find before the Fort, attacked it by Land; whereupon the <HI>Governor of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay</HI> di&s;patched, the Day following, a Schooner to Mr. <HI>Ma&s;carene</HI> with Ad|vice of the De&s;igns of the <HI>French,</HI> and A&s;&s;urances that he would &s;end the three armed Ve&s;&s;els before-mentioned, all well appointed, in four Days to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;els accordingly arrived at the Nar|rows below the Ba&s;in of <HI>Annapolis,</HI> where they came to an Anchor till they could get Information whether Mr. <HI>Duvivier,</HI> was &s;till before the Fort: Two Days after, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Schooner, which carried the Di&s;pat|ches for Mr. <HI>Ma&s;carene,</HI> incautiou&s;ly fell in among them in the Night Time; and the Ma&s;ter in his Sur|prize &s;uffered the Governor's Di&s;patches to fall into the Enemy's Hands; the Effect of this was, that the <HI>French</HI> Commodore finding Mr. <HI>Duvivier</HI> had retired from be|fore the Fort, and that a Naval Force was coming after him from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> cut his Cable and immediately quit|ted the Bay, and by that means e&s;caped the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts Ve&s;&s;els,</HI> which entered the Bay &s;oon after he had got out of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Ve&s;&s;els upon their Arrival at <HI>Annapolis Royal</HI> attempted to look into the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of

<P>Mr. <HI>Duvivier</HI> having retired to <HI>Minas,</HI> the Com|pany of Rangers was po&s;ted without the Fort, under the Cover of the Cannon, and &s;ecured by &s;uch further De|fence, as could be immediately rai&s;ed with Pickets and other &s;light Works; which manner of po&s;ting them was better adapted for the Service they were to be employed in, at the &s;ame time, that it was more agreeable to them than to be lodged in Barracks within the Fort.</P>
<P>Before their Arrival, the Garri&s;on was confined with|in the Walls of the Fort, &s;o that the Spot upon which it &s;tood might ju&s;tly be &s;aid to be the only one in the Province, which they were Ma&s;ters of: But the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> under the Management of Officers who under&s;tood the proper U&s;e of them, and to who&s;e Or|ders they were perfectly obedient, &s;oon freed it from that Re&s;traint, and were in many other Re&s;pects of in|finite Service to it: By their &s;udden Excur&s;ions (fre|quently made in the Night Time) into different Parts of the Province either by Land Marches, or De&s;cents in their Row-Gallies, they gained Intelligence of the Mo|tions of the Enemy, and &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence kept up between them and the Inhabitants, and, when Occa&s;ion required, &s;eized &s;uch of the latter, as appeared to be Ringleaders and the mo&s;t dangerous among them; by which means, and &s;ometimes by &s;urprizing Parties of the

<P>To the&s;e timely Reinforcements and Succours, the <HI>Governor</HI> and his Maje&s;ty's <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> in their Letter of Thanks to the <HI>Governor of the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts Bay</HI> impute the Pre&s;ervation of his Maje&s;ty's Garri&s;on and the whole Province from falling into the Enemy's Hands that Year; and his Maje&s;ty, upon hav|ing an Account of the Proceedings for the Pre&s;ervation of the Province laid before him, was plea&s;ed in Council to declare his Royal Approbation of <HI>his</HI> Conduct there|in, and that his Maje&s;ty would &s;tand to the Engagements which <HI>he</HI> had made upon this Occa&s;ion in his Name; and a Copy of his Maje&s;ty's Royal Declaration was ac|cordingly tran&s;mitted to <HI>him</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> under the Seal of the Council Office.</P>

<P>The <HI>French</HI> Governor, upon receiving this Propo&s;al, acquainted the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers with it; and let them know, he &s;hould accede to it, upon their giving their Pa|role, that neither they nor the Soldiers &s;hould &s;erve again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> for the Space of one Year after the Expiration of that, for which they had agreed by the Ar|ticles of Capitulation to remain Pri&s;oners: And upon their objecting to it, he told them, that as their remain|ing at <HI>Louisbourg</HI> would be inconvenient, he &s;hould, if they did not accept of the&s;e new Terms, be obliged to &s;end them to <HI>Quebec,</HI> from whence it would be impracti|cable

<P>Though the <HI>French</HI> Governor's exacting from the Officers this new Agreement, whereby the King was to be deprived of the Service of his Troops one Year lon|ger than they had &s;urrendered them&s;elves for, was a manife&s;t Infringement of the Articles of the Capitula|tion, and what the Officers had no right to con&s;ent to; yet they thought it for his Maje&s;ty's Service to &s;ubmit to it; and accordingly gave their Parole; upon which the Troops were &s;ent to <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Arrival of the Officers there the <HI>Governor of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> gained &s;uch Intelligence of the State of <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> as with other Motives induced <HI>him</HI> to entertain a De&s;ign of forming an Expedition a|gain&s;t it early in the &s;ucceeding Year.</P>
<P>The&s;e Motives were as follows:</P>
<P>With regard to the State of <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> it appeared that the Garri&s;on and Inhabitants mu&s;t be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in a &s;hort Time for want of Provi&s;ions, having been a few Weeks before exhau&s;ted by furni&s;hing the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Fleet and Squadron, which convoyed it, with Supplies for pro&s;ecuting their Voyage to <HI>France.</HI>&mdash;That the Troops of the Garri&s;on, which con&s;i&s;ted only of &s;ix Companies of Marines and one <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> of 100 Men each were &s;hort of Complement, and badly di&s;ciplined, the whole greatly di&s;contented, and the Company of <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> very mutinous; that the Inhabitants were but few, and mo&s;t of them unacquainted with the U&s;e of Fire Arms; that &s;everal Parts of the Fortifications were out of Re|pair, particularly the Grand Battery, which had one End almo&s;t open, occa&s;ioned by a new Work's being unfini&s;hed, and many other Parts of it extremely low, and the whole commanded by a Hill clo&s;e behind it.&mdash; That Mr. <HI>Dutchambon,</HI> who &s;ucceeded Mr. <HI>Duque&s;|nel,</HI> then lately dead, as Governor of the Colony, was wholly un&s;killed in the Defence of a Fortification, the Engineer ab&s;ent, and the other Officers not much u&s;ed
<PB N="32" REF="008258_0027_102DE8F01194D6D8">to military Di&s;cipline; and that their Number of Troops was &s;o &s;mall, as put it intirely out of their Power to de|fend the &s;everal Parts, they were liable to be attacked in.&mdash;That though the Harbour was &s;trongly fortified, there were many convenient Places in <HI>Chapeau Rouge Bay</HI> for landing Troops, Cannon and Stores on the back Side of <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> free from any Annoyance, and lay|ing up the Tran&s;ports in &s;uch manner, that the Troops might have it in their Power to Retreat to them upon an Emergency; that the City of <HI>Louisbourg</HI> had no Bat|teries upon the Land Side; and the Extent of it was &s;o &s;mall, that every Hou&s;e in it was expo&s;ed to the Bombs and Cannon of the Be&s;iegers; which mu&s;t oblige both Inhabitants and Soldiers when off Duty, to retire into the Ca&s;mates, that were extremely damp and unwhol&s;ome. &mdash;That the Grand Battery, which could not make any Defence by Land, and from the before-mentioned State of it appeared not to be tenable, when attacked on that Side, would probably be de&s;erted on the fir&s;t Approach of an Enemy; and that by getting Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and erecting Fa&s;cine Batteries near the Light|Hou&s;e, and in other convenient Places, it would be difficult, if not impracticable for any Ships to enter the Harbour again&s;t the Fire from them.&mdash;Upon all which Accounts it was extremely improbable that the Place &s;hould hold out long again&s;t a Body of 3 or 4000 Men without Succours from <HI>France,</HI> which might be pre|vented from receiving Intelligence of its Circum&s;tances in Time to &s;end it Relief, by the armed Ve&s;&s;els, which might be collected in the Colonies, and would be a &s;ufficient Force to intercept whatever might come from <HI>Canada,</HI> as al&s;o any Merchant Ships with Provi&s;ions from <HI>France</HI> in the Spring.</P>
<P>The other Motives, which induced the Governor to think of forming an immediate Expedition again&s;t it, were&mdash;That Mr. <HI>Duvivier</HI> was &s;ent by Mr. <HI>Duque&s;nel,</HI> a &s;hort Time before his Death, to <HI>France,</HI> in order to repre&s;ent to the Government the weak Condition of
<PB N="33" REF="008258_0028_102DE8F228ADAA70"><HI>Annapolis Royal,</HI> and State of the whole Province of <HI>Nova Scotia;</HI> and to procure an Armament from thence early the next Year to make an Attempt again&s;t it:&mdash; That the <HI>New-England Fi&s;hery</HI> was wholly de&s;troyed; as would likewi&s;e the Trade of the Northern Colonies be by the <HI>French</HI> Ships of War and Privateers from <HI>Louisbourg</HI> the Year following; that the Reduction of <HI>Louisbourg</HI> would be the mo&s;t effectual Means of &s;e|curing <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> re&s;toring the <HI>Engli&s;h Fi&s;hery,</HI> and de&s;troying that of the <HI>French,</HI> and protecting the Trade of the Colonies; and would facilitate the <HI>Conque&s;t of Canada</HI> it&s;elf, if that &s;hould be thought proper to be attempted in the &s;ucceeding Year: But in ca&s;e the Suc|ce&s;s of the Expedition &s;hould fall &s;hort of the Reduction of Cape <HI>Breton;</HI> yet the certain Effects of it would be the recovering of the I&s;land of <HI>Can&s;o,</HI> and the whole Fi&s;hery along the Coa&s;t as far as <HI>Newfoundland</HI> by de|&s;troying the Buildings, and breaking up all the Settle|ments and Fi&s;hery upon the I&s;land of Cape <HI>Breton;</HI> the cau&s;ing &s;uch a Diver&s;ion as would probably &s;ecure <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> for the following Year at lea&s;t; and the di&s;arm|ing the Harbour of <HI>Louisbourg</HI> of the Grand Battery; which would make it more practicable for the King's Ships to enter it, in ca&s;e a naval Armament &s;hould be &s;ent again&s;t it from <HI>England;</HI> all which would greatly over|pay the Expence of the Attempt.</P>
<P>It was not doubted, that the <HI>French</HI> would form ano|ther Attempt from <HI>Canada</HI> again&s;t <HI>Annapolis Royal</HI> early in the Spring; but as the Fort was then in a much bet|ter Po&s;ture of Defence by the Repairing of its old Works, and the Addition of new ones, and its Garri&s;on &s;trength|ened with the &s;everal Reinforcements &s;ent from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and it appeared probable to the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Governor,</HI> that the Expedition again&s;t Cape <HI>Breton,</HI> which he had determined to &s;et on Foot, would make a con&s;iderable Diver&s;ion in favour of it, he &s;ent no further Reinforce|ments to it that Year: Early in the Spring 1745, Mr. <HI>Marin,</HI> as was expected, inve&s;ted the fort with about
<PB N="34" REF="008258_0029_102DE8F423396138">1100 <HI>French Indians</HI> from <HI>Canada,</HI> but could make no Impre&s;&s;ion upon it; he continued however his Ho&s;tili|ties there, till the Landing of the <HI>New England</HI> Troops upon the I&s;land of Cape <HI>Breton,</HI> whereupon the <HI>French</HI> Governor found means to &s;end for him to come to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; which broke up the Siege of <HI>Annapolis Rayal,</HI> and ridded the Province of the Enemy for &s;ixteen Months.</P>
<P>About the Middle of <HI>January</HI> 1744-5 the <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts</HI> Governor recommended it in a Me&s;&s;age to the A&s;&s;embly to pro&s;ecute an Expedition again&s;t the I&s;land of Cape <HI>Breton</HI> early in the Spring.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly, upon the Secretary's laying the Me&s;|&s;age before them, bound their Members to Secrecy; and after three Days clo&s;e Deliberation upon it, &s;ent him an An&s;wer; the Sub&s;tance of which was, <Q>that they were &s;en&s;ible of the Nece&s;&s;ity there was for making an Attempt, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, for the Re|duction of the I&s;land of Cape <HI>Breton;</HI> but the Un|dertaking was too great for the Abilities of the Pro|vince, and prayed him to repre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty, how e&s;&s;ential it was for the Security of the Colonies and his Service in <HI>North-America,</HI> that an Expedition &s;hould be fitted out from <HI>England</HI> again&s;t this I&s;land, and that they were ready to contribute towards the Pro&s;ecution of it to the utmo&s;t of their Power.</Q></P>

<P>The Bounty, Pay, and other Encouragements allow|ed by the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Government to both Officers and Men, e&s;pecially the former, was &s;mall; but the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which reigned through the Province, &s;upplied the Want of that; the Complement of Troops was &s;oon Inli&s;ted; not only the Officers, who &s;erved in this Enter|prize, were Gentlemen of con&s;iderable Property; but mo&s;t of the Non-commi&s;&s;ioned Officers and many of the private Men had valuable Farms, and enter'd into the Service upon the &s;ame Principles that the old <HI>Roman</HI> Citizens in the fir&s;t Con&s;ular Armies u&s;ed to do, with a Re&s;olution to behave like Men, who were to fight <HI>pro aris et focis;</HI> which they were per&s;uaded was the Ca&s;e in this Enterprize.</P>

<PB N="40" REF="008258_0035_102E4F0491EF7228">was determined there to &s;upport the Expedition, and in con&s;equence of it his Maje&s;ty's Ships <HI>Pince&s;s Mary, Hector, Che&s;ter, Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>Sunderland</HI> were di&s;|patched with Orders to join Mr. <HI>Warren</HI>'s Squadron at <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> which they did during the Siege; in An&s;wer to the Di&s;patches &s;ent to Sir <HI>Chaloner Ogle</HI> at <HI>Jamaica</HI> Admiral <HI>Davers</HI> who relieved him, acquainted the Gover|nor, that he had pre&s;&s;ed him much to comply with the Pro|po&s;al of his Letter, but could not prevail on him to do it: And in An&s;wer to his Letter &s;ent to Mr. <HI>Warren</HI> at <HI>An|tigua,</HI> he received one from him, dated the 24th of <HI>February,</HI> inclo&s;ing a Copy of the Con&s;ultation of the Captains then pre&s;ent, held on Board the <HI>Launce&s;ton</HI> the 23d of <HI>February,</HI> in which was &s;et forth, <Q>That <HI>Commodore Warren</HI> having laid before them a Letter from Governor <HI>Shirley</HI> of his Maje&s;ty's Province of <HI>New-England,</HI> together with a Scheme for attacking and &s;urprizing the Fort and Town of <HI>Louisbourg</HI> and Cape <HI>Breton,</HI> reque&s;ting &s;ome of the Ships from that Station, to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, they had taken the &s;ame into their mature Con&s;ideration, and it appearing the &s;aid Scheme had been undertaken without fir&s;t receiving his Maje&s;ty's Approbation, and that no Orders had been &s;ent by the Lords of the Admiralty for any Ships giving their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that the taking any of the Ships off tho&s;e Stations (in the Room of the <HI>Wey|mouth,</HI> which had been unfortunately lo&s;t) would be a great weakening of tho&s;e I&s;lands, and could be of no great Service in &s;uch an Undertaking, and it might be attended with bad Con&s;equences, as a Squadron of the Enemy's Ships were daily expected at <HI>Matinique.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>They therefore unanimou&s;ly agreed and gave it as their Opinions, that it would be mo&s;t for his Maje&s;ty's Service for Commodore <HI>Warren</HI> to &s;end the <HI>North America</HI> &s;tationed Ships away to their re&s;pective Sta|tions, and remain there him&s;elf in the <HI>Superbe,</HI> till An&s;wers could return to his Expre&s;s from <HI>England</HI> by the <HI>Mercury,</HI> whom, it was their Advice to &s;end

<P>This Pacquet arriv'd at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> the Day before the <HI>New England</HI> Fleet failed from thence for <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> at which time the Governor was not certain that the Ex|pedition would be &s;upported with any of his Maje&s;ty's Ships; and as the Contents of it, if publickly known, could have had no good Effect for his Maje&s;ty's Service at that critical Conjuncture, he did not think it advi&s;eable to communicate them to the General A&s;&s;embly, or any Per&s;on whatever except the Commander in Chief of the Expedition, and the General Officer then next in Command to him.</P>
<P>A few Days after Mr. <HI>Warren</HI> had di&s;patched the Expre&s;s Boat back to <HI>New England,</HI> his Maje&s;ty's Sloop <HI>Hind</HI> arrived at <HI>Antigua</HI> with Orders for him to repair forthwith to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> <Q>with &s;uch of the Ships under his Command, as could be &s;pared from his Ma|je&s;ty's Service in the Parts where he was &s;tationed, in order to concert Mea&s;ures with Governor <HI>Shirley</HI> for the Protection of the Trade, Annoyance of the Ene|my, and his Maje&s;ty's <HI>General</HI> Service in <HI>North-A|merica.</HI></Q></P>

On the Day following a Detachment of 400 Men marched round to the North-ea&s;t Harbour, behind the Range of Hills there, and burnt all the Enemy's Hou|&s;es and Stores in the Neighbourhood, at the Di&s;tance of about a Mile from the Grand Battery; whereupon the Enemy de&s;erted it the &s;ame Night, leaving the Artille|ry, con&s;i&s;ting of 28 Cannon of 42 Pound Ball, and two of 18 Pound, with the Ordnance Stores (except their Powder, which they threw into a Well), &s;o precipitately, that they only &s;pik'd up their Cannon in a &s;light Man|ner, without knocking off the Trunnions, or doing other Damage to them, and but very little to the Carriages: The next Morning a Party of &s;ixteen Men di&s;covered, that the Enemy had abandoned the Grand Battery, and drove off a Party of them, as they were attempting to reland there that Morning in Boats.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the <HI>New England</HI> Men had taken Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Grand Battery, the <HI>French</HI> kept an ince&s;|&s;ant Fire again&s;t it with their Cannon and Bombs both from the Town and I&s;land Battery; the former of which is di&s;tant 5913 Feet from it, and the latter 4800; not|with&s;tanding which three Cannon in the Grand Battery, which pointed again&s;t the Town, were cleared by the Day following, and the Enemy's Fire was returned upon the Town from them, as was that from their I&s;land Bat|tery &s;oon after, by other Cannon, which pointed again&s;t it, and were drilled within a few Days.</P>
<P>The <HI>New England</HI> Troops, within the Compa&s;s of 23 Days from the time of their fir&s;t landing, erected five Fa&s;cine Batteries again&s;t the Town, mounted with Cannon of 42 lb. 22 lb. and 18 lb.

<P>Upon the Governor's Arrival at <HI>Louisbourg</HI> a ge|neral Joy appeared in the Troops, which was &s;till highten'd in the Men by an Expectation of having a &s;hort Day fix'd for their being relieved: on the other hand, the Nece&s;&s;ity which the Governor was under of di&s;appointing the&s;e Hopes in a grert mea&s;ure, was no &s;mall Embarra&s;sment to him: It was thought mo&s;t ad|vi&s;eable upon this Occa&s;ion, that he &s;hould &s;peak to every Regiment &s;eparately, and that Regiment &s;poke to fir&s;t, which was thought to be the lea&s;t di&s;contented; he ob|&s;erved to them, <Q>that it was a mo&s;t unrea&s;onable Notion, which he heard &s;ome had entertained, that the Ex|pedition was to end with the Siege and Surrender of <HI>Louisbourg;</HI> that they had entered into it, in order to make a Conque&s;t (which to their Honour they had happily effected) for the Service of their King and Country, not to abandon it immediately after to the Enemy: That for &s;ecuring the Benefit of it, it was nece&s;&s;ary a &s;ufficient Number of them &s;hould keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till they could be relieved by other Troops, which he hoped would &s;oon be done by &s;ome

<P>Late in the Afternoon before this De&s;ign was to be put in Execution, Information was given of it to the Governor; whereupon two or three of the Ring-leaders were &s;ecured, and the Men off Duty ordered into their Barracks.</P>

<P>The Conque&s;t of Cape <HI>Breton</HI> afforded the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> great Advantages for attempting the Reduction of <HI>Cana|da,</HI> as the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it together with <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> gave them the intire Command of the Gulf of St. <HI>Law|rence,</HI> and Entrance into the River <HI>Canada,</HI> &s;o that they had it then in their Power to cut off <HI>Quebec,</HI> in which con&s;i&s;ts the principal Strength of the Country, from re|ceiving any Support from <HI>France:</HI> Many other Circum|&s;tances likewi&s;e concurred to favour an Attempt again&s;t it the next Year.</P>
<P>It appeared from undoubted Accounts, that <HI>Niagara</HI> and <HI>Cadaraqui (Frontenac)</HI> were then &s;o weak, that the <HI>French</HI> were apprehen&s;ive, the fir&s;t News, they &s;hould hear would be, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had taken tho&s;e Forts; e&s;pecially as they could not &s;end a &s;ufficient Number of Men from <HI>Canada</HI> to defend them for want of Provi|&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Weakne&s;s of the latter of the&s;e Places was a mo&s;t material Circum&s;tance; as the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t Way then for carrying Troops into the Enemy's Country was by <HI>O&s;wego,</HI> acro&s;s Lake <HI>Ontario,</HI> and down the River <HI>Iro|quois</HI> (called by the <HI>French</HI> St. <HI>Lawrence</HI>) the Pa&s;&s;age through which to <HI>Montreal</HI> being with the Stream, may be made in four Days, and affords good Places for en|camping every Night free of Ambu&s;cades, with a &s;afe Landing for the Men upon the I&s;land of <HI>Montreal;</HI> from an Eminence on which, it is &s;aid, it may be ea&s;ily reduced in a few Hours; and there is be&s;ides a &s;mall I&s;land within Cannon Shot of the City, which was at that time without any Fortifications, and with not above twenty Inhabitants upon it, and being taken would have

<P>According to the be&s;t Information, the Number of fighting Men in all <HI>Canada,</HI> including their regular Troops, did not then exceed 12,000; nor their <HI>Indians,</HI> which they call <HI>Domicili&eacute;s,</HI> or Re&s;ident within <HI>Canada,</HI> 900: And what were e&s;teemed two very favourable Circum&s;tances were, that the Government of <HI>Canada</HI> was, at that time, &s;o jealous of the <HI>Indians</HI> of the Six Nations, that the <HI>French</HI> Traders were &s;trictly forbid to employ any of them in carrying their Goods over the <HI>Niagara</HI> Carrying-place, for fear they &s;hould take a|way their Powder, and then &s;eize upon the Fort; and that upon the Reduction of Cape <HI>Breton, Canada</HI> was look'd upon by the Inhabitants to be in &s;o de&s;perate a State, that it was thought, if it was made known there, that &s;uch of them, as would not take up Arms again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;hould be permitted upon the Reduction of the Country to remain there, and enjoy their E&s;tates and Fortunes, and that &s;uch, who did take up Arms, &s;hould be oblig'd to leave <HI>Canada,</HI> and forfeit their E&s;tates, not one Man in ten would appear in Arms.</P>
<P>The Governor therefore concerted Mea&s;ures with the General and Mr. <HI>Warren,</HI> then lately made Admiral <HI>Warren,</HI> who both agreed with him in Sentiment, for forming an Attempt again&s;t it the next Year; and before his leaving <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> he and the Admiral propo&s;ed the making one in a joint Letter to his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;|ters for their Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> the 30.

<P>The Spring following an Expedition by Land and Sea was formed by his Maje&s;ty's Orders in <HI>England</HI> for the Reduction of <HI>Canada,</HI> under the Command of Lieut.

<P>Upon this Occa&s;ion the general Plan, which had been concerted in <HI>England</HI> for that Service, was tran&s;mitted to the Governor of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Bay, with his Maje&s;ty's Orders to him, that upon the Arrival of Lieut.

<P>By the Plan &s;ent from <HI>England</HI> it was propo&s;ed that the Troops to be rai&s;ed in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, New Hamp&s;hire, Connecticut,</HI> and <HI>Rhode I&s;land</HI> &s;hould ren|dezvous at <HI>Louisbourg</HI> as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and proceed up the River <HI>St. Lawrence</HI> with his Maje&s;ty's Ships and the regular Troops to <HI>Quebec;</HI> and tho&s;e rai&s;ed in the Colonies of <HI>New York, Pen&s;ilvania, Maryland</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI> &s;hould rendezvous at <HI>Albany,</HI> in order to pro|ceed from thence acro&s;s the Country by Land to <HI>Mont|real,</HI> as &s;oon as they &s;hould receive Intelligence that his Maje&s;ty's Ships had entered the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> and form the Siege of that Place.</P>
<P>As to the particular Number of Men to be rai&s;ed in any of the Provinces, that was not limited by his Ma|je&s;ty; but it was &s;ignified in his In&s;tructions to his Go|vernors,
<PB N="62" REF="008258_0057_102E4F3FB7717F28">that his Maje&s;ty hoped the Troops, which &s;hould be rai&s;ed in the &s;everal Colonies, would amount in the whole to at lea&s;t 5000.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Preparations were making in <HI>England</HI> and the the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>North America</HI> for pro&s;ecuting this Enterprize, the <HI>French</HI> were employed in fitting out an Armament from <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> which, in Conjunction with a Body of Land Forces to be rai&s;ed in <HI>Canada,</HI> was de&s;tined for the Reduction of <HI>Nova Scotia.</HI></P>

<P>The Colony Troops were rai&s;ed with great Di&s;patch; and, though the Packets containing his Maje&s;ty's Orders for the &s;everal Governors did not arrive at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> till the latter End of <HI>May,</HI> yet the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> Forces with their Tran&s;ports were got ready to proceed to <HI>Loui&s;|bourg</HI> by the Middle of <HI>July.</HI></P>

<P>Exclu&s;ive of this, there were two other very &s;trong Rea&s;ons for making this Attempt; the We&s;tern Fron|tiers of <HI>New England</HI> and the Province of <HI>New York</HI> as far as the City of <HI>Albany,</HI> had experienced mo&s;t mi&s;|chievous Effects from this Fort; it &s;erved the <HI>French</HI> as a Place of Rendezvous to fit out Parties from, both of <HI>Canadeans</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> to make Incur&s;ions and Depre|dations upon the adjacent Territories of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which they had greatly galled even during that War, burning and de&s;troying the whole Village of <HI>Sarahtoga,</HI> and Fort <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> it&s;elf; and was likewi&s;e a Place of Safety for them, upon their Retreat from any of the&s;e Enterprizes: It was be&s;ides ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to em|ploy as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible the <HI>Indians</HI> of the Six Nations, who were much depended upon for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance in this Attempt; as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had lo&s;t their good Opini|on and Re&s;pect, together with their former Attachment to their Intere&s;t in nothing more than &s;uffering the <HI>French</HI> to build this Fort, &s;o nothing could more retrieve their Influence over them, and all the <HI>Indians</HI> depen|dent upon them, than the Reduction of it: The Acqui|&s;ition therefore of this Fort, in ca&s;e even of the other Parts of the Expedition's being dropped or attended with Misfortune in the Pro&s;ecution of it, would in a great mea&s;ure, of it&s;elf, recompen&s;e the Northern Co|lonies for their Expence in it.</P>

<P>However, the general Alarm which had been occa&s;i|oned by the Appearance of the <HI>French</HI> Armament upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> had &s;u&s;pended the Pro&s;ecution of the intended Attempt till the Sea&s;on of the Year was &s;o far advanced, that one or more of the Colonies con|cerned in it judged it too late to proceed, and refu&s;ed to join with the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay;</HI> and a Di&s;union of Councils in this Point finally prevented its being carried into Execution.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>De Ram&s;ay</HI> &s;till remained in <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> with about 500 <HI>Canadians</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> Part in <HI>Chiegnecto</HI> and Part at <HI>Minas;</HI> the Inhabitants of the former of

<P>There appeared Danger in this Scheme; had Mr. <HI>De Ram&s;ay</HI> been &s;uffer'd to go on unmole&s;ted in his Practices upon the Inhabitants during the whole Winter, what Effects he might have wrought on &s;ome of them by his Per&s;wa&s;ions, upon others by Menaces, was uncer|tain; but if he had &s;ucceeded, it mu&s;t have hazarded the Lo&s;s of the whole Province by the en&s;uing Spring: To counteract therefore Mr. <HI>De Ram&s;ay</HI> and fru&s;trate his De&s;igns, the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Governor</HI> determined, though the Winter was then far advanced, to attempt driving him out of <HI>Minas,</HI> as &s;oon as a fre&s;h Recruit of Troops could be &s;ent to <HI>Annapolis Royal.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, to prevent him from making any Progre&s;s in gaining over the Inhabitants, he immediately tran&s;mitted from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> to Governor <HI>Ma&s;carene</HI> a Num|ber of printed Copies of a Declaration tran&s;lated into <HI>French,</HI> and &s;igned by him&s;elf, to be di&s;per&s;ed through|out the Di&s;tricts of <HI>Minas</HI> and <HI>Annapolis River;</HI> where|in he a&s;&s;ured the Deputies and Inhabitants, <Q>that &s;uch of them as &s;hould remain firm in their Allegiance to his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be protected in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Lands and ju&s;t Rights, according to the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht;</HI> letting them know at the &s;ame time, that he &s;hould very &s;oon &s;end a &s;ufficient Force to <HI>Minas</HI>

<P>The <HI>French</HI> Commander upon having Intelligence of their Arrival at <HI>Annapolis,</HI> and their Embarkation for <HI>Minas,</HI> had quitted the Di&s;trict and retired with his Par|ty to <HI>Schiegnecto,</HI> the extreme Part of the Penin|&s;uln: The Sea&s;on being extremely &s;evere hindered the <HI>New England</HI> Men from immediately following him

<P>On the la&s;t Day of <HI>January</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Commander having gained Intelligence of their being di&s;tributed in Quarters at a great Di&s;tance from each other, and being &s;ecretly encouraged with the Promi&s;e of A&s;&s;i&s;tance from &s;ome of the Inhabitants, made a March, which was tho't impracticable in that Sea&s;on of the Year, through the Woods with a Party of <HI>Canadians</HI> and <HI>Indians;</HI> and taking the Advantage of a violent Snow Storm, which had la&s;ted 36 Hours, entered the Town immediatly af|ter, at Midnight, and &s;urrounded mo&s;t of them in their Quarters; the greate&s;t Part of whom were killed, worm|ded or taken Pri&s;oners: In the mean time, tho&s;e Par|ties which were not &s;urrounded, marched out and forced their Way through the Enemy to the Guard-Hou&s;e, being a large defen&s;ible Stone Building, &s;ituated in the middle of the Town; and &s;ome others, which had been &s;urrounded, beat off the Party which attacked them and recovered it: The next Morning two Companies marched out of the Guard-Hou&s;e to make an Attempt upon the Enemy's head Quarters, but having been &s;urprized without their Snow Shoes, and finding in the March, that the Snow was too much drifted for them to reach the Enemy, after having made two Di&s;|charges of Mu&s;quetry upon them, they were obliged to de&s;i&s;t from their Attempt: The Day following Mr. <HI>La Corne,</HI> who then commanded the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> propo&s;ed a Parley, which was agreed to; and afterwards that each &s;hould bury their Dead; Terms of Capitula|tion were then offered to the <HI>New England</HI> Men; the Sub&s;tance of which was, that upon &s;urrendering the Fort, they &s;hould have leave to march out with Drums beating and Colours flying, and other u&s;ual Honours of War; a &s;ufficient Quantity of Ammunition and Provi&s;ions allow|ed to &s;erve them in their March back to <HI>Annapolis;</HI> and Nece&s;&s;aries for carrying off their Sick and Wounded; the <HI>New England</HI> Troops to quit <HI>Minas,</HI> and not to

<P>Upon this a Council of War was held, and the Gar|ri&s;on &s;ubmitted to the Terms propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The killed, wounded and Pri&s;oners taken in this Action by the <HI>French</HI> amounted to about 160, and the Number of <HI>Canadians</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> killed and wounded by the <HI>New England</HI> Men was computed at between 50 and 60.</P>
<P>The <HI>New England</HI> Men being thus obliged to retire, Mr. <HI>La Corne</HI> quitted <HI>Minas</HI> in afew Days, leaving the Command of a &s;mall Party there with an inferior Officer.</P>
<P>Upon gaining this Advantage Mr. <HI>De Ram&s;ay</HI> &s;ent Declarations to the <HI>French</HI> Inhabitants in the Name of the <HI>Governor of Canada,</HI> which were publicly po&s;ted up, requiring them to take up Arms, whenever they &s;hould be call'd upon by him, again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> on pain of Death, having their Hou&s;es burnt, and their E&s;tates con|fi&s;cated; and with the&s;e he publi&s;h'd the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Quebec</HI>'s Declaration, pronouncing them ab&s;olv'd from their former Oaths of Fidelity to the King of <HI>Great Bri|tain:</HI> On the other hand the <HI>Governor of the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ets Bay,</HI> to cut off all Preten&s;ions of a Right of Conque&s;t to the Di&s;trict of <HI>Minas,</HI> which might be grounded on the Capitulation at <HI>Grand Pr&eacute;,</HI> recommended it to Lieutenant Governor <HI>Ma&s;carene</HI> to &s;end there what Troops he could &s;pare out of the Garri&s;on, who were not re&s;trained by the late Capitulation from bearing Arms, to repo&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the Di&s;trict of <HI>Minas,</HI> and bring as many of the <HI>French</HI> Deputies as they could to <HI>Annapolis Royal</HI> to renew their Oaths of Fidelity to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Accordingly, &s;oon after, Mr. <HI>Ma&s;carene</HI> &s;ent out a Party of Rangers with orders to land at <HI>Grand Pr&ecirc;;</HI> pur&s;uant to which the commanding Officer landed there and &s;urprized &s;ome of the Inhabitans, who informed him that the <HI>Canadians</HI> apprehending that another De&s;cent might be made upon them from <HI>Annapolis</HI> by a fre&s;h Party of Troops, and not thinking them&s;elves &s;afe at <HI>Minas,</HI> had abandon'd it and marched back to <HI>Schieg|necto;</HI> which the Officer upon entering the Body of the

<P>Soon after this, Mr. <HI>De Ram&s;ay</HI> evacuated the Pro|vince of all his Troops, and returned with them to <HI>Ca|nada;</HI> and the Province, being thus cleared of the <HI>Canadians,</HI> remained quiet from any Attempts of the <HI>French,</HI> during the Remainder of the War.</P>
<P>In <HI>September</HI> 1747, the <HI>Governor of the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ets Bay</HI> received his Maje&s;ty's Orders, &s;ignifying his royal Approbation of the Preparations, he had made for the intended Expedition again&s;t <HI>Canada,</HI> and directing him in Conjunction with <HI>Admiral Knowles,</HI> then Go|vernor of Cape <HI>Breton,</HI> to disband the <HI>American</HI> Troops rais'd for that Service, retaining &s;uch a Number of them as they &s;hould judge nece&s;&s;ary for the Protection of <HI>Nova Scotia;</HI> to collect and liquidate the Accounts of the Ex|pence incurred by the &s;everal Governments on account of the Expedition, and tran&s;mit them to be laid before his Maje&s;ty.</P>

<PB N="75" REF="008258_0070_102E4F60A9D6C120">for the Province of <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> and to draw up &s;uch a Scheme for fortifying it, as he judg'd was requi|&s;ite for putting it into a State of Security; and to tran&s;|mit them to the Secretary of State's Office to be laid before his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Schiegnecto</HI> had ever &s;ince the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves above tho&s;e of the other two Di&s;tricts of <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> by a refracto|ry Behaviour towards his Maje&s;ty's Government; in which they were encouraged by their remote Di&s;tance from <HI>Annapolis Royal,</HI> and con&s;tant Intercour&s;e with the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada,</HI> and were now become ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected and dangerous to the Safety of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Governor</HI> therefore, in his Plan for fortifying the Province propo&s;ed that this Di&s;trict, which lay mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the &s;udden Attacks of the <HI>French,</HI> and the furthe&s;t from being &s;uccour'd in ca&s;e of an A&s;&s;ault, &s;hould be &s;ecured as &s;oon as might be, by a &s;trong Fortre&s;s upon the I&s;thmus, capable of holding a large Garri&s;on, to be built upon the Spot, where the <HI>French</HI> afterwards built <HI>Beau Sejour;</HI> and the whole I&s;thmus between the Ba&s;in of <HI>Schiegnecto</HI> and Bay <HI>Verte</HI> &s;ecured with a Line of Block-Hou&s;es placed at conve|nient Di&s;tances; and that the Inhabitants of the Di&s;|trict &s;hould be removed either to &s;ome Parts of the Pro|vince more under the In&s;pection and Check of his Ma|je&s;ty's Governor at <HI>Annapolis Royal;</HI> or into &s;ome o|ther of his Maje&s;ty's Colonies, where they &s;hould have equivalent Lands given them; and that Prote&s;tant Set|tlers, who&s;e Fidelity and Attachment to his Maje&s;ty's Government might be depended on, &s;hould be tran&s;|planted to <HI>Schiegnecto</HI> in their Room; which was not di&s;approv'd of.</P>
<P>It will be difficult to &s;trike the Line between the Ra|tification of the Treaty of <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> in which it was &s;tipulated, that the controverted Limits of this Pro|vince &s;hould be determined by Commi&s;&s;aries appointed on the Part of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI>'s &s;eizing &s;everal Parts of the Country which were in di&s;pute.</P>

No &s;ooner was the Treaty concluded, than they &s;ent a Party into St. <HI>John</HI>'s River to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and their Incroachments grew &s;o fa&s;t in every Part of the Penin&s;ula, that after the narrow E&s;capes and &s;ignal Deli|verances, it had during the War, if Providence had not again interpo&s;ed in its Favour, by rai&s;ing up a

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> <DATE>May 9, 1749.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Two Days ago I received from Mr. <HI>Ma&s;carene</HI> a Copy of your Letter to him, dated at <HI>Quebec</HI> the 15th of <HI>January;</HI> wherein (among other Demands) you call upon him to acquaint you, whether he intends to com|prehend the <HI>Abenaqui Indians</HI> in the Peace, without requiring any kind of Submi&s;&s;ion from them; and de|&s;ire that in &s;uch ca&s;e he would engage me to let them re&s;ettle in their Village, and their Mi&s;&s;ionaries remain there with them unmole&s;ted, as they did before the War; ob&s;erving to him that tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> entered into the War, only as your Allies, and therefore when the War
<PB N="77" REF="008258_0072_102E4F6601F7CCA8">was fini&s;hed with you, it ought to be &s;o with regard to them; and you proceed to &s;ay, Sir, that if they thought otherwi&s;e in <HI>New England,</HI> you &s;hall be obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> intimating that it is of Importance to the Safety and Tranquillity of the Frontiers of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay,</HI> that you &s;hould have a &s;peedy and po&s;itive An&s;wer, and that you &s;hall not be &s;urprized, if the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould proceed to Acts of Violence.</P>
<P>To this, Sir, which is the fourth Demand in your Letter, Mr. <HI>Ma&s;carene</HI> having referred you to me upon it, I &s;hall comply with your Reque&s;t in giving as &s;peedy and po&s;itive an An&s;wer as may be.</P>
<P>The River of St. <HI>John</HI>'s, upon which that Part of the <HI>Indians,</HI> to which you chiefly refer, is &s;eated, has been ever deemed to be &s;ituated within the Heart of <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> and con&s;equently that Tribe of <HI>Indians,</HI> together with the <HI>French</HI> Inhabitants upon the &s;ame River, are within his Maje&s;ty's Territories; and accordingly, Sir, the latter have acknowledged them&s;elves ever &s;ince the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> to be the Subjects of the Crown of <HI>Great Britain</HI> by tak|ing the Oaths of Fidelity and Allegiance to it; and have had the Protection of his Maje&s;ty's Government in common with his other Subjects in that Province: This being the ca&s;e, the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> when the Advice of a Rupture between his Maje&s;ty and the King your Ma&s;ter was hourly expected, under the Pretext of &s;ending a Deputation to Mr. <HI>Ma&s;carene,</HI> to de&s;ire they might remain in Peace and Amity with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> notwith&s;tanding War &s;hould happen between the two Crowns, gained Admi&s;&s;ion into <HI>Annapolis Royal</HI> for &s;ome of their Tribe, who were in reality (as it afterwards proved) Spies; and having obtained Mr. <HI>Ma&s;carene</HI>'s Agreement to what they pretended to propo&s;e in behalf of their Tribe, and being hon|ourably treated and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by him, returned in three Weeks after, among others of their Tribe with
<PB N="78" REF="008258_0073_102E4F6AA75609B0">the Mi&s;&s;ionary <HI>Dr Loutre</HI> at their Head, &s;urprized and killed as many of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Annapolis Roy|al,</HI> as they caught without the Fort, de&s;troyed their Cattle, burnt their Hou&s;es, and continued Acts of Ho&s;tility again&s;t the Garri&s;on, till the arrival of the fir&s;t Party of Succours which I &s;ent it from <HI>New|England;</HI> &s;uch was the Entrance of the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> Sir, into the War with us, and their <HI>Alliance</HI> with you.</P>
<P>For this perfidious Behaviour I cau&s;ed War to be declared in his Maje&s;ty's Name again&s;t them at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>November</HI> 1744, and, &s;o far as it depends upon me, they &s;hall not be admitted to Terms of Peace till they have made a proper Submi&s;&s;ion for their Treachery, unle&s;s they &s;hould be already compre|hended in the Definitive Treaty of Peace and Friend|&s;hip lately concluded at <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> which I &s;hall on my Part &s;trictly ob&s;erve in every Point.</P>
<P>As to what you have thought fit to declare, Sir, in your Letter concerning your Intentions to &s;upport the <HI>Indians</HI> in Acts of Ho&s;tility again&s;t us, unle&s;s we give them Peace upon the Terms there pre&s;cribed by you, and the Danger which the Frontiers of the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts Bay</HI> in particular may be in, unle&s;s you have a &s;peedy and po&s;itive An&s;wer upon this head; what I have to &s;ay in An&s;wer is, that I &s;hall be &s;orry for a new Rupture between us, and am very de&s;irous to have perfect Tranquillity re&s;tored to the Province under my Government; but if the latter is not to be the Ca&s;e, and you think fit to make your&s;elf a Party in an <HI>Indian</HI> War again&s;t us; I doubt not but his Ma|je&s;ty's Subjects upon this Continent will be able to make ju&s;t Repri&s;als upon <HI>Canada,</HI> when it &s;hall be his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure to have them do it.</P>
<P>I can't avoid expre&s;&s;ing great Surprize at the other Parts of your Letter, whereby you take upon you to
<PB N="79" REF="008258_0074_102E4F6C2B248A58">call Mr. <HI>Ma&s;carene</HI> to account for expelling the Mi&s;|&s;ionary from <HI>Minas,</HI> for being guilty of &s;uch trea&s;o|nable Practices within his Maje&s;ty's Government, as merited a much &s;everer Puni&s;hment than that of Ex|pul&s;ion from the Province.</P>
<P>The Right, you claim of &s;ending Mi&s;&s;ionaries from <HI>France</HI> to re&s;ide among his Maje&s;ty's Subjects of <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> as their Prie&s;ts, and in con&s;equence of that your forbidding his Maje&s;ty's Governor to make any Alte|ration in the State of Religion and its Mini&s;ters there is &s;till more extraordinary; and I mu&s;t not omit upon this Occa&s;ion to remark to you, that I think the Letter which the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Quebec</HI> lately wrote to Mr. <HI>Ma&s;ca|rene</HI> concerning his intended Vi&s;itation of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects in that Government, in &s;uch terms, as &s;hew'd, he looks upon them as part of his Cure of Souls, and within his Juri&s;diction, was likewi&s;e an extraordinary Attempt, and can't be admitted.</P>
<P>Your interfering in his Maje&s;ty's Puni&s;hment of his Subjects in <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> inflicted for rebellious and trea&s;onable Practices again&s;t his Crown, and his requir|ing others of them to renew their Oaths of Fidelity; and in one Word, your treating the Subjects of the Crown of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in that Province, as if you look'd upon them as Subjects of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, and being under his Allegiance, is, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more &s;urprizing; and as the&s;e Attempts are manife&s;t Inva&s;ions of the undoubted Right, which every Prince has over his Subjects, I can't but look upon them as In&s;ults upon his Maje&s;ty's Government, which require no further An&s;wer.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Attempts, Sir, upon his Maje&s;ty's Right of Government over his Subjects in <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> I am le&s;s &s;urprized at your Encroachments upon the Limits of his Province, which you are plea&s;ed to call in your Let|ter Dependencies of the Government of <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="008258_0075_102E4F6EBA5B02B8">
As to your Demand for the Relea&s;e of the two <HI>In|dians</HI> carry'd off by Captain <HI>Gorham,</HI> I can't allow, Sir, that you have a Right to interpo&s;e in that Affair, and Mr. <HI>Gorham</HI> has &s;atisfy'd me that he committed no Breach of public Faith in doing it.</P>
<P>I can't conclude without making u&s;e of this Op|portunity to acquaint you, that we look on Fort <HI>St. Frederick</HI> at <HI>Crown Point,</HI> as an Encroachment on his Maje&s;ty's Territories; and in ca&s;e you proceed to &s;ettle the Country round it, I &s;hall e&s;teem tho&s;e Set|tlements &s;o too, unle&s;s that Tract has been ceded to you by the late definitive Treaty at <HI>Aix la Chapelle.</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;orry, Sir, that the fir&s;t Fruits of the Peace on your Part have &s;o unpromi&s;ing an A&s;pect; and beg you will be per&s;uaded that nothing &s;hall be wanting in me to pre&s;erve the good under&s;tanding, which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between us in time of Peace, having the Honour to be with the mo&s;t perfect Regard,</P>
