<P>THE Per&s;on &s;poken of, is the renowned <HI>David</HI> the Son of <HI>Je&s;&s;e.</HI> A Per&s;on of an illu&s;trious Hou&s;e, of the Lyon-like Tribe of <HI>Judah;</HI> tho' the fir&s;t of his Family that came to the Throne.</P>
<P>HIS Ance&s;tor of the third a&s;cent was BOAZ; who is &s;aid to have been a mighty Man of wealth in <HI>Beth|lehem</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ruth II. 1&mdash;4.</NOTE>. And the &s;econd above <HI>Him</HI> was NAHSHON; who is &s;aid to be the head of the Hou&s;e of his Fa|ther, yea a renowned Per&s;on of the Congregation, a Prince of the Tribe of his Father, and one of the Heads of the Thou&s;ands in I&s;rael, <HI>Numb.</HI> I. 4, 7, 16. And in the following Chapter, we find him at the Di|vine
<PB N="3" REF="002949_0006_0FE6A0E974E52340">Appointment pitching by his own Standard, with the En&s;ign of his Father's Hou&s;e, on the Ea&s;tern &s;ide of the <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> as Captain of the Children of <HI>Judah,</HI> and Head of his Ho&s;t of above 70 Thou&s;and Men: to defend that Sacred and Divine Pavilion, as it march|ed thro' the Wilderne&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb.

And on the &s;ame day that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had fully &s;et up the Tabernacle, this great Captain was the very fir&s;t of the twelve Princes of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Heads of the Hou&s;e of their Fathers, who were the Princes of the Tribes, and were over them that were numbered; who brought their rich and liberal Offerings before the Altar: and he made his Offering the fir&s;t day as the Prince of the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Numb. VII. 1, 2, 10,&mdash; 17. &amp; 1 Chron. II. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS was <HI>David</HI> the Son of <HI>Je&s;&s;e's</HI> nearer and illu&s;trious Pedigree. He was one of the mo&s;t Princely Families in <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> not to mention <HI>Three</HI> of his War|like Brethren, whom we find as Voluntiers in King <HI>Saul's</HI> Armies, Fighting again&s;t the <HI>Phili&s;tian</HI> Enemies, tho&s;e implacable haters of their Nation and pure Religion.</P>
<P>As for his own <HI>Per&s;onal</HI> Indowments&mdash;He was of a beautiful and ruddy Countenance and goodly to look to: a comely Per&s;on, prudent in matters, a Man of War, a mighty valiant Man, and the <HI>Lord</HI> was with him <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. XVI. 12, 18. &amp; Ch. XVII. 42.</NOTE>. This is the Character we have of <HI>David,</HI> even when he was a Youth, while he dwelt at his Father's Hou&s;e, and before he came into any pro&s;pect of the Crown of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> He was every way accompli&s;hed to defend and rule &s;o great a People, and to make them happy.</P>
<P>BUT how came the Son of <HI>Je&s;&s;e</HI> to a&s;cend the Throne of <HI>I&s;rael?</HI></P>
<P>FOR he was neither the elde&s;t Branch of <HI>Jacob,</HI> nor of <HI>Judah,</HI> nor of his Grand&s;on <HI>Hezron,</HI> nor yet of his
<PB N="4" REF="002949_0007_0FE6A114996FEAC8">own, Father <HI>Je&s;&s;e;</HI> and there were great numbers of <HI>prior</HI> Lines by Birth Surviving: So that if the <HI>Senior</HI> Branch were to be indefea&s;ably prefer'd, he could never have had a Right or Hope of a&s;cending to &s;o much as the Principality of his own &s;ingle <HI>Tribe:</HI> And yet the Text ob&s;erves that he came to Reign over <HI>all I&s;rael</HI></P>
<P>REUBEN was the fir&s;t born of <HI>Jacob:</HI> And &s;o the Birthright was by Nature his, &amp; would have de&s;cended &s;o to his elde&s;t offspring. But for his &s;ignal wicked|ne&s;s, he both forfeited the Priviledge for Him&s;elf and the Intail for his Po&s;terity. His Father <HI>Jacob</HI> therefore by Divine direction ju&s;tly cut him off: Declaring that tho' <HI>Reuben</HI> was his fir&s;t born, his might and the be|ginning of his &s;trength, the excellence of Dignity and the excellence of Power; yet for his great unworthy|ne&s;s, he &s;hould be as un&s;table as water, he &s;hould not excell: And then the <HI>Patriarch</HI> gave away the Birth|right of Inheritance to <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> &amp; the Power to <HI>Judah,</HI> his younger Children <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Gen. XLIX.</NOTE>. Agreeable to this, the Writer of this Book ob&s;erves, in the 5th Chap. at the begin|ning; That tho' REUBEN <HI>was the fir&s;t born, yet his Birthright was given to the &s;ons of</HI> JOSEPH, <HI>the &s;on of</HI> ISRAEL: <HI>And the Genealogy is not to be reckoned after the Birthright: For</HI> JUDAH <HI>prevailed above his Brethren, and of him came the chief Ruler, but the Birthright was</HI> JOSEPHS.</P>
<P>THIS no doubt was a &s;pecial work of GOD: with whom it is as equal to rai&s;e tho&s;e Children he brings forth later into the World, to an higher Power and Dignity, as to bring forth others into the World before them. But who is there that does not admire the Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice, Holine&s;s &amp; Goodne&s;s of his Conduct in this matter? And is not this <HI>Divine Example</HI> written for our Admonition al&s;o, on whom the ends of the World are come? And wherefore &s;hould it be re|corded, but to teach us; That in Imitation of the like Perfections, Parents, and much more Kings &amp; King|doms
<PB N="5" REF="002949_0008_0FE6A0E9ACFB1B30">for a greater and more nece&s;&s;ary Good, may &s;et a&s;ide tho&s;e elder Branches that have rendered them|&s;elves utterly unworthy to excell, and be&s;tow the In|heritance &amp; Rule on younger? That &s;o the <HI>Senior</HI> Branches, e&s;pecially of more Publick Families, may be more careful of their Principles &amp; Conduct, and may not forfeit their Succe&s;&s;ion: And in ca&s;e they &s;hould&mdash; that the <HI>Junior</HI> Ones may by the &s;ame means &s;ecure their own Rever&s;ion to the forfeited Inheritance.</P>
<P>BUT to return &mdash;</P>
<P>As the mo&s;t wi&s;e and righteous GOD was pleas'd to choo&s;e the younger Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> for the Principal Seat of Power in <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> &s;o he likewi&s;e cho&s;e his Ser|vant <HI>David</HI> a younger Branch of the Princely line to be Ruler of his People <HI>I&s;rael</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Sam VII. 8 P&s;al. LXXVIII 68, &mdash; 71.</NOTE>. Agreably to this he afterwards declar'd in a Great A&s;&s;embly of all the Princes of the Tribes, with the Captains, Officers and mighty Men of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> 1 Chron. XXVIII. 4. <HI>Howbeit, the Lord God of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>cho&s;e me before all the Hou&s;e of my Father, to be King over</HI> I&s;rael <HI>for ever: for he hath cho&s;en</HI> Judah <HI>to be the Ruler; and of the Hou&s;e of</HI> Judah, <HI>the Hou&s;e of my Father; and among the Sons of my Father, He liked me to make me King over all</HI> I&s;rael.</P>
<P>GOD had indeed, before, in&s;tated <HI>Saul</HI> of ano|ther Family in this Royal Dignity. But upon his great Folly, Ra&s;hne&s;s, Prevarication and Rebellion again&s;t the LORD, who had &s;o highly exalted him; it is &s;aid, The LORD repented that He had &s;et him up to be <HI>King</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. XV. 11, 35.</NOTE>: And becau&s;e that <HI>Saul</HI> had rejected the word of the LORD, therefore the LORD had rejected <HI>him</HI> from Reigning over <HI>I&s;rael</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 23, 26 and Chap. XVI. 1.</NOTE>. Yea the Prophet <HI>Samuel</HI> plainly tells him, 1 Sam. XV. 28. <HI>The Lord hath rent the Kingdom of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>from thee this Day, and hath given it to a Neighbour of thine that is better than Thou.</HI> And tho' King <HI>Saul</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="002949_0009_0FE6A1215EFBB788">had left behind him both a legitimate Female and Male Po&s;terity; yet they were entirely excluded with Him, and their entail to the Crown cut off for ever. The poor rejected <HI>King</HI> &s;eems indeed at length convinced of his Sin and Fooli&s;hne&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam XV. 24 &mdash; 30.</NOTE>: But his Repentance was alas too late to pre&s;erve the Kingdom and it's Suc|ce&s;&s;ion to his Royal Family: For the Prophet tells him; that <HI>the Strength of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>would not lie, nor Repent: i e.</HI> The Great GOD wou'd not alter his declared Re&s;olution in this matter.</P>
<P>BUT this <HI>better Neighbour</HI> was the excellent young DAVID the Son of <HI>Je&s;&s;e.</HI> For now the Divine De|cree breaks forth concerning Him: And <HI>Samuel</HI> is quickly &s;ent, even while <HI>Saul</HI> was yet alive, to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Je&s;&s;e,</HI> to anoint his Son and &s;ignify his cer|tain de&s;ignation to the Kingly Dignity.</P>
<P>BUT his A&s;cent to this was Gradual, and thro' a great variety of &s;urprizing Turns and &s;trenuous Op|po&s;itions.</P>
<P>HE was quickly called forth by Providence, into Publick Service. And then he gave a fair &amp; charming <HI>Specimen</HI> of the Glory &amp; Felicity of his future Go|vernment.</P>
<P>HE began with a mo&s;t Heroick Act of Zeal and Courage in the Cau&s;e of GOD &amp; <HI>I&s;rael</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. XVII.</NOTE>. And whither|&s;oever he went he behaved him&s;elf wi&s;ely and pro&s;pe|red. Being &s;et over the Men of War, he was ac|cepted in the &s;ight of all the People, and even al&s;o in the &s;ight of <HI>Sauls</HI> Servants, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> XVIII. 5. At the 13th Ver&s;e, we read, that being made a Cap|tain over an Army, He went out and came in before the People, He behaved him&s;el wifely in all his ways, and the LORD was with him. And at the 30 <HI>v.</HI> That he behaved him&s;elf more wifely than all the. Servants of <HI>Saul;</HI> &s;o that his Name was much &s;et by.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002949_0010_0FE6A0EF46B54CE8">
SAUL indeed for this grew very jealous &amp; fearful of him; and became his inveterate and perpetual Ene|my <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam.

He &s;tiles them, <HI>The Floods of ungodly Men;</HI> or the Floods of <HI>Belial,</HI> as the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and the <HI>Margin</HI> have it. <HI>But all I&s;rael and Judah loved</HI> DAVID <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. XVIII. 16</NOTE>. The Generality of the Nation loved him, and had their Eyes upon him, even when they dare hardly &s;how it thro' the Violence and Rancour of his reigning Enemies. And what is u&s;ual in &s;uch a ca&s;e, their Enmity and Fear excited them to &s;uch a Train of violent Proceedings, as extreamly weakned their own E&s;teem and Intere&s;t, increa&s;ed his, and even helpt to pave the way for that Succe&s;&s;ion, which they did their utmo&s;t to prevent for ever.</P>
<P>IN the mean while, his Conduct was &s;o exact and perfect, that even <HI>Saul</HI> him&s;elf acknowledg'd that DAVID was more Righteous than he <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Chap XXIV. 17.</NOTE>. <HI>Abigail</HI> de|clares that evil had not been found in him all his days <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. XXV. 28.</NOTE> And even <HI>Achi&s;h</HI> the King of <HI>Gath</HI> was &s;o charmed with him; as he &s;olemnly prote&s;ted, that DAVID had been upright in his eyes, that he had found no evil in him, but that he was good in his &s;ight even as an <HI>Angel</HI> of GOD <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap XXIX. 3 &mdash; 9.</NOTE>. Yea &s;o great a Love had many, even of the very <HI>Tribe</HI> of <HI>Saul</HI> for him; that in the mo&s;t dangerous conjuncture which threatned his Per|&s;on &amp; Succe&s;&s;ion, they ventur'd to go over to him; prote&s;ting as in 1 Chron. XII. 18. <HI>Thine are we</HI> DA|VID, <HI>and on thy &s;ide thou Son of Je&s;&s;e: Peace, Peace be to Thee: and Peace be to thy Helpers; for thy God helpeth thee.</HI></P>
<P>Now all this was during the Life of <HI>Saul.</HI> And then afterwards&mdash;for many Years before his Acce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="8" REF="002949_0011_0FE6480BCCA90720">to the Throne of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and in the Reign of <HI>Saul's Succe&s;&s;or,</HI> he gave a bright Example of an happy Go|vernment, while he ruled over his own <HI>Tribe</HI> of <HI>Judah</HI> only.

IT would be beyond the <HI>Scope</HI> of our <HI>Text</HI> to ex|tend our views very far into SOLOMON'S Reign.

<P>THE excellent Ble&s;&s;ing &amp; Charge of <HI>his Father</HI> is in the&s;e remarkable words, 2 Chron.

Then &s;halt thou pro&s;per, if thou take&s;t heed to fulfil the &s;tatutes and judgments, which the Lord charged Mo&s;es with, concerning I&s;rael: Be &s;trong and of good courage, dread not, nor be di&s;mayed.</HI></P>
<P>AND the Hi&s;tory of his pious Petition is in the Chapter immediately &s;ucceeding our Text, from the 7th to the 12th ver&s;e&mdash; <HI>In that night did God appear to</HI> SOLOMON, <HI>and &s;aid unto him, ask what I &s;hall give thee.

Now, O Lord God, let thy promi&s;e to</HI> DAVID <HI>my Father be e&s;tabli&s;hed: for thou ha&s;t made me King over a People, like the du&s;t of the earth in multitude. Give me now Wi&s;dom and Knowledge, that I may go out and come in be|fore this People: for who can judge this thy People that is &s;o great? And God &s;aid to</HI> SOLOMON, <HI>Be|cau&s;e this was in thine heart and thou ha&s;t not asked riches, wealth or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet ha&s;t asked long life; but ha&s;t asked Wi&s;dom and Knowledge for thy &s;elf, that thou may&s;t judge my People, over whom I have made thee King: Wi&s;|dom and Knowledge is granted to thee, and I will give thee Riches and Wealth, and Honour, &s;uch as

<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Character and Reign of our late Ble&s;&s;ed Sovereign</HI> KING GEORGE <HI>the</HI> I.</P>
<P>WE all doubtle&s;s know, that he was the Son of Nobles. He by Both his Parents de&s;cended of a Race of Ancient Princes, both in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Britain.</HI> His immediate Father was one of the mo&s;t Powerful Princes of the Empire: And his immediate Mother, was in the latter part of her Life, the neare&s;t of any Prote&s;tant Royal Blood, to the Crown of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>HE was of a comely, florid Countenance, like DAVID. Of great Wi&s;dom, Courage, Re&s;olution, Steadine&s;s, Integrity and Clemency. Well vers'd in the Art of War; but naturally of Peaceful inclinations: which mixture of Qualities, is agreed, as one ob&s;erves, by the Experience of all Ages, to make the be&s;t and mo&s;t glorious Princes. So remarkable for a &s;trict Re|gard to Ju&s;tice; that agreable to his own Judgment
<PB N="18" REF="002949_0021_0FE6A12EC3B93B58">and Di&s;po&s;ition, his MOTTO was &mdash; That <HI>The Glory of a Prince con&s;i&s;ts in doing Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>A Per&s;on that appeared always to have a mighty Sen&s;e of the <HI>Publick Intere&s;t;</HI> and of the great Duty incumbent on him, in his High Station, to promote the Welfare of the World. His Eyes were always fix'd on the Affairs of his own Dominions, and of the Na|tions round about him. &mdash; Clo&s;e and Indefatigable in his Application to Publick Bu&s;ine&s;s &mdash; Steady to his Friends and Allies &mdash; Re&s;olute to maintain the Faith of Treaties &mdash; Frugal of the Publick Monies &mdash; Temp|erate and Sober &mdash; and in all his Oeconomy exactly Regular.</P>
<P>FOR <HI>Religion</HI> &mdash; a thorow Prote&s;tant &mdash; Full of Chri&s;tian Charity &amp; Genoro&s;ity &mdash; An utter Enemy Chri&s;tian Charity &amp; Genoro&s;ity &mdash; An utter Enemy to Slavery and Per&s;ecution &mdash; Zealous for the true Religion, and the Cau&s;e of Civil &amp; Religious Liberty. In this Noble Cau&s;e he oft expos'd his Per&s;on, at the Head of Armies, and in his Earlier Days, in diver&s;e Parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE he ruled in his own <HI>Electorate;</HI> He &s;how'd the Excellence of his Political Spirit, Principles and Conduct; in the Shining Prudence, Equity &amp; Mild|ne&s;s of his Admini&s;tration: That he was tho't to be the mo&s;t beloved by his Subjects, of any Prince in the whole World. He looked on their Wealth &amp; Hap|pine&s;s, as the Source and Ba&s;is of his own. There were no Divi&s;ions or Factions among them, by rea&s;on of his Impartial De&s;tinction of Merit: And in&s;tead of Murmuring again&s;t him, they would be always telling In&s;tances of his exemplary Ju&s;tice and Moderation.</P>
<P>HE was even then accounted without a Rival, the Wi&s;e&s;t Prince of <HI>Germany.</HI> And &s;eemed to be the Per&s;on ordain'd &amp; prepar'd by Heaven, for the rai&s;ing <HI>Great Britain</HI> to that high Rank &amp; Dignity, which it &s;hou'd always have in the World: Which is to be the Tutelar Head of the Reformed Intere&s;t every where, and to hold the Ballance of Power in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

IN Short, HE was every way accompli&s;hed for the Government of this Great &amp; Mighty Kingdom. And both before, and after the Decea&s;e e&s;pecially, of his mo&s;t Excellent MOTHER; To HIM were the Eyes of the better part of the Nation turned, for the Security of their Precious Liberties &amp; pure Religion; And in the&s;e of all that is dear to them both as Men &amp; Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>THRO' a great variety of Revolutions, the Crown came to be, in a mo&s;t Firm and Solemn manner, in|tailed on him, and on his Prote&s;tant Po&s;terity for ever. And thro' many Violent and Mighty Oppo&s;itions, He came at la&s;t, by a Surprizing Turn of Providence, to take the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>IN that <HI>Gloomy part of the preceeding Reign;</HI> when the Foundations of the Earth &s;eemed to be out of Cour&s;e, and the Enemies of his Succe&s;&s;ion to prevail &amp; triumph over all Oppo&s;ition: We were ready then to &s;ay with the <HI>Mournful Prophet</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lam.

<P>HE began with an open <HI>Declaration</HI> of his Re&s;o|lution to maintain our Religion, Properties, Laws and Liberties: And as He was never known to deceive; He has all along made Good his Royal Word.</P>
<P>BY indu&s;trious Applications and wi&s;e Treaties, He &s;oon retrieved the Nation's <HI>Commerce,</HI> which is it's very Strength and Soul; and that had been mi&s;erably given away by Articles, at the Clo&s;e of the fore-go|ing Reign.

FIRM and re&s;olute to a&s;&s;ert the Rights &amp; Honours of the Kingdom; He was neither ambitious of lar|ger Empire Abroad, nor of greater Power at Home.

And yet never had a <HI>Briti&s;h King</HI> a greater Power among his Subjects. As an Argument of their highe&s;t Value for Him, and their mo&s;t perfect Confidence in his Equity &amp; Goodne&s;s; they de&s;ired and enacted that, for a certain Time, when the Pub|lick Safety requir'd it, He &s;hou'd have a greater Pow|er over them than any of the <HI>Kings</HI> before him. His Reign is an illu&s;trious In&s;tance; That the mo&s;t Indulgent Princes are the mo&s;t Powerful; while the Ambitious rai&s;e their People's Jealou&s;ies, de&s;troy their Confidence, and grow weak &amp; impotent.</P>
<P>HE mo&s;t wi&s;ely improv'd the <HI>Naval Power</HI> of the Kingdom: and has carried it to an higher Pitch of Glory than the Seas have ever &s;een. By this has He &s;pread a Terror thro' the World: with a &s;ingle Blow prevented bloody &amp; expen&s;ive Wars, and put a Period to them in the very Moment, and by the very Action that began them. Hereby has He encouraged, pro|tected and &s;trengthned his Allies; di&s;appointed the De|&s;igns of invading Enemies; broken pernicious Leagues; held the Ballance among the Nations; and pre&s;erved them in Order &amp; Tranquillity.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, HE was in &s;ome re&s;pects a Father to the Kings of the Earth; or at lea&s;t a powerful &amp; deci&s;ive Moderator and Umpire among them. The Eyes of the greate&s;t Princes were turned to Him: To Him
<PB N="22" REF="002949_0025_0FE6A13679F96E40">they gave Ear, and waited: they kept &s;ilence at his Councils: And their publick Re&s;olutions were &s;u&s;|pended upon his Determinations.</P>
<P><HI>AND as for us in the&s;e far di&s;tant Ends of his Dominions</HI>&mdash;We have in a great mea&s;ure felt the In|fluence of his happy Reign.</P>
<P>THRO' his &s;afe Protection we &s;till enjoy tho&s;e pre|cious <HI>Charter-Privileges,</HI> which our Fore-Fathers left their Native plea&s;ant Land, and came over hither into a mi&s;erable Thicket to procure; which were So|lemnly confirmed to us by the Glorious KING WILLIAM and QUEEN MARY of Eternal Me|mory <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. CXII. 6.</NOTE>; and are comprehen&s;ive of every thing on Earth that is Dear and Valuable to us.</P>
<P>WHEN we contended in the dark, even about what was tho't his own Prerogative &mdash; while he knew we did it out of no Di&s;affection to Him, but from a Dif|ference of Judgment only; He like a Tender Father gently overlooked our Infirmities: He confirm'd our Liberties, and di&s;appointed the earne&s;t Expectations of our envious Enemies. And tho' they daily mi&s;repre|&s;ent our Actions, and exaggerate every petty Fault among us; they could never make any Impre&s;&s;ions on Him to our Di&s;advantage. He had been well inform'd that there is not a &s;ingle Per&s;on of our Denomination Here, who did not earne&s;tly de&s;ire His Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne and the Continuance of it in his Serene Hou&s;e for ever.</P>
<P>THUS Liv'd &amp; Reign'd this Greate&s;t &amp; mo&s;t Ad|mired of Princes in his Day: The Darling &amp; Protection of his People: The great Support of the Reformed Intere&s;t: And the Arbiter of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>AND thus does it become a grateful People, at the Sorrowful Conclu&s;ion of the Reign of &s;o Great and
<PB N="23" REF="002949_0026_0FE6A1074E737A68">Good a KING, to reflect upon the &s;ignal Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s, and Happy Influence of his Royal Care and Government: That they may mention. Him with de|&s;erved Honour and pre&s;erve a dear &amp; precious Memory of his Happy Reign. But in all the&s;e Great Vircues and Actions, we mu&s;t behold that SUPERIOUR BE|ING, by whom Kings Reign &amp; Princes decree Ju&s;tice; and a&s;cribe to HIM the Prai&s;e &amp; Honour of all the Ex|cellence that appeared in our late incomparable So|vereign, and of all the Great and Happy things that were performed by him for his People.</P>
<P>AND we mu&s;t now come to con&s;ider</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>HIS Decea&s;e, and the Circum&s;tances of it.</HI></P>
<P>THO' Kings are as <HI>Gods</HI> on Earth; yet even the Greate&s;t &amp; Be&s;t mu&s;t Die like <HI>Men,</HI> and fall to the Du&s;t as Humane Princes. And how hath the LORD covered the Daughter of our <HI>Zion</HI> with a Cloud in his Anger! How has he ca&s;t down from Heaven to the Earth the Beauty of <HI>I&s;rael!</HI> He has made our Strength to f! In the mid&s;t of all his pro&s;perous De&s;igns and Labours for the Publick Peace &amp; Wellfare; His Breath goes forth at once: He returneth to his Earth: In that very Day his Tho'ts peri&s;h.</P>
<P>AND yet he Died, like <HI>King</HI> DAVID, <HI>In a Good old Age,</HI> but <HI>Two</HI> Years &s;hort of His; and both <HI>full of Days, Riches and Honour.</HI> He died in the Hight of Wi&s;dom, Strength and U&s;efulne&s;s. What a wonder|fully Flouri&s;hing &amp; Wealthy Kingdom has he left be|hind him? And their unmea&s;urable Riches were as de|voted to him as if they were all his own. In fine, How full of Honour? &mdash; How fre&s;h was his Glory in him? In the Perfection of his Reign, and in the full Re&s;pect and Honours of his People, and of all the Nations round about; He goes off the Stage of Life before he fades, and leaves them to bewail his Lo&s;s with an an|&s;werable Fullne&s;s of Regret &amp; Sorrow.</P>

IT becomes us to Lament his Leaving us &mdash; who was our Be&s;t &amp; Greate&s;t Friend on Earth: And e&s;peci|ally at &s;uch a Time as this; when he was the Soul and Center of that Great <HI>Alliance,</HI> which pre&s;erves the Na|tions from Confu&s;ion; and was ju&s;t a Settling their uni|ver&s;al Tranquillity.
