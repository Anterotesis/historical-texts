<HEAD>To his Excellency <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Lovelace,</HI> Barron of <HI>Hurly.</HI> Captain General and Governour in Chief of the Provinces of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey, New-York,</HI> and Territories depending thereon in<HI>America, and</HI> Vice Admiral of the &s;ame. THE ANSWER OF <HI>Peter Sonmans,</HI> To an Addre&s;s pre&s;ented to your Excellency, by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, dated <HI>March</HI> 18. 1708.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it Plea&s;e your Excellency.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEfore I proceed to &s;ay any thing, in An&s;wer to the &s;aid Addre&s;s, I mu&s;t humbly beg leave to return my hearty thanks, for the right your Excellency does in permitting me to ju&s;tify my &s;elf from the many fal&s;e Accu&s;ations contained therein; which I chearfully undertake, in con&s;ideration of my own Innocence, and your Excellencys ju&s;tice in &s;hewing &s;o great a readine&s;s to hear both partys, which tho' mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary for the di&s;covery of the truth, the Mannagers &amp; Contrivers of that Addre&s;s, did not intend &s;hould be allowed me, as plainly appears by the Prayer thereof.</P>
<P>This, <HI>My Lord,</HI> mu&s;t &s;eem a very extraordinary Proceeding, that an A&s;&s;embly, which ought to take all imaginable care of pre&s;erving the Liberties and Properties of her Maje&s;tys Subjects, and Supporting the Courts of Judicature, &s;hould be induc'd to declare me guilty of <HI>Illegally u&s;ing the power I am cloathed with, to the great hurt of &s;everal of her Maje&s;ties Subjects, and if tolerated, will be of evil Example, and render their Liberties and Properties precarious; and at the di&s;po&s;al of every Magi&s;trate who will make his Will, and not the Law, the rule of his Actions,</HI> while they them&s;elves tran&s;gre&s;s the fundamental Rules of Ju&s;tice, and of Liberty and Property, in condemning me unheard, and praying your Lord&s;hip to do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>How ill grounded and untrue their charge is, your Excellency will ea&s;ily di&s;cover, and whether the Promoters of this Addre&s;s unwarrantably u&s;e the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them to the <HI>evil example</HI> of the Province, whether they <HI>render the Liberties and Properties of the Subjects precarious,</HI> when they condemn without Proof, when they &s;et them&s;elves up as a Supream Court to hear and determine all &s;uch things as the Law in its ordinary
<PB N="2" REF="001431_0002_0FB2F33D4629E568">cour&s;e hath provided for, and take Cognizance of &s;everal matters that are already before &s;ome of the Courts, and mu&s;t there be tryed, tho' they have not &s;o much as the Power of admini&s;tring an Oath to any one they examine? Or I, that have, to the utmo&s;t of my ability, endeavoured to keep up the Authoriy of the Courts, and never judged, much le&s;s con|demned any before Examination and a full hearing, thereby endeavouring <HI>to pre&s;erve the Liberties and Properties of her Majestys Subjects from being precarious,</HI> and have always &s;et Ju&s;tice, and the Laws, (as far as I knew them, being no Lawyer) before me as a Rule to govern my actions, and not my Will, as is a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>The Addre&s;s tells your Excellency, That <HI>having examined into the truth of &s;everal Complaints made again&s;t me, do find &amp;c.</HI> thereby intimating that <HI>&s;everal Complaints</HI> have been made: when by their own Votes and Report, not any Complaint, and but one Petition from per&s;ons &s;ummon'd to &s;erve upon a grand Inque&s;t for the Counties of <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Summer&s;et,</HI> at a Court of Se&s;&s;ions held at <HI>Amboy</HI> the 8th of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, appears to have been pre&s;ented to them; by the prayer of which Petition, the Petitioners only de&s;ired the &s;aid Counties in General, and them&s;elves in particular, <HI>might be relieved from &s;ome pretended unpre&s;idented Proceedings, and unjust Fines,</HI> (as the &s;aid Petition did &s;tile them) <HI>impo&s;ed upon them by that Court,</HI> which Fact, if they had been as true, as indeed they are not, only related to what happened at that Court, without &s;o much as mentioning any other Complaint. This Petition being referred to a Committee, that Committee, as I am advi&s;ed, could, nor ought not to have cognizance of any other matter, or thing, than what was referred to them, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the &s;ubject matter thereof: But the Committee taking upon them&s;elves to go beyond the &s;ubject Matter and Prayer of that Petition, into affairs of quite another nature, which were neither referred nor mentioned to them, is wholly unpre&s;idented and unwarrantable.</P>
<P>But to demon&s;trate the unaccountable Proceedings of the Committee, per|fectly to your Lord&s;hip; your Excellency will plea&s;e to remark, That Mr. <HI>Willocks,</HI> the chief of the &s;aid Petitioners, becau&s;e I de&s;ired him to take the Oaths appointed by &s;everal Acts of Parlaiment, in the room of the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> before I would admit him to &s;erve on the &s;aid Grand Inque&s;t, which he refu&s;ed, was permitted to arrogate to him&s;elf the liberty of being chief Mannager and Examiner at the &s;aid Committee.</P>
<P>The Addre&s;s further intimates to your Excellency, <HI>That they are &s;orry, that I, who have the honour of being of the Queens Council, and do not want &s;ufficient Abilities for her Service, &s;hould by my imprudent Conduct, lay them under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;o publick a Complaint again&s;t me.</HI> I am as little obliged to the promoters of the Addre&s;s for that honour, as for their Complement, becau&s;e the fir&s;t was by &s;ome of their Members, or their Friends, oppo&s;ed as much and as long as it could, and the la&s;t only u&s;ed to aggravate the Crimes they would charge me with. The nece&s;&s;ity they lay under of &s;o publick a complaint, an impartial Judge will find difficulty to di&s;cern, be|cau&s;e &s;uppo&s;ing all they &s;ay true, (the contrary of which I have no doubt the whole Province believes) they are things of that nature that the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Courts ought, and only can Judge of them, where accu&s;ed, as well as the Accu&s;er mu&s;t be legally heard, and the Evidences on both &s;ides duly weigh'd
<PB N="3" REF="001431_0003_0FB2F33EADA3B358">and con&s;idered, &s;o that <HI>imprudent Conduct,</HI> not to give it a wor&s;e term, may more truly be turned upon the Mannagers of the &s;aid Addre&s;s than me.</P>
<P>They would per&s;wade your Excellency in the next place: <HI>That they cannot be &s;o much wanting to the Country they repre&s;ent, as to be &s;ilent in a Cau&s;e that &s;o ju&s;tly requires their Con&s;ideration.</HI> The &s;aid Addre&s;&s;ors, <HI>My Lord,</HI> might have cleared this point, with mentioning but one Com|plaint, or other in&s;tance made to them by the Country, the neglect of which could give the lea&s;t ground for &s;uppo&s;ition that they are <HI>wanting to the Country they repre&s;ent,</HI> or required their con&s;ideration, &s;o particularly, that without it no remedy could be had. But not one complaint being made again&s;t me, &s;ave that one Petition, before mentioned, the Country and I have more rea&s;on to be heartily &s;orry, that &s;ome Members among the Repre&s;entatives have &s;o far indulged their own private Re&s;entments, and betrayed the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, to engage a whole A&s;&s;embly in revenging a particular Picque, the more &s;ince my lawful Endeavours to recover tho&s;e ju&s;t Rights and Dues, which they have torn from me, only occa&s;ion that Picque; &s;uch Proceedings, I am fully convinced, your Excellency will never countenance, but on the contrary, that your Lord&s;hip will di&s;|courage by &s;uch proper methods as are con&s;onant to your Lord&s;hips great Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice, all tho&s;e, who, under colour of pre&s;erving the Queens Honour, and performing their Duty to their Country, endeavour to u&s;e the Power allowed them, only to make both a Party to and a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the Injurys they have done.</P>
<P>Being &s;en&s;ible that my An&s;wer to the Addre&s;s will oblige me to tre&s;pa&s;s too much upon your Lord&s;hips time, I will pa&s;s over many ju&s;t Remarks, which might be made upon it, &amp; confine my &s;elf, as much as is po&s;&s;ible, to what is immediately conducing to my ju&s;tification. Wherefore, I only deny, and &s;o pa&s;s over the groundle&s;s Accu&s;ation, that tho&s;e <HI>Arbitrary mea&s;ures</HI> (as the &s;aid Addre&s;s is plea&s;ed to &s;tile them) <HI>with which the late Admini&s;tra|tion under the Lord</HI> Cornbury <HI>&s;o much abounded, were very much owing to my Coun&s;el, I being one of the per&s;ons on who&s;e advice his Lord&s;hip very much relyed;</HI> becau&s;e the &s;aid Addre&s;s it &s;elf, &s;tiles it only Belief and Conjecture. What Arbitrary mea&s;ures my Lord <HI>Cornbury</HI> u&s;ed, are to me utterly un|known, and if any &s;uch were, how little they can affect me, I leave to your Excellencys con&s;ideration, &s;ince I had not, until la&s;t <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the honour of &s;itting in her Maje&s;tys Council, nor indeed much of his Lord&s;hips, Con|ver&s;ation, be&s;ides, wholly incapable of advi&s;ing a Nobleman of his many extrordinary Qualifications and great Sagacity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing the Addre&s;s particularly accu&s;es me with, is, <HI>That procur|ed the arre&s;ting of Mr.</HI> John Barclay <HI>on</HI> Whit&s;unday <HI>la&s;t, coming out of Church from the Sacrament,</HI> which &s;aid Addre&s;s affirms, <HI>is a manife&s;t breach of the Peace, and contrary to the Laws in that ca&s;e made and provided.</HI> Here the Mannagers of the Addre&s;s prevailed upon the Repre&s;entatives to a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves an ab&s;olute uncontroulable Power of determining what is a <HI>breach of the Law.</HI> But allowing that it was a <HI>breach of the Peace,</HI> it is not a Crime of &s;o high a nature, but any inferiour Court, nay, a &s;ingle Ju&s;tice of the Peace by a law of this Province, might examine into, and puni&s;h it, without troubling your Lord&s;hip, which is evident not only from every days practi&s;e, but even from the Proceedings which have &s;ucceeded that &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="001431_0004_0FB2F34178E85FE8">Crime, &s;ome of the &s;aid Committee having already per&s;waded the &s;aid <HI>Barclay</HI> to arre&s;t Dr. <HI>Arents</HI> (who took him) for his alledged mi&s;take, and found an Indictment again&s;t him, for his pre&s;umed breach of the Law. But I have no doubt of &s;eeing that Fact ju&s;tified, becau&s;e I am &s;ure its common in <HI>England,</HI> where I never heard &s;uch a ca&s;e que&s;tioned; which is thus:)</P>
<P>The &s;aid <HI>Barclay</HI> refu&s;ing to an&s;wer a Bill filed in Chancery again&s;t him, after the time he had prayed, and was allowed him, elap&s;ed, &s;tood all the Contempts of the &s;aid Court for above a year, mo&s;tly &s;heltering him&s;elf your Exellencys Goverment of <HI>New-York,</HI> at length a Commi&s;&s;ion of Rebellion was &s;ealed again&s;t him, directed among others, to the &s;aid Dr. <HI>Arents,</HI> which I delivered to him on the <HI>Saturday.</HI> He asked me, if he might execute it on the <HI>Sunday,</HI> if he &s;hould chance to &s;ee him? I told him, he might, being no common Proce&s;s, but a Commi&s;&s;ion under the broad Seal of the Province to an&s;wer the Queen as a Rebel; accordingly <HI>Arents</HI> took him, after he was come out of the Church. If I erred in my Opinion in a point of Law, which is the utmo&s;t can be made of this Article, being no Lawyer, I cannot &s;uppo&s;e your Excellency will take that to be &s;o great a crime, as to de&s;erve <HI>&s;uch publick Cen&s;ure.</HI> I do not believe any Gentleman, tho' a Barri&s;ter, was ever before &s;o treated, if he mi&s;took in a point of Law, which is not yet determined I did.</P>
<P>But indeeed, one would think the clo&s;e of this Article pen'd by a <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> or Non-Juror, &s;uch large Priviledge is given to the Altar, which if allowed, tends to protect Murtherers, Robbers or any Felones from being taken, if they Pre&s;ume but to come to the Lords Table.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second</HI> Article &s;ays, <HI>I took from one</HI> John Brown <HI>his Hor&s;e, without a&s;&s;igning him any rea&s;on for it, and detains him to this day.</HI> Surely your Excellency will not judge this a matter of that moment or con&s;equence <HI>to lay the A&s;&s;embly under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;o publick a Complaint, and that they &s;hould be wanting to the Country they repre&s;ent, if they &s;hould be &s;ilent in a cau&s;e that &s;o ju&s;tly requires their con&s;ideration, &amp;c.</HI> but on the contrary, that &s;o trivial and mean a thing, is fitter for a Ju&s;tice of Peace, or at mo&s;t, that Court where <HI>Brown</HI> has been advi&s;ed to &s;ue me, than your Excellencys Con&s;idera|tion. But it &s;erves to increa&s;e the number of Articles for them, and to convince your Lord&s;hip, what pains the promoters of the Addre&s;s have been forced to take, how low and much beneath the Dignity of an A&s;&s;embly, they are obleg'd &s;toop, to find &s;eeming Accu&s;ations: To which I &s;hall not trouble your Excellency with any further Reply, &s;ave that its untrue in all its parts, That I never took the Hor&s;e, detain'd, or have, or have had him in my Cu&s;tody, but lay the Proof upon them, before that Court where they have commenced their Action again&s;t me. This I could ea&s;ily manife&s;t to your Excellency, but judge in too incon&s;iderable for your Lord&s;hips notice; be&s;ides, it might be prejudicial to me, in my nece&s;&s;ary defence in its proper place.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, I cannot omit giving your Excellency another evident Demon&s;tration of the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the Addre&s;s, in mi&s;repre&s;enting this matter on bare &s;ugge&s;tion, either of &s;ome of the &s;aid Committee, or el&s;e their cheif Mannager, Mr. <HI>Willoks,</HI> for the which Mi&s;repre&s;entation there is as little foundation, even in the Report of the Committee it &s;elf, or what <HI>Brown</HI> &s;aid at the Committee, as the committee had warrant to meddle with the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, which was not referred to them.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="001431_0005_0FB2F3434B6870D0">The Addre&s;s &s;ays, <HI>Sometime after the poor Man</HI> (Brown) <HI>had commenced an Action again&s;t me to recover, if po&s;&s;ible, his Bea&s;t unju&s;tly detained from him, one</HI> Reeves <HI>complained again&s;t one</HI> Mellin <HI>a Taylor,</HI> &amp;c. in&s;inuating, and &s;o timing the matter, as if I had treated <HI>Brown</HI> &s;everely on the account of his carrying away <HI>Melin,</HI> to revenge the &s;uit which he, the &s;aid <HI>Brown</HI> had commenced again&s;t me. Whereas the Rever&s;e is true; for the matter of <HI>Mellin</HI> was long before <HI>Brown</HI> arre&s;ted me. <HI>Melins</HI> affair happening in <HI>May,</HI> and <HI>Browns</HI> Writ bears te&s;t in <HI>May</HI> Court, but was not &s;ealed until <HI>July,</HI> nor had I any notice of, or was arre&s;ted upon it until <HI>September</HI> following; from whence its evident, that <HI>Browns</HI> action again&s;t me for the Hor&s;e, might be the effect of <HI>Browns</HI> re&s;entment for being committed, but could never be any rea&s;on for my committing him, as is in&s;inuated.</P>
<P>Which brings me to the matter it &s;elf about <HI>Mellin.</HI> Your Excellency will here &s;ee the temper of &s;ome of the Leading Members of the A&s;&s;embly, who&s;e Rancor carries them &s;o far beyond their Rea&s;on, that they &s;tate the facts different from, nay, repugnant, not only to the Report of the &s;aid Committee, but al&s;o prevert what was &s;aid by the per&s;ons they examined, of which I &s;hall give your Excellency four particular In&s;tances.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The &s;aid Addre&s;s &s;ays, That <HI>one</HI> Revees <HI>complained against one</HI> Mellin <HI>a Taylor, for detaining a Coat of</HI> Reeves <HI>which I was plea&s;ed to call Felony, and was going to commit</HI> Mellin <HI>for Fellony.</HI> The Report is, That I i&s;&s;ued my Warrant to the Con&s;table to bring <HI>Mellin</HI> before me, <HI>upon</HI> John Revees <HI>his complaining of Fellony again&s;t &s;aid</HI> Millen.</P>
<P><HI>2ndly,</HI> The Addre&s;s goes on, <HI>Tho'</HI> Mellin <HI>proved, &amp;</HI> Reeves <HI>afterwards confe&s;t;</HI> Mellin <HI>only detained the Coat he had made, till</HI> Reeves <HI>&s;hould pay him for the making of it.</HI> This being joyned to the fore-going, it is to be taken, that this Proof of <HI>Mellin,</HI> and confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Reeves,</HI> were at the Examination. But the Report, and what was &s;aid, is quite otherwi&s;e (<HI>viz.</HI>) That I committed the &s;aid <HI>Brown</HI> into the Sheriffs Cu&s;tody, where he remained until Bailed out, <HI>altho'</HI> Reeves <HI>afterwards declared, that the &s;aid</HI> Mellin <HI>had not &s;tole the Coat, before pretended, but detained it for his pay.</HI> From whence its evident that this declaration of <HI>Reeves,</HI> if any &s;uch was, happened after <HI>Reeves</HI> was bailed out, and not at the Examination before me; and its plain, by the Report, from what <HI>A. Hudy</HI> &s;aid, and the Addre&s;s it &s;elf confe&s;&s;es, that it was &s;ome time before <HI>Brown</HI> was bailed; neither is there one word in all the Report, that <HI>Mellin</HI> proved that he detained the Coat for want of payment for making it; all which much alters the &s;tate of the ca&s;e; for when the matter was under examination before me, I could take no notice of di&s;cour&s;e that happened many days after.</P>
<P><HI>3dly</HI> The Addre&s;s tells your Excellency, <HI>That</HI> Mellin <HI>finding there was no contending with ab&s;olute Power, found a way to e&s;cape from me, and was &s;et over to</HI> Statten-I&s;land <HI>by the afore&s;aid</HI> Brown, <HI>who was altogether ignorant of what had happened.</HI> The Report is, <Q>At the de&s;ire of <HI>Mellin, John Brown</HI> carried him to <HI>Statten-I&s;land,</HI> and <HI>Brown</HI> told Committee, that he knew <HI>Mellin</HI> was in trouble.</Q> So that not one word of <HI>Ab&s;olute Power,</HI> nor any thing that appears like it, can be gathered either from the Report, or what was declared to the Committee.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001431_0006_0FB2F34687195E18"><HI>4thly,</HI> The Addre&s;s &s;ets forth, <Q>Upon which <HI>Sonmans,</HI> to gratifie his Re|&s;entment, contrary to Law, commits &s;aid <HI>Brown</HI> to Goal, and when the Sheriff had admitted him to Bail, he u&s;ed many Threats to him for his &s;o do|ing, ordering him to take him back again, telling him he would throw up his Commi&s;&s;ion and go to <HI>York,</HI> and de&s;ire my Lord to &s;end Souldiers to Rule them; Which Threat, and Fear of being governed by Martial Law, induced the Sheriff to take him into Cu&s;tody again, and keep him in Pri&s;on till my Lord <HI>Cornbury</HI> was plea&s;ed to allow he might be admitted to Bail.</Q> The Report is only thus, <Q>But the next day he committed <HI>John Brown,</HI> which after &s;ome time, he, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sheriff, admitted to be bailed out; at which <HI>Sonmans</HI> was very angry, and &s;aid, he would go to <HI>York</HI> to my Lord, and throw up his Commi&s;&s;ion, and de&s;ire my Lord to &s;end Souldiers to Rule them.</Q></P>
<P>Your Excellency &s;ees that here is no mention of any Threats, nor any Command of mine to take him into Cu&s;tody again, much le&s;s does the Sheriff &s;ay one word, That the Threats, or fear of being govern'd by Martial Law, induced him to take the Man again in Cu&s;tody, or that he could not be bailed until my Lord <HI>Cornbury</HI> was plea&s;ed to allow it, who, I believe, was never applyed to about it: This is all an Addition of the Contrivers of the Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>The next Sentence in the Addre&s;s, is, <Q>This Proceeding, as it was mo&s;t unlawful and unju&s;t, &s;o it tended not only to render her Maje&s;ties Subjects intirely depending on my Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> or tho&s;e he thought fit to honour with Magi&s;tracy, but to create in the Minds of People an aver&s;ion to her Maje&s;ties ju&s;t and mild Government, when by a humor, a Gentleman of the Council could Dragoon them at plea&s;ure.</Q></P>
<P>Here, <HI>My Lord,</HI> The Mannagers of the Addre&s;s prevail upon the Re|pre&s;entatives, to take upon them&s;elves, again, an ab&s;olute Power of a&s;&s;erting that Proceedings are mo&s;t Unlawful and Unju&s;t, when, in truth, they know not what the Proceedings are; for a learned Judge tells us, <HI>Examination without an Oath, is but loo&s;e Di&s;cour&s;e.</HI> So, upon loo&s;e di&s;cour&s;e, and that without hearing what the other &s;ide has to object to that loo&s;e di&s;cour&s;e, the Promoters of the Addre&s;s impo&s;e upon the Repre&s;entatives, to judge of the Lawful or Unlawfulne&s;s, and Ju&s;tice or Inju&s;tice of the Actions of the Officers of the Government. Whether this be a&s;&s;erting and protecting the Liberties and Properties of the Subject, or rendring them precarious, your Excellency will ea&s;ily judge?</P>
<P>How any thing, even the Addre&s;s, much le&s;s the Report &s;ays, can have the tendency by the Addre&s;s mentioned, I confe&s;s, I under&s;tand not, nor how thereby Her Maje&s;ties Subjects are intirely made depending on my Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> or tho&s;e he thought fit to honour with Magi&s;tracy. If <HI>Brown</HI> was unea&s;y under his Commitment, why did he not move for a <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> as the Law directs, and &s;o obtain his liberty, which my Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> nor any other Magi&s;trate, neither could or would have di&s;obeyed. What they mean by <HI>a Gentleman of the Council could Dragoon them at plea&s;ure,</HI> I prote&s;t I under &s;tand not. The Addre&s;&s;ers certainly de&s;igned not that Reflection upon me, because they and their Chief Mannager, Mr. <HI>Willoks,</HI> very well know that I had not the honour of &s;itting at that Board until &s;ome Months after; be&s;ides, not any Soldiers under

<P>But that your Excellency may be fully informed, l will pre&s;ume to relate the fact truly, purged from the Glo&s;&s;es put upon it. <HI>Reeves</HI> having taken <HI>Mellin</HI> with his Wife, as Inmates into part of his Hou&s;e, complained to me, that he mi&s;&s;ed &s;undry things, particularly &s;ome <HI>Rum,</HI> Wool, working Tools, and la&s;tly a Coat, <HI>Mellins</HI> had made for him, which <HI>Reeves</HI> had worn &s;everal times. That he the &s;aid <HI>Reeves</HI> being gone to work, <HI>Mellin</HI> had feloniou&s;ly taken this Coat, and carried it to another hou&s;e, where he and his Wife had retired, without giving him any the lea&s;t notice. Where|fore finding <HI>Millins</HI> had taken the Coat, he believes he might al&s;o have taken &s;ome of the other things; therefore prayed a Warrant again&s;t him, (which I granted.) When both appeared before me, <HI>Reeves</HI> took his Oath to his Complaint, and produced &s;ome Witne&s;&s;es, which affected <HI>Mellin</HI> as to the Wool: <HI>Mellin</HI> for his defence alledged, that he had made the Coat, confe&s;t the taking it out of the Hou&s;e when <HI>Reeves</HI> was abroad, and car|rying it away. I asked, if &s;ince he had made the Coat, he had not deli|vered it to <HI>Reeves,</HI> and whether <HI>Reeves</HI> had not many times worn it? If he had demanded payment of <HI>Reeves,</HI> and given him notice, that if he was not paid for the making he would take it in pawn? <HI>Mellin</HI> confe&s;t he delivered it to <HI>Reeves,</HI> and that <HI>Reeves</HI> had worn it, but could not prove he had either demanded payment for making, or given him notice, that he would &s;ecure the Coat if he was not paid. As to the Wool, and other things, he only an&s;wered, he knew nothing of them&punc; without making any reply to what the Evidences &s;aid relating to the Wool. I then told him, I mu&s;t commit him. Whil&s;t I was writing the Mittimus, I gave the Con&s;table charge of him, who let him e&s;cape, altho' I called to him expre&s;ly, that I &s;hould require him at his hands. Pre&s;ently after, I was informed, upon Oath, That <HI>John Brown</HI> had carried &s;aid <HI>Mellin</HI> over a Cannoe to <HI>Statten-I&s;land,</HI> tho' <HI>Brown</HI> was told the whole matter. Whereupon I &s;ent a War|rant for <HI>Brown;</HI> being come before me, I asked him &s;ome Que&s;tions about this affair, but he refu&s;ed to make any direct An&s;wer; whereupon I told him, he mu&s;t find Sureties to appear, and an&s;wer at the next Se&s;&s;ions; which he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed; and putting his Arms on his &s;ide, turned about &s;hort, and bid &s;ome of the Company get him hor&s;e, he would ride to Goal in &s;tate. I then committed him.</P>
<P>The next day, being told, That the Sheriff had taken upon him&s;elf to bail <HI>Brown,</HI> though commited as an acce&s;&s;ary to Felony; I went to <HI>Woodbridge</HI> to inform the Sheriff of his Error, and warn him of the Inconveniencies he might &s;uffer thereby. At the entrance into the Town, I met <HI>Brown,</HI> with the Con&s;table and another returning to <HI>Amboy.</HI> I enquired the rea&s;on thereof? The Con&s;table told me, The Sheriff had accepted of Bail I an&s;wered, That the Sheriff could not do that; and commanded the Con&s;table to bring <HI>Brown</HI> back before me; which, though often repeated, the Con&s;table utterly re|fu&s;ed to do. I went into the Town; ask't the Sheriff, by what Authority he bailed a Pri&s;oner &s;o committed? He told me, There were three Men bound
<PB N="8" REF="001431_0008_0FB2F34AB3C5CCA8">in One Thou&s;and Pound a piece to deliver <HI>Brown</HI> to him again, whenever he &s;hould be demanded. I advis'd him to demand him pre&s;ently; related to him what had happened with the Con&s;table, adding, That I would complain to my Lord of this Contempt, which if he would not direct to be pro&s;ecuted, I would lay down my Commi&s;&s;ion, for that it was to no purpo&s;e to keep it, if I could not be obeyed; and if People could not be ruled by the Laws, or the Civil Magi&s;trate, my Lord mu&s;t &s;end down Soldiers to compel them. The Sheriff, &s;en&s;ible of his Error, &s;ent for <HI>Brown</HI> again, and kept him until he thought fit to apply to the Secretary to be bailed, who immediately bailed him, without any direction or allowance of my Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> who, I be|lieve, was never &s;poke to about the Bailment, as is in&s;inuated by the Addre&s;s. I indeed complained to his Lord&s;hip of the Di&s;obedience of the Con&s;table, whom my Lord directed to be bound over, and the Grand Jury have found the Indictment again&s;t him. <HI>Mellin</HI> was afterwards taken up, but &s;oon bailed&punc; and the Attorney General preferred an Indictment to the Grand Jury again&s;t him la&s;t <HI>November</HI> Court, the Names of four Witne&s;&s;es being upon the back of the &s;aid Indictment, who were al&s;o Sworn; but the &s;aid grand Jury, of which Mr. <HI>Royce</HI> (the Chair-man of this Committee) was Fore|man) were plea&s;ed never to Return the &s;aid Indictment into the Court, nor &s;o much as &s;ent for one of the Witne&s;&s;es. Your Lord&s;hip will now judge whether my procedure is Unlawful and Unju&s;t: I humbly conceive, if a Ju&s;tice of Peace is not protected in the Execution of his Office, but is &s;uffered to be Affronted, his Commands di&s;obeyed, and tho&s;e he thinks fit to Commit, car|ried away out of the Government, that excellent Con&s;titution, which has provided &s;o u&s;eful an Officer, will &s;oon be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>But here I mu&s;t again take Notice to your Excellency, That &s;uppo&s;ing every thing in this Article alledged, was true, its not of that nature to lay the Repre&s;entatives under a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;o publick a Complaint, Or that they &s;hould be wanting to the Country they repre&s;ent, if they were &s;ilent, much le&s;s that it &s;o ju&s;tly requires their Con&s;ideration; fora&s;much as I am advi&s;ed, That the matter no way concerns them, becau&s;e the utmo&s;t the whole Charge can amount to, is, That I wrongfully committed <HI>Mellin</HI> and <HI>Brown,</HI> which if I did, they had their Remedy, in the ordinary cour&s;e of the Law, before the e&s;tabli&s;hed Courts, without pre&s;uming upon your Lord&s;hips time, who cannot, if they are wronged, adjudge them any Sa|tisfaction, but mu&s;t at la&s;t leave the matter to be determined by the Law.</P>
<P>The <HI>Third</HI> Accu&s;ation is in a Ca&s;e depending <HI>between the Queen and Mr</HI> John Harri&s;on, <HI>upon an Information exhibited by the Attorney General, he the &s;aid</HI> Sonmans <HI>endeavoured to per&s;wade the Sheriff to pack a Jury,</HI> as the Addre&s;s untruly relates. The Report, and what the Sheriff &s;aid at the Committee, being quite otherwi&s;e. I know not what the Addre&s;s means. The Sheriff &s;aid (according to the Report of the Committe) That it was upon a Tryal of <HI>John Harri&s;on,</HI> at a Supream Court at <HI>Burlington,</HI> in a Cau&s;e depending between the &s;aid <HI>Sonmans</HI> and <HI>Harri&s;on.</HI> So here the Cau&s;es differ. And in truth, I cannot make any An&s;wer to it, &s;ince I know nothing of the Matter. I had no Cau&s;es depending between <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> and my Self, that could come on, or were ready for Tryal at that Court at <HI>Burlington:</HI> If it was a Cau&s;e of the Queens, <HI>I</HI> had no bu&s;ine&s;s with it,
<PB N="9" REF="001431_0009_0FB2F34C4B5BAF30">nor was acquainted with any &s;teps taken, in order to bring it to Tryal, much le&s;s to pack a Jury; wherefore I ab&s;olutely deny the Charge, nor know any thing of the Fact, Cau&s;e or Time. I confe&s;s, I have many times advi&s;ed the Sheriff to be careful to get good Juries, and not to impannel any he thought Partial, or inclining to any Party; nor am &s;en&s;ible that I have therein committed any fault; tho', with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, <HI>I</HI> think the &s;aid Repre&s;entatives would have done well, and had rea&s;on enough to have en|quired into the Rea&s;on how &s;uch &s;trange both Grand and Petty Juries have been impannelled of late, who have all along gone directly contrary to the Charge given them by the Court, and the fulle&s;t Evidence that could be; and whether &s;ome others have not pack't Juries to their own purpo&s;e, which has occa&s;ioned &s;ome Pre&s;entments and Verdicts to go accordingly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fourth Article</HI> is repre&s;ented to your Excellency as a great In&s;tance of my Inju&s;tice and Partiality, but will, I doubt not, appear as much to my Advantage, as now it &s;eems the contrary, when it is truly related. The Fact, <HI>My Lord,</HI> is thus: <HI>Michael van Vechten</HI> (who, of the two mentioned in this Article, is more my Friend and Acquaintance than <HI>Alexander Walker</HI>) arre&s;ted <HI>Walker</HI> for 130 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in the Court of Common Pleas, in which Court there is a &s;tanding Rule, <HI>That all Writs &s;hall be &s;igned by the Party him&s;elf, or his Attorney.</HI> The Writ was not &s;igned by &s;aid <HI>Van Vechten,</HI> but by Mr. <HI>Gorden,</HI> who was not at that time allowed to practi&s;e as an Attorney. Mr. <HI>Gorden</HI> appeared for the Plantiff, <HI>Van Vechten;</HI> the Attorney General for the Defendent, <HI>Walker.</HI> The Cau&s;e being called, Mr. Attorney General for the Defendant, moved, that the Writ might abate, becau&s;e it bore Te&s;t in the Vacation, and was not &s;igned by <HI>van Vechten</HI> or his Attorney, as the Rule required. Being &s;en&s;ible that Mr. <HI>Gorden</HI> watched for an opportunity of Complaint again&s;t me, altho' he was not allowed to plead, I &s;uffered him to &s;ay all he could for his Clyent, only told him, He ought not; but however, gave way to his Pleading. After a long Debate <HI>I</HI> gave Judgment, That the Writ &s;hould abate, becau&s;e it bore Te&s;t in the Vacation; which is certainly a good Rea&s;on for Abatement. The Defendant thereupon made out his Bill of Co&s;ts, which, as the Ordinance allows, I taxed, tho' I cannot remember the Sum; but be it what it will, <HI>I</HI> dare maintain my Taxation, by the Ordinance then in force. As to what the Addre&s;s &s;ays, Where a Writ of the Plantiffs abates, no Co&s;ts ought to be paid: All former Practice in this Province Confutes &s;uch an A&s;&s;ertion. And that the unfairne&s;s of the Addre&s;s may more plainly appear, <HI>I</HI> mu&s;t add, That by the Oath of the Judge of &s;aid Court, I ought not to give Coun&s;el or Advice to either Party; yet the Addre&s;s accu&s;es me for not doing that, when it tells your Excellency in the &s;ame Article, <HI>That another Writ &s;igned in the &s;ame manner as that was, met with no Objection from me, but was allowed of.</HI> There was indeed another Cau&s;e called, between <HI>Jacob Arents</HI> Plantiff, and <HI>Robert Mellin</HI> Defendant, both who appeared in Per&s;on; The Plantiff moved for a Rule to oblige the De|fendant to plead to his Declaration, but the Defendant made no exception to the Writ, which <HI>I</HI> never &s;aw, nor indeed was it my bu&s;ine&s;s to look after it. From whence its evident, That except <HI>I</HI> had &s;een the Writ, and, con|trary to my Oath, been of Council for the Defendant, <HI>I</HI> could not make any Exception to it.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="001431_0010_0FB2F34DB2EFC3B0">But that the Partiality of the Addre&s;s, and particularly of Mr. <HI>Gorden,</HI> who only &s;poke to this matter before the Committee, may appear to your Excellency as clear as the Sun at Noon, <HI>I</HI> mu&s;t beg your Excellency will be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, That at at the very la&s;t Court of Pleas held at <HI>Amboy,</HI> the 11th of <HI>March,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gorden</HI> pleaded in Abatement for the Defendant to this very Writ they accu&s;e me of pa&s;&s;ing without being &s;igned by the Party, for that it was not &s;ign'd by the Party, according to the Rule of the Court; but before the Court gave Judgment, agreed to put in an i&s;&s;uable Plea. <HI>I</HI> told Mr. <HI>Gorden,</HI> if they had not agreed, <HI>I</HI> mu&s;t have given Judgment for the Defendant, becau&s;e the Rea&s;on pleaded for Abate|ment, was good.</P>
<P>Before I pa&s;s from this Article, I mu&s;t beg leave to repre&s;ent to your Excellency, That what ever the matter of Facts, here charged, are, they are not &s;uch as belong to the Repre&s;entatives, nor obliges them to &s;uch extraordinary Proceedings, &s;ince if I have erred, the party injured could and may yet have his Remedy at the e&s;tabli&s;hed Courts, and not by &s;uch unpre|&s;idented Methods.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fifth</HI> Article Complains of my <HI>refu&s;ing to bind</HI> Alexander Walker <HI>to the Peace, on pretence, That I was immediately going out of Town on your Lord&s;hips bu&s;ine&s;s, tho' I &s;taid in Town part of the next day;</HI> which Accu&s;a|tion I utterly deny; no regular Complaint being ever made to me. I confe&s;s, that on <HI>Sunday,</HI> about three of the Clock in the afternoon, as I was &s;itting at Dinner, and then ju&s;t going out of Town, Mr. <HI>Gorden</HI> told me a &s;tory to the purpo&s;e in the Addre&s;s &s;et forth; to which I an&s;wered, that I was to go out of Town as &s;oon as I &s;hould ri&s;e from the Table, that I &s;hould be back at night, and go away next morning early, therefore advi&s;ed him to apply to &s;ome other Ju&s;tice of the Peace, which he promi&s;ed to do. But I mu&s;t al&s;o inform your Excellency, that nothing of what Mr. <HI>Gorden</HI> &s;aid appeard to me, Him&s;elf confe&s;t it, all Hear-&s;ay; he was neither the Party hurt, or threatned to be hurt, had not &s;een any body hurt, or heard any threatned, nor &s;hewed me any Authority or reque&s;t from the grieved Party, if any there was, for what he did, much le&s;s made or offered to make Oath, as the Law requires, that any thing he &s;aid was true, or that any body was in any danger or fear; and all Examinations, without Oath, are but loo&s;e di&s;cour&s;e, upon which no Ju&s;tice can an&s;wer the binding any one over. And I have much rea&s;on to believe, the matter of fact was otherwi&s;e than Mr. <HI>Gorden</HI> reported, for tho' I returned at night, and went not out of Town until Ten the next morning, I heard nothing of Mr. <HI>Gorden,</HI> or the Pre&s;ons he pretended to appear for.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sixth</HI> Article relates to my own private particular Affairs: that matter is already brought before the Supream Court, where it mu&s;t have its determination, wherefore &s;hall not trouble your Excellency with any other an&s;wer, then, that I deny the fact. Tho' I cannot omit ob&s;erving to your Excellency that this cannot be any in&s;tance of my <HI>rendring the Liberties and Properties of her Maje&s;ties Subjects precarious,</HI> nor a Crime of that nature, <HI>as lays the &s;aid Repre&s;entatives under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;o publick a Complaint.</HI> Which if the &s;aid Repre&s;entatives &s;hould neglect, they &s;hould be wanting
<PB N="11" REF="001431_0011_0FB2F34F464DD4A0">to the Country they repre&s;ent, &s;ince the meane&s;t Court in the Province has power to take notice, and puni&s;h any &s;uch crime, when its proved before them. The whole matter is of &s;o mean and incon&s;iderable a nature, that the Mannagers of the &s;aid Addre&s;s ought to blu&s;h when they trouble your Lord&s;hip with &s;uch triffles; its a hard ca&s;e when an A&s;&s;embly are forced to &s;train the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, to &s;o great a degree, only to gratify the private revenge of a few of their Members.</P>
<P>The <HI>Seventh</HI> Article is of a piece with the former, to which I &s;hall therefore only an&s;wer, That I utterly deny the facts, for which &s;ome of the Members of the &s;aid Repre&s;entatives pre&s;ented me; that I have much rea&s;on to believe the Grand Jury them&s;elves did not believe what they brought in; but were impo&s;ed upon and over born by &s;ome, who never minded the Oath they had taken, and that tho&s;e Indictments are Fal&s;e, Scandalous and Malitious, invented for a handle to fling dirt, which plainly appears in their being &s;o laid and contrived, that the main accu&s;ations can never come regularly to be tryed, the &s;ham Indictment being found by an In|que&s;t not of the place where the fact is alledged to be committed.</P>
<P>I may boldly affirm to your Excellency, that I am not con&s;cious of any guilt, which can make me fear any hone&s;t Grand Jury, that will be bound by the Oath they take, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that they &s;hall not pre&s;ent any body for hatred or malice, or excu&s;e any for fear, favour or Affection) nor have ever after an unpre&s;idented manner hindred the Grand Inque&s;t from doing their Duty at the la&s;t, or any other Court.</P>
<P>What I did at the la&s;t Court of Se&s;&s;ions at <HI>Amboy,</HI> the 8th of <HI>March,</HI> your Excellency has been plea&s;ed to approve of, <HI>viz.</HI> Not to admit any to &s;erve upon the Grand Inque&s;t, who refus'd to take the Oaths to the Queen, as by Law required. This, <HI>My Lord,</HI> is what the Mannagers of the Addre&s;s are plea&s;ed to call <HI>Hindring a Grand Inquest from doing their Duty, after an unpre&s;idented manner;</HI> Tho' I may more truly &s;ay, That the &s;aid Inque&s;t being led by Mr. <HI>Willocks,</HI> who publickly declared, he would not take the Oaths, and was plea&s;ed to term it, <HI>Taking the Lords Name in vain,</HI> did, after an unpre&s;idented manner, with-draw from, and not attend the &s;aid Court, as they ought to have done. The Rea&s;on of which, and why the Sheriff did not &s;ummons another Grand Jury, as he was commanded, I pre|&s;ume the &s;aid Repre&s;entatives, or at lea&s;t &s;ome of them, know be&s;t, there being but too much Rea&s;on to believe, that whole matter was &s;o ordered by &s;ome Members of the Repre&s;entatives, who being con&s;cious of the Riots and Breaches of the Peace they had lately been guilty of, were ju&s;tly appre|hen&s;ive of their Crimes, and would not e&s;cape due Pro&s;ecution. How care|ful &s;ome of the Repre&s;entatives have been of tolerating <HI>evil Examples,</HI> How Anxious to pre&s;erve the <HI>Liberties and Properties of the Subjects from being precarious;</HI> Whether they have been <HI>wanting to the Country they repre&s;ent;</HI> Whether they have been <HI>&s;ilent in a Cau&s;e that might ju&s;tly require their Con|&s;ideration;</HI> and la&s;tly, Whether they protect tho&s;e that publickly &s;tand up in Defiance again&s;t many Acts of Parliament? I &s;hall leave to your Excel|lencys ju&s;t Considerations, when your Excellency &s;hall plea&s;e to reflect, that all this Accu&s;ation is only becau&s;e I would oblige a Grand Jury-man to take the Oaths, which, it &s;eems, is &s;o great a Crime, in the Eyes of many of the
<PB N="12" REF="001431_0012_0FB2F3522AD19FC8">Representatives, that it <HI>lays them under a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;o publick a Complaint again&s;t me.</HI></P>
<P>To the <HI>Eighth</HI> and <HI>la&s;t Article, I</HI> &s;ay, and confe&s;s, That in four Criminal Cau&s;es depending before, and tryed this la&s;t Court of Se&s;&s;ions at <HI>Amboy, I</HI> did not admit a <HI>Quaker</HI> to &s;erve on the Jury, which I have no doubt but your Excellency will be plea&s;ed to approve of, for the following Rea&s;ons,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e I never heard, by any In&s;truction of her Maje&s;ty, the <HI>Quakers</HI> were admitted to be upon Jurys. I have heard, and do believe, that an In&s;truction to the purpo&s;e following, may have been given, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Whereas we are informed, that divers of our good Subjects inhabiting tho&s;e Parts, do make a Religious Scruple of Swearing; and by rea&s;on of their refu&s;ing to take an Oath in Courts of Ju&s;tice, and other Places, are or may be liable to many Inconveniencies, Our Will and Plea&s;ure is, that in order to their ea&s;e, in what they conceive to be matter of Con&s;cience, &s;o far as may be con&s;i&s;tent with good order and Government, you take care, that an Act be pa&s;&s;ed in the General A&s;&s;embly of our &s;aid Province, to the like effect as that pa&s;t here in the <HI>Seventh</HI> and <HI>Eighth</HI> year of his late Maje&s;ties Reign, Entituled, <HI>An Act that the Solemn Affirmation or Declaration of the People called</HI> Quakers <HI>&s;hall be accepted in&s;tead of an Oath, in the u&s;ual form;</HI> and that the Law be tran&s;mitted to Us, and Our Commi&s;&s;ioners for Trade and Plantations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, <HI>I</HI> humbly conceive this &s;o far from allowing them to &s;erve upon any Jury, that it does not &s;o much as direct that they &s;hall have the benefit of the Act there mentioned; but on the contrary, from the very words, it plainly appears, that her Maie&s;ty gave no direction again&s;t that Law, nor allowed, much le&s;s directed that they &s;hould have the ea&s;e by that Law given them, but that they are, or may &s;till be liable to the many Inconveniencies in this Province, to which they were expo&s;ed in <HI>England</HI> before that Act was made; for, if otherwi&s;e, what Rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for the&s;e words in the In&s;truction, <Q>Our Will and Ple&s;ure is, that in order to their Ea&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> you take care that an Act be pa&s;&s;ed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Likewi&s;e, the&s;e fore-going, <Q>And by rea&s;on of their refu&s;ing to take an Oath in Courts of Ju&s;tice, and other Places, are or may be liable to many Inconve|niences.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e even by that In&s;truction, whereby Her Maje&s;ty has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to admit the <HI>Quakers</HI> to bear and &s;hare in &s;everal Offices in this Goverment, nothing is contained, as I am advi&s;ed, that can be con&s;trued to extend to permitting them to &s;erve on Juries; which will plainly appear to your Excellency from the In&s;truction it &s;elf, which I have heard, and do believe, may be in the&s;e words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>And whereas we have been farther Informed, that in the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the Government of our &s;aid Province, it may &s;o happen, that the number of Inhabitants fitly qualified to &s;erve in our Council, and in the General A&s;&s;embly, and in other places of Tru&s;t or Profit there, will be but &s;mall, It is therefore our Will and Plea&s;ure, that &s;uch of the &s;aid People, called <HI>Quakers,</HI> as &s;hall be found capable of any of tho&s;e Places or imployments,
<PB N="13" REF="001431_0013_0FB2F3555D2FF450">and accordingly be elected or appointed to &s;erve therein, may upon their taking and &s;igning the Declaration of their Allegiance to us, in the form u&s;ed by the &s;ame People here in <HI>England,</HI> together with a Solemn Decla|ration for the true di&s;charge of their re&s;pective Tru&s;ts, be admitted by you into any of the &s;aid Places or Imployments.</Q></P>
<P>From which words in the Preamble, <HI>We have been informed, that in the fir&s;t Settlement of the Government,</HI> it is plain that that In&s;truction took its ri&s;e only from Information: Again&s;t the truth of which, I &s;hall not trouble your Excellency with any arguments here, tho' the contrary, I am a&s;&s;ured of from many good hands. But, <HI>my Lord,</HI> here is not one word of being admitted <HI>to &s;erve on Juries,</HI> in the whole In&s;truction; it &s;eems to be re|&s;trained to the Council, General A&s;&s;embly and other Places of Tru&s;t or Profit, under which denomination that of <HI>a Jury-Man,</HI> as I humbly con|ceive, cannot well be accounted.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, your Excellency will plea&s;e to Remark, That the Preamble gives the Rea&s;on of this In&s;truction, <HI>viz. That in the fir&s;t Settlement it may &s;o happen, that the Number of Inhabitants fitly qualified to &s;erve,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>will be but &s;mall.</HI> It is therefore plainly intimating, That if there were a &s;ufficient Number to &s;erve, that In&s;truction would not have been given. Now, <HI>My Lord,</HI> in this Cau&s;e complained of, a &s;ufficient Number to &s;erve were impan|nelled; &s;o that, at be&s;t, an Officer may err in admitting a <HI>Quaker,</HI> but can|not (with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion) if he does not.</P>
<P><HI>3rdly,</HI> Becau&s;e the la&s;t Clau&s;e, but one, of the Act of the 7 &amp; 8 of <HI>William</HI> the 3d, mentioned by her Maje&s;ties In&s;tructions, and recommended to be pa&s;t here, in order to the ca&s;e of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in expre&s;s words forbids it; which, for the more certainty, <HI>I</HI> &s;hall pre&s;ume to trouble your Excellency with, and are the&s;e:
<Q>Provided, and be it Enacted, That no <HI>Quaker</HI> or reputed <HI>Quaker,</HI> &s;hall, by virtue of this Act, be qualified or permitted to give Evidence in any Criminal Cau&s;es, or <HI>&s;erve on any J&V;RY,</HI> or bear any Office or Place of Profit in the Government, any thing this Act to the contrary in any wise notwith&s;tanding.</Q></P>
<P>The Conclu&s;ion of the &s;aid Addre&s;s is &s;o very extraordinary, that I would not any way alter it, but &s;hall repeat the words, <Q>Were there no more to be &s;aid again&s;t him than his being indicted for Perjury and Adultry, we humbly conceive would ju&s;tifie what we are to de&s;ire of your Lord&s;hip, a Per&s;on of that Character being a &s;candal to her Maje&s;ties Council; and we believe your Excellency will think it a Reflection on the publick Admi|ni&s;tration to continue him in that Station; We therefore pray, that your Excellency would remove him from your Pre&s;ence, her Maje&s;ties Council, and from all Places of Tru&s;t and Profit in this Province.</Q> So That the &s;aid Repre&s;entatives in very plain Terms de&s;ire your Excellency, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> To Condemn me unheard, or before any thing is proved again&s;t me, upon their bare Affirmation, as a Scandal to her Maje&s;ties Council, and that it will be a Reflection on the Publick Admini&s;tration to continue me in that Station. Therefore, <HI>2dly,</HI> with the &s;ame ju&s;tice, they pray your Excellency to pro|ceed to Execution, <HI>viz.</HI> To Remove me from your Excellency's Pre&s;ence. Her Maje&s;tys Council, and from all Places of Tru&s;t and Profit in this
<PB N="14" REF="001431_0014_0FB2F3576A9DC658">Province. I hope your Excellency will plea&s;e to Pardon me, if I &s;ay, This De&s;ire and Prayer of the &s;aid Repre&s;entatives is directly contrary to the Liberties and Properties of the Subject, to the expre&s;s words of the Great Charter of <HI>England,</HI> The Petition of Right, the many other &s;ub&s;equent good Laws, that in all Reigns have been Enacted for the benefit of the Queens Subjects, and only to be equalled under a <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Go|vernment; therefore the mo&s;t Unju&s;t and Unrea&s;onable that evere were made.</P>
<P>For, were nothing to be &s;aid again&s;t the Form and Sub&s;tance of the &s;aid Indictment, as much there is; were they found (as a Grand Inque&s;t ought to be) by impartial unprejudiced Men, the contrary of which is evident, the chief Men being known to be my profe&s;&s;ed Enemies, becau&s;e I have many Demands on them in Civil Cau&s;es, had they been brought into the Court in the u&s;ual manner, which they were not, but in a Me|thod altogether &s;trange, or had they been without any manner of other Objection, yet even then, your Excellency knows, they are only a bare Affirmation, to which the Party never had any Opportunity of being heard, much le&s;s making any Defence. For which rea&s;on the Law directs, That the Party &s;hall be &s;ummoned, not to be judged, much le&s;s con|demned, but heard, that Time and Opportunity may be given him to make his Defence and invalidate the Evidence, which may have been Wrongfully or Maliciou&s;ly given again&s;t him. But this bare Accu&s;a|tion shall, by the De&s;ire of the Addre&s;&s;ers, who ought to be the mo&s;t careful Protectors of the Liberties of the Province, as far as the Law directs, nay, to make new Laws to help the Defects of the former, if Occa&s;ion requires it, be deemed &s;o full a Conviction and Proof, that Judg|ment and Execution shall follow upon it.</P>
<P>By this Rule, <HI>My Lord,</HI> any Gentleman who has the honour of &s;erving the Queen, or any other Officer of the Government, shall be Turned out, Ruined in his Reputation (which ought to be dearer to him than his Life) and treated as a high Criminal, Convicted without being heard, or any Proof again&s;t him, while&s;t his only Crime is, that a few leading Men, tho' his known Enemies, have Intere&s;t enough with a Sheriff to be returned on a Grand Inque&s;t.</P>
<P>But, <HI>My Lord,</HI> the matter of this Addre&s;s is yet more extravagant; for all Examinations of the Grand Inque&s;t are upon Oath, but much of what I am charged with, in the &s;aid Addre&s;s, is only upon a bare Rela|tion given, without the Life of an Oath, or any thing el&s;e to oblige the Relator to &s;peak the Truth, mannaged by one, who publickly refu&s;es to give any a&s;&s;urance of his Allegiance to the Queen, or Fidelity to the e&s;tabli&s;hed Government. And for &s;everal other Charges, they do not by the Report of the Committee, or any other Proceedings of the A&s;&s;embly, appear to have been &s;o much as told the &s;aid Repre&s;entatives, but mu&s;t be things framed by the Mannagers of the Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Your Excellency will be plea&s;ed to Remember, what a learned and ju&s;t Judge has left as a &s;tanding Rule, viz. <HI>That all Que&s;tions and Tryals, where Witne&s;&s;es are examined, the Examination is upon Oath by the Law, by all our Books, Statutes, and every days Practice; Examination without an Oath is but loo&s;e Di&s;cour&s;e.</HI> Yet the Promoters of the &s;aid Addre&s;s,
<PB N="15" REF="001431_0015_0FB2F358E5E4DDE0">prevail upon the Repre&s;entatives, to take upon them&s;elves a much greater Power than the Hou&s;e of Commons it &s;elf ever claimed, <HI>viz.</HI> not only of Examining, but Condemning, and praying Execution. Whereas the Hou&s;e of Commons, even in Impeachments for High-Trea&s;on, High Crimes and Mi&s;demeanours, never pray any farther, but that the Per|&s;on Impeached may be put to an&s;wer for all and every of the Premi&s;es, and that &s;uch Proceedings, Examinations, Tryals and Judgments may be upon every of them, as is agreeable to Law and Ju&s;tice. The &s;ame Judge &s;ays, in another place, <HI>Magna Charta, The Petition of Right, and other good Laws of the Land, ordain, That Mens Tryals &s;hould be by the e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws, and not otherwise; That they are the very words of the Petition of Right.</HI></P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of which, Lords, upon Impeachments of the Hou&s;e of Commons, are tryed before the Hou&s;e of Lords, and if the &s;aid Hou&s;e of Commons find rea&s;on to accu&s;e a Commoner, they proceed not to condemning, and addre&s;&s;ing that he may be removed from all his Places of Tru&s;t and Profit, but that direction may be given, that he be pro&s;ecuted, in order to his acquitting and di&s;charging him&s;elf of the Crimes laid to his charge, if he can, or el&s;e of being legally convicted; which Pro&s;ecution mu&s;t be by the e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws, which Laws the Act of the <HI>twelf and thirteenth</HI> of <HI>William</HI> the 3d, for the further Limitation of the Crown and better &s;ecu|ring the the Rights and Liberties of the Subiects, &s;ays&punc; <HI>are the Birth Right of the People of England.</HI> I &s;hall not need to trouble your Excellency here with a relation of what happened on the occa&s;ion of the Impeachments of the Hou&s;e of Commons, again&s;t my Lord <HI>Oxford,</HI> my Lord <HI>Sommers,</HI> my Lord <HI>Portland,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Hallifax,</HI> and that the Hou&s;e of Lords re&s;olved &s;o, and did Addre&s;s his late Maje&s;ty, that his Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed not to pa&s;s any Cen&s;ure upon their Lord&s;hips, until after their Lord&s;hips &s;hould be tryed upon the &s;aid Impeachments, and Judgment be given according to the u&s;age of Parliament and the Laws of the Land, becau&s;e your Excel|lency being a Member of that Noble Hou&s;e, and pre&s;ent at mo&s;t of tho&s;e Proceedings, mu&s;t be better acquainted with them, than I can, and will not fail of making due Reflections thereon.</P>
<P>But contrary to all this, the &s;aid Addre&s;s prays your Excellency, as I &s;aid before, to Condemn me, nay, go on to Execution, without any &s;uch Examination, before any Tryal by the e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws, without any legal Evidence, before being heard, and all in a &s;ummary way, with|out any Judicial Proceedings what&s;oever.</P>
<P>How far the Advi&s;ers of the Addre&s;s, by this Conclu&s;ion, and indeed the whole Addre&s;s ju&s;tly entitules them to the &s;everal Crimes of <HI>Illegally u&s;ing the Power they are cloathed with,</HI> to the great hurt of her Maje&s;ties Subjects, giving an <HI>Evil Example,</HI> and rendring <HI>Liberties and Properties precarious,</HI> and at the di&s;po&s;al of every A&s;&s;embly, that &s;hall make Envy and Spleen, and not the good of their Country, the Rule of their Actions; whether they, by their unpre&s;idented ways, lay not them&s;elves under the Nece&s;&s;ity of publick Cen&s;ure?

Whether they de&s;erve not Publick Reproof, that thus u&s;e the Places they &s;it in, &s;o contrary to the <HI>end for which they are &s;ent?</HI> Whether this does not tend to render <HI>her Majesties Subjects entirely Depending</HI> on the Caprice of a Party in an A&s;&s;embly, and <HI>Create in the Minds of People an Aver&s;ion to her Maje&s;ties just and mild Government,</HI> when &s;ome leading Men in an A&s;&s;embly can Di&s;place any of the Council at their Plea&s;ure, without being allowed to &s;peak for him&s;elf, or having the Accu&s;ation proved again&s;t him? Whe|ther they encourage not Grand Inque&s;ts to Neglect doing their Duty, and di&s;courage Magi&s;trates from tendring the Oathes to the Queen and Go|vernment, pre&s;cribed by &s;undry Acts of Parliament?

<P>That the &s;aid Court of Se&s;&s;ions being very well a&s;&s;ured of their Authority to admini&s;ter &s;aid Oaths, and informed, that &s;aid <HI>Willocks</HI> had never taken them, ordered their Clerk to get the Rolls, in which &s;aid Oaths were con|tained, in order to tender them to &s;aid <HI>Willocks;</HI> but &s;aid <HI>Willocks</HI> then po&s;itively declared, if the Rolls were there, he would not take them, for that he would not take the name of the Lord in vain; and that he having attended and an&s;wered to his Name, &s;hould or did not think him. If obliged to attend &s;aid Court any longer, or words to that effect.</P>
<P>The Clerk not having &s;aid Rolls, the &s;aid Court of Se&s;&s;ions prayed the Secretary to lend them the Rolls he had, but the Secretary making &s;ome objections thereto, the &s;aid Court adjourned to three a Clock in the after|noon, in order to procure the old Rolls belonging to this County, or new ones.</P>
<P>That the &s;aid old Roll not being to be found, your Petitioner immediately employed the Door-keeper of the Council to prepare new ones, which, notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t diligence, could not be in a readine&s;s until about &s;ix in the evening.</P>
<P>That immediately after the &s;aid Rolls were tran&s;cribed the &s;aid Court opened again, and the &s;aid per&s;ons &s;ummon'd, to attend, as afore&s;aid, were again called upon, but not one attending or an&s;wering to their Names, the &s;aid Court re&s;olved not to proceed (as indeed they ought to have done) to fine &s;aid Defaulters, becau&s;e they would not be deemed too &s;erve, but adjourned until the next day at nine a Clock in the morning.</P>
<P>That the &s;aid Court opened again, according to their adjournment, and called over the Pannel, but only one an&s;wered &s;aid Call, altho divers were about the Court: whereupon &s;aid Court &s;eeing their Authority oppo&s;ed in a very-high degree, proceeded to fine the &s;aid Defaulters according to Law.</P>
<P>That notwith&s;tanding the great lenity of &s;aid-Court, the &s;aid <HI>George Willocks</HI> with fifteen others of the &s;aid Defaulters, have pre&s;ented a very Scurrelous, Malicious and Scandalous Petition again&s;t your Petitioner, to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, a Copy of which is hereunto annexed: the allegations of which are not only fal&s;e in fact, but likewi&s;e very opprobrious and injurious to your Petitioner, who could not in duty act otherwi&s;e then he has done.</P>
<P>That your Petitioner not being con&s;cious of any guilt, is not afraid of any Indictments, except &s;uch as meer Malice or Envy, without any ground or poof, where partys are Judges, can &s;ugge&s;t, of which nature tho&s;e are in the Petition mentioned, and writ by the own hands of &s;aid <HI>Willocks</HI> tho' not of that Inque&s;t: That &s;uch Proceedings and Affronts are wholly unpre&s;idented, highly di&s;honouring Her Maje&s;tys Government, tending to
<PB N="21" REF="001431_0021_0FB2F36729B59108">the great encouragment of Non-Jurors, &s;ubverting the very being and Authority of Courts, and di&s;couragement of the Judges and Ju&s;tices of the re&s;pective Courts from doing their duty. <HI>Your Petitioner therefore humbly prays,</HI></P>
<P>That your Excellency and the Honourable Council will be plea&s;ed to put an effectual &s;top to &s;uch &s;editious Practices, and order &s;uch &s;uitable &s;atisfaction to your Petitioner, and qive &s;uch further directions as your Excellency in your great Wi&s;dom &s;hall judg proper and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>And this deponent further &s;aith, That &s;ome time in the &s;aid Month of <HI>May,</HI> he this deponent heard one <HI>John Reeves</HI> make a complaint to Mr. <HI>Sonmans,</HI> That one <HI>Mellin,</HI> a Taylor (to whom and his Wife) <HI>Reeves</HI> had let part of his hou&s;e, had left his hou&s;e when he was gone out, and taken with them a Coat which the Taylor had made for <HI>Reeves,</HI> and he had worn &s;everal times; That he mi&s;t &s;everal other things out of his hou&s;e, to wit, &s;ome Rum, wooll and working Tools, which he &s;upected <HI>Mellin</HI> and his Wife might have taken, whereupon prayed Mr. <HI>Sonmans</HI> to grant him a Warrant to bring <HI>Mellin</HI> be|fore him, which Mr. <HI>Sonmans</HI> having granted, <HI>Mellin</HI> was brought before him, who examined him upon <HI>Reeves</HI> Complaint.

That Mr. <HI>Sonmans</HI> told <HI>Mellin</HI> he mu&s;t commit him, but while Mr. <HI>Sonmans</HI> was writing the mittimus, <HI>Mellin</HI> was going away, which being told Mr. <HI>Sonmans,</HI> he cal|led to the Con&s;table that he &s;hould take care of <HI>Mellin,</HI> being committed to his charge, or words to that effect. But that the Con&s;table neverthele&s;s &s;uffered <HI>Mellin</HI> to e&s;cape, and that one <HI>John Brown</HI> carried him to <HI>Statten-I&s;land,</HI> whereupon Mr. <HI>Sonmans</HI> i&s;&s;ued out a Warrant to bring <HI>Brown</HI> before him, but that <HI>Brown</HI> would make little an&s;wer to &s;everal Que&s;tions put to him about his conveying <HI>Mellin</HI> away. That Mr. <HI>Sonmans</HI> told <HI>Brown</HI> he mu&s;t
<PB N="22" REF="001431_0022_0FB2F368A514B4D0">find &s;urety to appear, and an&s;wer it the next Quarter Se&s;&s;ions, which <HI>Brown</HI> refu&s;ed, and putting his Arms on his &s;ide, asked &s;ome of the company for a Hor&s;e, and &s;aid, he would ride to Goal in &s;tate.</P>
<P>That the next day this Deponent rid with Mr. <HI>Sonmans</HI> to <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> that at the entrance into the Town, they were met by the Con&s;table and <HI>John Brown,</HI> upon which Mr. <HI>Sonmans</HI> commanded the Con&s;table &s;everal times to bring <HI>Brown</HI> back into the Town, before him, but that the Con&s;table did not do it. That this deponent with Mr. <HI>Sonmans,</HI> went to the Sheriff, whom <HI>Sonmans</HI> asked, how he came to Bail <HI>Brown?</HI> That the Sheriff &s;aid, he had three Men bound in one Thou&s;and Pound, a peice for <HI>Browns</HI> appearance when he &s;hould demand him. Upon which Mr. <HI>Sonmans</HI> advi&s;ed the Sheriff to &s;end for him again immediately, for that he could not an&s;wer what he had done, and related to him how di&s;obedient the Coun&s;table had been, of which Mr. <HI>Sonmans</HI> &s;a id, he would complain to my Lord, and pray that he might be pro&s;ecuted for it. That this Deponent afterwards heard that <HI>Brown</HI> remained in the Sheriffs Cu&s;tody until he was bailed out.</P>
<P>And this deponent further &s;aith, That on or about the 9th of <HI>January</HI> la&s;t this deponant was at dinner with Mr. <HI>Sonmans</HI> about three of the Clock in the afternoon, being to go with Mr. <HI>Sonmans</HI> to vi&s;it a &s;ick per&s;on as &s;oon as they &s;hould ri&s;e from the Table, that ju&s;t before Dinner was over, Mr. <HI>Gorden</HI> came and told Mr. <HI>Sonmans,</HI> that he had heard that <HI>Alexander Walker</HI> had beat his Wife, and threatned or attempted to kill his Wifes Son, one <HI>Iohn <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">overidge,</HI> praying that <HI>Walker</HI> might be bound to the Peace.
