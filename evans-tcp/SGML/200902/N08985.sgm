<HEAD>Some Account of the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of the Cha|ritable Corporation, "for the Relief of the Wi|dows and Children of Clergymen, in Communion of the Church of <HI>ENGLAND</HI> in America."</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances, in which the Epi&s;copal Clergy in the more northern provinces of America, and e&s;pecially the Mi&s;&s;ionaries in the &s;ervice of the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel, have too frequently been obliged to leave their families, had long been matter of di&s;|couragement to many from entering into the mini&s;try of our Church, as well as of regret to pious and worthy mem|bers thereof.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;undry overtures, from time to time, it was at length re&s;olved, at a meeting of the clergy at Elizabeth-Town, in New-Jer&s;ey, October 1767, to appoint a com|mittee to frame &s;ome plan of provi&s;ion for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed wi|dows and children of &s;uch of our clergy as &s;hould die in nar|row or nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances. In pur&s;uance of this ap|pointment, the reverend Dr. Auchmuty, Rector of Trinity Church, the reverend Dr. Cooper, Pre&s;ident of King's Col|lege, both of New-York, the reverend Mr. Cooke, Mi&s;|&s;ionary in Monmouth county, New-Jer&s;ey, and my&s;elf, met at Perth-Amboy, May 12, 1768; and drew up a &s;cheme for the approbation of our brethren; recommending it to them to &s;ollicit charters in each of the three provinces of New-York, New-Jer&s;ey and Penn&s;ylvania, that we might be a body corporate, in which ever of the&s;e provinces we might have occa&s;ion to meet.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="011469_0004_0F83301953E0A750">THIS &s;cheme having obtained the approbation of &s;everal &s;ucceeding meetings of the clergy, and a draft of a charter being &s;ettled, two per&s;ons were appointed in each province to &s;ollicit the pa&s;&s;ing thereof; viz. the reverend Dr. Auch|muty, and Dr. Cooper, in New-York; the reverend Mr. Cooke, and Mr. Odell, in New-Jer&s;ey; and the reverend Mr. Peters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rector of Chri&s;t-Church and St. Peters, Philadelphia.</NOTE>, and my&s;elf, in Penn&s;ylvania. And ju&s;tice requires, that the mo&s;t public and grateful te&s;timony &s;hould be given of that readine&s;s and cheerfulne&s;s, with which the &s;everal Governors con&s;ented to the grant of the charters in their re&s;pective provinces.</P>
<P>THE charter for Penn&s;ylvania was obtained the 7th of February la&s;t; the honorable JOHN PENN, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the Go|vernor, having ordered the &s;eal to be put to it on the fir&s;t application. And the worthy and honorable Proprietaries of the province, as &s;oon as the de&s;ign was made known to them in London, took the earlie&s;t opportunity to &s;ignify their hearty approbation of it, and wi&s;hes for its &s;ucce&s;s. His Excellency, Governor FRANKLIN, &s;hewed the &s;ame readine&s;s, and the charter for New-Jer&s;ey was compleated in May. That for New-York, altho' cheerfully a&s;&s;ented to by his Excellency Sir HENRY MOORE, Baronet, was de|layed by his indi&s;po&s;ition and death; but the pa&s;&s;ing it was one of the fir&s;t acts of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the honorable Lieu|tenant Governor COLDEN, who put the &s;eal to it, the 29th of September la&s;t.</P>
<P>AS it will be of u&s;e, to the members of the corporation e&s;pecially, that each of them &s;hould have a copy of their charters to have recour&s;e to, as occa&s;ion may require, I &s;hall here in&s;ert that for New-York; not meaning thereby any other preference than what is u&s;ually claimed by that co|lony, in virtue of &s;eniority, among her &s;i&s;ter ones.</P>

<P>As the fir&s;t meeting appointed by each charter, was to be on the Tue&s;day and Wedne&s;day next following the Fea&s;t of St. Michael, 1769, which were the 3d and 4th of this pre&s;ent October; mo&s;t of the Clerical, and &s;undry of the Lay Members, met accordingly at Burlington, in New-Jer|&s;ey, on Tue&s;day, October 3d; and the Pre&s;ident having ta|ken the chair, the different Charters were read, and com|pared with each other.</P>

<P>AMIDST a very imperfect &s;y&s;tem of Morality, even in the Heathen-world, the voice of God, &s;peaking in the hearts of men, had carried their Le&s;&s;ons of Benevolence to a more exalted pitch, than mo&s;t other branches of their Doctrine; in &s;o much, that &s;ome of their Sages could embrace, in the calm Wi&s;h of PHILANTHROPY, the whole <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Homo &s;um; humani nihil a me alienum puto.</NOTE> human &s;pecies.</P>
<P>BUT it was from the Scriptures of GOD, and particular|ly from the divine Documents of our SAVIOUR and his A|po&s;tles, that the doctrine of UNIVERSAL LOVE AND CHA|RITY, received its fini&s;hing lu&s;tre, and was placed on its true foundation&punc; Altho' the motives to this heavenly vir|tue be &s;trong, both in the Old and New-Te&s;tament, yet are they carried infinitely farther in the Latter, and pre&s;&s;ed home upon nobler and more animating principles.</P>
<P>TRUE it is, that no writer can expre&s;s a more amiable Spirit of Benevolence, nor recount his acts of Mercy and Kindne&s;s, with more con&s;cious delight and complacency, than the author of the book of Job; as well in the pa&s;&s;age before us, as el&s;ewhere&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>WHEN the ear heard me, then it ble&s;&s;ed me; when the eye &s;aw me, then it gave witne&s;s to me</Q>&mdash;and why? <Q>BECAUSE I delivered the Poor that cried, and the FA|THERLESS, and him that had none to help him. The ble&s;&s;ing of him that was ready to peri&s;h came upon me, and I cau&s;ed the WIDOW's heart to &s;ing for joy.</Q></P>

For this would be, in effect, to claim all tho&s;e things as my own ab&s;olute and perfect property, which are only given me in tru&s;t by my benevolent Maker. It would be denying that the Almighty reigns in heaven Above, the &s;ole and ab&s;olute &s;ource of eve|ry thing we enjoy here Below. In &s;uch ca&s;e, ju&s;tly might He re-claim his own, &s;trip me of all his bounty hath given me, turn me naked into the world, leave the wife of my bo|&s;om de&s;titute, and my children, in their turn, to beg in vain for that bread which my unfeeling heart refu&s;ed to others.</P>

And here the danger was, that attentive only to the Letter of the Law, and its awful Sanctions, but not di&s;cerning its divine Spi|rit, the outward offices of LOVE and BENEFICENCE, might be fulfilled from Carnal motives&mdash;to &s;ecure the Divine fa|vour in this world&mdash;as con&s;idering that the more liberally they might give, the more liberally they would be &s;upplied, of God's infinite bounty.

<P>OF this Spirit were tho&s;e who affected <Q>to be&s;tow their Alms before men.</Q> But when JESUS CHRIST came to give a more noble foundation to the Law of LOVE and CHA|RITY, this O&s;tentatious Spirit met with his early reprehen|&s;ion. Altho' he did not annul the Old Te&s;tament motives to Love and Alms-giving, he added new ones, infinitely more powerful and animating. He placed Life and Im|mortality before us. He taught us that we were Candidates for an Eternity of Glory, which none could be fit to in|herit, but they who, having the LOVE OF GOD &s;hed abroad in their Hearts, did, for his &s;ake, Love all his CREATURES, and prepare their Souls for the final enjoyment of Him, thro' the con&s;tant exerci&s;e of every act of Kindne&s;s and Mercy here below. And in the rapturous glimp&s;es he gives us of this future and eternal bli&s;s, and of that awful pro|ce&s;s and &s;entence which is to fix the doom of mankind&mdash; CHARITY to the Poor, the Sick, and the Needy, is made the grand Preparation of the Heart, for all that we can hope to enjoy from him.</P>

<P>IN this evangelic view, well might LOVE be &s;tiled a New Law; as founded not in a mere Regard to almighty Ju&s;tice, or Fear of almighty Judgment; but in a Heart that is ca&s;t into the very Mold of LOVE it&s;elf&mdash;in a Temper that is Angelic, nay, even Seraphic, Godlike, Divine, and alrea|dy &s;o rai&s;ed above this world, as to be daily ripening for the world to come!</P>

<P>IF therefore, we would wi&s;h to under&s;tand this e&s;&s;ential Doctrine aright, and to be truly actuated by the Life and Spirit of Heavenly Love, a &s;hort analy&s;is of our Apo&s;tle's arguments, will be of the utmo&s;t u&s;e; and al&s;o be the be&s;t introduction I can give to the recommendation of that par|ticular Branch of Charity; for which I have the honor to be appointed an humble advocate before you.</P>
<P>THERE had &s;tarted up, in the Church of Corinth (as there hath, alas! in many churches &s;ince) a &s;ett of men, who being elated with an over-weening conceit of their own Spiritual Gifts&mdash;the &s;trength of their FAITH, and the ar|dor of their HOPE, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us&mdash;made that a plea for lording it over their brethren; and for Spiritual Pride, ra&s;h Condemnation, and cen&s;orious contempt of others; con|tending that tho&s;e endowed with &s;uperior Gifts and Ac|qui&s;itions, were as the Head, Heart, and Vital parts of the Body, while others were as the meaner Members.</P>
<P>SAINT Paul attacks them on their own Principles; and, by a beautiful Allu&s;ion to the Body Natural, proves that Chri&s;tians of lower attainments, were as much members of Chri&s;t's My&s;tical body, as tho&s;e of the highe&s;t; and that to condemn or judge uncharitably of them, was as much a Schi&s;m in the Body My&s;tical, as if in the Body Natural, <Q>the Foot &s;hould &s;ay, becau&s;e I am not the Hand; and the Ear, becau&s;e I am not the Eye&mdash;that therefore, they are not of the Body. For if the whole were an Eye, where were the Hearing? If the whole were Hearing, where were the Smelling?</Q></P>
<P>JUST &s;o in the Body My&s;tical. <Q>Are all Apo&s;tles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers? are all Workers of Mi|racles? Have all the Gifts of Healing? Do all &s;peak with Tongues? Do all Interpret?</Q></P>

<P>HE then begins his divine Sermon on CHARITY; and &s;urely, my Brethren, he could not have delivered him&s;elf with a more glorious and fervent Zeal, had he lived to &s;ee tho&s;e fiercer Contentions, that Havock and De&s;truction, which the want of this Go&s;pel-virtue of CHARITY hath introduced into modern times&mdash;that Spirit of Bitterne&s;s and Violence; that Thir&s;t of Imperiou&s;ne&s;s and Dominion; that pre&s;umptuous Cen&s;ure and religious Railing; that Strife for modes and opinions, une&s;&s;ential to Chri&s;tianity; that De&s;ire of obtruding our own di&s;tingui&s;hing Tenets on tho&s;e around us, rather than the common Commandments of CHRIST; that Earne&s;tne&s;s of Compelling their FAITH, ra|ther than provoking their LOVE and OBEDIENCE by our good example&mdash;all which unchri&s;tian Temper hath been, like the worm at the root of Jonah's Gourd, eating out the very Vitals of Religion; and hath often made this world more like an Aceldama, or field of Blood, than the peace|ful Heritage of the meek and lowly Je&s;us. For mo&s;t cer|tain it is, from &s;ad experience, that when once this Temper begins to prevail, not only the LOVE OF GOD is forgotten, but along with it the LOVE OF OUR NEIGHBOURS al&s;o; and the Heart, by Habits of Bitterne&s;s, Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, Con|tention, Violence and Revenge, becomes gradually call us, and dead to all the &s;ofter impre&s;&s;ions of Humanity, Mercy and Good-will.</P>

<P>FOR Eloquence, employed to puff up the vanity of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and not exerted, in the &s;pirit of Love and Truth, to propagate Univer&s;al Holine&s;s, "is but as the &s;ounding Bra&s;s, and tinkling Cymbal."</P>

<P>WOULD we truly know the Apo&s;tle's di&s;tinction on this head, methinks it may be rendered obvious in a few words, however needle&s;ly perplexed it hath been.</P>
<P>FAITH and HOPE with him are indeed ever made the foundations of true RELIGION. But LOVE is the &s;uper|&s;tructure; or it is Religion it&s;elf, in all its perfection and glory. FAITH, in his comprehen&s;ive language, is the <Q>Sub&s;tance of Things Hoped for, the Evidence of Things not &s;een</Q>&mdash;That is to &s;ay&mdash;a &s;trong Belief in the ador|able Perfections of God, and in the worth and reality of Invi&s;ible things&mdash;a Belief that as his Veracity hath never failed us in the Pa&s;t, &s;o neither will it fail in the Accom|pli&s;hment of tho&s;e glorious Future Things which he hath promi&s;ed, altho' they may be too high and mighty for our pre&s;ent Comprehen&s;ion. And thus tho&s;e future Invi&s;ible things become Evidenced to us, and pre&s;ented before us, as if already enjoyed in Sub&s;tance and Reality; leading us to lay hold of Chri&s;t as offered to us in the go&s;pel; all which is connected with, or nece&s;&s;arily productive of, the next divine grace and virtue, &s;tiled by our Apo&s;tle HOPE, or "the HOPE of Righteou&s;ne&s;s by FAITH"&mdash;a firm and joyous Confidence, that our &s;incere, tho' imperfect, Ser|vices will be accepted thro' Him, in&s;tead of that un&s;inning Obedience required by the &s;trict tenor of the Law; and that we &s;hall be Ju&s;tified, Sanctified, and finally Saved by coming to God, in this <HI>"new and living way."</HI></P>
<P>NOW, can &s;uch Views of God's Goodne&s;s as the&s;e, be without LOVE? Or would the&s;e views be of any u&s;e at all, but for leading us to that LOVE, which begets Obedience and Conformity to what is &s;o Lovely and Venerable?</P>

<P>UNDER the Law, remarkable was the attention paid to the STRANGER, the FATHERLESS, and the WIDOW. <Q>When thou cutte&s;t down thine Harve&s;t, and ha&s;t forgot|ten a Sheaf in the field, thou &s;halt not go to fetch it&mdash; it &s;hall be for the STRANGER, the FATHERLESS, and the WIDOW&mdash;when thou beate&s;t thine Olive-tree, thou &s;halt not go over the boughs again&mdash;when thou gather|e&s;t the Grapes of thy Vineyard, thou &s;halt not glean it

<P>EVEN David, altho' he re&s;i&s;ted his own natural affec|tions, and continued inexorable to the recal of a favourite Son, who had offended him, yet could not with&s;tand tho&s;e mournful accents of the WIDOW of Tekoah&mdash;<Q>Help. O King&mdash;I am indeed a WIDOW-WOMAN, and my Hu&s;|band is Dead</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>THE &s;tory is truly tender, tho' feigned. And if this WIDOW's Apparent Di&s;tre&s;s could procure an oath of Da|vid, that a hair of her &s;on (who&s;e life was forfeited to the public) &s;hould not fall to the ground, only by pleading, that if this &s;on was lo&s;t, <Q>her coal, which was alive, would be quenched, and neither name nor remainder be left to her hu&s;band on earth</Q>&mdash;I &s;ay, if this &s;tory of Feigned Di&s;tre&s;s could &s;o far prevail, &s;urely the voice of Real Di&s;tre&s;s will have a &s;till greater influence&mdash;the voice of WIDOWS indeed! not pleading for lives forfeited to the law, but for Them&s;elves, and their Children&mdash;for the Names and Remainders of your own Clergy, that they may not be wholly lo&s;t upon earth&mdash;the Names and Remain|ders of men, who have once been your dear Friends in CHRIST-JESUS; men who, in their life-time, have admini&s;tered to you heavenly Coun&s;el, and &s;weet Comfort, in his precious Word and Covenant; and men who may have often opened your Souls to flow in tho&s;e godlike &s;treams of Benevolence and Charity to others, wherewith tho&s;e Helple&s;s Remainders of them&s;elves now &s;tand in need to be relieved and refre&s;hed at your hands.</P>
<P>MANY words are not needful to explain the nature and propriety of &s;uch a Charity as this, nor need I mention the long Call there hath been for its e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>YOU well know the &s;ituation and circum&s;tances of the Clergy of the Church of England, in the&s;e Northern Co|lonies;
<PB N="28" REF="011469_0027_0F83302CDEC6CCA8">
for the Relief of who&s;e families, when left in di|&s;tre&s;s, this de&s;ign is more particularly &s;et on foot. Except in a few places, their chief &s;upport depends on the Bounty of our fellow-members of the Church in Great-Britain; and that venerable Society, who have the Di&s;tribution of this bounty, have of late been obliged, and will be &s;till more obliged, to retrench their allowance; that, like faith|ful Stewards, they may be likewi&s;e able to reach out their helping hand to tho&s;e numerous Petitioners for New Mi&s;|&s;ions, which ari&s;e from the con&s;tant encrea&s;e of People in the&s;e Colonies.</P>
<P>THE additional Support which our Clergy receive from their Congregations, is generally &s;mall, and exceedingly precarious; decrea&s;ing &s;ometimes in Nominal, often in Real value; while the expence of every Nece&s;&s;ary in life is proportionably encrea&s;ing.</P>
<P>DECENCY, a regard to Character, to their own U&s;eful|ne&s;s, to the credit of Religion, and even your Credit, among whom they mini&s;ter, require them to maintain &s;ome &s;ort of Figure in their families, above tho&s;e in common profe&s;&s;ions and bu&s;ine&s;s; while, certain it is, on the other hand, that any &s;ober reputable Trade&s;man, can turn his In|du&s;try to more account than They.</P>
<P>THE like regard to Decency and character al&s;o forbids our Clergy to follow any Secular employ, in aid of their circum&s;tances; unle&s;s, perhaps, here and there one, by Education, &s;hould have been qualified for &s;ome Practice in the Healing Art of Medicine, which is not deemed incom|patible with the Pa&s;toral duty, where it is not too large.</P>
<P>ON the whole, this I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that were the generality of our Clergy to make their calculation according to the way of the world, the money <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The money expended this way can &s;carce be e&s;timated at much le&s;s than &pound; 500 &s;terling, and many of our mi&s;&s;ionary clergy do not receive &pound; 30 &s;terling per annum from their congregations, &s;ome not more than half that &s;um, and not a great number much above it.</NOTE> expended in their education at Schools and Colleges, a Voyage for Holy Or|ders,
<PB N="29" REF="011469_0028_0F83302DA4531A50">
and the purcha&s;e of nece&s;&s;ary books (if it had been laid out at fir&s;t as a common Capital at Intere&s;t) would bring them a greater annual return, without any trouble or fa|tigue, either of Body or Mind, than they can procure by the labour of their whole lives, in di&s;charge of their pa&s;toral duty, exclu&s;ive of the Bounty of benevolent per&s;ons in the mother country.</P>
<P>I AM far from mentioning the&s;e things as Complaints; I know they are of Nece&s;&s;ity in many places; and I tru&s;t none of my brethren among the Clergy will ever make their Cal|culation in this way; but keep their Eye on their MASTER's Service, looking forward to the "Recompence of Reward." Yet what I mention is &s;o far nece&s;&s;ary, as it &s;hews inconte&s;ti|bly the great propriety of the de&s;ign before us.</P>
<P>IT certainly requires little attention to what pa&s;&s;es around us, to &s;ee that the families of our decea&s;ed Clergy are often left among the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in their vicinity. The Fa|ther, by &s;trict oeconomy, and good Example, may be able to &s;upport them in &s;ome degree of Reputation, during his own Life, altho' not to flatter them with the hopes of any Patrimony at his death. By his own Care, and &s;ome con|veniency of Schools, he may give the Sons the rudiments of an Education for his own profe&s;&s;ion, or &s;ome other u&s;eful one in the world. The Mother, with the like anxious Care, and fond Hopes of rendering the Daughters re&s;pect|able among their Sex, may employ her late and early toil to train their Minds to tho&s;e virtues, and their Hands to that Diligence and Indu&s;try, which might one day make them the &s;weet accompli&s;hed companions of worthy men in do|me&s;tic life.&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT alas! amid&s;t all the&s;e flattering dreams and fond pre|&s;ages of the heart, the Father, perhaps in his prime of years and u&s;efulne&s;s, is called from this world. The Prop and Stay of all this promi&s;ing Family is now no more! His Life was their whole dependence, under God, even for daily

Bread! His Death leaves them almo&s;t de&s;titute&mdash;de&s;titute, alas! not of Bread only, but even of Council and Protec|tion upon earth!</P>
<P>FATAL rever&s;e&mdash;Ah! little do the world in general, and e&s;pecially they who ba&s;k in the ea&s;y &s;un&s;hine of afflu|ence and pro&s;perity&mdash;little do they know the various com|plicated &s;cenes of private angui&s;h and di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;Here they are various and complicated indeed!</P>
<P>THE Bereaved and Di&s;con&s;olate MOTHER, as &s;oon as Chri&s;tian Reflection begins to dry up her tears a little, finds them wrung from her afre&s;h by the melancholy Ta&s;k that re|mains to her. She is now, alas! to reduce the once flatter|ing hopes of her tender Family, to the &s;tandard of their pre&s;ent &s;ad and humbled condition! Hard Ta&s;k indeed! The Son is to be told that he mu&s;t no more a&s;pire to reach the &s;tation which his Father filled; and the Daughter is to learn that, in this hard and &s;elfi&s;h world, &s;he mu&s;t no longer ex|pect to become the Wife of him, to whom &s;he once might have looked on terms of equality&mdash;The Son, perhaps, mu&s;t de&s;cend to &s;ome Manual employ, while even the poor pit|tance nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ettle him in That, is not to be found; and the Daughter mu&s;t &s;erve &s;trangers, or be yoked perhaps in Marriage for Mere Bread; while the mournful mother (without the &s;low-procured help of Friends) can &s;carce fur|ni&s;h out the decent Wedding-garment!</P>
<P>WHAT did I &s;ay? the decent Wedding-garment, and a Marriage for Mere Bread? This were an I&s;&s;ue of troubles devoutly to be wi&s;hed for!&mdash;But, ah me! The Snares of POVERTY in a Mind once bred up above it&mdash;&s;hall every unguarded unprotected Female be able to e&s;cape them? Alas! no&mdash;Some VILLAIN-DECEIVER, with Vows and broken Oaths, with LOVE in his Mouth, and HELL in his Heart, taking advantage of Innocence in Di&s;tre&s;s, lays his &s;cheme of de&s;truction &s;ure; and with the ruin of the Daugh|ter,

<P>JUST, but indignant, Heaven! Is there no cho&s;en Ven|geance in this World, to heap on the heads of &s;uch per|fidious mon&s;ters, to SAVE them from that Vengeance, which they have merited, tho' yet we dare not wi&s;h them, in the World to come!</P>
<P>THIS &s;ad part of the Cata&s;trophe of many Females, de|&s;cended from fathers, once venerable and pious in their day, we would willingly have pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence; were not the experience of what has happened in other countries, more than &s;ufficient to awaken our apprehen&s;ions in this.</P>
<P>THE picture here drawn, is no exaggerated one; and when the Children of Clergy, in low circum&s;tances, are in an early age deprived of both Parents&mdash;then are they OR|PHANS indeed! and every di&s;tre&s;s, every temptation, falls upon them, with aggravated weight!</P>
<P>TO be FATHERS, then, to &s;uch FATHERLESS CHIL|DREN; to take them by the hand, and lead them out, thro' the &s;nares of the world, into &s;ome public U&s;efulne&s;s in life, that the Name and Memorial of our dear Brethren and faith|ful Pa&s;tors decea&s;ed, may not be wholly lo&s;t upon earth&mdash; I &s;ay, to DO THIS, and give &s;ome Gleams of comfort to the afflicted WIDOWS and MOTHERS that &s;urvive&mdash;mu&s;t &s;urely be one of the mo&s;t delightful Actions of a BENEVO|LENT Mind; and THIS, my brethren, is the glorious ob|ject of the CHARITY for which we are Incorporated, and which we have undertaken to &s;ollicit and conduct.</P>
<P>BLESSED, therefore, be all they in this world and the next (Laity and Clergy) into who&s;e Hearts God hath put it, to a&s;&s;ociate for &s;o noble and pious a purpo&s;e. In like man|ner, may that venerable Society in England be ble&s;&s;ed, who&s;e annual Sub&s;cription hath laid &s;o liberal a Foundation for the work; and ble&s;&s;ed al&s;o be tho&s;e Governors of Provinces,

who have &s;o cheerfully and readily given us their Charters for carrying it into execution!</P>
<P>HAPPY in &s;uch Beginnings and &s;uch Countenance, let us &s;et our&s;elves earne&s;tly to the di&s;charge of our Part; leav|ing the I&s;&s;ue to GOD, and the Benevolence of good Men.</P>
<P>SOME <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have rea&s;on to think that &s;uch per&s;ons are far from a majority of any deno|mination. Many of all per&s;ua&s;ions have expre&s;&s;ed their hearty wi&s;hes for the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the de&s;ign; and I am particularly bound to acknowledge the ready a&s;&s;i&s;tance received from a worthy friend of mine, who had a principal &s;hare in framing the plan for the relief of the widows and children of Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters; and who communicated to me not only &s;everal u&s;eful papers, but likewi&s;e whatever remarks he thought might enable us to improve our Plan, on the experience of any diffi|culties or deficiencies that had occurred in the execution of theirs.</NOTE>, perhaps, there may be, long accu&s;tomed to view every Tran&s;action of our Church on this Continent with a jealous eye, and who being loudly tenacious of every pri|vilege of their own, tho' &s;paring in their allowance to o|thers&mdash;may therefore conceive more to be Intended by this undertaking than is Expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>TO &s;uch, however, if it may have any weight with them, I will declare, that altho' every thing relative to this de&s;ign from the beginning has pa&s;&s;ed thro' my own hands, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a few others, appointed for that purpo&s;e, I have never known the lea&s;t hint or thought of any thing further ex|pected from the execution of it, than what our charters expre&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT &s;hould it have all that happy Effect to us which &s;ome may apprehend from it, namely&mdash;that of producing a more intimate Connexion and UNION among our Clergy and Church-members; &s;urely it is what we ought mo&s;t ardent|ly to de&s;ire and pur&s;ue, at this time e&s;pecially.</P>
<P>WHEN we &s;ee our Church and Mini&s;try unrea&s;onably oppo&s;ed, and borne down in their common and e&s;&s;ential rights; when we behold men &s;eemingly Leaguing together to perpetuate this oppo&s;ition from Father to Son; it can cer|tainly be no Harm in us, but our bounden Duty, to look to our own Concerns al&s;o; and particularly to take &s;ome
<PB N="33" REF="011469_0032_0F833030A9922E70">
Thought, that our Children be not left wholly De&s;titute in a world where We, and They on our account, are likely to meet with &s;o little favour from many&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT my &s;ubject is CHARITY&mdash;I would not violate that &s;ubject; and I ble&s;s God that it hath not been violated, on our part, on this trying occa&s;ion; and that our general con|duct hath been &s;uch, as not to di&s;credit the long-approved Moderation of that Church to which we belong.</P>
<P>IN the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s and &s;ober argument, firm, but (we hope) decent, our endeavour hath been to &s;hew&mdash;That the Fears and Jealou&s;ies mu&s;tered up concerning us, could have no po&s;&s;ible Foundation, without a total Abolition of the whole &s;y&s;tem of Law and Policy in the&s;e Colonies; that the Contingency which could render &s;uch an Abolition po&s;|&s;ible, is as unlikely to happen as any thing that can well be imagined in this world; and that therefore, on the whole, it re&s;ts with the Con&s;ciences of our opponents them&s;elves, to reconcile their own conduct to any principles of BRO|THERLY LOVE and CHARITY, or to any other principles whatever, not bordering on Intolerancy of Spirit, and an undue lu&s;t of Dominion on their own part.</P>
<P>SO far, we may felicitate our&s;elves. And if to have act|ed thus can be thought a breach of CHARITY, we mu&s;t reply, that there is a CHARITY to Truth and Right, &s;u|perior to all others. We have now but one &s;tep further, my brethren, to &s;ecure a Conque&s;t, equally compleat and glo|rious&mdash;Let us, in the continuance of every act of Mode|ration, Love and Well-doing, be a LIVING ANSWER to Gain&s;ayers; and the time may yet come, when, every other Strife being &s;u&s;pended, we &s;hall all be &s;o mollified one to another, &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Spirit of Go&s;pel-Love, that we &s;hall think it our mutual Honor, as it is our mutual Duty, to mix our whole endeavours in the Propagation of our Common Chri&s;tianity, only &s;triving who&s;e Zeal &s;hall be fore|mo&s;t&mdash;nay, and even to mix our Deeds of Charity to

the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, they with us, and we with them, as God &s;hall give us abilities, without regard to Sect or Party.</P>
<P>HAPPY time, &s;hould it ever take place! For then would Men indeed FEEL a Truth, now little attended to; and which I wi&s;h I could write in letters legible to the whole Univer&s;e&mdash;"That there is a greater Weight and Moment of CHRISTIANITY, in one Deed of Benevolence, where we have the Power to do Good, or in one Sigh for Di&s;tre&s;s, where we have not the power (proceeding from a heart that is right towards God, and towards man) than in all the doubtful Points of Controver&s;y, all the Oppo&s;ition to Modes and Forms, that have bu&s;ied and enflamed the world ever &s;ince the REFORMATION&mdash;and which will never de&s;erve the true name of a REFORMATION, till this foul Reproach is wiped away from it al&s;o!"</P>
<P>BUT till that happy time arrives, it is to tho&s;e of our own Communion we mu&s;t chiefly look, for the &s;ucce&s;s of the pious Charity before us. Humane and benevolent as they are known to be in all ca&s;es of Di&s;tre&s;s, the FATHER|LESS and WIDOWS of their own Clergy will never be with|out Advocates and Benefactors among them.</P>
<P>THE particular Rules by which this Charity is to be con|ducted are open to all; and the main &s;upport of the Fund is to be the annual Sub&s;criptions of the Clergy them&s;elves, with &s;uch ca&s;ual Benefactions as, by the Providence of GOD, may be added to it.</P>
<P>IF Succe&s;s &s;hould, in any Degree, be an&s;werable to our hopes and wi&s;hes, it will &s;urely be a high Satisfaction to the members of our Churches, to behold their Mini&s;ters &s;o relieved from tho&s;e anxious cares, which every man mu&s;t have on the pro&s;pect of leaving a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Family behind him, as to proceed cheerfully in all Duty; knowing, that altho' they can acquire little, and leave le&s;s of their own in this world, there is &s;ome &s;mall provi&s;ion to place their
<PB N="35" REF="011469_0034_0F833032297192C8">
children above total want, and &s;ome Protectors and Friends to guard their Infant-years.</P>
<P>BUT a &s;till higher Satisfaction will ari&s;e at the la&s;t Day, to all who have participated in &s;uch LABOURS OF LOVE&mdash;to hear tho&s;e whom their Benevolence hath relieved, te&s;tify|ing for them before their ALMIGHTY JUDGE&mdash;or rather to hear their ALMIGHTY JUDGE him&s;elf te&s;tifying in the name of tho&s;e relieved De&s;titutes, and embracing them with the following glorious &s;entence&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>COME, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father! inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>FOR I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; thir&s;ty, and ye gave me drink; a &s;tranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; &s;ick, and ye vi&s;ited me; in pri&s;on, and ye came unto me.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>THAT all of us may be &s;o Habituated to acts of Mercy and Love in the pre&s;ent world, as to be found fit for this happy &s;entence in the next, may GOD, of his infinite Mer|cy, grant thro' JESUS CHRIST! Amen.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="011469_0035_0F833032EA9F3588">AFTER the conclu&s;ion of the foregoing SERMON, a ve|ry generous collection was made at the Church-doors for the benefit of the Charity, as will appear by the annexed li&s;t of donations. And the members of the corporation, having continued in church till the congregation was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, proceeded from thence to pre&s;ent an addre&s;s of thanks to the honourable Governor PENN, for his Grant of a Charter; reque&s;ting that their thanks might, in like man|ner, be tran&s;mitted, thro' him, to the honourable Proprie|taries of the province, THOMAS PENN, and RICHARD PENN, E&s;quires, for the hearty approbation they had given of the de&s;ign; to all which his Honour was plea&s;ed to return a very affectionate an&s;wer, expre&s;&s;ive of his readine&s;s, at all times, to &s;erve the intere&s;t of the Church of England in general, and this Charity in particular.</P>

The &s;ame zeal would have been manife&s;t|ed by the re&s;pectable Lay-members re&s;iding at New-York, notwith&s;tanding their great di&s;tance, if their pre&s;ence had been ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.
