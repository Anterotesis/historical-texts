<HEAD>&rindx; The fir&s;t BOOK of the American Chronicles of the Times. CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>AND behold! when the tidings came to the great city that is afar off, the city that is in the land of Britain, how the men of Bo&s;ton, even the Bo&s;tonites, had aro&s;e, a great multitude, and de&s;troyed the TEA, the abominable merchandize of the ea&s;t, and ca&s;t it into the mid&s;t of the &s;ea:</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Lord the King waxed exceeding wroth, in&s;omuch that the form of his vi&s;age was changed, and his knees &s;mote one again&s;t the other.</P>
<P N="3">3. Then he a&s;&s;embled together the Princes, the Nobles, the Coun&s;ellors, the Judges, and all the Rulers of the people, even the great Sanhedrim, and when he had told them what things were come to pa&s;s,</P>
<P N="4">4. They &s;mote their brea&s;ts and &s;aid, The&s;e men fear thee not, O King, neither have they obeyed the voice of our Lord the King, nor wor&s;hipped the TEA CHEST, which thou ha&s;t &s;et up, who&s;e length was three cubits, and the breadth thereof one cubit and an half.</P>
<P N="5">5. Now therefore make a decree that their har|bours be blocked up, and ports &s;hut, that their mer|chants may be broke, and their multitudes peri&s;h, that there may be no more the voice of merchandize heard in the land, that their &s;hips that goeth upon the wa|ters, may be &s;unk in the depths thereof, and their mariners dwindle away to nought, that their cods and
<PB REF="013105_0002_0F8EC53D05A35FE8">
their oil may &s;tink, and the whale, the great Levia|than, may be no more troubled, for that they have re|belled again&s;t thee.</P>
<P N="6">6. And it came to pa&s;s that the king hearkened unto the voice of the&s;e &s;ons of Belial.</P>
<P N="7">7. Then aro&s;e Mordecai, the Benjamite, who was four &s;core and five years old, an aged man whom the Lord loved, a wi&s;e man, a &s;ooth&s;ayer, an a&s;trologer, in whom was wi&s;dom from above, and he &s;aid unto the King, I pray thee, O King, let thy &s;ervant &s;peak.</P>
<P N="8">8. And the King commanded that he &s;hould &s;peak.</P>
<P N="9">9. Then Mordecai &s;pake aloud, in the pre&s;ence of all the Princes, the Nobles, the Coun&s;ellors, the Judges, and the Rulers of the people, and &s;aid, O King, live for ever.</P>
<P N="10">10. Thy throne, O King, is encompa&s;&s;ed about with lies, and thy &s;ervants, the Bernardites and the Hutchin&s;onians, are full of deceit, for be it known unto thee, O King, they hide the truth from thee, and wrongfully accu&s;e the men of Bo&s;ton, for behold, the&s;e letters in mine hand witne&s;&s;eth &s;ore again&s;t them; O King, if thou art wi&s;e, thou wilt under|&s;tand the&s;e things.</P>
<P N="11">11. And there was pre&s;ent one of the King's Coun&s;ellors, a Jacobite, a vagabond, a Wedderbur|nite, and he u&s;ed &s;oul language, and &s;aid unto Morde|cai, Thou lie&s;t; and Mordecai an&s;wered and &s;aid unto him, God will &s;mite thee, thou whited wall, and Mordecai departed from among&s;t them.</P>
<P N="12">12. And behold the Princes, the Nobles, the Coun&s;ellors, the Judges, and all the Rulers of the people, cried out vehemently again&s;t Mordecai, for they were in fear becau&s;e of Mordecai's wi&s;dom.</P>
<P N="13">13. And they be&s;ought the King that he would take from Mordecai his po&s;t, for he was in high ho|nour before that time.</P>
<P N="14">14. So they prevailed on the King, and he took from Mordecai his po&s;t and all that he had, and Mor|decai was per&s;ecured yet more and more, but he bore it patiently&punc; for Job was his grandfather's great grand|father; moreover, he knew the times mu&s;t alter, and the King's eyes would be opened anon.</P>
<P N="15"><PB REF="013105_0003_0F8EBA6EC68EB600">15. Now in the &s;eventh month, in the fourteenth day of the month, the Lord the King commanded Thomas, the captain of the Gageites, &s;aying,</P>
<P N="16">16. Choo&s;e thou the valiant men of Britain, by hundreds and by thou&s;ands, and get ye together the &s;hips, even the &s;hips of war, the terror of the nations round about, and make your way towards the coa&s;ts of the Americanites, the land of the Bo&s;tonians, that lieth on the other &s;ide of the &s;ea we&s;twards, and cut off all that pi&s;&s;eth again&s;t the wall, and utterly de|&s;troy all their cities with fire and with &s;word, for they have rebelled again&s;t me.</P>
<P N="17">17. Howbeit, the men of Bo&s;ton had intelligence thereof, for they kept their &s;pies abroad from the ea&s;t to the we&s;t, and from the north to the &s;outh; and when the tidings came of the&s;e things, they rent their clothes, and fa&s;ted, put on &s;ackcloth, and went &s;oftly.</P>
<P N="18">18. And the Bo&s;tonites, the men of New-Eng|land, &s;pake unto Jedediah, the &s;cribe, that he would bring the book of the law of their fathers, which the Lord had commanded they &s;hould obey.</P>
<P N="19">19. Then Jedediah, the prie&s;t, brought the book of the law before the congregation, both of men and women that could under&s;tand it.</P>
<P N="20">20. And he read therein in the &s;treet that was be|fore the Water-gate, and in the Market-place, and at the entry of the Fi&s;h-gate, and in the Old-South, from the morning until the mid-day, and from the mid-day until the evening.</P>
<P N="21">21. For Jedediah the prie&s;t had under&s;tanding of the times to know what the Americanites ought to do, and what they ought not to do, and all his bre|theren were at his commandment.</P>
<P N="22">22. And the ears of all the people hearkened unto the book of the law, and entered into a &s;olemn league and covenant, that they would obey the book of the law, and none other, both the prie&s;ts and the Levites.</P>
<P N="23">23. And behold when Thomas, the Gageite, was come into the land of the Bo&s;tonites, he threatned them &s;ore, and &s;wore by the life of Pharaoh, in&s;o|much that &s;ome of the old women and children lift|ed up their voices, and wept exceedingly with bitter lamentations.</P>
<P N="24"><PB REF="013105_0004_0F8EC5410684A7C8">24. And it came to pa&s;s that the New-Yorkites, the Philadelphites, the Marylandites, the Virginites, the Carolinites, took pity on their brethren the Bo&s;|tonites, for there was like to be a famine in the land.</P>
<P N="25">25. And they got ready their camels and their a&s;&s;es, their mules and their oxen, and laded them with their meat, their fine wheaten flour, their rice, their corn, their beeves and their &s;heep, and their figs and their rai&s;ins, and their wine and their oil, and their tobacco abundantly, and &s;ix thou&s;and &s;hekels of &s;il|ver, and three&s;core talents of gold, and &s;ent them by the hands of the Levites, to their brethren, and there was joy in the land.</P>
<P N="26">26. Now this &s;ame Thomas, a Heathen, put forth a mock proclamation for the encouragement of piety.</P>
<P N="27">27. Then Jedediah the prie&s;t, and Obadiah, and Ezekiel, and Jonathan the &s;on of Ebenezer, &s;tood up and &s;aid, Men and brethren (the Lord knoweth our hearts, and that we fear the Lord) ye have &s;een how this Heathen maketh a mock of holy things, and pro|faneth the GOD of our fathers, this man is like unto a Phari&s;ee, he prayeth with his windows open, and a two edged &s;word at our throats. Moreover, he defi|leth the &s;abbath, in that he traineth his men on the Lord's-day, and have ye not &s;een with your eyes how he &s;toppeth the way &s;ide, that the congregation may not pa&s;s, and how that he putteth the yoke of cannon upon the neck of the Bo&s;tonites, and the people mar|velled and &s;aid, Fye upon thee, Thomas! fye upon thee, Thomas! The Lord will avenge him&s;elf of &s;uch abominations.</P>
<P N="28">28. Now be of good comfort, let us &s;end me&s;&s;en|gers into all the coa&s;ts of our brethren the America|nites, peradventure they will commune with us, for we be one people, and &s;erve one God: If &s;o be they hear us, the Lord is on our &s;ide; but if they refu&s;e to hearken unto us, they and we be then &s;laves to the Gageites, and our &s;ub&s;tance and all that we have, taken from us, and we be their hewers of wood and drawers of water.</P>
<P N="29">29. And all the people &s;houted, and &s;aid with one voice, Send and commune with our brethren.</P>
<P N="30"><PB REF="013105_0005_0F8EC541E12532F0">30. Now it came to pa&s;s that their brethren li&s;t|ened unto them, and they &s;ent me&s;&s;engers backwards and forwards throughout the land, from the ea&s;t un|to the we&s;t, and from the north unto the &s;outh, even unto the &s;ea coa&s;t of the Georgeites.</P>
<P N="31">31. And they a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves together, in a Congre&s;s in the great city of Philadelphia, in the hou&s;e of the Carpenters, the builders hou&s;e, in the land of Penn&s;ylvania, on the &s;eventh day of the ninth month, with their coaches, their chariots, their camels, their hor&s;emen and their &s;ervants, a great multitude, and they communed together.</P>
<P N="32">32. And behold while they thus communed, cer|tain Torykites, fal&s;e prophets, and friends to the Gageites, &s;aid, Let us di&s;tract their coun&s;els, and &s;et at nought their Congre&s;s, we will cau&s;e a lying &s;pirit to go throughout their land, that the great city of the Bo&s;tonites is burned to the ground, and the inhabi|tants thereof are &s;lain by the edge of the &s;word, per|adventure they will return home to inquire after their wives, their little ones, and their &s;heep and their oxen, and we be then rewarded by our Lord the King.</P>
<P N="33">33. And the rumour thereof &s;pread abroad thro'|out all the land, and me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent day by day.</P>
<P N="34">34. And moreover, that Thomas the Gageite, the Captain of the Heathen, came by night and &s;tole away their powder, and their implements of war, and to &s;eize their brethren and &s;end them away captives to Babel, to be tried by the Heathen laws, and per|adventure hanged for &s;uppo&s;ed tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P N="35">35. Then aro&s;e Jedediah the prie&s;t, and Amina|dab, and Obadiah, and Jeremiah, and lifted up their voices, and &s;pake aloud and &s;aid,</P>
<P N="36">36. Fathers, brethren, and the children of our fathers, ye have heard of all the evil that has been brought upon our city, the city of our forefathers, the New-Canaan, the land of Promi&s;e, and behold this day it is de&s;olate, and no man dwelleth therein.</P>
<P N="37">37. How doth the city remain &s;olitary that was full of people; &s;he is as a widow: She that was great among&s;t the nations, and prince&s;s among the provinces, is about to be made tributary, and bow down to the TEA CHEST, the God of the
<PB REF="013105_0006_0F8EC543255991B8">
Heathen; tell it not in Gath, nor publi&s;h it in the &s;treets of A&s;kalon.</P>
<P N="38">38. Now therefore, if it &s;eemeth good unto you, and that it proceedeth of the Lord our GOD, we will &s;end to and fro unto our brethren that are in all the land of the Americanites (for with them are Prie&s;ts and Levites in the cities and &s;uburbs thereof) that they may a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves unto us.</P>
<P N="39">39. And all the congregation an&s;wered and &s;aid, Let us do &s;o, for the thing &s;eemeth good in the eyes of all the people, for &s;urely they will not be like the Gibeonites of Old.</P>
<P N="40">40. And they yet &s;pake unto them and &s;aid, Now, therefore, we pray ye ari&s;e! every man of you from &s;ixteen to &s;ixty get up, be &s;trong and valiant, gird thy &s;word upon thy thigh, O thou mo&s;t mighty, are ye not the men, and are ye not the &s;ons of your fa|thers, that &s;ubdued the Loui&s;burgites?</P>
<P N="41">41. And the young men gave a great &s;hout and &s;aid, Yea, verily, we have heard with our ears, and our fathers have declared unto us, the noble deeds which they did in your days, and in the Old times before us.</P>
<P N="42">42. And Jedediah the prie&s;t, and Aminadab, and Obadiah, yet &s;pake once more to the people and &s;aid, Moreover brethren, are ye not valiant men, and &s;prang from the tribes of the Oliverians, be not a|fraid, nor di&s;mayed, the Lord is on our &s;ide, we fight the battles of the Lord, let us drive the heathen out of our land, for they are but as gra&s;hoppers unto us, and all the congregation gave a mighty &s;hout and &s;aid, lead us on; and Caleb and his brethren, ten men in number, were &s;ent as &s;pies.</P>
<P N="43">43. And they cau&s;ed me&s;&s;engers to go through|out all the land, from Framingham to Salem, and from Salem to Seabrook, and from Seabrook to Ply|mouth, and from Plymouth to Nantucket, and from Nantucket to Marblehead, and from Marblehead throughout Connecticut, and from Connecticut thro'|out all the cities, and along the &s;ea coa&s;ts, and the borders thereof, and the valiant men a&s;&s;embled them|&s;elves, and marched to the relief of the men of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P N="44"><PB REF="013105_0007_0F8EC5442370DC58">44. The Captains of hundreds, and the Captains of thou&s;ands, and all the people from the lea&s;t even to the greate&s;t, came to fight the battles of the Lord.</P>
<P N="45">45. And the tribes of the valiant men from the mountains, and from the country afar back, and as thou goe&s;t down to the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and they pitched their tents, which were of the &s;kins of lions, and of bears, and of wolves, and of foxes, and of he-goats, and encamped in the valley of Ephraim.</P>
<P N="46">46. And the&s;e are the names of the tribes, and the number of them that were &s;ealed (that is, that had &s;worn by the &s;olemn league and covenant) the lea&s;t of of whom could re&s;i&s;t an hundred, and the greate&s;t a thou&s;and, valiant men of war, and apt for battle, which could handle a &s;pear and &s;hield, and their faces were like the faces of lions, and who&s;e feet were like the roes in the mountains in &s;wiftne&s;s.</P>
<P N="47">47. Of the tribe of Aminadab and Jedediah the prie&s;t, that were &s;ealed, which were reckoned by their geneologies, &s;eventeen thou&s;and and &s;even hundred and ninety and two, who&s;e &s;taves were like unto white Oak &s;aplins.</P>
<P N="48">48. Of the tribe of Obadiah that were &s;ealed, &s;ix thou&s;and and four hundred and &s;eventy and two, and their &s;ons, and their &s;ons &s;ons, that could handle the the &s;trong bow and javelin.</P>
<P N="49">49. Of the tribe of Ezekiel that were &s;ealed, four thou&s;and and four hundred and &s;ixty and &s;ix, who&s;e fi&s;ts were as the hoofs of an elephant, and could beat down the Colo&s;&s;us at Rhodes.</P>
<P N="50">50. Of the tribe of I&s;rael and Jonathan, the &s;ons of Ebenezer, that were &s;ealed, ten thou&s;and and &s;ix hundred and forty and nine that could &s;ling a &s;tone to a hair's breadth.</P>
<P N="51">51. Of the tribe of Nathan, and Eleazer, and Ruben and Hezekiah, and Caleb, which were &s;eal|ed, forty thou&s;and and three hundred and four&s;core and nineteen, five heads of the hou&s;hold of their fa|thers, all cho&s;en men, and men of valour from their youth, exceeding Goliah of Gath in height.</P>
<P N="52">52. Of the tribe of Peletiah and Zedekiah, which were &s;ealed, five thou&s;and and &s;ix hundred four&s;core
<PB REF="013105_0008_0F8EC5446A22C9F8">
and one, the lea&s;t of whom were &s;tronger than Samp|&s;on, bold men, and as hard as a pine knot.</P>
<P N="53">53. Of the tribe of Zechariah, the &s;on of Jo&s;hua, which were &s;ealed, twenty thou&s;and and three hundred thirty and one, men of high renown, which have done mighty feats.</P>
<P N="54">54. Now the&s;e are the names and the numbers of their tribes.</P>
<P N="55">55. Now it came to pa&s;s that when the Gageites beheld them afar off on their way, even as the &s;and on the &s;ea &s;hore in number, with their &s;lings, and their darts, and their cro&s;s bows, and their &s;pears, and their javelins in their hands, that they were a&s;toni&s;hed, and fear came upon them, and they &s;aid one to ano|ther, Let us flee to our own country afar off, for the&s;e be not men, but unconquerable Devils.</P>
<P N="56">56. Howbeit, while the Gageites were about to flee, the &s;pies returned and &s;pake to the Bo&s;tonites, as they were on their way (for each man marched a &s;tep with a gigantic &s;tride of three cubits and a half, and a &s;pan) and &s;aid, Behold, brethren, your city, the city of our forefathers, even the city of our GOD, is &s;afe, and your brethren, your wives, and your little ones, your cattle and your &s;heep are all in health, for the heathen have not de&s;troyed them.</P>
<P N="57">57. So the rumour cea&s;ed, and the people gave a &s;hout, a mighty &s;hout, which was heard even in the camp of the Heathen afar off, and they &s;aid, who dare to &s;pread this rumour, behold! are there not TAR and FEATHERS enough in our land for the&s;e di&s;|turbers of our quiet.</P>
<P N="58">58. And the men departed every man to his own home in peace, and the prie&s;ts returned and ble&s;&s;ed the LORD.</P>
<P N="59">59. Now the re&s;t of the acts of the Gageites, and all that they did, fir&s;t and la&s;t, and all their a|bominations, behold will they not written in the book of the Lamentations of the Elders and Select Men of Bo&s;ton.</P>
