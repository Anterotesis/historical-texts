<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INTENDING not to trouble you with an Apology, or any thing Ceremonious, I thought fit in this place ju&s;t to hint to you the Contents of the following Treati&s;e, and the Motives inducing me to &s;uch a Perfor|mance; and al&s;o a little to Open and Expo&s;e the Doctrines of Quakeri&s;m at lea&s;t to give you &s;uch a General View thereof, as perhaps may con&s;iderably facilitate your Under&s;tanding their particular Tenets, as they occur in the Place and Order in which they are di&s;po&s;ed in the Second Chapter, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t of all,</HI> I have given you an Hone&s;t and True Account of my own Ca&s;e, and of that Wonderful and Peculiar Providence of GOD, which was Concerned for me therein; In which, youd find many things worthy of your Notice, tending to your Profit, and Strongly engaging your Acknowlegements of the Finger of GOD, which I hope is Sincerely my chief End in giving you the Narrative thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="002696_0004_0FE60BBAB855C0C0"><HI>In the next Place,</HI> I have given yon the main Heals of the <HI>New-London Quakeri&s;m</HI> an Here&s;ie Advanced and Maintained there by <HI>John Rogers,</HI> Late of that Town, Decea&s;ed, and to this Day adhered to by many Per&s;ons thereabout.</P>
<P>Together with which I have drawn the prin|cipal Lines of the true Portraiture of proper <HI>Quakeri&s;m,</HI> both Ancient and Modern.</P>
<P>Mr De&s;ign herein, is to Remove the mi&s;takes &amp; Con&s;equently the Dangers which I fear many may be in. Who not imagining what Errors the&s;e People hold, or what Truths in Religion they Deny and Oppo&s;e, may have conceived a favourable Opinion of them &amp; their ways, who neverthele&s;s may by the bare view of tho&s;e <HI>Here&s;ies,</HI> be induced to alter their opinions about them, for they &s;o directly Contradict both <HI>Re|ligion</HI> &amp; all <HI>Right Rea&s;on,</HI> as that the very opening and Expo&s;ing, will ordinarily prove an Effectual Confutation of them.</P>
<P><HI>In the third place,</HI> I have &s;poken &s;omething in an&s;wer to <HI>John Rogers</HI>'s Boa&s;tings of his Suffer|ing In which I have indeavoured to &s;hew the Criminal Cau&s;es of tho&s;e Sufferings; by which it is manife&s;t, that his Gloryings were Extremely Vain, and that he had no cau&s;e to boa&s;t, except that becau&s;e his Puni&s;hments were Lighter than his Crimes.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;t of all,</HI> I have concluded with a word of Advice to &s;uch as are already taken in that Snare.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="002696_0004_0FE60BBAB855C0C0">Now as to <HI>Quakeri&s;m</HI> in General, I conceive of is to be nothing el&s;e but &s;ome of the Here&s;ies of <HI>Pelagius</HI> (Improved) who lived about <HI>Anno,</HI> 415 and held among&s;t other Error, <HI>that Chri&s;t Dyed for all men,</HI> viz as much for one man as an other. To &s;upport which Error 'twas nece&s;&s;ary to advance the doctrine of <HI>Free-will,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to the truth of <HI>Election and Free Grace</HI> (thence came all our free wi&s;ers) For he that holds the Univer&s;ality of Chri&s;ts Death, can no way &s;alve the divine Ju&s;tice in Damning &s;ome, but by Sup|po&s;ing a full power in all to Reject or take Benefit by his Death of themelves.</P>
<P>The&s;e Errors of <HI>Pelagius</HI> have been ever &s;ince kept up and believed in whole or in part, 'till a few Years ago, <HI>viz.</HI> about or near the middle of the la&s;t Century, that one <HI>George Fox,</HI> came upon the Stage, who was the fir&s;t proper <HI>Quaker</HI> that the world hath &s;een, he held the Univer&s;a|lity of Chri&s;ts Death, and built upon it; he was &s;oon followed by Multitudes, &s;ome of whom rather out went him and became very eminent &amp; Superior Guides of their Sect, who were called <HI>Quakers,</HI> becau&s;e of an horried &s;haking that would &s;urpri&s;e their Bodies, e&s;pecially when their Souls were in Exta&s;ies, which frequently happened.</P>
<P>They held that JESUS the son of <HI>Mary,</HI> &amp;c' was not the Chri&s;t, in any other &s;en&s;e then every Saint is, that he is not the Saviour of Sinners, that he Died for his Religion, but Merited nothing by it for any but Him&s;elf But that Chri&s;t the Son of God and Saviour of Sinners is
<PB N="iv" REF="002696_0005_0FE60BBCC75FC970">
a part of the <HI>Divine E&s;&s;ence,</HI> which is &s;hed forth into the Hearts of all both <HI>Good and Bad,</HI> and is a <HI>Light</HI> unto all, but a <HI>Guide and Saviour</HI> to them that will Submit thereto as &s;uch.</P>
<P>That <HI>Chri&s;ts coming in the Fle&s;h</HI> is the Entrance of this piece of the <HI>Divine E&s;&s;ence</HI> into the fle&s;h of men, that his Manife&s;tation in the fle&s;h &s;igni|fies the apparent Exerting his <HI>Divine power in men,</HI> that His offering Him&s;elf a Sacrifice to God is &s;omething done by Him in a mans body for the Pacifying the Wrath of God.</P>
<P>That <HI>His Suffering and Dying</HI> on <HI>the Cro&s;s,</HI> the <HI>Brui&s;ing His Body</HI> and <HI>Shedding His Blood,</HI> mu&s;t be taken only in a <HI>Spiritual Sen&s;e.</HI> Now all this they held to be done for <HI>Every Man</HI> in his own Body by the afore&s;aid peice of the proper E&s;&s;ence of God, which they mo&s;t frequently &s;tiled the <HI>Light within.</HI> And &s;o they are to be under&s;tood when they &s;ay, that <HI>the Death of Chri&s;t</HI> is Uni|ver&s;al, or that <HI>He Dyed for all men.</HI></P>
<P>They al&s;o held the Doctrine of <HI>Free Will;</HI> and a&s;&s;erted that Every Man had a <HI>Full Power</HI> in him&s;elf to follow the Dictates of the <HI>Light within,</HI> or to <HI>Di&s;obey</HI> them, and in ca&s;e of Di&s;obedience they held that this <HI>&V;niver&s;al Light</HI> would after a while give over playing the Saviour with a man, and turn to be a <HI>Spirit of Horror</HI> and A|&s;toni&s;hment in him; &amp; this they called <HI>Hell,</HI> but to the <HI>Willing and Obedient</HI> it would be their <HI>God and Saviour;</HI> it would procure them pardon of <HI>Pa&s;t Sins</HI> and keep them from Committing <HI>Future ones,</HI> it would perfectly Illuminate and
<PB N="v" REF="002696_0005_0FE60BBCC75FC970">
Sanctify them and make them Equal with <HI>God Him&s;elf.</HI> (As to this Equality, &s;ee <HI>Francis Howgills works,</HI> Page 232.) Hence the <HI>Quakers</HI> Rejected all <HI>Revealed Religion,</HI> Damned the <HI>Bible, &amp;c.</HI> and gave them&s;elves up to walk Intirely by the <HI>Light within.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Tenets being &s;o Extremely <HI>Non&s;en&s;ical</HI> &amp; <HI>Bla&s;phemous,</HI> few men of knowledge have been taken in the &s;hare, yet &s;ome there have been, Particularly one <HI>Barclay,</HI> a Learned &amp; Ingenuous <HI>Scotchman,</HI> who preached in the Time of <HI>King Charles the Second,</HI> He &s;oon perceived that <HI>Qua|keri&s;m</HI> needed Emendation and Poli&s;hing, which he E&s;&s;ayed to do in a Book called <HI>Propo&s;itions of Divinity,</HI> in which he expre&s;&s;es quite Different sentiments about many things, from what the <HI>Former Quakers</HI> had done, but yet Remained a <HI>Quaker:</HI> for both &s;pake from the &s;ame Infallible Guide, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Light within,</HI> &amp; yet they Differed even about the very Light it &s;elf: For as I &s;aid before the former held it to be <HI>God;</HI> and as I might have &s;aid, they accounted it to be <HI>the Soul of Man. Barclay</HI> &s;ays, <HI>'Tis neither of the Two,</HI> but a <HI>Certain Divine Sub&s;tance</HI> Different <HI>from Both;</HI> He &s;ays, it's <HI>Palpable, &amp;c.</HI> and that God is wrap'd up in it, and Can't be &s;eperated from it, he calls it the <HI>Vehicle of God,</HI> the <HI>Spiritual Body of Chri&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Bread which comes down from Heaven,</HI> the <HI>Spirit,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> the <HI>Word,</HI> the <HI>Seed,</HI> the <HI>Life,</HI> the <HI>Light,</HI> the <HI>Grace;</HI> a minute afterwards he makes it an <HI>Eatable sub&s;tance,</HI> and &s;ays, That <HI>Good men do Eat and Drink its Blood,</HI> and that he calls the
<PB N="vi" REF="002696_0006_0FE60BBCDA224AD8">
<HI>Communion of the Body and Blood of Chri&s;t,</HI> he &s;ays 'tis he <HI>Saviour of Sinners,</HI> yet he acknowleges Chri&s;t too tho'in a Remote way, for he &s;ays that Chri&s;t by his &s;ufferings purcha&s;ed <HI>the Light within,</HI> which is Properly and Immediately the Saviour. <HI>Barclay</HI> al&s;o minced the Doctrine of Free-will, for he held the power of mans Will to be only <HI>Negative</HI> and that it did not Extend to the performance of any <HI>Po&s;itive act of Obedience,</HI> but only that man by the power of his will might forbear to Re&s;i&s;t the Motions of the Light &amp; might yield &amp; &s;ubmit him&s;ef to the o|perations of it; &amp; in ca&s;e a man did &s;o, then the Light would &s;upply him with &s;trength to do what&s;oever it Commanded to be done by him.</P>
<P>It Remains that I &s;peak of the third &s;tep in Quakeri&s;m taken by <HI>John Rogers,</HI> who Received his fir&s;t Notions of Spirituality from <HI>Banks,</HI> &amp; <HI>Ca&s;e,</HI> a couple of Lewd men of that &s;ort called <HI>Singing Quakers,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Noi&s;yne&s;s</HI> acquired them that appellation to Di&s;tingui&s;h them from o|ther <HI>Quakers,</HI> from whom they differ not in Doctrine</P>
<P>The&s;e men as they <HI>Danced through this Colony,</HI> (Attended by an herd of <HI>Women</HI> who &s;aid of them, that their Lips dropped <HI>Myrrh &amp;c.</HI>) Lit of <HI>John Rogers</HI> and made a <HI>Quaker</HI> of him: But neither they nor the Spirit could teach him to &s;ing; God not having given him a <HI>Mu&s;ical ear,</HI> nor <HI>Tuneable Voice,</HI> which was a Torment to him: However he Remained their Di&s;ciple for
<PB N="vii" REF="002696_0006_0FE60BBCDA224AD8">
a while, and then being wi&s;er than his Teachers made a Tran&s;ition to the Church of the <HI>Seventh Day Bapti&s;ts;</HI> But the &s;ame Spirit not de&s;erting him but &s;etting in with the di&s;po&s;ition of his own Spirit, to a Vehement affectation of <HI>Prece|dency,</HI> he Re&s;olved to Reach it, though it &s;hould happen to Lead to <HI>Singularity;</HI> whereupon after a few <HI>Revelations,</HI> he Re&s;olved upon Quakeri&s;m again, though under a Modification &s;omewhat new, I call it Quakeri&s;m, not but that he differ|ed from them in many things, yet holding with them in the main; being Guided by the <HI>&s;ame Spirit,</HI> acknowleging their <HI>Spirit,</HI> and they his; he mu&s;t needs be called <HI>a Quaker.</HI></P>
<P>'Twere well if the Con&s;ideration of mans <HI>Pronene&s;s to Err,</HI> from the <HI>Dreadful In&s;tances</HI> of it in &s;piritual things, might Effectually Excite every one to Endeavour Sea&s;onably to have their <HI>Hearts</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>with Grace.</HI></P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved, that there are certain Times which pa&s;s over &s;ome men, in which they are in mo re mminent danger of departing from the Faith, giving heed to <HI>Seducing Spirits.</HI></P>
<P>One is the Time of <HI>&s;ore Affliction;</HI> when a man through the mere Providence of God, is under very <HI>Afflictive Circum&s;tances;</HI> then he will be Tempted to Di&s;content and Repining at Gods Providence; which if he don't Watch and Pray again&s;t, but &s;uffers it to grow upon him, 'Tis well if the next &s;tep be not to <HI>change his Religion.</HI> We know the <HI>Jews</HI> under Dark and Afflictive Providences Murmured and Fell to <HI>Idolatry.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="002696_0007_0FE60BCD1824A618">Another time is when a man has <HI>Suffered very unju&s;t Treatment from men,</HI> as he conceives; and having, applyed to the Authority for Relief, but not obtaining it, hell be Tempted to think Uncharitably of, and Rail again&s;t them, which if he allows him elf to do, his next Temptation will be to <HI>fall away to &s;ome Party that Oppo&s;es them:</HI> And this was the ca&s;e of one <HI>Gates</HI> in <HI>New-Lon|don</HI>-County.</P>
<P>The Third and La&s;t that I will note is the Time <HI>of Spiritual Conviction,</HI> when a &s;en&s;e of Guil has wounded the Soul, the Terrors of the Lord Inviron him on every &s;ide. Satan pur&s;ues him with all his <HI>Fiery Darts,</HI> and Chri&s;t is not yet revealed to him; he ll go from <HI>Mountain to Hill,</HI> and be in danger to hearken to the voice of every one that &s;hall &s;ay to him, <HI>Lo, here is Chri&s;t,</HI> or <HI>Lo, there.</HI> And to be led away by <HI>every wind of Doctrine</HI> This was <HI>my ca&s;e:</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Giving an Account of the <HI>Authors</HI> being Led into, and <HI>His</HI> Recovery from <HI>Quakeri&s;m.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MY near Alliance to <HI>John Rogers,</HI> (then <HI>Junior</HI>) who is my Brother, <HI>viz.</HI> the Son of <HI>my Mother,</HI> Proved an Unhappy Snare to me. He being Naturally a Man as Manly, Wi&s;e, Facetious, and Generous, perhaps as one among&s;t a Thou&s;and; I was exceedingly De|lighted in and with his Conver&s;ation: He al&s;o Indeared him&s;elf to me very much, by his Repeated Expre&s;&s;ions of Complacency in me; by which I was Induced to be Frequently in his Company, and often at his Hou&s;e, where his Father would be Entertaining of me with Exhortations to a <HI>Religious Life;</HI> Warning me of the <HI>Danger of Sin,</HI> &amp; Certainty of <HI>that Wrath</HI> which &s;hall come on all that Know not GOD, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I would &s;ome times for Curio&s;ity be enquiring into <HI>his Principles,</HI> and other times for Diver&s;ion, be Di&s;puting a Point with him; but I knew not <HI>that the Dead were there, Prov.</HI> 7.24 I was not <HI>Religious enough</HI> to be much concerned about his Principles, but <HI>Pitiful enough</HI> to be extreamly
<PB N="2" REF="002696_0008_0FE60BCD283EE6F8">
moved with the Story of his Sufferings, who had a Faculty to Relate them very Artfully in his <HI>own Favour.</HI> Until at length my Mind came to be In&s;en&s;ibly tinged with &s;omething of Pre|judice again&s;t <HI>both Magi&s;trates</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ters.</HI> I had al&s;o a Re&s;erve in <HI>his Favour,</HI> that 'twas Po&s;&s;ible, he might be a Good Man (the &s;trang|ne&s;s of his Doctrines notwith&s;tanding) e&s;peci|ally &s;eeing all his Sufferings were not Able to &s;hake his Con&s;tancy, or Oblige him to Recede from the lea&s;t part of his Religion.</P>
<P>At length <HI>my Brother</HI> became a very Strict and Devout Profe&s;&s;or of his Fathers Religion, and &s;o became le&s;s Sociable, till at length our Con|ver&s;ation was almo&s;t wholly Su&s;pended for di|vers Years.</P>
<P>When &s;ome Years and many Changes had roll'd over me, it Plea&s;ed GOD in a Solitary Moment to bring into my thoughts, the&s;e Words, <HI>For&s;ake the Fooli&s;h &amp; Live,</HI> I wondred at the Words, their &s;ound and &s;avour was like the Word of GOD, but I remained &s;ome Days at a lo&s;s about them. However I dwelt upon them, and they afforded me con&s;tant <HI>matter of Meditation.</HI> I under&s;tood them to Sugge&s;t that if I would <HI>Live Eternally,</HI> I mu&s;t For&s;ake <HI>my Sins,</HI> which the Scrip|ture calls <HI>Folly,</HI> and my <HI>Vain Companions,</HI> which the Scripture calls <HI>Fools.</HI> Thus they Ingro&s;&s;ed almo&s;t all my tho'ts for &s;everal Days, till by &s;earch I found them <HI>In the Ninth of Proverbs at the Sixth Ver&s;e:</HI> where the Sen&s;e Compleat is, <HI>For&s;ake the Fooli&s;h and Live, and go in the way of</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="002696_0008_0FE60BCD283EE6F8">
<HI>&V;nder&s;tanding.</HI> Whereupon I Concluded there was &s;omething of God's more than <HI>Common Pro|vidence</HI> in the bringing tho&s;e Words into my Mind, or at lea&s;t in the Application of them thereto; I took them as a Reproof of my <HI>Vain Cour&s;e of Life,</HI> and a Coun&s;el and Invitation to me <HI>to Walk with the Wi&s;e</HI> and be Wi&s;e. Where|upon I fully Re&s;olved from thence-forth to Turn from Sin to GOD, which I thought not <HI>Extreme Difficult</HI> to do, &s;eeing my Under&s;tanding was now fully Per&s;waded of the Nece&s;&s;ity of it, in Order to Life and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P>Accordingly I began to &s;et up a Strict and Religious Cour&s;e of Life, to Reform the <HI>Errors of my Ways,</HI> to <HI>Pray to GOD in Secret,</HI> and to <HI>Attend the Means of Grace,</HI> expecting that GOD would &s;oon meet me in his ways, and An&s;wer me with <HI>Strength in my Soul.</HI> After &s;ome Tryal made, I found it far otherwi&s;e, I could Experi|ence no &s;en&s;ible Supplys from God, but &s;eemed to Labour wholly in my own Strength. I found I could neither <HI>Believe, Repent</HI> nor <HI>Reform</HI> to any Good Effect, nor Per&s;evere in my Good Purpo&s;es &s;o Lately and Solemnly Re&s;olved upon This made me add to my Prayers <HI>Fa&s;ting,</HI> to <HI>Renew</HI> my <HI>Re&s;olutions,</HI> and to put forth <HI>more Strength,</HI> to Maintain a Stricter Watch over my Heart &amp; Life, but &s;till all <HI>&s;eemed in Vain,</HI> I was never the nearer to GOD by all that I could do; and &s;o perhaps for about Seven Months I was in a &s;trange Perplexity, I knew not what to do, nor was I Able to do any thing; &s;ometimes I &s;hould

be very much Concerned and Re&s;olute, at other times very Dull and Indifferent, &amp; at other times ready to give over all through Di&s;couragement. At length upon con&s;idering tho&s;e Words, Gen. 6.3. <HI>My Spirit &s;hall not always Strive with Man,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>I had but a little pa&s;&s;ed this Temptation, but I began to be very Impatient that GOD had not Revealed Chri&s;t to me, and &s;hewed me the way of Faith. At Length I began to Que&s;tion, whither I had not been &s;eeking <HI>the Living among the Dead;</HI> I thought it Unu&s;ual for God &s;o long to withold the Knowlege of Him&s;elf &amp; Ways from any &s;o Solicitous to have Known Him; whereupon I feared I had been in the way of an <HI>Erroneous and Heterodox Religion,</HI> I Re&s;olved to Examine it, and did &s;o; but nei|ther Methodically, Impartially, nor Effectually.</P>

<P>As for tho&s;e few whom I Judged to be Sin|cere, I thought it might be as &s;ome had &s;aid, that &s;ome of every Religion are Saved, &amp; &s;o I thought never the better of the way for their Sakes.</P>
<P>In the next place, I con&s;idered the <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> with whom I &s;oon found fault for their Salaries, I thought they might Labour with their Hands, and Preach the Word by an extraordinary A&s;|&s;i&s;tance, as the Apo&s;tles did, if they were the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t; and thus on a &s;udden be|fore I was aware, I became deeply Prejudiced again&s;t <HI>both Mini&s;ters and People</HI> before ever I had examined the Articles of Faith, &s;o <HI>Fooli&s;h was I &amp; Ignorant even as a Bea&s;t before thee,</HI> P&s;al 73.22.</P>

<P>In this Drunken Staggering Condition, I began to be Lead or rather Driven <HI>Head-long</HI> a very great pace in the greate&s;t imaginable Confu&s;ion, and no le&s;s Perplexity, the whole frame of Re|ligion was Tottering and ready to fall with me, yet I could not tell why, &s;ave that, in the general it looked all wrong, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>There was nothing now worthy of Remark that I Experienced for &s;ome Weeks, &s;ave only that I remained in <HI>a Confu&s;ed, Un&s;etled Po&s;ture,</HI> Doubtful of everything, and fixed in nothing but my Re&s;olutions to <HI>Pray always,</HI> and to Act according to the be&s;t Light I had, which by this time was very <HI>gro&s;s Darkne&s;s;</HI> for a Spirit of In|fatuation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my Under&s;tanding, &s;o that in Spiritual things I was not able to Act as a Man; I grew &s;o Prejudiced again&s;t the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> as that I could &s;carce bear to hear Mr. <HI>Noyes</HI> Preach, at length on a Saturday being about the beginning of <HI>January,</HI> 1709 10.

<P>Now by the way, I would Ob&s;erve to you, that until <HI>I Wrote to my Brother,</HI> I had not hinted a word of <HI>my Scruples</HI> about matters of Religion to the Deare&s;t Friend in the World; through a certain Aver&s;ation from my very Childhood to Con&s;ult the wi&s;e&s;t or be&s;t Friend in Ca&s;es of <HI>Extreme Difficulty,</HI> though in <HI>lighter Troubles</HI> I could do it freely; which is an Unhappy Di&s;|advantage I Labour under to this Day.</P>

<P>Now you may Plea&s;e to Under&s;tand that by this time, there had been perhaps u&s;ed with me, all proper means of Conviction, but in Vain; my Prejudices increa&s;ed to that pitch, as that I could hardly talk Peaceably with a <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> and all but &s;uch I De&s;pi&s;ed as <HI>Mean, Ignorant,</HI> and <HI>Bigotted per&s;ons,</HI> that held their Principles (and Con&s;ciences too) of their <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> excepting a very few at whom Captain <HI>Huntington</HI> was one, whom I accounted a Man of Knowlege, &amp; I allowed he might have <HI>Grace,</HI> who being &s;ent

<P>The Twenty Sixth of <HI>January,</HI> refu&s;ing to pay a Fine, or to &s;uffer any to do it for me, I was carried to Pri&s;on at <HI>New-London,</HI> for Pro|phanation of the <HI>Sabbath la&s;t</HI> before.</P>

On the Fifth Day of my Con|&s;inement, my Wife again&s;t my expre&s;s Prohi|bition having Paid the Fine, and Procured a Mandamus to the Goaler to Di&s;charge me, the Me&s;&s;enger came in the Morning: This was Surprizing and Unwelcome News to me, for
<PB N="18" REF="002696_0016_0FE60BE2D9CE4320">
that Morning I had awaked in a Marvellous Calm, every thing was Plea&s;ant &amp; Ea&s;ie to me; I could Believe and Conclude any thing in my own Favour without any Premi&s;&s;es at all: and it &s;eemed to me the more Spiritual way, &amp; indeed the only way of the Spirit, and now I hoped all would be well; among&s;t other things I had a De&s;ire to be <HI>Baptized</HI> by <HI>John Rogers;</HI> tho&s;e words in <HI>Act.</HI> 22.16. ran much in my mind, <HI>And now why tarrie&s;t thou? ari&s;e, and be baptized, and wa&s;h away thy &s;ins,</HI> &amp;c. And accordingly was Bapti&s;ed of him as &s;oon as Relea&s;ed from Pri&s;on, by bury|ing my Body in the Water: after which I went home, it being Tue&s;day. The Re&s;idue of that Week I walked in Darkne&s;s and deep Di&s;tre&s;s, for as I was <HI>without Light</HI> &s;o I was <HI>without Comfort.</HI> The next Sabbath <HI>John Rogers</HI> and his Company, held a meeting at my Hou&s;e, and he Preached and Prayed there.

All that Spirituality I had &s;ome times found in that way, and they had talked &s;o much of, was now clean Evani&s;hed, and an Horrour of <HI>thick Darkne&s;s</HI> re&s;ted on me, and &s;o I &s;pent mo&s;t of the en&s;uing Week, yet the Darkne&s;s was not unto De&s;pair.

did in their Clo&s;ets, or e&s;pecially what was done by a Day of Prayer Privately kept on my account by &s;ome of the Church that Week; upon whom its &s;aid there was an Extraordinary &amp; Undenia|ble Spirit of Prayer poured forth, at length I forced my &s;elf to a Con&s;ideration of things, and finally thus Re&s;olved, <HI>viz.</HI> That in as much as this Newly Embraced Religion &s;eemed at the pre&s;ent the more Probable way wherein to find Chri&s;t and Peace, I would by no means Decline, &s;eeking after him therein, at lea&s;t till I had bet|ter Light; yet withal that I would more &s;trict|ly pry into it, and take nothing upon tru&s;t from Men, &amp; accordingly I Prepared &s;undry <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> for <HI>John Rogers</HI> his Solution at the next Meeting, which happened at his Hou&s;e the next Sabbath, where I mentioned the&s;e Three, De&s;iring to know what was to be Believed, in the Premi&s;&s;es, and al&s;o from what Scripture Grounds;</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 1. <HI>Whether the &V;nion between Chri&s;t and a Beliver be the &s;ame with what is of the Two Na|tures of Chri&s;t,</HI> viz <HI>a Per&s;onal &V;nion?</HI></P>
<P>Que&s;t. 2. <HI>Whether the Sufferings of Chri&s;t in His Followers,</HI> viz. <HI>In the Bodies of the Saints, be of equal Value and Merit, with tho&s;e he Suffered in His Own Per&s;on, according to their Kind and Degree.</HI></P>
<P>Que&s;t. 3. <HI>Whether an Eternal Decree of GOD had Determined the Salvation of tho&s;e we call the Elect?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="002696_0017_0FE60BE615458E80">I &s;oon Perceived the Queries were very un|expected to every one; however there was a very Profound Silence and Attention in the A&s;&s;embly, Whil&s;t he with all po&s;&s;ible wilyne&s;s, as it were, Confounded the Three Que&s;tions together and then there was no Que&s;tion in it: So that a pro|per An&s;wer was both Needle&s;s and impo&s;&s;ible: and then he went On quoting a multitude of Scriptures, and heaping up Words but with ut|mo&s;t Confu&s;ion, and of no Pertinency or Signi|ficancy to my purpo&s;e, until no Mortal <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> have gue&s;&s;ed at his Opinion about the matters, or have known by his An&s;wer what the Que&s;ti|ons were, nor &s;carcely to what Science they be|longed.</P>
<P>After this, he ended his Di&s;cour&s;e with a Flouri&s;h to this Effect, viz. <HI>Thou doe&s;t well to &s;eek Light,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but thou our bre&s;t to Con&s;ider that thou art but a Babe in Chri&s;t, and &s;ee&s;t Men but as Trees, and maye&s;t &s;oon Di&s;advantage thy &s;elf by too Curious an Inqui&s;uivene&s;s into deep Matters of Faith; thou had&s;t better be Content to Believe and Walk by what Light thou art Capable of, till by Rea&s;on of &V;&s;e thou &s;halt be able to Dige&s;t &s;trong Meat: for my own part it was once with me as tis now with thee, but now its otherwi&s;e for the&s;e and &s;uch like Wonderful My&s;teries, are now all &s;o Plain and Ea&s;ie to me, as that I do not De&s;ire a better Knowlege of them than what I have, for I can &s;ee.

<HI>unmovable and &s;tedfa&s;t in thy Sufferings for Chri&s;t.</HI> I was Confounded at his Talk, for indeed I think no Man would have looked for &s;uch an An&s;wer from a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t; I &s;aid not much upon it, but Determined to &s;can it in time convenient: And accordingly when I came Home, having Earne&s;tly begged A&s;&s;i&s;tance of GOD, to make ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Reflections upon it, I began &amp; con&s;idered <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> the Que&s;ti|ons, and the <HI>two fir&s;t</HI> of them I judged to be very nece&s;&s;ary to be well under&s;tood, in order to the being of a right Faith: as to the <HI>Third,</HI> I judged it a point of great concern, to be under|&s;tood by every Chri&s;tian; and all Three of the Que&s;tions to Re&s;pect nothing but Revealed Truth.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I con&s;idered my &s;elf, and although I had as low thoughts of my Ability to Di&s;cern Spiritual things in a Spiritual Manner, as any one could have had of me; yet when I con|&s;idered the Maturity of my Years, and that from a Child I had had &s;ome Knowlege of the Scrip|tures, and withal that my under&s;tanding was not De&s;picable, I judged my &s;elf capable of a Doctrinal Knowlege of any Revealed Truth; and how any &s;uch Knowlege &s;hould endanger my Spiritual Intere&s;t I could not conceive, for it is Written, that <HI>without Knowlege the mind can't be good.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>La&s;t Place</HI> I con&s;idered the Re&s;pondent <HI>John Rogers</HI> and his An&s;wer, and thought I, if he be a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, and if he be Guided by GOD's Spirit, and e&s;pecially if in an extraor|dinary
<PB N="22" REF="002696_0018_0FE60BE627923BD8">
and Infallible Manner, as he Profe&s;&s;es, then he has been giving me a rea&s;on of the Hope that is in him with Meekne&s;s and Fear, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3, 15. and has been feeding me with the Bread of Knowlege, For what Chri&s;t &s;ays to <HI>Peter,</HI> Joh. 21.15, 16 <HI>Feed my Lambs,</HI> is no le&s;s Requi|red of every Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t. But I could not take his An&s;wer by any means under &s;uch a Con&s;truction, without utterly excluding my Rea|&s;on, according to which it was plain that he Indu&s;triou&s;ly Concealed from me his own Senti|ments, and Laboured with much Craftine&s;s to divert me from further &s;earches after any Solid Knowlege in the matters propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I Remember as I came home from that meet|ting, I Rode part of the way with one of the Company, who &s;aid thus to me, <HI>viz. why, Thee was't upon &s;ome very high Queries with</HI> John.</P>
<P>I An&s;wered him to this Effect, that all mat|ters of Faith were high Things.

<P>But to Return, I Dwelt upon the&s;e Reflections &s;everal Days, and it plea&s;ed GOD to Re&s;train by Degrees, that Spirit of Prejudice whereby I was Bla&s;&s;ed again&s;t the Truth, &s;o that I was able to think more Indifferently and to Argue

more Regularly about Things, which I thought to be my Duty and Intere&s;t to Improve, and accordingly I pre&s;&s;ed forward with all po&s;&s;ible Endeavours to try all things.</P>
<P>I was quickly brought to a &s;tand about <HI>my Mini&s;ter;</HI> but my affections were &s;o &s;trongly towards him that I could not ea&s;ily Conclude again&s;t him, al&s;o the further progre&s;s I made in Tryal of his Doctrines the more I Scrupled them, my Scruples Increa&s;ed to Doubts, till I had Little to &s;ay for the defence of the mo&s;t of them, at Length I was afraid any Longer to Adhere to them, yet at pre&s;ent far from a good Opinion of the true Religion; but began to be able with &s;ome degree of Calmne&s;s, to Confer with others about Principles which laid me under great Advantage for Conviction, till at Length I came to be pretty well Satisfied that the A&s;&s;emblies Catechi&s;m, in the General, was Orthodox, yet &s;till I Doubted of &s;ome things in it, particularly <HI>the Doctrine of Election;</HI> I could not bear that an Irrevocable Decree of GOD &s;hould have Determined that, whil&s;t it Remain|ed &s;o very Doubtful with me concerning my Self, till I perceived the main difficulty with me was touching my own Election; and that as to the Doctrine in general, I was not able to with|&s;tand the Truth of it.</P>
<P>I began now to have &s;ad tho'ts of my Late Deviation from the Truth, &amp; at the end of three Weeks made <HI>a Publick Recantation,</HI> which the Church accepting, Received Me into their Charity.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="002696_0019_0FE60BF31C31D5A0">And thus it plea&s;ed GOD to bring me intire|ly off from my adherence to that Faction, and their Errors; and that Principally without the force of arguments from Mini&s;ters or Books, for I could Conver&s;e but Little with them, but rather as the Prophet &s;ays, Zec. 4 6 <HI>Not by Might nor by Power, but by my Spirit &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</HI> Still after all there Remained Heavy upon me the Guilt of Sin and great Darkne&s;s and Uncertainty about my Spiritual E&s;tate, I Trem|bled at the tho'ts of tho&s;e Mi&s;erable <HI>Jews</HI> who Peri&s;hed in the Wilderne&s;s through the ju&s;t Wrath of GOD, after their Deliverance from <HI>Egypt,</HI> and never &s;aw the <HI>Good Land.</HI> I read Mr <HI>Guthery</HI> about the <HI>Tryal of a Saving Interest in Chri&s;t:</HI> And Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI>'s <HI>Sincere Convert,</HI> with other Books to the &s;ame Effect, and Diver&s;e times had almo&s;t Concluded in my own Favour, but <HI>Shepard</HI> was &s;o exceedingly &s;earching, that he &s;hewed me from time to time, my deceits of Heart, Mi&s;takes, Pre&s;umptions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;o broke me off from every hold, drave me from every re&s;ting place, and brought me many a time to my Wits end.</P>

&s;eemed to Argue my Reprobation. The&s;e deep Di&s;couragements were al&s;o Accompany'd with the Blacke&s;t Temptations, through the force whereof I was ready to envy the Salvation of others. This Startled me, as what carried in it the expre&s;s Image of Satan I Cryed to God for Pardon and Strength; and thus I pa&s;&s;ed many Weeks, till Providentially reading the Thirty Fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>Jeremiah</HI> &amp; the Third Ver&s;e, <HI>I have Loved thee with an Everla&s;ting Love: there|fore with Loving Kindne&s;s have I drawn thee.</HI> At the fir&s;t view I was ready to have taken the Words for a full Proof of my Election, but &s;oon call'd to mind how I u&s;ed to be Impo&s;ed upon, and that it concerned me to try every thing &amp; take nothing unrea&s;onably. However the Words brought with them a <HI>Sweet Influence,</HI> and were more excellent than to be lightly pa&s;|&s;ed over, I read them again and again, but was for &s;ome time at a lo&s;s how to Improve them. By <HI>Everla&s;ting Love,</HI> I under&s;tood <HI>GOD's Eternal Electing Love,</HI> and by <HI>Drawing,</HI> &amp;c I under&s;tood <HI>Effectual Calling:</HI> Hereupon I Propounded to my &s;elf two <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> from the Words, Fir&s;t, <HI>Have I been the Subject of Loving Kindne&s;s?</HI> And if &s;o, then Secondly, <HI>Have I been drawn thereby?</HI> For if I can Affirm the&s;e two, I mu&s;t thence ln|fer my Election.</P>
<P>Then taking a &s;trict Survey of things, I &s;aw to my great Comfort, that I had Experienced abundance of Favours from the Hand of GOD, whereof divers had been Extraordinary great,
<PB N="26" REF="002696_0020_0FE60BF327B19F00">
and e&s;pecially my late Wonderful Inlargement from the Chains of Error. Such Reflections made me look again on the words to <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> which appeared now with another A&s;pect: I con&s;idered that the mo&s;t High, had <HI>Wonders of Mercy,</HI> as well as <HI>of Judgment</HI> to &s;hew, and 'twas po&s;&s;ible his De&s;igns concerning me were to &s;hew <HI>the Wonders of Free Grace.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Second Que&s;tion</HI> al&s;o I re&s;olved in the Affir|mative, for I found my Heart to be Sen&s;ibly drawn to Love, Fear, Acknowlege &amp; Wor&s;hip GOD for all his Benefits: but yet whether I were Saving|ly and Effectually drawn I was at a lo&s;s, and &s;o Concluded nothing as to the Point of Election; but &s;till the Sweet Impre&s;&s;ion of the Words Re|mained a long time; whereby I was Supported and Carryed on with &s;ome Chearfulne&s;s, till by a Sermon of Mr. <HI>Noyes,</HI> I was ca&s;t down to the Du&s;t; in which Sermon, he &s;hewed from tho&s;e Words, Prov. 23.7. <HI>As he thinketh in his Heart, &s;o is he:</HI> That a Mans E&s;tate might be known to him <HI>by the &s;etled bent &amp; Inclination of his Heart,</HI> &amp;c Which put me upon &s;earching my Heart; by which I di&s;covered nothing that Evidenced to my Satisfaction any real Change, I found it very much &s;et upon Earthly things, Corrupti|ons very &s;trong &amp; Unmortified. And although I Earne&s;tly de&s;ired to e&s;cape Eternal Death, yet could not at that time Perceive any real Graci|ous Actings or Di&s;po&s;itions of my Soul towards GOD. Hereupon I was very Di&s;con&s;olate, my Patience was now almo&s;t at an end, and I feared
<PB N="27" REF="002696_0020_0FE60BF327B19F00">
GOD's would be quite, &amp; his Spirit would cea&s;e to &s;trive with me: And thus it was with me &s;ome time, till it Plea&s;ed the Lord to Refre&s;h my expiring Hopes, by that good Promi&s;e to <HI>Jacob,</HI> Gen. 18.15. <HI>And behold I am with thee, and will keep thee &mdash;For I wil not leave thee, till I have done that which I have &s;poken to thee of.</HI> This was Life from the dead to me; and by the &s;trength of this I walked many Days. (O who can expre&s;s the &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial Supports of GOD's Promi&s;es?) Yet it did not Convert me; it did not carry me to Chri&s;t, nor Reveal Him to me; but I remained as before, &s;ave only the pre&s;ent Support of it.</P>
<P>Quickly after this I entred into a more &s;trict Search of the My&s;tery of a Ju&s;tifying Faith; which the Divines variou&s;ly Expre&s;s, &s;ometimes calling it <HI>a mans going out of him&s;elf to Chri&s;t for Life;</HI> and &s;uch like De&s;criptions they give of it: I knew what the Scripture, and They, &s;aid of it, and could &s;peak about it as I had Learned; but I had no Spiritual or Feeling Sen&s;e of it, nor could I Conceive what it was in Reality &s;o to do: And when I con&s;idered the Nece&s;&s;ity of Ju&s;tification, Adoption &amp; Sanctification, a New Heart and Life, with Victory over all Spiritual Enemies in order to Life and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; to be obtained only by going out of my Self to CHRIST for them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which thing I could neither Do, nor po&s;&s;ibly Under&s;tand what it meant, my Salvation look'd then Impo&s;&s;ible. My Hopes were then reduced to the lowe&s;t Ebb,
<PB N="28" REF="002696_0021_0FE60BF433556350">
and I was about to quit both Hopes and Endea|vours about it. Now things were come to the la&s;t Extremity, which is the fitte&s;t &s;ea&s;on for Omnipotency to Interpo&s;e: I&s;a. 37.3. <HI>The Chil|dren are brought to the Birth, &amp; there is not &s;trength to bring forth.</HI> But now CHRIST's Hour was nearer than I knew of; for the next Sabbath, Mr. <HI>Noyes</HI> (that Man of God) in his fir&s;t Prayer of the Forenoon Exerci&s;e, framed a Petition to GOD in the&s;e words; <HI>viz. That although the Dif|ficulties in our way to the Heavenly</HI> Canaan, <HI>might &s;eem In&s;uperable to us, by rea&s;on of the City being Walled up to Heaven; and of the Mighty</HI> Anakims <HI>who mu&s;t be Overcome, Yet that we might not be Di&s;couraged, nor in our Hearts turn back into</HI> Egypt; <HI>but that we might be Taught to Look unto JES&V;S, who is Entred into the Heavens as Our Fore-runner, and able to Draw us after Him.</HI></P>
<P>I had hereupon &s;uch an Interview of CHRIST and of GOD through Him, as I never had had before any thing the like; but how Great! How Excellent! How Wonderful! How Glorious! And how Real and Evident! Words cannot at all Expre&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;aw the Lord JESUS CHRIST as having A&s;&s;umed the <HI>Humane Nature,</HI> and therein having Done and Suffered in the Place and Behalf of <HI>the Elect,</HI> to the mo&s;t Ample and Compleat Ac|ceptance of GOD the Father, and as being now Exalted unto the Dominion and Government of all Creatures in Heaven and in Earth, I appre|hended Him as Sitting on a Glorious Throne
<PB N="29" REF="002696_0021_0FE60BF433556350">
Exerci&s;ing His Three-fold Office, &amp; &s;ending forth His Spirit to Offer and Apply to the Elect, the Redemption Purcha&s;ed by Him, working Grace in them and bringing them at Length to a Participation of that Glory whereof He is Lord; and particularly offering <HI>this to me,</HI> with un&s;peak|able Freedom &amp; Good-will.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid I <HI>&s;aw the&s;e things,</HI> and what I mean is, that they were Di&s;covered to me with more Demon&s;tration and Reality than things which occupy our Sen&s;es are Evident to us when &s;ub|&s;tantially pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>And now, hereupon whether my whole Soul did agreeably make out after Him, &s;o as to Ac|cept of Him as He is Offered in the Go&s;pel, and was then particularly Offered to me, were a great Thing for me to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, You will look for the Evidence of it in my Conver&s;ation; and if there may be any thing found Evidential of the Truth of my Profe&s;&s;ion, let <HI>GOD have the Prai&s;e of it, through who&s;e Grace&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>And what&s;oever &s;hall appear Otherwi&s;e, he that &s;hall be forwarde&s;t to Reprove me for it in Love, &s;hall mo&s;t indear him&s;elf to me; <HI>Let the Ju&s;t &s;mite me it &s;hall be a Kindne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>And now you have had a True and Punctual Account, of the mo&s;t material Pa&s;&s;ages, both as to my being Led into Error, and gracious Return out of it; it being one of the wonderful Works of <HI>Him who is Perfect in Wi&s;dom.</HI></P>

Light within is not GOD, nor is it Mans Soul, but an Heavenly and Divine Principle, which Excites &amp; Di&s;po&s;es Men to that which is good; a little while after, he makes it a Sub&s;tance, yea a palpable Sub&s;tance, and &s;ays, that GOD is wrap't up in it, and cannot be Separated from it, he calls it the Vehicle of GOD: Sometimes the Spiritual Body of Chri&s;t, the Fle&s;h and Blood of Chri&s;t which came down from Hea|ven: A Minute after this, he makes it an Eatable Sub&s;tance, and &s;ays, that Good Men do Eat it and Drink the Blood of it, and &s;o are Nouri&s;hed unto Eternal Life, and this he calls the Communion of the Body &amp; Blood of Chri&s;t.

<HEAD>CHAP. 3 Giving an Account of the Vnrea&s;onablene&s;s of <HI>John Rogers</HI>'s Beasting of his Sufferings And Offering &s;ome Advice to &s;uch as hold his Principles of Religion.</HEAD>
<P>I Purpo&s;e in this La&s;t Chapter, to make a few Remarks upon &s;ome of <HI>John Rogers</HI>'s Suffer|ings
<PB N="54" REF="002696_0034_0FE60C17CC258AF8">
and the Cau&s;es of them: To the end it may be known that his Sufferings were not Per&s;ecu|tions, nor for his Religion and Con&s;cience, as he vainly and fal&s;ly Boa&s;ted, and as &s;ome ('tis like) have Believed; but that Really he was him&s;elf a Per&s;ecutor, and that his Sufferings were the Demerits of his horrid Immoralities &amp; Impieties,</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing that he mentioned on the account of his Sufferings, was the <HI>Divorcing his Wife from him</HI></P>
<P>To which I An&s;wer; That the Cau&s;e of it was his Adultery, Bea&s;tiality, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in which he had Lived for Divers years, as he Boa&s;ted and Endeavoured partly to ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>If any in his behalf object that the Proof was ln&s;ufficient, I An&s;wer that neither they nor I are Competent to Judge of that. And farther, that upon his Trial, he never denied a tittle of the Charge, and out of Court always Own'd it, and in particular to Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> who was his Council, but athereupon de&s;erted him and gave an Evidence again&s;t him; and for the Proof of this, I Refer the Reader to the Records and Files, in the Secretary's Office, at <HI>Hartford.</HI></P>
<P>The Second Suffering he Boa&s;ted of, was the taking, <HI>his Children from him,</HI> and Delivering them to their Mother, after the Divorce.</P>
<P>To which I An&s;wer, (Pretermitting what might be &s;aid, as to the Equity of that Law of this Colony, Directing and Enabling Over|&s;eers of the Poor, with the Advice of the Autho|rity,
<PB N="55" REF="002696_0034_0FE60C17CC258AF8">
to take into their Care &s;uch Children as are in danger greatly to &s;uffer, as well for want of Competent Education, as for want of Suitable Sub&s;i&s;tance) that the <HI>Mother</HI> had by Nature and Law as good Right to them as he had. More|over, The condition of the Children (being very Young) Required the Care of a Mother at the pre&s;ent; be&s;ides his Condition at that time forbade their abode with him, who through the force of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, went about Raging and Raving to that Degree, as that no Sober Man could have tho't him to be <HI>Compos mentis,</HI> or fit to have been a minute out of <HI>Bedlam,</HI></P>
<P>After &s;ome Years his Son was returned to him by Authority (which I'm &s;ure would be as hard a thing for me to Defend as the Contra|ry) but his Daughter having through GOD's Grace, &s;o Effectually Imbibed, not only the Principles of true Religion, but the Real Be|ginnings and Seeds of &s;aving Grace (as &s;ince has been more Evident) Nothing but force could have obliged her to abide with him, where|fore none was u&s;ed, for the&s;e two things he has un&s;peakably Rail'd upon &amp; Vilifi'd the Authority of the Government, Charging them with A|dultery in the former, and Per&s;ecution in both.</P>
<P>Nor was She, who had been Divorced from him able whil'&s;t Living to e&s;cape the Expre&s;&s;ions of his Rage; he loaded her with all manner of Reproaches and Lies, at an execrable Rate (at the &s;ame time pretending the greate&s;t Love) Concerning whom the Rules of truth would

Ju&s;tifie me in &s;peaking as much of her Exem plary Piety, Charity, Goodne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c</HI> in Life and of her Faith at Death, as of mo&s;t Good Women that have breathed; but its be&s;ides my purpo&s;e, nor is my Te&s;timony in Favour of my Mother &s;o Authentick as others; wherefore in this Re&s;pect I choo&s;e rather to Appeal (as I do with all Freedom) to the <HI>Reverend Pious &amp; Judi|cious Elder,</HI> and to the <HI>Whole Church and Neigh|bourhood at Lyme,</HI> whereof &s;he Lived a Beloved and Died a Lamented Member.</P>
<P>Another Suffering that he Gloried in, was his Whippings and Impri&s;onments; of which to &s;peak particularly and to &s;hew the Criminal Cau&s;es of them, would tire my &s;elf and you.</P>
<P>Wherefore let it &s;uffice to Affirm, that great Part of his lmpri&s;onment at <HI>Hartford,</HI> was upon &s;trong Su&s;picion of his being Acce&s;&s;ary to the Burning <HI>New-London Meeting-Hou&s;e,</HI> his Whip|pings there were for mo&s;t Audacious Contempt of Authority, his &s;itting on the Gallows was for Bla&s;phemous Words; and in &s;hort, he never Suffered the Lo&s;s of One Hair of his Head, by the Authority, for any Article of his Religion, nor for the Exerci&s;e of it; unle&s;s when he has Purpo&s;ely &amp; Contemptuou&s;ly put him&s;elf under the unavoidable Notice of <HI>Grand Jurors,</HI> or the like, in Labouring on the <HI>Sabbath, Bapti&s;ing,</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch Fact, which the Laws forbid.</P>
<P>No verily, it was not for his Religion; unle&s;s this were his Religion, <HI>viz.</HI> to Traduce and

Oppo&s;e the <HI>Sdbbath, Ordinances, Wor&s;hip, Mini&s;ters and People of God;</HI> yea, and the <HI>Government, Courts and Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice,</HI> in their Civil Ad|mini&s;trations, in a &s;ort, like as if his Salvation had depended upon his being an Inveterate and Con&s;tant Plague to Mankind: For it was for &s;uch things that he &s;uffer'd Impri&s;onments &amp; other Corporal Puni&s;hments. It was his manner to Ru&s;h into the A&s;&s;embly on the Lord's Day, in the time of God's Wor&s;hip, in a very Boi&s;terous Way, and to Charge the Mini&s;ter with Lies &amp; Fal&s;e Doctrine; and to Scream, Shout, Stamp, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which he offered in&s;ufferable Mole&s;tations to the Wor&s;hip and People of God: And this was his manner in the Court al&s;o, when he plea&s;ed or had a mind to make him&s;elf Sport, and he would Laugh at it when he had done, till his Sides &s;hook.</P>
<P>I &s;aw him once brought to Court for &s;uch a Di&s;turbance Committed on the Sabbath; he had contrived the matter &s;o as to be Ju&s;t without the Door when he was called to an&s;wer, upon which he Ru&s;hed into Court with a prodigious Noi&s;e, his Features and Ge&s;tures expre&s;&s;ed more Fury than I ever &s;aw in a Di&s;tracted Per&s;on of any &s;ort; and I &s;oberly think, that if a Legion of Devils had pu&s;h'd him in head-long, his En|trance had not been more Horrid and Gha&s;tly, nor have &s;eemed more Praeternatural.</P>
<P>When he came to the Bar, he demanded of the Court, what their Bu&s;ine&s;s was with him? The Indictment was ordered to be Read. To
<PB N="58" REF="002696_0036_0FE60C1EFB5646F0">
which he Pleaded, <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> after a new Mode; for as the Clerk Read, &s;ometimes at the End of a Sentence, and &s;ometimes at the Beginning, he'd Cry out, <HI>That's a Cur&s;ed Lie;</HI> and anon, <HI>That's a Devilli&s;h Lie!</HI> till at length a number of his Fol|lowers, of both Sexes, tuned their Pipes, and Scream'd, Roar'd, Shouted &amp; Stamped, to that Degree of Noi&s;e, that twas Impo&s;&s;ible to hear the Clerk Read. (But how contrary to the Meekne&s;s and Man&s;uetude of Chri&s;t's Sheep?) For which the Court put a Fine upon him, and &s;o added an Article to the &s;um of his Sufferings.</P>
<P>I am prone to think, he may have been &s;ome|times, Over done, by <HI>Officers,</HI> in their Collect|ing Rates and Fines of him; which if it were &s;o, the Authority could not have Redre&s;&s;ed it, for want of his Application to them in that Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>But before I Conclude, Let me Mention &s;ome other of his Sufferings; which tho' he Fretted at at Home, yet never Complained of Publickly, I mean what hapned to him about his Maid <HI>Mary Ransford;</HI> whom he fir&s;t Bought, then took to|his Bed (at lea&s;t when he wanted her) till &s;he proved with Child, and in the Fifth or Sixth Month of her Pregnancy, as I remember, he So|lemnly Betrothed her to him; then afterwards Dwelling with her &s;everal Years, and having had Two Children by her, upon &s;ome Di&s;gu&s;t, put her away, and all by his own Authority A|greeable

<P>After which he was Lawfully Married to a Woman <HI>of Oy&s;ter Bay,</HI> of Good Report, &s;ave only, that by her Religion, &s;he was one of tho&s;e Quakers, who for their Noi&s;yne&s;s,,are called <HI>Singing Quakers.</HI></P>
<P>I am not at all at a lo&s;s, how <HI>John Rogers</HI> and this Quaker Woman, over look'd the &s;mall Di&s;|parity in Religion, that was between them, &s;o as to Match together; but by what Sophi&s;try he levelled that horrible Jogg in his Conver&s;ation, Re&s;pecting <HI>Mary,</HI> afore&s;aid, I can't imagine.</P>
<P>To me, I Remember, he accounted for it after this &s;ort; Said he, <HI>I have Experienced Won|derful Operations of</HI> GOD <HI>'s Hand upon my Body, as well as upon my Soul;</HI> and &s;o Proceeding, Signified to me, that upon his entring into a &s;tate of Suf|ferings, he felt &s;uch a marvellous Mortification of his Members which were upon the Earth, as that <HI>his Venereal Propenfuy</HI> in particular, &s;eemed to be totally Extingui&s;hed; but however after he had Incountred the &s;harpe&s;t of his Trials, it flamed forth again, even beyond the Limits of Nature, whereby it was manife&s;t that God's Hand was in an Eminent way in it; <HI>Where|upon, &amp;c.</HI> And I never could get him an Inch further than this; yet he would not make a full Stop neither; but &s;ignified to me that in a more Convenient Time he would let me into that

My&s;tery, and fully Convince me that he did it by a Divine Impul&s;e, from Fir&s;t to La&s;t I gue&s;s he told Capt <HI>Witherell,</HI> who was then Judge of the Court, &s;omething of this Story, by the Judge's An&s;wer to him in Court.</P>

<P>In about Three or Four Months, as I remem|ber, <HI>Mary</HI> brought him a Child, he own'd it and got her with Child again, having &s;uffered Per&s;e|cution for the Fir&s;t according to Law; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>And</P>

<HI>which &s;eems Right to a man, but the End thereof are the ways of Death.</HI> That <HI>if it were po&s;&s;ible the very Elect &s;hould be Deceived,</HI> through the Activity of Error; That <HI>there is a Spirit of Error, as wll as a Spirit of Truth;</HI> And that by that Spirit of Error, men are Liable to be mi&s;&s;ed, not only in <HI>Spiritual Things,</HI> but al&s;o in a <HI>Spiritual Way,</HI> and therefore that it concerns you to Try the Spirits, whither they be of God.</P>
<P>And &s;uffer me to tell you how; and that is according to Gods In&s;titution &amp; the Practice of his People always.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Negatively,</HI> Do not try the Spirit by the Spirit, for that's no tryal at all: for you know a fal&s;e Spirit will give a fal&s;e Te&s;timony in his own Favour, wherefore &s;eek &s;ome Rule for the trying of the Spirits. I'll tell you what the Rule has been and what it is.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Affirmatively;</HI> Before the Fini&s;hing &amp; Com|pleating of the Scriptures, GOD's SPIRIT in all the Prophets, &amp; al&s;o in CHRIST &amp; his Apo&s;tles Evinced his Divinity and Godhead by <HI>Miracles:</HI> and although that be not the General Rule now for the trying of the Spirits, yet Miracles when &s;hewn mu&s;t be Granted to be good Proof at all times: So that if one comes to me, Commanding me in the name of the LORD, to take a Voyage into <HI>Turkey,</HI> Preach the Go&s;pel, or do &s;omething <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> out of my particular Calling; now if he
<PB N="64" REF="002696_0039_0FE60C2B59194B00">
will Verify his Mi&s;&s;ion, <HI>by Rai&s;ing the Dead,</HI> or the like Miraculous Action, I mu&s;t then Believe and Obey; otherwi&s;e I'll try him by the general Rule, which in Go&s;pel Times, is this;</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>To the Law and to the Te&s;timony, if they &s;peak not according to the&s;e, it is becau&s;e there is no Light in them.</HI> Wherefore be intreated to try the Spirits, that is, try your Principles, &amp; try tho&s;e Extraordinary Motions and Influences which &s;ometimes you feel, by the Rules of Gods Word.</P>
<P>I'll mention none of your Principles in parti|cular, and but one of your Practices, Left I be troublel&s;ome to you; and that is this, when you are moved to Di&s;turb others in their Wor&s;hip|ing of God according to their Con&s;ciences, then try that motion before you execute it. If I de|mand of you how you know God moved you thereunto? I know your An&s;wer will be,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>That you had</HI> a good End in it, <HI>&amp; therefore you know it was from the LORD; for Satan never makes God's Glory his End:</HI></P>
<P>An&s;wer, The End and De&s;ign does not of it &s;elf warrant the Action, <HI>Balaam</HI> had a Good End in going to Cur&s;e <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> it was to Enrich himfelf, which is Lawful for a man to do, provided it be, in a right Way &amp; by due Methods. Moreover <HI>Saul</HI> had a Good end in &s;paring the <HI>be&s;t of the Cattle, &amp;c.</HI> of the <HI>Amalekites;</HI> it was to <HI>Sacrifice to the Lord,</HI> a pious End, but the Action no
<PB N="65" REF="002696_0039_0FE60C2B59194B00">
the le&s;s abominable to GOD; and &s;o had the &s;ame man, doubtle&s;s, a good End <HI>in Offering Sacrifice.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, You'll &s;ay, <HI>That at the time when you felt that Impul&s;e, you were in</HI> a very Spiritual Frame, <HI>and had very great A&s;&s;urance that you were</HI> a Child of GOD; <HI>and that although Satan be permitted by Transforming him&s;elf into an Angel of Light, to Impo&s;e upon</HI> Hypocrites, <HI>yet be cannot &s;o Impo&s;e upon GOD</HI>'s <HI>Children.</HI> This I know is your Principle.</P>
<P>To which I <HI>An&s;wer,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> That it Remains to be proved that you are a Child of GOD; for you may be Extreme|ly Mi&s;taken in that point, and e&s;pecially Seeing (as I full well know) that you pretend to no other Proof of it, than the witne&s;&s; of that Spirit, which I am now advi&s;ing you to try; and that thus the ca&s;e is with you in this Re&s;pect, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. You know you are a Child of GOD, becau&s;e the Spirit of GOD dwells in you, and you are led by it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. You know that the Spirit of GOD dwells in &amp; leads you, becau&s;e you are a Child of God.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>Sirs,</HI> This is a way of Arguing far below what GOD expects of rational Beings. What is there to be &s;poken of, that can't be proved in this Way? May not the Angels of God, prove them|&s;elves Apo&s;tates, &amp; the Devils prove them&s;elves <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> by this circular Way of arguing, if Sound?
<PB N="66" REF="002696_0040_0FE60C2B6861F788">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> In An&s;wer to that Principle, that Satan can't &s;o Impo&s;e on Gods Children; I &s;ay it Contradicts another of your Principles, and that is the Doctrine of a <HI>mixture of Spirits,</HI> where|in you hold that the Good and the Bad Spirit may per&s;onally Po&s;&s;e&s;s &amp; Influence a man at the &s;ame time; as it has often happened, as you &s;uppo&s;e to Divers of you; Particularly to him that went to <HI>Anoint the two Prophets.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> Be per&s;waded to take a view of <HI>John Rogers,</HI> and try him in &s;ome re&s;pects; I do not mean to try whether he be Sav'd or Lo&s;t (that's not our bu&s;ine&s;s, nor may we pry into it) but try whether he were a Mini&s;ter of CHRIST or not; for if he were not, you may well &s;u&s;pect your &s;elves to have been mi&s;led by him.</P>
<P>In trying of his Authority to Preach &amp; Bap|ti&s;e, I think you may &s;afely conclude that the Office of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter is like that of a Prie&s;t, in this Re&s;pect, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>No man takes the honour of it upon him&s;elf, but he that it called of GOD, as Aaron was,</HI> Heb 5.4. Wherefore the Apo&s;tle &s;ays plainly, in Rom. 10.25. <HI>How can they Preach except they be &s;ent?</HI></P>
<P>2. That the Call Of GOD Thereto, is either,</P>
<P><HI>Frist, Extraordinary,</HI> as GOD called divers of the Prophets of old, and as CHRIST called the Apo&s;tles, who always proved their Authority by Miracles; in&s;omuch that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> de&s;paired of being believed when GOD &s;ent him to the <HI>I&s;|raelites</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="002696_0040_0FE60C2B6861F788">
 in Bondage, without the Gift of Miracles; which therefore GOD gave him, that thereby he might prove his Mi&s;&s;ion to be Divine.</P>
<P>Or,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> lt is <HI>Ordinary, viz.</HI> by <HI>Ordination and Laying on of the Hands of the Persbytery;</HI> whereby that Power which CHRIST at fir&s;t ve&s;ted in the Apo&s;tles, is Delegated and Derived unto them; and this is the u&s;ual way in Go&s;pel Times, being fir&s;t practi&s;ed by the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, and ever &s;ince followed in the Church in all Ages; and every man pretending to that Office has al|ways been able to prove his Authority in the one or other of the&s;e ways, excepting a few &s;uch as <HI>George Fox</HI> and <HI>John Rogers.</HI></P>
<P>I know he u&s;ed to &s;ay when pinched in this Point, that his Converts and the Succe&s;s of his Mini&s;try, were the Evidence of his Apo&s;tle|&s;hip; but if that Argument will do, then was <HI>Mahomet</HI> a Prophet of the LORD, &amp; <HI>Sabbatai Sevi</HI> the Eternal Son of GOD; for they had more Di&s;ciples than he.</P>
<P><HI>Once more,</HI> Be per&s;waded to make a few &s;hort, but Rea&s;onable Reflections on &s;ome part of his Life, and &s;ee if you can therein Di&s;cover the Characters &amp; Signs of a Mini&s;ter of CHRIST; Particularly the matter about <HI>Mary R<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ford.</HI> And methinks Rea&s;on &s;hould Guide you thus in your tho'ts about it, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. That &s;he was either his Lawful Wife, or not; if not, then his [W&mdash;e,] with whom <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ived in Fornication divers Years; which
<PB N="68" REF="002696_0041_0FE60C2FA427EF88">
cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;tand with the Perfection he pretended to, and Infallible Guidance of GOD's SPIRIT.</P>
<P>Or,</P>
<P>2 If &s;he were his Lawful Wife, then his putting her away was without Sufficient Grounds, not being any where Warranted by Laws neither Divine nor Humane, nay Condemned by his own Writing, &amp; Con&s;equently he broke Wed|lock, and committed Adultery in &s;o doing. If you Reply, that <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> did as bad; I'll Grant it: but I ob&s;erve that they both Repented of, Confe&s;&s;ed and For&s;ook their Sins; but he always Ju&s;tified his and Lived in it to the day of his Death, that is his Adultery. If &s;he were his Wife, as I think you will Judge &s;he was, let that land where it will rather than to make him a Fornicator. Now I am per&s;waded that if you do but u&s;e your Under&s;tandings in the ca&s;e, you cannot Reconcile the&s;e things and his preten&s;ions of Holine&s;s and Purity together; and if not, then what follows, but that he was an <HI>horrible Liar and Impo&s;tor!</HI> and that all his Doctrines are to be Su&s;pected and Immediately &s;canned &amp; &s;ifted to the Bran. Which if GOD Enable you to, I am &s;ure you will &s;oon perceive that you have not been in the way that <HI>Leads to Life,</HI> though it has &s;eemed Right to you.</P>
<P>Cry to GOD for Under&s;tanding; its He that <HI>Leads the Blind</HI> by a way which they knew not.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> Pray and Strive again&s;t this one Evil in &s;pecial, which otherwi&s;e will greatly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
