<P>_A NARRATIVE of this School was publi&s;hed in the Year 1763.

The following Pages are de&s;igned to exhibit to the Reader, the State of &s;aid School from the a|bove Date to <HI>September</HI> 3d, 1765; by which may appear to the impartial and candid Rea|der, the &s;ingular Smiles of Divine Providence, by which it has been hitherto &s;upported, and the encouraging Pro&s;pects of it's future and exten&s;ive U&s;efulne&s;s.</P>

<P>The Mi&s;&s;ionaries were ordained <HI>April</HI> 24th&mdash;at which Time we had not one Penny in Stock to &s;upport the great Charge of ex|ecuting the Plan we had lain, as may appear by the Account con|nected herewith: nor any where to look or depend for the &s;ame, but upon him who di&s;po&s;es the Hearts of Men as he plea&s;es, to accompli&s;h his own De&s;igns. The Mi&s;&s;ionaries and Schoolma&s;ters were cloathed, and furni&s;hed with four Hor&s;es, Furniture, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. with all convenient Speed; and had no Occa&s;ion to wait one Day to be furni&s;hed with a pre&s;ent Supply of Money for the Support of their &s;everal Mi&s;&s;ions; and all &s;at out, viz. <HI>David Fowler</HI> on the 29th of <HI>April</HI>&mdash;Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Smith</HI> and <HI>Chamberlain</HI> on the 19th of <HI>June</HI>&mdash;and, on the 25th of the &s;ame, the Re&s;t of the Schoolma&s;ters followed them (excepting <HI>Jacob Fowler</HI> who was detained with a View, if God &s;hould open a Door for it, to accompany an Engli&s;h Youth to a yet more remote Tribe, to learn their Language, and fit for a Mi&s;&s;ion among them) and carried with them &s;ome pre&s;ent Supply for Mr. <HI>Kirtland.</HI></P>

To this Party the Rev. Mr. <HI>Forbes</HI> and Mr. <HI>Rice</HI> were &s;ent by the Honorable corre&s;pon|ding <HI>Scotch</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and ga|thered a Church con&s;i&s;ting of 12 or 14 Mem|bers in 1762. But the la&s;t Spring the Famine prevailed in that Place before Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> could get there, &s;o that the Indians were obliged to remove and di&s;per&s;e, in order to get a living, 'til their Corn &s;hould be fit to eat. And ac|cordingly, Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> with Mr. <HI>Gunn</HI> his In|terpreter, went to the large&s;t Party of them, who were for the pre&s;ent &s;et down by the Lake <HI>Ut&s;age,</HI> at the Head of <HI>Su&s;quehanna-Ri|ver;</HI> where he put <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> one of the afore|mentioned <HI>Mohawk</HI> Boys, into a &s;mall School, in&s;tead of <HI>Jo&s;eph Woolley</HI> who was appointed School-ma&s;ter to that Tribe, but was then &s;ick at <HI>Cherry-Valley.</HI> The Account of this School I give in the Words of Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s Letter, da|ted at &s;aid Lake, <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 3d 1765.&mdash; <Q>I am every Day diverted and plea&s;ed with a View of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and his School; as I can &s;it in my Study, and &s;ee him and all his Scholars at any Time, the School-Hou&s;e being no|thing but an open Barrack.

as you will &s;ee in almo&s;t any wor|&s;hipping A&s;&s;embly: and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> at the Head of them with the Gravity of a Divine of Fif|ty or Three&s;core. How agreeable &s;uch a Sight would be to you, is not hard to gue&s;s! I expect this School will be much larger when it comes to <HI>Onohokwage,</HI> as there are but a few here, and many of tho&s;e that are, upon the Account of the pre&s;ent Scarcity, are obliged to employ their Children. The School at <HI>Onohokwage</HI> will doubtle&s;s be large enough for <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> both.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jo&s;eph Woolley</HI> lived with this Party of In|dians at <HI>Onohokwage</HI> la&s;t Winter, in order to teach their Children, and learn their Lan|guage. But there were not many of them in|clined to &s;end their Children to learn Engli&s;h. The Chief Sachem &s;aid, they might learn enough in Indian; which Notion, I &s;uppo&s;e, he and that Party imbibed from &s;ome white People who had been there. But after <HI>Peter</HI>'s return to them from hence in the Spring, they &s;eemed unanimou&s;ly inclined to have an Eng|li&s;h School &s;et up; and are much engaged to introduce Agriculture among them, and have lately petitioned earne&s;tly to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted there|in by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and de&s;ire to have Mills built, and a Black&s;mith &s;ettled with them, and &s;o many of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to &s;ettle among them, as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;truct them in the&s;e Affairs. They promi&s;e they will ob&s;erve and obey to their utmo&s;t, all the Advice and In|&s;truction &s;ent them by <HI>Peter</HI> la&s;t Spring.&mdash;
<PB N="15" REF="010207_0014_0F7D90F9F9F33098">
They have promi&s;ed to build a Hou&s;e for <HI>Jo|&s;eph Woolley,</HI> and help him fence &s;ome Lands for Tillage, and for keeping Cows, &amp;c. and to do all on their Part, and within their Power, to enable him to govern and teach their Chil|dren. And I hope &s;oon to hear, that he and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> are &s;ettled in a large School at that Place. This is a remarkable Alteration in their Di&s;|po&s;ition. The like al&s;o, <HI>David Fowler</HI> informs me, appears in the Indians at <HI>Oneida,</HI> about a hundred Miles di&s;tant from thence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Chamberlain,</HI> after he had &s;ettled &s;everal Indian Boys in Schools in &s;everal Indian Towns in the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Country; viz. <HI>Hezekiah Calvin</HI> in a School of 24 Scholars, <HI>Abraham Primus</HI> in one of 16, and <HI>Abraham Secundus</HI> in one of 11; was about to go with the <HI>Oneidaes,</HI> on their return to their Country, which they al&s;o had been obliged to leave, on account of the Famine there. At that Place he purpo&s;ed to &s;pend the mo&s;t of his Time this Year; and takes <HI>Johannes</HI> with him for his Interpreter, who has hitherto &s;erved him in that Capacity; and at proper Sea&s;ons to vi&s;it the Schools which he has erected.</P>
<P><HI>David Fowler</HI> met with a kind Reception among the Indians at <HI>Oneida;</HI> and &s;et up a School among them in <HI>May,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of 26 Scholars, and continued in it &s;ome Weeks. He al&s;o taught a &s;inging School, in which the Indians made great Proficiency, and had lear|ned well to carry three Parts to &s;everal Tunes.
<PB N="16" REF="010207_0015_0F7D90FA9A798EB0">
They promi&s;ed to build him a Hou&s;e, and be|gan to prepare Materials, (i.e. HemlockBark) to build it. They al&s;o promi&s;ed him a free U&s;e and Improvement of their Lands, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in clearing and fencing them; and were many ways exerting them&s;elves to &s;et up Hu&s;bandry, and de&s;ired him to in&s;truct them therein. But by rea&s;on of the Famine which prevailed among them, they were o|bliged to remove with their Children 'til their Corn &s;hould be fit to eat; and de&s;ired <HI>David</HI> to come down to <HI>New-England,</HI> and procure a Carpenter, who might be able to build them Hou&s;es, make Ploughs, Carriages, &amp;c. for them; and de&s;ired he would return to them when they &s;hould be able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in their Country; which he has al&s;o done. They al&s;o promi&s;ed to &s;end their Children to School, and &s;uitably encourage him in governing them, &amp;c. He yet finds difficulty in commu|nicating to them the Things of Religion, not being &s;ufficiently Ma&s;ter of their Language, and having no &s;kilful Interpreter with him. But he hopes this will be &s;oon remedied by his becoming compleat Ma&s;ter of their Tongue.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Kirtland,</HI> who went among that &s;avage and bruti&s;h Tribe, the <HI>Senecas,</HI> la&s;t Fall, &s;oon after the Peace was &s;ettled with them, to learn, their Language, and fit him&s;elf, and prepare the Way for a Mi&s;&s;ion among them, was o|bliged, on account of the Famine which pre|vailed
<PB N="17" REF="010207_0016_0F7D90FB52123880">
in that Country, to come to <HI>Mohawk</HI>-River, two Hundred Miles, la&s;t <HI>June,</HI> for Sup|plies; and brought with him 13 <HI>Seneca</HI> Boys, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in carrying his Provi&s;ions to that Country. Soon after they came down, 12 of the Boys were taken &s;ick with a Dy&s;entery, and four of them died. The re&s;t recovered, and are returned with Mr. <HI>Kirtland.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Kirtland</HI> has &s;urpri&s;ingly in&s;inuated him&s;elf into their Affection and E&s;teem. Their Jealou&s;ies of him, which at fir&s;t were very &s;trong, are now removed. They are fond of his continuing with them; and he hoped, &s;oon on his return to them, to be able to &s;et up a large School among them. And as &s;oon as he is become &s;ufficiently Ma&s;ter of their Lan|guage, they expect to hear great Things from him. And if God &s;hall mercifully pre&s;erve this Youth to accompli&s;h the Plan laid for him, on which there has evidently been the Smiles of Heaven hitherto, it will perhaps be e&s;teemed, when it &s;hall be fully known in all the Circum&s;tances of it, to have been as ex|traordinary an Undertaking of this kind, as has ever been in this Land.</P>

under God, chiefly indebted) has not been wanting in his Care and Endeavors for Mr. <HI>Kirtland</HI>'s Safety and U&s;efulne&s;s among them.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Affairs are many of them yet &s;o new, and my Di&s;tance from the Mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;o great, and no Po&s;t to keep up a Corre&s;pon|dence with them, that my Accounts at pre|&s;ent mu&s;t needs be very imperfect: Nor am I yet able any further to a&s;certain the Number of Indian Children now at the &s;everal Schools in the Wilderne&s;s. However, all Accounts I have yet received, agree, that there is an un|u&s;ual De&s;ire of Knowledge among tho&s;e who have got a little Under&s;tanding of Chri&s;tianity; and a great Willingne&s;s, and, in many In|&s;tances, a De&s;ire to have their Children taught. &mdash;Their Jealou&s;ies of the Engli&s;h, &s;eem more than ever to be removed.&mdash; Mi&s;&s;ionaries and School-ma&s;ters are received and treated with more Re&s;pect and Kindne&s;s than u&s;ual.&mdash;And among &s;ome Parties, &s;uch a De&s;ire and En|gagedne&s;s to introduce Agriculture, and de|pend upon that, in&s;tead of rambling and hunting, for a Living, as has never been be|fore known: and a Motive hereto with many of them &s;eems to be, that they and their Chil|dren may be in a better Capacity to receive In&s;truction, than is po&s;&s;ible while they are on their fi&s;hing and hunting Marches hundreds of Miles together.</P>
<P>And by the Way I would ob&s;erve, that if only here and there a Tribe were civilized,
<PB N="19" REF="010207_0018_0F7D90FCC3EBB538">
chri&s;tianized, and Hu&s;bandry introduced a|mong them, what agreeable Places of Retreat might the&s;e be for our Mi&s;&s;ionaries! And what a Saving of the great Expence for their Support, which cannot be avoided, &s;o long as their Provi&s;ions are to be tran&s;ported &s;uch a great Di&s;tance! Be&s;ides the many u&s;eful In|telligences they will have from a <HI>Pri&s;cilla</HI> and <HI>Aquila</HI> there, and many comforting and ani|mating Con&s;iderations &s;ugge&s;ted to encourage and &s;trengthen them in the Work of the Lord! And I would humbly propo&s;e to Con&s;iderati|on, whether the Advantages we may expect hereby, will not be worth all the Co&s;t and Pains that will be nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t the poor Creatures to &s;et up Hu&s;bandry, and give them all nece&s;&s;ary In&s;truction in the Practice of it? I conceive the nece&s;&s;ary Expence for this will not be va&s;tly great. And when it is once introduced into a few Places, they will &s;oon be able to a&s;&s;i&s;t their Brethren, and &s;o carry the Practice &s;till further into other Tribes. I doubt not, the Thoughts of Gentlemen of Penetration, will at once &s;ugge&s;t many and very great Advantages that may accrue to the general De&s;ign hereby.</P>
<P>And as Divine Providence has always from the fir&s;t prevented me with &s;ea&s;onable Supplies, before the Ca&s;e came to extremity, or to be at all di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, however threatning the Ap|pearances have often been; &s;o I would hope in the &s;ame Fountain of Goodne&s;s to &s;upply
<PB N="20" REF="010207_0019_0F7D90FD746BE818">
the&s;e growing Nece&s;&s;ities. And this I think we may do with the more Confidence, as we have endeavoured to go no fa&s;ter in the Af|fair, than to ob&s;erve the Openings, and follow the plaine&s;t Dictates of Providence in every Step that has been taken. And hitherto &s;carce a Step has been taken, but God has evidently made it to pro&s;per. If the Cau&s;e be God's, and the Cour&s;e we &s;teer right, it is &s;afe enough.</P>
<P>But I would humbly propo&s;e to Con&s;idera|tion, whether as &s;wift a Progre&s;s of this Work as may be, is not likely to be attended with greater Succe&s;s proportionable to the Expence, than a more lei&s;urely Procedure? which will not have that Tendency to awaken their At|tention, convince their Con&s;ciences, and pro|voke them to Emulation; and which will give the Adver&s;aries to it much more Oppor|tunity to embarra&s;s the Way.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me, that the peculiar Circum|&s;tance of the Newne&s;s of the Thing, and Re|&s;olution of God's People to accompli&s;h it, and to do it by &s;uch Means and Endeavours, as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily appear great and &s;trange to the Savages, is, in it&s;elf, likely to have great Force and Influence to make them hear atten|tively, and con&s;ider clo&s;ely, the Nature, Im|portance, and Evidence of the Things &s;poken to them; and to convince them effectually of the Sincerity of our Intentions towards them, while they &s;ee our Practice to be &s;o agreeable to the va&s;t Importance of the Errand on which
<PB N="21" REF="010207_0020_0F7D9100612E2BD0">
we come to them. And while our Endea|vours are u&s;ed, as they now are, &s;o much by their own Sons, we have a great additional Advantage to avoid the mi&s;chievous Effects of tho&s;e Jealou&s;ies and Su&s;picions which they have &s;o long entertained, that, notwith&s;tand|ing all our Pretentions, there is a &s;ecret Plot laid to get away their Lands, and make a Prey of them.</P>
<P>The Number of Charity-Scholars now be|longing to this School, is eighteen; be&s;ides the five <HI>Mohawk</HI> Boys before-mentioned, as employed in the Indian Country, who are expected to return to the School next Winter. Eleven of the&s;e are Males, [5 Engli&s;h and 6 Indians] and &s;even Indian Females. Two of the&s;e Engli&s;h and two Indian Boys, are de|&s;igned to be coupled, an Engli&s;h and an In|dian, and to be &s;ent into &s;ome remote Tribes next Spring, if Providence &s;hall favour it, to learn their Languages, and prepare for a Mi&s;|&s;ion among them.</P>
<P>I am daily expecting two more <HI>Delaware</HI> Boys, and one from <HI>Narragan&s;et;</HI> and before Winter, if they may be well cho&s;en, a Num|ber from the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> among which is the Grand&s;on to the <HI>Onondaga</HI> Sachem. And I have the Plea&s;ure of thinking, that the Boys I have, are in general, very promi&s;ing.</P>
<P>It was generally thought, before I had a|ny Boys from the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Country, that nei|ther the Parents could be per&s;uaded to &s;end,
<PB N="22" REF="010207_0021_0F7D9100D0614878">
nor their Children to come to School, at &s;uch a great Di&s;tance. And the fir&s;t three who came, appeared to come with great Caution and Fear&mdash;brought each of them an Hor&s;e with them, prepared to return in ha&s;te, if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion. But &s;o great is the Alteration in this Re&s;pect, that the Difficulty now is not in procuring what Number I plea&s;e; but in obtaining &s;uch as are promi&s;ing, and &s;uch as are, on account of their Families, of greate&s;t Importance to their Tribes.</P>
<P>I would take this Opportunity to renew my Thanks to the kind Benefactors of this School, for tho&s;e generous Benefactions, by which it has, through the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing, continued to this Time. And de&s;ire the Continuance of their fervent Supplications at the Throne of Divine Grace, for all that Light, Direction, and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary, for all tho&s;e who are any way actively concerned in promoting the important De&s;ign; and for that Ble&s;&s;ing of God upon all Endeavours, without which the be&s;t Plans, and mo&s;t vigo|rous Efforts to put them in Execution, will be to no Purpo&s;e. And I per&s;wade my&s;elf, that the growing Pro&s;pects of Succe&s;s, will be a further and very &s;trong Inducement to that Liberality, which will bear Proportion to the great Expences nece&s;&s;ary therein. And e&s;pe|cially if it be con&s;idered, that the&s;e young Gentlemen who are employed in this Bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="23" REF="010207_0022_0F7D910168CD7AF8">
and are expo&s;ed to all the Hard&s;hips and Dan|gers of the Wilderne&s;s, without any comfort|able Habitation, or any Accommodations to indulge the Plea&s;ures of the natural or &s;ocial Life, have entered upon this Service, not through any Nece&s;&s;ity, or want of any lucra|tive and honorable Po&s;ts they might de&s;ire a|mong their Brethren; but only to &s;erve the great De&s;igns of advancing the Kingdom of the Redeemer, and the Salvation of the Souls of Men. And they a&s;k for, and de&s;ire no o|ther Reward for all their Service, but to be &s;upported while they are employed in it. And I am per&s;waded, that the Accounts them|&s;elves of their Expences, when Time &s;hall give an Opportunity to &s;et them in a true Light, will be &s;ufficient Evidence of their Prudence and Frugality.</P>

<P>The Reverend Mr. <HI>Chamberlain</HI> returned from his Mi&s;&s;ion among the Six Nations, la&s;t Friday, (accompa|nied by two <HI>Oneyada</HI> Boys, for this School) to procure another Mi&s;&s;ionary for one of the Places where he has been preaching among the <HI>Mohawks</HI> and <HI>Oneyadas;</HI> and to get Recruits and Supplies of Nece&s;&s;aries for the Winter, for him&s;elf and the Schoolma&s;ters, who de&s;ign to winter with the Indians.</P>
<P>He informs me, that the Indian Schoolma&s;ters have, in general, conducted very well: are received chear|fully, and treated kindly; and that there are now in their &s;everal Schools, 127 Children; and that he had provided another School of upwards of 20 Children more, for <HI>Peter;</HI> but he was taken &s;ick, and could not enter into it&mdash;which is ready for him, or another, next Spring.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Chamberlain</HI> al&s;o informs me, that he has lately made a Tour among the <HI>Onondagas</HI> (accompanied with Delegates from the <HI>Mohawks</HI> and <HI>Oneyadas</HI>) and prea|ched to them, where never any Mi&s;&s;ionary had been be|fore. That the Repre&s;entative of that whole Tribe, told him, after a Con&s;ultation of two Days among them&s;elves, that they were all agreed to receive Chri&s;|tianity, and would have him be ea&s;y in his Mind, and know, that from that Day they &s;hould be glad to be in&s;tructed; and de&s;ired him to tarry and preach to them. And when he left them he told them he would do his Endeavour that a Mini&s;ter &s;hould be &s;ent to them next Spring.</P>
