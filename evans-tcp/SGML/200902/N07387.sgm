<P>_THERE are Thou&s;ands in the World, of &s;uch a dull, &s;tupid, moro&s;e, and &s;ullen Turn of Mind, as to think every Thing that wears not the Face of De|jection, di&s;&s;olute; and who decry the mo&s;t innocent Chearfulne&s;s as criminal.</P>
<P>As Liquors tinge the containing Ve&s;&s;el, the Severity of the&s;e Mens Complexion gives a Gloom to Religion, which is paint|ed by them, as wearing a continual Frown, and with Features inflexible to any Sort of Chearfulne&s;s: And though the Rea&s;on of Things, the Methods of Providence, the Order of the World, and the Scriptures
<PB N="4" REF="009424_0004_0F743BCE324B4268">
them&s;elves, are unitedly again&s;t this &s;our and &s;urly Stoici&s;m, yet &s;uch is the perver&s;e Turn of Mind of the&s;e Men, that in&s;tead of lay|ing hold with Rapture on &s;uch Methods as are offer'd for their better Information, they have as ob&s;tinately &s;et them&s;elves down to cavil at them, as if in&s;tead of the utmo&s;t Benefit, the highe&s;t Injury had been offer'd, and Outrage committed again&s;t them.</P>
<P>MANY, actuated by this perver&s;e Turn of Mind, in other Re&s;pects of &s;trong Abili|ties, have been vainly and impiou&s;ly tempt|ed to murther their Time in traver&s;ing the Bible merely to pick out Texts and Portions of it in Support of their contracted No|tions; when, after all, they have done No|thing to their Purpo&s;e, but like the hungry peevi&s;h Viper in the Fable, broke their Teeth upon a File that mocked their idle Frenzy.</P>
<P>THIS fills the Minds of &s;uch as are con|nected with them in Society, and who fall into the Snare, with unfavourable Senti|ments towards their Fellow-Citizens; wrong Ideas of Per&s;ons and Things they are not acquainted with; and uncharitable Inter|pretations of tho&s;e Actions of which they
<PB N="5" REF="009424_0005_0F743BCEF1715D28">
are by no Means competent Judges: It in|&s;tils into their Minds the utmo&s;t Violence and Bitterne&s;s, and eradicates that Charity and Brotherly-love, which is the Ornament and Perfection of Religion, and the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able Means for attaining the End of it.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE that excellent Writer, Arch|bi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q>That it will be hard to determine how many Degrees of Innocency and Good-nature, or of Cold|ne&s;s and Indifferency in Religion, are nece&s;&s;ary to overbalance the Fury and Mi&s;chiefs of a blind Zeal.</Q></P>
<P>BISHOP <HI>Gib&s;on</HI> al&s;o, &s;peaking of the fatal Con&s;equences of <HI>Bigotry,</HI> has this excellent Ob&s;ervation;&mdash;&s;peaking of the <HI>Jews,</HI> he &s;ays, <Q>The more they failed in the inward Obedience of the Heart, and the Duties of moral Goodne&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, the greater Zeal they &s;hew'd for the outward and ritual Parts of the Law.</Q></P>
<P>TRUE Devotion langui&s;hes, while the Mind is divided and taken up with Con|trover&s;ies and Debates concerning Ceremo|nies, which in them&s;elves cannot be &s;aid to
<PB N="6" REF="009424_0006_0F743BCFCDA973A8">
be e&s;&s;ential to Religion, but mo&s;tly prove prejudicial to it, by occa&s;ioning weak Minds to &s;et too high a Value on them, and to mi&s;take the Shadow for the Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>WHATEVER Expedients, therefore, can be found to allay the&s;e Animo&s;ities, which break us into different Factions and Intere&s;ts, cannot but be u&s;eful to Religion in general, and highly tend to its Reputation and In|crea&s;e among Men.</P>
<P>AND certain I am, that were the Clergy of all Denominations, obliged to preach up the Nece&s;&s;ity of Brotherly-love, and prohi|bited from u&s;ing Invectives again&s;t tho&s;e who differ from them in the ceremonial Forms of Devotion, the Face of Religion, through|out the Land, would wear a different A&s;|pect; nor would Men have le&s;s Love for each other becau&s;e of their Difference in the Modes of Wor&s;hip: But while the Churches are daily pronouncing their horrid and bla&s;|phemous Anathemas again&s;t tho&s;e of diffe|rent Communities, the deluded Flock, who look on them&s;elves as of the Hou&s;hold of GOD, are taught to regard and hate tho&s;e of other Per&s;ua&s;ions, as of the Hou&s;hold of the Devil.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="009424_0007_0F743BD16C4F1038">THIS is a Fact of the greate&s;t Notoriety; all Men know it, and none will deny it: In&s;tead of multiplying the&s;e de&s;irable Op|portunities, where we may agree in Points of publick Wor&s;hip, that are indifferent in them&s;elves, we let the Spirit of Contention into tho&s;e very Methods that are not only foreign to vital Religion, but &s;hould in their Nature di&s;po&s;e us to be Friends: This our Anger in our Devotion, is like Poi&s;on in Perfume, which taints the Spi|rits, in&s;tead of chearing and refre&s;hing them.</P>
<P>THIS unhappily being the Ca&s;e, I &s;hall not wonder if the Attempt I am making to|wards introducing the U&s;e of In&s;trumental Mu&s;ick into the Wor&s;hip of tho&s;e Societies who have hitherto been taught to look up|on &s;uch as unlawful, and un&s;criptural, &s;hould be attended with the &s;ame Oppo&s;ition with the Promulgation of the Go&s;pel it&s;elf, and the Promoter of it expo&s;ed to the &s;ame Bigotry and mi&s;guided Zeal. However, as every well-meant Attempt de&s;erves Appro|bation and Encouragement, I &s;hall venture to lay my Thoughts on this Subject before the Publick; which, though they may be far &s;hort of the End propos'd, may yet per|haps
<PB N="8" REF="009424_0008_0F743BD23A286998">
have the Merit of &s;ugge&s;ting &s;ome Hints to others who may be Lovers of the divine Harmony I am contending for, and better qualified to make the Attempt.</P>
<P>HAVING thus briefly premi&s;ed the fatal Tendency of a blind mi&s;guided Zeal, and &s;hewed that it is not only de&s;tructive of So|ciety, but a Bar to the Advancement of Re|ligion in the World, I &s;hall now proceed to note the Origin of In&s;trumental Mu&s;ick; the <HI>Lawfulne&s;s of u&s;ing &s;uch in divine Wor|&s;hip;</HI> and that it has been held <HI>&s;o</HI> by <HI>the far greater Part</HI> of the Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity in all Ages of the World, even down to the pre&s;ent Time.</P>
<P>As the Scriptures are univer&s;ally acknow|ledged to be given by the In&s;piration of GOD, the mo&s;t probable Way to &s;trengthen my Argument, and remove the Prejudices of &s;uch as are di&s;pos'd to cavil at the In&s;titu|tion I am recommending, will be to take my Mea&s;ures of it occa&s;ionally, from tho&s;e who were immediately directed and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in it by the HOLY GHOST.</P>
<P>AND fir&s;t, with regard to the Origin of Vocal and In&s;trumental Mu&s;ick, they were
<PB N="9" REF="009424_0009_0F743BD2AFE27410">
doubtle&s;s among the mo&s;t early Inventions of the Sons of Men: <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> particularly tells us, <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> iv. 21, that <HI>Jubal,</HI> long before the Flood, followed the making &s;uch mu&s;i|cal In&s;truments as were then u&s;ed in the Wor&s;hip of GOD, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Harp</HI> and OR|GAN, as a Trade: And with regard to Vo|cal Mu&s;ick, we are told, <HI>Job</HI> xxxviii, that when the ALMIGHTY had laid the Foun|dations of the Earth, <Q>the Morning Stars &s;ang together, and all the Sons of GOD &s;houted for Joy.</Q></P>
<P>"IF, &s;ays a late Writer, we look back to the Records of Antiquity, we &s;hall find that &s;ome of the olde&s;t and mo&s;t exalted Com|po&s;itions of Men, are Songs of Prai&s;e and Exta&s;y to their GREAT CREATOR.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;omething in <HI>Poetry</HI> and <HI>Mu|&s;ick</HI> admirably &s;uited to divine Subjects; and it is natural for the Soul, when &s;truck with any Thing &s;urprizingly <HI>great, good</HI> or <HI>new,</HI> to break forth, beyond the common Modes of Speech, into the mo&s;t rapturous Turns of Expre&s;&s;ion; accompanied with corre&s;pondent Attitudes of Body and Modu|lations of Voice. Even the untutored Sa|vages around us, furni&s;h &s;triking Examples of this.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="009424_0010_0F743BD4DBB3D3D0">HENCE it is, that <HI>Poetry</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;ick</HI> were originally confined to the immediate Prai&s;es of the DEITY; and that the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Men of all Ages, have had Recour&s;e to di|vine Hymns and &s;piritual Songs, in the Ef|fu&s;ions of their Souls before the Almighty LORD of Heaven and Earth.</P>
<P>'ERE yet Temples were built, perhaps, or fixed Hours of Devotion &s;et apart; when the Voice of Con&s;cience could be heard, and the bu&s;y Scenes of Art had not yet &s;educed away the Attention of Man; the great Pro|genitors of our Race, as they tended their Flocks on from Pa&s;ture to Pa&s;ture, no Doubt, often felt their Hearts rapt into this Kind of &s;acred Exta&s;y, and poured them forth in un|premeditated Strains before the LORD.&mdash; Whenever they received any &s;ignal In&s;tance of Almighty Goodne&s;s; whenever any &s;ur|prizing Effect of Almighty Power &s;truck their Sight, and kindled Admiration; that au&s;picious Moment, doubtle&s;s, they em|braced and adored the invi&s;ible Hand from which the Whole proceeded; the Hand that formed the Earth, the Sun and Moon, which they beheld; that hung the Clouds in Air; that charged their Bo&s;oms with Trea&s;ures, and bade them drop down in Fatne&s;s to rejoice Herb, and Bea&s;t, and Man.</P>

<P>INDEED, Man could not behold the Beau|ties of Nature, without Admiration;&mdash;every Thing within and without him, contribut|ed to heighten this Joy into the mo&s;t tran&s;|cendent Exta&s;y; and a Sight of the won|drous Objects of Creation, mu&s;t in&s;pire him to return Thanks to the great Author of his Being, in the mo&s;t beautiful and plea&s;ing Sounds his Mind could &s;ugge&s;t!

<P><PB N="12" REF="009424_0012_0F743BD5B4DACEB8">THIS was, doubtle&s;s, the Origin of Mu|&s;ick, and it has ever &s;ince been applied by the <HI>Jews,</HI> and after them by the Generality of the Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, to its pro|per Object, the celebrating the Greatne&s;s of the Almighty, and the Magnificence of his Works; which the antient <HI>Hebrew</HI> Bards de&s;crib'd in the mo&s;t pompous, the mo&s;t maje&s;tick, and the mo&s;t &s;ublime Manner that is po&s;&s;ible to be conceiv'd, on all pub|lick Occa&s;ions!</P>
<P>BUT among all the Solemnities of this Nature, there is none in Hi&s;tory &s;o glori|ous as that under the Reign of King <HI>Solo|mon,</HI> at the Dedication of the Temple to the Wor&s;hip of GOD:&mdash;We are told, by an unerring Mouth, that be&s;ides the great Of|ficers of State, and Inhabitants of <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI> all the Elders and Heads of Tribes, with the whole Body of the People rang'd under them, from one End of the King|dom to the other, were &s;ummon'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t on this &s;olemn Occa&s;ion: When the Ark of the Covenant, containing the two Tables of the Law, was brought and depo&s;ited un|der the Wings of the Cherubims, in the holy Place, the great Concert of Prai&s;e be|gan:&mdash;It was enliven'd with an Hundred

and Twenty <HI>Trumpets,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a pro|portionable Number of other Kinds of <HI>mu|&s;ical In&s;truments,</HI> (among which we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ur'd the <HI>well-ton'd</HI> ORGAN found a Place) and accompanied with a prodigious Number of Voices of all the Singers of <HI>I&s;|rael,</HI> who were particularly in&s;tructed and &s;et apart for religious Performances of this Kind.</P>
<P>THE Bu&s;ine&s;s of this mighty Chorus was to extol their MAKER, and to excite the whole Nation, thus a&s;&s;embled, to the Prai&s;e of his never-cea&s;ing Goodne&s;s and Mercy: <Q>As the Trumpets and Singers were as one, to make one Sound to be heard, in prai&s;|ing and thanking the Lord; and when they lift up their Voice with the Trum|pets and Cymbals, and In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick, they prai&s;ed the Lord, &s;aying, For he is good, for his Mercy endureth for ever:</Q>&mdash;On which the Hou&s;e was filled with a Cloud, which evidently de|mon&s;trated the DIVINE PRESENCE among them; in&s;omuch that the Prie&s;ts them|&s;elves, not being able to bear the <HI>Awful|ne&s;s of the Solemnity,</HI> retir'd into the Court of the Temple.&mdash;In the mean While, the People, who&s;e Hearts were gradually mov|ed

by the Solemnity of the whole Proceed|ing, having been melted by the <HI>all-conquer|ing Strains of</HI> MUSICK, and aw'd by the Appearance of that Glory which fill'd the Temple, <Q>bowed them&s;elves with their Faces to the Ground, and wor&s;hipped and prai&s;ed the Lord!</Q></P>
<P>FROM hence, therefore, it appears, that it does not only betray a Want of Religion, but weak and childi&s;h Ignorance, not to &s;ee the <HI>Lawfulne&s;s</HI> of In&s;trumental Mu&s;ick in our Acts of Devotion towards GOD; nor can it be unworthy the Regard and Notice of the highe&s;t Rank of Mankind, when view'd, as it really is, as a mo&s;t &s;ublime Acqui&s;ition!</P>
<P>AND certain it is, that among all the Studies that engage the Mind of Man, the be&s;t adapted to his Nature, and to a &s;uitable Acknowledgement of the Greatne&s;s and Perfection of GOD, is <HI>that</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;ick:</HI>&mdash; While other Creatures only hear Sounds, in &s;uch a Manner as conduce to the Purpo&s;es of Animal Life, Man is capable of di&s;cover|ing their Proportions, and thereby qualified for the Perception and Plea&s;ure of Harmony, which, properly &s;peaking, cannot be a&s;|cribed

<P>LET dull phlegmatick Souls &s;ay what they will to the Contrary, Joy and Chear|fulne&s;s are &s;o far from being incon&s;i&s;tent with Religion, when rightly order'd, that we find them many Times allow'd and re|commended

in it &s;uitable In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick, with which to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Wor&s;hip of GOD: And thus much I am warranted to a&s;&s;ert from the <HI>New,</HI> that, as our LORD and his Apo&s;tles are often &s;aid to have made U&s;e of this very Temple for the Performance of divine Service therein, it evidences, to a Demon&s;tration, his continued Approba|tion of the Place, and of the decent Orna|ments with which it was decorated: Nor will any rea&s;onable Man pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that the co&s;tly and magnificent <HI>Organ,</HI> which had been erected therein for divine Wor&s;hip from the mo&s;t early Dedication of that &s;acred Edifice to the Service of GOD, had been pulled down on the Approach of the Saviour of the World, or was for ever after &s;ilent. Had this actually been the Ca&s;e, it would have been too remarkable an Incident to have been pa&s;&s;ed over in Silence by the &s;acred Penmen: On the contrary, our Lord's Veneration for it ro&s;e &s;o high, as to induce him to whip the Profaners of it hence; in which Act he brings a Quotation from the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> to &s;hew the original In|tent of that &s;acred Edifice:&mdash;<Q>It is written, &s;ays he, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> lvi. 7. and <HI>Jeremiah</HI> vii. 11. My Hou&s;e &s;hall be called the Hou&s;e of Prayer, but ye have made it a Den of

Thieves;</Q> but we have not the lea&s;t Au|thority from hence to infer that he attempt|ed to pull down, deface, alter, or render u&s;ele&s;s any the mo&s;t minute Article of its Contents: Nor do we find a &s;ingle Text in the Whole of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> di&s;approv|ing or di&s;allowing the U&s;e of In&s;trumental Mu&s;ick in the Wor&s;hip of God; which plainly demon&s;trates, that &s;uch Things were not only continued in U&s;e, but were ap|prov'd of and allow'd as heretofore. And this &s;eems &s;o plainly to be the Ca&s;e, that it might be e&s;teemed a Reproach to human Rea&s;on to u&s;e more Arguments to evince its Utility, &s;eeing the univer&s;al Reception it has met with from all thinking People, in all Ages of the World, and in all Places, manife&s;tly evidences, that it is entirely &s;uit|able, proportionate, and agreeable to the general Conception and Rea&s;on of Man|kind.</P>
<P>I DOUBT not but I &s;hall be condemned by &s;ome of my Readers for having expre&s;|&s;ed my&s;elf with too much Warmth on this Subject; and by others for having omitted &s;aving many Things which the Authority of Holy Writ gives me a &s;ufficient Warrant to have urg'd:&mdash;As to the fir&s;t, the In&s;tances

<P>THE Wor&s;t, however, that can be &s;aid of this Attempt is, that it is the Overflow|ing of a Heart &s;incere and ardent for the Happine&s;s of Society in general, and of that of which I am a Member in particular.</P>
