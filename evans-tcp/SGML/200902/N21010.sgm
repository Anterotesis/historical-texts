<P>GEORGE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> FORASMUCHAS it is humbly meant and complained to us, by our right tru&s;ty ROBERT DUNDAS, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Arni&s;ton, our Advocate, for our intere&s;t upon MAURICE MARGAROT, merchant in Marybon, London, No. 10, High-&s;treet, re&s;iding or lately re&s;iding, at the Black Bull Inn, head of Leith Walk, pari&s;h of St. Cuthbert's, and County of Edinburgh: THAT WHEREAS, by the laws of this, and of every well governed realm, SEDITION is a crime of an heinous nature, and &s;everely puni&s;hable, YET TRUE IT IS, AND OF VERITY, That the &s;ame Maurice Margarot has pre&s;umed to commit, and is guilty actor, or art and part of &s;aid crime: IN SO FAR AS, the &s;aid Maurice Margarot having been named a delegate by an a&s;&s;ociation of &s;e|ditious people, calling them&s;elves the Corre&s;ponding Society of London, did repair to Edinburgh with the wicked and felonious purpo&s;e of joining and co-operating with an illegal a&s;&s;ociation of evil di&s;po&s;ed and &s;editious per&s;ons, who originally de&s;igned them&s;elves, The General Convention of the friends of the peo|ple; but who have of late a&s;&s;umed the de&s;ignation of <Q>the Bri|ti&s;h Convention of the delegates of the people, a&s;&s;ociated to obtain univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual parliaments;</Q> and which illegal a&s;&s;ociation, under the names and de&s;ignations above mentioned, have been in the practice, during the months of October and November la&s;t, as well as in the beginning of the pre&s;ent month of December, 1793, of holding various &s;editious and illegal meet|ings at a Ma&s;on's lodge, or room in Black-fryars wynd, in the city of Edinburgh, and el&s;ewhere, to the public pro&s;ecutor un|known; and which meetings, though held under pretence of procuring a reform in parliament, were evidently of a dange|rous and de&s;tructive tendency, with a deliberate and determined intention, to di&s;turb the peace of the community, and to &s;ubvert the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of the country: with which view they imitated, both in the form and tenor of their proceedings, that Convention of people, the avowed enemies of this country, who at pre&s;ent u&s;urp the government of France, and with whom Great-Britain then was and &s;till is at war: That the &s;aid Mau|rice

Margarot, from his arrival in Edinburgh, did, as a delegate from the &s;aid Corre&s;ponding Society, in London, con&s;tantly at|tend the illegal meetings of the above mentioned a&s;&s;ociation, and did co-operate with them, on different occa&s;ions, and act as pre|&s;es or chairman of their meetings, and did take an active and di&s;tingui&s;hed part in their deliberations and proceedings; and that while the &s;aid Maurice Margarot continued to attend the &s;aid illegal meetings, as a delegate, or was officiating in the ca|pacity of pre&s;ident, as above mentioned, various &s;editious and inflammatory votes and re&s;olutions were pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ome of which he moved, others of which he &s;econded, and to all of which he gave his concurrence and approbation, by voting for pa&s;&s;ing the &s;ame; and which &s;editions votes and re&s;olutions, as al&s;o the inflam|matory &s;peeches that were delivered on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, by au|thority of the &s;aid meetings, were in&s;erted in minutes of their procedure, taken at the time, and which afterwards by their order, or under their authority, were publi&s;hed in a new&s;paper, called the Edinburgh Gazetteer, of Tue&s;day, November 26th, 1793, being No. 78; of Tue&s;day, December 3d, 1793, being No. 79; and of Tue&s;day, December the 10th, 1793, being No. 80, all of that paper; and were by that means circulated among the lieges; That the &s;aid Maurice Margarot did al&s;o, when attending in his capacity of delegate at the illegal meetings of the &s;aid a&s;&s;o|ciation, utter and make various &s;editious and inflammatory &s;peeches, tending to vilify our pre&s;ent happy con&s;titution, and to withdraw therefrom the confidence and attachment of our &s;ubjects; and did likewi&s;e move re&s;olutions, tending to di&s;&s;emi|nate the &s;editious and uncon&s;titutional principles, by which the&s;e meetings were actuated. And particularly the &s;aid Maurice Margarot, at a meeting of the &s;aid Convention, held on Tue&s;day 19th of November la&s;t, 1793, or on &s;ome other day of that month, in a Ma&s;on lodge, or room in Black-fryars wynd, in the city of Edinburgh, did wickedly and feloniou&s;ly make the following mo|tion, or one of a &s;imilar import; <Q>That previous to the pub|li&s;hing an addre&s;s to the public, a Committee be forthwith ap|pointed, to con&s;ider the means and draw up the outlines of a plan of general union and corporation between the two na|tions, in their con&s;titutional pur&s;uit of a thorough parliamen|tary reform.</Q> Which motion, or one of the &s;ame tendency, having been approved of, was pa&s;&s;ed unanimou&s;ly by the &s;aid illegal a&s;&s;ociation; and which motion clearly demon&s;trated a wi&s;h and intention, on the part of the &s;aid Maurice Margarot, of propagating the &s;editious tenets of that a&s;&s;ociation over the whole kingdom, and of exciting our &s;ubjects in England, in contempt of legal authority, to adopt the &s;ame uncon&s;titutional conduct which the &s;aid Maurice Margarot and his a&s;&s;ociates had pre&s;umed to follow.</P>
<P>And further, on Monday, the 25th of November 1793, or on &s;ome other day of that month, another illegal meeting, of the
<PB N="5" REF="027594_0005_0FD54D2B17C0CF80">
above-named a&s;&s;ociation, held at the afore&s;aid Ma&s;on lodge or room, in Black-fryars wind, or in &s;ome other place to the public pro&s;ecutor unknown; upon a motion being made in the follow|ing words, or words of the &s;ame import: <Q>That in ca&s;e the mi|ni&s;ter, or any other member, bring into the Hou&s;e of Com|mons a motion for a Convention Bill, as pa&s;&s;ed in Ireland, for preventing the people from meeting according to their ju&s;t rights by the revolution, the &s;ame motion &s;hall be noticed to the delegates of the re&s;pective &s;ocieties immediately to meet in Convention, to a&s;&s;ert their rights;</Q> which motion having become the &s;ubject of con&s;ideration the following day, the &s;aid Maurice Margarot did then wickedly and feloniou&s;ly utter and make the following &s;peech, or one of the like import and ten|dency: <Q>This is an excellent motion, and the event, which it alludes to, ought to be the <HI>toc&s;in</HI> to the friends of liberty to a&s;&s;emble. It &s;eems however to be imperfect: it does not mention any place of meeting, neither does it &s;pecify the time when the delegates are to a&s;&s;emble; for the word immediately is indefinite, and will not convey the &s;ame meaning to per|&s;ons re&s;iding in different parts of the country. By tho&s;e who live near to the place of meeting it will be under&s;tood, that they are to repair there next day. By tho&s;e at a greater di&s;|tance, within a few days; and by tho&s;e &s;till further off, a week after &s;uch information is received. But the Committee of regulations have in their report an article of the &s;ame pur|port, which, in my opinion, is preferable to our friend Cal|lendar's motion; which, as this motion comes properly under the charge of regulations, I wi&s;h that it were referred to that committee. I therefore move that the report be read, that the Convention may judge whether the article I allude to &s;uf|ficiently provides for the intention of the motion now before the Convention.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I believe that the Convention will be convinced, that the clau&s;e of the report of the Committee of regulations compre|hends the &s;pirit and intention of <HI>Citizen</HI> Callendar's motion, and al&s;o extends farther, ina&s;much as it provides for a num|ber of ca&s;es equally dangerous to liberty, as a Convention Bill; it will be found al&s;o, that this bu&s;ine&s;s of calling a meeting of the Convention had better be entru&s;ted to a &s;elect Committee, appointed for the particular purpo&s;e of watching every act which may militate again&s;t the rights of the people. And I maintain that the proper place for this motion to appear is among the regulations of the Convention.</Q></P>
<P>And further, on the 28th day of the &s;aid month of November, 1793, or upon one or other of the days above mentioned, the &s;aid illegal and &s;editious meeting did, after di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid motion, in the room or Ma&s;on lodge in Black-fryars wynd afore|&s;aid, wickedly and &s;editiou&s;ly come to the re&s;olution of the fol|lowing import and tenor: <Q>That this Convention con&s;idering
<PB N="6" REF="027594_0006_0FD9B83288EBCC58">
the calamitous con&s;equences of any act of the legi&s;lature which may tend to deprive the whole or any part of the people of their undoubted right to meet, either by them&s;elves, or by delegation, to di&s;cu&s;s any matter relative to their common intere&s;t, whether of a public or private nature; and holding the &s;ame to be totally incon&s;i&s;tent with the fir&s;t principles and &s;afety of &s;ociety, and al&s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of our known and acknow|ledged con&s;titutional liberties, do hereby declare, before God and the World, that we &s;hall follow the whole&s;ome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which &s;hall militate again&s;t the con&s;titution of our Country, and &s;hall continue to a&s;&s;emble and con&s;ider of the be&s;t means by which we can accompli&s;h a real repre&s;entation of the people and an|nual election, until compelled to de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperior force.</Q></P>
<Q><P>And we do re&s;olve,</P>
<P>That the fir&s;t notice given for the introduction of a Con|vention Bill, or any Bill of a &s;imilar tendency to that pa&s;&s;ed in Ireland in the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament;</P>
<P>Or any Bill for the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the <HI>Habeas Corpus Act,</HI> or the act for preventing wrongous impri&s;onment, and again&s;t undue delays in trials in North Britain;</P>
<P>Or in ca&s;e of an Inva&s;ion,</P>
<P>Or the admi&s;&s;ion of any troops what&s;oever into Great Bri|tain or Ireland&mdash;all or any of the&s;e calamitous circum&s;tances &s;hall be a &s;ignal to the different delegates to repair to &s;uch place as the &s;ecret committee of this Convention &s;hall appoint, and the fir&s;t &s;even members &s;hall have power to declare the &s;ittings permanent, and twenty-one &s;hall con&s;titute a Conven|tion and proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Convention doth therefore re&s;olve, that each delegate, immediately upon his return home, do convene his con&s;titu|ents and explain to them the nece&s;&s;ity of electing a delegate or delegates, and of e&s;tabli&s;hing a fund without delay again&s;t any of the&s;e emergencies, for his or their expence, and that they do in&s;truct the &s;aid delegate or delegates to hold them|&s;elves ready to depart at one hour's warning.</P>
<P>And further the &s;aid Maurice Margarot did at the &s;aid ille|gal meeting after the afore&s;aid re&s;olution was &s;o pa&s;&s;ed wick|edly and feloniou&s;ly make a motion in the following words, or in words of a &s;imilar import and tendency: That a &s;ecret committee of three and the &s;ecretary be appointed to deter|mine the place where &s;uch Convention of emergency &s;hall meet; that &s;uch place &s;hall remain a &s;ecret with them and with the &s;ecretary of this Convention; and that each delegate &s;hall at the breaking up of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, be intru&s;ted with a &s;ealed letter, containing the name of the place of meeting. This letter &s;hall be delivered unopened to his con&s;tituents, the receipt of which &s;hall be acknowledged by a letter to the &s;ecretary, pre&s;erved in the &s;ame &s;tate until the pe|riod
<PB N="7" REF="027594_0007_0FD54D2EE3D04A08">
&s;hall arrive at which it &s;hall be deemed nece&s;&s;ary for the delegate to &s;et off&mdash;which motion was unanimou&s;ly approved of.&mdash;</P></Q>
<P>And further, the &s;aid Maurice Margarot did, on Wedne&s;day the 4th of December, 1793, or on one or other of the days of that month, or November preceding, in another illegal meeting of the above-named A&s;&s;ociation, held at the afore&s;aid Ma&s;on Lodge, or room in blackfryar's-wynd, or &s;ome other place to the public Pro&s;ecu|tor unknown, wickedly and feloniou&s;ly utter and make the fol|lowing &s;peech, or one of a &s;imilar import and tendency:</P>
<P><Q>Your committee of Regulations have not been able to bring forward the remainder of their report this evening, they have not however been idle, they have been employed in another manner in your &s;ervice. It has been ob&s;erved that we admit &s;pies, under the name of &s;trangers. I &s;ay they are welcome; and if the men by whom they are employed, were to come here, they &s;hould be welcome al&s;o: for we have no &s;ecrets which we dare not avow. But the intelligence which I have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> communicate will &s;hew that tho&s;e who are not friendly to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and who have an intere&s;t in &s;upporting the exi&s;ting <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> are u&s;ing every endeavour to put a &s;top to our meet|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. If they abide by law we are &s;afe; for they cannot deny <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> we are met for a legal and con&s;titutional purpo&s;e; but as the people in power may take mea&s;ures again&s;t us not war|ranted by law, we ought to be prepared. I have in my hand the outlines of a motion which I would wi&s;h to propo&s;e in a fuller hou&s;e. However I &s;hall in the mean time ob&s;erve, that I am informed there are many men who are de&s;irous of di&s;|per&s;ing us by force, we ought therefore to prepare again&s;t &s;uch di&s;per&s;ion. We have already appointed a &s;ecret commit|tee, for fixing a place of meeting on certain emergencies: and we ought to be equally well provided again&s;t the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; for if we &s;hall happen to be di&s;per&s;ed to night, how or where are we to rally again? To do this your Committee &s;ugge&s;ts a re&s;olution to the following effect; but which I &s;hall leave to be drawn up by the Council of the table: That the moment of any illegal di&s;per&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Convention &s;hall be con&s;idered as a &s;ummons to the Delegates to repair to the place of meeting, appointed for the Convention of Emer|gency by the &s;ecret committee; and that the &s;ecret committee is in&s;tructed to proceed without delay to fix the place of meet|ing. I hope that what has been already &s;aid will convince the Convention that your Committee of Regulations, though they have not been able to bring forward their report, have not neglected their duty; and it will convince our enemies that we do not altogether neglect them, they will &s;ee that we proceed with regularity, and that we have an eye upon them while they have &s;pies upon us. I therefore move for leave to bring in this motion&mdash;Which motion afterward pa&s;&s;ed unani|mou&s;ly.</Q>
<PB N="8" REF="027594_0008_0FD9B82F89157080">
&mdash;The &s;aid Maurice Margarot, after moving the &s;aid re&s;olution, not only gave his a&s;&s;ent to pa&s;s the &s;ame, but al|lowed him&s;elf to be named one of the four members of which &s;aid &s;ecret Committee was compo&s;ed, and agreed to act in that capacity. And further, on Friday, December 6th, 1793, or &s;ome other day of that month, the &s;aid illegal a&s;&s;ociation having again a&s;&s;embled in a room or work&s;hop belonging to, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by John Laing, wright, &s;ituated in Lady Law&s;on's yard, &s;outh &s;ide of Cro&s;s Cau&s;eway, in the pari&s;h of St. Cuthbert and &s;heriffdom of Edinburgh; the Sheriff Sub&s;titute of Edinburgh, with others his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, having, in the di&s;charge of his duty, repair|ed to the &s;aid room or work&s;hop, with a view to di&s;per&s;e &s;aid il|legal A&s;&s;ociation, the &s;aid Maurice Margarot, with others his a&s;&s;ociates, did then and there re&s;i&s;t the &s;aid Sheriff Sub&s;titute, and did peremptorily refu&s;e to di&s;per&s;e until forced &s;o to do: that on this occa&s;ion the &s;aid Maurice Margarot was called to the chair, and acted as pre&s;es or chairman of the &s;aid illegal meeting after the appearance of the Sheriff Sub&s;titute; and, in open con|tempt and defiance of all legal authority, vindicated the proceed|ings of the meeting, and peremptorily refu&s;ed to leave the chair unle&s;s compul&s;ion was u&s;ed: in con&s;equence of which the She|riff Sub&s;titute was under the nece&s;&s;ity of taking him by the arm and pulling him out of the chair, and of u&s;ing force in di&s;per&s;ing the re&s;t of his a&s;&s;ociates: That this conduct of the &s;aid Maurice Margarot was highly aggravated by this circum&s;tance: That the &s;aid illegal a&s;&s;ociation had been the very evening before di&s;|per&s;ed by the civil magi&s;trate. And the &s;aid Maurice Margarot having been apprehended and brought before Harry David&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Sheriff Sub&s;titute of the &s;hire of Edinburgh, on the 5th of December, 1793, did in his pre&s;ence emit a declaration of that date, which is &s;igned by the &s;aid Sheriff Sub&s;titute, the &s;aid Maurice Margarot having declined to &s;ign the &s;ame; and when the &s;aid Maurice Margarot had been &s;o apprehended, &s;undry papers hav|ing been found in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or claimed by him, the &s;ame were afterwards in&s;pected in his pre&s;ence, by authority of the Sheriff of Edinburgh, and two &s;everal li&s;ts or inventories of tho&s;e papers were made up, one of which, containing ten articles, is &s;ub&s;cribed by William Scott, procurator fi&s;cal of the county of Edinburgh, and by Jo&s;eph Gerrald, of Hart-&s;treet, Bloom&s;bu|ry Square, London; and the other, con&s;i&s;ting of nine articles, is &s;ub&s;cribed by the &s;aid William Scott, and by the Sheriff Sub&s;ti|tute of Edinburgh, as the &s;aid Maurice Margarot refu&s;ed to &s;ign the &s;ame. Which inventories, together with the whole articles thereof, except No. 1. of the fir&s;t inventory; as al&s;o the fore|&s;aid declaration emitted by him before the Sheriff Sub&s;titute of Edinburgh; together with a paper &s;igned by the &s;aid Maurice Margarot and by John Wardlaw, quoted on the back, "Motion of M. Margarot," and &s;igned by the &s;aid Sheriff Sub&s;titute, as re|lative to the afore&s;aid declaration; as al&s;o the &s;croll or draught of the minutes of the &s;aid General Convention, from the 20th of

<SPEAKER>MR. <HI>MARGAROT.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Clerk of the Court, where is the Lord Ju&s;tice General of Scotland? I don't &s;ee him in his place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P> I don't know where he is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Margarot.</SPEAKER>
<P> I hold that this Court is not competent to try me. My Lords, I am cited before the Lord Ju&s;tice General of Scotland, the Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk, and Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Ju&s;ticiary. Now we know this is the highe&s;t court in Scotland: we know there is no higher office in Scotland, than that of Lord Ju&s;tice General, and we know, that if it was an unnece&s;&s;ary po&s;t, it would not have &pound;.2,000 a year &s;alary, annexed to it, and we know that the indictment would have run before our Lord Ju&s;tice General, or Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk, becau&s;e we know that the Public Pro&s;ecutor will in this ca&s;e and in every other, trumpet up much the con&s;titution; and as the con&s;titution of Great Britain is founded upon Laws, and tho&s;e Laws can only be delivered in words, &s;o the lea&s;t variation of words in a Law, is a total ob|jection to an indictment. My Lords, it may be &s;aid there is precedent for it; but it is a fundamental principle, that no man is to hold out his own laches. Why is he not here to do his duty? If this innovation is &s;uffered, perhaps the attendance of the Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk will be di&s;pen&s;ed with, and the attendance of the other Judges; and at la&s;t, perhaps, the Clerk of the Court, or even the Macers, will form the high Court of Ju&s;ticiary, &s;o that by one deviation and another, even the forms of ju&s;tice will be done away; and, my Lords, we cannot &s;ay that there has not been a precedent, where the Lord Ju&s;tice General has appeared in his place, though perhaps that was not to the honour of Scotland, where the Duke of Argyle &s;at as Lord Ju&s;tice General, for the purpo&s;e of trying a man, one James Stewart, for the murder of a man of the name of Campbell, and the whole jury were Camp|bells except two; and that was the only in&s;tance where the Scotch have enjoyed the privilege of having the Lord Ju&s;tice General &s;it in their Court. I deny even the competency of this Court to argue upon, or maintain their own competency, be|cau&s;e it is the &s;ervant pretending to dictate to the ma&s;ter. As
<PB N="13" REF="027594_0013_0FD9B855C1039138">
well may it be &s;aid, we don't want a King, as for the Lord Ju&s;|tice Clerk to &s;ay, we don't want a Lord Ju&s;tice General.</P>
<P>I have met the laws, and I beg this may be taken under your &s;erious con&s;ideration, for what I &s;ay this day will not be confined within the&s;e walls, it &s;hall &s;pread far and wide, and will undergo a revi&s;ion of both Hou&s;es of Parliament in England. You al|ready know that there is an impeachment hanging over your heads&mdash;you know it is &s;hortly promi&s;ed to be brought forward. And, my Lords, I object upon another ground, in the criminality of which you are all implicated, for there is this difference be|tween the lieges and the judges, that a man is always pre&s;umed innocent till he is found guilty; but the moment there is the &s;lighte&s;t imputation upon a judge, he is pre&s;umed to be criminal till his innocence is clearly proved. A judge ought to be like Cae&s;ar's wife, nor only &s;potle&s;s but even un&s;u&s;pected: that is not the ca&s;e with you, my Lords. We have the promi&s;e of many men in England of great re&s;pectability who will bring it for|ward, and you may, though you are now &s;itting upon that bench, be brought to atone upon your knees, perhaps with your lives, for any infraction of the Laws you may be guilty of. My Lords, we well know that Camby&s;es ordered an unju&s;t judge to be flea'd, and the &s;kin of that judge covered the &s;eat of his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or. We al&s;o know, that in the reign of Alfred (and I hold my authority in my hand, and the hi&s;tory of England will fur|ni&s;h it to every one) that in one year, forty-four judges were hanged&mdash;and you well know the fate of Jefferys, who, though the &s;low hand of the law could not overtake him, was torn in pieces by the people. I don't mean to &s;ay that you are guilty&mdash; that remains for a higher deci&s;ion than mine, at that tribunal where you mu&s;t &s;oon appear, to an&s;wer for tho&s;e actions which you have committed; but you will remember, that there will be at that day a mixture of guilt and innocence&mdash;may the innocence appear predominant&mdash;I don't wi&s;h to be one of your accu&s;ers on that day.</P>
<P>My Lords, the objection that I have &s;tated, it is impo&s;&s;ible to get over, for that man is remarkably accurate, I mean the public Pro&s;ecutor, and if it was not nece&s;&s;ary, he would not have in|&s;erted it. I expect no mercy from him, neither &s;hall I expect any thing like mercy from the court, in the &s;ituation in which I &s;tand, if what I have heard be true.</P>
<P>My Lords, there is another objection al&s;o&mdash;I need Lord Ju&s;|tice Clerk and Lord Henderland's te&s;timonies, as exculpatory evidences: I wanted to bring them upon their oaths to the bar, but though it is the privilege of an Engli&s;hman&mdash;of a Briton I mean, for I wi&s;h the name of Engli&s;hman to be annihilated in that of Briton&mdash;it is a privilege granted to us by that Con&s;titu|tion (which is &s;o loudly trumpeted up upon every occa&s;ion), that a pannel at the bar, &s;hall have the &s;ame compul&s;ory method of bringing his witne&s;&s;es that his pro&s;ecutor has, and that has
<PB N="14" REF="027594_0014_0FD9B85CDCA18760">
been denied me. The man who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to cite witne&s;&s;es &s;aid, he would attend in court, and give his rea&s;ons why he did not dare to &s;erve tho&s;e judges with a citation. It is true, I men|tioned only the Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk to him, and I charged him to tell the Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk that I wanted his evidence, and I apprehend that you are not competent to determine upon this objection. I have obeyed the laws. This is not the high Court of Ju&s;ticiary, ina&s;amuch as it lacks the centre &s;tone&mdash;ina&s;much as it lacks the principal officer of the court, and the man who here &s;hould repre&s;ent the King, and con&s;equently the wording of the indictment is loo&s;e, and renders it null and void. I have done my duty, and I demand to be di&s;charged from your bar &s;im|pliciter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P> What do your Lord&s;hips &s;ay to this ob|jection?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Henderland.</SPEAKER>
<P> My Lords, the objection as I under&s;tand it, is, that the Lord Ju&s;tice General does not attend this court, and it is even &s;aid, that we are not competent to judge of the force and validity of that objection. Why, my Lord, with re&s;pect to that, if we are not competent to judge of it, who is to judge of it? It is from the nece&s;&s;ity of things that we mu&s;t judge of it&mdash; no other per&s;on can judge of it, and therefore I hold that objec|tion to be null and void. With re&s;pect to the attendance of the Lord Ju&s;tice General&mdash;by Act of Parliament it is declared, that any three of this court &s;hall be a quorum to try any criminal; con&s;equently, though my Lord Ju&s;tice General is ab&s;ent, and even if your Lord&s;hips and I were ab&s;ent, any other members of the court provided there are three, is a legal quorum &s;ufficient for the trial; therefore I am of opinion that the objection &s;hould be repelled.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Margarot.</SPEAKER>
<P> With regard to the libel, if any exactne&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary in a criminal libel, it certainly is not relevant, and here is one thing, that alone is &s;ufficient to qua&s;h it. But, my Lord, I de&s;ired that my witne&s;&s;es might be called over, in order that I might have a fair and free trial, that if any of them did not at|tend, I might have a caption granted by the court; and that is an objection which is not to be done away &s;o ea&s;ily. I have not heard the an&s;wer of the court to that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P> Have you any arguments to offer as to the relevancy of the indictment? if you have, you mu&s;t mention them now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Margarot.</SPEAKER>
<P> If your Lord&s;hips will give me leave to &s;tate the objection about the witne&s;&s;es afterwards, then I &s;ay, this libel &s;tates, that by the Laws of this Realm, Sedition is a crime of a heinous nature. I be&s;eech your Lord&s;hip, to point out the Law which makes Sedition a crime, and al&s;o, that which &s;hews the puni&s;hment that is due to it. I under&s;tand that &s;ome people think Sedition &s;o well under&s;tood, as not to need explanation. I differ from them&mdash;I &s;ay it is not merely the authority of a judge that is &s;ufficient&mdash;he mu&s;t lay his finger upon the Law Book and point it out to the Subjects, that they may know where to find it when they are not before the judge. Is there any Law in the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, which points out Sedition, and affixes the puni&s;hment to it?</P>
<P>My Lords, in page three of the indictment are the&s;e words, which I under&s;tand to be taken from the Gazetteer. This is an excellent motion, and the event which it alludes to, ought to be the toc&s;in to the friends of liberty to a&s;&s;emble. In the Gazetteer it is, the friends <HI>to</HI> liberty&mdash;here it is the friends <HI>of</HI> liberty. Therefore, that <HI>is</HI> a flaw in the indictment, which qua&s;hes it at once.</P>
<P>My Lords, if you go according to ju&s;tice, the&s;e are valid objec|tions; but if you think proper to repel them&mdash;if it is only to &s;tate an objection, and as &s;oon as &s;tated it is repelled, you may
<PB N="16" REF="027594_0016_0FD9B85E106C29A0">
do as you think fit; but, if I have not impartial ju&s;tice done me, I will &s;it down, not make any defence, but de&s;ire you to di&s;band the jury, and pa&s;s &s;entence.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P> Have you any thing further to &s;ay as to the relevancy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Margarot.</SPEAKER>
<P> It is irrelevant in toto. Then, my Lords, again, at the conclu&s;ion of this libel I come back with my fir&s;t objection &mdash;I &s;ee at the beginning and the end, and it is not a mere matter of form&mdash;no Act of Parliament can do it away, or if an Act of Parliament can do it away, why is not the Letter, as well as the Spirit of the Act maintained. It &s;ays here, all which, or part thereof, being found proven by the verdict of an a&s;&s;ize be|fore our Lord Ju&s;tice General, Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk, and Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Ju&s;ticiary. It &s;ays &s;o at the beginning&mdash;it &s;ays &s;o at the end. My Lords, this is an inaccuracy that cannot be overlooked, it mu&s;t not be overlooked; and, as you thought pro|per to repel it in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, I urge it again in the &s;econd; it is a flaw in the indictment. There are three flaws, which I think &s;ufficient to qua&s;h the indictment entirely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P> Have you any more objections to make?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Margarot.</SPEAKER>
<P> No, my Lords, three are as good as three thou&s;and.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Solicitor General.</SPEAKER>
<P> My Lords, in an&s;wer to what has fallen from the Pannel, his objections are &s;o extravagant as hardly to merit an an&s;wer. The only appearance of any thing like a legal objection is this: the gentleman &s;ays he is accu&s;ed of Sedition, and calls upon us to point out where Sedition is made a crime, and by what Law, and what is the puni&s;hment affixed to it. My an&s;wer to that is, that Sedition was made a crime not by any &s;tatute, but by the common Law of Scotland, and if the gentle|man wi&s;hes for authority, I refer him to the book called Regiam Maje&s;tatem, where Sedition is expre&s;sly &s;tated to be a crime, and I would tell him, that it is there declared to be puni&s;hable as trea&s;on. That is in the olde&s;t book that we have upon the Law of Scotland. Since that, Sedition has not been puni&s;hed as trea|&s;on, but remained upon the footing of the common Law, pu|ni&s;hable by what is called an arbitrary puni&s;hment. As to a de|finition of Sedition, your Lord&s;hip knows there are many crimes of &s;o complex and &s;o vague a nature, that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to give a general definition to comprehend them all. If I am called upon to give a definition of high trea&s;on, I don't know any that I could give, except by enumerating all the different ca&s;es of trea&s;on; or, &s;uppo&s;e I was called upon to give a definition of fal&s;ehood or forgery, there are twenty different kinds of it; no definition can comprehend the whole. So al&s;o, I imagine it &s;tands with regard to Sedition. At the &s;ame time, if a definition is wanted of the crime charged again&s;t that gentleman, I will read him Mr. Er&s;kine's definition of it in his fir&s;t In&s;titute: He divides it into two parts, real Sedition and verbal Sedition: he
<PB N="17" REF="027594_0017_0FD54D40552D10F8">
&s;ays, real Sedition is generally committed by convocating toge|ther a con&s;iderable number of people without lawful authority, under pretence of redre&s;&s;ing grievances to the de&s;troying of the public peace. Then he &s;ays, general Sedition is inferred from the convocation of a number of people without lawful authority, tending to di&s;turb the peace of the community. Is not this the very crime charged again&s;t this gentleman? if there was any lawful authority, the gentleman will tell us what it is. Can there be a doubt, that if the facts &s;tated in this indictment be true, they not only tended to di&s;turb the peace of the country, but to &s;ubvert the Con&s;titution of Great Britain. Therefore, taking the charge as it &s;tands, there cannot be a doubt with any of your Lord&s;hips that it does amount to a charge of Sedition, and that Sedition is a crime puni&s;hable by the Law of this country? If there is any other country in the world, where Sedition is not made a crime by the common Law, I wi&s;h the&s;e gentlemen next time they hold Briti&s;h Conventions would meet in that country, for in Scotland, I will a&s;&s;ure them, there is a Law to puni&s;h them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Margarot.</SPEAKER>
<P> My Lords, I hold in my hand a definition of Mr. Er&s;kine's, a little differing from what the gentleman has read; he &s;ays, <Q>it con&s;i&s;ts in rai&s;ing commotions or di&s;turbances in the &s;tate; it is either verbal or real. Verbal Sedition or Lea&s;ing making, is inferred from the uttering of words, tend|ing to create di&s;cord between the king and his people,</Q> and I think it is that gentleman who is guilty of Sedition, ina&s;much as he &s;eeks to alienate the hearts of the &s;ubjects from their &s;ove|reign. He &s;ays, <Q>it was formerly puni&s;hed by death and the forfeiture of goods, but now either by impri&s;onent, fine, or bani&s;hment, at the di&s;cretion of the judge.</Q> Now it &s;eems to me, that that cannot be the Sedition which this gentleman means, for if I under&s;tand rightly, the Sedition I am charged with, is &s;omething like that of Me&s;&s;rs. Muir, Palmer, and Skir|ving. Now if their Sedition had been the Sedition that is meant here, they would have been puni&s;hed by bani&s;hment and not by tran&s;portation; and therefore, there mu&s;t have been &s;ome trif|ling mi&s;take in that, my Lords. Now it &s;ays here, <Q>for pre|venting riots and tumults it is enacted, that if any per&s;ons to the number of twelve &s;hall a&s;&s;emble, and being required by a magi&s;trate or con&s;table to di&s;per&s;e, &s;hall neverthele&s;s continue together for an hour after &s;uch command, the per&s;ons di&s;obey|ing &s;hall &s;uffer death.</Q> Therefore, that cannot be the Sedi|tion that I am charged with, for the indictment only pretends to know, what I am &s;ure the Almighty never commi&s;&s;ioned the Lord Advocate to enquire into, namely, our &s;ecret intentions. I did not know before that there was an inqui&s;ition in Scotland, and that he was Grand Inqui&s;itor; for certainly otherwi&s;e, the minds of the people are only to be gathered from their behaviour.</P>
<P>My Lords, the&s;e meetings I will maintain were legal in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word; for the claim of rights entitles the
<PB N="18" REF="027594_0018_0FD9B85F99AFF938">
people to petition Parliament; and it is impo&s;&s;ible they could petition Parliament without meeting. The general will cannot be collected as you gather taxes from door to door. Good God! what has become of the Con&s;titution that you trumpet up &s;o much, if you give us the name and take away the e&s;&s;ence? if the people are not to meet to examine their rights, and proceed upon their rights.</P>
<P>My Lords, there is not one &s;o barefaced as to pretend to deny our right to petition or addre&s;s the King. The Lord Advocate him&s;elf has acknowledged, that it is our right. He him&s;elf is a reformer, and has held &s;editious meetings as well as us; but then indeed he brings forward a curious rea&s;on: when the Lord Advocate is out of place, reform is proper; when in place, it is highly improper; and that is the doctrine of Mr. Pitt. Be|cau&s;e we are poor, it is &s;edition in us; but when your County Meetings are held, it is no longer &s;edition; but it is a thing that is authorized. As long as they thought we were not &s;ufficiently formidable, and that there was no danger of opening the eyes of the people, &s;o long did Ju&s;tice nod; and &s;he only awoke when every man, hearing &s;o much talk of the Con&s;titution, began to examine what that Con&s;titution was. And, to be &s;ure, it is a curious fiction in law (and you have a great many) by which our happy con&s;titution has wi&s;ely guarded the Pro&s;ecutor for the Crown; by which means the &s;ubject may at any time be oppre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted by the officer of the Crown, and he can obtain no damages, no redre&s;s whatever. Happy if he gets off; happy if his &s;entence does not come out of the pocket of a Mini&s;ter of State. My Lords, our tran&s;actions have been legal. The illegal actions have been entirely on the part of our pro&s;e|cutors. We have experienced the fate of general warrants: we have experienced the fate of a State Inqui&s;ition. Good God! has not a man, living under the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, a right to examine that con&s;titution, and to &s;ay, I am told, that it is the fine&s;t in&s;titution in the world; and yet I feel my pocket emptied daily with taxes; I feel my liberties taken away one after ano|ther; and yet I mu&s;t not meet with my neighbours to the num|ber of twelve, to di&s;cu&s;s tho&s;e injuries that I daily feel, and to enquire after the means of obtaining redre&s;s, but immediately comes a Crown Lawyer, claps the word Sedition upon it, and I am puni&s;hed. Then another man is charged with Sedition. My ca&s;e is brought forward as a precedent, and therefore he mu&s;t be puni&s;hed in the &s;ame way.

&s;eek a re&s;titution of our rights, a renovation of our Con&s;titution, as it is &s;aid here, by univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual parliaments.</P>
<P>My Lords, perhaps your memories may fail you, for it is &s;ome time back when Mr. Pitt, at the Thatched Hou&s;e Tavern, being a young man making his debut in Parliament, a young patriot making his entr&eacute;e into the world, in&s;i&s;ted upon a reform. It was then highly con&s;titutional. My Lords, I have in my hand a re&s;o|lution entered into at the Thatched Hou&s;e Tavern, on the 16th of May, 1782: <Q>At a numerous and re&s;pectable meeting of Members of Parliament, friendly to a con&s;titutional Reformation, and of members of &s;everal Committees of Counties and Cities.</Q> Here, Gentlemen, you &s;ee Delegates, here you &s;ee a Convention; though a Convention is nothing new in Scotland; becau&s;e you have had the Borough Reform Convention, and the Lord Advo|cate is him&s;elf upon that li&s;t. My Lords, at the Thatched Hou&s;e Tavern were pre&s;ent the Duke of Richmond, Lord Surrey, Lord Mahon, the Lord Mayor. Here you &s;ee among&s;t them the fir&s;t municipal officer in England, the Lord Mayor, Sir Watkin Lew|es, Mr. Duncomb, Sir Cecil Wray, Mr. Brand Hollis, Mr. Wi|thers, the Hon. William Pitt, whom I mean to adduce as an ex|culpatory evidence, if even the forms of ju&s;tice are allowed me &mdash;the Reverend Mr. Wyvil, Major Cartwright, Mr. John Horne Tooke, Alderman Wilkes, Dr. Jebb, Mr. Churchill, Mr. Fro&s;t, &amp;c. &amp;c. all men of learning, who well knew what the Con&s;titu|tion of this country is, and what it ought to be&mdash;men who re|quired not to be told what was &s;edition and what was not&mdash;men who would not have ri&s;ked them&s;elves, if they had not known that they were upon con&s;titutional ground, and they re&s;olve, <Q>That the motion of the Hon. William Pitt, on the 7th in&s;tant, for the appointment of a Committee of the Hou&s;e of Commons, to enquire into the &s;tate of the repre&s;entation of the people of Great Britain, and to report the &s;ame to the Hou&s;e; and al&s;o what &s;teps it might be nece&s;&s;ary to take having been defeated by a motion for the order of the day</Q>&mdash;which is &s;omething &s;imilar to your repelling an objection of the Pannel, as &s;oon as it is &s;tated&mdash;<Q>having been defeated by a motion for the order of the day, it is become indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary that application &s;hould be made to Parliament by petitions from the collective body of the people in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts.</Q>&mdash;They were not to pour into the Hou&s;e eight millions of petitions, but as many petitions from as many di&s;tricts as they could collect together, <Q>reque&s;ting a &s;ub&s;tantial reformation of the Commons Hou&s;e of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly, That this meeting, con&s;idering that a general application, by the collective body of the people, to the Hou&s;e of Commons cannot be made before the clo&s;e of the pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion, is of opinion that the &s;en&s;e of the people &s;hould be taken.</Q> And how is the &s;en&s;e of the people to be taken, I would a&s;k the learned gentlemen of the law, if they are

<P>My Lords, it &s;eems to have been in the year 1782 a very lauda|ble and a very con&s;titutional thing to a&s;&s;emble, to meet to con|&s;ider of the grievances, and to plan a method by which they were to be redre&s;&s;ed; in the year 1794, when the very man who planned, who fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted this, who encouraged the people thereto, under his reign, I may call it, for he it the guide of the helm&mdash;the guide in the cabinet, while he is in ab&s;olute power, that &s;hall be con&s;idered as Sedition, which he him&s;elf fir&s;t &s;et on foot, in order to procure him&s;elf that birth; and, now he has got it, he has altered his &s;entiments!&mdash;How ridiculous for a Crown Lawyer to attempt to impo&s;e upon a Court of Ju&s;tice; or for any man to &s;upport &s;uch impo&s;ition, that what was con&s;titu|tional in 1782 &s;hould be criminal in 1794.&mdash;Fellow citizens, and I fear not to call you by that name&mdash;we are fellow citizens of one &s;ociety. By the word Citizen I mean a free man; a man enjoying all the rights and all the privileges, and paying his quota towards all the expence of Society. I &s;ay it is an in&s;olent attempt upon your under&s;tandings, to endeavour to per&s;uade you that that which was con&s;titutional, that that which was right, that that which was ju&s;tifiable in 1782 &s;hould be criminal in 1794. It is true that an Engli&s;h jury has &s;ent to pri&s;on a man for only reprinting tho&s;e Re&s;olutions. Holt, I think his name is, the printer of the Newark Journal, for reprinting in his paper, which pays a daily tax to government, that which the per&s;on to whom he pays the tax was the author of. Thus you &s;ee how Crown Lawyers pervert the con&s;titution. With high-&s;ounding words they di&s;gui&s;e the mo&s;t innocent facts; they &s;port with the lives, and with that which ought to be infinitely more dear than their lives&mdash;with the liberties of his Maje&s;ty's Sub|jects. Men who feel wrongs cannot feel them without &s;ome degree of acrimony, and when tho&s;e wrongs are repeated, this acrimony mu&s;t increa&s;e; and the&s;e wrongs are done them in the King's name; but it is not the King, it is his &s;ervants who make u&s;e of his name; his &s;editious &s;ervants who &s;eparate the King

<P> My Lords, we are called upon to decide upon the relevancy of this indictment, which charges in the major propo&s;ition, that the crime of &s;edition, in this and every other well governed realm, is a crime of a heinous nature, and &s;everely puni&s;hable. And, my Lord, the fir&s;t part of it (to which it might be &s;ufficient to confine my&s;elf at pre&s;ent) charges that this Society, calling them&s;elves the Briti&s;h Convention of Delegates of the People, met under the pretence of Reform; that it was of a dangerous and de&s;tructive tendency, and was with the deliberate and determined intention to di&s;turb the peace of the community, and to &s;ubvert the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of the country; and that this gentleman, Maurice Margarot, did take an active and di&s;tingui&s;hing part in their deliberations; and con|&s;equently, that he took an active and di&s;tingui&s;hing part in the deliberations of a Society, met with a determined purpo&s;e to overturn the Con&s;titution; that is the charge, true or fal&s;e it is not our province at pre&s;ent to enquire; that mu&s;t be left to the Jury. The criminality does, to be &s;ure, con&s;i&s;t in, that they met with a determined purpo&s;e to overturn the Con&s;titution: and the Jury, when they come to decide upon it, mu&s;t take into their view the &s;everal things charged in this indictment, rela|tive to this meeting. As to the form that they a&s;&s;umed, how far that was nece&s;&s;ary to obtain a reform in Parliament, it is the province of the Jury to enquire; and under all the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, to lay their hands upon their heart, and upon their great oaths to &s;ay what was the purpo&s;e of that meeting, accor|ding to the facts before them. My Lord, if that is made out-which is the charge, and in con&s;idering the relevancy, I am, bound to hold the charge as proved, there cannot be a doubt that it amounts to &s;edition. I &s;ay it approaches to high trea&s;on: and I find in the ca&s;es tried in England, in 1745, it appears from Judge Fo&s;ter's Report, the charges laid again&s;t the pri&s;oners were very little different from tho&s;e contained in the pre&s;ent indictment. It ran in the&s;e terms: <Q>Al&s;o devi&s;ing and as much as in them lay mo&s;t wickedly and traiterou&s;ly intending to change and &s;ubvert the rule of government of this king|dom, duly and happily e&s;tabli&s;hed under our pre&s;ent Sovereign Lord the King, and al&s;o to depo&s;e and deprive our &s;aid pre|&s;ent
<PB N="22" REF="027594_0022_0FD54D47F5CA0118">
Sovereign Lord the King of his title,</Q> and &s;o on. Now, my Lord, the charge is, that the purpo&s;e of this meeting was to &s;ubvert the Con&s;titution; and if it was, where can the doubt be, that it does amount to Sedition. My Lord, I leave it to the &s;en&s;e of every man who hears me, if an intention to &s;ubvert the Con&s;titution of a country is not Sedition. In matters of criminal law you mu&s;t go by the under&s;tanding and the &s;en&s;e of mankind, and in this in&s;tance particularly the Jury are to determine upon the law as well as the fact.</P>
<P>My Lord, with re&s;pect to Sedition it is of various kinds; no doubt its general tendency is to re&s;i&s;t and undermine, or attempt|ing to re&s;i&s;t and undermine the Con&s;titution of the country, and &s;ubvert the &s;upreme power of the &s;tate. It may either be of a public or a private nature. When of a private nature, it is di|rected again&s;t matters of a private life, it may be in direct op|po&s;ition to acts of parliament, with re&s;pect to inclo&s;ures, divi|&s;ion of commonalties, turn pikes, and &s;o on. But of a public nature is the crime which is charged again&s;t this Gentleman: an intention to &s;ubvert the Con&s;titution. My Lord, &s;edition may be attended with tumult or without: with ri&s;ing in arms, or without ri&s;ing in arms. My Lord, &s;edition of a public kind, is as various as the ingenuity of wickedne&s;s can &s;ugge&s;t. It may be committed by words, by writing, by painting, by medals, by allegories, by actions, by fal&s;e in&s;inuation, by fal&s;e argument, by tumult and in&s;urrection, by mobs, by cabals, by open and &s;ecret meetings; by con&s;piracies and by conventions. If the Jury are &s;atisfied in their minds that the intention of this is to overturn the Con&s;titution; it is Sedition. My Lord, it was &s;aid that there was no law again&s;t this. As to that, my Lord, every well regulated government mu&s;t make it Sedition; becau&s;e otherwi&s;e &s;ociety could not exi&s;t. It always has been, and mu&s;t remain a common law crime, and mu&s;t be puni&s;hable by common law.</P>
<P>My Lord, having &s;aid &s;o much, I think there can be no doubt that the Libel is relevant. The Pannel is at liberty to &s;tate what he plea&s;es in his defence. To in&s;i&s;t it was for a partial reform by legal means, and that nothing el&s;e was meant by this extra|ordinary gui&s;e that this convention took upon them&s;elves to a&s;|&s;ume; the Jury will, upon the whole, judge whether this de|fence or whether the charge is relevant. In the mean time it is my humble opinion that it is relevant.</P>

<P> My Lord, as to the crime of Sedition, I cannot read the Indictment, nor I think any body el&s;e, and &s;ay that if this man was concerned in holding the&s;e meetings, for the pur|po&s;e of di&s;turbing the peace of the community, and &s;ubverting the con&s;titution of the country, that that is not the crime of Se|dition. My Lord, it is not the province of &s;uch men as the&s;e to take upon them&s;elves the amendment of the Government. The intention of their meeting, they &s;ay, was to obtain univer&s;al
<PB N="23" REF="027594_0023_0FD9B867EBFF2F00">
&s;uffrage; or, in other words, to e&s;tabli&s;h that every man living in this country is to have a vote to choo&s;e a Repre&s;entative in Parliament; a thing that never did obtain, and that does not now obtain, and never can obtain in this country. But, my Lord, it &s;eems that if an act &s;hould take place for the purpo&s;e of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;uch illegal meetings, that this is to be their toc&s;in, and their alarm bell for the purpo&s;e of meeting, when, where, or how, is to be kept a deep &s;ecret&mdash;it is not to be divulged even among them&s;elves; but it was to be con&s;ined to this gentleman, and two or three more, who were to call a Convention of Emer|gency, and they were to continue to a&s;&s;emble, and not to obey &s;uch act if it &s;hould pa&s;s. My Lord, if the charges in this Indict|ment are proved, it is impo&s;&s;ible to deny my a&s;&s;ent, that they do infer the crime of Sedition. I am of opinion that this libel is revelantly laid. I &s;hall be exceedingly happy, if this gentle|man is found innocent; but that lies with the Jury, and not with us.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Swinton.</SPEAKER>
<P> My Lord, the que&s;tion that is now under our con&s;ideration is, whether this libel is relevant to infer the pains of law. And, my Lord, it has been &s;o fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, not only at this time, but upon the occa&s;ion of a very late trial, that it is perfectly unnece&s;&s;ary to go over the ground again that has been already gone over. But, my Lord, in this ea&s;e the indictment, &s;tates, that a motion was made, upon which the Pannel &s;ays, <Q>This is an excellent motion. The event which it alludes to, ought to be the toc&s;in for the friends of liberty to a&s;&s;emble.</Q> My Lord, this is a very ill cho&s;en word. What is this toc&s;in? It is an in&s;trument made u&s;e by the people in France to a&s;&s;emble. It is borrowed from a place from which I would wi&s;h to borrow very little. For what purpo&s;e are they to a&s;&s;emble? They &s;ay to a&s;&s;ert their rights. By what means? can any man be at a lo&s;s to make the an&s;wer? By violence and outrage, and no other in|terpretation can be given to it. My Lord, afterwards a propo|&s;al is made for a &s;ealed letter to be given to the Delegates, which was not to be opened till a certain period: like an order that is &s;ometimes given to &s;hips when they &s;ail, that they are not to open their in&s;tructions till they come to a certain latitude; and the meaning is, that tho&s;e in&s;tructions &s;hall not be known, for fear they &s;hould be prevented. There can be no other rea|&s;on; and yet they afterwards &s;ay, we make no &s;ecrets of any thing. Then there is a re&s;olution, that this Convention, con&s;i|dering the calamitous con&s;equence of any act of the Legi&s;lature, which may tend to deprive the people of their undoubted right to meet, declare before God and the world, that we &s;hall follow the whole&s;ome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which &s;hall militate again&s;t the Con&s;titution of our coun|try. Is not this declaring that they will oppo&s;e the Legi&s;lature it&s;elf? My Lord, it does not require any proof of its being Se|dition. Then, my Lord, among other ca&s;es of emergency, on
<PB N="24" REF="027594_0024_0FD9B87CE22760B0">
which they were to meet, it is mentioned, <Q>or in ca&s;e of an in|va&s;ion.</Q> My Lord, for what purpo&s;e were they to meet pri|vately, in ca&s;e of inva&s;ion? The Legi&s;lature, the executive part of government is to look after that. Every man mu&s;t feel what they meant: that they &s;hould a&s;&s;emble the Delegates altogether at a particular time, and all at one time they &s;hould meet, in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion. My Lord, I gave my &s;entiments very fully this day &s;e'n night upon the &s;ame que&s;tion, and I have not altered them, but feel them &s;tronger and &s;tronger. I am &s;orry to &s;ee &s;o many examples brought before us, and I hope there will be but few more; I am of opinion that the libel is relevant.</P>

<P> My Lord, the only que&s;tion at pre&s;ent for our con&s;ideration is, whether the libel is relevant and is laid pro|perly. My Lord, the major propo&s;ition &s;tates the crime of Se|dition: the minor propo&s;ition &s;pecifies a variety of circum&s;tances, which, if they come up to the crime of Sedition, the libel is re+levant; and, my Lord, I have but one doubt upon this &s;ubject; and that is, whether in &s;ome of the&s;e particulars it is any thing &s;hort of the crime of high trea&s;on; but I think that it amounts to Sedition, there can be no doubt; and I think that the ordi|nary interlocutory ought to be pronounced.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Abercrombie.</SPEAKER>
<P> My Lord, in this ca&s;e, as to the objections to the relevancy it is the province of the Jury to enquire into the facts charged; and if tho&s;e facts are brought home to this Pannel; particularly the re&s;olutions, if they are brought home to him, I think the nece&s;&s;ary conclu&s;ion is, that he is guilty of the highe&s;t &s;pecies of Sedition that can be po&s;&s;ibly com|mitted. I am of opinion that the libel ought to be found re|levant.</P>

On the contrary, it appears that the letters of excul|pation found no difficulty in being backed by a Judge in Eng|land, and the &s;ubpoena was &s;erved upon them according to the laws of England; and therefore, by a &s;econd diligence, they will be pur&s;ued in the &s;ame manner; and that will be backed by a Judge, and the &s;ame compul&s;ion will be excerci&s;ed upon them in England as would be in Scotland, if they re&s;ided here.&mdash;And, my Lord, I will not permit this to be pa&s;&s;ed over ea&s;ily, they are very material evidences&mdash;they are men of high &s;tation in the &s;tate&mdash;they are men of great re&s;pon&s;ibility&mdash;they are men who&s;e actions are public, and the que&s;tions that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">

It is a legal objection, founded in ju&s;tice; and ju&s;tice cannot deny it.&mdash;Grant me a caption for my ab&s;ent witne&s;&s;es. I demand it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Henderland.</SPEAKER>
<P> My Lords, if witne&s;&s;es re&s;ided in Scotland within our juri&s;diction, and did not attend, a caption might be granted; but my doubt is, whether it is competent to the Court to grant a &s;econd diligence, becau&s;e in this ca&s;e it mu&s;t be alto|gether nugatory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord E&s;kgrove.</SPEAKER>
<P> My Lords, I don't know an in&s;tance exi&s;ting, either in the civil or criminal courts, of a warrant being granted to bring a witne&s;s from England, to apprehend him by Habeas Corpus: that is the only juri&s;diction we can exerci&s;e. My Lords, I under&s;tand in England it is not an ea&s;y matter to obtain wit|ne&s;&s;es, before their own courts; but of that I profe&s;s my&s;elf ig|norant: but I know of no in&s;tance in which this court have taken cognizance of the non-attendance of witne&s;&s;es, re&s;ident in a foreign country; for England, with re&s;pect to the law, is as much a foreign country, as Germany, Italy, or any other coun|try.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Swinton.</SPEAKER>
<P> By our laws we cannot grant a caption again&s;t a witne&s;s from a foreign country, and we cannot go beyond our power. It is clear to me, that it was not our fault that they did not attend&mdash;as to tho&s;e that are lawfully &s;ummoned here, we can lay a fine upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Dun&s;innan.</SPEAKER>
<P> My Lords, this Court ought not to be treated with contempt, and therefore your Lord&s;hips would be careful to i&s;&s;ue no warrant that you cannot enforce. The authority of this Court cannot go beyond their juri&s;diction, which is confined to Scotland.</P>

<P> By the laws of this country we have no au|thority over per&s;ons re&s;iding in any other country.&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P> We cannot po&s;&s;ibly differ upon this mat|ter;&mdash;it is a downright ab&s;urdity, to i&s;&s;ue a &s;econd diligence again&s;t witne&s;&s;es re&s;iding in another country.&mdash;I am &s;orry for it; but he has got affair trial by the laws of this country.&mdash;As to what dropped from the Pannel ju&s;t now, he mu&s;t be very much mi&s;taken, if he thinks he is tried for a crime committed in Eng|land: that is by no means the ea&s;e; he is tried for what he did after he came to this country; but it was very proper, in order to &s;hew the intention with which he came here, to &s;tate the fact, that he came as a delegate from a Convention of the &s;ame kind in England; but it is for the crime that he committed in this country alone, that he now &s;tands at the bar.</P>

<PB N="32" REF="027594_0032_0FD7BF944B51FEB8">
called upon to take the chair, which he accordingly did. Mr. Da|vid&s;on a&s;ked, if it was the Briti&s;h Convention? upon being told it was, he told them that they came for the purpo&s;e of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing them, and that they &s;hould not proceed to any bu&s;ine&s;s; the an&s;wer was, that they would not till force was u&s;ed, and parti|ticularly the Pannel &s;aid, that he would not leave the chair, as he was then di&s;charging his duty, till force was u&s;ed; to that Mr. David&s;on &s;aid, he &s;uppo&s;ed any thing that had that appear|ance would be &s;atisfactory, and took Mr. Margarot by the hand, upon which he left the chair: upon his leaving the chair, there was a call for Mr. Gerald to take the chair, which he according|ly did, and the &s;ame form was u&s;ed with regard to him: Mr. Da|vid&s;on took him by the hand, and it was then called out that they never di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without prayer, and Mr. Gerald prayed and then came out of the chair; it was then &s;aid by &s;omebody, that though they were now di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, they would remember that they were permanent, that they had voted them&s;elves per|manent the night before.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Abercrombie.</SPEAKER>
<P> I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve, that from the begin|ning of this trial, the Pannel has betrayed the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance of the laws of this country; and I mu&s;t regret that he has not had the advice of tho&s;e who know better; but if he is to object to things in this way, I tru&s;t he will do it, for his own &s;ake, in a decent manner.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand you have &s;aid that I emitted a declaration: a declaration, if I under&s;tand it rightly, is a certain verbal ac|knowledgment?</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>A declaration may be negative, and it is &s;till a declaration.</P>

<P> You may make a declaration that you are innocent as well as that you are guilty.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot &s;ay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it may happen that you may have intermixed a pa|per of Mr. Gerald's and a paper of mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; they were taken down di&s;tinctly, and marked with your own initials in your own pre&s;ence.</P>

<P>Yes; you was the fir&s;t per&s;on that called to me, handed me a motion, and de&s;ired I would read it; I told him I had no|thing to do with it: it was a motion to petition the King, or &s;omething of that kind.</P>

<P>It was on Friday evening, the 6th of December, I went and attended the Lord Provo&s;t, with the magi&s;trates of the city; a great number of people were a&s;&s;embled in a wright's &s;hop, and I went immediately up to the table, where I &s;aw &s;ome people who&s;e faces I recognized; Mr. Skirving, Mr. Brown, Mr. Margarot, and &s;everal others; I a&s;ked what the meeting was? I did not get a direct an&s;wer; I a&s;ked if it was the Briti&s;h Convention? One of the members, and I think it was Mr. Margarot, &s;aid that it was; I told him that I was Sheriff Sub&s;ti|tute for the county, and that I came there to di&s;per&s;e that meet|ing, which was an illegal one, upon this &s;ome conver&s;ation took place; and I think Mr. Margarot was the man who &s;poke mo&s;t on account of the Convention; he &s;aid, they were met peacea|bly, that it was a legal Con&s;titutional Meeting, and that they were then met for a petition to Parliament. I told him, that my re&s;olution had been taken before I came there; that I came with a determination to di&s;per&s;e that meeting; that no words were nece&s;&s;ary, no argument that they could u&s;e could alter my determination: &s;ome more conver&s;ation took place. Mr. Mar|garot, finding I was determined upon it, &s;aid that he would take the chair, with the approbation of the meeting, which was then empty; accordingly upon this, he was unanimou&s;ly called to the chair: I think before he took the chair, he &s;aid, the meeting would not di&s;per&s;e without force was u&s;ed; I told him, I hoped it would be unnece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e force, but if it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, I &s;hould certainly make u&s;e of it. He took the chair, and finding they would not di&s;per&s;e without &s;ome force, I took him by the arm, which he con&s;idered as force, and he came out of the chair; immediately upon his doing &s;o, Mr. Gerald, another of the gentlemen pre&s;ent, took the chair; I told him I really thought that it was improper that another per&s;on &s;hould do the &s;ame thing, if they were all to take the chair one after another; I hoped they would not think that nece&s;&s;ary; however I took the &s;ame method of forcing Mr. Gerald from the chair that I did Mr. Margarot: Mr. Gerald then made an extem|pore prayer, and left the chair. Mr. Margarot, among&s;t other things that he mentioned, &s;aid, the meeting of the Con|vention had declared them&s;elves permament. I told him it might be &s;o, but I was determined they &s;hould not meet within the county where I had a juri&s;diction. I think they called out for the gentlemen to di&s;per&s;e, and by degrees they di&s;per&s;ed; and I &s;aw the la&s;t per&s;on out, and &s;aw the door locked, and took the key.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far from &s;triking me as an unprecedented thing, that it &s;trikes me upon many occa&s;ions as a nece&s;&s;ary thing, pruden|tially to keep &s;ecrets of every &s;ociety when it is nece&s;&s;ary for their intere&s;t.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P> What was the drift of that Committee of Organization?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>What I conceive to be the direct de&s;ign of the Committee was to form rules, by which the Convention might regulate them&s;elves in their pre&s;ent and in their &s;ub&s;equent meetings, if they &s;hould &s;ee occa&s;ion for any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P> Do you think that the Committee of Organization did not likewi&s;e refer to the internal regulation of the Convention?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I meant to expre&s;s in my la&s;t an&s;wer, I con&s;idered the committee of Organization to refer chiefly to the internal af|fairs of the Convention, and with re&s;pect to future Conven|tions, if there &s;hould be &s;uch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P> It &s;eems that you have heard that meetings of the Con|vention were at times called &s;ittings; do you imagine that that expre&s;&s;ion was adopted as borrowed from a neighbouring country, or that is was an expre&s;&s;ion which followed of cour&s;e, and to which we are thoroughly accu&s;tomed in the Engli&s;h lan|guage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>However the reading of new&s;papers might lead us to make u&s;e of terms, I cannot &s;ay; but it was certainly a word that it was very natural to make u&s;e of.</P>

<P> That word is Latin, is it not?</P>

<P>I am very little acquainted with Latin&punc; I meant Pre&s;ident.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P> You are &s;ufficiently acquainted with it to know that at pre&s;ent Rome is the &s;eat of the Pope, are you not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have no doubt of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P> Con&s;equently if there is any criminality in adopting a French word, do you think there is not an equal criminality in u&s;ing a Latin one&punc;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e things appeared to me to be &s;o trifling, that I did not think it worth my while to make any objection to them: &s;ome were of French origin, and &s;ome of Briti&s;h, and &s;ome of La|tin; but I did not think it worth while to make any objection to it.</P>

<P>What I under&s;tand by Convention was, that they met with a &s;incere and hearty de&s;ign to promote the good of the country, by a thorough reform in the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons, and that they meant to do this by peaceable means.</P>

<P>You &s;ay it is your opinion that there are already &s;uffi|cient grounds for the good people of this country to demand a Reform in Parliament; do you think tho&s;e grounds would not be increa&s;ed by two &s;uch events as the bringing in of a Conven|tion Bill, or a motion for &s;u&s;pending the Habeas Corpus act, which is one of the greate&s;t privileges a &s;ubject of Britain en|joys, or the Bill for preventing wrongous impri&s;onment; do you think that would not make a very con&s;iderable addition to our complaints?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;atisfied in my own mind, that it would increa&s;e the grievances of the people, and be like a grave &s;tone to their li|berties.</P>

<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what light did you look upon the members of the Bri|ti&s;h Convention? Did you look upon them as a turbulent &s;et of vagabonds, or did you look upon them as a body of men dele|gated by &s;ome of their fellow &s;ubjects for a certain purpo&s;e, and that the&s;e men &s;o delegated were indu&s;trious, peaceable, cre|ditable men?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their de&s;ign, I have to rea&s;on no call in que&s;tion, was the good of their country: as to characters, there is always a mixture in all a&s;&s;emblies; but I believe, taking the whole toge|ther, there was a great degree of re&s;pectability with re&s;pect to characters.</P>
</SP>

<P>Then they did not appear to you to come under the de&s;cription of <HI>&s;wine, rabble,</HI> or <HI>wretches?</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>When is the propere&s;t time for men to a&s;&s;emble and de|liberate? It in time of danger, or pro&s;perity? It appears that the Convention was to a&s;&s;emble in this manner, in the moment that an inva&s;ion of foreign troops &s;hould take place in Great Britain. Do you conceive that to be a time of danger, and call|ing for the attention of all Britons throughout the i&s;land; or do you think it a time for them to &s;it idle and &s;uffer them&s;elves to be en&s;laved by a foreign power?</P>

<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you have any thing that intere&s;ts you very much, do you publi&s;h it all through your hou&s;e, and different parts of your family, or &s;ometimes keep a &s;ecret to your&s;elf in your pri|vate affairs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, no doubt; and every per&s;on endued with any de|gree of prudence will find occa&s;ion to keep their &s;ecrets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you had a particular piece of bu&s;ine&s;s to do, and that you was apprehen&s;ive that a &s;uperior power, inimical to your de&s;ign and to your welfare, would prevent you from doing that particular bu&s;ine&s;s at &s;uch a place, would you inform that inimi|cal power where you was to meet to do that bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>

<P>We had originally Parliaments, or &s;ome time back, Par|liaments of three years; now by an Act of Parliament they are lengthened to &s;even years; &s;uppo&s;e another Act &s;hould make them during life, and a third Act &s;hould make them hereditary, do you imagine that would be an uncon&s;titutional act?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has always &s;truck me as a thing beyond their power to alter or de&s;troy the fundamental rights of the people, or any thing that would extend their own power.</P>

<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you imagine it to be either in the Bill of Rights, or the claim of rights, expre&s;&s;ed, that the people &s;hould be at li|berty to meet to communicate to each other their grievances, and plan methods for obtaining redre&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often wi&s;hed to &s;ee the Bill of Rights, the Habeas Corpus Act, and all tho&s;e things; but I have never had it in my power; but in my opinion, the object of all government is the good of the people, and that the liberties of the people ought to be carefully guarded by them.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>It appears by what has pa&s;&s;ed here, that the Convention had &s;ome notion of a God: did they ever pray in their meetings?</P>

<SP>

<P>Did you ever &s;ee any di&s;orderly behaviour there? were they riotous or tumultuous?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the burning of the motion, you &s;aid they were not acting under the apprehen&s;ion of fear: did you &s;uppo&s;e they could ju&s;tify their proceedings?</P>

<SP>
<PB N="52" REF="027594_0052_0FD7BF9AED6809E8">

<P>Yes, long prior.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was your motive for a&s;&s;ociating with the Friends of the People?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>The public good, which I hope I will always have at heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you under&s;tand by the public good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand, by the public good, that grievances &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed, and every man made as happy as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had you any &s;pecific plan?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, we had ju&s;t two objects; the&s;e two objects were, a &s;horter duration of Parliaments, and a more frequent election of Repre&s;entatives; becau&s;e we con&s;idered the length of parlia|ments, and the &s;low return of elections, to be the two great and fundamental cau&s;es of all the grievances which the nation labours under.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>What &s;ort of men were the&s;e with whom you a&s;&s;ociated, the Friends of the People? I don't particularly mean what cla&s;s, high or low, rich or poor; but what morals, what temper, what behaviour; in &s;hort, what opinion do you form of them in ge|neral?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I con&s;idered them to be a good, moral, re&s;pectable &s;et of people; not re&s;pectable in point of riches, but in that re&s;pect which will be looked at by the all-&s;eeing-eye of the Almighty; re&s;pectable in point of morals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did they ever &s;hew any di&s;po&s;ition to trea&s;on, &s;edition, or felony?&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did it appear to you, that the Convention adhered to the &s;pirit of reform which was &s;et on foot by the Friends of the People?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>They certainly did, to the be&s;t of my ideas; and even when they followed up the <HI>primary</HI> idea of &s;horter duration of Parliaments, and more frequent elections, and adopted the idea of univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual Parliaments, they went cer|tainly no further than the Duke of Richmond and Mr. Pitt had gone before.</P>
</SP>

<P>You mu&s;t take care not to mention the word <HI>primary,</HI> be|cau&s;e it may inculpate me further; for that is one word that is charged again&s;t me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I con&s;ider all words in our Dictionary lawful to be u&s;ed; and it is a dreadful cri&s;is that we are come to, if a man is to be criminated for a word.</P>

<P>You &s;poke of the Engli&s;h Delegates; you don't mean that they repre&s;ented the people of England?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, only tho&s;e who &s;ent them; I under&s;tood that Mr. Margarot and Mr. Sinclair repre&s;ented about 5000 people, and Mr. Brown about 5000 from Sheffield.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have not po&s;itivey &s;worn to the entire &s;croll of Mi|nutes &s;hewn to you; &s;ome part of it you don't acknowledge.</P>

<P>Though the name of Minutes is given to them, are they, in fact, the Minutes of the Convention till they have received the revi&s;al of the Committee?</P>

<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the be&s;t of your recollection (I made a motion about the union of the two kingdoms), did it appear to you that that motion had a &s;editious tendency?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the contrary, I conceive it would be for the good of mankind, and the &s;alvation of the&s;e kingdoms.</P>

<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a notion 'tis; then, all the knowledge you gained of a Secret Committee, was the next day among the Sections, and among the Friends?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>That reminds me of a mi&s;take I made before; for I find that I have recorded that very motion which Mr. Sinclair moved to be burnt, and which was afterwards agreed not to be burnt; and I heard further of the bu&s;ine&s;s next day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a motion made for a Convention of Emergen|cy; did the Convention ever fix upon or delineate the plan by which they were to act, or did that Convention ever take place?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not that I know of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>In joining the Friends of the People, and in joining the Briti&s;h Convention, for the purpo&s;e of obtaining a reform, did you think your&s;elves warranted by the Con&s;titution to endea|vour to obtain a redre&s;s of grievances?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly; and I would think &s;o &s;till, if I were to be &s;ent to Botany Bay for it.</P>
</SP>

<P>Are tho&s;e grievances done away?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means; and I am &s;orry for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you of opinion, that if a Convention Bill was pa&s;&s;ed in the Briti&s;h Parliament, it would tend to le&s;&s;en tho&s;e grievances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would extend them tenfold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would be the con&s;equence of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the Habeas Corpus act, and of the Act for preventing wrongous impri&s;onment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be certainly a great encroachment upon the pri|vilege of Britons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Might not every peaceable inhabitant of the&s;e realms run great danger, in ca&s;e of a foreign inva&s;ion, of lo&s;ing his property, by the enemies plundering him of it, if they were &s;ucce&s;sful?&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no doubt of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think it would be more con&s;titutional in Engli&s;h|men, more con&s;titutional in Scotchmen, more con&s;titutional in Britons, to &s;it idle and look at a foreign inva&s;ion, or attend a Convention of Emergency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare &s;ay the whole Court, and all the audience will a|gree, that to meet upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, would be a work of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was foreign inva&s;ion the expre&s;&s;ion that was made u&s;e of, or was a French inva&s;ion ever mentioned?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>As far as I recollect, French inva&s;ion was mentioned in &s;ome per&s;on's motion; but I cannot &s;ay in who&s;e motion, or whether it was in doors, or out of doors; or in the Conven|tion, or out of the Convention, I cannot &s;ay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you mean to &s;ay, that an Inva&s;ion from France was uppermo&s;t in the minds of the Convention?</P>

<P>I cannot &s;ay what was uppermo&s;t; but I know I have heard that expre&s;&s;ion, but I believe it was out of the Convention.</P>

<P> Did I not complain of the treatment I had received in hav|ing been taken out of my bed at &s;even o'clock in the morning, and kept in a room where there was not even a chair to &s;it upon until five in the afternoon, as though I had been a criminal and a felon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mentioned the&s;e circum&s;tances; and I think my an|&s;wer was, that I was exceedingly &s;orry for it, but that they had not been communicated to me, or I &s;hould have taken care that you &s;hould be better accommodated.</P>

<P> All I mean to a&s;k you, my Lord, is, whether you could di&s;cern any confu&s;ion, tumult, or riot, at the meeting at Laing's work&s;hop on the 6th of December, at your entrance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was no other riot, that I know of, than what was occa&s;ioned by the magi&s;trates interfering.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P> Then it was the magi&s;trates cau&s;ed the riot?&mdash;very well, my Lord. Was you acquainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s that the Con|vention were upon that night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I know nothing farther than it was a Convention for illegal purpo&s;es.</P>

<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P> Whether, upon the preceding night, when I was ab&s;ent, when you interrupted the Convention, you was not likewi&s;e told that the bu&s;ine&s;s they were going to proceed upon was, whether it would be be&s;t to petition the King or the Parliament for a Re|form?&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Margarot.</SPEAKER>
<P> Now, my Lord, comes a very delicate matter indeed. I mean to call upon my Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk, and I hope that the que&s;tions and the an&s;wers will be given in the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn manner. I have received a piece of information which I &s;hall lay before the Court, in the cour&s;e of my que&s;tions: fir&s;t, my Lord, are you upon oath?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</SPEAKER>

<P>Did any per&s;on, did a lady &s;ay to you that the mob would not allow you to whip him? and, my Lord, did you not &s;ay that the mob would be the better for lo&s;ing a little blood? The&s;e are the que&s;tions, my Lord, that I wi&s;h to put to you at pre&s;ent, in the pre&s;ence of the Court: deny them or acknowledge them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P> Do you think I &s;hould an&s;wer que&s;tions of that &s;ort, Lord Henderland?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Henderland.</SPEAKER>
<P> No, my Lord, they do not relate to this tri|al: que&s;tions as to facts, which are at all material to the charges contained in this indictment, my Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk is obliged to an&s;wer, but not otherwi&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord E&s;kgrove.</SPEAKER>
<P> What may have been &s;aid in a private com|pany cannot in any way affect this ca&s;e as to the Pannel at the bar: it certainly cannot throw any light upon the &s;ubject: my Lord, I have concurred in allowing this gentleman, who is a &s;tranger from London, to put &s;uch que&s;tions as I never before heard of in a Court of Ju&s;tice, where, my Lord, every &s;ubject of this country, the meane&s;t and the poore&s;t that &s;tands at that bar, may have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of coun&s;el learned in the law. If his &s;ituation was &s;uch that he could not afford it, he might have got it by the authority of this Court, which would have pre|vented many things that were &s;tated upon the relevancy. My Lord, there has not been a que&s;tion put to your Lord&s;hip that could at all avail Mr. Margarot as to his innocency in this trial,
<PB N="75" REF="027594_0075_0FD7C0542CEB9E58">
and your Lord&s;hip very properly waved an&s;wering them. I am of opinion that you ought not to an&s;wer que&s;tions of that &s;ort, which cannot involve the fate of the trial; I therefore think that it is not con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of this Court, and cannot be beneficial to the Pannel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Swinton.</SPEAKER>
<P> Any thing that may tend to exculpate him, or alleviate the crime charged again&s;t him, had he propo&s;ed que&s;|tions of that &s;ort, not only my Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk, but every one of us mu&s;t have an&s;wered them by the laws of the country; but the an&s;wer to none of the&s;e que&s;tions can either tend to ex|culpate him or alleviate the offence of which he is accu&s;ed. My Lord, not one of them are proper, not one of them are compe|tent, and ought not to be allowed to be put; and were he not a &s;tranger to this country, I &s;hould look upon it as an in&s;ult offered to this Court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Dun&s;innan.</SPEAKER>
<P> The Pannel is allowed to adduce what ex|culpatory witne&s;&s;es he thinks proper; your Lord&s;hip well knows that by the con&s;tant rule of this Court, before the Pannel pro|ceeds with his exculpatory proof, he is called upon to &s;tate the nature of that proof: he has put que&s;tions to your Lord&s;hip, and it appears to me that no an&s;wer to tho&s;e que&s;tions could in any degree tend to exculpate or alleviate the charges again&s;t him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P> Have you any other witne&s;&s;es?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is needle&s;s, my Lord, when I am told that the an&s;wers to &s;uch que&s;tions would neither exculpate me nor alleviate the charges again&s;t me, but it would have gone to &s;hew the Jury that I was pre-judged before my trial came on; and I did mean indeed to have followed it up by another que&s;tion, had you been on your oath; but as you are not, I will not put it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P> Have you any other witne&s;&s;es to adduce?</P>

<P>Yes, my Lord.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Charles Steward,</HI> called.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Advocate.</SPEAKER>
<P> For what purpo&s;e do you call him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Margarot.</SPEAKER>
<P> To a&s;k him a que&s;tion concerning &s;omething that appeared in one of the&s;e papers, The Edinburgh Herald.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Abercrombie.</SPEAKER>
<P> That is not a paper libell'd upon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Margarot.</SPEAKER>
<P> No, but it libels me and the friends of a Re|form in Parliament; it is a compari&s;on between the Friends of a Reform in this country, and the Anarchi&s;ts in France, and I want, but I don't &s;ee why I need tell my wants, unle&s;s he is to be called; I want to know from whom it was that he received the original of this letter; that is a fair que&s;tion that I have a right to a&s;k in any court of Ju&s;tice, and it is a que&s;tion that ought to be an&s;wered: 'tis a paper that has thrown an odium upon the Friends of Reform.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Dun&s;innan.</SPEAKER>
<P> This would lead into a very exten&s;ive field, if the Pannel be allowed to go into an inve&s;tigation of all the
<PB N="76" REF="027594_0076_0FD7BFA877F702D8">
writings that have been publi&s;hed, that have thrown, as he &s;ays, an odium upon the Friends of Reform, and there is no|thing founded upon it again&s;t the Pannel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Henderland.</SPEAKER>
<P> This paper is no part of the evidence pro|duced again&s;t Mr. Margarot, otherwi&s;e he might be entitled to enquire by whom it was put in; but to go into a que&s;tion of eve|ry thing that has been &s;aid for and again&s;t the Friends of the People in the new&s;papers, is totally irrelevant to this trial; for if Mr. Margarot has been injured in that re&s;pect, the law is open to him, not on this trial, but on another occa&s;ion, and it can have nothing to do with this trial.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Swinton.</SPEAKER>
<P> By an act of 1748, it is the pri&s;oner's duty by that Act of Parliament, to give in, the night before the trial, or &s;ometime before the trial, the facts upon which he is to found his defence, and he &s;hall be allowed to prove nothing in his de|fence, but what is contained in that li&s;t of facts; but if what he has now &s;tated would be material to his defence, I am &s;ure the Lord Advocate would allow him to prove it; but there is nothing here that could tend either to exculpate or alleviate; it would lead us into every thing that has been wrote, pro and con. upon the &s;ubject, and who it was that gave the foundation for it, and therefore I conceive it not regular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord E&s;kgrove.</SPEAKER>
<P> I am of the &s;ame opinion; I think it can be of no avail to him upon the face of the earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P> It is very true, my Lord, that there is a &s;tatute of the late King, and I think it was a very proper rule that was adopted by that &s;tatute, and I am &s;orry that it is no more attended to than it is, and I &s;hould be &s;orry to deny this Pannel any thing that could avail him in his defence, and he might have had the advice of Scots lawyers or agents, and there|fore I am of opinion, that it would not tend to criminate other people who are not here, or are not put upon their de|fence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Margarot.</SPEAKER>
<P> Then it is needle&s;s &s;aying any further upon that; it would only have tended to clear up the minds of the Jury, who might have received unfavourable impre&s;&s;ions, and which might have been done away by &s;ome que&s;tions put to the printer; but which; perhaps, &s;ome people would wi&s;h to &s;ee en|couraged.</P>

<P>When force was &s;aid to be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;per&s;e us, after the token of force given by the Sheriff to the Chairman, was any further force nece&s;&s;ary?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; after Mr. Margarot came out of the chair, &s;omebody called Mr. Gerald to it, and he took the chair, and we did not di&s;per&s;e till he went to prayer, and then we went away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it actual force that di&s;per&s;ed us, or an ideal force, a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to orders that we did not re&s;i&s;t?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>

<P>With what view did you join that Convention?</P>

<P>I joined it with a view to obtain a Reform in the repre|&s;entation of the people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was you convinced in your own mind that the attempt to obtain a Reform was legal and con&s;titutional?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are on your oath, and I de&s;ire you to an&s;wer this fairly; if you had found that the Members of the Briti&s;h Con|vention had departed from that con&s;titutional line in which they &s;at out, and in which they were acting when you joined them, would you have abandoned them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I had thought that they had deviated from that con&s;ti|tutional line, I certainly would have abandoned them, no doubt of it; but I have not found it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have not then abandoned them yet?</P>

<P>What was the motive of the Convention, for endeavour|ing to promote a union between Scotland and England?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tood it was to promote a union between tho&s;e &s;o|cieties that wi&s;hed for Reform, that they might unite in adopt|ing the Con&s;titutional means to obtain it.</P>

<P>What did you under&s;tand to be the &s;ubject of the debate that night?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a motion about another petition to Parliament.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was &s;aid to the Sheriff when he attempted to di&s;|per&s;e us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe he was told that it was a peaceable con&s;titutional meeting, and that his di&s;per&s;ing us was illegal; we were met for the purpo&s;e of petitioning Parliament, and were entitled to do &s;o by the con&s;titution.</P>

<P>What was his reply?</P>

<P>He touched you by the hand, and &s;aid, come out, and you &s;aid, no, it mu&s;t be a little more than that, and then he took you by the arm and gently pulled you out, as I would a friend, and then you came out; then Mr. Gerald took the

<P> Gentlemen of the Jury, you are called upon in the common and u&s;ual routine of your duty to decide upon the truth of the indictment, which I have felt it my duty to pre|fer again&s;t the Pannel at the bar, who is &s;tiled, and calls him&s;elf in the paper which is termed a Declaration, emitted by him&s;elf, before a proper officer, to be a merchant, re&s;iding in Marybon in London; you are therefore his equals, and his proper and com|petent Jury to decide upon his guilt.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I mu&s;t &s;ay, and again repeat, that you &s;it this night in the common cour&s;e and routine of your duty, although, if I charge my memory right, or I can tru&s;t to the Note which I took at the time the Pannel in that &s;peech, or rather &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;peeches which came from him, not in my opinion with much judgment, not in my apprehen&s;ion with much prudence; &s;aid &s;omething of Packed Juries, and (which he has a right to &s;ay) of my endeavouring to impo&s;e upon your under&s;tandings: I tru&s;t you will feel this moment, as I hope and tru&s;t the country at large will feel, that it is not in the power of the highe&s;t &s;ub|ject of this country, be his &s;ituation what it may, to pack a Jury either here or in our &s;i&s;ter-kingdom, or to prevent the meane&s;t criminal from getting what the law and the con&s;titution of his country gives him; a ju&s;t, a fair, and an impartial trial. I tru&s;t you will feel at this moment, what I do in my &s;ituation as Pro|&s;ecutor, a complete and perfect independence; a de&s;ire to do my duty to my country at large; a determination to follow the dictates of my own con&s;cience, and when I exerci&s;e that to the be&s;t of my judgment and the be&s;t of my under&s;tanding, as I know and I tru&s;t you will do this evening, I care not what is &s;aid either by a criminal in the moment of intemperance, or by per&s;ons without doors, endeavouring to &s;hake the confidence which the people of the country have of the ine&s;timable privilege of trial by Jury, I deny that Juries are packed, or that any in&s;tance has exi&s;ted, or can po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t in this country, of &s;o foul and &s;o gro&s;s an a&s;per&s;ion being ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am not without &s;ome apprehen&s;ions, in con&s;e|quence of an indi&s;po&s;ition which I have laboured under &s;ince I la&s;t addre&s;&s;ed a Jury of this country upon a trial of a &s;imilar na|ture. I am not yet perfectly without my apprehen&s;ions, that I may not be able at this late hour of the night, and in a Court &s;o crouded as this, to do what is on all occa&s;ions my bounden duty, and which the peculiar &s;ituation of this country, at pre&s;ent, more particularly demands, to &s;tate the nature of the evidence lying upon the table, joined to that which was read at the foot of it to day; that I may not be able to bring it in &s;o con&s;picuous a point of view, or di&s;criminate with that accuracy in the volume of Factious, Seditious, and Trea&s;onable matter, which lies upon
<PB N="83" REF="027594_0083_0FD54DAF623F45E0">
your table, that which you ought to dwell upon, and that which you ought not; but I tru&s;t in &s;ome degree to the goodne&s;s of my cau&s;e; I tru&s;t more to the under&s;tanding of the Jury, and I tru&s;t &s;omething to that feeling of regard to my Country, and that &s;pi|rit which a good and loyal &s;ubject ought to feel and to entertain, that I &s;hall yet be able to make out &s;uch a ca&s;e from the evidence before you, which will impo&s;e upon you the &s;evere, but the ju&s;t, ta&s;k of returning a verdict of guilty, again&s;t the per&s;on at your bar, upon the mo&s;t &s;olid, convincing, and conclu&s;ive proof that it is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the Pannel at your bar &s;tands charged with Se|dition. Upon that &s;ubject we have to-day had much di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; we have had a great deal of ignorance profe&s;&s;ed, by men who &s;urely ought to have been the la&s;t to make that profe&s;&s;ion, who hold them&s;elves out to their fellow &s;ubjects as Members of a Convention which is to teach reform to Parliament, which is to &s;ub&s;titute &s;omething better, in place of what we enjoy, who have audaciou&s;ly pretended to a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves that impor|tant ta&s;k, and that important character, of &s;etting a&s;ide or of im|proving that inheritance which they enjoy from tho&s;e who have gone before them, and, who I &s;incerely hope and wi&s;h attended with that propriety, and that degree of attention which was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the importance of that ta&s;k before they entered upon it, or before they pretended to be ignorant of what Sedition was.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, to refer to Law Books is perfectly unnece&s;&s;ary; the Coun&s;el who opened this Ca&s;e to-day upon the part of the pro&s;ecution, traced his authority back to the earlie&s;t book which we know, or which the Law of Scotland acknowledges, the book of <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem;</HI> and if the Pannel at the Bar, or tho&s;e Members of the Briti&s;h Convention who have profe&s;&s;ed to-day &s;uch ignorance of what Sedition is, if they had turned up, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, the only criminal book of the Law which we Law|yers acknowledge to be of authority, I mean, the book of Sir George Mackenzie, they would have found a &s;eparate and di&s;|tinct treati&s;e, defining expre&s;sly the crime of Sedition, giving it its technical definition as clearly as the definition of murder, fal&s;ehood, forgery, rape, or any other crime which occurs in the common cour&s;e of criminal juri&s;prudence. If any &s;et of men let their o&s;ten&s;ive purpo&s;e be a redre&s;s of grievances, as in this ca&s;e, till it a&s;&s;umed the appellation of the Briti&s;h Convention of the Delegates of the People, a&s;&s;ociated to obtain univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual Parliaments, as was the ca&s;e I &s;ay, of the former Convention, of which the boy Calder told us ju&s;t now he had been a Member, if their purpo&s;e was reform; yet, if that pur|po&s;e is not to addre&s;s the King or the Legi&s;lature of the Coun|try, in a con&s;titutional way, by petition to the King; but if on the contrary, they are aping and imitating the example of a neighbouring Country with which we are at war, or if it goes
<PB N="84" REF="027594_0084_0FD7BFC970C031B0">
the length of convocating thou&s;ands of per&s;ons who may form the&s;e Societies, not to apply to King, Lords, and Commons, in a proper, legal, and con&s;titutional way for redre&s;s; but if it does a&s;&s;ume the power of forming it&s;elf into a &s;eparate body, or Con|vention altogether; if it goes the length of what I will &s;hew you, upon a fair review of the evidence, it did in this ca&s;e, over|awing Parliament in the execution of its duty; that in the event of an inva&s;ion, or &s;ome &s;uch &s;imilar circum&s;tance, they were not only to control and overawe the proceedings of Parliament, but were, in the con&s;truction of common &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, to join, in place of re&s;i&s;ting the Invaders, for that is the conclu&s;ion which I &s;hall draw from the evidence on the table, in &s;pite of all the declarations and profe&s;&s;ions which came from the A&s;&s;ociates of the Pannel this day at the bar: if it goes that length, it is clearly and di&s;tinctly the crime of Sedition, as clear and unequi|vocal as ever occured in the practice of any civilized country. The evidence, therefore, Gentlemen, is now before you&mdash;I &s;tate that to be my view of the ca&s;e; that is the opinion which I form upon the review of it; my opinion is not binding upon you; but you will con&s;ider tho&s;e parts of it, which it is now my duty to &s;tate and comment upon: you will give to it your be&s;t atten|tion, and lay your hands upon your hearts, and con&s;ider, whe|ther it is not the only, the plain, and the nece&s;&s;ary deduction and inference, which ari&s;es not from any particular expre&s;&s;ion, cir|cum&s;tance, motion, or paper; but from a general complex view of the whole, tallying and comparing it at the &s;ame time with the parole te&s;timony laid before you this day.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the evidence is of two kinds, written and parole: the principal and chief part of it (and I &s;ay &s;o, becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t certain and the mo&s;t unerring), is the written evidence ari&s;ing from the minutes of this &s;elf-con&s;tituted Convention; from the papers found upon Mr. Margarot, contained and refer|red to in the general inventory upon the table, and from three numbers of the Gazetteer, which in the &s;equel I &s;hall &s;hew you to be completely brought home to this Convention.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the fir&s;t que&s;tion which you are to con&s;ider is, whether or not this meeting, from the 19th of November (for I go no farther back) till the 4th of December la&s;t, where the Mi|nutes &s;top, becau&s;e we all know, and it is proved to-day, that the Magi&s;tracy of this City, did, early on the morning of the 5th, apprehend the&s;e per&s;ons and &s;eize their papers. The fir&s;t que&s;|tion which you are to a&s;k is this: Was it or not a meeting of a &s;editious nature? for if you are of opinion, that it was not a meeting of a &s;editious nature; if you &s;hould con&s;ider it in a dif|ferent point of view, to what I humbly pre&s;ume to do; that it was an innocent, fair, legal, and con&s;titutional mea&s;ure, it is in vain, &s;uperfluous, and unnece&s;&s;ary for you to enquire, whether the Pannel is a Principal Actor in that Meeting; becau&s;e no man can be found guilty of the proceedings of a Meeting which a jury
<PB N="85" REF="027594_0085_0FD7BFB926BA2F40">
&s;hall be of opinion, is within the pale of the law, and &s;uch as the laws of this Country entitle any man to call together.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, &s;omething was &s;aid to day, in the cour&s;e of this debate (if I may &s;o term it), that was per&s;onal again&s;t my&s;elf as a Member of another Convention; &s;omething was &s;aid with re|gard to the a&s;toni&s;hing circum&s;tance, of not bringing the Bo|rough reformers to trial in this court, &s;omething was &s;aid al&s;o with apparent marks of exultation on the part of the pannel, that though three Conventions of the Friends of the People had taken place in this city, in the cour&s;e of eighteen months pa&s;t, no notice whatever was taken by the Public Pro&s;ecutor of any of tho&s;e Conventions, till, as Margarot, I think, &s;tated, we took alarm; becau&s;e we &s;aw, that he and his friends were in danger of opening the eyes of the people; that it was not till we were alarmed, and the eyes of the people were about to be opened, to the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e abu&s;es, which it was their object to cor|rect; that I (negligent in my duty before) brought this man and others his a&s;&s;ociates to an&s;wer for the offence.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, my an&s;wer is this: I de&s;ire not to enter into the que&s;tion, how far Conventions by Delegation are, or not legal. &mdash;It is not the que&s;tion now under your con&s;ideration; had the&s;e Gentlemen confined them&s;elves to what was the Law of their Country, or adhered to what they profe&s;&s;ed to be the ca&s;e, I &s;hould not have felt it my duty to have brought them to trial, for being a&s;&s;embled in a Convention, or any thing of that kind, which had for its object either the correction of the County Laws, of the Borough Laws, or any other correction which the wilde&s;t or mo&s;t unrea&s;onable &s;peculati&s;t might think it worth his while to aim at.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I never thought of bringing before you the Con|vention of 1791, the Convention of April 1793, or the &s;ub&s;equent Convention in October la&s;t; nor did I think of bringing the per&s;ons now charged before you with Sedition, till the very name they a&s;&s;umed, every adverti&s;ement they in&s;erted in the papers, every thing verbal or written, demon&s;trated to my mind, demon&s;trated to Scotland, demon&s;trated to England, and to the empire at large, that they were a &s;et of French Convention|i&s;ts.&mdash;I give them that name; per&s;ons who, as far as they dur&s;t, and their audacity I believe was matter of a&s;toni&s;hment to the country at large, who dur&s;t take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this metropolis, who dared within its walls to hold out the example of a French model, holding out their example as the principle upon which they acted, as the objects and point to which their deliberations tended.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, &s;omething was &s;aid of orders being given to Mr. David&s;on, the Sheriff Sub&s;titute, that he acted by orders: whe|ther he acted by order or not, whether he acted by the orders of the re&s;pectable Gentleman who was Sheriff Depute of the County, but who has &s;ince received a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of his
<PB N="86" REF="027594_0086_0FD54DB3E90C50E8">
Sovereign's favour, whether he went by my orders, or by the orders of any body el&s;e, is nothing to the purpo&s;e; I did con&s;ult with that Gentleman; I did con&s;ult with your chief magi&s;trate; I de&s;ired them to attend to their duty; if any de&s;ire of mine was nece&s;&s;ary; we acted in concert together; had we done le&s;s, we had been guilty of a breach of office; we had been guilty of ne|glecting the mo&s;t important intere&s;ts of mankind.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, were I to run over every &s;ingle paper contained in that Inventory, were I to addre&s;s you upon every motion which appears in that &s;croll of Minutes before you, I &s;hould de|tain you this evening to a very late hour indeed; but I &s;hall &s;e|lect a few of the mo&s;t pointed and di&s;tinct motions, and evidence therein contained.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is an important duty in which you are now en|gaged; the Pannel either is, or profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to be, an Eng|li&s;hman; he is in &s;ome re&s;pects a foreigner to this Country; but you will not con&s;ider when you are to decide either upon the life, the reputation or the guilt, or innocence of a fellow creature, whether he is of Scotland, or whether he is of England.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I will &s;ay hardly a word in &s;upport of the written evidence which is now upon your table&mdash;it appears that the papers libelled upon, which I have ju&s;t de&s;cribed to you, are traced home in the mo&s;t complete and &s;atisfactory manner po&s;&s;i|ble&mdash;there is not a tittle of written evidence&mdash;there is not a do|cument now before you which is not proved beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;pute&mdash;I refer in general to the te&s;timonies of Mr. Da|vid&s;on; of Mr. Scott, the Fi&s;cal; Lyon, and I think Mack.&mdash; The&s;e four, I believe, di&s;tinctly trace them from the room in which Margarot and Gerald &s;lept into the &s;heriff clerk's office, and having traced them there they are brought into court, and it is impo&s;&s;ible to enquire further. Indeed &s;ome que&s;tion was put by the Pannel at the bar (who di&s;played I mu&s;t admit a con&s;i|derable degree of ingenuity and acutene&s;s in his own defence), as if it might have happened from the manner the&s;e papers were found, that others might have been carried in even by Lyon, the me&s;&s;enger&mdash;that other papers might have been carried in, as they were re&s;iding at a public inn in this city, by other per|&s;ons, and that they were not nece&s;&s;arily the papers of Gerald, and of Margarot&mdash;In every ca&s;e where written evidence is li|belled upon, in &s;upport of any crime, I a&s;k your&s;elves if it is po&s;&s;ible to give better evidence of the identity of papers than was done in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e&mdash;or if you &s;uppo&s;e, contrary to evidence and contrary to fact, that Lyon, the me&s;&s;enger, was entru&s;ted by Mr. David&s;on. or Mr. Pringle, or me, or the Lord Provo&s;t, with papers of a &s;editious nature, which he carried into that room where they were &s;leeping, in order to ground a fal&s;e accu&s;ation again&s;t them&mdash;if you can &s;uppo&s;e that po&s;&s;ible then to be &s;ure any thing that I have &s;aid, or have hereafter to &s;ay in &s;upport of the charge again&s;t this man, certainly will not
<PB N="87" REF="027594_0087_0FD54DB628FE7220">
be worth attending to&mdash;Gentlemen, on the contrary, the&s;e pa|pers were found in the room where they &s;lept, were put into a trunk, which trunk was returned back to Margarot and Gerald, and you have it in evidence, that when it was examined in their pre&s;ence, Gerald &s;elected his&mdash;Margarot claimed the re&s;t, or at lea&s;t allowed them to be inventoried without denying them, and tho&s;e which did not relate to this bu&s;ine&s;s, were returned to them both.</P>
<P>Gentlemen.&mdash;I tru&s;t that quibbling defence, for it does not de&s;erve any other name, will &s;atisfy your minds, that the gen|tleman does know that the import of the&s;e papers bears hard again&s;t him, and that he wi&s;hes to &s;helter him&s;elf from the infe|rence which your minds will drew, by &s;tating a po&s;&s;ibility, which cannot exi&s;t, that they might have been carried there by other people, in order to ground an accu&s;ation again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, holding that to be clear, I &s;hall beg your atten|tion in the fir&s;t place, to the minutes of the convention, for it is the ground work, and the ba&s;is of the charge again&s;t him; it was a paper which I was very anxious if po&s;&s;ible to obtain, becau&s;e I know that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have a&s;ked a Jury to have given a verdict again&s;t any man upon &s;u&s;picious, however &s;trong tho&s;e &s;u&s;picious might have been, and you will be &s;atisfied from what we &s;aw this day, from the manner in which we &s;aw the witne&s;&s;es give their te&s;timony, Citizen Ro&s;s particularly, who has &s;poke out; and I am &s;ure it gives me plea|&s;ure to applaud the conduct of a witne&s;s. I have great &s;atis|faction and high plea&s;ure in giving this tribute of prai&s;e to Ci|tizen Ro&s;s, and the &s;ame with re&s;pect to Coborn, who, I think, from the whole of his te&s;timony, though a friend and a&s;&s;ociate of the Pannel at the bar, has given a fair, a true, and a deci|&s;ive evidence.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the fir&s;t thing I &s;hall beg your attention to are the &s;teps previous to and accompanying that which is &s;tated in pages fifth and &s;ixth of the indictment. In page fifth you will ob&s;erve &s;tated a motion re&s;pecting a Convention of Emergency, and the ca&s;es in which they were to meet are proved in the fir&s;t place by the negative evidence of their minutes, and confirmed by the te&s;timonies of Coborn and of George Ro&s;s.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, that motion appears to have been fir&s;t made by a gentleman of the name of Callendar, to whom this day was ex|clu&s;ively appropriated for meeting the ju&s;tice of his country, but who it &s;eems has not cho&s;en to &s;tand trial, and the fir&s;t no|tice given of this motion, I will read from the minutes&mdash;6th day's &s;itting, 25th November 1793. Citizen Callendar moved, that in ca&s;e the Mini&s;ter bring into the Commons Hou&s;e a motion for a convention bill, it &s;hould be noticed immediately to the de|legates. This is the fir&s;t appearance of this motion in the mi|nutes, and as it was told us by &s;everal of the witne&s;&s;es to day, the forms of this hou&s;e, as it is called, or of this Convention,
<PB N="88" REF="027594_0088_0FD54DB7A7F58DA0">
did not admit of a motion made one day being deliberated upon till the next&mdash;the motion lies over accordingly till the en&s;uing day, when you will find the meeting again re&s;umed, and Callen|dar's motion being then taken under con&s;ideration, amendments were propo&s;ed by &s;everal per&s;ons, and it was moved by Mr. Mar|garot, that a committee con&s;i&s;ting of the mover, &s;econder, and tho&s;e that had moved for amendments, be appointed to draw up a motion that may meet the idea of all, among whom was Mr. Calder, the young gentleman who&s;e actual attendance upon the Univer&s;ity may perhaps better qualify him to di&s;cu&s;s que&s;tions as to the reform (or as I call it the alteration) of the con&s;titution, than the learned Mr. John Clark, or Mr. Wardlaw, or Mr. Ait|che&s;on, or any of tho&s;e gentlemen who have &s;o well weighed and con&s;idered the ancient in&s;titutions of the laws and con&s;titu|tion of their country, before they a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves the im|portant office which they have taken upon them. Citizen John Gartley moves, that the &s;en&s;e of the hou&s;e be taken upon the &s;pirit of the motion, upon the words of the motion, and after|wards upon Mr. Margarot's motion. Upon the fir&s;t motion it was carried unanimou&s;ly to adopt the motion as to its &s;pirit; &s;e|condly, by a great majority not to adopt the words of it; and, thirdly, that the amendments be referred to a committee as above&mdash;And at a &s;ub&s;equent diet, I mean a &s;ub&s;equent &s;itting of the Convention, the minutes tells us, that Citizen Sinclair read the amendments upon Citizen Callendar's motion, as agreed upon by the committee, and it was agreed, upon the motion of Citizen Blank, that the hou&s;e &s;hould re&s;olve it&s;elf into a commit|tee for its mature con&s;ideration. In the cour&s;e of the conver&s;a|tion, Citizen Brown gave a hi&s;tory of the habeas corpus act. After an excellent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the que&s;tion, pertinent remarks and amendments, the convention was re&s;umed, and the whole as amended, being read over, the members &s;tood upon their feet, and &s;olemnly and unanimou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;olution as follows&mdash; Then follows a blank in the paper, and immediately afterwards the minutes proceed, at the di&s;tance of a page, and &s;omewhat more, that Citizen Gerald in a very energetic, and animated ad|dre&s;s, expre&s;&s;ed his happine&s;s at the motion pa&s;&s;ed, and Citizen Brown, followed him in a manly &s;peech, and proved the influ|ence of the executive government over the Parliament. Citi|zen Margarot then read and propo&s;ed the following motion: That a &s;ecret committee of three, and the &s;ecretary, (it is proved afterwards that Clark, Margarot, Skirving, and Brown, were the four who actually compo&s;ed this committee) be appointed to determine the place where &s;uch Convention of Emergency &s;hould meet, that &s;uch place &s;hould remain a &s;ecret with them, and with the &s;ecretary of the Convention, and that each delegate &s;hall, at the breaking up of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, be entru&s;ted with a &s;ealed letter, containing the name of the place of meeting; this letter &s;hall be delivered unopened to his con&s;tituents, the receipt of
<PB N="89" REF="027594_0089_0FD7BFCAED1083A8">
which &s;hall be acknowledged by a letter to the &s;ecretary, pre|&s;erved in the &s;ame &s;tate, until the period &s;hall arrive at which it &s;hall be deemed nece&s;&s;ary for the delegate to &s;et off.&mdash;This mo|tion was &s;econded by Citizen Moffatt, and carried unanimou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you have in the fir&s;t place this proved completely by the minutes, that Citizen Callendar in his fir&s;t motion, which was adopted as to its &s;pirit, but rejected as to its words, had nei|ther more nor le&s;s than this object in view, that as &s;oon as par|liament &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary or proper, if they ever thought it nece&s;&s;ary or proper, to bring in a &s;imilar bill, to that which pa&s;&s;ed in Ireland, that this &s;hould be the &s;ignal, or notification for calling the Convention of Emergency together, and that of it&s;elf without going to other ca&s;es of Emergency, was ju&s;t this, that they were to act as a control upon parliament, and to en|deavour to overawe (you will con&s;ider whether in a legal or in an illegal way) the free exerci&s;e of the right of the legi&s;lature&mdash; Can you &s;uppo&s;e that if their purpo&s;e was legal, if they had not wi&s;hed to overawe, and intimidate the parliament from doing their duty, would you have found them alarmed or afraid of their conduct? Had their purpo&s;e been only to petition par|liament, and to &s;tate their remon&s;trances again&s;t &s;uch a motion (a right, which every freeman of this country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es) what ex|planation is to be given of that &s;ecrecy in which this mea&s;ure is wrapped up, if their purpo&s;e was hone&s;t, but is it &s;o? you find in this paper an account of a re&s;olution which they came to, in a mo&s;t &s;olemn and mo&s;t unanimous manner, but which re&s;olu|tion does not appear in the face of the minutes&mdash;if it was a re|&s;olution merely of the quiet and loyal nature ju&s;t now &s;tated, do you &s;uppo&s;e that motion would have been left out, or do you believe what Aitche&s;on tells you, and in which he is confirmed by the minutes in Ro&s;s's hand writing, for Ro&s;s's hand writing ends immediately before the blank, and Aitche&s;on's comes im|mediately after the blank&mdash;is it not clearly proved that what they were about was a thing which they dur&s;t not put into this paper, which they po&s;tponed to &s;ome other occa&s;ion, which Sin|clair, as Aitche&s;on tells you, propo&s;ed &s;hould be burnt, but which he re&s;i&s;ted &s;ucce&s;sfully, and prevented it from being burned? burning an innocent paper is not the characteri&s;tic of men of virtue&mdash;of men of character&mdash;of men con&s;cious they were only doing what was legal, and what was ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, let us then &s;ee what the parole te&s;timony makes out, and whether it does not preci&s;ely confirm the conclu&s;ion, and inferences. I am now drawing not only from what is proved by the minutes, but al&s;o from what is not proved by the minutes, I mean the in&s;ertion of this extraordinary blank, to which there is nothing &s;imilar, except a blank of four lines, in all the 94 pages of minutes upon your table.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, Coburn, I think, tells you, that be&s;ides this con|vention bill, there were a variety of other ca&s;es in which this
<PB N="90" REF="027594_0090_0FD54DBAB71201D8">
Convention of Emergency were to meet: He told us that they all agreed that the introduction of a convention bill was to be one great object when the people &s;hould meet, and I wi&s;h you would look at your notes when the people &s;hould meet <HI>to a&s;&s;ert their rights</HI>&mdash;I am not to de&s;cend to critici&s;ms upon a word, but I may at lea&s;t beg to know whether, if it was merely drawing up a re&s;pectful petition to the King or to the parliament, it was nece&s;&s;ary to put &s;o &s;trong a declaration as this to which Coburn &s;wears, or was it not better to &s;peak out the truth, that they meant, in &s;uch an event, to remon&s;trate again&s;t the mea&s;ure, or petition Parliament again&s;t its pa&s;&s;ing into a law? but you have, on the contrary, an expre&s;&s;ion which favours more of re&s;i&s;tance than any thing el&s;e&mdash;that they were to meet in this unknown place, which was to be concealed even from the delegates them|&s;elves, and of cour&s;e from they eye of the executive power&mdash; that in that event they were to meet and a&s;&s;ert their rights, but as to the manner in which they were to be a&s;&s;erted, whether in a peaceable or tumultuous way, whether the mild influence of rea&s;on was to be exerci&s;ed upon the Briti&s;h Parliament, or whe|ther by drawing out numbers of deluded men to do it by force, is your bu&s;ine&s;s now to decide, and your province alone to de|termine.</P>
<P>Gentlemen&mdash;The que&s;tion was this day put to me, was I an inqui&s;itor of the private feelings of men's minds? Had I a right to dive into the &s;ecrets of the human brea&s;t, or to di&s;cover what it was their intention to conceal?&mdash;That is the province of the Jury&mdash;it is their bu&s;ine&s;s, however careful men involved in &s;editious practices may be to gild them over with general ex|pre&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as a&s;&s;embling to a&s;&s;ert their rights; it is the pro|vince of the Jury, when they find per&s;ons engaged in the&s;e practices, not to take their profe&s;&s;ions, not to take what they declare to be the o&s;ten&s;ible purpo&s;e in view, but looking to their actions, looking to their words, looking to their proceed|ings, whether they are &s;ecret, or whether they are public, to form your impartial determination on which &s;ide the &s;cale of evidence preponderates, whether it is on the &s;ide of innocence, or whether it does not tally with guilt alone; whether it does not artfully and in&s;idiou&s;ly leave it open either to one con&s;truc|tion or the other; for if they had &s;aid that they would have a&s;|&s;erted their rights by open force, if they had dur&s;t to have &s;aid the Briti&s;h Parliament &s;hall defend the Habeas Corpus Act, or we will defend it by force of arms, if in ca&s;e of a French inva&s;ion, their purpo&s;e was not to re&s;i&s;t but to co-operate with &s;uch an in|va&s;ion, and had they expre&s;&s;ed that upon their minutes, I would not have brought Mr. Margarot to trial, I &s;hould have held him a lunatic in every &s;en&s;e of the word.&mdash;If I had brought him to trial before you, I am po&s;itive you would have thought I had brought a madman to your bar; you might have pronounced a verdict of lunacy again&s;t him, but certainly would not have
<PB N="91" REF="027594_0091_0FD54DBC21D37068">
thought him a proper object of puni&s;hment. But, Gentlemen, we have in this country a powerful Executive Government;&mdash;we have laws which control that power, and we have a Jury which can check it in its progre&s;s in a moment; but we are to expect, while that Executive Government exi&s;ts (which I tru&s;t will exi&s;t to all eternity to check every attempt of this kind) that &s;editious words will be ambiguous and doubtful upon the face of them; and when you find that Mr. Margarot, the Pannel, is a man of con&s;iderable ability, that he is a man aware of what he is about, that he is the ringleader of the&s;e per&s;ons,&mdash;of that poor unfor|tunate &s;et of creatures who came this day to your bar&mdash;of boys &mdash;of per&s;ons intoxicated, as you have &s;een&mdash;that he profe&s;&s;es him|&s;elf to be a merchant; that the trade in which he is engaged permits him, from motives of pure di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, public &s;pi|ritedne&s;s, and wi&s;hing to extend ble&s;&s;ings to Scotland, which he thinks we do not po&s;&s;e&s;s, for &s;ix weeks to dedicate his whole time and abilities to tho&s;e objects which he has held forth to you as not only fair but ju&s;tifiable; that he is the former of the&s;e mi|nutes, the maker of the&s;e motions, the ringleader of the&s;e de|luded people, who are ignorant of the commone&s;t principles of the con&s;titution, and who know at this moment as little of it as if they had never been members of a Briti&s;h Convention&mdash;I &s;ay when you recollect this, you will not expect any thing el&s;e but &s;uch an artful, in&s;idious, and ambiguous mode of expre&s;&s;ion, as may admit with perfect &s;afety either the one or the other con|&s;truction, but which I &s;hall &s;hew you in the &s;equel can be con&s;trued alone into guilt, and e&s;tabli&s;hes only this, that Mr. Margarot knew what he was about, that they eye of the Executive Go|vernment of this country was over him, he profe&s;&s;ed, and he in|&s;idiou&s;ly and artfully, along with Mr. Sinclair, in this abomina|ble committee to which the matter was referred, did give it that general ambiguous expre&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e he dur&s;t not do other|wi&s;e, and becau&s;e, which is clear from the evidence of the mi|nutes, and from the evidence of Coburn, it was &s;uch a paper as they dur&s;t not blot their minutes with; it was &s;uch a paper as they dur&s;t not hold their face to; it was &s;uch a paper as was to give ri&s;e to a committee of &s;ecrecy, where, if the thing was right, &s;ecrecy was incon&s;i&s;tent; but where, if it was wrong, it was prudent, it was nece&s;&s;ary, it was proper.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the next thing I &s;hall ob&s;erve upon is tho&s;e num|bers of the Gazetteer which are now upon the table. Citizens of Edinburgh, I u&s;e the word Citizen, I hope and I know in a fair and in a legal &s;en&s;e, you cannot be ignorant of the Edin|burgh Gazetteer. Sure I am I have the honour to be mo&s;t inti|mately acquainted with it, and it has done me the honor to be mo&s;t intimately acquainted with me.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, let us look to that paper, and though &s;ome &s;lur may perhaps for a moment ari&s;e either in your minds, or in the minds of tho&s;e who hear me, as to the authenticity of a new&s;|paper
<PB N="92" REF="027594_0092_0FD54DBDA92084C8">
as matter of evidence, I will &s;hew you, from the evidence of the minutes upon the table, that it is, what it was meant to be, an authentic account, and that as far as it goes it &s;tates no|thing but what really and truly was the &s;ub&s;tance of what pa&s;&s;ed in the Convention. I &s;hould not &s;uppo&s;e that the Jury would think me ab&s;urd enough to call them to idle paragraphs in a new&s;paper, if it had not &s;ome degree of authenticity. I refer you to the evidence of the Ro&s;&s;es, who tell you that the minutes were taken down in &s;hort-hand for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, as to that of which Mr. Margarot complains, be|ing apprehended &s;o early in the morning, I &s;hould have no ob|jection to take upon my&s;elf the blame; it was done for the pur|po&s;e of getting at Mr. Skirving and him, and all of them, at a moment when they were not looking for us, otherwi&s;e they might de&s;troy that evidence which I knew exi&s;ted of their pro|ceedings, and from that providential circum&s;tance, the&s;e mi|nutes were &s;eized in Mr. Skirving's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which were a compleat evidence again&s;t him. I am entitled to &s;ay &s;o, becau&s;e the Jury have &s;aid &s;o, which is a material circum&s;tance again&s;t the Pannel, or again&s;t any per&s;on who either is or &s;hall be tried for his acce&s;&s;ion to the proceedings of tho&s;e meetings. It was proved that after waiting &s;ome time for the four deputies, the repre&s;entatives, as I thought at fir&s;t, of all England, but I find they are only the repre&s;entatives of many thou&s;ands in London, many thou&s;ands in Norwich, and many thou&s;ands in Sheffield and different parts of the country, and the&s;e four gentlemen, the Engli&s;h delegates, came down here, it was thought &s;o im|portant an occa&s;ion, that the Convention, which had been ad|journed for &s;ome days, again re&s;umed it&s;elf; and, gentlemen, they told us that they &s;upported the Gazetteer, not as a Con|vention, not in their corporate capacity, which I was &s;urprized to hear &s;tated, and it cannot be &s;tated by Mr. Margarot, I have a different opinion of his abilities, it cannot be &s;tated by him that he is not liable for the proceedings of the Convention; it is clear, from other parts of the evidence, that the Gazetteer is &s;o far an authentic account of their proceedings, that they &s;up|ported it as individuals, and wi&s;hed it well, as I believe they do with all their hearts and with all their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, let us look to this Gazetteer, and let us &s;ee how far it &s;upplies any blank which may ari&s;e upon the peru&s;al of the minutes regarding this extraordinary Convention, and you will &s;ee that it effectually does &s;o, for you will find that the re|&s;olution which Mr. Aitche&s;on did not wi&s;h to have burnt, be|cau&s;e he thought their conduct was open and avowed, and what the world had a right to know; you find that the Pannel at the bar was wi&s;ely and prudently of an oppo&s;ite opinion; for it &s;ays, after &s;tating the proceedings of the Wedne&s;day, on which Citi|zen Mealmaker is in the chair, and where Mr. Callendar's mo|tion is rejected as to words, but approved of as to the &s;pirit of it;
<PB N="93" REF="027594_0093_0FD7BFBBED59BDC0">
and the next day, when the re&s;olution comes to be new <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, it &s;ays Citizen Sinclair, Citizen Pre&s;ident, your commit|tee appointed to attend Citizen Callendar's motion &s;at this forenoon, and I &s;hall now, if agreeable to the Convention, &s;ub|mit to their con&s;ideration the report of that committee. Fellow Citizens, you will feel this report to be of the la&s;t importance; it claims your mo&s;t &s;erious attention, and is to be decided by your united wi&s;dom, and &s;upported by your united integrity. The hou&s;e re&s;olved it&s;elf into a grand committee to con&s;ider of the report, which underwent a long di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and reviewed &s;everal amendments in the committee, and when the Conven|tion was re&s;umed, it pa&s;&s;ed unanimou&s;ly in the form of a decla|ration and re&s;olution: the minutes proved that re&s;olution was come to&punc; but being ordered to &s;tand the la&s;t article in the record of the proceedings of the Convention, we cannot in&s;ert it till the termination of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>That is the account in the Gazetteer, the my&s;tery of the blank is &s;o far cleared up, if Mr. Aitche&s;on is to be believed, that this was what Mr. Sinclair wi&s;hed to bu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">n, you have it in a faithful account of the proceedings in the Gazetteer, that it was to be left out till the termination of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion. You will con&s;ider if the hand of the magi&s;trate had not been rai&s;ed to &s;top their proceedings in the very middle of their career, whether it is po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a re&s;olution as this would even at the end of the proceedings have ever made its appearance. But Ro&s;s tells you, he concurs exactly in the &s;ame thing, that this re&s;olution ought to have been in the blank in the minutes, and therefore you have this di&s;tinctly proved, that re&s;olutions of a certain nature were come to in a &s;olemn and deliberate manner, unani|mou&s;ly and &s;olemnly in this Convention, which one man &s;ays Mr. Sinclair moved &s;hould be de&s;troyed, and which ano|ther &s;ays, and the Gazetteer confirms, was to be po&s;tponed to the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and which have never made their ap|pearance, and therefore the blank is completely explained; but you have better evidence yet, you have the evidence of Coborn and Ro&s;s, to almo&s;t every thing &s;tated in page five of the indict|ment. I de&s;ire, when you read that indictment, that you will lay out of your view altogether every thing but what is proved; every thing but what is &s;ufficient evidence&mdash;You are to look at the te&s;timony of Coborn, you are to look at the te&s;timony of Ro&s;s, you are to look at the Gazetteer, and to a &s;peech which I &s;hall read this moment, and which tally &s;o far as they go with the minutes, and if you are of opinion that that re&s;olution, &s;o far as it is proved, is one of a lawful nature, if you are of opi|nion that it is not of a direct &s;editious, nay of a trea&s;onable ten|dency, for if it had been followed by one &s;ingle act, in con&s;e|quence of it, if under that re&s;olution it had been proved that this Convention of Emergency had met, if it had been proved that they a&s;&s;embled under the&s;e circum&s;tances of &s;ecrecy, in any
<PB N="94" REF="027594_0094_0FD54DC0DB6609C0">
of the ca&s;es which I &s;hall ju&s;t now &s;hew you are proved, the per&s;ons who met would have been guilty of on overt act of high trea&s;on, under the &s;tatute of Edward III. which by the act of the 7th Queen Ann, is now the trea&s;on law of Scotland.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I beg your attention to the words in the indict|ment: it &s;tates that the Convention, <Q>con&s;idering the calami|tous con&s;equences of any act of the Legi&s;lature which may tend to deprive the whole or any part of the people of their undoubted right to meet either by them&s;elves, or by delega|tion, to di&s;cu&s;s any matter relative to their common intere&s;t, whether of a public or private nature; and holding the &s;ame to be totally incon&s;i&s;tent with the fir&s;t principles and &s;afety of &s;ociety, and al&s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of our known and acknowledged con&s;titutional liberties, do hereby declare, before God and the world, that we &s;hall follow the whole&s;ome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which may mi|litate again&s;t the con&s;titution of our country; and &s;hall con|tinue to a&s;&s;emble and con&s;ider of the be&s;t means by which we can accompli&s;h a real repre&s;entation of the people and an|nual election, until compelled to de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperior force.</Q>&mdash; This is not proved in words; but in a certain extent it is com|pletely proved by the te&s;timony of Coburn, by the te&s;timony of Ro&s;s, by the minutes and by the Gazetteer; for Mr. Coburn tells you, he remembers Mr. Callendar moving, that in ca&s;e of a Bill being brought into Parliament &s;imilar to the Iri&s;h Conven|tion Bill, that the people &s;hould meet and a&s;&s;ert their rights: afterwards the &s;pirit of the motion was retained, but extend|ing to certain other events, in which the Convention &s;hould likewi&s;e meet in ca&s;e of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the habeas corpus act, in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion, and in ca&s;e of landing foreign troops. A moti|on was made for a committee to appoint a place where the Con|vention of Emergency were to meet, which was to be a &s;ecret with them and the Secretary. He remembers Mr. Sinclair's motion being come to with peculiar &s;olemnity, and that the words before God and the world were u&s;ed either in the motion or in the deci&s;ive re&s;olution; he is certain it was in one or the other. He recol|lects he &s;aid they would pay no regard to any &s;uch Bill, if it pa&s;|&s;ed, or words to that purpo&s;e. I have the te&s;timony of Coburn, of who&s;e re&s;pectability I leave you to judge, deponing to the ma|terial parts of the indictment, that they were to meet to a&s;&s;ert their rights, that they would pay no regard any &s;uch Bill, if pa&s;&s;ed; and if they were to pay no regard to the Act, if pa&s;&s;ed, were they not guilty of an act of rebellion again&s;t the &s;tate, when they tell you, that if the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature con&s;i&s;ting of King, Lords, and Commons, &s;hould pa&s;s &s;uch an Act, if, in the plenitude of their wi&s;dom, they &s;hould think it right to do what Ireland has before thought it nece&s;&s;ary to do; and God forbid that, without any declaratory &s;tatute, there &s;hould not be law in Scotland to find men guilty of daring to put into a paper
<PB N="95" REF="027594_0095_0FD7BFCC6D410D70">
words of the import that Coburn has &s;worn to, that they would pay no regard to any &s;uch Act; the inference follows nece&s;&s;arily and unavoidably, though not proved, until compelled by &s;upe|rior force. Will you permit this, Gentlemen, let their conduct in life be ever &s;o unimpeached; I impeach none of them. God forbid I &s;hould look down upon the &s;hoemaker, or the mechanic, or con&s;ider him as le&s;s entitled to re&s;pect in his walk of life, than the proude&s;t peer that lives in this country. I wi&s;h that they, be they of what rank they may, would dwell with a little attention, and con&s;ider with care and accuracy the nature of the Con&s;titution which they enjoy, ere they ra&s;hly attempt ei|ther to invade its authority, as they have done here, or attempt to &s;ub&s;titute their own crude ideas, and prefer one of their own idle imaginations. Whatever be the ca&s;e with Mr. Margarot, I don't think he has that knowledge of the Con&s;titution; &s;ure I am, he has not that knowledge of law, after what I have heard to-day. I know nothing of him; but &s;ure I am, from what I did &s;ee of him, I cannot think, and I &s;hould be &s;orry that the fifteen men I now addre&s;s &s;hould think, that the Con&s;titution was &s;afely confided to &s;uch men in the line of life in which the&s;e men are; they cannot be fit for that duty which the Hi&s;tory of the World &s;hews has been with difficulty di&s;charged by legi&s;|lators of the highe&s;t characters, and of the fir&s;t abilities. Go back to ages pa&s;t, you will read of men who formed a &s;tate, and gave rules for its legi&s;lation, were rai&s;ed to the rank of heathen gods; you will read of men who, by forming a con&s;titution, and regulating its proceedings, obtained characters and names as eternal as the world it&s;elf, will the&s;e men be entitled to come forward, like Calder, who is placed in the univer&s;ity? Will the&s;e men be entitled to &s;tate them&s;elves as per&s;ons holding out to &s;uch poor deluded creatures that they are fitted to enter on &s;ubjects of that nature? That this country, con&s;i&s;ting of ten mil|lions of people, is to delegate the ta&s;k of legi&s;lation to &s;uch a &s;et of ignorant uninformed people&mdash;ignorant of the common prin|ciples of law and ju&s;tice, talking of books they never read, and declaiming upon &s;ubjects they know nothing of? It may indeed tend, and here I am &s;peaking directly to the point of criminat|ing this Pannel, if he was an attorney, which I don't know that he was, he has made an ill-u&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion; his crimina|lity is without excu&s;e; his guilt is indeed of a more atrocious na|ture. What is &s;edition but this; a convocating of ignorant, weak, and deluded people, under the pretext of redre&s;&s;ing grie|vances of any kind, and inflaming them again&s;t the Con&s;titution and the e&s;tabli&s;hed authority of their country. But this is the direct fact proved again&s;t Mr. Margarot, it is the point di&s;tinctly brought home to him; and under &s;uch circum&s;tances of re&s;i&s;t|ance, inculcated upon the part of the&s;e ringleaders, which in my mind, and I tru&s;t in yours, will &s;atisfy you that guilt was in his mind when he did &s;o, and will entitle you to lay your hands
<PB N="96" REF="027594_0096_0FD7BFC06D13E6D8">
upon your hearts and &s;ay, that he is guilty of endeavouring to &s;pread the contagion wide among people who knew not what they were about; which if they had followed his advice, if they had ro&s;e into tumult and di&s;order, might have brought them to an untimely end; and perhaps the&s;e three days pa&s;t may afford &s;ome idea of what might be the purpo&s;e of a&s;&s;embling &s;uch per|&s;ons together, if they had been a&s;&s;embled by Mr. Margarot as a Convention of Emergency; if they had been told by him, now is the time to a&s;&s;ert your rights. I a&s;&s;ume, that the&s;e three days pa&s;t within this city will &s;hew us what was the nature of that object which Mr. Margarot had in view, and what the purpo|&s;es, and what the manner in which in &s;uch an event they might have carried their &s;chemes into execution.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have now gone through every thing upon this part of the indictment; and certainly in arguing, and being ob|liged to quote con&s;iderably from papers, I mu&s;t have gone long|er into the ca&s;e than I had any idea of; but I tru&s;t I &s;hall, before I &s;it down, in a few words, go through what remains, and prove to your &s;atisfaction, that every part of the libel is clearly and di&s;|tinctly proved.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, Coburn tells you, that he thought the Iri&s;h Bill &s;apped the very vitals of the Con&s;titution of the Country; and he &s;ays it was to be kept a &s;ecret. If any illegal power inter|rupted their meeting, that is the rea&s;on he gives for the &s;ecrecy; that is to &s;ay, that if either the magi&s;tracy of this city, or Par|liament it&s;elf, or any &s;uch inimical power, they being clearly the per&s;ons to whom he alludes, are the cau&s;e of the &s;ecrecy; and it is all I a&s;k from him. You will con&s;ider whether it is not ju&s;t the thing I am &s;tating as the point in their view, that they were keeping it &s;ecret from tho&s;e who&s;e duty it was to check it, and prevent the con&s;equence that might ari&s;e from it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion I have already &s;tated to you was one of the ca&s;es under which the Convention was to meet, and I &s;hall not repeat what I have &s;aid upon that &s;ubject; but I tru&s;t that you will think with me, that the only and the nece&s;&s;ary conclu&s;ion is that which I have already &s;tated to you.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, having done with that part of the ca&s;e, I come to the next, which I ob&s;erved in the cour&s;e of my examination, and which I al&s;o ob&s;erved in the cour&s;e of the Pannel's &s;peech upon the &s;ubject, &s;eemed to be treated with very con&s;iderable con|tempt; and Mr. Aitche&s;on, a determined and bold-faced gen|tleman, told you his opinions in very &s;trong, forcible terms. He expre&s;&s;ed his idea, that the law of the country was come to a &s;ad pa&s;s. Indeed he did not under&s;tand &s;edition neither. And he was a man, from what I have &s;een of his abilities, I &s;hould have expected he would have known a little more upon the &s;ubject than Wardlaw or Clarke knew upon the &s;ubject. But he did not know what &s;edition was; but he tells you, that the law of the country was come to a &s;ad pa&s;s indeed, when the word citizen,
<PB N="97" REF="027594_0097_0FD7BFCDED10D5B0">
which he gloried in, was to con&s;titute a man criminal. And he told you, that the principles of this Convention were carried on in the &s;ame way, or very little different, from tho&s;e which marked the proceedings and conduct of the former Convention. If they were, all I can &s;ay is this, that the&s;e former Conventions kept their proceedings very much a &s;ecret; for if I had known that they had done &s;o, or come to any re&s;olutions &s;imilar to tho&s;e proved to day again&s;t this man, the members of that Convention &s;hould before now have &s;tood before the Jury of their country|men. If they did &s;o, then all that I have to &s;ay is, that they were more cautious, or they perhaps did not think that the time was quite ripe to expre&s;s what they have &s;ince expre&s;&s;ed. To be &s;ure, the term citizen, taken by it&s;elf, is an innocent and a proper term; I have u&s;ed it to-night: we are all fellow-citizens here to-night. And the word toc&s;in, whether it comes from France, or whether it comes from China, or any where el&s;e, I feel nothing criminal in that term taken by it&s;elf; nor in the fir&s;t year of Briti&s;h liberty; nor indeed the decades, which by the by I find in one of the plans for the &s;upport of the Gazetteer, that it &s;hall be divided into decades, and that each decade &s;hall take &s;o many copies of the Gazetteer, that is a Latin word; nor the fir&s;t &s;itting; in the &s;ame way all the other expre&s;&s;ions, which I will not run over, taken by them&s;elves, are &s;urely and unque&s;|tionably innocent; we all may u&s;e them in an innocent &s;en&s;e, without the &s;malle&s;t apprehen&s;ion, or the &s;malle&s;t blame. But here is the point, Gentlemen, upon which I found the charge of criminality; 'tis for this purpo&s;e that I collect the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, occurring in the proceedings of the&s;e minutes; and I collect them as links in the chain of evidence, to &s;hew that this man has been guilty of apeing and imitating the French Convention, as acting upon that model and that principle, as in the &s;ame way was done la&s;t year in Ireland, and was the cau&s;e of the Iri&s;h Par|liament pa&s;&s;ing that act; it is a prooof of the animus and the intent of the per&s;ons concerned in that meeting, that they took for them&s;elves the model and example of the pre&s;ent Convention of France, imitating it in every way in their power; and the conclu&s;ion is irre&s;i&s;tible, that if they dur&s;t have gone forward, or if an inva&s;ion had taken place, we might have found the&s;e men joining that band of invaders, whom we find them imitating and accommodating all their forms to, you will con&s;ider with your|&s;elves, laying your hands upon your hearts, can you, when you find in making it a ca&s;e or emergency, under which they were to meet in a place &s;ecret to all the world, which might be here, or might be in England, the rallying point where the Executive Power of the country could not di&s;cover them; can you he&s;itate one moment in thinking as I think, and as I believe, that if &s;uch an event had taken place, that men who form them&s;elves upon that model, and a&s;&s;umed as far as in them lay, and, as far as they
<PB N="98" REF="027594_0098_0FD7BFF12D20BFE8">
dur&s;t the expre&s;&s;ions of the French Convention, with which we are at pre&s;ent at war, and by whom we are threatened with that inva&s;ion, would have gone again&s;t the per&s;ons who were their own objects of imitation? or &s;hould we have found them endeavour|ing to e&s;tabli&s;h that which they have &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully e&s;tabli&s;hed in that country, univer&s;al &s;uffrage, one of the great objects for which this Convention was e&s;tabli&s;hed?</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you cannot expect written evidence of what pa&s;&s;ed in their minds, until the evil is gone to &s;uch an height, until the inva&s;ion has taken place, till the tumult or the in&s;urrection has happened, which the&s;e men have endeavoured to foment. Se|dition then would no longer be the crime: trea&s;on would be the &s;hape it would then a&s;&s;ume: it would then be the duty of every free and loyal &s;ubject to join hand in hand again&s;t the&s;e invaders, whom we have found in the moment of that inva&s;ion a&s;&s;embling in a &s;ecret place, as the delegates of thou&s;ands, and whom we find proving them&s;elves by every act by which it was po&s;&s;ible to prove them&s;elves, to be the &s;upporters and imitators of the French Convention. I call them French Conventioni&s;ts: It is the e&s;&s;ence of the charge again&s;t them: it is the point upon which I de&s;ire your attention. If they were the mere innocent Convention, or A&s;&s;embly, or A&s;&s;ociation, or Society for Reform in Parliament, be their reform never &s;o ab&s;urd, or the in&s;tru|ments of their meeting never &s;o ineffectual for the object, I &s;ay God forbid you &s;hould find them guilty to the extent of the mo&s;t trifling puni&s;hment which you can fix upon them; but if you find them directly avowing in equivocal and doubtful terms, that an inva&s;ion &s;hall be one of the ca&s;es in which they &s;hall a&s;&s;emble, not to &s;ay that which would be the glory of a loyal &s;ubject, to &s;a|crifice their live and fortunes to re&s;i&s;t the invaders; but if we find them, in&s;tead of that, &s;hewing their predilection for French forms, and I tru&s;t in God all they can be able to do, it is your duty and your province to dive into the rece&s;&s;es of the human mind, to con&s;ider the influence which ari&s;es from &s;uch proceed|ings, to con&s;ider, if you will not lay the hand of criminal ju&s;tice upon them, to quell the con&s;piracy before it bur&s;ts into light; or if the deluded people, I &s;peak of the inhabitants of this city, I &s;peak of the inhabitants of Scotland at large, and of what has pa&s;&s;ed within the&s;e three or four days, are &s;o much in the power of the&s;e &s;trangers who have lately come among&s;t us, are to come in an unu&s;ual mode to a court of criminal ju&s;tice either to over|awe that court, the pro&s;ecutor, or the jurymen; if they are to be indulging in unfair and &s;candalous a&s;per&s;ions, as that of packed juries, as that of impo&s;ing upon your under&s;tandings, it is for you to interfere and check the evil in its bud; now is the time, this is the moment for you to mark the di&s;approbation of their proceedings, and &s;top them, while it remains with a feature of &s;edition marked upon it verging upon trea&s;on, with &s;uch a tri|fling di&s;tinction, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for a lawyer to find
<PB N="99" REF="027594_0099_0FD54DC9172D45F8">
the difference. It &s;o little, that when the indictment was pre|ferred again&s;t Mr. Margarot, had it not been for the &s;peed with which it was nece&s;&s;ary to bring him before you, I &s;hould have laid the ca&s;e before the King's coun&s;el in England, as to the ap|pointment of a &s;ecret committee, which was &s;ub&s;equent to the re&s;olution of calling the Convention together, whether that <HI>per &s;e</HI> was not &s;ufficient to ground the charge of high-trea&s;on. Sure I am, but for the act of the 7th of Queen Anne, that the Gen|tlemen were far within the ca&s;e of Scotch trea&s;ons; and in that ca&s;e Mr. Margarot would have &s;tood at your bar tried for his life.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, before I &s;it down, let me return again to the evidence. Mr. Ro&s;s, I think George tells you, that he had heard of a Convention Bill, and of a number of He&s;&s;ians and Hanoverians to be landed in this country, that al&s;o was a ca&s;e when it was proper for the Convention to meet at the &s;e|cret place of meeting, that is to &s;ay, and it is the ca&s;e at this moment, I believe, that a body of He&s;&s;ians are pa&s;&s;ing towards France. If Parliament &s;hould choo&s;e to allow them to land upon this i&s;land, this was an objection of legi&s;lation; not that we could confide to the wi&s;dom of King, Lords, and Commons, but the Briti&s;h Convention for univer&s;al &s;uffrage was to decide alone what was to be done; a ca&s;e much of the &s;ame kind with the other, even in the way that Mr. Ro&s;s him&s;elf &s;tates it. But I will not wound the feelings of that worthy citizen (and I tru&s;t that he hears me), by &s;aying, that he concealed the truth, I will not &s;ay that; but he has forgot that mighty event which his bro|ther and Coburn &s;wore to, which mu&s;t have &s;truck the mind and ears of every man who heard it; but his memory is a frail one, and with that ob&s;ervation I leave him.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, we are now coming near to a clo&s;e. You will find a variety of other evidence, much of the &s;ame nature in number three of the inventory. You will find one of the docu|ments material to be attended to in con&s;idering this que&s;tion, Whether the Convention is a &s;editious or a fair Convention? for that is the gi&s;t of the que&s;tion which you are to try, and upon which you are to make up your mind. Now the&s;e papers are traced home to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Margarot. Mr. Aitche&s;on, in his character of A&s;&s;i&s;tant Secretary to the Convention, iden|tifies a paper to which he tells you in this Convention he put his &s;ub&s;cription 'Hints on the que&s;tion of union;' and in the in&s;ide are three or four different papers, which the witne&s;&s;es who made the &s;earch &s;wear were inclo&s;ed in it, and all relate to the &s;elf|&s;ame &s;ubject; and the only other odd circum&s;tance which was thought of &s;o much con&s;equence in this ca&s;e was, in that &s;olemn way the appointment of that committee of union, of which Mr. Margarot was the chairman.</P>
<P>He appears to be the leader of this committee of union be|tween England and Scotland; a union which the&s;e Gentlemen, it &s;eems, had authority to make; a union which we unfortunately

have been deceived, as well as our fathers, in dreaming that we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a union that we thought we had enjoyed &s;ince the year 1707, which Mr. Aitche&s;on told us was nothing like the union brought about by this convention, with &s;o much &s;olemnity; a wild &s;ycophant union, I think, he called it; and Mr. Margarot is the per&s;on who takes the active part in this committee. Let us &s;ee what it amounts to. I &s;hall take the paper it&s;elf which Pater&s;on, a man who, much to his credit, has &s;eceded from that meeting: he, as the head of his &s;ection, admits that the paper was drawn up in his &s;ection, and was by him &s;ent in a letter to the Convention. Mr. Margarot de&s;ired to know, How are you certain that paper was in the Convention? I will tell Mr. Mar|garot how I am certain of it. Mr. Aitche&s;on &s;ub&s;cribes it at the back, "Hints re&s;pecting the Union;" and &s;ays, it mu&s;t be put upon that paper in its reception; where Mr. Pater&s;on tells you, he &s;ent it in the common form from his &s;ection, which met in the morning, to the Convention, which met in the evening, and of which Mr. Aitche&s;on was A&s;&s;i&s;tant Secretary; and there is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that it did not reach the place of its de&s;tination, the Ma&s;ons' Lodge, at the foot of the Black Friars Wynd. And what is it; "Hints upon the que&s;tion of Union." Fir&s;t, That the people of Great Britain, di&s;claiming any di&s;tinction of Scotch and Engli&s;h do now and for ever unite them&s;elves into one ma&s;s and indi&s;&s;oluble union. Then it goes on, Make known to all concerned, in exclu&s;ive terms, that this &s;hall be the motto:&mdash; Re&s;toration of Rights. What rights? Univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual parliaments; a thing that never did, and that never can, exi&s;t. Let them go back to the Hi&s;tory of England; let them go back to the deepe&s;t antiquity, it never did exi&s;t. Tho&s;e people, of whom Mr. Margarot &s;eems to be the gho&s;tly father, had not heard of the Bill of Rights, nor the claim of rights; and knew not what rights they had lo&s;t.</P>
<P>And, Gentlemen, I have been taught by every writer of the laws of foreign countries; I have been taught by every enlight|ened foreigner who writes upon the &s;ubject; I have been taught by every Briton who ever &s;tated an opinion with regard to it, that &s;ince the revolution, this country, originally free, re&s;i&s;ted every invader, till gradually matured through centuries, by the &s;low mellowing hand of time, not by a&s;&s;ociations of &s;uch people as we have &s;een to-day, but it was clear that at that time, and till within the&s;e two years, we were the free&s;t nation upon the face of the earth; but if it be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute freedom that univer&s;al &s;uffrage, or annual parliaments&mdash;that univer&s;al &s;uffrage was a kind of proof of being free, we never have been free from all eternity, and are not free at this pre&s;ent moment. I hope in God, in that &s;en&s;e we never &s;hall, becau&s;e that never can take place, for the be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible rea&s;ons, as I believe the late Soame Jenyns &s;ays. It is the be&s;t plan of the whole, &s;ays he, for the be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible rea&s;ons, becau&s;e it is impracticable

<STAGE>(goes on reading the paper)</STAGE> that all occurrences may be known from one end of the kingdom to the other, to in&s;truct every indi|vidual of this one great but indivi&s;ible ma&s;s, in this way greeting together the inhabitants of this free country, France, to reject that mighty combination formed again&s;t them. Still they run upon the French expre&s;&s;ions in every part of their minutes, in every &s;peech in their Gazetteer, continually recurring to French words, French terms, and French expre&s;&s;ions. In another mo|tion, by James Gartlay, which Aitche&s;on volunteered in telling me was not evidence again&s;t Mr. Margarot, but it proves being found upon his per&s;on, it proves the nature of that convention, of which he was not only a member, but an active leading in|&s;trument, it is al&s;o marked upon the back by Aitche&s;on, and this motion is that the delegation &s;igned John Gartley, who is the town drummer of Arni&s;ton near Gla&s;gow, that the Convention took into their &s;erious con&s;ideration the nece&s;&s;ity of dividing the country into departments, in order that the friends of the people may have an opportunity of meeting in the particular depart|ment to which they belong, and thus form a &s;ort of Provincial Convention, that they may become more particularly acquainted with each other. In the names of the delegates, James Gartley.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the honour of the &s;itting appears to be given by the French Convention, to per&s;ons they wi&s;h to favour, &s;o we find in the minutes, among other in&s;ignia of the honours of the Briti&s;h Convention, Secretary Skirving &s;tated, that he had ju&s;t now received five &s;hillings from an unknown hand, for the u&s;e of the Convention. Honourable mention in the minutes was ordered to be made of this patriotic gift. Upon my word I never was in the French Convention, and I hope I never &s;hall, but I &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed, from what I read in the new&s;papers, that I was reading of the French Convention in Paris. Citizen Ca|lendar moved, that no per&s;on be allowed the honour of the &s;it|ting, without the recommendation of two per&s;ons; it is a favour not to be be&s;towed ra&s;hly or lightly; which, with amendments, pa&s;&s;ed unanimou&s;ly. Afterwards it was moved that captain John&s;tone, and I am extremely &s;orry to find him here, if he is the individual to whom I allude at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e it may per|haps compel other proceedings again&s;t him: but when he read an account in the new&s;paper of the &s;entence of Holt, the printer, of Newark, for re-printing the duke of Richmond's and Mr. Pitt's re&s;olutions upon parliamentary reform, it was moved, that Captain John&s;tone be admitted to the honours of the &s;itting.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, there is one other circum&s;tance that I cannot help ju&s;t in pa&s;&s;ing to take notice of, and it is that of a compul&s;ory attendance enforced upon tho&s;e per&s;ons who might have the misfortune to be deluded in a ra&s;h unthinking moment, into a participation of their proceedings, to &s;hame them from doing, as Mr. Pater&s;on, much to his honour did, return back to his duty. In this manner you will find, that no delegate is to leave
<PB N="102" REF="027594_0102_0FD54DCD6E106F48">
his po&s;t, or is to get permi&s;&s;ion of ab&s;ence from it, till he obtains a new delegation, a &s;ub&s;titute in his place to act for him; we &s;aw too much of this I think pointed at to-day. Mr. Margarot &s;aid, he would not touch upon the &s;ore heel of Pater&s;on, in the que&s;tion propo&s;ed to the witne&s;s, which he refu&s;ed to an&s;wer, and which the ju&s;tice of the Court would not enforce for this highly favoured Pannel, who has been favoured more than any Scotchman would have been. He &s;aid, he would not touch the &s;ore heel of Pater&s;on, for having done that which I am &s;ure you will join with me in thinking was to his honour; and God knows, when we look at tho&s;e we &s;aw here this morning, what this Pannel will have to an&s;wer for; but I tru&s;t what has been done this day will make them &s;tudy the law and con&s;titution of the country, before they give an opinion upon it, and before they tru&s;t again to &s;uch leaders as Mr. Margarot and Mr. Skir|ving. In one of the papers, Citizen Wil&s;on, and another, re|que&s;ted leave of ab&s;ence to be granted them; and it was moved that all the delegates &s;hould have letters to return immediately, and remain at their po&s;ts till the important bu&s;ine&s;s daily intro|duced in the Convention, &s;hall be properly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; and in page 100 of the minutes, Citizen Scott moved, that before any delegate from the country &s;hall leave his po&s;t, he &s;hall write to his con&s;tituents to &s;end another in his room. Agreed to, nem. con.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the two in&s;tances which I have given are perfectly &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that in this re&s;pect al&s;o, as in their declaring them&s;elves permanent, which is proved by many witne&s;&s;es, and which is proved by the Gazetteer, that they, in every paper the mo&s;t minute, imitate in every re&s;pect the proceedings of the French Convention. In one word, I leave this point for your con&s;ideration; repeating again, that tho&s;e words taken of them|&s;elves, or in any different circum&s;tances, would have them&s;elves been idle, and that which you could have grounded no verdict upon; but taking them in conjunction with the evidence of the Gazetteer, and the parole evidence this day upon your table, certainly do go to the point. Is it a &s;editious meeting or not, in as much as it is proved it was a meeting calculated for the purpo&s;e of overawing Parliament, and re&s;i&s;ting any act which might pa&s;s until compelled to de&s;i&s;t by &s;uperior force; and that conduct followed by their adopting every form of that country to which I am &s;o often alluding, if you are of that opinion, you will find a verdict in my favour, for with regard to his being a ringleader in this bu&s;ine&s;s and being a man who conducted the&s;e Committees the evidence upon that point is &s;o clear, it is in|volved in every word I have now read; the moment you have come to a determination upon the one point, it &s;hews, that he is a principal in the guilt of being a Member of that Conven|tion, and a ringleader in it, as &s;uch, he is more re&s;pon&s;ible than

the poor creatures whom you have &s;een to day, and who were under his guidance.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am afraid I tre&s;pa&s;s more upon your time, much more than I had any intention of doing, when I ro&s;e; but I can|not help taking notice of one thing which dropped from the gentleman at the bar, in the commencement of this day's trial he told us, that he had cited &s;everal per&s;ons, who were not evi|dences, this day upon the trial: men bearing the highe&s;t offices in the &s;tate, and at pre&s;ent di&s;charging the duties of tho&s;e im|portant offices in England. And he brought evidence which I dare &s;ay is the ca&s;e, that, under the letters of exculpation, which i&s;&s;ue of cour&s;e, and in which he can fill up any name that he plea&s;es, that he &s;ubpoenaed them in London by the forms of the law of England; in the cour&s;e of &s;omething which was not a very proper argument upon the &s;ubject Mr. Margarot cho&s;e to refer; and if I am not mi&s;taken, I thank him for the expre&s;&s;ion; he referred to my&s;elf and to my own candour, if the public Pro&s;e|cutor had not higher powers in bringing witne&s;&s;es to this court than what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. I have no difficulty, at all times and &s;ea&s;ons, to give my opinion to a Pannel, whether I am bound to do it or not, and I was ill-prepared then to give him an an&s;wer; but I &s;aid I had no more power of compelling witne&s;&s;es to come into this court, than the meane&s;t criminal at the bar. Our rights, in that re&s;pect, and our powers are the &s;ame. I will give him an in&s;tance of it: A noted in&s;tance occurred twelve years ago, when one of your Lord&s;hips filled the office of Solicitor General of Scotland. A man of the name of M'Gee, a carrier of letters, was brought under an accu&s;ation of having embezzled letters and &s;tolen money intru&s;ted to his charge. The principal evidence was a woman, a relation of his own, and who, immediately after the fact was di&s;covered, reitred to Eng|land. The Solicitor General brought his indictment again&s;t him. I at that time appeared as coun&s;el for the pannel. The trial was adjourned from week to week, and from day to day; becau&s;e this material evidence, the woman, would not come, for obvious rea&s;ons, within the juri&s;diction of the courts of law, to give her te&s;timony again&s;t the pannel. And now did &s;he at la&s;t come? Having been concerned with him, &s;he came at la&s;t becau&s;e means were round to notify to her, that if &s;he did not come to her duty as the witne&s;s again&s;t the pannel, &s;he her&s;elf would be tried in England, as an approver of the crime; and therefore &s;he came to &s;ave and redeem her own life, and gave evidence, as &s;he was bound to do; and which &s;he would have been compelled to do, if &s;he had been in this country; and I hope that in&s;tance will &s;atisfy him, that even the powers of the public Pro&s;ecutor are ju&s;t exactly what his are: that he mu&s;t take his chance of bringing witne&s;&s;es from a foreign country, as we do; and if he is not &s;ucce&s;sful there is no help for it.</P>
<P>But, gentlemen, if it is meant by &s;aying that the&s;e men have
<PB N="104" REF="027594_0104_0FD7BFC36D24AFB8">
not obeyed the citation, if it is meant to found any plea of fa|vour upon it, I leave the Pannel in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any benefit he may derive from it; but if you were to give weight to &s;uch an objection as that, &s;eeing the rea&s;on of it at pre&s;ent, there is not a pannel who would not be entitled to the &s;ame benefit, be his crime what it may, who will not tell you he has witne&s;&s;es in Ger|many, in France, in America, or in the Indies, and you mu&s;t al|ways take the pannel's word for it; and you will con&s;ider if there is any po&s;&s;ibility of doing duty to your&s;elves or your country, if you receive excu&s;es of that kind.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, before I &s;it down, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve it was &s;aid, that in all their preten&s;ions they were not afraid of what they were about. I omitted to mention one very material paper, which I tru&s;t will &s;atisfy you that the Gentlemen were perfectly aware of the danger of what they were about; in a letter from Mr. Hardy, who is the &s;ecretary of the London Corre&s;ponding Soci|ety, which was found in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Hardy, after a long account of what was going on, and telling him, that they had &s;ent draughts, and complaining of the &s;hort coming in of the funds which were &s;ub&s;cribed, it &s;eems, for the carrying Mr. Gerald down to this country; which, he &s;ays, had fallen la|mentably &s;hort of their expectations; and at la&s;t concludes thus: <Q>I have to inform you of the wi&s;h of the Society, that you would favour them with the number of delegates in the Con|vention from England; al&s;o and how the civil and military power reli&s;hes your meeting.</Q> Upon the 8th of November, 1793, a few days after Mr. Margarot and Mr. Gerald arrived in this city, upon an object which they are not a&s;hamed or afraid to avow, an object of the public good, and of Scotland in parti|cular, it is &s;omething extraordinary that it &s;hould come into the head of the &s;ecretary of the meeting, by which they were ap|pointed, to a&s;k the que&s;tion, how the civil and military power reli&s;hed their meeting. The military power has never inter|fered: it cannot interfere to check &s;uch meetings as the&s;e though the con&s;equences of &s;uch meetings, I hope and tru&s;t, never will be &s;uch as to render the civil power compelled to adopt that la&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure; though, were I to look at the &s;peech of Mr. Gerald, &s;tated in the Gazetteer, mentioned in the minutes, and which he gave immediately after that &s;o|lemn re&s;olution was come to, I will not at this hour trouble you with quoting it, it would be clear to demon&s;tration, that Mr. Gerald at that moment &s;hews, in &s;trict terms, what is his mean|ing, that this re&s;olution was come to, with the purpo&s;e of re&s;i&s;t|ing lawful authority by force, as Coborn tells you, paying no regard whatever to it, though pa&s;&s;ed by the Legi&s;lature; in that &s;peech referred to in the minutes, and in the Gazetteer, he &s;ays, I ri&s;e to congratulate the Convention on the adoption of this re|&s;olution, not only on the propriety of the mea&s;ure it&s;elf, but on that unanimity and &s;olemnity with which it is pa&s;&s;ed: then goes
<PB N="105" REF="027594_0105_0FD54DD2A0DCEB08">
on a long &s;tory, with regard to the Iri&s;h bill. But the conclu|&s;ion is this, though I could not get a copy of this bill, the heads which I have read are &s;ufficiently explanatory of its dete&s;table principles, which was a bill pa&s;&s;ed for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of preventing the meeting of a Convention formed upon French models, and imitating French politics. I read the other day a &s;peech of one of the able&s;t men in the Iri&s;h Parliament upon that &s;ubject. The object of that bill was to check a &s;ociety of united Iri&s;hmen; a &s;ociety al&s;o with whom I have the honour to be ac|quainted; a &s;ociety which &s;ent &s;ome papers to this country of &s;o &s;editious a nature, that even the fir&s;t convention refu&s;ed to re|ceive it, as being a trea&s;onable paper, for which the unhappy mover is now &s;uffering the puni&s;hment that the law has award|ed. He goes on: I hope the motion, which has pa&s;&s;ed this night, will convince the mini&s;ter, that we are determined to guard again&s;t every attempt that may be made to deprive us of our rights; and, though by &s;ome it may be thought a bold, by others a daring mea&s;ure; yet it will be found the be&s;t for &s;ecur|ing the peace of the country: for if &s;uch a law were &s;uffered to pa&s;s, if men were not allowed to utter their complaints, a num|ber of rancorous pa&s;&s;ions would ari&s;e, and we &s;hould &s;eek to ap|peal to that la&s;t terrible deci&s;ion, the event of which is uncer|tain; but which God and nature allow. If the &s;ervility of the people had been le&s;s, if they had dared to meet, and in place of murmuring, had told the rulers, that there was danger in &s;eek|ing to deprive them of their liberties, we need not have had that re&s;olution to have recurred to to-night; but when I &s;aw the calm deliberate countenance of every one pre&s;ent, and the &s;o|lemn manner in which it was pa&s;&s;ed, I was convinced that it was not only a re&s;olution of words, but a rule of action. This is the commentary which Mr. Gerald gives to that re&s;olution, which I have already &s;tated as being compo&s;ed in artful ambiguous terms, and to which I have affixed &s;o criminal and &s;o guilty a conclu&s;ion. It appears to me, and I tru&s;t will appear to you, that the purport of that re&s;olution ambiguou&s;ly worded, and come to with &s;uch awful &s;olemnity, was a re&s;olution that, in any of tho&s;e emergencies, if they had happened, was not to be a re|&s;olution of words, but a rule of action; you are to con&s;ider whe|ther that is to be &s;uffered; and I know, becau&s;e it is the common law of the country, that your powers, as Jurymen, are &s;ufficient to check &s;uch conventions. If &s;uch men are to meet to con&s;ider what are their rights, and what ought to entitle them to that la&s;t and terrible deci&s;ion, the event of which is uncertain; but which God and nature allows. If you permit that to be allowed, where is the &s;ecurity of your laws, your lives, or your liberties? Where is the protection which this government gives to all, high or low, rich or poor, if the&s;e men's opinions, be they ever &s;o learned, are to be &s;et up in oppo&s;ition to the Briti&s;h Parliament; or if they are to judge in what point they are to recur to that la&s;t
<PB N="106" REF="027594_0106_0FD7BFF42F7B8868">
and terrible deci&s;ion, which comes to that which we &s;ee in a neighbouring country, where blood and deva&s;tation are the cer|tain con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, before I conclude, &s;omething was &s;aid, and I hope I vindicated you; in the commencement of my argument; &s;ome|thing was &s;aid about the Juries of this country, &s;omething was &s;aid again&s;t my&s;elf and the other &s;ervants of the Crown. If he means the &s;ervants of the Crown in this country, I unque&s;tiona|bly &s;tand among&s;t them. It is &s;aid that we are the per&s;ons guilty of Sedition; that we &s;owed &s;edition between our ma&s;ter and our fellow &s;ubjects; and that we are the proper per&s;ons to &s;tand at that bar; that to us are to be imputed the offences with which I have charged him. Upon that point you mu&s;t determine, and I feel not the lea&s;t difficulty in thinking that upon that charge I &s;hall meet with a compleat acquittal: all that I now &s;ay, that &s;tanding in the &s;ituation which I do, and ably a&s;&s;i&s;ted as I am, I have never brought any indictment again&s;t any man for any of|fence, I never opened in my life a bundle of papers which were laid before me, containing the ca&s;e of a propo&s;ed criminal, with|out an awful feeling upon my mind of the delicacy and the ex|tent of that duty which depended upon the exerci&s;e of my un|der&s;tanding, and con&s;ulting my con&s;cience upon the &s;ubject. If you differ with me upon this occa&s;ion, I &s;hould at lea&s;t hope, if it is po&s;&s;ible we can differ upon the &s;ubject, that you will not think that I have brought any improper or oppre&s;&s;ive pro&s;ecu|tion before you; at lea&s;t, if I am guilty of &s;editiou&s;ly perverting the duties of my office to any purpo&s;e, I &s;hall look back with &s;ome con&s;olation that hitherto I have received the be&s;t &s;upport, which comes home to a man's con&s;cience, the unanimous opi|nions of a jury of my country. Something was &s;aid of being a place-man and a pen&s;ioner. I am a place-man, it is true; I have been ten years in two high &s;ituations; and I have and am unque&s;tionably liable to that unfa&s;hionable imputation of the Briti&s;h Convention; that even the boy they called exulted that he was not a pen&s;ioner. I plead guilty to the charge of being a place-man; as to a pen&s;ioner I am not, I &s;hould feel my&s;elf mean indeed in my own eyes, if, by accepting the &s;ituation I now hold, my independence was injured in the &s;malle&s;t re&s;pect. I have been, by accidental circum&s;tances, early brought forward to tho&s;e &s;ituations, if I found them militating again&s;t the dictates of my own mind, I tru&s;t, with all the emolument of it, nothing &s;hould tempt me to retain it, or prevent me from throwing it up. I feel that I have done nothing but brought the guilty to ju&s;tice; and as to what they may &s;ay, I care not for it. They have my full approbation: they have a better thing, they have a right to attack me upon that &s;core; as to a pen&s;ion I have none, nor am I liable to &s;uch an imputation. I have, from the earlie&s;t period of my life, born in this place, from the moment I came to that bar, I have &s;upported my&s;elf; and, were I to be turned out to|morrow,
<PB N="107" REF="027594_0107_0FD7BFB52EB21A00">
I &s;hould retire behind that bar, and my friends round me, as free of the public money, as poor and as independent a man as I was in 1784, when I was fir&s;t introduced within in. I beg pardon for having deviated from that &s;trict line of my duty; but having been attacked, and probably &s;hall again be attacked as a placeman and a pen&s;ioner, which is the cant phra&s;e of the&s;e gentlemen of the Briti&s;h Convention, I thought proper to &s;ay &s;o much before I &s;at down, and before I call upon you, which, I hope and tru&s;t will be the ca&s;e, to return that verdict which I think is founded upon the evidence, that this man is guilty of the crime of Sedition with which I have charged him.</P>

<P>Gentlemen, the public Pro&s;ecutor has &s;aid, that I attempted, both in doors and out, to &s;hake the confidence of the people, with regard to a Jury; and he afterwards with truth added, that a Jury was the brighte&s;t privilege of Engli&s;hman.&mdash;So it is, where a Jury is faithful to its tru&s;t&mdash;it is the greate&s;t privilege the Eng|li&s;h Con&s;titution knows of; becau&s;e, Gentlemen of the Jury, when you are hone&s;t, you &s;tand not between the law and the accu&s;ed, but between tho&s;e in power and the accu&s;ed;&mdash;you &s;ee the due execution of the laws:&mdash;you &s;tand between the accu&s;er and the man who is perhaps weaker than the accu&s;er, either in tongue or in knowledge; and as he has thought proper to avail him&s;elf of that &s;uperority and to carry it &s;orth, I will undoubt|edly yield to him in regard to talents and eloquence, but for the &s;oundne&s;s of my doctrine I will not yield to him.&mdash;Gentlemen, I never attempted to prejudice the people again&s;t a Jury. I ever will lift up my voice again&s;t any act of iniquity, in impannelling a Jury,&mdash;again&s;t every act of iniquity, in trying to mi&s;lead a Jury, or in trying to influence a Jury, even if the man on the Bench tries to influence a Jury, I &s;hall try to &s;top him, I &s;hall withhold him, and tell him, it is not his duty, though he &s;its there as Judge, and I &s;tand here as criminal, it is my right as a Briton, to keep him within the bounds of his duty, to keep him clo&s;e to the execution of the laws, if he attempts to depart from them in any one in&s;tance.&mdash;With the &s;ame &s;pirit of inflamma|tion, the public Pro&s;ecutor has &s;welled out the trea&s;onable mat|ter which he &s;ays lies on the table; and he is obliged in the end, to tell you, that if it appears to you that the Briti&s;h Convention really had no &s;editious motives, if they were only, <HI>bona fide,</HI> &s;eeking a Reform in Parliament, whether it was to be by annual Parliaments, or whether it was to be attended with unver&s;al &s;uf|frage, or in whatever way it may take place, yet that Convention mu&s;t be innocent; but &s;ays he, you mu&s;t concur with me, that the parole and written evidence are more than &s;ufficient to prove me

guilty; and adds a very curious rea&s;oning:&mdash;he &s;ays, if you wait till you have po&s;itive proof, it will be too late; therefore, make ha&s;te, avail your&s;elves of the pre&s;umptive proof that I give you, and condemn him, which is to &s;ay, &s;port with the lives,&mdash;&s;port with the liberties of Engli&s;hmen, for fear of accidents befalling you hereafter.&mdash;Is that the language of mercy?&mdash;Is that the lan|guage of the Con&s;titution?&mdash;Is it the language of the Laws?&mdash; He calls his proofs in the fir&s;t in&s;tance &s;olid and convincing; al|though, at la&s;t, he is obliged to have recour&s;e to that &s;ubterfuge: he &s;ays it amounts to more than &s;edition, and arraigns the igno|rance of the Members of that Convention at the &s;ame time that he arraigns their wickedne&s;s, that they pretend to be ignorant of what really is &s;edition; and yet he does not deign to inform them.&mdash;He &s;ays, it is as &s;trictly defined as murder, but he does not give you that definition; he only &s;ays, we are guilty of Se|dition.&mdash;Now &s;edition mu&s;t be &s;ome act; it cannot be a concealed operation of the mind, it mu&s;t be an overt act: and yet he wants you to judge not of our overt acts, but of our intentions; which, all the witne&s;&s;es have agreed in &s;aying, were peaceful, orderly, and &s;eemingly legal. I &s;ay &s;eemingly, becau&s;e, as there is that idea of our appearance being different from our real intention, I put the word &s;eeming into their mouths; but I profe&s;s to you that our intentions perfectly coincided with our operations.&mdash; He acknowledges the right of the &s;ubject to addre&s;s the king or petition the Parliament; and it is well that he acknowledges it. &mdash;The affront upon your under&s;tandings; I repeat it, the affront upon your under&s;tandings would be too gro&s;s, were he not to acknowledge that freemen have a right to petition for redre&s;s, when they think them&s;elves abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>You are not to judge (a curious rea&s;oning) Gentlemen you are not judge upon any particular fact;&mdash;you are not to judge merely upon the evidence brought again&s;t me;&mdash;you are not to judge upon tho&s;e trivial matters brought forth to night, which apply entirely to me; but you are to judge from the contexture of the whole. You are to judge from papers that are to crimi|nate Skirving, Brown, Sinclair, Callendar; and, as I under&s;tand there are a great number more again&s;t whom indictments are making out, the&s;e papers are to criminate all; and the contex|ture is to criminate all. He has wandered far from the indict|ment; he a&s;&s;erts of his authority, however, it is but ju&s;t that, while he allows you the talent of prying into the hearts of men, it is but right, he &s;hould retain &s;ome &s;hare of the &s;ame penetra|tion; and therefore with that &s;agacity which he claims, he &s;ays that our intentions were po&s;itively to join the invaders of Bri|tain, let them be who they would, he does not name them, and then he de&s;ires you, in a mo&s;t pathetic manner, to lay your hands upon your hearts, and &s;ee if &s;uch men ought not to be pro|nounced traitors to their country. Undoubtedly men doing &s;o would be traitors to their country; but how does he prove that
<PB N="110" REF="027594_0110_0FD54DDAE047EE68">
was our intention? He brings you forward far more convincing proof than writtten evidence; he brings you forward a blank to grove our guilt. He acknowledges that no notice has been taken of three prior Conventions; and yet it will appear to you, gen|tlemen, by tho&s;e who have attended the&s;e prior Conventions, that this Convention acted exactly upon the &s;ame plan; therefore the laws of the land were either a&s;leep at that time, or they are over vigilant at this. He calls us a &s;et of French Conventioni&s;ts. I do not believe there were five men in the Convention that can &s;peak French. I do not believe that there were five men who had an adequate idea of France; and it does not appear, from the evidence that has been brought before you, that any &s;ingle member of the Convention has any intercour&s;e whatever with France; but yet it is criminal in us to adopt certain terms. Tho&s;e terms, taken by them&s;elves, he tells you, are not criminal; but take them, at this pre&s;ent cri&s;is, altogether, form a ma&s;s of guilt which it really hurts him to mention, he is &s;o tender. However, to &s;upport this allegation, he does not bring any proof; he gives it merely as an a&s;&s;ertion; and which is as legal an authority, as be undoubtedly held tho&s;e orders which he gave to Mr. David|&s;on, the Sheriff Sub&s;titute; and which, by the bye, he acknow|ledges. He reflects upon me as being, or pretending to be, an Engli&s;hman. Dare he doubt it, or dare he di&s;pute it&mdash;I have been, I acknowledge it, obnoxious to his uncle or father, or whoever he is, in London and &s;everal other Members of the Ad|mini&s;tration. Tho&s;e who profit by the &s;poils of the nation, tho&s;e who once were friendly to a Reform in Parliament, but now they have got into the enjoyment of the good things of the trea|&s;ury, &s;eek no more that reform. Had I been a foreigner I &s;hould have been long ere now &s;ent abroad under the Alien Act.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, he alleges again&s;t me, as an article of accu&s;ation, a motion &s;aid to be made by me; and he then reverts to the te&s;|timony of Ro&s;s and Coburn, and &s;upports it by other charges of certain forms which Mr. Callender (who, it &s;eems, has run from his bail in a mo&s;t di&s;graceful manner) wi&s;hed to introduce into the Convention&mdash;A Reform of Parliament, he will not admit&mdash; he calls it (but it remains for the nation to determine, whether he calls it rightly or not) a change of the Con&s;titution. A Re|form undoubtedly would make a change, but it would not be in the Con&s;titution; though, to be &s;ure, a change from &s;ickne&s;s to health is &s;o far a change in the Con&s;titution; but it is po&s;&s;ible that you may recover your pri&s;tine health, and make no altera|tion in your former Con&s;titution? you only do away your di&s;|ea&s;e; and that is the way in which a Reform is meant to operate. He pleads much again&s;t univer&s;al Suffrage, and annual Parlia|ments. Indeed annual parliaments he touches more tenderly upon. However, the &s;ame power that made them from annual to triennal, and from triennial to &s;eptennial, may very likely go on to make them for life, or even hereditary.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="027594_0111_0FD7C05767A16A90">But to &s;hew that univer&s;al Suffrage has taken place, I will give you a quotation from a Scotch Author. The Lord Advo|cate has &s;aid, it could not take place for the be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible rea&s;ons, (and I have heard that twice in this Court) becau&s;e it is impracticable. A Lord, learned in the law, and who&s;e autho|rity none here will deny, Lord Kaims, &s;ays, that, <Q>with regard to this matter one thing is certain, that the <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem</HI> was compiled in the days of one of our Davids. The author, whoever he be, declares that he was commanded by King David to compile this work with the coun&s;el and advice of his whole realm.</Q> There, Gentleman, you &s;ee it is not the ad|vice of repre&s;entatives; not the advice of individuals; but it was the advice of his whole realm. The &s;ame Lord Kaims does not fix a Government, or a Con&s;titution to any one particular point. He does not tell you that the Con&s;titution of Great Bri|tain is the very be&s;t that ever exi&s;ted from all eternity, as our learned Lord does; or that it will endure to all eternity, but he &s;ays, <Q>Government is one of the arts which nece&s;&s;ity has &s;ugge&s;ted, which time and experience have ripened, and which is &s;u&s;ceptible of improvements without end. It mu&s;t al&s;o be the privilege of every Society to improve upon its go|vernment.</Q>. There you &s;ee, Gentlemen, there you &s;ee, peo|ple of this country, that it admits of improvements without end; and therefore that which is good to day may be better to-morrow. Lord Kaims &s;ays, <Q>it is the privilege of every Society to im|prove upon its government;</Q> and what &s;ignifies the privi|lege, if we are not to have the enjoyment of it. I will warrant the learned Lord, that whatever privileges he enjoys, in his &s;itu|ation, he would not think them privileges, if he was debarred from the enjoyment of them&mdash;Then, why &s;hould a nation be deprived of that which would be a lo&s;s to an individual, who&s;e intere&s;t it is that the government &s;hould be good. Is it the in|tere&s;t of the few, or the intere&s;t of the many?&mdash;Undoubtedly it is the intere&s;t of the many. It is the concern of the many, and con&s;equently the intere&s;t of the many. He continues,&mdash; <Q>It mu&s;t al&s;o be the privilege of every &s;ociety to improve upon its government, as well as its manufactures, hu&s;bandry or other art invented for their good</Q>&mdash;Here you &s;ee if an im|provement is admi&s;&s;ible in an art, it is &s;o in government. <Q>No particular form therefore can be e&s;&s;ential, as no particular form is preferable to another.</Q> This is a Scotch Lord who &s;peaks, <Q>un|le&s;s by having a greater tendency to promote its end&mdash;the good of the &s;ociety.</Q> Therefore, how excellent &s;oever our Con&s;titu|tion may be in its pre&s;ent form of three e&s;tates, and in the pre&s;ent mo&s;t excellent mo&s;t immaculate ways of electing Members of Par|lament; yet, if there is a better mode of electing Members of Par|liament, it is not only our right, but our duty to do it; yet meet|ings for that purpo&s;e are deemed &s;editious, although there is

no overt act of Sedition, but merely the con&s;truction of the pub|lic Accu&s;er, for the doctrine that he has pleaded is, that before a man is guilty you &s;hall hang him, that he may not become a rogue.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, another great point is the committee of &s;ecrecy; that galls him &s;orely. Undoubtedly we ought to have told him what we were about. We &s;aid we had no &s;ecrets, and immedi|ately after appointed a committee of &s;ecrecy. It is true, and there is no incon&s;i&s;tency in it. We had no &s;ecrets to go upon; our plan was perfectly con&s;titutional, and mu&s;t operate for the common good; but, at the &s;ame time, feeling our&s;elves under the arm of power; feeling our&s;elves to be militating again&s;t abu&s;e all powerful, it was prudent in us for the pre&s;ent not to expo&s;e our&s;elves more than nece&s;&s;ary: it was prudent to &s;ecure to our&s;elves a &s;afe place of meeting. He has &s;aid, it would be rebellion, and an overt act of trea&s;on. As to that I do not &s;ee how a &s;ecret meeting can be an overt act of trea&s;on. We &s;hould have been able to repair to the place of meeting &s;ecretly, becau&s;e we knew every &s;tretch of power would be made u&s;e of again&s;t us, and there is more rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that the pre&s;ent war with France is not directed &s;olely again&s;t France, but again&s;t the re|form in England. It was meant by that war to divert the atten|tion of the public from that cau&s;e, under the pretext of that an|cient prejudice, that that country was always our natural enemy; the numerous failures that are daily taking place; the numerous lo&s;&s;es that we have experienced, both, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, both by &s;ea and land, teach us that that war is far from being a profi|table one; teach us, that we are farther off gaining our end now, than we were at the beginning of that war; for we are at this day le&s;s able to treat, or to treat on &s;uch advantageous terms with that nation we have &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed as we were at the be|ginning of the war. Ruin &s;tares us in the face in every part of the kingdom; every manufacturing town is labouring under the greate&s;t mi&s;ery. London &s;hews no le&s;s than 8000 Spitalfields manufacturers who are &s;tarving. Norwich, another great trad|ing town (from which I have appeared in the Convention as a Delegate) is in &s;o di&s;mal a &s;ituation, that the poor rates, which were at fir&s;t, two years ago I think, or 18 months ago, but 3<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> in the pound, now amount to the enormous &s;um of 17<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR>; and, by Lady-day next, they will be 20<ABBR>s.</ABBR> in the pound, owing to the pre&s;ent war.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I hope you will not think it impertinent in me to follow the example that has been &s;et me, of reading from a new&s;|paper. It is not altogether &s;o plea&s;ing a fact to me, as that which the Pro&s;ecutor &s;tated from the Gazetteer was to him. It gave him &s;atisfaction that it criminated me&mdash;it gives me pain that I am obliged to criminate tho&s;e that are in office. I will read to you a letter from a clergyman who vi&s;ited the Spitalfields' weav|ers, and made a report of that vi&s;it. You will by this &s;ee part of

<P>Gentlemen, I will al&s;o read you a paragraph uncontradicted by authority, from the Morning Chronicle, of 1&s;t January, 1793. The Editor &s;ays,&mdash;"In one &s;hort month (December 1792)"&mdash; (<HI>See Appendix, No.</HI> 2.)</P>
<P>What is that but &s;aying that our con&s;titution is greatly im|paired within the&s;e twelve months, if we do not look to it, we &s;hall have nothing but an Italian or a Spani&s;h con&s;titution left to us. How therefore are we to re&s;tore that con&s;titution but by a timely reform! and how are we to obtain that reform, but by pur&s;uing it with vigour? and how are we to pur&s;ue it, if we are not to meet, and if an Engli&s;h Jury will permit to public pro&s;e|cutor (and believe every word he &s;ays) to throw an odium upon them; and &s;ay, that though their meaning may be good now, it may in future be bad; and therefore you mu&s;t condemn them as &s;editious. As a further proof, however, of the con&s;tituti|onality of the&s;e meetings, and the right we have to revert to our original con&s;titution, and to do away the exi&s;ting defects of that which is termed the pre&s;ent con&s;titution; I will read to you a letter from Lord Bathur&s;t to Dean Swift; although in his time the hou&s;e of Commons was corrupt; &s;ince that time no great effort has been made to amend it; and we all know that human in&s;titutions, however good they may be in their fir&s;t &s;et|ting out, go naturally to decay, unle&s;s repaired. It has more|over been a&s;&s;erted, that one of the glories of our con&s;titution is, that it is of &s;uch a nature, that it will admit of repair without being thrown out of order, and will always be advantaged by it; and that repair mu&s;t come from the people; but hear what Lord Bathur&s;t &s;ays: <Q>I am convinced that our con&s;titution is already gone:" luckily for the public pro&s;ecutor he has found it to|night, "and we are idly &s;truggling to maintain what in truth has been long lo&s;t; like &s;ome old fools here, with gout and pal&s;ies, at four&s;core years old drinking the waters," he was then at Bath, "in hopes of health again. If this was not our ca&s;e, and that the people are already in effect &s;laves, would it have been po&s;&s;ible for the mini&s;ter, who projected the exci&s;e &s;cheme (before the heats which it had occa&s;ioned in the na|tion were well laid) to have cho&s;en a new parliament again exactly to his mind? and though perhaps not altogether &s;o &s;trong in numbers, yet as well di&s;po&s;ed in general to his pur|po&s;es as he could wi&s;h.

man was;</Q> whether that applies to the pre&s;ent time or not, I leave the people of England and Scotland to di&s;cover, <Q>and yet I &s;ay a new parliament was cho&s;en of the &s;tamp that was de|&s;ired, after having failed in the mo&s;t odious &s;cheme that ever was projected. After this, what hopes can there po&s;&s;ibly be of &s;ucce&s;s? Unle&s;s it be from confu&s;ion, which God forbid I &s;hould live to &s;ee. In &s;hort, the whole nation is &s;o abandoned and corrupt, that the Crown can never fail of a majority in both hou&s;es of parliament. He makes them all in one hou&s;e, and he choo&s;es above half in the other, four and twenty bi|&s;hops," very upright men, "and &s;ixteen Scotch Lords is a terrible weight in one; forty-five from one country, be&s;ides all the We&s;t of England, and all the government boroughs, is a dreadful number in the other. Were his maje&s;ty inclined to-morrow to declare his body coachman his fir&s;t mini&s;ter, it would do ju&s;t as well, and the wheels of government would move as ea&s;ily as they do with the &s;agacious driver, who now &s;its on the box. Parts and abilities are not in the lea&s;t want|ing to conduct affairs: the coachman knows how to feed his cattle, and the other feeds the bea&s;ts in his &s;ervice; and this is all the &s;kill that is nece&s;&s;ary in either ca&s;e.

Gentlemen, &s;ince the days of Lord Bathur&s;t the di&s;orders of the &s;tate have gone on encrea&s;ing, and we are now loaded with &s;uch an immen&s;e debt, that it is incomprehen&s;ible how the nation &s;upports it&s;elf under it; and there are now forty millions more to add to it, for the &s;ake of preventing a reform in parlia|ment. A foreign war was entered into with that view, while the Crown Lawyers have been bu&s;y at home: words have been raked up of as far date back as a twelve month; &s;pies &s;et in pri|vate families; &s;ervants interrogated; the man has been &s;et again&s;t his ma&s;ter, and the child again&s;t its parent. Every art has been u&s;ed to bring forth criminal pro&s;ecutions, in order that reform may be di&s;couraged in every &s;hape; and that tho&s;e, who had been the foremo&s;t in attempting any thing like reform, &s;hould be &s;tigmati&s;ed as &s;editious,&mdash;trea&s;onable,&mdash;as ring leaders. &mdash;The&s;e words you have vociferated again and again, until they mu&s;t have tired your patience.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, here is a &s;tatement of the national debt, which perfectly applies to the ca&s;e in point. The national debt began with our happy revolution, which we are all bound to prai&s;e; and would to God the con&s;titution was as &s;ound now as it was then. The national debt was a &s;cheme devi&s;ed by William and

Mary, to &s;ecure their footing in England. At fir&s;t it amounted, I believe, to &s;even millions; but during that reign it increa&s;ed to &s;ixteen millions, and the wars of Queen Anne increa&s;ed it to fifty-four millions&mdash;the amount of the debt at the end of the war of 1748 was 78,250,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR>; the amount of the debt at the com|mencement of the war in 1775 was &s;eventy-five millions; after that there was a diminution took place of about four millions, which were paid off. At the end of Lord Chatham's war, the national debt amounted to one hundred and forty-&s;ix millions; it dimini&s;hed by the peace to one hundred and thirty-&s;ix millions, &s;o that a peace which la&s;ted till 1775 dimini&s;hed it ten millions, and in the war from 1775 to 1783, the infamous American war, where you will recollect the Americans were fir&s;t treated as re|bels, exactly in the &s;ame manner that the French are now treat|ed; they were deemed rebels; they were deemed a &s;et of vil|lains; they were deemed the wor&s;t creatures upon the face of the earth; and whenever they were &s;poken of, it was one Hand|cock, one Adams, one this, one that, and one the other, till we found, at the end of ten years war, and an expence of one hun|dred and thirty-four millions, be&s;ides one hundred thou&s;and lives lo&s;t in the war: we were obliged to give up the war, and accept of an Amba&s;&s;ador from them: and, at the time of Mr. Pitt's acce&s;&s;ion to the trea&s;ury bench it amounted to two hundred and &s;eventy millions. At this pre&s;ent day it is upwards of three hundred millions; and if we go on thus, year after year, we &s;hall &s;oon make it four hundred millions. But the remarks in this paper are more appo&s;ite.</P>
<P><Q>So immen&s;e a debt as two hundred and &s;eventy millions, bearing an intere&s;t of about nine millions and a half, was an alarming circum&s;tance to the public, after the lo&s;s of half the Briti&s;h dominions abroad; and &s;omething mu&s;t be done to divert the attention of the people from any &s;erious enquiry into the corruption and abu&s;es which had involved the nation in &s;uch ruin.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Mr. Fox was for probing this ulcerated wound to the bottom, and meting our &s;ituation in an open and manly manner, but the <HI>&s;ecret junto</HI> in the Cabinet,</Q>&mdash;and that junto, Gentlemen of the Jury, I will tell you originated in Scotland. I know not at pre&s;ent whether it continues its root there or not; I am much inclined to think it does; but the &s;ecret junto&mdash;<Q>fore&s;aw, that &s;uch a mea&s;ure would lead to impeachments, refunding and confi&s;cation of property. He was therefore turned out of of|fice, and Mr. Pitt &s;educed from his friends and party to become the tool of tho&s;e who began to be alarmed for fear an inve&s;tigation &s;hould take place.</Q> Here then Mr. Pitt is only the o&s;ten&s;ible mini&s;ter, while in fact he is ruled by a &s;ecret junto. <Q>A bubble was invented to amu&s;e the people, and &s;top the mouths of the monied men, the weake&s;t that ever was formed, and the mo&s;t ruinous and wicked one

that ever &s;ucceeded. The under&s;trappers in office,</Q> in Eng|land, gentlemen, we have under&s;trappers in office as well as in Scotland, <Q>and trea&s;ury runners, were ince&s;&s;antly employed in blacking Mr. Fox, and circulating in every company, that Mr. Pitt was to pay off the National Debt. The mea&s;ures he a|dopted for that purpo&s;e were cried up as a ma&s;ter piece of wi&s;dom: and this was again rung in the ears of the credu|lous people in every corner of the kingdom by the pro&s;tituted prints in the Mini&s;ter's pay. By &s;uch means, this extraordi|nary-bubble was blown up to an enormous &s;ize, and the trou|bles in Holland and France, as long as we kept in peace with the la&s;t mentioned nation, were favourable to the&s;e mea&s;ures. The prodigious demand for our manufactures, the increa&s;e of trade.</Q></P>
<P>I was in France, gentlemen, between three and four years ago upon a mercantile expedition. I had an opportunity of viewing all the great warehou&s;es in France, from the northernmo&s;t extre|mity to that very &s;outhernmo&s;t point of Toulon, which we have lately abandoned; and I will tell you, that in one &s;mall town not &s;o large as Leith, there was at that time Engli&s;h goods be|&s;poke, and in a great mea&s;ure paid for, to the amount of three millions &s;terling; that kept our manufactures afloat, that gave pro&s;perity to the Nation, and that was in con&s;equence of the commercial Treaty which was entered into between the two countries about five years back, and in which I am not a&s;hamed to &s;ay that I lent my humble a&s;&s;i&s;tance, not officially to the Mi|ni&s;ter here, but unofficially to the Mini&s;ter in France, becau&s;e I knew the commercial connection of two nations was the way to enrich both, and becau&s;e I knew that to do away that idea, that they were natural enemies, and &s;hould go to war upon every trivial occa&s;ion, was the only way to keep us in peace and pre|vent the &s;hedding of blood, which I am always &s;orry for in any ca&s;e whatever. I wi&s;h I could &s;ay &s;o of our Governors, <Q>the influx of money from France, Holland, and the convul&s;ed parts of Europe, gave Mini&s;ters an opportunity of levying enormous new taxes, even in time of peace,</Q> while we were pretending to pay off the National Debt, every year brought us new taxes; why? becau&s;e a majority in the Hou&s;e of Commons was to be &s;ecured. <Q>Mr. Pitt took every advantage that all tho&s;e favourable opportunities gave him, and loaded the Peo|ple with &s;uch heavy, partial, and grievous taxes, as no Mini&s;|ter ever before attempted, even in times of war.</Q> I doubt not, people of Scotland, but you labour under grievous taxes, as well as we in England; there is one I will give you an idea of, the Salt Tax, which &s;lies in the face of common &s;en&s;e; but it is kept up for a rea&s;on which I will tell you by and bye; the col|lection annually amounts from 19 to 20,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> but the expence of collecting it amounts to 30,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> People who are unthinking may &s;ay, why does not the Mini&s;ter &s;ell it when he lo&s;es &s;o much

by it; it gives the Mini&s;try at the trifling expence of 11,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per annum,</HI> it gives them a patronage of 30,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> <Q>Mr. Pitt's Shop Tax, Fu&s;tian Tax, his Tax on the Poor Servant Maids, the exten&s;ion of Exci&s;e Laws, his Commutation Tax, and others equally obnoxious, are witne&s;&s;es of the truth of what I now advance; with all his low cunning, artifice, exertions, &s;pies, informers.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, the Convention is reproached with adopting French words and French manners; it is now about &s;ix years ago that the Commercial Treaty was, I mu&s;t not &s;ay on the <HI>tapis,</HI> but was pending in the ca&s;e I mentioned before, in which my humble efforts were u&s;ed; I had acce&s;s to &s;ome of the dependents of the French Mini&s;try, and I there found that in Pitt's cabinet there was a &s;y&s;tem of Police; I made u&s;e of that word, which is adopted in Ireland, in a great mea&s;ure in London, and very like|ly will be &s;oon introduced into Scotland, if not already; the French Police, Pitt applied to Bretagne, and from them obtained every article of the French Police, Spies, and Informers and every thing except the Ba&s;tile; they had but one, and they could not &s;pare that one: however we have made &s;hift without it, having converted Newgate, and the Counter, and other pri&s;ons to that purpo&s;e, until a proper one &s;hall be built; there is one building in the neighbourhood of London, and I think I have &s;een &s;ome|thing like one building in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh; he has imported Spies and Informers, who have exerted them|&s;elves, and every one of them has been well paid for it; Spies and Informers, French things as well as French words. And I believe the Nation, at that time, though much degenerated, I have rea&s;on to believe, that at the fir&s;t out&s;et of Spies and Infor|mers, the Police of England were at a lo&s;s to find Engli&s;hmen willing to undertake tho&s;e odious ta&s;ks; &s;orry I am to &s;ay, that that repugnance is now nearly done away, that there is not a public company without a Spy in it, and even the &s;ervants of the Crown glory in their having Spies; &s;ome are more diligent than others; I &s;aw one here to-night, who, though he keeps &s;ix Spies daily, it is no uncommon thing for them to regret, at the end of the week, that they have brought him no intelligence; backed with the mo&s;t exten&s;ive commerce ever known, our manufac|tures and internal trade, pu&s;hed by indu&s;try, private credit, and paper currency, to a pitch never before heard of; and, in &s;hort, the whole credit of the merchants, traders, and manufacturers, exerted to the utmo&s;t, to keep every hand u&s;efully employed, was not &s;ufficient to rai&s;e taxes to pay the intere&s;t of &s;o immen&s;e a &s;um as two hundred and &s;eventy Millions of National Debt, defray the expences of Government, which, together with the intere&s;t, amounted to the enormous &s;um of about &s;eventeen Millions in time of Peace, without reckoning the Millions to be annually provided to &s;upport this bubble; all this, notwith&s;tand|ing the flouri&s;hing &s;tate which peace and the unexampled in|du&s;try
<PB N="118" REF="027594_0118_0FD54DE991A12B18">
of the people to revive our trade and commerce, could not be annually drawn from their labours, nor rai&s;ed by any of the oppre&s;&s;ive means adopted, without borrowing new loans; on one hand, as &s;tock was purcha&s;ed with the public money, on the other, that is to &s;ay, in paying the National Debt, you took the money out of one pocket, and paid it into the other; but while you did that, &s;ome of it always fell to the ground, which you never will &s;ee again: that money is employed in keeping up the price of Stocks; &s;ome thou&s;ands go weekly that way; a Re|form in Parliament would do away that abu&s;e. <Q>The Bank, that &s;acred, public, and private repo&s;itory for wealth, was &s;queezed out of half a Million. This drew on them creditors for the unclaimed dividends to a much larger amount, and o|ther means, equally unju&s;t, were pur&s;ued to &s;upply the defici|ency. But all this would not do; the bubble mu&s;t &s;ooner or later bur&s;t, and with a dreadful explo&s;ion, unle&s;s &s;peedily pre|vented by a more &s;kilful financier than Mr. Pitt.</Q> This bub|ble does not only threaten this Empire with the mo&s;t terrible convul&s;ions, but to &s;pread mi&s;chief into other countries. We have been told, that the Bank of Am&s;terdam is intimately con|nected with our own; if that fails, ours will, and that was gi|ven as the rea&s;on for our going to war; and very likely our go|ing to war, will be a rea&s;on for our Bank failing: <Q>it is form|ed on &s;uch ruinous principles, that it is impo&s;&s;ible all the ener|gy and indu&s;try of a brave, hardy, and loyal people, when &s;trained to the utmo&s;t pitch, can &s;upport it; it was &s;etting the Public to roll a heavy &s;tone up a &s;teep mountain, which grows &s;teeper and &s;teeper as the &s;ummit is approached. To attempt to pay off the National Debt by purcha&s;ing Stock, is one of the mo&s;t barefaced robberies.</Q> Here is language! this in Edinburgh would be Sedition; it would go near to be Trea&s;on &mdash;<Q>the attempt to pay off the National Debt by purcha&s;ing up Stock, is one of the mo&s;t barefaced robberies committed on the People, that ever was attempted in any civilized nation.</Q> Here you &s;ee Mr. Pitt is called a robber, and the mo&s;t barefaced and impudent robber that ever was, <Q>loading the People with unbearable Taxes, to enrich who? the Stockholders, the Mo|nied-men, and Gamblers, in the Alley; the&s;e were &s;ure to a&s;|&s;i&s;t the mini&s;terial runners in blowing up this bubble, which brought &s;o much gri&s;t to their mill; by their united arts and unwearied efforts, they actually rai&s;ed the price of Stock to &s;uch a pitch, as to make the Public pay more than 20<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;ter|ling more than the intrin&s;ic value, upon every 100<ABBR>l.</ABBR></Q> And as long as the indu&s;try of the People could bear &s;uch burdens as were heaped upon them, there is every rea&s;on to believe they would ri&s;e higher and higher; &s;o that the more the Public pur|cha&s;ed, the more they would have to pay for the remainder, pro|viding this bubble was &s;uffered to continue. Mr. Pitt, in&s;tead of paying off any part of the National Debt, in time of peace,
<PB N="119" REF="027594_0119_0FDC053F063CE0C8">
by his plan, had added many Millions; and if we are to go on in this ruinous plan, the increa&s;ed price of the &s;tock will lead us with more than 150 Millions more than was ever owed or pre|tended to have been borrowed.</P>
<P>There, Gentlemen, in con&s;equence of this &s;y&s;tem, the Nation will find it&s;elf debtor 150 Millions more than ever was pretended had been lent to it; an immen&s;e &s;um of it&s;elf, but which the Nation would have been barefacedly robbed of&mdash;150 Million &s;terling which we never borrowed. <Q>It will ea&s;ily be &s;een, by examining the Hi&s;tory of the Revenue, or this brief &s;tatement, that every war which this Country has been engaged in has nearly doubled the former Debt and Taxes, let them amount to what they might; and yet the Nation has been plunged into a war, with this heavy mill&s;tone of two hundred and &s;e|venty Millions about its neck. The effect of this ra&s;h mea|&s;ure has been &s;uddenly and &s;everely felt; almo&s;t a total &s;tag|nation in trade and commerce, the Revenue decrea&s;ing in the mo&s;t alarming manner, all private credit de&s;troyed:</Q> the neighbourhood of Edinburgh will witne&s;s that: look at Pai&s;ley, look at Gla&s;gow, and their Banks, even which will all con|vince you that there is truth in this a&s;&s;ertion; <Q>no one dare tru&s;t his neighbour, bankruptcies innumerable, the indu&s;trious poor thrown out of employment.</Q> Do we not &s;ee that even in Edinburgh, the poor are ready and willing to work if they could get it? Are they not the &s;ame at Pai&s;ley? are they not the &s;ame at Gla&s;gow? I have already in&s;tanced to you in Eng|land; Norwich, Sheffield, and Manche&s;ter, where the poor are out of number; but here is an addition, <Q>provi&s;ions, and even hay, &s;ent out of the kingdom, to &s;upply the German armies,</Q> not to &s;upply our own troops, but for&s;ooth, we mu&s;t take other troops into pay, while our poor are &s;tarving at home in con&s;e|quence of it, <Q>which keeps up the price of meat to a height never remembered at this &s;ea&s;on of the year; coals, candles, &s;oap, &s;ugar, and many other articles in common u&s;e, are rai&s;|ed or kept up, in con&s;equence of the war.</Q></P>
<P>Here is an article to which I would turn your attention, the article of coals, the City of London yearly, con&s;umes about forty-thou&s;and chaldron of coals; every chaldron of coals pays one &s;hilling, to whom? To a man who did not think pro|per, when cited by the laws of his Country, to appear before you; and pays it to him, why? Becau&s;e he is the de&s;cendant of a natural &s;on of Charles II. If he had been a poor man, and it had been nece&s;&s;ary to keep up an appearance of re&s;pectability in his &s;tation; there would have been &s;ome excu&s;e; but he has another &s;inecure which amounts to more than he &s;pends; this is one of the abu&s;es of a corrupt Parliament.&mdash;Our money &s;hipped off to pay the troops, and &s;upply the beggarly German Princes on the Continent. The parochial taxes prodigiou&s;ly increa&s;ed, by the numerous poor thrown out of employment; or borne
<PB N="120" REF="027594_0120_0FD54DEC26D7D130">
down by the heavy load of taxes Mr. Pitt has thrown upon them; and threatened, notwith&s;tanding all that is &s;aid to the contrary, with the ruin of another American war. In &s;uch a &s;tate, is it po&s;&s;ible to expect that the public can bear to double the pre&s;ent National Debt and Taxes, without bur&s;ting Mr. Pitt's bubble, formed for plundering the poor to add to the rich. This man &s;peaks very plain Engli&s;h, and I am &s;orry to &s;ay, he &s;peaks as truly, as he does plainly; it has been a decided plan with tho&s;e in power, to plunder the poor to give to the rich; and will con|tinue &s;o, while u&s;ele&s;s places, while u&s;ele&s;s pen&s;ions, are &s;uffered to exi&s;t, while a Lord Ju&s;tice General of Scotland, who never attends his place, though ju&s;tice is the mo&s;t &s;acred duty a man can acquit him&s;elf of; the duty of a Judge is the mo&s;t &s;acred duty that a man can undertake, &s;ince it is the repre&s;entive of God him&s;elf: that he &s;hould accept of 2000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year and never attend in his place, to di&s;tribute that ju&s;tice for which he is &s;o amply paid; that is another proof of &s;inecure places, and a proof that we want a Reform in Parliament; you have now been a hundred years, except one in&s;tance, without the appearance of a Lord Ju&s;tice General; 200,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> therefore has been carried out of Scotland and &s;pent in England; therefore you annually lo&s;e 2000<ABBR>l,</ABBR> for which you derive no advantage whatever. <Q>The cri&s;is draws near, when every inferior con&s;ideration mu&s;t give way for public good, and Mr. Fox's open and manly abi|lities mu&s;t be called forth, to form an hone&s;t, ju&s;t, permanent, and upright Mini&s;try, to &s;ave the King and People from one common ruin.</Q></P>
<P>I did not read this to you, Gentlemen, with a view to trumpet up Mr. Fox: no man can have a greater re&s;pect for his abilities than I have, but I am far from thinking that no man in the king|dom can &s;ave us but him; I would not make any man a God; let us not tru&s;t them; let us not give them implicit faith; let us tru&s;t to none of our rulers; let us tru&s;t only to our Laws; and while we give implicit faith to them, and &s;ee that our rulers act according to tho&s;e laws, we &s;hall be happy: the moment we do otherwi&s;e, we &s;hall be &s;laves. <Q>Apo&s;tates have rai&s;ed fal&s;e alarms of trea&s;on, &s;edition, rebellion, and every thing that can rou&s;e up a generous People, to revenge the in&s;ults and in|juries heaped upon them; but the People are loyal, love their King, re&s;pect mild laws, and bear an utter hatred to all who attempt to impo&s;e upon them, by apo&s;tacy, fraud, or treach|ery, and are &s;worn enemies to all &s;orts of per&s;ecutions.</Q> Would not you think that the writer of this letter had &s;ome of the per&s;ecutions which have lately taken place, in his eye? You will &s;ee then, Gentlemen, that it is not merely in Scotland alone &mdash;that the People in Scotland are not the only People who &s;ee their true intere&s;ts; that the People of England, likewi&s;e, begin to di&s;cern that they are impo&s;ed upon, that tho&s;e who are in of|fice deceive them: open your eyes, therefore, Gentlemen, and
<PB N="121" REF="027594_0121_0FD54DEE81F290D0">
be not deceived; let not the words of office, let not the high &s;ounding language of a Crown Lawyer trepan you into a per|jury, for if you &s;uffer your&s;elves to be deceived, though not a wilful perjury, it &s;till remains a perjury, unle&s;s you give a ver|dict according to the dictates of your own con&s;cience; and the dictates of that con&s;cience cannot take place, till you have made a fair and candid examination of the matter before you.</P>
<P>His po&s;tcript &s;ays, <Q>Two hundred and &s;eventy Million is a &s;um the human mind can hardly form an idea of: to give &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance in forming a notion of it, were it to be laid down in guineas in a line, it would extend 4300 miles: if in &s;hillings, it would extend three and a half times round the globe; and if paid in &s;olid &s;ilver, would require more than 60,000 hor&s;es to draw it, at the rate of 1,500 weight to a hor&s;e;</Q> and yet the good people of this country are, by their labours, to pay off the intere&s;t of this debt, and are with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of Pitt's calculations, to pay off the capital al&s;o. The number of inhabitants of Great Britain has been mi&s;tated, as well as many other things, by the public pro&s;ecutor; he has &s;tated them to be ten millions; they perhaps, do not go much beyond &s;even millions; but we will &s;ay eight millions, and among them you cannot &s;ay there are more than two million of men: and, therefore two million of people are to pay the intere&s;t of this debt, which, if laid out in guineas, in a line, would extend upwards of 4,300 miles. Good God! when &s;hall we get to end of &s;uch a journey; and yet we are daily encrea&s;ing in it by a war; and, what is the con&s;equence of that war? not only ex|pences abroad, but it encrea&s;es &s;alaries and pen&s;ions: we bought: Toulon with gold; we left it for nothing: it is true, we adopted again the French mea&s;ures; we named Commi&s;&s;ioners: one Commi&s;&s;ioner &s;et out, with a &s;ervice of plate, to do honour to the name of an Engli&s;hman, which co&s;t 8,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and yet there are 8000 Spitalfields weavers in a &s;tate, of actual &s;tarvation; and yet, to one man, is pre&s;ented a &s;ervice of plate, of that immen&s;e value, previous to his going as Commi&s;&s;ioner to Toulon: he comes back again, and is now out of office, but has retired upon half pay: this is the way the public money is &s;quandered; this is the way the public money will be &s;quandered till we obtain a Reform in Parliament; therefore, no man, not the public pro|&s;ecutor him&s;elf, can love the Con&s;titution better than I do; but no man can dete&s;t the abu&s;es that are engrafted on that con&s;titu|tion more than I do; for, I have &s;een &s;o much mi&s;ery, in the cour&s;e of my tours through Great Britain, which is the garden of Europe, where there is not a man, who would exert his in|du&s;try, but might earn a comfortable livelihood, if our Con&s;titu|tion was returned to that point at which it was &s;ettled at the Re|volution; but it is all done away; I will give you proof that it is done away; and I have taken care to give you that proof, or, at lea&s;t that each of you may be furni&s;hed with a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of it when

<P> Gentlemen, you are entru&s;ted now by your country, to give a verdict, to examine &s;eriou&s;ly the cau&s;e that is now before you. I have already told you, I am a willing and a devoted victim; I will give you a proof of it; and you &s;hall have that proof home with you, in a letter, that I wrote to Dundas, a twelvemonth ago, when pro&s;ecutions were hanging over the heads of the people: I offered my&s;elf for pro&s;ecution; I de&s;ired him to &s;pare them, and let his vengeance fall upon me: I e&s;caped it in London; I hope I &s;hall not find it in Scotland; I hope the hone&s;ty of any Jury will prevent its having the effect it was meant to have. This is the &s;peech of Mr. Wharton, in the Hou&s;e of Commons. Mr. Wharton ro&s;e to make his propo&s;ed motion. "We heard," he &s;aid, <Q>on every &s;ide, of the glorious Revo|lution, in 1668, and of the Con&s;titution, as &s;ettled at the glo|rious Revolution; it was a note which he had always li&s;tened to with plea&s;ure, and he repeated it him&s;elf with rapture. But, what was the rational foundation of our &s;atisfaction, at the recollection of the glorious Revolution? It a&s;&s;uredly was not that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne, and the regular hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to it, were, at that time di&s;turbed and interrupted. It was not that we expelled <HI>one</HI> king, and <HI>one</HI> family, and appointed <HI>another</HI> king, and <HI>another</HI> family, in their room.

that they not only <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> re&s;i&s;tance, but made it <HI>merito|rious.</HI></Q> And yet, this is one of the articles of crimination a|gain&s;t me.

But an ap|probation of that Revolution went &s;till farther.

It declared, that if, by <HI>any</HI> means, by force, or by fraud, by violence, or by corruption, if the&s;e whole&s;ome and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;titutional provi&s;ions &s;hould, by any means, be taken away, or fru&s;trated, the &s;ame objects would again ju&s;tify the &s;ame national &s;trug|gle; and, the &s;ame extremities, unle&s;s they could be recov|ered, and, re-obtained by more gentle, more peaceful, and, therefore, more happy means.</Q> We at pre&s;ent feel, that force or fraud violence and corruption, have taken away many of our privileges: we wi&s;h to regain them; not by force, but by tho&s;e more peaceful, and, therefore, more happy means, which is a peaceable and rational application to the King, or to the Parliament, by an a&s;&s;ertion of our rights, made in &s;uch a re&s;pec|table manner, that they &s;hall not be refu&s;ed; for, it is idle to talk of the omnipotence of Parliament; the &s;ervant can never be greater than its ma&s;ter; the three E&s;tates together, are not equal in value to the whole nation: without them, the nation could be a nation; but, without the nation they would become poor indi|viduals. He a&s;&s;erted (and &s;aid he ri&s;ked nothing by the a&s;&s;ertion, <Q>for no man could be hardy enough to deny it, and, he pledged him&s;elf to <HI>prove</HI> it in a Committee of the Hou&s;e), that all that was valuable to the people of this country, all the provi&s;ions which were &s;tipulated to &s;ecure the peace and pro&s;perity, the individual liberty, and the general property of the people of this land, had, all been, &s;ince the Revolution, taken away&mdash; All!</Q></P>

what this country e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Revolution. Fir&s;t, To avoid all future mi&s;takes; and, that the contract between Prince and People might be clearly under&s;tood, the Revolu|tioni&s;ts began by altering the oaths of the contracting parties.</Q> Here again I will interrupt my&s;elf, to &s;hew you that the King holds his Crown, not by a divine right, but by a contract between him and the people, which implies a mutual binding; and, &s;hould either of the contracting parties fail, it will become void: Men in bu&s;ine&s;s, you mu&s;t know it; and, from bu&s;ine&s;s to poli|tics, is a very ea&s;y tran&s;ition; the principle is the &s;ame. <Q>They altered the Coronation oath for all future Sovereigns in this realm; and they altered the oath of allegiance for them&s;elves, and for all future &s;ubjects. They cut up, by the roots, the damnable doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance:</Q> doctrines &s;edulou&s;ly endeavoured to be inculcated into you to|night; that non-re&s;i&s;tance and pa&s;&s;ive obedience, though couch|ed in other words, were the duty of the &s;ubject. I &s;ay it is no &s;uch thing; and here is an hone&s;t man declaring this in Parliament, and nobody de&s;iring to confute him. He &s;ays, <Q>they cut up, by the roots, the damnable doctrine of <HI>pa&s;&s;ive obedience</HI> and <HI>non-re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> by <HI>emphatically</HI> &s;pecifying and ordaining the follow|ing words of their former oath, 1 William and Mary, ch. viii. I declare, that it is not lawful, upon any pretence whatever, to take up arms again&s;t the King, &amp;c. &amp;c. &s;hould not, from thenceforth, be required or enjoined.</Q> Therefore, you &s;ee, Gentlemen, that it is no longer required of the &s;ubject to take an oath; that he will not, in any circum&s;tance whatever, take up arms again&s;t the King; becau&s;e, as this King comes to the throne, not by divine right, but by a contract between the King and the people, it was thought, if he neglected his contract on the one part, the people were not bound by that contract on the other, and, he hereby e&s;tabli&s;hes the doctrine of re&s;i&s;tance to oppre&s;&s;ion: in fact, &s;elf-pre&s;ervation is the fir&s;t law of nature with an individual; and, what is the ca&s;e with an individual is much more &s;o with a &s;ociety. <Q>It was not &s;o much to relieve the con&s;cience of the &s;ubjects, that the&s;e words of their for|mer oath were &s;elected, recited, and aboli&s;hed; for no oath of &s;lavery ever did, or ever will, or ever ought to bind a nation, or an individual; it was &s;omething wor&s;e than perjury, or &s;acrilege, to keep an oath of &s;lavery.</Q> Here is the true &s;pirit of freedom, breathing in the&s;e words: it was &s;omething wor&s;e than perjury, or &s;acrilege, to keep an oath of &s;lavery. No; man was not born to &s;lavery. <Q>This alteration was made to prevent the future Sovereigns of this country from being mi&s;&s;ed, as the four preceding Sovereigns had been, to tru&s;t to a &s;en&s;ele&s;s &s;uper&s;tition about <HI>Royalty,</HI> which though many per&s;ons for their intere&s;ts have profe&s;&s;ed, no man of common &s;en&s;e ever entertained.</Q> Many of the&s;e doctrines are profe&s;&s;ed at this day: men profe&s;s doctrines very different from what their hearts

feel; but while blinding the eyes of the Public, they are the mo&s;t con&s;cientious men living. <Q>Their next care was to pro|vide for the due admini&s;tration of the Executive Power, and the re&s;pon&s;ibility of its confidential advi&s;ers. They therefore enacted, 12th William III. chap. ii. that all matters and things relating to the well-governing of this kingdom which are cognizable in the Privy Council, by the Laws and Cu&s;toms of this Realm, <HI>&s;hall be tran&s;acted there,</HI> and all Re&s;olutions taken thereupon <HI>&s;hall be &s;igned</HI> by &s;uch of the Privy Council as &s;hall advi&s;e and con&s;ent to the &s;ame.</Q> Here you &s;ee, Gentle|men, that the government of a large country, like Great Bri|tain, is of &s;o public a nature as not to admit of &s;ecrets; it is of &s;uch a nature that a re&s;pon&s;ibility mu&s;t be affixed &s;omewhere, and therefore tho&s;e per&s;ons who adopted mea&s;ures in the Privy Council were to &s;ign the &s;ame, in order that the public might know where the blame or the prai&s;e lay; this has been done away, and you have heard to-night, when a que&s;tion was put relative to orders, tho&s;e orders were deemed proper to be kept a &s;ecret; thus we imitate the practices of tho&s;e in higher &s;ta|tions, and inferiors will naturally catch at the defects &s;ooner than at the beauties of their ma&s;ters' behaviour. <Q>Thereby guarding, as far as Laws could guard, again&s;t that accur&s;ed engine of de&s;poti&s;m, <HI>a Cabinet Council,</HI></Q> which the paper I ju&s;t now read, calls a Secret Junto, <Q>or that more accur&s;ed in|&s;trument, an Interior Cabinet,</Q> from which we have not been free for 25 years.</P>
<P><Q>Their attention was next directed to the <HI>double</HI> repre&s;enta|tion of the People, the only po&s;&s;ible &s;ecurity for all their other provi&s;ions.</Q> There is undoubtedly no provi&s;ion, no &s;ecurity, for the liberty, for the property of the Subject, if he is not properly repre&s;ented in Parliament: we are too numer|ous to make Laws for our&s;elves; we mu&s;t therefore be repre|&s;ented; we mu&s;t &s;end Delegates or Commi&s;&s;ioners to a Parlia|ment, where a convenient number of them may meet and tran&s;|act the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Nation; if that bu&s;ine&s;s is not done faith|fully; if the men &s;ent to do that bu&s;ine&s;s are liable to be bought and &s;old, we &s;hall in our turns pay both Purcha&s;er and Purcha&s;ed &mdash;"The Hou&s;e of Commons and Juries." This is the double repre&s;entation in England; we were the only Nation who en|joyed it.</P>
<P>A neighbouring Nation, though much run down, have lately arrived at the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. Juries con&s;i&s;t of twelve or fifteen men, according to the country in which they act. They are not to &s;tand in fear of the Judge, or in fear of the King; for, if they act according to their con&s;cience, no Judge dare &s;ay any thing to an hone&s;t Jury; they have a double duty; the fir&s;t to God, and the next to their country; but they both of them form a moral duty, and are one and the &s;ame thing. Jurymen are ab&s;olute; they have a right to a&s;k que&s;tions, they have a

right, where the lea&s;t doubt hangs over the mind, to enquire of the Pannel; they have a right to enquire of the Coun&s;el, and they have a right to call forth all the wi&s;dom of the Judges; while in office they po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t unlimited power that we know of in England. He &s;ays, <Q>Our Ance&s;tors pa&s;&s;ed over un|touched, and left them as they found them the Nobility and the Church; they were con&s;idering the &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial parts of the Con&s;titutional Edifice, and did not much concern them&s;elves about the <HI>gilding</HI> and the <HI>varni&s;h.</HI> They there|fore proceeded to e&s;tabli&s;h the principle of a <HI>fair</HI> and <HI>free</HI> and <HI>frequent</HI> election of the Repre&s;entatives of the Commons in Par|liament, as might be &s;een by a reference to the acts pa&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t and &s;econd and third years of William and Mary.</Q> You &s;ee here, a term which at fir&s;t appears to be a kind of &s;neer or joke, but it is founded in truth, and leads you to a much deeper reflection. He &s;ays, <Q>Our Ance&s;tors did not much concern them&s;elves about the Gilding and the Varni&s;h,</Q> meaning the Nobility and the Church; and it is not merely a jeer or a play|ing upon words, but ari&s;es from the principle already laid down, that the Nation, and the Nation alone, is the principal part: it is the People that are of con&s;equence, and nothing but the Peo|ple. <Q>And having thus, as they imagined, provided for the <HI>real</HI> election of the Repre&s;entative body in Parliament, they &s;ecured the independence and integrity of that body after its election, by enacting, that no Per&s;on who has an office or place of profit under the King, or receives a pen&s;ion from the Crown, &s;hall be capable of &s;erving as a Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons.</Q> Now, if this took place with regard to the Na|tional A&s;&s;embly, where Laws are only made; undoubtedly a &s;i|milar re&s;triction was under&s;tood to be in full force in that A&s;|&s;embly, where the Laws are carried into execution, I mean in Juries; for if men enjoying places of profit under the Crown are deemed incapable of making Laws, they &s;hould by a much &s;tronger rea&s;on be deemed incapable of carrying them into exe|cution, e&s;pecially when there is no appeal from their Verdict; or at lea&s;t, an appeal attended with &s;uch difficulties and &s;uch ex|pence, as to put it out of the power of nine tenths of tho&s;e who are tried to make u&s;e of the remedy. <Q>Having thus &s;ecured the purity and independence of the people's repre&s;entatives in Parliament, they proceeded to the other important branch of their repre&s;entation by Jury, and they decreed that Juries &s;hould be fairly taken without partiality, and &s;hould act free|ly without influence.</Q> Ob&s;erve that, Gentlemen; I don't im|pute it to the ca&s;e of to-day, but when I &s;ay it is po&s;&s;ible to pack a Jury, I can &s;hew my authority, when it has been a&s;&s;erted in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and has not been denied. <Q>They al&s;o decreed, that <HI>exce&s;&s;ive bail</HI> &s;hould not be required, that <HI>exce&s;|&s;ive fines</HI> &s;hould not be impo&s;ed, and that <HI>illegal</HI> and <HI>cruel</HI> puni&s;hments &s;hould not be inflicted; and to &s;ecure the&s;e ob|jects,
<PB N="127" REF="027594_0127_0FD54DF7C3271D18">
they ordained that thenceforward the Judges commi&s;|&s;ions &s;hould be made <HI>quamdiu &s;e bene ge&s;&s;erint;</HI> and that their &s;alaries &s;hould be a&s;certained and e&s;tabli&s;hed, in order to make the Judges independent of the Crown.</Q> The duty of a Judge is, not to influence you, not to &s;ay any thing that has the lea&s;t ten|dency to influence you; he is to explain the Law in any difficult point to you, but by no means to give you his opinion upon the ca&s;e; he is merely to &s;tate the Law, and &s;ay always, hypotheti|cally, if the man is guilty of the offence, &s;uch and &s;uch puni&s;h|ment is due to it; but he is never to &s;ay, let me beg of you to &s;ay &s;o and &s;o; it is illegal, it is the highe&s;t pitch of wickedne&s;s in a Judge &s;o to do. <Q>Now, all the&s;e provi&s;ions (the objects and con&s;equences of the glorious Revolution) would have no va|lue, they would be nugatory and worthle&s;s; they would be a mockery unle&s;s they were effectually to obtain and &s;ecure to the People of this Land the&s;e three important points, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> An hone&s;t and <HI>re&s;pon&s;ible</HI> exerci&s;e of the <HI>Executive</HI> Authority. <HI>Secondly, Real</HI> independent and faithful Repre&s;entatives of the Commons in Parliament. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> A fair and impartial admi|ni&s;tration of Ju&s;tice in the Courts of Law. We who had no predilection for <HI>any</HI> family whatever (except as connected with the&s;e objects) in the words of our Ance&s;tors at the time of the Revolution, did now again <HI>claim, demand,</HI> and <HI>in&s;i&s;t,</HI> upon all tho&s;e as our undoubted <HI>Rights,</HI> the <HI>true, ancient,</HI> and <HI>indubi|table</HI> rights and liberties of this kingdom, 1&s;t William and Mary, chap ii. If then by various means it had happened, as he a&s;&s;erted, and undertook to prove (in a Committee of this Hou&s;e,) that this provi&s;ional re&s;pon&s;ibility of the Privy Council no longer remains; that the election of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons is neither, <HI>fair,</HI> nor <HI>free,</HI> nor <HI>frequent;</HI> that this provi&s;ion|al independence of its Members is gone, and that the Hou&s;e, at pre&s;ent, <HI>&s;warms</HI> with Per&s;ons having offices and places of profit under the King, and receiving pen&s;ions from the Crown; that Juries are not fairly and impartially taken; that they do not act freely and without influence; that exce&s;&s;ive bail may be, and has been, required; that exce&s;&s;ive fines may be, and have been, impo&s;ed; that illegal and cruel puni&s;hments, may be, and have been, inflicted; that the Judges are not indepen|dent of the Crown; that pen&s;ions may, and have been, con|ferred, upon others, by which means it cannot be &s;aid that their &s;alaries are a&s;certained and e&s;tabli&s;hed.

provi&s;ions, that &s;o we might effectually &s;ecure to our&s;elves and to our po&s;terity, what our Ance&s;tors endeavoured at the Re|volution to &s;ecure to them&s;elves and to us.</Q> I hope that &s;in|gle pa&s;&s;age will be &s;ufficient to do away all the criminality of the word <HI>a&s;&s;ert,</HI> in the Indictment. It may be done in two ways, by force, or by argument; in either ca&s;e, it would be ju&s;tified by the pre&s;ent glorious Con&s;titution, taken not ironically; not in&s;idiou&s;ly, as it is taken by &s;ome, but literally, according to the truth. Our glorious con&s;titution permits us to a&s;&s;ert our rights, and even permits us to re&s;i&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion: however, from the ten|or of the proceedings of the Convention, you will &s;ee that arms were the la&s;t things we &s;hould have thought of; being little in|ured to arms, and being a &s;mall number to the bulk of the na|tion, I mean the a&s;&s;ociated men, who have &s;ent their Delegates to the Briti&s;h Convention; and from what has happened to-day, you will &s;ee that the public mind is panting for Reform; and I hope, Gentlemen, if your countenances deceive me not, that you all, or the greater part of you, wi&s;h for Reform; an amend|ment can be attended with no ill con&s;equences. Mr. Wharton concluded with moving, <Q>That a Committee be appointed to enquire whether any, and which of the provi&s;ions made by Parliament in the reign of William and Mary, and in the reign of William III. for &s;ecuring the re&s;pon&s;ible exerci&s;e of the Executive authority; for &s;ecuring a real, independent, and faithful repre&s;entation of the Commons in Parliament; and for &s;ecuring a fair and impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in the Courts of Law, whether any, and which, of the&s;e have by any means been invalidated or taken away; and to con&s;i|der whether any, and which, of tho&s;e lo&s;t or invalidated pro|vi&s;ions may be fit to be re-enacted and re&s;tored, in order that the people of this land may recover that &s;ituation and &s;ecurity in which they were placed by the glorious Revolution in 1688.</Q> This motion, I have already told you, was lo&s;t, and it was lo&s;t by a majority of 71 &s;ilent men, again&s;t 11 hone&s;t men who &s;upported it; but the 71 did not utter a &s;ingle &s;yllable, though I firmly believe the Lord Advocate was in the Hou&s;e at the time: if he was not there, his ma&s;ter, his father, his uncle were there, and not a word was &s;aid; they put it to the &s;ilent vote, and numbers carried it, which &s;hews you what chance we have of obtaining, by an humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive petition to the Hou&s;e of Commons, any redre&s;s; it &s;hews you, that if we want to ob|tain redre&s;s, we had much better go to the fountain of redre&s;s, and apply, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to the King; but that is a thing that is matter of opinion; however, it requires con&s;ideration; and when the matter of reform comes to be more public, which I hope it will, it will then bear ample di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have, I believe, in the former part of my de|fence, mentioned to you, that the Lord Advocate not being able to &s;ub&s;tantiate his charges again&s;t me upon written evidence,

was forced to draw in a more powerful aid; namely, a blank, as a proof of criminality; he has laid great &s;tre&s;s upon it; he has turned about in it like a hor&s;e in a mill, and though he went back from it once or twice in the cour&s;e of his &s;peech, he was &s;ure to return to it again. He has likewi&s;e &s;ought to attach a great degree of criminality to the words Convention of Emer|gency, which is a &s;imple Engli&s;h word, &s;ignifies a ca&s;e of great moment, a ca&s;e that requires &s;peed, that requires immediate at|tention, that requires all the exertions we can po&s;&s;ibly be&s;tow upon it; therefore &s;trip it of the epithete, &s;editious, malicious, felonious, and all the&s;e high &s;ounding words, and you find no|thing in it unju&s;tifiable whatever. He has al&s;o &s;ought to crimi|nate me, with charging that my friend Browne gave a hi&s;tory of the Habeas Corpus Act; and he has wi&s;hed to attach, more than &s;edition, a kind of trea&s;on, to the bare mention in the Con|vention of the wrongous impri&s;onment Act; &s;urely, if &s;uch an Act exi&s;ts, it is competent to every &s;ubject of the realm to &s;ee that it is &s;ecured to them; that it was (as I pre&s;ume all Acts are) made for the benefit of the Public, and therefore it is natural that men &s;hould be anxious that tho&s;e benefits &s;hould be retained to them; yet it &s;hould &s;eem that the bare mention of &s;uch a thing is Trea&s;on in Scotland. It galls tho&s;e in power, to think that they have got a power above them; that they are not en|tirely above control; but I have already &s;aid that there is not a man in the kingdom above control; even the King holds his Crown by a contract, and therefore is not above control; he is not above the Laws; he is not, indeed, re&s;pon&s;ible; the fiction of law &s;ays, he can do no wrong, becau&s;e his contract holds no longer than he abides by the Con&s;titution of the kingdom; the moment he would attempt, as a James, or a Charles I. to break the contract between him and the People, the moment he had broken that contract, he would then no longer be unaccountable to the People. On the contrary, it is mo&s;t likely, the People would call him to an account, as they have done in other ca&s;es before, when they have ventured to ride paramount over the Laws. The Laws are made for the weal of the Nation, and are of more importance than any individual, in whatever rank &s;oci|ety may have placed him; they are of more importance than any individual, for without Laws there is no Society; and with|out any individual whatever, the Society may &s;till remain a Society.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I will come now to the mere points of the Indict|ment; for the &s;peech of the Public Pro&s;ecutor has wandered greatly from the mere facts &s;tated in the Indictment: however, I was obliged to follow him, ina&s;much as he did me the honour on Monday la&s;t, of trying me before another Jury; for it was me more than Skirving that he tried; it was me he had con|tinually in his mouth; and, to me, that a great part of his &s;peech then applied.

By the regulations that I will read to you, you will &s;ee that we were far from having any &s;editious or di&s;orderly princi|ples about us; but that we were organizing our&s;elves into the mo&s;t regular body in the world, and, I believe, even Freema&s;ons them|&s;elves, who have regulations and &s;ecrets, and, I believe, &s;ome of their committees are pretty &s;ecret; meet together, and therefore are guilty of all the crimes I am charged with; and I don't know that there is &s;o much regularity even in their proceedings, as there was in our's. <Q>The Convention &s;hall henceforth be called, The Briti&s;h Convention of the Delegates of the Peo|ple, a&s;&s;ociated to obtain Univer&s;al Suffrage and Annual Par|liaments.

No, let us ou&s;t the abu&s;es, and re&s;tore the Con&s;titution to the &s;tate in which it was in 1688. <Q>The Secretary, and In|termediate Committee, may, at any time, call a Convention of the Delegates, on 14 days notice; but they &s;hall be re&s;pon&s;ible for a proper exerci&s;e of their authority. The Convention after electing a Pre&s;ident by &s;how of hands.</Q> Here we call him a Pre&s;ident; that is not a French word; I fancy that is a word that has been u&s;ed in England for the&s;e 50 years back, and I cannot attach any degree of criminality to it, becau&s;e we did not put it in the power of a man, to &s;ay he was &s;ent by a certain number of people, unle&s;s he was intru&s;ted with the confidence of tho&s;e men, for the purpo&s;e of a Parliamentary Reform, as I will &s;hew you by the in&s;tructions that I brought from London, which I have in my pocket, and which e&s;caped the Inqu&s;ition. <Q>The Convention, after electing a Pre&s;ident by &s;how of hands, &s;hall proceed to the verification of power, and then to the divi&s;ion of the Convention into Sections, in &s;uch manner as &s;hall here|after be provided.</Q> Here follows the head of Office Bearers.

The public pro&s;ecutor told you he could not tell what this Pre&s;es meant; this will explain it. <Q>There &s;hall be a Pre&s;ident or Pre&s;es, three A&s;&s;i&s;tants, a Secretary, a Trea&s;urer, and Door|keepers. The three A&s;&s;i&s;tants and the Secretary &s;hall form a Council, to be denominated the Council of the Table. The office of the Pre&s;es is to maintain order, to take the &s;en&s;e of the Convention on all que&s;tions to be determined therein, and to declare on which &s;ide the que&s;tion is carried, to call on the Committees for reports, &amp;c. and to &s;ign all Public Acts.</Q> You &s;ee there is nothing &s;editious in the office of Pre&s;es; unfortu|nately that night there was no Public Act pa&s;&s;ed; I kept order, or endeavoured to do it, as well as I could. I took the &s;en&s;e of the Convention, and declared on which &s;ide the que&s;tions were carried: an explanation of that you will &s;ee by and bye, under a &s;eparate head. <Q>The office of the Council of the table, is to keep order in the <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of the Convention, as particularly &s;pecified under the head Council. The office of the Secretary is to take charge of all writings and papers belonging to the Convention; to i&s;&s;ue &s;ummon&s;es, write and di&s;patch letters, &amp;c. &amp;c. according to the orders of the Convention, and the reque&s;t of any Committee, during the time of their &s;itting; and &s;hall have acce&s;s, on all occa&s;ions, to every Committee during its &s;itting.</Q> This was made a crime in Skirving, when you &s;ee it was the duty of his office, to attend as many commit|tees as he could &s;pare time for. <Q>The office of Trea&s;urer &s;hall be to receive and pay all monies &s;ubject to the regulations to be at any time adopted by the Convention or Committee of Finance. The office of Door-keepers, is to prevent the ad|mi&s;&s;ion of any per&s;ons not Members except by &s;pecial leave of the Council of the Table.</Q> This was to prevent improper company; I do not mean &s;pies, for on the contrary, when they were known they were preferably admitted though with the contempt they de&s;erved, and which no cla&s;s in Society can de|&s;erve more than them&s;elves, unle&s;s it be the men who employ them. And now follows the head of Committees. <Q>No Com|mittee &s;hall be compo&s;ed of more than thirteen, or le&s;s than three per&s;ons; and the number of each Committee &s;hall be decided by a &s;how of hands in the Convention. All Committees &s;hall be cho&s;en, unle&s;s otherwi&s;e ordered, at the time of their appointment; and they &s;hall be authorized to invite the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of &s;uch Members of the Convention as they may think beneficial to the bu&s;ine&s;s entru&s;ted to their charge. All Com|mittees &s;hall be elected from the Leet of the Sections, unle&s;s found nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ome immediate purpo&s;e, in which ca&s;e they &s;hall be appointed by the Convention, one by one, by a &s;how of hands; and they &s;hall &s;it and report progre&s;s, day by day, until their bu&s;ine&s;s is completed. The fir&s;t meeting of every Committee to be fixed by the Convention; every &s;ub&s;e|quent meeting according to their own adjournment.</Q> Now
<PB N="132" REF="027594_0132_0FD54DFFAD1AD448">
comes the head of Council of the Table. <Q>There &s;hall be three A&s;&s;i&s;tants, elected from a Leet given in by the Sections, one to be renewed, and the &s;enior to go out of office daily.</Q> Tho&s;e who had the greate&s;t number of votes were elected, and in con|&s;equence of that, the Convention was likely to be be&s;t &s;erved, for they neither bought their electors nor &s;old them when they had bought them. <Q>The Secretary and A&s;&s;i&s;tants &s;hall form the Council of the Table; they &s;hall prepare a &s;tate of the bu|&s;ine&s;s, for each day &s;hall arrange the order in which the dif|ferent &s;ubjects &s;hall be taken into con&s;ideration, which ar|rangement &s;hall be adhered to, unle&s;s the Convention &s;hould alter the &s;ame by a vote; they &s;hall permit a Member from each Section to take copies of all motions, &amp;c. to be &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ideration of the Sections, and &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t all Mem|bers who reque&s;t their aid, in the wording of any motion they may wi&s;h to lay upon the table.</Q> This brings me back again, to a motion that has been introduced again&s;t me as written evidence, and which Wardlaw was called to prove: he &s;aid, and it was not le&s;s to the di&s;grace of tho&s;e who brought him forward, than to the Friends of the People, of whom he was a member, that he came in a &s;tate of inebriety: he &s;aid he had written out that motion; it is a motion drawn up not by me, but by the Council of the Table, and it is &s;tated in the indictment. <Q>To do this your Committee &s;ugge&s;ts a re&s;olution to the following effect, but which I &s;hall leave to be drawn up by the Council of the Table,</Q> The &s;pirit of the motion was that which the Com|mittee, of which I was the Reporter, had to report, and which motion was to be drawn up by the Council of the Table. <Q>The Council &s;hall have the power to interrupt any debate, for the purpo&s;e of propo&s;ing to the Convention any other bu&s;ine&s;s which they may think more urgent; but the Pre&s;ident &s;hall take the &s;en&s;e of the Convention by a &s;how of hands, whether the debate &s;hall be interrupted or not.</Q> Here you &s;ee this is the greater part of their duty, to judge of &s;uch mo|tions as were laid before them; if they were nugatory they were to inform the per&s;on who brought them of it; if otherwi&s;e, they were to endor&s;e them on the back, they were to hand the motion to the Pre&s;ident, he was to read it to the Convention, and then the vote of the Convention was to determine whether the bu&s;ine&s;s was of &s;ufficient con&s;equence to depart from the or|der of the day. Then follows an article which gives great um|brage to tho&s;e who are frightened at every thing that looks like French: It is the head of Sections: we had the name of divi|&s;ions, and of cla&s;&s;es; but, no name which was agreed to by every body at la&s;t; Section was agreed to by a great majority; and we thought no more of the French Convention at that time, than we did of our new ally the Grand Turk.</P>
<P>To explain to you then what is meant by Sections, and the cau&s;e of adopting that word, which was more from accident
<PB N="133" REF="027594_0133_0FD54E012592BE70">
than any thing el&s;e, it goes on. <Q>All the members of the Con|vention &s;hall be divided by lot, into Sections of 15 per&s;ons each.</Q> And why divided into Sections of 15 per&s;ons each? It was not with a view to overturn the government; it was not with a view of being &s;editious, or riotous, or any thing of the like, but with a view of their meeting, as we had many country Delegates who had much lei&s;ure on their hands, for the purpo&s;e of giving them u&s;eful employments: in the morning they u&s;ed to meet and di&s;cu&s;s the news of the day, and little political to|pics, and thereby came better prepared in the evening; and in the cour&s;e of one week we already found a great difference in their political information; they had already learned to connect their ideas, and form a more accurate judgment of the bu&s;ine&s;s they were about. They were al&s;o to pick out the men who were mo&s;t proper for the nomination of Pre&s;ident for &s;he next night, or for the Committees. The&s;e were the felonious and &s;editious employments of the Sections in the morning. <Q>The Members who may not be able to attend at the fir&s;t divi&s;ion into Sec|tions, &s;hall be divided by lot among the Sections formed; but, if any Section &s;hall have two more than its proper num|ber, no new Member &s;hall draw for that Section until the num|bers are again equal. Every Section &s;hall be furni&s;hed with a complete printed li&s;t of the Convention, containing the name, &s;urname, and the &s;ociety, which each individual repre&s;ents.</Q> And you &s;ee, Gentlemen, here is great regularity; and where men u&s;e &s;uch regularity, they cannot be called a riotous tumul|tuous a&s;&s;embly. <Q>The Sections &s;hall be renewed on every Mon|day during the &s;itting of Convention.</Q> Now, I maintain, that there is no principle in our Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, which pre|vents mutual communication from one man to another, but will encourage that intercour&s;e; for union alone can make us &s;trong, as has been &s;aid, though in a different &s;en&s;e, from the Bench. <Q>The Sections &s;hall meet every forenoon, at eleven o'clock, each in a &s;eparate place; and &s;hall daily choo&s;e a Chairman for the Section, who &s;hall report their leets of election, &amp;c.; and, if the&s;e reports are not delivered into the Council of the Table, immediately on the Chair being taken, they &s;hall be deemed null; each Section &s;hall daily furni&s;h it&s;elf with a note of all the bu&s;ine&s;s, and with copies of all motions and re|ports to be taken into con&s;ideration that evening. The Sec|tions &s;hall daily di&s;cu&s;s the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Convention; they &s;hall prepare li&s;ts of &s;uch per&s;ons as they may think mo&s;t pro|per for Offices. Committees, &amp;c.; but the Sections cannot fi|nally decide any matter; nor, in their collective capacity, give an opinion, or make a propo&s;al to the Convention. No Member in the Sections &s;hall be allowed to vote by proxy.</Q> We did not, you &s;ee, intrench on the privileges of the Hou&s;e of Lords, where they vote by proxy; and we thought, that as every man was equally intere&s;ted in the bu&s;ine&s;s, that he &s;hould
<PB N="134" REF="027594_0134_0FD54E02B218C888">
attend as often as he could; and, if he did not, it &s;hould be his own lo&s;s, by lo&s;ing his vote. <Q>The members of one Section &s;hall not be received into any other Section, during its &s;itting; and, no per&s;on not a member of the Convention, can, on any con&s;ideration, be admitted.</Q> And, I am &s;ure, there is not a man here, who would wi&s;h to be intruded upon by &s;trangers, in the &s;ocial hour, over the bottle, but the &s;ervant comes up with his name, before he is admitted. <STAGE>(Here Mr. Margarot drank a gla&s;s of wine)</STAGE>. I beg pardon, Gentlemen, for this interruption; I &s;hould not have done it, if the example had not been &s;et me; we have no &s;uch thing in England, Gentlemen, as a Jury eat|ing and drinking in Court.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, The next head, is that of motions, A great de|gree of criminality has been attached to the motions that have been produced; but, notwith&s;tanding all this written evidence, which is to tran&s;port us, and prove us nearly guilty of high trea|&s;on, I will &s;hew you the innocent manner in which the&s;e things were to be carried on. <Q>All motions &s;hall be in writing, &s;igned by the Mover and Seconder, and tran&s;mitted to the Council of the Table, who &s;hall number and file them, according to the order in which they are given in. At the clo&s;e of each day's bu&s;ine&s;s, and before the adjournment of the Convention, the Secretary, or one of the Council, &s;hall read all motions given in, during that &s;itting, according to the priority of delivery, in order that they may be copied, and taken into con&s;ideration by the &s;everal Sections; and, being &s;o read, they &s;hall come on for debate the following &s;itting, in the &s;ame order of ar|rangement, made by the Council, unle&s;s the Convention &s;hall think proper to prefer any one of them, as containing matter of greater importance, or more urgent nece&s;&s;ity. A motion once rejected, cannot be brought forward again in the &s;ame Se&s;&s;ion of the Convention, unle&s;s reque&s;ted in writing by 20 members.</Q> This was thought proper to be introduced, in order to &s;ave us trouble, as there were &s;ome men who could &s;peak better than they could write; and who, perhaps, might wi&s;h to be bu&s;y; for we already began to &s;u&s;pect that we had got &s;pies among us, and that motions of a dangerous tendency might be brought in; and, therefore, we endeavoured to pre|vent being led into a trap; for, we found that, in general, it is the mo&s;t hone&s;t men that become the dupes of knaves. <Q>In ca&s;e of two or more motions being on the table, which relate to the &s;ame object, and tend to the &s;ame end, the Council, and the re&s;pective movers, &s;hall u&s;e their be&s;t endeavours to con&s;olidate them all into one before they are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed: but, in ca&s;e the Council and the re&s;pective movers cannot agree in &s;uch mea&s;ure, then the &s;ame &s;hall be finally determined by the Convention. Notwith&s;tanding the above regulations, any Member may &s;ubmit a motion, at any time, to the con&s;i|deration of the Convention, which he deems to be of greater
<PB N="135" REF="027594_0135_0FD54E0423422F20">
importance, or more urgent nece&s;&s;ity than any of tho&s;e which &s;tand in the order of the day; and, if from the rea&s;ons ad|vanced by &s;uch Member, a majority of the Convention &s;hall coincide, in opinion, with him, &s;uch motion &s;hall be immedi|ately brought forward, and determined.</Q></P>
<P>Now, here is that which was drawn up with more care than any other part. We know debates often lead to warmth; and, that when di&s;putants wax warm, they generally grow tumultu|ous and irregular. We have &s;een the&s;e tumults, and this rio|tous manner of debating, even in the Hou&s;e of Commons: we &s;ought to avoid it; and therefore, we ordered, that <Q>no per&s;on &s;hall &s;peak in the ordinary &s;ittings of the Convention, more than once on the &s;ame &s;ubject, unle&s;s it be to explain, or by &s;pecial leave of the Convention; but when all who wi&s;h to &s;peak to the que&s;tion have done &s;o, any Member may be heard again; and, every Member who opens a debate, &s;hall have the privilege of being heard, the la&s;t, in reply, before the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion be finally clo&s;ed. If it &s;hall appear to the mo|ver, or &s;econder of any motion, or to any other member, that the matter contained therein requires the mo&s;t ample di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion, on motion, for that purpo&s;e, made and agreed to, the Pre&s;es &s;hall leave the Chair, for the purpo&s;e of the Conven|tion re&s;olving it&s;elf into a General Committee, in which, a Chairman being fir&s;t appointed, every Member &s;hall be at li|berty to &s;peak as often as the Committee may think proper to hear him, till the que&s;tion &s;hall be called for by an apparent majority. As &s;oon as the que&s;tion &s;hall be called for, and the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion clo&s;ed, the Pre&s;ident &s;hall re&s;ume his &s;eat, and the que&s;tion &s;hall be determined in Convention. The Coun|cil &s;hall require the Pre&s;ident or Chairman; or either of the&s;e may, of his own accord, put a vote for clo&s;ing the debate. When it appears to any of them to be the general wi&s;h of the Convention, or general Committee, there &s;hall, however, be a vote taken; and two to one for clo&s;ing the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, before it actually takes place.</Q> Here we &s;ought, not only to avoid the heat of debate, but we &s;ought to avoid partiality, and we &s;ought to avoid any prejudice that any man might have again&s;t another, or in favour of another, <Q>The que&s;tion of clo&s;ing the debate may, it&s;elf, be debated; but, it mu&s;t be &s;trictly at|tended to, that no Member, under pretence of giving rea&s;ons for or again&s;t clo&s;ing the debate, &s;hall go into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the main que&s;tion.</Q></P>
<P>The next head is, that of Order; a term not borrowed from France, but from the Hou&s;e of Commons of England; for, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, the order of the day is a common phra&s;e. <Q>The Convention &s;hall meet daily, at five o'clock in the after|noon, and &s;hall proceed, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To receive and verify the pow|ers of any new members. <HI>Secondly,</HI> To receive, without reading, the Li&s;ts of Candidates from the Sections, <HI>Thirdly,</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="027594_0136_0FD7BFD4F3F763F8">
To read communications addre&s;&s;ed to the convention. <HI>Fourth|ly,</HI> To elect, from the li&s;ts of candidates, the Committees, if any have been ordered, the new A&s;&s;i&s;tant, and the Pre&s;es. <HI>Fifthly,</HI> To hear from the Council, what is the whole bu&s;ine&s;s &s;tanding for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; and what is that particularly ap|pointed for the day, with the order of priority, propo&s;ed by the Council; which priority may there be debated, and fixed. <HI>Sixthly,</HI> To read over the minutes of the preceding day, and any former days, not finally &s;ettled, and direct corrections of the &s;ame, if need be.</Q> <HI>Seventhly,</HI> To receive reports from the different committees.</P>
<P><Q>In going through the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, the order of pri|ority, fixed as above, &s;hall be adhered to, unle&s;s altered by a vote of the Convention, which mu&s;t, at any time, be put, if de&s;ired by the Council; or, if required in writing, by any five members. Any point, once di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and determined, can neither be re&s;cinded nor brought forward again on the &s;ame day; nor at all, but by a motion regularly made; and, for the bringing in of which, leave &s;hall have been obtained the preceding day. The Reporter of any Committee &s;hall always have a preference to the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, to deliver his report to the Convention, &s;o as not to break in upon any debate which may be before it. Members &s;hall &s;peak in the order in which they ri&s;e for that purpo&s;e; and, if more than one ri&s;e at the &s;ame time, the Pre&s;es &s;hall decide who is entitled to priority.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The pre&s;ident alone &s;hall have the power of interrupting any &s;peaker who wanders from the que&s;tion: but any indivi|dual &s;hall have the right to &s;ugge&s;t his opinion, by writing the word <HI>order,</HI> and handing it to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No member is to be allowed to &s;peak to any &s;ubject after a &s;how of hands has taken place on it.</Q></P>
<P>You will &s;ee by this, that we were not only far from &s;editi|ou&s;ly inclined, but we did not give our tongues a loo&s;e: we were obliged to &s;peak in order, and methodically take our turns, and &s;ay nothing further than what we were entitled to. You will from that gather, that a &s;ociety &s;o well regulated, could not be for the purpo&s;e of overturning the Con&s;titution, which, in its ori|ginal &s;tate, is regularity it&s;elf: we were proceeding in a way that directly led to a reform: the&s;e are the heads; and there remained five more to be fini&s;hed, when we were apprehended by general warrants, and the meeting di&s;per&s;ed by the power of the Sheriff, and of the Lord Provo&s;t; therefore, if we are not in order, it is not our fault, but the fault of tho&s;e who inter|rupted us; yet, you will &s;ee, that we were not altogether &s;o illiterate as &s;ome men, and men of &s;hining, perhaps more &s;hining than &s;olid, abilities have thought proper to repre&s;ent us. We knew what we were about; and all this was done openly: we have had fifty vi&s;itors of a night: any per&s;on &s;ending in his
<PB N="137" REF="027594_0137_0FD7BFE484E73020">
name to the Council of the Table, was his admi&s;&s;ion ticket; and, as I ob&s;erved to you, we &s;ought nothing but the public good: we &s;ought a Parliamentary Reform; we &s;eek it &s;till; and, I tru&s;t, we &s;hall to the end of our lives; and a renovation, not a de|&s;truction, but a renovation of our Con&s;titution. Gentlemen, I will now come to the plain facts &s;tated in the indictment, and then, I will make a few remarks upon the evidence that has been given; and, Gentlemen, I am &s;orry to detain you &s;o long; but, it is my duty to be as explicit as po&s;&s;ible, in this matter, as well as yours to li&s;ten to it: was it my own individual bu&s;ine&s;s, I would meet your verdict this in&s;tant; but I have already told you, that I con&s;ider my&s;elf as the lea&s;t concerned in this matter; it is the cau&s;e of Reform.</P>
<P>The indictment, Gentlemen, accu&s;es me of having been made a Delegate by an A&s;&s;ociation of &s;editious people, calling them|&s;elves the Corre&s;ponding Society of London.</P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, either the charge is true or fal&s;e; if it is fal&s;e, it is malicious; if it is true, then I am the &s;editious per&s;on I am repre&s;ented. The London Corre&s;ponding Society is not a &s;editious &s;ociety; it is a &s;ociety e&s;tabli&s;hed upon as regular and as &s;y&s;tematical a plan as that of the Convention. We are proceed|ing to increa&s;e, to diffu&s;e political knowledge, to make every man acquainted with his political rights: we are formed into di|vi&s;ion, becau&s;e, we well know, that large companies introduce di&s;order and confu&s;ion; therefore, we never &s;uffer, except when general meetings take place: we never &s;uffer above a certain number to a&s;&s;emble together: we a&s;&s;emble in private hou&s;es; neither eat nor drink; but calmly and coolly di&s;cu&s;s the political &s;ubjects before us: we in&s;truct the ignorant, and receive in&s;truc|tion from tho&s;e that know more than we do; and, therefore, the charge that this is an a&s;&s;ociation of &s;editious people, is a fal&s;ehood; and, the Public Pro&s;ecutor backed it with another fal&s;ehood, on the night he did me the honour to try me, in&s;tead of Mr. Skirving: he a&s;&s;erted, that this &s;editious &s;ociety had held a meeting for the purpo&s;e of choo&s;ing Delegates; and, that they were &s;o dete&s;ted by the mob, that the magi&s;trates were obliged to protect them. I was not at liberty to an&s;wer him that night; nor &s;hould I do it now, e&s;pecially in his ab&s;ence, but that im|pre&s;&s;ions unfavourable may have gone forth. It is &s;aid, that the magi&s;trates, an odd doctrine for a crown lawyer to advance, were obliged to take under their protection the &s;editious Lon|don Society, in electing Delegates to &s;end to Edinburgh. If the Corre&s;ponding Society was &s;editious, why did not the ma|gi&s;trates quell us? they were pre&s;ent; and they came with a de&s;ign to di&s;per&s;e us; but the laws are paid a greater regard to in the metropolis than they are at &s;ome di&s;tance from it; and, when they found we were acting upon con&s;titutional principles, they dared not mole&s;t us: there were 500 con&s;tables; and, out of the&s;e 500, I will, to be &s;ure, &s;ay, there were, at lea&s;t, 300
<PB N="138" REF="027594_0138_0FD54E0962FF2310">
out of them, who maintained the &s;ame principles that we did, that a reform was nece&s;&s;ary; that it might be imprudent if the magi&s;trates had acted otherwi&s;e than they did. If any illegal open act of violence had taken place, it mu&s;t have been occa&s;i|oned by them; but they did not commit any act of violence: on the contrary, we placed our&s;elves under the care of the high con&s;table, and his po&s;&s;e; and they attended; but, as in the te&s;|timony of the Lord Provo&s;t, if any riot was occa&s;ioned that day, it was from the magi&s;trates, and their attendants, for our Soci|ety, being &s;o numerous, were obliged to meet in an open field; or, at lea&s;t, a field enclo&s;ed with palings: it was in the neigh|bourhood of Spitalfields; and the people in the neighbourhood, led by curio&s;ity, and not kept at home by work, being out of employ, and might as well dine upon the fre&s;h air as the &s;tag|nate air of Spitalfields it&s;elf, they attended our meeting to the amount of thou&s;ands, and behaved as orderly as tho&s;e men you &s;aw to-day come up the &s;treets; they behaved with the utmo&s;t decency; and the Police Magi&s;trates, from the Police Office, with their police runners, attended, but did not dare to mole&s;t us more than that we invited them to attend our meeting, ina&s;|much as it was con&s;titutional; knowing that they &s;hould di&s;|plea&s;e certain per&s;ons in power, who &s;hall be namele&s;s, they de|clined accepting the invitation of attending; but, after I was no|minated, I returned them thanks for the polite attention they had paid us: they a&s;ked us whether we were to choo&s;e Mem|bers of Parliament; I replied, No; that our object, at Edinburgh, was to communicate with our brethren here, who were like our|&s;elves, pur&s;uing a Reform in Parliament; that would be our bu|&s;ine&s;s in Edinburgh. I told them, if they had any commands, I would execute them: they politely bid me a good day, and drew off their Con&s;tables; and found them&s;elves to be very hap|py in being protected by us: it is true, Sir, the High Con&s;table came to me, and begged of me, as a means of di&s;per&s;ing the mob, that I would de&s;ire the Members of our Society to di&s;per&s;e quietly, fora&s;much as there might be &s;ome riot, &s;ome tumult. I told him, if that was the ca&s;e, we would to a man turn out and a&s;&s;i&s;t the civil officer: that as Reform was our aim, &s;o was order; and, that we would, on every occa&s;ion, protect the civil officer; and, at the &s;ame time, that we a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his duty, we would take care that he did it. And, Gentlemen, my behaviour has been perfectly regular; I have been always ready to come for|ward, and face my country, again&s;t any charges, except, at the fir&s;t in&s;tance, when I was a&s;&s;ailed by &s;ix blackguards, or me&s;&s;en|gers; or, whatever they were, I told them, Take my word, that when ever they required my pre&s;ence, I would be forthcoming: the &s;ame was the ca&s;e in this Court; yet, I did not he&s;itate to appear; I never will fly from ju&s;tice; I will always abide by it; be&s;ides, Gentlemen, if the London Society was &s;editious, but it is not, it is &s;anctioned by a letter, a copy &s;hall be given to each of

you, to peru&s;e at your lei&s;ure: you will &s;ee, that it was a Soci|ety founded upon our con&s;titutional principles; that none of the Mini&s;ters dared offend us: it is true, la&s;t year, &s;everal a&s;&s;ociations were formed all over the kingdom; and, it is they who &s;ounded the toc&s;in; and, where did they originate? they originated in about eleven placemen; the Pre&s;ident, the Chairman of that Society, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es only five places; he was a clerk, or under|&s;trapper, of Lord Hawke&s;bury, his name is Reeves: at the &s;ame time, to prove to you the further con&s;titutionality of our pro|ceedings, we did, in the month of April, hold an a&s;&s;embly, at the Crown and Anchor, in the room above this very man, who was for protecting property again&s;t republicans and levellers: this very man, obliged to bite his nails, in the room underneath, dared not &s;hew his teeth; but he can write; and he is a&s;&s;i&s;ted; I will not &s;ay by the trea&s;ury, but he has pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and has laid the public under contributions; and, here I apply to an ob&s;ervation of the Public Pro&s;ecutor, that we drew money from the deluded, the poor, and the weak. Would to God, no man drew more from the poor, the deluded, and the weak! If no man enjoyed more &s;inecure places than we do, every fami|ly would have bread; which is not now the ca&s;e; while tho&s;e who draw money from the poor, the weak, the deluded, and, I may add, the oppre&s;&s;ed, are revelling in riot and luxury, and all manner of profligacy: while they &s;ell them&s;elves, while they &s;ell others, and their crimes, they cut a figure; but let them re|member, that every guinea that they po&s;&s;e&s;s, con&s;i&s;ts of a certain number of drops of the blood of the poor. He &s;ays, being named a Delegate by an a&s;&s;ociation of &s;editious people, calling them&s;elves the Corre&s;ponding Society of London, did repair to Edinburgh, with the wicked and felonious purpo&s;e of joining and co-operating with an illegal a&s;&s;ociation of evil di&s;po&s;ed and &s;editious per&s;ons, who originally de&s;igned them&s;elves the Gene|ral Convention of the Friends of the People. Now, it &s;eems, that the original Friends of the People, were an illegal a&s;&s;ocia|tion; were an a&s;&s;ociation of evil di&s;po&s;ed and &s;editious per&s;ons. In the indictment, it &s;ays &s;o; but, in the pleading of the Pro&s;e|cutor for the Crown, he &s;ays otherwi&s;e; he &s;ays, that they were harmle&s;s, that they were allowed; and, indeed, the behaviour of the Magi&s;trates toward them, &s;eems to prove the legality of their in&s;titution: he goes on, and charges us with holding vari|ous illegal and &s;editious meetings: how came they to be illegal? If the Friends of the People were in the fir&s;t in&s;tance legal, how came they to be illegal and &s;editious? or where are the proofs that he brings of it? He likewi&s;e &s;ays, they met under a pre|&s;ence of procuring a reform.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you are not to be caught by words: you are men of &s;en&s;e, and &s;en&s;e alone is to operate upon you; rea&s;on and &s;ound &s;en&s;e: how is he to tell? how is he to prove? in what manner has he proved that the&s;e were only pretences?
<PB N="140" REF="027594_0140_0FD54E0CACCC6628">
On the contrary, what I have already &s;hewed you betrays a great &s;y&s;tem of regularity and order; and order will never be introduced for the &s;ake of forwarding confu&s;ion; and yet, he &s;ays, they were evidently of a dangerous and de&s;tructive ten|dency; though I &s;tartle at the words, evidently of a dangerous and de&s;tructive tendency; yet, if you allow me to add a few words to that &s;entence, I will &s;hew they are &s;trictly true; for, if you apply the&s;e words to the abu&s;es which have crept into the Con&s;titution, you will make Engli&s;h, you will make &s;en&s;e, and you will make truth of it. He &s;ays, we imitat|ed, in the form and tenor of our proceedings, that Conven|tion of people, the avowed enemies of this country: the&s;e people, the avowed enemies of this country, fight with guns, bayonets, and cannon: we do the &s;ame; and, yet I don't &s;uppo&s;e that we are guilty of oppo&s;ing, arm to arm: the Hou&s;e of Commons, whom we are &s;eeking to reform, and wi&s;h to new model, if po&s;&s;ible, upon the plan of a more frequent renovation, u&s;es the &s;ame regulations that we do; but order can never be criminal. Gentlemen of the Jury, he &s;ays, likewi&s;e, that I did act as Pre&s;es or Chairman of their meetings: this, likewi&s;e, he has failed to prove: he has proved that I acted once as Chair|man; and, therefore, cannot be guilty of acting as Chairman at their meetings; at lea&s;t, he is inaccurate in his language; but, in England, &s;uch an inaccuracy would be fatal to the indict|ment.</P>
<P>Although it has been &s;aid that I was an Attorney by one; and, by another, that I know nothing of law, I hope to prove, that I know &s;omething of the Con&s;titution; and, that if I am no At|torney, I have as much hone&s;ty as any Attorney, or any Gen|tleman of the gown. It goes on, that various inflammatory votes and re&s;olutions were pa&s;&s;ed. Of this, I tru&s;t, the Public Pro|&s;ecutor has failed to produce an evidence: there is no vote, no re&s;olution of an inflammatory nature, ina&s;much as to under&s;tand the word inflammatory; it means, not merely, that which will inflame it&s;elf, but that which will inflame others: now, the word introduced, as inflammatory, had no manner of connec|tion with the Convention at large, and was ordered by it, to have been burnt: there, indeed he is right; it might have been inflammatory; when burning, it was inflammatory; but that inflammatory nature was no way &s;editious. Continuing then, in the &s;wollen and delu&s;ive language of the indictment, he &s;tates, that the &s;aid Maurice Margarot, did al&s;o, "when attending in his capacity of Delegate, at the illegal meetings of the &s;aid A&s;&s;o|ciation, utter, and make various &s;editious and inflammatory &s;peeches, tending to vilify our pre&s;ent happy Con&s;titution, and to withdraw therefrom, the confidence and attachment of our &s;ubjects." I have already proved, that the only end of our meeting, was to revert to our Con&s;titution; but, it &s;eems, that there is a terrible confu&s;ion of ideas. He accu&s;es me with hav|ing,
<PB N="141" REF="027594_0141_0FD54E0FE6886528">
while attending my duty, as Delegate, in the&s;e meetings of the Convention, with having made &s;everal inflammatory &s;peeches, tending to vilify our pre&s;ent happy Con&s;titution; and, to withdraw, therefrom, the confidence and attachment of our &s;ubjects: That that is a wrong &s;tatement, will be evident, at fir&s;t &s;ight: by what you have already been told, you mu&s;t have di&s;covered, that men, &s;eeking a Reform, cannot wi&s;h to do in|jury to that very Con&s;titution which will procure to them that Reform; for, we are not &s;o blind as not to &s;ee, that our origi|nal Con&s;titution, if we revert to its original principles, does give us the Reform we want; but his way of proving the inflamma|tory &s;peech is very curious. And, particularly, the &s;aid "Mau|rice Margarot did, at a meeting of &s;aid Convention, held on Tue&s;day, 19th November la&s;t, 1793, or on &s;ome other day of that month, in a Ma&s;on Lodge, or room in Blackfriars Wynd; in the city of Edinburgh, wickedly and feloniou&s;ly make the following motion, or one of a &s;imilar import." This, you will recollect, is to be the vilifying of our pre&s;ent happy Con&s;tituti|on, and our withdrawing therefrom the attachment of our &s;ub|jects. Now, you will &s;ee what that motion is, which he ad|duces in &s;upport of that proof: That, previous to publi&s;hing an Addre&s;s to the Public, a Committee be forthwith appointed to con&s;ider the means, and draw up the outlines of a plan of general union and corporation between the two nations, in their con&s;titutional pur&s;uit of a thorough Parliamentary Reform. He brings you forth a motion, as written evidence; and, he tells you, this is done for the purpo&s;e of &s;ubverting our pre&s;ent hap|py Con&s;titution, and withdrawing therefrom the attachment of our &s;ubjects: you certainly will not take it ami&s;s, if I recal to your mind what I &s;aid before, that it was an attempt to impo&s;e upon your under&s;tandings; for there is not one of you fifteen that has a &s;ervant about your hou&s;e, &s;o imbecile, as to &s;uppo&s;e that a plan of union would tend to vilify our pre&s;ent happy Con|&s;titution, and withdraw, therefrom, the confidence and attach|ment of our &s;ubjects: it might, very well, when helped for|ward with all the brilliancy of ge&s;ture, of language, of action, which he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; but, when you come to look into it, it is a direct fal&s;ehood: let us call things by their proper name: it is a direct fal&s;ehood; it does not &s;upport it&s;elf then further, that motion having pa&s;&s;ed unanimou&s;ly; and, which motion, clearly demon&s;trated a wi&s;h and intention on the part of the &s;aid Maurice Margarot, of propagating the &s;editious tenets of that A&s;&s;ociation over the whole kingdom; and, of exciting our &s;ub|jects in England, in contempt of legal authority, to adopt the &s;ame uncon&s;titutional conduct with the &s;aid Maurice Margarot, and his a&s;&s;ociates, had pre&s;umed to follow. Gentlemen, I have been told, that in Scotland, I am as much a &s;tranger as if I had come from Germany, from Italy, from America; and yet, a Court which cannot bring witne&s;&s;es from England, can try me
<PB N="142" REF="027594_0142_0FD54E10E31B2AD8">
for what was charged to be done in England: in &s;hort, it is a farrago of non&s;en&s;e. Were I better acquainted with the Public Pro&s;ecutor, I &s;hould have thought he meant to have &s;et forth my poor &s;ervices in the Convention; and, there|fore, brought me forward to explain the nature of it, the contempt of legal authority. Where has it been &s;hewn? No where: on the contrary, we had the auction of legal autho|rity; Pitt and Dundas both knew we were coming down: the Magi&s;trates of Edinburgh knew we were a&s;&s;embling for that pur|po&s;e; unle&s;s the contempt was, that we did not go and a&s;k them leave: perhaps, had we been &s;trolling players, we might; for, I am told, that a town-hall, not far from Edinburgh, was refu&s;ed to the Friends of the People; and, the next night, permitted to a company of &s;trolling players: probably the &s;trolling players are the mo&s;t beneficial members of &s;ociety. Gentlemen, you &s;ee what hard&s;hips I labour under, no being able to get at my ex|culpating witne&s;&s;es and papers, the witne&s;&s;es being above the laws of the country. The Lord Advocate, when he &s;ays it was in contempt of legal authority, utters a fal&s;hood: not even your Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Laing, who goes about knocking people down in the &s;treet, his legal authority had not &s;hewn it&s;elf; and, therefore it was not in contempt of any legal authority what|ever. We took our own room; burnt our own candles; and no|body had any thing to do with it but our&s;elves: there was no contempt of any legal authority; and, therefore, that part mu&s;t be expunged; as al&s;o, that which relates to England; over which, you &s;ay, you have no juri&s;diction. Again, I find among my high crimes and mi&s;demeanors, the word <HI>toc&s;in;</HI> and, a learned Judge has &s;aid, that we took it from the French: ano|ther per&s;on has &s;aid, taking up, I &s;uppo&s;e, what had dropped from the learned Judge, that it was a French word: unfortu|nately it happens to be borrowed even by them: it is a Chine&s;e word, &s;ignifying a &s;hrill &s;ound; a bell that is rung when danger is near; and, you know, the greater part, or all the words of the Chine&s;e language, mean one and the &s;ame thing; and, there|fore they are obliged to couple a member of them, in order to convey what they mean, e&s;pecially when it carries a complicate idea with it.</P>
<P>Again, a motion is deemed very &s;editious; for, having appoint|ed a Committee for the particular purpo&s;e of watching every act which may militate again&s;t the rights of the people; it is fir&s;t fal&s;e, that &s;uch a Committee has been appointed; but, if it had been appointed, we &s;hould, in the French term, have de&s;erved well of our country, for our vigilance; for, let me call to your mind, in all the high offices of tru&s;t, you find very few people willing to &s;tep forward, and &s;erve you for nothing; and that would have been the ca&s;e, if we had appointed this Committee: we &s;hould have been labouring for you, at our own expence; being your centinels, watching, that none of your rights might
<PB N="143" REF="027594_0143_0FD7BFDE194A03A8">
be encroached, while you &s;lept; but it may be proper here to animadvert likewi&s;e upon the blank that was produced as cri|minal, and more criminal than the written evidence: it was &s;aid, that the re&s;olution which ought to fill the blank, was of &s;uch a nature, that it mu&s;t not appear till the end of the Re|&s;olutions. I will explain that to the &s;atisfaction of the Jury; but, it mu&s;t be by reading to them the whole di&s;cour&s;e. Here is a motion, &s;uppo&s;ed to be made by Mr. Callendar, That in ca&s;e the Mini&s;ter, of any other Member, bring into the Hou&s;e of Commons, a motion for a Convention Bill, as pa&s;&s;ed in Ire|land, for preventing the people from meeting, according to their ju&s;t rights, by the Revolution, the &s;ame motion &s;hall be noticed to the Delegates of the re&s;pective Societies immediately, to meet in Convention, to a&s;&s;ert their rights; and, then they make me &s;ay, this is an excellent motion; and the event which it al|ludes to, ought to be the toc&s;in to the Friends of Liberty to a&s;&s;em|ble: it &s;eems, however, to be imperfect; it does not mention any place of meeting: neither does it &s;pecify the time when the Delegates are to a&s;&s;emble; for the word <HI>immediately</HI> is indefi|nite, and will not convey the &s;ame meaning to per&s;ons re&s;iding in different parts of the country: by tho&s;e who live near to the place of meeting, it will be under&s;tood, that they are to repair there next day; by tho&s;e at a greater di&s;tance within a few days; and by tho&s;e &s;till farther off, within a week after &s;uch informa|tion is received. Gentlemen, you will remember, I have read to you eight chapters, the produce of the Committee of Regula|tions; you will &s;ee what &s;pirit actuated them, when they draw up tho&s;e regulations; and that there was nothing &s;editious in their tendency. Here, I am then made to &s;ay, that this motion comes properly under the chapter of regulations; I wi&s;h it were referred to that Committee; I therefore move, that the report be read, that the Convention may judge, whether the article I al|lude to, &s;ufficiently provides for the intention of the motion now before the Convention. Here you &s;ee, fir&s;t, my di&s;&s;ent to that motion of Mr. Callendar's: the one which the Committee of Re|gulations had drawn up, was in a different &s;tyle, and would have come in extremely well at the end of the regulations; in|&s;tead of which, the Convention &s;pliced the one with the other; they adopted the motion of Mr. Callendar, and propo&s;ed to bring it in as amended by Mr. Sinclair, and others; and, the next day, they propo&s;ed to bring it in at the end of the proceed|ings; that the only my&s;tery that has given &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s to the Public Accu&s;er; while, at the &s;ame time, he might have done away a great deal of your &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and, likewi&s;e, have made him&s;elf much ea&s;ier; for, I believe, he is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that motion, but did not think proper to produce it, becau&s;e it would not have an&s;wered his end of criminating me; however, I will invalidate it entirely, for the Public Accu&s;er is bound to bring forward the be&s;t evidence he can adduce: he has not
<PB N="144" REF="027594_0144_0FD7BFDF2D496628">
brought that evidence forward: he has told you, that he has got it, but has not produced it; therefore, you are not to believe him on his word; and, I believe, that is not the only fal&s;ehood point|ed out, that will engage you to di&s;believe any thing he may a&s;|&s;ert. I will read a pa&s;&s;age from the Gazetteer, which will &s;hew, that other men have been the victims of his fal&s;ehood, as well as my&s;elf. Gazetteer, 7th January, &s;igned by a man of great re|&s;pectability, both as to truth and fortune; a man &s;till more re|&s;pectable by education, and by his virtue; he is a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of 6000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, and upwards; lays the chief part of that mo|ney out, not in luxury, or in profligate living, but in relieving the nece&s;&s;ities of the poor; I mean Mr. Archibald Hamilton Rowan, who has been called one of the wretches of Ireland.</P>

<P>This is what they call in plain vulgar Engli&s;h, giving a man the lye; and when the name is affixed to it, this man is of an equally high character, and his intrin&s;ic character makes him rank at lea&s;t with the official character of the public pro&s;ecutor. I dare &s;ay he is not a man, who would fix his name to a fal&s;e|hood; and if he had, his fal&s;ehood would have been contra|dicted; and it &s;eems that here the public pro&s;ecutor is very full of &s;pirit, and therefore would have re&s;ented this injury. He has &s;ilently acknowledged the truth of it, and the man who will tell a fal&s;ehood in one in&s;tance, will tell it in general; therefore be wary how you tru&s;t merely to his a&s;&s;ertion, e&s;pecially with an object like this in view, the extirpation of abu&s;es upon which he and his relatives fatten; for his uncle reaps upwards of 20,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year of the public money as Secretary of State. Were abu&s;es to be rectified, the&s;e &s;alaries would be dimini&s;hed; were the&s;e abu&s;es to be rectified, it is po&s;&s;ible his conduct would be enquired into as mo&s;t likely it will &s;peedily. You &s;ee by this, Gentlemen, that where any thing tending to exculpate me could be adduced, he has kept it back; but he has not done it &s;imply and fairly, but aggravated it; I have greater proof of this man's guilt, but I will not produce it; whereas, it is an extenuation of guilt. Here is another act of criminality in this motion; by the by, it &s;eems very inconvenient in the practice of the law of Scotland, that one crime may affect many per&s;ons, if it is only by holding

finger to finger, art and part as it is called here; and here, Gen|tlemen, it may be as well to revert to the opinion of the Solicitor General of King William upon that &s;ubject. Sir John Hawles &s;ays, <Q>As Juries have ever been ve&s;ted with &s;uch powers by law, &s;o to exclude them from, or di&s;&s;ei&s;e them of the &s;ame, were utterly to defeat the end of their in&s;titution; for then if a per|&s;on &s;hould be indicted for doing any common innocent act, if it be but clothed and di&s;gui&s;ed in the indictment with the name of trea&s;on:</Q> So that you &s;ee, even in King William's time, there were frivolous per&s;ecutions as well as at pre&s;ent; I meant to call them pro&s;ecutions, I beg pardon; and that if the Jury did not &s;tep in between the crown lawyer and the &s;ubject, the &s;ubject having no redre&s;s, was incarcerated, fined, bani&s;hed, or otherwi&s;e ill u&s;ed, and all for things, which in them&s;elves were perfectly innocent; but being clothed in tremendous lan|guage, appear heinous crimes, &s;uch as I was mentioning ju&s;t now, and is reported here; <Q>If any per&s;on &s;hould be indicted for doing any common innocent act, if it be but clothed and di&s;gui&s;ed in the indictment with the name of trea&s;on, or &s;ome other high crime, and proved by witne&s;&s;es to have been done by him, the Jury, though &s;atisfied in con&s;cience that the fact is not any &s;uch offence as it is called, yet becau&s;e (according to this fond opinion) they have no power to judge of law, and the fact charged is fully proved, they &s;hall at this rate be bound to find him guilty.</Q>&mdash;Thus you will if you find me guilty, refer me to the mercy of the court&mdash;I &s;hall not detain you much longer; you have attended me with &s;ingular patience, Gentlemen of the Jury, and I thank you for it&mdash;you are doing your country good. Di&s;tingui&s;h then the true friends of your country from its foes. You have &s;een that the te&s;timony of every witne&s;s adduced on the part of the Crown is one weaker than another; that it all turns upon the point of the meeting being Seditious; whereas, in verity, as the law term is, the meeting was founded upon the claim of rights&mdash;that it is the privilege of the &s;ubject to &s;eek redre&s;s; and I mu&s;t take the li|berty of quoting to you &s;omething from De Foe, which will prove to you, that the people have a right&mdash;that the original power re&s;ts with them, and that they have a right to control that pow|er, and keep on it a continual check; for as I &s;aid before, the &s;ervant is not greater than the ma&s;ter, and the King is but the chief &s;ervant of the nation. It is true we do not exerci&s;e our au|thority over him, or if we do, it is but once in two or three cen|turies; and I hope it will be centuries before we &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion to exerci&s;e it again. But there are tho&s;e who exerci&s;e the regal power in his name, and the &s;ooner they are brought to condign puni&s;hment, the &s;ooner it will prevent others from pur|&s;uing the &s;ame da&s;tardly pur&s;uits. This is a chapter of De Foe; he is treating of the original power of the collective body of the people of England.&mdash;<Q>To the King. Sir, it is not the lea&s;t of
<PB N="146" REF="027594_0146_0FD54E16E0A19788">
the extraordinaries of your Maje&s;ty's character, that as you are King of your people, &s;o you are the people's King. This title, as it is the mo&s;t glorious, &s;o it is the mo&s;t indi&s;putable in the world. God him&s;elf appointed, the prophet proclaimed, but the people's a&s;&s;ent was the fini&s;hing, the royal authority of the fir&s;t King of I&s;rael. Your Maje&s;ty, among all the ble&s;|&s;ings of your reign, has re&s;tored this as the be&s;t of all our en|joyments, the full liberty of our original right in its actings and exerci&s;e.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>This was publi&s;hed in the year 1705, &s;oon after the revolution. <Q>Former reigns have invaded it, and the la&s;t thought it totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; but as liberty revived under your Maje&s;ty's ju&s;t authority, this was the fir&s;t flower &s;he brought forth;</Q> that is to &s;ay, the acting and exerci&s;e of our liberties and original rights, which are tho&s;e which you have &s;een in Mr. Wharton's &s;peech, of petitioning and obtaining redre&s;s; of keeping a con&s;tant check upon every &s;ervant of the Crown, in whatever &s;ituation he may be placed; and of obtaining a fair and equal repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>He &s;ays in another place,&mdash;<Q>I have ob&s;erved, when intere&s;t obliges any per&s;on or party to defend the cau&s;e they have e&s;|pou&s;ed, they plea&s;e them&s;elves with fancying they conceal their private de&s;igns, like a late Act of Parliament, which in the preamble calls it&s;elf an Act for the relief of Creditors; but which in its effect, was an act for the relief of Debtors.</Q> This is like men who cry up the Con&s;titution, and live upon its defects. <Q>Thus &s;ome Gentlemen place fine &s;pecious titles on their books; as <HI>Jura Populi Anglicani;&mdash;A Vindication of the Rights of the Commons of England, and a Vindication of the Rights of the Lords;</HI> and with large and high encomiums upon the excellency of our Con&s;titution, treat the levity of &s;ome people's judgments with fine notions; whereas, the true end and de&s;ign is defending the intere&s;t and party they have e&s;pou&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>Gentlemen, call to mind whether it may not be the ca&s;e with one of us two, the Pannel or the Public Pro&s;ecutor, whether we may not be trumpeting up or &s;ounding the prai&s;e of the con|&s;titution, and at the &s;ame time have intere&s;ted and private views; and as it has been &s;aid you cannot penetrate into the minds of men, you can only judge from the tenor of their conduct; hi|therto he has acknowledged him&s;elf to be a placeman, though not a pen&s;ioner. Gentlemen, I take my God to witne&s;s, that were I to be offered one of the mo&s;t profitable places under Go|vernment, my con&s;cience would not permit me to accept the emoluments of it, when I know that it has been drawn from the blood and the &s;weat of the poor: that there has been more blood &s;pilt within this la&s;t twelvemonth, for the purpo&s;e of gratifying Mini&s;try, and keeping the public mind from reform, than would completely fill the large&s;t &s;hip now in the Briti&s;h navy, and I &s;peak within compa&s;s, <Q>The defence of the rights of the re|pre&s;entative body of the people, under&s;tood by the name of
<PB N="147" REF="027594_0147_0FD54E18651C4268">
the Common of England in Parliament, is a <HI>great point,</HI> and &s;o plain are their rights, that it is no extraordinary ta&s;k to de|fend them; but for any man to advance, that they are &s;o au|gu&s;t an a&s;&s;embly, that no objection ought to be made to their actions, nor to reflect upon their conduct, though the fact be true; and that it is not to be examined, whether the thing &s;aid be true, but what authority the per&s;on &s;peaking has to &s;ay, it is a doctrine wholly new.</Q></P>
<P>You &s;ee, Gentlemen, it was a doctrine new a hundred years ago, in the time of De Foe, but it is a doctrine renewed now to &s;erve the&s;e &s;tate pro&s;ecutions; it is highly &s;editious, and of a very evil tendency in the public at pre&s;ent to examine into the conduct of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and yet at that time it was con&s;titutional; why, becau&s;e we have brought in the pre&s;ent family, and that they had entered into a contract with the peo|ple; they would not &s;uffer their &s;ervants to deviate from it at fir&s;t; at pre&s;ent, through lap&s;e of time that is grown ob&s;olete, and their &s;ervants' &s;ervants tell you, you are not even to examine into it; prai&s;e the Con&s;titution, and think your&s;elves happy, whether you are &s;o or not. <Q>It is doctrine wholly new, and &s;eems to me to be a badge of more &s;lavery to our own repre|&s;entatives, than ever the people of England owes them, or than ever they them&s;elves expected. This therefore, toge|ther with &s;ome inva&s;ions of the people's rights, made public by &s;everal modern authors;</Q> You &s;ee the rights of the people were begun already, then to be invaded, <Q>are the rea&s;ons why I have adventured <HI>(being wholly di&s;intere&s;ted and unconcerned either for per&s;ons or parties)</HI> to make a &s;hort e&s;&s;ay at declaring the rights of the people of England, not repre&s;entatively, but collectively con&s;idered. And with due deference to the repre&s;entative body of the nation, I hope I may &s;ay <HI>it can be no diminution of their rights,</HI> to a&s;&s;ert the rights of that body from whom they derived the powers and privileges of their Hou&s;e, and which are the very foundation of their be|ing.</Q></P>
<P>This refers to what I &s;aid to you ju&s;t now, the &s;ervant cannot be higher than the ma&s;ter; if they derive their powers from us, we entertain powers &s;uperior to theirs; it is therefore our duty to &s;ee that they acquit them&s;elves of the ta&s;k repo&s;ed in them, and con&s;equently all the meetings of the people for tho&s;e pur|po&s;es are con&s;titutional, and not &s;editious and inflammatory, as &s;ounded by the Public Accu&s;er. <Q>For if the original right of the people be overthrown, the power of the Repre&s;entative, which is &s;ub&s;equent and &s;ubordinate, mu&s;t die of it&s;elf, and becau&s;e I have to do rather with rea&s;on and the nature of the thing, than with laws and precedents.</Q> I am happy to find that De Foe &s;tood in the &s;ituation I now do. I have, Gentlemen, to do before you with rea&s;on and the nature of the thing: I have to deal with your rea&s;on: I like that much better than law
<PB N="148" REF="027594_0148_0FD54E19F360BD90">
or precedents; rea&s;on is an emanation of the divine Being; laws are but the formation of that emanation, and the farther the rays diverge from the centre, the weaker they grow.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you will find that the plain doctrine that I am laying down, has been the language of all times and all ages, is the doctrine of truth it&s;elf; and that I am acting for the public advantage, and not for private or per&s;onal emolument; and be|cau&s;e I have to do rather with rea&s;on and the nature of the thing, than with law and precedents. The Crown Lawyers can con|fu&s;e and confound a man not bred to the law: They can con|found a juryman with the du&s;t from the old mu&s;ty law books, and lull his rea&s;oning to &s;leep with words conveying a very dif|ferent meaning to what ought to be attached to them. <Q>To come directly to what I de&s;ign in the following papers, it is nece&s;&s;ary to lay down &s;ome maxims other than what a late au|thor has furni&s;hed us with; <HI>&s;alus populi &s;uprema lex.</HI></Q> This will not be controverted by any body, the welfare of the people is the fir&s;t of all laws; and remember this, Gentlemen, <Q>all government, and con&s;equently our whole Con&s;titution, was originally de&s;igned and is maintained for the &s;upport of the people's property, who are the governed.</Q> It is for the &s;up|port of the people, not for the &s;upport of the governor, <Q>that all the members of Government, whether Kings, Lords, or Commons, if they invert the great de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, the public good, cea&s;e to be in the &s;ame public capacity.</Q> You &s;ee, De Foe ab&s;olutely &s;u&s;pends them from their function, the moment they cea&s;e to devote their talents to the public good. How many of our placemen and pen&s;ioners would be &s;u&s;pended, if that law was &s;till put in execution! <Q>And power retreats to its original, that no collective or repre&s;entative body of men what&s;oever, in matters of politics any more than religion, <HI>are or ever have been infallible.</HI></Q> Here is the axe at the root of the omnipotence of Parliament, <Q>That rea&s;on is the te&s;t and touch|&s;tone of laws, and that all law or power that is contradictory to rea&s;on, is <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> void in it&s;elf, and ought not to be obey|ed. Some other maxims le&s;s general, are the con&s;equence of the&s;e: as <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> that &s;uch laws as are agreeable to rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, being once made, are binding both to King, Lords, and Commons, either &s;eparately or conjunctively, till actually repealed in due form.</Q> Thus much, I differ from many great men in the law at pre&s;ent; who &s;ay, that a bad law when once found to be a bad law, ought to be di&s;obeyed in order to get it broken. On the contrary I am for obeying, and every good ci|tizen is for obeying and paying re&s;pect to the laws, and to no|thing but the laws; and while a law is in force, let it be never &s;o bad, I will obey it; I will point out if I can the errors of the law, but I will obey it while it is in exi&s;tence; from that confe&s;&s;ion of faith, you may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e that another article of accu&s;a|tion will fall to the ground, which is that our Convention was
<PB N="149" REF="027594_0149_0FD7BFE5ECFE1100">
to a&s;&s;emble and militate again&s;t the Parliament, in ca&s;e of the introduction of a Convention Bill: We were to overawe in the language of the public Pro&s;ecutor; to overawe the Parliament; to check them in their proceedings: &s;o we were: but how? as a body of men we could do nothing till we had a majority of the nation on our &s;ide. When once the majority of the Society is of one way of thinking, it is proper that the minority &s;hould yield to it, and that is the fir&s;t law of Society; and as the general good is to be paramount to every thing, &s;o the will of the few is to &s;ubmit to the will of the many; and therefore, the object of our in&s;titution was fir&s;t to diffu&s;e political knowledge; and &s;econdly, to gather the general will. If we found that general will, to be for a reform in Parliament, a Reform in Par|liament we &s;hould obtain; if we are to be &s;laves, it is our duty then to &s;it down &s;ilent, and if not &s;atisfied, we may as a noble Lord has &s;aid, take our pack on our back, and be trudging. My Lord, at another &s;ea&s;on I might not talk improfitably, but at the pre&s;ent late hour of the night, I think in my mind that I have &s;aid &s;ufficiently to acquit my&s;elf of all the charges laid again&s;t me, if you will be kind enough to dive&s;t your&s;elves of any pre|judice which public papers, public rumours, or public prejudices, may have in&s;pired again&s;t me; to examine not merely the man; I am my&s;elf, a willing and a devoted victim to my country.</P>
<P>I know if I am left to the mercy of the court, how that mercy will di&s;play it&s;elf; but if it can profit the cau&s;e that I &s;hould be a victim, I am willing it &s;hould be &s;o: I have faced death before now: I am not afraid of it now, you &s;ee that I am not agitated. I am as cool as your&s;elves; I have &s;tudied this affair well: I un|dertook it not &s;anctioned by a Pitt, a Richmond, or a Dundas: I adopted it upon rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, and I will quit it only with life. Gentlemen, you repre&s;ent you country: your &s;ituation is awful; you are now to guard its liberties; you are now to en|courage the plant of reform; a mild and peaceful reform, ac|cording to the temper of men's minds, now may be ea&s;ily effect|ed; but beware of per&s;ecution carried on with too much rigour. We know, and hi&s;tory &s;hews us, that at a certain pitch of op|pre&s;&s;ion the people will bear it no longer, and an uninformed multitude, is what every well-&s;tudied government, every well conducted government &s;hould fear to incen&s;e. It has been the policy of Europe, and it is a popi&s;h policy, and I am &s;orry to &s;ay, we now number two among our Allies who make much u&s;e of that policy; I mean tho&s;e who encourage the inqui&s;ition and the bow-&s;tring, the Pope and the Turk, who have both now amba&s;|&s;adors at our Court. It is their policy that the people &s;hould be ignorant; it has been the policy of the prie&s;thood, it has been the policy of fal&s;e politicians; but I hope the time is coming, when men will open their eyes to their true intere&s;t, and that &s;ea&s;on when riches are no longer to be poured upon one man without mea&s;ure, while a thou&s;and others are &s;tarving. It is
<PB N="150" REF="027594_0150_0FD54E1DA75054C0">
nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be a di&s;tinction of ranks, and it will take place, but let merit be the way to public offices; &s;tudy that, and you will find your&s;elves better &s;erved, not as the pre&s;ent cu&s;|tom is, the cou&s;in of one Lord, and the &s;on of another is to be the proprietor of a borough; the&s;e are things much wanted to be reformed.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, you have &s;een how &s;light the charges again&s;t me are; you have had intimation of what the mercy will be that I &s;hall experience. A further intimation that orders have been i&s;&s;ued, though the part from whence tho&s;e orders came, have not been developed to you; yet let me recur to your claim of rights; it is contrary to the laws of Scotland, that any Magi&s;trate of Scotland &s;hould act according to any order whatever, except it is according to the laws of Scotland, but not according to the orders of any &s;tranger. You are in this ca&s;e, without an appeal in Scotland. You are the repre&s;entatives of the people; they have entru&s;ted you with their rights and privileges; you are to pronounce on me, whether I am guilty or not. I have appeared here to an&s;wer to my country. I hope I have done it to the &s;atisfaction of my country, and I hope you will do it honor by your verdict; though the &s;ophi&s;try of the public Pro&s;ecutor has appeared in all its defects, I hope that &s;ound &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on are at work in your minds, and I hope there is not one among you fifteen, but what is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an hone&s;t heart. Con&s;ider; I tell you con&s;ider not me&mdash;con&s;ider your country. Con&s;ider the cau&s;e, and con&s;ider the futility of the charge that is brought again&s;t me. I am &s;orry to have detained you &s;o long, but it is a &s;erious affair, and your verdict will not be confined within the&s;e walls; the eyes of Britain are now upon you fifteen men, whom I don't even know by name, and who perhaps never &s;aw me be|fore, nor I you; then examine me well, &s;ee if there is any thing &s;editious in my appearance or behaviour; &s;ee if there is any thing illegal in what I have done, though not ver&s;ed in the quirks of the law; and I am glad of it, for I believe the laws, and the per|ver&s;ion of the laws by the practice, have made many an hone&s;t man a knave. You will &s;ee whether I am guilty of the charge laid again&s;t me, what proportion of guilt is attached to me; whether any part is proved home to me; whether any part is legal proof, and whether I was not &s;erving my country; and I cannot he&s;itate a moment to think but that your verdict will do honour to your country, and ju&s;tice to me.&mdash;Gentlemen, I take my leave of you.&mdash;</P>

<P>Gentlemen of the Jury, I dare &s;ay every man in Court is fa|tigued, as I own I am; and after hearing it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to detain you much longer; but I &s;hall make a few general ob&s;erva|tions, which I apprehend may be of &s;ome u&s;e in forming a judg|ment upon this ca&s;e. The crime here charged is the crime of Sedition; and although it is not founded upon any &s;tatute law, it is a crime very well known in the common law of Scotland, and indeed is coeval with the very ju&s;tice of &s;ociety. When man|kind are in a &s;tate of nature, every man is a law to him&s;elf; but as &s;oon as &s;ociety is formed, every member of that &s;ociety be under obligations to one another; to that &s;ociety of which they are members, to maintain the law and con&s;titution of that &s;oci|ety; and every attempt to encroach upon the con&s;titution of that &s;ociety, is a very heinous crime, and very &s;everely puni&s;ha|ble. Gentlemen, it is a crime which affords different degrees of aggravation; according to the nature of it, it may be applied to private matters, and may be le&s;s criminal in that ca&s;e, according to the circum&s;tances. But whenever Sedition has a tendency to overturn the e&s;tabli&s;hed Con&s;titution of the kingdom, it becomes a crime of the mo&s;t heinous nature, and of the mo&s;t dangerous tendency, and it borders indeed upon the crime of high trea&s;on. Gentlemen, the libel here lays the crime charged in the major propo&s;ition, as Sedition; and the public Pro&s;ecutor has &s;tated a variety of facts and circum&s;tances, from which he infers the crime of Sedition, and the conclu&s;ion of the libel is, that all or a part thereof being proven, then he is to be puni&s;hed with the pains of law; which pains of law in this ca&s;e, is an arbitrary pu|ni&s;hment, and which the Court will make more or le&s;s, according as they think the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, although the Pro&s;ecutor has detailed a variety of facts and circum&s;tances, all of which I &s;hall &s;hortly &s;tate to you, yet it is not nece&s;&s;ary that every fact and circum&s;tance &s;hould be proved, in order to obtain a verdict of guilty; becau&s;e, if you are of opinion that &s;uch facts and circum&s;tances are proved, as are &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h again&s;t the Pannel an accu&s;ation of the crime of Sedition, it founds you in a verdict of guilty. If upon examination of the whole circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, you &s;hould be of opinion, that nothing is proved to e&s;tabli&s;h the crime of
<PB N="152" REF="027594_0152_0FD7BFEFAD6E7670">
Sedition again&s;t him, you will find him not guilty, or the libel not proven. And, Gentlemen, the fir&s;t thing to be attended to is this, whether the Society who call them&s;elves the Briti&s;h Con|vention of Delegates, from what you &s;ee of them, can be reck|oned a &s;editious &s;ociety or not;&mdash;that is the fir&s;t thing you will inve&s;tigate. And, Gentlemen, it is a very material circum|&s;tance, which you will have under your ob&s;ervation in forming your judgment; and it is this that that Society &s;tands upon, the record of this Court not above &s;ix or &s;even days old, to be a &s;e|ditious &s;ociety; when a per&s;on, a &s;ecretary to that &s;ociety, act|ing in that capacity, and a member of that &s;ociety, was found guilty of the crime of &s;edition, and has been by judgment of this Court condemned to tran&s;portation for fourteen years, that is a pretty &s;trong circum&s;tance to &s;hew that this was not an inno|cent meeting. If it was a lawful meeting, I am afraid that poor man, Skirving, has &s;uffered very unju&s;tly. In the fir&s;t place, there was a unanimous verdict of a mo&s;t re&s;pectable Jury again&s;t him. And, in the &s;econd place, the Court pronouncing judg|ment upon that verdict. And indeed, Gentlemen, independent of what was e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the trial of Skirving, I think you will be to con&s;ider, whether upon taking a complex view of the proceedings of the &s;ociety, it has been e&s;tabli&s;hed this day by pa|role evidence, but chiefly by written evidence, which is not &s;o capable of error as the other. I &s;ay, whether upon the whole of the evidence of what has been &s;aid before you, that this was not an innocent meeting, but a meeting of a mo&s;t &s;editious na|ture.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, they &s;ay that the meeting was for a lawful pur|po&s;e, and that at the &s;ame time that they complain of the griev|ances that the &s;ubjects labour under, nothing more was meant than to obtain a reform in parliament. Gentlemen, that is the profe&s;&s;ion of the meeting; but then they are obliged to &s;ay, that becau&s;e their attempting a reform in another mode was a much more criminal act if they did not prevail, but you will attend to the facts, and &s;ee how far what is proved in this ca&s;e, is con|&s;i&s;tent with the idea of a reform in parliament; and when you &s;ee them holding out that the parliament is guilty of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t irregularities, as having no regard to the laws or the good of the &s;ubject, and in &s;hort, that we are at the brink of ruin. When that is the light in which they pretend to hold forth the parlia|ment, it is impo&s;&s;ible to believe but they mu&s;t mean &s;omething el&s;e than a reform in parliament; they could not well expect to get a redre&s;s of their grievances from a parliament whom they have thought proper to &s;tate in &s;uch terms.&mdash;</P>
<P>Gentlemen, if a Society of &s;o many people, dividing them|&s;elves into Sections, Committees, coming from the Sections, motions made, and upon this a Committee of Secrecy appointed, and a Convention of Emergency e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the &s;ittings de|clared permanent, and all that&mdash;Was this nece&s;&s;ary for a reform

in parliament? I think there could be no occa&s;ion for all this &s;ecrecy; an application to parliament &s;eems incon&s;i&s;tent with the idea of it. I am afraid it mu&s;t &s;atisfy you&mdash;you will con&s;i|der the whole of it, whether the evidence does not &s;hew you, that &s;omething el&s;e than a reform in parliament was intended. You &s;ee, that they have e&s;tabli&s;hed a Convention of Emergency, in the ca&s;e of a Convention Bill being brought into parliament, &s;imilar to that brought into the parliament of Ireland. Another was in the ca&s;e of that meeting being di&s;per&s;ed; and the third was in the ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion, or in ca&s;e of the landing of foreign troops. Now &s;uppo&s;ing that they had nothing but fair and ho|ne&s;t intentions in the ca&s;e of a foreign inva&s;ion, they were to join the government to repel that foreign force, was there any thing there that was an object of &s;ecrecy? I think the more pub|lic their re&s;olutions were, when of &s;o virtuous a nature, calcu|lated &s;o much for the good of the public, the more public they were, &s;o much the better: and it could not be an object of &s;e|crecy.</P>
<P>That therefore taking all the&s;e circum&s;tances together, I am afraid that there is nothing but what is irreconcileable with in|nocence. But, Gentlemen, in order to con&s;titute the crime of &s;edition, it is not nece&s;&s;ary that the meeting &s;hould have had in view to overturn the con&s;titution by mobs and by violence, to overturn the King and Parliament; for I apprehend, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e the crime of &s;edition con&s;i&s;t in poi&s;oning the minds of the lieges, which may naturally in the end have a tendency to promote violence again&s;t the &s;tate, and endeavouring to cre|ate a di&s;&s;atisfaction in the country, which nobody can tell where it will end; it will end very naturally in overt rebellion; and if it has that tendency, though not in the view of the parties at the time, yet if they have been guilty of poi&s;oning the minds of the lieges, I apprehend that will con&s;titute the crime of &s;edi|tion to all intents and purpo&s;es. Now, Gentlemen, take a view of the conduct of this meeting, and attend to the time when all this reform, all this noi&s;e and declamation is made again&s;t the con&s;titution; it is at a time when we are at war with a great nation, a cruel ferocious nation, that requires all our &s;trength, and not only our &s;trength, but the &s;trength of all our allies to get the better of them; and the greate&s;t unanimity is nece&s;&s;ary. I &s;ubmit to you, whether a man that wi&s;hes well to his country, would come forward and in&s;i&s;t upon a reform, parliamentary or not parliamentary, at &s;uch a cri&s;is; which would create di&s;con|tent in the minds of the people, when every good &s;ubject would promote unanimity among the lieges to meet the common ene|my. I &s;ay, in place of that, to bring forward a great reform in parliament is a thing totally incon&s;i&s;tent with the con&s;titution of this country. I &s;ay, bringing it forward at that period is a &s;trong proof that they were not well wi&s;hers to the con&s;titution, but enemies to it. I &s;ay that no good member of &s;ociety would
<PB N="154" REF="027594_0154_0FD7BFE1E0A306B8">
have taken tho&s;e mea&s;ures. I appeal to you all, that you are living under a happy government, in peace and plenty, in per|fect &s;ecurity of your lives and property, the happie&s;t nation upon the face of the earth; and when that is the &s;ituation of this country, I appeal to you whether I have not given a fair and ju&s;t de&s;cription of it; for a &s;et of men in that &s;ituation to rai&s;e a faction in the minds of the lower order of the people, and to create di&s;affection to the government, and con&s;equently make a divi&s;ion in that country. I &s;ay, the&s;e things appear to be from the very conjuncture at which they are brought for|ward, &s;edition of a very high nature. Now, Gentlemen, you will take into con&s;ideration the whole proceedings of this meet|ing, and take a view of what &s;tands upon the records of this Court, that that Convention is already determined to be a meet|ing of an illegal nature.</P>
<P>The next que&s;tion is, whether you can pronounce this Gentle|man at the bar innocent. I will lay it down as a principle of law, and not peculiar to this country; it is the principle of the civil law, and I believe the principle of every law in every well-governed &s;tate, that where a number of people are concerned in a crime, that each and all of them are guilty; part or part of acting in different parts in the commi&s;&s;ion of the crime, as &s;ome may have been more active than others, they are all of them in the eye of the law equally guilty, and liable to puni&s;hment; that is the law of Scotland, and I believe of every civilized coun|try, and therefore if this is an unlawful &s;ociety, the man that is pre&s;ident of that &s;ociety, is liable for every thing done in that &s;ociety; and is amenable to a court of ju&s;tice, for the crimes there committed.</P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, the que&s;tion is, if this be a &s;editious Society whether you can pronounce Mr. Margarot innocent. In the fir&s;t place, you &s;ee that the public Pro&s;ecutor has e&s;tabli&s;hed that he was &s;ent down to that very meeting from England, as Delegate; he comes down for no other errand under the &s;un. He leaves his bu&s;ine&s;s of a merchant in London, and attends this meeting in the character of a Delegate; that I apprehend is taking a &s;trong part in the proceedings of this &s;editious illegal Society. You &s;ee him at all the meetings almo&s;t, and you &s;ee him the mo&s;t active of all the meeting. He is chairman upon one occa|&s;ion, and he is making &s;peeches and harangues upon another: and you will attend to that motion by which the Convention of Emergency was e&s;tabli&s;hed, by which a Committee of Secrecy was e&s;tabli&s;hed. The Committee of Secrecy con&s;i&s;ts of four members, and the Pannel is named one of the four, that is in evidence before you; and if you take all the&s;e things together, he comes down to Scotland, leaves his bu&s;ine&s;s in London, and attending the&s;e meetings daily; you &s;ee him taking the active part, making motions, and making that very important motion for a Committee of Secrecy; and he was named one of the
<PB N="155" REF="027594_0155_0FD54E25230FE808">
Committee. I leave it to you, Gentlemen, whether you can pro|nounce him innocent of the crime of Sedition. Gentlemen, I own at the &s;ame time that this Pannel &s;hews a good deal of ingenuity, though I cannot applaud his di&s;cretion or judgment. The crime charged is Sedition: and I think he took up four hours in a defence, which was &s;edition from beginning to the end; finding fault with the Con&s;titution, and I think a &s;peech of a very &s;editious tendency, and I will not trouble you with any more of it. I have given you the general idea of the ca&s;e; if you are of opi|nion nothing is proved again&s;t this Gentleman, find him not guilty; on the other hand, if you think the facts and circum|&s;tances &s;ufficiently brought home again&s;t him, you will find him guilty.</P>

<P>Gentlemen, you have pronounced a very accurate verdict. This is a trial of great importance, and the country is obliged to you for the attention you have paid to the cau&s;e. If you have any thing to &s;ay, Mr. Margarot, now is the time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Margarot.</SPEAKER>
<P> Undoubtedly I have, my Lord. I did not ye&s;|terday &s;tart objections on futile grounds. I objected to the competency of the Court; I object to it at pre&s;ent; I informed
<PB N="156" REF="027594_0156_0FD54E2700215340">
your Lord&s;hips, that I meant to bring an appeal again&s;t the whole procedure, in con&s;equence of that incompetency. You thought proper, at that time, to repel my objection, but I now &s;till &s;u&s;tain it: it is in con&s;equence of the ab&s;ence of the Lord Ju&s;tice General of Scotland; I was charged to appear before him: he does not appear in his place; I did my duty, he neglect|ed his, and the Court was not full; and it certainly was nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould attend, otherwi&s;e the Indictment would have run, the Lord Ju&s;tice General, the Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk <HI>or</HI> the other Lords; in&s;tead of which, it ran, <HI>and</HI> the other Lords of Ju&s;ti|ciary: That implies the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity that he &s;hould be in his place; or otherwi&s;e, the Court was not even by the Public Pro&s;ecutor deemed complete. I likewi&s;e mean to bring an ob|jection, full as forcible, which is that which I experienced in the cour&s;e of my trial. I was not able, though I had performed all the nece&s;&s;ary legal ceremonies, I was not able (becau&s;e &s;ome men do not pay that re&s;pect to the laws which they ought to do) to adduce &s;everal of my exculpatory witne&s;&s;es: your Lord&s;hips refu&s;ed to grant me a caption; your Lord&s;hips' refu&s;ed to grant me delay; con&s;equently, the mo&s;t material evidences, that I could have brought in my own defence, were entirely denied me: but, my Lord, although that denial was in con&s;equence of an a&s;&s;ertion of this Court, that your Juri&s;diction did not extend to England; yet, a part of my Indictment was &s;ounded on crimes &s;aid to be committed in England, and relative to the people of England. It is odd, that you &s;hould take cognizance, in this Court, of crimes relative to the people of England, when from England you cannot compel the attendance of a &s;ingle witne&s;s in my favour.</P>
<P>There is, my Lord, an objection again, which is entirely local, which is confined to Edinburgh it&s;elf: I have &s;ummoned, three men, as exculpatory evidences; two of them were at|tending, the third was not attending; but no notice was taken of him. The&s;e men I wi&s;h to call into Court, to examine as exculpatory evidences for me. The Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk in&s;i&s;ted upon my telling the nature of the que&s;tions I intended to put: I gave him the outlines of them, upon which he thought pro|per to refu&s;e the admi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e evidences.</P>
<P>Another charge relates to your&s;elf: I had ordered the me&s;|&s;enger to &s;ummon your Lord&s;hip upon certain facts, which went to prove, that it was very likely I had already, before my trial, been prejudged. Your Lord&s;hip was not &s;ummoned, in con&s;e|quence of the fear of this man offending a per&s;on in power, but, at the beginning of the trial, your Lord&s;hip told me, and the Public Pro&s;ecutor, to his ju&s;tice be it &s;aid, acknowledged that the legal point &s;hould be obviated, and that you &s;hould attend as an exculpatory evidence; but when it came to the point, you refu&s;ed to be put upon your oath, and to an&s;wer the que&s;tions propo&s;ed to you. Tho&s;e que&s;tions went to criminate your&s;elf, my
<PB N="157" REF="027594_0157_0FD54E2847A7BF50">
Lord; they remain unan&s;wered, by the advice of your brother Judges. The con&s;equence was, that my defence was neither &s;o complete, my exculpatory evidence not &s;o &s;atisfactory, and I make no doubt but that it is owing to that that the Jury, of whom I &s;hall take no notice at pre&s;ent; that is the bu&s;ine&s;s of their country, not of me; that the Jury have thought proper to find me guilty. There is another thing, &s;hould the&s;e objec|tions be repelled; I have another to bring forward, that will not &s;o ea&s;ily be got rid of. It &s;eems to be the cu&s;tom of Scotland, that the witne&s;&s;es are confined to a chamber by them&s;elves, and no &s;tranger admitted among&s;t them; that was not the ca&s;e ye&s;|terday; a per&s;on, of the name of James Carli&s;le, was conver&s;ing with them a con&s;iderable time in the outer hou&s;e. The&s;e are great objections for &s;taying judgment. The two fir&s;t objections go to cancel the whole proceedings, and the three la&s;t at lea&s;t to &s;taying of judgment. I have no more &s;ay at pre&s;ent.</P>

<P> My Lords, this Pannel has &s;tated the very &s;ame objections that he &s;tated ye&s;terday, except one, which &s;tates that there were &s;trangers with the witne&s;&s;es in the other room; and, if it was &s;o, the officer who had the charge of them may be culpable and puni&s;hable; becau&s;e it is contrary to the cu&s;tom of the Court: but, my Lords, to &s;ay that it &s;hall annul a verdict, or &s;tay judgment, does not appear to me to be at all the practice. It is impo&s;&s;ible for the Court but to proceed upon the verdict, and I mu&s;t give my opinion upon this head, that it is not a valid objection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord E&s;kgrove.</SPEAKER>
<P> My Lords, The Pannel now at the Bar had more indulgence than the Court ever gave a Pannel before, be|cau&s;e he was a &s;tranger. My Lords, I cannot help taking no|tice of an in&s;inuation, on the part of the Pannel, to the Court by threats of impeachment, and threats of being brought upon our knees, or &s;uffering the pains of death. I am happy the Pannel has not thought fit to renew that language to day; yet I would not fit altogether upon this trial, without &s;ignifying my opinion, that if it had not been, that we held in contempt in&s;i|nuations of threats to us, that are illegal; &s;o, on the other hand, we will &s;ubmit to every appeal that is competent, if there is any &s;uperior authority, we will readily &s;ubmit to their deci&s;ions. But, my Lords, it is not for this man, or any man, to think to terrify this Country into a &s;ubver&s;ion of ju&s;tice. Had he been
<PB N="158" REF="027594_0158_0FD7BFE2EEE700F8">
a native of this country, he would not have been &s;uffered to go on as he did. I approve of his conduct to-day, which is more temperate; but, for the &s;ake of others who might be here ye&s;|terday, and &s;ome who may hear of it, I will &s;ay, that it is not the right of any pri&s;oner to go out of his defence, and attack the Court, who are able to defend them&s;elves when the attack is made. I was of opinion, with my Brothers, upon the objec|tions ye&s;terday, and therefore it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould not be of the &s;ame opinion to-day, unle&s;s &s;omething new had been urged. The objection as to the Lord Ju&s;tice General was fully an&s;wered ye&s;terday, and does not de&s;erve any notice; as to the que&s;tions put to your Lord&s;hip not being an&s;wered, it was not becau&s;e of your being a Judge in this Court, but becau&s;e of their being irrelevant to his defence. As to his objection of a &s;tranger being admitted with the witne&s;&s;es, I am &s;orry that any &s;uch thing &s;hould happen. He may have been &s;ent from either party, or he might have no connection with any party; but it is a &s;trange thing to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch an accident &s;hould make null and void all the proceedings of this Court again&s;t this Pan|nel; and I am the more &s;urprized at that objection being made, on account of his being a native of England, where he mu&s;t well know that it is the general practice that the witne&s;&s;es are not at all inclo&s;ed, but they are in Court during the time of the trial. Not but we allow that it is &s;ometimes ordered otherwi&s;e by the Court, and in this ca&s;e it &s;eems to have been by accident. It does not appear at all that he was tampering with the witne&s;&s;es; and therefore no blame lies upon the Court, and it is needle&s;s to &s;eek any redre&s;s in the way in which it has this day been done from this Court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Swinton.</SPEAKER>
<P> My Lords, The only new objection is, that a per&s;on of the name of Carli&s;le was admitted among the witne&s;&s;es; if that was valid, the objection is now too late; it ought to have been made when they were brought to be examined. My Lord, every witne&s;s, in a mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, was &s;worn and a&s;ked upon oath, whether he was in&s;tructed or taught as to the evi|dence he was to give, and an an&s;wer was made by every witne&s;s upon oath, that he was not; and therefore, if there was any thing in the objection, it was done away by that; and there|fore it is my opinion, that it &s;hould be repelled.</P>

He mu&s;t be convinced that he has had a fair trial; he went on for four hours in his defence; he is a &s;tranger in this

country, and not having coun&s;el, we allowed him to go on in a manner in which we would not have permitted a native of Scot|land; he went on for four hours in &s;uch a way as was contrary to the Con&s;titution of the country, and your Lord&s;hip will now proceed in giving your opinion upon what &s;hall be the re&s;ult of this verdict.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Henderland.</SPEAKER>
<P> My Lords, The Jury having di&s;charged their duty to their country, by a patient hearing of this trial, after, I am per&s;uaded, a full con&s;ideration of the evidence, it re|mains for the Court to con&s;ider what may be an adequate puni&s;h|ment of the crime he &s;tands charged with. My Lords, the crime of which he has been found guilty is &s;edition, and it is detailed in the minor propo&s;ition, taking an active and di&s;tingui&s;hed part in the deliberations and proceedings of a &s;ociety, who&s;e meet|ings were held under pretence of procuring a Reform in Parlia|ment, but which were of a dangerous and de&s;tructive tendency, with a determined intention to di&s;turb the peace of the commu|nity, and to &s;ubvert the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution of the Country. My Lords, it is a mo&s;t dangerous crime, and mo&s;t exten&s;ive indeed in its con&s;equences.&mdash;It appears in evidence that this was a Conven|tion, forming them&s;elves into a Society, calling them&s;elves Citi|zens, Sections, Committees. In &s;hort, a&s;&s;uming the form of a French Parliament, thereby &s;hewing that they wi&s;hed proceed|ings to take place here of a &s;imilar nature to tho&s;e of France. My Lords, I fear not the &s;word of the enemy, or the poignard of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, while &s;itting in my place, di&s;charging the &s;acred office of a Judge. I &s;hall give my opinion as it &s;trikes my feel|ings; I &s;hall give my &s;entiments, as they appear to me to be &s;up|ported by Law. This charge is that of active Sedition; and the di&s;tinction between this charge, and that of lea&s;ing making, is an imperfect one; for it is to demon&s;tration capable of being proved, that, before the union, there did exi&s;t Sedition, com|mitted by words in fal&s;e argument, by attacks upon the Con&s;ti|tution, and upon the legi&s;lative bodies of the Con&s;titution. It can be demon&s;trated by the records of this Court, that there was a common law &s;edition, different from lea&s;ing making; and upon which this Court held it&s;elf competent to found a libel; to infer an arbitrary puni&s;hment. Therefore, in whatever point of view I take the charge again&s;t this man, (though I think it amounts to active Sedition), I have no doubt that this Court has power to puni&s;h it, by the highe&s;t arbitrary puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>My Lords, I doubt not that what I now &s;ay will be made pub|lic: I ob&s;erve that it is fal&s;ely &s;et forth, in one edition of a late trial, that I &s;aid, it wrung my heart to mention the crime of Se|dition. I am in the judgment of your Lord&s;hips, and every man who heard me, I &s;aid no &s;uch thing&mdash;I &s;aid, it wrung my heart (and I own that it did) to &s;ee a Gentleman, a young Gentleman, who had received a Gentleman's education and who had di&s;co|vered abilities not incon&s;iderable, &s;hould be the object of &s;uch puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="027594_0160_0FD54E2E21E3B860">My Lords, this Gentleman is a &s;tranger, and &s;orry I am that he &s;hould have come into this country. I regret, as I mu&s;t do, the con&s;equences it has had, and the conduct that he has a&s;&s;um|ed. It now becomes my duty, as a Judge, to &s;ay what &s;ort of puni&s;hment this crime de&s;erves; and, my Lords, I know no other way in which I could di&s;charge my duty to God, to my country, and to my own con&s;cience, but by propo&s;ing to your Lord&s;hips, that this man &s;hould be bani&s;hed forth of this kingdom by tran&s;|portation; or, in common language, &s;hould be tran&s;ported to &s;uch part of his Maje&s;ty's Dominions, as his Maje&s;ty, in Council, &s;hall plea&s;e to appoint; and there to remain for the &s;pace of 14 years, under pain and penalty of death, in ca&s;e of return.&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord E&s;kgrove.</SPEAKER>
<P> My Lords, the Pannel has been found, by the verdict of a Jury of his country, guilty of the facts charged a|gain&s;t him. My Lords, we ye&s;terday gave our opinions upon the validity of the Indictment, all, in one voice, finding that Se|dition was a high crime, by the laws of Scotland. Your Lord|&s;hips were al&s;o opinion, that the facts charged and alleged by the Public Pro&s;ecutor, in the minor propo&s;ition, amount|ed to the crime of Sedition. I will not now repeat, what has been well ob&s;erved by my Lord Henderland, who has gone be|fore me, as to the grounds of that opinion. My Lords, as the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent &s;tands, I am &s;orry this Gentleman &s;hould have been guilty of &s;uch a crime; but a Jury of his country have found that he is guilty of the charges in this Indictment; and there|fore I in no way differ from your Lord&s;hip in thinking, that the Jury have di&s;charged a duty to their country: but, if I had been of another opinion, my duty would have been one and the &s;ame, which is to pronounce the &s;entence of the law upon the per&s;on found guilty, by his country, of the crime charged, and carrying it into execution, by a puni&s;hment &s;uitable to the of|fence. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to go through the circum&s;tances of this Indictment, upon all of which the Jury have returned a verdict, finding the Pri&s;oner guilty. My Lords, it may amount to the finding him guilty of leading, as well as a&s;&s;i&s;ting, a number of people, &s;tyling them&s;elves a &s;ort of Parliament in this country, for the purpo&s;e, as I &s;tated ye&s;terday, of &s;ubverting the Con&s;ti|tution of the country; and then there is a more &s;pecific enume|ration of facts: it &s;ets forth, that they were to &s;et at defi|ance the authority of the legi&s;lature; that even if an act was moved for, di&s;agreeable to them, they were to meet in a &s;ecret Convention; they thought fit to be concealed, in order to delibe|rate upon what was to be done; they were, likewi&s;e to do the &s;ame, if there was an inva&s;ion: and what inva&s;ion is to be feared at this time, I leave to the judgment of every one who hears me. Al&s;o, in ca&s;e of the landing of foreign troops, for the &s;upport of the government of the country, that was to be the cau&s;e of the &s;udden meeting of this Convention: Al&s;o, if the Habeas Cor|pus Act was repealed: And la&s;tly, if any interruption was
<PB N="161" REF="027594_0161_0FD54E2FA075E7F0">
given to their meetings this Convention of Emergency was to &s;it. What conclu&s;ion can be drawn from &s;uch language; but that they meant to &s;ubvert the Con&s;titution of the country; that it was meant to be carried on in a &s;tyle of defiance and oppo&s;ition to the legi&s;lative authority of this country? therefore, it is in vain for any per&s;on, pretending to know any thing of the Law of Scotland, to &s;ay this is merely lea&s;ing making. I &s;hall only &s;ay, that it would have been difficult, if it had not been for the alte|ration of the &s;tatute law, to know whether it would not have amounted to the crime of high trea&s;on. My Lords, the Jury have found this man guilty: he is an Engli&s;hman. I am &s;orry that any of that country &s;hould ever have interfered in the peace and tranquility, either of their own country, or of this which is a part of the united Kingdoms; but I think we cannot pronounce a le&s;s &s;entence, in this ca&s;e, than in the former ca&s;es; and if any difference is to be made, I do not think it is in favour of this Defendant, who, in his own country, might have lived peacea|bly and quietly. My Lords, there can be no &s;ort of doubt with regard to the powers of the Court: By the laws of this country, before the Act of 1708, Bani&s;hment from the realm of Scotland was one thing, and Bani&s;hment to a place beyond the &s;eas was another; and the&s;e were as well known at that time as at this. But, my Lords, is it proper that a per&s;on from England being found guilty of attempts to &s;ubvert the Con&s;titution; is it rea|&s;onable that we &s;hould return him to England, in order that he may continue his practices there, if &s;o inclined? If we were not able to do more, we could not help it; but, I &s;ay, the power of bani&s;hment, by tran&s;portation, has been long recognized in Scot|land, as well as in England. The Court can do no le&s;s, than make u&s;e of the power which the law gives them, to &s;end him to a place where he can do no harm. My Lords, if I had any doubt about it, your judgment in the ca&s;e of Mr. Muir, where I was not pre&s;ent, but where the other Judges uniformly gave their opinion, that this mode of bani&s;hment, by tran&s;portation, was the proper puni&s;hment for &s;uch an offence; that would be &s;ufficient for me to concur in the &s;ame opinion. If that puni&s;h|ment was not too much for Skirving, the Secretary to this Con|vention, who appears to be a &s;imple deluded man, it cannot be too much for this gentleman, who is, &s;o far as I can judge, a man of abilities, of con&s;iderable knowledge, and one who took the lead in this Convention; and therefore, I concur in the puni&s;h|ment mentioned by your Lord&s;hip.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Swinton.</SPEAKER>
<P> My Lords, I have no difficulty in concurring with your Lord&s;hips in the puni&s;hment you have &s;ugge&s;ted; and, after what has been &s;aid by your Lord&s;hips, I &s;hall only take no|tice of a very few things; My Lords, the crime of &s;edition is wor&s;e in one re&s;pect than mo&s;t other crimes: many other crimes are committed from the &s;udden impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, or heat; but this crime is committed with a premeditated, felonious intention,
<PB N="162" REF="027594_0162_0FD54E31261E25F0">
by deliberating upon the means of overturning our Con&s;titution. They begin with &s;editious and inflammatory di&s;cour&s;es, endea|vouring to draw &s;imple, and perhaps well meaning, people after them, by pointing out imperfections which will be in every go|vernment whatever, and placing them in a &s;trong light; and, in the next place, by &s;editious writings. My Lords, in this ca&s;e the delegates meet, and they appoint a Convention of Emergency; and what are the&s;e Conventions of Emergency? fir&s;t of all, for the purpo&s;e of over-awing Parliament; and one of their re&s;o|lutions is, to pay no regard to &s;uch an act of Parliament if it &s;hould pa&s;s: that is, they de&s;pi&s;e the legi&s;lative authority of the country. Then, in the ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion, and it is ea&s;y to &s;ee what &s;ort of an inva&s;ion was meant. I decline going through all the other particulars of this libel, which is found to be a true li|bel in every point. My Lords, what have they pretended? They have pretended a reformation in the Con&s;titution. I &s;ay, my Lords, there is no need for it; our Con&s;titution reforms it|&s;elf. With regard to trial by Jury, which is the palladium, in my memory three acts have been brought in for reforming this point: one lately, giving Juries a power to decide upon the whole matter, in ca&s;e of libel; and we have no need of &s;uch Reformers as the&s;e.</P>
<P>My Lords, if there is any difference between this ca&s;e and that of others, the crime of this man is highly aggravated: he is not of this country; he does not feel any hard&s;hips from the govern|ment of this country; he comes from England, for &s;editious purpo&s;es, as &s;tated in this Indictment; and therefore, if there is any di&s;tinction in this ca&s;e, it is unfavourable to this Pannel. I am of opinion, with your Lord&s;hips, that tran&s;portation for fourteen years is the proper puni&s;hment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Dun&s;innan.</SPEAKER>
<P> My Lords, after the mo&s;t patient hearing of this ca&s;e, by a Jury, they have come to that determination which &s;en&s;ible, hone&s;t men alone could come to: namely, finding this Pannel guilty. There is no doubt but he has been &s;ent into this country, in order to di&s;&s;eminate &s;edition; and, it is evident, that he was very &s;edulous in the execution of that office. The Jury, having found a verdict of guilty, it comes to the Court to con&s;ider what puni&s;hment this crime de&s;erves; and, my Lords, though it is not plea&s;ant to pa&s;s judgment upon a fellow &s;ubject, crimes, dangerous as the&s;e, cannot be overlooked. My Lords, I am of opinion that this man's guilt is aggravated beyond that of others, who have been in the &s;ame circum&s;tances; and that tran&s;|portation for fourteen years is the proper puni&s;hment.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Abercrombie.</SPEAKER>
<P> My Lords, it has been ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that, during the cour&s;e of the trial, the Pannel, now at the bar, met with an uncommon &s;hare of indulgence: I believe far beyond what any Court of Ju&s;tice, either in this or any other country, ever afforded a Pannel. My Lords, I don't feel, and never &s;hall feel my&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ay one word to load any man, who &s;tands
<PB N="163" REF="027594_0163_0FD54E32A8207DD0">
in the unhappy &s;ituation that he does; but I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve, that from the moment he appeared at the bar, till the in&s;tant he was carried out, his whole conduct was of the mo&s;t indecent kind. My Lords, the crime with which he &s;tands charged, and of which he is found guilty, by the unanimous voice of his coun|try, upon the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory evidence, is that of Sedition, and my Lords, his crime is highly aggravated by one circum&s;tance, which appeared in the cour&s;e of the trial, that he has been &s;tir|ring up Sedition in this country, and in&s;tigating &s;uch unhappy men, as you &s;aw here ye&s;terday; for example, one of the Mem|bers of the Briti&s;h Convention, who was &s;o ignorant of the Con|&s;titution of his own country, that he was obliged to admit, that he never &s;o much as read the Claim of Rights. My Lords, is it to &s;uch men as the&s;e that we are to re&s;ort, to get a redre&s;s of the grievances of this country?</P>
<P>My Lords, if we are to judge of the means he made u&s;e of from his &s;peeches in the minutes of the Convention, and the &s;peech which we heard la&s;t night, &s;ure I am, that his intention was, to &s;tir up a &s;pirit of di&s;affection and di&s;content among the ignorant and the uninformed; and, my Lords, I con&s;ider the circum&s;tance of this Pannel being a &s;tranger to this country as an aggravation of his crime.</P>
<P>My Lords, this Society called them&s;elves originally the friends of the people; they afterwards changed their name, calling them&s;elves the Briti&s;h Convention of Delegates, a&s;&s;ociated to ob|tain univer&s;al &s;uffrage and annual Parliaments; a right which the &s;ubjects of this country never did enjoy: &s;uch a right would tend to bring ruin and de&s;truction upon this country. I &s;ay my Lords, that to this man, they owed that change, and that form which they a&s;&s;umed, and of which we have heard &s;o much.</P>
<P>My Lords, I &s;hall only add, that the puni&s;hment propo&s;ed is the milde&s;t, which, under all the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, ought to be pronounced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P> My Lords, after the full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion which this crime has undergone, within the&s;e three months, I &s;hall only ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that the crime of which this Pannel is accu&s;ed, and now &s;tands convicted by the verdict of a mo&s;t re&s;pectable Jury of this Country, is Sedition; endeavouring to overturn the e&s;tabli&s;hed government of this Country, which is, of all crimes known among&s;t mankind, of the mo&s;t heinous nature and the mo&s;t dangerous tendency to Society, and well merits the highe&s;t arbitrary puni&s;hment that this Court can po&s;&s;ibly inflict. You have had two trials before you, one within the&s;e few months, in which the Pannel was condemned to tran&s;portation for 14 years, and the other you condemned within the&s;e few days for the &s;ame term. The moment I heard the verdict I revolved in my own mind the circum&s;tances attending this ca&s;e; but it is impo&s;&s;ible that we can, agreeable to the ju&s;tice of the Country, inflict a le&s;s puni&s;hment; the only doubt that occurred to me was, whether
<PB N="164" REF="027594_0164_0FD54E34229D2908">
we ought not to go further; for I did &s;ee a material difference; this ca&s;e being attended with circum&s;tances highly aggravated and offen&s;ive to the Laws of this country.</P>
<P>If this Country &s;uffers any grievances, I am &s;ure he felt none of them: he lives not in Scotland, has no property there, and, as a &s;tranger, he comes into this Country a man with a great deal of abilities and great elocution, he comes here for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of di&s;&s;eminating Sedition among the lower order of peo|ple, in this Country. I cannot con&s;ider it as any thing but Sedi|tion highly aggravated. I did think that this crime de&s;erved a more &s;evere puni&s;hment; but I have always more plea&s;ure in in|flicting a mild puni&s;hment than a more &s;evere one: and as your Lord&s;hips are all of opinion, that we &s;hould inflict the &s;ame pu|ni&s;hment as in the ca&s;e of Skirving and Muir, I concur in the &s;ame opinion, that he &s;hall be tran&s;ported for the term of 14 years, with the u&s;ual certification.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU de&s;ire me to give you my opinion of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of want and di&s;tre&s;s among the weavers in Spitalfields, being Phy&s;i|cian to the London Di&s;pen&s;ary, where between two and 3000 of them annually apply for medical relief, I am called frequently to vi&s;it their wretched habitations, there the fir&s;t thing that com|monly pre&s;ents it&s;elf to view, is an empty loom, and a &s;tarving family. Some have had only half their u&s;ual work, for more than twelvemonths pa&s;t; and many no work at all, for the la&s;t &s;ix months. Some times I find one or two children &s;ick, and the wretched Parents looking upon them with all the di&s;tre&s;s which parental affection, and the utmo&s;t degree of poverty, can impre&s;s on the mind. At other times, I find the hu&s;band and wife, and not unfrequently both &s;ick in the &s;ame bed, and &s;everal helple&s;s and half &s;tarved children looking up to them for bread. Here anxiety and poverty increa&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e if they did not produce it, which however is often the ca&s;e. It is impo&s;&s;ible for words to give a perfect idea of the di&s;tre&s;s which prevails among&s;t this u&s;eful cla&s;s of the people. If any doubt the truth of this repre|&s;entation, all I can &s;ay is, come and &s;ee. Were they to accom|pany me in my daily vi&s;itations for a &s;hort time, they would be fully convinced, that this is a very imperfect outline of the ge|neral mi&s;ery among&s;t this part of the labouring poor, who would gladly work, if they could be employed; and therefore the more de&s;erving of help. I am per&s;uaded, Sir, that you need only be ac|quainted with real di&s;tre&s;s, to intere&s;t your&s;elf in the means of relieving it in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. Both you, Sir, and tho&s;e who &s;econd your laudable endeavours and benevolent purpo&s;es, will be doing a good work. I am,</P>

<P>In one &s;hort month (December 1792) an innovation was made on the &s;cheme of Briti&s;h Society; and, in one eventful year, it has changed the character of the nation, from the happy con|dition of a people living together like one large family, under common laws; we were broke into &s;ets, and put under the inqui|&s;ition of Clubs. Jealou&s;y and Di&s;cord &s;ucceeded confidence and Union; the mo&s;t honourable connections; the mo&s;t ancient friend&s;hips; the &s;ocial and endearing intercour&s;es of neigh|bourhood; nay, the ties of kindred were rudely, wantonly torn a&s;under; and the better to &s;ecure to us the calamities of a foreign war, we were involved in the more dreadful horrors of internal feud. In the &s;hort &s;pace that we can allot to this article, it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to enter into the painful enumeration of the events of 1792. When the faithful hi&s;torian comes to record them after pa&s;&s;ion and tremor have &s;ub&s;ided, it will be found to be the mo&s;t di&s;a&s;trous to con&s;titutional liberty, to &s;cience, to mo|rals, and to trade, that England ever knew, &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment if its freedom. What a rever&s;e from the animating and cheering picture of our pro&s;perity and happine&s;s, which a libe|ral Corre&s;pondent gave to the public, through the medium of this paper, on this day twelvemonth. The great events of the year have covered with di&s;tre&s;s the whole face of the i&s;land; the &s;ecret hi&s;tory of the period we neither fully can nor dare de|velope. It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that acts of per&s;ecution, unknown to Engli&s;hmen, have been practi&s;ed with applau&s;e; integrity and friend&s;hip have been branded as unbecoming an exalted mind; and con&s;i&s;tency in principles as un&s;uitable to the times. Opi|nion has been hunted into the retirement of families, and he who dared to manife&s;t his public doctrines, has been a&s;&s;aulted on the &s;ide of his profe&s;&s;ion in life. The pulpit, the army, the bar, and the pre&s;s, all furni&s;h the &s;hocking evidence that Spani&s;h and Italian arts may flouri&s;h on an Engli&s;h &s;oil.</P>
