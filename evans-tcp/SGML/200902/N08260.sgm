<P>IT is &s;ome years &s;ince I received the fir&s;t of the&s;e letters from a friend: &s;ince which I have been frequently &s;olliciting him to con&s;ent to their being made publick, and have very late|ly by his &s;econd letter prevailed with him.</P>
<P>The Subject is &s;o intere&s;ting to mankind in General, that the candid reader I tru&s;t will ex|cu&s;e any Apology for my offering them to his impartial con&s;ideration. It is very &s;urprizing &s;ays a late ingenious French Author, "that the Greeks and Romans, with &s;o much knowledge and humanity had &s;laves like the Barbarians, in|&s;tead of Dome&s;tics; it is &s;till more &s;urprizing, perhaps, that chri&s;tian nations with the Go&s;pel before their Eyes, &s;hould condemn their brethren in the colonies to all the horrors of &s;lavery, be|cau&s;e they are <HI>black.</HI> The fir&s;t man, who &s;aid to another, <HI>you &s;hall be my &s;lave, for I am &s;tronger than you;</HI> mu&s;t have had the heart of a Tyger.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Under&s;tand you have thoughts of being concern|ed in the African &s;lave-trade. My regard to the welfare of all mankind, and particular affection for you, leads me at this time to write you my &s;entiments upon Slavery, and the <HI>&s;lave-trade.</HI>&mdash; And I doubt not but you will excu&s;e my thus med|dling in your bu&s;ine&s;s, when you con&s;ider I have no private ends to an&s;wer. If what I &s;hall offer upon the &s;ubject, &s;hould be thought of no weight, it will only in|terrupt you a few minutes; but if I &s;hould be &s;o hap|py as to convince you, that however profitable the trade may be to &s;ome adventurers, yet that it is contrary to humanity, chri&s;tianity, the intere&s;t of the province, and of private families, I &s;hall not only be &s;ure of your de|&s;i&s;ting from &s;o vile a trade, but have great hopes, that your example and influence in this place, will, in time, produce an act of government to prevent the further

importation of &s;laves among us; and I can flatter my|&s;elf, that the example of this province may influence others; but if not, we can be gloriou&s;ly &s;ingle.</P>
<P>Great-Britain, the envy of the world, does not per|mit a &s;lave on her happy i&s;land; but gives to every one freedom, which &s;tamps him image of his God.</P>
<P>Before I enter upon the arguments for and again&s;t the trade, permit me to contra&s;t a Briton and a negro &s;lave in America, neither chargeable with any crime cognizable by the public&mdash;A Briton has the free di&s;po|&s;al of his time, to employ it in that way he likes be&s;t; all he gains by his indu&s;try, he hath &s;ole right to; none of it can be taken from him, but by his con&s;ent; he may marry, no man can &s;eperate him from the ob|ject of his affections; his hou&s;e is his ca&s;tle; none (un|le&s;s he has made him&s;elf obnoxious to the public) may intrude upon him. Happy Briton! The &s;lave has neither command of his time, nor choice of his em|ploy; mu&s;t labour ince&s;&s;antly during his ma&s;ter's plea&s;ure; can make no claim to the produce of his own indu&s;try; a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tance is all he receives; and tho' he has labour'd 20 years, and earn'd his ma&s;ter an e&s;tate, yet even then he is liable to be &s;old, and of|ten is, for want of employ, or for fear that in his old age he &s;hould be a burthen upon the wealthy heirs. He can't marry, becau&s;e marriage is founded on <HI>promi&s;e,</HI> and &s;laves can promi&s;e nothing. They are indeed, &s;ometimes, to plea&s;e them, indulged a &s;ham-marriage, which is di&s;&s;olved again at the ma&s;ter's will, without con&s;ulting the &s;laves' inclination. He is &s;old out of the country, and &s;o &s;hifted from hand to hand (if he lives to be old) 'till he is a burthen, and wi&s;hed out of life to &s;ave expence. Shocking contra&s;t! Whatever ends a wi&s;e God may have in permitting &s;uch various

fortunes to the children of men, yet &s;urely no man can be ju&s;tified in being in&s;trumental of &s;uch hard fate to any of his <HI>fellow creatures.</HI></P>
<P>Humanity makes us feel for the evils we know any of our &s;pecies labour under; and unle&s;s hardened by education or cu&s;tom, we naturally re&s;ent the pain or hard&s;hips of others; e&s;pecially, when we &s;ee them im|po&s;ed on <HI>innocence</HI> by the hand of oppre&s;&s;ion, which is certainly the ca&s;e of all tho&s;e poor children, who are dragg'd from their mother's arms, and never ta&s;te the &s;weets of liberty.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have thought none but the harden'd wretch could have entertained a thought of planning a voyage to Africa with de&s;ign to bring off its inhabi|tants, and <HI>cur&s;e</HI> them with perpetual &s;lavery; even &s;uppo&s;ing they were in &s;ome &s;ort our enemies; but how is it aggravated when we know that the Africans are an harmle&s;s people, having never gone beyond their own bounds, to trouble mankind; and but for the in|terruption from white people might enjoy all the &s;weets of a rural life; being ble&s;s'd with a fine fruitful &s;oil, which yields with &s;mall labour all the nece&s;&s;aries of life. This is the people who by &s;ome &s;trange fatality are pitched upon by the Europeans for &s;laves; and how are they made &s;uch? not by giving an open chal|lenge to fight them that the captivated on either &s;ide may expect to be en&s;laved; this would have the appearance of heroi&s;m. No! but the ba&s;e&s;t means are u&s;ed to accom|pli&s;h the ba&s;e&s;t end. It is well known we have been above a century pa&s;t crouding our luxuries upon the Africans; and when the gold du&s;t of their land could not &s;atisfy us, they were tempted to &s;ell their brethren, to purcha&s;e our intoxicating liquors and childi&s;h toys; thus we impo&s;ed upon their weakne&s;s, and encouraged

their barbarity by appearing ready purcha&s;ers of their people for perpetual &s;laves: This trade for the lives of men being once e&s;tabli&s;hed, has &s;et all Africa by the ears; all hone&s;t indu&s;try among them is laid a&s;ide for the more profitable bu&s;ine&s;s of trapaning one ano|ther; all common confidence is de&s;troyed; and indeed their natural affections are very much weaken'd by their immoderate fondne&s;s for our luxuries <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chambers's Dictionary ob&s;erves, that it is frequent for a &s;on to &s;ell his father and mother; and parents their chil|dren, for a few bottles of Brandy, and a bar <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE>&mdash;Pray Sir, is not this inhumane in us?&mdash;But further, I find by the accounts of that trade, that when a powerful black Prince has collected by force or artifice a num|ber of his colour, they are offer'd to the whites for &s;ale; then an in&s;pector, perhaps a phy&s;ician, is em|ploy'd by the purcha&s;ers to view the &s;laves, who are &s;tripped of every rag which mode&s;ty had procured, ana male and female handled in a manner not to be related, to &s;elect the &s;ound in wind and limb: in their choice they pay no regard to former connections, hu&s;|band and wife are parted, parents and children are &s;e|perated, the weakly wife will not be taken to accom|pany the healthy husband. Oh! methinks I hear their &s;creeches, rending the very Heavens, when the&s;e horrid &s;cenes take place! the <HI>unhappy healthy</HI> are im|mediately hand-tied, and then two and two are yoked by their necks like hor&s;es for &s;hipping, and drove in herds by their ma&s;ters to the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and &s;tow'd in the hold of a ve&s;&s;el: Owners are &s;o greedy of a large freight that they croud the negroes in &s;uch numbers and under &s;uch clo&s;e confinement lea&s;t they &s;hould ri&s;e, as renders their pa&s;&s;age almo&s;t intolerable. Upon a moderate computation it is reckon'd that 10, or 12,000 die yearly on their pa&s;&s;age, and, in &s;ea&s;oning, either

in the &s;ickly i&s;lands or in the cold climates, tho&s;e that &s;ur|vive are fix'd for life to their de&s;tined &s;lavery&mdash;It is well known that the greate&s;t number by far of the&s;e mi&s;e|rable creatures, are fix'd on the We&s;t India i&s;lands, where their fate in general is &s;o extremely hard as to &s;hock a humane tongue to relate or a humane ear to hear.&mdash;Tho' they &s;pend 6 days in 7, in unremitted la|bour for their ma&s;ters, con&s;tantly over-looked, by cruel drivers, yet the ma&s;ter does not think him&s;elf obliged to provide food for his &s;laves; indeed he allows them Sundays to till a &s;mall piece of land for them|&s;elves, and carry the produce to market, by which they &s;ub&s;i&s;t&mdash;If one day's labour in a week is &s;ufficient to &s;up|port a man and his children, how exce&s;&s;ive hard is it to be obliged to work the other &s;ix, for tho&s;e whom they mu&s;t hate? I need not relate any particulars of the unbounded whippings which they are expo&s;ed to, and commonly experience upon every &s;light offence. The lea&s;t oppo&s;ition di&s;cover'd in them, or attempt to free them&s;elves from their mi&s;erable &s;tate is &s;ure and certain death, and that with all the aggravation that cruelty can invent, &s;uch as &s;tarving to death in the mid&s;t of plenty, in which &s;tate I have heard Gentlemen &s;ay, they live in a cage from 7 to 9 days. Oh! horrid! Pray Sir con&s;ider, is it for any moral evil that this part of our fellow men, are thus extremely tormented? Can the &s;tale and flim&s;y pretence that Africans u&s;ed to kill their captives before we appear'd to buy 'em, ju&s;tify the helli&s;h practice of the pre&s;ent day? even tho' it &s;hould be granted that that was the fate of &s;ome; for without all doubt a much greater number are now yearly de&s;troyed in the extra-wars occa&s;ioned by the demand for &s;laves.</P>
<P>The &s;hocking noi&s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, as mentioned above,

be&s;ides the &s;elf-murthers they are drove to by de&s;pair, &s;uch as &s;tarving, or &s;trangling them&s;elves, beating their brains again&s;t the &s;hip, or jumping over-board; the &s;ickly climates to which they are carry'd; the exce&s;&s;ive labor to which the greate&s;t part are drove, which we may well think va&s;tly &s;horten their days: for a &s;lave of 40 years is &s;carce worth owning When you take all the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances into con&s;ideration, I doubt not, Sir, but you'll be convinced that there are more lives lo&s;t now among the Africans yearly, than before the pre&s;ent practice of &s;lavery commenced; and that the Balance of mi&s;ery is va&s;tly increa&s;ed again&s;t them; and all this by us chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Nor do I think that the &s;candalous vindication which &s;ome have had the effrontery to offer, will &s;atisfy a lover of truth and ju&s;tice, viz. that but for the &s;lave-trade, the We&s;t-India i&s;lands could not be cultivated to &s;uch amazing profit, <HI>let them &s;ink then</HI>&mdash;Others have &s;aid, that if the &s;lave trade was prohibited, many gentlemen of immmen&s;e fortunes mu&s;t be ruin'd, <HI>let them, and beg.</HI> 'Tis more honourable to &s;eek a &s;up|port by begging than by theft, as every man does who lives by the forced labour and privation of the liberty of any of his fellow-creatures; and tho' many a palliative have been compounded by &s;ome, even of the right reverend clergy for the con&s;ciences of tho&s;e who have been troubled, in a &s;erious hour; yet I be|lieve they have been too mode&s;t to think them &s;uffi|cient cures for &s;uch malignant wounds. This leads me Sir, to addre&s;s you as a chri&s;tian, for &s;uch you ap|pear to be: and pray how can this practice be recon|ciled with the great law of charity, &s;o much applaud|ed by all, viz. <HI>Do to others, as ye would that they &s;hould do to you.</HI> I never found a man but was &s;tag|gered

at that &s;hort &s;entence, when apply'd to the pre|&s;ent &s;ubject. I know indeed the great advantages 'tis pretended &s;laves receive, by being brought from a land of heatheni&s;h darkne&s;s and idolatry, to a land highly favoured with the light of the glorious go&s;pel; and &s;o ble&s;s'd with the means of &s;alvation. But let tho&s;e that appea&s;e their con&s;ciences with this &s;pecious argument, con&s;ider fir&s;t, that we are not to do evil that good may come of it: and further, what a very &s;mall <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;uppo&s;e 9 out of 10 are carry'd to, and &s;pend their days in the We&s;t-Indies and Southern colonies, where they live in companies, and not in private families.</NOTE> propor|tion of the&s;e poor tran&s;ported &s;laves have the lea&s;t chance of being benefited by chri&s;tianity. For I take it, and doubt not you join me, that it is no breach of charity to &s;ay, that all tho&s;e Africans, which are carry'd to our We&s;t-India i&s;lands, are carried from a land of ignorance and innocence to a land of glaring wickedne&s;s, where they have con&s;tant examples of every vice, and where they are likely to be|come &s;even-fold more the children of &s;atan, than when in their native country.</P>
<P>And as to tho&s;e few who are called happy in being brought into the&s;e Northern Colonies, very little can be &s;aid of the advantages which they receive, or the im|provement they make of it, for from the be&s;t ob&s;er|vations that I have been able to make (and I have long thought on the &s;ubject) I don't believe there is one in Ten of tho&s;e that have had the be&s;t opportunity that know any more of the chri&s;tian religion, except the name, than their brethren now in Guinea; and of tho&s;e that do know &s;omething more than the heathen, how few have we rea&s;on to think are influenced by the mo|tives and principles of our holy religion.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="010546_0010_0F8068F2030FD040">I &s;hall next point you to a few pa&s;&s;ages of that BOOK, the injunctions of which we confe&s;s to be univer&s;ally binding upon all that know them.</P>
<P>The jews were &s;trictly forbid <HI>man-&s;tealing,</HI> as in Exod. 21.16. He that &s;tealeth a man and &s;elleth him, or if he be found in his hands, he &s;hall be &s;urely be put to <HI>death</HI>&mdash;I know that the Jews in their traditions con|fined this prohibition to their own nation; becau&s;e in Deuteronomy 24, &amp; 7. it is &s;aid, If any man be found &s;tealing any of <HI>his brethren,</HI> &amp;c. then that thief &s;hall die&mdash; but even according to their explanation, they held that the thief was obliged to re&s;tore the per&s;on &s;tolen, tho' a &s;tranger, to his liberty again.</P>
<P>But whatever di&s;tinctions the Jews made between them&s;elves and other nations, we know that the wall of partition has long &s;ince been taken down, and we are taught in the Go&s;pel to e&s;teem all men, our brethren e&s;pecially, tho&s;e who have not injured us in any re&s;pect, either as a nation or private per&s;on: of this we can not have the lea&s;t doubt, when we hear our Lord &s;aying on the Mount, <Q>Love your enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, do good to them that hate you, &amp;c. that ye may be the children of your Father which is in Heaven</Q>&mdash;If this be &s;cripture, or the word of God to mankind, and the en&s;laving a poor in|nocent People, in the method now practiced, be con|&s;i&s;tent therewith, I acknowledge all my ideas of the words are confounded, and the &s;criptures are wrote in an unknown language to me.</P>
<P>But if there &s;till remains any doubt in your mind whether the writers of the new te&s;tament had any re&s;|pect to the practice I am now condemning, plea&s;e to read St. Paul's fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy 1 Chap. 9th, and 10th Ver&s;es, in which <HI>men &s;tealing</HI> is placed in the mid&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="010546_0011_0F8068F30D24E610" MS="y">
of a very black catalogue of vices, viz. <Q>Profane, mur|therers of parents, whoremongers, <HI>men &s;tealers,</HI> lyers and perjured per&s;ons, &amp;c. all which are contrary to &s;ound doctrine according to the glorious Go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God.</Q>&mdash;How trifling mu&s;t be the excu&s;e, which &s;ome, who hold &s;laves, have made, viz. That they are not men &s;tealers, having bought them with their money: that they would not be concerned in the trade upon any account, but &s;eeing they are brought here, and will be &s;old to &s;omebody, they may as well buy as others, they will treat 'em as well or better. Oh! ye fools or knaves, for in one of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es I think you mu&s;t be ranked, Is rea&s;on to be blinded with &s;uch a thin veil? Is the mo&s;t valuable ble&s;&s;ing in life, <HI>liberty,</HI> to be thus trifled with?&mdash;It is mo&s;t certain that were there no purcha&s;ers, there would be no &s;ellers&mdash;the pro&s;pect of a market here and el&s;e|where, to tho&s;e who employ &s;laves, is the &s;ole cau&s;e, and con&s;tant &s;upport, of that ungenerous and wicked trade. I don't conceive a whit odds between the man who goes per&s;onally and &s;teals a negro lad from his parents hut, in Guinea, and brings him here, and en|&s;laves him for life, and the man who purcha&s;es one, that others have brought here: except in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, &s;ome degree of courage is requi&s;ite, which is valu|able in its &s;elf,&mdash;in the latter ca&s;e there is ba&s;ene&s;s, in|finite meanne&s;s without the &s;hadow of a virtue&mdash;Were we expo&s;ed to the &s;ame cur&s;e, &s;hould not we think that the abettors of our mi&s;ery, were the children of the devil, &s;uffered by the wrath of God to dwell on the Earth, to encrea&s;e the heavy load of human woes? Can any who are concerned in this black helli&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s, pretend to the character of chri&s;tians? I can't conclude this part, without making the following application to
<PB N="12" REF="010546_0012_0F8068F379CCCC78" MS="y">
any one that ever purcha&s;ed a &s;lave. Can you lay your hand on your brea&s;t, and declare in the pre&s;ence of al|mighty God, that you verily think, after the mo&s;t ma|ture con&s;ideration, that in purcha&s;ing one of the hu|man race as innocent as your&s;elf, and making him &s;ub|&s;urvient to your &s;overeign will, all his days, without a chance of freedom, that you in no re&s;pect deviate from that <HI>rule</HI> laid down by Chri&s;t, <HI>what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them</HI>&mdash;if you can &s;ay thus, and think you &s;hall be able to &s;ay &s;o, when clo&s;ing the &s;cene of this life, and have no compunctions of con&s;cience in your la&s;t moments, for having &s;o far promoted and encouraged the &s;lave trade, as to be a pur|cha&s;er; if this is your &s;ober thoughts, go on, buy more, dip largely in the trade, for it is profitable, and blacken the&s;e fair northern climates, as the We&s;t-Indies are <HI>black.</HI></P>
<P>What I next propo&s;e, Sir, is, to &s;how that the &s;lave trade is incon&s;i&s;tent with the intere&s;t of the Province; and I doubt not but that alone would be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on with you to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>By the importation of black &s;laves, we prevent the importation of white &s;ervants; and it is well known that there are thou&s;ands in Europe, who would gladly come among us, and might be brought here for a quar|ter the co&s;t of a black man: the&s;e white people would do all the labour for us, that we have any right to re|ceive from others; tho&s;e that cannot pay a pa&s;&s;age, mu&s;t doubtle&s;s &s;ell part of their time for it; after that is ex|pired, they can let them&s;elves as &s;ervants at as low a rate as a negro can be maintained, reckoning his co&s;t, the ri&s;que of his life, &amp;c. (perhaps I may in my next give you an account of the particulars of the annual co&s;t of a &s;lave) The&s;e white people when they have &s;erved &s;ome years in the lowe&s;t capacities, turn out

upon our wa&s;te-lands, marry and in a few years we &s;ee a Town well &s;ettled; and in le&s;s than fifty years, there will be four fold increa&s;e: by this means our country will fill up, we become re&s;pectable, and &s;ecure from an enemy, and furni&s;hed with every conveniency of life: Tho' it has been plead, that prohibiting the impor|tation of &s;laves, would cut off a large branch of trade, yet it mu&s;t be remembered that upon the whole, it is an unprofitable one for the community, becau&s;e real riches (if rum may be called &s;o) are &s;ent from this place for an article which we either might have from among our&s;elves, or we might import with little or no expor|tation; and tho' individuals may make a good advance upon their &s;tock, yet the riches are wholly got from our&s;elves, a trade which you well know Sir, is always e&s;teem'd di&s;advantageous to a community. I take it to be the policy of a &s;tate to con&s;ult mea&s;ures to have the greate&s;t number of laborers, and tho&s;e &s;o intere&s;ted in the welfare of the community, as to be always de|&s;irous and ready to &s;upport and defend it: But how con|trary to all this is the policy of &s;uffering the importati|on of a &s;ett of people, which at be&s;t puts a gain into the pockets of but a few men, and indulges the vani|ty and haughty tempers of a few more; in&s;tead of being a defence and &s;upport of the common wealth, are often its terror, and &s;ometimes its de&s;truction: For it mu&s;t be con&s;tantly expected that a &s;lave will improve every opportunity to throw off his burthen, and impo|&s;ition: New-York, &amp; mo&s;t of the Southern colonies, and We&s;t-Indies, have experienced &s;omething of that, which is enough to make all tho&s;e that &s;et a ju&s;t value upon dome&s;tic &s;ecurity, to tremble: it has been objected that their numbers are at pre&s;ent &s;o incon&s;iderable, that no|thing of that can be feared. I grant it for the pre&s;ent,
<PB N="14" REF="010546_0014_0F8068F6AA8479C8" MS="y">
but what &s;ecurity have we that this will be the ca&s;e long. I will remind you of another great evil to the community, con&s;equent upon our having black &s;laves which doubtle&s;s you have ob&s;erved, and that is, the great inconvenience our poorer &s;ort of People are put to by this means, who would gladly &s;erve us for a &s;up|port, but then they mu&s;t be upon a level with negro &s;laves; they being born free, can't think of &s;uch a di&s;grace as they e&s;teem it, and &s;o often &s;pend their youth in idlene&s;s, and for want of proper employ and government then, become ever after poor vagrants; and as to the female part of our poor youth, its too well known what cour&s;es they often take, and rather than work in the low employments, chu&s;e to tru&s;t their fa|ces for a living,&mdash;This is big with evils, that I &s;hall not pretend to enlarge upon&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;hall now con&s;ider, as I promi&s;ed in the beginning, how this trade affects private families; and evils that begin there &s;eldom end 'till the public feel them. When a &s;lave is introduced into a family, at once commences an amazing di&s;tinction: they are indeed a|mong us allowed to be of the human &s;pecies; yet &s;o very inferior, as &s;carcely to be intitled to any of its priviledges: Nay, when I think of it, I don't know of one priviledge they have above the brutes; for as to eating, drinking and &s;leeping, they are allowed them for the &s;ame rea&s;on that the bea&s;ts are, to &s;upport life and vigour, to do our labour; but as to <HI>choice</HI> or <HI>property,</HI> it is certain they can have none: Notwith&s;tanding, I &s;ay, they are allowed by us to be of our &s;pecies, yet &s;o very low, that the fir&s;t idea which children have of &s;laves, is, that they are not intitled to the &s;ame tender|ne&s;s, nor even ju&s;tice, that whites are. This produces an haughty and imperious conduct towards them, and
<PB N="15" REF="010546_0015_0F8068F798CC09A8">
often cruelty; this &s;pirit indulged towards the &s;ervants of the family, naturally influences their behaviour to all they e&s;teem their inferiors in any &s;ort, and ten to one this temper grows up with them, and they ever after be de&s;pi&s;ed by the wi&s;e and humane, and hated by all.&mdash;All writers upon the education of youth, have held it a &s;acred point to keep the minds of children as &s;u&s;ceptible as po&s;&s;ible, of kindne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion, for their fellow creatures. I think the great Mr. Lock, would not have them familiar to hurting any of the dome&s;tic animals, lea&s;t that heavenly &s;park, <HI>compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> &s;hould be extingui&s;hed, or prevented growing into that flame, which is the light and glory of the human &s;pe|cies.&mdash;But I fear your patience is exhau&s;ted, and &s;o conclude,</P>

<HEAD>A Second LETTER To a FRIEND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS brings you my con&s;ent to publi&s;h the Let|ter I wrote you &s;ome years ago, upon the African &s;lave trade: My objection aro&s;e from a hope that &s;ome abler hand would undertake a &s;ubject, in my apprehen&s;ion, worthy the be&s;t head and be&s;t heart: But as yet nothing has appeared, tho' the very enlarged &s;entiments of Liberty which have lately prevailed, among all ranks of people, one would think, naturally tended to rai&s;e up many writers again&s;t that cruel practice of en&s;laving the <HI>Blacks.</HI></P>
<P>It has always appeared very &s;trange to me, how people can be &s;o &s;en&s;ibly affected with what has but a
<PB N="18" REF="010546_0018_0F8068FCA09C8E78">
remote tendency to deprive them of their &s;malle&s;t right or priviledge, and yet remain &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of the de|plorable &s;tate of &s;o many of our &s;pecies that live among us; and further, can actually plan and execute the mo&s;t &s;ordid views of gain, at the expence of the pro|perty, and every priviledge <HI>(held dear by all mankind)</HI> of tho&s;e poor Africans, whom the white pleople have &s;trangely fix'd upon as the objects of their rapine.</P>
<P>With what con&s;i&s;tency can an American-Captain, tra|ding upon the Guinea Coa&s;t for &s;laves, open his mouth and plead for liberty, and his natural rights? Perhaps the ignorance and poverty of &s;ome of that &s;ett of men may be offer'd, as an extenuation of their guilt; e&s;pe|cially as they'll immediately a&s;k, why do the learned and rich, and even profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians engage in the &s;ame traffic, and yet talk loudly of liberty, civil and re|ligious, and tell us that without liberty, and the free di&s;po&s;al of a man's time &amp; property, life it&s;elf is not worth having? When an Engli&s;hman would paint the greate&s;t cur&s;e that can befall him, it is to be no better off than an African &s;lave; and yet he will deliberately plan a &s;cheme to increa&s;e the number of the&s;e wretches, with no greater temptation perhaps than to add a few more pounds to his crowded bags. Oh mi&s;erable &s;laves to wealth! did you never once con&s;ider your ba&s;ene&s;s as men, thus to plot and de&s;ign the ruin of &s;o many of your harmle&s;s fellow creatures? Can you con&s;ider your|&s;elves, as enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings of the Briti&s;h con&s;titu|tion, who&s;e fir&s;t principle is the &s;ecurity of your liberty and property; and feel no pity or compa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e unhappy people, who&s;e lot has fallen under the &s;evere rod of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion? Can you devi&s;e to rob them of tho&s;e few remains of liberty, which they en|joy, and not only break up their tendere&s;t connections,
<PB N="19" REF="010546_0019_0F8068FD587BE9F0">
but drag them into every part of the American world, and put them into the power of even the greate&s;t villian, if he has money to purcha&s;e? Is this the effect of your progre&s;s in all the noble arts and &s;ciences? is this the effect of your chri&s;tian knowledge? Shameful fruit! Oh! ye &s;ons of liberty, pau&s;e a moment, give me your ear, Is your conduct con&s;i&s;tent? can you review our late &s;truggles for liberty, and think of the &s;lave-trade at the &s;ame time, and not blu&s;h? Methinks were you an African, I could &s;ee you blu&s;h. How &s;hould we have been confounded and &s;truck dumb, had Great Britain thrown this incon&s;i&s;tency in our faces? how ju&s;tly might they, and all mankind have laughed at our preten&s;ions to any ju&s;t &s;entiments of Liberty, or even humanity? We claim our de&s;cent from the anci|ent Britons, who have re&s;olved from time to time, that no inhabitant of their i&s;land &s;hall be a &s;lave; and &s;hall we, who&s;e Fathers fled to America for greater Liberty than they enjoyed in Britain; &s;hall we, I &s;ay, &s;uffer Slavery to be &s;o much as once named among us?&mdash; The years 1765 &amp; 1766, will be ever memorable for the glorious &s;tand which America has made for her Liberties; how much glory will it add to us, if at the time we are e&s;tabli&s;hing Liberty for our&s;elves and chil|dren, we &s;how the &s;ame regard to all mankind that come among us? that while we are preventing the chains being put upon us, we are knocking them off from tho&s;e who already have them on?&mdash;This will &s;hew all the world, that we are true &s;ons of Liberty, and will be expre&s;&s;ive of &s;uch noble, di&s;intere&s;ted and generous &s;entiments, as will give us the highe&s;t e&s;teem among mankind, and will for ever prevent any bad mini&s;try harbouring a thought of making the lea&s;t in|fringement upon our privileges; for the people that
<PB N="20" REF="010546_0020_0F8068FE160596A8">
will forego &s;o lucrative a trade, on &s;uch principles, mu&s;t be a noble, mu&s;t be an unconquerable people.</P>
<P>I can't but hope this &s;ubject will appear of impor|tance to mo&s;t people: If &s;o, no doubt the honorable hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, and the other branches of Government, will take it into their mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;i|deration, and rejoice to have the opportunity, and be the means of fixing &s;uch la&s;ting honor upon the peo|ple they repre&s;ent and govern. Oh! what heart-felt joy mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s the brea&s;t of every one, while he is ta&s;ting the &s;weets of Liberty, while he is &s;etting under his own fig-tree, and under his own vine, while he is delighting him&s;elf with his &s;weet companion, and his &s;milling offspring around him, and none to make him afraid; if at the &s;ame time he is con&s;cious that he has done his utmo&s;t that all his fellow-men might enjoy the &s;ame happine&s;s?&mdash;It is not for me to point out to my &s;uperiours what particular laws are nece&s;&s;ary to be made, to effect &s;o noble and chri&s;tian a de&s;ign. With|out all doubt, it will be thought nece&s;&s;ary immediately to prohibit any future importation of &s;laves, which, as Dr. Franklin &s;ays, has already blackened half America. &mdash;As we are one of the greate&s;t colonies, and have in more in&s;tances than one, given the lead in affairs of high importance; let us not wait for the example of any other of our &s;i&s;ter colonies: It is prai&s;e-worthy to follow good examples: but much more &s;o to &s;et them.</P>
