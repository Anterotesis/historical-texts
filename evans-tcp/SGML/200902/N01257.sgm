<HEAD>To my Vertuous and Honour'd FRIENDS the GENTLEWOMEN of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> Who have de&s;ir'd the Publi&s;hing of this SERMON.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I DESIRE</HI> thankfully to Acknowledge the <HI>Favour</HI> of GOD to Me, in the kind <HI>Acceptance</HI> which this plain &amp; faithful <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> has found with You; Praying Him to <HI>ble&s;s</HI> it indeed for much Spiritual and Everla&s;ting Ad|vantage to Your Selves and Others: that it may help to excite You unto, and a&s;&s;i&s;t you in &s;uch an Exemplary holy <HI>Conduct,</HI> as may be your pre&s;ent Comfort &amp; Honour, and may end at la&s;t in Your Eternal Peace &amp; Glory.</P>

<P N="3">III. What more Eminently becometh Holine&s;s in <HI>Aged Women?</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. Why are <HI>They</HI> Eminently obliged to &s;uch Behaviour?</P>
<P N="1">I. WHAT <HI>is that Chri&s;tian Behaviour in General which becometh Holine&s;s?</HI> It is a <HI>Law</HI> to us all, Phil. i. 27. <HI>Only let your Con|ver&s;ation be as becometh the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI> The Go&s;pel is the Rule of Holine&s;s to us, in the holy Doctrines, Laws, Examples, and Motives of it. From the&s;e we may ea&s;ily gather what the Behaviour is that becometh Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be &s;uch as <HI>becomes the Holy Doctrines</HI> of Chri&s;tianity: the Being and Holine&s;s of GOD; the nature of Sin, the Redemption from it, the Mediation of CHRIST, the Covenant of Grace, the Im|mortality of the Soul, the Eternal Judg|ment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now what kind of Behaviour do the&s;e Doctrines imply to be plea&s;ing to

GOD, honourary to Him, and nece&s;&s;ary to our being for Ever ble&s;&s;ed in Him? <HI>Truth</HI> like the Light, is both to Irradiate and Purify: 1 Pet. i. 22. <HI>Ye have Purifyed your &s;ouls in Obeying the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, Our Behaviour mu&s;t be &s;uch as the <HI>Holy Laws</HI> of the Go&s;pel do require. What is written there? <HI>how reade&s;t thou?</HI> So live and <HI>do;</HI> and thy Behaviour will be as becometh Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>SO likewi&s;e, if it becomes the holy and <HI>glorious Example,</HI> which our <HI>Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> has given us in his ble&s;&s;ed Life.

<P>MOREOVER, Our Behaviour mu&s;t be &s;uch as becomes the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> and holy <HI>Motives</HI> of the Go&s;pel: the glorious <HI>Hopes</HI> which it wou'd beget us to: the di|rect Influence whereof is <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor vii. 1. 2 Pet i. 4. 1 Joh iii 3.</NOTE> to put us upon Purifying our &s;elves as GOD is Pure; to

<P>TO conclude, Our Behaviour mu&s;t be &s;uch as becomes the <HI>fair Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> which we make, the <HI>Vows</HI> that we are bro't under, the <HI>Means</HI> and long <HI>Day</HI> of Grace which we enjoy.

<P>THIS is the Behaviour that we profe&s;s, and which Chri&s;tianity calls for and binds unto, as the <HI>genuine fruit</HI> of Internal Holi|ne&s;s, and the only &s;ufficient <HI>Te&s;t</HI> of it.

Vice <HI>roots</HI> and fixes it &s;elf by Indulgence in Youth: Cu&s;tom in Sin <HI>hardens,</HI> and Age <HI>&s;tupefyes.</HI> If we wou'd ever be <HI>Old in Grace,</HI> it mu&s;t be found in us while we are <HI>Young:</HI> for <HI>One</HI> converted in Age is but a <HI>Young Saint;</HI> old in years but <HI>New born;</HI> Born again, tis true, but <HI>out of due time.</HI></P>
<P>TO <HI>Us</HI> who are Young GOD has ex|hibited his Grace in <HI>tho&s;e</HI> that are gone or going before us, to excite us to &s;eek it <HI>Emulou&s;ly</HI> for our <HI>&s;elves,</HI> to be our <HI>Guide</HI> and <HI>Guard</HI> thro' life, and our <HI>Crown</HI> at the

<P>LET us <HI>retain</HI> in Mind their Excellen|cies, and <HI>bury</HI> their Infirmities; not taking our Judgment of them from their <HI>pre&s;ent Decayes,</HI> but their <HI>pa&s;t U&s;e</HI> and Services, and their abiding growing Devotion.</P>
<P>LET us <HI>Pray</HI> for them, how much &s;oever our Superiors in Gifts and Graces; and return <HI>their cries</HI> to Heaven for us, in humble Reque&s;ts for their final <HI>Per&s;everance.</HI> Let us de&s;ire and ask the <HI>Continuance</HI> of &s;uch <HI>ancient Ble&s;&s;ings.</HI> Let the World ne|ver be weary of the&s;e <HI>Monuments</HI> of the Pre&s;ence of GOD in it, and His <HI>Image</HI> continued on it.

<P>FINALLY, When GOD <HI>takes away His Aged Saints, let tho&s;e that Survive weep for them&s;elves in their Death.</HI> Tho' they die in a <HI>good Old Age,</HI> and as <HI>Corn full ripe</HI> are gather'd into the <HI>Garner;</HI> yet our <HI>Lo&s;s</HI> is great in their Infinite <HI>Gain:</HI> the lo&s;s of their Example, and Faith, and Prayers.
