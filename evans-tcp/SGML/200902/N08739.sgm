<HEAD>A DIALOGUE. Between a MINISTER and his PARISHIONER, concerning the HALF-WAY-COVENANT.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PARISHIONER.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, I am di&s;&s;atisfied with a part of your public conduct, and am come to open my mind freely to you, if you will be &s;o kind as to allow me an opportunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINISTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am now at lei&s;ure, and at your &s;er|vice, and your hone&s;t frankne&s;s gives me plea&s;ure. Be|tween you and me alone to let me know the objections you have again&s;t any part of my conduct, is to act a friendly part. It is more kind and chri&s;tian-like, than to keep your thoughts to your&s;elf, to engender a &s;ecret di&s;affection in your heart.&mdash;It is much more friendly than to rail a|gain&s;t me behind my back, all round the pari&s;h. And you may be quite a&s;&s;ured, that not only now, but in all future times, I &s;hall with plea&s;ure li&s;ten to any objections again&s;t my public admini&s;trations propo&s;ed in a friendly, candid manner; and will be ready to be &s;et right, where|in I am wrong; or to let you know the rea&s;ons of my conduct. For next to the light of God's countenance, and the approbation of my own con&s;cience, I prize the good opinion of my fellow-men: And particularly, I greatly prize the te&s;timony of the con&s;ciences of my own people in my behalf. To your con&s;cience, therefore, I am now willing to approve my&s;elf. Open your mind without the lea&s;t re&s;erve.</P>

<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have lately moved into the pari&s;h; I had own|ed the covenant in the town I came from;&mdash;my other children have been baptized&mdash;we have now another child born; and I hear you refu&s;e to baptize the children of any but tho&s;e who are in full communion: This gives me pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot give you pain, without feeling pain my|&s;elf. But you would not de&s;ire, that I &s;hould go counter to the will of my Lord and Ma&s;ter, while acting in his Name, as his mini&s;ter; nor would this be a likely means to obtain a ble&s;&s;ing for your child. And if I am warrant|ed by the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t to baptize your child, you are very &s;en&s;ible, my reputation, and every worldly in|tere&s;t, will join to prompt me to it. You will ea&s;ily make a convert of me to your opinion, if you can point out one text of &s;cripture to ju&s;tify that common practice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not &s;tudied the point. I cannot mention any text of &s;cripture; but it is the cu&s;tom where I was born and brought up; and I knew not but that it was the cu&s;tom every where, 'till I moved into this pari&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, it is not the cu&s;tom every where; it was not the cu&s;tom where I was born and brought up; and there are many churches in the country, that are not in the practice. At the fir&s;t &s;ettling of New-England, there was, &s;o far as I know, not one church that allowed bapti&s;m to the children of any but tho&s;e who&s;e parents were one or both in full communion. About 40 years after the fir&s;t church was formed, this cu&s;tom was brought in by a Synod that met at Bo&s;ton 1662. Many mini&s;ters and churches zealou&s;ly oppo&s;ed it at the time, and even to this day, the cu&s;tom is not become univer&s;al: And of late a con&s;iderable number of churches, who had adopted the practice, have laid it a&s;ide. It is not practi&s;ed at all in the church of Scotland, as I have been informed by a Rev. Gentleman of an e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation, who has lately been invited, and who has removed from thence, to the Pre&s;idency of New-Jer&s;ey College. And it is certain
<PB N="5" REF="011172_0005_0F857FC23B0F6668">
the confe&s;&s;ion of faith, catechi&s;ms and directory of the church of Scotland, make no mention of it; Neither is the practice mentioned in the Say-Brook platform, which has been generally received by the churches in Connecti|cut; for the council which met at Say-Brook, did not &s;ee cau&s;e to adopt that practice, although it had been intro|duced by the Synod at Bo&s;ton.&mdash;But if you had not &s;tudied the point before you owned the covenant; and if you took it for granted, that it was right, merely from education, yet you are able to let me know in what views, and from what motives you owned the covenant: As I &s;uppo&s;e you meant to act con&s;cientiou&s;ly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was the common opinion that none ought to join in full communion, and come to the Lord's table, but tho&s;e that were godly, that had on a <HI>wedding garment, le&s;t coming unworthily, they eat and drink damnation to them|&s;elves.</HI> But it was thought that gracele&s;s per&s;ons might own the covenant, and have their children baptized; and this was my opinion, and I acted on the&s;e principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, and I &s;uppo&s;e the generality of people in the country, that own the covenant, in the&s;e times, act on the&s;e principles: But it was not &s;o from the begin|ning. The Synod in 1662, who fir&s;t brought in the practice, were not in this &s;cheme. It was known, and owned, and publicly declared on all hands, in the time of it; <Q>That the Synod did acknowledge, that there ought to be true &s;aving faith in the parent, according to the judgment of rational charity, or el&s;e the child ought not to be baptized. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a Defence of the An&s;wer and Arguments of the Synod, &amp;c. again&s;t the Reply made by the Rev Mr. <HI>John Davenport,</HI> Pa&s;tor of the Church at <HI>New Haven.</HI> Preface, pag. 23, 24.</NOTE></Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, I am &s;urpri&s;ed! Is this true? Was this really the opinion of tho&s;e who fir&s;t brought in this practice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, it was indeed their opinion, if we may give credit to their own declarations. No man who was
<PB N="6" REF="011172_0006_0F857FC2DFAD96B0">
for this practice, was of more note than the Rev. Dr. In|crea&s;e Mather, of Bo&s;ton, who was a member of the Sy|nod, and afterwards wrote in defence of this practice; and no author can in more expre&s;s language declare his &s;entiments. The&s;e are his own words, in a pamphlet, entituled, <HI>A di&s;cour&s;e concerning the &s;ubject of Bapti&s;m, wherein the pre&s;ent Controver&s;ies that are agitated in the New-England Churches are from &s;cripture &amp; rea&s;on mode&s;tly enquired into,</HI> pag. 52, 53. <Q>In the fifth place, it may be alledged, that the per&s;ons in que&s;tion, either have to the judgment of charity, a ju&s;tifying faith, or not. If not, they, and con&s;equently their children, are not bap|tizable. If yea, then they are forthwith admittable to the Lord's &s;upper.</Q> An&s;wer.</P>
<P N="1"><Q>1. I do readily acknowledge, that as it is only a ju&s;ti|fying faith which giveth right to bapti&s;m before God; &s;o it is the profe&s;&s;ion or vi&s;ibility of this faith, that giv|eth right thereunto before the church. Some have maintained that a <HI>dogmatical hi&s;torical</HI> faith, or a faith of <HI>a&s;&s;ent</HI> to the truth of the go&s;pel, doth entitle to bap|ti&s;m. But the common prote&s;tant doctrine again&s;t the papi&s;ts, &s;peaketh otherwi&s;e. Though a man &s;hould be|lieve all that the holy &s;criptures &s;ay concerning God and Chri&s;t, yet if he doth not con&s;ent with his heart, that this God &s;hall be <HI>his God,</HI> and this Chri&s;t <HI>his Saviour,</HI> he hath not right to bapti&s;m in the &s;ight of God; or if he doth not <HI>profe&s;s</HI> &s;uch a <HI>con&s;ent,</HI> (which is implied in the proportion before us, when it is &s;aid concerning the per&s;ons in que&s;tion, that they <HI>gave up them&s;elves to the Lord</HI>) he cannot ju&s;tly claim bapti&s;m. In mo&s;t churches in the world, men own the creed, (called the Apo&s;tles) before bapti&s;m. Now therein they &s;ay, I believe [in] God, and not only I believe God, viz. with a faith of a&s;&s;ent only in the under&s;tanding. Now to believe <HI>in</HI> God, implieth a <HI>con&s;ent of the will,</HI> choo&s;ing this God for my God. And con&s;idering that in bap|ti&s;m, there is a profe&s;&s;ion of repentance for pa&s;t tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="7" REF="011172_0007_0F857FC3B12D8210">
and an engagement to walk in newne&s;s of life for time to come, <HI>Mark</HI> i. 4.2 <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 9 And that it cometh in the room of circumci&s;ion, which was a &s;eal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 11. And that there|by remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins is &s;ealed, <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 38. Which re|mi&s;&s;ion is not promi&s;ed to any faith but ju&s;tifying; al&s;o that bapti&s;m is &s;aid to &s;ave, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 21. And they that are baptized are &s;aid to be in Chri&s;t, <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 17. And to have communion with Chri&s;t in re&s;pect of his death and re&s;urrection, <HI>Rom.</HI> vi. 4, 5. <HI>Col.</HI> ii. 12. I &s;ay, from the&s;e and many the like con&s;iderations, I am fully per&s;uaded that it is not a mere hi&s;torical, but ju&s;tifying faith which giveth right to bapti&s;m.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are his words, and they are as plain and expre&s;s as could be de&s;ired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if this was in fact the ca&s;e, I cannot conceive what room there was for the half-way covenant! For &s;uch per&s;ons might con&s;i&s;tently profe&s;s to comply with the whole covenant, and not &s;top half-way in practice, but come up to all ordinances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right in this ob&s;ervation. Per&s;ons &s;o qua|lified, who have been brought up under the light of the go&s;pel from their infancy, by pious parents, and godly mini&s;ters, and now adult, and become godly them&s;elves, profe&s;&s;ing and practi&s;ing accordingly; are in a judgment of rational charity, as fit for the Lord's table, as to offer their children in bapti&s;m. Nor is it merely a privilege they may claim, to come to the Lord's &s;upper along with their chri&s;tian brethren, and join with them in commemo|rating the death of Chri&s;t; but it is their indi&s;pen&s;ible duty. They are bound to do it by the expre&s;s command of Chri&s;t, <HI>Luk.</HI> xxii. 19. <HI>This do in remembrance of me.</HI> And to neglect it, is practically to renounce the authority of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And is it right for mini&s;ters to teach the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t to live in the breach of the lea&s;t of his commands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what would Dr. Mather &s;ay to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="011172_0008_0F857FC459AA4C18">
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may hear, for the&s;e are his words: (P. 54.)&mdash; <Q>It will not follow that the&s;e per&s;ons are immediately to be admitted to the Lord's table, or to the privileges of full communion. For <HI>more full and &s;atisfactory eviden|ces</HI> of regeneration and of chri&s;tian proficiency, are re|qui&s;ite in order to admi&s;&s;ion to the Lord's table, than in order to bapti&s;m.</Q> And if you will read <HI>Mather</HI>'s <HI>Magnalia,</HI> you will &s;ee, that they in&s;i&s;ted on <HI>Initial grace</HI> in order to bapti&s;m, but &s;uppo&s;ed greater attainments nece&s;&s;ary in order to the Lord's &s;upper. But if that command of Chri&s;t is binding on weak chri&s;tians, who are indeed real chri&s;tians, <HI>Luk.</HI> xxii. 19. To &s;ay they are not to be ad|mitted to the Lord's table, is to &s;ay, it is not lawful they &s;hould obey the command of Chri&s;t. So this half-way-covenant while it teaches for doctrine the commandment of men &s;ets a&s;ide the command of Chri&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am in the &s;ame opinion&mdash;nor can I &s;ee any room for the half-way-covenant on <HI>Mather's</HI> &s;cheme: But I have heard that <HI>Stoddard's</HI> &s;cheme favours the pre&s;ent practice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a mi&s;take. Mr. Stoddard of Northampton, never practiced the half-way, i. e. he never admitted any to have bapti&s;m for their children, but tho&s;e who were in full communion, and he expre&s;ly declares that tho&s;e who have been baptized in infancy, and owned their covenant, are obliged in duty to come to the Lord's table. Yea, he &s;ays, (appeal p. 63, edit. 2.) <Q>It is a &s;candal if they do not, and the church may call them to an account for their neglect. It is a vi&s;ible contempt ca&s;t upon the or|dinance.</Q> He held the Lord's &s;upper to be a converting ordinance: And that unconverted men knowing them&s;elves to be &s;uch, might lawfully come. And that it was as law|ful to come to the Lord's &s;upper, as to bapti&s;m, (p. 77.) &s;o that there was no room for any half-way-covenant or half-way-practice, on his &s;cheme. For unconverted men knowing them&s;elves to be &s;uch may on his &s;cheme come not only half-way, but to all ordinances, and to one as well as to another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="011172_0009_0F857FC994F1A220">
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard of the&s;e things till now, and I know not what to think or what to &s;ay. It &s;eems as if the half-way-covenant, and the half-way-practice, could not be made con&s;i&s;tent on any &s;cheme.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the covenant owned is the covenant of grace, and if the parent acts under&s;tandingly and hone&s;tly in the affair, he is a good man, he has a right before God to bapti&s;m for his children, and an equal right to the Lord's &s;upper: Yea, that command of Chri&s;t in <HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 19. renders it his indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to attend the Lord's &s;upper. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Under the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation it was lawful for an I&s;raelite, not hindered by any external impediment, voluntarily to ab&s;ent him|&s;elf from the pa&s;&s;over, if he was ceremonially unclean. But under the go&s;pel an I&s;raelite indeed, of &s;ufficient age and under&s;tanding, and not hindered by any natural impediment, may not voluntarily ab&s;ent him&s;elf from the Lord's &s;upper, unle&s;s di&s;qualified by &s;piri|tual uncleanne&s;s, by his own per&s;onal wickedne&s;s unrepented of, or for which he has not made go&s;pel &s;atisfaction. And &s;uch an one is equally unfit to offer his child in bapti&s;m. Num. 9.13. Mat. 5.23, 24.</NOTE> But if the covenant owned is not the covenant of grace, tho&s;e who have owned it have in the &s;ight of God no right to either of tho&s;e ordinances which are &s;eals of that covenant, and of no other: No more right than if they had given their a&s;&s;ent to any chapter in the apocrypha.&mdash;Did you never hear it ob&s;erved and talked of, that tho&s;e who own the co|venant make as full and large a profe&s;&s;ion as they who join in full communion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. And my former mini&s;ter read the &s;ame co|venant to &s;uch as owned the covenant, as he did to tho&s;e that joined in full communion, word for word, only one did not promi&s;e to come up to all ordinances, and the other did. And I mu&s;t confe&s;s this &s;ometimes &s;tumbled me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you plea&s;e, &s;ir, I will repeat the covenant we u&s;e when any join in full communion, the &s;ame that was read to me by my mini&s;ter, when I joined to the church about three and thirty years ago. A brief &s;ummary of it is this,&mdash; <Q>You do now in the pre&s;ence of the dread Maje&s;ty of Heaven and Earth, and before angels and men, in

the &s;incerity of your &s;oul, avouch the Lord Jehovah to be your &s;overeign Lord, and &s;upreme Good, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and &s;olemnly devote and give up your&s;elf to his fear and &s;ervice, to walk in all his ways and keep all his commands, &s;eeking his glory,</Q> &amp;c.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think not, it is very much like it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far as I am acquainted, the forms in u&s;e all over the country, a very few in&s;tances excepted, are very much alike. The only difference of any con&s;equence lies in practice. I think it my duty, in private, as well as public, to explain the covenant, and to &s;ee to it, that per&s;ons un|der&s;tand it before they make it, and know what they are about to do, and are &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed that it is a wicked thing to <HI>lie to God with their mouths and flatter him with their lips.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, &s;ir, no doubt this is a mini&s;ter's duty. But, alas for me, I never knew what I was about, nor con|&s;idered the import of the words, I publicly gave my con|&s;ent unto. I knew my&s;elf to be unconverted.&mdash;I meant to own the covenant, as the phra&s;e is, and have my children baptized; but I had no de&s;ign to profe&s;s godline&s;s, or to pretend a real compliance with the covenant of grace. This godly people may do: But it had been great hypocri&s;y in me to do it. To lie to men is bad, but to lie to God is wor&s;e. I &s;uppo&s;ed that owning the covenant was what the unconverted might do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can a man that knows him&s;elf to be uncon|verted, dead in &s;in, and de&s;titute of the grace of God, &s;tand up before the whole congregation, and &s;ay, <Q>I do now in the pre&s;ence of the dread Maje&s;ty of Heaven and Earth, and before angels and men, avouch the Lord Jehovah to be my &s;overeign Lord, and &s;upreme Good, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;olemnly devote and give up my&s;elf to his fear and &s;ervice, to walk in all his ways, and keep all his commands, &s;eeking his glory</Q>?&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I freely own I knew not what I did, when I owned the covenant.&mdash;But you hinted ju&s;t now, that this is not the cu&s;tom in all the churches where the half-way-practice takes place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard of a few churches where the mini&s;ters have of late drawn up a new form for tho&s;e who own the covenant, e&s;&s;entially different from that which is u&s;ed when any one is admitted to full communion; which new form de&s;ignedly leaves out the covenant of grace, and contains a profe&s;&s;ion, which unconverted men may make, and yet &s;peak true. And this, with greater propriety, may be called the half-way-covenant, although indeed, it does not go half-way, and gives no right to tho&s;e ordi|nances which are &s;eals of the covenant of grace. Be&s;ides, God never did propo&s;e any covenant to mankind, but which required real holine&s;s on man's part; and any co|venant &s;hort of this, is a mere human device. It is teach|ing for doctrine the commandment of men, directly con|trary to the expre&s;s orders of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to his apo&s;tles, and all their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Mat. 28.20. <HI>Teaching them to ob&s;erve what&s;oever I command you.</HI>&mdash;The covenant with Adam, required perfect holine&s;s, without any provi&s;ion for pardon in ca&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;The covenant at Sinai, written on the two tables of &s;tone, called <HI>the tables of the covenant,</HI> containing ten commands, according to our Saviour's interpretation, required them <HI>to love God with all their heart, and their neighbour as them&s;elves,</HI> in which the &s;um of all virtue con&s;i&s;ts; (Mat. 22.37&mdash;40.) But however it made provi&s;ion for pardon to the true peni|tent, through &s;hedding of blood, but not for impenitent &s;inners, Lev. 26. 1 Kin. 8. And it is acknowledged on all hands, Antinomians excepted, that repentance toward God, and &s;aith toward Chri&s;t, are required in the cove|nant of grace, as revealed in the go&s;pel. The&s;e ungraci|ous covenants, therefore, are not from heaven, but of men.</P>

<P>My con&s;cience is convinced. I am obliged to give up the half-way-covenant; but it is with no &s;mall reluct|ance: For what will become of my child? Mu&s;t it re|main unbaptized? I cannot bear the thought. What &s;hall I do?</P>

<P>Is it lawful for a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t to baptize any one without a divine warrant?</P>

<P>Is bapti&s;m admini&s;tered without a divine warrant, a likely means to do a child any good?</P>

<P>No. But where is your commi&s;&s;ion to baptize? And what is the tenor of it?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>In <HI>Mark</HI> xvi. 15, 16. <HI>Go preach the go&s;pel to every creature.</HI> Thus unlimited is the commi&s;&s;ion to preach the go&s;pel. <HI>And he that believeth, and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> The faith which entitles to bapti&s;m, is a &s;aving &s;aith. Accordingly when the multitude were pricked at the heart, on the day of Penteco&s;t, Peter did not &s;ay, <HI>own the covenant;</HI> nor did he &s;ay, <HI>join in full communion:</HI> But <HI>repent</HI> fir&s;t of all, <HI>and</HI> then <HI>be baptized in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, Acts</HI> ii. 38. And with the &s;ame &s;acred regard to the di|vine commi&s;&s;ion, Philip &s;aid to the eunuch, <HI>If thou be|lieve&s;t with all thine heart, thou maye&s;t,</HI> Acts 8.37. And it is a &s;ettled point on all hands, that if parents have no right to bapti&s;m for them&s;elves, their children can have no right on their account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it lawful for me to join in full communion, when I know I have no grace? Can I an&s;wer it to God?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You remember when the King came in to view the gue&s;ts, he &s;aw a man among them <HI>not having on a wed|ding garment;</HI> to whom he &s;aid, <HI>Friend, how came&s;t thou in hither, not having on a wedding garment? And he was &s;peechle&s;s.</HI> To make a fal&s;e and lying profe&s;&s;ion, is inex|cu&s;able wickedne&s;s. It is true, there will be <HI>tares</HI> along with the <HI>wheat;</HI> but it is <HI>the Devil &s;aws</HI> them there, and not the &s;ervants. And it <HI>&s;elfe brethren</HI> come into the

<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does not my own bapti&s;m render me a church-member, and entitle my child to bapti&s;m, although I am de&s;titute of faith and repentance?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Circumci&s;ion verily profiteth if thou keep the law: But if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumci&s;ion is made uncircumci&s;ion. For he is not a Jew, that is one outwardly, neither is that circumci&s;ion which is outward in the fle&s;h,</HI> Rom. ii. 25, 28. One baptized in infancy, who in the &s;ight of God practically renounces his bapti&s;m when adult, as all do who reject Chri&s;t, and continue impeni|tent, is not con&s;idered by God, as entitled to the ble&s;&s;ings of the new covenant, but as under the cur&s;e of the law. <HI>He that believeth not is condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on him,</HI> John iii. 19, 36. And what right hath this man to the &s;eals of the covenant of grace, in the &s;ight of God, who is by Chri&s;t him&s;elf declared to be under condemnation and wrath?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if I have no right to bapti&s;m for my poor child, I mu&s;t be &s;ilent. But I wi&s;h it might be baptized.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you allow me to examine the earne&s;t de&s;ire of bapti&s;m which you expre&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ought to be willing. I ought to know the mo|tives that influence me; for God knows them, whether I do or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to &s;ee your mind &s;o &s;erious and candid. If this temper &s;hould continue, I &s;hould hope all your doubts would be removed.&mdash;For I can tell you &s;eriou&s;ly, I am willing to baptize your child, provided you do under|&s;tandingly, and with all your heart de&s;ire it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do I not? I &s;hould be a cruel parent if I did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bapti&s;m, you know, is admini&s;tered <HI>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> In bapti&s;m, therefore, you dedicate your child to God the Father, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t his Son, to be &s;anctified by
<PB N="14" REF="011172_0014_0F857FCCB44B3CD0">
the Holy Gho&s;t; and &s;o give up your child with all your heart to the Lord for ever, to be educated for God, and to be for him, and for him alone, in time and to eternity. And do you love God to that degree, as thus to give him your child for ever; if &s;o, why do not give your&s;elf to God, fir&s;t of all? You love your child, but you love your&s;elf bet|ter. Fir&s;t of all then cea&s;e to be cruel to your own &s;oul; no longer practically renounce your own bapti&s;m, by turning your back on God and the Redeemer; but act up to its genuine import; give your&s;elf to God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t his Son, that you may become the temple of the Holy Gho&s;t; and thus ratify what your parents did for you, when they dedicated you to God in bapti&s;m. This is that owning of the bapti&s;mal covenant which God re|quires at your hands. Then bring your dear child, and con&s;ecrate it to God in &s;incerity and truth. This is the way, the right way, for a ble&s;&s;ing. But if in&s;tead of this, you are moved only by cu&s;tom, by a &s;en&s;e of worldly honor, by pride and &s;hame; and de&s;ire that holy ordinance to be admini&s;tered to your child from unholy motives, as Simon Magus de&s;ired the miraculous gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t to an&s;wer his carnal ends: God knows it, and all the world will know it at the day of judgment.&mdash;Pray, how was it when your other children were baptized? And how is it in general to all appearance when people own the covenant and get their children baptized? Are they brought up for God? Or only to &s;erve divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures? Look through the country, wherever you are acquainted, the youth learn to dre&s;s, to &s;ing, to dance; but do their parents appear to under&s;tand, that they have devoted them to God? And is this evidently their great concern to bring them up for God? But to leave others, and to attend only to your own heart. Can it be true, that you have a heart to give your child to God, and yet not a heart to give your&s;elf to him? Think of it, my dear &s;ir.</P>

<P>I mu&s;t grant that it is ab&s;urd and incon&s;i&s;tent, for a parent to pretend to have a heart to give his child to God, and yet have no heart to give him&s;elf to him. But I do de&s;ire to give my&s;elf to God.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, &s;ir, what then hinders you from giving your|&s;elf to him? You may de&s;ire to e&s;cape everla&s;ting mi&s;ery, you may de&s;ire to be happy for ever; &s;o Balaam did: Self-love may excite to this, where there is no love to God in the heart. But if you love God &s;o, as to be will|ing to have him for your portion; if you love Chri&s;t &s;o, as to be willing to deny your&s;elf, take up your cro&s;s and follow him; you may have your choice: You may do as you like: <HI>Come, for all things are now ready.</HI> And if you would now in fact make this choice, it would put an end to your pre&s;ent difficulties about your child. Nothing, therefore, can hinder the bapti&s;m of your child, but your continuing to reject God and the Redeemer, by which you practically renounce your own bapti&s;m, and forfeit all the ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant.</P>

<P>Is not God your Creator? Are you not his by an ori|ginal, ab&s;olute, entire right? Is he not infinitely worthy of your &s;upreme love? Were you not in your infancy dedi|cated to him in bapti&s;m? And have you turned your back upon him to this very hour? And practically renounced your bapti&s;m in his &s;ight? So that dying in this &s;tate, your bapti&s;m will be of no advantage to you; you will peri&s;h among the uncircumci&s;ed, among the unbaptized, among pagans; as it is written, <HI>he that believeth not &s;hall be damn|ed,</HI> and <HI>except ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h!</HI> And do you now enquire, what you &s;hall do? Ah, may dear &s;ir! The an&s;wer is plain. <HI>Repent and be converted, that your &s;ins may be blotted out.</HI> And thus at la&s;t comply with the import of your bapti&s;m.
