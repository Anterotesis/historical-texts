<P>_THE DUTARTRES were a Family of French Extraction, con&s;i&s;ting of the two Parents and eight Children, four Sons and four Daughters, &s;ettled in Orange-Quarter, in this Province. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">SOUTH-CAROLIN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> They were always in low Circum&s;tan|ces in Life, but of hone&s;t Repute; and for many Years behaved them&s;elves regu|larly and blamele&s;s in all outward In&s;tan|ces of religious and moral Duty. But &s;ome Years before the <HI>fatal Period,</HI> came hither a certain &s;trolling Moravian, Dutch or Swi&s;s Enthu&s;ia&s;t, named CHRISTIAN GEORGE; who partly by Conver|&s;ation, and partly by the Writings of JACOB BEHMEN, &amp;c. &s;oon filled their Heads with many wild and fanta&s;tic Notions. In a Year or two's Time, they began to <HI>withdraw</HI> or <HI>&s;eparate</HI> from public Wor&s;hip, and all outward Ordinances of God in his Church, and from all Conver&s;ation with the World as much as po&s;&s;ible; and &s;trongly to conceit that they were the <HI>alone</HI> Family upon Earth who had the true Knowledge and Wor&s;hip of God, and whom he vouch&s;afed to in&s;truct and direct either by the im|mediate Impul&s;es of his Holy Spirit, or by Signs and Tokens which he gave them. Finally, it came to open Vi&s;ions and Re|velations. They imagined <HI>that God had rai&s;ed up a Prophet unto them from among them&s;elves</HI> (Viz.

And thus they con|tinued in open and notorious Adultery and Ince&s;t, 'till the fatal Period we now come to mention. So far po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed were the&s;e Per&s;ons with a Conceit of their own Holine&s;s, and of the Impu|rity and Wickedne&s;s of others, that they would give no Obe|dience to the civil Magi&s;trate, nor to any of the Laws and Or|din<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ces of Men, and accordingly refu&s;ed to comply either with the Militia Law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Pretence that God had revealed to them not to bear A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or the Law for repairing the High|wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

examined and bound over to the general Se&s;&s;ions for Ba&s;tardy, pur&s;uant to a Law of this Province. The Con&s;table having received the&s;e Warrants, got two or three or his Neighbours to go with him, doubting what U&s;age he might meet with from &s;o odd a Family. The DUTARTRES appri&s;ed of his Coming and Errand, con&s;ulted their Prophet, who &s;oon told them, that God commanded them to arm and defend them&s;elves, and their Sub&s;tance, from the Per&s;ecution and Robberies of the Men of the Earth, and that no Weapon formed again&s;t them &s;hould pro&s;per. On which they forthwith arm them&s;elves, fire upon the Con&s;table, and tho&s;e Per&s;ons with him, and drive them out of their Ground.</P>
<P>THIS was not to be &s;uffered; and therefore the Ju&s;tice taking with him. Ten or Twelve Men of the Militia, went to protect the Con&s;table in the Execution of his Office. On their Ap|proach, this deluded Family &s;hut them&s;elves up in their Hou&s;e, and then fired like &s;o many Furies, Shot the Ju&s;tice Dead on the Spot, and Wounded &s;everal of his Men. At length the Hou&s;e was forced open, Mrs. LESAD, was found killed and the re&s;t Six in Number taken Pri&s;oners, and brought hither to CHARLES-TOWN; where at a &s;pecial Court of General Se&s;&s;ions, held the Twenty Ninth, and Thirtieth of September, One Thou&s;and Seven Hundred and Twenty-four, Five of them, Namely, MICHAEL BOINEAU, PETER DUTARTE, DANIEL DUTARTE, JOHN DUTARTE, and PETER ROMBERT, were arraigned, and tried for Murder, found Guilty and Condemned.&mdash;But were the&s;e mi&s;erable Wretches ever convinced of their Delu&s;ion? The three chief of them, Viz. The Prophet, the Father of the Family, and MICHAEL BOINEAU, confidently per&s;i&s;ted in their Delu&s;ion to their la&s;t Breath.&mdash;They appeared on their Trials, all together ea&s;y and unconcerned. They a&s;&s;erted <HI>they had God on their Side, and therefore feared not what Men could do unto them.</HI> They freely told the ince&s;tuous Story in all its Circum&s;tances, as above-mentioned, in open Court, with a good Countenance; very readily owned the Facts and Circum&s;tances of the Rebel|lion, and the Murder charged upon them, pled Ju&s;tification in all as authori&s;ed of God by immediate Revelations from him, averring they had done Nothing in the one or the other of the Ca&s;es but by his expre&s;s Orders and Command.&mdash;As the vi&s;iting of Per&s;ons under Sentence of Death is a Part of my

They very readily owned, repeated and confirmed, all the Facts and Circum&s;tances as before-mentioned with no material Variation from what they had done in Court. But when I came to Rea|&s;on with them on tho&s;e Facts, and endeavour to convince them of the Errors and Wickedne&s;s they were guilty of in com|mitting them, they treated me with great Di&s;dain&mdash;Their Motto was, <HI>An&s;wer him not a Word!</HI> They were confident they had the Spirit of God Speaking inwardly to their Souls, and who was I to pretend to talk to, or in&s;truct them? They had obeyed the Voice of God, and were about to &s;uffer Martyrdom for it. But God had a&s;&s;ured them, that he would either Work a great Deliverance for them, or rai&s;e them up from the Dead on the third Day. And thus the three before-mentioned, who were Executed continued to in&s;i&s;t to their Dying Breath. Their la&s;t Words to the Spectators were, <HI>that they &s;hould &s;urely &s;ee them alive again from the Dead the third Day.</HI>&mdash;As to the other three, the Daughter JUDITH was not tried. The two Sons DANIEL, and JOHN DUTARTRE, Lad's of about Eighteen or Twenty Years of Age, who were Tried and Condemned, con|tinued &s;ullen 'till after finding no Re&s;urrection of the others from the Dead, as they expected, they became &s;en&s;ible of their Delu&s;ion, at lea&s;t profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves &s;o, and were pardoned.</P>
<P>BUT Ala&s;s! one of them relap&s;ed into the &s;ame Snare, and Murdered an Innocent Per&s;on, without any previous Quarrel or Provocation, and for no other Rea&s;on as he acknowledged, but that God had revealed it to him, it was his Duty to do it. He was Tried for this Murder, found Guilty, Condemned and Executed. I attended him again, under this Second Sentence of Death, and it plea&s;ed God with all apparent Hopes of Suc|ce&s;s. No one ever appeared more &s;en&s;ible of his Delu&s;ion, or to die a more hearty and &s;incere Penitent, or in greater pro|fe&s;&s;ed Hopes of Salvation through the al&s;ufficient Merits of CHRIST his Redeemer.</P>
<P>THUS ended this Tragical Scene of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, immediate Revelations and Strong Impul&s;es; by following which no le&s;s than &s;even Per&s;ons lo&s;t their Lives, one Killed, two Murdered, and four Executed for tho&s;e Murders. A remarkable In&s;tance to what Heights of Extravagance, Folly and Wickedne&s;s, Per&s;ons who hold &s;uch Principles, and pretend to immediate Revelations, and to follow Impul&s;es may be hurried!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MEN AND BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my Station is Life and Connexions with &s;ome of you called me to make a pretty full Enquiry, into your No|tions about Religion; I have taken a good Deal of Pains in my Searches on this Point. I have conver&s;ed largely, Time after Time, with &s;undry of you on your peculiar Principles; and have read, and maturely con&s;idered, &s;undry Books which have been written to defend them. I have gotten all the Information about you, I could, from &s;ober, judicious Men, who were look|ed upon to be well acquainted with your Principles and Practices in other Parts of the Colony, and in the neighbouring Provinces. Thus, I have carefully endeavoured to guard again&s;t ha&s;ty preju|dices and Party Spirit; &s;o that I have &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons to be|lieve, that my pre&s;ent Opinion of you is well founded.</P>
<P>From this full and candid Examination of your religious Noti|ons, and Practices proceeding from them, I am well a&s;&s;ured you are greatly mi&s;taken. It appears evident to me, that your No|tions of <HI>immediate Impul&s;es</HI> and <HI>Revelations</HI> are extremely dangerous; and that your Method of applying and (as you call it) <HI>&s;pirituali|zing</HI> the Holy Scriptures, expo&s;es you, and tho&s;e who give Heed to you, to &s;uch Temptations, as Satan has made U&s;e of to per|&s;uade Per&s;ons to commit the mo&s;t horrid Crimes. Methinks &s;uch awful In&s;tances of following &s;trong Impul&s;es may warn the World, and convince Men of the pernicious Tendency of <HI>real</HI> Fanatici&s;m.</P>
<P>Permit me then, while the&s;e &s;hocking Monuments of Satan's Delu&s;ion are before your Eyes, to make one Attempt, in Love and Compa&s;&s;ion, to &s;hew you your unhappy Mi&s;takes; and to prevent &s;ober well-meaning Per&s;ons from being deceived by the Impul&s;es, Revelations, &amp;c. to which tho&s;e who are properly cal|led Enthu&s;ia&s;ts pretend.</P>
<P>It is indeed true, that there have been &s;uch In&s;tances of evi|dent Delu&s;ion among you, as have convinced many who once

<P>Hence, I don't write &s;o much for the Sake of your Ringlead|ers, who are ob&s;tinately determined to maintain the Opinions they have embraced at all Adventures, right or wrong; and their confirmed Di&s;ciples, as for the &s;ake of &s;ome hone&s;t well meaning Per&s;ons, that have been unwarily captivated by their &s;pecious Pretences and extraordinary Zeal; and to inform others, who are &s;till at a Lo&s;s about them, that they may be prevented from embracing their dangerous Errors.

Remember it is written, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">James i, 19, 20.</NOTE> <Q>Let every Man be &s;wift to hear, &s;low to &s;peak, &s;low to Wrath. For the Wrath of Man work|eth not the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God.</Q> The be&s;t of Men may be mi&s;taken in &s;ome Things, &s;ince none are infalliable. Is it notthen a Part of true Chri&s;t. Charity to &s;hew Men their Mi&s;takes? Why &s;hould any become Enemies to me, becau&s;e I tell them the Truth?&mdash;It is honorable for Men to yield to the Force of Truth, and for&s;ake their Errors. But it is &s;hocking Pride and a Ba&s;ene&s;s peculiar to wicked &amp; weak Minds to re&s;i&s;t the Truth; and to pre|tend, they are more confirmed in their Mi&s;takes by the Arguments that are u&s;ed to convince them. Such Per&s;ons often vent them|&s;elves in angry Reproaches and railing, being de&s;titute of better Rea&s;ons. If any can be &s;o &s;illy as to think &s;uch Treatment can be any Advantage to them, or their Cau&s;e, they are quite wel|come for any Thing that concerns me.</P>
<P>All who have any &s;erious Regard for Religion will readily acknowledge, that Mi&s;takes about it may have the wor&s;t Con&s;e|quences. And a moderate Share of Acquaintance with the Hi&s;|tory of the Chri&s;tian World would di&s;cover, that there are no Mi&s;takes about Religion which are of a more pernicious Ten|dency, or have produced more &s;hocking Con&s;equences, than tho&s;e which ari&s;e from Enthu&s;ia&s;m. Have not the high Pretences of Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, to immediate Impul&s;es and Revelations, prejudiced many again&s;t the convincing, converting and &s;anctifying Influ|ences of the Spirit?

<P>The Enthu&s;ia&s;m which &s;o greatly prevailed in Cromwell's Time, the Lay-Exhorters and Soldier-Preachers, prepared the Way for that Flood of Arminiani&s;m and Irreligion, which over|flowed the Nation in the &s;ucceeding Reigns.

<P>Is it not evident that where Separations have mo&s;t generally prevailed in New-England; loo&s;e Principles and vicious Practices have &s;ucceeded in their Turn, and increa&s;ed in Proportion as the Separations had done, e&s;pecially among the ri&s;ing Generation? And is not one great Cau&s;e of this, that &s;uch Per&s;ons educate their Children in a Di&s;regard and Contempt of regular Preaching and Ordinances? For when they grow up to Years of Di&s;creti|on, their own Rea&s;on teaches them that the gro&s;s Mi&s;takes of their Parents cannot be right. Yet they cannot ea&s;ily &s;hake off the Prejudices their Parents early in&s;tilled into their Minds again&s;t the &s;tanding Mini&s;try. Hence, they lo&s;e all Benefit of publick Preaching, grow carele&s;s about Religion and too often openly vicious. However little Regard you pay to me, or to the &s;tand|ing Churches; you had better con&s;ider your Conduct for your own Sakes, and the Sakes of your Children, who are likely to be great Sufferers in their &s;piritual Intere&s;ts, by their clo&s;e Connexions with you.</P>

<P>As to the Teachings and Influences of the Holy Spirit.

<P N="1">1.

The divine Character of this Teacher ne|ce&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es, that when he undertook to in&s;truct Mankind in the Will of God, he would do it as fully and perfectly, as was nece&s;&s;ary for them in their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances.

It was ob&s;erved, that, <Q>Becau&s;e Sentance <HI>again&s;t</HI> an evil Work is not executed &s;peedily; therefore the Heart of the Sons of Men is fully &s;et in them to do Evil.</Q> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. viii. 11.</NOTE> And it is certain that the wicked were &s;o often pro&s;perous, and the righteous afflicted during that Di&s;pen&s;ation, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent Saints were greatly &s;tumbled at it.

<P>The &s;ame Covenant of Grace was admini&s;tered under the Old Te&s;tament as under the New, tho' in a different Manner. The &s;ame Salvation was preached, the &s;ame Saviour was repre&s;ented and typified, tho' with different Rites, and in a more ob&s;cure Man|ner. Temporal Ble&s;&s;ings and Puni&s;hments were but Appendages to the Abrahamic Covenant.</P>
<P>God carried on the Scheme of eternal Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t then, as well as now, and recommended it by the &s;ame Heaven and Hell. And tho' this Salvation was not &s;o clearly repre&s;ented be|fore Chri&s;t actually came in the Fle&s;h, yet the People of God had &s;uch Intimations of the glorious Redeemer as were &s;ufficient for their Tru&s;t in him. All Things that were then nece&s;&s;ary for Salvation were &s;o plainly revealed in the Old Te&s;tament, that our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf teaches, that tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to hear and obey Mo|&s;es and the Prophets, would not have repented, tho' one had been &s;ent from the dead to preach to them. "Search the Scriptures," was Chri&s;t's Direction. "It is written in the Scriptures," was a deci&s;ive Proof with the Apo&s;tles. The Scriptures are &s;aid by the Apo&s;tle Paul, <Q>to be able to make Men wi&s;e unto Salvation, thro' Faith which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q></P>
<P>Two Things plainly follow from what has been now proved.</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is not an ab&s;urd Thing to bapti&s;t the Infants of Chri&s;tian Parents under the Go&s;pel. Circumci&s;ion the Rite of Admi&s;&s;ion into the vi&s;ible Church is changed into Bapti&s;m. But &s;ince the Covenant is the &s;ame, Infants may be vi&s;ibly taken into it, under the Go&s;pel, as well as they were under the Law.</P>
<P N="2">2. The written Word of God contains all In&s;tructions nece&s;|&s;ary to our Salvation. If the Scriptures of the Old Te&s;tament were &s;ufficient for the Jews, it would be very ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that the written Word of God which we now have, when the In|&s;tructions of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles are added to tho&s;e of Mo|&s;es and the Prophets; and when Life and Immortality are more
<PB N="14" REF="009120_0017_1030F8D431F231A0">
clearly bro't to Light by the Go&s;pel, and the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, does not contain all Things nece&s;&s;ary for Salvation.</P>
<P>The Evangeli&s;ts profe&s;s to write THE GOSPEL of Chri&s;t, and who, that firmly believes they were divinely in&s;pired, can doubt whether they have done it &s;ufficiently? Was not the immediate In&s;piration of the Spirit granted unto them, to lead them to a perfect Remembrance of the Go&s;pel Hi&s;tory them&s;elves, that they &s;hould not commit any Mi&s;take in their In&s;tructions; and to enable them to communicate, and write them to others with &s;ufficient plainne&s;s? Who dare &s;ay, that the in&s;pired Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t have not faithfully recorded, what&s;oever he commanded them in the New Te&s;tament?</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle John plainly appears to to have wrote his Go&s;pel as a Supplement to the other three. <NOTE N="&s;" PLACE="foot">See Doddridge, on the Time of writing the Hi&s;torical Books.</NOTE> We are informed by the Fathers, who lived in the fir&s;t Ages of Chri&s;tianity, and who&s;e Te&s;timony is of great Weight in this Ca&s;e, that he wrote it in extream Old Age, very near the Conclu&s;ion of the fir&s;t Century. He was undoubtedly the la&s;t of the in&s;pired Writers. He bears the following Te&s;timony to the &s;ufficiency of the written Word. <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">John xx. 30, 31.</NOTE> <Q>Many other Signs truly did Je&s;us in the Pre&s;ence of his Di&s;|ciples, which are not written in this Book; but the&s;e are writ|ten that ye might believe that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, and that be|lieving ye might have Life thro' his Name.</Q> Thus according to the Apo&s;tle John's Account, which he wrote by the imme|diate in&s;piration of the Holy Spirit, all Things nece&s;&s;ary to Faith and eternal Life, are to be found in the written Word.</P>
<P>Now if the Scriptures be a &s;ufficient Rule, if they contain a Revelation which teaches us all Things nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, to Faith and Practice, and that in a Manner &s;ufficiently plain; there can be no Need of the Traditions of Papi&s;ts, the infalibility of the Pope; nor of the immediate Revelations of Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, to direct us in our Conduct.</P>
<P N="2">2. But I mu&s;t now proceed another Step, namely, that <HI>the Scriptures are &s;uch a perfect Rule, that we are to expect no further Re|velations and Directions relating to Religion.</HI> God has given us the <HI>whole</HI> Revelation of his Will, which he de&s;igns for our religious In&s;truction, in the Scriptures.</P>
<P>The Writers of the New Te&s;tament evidently prove this by
<PB N="15" REF="009120_0017_1030F8D431F231A0">
their frequent Appeals to the Old Te&s;tament, and their own Writings, as the only Standard or Te&s;t of Truth and Error <Q>If any Man, <HI>&s;ays the Apo&s;tle Paul,</HI> think him&s;elf to be a Pro|phet or &s;piritual, let him acknowledge that the Things which I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord</Q> <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiv. 37.</NOTE> The Apo&s;tle <NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. iii. 1, 2,&mdash;15.</NOTE> Peter recommends his beloved Brother Paul's Epi&s;|tles; and in the la&s;t Epi&s;tle which he him&s;elf wrote a little before his Death, he exhorts the Churches <Q>to be mindful of the Words which were &s;poken before by the holy Prophets, and of the Commandments of us the Apo&s;tles of the Lord and Saviour.</Q> "We are of God," <HI>&s;ays the Apo&s;tle John,</HI> <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">1 John, iv. 6.</NOTE> <Q>He that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us: Hereby know we the Spirit of Truth and the Spi|rit of Error.</Q> Since therefore, the&s;e Writers, who were in|&s;pired by the Holy Gho&s;t, thus plainly a&s;&s;ert the Perfection of their own Writings, as the only Te&s;t of Truth and Error, and appeal to them in Conjunction with the old Te&s;tament; this affords full Proof, and clear Evidence, that the Scriptures of the Old and New Te&s;tament, contain all the Revelations which God de&s;igned to give Mankind relative to their religious Duty.</P>
<P>It has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that this is one Thing which is intima|ted in tho&s;e remarkable Words of Chri&s;t, which are at the Clo&s;e of the la&s;t Book of the Bible, <Q>I te&s;tify unto every Man that heareth the Words of the Prophecy of this Book, if any Man &s;hall add unto the&s;e Things, God &s;hall add unto him the Plagues that are written in this Book. And if any Man &s;hall take away from the Words of the Book of this Prophe&s;y, God &s;hall take away his Part out of the Book of Life.</Q></P>
<P N="1">1 Ob. But does not God promi&s;e thus? <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah lix. 21.

<P>An&s;. God does not &s;ay in this Text, that he would put his Words in their Mouths in an immediate Way. You have no Right to add to his Words. Why may not God refer in this Promi&s;e to his putting his Words in Men's Mouths by Means of the

Scriptures, which were written by the In&s;piration of the Spirit, and which are by Way of Eminency the Word of God? Does not the Spirit of God al&s;o put his Words in the Hearts and Mouths of Sinners by his convincing and &s;anctifying Influences, &s;etting divine Truth home on their Con&s;ciences? Since there|fore what is promi&s;ed here may be fully performed in the&s;e other ordinary Ways, without immediate Revelation; I don't &s;ee how this Text can be any Thing to your Purpo&s;e. Your Conclu&s;i|on from this Text, that it mu&s;t be immediate, is ju&s;t like his Rea&s;oning in the Play; who, as &s;oon as he heard that Pamphilus was not to have Glycerium for his Wife, inferred he mu&s;t have her him&s;elf, as if there had been no other Men in the World.</P>
<P N="2">2 Ob. But has not Chri&s;t promi&s;ed in the New Te&s;tament, <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">John xvi. 26.</NOTE> to his Di&s;ciples, that <Q>the Comforter or Holy Gho&s;t &s;hall teach them all Things; and bring all Things to their Re|membrance!</Q></P>
<P>An&s;. Chri&s;t had chiefly a Referrence to his Apo&s;tles in this Pa&s;&s;age. He was &s;peaking to them &mdash;As he &s;ent them to preach the Go&s;pel to all Nations, to an ignorant and malicious World; and appointed them to write the New Te&s;tament for the In&s;truc|tion of Mankind, and the Edification of his Church in all &s;uc|ceeding Ages; &s;o the immediate Teachings and In&s;pirations of the Spirit, were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for them.</P>
<P>So far as this Text refers to Chri&s;tians in general, it may be very rea&s;onably interpreted of the Spirit's improving the written Word, in his convincing, inlightening and &s;anctifying Influences. But if any will pretend that the Spirit teaches them all Things, and brings all Things to their Remembrance, now, in an imme|diate Way; I would remind &s;uch, that we are informed by St. John, that there were many other Things which Je&s;us did, be|&s;ides tho&s;e that were written. Pray reveal &s;ome of tho&s;e Things, which are not written in the Bible to the World. Daniel and his Companions actually revealed Nebuchadnezzar's Dream to him.</P>
<P>When God gives immediate Revelations and Directions to Men, he gives &s;ome Evidence, which is &s;ufficient, if duly attend|ed to and examined, to prove that &s;uch Revelations come from him as their true Original. This is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince
<PB N="17" REF="009120_0018_1030F8D76C8BFDE0">
there is a fal&s;e Spirit who makes it his grand Bu&s;ine&s;s to deceive.

<P>"The Word &s;poken by Angels," <HI>&s;ays the Apo&s;tle,</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 2.</NOTE> <Q>was &s;teadfa&s;t, and every Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and Di&s;obedience received a ju&s;t Recompence of Reward.</Q> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Doct.

<P>Divine Revelation is &s;teadfa&s;t in Re&s;pect of them unto whom it is &s;poken being the Foundation of Faith and Obedience; the formal Rea&s;on of them, and the la&s;t Ground whereunto they are re&s;olved&mdash;On the Part of God, it is a &s;table and &s;ufficient Ground of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, in proceeding to take Vengeance on them, by whom it is neglected. The Puni&s;hment of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, is a meet Recompence of Reward, becau&s;e the Word &s;poken unto them is &s;teadfa&s;t. If the Revelation be not a &s;table, firm Founda|tion for the Faith and Obedience of Men, they cannot be ju&s;tly puni&s;hed for the Neglect of it. There mu&s;t then be &s;ome Evi|dence which &s;ufficiently proves a Revelation to be from God; otherwi&s;e he could not be ju&s;t in puni&s;hing them for di&s;regarding it, &s;ince on &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition he would puni&s;h them for not be|lieving <HI>that</HI> which he gave them no &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to believe which &s;uits not with the Holine&s;s and Ju&s;tice of God.</P>
<P>This Pa&s;&s;age of Holy Scripture not only &s;hews that immediate Revelations mu&s;t be recommended by &s;ufficient Evidence to Man|kind; but it al&s;o expre&s;sly declares what this &s;ufficient Evidence is, which confirms the Truth of new Revelations. This whole emphatical Pa&s;&s;age is an Inference from what the Apo&s;tle had di&s;cour&s;ed about the Excellencies of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the fir&s;t Chapter, and runs thus. <Q>Therefore we ought to give the more earne&s;t Heed to the Things which we have heard, le&s;t at any Time we &s;hould let them &s;lip. For if the Word &s;poken by

Angles was &s;teadfa&s;t, and every Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and Di&s;obedience received a ju&s;t Recompence of Reward; how &s;hall we e&s;cape if we neglect &s;o great a Salvation, which at the fir&s;t began to be &s;poken by the Lord, <HI>and</HI> was confirmed unto us by them that heard <HI>him;</HI> God al&s;o bearing them Witne&s;s, both with Signs and Wonders and with divers Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, according to his Will?</Q></P>
<P>The Word here &s;poken by Angels means the Law of Mo&s;es. The Phra&s;e, <HI>Great Salvation,</HI> which is placed in Contra&s;t or Op|po&s;ition, means the Go&s;pel. Interpreters ob&s;erve, that the Go&s;|pel is called Salvation by a Metonymy of the Effect for the Cau&s;e, being the Revelation of the Grace of God, that bringeth Salvation; the Word that is able to &s;ave us.</P>
<P>God bore Witne&s;s to the Truth of this Revelation, not merely by &s;trong Impul&s;es, but by Signs, Wonders and Miracles, &amp;c. Thus we are a&s;&s;ured, that Miracles, publick Miracles are the Evi|dence and Seal which God gave to the Truth of the New Te&s;|tament. And the Old was confirmed in the &s;ame Manner. Mo|&s;es proved the Truth of his Revelations in Oppo&s;ition to the Magicians, and Korah and his Company by inconte&s;tible Mira|cles. And Miracles were the Te&s;t, by which Elijah tried, and confounded the fal&s;e Prophets, who pretended to Revelations in his Days. Whoever therefore pretends to new Revelations; whoever would a&s;&s;ume a Power of making new Terms of Com|munion, be&s;ides tho&s;e contained in the Scriptures, mu&s;t work proper Miracles in the Face of the World; otherwi&s;e their Re|velations and Prophe&s;ies; their un&s;criptural Terms of Communi|on may be &s;afely rejected becau&s;e de&s;titute of God's Seal.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons and Churches can attain to no higher Degrees of Re|formation and Purity, than &s;incerely to believe, and practi&s;e the Directions God has given us in the Bible. All pretences to any Thing beyond&mdash;to any Thing be&s;ides this divine Rule in Matters of Religion are vain and impious. Hence all new Reve|lations, let who will pretend to them; all new Terms of Commu|nion, let who will invent them, yea tho' Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil Power &s;hould join in Alliance to impo&s;e them with the greate&s;t Rigour, are to be rejected. Chri&s;tians &s;hould regard and obey nothing as divine, till it is proved to proceed from God by pro|per Miracles. The heated Fancies of Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and the Pre|&s;umptions and Impo&s;itions of zealous and per&s;ecuting Bigots, af|ford

no &s;ufficient Warrant for our Faith. They are equally groundle&s;s, and &s;hould be di&s;regard by all who profe&s;s to be the Followers of Chri&s;t. Human Authority and Number of Men are of no Weight here. Nothing but Miracles will prove Direc|tions for our religious Conduct to be divine.</P>
<P>God has not &s;et his Seal of Miracles to any other Revelation relative to Salvation and our ordinary Duty; but that contained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in the Bible. If therefore Chri&s;tians will receive for divine, any Revelation which has not God's Seal upon it; if they will &s;ubmit to any un&s;criptural Impo&s;itions of Men, they may thank them&s;elves for being deceived. Let them, in all Matters relating to Salvation, follow no Impul&s;es and Revelations; no Teachings and Inventions of Men, by whom&s;oever devi&s;ed and impo&s;ed, but tho&s;e contained in the Bible, or which may be derived from it by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">air Con&s;equences; and this will be an excellent Pre&s;ervative again&s;t Delu&s;ions. No Revelations are to be looked for, and de|pended on to direct us in our Conduct, but tho&s;e delivered in the Scriptures; &s;ince God has confirmed and recommended the&s;e, and only the&s;e, by proper Miracles, which are his Witne&s;s, Mark, Evidence and Seal.</P>
<P N="3">3 But tho' God has given Mankind all the Directions for their Conduct in his written Word, which they are to expect; this does not &s;uperlede the Nece&s;&s;ity of the inward Work of the Spirit on their Hearts, in Order to bring them to be &s;incere|ly religious. There is no &s;ufficient Evidence to induce us to believe, that Sinners become religious, <HI>merely</HI> by Dint of their own Application to Duty; as Scholars learn Reading, Writing or Mathematicks, by clo&s;e Application to Study. Indeed the Scrip|tures repre&s;ent Men as being indifferent, or rather aver&s;e to &s;eek after God.

<P>The remarkable Succe&s;s of the Go&s;pel at fir&s;t is at once a glorious Proof of the Divine Truth of Chri&s;tianity, and of the internal Operations of the Spirit on the Souls of true Converts&mdash; The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t according to the Fle&s;h was of the Jewi&s;h Nation, which was hated by the Gentile World for &s;undry Rea|&s;ons.

He appeared in &s;uch low Circum&s;tances that his own Nation took Umbrage at his pretending to be their Me&s;&s;iah, and put him to Death as an Impo&s;ter and Bla&s;phemer. After his Death, the greate&s;t Part of the Jews &s;till approved of their Conduct, reproaching him to the utmo&s;t. They took every Method they could devi&s;e, to prevent his Di&s;ciples from preaching in his Name.</P>
<P>The Gentile Nations as they hated the Jews, and were ready to be immediately prejudiced agin&s;t any Doctrine which any of them &s;hould advance; &s;o they had lo&s;t all rational Ideas about God, having from Time immemorial apo&s;tati&s;ed from his Wor|&s;hip to that of their decea&s;ed Heroes and Idol Deities. And as Mankind are greatly bya&s;&s;ed by their Education, and early Connexions, ready to imitate their Parents, ond &s;trongly preju|diced in Favour of Cu&s;toms, Habits and religious Ceremonies, which they receive from their Ance&s;tors; &s;o the Heathen Na|tions were mo&s;t firmly attached, and violently bigotted to the Religion profe&s;&s;ed in their re&s;pective Countries. They were in|&s;tantly fired again&s;t any that &s;hould affront their Gods: yea ready to ri&s;que their Lives as well as E&s;tates in Defence of their Religion. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Jer. ii. 10, 11.</NOTE> "Pa&s;s over," <HI>&s;ays the Lord by his Prophet,</HI> <Q>the I&s;les of Chittem and &s;ee; and &s;end unto K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dar, and con&s;ider diligently, and &s;ee if there be any &s;uch Thing.

the Gentile Nations profe&s;&s;ed, in one or two Points; but was contrary to all the religious Sy&s;tems then in the World, in the mo&s;t material Things. And it was equally contrary to the na|tural Temper of Mankind, to their corrupt Inclinations and &s;inful Practices. It was a Religion every where &s;poken again&s;t.</P>
<P>The chief Prie&s;ts and Elders of the Jewi&s;h Nation were not more zealous again&s;t the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, than the Grandees of the Gentile World.&mdash;Their Orators harangued again&s;t it; their Poets &s;atyri&s;ed and bantered the Chri&s;tians, for wor&s;hiping a crucified God. And the Civil Powers exerted their Autho|rity in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing and per&s;ecuting them to Death. Chri&s;tians were actually put to Death by Thou&s;ands at Rome, in the mo&s;t barbarous Manner, and wherever they could be found, for a Ter|ror to prevent others from embracing their Religion. Yet this new Sy&s;tem, this Go&s;pel of Je&s;us of Nazareth who was crucified; this Scheme that was &s;o contrary to all the religious Notions and Cu&s;toms, which they had learned from their Parents, had recei|ved from remote Antiquity, and to which they them&s;elves had always been habituated; this Go&s;pel, that was &s;o contrary to the natural Inclinations, and vicious Practices of Mankind, dai|ly &s;pread and prevailed, conquered their Prejudicies, triumphed over all Oppo&s;itions; and in proce&s;s of Time &s;ubdued the large Roman Empire. The Emperors them&s;elves became obedient to the Faith of Chri&s;t. To whom is this to be a&s;cribed?</P>
<P>The chief Per&s;ons employed in effecting this &s;urpri&s;ing Revo|lution were twelve Fi&s;her-men of the de&s;pi&s;ed Jewi&s;h Nation. One Saul who had been a violent Per&s;ecutor joined him&s;elf to them, and became a Preacher. But the Moment he became a Di&s;ciple of Je&s;us of Nazareth, he lo&s;t his Influence with his for|mer Friends. His Power and Inclination to per&s;ecute for&s;ook him at the &s;ame In&s;tant.</P>
<P>As the Apo&s;tles were not bro't up in Courts but were plain Fi&s;her-men, their Succe&s;s was not owing to their being fine Gen|tlemen, or the Arts of flattering In&s;inuations. If they had been furni&s;hed with &s;ufficient Learning and Skill, or been Men of po|lite Breeding and ea&s;y Manners; they were &s;o poor in the World, having for&s;aken that little they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of its Riches at the Com|mand of their Lord and Ma&s;ter, that they could never have put &s;uch Methods in Practice.</P>

<P>As the Apo&s;tles were poor, and de&s;titute of worldly Power, they were naturally fearful and timerous, and <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Witne&s;s their cowardly for&s;aking their Ma&s;ter when he was apprehended and Peter's denying him thro' Fear.</NOTE> of Con&s;equence did not &s;ubdue the Nations by Force of Arms, and then oblige them to embrace their Religion, like the Romans, and Mahometans.

<P>It is true indeed, that God wro't many glorious Miracles by the Apo&s;tles. The&s;e were nece&s;&s;ary to prove that the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t which they preached was from God; and that they were im|mediately called to that Office.

the Scribes and Phari&s;ees. They were fully informed by the Soldiers of that mo&s;t glorious Miracle of his ri&s;ing from the dead. This &s;urpri&s;ed, but did not convert them. They immediately determined to bribe the Soldiers to mi&s;repre&s;ent the Fact. They &s;aw the glorious Miracles which the Apo&s;tles wro't to prove that Je&s;us of Nazareth was the very Chri&s;t, yet the greate&s;t Part of them ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in their Unbelief, and per&s;ecuted his Di&s;ciples with unrelenting Malice and Rage. Indeed if the Jews, like Nicodemus, had candidly examined the Miracles which were wro't, they might with him have been convinced that Je&s;us of Nazareth was the true Me&s;&s;ias. But Men are &s;eldom di&s;po&s;ed to be candid, when a Change of their old Religion is propo&s;ed. There are but few Men, who will be at the Pains, if left merely to them&s;elves, carefully to examine Religion. Now Miracles mu&s;t be examined, and their Reality and Certainty cleared from all ju&s;t Su&s;picions of Impo&s;ture, before they can convince the Judgment. And if they were ever &s;o candidly at|tended to, they could not change and &s;anctify Men's Hearts. The Evangeli&s;t John ob&s;erves, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">John xii. 37, 38.</NOTE> that tho' <Q>Chri&s;t had done &s;o many Miracles before the Jews, yet they believed not on him.</Q> Now were not the Jews as likely to be influenced by the Miracles of Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles who were of their own Nation as the prejudiced Gentiles? Had the Heathens &s;o much more Candour and diligent Attention than the Jews, who from their great religious Advantages were va&s;tly &s;uperior to them? While the Evangeli&s;t laments over the Unbelief of the Jews who &s;aw Chri&s;t's Miracles, he a&s;cribes true Faith to a divine Agen|cy on the Souls of Men. <Q>Lord who hath believed our Report? and to whom hath the Arm of the Lord been revealed?</Q> Could any Thing le&s;s than a divine Power on the Heart bring ignorant, ungodly, debauched Heathens to be eminently holy Saints?</P>
<P>The Go&s;pel is indeed a mo&s;t rea&s;onable and excellent Scheme, full of the fine&s;t Sentiments, and the mo&s;t weighty Arguments. But had the Spread of Chri&s;tianity in the World been owing merely to the external Evidences of the Go&s;pel, the Ju&s;tne&s;s of the Sentiments or the excellent Rea&s;onings contained in it; then, one would think, Chri&s;t &s;hould have cho&s;en &s;ome great Orators, like Ci|cero and Demo&s;thenes, to have preached to the World, who would

<P>The Apo&s;tles repeatedly refer this memorable Revolution which was bro't about by their Preaching to a much higher and nobler Cau&s;e than human Eloquence. They a&s;&s;ure us, that however powerful and captivating the Charms of Oratory may be, they were not employed in effecting this glorious Change. Who &s;hould know to whom this wonderful Succe&s;s of the Go&s;pel in the Heathen World was to be a&s;cribed, &s;o well as Paul, the famous Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, the chief In&s;trument of their Con|ver&s;ion?

<P>Thus the Apo&s;tle Paul (as al&s;o the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles) in the mo&s;t expre&s;s Words, in &s;undry Pa&s;&s;ages of his Writings, plainly a&s;cribes the Succe&s;s of the Go&s;pel to the internal Agency of God on the Minds of Mer. And if the Apo&s;tles had been much le&s;s expre&s;s in pointing us to the Spirit of God, no Man, that &s;hould candidly con&s;ider how great the Authority of Parents is with their Children; how difficult it is to per&s;uade Mankind, ho|ne&s;tly to enquire into the Evidences of that Religion which they receive from their Ance&s;tors; how ea&s;ily they learn Habits in their early Years; how &s;trongly they are prejudiced in Favour of Religious Cu&s;toms to which they have once been habituated; how jealous they are about making any great Change; as al&s;o how little Influence Miracles had on the Jews; would ea&s;ily give into it, that the &s;udden Conver&s;ion of the Gentiles, to Chri&s;tianity and Holine&s;s, in Oppo&s;ition to all the&s;e Prejudices, and to all temporal Advantages, could not have been effected without &s;ome internal Operations on their Hearts. It was &s;urely God's own Almighty Arm that bro't about &s;uch a glorious Revolution, by &s;uch weak In&s;truments; and by &s;uch unlikely Means, as the Fooli&s;hne&s;s of Preaching.</P>
<P>The Gentiles were devoted, even to the Height of Bigotry and Super&s;tition, to the Service of their Idol Deities; and they were likewi&s;e &s;unk into the lowe&s;t Depths of Vice and Debauche|ry, when Chri&s;t &s;ent his Apo&s;tles to preach this Go&s;pel to them.

God accompanied their Preaching with the pow|erful Influences of his Spirit, on the Souls of their Hearers. In a few Years, many Thou&s;ands, in various Parts of the World, became as ominent for Virtue and Religion, as they had been before notorious for their &s;candalous Vices and Debaucheries.

<P>As you look for immediate Revelations and Impul&s;es, &s;o ma|ny of you are extremely confident you actually have them, and that not only your pre&s;ent Duty, but &s;undry future Events are revealed to you by the Spirit or Saviour. It was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate your Opinions on this Point, thus largely, that the World may not be impo&s;ed on by your &s;pecious Pretences; and that all may clearly &s;ee what I di&s;pute again&s;t.</P>
<P>Your Notions plainly &s;uppo&s;e, that the Scriptures are not &s;uf|ficient to teach you your Duty, and that God actually grants new Revelation; both which I have clearly demon&s;trated to be fal&s;e, and of Con&s;equence, I have intirely undermined the Foun|dation of your whole Scheme. Therefore I would advi&s;e you, carefully to review what I have &s;aid on the&s;e two Points.</P>
<P>But though I have &s;aid quite enough to &s;atisfy the more intel|ligent Reader, I find it nece&s;&s;ary, for the In&s;truction of others, to explain &s;omewhat largely, how the Scriptures are quite &s;uffi|cient to direct Men in particular Ca&s;es, their Minds being duly illuminated by the Spirit of God, that I may effectually overthrow all your Pretences and Pleas.</P>
<P N="1">1. You readily allow that Mankind are rational Creatures, endowed with the Powers of Con&s;cience, Reflection, Memory and Rea&s;oning. If Men had no Con&s;cience they would not be Moral Agents. If they had no Memory, they could not be be|nefitted by Revelation or any Kind: For what is not remembred cannot be a Rule of Conduct. This being granted, it will be ea&s;y to conceive, how the Scriptures come to refer to us in par|ticular, and to an&s;wer our particular Ca&s;es.&mdash;They are given to Mankind in general, in every Country, and in every Age, where they are &s;ent. The Laws and Truths, which they contain, don't re&s;pect particular Per&s;ons as &s;uch, but as they belong to general Characters, Ranks or Sorts, that are in&s;tructed, exhorted, re|proved, comforted, &amp;c. You are not mentioned by Name in the Laws of England, nor in the Laws of this Colony; yet if
<PB N="30" REF="009120_0025_1030F8EAD8D8FA28">
you violate them, and Proof is made, they are found to have a peculiar Reference to you. Can you comprehend this? If you can, you need be at no Lo&s;s to under&s;tand, how the general Directions and Truths in the Scriptures refer to you, in particu|lar, even as you belong to &s;ome general Character or Sort of Per&s;ons. For the Scriptures are given to Mankind in general, ju&s;t as the Laws of a Kingdom or Colony to all the Subjects be|longing to it, to one as much as another.</P>
<P>This Ob&s;ervation is &s;o important that I would not by any Means have it mi&s;under&s;tood, and &s;hall therefore add &s;ome Ex|amples to render it quite plain. When the third Command forbids Swearing, it has no more Reference to <HI>Robert</HI> than to <HI>Gilbert,</HI> no more Reference to them, than to any other Men. And thus the Law of the Colony again&s;t Swearing refers to all equally alike, forbidding one as much as another. It is &s;o like|wi&s;e in the Declarations, Promi&s;es and Threatnings of the Go&s;|pel. Thus for In&s;tance, <Q>He that believeth and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved; but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</Q> 'Tis not a Man's Name being John, or James, but his Cha|racter, his being a Believer or an Unbeliever, that determines whe|ther the Promi&s;e or the Threatning belongs to him in particular.</P>
<P>If the Scriptures had been de&s;igned, not for Mankind in ge|neral, but for particular Per&s;ons as &s;uch, there mu&s;t have been a di&s;tinct Bible for every Individual. Now we know God has granted but one Bible to Mankind, which is therefore the gene|ral or common Bible to the whole Chri&s;tian World.</P>
<P>Even tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, which give us an Account of particular Per&s;ons, &s;o far as they are appointed for our direct In&s;truction, can only teach us general Truths. The Per&s;ons to whom they had an immediate Reference are dead, and they can't have this par|ticular Reference to any other Per&s;on, for this plain Rea&s;on, that<NOTE PLACE="foot">Since I wrote the above Sentiments, I have the Plea&s;ure to find, that Doct. Doddridge has &s;tated the Matter in the &s;ame Light in his Note on 2 Pet. iii. 15. <Q>Our beloved Paul al&s;o according to the Wi&s;dom given unto him hath writ|ten unto you.</Q> I look (&s;ays the Doct.) on this Pa&s;&s;age, as a very in&s;tructive Ad|monition to <HI>all</HI> Chri&s;tians to con&s;ider St. Paul, and the other Apo&s;tles as writing <HI>to them</HI> in their Epi&s;tles, &s;o far as a Similarity of Circum&s;tances would permit. In which View it is of infinite Importance, that we &s;hould con&s;ider them as written <HI>to us</HI> in like Manner as St. <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, even the ancient Prophets con|&s;idered the great Subjects of which the&s;e Epi&s;tles treat as relating to them 1 Pet. i. 12.</NOTE> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Mark xvi. 16.</NOTE>

different Per&s;ons are not the &s;ame. Now when the&s;e peculiar Circum&s;tances are drop't they have like other Scriptures a general Reference to all.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e a profane Swearer convinced of his awful Sin, by the Spirit of God from the third Command, or the In&s;tance of <HI>Shelomith's</HI> Son who was &s;toned to Death for this Sin. <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Lev. xxiv. 10.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.23.</NOTE> This Command and Example have a general and equal Reference to all. The Spirt of God in this Ca&s;e impre&s;&s;es the general Truth contained in them, on the Man's Con&s;cience, and refre&s;hes his Memory, that he remembers at &s;uch and &s;uch Times, he violated this excellent Precept. He &s;ees he is guilty, and can't but apply the general Truth and the dread|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l Threatning to his own particular Ca&s;e. Thus the Spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed convinces Man of their Sins, whatever they are, from general Truths &s;et home on the Con&s;ciences, and thus applied to particular Ca&s;es. I appeal to the Experience of all convinced Sinners.</P>
<P>Thus it is al&s;o in Conver&s;ion. While Men's Minds are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and their Hearts hardened thro' the Deceitfulne&s;s of Sin, they have very wrong Thoughts of God. But when the Holy Spirit enlightens their Minds, by Manife&s;tation of the Truth to their Con&s;ciences, the general Truths which are con|tained in the Scriptures about God, &amp;c. they get &s;ome ju&s;ter Apprehen&s;ions of him, his Holy Law, and the mi&s;erable Con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, to which their breaking this excellent Rule has reduced them. This is <HI>Law-Work</HI> or Conviction.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Spirit, having taught them about God, his Law, their Expo&s;edne&s;s to his Wrath, brings them to know effec|tually the general Truths of the Go&s;pel, in their eminent Glo|ry. The Sinner then beholds God to be &s;uch a glorious Be|ing as the Scriptures de&s;cribe him con&s;idered in him&s;elf; while he views his Perfections unitedly di&s;played and glorified in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <Q>God, <HI>&s;ays the Apo&s;tle,</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv. 6.</NOTE> hath &s;hined in our Hearts, to give the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Je&s;us.</Q> &mdash;His Objections in&s;tantly vani&s;h, he now &s;ees that <Q>God can be ju&s;t, and the Ju&s;tifier of him that believeth in Je&s;us.</Q> It is a general Truth and worthy of all Acceptation, that "Chri&s;t Je&s;us came to &s;ave Sinners," even the chief

of Sinners, and that "he will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out any that cometh unto him." On the&s;e or the like general Truths, Sinners are encouraged to believe in Chri&s;t. The Truths contained in the Scriptures are the Foundation, on which true Believers build their Hopes; the general Truths, which always were and always will be in the Scriptures. They are <HI>eminently</HI> Believers, becau&s;e they effectually believe or receive the Te&s;timo|ny or Record, which God has borne to his Son in the Go&s;pel. So that there is no Need of any new Revelation here.</P>
<P>As the Faith of true Believers is founded at fir&s;t on the Divine Te&s;timony contained in the written Word; &s;o their Encrea&s;e in this Faith and Growth in Grace is by the &s;ame Word. They love God's Law, and meditate on his Word; and thus the Spirit of God giving them to &s;ee the excellent Beauty and real Glory, which is in the Scriptures, that is in divine Things as repre&s;ented there, they grow in Grace and in the Knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <Q>Trough him we have Acce&s;s by the Spi|rit<NOTE PLACE="foot">Of all Truths which People &s;hould welcome and &s;tudy, they &s;hould wel|come and &s;tudy tho&s;e that concern Chri&s;t, and the Covenant of Grace mo&s;t as Foundation Truths, and &s;eek to have them impre&s;&s;ed by the Spirit.

'Tis very &s;ad that Men are more taken up with Notions and Speculations than with &s;uch Soul &s;aving Truths as the&s;e; that Chri&s;t was born, that he was a true Man, that he was, and is King, Prie&s;t and Prophet of his Church, &amp;c. and that other Things are heard with more Greedine&s;s; but if the&s;e &s;hould be the great Subject of Mini&s;ters Preaching, it &s;hould be your great Study to know Chri&s;t in his Per&s;on, Natures, Offices and Covenant; what he is to you, and what is your Duty to him, and how you &s;hould walk in him, and with him: This was Paul's Aim, I count, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> all Things Lo&s;s and Dung for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Chri&s;t, that I may know him and the Power of his Re&s;urrection, and the Fellow&s;hip of his Sufferings, &amp;c.

Therefore on the one Side let me exhort you to make this more the Subject of your Enquiry; and on the other Side take it for your Reproof that there is &s;uch a Readine&s;s to &s;nuff [to be offen|ded &amp; di&s;&s;atisfied] when plain Truths are in&s;i&s;ted on, or when they are not fol|lowed to &s;ome uncouth or &s;trange Way, which &s;ays, we are exceeding unthank|ful to God, for giving us the be&s;t Things to &s;peak, hear and think of.

<P N="2">2. The Temper and Character of true Saints is largely and plainly de&s;cribed in the Scriptures, and God has endowed Men with the Principle of Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and Reflection, by which they may know their pa&s;t Experiences and pre&s;ent Temper. There is no Need then of any new Revelations to inform them about their pre&s;ent State. The only Que&s;tion here is, <Q>Have you this Temper and Character which the Scriptures declare belongs to all true Saints?</Q> The Scripture-Di|rection in this Ca&s;e is not, <Q>Look for an immediate Reve|lation to a&s;&s;ure you, that you are in a State of Grace," but <NOTE N="&s;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xiii. 5.</NOTE> Examine your&s;elves, whether ye be in the Faith, prove your own &s;elves, know ye not your own &s;elves, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is in you, except ye be Reprobates." "The&s;e Things, <HI>&s;ays the Apo&s;tle John,</HI> <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 13.</NOTE> have I written unto you that believe on the Name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal Life, and that ye may believe on the Name of the Son of God.</Q></P>
<P>Ob. But what is meant by the Witne&s;s of the Spirit? Rom. viii. 16.</P>
<P>An&s;. It is not &s;aid, that the Spirit bears Witne&s;s to Men by <HI>revealing</HI> to them <HI>immediately,</HI> that they are in a State of Favour with God, or in the Number of his peculiar Children; nor can any &s;uch Thing be fairly inferred from the Text. If this had been the Way Chri&s;tians came to know their good E&s;tate, why did the Apo&s;tle give, even in this Chapter, &s;o many Marks and Characters of true Saints?</P>
<P>As to the Meaning of the Text, ob&s;erve the Apo&s;tle had a&s;&s;erted in this Chapter, that tho&s;e <Q>who walked after the Spirit, in whom he dwelt, and who were led by him,</Q> yield|ing to his &s;weet Influences and obeying his Word, <Q>were the Sons of God.</Q> That in Con&s;equence of this high Relation, they were delivered from a guilty &s;lavi&s;h Temper, and had re|ceived
<PB N="34" REF="009120_0027_1030F8EFFAAEFAD0">
the Spirit of Adoption or the Di&s;po&s;ition of Children; "Whereby, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we cry Abba Father." Thus their Spirits or Con&s;ciences, being delivered from the Guilt of Sin, and the &s;ervile Yoke of the Mo&s;aick Laws and ceremonial In&s;titutions by Chri&s;t, acted with the Freedom of Children, and bore Wit|ne&s;s that they were the Adopted Sons of God. Then follow the&s;e Words, <Q>The Spirit it&s;elf beareth Witne&s;s with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God.</Q> That is, the Spi|rit of God te&s;tifies, bears Witne&s;s in his written Word, that tho&s;e who are led by the Spirit and have a filial Temper are the Children of God. And thus the Spirit of God joins with the well enlighten'd Con&s;cience of true Chri&s;tians, and te&s;tifies that they are the Children of God Thus the Spirit of God joins with the Con&s;cience of wicked Men under Convicti|ons, and, bears Witne&s;s that they are not his Children, but expo&s;ed to his Wrath. Or the Meaning of the Text may be, the Spirit bears Witne&s;s that we are the Children of God, by the Graces which he works in us, which are his Seal, Mark, Evidence or Witne&s;s.</P>
<P>But if any will &s;till maintain, that they have had immediate Revelations to a&s;&s;ure them of their gracious State; let them work Miracles to prove their Revelations came from God; otherwi&s;e, let them know they are in Danger of tru&s;ting their eternal Salvation on a Delu&s;ion of Satan. It may perhaps be of &s;ome Service to &s;ome to inform them, that it is the Opinion of the Papi&s;ts, and was confirmed by the Council of Trent, as may be &s;een at large in the &s;ixth Se&s;&s;ion, that <Q>no Man can ever know he is in a State of Grace, in this Life, unle&s;s it be &s;pecially revealed to him by God.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. To proceed to another In&s;tance, God has revealed by his Spirit in the Scriptures to Men, in general, that it is their Duty to pray frequently, to devote all convenient Opportunities to this important Exerci&s;e, and Rea&s;on teaches the &s;ame Thing. Con&s;equently every Man is directed to pray on all proper Oc|ca&s;ions, as really as if he was called upon by Name in an im|mediate Manner, &s;o that none need to be at a Lo&s;s for Directi|ons in this Point. You have no Need of a new Revelation to teach you, that you &s;hould pray; nor when you &s;hould; your own Con&s;cience and Rea&s;on, together with the general Directi|ons of God's written Word plainly teach you this. And if you
<PB N="35" REF="009120_0027_1030F8EFFAAEFAD0">
venture to re&s;train Prayer until you have it immediately reveal|ed to you by the Spirit; whenever your Con&s;ciences are duly awakened you'll clearly &s;ee the Weakne&s;s of your Pretences.&mdash; If a Man may not pray, till he is immediately called to this Duty by the Spirit; then he may not pray for the Influences of the Spirit, which is contrary to Chri&s;t's Direction. <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Luke xi. 1,&mdash;13.</NOTE> Then al&s;o it will be no Sin for him to neglect Prayer, a Notion which is very agreeable to the ungodly World, <NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Job xxi. 13.15. Mal. iii. 14.</NOTE> but quite contrary to the Scripture. And how &s;hould a Man know that &s;uch a Revalation came from God? Did God ever work any Miracles to prove the Truth of &s;uch a Revelation? May not the Devil have various Ends in &s;ugge&s;ting to Per&s;ons it is their Duty to pray, hereby leading them to neglect the plain written Word, and to look to him for Directions, when to perform this Duty. And will not Satan direct to very un&s;ea&s;onable Times.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Scriptures plainly tell what Sort of Men Bi&s;hops or Mini&s;ters &s;hould be. <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">See the Epi&s;tles to Timothy and Titus.</NOTE> Let a Man then examine him&s;elf whether he has the&s;e Qualifications. In the Multitude of Coun&s;ellors there is Safety. 'Tis not rea&s;onable that a Man &s;hould be the &s;ole Judge of his own Abilities and Qualifications. Hence, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has appointed tho&s;e who are already in the Mini&s;try to look out for &s;uitable Per&s;ons for the Service of the Churches. They are required to examine Candidates for the Mini&s;try, and judge of their Qualifications and Fitne&s;s for this Office. For every Man is allowed to be the be&s;t Judge of his own Occupation, Bu&s;ine&s;s or Calling. The Directions, then, to Mini&s;ters, which were immediately &s;ent to Timothy as a Mini&s;ter, are perfectly agreeable to common Sen&s;e, and are Methods of proceeding in other Affairs of Life. <Q>The Things which thou ha&s;t heard of me among many Wit|ne&s;&s;es, the &s;ame commit thou to faithful Men who &s;hall be able to reach others al&s;o.</Q> <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>A Candidate for the Mini&s;try, then, mu&s;t apply to the Mi|ni&s;ters to whom Chri&s;t has committed the Authority of exa|mining, judging and putting faithful Men into the Mini&s;try; and if they find him duly qualified, the Scriptures plainly di|rect him to proceed. And when &s;uch a Man is regularly cho|&s;en
<PB N="36" REF="009120_0028_1030F8F70BF6AEE0">
by the People; and ordained according to the Rules of God's Word; he is made a Bi&s;hop, Over&s;eer or Mini&s;ter, over &s;uch a People by the Holy Gho&s;t. For the Holy Gho&s;t has fitted him for this Office, being the Giver of his mini&s;terial Qualifications; and has given tho&s;e Rules or Directions in the written Word, according to which he has been fixed in his Pa&s;|toral Charge. So that there is no Need of any new Revelation in this Ca&s;e. All that is nece&s;&s;ary here is, that Men have their Minds duly enlightened and influenced by the Truths which the Holy Gho&s;t has revealed in the written Word.</P>
<P>If the Scriptures are perfect, what Need of any further Di|rections and Revelations? If the&s;e Ca&s;es, if Men's Duty in all ordinary Ca&s;es, be clearly revealed and pointed out in them, what Advantage could be received from a new Revelation? Would a new Direction about our Duty communicate any more Grace to us than the old one in the Bible? May not Men know their Duty, and yet not be willing to do it? Have there not been various In&s;tances among you, wherein Per&s;ons could not comply with your new Revelations, and thus you have been quite di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>Are not &s;ome di&s;gu&s;ted at the old Directions in the Bible, becau&s;e they are not agreeable to your pre&s;ent Inclination, as Ahab was at Micaiah; and long, with <HI>Balak,</HI> for a new Re|velation, hoping it will be more agreeable to your Fancies? But is not this to hope that God is changed? Perhaps &s;ome think they are &s;o eminent for their &s;hining Gifts and Graces, that it is beneath them to &s;tudy the Scriptures. Some are too indolent and lazy to &s;earch this &s;acred Book. They had rather have an immediate Revelation, or an Angel &s;ent from Heaven to in&s;truct them. But will God gratify Men's Pride and La|zine&s;s?</P>
<P>There is no Doubt but God can give immediate Revelations, and &s;end Angels from Heaven. But it is evidently contrary to his Wi&s;dom to do it, unle&s;s there was &s;ome Nece&s;&s;ity for it. If God has ever interpo&s;ed in &s;uch a very extraordinary Way, it was doubtle&s;s to an&s;wer &s;ome important End, which could not have been well obtained by the common In&s;tructions of the written Word The Light of Nature and the Rea&s;on of Things taught the Heathens, they were not to expect a God would in|terpo&s;e
<PB N="37" REF="009120_0028_1030F8F70BF6AEE0">

So that both common Sen&s;e and Scripture agree in teaching us, that God will not depart from his common Method of In&s;truction, un|le&s;s on &s;ome very extraordinary Occa&s;ion, to an&s;wer &s;ome very important End. But what is there that is extraordinary in your Ca&s;e? Or in the Ca&s;es of Chri&s;tians in general? If God has really given us a perfect Rule in his holy Word, we may be &s;ure that he will not &s;et it a&s;ide to gratify the Humours of Men.</P>
<P N="5">5. The&s;e new Directions and Revelations would render the written Word of God in a great Mea&s;ure u&s;ele&s;s to Mankind. What does it avail us, that God has given us his written Word, if it be in&s;ufficient to direct us in the Duties, to which we may be called in our Chri&s;tian Cour&s;e? What Advantage can we have from the Scriptures, if we mu&s;t give Heed to &s;ome new Directions, which are to be daily communicated to us? And it has been ob&s;erved as Matter of Fact, that as it is ea|&s;ier to wait for new Revelations, than to &s;earch the Scriptures; &s;o there are but few of tho&s;e, who depend on immediate Im|pul&s;es, that ever take &s;ufficient Care and Pains to under&s;tand the Divine Law and Te&s;timony. They are generally very ignorant of the true Meaning of the Word of God, notwith|&s;tanding their great Pretences to extraordinary Revelations.</P>
<P>But if your Notions were right, there would have been no Need of the Scriptures at all unle&s;s of one &s;hort Direction, viz. <Q>To take Heed to the immediate Impul&s;es of the Spirit, or the In&s;tructions of the Saviour.</Q> For if your Revelations really come from the Spirit, they are as Divine, and as much to be regarded as any contained in the Bible. <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Barclay &s;peaks con&s;i&s;tently on this Point with his Scheme, when he would not have his divine Revelation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by the Scriptures. <BIBL>See his Apol. Prop. 2.</BIBL></NOTE> What U&s;e then can the Bible be to you, who are immediately taught by the Spirit? If you &s;hould pretend, you would try whether the Divine Spirit taught you right by the Scriptures: This would be prodigiou&s;ly ab&s;urd. For, do you think the Spirit of God can teach you wrong? Would you, ignorant Worms of the Du&s;t, attempt to call the Spirit of God to your Bar and try his Re|velations?
<PB N="38" REF="009120_0029_1030F8F89EF60A68">
Or would you &s;uppo&s;e, that the Spirit of God was wi&s;er when he in&s;pired the Penmen of the holy Scriptures, than when he grants immediate Revelations to you? But this is a bla&s;phemous Ab&s;urdity. How you will judge and try tho&s;e Revelations, you hold to be divine, by the Scriptures, I can't po&s;&s;ibly devi&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus your new Revelations have a direct Tendency to de|&s;troy all U&s;e and Benefit of the written Word of God. When therefore God has given us &s;uch a large written Revelation of his Will in the Scriptures, and commanded us <Q>to &s;earch them;" "to continue &s;tedfa&s;tly in them; <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 15, 16, 17.</NOTE> to take Heed to them;" a&s;&s;uring us "they are a perfect Rule, and pro|fitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for In|&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that the Man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed, unto all good Works:</Q> This &s;aps the very Foundation of all your new Revelations. The Ab&s;urdity and Wickedne&s;s of for&s;aking the Word of God, and following other Spirits and In&s;tructions is &s;trongly painted by the Prophet I&s;aiah <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah viii. 20.</NOTE> <Q>And when they &s;hall &s;ay unto you &s;eek unto them that have familiar Spirits, and unto Wizards that peep and mutter, &s;hould not a People &s;eek unto their God? To the Law and to the Te&s;timony, if they &s;peak not according to this Word, it is becau&s;e there is no Light in them,</Q> i. e. no true Light. For &s;uch Per&s;ons are deluded with imaginary or fal&s;e Light which they receive from their fa|miliar Spirits.</P>
<P N="6">6. Your Notions about immediate Impul&s;es and Revelati|ons expo&s;e you to the Delu&s;ions of Satan. This Evil Spirit can deceive: He can transform him&s;elf into an Angel of Light. There is no Doubt but he can reveal wonderful Things to Per|&s;ons.&mdash;But what Mark have you to di&s;tingui&s;h the Revelations of this bad Spirit from tho&s;e of the good Spirit? You have no certain Rule to judge by, on your Principles. And thus your Notions not admitting of any, evidently expo&s;e you to the De|lu&s;ions of your greate&s;t Adver&s;ary. You tamely deliver your|&s;elves up to be led by him, and wait for his Directions.</P>
<P>Whereas on my Principles, there is a plain and certain Rule, the written Word, which has been confirmed by Miracles.

<P>But Satan has &s;till a more inveterate Grudge and bitter Rancour again&s;t the Scriptures, becau&s;e they are the principal Means which God has u&s;ed to re&s;cue Mankind from his Ty|ranny. This is repre&s;ented in a very &s;triking Manner, in that emblematical Vi&s;ion, which the Apo&s;tle John &s;aw of the Church of Chri&s;t, and of Satan's powerful and malicious A&s;&s;aults again&s;t her. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rev. xii.</NOTE> <Q>The Dragon was wroth with the Woman, and went to make War with the Remnant of her Seed, which keep the Commandments of God, and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Te&s;timony of Je&s;us.</Q> Their keeping the Commandments of God. and faithfully retaining the Te&s;timony, the pure Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, was the great Provocation which filled him with &s;uch implacable Re&s;entment again&s;t them.</P>
<P>It is certain that every Artifice which Wit and Malice can invent has been u&s;ed again&s;t the Scriptures. Sometimes they have been &s;ecreted from the common People, by not being allowed to be tran&s;lated into vulgar Languages. Sometimes Religion has been cumbered with &s;uch a Load of &s;upplementary Traditions, Canons, Rites and Ceremonies, as among the Jews, Papi&s;ts, &amp;c. that the pure written Word of God has been but little regarded. While &s;ome profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians have zea|lou&s;ly contended about their own Additions and Appendixes, they have, as might be ju&s;tly expected, overlooked or for|gotten the Scriptures them&s;elves, at lea&s;t <Q>the more weigh|ty Matters contained in them, Judgment, Mercy, Faith and the Love of God,</Q> and of Men too.&mdash;Since the Re|&s;urrection of Letters when the Scriptures could be no longer &s;ecreted, Things have took another Turn.

them. And though there have been many Commen|tators who have done excellent Service in explaining the Scrip|tures, yet it is al&s;o evident that many have been as bu&s;ily em|ployed in perverting them by wrong Interpretations and forced Comments. <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See the voluminous Annotations of the Je&s;uits, &amp;c.</NOTE> 'Twould perhaps be injurious to &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e Per&s;ons were &s;en&s;ible they were under the Influence of Satan.

<P>Where &s;uch Methods were not likely to &s;ucceed, he has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Men's Minds with the Notion of immediate Reve|lations, Impul&s;es, Vi&s;ions, Prophe&s;yings, &amp;c. When Per&s;ons give Heed to &s;uch extraordinary Things, they &s;oon imagine they are wi&s;er than their ordinary Teachers, and can't be much edified by the plain written Word. They have much more Light about them&s;elves, and others, and can &s;ee their Duty in any Particular Ca&s;e more clearly, by having it immediately revealed to them. When Satan transformed into an Angel of Light, is permitted to deceive Men by fal&s;e Light, no Doubt he &s;uits his Revelations, Impul&s;es and Di&s;coveries, to the di&s;ordered Fancies of his Followers. And when the Palate and Stomach are greatly di&s;ordered, whol&s;ome Food will not be reli&s;hed. If Men's Heads become giddy and their Ima|ginations wild; the plain Truths of the Go&s;pel will not plea&s;e them. The Preaching of Chri&s;t crucified is a low Thing, for which they have no Reli&s;h. And indeed the plain general Truths of the Go&s;pel have no Tendency to e&s;tabli&s;h them in their fond Conceits.

<P>Many of you, I believe, are not remarkably influenced by the powerful Agency of any Spirit. Whatever Truth there may be in what your famous Barclay <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See Barclay's Apol. Prop xi.</NOTE> and others relate about extraordinary Things, that were evident among you at fir&s;t in your Meetings; your Spirit has greatly withdrawn the&s;e pow|erful Agitations from which you are called Quakers, or Trem|blers. I heartily agree with this famous Apologi&s;t that your &s;ilent Meetings are as much for Edification as any among you. For the In&s;tructions and Preaching of &s;uch as pretend to be moved by the Spirit are &s;o trifling and in&s;ipid, that it is &s;trange how any rational Beings can gravely attend upon them. Since the Spirit your Speakers are moved and led by is evidently a fooli&s;h Spirit; I likewi&s;e agree with this Writer that the be&s;t Preparation for your Wor&s;hip in general, is a Man's <Q>ab|&s;taining from his own Thoughts and Imaginations and from all the Self-Workings and Motions of his own Mind, as well in Things materially good as evil.</Q> For if Men would allow them&s;elves to think and rea&s;on they mu&s;t di&s;cover the gro&s;s Ab&s;urdity of &s;uch Wor&s;hip.&mdash;After all the fine Things Bar|clay has &s;aid of your dumb Meetings, they are really but dumb Meetings, a Way of Wor&s;hip more adapted to the Brutes that are not endowed with the Power of Speech, than to Mankind, who&s;e Tongue is a Part of their Glory. When therefore you are about to transform your&s;elves like Dumb Creatures that have no Under&s;tanding, it is no Doubt the mo&s;t &s;uitable Preparati|on for this unrea&s;onable Service to forbare thinking as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The inward Light, which many of you harp &s;o much on, is Nothing but mere natural Con&s;cience which remains in the wor&s;t of Men. Your great Mi&s;take in this Matter lies in ta|king the Dictates of your own Minds and Fancies for the In|&s;pirations of the Holy Gho&s;t. Some of the Dei&s;ts talk as high about inward Light as Enthu&s;ia&s;ts. The Teachers of all your various Sects would do well to read, and &s;eriou&s;ly

con&s;ider the following Pa&s;&s;age in Ezekiel. <Q>Thus &s;aith the Lord God, Wo unto the fooli&s;h Prophets, that follow their own Spirit, and have &s;een Nothing.&mdash; They have &s;een Vani|ty, and lying Divination, &s;aying, the Lord &s;aith; and the Lord hath not &s;ent them, and they have made <HI>others</HI> to hope that they would confirm the Word,</Q> &amp;c. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ezek xiii.</NOTE></P>
<P>In &s;ome In&s;tances your Impul&s;es and Revelations evidently proceed from Infirmities and Di&s;tempers of Body, as Melan|choly, Vapours, Di&s;traction. And yet it is not impo&s;&s;ible, that as Satan has a &s;incere Hatred to Mankind, he may im|prove &s;uch Times as they are lea&s;t able to ob&s;erve and re&s;i&s;t his Temptations, in in&s;til his Sugge&s;tions into their Minds that he may deceive them</P>
<P>But in many Ca&s;es, I make no Doubt, there has been and &s;till is &s;omething remarkable of a powerful and &s;upernatural Agency on the Minds of &s;ome of you: That you really have Things revealed to you in an immediate Way, and have &s;trong Impul&s;es on your Minds far beyond what mere Imagination could po&s;&s;ibly work. And I think it appears evident from what has been &s;aid, that all &s;uch Revelations and Impul&s;es ordinarily come from Satan. For &s;ince the Scriptures, are a &s;ufficient and perfect Rule; all other Revelations are needle&s;s, unwarran|table and contrary to Scripture. God has not confirmed any other Revelation relative to Salvation with Miracles. There|fore they don't bear his Mark and Seal. Now &s;ince they don't come from God, from whom can they come, but from the Evil Spirit.</P>
<P>Ob. It is &s;aid in Joel, <Q>It &s;hall come to pa&s;s afterwards that I will pour out my Spirit upon all Fle&s;h, and your Sons and your Daughters &s;hall Prophe&s;y, your old Men &s;hall dream Dreams and your young Men &s;hall &s;ee Vi&s;ions. And al&s;o upon the Servants and upon the Handmaids in tho&s;e Days will I pour out my Spirit.</Q></P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, it is really a&s;toni&s;hing that any Per&s;on, who has ever read the New Te&s;tament, could alledge this Pa&s;|&s;age to prove, that immediate Revelations and Prophe&s;yings may be expected in our Times. For does not the Apo&s;tle Pe|ter expre&s;sly a&s;&s;ure us, that this Prophecy of Joel was ful|filled
<PB N="44" REF="009120_0032_1030F8FEF0688848">
in his Time, in the <HI>la&s;t Days</HI> of the Jewi&s;h Di&s;pen&s;ation. See his Di&s;cour&s;e upon it at large. Acts ii.</P>
<P>Now, if this Prophecy was fulfilled in the Apo&s;tle's Time, what immediate Reference can it have to us? 'Twas foretold that Sarah &s;hould have a Son. When I&s;aac was born this Prophecy was fulfilled. Can any Woman now a Days infer from this, that &s;he her&s;elf &s;hall have a Son? With equal Pro|priety this Prophecy of Joel, which was fulfilled in Peter's Time, is brought to prove, we may expect Men and Women to be endowed with the Gift of Prophecy in our Day.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t planting of Chri&s;tianity in the World, before Churches were regularly gathered, the Nations were quite ig|norant of the Go&s;pel; and being devoted to their own &s;uper|&s;titious Notions of Religion were extremely prejudiced again&s;t all Attempts that were made to change their religious Ceremonies, e&s;pecially again&s;t the Followers of Je&s;us of Nazareth who was crucified. The fir&s;t Preachers of Chri&s;tianity were placed in the mo&s;t extraordinary Circum&s;tances, having to attack all the Prejudices and Ignorance and Wickedne&s;s of the whole World, and that, without the Countenance of any civil Authority. Nay, the civil Powers exerted them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t, to prevent the Spread of Chri&s;tianity, per&s;ecuting the Preachers of the Go&s;pel to Death.</P>
<P>'Twas therefore agreeable to the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of God to endow the fir&s;t Preachers of the Go&s;pel with extraor|dinary Gifts, &s;uited to the extraordinary Circum&s;tances in which they were placed. Among the&s;e extraordinary Gifts that of Prophecy was one. Their Prophecies, when they were fulfilled, afforded a &s;triking Proof, to tho&s;e who were acquainted with them, of the Truth of their Doctrine. The Prophets who were rai&s;ed up in the fir&s;t Days of the Go&s;pel were likewi&s;e endowed with the Power of working Miracles, they could give &s;upernatural Evidence that they were divinely in&s;pired &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy an hone&s;t Enquirer. With Refe|rence to the&s;e the Apo&s;tle gives that Direction, <Q>De&s;pi&s;e not Prophe&s;yings.</Q> So that they are greatly mi&s;taken, who imagine this Text has any &s;pecial Reference to our Times. 'Tis readily granted there were Prophets in the fir&s;t and extra|ordinary Days of the Go&s;pel, and Chri&s;tians were warned not to de&s;pi&s;e their Prophe&s;yings. And what then? what would
<PB N="45" REF="009120_0032_1030F8FEF0688848">
you i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from this? That there &s;hould be Prophets now, when the Scriptures are compleated, and Churches regularly &s;ettled and &s;upplied with a learned, orthodox and godly Mi|ni&s;try?

<P>But would you in &s;ober Blood attempt to prove from Scrip|ture that there are Prophets, when it is certain and plain Matter of Fact, that there are none? Your Rea&s;oning, if it proved any Thing, would prove that the Scriptures are not true, &s;ince it is inconte&s;tably evident, that they are not ful|filled in your Sen&s;e of them. For where are your Prophets? What Events have they foretold? Have their Predictions been fulfilled?</P>
<P>I have heard of many and read &s;undry Prophe&s;ies in late Years. Some of you, I have been informed, prophe&s;ied, that the French would de&s;troy New-England, becau&s;e its Inhabi|tants would not turn to you. Others of you 'tis &s;aid, pro|phe&s;ied that &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons would not die. Others have prophe&s;ied, that in a &s;hort Time the Lord would con|vert all our Churches to your Notions. But the&s;e Prophe&s;ies have been mo&s;t plainly contradicted by the Event and proved to be fal&s;e.</P>
<P>A remarkable Di&s;covery of the Fal&s;ehood of your Prophe|&s;ies happened &s;ome Time &s;ince in your predicting that Mr. Elihu Dagget was to be a Mini&s;ter among you. This was revealed to &s;undry. They examined their Revelations by &s;e|parati&s;h Rules and found them to be right. They were &s;o confident of the Truth of their Revelations, &s;o certain their Predictions would be fulfilled, that they appointed a Day to ordain him. Va&s;t Crouds of People a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee his Or|dination. But Mr. Dagget him&s;elf refu&s;ed to be ordained, &s;aying it was not revealed to him, that he mu&s;t be their Mi|ni&s;ter. They exhorted him, and prayed over him, 'till they were tired; but he could get no Light; &s;o that they were obliged to return home &s;hamefully di&s;appointed, proving them&s;elves to be fal&s;e Prophets. For if their Prophecy had been from God, he would have given Mr. Dagge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Di&s;po&s;i|tion

to have complied; &s;ince the Preparation of the Heart in Man, and the An&s;wer of the Tongue is from the Lord. He never &s;uffered any of his Words to fall to the Ground. God was never deceived nor fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>As to what is reported about your foretelling that &s;ome par|ticular Per&s;ons would be converted, which Predictions are pretended to be fulfilled, this may be contrived and publi&s;hed to give &s;ome Reputation to your Scheme among &s;ome undi&s;|cerning Per&s;ons; but is in reality a Piece of Delu&s;ion. For you cannot know that &s;uch particular Per&s;ons are converted. It is great Pre&s;umption for you to pretend to know certainly who are truly converted, when God has declared in the &s;trong|e&s;t Terms, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Jer. xvii. 8, 9.</NOTE> that <Q>the Heart is deceitful above all Things and de&s;perately wicked, who can know it? I the Lord &s;earch the Heart.</Q> So that this is to prove a Prediction to be certainly fulfilled by an Event, which you cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;&s;i|bly know, whether it is &s;o or not.</P>
<P>If you &s;hould pretend God has revealed it to you they are converted, then work Miracles to prove the Revelation comes from God, and not from the Devil. What &s;ignifies your Witne&s;&s;ing for one another, and Fellow&s;hip with another's Spirits? How often have you witne&s;&s;ed for &s;ome, whom you mu&s;t own have turned Apo&s;tates, and however loth you may be mu&s;t witne&s;s again&s;t them. When you bear certain Witne&s;s, that a Man is converted, and afterwards certain Witne&s;s that he is not, this &s;hews your Witne&s;s is not worth a Straw. How often have you been deceived in your Declarations about Converts?</P>
<P>For any Thing that I &s;ee, the Devil might reval it to you, that &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons would be converted; and then, transforming him&s;elf into an Angel of Light might deceive them, with a fal&s;e Conver&s;ion to carry on his De&s;igns the more plau&s;ibly.</P>

Did not Satan enforce his Temptations on our Savi|our by Texts of Scripture? and is it not evident from the Narrative of John Lewis, that he was impo&s;ed on and delud|ed by Satan &s;ugge&s;ting and impre&s;&s;ing Texts of Scripture on his Mind?</P>
<P N="2">2. Others look upon the Power or Force, with which a Scripture comes to them and is impre&s;&s;ed on their Minds, as an unque&s;tionable Evidence, that the Impre&s;&s;ion is from God. Is not this the chief Evidence which many of you tru&s;t to, when you would prove that your Impre&s;&s;ions and Interpretati|ons of Scripture are from above? Have not &s;undry of you &s;eparated from us, becau&s;e it was &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on your Minds that you mu&s;t leave us? The&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions are &s;ome|times &s;o powerful as greatly to affect your Bodies. Hence your ridiculous Motions, Rockings, Twi&s;tings, Jumpings &amp;c. in your pretended religious Meetings and Exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>There is no Doubt to be made but the Spirit of God could impre&s;s divine Truths with &s;uch Force on our Minds, as would not only greatly affect, but even di&s;&s;olve our weak Frame. But as he knows our Make, there is Rea&s;on to think that he does not ordinarily exert much Force, &s;o as violently to agitate the Body in be&s;towing his converting and &s;anctifying Influen|ces. The Vi&s;ions of I&s;aiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Paul and John, were very extraordinary indeed, and not to be commonly ex|pected. Such Extraordinaries are not nece&s;&s;ary for Salvation. The Divine Spirit enlightens the Mind in a gentle Manner which but &s;eldom agitates the Body. Divine Light poured into the Mind di&s;covers the Way, the Man's Judgment is convinced, his Objections vani&s;h, he readily complies. So that there is no Need of any forcible Pre&s;&s;ure on his Body to com|pel him. Whereas when Satan leads Per&s;ons to any Thing, &s;ince he has no Divine Light to di&s;cover Truth to them, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e he u&s;es, if permitted, a Sort of a Force,
<PB N="48" REF="009120_0034_1030F9096A2922F8">
&s;omething like the Charming or Enchanting of Serpents, when they bring Birds into their very Mouths.</P>
<P>This Matter, I think, is fully illu&s;trated and proved by the following Scriptures. <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xix. 11.13.</NOTE> <Q>And behold the Lord pa&s;&s;ed by, and a great and &s;trong Wind rent the Mountains, and brake in Pieces the Rocks before the Lord; <HI>but</HI> the Lord <HI>was</HI> not in the Wind: and after the Wind an Earthquake; <HI>but</HI> the Lord <HI>was</HI> not in the Earthquake: and after the Earthquake a Fire; <HI>but</HI> the Lord <HI>was</HI> not in the Fire: and after the Fire a &s;till &s;mall Voice. And it was <HI>&s;o</HI> when Elijah heard <HI>it</HI> that he wrapped his Face in his Mantle and &s;tood in the Entring in of the Cave.</Q> The Lord was not in tho&s;e powerful &s;hocking Convul&s;ions. But he was with the &s;till &s;mall Voice.</P>
<P>When the Spirit was plea&s;ed to grant the Church immedi|ate Revelations and Prophecies, in the fir&s;t Days of the Go&s;pel, the Apo&s;tle gives the following Directions. <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xvi. 30.32.</NOTE> <Q>If <HI>any Thing</HI> be revealed to another that &s;itteth by, let the Fir&s;t hold his Peace. For ye may all Prophecy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. And the Spirits of the Prophets are &s;ubject to the Prophets.</Q> Which Clau&s;e Dr. Doddridge thus paraphra&s;es; <Q>There is no Impo&s;&s;ibility of doing this; <HI>for</HI> the Spirit of God that in&s;pires you, is not a wild irre&s;i&s;tible Impul&s;e, like that by which the Pythian Prie&s;te&s;s, and others who profe&s;s In&s;piration and Prophecy among the Gentiles, pretend to be agitated; but <HI>the-Spirits</HI> or In&s;pirations of the Chri&s;tian Prophets produce tho&s;e calm Emotions which <HI>are &s;ubject to the Prophets.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Satan is a very powerful Being, having been one of the Chief of the Angels, that "excell in Strength." We read <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">11 The&s;&s;. ii. 9, 10.</NOTE> of <Q>one who&s;e coming is after the Working of Satan, with all Power;" and that "&s;ome would be given up to <HI>&s;trong</HI> Delu&s;ions.</Q> So that the Power, Strength or Force, with which any particular Text of Scripture is &s;ugge&s;&s;ed to a Man, and borne in upon his Mind, cannot be ju&s;tly looked upon as a certain di&s;tingui&s;hing Evidence, that the Impre&s;&s;ion is from God.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence, we learn, what to think of that which others mention as a Mark that their Impre&s;&s;ions come from God, viz.
<PB N="49" REF="009120_0034_1030F9096A2922F8">
<Q>that they have &s;trong Oppo&s;ition again&s;t them, that they &s;trive and &s;truggle to re&s;i&s;t, but at length are compelled by the Force and Weight which they feel, to yield.</Q> 'Tis to be ob&s;erved, that all this Oppo&s;ition, which the&s;e Per&s;ons &s;peak of, is after they have had their Impre&s;&s;ions, after they &s;ee and know that they are clearly taught their Duty in &s;uch In&s;tances. But the Spirit of God teaches Men, by renewing their Minds, and enlightning their Under&s;tandings in the Truth. The&s;e Operations of the Spirit remove Men's Oppo&s;ition to the Truth. So that it is &s;trange that Per&s;ons &s;hould feel this Oppo&s;ition to the Teachings of the true Spirit, and feel it exceeding &s;trong too; yea, and to be overcome at la&s;t rather by &s;ome unac|countable Force upon the Body, than Light and Rea&s;on di&s;|covered to the Mind.</P>
<P>There is a Di&s;po&s;ition in Men, by Nature to re&s;i&s;t the Spirit, <HI>That is,</HI> their &s;inful Lu&s;ts and Inclinations are contrary to God and Holine&s;s. The Oppo&s;ition of Sinners to the Spirit ari&s;es from their Lu&s;ts and Ignorance. But the Oppo&s;ition which the&s;e Per&s;ons mention, &s;o far as I can judge from their De|&s;cription of it, is the Oppo&s;ition, their better Rea&s;on and Con|&s;cience make again&s;t their Impre&s;&s;ions. I wi&s;h this Matter may be as &s;eriou&s;ly and candidly con&s;idered, as its Importance re|quires.&mdash;The&s;e are two very different Sorts of Oppo&s;ition, and I think might be clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed, if thoroughly ex|amined.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ition to the Admonitions of the Spirit by the written. Word &s;et home on the Heart, becau&s;e they are contrary to Men's &s;inful Lu&s;ts, is very common. It is often reproved in the Scriptures, and is beyond all Controver&s;y a very &s;inful Oppo&s;ition. But there may al&s;o be, yea often are &s;trange and ab&s;urd Impre&s;&s;ions on Men's Minds, which their Con&s;cience and Rea&s;on can't but oppo&s;e. They don't really &s;ee the Thing impre&s;&s;ed on their Minds to be right, and they have not &s;uffi|cient Evidence that the Impre&s;&s;ion comes from God. For this would ordinarily remove their Oppo&s;ition, as in Paul's Ca&s;e. If therefore the Oppo&s;ition ari&s;eth from Men's Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience, I don't &s;ee, how they can make this any Mark at all of the Impre&s;&s;ions coming from God. I &s;hould rather think, it was an Evidence of its coming from Satan; &s;ince the Spirit of God con&s;tantly applies, in his teaching Men
<PB N="50" REF="009120_0035_1030F90B089B2FA0">
by Scripture, to Men's Con&s;ciences, and &s;hews them &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons to prove that the Things, he urges them to, are right; and thus leaves them without Excu&s;e. Whereas Sa|tan hurries Men along blindfold.</P>
<P>Virgil, the celebrated Heathen Poet, de&s;cribes the Sibyl, the Prie&s;te&s;s of the Idol-Apollo, as &s;truggling violently under the powerful Impre&s;&s;ions of the Evil Spirit. They who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with Evil Spirits in the Days of Chri&s;t, &s;truggled a|gain&s;t their violent Agitations, as we are informed by the Evangeli&s;ts. John Lewis &s;ay, <Q>I did &s;everal Times between the fir&s;t Impul&s;e and the Execution of the horrid Deed &s;trive to re&s;i&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>But the Apo&s;tles, when they were called by Chri&s;t, imme|diately without manife&s;ting any Oppo&s;ition obeyed his Divine Call. Who was a more violent Oppo&s;er of Je&s;us of Nazareth, and his Followers, than the Apo&s;tle Paul in his Unbelief? Yet as &s;oon as he was commanded by Chri&s;t, he immediately obey|ed. We don't read, that he <HI>&s;trove</HI> and <HI>&s;truggled</HI> again&s;t the Divine Command. His Oppo&s;ition though very violent before, was then in&s;tantly removed. He immediately obeyed the heavenly Vi&s;ion. Is it not a&s;toni&s;hing that Oppo&s;ition to Im|pre&s;&s;ions &s;hould be made a certain Evidence of their coming from God!</P>
<P N="4">4. Others imagine that their &s;uffering Reproach for fol|lowing their Impre&s;&s;ions, is a good Proof of their proceeding from the divine Spirit; &s;ince the World has a Di&s;reli&s;h for the Things of the Spirit of God. Hence, &s;ome make a great Outcry about Pe&s;ecution, as if they were violently abu&s;ed and per&s;ecuted, becau&s;e they don't enjoy &s;uch great Immunities and Privileges, as the regular e&s;tabli&s;hed Churches in the Co|lony. They magnify the&s;e Things, and the Reproaches and Ridicule, they meet with for their Follies, are very grievous Oppre&s;&s;ions and &s;ore Per&s;ecutions. Whereas there is no Part of the World that enjoys Liberty more fully than the Briti&s;h Colonies. We may &s;ay with the greate&s;t Propriety in the Words of Peter, <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">1 Peter iii. 13.</NOTE> <Q>Who is he that will harm you if ye be Followers of that which is good.</Q> According to him it is not true, that the World is always di&s;po&s;ed openly to per&s;ecute
<PB N="51" REF="009120_0035_1030F90B089B2FA0">
Men becau&s;e they are good. In Times of Per&s;ecution, good Men are repre&s;ented as Evil, before they are per&s;ecuted.</P>
<P>The Oppo&s;ition and Enmity, which natural Men have to the Go&s;pel in Chri&s;tian Countries, and in Lands of Liberty, con|&s;i&s;ts rather in the Ignorance of their Minds, and Contrariety of their Hearts, Wills and Lu&s;ts to God and Chri&s;t, than in open Per&s;ecution of true Saints. There are many unconverted Per&s;ons who on one Account and another have a great Regard for Men, who are eminently religious. The Children of Heth, who were Heathens e&s;teemed and honoured Abraham. <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Gen. xx. 3.</NOTE> Saul who was a wicked King honoured the holy Prophet Samuel.</P>
<P>But it is certain, that while Rea&s;on remains in the World, Follies and Incon&s;i&s;tencies in Conduct will expo&s;e Men to Ri|dicule. There is no Po&s;&s;ibility of helping this. But what &s;pe|cial Virtue there is in being thus ridiculous, I am yet to learn. <Q>What Glory, <HI>&s;ays Peter,</HI> is it if when ye be buffeted for your Faults, ye take it patiently?</Q> Mo&s;t certainly then there is much le&s;s Glory, when you bear your de&s;erved Reproaches with great Impatience; and retaliate them fourfold with Bit|terne&s;s and Railing, which your Neighbours can te&s;tify is your con&s;tant Practice.</P>
<P N="5">5. Others look on the great Zeal with which they are filled, in Con&s;equence of their Impre&s;&s;ions, as a certain Proof of their coming from God. It is readily granted, that Men &s;hould be very zealous about Religion, and that good Men, who are quickened by the Spirit, are filled with much holy Zeal. This Zeal proceeds from the &s;aving Knowledge of God through Chri&s;t, and di&s;po&s;es the Man who has it to have a tender Concern for the divine Glory, and hearty Charity or Love for Mankind, and it is always regulated by the Rules con|tained in the written Word of God. Right Zeal, like the Wi&s;|dom that is from above, &s;hould be fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be intreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality and without Hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be remembered, that the &s;en&s;ible Motions of the Blood and animal Spirits, which ordinarily accompany Zeal, depend in a great Mea&s;ure on the Con&s;titution of the Body; and will be very different in different Per&s;ons, who are equal|ly religious according to their re&s;pective Con&s;titutions. Hence,
<PB N="52" REF="009120_0036_1030F90C97E9AC70">
it is difficult to judge of the Affections of others, from the vi&s;ible Di&s;coveries, they make of their Zeal. The Apo&s;tle Peter was a Man of a natural warm Make: The Apo&s;tle John was of a meek and gentle Spirit. He was of a calm and pa|cifick Temper; yet it does not appear that the zealous and forward Peter was a more eminent Saint, or really more en|gaged in Religion, than the meek and humble John. Each of them had his peculiar Gift in which he excelled. Peter had been much to blame if he had di&s;pi&s;ed John.</P>
<P>The Scriptures and the Rea&s;on of Things inform us, there is a fal&s;e Zeal as well as a true. Per&s;ons may be very zealous about their Religion, who are quite Strangers to the Influences of the holy Spirit. Were not Baal's Prophets extremely zea|lous in Elijah's Time about their <HI>own Religion?</HI> about the Credit of their Wor&s;hip and favourite Idol? And was not Jezebel equally engaged? Jehu does not appear to have been &s;incerely religious; yet he was ready to call upon others to come and &s;ee his Zeal for the Lord. Were not the Scribes and Phari&s;ees ignorant of Chri&s;t the Lord of Glory? yet who were more zealous than they? How much engaged were they to make Pro&s;elytes, and encrea&s;e their Number? They would compa&s;s Sea and Land to gain one new Di&s;ciple. Yea, in the Height of their ignorant Zeal, they crucified Chri&s;t him&s;elf. As true Zeal is always an Attendant of true Religion; &s;o fal&s;e Zeal con&s;tantly accompanies Delu&s;ion, otherwi&s;e the Counter|feit would be very imperfect. And indeed there is no Branch of the Chri&s;tian Character that is more ea&s;ily, and commonly Counterfeited than Zeal, as appears from the foregoing In|&s;tances.</P>
<P>Pride and Self-Will in Men, if they are oppo&s;ed, will often make them zealous. Oppo&s;ition &s;tirs Men's Angry Pa&s;&s;ions, and frequently enflames them with burning Zeal again&s;t their Adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>It is certain that Per&s;ons may do a great Deal at heating their own Fancies, and kindling the Fire of Enthu&s;ia&s;m by their own Indu&s;try and Labour. Tho&s;e who have not been acquainted with &s;uch Things, would be &s;urprized to &s;ee what labouring and toiling will do at rai&s;ing forced Tran&s;ports. And may not Satan be ready to blow this Wild-Fire.

<P>When Per&s;ons have embibed the Notion, which it is to be feared the greater Part of you have, that bodily Exerci&s;e is a principal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">art of eminent Holine&s;s; when the Heads of your Parties cen&s;ure and condemn all rea&s;onable Religion and &s;o|lid Piety as &s;tupid, lifele&s;s and dead Services; and recommend extravagant Rants by their Examples and Exhortations, as the highe&s;t Devotion, practically teaching that in Order to &s;erve God acceptably, you mu&s;t fir&s;t get tran&s;ported beyond all Appearance of Rea&s;on; it is not at all wonderful, if many who have no real Sen&s;e of Divine Things on their Minds &s;hould try to force and work them&s;elves up to &s;uch wild Frenzies. But all &s;ober, under&s;tanding Chri&s;tians &s;ee there is &s;omething extremely odious in this mechanical or forced Zeal. Such Zeal is doubtle&s;s one of the greate&s;t Indignities that can be offered to a jealous God.</P>
<P>But not to enlarge on this, &s;ince extraordinary Heat and Zeal may proceed from a warm Imagination worked up by Men's own Labour and Indu&s;try; &s;ince it may be rai&s;ed by the Agency of Satan; it cannot be allowed to be any certain Mark that the Impre&s;&s;ions, which it accompanies, come from God. When Men's Zeal &s;tirs them up to Extravagancies, it may be looked on as an Evidence, they are not then moved by divine Influences. For the Spirit has expre&s;sly revealed that <Q>God is not the Author of Confu&s;ion but of Peace, as in all Churches of the Saints.</Q> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiv. 33.</NOTE> So that according to this Text i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any pretended religious A&s;&s;emblies, allow and approve of Di&s;orders and Confu&s;ions they are not to be accounted Churches of Saints. They are not to be owned as Churches of Chri&s;t at all, &s;o far forth as they countenance Di&s;orders.</P>
<P N="6">6. Others pretend, that their Impre&s;&s;ions make them ex|ceeding humble. I readily grant that true Humility is a good Evidence. For it is not probable, that Satan, the proud Spirit, would try to make Men truly humble. But it is one Thing for Men to be really humble, and another to &s;ay and profe&s;s they are &s;o</P>
<P>There is &s;omething &s;o very abominable and &s;hockingly mon|&s;trous
<PB N="54" REF="009120_0037_1030F90E27360278">
in Pride, it renders a Per&s;on &s;o like the Devil, that few or none will ever profe&s;s they are proud. According to my Ob&s;ervations, Men generally make &s;ome Preten&s;ions to Hu|mility; &s;o that your profe&s;&s;ing that your Impre&s;&s;ions make you very humble, is no &s;ufficient Evidence that you are &s;o. When a Man profe&s;&s;es to be very humble, this is the &s;ame Thing as to profe&s;s in other Words, that he is a very excellent Chri&s;tian. And may not a Man who has much &s;piritual Pride, and only a Shew of Humanity profe&s;s this?</P>
<P>If you were really humble, how came you to be &s;o wi&s;e in your own Conceits, and to have &s;uch a high Opinion of your own Gifts, Experiences and Graces? And &s;o much Contempt for all but your&s;elves? Whence is it, that you don't pay any Regard to the Rea&s;ons and Judgment of any Man or Number of Men, let them be never &s;o wi&s;e, learned and godly; but tram|ple on all Churches, and their Determinations, but your own, with the greate&s;t Di&s;dain? Did you not make this one grand Plea for your Separations from us, that our Churches were not pure enough for &s;uch holy Per&s;ons as you? Were you not afraid &s;uch eminent Saints as you would be poluted by having Communion with &s;uch Sinners, as you think we are? Is it not then a downright barefaced In&s;ult on common Sen&s;e, for you to pretend to Humility, when your whole Conduct loudly declares that you are lifted up beyond Mea&s;ure with Pride? But pro|bably it was powerfully impre&s;&s;ed on your Minds, you were more excellent than your Neighbours. If you had &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion on your Minds, your own Con&s;cience and Rea&s;on doutle&s;s oppo&s;ed it at fir&s;t, becau&s;e there were &s;undry Things that rendered it very improbable. But there was &s;omething &s;o agreeable in the Impre&s;&s;ion, you at length gave Way to it, and now act upon it.</P>
<P>Now can you think, can any Body believe, that an Impre&s;|&s;ion, that has puffed you up with Pride, and in&s;pired you with Di&s;dain towards Thou&s;ands that are really &s;uperior to you, could come from God?</P>
<P>What tho' you de&s;pi&s;e fine Cloaths, and new Fa&s;hions, and exclaim again&s;t them? You may take as much Pride in rail|ing again&s;t them, as others do in following them. Rea&s;on and common Sen&s;e plainly direct Per&s;ons to appear in that Dre&s;s, in which they are likely to be lea&s;t &s;tared at, and talked
<PB N="55" REF="009120_0037_1030F90E27360278">
about; &s;ince there are but few, who have Merit enough to &s;upport an extraordinary Character. When Per&s;ons dre&s;s above or below what is accounted &s;uitable for their E&s;tates and Sta|tions, in the Place and Age where they live, they are Offenders again&s;t this Rule, and are often puni&s;hed by Ridicule.</P>
<P>Mode&s;t Apparel is recommended by the Scriptures, which are the Standard of good Sen&s;e, as well as Religion. Unaf|fected Neatne&s;s is celebrated as the Perfection of Dre&s;s by the be&s;t Judges. Women who are really beautiful need not, and tho&s;e who are truly virtuous will not, greatly &s;tudy to outdo others in Finery and Fa&s;hions; unle&s;s they have a &s;trong Tinc|ture of Vanity, or a wrong Ta&s;te. They would not be the le&s;s amiable, tho' they &s;hould not conform to the Fa&s;hions, that are contrary to common Sen&s;e, private Beauty and Fami|ly Conveniency. But if &s;uch, as have but little Virtue, and Beauty, &s;hould try to recommend them&s;elves by extravagant Finery, dre&s;&s;ing even beyond the Fa&s;hion, however inconve|nient and ridiculous it may be, they would commonly find them&s;elves &s;adly di&s;appointed; &s;ince hereby, they would make a glaring Di&s;covery of their exce&s;&s;ive Vanity, Want of Sen&s;e and true Ta&s;te. Extravagance in Dre&s;s is &s;till more ab&s;urd in Men. What a &s;orry Character do Pops &s;u&s;tain? 'Tis a Pity they are not always mortified by Neglect or Ridicule, which they &s;o ju&s;tly merit with great Pains and Expence.</P>
<P>But &s;ince Mankind are proud of many Things be&s;ides Cloaths, it will not follow, that all, who rail again&s;t Finery and new Fa&s;hions are truly humble. Some may do this to make a Righteou&s;ne&s;s of their Zeal again&s;t Foppery. Some may from merefullenne&s;s put on Rags, when they &s;ee others glare in Robes. But in true Humility the Mind is humbled, bro't to a meek and lowly temper. Such Per&s;ons are poor in Spi|rit, diffident of their own Wi&s;dom, and ready to e&s;teem others better than them&s;elves, but not forward to exerci&s;e them&s;elves in great Matters, or Things too high for them. <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxxxi.</NOTE></P>
<P>As Pride often appears in exce&s;&s;ive Finery, 'tis not impro|bable that &s;ome Hypocrites may attempt to counterfeit the amiable Grace of Humility by a mean and &s;ordid Dre&s;s. It is certain &s;ome Super&s;titious Devotees among Heathens and

Leland, with &s;ome of his Remarks upon it. <NOTE N="&s;" PLACE="foot">See his View of Dei&s;tical Writers. 1 Vol. Letter xxi.</NOTE></P>
<Q><P>He was the elde&s;t Son of an ancient, rich, and honorable Family, and therefore born to an opulent Fortune: though his Father, when he &s;aw his turn of Mind, very prudently left him but a Part of it, and that in the Hands of his younger Brother. But though he &s;till had an ample Pro|vi&s;ion made for him, he voluntarily deprived him&s;elf of all the Conveniences and even the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life. He cho&s;e one ob&s;cure Hole or Cottage after another to live in, and often mixed with Beggars, whom he re&s;embled &s;o much in his Cu&s;toms, &s;ordid and tattered Garb, and whole Manner of his Life, that he was &s;ometimes taken for one, and was never better plea&s;ed, than when this expo&s;ed him in the Streets and Ways to Deri&s;ion and Contempt. Poverty was what he &s;o much affected, that though he applied to his Brother for what his Father had left him, yet that he might not have the Appearance of being rich, he cho&s;e not to take it as what was legally due to him, but to &s;upplicate for it in the humble&s;t Terms, as for an Alms freely be&s;towed upon a mi&s;erable Object that had nothing of his own. And yet in his la&s;t Will, he di&s;po&s;ed of it as his own to various U&s;es as he thought fit, e&s;pecially for the Benefit of tho&s;e who had been Sufferers for the Jan&s;eni&s;ts Cau&s;e. For &s;e|veral of the la&s;t Years of his Life he &s;eemed to make it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to contrive Ways to weaken, or harra&s;s, and tor|ture his Body, and thereby ha&s;ten his own Death. Whil&s;t he gave away his Income to the poor, he him&s;elf vo|luntarily endured all the Evils and Hard&s;hips which attended the Extremity of Want and Poverty. Mean and wretched was his Garb, black Bread, Water and Herbs, but without Oil, Salt, or Vinegar, or any Thing to give them Savour, was his only Su&s;tenance, and that but once a Day. He lay upon the Ground, and was worn away with continual Watch|ings. After his Death, were found his Hair Shirt, an Iron Cro&s;s, a Girdle, Stomacher and Bracelets of the &s;ame Me|tal,
<PB N="57" REF="009120_0038_1030F9116A5B3B30">
all be&s;tuck with &s;harp Points. The&s;e were the In&s;tru|ments of Penitence, with which he was wont to cha&s;ti&s;e him|&s;elf, the plain Marks of which he bore in his Body. By &s;uch a Cour&s;e he brought him&s;elf not only into great Weak|ne&s;s of Body, but into Di&s;orders of Mind: And this, which was the natural Effect of his Manner of Living, he attribu|ted to the Influence of the Devil, whom God had in ju&s;t Judgment permitted to puni&s;h him for his Sins. And in enquiring into the Cau&s;es of divine Di&s;plea&s;ure, he fixed up|on this, that he had &s;till too great a Love for <HI>human Learn|ing</HI> and Knowledge, and therefore from thenceforth did all he could to dive&s;t him&s;elf of it, and would have &s;old his well furni&s;hed Library, if he had not been prevented by &s;ome of his Friends, who&s;e Intere&s;t it was to pre&s;erve it. For two Years together he refu&s;ed to come to the holy Supper, under Pretence that it was not lawful for him to come, God having required him to ab&s;tain from it: And it was with great Difficulty that he was brought to it at la&s;t, by the Threatnings and even Reproaches of his Confe&s;&s;or. Final|ly, that no Kind of Mi&s;ery might be wanting to him, he cho&s;e for his Companion to dwell with him in his Cottage, a Man that was looked upon to be crazy, and who treated him in the mo&s;t injurious Manner. He did all he could to hide him&s;elf from his Friends in one &s;orry Cottage after another, and about a Month before his Death fixed him&s;elf in a little Lodge in the Corner of a Garden, expo&s;ed to the Sun and Wind. When by &s;uch Severities he had brought him&s;elf into an univer&s;al bad habit of Body, and it was vi&s;ible to his Friends, that if he continued in that Cour&s;e he would not long &s;upport under it; a Phy&s;ician was called in, who only de&s;ired him to remove to a more commodious Habita|tion, to allow him&s;elf more Sleep, and a better Diet, and e&s;|pecially to take nouri&s;hing Broths for re&s;toring his enfebled Con&s;titution. But all the Per&s;wa&s;ions of his Phy&s;ician, Confe&s;&s;or, and of his Friends, and the Tears of an only Bro|ther, could not prevail with him to follow an Advice &s;o rea|&s;onable and practicable; though he was a&s;&s;ured, that if he u&s;e the Method there was great Hope of his Recovery, and that his Life could not be pre&s;erved without it. And when at la&s;t to &s;atisfy their importunity, he &s;eemed &s;o far to com|ply,
<PB N="58" REF="009120_0039_1030F913045CDDF8">
as to be willing to take &s;ome Broth, it was only an Ap|pearance of complying, for he took Care to give &s;uch Orders, to the Per&s;on who was to prepare it for him, that it really yield|ed little or no Nouri&s;hment. Thus it was manife&s;t, that he had determined to ha&s;ten, as much as in him lay, his own Death. And accordingly he told his Confe&s;&s;or, that this Life had nothing in it to make it worth a Chri&s;tian's Care to pre|&s;erve it.</P>
<P>However &s;uch Things procured him &s;o extraordinary a Reputation that he has pa&s;&s;ed for one of the greate&s;t Saints that ever appeared in the Chri&s;tian Church. No &s;ooner was he dead, but an innumerable Multitude of People ran to his Corp&s;e, &s;ome of whom ki&s;&s;ed his Feet, others cut off Part of his Hair as a Remedy again&s;t all Manner of Evils,; others bro't Books or Bits of Cloth to touch his Body, as believing it filled with a divine Virtue. Thus were they prepared to believe and expect the mo&s;t wonderful Things&mdash;But it can|not in Con&s;i&s;tency with Rea&s;on be &s;uppo&s;ed, that God &s;hould extraordinarily interpo&s;e by his own divine Power, to do Honor to the Bones and A&s;hes of a Man weak and &s;uper|&s;titious to a Degree of Folly, and who was knowingly and willingly acce&s;&s;ory to his own Death.</P>
<P>How different is this from the beautiful and noble Idea of Piety and Virtue which the Go&s;pel furni&s;heth us with, and from the perfect Pattern of moral Excellency which is &s;et us by our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf in his own holy Life and Practices! That the great Apo&s;tle St. Paul was far from en|couraging &s;uch Au&s;terites as tended to hurt and de&s;troy the bodily Health, &s;ufficiently appeareth from the Advice he gave to <HI>Timothy, Drink no longer Water, but u&s;e a little Wine, for thy Stomach's Sake and thine often Infirmities.</HI> 1 Tim. v. 23.

<P>If a Sinner under &s;light Convictions &s;hould have a Di&s;covery made to him by the fal&s;e Spirit, from &s;ome Text of Scripture, that God loved him with a &s;pecial Love, and would deliver him from Hell and receive him into Heaven, he would un|doubtedly love God under that View. The Principles of na|tural Gratitude, which are implanted in the human Heart, would immediately produce &s;uch a Love as this. Indeed it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> great Difficulty to per&s;wade unconverted Sinners, or even tho&s;e that have but &s;light and partial Convictions, to believe that God has a peculiar Fondne&s;s for them. But let &s;uch Per|&s;ons be brought effectually to &s;ee their exceeding great Sinful|ne&s;s, and the many black Aggravations with which their Sins have been attended, and they'll lo&s;e all this Faith and Love. Nothing can then &s;upport them but a real Di&s;covery of the glorious Mediator Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Hence, I don't wonder that &s;ome of you di&s;card Convicti|ons out of your Religion. <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><Q>It mu&s;t be intimated to Sinners that whatever before this Time has been believed to be a Preparation for coming to God is rather an Ob&s;ticle.</Q> See <HI>Rimius</HI>'s Narrative, 51, 52.

Neither do they enable a Man to

convert him&s;elf. The Law has Power to &s;tay, but it cannot bring to Life again. In Convictions a Man does not prepare him&s;elf for the Grace of God; but the Spirit of God prepares his own Way, treating the Sinner like a rational Creature, that &s;o he may be willing to for&s;ake his Sins, renounce his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and receive and re&s;t upon Chri&s;t alone for Sal|vation. 'Tis the Scripture Doctrine, that <HI>the Spirit convinces of Sin, and of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; that by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin; that Sinners are alive in their own Conceits, 'till the Command|ment is &s;et home on their Con&s;ciences.</HI> <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">John xvi. 8. &amp;c. Rom. iii. 20. and vii. 9. And &s;ee Dr. Owen on Ju&s;ti|fication, p. 1.&mdash;40. And Saxter's Saints Everla&s;ting Re&s;t, p. 13.</NOTE> Tho' Per&s;ons may make a Righteou&s;ne&s;s of &s;light Convictions, yet thorough Conviction is one great Thing which kills their proud Hopes. There is no Probability that ever any Sinner will renounce all Depen|dence on his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, till he is thoroughly con|vinced by the Law of its utter In&s;ufficiency. To di&s;card Convictions and preaching up the Law in its Purity, Strictne&s;s and Tenor is an infallible Recipe to feed human Pride&mdash;But then Men will be more ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to believe God loves them, and that Chri&s;t died for them in particular. Proud Ha|man thought in his Heart, to whom would the King delight to do Honor more than to my&s;elf? And indeed if the Antino|mian Notion of Faith, viz. a Believing that Chri&s;t died for me in particular were true, legal Convictions would be the great|e&s;t Ob&s;tacle to it. So that in this the Moravians are by far more con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves than other Antinomians. The le&s;s Sen&s;e a Sinner has of his own Unworthine&s;s, and the more he values his own Excellency; the more ea&s;ily he can believe, that God has a &s;ingular Regard for him, and that Chri&s;t mu&s;t have a peculiar E&s;teem for him, and if he died for any Body, be&s;ure for him.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us now attend a little to the Method in which the Spirit of God teaches Men in his Word.&mdash;As there are only general Truths in the Scripture, the Spirit of God enlightens Men's Minds only in general Truths. The Scriptures give us an Account of God, his glorious Perfections and Excellen|cies. They repre&s;ent his Law to be mo&s;t excellent and im|portant, to be holy, ju&s;t and good. They de&s;cribe Sin again&s;t God to be mo&s;t vile and abominable, and con&s;equently
<PB N="63" REF="009120_0041_1030F5B2784F63D8">
that Sinners are vile and wretched Creatures. They a&s;&s;ert there is no Door of Hope for Sinners but through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who being the only begotten Son of God, the Brightne&s;s of his Glory and the expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on, by him&s;elf purged our Sins, or made Attonement for them on the Cro&s;s; and that who&s;oever believes in this glorious Redeemer &s;hall not peri&s;h but have everla&s;ting Life. The&s;e are general De&s;crip|tions of Per&s;ons and Things con&s;idered in them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now when the Spirit of God in&s;tructs Sinners in the Scriptures, he gives them a real view or Sen&s;e of the&s;e Things, according to that <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> Scheme which is in the Scriptures. He does not repre&s;ent one Scripture contrary to another. He brings them to have the &s;ame Notions of the&s;e important Things, as he has delivered in his Word. They &s;ee by his In|fluences that the De&s;criptions, which God has given in the Scriptures, are divinely true. When therefore a Sinner has the &s;ame Apprehen&s;ions about God, his Law, his own Vile|ne&s;s, and the only Way of Salvation by Chri&s;t, as are delivered in the Scriptures; then he is taught by the Spirit&mdash;Such a Man apprehends God to be infinitely excellent and glorious, his Law to mo&s;t pure and holy, worthy of God to reveal; him&s;elf to be un&s;peakeably vile, ungrateful and abominable; yea ju&s;tly liable to God's dreadful Wrath for violating this excellent Law; and that if he were to be condemned to the everla&s;ting Torments of Hell, it is no more than he ju&s;tly de|&s;erves for di&s;honoring a glorious God. He &s;ees that all the Declarations of God are infallibly true. He believes that Te&s;timony which he has borne concerning Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He &s;ees that this glorious Redeemer has laid a &s;ufficient Foundati|on for the Safety of all believing Sinners, that God can be ju&s;t and yet the Ju&s;tifier of every one that believeth in Je&s;us; and that who&s;oever cometh unto Chri&s;t, he will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out|let him be ever &s;o great a Sinner. Thus the Spirit of God teaches Sinners with his Word, bringing them effectually to know and love the Truths which are revealed in the Scriptures, the general Truths of God's holy Word, leading them to have &s;uch Views of Things con&s;idered in them&s;elves, as are given in the Scriptures. If therefore a Man be con&s;cious to him&s;elf, that he apprehends divine Things as they are repre&s;ented in the Scriptures; if he feels him&s;elf duly influenced by the Go&s;pel,
<PB N="64" REF="009120_0042_1030F5B60D74EA70">
that the Life which he now lives in the Fle&s;h, he lives by Faith in the Son of God; then it is evident that he is led by the Spi|rit of God. For <Q>the Go&s;pel is to them that peri&s;h Fool|i&s;hne&s;s.</Q> They never behold its eminent Glory, they are never duly influenced by it. It is only to tho&s;e who are &s;aved, that the Go&s;pel is made the Power of God.</P>
<P>As the Spirit of God teaches Men only general Truths from his Word, he does no more by the Sacraments. There is, I apprehend, an intire Corre&s;pondence between the Declarations of the Word of God and the Sacraments. Seals are u&s;ed among Men to confirm Writings, Bonds, Obligations, &amp;c. Thus, King Aha&s;uerus confirmed his Commands, which he &s;ent to the &s;eve|ral Provinces of his large Empire, not only "by writing them in his own Name," but "by &s;ealing them with his Ring." <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her iii. 12.</NOTE> Now though God's Declarations are worthy of all Acceptation, being &s;ufficiently credible in them&s;elves, becau&s;e of his infallible Truth and Faithfulne&s;s, yet guilty Sinners have many Fears, and are very prone to di&s;tru&s;t his gracious Promi&s;es; &s;o that there is Need of various Sorts of Evidence to induce them to believe, or give hearty Credit to his Go&s;pel. Hence, God has been plea&s;ed in Conde&s;cention to our Weakne&s;s to affix Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper, by Way of Seals to his Go&s;pel or new Covenant. Now it is well known that among Mankind the Seal is affixed to the written Agreement, Bond, Indenture, Co|venant, and to that only. Nothing is confirmed by the Seal, but what is expre&s;&s;ed in the written In&s;trument to which it is affixed. And thus God confirms Nothing by the Sacraments, which are the Seals of the New-Te&s;tament or Covenant, but what he hath written in it. Is it not ab&s;urd to imagine that there can be any Thing &s;ealed or confirmed by the Sacraments, but what is declared in that Covenant and written Word in the Bible to which they are affixed as Seals?</P>
<P>"This Cup, <HI>&s;ays Chri&s;t,</HI> is the New Te&s;tament in my Blood;" <HI>That is,</HI> as commonly explained, the Sacramental-Cup, which repre&s;ents the Blood of Chri&s;t, is the Seal of the New-Te&s;ta|ment or Covenant, which is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Blood of Chri&s;t. God has expre&s;sly declared, that who&s;oever believeth in Chri&s;t &s;hall be &s;aved. This is in brief the New-Covenant. God not only reveals this general Truth in Words, but he &s;ets his Seal
<PB N="65" REF="009120_0042_1030F5B60D74EA70">
to it in the Sacraments; hereby &s;olemnly promi&s;ing he will &s;ave them if they believe in the Sen&s;e of the Go&s;pel. But he does by no Means &s;eal to tho&s;e that partake of the Sacraments, that they have this Faith. For then he would &s;eal &s;omething that is not in the Scriptures, and very frequently &s;eal what is not true in it&s;elf, &s;ince many, who partake of the Sacraments, have not ju&s;tifying Faith.</P>
<P>Men on their Parts promi&s;e to fulfil this New Covenant, or believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This is their Indi&s;pen|&s;ible Duty, agreeable to the general Commands of Chri&s;t to all to repent and believe the Go&s;pel. So that there is no &s;uch Thing, even when gracele&s;s Men partake of the Sacraments, as a Seal's being put to a Blank. Is it not true that God will &s;ave the Receivers if they truly believe? Is it not equally true, that it is the Duty of the Receivers to believe in Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>The Sacraments don't &s;eal Men's &s;aving Intere&s;t in the Co|venant of Grace. They are greatly mi&s;taken who imagine they do, and have yet to learn the proper Notion of Sacraments. Like Circumci&s;ion of old, they are a Seal of the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Faith, a Confirmation that God will &s;ave all who have true Faith. Now it is every one's indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty to believe. God required and commanded, yea he bound the Infants of the Jews to this by Circumci&s;ion of Old. And why may he not bind and oblige Children of Chri&s;tian Parents under the Go&s;|pel to Faith in Chri&s;t? Why &s;hould any de&s;ire to have their Children free from the&s;e Obligations to believe in Chri&s;t? Are they tired with the Yoke of Chri&s;t them&s;elves, that they would have a greater Liberty re&s;erved for their Children to di&s;regard him? Why then are they &s;o loth to dedicate them to him in Bapti&s;m?</P>
<P N="1">i. As it appears to be the Office of the Holy Spirit to en|lighten Men's Minds in the general Truths revealed in the Scriptures, &s;o on the contrary it appears to be one great Arti|fice of Satan, by which, it is to be feared, he deceives many to deal in particular Sugge&s;tions, I mean, impre&s;&s;ing particular Texts on their Minds as if &s;uch Texts had an immediate &s;pecial Referrence to them.

<P>Now &s;uch Texts as they refer to us, teach us, as has been before ob&s;erved, only general Truths, viz. <Q>that God greatly loves his Saints, that he pardons their Sins, and will receive them into his heavenly Kingdom.</Q> But they &s;ay Nothing of you, John, Thomas, Ann, Mary, by Name whither you are Saints or Sinners, beloved or hated. The holy Spirit when he enlightens your Minds in the&s;e Scriptures can never teach you, that you in particular are beloved, &amp;c. becau&s;e there is no &s;uch Truth in them.</P>
<P>When therefore Per&s;ons have it &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on their Minds from the&s;e and the like Scriptures, that they in particu|lar are beloved, elected, pardoned, ju&s;tified; this is entirely a new Revelation, which mu&s;t owe its Origin to an over heared Fancy or the Delu&s;ion of Satan. Per&s;ons mu&s;t fir&s;t believe in Chri&s;t, before they can have any rational Grounds to hope they were elected. They mu&s;t prove their Election, and Ju&s;|tification, by their effectual Calling and Sanctification. Men are &s;aid to be ju&s;tified by Faith in Chri&s;t. Con&s;equently they are not ju&s;tified before they believe in this glorious Saviour. When therefore Per&s;ons have it fir&s;t revealed to them that their Sins are pardoned, and they ju&s;tified; this is a Revelation of a Fal&s;hood, and may therefore be ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to Satan who is the Father of Lies.</P>
<P>Hence, it has been ob&s;erved of &s;uch Converts, that their Minds are not enlightened in the general Truths of the Go&s;|pel, and the Way of Salvation by Chri&s;t by their Di&s;coveries. The grand Thing they can tell is, that they are beloved, elec|ted, ju&s;tified, pardoned; and their Burthen has gone off, and they have been filled with Comfort and Joy, while they ima|gined the Lord manife&s;ted his peculiar Affection for them.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the Force of &s;uch particular Impre&s;&s;ions wear off in &s;ome con&s;iderable Mea&s;ure, they would begin to be a little
<PB N="67" REF="009120_0043_1030F5B79E3B6910">
fearful: But to prevent all Convictions, Satan in&s;tils it into their Minds, that it is a great Sin to <HI>doubt,</HI> and perhaps &s;trong|ly impre&s;&s;es that Text, O thou of little Faith wherefore "did&s;t thou doubt? Thus, they are brought to imagine that true Faith in Chri&s;t is to believe firmly they are in a &s;afe State, and that God has a &s;ingular Regard for them; and that walk|ing by Faith is to maintan without any Evidence a good Con|ceit of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This has been and &s;till is a very common Notion among many Per&s;ons in the Chri&s;tian World. I mu&s;t therefore examine it a little particularly.</P>
<P>It might be of Service, if Men would con&s;ider what is meant in Scrripture by the Word <HI>Doubt,</HI> and to what it is applied in the &s;acred Writings. They might &s;ee that <HI>Doubting</HI> in the Scriptures does not &s;ignify Men's que&s;tioning whether they are in a State of Grace, but whether Je&s;us of Nazareth was the true Me&s;&s;ias; or di&s;tru&s;ting his Power, Truth and Faithfulne&s;s. <Q>O thou of little Faith, wherefore did&s;t thou <HI>doubt, que&s;tion, &s;cruple</HI> my Power to pre&s;erve thee from drowning?</Q></P>
<P>It &s;hould be remembered that the main Que&s;tion which was di&s;puted in the Time of Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles, was whi|ther Je&s;us of Nazareth was the promi&s;ed Saviour. Men were termed Belivers or Unbelievers as they openly profe&s;&s;ed or deni|ed this fundamental Truth of Chri&s;tianity. The believing Samaritans declared thus, <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">John iv. 42. Acts ix 22 John xx. 31. Acts viii 37.</NOTE> <Q>We have heard him our&s;elves, and know that this is Indeed the Chri&s;t, the Saviour of the World.</Q> The great Thing which Paul proved with &s;uch &s;triking Evidence was, "that Je&s;us is the very Chri&s;t." The Go&s;pel was written for this End, that <Q>Men might believe that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, and that believing they might have Life thro' his Name." The Profe&s;&s;ion of the Eunuch was, I believe that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God,</Q> or the pro|mi&s;ed Me&s;&s;ias.</P>
<P>Hence, when Men &s;crupled, did not believe this Truth, they were &s;aid to <HI>doubt.</HI> Thus the Jews, <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">John x. 24. Mat. xxviii. 17.</NOTE> <Q>How long do&s;t thou make us to <HI>doubt?</HI> It thou be the Chri&s;t tell us plain|ly." Thus al&s;o after his Re&s;urrection, "When they &s;aw him they Wor&s;hiped him, but &s;ome doubted,</Q> (or though
<PB N="68" REF="009120_0044_1030F5B92AF27608">
&s;ome had doubted) called in Que&s;tion the Truth of his Re&s;ur|rection.</P>
<P>Your Mi&s;under&s;tanding of the Word <HI>Doubt,</HI> as u&s;ed in the Scriptures, has probably been an Occa&s;ion of your falling into &s;undry Mi&s;takes. While you have fancied the E&s;&s;ence of &s;aving Faith con&s;i&s;ts in being &s;trongly confident that God loves you, and that Chri&s;t died for you in particular, you are ready to pronounce all who have &s;ome Comfort after Convictions to be true Converts. You imagine that if they tell you their Experiences and you have Fellow&s;hip with them, you have a certain infallible Knowledge of their gracious State. Hence, the chief Part of your Conver&s;ation about Religion is employ|ed in telling your religious Experiences. And I &s;uppo&s;e it is from the &s;ame Notion, that you exact an Account of Men's religious Experiences before you receive them into your pretended Churches.</P>
<P>The &s;tanding Mini&s;try in general zealou&s;ly maintain the great Importance and ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of experimental Religion, as our Sermons, and printed Di&s;cour&s;es and Books abundantly te&s;tify. For my own Part, were it not for that Regard which I have for experimental Religion, I &s;hould not have taken &s;o much Pains in my pre&s;ent low State of Health to re&s;cue it from your Mi&s;repre&s;entations, and to warn the World again&s;t tho&s;e Things in your Conduct, which are giving it &s;uch a dead|ly Blow.</P>
<P>Your prenouncing all, who pretend to have Comfort and Joy after Fears and Trrors, to be true Converts is ra&s;h and unwarrantable; and mu&s;t have a pernicious Tendency where|ver your Influence reaches.</P>
<P>How many, who have been enlightened, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, and, like the &s;tony-ground Hearers in the Parable of the Sower, receive the Word with Joy, &s;oon lo&s;e all remarkable Sen&s;e of Religion, and prove them&s;elves by their wicked Practices to be in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s and in the Bonds of Iniquity? Now does it not reflect a Reproach on experimental Religion in the World, when one and another, who made high Preten|&s;ions to it, and were cried up for eminent Chri&s;tians, di&s;|cover they have no &s;erious Regard for Religion at all?</P>
<P>Since it is certain, that there are common as well as &s;aving Operations of the Spirit; that un&s;ound Profe&s;&s;ors may have
<PB N="69" REF="009120_0044_1030F5B92AF27608">
various Changes and Reformations; that many who &s;eem to begin in the Spirit end in the Fle&s;h, <Q>turning with the Dog to his Vomit and with the Sow that was wa&s;hed to her wallowing in the Mire;</Q> &s;hould there not be the utmo&s;t Prudence and Caution u&s;ed in declaring that others by Name are &s;incere Converts? What Nece&s;&s;ity lies upon Chri&s;tians to &s;earch the Hearts of others, and make any Declaration at all, that they are in a gracious State? The Apo&s;tles received thou&s;ands into the Church in a Day upon their profe&s;&s;ing that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t, and treated <Q>all <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Cor i 2</NOTE> in every Place who called upon the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord as vi&s;ible Saints,</Q> though they knew there were many among them who had only the outward Badge of Chri&s;tianity. It is evi|dent the Apo&s;tles did not examine tho&s;e whom they admitted into the Chri&s;tian Church, about their religious Experiences. For it is too ab&s;urd to believe that they could particularly ex|amine three Thou&s;and in a Day. Now if they did not examine them on this Point, but received them on their open Profe&s;|&s;ion of Chri&s;t, how come you to require a particular Relation of Religious Experiences before you will receive any Per&s;on into Communion with you? Where have you any Precept or Example in the Bible for exacting a Relation of Religious Ex|periences, in Order to your admitting them to chri&s;tian Pri|vileges? Did Philip require the Eunuch to relate his Ex|periences before he bapti&s;ed him? Or did he not admini&s;ter this Ordinance to him upon his profe&s;&s;ing hone&s;tly to believe that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was the Son of God? This is the Account the Scripture gives and farther &s;aith not. Now remember it is written <Q>Add thou not to his Words, le&s;t he reprove thee, and thou be found a Liar.</Q></P>
<P>You have been often told (and if I remember right by Pre|&s;ident Edwards among others) that a Declaration of religious Experiences was never in&s;i&s;ted on according to the Scriptures as a Term of Chri&s;tian Communion, nor any In&s;tance of &s;uch a Practice to be found from the Days of Adam to the Death of the Apo&s;tle John. Why don't you leave off this Practice or produce Scripture to defend it? <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">As there is no Controver&s;y in New-England about exa|mining Candidates concerning their religious Experiences, I have no Bu&s;i|ne&s;s and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eddle with any Que&s;tions relating to that Matter.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="009120_0045_1030F5BC720EED18">You pretend to be extremely &s;crupulous &s;ometimes about Things for which, you think, there is no expre&s;s Scripture, as in Infant Bapti&s;m, and keeping the fir&s;t Day of the Week for the Sabbath. It is but rea&s;onable you &s;hould be con&s;i&s;tent with your&s;elves. Therefore I de&s;ire you, to produce the Scrip|ture, the expre&s;s Command or Example, where Per&s;ons were required to declare their &s;ecret religious Experiences in order to their being admitted to Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>As to that Fellow&s;hip and Communion (as you under&s;tand the Words) which you profe&s;s to judge by, when you hear Per&s;ons relate their religious Experiences, it is Nothing but a Sympathy or fellow-feeling with them, &s;o far as their Experi|ences appear to you to agree with your own. And in this Sen&s;e almo&s;t every Per&s;on feels &s;omething like it in the ordi|nary Affairs of Life. Thus, when a true Engli&s;hman hears how his brave Countrymen have beaten the French, the perfi|dious Enemies of Great-Britain, he is immediately intere&s;ted in the Story and has a fellow-feeling with the Engli&s;h Generals and Soldiers in all their Dangers and Victories. And on the contrary a Frenchman &s;ympathi&s;es with his Countrymen. And Men who have &s;trong Connexions, whither from Intere&s;t, Pa&s;|&s;ions or Principles, will have this &s;ympathetic Feeling, which you call Fellow&s;hip and Witne&s;&s;ing for one another.</P>
<P>When you hear a Man tell his religious Experiences, and there happens to be &s;ome Similitude between yours and his, you will have a fellow-feeling with him; and upon a mutual Relation of Experiences, you may confirm one another's Hopes and grow more confident of your good E&s;tates, and imagine you are greatly quickened and enlivened by &s;uch an Interview. And thus if two per&s;ons, who had an implacable Grudge at a third Per&s;on, &s;hould open their Minds to one another, they would have a great Deal of fellow-feeling with one another, and would be more encouraged and confirmed in their Enmity again&s;t him. But can you think that this is what the Scriptures call the Communion of Saints?</P>
<P>To rectify your Mi&s;takes about the Meaning of the Words Communion and Fellow&s;hip of Saints as u&s;ed in Scripture, you may ob&s;erve, that when a Number of Per&s;ons have a common Intere&s;t in any Thing, which is capable of being divided into Parts they have Communion or Fellow&s;hip in that Thing, each
<PB N="71" REF="009120_0045_1030F5BC720EED18">
one receiving his proper Share. Hence the Apo&s;tle &s;peaking of the Lord's Supper &s;ays, <Q>The Cup of Ble&s;&s;ing which we ble&s;s, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chri&s;t? The Bread which we break is it not the Communion of the Body of Chri&s;t? Becau&s;e the Bread is one <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">So it &s;hould be Tran&s;lated. See the Original and Con&s;ult Beza and Whitby on this Text. 1 Cor. x. 16, 17.</NOTE> we many are one Body; for we are all Partakers of that one Bread.</Q> Thus Chri&s;ti|ans according to the Apo&s;tle &s;haring or partaking in the &s;ame Elements of Bread and Wine have Communion or Fellow&s;hip together.</P>
<P>But where the Subject mentioned is not capable of being di|vided, Men have Communion together in Re&s;pect of &s;aid Sub|ject, who each of them have the whole. Saints have all of them, one as well as another, the &s;ame God, the &s;ame Chri&s;t, the &s;ame Holy Gho&s;t, the &s;ame Graces. And thus all Saints have Communion with one another, however di&s;tant they may live as to Time or Place. The Word Communion or Fellow|&s;hip of Saints among them&s;elves is u&s;ed ordinarily in one or the other of the&s;e two Sen&s;es, in the Scriptures. Thus, it appears that the Communion and Fellow&s;hip of the Saints mentioned in the Scriptures is quite a different Thing from your &s;ympathetic-feeling, ari&s;ing from Communication of Experiences. Which Fellow&s;hip you can have only with tho&s;e who tell you their Experien|ces: Whereas all Saints have Communion with one another though they live in different Countries and Ages of the World.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid about the Nature of your fellow-feeling with one another in your mutual relating your Experiences, clearly di&s;covers what Sort of Evidence that is, which you call witne&s;&s;ing for one another's Conver&s;ion. When you have this Fellow&s;hip, this is an Evidence that you have, or pretend to have &s;ome religious Experiences; and that there is &s;ome Si|milarity or Likene&s;s between your Experiences. But it is no certain Proof, that the Man has had tho&s;e Experiences, which he relates. For he may borrow them, for any Thing you can tell, from &s;ome Book that gives an Account of the Life and Experiences of &s;ome excellent Chri&s;tian publi&s;hed from his Diary by his Friends after his Death. You can remember &s;ome In&s;tances in which you have been wretchedly impo&s;ed
<PB N="72" REF="009120_0046_1030F5BE0BA66C00">
on, if you plea&s;e. But &s;uppo&s;e the Per&s;on relates his own Ex|periences, and you have &s;trong Sympathy with him, and he with you; this is no infallible Proof, that either of you have Grace. For may not two Hypocrites have Experiences very like one another? May not a large Number of Hypocrites be deceived by the &s;ame Spirit, and &s;plit on the &s;ame Rock? And have Fellow&s;hip in one another's fal&s;e Experiences?</P>
<P>When you determine Per&s;ons to be in a gracious State <HI>merely</HI> by <HI>your Fellow&s;hip</HI> with them in their religious Experi|ences, does not this open a Door for proud Hypocrites to vaunt them&s;elves, that they may be accounted eminent Chri&s;|tians? And will not the meek, mode&s;t and humble Saint on your Scheme be in Danger of being de&s;pi&s;ed and contemned? Fal&s;e Profe&s;&s;ors, like the Phari&s;ees, are likely to be very for|ward in proclaiming their own Goodne&s;s. They may have &s;trong Fellow&s;hip with one another from the Agreement of their Experiences. Now the Scriptures repre&s;ent, that the greate&s;t Part even of Profe&s;&s;ors are not true Converts. <Q>Ma|ny are called but few cho&s;en.</Q> Many travel the broad Way to De&s;truction, few find the narrow Way that leads to eternal Life. When therefore you receive or reject a Man by your Fellow&s;hip with him, requiring all your Members, Men, Women, Boys and Girls (as your Practice is) to witne&s;s for or again&s;t him, the greater Part of you mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily judge by a fal&s;e Rule; &s;ince every rea&s;onable Man mu&s;t allow, it is more than probable, that at lea&s;t more than half of your elec|tive Body are unconverted, and of Con&s;equence have no right Experiences of their own.</P>
<P>There is a probability that Hypocrites will have Fellow&s;hip with Hypocrites from the &s;amene&s;s of their Experiences. As they are not much re&s;trained by Mode&s;ty and Humility, but ambitious to be accounted eminent Chri&s;tians, their open Freedom and Forwardne&s;s will give them great Influence. But &s;ince the Experiences of true Saints will differ from tho&s;e of Hypocrites, they are not likely to have much Fellow&s;hip with Saints in their Relations. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides there may be con&s;iderable Variety in the Experiences of true Saints. God has not confined him&s;elf exactly in all Re&s;pects to one Method. &amp;c John iii. 8.</NOTE> The humble Mode&s;ty of &s;in|cere Converts will afford a plau&s;ible Pretence for Su&s;picion;
<PB N="73" REF="009120_0046_1030F5BE0BA66C00">
So that they run the Ri&s;que of being received but very coldly, and &s;ometimes of being wholly excluded from your Churches, if you adhere &s;trictly to that Plan you have &s;et up. Thus, your Scheme bids fair to open the Doors of your pretended. Churches for all &s;elfdeceived, proud, forward Hypocrites; and to &s;hut them again&s;t &s;incere humble Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>This Method of yours in &s;etting up religious Experiences as the <HI>only Rule</HI> of judging by, &s;eems to be liable to a very ju&s;t and &s;trong Objection, in that it leads you off from the written Word of God to follow your own &s;ympathetic Feelings with them in their Relations. You don't pretend to know that &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons are converted, becau&s;e their Experiences, which they relate to you, are agreeable to the Account which the Scrip|tures give of the Work of Grace in the Hearts of Saints, and the In&s;tances of Conver&s;ion which are recorded in them; but you pronounce them converted becau&s;e you have a &s;ecret Fel|low&s;hip with them, or becau&s;e you have &s;ome &s;trong Impul&s;e or private Revelation that they are born again. Thus you don't u&s;e the Scriptures as any Rule in forming your Judg|ment about your Converts. No Wonder you pa&s;s many a ra&s;h Judgment. Mu&s;t you not be &s;trangely bewildered who after all can &s;till confidently blunder on in &s;uch gro&s;s Ab|&s;urdities!</P>
<P>Religious Conver&s;ation or Di&s;cour&s;e is doubtle&s;s very pro|fitable, and &s;hould be promoted and practi&s;ed by Chri&s;tians. But I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed at pre&s;ent from thinking, that a per|petual relating of Men's &s;ecret Experiences is much for Edi|fication. Does it not look too much like O&s;tentation? Would it not be much better, when you di&s;cour&s;e about experimental Religion, to enquire, not what you or I have experienced as the Marks of a &s;incere Chri&s;tian; but what God has revealed in his Word about this important Matter. Do Chri&s;tians know Nothing about God, his holy Law, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his Redemption, &amp;c. &amp;c. that they can't furni&s;h out a Conver&s;ation on religious Subjects, without always introducing their own Experiences and Feelings? <Q>Surely, <HI>&s;ays Mr. Bel|lamy,</HI> tho&s;e cannot be &s;aid to <HI>remember God</HI> who are always full of <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> full of a Sen&s;e of their own Goodne&s;s, and are dwelling forever upon their own high Attainments, ready al|ways to &s;ay, God I thank thee I am not as other Men!

<P>One would think, it &s;hould put a mode&s;t Per&s;on to the Blu&s;h, to make him&s;elf, and his great Experiences, the perpetual Sub|ject of his Di&s;cour&s;e. But it is natural for &s;ome always to make <HI>I</HI> the Burden of their Story: However, you &s;ee this is not commended by &s;ome who &s;u&s;tain a religious Character. And why &s;hould you de&s;ire to di&s;cour&s;e about Religion in that Way which expo&s;es your own Characters, and gives Offence to many religious Per&s;ons. Should you not beware of giving Offence?</P>
<P>Your Method of talking religious Experiences, and judging by them, furni&s;hes &s;ome, as they think, with a &s;pecious Pre|tence to &s;earch and try tho&s;e they don't love; as al&s;o to cen&s;ure and condemn tho&s;e who don't incline to &s;ubmit to their Ex|amination. Some &s;uch are known to ride up and down the Country, requiring Per&s;ons, e&s;pecially Mini&s;ters, to give them an Account of their religious Experiences. Some Time ago a Fellow, who was an utter Stranger to me, called at my Hou&s;e, and immediately addre&s;&s;ed me thus. <Q>As I under&s;tand you are the Mini&s;ter of this Pari&s;h I want to a&s;k you one or two Que&s;tions.</Q> I told him he might a&s;k as many rea&s;onable Que&s;tions as he plea&s;ed. Then he proceeded without further Ceremony. <Q>Do you look upon your&s;elf to be in a Sate of Grace? What are your religious Experiences?</Q> I an&s;wered him; his Que&s;tions appeared to me very improper, both as he was an intire Stranger whom I had never &s;een nor heard of before, and as he was not inve&s;ted with any proper Autho|rity, that I knew of, to make &s;uch Enquiries, and therefore I &s;hould not an&s;wer them. Upon this he went off &s;aying he be|lieved I had no Grace. This extraordinary Vi&s;it led me to enquire what Sort of a Man he was, from which I &s;oon found he was a Man of a very had moral Character.</P>
<P>Such Sort of Treatment and Enquiries excited me to &s;earch the Scriptures, whether there was any Foundation in them for &s;uch Practices. But upon the mo&s;t diligent Search, I have
<PB N="75" REF="009120_0047_1030F5C489352D80">
not di&s;covered any Pa&s;&s;age, that warrants Chri&s;tians thus to demand an Account of other's religious Experiences. The Pa&s;&s;ages that have been chiefly in&s;i&s;ted on as Proofs for &s;uch a Practice, I think, are two. The fir&s;t is the Words of the P&s;almi&s;t, <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lxvi. 16.</NOTE> <Q>Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my Soul.</Q> Your Unac|quaintedne&s;s with Languages may incline you to be very con|fident that this Text favours your Notions. But I apprehend there is no certain Evidence, that the P&s;almi&s;t had any Refer|rence to his religious Experiences in the&s;e Words. According to the Idiom of the Hebrew Language, the Word, which our Tran&s;lators have rendered <HI>Soul,</HI> very often &s;ignifies the Per&s;on him&s;elf. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Exod. i. 5. P&s;alm iii. 2. P&s;alm cxliii 12.</NOTE> Thus all the Souls that came out of the Loins of Jacob were &s;eventy Souls, <HI>that is,</HI> &s;eventy Per&s;ons. So the P&s;almi&s;t him&s;elf, <Q>Many there be which &s;ay of <HI>my Soul</HI> i e. of me, there is no Help for him in God.</Q> <Q>De&s;troy all them that afflict <HI>my Soul</HI> i. e. me, for I am thy Servant.</Q> Hence, perhaps the Words under Con&s;ideration might have been as pro|perly tran&s;lated, <HI>I will declare what he hath done for me,</HI> and the Clau&s;e referred to the temporal Deliverances, which he celebrates in this P&s;alm; at lea&s;t there is no Certainty that this is not the Sen&s;e of the Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>But if it were certain, that the P&s;almi&s;t in the&s;e Words had a Referrence to religious Experiences, the Text would even then be far enough from countenancing your Practice. For he does not require others to relate their &s;ecret Experiences to him, but profe&s;&s;es his Readine&s;s to declare to &s;uch as were looked on as Fearers of the Lord, the Experiences he had on that remarkable Occa&s;ion. He did not give this Account of his Experiences to &s;atisfy any Body about his gracious State, to give them any Light about his being a true Saint. For he was a Saint and treated as &s;uch long before he wrote this P&s;alm. So that all that can be inferred from the Text taken in this Sen&s;e, is, that a Chri&s;tian may relate his Experiences, when he has Rea&s;on to think it will be for Edification, which mu&s;t be left to his own di&s;cretion, conducted agreeable to the general Rules of the Word. There is nothing in this Text to warrant your requiring and demanding Per&s;ons to relate

their Experiences to you, on Pain of being cen&s;ured and con|demned as gracele&s;s Wretches and Hypocrites.</P>
<P>It may be of great Advantage and Service to the Church of Chri&s;t, for Chri&s;tians to relate their religious Experiences on proper Occa&s;ions. The Lives of excellent Chri&s;tians that are written with Judgment are of great Service and contain much u&s;eful In&s;truction. And to relate Experiences on &s;ome very important Occa&s;ions may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure an&s;wer the &s;ame End. When Per&s;ons labour under great Troubles, Difficulties, Darkne&s;s, Temptations, &amp;c. it might often be of great Ad|vantage to them to open their Minds freely to their Mini&s;ter, or to &s;ome judicious Chri&s;tian in who&s;e Prudence and Secrecy they could confide. But to have religious Troubles and Experi|ences blazed abroad, and to&s;&s;ed about on the Tongues of the carele&s;s World mu&s;t, I think, have no good Tendency. Such open Proclamation of Experiences puffs up ignorant and proud Profe&s;&s;ors. It fixes the Eyes and Attention of the World on them to keep a narrow Watch, to wait for their Halting; &s;o that when they fall into any Mi&s;carriages this proves a Stum|bling Block, and thus Experimental Religion is brought into Contempt. <Q>Such a one, <HI>&s;ay they,</HI> was converted to'ther Month or Year, &s;ee how he behaves now, we always tho't Preten&s;ions to Conver&s;ion and Grace were Nothing, but mere Cant and Hypocri&s;y.</Q> Now can you think &s;uch Things are likely to promote Religion?</P>

He recommends this as an excellent Pre&s;ervative from Reproaches, Sufferings and Per&s;ecutions. However he hints, that let them be ever &s;o prudent and peaceable, it might &s;o happen, they &s;hould meet with various Troubles and Afflicti|ons from the Enemies of the Chri&s;tian Religion; and he com|forts them with this. <Q>If ye &s;uffer for Righteou&s;ne&s;s Sake, happy <HI>are ye;</HI> and be not afraid of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">err<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, neither be

<P>You &s;ee the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of two Sorts of Men in this Pa&s;|&s;age, profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians and their open Enemies, that accu&s;ed and per&s;ecuted them. He gives the Chri&s;tians a Direction in the&s;e Words for their Conduct towards their open Enemies, whither profe&s;&s;ed Jews or Heathens. Now can any &s;ober un|prejudiced Per&s;ons think, the Apo&s;tle could direct Chri&s;tians to tell their &s;ecret religious Experiences to the profe&s;&s;ed Unbelievers, who fal&s;ely accu&s;ed and per&s;ecuted them? Would it not be &s;en&s;i|bly ab&s;urd for a &s;erious Chri&s;tian now a Days to relate his religi|ous Experiences to a reproaching Dei&s;t or Indian?</P>
<P>As Je&s;us of Nazareth was proved to be the true Me&s;&s;ias and Saviour of the World, by the mo&s;t glorious Evidence of Miracles; and by fulfilling the Prophe&s;ies of the Old Te&s;ta|ment, &amp;c. it was a mo&s;t rea&s;onable Thing, that all, who pro|fe&s;&s;ed to believe in him, &s;hould be always ready to &s;hew the Rea&s;ons why they believed, hoped and tru&s;ted in him. If any of their Enemies &s;hould a&s;k them a Rea&s;on or Di&s;cour&s;e of the Hope that was in them, de&s;iring them to &s;hew why they be|lieved that Je&s;us of Nazareth was the Chri&s;t; Nothing could be more rea&s;onable than to &s;et before them the Evidences of the Chri&s;tian Religion. Thus Paul &s;peaks of his being <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiii. 6.</NOTE> <Q>called in Que&s;tion of the Hope and Re&s;urrection of the Dead.</Q> He was ready to &s;hew the Rea&s;ons of his embracing Chri&s;ti|anity. And all, who call them&s;elves by the Name of Chri&s;t, &s;hould be &s;o well acquainted with the Doctrines and Evidences of our holy Religion, as to be ready to &s;hew every one that a&s;ks them in a &s;ober Manner, &s;ome &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons, why they believe Je&s;us of Nazareth to be the Chri&s;t, and hope and tru&s;t in him. For I pre&s;ume the Text has not changed its Sen&s;e by Length of Time. The Direction is &s;till Impor|tant.</P>
<P>'Tis certain that the Apo&s;tles had the highe&s;t Regard for ex|perimental

Religion. They well knew that unle&s;s Men have right Experiences, they can't have true Religion. Yet they were not forward in relating their own extraordinary Expe|riences. They ob&s;erve the greate&s;t Mode&s;ty and Decorum, when they were obliged to &s;ay any Thing about them&s;elves. But the fal&s;e Teachers, who oppo&s;ed the Apo&s;tles, were very forward in recommending them&s;elves, and boa&s;ting of their great Attainments. In Oppo&s;ition to the&s;e Deceivers, St. Paul found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething about him&s;elf, his Labours, Sufferings, Vi&s;ions and Revelations; yet he does it in &s;uch a Manner, (as Dr. Doddridge ju&s;tly ob&s;erves) as plainly &s;hews how di&s;agreeable it was to him, &s;o much as &s;eem to applaud him&s;elf on the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Occa&s;ions Mo&s;t remarkable is the Apology <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xi. 12.</NOTE> of the Apo&s;tle, <Q>I &s;ay&mdash;Let no Man, think me a Fool; if otherwi&s;e yet as a Fool receive me, that I may boa&s;t my&s;elf a little. That which I &s;peak, I &s;peak <HI>it</HI> not after the Lord, but as it were fooli&s;hly in this Confidence of Boa&s;ting. Seeing that many glory after the Fle&s;h, I will glory al&s;o, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q> &mdash;It is not expedient for me doubtle&s;s to glory, I will come to Vi&s;ions and Revelations of the Lord.&mdash;I am become a Fool in glorying, ye have compelled me. Thus he &s;hews it was with the greate&s;t Re|luctance that he &s;aid any Thing about his own Experiences. How widely different was the Temper and Conduct of the Apo&s;tles, from that which prevails among you who are always harping on your own great Experiences!</P>
<P>Tho' there can be no &s;incere chri&s;tian Piety without experi|mental Acquaintance with God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t by the Spirit, yet a Relation of religious Experiences is not made the grand Evidence of the Sincerity of Men's Profe&s;&s;ion, in the Scriptures. When Chri&s;t recommends it to his Di&s;ciples to prove their Holine&s;s to the World, he does not direct them to convince them by telling their &s;ecret Experiences, and &s;weet Communion which they had with God; but, <Q>Let <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Matt. v. 16.</NOTE> your Light &s;o &s;hine before Men, that they may &s;ee your good Works and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</Q> Hence, <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">James ii 18.</NOTE> that of the Apo&s;tle James, <Q>I will &s;hew thee my Faith by my Works.</Q> Others may do what they plea&s;e,

and appoint what Marks they will of their having &s;aving Faith, and being true Chri&s;tians; but as for me, I look upon good Works to be the be&s;t Evidence, <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">See Pre&s;ident Edwards on Religious Affections la&s;t Part.</NOTE> I will &s;hew my Faith by my Works. <Q>In this, <HI>&s;ays the Apo&s;tle John,</HI> the Children of God are manife&s;t and the Children of the Devil.</Q> How are they manife&s;t? By the Relation of their religious Experiences to the World? No, by their good Works. For thus he proceeds and informs us, <Q>Whoever doth not Righteou&s;ne&s;s is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Brother.&mdash; He that doth Righteou&s;ne&s;s is righteous even as he is righ|teous.</Q> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 3&mdash; 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>Where you have pronounced a Per&s;on to be converted from your Fellow&s;hip with his Experiences, your Credit as a Par|ty, and as a pure Church that con&s;i&s;ts only of gracious Per|&s;ons, naturally leads you to warn him again&s;t examining and doubting his Conver&s;ion; &s;o that though he &s;hould not <HI>do</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s, nor &s;hew his Faith by his Works, nor bring forth good Fruits, yet he mu&s;t not &s;cruple his Ju&s;tification. If by any Means he &s;hould &s;u&s;pect he was yet unconverted, then all your Art and Indu&s;try mu&s;t be u&s;ed to per&s;uade him, he is troubled with the Temptations of Satan, and that he mu&s;t believe he is converted. Your Conduct in &s;ome In&s;tan|ces of this Kind is well known.</P>
<P>We read of Seducers of Old, who in a Ca&s;e &s;omething like this, cried <Q>Peace, and there is no Peace; one built up a Wall and lo, others daubed it with untempered Mortar.

<P>'Tis indeed true, that the Apo&s;tles &s;peak of the Churches in their Time as con&s;i&s;ting of Saints. This was a Name which was given to all Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ors. Chri&s;tians in the Apo&s;tle's Times profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;t, in Oppo&s;ition to the whole World, in the Face of the greate&s;t Dangers, and &s;evere&s;t Per&s;ecutions.
<PB N="80" REF="009120_0050_1030F5CAE42F5DE0">
There was a &s;trong Pre&s;umption that many of them were &s;incere Saints, e&s;pecially that the Influences of the Holy Spirit were poured out in a remarkable Manner. Be&s;ides, all who profe&s;|&s;ed Je&s;us to be the Chri&s;t were immediately baptized, and thus publickly &s;anctified or con&s;ecrated to God, and inli&s;ted among the Di&s;ciples of his Son. They belonged to the vi&s;ible Church and Hou&s;hold of Faith, and are called <HI>Brethren.</HI> And thus as the World before the Coming of Chri&s;t was divided into Jews and Gentiles, &s;o under the New-Te&s;tament it is vi&s;ibly divided into profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians and open Unbelievers, tho&s;e that acknowledge Chri&s;t, and tho&s;e who deny him, as Jews, Hea|thens, and Dei&s;ts. The Apo&s;tle comprehends the whole World under tho&s;e who were <HI>without</HI> and tho&s;e who were <HI>within</HI> the vi&s;ible Church. <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. v. 12, 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Inferences you &s;hould draw from this, is to treat all profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians as Saints in Proportion as they &s;hew the Sincerity of their Faith by their good Works. But you are certainly extremely mi&s;taken, when you pretend to prove, from the Apo&s;tles addre&s;&s;ing the Churches to whom they wrote by the Name of Saints, that they looked on them collectively to be real Saints.</P>
<P>They well remembered that Chri&s;t had taught them it was his Will, that when there are Tares in the &s;ame Field with the Wheat, the Servants &s;hould not pull them up. They were al&s;o well acquainted with the Parable of the Sower, and the &s;tony and thorny Ground Hearers. They &s;peak of <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xi. 26. Gal. ii. 4.</NOTE> "fal&s;e Brethren." It is &s;uppo&s;ed by Paul, <Q>that a Man that was called a Brother might be a Fornicator, covetous, and an Idolater, a Railer, a Drunkard, an Extortioner.</Q> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. v. 11.</NOTE> While &s;uch a Man concealed his Vices, and brought no public Scandal on the Church, he was not to be ca&s;t out. But when he brought a public Reproach on the Church by his vi&s;ible ill Life, he was to be di&s;ciplined; and if he refu&s;ed to repent, and give chri&s;tian Satisfaction, he was to be excommunicated. But no Per&s;on was ever to be ca&s;t out of the vi&s;ible Church, merely becau&s;e he had not &s;aving Grace. The Crimes for which they were to be excommunicated were publick, &s;uch as could be proved upon Oath by credible Per&s;ons. <Q>In the

Whereas, if he knew he was guilty of &s;uch and &s;uch public Crimes, he could bear Witne&s;s again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tles were not deceived by Per&s;ons, who proved to be wicked, as Simon Magus, &amp;c. For it does not appear that they formed any Judgment about their being &s;incerely gracious. They did not examine them about their religious Experiences, nor bapti&s;e them in Con&s;equence of having Fel|low&s;hip with them in &s;uch Relations. If they had, they mu&s;t have taken up a great Deal of Time in examining, judging and witne&s;&s;ing for them who pre&s;ented them&s;elves. It would have taken them at lea&s;t two or three Months to have admit|ted the three Thou&s;and on this Plan. But we know they re|ceived them in le&s;s than a Day.</P>
<P>If the Apo&s;tles had received none into the Church but &s;uch as they had examined and approved as &s;incere Saints, their own Credit and Characters would have &s;uffered extremely, when any of them apo&s;tati&s;ed, as &s;undry of them did. How could they have per&s;uaded &s;ober thinking Per&s;ons, they were divinely in&s;pired, if they had been daily forming fal&s;e Judg|ments about Per&s;ons. They would perhaps have been temp|ted, like you, to have per&s;uaded them, they were &s;till in a State of Grace. But in&s;tead of this we find they a&s;&s;ured all Profe&s;&s;ors, who did not bring forth the Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;hew the Sincerity of their Faith by their Works, that they were as de&s;titute of &s;aving Grace as the Devils. The Apo&s;tle Paul &s;peaking of profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians &s;ays, <Q>Many walk of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weep|ing, that they are the Enemies of the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, who&s;e End is De&s;truction, who&s;e God is their Belly, and who&s;e Glo|ry is in their Shame, who mind earthly Things.</Q> <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Philip. iii. 18, 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>As the Apo&s;tles received Per&s;ons into the vi&s;ible Church up|on their profe&s;&s;ing to believe that Je&s;us of Nazareth was the Chri&s;t, their Apo&s;tacy and Wickedne&s;s brought no Di&s;grace on the Apo&s;tles. We never find their Enemies upbraiding
<PB N="82" REF="009120_0051_1030F5CC803BE7F0">
and reproaching them for being mi&s;taken in their Judgment about tho&s;e whom they received when they proved naughty. None were &s;o ready to point out, and reprove hypocritical Pro|fe&s;&s;ors, as the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves. The Notion of a vi&s;ible Church that &s;hall con&s;i&s;t only of &s;incere Saints in this World never entred into their Heads. It is not the De&s;ign of Chri&s;t to erect &s;uch a Church in this World. It is <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 37,&mdash;50.</NOTE> not till the End of the World that <Q>the Son of Man &s;ends forth his Angels, to gather out of his Kingdom all Things that offend, and them which do Iniquity.&mdash;The Kingdom of Heaven or <HI>the vi&s;ible Church in this World</HI> is like unto a Net that was ca&s;t into the Sea, and gathered of every Kind; which when it was full they drew to Shore, and &s;at down, gathered the good into Ve&s;&s;els, but ca&s;t the bad away. So &s;hall it be at the End of the World, the Angels &s;hall come forth and &s;ever or &s;eparate the wicked from among the ju&s;t, &amp;c.</Q> Thus the Separation between the Righteous and the Wicked is not to take Place to the End of the World.</P>
<P>Thus your Pretences to certain and infallible Knowledge of one another's States, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> up a Church of &s;incere Saints in this World are contrary to the expre&s;s Directions of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Does it not look like vain Pre&s;umption, or in&s;ufferable Pride for Men to pretend to &s;earch the Hearts and try the Reins? Your Notion of &s;uch a Church is a <HI>certain</HI> Evidence that you are very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mi&s;taken, and mu&s;t have a dreadful Tendency <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en Hypocrites, whom you re|ceive under the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of true Saints.

<P>If &s;ome who are vi&s;ibly unholy and &s;candalous, did not take Shelter among you to e&s;cape Cen&s;ures for their immoral Prac|tices, one would hope you were more hone&s;t in your Preten&s;i|ons, to &s;o much greater Purity. In all probability they would not be &s;o fond of you, if you would faithfully remon&s;trate again&s;t their &s;candalous Practices. But to proceed,</P>
<P>Since there was no Man received into the Go&s;pel Church without profe&s;&s;ing and believing that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t, and &s;ince it is certain that many who thus believed were not
<PB N="83" REF="009120_0051_1030F5CC803BE7F0">
in a State of Salvation; it plainly follows that a mere A&s;&s;ent to this Truth, or even to the Go&s;pel is not &s;aving Faith.</P>
<P>Different Men may believe the Go&s;pel from Different Cau&s;es and Motives. Some <HI>don't doubt</HI> of the Truth of it, becau&s;e their Parents told them &s;o. Others a&s;&s;ent to the Go&s;pel from much the &s;ame Inducements, as they believe any other Hi&s;tory. Men believe other ancient Hi&s;tories, &s;uch as Cae&s;ars Commen|taries, Tacitus, Jo&s;ephus, &amp;c. at lea&s;t many Things in them, without &s;eeing any &s;pecial Glory or Beauty in them, though they are not the tenth Part &s;o well atte&s;ted as the Go&s;pel. Have not the Scriptures been abundantly confirmed by &s;uch infallible Proofs, as mu&s;t force the A&s;&s;ent of every rational Per&s;on who carefully examines them without Prejudice? What &s;hould hinder Men from believing the Go&s;pel Hi&s;tory upon merely rational Evidences, without &s;eeing that eminent Glory in it, which the Spirit of God di&s;covers to true Saints at their Conver&s;ion? But though Men may truly a&s;&s;ent to the Go&s;pel from &s;undry Cau&s;es, yet the Spirit of God is beyond Compa|ri&s;on the highe&s;t and mo&s;t excellent Cau&s;e; and con&s;equently that Faith which he works in Men by his &s;aving Operations, mu&s;t be the mo&s;t excellent. Hence, no Man can in this high|e&s;t and mo&s;t important Sen&s;e, believe and &s;ay that Je&s;us is the Lord but by the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>Yet it is certain from the Go&s;pel Hi&s;tory, that many belie|ved, who were Strangers to the &s;aving Operations of the Spirit. <Q>Many, <HI>&s;ays the Evangeli&s;t John,</HI> believed in his Name, when they &s;aw the Miracles which he did. But Je&s;us did not com|mit him&s;elf unto them, becau&s;e he knew all Men.</Q> The Stony-Ground Hearers are repre&s;ented in the Parable as receiv|ing the Word with Joy, which implies at lea&s;t their a&s;&s;enting to it as true; otherwi&s;e they would not have been &s;o much affected with it. What we don't believe does not move our Pa&s;&s;ions. Ananias and Sapphira were received into the Church upon this Belief: Simon Magus believed; yet they di&s;covered by their not bringing forth the Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that they had not &s;aving Faith, but were in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s and Bonds of Iniquity. <Q>I know, <HI>&s;aid Paul to Agrippa the almo&s;t Chri&s;tian,</HI> thou believe&s;t the Prophets.</Q> And certainly, it was as difficult to believe the divine Te&s;timony in the Prophets, as in the Go&s;pel. Was it only a Lie that Agrippa believed,
<PB N="84" REF="009120_0052_1030F5CFC5623450">
in&s;tead of the Prophets? Does not the Apo&s;tle James evidently &s;uppo&s;e, that Men might a&s;&s;ent to the Truth of the Go&s;pel, and yet have no more Grace than the Devils? <NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">See Pre&s;ident Edwards's and Pre&s;ident D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> James ii. 19, 20. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

<P>How ab&s;urd then is Barclay, in &s;aying, that <Q>the &s;piritual Truths of the Go&s;pel are as Lies in the Mouths of carnel and un&s;piritual Men?</Q> Why did not Paul tell Agrippa &s;o? Why did not James tell tho&s;e to whom he wrote that they only lied, when they profe&s;&s;ed to believe?</P>
<P>Yet this Ab&s;urdity is a darling Topick with many of you, on which you lay great Stre&s;s. For proceeding upon this gro&s;s Mi&s;take, you charge all who enter into Covenant in our Churches without certain and infallible A&s;&s;urance of their Con|ver&s;ion, with Lying; and that Mini&s;ters not only allow but urge their Hearers to lie to God. One, who hears you di&s;|cour&s;e on this Point, as I have often done, would be inclined to &s;u&s;pect, you had never read and con&s;idered the xxix Chap|ter of Deuteronomy, where God expre&s;sly commanded the whole Nation of the I&s;raelites to enter into Covenant with him, that he might be to them a God, as he had &s;worn unto their Fathers, Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob. Were the I&s;raelites, who were commanded to enter thus into Covenant with God, all a&s;&s;ured of their gracious State? If they imagined they were truly converted, they were under an awful Delu&s;ion. For Mo|&s;es plainly a&s;&s;ured them, <Q>the Lord had not given them an Heart to perceive, and Eyes to &s;ee, or Ears to hear unto this Day;</Q> &s;o that he looked on the general Part of them to be unconverted. Yet that very Day they were all to enter into Covenant with God in a vi&s;ible, explicit, &s;olemn Manner, le&s;t any &s;hould imagine they &s;hould e&s;cape the terrible Ven|gence denounced in the Law again&s;t tho&s;e that pre&s;umed to tran&s;gre&s;s. If it had been unlawful for unconverted Per&s;ons, to enter into vi&s;ible Covenant with God, why did not the Lord plainly tell the I&s;raelites &s;o? Why did he not command Mo&s;es to warn them again&s;t this vi&s;ible Covenanting, &s;ince you reckon it a mo&s;t dreadful Sin? If your Nations were right, is it not the mo&s;t unaccountable and a&s;toni&s;hing Thing, that ever was heard of, that he &s;hould command them thus

The xxix of Deuteronomy is expre&s;s and plain: For it was de&s;igned to be immediately under&s;tood and obeyed by the whole Nation, Men, Women and Children, and therefore it mu&s;t have been level to the lowe&s;t Capacities. This Scrip|ture may be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of the plaine&s;t in the whole Bible. Now it is a &s;afe Rule, when two Scriptures treat of the &s;ame Thing, to explain that one, which is more &s;hort and ob&s;cure, by the other which is more full and plain. Since therefore it is certain from Mo&s;es, that God expre&s;sly required and commanded all without Exception, to enter into Covenant with him, and that they under&s;tood and practi&s;ed accordingly, the P&s;almi&s;t mu&s;t be interpreted in &s;uch a Sen&s;e as is con&s;i&s;tent with this, unle&s;s you would &s;uppo&s;e there are real Contradic|tions in the Scriptures, which would be the Way to undermine their Authority altogether. Hence, the De&s;ign of the P&s;al|mi&s;t in the Text you object, mu&s;t be to reprove the Jews, not for entring into Covenant with God, which he had commanded them, but for breaking their &s;acred Bonds by their wicked Lives, or perhaps the P&s;almi&s;t refers to open profane Sinners who were to be excommunicated.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t put a &s;imilar Con&s;truction on &s;undry Scriptures, &s;uch as <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah i. 12, 13.</NOTE> <Q>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your Hand to tread my Courts?

The Expre&s;&s;ions of the Prophet are as &s;trong as tho&s;e of the P&s;almi&s;t.

<P>If Men may a&s;&s;ent to the Truth of the Go&s;pel, as James &s;uppo&s;es, without &s;aving Grace, where has God forbidden them openly to profe&s;s this their Belief?

<P><PB N="87" REF="009120_0053_1030F5D4B4C0BED8">The fir&s;t Ju&s;tification according to them is the Infu&s;ion of Communication unto us of an holy Principle, the Ha|bit of Grace or Charity, by which Original Sin is extin|gui&s;hed, and all the Habits of Sin expelled. This fir&s;t Ju&s;|tification they &s;ay, is by Faith, <HI>that is,</HI> a mere A&s;&s;ent to the Truth of the Go&s;pel, the Obedience and Satisfaction of Chri&s;t being the only meritorious Cau&s;e thereof. So that to be ju&s;|tified by Faith according to them is to have the Mind rightly prepared by this Kind of believing to receive an Habit of Grace expelling Sin and making us acceptable to God. For, upon this believing or a&s;&s;enting to the Go&s;pel, with tho&s;e other Duties of Contrition and Repentance, which mu&s;t accom|pany it, they &s;ay it is meet and congruous unto divine Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s and Faithfulne&s;s to give us that Grace, whereby we are finally ju&s;tified. For their &s;econd or final Ju&s;tification is a Con&s;equence hereof, the proper formal Cau&s;e of which is good Works, proceeding from this Princi|ple of Grace and Love. Hence Men's own good Works ac|cording to the Papi&s;ts, are <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> wherewith Believers are righteous before God, whereby they merit Heaven.</P>
<P>But according to the Doctrine of all &s;ound Prote&s;tants, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>that is,</HI> what he did and &s;uffered, is <HI>that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or which</HI> we are ju&s;tified before God. This is the grand Difference between Papi&s;ts, and Prote&s;tants. It is well known that it was chiefly on Account of Ju&s;tification by Faith alone, the fir&s;t Reformers &s;eparated from the Church of Rome.</P>
<P>Antinomians and Enthu&s;ia&s;ts would fain have it believed, that they are the mo&s;t Orthodox in Point of Ju&s;tification. And they &s;eem at fir&s;t View to run into the oppo&s;ite Extreme to the Papi&s;ts. But if they are clo&s;ely examined, many of them, I believe would be found to have pretty much the &s;ame Noti|ons with the Papi&s;ts on this grand Fundamental Doctrine of a Sinner's Ju&s;tification before God. They commonly place Faith in a mere A&s;&s;ent of the Mind. Their Scheme of experimen|tal Religion nece&s;&s;arily requires this, &s;ince it is all &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from God's revealing his Love to them in Particular. In this they e&s;&s;entially agree with the Papi&s;ts, only that they don't &s;eem to be quite &s;o orthodox. For the Papi&s;ts &s;ay, Faith is an A&s;&s;ent to the Truths of the Go&s;pel.

To correct this Mi&s;take it may be ob&s;erved in brief, That &s;ince it is certain Mankind have broken God's Holy Law by their Sins, they mu&s;t of Con&s;equence be expo&s;ed to its Penalty or Cur&s;e. <Q>For <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 10.</NOTE> cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all Things written in the Book of the Law to do them.</Q> This Penalty or Cur&s;e is Nothing le&s;s than Eter|nal Death, the everla&s;ting Wrath of God in Hell.

Now a Law when it is broken does not admit of Repentance or any Thing that the Breaker of it can do, as a Reparation for violating it. Repen|tance how true and &s;incere &s;oever it may be, an&s;wers neither the Precept nor the Penalty of the Law. The Law requires and demands perfect, &s;inle&s;s Obedience from fir&s;t to la&s;t, or Puni&s;hment. This is all that Law &s;ays to Mankind. Hence "by <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 20</NOTE> the Works of the Law," by any Duties which &s;inful Men can perform to it, "no Man can be ju&s;tified."

<P N="1">1.

Doth God ever thoroughly di&s;cover a Man's Sin and Mi&s;ery to him, and take his Heart from all Creatures and fal&s;e Refuges, by &s;hewing him Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his glorious Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and yet leave his Soul unrenewed and unholy? I believe for my Part, that where the Work of Conver&s;ion is &s;incere, there it is entire. Sinners having by their Apo&s;tacy from God become unholy, they mu&s;t be &s;anctified as well as ju&s;tified. Sin has perverted their Ta&s;te and Reli&s;h for true Holine&s;s and the Happine&s;s which it affords, and thus they are become unfit for the King|dom of Heaven as well as expo&s;ed to Hell.</P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;t is a compleat Saviour. He &s;aves his People from their Sins, and recovers them to Holine&s;s, as well as delivers them from Hell.

Why &s;hould not the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t influence the Will as well as the Under&s;tand|ing, when it is beheld in its Glory? And if it does mu&s;t it not be wrong to confine Faith merely to the A&s;&s;ent of the Under&s;tanding in the grand Bu&s;ine&s;s of clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t? But indeed the Antinomian Faith does not imply a Soul's re|ceiving Chri&s;t or clo&s;ing with him. It is only an A&s;&s;ent to their own good E&s;tate upon &s;ome imaginary Revelation or De|lu&s;ion.

As he was naturally proud, and could not brook Oppo&s;ition, he was really very warm again&s;t all who did not become his Followers and celebrate his Prai&s;es: But his burning Zeal never framed higher, than when he declaimed again&s;t the &s;tanding Mini&s;ters, which he did almo&s;t every Time he held forth, becau&s;e they &s;hewed the People the A&s;&s;urdity and Sinfulne&s;s of &s;uch Conduct, and thus prevented the Spread of his Fame. To give a Sanc|tion to all his Exhortations, he pretended that he always &s;pake by the Spirit, and profe&s;&s;ed to live in the full A&s;&s;urance of his Ju&s;tification. And indeed he was never much di&s;po&s;ed to que&s;tion his own Goodne&s;s. Accordingly he taught it was one of the greatest Sins for Chri&s;tians to doubt of their Conver&s;ion, or &s;cruple that God loved them. He defined Faith in Chri&s;t to be a Man's believing that Chri&s;t died for him in particular, &s;o that for a Man to doubt of his good E&s;tate was the awful Sin of Unbelief. Hence, he de&s;pi&s;ed all Marks and Signs of Grace, and depended for A&s;&s;urance on immediate Revelations of &s;trong Impul&s;es, which he called the immediate Witne&s;s of the Spirit. Had he not adopted this Notion of A&s;&s;urance, he could never have maintained his Confidence, becau&s;e he was very deficient in mo&s;t of the &s;cripture Marks of a Chri&s;tian. For In&s;tance, he was not meek and humble. He was not kind to Mankind in general. He confined any Love he had for Mankind to his own Party, and was cen&s;orious and unkind to all Christians of other Denominations, let them be never &s;o exemplary in their Practices. He rejoiced in the Iniquities and Scan|dals of &s;uch as belonged to the &s;tanding Churches, e&s;pecially of the Mi|ni&s;ters, and was very ready to mi&s;repre&s;ent their Conduct in Order to blacken their Characters and rai&s;e Prejudices again&s;t them. How|ever, as he never examined him&s;elf by the Scripture Marks of a Saint, the&s;e Things never &s;haked his Confidence. A great Sen&s;e of his eminent Labours and Services in the Go&s;pel, his burning Zeal, the Reproaches

<P>Now what can be plainer than that D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">otrephes's religious Exerci&s;es were directed and influenced in a great Mea&s;ure, from fir&s;t to la&s;t by Satan's Sugge&s;tions? His fir&s;t De&s;pair, doubtle&s;s ro&s;e from this Quarter, &s;ince the Texts that were improved were evidently perverted, being applied as if they had a parti|cular, immediate Referrence to him, when it is certain they be|longed no more to him than to others. Thus Satan frequent|ly tries to drive Per&s;ons into De&s;pair, &s;ugge&s;ting to them they are guilty of the Sin again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, or that their Day of Grace is pa&s;t, or their Sins are too great to be forgiven; all which Apprehen&s;ions have no Foundation in the Word of God, but depend entirely on particular Sugge&s;tions or on the Mi&s;application of &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture. God declares re|peatedly, that he will pardon the greate&s;t Sinners if they be|lieve.</P>
<P>If Satan can thus fill Men with Horror, why may he not, if permitted, tran&s;port them with imaginary Joys, mi&s;applying the Promi&s;es to them. Certainly this would have a great Ten|dency to deceive them. He would act as much in the Cha|racter of the Deceiver, by taking this Method, as any other. Why may not God permit him to take this Method as well as the other?</P>
<P>If Diotrephes had really loved the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, it does not appear that he had any ju&s;t Occa&s;ion of &s;eparating. Certainly he &s;hould have tried all Mea&s;ures before he proceeded to rent the Church of Chri&s;t. The Sin of Schi&s;m is far from being &s;mall.</P>
<P>Where Per&s;ons withdraw from that Religion, which is profe&s;|&s;ed in general where they live, this turns the Attention of many from the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, to know what they are driving at. Such Per&s;ons, let the Cau&s;e of their Separation be what it will, are almo&s;t always extremely zealous about their Peculiarities, and lay a prodigious Stre&s;s on them, and take unwearied Pains to make Pro&s;elytes. For the Strength and Credit of their Party chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in their Numbers. When they happen to be in the wrong, their Pride and Ambition, their Malice again&s;t &s;uch as oppo&s;e them, frequently prompt to take very

unlawful Mea&s;ures to encrea&s;e their Party, &s;uch as mi&s;repre&s;ent|ing their Adver&s;aries and blackening their Characters to render them odious to the World. Now &s;uch Conduct cannot but promote Hatred, Strife and Contention. While the carele&s;s World &s;ee profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians dividing from, and reproaching one another, and every Party confident they are right, and pleading Scripture to maintain their different Opinions and Practices; they are ready to &s;u&s;pect that the Scriptures them|&s;elves are uncertain, and that all Religion is Nothing but a Piece of Prie&s;tcraft. Thus the weak are &s;tumbled, and Thou|&s;ands prejudiced again&s;t Religion and hardened in their Sins to their eternal De&s;truction, by Divi&s;ions and Schi&s;ms. Now the&s;e &s;ad Con&s;equences lie at their Door who go off from the Church|es where they live, without ju&s;t Rea&s;on. For the Churches and Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t are exhorted to contend earne&s;tly for the Faith once delivered unto the Saints&mdash;Surely Nothing but real Nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould ever put any Man upon withdrawing from the Churches where he lives. If Men had a due Regard to Religion, and were not &s;trangely mi&s;taken; I can't but think, they would not withdraw from the &s;tanding Churches among us, unle&s;s they could &s;hew better Rea&s;ons than any of them have yet done.

tho&s;e whom you are bound to treat as Brethren as po&s;&s;ible, and rejoice and glory in di&s;obliging and mole&s;ting them!</P>
<P>As to Diotrephes's Call to the Mini&s;try, it was directly contrary to the expre&s;s Rules of the written Word, which forbid <Q>a Novice to be a Mini&s;ter, le&s;t being lifted up with Pride he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil.</Q> <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iii. 6.</NOTE> A Novice in this Text means a new Convert, as all, who are acquainted with the Greek in the Original, well know. Now he was according to his own Account but newly converted, and therefore was plainly excluded from the Mini&s;try by this Text for &s;ome Time. It is a pity your new Converts don't remember this Text. When they are &s;o very forward to be publick Speakers, they might do well if they would al&s;o &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the Words of James, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">James iii. 1.</NOTE> "My Brethren be not many Ma&s;ters or Teachers." Is that Forwardne&s;s, which leads Men to violate the expre&s;s Commands of God's holy Word, a good Mark of their Conver&s;ion?</P>
<P>Now it is to be feared, that &s;omething like Diotrephes's, is the Conver&s;ion which many among you have met with? It is indeed very probable that you will not be forward to avow, that this is the Religion you are acquainted with, becau&s;e it has been often expo&s;ed, and labours under &s;ome Di&s;grace &mdash; Men are not ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to believe they are mi&s;taken about Religion. Their natural Pride di&s;po&s;es them to hope well of them&s;elves When true and fal&s;e Religion are often de&s;cribed and clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed in Books, or in Preaching, there is hardly any Body that will lay Claim to the fal&s;e, as their own. In &s;uch Places Men's Experiences often become very orthodox, though their Practices are quite irregular. But I may leave others to judge how much Hone&s;ty there is in this.</P>
<P>If you had not embraced &s;ome Errors about experimental Religion, why do you &s;eparate from us? Why do you in|du&s;triou&s;ly b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zz it about, that we don't preach up Religion? And whence &s;hould this Notion have ari&s;en about your Mi|&s;takes in the&s;e Matters, and been believed by the mo&s;t &s;erious and religious Men in the Country? 'Twas very di&s;agreeable to many of the &s;tanding Mini&s;try to believe, you were &s;o awfully mi&s;taken. You were, many of you, not only Members in our Churches, but among our warme&s;t Adherents. What then could di&s;po&s;e any of us to entertain &s;uch Apprehen&s;ions

Yet with Re&s;pect to &s;ome of you, we would agreeable to the Scriptures make a Difference, hoping that they have only drunk in &s;ome unhappy Prejudices, and being Per&s;ons of no Learning, are only guilty of &s;ome Blun|ders in their Expre&s;&s;ions. But if this be the Ca&s;e with any of you, it is a Pity you &s;hould be &s;o tenacious of wrong Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, and di&s;reli&s;h the Form of &s;ound Words.</P>
<P>However the Matter in Debate, is not, whither any of you are true Saints? How far true Saints may be left to their own Weakne&s;s, and the Delu&s;ions of Satan, as David and Peter were, for a Sea&s;on, is beyond us to determine. It is Opinions and not Per&s;ons I oppo&s;e. If I have written again&s;t particu|lar Parties, it is becau&s;e they are well known to embrace the peculiar Tenets and Errors, again&s;t which I have levelled this Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>A Man's being gracious does not &s;ecure him always from Error and Delu&s;ion. Nor is Error the more to be regarded, and loved, were it ever &s;o certain, that tho&s;e who maintain it are truly pious Per&s;ons. But I heartily wi&s;h you would give &s;ome better. Evidences of your Piety, than running into de|&s;tructive Errors in Principle, and wild Extravagances in Prac|tice. It is not the mo&s;t probable Thing in the World, that God would permit you &s;o generally to embrace &s;uch fal&s;e No|tions of Religion, if you were &s;o eminently pious as you imagine. No Doubt the greater Part of erroneus Per&s;ons are full as corrupt in their Hearts as their Heads.</P>
<P>Where Per&s;ons are under any &s;erious Concern, and their Con&s;ciences in &s;ome Mea&s;ure tender, they would ordinarily be a great Deal &s;hocked, if Satan &s;hould tempt them to &s;uch gro&s;s Wickedne&s;s as he did John Lewis, and the Dutartres. He is more likely to &s;ucceed by putting on a religious Appearance, and counterfeiting as near as may be the Enlightenings of the Divine Spirit. This is to attack Per&s;ons in a Way they don't expect him. Now if he can by this plau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ible Di&s;gui&s;e bring them to give Heed to particular Sugge&s;tions from Scripture, it

will as effectually an&s;wer his Purpo&s;e, as if he per&s;uaded them, with the unhappy Per&s;ons abovementioned, to commit the mo&s;t horrid Crimes.</P>
<P>What was the Method Satan took to abu&s;e that Scripture, <Q>I have a few Things again&s;t thee, becau&s;e thou &s;uffere&s;t that Woman Jezebel&mdash;Behold I will ca&s;t her into a Bed&mdash; And I will kill her Children with Death,</Q> &amp;c. Was it not by a <HI>particular</HI> Direction and powerful Impre&s;&s;ion of it on the poor Wretch's Mind, as if it had <HI>immediately</HI> referred to him? Had he con&s;idered the true Scope, and the general Truths, which are contained in this Pa&s;&s;age; he might have clearly &s;een it had no more Reference to him than to others, and could not be any Warrant to him to kill his Wife and Children. But he was carried away with the Powerful Impre&s;&s;ion, and took it for granted, that it was an immediate Direction from God to him.</P>
<P>How was it that the <HI>Dutartres</HI> came to imagine that God had rai&s;ed up a Prophet to them from that Text, <Q>A Pro|phet &s;hall the Lord your God rai&s;e up unto you, of your Brethren, like unto me, him &s;hall ye hear in all Things what|&s;oever he &s;hall &s;ay unto you?</Q> Was it not by &s;ome powerful Impre&s;&s;ion of it on their Minds, as if it had an immediate Re|ference to them in particular?</P>
<P>Few or none of you I hope have been permitted to commit &s;uch horrid Crimes, in following your Impre&s;&s;ions. But there are Degrees in Sin. Some Sins are more &s;hockingly gro&s;s than others. Some that are very provoking in the Sight of God, as Unbelief for In&s;tance, are not reckoned &s;candalous among Mankind.

For as the Holy Spirit is the Author of the Scriptures, this Divine In|&s;tructor could never teach you for Scripture Things which are not at all contained in the&s;e &s;acred Writings.

<P>The next Pretence which you plead in Favour of your Im|pul&s;es, Revelations, and Perver&s;ions of Scripture is, that they are the &s;piritual Meaning which you are taught by the Spirit of God. You a&s;&s;ert this with great Confidence, and boldly pro|nounce tho&s;e to be blind and carnal, who don't under&s;tand the particular Pa&s;&s;ages ju&s;t as you are plea&s;ed to &s;piritualize them.</P>
<P>The Phra&s;e, Spiritual Sen&s;e of Scripture has been u&s;ually re|ferred, by &s;ober intelligent Chri&s;tians who have u&s;ed it, to that Di&s;covery of the peculiar Glory of divine Truths which God grants to his People by the &s;aving Illuminations of his Spirit, they beholding in the Gla&s;s of the Go&s;pel, the Glory of the Lord. And if you will u&s;e the Words <HI>&s;piritual Sen&s;e,</HI> to mean this and Nothing more, I &s;hould have no Debate with you, but would rather offer &s;undry Arguments to prove that none but true Saints ever behold the great Truths of the Go&s;pel in
<PB N="109" REF="009120_0064_1030F5F2B81EAF18">
their Spiritual Glory, &s;ince it is po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted by the Apo|&s;tle, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 14.</NOTE> that "the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God; for they are Fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him, neither can he know <HI>them,</HI> becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned. No Man, who is de&s;titute of the Spirit of God, can be &s;up|po&s;ed to know the peculiar Excellencies and Glories of the divine Truths which are contained in the Go&s;pel. Hence Chri&s;tians are directed to pray for the Teachings and Illumi|nations of the Holy Spirit, that the Eyes of their Under|&s;tanding may be enlightened.</P>
<P>But this is not what you mean by &s;piritual Sen&s;e of Scrip|ture. For then it would be no Support or Foundation for your new Truths, which you pretend are revealed to you from &s;uch and &s;uch Texts of Scripture. When the Minds of Sinners are enlightened by the Spirit of God, in the Scheme of Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as delivered in the Go&s;pel, they only &s;ee the Truths which are already revealed by the Spirit in the written Word. Divine Light may &s;hew Men what is in the Scriptures, e&s;pecially their eminent Excellency and Glory, but it does not di&s;cover new Truths and Duties, not contained in the Bible.

<P>Hence your &s;piritual Meaning or Sen&s;e of Scripture is a &s;e|cret my&s;tical Sen&s;e, which you imagine is communicated to you by immediate Revelation, and by which you know new Truths and Duties. The Scriptures according to you, have a literal and carnal Sen&s;e, and a my&s;tical and &s;piritual Sen&s;e, hidden and wrapped up under it, as in a Riddle or Allegory.

<P>Every Speaker, who u&s;es Words with Propriety has &s;ome De&s;ign in View, and of Con&s;equence &s;ome determinate Mean|ing fixed to his Words, whether he u&s;es plain Language or Metaphors, and Parable.

The Scriptures were penned by the In&s;pira|tion of the Holy Spirit, and treat chiefly about &s;piritual Things, and Men are brought to &s;ee their real Excellency and peculiar Glory by the Illuminations of the Spirit. How then can they have a carnal Meaning? Chri&s;t the great Antitype is come. Why would you turn the New-Te&s;tament into Types and Fi|gures? Is not this to throw Shadows and Darkne&s;s in&s;tead of Light upon the Go&s;pel? But this will appear plainer while I briefly point out &s;ome of the Marks and Characters of your &s;pi|ritual Meaning which you put on the Scriptures.</P>
<P N="1">1. Your &s;piritual Sen&s;e of Scripture has no Connexion with its true or real Sen&s;e. For In&s;tance, <Q>Je&s;us then cometh and taketh Bread and giveth them, and Fi&s;h likewi&s;e.</Q> Real Sen&s;e; <Q>Chri&s;t on a certain Occa&s;ion di&s;tributed Bread and Fi&s;h to his Di&s;ciples.</Q> Your &s;pirituall Sen&s;e, <Q>Bread and Fi&s;h mean Divine Light, Comfort and Joy.</Q> Je&s;us gives this &s;piritual Food, the&s;e divine Manife&s;tations, not to the World but to his true Di&s;ciples, his poor per&s;ecuted Followers, <HI>that is,</HI> your&s;elves. Now any unprejudiced Per&s;on may &s;ee this &s;piritu|al Meaning has no Connexion with, nor real Foundation in the Text.</P>
<P N="2">2. Your &s;piritual Meaning is &s;uch a Meaning as no &s;ober Man, let him have ever &s;o much Grace and Penetration, can &s;ee in the Text; and yet a blind, unconverted Sinner can under|&s;tand
<PB N="112" REF="009120_0066_1030F5F787B9D438">
it if he plea&s;es. Divine Influences and &s;aving Illumina|tion don't help a Man in the lea&s;t, to di&s;cern your &s;piritual Sen&s;e of Scripture. For many who are favoured with a large Share of &s;aving Light and Knowledge are quite Strangers to your &s;piritual Meanings. But &s;ome carnal Men are very well acquainted with them. <Q>Thus <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">1 Kings, i. 1&mdash;16.</NOTE> David's Servants &s;aid unto him, let there be &s;ought for my Lord the King a young Virgin, and let her &s;tand before the King, and let her cheri&s;h him; and let her lie in thy Bo&s;om, that my Lord the King may get Heat. So they &s;ought for a fair Dam&s;el&mdash;and found Abi|&s;hag,</Q> &amp;c. Your &s;piritual Sen&s;e of this Pa&s;&s;age is briefly, <Q>This fair Dam&s;el that cheri&s;hed King David was his Faith. This lay in his Bo&s;om and made him lively and warm in Re|ligion.</Q> A carnal Sinner can immediately under&s;tand this Meaning without any Illuminations of the Spirit.</P>
<P N="3">3 Your &s;piritual Sen&s;e not only has no Connexion with the real Sen&s;e, but is often quite contrary to it. Thus, <Q>Let your Women keep Silence in the Churches&mdash;and if they will learn any Thing, let them a&s;k their Hu&s;bands at Home." Spiritual Meaning; "Chri&s;t is their Hu&s;band, the Church is their Home. Therefore Women who are married to Chri&s;t by Faith may &s;peak in the Church.</Q> Here you &s;ee plainly, that the &s;piritual Sen&s;e is quite contrary to the true Sen&s;e. Thus again, <Q>Thou ha&s;t had five Hu&s;bands, and he, whom thou now ha&s;t, is not thy Hu&s;band.</Q> Spiri|tual Sen&s;e; <Q>Thou ha&s;t had five fal&s;e Hopes, and that Hope which thou now ha&s;t is not a true Hope,</Q> directly contrary to the real Meaning and De&s;ign of the Words.</P>
<P>In fine, by &s;uch Spiritualizings, any Thing and every Thing or Nothing, may be made out of any Scripture, as the Fancies of Men plea&s;e. There is no Rea&s;oning with &s;uch Men from Scripture.</P>
<P>Allow your &s;piritual Sen&s;e, and we can't e&s;tabli&s;h any Doc|trine, nor confute any Error by the mo&s;t expre&s;s Scripture For it is ea&s;y for you to &s;ay, we take the Scriptures in the li|teral, carnal Sen&s;e; but you have the &s;piritual Meaning of the Texts to Confirm you in your Opinion; or that you are not taught the &s;piritual Sen&s;e of the Texts brought to confute you. So that when Per&s;ons pretend to &s;et up &s;uch Spiritualizings of
<PB N="113" REF="009120_0066_1030F5F787B9D438">
Scripture, they in Fact &s;et the Bible a&s;ide. Now from whom do you think &s;uch Notions could &s;pring? Who is it that is mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly imployed in getting rid of the Bible?</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of the Fall of Man, the Miracles of Chri&s;t, &amp;c. have been &s;piritualized after this Manner, that is, explained away by &s;ome Writers. But no Parts of Scripture have been more &s;piritualized, than the Revelation and the Song of Solo|mon. The ingenious Mr. Lowman has commented very ex|cellently on the Revelation, re&s;cuing the &s;acred Text from many Spiritualizers, and explaining the real Import of the Language and the general De&s;ign of the Book.</P>
<P>Since the Song of Solomon was ranked among the Jewi&s;h Scriptures, according to In&s;piration, which would not per|mit any &s;purious Production to be placed in the &s;acred Canon; &s;ince Chri&s;t has declared, that the Scriptures cannot be broken; and Paul has expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted that all Scripture, <HI>that is,</HI> the whole Old-Te&s;tament is given by In&s;piration; it would be very ab&s;urd to que&s;tion its divine Authority. The following brief Account perhaps may be u&s;eful to point out the general De|&s;ign, and the right Method of explaining this celebrated Song.</P>
<P>Hu&s;bands and Wives mutually love one another. This mutual Love which is between Hu&s;band and Wife may be u&s;ed to repre&s;ent that Love which is between Chri&s;t and his true Followers. The Spirit of God has made U&s;e of Marriage to repre&s;ent it in &s;undry plain Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture. As Solo|mon was a Type of Chri&s;t, the Love which he and Pharaoh's Daughter had for each other, is pitched on as a particular In|&s;tance or Emblem, to repre&s;ent the Love that is between Chri&s;t and his People. This grand Truth is repre&s;ented in this cele|brated Song, which is written after the Manner of Pa&s;torals, by a great Variety of beautiful Images, in a very &s;triking Manner, agreeable to the Cu&s;toms, of the Jews, and the Ea&s;tern Ta&s;te. From the whole of this Song we learn this great Truth, <Q>that there is a mutual &s;trong Love between Chri&s;t and true Believers." This is celebrated here in a every lively Manner. There is no Need to wring the Expre&s;&s;ions to force out of them uncertain Niceties. <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Dr. Owen.</NOTE></Q></P>

<P>God &s;ometimes taught his People by Hieroglyphicks or Sym|bols. But it would be very wild to infer from this, that all the Scriptures are hieroglyphical. If God has revealed any where in his Word, that any particular Per&s;ons or Things were &s;ymbolical (as he has &s;ometimes done in the New-Te&s;ta|ment by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles) then we have a &s;ufficient Warrant to explain them, as Types or Hieroglyphicks. But where God has not told us that Per&s;ons or Hi&s;tories were Alle|gorical, how is it po&s;&s;ible for us to know it? Should not we &s;top where God has &s;topped? Mu&s;t not all beyond this be mere Imagination and Delu&s;ion?</P>
<P>Had Men been contented to have made Scripture the Inter|preter of Scripture, and not attempted to find out imagi|nary My&s;teries, which are no where revealed, many &s;trange Interpretations might have been happily prevented.</P>
<P>Common Readers, I &s;uppo&s;e, can &s;ee &s;o much in the plain Meaning of the Book of Job, as to be greatly benefited by the Example of Patience, which is &s;et before them in this eminent Per&s;on; and the Serious In&s;tructions and &s;ublime Sentiments, which are delivered in the various Di&s;cour&s;es, that pa&s;&s;ed be|tween him and his Friends, on Occa&s;ion of his Afflictions, &amp;c. But many &s;uppo&s;e this Book to be a dramatick Piece, a para|bolical Repre&s;entation. Who can tell how far they are right? On this Suppo&s;ition this Book mu&s;t have a hidden, my&s;tical, &s;piritual Meaning. Fancy mu&s;t be &s;et to Work to find it out. And as it is not revealed in Scripture, when or by whom the Book of Job was written, Imagination has a large Field to range in. Men may gue&s;s till they are tired: But how &s;hall they know when they have gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed right?</P>
<P>One may imagine it was written by Mo&s;es, that Job my&s;ti|cally repre&s;ents the Children of I&s;rael; his Afflictions and Mur|murings, their Bondage in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, Sufferings and Murmurings i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Wilderne&s;s; his Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r his heavy Afflictions,

their Pro&s;perity in the Land of Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aan. On this Scheme the Book of Job was de&s;igned to recommend Patience and Per&s;eve|rance to the I&s;raelites in the Wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>As Job is repre&s;ented to have lived in the Land of Uz, and the Names of &s;ome of his Friends are &s;uch as were common among the De&s;cendants of E&s;au. Another may imagine, this Book was written to comfort the Edomites, when they were carried away captive, and &s;ubjected to grievous Calamities. His Pro&s;perity may repre&s;ent their Re&s;toration; or their Con|ver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity. Another may imagine, the Book of Job was written by Ezra for the Support and Comfort of the Jews, after the Babyloni&s;h Captivity: That Job repre&s;ents the returning Jews, his three Friends, whom he called mi&s;erable Comforters, the fal&s;e Friends or Enemies of the Jews, Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bal|lat, Tobiah, and Ge&s;hem the Arrabian; his fooli&s;h Wife, the &s;trange Wives, whom the Jews had married, and whom they put away by divine Commandment, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Others may frame other Hypothe&s;es, as Things happen to jump in their Imaginations. Is it not a Pity they don't con|&s;ider, that, &s;ince the my&s;tical Meaning of this Book, if it has any, is not revealed in Scripture, they can never find it out? Is it not egregious Folly for Men to pretend to be wi&s;e above what is written? If &s;ome &s;elf-conceited contemptuous Writers were ever likely to read this Addre&s;s, or capable of taking Ad|vice from me, I would recommend it to them, when they are &s;eized with this Fondne&s;s for My&s;tici&s;m and Allegory, to con|fine them&s;elves to the Metamorpho&s;is of Ovid, Apulius, or the Dreams of Arremidorus They will &s;pend their Time more innocently in finding out the My&s;teries of the Heathens, than in torturing the Holy Scriptures, and they may appear quite as Learned.&mdash;To return,</P>
<P>If a Man &s;hould give you a Note or a Bond for a hundred Pounds, would you allow him, to take as much Liberty to &s;piritualize away the true intent of it, as you take with the Bible? If he &s;hould come and tell you with a great Deal of Heat and Zeal, that the &s;piritual Meaning of a hundred Pounds was not a hundred Pounds of Money, but a hundred Words, Comple|ments or Vi&s;its, or the like, would you not think be was mon|&s;trou&s;ly impudent, or di&s;tracted? And has not the Bible a real, important and fixed Meaning, as well as any other Writings?
<PB N="116" REF="009120_0068_1030F5FE009B9038">
How dare any Man take that Freedom with the Scriptures, which he would not allow his Neighbour in explaining a trifling Note or Bond, where his temporal Property was con|cerned?</P>
<P>Indeed there was a Nece&s;&s;ity on you, who &s;et up to be Ex|horters, to give into this Notion of Spiritualizing the Scrip|tures, from your great Ignorance of their true Meaning. I am very &s;erious, and remember while I am writing, I mu&s;t render a mo&s;t &s;trict and impartial Account of my Conduct at God's awful Bar. And under this &s;olemn Sen&s;e of the la&s;t Judgment on my Mind, I mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly declare, it is my firm Opinion, that &s;uch is the Ignorance which prevails among both your Teachers and People, who have &s;eparated from us, that all of you together could &s;carcely explain the true Sen&s;e of one &s;ingle Leaf of the Bible. So that your Teachers are obliged to &s;piritualize and pervert the Scriptures, or el&s;e for|bear holding forth.&mdash;It &s;eems al&s;o they find their Account in this &s;piritualizing, in drawing &s;undry after them; for &s;ome are wonderfully plea&s;ed to find &s;trange My&s;teries in plain Texts. Who could have thought, <HI>&s;ay they,</HI> &s;uch a wonderful Di&s;cour&s;e could have been made out of &s;uch a Text? Some will always be be&s;t plea&s;ed with new and &s;trange Things, which they don't under&s;tand!</P>
<P N="1">1. But I expect to be told that I deny all the Teachings of the Spirit, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, the Spirit of God teaches by giving us the Scriptures; and by impre&s;&s;ing the real Sen&s;e, the general Truths, that are contained in them on Men's Minds, as has been already explained. If therefore after this, any of you &s;hall dare to a&s;&s;ert, or in&s;inuate, that I deny the Operations of the Spirit, I mu&s;t look on it as a Specimen of wilful Malice and Deceit; &s;ince you can't but know, it is only your ab&s;urd &s;piritualizing of Scripture, which I di&s;card.</P>
<P N="2">2. But &s;ome Divines have &s;piritualized Scripture.</P>
<P>An&s;. You doubtle&s;s frequently mi&s;take the explaining Scrip|ture Metaphors for Spiritualizing, tho' they are widely diffe|rent. To &s;hew the true Meaning of &s;uch a metaphorical Phra&s;e, as draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation, pluck out a Right Eye, out off a right Hand: for In&s;tance, is not to &s;piritualize, but to explain.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="009120_0068_1030F5FE009B9038">Some of the&s;e Things, which you take for &s;piritualizing in the Writings of Divines, are only Allu&s;ions to Scripture Types, and Hi&s;tories, to give &s;ome Illu&s;tration to the Subject on which they are di&s;cour&s;ing, and to fix it a little more &s;trongly on the Memory. But what if Divines had &s;piritualized the Scripture in the Method, which I have endeavoured to expo&s;e? Does that make it right, when it is &s;o evidently wrong? I have long &s;ince learned, that I &s;hould call no Man Father or Ma|&s;ter upon Earth. Should we follow Men any further than they follow Chri&s;t and Truth?</P>
<P>Many of the be&s;t Divines have warmly remon&s;trated again&s;t this Spiritualizing Scripture from the Beginning of the Refor|mation. The excellent Dr. Doddridge ob&s;erves on 2 Cor. iii. 6. Not of the Letter, but of the Spirit] <Q>To under&s;tand this of an Allegorical (that is a Spiritual) rather than literal Explication of the Old Te&s;tament is very Arbitrary and Unwarrantable. And I wi&s;h no Chri&s;tian Commentators had given Encouragement to the Dei&s;ts, to abu&s;e this Text in the Manner it is well known they have done.</Q></P>
<P>Now when the Dei&s;ts thus &s;trongly arm them&s;elves from the Spiritualizings of Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and &s;ome weak Brethren, who have inadvertently embraced &s;ome of their Interpretations, is it not high Time to expo&s;e this Method of explaining the Bible? Should we for Fear of di&s;plea&s;ing &s;ome weak Per|&s;ons, quietly &s;it &s;till and be &s;ilent; until Enthu&s;ia&s;ts have ef|fectually prepared the Way for Dei&s;ts to di&s;card the Scriptures, or bring them into Contempt, as a Sy&s;tem of unintelligible mi&s;tical Jargon.</P>
<P>If I have quoted from the Writings of &s;ome Divines, this is to &s;hew that I am not &s;ingular, &s;ince many, who&s;e Prai&s;es are in the Churches of Chri&s;t, have been of the &s;ame Opinion.&mdash; But &s;ince it is one of the Artifices of unfair Opponents to Charge tho&s;e that write again&s;t them, with any exceptionable Expre&s;&s;ions or Notions they think they have found in the Books quoted from, or approved of in general; I here de|&s;ire it may be remarked, as I receive Nothing on any human Authority, I undertake to defend no Men's Peculiarities. I am willing to be tried by the Scriptures, and to &s;tand or fall by them. To them I appeal.</P>

"Baptize," of receiving Per&s;ons into the vi&s;ible Church by Water-Bapti&s;m, which, it &s;eems, was the known and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed Sen&s;e of the Word. For to baptize with the Holy Gho&s;t, and with Fire, is evidently a metaphorical Phra&s;e, which &s;ig|nified their &s;haring plentifully in the Influences of the Divine Spirit. Thus, el&s;e where, Chri&s;t u&s;es the Metaphor of Bapti&s;m to &s;ignify his dreadful Sufferings and Death. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 38. and x. 47, 48.</NOTE> <Q>Are ye able to be baptized with the Bapti&s;m I am to be baptized with?</Q> But to baptize with Water, as John the Bapti&s;t did, was the proper and common Sen&s;e of the Word. So the Apo&s;tles under&s;tood it, and &s;o they practi&s;ed. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Matt. xx. 22.</NOTE> Peter &s;aid to the three thou&s;and, <Q>Repent, and be baptized, every one of you in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, and ye &s;hall receive the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Their &s;haring in the Gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, or being baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t, did not &s;uper&s;ede the Nece&s;&s;ity of being baptized with Water. No, <Q>Can any Man forbid Water,</Q> <HI>&s;aid Peter</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Acts x. 47, 48.</NOTE> <HI>with Re&s;pect to Cornelius and other Gentile Converts,</HI> <Q>who have received the Holy Gho&s;t as well as we. And he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord.</Q> Though therefore Peter and Paul, as appears from &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages, did not ordinarily baptize them&s;elves, being chiefly employed in Preaching the Go&s;pel; yet they were careful in commanding that Bapti&s;m with Wa|ter &s;hould not be neglected. Philip who was under the imme|diate Direction of the Spirit, baptized the Eunuch with Water. Thus Bapti&s;m by Water was con&s;tantly practi&s;ed by the Apo&s;|tles. This is the <HI>one Bapti&s;m</HI> which they &s;peak of. And this Bapti&s;m was frequently accompanied with the Influences of the Holy Spirit. Some might lay too great a Stre&s;s upon Bap|ti&s;m in their Days, as the Papi&s;ts have done &s;ince, and others who teach that Men are regenerated by Bapti&s;m. To correct the Mi&s;take of &s;uch, Peter plainly tells them, that they were not to look &s;o much to their being baptized with Water, as to their living an&s;werable to their Promi&s;es in that holy Ordinance. <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">1 Pet.</NOTE> <Q>Bapti&s;m doth al&s;o now &s;ave us, not the putting away of the Filth of the Fle&s;h, but the An&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience towards God, by the Re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> Which

<P>Now who, that con&s;iders that Bapti&s;m by Water was of Divine In&s;titution, was never repealed, but was enjoined by Chri&s;t, and practi&s;ed by his Apo&s;tles, would think any Man would pretend to prove from their Writings, that it &s;hould be di&s;regarded?

<P>It is certain from the Scriptures that God held Adam's natu|ral Po&s;terity bound with him, in that Law or Covenant which he gave him in his State of Innocency. God cur&s;ed the Ground for the Sake of Adam's Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and his Po&s;terity in all their Generations have felt the &s;ad Effects of his Apo&s;tacy. It is likewi&s;e certain, that God bound Abraham's natural Po&s;teri|ty as well as him&s;elf, when he ratified his Covenant with him by Circumci&s;ion, which was, according to the Apo&s;tle Paul, a Seal of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith or Coveant of Grace. Now the Covenant of Grace was never yet repealed. Con&s;equently the Grant, which God made in it in Favour of the Infant Seed of his People, &s;till remains in full Force and Virtue. This is the plain Sen&s;e of the&s;e Scripture-Accounts.&mdash;'Tis true

For many excellent Chri&s;tians have had ungodly Children. The Sen&s;e then evidently is that the Children of Chri&s;tian Parents, or where only one of them profe&s;&s;es Chri&s;t, are vi&s;ibly holy by being in Covenant along with their Parents. Thus, according to the Apo&s;tle the Children of Chri&s;tian Parents are holy, and of Con|&s;equence proper Subjects of Bapti&s;m. Why &s;hould we refu&s;e to baptize Children and receive them into the vi&s;ible Church when God has thus expre&s;sly a&s;&s;ured us they are holy?</P>
<P><Q>Some brought little Children to Chri&s;t, that he &s;hould touch them, and his Di&s;ciples rebuked tho&s;e that brought them.

If little Children belong to the Kingdom of Glory, why &s;hould we refu&s;e to admit them into the vi&s;ible Church by Bapti&s;m? Would Men have their Churches in this World purer than Heaven it&s;elf? But if the Kingdom of God in this Text &s;hould be taken in the &s;econd Sen&s;e, as meaning the vi&s;ible Church or Kingdom which he has erected in the World, then, this Pa&s;&s;age is a direct Proof for Infant Bapti&s;m; &s;ince this is the Ordinance by which they were made vi&s;ible Members.

<P>But the Spiritual Sen&s;e which &s;ome of you put upon it is, <Q>The&s;e who were brought to Chri&s;t were not little Children in Age and Stature, but true Converts who re&s;embled lit|tle Children in their Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition.</Q> <HI>That is,</HI> Chri&s;t took up grown Per&s;ons in his Arms, who, it may be, were Thirty, Forty, Sixty, or Seventy Years old. &mdash;

<P N="2">2. But Chri&s;t &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples, Go and teach all Nations baptizing them in the Name of the Father, &amp;c.</P>
<P>An&s;. What then? According to your own Interpretation of this Text, it does not refer to Infants, but to grown adult Per|&s;ons. But how will you confute Infant Bapti&s;m from a Text which you grant has no Reference at all to it? Suppo&s;e I &s;hould allow for Argument's Sake, that Infant Bapti&s;m could not be proved from this Text; that would be no good Rea&s;on again&s;t it, &s;ince, as I have &s;hewed, it may be proved from other Scrip|tures. The Lord's Supper is not expre&s;sly mentioned in this Text. Will you admit this to be a good Proof, that Chri&s;ti|ans &s;hould not &s;hew forth the Lord's Death in this Ordinance according to his command in other Scriptures? All Things could not po&s;&s;ibly be taught in one Text. But how can any rea&s;onable, unprejudiced Man &s;uppo&s;e the Apo&s;tles under&s;tood this Commi&s;&s;ion. "Teach and baptize all Nations? Mu&s;t they not have under&s;tood it as comprehending Infants, when they knew they were received as Members of the Jewi&s;h Church at eight Days old, by Circumci&s;ion?

Had any In&s;inuations been made by the Apo&s;tles again&s;t Children; had they excluded them from the vi&s;ible Church; no Doubt their Enemies the Jews, would have made a loud Complaint again&s;t them for cutting off their Infant-Seed from the Lord.

<P>What has been already a&s;&s;erted, and clearly proved, again&s;t all immediate Impul&s;es and Revelations in our Day might &s;erve to confute your Pretences to an immediate Call to the Mini&s;try. For if Men's Duty be not ordinarily revealed to them by immediate Revelation, &amp;c. in any Ca&s;e, now, &s;ince the Scriptures were compleated; then certainly, it is not im|mediately revealed to Men, that they &s;hould preach the Go&s;pel. But &s;ince you greatly in&s;i&s;t upon this immediate Call to the Mini&s;try, and a great Part of the Religion which prevails among you, depending very much upon this Call, and &s;ince &s;ome others are ready to be &s;tumbled by their high Pretences; I &s;hall clear|ly &s;tate the true Notion of an immediate Call; &s;hew what Evidence is Nece&s;&s;ary to &s;atisfy us, that Per&s;ons have it, and thus prove that tho&s;e who pretend to it among the&s;e Sects are quite de&s;titute of this Evidence, and an&s;wer their principal Ob|jections, as they come in my Way.</P>
<P N="1">1. An immediate Divine Call to an Office is, God's reveal|ing to a Per&s;on that it is his Will to employ him in &s;uch an Office, or to perform &s;uch a Bu&s;ine&s;s, commanding him in an immediate Way to undertake it. Thus Mo&s;es was immediately called to bring the Children of I&s;rael out of Egypt. Thus ma|ny of the Prophets, as Samuel, Jeremiah, Jonah, Amos, for In&s;tance, were called. Thus the Apo&s;tles were called. Paul was a mo&s;t remarkable In&s;tance of this immediate Call.</P>
<P>Now in this Sen&s;e, you hold your Teachers are called. I &s;uppo&s;e Barclay &s;peaks the true Sen&s;e of you all, when he &s;ays, <Q>That none can be made Officers in the Church, but&mdash;by inward Revelations of the Spirit, (not by outward Ordina|tion)

from which none is to be excluded, if &s;o called, whi|ther married, or a Trade&s;man, or a Servant &mdash;And by the leading, moving, and drawing hereof, ought every <HI>Chri&s;tian Pa&s;tor</HI> to be led, and ordered in his Labour, and Work of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> both as to the Place <HI>where,</HI> as to the Per&s;ons to <HI>whom,</HI> and as to the Time <HI>wherein</HI> he is to mini&s;ter. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Anarch of Rout. p. 105. Apology p. 271.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>This immediate, Divine Call is not a Per&s;on's Mind being enlightened by the Spirit of God, in the true meaning of &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in Scripture; but is intirely a new Revelation. Let a Man's Mind be ever &s;o much inlightened in the <HI>true Sen&s;e</HI> of the whole Scriptures, he can never &s;ee, nor infer from them, that he is immediately called to be a Mini&s;ter to preach, in this par|ticular Place; to &s;uch a People; &s;uch a Time; becau&s;e there is no &s;uch Thing in the Bible, that he, &s;uch a one by Name, is called to this Station. True Light will indeed di&s;cover what is in Scripture, but does not help in the lea&s;t to &s;ee tho&s;e Things which are not in it at all. If therefore any Man be called to the Mini&s;try in an immediate Way, this Call mu&s;t be a quite new Revelation.</P>
<P>Examples &s;erve greatly to illu&s;trate Things. Let us then briefly con&s;ider the Example of the Apo&s;tle Paul. When Chri&s;t immediately called this violent Per&s;ecutor to preach the Go&s;|pel to the Gentiles, this was as much a new Revelation as any that ever was made. It could not be inferred from all that God had revealed to his Church before. An Impre&s;&s;ion on his Mind of &s;omething, that God had &s;aid to &s;ome of his ancient Prophets, as Elijah, I&s;aiah, Jeremiah, Amos, &amp;c. would not do in this Ca&s;e, be it ever &s;o clear and &s;trong; for this plain Rea&s;on, Per&s;ecuting Saul was not the &s;ame Man. He was not Elijah, nor I&s;aiah, nor Jeremiah, nor Amos, &amp;c. but Saul of Tar&s;us. Therefore the Call directed to them, could be no im|mediate Call to him.</P>
<P>Let us for once &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion had been made on his Mind, and he had looked on it as a Divine Call to the Mini&s;try, he mu&s;t al&s;o have looked on it, as immediately directed to him; and then as to the Sen&s;e of the Scripture-Words that were thus impre&s;&s;ed, this would have been intirely new, which would in Fact have rendered it to him, not an old, but wholly a new Revelation. The Scripture reveals that Je|hu, the Son of Jeho&s;haphat, was called to be King over I&s;rael;
<PB N="131" REF="009120_0075_1030F6121425F968">
and that Jeremiah of Anachoth was called to be a Prophet to the Jews. But how &s;hall any Man at this Di&s;tance rea&s;onably infer from hence that he is immediately called to be a King, or a Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ter? A new Revelation is as much needed to teach him this, as if the Scriptures had not revealed one Word about <HI>Jehu</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. I have clearly explained this the more largely, becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e, it will in &s;ome Mea&s;ure di&s;cover, what Sort of Evidence Men, who pretended to this immediate Call, mu&s;t produce to ju&s;tify their great Preten&s;ions. Every One, who is acquain|ted with his Bible, may remember that Miracles wrought in a publick open Manner are the Seal of God, by which he atte&s;ts the Truth of new Revelations. This was the Evidence which he bore to the Truth of the Old-Te&s;tament. This was the Seal by which he te&s;tified the Truth of the New in the Time of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles. Now if we carefully view the Temper of Mankind at pre&s;ent, it &s;hould &s;eem, there is as much Need of Miracles to prove the Truth of a Revelation, that &s;hould be made now, as there was in tho&s;e ancient Times. Is the World grown &s;o much better? Are not Men as natural|ly prone to Unbelief as ever? If they are, is there not Need of the &s;ame Sort of Evidence to prove the Truth of New Re|velations, which was formerly granted to recommend them?</P>
<P>The Lord &s;eems to have given us ju&s;t Grounds to expect Miracles, from tho&s;e who profe&s;s to come with a new Revelati|on and an immediate Call, by his Conduct towards Mo&s;es, when he gave him that immediate Commi&s;&s;ion to bring the Children of I&s;rael out of Egypt. Mo&s;es him&s;elf had &s;ufficient Evidence that God called him. But he was a Man of too good Sen&s;e, and too well acquainted with Mankind, to think, that his telling others what he had &s;een and felt, would be rea&s;ona|ble Evidence to them, that the Lord had given him that im|portant Commi&s;&s;ion. Therefore he humbly de&s;ired to be in|formed how he &s;hould &s;urmount this Difficulty; and the Lord a&s;&s;ured him he would grant him the inconte&s;table Evidence of Miracles, to prove his immediate Divine Call. This remar|kable Pa&s;&s;age is &s;o very pertinent to my Purpo&s;e, that it would be Inju&s;tice to my Argument not to tran&s;cribe it intire.</P>

me nor hearken unto my Voice, for they will &s;ay, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee. And the Lord &s;aid un|to him, What is that in thine Hand? And he &s;aid, A Rod. And he &s;aid, Ca&s;t it on the Ground; and he ca&s;t it on the Ground, and it became a Serpent, and Mo&s;es Fled from before it. And the Lord &s;aid unto Mo&s;es, Put forth thine Hand, and take it by the Tail. And he put forth his Hand and caught it, and it became a Rod in his Hand. That they may believe that, the Lord God of their Fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of I&s;aac, and the God of Jacob hath ap|peared unto thee. And the Lord &s;aid furthermore unto him, Put now thine Hand into thy Bo&s;om: And he put his Hand into his Bo&s;om, and when he took it out, behold his Hand was leprous as Snow. And he &s;aid, Put thy Hand into thy Bo&s;om; and he put his Hand into his Bo&s;om again, and plucked it out of his Bo&s;om, and behold it was turned again as his <HI>other</HI> Fle&s;h. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s if they will not believe thee, nor hearken to the Voice of the fir&s;t Sign, that they will believe the Voice of the latter Sign.

<P>Thus the Lord, having &s;ent Mo&s;es with an immediate Com|mi&s;&s;ion to the Children of I&s;rael, gave him &s;uch Credentials, as were &s;ufficient to prove in the cleare&s;t Manner to all concerned that he had called him. It &s;eems they would have been guilty of unrea&s;onable Ha&s;tine&s;s and Inadvertency; if they had re|ceived Mo&s;es on his own bare Affirmation. The Lord, who called him, a&s;&s;ured him, he would &s;upport him in di&s;charging his Commi&s;&s;ion. Now is it not &s;till &s;uitable to the Perfections of God, and does not the Nature of Things require, that he &s;hould, in &s;ome &s;uch convincing Manner, maintain the Au|thority of all tho&s;e whom he calls immediately to any Of|fice?</P>
<P>But lea&s;t you &s;hould imagine, I &s;train Matters in my rea|&s;oning on this In&s;tance of the Old-Te&s;tament, I &s;hall now turn to the New. Permit me to a&s;&s;ure you it will give me great Satisfaction, if you'l look with your own Eyes, and laying, a&s;ide

<P>Does not our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord plainly teach us, we have a Right to in&s;i&s;t on &s;ome other Evidence of a Man's immediate Call than his own SAY SO, in the following Pa&s;&s;ages. <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">John v 31, 32 &amp;c.</NOTE> <Q>If I bear Witne&s;s of my&s;elf, my Witne&s;s is not true.</Q> <HI>That is,</HI> If I produce no other Witne&s;s or Proof of my divine Mi&s;&s;ion, but my own Affirmation, this is not to be admitted as true. It would not be &s;ufficient Evidence for you to act upon. You could not be blamed for rejecting me, if I gave you no other Te&s;timony than this. Hence, Chri&s;t appealed to the Te&s;ti|mony of John the Bapti&s;t, who was known to be an eminent Prophet; and to the glorious Miracles which he him&s;elf per|formed. <Q>The Works which the Father hath given me to fini&s;h, the &s;ame Works that I do, bear Witne&s;s of me, that the Father hath &s;ent me.</Q></P>
<P>Agreeable to this, is that celebrated Pa&s;&s;age of his &s;olemn Di&s;cour&s;e, which he had with his Di&s;ciples immediately before he was betrayed. <Q>If I had not come and &s;poken unto them they had not had Sin; but now they have no Cloak for their Sin. <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">John xv. 22, 24.</NOTE> If I had not done among them the Works which none other Man did, they had not had Sin; but now they have both &s;een, and hated, both me and my Father.</Q> If Chri&s;t had not given &s;ufficient Evidence, and wrought Mira|cles to prove his divine Mi&s;&s;ion; it would have been no Sin to have rejected him. Since therefore Chri&s;t has declared, it was nece&s;&s;ary for him, who was the &s;upreme Lord of all, to give &s;uch Evidences; &s;ince he did not think fit to require any to acknowledge and receive him, 'till he had fully proved that God had &s;ent him; this plainly teaches us we have a Right to demand due Evidence from tho&s;e who pretend to come in his Name, before we &s;ubmit to their Mini&s;trations. Such who pretend to an immediate Call, and require us to receive them, without bringing any Evidence but their own Affirmation, pretend to higher Authority, than Chri&s;t him&s;elf ever did. But Chri&s;t has declared it was unrea&s;onable for the Servant to expect to be above his Lord.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="134" REF="009120_0077_1030F6188B29DD48">1. Some who pretend to an immediate Divine Call to the Mini&s;try, without having any &s;ufficient Evidence to prove it; I am &s;en&s;ible will object here, that only true Chri&s;tians are ca|pable of judging of this Evidence. But this is only a trifling Sophi&s;m, by which they deceive them&s;elves, and impo&s;e on &s;ome well meaning Per&s;ons; but does not at all remove the A&s;urdity.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t are &s;ent to preach the Go&s;pel to all Nations, to every Creature, <HI>that is,</HI> to every Man without Exception; and con&s;equently, to unconverted Sinners, as well as to Saints. This may be further proved from Sinner's being blamed, &s;harply reproved, yea threatened with &s;evere Puni&s;hments, for rejecting the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t. This plainly &s;uppo&s;es that God has given Mankind &s;ome Evidence, by examining which they may know who are the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, &s;ince it would be apparently unju&s;t to puni&s;h Men for di&s;regarding them, if they can't po&s;&s;ibly know them? There|fore it mu&s;t be allowed, that Mankind, notwith&s;tanding that moral Depravity which they derive from our fir&s;t Parents, can examine and judge whether Mini&s;ters have a divine Call.</P>
<P>This is very plain from that pointed Addre&s;s of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour to the Jews, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Luke xii. 54 &mdash;57.</NOTE> <Q>When ye &s;ee a Clould ri&s;e out of the We&s;t, &s;traitway ye &s;ay, there cometh a Shower, and &s;o it is. And when ye &s;ee the South Wind blow, ye &s;ay, there will be Heat, and it cometh to pa&s;s. Ye Hypocrites, ye can di|&s;cern the Face of the Sky; but how is it, that ye, do not di&s;cern this Time? Yea, and why even of your&s;elves judge ye not what is right?</Q></P>
<P>Nothing can be plainer than that our Lord takes it for granted in the&s;e Words, that the unbelieving Jews, though they were as deeply involved in original Sin as others; and more ob&s;tinate and hardened in their own Sins than mo&s;t, were notwith&s;tanding endowed with &s;uch Faculties as render|ed them capable of judging of the Evidences of his divine Mi&s;&s;ion, which he exhibited before them; as al&s;o that the Evidences which he produced to &s;upport his Preten&s;ions to an immediate Call from God were &s;uch, as would actually have convinced any rational Per&s;on, whether Saint or Sinner, who &s;hould candidly examine them.

Whence does &s;uch a Wrongne&s;s of Temper ari&s;e? He has granted the Fact to be &s;o, and he is as much obliged to account for the Phaenomenon as the Calvini&s;ts.</P>
<P>Though Men in their natural State can judge in &s;ome Mea&s;ure of Truth and Fal&s;hood, Right and Wrong, and by examining the Evidences with which the Scriptures are recommended mu&s;t be convinced they are true, yet they are repre&s;ented in the&s;e &s;acred Writings to be in a State of Ignorance, Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ne&s;s and Blindne&s;s, while they remain unregenerate, when compared with &s;in|cere Saints, who enjoy the &s;aving Illuminations, and &s;anctifying Influences of the Holy Spirit. <Q>The Path of the ju&s;t is as the &s;hining Light, that &s;hineth more and more unto the perfect Day. The Way of the Wicked is as <HI>Dark|ne&s;s,</HI> they know not at what they &s;tumble. The Fool walketh in <HI>Darkne&s;s.</HI> I am the Light of the World, <HI>&s;aid our Lord to the Jews.</HI> He that followeth me &s;hall not walk in <HI>Darkne&s;s,</HI> but &s;hall have the Light of Life. <HI>Chri&s;t plainly told the unbelieving Jews,</HI> That though they acknowledged his Fa|ther to be their God, yet they had not known him.</Q> And though they were endowed with &s;uch Faculties as rendered them quite inexcu&s;ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in not judging what was right, yet the Apo&s;tle repre&s;ents them as having their Minds &s;o blind, and &s;uch a Vail on their Hearts, as could be removed only by the Spirit of the Lord. According to the Apo&s;tle John. <Q>He that hateth his Brother is in DARKNESS, and walketh in Darkne&s;s, and knoweth not whither he goeth, becau&s;e that DARKNESS <HI>hath blinded his Eyes.</HI></Q> The Gentiles being more wicked and debaugched, are frequently &s;poken of as being more in Darkne&s;s than the Jews. And thus all Mankind both Jews and Gentiles, while they remain unregenerate and in Unbelief are repre&s;ented in the Scrip|tures, as ignorant and blind, notwith&s;tanding their being endowed with Ca|pacities to judge of Truth and Fal&s;hood, Right and Wrong. But how came Mankind to be thus ignorant and blind? It they are thus blind with Re&s;|pect to a living and &s;aving Sen&s;e and Knowledge of divine Things, does not this plainly prove, they have Need of the Illuminations of the Holy Spirit?</P>
<P>But it is currently reported that the Doctor is become more orthodox in the&s;e Points. &mdash; In his Sermons on &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait Gate, he &s;eems to allow <Q>That Mankind are not to be con&s;idered in a State of Innocency at pre&s;ent, but apo&s;tate, degenerate and guilty Creatures, ju&s;tly obnoxious to the Wrath of God&mdash;That the very Foundation of the Go&s;pel is laid in, and the whole &s;uper&s;tructure of it built upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that Mankind in general are in &s;uch a State of Condemnation and Ruin.</Q> P. 11. And he &s;eem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> likewi&s;e to grant <Q>The Nece&s;&s;ity of the Illuminations of the Holy Spirit&mdash;for a new Heart, and right Spirit.&mdash;And lays it is generally if not univer&s;ally agreed among&s;t profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, that Repentance unto Life, and evangelical Holine&s;s are not attainable without the gracious Operations of the Holy Spirit; and con&s;equently that without the&s;e divine Influences all the Endeavours of Sinners to attain Holine&s;s and &s;o to eter|nal Life mu&s;t be ineffectual. Which indeed amounts to neither more nor le&s;s than what our Lord him&s;elf declares&mdash;That except a Man be born again he cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God.</Q> &amp;c. Had he di&s;covered this &s;ooner might not &s;ome of his Banter have been &s;pared? But it is agreeable to &s;ee how he grows wi&s;er as he grows older.</P>
<P>The Opinion which he endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h in the&s;e two la&s;t Sermons, perhaps in Brief is this, <Q>That though Mankind are now in a degenerate State, yet God for the Sake of Chri&s;t has granted the Influences of his Spirit equal|ly to all who live under the Go&s;pel; and that they having rational Facul|ties may &s;o &s;trive for Grace and Salvation as actually to obtain the &s;peci|al Favour of God, in Con&s;equence of their &s;uitable Improvement of the&s;e general Influences, and their earne&s;t Strivings, God having e&s;tabli&s;hed a Connexion between this Be&s;towment of his &s;pecial Grace and &s;uch &s;incere Endeavours of unregenerate Sinners as the Doctor has di&s;cribed: And that unregenerate Sinners having the&s;e general Aids, Awakenings of the Spirit, &amp;c. not only may, but many of them actually do thus &s;trive; &s;o that &s;uch as are actually converted and &s;aved, do in Fact become Partakers of this Grace and Salvation, in Con&s;equence of their having previou&s;ly &s;trove and improved the religious Advantages, which God be&s;towed upon them in common with tho&s;e who live under the Go&s;pel, better than others; and that all, who do not thus fir&s;t &s;trive for Salvation, and make this better Improvement of their common Advantages, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall of Rege|neration here and the Kingdom of Heaven hereafter</Q></P>
<P>As God has commanded Sinners as well as Saints to &s;eek his Grace and Mercy, and to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon him for all they need, there can be no rea&s;ona|ble Doubt but it is their Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and a Duty of great Importance to &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate.

<P>Was not Nicodemus a Stranger to Regeneration when he came to Je&s;us by Night? yet even then he could &s;ay <Q>Rabbi, we know that thou art a Teacher come from God; for no Man can do the&s;e Miracles that thou doe&s;t, except God be with him.</Q> Thus Chri&s;t gave Evidence that was &s;ufficient in it|&s;elf to convince Sinners as well as Saints, if they had candidly attended to it. Chri&s;t bore this Evidence not only to him&s;elf but al&s;o to his Apo&s;tles, yea to all whom he ever called in an immediate Manner to preach his Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that only true Chri&s;tians can judge of the immediate Call of Mini&s;ters is to open the Doors to all Sorts of Impo&s;tors who honoring their Followers with this high Character will avail them&s;elves of this Pretence. When they are oppo&s;ed, they can ea&s;ily &s;ay their Oppo&s;ers are blind and unconverted and &s;o can't judge of their Preten&s;ions, whereas true Chri&s;tians know and acknowledge their Call. Now by true Chri&s;tians they mean their own Followers and fond Admirers. Thus they wre&s;t them&s;elves out of the Hands of indifferent, impartial Judges, and appeal to tho&s;e they know are &s;trongly prejudiced in their Favour. It would be &s;trange indeed, if their own Admirers &s;hould not &s;trongly witne&s;s for them. This is a fine Way to be tried, when they them&s;elves are both Judge and Party. How can a Deceiver be detected on this Plan, which takes his bold Say &s;o for Proof? And allows him to bear Witne&s;s of him&s;elf, that God has immediately called him, in direct Oppo&s;ition both to Scripture and Rea&s;on?</P>
<P>In fine, God has been plea&s;ed to give &s;undry plain Intima|tions in his Word, that he would rai&s;e up and qualify Men for the Mini&s;try; and call them to it; not in an extraordinary Manner as he did the Apo&s;tles, but in a common, ordinary Way. Hence the Apo&s;tle Paul gave various Directions to Timothy and Titus, and con&s;equently to the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t in all Ages how to proceed in putting Men into the Mini&s;try. The&s;e Directions plainly prove, that God determined to call Mini&s;ters to &s;upply his Churches in the common, ordinary Way. For there would be no Room to follow them, to examine and
<PB N="140" REF="009120_0080_1030F620DF247538">
judge, approve or reject Candidates for the Mini&s;try, if God called them to it in an immediate Manner. They who come into the Mini&s;try according to the&s;e Directions have the Call of God agreeable to the &s;tated Rules of the Word.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince God has appointed a Method for the &s;upply of his Churches, we may argue from his Wi&s;dom, that he will not recede from it unle&s;s on &s;ome very extraordinary Occa&s;ion. When he does, he will undoubtedly give &s;ufficient Evidence, that he has altered the old and &s;et up a new Plan. As there|fore, &s;uch Alterations have always been introduced by Miracles, we act &s;afely in adhering to the &s;tated Rules delivered in the New-Te&s;tament, in calling Men to the Mini&s;try, till tho&s;e, who reject them, and plead for an immediate Call, work Miracles to prove that God has repealed the&s;e Rules; and that their Preten|&s;ions for an immediate Call, are not mere Fancies or immediate Delu&s;ions.</P>
<P N="2">2. Barclay <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See his Apology; P. 296.</NOTE> objects again&s;t this Argument, that John the Bapti&s;t wrought no Miracles. To which it may be ea&s;ily an&s;wered, that the Call of this eminent Per&s;on, before he was born, was confirmed by very public and &s;triking Miracles, as is evident from the fir&s;t Chapter of Luke's Go&s;pel. Be&s;ides as John the Bapti&s;t was the Son of Zacherias, who was a Prie&s;t; he had a common and ordinary Call to be a Teacher to the People, according to the &s;tated Cu&s;toms of that Di&s;pen&s;ation. So that John the Bapti&s;t had both a common and extraordinary Call, which la&s;t was confirmed by Miracles. As this Writer has pitched on no other particular In&s;tance of any Per&s;on, who was immediately called, and no Miracles wrought to prove his Call was from God; it &s;hould &s;eem he was exceedingly pinched by this Argument. 'Tis greatly probable his not knowing how to an&s;wer it was the true Rea&s;on, he &s;tudied &s;o much Brevity here, when he is &s;o very lengthy almo&s;t every where el&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. Some pretend to evade the Force of the foregoing Rea|&s;oning again&s;t their immediate divine Call, by alledging, that Sinners are convinced, and converted, and Saints edified by their Mini&s;try, which is a great Miracle, and therefore accor|ding to my Principles a &s;ufficient Proof of their immediate Call.</P>

<P>To appeal to the Conver&s;ion of Sinners, and the Edification of Saints, as a Miracle to prove your immediate Call, is in Re|ality to appeal to your own Party, whether you are in the right; &s;ince tho&s;e Sinners, that are imagined to be converted, and the Saints &s;uppo&s;ed to be edified, are all your own Followers. It would be &s;trange indeed if they would not bear Witne&s;s for their Ring Leaders.

Whereas, when God &s;ends any Mini&s;ter, he &s;ends him to all Sorts, to Sinners as well as Saints, to the lukewarm and &s;ecure, the carele&s;s and prophane; and con&s;equently the Evidence of his Divine Call is &s;uch, as they, even they, can judge upon, at lea&s;t in &s;ome Mea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="4">4.

<P>An&s;. It is certain that Paul wrought Miracles among the Corinthians, and that he appeals to the Miracles he wrought among them, as the great Proof that God had called him to be an Apo&s;tle. This is inconte&s;tably evident from his own Words. <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xii. 11, 12.</NOTE> <Q>I ought to have been commended of you, for in Nothing am I behind the very chiefe&s;t Apo&s;tles.

<P>If you would clo&s;ely examine the Pa&s;&s;age, you might &s;ee that he fir&s;t appeals to his miraculous Call to prove he was an Apo&s;tle. <Q>Am I not an Apo&s;tle? &mdash;Have I not &s;een Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord?</Q> Thus he appeals to that gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rious Vi&s;ion, which he had of Chri&s;t, when he was going to Dama&s;cus, which &s;truck him blind, and all who were with him &s;peechle&s;s; at which Time he was immediately called by a loud Voice from Hea|ven, as the grand Proof of his Apo&s;tle&s;hip. This is one of the mo&s;t &s;triking and inconte&s;table Miracles that ever was wrought. To this therefore he appeals in the fir&s;t Place. <HI>Have I not &s;een the Lord?</HI> And you &s;ee from the above quoted Pa&s;&s;age, 2 Cor. xii. 11, 12. that he appeals to the Signs, Wonders, and mighty Deeds, the glorious Miracles he had wrought before their own Eyes, as the grand Proof of his being an Apo&s;tle. So that their Conver&s;ion could only be a &s;econdary Proof of his Call to be an Apo&s;tle. It &s;hould have been tran&s;lated, <Q>For <HI>a</HI> Seal of mine Apo&s;tle&s;hip are ye in the Lord,</Q> not <HI>the</HI> Seal, as all who are acquainted with the Original, know it would properly bear.</P>
<P>Paul was immediately called to be an Apo&s;tle, before he had ever preached the Go&s;pel at all.

The Succe&s;s of his Mini&s;try was not the Proof of his immediate Call, but it was a Proof and Evidence, that the Lord owned him in this Office. All there|fore, that can be inferred from this Text is, that the Succe&s;s of a Mini&s;ter, who has fir&s;t given &s;ufficient Proof, that God has immediately called him, is an Evidence that God ble&s;&s;es the Truths which he delivers. This in Conjunction with other valid Proofs may corroborate the Evidence, and be a Seal to his Mini&s;try; but is by no Means to be looked on as a &s;ufficient Evidence of it&s;elf.

your Cau&s;e might be improved again&s;t you. For the &s;tanding Mini&s;ters are regularly called, and &s;et apart according to divine Appointment, to the Work of the Mini&s;try, and therefore have the ordinary Call of God agreeable to the &s;tated Rules of his Word. God has been plea&s;ed to own them in their Of|fice, making them In&s;truments of converting Sinners, and edi|fying Saints. You mu&s;t acknowledge this, &s;ince many of you have declared that you were converted in the &s;tanding Church|es before you &s;eparated.</P>
<P>Upon your own Principles then, we can &s;ay to &s;undry of you, <HI>Are not you our Work in the Lord? If we be not Apo&s;tles to others, yet doubtle&s;s we are to you: For a Seal of our Mini&s;try are ye in the Lord.</HI> And to this Day, ble&s;&s;ed be God, there are &s;ome hope|ful In&s;tances of Conver&s;ion among us, in which we are impro|ved as the In&s;truments. So that Chri&s;t has not for&s;aken us. He ble&s;&s;e&s;s the Word preached in the &s;tanding Churches both to Saints and Sinners, notwith&s;tanding all the Pains you have taken to prejudice Men's Minds again&s;t our Per&s;ons and Mi|ni&s;try. Now if the Mini&s;ters in the &s;tanding Churches were, as you confe&s;s, once true Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and owned by him as &s;uch, are we not &s;o &s;till? E&s;pecially &s;ince we &s;till maintain the &s;ame Religion both in Principle and Practice as formerly? Since it is certain from Chri&s;t's Promi&s;e, and the &s;en&s;ible Effects of his Pre&s;ence and Spirit in &s;undry In&s;tances, that he has not for&s;aken the &s;tanding Churches how dare you? Speak out plain i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you think that Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters have fallen from Grace. But if you pretend to an immediate Call, then work Miracles to prove that your Call is from God, and not from the Devil. You are obliged to work Miracles to &s;upport your extraordinary Preten&s;ions or el&s;e give them up. Con&s;ider this at your Lei&s;ure, and remember that a thou&s;and A&s;&s;ertions, con|ceived in the &s;tronge&s;t Terms and expre&s;&s;ed with the greate&s;t Zeal don't amount to one good Proof. You may depend up|on it that &s;olid Proof and not confident A&s;&s;ertions will be expec|ted. If God has really given your Teachers an immediate Call he will doubtle&s;s work Miracles to prove it, &s;ince their Credit with all judicious People nece&s;&s;arily requires this incon|te&s;tible Evidence, and God is &s;till the &s;ame, and therefore as able to give this Evidence now as in former Ages.</P>

this Honour, but he that is called of God as was Aaron.</Q> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Heb. v. 1&mdash;4.</NOTE></P>
<P>An&s;. This I &s;uppo&s;e is one of the many Scriptures which you quote for the Sake of the Sound, &s;ince in its true Sen&s;e it is evidently Nothing to your Purpo&s;e, as will pre&s;ently appear.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle is here di&s;cour&s;ing of the High-Prie&s;thood among the Jews, which Office he &s;ays, as they knew from the Law of Mo&s;es, no Man had a Right to but he that was called of God, as Aaron and his Po&s;terity were. Now what can this Pa&s;&s;age which has no Reference at all to the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try prove about it? But if I &s;hould, for Argument's Sake, grant that this Text referred to the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try, what would you infer from it? That Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters &s;hould be called under the New-Te&s;tament as the high Prie&s;ts were under the Old? Then it would follow that Mini&s;ters &s;hould not be im|mediately called them&s;elves, but by &s;ome other. For Aaron was called by Mo&s;es according as the Lord commanded him. Then al&s;o none &s;hould pre&s;ume to officiate as Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, but Mini&s;ter's Sons. For none might be High-Prie&s;ts under the Law, but the Sons and lineal De&s;cendants of Aaron.</P>
<P>Once more, when God called any Per&s;ons in an immediate Way, he gave them Qualifications with his Call, &s;o that they were well fitted for the Mini&s;try. Thus the Prophets of Old. Thus al&s;o St. Paul and the Apo&s;tles. Hence, it may be pre|&s;umed, that if you were really called of God, you would be eminently fitted to preach the Go&s;pel. But this is not the Ca&s;e with you.</P>
<P>Here I dare appeal to &s;undry who have occa&s;ionally attended your Meetings. Let me a&s;k &s;uch, are not the Di&s;cour&s;es of the&s;e Exhorters very mean and de&s;picable; without Sen&s;e as well as Connexion? Is not the Vehemency of the Speakers almo&s;t the only Thing that recommends their Exhortations? How unlike are their Exhortations to the &s;olid, weighty Di&s;cour&s;es of the Prophets and Apo&s;tles, though they pretend to the &s;ame im|mediate Divine Commi&s;&s;ion, and the &s;ame extraordinary A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance? What plainer Proof can there be of the Vanity of their Preten&s;ions?&mdash;I wi&s;h &s;ome ready Writer would take down one of their Exhortations or Preachments as they de|liver it, and publi&s;h it to the World, that their Admirers might &s;ee what it is they are carried away with, and that

they them&s;elves might learn a little more Mode&s;ty, and for|bear meddling with Matters that are too high for them.&mdash; The Go&s;pel is not mere vehement Noi&s;e and Bawling.</P>
<P>It is in vain for the&s;e Teachers to plead the Example of the Apo&s;tles, for their own Ignorance and Want of Learning. The Apo&s;tles were &s;ome con&s;iderable Time under the In&s;truc|tions of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. They under&s;tood the Go&s;pel to great exactne&s;s, and had a thorough Acquaintance with the Scrip|tures. They &s;poke with Propriety on every Subject they had Occa&s;ion to handle. Whether their Abilities were natural, acquired, or communicated in an extraordinary Manner; certain it is, they wrote with &s;o much Correctne&s;s and good Sen&s;e, as but few learned Men can equal.</P>
<P>Our Tran&s;lation calling them <HI>ignorant Men.</HI> Acts iv. 13. is very unhappy, &s;ince the original Words lit-rally &s;ignify only this, that they were <HI>not S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctors,</HI> nor in any <HI>publick Rank of Life,</HI> as the Prie&s;ts and Magi&s;trates were: But they import no Want of natural good Sen&s;e, or any Ignorance of what was then the Subject of Debate. Though they did not &s;eek after rhetorical Embelli&s;hments, &s;towery or fertile Ornaments; yet they delivered them&s;elves with Sublimity of Thought, and a &s;triking Simplicity of Style, which is the true&s;t Eloquence.</P>
<P>What &s;hall I &s;ay of your Women, who are &s;o forward to &s;peak, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r Witne&s;s, exhort and hold forth, in your publick A&s;&s;emblies? I would be far from &s;aying of Women in general as the Celebrated Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> does.</P>
<Q>"Every Woman would be a Queen for Life."</Q>
<P>For I have the Happine&s;s to be acquainted with &s;undry virtuous Women, who look upon Humility and Mode&s;ty as mo&s;t excellent Ornaments, and who di&s;cover by their amiable Conduct, they feel their meek and gentle Influence. But I may &s;ay without giving any Offence to &s;uch mode&s;t and vir|tuous Ladies.</P>
<Q>"The Female Preachers would be Queens for Life."</Q>
<P>Since it is well know, that, even tho&s;e Women who are mo&s;t devoted to reading, rarely get a better Acquaintance with Books or Things, than an under&s;tanding Grammar School-Boy; what &s;hould tempt tho&s;e, who perhaps are very I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry Readers, and wor&s;e Spellers, to lay a&s;ide that Mode&s;ty which

But however fond your Women may be of their u&s;urped Authority, I pre&s;ume it may be di&s;puted, and the Foundation, upon which it is built, ex|amined.</P>
<P>And now Ladies, to addre&s;s you with Complai&s;ance; you would probably plead, that by long Acquintance with your Hu&s;bands, you di&s;covered their Weakne&s;s, and your own Su|periority; and thus found your&s;elves well qualified to in&s;truct and govern them, and therefore you a&s;&s;ume no more than is due to your &s;uperior Merit.</P>
<P>An&s;. If this be really true I pity your Families. But it is not fair you &s;hould be Judges in your own Ca&s;e. There may be Rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;pect you were bya&s;&s;ed in your own Favour, when you made your Di&s;coveries. It is but rea&s;onable to &s;ubmit this Matter to impartial Judges.&mdash;But not to debate this Point much with you; If what you alledge were really &s;o, it would not follow, that you are qualified to in&s;truct and govern Men, in general; &s;ince it is very likely, there are many Men much wi&s;er than your Hu&s;bands. Now when you &s;peak and teach in publick, you thereby u&s;urp or u&s;e Autho|rity over all the Men, that happen to hear you. If there happen to be any Man hearing you, wi&s;er than you are, which would be no wonderful Thing neither, then be&s;ure you are out of your Sphere, and are acting contrary to the Fit|ne&s;&s;es of Things, as Philo&s;ophers &s;peak, as well as to Scrip|ture. It is no Doubt a Sight to behold a Number of Men &s;itting very <HI>gravery</HI> in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Subjection</HI> to a Woman, and attend|ing with all Obedience to her Dictates! 'Tis difficult to &s;ay whether <HI>their</HI> abject Submi&s;&s;ion, or <HI>her</HI> imperious Impudence is mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing.</P>
<P>Perhaps you would further plead, that the Flippancy of your Tongues qualifies, and points you out for publick Speakers.</P>
<P>But you &s;hould remember that Solidity of Judgment is as nece&s;&s;ary for a publick In&s;tructor, as Nimblene&s;s of Tongue. Now if you are acquainted with the Hi&s;tory of your own Sex, you can't but know, they have not been &s;o much cele|brated

<P>I have indeed read, that by a &s;trange Concurrence of Cir|cum&s;tances, the famous Madam JOAN was promoted to be the fir&s;t Clergyman in Europe. But it is &s;aid that her Preg|nancy in her exalted Station, and her being &s;eized with Tra|vail, while &s;he was attending a certain grand Parade, was con|trary to the fundamental Laws of the Popedom, and a&s;to|ni&s;hed her Attendants. The Papi&s;ts them&s;elves, as much as they are devoted to the Pope, don't pretend that her Holine&s;s Pope Joan added any new Honours to the Popedom.&mdash;Now the &s;ame Inconveniencies, which befel Pope Joan, might po&s;&s;ibly befal other <HI>She-Bi&s;hops,</HI> and <HI>She Preachers.</HI></P>
<P>But old Women are not liable to &s;uch Conditions.</P>
<P>This is indeed very true. But then they are in Danger of growing <HI>&s;uperannuated.</HI> The Apo&s;tle has given a Direction to di&s;regard old Women's Fables, which intimates they don't al|ways encrea&s;e in Wi&s;dom by Age. The Stream of Prejudice again&s;t the Capacities of old Women, &s;ince the Time of the Apo&s;tle, has been &s;o great and general in the World, that mo&s;t Men, I believe, if they were to chu&s;e, had rather have one young Woman than three old ones. I am fully per&s;uaded, that unle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s an <HI>old Woman</HI> works Miracles to prove her Call to be a publick Speaker, &s;he will never be able to &s;upport her Character in this exalted Station.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould think the&s;e female Speakers and She Bi&s;hops are rather influenced by Satan, than merely by Pride and Am|bition; I would rather accommodate this Difference in Opi|nion, than enter into any warm Di&s;pute about it. For Satan may tempt them, by applying to their natural Pride and Lu&s;t for Power and Dominion. How far they are under the immediate powerful Influence of an evil Spirit in every In|&s;tance, as it is not nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o perhaps would not be ea&s;y to determine. But the mo&s;t favourable Con&s;truction that can be put upon their Conduct, is that it proceeds in a great Mea|&s;ure from mi&s;guided Zeal.</P>

a Church. But God has &s;o plainly and expre&s;sly forbidden them in his Word, that all, who have any due Regard to the Scriptures in this Particular, mu&s;t be re&s;train|ed from this &s;trange Practice, by &s;eriou&s;ly and candidly con&s;i|dering the following Pa&s;&s;ages. <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiv 34 &mdash; 38. 1 Tim. ii. 9 &mdash; 15.</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>Let the Women keep Silence with all Subjection: But I &s;uffer not a Woman to teach nor to u&s;urp Authority over the Man, but to be in Silence; For Adam was fir&s;t formed, then Eve; And Adam was not deceived, but the Woman being deceived was in the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Let your Women keep Silence in the Churches, For it is not permitted to them to &s;peak, but they are commanded to be under Subjection, as al&s;o faith the Law. And if they will learn any Thing, let them a&s;k their Hu&s;bands at Home.&mdash; For it is a Shame for Women to &s;peak in the Church.&mdash; What! Came the Word out from you, or came it unto you only? If any Man think him&s;elf to be a Prophet or Spiritual, let him acknowledge that the Things which I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord: But if any Man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</Q></P>
<P>Thus Women are expre&s;sly commanded to keep Silence in all Churches while they are a&s;&s;embled for religious Wor&s;hip. So that publick praying as well as exhorting and preaching are forbidden here.</P>
<P>But does not the Apo&s;tle Paul write thus in another Epi&s;tle, <Q>I intreat thee al&s;o true Yoke-Fellow, help tho&s;e Women which laboured with me in the Go&s;pel</Q> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Philip. iv 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>An&s;. It does not appear from the&s;e Words that Women either preached, exhorted, or prayed publickly. For there were other Labours in the Go&s;pel, in which they might be employed. We may learn from the Apo&s;tle him&s;elf, what Labours Women performed for the Service of the Church and Go&s;pel, according to the Cu&s;toms of that Time. <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. v. 9&punc; 10.</NOTE> &mdash; <Q>Let not a Widow be taken into the Number under three|&s;core Years old, having been the Wife of one Man; well reported of for good Works; if &s;he have brought up Children, if &s;he have lodged Strangers, if &s;he have wa&s;hed the Saints Feet, if &s;he have relieved the Afflicted, if &s;he

have diligently followed every good Work.</Q> Here the Apo&s;tle had an Occa&s;ion to enumerate the various Services and Labours of Women. It was thus they laboured in the Go&s;pel, if we will grant the Apo&s;tle that common Piece of Ju&s;tice, to be his own Interpreter. Peru&s;e this Pa&s;&s;age lei&s;urely. Does he mention Women's public Praying or Ex|horting in this minute Enumeration of their Labours and Services in the Go&s;pel?</P>
<P>This Interpretation, which I have given, fairly reconciles the&s;e &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of the Apo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s Writings. But accord|ing to you he &s;tatly contradicts him&s;elf, which, if you could make out, in&s;tead of confirming, your Practice would de&s;troy the Authority of the Apo&s;tle, &s;ince Contradictions could never proceed from divine In&s;piration.</P>
<P>Let none of your Adherents excu&s;e them&s;elves here, and try to wave the Matter of your Womens &s;peaking in your pretended Churches, by profe&s;&s;ing not to under&s;tand this particular Part of your Conduct. For it is as plainly con|trary to the Scriptures for Women to &s;peak or carry on in any A&s;&s;embly met for religious Wor&s;hip, as any Thing can po&s;&s;ibly be. You can't but &s;ee this, unle&s;s you wilfully &s;hut your Eyes, or are judicially blinded. When Hannah prayed &s;he &s;pake in her Heart, only her Lips moved, but her Voice was not heard.</P>
<P>You &s;hould not venture to di&s;regard any of the Commands of the great God. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord bears this Te&s;timony, <Q>Verily I &s;ay unto you, till Heaven and Earth pa&s;s, one Jot or one Title &s;hall in no wi&s;e pa&s;s from the Law, till all be fulfilled.

<P>To illu&s;trate and confirm &s;undry Things which have been &s;aid, I &s;hall now &s;ubjoin a brief Account of &s;ome of the more remarkable In&s;tances of Satan's deceiving and impo&s;ing upon Mankind.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, and indeed the mo&s;t remarkable In&s;tance of Satan's Power and Subtilty, in managing his Temptations, was that of his deceiving Eye in the Shape of the Serpent. <Q>Now the Serpent was more &s;ubtil than any Bea&s;t of the Field which the Lord God had made; and he &s;aid unto the Woman, yea, hath God &s;aid ye &s;hall not eat of every Tree of the Garden? And the Woman &s;aid unto the Serpent, We may eat of the Fruit of the Trees of the Garden; but of the Tree which is in the mid&s;t of the Garden, God hath &s;aid, ye &s;hall not eat of it, neither &s;hall ye touch it, le&s;t ye die. And the Serpent &s;aid unto the Woman, ye &s;hall not &s;urely die. For God doth know, that in the Day ye eat there|of then your Eyes &s;hall be opened; and ye &s;hall be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil.</Q> &amp;c. Was not the Power of Sa|tan in managing this, Temptation very great, when he put Words into the Mouth of the Serpent or Snake, a Creature that is by Nature dumb, and thus begun and carried on a Conver&s;ation with the Woman? It is worthy to be remarked that he managed this fir&s;t Temptation by bringing a new Re|velation, <HI>different from, and contrary to</HI> that which God him&s;elf had expre&s;sly revealed. But it was a Revelation that pro|mi&s;ed them great Things. <Q>Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die&mdash;Ye &s;hall be as Gods.</Q> And Satan to this Day, when he tempts Men to Sin often and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avours to per&s;uade them that they &s;hall

not &s;urely die; but are in a very &s;afe State, in the direct Way to eternal Life</P>
<P>We have another notable In&s;tance of Satan's Power, and Ma|lice when he was permitted to afflict Job. How <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n did he &s;end the Sabeans and Chaldeans to &s;eize upon his Oxen, A&s;&s;es, and Cames, and &s;lay his Servants?

If this powerful and malicious Adver&s;ary had but Per|mi&s;&s;ion, he would &s;oon turn this World into a hideous Wil|derne&s;s.</P>
<P>What &s;urpri&s;ing Wonders did he enable Pharaoh's Magici|ans or Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers to perform, tho' they were at la&s;t &s;hameful|ly buff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d with all their Enchantments, by the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous Mi|racles which the Lord wrought by his Servant Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>"But Satan can not only work very wonderful Things be|fore Men i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an external Manner, but he can al&s;o work inter|nally on their Minds. He thought it not enough to tempt Judas, by the Object of Gain, but he broke his Mind in direct Terms and <HI>put it into</HI> his Heart.

He wore a Crown of Gold on his Head, and his Titles were the King of Ju&s;tice, the King of the new Jeru&s;alem. When this great Monarch went abroad he had always two Harbengers before him, of whom one carried a Sword, and the other a Bible. All who did not fall down and wor&s;hip him were &s;entenced to die, and immediately executed. He cau&s;ed one of his Concu|bines to be put to Death for de&s;pi&s;ing his pretended In&s;pirati|ons. He &s;pirited up the Citizens to make a mo&s;t re&s;olute De|fence, a&s;&s;uring them all the while of a miraculous Deliverance. And &s;o &s;trong was the Infatuation, that tho' Multitudes of them were daily de&s;troyed, they held out till they had &s;uffered almo&s;t as much as the Jews did, when Jeru&s;alem was taken by Ve&s;|pa&s;ian. The town was taken at la&s;t, and the mock King with his two principal A&s;&s;ociates were &s;ent in Deri&s;ion about the Country. He was afterwards put to Death by having his Fle&s;h torn off with red hot Pincers. Some who &s;urvived the Siege were &s;till &s;o confident in their Revelations, as to expect they &s;hould have all the World at their Command in a very little Time.&mdash;The&s;e were &s;trong Delu&s;ions! &s;uch were the Fa|thers of the Bapti&s;ts. Likely Per&s;ons to under&s;tand the Scrip|tures!</P>
<P>That was a very remarkable Impul&s;e, which Lord HERBERT of Cherbury, the fir&s;t noted Dei&s;tical Writer, was led by to publi&s;h his Book again&s;t the Chri&s;tian Religion, as revealed in the Scriptures. <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Leland's View of Dei&s;tical Writers, Let. 2.</NOTE> As the Frame of his whole Book was &s;o different from what had ever been written on the Subject, and he apprehended he &s;hould meet with much Oppo&s;ition, he did con&s;ider, whether it were not better for him for a while to &s;uppre&s;s it.</P>
<P><Q>Being thus, &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, doubtful in my Cham|ber, one fair Day in the Summer, my Ca&s;ement being open towards the South, the Sun &s;hining clear, and no Wind &s;tirring, I took my Book, <HI>de Veritate</HI> in my Hands, and kneeling on my Knees, devoutly &s;aid the Words, <HI>O

Sign from Heaven to determine him. This &s;eems to be putting it on a wrong Foot, &s;ince God hath not in his Word given us any Ground to expect that he will an&s;wer &s;uch a Reque&s;t; nor is there any Rea&s;on to expect it from the Nature of the Thing.&mdash;I believe it will be acknowledged that &s;udden Impre&s;&s;ions or &s;uppo&s;ed Signs from Heaven, like that upon which Lord <HI>Herbert</HI> &s;eemeth to lay &s;o great Stre&s;s, are very equivocal, and not much to be depended up|on for Information in Truth or Direction in Duty. They may lay Per&s;ons open to Mi&s;take and Delu&s;ion. It cannot be denied that in &s;uch Ca&s;es Men are in Danger of being impo&s;ed upon by the Warmth of their own Imaginations e&s;|pecially if they be wrought up to a &s;trong De&s;ire and Ex|pectation of an extraordinary Sign from Heaven, in Favour of a De&s;ign which they heartily wi&s;h &s;hould &s;ucceed.</Q></P>
<P>Since I have found &s;ome Per&s;ons who have di&s;covered a great Regard for &s;uch Signs or Tokens, I will add that whatever might be &s;aid to excu&s;e Lord <HI>Herbert,</HI> who did not pretend to believe the Holy Scriptures, in his following this Sign, it mu&s;t certainly be very ab&s;urd for Chri&s;tians, who profe&s;s to believe that the Scriptures are a perfect Rule, to look for &s;uch Tokens. When they are at a Lo&s;s about what is their Duty, why don't they diligently &s;earch the Scriptures and a&s;k the Advice of &s;uch as are prudent? If they don't &s;earch the Scriptures is not this to treat them with Neglect?</P>
<P>It is true, that God &s;ometimes gave Intimations of his Will under the Old Te&s;tament by Signs or Tokens. But it was tho&s;e whom he favoured with immediate Revelations, as the Prophets, &amp;c. to whom he gave &s;uch Signs, and that on extraordinary Occa&s;ions. Others were to enquire the Word of the Lord from the Prophets, and to con&s;ult the divine Law and Te&s;timony. Where God gave no Intimations, that he would grant them Signs, it was unwarrantable to look for them. They had no Right to demand Signs. Chri&s;t would not gratify the captious Phari&s;ees when they demanded a par|ticular Sign from Heaven, but referred them to what the Scrip|tures had declared. And &s;o on another Occa&s;ion, <Q>they have, Mo&s;es and the Prophets let them hear them.</Q></P>
<P>Whatever God was plea&s;ed to grant to his People, while Pro|phets were rai&s;ed up from Time to Time, this can afford no
<PB N="162" REF="009120_0091_1030F3388218BE40">
Warrant at all to us now after the Scriptures are fully com|pleted, to expect Signs from Heaven. It &s;hould be remem|bered, that <Q>God who at &s;undry Times and in divers Man|ners &s;pake in Time pa&s;t unto the Fathers by the Prophets hath in the&s;e la&s;t Days &s;poken unto us by his Son.</Q> Hence the former Methods or immediate Revelations by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Prophets, Dreams, Vi&s;ions, Signs, Tokens are not to be ex|pected: God has revealed his whole Will which he de&s;igned to communicate to his Church <HI>at once,</HI> by Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles. After this one Sea&s;on, no further immediate Reve|lations were to be granted. Such Methods are laid a&s;ide. This is evidently implied in the Text. The Antithe&s;is plainly re|quires it. Since the Canon of Scripture is thus fully compleated, there is no Need of &s;uch Revelations, Signs and Tokens. Con&s;equently it mu&s;t be vain Pre&s;umption for any to expect them. To follow &s;uch Signs is to follow Delu&s;ions.</P>
<P>Such a Notion would give cunning Impo&s;tors a great Ad|vantage to contrive Schemes before Hand, and thus to de|ceive the &s;imple and unwary. And who would engage that they would not knowingly and wittingly attempt to deceive; when it is certain Wondermongers have been detected in a thou&s;and In&s;tances of pious Fraud among Heathens and Pa|pi&s;ts? And who can tell what &s;trange and to us unaccountable Signs, "the Prince of the Power of the Air" may if permit|ted give to tho&s;e who tru&s;t to &s;uch Things. If there was any Thing more in the Sign upon which Lord <HI>Herbert</HI> publi&s;hed his Book again&s;t the Scriptures; or in that upon which the <HI>Dutartres</HI> acted than imagination, I leave it to all &s;ober Chri&s;|tians to &s;ay whence it came. And &s;ince Satan would be rea|dy to deceive if any Stre&s;s was laid on uncertain, doubtful Signs, it is certainly nece&s;&s;ary that proper Miracles be wrought to di&s;tingui&s;h the true from the fal&s;e, and to prove that &s;uch a Sign comes from God and not from the Devil; otherwi&s;e Per|&s;ons may, as appears from the In&s;tances of the Dutartres, be led to commit the mo&s;t &s;hocking Crimes, while they follow &s;uch Signs and Tokens.</P>
<P>This &s;urprizing Incident of Lord <HI>Herbert,</HI> this immediate An&s;wer which he imagined he received to his Prayer, may &s;erve as a Caution and Warning to Chri&s;tians again&s;t making Reque&s;ts to God for immediate Directions by &s;uch Signs, and
<PB N="163" REF="009120_0091_1030F3388218BE40">
prevent them from following what they might perhaps imagine an expre&s;s Imitation from Heaven in immediate An&s;wers to their Prayers.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t extraordinary In&s;tance of Enthu&s;ia&s;m I have met with in Modern Times, is that of the French Prophets. From June 1688, to the End of February following there aro&s;e in <HI>Dauphiny,</HI> and then in <HI>Vivarais,</HI> five or &s;ix hundred Prote&s;tants of both Sexes, who gave out that they were Prophets in&s;pired by the Holy Gho&s;t. As Mankind are apt to be taken with Novelty, and the injudicious to be fond of Extraordinaries, they &s;oon became very numerous. The Burden of their Exhor|tations and Prophecies was, <HI>Amend your Lives, repent ye, the End of all Things draws nigh.</HI></P>
<P>The Account which Mr. John Lacy has written of them, who was afterwards him&s;elf the chief of the Engli&s;h Prophets that was &s;eized with the &s;ame Spirit, and which he &s;ays was verified upon Oath and other Proofs, is very wonderful. I &s;hall mention but a few In&s;tances referring the inqui&s;itive Rea|der to the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See his Cry to the De&s;art.</NOTE> Book it&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q>John Vernett, of Bois-Ca&s;tle declared at London, January 14, 1706. That the fir&s;t Per&s;ons he &s;aw under In&s;piration were his own Mother, his two Si&s;ters, and a Cou&s;in; that his Mother &s;poke, at the Time of In&s;piration, only <HI>French;</HI> which &s;urpri&s;ed him exceedingly,&mdash;becau&s;e &s;he never, before her <HI>In&s;pirations</HI> attempted to &s;peak a Word in that Language; nor has &s;ince to his Knowledge; and he is certain &s;he could not do it. He &s;ays the &s;ame of his Si&s;ters, and that they all urged their Hearers to Amendment of Life, and pre&s;t it upon him in particular (who was then a little loo&s;e) to be &s;ober. He went with two of his Acquaintance, to &s;ee a Friend of theirs near <HI>Vernoux;</HI> that as they were drink|ing together, a Girl came to call her Mother, who was with them, to &s;ee the Child&mdash;They all ran immediately. The Child was <HI>Thirteen</HI> or <HI>Fourteen</HI> Months old, and covered then in the Cradle, and had never <HI>of it&s;elf</HI> &s;poken a Word, nor could it go alone. When they were come in where it was, the Child <HI>&s;poke di&s;tinctly</HI> in French, with a Voice &s;mall like a Child, but loud enough to be heard all over the Room. It
<PB N="164" REF="009120_0092_1030F33E651C84D0">
exhorted like others in that Condition, to the Work of Re|pentance. The Room where the Child was had about twen|ty Per&s;ons in it, who were, mo&s;t of them, round the Cradle weeping and praying.</Q></P>
<P>CLAND ARNASSAN, of <HI>Montel,</HI> declared on the 14th of Janu|ary, 1706, among other Things as followeth&mdash;<Q>In the Hou&s;e of my Father at <HI>Montel,</HI> a Shepherd who look't to my Father's Sheep, named <HI>Peter Bernaut,</HI> &s;o &s;illy he was next to an Ideot, be&s;ought me &s;everal Times, to carry him to an A&s;&s;embly; which I was afraid to do le&s;t thro' his Weak|ne&s;s he &s;hould betray tho&s;e Affairs: Neverthele&s;s, one Time I did venture to lead him to an A&s;&s;embly by Night. <HI>Peter</HI> being there I ob&s;erved him to keep upon his Knees, for two Hours together at lea&s;t; then the Gift &s;eized him, he was &s;truck as it were dead: And after &s;ome Time, had violent Agitations of Body. He returning Home, the Spirit came upon him again, the following Day. At which Time his Bo|dily Motions were &s;o great, that being on his Back the whole Body leapt from the Ground. We were all afraid he would hurt him&s;elf upon the Pavement. He continued to batter him&s;elf in that Manner, that his Hair was as wet with Sweat as if dipt in Water. Two or three Times was he ta|ken with the&s;e violent <HI>Contortions,</HI> without &s;peaking. At length he &s;aid, it was for his Sins he had been thus torment|ed. After that, in other In&s;pirations he &s;pake aloud, quoting appo&s;itely many Texts of Scripture, and all to pre&s;s us ear|ne&s;tly to a good Life. As for this Man, I am certain he could not read. He never was at Divine Wor&s;hip but that Time, nor was he capable to be in&s;tructed by any Per&s;on what&s;oever, to &s;peak the Things he &s;aid in his In&s;pirations.</Q></P>
<P>They encrea&s;ed greatly in &s;pite of all Oppo&s;ition, and very &s;evere Per&s;ecutions, in which many of them were put to Death; &s;o that in a few Years there were &s;everal Thou&s;ands of them, from whom, I might, if it were needful, pre&s;ent you with Mul|titudes of the like Nature and Tendency with the&s;e already men|tioned.</P>
<P>Sometime in the Year 1706, three or four of the&s;e Prophets came over into England, and brought their prophetic Spirit along with them, which &s;oon &s;pread among others, &s;o that before the Year was out, there were two or three hundred of
<PB N="165" REF="009120_0092_1030F33E651C84D0">
the&s;e Prophets in and about London of both Sexes, of all Ages, Men, Women and Children; and they had delivered four or five hundred prophetic Warnings.</P>
<P>We may have a lively Idea of the Genius of the&s;e Prophets from the Relation of Mr. <HI>John Lacy,</HI> which he introduces in the&s;e Words, "I give what follows, which doth particularly concern my&s;elf, with the &s;ame Awfulne&s;s and Appeal to the Searcher of all Hearts, as if I were called by Authority to do it upon Oath."</P>
<Q><P>Having from November la&s;t, to the Beginning of Febru|ary following, been pre&s;ent divers Times at the Exta&s;ies of Mr. <HI>Marien,</HI> Mr. <HI>Fage,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cavalier;</HI> I can &s;ay, that their Agitation did never make any Impre&s;&s;ion on my Mind or Imagination, &s;uch as to promote an Imitation of them or even an Inclination to it. For the Space of at lea&s;t eighteen Days before mine came upon me, I had &s;een none of them; and mine were &s;o intirely different from any of theirs, that it is altogether unlikely that the Force of Imagination, as &s;ome with|out Con&s;ideration have fancied, could produce them&mdash;The fir&s;t Symptoms of the Emotions on my Body &s;urprized me in the In&s;tant of awaking, on the fir&s;t Day of March;&mdash;and con|tinued more or le&s;s upon me unto the twelfth Day of June, before the Word was put into my Mouth.&mdash;I can po&s;itively &s;ay, I never once expected or de&s;ired to have them before I was actually &s;eized with them: But as they came not of my Will or De&s;ire, &s;o I know they came in Con&s;equence of my frequent Prayers, that God would guide me aright in my Opi|nion and Judgment of that awful Subject of In&s;piration, a|mong the <HI>Covennes,</HI> whereof I had been then, and for two Months before preparing the Relation.&mdash;The bodily Impre&s;|&s;ions were gradually increa&s;ing upon me, until the Effect or rather I&s;&s;ue of them was produced, viz. <HI>the opening my Mouth to &s;peak.</HI></P>
<P>They began by a preternatural Cour&s;e of Breathing, then my Head came to be agitated or &s;haken violently and forci|bly, and with a quick Motion horizontally, or from Side to Side. Then my Stomach had Twitches not much unlike an Hickup; afterwards my Hands and Arms were violently &s;haken; at length a &s;truggle or a Labouring in the Wind|pipe, and &s;ometimes a Sort of Catching or Twitches all

over my Body; and about a Week before my Speaking, I ob&s;erved my Tongue was now and then moved involunta|rily, as were al&s;o my Lips, my Mouth, and Jaw &s;everally; all which Preparation of the bodily Organs, I found atten|ded with a con&s;tant Elevation of Soul to God, the Mind being <HI>unaccountably</HI> ca&s;t into a Frame of <HI>&s;piritual Joy,</HI> holy Contempt of all Things in the World, and ince&s;&s;ant Prayers far more earne&s;t and intent than what I had ever found be|fore&mdash;My &s;ecret Prayers were in&s;eparably attended with the Encrea&s;e of tho&s;e Symptoms, and during all this Time, I &s;earched the Scriptures carefully, for my Directi|on, and heedfully con&s;idered all the Advices given me by my Friends.</P>
<P>After &s;o much Care and Fear of being deluded, I am the better a&s;&s;ured, and do affirm without the lea&s;t Doubt, that my Agitations and Words in the Exta&s;y are produced by a &s;uperior Agent, and are independant of me any further than that I do not, nor dare not oppo&s;e, but do remain alto|gether pa&s;&s;ive&mdash;My Mind at tho&s;e Times continues clear and &s;edate, during which my Fear and Caution make me wait always, until the Tongue be moved by that &s;uperior Power; nor doth any Impul&s;e alone prevail with me therein: So that it is no longer I, as the Prime voluntary Mover and Agent that &s;peak, and oftentimes I know not the Sen&s;e until the Words are &s;poken, and &s;o heard by me as by other Per|&s;ons pre&s;ent. Nor did <HI>I my&s;elf</HI> write tho&s;e Engli&s;h Words, which are contained in the Warning of the twelfth of July; but my Fingers were forcibly moved to do it, my Eyes then being &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and I under Agitations.

I have moreover thrice experienced a <HI>Tone</HI> or <HI>Manner</HI> in <HI>the Voice it&s;elf,</HI> which I am well a&s;&s;ured, I am no Ways capable of, in my natural State.</P>
<P>I have great Rea&s;on to ble&s;s God for having had a vertuous Education, and for the Grace he has &s;ince vouch|&s;afed me never to allow my&s;elf to live in the Practice of any known Sin; nor deliberately, or pre&s;umptuou&s;ly, to commit any one &s;uch Act.&mdash;I have therefore the more Confidence that God doth not now deliver me up to &s;o horrid a Delu|&s;ion, as the voluntary &s;peaking of my&s;elf in his Per&s;on would

<P>As to the Ob&s;ervation of the Lord's Day, it has plea&s;ed God to vouch&s;afe me his gracious Vi&s;its, more frequently and &s;olemnly on tho&s;e Days than on others. I therefore with Joy and Comfort wait for them: A Voice that comes to me frequently in my Clo&s;et, as well as before Company (which upon all the Enquiry, Rea&s;oning, Caution. Fear and Deliberation, that I am capable of) I do firmly believe to be from God; con&s;equently I dare not di&s;obey, hide or &s;title, under the Dread of thereby charging my Con&s;cience with a I oad of Guilt and Horror un&s;upportable; although at the &s;ame Time I am &s;en&s;ible what numerous Reproaches, what Lo&s;s, what Difficulties, what Hazzards, what Trouble, what Labour, what Clamours and Contempt, the owning my&s;elf to be in&s;pired, has done, doth, and will engage me in&mdash;I would not &s;urely have unnece&s;&s;arily brought my&s;elf under any of the&s;e; nor could I now, by my own proper Strength bear up under them. But the inward Joy that I have from the great Comforter, has from the Beginning &s;upported me, and I tru&s;t it will continue &s;o to do, and make me in his due Time triumphant over all.</P></Q>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all this Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Confidence, which the&s;e Prophets di&s;covered, it is certain beyond any rea|&s;onable Doubt that this Bu&s;ine&s;s of In&s;piration was wholly a S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne of Impo&s;ture, Delu&s;ion or overheated Imagination, or a Mixture of them all. This might be made evident from va|rious Topicks, which &s;undry eminent Divines who lived in tho&s;e Times, well improved and urged again&s;t them&mdash;But if
<PB N="168" REF="009120_0094_1030F3438964A5D8">
there had been Nothing be&s;ides the palpable Failuers of their Predictions, this alone would have been &s;ufficient to convince every Man who believes the Scriptures, that they were not in|&s;pired by God. For this is a Mark which God him&s;elf has given us in his written Word of a fal&s;e Prophecy. See Deut. xviii. 21, 22. <Q>If thou &s;ay in thine Heart, how &s;hall we know the Word which the Lord hath not &s;poken? When a Prophet &s;peaketh in the Name of the Lord, if the Thing follow not, nor come to pa&s;s, that is the Thing which the Lord hath not &s;poken.</Q></P>
<P>As the Lord employs Satan to inflict Vengeance on his in|corrigible Enemies, as in the Ca&s;e of wicked <HI>Ahab;</HI> and permits him &s;ometimes to afflict his Saints, as in the In&s;tance of <HI>Job;</HI> this Deceiver at Times may have &s;ome Intimations of the Divine Will about &s;ome future Events. Be&s;ides Satan is a profound Politician, and has had great Experience in human Affairs, and in many In&s;tances may give a very near Gue&s;s at Things to come. But as he is not endowed with ab&s;olute Knowledge, he may be mi&s;taken him&s;elf. And it is very cer|tain, that he makes it his grand Bu&s;ine&s;s to deceive Mankind. But God knows all Things, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come. Such is his infinite Perfection he cannot be deceived him&s;elf, nor attempt to lead his Creatures into a Mi&s;take, by revealing a Fal&s;hood to them.

<P>The chief Purport of the&s;e Prophet's Predictions was to warn the World of the near Approach of the Kingdom of God; and the happy Times of the Church; which were to be u&s;hered in by terrible Judgments executed on the Wicked, univer&s;ally throughout the World; which were to root out the Tares and leave only good Corn, A PURE CHURCH, upon the Earth; all which was to be manife&s;t over the whole World within a &s;hort Term of three Years, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>The&s;e Prophe&s;ies of the Doctor's Re&s;urrection, delivered &s;o often, with &s;uch great particularity, and Confidence; and all under the Agitations and In&s;pirations of the Spirit, could not fail to make a great Noi&s;e in the Nation. Such was the Alarm of this predicted Miracle, that the Queen's Guard was po&s;ted on Bunhillfields on the 25th of May the Day appointed for its being wrought to prevent Di&s;orders. Twenty thou&s;and People from one Motive and another a&s;&s;embled, and no Doubt many of them with an Expectation of &s;eeing the Doctor ri&s;e from his Grave. But there he lies, and will lie, till the Voice of the Arch-Angel at the la&s;t Day &s;hall awake the Dead and &s;ummon them to Judgment. Nothing remarkable happened on that noted 25th of May at Bunhillfields; only the va&s;t Con|cour&s;e of People, and &s;uch a woful Di&s;appointment to the&s;e Prophets, as brought them, with <HI>Ahab</HI>'s Prophets of old when
<PB N="171" REF="009120_0095_1030F346F32A4C10">
they attempted to prove the Divinity of Baal by a Miracle, into great Di&s;grace, and gave &s;uch a Check to their Spirit that there was little or no Appearance of it afterwards. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They who de&s;ire a fuller Account of the&s;e French Prophets may con&s;ult Dr. Edmund Calamy's Caveat; Owen's Scene of Delu&s;ion opened; Hick's Spirit of Enthu&s;ia&s;m exerci&s;ed; the Hi&s;tory of Montani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m; Dr. Hoadly's Vindication of the ancient Prophets again&s;t the Preten&s;ions of the new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>There is no Need to enquire with much Solicitude how far &s;ome of the&s;e Prophets exaggerated their Feelings or counter|feited them. There plainly appears an Hone&s;ty in their Re|lations; and no Doubt there was Something very extraordinary in this Scene which they acted, though they might as is natu|ral to Mankind, endeavour to repre&s;ent their Cau&s;e to the be&s;t Advantage, and thus perhaps embelli&s;h &s;ome Things beyond the Truth.</P>
<P>As to their &s;peaking in Languages which they had never learned, it is to be ob&s;erved, that they only &s;poke in &s;uch Lan|guages, when they were under the forcible Agitations of their Spirit. They had, as appears from their own Accounts, no more Skill in tho&s;e Languages afterwards, than before. This then was not the Gift of Tongues which the Divine Spirit gave to the Apo&s;tles, and &s;ome of the fir&s;t Converts to Chri&s;tianity. It was a di&s;tant, and but a di&s;tant Imitation of it&mdash;This was not &s;o wonderful as for Satan to cau&s;e the Serpent to &s;peak, that is by Nature dumb. And it &s;eems that, like the Serpent, they &s;pake as they were impelled, their &s;peaking Organs being forcibly moved by that Agent for who&s;e Motions they waited.</P>
<P>Had they &s;teadfa&s;tly adhered to the written Word of God, and not looked for any Revelations but tho&s;e contained in the Bible, Satan would not have found an Opportunity of befool|ing them in &s;uch a prodigious Manner. But where Men will look for Extraordinaries, when they will run after Wonder|mongers, they may thank them&s;elves, if Satan lends them &s;ometimes a helping Hand, and holds forth a fal&s;e Light to tho&s;e who are &s;o very willing to follow him.</P>
<P>When the French Prophets were overruled by divine Pro|vidence to bring their Prophecies, Revelations, &amp;c. to be tried by the right Te&s;t, that is, by genuine, public Miracles, they &s;oon di&s;covered their Delu&s;ions. Some of the Ancient Here|ticks,
<PB N="172" REF="009120_0096_1030F3488873E120">
and many among the Super&s;titious Papi&s;ts have pretend|ed, that Miracles have been wrought in Proof of their Reli|gion. But they were <HI>&s;ecret</HI> Miracles, &s;ome of them like Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation were always &s;o invi&s;ible, that they could never be &s;een but by Hear&s;ay. And others of them were never heard of till many Years after they are &s;aid to have been wrought. If the Popi&s;h Wonders were not mere Impo&s;ture, why were they not wrought before &s;ome of their under&s;tanding Oppo&s;ers among Prote&s;tants, as well as before their own &s;u|per&s;titious Bigots, and fond Admirers? Chri&s;t wrought his Miracles before his mo&s;t cunning and fierce&s;t Oppo&s;ers as well as before his own Di&s;ciples and dear Friends. His Enemies them&s;elves could not but own that he and his Di&s;ciples wro't many glorious Miracles. The Jews confe&s;&s;ed this. Julian, the learned and malicious Apo&s;tate, confe&s;&s;ed this. The&s;e Mi|racles were wrought &s;o publickly that they could not deny them. But the pretended Wonders of Papi&s;ts and Enthu&s;ia&s;ts have been often detected, and clearly di&s;covered to be No|thing but the artful Inventions of cunning Deceivers, to blind the ignorant and credulous, to rai&s;e the Credit, and encrea&s;e the Number of their Party, or to wheedle them the more ea&s;ily out of their Money; or el&s;e they are &s;ome &s;trange Appearances pro|duced by the Power and Subtilty of Satan. Such are the&s;e famous &s;ecret Wonders. They are therefore called <HI>lying Wonders</HI> with the greate&s;t Propriety, in the Scriptures. But let us al|ways in&s;i&s;t upon public Miracles. This is an infallible Te&s;t which will always demon&s;trate the Truth of divine Revelation, to the Confu&s;ion of Deceivers, and clearly di&s;tingui&s;h it from, all Counterfeits. Let Men produce the Evidence of proper Miracles, &s;uch as rai&s;ing the Dead, &amp;c. to recommend their new Revelations, or let them not pretend to be in&s;pired.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t be &s;ome Mark or Character by which we may di&s;tingui&s;h divine Revelation from &s;uch as are fal&s;e and ima|ginary. For it appears to be no new Thing for Men to pre|tend they are under the immediate Direction of God and re|ceive divine In&s;tructions from Heaven. The Authors and Ring-leaders of new Sects have generally made this Pretence. It was &s;o in the Heathen as well as in the Chri&s;tian World. When <HI>Numa Pompilius</HI> introduced the ancient Romi&s;h Super|&s;tition he pretended to be directed in all he did by the Godde&s;s
<PB N="173" REF="009120_0096_1030F3488873E120">
<HI>Egeria.</HI> Triptolemus, to recommend his Laws to the Atheni|ans, gave out that he was in&s;pired by <HI>Ceres.</HI> Licurgus pro|fe&s;&s;ed to act by the Direction of the God, Apollo, when he pro|mulgated his extraordinary Laws to the Spartans. And it was common throughout the Heathen World, when any re|markable Change was to be made, or any important Enterpri&s;e to be undertaken, for &s;ome of tho&s;e who favoured it, to pre|tend to &s;ome new Revelation or Oracle in Support of their Opinion. Now though there is the mo&s;t undeniable Evidence to prove that many of their Revelations and An&s;wers of their Oracles were Nothing but the Contrivance of crafty Knaves, downright Cheat and Impo&s;ture; yet for any Thing I have ever &s;een proved, &s;ome of their oracular Re&s;pon&s;es might be &s;upernatural, from the immediate Agency of the Devil The Fathers, who had much better Opportunities to be acquainted with the Revelations of the Heathens, than we, as they lived, &s;ome of them at lea&s;t, while the Oracles were con&s;ulted, ge|nerally agreed that the Devil had a great Hand in fir&s;t intro|ducing, and con&s;tantly &s;upporting the pagan Oracles and Re|velations.</P>
<P>Such as are prejudiced again&s;t the Bible may imagine, that the many Pretences that have been made to divine Revelation by Enthu&s;ia&s;ts and Impo&s;tors are a &s;ufficient Confutation of the Scriptures. But &s;uch an Imagination mu&s;t be owing to their great Inattention or inveterate Prejudices. For if the Matter be fully and candidly examined, the various Preten|&s;ions that have been made only prove, what I have once and again inculcated that we &s;hould receive no Revelations as di|vine, 'till we have ju&s;t Grounds to believe they come from God: We mu&s;t not receive them for divine till they are re|commended by proper Miracles. Enthu&s;ia&s;ts and Impo&s;tors pretend to divine Revelation, but have never been able to work any Miracles to prove the Truth of their Pretentions.</P>
<P>The Prophets and Apo&s;tles profe&s;&s;ed to be in&s;pired and wrought &s;uch glorious Miracles as fully proved that God was with them, and that they acted by his Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Fondne&s;s which Mankind in every Nation have &s;hewed for divine Revelation, the Greedine&s;s, with which they have re|ceived the various Preten&s;ions of this Kind, in&s;tead of weaken|ing the Credibility of the Scriptures rather affords a good Ar|gument
<PB N="174" REF="009120_0097_1030F34A17AA3A40">
to confirm their divine Authority. For whence &s;hould this Di&s;po&s;ition and Practice of Mankind ari&s;e? What can be the Rea&s;on they have been &s;o ready to look for and give Cre|dit to divine Revelation? Is it not becau&s;e they are con&s;cience to them&s;elves they have great Need of a Guide to direct them? Or from &s;ome univer&s;al Tradition that God had actually grant|ed &s;ome Revelations? If Men did not feel them&s;elves ex|tremely in the dark if they had not heard from Tradition, or by their Intercour&s;e with the Jews, that there was a divine Revelation; is it not probable they would have been &s;o rea|dy to follow tho&s;e who pretended to extraordinary Commu|nications. But having been informed that the Deity had grant|ed immediate Revelation to &s;ome excellent Per&s;on, they might be impo&s;ed on and follow tho&s;e who pretended to this Inter|cour&s;e with Heaven, e&s;pecially as they found the Light very in&s;ufficient for their Direction.</P>
<P>All who are acquainted with the religious Cu&s;toms of the ancient Heathens know there were &s;undry U&s;ages among them which bore &s;ome Re&s;emblance to &s;ome of the Ceremonies which we find were pre&s;cribed by the Jewi&s;h Law-Giver. The&s;e they undoubtedly derived from the Patriarchal Cu&s;toms or borrowed from the Jews. <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">As to what &s;ome learned Men have conjectured, that many of the Laws of Mo&s;es were in&s;tituted partly in Compliance to the Prejudices of the Jews, who were fond of the Egyptian Super&s;titions; this is an idle Imagination, which is, and always will be de&s;titute of all proper Evidence.

by the &s;acred Hi&s;torian the Samaritans did to an&s;wer their now Ends. Now &s;ince it appears that the Heathens derived &s;ome of their religious Ceremonies from the Jews, or from the Pa|triarchs, why might they not derive the general Notion of a Revelation from the &s;ame Quarter?</P>
<P>If there never had been any true Revelation given to Man|kind, what could have led the Heathen Prie&s;ts and and Law-Givers to counterfeit them? <Q>Can there be Copies without Originals? Or Counterfeits without Realities? Do not fal&s;e Coiners imitate the noble&s;t Metals?

The Ri&s;e of fal&s;e Prophets mere Pretenders to In&s;piration, was expre&s;sly &s;ore told by Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles; &s;o that their Appearance in the World is a completion of their Pro|phecies, and as it were a Seal which we our&s;elves &s;ee put to the New-Te&s;tament, the more fully to illu&s;trate and Confirm the Divine Authority of the Scriptures. God will not &s;uffer any of his Words to fall to the Ground, let the Things foretold be ever &s;o unlikely to human Rea&s;on. Now mu&s;t not that Prophe&s;y have proceeded from God which is thus exactly verified by the Event? The Scriptures have been confirmed by &s;o many infallible Proofs and the&s;e Arguments have been placed in &s;uch a convincing Light, and all the Cavils that have been rai&s;ed, have been &s;o fully an&s;wered by many excellent Writers, that one cannot but think that Infidels di&s;cover Want of Sen&s;e, as well as Want of Faith: who &s;till per&s;i&s;t in their Unbe|lief.

<P>There is hardly any Thing which Enthu&s;ia&s;ts in general plead more &s;trongly for their Practices than Con&s;cience, and it is to be feared many plead Con&s;cience who &s;carcely know what Con|&s;cience means. As this is evidently the Ca&s;e, it will not be ami&s;s briefly to explain the Nature of Con&s;cience, that you

may not plead it; where it cannot lay under a proper Obliga|tion.</P>
<P>The Will and Law of God is holy, ju&s;t and good, which all moral Agents are bound in Duty to obey by what Means &s;oever it is made known to them. This is the &s;upreme Rule and original Standard of all moral Goodne&s;s. God has been plea&s;ed to di&s;cover this his Will to Mankind in &s;everal Ways, as by Con&s;cience, Rea&s;on, Revelation. <HI>Con&s;cience is that Pow|er of the Soul, by which God gives Mankind &s;ome Notices of his Will, of Virtue and Vice, of Prai&s;e and Blame, and by which, when it is in right Exerci&s;e, we approve of whatever, we have &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to believe is agreeable to the holy Will of God, whether in our&s;elves or others, and Condemn what is contrary to this divine Standard.</HI> <Q>When the Gentiles, <HI>&s;ays the Apo&s;tle,</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rom ii. 14 15.</NOTE> which have not the <HI>[written]</HI> Law, do by Nature the Things contained in the Law, the&s;e having not the Law, are a Law unto them|&s;elves; which &s;hew the Work of the Law written in their Hearts, their Con&s;cience al&s;o bearing Witne&s;s, and their Thoughts the mean while accu&s;ing, or el&s;e excu&s;ing one a|nother.</Q> Hence Con&s;cience is called God's Deputy or Vice|gerent in the Soul. When any Thing is known to be agreea|ble to the Will of God, Con&s;cience in its proper Exerci&s;e urge to obey, and remon&s;trates again&s;t Di&s;obedience, threatning Pu|ni&s;hment from God. But Con&s;cience is only a Deputy. It is not Con&s;cience of it&s;elf which properly binds or obliges a Man, but the Will and Law of God which is written in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Records. Con&s;cience derives all its ju&s;t Authority from God.</P>
<P>Truth and Fal&s;hood, Right and Wrong, cannot be changed by the Fancies of Men. The Will of God remains &s;till the &s;ame. Hence though &s;uch is the natural Frame and Con&s;ti|tution of Human Nature, that an hone&s;t Man cannot but fol|low his Con&s;cience; though he would &s;in, if he &s;hould coun|teract the Dictates of his Mind, and be &s;elf-condemned, as the Apo&s;tle <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 23.</NOTE> intimates; yet when Con&s;cience is mi&s;informed, and abu&s;es its Office, repre&s;enting Right to be Wrong, and Wrong to be Right; this Mi&s;take cannot alter the Nature of Things nor change the divine Law. A Man is not <HI>properly obliged</HI> in this Ca&s;e to act contrary to the Will of God, but is rather bound to renounce his Errors and &s;earch out the divine Law
<PB N="180" REF="009120_0100_1030F35576840630">
and obey it. Paul before he was converted verily believed in his Con&s;cience, that he ought to do many Things in Oppo&s;i|tion to Je&s;us of Nazareth: Yet when he came to be better informed, he blamed him&s;elf, and lamented over that Conduct as &s;inful. Tho' his mi&s;taken Con&s;cience did in &s;ome Mea&s;ure alleviate his Crime, yet he was far from thinking it entirely excu&s;ed him. He <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1. Tim. i. 13,&mdash;16.</NOTE> mentions it as a Sin for which he had Need of Mercy. When forty of the Jews in their great Zeal judged in their Con&s;ciences, they ought to murder Paul, this did not render Murder a Virtue, and &s;uch Conduct acceptable to God. Their Con&s;cience in this In&s;tance had not God's Au|thority.</P>
<P>As Con&s;cience is not the only Means by which God reveals his Will &s;ince he has given us Rea&s;on and Revelation, &s;o it is al&s;o greatly enfeebled in this imperfect State, and often mi&s;|takes the divine Will. Therefore its ha&s;ty Dictates &s;hould not be ra&s;hly obeyed. Rea&s;on and Revelation &s;hould be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ulted, lea&s;t Men in&s;tead of obeying the holy Will of God &s;hould be found following the Dictates of their own corrupted Under&s;tandings or the Sugge&s;tions of Satan. And &s;ince the Will of God is the only perfect Rule and original Standard of moral Goodne&s;s, and Con&s;cience only a Deputy, and one too that is often mi&s;taken, Men &s;hould have Recour&s;e to the di|vine Law, and carefully examine, if God requires &s;uch Things. Unle&s;s you can produce &s;ome divine Law that requires you to do &s;o and &s;o, it is in vain for you to plead Con&s;cience: For where there is no Law, there is properly no Duty nor Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion. And if Con&s;cience forbids or commands an Action, where there is no divine Law, in this In&s;tance Con&s;cience abu|&s;es its Office, and the Man is not properly obliged, unle&s;s he can be &s;trictly and truly obliged to di&s;obey the holy Will of God, which is ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>Hence it appears that God has not laid you under Obliga|tions to follow your new Revelations and Impul&s;es, &s;ince you cannot prove by the proper Evidence of Miracles that they proceed from God. Your new Revelations and Impul&s;es are not the natural Dictates of Con&s;cience or a Part of the moral Law, which God has written on the Heart. For then the&s;e Revelations could not be called new, nor peculiar to you more

than others, but common to all Mankind. You cannot prove your Revelations to be the Will of God from Rea&s;on, nor from the Fitne&s;s of Things. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou cannot prove them to be immediate Revelations of the Will of God, becau&s;e they are de&s;ti|tute of his Seal of public Miracles. Now &s;ince your Revelations do not appear to be the Will of God, I hope your Con&s;ciences will find them&s;elves di&s;entangled from all imaginary Obliga|tions, and not urge you to follow them any more. Surely it is rea&s;onable that the&s;e imaginary Chains &s;hould be loo&s;ed. You may &s;ee you can be under no proper Obligations from Con|&s;cience to follow your new Revelations and Impul&s;es. It is weak and ridiculous to plead Con&s;cience for following your Impul&s;es, or for any Practice which you can't prove to be agreeable to the Will of God. If you plead Con&s;cience any more, then produce &s;ome Law of God that obliges you to practice as you do. But if you can produce no divine Precept, and yet continue in &s;uch unlawful Practices, you may plead Ignorance, you may plead Prejudice, you may plead Self-Will, you may plead &s;trong Imagination, or the Tran&s;ports of hot Zeal, or Pride; but you have no Right to plead Con&s;cience for your Practices, till you can produce the divine Law where God has required the&s;e Things at your Hands. <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"><P>Some very ingenious Philo&s;ophers &s;eem to have coined a new Name for Con&s;cience, calling it a Moral Sen&s;e.

The Honour of God, the Intere&s;t of the Re|deemer's Kingdom, the Welfare of your Country and your Po&s;terity, and even the Salvation of your own Souls will be greatly affected by your Conduct. Now when &s;uch important Intere&s;ts are at Stake, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me if I &s;peak plainly to you. When you have &s;eparated from us, you have &s;et up and followed &s;uch for Teachers among your&s;elves, as profe&s;&s;ed to be immediately called. This your immediate Call has been candidly examined in the preceeding Di&s;cour&s;e, and it has, I think been plainly and fully proved that you are fal&s;e Prophets and Teachers. Several of you have pretended to foretell future Things, which the Event has proved to be fal&s;e. Now if you hearken either to the Voice of Rea&s;on or to the Word of God, you mu&s;t be convinced that this is a full and clear Proof that you are fal&s;e Prophets. And tho' others may &s;ay, that they have not been thus detected, or that their Prophecies have never been proved fal&s;e by the Event; yet this will not excu&s;e them.

Now it has been proved in the foregoing Pages, that the&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions, if they come from God as you pretend, are as really Revelations as any that were made to in&s;pired Per&s;ons of old; and that &s;ome of them, &s;uch for In|&s;tance, as tho&s;e by which your Teachers pretend to be called to the Mini&s;try, are Revelations of new Truths, which are not contained in the Bible.

And therefore &s;ince you cannot work Miracles in Confirmation of your being &s;ent of him in an extraordinary Way, God requires us to account and treat you as deluded Per&s;ons, and your pre|tended in&s;pired Teachers as fal&s;e Prophets.

There never was a Sea&s;on in which more Per&s;ons pretended to In&s;piration, or to have Truths and Duties revealed to them by immediate Sugge&s;tions and Impul&s;es. And as no one of the&s;e Per&s;ons produces proper Credentials, or has the Seal of God to &s;hew; both Rea&s;on and Scripture allow, and indeed require us to look on them all as fal&s;e Prophets or Teachers. Yet it is &s;adly true that they have deceived many, leading them from the Word of God to follow their deluded Fancies. They have been unhappily &s;ucce&s;sful in filling the Minds of many well-meaning Per&s;ons with Pre|judices again&s;t the regular Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t. And what has been the Con&s;equence?

Is not a Want of Love to God, manife&s;ted by a general Luke-warmne&s;s and Indifference in Re|ligion, and by that &s;urpri&s;ing Neglect of the Wor&s;hip and Ordinances of God, &s;o ju&s;tly lamented by &s;erious Per&s;ons in all Parts of the Country?

<P>It requires only a calm and unprejudiced Examination to be convinced, that your Principles and Conduct have been in a very great Degree a Cau&s;e why Iniquity has abounded, and the Love of many waxen cold among us.

that can never be defended, many of them being really ab&s;urd and ridiculous. You teach Per&s;ons to place Religion in Things that can never be received by a rational Mind. You are unwearied in your Endeavours to de&s;troy the Influence of the &s;tanding Mini&s;ters repre&s;enting them as carnal, blind and dead, as Hirelings and Mini&s;ters of Antichir&s;t. And the Con|&s;equence has been that many unthinking Per&s;ons are carele&s;s about or prejudiced again&s;t all Religion, and it is to be feared will turn open Infidels. You with the greate&s;t Confidence pronounce this Man converted, and that Man immediately called of God to the Mini&s;try; when all your under&s;tanding Neighbours plainly &s;ee, that the former wants the Scripture Marks of Conver&s;ion, and perhaps is further from the Charac|ter of a good Man than he was before; and that the latter is de&s;titute of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Qualifications of a Go&s;pel-Mi|ni&s;ter. And there have been In&s;tances, as you very well know, wherein both the Convert and the Mini&s;ter, concerning whom you have pronounced with the greate&s;t A&s;&s;urance, have after all turned out to be Men of immoral and abandoned Charac|ters. The&s;e and &s;uch like Things have wounded Religion, and are continually wounding it in an awful Manner. On the whole, it may be ju&s;tly doubted, whether you could have done &s;o much Hurt to Religion, if you had been open and profe&s;&s;ed Enemies to it, as you have done under the Profe&s;&s;ion of the highe&s;t Friend&s;hip to it, and a Cloak of the mo&s;t flaming Zeal. If you are unprejudiced enough to feel the Force of my Rea&s;oning, yet methinks a View of the pre&s;ent State of Religion in the Country, joined with the Con&s;ideration that it is plainly fore|told in the Scriptures, that when fal&s;e Prophets and Teachers &s;hould ri&s;e and deceive many, Iniquity &s;hould abound, the Love of many wax cold, and the Ways of Truth be evil &s;poken of, mu&s;t at lea&s;t abate your Confidence, and rai&s;e &s;ome Su&s;picion in your Minds whether you are not mi&s;taken, and whether your Conduct does not de&s;troy in&s;tead of promoting Religion.</P>

either out of Curio&s;ity, or on Account of their being near their Habitations, while they don't profe&s;s to join with you, will con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly what has been &s;aid. I know &s;ome of you have &s;undry Things to &s;ay in your own Vindication. And &s;ince my chief Hopes of Succe&s;s are among you, I &s;hall conculde this Addre&s;s by an&s;wering your Arguments, and giving my Rea&s;ons again&s;t your Practice.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Some of you are ready to plead that the&s;e Sects hold a great many good Things, and their Exhorters &s;ay &s;ome good Things. And why may not you go and hear them? Why need Mini&s;ters &s;ay any Thing again&s;t them?</P>
<P>ANSWER. Don't you think that the Papi&s;ts, Jews, Maho|metans, and Dei&s;ts, hold many good Things? When we di&s;|pute again&s;t them, it is not again&s;t the good Things which they hold in common with us, but again&s;t their Errors. The Que&s;ti|on is, whether tho&s;e Things wherein they differ from us are good? Whether con&s;idering them as Papi&s;ts, Jews, Mahometans, and Dei&s;ts, they are right; to be countenanced and followed. And thus it is with Re&s;pect to the&s;e &s;everal Sects I have been oppo&s;ing. There is no Doubt but they hold &s;ome good Things, I wi&s;h they held more. I have no Controver&s;y with them about the Truths they believe, but about their Errors. Now the Que&s;tion is whether they are right in tho&s;e Peculiarities wherein they differ from the &s;tanding Churches? For the&s;e are the Things that denominate them to belong to &s;ome or other of the&s;e Sects. I have plainly declared my Sentiments, that they are entirely wrong in their Peculiarites, and I can't but believe you mu&s;t be of my Mind if you peru&s;e this Addre&s;s with &s;ufficient Care and Candour. If you think they are right in their di&s;tingui&s;hing Tenets, why don't you join them? And if you cannot prove they are right in their peculiar Notions, your pleading they are right in tho&s;e Things which they hold in common with us is really Nothing at all to your Purpo&s;e. There never was any Sect of Hereticks &s;o corrupt as to deny all Truths, &s;o that by this Rule Mini&s;ters &s;hould never try to reclaim Per&s;ons from their Mi&s;takes, and con&s;equently the Apo&s;tles did very wrong in reproving and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iting again&s;t the fal&s;e Teachers that di&s;turbed the Churches in their Days.</P>
<P N="2">2d. But you have a more plau&s;ible Argument. You &s;ay, when you look <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound on the &s;tanding Churches and their Mem|bers,
<PB N="191" REF="009120_0105_1030F364D93BABC8">
you can &s;carcely &s;ee any Appearance of Religion. A dull Formality prevails in attending publick Wor&s;hip, and at other Times much Vanity, Frothine&s;s, yea and much open Profanene&s;s. The Youth are light, airy, carele&s;s and irreli|gious; the aged worldly, luke-warm and indifferent about &s;eri|ous Piety. Whereas when you look among the &s;eparate Meet|ings, and tho&s;e that attend them, you &s;ee much Solemnity and Seriou&s;ne&s;s. In &s;hort you &s;ay there is a much greater Appear|ance of Religion among them than in the &s;tanding Churches.</P>
<P>ANSWER. As I have already con&s;idered the extraordinary reli|gious Appearances which are among them, and I think fully proved that they are no good Proof that they are right, I &s;hall not here repeat what I have &s;aid, but &s;eriou&s;ly entreat you to review tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages again. There is doubtle&s;s great Rea&s;on to la|ment over the prevailing Iniquities of the Times, and the Wicked|ne&s;s of many that belong to the &s;tanding Churches. But &s;ince tho&s;e who have &s;eparated from us have had a principal Hand by their di&s;orderly Practices to provoke God to withdraw his Spirit, to rai&s;e and foment Pejudices in the Minds of People again&s;t their Mini&s;ters, and thus to promote the Wickedne&s;s &s;o much lamented among us, I can't but think, that when they upbraid us with the&s;e Things they mu&s;t do it with a peculiar ill Grace.</P>
<P>This is an Objection which was made of old again&s;t Chri&s;t and his true followers. <Q>The Di&s;ciples of John and of the Phari&s;ees u&s;ed to fa&s;t, and they came and &s;aid unto Chri&s;t, why do the Di&s;ciples of John, and of the Phari&s;ees fa&s;t, but thy Di&s;ciples fa&s;t not?</Q> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Mark ii, 18.</NOTE> They were it &s;eems greatly &s;tumbled, and much at a Lo&s;s about Chri&s;t and his Di&s;ciples, becau&s;e (as they thought) they did not appear to be &s;o &s;trict and religious, as the Di&s;ciples of John and of the Phari&s;ees. It is abundantly evident from the New-Te&s;tament that the Phari&s;ees were very &s;trict and devout in their Way. They were frequent in their religious Exerci&s;es, &s;ince they fa&s;ted twice in the Week. The Mahometans are very frequent in their Devotions, and they value them&s;elves on being more &s;trict and virtuous, than they think Chri&s;tians are. Hence it is reported to be a common &s;aying among them, <Q>would you have me to &s;wear and lie like a Chri&s;tian.</Q> If we come to Chri&s;tendom, have not the Papi&s;ts a much greater &s;how of Re|ligion than the Prote&s;tants? Where can you find any Man &s;o
<PB N="192" REF="009120_0106_1030F369474B0120">
&s;trict and devout in his Way as the famous Abbe <HI>de Paris?</HI> And there are great Numbers who profe&s;s the Romi&s;h Religion, who are eminent for extraordinary Fa&s;tings, Penances and De|votions, far beyond what prevails among Prote&s;tants. And I have been credibly informed that Popery &s;preads and gains Ground among the common People in &s;ome Places in En|gland, on this very Account, that the Papi&s;ts are more fre|quent and devout in their religious Exerci&s;es. Suppo&s;e you had been carried Captive to <HI>Canada</HI> in the begining of the War, and had &s;een the Papi&s;ts frequent, engaged and lively in their religious Wor&s;hip, as they are &s;aid to have been if I remember right, and then upon an Exchange of Pri&s;oners, when you came into the Engli&s;h Army, you &s;hould have perceived &s;carcely any Appearance of Religion, but the general Part Cur&s;ing and Swearing, what would you have done? According to your Objection you mu&s;t have been ready to change your Reli|gion, and become Papi&s;ts, at lea&s;t you mu&s;t have been greatly at a Lo&s;s, whether they were not after all in the right. Thus your Argument concludes as &s;trongly in Favour of the Phari&s;ees, Mahometans, and Papi&s;ts, as it does in Favour of tho&s;e who have &s;eparated from our Churches. Yet I dare &s;ay you have no Tho'ts of profe&s;&s;ing your&s;elves Pha|ri&s;ees, Papi&s;ts, or Mahometans. Your Argument proves too much, if it could prove any Thing, and therefore it mu&s;t pro|ceed upon a Mi&s;take. The Mi&s;take in this Re&s;pect is your making the external Shew of Religion a certain Mark, and Evidence of Per&s;on's being right. Now you might have known from the common Proverb, "all is not Gold that gli&s;ters" that &s;ome profe&s;s a great deal of Religion, who have no more of it in Reality, than their Neighbours. Was not this the Ca&s;e with the Phari&s;ees, the Mahometans and Papi&s;ts? As I don't pretend to &s;earch the Hearts, nor to know how far God may permit Saints to be deluded by Satan, as David was when he was influenced by this proud Spirit to number the People, as Peter was who thro' his In&s;tigation denied his Lord and Ma&s;ter; &s;o I cannot tell how many of tho&s;e who thro' his Delu&s;ions have &s;eparated from us, are &s;incerely religious. But be that as it may, I am &s;ure they are wrong in yielding to his Delu&s;ions, and I am &s;ure you would be very wrong in follow|ing them. I cannot think that their following their own erro|neous
<PB N="193" REF="009120_0106_1030F369474B0120">
and heated Imaginations, and the Delu&s;ions of Satan, is any great Sign of eminent Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>As it is natural for &s;urper&s;titious and deluded Devotees to appear more religious than they really are, and to make a great Shew of external Piety, when they are utter Strangers to it; I have often wondered that tho&s;e who have &s;eparated from the &s;tanding Churches have not been more eminent for their vi&s;i|ble Purity and Holine&s;s than they generally are at pre&s;ent. They withdrew from us, becau&s;e they imagined our Churches were not pure. They were a &s;elect Company of true Converts as they them&s;elves gave out. And yet if we make the Go&s;pel our Rule by which to judge of Purity, I believe they don't &s;hine very bright.&mdash;As our Churches contain in &s;ome Sen&s;e the general Part of tho&s;e that are born and brought up in the Land, and there's a &s;mall Company who all profe&s;&s;ed to be true Converts, it would not have been wonderful, if their Members had greatly out&s;hined ours, con&s;idered as a Body. For they pretended to the greate&s;t Purity, and their Character and Credit as a Party depended very much on making good their Preten&s;ions. Now Pride will excite Men to do a great Deal in Religion, when their Credit of Intere&s;t lies at Stake. How many brave Things did Jehu do? Yet notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e powerful Motives and peculiar Advantages which they have had, I believe if you candidly con&s;ider their Members and ours, and the &s;everal violent Heats and unchri&s;tian Contenti|ons that have ari&s;en among them, at one Time and another, &amp;c. you mu&s;t acknowledge they have very little to boa&s;t of, even in Point of vi&s;ible Purity. According to my Ob&s;erva|tion, and the Account I have received from &s;everal worthy Gentlemen that are acquainted with them, there have been as many Scandals among them for their Number, and the Time they have &s;eparated, as in the &s;tanding Churches. And I believe they have &s;hewed as little Zeal and Faithfulne&s;s in cen&s;uring Offenders as any Church in the Land. If they were to be tried by the Standard of Purity before impartial Judges, they would probably be found to be no Gainers by their Sepa|ration. And if we remember that it has been proved, that many of tho&s;e Things which they call the eminent Exerci&s;es of Religion proceed from un&s;criptural Notions, and wild Ima|ginations or the Sugge&s;tions of Satan; the Advantage in Point
<PB N="194" REF="009120_0107_1030F36FA0453330">
of true Religion, &s;incere Chri&s;tian Piety, is almo&s;t beyond Compari&s;on on the Side of the &s;tanding Churches. For &s;trip their Religion of Extravagancies, and what have they left be|hind? They have the out&s;ide Shew of Religion, but where is there any Thing among them like internal Holine&s;s and real Humblene&s;s of Heart? Where is their Meekne&s;s? Where their Charity? Now according to the Apo&s;tle, It a Man &s;hould &s;peak with the Tongues of Men, and of Angels, and have not Charity, he is become as a &s;ounding Bra&s;s and a tinkling Cym|bal: Though he had the <HI>Gift</HI> of Prophecy, and under&s;tood all My&s;teries&mdash;and have no Charity, he is Nothing; yea, tho' he &s;hould be &s;o zealous as to give his Body to be burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth him Nothing.</P>
<P>But I don't de&s;ire to pu&s;h this Point too far. As I have al|ready hinted, the Practi&s;es of tho&s;e who profe&s;s any certain Re|ligion &s;hould not be made the grand Mark or Evidence by which we &s;hould judge of its Truth or Fal&s;hood. There have been very excellent Per&s;ons who have &s;eemed to differ greatly in their religious Sentiments about various Things. Some wicked Per&s;ons have belonged to the be&s;t and pure&s;t Churches, as Simon Magus to that of the Apo&s;tles. When we examine whether &s;uch a religious Denomination be right, the proper Que&s;tions to be di&s;cu&s;ed are, what do they believe? what are their peculiar Tenets and di&s;tingui&s;hing Prin|ciples? If we find the&s;e to be agreeable to the Word of God, we mu&s;t pronounce them right, let the Profe&s;&s;ors of that Re|ligion live as they will. If their Practice is bad, this does not prove that the Religion which they profe&s;s is bad, when by the Suppo&s;ition it is agreeable to the holy Scriptures, but that they practi&s;e contrary to their Good Principles. Thus tho' many profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians in St. Paul's Time appeared by their wicked Practices to be Enemies of the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, this was no good Argument to prove that the Chri&s;tian Religion was bad. The Go&s;pel was not the Wor&s;e for their wicked Prac|tices, &s;ince it did not countenance them in their Wickedne&s;s, but bore an open Te&s;timony again&s;t all Sorts of Iniquity. And thus the &s;tanding Churches are not to be blamed for the Luke-warmne&s;s, the Irreligion and Profanene&s;s, which alas! too much prevail among many in the pre&s;ent Day; for we don't approve of their Luke-warmne&s;s and Wickedne&s;s. With the

little like Religion; than the regular &s;tanding Churches who&s;e Principles are known to be founded on the Scriptures, &s;ince there are &s;ome Luke-warm Profe&s;&s;ors and vicious Per|&s;ons belonging to them, whom they greatly di&s;approve and faithfully exhort to for&s;ake their wicked Cour&s;es?</Q> When your Objection is thus fairly &s;tated, I hope you can &s;ee that it is not very weighty.

<P N="3">3d. But why does God own tho&s;e who have &s;eparated from us if they were &s;o very wrong?</P>
<P>ANSWER. How do you know that he does own them? God may over-rule a Temptation of Satan, or a Per&s;on's falling into a grevious Sin to be a Means of &s;aving Good to his Soul. But would you run into Sin, or the Temptations of Satan in Expecta|tion of receiving this &s;aving Good? You &s;hould remember what I have already ob&s;erved, that when we &s;peak of any reli|gious Sect of People, we always refer to their peculiar di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Principles. Now you have no Rea&s;on to think that God ever improved any of the peculiar Principles of the&s;e Sects to do any Good to one Soul, otherwi&s;e than he might over|rule the Temptations of the Evil Spirit. Whereas on the con|trary, you have the mo&s;t &s;olid Rea&s;ons to convince you that God has frequently ble&s;&s;ed the Doctrines of the &s;tanding Mi|ni&s;ters and Churches for the &s;aving Benefit of the Souls of his People. Do you con&s;ider what you &s;ay, when you talk about God's owning the&s;e &s;eparate Teachers and A&s;&s;emblies? Do you, can you, &s;oberly think that God approves of Errors and wild Di&s;orders? And is it not certain that the&s;e are their Peculiari|ties? If they are not owned in the&s;e Things, they are not owned at all. Suppo&s;e then it were certain that God ble&s;&s;ed &s;ome Truths which they chance &s;ometimes to deliver for the Benefit of &s;ome Per&s;ons, this is not to be looked on as his own|ing of them, &s;ince this is only his ble&s;&s;ing his own Truth and not an Approbation of their Errors. And thus it &s;eems he ble&s;&s;ed his Truths in Paul's Time tho' delivered by Men who preached Chri&s;t out of Envy.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="009120_0108_1030F371373FB8F8">And now having heard and con&s;idered the chief Things you have to &s;ay in Defence of your Practice, in encouraging the&s;e Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and their Teachers by frequenting their Meet|ings, I hope you'll patiently attend a little longer, while I of|fer my Rea&s;ons again&s;t it.</P>
<P>It is repre&s;ented in the Word of God as a Sinful Thing to continue fickle and un&s;ettled in your Sentiments about Religion. Mo&s;t certainly Religion is a Matter of &s;uch Importance, as &s;hould engage your mo&s;t &s;erious Attention. You &s;hould care|fully examine what is right, and adhere to it with Stedfa&s;tne&s;s. Hence the I&s;ralites of old were blamed for halting between two Opinions. The Apo&s;tle Paul repre&s;ents it as a childi&s;h Thing for Chri&s;tians to continue wavering and un&s;ettled a|bout Religion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er that Chri&s;t has granted us &s;uch great Advan|tages under the Go&s;pel. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Eph iv 14 2 Tim. iii 6 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. &amp;c.</NOTE> <Q>That we henceforth be no more Children to&s;&s;ed to and fro with every Wind of Doctrine by the Slight of Men and cunning Craftine&s;s whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</Q> And in another Pa&s;&s;age he &s;peaks of them as <Q>&s;illy Women who are ever learning and never able to come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</Q> You &s;ee accord|ing to the Apo&s;tle Paul, that Per&s;ons, who have no fixed Prin|ciples in Religion, but who are ready to follow every one, who &s;ays, Lo here is Chri&s;t, or Lo there, &s;eem to be childi&s;h and &s;illy. Mu&s;t not your wavering between one Opinion and ano|ther ari&s;e from this Sort of Childi&s;hne&s;s and Silline&s;s; or from &s;uch an Indifferency to all Religion, that you don't think it worth while to examine it at all. I can't but be afraid this is the Ca&s;e with &s;ome of you, tho' I hope better of others. But be that as it may, certainly you don't repre&s;ent your&s;elves in a good Light, who having grown up in a Chri&s;tian Land, and un|der the mo&s;t excellent, religious Advantages, and yet are &s;o ignorant or un&s;table, that you are ready at every Turn to re|nounce your profe&s;&s;ed Principles, and become the Pro&s;elytes of every enthu&s;ia&s;tic Sect, and &s;eparate Party.</P>
<P>How many of tho&s;e who have &s;eparated from us, &s;olemnly promi&s;ed before God, Angels and Men, that they would &s;incere|ly adhere to the holy Scriptures, and &s;eek the Peace and Pro&s;pe|rity of our Churches. Yet you &s;ee they have rent them&s;elves off from us, and u&s;e all their little Arts and Cunning to ruin

and de&s;troy us. Now what can be done with Per&s;ons, who from Impul&s;es or Prejudices, or both, thus openly break their &s;olemn Promi&s;es and Covenant Engagements? God commands, and they promi&s;ed to &s;eek and maintain Peace. And yet they u&s;e their utmo&s;t Endeavours to promote Divi&s;ion, Strife and Con|tention, as if they had determined to act in the mo&s;t open De|fiance of their &s;olemn Vows and Promi&s;es as well as of the Go&s;|pel. Had we impo&s;ed any un&s;criptural Terms of Communion on them, this would have made us the Breakers of the Covenant Contract, and afforded them a good Plea for Separation, if they had patiently endured and tried to make us &s;en&s;ible of our Er|rors. But we have remained true and &s;tedfa&s;t to our Covenant, adhering &s;trictly to the Word of God, teaching tho&s;e Things, and tho&s;e only which Chri&s;t has commanded in his written Word. And thus it clearly appears, they have &s;eparated from the &s;tanding Churches for the Sake of their own beloved Errors, their Impul&s;es, Revelations, &amp;c. Now when you attend on their Meetings Time after Time, don't you encourage them to go on in the&s;e their Errors, which are of &s;uch a dangerous Ten|dency to the Souls of Men; which threaten to &s;ubvert the Scriptures, and root out all &s;incere experimental Religion. Do you think this is acting a friendly Part to them, or to the &s;tand|ing Churches, or to your&s;elves.</P>
<P>It &s;eems by your Conduct, you can hear them reproach, vi|lify and contemn all the Churches and Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t in the Land, as Limbs of Anti-Chri&s;t, and Synagogues of Satan, without any Appearance of Di&s;&s;atisfaction; nay, with &s;eeming Approbation. For why el&s;e do you attend their Meetings? And yet a&s;toni&s;hing! &s;undry of you would take it hard to be excluded from chri&s;tian Privileges in our Churches. Is not this &s;trange and incon&s;i&s;tent Conduct? When you review it &s;oberly&punc; can you po&s;&s;ibly believe that Chri&s;t the great King and Head of the Church approves of your Practice? Has he left you at Li|berty to countenance Enthu&s;ia&s;ts in their Errors, and confirm them in their awful Delu&s;ions and Evil-Speekings; and to weaken the Hands of tho&s;e who upon your own Principles are his true Mi|ni&s;ters and Churches?

That they are not thus &s;ent of God has been fully proved already; and you your|&s;elves &s;eem to allow it, &s;ince you don't profe&s;s to join with them as compleat Members.

<P>As this your Conduct is &s;inful, offen&s;ive to God, and hurtful to Religion, you have awful Rea&s;on to fear, le&s;t God in his righteous Judgment &s;hould give you over to &s;trong Delu&s;ions, and leave you fully to join with them in the wor&s;t of their Ex|travagancies in Principle and Practice; even to go to that hor|rid Length to which John Lewis and the Dutartres were car|ried of Satan. 'Tis often ob&s;erved, that when a new Sect of En|thu&s;ia&s;ts ari&s;es, many follow them, and attend their Meetings; &s;ome out of Curio&s;ity, and &s;ome perhaps to divert them&s;elves with their Extravagance and Non&s;en&s;e. After a while &s;ome will attend becau&s;e the Place of their Meeting is nearer them, than that to which they belong, or becau&s;e they are di&s;affected to the Mini&s;ter or &s;ome of the Church; and &s;ome of the&s;e Per&s;ons at length go fully into tho&s;e Principles and Practices, which they at fir&s;t abhorred.

<P>As the Separati&s;ts, when they hear any Story that reflects Di&s;grace upon our Churches, e&s;pecially on the Mini&s;ters, we from long Experience don't expect they will take any &s;uitable Pains to enquire whether it be true or fal&s;e; but that they will rather employ all the Strength of their gloomy Imagination in exaggerating it, till it becomes quite frightful; and then deal by it as the Levite did with his Concubine, cut it into Pieces and &s;end to all the Coa&s;ts of I&s;rael to rai&s;e the popular Odium. And what is yet wor&s;e, if they can find Nothing of a public Nature &s;ufficient to ruin a Mini&s;ter's Character and U&s;efulne&s;s, they will give broad Hints and frequently, expre&s;sly affirm that he is unconverted, or at be&s;t fallen from God and become dead. And it is to be greatly lamented that this &s;ame an&s;avou|ry Leaven has deeply infected many of the &s;tanding Churches. Sundry great Profe&s;&s;ors, if we may judge from their Practice, &s;eem to imagine that a con&s;iderable Part of Religion con&s;i&s;ts in decrying Mini&s;ters. To hear them di&s;cour&s;e on this darling Topic, one would think the pre&s;ent Set of Mini&s;ters in this Country were a Parcel of &s;illy Ideots or de&s;igning Knaves, or that the Declaimers were Pupils of Shaft&s;bury or Bolingbrook.</P>

And as to you who have not withdrawn from our Churches, but attend the Ordinances we admini&s;ter, you mu&s;t at lea&s;t allow me to plead in Behalf of Mini&s;ters the common Privilege of Brethren. It is the &s;econd Command of Chri&s;t to love your Neighbours and Brethren as your&s;elves.

But if in&s;tead of loving us as your&s;elves, you indulge unchri&s;tian Jealou&s;ies and Su&s;picions, and endea|vour to weaken our Influence and ruin our Characters by dark Innuendoes, you mu&s;t permit me to a&s;k you, whether this be not comprehended in Scripture in the Words <HI>Backbiting</HI> and <HI>&s;miling &s;ecretly.</HI> And if it is, you would do well to remember, that God has &s;aid, <Q>Cur&s;ed be he that &s;miteth his Neighbour &s;ecretly, and all the People &s;hall &s;ay, Amen.</Q> Let Men then take Heed to them&s;elves, le&s;t while they are &s;ecretly judg|ing and &s;miting others they &s;hould be condemned them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Separati&s;ts of one Kind and another commonly buzz it into People's Ears where they think they are likely to have any Influence, that all, who join in communion with a Church in which there are any Per&s;ons guilty of &s;candalous Sins, erro|neous Opinions, or chargeable with Back&s;liding and Luke-warmne&s;s, are as wicked as the Per&s;ons them&s;elves who have actually fallen into &s;uch Sins. And as it cannot he denied that there are &s;undry Per&s;ons in the &s;tanding Churches, whom we have Rea&s;on to mourn over with the Apo&s;tle 2 Cor. xii. 20, 21. this is a Topic which affords them Matter for many zealous and bitter Declamations, which have a Tendency to alarm the Con&s;ciences of weak Per&s;ons. Yet this Principle is a very ignorant and wild Conceit.</P>
<P>The Means of Grace and the Ordinances of the Go&s;pel were not appointed for &s;incere Believers as &s;uch, but for the vi&s;ible Church, for vi&s;ible Believers and their Seed. Thus Mo&s;es in&s;tructed. Thus I&s;rael under&s;tood and practi&s;ed. Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles preached to the unconverted, and commanded them to <Q>take Heed how they heard and to repent and be|lieve.</Q> When the Apo&s;tle Peter looked on Simon Magus to be unconverted he directed him to pray&mdash;The Ordinances of the Go&s;pel were not in&s;tituted nor de&s;igned to te&s;tify that we be|lieve that all with whom we join are &s;incere Saints, nor that we approve their Conduct, but they were appointed to repre&s;ent Chri&s;t and his Benefits. This is their principal End. With Re&s;pect to our Brethren with whom we join in Communion, we te&s;tify by our Conduct, that &s;o far as we have any certain Knowledge about their Practice, all Things con&s;idered as Mat|ters are circum&s;tanced, we may lawfully join in Communion
<PB N="203" REF="009120_0111_1030F375F3F71DA8">
with them. And though they &s;hould be guilty of many Sins, yet we are not in any Sen&s;e chargeable with them, if we have carefully followed what appeared to us to be the Mind of Chri&s;t in reproving, di&s;ciplining, and te&s;tifying again&s;t their erroneous Opinions and &s;inful Practices; all which we may do according to the Rules of the Go&s;pel, without any Separa|tion from the Church to which they belong. Unle&s;s this be allowed it will follow that the Prophets and Apo&s;tles were defiled by holding Communion with the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian Churches. For there were many erroneous, di&s;orderly, back|&s;liding and lukewarm Per&s;ons in both the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian Churches in their Days, as well as now. Yea, more &s;hock|ing, Chri&s;t him&s;elf the Holy One of God mu&s;t have been pol|luted by his joining in Communion with the Jewi&s;h Church, and chargeable with all the &s;candalous and abominable Sins of that People, who were the greate&s;t Part of them open Sinners or &s;ecret Hypocrites. For he punctually attended their religi|ous Wor&s;hip and Fea&s;ts at Jeru&s;alem. He never &s;eparated from their Communion. But he u&s;ed all lawful Means to re|claim them, and bore due Te&s;timony again&s;t their fal&s;e Doc|trines and wicked Practices. In following his Example we are &s;afe. In for&s;aking it there is Danger.</P>
<P>Do we hinder you to follow any of the Methods which God has pre&s;cribed to you in his Word in reproving any &s;candalous Offender in our Churches, or in tabling a Complaint again&s;t him, or in bearing Te&s;timony again&s;t every Thing that is wrong in a chri&s;tian Manner?</P>
<P>As to the Scriptures which the various Kinds of Separati&s;ts from true Churches quote to ju&s;tify them in their Separations having been &s;o lengthy already I have not Room at pre&s;ent to examine them particularly. Nor is there any great Need&mdash; God erected his vi&s;ible Church among the Jews, and at length cho&s;e Jeru&s;alem for the chief Seat of his public Wor&s;hip to which he commanded them all to repair. This Church he maintained and erected no other till after the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t. Hence it is certain, there can be no Precept, nor any Example that God approved of to ju&s;tify Separation from the Jewi&s;h Church, or any true Church during this Period. The Old-Te&s;tament and the four Go&s;pels, can be Nothing to the Purpo&s;e of the Separati&s;ts. Yet there were many Separa|ti&s;ts
<PB N="204" REF="009120_0112_1030F37E850C7330">
during this Period. King Jeroboam withdrew from the Jewi&s;h Church, and &s;et up two Separate Meetings, one at Dan and another at Bethel, and many induced partly by his Authority, and partly by their own Inclination, followed his Example. But he and they &s;tand on Record in the Scriptures &s;tigmatized as wicked Schi&s;maticks to all Generations. The Samaritans &s;et up another Separate Meeting at Mount Geriz|zim: But our ble&s;&s;ed Lord expre&s;sly condemned them as Schi&s;|maticks, and as wor&s;hipping they knew not what.</P>
<P>We find as little to countenance Separations from a true Church where no un&s;criptural Terms of Communion are im|po&s;ed, in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles and their other Writings as in the preceding Part of the Bible. It appears from their Writ|ings that there were many Di&s;orders, Corruptions and Back|&s;lidings in the primitive Churches before the Apo&s;tles died. An Antichri&s;tian Spirit had even then begun to work. Yet not|with&s;tanding the&s;e Things they were &s;till true Churches of Chri&s;t, and owned by him as &s;uch. He had not for&s;aken them, but held their Stars in his right Hand, and walked in the mid&s;t of the Golden Candle&s;ticks. And &s;ince this was the Ca&s;e, can any Man be &s;o weak as once to imagine, that he allowed or required any of his People to &s;eparate from the Communion of tho&s;e Churches. Hence it is plain that they mu&s;t pervert all and every Tex of Scripture which they quote to ju&s;tify Separations from the regular &s;tanding Churches in the Country; &s;ince &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages are only Exhortations to Chri&s;tians to keep them&s;elves from the Sins and Corruptions that prevail in their Day, and not to countenance others in their Errors and wicked Practices, all which may be done without withdrawing from their Communion; or at mo&s;t to &s;eparate from tho&s;e Churches where there are new and un&s;criptural Term of Communion impo&s;ed and all other Methods of obtaining Redre&s;s prove un&s;ucce&s;sful. In &s;uch a Ca&s;e it is readily acknowledged that Chri&s;t has commanded his Di&s;ciples to <Q>&s;tand fa&s;t in the Liberty wherewith he has made us free,</Q> and he ju&s;tified his Di&s;ciples in di&s;regarding the Rites, Ceremonies, Inventions and Traditions of the Phari&s;ees and Elders. And then the ri|gorous Impo&s;ers are the blameable Schi&s;maticks. A major Party in a Church may act incon&s;i&s;tent with the Principles of Liberty and play the Tyrant. And if they do, and thus
<PB N="205" REF="009120_0112_1030F37E850C7330">
compel the Minor to withdraw by their un&s;criptural Impo&s;iti|ons and Tyranny, the Sin and Guilt of the Schi&s;m will lie at their Door. However a Minor Party &s;hould not be ra&s;h in withdrawing and &s;etting up another Church. It is agreeable to the Scriptures and the Example of the Apo&s;tles, Acts xv. to &s;ubmit the Matter in Conte&s;t to the Deci&s;ion of proper and Impartial Judges. This valuable Privilege and important Branch of Chri&s;tian Liberty is &s;ecured to our Churches by our excellent Con&s;titution as well as granted in the New-Te&s;ta|ment. But it is incompatible with that Sort of Government or rather Anarchy, that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily prevail in the indepen|dent &s;eparate A&s;&s;emblies. Hence their various Confu&s;ions, Contentions, and &s;ometimes Excommunications of one another, and Separations from Separations.

This Sin and Guilt would doubtle&s;s be dreadful, though the Separations proceed from merely a proud, ambitious and contentious Spirit. But certainly it mu&s;t great|ly aggravate the Guilt and Puni&s;hment, if &s;uch Per&s;ons be|&s;ides Pride and Ambition are al&s;o influenced by a Love to de|&s;tructive Errors. In &s;uch a Ca&s;e they mu&s;t in an awful Man|ner be laying Stumbling Blocks in the Way of the blind, and hardening Sinners in their wicked Ways, to their eternal Ruin.

<P>The Fal&s;hood and bad Tendency of their Principle about immediate Impul&s;es, Revelations, &amp;c. which is the great Foun|dation, the Life and Soul of all their Schemes, has been clearly demon&s;trated.

And does not Pre&s;umption and Stupidity, the natural Con&s;equences of &s;uch Notions, greatly prevail in the pre&s;ent Day?

And has not Profanation of the Sabbath been growing more fa&s;hinonable for &s;ome Years? Others <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Separate Bapti&s;ts.</NOTE> of them declaim again&s;t Infant Bapti&s;m, and repre&s;ent it as a Thing utterly in&s;ignificant and u&s;ele&s;s. And don't many &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;o far in|fluenced by their noi&s;y Clamours as to forget their bapti&s;mal Vows? They zealou&s;ly maintain that the vi&s;ible Church mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t only of &s;incere Saints, and that God does not require, but forbid unconverted Sinners to attempt the performance of any religious Duty, and that it is one of the greate&s;t Sins, if not the unpardonable Sin for any who are not &s;incere Believers to attend the Sacraments. Hence when a Man has attemp|ted
<PB N="207" REF="009120_0113_1030F38017BC7638">
to pray whom they looked on to be unconverted, &s;undry of them have been known immediately to withdraw, probably le&s;t they &s;hould countenance him in &s;uch a &s;inful Practice.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence which naturally follows from &s;uch Prici|ples is that unconverted Sinners &s;hould not regard Religion at all, but live as they plea&s;e. For if they may not lawfully attempt to perform religious Duties, and wait upon God for his Grace in the be&s;t Manner they can; if it be really &s;o, that God has ab&s;olutely forbidden them to read, hear, pray, medi|tate, attend Sacraments, &amp;c. without the highe&s;t Kind of Faith; then they mu&s;t fir&s;t know they are converted and have this &s;aving Faith. Otherwi&s;e they will do what according to this Scheme God has not directed nor required, which would be Pre&s;umption. Dreadful is the Cur&s;e which God has de|nounced again&s;t tho&s;e who make any Additions to his written Word, and do what he has not commanded.&mdash;On this Scheme there can be no public Wor&s;hip nor Sacraments at|tended at all. For there are not a &s;ufficient number of a&s;&s;ured Chri&s;tians ordinarily living &s;o contigous as would an&s;wer for this End.</P>
<P>They will allow perhaps when pinched with an Argument that unconverted Sinners are under Obligations to &s;erve God by vertue of his Law. But if they would be con&s;i&s;tent with them|&s;elves, they mu&s;t own that unconverted Sinners are obliged on|ly as the Devils are. But the Law which God has revealed to Mankind in his Word is the Law of Chri&s;t. It is ordained in the Hand of a Mediator. And Men had perhaps as good neg|lect Duties altogether as perform them without any Reference to Chri&s;t the Mediator. If any &s;hould think the Devils are bound to pray to God, yet &s;urely they can't imagine they are bound to pray to him in the Name of Chri&s;t which is the Way which God has pre&s;cribed to Mankind in his Word.

<P>Some endeavour to &s;upport them&s;elves in their Errors and others in their Sins from the Doctrine of Prede&s;tination, &s;aying if they are elected they &s;hall be &s;aved, let them be ever &s;o wicked. But &s;uch &s;hould remember that the Scripture Account is <Q>Elect according to the Fore-knowledge of God the Father, through Sanctification of the Spirit unto Obedience and Sprinkling of the Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> The Means and

the Way are as much appointed as the End. And to allude to the Words of Chri&s;t in another Ca&s;e, "what God hath joined together, let not Man put a&s;under."</P>
<P>Some Ignorant Per&s;ons infer with John Lewis, that if the Doctrine of Prede&s;tination be true, then Moral Agency is de|&s;troyed, and they &s;o compelled to act, that they are not to blame for their Sins. But did they never read, that tho' it was determined or decreed in the Scripture Sen&s;e of the&s;e Words, that Judas &s;hould betray his Lord and Ma&s;ter; yet this did not free him from Blame, nor deliver him from a mo&s;t aggravated Puni&s;hment? <Q>The Son of Man goeth as it was determined, but Wo unto that Man by whom he is betrayed, It had been good for that Man if he had not been born</Q> This plain Text mentions a certain Matter of Fact. Let tho&s;e who di&s;like the 17th of the famous 39 Arti|cles, explain this Text and Fact fairly at their Lei&s;ure. Let Men's Con&s;ciences be thoroughly awakened, and they will find with John Lewis, that &s;uch Refuge will fail them. They will then &s;ee, that as the Decrees of God were &s;ecret and un|known to them, &s;o they never indulged their &s;inful Lu&s;ts with any View to fulfil them: and con&s;equently that it is utterly vain to attempt to throw the Blame of their Sins on the wi&s;e, ju&s;t and holy Decrees of the ble&s;&s;ed God.</P>
<P>God has made the reprobate as well as his Elect. The Non-Elect are his Subjects as well as the Elect. The Com|mands of God which are the Rule of Conduct are given to both without Di&s;tinction. And all are bound to obey them. So that it is contrary to all the Commands of God to &s;uppo&s;e that Men &s;hould not attempt to &s;erve God till they know they have the Faith of God's Elect.</P>
<P>The Means of Grace and the Ordinances of the Go&s;pel, are not given to the Elect as &s;uch, becau&s;e they live promi&s;cuou&s;ly among the Non-Elect, and are unknown to the World. Nei|ther are the Means of Grace appointed for &s;incere Believers as &s;uch, becau&s;e they are de&s;igned for the Conviction and Con|ver&s;ion of Sinners, as well as the Edification of Saints. <HI>Faith comes by Hearing.</HI> Be&s;ides, it cannot be certainly known who are &s;incere Believers. Men cannot &s;earch the Heart. It fol|lows then, that the Means of Grace are given to the vi&s;ible Church, to vi&s;ible Believers or Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ors and their Seed. Thus Mo&s;es in&s;tructed of Old. Thus I&s;rael under&s;tood and
<PB N="209" REF="009120_0114_1030F38717E10D68">
practi&s;ed. Yet the Doctrine of Election was as true, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;aving Faith as great then as it is now. Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles preached to Sinners and Saints, and commanded them to take Heed how they heard. And when the Apo&s;|tle Peter looked on Simon Magus to be unconverted, he di|rected him to repent and pray. There is no Doubt but Faith was implied in this Repentance and Prayer. For God requires Perfectne&s;s and Sincerity of Heart in every Duty. But the Que&s;tion here is this, and this only, &s;hould not Simon Magus attempt to pray till he knew he had &s;aving Faith? Did Peter give any Intimation to him that he might neglect Prayer, or that he ought not to pray at all while he continued in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s? Was not Simon Magus's Perver&s;ne&s;s a principal Part of his Inability? And is not this in &s;ome Sen&s;e the Im|potency of unconverted Sinners? If it is, I mu&s;t be permit|ted to a&s;k. Whether it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that God does not require Sinners to perform Duties, becau&s;e they are very aver&s;e to his Service? Will this Plea be a &s;ufficient Excu&s;e for their Ungodline&s;s?</P>
<P>If Sinners are taught that they may not do any Duty 'til they know they have &s;aving Faith, and are elected, left it &s;hould be of no Advantage to them; this cannot well fail to encou|rage them in their Sins, and make them very ea&s;y in that Ne|glect of Religion which is &s;o natural to them. Then it will al&s;o follow that they act very rea&s;onable, when according to their Cu&s;tom they carefully &s;trive again&s;t all Convictions of Sin, and to get rid of all Awakenings and &s;erious Impre&s;&s;ions as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. For they will, with Paul <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Acts ix. 11. compared with Rom. vii.</NOTE> in the like Ca&s;e, be earne&s;t in Prayer, while they have any &s;erious Impre&s;|&s;ions on their Minds. If &s;erious Convictions be, as the <HI>Mora|vians</HI> teach, a great Ob&s;tacle to hinder Men from believing in Chri&s;t, then the more &s;ecure and &s;inful they are, the more likely to get Faith and Salvation. Such Notions may be advanced with a Pretence of exalting the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and the Glory of free Grace; and they may be greedily imbibed by the unwary. But they appear to me the greate&s;t Affront that can be offered to Chri&s;t, a mon&s;trous Perver&s;ion of his Attonement, as if Chri&s;t had died <HI>to render impenitent Sinners accepted unto everla&s;ting Life,</HI> and thus excu&s;e them from Repen|tance and religious Duties. For don't &s;uch Notions make

Chri&s;t the Mini&s;ter of Sin with a Witne&s;s? I am bold to &s;ay that &s;uch Principles reduced to Practice will land in Damna|tion. But I hope the Hearts of &s;ome Antinomians are better than their Heads.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, I am certain of this that &s;uch Notions are not to be found in the Bible. When God promi&s;es to <Q>give I&s;rael a new Heart, and a new Spirit, and to take away the &s;tony Heart, and give them an Heart of Fle&s;h," he adds, "I will yet <HI>for</HI> this be enquired of by the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael to do <HI>it</HI> for them.</Q> God expre&s;sly commanded &s;peaking to the Wicked and Unrighteous, <Q>Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call ye upon him, while he is near.</Q> He appeals to Men's own Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience on this Point, when he a&s;ks, "Should not a People &s;eek unto their God?" Did not God approve of the Conduct of the Ninevites in cry|ing mightily unto him? Was not their Conduct more plea&s;ing to God, than if they had neglected Prayer, and gone on har|dened in their Sins? But who will &s;ay they all had the highe&s;t Kind of Faith. Such Principles are not agreeable to Paul's Experiences, Rom. vii. not to his Writings. He never taught that Sinners &s;hould do Evil that Good may come. But they are agreeable to the Principles and Practice of another Sort of People. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Job. xxi. 14, 15.</NOTE> <Q>they &s;ay unto God.

And no Wonder, &s;ince they don't love God nor his Law, and would fain be ex|cu&s;ed from Duty, and yet hope they &s;hall have Peace though they gratify their &s;inful Lu&s;ts. But God expre&s;sly declares, that all &s;uch Notions and Speeches are again&s;t him. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Mal. iii. 13 15. Ezek. xiii. 22.

by promi&s;ing him Life.</Q> It was the &s;lothful Servant who hated to take &s;uitable Pains in improving his Talent, who wickedly and impudently imagined he could throw the Blame on his Ma&s;ter, and pied that his Lord was an hard and au&s;tere Man.</P>
<P>Sinners if they &s;hould cry to their utmo&s;t to Eternity can do nothing at all towards working out a ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s, nor can they ever create them&s;elves a new in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto Good Works. And where does God command them to per|form Duties either before or after Faith with &s;uch Views? How|ever &s;ince they are &s;o ignorant and &s;o proud as not to know their own Weakne&s;s, 'till they have fully tried the Way of Ju&s;tifi|cation by Men's own Works, tho' it has been blocked up &s;ince Adam's Time &s;o that no Man ever obtained Acceptance in that Way. Yet it remains recorded and plainly de&s;cribed in the Scripture, that none may for&s;ake it, 'till they find by their own Experience they mu&s;t leave and renounce it, or peri&s;h.</P>
<P>But tho' Sinners are prone from their Ignorance and Pride to take this antiquated Path, and &s;o to oppo&s;e Chri&s;t and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, how does it follow, that it is the De&s;ign of the Spirit in convincing Sinners to build them up in Self-Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s? Or that what the Sinner does under his enlightning and convincing Influences has any &s;uch Tendency? The very Rever&s;e is true. For the&s;e Operations of the Spirit, and the Sinners finding his Attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h a ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;|ne&s;s all in vain, is one great Thing, that brings him to re|nounce Self Righteou&s;ne&s;s. And this may be done in a great Mea&s;ure before the Sinner &s;ees Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Righteou&s;|ne&s;s; yea, in many, who never have a &s;aving Di&s;covery of Chri&s;t at all. If it be a&s;ked what &s;upports the Sinner at &s;uch a Time? I an&s;wer we are apt to impo&s;e on our&s;elves by meta|phorical Terms. What &s;upports the Multitude of profane Sinners, of Heathens, &amp;c. Is it their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s? or Chri&s;ts? They are equally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;titute of both. What &s;upports them then? If this Que&s;tion has any Meaning, it mu&s;t be this when &s;tripped of Metaphor, How do they live along? or what defends them from the Fears of the Wrath to come? The true An&s;wer to it then is <HI>Forgetfulne&s;s</HI> of God and <HI>Security</HI> are their principal Support. Sinful Lu&s;t and Fooli&s;h Vanities divert many. The Cares of the World employ the Thoughts of Mul|titudes. In Reality Chri&s;tle&s;s Sinners receive le&s;s Support from their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s than from a Hundred other Things.
<PB N="212" REF="009120_0116_1030F38A9206C2E8">
Neither Scripture nor Rea&s;on prove that all Chri&s;tle&s;s Sinners con&s;tantly tru&s;t in their own Righteou&s;nes, or that their is any Nece&s;|&s;ity in the Nature of Things that they &s;hould always really de&s;ign to work out a ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s by attending on the Means of Grace. If Sinners could improve their Talents, the Means of Grace, while they remain in a State of Nature to no other Purpo&s;e than to build up a Righteou&s;nes of their own, in Oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t's, I think it is very &s;trange that the Holy Spirit &s;hould ever convince and awaken them, which always puts them on earne&s;t Seeking and Striving. For every Attempt of a Sinner to attain Ju&s;tification or become righteous before God by his own Works, and much more, every Imagination that God will a&s;&s;i&s;t him in any &s;uch Attempt mu&s;t be criminal in Man, and carries in it a di&s;honourable Reflexion on the Mo&s;t High. So that the Spirit can never be &s;ent to put Men on any &s;uch La|bour. It is likewi&s;e evident, that if Sinners mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily in all and every Thing that they perform, de&s;ign, and actually at|tempt, to build up their own Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s; the Lord would never have condemned the Servant for not improving his Talent. For as good fit idle, as do what is wor&s;e than No|thing. Better not build at all, than to build what mu&s;t be all thrown down; unle&s;s &s;uch fooli&s;h Attempts and Di&s;appoint|ments have &s;ome Tendency to teach the Man more Sen&s;e in coming Time. If all a Man's Attempts, even under &s;erious Convictions, to wait upon God for his Grace, to attend on Or|dinances, &amp;c. only lead him to build up in more hidden and re|fined, and con&s;equently in more dangerous Methods, his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s in Oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t's, he had better neglect Duties than perform them. Mo&s;t certainly God will never con|demn Men for not bring more diligent and laborious in build|ing up their own Works for a ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s, in Op|po&s;ition to the glorious Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t. Yet it is cer|tain, the &s;lothful Servant in the Parable was condemned for his Idlene&s;s and Mi&s;improvement of his Talent. Which &s;hews, that Sinners &s;hould improve their Advantages and Means of Grace, and not tru&s;t in their Duties; and that this is not im|po&s;&s;ible in the Nature of Things. Such as talk otherwi&s;e, give but too much Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that they are ignorant of the Il|luminations of the Holy Spirit, and the Way in which Men are brought to renounce their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s; or at lea&s;t that they have not duly attended to what has pa&s;&s;ed in their Minds.</P>

<P>As my Connexions with a particular Company gave Ri&s;e to what I have written, &s;o I have endeavoured to confute their Notions, &amp; obviate their Objections; otherwi&s;e I could not have an&s;wered my own De&s;ign, nor acted with tolerable Propriety; yet I have endeavoured to &s;trike at the Root of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, that &s;o the Addre&s;s may be of &s;ome Service again&s;t it in general.</P>
<P>If the Errors I have written again&s;t were trifling, or &s;uch as No body ever embraced, or attended with no bad Con&s;equences, I &s;hould not have taken &s;o much Pains to expo&s;e them. Yet many are not aware of any Dan|ger here. To convince &s;uch, I have reprinted an Account of John Lewis, and the Dutartres. The&s;e Accounts were &s;hort, they &s;uited my Purpo&s;e, they were publi&s;hed before. I gave them ju&s;t as I found them. But le&s;t &s;ome &s;hould imagine that only &s;uch weak and ignorant Per&s;ons were in Danger of following &s;uch Impul&s;es and Revelations, I have in&s;erted &s;ome others, particularly that &s;urpri&s;ing Incident in the Life of Lord Herbert, who was a Man of great natural Parts, and had made con&s;iderable At|tainments in Learning.&mdash;I will add here, that there is Nothing which is a greater Bar in hindring the Jews from embracing Chri&s;tianity, than the Regard they pay to their Oral Law, and their Spiritualizings, or Allegorical Interpretations of the Old-Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>The Addre&s;s is much longer than I had intended, becau&s;e I have been obliged to di&s;cu&s;s &s;undry Things that fell in my Way, which I had not particularly tho't of when I began to write. To prevent its being long|er, I have been obliged to be &s;o <HI>Iaconic</HI> on &s;everal Things, that I &s;hall he glad, if &s;undry Readers don't mi&s;take my Meaning. Some who are acquainted with tho&s;e again&s;t whom I have immediately written, will be ready to think, I have treated them with too much Lenity. But in this I have endeavoured to follow the Scripture Directions, not ren|dering Railing for Railing, but in Meekne&s;s in&s;tructing tho&s;e that op|po&s;e them&s;elves; if God peradventure will give them Repentance to the acknowledging the Truth.</P>
