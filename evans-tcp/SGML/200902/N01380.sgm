<P>IT is a very Awful thing for a Per&s;on to be deceived in his Faith; and it is an inex|cu&s;able Evil, when a per&s;on, thro' &s;loath or prejudice, will not love the Truth, &s;o as to &s;ubmit to the Evidence of it, when it is laid before him.</P>
<P>Some Errors are &s;uch, that he that believes them will be Damned, 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 2.11, 12. but others are &s;uch, that except a per&s;on willfully hold them, again&s;t the evidence of his Con|&s;cience, they may be ranked among the Infir|mities even of Believers.</P>
<P>Of this latter kind, I take the en&s;uing Con|trover&s;y to be, and therefore have been always loath to meddle with it. Not but that I be|lieve it is well worth the labour, and is in it &s;elf a great Duty; but le&s;t by &s;o doing I &s;hould do the le&s;s in things, which more im|mediately concern <HI>Judgment, Mercy</HI> and <HI>Faith,</HI> and le&s;t by &s;triving to mend Faults in the Practice of the <HI>Out&s;ide</HI> part of Religon, I &s;hould &s;tir up &s;trife and cau&s;e people to neg|lect the <HI>inward</HI> part of Religion, and break the bands of Love to one another, and &s;o
<PB REF="001635_0006_0FB3E2222C6DB3F8">make a greater Fault than I mend; belie|ving, that <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> who hold and live ac|cording to the e&s;&s;ential part of Religion, ought to Love one another, and bear with one anothers Infirmities, and prudently to avoid tho&s;e things, which otherwi&s;e might be very needful, rather than make a <HI>Rent</HI> and <HI>Schi&s;m</HI> (and &s;o hinder mutual Edification) in the more <HI>vital</HI> part of Religion. For a per&s;on may be baptized and yet be a very wicked Man; but a Man cannot exerci&s;e <HI>&s;ound Repentance,</HI> a <HI>lively Faith, true Humility, unfeigned Love,</HI> and a <HI>holy Life,</HI> and yet be a wicked Man.</P>
<P>Wherefore I always avoided the&s;e Contro|ver&s;ies, yet carefully practi&s;ed that which I believe the <HI>Right,</HI> and never refu&s;ed to give my Rea&s;ons for what I held, when I was asked.</P>
<P>But now I am called to &s;peak, and dare no longer keep &s;ilence, becau&s;e of a Book, which I have formerly read (hoping, if I was in an Error, to be <HI>Convinced,</HI> but if in the Truth, <HI>Confirmed</HI>) and returned it to the Owner, but made no &s;tir about it, becau&s;e it was not very publick.</P>
<P>But of late this Book is Re-printed, and &s;pread among us, and given among the People
<PB REF="001635_0007_0FB3E223A30D82C0">under my Charge, as well as among others; and many people, who hold with it, glory in it abundantly.</P>
<P>Wherefore, I knowing the fal&s;e Arguments and other un&s;ufferable Evils in it, do account it would be &s;inful Silence in me to be &s;ilent, when I &s;ee not only Gentlemen, not here to &s;peak for them&s;elves (I think) &s;landered, but al&s;o the Truth run down, Fal&s;hood believed, and the Weak deceived, and, it may be, &s;ome &s;educed from the right Way of Wor&s;hip, whom it is my Charge to defend, I may not wait till it can be done by an abler hand, nor take much time about it my &s;elf; but it is &s;o ea&s;ie to an&s;wer that there is little need of either.</P>
<P>If my writing increa&s;e <HI>Anger,</HI> and hinder <HI>Love</HI> in &s;ome, I cannot help it; I &s;hall en|deavour to treat the erroncous Narrator with as ea&s;ie Language as the Truth will bear.</P>
<P>But the chief de&s;ign of this <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> is to intreat the <HI>Reader,</HI> for Gods &s;ake, and for his Souls fake, to take heed and lay a&s;ide all Pre|judice when he comes to read this, &amp; compare with that, what it undertakes to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I advi&s;e him (if he be a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>) to make his earne&s;t Reque&s;t at the Throne of Grace, before he read it, That God would (in his infinite Mercy in Je&s;us Chri&s;t) cau&s;e him to
<PB REF="001635_0008_0FB3E22520904DC0">&s;ee and believe the Truth, and &s;ave him from believing Error, or rejecting the Evidence of Truth, whether it be on the One part or the Other. For which end, that he take away all prevailing Prejudice, or de&s;ire of believing the one or the other, le&s;t he be like tho&s;e <HI>who did not receive the love of the Truth, and &s;o God gave them up to &s;trong Delu&s;ions to believe a Lye, that they might be Damned.</HI> Know, that all your Will and Rea&s;on and Means will neither bring you <HI>TO</HI> nor keep you <HI>IN</HI> the Truth, without Gods ble&s;&s;ing, which is not promi&s;ed, except you &s;eek aright, <HI>James</HI> 4.3, 4.</P>
<P>Pray do not make the Reading of this a hindrance to your Exerci&s;e in the &s;piritual part of Religion, but while you are informing your &s;elf in the Doctrine of the <HI>Admini&s;tration of Bapti&s;m,</HI> let your chief care be to be made Partaker of the <HI>Grace</HI> repre&s;ented in <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> otherwi&s;e you will have the <HI>Shell</HI> without the <HI>Kirnell.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE Port&s;mouth Di&s;pute <HI>EXAMINED.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>On the Narrative in general.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I have &s;everal Rea&s;ons to que&s;tion the Truth of the Narrative of the <HI>Port&s;muoth</HI> Di&s;pute, as it is related by Dr. <HI>Ru&s;sel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I take Notice in the Dedication, that he compo&s;ed it from &s;everal Letters compared toge|ther, and the help of his own Memory. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> &s;ent him the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">uments which he u&s;ed, and what el&s;e he could remember; whereas if tho&s;e that writ could have taken it all, he had not needed all this; but in this way it was impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould collect a true Narrative of a near eight hours Di&s;putation.</P>
<P>His own Arguments he might in part remem|ber, and Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> his; but who &s;ent him the Arguments of their Antagoni&s;ts? Therefore I think h<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">re are, comparatively, but few of them,
<PB N="2" REF="001635_0010_0FB3E228342F63E8">and tho&s;e that are delivered, in &s;uch a way that they may ea&s;ily, be an&s;wered; nor can it <HI>thus</HI> hardly po&s;&s;ibly be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> In the Dedication they tell, that Mr. <HI>Ro|bin&s;on</HI> gave one of them the <HI>Lye,</HI> but I do not find it in the Narrative, which, &s;ince they have publi|&s;hed it here, I conclude, it would not have been wanting there, if their Memory would have &s;er|ved to know where to place it; which &s;hews that there is much wanting.</P>
<P><HI>3dly.</HI> In &s;ix or eight hours Di&s;cour&s;e without Intermi&s;&s;ion, would have made a much larger Volumn than the Whole Book, whereas a great part of the Book is made up of other matter, as the Dedication, &amp;c. and many remarks of Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;els</HI> after the Di&s;pute, and his Quotations in the end of the Book.</P>
<P><HI>4thly,</HI> I find &s;everal times that he tells us of a long Di&s;cour&s;e of one of their Antagoni&s;ts about &s;uch or &s;uch a thing, but relates little of it, and &s;ometimes &s;ays it was not worth Writing.</P>
<P><HI>5thly. I</HI> have heard &s;everal wayes, and from &s;uch as know not each other, that this is a fal&s;e Narrative, and that it has occa&s;ioned the true (really taken from the Town-Clerks) Notes to be al&s;o printed.</P>
<P><HI>6thly.</HI> Another Rea&s;on, which confirms me in it, is, that according to this Narrative the <HI>Pre&s;by|terians</HI> have acted as if their very de&s;ign was to give away their Cau&s;e, by calling a multi|tude together to hear, and then purpo&s;ely pre|tending to di&s;pute, but always making &s;ure to
<PB N="3" REF="001635_0011_0FB3E229AE743A28">leave room to be an&s;wered, and giving their Opponents opportunity to frame their Argu|ments, and pretending to an&s;wer them, but always making &s;ure to leave them them unan&s;|wered. It can hardly be that they were &s;erious if this Narrative be True.</P>
<P><HI>7thly.</HI> I find much &s;aid by him, but little by his Antagoni&s;ts through the Book, &amp;c.</P>
<P>My <HI>8th Rea&s;on</HI> I leave till afterwards. But is not this very unfair, (not to call it wor&s;e) if they not only to detract from Mens Reputation, but al&s;o deceive people (by a fal&s;e Narrative) in things concerning their Salvation; (making people believe, this is the &s;trength of what is alledged again&s;t their way, when indeed it is not the tenth part, yea, <HI>I</HI> may &s;ay, not the hundredth part of it, as to &s;olid Arguments) For the tell|ing a part of the truth, and leaving out a part, is many times as pernicious Lying, as utter|ing down-right fal&s;hood, and many times does more harm, becau&s;e it is more ea&s;ily believed. And if I may &s;ay it, without Comparing the Narrator to him, the Devil, the Father of Lyes does, for the mo&s;t part, exerci&s;e his mo&s;t hurt|ful fal&s;hood this way. However, <HI>I</HI> will hope that the Narrator (having &s;o light an e&s;teem of the Arguments which he thinks are again&s;t the truth) did &s;et down all the Arguments brought again&s;t him, which he thought had any weight in them &s;o far as they came to his knowledge.</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t, as a Friend, advi&s;e the <HI>Antipaedo-Bapti&s;ts</HI> to di&s;own this Narrative, (under the&s;e circum&s;tances) left they make people think they
<PB N="4" REF="001635_0012_0FB3E22B214862C0">re&s;emble the Kingdom of the Devil, which is built up by Lyes, and le&s;t people think they are con&s;cious, that their Cau&s;e is &s;o weak that truth alone is not &s;ufficient to defend it, and left People think it is not for <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> &s;ake that they hold their way, but from &s;ome am|bitious Contentions and uncharitable Di&s;po&s;ition; For any one may know, that he, that holds any Tenet for Con&s;cience-&s;ake, will de&s;ire no|thing but the Truth to defend it, and his Con|&s;cience will oblige him as &s;oon to believe the contrary, when he &s;ees good Evidence for it. But whether this Narrative be true or fal&s;e, the Truth is the Truth, if tho&s;e men could not de|fend it. And it not being defended in this Nar|rative, is the rea&s;on of my writing this Reply.</P>
<P>I take Notice al&s;o of (<HI>I</HI> think) a contradicti|on; in the Title-page it is &s;aid, <HI>It was taken from two Copies taken at the Di&s;pute;</HI> And in the Dedication he tells us of other Letters, his Memory, &amp;c. If part of it was taken from tho&s;e Copies, yet it is not true to &s;ay, the Narrative was, except it was all.</P>
<P>I al&s;o ob&s;erve in the Dedication, That Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> &s;eems to be concern'd for his own honour, by publi&s;hing to the world, <HI>That his Preaching was approved,</HI> and how he de&s;erves <HI>the Title of Doctor,</HI> and being concerned left his partner, Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> &s;hould have the greate&s;t &s;hare of the <HI>Honour of their Days works,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>What he &s;poke was far &s;hort of what Dr.</HI> Ru&s;&s;el <HI>&s;poke.</HI> But it may be he had good cau&s;e for all this.</P>
<P>So <HI>I</HI> proceed to their Arguements, wherein I
<PB N="5" REF="001635_0013_0FB3E22CC09FFD08">&s;hall always repeat the <HI>Medium,</HI> and &s;o much more, that the Argument compo&s;ed, &s;hall be clearly under&s;tood, and I hope to leave none of their Arguments unan&s;wered, either directly, or by an&s;|wering other Arguments; and &s;uch as que&s;tion it may have recour&s;e to the Narrative it &s;elf, which is now plentiful in the Country.</P>
<P>In the General, I find not one Argument u&s;ed by them, but what is either a Fallacy or improved into a Fallacy. And never did I before &s;ee &s;o much Sophi&s;try put together and approved by a learned Man. If it had been one that knew not the Rules of Argument, he might be better excu&s;ed. I am &s;orry to offend his Friends, by &s;aying it, but I dare not mince the Truth when I am called to &s;peak; He has often &s;aid wor&s;e of his Antagoni&s;ts, both in his Dedication and Narrative, and that without cau&s;e. But <HI>I</HI> mu&s;t proceed to &s;hew that <HI>I</HI> have cau&s;e to &s;ay this.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II <HI>On Dr.</HI> Ru&s;&s;el's <HI>fir&s;t Argument.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe fir&s;t Que&s;tion in the Di&s;pute was (as he re|lates it,)</P>
<P><HI>Whether, according to the Commi&s;&s;ion of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Adult believers are only the proper Subjects of</HI> Bapti&s;m, <HI>and not Infants?</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> takes it in the Affirmative, and his fir&s;t Argument is,</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001635_0014_0FB3E22EE2751B20">
<HI>If Chri&s;t hath no where required any of his Mini&s;ters to Baptize Infants, then the Bapti&s;m of Infants is not according to the Commi&s;&s;ion of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But Chri&s;t hath no where required any of his Mini&s;ters to Baptize Infants.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ergo.</HI></P>
<P>This Argument is well enough according to the Rule, but his fallacy is in proving it, as we &s;hall &s;ee by his in&s;i&s;ting to have them expre&s;&s;ed in the Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;aying, <HI>That &s;ome are expre&s;ly Commanded to be Baptized in the Commi&s;&s;ion.</HI> The fallacy lies here, <HI>[Expre&s;&s;ed]</HI> is a Word that may be taken &s;everal ways, and &s;o have one &s;ignification in the <HI>Major,</HI> and another in the <HI>Minor,</HI> which will nece&s;&s;arily make a fal&s;e conclu&s;ion, as every Logician well knows. For thus it is, Some are expre&s;&s;ed in the Commi&s;&s;ion, viz. <HI>Believers</HI> and <HI>Di&s;ciples,</HI> but the Commi&s;&s;ion does not tell us, whether they be <HI>Adult</HI> or <HI>Infants,</HI> it may be either or both, or neither, if a third &s;ort could be found, notwith|&s;tanding tho&s;e Words; But under the Name of Believers and Di&s;ciples are expre&s;&s;ed the per&s;ons that are &s;o, whether Adult or Infants.</P>
<P>But to &s;hew his fallacy, and prove the contrary to his Minor,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> By his way of arguing, and their way of An&s;wering (as here related) he would have been as hard put to it to prove Adult per&s;ons included in the Commi&s;&s;ion; for they are no more expre&s;&s;ed than Infants; But by as good Con&s;equence as expre&s;s Words, &s;ome Adult per&s;ons are ex|cluded
<PB N="7" REF="001635_0015_0FB3E22FA2903C70">and others included; and I hope by Gods Grace to make the &s;ame appear of Infants.</P>
<P>Yea, by his arguing, how will he prove him&s;elf <HI>a Mini&s;ter,</HI> &s;eeing he is not <HI>exper&s;&s;ed</HI> in the Com|mi&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> The <HI>Quakers</HI> argue the very &s;ame again&s;t Bapti&s;m with Watter, becau&s;e Water is not ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the Commi&s;&s;ion, or any Command; and in truth, they have equal Rea&s;on for it, and I know not one of his Arguments to prove his fir&s;t by, but what the <HI>Quakers</HI> u&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>3dly.</HI> That Infants are as much expre&s;&s;ed in the Commi&s;&s;ion as the Adulte I prove thus,</P>
<P><HI>All that are Believers in Chri&s;t are included in the Commi&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But There are Infants who are Believers in Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Ergo, <HI>There are Infants included in the Comm&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>The Major will not be di&s;puted. The Minor I Prove thus,</P>
<P><HI>All that are &s;aved by Chri&s;t are Believers in Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But there are Infants &s;aved by Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Ergo, <HI>There are Infants who are Believers in Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The Minor I think will be granted: The Major I &s;hall prove. But fir&s;t, to feed the <HI>Antipedobapti&s;ts</HI> with a little of their own meat, I cite <HI>Mark</HI> 16.16. <HI>He that Believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> The foregoing Words, <HI>He that Believeth and is Baptized,</HI> is impro|ved by <HI>them</HI> with that <HI>Acts</HI> 8.37. to prove that a profes&s;ion of faith is pre-requi&s;ite to bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>I argue, either the&s;e texts concern only the Adult, or it concerns Adult and Infants both. If it concern only the Adult, then Infants are not concerned in it, and if Infants are not concerned
<PB N="8" REF="001635_0016_0FB3E231208AB428">in it, then here is nothing to be proved for or a|gain&s;t Infants Bapti&s;m by it. Yea, &s;uppo&s;e Infants have not Faith, the&s;e Scriptures &s;peaking nothing of them, but only of Adult, that Faith is a nece&s;|&s;ary pre-requi&s;it to Bapti&s;m in them which Believe and practi&s;e. The&s;e Texts do not prove but that Infants may be Baptized without Faith, though Adult may not, as well as be &s;aved without Faith, as the <HI>Antipedobapti&s;ts</HI> believe they are. Therefore if the&s;e and &s;uch like Texts concern not Infants, let them not plead any more <HI>Believe and be baptized,</HI> again&s;t Infants Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>They mu&s;t take &s;ome other Arguments to deny them Bapti&s;m, if they will do it.</P>
<P>But if &s;uch Texts do concern Adult and Infants both, then it mu&s;t follow of Infants &s;o well as Adult They either are Believers, or el&s;e they are Damned. But there are Infants, who dye in Infancy, are &s;a|ved and not damned. Therefore they are Believers, and therefore &s;o well or as much expre&s;&s;ed in the Commi&s;&s;ion as adult Believers.</P>
<P>But take it either way, and it is as rational to infer from &s;uch Scriptures, that Infants are dam|ned, as that they are not the Subjects of Bapti&s;m. But they &s;ay, <HI>Infants cannot have Faith for want of the Act of &V;nder&s;tanding and Will.</HI> pag. 54.</P>
<P>I Reply,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> A Man has not the exerci&s;e or act of his Under&s;tanding when he is a &s;leep, and few men have it when they dye, &s;hall we from thence infer that they dye Unbelievers, and are damned, or that Unbelievers are &s;aved?</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> This which is the foundation of denying
<PB N="9" REF="001635_0017_0FB3E232A26A8FE8">Infants Bapti&s;m, is wholy Un&s;criptural, and again&s;t expre&s;s Scripture, and is the very &s;ame Argument u&s;ed by the <HI>Pelagians</HI> to deny Original &s;in; and if the one may be denyed by it, the other may al&s;o. Or does God require more to con&s;titute a good Act than he imputes to be an evil Act? But hence many <HI>Antipedobaptists</HI> deny original Sin with <HI>Pelagius</HI> their Father. Therefore I advi&s;e &s;uch of them as believe Original Sin, to reject this Argument, le&s;t they bring in that Old Here&s;y, and overthrow all &s;ound Repentance.</P>
<P><HI>3dly.</HI> It matters not to us in what &s;ence they may be &s;aid to believe, &s;o long as God owns them for Believers, by giving them the Priviledge of Be|lievers, which is Salvation. I argue thus:</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that God does own for Believers, by gi|ving them the Priviledge of Believers, we ought to own for Believers included in the Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But God doth own Infants for Believers, by giving them the Priviledge of Believers.</P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> we ought to own them for Believers inclu|ded in the Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If they deny the Major, let then &s;hew us by what Rule they can &s;hew us, that God requires us to make a diffrence, where he makes none.</P>
<P>If they deny the Minor, they mu&s;t deny that Infants are &s;aved by Faith, and &s;o bring in a new way of Salvation, never heard of in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> will not here plead for the <HI>Acts</HI> of Faith, nor undertake to prove a <HI>Habit</HI> of Faith in infants; It matters not, whether I know what it is or no, &s;o long as I know it is that which God accepts of for Faith, and therefore that His Mini&s;ters ought to
<PB N="10" REF="001635_0018_0FB3E23426E1C028">do it al&s;o, and that God does give them the Pri|viledge of Believers by &s;aving them, and therefore that his Mini&s;ters ought to do it by Baptizing them.</P>
<P>But to prove that Infants are &s;aved by Faith, whatever that Faith be, I argue,</P>
<P>All that are &s;aved, are in this World &s;anctifyed, <HI>Hebr.</HI> 12.14. <HI>Holine&s;s without which no man</HI> (or as the prime Signification of the Word <HI>oudeis</HI> is <HI>no one</HI>) <HI>&s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI> Eccl. 11.3.</P>
<P>But there are Infants that are &s;aved.</P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> there are Infants in this World &s;anctifyed.</P>
<P>I hope they will not &s;ay that this Text al&s;o &s;peaks only of the Adult, and &s;o that Infants may be &s;aved without Holine&s;s, and &s;o make God unholy, which they mu&s;t do, or grant my Argument, or el&s;e deny Original Sin, as <HI>Pelagius</HI> a Heretick about four hunderd Years after Chri&s;t, denyed Infant Bapti&s;m, and with &s;ome rea&s;on, according to his principle; For he denyed Original Sin, and &s;o be|lieving they had no Sin nor pollution by Sin, be believed they needed no clean&s;ing nor Sign of clean&s;ing.</P>
<P>So denying Infants Bapti&s;m, and denying Origi|nal Sin agree excellent well together, as has been &s;hewn before, and may be &s;hewed again.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e &s;ome <HI>Antipedobapti&s;ts</HI> will deny any thing rather than yield, I digre&s;s one word for that.</P>
<P>All that Chri&s;t came to &s;ave are &s;inners,</P>
<P>But Chri&s;t came to &s;ave Infants,</P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> Infants are Sinners.</P>
<P>The Major is evident, the Miner <HI>I</HI> prove thus:</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="001635_0019_0FB3E235A862E1E8">
If none under Heaven among men can be &s;aved but by Chri&s;t, then Infants cannot be &s;aved but by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But none under Heaven among men can be &s;aved but by Chri&s;t. <HI>Ergo.</HI></P>
<P>See Acts 4 12. The Greek word here <HI>[anthropes]</HI> as here u&s;ed, &s;ignifies, <HI>All Men, Women</HI> and <HI>Children,</HI> not one excepted. Therefore Infants are Sinners.</P>
<P>As the Faith of Infants, &s;o their Sin is that which <HI>I</HI> do not undertake to de&s;cribe: But thus far I think, no man of rea&s;on can deny to follow of con&s;equence, That as our Saviour, &s;o <HI>Adam</HI> being a publick Per&s;on, to act in &s;ome things for his Po&s;terity, <HI>Adam</HI> by &s;in having lo&s;t that which is greate&s;t of all, <HI>viz.</HI> his Right and Title to <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Delight,</HI> in the enjoyment of the light of Gods Countenance, could not leave it to his Po&s;terity, and &s;o they are born without a Title to it, and cannot recover it but by that which God accepts of for Faith in Chri&s;t. And that he, having lo&s;t his Priviledge of ever being received into Glory, <HI>by keeping the Law,</HI> could not leave that Priviledge to his Children, and &s;o they are born without it, and now cannot be received into Glory but by Faith in Chri&s;t. And <HI>Adam</HI> having his whole na|ture corrupted with <HI>an aver&s;ion</HI> from God and Holine&s;s, could not beget Children of another na|ture, and therefore they cannot be received into Glory, till they are &s;anctified. So <HI>I</HI> argue,</P>
<P>If Sanctification cannot be without Faith, then all that are Sanctified have Faith.</P>
<P>But &s;anctification cannot be without Faith.</P>
<P>Therefore all that are &s;anctified, have Faith.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="001635_0020_0FB3E2372CB08188">
The &s;equel of the <HI>Major</HI> is &s;elf evident. The Proof of the <HI>Minor</HI> we &s;hall hear more afterwards. So I argue,</P>
<P>If Infants are Sanctifyed, Infants have Faith.</P>
<P>But Infants are Sanctifyed.</P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> Infants have Faith.</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> Gods Love to Man is di&s;tingui&s;hed into a Love of <HI>Benevolence,</HI> or willing them Good, a Love of <HI>Beneficence,</HI> or doing them Good; and a Love of <HI>Complacency,</HI> or being plea&s;ed with them. With a Love of Benevolence God Loves his Elect from Eternity; and before their Conver&s;ion or Sanctifi|cation, with a Love of Beneficence when he does them good; and with a Love of Complacency, when they are &s;anctified, and not before.</P>
<P>So <HI>I</HI> argue,</P>
<P>All that are fit to be &s;aved, God loves with a Love of Complacency, <HI>i. e.</HI> they plea&s;e God.</P>
<P>But there are Infants fit to be &s;aved, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;ancti|fyed.</P>
<P>Therefore there are Infants that plea&s;e God.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> think neither part will or can be denyed by any.</P>

<P>None can plea&s;e God but &s;uch as have Faith, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.6.</P>

<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> there are Infants that have Faith.</P>

It matters Not to us what this Regeneration &amp; Faith in Infants is, &s;o long as it is &s;omething real, and God accepts it.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly. I</HI> having from two undeniable arguments proved Infants Faith, proceed to expre&s;s Scripture, Mat. 18.6. <HI>Who&s;o &s;hall offend one of the&s;e little ones that believe in me.</HI></P>
<P>That this is &s;poken properly of a little <HI>Child</HI> or In|fant (whatever &s;ome Annotators may &s;ay) appears from the&s;e Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t.</HI> If it were not litterally a little child or Infant, the end of our Saviours calling or &s;etting him before his di&s;ciples was lo&s;t.

It mu&s;t have been a child who by rea&s;on of his ten|der age had none of the&s;e faults. I think it mu&s;t have been a very young Infant; And if it had been one called a child, becau&s;e of his child-like Humility, &amp;c. this was no &s;ign to tho&s;e that knew not his heart, and they would have thought them|&s;elves as good as he.</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>Such a child may be offended.</HI> I an&s;wer;</P>
<P>If offending be taken for <HI>Afflicting</HI> or making <HI>&s;orrowful,</HI> this may be done to a young &s;ucking Child.</P>
<P>If offending be taken for <HI>Di&s;honour, Reproach and Scandal,</HI> this may be done to an Infant new born, by denying him to be a member of Chri&s;t's Church, and &s;o ranking him among the Heathen.</P>
<P>If it be taken for a <HI>Stumbling-block</HI> and hinde|rance of his Edification, this may be done by put|ting them to be brought up where he &s;hall not learn to know his Maker, Redeemer and Sanctifyer, or by &s;etting evil examples before him when he begins to come to under&s;tanding, and while he is yet an Infant, as to his being capable of any knowledge.</P>
<P><HI>3dly.</HI> A third pretence is, that <HI>&s;uch a Child is &s;aid to believe in Chri&s;t.</HI> And the fear of believing this, is it that makes &s;ome &s;o loath to believe this place litterally; For &s;ome men will bend Gods Holy Word any way rather then bend them&s;elves to that. But to &s;ay, they have that which God owns for Faith, and is as &s;ufficient for them as the Faith of adult per&s;ons is for them, takes away this objec|tion. Now &s;eeing all the other objections are taken away, <HI>I</HI> have not only inconte&s;table proofs from Scripture <HI>Con&s;equence,</HI> but expre&s;s Scripture Te&s;ti|mony, that there are little Children or Infants which do believe in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And from the Text and Context <HI>I</HI> do infer and

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>On Dr.</HI> Ru&s;&s;el'<HI>s &s;econd Argument.</HI></HEAD>
<P>His Second Argument is,</P>
<P><HI>If Infants are not capable to be made Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t by the Mini&s;try of Men, then they cannot po&s;&s;ibly be the &s;ubject of Bapti&s;m intended in Chri&s;ts Commi&s;|&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But Infants are not capable to be made Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t by the Mini&s;try of Men. Ergo.</HI></P>
<P>I deny his <HI>Minor,</HI> and affirm the contrary. For their Parents being brought into the School of Chri&s;t, to be learners of the Word, and that by the Mini&s;try of Men; this brings the Children al&s;o in, and they no &s;ooner begin to under&s;tand, but they begin to learn, and that by vertue of their Parents Di&s;cipleship, without any further work of the Mini&s;try than what was improved on their Parents. So the Mini&s;try of Men is the cau&s;e ef|fectually of their being learners of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and a Di&s;ciple is nothing but a Learner. It matters not whether the Mini&s;try be immedi|ately
<PB N="17" REF="001635_0025_0FB3E23EC59B4D80">the cau&s;e of their di&s;cipleship, or mediately by their Parents, &s;o it be the cau&s;e in Gods hand. We &s;ee by experience that the Children of true Di&s;ciples are always <HI>thus</HI> di&s;cipled; and they were entred in the School the day that their Parents were either Converted or brought to acknowledge the Truth' and &s;eriou&s;ly to Learn it, and if they are born afterwards, they are born in the School, and devoted to be learners of Chri&s;t. But it is not &s;o with the Children of <HI>Heathen</HI> or other Prophane Per&s;ons, who teach not their children as Di&s;ciples ought to be taught in <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Ex|ample.</HI></P>
<P>And Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> an&s;wered well, by di&s;tingui&s;h|ing between <HI>compleat</HI> and <HI>incompleat</HI> Di&s;ciples; But this Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> could not bear, nor be found to un|der&s;tand it.</P>
<P>The truth is, it was too hard for him, and &s;o he blames &s;uch <HI>Di&s;tinctions</HI> as <HI>Equivocable Expre&s;&s;ions.</HI> Surely Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> mu&s;t know that Di&s;tinctions are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the right under&s;tanding of the Truth, whether in Divinity or Philo&s;ophy, and what el&s;e is intended by tho&s;e Words, 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.15. <HI>Rightly dividing the word of Truth.</HI> And in Di&s;pu|tations, one &s;pecial u&s;e of Di&s;tinctions is to avoid the Fallacy of Equivocable Expre&s;&s;ions. It is a general Rule <HI>Qui bene di&s;tinguit, bene docet.</HI> He that Di&s;tingui&s;hes well, Teacheth well. But this was one of the Doctors Remarks after the Di&s;|pute was over, which might take with the ig|norant Reader, and, it may be, help prevail with him to be plunged before he &s;hould hear it an&s;wered, <HI>I</HI> think he knew that we u&s;e this Di|&s;tinction,
<PB N="18" REF="001635_0026_0FB3E2402C0C7958">and it was his bufine&s;s to make appear that there is no &s;uch di&s;tinction, if he did not believe it.</P>
<P>An infant is an in compleat Subject of the King. He is a real Subject, and the King defends him for a &s;ubject, and yet he cannot perform one action of Subjection.</P>
<P>As God does not expect that of any Creature, which he never made him capable of, &s;o we do not expect that the Faith or di&s;ciple&s;hip is the &s;ame with that of Adult per&s;ons, who are capable of more, yet we believe it as acceptable with God, who has no need of our Service, and that what God has affixed his promi&s;e to in them, is as effectual a means for them as hearing and learning is for grown per&s;ons. So I argue,</P>
<P>If God own the infants of believing Parents, giving them the Ble&s;&s;ings that belong to Di&s;ci|ples, obliging him&s;elf to them by his Covenant pro|mi&s;e, owning them as <HI>nigh</HI> and not afar off, and giving to &s;ome of them &s;anctifying Grace, which implyes all that he does for grown Di&s;ciples, and that on the account of their Parents di&s;ciple&s;hip, then he owns them as Di&s;ciples, &amp; we ought to own them as Di&s;ciples</P>
<P>But all this God does for them, and that on the account of their Parents Di&s;eiple&s;hip.</P>
<P><HI>Ergo.</HI></P>
<P>Now all that are brough into the School of Chri&s;t, or born in the School, they and their Children, &s;o continuing, are under Gods Covenant promi&s;e, &amp; therefore he gives to them all &s;aving Grace, except they tran&s;gre&s;s the Condition after, which we do
<PB N="19" REF="001635_0027_0FB3E241A5AD1C70" MS="y">not know that infants can do.</P>
<P>And Heathens al&s;o after they are called and brought in, are under this Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>But what God does with the Infants of Unbe|lievers, he has not told us, and &s;o it is none of our bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire; Nor has he told us what he does with any infants that are not devoted to be learners of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Now that &s;aving Grace is the thing promi&s;ed, appears <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 44.3.5. and that this promi&s;e is made to grown Di&s;ciples and their Children, appears <HI>Acts</HI> 2.38, 39. <HI>I</HI> argue.</P>
<P>Either the Children of tho&s;e new Believers were of the number of tho&s;e afar off, or they were not.</P>
<P>If they were, then their Parents were al&s;o; for it may be either three &s;orts, or but one &s;ort that are &s;poken of. If but one &s;ort, then the Parents, Children, and &s;trangers were all the &s;ame per&s;ons, which is the greate&s;t Non-&s;en&s;e; But the Scripture &s;peaks of them as three &s;orts, whereof <HI>Two</HI> are nigh, and <HI>One</HI> afar off.</P>
<P>But if they were not afar off, then they were nigh, that is, of the Church <HI>de Jure,</HI> and &s;o under the Covenant-Promi&s;e; for there are but tho&s;e afar off, and tho&s;e that are nigh, <HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>World</HI> and the <HI>Church.</HI> See more Eph. 2.12. to 18. where al&s;o we find, that tho&s;e afar off <HI>were &s;trangers to the Covenant of Promi&s;e,</HI> and this being a property of their unhappine&s;s, it mu&s;t be, that tho&s;e that were nigh, were not &s;trangers to it. Therefore the Children of believing Parents being not afar off, out nigh, are not &s;tranger to it, but fellows citi|zens under the Priveledge of Di&s;ciples contained in the promi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="001635_0028_0FB3E2432A9DBE88" MS="y">
So it follows,</P>
<P>That the Children of grown Di&s;ciples are belie|vers, who are made &s;o by the Mini&s;try of Men, have the &s;ame Priviledges of Gods Covenant-Pro|mi&s;e with their Parents, and the Mini&s;try is the cau&s;e of both, by one Act.

<P><HI>Di&s;ciple&s;hip</HI> is nothing but that which brings us under the advantage of obtaining &s;aving Grace, or making a greater progre&s;s and growth therein, by bringing us into that &s;tate, which has Gods Promi&s;e annexed to it, which in grown per&s;ons is, The Diligent u&s;e of the Means God hath ap|pointed, as <HI>Hearing, Learning,</HI> &amp;c. and in Infants it is the <HI>being the Children</HI> of &s;uch Parents devoted by Bapti&s;m, till they are grown big enough to learn, and then by the learning they have from them.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay but that God does u&s;ually defer the giving affectual &s;aving Grace to &s;uch as live to grow up, till they make choice for them&s;elves, wherein they have the Promi&s;e of &s;aving Grace, and con&s;e|quently Salvation, upon condition, that they im|prove well the means which they now enjoy, which Promi&s;e the <HI>Heathen</HI> have not, and this is to be a Di&s;ciple, or el&s;e tho&s;e that left our Saviour, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.66. were no Di&s;ciples; but if they be not &s;uf|ficiently Taught, that is their Parents breach of Vow. &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="001635_0029_0FB3E2449FFD1A28">
<HI>I</HI> further argue, from Acts 2.39.</P>
<P>Either tho&s;e Words, <HI>As many as the Lord your God &s;hall call,</HI> have reference to tho&s;e Children of Believers, or they have not. If they have, then tho&s;e Children were not yet called, but &s;ome of them were to be called, yet tho&s;e Children were not reckoned among tho&s;e afar off, <HI>i. e.</HI> the World, and therefore mu&s;t be reckoned among tho&s;e that were nigh, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Church.

But if tho&s;e Words have not reference to tho&s;e Children of Believers, then they are expre&s;ly un|der the Promi&s;e by being the Children of Believers, without re&s;pect to any other call.</P>
<P>Chu&s;e which you will.</P>
<P>Now the rea&s;on here given for Bapti&s;m is the Promi&s;e; And if Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> can give a Rea&s;on to cut off the Apo&s;tles Rea&s;on, and &s;hew us why the Apo&s;tles Rea&s;on is not &s;ufficient for one, &s;o well as another, let him do it: In the mean time, till Scripture teach us to make a diffrence, we dare make none.</P>
<P>Now if Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el's</HI> Argument be true, That none may be Baptized but Di&s;ciples, made &s;o by the Mini&s;try of Men,</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> argue,</P>
<P>All that are under the Covenant promi&s;e mu&s;t be baptized, according to the Commi&s;&s;ion (if the
<PB N="22" REF="001635_0030_0FB3E24630854F78">Apo&s;tles knew the Commi&s;&s;ion and acted by it.)</P>
<P>But Infants are under the Covenant promi&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> Infants are to be baptized, according to the Commi&s;&s;ion,</P>
<P>Whence, <HI>All that are to be Baptized, according to the Commi&s;&s;ion, are made Di&s;ciples by the Mini&s;try of Men.</HI></P>
<P>Infants are to be baptized, according to the Commi&s;&s;ion;</P>
<P><HI>Ergo</HI> Infants are made Di&s;ciples by the Mini&s;try of Men; and therefore are capable to be made &s;o. And I will believe the Apo&s;tles of our Lord and Saviour, &s;ooner than I will believe Dr. <HI>Ru&s;sel,</HI> who has but his own Rea&s;on, helped by many &s;ophi&s;ms, for what he &s;ays.</P>
<P>His Error is grounded in the meaning of the Word <HI>Di&s;ciple;</HI> For the Que&s;tion is, <HI>What is in|tended by it in holy Scripture?</HI> Whether it &s;ignify one that is <HI>actually taught,</HI> or whether it intend one that is <HI>devoted to be a Learner,</HI> either by him&s;elf or by another? Dr. <HI>Ru&s;sel</HI> takes it in the <HI>former</HI> &s;en&s;e; But the Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t took it in the <HI>Latter,</HI> as appears, and I believe they knew be&s;t. Howe|ver, it is a poor ca&s;e when men will build their Faith upon the acceptation of a Word, which in u&s;e commonly varys from the <HI>prime</HI> Signification; but that [<HI>Mathetes</HI>] <HI>Di&s;ciple,</HI> need not do, to be taken after one <HI>devoted to be a Learner,</HI> although not yet taught.</P>
<P>But the Antipoedo Bapti&s;ts object, <HI>That this we bring &V;nregenerate Per&s;ons into the Church.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I an&s;wer;</HI></P>
<P><HI>1&s;t.</HI> A Per&s;ons bring a Di&s;ciple does not infer his
<PB N="23" REF="001635_0031_0FB3E247A24C1EF0">Regeneration, compare <HI>John</HI> 6.66. and 1 <HI>John</HI> 2, 19.</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> I think they will not pretend that all whom they baptize are regenerate, yea, doubtle&s;s in ma|ny Congregations the bigge&s;t part are not.</P>
<P><HI>3dly.</HI> What the Mini&s;try can do, is, to bring them into the School of Chri&s;t, and in&s;truct them there; But it is the Spirit of God that &s;anctifies them there, (and has not promi&s;ed to do it any where el&s;e) which he does &s;ome Adult and &s;ome Infants; But neither we, nor &s;uch as baptize only Adult Per&s;ons, know certainly who they are; But we mu&s;t judge charitably of all that we find in the School, till their Works prove them other|wi&s;e, which if they do, before they are baptized, they ought to be refu&s;ed, and if after it, to be di&s;owned, &amp;c. Once more,</P>
<P>Seeing they will have none baptized but &s;uch as are made Di&s;ciples by the Mini&s;try of Men, yea, and by teaching too, <HI>I</HI> would know, how <HI>Annanias</HI> dru&s;t baptize <HI>Paul,</HI> who was not made a Di&s;ciple by the Mini&s;try of Men? If they &s;ay he had a &s;pecial Commis&s;ion, let them &s;hew it, or the account of it, &s;eeing they vaunt &s;o much that they have expre&s;s Scripture for all they do.</P>
<P>Thus far again&s;t Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s &s;econd Argument, and to prove the contrary <HI>viz,</HI> that infants of Believers are &s;o well Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t as their Parents.</P>
<P>But now comes the work which <HI>I</HI> do not love, which is, to an&s;wer his Argument by which he undertakes to prove <HI>this Argument,</HI> Though I have but one Rea&s;on not to Love it, and that is, he has
<PB N="24" REF="001635_0032_0FB3E24921825A98" MS="y">u&s;ed &s;o much Sophi&s;try, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to expo&s;e him in the An&s;wering it, which, <HI>I</HI> fear, will exa&s;perate his Friends, and Anger works no Edification. But why &s;hould they be angry at the di&s;covery of fal&s;e rea&s;ons, for &s;o they will &s;eem to love them</P>
<P>Pag. 23. Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> turns his <HI>Making Di&s;ciples</HI> into <HI>Teaching.</HI> Of which more anon.</P>
<P>In the next page he commits a Fallacy, called, <HI>Petitio principii,</HI> drawing a Conclu&s;ion from a Prin|ciple never allowed, <HI>viz.</HI> That Di&s;ciples can be made no other way than by being actually <HI>Taught.</HI> Which is more commonly the Effect of being Di&s;|ciples, than the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Pag. 25. He &s;hews his skill in expounding of Scripture, telling us, <HI>That the Apo&s;tles were com|manded,</HI> Mark 16.15, 16. <HI>To baptize &s;uch as they had made Di&s;ciples by their Preaching.</HI> Whereas there is not a word of <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> there. <HI>I</HI> grant that our Lord commanded it, as he commanded the bap|tizing of Infants or Adult Per&s;ons, <HI>viz.</HI> by Con|&s;equence. But &s;eeing Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> will not acknow|ledge the one, tho' from as good Con&s;equence, why does he affirm the other, when there is not &s;uch a word in the Text?</P>
<P>Come Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> (to u&s;e his own way) I beg of you, &s;hew me the word [<HI>Di&s;ciple</HI>] there; you &s;ay it, if you do not &s;hew it, the People will think you cannot.</P>
<P>He next tells us, That in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.19. <HI>They were commanded to Baptize &s;uch as they had made</HI> Di&s;ciples <HI>by</HI> Teaching.</P>
<P>But this is wor&s;e, for Con&s;equence will hardly
<PB N="25" REF="001635_0033_0FB3E24AA29CCB48">help you here, <HI>Doctor.</HI> Here he allows Teaching and Making Di&s;ciples to be two things; for the one may be done by the other. And &s;eeing they are Two Things, whereof the one at lea&s;t may be without the other, how can he infer from hence That the word &s;ignifies both? For if <HI>Matheteu&s;ate</HI> here &s;ignifies <HI>Teach ye,</HI> that is all, and [<HI>Make Di&s;|ciples</HI>] is not here; for an Old Di&s;ciple may be Taught, who was not made one by this Teaching; but if it &s;ignifie <HI>Make Di&s;ciples,</HI> that is all, and <HI>Teach</HI> is not here; and if they can be made Di&s;|ciples by other means, they are to Baptize them according to this Commi&s;&s;ion, and that although they were never Taught, notwith&s;tanding this Text, but only they were made Di&s;ciples, in or|der to be Taught.</P>
<P>One word may &s;ignify &s;everal things, but not at one time, but according to what it is u&s;ed for at &s;everal times. You might better have &s;aid, <HI>Make Di&s;ciples</HI> by <HI>Baptizing</HI> them; for both the&s;e words are in the Text, and Bapti&s;m is an Obliga|tion to be a Di&s;ciple; and if it be done by Bapti&s;m it is al&s;o done by the Mini&s;try of Men.</P>
<P>[<HI>Matheteu&s;ate</HI>] <HI>Make Di&s;ciples,</HI> is a Verb, and [<HI>Baptizontes</HI>] <HI>Baptizing,</HI> is a Particle, which are u&s;ually u&s;ed together in the Greek Tongue, to ex|pre&s;s one act; as, [<HI>Apocritheis Eipen</HI>] <HI>An&s;wering, &s;aid.</HI> So, <HI>Make Di&s;ciples, Baptizing,</HI> may refer to one only act. But where is your <HI>Make Di&s;ciples, Teaching,</HI> when there is but one of the words?</P>
<P>Thus he will have [<HI>Matheteu&s;ate</HI>] &s;ignify <HI>Make Di&s;ciples,</HI> when he thinks that will help him (to &s;hut out tho&s;e that God has received.) Then
<PB N="26" REF="001635_0034_0FB3E24CDF874618">again, it mu&s;t &s;ignify <HI>Teach,</HI> when he can improve it be&s;t &s;o. And then he will have it both together, whereas if That be True, it is not in the Commi&s;|&s;ion that Chri&s;ts Mini&s;ters &s;hall preach at all, ex|cept there be &s;ome Unbelievers to hear, and be made Di&s;ciples by it.</P>
<P><HI>Doctor,</HI> do you expound Scripture thus, when you preach to your People?</P>
<P>In the next page, he has another Fallacy, for want of the word <HI>Only</HI> in line 23. For it would not be true to &s;ay, <HI>The Mini&s;tration of the Go&s;pel does</HI> only <HI>inform what is good, and what is evil,</HI> and does nothing el&s;e; and if he &s;ay not this, he had as good &s;ay nothing, except to amu&s;e the ignorant: for there are other things wherein Infants may partake of the Mini&s;tration of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I think any one may &s;ee the Fallacy of &s;uch argu|ing, and learn to avoid &s;uch a Teacher. The Lord pity &s;uch as build their Faith on &s;uch Con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>I have not Room to enlarge upon his &s;hufling off Mr <HI>Chandlers</HI> Di&s;tinction which &s;o hurt him, and &s;everal other things. It &s;eems his &s;ure&s;t way of an&s;wering, to come off with honour, was, to evade it, and &s;o he, as it were, forcibly proceeds to another Argument, leaving <HI>this,</HI> with that which is well if &s;ome do not &s;ay is a <HI>Lye;</HI> for he &s;aith, That <HI>Mr.</HI> Chandler <HI>had granted every part of his Argument,</HI> when his own Narrative does not tell us (that I can find) any more that was granted than <HI>That Infants cannot be compleat Di&s;ciples, becau&s;e they know not good and evil,</HI> which I know not that ever any denyed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>On Dr.</HI> Ru&s;&s;el<HI>'s Third and Fourth Arguments, pag.</HI> 29.</HEAD>
<P>HIs Third Aargument is, That <HI>the Apo&s;tle</HI> Paul <HI>did declare all the Coun&s;el of God,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and yet did never declare Infants Bapti&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>This were &s;omething, if he could prove it, but which way can that be done, except we had all the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI>'s Sermons, that ever he taught? Therefore his bringing this is Ridiculous, and the de&s;ign of it is altogether a Sophi&s;m, as appears by his way of proving it.</P>
<P>However, his argument is not true, and I prove the contrary of it, thus.</P>
<P>All the Coun&s;el of God, with re&s;pect to our Faith and Practice, was taught by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P>But all the Commi&s;&s;ion for Bapti&s;m, is a part of of the Coun&s;el of God in that re&s;pect.</P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> all the Commi&s;&s;ion for Bapti&s;m was taught by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul.</HI> Hence,</P>
<P>If the Commis&s;ion for Bapti&s;m includes Infants, the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> taught Infants Bapti&s;m,</P>
<P>But the Commis&s;ion for Bapti&s;m includes in|fants.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="001635_0036_0FB3E24FED3BFC90">
<HI>Ergo,</HI> The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> taught Infant Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>The Minor, which only can be objected again&s;t, <HI>I</HI> have proved before.</P>
<P>But to return to Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> p. 30.</P>
<P>His next arguement to prove his Third by, is both fal&s;e in it &s;elf, and the Fallacy, called, <HI>The begging of a Principle,</HI> except all <HI>Pauls</HI> Sermons were written in the New Te&s;tament; But he is &s;till a good help to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> for by the &s;ame Argu|ment <HI>Bapti&s;m with Water</HI> may be denyed, if it be not written in the New Te&s;tament, that the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> taught it, and I think it was for &s;uch Rea&s;ons that a <HI>Palagian Quaker</HI> here was &s;o forward to have it Re-printed. And by the &s;ame Rule we may deny that Buggery is a Sin, or for a Man to marry his Si&s;ter or his Daughter, if it be not writ|ten in the New Te&s;tament that <HI>Paul</HI> taught that it is.</P>
<P>In page 23. he very Uncivilly Scoffs at Mr. <HI>Leigh's</HI> Simile, and yet &s;eems as if he were in Sober Earne&s;t.</P>
<P>The following pages are almo&s;t full with his words, but I cannot &s;ee with what de&s;ign, except to amu&s;e the ignorant who judge of a Di&s;pute only by the many Words, Scoffs and Triumphs u&s;ed by the Di&s;putant. And I fear too many of his Pro|&s;elytes are won by no other means.</P>
<P>As for in&s;tance. In the end of the <HI>page</HI> 33, to prove that all that <HI>Paul</HI> taught is recorded in the Scripture, he cites <HI>Acts</HI> 20.27. <HI>I have not &s;hunned to declare to you all the Coun&s;el of God.</HI> Admirable Interpreter of Scripture! What is this at all to the purpo&s;e? If it had been, <HI>I have not &s;hunned
<PB N="29" REF="001635_0037_0FB3E251871D80B0" MS="y">to write in my Epi&s;tles all the Coun&s;el of God,</HI> it had been &s;omething to his purpo&s;e. All the re&s;t of his di&s;cour&s;e on this Argument is of the &s;ame Stamp. But <HI>I</HI> preceive his admirers think he has proved all he &s;aid <HI>effectually.</HI> The Lord pity them and all that are taught by &s;uch as can own &s;uch Arguments! if they apply Scripture <HI>thus</HI> al&s;o, when they teach the &s;piritual part of Religion.</P>
<P>Page 58. Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> in his remark &s;ince the Di&s;|pute, tells us a ridiculous &s;tory of a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Mini&s;ter preaching about the Eunuchs Wife and Children. Though I do not believe &s;o ignorant a Creature was ever approved by a <HI>Presbytrey</HI> to be a Mini&s;ter, nor hath he recited all Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI>'s words there. But I hope now that this party will not be angry if I tell them I have heard of an <HI>Antipedo-Bapti&s;t</HI> preacher, of a great Name among &s;ome of them, who, preaching, how Chri&s;t <HI>being rich, be|came Poor for our &s;akes,</HI> among other things, &s;aid, <HI>That he parted with his Eternity.</HI> Some call it Bla&s;phe|my: And that &s;ome well approved Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Antipedobapti&s;ts</HI> interpret that in <HI>Luke</HI> 10.33. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the <HI>Samaritan</HI> to be our Saviour, the Ho&s;t to be the Holy Gho&s;t, the Two Pence to be Grace and Glory, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And that Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> (if he &s;peak &s;ence, and it were an affront to &s;ay he does not) infers from <HI>Acts</HI> 20.27. <HI>That the Scripture contains a Record of all that</HI> Paul <HI>taught,</HI> that is, that <HI>all</HI> Paul<HI>'s Sermons are at large recorded in the New Te&s;ta|ment,</HI> if he &s;peaks to the purpo&s;e. I think this is as bad as the Eunuchs Wife and Children; and if this be not enough, we &s;hall have more before the Di&s;pute clo&s;es the fir&s;t Que&s;tion. and I think this
<PB N="30" REF="001635_0038_0FB3E252F768C8B0">may the better be remembred of Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> becau&s;e of what he &s;ays in plain words from a &s;aying of Mr. <HI>Leighs, viz.</HI></P>
<P>In pag. 36. Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> tells his Reader, <HI>That the&s;e Men have the confidence to affirm before &s;o great an Auditory that is written in the Commi&s;&s;ion that</HI> Paul <HI>did declare the Bapti&s;m of Infants to be a Go&s;pel In&s;titution.</HI> What &s;hall we call this? Let the Reader view Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;els</HI> own Narrative, and &s;ee if he can find &s;uch a word, or any thing more that Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> &s;aid, <HI>I will &s;ay it is in the Commi&s;&s;ion, ALL NATIONS,</HI> which is as much to as &s;ay, <HI>As</HI> Paul <HI>taught all the Coun&s;el of</HI> God, <HI>&s;o he taught Infant Bapti&s;m, which is in the Commi&s;&s;ion implyed in the&s;e words, ALL NA|TIONS, although there be no other account of it.</HI> I will not plead the &s;ufficiency of that argument; But what is this to affirming that it is written in the Commi&s;&s;ion that <HI>Paul</HI> taught it? Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> can make &s;uch <HI>long</HI> Con&s;equences on a Mans words, and &s;ay the Man affirmed &s;o. It is &s;trange that he cannot take up with a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence, that the Commi&s;&s;ion implies Infants; Yea, with the Hundredth part of the Con&s;equence, that there is for it, he may as well &s;ay Infants are expre&s;&s;ed in the Commi&s;&s;ion, as to &s;ay, that Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> thus affirmed; But he a&s;cribes it to them all, &s;aying <HI>The&s;e Men.</HI> But in Truth Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> did not &s;ay, <HI>it was written there,</HI> much le&s;s affirm it, except to &s;ay <HI>All Nations,</HI> be to &s;ay, <HI>Paul taught,</HI> &amp;c. I mu&s;t not remark upon it!</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, from one Argument to another, he has the la&s;t word, without being contradicted, <HI>That his Argument &s;tands good.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="001635_0039_0FB3E2546CFDEDD8">
The&s;e things con&s;idered, with Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI>'s granting every part of his &s;econd Argument, and what he tells his Reader here, and &s;ome other things, do &s;erve me for an eight Rea&s;on mentioned in my fir&s;t Chapter.</P>
<P>And I cannot but take Notice, how he that in his Dedication, tells, how ready he is to &s;uffer for Chri&s;t, does joyn with it &s;o much Con&s;cience of &s;peaking the Truth, and u&s;ing no Fallacious Argu|ments, nor &s;triving for Ma&s;tery, but only &s;incerely for the Truth, without &s;triving to hide his Re|&s;pondents Arguments, which things the love of Chri&s;t obliges, &s;o well as to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>His Fourth Argument, pag. 39. is, <HI>Chri&s;ts Com|mi&s;&s;ion doth &s;hew who are to be Baptized,</HI></P>
<P><HI>But it doth not &s;hew, that Infants are to be Bap|tized.</HI> Ergo.</P>
<P>This is a Fallacy all over, which he u&s;ed in other words, on his fir&s;t Argument, and I have an&s;wered it in the beginning of my &s;econd Chap|ter.</P>
<P>And by this Argument I can as well prove, that Dr. <HI>Ru&s;sel</HI> has no power to Baptize. Thus,</P>
<P>Chri&s;ts Commi&s;&s;ion doth &s;hew us who are to Baptize,</P>
<P>But it doth not &s;hew us that Dr. Ru&s;&s;el is to baptize any,</P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> Dr. Ru&s;&s;el is not to Baptize, according to Chri&s;ts Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If he &s;ay, The Commi&s;&s;ion &s;hews it by Con&s;e|quence, he mu&s;t then acknowledge his Argument a Fallacy. For if the Commi&s;&s;ion &s;hews it by Con&s;equence, it &s;hews it. And let him know,
<PB N="32" REF="001635_0040_0FB3E255E6B03878">that the Commi&s;&s;ion expre&s;&s;es <HI>Believers,</HI> and that the Scripture calls &s;ome <HI>Infants</HI> Believers; but it does not call Dr. Ru&s;&s;el a Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Now, I having already an&s;wered all he &s;ays on this Argument, need not trouble the Reader fur|ther, only it is worth Noticing again, how &s;trenu|ou&s;ly he pre&s;&s;es for Infants to be <HI>Expre&s;sed,</HI> or not baptized, although he allowed, or pretended to allow of Con&s;equence, at fir&s;t. And &s;eeing he pre&s;&s;es &s;o hard for <HI>Expre&s;s Scripture,</HI> I Challenge him to bring Expre&s;s Scripture for <HI>Making Di&s;ciples by Teaching,</HI> which is his ground Work here.</P>
<P>Come, <HI>Doctor,</HI> You make a great Triumph, when you demand of your Re&s;pondents <HI>Expre&s;s Scripture</HI> for that which they do not pretend to prove, but by <HI>Con&s;equence,</HI> Where is your <HI>Expre&s;s Scripture</HI> that &s;ays, <HI>Make Di&s;ciples by Teaching?</HI> &s;eeing you pretend to have Expre&s;s Scripture for all you do. And where is it written, That they cannot be made any other way?</P>
<P>If what I have &s;aid be not enough, I add, If the <HI>Anti-Paedo-Bapti&s;ts,</HI> to prove making Di&s;ciples by Teaching, plead <HI>Mat</HI> 28.20. <HI>Teaching them, &amp;c.</HI> I will, for once, allow it; but then let them re|member, That by the &s;ame Rule they are fir&s;t to be made Di&s;ciples by <HI>Baptizing, v.</HI> 19. And if I &s;hould undertake to prove, that in Scripture ac|count, None are regularly Di&s;ciples till baptized, and that all &s;uch are, except by their Works they cut them&s;elves off again; and that to be vi&s;ibly a Di&s;ciple, or vi&s;ibly a Church-Member, or to live under the ordinary appointed Means for Salva|tion, or to be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, in Covenant with God, is
<PB N="33" REF="001635_0041_0FB3E2576043EEF8" MS="y">all one thing; I think they would not ea&s;ily find it Confuted.</P>
<P>And hence, the Faith, that in the Commi&s;&s;ion, is a Qualification for Bapti&s;m (if believing be there named as a Qualification) is joyned with the Promi&s;e of Salvation; and if I affirm, that all that are vi&s;ibly Subjects of that Promi&s;e, and no other, are the Subjects of Bapti&s;m, according to the Commi&s;&s;ion, I think they will not ea&s;ily find it Confuted.</P>
<P>I further add, If the Apo&s;tles had left out <HI>Infants,</HI> the <HI>Judaizing Chri&s;tians</HI> would have more &s;trenuou&s;ly Oppo&s;ed them for that, than they did for leaving out Circmuci&s;ion, the Ceremonial Law, the yearly Fea&s;t-days, and Change of the Sabbath-day.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Judaizing Chri&s;tians</HI> did not Oppo&s;e them for leaving out Infants, <HI>Ergo,</HI> The Apo|&s;tles did not leave out Infants.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews,</HI> who took &s;uch great Satisfaction in having their Children in Covenant, with them|&s;elves, and in their receiving the Ordinance of being received into the Covenant, would not have &s;ilently left out their Children, and &s;et them upon equal Terms with the Children of the <HI>Heathen,</HI> and make no Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Now, from time to time, as we have the account of their Oppo&s;ing the Apo&s;tles for leaving out Circumci&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and of the Apo&s;tles vindication of their &s;o doing, there is never one title of the leaving out of infants, or of the <HI>Judaizing Chri|&s;tians</HI> pleading for their being in the Covenant, or the Apo&s;tles pleading again&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="001635_0042_0FB3E258ED600EF0">
And when the &s;cripture gives us the Account of the Oppo&s;ition of the&s;e <HI>Judaizing Chri&s;tians,</HI> &s;o often and full, it is not rational to think it would have been &s;ilent in this, which would have been the greate&s;t part of their Oppo&s;ition, if Infants had not been &s;till partakers of the Sign of entring into the Church or Covenant, &s;o well as formerly.</P>
<P>The only Objection the <HI>Anti-Pedo-Bapti&s;ts</HI> make, that has the colour of rea&s;on in it, is, <HI>That thus People are brought into the Church by natural Genera|tion, and not by Regeneration.</HI> To which <HI>I an&s;wer:</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t.</HI> the baptizing them, is an acknowledgment, that they cannot be &s;aved without Regeneration; but &s;uch as deny them bapti&s;m, have no &s;uch &s;ign, and yet believe they are &s;aved.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly,</HI> It is not their natural Generation, but their being under the care of &s;uch Parents or Ma|&s;ters as will bring them up under the ordinary ap|pointed means for Salvation, which entitles them to Bapti&s;m; for &s;o was the Covenant with Father <HI>Abraham;</HI> And to be under the ordinary appointed means, is to be under a Conditional Promi&s;e, and &s;o in Covenant, which is to be a Church-Member or Di&s;ciple. So this Objection is fal&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>On Mr.</HI> Williams <HI>his Arguments, and the Re&s;t of their Di&s;pute on this Que&s;tion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>PAg. 54. <HI>I</HI> find nothing, but what is an&s;wered already till we come to what the Doctor helps after the Di&s;pute. It is his perverting that Scripture, Rom. 10.14. <HI>How &s;hall they believe in him of whom they have not heard, &amp;c.</HI> which Text refers only to &s;uch as can actually <HI>Call upon the Name of the Lord.</HI> But if this Text concerns Infants, we may as well infer, that they cannot be &s;aved, be|cau&s;e they call not on the Name of the Lord, as that they cannot believe, becau&s;e they cannot hear with under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>His next Argument, <HI>That a Mini&s;ter mu&s;t have an account of a per&s;ons Faith, before he baptize him,</HI> is an&s;wered already. <HI>I</HI> now add, that we have no way to know an Adult Per&s;ons Faith, but by his Profe&s;sion and Practice; But the Faith of Infants is known from a better Te&s;timony, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Holy Scripture, as has been &s;hewed.</P>
<P>And his next following pag. 60. Of <HI>Self-denyal being nece&s;&s;ary to make a Di&s;ciple</HI> is of the &s;ame nature. The real de&s;ign of that Scripture, <HI>Luke</HI> 14.27. and other like, is, to &s;hew us that fal&s;e Di&s;ciples cannot be &s;aved; altho they be vi&s;ible Di&s;ciples they &s;hall not be accepted as true Di&s;ciples, even
<PB N="36" REF="001635_0044_0FB3E25BDF64E938">all &s;uch as will not deny them&s;elves for Chri&s;t. In the &s;ame &s;ence we read Rom. 2. leter end, <HI>That is not Circumci&s;ion which is outward in the Fle&s;h,</HI> &amp;c. So Rom. 9.6. <HI>They are not all</HI> I&s;rael <HI>who are of</HI> I&s;rael. So, if it be rational to apply this Scripture to In|fants, the inference mu&s;t be, That they are all Damned who dye in Infancy. <HI>Judas</HI> was a Di&s;ci|ple, if the Scripture &s;ay true, and yet this Cur&s;e came upon him, becau&s;e he had not the Grace of Self-denyal, but loved the <HI>Reward of &V;nrighteou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI> But how Unrea&s;onable is it to apply to In|fants the Cur&s;es which belong only to grown Hypocrites, who for want of Self-denyal follow their Lu&s;ts, which Infants do not! That this is the de&s;ign of &s;uch Scriptures, deny if you can. And for what Rea&s;on mu&s;t they be kept out of the Church, for that which will not keep them out of Heaven? A&s;&s;ign a Rea&s;on from Scripture he that can. And why, &s;eeing they own that Infants have the ble&s;&s;ing of Di&s;ciples in their Salvation, how Unrea&s;onable is it to apply to them the Cur&s;es that are intended only for Hypocrites! How the&s;e People under&s;tand the Scripture! If they under|&s;tand it thus in all things, it is time for all &s;uch as love their Souls to be weary of them. I know they would take it very heniou&s;ly if one &s;hould &s;ay of them, <HI>when the blind lead the blind, both fall into the Ditch.</HI> But <HI>I</HI> hope Gods Mercy does prevail above &s;ome of their ignorance, for I think <HI>I</HI> know &s;ome good men of their Profe&s;sion, at lea&s;t of one fort of them.</P>
<P>But <HI>I</HI> mu&s;t ob&s;erve, how readily they turn it off, as not to concern Infants, when &s;uch Scriptures,
<PB N="37" REF="001635_0045_0FB3E25D6D1A3BF0">as, <HI>He that believeth not &s;hall be damned,</HI> is alledged for Infants Faith; but how they take all that they can pervert again&s;t it, although never &s;o forreign to the purpo&s;e. <HI>I</HI> would know, by what Rule they do it, except it be that of <HI>Re&s;olving to &s;ee with but one Eye, although God has given them two?</HI> And by what Rule the&s;e &s;criptures concern Infants more than that?</P>
<P>Next comes in Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> again, with his old and common Sophi&s;m, <HI>Denying that ever the Apo&s;tles baptized any Infant, demanding an In&s;tance that they did.</HI></P>
<P>But if that be a Rule, we may deny that ever they gave the Lords &s;upper to <HI>Women,</HI> or Prayed, when they met on the Lords Day, to Preach, &amp;c. and many other things; for all their Acts are not Recorded; It is enough that they had Commi&s;&s;ion &s;o to do.</P>
<P>But here lies the &s;trength of his fallacy, In &s;tead of arguing, <HI>If they did, there is &s;ome account of it in &s;cripture,</HI> he leaps over that to prove there is no ac|count of it, and &s;o might ea&s;ily ground his Re|&s;pondent, and blind the ignorant, and yet has proved nothing.</P>
<P>Page. 64. Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> an&s;wers him well, by de|manding an In&s;tance of <HI>one born of a believing Pa|rent that was baptized at age.</HI> But he omitting to in&s;ert (<HI>after Bapti&s;m</HI> was in&s;tituted) Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> p 66. takes the advantage of it, to In&s;tance our Saviour; Which proves as much as to In&s;tance, <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> circumci&s;ed at thirteen years old, would prove that Infants were not to be circumci&s;ed at eight days old, when Circumci&s;ion was not in&s;ti|tuted
<PB N="38" REF="001635_0046_0FB3E25EE8CA46A8">before he came to that age. And the Reve|rend Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> approves it as a <HI>pertinent An&s;wer,</HI> and &s;o do his friends, as one of the greate&s;t Ex|ploits they had performed; and Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> is &s;o plea&s;ed with that Opinion, as to publi&s;h it in his Dedication. Indeed, it will &s;erve a Sophi&s;ter very well, who has no regard to Truth nor Con&s;cience, but only to carry the Cau&s;e right or wrong.</P>
<P>Me thinks this &s;hould make Con&s;cientious People weary of them, I could not have believed it of them, if I had not &s;een it in their own works, &s;o much admired by their Party here. If I hadbeen half per&s;waded to be of their Opinion, I think &s;uch things would have made me Sick of them; For if their Opinion could be true, it is as clear as the &s;hining of the Sun, that they are &s;atisfied in it by fal&s;e Arguments; and I know not of one true Argument they u&s;e, having al&s;o read and well per|u&s;ed Mr. <HI>Keache's Rector rectified.</HI></P>
<P>A Child may know, that neither Adult nor Infants &s;hould be baptized before Bapti&s;m was in|&s;tituted, be they who&s;e Children they will. And <HI>I</HI> do &s;ay, that, till they give an In&s;tance, as the Que&s;tion &s;hould be &s;tated, Mr. <HI>Leigh's</HI> Argument is as good again&s;t them, as theirs again&s;t him, and a little better, becau&s;e we read of &s;everal housholds baptized, though Infants be not expre&s;&s;ed in them.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el's</HI> In&s;tances, p. 65, of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> and others, are not &s;criptural, and therefore not to the Que&s;tion, neither were the&s;e baptized by the Apo&s;tles, but long after.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t remember, that many Chri&s;tians in tho&s;e times had a fancy that Bapti&s;m clean&s;ed
<PB N="39" REF="001635_0047_0FB3E26069484878" MS="y">them from all Sins pa&s;t, but from none that were committed after, and therefore many inclined to have their Bapti&s;m deferred till ju&s;t before their Death. And as for <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> his Father was a <HI>Pagan</HI> till <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> was con&s;iderably grown, and being a <HI>Great Prince,</HI> and his Wife of the Nation of the <HI>Tributary Britains,</HI> it is rational to conclude, that he would not &s;uffer him to be baptized in his Infancy. And moreover (if I mi&s;take not) <HI>Con|&s;tantine</HI> had a great de&s;ire to be baptized over the &s;epulchre of our Saviour, and &s;o deferred it long, but how that could be done by plunging, I cannot tell.</P>
<P>Next, follows Mr. <HI>Leigh's</HI> Opponency, pag. 67. where Dr. <HI>Ru&s;sel</HI> mannages his skill again into Sophi&s;try, by not con&s;idering the Di&s;tinction be|tween Church Members <HI>de jure, of right,</HI> and <HI>de facto, in fact.</HI> Baptized per&s;ons, till excommuni|cated, are Church-Members, and di&s;ciples <HI>de facto.</HI> But its only &s;anctified Believers (bapti|zed or not baptized) are &s;o <HI>de Jure.</HI></P>
<P>His an&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Leighs</HI> Induction, is al&s;o like the re&s;t. <HI>I</HI> pa&s;s by his Language, though as good a Gentleman as him&s;elf, and ob&s;erve his addition &s;ince the di&s;pute, when there was none to an&s;wer him, where he makes his Reader believe that which Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> never &s;aid; For Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> denies that Infants are the <HI>Graces of the Kingdom</HI> or the <HI>Glory of the Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Heaven;</HI> and Dr. <HI>Ru&s;sel</HI> will &s;eem to under&s;tand it, <HI>That they have no Interest in them;</HI> whereas a Child may know, that, <HI>to be a thing,</HI> and <HI>to have a right in a thing,</HI> are &s;o far from being the &s;ame, that they are quite Oppo&s;ite. And &s;o
<PB N="40" REF="001635_0048_0FB3E261F86A2768" MS="y">he ca&s;ts a &s;coff upon Mr. <HI>Leigh,</HI> for what he did not &s;ay, and &s;eems to deny, but does not deny Mr. <HI>Leighs</HI> Argument. Indeed it will do to amu&s;e the Ignorant, and help to lead the blind Captive. <HI>I</HI> am weary of this, and &s;orry that I mu&s;t expo&s;e Men that profe&s;s Religon, to defend the Truth that &s;uffers, and to defend tho&s;e that they unju&s;tly expo&s;ed. If I could but find fair Arguments mode&s;tly managed, to an&s;wer, it were a more grateful work. And if the&s;e Men that quietly an|&s;wered him, mu&s;t be &s;o repre&s;ented, how &s;hall <HI>I</HI> e&s;cape, who expo&s;e their unfair dealing, &amp;c.? I would not do it, if I dur&s;t omit it, for fear of the La&s;h of their Tongues, e&s;pecially when they find that they cannot an&s;wer me any other way, though <HI>I</HI> encourage my &s;elf, that &s;uch of them as are good men, will not reproach me for my love to them; for if <HI>I</HI> could have found a way to clear the Truth from fal&s;e arguments, without accu&s;ing them of Sophi&s;try, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they &s;hould not have found that, nor any other word to gall them. And <HI>I</HI> comfort my &s;elf, that if I &s;uffer Reproach for doing that, which I am bound in Con&s;cience to do, it will not turn to my lo&s;s. However, <HI>I</HI> hope that the fence of my Duty to my Maker will keep me from fearing them, &s;o as to de&s;i&s;t, and I am willing to leave it to wi&s;e indifferent men to judge; and if I have wronged them, they &s;hall have &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> his Opp&s;iote Argu|ment, I deny. For if Infants are not members of the Univer&s;al Church, I know not how they can be fit for Heaven when they dye.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="001635_0049_0FB3E2636E596EC8">
And his reply to Mr. <HI>Robin&s;ons</HI> demand of <HI>an ex|pre&s;s Prohibition of Infants Church-member&s;hip,</HI> will not do in this ca&s;e. For, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> we in&s;i&s;t upon Scrip|ture-Con&s;equence for it, which if it be overthrown it mu&s;t be by expre&s;s Scripture, or overturning our Con&s;equence; But the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> do not pretend Scripture (that I know of) for u&s;ing <HI>Cream</HI> and <HI>Spittle</HI> in Bapti&s;m. 2<HI>dly,</HI> We have expre&s;s Scripture that has taken Infants into the Church, and we ex|pect that they may not be turned out again, with|out expre&s;s Scripture. If the <HI>Anti-Pedo-Bapti&s;ts</HI> have the power, we would be very glad to &s;ee their Commi&s;&s;ion, and to know what Offence the poor Infants have committed that they mu&s;t be ca&s;t out of the Church, when they were Promi&s;ed to have a right in it to all Generations.</P>
<P>It &s;eems &s;trange, that Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> could not pro|duce Scripture for turning Wicked per&s;ons out of the Church, p. 73. but they &s;ay it.</P>
<P>Pag. 74. Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> unasked, acknowledges, That <HI>Infants have a Title to Grace here.</HI> I would know how this can be reconciled, with their ha|ving no Faith, and which way their Grace &s;hall be exerci&s;ed without Faith? Or, if it can be in <HI>Habit</HI> only, why Faith may not al&s;o? But to have other Graces, and no Faith, &s;eems to me like a Tree growing up and &s;tanding without Roots. I think all <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> call Faith the Radical Grace. How can one love, or fear, or hope in, or de&s;ire that which he believes nothing of, &amp;c? If there be the Habit of one, I think of the other nece&s;&s;arily; But let Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> with his <HI>expre&s;s Scripture,</HI> &s;hew, why a Root of Faith may not as well be in them

<PB N="42" REF="001635_0050_0FB3E2654322A0A8">as of other Graces? Yea, let him do it by Con&s;e|quence, and in the mean time, I beg of him and his friends, to con&s;ider it well and Con&s;cientiou&s;ly, le&s;t they be found &s;uch as re&s;i&s;t the evidence of Truth, again&s;t their own Con&s;cience. Or does he mean Grace after Death? No, for it is Grace <HI>here</HI> and Glory hereafter; be&s;ide, that mu&s;t infer Re|generation after Death, which I cannot think he believes. Or by Grace does he mean only <HI>Temporal Comfort,</HI> &s;uch Grace as the Bea&s;ts have?</P>
<P>He &s;ays, this is <HI>by Chri&s;ts Righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed</HI> to them, and when he brings Scripture to prove. that <HI>Chri&s;ts Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is imputed to &s;uch as have no Faith, we will bring Scripture to Baptize them. I may not enlarge to &s;hew how he interprets <HI>Acts</HI> 15. (p. 75.) nor how he pleads that the <HI>Manner</HI> of Cir|cumci&s;&s;ion was the thing there in debate, and &s;ays, The <HI>Manner of</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>was to cut off the fore-&s;kin,</HI> &amp;c, as if the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> had u&s;ed Circumci&s;&s;ion, but in another manner, and many more &s;uch things. However I will not undertake to prove infants Di&s;ciple&s;hip from <HI>that</HI> Scripture, till I can do it by a Syllogi&s;m, which (according to Rule) &s;hall have no Fallacy in it.</P>
<P>He &s;ays <HI>they</HI> (his Opponents) <HI>know, that the Churches in tho&s;e times con&s;i&s;ted of Adult per&s;ons.</HI> If he had &s;aid, <HI>Only Adult, I</HI> would have &s;aid &s;omething to him.

So they may have a Title to Glory in Heaven, and be the Brethren of our Lord and Saviour, who calls &s;uch <HI>Brethren,</HI> and
<PB N="43" REF="001635_0051_0FB3E266B3D921E0">yet (it &s;eems) not good enough to be Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;els</HI> Brethren.</P>
<P>Further on, pag. 77. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> vertually denys their having received the <HI>Ho'y Gho&s;t.</HI> But how this will agree with his Brother <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> who &s;ays, <HI>They have a Title to Grace here</HI> (Or are they cheat|ed of their Title, and never have the thing) or with his own a&s;&s;ertion, That <HI>Chri&s;ts Righteou&s;ne&s;s is imputed to them,</HI> and not his Spirit given, I cannot under&s;tand, e&s;pecially &s;eeing the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> whom I have a greater e&s;teem of, &s;ays, (<HI>Rom.</HI> 8.9.) <HI>If any Man have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his.</HI> The Greek [<HI>'Tis</HI>] <HI>any Man,</HI> is as applicable to Infants, as men. If they have Grace without the Spirit, I think it is not of Gods making, and &s;o they had better be without it. However, I believe they cannot go to Heaven till they have received the Holy Spirit here in this Life, and I believe the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> under&s;tood him&s;elf very well, when he &s;aid, <HI>Who can forbid Watter, that the&s;e may be bap|tized who have received the Holy Go&s;t &s;o well as we.</HI> And I pray the&s;e People to con&s;ider it, and I pray God to give them a heart to do it. They have need to believe &s;omething that will con&s;i&s;t toge|ther.</P>
<P>Soon after, how &s;incerely does Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> beg of them for an in&s;tance of infants Bapti&s;m? Poor Man! how he longed for, it when he knew they did not pretend to prove it that way. But could they have found, &amp; had the Con&s;cience to bring a like In|&s;tance to theirs, for a Child of a Believer baptized at age, <HI>I</HI> wonder if they would not have made a great cry of the Fallacy.</P>

Next follows, after a few more of Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;els</HI> Re|marks and Syllogi&s;ms, a great blu&s;ter about making Di&s;ciples of Bea&s;ts, which is about as rea&s;onable as many other of their arguing. For.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Infants</HI> have immortal Souls, <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> have not.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Infants</HI> are coming on to the u&s;e of Rea&s;on, <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> not.</P>
<P N="3">3. If we may believe <HI>Dr. Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> infants have a Title of <HI>Grace here, i. e.</HI> Grace while Infants, <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> have not.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Infants</HI> have a fair advantage for their Salva|tion by the in&s;truction they &s;hall have meerly by vertue of their Parents Di&s;ciple&s;hip, <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> have not.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Lord adds to the Church &s;uch as &s;hall be &s;aved, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.47. <HI>Infants</HI> are &s;uch as &s;hall be &s;aved, <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> are not.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Infants</HI> of believing Parents, brought under the Covenant-Promi&s;e, have this <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> as effec|tual a means for them, as <HI>Deligent hearing</HI> is for their Parents, who have no other Title by it but Gods promi&s;e, <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> have not.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Infants</HI> have Faith, Bea&s;ts have not.</P>
<P N="8">8. Infants have the Spirit of Chri&s;t, el&s;e they are none of his, <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> have not.</P>

<P N="10">10. <HI>Infants</HI> are devoted to be Learners of Chri&s;t, which is to be his Di&s;ciples, <HI>Bea&s;ts are not.</HI></P>
<P>But perhaps Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> will here (as he often does) plead, That the&s;e things are not according to his Argument, for he &s;ays, <HI>Made Di&s;ciplis by Teach|ing.</HI></P>

<P N="1"><HI>1st.</HI> If his Argument be not true, what then? For though I acknowledge grown Di&s;ciples are made and edified by Teaching, and not without, yet I deny that the Commi&s;&s;ion for Bapti&s;m obliges only &s;uch to be baptized who are &s;o made, as I have &s;ufficiently &s;hown; and his Argument is wholly a <HI>begging of a Principle:</HI> And &s;o long as our Saviour owns them for Di&s;ciples, I am not &s;o much concern|ed how Dr. <HI>Ru&s;</HI> accounts them; But I de&s;ire him to &s;hew me the Rule by which our Saviour has requi|red the Bapti&s;m of &s;ome Di&s;ciples, and not others.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Containing &s;ome further Arguments for Infant Bapti&s;m.</HEAD>
<P><HI>FIr&s;t,</HI> Bapti&s;m is the &s;ign of the ble&s;&s;ing of the Covenant of Grace.</P>
<P>To all tho&s;e to whom the Grace &s;ignified be|longs, the &s;ign belongs.</P>
<P>But to Infants the Grace &s;ignified belongs.</P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> To Infants the &s;ign belongs.</P>
<P>We find Bapti&s;m given as a &s;ign of the ble&s;&s;ings of the Covenant of Grace, &s;uch as the <HI>Remi&s;&s;ion of fins, Clean&s;ing from &s;in, the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. Now if Infants be in the Covenant of Grace, they have the&s;e and &s;uch like ble&s;&s;ings, &s;o well as the Adult. And if they can give a Rea&s;on, from Scripture, to give the &s;ign to &s;ome, and not to others, who have as good a right in the things &s;ignified, let us &s;ee it, le&s;t we accu&s;e them of an <HI>&V;n&s;criptural Practice</HI> in making a difference, where God has made none. But if they deny Infants to have the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings repre&s;ented in Bapti&s;m, then <HI>Away</HI> with their pretended belief of Infants Grace here, and Glory hereafter, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 2. A Law made, &s;tands good till repealed.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e taken into Covenant by a Law unrepea|led, are in Covenant &s;till.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="001635_0055_0FB3E26EB37E6368">
But Infants are taken into Covenant by a Law unrepealed.</P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> Infants are in Covenant &s;till.</P>
<P>I know they object, That <HI>the Circumci&s;ion Law of</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>is Repealed.</HI> But the Covenant with <HI>Abra|ham</HI> was a Go&s;pel Covenant, and <HI>I</HI> hope they will not &s;ay <HI>that</HI> is repealed, though Circumci&s;ion, the &s;ign, be repealed, becau&s;e the Blood of the Redee|mer, promi&s;ed in the Covenant, has been &s;hed; for, what is performed, is no longer a Promi&s;e, yet the Covenant in the remaining part is the &s;ame &s;till, &s;ee <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. v. 11. to 16. This was not a Co|venant of the <HI>Law to</HI> Abraham <HI>and his &s;eed,</HI> but it was <HI>through the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith,</HI> v. 13. there|fore a Go&s;pel Covenant. It was not <HI>only</HI> the Pro|mi&s;e of the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> notwith&s;tanding what Mr. <HI>Keach</HI> &s;ays, for that was only to the Circum|ci&s;ed &s;eed of <HI>Abraham;</HI> but this Promi&s;e was to the <HI>&V;ncircumci&s;ed</HI> al&s;o, <HI>v.</HI> 11. <HI>i. e.</HI> it was to remain, when Circumci&s;ion is aboli&s;hed. <HI>Abraham</HI> was to be <HI>Heir of the World,</HI> v.13. The Uncircumci&s;ed <HI>Gentile Church,</HI> and not the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> only, were to come into his Covenant; Yea, it is expre&s;s, <HI>v.</HI>16. <HI>Therefore it is of Faith, that it might be by Grace, to the end the Promi&s;e might be &s;ure to all the &s;eed, not to that only which is of the Law, but to that al&s;o which is of the Faith of</HI> Abraham, <HI>who is the Father of us all,</HI> Thus it was a Go&s;pel Covenant, to remain for|ever. And becau&s;e we are brought into it, he is called, <HI>The Father of us all,</HI> not our &s;piritual Father, except he were the In&s;trument of our Conver&s;ion, but the Man with whom a formal Covenant was made, not only for him&s;elf, but for all that &s;hould
<PB N="48" REF="001635_0056_0FB3E27030C3E300">come into it; and this Covenant includes the <HI>Co|venanter</HI> and his &s;eed, and it contains the whole Go&s;pel of Salvation by Faith in Chri&s;t, who was promi&s;ed in it. Now this Covenant was a Cove|nant of <HI>Faith</HI> with <HI>Abraham,</HI> and his Infant &s;eed included in it, had no more Faith than ours have. His &s;eed that lived to grow up might loo&s;e the Ble&s;&s;ings of it by tran&s;gres&s;ing the Conditions be|fore they had obtained the covenanted &s;aving Grace, and &s;o may ours, and &s;o may an Adult per|&s;on, received in by Di&s;ciple&s;hip, but not yet fully regenerate. Now this Covenant being the Con|&s;titution of the vi&s;ible Go&s;pel Church, all that are included in it, are Church Members and Di&s;ci|ples. Now that which was legal, as Circumci&s;ion, is expre&s;sly repealed, but the &s;ame Covenant is &s;till of as good force after <HI>that</HI> is repealed. This covenant made with <HI>Abraham</HI> was <HI>not</HI> repealed in St. <HI>Pauls</HI> time, and we believe it never was &s;ince. If the [<HI>Antipedobapsi&s;ts</HI>] &s;ay, it is, they would do well to &s;hew it, for they have not done it yet. And if they &s;ay, Infants are al&s;o taken out of it, let them produce Scripture for it, and it will &s;uf|fice; and they, who plead &s;o hard for <HI>Expre&s;s Scripture, I</HI> think, are obliged to do it, or yield. And in the mean time, we believe, that if Infants, or Children, or Seed, were never once mentioned in the New Te&s;tament, they have as good a Title as they had in <HI>Abrahams</HI> days, to all the Signs of the Covenant of Grace, and that it belongs not to us to prove them a New to be in the Covenant, whom we find once in the Covenant now in being, but that it belongs to &s;uch as deny it to prove them
<PB N="49" REF="001635_0057_0FB3E272252F41B0">turned out. And we think that to be &s;o far beyond any warrant they can find in Sripture, that we be|lieve Infants or Children, on the account of their Parents, are expre&s;sly included &s;till, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.29. And that this Covenant or promi&s;e is the ground for Bapti&s;m. <HI>v.</HI> 28. Hence I argue,</P>

<P>But being in the Covenant, is the Ground for Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> All in the Covenant ought to be baptized.</P>
<P>And now, Dr. <HI>Ru&s;sel,</HI> for your <HI>&V;n&s;criptural Pra|ctice,</HI> which you &s;o vaunt with, If any &s;till deny Infants being included in the Promi&s;e, contrary to Scripture, I would know of them, by what War|rant they believe GOD will do that which he has never promi&s;ed? Or el&s;e <HI>I</HI> &s;hall believe it an Un|&s;criptural Practice in Dr. <HI>Ru&s;sel</HI> to believe &s;o uncha|ritably of Infants; They may be every &s;oul of them damned, for any thing he knows, if they are not included in the promi&s;e; <HI>Ay, but he has proved by Scripture, that they have a right to the King|dom of Glory in Heaven,</HI> &s;ee pag. 69. Very well, They are not in the Kingdom of Glory yet, The|refore it mu&s;t be a Promi&s;e, and I know of no Go&s;pel Promi&s;e but what is either Ab&s;olutely or Conditionally, and either mediately or immedi|ately the Promi&s;e of eternal Life; and <HI>I</HI> know of no &s;uch Promi&s;es to any of the Children of Men, but what are Go&s;pel promi&s;es; and I know no di&s;tinction in &s;uch revealed Promi&s;es, with re&s;pect to Bapti&s;m.</P>

<P>But nothing without the Promi&s;e is a Rule for Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> The Promi&s;e is our Rule to know whom to baptize.</P>
<P><HI>Di&s;ciple&s;hip, Faith, Repentance,</HI> and the <HI>Profes&s;ion of Faith,</HI> are to the Mini&s;ters only Rules to know who are under the Promi&s;e, and thereby Rules for Bapti&s;m. So any other Mark of being under the promi&s;e, as to be the Child of a believing Pa|rent, is a Rule for Bapti&s;m. I wonder what good Di&s;ciple&s;hip or Faith would do us, in order to Sal|vation, if neither ab&s;olute nor conditional Promi|&s;es were annexed, and therefore are they expre&s;&s;ed in the Commis&s;ion. I conclude, that when an ac|count of the Eunuchs Faith were demanded, it was to know whether he had an Intere&s;t in the Cove|nant Promi&s;e; For other Marks are required in the Adult, than in infants. I argue <HI>a pari,</HI></P>
<P>If the Promi&s;e be our Rule to know whom to baptize, then infants under the Promi&s;e, &s;o well as their Parents, are to be baptized, &s;o well as the Parents.</P>

<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> infants under the Promi&s;e, &s;o well as their Parents, are to be baptized &s;o well as their Parents.</P>
<P>The Adult have no other Title to it but the Promi&s;e, and if Dr <HI>Ru&s;sel</HI> &s;ay true, that Infants have a right to the Kingdom of Glory before they are in it, they have their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> by the Promi&s;e,

<P>If Bapti&s;m be come in the room of Circumci|&s;ion, then all that were to be Circumci&s;ed, are to be baptized, except &s;ome new order to the con|trary.</P>

<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> The Bapti&s;m only of Infants, &s;o well as Adult, is the light Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P>That Bapti&s;m which repre&s;ents only &s;ome Ar|ticles of Faith, is not the right Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>But the Bapti&s;m of only Adult, repre&s;ents only &s;ome Articles of Faith,</P>

Again, If Bapti&s;m belcome in the room of Cir|cumci&s;ion, then the Threatnings to the neglect of Circumci&s;ion are to be applyed to the neglect of Bapti&s;m, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now the Uncircumci&s;ed Child was threatned with &s;omething like damnation, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.14 He was to be <HI>Cut off from his People.</HI> Make the lea&s;t of it, it was to be cut off from the Covenant Promi&s;e, and &s;o is out of the Church, and the New Te&s;ta|ment promi&s;es no Salvation to the Unbaptized, <HI>Mark.</HI> 16.16.

And I think it is a &s;inful Pre&s;umption, to believe and rely upon that which God has not promi&s;ed, e&s;pecially when we thereby neglect that which he has annexed his Promi&s;e unto.</P>
<P>They ask expre&s;s Scripture, <HI>Baptize Infants;</HI> But there is no expre&s;s Scripture, <HI>Baptize Grown Per&s;ons,</HI> or <HI>give the Lords Supper to Women,</HI> or the like.

<P><HI>NB.</HI> Some of the&s;e Argumental have occa&s;ionally

<P>Now if I have committed any Fallacy in all that I have done, it is more than I know of, and <HI>I</HI> ac|count, that &s;uch as do it knowingly, in things that concern the Wor&s;hip of God and Mens immortal Souls, are the wor&s;t of men, and next to Devils.</P>

<P>Perhaps our Oppo&s;ers will object, That I have committed their Fault in applying &s;ome &s;criptures to Infants, which do not belong to them, &amp;c.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>On the Second Que&s;tion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Second Que&s;tion was,</P>
<P><HI>WHether the Ordinance of Bapti&s;m, as appointed by Chri&s;t, is to be admini&s;tred by Dipping, Plunging or Overwhelming only, and not otherwi&s;e?</HI></P>
<P>Dr. Ru&s;&s;el takes it in the Affirmative. His fir&s;t Argument is.</P>
<P><HI>The Holy Scripture &s;hews us the right way of Bap|tizing,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>But it doth not &s;hew us that it ought to be done by &s;prinkling.</HI></P>
<P>Ergo, <HI>Sprinkling is not the right way of Baptizing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I deny his <HI>Minor,</HI> and &s;hall anon prove the contrary. <HI>Secondly,</HI> By the &s;ame argument I can prove that <HI>Plunging</HI> is not the right way; for the Scripture doth not &s;hew us that is ought to be done &s;o, as <HI>I</HI> &s;hall &s;hew.</P>
<P>His next Argument is, That <HI>Sprinkling does
<PB N="56" REF="001635_0064_0FB3E27DB8DD28D0">&s;ignify that which ought to be repre&s;ented in Bapti&s;m,</HI> &amp;c. which I al&s;o deny, and &s;hall prove the contrary; and I &s;ay, and &s;hall prove the &s;ame of <HI>Plunging.</HI></P>
<P>To prove this, he undertakes to &s;hew from <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.4. and <HI>Col</HI> 2.12. <HI>That Bapti&s;m repre&s;ents the Burial and Re&s;urrection of our Saviour, and ours by him,</HI> which if true, does not prove his Argu|ment, except it repre&s;ent nothing el&s;e, if it do then. But the de&s;ign of the&s;e Scriptures is only to pre&s;s to a <HI>Holy Life,</HI> and one Argument is taken from Bapti&s;m, becau&s;e that it is an obligation to a holy Life, which is called <HI>a dying to Sin</HI> and a being <HI>crucified to the World,</HI> Gal. 6.14, &amp;c. But if he will have the manner of Bapti&s;m repre&s;ent Chri&s;t's Death or Burial, becau&s;e it obliges to Duties of Mortification that re&s;emble it, and are the effect of it, he would do well to bring &s;ome clearer Scripture for it. But if his Argument be true, our Bapti&s;m mu&s;t re&s;emble more, for it is &s;aid <HI>Ro.</HI> 6.3. <HI>are Baptized into his Death.</HI> Now that was by hanging on the Cro&s;s and &s;heding his blood; Therefore Bapti&s;m mu&s;t al&s;o re&s;emble that; But if the manner of Bapti&s;m mu&s;t an&s;wer the Sig|nification, the truth is, it &s;ignifies the wa&s;hing away of Sin by the blood of Chri&s;t, <HI>Acts</HI> 22.16. <HI>Ari&s;e and be Baptized,</HI> and wa&s;h away thy Sins. 1 Joh. 1.7. <HI>And the Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t his Son clean&s;eth us from all Sin.</HI> Now the way which re|pre&s;ents the application of the Blood of Chri&s;t, Is &s;prinkling, 1 Pet. 1.2. <HI>Through Sanctification of the Spirit unto Obedience, and &s;prinkling of the Blood of JES&V;S CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>Again, Bapti&s;m repre&s;ents and is an engagement
<PB N="57" REF="001635_0065_0FB3E27F29E0AC30">to the an&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience 1 Pet. 3.21. <HI>The like Figure whereunto even bapti&s;m doth now &s;ave us, not the puting away the filth of the fle&s;h, but the an|&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience,</HI> &amp;c. Now this is repre|&s;ented by &s;prinkling. Heb. 10.22. <HI>Having our Hearts &s;prinkled from an evil Con&s;cience.</HI> Now if the next words, <HI>And your Bodies wa&s;hed with pure Water,</HI> &s;ignify the &s;ame with the former, then the wa&s;hing thereis Sprinkling, which doubtle&s;s it is; but if it be ano|ther, it is not that which repre&s;ents clean&s;ing the Con&s;cience, and therefore is not Bapti&s;m. But Bapti&s;m &s;ignifies Clean&s;ing the Con&s;cience, and that is done by &s;prinkling. Now this &s;ignifi|cation of Bapti&s;m and Sprinkling I have from expre&s;s Scripture.</P>
<P>But where is his &s;ignification of Plunging from expre&s;s Scripture, which they &s;o much boa&s;t of? Therefore I mu&s;t turn upon Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> a little of that which he lays &s;o confidently upon others, with Triumph.</P>
<P>The way which doth not &s;ignifie that which ought to be repre&s;ented in Bapti&s;m, according to Chri&s;ts appointment, is not the right way of baptizing.</P>
<P>But Plunging doth not &s;ignify that which ought to be repre&s;ented in Bapti&s;m, according to Chri&s;ts appointment.</P>
<P>Ergo, Plunging is not the right way of Bapti|zing.</P>
<P>The Major is Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;els</HI> own. The Minor they will deny; Therefore I mu&s;t u&s;e his own Argument.</P>
<P>If plunging do &s;ignify that which ought to be

<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> Plunging doth not &s;ignify that which ought to be repre&s;ented in bapti&s;m according to Chri&s;ts appointment.</P>
<P>The <HI>Major</HI> is his own Argument, and the <HI>Minor</HI> I mu&s;t prove by his Argument.</P>
<P>If it be any where &s;o recorded in Holy Scripture, Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> or &s;ome other per&s;on, is able to &s;hew it.</P>
<P>But neither Dr <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> nor any other per&s;on what|&s;oever is able to &s;hew it,</P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> It is no where &s;o recorded.</P>
<P>Now if they cannot &s;hew us by Scripture that Chri&s;t has appointed <HI>Plunging</HI> to &s;ignify that which ought to be repre&s;ented in Bapti&s;m, they mu&s;t not blame us if we, after their Example, accu&s;e them of an <HI>Un&s;criptural Practice, not to call it wor&s;e, viz.</HI> a &s;uper&s;titious binding that which God has not bound, or laying a Command on Men in Gods Wor&s;hip, which God has not commanded.</P>
<P>I have produced <HI>expre&s;s &s;cripture,</HI> that &s;prinkling does &s;ignify the Application of the Blood of Chri&s;t, and clean&s;ing from an evil Con&s;cience, and that the&s;e ought to be repre&s;ented in Bapti&s;m; But they, without any true Con&s;equence, much le&s;s expre&s;s &s;cripture, &s;ay, that <HI>Plunging</HI> repre&s;ents a Burial, and that <HI>that</HI> ought to be repre&s;ented in Bapti&s;m. However <HI>I</HI> will not contend about the latter, let Bapti&s;m repre&s;ent a Burial, The ordi|nary way of burying is by throwing the Earth on
<PB N="59" REF="001635_0067_0FB3E282316C4860">to the Body, And hereafter we &s;hall hear how it repre&s;ents a Re&s;urrection al&s;o.</P>
<P>Having tryed <HI>Plunging</HI> by &s;ome of Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;els</HI> Arguments, I proceed to try Sprinkling by the &s;ame Rule, and &s;ay,</P>
<P>The way which doth &s;ignify that which ought to be repre&s;ented in Bapti&s;m, according to Chri&s;ts appointment, is the right way of baptizing.</P>
<P>But <HI>&s;prinkling</HI> doth &s;ignify that which ought to be repre&s;ented in Bapti&s;m, according to Chri&s;ts appointment.</P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> Sprinkling is the right way of Baptizing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Major</HI> is his own; the <HI>Minor</HI> I have proved by expre&s;s Scripture.</P>
<P>Now by the &s;ame Rule, I &s;ay, That manner which &s;ignifies Clean&s;ing from &s;in, mu&s;t be u&s;ed in Bapti&s;m. But &s;prinkling is that manner which &s;ignifies Clean&s;ing from &s;in, <HI>Ergo,</HI> Sprinkling mu&s;t be u&s;ed in Bapti&s;m. Again,</P>
<P>That which is a &s;ufficient &s;ign of clean&s;ing from &s;in, is a &s;ufficient &s;ign to be u&s;ed in Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>But &s;prinkling is a &s;ufficient &s;ign of clean&s;ing from &s;in, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36, 25. <HI>Then will I &s;prinkle Clean Water upon you, and ye &s;hall be clean,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Ergo</HI> Sprink|ling is a &s;ufficient &s;ign to be u&s;ed in Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>Now that <HI>Plunging</HI> does <HI>Not</HI> &s;ignify that which ought to be repre&s;ented in Bapti&s;m, appears thus,</P>
<P>The principal thing repre&s;ented in Bapti&s;m is our clean&s;ing from &s;in by the Blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But the Blood of Chri&s;t was not a River or Pond great enough to cover a Man, but &s;ome &s;treams, enough to &s;prinkle with; and this agrees with &s;cripture, which never de&s;cribes our clean&s;ing from
<PB N="60" REF="001635_0068_0FB3E283A94E9D90">&s;in by any other Figure than <HI>Sprinkling,</HI> that I remember.</P>
<P>Again, Bapti&s;m repre&s;ents the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>Mark.</HI> 1.8. This is expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>Pouring,</HI> and not by plunging, that ever I remember. See I&s;ai. 44.3. <HI>And I will pour my Spirit upon thy &s;eed,</HI> &amp;c. See al&s;o <HI>Joel</HI> 2.28.</P>
<P>Thus name what Repre&s;entation in Bapti&s;m you will, and <HI>&s;prinkling</HI> &s;ignifies it, As, <HI>&s;anct fication,</HI> the <HI>Gift</HI> of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t, Clean&s;ing from &s;in</HI> or <HI>Ju&s;tifi|cation,</HI> a <HI>good Con&s;cience</HI> or <HI>holy Life,</HI> the <HI>Applica|tion</HI> of the <HI>Blood of Chri&s;t,</HI> The <HI>Death of Chri&s;t,</HI> (by the &s;ign of <HI>Sprinkling</HI> his Blood) a <HI>Burial,</HI> and al&s;o the <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> of the <HI>Body.</HI> But where is the &s;cripture that <HI>Plunging</HI> &s;ignifies any one of the&s;e things, but mo&s;t of them are expre&s;&s;ed of <HI>Sprink|ling</HI> or <HI>Pouring,</HI> which is much the &s;ame. Hence the Blood of Chri&s;t where-with we are clean&s;ed, is called <HI>The Blood of Sprinkling,</HI> Hebr. 12, 14.</P>
<P>So when the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> was fore|told, it was &s;aid, <HI>&s;o &s;hall he Sprinkle many Nations,</HI> I&s;a. 52, 15. which mu&s;t needs allude to &s;omething, and what more properly than their <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> at their Conver&s;ion, which was the Token of it.</P>
<P>And now, where is Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;els</HI> Argument, that <HI>Rhanti&s;ma</HI> is never u&s;ed where the Ordinance of Bapti&s;m is &s;poken of? Now let them, if they can, produce any &s;cripture that &s;ays, <HI>I will Plunge them in clean Water, and they &s;hall be clean;</HI> Or of the Con|ver&s;ion of the Gentiles. <HI>So &s;hall he Plunge many Na|tions;</HI> Or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ays, <HI>Planged from an evil Con&s;cience;</HI> or calls the Blood of Chri&s;t <HI>The Blood of Plunging,</HI> or any thing equivolent to the&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="001635_0069_0FB3E2852AC226D8">
His next Argument is, <HI>That there is no account in &s;cripture that ever the Apo&s;tles, or any other Mini&s;ters in tho&s;e times and baptize any other way than by dipping,</HI> p. 89. Whereas by the &s;ame Medium, <HI>I</HI> can as well prove <HI>Sprinkling</HI> to be the only right way, and &s;ay, there is no account that ever they bapti|zed any other way than by <HI>Springling.</HI> And till they produce an In&s;tance of another way, my Argument is as good as his.</P>
<P>But they &s;uppo&s;e they have plentiful proof for Dipping, of which we &s;hall hear more anon.</P>
<P>The next Debate is upon the Etymology of the word <HI>Baptizo,</HI> p. 90. It is derived from <HI>Bapto</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>To Dip.</HI> Now <HI>Baptizo</HI> being al&s;o a Verb, &s;o well as <HI>Bapto,</HI> and being derived from it, mu&s;t according to the ordinary and u&s;ual way have &s;ome difference of &s;ignification; and there is no better way to know what it is, than by &s;eeing in what &s;en&s;e it is u&s;ed in the New Te&s;tament, where the Ordinance of Bapti&s;m is not &s;poken of, to know how to under&s;tand it where the Ordinance is &s;po|ken of.</P>
<P><HI>Mark.</HI> 7. We read of the Phari&s;ees who <HI>wa&s;h their hands before they eat,</HI> ver&s;. 4. <HI>When they come from the Market, except they wa&s;h, they do not eat.</HI> In the Greek Original it is [<HI>ei me Baptizontai</HI>] <HI>Except they are Baptized,</HI> which was but the wa&s;hing of their hands, Then follows the <HI>Wa&s;hing of Cups and Pots and brazen Ve&s;&s;els, and Tables.</HI> In the Greek it is [<HI>Bapti&s;mous</HI>] the <HI>Bapti&s;ms</HI> of Cups, &amp;c. Now Tho &s;maller things they might ea&s;ily <HI>Dip</HI> all over, but I conceive that in a Country where there was but little Water, &s;ew had convenience to dip their
<PB N="62" REF="001635_0070_0FB3E286ABF33880">Tables all over under water. Luke 11.38. <HI>The Phari&s;ees marvelled that</HI> (our Saviour) <HI>had not fir&s;t Wa&s;hed before dinner;</HI> In the Greek it is [<HI>e bapti&s;the</HI>] that he was not <HI>Baptized.</HI> Again, Heb. 9, 10. <HI>divers Wa&s;hings;</HI> in the Greek it is <HI>divers Bapti&s;ms;</HI> but tho&s;e Bapti&s;ms (as after de&s;cribed) were no|thing but <HI>Sprinklings.</HI> Hence <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> and <HI>Sprink|ling</HI> are words &s;o near of like &s;ignification, that they are u&s;ed for the &s;ame thing. Now let them, if they can, produce one place where <HI>Baptizo,</HI> or its derivatives, are u&s;ed for <HI>Dipping</HI> or <HI>Plunging. Bapto</HI> indeed is often u&s;ed for <HI>Lipping,</HI> and I think in no other &s;en&s;e; but <HI>Baptizo</HI> is another word. It matters not &s;o much how it is u&s;ed in Authors, becau&s;e &s;everal places and &s;everal Ages apply the &s;ame word to divers U&s;es, as may be &s;een in the &s;everal &s;hires in <HI>England,</HI> (not to look into other Countries or Tongues) as I can perceive by &s;uch as come from thence; Therefore the New Te&s;ta|ment Dialect is the only be&s;t Rule, and there we find that on all other occa&s;ions <HI>Baptizo</HI> &s;ignifies either Wa&s;hing or Sprinkling, and not Dipping.</P>
<P>He next argues upon the Prepo&s;ition [<HI>into</HI>] in the Greek [<HI>eis</HI>] and &s;ays, that <HI>when it is joyned with an Accu&s;ative it &s;ignifies Into,</HI> which is not a Rule, and therefore not &s;ufficient to rely ones Faith upon. Matth. 18.15, <HI>[ean amarte&s;e eis &s;e Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">lphos] If thy Brother tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee.</HI> Here <HI>[eis]</HI> with an Accu&s;ative, is <HI>Again&s;t,</HI> and not <HI>into.</HI> Some times it &s;ignifies <HI>&V;nto.</HI> John 13, 2 <HI>[eis telos] &V;nto that end.</HI> John. 7. often [eis ten eorten] <HI>&V;nto the Fea&s;t</HI> Acts 25 often <HI>&V;nto Jeru&s;alem.</HI> (and ver&s;. 10. it is <HI>Of</HI> or <HI>About, Doubting of &s;uch Que&s;tions.</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="001635_0071_0FB3E2894F8AF930">I might add a multitude of Examples. So it is not certain that <HI>Phillip</HI> and the Eunuch went more than <HI>&V;nto</HI> the water. John 12, 17. [eis ten he meran] <HI>Again&s;t the day,</HI> Not <HI>Into</HI> it, for &s;he &s;pent her Oyntment before the day came. <HI>Matth.</HI> 26, 10. [eis eme] <HI>&V;pon me.</HI> All the&s;e, and hundreds more, with an Accu&s;ative; Yea, <HI>[Into]</HI> in our Lan|guage &s;ometimes &s;ignifies but <HI>On to</HI> or <HI>&V;pon,</HI> as when the Tempter took our Saviour up <HI>Into</HI> an high Mountain, it was but <HI>On to</HI> it, otherwi&s;e he could not have &s;hewed him much. So the Particle <HI>[eis]</HI> cannot help them, nor can <HI>Into the Water</HI> (as it is tran&s;lated.) They al&s;o plead the coming <HI>Out</HI> of the Water, which will help them no more. Our Saviour came [apo tou hudatos] <HI>From the Water,</HI> is the true Translation, if <HI>Matth.</HI> 19, 8. [ap' archis] <HI>From the beginning,</HI> be true, and many more &s;uch, as Matt. 1.17, &amp;c. All with a Genitive, The Eunuch came <HI>[ec tou hudatos]</HI> and the &s;ame al&s;o with a Genitive. Matth. 19.20. [ecneotetos meu] <HI>From my Mouth,</HI> &amp;c. I need not add; But &s;ee how they build their &s;eparation from other Chri&s;tians on a fal&s;e Foundation.</P>
<P>He brings the opinion of a multitude of Authors, which &s;till is no Proof, if his Quotations be never &s;o true; and tho they all had baptized by Dipping or Plunging.</P>
<P>We read <HI>Nehem.</HI> 8.17. of &s;itting under <HI>Booths,</HI> which was commanded in the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> but had not been done &s;ince the days of <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> the Son of <HI>Nun.</HI> Now if &s;o many good Men, wi&s;e Men, and Kings and Prophets, &s;uch as <HI>David, Solomon,</HI> &amp;c. did not &s;ee to amend this, it is no wonder now, if
<PB N="64" REF="001635_0072_0FB3E28A744D6F50">&s;o many mi&s;s the &s;ignification of the word <HI>Baptizo,</HI> and take the Original &s;ignification in &s;tead of that which was in u&s;e by the Apo&s;tles; and if they fall into a mi&s;take, becau&s;e we read &s;ometimes of their going down <HI>&V;nto the Water,</HI> &amp;c. to Baptize, when they were in the woods, and had no other way.</P>
<P>In the next place he pleads from the places of <HI>Much Water</HI> &s;poken of, as <HI>Enon,</HI> which in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>Springs,</HI> and Travellers tell us, it is only a place of <HI>Many Springs,</HI> but no place for plunging, and I think they would not have look|ed cold &s;pring Water for that u&s;e; and the <HI>Greek</HI> word is <HI>Many Waters,</HI> which agrees with this Re|port; and it was therefore a convenient place that People might al&s;o have Water to drink.</P>
<P>His next Argument is from <HI>Acts</HI> 8.38. of Phillip <HI>and the</HI> Eunuch <HI>going down Into the Water.</HI> But does it &s;ay that he plunged or dipped him all over there? for the word <HI>Baptized</HI> does not prove that, as we have &s;een; nor is it certain that they went more than <HI>to</HI> the Water, &s;o far as to dip a handful, as has been evidenced; nay, if they went but half way over Shoes, they went into the water. But he &s;ays, <HI>they could have &s;ent for a little Water,</HI> But how does he know they had any empty ve&s;&s;el?</P>
<P>And what is the rea&s;on, (when we read of &s;o many Per&s;ons, bapti&s;ed in Hou&s;es and Cities) that there is never any mention of their going <HI>&V;nto</HI> nor <HI>into</HI> that Water, but only in the woods (as <HI>John</HI>) and on the Road, as <HI>Phillip</HI> with the Eunuch.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, we read <HI>Acts</HI> 10.47. <HI>Who can forbid Wa|ter?</HI> which has as fair a &s;how for its being brought, as going <HI>to</HI> the water, (when they had no other
<PB N="65" REF="001635_0073_0FB3E28BEBD129C0">way to get it) has of their Plunging, and <HI>I</HI> think a little fairer.</P>
<P>And the baptizing in <HI>Jordan,</HI> does no more Prove their <HI>Plunging</HI> all over in it, than the man wa|&s;hing his Eyes in the Pool of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">loam</HI> does prove that he was plunged all over, &s;eeing <HI>[baptizo]</HI> proves no more but <HI>Sprinkling,</HI> and <HI>[eis]</HI> is &s;o well u&s;ed there as in the other.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, their Arguments from the word <HI>Baptizo,</HI> and from going <HI>to</HI> or <HI>Into,</HI> and <HI>Out</HI> of or <HI>From</HI> the Water, and of baptizing <HI>in Jordan,</HI> and where there was <HI>Much Water,</HI> carry no Proof in them, and are but Probabilities at the be&s;t; and &s;o is <HI>en hudati,</HI> &s;ee <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.2. <HI>[en huio,] by his Son.</HI> And the&s;e are all the Proofs they have; For their Arguments from what &s;hould be repre|&s;ented in bapti&s;m, are wholly for us; for we have plentiful Expre&s;s-Scripture that <HI>Sprinkling</HI> &s;igni|fies every thing that the &s;cripture &s;peaks of as re|pre&s;ented in Bapti&s;m, but there is no &s;cripture that &s;peaks of <HI>Dipping,</HI> as &s;ignifying any &s;uch thing; And <HI>I</HI> hope, they will own, that it belongs to God, and not to Man, to appoint what &s;ign &s;hall repre&s;ent the thing &s;ignifyed.</P>
<P>Come now Dr. <HI>Ru&s;sel,</HI> Who are guilty of Un|&s;criptural Practice? Under the Ceremonial Law Typical Ordinances were commanded, in what manner they were to be u&s;ed, unto a <HI>Circum&s;tance;</HI> but under the Go&s;pel Admini&s;tration, the <HI>&s;piritual Improvement</HI> is principally looked upon. Bapti&s;m mu&s;t be with <HI>Water,</HI> but it is not &s;aid <HI>How;</HI> and I believe, if it had been tyed to any &s;et Form, it had been written in the Scripture; Therefore let
<PB N="66" REF="001635_0074_0FB3E28D67D34C18">us not <HI>Bind</HI> what God has left Unbound; but if the &s;cripture have given us any Rule for the Man|ner, it mu&s;t be <HI>Sprinkling;</HI> And it is mo&s;t evident from &s;cripture (as has been &s;hown) that <HI>Sprink|ling</HI> is fully &s;ufficient, and has the Promi&s;e annex|ed to that Sign, <HI>And they &s;hall be Clean,</HI> but no &s;uch promi&s;e annexed to Plunging.</P>
<P>Wherefore, it mu&s;t be none of the &s;malle&s;t of tho&s;e Sins, that are committed under the colour of Gods Wor&s;hip, when People deny the Bapti&s;m which they have received according to Gods ap|pointment, by receiving another.</P>
<P>But God does not always &s;hew vi&s;ible &s;igns of his di&s;plea&s;ure at evil Actions and profaning his Ordinances, &s;eeing we have the &s;cripture to te|&s;tifie.</P>
<P>I find the <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> (for they are worthily &s;o called) often Challenge People to give an In&s;tance of any one that ever got any harm by being plun|ged in cold Water, as if it were rational to expect that GOD had commanded a Duty, and that only in matter of &s;acrifice, which did many times re|quire a Miracle to pre&s;erve us above the ordinary cour&s;e of Nature in performing it; Though I be|lieve it would be pre&s;umption for a per&s;on to run him&s;elf into imminent danger, under this imagination, if not a breach of the &s;ixth Com|mandment, and a Tempting of God. Yet I know not but God may in his Mercy forgive the Igno|rance, and accept the Zeal of &s;ome, and not let them &s;uffer for it, e&s;pecially &s;uch as have not been baptized before, who&s;e duty it is to be baptized &s;ome
<PB N="67" REF="001635_0075_0FB3E28EF18D93D0">way; And I think, that People are &s;o begotted to their Error, that if &s;ome get cold and dye of it, they would not believe that to be the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But to an&s;wer that challenge, I can tell them of a more awful thing than getting Cold. I will not relate it as a thing of my own knowledge, for it was done before I was born, or not long after; but &s;uch as would be &s;atisfied, may enquire at <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> where dwelt one <HI>Betts,</HI> a Member of the Congregational Church there, who turned <HI>Anabapti&s;t,</HI> and was dipped, and (as I am told) came out of the water <HI>di&s;tracted,</HI> and &s;o remained; And his Children whom he, by this, did what was in him to throw out of the Church, be|came al&s;o Di&s;tracted: Two of his Sons I have &s;een, who are both Di&s;tracted Men; but his Grand Children are as other People; they all live now far from that place, and are as far from that Opi|nion, who have &s;o much rea&s;on as to know of Re|ligion.</P>

<P>I Advi&s;e the Reader, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Do not put away all Charity toward &s;uch as differ from you in this Doctrine, Provided you &s;ee in them the other Marks of the Fear of GOD; for great Faults in things not e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, when they proceed from meer Ignorance, do not hinder the &s;alvation of &s;uch as are in the e&s;&s;ential part &s;ound and &s;incere, and therefore ought not to hin|der our love to them, for his &s;ake that accepts and loves them, and forgives their Ignorance.</P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI> Do not think your &s;alvation &s;ecure, meer|ly becau&s;e you are &s;atisfied, that you are purely right in this Doctrine; for Bapti&s;m, not impro|ved, will do you no more good than knowledge not improved.</P>
<P>To help you herein, con&s;ider That the <HI>Bapti&s;|mal words</HI> repre&s;ent the <HI>Faith of the Holy Trinity.</HI> Improve it in the &s;aving knowledge of God our Maker, Redeemer, and Sanctifyer, and perform your Engagements to him, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Application of <HI>Clean Water</HI> implies a Con|fe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="70" REF="001635_0078_0FB3E2942AF5A288">that we are <HI>Polinted by Sin;</HI> For that which is clean, needs no Wa&s;hing. Therefore be hum|ble and penitent, and judge and condemn your &s;elf from the &s;en&s;e of it, and &s;o find your need of a Saviour, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Water applyed,</HI> repre&s;ents, That our help comes from without our &s;elves, namely, by the Blood of Chri&s;t that takes away our Guilt, and procures Pardon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and by his &s;pirit that ap|plies it in our Sanctification. There &s;eek it.</P>
<P>Again, the <HI>Water, applyed by the hands of another,</HI> (who is Gods Officer) implies, That it is not in our own power to apply the&s;e things, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There|fore &s;eek to him that can do it.</P>
<P>There being al&s;o <HI>Our Act</HI> in receiving Bapti&s;m on our &s;elves or Children, implies, That we are not to expect the Ble&s;&s;ings repre&s;ented in Bapti&s;m, as Promi&s;es to us, except we be found &s;eeking in Gods appointed way, as his Word, Meditations, Prayer, Practice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Again the <HI>Applying Clean Water,</HI> implies our Obligations and Engagements to a holy Life, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which cannot be without &s;elf-denyal.</P>
<P>And in the Bapti&s;mal words, <HI>Gods Name being put upon us,</HI> implies. That we are <HI>wholly his,</HI> and devoted to give up our &s;elves to &s;erve <HI>Him Only</HI> for|ever, and deny all that is again&s;t him.</P>
<P><HI>Our bodies</HI> being the part that the Elementary part is applyed to, repre&s;ents the <HI>Re&s;urrection of the Body</HI> to enjoy the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the Chief things repre&s;ented in our Bapti&s;ms; &s;o improve it, and it will be your happine&s;s, otherwi&s;e it is a Mockery, and taking Gods Name in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="001635_0079_0FB3E295A6F81EB8">
<HI>3dly,</HI> I advi&s;e &s;uch as have not been baptized, or have not got their Children baptized, not to delay it, le&s;t the Cur&s;e written, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.14. come upon them; Nor to delay performing that which is re|pre&s;ented as our Duty in Bapti&s;m, that they may have the Grace repre&s;ented in it; Otherwi&s;e the &s;ame Cur&s;e will neverthele&s;s come upon them; <HI>Jer.</HI> 9.25, 26.</P>
<P>I am not of their mind, who would have the Unbaptized deprived of any of the Priviledges common to Mankind, to force them; for Chri&s;t, our Redeemer, needs no forced &s;ubjects. It were a di&s;honour to think he did, or that his Grace were not lovely enough it &s;elf for a Motive; Nei|ther do they come to him in Truth, who come again&s;t their will; and to admini&s;ter his Ordinance to &s;uch, were greatly to profane it, and take Gods Name in vain; <HI>I</HI> mean, to &s;uch as are come of Age to chu&s;e, and in their heart do refu&s;e.</P>
<P>But <HI>I</HI> would have no other force or motive u&s;ed than Gods Word. For though Bapti&s;m is not &s;o e&s;&s;entially Nece&s;&s;ary, but that he, that has not the opportunity, may be &s;aved without it, if he have the Grace repre&s;ented, yet it is not &s;o with him that knows his duty, and has the Opportu|nity, and will not do it; For any wilful &s;in, though never &s;o &s;mall, per&s;i&s;ted in, brings Damnation, <HI>Jam.</HI> 2.10. becau&s;e it is not want of Ability, but willful Rebellion. Hence &s;alvation is promi&s;ed to him <HI>that believes and is Baptized,</HI> but not to the Unbaptized, to him it is &s;ilent. And when &s;ome <HI>were pricked to the heart, and cryed, What &s;hall we do?</HI> The reply was, <HI>Repent, and be Baptized,
<PB N="72" REF="001635_0080_0FB3E2972D833AD8">Acts</HI> 2.37, 38. and upon that condition the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> was promi&s;ed.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4thly,</HI> Let &s;uch, as have got their Children baptized, remember, you have in a mo&s;t &s;olemn manner declared them to be Di&s;ciples. Now, how came they to be Di&s;ciples, but by being the Children of one who will &s;urely <HI>Teach them aili|gently,</HI> and &s;et them all Examples of Piety. They are not Di&s;ciples by being under your care, if you do not do it &s;o &s;oon as they are capable. Now you have declared to God and his Church, That they are &s;uch, and that in a &s;olemn manner, by having Gods &s;acred <HI>Name</HI> named over them, as his Di|&s;ciples; &s;o that, if you neglect, you are guilty in a high degree of <HI>Lying unto God,</HI> and of taking his holy Name in vain! be&s;ide many more evils. Oh tremble to think upon it! Therefore Teach, Per|&s;wade, and Pray for them, till you &s;ee the ble&s;&s;ings of Di&s;ciple&s;hip in them.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5thly,</HI> I advi&s;e the Reader, that, if he &s;ee ground of Conviction by this Doctrinal, or this latter Practical Di&s;cour&s;e on Bapti&s;m, that he remem|ber, It is GOD, and not Man, <HI>with whom we have to do!</HI> Take heed, le&s;t ye <HI>Re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> in refu&s;ing the evidence of Truth. It will not help you in the Day of Judgment, that you have been wont to believe or practi&s;e otherwi&s;e; for if <HI>GOD wincked at your Ignorance</HI> before, <HI>now he calls you to Re|pent,</HI> and you have <HI>no Excu&s;e</HI> for the time to come. Therefore think upon it, as you expect to appear before the <HI>Judge of Quick and Dead.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Summ of the Matter.</HEAD>
<P>Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> propo&s;es a good Rule page 50. where he &s;ays, He <HI>had rather walk</HI> exactly <HI>by the Commi&s;&s;ion than by &s;uch Con&s;equences wherein he may be deceived.</HI> Now the Commi&s;&s;ion <HI>expre&s;&s;es</HI> Believers, and our &s;aviour calls &s;ome Infants <HI>Believers;</HI> The Apo&s;tles, who walked by the Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>expre&s;s</HI> the Promi&s;e as the ground for Bapti&s;m, and <HI>expre&s;s</HI> the Children of Believers, as being now under this promi&s;e; And much more, as has been &s;hown.</P>
<P>Again, the Scripture <HI>expre&s;&s;es</HI> almo&s;t (if not) all that is to be repre&s;ented in Bapti&s;m, by the word <HI>Sprinkle,</HI> &amp;c but none of them by <HI>Dipping.</HI> Nor is there one expre&s;s Scripture, nor nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;e|quence, that ever the Apo&s;tles or <HI>John</HI> Baptized by Dipping. This I averr, and dare challenge any <HI>Anti-pedo-bapti&s;t</HI> that goes on the ground, to deny any one of the&s;e Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Now, if I am in an Error, I pray GOD that I may &s;ee it! and that this Book may not pro&s;per if it defend Error! for I would not for a thou&s;and Worlds be in&s;trumental to pervert Gods Truth or mi&s;lead any Per&s;on. But if it be the Truth, I pray God defend and pro&s;per it again&s;t all the Powers of Hell, and make it a means to convince &s;uch as err from the Truth, and to confirm me and others in it, and in the good u&s;e of it. AMEN.</P>

<P>IF it be worth while to trouble the Reader with it (which I had not intended to have done, but I under&s;tand the <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> &s;adly blame Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> for que&s;tioning Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;els</HI> skill in the <HI>Hebrew)</HI> Pag. 102. Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> complains of a <HI>need|le&s;s Trouble</HI> put upon him to look the <HI>Hebrew, Dan.</HI> 4.33. It was indeed a <HI>needle&s;s Trouble</HI> to look for <HI>Hebrew</HI> there; for he that under&s;tands <HI>Hebrew</HI> when he reads it, will &s;ee, that the fourth Chap|ter of <HI>Daniel</HI> is not written in the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> but in the <HI>Caldean Tongue.</HI> I do not blame him for being ignorant of <HI>Hebrew</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> (if he be igno|rant) if he be not a vain glorious Pretender to what he has not, and con&s;equently an ambitious willful Deceiver (I do not &s;ay he is &s;uch an one) And I the rather in&s;ert this, becau&s;e I have lately heard, that he has put out a book to render Mr. <HI>Chandler,</HI> &amp;c. as vile as may be, on purpo&s;e to in|validate his Narrative of the <HI>Port&s;mouth Di&s;pute</HI> (for I hear he has given out one.) I am not acqua|inted with either of them, and know not their hone&s;ty; But this, and many things more (&s;ome of which I mentioned before) look to me dubious on Dr. <HI>Ru&s;sels</HI> part.</P>
<P>A bare Ignorance may be born with in them, if they do not pretend above their &s;phere; but &s;uch an Ignorance as I have heard of in one of their Preachers, who preaching how <HI>Chri&s;t being Rich,
<PB N="75" REF="001635_0083_0FB3E29BAF4EFE10">became Poor for our &s;akes,</HI> among other things, &s;aid, <HI>He parted with his Eternity</HI> for a time; I think this is too gro&s;s for a <HI>Communicant,</HI> and much more for a <HI>Teacher;</HI> &s;ome call it Bla&s;phemy.</P>
<P>I &s;peak not this to vilify them, as Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> did the <HI>Pre&s;byterians,</HI> in his &s;tory of the Eunuchs Wife and Children, but to warn them to take better care to examine their Preachers, and to advi&s;e them to hear &s;uch as can give a better rea&s;on for their Faith, and be le&s;s conceited of their own knowledge; For the man I &s;peak of has a great name among many of them. But if Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> had not told that Story, I had not told this; and I have as good Authority for my &s;tory as he for his, <HI>I heard &s;o,</HI> and that from a credible Per&s;on, that heard it.</P>
<P>Well, Mr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> looked for <HI>Tabal,</HI> Dan. 4. 33. but it <HI>was not there.</HI> And how &s;hould it, it being properly an <HI>Hebrew</HI> Word, and the place <HI>Chaldee?</HI> But why does he not tell us what he found there, and what the advantage was to his Argument? For it is <HI>T&s;abaa</HI> (or as it is comonly read <HI>T&s;ahang</HI>) there u&s;ed [<HI>Jit&s;tabbaa</HI>] and in the <HI>Caldean</HI> Tongue &s;ignifies to Dip, as <HI>Tabal</HI> does in the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> but may be applyed al&s;o to <HI>Sprinkling</HI> or Weting with the Dew, and &s;o does <HI>Bapto,</HI> if Dr. <HI>Ru&s;sel</HI> &s;ay true, that the <HI>Greek</HI> here in the Tran&s;lation cal|led the <HI>Septuagent,</HI> is <HI>Ebaphe,</HI> which differs from <HI>Bapto,</HI> ju&s;t as much as <HI>He was wet,</HI> differs from <HI>I wet;</HI> For we mu&s;t believe, whoever did it, they were &s;uch as under&s;tood the u&s;e of <HI>Greek</HI> words in that Age (&s;ome time before Chri&s;t) &s;o well or bet|ter then any do now.</P>

<P>SInce the fore going <HI>Examination of the Port&s;mouth Di&s;pute</HI> was &s;ent to the Pre&s;s, I got a &s;ight of the Narrative of the &s;ame di&s;pute given out by Mr. <HI>Chandler,</HI> Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> and Mr. <HI>Robin&s;on.</HI> They do not pretend to relate all that was &s;poken, but only &s;o much as the Writers took down, where|by mo&s;t of the Arguments are given in &s;hort; and where they found a nece&s;&s;ity to add &s;ome|thing by their Memory, to make the &s;en&s;e, they gave it in other Characters, that it might be known. There are many Arguments which are not in Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;els,</HI> and they accu&s;e him of ad|ding what was not &s;poken, &amp;c. They have their Narrative atte&s;ted by Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> one of the writers, that it agrees exactly with his and Mr. <HI>Malthy's</HI> Notes.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> and his Friends have &s;et out a Reply, (entitled) <HI>Truth prevailing again&s;t the the fierce&s;t Op|po&s;ition</HI> (which <HI>I</HI> &s;aw with it) wherein they ac|cu&s;e Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> of the &s;ame faults.

<P>As for In&s;tance. Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> to &s;how his Rea|&s;ons why he thinks Dr. <HI>Ru&s;sel</HI> beholding to others for his <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew,</HI> tells of a Book which has fal&s;e <HI>Greek,</HI> prefixed to the Title, and &s;up|po&s;eth

<P>This Dr. <HI>Ru&s;sel</HI> &s;pends many lines upon, and has it over in two places in his book, and infers that Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> accu&s;es the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> of fal&s;e <HI>Greek,</HI> and improves it, That <HI>thus</HI> the <HI>Apostle mu&s;t be whipt</HI> (by Mr. <HI>Chandler) to learn him better,</HI> &amp;c.

Circumci&s;ion was the Token of the Co|venant with God, and Bapti&s;m is the Token of giving the Holy Gho&s;t, and that is Gods Cove|nant with us, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 59.21. <HI>This is my Covenant, my &s;pirit, &amp;c.</HI> So Bapti&s;m is <HI>Now</HI> what Circumci&s;ion <HI>then</HI> was, <HI>viz.</HI> the Token of the Covenant, and Children are in the Covenant, on their Parents account, without re&s;pect of another Call, if to have an Intere&s;t in the Covenant or in the Pro|mi&s;e, be the &s;ame thing [<HI>&s;ee more in my &s;ixt Chap.

<P>Al&s;o, Mr. <HI>Sharp</HI> in that Book (for it has many Au|thors, and all approved by Dr. <HI>Ru&s;sel</HI>) &s;ays, pag. 38 very well, that <HI>Infants are made meet for Glory by the work of the &s;pirit, which (to us) is altogether &s;ecret.</HI> Now this mu&s;t be by Sanctification (I hope) And he Sanctifies them thro'-out (I hope) And if &s;o, they mu&s;t have a habit of every Grace, and if &s;o, of Faith too (and <HI>I</HI> think they can|not be meet for Heaven while their natural un|belief
<PB N="82" REF="001635_0090_0FB3E2A629ED9CB0">remains full, and they in that part no way Sanctifyed) and if &s;o, they are Subjects of Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>This is <HI>to us &s;ecret,</HI> and &s;o a Faith to us un|&s;een. And why will they not believe it then, except they &s;ee it?</P>
<P>However, the&s;e Infants have the Spirit; And who can forbid them Bapti&s;m? <HI>&s;ee more in my fifth Chapter,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>Chap.</HI> 6. <HI>Arg.</HI> 6. and Acts 10.</P>
<P>And Now, Mr. <HI>Sharp,</HI> where is your Argu|ments, That <HI>Infants Bapti&s;m hath neither Precept nor Precedent in the Word of God?</HI> When the A|po&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> Challenged any one that dare deny it them? If you &s;ay True, That <HI>the Spirit makes them meet for Glory;</HI> The Spirit is Promi&s;ed in the Covenant; Bapti&s;m is the Sign of it, and <HI>Peter</HI> argues well, that &s;uch as God has taken into his Covenant, by giving what it <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> &s;hould have the <HI>Sign.</HI></P>
<P>The Promi&s;e is at lea&s;t Conditional to all that are <HI>Called,</HI> and their Children; The&s;e we know, and the&s;e are vi&s;ible Members.</P>
<P>The Promi&s;e is ab&s;olute to all that are <HI>Cho&s;en;</HI> The&s;e we know not, but by their Calling.</P>
<P>Thus I have given a ta&s;te of the good that may be gotten out of their Book, but I forbear to enlarge, except they Re-print that al&s;o.</P>

<P>SINCE I &s;ent my <HI>Examination of the Port&s;|mouth Di&s;pute</HI> to the Pre&s;s, I have &s;een a Book written again&s;t <HI>Poedo-Bapti&s;m,</HI> by one <HI>Phillip Cary,</HI> Prefaced and highly approved by <HI>Will.

And there is no <HI>Anti-Poedo-bapti&s;t</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="001635_0092_0FB3E2A9335CCDC0">but will grant, that all tho&s;e concerning whom there is any <HI>Tolerable Evidence</HI> given that they are <HI>Regenerated Per&s;ons, united to Chri&s;t,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Sins are forgiven,</HI> and that they have <HI>received the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> are to be baptized. Now to affirm that all infants of Believers, either actu|ally or Imputatively <HI>are Sanctified, Regenerated, Ju&s;tified, is quite contrary to</HI> Rom. 9.6 <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as al&s;o to daily experience.</Q></P>
<P>This they bring as an Argument again&s;t In|fant Bapti&s;m, <HI>viz.</HI> We cannot Prove that they all have the thing &s;ignified by Bapti&s;m, Yea, that it is evident that &s;ome have not.</P>
<P><HI>I Reply. 1&s;t.</HI> By the &s;ame Rule, <HI>no Adult</HI> per|&s;on mu&s;t be Baptized; for we cannot prove that all who profe&s;s Faith, and vi&s;ibly appear to have it, are believers with all their Heart; Yea, it is evident, that many have not.</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> By this Rule, Where there is any tolera|ble Evidence given, that an Infant is <HI>Regenerated, United to Chri&s;t</HI> &amp;c. that Infant is to be Baptized. Now to know whether there be or no, let us Year what they &s;ay pag. 57.
<Q>We do not ex|clude Infants from the great Work of Rege|neration. And Pag. 59. We do not exclude Infants of Believers from the Ordinary way of Salvation; and they may be &s;anctified by the Spirit of God.</Q> Thus, if we may believe them, There is a tolerable Evidence given of the In|fants of believers, that they are <HI>Regenerated, &V;nited to Chri&s;t</HI> (for that is the Ordinary way of Salvation) that their Sins are forgiven, and that they have received the Holy Gho&s;t. But
<PB N="85" REF="001635_0093_0FB3E2AAE7CF0658"><HI>we are not Sure they all are Regenerate, &amp;c.</HI> No more are we of any Adult Per&s;on profe&s;&s;ing it. It is not an A&s;&s;urance but a tollerable Evi|dence that is required unto Bapti&s;m; we know that &s;ome Infants of Believers are <HI>united to Chri&s;t,</HI> and while we have no more rea&s;on to doubt of <HI>this Infant</HI> more than of <HI>that,</HI> we have a tolerable Evidence for both, and this is as much as can be &s;aid of <HI>Adult per&s;ons</HI> profe&s;&s;ing Faith</P>
<P><HI>3dly.</HI> By this Rule, if Infants are &s;aved in the ordinary way, then they are Sanctified, and are Believers. And now ye <HI>Anti-Poedo-Bapti&s;ts,</HI> where is your Argument <HI>That an infant cannot be a Believer?</HI> For by your own words, &s;ome Infants are Believers, and are to be Baptized. Get this off if you can, and if your Con&s;ci|ence will allow you to oppo&s;e the Truth, which is &s;o evident as to force a confe&s;&s;ion from tho&s;e who do their utmo&s;t to oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>And I would know why &s;ome Infants may not have a <HI>Principle</HI> of Faith without exerci&s;e, &s;o well as all Infants have a <HI>Principle</HI> of Rea&s;on without exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>If there need a further Te&s;timony, I add a fourth Argument to my &s;econd Chapter, Rom. 4.11. <HI>And he received the Sign of Circumci&s;ion, the Seal of the Faith, which he had.</HI> &amp;c. Hence</P>
<P>If Circumci&s;ion was a Seal of Faith, then all that were to be circumci&s;ed, were &s;uch of whom there was a vi&s;ible or tollerable Evidence that they were believers. The Infants of vi&s;ible believer were to be circumci&s;ed. Again,</P>
<P>If Circumci&s;ion was a &s;ign or Seal of Faith
<PB N="86" REF="001635_0094_0FB3E2AC35AF54F8">then it was of the &s;ame u&s;e that Bapti&s;m is now, and Bapti&s;m is come in the room of it, and Circumci&s;ion was a Token of the Covenant of Grace.</P>
<P>But the principal de&s;ign of their Book is to &s;hut Infants out of the Covenant of Grace, by an&s;wering the Arguments that prove them in it, &s;o they deny that circumci&s;ion was appointed as a Seal or &s;ign of Faith in <HI>all,</HI> tho' it was &s;o in <HI>Abraham, Beau&s;e he was circumci&s;ed to be the Father of al them that believe, &amp;c. which others were not.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Then it was a Covenant of <HI>Faith,</HI> to which he was circumci&s;ed; and as the <HI>believing Father,</HI> &s;o the <HI>believing Children</HI> were to be circumci&s;ed. If he had been circumci&s;ed to be the Father of the <HI>Legally righteous,</HI> it had been to their pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Again, they object <HI>He was to be</HI> Heir of the World, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.13.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> An an&s;werable Heir&s;hip belongs to his believing Children, <HI>ver&s;.</HI> 14.</P>
<P>Again, they &s;ay, <HI>Some were circumci&s;ed who were not true believers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The &s;ame Rule may deny <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> to be u&s;ed as a &s;ign of Faith; For many are Baptized who are not true believers, and even fal&s;e Bre|thren in the Apo&s;tles days.</P>
<P>Again, they deny <HI>That the circumci&s;ion Covenant required Regeneration,</HI> &amp;c. contrary to <HI>Jer.</HI> 9.26. and many other Scriptures in both Te&s;taments, al&s;o contrary to expre&s;s Sripture, which calls circumci&s;ion the <HI>Token of the Covenant,</HI> and as a Token required <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> and <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Servants to
<PB N="87" REF="001635_0095_0FB3E2ADB4D2DB90">be circumci&s;ed. They deny that the&s;e were in|cluded in <HI>Abrahams</HI> Covenant, <HI>Becau&s;e God would e&s;tabli&s;h his Covenant with</HI> I&s;aac.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;. 1&s;t.</HI> Even at this day the Covenant is not e&s;tabli&s;hed with all vi&s;ible believers, but only with true Believers <HI>2dly.</HI> The Covenant &s;o to be e&s;tabli&s;hed with <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> and not with the re&s;t, was the Heir&s;hip of the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> that was after Circumci&s;ion was aboli|&s;hed, becau&s;e Chri&s;ts blood (which it Typified) was now already &s;hed. Now to be circumci&s;ed did vertually deny any benefit by the Sufferings of Chri&s;t, which were pa&s;t, and con&s;equently any benefit at all; but if it had been &s;o before, Then <HI>Abraham</HI> and the <HI>Propkets</HI> and <HI>all I&s;rael</HI> had no profit by Chri&s;t. In this Sence it is that <HI>Circumci&s;ion</HI> and the <HI>Levitical Prie&s;thood</HI> and <HI>Cere|monies annexed</HI> were legal; They were <HI>only</HI> &s;ig|nificant of Chri&s;t and his &s;ufferings <HI>to come</HI> (and &s;o in the time of them were purely <HI>Evangelical</HI>) But when the <HI>Anti-type</HI> was come, the u&s;e of them did, by &s;ignifying that it was yet to come, &s;igni|fy a denyal of him, and &s;o bound men to the Law for Salvation: and thus became purely <HI>Legal.</HI> And the aboli&s;hing of this Law by the coming of Chri&s;t, typifies our being freed from the <HI>Covenant of Works</HI> and <HI>Cur&s;e of the Low</HI> by <HI>Faith in Chri&s;t.</HI> The&s;e &s;ignifying only things to come, expired of Cour&s;e, when they were come, and yet were expre&s;ly repealed, much

<P>Pag. 30 They &s;ay, <HI>The Intere&s;t which a Child had in the Everla&s;ting Covenant under the former Ad|mini&s;tration, it &s;till retains.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it follows, that Infants were in the Covenant of Grace under the former Admini|&s;tration, and are &s;till.</P>
<P>And if it was under an Admini&s;tration, there mu&s;t have been &s;omething <HI>admini&s;tred</HI> to them, by virtue of their Intere&s;t in the everla&s;ting Covenant, or Covenant of Grace The diffe|rence between <HI>that</HI> and <HI>this</HI> Admini&s;tration, was in vi&s;ible Ordinances; &s;o there mu&s;t have been a <HI>Go&s;pel Covenant Ordinance</HI> admini&s;tred then to Infants. Tell me he that can what this was, except <HI>Circumci&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>And from the Quotations p. 25. it &s;eems <HI>Abrahams</HI> Church is &s;till in being, and is a Go&s;pel Church, and we are in it. Tell us where our In|fants are turned out, before they turn them&s;elves out by unbelief and Di&s;obedience? (as the <HI>Jews</HI> did in our <HI>Saviours time,</HI> and as many evil deeds did (by Gods Command from <HI>Abrahams</HI> time) require a <HI>cuting off from their People,</HI> not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="91" REF="001635_0099_0FB3E2B3B5F727B0">they had <HI>Abraham to their Father,</HI> which the proud Phari&s;ees did not con&s;ider, till <HI>John</HI> told them of it) &s;eeing a Child &s;till retains the Intere&s;t it had then.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 62 They tell us <HI>In Chri&s;t and a right to the Promi&s;es Out of Chri&s;t,</HI> and &s;trangers to the Covenant of Promi&s;e, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.12.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, &s;eeing Infants are &s;aved in the <HI>Ordinary way,</HI> which is by being <HI>United to Chri&s;t,</HI> and there is no Salvation out of Chri&s;t) &s;ome Infants are in Chri&s;t, and therefore have a right in the Promi&s;es.</P>
<P>The Qe&s;tion is, where tho&s;e promi&s;es are re|corded? If it be the Promi&s;es to believers, then &s;ome Infants are believers (but that is already granted, p 65. For if all Infants of believers are <HI>United to Chri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. then they are <HI>al Believers;</HI> So &s;eeing only &s;ome are, there are &s;ome Infants Believers. I admire the Impudence of &s;ome men to forbid them Bapti&s;m, &s;eeing all agree that the Commi&s;&s;ion requires the Bapti&s;m of all Believers, Yea, and that a tollerable Evidence is &s;ufficient, even where there is ground in Charity to hope it). But if the Promi&s;e to Infants be where little Children were brought to Chri&s;t, then the promi&s;e is only to &s;uch as are brought, for of &s;uch is the King|dom of Heaven; I mean we know not that it is to more. Now the&s;e mu&s;t be brought by order of believing Parents or Ma&s;ters; for unbelievers will not bring theirs.</P>
<P>If it be the Promi&s;es to Believers, and their Children, we al&s;o know what Infants they are,
<PB N="92" REF="001635_0100_0FB3E13A67774580">whom we are to account in the Covenant. One would think now that we had done, &s;eeing they own <HI>Abrahams</HI> Church to be a Go&s;pel Church, and &s;till in being, and we in it, and that our Infants &s;till retain their right in that Everla&s;ting Cove|nant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But they are not &s;o willing to be convinced them&s;elves or to leave gaining Pro&s;elites (where|in the Children commonly are pro&s;elyted and made their Di&s;ciples by virtue of their Parents being pro&s;elited) But &s;eeing it will not do after &s;pending &s;o many Sheets of Paper: but infants will be in the Covenant of Grace and under the Promi&s;e &s;till, They even conclude to do as well <HI>another way,</HI> and deny the <HI>Covenant or Promi&s;e to be the Ground of Bapti&s;m.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now</HI> if by the <HI>Ground</HI> or <HI>Rule</HI> they mean the Commi&s;&s;ion or Command, we will agree with them, that the Promi&s;e is not the Command.</P>
<P>But if they deny that the Commi&s;&s;ion requires the baptizing of all that are vi&s;ibly in the Cove|nant, or under the promi&s;e, and no others, we mu&s;t try to confute them. We mu&s;t remember they tell us <HI>Out of Chri&s;t and &s;trangers to the Cove|nant of promi&s;e,</HI> Therefore if a right in the Promi&s;e, then in Chri&s;t, and if in Chri&s;t, that is, United to him, <HI>Then they are Sanctified, and are believers,</HI> and then tho&s;e Texts <HI>Acts</HI> 8.37. <HI>Acts</HI> 10.47. <HI>Acts</HI> 11.17. do undeniably prove their right to Bapti&s;m. All this they &s;ay, and therefore nothing without the promi&s;e is a Rule for Bapti&s;m (as I once &s;aid) <HI>That is,</HI> nothing but by virtue of the Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>If any reject their Te&s;timony, as Humane
<PB N="93" REF="001635_0101_0FB3E13BE5DBAA68">(though &s;ufficiently grounded on the Scripture (under&s;tood with the di&s;tinctions between <HI>really</HI> and <HI>conditionally,</HI> and <HI>vi&s;ibly</HI>) The Gift or promi&s;e of the Holy Gho&s;t, is the rea&s;on for Bapti&s;m, <HI>Mark.</HI> 1.8. <HI>Acts</HI> 2.38.</P>

<P>I pray God to give them a Heart willing to believe the Truth.

But if an An&s;wer come out again&s;t my Book, we have cau&s;e to fear from what principle it comes. The Lord make us all willing to believe the Truth!</P>
<P>Thus I have given an account of the principal Arguments in this Book, &s;o highly commended by &s;everal of their Chief Writers, as the excelling all that went before it.</P>
<P>The latter part of the Book is cheifly concer|ning the two Covenants, wherein <HI>I</HI> take him to be partly right, but it does not much concern the controver&s;y. He often flies to their common refuge, of crying out again&s;t u&s;ing that in Gods Wor&s;hip which he has not commanded. When|as he owns that to be an <HI>undenyable proof for Bapti&s;m</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="001635_0102_0FB3E13D67976BF8">if it were in Infants; which he owns to be in In|fants (as I have &s;hown).</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> add yet, which might end the controver&s;y, We need &s;ome humane means to under&s;tand the Holy Scriptures, as to learn to &s;peak and read, &s;o we need <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> to under&s;tand the Prophe&s;ies in <HI>Da|niel,</HI> and the <HI>Revelations,</HI> &s;o we need to &s;earch <HI>An|tiquity</HI> to know in what &s;en&s;e any doubtful word in the Scripture was u&s;ed in the <HI>Nation and Age</HI> wherein it was written; and &s;ome have proved that the name of <HI>Pro&s;elyte</HI> or <HI>Di&s;ciple</HI> was given to In|fants with their Parents, in the age when our Saviour lived on Earth, and is &s;o by the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;till; And that the Apo&s;tle and &s;uch as fir&s;t followed them under&s;tood the commi&s;&s;ion no other way.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire the Reader to excu&s;e me, having had no opportunity this twenty years to read Ancient Hi&s;tory; if <HI>I</HI> mi&s;took about <HI>Pelagius,</HI> &s;etting him a hundred Years too late, and &s;aying, <HI>he denyed In|fants bapti&s;m,</HI> which was only judged the Con&s;e|quence of his Doctrine, But he being charged with it, &s;aid, <HI>He never heard that ever any man denyed it,</HI> &amp;c. And this was &s;ufficient ground for <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> to write in Defence of Infant Bapti&s;m, not to prove the thing (which was not denyed) but to prove it nece&s;&s;ray as a &s;ign <HI>of Remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins,</HI> &s;o well as for other rea&s;ons. Al&s;o, I am not &s;ure whether <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> did not defer his Bapti&s;m to be baptized in <HI>Jordan.</HI> The&s;e things <HI>I</HI> have lately met with in Quotations, and will not tru&s;t my memory.</P>
<P>But finding that <HI>Pelag us</HI> made this reply, after he had travelled many Countryes <HI>I</HI> infer, that
<PB N="95" REF="001635_0103_0FB3E13EE995F730">Denying Infants Bapti&s;m was &s;o little thought of, two or three hundred years after the Apo&s;tles days, that he who&s;e Doctrine led directly to it, did not then once think of bringing &s;uch a new unknown thing into the Church, and it was im|po&s;&s;ible that men of his parts and learning and Travel &s;hould not have known it, if ever it had been denyed in the &s;pace of two or three hundred Years before.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> do by the Books of the <HI>Fa|thers,</HI> as they do by many Authors now, particu|larly the <HI>Church Catechi&s;m,</HI> out of which they may as well make tho&s;e that know not the <HI>Church of England,</HI> believe, that they deny Infant Bapti&s;m, as they do now make, &s;uch as know no better, believe, the Fathers denyed it.</P>
<P>Indeed <HI>Tertullian,</HI> by him&s;elf, was again&s;t Baptizing Infants or young per&s;ons, except they were in danger of Death, le&s;t they &s;hould not live an&s;werably. This was no denying the thing, but accounted by him a point of prudence.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o to adverti&s;e the Reader, that in the beginning of my &s;econd Chapter, in An&s;wer to Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s fir&s;t Argument, I had al&s;o Referrence to his fourth Argument, where he in&s;i&s;ts upon the &s;ame Fallacy in many pages together, though he pretends not to in&s;i&s;t upon it, and pretends to be content with <HI>any proof,</HI> and yet nothing will &s;erve him but an <HI>In&s;tance.</HI> This <HI>I</HI> an&s;wered (pro|ving it a Fallacy) where I fir&s;t found it; and indeed all his arguments, and all the Arguments they u&s;e again&s;t Infant Bapti&s;m depend upon that <HI>one Fallacy,</HI> as he that ob&s;erves will find.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="001635_0104_0FB3E140604250E8">
Hence the ground of their Faith in &s;eperation from all other Chri&s;tians, depends on a fal&s;e Ar|gument, and &s;o we &s;ee the Ground they have to <HI>rend</HI> the Church of Chri&s;t to pieces, and <HI>tear</HI> his members one from another, and cau&s;e the <HI>Wounds</HI> and <HI>Pains</HI> of <HI>Strife, Anger</HI> and <HI>Sorrow,</HI> and hin|der <HI>Love</HI> (&s;o earne&s;tly recomended by our Lord and Saviour, as his <HI>delight,</HI> and the <HI>Glory of his Kingdom,</HI> and the way for our <HI>Edification</HI>) and cau&s;e, in &s;tead thereof, <HI>Contention, Mi&s;-&s;pending of Time, Lying, Revenge</HI> and every evil Work.</P>
<P>One Word more, becau&s;e &s;ome excu&s;e their Re-baptizing, from <HI>Acts</HI> 19.5.</P>
<P>That ver&s;e is only a continuation of <HI>Pauls</HI> words, wherein be tells what <HI>John</HI> &s;aid to &s;uch as came to him, and that <HI>when they heard it, they were baptized in the Name of the</HI> Lord Je&s;us (<HI>i. e.</HI> by <HI>John</HI>) And when <HI>Paul</HI> had told them this, he laid his hands upon them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But Suppo&s;e it were doubtful whether it was thus, or whether they were bap|tized again, who that fears God would venture upon a doubtful Interpretation of Scripture, to deny his Bapti&s;m, the &s;ign of his Covenant with God, and thereby u&s;e the &s;ign of ca&s;ting him&s;elf out of the Covenant of Grace, as they that were circumci&s;ed (after Circumci&s;ion was aboli&s;hed) did, to be taken in a-new? For there is but one <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> and one <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> the &s;ign of it, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.5. and he that is ca&s;t out, cannot take him&s;elf in again, and has no other &s;helter to fly to. There is help in the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> for &s;uch as have broke the <HI>Law Covenant,</HI> but no more help for &s;uch as are ca&s;t out of the <HI>Go&s;pel Covenant</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="001635_0105_0FB3E141E22A79A8">Therefore take heed of u&s;ing the &s;ign of it! be|cau&s;e that <HI>re&s;embles</HI> the thing it &s;elf! and there is no Covenant but the Go&s;pel to be &s;aved by, &s;ince the Fall.</P>
<P>I find &s;ome of their Authors tell us, that Gods Word has limitted Bapti&s;m to <HI>Actual Believers.</HI> I de&s;ire them to &s;hew the Scripture for it; They de&s;pi&s;e the di&s;tinction of <HI>Compleat</HI> and <HI>Incompleat</HI> Di&s;ciples, as un&s;criptural. But where is the Scripture for <HI>Actual Believers,</HI> in di&s;tinction from another &s;ort. A di&s;tinction may be made with|out Scripture, but then we may not apply that to the one which we deny to the other without Scripture. Now if they find the Scripture that tells us what Believers mu&s;t be baptized, and which not, and the like of Di&s;ciples, we will hear them.</P>
<P>Thus they fly from Church Member&s;hip, the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> Yea, and <HI>&s;ome Faith,</HI> being the ground of Bapti&s;m, when the&s;e are proved in Infants, rather then yield, and that after they have &s;o long &s;trove to keep them out of all, and that after they have owned, that if the&s;e things could be proved, they ought to be baptized; <HI>Lord what &s;hall be done with &s;uch Men, who are re&s;olved not to &s;ee.</HI></P>
<P>The other day occa&s;ionally opening the <HI>Greek</HI> Te&s;tament, I hit upon <HI>John</HI> 20.4, 5. <HI>And the other Di&s;ciple out-ran</HI> Peter, <HI>&amp; came fir&s;t [eis to Menemeon] to the Sepulcher,</HI> v. 5&mdash;<HI>but he went not in.</HI> This alone is enough to cut off all their pretence from the Baptized going into the water. and for their coming out of the water, it is as much as tho&s;e,
<PB N="98" REF="001635_0106_0FB3E1435ED353B0"><HI>Acts</HI> 10.12 coma <HI>out</HI> of <HI>Cornelius</HI> and [<HI>en <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">udat<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>] is <HI>in the Water,</HI> as much as [<HI>en M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">aira</HI>] is <HI>in the Sword,</HI> Mat, 26.52.</P>
<P>By further reading of Mr. <HI>Chandlers</HI> Narrative, <HI>I</HI> find that the <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> having the Opponency, fir&s;t took up &s;o much time, that the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> had time to u&s;e but two head Arguments of Seven which they had intended, in both of which they put the <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> to Silence, that they &s;tood a con&s;iderable time without &s;peaking, till &s;tood the Moderator asked them, whether they had no more to &s;ay?</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> would al&s;o add to the end of my &s;ixth Chap. to avoid mi&s;takes, the&s;e Words, <HI>viz. So far as this will go for an Argument, it proves the</HI> Validity <HI>of In|fant Bapti&s;m, and al&s;o &s;prinkling, that it is as power|ful again&s;t the Devil as Adult Bati&s;m and Plunging.</HI></P>
