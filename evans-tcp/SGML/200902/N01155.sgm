<L>EIght Parts of <HI>Speech</HI> this Day wear <HI>Mourning Gowns</HI></L>
<L>Declin'd <HI>Verbs, Pronouns, Participles, Nouns.</HI></L>
<L>And not declined, <HI>Adverbs</HI> and <HI>Conjunctions,</HI></L>
<L>In <HI>Lillies</HI> Porch they &s;tand to do their functions.</L>
<L>With <HI>Prepo&s;ition;</HI> but the mo&s;t affection</L>
<L>Was &s;till ob&s;erved in the <HI>Interjection.</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Sub&s;tantive</HI> &s;eeming the limbed be&s;t,</L>
<L>Would &s;et an hand to bear him to his Re&s;t.</L>
<L>The <HI>Adjective</HI> with very grief did &s;ay,</L>
<L>Hold me by &s;trength, or I &s;hall faint away.</L>
<L>The Clouds of Tears did over-ca&s;t their faces,</L>
<L>Yea all were in mo&s;t lamentable <HI>Ca&s;es.</HI></L>
<L>The five <HI>Declen&s;ions</HI> did the Work decline,</L>
<L>And <HI>Told</HI> the <HI>Pronoun Tu,</HI> The work is thine:</L>
<L>But in this ca&s;e tho&s;e have no call to go</L>
<L>That want the <HI>Vocative,</HI> and can't &s;ay O!</L>
<L>The <HI>Pronouns</HI> &s;aid that if the <HI>Nouns</HI> were there,</L>
<L>There was no need of them, they might them &s;pare:</L>
<L>But for the &s;ake of <HI>Empha&s;is</HI> they would,</L>
<L>In their Di&s;cretion do what ere they could.</L>
<L>Great honour was confer'd on <HI>Conjugations,</HI></L>
<L>They were to follow next to the <HI>Relations.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Amo</HI> did love him be&s;t, and <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">cco</HI> might</L>
<L>Alledge he was his Glory and Delight.</L>
<L>But <HI>Lego</HI> &s;aid by me he got his skill,</L>
<L>And therefore next the <HI>Her&s;e</HI> I follow will.</L>
<L><HI>Audio</HI> &s;aid little, hearing them &s;o hot,</L>
<L>Yet knew by him much Learning he had got.</L>
<L>O <HI>Verbs</HI> the <HI>Active</HI> were, Or <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive</HI> &s;ure,</L>
<L><HI>Sum</HI> to be <HI>Neuter</HI> could not well endure.</L>
<L>But this was common to them all to Moan</L>
<L>Their load of grief they could not &s;oon <HI>Depone.</HI></L>
<L>A doleful Day for <HI>Verbs,</HI> they look &s;o <HI>moody,</HI></L>
<L>They drove Spectators to a Mournful Study.</L>
<L>The <HI>Verbs</HI> irregular, 'twas thought by &s;ome,</L>
<L>Would break no rule, if they were pleas'd to come.</L>
<L><HI>Gaudeo</HI> could not be found; fearing di&s;grace</L>
<L>He had with-drawn, &s;ent <HI>Maereo</HI> in his Place.</L>
<L><HI>Po&s;&s;um</HI> did to the utmo&s;t he was able,</L>
<L>And bore as Stout as if he'd been A <HI>Table.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Volo</HI> was willing, <HI>Nolo</HI> &s;ome-what &s;tout,</L>
<L>But <HI>Malo</HI> rather cho&s;e, not to &s;tand out.</L>
<L><HI>Po&s;&s;um</HI> and <HI>Volo</HI> wi&s;h'd all might afford</L>
<L>Their help, but had not an <HI>Imperative Word.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Edo</HI> from Service would by no means Swerve</L>
<L>Rather than fail, he thought the <HI>Cakes</HI> to Serve.</L>
<L><HI>Fio</HI> was taken in a fit, and &s;aid,</L>
<L>By him a Mournful <HI>POEM</HI> &s;hould be made.</L>
<L><HI>Fero</HI> was willing for to bear a part,</L>
<L>Altho' he did it with an aking heart.</L>
<L><HI>Feror</HI> excus'd, with grief he was &s;o Torn,</L>
<L>He could not bear, he needed to be born.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such <HI>Nouns</HI> and <HI>Verbs</HI> as we defective find</L>
<L>No <HI>Grammar</HI> Rule did their attendance bind.</L>
<L>They were excepted, and exempted hence,</L>
<L>But <HI>Supines,</HI> all did blame for negligence.</L>
<L><HI>Verbs</HI> Offspring, <HI>Participles</HI> hand-in-hand,</L>
<L>Follow, and by the &s;ame direction &s;tand:</L>
<L>The re&s;t Promi&s;cuou&s;ly did croud and cumber,</L>
<L>Such Multitudes of each, they wanted Number.</L>
<L>Next to the Corps to make th' attendance even,</L>
<L><HI>Jove, Mercury, Apollo</HI> came from heaven.</L>
<L>And <HI>Virgil, Cato,</HI> gods, men, Rivers, Winds,</L>
<L>With <HI>Elegies,</HI> Tears, Sighs, came in their kinds.</L>
<L><HI>Ovid</HI> from <HI>Pontus</HI> ha&s;t's Apparrell'd thus,</L>
<L>In Exile-weeds bringing <HI>De Tri&s;tibus:</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Homer</HI> &s;ure had been among the Rout,</L>
<L>But that the Stories &s;ay his Eyes were out.</L>
<L><HI>Queens, Cities, Countries, I&s;lands,</HI> Come</L>
<L>All Trees, Birds, Fi&s;hes, and each Word in <HI>Um.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What <HI>Syntax</HI> here can you expect to find?</L>
<L>Where each one bears &s;uch di&s;compo&s;ed mind.</L>
<L>Figures of Diction and Con&s;truction,</L>
<L>Do little: Yet &s;tand &s;adly looking on.</L>
