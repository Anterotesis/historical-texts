</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ONE peculiar excellency of the go&s;pel revelation is, that it opens a glorious pro&s;pect beyond the grave, where nature can &s;ee nothing but darkne&s;s. In tho&s;e gloomy regions where the light of nature (that is cried up by many) can &s;ee nothing but perpetual night, the go&s;pel opens a morning which &s;hall never have an evening.</P>
<P>Many of the heathen had &s;ome confu&s;ed notions of the future exi&s;tence of the &s;oul, but they never dreampt of the re&s;urrection of the body: Hence when the Apo&s;tle Paul was at Athens, that noted &s;eat of learning in the heathen world, though the Epicurean and Stoic philo&s;ophers could hear him upon other points, yet when he came to the doctrine of the re&s;urrection, they <HI>mocked</HI> at it, as a matter too ab&s;urd to de&s;erve a hearing. Such a mi&s;erable guide is fle&s;hly wi&s;dom! And &s;ince many

of the The&s;&s;alonians had been lately turned from tho&s;e dark ways, the Apo&s;tle takes care, among other important articles, to in&s;truct them in this great point, that they might not <HI>&s;orrow</HI> for their Chri&s;tian friends, <HI>as others which have no hope.</HI> No hope of ever &s;eeing or enjoying them again, as if they were lo&s;t in the grave. He does not forbid all &s;orrow; no, it is given as a mark of an aban|doned people, when the righteous were taken away, and <HI>no man laid it to heart.</HI> I&s;a. lvii. 1. Je&s;us him|&s;elf wept over his friend Lazarus, yet an immoderate &s;orrow is to be guarded again&s;t; <HI>for if we believe that Je&s;us died, and ro&s;e again, even &s;o them al&s;o which &s;leep in Je&s;us, will God bring with him.</HI></P>
<P>The particular occa&s;ion of my reading the&s;e words to you at this time, is the tidings I have ju&s;t re|ceived of the death of my dear godly mother <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Elizabeth Backus, of Norwich, who died January 26, 1769, in the 71&s;t year of her age.</NOTE>, though they afford many important in&s;tructions which de&s;erve the con&s;tant notice of every &s;oul. They may naturally lead us to con&s;ider what it is to be in Je&s;us; that death is but a &s;leep to &s;uch, and that God will wake them up, and bring them with him in the great day.</P>
<P N="1">1. What is it to be in Je&s;us? For if we are not fir&s;t in him, we cannot &s;leep in him. An&s;wer, 1. It is by faith to take him as our <HI>refuge</HI> from all evil. In our fallen &s;tate we like the <HI>&s;layer</HI> are expo&s;ed to the <HI>avenger</HI>'s &s;troke continually, from which no natural nor Chri&s;tian friends can &s;ecure us; our hou&s;es are no defence, neither are the &s;tronge&s;t holds that nature or art can afford: No|thing
<PB N="5" REF="011166_0004_0F857EA229199370">
but the refuge which God has provided can &s;ecure us. The city of refuge was an eminent type of our glorious Saviour, who by his obedience and &s;atisfaction has brought in an everla&s;ting righteou&s;|ne&s;s, which is unto all, and upon all them that believe; which &s;ecures them from the dreadful &s;entence of the law: For there is no condemnation to them which are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; yea his own mouth has declared, that they &s;hall not come into condemnation, but are pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life. <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 22. and viii. 1. <HI>John</HI> v. 24. Souls will not fly to this refuge till they &s;ee their dan|ger; hence appears the nece&s;&s;ity of the law, as a &s;chool-ma&s;ter to bring us to Chri&s;t. When I&s;rael heard its thunderings from Mount Sinai, they &s;aw that they &s;hould <HI>die</HI> if they had not one to &s;tand between God and them; and when any &s;oul effec|tually hears the law, it is alarmed to <HI>fly for refuge to lay hold upon the hope &s;et before us.</HI> Heb. vi. 18. A view of which hope will make the &s;oul gladly quit all its own &s;tuff, that it may win Chri&s;t, and be found <HI>in him.</HI> Phil. iii. 8, 9. Who is al&s;o a re|fuge from every enemy.</P>
<P>The &s;trong man armed would fain drag us to ruin, but Je&s;us has conquered him, and taken away all his armour, &s;o that he can't hurt any &s;aint. Indeed the &s;erpent will &s;hew his venom at their heel; but the God of peace &s;hall brui&s;e him under their feet &s;hortly. <HI>Rom.</HI> xvi. 20. Per&s;ecutors often take crafty coun&s;el again&s;t them, but 'tis in vain, for they are <HI>hidden ones:</HI> Their life is <HI>hid with Chri&s;t in God.</HI> P&s;a. lxxxiii. 3. Col. iii. 3. Believers are in the mid&s;t of a world of troubles, yet God is their refuge and &s;trength, and &s;uch a pre&s;ent help therein,
<PB N="6" REF="011166_0005_0F857EA35A2BDC10">
that he makes all to work together for their good. He is a wall of &s;ire round about them, and the glory in the mid&s;t of them: Which leads me to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">2. That to be in Je&s;us is to have a <HI>living union</HI> with him, as the branch hath with the vine. As natural life is lo&s;t when the union between &s;oul and body is di&s;&s;olved; &s;o our &s;piritual life was lo&s;t by revolting from God, and is recovered only by reconciliation and union with him. By the divine &s;pirit the &s;oul is cut off from nature's &s;tock, and grafted into Chri&s;t, the true vine, where|by they have &s;uch a vital union with him as to re|ceive &s;trength and nouri&s;hment from him, to bring forth fruit to the Father's glory; without which union and communion, they <HI>wither,</HI> and can <HI>do nothing.</HI> Rom. xi. 24. John xv.&mdash;The great Apo|&s;tle of the Gentiles &s;ays, <Q>I am crucified with Chri&s;t, neverthele&s;s I live; yet not I, but Chri&s;t liveth in me.</Q> And again, <Q>I al&s;o labour, &s;triving according to his working, which work|eth in me mightily.</Q> Tho&s;e who thus walk in Chri&s;t as they have received him, are truly happy in life, as no others are, and death is far from put|ting a period to their felicity; &s;o far from it, that it puts an end to all their toils and troubles, and brings them to their re&s;t. Hence ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">2. That death is but a <HI>&s;leep</HI> to tho&s;e who are in Je&s;us. This metaphor is often u&s;ed to de&s;cribe the &s;aints departure. Chri&s;t him&s;elf &s;aid, <Q>our friend Lazarus &s;leepeth.</Q> The aptne&s;s of the &s;imilitude may be &s;een in the&s;e particulars:</P>
<P N="1">1. Sleep is peculiarly for the body. While that is a&s;leep, the thoughts often rove far and wide, and &s;ometimes God has appeared to and conver&s;ed
<PB N="7" REF="011166_0006_0F857EA39E8C1568">
with the &s;oul while the body &s;lept; &s;o in this ca&s;e, when the body returns to the earth, the &s;pirit re|turns unto God who gave it. <HI>Eccl.</HI> xii. 7. Some have advanced a conceit of the &s;oul's &s;leeping with the body till the re&s;urrection, but that is a mo&s;t &s;tupid notion, contrary to the whole book of God. Our Saviour &s;hewed to the Sadduces, that God's &s;aying I <HI>am</HI> the God of Abraham, of I&s;aac and of Jacob, clearly proved that they then had a <HI>living</HI> exi&s;tence, as well as &s;hould hereafter have their bo|dies rai&s;ed. <HI>Luke</HI> xx. 38. And he &s;aid to the pe|nitent thief, <Q>to-day &s;halt thou be with me in Pa|radi&s;e.</Q> Al&s;o in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, he is &s;o far from countenancing this no|tion, that he &s;hews how hell-flames will wake up the &s;oul which was &s;tupid before, and give it a keen &s;en&s;e of its own torments, and apprehen&s;ion of the &s;aints happine&s;s, even while his brethren re|mained in this world, and needed to take warning of their danger.</P>
<P N="2">2. Sleep is for the night, after the &s;ea&s;on for la|bour is clo&s;ed. This life is often compared to a day, in which important labour and bu&s;ine&s;s is to be done, and it di&s;covers great &s;tupidity not to at|tend thereto in its &s;ea&s;on. Hence that &s;harp re|primand, "why &s;tand ye here all the day idle?" <HI>Matt.</HI> xx. 6. Je&s;us &s;pake and acted as a pattern for his people, when he &s;aid, <Q>I mu&s;t work the works of him that &s;ent me while it is day; the night cometh, wherein no man can work.</Q> Tho' we have not the &s;ame works in many re&s;pects to do that he had, yet each one has a work a&s;&s;igned him, by him who &s;ent us into the world, and what&s;oever our hand findeth to do, we ought to do with our
<PB N="8" REF="011166_0007_0F857EA49BA20538">
might, &s;ince there is no device, work or know+ledge in the grave, whither we are going.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;leep of a labouring man is &s;weet. It is emphatically &s;o with tho&s;e who have laboured for God, and have &s;pent their time and &s;trength in his &s;ervice. It is &s;aid of David, that, <HI>after he had &s;erved his own generation by the will of God, he fell a&s;leep.</HI> And he &s;ays or him&s;elf, <Q>thou art my hope, O Lord God; thou art my tru&s;t from my youth; I will hope continually, and will prai&s;e thee more and more. I will go in the &s;trength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy righteou&s;ne&s;s, even of thine only. O God, thou ha&s;t taught me from my youth; and hi|therto I have declared thy wondrous works: Now al&s;o when I am old and grey-headed, O God, for&s;ake me not, until I have &s;hewed thy &s;trength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.</Q> <HI>P&s;a.</HI> lxxi. 5, 14, 16&mdash;18. Thus he a&s;cribes all the honour to God in the fulle&s;t manner, while he enjoys great comfort in his own &s;oul, on a review of the part he had been enabled to act in life, and with a pro&s;pect of the glorious morning when he &s;hall be "brought up again from the depths of the earth." Ver&s;e 20. A like view made Paul &s;ay, <Q>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my de|parture is at hand.</Q> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 6&mdash;8.</P>
<P>I am far from thinking that rich grace may not now as well as formerly be di&s;played, if God will, at the la&s;t hour, to &s;uch as have &s;pent their life in &s;in, &s;o as to give a joyful pro&s;pect of glory; yet for &s;ouls to <HI>neglect the great &s;alvation,</HI> with a no|tion of obtaining &s;uch mercy hereafter, is an evil
<PB N="9" REF="011166_0008_0F857EA560785508">
which we have as great warnings again&s;t, as any one that is mentioned in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> How full to this pur|po&s;e is <HI>Prov.</HI> i. 22 to the end, and v. 11&mdash;14? O what di&s;tre&s;s can be like <HI>mourning at the la&s;t,</HI> with this keen reflection, <Q>how have I hated in&s;truction and my heart de&s;pi&s;ed reproof!</Q> Hence we have that call often inculcated, <Q>to-day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</Q> On the other hand, Peter enforceth his exhortation to the &s;aints, to give <HI>all diligence to add to their faith virtue,</HI> &amp;c. by this motive, <HI>that &s;o an entrance &s;hall be mini&s;tred unto you abundantly into the everla&s;ting king|dom of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And he thought it meet, as long as he was in this taberna|cle, to <HI>&s;tir them up,</HI> by putting them <HI>always in re|membrance</HI> of the&s;e things. 2 <HI>Peter,</HI> i. 5&mdash;13. Again,</P>
<P N="4">4. Sleep gives relief from the toils and troubles of the day; &s;o tho&s;e who <HI>die in the Lord, from hence|forth re&s;t from their labours.</HI> Rev. xiv. 13. Indeed here the antetype goes far beyond the type, for com|mon labourers have only a &s;hort re&s;pite, and then return to their ta&s;k again; but tho&s;e who &s;leep in Je|&s;us, from henceforth re&s;t for ever from their labours, yea, and from every thing di&s;agreeable; for they go where the wicked <HI>cea&s;e from troubling,</HI> and where the <HI>weary are at re&s;t.</HI> Yet 'tis far from the &s;luggard's paradi&s;e, for while the Prophet &s;hews, that, in oppo&s;ition to all unhappine&s;s, the righteous are taken away <HI>from the evil to come,</HI> and <HI>enter into peace and re&s;t in their beds,</HI> he &s;hews at the &s;ame time, that in di&s;tinction from all &s;tupidity, each one is <HI>walking in his uprightne&s;s.</HI> I&s;a. lvii. 2. The &s;oul is joining with angels, and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="011166_0009_0F857EA5F66D9FD0">
men made perfect, while the body &s;leeps in the du&s;t. And,</P>
<P N="5">5. Sleep is but for a night, to wake in the morn|ing with fre&s;h vigour: So &s;hall it truly be with the &s;aints. Though in this world they are often neglected or abu&s;ed by &s;uch as tru&s;t in their wealth, and boa&s;t them&s;elves in the multitude of their riches; yet Death &s;hall feed upon them, and the upright &s;hall have dominion over them, <HI>in the morning.</HI> P&s;a. xlix. 14. O glorious morning! Then will the righteous be <HI>&s;atisfied,</HI> when they awake in the divine <HI>likene&s;s.</HI> P&s;a. xvii. 15. Which leads us to con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="3">3. That God will wake up tho&s;e who &s;leep in Je&s;us, and bring them with him in the great day. This is the certain con&s;equence of Chri&s;t's death and re&s;urrection, which is the foundation of all our hopes. The re&s;urrection is not a doctrine of natu|ral, but of revealed religion, and is built upon God's promi&s;e through his Son, who therefore re|&s;olved the error of tho&s;e who formerly denied this doctrine into two points; their not knowing the <HI>&s;criptures,</HI> nor the power of God. <HI>Matt.</HI> xxii. 29. Not knowing the &s;criptures, which reveal it, nor the power of God, which will perform it. And tho&s;e who deny the re&s;urrection of the body in our day, err in the &s;ame points; but let infidels &s;et up rea&s;on again&s;t revelation ever &s;o much, and &s;ay, <Q>how can this fle&s;h, which moulders in the du&s;t, or is &s;cattered in the air or water, ever be rai&s;ed again?</Q> Yet if we believe that Je&s;us died and ro&s;e again, <HI>even &s;o</HI> them al&s;o which &s;leep in Je&s;us will God bring with him. He that gives up this doctrine forfeits the name of a Chri&s;tian, for if the
<PB N="11" REF="011166_0010_0F857EA6A81F7048">
dead ri&s;e not, then is not Chri&s;t rai&s;ed; and if Chri&s;t be not rai&s;ed, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your &s;ins. <Q>But now is Chri&s;t ri&s;en from the dead, and become the fir&s;t fruits of them that &s;lept.</Q> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 16, 17, 20. And as &s;urely as he aro&s;e and a&s;cended to heaven, &s;o &s;urely will he come again with power and great glory, and will &s;peak with &s;uch authority, that all who are in their graves &s;hall hear his voice, and come forth. <HI>John</HI> v. 28, 29. That morning will be as joyful to the righteous, as it will terrible to the wicked.</P>
<P>But how will the &s;aints then appear? Our ideas thereof are very imperfect. The beloved di&s;ciple &s;ays, <HI>it doth not appear what we &s;hall be, but we know that when he &s;hall appear we &s;hall be like him.</HI> Well that is enough for the heaven-born &s;oul, who&s;e language is, <Q>then &s;hall I be &s;atisfied, when I awake in thy likene&s;s!</Q> Yet the Apo&s;tle Paul has given &s;ome lively de&s;criptions of this affair, in 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 42&mdash;44. Alluding to the quickning of &s;eed that is &s;own, he &s;ays, <Q>it is &s;own in corrup|tion, it is rai&s;ed in incorruption; it is &s;own in di&s;honour, it is rai&s;ed in glory; it is &s;own in weakne&s;s, it is rai&s;ed in power; it is &s;own a na|tural body, it is rai&s;ed a &s;piritual body.</Q> 'Tis the &s;ame body, though gloriou&s;ly changed; therefore he adds, that <Q>this corruptible mu&s;t put on incor|ruption, and this mortal mu&s;t put on immortali|ty.</Q> And el&s;ewhere he tells us, that the Saviour &s;hall <HI>change our vile body, that it may be fa&s;hioned like unto his glorious body.</HI> Phil. iii. 21. Then &s;hall the &s;aints be &s;atisfied with likene&s;s to him, both in body and &s;oul, and he will <HI>bring them with him:</HI> None will be left behind, but all &s;hall be <HI>caught up
<PB N="12" REF="011166_0011_0F857EA75E9CD290">
together in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air;</HI> and &s;hall be openly acquitted and ble&s;&s;ed by the great Judge; and to crown the whole, &s;hall be EVER WITH THE LORD.</P>
<P>The&s;e things may teach us,</P>
<P N="1">1. The importance of looking each one to his own ca&s;e: Are we in Je&s;us or not? No que&s;tion can be of greater weight to us, therefore my friends pa&s;s it not over &s;lightly. Have you been made to know the dreadfulne&s;s of being without Chri&s;t, without God in the world? And have you been driven out of every other refuge, &s;o as to take &s;anctuary in Chri&s;t alone? One peculiar excellency of the knowledge of him is, that it transforms the &s;oul into his likene&s;s: Hence John gives this as the rea&s;on why the &s;aints <HI>know</HI> that when he &s;hall appear they &s;hall be <HI>like him,</HI> namely becau&s;e they &s;hall <HI>&s;ee him as he is.</HI> i. <HI>John,</HI> 3.2. The views they have of him now, through a gla&s;s darkly, cau&s;e a &s;elf-loathing for their former actings again&s;t him, and a longing after conformity to him in heart and life: Hence they ju&s;tly conclude, that when their views of him come to be perfect, their likene&s;s will be &s;o al&s;o; and this is the mark they &s;teer for, and the prize they pre&s;s after: Therefore the apo|&s;tle a&s;&s;erts in the next words, that, <HI>every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth him&s;elf even as</HI> HE <HI>is pure.</HI> Have we truly this hope or not?</P>
<P N="2">2. This doctrine may afford much &s;upport and encouragement to the faithful, in all their labours and &s;orrows here. The&s;e are but for a day, which is &s;wiftly pa&s;&s;ing, and though ye may bear the bur|then and heat of it, yet the &s;hadows of the evening draw on apace, when you &s;hall re&s;t from your la|bours,
<PB N="13" REF="011166_0012_0F857EA897052870">
and reap the happy fruits of them for ever. James's exhortation is full to this purpo&s;e: Having &s;poken of the &s;uffering which the ju&s;t are expo&s;ed to in this world, he turns to them and &s;ays, <HI>be pa|tient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord: Behold the hu&s;bandman waiteth for the precious fruits of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and the latter rain. Be ye al&s;o patient; &s;tabli&s;h your hearts; for the coming of the Lord draw|eth nigh.</HI> Jam. v. 7, 8. Doth the hu&s;bandman pur&s;ue his labours, and patiently go through the toils of &s;ummer with the hope of a future harve&s;t, and &s;hall not the believer &s;hew equal diligence and con&s;tancy in his father's vineyard? Did I &s;ay equal? Yea much greater; for the one labours for the meat that peri&s;heth, while the other's labours are for that meat which endureth unto everla&s;ting life, which the Son of Man &s;hall give unto them. <HI>John</HI> 6.27. The hu&s;bandman has no certain &s;ecurity but that all his labours may prove fruitle&s;s; but the exhortation to the &s;aints to be &s;tedfa&s;t and unmove|able, always abounding in the work of the Lord, is enforced with this motive, that <HI>ye know your la|bour is not in vain in the Lord.</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 58.</P>
<P N="3">3. What reproof may the&s;e things admini&s;ter, to tho&s;e who are wa&s;ting the hours of life in idle|ne&s;s or mi&s;chief, in&s;tead of regarding the great things which concern their peace? Many behave as if they had nothing to do but to live at ea&s;e, and gratify the fle&s;h upon the fruits of others labours: But this is as contrary to the end of our being, as death is to life; for tho&s;e who <HI>live in plea&s;ure, are dead while they live.</HI> They invert the true order of things, and <HI>&s;leep</HI> away the <HI>day,</HI> till ere they are
<PB N="14" REF="011166_0013_0F857EA903B1F7F8">
aware the <HI>night</HI> cometh, when no man can work. And alas! how doleful will that night be to them! An eternal night, without the lea&s;t re&s;t! They had been <HI>dreaming</HI> of many years of ea&s;e and merriment, till they <HI>&s;lipt into de&s;truction as in a moment, and are utterly con&s;umed with terrors.</HI> P&s;a. lxxiii. 18, 19. Once they had no ears to hear the cries of the poor or of the oppre&s;&s;ed, but now they will find that tho&s;e cries have entered into the ears of the Lord of ho&s;ts, who will avenge their cau&s;e.

They are beyond all danger of having their repo&s;e di&s;turbed for ever. They have done their work, and are receiving their reward; have fought the good fight, and are &s;hout|ing the glorious victory; and &s;hall we begrudge them their happine&s;s! Rather let us congratulate their &s;afe arrival to the realms of peace. Yet what will become of us who are left behind? The righ|teous are taken away from the evil to come. The &s;ame day that righteous Lot went out of Sodom, fire and brim&s;tone de&s;troyed them all; and the pro|phet &s;ays, <HI>except the Lord of ho&s;ts had left unto us a very &s;mall remnant, we &s;hould have been as Sodom.</HI> Sure|ly then 'tis a loud call to us when any of this rem|nant are taken away; and he is a &s;tupid creature who does not <HI>lay it to heart.</HI> But what &s;hall we lay to heart?</P>
<P N="1">1. We &s;hould lay to heart the <HI>evil of &s;in.</HI> Had we never known &s;in, we &s;hould not have known death.

Can we take this viper into our bo&s;oms! All our &s;orrows in life, and all the terrors of death, are but &s;o many di&s;coveries of what this mon&s;ter has done; and &s;till we &s;ee but a little part of his mi&s;chiefs. Look to Calvery, and behold the Prince of life in the agonies of death; a &s;cene which made the &s;un hide its face, the earth to quake, and the rocks to rend a&s;under; and &s;hall not this rend our rocky hearts!

<P N="2"><PB N="16" REF="011166_0015_0F857EAA5B7EB628">2. Let us lay to heart that <HI>time is &s;hort.</HI> Our fa|thers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live for ever? How many are already gone? We find they are daily going, and every one mu&s;t draw after them, as there are innumerable before them. We are all but tran&s;ient per&s;ons here, and are ha&s;ten|ing to another world, as fa&s;t as time can carry us; O therefore let us u&s;e the world as not abu&s;ing of it, for the fa&s;hion thereof pa&s;&s;eth away.</P>

What ble&s;&s;ings does our Lord pronounce on tho&s;e who are <HI>found watching?</HI> And James &s;ays, <HI>behold we count them happy which endure.</HI> Them who have endured the rage of earth and hell, and have end|ed their race with peace or with triumph, we count them happy: Well, &s;ays he, <HI>my brethren, take them for an example of &s;uffering affliction and of patience.</HI> Jam. v. 10, 11.

<P>The&s;e things de&s;erve the con&s;tant regard of eve|ry one, and they call for our &s;pecial and particular notice, who have been lately bereaved of a godly relative. Paul &s;peaks of &s;ome who were <HI>in Chri&s;t before him:</HI> And I have abundant rea&s;on to think that my dear Mother was in Chri&s;t before I was born; and when he granted a glorious vi&s;itation of

<HEAD>APPENDIX, CONTAINING SOME Memories of Mrs. BACKUS's Life.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. ELIZABETH BACKUS was de&s;cended from one of the fir&s;t planters of <HI>Norwich;</HI> and was born there on <HI>April</HI> 6, 1698. Her father, Mr. JOHN TRACY, was a man eminent for vital and practical religion, who died on <HI>March</HI> 27, 1726, with &s;uch comfortable views of another world, that he charged his friends to give him up, and not hold him any longer with their prayers. He was very &s;trict in the religious education of his fa|mily, which this daughter of his was ever thank|ful for as long as &s;he lived; yet &s;he was fully con|vinced that none of the&s;e things would &s;tand her in &s;tead in the trying day, without a new heart; and &s;he has often mentioned to her children a work of conviction and conver&s;ion which &s;he experienced about the year 1721. And though I have not met with any record thereof, yet in an old paper I find &s;he has &s;et down &s;ome hints of her &s;oul-exerci&s;es afterwards, which di&s;cover an early concern to have her heart as well as life conformed to God. In <HI>April</HI> 1725 &s;he writes thus; <Q>by afflictions of late I have been awakened to &s;ee I have been a&s;leep, and I de&s;ire to be humbled for my &s;in, and do de&s;ire the Lord would go on &s;till to awaken me,
<PB N="ii" REF="011166_0019_0F857EAE3A9E68A0">
and give me a humble, meek and quiet &s;pirit, which is in the &s;ight of God of great price.</Q> And &s;he &s;ets down this pa&s;&s;age from Mr. <HI>Wilcox:</HI> <Q>It is well for us that it is ill with us; if it were not bad, it would be wor&s;e. We ought to be thankful to God for cro&s;&s;ing us; for woe be to us if he let us alone; it is ten to one but hearts de&s;ires and lean &s;ouls would go together.</Q> To which &s;he &s;ubjoins the&s;e words: <Q>Some time ago I met with &s;ome cro&s;&s;es, which overcame me with melancholy, and almo&s;t di&s;abled me for the do|ing of any duty: I happened to &s;ee a pa&s;&s;age in Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>'s treati&s;e about overmuch &s;orrow, which convicted me of my &s;in in this matter: It was this; the cau&s;e, &s;ays he, is &s;inful impa|tience: Di&s;contents and cares proceed from a &s;in|ful love of &s;ome bodily intere&s;t, and not taking Heaven for a &s;atisfying portion.</Q></P>
<P>She was married to Mr. SAMUEL BACKUS <HI>Ja|nuary</HI> 18, 1716, with whom &s;he lived in great ami|ty, as well as con&s;iderable pro&s;perity, till he was taken away on <HI>November</HI> 24, 1740, when &s;he was left with eleven children, the younge&s;t being not &s;ix weeks old, and &s;he in &s;o weakly a &s;tate as not to be able to go to meeting till the next &s;ummer. However &s;he then found the truth of that word, <HI>though weeping endureth for a night, joy cometh in the morning.</HI> The morning of that glorious day of grace, in 1741, &s;hed its kind beams on her family, (as well as through the land) and hopefully brought a great part of her children to the &s;aving know|ledge of HIM, who is a father of the fatherle&s;s, as well as a judge of the widows, in his holy habi|tation. Some brief account of the&s;e things I find
<PB N="iii" REF="011166_0020_0F857EAEFB789FE8">
written with her own hand thus; <Q>In the fall of the year 1740 we were all taken &s;ick with the mea&s;les, and it plea&s;ed God to afflict me in taking away my hu&s;band. And now in this time of di|&s;tre&s;s I &s;aw &s;o much of the evil and wickedne&s;s of my own heart, that I thought God was ju&s;tly afflicting of me: I &s;aw I had been a&s;leep.&mdash;As I was walking in my hou&s;e in great heavine&s;s, the&s;e words were ca&s;t into my mind: <HI>In the world ye &s;hall have tribulation:</HI> They turned in my mind an hundred times, and were of great &s;upport to me. Again, as I was mu&s;ing on my own and fa|mily's circum&s;tances at pre&s;ent (being now left a widow, with many &s;mall children) and com|paring it with what it had been in times pa&s;t, I found di&s;content to ari&s;e in my heart; but all on a &s;udden it darted in my mind, what is required in the tenth commandment? Why &s;urely it requireth full contentment with our own condition. The&s;e words turned in my mind many times, until I felt a calm within, and I &s;aid, &s;urely I have rea|&s;on to ble&s;s God's name for his goodne&s;s to me.&mdash; And now &s;ome months after this having examin|ed my ca&s;e often, and comparing the ca&s;e of my &s;oul now with what it had been in months pa&s;t, I could freely &s;ay from my heart, I could not be willing to be again in that &s;leepy &s;tate of &s;oul to|wards God, and the things that concern my everla&s;ting peace, no not to be in the mo&s;t pro&s;|perous condition in temporal things that ever I was in all my life. Now I can &s;ay, I hunger and thir&s;t after the word, it is the delight of my &s;oul.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="011166_0021_0F857EAFB7E088F0">Thus our dear mother was taught and upheld by the divine hand, in the mid&s;t of an evil world; and has lived a little beyond three&s;core years and ten. Her po&s;terity have increa&s;ed to three&s;core, 52 of which are now living.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My beloved Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE ventured &s;o far to di&s;clo&s;e intimate friend&s;hip, as to give a few extracts, and &s;ome whole copies of letters, which in the cour&s;e of twen|ty years I have received from my dear mother; the originals of which, in her own hand-writing, you are welcome to &s;ee when you plea&s;e. The tedious di&s;tance of four&s;core miles deprived me of the privilege of daily conver&s;e with her, and of that enjoyment of her edifying example which others of you were favoured with; yet that di&s;advantage is now in &s;ome mea&s;ure balanced with above fifty kind epi&s;tles, wherein &s;he being dead yet &s;peaketh. Thus a kind Providence makes all things to work for our good. Had it not been for our former di|&s;tance, I &s;hould doubtle&s;s have been now more deprived of her company than I am; for I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he rarely if ever wrote to any that were near; and I am fully per&s;uaded, that no others can draw her true picture &s;o well as her own pen hath done it, not|with&s;tanding her little practice in writing. Others might no doubt have &s;et her off with more polite language, and in more gaudy colours; but that, like <HI>paint,</HI> mars true beauty. I &s;hall de&s;ire you to pa&s;s by her expre&s;&s;ions of &s;trong affection for a poor child, and fix your attention upon the lively features which &s;he has exhibited of a SINCERE CHRISTIAN.</P>
<P>What an union and due proportion appears in her of tho&s;e two great points, a tru&s;t alone in Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, with a &s;trict regard to holine&s;s? Who can more fully renounce all kind of dependence on their own doings, than &s;he often does? Yet let the legale&s;t produce an in&s;tance, if he can, of a more &s;trict and con&s;tant regard to a holy life, than &s;he
<PB N="xvi" REF="011166_0033_0F857EB8E31863E8">
has &s;hewn. Again, here is a &s;trong a&s;&s;urance unit|ed with great diligence. How un&s;haken was her confidence in her great Redeemer, which made her often &s;ay, "death is no terror to me;" while &s;he &s;till &s;aw the <Q>awfulne&s;s of trifling away time, and that a Chri&s;tian cannot enjoy God, and live in confor|mity to the world?</Q> She had higher motives to en|gage her to improve time well than the fear of peri&s;hing. Here al&s;o appears true humility, with|out dimini&s;hing of divine bounty. A feigned hu|mility often moves per&s;ons to deny or undervalue what God has wrought for them, or by them; while pride will influence the creature to take the creator's gifts to &s;et off &s;elf with. Few I believe have &s;teered clearer of tho&s;e extreams than our de|parted friend; and the nearer &s;he got to heaven, the lower &s;he lay before God and man; &s;eeing her|&s;elf "a loth&s;ome creature:" Not becau&s;e &s;he had fallen into any outward &s;candal; no, but becau&s;e &s;he had been <Q>working for &s;elf, when God's glory &s;hould have been <HI>all</HI> her aim:</Q> Therefore &s;he could &s;ay, I abhor my&s;elf; while her hope was &s;till firm in Chri&s;t. Hence what a harmony do we here &s;ee between godly &s;orrow and &s;piritual joy! Tho&s;e &s;criptures were eminently verified in her life, <HI>we glory in tribulation;</HI> and, <HI>as &s;orrowful, yet al|ways rejoicing.</HI></P>
<P>Mi&s;take me not, my friends, as though I was aiming to garni&s;h the &s;epulchre of a decea&s;ed pa|rent. My aim is as much above any &s;uch thing, as the poet's plan was above the <HI>painter</HI>'s work, with regard to Mr. <HI>Hervey</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>"<HI>Williams,</HI> 'tis your's to bid the canva&s;s wear.</L>

your attention to the <HI>beauties of holine&s;s,</HI> which &s;hined in her, that you may <HI>imitate</HI> her lively and lovely example. One of the mo&s;t artful me|thods that the enemies to the power of godline&s;s have taken in our day, to promote their &s;oul-de&s;troying &s;chemes, has been by repre&s;enting, that the indwel|lings of the Holy Gho&s;t, and his quickning and comforting influences, which tho&s;e &s;aints enjoyed that we read of in the bible, were favours peculiar to the days of in&s;piration, or to the &s;cenes of mar|tyrdom, and not to be expected in the&s;e times of rea&s;on and liberty; but as &s;uch notions are directly contrary to the current of &s;cripture, and exactly re|&s;emble the language of tho&s;e hypocrites who &s;aid, <HI>the Lord hath for&s;aken the earth, and the Lord &s;eeth us not,</HI> Ezek. ix. 9; &s;o the Lord hath not left him|&s;elf without a number of witne&s;&s;es, even in the&s;e li|centious times, to the divine reality of his &s;piritual, life-giving and &s;oul-comforting pre&s;ence with and in his &s;aints; among which I believe this mother in our I&s;rael ought to be reckoned as one: Who&s;e te&s;timony therefore, I think, ought not to be for|gotten nor concealed; e&s;pecially among her numer|ous po&s;terity, who are doubtle&s;s willing to enjoy the temporal legacies which &s;he has left them: And can one of them be willing to mi&s;s of this <HI>good part which &s;hall not be taken away!</HI> We are all in an evil world, where we are con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to

changes, troubles and death: And who would not think it a great favour, if &s;eized with extremity of pain, to have, <Q>&s;weet views and foreta&s;tes of God's love, and of the glorious man&s;ions above, &s;o that death &s;hould be <HI>no terror</HI> to them?</Q> or upon a &s;ud|den fall or &s;urprize, to have their <Q>&s;en&s;es all the while, and a &s;weet calm and peace of mind, &s;o as to feel as well plea&s;ed and contented with the Pro|vidence of God, as if vi&s;iting near friends?</Q> What are all the kingdoms and glories of this world in compari&s;on with &s;uch enjoyments! Well, my friends, this happine&s;s, and more than tongue can expre&s;s, is freely held forth in the go&s;pel, and the call is, <HI>O ta&s;te and &s;ee that the Lord is good!</HI> And ever remember that you are to come and eat <HI>with|out money and without price.</HI> In Chri&s;t there is the <HI>gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> to deliver from our greate&s;t guilt, and <HI>abundance of grace</HI> to clean&s;e our &s;ouls, and &s;upply all our needs, &s;o as to make us holy and happy for ever.</P>
<P>Man's foundation error is, an imagination that there is &s;omething better than the will of God; &s;ome <HI>way</HI> better at pre&s;ent to walk in than his pre|cepts, and &s;ome <HI>intere&s;t</HI> better than to be at his di&s;|po&s;al. This evil imagination moves us to go a&s;tray, and to turn every one to his own way, in&s;tead of &s;ubmitting to divine government; but the <HI>natural</HI> as well as <HI>moral</HI> con&s;equence of &s;uch conduct can't po&s;&s;ibly be any other than mi&s;ery; for when we pur&s;ue a &s;eparate intere&s;t of our own, we mu&s;t &s;up|port and defend it&punc; again&s;t all dangers and enemies. And oh! how dreadful the ta&s;k! How in&s;upport|able the burthen!</P>
<P><PB N="xix" REF="011166_0036_0F857EBC85E3DBB8">The friend we now mourn was well &s;en&s;ible of this, and therefore &s;aid, in a letter not before tran&s;cribed, dated March 24, 1757, <Q>I tell you I am quite &s;ick of my&s;elf, the more I am acquaint|ed with my heart.

And oh! my brethren and friends, let us all remember the doleful ca&s;e of the Jews, who boa&s;ted of being Abraham's children and Mo&s;es' di&s;ciples, while they neither believed Mo|&s;es' writings, nor performed Abraham's works. <HI>John</HI> v. 46. and viii. 39.

How inexcu&s;able then &s;hall we be found, if any of us neglect the great &s;alvation exhibited in the go&s;pel, which has been clearly &s;et before us, not only by public preaching, but al&s;o by lively examples of near friends!
