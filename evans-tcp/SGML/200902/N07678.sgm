<HEAD><HI>THE</HI> Second Part of the <HI>Quakers ASSISTING,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have undertook ro Vindicate the Con|duct of our worthy Citizens, I think there remains &s;omething more to advance, to Incomomi&s;e their Actions; and to &s;hew to the World the darefull Con&s;equences of the others Conduct. We mu&s;t all allow, that we are Subor|dinate to <HI>England;</HI> our Laws receive their E&s;&s;ence, i.e. Their very Life and Being from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Laws; therefore I &s;ay, while we are thus &s;ituated, it is impo&s;&s;ible to form Laws here Contrary to tho&s;e Laws: And where our Legi&s;lative body to agree together, form an Edict, and publi&s;h it as &s;uch, it could have no more Weight or Force here, then a &s;ingle Blank; becau&s;e there is nothing to &s;upport it; yet we derive from the E&s;&s;ence of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Laws, a Privelege to make &s;uch Acts, as may &s;erve our Nece&s;&s;ities or Occa&s;ions; but when they come upon Compotion with the Royal Laws, they mu&s;t all nuckle into Subordination. I look upon this nearly a &s;imelar Ca&s;e with the <HI>Quakers</HI> and their Society Rules: Notwith&s;tanding they are &s;atyriz'd by a &s;et of mean envious Lowliv'd Scriblers, I have Tran&s;cribed in the fir&s;t Place a Law; that was made in Heaven, and given to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> by GOD him|&s;elf; a Law that is binding (as I there ob&s;erved) to all Nations of People; a Law that it is impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="3" REF="009807_0003_0F7A551FD1A935B0">
for Man to be exempt from; he mu&s;t either &s;ubmit in mercy, or in Judgment: I &s;ay, this Law is the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and the mo&s;t binding, for the good of Indiveduals, in civil Society, of any Law that ever was Publi&s;h'd on Earth; i.e. <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hedeth Man's blood, by Man his blood &s;hall be &s;hed: If a Stranger or Sojourner live with thee, thou &s;halt love him as thy &s;elf.</HI> What can be more binding? Nay the Almighty has been &s;o particularly carefull of his Creatures, that he has &s;tampt the very Image of this Law in the Heart of every Man, and there it remains (until Men give them&s;elves up to utter Di&s;truction) that a Man cannot &s;ee his Neighbour in Danger of loo&s;ing that Life, which GOD hath de|creed &s;hall End in the Cour&s;e of Nature, without making him all the help in his Power; no more than he can take it from him: But if an Omi&s;&s;ion of that &s;ort &s;hould ever happen, what can be more convincing to the World, then that Per&s;on is, a party concern'd in the murder, or at lea&s;t con&s;ents to that horrid Crime, which brings him in equally guilty: The&s;e are undeniable Facts, and now I come to con&s;ider, the &s;everal Denominations of People, re&s;pecting wor&s;hip, as they have each of them Rules in their Society, &s;uiting their Inclina|tions to keep Matters in a good Decorum among their own Members, which is commendable: Yet when this univer&s;al Law calls for immediate &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion; it's impo&s;&s;ible the Society, Rules can in any &s;ort interfear, the one is an act in civil Society, the other only rules in the Religious, the one is In&s;tituted by Chri&s;tians, the other has the Pre|valance over both Chri&s;tians and Heathens, throughout the World. The one is in&s;tituted by
<PB N="4" REF="009807_0004_0F7A5520B7CA9BA8">
the great Creator of the Univer&s;e, an Irrepealable Law to the End of Time, for the well-being of his Creator's; the other is in&s;tituted by (&s;ometimes) well thinking Men, to keep their Members within the Bounds of good order: Then all tho&s;e Rules, in each Religious Society, that are good, mu&s;t be Con&s;equents of this Royal Law, and have &s;uch a near Unity and Affinity with it, that they Contri|bute mightily to the Propogation and Promulga|tion of it, they are &s;o incorporated with it, that its impo&s;&s;ible to &s;et them at Variance. How then can any Man be &s;o wretchedly blind, as to &s;up|po&s;e, that any Society of people can form Rules to bar again&s;t divine Ju&s;tice? well, that's what this <HI>Unmasker</HI> a&s;&s;erteth, when he &s;aveth; the <HI>Quakers</HI> for&s;ook their Principles in helping to &s;ave the Lives of their Neighbours: Then, I &s;ay, agreeable to the Import of his Arguments, or as he would fain have it, and if they had &s;tood Neuter, according to his faint Opinion of their Principles, they would not only have bar'd again&s;t this Divine Law, but would have bid open Defiance to it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> How|ever I &s;hall now undertake to &s;hew the Reader, wherein this Writer has cleared the <HI>Quakers</HI> from all the heavy Charges, he him&s;elf has thrown upon them; i.e. He &s;eemingly Evidenceth again&s;t them in a Chain of Satyrical invectives, without in&s;tan|cing one &s;ingle Fact: Nay, he proves no one Thing against them, wherein a &s;tandard by, can &s;ay, ill they have done; therefore I &s;ay, the whole Charge retorts upon him&s;elf, and he mu&s;t un|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> it: there is none el&s;e to &s;hare with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Man &s;eemingly Charges <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Ju&s;tice, with a Breach

of &s;ome one or more of the Laws, whereby he looks upon him&s;elf injured, the Court will require Facts produced, before they can give Judgment; and this Accu&s;er not being able to produce any Thing, more than calumnious Accu&s;ations, with|out <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ancing one &s;ingle fact, whereby the De|fendant hath broke any one Law, or even Tran&s;|gre&s;s'd the Rules of Morality, the&s; Defendant is im|mediately di&s;charged, and cleared of, and from, all the fal&s;e &s;eeming Accu&s;ations. (I ask what has clear'd him?) and an&s;wer, the Accu&s;ers own Evi|dences, given before the Bench, which was upon a &s;trict enquiry, no other but &s;landerous and un|warantable Expre&s;&s;ions, accompanied with bitter|ne&s;s of Heart again&s;t his Neighbour; Not one &s;ingle Fact proved; I look upon this to be a pa|rallel Ca&s;e with the <HI>Quakers</HI> and this Enemy to all good, who has been Stigmatizing that Society with being guilty of party Rage, publi&s;hing inflamatary Pamphlets, a&s;&s;erting many fal&s;hoods to &s;well the Current of prejudices, nearly a bla&s;phemer of GOD, and a beliar of the Holy GHOST; but has proved not one of tho&s;e Charges: Nay he has not pro|duced one &s;ingle po&s;ition, that has weight enough in it &s;elf, to per&s;wade me to forbare a&s;&s;erting, that they are all po&s;itive fal&s;hoods. Well, what fol|lows? Why a &s;hower of Rain, falling from the Clouds, mu&s;t lite &s;omewere. So mu&s;t the&s;e Ac|cu&s;ations, that have been uttered, by the Month of one of <HI>Baal</HI>'s prie&s;ts: They cannot be lo&s;t, they mu&s;t lite &s;omewere; (I ask were?) He has intirely cleared the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and accu&s;ed none el&s;e. I an&s;wer they mu&s;t return to the Place from whence

they came; there is none other place for them; i.e. The Dog mu&s;t lick up his own Vomit, and the Hog mu&s;t &s;till wallow in the Mire: And this is all I can find his long written Harrangue proveth, that he him&s;elf is, (and not the <HI>Quakers,</HI>) the promoter of party Rage, publi&s;her of inflamatery pamphlets, a&s;&s;erting many fal&s;hoods, to &s;well the Current of prejudices, nearly a Blasfamer of GOD, and a be|liar of the Holy GHOST. I think the D&mdash;l. acted in a very Ra&s;cally manner with this poor fellow; I quite pitty him; it was that Serpent &s;et him to work, in the very beginning; dictated his whole writing, which indeed might &s;eem &s;ome Ea&s;e or Help to him, for the pre&s;ent, becau&s;e he had no more to do, then to write after him, and at that Time doubtle&s;s &s;hewed a great deal of Love and Friend&s;hip to him; but behold! when his faithful Servants was like to be detected, and the Villan|ous Scheme brought to Light, that old Serpent &s;lipt (as the &s;aying is) his Neck out of the Halter, and leaves the <HI>Unmasker</HI> a condemned Criminal to an&s;wer for the whole, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Well what remains, but to con&s;ider in &s;peculation the Con&s;equence of that Horrid Act? May not the Hand of Divine Ju&s;tice afflict this Land of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> for the guilt|le&s;s blood that was &s;hed therein; I mean the blood of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that was &s;pilt at <HI>Lanca&s;ter;</HI> as he did <HI>I&s;rael</HI> with Famine or Pe&s;tilence, for the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Saul,</HI> in Slaying the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> who were in Al|liance with them. We may read in the 21. Chap. of the &s;econd Book of <HI>Samuel, that there was a Famine over the Land of</HI> Judea, <HI>for three Years; and when</HI> David <HI>enquir'd of the Lord into the Cau&s;e</HI>

<HI>of it,</HI> the An&s;wer was, <HI>it is for</HI> Saul <HI>and his bloody Hou&s;e;</HI> becau&s;e he &s;lew the <HI>Gibeonites.</HI> The King then called the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> and queried of them what he &s;hould do for them? In doing of which he might appea&s;e the Wrath of divine Ju&s;tice.) Their an&s;wer was <HI>the Man that con&s;umed us and that devi&s;ed again&s;t us; let &s;even Men of his Sons be deli|vered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the</HI> LORD, <HI>in</HI> Gibeah <HI>of</HI> Saul: <HI>This being done, the Lord was plea&s;ed, to ble&s;s the Land again."</HI> Here we &s;ee that the Inanimate Earth mu&s;t bear the Cur&s;e of GOD's Wrath, for a Time, untill the Blood of <HI>Saul</HI>'s nigh Relatives made the Aronement, for his Crime. Oh! my e&s;teemed Citizens, if that &s;hould be the Ca&s;e with us, how would you rejoice in &s;ecret, to feel the un&s;peakable Peace, that would ari&s;e in your Hearts, when Reflecting on that act of Ju&s;tice, in obediance to the Royal Law; I mean the &s;aving of the Lives of your Fellow-Creatures. I &s;ay, it mu&s;t afford hearty Satisfaction, to know your&s;elves clear of the Blood of all Men, and that you, by your hone&s;t Endeavours, and the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, hath protected and pre&s;erved the Lives of more than one hundred of your Neighbours. One other In&s;tance I &s;hall give; and that was on our own Continent, in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Government, where the <HI>Quakers</HI> were u&s;ed in the mo&s;t cruel Manner, that the Serpentine Nature in Man could invent, they bore cruel Whippings, cutting off their Ears, and &s;everal were murdered, and for no other rea|&s;on, then for their faithful obedience to CHRIST. And this was all acted by this <HI>Unmasker</HI>'s dear Brethren, <HI>viz.</HI> Envious, Malicious, Hard-hearted,

<HI>Pre&s;byterians.</HI> I don't remember ever reading, or bearing tell, that any one <HI>Quaker</HI> was ever put to Death, for his Religious Principles, but in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Government: beware, beware, my Country|men, keepthe Reins of Government out of the Hands of <HI>Pre&s;byterians;</HI> for I believe they never had it, but that one Time, &s;ince the building of <HI>Babel;</HI> and I pray, they never may have it more, until Time is &s;wallowed up in Eternity. Well what follows? Why the Judgment of GOD upon their Land, as I have heard one of their Inhabitants &s;ay; that the Land about <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> was as agreeable too, and bore, as good Wheat, as any Part of the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Colony: But &s;ince they had put the Quakers to Death, that &s;ame Ground has never brought fourth any Wheat to per&s;ection. This was in the Year 1659, and whether the Judgment will Terminate here, di|vine Wi&s;dom only knows. How convincing mu&s;t the&s;e Citations be, to every &s;olid thinking Man, that our worthy Citizens could have done no one Thing more plea&s;ing to GOD, then their joining together, as one Man, in Vindicating his Righteous Law, with their Hands and Hearts, lifted up to implore a Ble&s;&s;ing on their concentious Endeavours; for we &s;ee, by the above cited In&s;tances, that there is no Attonement to be made for Willfull murder, but by &s;heding the blood of the Murderer; or the Earth mu&s;t feel the weight of GOD's Wrath. Al|thoug King <HI>Saul</HI> had been dead a Number of Years, yet infinite Wi&s;dom, in his own Time, made the firtle Soil of Pala&s;tine become a dry and barren Land, for that one Man's cruel act; and that not parpi|trated on a &s;ingle <HI>I&s;realite,</HI> but on Strangers or So|journers,

i. e. a Parallel Ca&s;e with that at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> only with this odds, <HI>Saul,</HI> was King of <HI>I&s;real,</HI> and had the Rule of Government in his Hands, and it is &s;aid, he did it in his Zeal; whereas tho&s;e Rebels had no Power, but what they received from Lu|cifer: nor no Zeal but to vindicate their Ma&s;ters Cau&s;e: And as to the &s;econd In&s;tance, Hi&s;tory informs us, that the Judgments of GOD was evi|dently manife&s;ted, on &s;everal of tho&s;e wicked Men in being brought to &s;tange and untimely Deaths&punc; Their Governor, <HI>John Endicot,</HI> was vi&s;ited with a loath&s;ome Di&s;ea&s;e, in &s;o much that he &s;tunk alive, and &s;o died with Rottenne&s;s: <HI>Richard Billingham,</HI> which &s;ucceeded <HI>Endicot,</HI> &s;ome Years after went Di&s;|tracted, and &s;o he died: General <HI>Aderton</HI> was Rid|ing towards his own Hou&s;e, when his Hor&s;e took fright at a Cow, cro&s;&s;ing the Way, and threw him down &s;o violently, that he died, his Eyes being &s;tarted out of his Head, his Brains out of his No&s;e, his Tongue out of his Mouth, and his blood out of his Ears, <HI>John Norton,</HI> the high Prie&s;t of that infer|nal Clan had been at his Wor&s;hip-Hou&s;e, in the Fore|noon, and intended to go again in the Afternoon and as he was walking in his Hou&s;e, he fetched a great Groan, and leaned his Head again&s;t the Mantle-Tree of the Chimney, and was heard to &s;ay, the Hand or the Judgments of the LORD are upon me; the&s;e were his la&s;t Words, and died away Tho&s;e were &s;ome of the Chief leaders of that cruel Tribe of inhuman Butchers, who&s;e Catra&s;trophy I have given to my Readers; though but briefly.
