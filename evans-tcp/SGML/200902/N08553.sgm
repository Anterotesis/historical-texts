<P>AS Humility and Charity are con|nected together in their own Na|ture, as well as in Life and Practice; and as they are the Foundation of all other Virtues, and con&s;equently of va&s;t Extent and Influence in the Chri&s;tian Life, in which they can never be a&s;under: It is therefore mo&s;t convenient and ad|vantageous, that they &s;hould go Side by Side in the Two following plain Di&s;cour&s;es.</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>I^&s;^t. Epi&s;tle of St. PETER, v. 5.</HI></BIBL> &mdash;And be cloathed with Humility, for GOD re&s;i&s;teth the Proud, but giveth Grace to the Humble.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ST. <HI>Peter</HI> having given a &s;trict Charge to the Pre&s;|byters of the Church, to be faithful in the Di&s;|charge of their great and important Function, exhorts <HI>the Younger to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the Elder;</HI> and adds, <HI>yea, all of you be &s;ubject one to another, and be cloathed with Humility.</HI>&mdash;Implying that Humility is a Virtue of &s;uch large Extent and va&s;t Importance, that it is not only a Duty incumbent upon the younger and lower Sort, with regard to tho&s;e that are their Seni|ors and Superiors; but even upon every one with Regard to every one; and &s;hould &s;o influence us in
<PB N="4" REF="010938_0004_0F852B879915E7D0">
all our Deportment, that it &s;hould obviou&s;ly appear in all our Language and Behaviour; &s;o that, by a very appo&s;ite and expre&s;&s;ive Metaphor, we may be &s;aid to be even <HI>cloathed</HI> with it; and he enforceth his Exhortation with this Rea&s;on, that <HI>God re&s;i&s;teth the Proud, but giveth Grace to the Humble.</HI>&mdash;Let us then from the&s;e Words con&s;ider the Nature and Operations of Humility, and the Rea&s;ons that &s;hould induce us to the practice of it.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Nature</HI> of it, it con&s;i&s;ts as St. Paul accu|rately defines it, in <HI>not thinking of our&s;elves more highly than we ought to think;</HI> but <HI>in thinking &s;oberly,</HI> accord|ing to what we really are, and what God hath given us to be; <HI>according to the Mea&s;ure of Faith;</HI> i. e. in Proportion to the Talent God has committed to our Tru&s;t; and this we &s;hould do, <HI>without Partiality and without Hypocri&s;y.</HI> So that it con&s;i&s;ts in thinking, af|fecting and acting with Regard to our&s;elves, and e|very Thing that concerns us, according to the Truth; and is therefore the Ground and Foundation of all other Virtues, and doth, in Effect, comprehend them all. For if we think &s;eriou&s;ly of our&s;elves, as being what we really are, we &s;hall be deeply &s;en&s;ible, that we are of our&s;elves poor, blind, ignorant and un|thinking Creatures, and this will make us earne&s;tly de&s;irous of &s;piritual Knowledge, e&s;pecially of what concerns our be&s;t Good and Happine&s;s; and this will di&s;po&s;e us to &s;tudy the Holy Scriptures, which are the Word of God, and give an eager and &s;trong Attenti|on to the Divine In&s;tructions, and embrace <HI>the Truth as it is in Je&s;us in the Love of it;</HI> and <HI>like new born Babes de&s;ire the &s;incere Milk of the Word, that we may
<PB N="5" REF="010938_0005_0F852B8859ECEEB0">
grow thereby.</HI>&mdash;We &s;hall moreover, be deeply &s;en&s;ible of our great Weakne&s;s, and extreme Impotence, and Inability to help our&s;elves, being exceeding irre&s;olute and un&s;table, and ea&s;ily and frequently borne down by Temptations, into &s;inful Compliances, and this will make us &s;en&s;ible how much we need the con|&s;tant Pre&s;ence and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's Holy Spirit, and be frequently looking up to him, and crying earne&s;tly to him for his Help upon all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Furthermore, if we are truly humble, and think rightly of our&s;elves, as being what we really are, we &s;hall have a mortifying Sen&s;e of <HI>the Plague of our own Hearts;</HI> the Prevalence of Pride and Pa&s;&s;ion; of our ba&s;e Lu&s;ts and corrupt Affections; and this will make us <HI>watch</HI> as well as <HI>pray that we enter not into Temptation,</HI> that they <HI>may not have Dominion over us;</HI> and wherein&s;oever we have been mi&s;led by them, in|to any wicked Practices; as in many, <HI>many Things we offend all;</HI> we &s;hall have a deep and &s;orrowful Sen&s;e of the va&s;t Load of Guilt that we have contracted, which will make us walk in deep Aba&s;ement every Day, and we &s;hall find no Re&s;t to the Sole of our Foot, 'til we turn about and amend, and obtain &s;ome good Hopes of Pardon and Reconciliation with God, on who&s;e Favour (if we have any Sen&s;e at all) we mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that all our Happine&s;s, and all our Hopes intirely depend.&mdash;But then, alas! if we duly con&s;ider, and rightly think of this Affair, what Hopes can we conceive of his Favour to &s;uch guilty, po|luted Wretches, merely from the Con&s;ideration of his Goodne&s;s and Mercy, while at the &s;ame Time, we are in the Hands of his Ju&s;tice, and actually un|der
<PB N="6" REF="010938_0006_0F852B892545EE60">
the Sentence of Death for our pa&s;t Rebellion, and there is nothing we can do for the future, how|ever &s;o penitent and obedient we may propo&s;e to be, that can ever attone for what is pa&s;t, or cancel the Debt we have contracted, or &s;atisfy the divine Ju&s;|tice, who&s;e &s;acred Laws we have outrageou&s;ly violat|ed, and who&s;e mo&s;t high Authority we have trampled under our Feet!</P>
<P>What un&s;peakable Comfort mu&s;t it then be, under the&s;e aba&s;ing Convictions, to hear, that God <HI>hath laid Help upon One, who is mighty to &s;ave,</HI> and that his own ble&s;&s;ed Son hath <HI>taken upon him&s;elf the Iniquities of us all,</HI> and made an Attonement for our crying Sins, by the Sacrifice of him&s;elf? And with how much Gratitude and Devotion will a truly humble and contrite Sen&s;e of our Sinfulne&s;s bring us to lie pro&s;|trate at the Foot of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, looking for Pardon and Mercy only thro' his all-&s;ufficient Merits and Mediation?</P>
<P>Thus will true Humility di&s;po&s;e us to give all the Glory to God's free Grace in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who alone hath redeemed us out of the Hands of Ju&s;tice, and put us into a Capacity of obtaining Mercy; a deep Sen&s;e of which mu&s;t engage us with the mo&s;t ardent Love and Gratitude to devote our&s;elves to be his faithful and obedient Di&s;ciples as long as we have a Being.</P>
<P>Moreover, if we rightly think of our&s;elves, and our Condition in this World, as being what it really is, we &s;hall have, and con&s;tantly carry about us, a weigh|ty and humbling Sen&s;e of our Mortality and Mi&s;ery; of the many Sickne&s;&s;es and Infirmities, and the many
<PB N="7" REF="010938_0007_0F852B89D81E7BF8">
Ca&s;ualties, Lo&s;&s;es, Cro&s;es, and Di&s;appointments to which we are daily and hourly expo&s;ed&mdash;the great Uncertainty of our Lives and Health of our deare&s;t Friends and Relatives, and all our Enjoyments, and the Certainty of our Death to which we are every Moment liable.</P>
<P>If we had a piercing Sen&s;e of the&s;e Things, it would be &s;ufficient to take down all the Pride of our Hearts, all our Conceitedne&s;s and Self-&s;ufficiency, and all our towering Thoughts of our&s;elves, and we &s;hould have little Heart to pride our&s;elves in fine Clothes, and gay Apparel, and running into every fooli&s;h extravagant Fa&s;hion, that this &s;illy Age is con|tinually inventing, and we &s;hould literally <HI>be cloathed with Humility&punc;</HI></P>
<P>How would a humble Sen&s;e of the&s;e Things wean us from this uncertain World, and the&s;e dying Bodies? How would it engage us to redeem the Time, and make the be&s;t of every Moment, &s;ince <HI>we know not what a Day may bring forth?</HI>&mdash;How would it engage us amid&s;t &s;o much Uncertainty to make &s;ure of &s;ome Thing? And &s;ince we can be &s;ure of Nothing on this Side the Grave, how would it put us upon &s;e|curing that <HI>durable Riches and Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> which a|lone will &s;tand us in Stead, when this vain Word, with all its empty Toys &s;hall be at an End with us? We &s;hould then con&s;ider the Intere&s;ts of our immor|tal Souls, which are truly Our&s;elves, and the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, which is Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, to be of infinitely more Weight and Importance than any of the Gratifications of our bodily Appetites, or any of the little Intere&s;ts or Concerns of this vain
<PB N="8" REF="010938_0008_0F852B8A92FC2350">
and tran&s;itory World, and this would make us meek and patient under all its Frowns.&mdash;Such would be the Operations and Effects of true Humility, with Regard to our&s;elves, if our Hearts were thoroughly &s;ea&s;oned with it.</P>
<P>Let us now go on and con&s;ider how this ble&s;&s;ed Temper of Humility would operate with Regard to God. If we truly knew our&s;elves, and had moreover a ju&s;t and piercing Sen&s;e of his infinite Excellency, and inconceivable Greatne&s;s, Maje&s;ty and Glory, and of our own Nothingne&s;s and Vilene&s;s; of his in|finite Purity and Holine&s;s, and of our own Polution and Sinfulne&s;s, and at the &s;ame Time were deeply &s;en|&s;ible of our intire Dependence upon him, &s;o that we cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t a Moment without him, and have <HI>no Sufficiency of our&s;elves, &s;o much as to think any Thing as of our&s;elves,</HI> and of his infinite Fullne&s;s and All &s;uffici|ency to all the Purpo&s;es of our Sub&s;i&s;tance and Hap|pine&s;s. I &s;ay, if we rightly con&s;idered what God is, and what we are, and how we &s;tand related to him, and dependent upon him, how would it lay us pro&s;|trate before Him, and make us Nothing in our own Eyes, and content and rejoice to acknowledge Him to be all in all? How would it a&s;toni&s;h us to think, that ever we &s;hould venture to contemn his mo&s;t high Authority, and violate his mo&s;t holy, his mo&s;t righteous &amp; rea&s;onable Laws, and in&s;pire us with true Contrition for our pa&s;t Offences, and a mo&s;t filial and dutiful Di&s;|po&s;ition and Re&s;olution to be in all Things intirely devoted, to be conformed and obedient to him for the future, as far as po&s;&s;ible? How would it fill us with Love and Gratitude to Him as our great Benefactor,
<PB N="9" REF="010938_0009_0F852B8B57EC38C8">
and our chief Good, and with Tru&s;t and Dependence upon Him as our only Stay and Support? How would it make us contented with all his Allotments, and acquie&s;ce in all his Di&s;pen&s;ations, and be all Submi&s;|&s;ion and Re&s;ignation to his holy and ble&s;&s;ed Will, both in his Commands and Providences, as well as patient under his Cha&s;ti&s;ements? How careful &s;hould we be not to do any Thing di&s;plea&s;ing to the pure Eyes of his Glory, or to harbour the lea&s;t Stubborn|ne&s;s or Untowardne&s;s of Temper, or any Thing in|con&s;i&s;tent with our Duty to Him; but willingly re|&s;ign up <HI>every Imagination</HI> to be <HI>captivated to the O|bedience of the Go&s;pel?</HI> we &s;hould then take Care above all Things not only, <HI>to do ju&s;tly and love Mercy, but to walk humbly with our God,</HI> and in all our <HI>Ways to acknowledge him,</HI> and confide in Him to <HI>direct us in all our Steps,</HI> and live in the daily exerci&s;e of Prayer and Prai&s;e, with the lowe&s;t Pro&s;tration of Soul, which would properly expre&s;s and exerci&s;e, as well as im|prove and cultivate this ble&s;&s;ed Temper of Humility.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, let us con&s;ider how true Humility will operate with Regard to others, as well as to God and our&s;elves. And as to this, if we truly know our|&s;elves, and do <HI>not think of our&s;elves more highly than we ought to think,</HI> we &s;hall con&s;ider all Men, and e&s;peci|ally all Chri&s;tians, as our Brethren, as Children of the &s;ame common Parent, however low and mean they may be in outward Circum&s;tances; and this will di&s;po&s;e us to look on every One with a Brother's Tenderne&s;s and Benevolence. We &s;hall be &s;o far from Haughtine&s;s and Superciliou&s;ne&s;s, or de&s;pi&s;ing any One for the Poverty or Meanne&s;s of his Con|dition, that we &s;hall rather pity and compa&s;&s;io|nate
<PB N="10" REF="010938_0010_0F852B8C130892E8">
him, and treat him with the greater Tender|ne&s;s and Conde&s;cention, con&s;idering <HI>who it is that made us to differ,</HI> and <HI>what we have that we did not re|ceive,</HI> and do not hold from his di&s;tingui&s;hing Bounty and Goodne&s;s, and that we have <HI>nothing to glory in, as though we received it not.</HI> And indeed there is nothing that betrays &s;o much Ignorance both of God and our&s;elves, nothing that di&s;covers &s;o much Mean|ne&s;s, Ba&s;ene&s;s and Narrowne&s;s of Spirit, as Haughti|ne&s;s of Carriage towards tho&s;e that are below us, and Contempt of the Ignorant and Needy, and of the Poor, the Friendle&s;s and Forlorn; as on the other Hand, true Humility is true Greatne&s;s of Spirit, there being nothing more God-like than a kind, conde&s;|cending Tenderne&s;s and Fellow-feeling with our poor Neighbours in all their Difficulties and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, joined with a Readine&s;s to do all that we can for their Comfort and Relief. Hereby we al&s;o mo&s;t re&s;emble Chri&s;t, when like him, we tenderly compa&s;&s;ionate the mo&s;t abject Mi&s;ery, and &s;ubmit to the lowe&s;t Offices for the Sake of doing the greate&s;t Good. Let us therefore take his <HI>Yoke upon us, and learn of him to be meek and lowly of Heart as he was;</HI> and let <HI>the &s;ame Mind be in us which was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> who tho' <HI>he was in the Form of God,</HI> yet conde&s;cended to take <HI>up|on him the Form of a Servant,</HI> in order to recover a lo&s;t and undone World, and &s;o far <HI>humbled him&s;elf as to become obedient to Death, even the Death of the Cro&s;s,</HI> that we might be re&s;cued from eternal Death, and live forever.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, a truly humble Spirit is ever a peace|able and forgiving Spirit. Humility and Charity are truly Si&s;ter-Graces, clo&s;ely connected in the &s;tricte&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="010938_0011_0F852B8CDA197138">
Harmony and Friend&s;hip; &s;o that where the one is, you are &s;ure to find the other. For, <HI>whence come Wars and Fightings,</HI> Quarrels and Contentions, but from our ba&s;e Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions; from Pride and Stubborne&s;s, and from an unconde&s;cending Spirit? And did Men with true Humility and Contrition of Heart, con&s;ider their own Guilt and Pollution, and duly reflect on their own many, great and heinous Of|fences again&s;t God, and in how great Need they &s;tand of his Forgivene&s;s, how ready and glad would they be to forgive and be reconciled one to another. Thus you &s;ee how Humility operates, and how many Ways it exerts and di&s;covers it&s;elf, and that it is indeed the Ground and Foundation of Charity, and of all other Graces and Virtues, which derive from them both.</P>
<P>And this alone would be Rea&s;on &s;ufficient, if there was nothing el&s;e, to induce us to cultivate it, which was to be the <HI>la&s;t</HI> Head of my Di&s;cour&s;e. For &s;ince all our Happine&s;s, and all our Hopes, in Time &amp; to all Eternity depend intirely, next to God, upon the uniform Prac|tice of every Grace and Virtue, it mu&s;t e&s;pecially de|pend on Humility as the Ground and Foundation of them all. But let us particularly con&s;ider the Mo|tive St. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;ugge&s;ts in my Text, that <HI>God re&s;i&s;teth the Proud, and giveth Grace to the Humble.</HI> The Proud, the Conceited and Self-&s;ufficient, as being the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable and incon&s;iderate Set of Men, are God's peculiar Aver&s;ion; he <HI>beholdeth them afar off,</HI> as they do e&s;pecially bear the Image of the Devil, who&s;e Pride occa&s;ioned his Fall. And as Pride begun the Rebelli|on in Heaven, &s;o it is Pride that hath carried it on upon Earth, ever &s;ince Man joined with the Devil in his Apo&s;tacy. For as Humility is the Root and enters
<PB REF="010938_0012_0F852B8F67235920">
into the Nature of every Virtue; &s;o Pride is the Root, and its helli&s;h Nature operates in every Vice, and indeed renders all that are tainted with it utterly unqualified for the Grace and Favour of God. Where|as the <HI>Humble are his Delight: For thus &s;aith the High and Lofty One who inhabiteth Eternity, who&s;e Name is Holy, I dwell in the high and holy Place; with him al&s;o who is of a contrite and humble Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the Humble, and to revive the Heart of the contrite Ones.</HI> And <HI>to this Man will I look,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>even to him that is poor,</HI> or lowly in his own Eyes; <HI>to him that is poor and of a contrite Spirit and who trembleth at my Word.</HI> Such a ble&s;&s;ed Thing is Humility that &s;o di|rectly qualifieth us for the peculiar Favour and gra|cious Regards of Almighty God! and <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in Spirit, for their's is the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed &s;uch is the amiable Nature of Humili|ty that there is nothing like it to recommend us to the Favour and E&s;teem, and the good Will and Friend&s;hip of all Men, as well as of God him&s;elf. The Man that is <HI>cloathed with Humility,</HI> di&s;covering it &s;elf in all his Words, Actions and Deportment, who can behold him and not love him and confide in him; Whereas the Proud, the Conceited and Vain, are ever contemptible, and de&s;pi&s;ed and hated of all Man|kind; none can endure them, or be ea&s;y in their Company, but every One &s;huns and avoids them. Ju&s;t in Proportion as they extol or make a vain Shew of them&s;elves, they are de&s;pi&s;ed and derided of others. And no Wonder, for they are con&s;idered (which in|deed they are) as poor deluded Wretches. What a contemptible Character is that of <HI>Laodicea? Thou &s;aye&s;t I am rich and increa&s;ed in Goods, and &s;tand in need of Nothing, and knowest not that thou art wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked;</HI> contempti|ble
<PB REF="010938_0013_0F852B9054C6E4B8">
in the Sight of God, and even &s;o in the Sight of Men; but God knoweth the Heart. So that if Men had no other View than their own Intere&s;t and Re|putation, they would abhor, and guard again&s;t Pride, and cultivate Humility; how much more if they had with all, any Concern to recommend them&s;elves to the Favor of God?</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, let us con&s;ider the different and contrary Fates of them, the one and the other. <HI>Solomon,</HI> tells us, <HI>Pride goeth before De&s;truction, and a haughty Spirit before a Fall.</HI> This is what is often ob&s;erved in this World, that by how much the more any have indulged this hateful Spirit, and made a vain Show of them&s;elves, by &s;o much the nearer were they to &s;ome &s;ad Cata&s;trophe; &s;ome fatal Downfal, which proved &s;o much the more di&s;a&s;trous and con&s;picuous, by how much the higher they had got upon the Pinacle of Pride: But if they never fell before, they will have a mo&s;t dreadful Downfal indeed, when they go off the Stage; having been <HI>lifted up to Heaven, they &s;hall be brought down to Hell.</HI> On the other Hand, the &s;ame wi&s;e Man ob&s;erves, <HI>before Honour is Humility.</HI> Humi|lity is the &s;ure&s;t Way we can take to advance our|&s;elves, and our Advancement &s;hall be the greater, by how much the more we aba&s;ed our&s;elves; for a great|er and wi&s;er than he hath a&s;&s;ured us, That <HI>every one that exalteth him&s;elf &s;hall be aba&s;ed, but he that humbleth him&s;elf &s;hall be exalted.</HI> Let us therefore, my Bre|thren, be advi&s;ed by St. <HI>Peter,</HI> every Day that we live, to <HI>humble our&s;elves under the mighty Hand of God, that he may exalt us in due Time:</HI> for in this Ca&s;e, however depre&s;&s;ed our Condition may be in this World, to the very la&s;t, we may depend upon it, that at length, from the lowe&s;t State on Earth, God will exalt us to the tran&s;cendant Glories of Heaven.</P>

<HEAD>A SERMON on the Nature, Im|portance, and Grounds of Charity.</HEAD>
<P>The following Di&s;cour&s;e was preached and printed at the De&s;ire of the FREE-MASONS at <HI>Stratford,</HI> on St. <HI>John's</HI> Day, <HI>June</HI> 24, 1767. And introduced with the&s;e Words, after the Text,</P>
<P><HI>My Friends and Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I Ob&s;erve from your Hi&s;tory and Con&s;titutions, that you profe&s;s to be a Fraternity of Charity, as your great Aim. I cannot therefore do better than entertain you on that important Subject, which will teach you what it is to be Ma&s;ons indeed; to build up that glorious and heaven|ly Building, the Chri&s;tian Church, which is the Body of Chri&s;t, (of which <HI>Solomon's</HI> Temple was the Type) which Church of Chri&s;t, St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us is <HI>built upon the Foundation of the Apo&s;tles and Prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the chief Corner Stone.</HI></P>

<P>CHARITY is a Thing, in the full Extent of it, of that va&s;t Importance, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to con|&s;ider it in every Light, and to give the &s;tronge&s;t At|tention to it in every View. I &s;hall now con&s;ider it, as the Aim and End of the Go&s;pel, and with Regard

<P>The Apo&s;tle here tells <HI>Timothy</HI> that he had de&s;ired him to take up his Re&s;idence at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> i. e. as the Bi&s;hop of that Church (as all Antiquity witne&s;&s;eth) it being a City of large Extent and great Importance, that he might build on the Foundation he had laid; &amp; particularly that he might guard them again&s;t the In|&s;inuations of corrupt Teachers, and <HI>charge</HI> or denounce to them <HI>that they &s;hould not teach any other Doctrine,</HI> than the pure Doctrine of the Go&s;pel, which he had taught them; that they &s;hould not turn a&s;ide to endle&s;s Ge|nealogies and Fables which were apt to create Di&s;|putes and Contentions, and &s;o to occa&s;ion Divi&s;ions, and Separations, and &s;o fru&s;trate the very Intention of the Go&s;pel, which was to promote univer&s;al Love and Charity; for, &s;ays he, the very <HI>End</HI> of the Go&s;pel, and con&s;equently of the Charge <HI>Timothy</HI> was to give them, was <HI>Charity out of a pure Heart and a good Con&s;cience and Faith unfeigned.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Commandment</HI> then which the Apo&s;tle here means is the whole go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation, implying that entire Sy&s;tem of Chri&s;tian Doctrine, which St. <HI>Paul</HI> had preached during the two Years that he had re&s;ided there, and which <HI>Timothy</HI> was to charge them to adhere to, and the <HI>End</HI> of this he tells us is <HI>Charity,</HI> and this is the &s;ame as to &s;ay, that Charity is the Per|fection of Chri&s;tianity, for a Thing is then perfected, when its End or Intention is an&s;wered. This there|fore teacheth us that Chri&s;tianity without Charity is but an empty Name, and an unmeaning Thing. Hence it is, that he &s;ays in the 13th of the 1&s;t to the Corin|thians, <HI>Tho' I have the Tongue of Men and Angels, and
<PB N="16" REF="010938_0016_0F852B9BC052F260">
have not Charity, I am but as &s;ounding Bra&s;s, and a tinkling Cymbal, and though I have all Faith &s;o that I could remove Mountains, and have not Charity, I am Nothing.</HI> Nay, &s;ays he, <HI>tho' I give all my Goods to feed the Poor, and</HI> even <HI>my Body to be burnt, and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing.</HI> It is therefore of the utmo&s;t Importance that we con&s;ider carefully what this Charity really is, that he lays &s;o much Stre&s;s up|on; for it is plain from the&s;e Words, that it would be a mi&s;erable Thing indeed to be deceived about it.</P>
<P>Now it is plain from this Text, that the Apo&s;tle means &s;omething more than <HI>giving our Goods to feed the Poor;</HI> nay, &s;omething of greater Importance than preaching the Go&s;pel ever &s;o eloquently; nay, &s;ome|thing of greater Weight and Worth, than even dying in the Cau&s;e of it, <HI>by giving our Bodies to be burnt;</HI> and &s;omething that a Man may do all the&s;e Things, and yet be de&s;titute of it. What then can it be? &mdash; I an&s;wer, it means an <HI>intire Habit of Benevolence, or good Will exerted, not in &s;ome few In&s;tances only, however &s;o &s;plendid, but univer&s;ally in all its Branches toward God and Man, and attended with all its ble&s;&s;ed Fruits.</HI> It is not, now and then a few tran&s;ient Acts, but it is a &s;ettled Habit or Frame of the Soul; a Soul that hath no other than an entire well-meaning, and is of &s;uch a di&s;intere&s;ted and unbia&s;ed Love and Good-Will, that it hone&s;tly aims at the Truth and Right of the Ca&s;e in every Thing that it thinks, &s;peaks and does; a Soul that is intirely devoted, as far as human Frail|ty can go, to be governed by that <HI>Wi&s;dom which is from above,</HI> which <HI>is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gentle, ea&s;y to be entreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality and without Hypocri&s;y:</HI> &s;o St. <HI>James</HI> de&s;cribe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="17" REF="010938_0017_0F852B9C7372E218">
it. It is not therefore &s;o properly any particular Vir|tue, as an habitual Temper or Frame of the Soul, from whence as from a Fountain, every Virtue flows; or a &s;teady fixed Principle from whence every Thing that is truly pious, virtuous and amiable in Life per|petually derives; <HI>What&s;oever Things are true; what|&s;oever Things are hone&s;t, what&s;oever Things are ju&s;t, what|&s;oever Things are pure, what&s;oever Things are lovely, what&s;oever Things are of good Report, if there be any Virtue, if there be any Prai&s;e;</HI> all the&s;e Things con|tinually flow from it, as their living and never failing Source. Hence St. <HI>Paul</HI> de&s;cribes this mo&s;t amiable Principle of <HI>Charity</HI> in the following mo&s;t beautiful Manner; <HI>Charity &s;uffereth long and is kind,</HI> &s;ays he. <HI>Charity envieth not; Charity vaunteth not it&s;elf; is not puffed up; doth not behave it&s;elf un&s;eemly, &s;eeketh not her own; is not ea&s;ily provoked; thinketh no Evil; rejoic|eth not in Iniquity, but rejoiceth in the Truth: beareth all Things; believeth all Things; hopeth all Things; endureth all Things, and Charity never faileth.</HI> Such are the admirable and mo&s;t delightful Properties of this divine Principle of Charity!</P>
<P>But alas! if this be Charity, where is &s;he fled? where &s;hall we &s;eek to find her? Time was when &s;he dwelt on Earth, when Chri&s;tianity was in its greate&s;t Vigour and Purity, and in its primitive Glory and Simplicity. But if we look on the pre&s;ent Condition of Things, one would be apt to think, &s;he is long &s;ince fled to Heaven! She is hardly now to be found on Earth, unle&s;s in a few <HI>humble and holy Men of Heart.</HI> Certainly the very be&s;t of us are extremely deficient, and fall &s;adly &s;hort of coming up to this amiable Cha|racter, wherein the true Beauty, and Glory of Chri&s;|tianity con&s;i&s;ts. Were we but animated with this di|vine
<PB N="18" REF="010938_0018_0F852B9C987E9D58">
Principle, as above de&s;cribed, we &s;hould <HI>abhor e|very Thing that is evil, and cleave to every Thing that is good:</HI> we &s;hould not only <HI>do ju&s;tly,</HI> but <HI>love Mercy, and walk humbly with our God.</HI> &mdash; The lea&s;t Thing that Chari|ty would put us upon, would be to do no Injury; to be intirely inoffen&s;ive in all our Behaviour; to a|void every Thing that might any Way di&s;oblige one another, and much more what&s;oever could be any Way hurtful to our Neighbours, whether in Soul, Body or E&s;tate. I &s;ay the&s;e are the lowe&s;t Offices of Charity. So far from all that is wrong, that we &s;hould be very careful to &s;ay and do always what is right, ju&s;t and hone&s;t, true and faithful. But &s;till Charity in all this would have got but a little Way. It not only <HI>does ju&s;tly,</HI> but moreover, it <HI>loves Mercy:</HI> it delights in every Thing that is tender and friendly, kind and obliging, compa&s;&s;ionate and merciful; and is ready to every good Office, whereby we may ren|der our&s;elves either amiable or u&s;eful to our Brethren, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are in Nece&s;&s;ity or Di&s;tre&s;s, and in every Thing that promotes the public Peace and Weal, and the Glory of God. Such are the ble&s;&s;ed Fruits of Charity; for it looks on every One with a Brother's Eye, as &s;tanding in a very near and tender Relation, as having all one heavenly Father, one ble&s;|&s;ed Redeemer, and one holy Sanctifier. Hence Cha|rity ri&s;es higher and embraceth the whole Family in Heaven and Earth, and from the Children it ri&s;es yet higher and higher, and loves and delights in the great Father and Lord of all Things, as our chief and &s;overeign Good, above every Thing in the World be&s;ide, who&s;e Intere&s;t is one and the &s;ame with that of all his Creatures, &s;aying, <HI>Whom is there in Heaven but Thee, and there is nothing on Earth that I de&s;ire in Compari&s;on
<PB N="19" REF="010938_0019_0F852B9F2FF279A0">
of Thee.</HI> Thus Charity ri&s;eth from Earth to Heaven, from the Creature to the Creator, and devotes it&s;elf intirely to Him, who is all in all! And when it hath engaged us to be thus devoted without Re&s;erve to him, we at once fall pro&s;trate before him, and make it the grand Care and Bu&s;ine&s;s of our Lives to <HI>walk humbly with our God,</HI> in a lowly Sen&s;e of our intire Dependence upon Him for all our Enjoyments, and all our Hopes; which will engage us to do all our Duties both towards God and Man, from a Sen&s;e of Duty to Him, and a &s;olicitous Concern to &s;erve and plea&s;e him in all that we do.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee the va&s;t Extent and Influence of this noble Principle of <HI>Charity,</HI> which St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us in my Text, is the End of the Commandment; the End of the whole Sy&s;tem of Chri&s;tianity, for <HI>Love,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>is the fulfilling of the Law;</HI> this <HI>Law of Grace.</HI> For this End, that we may be thus devoted to the Love of God and Man; this divine Religion teach|eth us, both our &s;ingle and joint entire Dependence upon him our common heavenly Parent, and our Accountablene&s;s to him for all our Behaviour, <HI>who &s;earcheth the Hearts, and trieth the Reins of the Children of Men.</HI> For this End it teacheth us a mo&s;t wonder|ful and my&s;terious Scene of Love in the Conde&s;cen|&s;ion of the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> to die a bitter Death that we might live forever; <HI>to be made Sin for us, who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him:</HI> and <HI>when he was rich, to become poor, that we thro' his Poverty might be made rich.</HI> And for this End it requireth us to rely on the heavenly A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the holy Spirit; the Spirit of Love and Peace, (who&s;e Aid it promi&s;eth to our &s;incere Prayers and Endeavours) to in&s;pire us with this divine Principle, that we may
<PB N="20" REF="010938_0020_0F852B9FD45E1898">
<HI>be followers of God as dear Children, and walk in Love, as Chri&s;t al&s;o hath loved us and given him&s;elf for us;</HI> and <HI>forgive one another as God for Chri&s;t's Sake forgiv|eth us.</HI> For this End are we by our Bapti&s;m admitted into the Family of God, which is the Family of Love, and made his Children by Adoption and Grace, and thereby obliged to con&s;ider all Chri&s;tians as our Bre|thern and Si&s;ters, and to treat them accordingly, to be pitiful and courteous, kind and obliging in all our Deportment one towards another; to avoid all har&s;h Con&s;tructions, and to put the kinde&s;t Con&s;tructions we can upon what every One &s;ays and does. And for this End are we required once every Week to join together in the &s;ame public Wor&s;hip, in paying our common Homage and Adoration as Children to our one common heavenly Father, <HI>lifting up holy Hands, without Wrath &amp; doubting,</HI> and to delight in his Wor&s;hip &amp; Service: and as often as may be, to partake together at his holy Table, the common heavenly Banquet; the holy Fea&s;t of Love, where we have &s;et before us a lively Repre&s;entation of the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing In&s;tance of Love that ever the Sun beheld, in the Death of Chri&s;t, who &s;pilt his precious Blood alike for us all; than which &s;urely nothing can be imagined more ef|fectual to unite us to God, and to knit our Hearts together in the holy Bands of univer&s;al Love and Cha|rity. Thus you &s;ee how every Thing in Chri&s;tianity drives at this &s;ingle Point! So that it abundantly ap|pears, that <HI>the End of the Commandment is indeed Cha|rity;</HI> and that, <HI>out of a pure Heart, and a good Con&s;ci|ence and Faith unfeigned.</HI></P>
<P>It is Charity out of a <HI>pure Heart.</HI> From whence it is plain, that Charity mu&s;t be &s;eated and rooted in the Heart, for it is <HI>out of the Abundance of the Heart that
<PB N="21" REF="010938_0021_0F852BA0622A98E8">
the Mouth &s;peaketh,</HI> and the Hands act. The <HI>Heart</HI> is the Fountain, by which is meant, according to the Nature of Scripture Language, a Principle of Since|rity and Integrity, or an entire well-meaning, that aims at nothing but Truth and Right, and abhors all Di&s;gui&s;e and double Dealing, and di&s;dains all Deceit and Hypocri&s;y. <HI>My Son, give me thy Heart,</HI> is the Command of God to every One of us; for <HI>as a Man thinketh in his Heart, &s;o is he:</HI> i. e. he is good or bad according to the real Intention and Di&s;po&s;ition of his Heart. Charity therefore is not to be e&s;timated by ever &s;o devout an Appearance, or &s;o courteous a Car|riage or fair Profe&s;&s;ions; it con&s;i&s;teth <HI>not in Word and in Tongue only, but in Deed and in Truth:</HI> It mu&s;t proceed out of a <HI>pure Heart,</HI> if it would be genuine; i. e. a Heart that is pure and free from any corrupt Mixture of In&s;incerity or Ill-will. But this Phra&s;e, a <HI>pure Heart,</HI> does al&s;o imply a Heart free from all im|pure, uncha&s;te or debauched Tempers or ba&s;e Lu&s;ts. True Charity is a holy Principle that abhors all <HI>Fil|thine&s;s and &s;uperfluity of Naughtine&s;s.</HI> So that if we love our Neighbour ever &s;o heartily, yet if at the &s;ame Time we aim at gratifying any ba&s;e Lu&s;t, or &s;uffer any &s;inful Di&s;po&s;ition or De&s;ign to harbour in our Brea&s;t, this will utterly de&s;troy it, as being incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the very Nature of it. Would we then be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this holy Principle, we mu&s;t <HI>clean&s;e our &s;elves from all Filthine&s;s</HI> both <HI>of Fle&s;h and Spirit, per|fecting Holine&s;s in the Fear of God,</HI> and beg of God to <HI>create in us clean Hearts and renew in us right Spirits,</HI> that <HI>out of the Abundance of the Heart,</HI> devoted to God, and all that is good, our <HI>Months may &s;peak,</HI> and our Hands act upon all Occa&s;ions &s;uch Things as are good, and well plea&s;ing in the Sight both of God and Man.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="010938_0022_0F852BA135871C18">For then would Charity al&s;o proceed from a <HI>good Con&s;cience;</HI> i. e. a Con&s;cience that is well in&s;tructed in the Knowledge of our Duty upon all Occa&s;ions, and in all its Branches, and has a &s;erious and con&s;cientious Concern to do it. This is the Account St. <HI>Paul</HI> gives of his own Conduct, which &s;peaks him to be &s;o|licitous above all Things, as we &s;hould all be, <HI>to think and do always &s;uch Things as be rightful.</HI> And <HI>herein,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>do I exerci&s;e my&s;elf to have always a Con&s;cience void of Offence, both towards God and towards Men.</HI> And <HI>this is our Rejoicing,</HI> &s;ays he again, <HI>the Te&s;timony of our Con&s;ci|ences, that in Simplicity, and godly Sincerity, not by fle&s;hly Wi&s;dom, but by the Grace of God, we have our Conver&s;a|tion in the World:</HI> than which Words, none can be de|vi&s;ed more appo&s;ite to expre&s;s what he here means by &s;uch a good Con&s;cience as mu&s;t be the Foundation on which true Charity is built, and the Root from which alone it can &s;pring. Vain therefore are all the Preten|ces to Charity, unle&s;s we <HI>live in all good Con&s;cience</HI> in the whole of our Conduct, unle&s;s we &s;tudy &s;incerely to know it in all its Branches and Exertions, and the Rules by which it mu&s;t be regulated; and unle&s;s we hone&s;tly and diligently endeavour to frame the Temper of our Hearts, and the Conduct of our whole Lives, as exactly conformable to them, as ever we can.</P>
<P>For la&s;tly this true Charity whereof the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, mu&s;t al&s;o &s;pring from a Principle of <HI>Faith un|feigned,</HI> which is nearly connected with <HI>a pure Heart,</HI> and a <HI>good Con&s;cience;</HI> for it is <HI>Faith</HI> which <HI>purifies the Heart and works by Love;</HI> the Principles of which, are of &s;o pure and heavenly a Nature, as to be utterly in|con&s;i&s;tent with all Impurity and In&s;incerity; and there|fore if they be unfeignedly believed and embraced, they will not fail to bani&s;h every filthy, polluted and
<PB N="23" REF="010938_0023_0F852BA1ECAA95E8">
ill-de&s;igning Imagination out of the Heart, and then the pure Love both of God and Man will of Cour&s;e take Place. Moreover, the&s;e divine Principles of our mo&s;t holy Faith are the Foundations of all tho&s;e Rules of Action with which a good Con&s;cience is informed, and the great Motives by which it is governed, in all the Exertions of Charity; &s;o that where our <HI>Faith</HI> or Belief of the Principles of Chri&s;tianity is unfeigned, it cannot fail but true Charity will a&s;&s;uredly obtain; every Principle of Chri&s;tian Belief, implying in it a Rule or a Motive to Charity. Let us then unfeignedly and without any Doubt or He&s;itation, and from the very Bottom of our Hearts, believe every Doctrine or In&s;truction which our ble&s;&s;ed Lord hath taught us; for it will ever be found that our Charity will ri&s;e or &s;ub|&s;ide, improve or abate, in exact Proportion to the Sin|cerity of our Faith. But let it be al&s;o remember'd, that Faith many Times &s;ignifies an unfeigned Per&s;ua&s;ion, concerning the Lawfulne&s;s and Goodne&s;s of our Acti|ons, as well as the Truth of our Principles. This there|fore mu&s;t make us always wary and con&s;iderate, and careful that we be never warped or bia&s;&s;ed by any Pre|judice or Partiality. And la&s;tly, as true &s;aving <HI>Faith</HI> does always imply in it a practical Faithfulne&s;s to God and Chri&s;t, and to one another, in all our Deportment, it mu&s;t therefore ever be our Re&s;olution in all the Ex|ertions of Charity to act the truly faithful, hone&s;t, and upright Part, that &s;o neither our Faith nor Charity may ever be reproved.</P>
<P>Thus I have explained to you the amiable Nature and genuine Principles of true Chri&s;tian Charity, and &s;hewn you how this is the <HI>End of the Commandment,</HI> &amp; the Perfection of Chri&s;tianity. Let it therefore be the great Concern of our Lives to prove our&s;elves Chri&s;|tians
<PB N="24" REF="010938_0024_0F852BA29FF79030">
indeed, by abounding in all the Fruits of <HI>Charity, out of a pure Heart a good Con&s;cience and Faith unfeigned;</HI> for this is the ble&s;&s;ed Di&s;po&s;ition that will in the Na|ture of it directly qualify us for Heaven, and make us <HI>meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light,</HI> where nothing but Truth and Charity will for ever prevail. For <HI>now abideth Faith, Hope, and Charity, the&s;e Three, but the greate&s;t of the&s;e is Charity;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Charity never faileth,</HI> but will &s;till remain beyond the Grave, our Duty and Delight, our Perfection and Hap|pine&s;s as long as Eternity it&s;elf &s;hall endure! In Or|der to which, let us continually mortify and guard our+&s;elves again&s;t all tho&s;e ba&s;e Lu&s;ts and untoward Tem|pers which are &s;o contrary to Charity, that this divine Principle may ever reign and prevail in our Hearts &amp; govern our Lives. And to our Endeavours, let us add our daily and earne&s;t Prayers (in the Words of our ex|cellent Church) to that <HI>God who hath taught us that all our Doings without Charity are nothing worth, that he would &s;end his Holy Gho&s;t, and pour into our Hearts this mo&s;t excellent Gift of Charity, the very Bond of Peace and of all Virtues, without which, who&s;oever liveth is counted dead before him; that being dead unto Sin, we may be alive unto God, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord;</HI> and &s;o be quali|fied for that ble&s;&s;ed World before us, where God and Truth and Charity &s;hall forever reign: Which God our heavenly Father, of his infinite Mercy grant, thro' his free Grace and the Merits and Interce&s;&s;ion of his ble&s;&s;ed Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and by the gracious and re|newing Influences of his holy Spirit. To which one eternal God, in Three Per&s;ons, be a&s;cribed, as is mo&s;t due, all Honor and Glory, Dominion and Power, World without End. AMEN.</P>
