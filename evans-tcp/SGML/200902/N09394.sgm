<Q><P>AS a faithful and accurate hi&s;tory of di&s;ea&s;es, their various &s;ymptoms and method of cure, is the mo&s;t effectual way of promoting the art of healing; Phy&s;icians &s;hould de&s;cribe, with the utmo&s;t care, the di&s;ea&s;es they would treat of; and the good and bad effects of any method or medicines they have u&s;ed in them. But in a more particular manner is this nece&s;&s;ary, when any new and uncommon di&s;temper occurs, of which the peculiar pathognomonic and diagno&s;tic &s;igns &s;hould be carefully laid down, and a particular account given of what evacuations, regimen, and medicines were u&s;eful or hurtful in it.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FROM a conviction of the truth and importance of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, and in obedience to the precept of &s;o great a Man as Huxham, I have determined to attempt the hi&s;tory of a di&s;ea&s;e, which has lately appeared among the children of this city; and which, both as an uncommon and highly dangerous di&s;temper, well de&s;erves an attentive con&s;ideration. In delivering it therefore, I &s;hall fir&s;t carefully enumerate the &s;ymptoms with which it was attended, and de&s;cribe the appearances
<PB N="6" REF="011977_0005_0FB8726E8F071F48">
which occurred on in&s;pecting the bodies of &s;uch as died of it; then enquire into its nature and cau&s;e; and la&s;tly lay down the method of cure which has been found to be mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in its treatment.</P>
<P>IN general, this di&s;ea&s;e was confined to children under ten years old, though &s;ome few grown per&s;ons, particularly women, (while it prevailed) had &s;ymptoms in &s;ome re&s;pects re&s;embling it. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e who had it were ob&s;erved to droop for &s;everal days before they were confined. And the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, were a &s;lighty inflamed and watry eye, a bloated and livid countenance, with a few red eruptions here and there upon the face, and in one ca&s;e a &s;mall ulcer in the no&s;e, whence oo&s;ed an ichor &s;o &s;harp as to inflame and erode the upper lip. At the &s;ame time, or very &s;oon after, &s;uch as could &s;peak, complained of an unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation in the throat, but without any great &s;orene&s;s or pain. Upon examining it, the ton&s;ils <HI>or almonds,</HI> appeared &s;welled and &s;lightly inflamed, with a few white &s;pecks upon them, which, in &s;ome, increa&s;ed &s;o as to cover them all over with one general &s;lough, and in a few the &s;welling was &s;o great, as almo&s;t to clo&s;e up the pa&s;&s;age of the throat; but this, altho' a frequent &s;ymptom, did not invariably attend the di&s;ea&s;e; and &s;ome had all the other &s;ymptoms without it. The breath was either no ways offen|&s;ive, or had only that kind of &s;mell which is occa&s;ioned by worms; and the &s;wallowing was very little, it at all, impeded.</P>
<P>THESE &s;ymptoms, with a &s;light fever at night, continued in &s;ome for five or &s;ix days, without alarming their friends; in others a difficulty
<PB N="7" REF="011977_0006_0FB87270414E32B0">
of breathing came on within twenty-four hours, e&s;pecially in the time of &s;leep, and was often &s;uddenly encrea&s;ed to &s;o great a degree as to threaten immediate &s;uffocation. In general, however, it came on later, increa&s;ed more gradually, and was not con&s;tant; but the patient would now and then enjoy an interval of an hour or two, in which he breathed with ea&s;e, and then again a laborious breathing would en&s;ue, during which he &s;eemed incapable of filling his lungs, as if the air was drawn through a too narrow pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>THIS &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e was attended with a very great and &s;udden pro&s;tration of &s;trength; a very remarkable hollow dry cough; and a peculiar change in the tone of the voice; not ea&s;ily de&s;cribed, but &s;o &s;ingular, that a per&s;on who had once heard it, could almo&s;t certainly know the di&s;ea&s;e again by hearing the patient cough or &s;peak. In &s;ome the voice was almo&s;t entirely lo&s;t, and would continue very weak and low for &s;everal weeks after recovery. A con&s;tant fever attended this di&s;ea&s;e, but it was much more remarkable in the night than in the day time; and in &s;ome there was a remarkable remi&s;&s;ion towards morning. The pul&s;e at the wri&s;t was in general quick, &s;oft and fluttering, though not very low, and it was re|markable, that at the &s;ame time the pul&s;ations of the heart were rather &s;trong and &s;mart than feeble. The heat was not very great, and the &s;kin was commonly moi&s;t.</P>
<P>THESE &s;ymptoms continued for one, two, or three days. By that time it was u&s;ual for them to be greatly increa&s;ed in &s;uch as died; and the patients, though commonly &s;omewhat comatous
<PB N="8" REF="011977_0007_0FB87272625E3F90">
from the beginning, now became much more &s;o; yet even when the di&s;order was at the wor&s;t, they retained their &s;en&s;es, and would give di&s;tinct an&s;wers, when &s;poken to; although on being left to them|&s;elves, they lay for the mo&s;t part in a lethargic &s;ituation, only rai&s;ing up now and then to receive their drink. Great re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and jactation came on towards the end of the di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;ick perpetually to&s;&s;ing from one &s;ide of the bed to the other, but they were &s;till &s;o far comatous as to appear to be a&s;leep, immediately upon changing their &s;ituation or po&s;ture. An univer&s;al languor and dejection were ob&s;erved in their countenances; the &s;welling of the face &s;ub&s;ided; a profu&s;e &s;weat broke out about the head, neck and brea&s;t, particularly when a&s;leep; a purging in &s;everal came on; the difficul|ty of breathing increa&s;ed, &s;o as to be frequently almo&s;t entirely ob&s;tructed, and the patient died apparently from the &s;uffocation. This commonly happened before the end of the fourth or fifth day; in &s;everal within thirty-&s;ix hours from the time the difficulty of breathing fir&s;t came on. One child, however, lived under the&s;e circum&s;tances to the eighth day; and the day before he died, his breath and what he coughed up, was &s;omewhat offen&s;ive; but this was the only in&s;tance in which I could di&s;cover any thing like a di&s;agreable &s;mell, either from the breath or expectoration.</P>
<P>OUT of &s;ixteen ca&s;es attended with this remark|able &s;uffocation in breathing, &s;even died; five of them before the fifth day, the other two about the eighth. Of tho&s;e who recovered, the di&s;ea&s;e was carried off, in one, by a plentiful &s;alivation, which began on the &s;ixth day; in mo&s;t of the others, by an expectoration of a vi&s;cid mucus.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="011977_0008_0FB87273CCC1AFA0">I DISTINGUISH between the &s;alivation and ex|pectoration, becau&s;e in one the di&s;charge &s;eemed to come from the &s;alivary glands, and was attended with little or no cough; in the others it manife&s;tly came from the Trachea, and was attended with an ince&s;&s;ant cough; and I judged the &s;alivation to have been a natural cri&s;is, as the patient had taken but &s;ix grains of calomel before it came on. Her gums were not inflamed, her teeth were not loo&s;e, nor had her breath or &s;aliva, the &s;mell of per&s;ons under a mercurial &s;alivation. In this ca&s;e the voice, in the &s;pace of a few hours, from being pretty &s;trong and loud, became &s;o low as to be with difficulty heard.</P>
<P>ONE of the fir&s;t families in which this di&s;ea&s;e appeared was that of Mr. W. W. of this place. He had &s;even children in his family, all of whom were taken ill one after another. The four fir&s;t had the di&s;ea&s;e as I have ju&s;t now de&s;cribed, and three of the&s;e died; the one who recovered was the in&s;tance I mentioned, in which the di&s;ea&s;e was carried off by a &s;alivation. The other three were the younge&s;t. They had not the difficulty of breathing, but in its &s;tead, very troubl&s;ome ulcers behind their ears. The&s;e began with a few red pimples, which &s;oon ran together, itched violently, and di&s;charged a great deal of a very &s;harp ichor, &s;o as to erode the neighbouring parts, and in a few days &s;pread all over the back part of the ear, and down upon the neck. They all had a fever, particularly at night, and one of them had a perpetual tene&s;mus, <HI>(or urging to go to &s;tool.)</HI> This &s;ymptom appeared in &s;ome who had the difficulty of breathing, but in none to &s;o remarkable a degree as in this child.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="011977_0009_0FB872754431F1B0">AFTER this, many other children had &s;imilar ulcers behind their ears, and &s;ome of them &s;eemed &s;lightly affected with the difficulty of breathing, but it never became alarming while this di&s;charge continued. The&s;e ulcers would continue for &s;everal weeks, appeared covered in &s;ome places with &s;loughs, re&s;embling tho&s;e on the ton&s;ils; and at la&s;t grew very painful and unea&s;y.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome ca&s;es they were attended with &s;wellings of the glands under the tongue and behind the ears, which &s;ub&s;ided on the eruptions appearing, and di&s;charging freely, and again &s;welled upon the di&s;charge being checked.</P>
<P>I MET with nothing like this complaint in adult per&s;ons, unle&s;s the two following ca&s;es may be con|&s;idered as allied to it; they happened about the &s;ame time, and both were women; one of them had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in laying out two of the children that died of it. At fir&s;t her &s;ymptoms re&s;embled rather an inflammatory angina, but about the third day the ton&s;ils appeared covered with thick &s;loughs, her pul&s;e was low and feeble; &s;he had a moi&s;t Skin, a dejection of &s;pirits, and &s;ome degree of anxiety; though nothing like the difficult breathing of the children.</P>
<P>THE other was a &s;oldier's wife, who for &s;ome time before &s;he perceived any complaint in her throat, laboured under a low fever. Her ton&s;ils were &s;welled, and entirely covered with &s;loughs, re&s;embling tho&s;e of the children; but her breath was more offen&s;ive, and &s;he had no &s;uffocation.</P>
<P>I HAVE had an opportunity of examining the nature and &s;eat of this di&s;ea&s;e, from di&s;&s;ection, in
<PB N="11" REF="011977_0010_0FB872779431A1C8">
three in&s;tances. One was a child of three years old. Her fir&s;t complaint was an unea&s;ine&s;s in her throat. Upon examining it, the ton&s;ils appeared &s;welled and inflamed, with large white &s;loughs upon them, the edges of which were remarkably more red than the other parts of the throat. She had no great &s;orene&s;s in her throat, and could &s;wallow with little or no difficulty. She complained of a pain under her left brea&s;t; her pul&s;e was quick, &s;oft and fluttering. The heat of her body was not very great, and her &s;kin was moi&s;t; her face was &s;welled, &s;he had a con&s;iderable pro&s;tration of &s;trength, with a very great difficulty of breathing, a very remarkable hollow cough, and a peculiar change in the the tone of her voice. The next day her difficulty of breathing was in|crea&s;ed, and &s;he drew her breath in the manner before de&s;cribed, as if the air was forced through too narrow a pa&s;&s;age, &s;o that &s;he &s;eemed incapable of filling her lungs: She was exceedingly re&s;tle&s;s, to&s;&s;ing perpetually from &s;ide to &s;ide, was &s;en&s;ible, and when a&s;ked a que&s;tion, would give a pertinent an&s;wer, but otherways &s;he appeared dull and comatous. All the&s;e &s;ymptoms continued, or rather increa&s;ed, until the third night, on which &s;he had five or &s;ix loo&s;e &s;tools, and died early in the morn|ing.</P>
<P>UPON examining the body, which was done on the afternoon of the day &s;he died, all the back parts of the throat, and the root of the tongue were found inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;loughs, which &s;till retained their whiti&s;h colour. Upon removing them, the parts underneath appeared rather pale than in|flamed. No putrid &s;mell could be perceived from them, nor was the corps in the lea&s;t offen&s;ive.
<PB N="12" REF="011977_0011_0FB872791B8D2578">
The Oe&s;ophagus, <HI>or gullet,</HI> appeared as in a found &s;tate. The epiglottis, <HI>which covers the wind-pipe,</HI> was a little inflamed, on its external &s;urface, and on the inner &s;ide, together with the whole larynx, was covered with the &s;ame tough white &s;loughs, as the glands of the throat. The whole trachea quite down to its divi&s;ion in the lungs, was lined with an in&s;pi&s;&s;ated mucus, in form of a membrane, remarkably tough and firm; which, when it came into the lungs, &s;eemed to grow thin and di&s;appear: It was &s;o tough as to require no incon&s;iderable force to tear it, and came out whole from the trachea, which it left with much ea&s;e; and re&s;embled more than any thing, both in thickne&s;s and appear|ance, a &s;heath of thin &s;hammoy leather. The inner membrane of the trachea was &s;lightly inflamed; the lungs too appeared inflamed, as in peripneumo|nic ca&s;es; particularly the right lobe, on which there were many large livid &s;pots, though neither rotten or offen&s;ive; and the left lobe had &s;mall black &s;pots on it, re&s;embling tho&s;e marks left under the &s;kin by gun powder. Upon cutting into any of the larger &s;pots, which appeared on the right lobe, a bloody &s;anies i&s;&s;ued from them without frothing, whereas upon cutting tho&s;e parts which appeared &s;ound, a whiti&s;h froth, but &s;lightly tinged with blood, followed the knife.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd di&s;&s;ection I attended, was of a child about &s;even years old, who had had all the &s;ymptoms with which this di&s;ea&s;e is commonly attended, except that in this ca&s;e the glands of the throat, and upper parts of the wind pipe, were found entirely free from any complaint, and the di&s;ea&s;e &s;eemed to be confined to the trachea only, which was lined with this tough mucus,
<PB N="13" REF="011977_0012_0FB8727AA27A37B8">
in&s;pi&s;&s;ated &s;o as to re&s;emble a membrane: We could trace it into the larger divi&s;ions of the trachea, and it was evident that the &s;malle&s;t branches were ob&s;tructed by it, for it was very ob&s;ervable, that upon opening the brea&s;t the lungs did not colap&s;e as much as is u&s;ual, but remained di&s;tended, and felt remarkably firm and heavy, as if they were &s;tuffed with the &s;ame mucus.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t was a child of about three years old, who died in thirty-&s;ix hours after the difficult breathing fir&s;t came on; yet even in this ca&s;e, I di&s;covered and &s;hewed to &s;everal by-&s;tanders, the in&s;pi&s;&s;ated mucus which lined the trachea, and which was &s;o remarkable as to be evident to all who &s;aw it, that it mu&s;t have been the cau&s;e of the child's death.</P>
<P>THIS is a faithful hi&s;tory of this complaint, as it appeard in mo&s;t of the ca&s;es I have met with; and in which I have been careful to enumerate &s;uch &s;ymptoms only, as I my&s;elf have &s;een. In the next place, let us compare it with &s;ome &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;es de&s;cribed by others, with a view to di&s;cover what connection there is between them, and to &s;ee if this compari&s;on will throw any light upon its diagno&s;tic &s;igns, its nature, or cure.</P>
<P>DOCTOR HOME, in an e&s;&s;ay publi&s;hed &s;ome years ago at Edinburgh, de&s;cribes a di&s;ea&s;e under the name of the Croup, or Suffocatio Stridula, attended with the following &s;ymptoms:&mdash;It was peculiar to children, attended with a &s;ingular change in the tone of the voice, which he re&s;embles to the crowing of a cock, but acknowledges it is not ea&s;ily de&s;cribed; a quick and laborious
<PB N="14" REF="011977_0013_0FB8727CCB6A6CA0">
breathing, without much difficulty in &s;wallowing, or remarkable inflammation in the throat, a dull pain about the upper part of the wind-pipe, and &s;ometimes a cough, but not of the common kind, but more &s;hort and &s;tiffled, and le&s;s con|vul&s;ive, with little or no expectoration. He adds, that the children pre&s;erved their &s;en&s;es to the la&s;t, and were remarkably free from all other complaints, &s;o that they would eat a minute before they expired, that they commonly drooped &s;ome days before they were confined, and that in many the face was &s;welled and bloated.</P>
<P>SUCH a remarkable agreement in the &s;ymptoms, is of it&s;elf almo&s;t &s;ufficient to determine the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es to be the &s;ame, but when we compare the appearances from di&s;&s;ection, it is placed beyond a doubt. In eight ca&s;es of which he gives the di&s;&s;ection, the mucous membrane I have de&s;cribed, was con&s;tantly found, and put on exactly the &s;ame appearances; it was of a firm con&s;i&s;tence, loo&s;ely adhering to the trachea, from which it came off in the &s;hape of a hollow tube, and either in that form, or as a tough mucus, de&s;cended into the &s;malle&s;t branches of the trachea, &s;o as to choak their cavities, and con&s;equently &s;uffocate the patient. It is true, Doctor Home does not mention the &s;welling of the ton&s;ils, or the &s;loughs upon them, as frequent &s;ymptoms; but in &s;ome ca&s;es here they were wanting; and he mentions &s;ome, in which the ton&s;ils, together with all the glands about the root of the tongue, were &s;welled, and covered with mucus; &s;o that upon the whole it can hardly be doubted, but that they are the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="011977_0014_0FB8727E4AB47698">DOCTORS FOTHERGILL and HUXHAM, have both written upon a di&s;ea&s;e, under the title of a Malig|nant ulcerous &s;ore throat; which in &s;ome circum|&s;tances, particularly an ery&s;ipelatous eruption, with which it was attended, and many &s;ymptoms which indicated a high degree of putre&s;cency in the humours, widely differed from the complaint I have de&s;cribed; and yet they agree in &s;o many other, and &s;uch remarkable &s;ymptoms, that I cannot help entertaining an opinion, that they bear &s;ome relation to each other. Do not the&s;e circum&s;tances, their being in a great mea&s;ure peculiar to children, their infectious nature, their beginning with a watry inflamed eye, &s;ucceeded by an inflamation, &s;wellings and &s;loughs on the ton&s;ils and neighbouring parts, unattended with any remarkable difficulty in &s;wallowing; the inflam|mation and di&s;charge from the no&s;e, behind the ear, &amp;c. the fever and poroxi&s;m at night; but above all the peculiar difficulty in breathing, the hoar&s;e dry cough, and remarkable change in the tone of the voice? I &s;ay, do not the&s;e &s;ymptoms, in which they all agree, ju&s;tify &s;uch an opinion, and although the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es may &s;pecifically differ, yet determine them to be generically the &s;ame? And may not the ery&s;ipelatous eruptions, and putrid &s;ymptoms mentioned by the&s;e gentlemen, have belonged rather to the con&s;titution of the air, than to the e&s;&s;ential nature of the di&s;ea&s;e; ju&s;t as the &s;mall pox, according to accidental circum|&s;tances, puts on a mild or a malignant appearance. There &s;eems great rea&s;on to believe this was the ca&s;e, e&s;pecially in that di&s;ea&s;e de&s;cribed by Doctor Huxham, for he particularly mentions that all the di&s;ea&s;es of that &s;ea&s;on, were attended with <Q>&s;ome kind of cuticular eruptions, and that too
<PB N="16" REF="011977_0015_0FB87280720442A0">
even in pleuretic and peripneumonic di&s;orders, &s;o greatly did the con&s;titution of the air, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed to produce eruptions in all &s;orts of feveri&s;h indi&s;po&s;itions, and the blood drawn from the di&s;ea&s;ed during all that time was very rarely vi&s;cid, but generally florid, and e&s;pecially at the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e of a very loo&s;e texture.</Q> He particularly mentions too, the &s;trangulated breathing, and hoar&s;e hollow voice as characteri&s;tic &s;ymptoms; and &s;ays, that <Q>this noi&s;e in &s;peaking and breathing was &s;o peculiar, that any per&s;on in the lea&s;t conver&s;ant with the di&s;|ea&s;e might know it by this odd noi&s;e.</Q> And &s;everal Spani&s;h and Italian phy&s;icians, quoted by Doctor Fothergill, as treating of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, on which he writes, not only take notice of this very remarkable &s;ymptom, but even name the di&s;ea&s;e from it, Garotillo &amp; Morbus Strangulato|rius. A &s;trong proof that the &s;uffocation mu&s;t (in the ca&s;es they met with, as it was with tho&s;e I have de&s;cribed) have been the mo&s;t &s;triking &s;ymptom, and that which con&s;tituted the danger of the di&s;ea&s;e. This is &s;till more evident from the rea&s;on given by R. Moreau, why the Spaniards call it Garotillo, <Q>becau&s;e, (&s;ays he,) tho&s;e afflicted with this di&s;|order, appear to be affected in the &s;ame man|ner as &s;uch as are &s;trangled by a rope.</Q> It is likewi&s;e remarkable, that &s;ome of the fir&s;t writers on the complaint of which Doctor Fothergill treats, call it &s;imply <HI>Garotillo, Morbus Strangulatorius, &amp;c.</HI> taking little notice of the &s;ymptoms of putrefaction; while others, as Severinus connect them together, terming it <HI>Pe&s;tilens ac praefocans pueros ab&s;ce&s;&s;us;</HI> and others again entirely omit the &s;ymptoms of &s;uffo|cation, and name it <HI>Angina Pe&s;tilens, Angina Gan|greno&s;a, malignant ulcerous &s;ore throat, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="011977_0016_0FB872815081B540">THE &s;ame difference too is to be remarked with regard to the opinion the fir&s;t writers on it enter|tained of its infectious nature; for whil&s;t many declare it to be pe&s;tilential and contagious without re&s;triction, &s;ome, particularly Corte&s;ius, an Italian phy&s;ician con&s;ider it as contagious, only in a cer|tain limitted &s;en&s;e; <HI>"non e&s;&s;e ab&s;que aliqua conta|gione,"</HI> are his words.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Fothergill's Account of the &s;ore Throat.</NOTE> So that it &s;eems very evi|dent, that even the di&s;ea&s;e which Doctor Fothergill treats of, was frequently connected with tho&s;e affections of the trachea, and that every remark|able &s;uffocation and &s;trangulation in breathing, which &s;o &s;trongly characteri&s;e that, we have lately had among us; and on the other hand that the &s;ymptoms of putrefaction greatly differed at different times, and in different places in that on which he writes: Nor is it improbable to &s;uppo&s;e, that where the &s;ymp|toms of putrefaction mo&s;t prevailed, there the &s;uffocation would be lea&s;t evident; as it would naturally prevent the formation of that mucous membrane, which occa&s;ions the &s;uffocation.</P>
<P>NEITHER Doctors Fothergill nor Huxham, have favoured us with any di&s;&s;ections of per&s;ons who died of the complaints they treat of; but Huxham ob&s;erves that pieces of the internal membrane of the wind-pipe were &s;ometimes &s;pit up, which pro|bably were nothing but the in&s;pi&s;&s;ated mucus I have mentioned, from its very near re&s;emblance to it, mi&s;taken for the membrane of the trachea. And Doctor Monro, &s;en. in the di&s;&s;ection of &s;ome children who died at Edinburgh, of a di&s;ea&s;e then con&s;idered to be the putrid &s;ore throat, found the &s;ame mucus membrane lining the trachea, and de|&s;cending
<PB N="18" REF="011977_0017_0FB87282C6040A00">
into its minute&s;t branches, &s;imilar to what is found in the croup: It was not, however, univer&s;al in all he examined, but wherever it was found, it was remarkable that the children, whil&s;t alive, breathed in the &s;ame manner, through|out the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, as tho&s;e who were affected with the croup; a pretty evident proof, that the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are at lea&s;t allied to, and apt to run into each other. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Doctor Withering's The&s;is on the Angina Gangreno&s;a.</NOTE></P>
<P>MAY not therefore, the great di&s;charge of mucus from the trachea and fauces, mentioned by Dr. Fothergill and Huxham, have ari&s;en from the &s;ame &s;ource, only that from the greater acrimony and putre&s;cency in that &s;pecies of the di&s;ea&s;e it put on a thinner con&s;i&s;tence? Or is it improbable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;ymptoms of putrefaction, mentioned by the&s;e gentlemen, have rather been accidental, and ari&s;en from the peculiar con&s;titution of the air at that time, or from &s;ome other occa&s;ional circum&s;tance, than of the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, and e&s;&s;ential to it. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am inclined to be of this opinion, particularly as I find from all accounts, that the difficulty in breathing, and &s;ymptoms of &s;uffocation almo&s;t invariably attended this complaint; and that tho&s;e of putrefaction differed greatly at different times, and in different patients. There is one ca&s;e in particular mentioned by Doctor Fothergill, of a girl about twelve years old, who died in twenty-four hours from the attack of the di&s;ea&s;e, evidently from the &s;trangulation, and not from a putrid di&s;&s;olution of the humours; and on the other hand, I have been a&s;&s;ured by &s;ome of the olde&s;t practiitoners in this place, that they
<PB N="19" REF="011977_0018_0FB872851691E888">
have &s;een but a few years ago the di&s;ea&s;e I have de&s;cribed, attended both with ery&s;ipelatous appear|ances and highly putrid &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>UPON the whole therefore I am led to conclude, that the di&s;ea&s;e called by the Italians Morbus Strangulatorius, the croup of Doctor Home, the &s;ore throat of Huxam and Fothergill, this di&s;ea&s;e, and that di&s;cribed by Doctor Dougla&s;s of Bo&s;ton, however they may differ in the &s;ymptoms of putre&s;cency and malignancy, do all bear an e&s;&s;en|tial affinity and relation to each other, are apt to run into one another, and in fact, ari&s;e from the &s;ame Leven, which, as Doctor Fothergill &s;tiles it, is a <HI>Stimulous of a peculiar nature,</HI> which more or le&s;s, according to particular circum&s;tances, generates an acrimony in the humours, and di&s;po&s;es them to putrefaction; and which has a &s;ingular tendency to attack the throat and trachea, affecting the mucous glands of the&s;e parts, in &s;uch a way, as to occa&s;ion them to &s;ecrete their natural mucus, in greater quantities than is &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es of nature; and which in this particular &s;pecies, when &s;ecreted, is either really of a tougher or more vi&s;cid con&s;i&s;tence than natural, or is di&s;po&s;ed to become &s;o from re&s;t and &s;tagnation.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;e I have de&s;cribed, appeared evidently to be of an infectious nature, all infection mu&s;t be owing to &s;omething received into the body, this therefore whatever it is, being drawn in by the breath of a healthy child, irritates the glands of the fauces and trachea as it pa&s;&s;es by them, and brings about a change in their &s;ecretions. The infection, however, did not &s;eem in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e to depend &s;o much on any prevailing di&s;po&s;i|tion
<PB N="20" REF="011977_0019_0FB872868E5E6FB0">
of the air, as upon effluvia received from the breath of infected per&s;ons. This will account why the di&s;order &s;hould go through a whole family, and not affect the next door neighbour; and hence we learn a very u&s;eful le&s;&s;on, namely to remove all the young children in a family, as &s;oon as any one is taken with the di&s;ea&s;e; by which caution I am convinced, many lives have been, and may again be pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>I SHALL now proceed to deliver the method of cure, which was found mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in this di&s;|ea&s;e, as far as it fell under my own ob&s;ervation. And in the fir&s;t place, as from all the &s;ymptoms related, it is evident, that this di&s;order is not always and in every &s;tage, attended with any remarkable degree of putre&s;cency; and from the di&s;&s;ections it appears, that an inflammation of the lungs, if not the cau&s;e, may at lea&s;t be the con&s;equence of the di&s;temper, one would imagine that bleeding and evacuations were not totally to be forbid; and accordingly we find Dr. Dougla&s;s directing us, that if the fever is high, and the patient is plethoric, or accu&s;tomed to bleeding, to take away &s;ome blood, but with di&s;cretion: and if the ton&s;ils are much inflamed, with great pain and diffiulty in &s;wallowing, to open the jugular veins. And Huxham acknowledges, in the ulcerous &s;ore throats of which he treats, <Q>That there were certainly &s;ome of them with a pretty &s;mart fever, that bore bleeding at the beginning with advan|tage, and that he was obliged in &s;everal to give nitre with diaphoretics.</Q></P>
<P>BUT Doctor Fothergill, &s;peaking of the &s;ore throat di&s;temper, which came under his notice,
<PB N="21" REF="011977_0020_0FB87289CBCE8D70">
and which &s;eems to have been of a more highly putrid kind, a&s;&s;ures us; that although in &s;uch ca&s;es he has been induced to order bleeding, yet it did not appear to have any advantageous effects; and concludes, that notwith&s;tanding the vehemence of the &s;ymptoms, it is proper in general to omit this evacuation; nor can I hear of any per&s;on who has u&s;ed it, in the di&s;temper which appeared lately among&s;t us, with &s;ucce&s;s, or any remarkable benefit; &s;o that I hardly dare venture to pre&s;cribe it, but mu&s;t leave it to the di&s;cretion of the Phy&s;ician, until farther experience &s;hall confirm its utility, or forbid its u&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;omething very &s;ingular in the tendency of the virus in this di&s;ea&s;e, as I have already hinted, to attack the throat and trachea, nor are the effects it produces there le&s;s remarkable. Dr. Fothergill, in his account of the putrid &s;ore throat, de&s;cribes the &s;loughs on the ton&s;ils, as mortified e&s;cars; but in the di&s;ea&s;e we have met with, they appeared as in the trachea, to be nothing more than the mucus of the part, preternaturally thickened into the form of a membrane. At fir&s;t I imagined this to be only a peculiar kind of pus, which is &s;ometimes found upon the &s;urface of internal inflamed mem|branes; but upon removing it, the membrane of the trachea did not appear to have been &s;ufficiently inflamed, to ju&s;tify &s;uch an opinion. And in a ca&s;e I lately had an opportunity of examining, where the patient died of a very violent inflamma|tion of the internal membrane of the trachea, there was no &s;uch mucus lining to be di&s;covered upon it. Nor does it appear to be the effect of any &s;pa&s;m or con&s;triction of the lungs, as it is not ge|nerally remarked as occuring in &s;uch as have died
<PB N="22" REF="011977_0021_0FB8728BE75DD1E0">
of &s;pa&s;modic a&s;thmas, in which particular it is not long &s;ince I had an opportunity of being &s;atisfied in the ca&s;e of a &s;ailor, who actually died in a vio|lent fit of a &s;pa&s;modic a&s;thma, which had la&s;ted for &s;everal days; and yet there was not the lea&s;t appearance of any &s;uch mucous membrane after death, either in the large or &s;maller branches of the trachea. This morbid appearance is particul|arly noticed by &s;everal gentlemen who have favoured us with an account of the di&s;&s;ections of tho&s;e who have died under an angina gangreno&s;a, or putrid &s;ore throat. Doctor Monro, &s;en. as I have already taken notice, found it in &s;everal he di&s;&s;ected; and Rolandus Martin Profe&s;&s;or of Anatomy at Stockholm, mentions a very remark|able in&s;tance of it, where this mucous membrane de&s;cended into the minute&s;t branches of the trachea arteria, growing thinner as it de&s;cended deeper into the lungs, until it re&s;embled the membrane which lines the &s;hell of an egg. He adds, that the lungs were not inflamed, nor in the lea&s;t injured, &s;o that the infant died merely from the &s;uffocation. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Doctor Withering's The&s;is on the Angina Gangreno&s;a.</NOTE> And even tho&s;e who have written of the ulcerous &s;ore throat, as Doctors Huxham and Dougla&s;s, and have not given the appearances from di&s;&s;ection, have mentioned many mucous linings being expectorated, which Dougla&s;s compares to the cuticle rai&s;ed by ve&s;ications, and Huxham conceived to be really pieces of the internal membrane of the trachea. So that this is a circum|&s;tance which &s;eems to be peculiar to the di&s;ea&s;e; and which generally does occur in it; and tho&s;e who die, on the &s;econd or third day, with the
<PB N="23" REF="011977_0022_0FB8728FA5A008C8">
&s;trangulated breathing, are probably &s;uffocated by this membrane. This affection, therefore, of the mucous glands, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the proximate cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e, it readily accounts for all the other &s;ymptoms; and from it only, e&s;pecially in the beginning of the complaint, can we &s;afely draw our indications of cure; paying at the &s;ame time a con&s;tant attention to any &s;ymptoms of putre&s;cency that may occur.</P>
<P>IT is from viewing the di&s;ea&s;e in this light only, that we can account for the u&s;e of Mercury in it; a medicine which if we con&s;ider it as a &s;pa&s;modic complaint, cannot po&s;&s;ibly have any good effect, or if we look upon it merely as a putrid di&s;ea&s;e, &s;eems directly contrary to every intention of cure; but which, neverthele&s;s, undoubted experience has proved to be highly beneficial. And indeed, if we con&s;ider the peculiar acrimony which this di&s;|ea&s;e occa&s;ions in the fluids in general, independant of putrefaction, and the in&s;pi&s;&s;ation of the mucus of the trachea, we might rea&s;onably conclude a priore, that Mercury, which in general corrects acrimony, in a very remarkable manner thins all the mucous &s;ecretions, particularly tho&s;e of the mouth and fauces, and affects the breath very early, would be beneficial in it, and either prevent the formation of this membrane, or promote its &s;eparation and expul&s;ion, when already formed. Dr. Dougla&s;s viewing the matter in this light fir&s;t tried it, and meeting with &s;ucce&s;s, afterwards recommended it to others; and, in a very few words, has explained both his theory and practice in this particular. <Q>Any affection of the throat, (&s;ays he) does frequently produce a natural ptya|li&s;m. Mercurials u&s;ed with di&s;cretion, are a
<PB N="24" REF="011977_0023_0FB8729047237FD8">
kind of &s;pecific in &s;uch like ulcers, and ulcu&s;cula, and in fact here moi&s;ten the throat and mouth, &s;top the &s;preading of the ulcu&s;cula, and promote the ca&s;ting off of the &s;loughs; and as an acce&s;|&s;ory advantage, the patients being mo&s;tly children, de&s;troyed worms. Among&s;t all the preparations calomel an&s;wered be&s;t. The gentle vomiting and few &s;tools that it occa&s;ioned in &s;ome, did not con|found the natural cour&s;e of the di&s;temper. Tur|bith produces too &s;trong a revul&s;ion, and the eruption is thereby too much diverted. This di&s;temper did not well bear any other evacuation but mercurials.</Q> And in another place he &s;ays, <Q>the di&s;pumation of this acrid inquination of the juices in our di&s;temper, that is, its natural cri&s;is, &s;eems to be by the patent and &s;alutary emuncto|ries of the fauces and &s;kin. In corro&s;ive taints, u. g. venerial and others, a Mercurial ptyali&s;m, and &s;udorific decoction of the woods an&s;wer be&s;t, this gave us the hint of promoting the tendency of nature in our illne&s;s, by mercurials and gentle breathing &s;weats in bed, which with good management &s;eldom failed, excepting where the necro&s;is was irrimediable from the beginning.</Q></P>
<P>THERE is a &s;ingularity in this Gentleman's &s;tile, but his ob&s;ervations are accurate and judicious; and as he &s;ays him&s;elf, being founded upon real, not imaginary ca&s;es, mu&s;t therefore be of permanent truth. And <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e I met with, in which the di&s;order (and in no trifling degree) was carried off by a very copious &s;alivation, is of it&s;elf, almo&s;t a &s;ufficient vindication of this practice; and together with the ca&s;e of that child who&s;e body I fir&s;t opened, where I &s;aw the mo&s;t powerful anti&s;eptics faithfully admini&s;tered, which not only failed of &s;ucce&s;s, but
<PB N="25" REF="011977_0024_0FB87291D1D72F38">
did not even mitigate the &s;ymptoms, was what fir&s;t led me to enquire more minutely into the nature of this di&s;ea&s;e, and of the remedies which had been u&s;ed with mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s in its cure. Upon reading Dr. Dougla&s;s's little e&s;&s;ay, (which gave me the greater &s;atisfaction becau&s;e he wrote upon the di&s;ea&s;e as it appeared in this country, and under his own immediate ob&s;ervation) I found he placed his chief dependence upon mercurials, which I was the more readily induced to make trial of, from the appearance I found from di&s;&s;ection, the idea I thence naturally formed of this complaint, and the te&s;timonies of &s;ome other Gentlemen in their favour: and indeed the good effects they have been attended with, fully ju&s;tifies the recommenda|tion Dr. Dougla&s;s has given of them; as the more freely I have u&s;ed them, the better effects I have &s;een from them. Calomel is what is commonly recommended, and has been given to the quantity of 30 or 40 grains, or indeed a much larger quantity, in five or &s;ix days, to a child of three or four years old; not only without any ill effects, but to the manife&s;t advantage of the patient; relieving the difficulty of breathing, and promoting the ca&s;ting off of the &s;loughs, beyond any other medicine. That it may the more immediately enter the blood, and act more powerfully as an attenuant, it &s;hould at fir&s;t be joined with a mild opiate; and what is a little remarkable, is, that given in this way, it &s;eldom or never rai&s;ed in children any &s;alivation; though indeed no ill con&s;equences are to be apprehended from it, if it &s;hould. After the fir&s;t or &s;econd do&s;e, the opiate may be omitted, as then the mer|cury will not be &s;o apt to go off by the inte&s;tines, and the opiate if continued will, by le&s;&s;ening the &s;en&s;ibility of the trachea, counteract, in &s;ome
<PB N="26" REF="011977_0025_0FB872940B562920">
mea&s;ure, the attenuating effects of the calomel, and al&s;o increa&s;e the coma.</P>
<P>THE operation of the calomel, as an expectorant will be very much promoted by a prudent u&s;e of oxymel of &s;quills, or lea&s;t that &s;hould purge, by ipecacoanha, given &s;o as to puke two or three times. We well know the good effects of vomits in humoural a&s;thmas, upon the &s;ame principle are they indicated in this di&s;ea&s;e, to relieve the lungs from a load of mucus with which they are oppre&s;&s;ed. They are &s;o far from being attended with any ill effects, (as has been apprehended) that in fact they never fail in &s;ome mea&s;ure to relieve the breathing. Doctor Fothergill particularly recommends them, and indeed the more the complaint has a tendency to putrefaction, they are the more nece&s;&s;ary, and will be found of greater utility; for in that ca&s;e the mucus and di&s;charge from the lungs, which chil|dren commonly &s;wallow, is very acrid, and unle&s;s frequently di&s;charged by puking, will erode the coats of the &s;tomach, and &s;pread the di&s;ea&s;e. And what Huxham &s;ays with regard to vomits, is &s;till more to our purpo&s;e, and of it&s;elf almo&s;t &s;ufficient to refute any prejudices which may have been con|ceived again&s;t them. <Q>In children it was often nece&s;&s;ary to make them puke frequently, with a little oxymel of &s;quills, e&s;&s;ence of antimony or the like, otherwi&s;e <HI>the va&s;t ama&s;s of tenacious mucus would quite choak them.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Huxham on the ulcerous &s;ore throat.

confirmed by experience, but has the united te&s;ti|monies of the be&s;t writers on the &s;ubject, Fother|gill, Huxham, and Dougla&s;s in its favour.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH Mercury is here con&s;idered as the ba&s;is of the cure, e&s;pecially in the beginning of this di&s;ea&s;e, it is by no means intended to condemn or omit the u&s;e of proper alexipharmics and anti|&s;eptics; of which the &s;erpentaria, contrayerva, and peruvian bark are the mo&s;t powerful, and have been u&s;ed with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s. Sweating is certainly one way, by which nature carries off this di&s;ea&s;e; in&s;omuch that Huxham declares he did not remember to have had one patient mi&s;carry, who fell into a &s;oft, ea&s;y, univer&s;al &s;weat: and therefore, whatever method of cure was pur&s;ued, this &s;hould be always connected with it. The patient &s;hould be kept in bed, and as the di&s;ea&s;e has a putrid tendency, the diaphoretics &s;hould be of the alexipharmic and anti&s;eptic kinds. The bark is certainly a mo&s;t powerful anti&s;eptic, and when the &s;ymptoms of putrefaction, &s;uch as a moi&s;t clammy &s;kin, highly putrid breath, and haemorrha|ges appear, mu&s;t be attended with advantage. But early in the di&s;ea&s;e, while the &s;kin continues dry, attended with a great difficulty of breathing, and the &s;ymptoms of inflammation rather than tho&s;e of putrefaction prevail, it &s;hould be omitted; and here the removal of the di&s;order &s;hould be attempted, chiefly by mercurials and mild &s;udorifics. And indeed the whole art, in the cure of this di&s;ea&s;e, depends upon properly timeing the&s;e reme|dies, and in&s;i&s;ting upon one or the other, as the &s;ymptoms of putrefaction, do more or le&s;s prevail. The &s;eneka &s;nake root has likewi&s;e been recom|mended, and certainly where children can be made
<PB N="28" REF="011977_0027_0FB8729834113940">
to take it, will promote the attenuating effects of the calomel: as an alexipharmic and anti&s;eptic, the Virginian &s;nake root is the mo&s;t powerful, but the contrayerva is the lea&s;t di&s;agreable, and children will on that account frequently take that the mo&s;t freely.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides a &s;alivation, and &s;weating, nature frequently carries off this di&s;ea&s;e by an eruption on the &s;kin, ulcers behind the ears, or in other parts of the body, or an external &s;welling of the throat, all of which &s;eem evidently to indicate the u&s;e of bli&s;ters. And accordingly Doctors Fothergill and Huxham recommend them, particularly Doctor Huxham, who &s;ays he has &s;ometimes bli&s;tered the throat from ear to ear with great &s;ucce&s;s. It has indeed been &s;aid, that they &s;ometimes produced mortifications, and that even the di&s;charge they occa&s;ioned, &s;eemed to be more than the patient could bear, but as I have never heard this remark confirmed, I cannot help imagining, that the ca&s;es in which they were tried, were particularly unfa|vourable, and more remarkably putrid than is u&s;ual; for in the child, who died on the eighth day, bli&s;ters were applied behind the ears, and they had not the lea&s;t appearance of mortification or gan|grene, even after the child's death. And in a ca&s;e of very great danger, which I lately met with, they were certainly of great &s;ervice, and very effectually &s;upplied the place of tho&s;e natural di&s;charges, by which nature carries off this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I WOULD recommend their application early in the di&s;ea&s;e, from the &s;ame principle that they are applied in inflammatory anginas or pleuri&s;ies, to relieve the throat and trachea, and to derive the
<PB N="29" REF="011977_0028_0FB872994589B1B0">
flow of humours from the internal, to the external parts.</P>
<P>AS the ca&s;e to which I refer was a very remarkable one, in which the di&s;ea&s;e was attended with &s;ome of the wor&s;t &s;ymptoms I have ever &s;een and the method I have been advi&s;ing was &s;trictly pur&s;ued, and attended with &s;ucce&s;s; I cannot help con&s;ider|ing this &s;ucce&s;s to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure a proof of the propriety of the treatment, and for that rea&s;on &s;hall here in&s;ert the ca&s;e at large.</P>
<P>THE patient was a child of about two years and a half old, who had complained for about a week of a &s;ore throat and hoar&s;ene&s;s. The day before I &s;aw her, &s;he had &s;ome difficulty of breathing, which on that day was greatly increa&s;ed, and exactly re|&s;embled the breathing of the children who&s;e ca&s;es I have before related, when mo&s;t &s;trangulated. Upon examining her throat I found the ton&s;ils &s;welled, inflamed, and covered with &s;loughs of a yellowi&s;h colour. Her breath was not in the lea&s;t offen&s;ive, her pul&s;e was &s;mall and fluttering, and her &s;kin pale and clammy. Two very large bli&s;ters were immediately applied, one behind each ear, &s;o as to meet at her throat. She took four grains of calo|mel, with a quarter of a grain of opium, and was directed to drink a decoction of Virginian &s;nake root, di&s;gui&s;ed with old metheg&s;in, as a common drink; and as her &s;kin was pale and clammy, &s;he had a cly&s;ter of one drachm of peruvian bark, and ten grains of the &s;nake root in milk, to be admi|ni&s;tered every &s;ix or eight hours; but of the&s;e &s;he received but one that night; and as we found &s;he did not retain them, they were &s;oon di&s;continued; nor could &s;he be prevailed on to drink but very <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the decoction.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="011977_0029_0FB8729AC71C01E0">I SAW her &s;everal times during the fir&s;t day, and &s;he appeared wor&s;e at each time. About eight that evening &s;he had &s;omething like a fit, and at nine, the &s;trangulation in her breathing was much increa&s;ed, her pul&s;e was &s;unk, her countenance changed, her no&s;e appeared to be pinched up; her eyes were fixed and gla&s;&s;y, a blue ring was ob&s;ervable about her mouth, and &s;he was comatous. I left her, expecting &s;he would &s;oon die. Her bli&s;ters had been dre&s;&s;ed a little before, had ri&s;en well, and di&s;charged freely; and within two or three hours, as I was informed by the watches who &s;at up with her, &s;he &s;eemed to revive. The next morning I was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, not only to find her living, but in a &s;itting po&s;ture, eating her breakfa&s;t, with little or no difficulty of breathing, having her natural countenance returned, with &s;ome colour in her cheeks, and her pul&s;e rather ri&s;en. At twelve o'clock, however, her breathing grew more difficult, and though not &s;o &s;trangulated as the day before, was very quick and unea&s;y. From this time for five days &s;he remained in a very dangerous &s;ituation, and gave but little rea&s;on to expect her recovery. Her breathing continued quick and laborious, and her voice was almo&s;t entirely gone; her pul&s;e was quick and low; &s;he &s;weated profu&s;ely, particularly at nights, and con&s;tantly lay in her bed in a comatous &s;ituation, giving however di&s;tinct an&s;wers when &s;poken to. I could di&s;cover nothing di&s;agreable in her breath, though &s;ometimes what &s;he brought up was a little offen&s;ive. During this time, and for many days after, the bli&s;ters di&s;charged very freely, and the matter of the di&s;charge was &s;o &s;harp and coro&s;ive as to inflame and erode the &s;kin almo&s;t from the chin to the brea&s;t-bone. She con&s;tantly took twice

a day three grains of calomel; and except the fir&s;t do&s;e without opium, until &s;he had taken upwards of thirty grains; and continued the u&s;e of the decoction of &s;nake root in as large quantites as &s;he could be prevailed on to take it. On the &s;eventh day from the time I fir&s;t &s;aw her, &s;he began to cough a good deal, with which &s;he expectorated pretty freely, and brought up &s;ome very tough mucus. She breathed more freely, opened her eyes and looked about with &s;ome &s;prightline&s;s, and drank a gla&s;s or two of wine. From this time &s;he gradually grew better, and by the fifteenth day from the time I &s;aw her, all her &s;ymptoms had left her, except great weakne&s;s, and &s;o remarkable a hoar&s;ene&s;s, or rather lo&s;s of voice, that it was with great difficulty &s;he could be heard; and a peculiar &s;en&s;ibility of the larynx, with regard to fluids, &s;o that the moment &s;he attempted to drink &s;he fell into a fit of coughing, although &s;he could &s;wallow &s;olid food without difficulty. This how|ever &s;oon left her, but her weakne&s;s and lowne&s;s of voice continued a much longer time, &s;o that in two months &s;he could hardly walk alone, or &s;peak in a tone above a whi&s;per.</P>
<P>WHEN ulcers appear behind the ears, or in dif|ferent parts of the body, they require a particular treatment; the di&s;charge &s;hould be encouraged by frequently wa&s;hing them with warm milk and water, and poultices of bread and milk, may be applied to them; but grea&s;y applications always do harm, as they check the di&s;charge: nor will they bear dige&s;tives. In &s;ome ca&s;es, however, after the di&s;charge had continued for a great length of time, it was found nece&s;&s;ary to check it, with a very weak &s;ollution of white Vitrol, which an&s;wered this

intention well; nor did I ever ob&s;erve any ill effects from it: But it was always u&s;ed with great caution, and never ventured on until the general virus of the di&s;ea&s;e, had been corrected by a previous u&s;e of Mercurials. In re&s;pect to gargles, I would entirely follow Doctor Fothergill's advice. Fomentations applied to the brea&s;t, and fumigations with the &s;teams of &s;ome mild aromatic herbs, and warm vinegar, not only give ea&s;e, but &s;erve, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, to attenuate the mucous in the Trachea; and by gently &s;timulating the lungs, rai&s;e a &s;light cough, and promote the expectoration. The treatment of any accidental &s;ymptoms, after endeavouring to form a ju&s;t idea of the di&s;ea&s;e, mu&s;t be left to the di&s;cretion of the phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>SUCH are the &s;entiments, which, from an atten|tive ob&s;ervation of the &s;ymptoms, and progre&s;s of this di&s;ea&s;e, I have entertained of its nature, and mo&s;t proper treatment. It is indeed a complaint formidable in its nature, and of a very doubtful event, &s;o that there is no wonder if parents in par|ticular &s;hould be greatly alarmed at the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of its approach: but, on the other hand, it is &s;trongly marked, and by a per&s;on of common ob&s;ervation, at all conver&s;ant in it, ea&s;ily known and di&s;tingui&s;hed. It has gone too much under the appellation of a &s;ore throat, and has by many been confounded with the common di&s;ea&s;es of that kind, &s;o that parents have often been greatly alarmed where there was no cau&s;e of fear, and much terrified where there was no &s;ymptom of danger. In truth, the throat, altho' frequently affected, is not the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e, and many have died where that has been entirely free from complaint; nor are &s;welled ton&s;ils, an inflammation in the throat, even where it &s;hould

happen to be &s;pecked, or a palate hanging to one &s;ide, any more the marks of this di&s;temper, than <HI>a very laborious breathing, a hoar&s;e hollow cough, and a peculiar change in the tone of the voice,</HI> unattended with inflammation, are the &s;igns of a common quin&s;ey. In reality, the wind-pipe and lungs are mo&s;t affected in this di&s;ea&s;e, and it is the di&s;|order of the&s;e organs which gives origin to its cha|racteri&s;tic &s;ymptoms, and con&s;titutes its danger. By attending to which, we &s;hall, at all times, be enabled to di&s;tingui&s;h this dangerous malady from any other di&s;temper, parents will be &s;aved much unnece&s;&s;ary pain and anxiety, and children pre&s;erved from the danger which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily attend an erronious treatment of their complaints.</P>
