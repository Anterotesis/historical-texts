<P>FIRST, THAT all men are by nature equally free and in|dependent, and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a &s;tate of &s;ociety, they cannot, by any c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ct, deprive or dive&s;t their po&s;terity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing pro|perty, and pur&s;uing and obtaining happine&s;s and &s;afety.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That all power is ve&s;ted in, and con&s;equently derived from, the people; that magi&s;trates are their tru&s;tees and &s;ervants, and at all times amenable to them.</P>
<P N="3">3d. That government is, or ought to be in&s;tituted for the com|mon benefit, protection and &s;ecurity, of the people, nation, or com|munity, of all the various modes and forms of government that is be&s;t, which is capable of producing the greate&s;t degree of happine&s;s and &s;afety, and is mo&s;t effectually &s;ecured again&s;t the danger of mal-admini&s;tration; and that wherever any government &s;hall be found inadequate or contrary to the&s;e purpo&s;es, a majority of the commu|nity hath an indubitable, unalienable, and indefe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ible right, to perform, alter, or aboli&s;h it, in &s;uch manner as &s;hall be judged mo&s;t conducive to the public weal.</P>
<P N="4">4th. That no man, or &s;et of men, are intitled to exclu&s;ive or &s;eparate emoluments or privileges from the community, but in con|&s;ideration of public &s;ervices; which, not being de&s;cendible, neither ought the offices of magi&s;trate, legi&s;lature, or judge, to be the hereditary.</P>
<P N="5">5th. That the Legi&s;lative and Executive powers of the &s;tate &s;hould be &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from the judicary; and that the members of the two fir&s;t may be re&s;trained from oppre&s;&s;ion, by feeling and participating the burthens of the people, they &s;hould at fixed periods, be reduced to a private &s;tation, return into that body from which they were originally taken, and the vacancies be &s;up|plied by frequent, certain, and regular elections, in which all, or any part of the former members, to be again eligible, or ineligible, as the laws &s;hall direct.</P>

<P N="7">7th. That all power of &s;u&s;pending law, or the execution of laws, by any authority without con&s;ent of the repre&s;entatives of the people, is injurious to their rights, and ought not to be exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P N="8">8th.

<P N="9">9th. That exce&s;&s;ive bail ought not to be required, nor exce&s;&s;ive fines impo&s;ed, nor cruel unu&s;ual puni&s;hments inflicted.</P>
<P N="10">10th. The general warrants, whereby any officer or me&s;&s;enger may be commanded to &s;earch &s;u&s;pected places without evidence of a fact committed, or to &s;eize any per&s;on or per&s;ons not named, or who&s;e offence is not particularly de&s;cribed and &s;upported by evi|dence, are grievous and oppre&s;&s;ive, and ought not to be granted.</P>
<P N="11">11th. That in controver&s;ies re&s;pecting property, and in &s;uits between man and man, the ancient trial by jury is preferable to any other, and ought to be held &s;acred.</P>
<P N="12">12th. That the freedom of the pre&s;s is one of the great bul|warks of liberty, and can never be re&s;trained but by di&s;potic governments.</P>
<P N="13">13th. That a well regulated militia, compo&s;ed of the body of the people trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and &s;afe defence of a free &s;tate; that &s;tanding armies, in time of peace, &s;hould be avoided, as dangerous to liberty; and that, in all ca&s;es, the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">|ry &s;hould be under &s;trict &s;ubordination to, and governed by, the civil power.</P>
<P N="14">14th. That the people have a right to uniform government; and therefore, that no government &s;eparate from, or independent of the government of Virginia, ought to be erected or e&s;tabli&s;hed within the limits thereof.</P>
