<P>_WHOEVER &s;eriou&s;ly views and wi&s;e|ly con&s;iders the Manners of Mankind, and brings them to the Te&s;t of right Rea&s;on, will be forced to receive the &s;ame melancholy Idea of them, repre&s;ented in
<PB N="4" REF="007193_0003_102B360633B7E9F8">this Text. The Words are <HI>Solomon's,</HI> who was not only an indefatigable Student of Nature, but an accurate Ob&s;erver of divine Providence, of the Conduct of Men, and the &s;everal Con&s;e|quences of Actions, divine and human. He here tells us the Re&s;ult of his Re&s;earches re&s;pect|ing the&s;e. As to <HI>Providence,</HI> that though God has a &s;pecial Regard to the Holy and Good; yet in external Things he makes no Difference; but <HI>all Things come alike to all.</HI> As to <HI>Mankind,</HI> that they take Occa&s;ion from the&s;e promi&s;cuous Di&s;pen&s;ations to commit Wickedne&s;s without Re&s;erve: <HI>Their Heart is full of Evil:</HI> for they ob&s;erve, that <HI>&s;uch as work Wickedne&s;s are &s;et up, and they who tempt God are even delivered.</HI> Mal. iii. 15. This has &s;ometimes been puzzling to the Pious, but has &s;truck the Ungodly with Madne&s;s. Hence it comes that <HI>Madne&s;s is in their Heart while they live.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Madne&s;s</HI> is a State of Irregularity and Di&s;|compo&s;ure. The Per&s;on affected with it, is not fixed in his Purpo&s;e; is not influenced in his Conduct by the mo&s;t engaging Motives; pays no Regard to the Dictates of right Rea|&s;on; nor is careful about what is decorous, profitable, di&s;advantageous, or dangerous.</P>
<P>Now we are a&s;&s;ured, by unerring Truth, that this is the State of the <HI>Sons of Men.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="007193_0004_102B362461034B40">'Tis true, they make high Pretences to Wi&s;|dom, and have a Shew of it; but <HI>the Wi&s;|dom of this World is Fooli&s;hne&s;s with God.</HI> 1. Cor. iii. 19. If Madne&s;s were concealed in the Heart we could not di&s;cover it: But <HI>out of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth &s;peaketh;</HI> Matth. xii. 34. and &s;o by Men's Words and Actions we come to know what is in their Hearts. Hence, a Cour&s;e of Life, contrary to right Rea&s;on, and ju&s;t Rules of Conduct, will evidence Heart-Madne&s;s.</P>
<P>In treating this Subject, I am naturally led to &s;hew wherein the Madne&s;s of human Hearts di&s;covers it&s;elf. This cannot be done, but by mentioning particular In&s;tances of human Con|duct.</P>
<P>And as I apprehend, that the Method of &s;uch a Narration is in a great Mea&s;ure arbi|trary, I &s;hall not attempt a nice Arrangement of the general Heads in natural Order; but pro|po&s;e them as they occur. And,</P>
<P N="1">I. Precipitant Conclu&s;ions concerning Per|&s;ons, Things, or Opinions, formed without Evidence, and often in Defiance of Demon|&s;tration to the contrary, di&s;cover a Degree of Madne&s;s. The Croud of Mankind determine the mo&s;t important Points, without weighing
<PB N="6" REF="007193_0005_102B3607D137AB48">the Rea&s;ons on both Sides of the Que&s;tion. In their own Imagination they quickly pene|trate Matters, which to the more Judicious are ab&s;tru&s;e and intricate. If they embrace Truth, it is by Accident. They contend not for Re|ligion, becau&s;e they &s;ee its proper Evidence; but becau&s;e they have been accu&s;tomed to it: And thus they may be orthodox and regu|lar Chri&s;tians, from no better Principles than tho&s;e from which the <HI>Turks</HI> are <HI>Mahometans,</HI> Nay, they form their Judgment of Religion, the highe&s;t Concern of all, with more In|difference than of the &s;mall Affairs of this Life. From hence ari&s;e the many &s;otti&s;h Opinions, wild Reveries, and de&s;tructive Here&s;ies, that pa&s;s for pure Religion with their re&s;pective Votaries, divide the chri&s;tianized World into &s;o many oppo&s;ite Parties, are contended for with a Peremptorine&s;s that knows not to yield to Argument, and promoted frequently with a bitter, &s;ometimes with a bloody, Zeal. What intelligent Chri&s;tian is there, who, without a Mixture of Pity and Contempt, can ob&s;erve the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ors of Wi&s;dom become Fools?</HI> Rom. i. 22. Hear the Dictates of eternal Wi&s;dom pronounced Folly, with a &s;upercilious Air? and fanciful Chimeras &s;ub&s;tituted in its Room? It would &s;eem as though the Faculty of Rea|&s;oning was, to many, given in vain; while one a&s;&s;erts the <HI>U&s;ele&s;ne&s;s</HI> of it in Religion,
<PB N="7" REF="007193_0006_102B3625ECCA08B0">another its <HI>Sufficiency,</HI> in our lap&s;ed State. This denies the Nece&s;&s;ity of any divine Re|velation; that a&s;&s;erts, every Circum&s;tance mu&s;t be immediately revealed. One thinks Saving Grace con&s;i&s;ts in moral Hone&s;ty, another places it in the Ob&s;ervation of invented Forms. One is a Libertine, who fancies he &s;erves GOD while he gratifies his Lu&s;ts; another is &s;uper|&s;titious, and thinks to plea&s;e <HI>him</HI> by monki&s;h Au&s;terities. One is content with a dead Faith, which neither <HI>purifies the Heart,</HI> nor <HI>works by Love;</HI> another is per&s;uaded he &s;hall be &s;aved by his good Works, though imperfect, without Faith in the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t. This lays the whole Stre&s;s on orthodox Prin|ciples; that thinks it indifferent what we believe. Some doubt not their Safety, be|cau&s;e they are of &s;uch a particular religious Denomination; others are of Opinion, that all Denominations &s;tand alike fair for Salvation. Here is a Bigot who e&s;teems every Circum|&s;tance in Religion to be e&s;&s;ential, and what|ever he believes to be right and true mu&s;t be a Term of Communion; there is a Lati|tudinarian who&s;e Religion has little or nothing in it that is important, or worthy to be ear|ne&s;tly contended for. Here unaffecting Spe|culation is triumphant; there Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion. Here Religion is dre&s;&s;ed in gaudy Attire, with <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> worldly Pomp,
<PB N="8" REF="007193_0007_102B360A5326A238" MS="y">in&s;omuch that its fir&s;t In&s;titution is hardly at all di&s;cernable; there the pure external Or|dinances of God him&s;elf are rejected with Scorn, from a &s;woln Conceit of Spirituality. Now all the&s;e contradictory Parties will be equally &s;tiff and po&s;itive in their Notions; yet are all equally extravagant and mon&s;trous: all oppo&s;ite to divine Revelation, and the Rea|&s;on of Things. And are all the&s;e, O my Soul! are <HI>all the&s;e</HI> the rational Sons of Men! Are all the&s;e <HI>&s;ure</HI> they are wi&s;e! Can Truth, di|vine Truth, be a Sy&s;tem&mdash;a <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> did I &s;ay? a <HI>Heap</HI> of Dotages! Can Rea&s;on, &s;trict Rea&s;on, approve Contradictions! or rather, mu&s;t we not a&s;&s;uredly conclude, that <HI>Madne&s;s is in their Heart while they live?</HI></P>
<P>Nor &s;hall we find more Wi&s;dom in their Judgment of Men than of Things. They conclude of Characters in the Lump: can hardly &s;ee any thing amiable and good where &s;ome Things di&s;plea&s;e; nor are Blemi&s;hes apt to be di&s;gu&s;tful where &s;ome good Qualities &s;hine. Superficial Defects hide &s;ub&s;tantial Ex|cellencies from the vulgar Eye; whil&s;t the Ab&s;ence of all valuable Accompli&s;hments is ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed by meer Sound, and empty Show. Wi&s;dom and Virtue, meanly cloathed, are de&s;pi&s;ed; whil&s;t Ignorance and Vice, dre&s;|&s;ed in Purple, are honoured. An ea&s;y Air and genteel Addre&s;s, often recommend Non|&s;en&s;e,
<PB N="9" REF="007193_0008_102B36281E4E1650">and make Flattery appear &s;incere; but an uncouth Mode will cau&s;e the &s;ame Per|&s;ons, to di&s;ieli&s;h undi&s;&s;embled Regard, and &s;olid Di&s;cretion. Even learned Criticks do &s;ometimes defend the very Ab&s;urdities of a favourite Author; and cen&s;ure what is truly &s;ublime in another. Whole Communities, nay, whole Nations, like under the Cen&s;ure which belongs only to a Part, and, perhaps, a &s;mall Part of them. Thus Mankind judge as though Rea&s;on taught them to make the Conclu&s;ion univer&s;al, when the Premi&s;es are only particular.</P>
<P N="2">II. Men judge not more precipit<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">tly than &s;peak and act incon&s;iderately. How <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">|quently may we &s;ee proper and impr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> confu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ed No Re&s;pect had to Time, or Place, or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">; nor a Thought of the obvious and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">oidable Con&s;equences? How many live as if there was no need of Caution, no po&s;&s;ible Danger of mi&s;&s;ing the Right, nor any Extreme to be feared?&mdash;As if nothing could follow from any Cour&s;e of Conduct, and a nece&s;&s;ary Cau&s;e would not produce its genuine Effect? &mdash; As if Prudence and Circum&s;pection were mere Names, and no Power of Deliberation had ever been given? They live at random, and &s;eem to con&s;ider Right and Wrong with ab&s;olute Indifference.
<PB N="10" REF="007193_0009_102B360C4A4E6D80" MS="y">In the religious Life, &s;ome are offen&s;ive, others &s;tumble and fall, and &s;ome take Of|fence when none is given. In the civil Life, many ruin them&s;elves in their worldly Affairs, and others too, by Indi&s;cretion. Some live above their Ability, engage in Matters too high for them, and fall by tho&s;e Means by which they thought to ri&s;e. The im|prudent Pur&s;uit of Grandeur brings others into Contempt, whil&s;t they indu&s;trious &s;eek to obtain a Character which they cannot &s;up|port; and climb to a Pinnacle where their Brains are turned, and they cannot &s;tand.</P>
<P>Many, in a devout Qualm, engage in a Cour&s;e of &s;trict Religion, without a rational Sen&s;e of its Importance, or <HI>counting the Co&s;t.</HI> Luke xiv. 28. They think not what Offences and &s;tumbling Blocks are in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &mdash; What Artifices of Satan, what A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="6 letters">ents of the Fle&s;h, and what Terrors of the World, are combined to turn them a&s;ide.&mdash;How <HI>&s;trait the Gate,</HI> how <HI>narrow the Path,</HI> Matth. vii. 14. how arduous the A&s;cent, and how deceitful and impotent their Souls.&mdash;What Self-denial, what Humblene&s;s of Mind, what Watchfulne&s;s and Care, and what Courage and determinate Re&s;olution, are requi&s;ite for the Purpo&s;e. They a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves that they will &s;tand firm again&s;t all A&s;&s;aults,
<PB N="11" REF="007193_0010_102B3629B4D76F70">though they were at no Pains to <HI>dig deep,</HI> and <HI>found them&s;elves on a Rock:</HI> Hence, when the <HI>Rain de&s;cends,</HI> when the <HI>Floods come,</HI> and the <HI>Winds blow,</HI> and <HI>beat upon them, they fall,</HI> Matth. vii. 26, 27. and are carried head|long down the Stream. Hence their <HI>Good|ne&s;s is as a Morning-Cloud,</HI> and vani&s;hes <HI>like the early Dew.</HI> Ho&s;. vi. 4. They either be|come profane, or are taken in the Snare of &s;ome delu&s;ive Opinion, or Here&s;y: <HI>They turn away their Ears from the Truth, and are turned into Fables:</HI> 2 Tim. iv. 4. And thus ends their Religion.</P>
<P N="3">III. Many appear to have fal&s;e Views of what is advantageous, or hurtful; and draw fal&s;e Inferences from Actions and Event. In how &s;trange a Light do they look on &s;trict Piety, who di&s;dain it as mean, or avoid it as un|plea&s;ant; and how come the Paths of Sin to appear honourable and bli&s;sful? Religious Per&s;ons, and &s;piritual Conver&s;ation, are by many &s;hunned as though they were dan|gerous, while the Loo&s;e and Profane are cho&s;en for Companions, as though they were mo&s;t &s;afe. They are not afraid to violate the Laws of God; yet they dread his threat|ned Vengeance. Hell is their Terror, Sin their Sport and Entertainment. They tremble at the Effect, yet delight in its proper
<PB N="12" REF="007193_0011_102B360EC9700FB8">Cau&s;e. But how ab&s;urd is it, mentally to &s;eparate Mi&s;ery from Sin, when they can never be &s;eparated in Fact? The eternal Rea&s;on of Things has made their Connexion inviolable.</P>
<P>What fal&s;e Apprehen&s;ions have many of their own Ca&s;es? The Aged and Infirm think of Years to come, and hence defer their intended Preparation for Death. The Drunkard never knows his Capacity, but thinks he may &s;afe|ly venture to take the other Gla&s;s: nor does the covetous Mi&s;er ever judge truly of his Nece&s;&s;ity; and therefore lives poor in the Mid&s;t of Plenty.</P>
<P>Every Occurrence is perverted. The Good|ne&s;s of GOD, which would &s;eem &s;ufficient to me<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> hard Hearts, and form them according to his Will, becomes a Mean of hardening them again&s;t him. If he gives to &s;ome Abundance of worldly Wealth, they u&s;e it as though it were a Licence given them to indulge Wan|tonne&s;s, Exce&s;s of Riot, Luxury, and all tho&s;e &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures, which to others are forbid|den. If Honour and Power are conferred on them, they act as though they were ad|vanced above a &s;crupulous Regard to the di|vine Commands. They &s;eem to &s;ay, <HI>Who is the Lord, that we &s;hould obey him?</HI> Exod. v. 2. Becau&s;e the Wicked pro&s;per, they con|clude
<PB N="13" REF="007193_0012_102B362BBA14BE70">it is quite &s;afe to follow their Ways: And <HI>becau&s;e Sentence again&s;t an evil Work is not &s;peedily executed,</HI> Eccle&s;. viii. 11. they are bold in Impiety, pre&s;uming on perpe|tual Impunity. They &s;ee Men de&s;pi&s;e Pie|ty, and even &s;it in the Scorner's Chair, yet no vi&s;ible Evil befals them; hence &s;ome are tempted to think divine Threats are but Bug-bears, and Religion but a Fancy. On the contrary, pious People are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, often &s;everely reproached and run down, and no vi&s;ible Regard manife&s;ted for all their Care to plea&s;e God: Upon this others readily de|termine, that <HI>it is vain to &s;erve him.</HI> Mal. iii. 14. Some, who made a plau&s;ible Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of &s;trict Religion, fall away, and prove them&s;elves, by their After-conduct, to have been but Hypocrites: Therefore, others care|fully avoid every Appearance of Piety, that they may avoid Hypocri&s;y: They expect to be counted hone&s;t and upright, when they are openly wicked, and glory in their Shame.</P>
<P N="4">IV. There are Numbers who do not &s;o much as attempt to form their Judgment, or regulate their Practice, by Rea&s;on. They follow the Vogue without Scruple.

Let their Conduct be irrational, let it be wicked too, provided only it be fa&s;hionable. Has it a Multitude to patronize it? then 'tis no Mat|ter though it cannot &s;tand the Te&s;t of Scripture; no, nor of common Sen&s;e. The Croud, like a Torrent, carries the&s;e along, and they lo&s;e them&s;elves in it. Their weak Minds are con|fu&s;ed with the Tumult, and made <HI>giddy with the Glare of worldly Pomp.</HI> Sedate Thought and calm Rea&s;on, by Means of numberle&s;s airy Vanities, lo&s;e their Weight, and are re|&s;olved into Fume and Vapour. In this Plight, it is no Wonder that they e&s;teem tho&s;e con|temptibly weak who chu&s;e rather to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the Cen&s;ure of the World, than to offend God. They judge Reli|gion it&s;elf by the Fa&s;hion. By that they determine which of the divine Commands it is proper to obey; and which of them, for the &s;ake of Decency, is to be laid a&s;ide. If religious Di&s;cour&s;e is reckoned unpolite, a &s;erious Expre&s;&s;ion will &s;hock a gay Com|pany, and a few would go near to di&s;|per&s;e them. Though it is the Will of God, that Sin &s;hould be reproved, and the Sinner made a&s;hamed; yet we would offend again&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="007193_0014_102B362EC0CE9E88">modern Politene&s;s, &s;hould we di&s;cover even a calm Di&s;approbation of what is wicked|ly &s;poken or acted in Company. They who would be quite acceptable to this World, mu&s;t, <HI>at lea&s;t &s;eem,</HI> to approve what GOD condemns, that &s;o none may ever be made unea&s;y by their Pre&s;ence. They mu&s;t <HI>&s;ay to every one that de&s;pi&s;es the LORD,</HI> and <HI>that walks after the Imagination of his Heart, ye &s;hall have Peace, and no Evil &s;hall come upon you.</HI> Jer. xxiii. 17. But &s;urely, <HI>the Friend&s;hip of the World is Enmity with God.</HI> Jam. iv. 4.</P>
<P>But let us proceed further, and take a View of Men who mi&s;take not their Duty; who acknowledge the Things <HI>that are excellent, being in&s;tructed out of the Law;</HI> and we can|not but conclude that they exceed in Mad|ne&s;s. For,</P>
<P N="5">V. Multitudes continually counteract their Judgment and Con&s;cience, when rightly in|formed. They own the Soul to be more ex|cellent than the Body, yet are mo&s;t anxious to provide for the latter. They &s;pare not Co&s;t and Pains to cure a bodily Di&s;temper, while the immortal Spirit, all di&s;ordered, is quite neglected. Remedies are carefully &s;ought for an Head-ach; but none for an hard Heart. A Fever is deplored; irregular and di&s;torted
<PB N="16" REF="007193_0015_102B36132527BFD0">Pa&s;&s;ions are indulged. The Body is gorgeous|ly cloathed, and delicately fed, while the Soul is naked, without Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and no Bread of Life &s;ought after for its Nouri&s;hment. It is of more Value than the <HI>the whole World,</HI> yet is bartered away for a very &s;mall Part of it; for Vanity, for Songs, for Triffles. That Heaven is infinitely preferable to this Earth, eternal Glory to temporal Felicity, is not di&s;|puted; yet Sinners chu&s;e to live here always. They are con&s;cious to them&s;elves, that they would de&s;ire no other Kind of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s that this World affords, could they but <HI>&s;till</HI> enjoy it, and enjoy it <HI>fully;</HI> and hence gra&s;p the Pre&s;ent, regardle&s;s of the Future. They acknowledge, that they &s;hould make it the very Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Life to plea&s;e God, and that his Fa|vour is more valuable than the Favour of all Mankind; yet they gratify their Appe|tites and Humours, when they know they di&s;plea&s;e him in &s;o doing: and if they &s;tand fair in the Opinion of Men, are quite care|le&s;s about his Approbation. They commend Virtue, but practi&s;e Vice; and while they own, that Wickedne&s;s is the Way to Hell, walk boldly on in that Way at all Adven|tures.</P>
<P>They confe&s;s, that Rea&s;on &s;hould guide, and the Pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould be governed by its
<PB N="17" REF="007193_0016_102B2315749E5A28">Dictates; yet when their Pa&s;&s;ions become clamorous, the Voice of Rea&s;on is drowned, and its loude&s;t Remon&s;trations no more heard. The covetous Man is drawn into Ab&s;urdi|ties by the Love of Money, the Voluptious harries on in Pur&s;uit of ruining Plea&s;ures, and Thir&s;t of Prai&s;e carries the Ambitious headlong.</P>
<P>They make no &s;uitable Improvement of their own Experiences, nor correct pa&s;t Fol|lies by After-ob&s;ervation. The World and its evil Cu&s;toms are infectious; they have been often caught in the &s;ame Snare, yet never learn to be guarded and circum&s;pect. The Review of pa&s;t Scenes of guilty Plea|&s;ures gives griping Remor&s;e; the pre&s;ent do not &s;atisfy, yet many Trials convince them not that the future will &s;urely di&s;appoint them. After drinking to Exce&s;s, the Heart is thir&s;ty; and Hunger &s;ucceeds the mo&s;t plenteous Repa&s;t. <HI>In the mid&s;t of Laughter the Heart is &s;orrowful, and the End of that Mirth is Heavine&s;s.</HI> Prov. xiv. 13. For often|times Rea&s;on is debauched, the Con&s;cience feared, the Pa&s;&s;ions inflamed, the Con&s;titu|tion broken, E&s;tate ruined, and the Per&s;on de&s;pi&s;ed.
