<P>IN Troth this Demand alarms me. I have endeavoured to put a good Face on the Matter; but I really dread the Con&s;equence. <HI>A full Moiety of Fourteen Thou&s;and Cocks of Hay, with Boot and Emblements and all!</HI> I cannot think of it with Patience. But I am told that I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> think of it. My late <HI>Chums</HI> and <HI>Cronies! where are you all now?</HI> Such a Moiety to refund, and left in the Lurch! Hah <HI>Friend&s;hip!</HI> where art thou? But it was my own darling Doctrine, (and hang me for having ever preached it) <HI>not to value any man longer than he is able to &s;erve you.</HI> My Di&s;ciples, like apt Scholars, have imbibed the Maxim, and will now play off the <HI>Argumentum ad Hominem</HI> again&s;t their poor old <HI>Democritus,</HI> without Mercy. But People &s;o obliged, and &s;o virtually ve&s;ted with all my Influence and Authority throughout the whole Hamlet! For them, to de&s;ert me in my &s;ore&s;t Extremity! But <HI>Tempora mutantur, et nos mutamur cum illis.</HI> Come, then, <HI>Fate,</HI> my old Divinity, &s;tand by me! Come <HI>Fortune,</HI> hitherto propitious, and &s;uccour thy con&s;tant Favourite! But what are <HI>Fate</HI> and <HI>Fortune</HI> to a Chancery Suit for <HI>Seven Thou&s;and Cocks of Hay?</HI> Like a huge Cake of Ice at the opening of Hud&s;on's River,
<PB N="2" REF="011702_0003_0F87EB531E6572C8">
it advances with a &s;low but re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Motion, &s;weeping away in its Progre&s;s, the &s;tronge&s;t oppo&s;ing Hou&s;e or Barn, even as the weake&s;t&mdash;Drum&s;tick. <HI>One half of all my Harve&s;t! A full and complete Moiety! An equal Divi&s;ion of Fourteen Thou&s;and Cocks of Hay!</HI> 'Tis uncon&s;cionable. O how I mow'd with all my might and Main again&s;t the Expiration of the Lea&s;e! And how my Friends labour'd like Emmets, to get it hou&s;ed before that fatal Period! A goodly Crop it was; and never before did the &s;ame Farm produce the like. But no &s;ooner has my Landlord's Agent entered the Clo&s;e to make his Demand, but away fly my Workmen, pell mell and helter &s;kelter, with Carts, and Waggons, and Teams, and Forks, and Rakes; leaving me, like the D&mdash; of C&mdash;, <HI>with Nobody by me but my&s;elf.&mdash;One half of the whole Crop with the Emblements and Appurtenances, and Hay-Boot, and E&s;tovers and all!</HI> Not I, indeed. I will hold fa&s;t as long as I can. The <HI>Habendum</HI> and <HI>Tenendum,</HI> are worth all the re&s;t of the longe&s;t Deed in the World. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is eleven Points of the Law. But where is the <HI>Title</HI> to be tried? Aye, that's the Devil. What a Fool was I to kick up a Du&s;t again&s;t Juries? 'Tis the be&s;t Tryal in the World; and the grand Bulwark of Engli&s;h Liberty. But can it be ju&s;t? Can it be right, that my Land-lord &s;hould have half of all my Earnings? <HI>A full and equal,</HI> and (oh the frightful Thought!) <HI>to-be-divided</HI> Moiety? Is it
<PB N="3" REF="011702_0004_0F87EB53DE667C68">
by Virtue of a Condition precedent, or &s;ub&s;equent? I remember no &s;uch Clau&s;e in the Lea&s;e. <HI>Refund! Refund!</HI> and that, <HI>an equal Moiety?</HI> I think I can prove the contrary by expre&s;s Law. I rai&s;ed the Crop my&s;elf. That was my own Act. If I am compelled to refund half, that will not be my own Act, but the Act of another, and con&s;equently tortious. This Authority may be found in Judge <HI>Hale,</HI> in his Chapter of <HI>Juries.</HI> I have often thought of <HI>Action</HI> and <HI>Re-action,</HI> in a <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> Sen&s;e; but Perdition, I &s;ay, to this <HI>Re-action,</HI> in the <HI>Law</HI> Sen&s;e. But it &s;eems I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> think of it: And truly it is not now a Time to &s;trut and &s;wagger. My Landlord is powerful: My Sons are his Tenants at Will: His Agent is inflexible: My Friends are &s;hrunk into Non-Entity: And I may be called to an Account <HI>pour autros Cho&s;es.</HI> Be&s;ides, if the Moon will get in Oppo&s;ition to the Sun, &s;he may depend upon being <HI>eclip&s;ed:</HI> And this Conte&s;t of mine will probably be con&s;idered as our Meeting in the <HI>Nodes of the Ecliptic,</HI> upon which &s;uch <HI>Ob&s;curation</HI> always en&s;ues. 'Tis truly an intricate Point. Would to my Stars that I could prevent this <HI>Eclip&s;e,</HI> by driving away the <HI>Sun</HI> as the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> formerly attempted to do on the like Occa&s;ion, by Beat of <HI>Kettle Drum!</HI> I'm weary of Conjectures. I think I will either challenge the Array, or plead the Benefit of the Clergy. But hold&mdash;that is not the Ca&s;e in Chancery. Pox on it, then I

will convey the Whole in Tru&s;t. Aye, but the Interrogatories upon Oath! In what an inextricable Quondary am I plung'd! I really think a Trial by Juries the wi&s;e&s;t Contrivance in the World. But this <HI>&s;wearing&mdash;&s;wearing&mdash;&s;wearing!</HI> Oh for a Draught of the River <HI>Lethe,</HI> to deface the Memory of all my <HI>Receptions!</HI> Then I could an&s;wer plump, <HI>I know nothing about it.</HI> But am I obliged to di&s;cover <HI>all</HI> my Profits? Suppo&s;e I have &s;old my Hay for more than the Market Price. Suppo&s;e I had found the <HI>Philo&s;opher's Stone</HI> upon the demi&s;ed Premi&s;es, &mdash;What is all that to the <HI>u&s;ual, cu&s;tomary</HI> and <HI>annual</HI> Profits of the Farm? Is a Man to get nothing by his own Genius and Invention? Suppo&s;e again, that Neighbour <HI>Hob&s;on,</HI> reduced to great Extremity, and obliged to move the Day before his Spou&s;e expected to lay in, has paid me (I, do you &s;ee me? improving that Occurrence according to Cu&s;tom) Twenty Shillings a Day for the Hire of my Team, when the &s;tated Price is only Ten. Can my Landlord, upon his own Principles of a Moiety of my &s;tated Earnings, demand more than Five? Surely he does not de&s;ire to participate in my Extortions? He cannot expect more by Rea&s;on of <HI>Goody Hob&s;on</HI>'s being within a Day of her Reckoning. 'Twas my own per&s;onal Dexterity that mounted that Day's Hire from Ten to Twenty. And if this will do, I &s;hall &s;ecure Three-fourths
<PB N="5" REF="011702_0006_0F87EB555E630998">
of the greate&s;t Part of the Matter in Controver&s;y. For that in Fact is the Ca&s;e with above Nine-tenths, of all the Profits I ever received. But <HI>one full Moiety of all!</HI> I cannot part with it. Such <HI>Re-action</HI> would be the mo&s;t unprofitable Action of my Life; and &s;uch <HI>Refund,</HI> the wor&s;t of all Funds. <HI>The full Half of all my Profits!</HI> What! of every Hen, and Duck, and Chick, and Egg, and Calf, and Colt, and Pig, with a thou&s;and <HI>Etcaeteras,</HI> which are no more appurtenant to the genuine natural I&s;&s;ues of the Premi&s;es, than if I had received them upon the High Way? I cannot. Po&s;itively I cannot bear the Thought. My Landlord will not in&s;i&s;t upon it. I once had Merit; and it is not long &s;ince that I flattered my&s;elf to have been made <HI>Tenant for Life.</HI> Certain it is, that I have greatly improved the Freehold; and every Body knows that the Farm, while in my Tenure, has yielded, by the bare Dint of my Hu&s;bandry, ten fold more than ever it did before. Who then could have put him upon this new-fangled pernicious Scheme of <HI>one half of all the Profits?</HI> Surely he has heard &s;ome &s;trange Tales to my Prejudice. Can he have learnt that I &s;uffered one of his Servants, and <HI>merely becau&s;e he was his Servant,</HI> to be turn'd out of Doors, when I could have prevented it by a &s;ingle Word? In this I own, I did not con&s;ult his Intere&s;t, agreeable to my con&s;tant Profe&s;&s;ions. But then it was only the Sin of <HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI> to
<PB N="6" REF="011702_0007_0F87EB561E70A9E0">
gratify tho&s;e who would not be my Friends, but upon the Terms of that violent Mea&s;ure. Or can he have heard that I have been bribed, to permit the Neighbours to encroach upon &s;everal of his Franchi&s;es, when it redounded to my own Emo|lument, tho' greatly to his Di&s;advantage? Why, it was only to oblige the very &s;ame Set of Friends; and I flattered my&s;elf that I had &s;o glo&s;&s;ed the Matter, with his Honour and Intere&s;t, and Power, and Dignity, and all that, (which I have con&s;tantly at my Fingers Ends) that he would never have detected me. But had I fore&s;een this Con&s;equence, I can a&s;&s;ure them, I had preferred their former Cur&s;es to their late Cringings; and followed my old Practice of making <HI>Money, Money,</HI> my &s;ole and only Friend. But then what Rea&s;on had I to believe any Man &s;incere? O dear-bought Experience, of what I could &s;o ea&s;ily have read in my own Brea&s;t! O that I could once more get Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;weet delightful old Tenement! A beau|tiful Spot it was; and many, many a golden Harve&s;t has it produced me.</P>
<Q>O mihi proeter itos referet &s;i Jupiter Annos!</Q>
<P>But &s;omething, they &s;ay, mu&s;t be done; and &s;peedily done. For the Agent is in full Chace; and after a few Doublings more, the old Fox will certainly be out of Wind. Why, and &s;omething I &s;hould be willing to do. <HI>But the Half of all my Profits!</HI> Skin for

Skin, what will not a Man do to &s;ave his Money? <HI>An equal Divi&s;ion!</HI> There is not a more nau&s;eous Bolus in the whole Di&s;pen&s;atory. I have read, when I lately commenced <HI>com|mon Pleader,</HI> of the <HI>Moiety</HI> of an <HI>Advow&s;on,</HI> and of the <HI>Ad|vow&s;on</HI> of a <HI>Moiety,</HI> and of fifty other <HI>Moieties;</HI> but never a Syllable of the <HI>Moiety</HI> of my <HI>Profits,</HI> nor of the <HI>Profits</HI> of my <HI>Moiety. Melchizedek,</HI> I have heard my Father &s;ay, was &s;a|tisfied with a <HI>Tenth</HI> of the <HI>Spoil;</HI> and Decimation would make no great Hole in the Reckoning, But a <HI>full, equal, perfect, ab&s;olute, entire, compleat, whole and total Moiety!</HI> There is no &s;uch Thing in all <HI>Hobb's Leviathan.</HI> But then in Ca&s;e of Refu&s;al, who will &s;tand by me? Aye, that's the Que&s;tion. My greate&s;t Beneficiaries have abandoned me. Mo&s;t of the Tenants remember my old Pranks, as how I have told his Honor a thou&s;and Fibs about them, and endeavoured to &s;pirit him up to rai&s;e his Rent-roll. The Lawyers, whom I have &s;o &s;currilou&s;ly treated, cannot in Honour be <HI>for</HI> me: And <HI>again&s;t</HI> me are the <HI>Powers,</HI> the <HI>Powers,</HI> the <HI>Powers.</HI> O the Vici&s;&s;itude of human Affairs!

I know very well that there is &s;uch a Clau&s;e in the Lea&s;e; and that I took the Farm upon that expre&s;s Condition.

<P>But &s;tay, &s;tay, I think I have it. Yes, po&s;itively I have it.&mdash;<HI>Strike up the Drums! Huzza! Long live the King!</HI> I have it, I have it.&mdash;I will even take Refuge in a <HI>Petition of Dolence;</HI> for in a mo&s;t <HI>daleful</HI> Condition I am. I will blazon my old Services, and conceal my recent Iniquities. My Landlord is bountiful; and at Repre&s;entation, aye and at Mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion too, who a greater Adept than my&s;elf? Let us try what they'll amount to.</P>
<P N="1">I. In the Year 1747, I &s;tood by a favourite Tenant of my Landlord's, who had got the ill-will of the whole Hamlet; and took the &s;ole Management of his Bu&s;ine&s;s upon my&s;elf.
<PB N="11" REF="011702_0012_0F87EB59DE5C1070">
In this I certainly have Merit. <HI>Unle&s;s his Honour &s;hould have heard that I received Ten Shillings a Day for the Service.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. I once took it into my Head from a Hint in a Letter of one of my Landlord's Attornies (which by the Way I knew meant no &s;uch Thing) to embark in a very trouble&s;ome Af|fair, which I was certain would greatly aggrandize his Power; and indeed render him the Sovereign Arbiter of all the Pro|perty of his Tenants. It was this. I pretended that it was his po&s;itive Order, in meer Affection to them, and for the greater Security of their E&s;tates, that he &s;hould re-examine all their Quarrels and Di&s;putes, after having before been &s;et|tled by their Neighbours. To induce their Compliance, which I knew in point of Time and Expence, would reduce them to Beggary, I vilified all the u&s;ual Arbitrators in that Part of the Country, and in&s;i&s;ted that no Per&s;on in the World ex|cept my Landlord alone, could po&s;&s;ibly give a right Judg|ment in any Ca&s;e. I was upon the very Verge of carrying the Point, when the Lawyers &s;et them&s;elves in Array again&s;t me; and compelled me to drop the Project, after the generality of the Tenants appeared to acquie&s;ce in it. I did not however tamely yield the Di&s;pute. No, No, that was never any fail|ing of mine, when I intended to ingratiate my&s;elf with his Honor. I determined to &s;ee it out to the Butt's End. I bor|rowed Law Books. I &s;tudied Law. I wre&s;ted Authorities.
<PB N="12" REF="011702_0013_0F87EB5A9E5CF300">
I pleaded. I twi&s;ted and turned. I fretted and foamed. In &s;hort I toil'd and moil'd, and tore and &s;wore, and thunder'd and blunder'd, and di&s;charged my Law as a Conjuror &s;pits Fire. But all to no Manner of Purpo&s;e. That dete&s;table Ne&s;t of Hornets, (whom I have hated ever &s;ince) per&s;uaded the whole Village, (which by the bye, was the real Truth of the Matter) that my Mea&s;ure, if carried into Execution, would not leave a &s;ingle Tenant &s;o much as Salt to his Por|ridge. This was &s;urely Merit, <HI>unle&s;s my Landlord knows that my &s;ecret View was only to plea&s;e him, in Expectation of &s;ecuring a Lea&s;e for Life.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. I have great Merit in the many Letters I have wrote to his Attornies, containing Schemes for encrea&s;ing his Emo|luments; and more than doubling his <HI>Rental.</HI> I remember I once projected to him how his Tenants might be made to burn Brick without Fuel; and that I could extract Gold-du&s;t from their Urine. Nay, at a particular Time I went &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ure him, that if he would furni&s;h me with &s;ufficient Force to protect the Workmen, again&s;t tho&s;e who I feared, might di&s;pute the Title, I would undertake to open a Mine in his Manor, that &s;hould nett him above ten thou&s;and Pounds Sterling per Annum. At other Times I endeavoured to con|ciliate his Favour, by traducing the mo&s;t faithful of his Te|nants:
<PB N="13" REF="011702_0014_0F87EB5B5E59A358">
As that they were debauched and di&s;affected.&mdash;That they would often make free with his Name over their Liquor; and drink the Health of his greate&s;t Enemy, <HI>Le Chevalier Wou'd be.</HI> Surely all this mu&s;t be real &s;ub&s;tantial Merit: and I well remember that Neighbour <HI>Frank</HI> for le&s;s than half of the <HI>Rodomontades</HI> I have tran&s;mitted, was lately made a <HI>Ju&s;tice of the Quorun;</HI> and now &s;truts with his new <HI>Cockade</HI> &s;o as &s;carcely to know his old Acquaintance. <HI>And though in the&s;e Mea&s;ures Self-intere&s;t was my only Motive,</HI> I think it impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould have &s;een through my De&s;ign.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, and <HI>Finis coronat opus.</HI> My Landlord once took a Notion of having all the Hor&s;es and Cattle of his Tenants marked and branded, they paying &s;o much a Head to the Agents whom he appointed for that Purpo&s;e. But on &s;end|ing the <HI>Marking-irons,</HI> the Tenants ro&s;e in a Body; and at|tempted to &s;eize and de&s;troy the <HI>notarial In&s;truments,</HI> &s;tock and block. Upon this, in &s;heer Fidelity to his Intere&s;t (expecting however a &s;mall Gratuity in the End, if his Honor &s;hould be &s;o minded) I took all the Irons into my own Tenement. To re&s;cue them out of my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they attacked the Me&s;|&s;uage. Determined to repel the A&s;&s;ault, I threw up Trenches, fortified the Pa&s;&s;es, covered the Fences with Bru&s;h, and fur|ni&s;hed up every Sword, Pi&s;tol, Bayonet, and Fowling-piece in
<PB N="14" REF="011702_0015_0F87EB5C1E588E00">
the Hou&s;e. I pierced the Garret for three&s;core Mu&s;kets. I ordered a Chauldron of boiling Water into the third Story; and di&s;po&s;ed of my Dung-cart, ready loaded, to defend the Po&s;tern. I ca&s;t four pewter Urinals into Bullets; and con|verted an old Frying-pan into a Brea&s;t-plate. I turned two Spits into Spiers, and &s;ix Bra&s;s Kettles into as many Drums. Of my Mu&s;tard-grinder I made an excellent Bomb; and a very comfortable Helmet of an half worn Iron Chafing-di&s;h. Thus fortified and accoutred, and looking like <HI>Mars,</HI> as one Egg is like another. I called to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance a tru&s;ty Band of his Dependents; and threatened to return the Attack, by &s;et|ting Fire to every Hut, Cottage, Barn, Hovel, Cow-pen, Dove-hou&s;e, Hen-roo&s;t, Barrack, and Stable, on the whole E&s;tate. In &s;hort, I di&s;played the mo&s;t heroic Conduct; and though I never had any Connection with military Affairs, &s;ave in a certain Capacity that requires neither Powder nor Ball, I exhibited both the Skill and Bravery of the mo&s;t experienced General; and finally pre&s;erved all the Irons from the medita|ted De&s;truction. To revenge their Di&s;appointment, the In|&s;urgents carried off, and burnt my Wheel-barrow; and con|&s;igned to the &s;ame Fate two of my Family Pictures, <HI>the Devil's</HI> and <HI>my own.</HI> But effectually to prevent their renewing the Siege, I ordered a Detachment in the dead of Night, to take off the Locks, and p&mdash;s in the Barrels of every Mu&s;ket in the Vicinity.</P>

If thou de&s;erte&s;t me now, thou art a Vixen. For it mu&s;t not go. I can never&mdash;never&mdash;never part with it.</P>
