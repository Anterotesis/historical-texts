Sometimes men are called ble&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e &s;ome &s;pecial ble&s;&s;ing is be&s;towed on them, or &s;hall be be&s;towed upon them.

<Q>Tho&s;e Men are ble&s;&s;ed, to whom the Divinity of Je&s;us of Nazereth is revealed, not by fle&s;h and blood, but by the Father that is in Heaven.</Q>
<P>The Divinity of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is abundantly taught in the Old Te&s;tament: That the Fa|ther hath begotten Him, <HI>P&s;al</HI> 27. That he is <HI>Davids</HI> Lord, <HI>P&s;al</HI> 110.1. That He is the Mighty God, and the Everla&s;ting Father, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 9 6. That He is Jehovah our Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3 36. That His goings forth have been from of old, from Everla&s;ting, <HI>Mic.</HI> 5.2. That He was the Man that was Gods Fellow, <HI>Zech.</HI> 13.7. And this is abundantly declared in the New Te&s;tament, That Je&s;us of Nazereth is the Son of God: He Him&s;elf gave witne&s;s to it, <HI>Joh.</HI> 9.37. And He accepted of that con|fe&s;&s;ion from others: from <HI>Nathanael, Joh.</HI> 1.49, 50. from <HI>Peter</HI> in the Text; from <HI>Thomas, Joh.</HI> 20 28, 29. And it is abundantly witne&s;|&s;ed unto by in&s;pired men: &s;o by <HI>John</HI> the Bap|ti&s;t, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.29. &s;o by the Apo&s;tles in their Wri|tings: this we all acknowledge. But there be a Number of men to whom this is revea|led
<PB N="5" REF="001584_0006_0FB3D643D2778618">by the Father that is in Heaven, and tho&s;e are ble&s;&s;ed men. They are of divers quali|ties and degrees; but what-ever their enjoy|ments be, what-ever their calamities, their in|firmities, their temptations, their iniquities be, they are ble&s;&s;ed Men. If this has been revealed by God to them, they &s;hall partake in Glory at the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. If God have revealed the glory of Chri&s;t to them, Glory &s;hall be revealed in them, if they par|take of this light they &s;hall partake of the In|heritance of the Saints in light.</P>
<P>Three <HI>Propo&s;itions</HI> are here to be &s;poken to.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>It is a difficult thing to be indeed convinced that Je&s;us of Nazereth is God.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> deny this, and &s;o do the <HI>Socinians</HI> in the &s;en&s;e that the Scriptures teach it. It is ea&s;y to be convinced of &s;ome truths, becau&s;e &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on do teach them: but this is a thing known purely by revelation: Natural rea&s;on makes no di&s;covery of it, and carnal rea&s;on has many objections again&s;t it. Men are naturally blind, and the Devil by carnal rea|&s;onings makes them more blind, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4 4.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is a &s;eeming impo&s;&s;ibility in it.</HI> There is an infinite di&s;tance between God and
<PB N="6" REF="001584_0007_0FB3D645557C55F0">Man, and that they &s;hould be United in One is beyond our comprehen&s;ion. That God &s;hould be Man and Man &s;hould be God, &s;eem to imply a contradiction. There is a &s;eeming nece&s;&s;ity that if there be two Natures in Chri&s;t, there mu&s;t al&s;o be two Per&s;ons, and that if there be but One Per&s;on, there is likewi&s;e but one Nature. It is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible that the divine Nature &s;hould be an humane Na|ture, or that the humane Nature &s;hould be a divine Nature. And it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible that the &s;ame Per&s;on &s;hould be both God and Man. Hence there aro&s;e &s;o many Here&s;ies in the Pri|mitive Church. The <HI>Manichees</HI> and <HI>Arians</HI> denyed the Divine Nature of Chri&s;t: &s;ome of them &s;aid, He was a meer Man. The <HI>Mar|cionites</HI> denyed the Humane Nature of Chri&s;t, they &s;aid He only appeared in an humane Shape, as in the time of the Old Te&s;tament: and as the Angels did often appear. The <HI>Eu|tychians</HI> denyed Him to be di&s;tinct God and Man, they confounded the two Natures, &s;aid He had one Nature made of a Divine and Hu|mane. Many Men have been confounded to conceive, That the Natures are di&s;tinct and yet the Per&s;on the &s;ame. And the <HI>Socinians</HI> at this day, though they acknowledge that
<PB N="7" REF="001584_0008_0FB3D646D148BA78">Chri&s;t is God, yet do deny that He is the E|ternal and Increated God. <HI>Ne&s;torius</HI> taught that Chri&s;t was two Per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There is &s;eeming improbability in it.</HI> If it be granted that 'tis not impo&s;&s;ible, yet it &s;eems improbable.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It &s;eems improbable that God would &s;o conde&s;cend.</HI> It is conde&s;cention for God to have any Communion with Men. It was con|de&s;cention for God to appear to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and to be familiar with <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> Man is but a worm, <HI>Job</HI> 25 6. And it mu&s;t needs be great conde&s;cention for God to be made fle&s;h; to be manife&s;ted in fle&s;h. It would be matter of admiration, if a Prince &s;hould Marry a Poor Woman: but this is more, God mu&s;t &s;toop very low to do this: this was too much to ex|pect, before it was revealed: It would have been impudence to have asked it of God. The Angels of Heaven did not imagine &s;uch a thing, if it had been propo&s;ed to them, they would have thought, that it had been too much. God has &s;hewed a great deal of kind|ne&s;s to the holy Angels, but there is nothing parallel to this. It &s;eems as if it would be an undervaluing, and forgetting his own Superi|ority. It &s;eems very unlikely that He would
<PB N="8" REF="001584_0009_0FB3D6485266C120">take upon him a Nature made out of the du&s;t, that is exalted but one degree above the bea&s;ts. A Nature compa&s;&s;ed about with In|firmities, a Nature inferiour to the Angels, a Nature liable to hunger and thir&s;t, and weari|ne&s;s, and pain, and death. It &s;eems as if it were too much for love to do: That He would di&s;dain to appear on earth in a mean outward appearance: That it &s;hould be &s;aid when He appeared in the form of a Servant, That this is God, This is He that you are to Wor&s;hip and Adore.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It &s;eems improbable that He &s;hould be wil|ling &s;o to advance Je&s;us of Nazereth.</HI> It was a great thing that He &s;hould advance <HI>David</HI> from being a Shepherd to Rule His People I&s;rael: he &s;ays, <HI>What am I, and what is my Fa|thers hou&s;e, that thou ha&s;t brought me hitherto?</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 7.18. It is a greater, that God is wil|ling to advance any of Mankind to heavenly glory, He puts great honour upon them there|in. But this is more, that it &s;hould be &s;aid of a Man, that He is God; that He made Heaven and Earth, that out of the Mouth of Babes and Sucklings God &s;hould ordain Strength, that He &s;hould advance a Man above Principalites and Powers, and &s;ay of him, <HI>Let all the Angels
<PB N="9" REF="001584_0010_0FB3D649D193B5C8">of God wor&s;hip Him,</HI> and &s;ay to Him, <HI>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever.</HI> It &s;eems to be too much for a Creature to be Per&s;onal|ly United to the Creator. God is angry with us when we Wor&s;hip Wood and Stone, and Silver and Gold; and it &s;eems very unlikely that God &s;hould bid us Wor&s;hip One that was made out of the du&s;t, as well as our &s;elves. The honour that God puts on many men in the World is very great, but it is amazing that God &s;hould put &s;o much honour upon a Man, that He &s;hould be Per&s;onally United to the Divine Nature: that the God of Heaven and Earth, whom all the Angels adore, &s;hould take the Son of a poor Woman, Married to a Man of mean occupation, into Per&s;onal Union with Him&s;elf.</P>
<P>PROP. II <HI>Yet many Men have &s;ome Per|&s;wa&s;ion of it, becau&s;e it is revealed by Men.</HI> There be Multitudes of Men that make a Profe&s;&s;ion of his Divinity, that are but carnal men: for they are not obedient to him: <HI>Luk.</HI> 6.46. <HI>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I &s;ay.</HI> They are zealous in the Profe&s;&s;ion of his Divinity, they Write in de|fence of it, they &s;uffer Per&s;ecution for it. If any Man among us &s;hould deny it, they would
<PB N="10" REF="001584_0011_0FB3D64B53772780">think he were not worthy to live; they have a con&s;iderable per&s;wa&s;ion of the Truth of it, but it is becau&s;e it is revealed by Man.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Becau&s;e it is acknowledged by &s;uch a Mul|titude of Men.</HI> They have imbibed this doctrine from their Childhood: and wherever they go they find others are of the &s;ame per|&s;wa&s;ion; they hear that many great Nations do receive it: Wi&s;e and Learned Men are of that per&s;wa&s;ion, and they take it for granted that it is &s;o, and dare not call the thing into que&s;tion. As the <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> were per&s;waded that the <HI>Image of Diana fell down from Heaven.</HI> And as the <HI>Turks</HI> are per&s;waded that <HI>Maho|met</HI> was a great Prophet. And as the carnal Jews were per&s;waded that God &s;pake by <HI>Mo|&s;es:</HI> &s;o the&s;e men are per&s;waded that Je&s;us is the Son of God: They think &s;urely &s;o many wi&s;e men in former Generations, and in this Generation are not deceived. They don't think it &s;trange that Ignorant Heathens &s;hould be deceived, and that the Jews that are under great Prejudices &s;hould be deceived. But they dare not harbour a thought, that &s;uch good and wi&s;e and learned Men as make this Profe&s;&s;ion &s;hould be deceived. The re&s;timo|ny of the Chri&s;tian World is of great force
<PB N="11" REF="001584_0012_0FB3D64CD51F0B20">with them, they &s;ay it is not to be imagined that &s;uch Men would agree in &s;uch a Profe&s;&s;i|on without ground. If there were but few that owned it, that would be a terrible temp|tation to them, but it would be unrea&s;onable for them to que&s;tion that which is &s;o generally acknowledged, they &s;hould render them&s;elves abominable, and be contemptible and vile in the Eyes of all about them, and make their lives mi&s;erable, if they &s;hould give way to a Scrupulous Spirit about this doctrine.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Becau&s;e there are &s;o many arguments for it in that book, which Men &s;ay is the word of God.</HI> There are many rea&s;ons drawn from the Scriptures to prove that Je&s;us was the Son of God. It was fore-told, that the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> mu&s;t come before the Scepter departed from <HI>Judah</HI> That he mu&s;t come while the Second Temple was &s;tanding; that he mu&s;t come before <HI>Da|niels</HI> Seventy Weeks were run out; and there never was any yet in the World to whom the Characters of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> did in any probabi|lity belong, but only Je&s;us of Nazereth. The Miraculous conception of Chri&s;t is a great evi|dence for him, <HI>Luk.</HI> 1.35. The Voice of God from Heaven was very evidential of His Di|vinity. The te&s;timony of <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="001584_0013_0FB3D64E51A05828">has a great deal of argument in it. The Mi|raculous works that were wrought by him, and by the Apo&s;tles in his Name, are very &s;peaking arguments. God bore witne&s;s to him by divers &s;igns and wonders &amp; miracles, and gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.4. The Re&s;urrection of Je&s;us on the third day accor|ding to his Prediction, is a great Witne&s;s for him. The rejection of the Jews &s;oon after their Crucifying him, is a &s;trong confirmation of this doctrine: The&s;e things are plainly held forth in the Scripture, and it is generally acknowledged that the Scripture is the word of God. The inlightned part of the World are generally of a mind, that the Scripture was given by in&s;piration from God. Men would count them out of their Wits, if they &s;hould not own the Scriptures to be the word of God. They think they mu&s;t yield that, not only Orthodox Churches do own it, out the very Papi&s;ts, &amp; many other Hereticks do. What-ever differences there are among <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">hen about the Explication of Scripture, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">hey generally agree about the Divine Autho|rity of it; and if that be indeed the word of God, then &s;urely Je&s;us of Nazereth is the Son of God.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="001584_0014_0FB3D64FD16C7EB8">
PROP. III. <HI>They are ble&s;&s;ed to whom this is revealed by the Father.</HI> The World doth admire the felicity of tho&s;e that are great and noble, but the&s;e Men that the Father hath re|vealed Chri&s;t unto, are indeed ble&s;&s;ed, the&s;e are objects of Gods love, the&s;e are the heirs of the Kingdom of God. Death will put a Pe|riod to the imaginary happine&s;s of &s;ome men: but if men have this revealed to them by the Father, at Death they will enter into happi|ne&s;s: for every &s;uch man doth believe on Je|&s;us Chri&s;t. Some men complain that they cannot come to Chri&s;t; but the&s;e men are able to come to Chri&s;t, and do come to Him. They do fulfill the condition of the Covenant of Grace, <HI>Job.</HI> 6.45.</P>
<P>Argu. 1. <HI>Tho&s;e to whom this is revealed by the Father, are convinced of the &s;ufficiency of his Death for Redemption.</HI> When awakned Sin|ners are invited unto Chri&s;t, they are not con|vinced of the &s;ufficiency of the blood of Chri&s;t, and they are afraid to accept of the Invitation. They con&s;ider that their Sins have been very great, and God is an Holy and a Jealous God: That he hath threatned ever|la&s;ting de&s;truction for Sin, and that the &s;uffe|rings
<PB N="14" REF="001584_0015_0FB3D65154779BD8">of Je&s;us Chri&s;t were but for a few years, and the extremity of them for a few hours; and don't &s;ee the redeeming virtue of his blood. They could as quietly depend upon the Sacrifices of <HI>Sheep</HI> and <HI>Oxen,</HI> as the Sacri|fice of CHRIST: They can take more in|couragement from the Tears that they &s;hed, than the blood that Chri&s;t has &s;hed. But when they are taught of the Father the Divi|nity of Chri&s;t, they are convinced of the &s;uffi|ciency of his Death: when the Father doth teach them the Divinity of Chri&s;t, then they do indeed &s;ee his Divine Glory; than they &s;ay, <HI>God has purcha&s;ed his Church with his own blood,</HI> Act. 20.28. Then they &s;ay, <HI>The blood of Chri&s;t who through the Eternal Spirit offered him&s;elf without &s;pot to God, doth purge the Con|&s;cience from dead works,</HI> Heb. 9.14. They have &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the dignity of his Per&s;on, that they are &s;atisfied that his &s;ufferings are a &s;uffi|cient price of Redemption. That though his &s;ufferings were but for a little time, yet they abundantly an&s;wer for tho&s;e Eternal Puni&s;h|ments that they have de&s;erved. That God has received a full recompence for the wrongs which they have done him: now they cannot count the blood of the Covenant a common
<PB N="15" REF="001584_0016_0FB3D652EC362168">thing. They &s;ay, <HI>Chri&s;t hath redeemed us from the cur&s;e, being made a cur&s;e for us.</HI> Gal. 3.13. They can have no low thoughts of the Sacrifice of Chri&s;t; they &s;ay it was the Mighty God that Suffered, He who&s;e goings forth have been from Everla&s;ting, He who&s;e Glory fills Heaven and Earth, He who is the bright|ne&s;s of his Fathers Glory, and the expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on.</P>

<P>Two things make this Examination diffi|cult.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Some men that have not been taught by the Father, have had great illuminations</HI> Some men have been &s;atisfied at the time that the

The light that others have is like that at noon day: The light that &s;ome men have is very clear, things are made exceeding evident to them. The light is more explicite and di&s;tinct than in others; they have a larger and fuller di&s;|covery of the Glory of Chri&s;t: yea the light that &s;ome have is more frequently repeated: They have many times had di&s;coveries of Chri&s;t: And the&s;e men that have but a &s;mall degree of light, are under great di&s;advantage, becau&s;e the light is &s;mall, they cannot give &s;o di&s;tinct account of what they &s;ee; it is not &s;o ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h that light from common light; and be&s;ides they are under great temp|tation to &s;u&s;pect the revelation that is made to them. They hear other Chri&s;tians &s;peak|ing of their experiences, and they tell what di&s;coveries they had, and with what wonder|ful comfort and joy their hearts were filled: and this proves a great exerci&s;e to them.

1. <HI>Such as have been taught by the Father, have &s;een them&s;elves utterly blind, ju&s;t before that revelation.</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the World, that they which &s;ee not might &s;ee, <HI>Joh.</HI> 19.39. Every man is blind by Nature, and he &s;hews them this blindne&s;s ju&s;t before he puts this light into them. Some men &s;ay, They were never at any lo&s;s about the divini|ty of Je&s;us of Nazareth, they always believed it; they may be a&s;&s;ured that it hath never been revealed to them by the Father. Some others &s;ay, They have many times &s;een their blindne&s;s; truly there be partial convictions of it very frequently, and yet men remain blind. But it is the manner of God ju&s;t before he lets in this heavenly light, to make a tho|rough di&s;covery of this natural blindne&s;s, then he gives light to them that &s;at in darkne&s;s, <HI>Luk.</HI> 1.7, 9. He dont convince men of their blindne&s;s a Twelve month before, and &s;uffer them to loo&s;e the &s;en&s;e of it, and then reveal Chri&s;t to them: but he makes them &s;en&s;ible that they are in Egyptian darkne&s;s, that no teaching, nor arguing, nor con&s;ideration is &s;ufficient to inlighten them, and in this ex|tremity God makes the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s to ari&s;e on them: and they are delivered out
<PB N="25" REF="001584_0026_0FB3D663AB4141E8">of the Kingdom of darkne&s;s, and tran&s;lated into the Kingdom of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They &s;ee God te&s;tifying to the Divinity of Chri&s;t, in the Old Te&s;tament.</HI> There be &s;everal characters of the Me&s;&s;iah that are applicable to none but Je&s;us of Nazareth; and in the New Te&s;tament it is plainly laid down, that Je&s;us is the Son of God. The&s;e men have read them hundreds of times, and had a com|mon per&s;wa&s;ion of them; but now they &s;ee God te&s;tifying to them, their under&s;tandings are inlightned to &s;ee &s;uch a glory in the Go&s;|pel, that they know it to be the word of God. It can be no other than the word of God. The declaration of the Go&s;pel comes with a divine authority upon them; they hear the Voice of God in the Go&s;pel: the word is not an uncertain report, but there goes a glorious light along with it: They dont look upon it to be an imagination, or a conjecture, but the true &s;ayings of God. They are not in the dark about it, whether the Go&s;pel be a cunningly devi&s;ed fable, and an humane invention. They are not of a doubtful Mind, but they plainly &s;ee a divine &s;ignature, and the character of divine authority in it. They &s;ee in it the ma|nife&s;tation of the Grace and Wi&s;dom, and
<PB N="26" REF="001584_0027_0FB3D664D14EADE8">Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God. 1 The&s;. 2.13. <HI>Ye re|ceived it not as the word of man, but as it is in|deed the word of God, which worketh effectually in them that believe.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They do at the &s;ame time &s;ee all other things that are nece&s;&s;ary, in order to their coming to Chri&s;t.</HI> In order to mens coming to Chri&s;t, they mu&s;t &s;ee many other things, they mu&s;t &s;ee that Je&s;us is appointed by God to be a Mediator, that he has born the Puni&s;hment of our iniquities: That there is Saving virtue in his blood and righteou&s;ne&s;s, that the Mercy of God is free, that they are invited by God, that God is faithful to fulfill his Pro|mi&s;e in the Go&s;pel. And when the divinity of Chri&s;t is revealed by the Father, they &s;ee all the&s;e things. If all impediments were not removed out of the way, they would not dare to come to Chri&s;t. Indeed the Soul in its fir&s;t coming to Chri&s;t hath not the particular di&s;tinct con&s;ideration of all tho&s;e things; for the work is wrought at once, as it were in the twinkling of an eye, but there is that light let into the Soul, that a man &s;ees abundant incouragement to ca&s;t his Soul upon Chri&s;t; and is &s;atisfied in the truth of that Evangelical doctrine, that he has been in&s;tructed in: He
<PB N="27" REF="001584_0028_0FB3D66651C2D830">&s;ayes, as Joh. 6.68. <HI>Whether &s;hall we go? thou ha&s;t the words of Eternal Life.</HI> And if any thing be &s;ugge&s;ted to him about the freene&s;s of Gods Mercy, about the fidelity of God, a|bout the univer&s;ality of the Go&s;pel call, he is prepared to a&s;&s;ent to the&s;e things. The word of Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t is cleared up &s;o unto him, that all ob&s;ticles are taken out of the way, and he can with freedom of Spirit imbrace the call of the Go&s;pel, and joyfully betake him&s;elf to Chri&s;t for refuge.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>This revelation doth immediately made a Spiritual change in the Soul.</HI> Some of the&s;e men long before the revelation was made to them, carried it orderly, were religiou&s;ly di&s;|po&s;ed, were zealous again&s;t Sinful ways, had an affection for the People of God, were &s;orry for their Sins, &s;trove to do duties for the glory of God, were very watchful again&s;t temptations, &s;ometimes had great inlarge|ments and meltings in Prayer. But upon this revelation, they have quite another Spirit than they had: Now they love God, God has their hearts: they de&s;ire the glory of God. They &s;ay with <HI>Paul, Now to the King Eternal, Immortal, Invi&s;ible, and only wi&s;e God, be ho|nour and glory for ever and ever,</HI> 1 Tim. 1.17.
<PB N="18" REF="001584_0029_0FB3D667D13AC058">Now they have godly &s;orrow for their Sins; this di&s;covery works a &s;pirit of Repentance in them; and they &s;ay as <HI>Job,</HI> Now we <HI>abhor our &s;elves, and repent in du&s;t and a&s;hes,</HI> Job 42.6. This di&s;covery puts life into them. <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.25. <HI>They hear the Voice of the Son of God and live.</HI> And though the old Spirit doth return again, and gather &s;trength, and &s;ome|times much prevail, yet the tokens of this change do abide in them: <HI>The &s;pirit is lu&s;ting again&s;t the fle&s;h,</HI> Gal. 5.17. And they have a continual warfare; and many times there be &s;en&s;ible workings of a Spirit of Grace, they are rejoycing in Chri&s;t, panting after God, hungring and thir&s;ting after righteou&s;ne&s;s, loving tho&s;e that are godly, longing for the inlargement of Chri&s;ts Kingdom, waiting for the breathings of the Spirit, hating all the works of darkne&s;s.</P>
