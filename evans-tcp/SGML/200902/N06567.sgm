<P>_NOTHING can be more agree|able to the God of Peace, than to &s;ee univer&s;al Harmony and Benevolence prevail among his Creatures: and He has laid them under the &s;tronge&s;t Ob|ligations to cultivate a pacific Temper towards one another, both as <HI>Individuals,</HI> and as <HI>Na|tions. "Follow Peace with all Men,"</HI> is one of the principal Precepts of our holy Religi|on. And the great Prince of Peace has &s;o|lemnly pronounced, <HI>"Ble&s;&s;ed are the Peace|makers."</HI></P>
<P>But when, in this corrupt di&s;ordered State of Things, where the Lu&s;ts of Men are per|petually embroiling the World with Wars and Fightings, and throwing all into Confu|&s;ion; when Ambition and Avarice would rob us of our Property, for which we have toil|ed, and on which we &s;ub&s;i&s;t; when they would en&s;lave the free-born Mind, and com|pel us meanly to cringe to U&s;urpation and Arbitrary Power; when they would tear

from our eager Gra&s;p the mo&s;t valuable Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, I mean our RELIGION: when they invade our Country, formerly the Region of Tranquility, ravage our Frontiers, butcher our Fellow-Subjects, or confine them in a barbarous Captivity in the Dens of Sa|vages; when our <HI>earthly</HI> All is ready to be &s;eized by rapacious Hands, and even our <HI>Eternal</HI> All is in Danger by the Lo&s;s of our Religion: when this is the Ca&s;e, what is then the Will of God?

Is the Work of Peace then our only Bu&s;ine&s;s? No; in &s;uch a Time even the God of Peace proclaims by his Pro|vidence, "To ARMS!" Then the <HI>Sword</HI> is, as it were, <HI>con&s;ecrated</HI> to God; and the Art of WAR becomes a Part of our <HI>Religion.</HI> Then happy is he that &s;hall reward our Ene|mies, as they have &s;erved us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;. cxxxxii 8.</NOTE>. Ble&s;&s;ed is the brave Soldier: ble&s;&s;ed is the Defender of his Country, and the De&s;troyer of its Enemies. Ble&s;&s;ed are they who offer them&s;elves will|ingly in this Service, and who faithfully di&s;|charge it. But on the other Hand,
<Q>Cur&s;ed is he that doth the Work of the Lord de|ceitfully;
<PB N="5" REF="008336_0009_102F32B868498D88">
and cur&s;ed is he that keepeth back his Sword from Blood.</Q></P>
<P>As to the original Reference and Meaning of the&s;e Words, it is &s;ufficient to my Purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve, That the <HI>Moabites,</HI> again&s;t whom this Prophecy was immediately denounced, were a trouble&s;ome and re&s;tle&s;s Nation in the Ne&icirc;ghbourhood of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who, though often &s;ubdued by them, as <HI>France</HI> has been by <HI>England,</HI> yet upon every Occa&s;ion &s;trug|gled to recover their Power, and renewed their Ho&s;tilities. By this, and various other Steps, they were arrived to the highe&s;t Pitch of national Guilt, and ripe for Execution. The <HI>Babylonians</HI> were commi&s;&s;ioned for this Work of Vengeance: and they were bound to execute the Commi&s;&s;ion fatihfully, under Penalty of a Cur&s;e. To them this Denun|ciation was immediately directed,
<Q>Cur&s;ed be he that doth the Work of the Lord de|ceitfully [or negligently]; and cur&s;ed be he that keepeth back his Sword from Blood.</Q>
This is expre&s;&s;ed in the Form of an <HI>Imprecation,</HI> or an authoritative Denunci|ation of a Cur&s;e: And in this Form, it might be u&s;ed, con&s;i&s;tently with Benevolence, by a Prophet &s;peaking as the Mouth of God. But this is not a Pattern for our Imitation, who are peculiarly obliged under the Go&s;pel to <HI>"Ble&s;s, and cur&s;e not,"</HI> and to "pray for all Men."
However, it may be pronoun|ced
<PB N="6" REF="008336_0010_102F32BAF9C9DE78">
even by our Lips as a <HI>Declaration</HI> of the righteous Cur&s;e of God again&s;t a da&s;tardly Refu&s;al to engage in War, when it is our Duty; or a deceitful negligent Di&s;charge of that Duty, after we have engaged in it. The&s;e are the Crimes that &s;eem intended in my Text: and again&s;t each of the&s;e the tre|mendous Cur&s;e of JEHOVAH is &s;till in full Force in all Ages, even under the mild and gentle Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel. Cowar|dice and Treachery are now as execrable as ever.</P>
<P><Q>Cur&s;ed be he that keepeth back his Sword from Blood.</Q>
&mdash;This Denunciation, like the Artillery of Heaven, is leveled again&s;t the mean, &s;neaking Coward, who, when God, in the Cour&s;e of his Providence, calls him to Arms, refu&s;es to obey, and con&s;ults his own Ea&s;e and Safety, more than his Duty to God and his Country.</P>
<P><Q>Cur&s;ed be he that doth the Work of the Lord deceitfully.</Q>
&mdash;This &s;eems to be le|velled again&s;t another Species of Cowards; fly, hypocritical Cowards, who undertake the Work of the Lord, that is, take up Arms; but they do the Work of the Lord <HI>deceitful|ly,</HI> that is, they do not faithfully u&s;e their Arms for the Purpo&s;es they were taken up. They commence Soldiers, not that they may &s;erve their Country, and do their Duty to God, but that they may live in Ea&s;e, Idlene&s;s

<P>You Gentlemen and others, whom I this Day behold with peculiar Plea&s;ure engaged in the Cau&s;e of your neglected Country, and who have done me the Honour of inviting me to this Service; a Service, which I am &s;ure I &s;hould perform to your Satisfaction, if my Preparations and Abilities were propor|tioned to my Benevolence for you, and my Concern for your Succe&s;s: <HI>You</HI> are peculiarly intere&s;ted in the Remarks I have made upon the Text. And that I may contribute all in my Power both to increa&s;e your Number, and direct you to a proper Conduct in the honourable Character you &s;u&s;tain, I &s;hall lay before you a brief View of the pre&s;ent Cir|cum&s;tances of our Country, from which it will appear, that the War in which we are engaged is a Duty, or THE WORK OF THE LORD; and con&s;equently, that we are all obliged, according to our re&s;pective Characters, to carry it on with Vigour, under Penalty of falling under the Cur&s;e of God. And then I I &s;hall &s;hew you what is the deceitful Per|formance of the Lord's Work, or un&s;ea&s;ona|bly keeping back of the Sword from Blood, which expo&s;es to the Cur&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to lay before you a brief View of
<PB N="8" REF="008336_0012_102F32C22C033A28">
the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of our Country, which render the War in which we are en|gaged the Work of the Lord, which con&s;e|crate Swords as In&s;truments of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and call us to the dreadful, but important Duty of &s;hedding human Blood, upon Pe|nalty of falling under the tremendous Cur&s;e of God.</P>
<P>Need I inform you what Barbarities and Depredations a mongrel Race of <HI>Indian Sa|vages</HI> and <HI>French Papi&s;ts</HI> have perpetrated upon our Frontiers? How many de&s;erted or demoli&s;hed Hou&s;es and Plantations! How wide an Extent of Country abandoned! How many poor Families obliged to fly in Con&s;ter|nation, and leave their All behind them! What Breaches and Separations between the neare&s;t Relations! What painful Ruptures of Heart from Heart! What &s;hocking Di&s;|per&s;ions of tho&s;e once united by the &s;tron|ge&s;t and mo&s;t endearing Ties! Some lie dead, mangled with &s;avage Wounds, con&s;umed to A&s;hes with outrageous Flames, or torn and devoured by the Bea&s;ts of the Wilderne&s;s, while their Bones lie whitening in the Sun, and &s;erve as tragical Memorials of the fatal Spot where they fell. Others have been dragged away Captives, and made the Slaves of imperious and cruel Savages. Others have made their E&s;cape, and live to lament their butchered or captivated Friends and Rela|tions.
<PB N="9" REF="008336_0013_102F32C40B353B70">
In &s;hort, our Frontiers have been drenched with the Blood of our Fellow-Sub|jects, through the Length of a thou&s;and Miles: and new Wounds are &s;till opening. We, in the&s;e inland Parts of the Country, are as yet unmole&s;ted, through the immerited Mercy of Heaven. But let us glance a Thought to the We&s;tern Extremities of our Body Politick; and what melancholy Scenes open to our View! Now, perhaps, while I am &s;peaking; now while you are &s;ecure and unmole&s;ted, our Fellow-Subjects there may be feeling the Calamities I am de&s;cribing. Now, perhaps the &s;avage Shouts and Whoops of Indians, and the Screams and Groans of &s;ome butchered Family, may be mingling their Horrors, and circulating their horren|dous Echoes thro' the Wilderne&s;s of Rocks and Mountains. Now, perhaps &s;ome tender delicate Creature may be &s;uffering and invo|luntary Pro&s;titution to &s;avage Lu&s;t; and per|haps debauched and murdered by the &s;ame Hand. Now, perhaps, &s;ome mi&s;erable Briton or Virginian may be pa&s;&s;ing through a tedious Proce&s;s of Experiments in the infernal Art of Torture. Now &s;ome helple&s;s Children may be torn from the Arms of their murdered Parents, and dragged away weeping and wringing their Hands, to receive their Edu|cation among Barbarians, and to be formed upon the Model of a ferocius <HI>Indian</HI> Soul.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="008336_0014_102F32C742978360">And will the&s;e Violences cea&s;e without a vigorous and timely Re&s;i&s;tance from us? Can <HI>Indian</HI> Revenge and Thir&s;t for Blood be gluted? or can <HI>French</HI> Ambition and Avarice be &s;atisfied? No, we have no Method left, but to repel Force with Force, and to give them Blood to drink in their Turn, who have drunk ours. If we &s;it &s;till and do nothing, or content our&s;elves, as alas we have hither|to, with feeble, dilatory Efforts, we may ex|pect the&s;e Barbarities will not only continue, but that the Indians, headed by the French, tho&s;e eternal Enemies of Peace, Liberty and Britons, will carry their Inroads &s;till farther into the Country, and reach even to us. By the De&s;ertion of our remote Settlements, the Frontiers are approaching every Day nearer and nearer to us: and if we cannot &s;tand our Ground now, when we have above an hun|dred Miles of a thick-&s;ettled Country be|tween us and the Enemy, much le&s;s &s;hall we be able, when our Strength is weakened by &s;o va&s;t a Lo&s;s of Men, Arms and Riches, and we lie expo&s;ed to their immediate Incur&s;ions. Some cry,
<Q>Let the Enemy come down to us, and then we will fight them.</Q>
But this is the trifling Excu&s;e of Cowardice or Security, and not the Language of Prudence and Fortitude. Tho&s;e who make this Plea, if the Enemy &s;hould take them at their Word, and make them &s;o near a Vi&s;it, would be as
<PB N="11" REF="008336_0015_102F32C9A692DCD8">
forward in Flight, as they are now backward to take up Arms.</P>
<P>Such, my Brethren, &s;uch, alas! is the pre|&s;ent State of our Country: it bleeds in a thou&s;and Veins; and without a timely Re|medy, the Wound will prove mortal. And in &s;uch Circum&s;tances, is it not our Duty in the Sight of God, is it not a Work to which the Lord loudly calls us, to take up Arms for the Defence of our Country? Certainly it is: and "cur&s;ed is he," who having no Ties &s;ufficiently &s;trong to confine him at Home, "keepeth his Sword from Blood." The mean, &s;neaking Wretch, that can de&s;ert the Cau&s;e of his Country in &s;uch an Exigen|cy; his Country, in the Ble&s;&s;ings of which he &s;hared, while in Peace and Pro&s;perity; and which is therefore intitled to his Sympa|thy and A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Day of its Di&s;tre&s;s; that cowardly ungrateful Wretch &s;ins again&s;t God and his Country, and de&s;erves the Cur&s;e of both. Such a Conduct in &s;uch a Con|juncture, is a <HI>moral Evil,</HI> a gro&s;s Wicked|ne&s;s; and expo&s;es the Wretch to the heavy Cur&s;e of God both in this and the eternal World.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but ob&s;erve, that among the various and numberle&s;s Sins under which our Country groans, and which mu&s;t be looked upon as the Cau&s;es of our public Ca|lamities, by every one that believes a divine

Providence; (a Doctrine &s;o comfortable, and &s;o e&s;&s;ential both in Natural and Revealed Re|ligion! an Article in the Creed of Heathens and Mahometans, as well as Jews and Chri&s;|tians;) I &s;ay among the&s;e various Sins, Cow|ardice and Security are none of the lea&s;t. He that hath determined the Bounds of our Habitation, hath planted us in a Land of Li|berty and Plenty; a Land, till lately, un|alarmed with the Terrors of War, and un|&s;tained with human Blood: Indeed, all Things con&s;idered, there are but few &s;uch happy Spots upon our Globe. And mu&s;t it not highly provoke our divine Benefactor, to &s;ee a People thus di&s;tingui&s;hed with Ble&s;&s;ings, &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of their Worth, &s;o ungrateful for them, and &s;o unacquainted with their own Unworthine&s;s to receive them? What can be more evidential of their undue Apprehen|&s;ions of the Worth of the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, than their being &s;o little concerned to &s;ecure and recover them? The Generality among us have acted, as if their Intere&s;ts at Stake were &s;o trifling, that it would not be worth while to take Pains, or encounter Dangers, to pre|&s;erve them. What greater Evidence can be given of Ingratitude, than a &s;upine Neglect of the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;uch a &s;tupidly tame and irre&s;i&s;ting Re&s;ignation of them into bloo|dy and rapacious Hands?

our Unworthine&s;s of &s;uch Ble&s;&s;ings, than our being &s;o inapprehen&s;ive of lo&s;ing them, even in the mo&s;t threatening and dangerous Cir|cum&s;tances? Our Countrymen in general have acted, as if Beings of their Importance and Merit might certainly re&s;t in the quiet unmole&s;ted Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Liberty and Property, without any one daring to di&s;turb them, and without their doing any Thing for their own Defence: or as if neither God nor Man could &s;trip them of their Enjoy|ments. What vain &s;elf-confident Pre&s;ump|tion, what intolerable In&s;olence is this, in a &s;inful Nation, a People laden with Iniquity, who have forfeited every Ble&s;&s;ing, even the Ground they tread upon, and the Air they breathe in; and who live meerly by the im|merited Grace, and Bounty of God? Is not Cowardice and Security, or an Unwillingne&s;s to engage with all our Might in the Defence of our Country, in &s;uch a Situation, an enor|mous <HI>Wickedne&s;s</HI> in the Sight of God, and worthy of his Cur&s;e, as well as a &s;candalous da&s;tardly <HI>Meanne&s;s</HI> in the Sight of Men, and worthy of public Shame and Indignation? Is it not fit, that tho&s;e who &s;o contemptuou&s;ly depreciate the rich and unde&s;erved Bounties of Heaven, and who &s;well &s;o in&s;olently with a vain Conceit of their own Importance and Worth, &s;hould be puni&s;hed with the Lo&s;s of the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings?

Courage, and every heroic Virtue, to fire you into Patriots and Soldiers this Moment!&mdash;Ye young and hardy Men, who&s;e very Faces &s;eem to &s;peak that God and Nature formed you for Soldiers, who are free from the In|cumbrance of Families depending upon you for Sub&s;i&s;tence, and who are perhaps but of little Service to Society, while at Home, may I not &s;peak for you, and declare as your Mouth,
<Q>Here we are, all ready to abandon our Ea&s;e, and ru&s;h into the glorious Dan|gers of the Field, in Defence of our Coun|try?</Q>
Ye that love your Country, enli&s;t: for Honour will follow you in Life or Death in &s;uch a Cau&s;e. You that love your Reli|gion enli&s;t: for your Religion is in Danger.

Ye that love your Friends and Relations, enli&s;t; le&s;t ye &s;ee them en&s;la|ved or butchered before your Eyes. Ye that would catch at Money, here is a proper Bait for you; ten Pounds for a few Months Ser|vice, be&s;ides the u&s;ual Pay of Soldiers. I &s;e|riou&s;ly make the Propo&s;al to you, not only as a Subject of the be&s;t of Kings, and a Friend to your Country, but as <HI>a Servant of the mo&s;t High God:</HI> for I am fully per&s;waded what I am recommending, is his Will; and Di&s;o|bedience to it may expo&s;e you to his Cur&s;e.</P>

<Q>that you are dragged away like Slaves again&s;t your Wills, while others are without Rea&s;on exempted:</Q>
for now it is left to your own Honour, and you may act as free Men. Nor can you object,
<Q>that you are arbitrarily thru&s;t under the Command of foreign, unknown, or di&s;agreeable Offi|cers:</Q>
for the Gentleman that has the im|mediate Command of this Company, and his &s;ubordinate Officers, are of your&s;elves, your Neighbours Children, and perhaps your old Companions.

empty Excu&s;e: and I wi&s;h I could remove it, by giving you a univer&s;al A&s;&s;urance, that the Army is a School of Religion; and that Soldiers, as they are more expo&s;ed to Death than other Men, are proportionably better prepared for it than others. But alas! the Rever&s;e of this is too true; and the Conta|gion of Vice and Irreligion is perhaps no where &s;tronger than in the Army; where, one would think, the &s;upreme Tribunal &s;hould be always in View, and it &s;hould be their chief Care to prepare for Eternity, on the &s;lippery Brink of which they &s;tand every Mo|ment. But, GENTLEMEN-OFFICERS, I mu&s;t again appeal to you, that as for this Compa|ny, you will not willingly allow any Form of Vice to be practi&s;ed in it with Impunity; but will always endeavour to recommend and en|force Religion and good Morals by your Ex|ample and Authority, and to &s;uppre&s;s the con|trary? May I not give the Public the Satis|faction of &s;uch an A&s;&s;urance concerning you, that whatever others do, as for you and your Company you will &s;erve the Lord? Do you not own your&s;elves bound to this in Honour and Duty? Such a Conduct I can a&s;&s;ure you, will render you popular among the Wi&s;e and Good; tho' perhaps it may expo&s;e you to the &s;en&s;ele&s;s Contempt of Fools, who <HI>make a Mock of Sin,</HI> and who e&s;teem it Bravery to in&s;ult that God <HI>in who&s;e Hand their Breath is,

Such a Conduct will be a Source of true Courage, and render you nobly indifferent about Life or Death in a good Cau&s;e. And let me hone&s;tly warn you, that if you do not maintain &s;uch a Conduct, you will bitterly repent it either in Time, or Eternity.</P>
<P>But I return to invite others to join with you in this important Expedition.&mdash;What a Crowd of important Arguments pre&s;s you on every Hand? What can our Legi&s;lature do more, than they have done to engage you?

Shall not So|briety, public Spirit, Courage, Fidelity, and good Di&s;cipline be maintained among you? This I humbly recommend to you; and may God enable you to act accordingly!</P>

<P>None of you I hope will reply,
<Q>I am now a Soldier, and have nothing more to do with Religion?</Q>
What! has a Soldier Nothing to do with Religion? Is a Soldier under no Obligations to the God that made him, and that furni&s;hes him with every Ble&s;&s;|ing? Is not a Soldier as much expo&s;ed to Death as other Men? May not a Soldier be damned for Sin, as well as other Sinners? And will he be able to dwell with devouring Fire and everla&s;ting Burnings? Are the&s;e Things &s;o? Can any of you be &s;o &s;tupid as to think them &s;o? If not, you mu&s;t own, that even a <HI>Soldier</HI> has as much Concern with Religion, as another. Therefore hear me &s;eriou&s;ly upon this Head.</P>
<P>You are about entering into <HI>the School of Vice:</HI> for &s;uch the Army has generally been. And are any of you already initiated into any

of the My&s;teries of Iniquity there practi&s;ed? Mu&s;t I &s;o much as &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ome of you, who have bravely e&s;pou&s;ed the Cau&s;e of your Country, are addicted to Drunkenne&s;s, Swear|ing, Whoredom, or any gro&s;s Vice? I can|not now take Time to rea&s;on with you for your Conviction: it may &s;uffice to appeal to your own Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience, Do you do well in indulging the&s;e Vices? Will you ap|prove of it in the hone&s;t Hour of Death? Will this Conduct prove a Source of Courage to you, when the Arrows of Death are fly|ing thick around you, and Scores are falling on every Side? No, you are &s;elf-condemned; and may I not rea&s;onably hope, you will en|deavour to reform, what you cannot but con|demn? Soldiers indeed, are too commonly addicted to &s;uch Immoralities: but are they the better Soldiers on that Account? Can an Oath or a Debauch in&s;pire them with a ra|tional Fortitude again&s;t the Fears of Death? Would not Prayer and a Life of Holine&s;s better an&s;wer this Purpo&s;e? Their Courage, if they have any, mu&s;t be the Effect, not of Thought, but of the <HI>Want</HI> of Thought; it mu&s;t be a brutal Stupidity, or Ferocity; but not the rational Courage of a Man or a Chri&s;|tian.</P>
<P>Some of you, I doubt not, are happily free from the&s;e gro&s;s Vices: and long may you continue &s;o! but I mu&s;t tell you, this <HI>nega|tive</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="008336_0030_102F32EEFB1D06B0">
Goodne&s;s is not enough to prepare you for Death, or to con&s;titute you true Chri&s;ti|ans. The Temper of your Minds mu&s;t be changed by the Power of divine Grace; and you mu&s;t be turned from the Love and Prac|tice of all Sin, to the Love and Practice of univer&s;al Holine&s;s. You mu&s;t become hum|ble, broken-hearted Penitents, and true Be|lievers in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> You mu&s;t be enabled to live righteou&s;ly, &s;oberly, and godly, in this pre&s;ent evil World.

<P>But are not &s;ome of you con&s;cious, that you are de&s;titude of &s;uch a Religion as this? Then it is high Time for you to think on your Condition in &s;ober Sadne&s;s. Pray to that powerful and gracious Being, who can form your Hearts and Lives after this &s;acred Model.

of Heaven; and you have little Rea&s;on to hope, you will ever improve it as a Space for Repentance.&mdash;Remember al&s;o to put your Confidence in God; who keeps the Thread of your Life, and the Event of War, in his own Hand. Devoutly acknowledge his Pro|vidence in all your Ways, and be &s;en&s;ible of your Dependance upon it.</P>
<P>And now, to conclude my Addre&s;s to you, as the Mouth of this Multitude, and of your Countrymen in general, I heartily bid you farewel. Farewel, my dear Friends, my brave Fellow-Subjects, the Guardians of your poor ravaged Country. God grant you may re|turn in Safety and Honour, and that we may yet welcome you Home, crowned with Lau|rels of Victory! Or if any of you &s;hould lo&s;e your Lives in &s;o good a Cau&s;e, may you enjoy a glorious and ble&s;&s;ed Immortality in the Re|gion of everla&s;ting Peace and Tranquility! Methinks I may take upon me to promi&s;e you the Prayers and good Wi&s;hes of Thou&s;ands. Thou&s;ands, whom you leave behind, will think of you with affectionate Anxiety, will wi&s;h you Succe&s;s, and congratulate your Re|turn, or lament your Death. Once more I pour out all my Heart in another affectionate Farewel. May the Lord pre&s;erve your Go|ing out, and your Coming in, from this Time forth and even for evermore. Amen.</P>
<P>Here I thought to have concluded. But

I mu&s;t take up a few Minutes more to a&s;k this Crowd, Is there Nothing to be done by us who &s;tay at Home, towards the Defence of our Country, and to promote the Succe&s;s of the Expedition now in Hand? Shall we &s;in on &s;till impenitent and incorrigible? Shall we live as if we and our Country were <HI>&s;elf-depen|dent</HI> and had nothing to do with the Supreme Ruler of the Univer&s;e?

The Cau&s;e in which the&s;e brave Men, and our Army in general, are en|gaged, is not &s;o much their own as <HI>ours:</HI> Divine Providence con&s;iders them not &s;o much in their <HI>private per&s;onal</HI> Character, as in their <HI>public</HI> Character, as the <HI>Repre&s;enta|tives,</HI> and Guardians of their Country: and therefore they will &s;tand or fall, not &s;o much according to their own <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Character, as according to the <HI>public</HI> Character of the Peo|ple, who&s;e Cau&s;e they have undertaken. Be it known to you, then, their Succe&s;s depends upon <HI>us,</HI> even more than upon them&s;elves. Therefore let us all turn every one from his evil Ways.
<Q>Let the Wicked for&s;ake his Way, &amp;c.</Q>
Let us humble our&s;elves un|der the mighty Hand of God, which is lifted up over our guilty Heads, that we may be exalted in due Time. I could venture the Reputation of my Judgment and Veracity,
<PB N="29" REF="008336_0033_102F32F5C3D16AC0">
that it will never be well with our Country, 'til there be more of the Fear and Love of God in it, and 'til the Name of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> be of more Importance among us.
