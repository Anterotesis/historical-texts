<HEAD TYPE="sub">Between his Britanic Maje&s;ty and the United States of America.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Britanic Maje&s;ty, and the United States of A|merica, being de&s;irous, by a Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, to terminate their differen|ces in &s;uch a manner, as, without reference to the me|rits of their re&s;pective complaints and pretentions, may be the be&s;t calculated to produce mutual &s;atisfaction and good under&s;tanding: And al&s;o to regulate the Com|merce and Navigation between their re&s;pective Coun|tries, Territories and People, in &s;uch a manner as to render the &s;ame reciprocally beneficial and &s;atisfactory; they have re&s;pectively named their Plenipotentiaries, and given them full powers to treat of, and conclude the &s;aid Treaty: that is to &s;ay: His Britannic Maje&s;ty has named for his Plenipotentiary, the Right Hon. William Wyndham Baron Grenville, of Wotton, one of his Maje&s;ty's privy council, and his Maje&s;ty's principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; and the Pre&s;i|dent of the United States, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate thereof, have appointed for their Plenipotentiary, the Hon. John Jay, Chief Ju&s;tice of the &s;aid United States, and their Envoy Extraordinary to his Maje&s;ty, who have agreed on and concluded the fol|lowing articles:</P>
<P>ARTICLE I. There &s;hall be a firm, inviolable and uni|ver&s;al peace, and a true and &s;incere friend&s;hip, between his Britanic Maje&s;ty, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and the
<PB REF="029747_0003_0FE2511255A01260">
United States of America; and between their re&s;pec|tive countries, territories, cities, towns and people of every degree, without exception of per&s;ons or places.</P>
<P>ART. II. His Maje&s;ty will withdraw all his troops and garri&s;ons from all po&s;ts and places within the boundary lines, a&s;&s;igned by the treaty of peace to the United States. This evacuation &s;hall take place on or before the fir&s;t day of June one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety-&s;ix, and all the proper mea&s;ures &s;hall in the in|terval be taken by concert between the government of the United States, and his Maje&s;ty's Governor General in America, for &s;ettling the previous arrangemnets which may be nece&s;&s;ary re&s;pecting the delivery of the &s;aid po&s;ts: The United States in the mean time at their di&s;|cretion, extending their &s;ettlements to any part within the &s;aid boundary line, except within the precincts or ju|ri&s;diction of any of the &s;aid po&s;ts. All &s;ettlers and tra|ders, within the precincts or juri&s;diction of the &s;aid po&s;ts &s;hall continue to enjoy, unmole&s;ted, all their property of every kind, and &s;hall be protected therein. They &s;hall be at full liberty to remain there, or to remove with all or any part of their effects; and it &s;hall al&s;o be free to them to &s;ell their lands, hou&s;es, or effects, or to retain the property thereof, at their di&s;cretion; &s;uch of them as &s;hall continue to re&s;ide within the &s;aid bounda|ry lines &s;hall not be compelled to become citizens of the United States, or to take any oath of allegiance to the government thereof, but they &s;hall be at full li|berty &s;o to do, if they think proper, and they &s;hall make and declare their election within one year after the eva|cuation afore&s;aid. And all per&s;ons who &s;hall continue there after the expiration of the &s;aid year, without hav|ing declared their intention of remaining &s;ubjects of his Britanic Maje&s;ty, &s;hall be con&s;idered as having elected to become citizens of the United States.</P>
<P>ART. III. It is agreed that it &s;hall at all times be free for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and to the citizens of the Unit|ed
<PB N="5" REF="029747_0004_0FE2515195B9DBF0">
States, and al&s;o to the Indians dwelling on either &s;ide of the &s;aid boundary line, freely to pa&s;s and repa&s;s by land or inland navigation, into the re&s;pective territo|ries and countries of the two parties on the continent of America [the country within the limits of the Hud&s;on's Bay Company only excepted] and to navigate all the Lakes, Rivers, and Waters thereof, and freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other. But it is un|der&s;tood, that this article does not extend to the admi&s;|&s;ion of ve&s;&s;els of the United States into the Sea Ports, Harbours, Bays, or Creeks of his Maje&s;ty's &s;aid territo|ries as are between the mouth thereof, and the highe&s;t port of entry from the Sea, except in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els trading bona fide between Montreal and Quebec, under &s;uch regulations as &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of any frauds in this re&s;pect. Nor, to the ad|mi&s;&s;ion of Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els from the Sea into the Rivers of the United States, beyond the highe&s;t ports of entry for foreign ve&s;&s;els from the Sea. The River Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi &s;hall however, according to the Treaty of Peace, be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports and places on its Ea&s;tern &s;ide, to which&s;oever of the parties belonging, may freely be re&s;orted to, and u&s;ed by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places of the United States, or any of the ports or places of his Maje&s;ty in Great Britain.</P>
<P>All goods and merchandize who&s;e importation into his Maje&s;ty's &s;aid territories in America, &s;hall not be entirely prohibited, may freely, for the purpo&s;es of commerce, be carried into the &s;ame in the manner afore&s;aid, by the ci|tizens of the United States, and &s;uch goods and merchan|dize &s;hall be &s;ubject to no higher or other duties than would be payable by his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects on the impor|tation of the &s;ame from Europe into the &s;aid territories. And in like manner, all goods and merchandize who&s;e importation into the United State &s;hall not be wholly
<PB N="6" REF="029747_0005_0FE2511B372C92A0">
prohibited, may freely, for the purpo&s;es of Commerce, be carried into the &s;ame, in the manner afore&s;aid, by his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and &s;uch goods and merchandize &s;hall be &s;ubject to no higher or other duties than would be payable by the citizens of the United States on the im|portation of the &s;ame in American ve&s;&s;els into the Atlan|tic ports of the &s;aid States. And all goods not prohi|bited to be exported from the &s;aid territories, re&s;pec|tively, may in like manner be carried out of the &s;ame by the two parties re&s;pectively, paying duty as afore|&s;aid.</P>
<P>No duty of entry &s;hall ever be levied by either par|ty on peltries brought by land, or inland navigation into the &s;aid territories re&s;pectively, nor &s;hall the Indi|ans pa&s;&s;ing or re-pa&s;&s;ing with their own proper goods and effects of whatever nature, pay for the &s;ame any im|po&s;t or duty whatever. But goods in bales, or other large packages unu&s;ual among Indians &s;hall not be con|&s;idered as goods belonging bona fide to Indians.</P>
<P>No higher or other tolls or rates of ferriage than what are or &s;hall be payable by natives, &s;hall be de|manded on either &s;ide; and no duties &s;hall be payable on any goods which &s;hall merely be carried over any of the portages or carrying places on either &s;ide; for the pur|po&s;e of being immediately reimbarked and carried to &s;ome other place or places. But as by this &s;tipulation it is only meant to &s;ecure to each party a free pa&s;&s;age accro&s;s the portages on both &s;ides, it is agreed, that this exemption from duty &s;hall extend only to &s;uch goods as are carried in the u&s;ual and direct road acro&s;s the portage, and are not attempted to be in any manner &s;old or exchanged during their pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s the &s;ame, and proper regulations may be e&s;tabli&s;hed to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of any frauds in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>As this article in intended to render in a great degree, the local advantages of each party common to both, and thereby to promote a di&s;po&s;ition favourable to friend|&s;hip
<PB N="7" REF="029747_0006_0FE2515326B8C010">
and good neighbourhood, it is agreed, that the re&s;pective Governments will mutually promote this amicable intercour&s;e, by cau&s;ing &s;peedy and impartial ju&s;tice to be done, and nece&s;&s;ary protection to be extend|ed to all who may be concerned therein.</P>
<P>ART. IV. Whereas it is uncertain whether the River Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi extends &s;o far to the Northward as to be in|ter&s;ected by a line to be drawn due We&s;t from the Lake of the Woods in the manner mentioned in the Treaty of Peace between his Maje&s;ty and the United States, it is a|greed, that mea&s;ures &s;hall be taken in concert between his Maje&s;ty's government in America and the govern|ment of the United States for making a joint &s;urvey of the &s;aid river from one degree of latitude below the Falls of St. Anthony, to the principal &s;ource or &s;ources of the &s;aid river, and al&s;o of the parts adjacent there|to; and that if on the re&s;ult of &s;uch &s;urvey, it &s;hould ap|pear that the &s;aid river would not be inter&s;ected by &s;uch a line as is above-mentioned, the two parties will thereupon proceed by amicable negociation to regulate the boundary line in that quarter, as well as all other points to be adju&s;ted between the &s;aid parties, according to ju&s;tice and mutual convenience, and in conformity to the intent of the &s;aid Treaty.</P>
<P>ART. V. Whereas doubts have ari&s;en what river was truly intended under the name of the river St. Croix men|tioned in the &s;aid Treaty of Peace, and forming a part of the boundary therein de&s;cribed, that que&s;tion &s;hall be re|ferred to the final deci&s;ion of Commi&s;&s;ions to be appoint|ed in the following manner, viz.</P>
<P>One Commi&s;&s;ioner &s;hall be named by his Maje&s;ty and one by the Pre&s;ident of the United States, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate thereof, and the &s;aid two Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall agree on the choice of a third; or if they cannot &s;o agree, they &s;hall each propo&s;e one per&s;on, and of the two names &s;o propo&s;ed, one &s;hall be drawn by lot in the pre&s;ence of the two original Com|mi&s;&s;ioners.
<PB N="8" REF="029747_0007_0FE2511D460A14E0">
And the three Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;o appointed, &s;hall be &s;worn impartially to examine and decide the &s;aid que&s;tion according to &s;uch evidence as &s;hall re&s;pec|tively be laid before them on the part of the Briti&s;h Government and of the U. States. The &s;aid Commi&s;&s;i|oners &s;hall meet at Halifax, and &s;hall have power to adjourn to &s;uch other place or places as they &s;hall think fit. They &s;hall have power to appoint a Scretary, and to employ &s;uch &s;urveyors or other per&s;ons as they &s;hall judge nece&s;&s;ary. The &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall by a de|claration under their hands and &s;eals decide what river is the River St. Croix intended by the treaty. The &s;aid declaration &s;hall contain a de&s;cription of the &s;aid river and &s;hall particularize the latitude and longitude of its mouth and of its &s;ource. Duplicates of this declara|tion and of the &s;tatements of their accounts, and of the journal of their proceedings &s;hall be delivered by them to the Agent of his Maje&s;ty and to the Agent of the Uni|ted States who may be re&s;pectively appointed and au|thorized to manage the bu&s;ine&s;s on behalf of the re&s;pec|tive Governments. And both parties agree to con&s;ider &s;uch deci&s;ion as final and conclu&s;ive, &s;o as that the &s;ame &s;hall never thereafter be called into que&s;tion, or made the &s;ubject of di&s;pute or difference between them.</P>
<P>ART, VI. Whereas it is alledged by divers Briti&s;h merchants and others his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, that debts to a considerable amount, which were bona fide contract|ed before the peace, &s;till remain owing to them by citi|zens or inhabitants of the United States, and that by the operation of various lawful impediments &s;ince the peace not only the full recovery of the &s;aid debts has been de|layed, but al&s;o the value and &s;ecurity thereof have, in &s;everal in&s;tances, impaired and le&s;&s;ened, &s;o that by the ordinary cour&s;e of judical proceedings, the Briti&s;h cre|ditors cannot now obtain, and actually have and receive full and adequate compen&s;ation for the lo&s;&s;es and dama|ges which they have thereby &s;u&s;tained: It is agreed, that
<PB N="9" REF="029747_0008_0FE2515B883FB990">
complaints, as under the &s;aid article &s;hall be preferred to the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners; and that I will forbear to act as a Commi&s;&s;ioner in any ca&s;e in which I may be per&s;on|ally intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>Three of the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall con&s;titute a board, and &s;hall have power to do any act appertaining to the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ion, provided that one of the Commi&s;|&s;ioners named on each &s;ide, and the fifth commi&s;&s;ioner &s;hall be pre&s;ent, and all deci&s;ions &s;hall be made by the majority of the voices of the Commi&s;&s;ioners then pre|&s;ent; 18 months from the day on which the &s;aid Com|mi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall form a board, and be ready to proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s, are a&s;&s;igned for receiving complaints, and applications; but they are neverthele&s;s authorized in any particular ca&s;es in which it &s;hall appear to them to be rea&s;onable and ju&s;t, to extend the &s;aid term of eighteen months for any term not exceeding &s;ix months, after the expiration thereof. The &s;aid Cemmi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">r&s;t meet at Philadelphia, but they &s;hall have pow|er to adjourn from place to place as they &s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners in examining the complaints and applications &s;o preferred to them, are empowered and required, in pur&s;uance of the true intent and mean|ing of this article, to take into their con&s;ideration all claims, whether of principal or intere&s;t, or balances of principal and intere&s;t, and to determine the &s;ame re&s;pec|tively, according to the merits of the &s;everal ca&s;es, due regard being had to all the circum&s;tances thereof, and as equity and ju&s;tice &s;hall appear to them to require. And the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall have power to exa|mine all &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hall come before them on oath or affirmation touching the premi&s;es; and al&s;o to re|ceive evidence according as they may think mo&s;t con|&s;i&s;tent with equity and ju&s;tice, all written depo&s;itions, or books, or paper, or copy, or extract being duly authen|ticated, either according to the legal forms now re&s;pec|tively exi&s;ting in the two countries, or in &s;uch other

manner as the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e to re|quire or allow.</P>
<P>The award of the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners or of any there of them as afore&s;aid, &s;hall in all ca&s;es be final and con|clu&s;ive, both as to the ju&s;tice of the claim, and to the amount of the &s;um to be paid to the creditor or claim|ant: And the United States undertake to cau&s;e the &s;um &s;o awarded to be paid in &s;pecie to &s;uch creditor or claim|ant without deduction; and at &s;uch time or times, and at &s;uch place or places, as &s;hall be awarded by the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners; and on condition of &s;uch relea&s;es or a&s;&s;ignment to be given by the creditor or claimant, as by the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners may be directed: Provided always, that no &s;uch payment &s;hall be fixed by the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners to take place &s;ooner than twelve months from the day of the exchange of the ratifications of this Treaty.</P>
<P>ART. VII. Whereas complaints have been made by divers merchants and others, citizens of the United States, that during the cour&s;e of the war in which his Maje&s;ty is now engaged, they have &s;u&s;tained con&s;idera|ble lo&s;&s;es and damage, by rea&s;on of irregular or illegal captures or condemnations of their ve&s;&s;els other pro|perty under colour of authority or commi&s;&s;ions from his Maje&s;ty, and that from various circum&s;tances belong|ing to the &s;aid ba&s;es, adequate compen&s;ation for the lo&s;&s;es and damages &s;o &s;u&s;tained cannot now be actually obtained, had and received by the ordinary cour&s;e of judicial proceedings; it is agreed, that in all &s;uch ca&s;es where adequate compensation cannot, for whatever rea&s;on, be now actually obtained, had and received by the &s;aid merchants and others in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, full and complete compen&s;ation for the &s;ame will be made by the Briti&s;h Government to the &s;aid complainants. But it is di&s;tinctly under&s;tood that this provi&s;ion is not to extend to &s;uch lo&s;&s;es or damages as
<PB N="11" REF="029747_0010_0FE2515F74F47138">
to this Treaty; the complaints of the parties &s;hall be and hereby are referred to the commi&s;&s;ioners to be ap|pointed by virtue of this article, who are hereby au|thorized and required to proceed in the like manner re|lative to the&s;e as to the other ca&s;es committed to them; and the United States undertake to pay to the complain|ants or claimants in &s;pecie, without deduction, the a|mount of &s;uch &s;ums as &s;hall be awarded to them re|&s;pectively by the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners, and at the times and places which in &s;uch awards &s;hall be &s;pecified; and on conditions of &s;uch relea&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> or a&s;&s;ignments to be given by the claimants as in the &s;aid awards may be directed: And it is further agreed that not only the now exi&s;ting ca&s;es of both de&s;criptions but al&s;o all &s;uch as &s;hall exi&s;t at the time of exchanging the ratifications of this trea|ty &s;hall be con&s;idered as being within the provi&s;ions, in|tent and meaning of this article.</P>
<P>ART. VIII. It is further agreed, that the commi&s;&s;ion|ers mentioned in this and in the two preceding articles &s;hall be re&s;pectively paid in &s;uch manner as &s;hall be a|greed between the two parties? &s;uch agreement being to be &s;ettled at the time of the exchange of the ratifi|cations of this Treaty. And all other expences attend|ing the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ions &s;hall be defrayed jointly by the two parties, the &s;ame being previou&s;ly a&s;certained and allowed by the majority of the commi&s;&s;ioners, And in the ca&s;e of death, &s;ickne&s;s or nece&s;&s;ary ab&s;ence, the place of every &s;uch commi&s;&s;ioner re&s;pectively &s;hall be &s;upplied in the &s;ame manner as &s;uch commi&s;&s;ioner was fir&s;t appointed, and the new commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall take the &s;ame oath or affirmation and do the &s;ame duties.</P>
<P>ART. IX. It is agreed that Briti&s;h &s;ubjects who now hold lands in the territories of the United States and A|merican Citizens who now hold lands in the dominions of his Maje&s;ty &s;hall continue to hold them according to the nature and tenure of their respective e&s;tates and ti|tles therein; and may grant, &s;ell or devi&s;e the &s;ame to

<P>ART. X. Neither the debts due from individuals of the other, for &s;hares nor monies which they may have in the public funds, or in the public or private banks &s;hall ever in any event of war or national differences be &s;eque&s;tered or confi&s;cated, it being unju&s;t and impolitic that debts and engagements contracted and made by individuals having confidence in each other and in their re&s;pective governments &s;hould ever be de&s;troyed or im|paired by national authority on account of national dif|ferences and di&s;contents.</P>
<P>ART. XI. It is agreed between his Maje&s;ty and the United States of America that there &s;hall be a recipro|cal and entirely perfect liberty of navigation and com|merce between their re&s;pective people; in the manner, under the limitations and on the conditions &s;pecified in the following articles.</P>

<P>ART. XVII.

<P>And whereas the difficulty of agreeing on the preci&s;e ca&s;es in which alone provi&s;ions and other articles not ge|nerally contraband may be regarded as &s;uch, renders it expedient to provide again&s;t the inconveniences and mi&s;|under&s;tandings which might thence ari&s;e: It is further agreed, that whenever any &s;uch articles &s;o becoming con|traband according to the exi&s;ting laws of Nations, &s;hall for that rea&s;on be &s;eized, the &s;ame &s;hall not be confi&s;|cated, but the owners thereof &s;hall be &s;peedily and com|pletely indemnified; and the captors, or in their default the government under who&s;e authority they act, &s;hall pay to the ma&s;ters or owners of &s;uch ve&s;&s;els the full value of all articles, with a rea&s;onable mercantile profit thereon, together with the freight, and al&s;o the demurrage inci|dent to &s;uch detention.</P>

But in ca&s;e it &s;hould &s;o happen, the party who&s;e territorial right &s;hall thus have been violated, &s;hall u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavors to obtain from the offending party full and ample &s;atsfaction for the ve&s;&s;el or ve&s;&s;els &s;o taken, whether the &s;ame be ve&s;&s;els of war or merchant ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>ART. XXVI. If at any time a rupture &s;hould take place (which God forbid) between his Maje&s;ty and the United States, the merchants and others of each of the two nations re&s;iding in the dominions of the other &s;hall have the privilege of remaining and continuing, their trade, &s;o long as they behave peaceably, and commit no offence again&s;t the laws; and in ca&s;e their conduct &s;hould render them &s;u&s;pected, and the re&s;pective governments &s;hould think proper to order them to remove, the term of twelve months from the publication of the order &s;hall be allowed them for that purpo&s;e, to remove with their families, effects and property; but this favor &s;hall not be extended to tho&s;e who &s;hall act contrary to the e&s;tab|li&s;hed laws; and for greater certainty it is declared, that &s;uch rupture &s;hall not be deemed to exi&s;t while negoci|ations for accommodating differences &s;hall be depend|ing, nor until the re&s;pective amba&s;&s;adors or mini&s;ters, if &s;uch there &s;hall be, &s;hall be recalled, or &s;ent home,
<PB N="25" REF="029747_0024_0FE2517E45741670">
on account of &s;uch differences, and not on account of per&s;onal mi&s;conduct, according to the nature and degrees of which both parties retain their rights, either to reque&s;t the, recal, or immediately to &s;end home the amba&s;&s;ador of mini&s;ter of the other; and that without prejedice to their mutual friend&s;hip and good under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>ART. XXVII. It is further agrreed, that his Maje&s;ty and the United States, or mutual requ&s;ition by them re|&s;pectively; or by their re&s;pective mini&s;ters or officers au|thorized to make the &s;ame, will deliver up to ju&s;tice all per&s;ons, who being charged with murder or forgery, com|mited within the juri&s;diction of either, &s;hall &s;eek an a&s;ylum within any of the countries of the other, provided that this &s;hall only be done on &s;uch evidence of cirminality as, according to the laws of the place, where the fugative or per&s;on &s;o charged &s;hall be found, would ju&s;tify his appre|hen&s;ion and commitment for trial, if the offence had there been committed. The expence of &s;uch apprehen&s;ion and delivery &s;hall be borne and defrayed by tho&s;e who make the requi&s;tion, and receive the fugitive.</P>
<P>ART. XXVIII. It is agreed, that the fir&s;t ten articles of this treaty &s;hall be permanent, and that the &s;ub&s;equent article, except the twelfth, &s;hall be limited in their dura|tion to twelve years, to be computed from the day on which the ratification of this treaty &s;hall be exchanged; but &s;ubject to this condition that whereas the &s;aid twelfth article will expire, by the limitation therein contained, at the end of two years from the &s;igning the preliminary or other articles of peace, which &s;hall terminate the pre|&s;ent war in which his Maje&s;ty is engaged; it is agreed, that proper mea&s;ures &s;hall by concert be taken for bring|ing the &s;ubject of that article into amicable treaty and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, &s;o early before the expiration of the &s;aid term, as that new arrangements on that head may by that time bo perfected and ready to take place. But if it &s;hould unfortunately happen, that his Maje&s;ty and the United States &s;hould not be able to agree on &s;uch new arrange|ments
<PB N="26" REF="029747_0025_0FE2513FB81A51E8">
in that ca&s;e all the articles of this treaty, except the fir&s;t ten, &s;hall then coa&s;e and expire together.</P>
<P>La&s;tly. This treaty, when the &s;ame &s;hall have been ra|tified by his Maje&s;ty, and by the Pre&s;ident of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of their Se|nate, and the re&s;pective ratification mutually exchanged, &s;hall be binding and obligatory on his Maje&s;ty and on the &s;aid States, and &s;hall be by them re&s;pectively executed and ob&s;erved with punctuality, and the mo&s;t &s;incere regard to good faith. And whereas it will be expedient, in or|der the better to facilitate intercour&s;e and obviate diffi|culties, that other articles be propo&s;ed and added to this treaty which articles, for want of time and other circum|&s;tances, cannot now be perfected&mdash;it is agreed, that the &s;aid parties will, from time to time, readily treat of and concerning &s;uch articles, and will &s;incerely endeavour &s;o to form them, as that they may conduce to mutual convenience, and tend to promote mutual &s;atisfaction and friend&s;hip; and that the &s;aid articles, after having been truly ratified, &s;hall be added to, and make a part of this treaty. In faith whereof, we, the under&s;igned Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary of his maje&s;ty the King of Great-Britain, and the United States of America, have &s;igned this pre&s;ent Treaty, and have cau&s;ed to be fixed there|to the &s;eal of our arms.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Philadelphia, <DATE>September 5, 1793</DATE>.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am honored with yours of Augu&s;t 30. Mine of the 7th of that month a&s;&s;ured you that mea&s;ures were taken for excluding from all further a&s;ylum in our ports ve&s;&s;els armed in them to cruize on nations with which we are at peace and for the re&s;toration of the prizes the Lovely La&s;s, Prince William Henry, and the Jane of Dublin; and that &s;hould the mea&s;ures for re&s;titution fail in their effect, the Pre&s;ident considered it as incumbent on the U. S. to make compen&s;ation for the ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>We are bound by our Treaties with three of the bel|ligerent nations, by all the means in our power to pro|tect and defend their ve&s;&s;els and effects in our ports, or waters, or on the &s;eas near our &s;hores, and to recover and re&s;tore the &s;ame to the right owners when taken from them. If all the means in our power are u&s;ed, and fail in their effect, we are not bound by our treaties with tho&s;e nations to make compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Though we have no &s;imilar Treaty with Great Britain, it was the opinion of the Pre&s;ident, that we &s;hould u&s;e towards that nation the &s;ame rule, which under this ar|ticle, was to govern us with the other nations; and e|ven to extend it to captures made on the high &s;eas, and brought into our ports; if done by ve&s;&s;els which had been armed within them.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="029747_0027_0FE251414CDA15B8">Having for particular rea&s;ons, forbore to u&s;e all the means in our power for the re&s;titution of the three ve&s;|&s;els mentioned in my letter of Augu&s;t 7th, the Pre&s;ident thought it incumbent on the U. S. to make compen&s;ati|on for them: And though nothing was &s;aid in that let|ter of other ve&s;&s;els taken under like circum&s;tances and brought in after the fifth of June, and before the date of that letter, yet when the forbearance had taken place it was and is his opinion that compen&s;ation would be e|qually due.</P>
<P>As to prizes make under the &s;ame circum&s;tances, and bro't in after the date of that letter the Pre&s;ident deter|mined that all the means in our power &s;hould be u&s;ed for their re&s;titution. If the&s;e &s;aid, as we &s;hould not be bound by our treaties to make compen&s;ation to the other powers in the analogous ca&s;e, he did not mean to give an opinion that it ought to be done to Great Britain. But &s;till if any ca&s;es &s;hall ari&s;e &s;ub&s;equent to that date, the circum&s;tances of which &s;hall place them on &s;imilar ground with tho&s;e before it, the Pre&s;ident would think compen&s;ation equally incumbant on the United States.</P>
<P>In&s;tructions are given to the governors of the differ|ent &s;tates to u&s;e all the means in their power for re&s;tor|ing prizes of this la&s;t de&s;cription found within their ports. Tho' they will of cour&s;e take mea&s;ures to be informed of them, and the general government has given them the aid of the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e officers for this purpo&s;e, yet you will be &s;en&s;ible of the importance of multiplying the channels of their information as far as &s;hall depend on your&s;elf, or any per&s;on under your direction, in or|der that the governors may u&s;e the means in their power for making re&s;titution.</P>
<P>Without knowledge of the capture they cannot re|&s;tore it. It will always be be&s;t to give the notice to them directly; but any information which you &s;hall be plea&s;ed to &s;end to me al&s;o at any time, &s;hall be forward|ed to them quickly as di&s;tance will permit.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="029747_0028_0FE25181B17489A8">Hence you will perceive &s;ir, that the Pre&s;ident con|templates re&s;titution or compen&s;ation in the ca&s;es before the &s;eventh of Augu&s;t: and after that date re&s;titution if it can be effected by any means in our power. And that it will be important that you &s;hould &s;ub&s;tantiate the fact, that &s;uch prizes are in our ports or waters.</P>
<P>Your li&s;t of the privateers illicitly armed in our port is, I believe, correct.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to lo&s;&s;es by detention, wa&s;te, &s;poilation &s;u&s;tained by ve&s;&s;els taken as before-mentioned between the dates of June 5th and 7th, it is propo&s;ed as a provi|&s;ional mea&s;ure, that the Collector of the cu&s;toms of the di&s;trict, and the Briti&s;h Con&s;ul, or any other per&s;on you plea&s;e, &s;hall appoint per&s;ons to e&s;tabli&s;h the value of the ve&s;&s;el and cargo, at the time of her capture and of her arrival in the port into which &s;he is brought, according to their value in that port. If this &s;hall be agreeable to you, and you will be plea&s;ed to &s;ignify it to me, with the names of the prizes under&s;tood to be of this de&s;crip|tion, in&s;tructions will be given accordingly to the Col|lector of the cu&s;toms where the re&s;pective ve&s;&s;els are.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. TAZEWELL's MOTION.</HEAD>
<P>That the Pre&s;ident of the United States be informed, that the Senate will not con&s;ent to the ratification of the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, between the United States and his Brittannic Maje&s;ty, concluded at London on the 19th of November, 1794, for the rea|&s;ons following:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>l. Becau&s;e &s;o much of the treaty as was intended to ter|minate the complaints, flowing from the inexecution of the treaty of 1783, contains &s;tipulations that were not rightfully or ju&s;tly requirable of the United States, and which are both impolitic and injurious to their intere&s;t: and becau&s;e the treaty hath not &s;ecured that &s;atisfaction from the British government, for the removal of negroes in violation of the treaty of 1783, to which the citizens of the United States were ju&s;tly entitled.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Becau&s;e the rights of individual States are, by the 9th article of this treaty, uncon&s;titutionally invaded.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Becau&s;e however impolitic or unju&s;t it may gener|rally be, to exerci&s;e the power prohibited by the 10th article, yet it re&s;ts on legi&s;lative di&s;cretion, and ought not to be prohibited by treaty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Becau&s;e &s;o much of the treaty as relates to commer|cial arrangements between the parties, wants that reci|procity, upon which alone &s;uch like arrangements ought to be founded, and will operate ruinou&s;ly to the Ameri|can commerce and navigation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Becau&s;e the treaty prevents the United States from the exerci&s;e of that controul over their commerce and navigation, as connected with other nations, which might better the condition of their intercour&s;e with friendly nations.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Becau&s;e the treaty a&s;&s;erts a power in the Pre&s;ident and Senate, to controul and even annihilate the con&s;ti|tutional right of the congre&s;s of the United States over their commercial intercour&s;e with foreign nations.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="32" REF="029747_0031_0FE2514FFA9D2850">7. Becau&s;e if the con&s;truction of this treaty &s;hould not produce an infraction of the treaties now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween the United States and their allies, it is calculated to excite &s;en&s;ations which may not operate beneficially to the United States.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Senate will not con&s;ent to the ratification of this treaty, they advi&s;e the Pre&s;ident of the United States to continue his endeavours, by friendly di&s;cu&s;&s;ion with his Britannic Maje&s;ty, to adju&s;t all the real cau&s;es of complaint between the two nations.</P>
