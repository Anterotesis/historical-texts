<HEAD>TO The mo&s;t renowned, mo&s;t formidable, and mo&s;t tremendous KNIGHT, GIANT, and <HI>GRAND CALUMNIATOR-GENERAL,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Quil&s;ylvania,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MOST DREADFUL SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT me to approach your IMMENSITY with the <HI>fir&s;t Attempt</HI> of a young Genius, ambitious of di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf in that mo&s;t noble and mo&s;t honourable of all Arts&mdash;the ART OF CALUMNY.</P>
<P>THE Voice of Mankind would condemn me, were I, on this Occa&s;ion, to &s;ollicit the Patronage of any other than "You, SIR, the great CALUM|NIATOR of the Province, who&s;e dire Delight was ever in the Carnage of Characters, and who, like &s;ome GIANT in Romance, &s;it viewing, with hor|rid Plea&s;ure, the mangled Limbs of murdered Reputations &s;trow'd all around your Ca&s;tle."</P>
<P>TO you, Sir, are we indebted for tho&s;e Volumes of unparallel'd Obloquy and Slander, which have &s;o largely contributed to the Happine&s;s of this flou|ri&s;hing Province.&mdash;Not that you deign'd to write your&s;elf (tho' &s;o highly capable) but that you gra|ciou&s;ly promoted Writing in others.</P>
<P>SPEAKING, Sir, is your <HI>Excellence!</HI> Your Mouth alone can utter more true genuine Detraction in one Hour, than all the <HI>learned</HI> Doctors of the College (a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the <HI>decent</HI> Mr. <HI>D-ve</HI> and the <HI>magna|nimous</HI> Mr. <HI>D&mdash;n</HI>) can di&s;charge from their calumniating Pens in a Fortnight.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="010014_0003_0F7B98756D7AB728">LET a Man but dare to appear even <HI>in Defence</HI> of the Character of his Friend, his Relation, or him&s;elf; and, in an In&s;tant, you be&s;mear and cover him with &s;uch a thick Slime of Slander, that was it not for that powerful <HI>Men&s;truum</HI> called TRUTH, he would &s;carcely ever become &s;o clean&s;ed as to be known again by his former Acquaintance.</P>
<P>SUCH are the happy Effects of your Voyages to <HI>England</HI> in your youthful, and later Days! For &s;uch are the Advantages which have re&s;ulted to you from a clo&s;e Attendance on the Lectures of tho&s;e celebrated Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of our Art, the &mdash;NAIADS <HI>of</HI> BILLINGSGATE!</P>
<P>I am fully &s;en&s;ible, Sir, that this Performance will, in Point of <HI>pure unadulterated Scurrility,</HI> fall far &s;hort of tho&s;e excellent Pieces which your Patronage has lately been the Means of procuring for the Benefit of Society. Should it, however, be the happy Means of my obtaining your Pro|tection and Encouragement, I cannot but flatter my&s;elf that I may, fired with Emulation, hereafter rival the <HI>Sentiment-Dre&s;&s;er-General</HI> him&s;elf!</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> on Mr. H&mdash;s's <HI>Adverti&s;ement,</HI> tho' highly &s;ea&s;on'd with Scurrility, are yet va&s;tly inferior in that Re&s;pect to the <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to Mr. F&mdash;n's <HI>Remarks.</HI> For this Rea&s;on I cho&s;e the former for the Subject of my <HI>fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay,</HI> hoping that if I &s;hould be &s;o lucky as to &s;ucceed in imitating <HI>That,</HI> I might in Time ri&s;e to an Imitation of the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>UNPARDONABLE would it be, Sir, were I to pa&s;s over in Silence the Obligations you have con|ferred on all <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> America, in &s;o wi&s;ely and bravely <HI>daring</HI> the Mini&s;try and Parliament to burthen us

with Taxes. The good Effects of this <HI>Policy</HI> are now mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly felt, and mu&s;t ever be held in grateful Remembrance.</P>
<P>NOR &s;hould I forget to mention, how much this Province is peculiarly beholden to you for the Intro|duction of <HI>Clubs, Corruption</HI> and <HI>Perjury</HI> at our an|nual <HI>Elections;</HI> than which nothing could have been better adapted for the Pre&s;ervation of that valuable Part of our Privileges.</P>
<P>AS well might I omit to acknowledge the Services you have rendered this Country, in promoting the Cultivation of the <HI>fine Arts.</HI> The Public Spirit, and Liberality of the famous Society in England, are no ways comparable to what you have exerted and &s;hown on this Account. The Art of <HI>Engraving,</HI> in particular, which was thought to be on its Decline among <HI>Britons,</HI> has, by your <HI>generous Bounty,</HI> and under your <HI>Au&s;pices,</HI> been lately carried to a Height of Perfection unknown to the mo&s;t able Ma&s;ters, antient or modern.</P>
<P>SUFFER me likewi&s;e, Sir, to congratulate you and the Public, on your new-form'd Alliance with that SCUNK OF SCURRILITY <HI>D&mdash;d J&mdash;s D-ve!</HI> From an Union of &s;uch <HI>kindred Souls</HI> what Ble&s;&s;ings may not be expected!</P>
<P>Our ART mu&s;t flouri&s;h to its full Extent,</P>
<P>When <HI>D-ve</HI> &s;hall <HI>write</HI> what <HI>Al&mdash;n</HI> &s;hall <HI>invent!</HI></P>
<P>But, Sir, &s;uch is your unbounded Benevolence of Soul, that, not contented with be&s;towing Favours on <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> America in general, you have even exten|ded your Obligations to the declared Enemies of your King and Country!&mdash;generou&s;ly &s;upplying them in the Time of their Di&s;tre&s;s with <HI>Warlike Stores</HI> and <HI>Provi&s;ions.</HI></P>

<P>_IT is generally expected from an Author, that he &s;hould <HI>preface</HI> his Performance, in order to acquaint his Readers with the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Work they are about to enter upon, and his <HI>Motive</HI> for writing.

<HEAD>PROLOGUE to the <HI>Coffee-Hou&s;e Politician,</HI> or the JUSTICE <HI>caught in his own</HI> TRAP.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN ancient Greece, the infant Mu&s;e's School,</L>
<L>Where Vice fir&s;t felt the Pen of Ridicule,</L>
<L>With hone&s;t Freedom and impartial Blows,</L>
<L>The Mu&s;e attack'd each Vice as it aro&s;e:</L>
<L>No Grandeur could the <HI>mighty Villain</HI> &s;creen</L>
<L>From the ju&s;t Satyr of the comic Scene:</L>
<L>No <HI>Titles</HI> could the daring Poet cool,</L>
<L>Nor &s;ave the great-<HI>great honourable Fool.</HI></L>
<L>They &s;par'd not even the Aggre&s;&s;or's <HI>Name,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>publick Villainy</HI> felt <HI>publick Shame.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long hath this gen'rous Method been di&s;us'd,</L>
<L>For Vice hath grown <HI>too great</HI> to be abus'd;</L>
<L>By <HI>Pow'r defended</HI> from the piercing Dart,</L>
<L>It reigns and triumphs in the <HI>Judge</HI>'s Heart,</L>
<L>While <HI>Beaux,</HI> and <HI>Cits,</HI> and <HI>Squires,</HI> our Scenes afford,</L>
<L>Ju&s;tice pre&s;erves the Rogues who wield her Sword;</L>
<L>All Satyr again&s;t her Tribunal's qua&s;h'd,</L>
<L>Nor la&s;h the Bards, for fear of being la&s;h'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But the heroick Mu&s;e who &s;ings to Night,</L>
<L>Through the&s;e neglected Tracks attempts her Flight:</L>
<L><HI>Vice</HI> cloath'd with <HI>Pow'r,</HI> &s;he <HI>combats</HI> with her Pen,</L>
<L>And fearle&s;s, <HI>dares</HI> the LYON in his Den.</L>

<P>As to any other <HI>Motive</HI> I had in writing, I can with Truth a&s;&s;ure my Reader, that I &s;hould not have thought of putting Pen to Paper on this Subject, after peru&s;ing what Mr. <HI>H&mdash;</HI> publi&s;hed in An&s;wer to <HI>Part</HI> of the <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> on his <HI>Adverti&s;ement,</HI> had I not been &s;timulated thereto by the Appearance of a <HI>Print</HI> publi&s;hed by the Pr&mdash;ry Party a few Days after, with a View of blackening the Reputations of &s;ome of the mo&s;t valuable Men in the Community.</P>
<P>When I was credibly informed, that the chief Magi&s;trate of <HI>Quil&s;ylvania</HI> was principally in&s;trumental in obtaining that extraordinary Production, and that he even gave the Author a con&s;iderable Sum of Money to enable him to bring his Perfor|mance into the World, tho' that very Author was well known to have frequently lampoon'd him and his Adherents, I could not but promi&s;e my&s;elf, that &s;hould I likewi&s;e be able to &s;ucceed in la&s;hing them &s;everely, he might al&s;o think it proper to <HI>buy</HI> me over to his Party, and afford me that Encourage|ment and A&s;&s;i&s;tance which are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to a young Author of &s;lender Fortune.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t form'd the Re&s;olution of attacking the Ch&mdash;f and his Party, it was my Purpo&s;e to endeavour to u&s;e the Weapons of delicate Satire and Ridicule; but upon con&s;idering the Nature of the <HI>Bodies</HI> I was about to a&s;&s;ault, I was &s;oon convinced that I might as well attempt to penetrate into the Heart of a Butcher's Block with a Razor.&mdash;Be&s;ides, as tho&s;e incomparable Ma&s;ters, whom I have taken for my Pattern; have &s;o well &s;ucceeded by the U&s;e of the <HI>Cleaver</HI> alone, it would be very imprudent in me were I to make my fir&s;t Attempt with any other Weapon.</P>

<P>WITH your Leave, Gentle Reader, we will open one of the&s;e <HI>Papers,</HI> examine its Contents, and analy&s;e the Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>WE find then, in the fir&s;t Place, that <Q>Mr. H&mdash;s, for very &s;ub&s;tantial Rea&s;ons, is &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>not</HI> to be the Author of his Challenge.</Q> What tho&s;e <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial Rea&s;ons</HI> may be, we are, however left to gue&s;s till we come to the la&s;t Paragraph, where it is intimated, that he is not <Q>capable of writing an Adverti&s;ement.</Q> Suppo&s;e this to be really the Ca&s;e (which, by the Bye, no one the lea&s;t acquainted with Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> will admit) pray, is it the le&s;s his Challenge on that Account?

But I look upon the Paper in que&s;tion to be not &s;o much a <HI>political</HI> as a <HI>per|&s;onal</HI> Paper: Far the greate&s;t Part of it con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>per&s;onal Reflections</HI> again&s;t Mr. <HI>F&mdash;n.</HI> Now, I am told by tho&s;e who have re&s;ided in England, that it is very <HI>uncommon</HI> there to attack in Print a Per&s;on's <HI>private Character</HI> on account of any Difference in Sentiments about <HI>publick Affairs;</HI> and that <HI>Wilkes</HI> and <HI>Churchill</HI> are almo&s;t the only Dealers in that dirty Bu&s;ine&s;s who have appeared there for many Years. The fir&s;t of the&s;e we find, has on that Account been outlawed by King, Lords, and Commons; and the &s;econd held in Dete&s;tation by every good Man throughout the King's Dominions. Nor can I find that the Practice was ever introduced into this Country, till the <HI>very Revd.</HI> Dr. <HI>S&mdash;h</HI> made his Appearance, and we all know what great <HI>Veneration</HI> and <HI>E&s;teem</HI> he has thereby acquired.&mdash;It is therefore not to be wondered at, if Per&s;ons of their Stamp &s;hould not think it <HI>convenient</HI> to be known to the Publick.</P>
<P>But <Q>the Cau&s;e of Liberty (we are told) would often be left to &s;uffer, if her Advocates were obliged to expo&s;e their Names to the Clamor of Party or the Re&s;entment of Power.</Q> In &s;o glorious a Cau&s;e as that of <HI>Liberty,</HI> no Man ought to be afraid to &s;tand forth.

<P>IT is &s;aid, however, that <Q>almo&s;t all Mr. <HI>F</HI>'s political Pieces have appeared without a Name, &s;uch as, his <HI>Preface</HI> to Mr. <HI>G&mdash;y</HI>'s Speech, his <HI>Cool Thoughts,</HI> his <HI>Narrative,</HI> his <HI>Hi&s;torical Review,</HI> and many more, in which he has taken great Freedom with the Characters of others.</Q> But, to have &s;hown that Mr. <HI>F&mdash;n</HI>'s Con|duct was &s;imilar to our Author's, he &s;hould have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> an In&s;tance of that Gentleman's having publi&s;hed an <HI>anonymous An&s;wer</HI> to &s;ome Piece that had been publi&s;hed with the <HI>Writer's Name</HI> &s;ub&s;cribed, and had therein attack|ed the &s;aid Writer's <HI>private Character.</HI> As to the Pieces mentioned, they are very far from proving any Thing to the Point.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Preface</HI> is an anonymous An&s;wer to Par&s;on <HI>Pe&mdash;rs</HI>'s, Par&s;on <HI>S&mdash;th</HI>'s, Par&s;on <HI>Al&mdash;on</HI>'s, and Par&s;on <HI>Ew&mdash;n</HI>'s anonymous Preface to what was <HI>called</HI> Mr. <HI>Dic&mdash;n</HI>'s Speech. Yet tho' he was greatly reflected upon in their Preface, he has but ju&s;t named the fir&s;t as it were, and of the &s;econd all that he has &s;aid, which is any Ways per|&s;onal, is, "<HI>S&mdash;h</HI> that <HI>Poi&s;oner</HI> of other Men's Characters." And, when 'tis con&s;idered how long Mr. <HI>F&mdash;n</HI> had patiently borne with that pro&s;titute Writer's Attack on his Character, it is &s;urpri&s;ing he let him off &s;o gently. The other two Rev. <HI>A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins</HI> he has not &s;o much as mentioned in any Thing he has <HI>yet</HI> wrote.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Cool Thoughts</HI> do not contain one &s;ingle Thing relative to any Man's Character in the Province, but is a mere <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to &s;uch <HI>Objections</HI> as had been made again&s;t a <HI>Royal Government.</HI></P>

Was it not highly approved of by the G&mdash;r, Mr. <HI>H&mdash;n,</HI> the At&mdash;y Gen&mdash;I, Mr. <HI>Pe&mdash;rs,</HI> and every Pr&mdash;ry Minion in the Province?

And, la&s;tly, was not this very extraordinary Conduct, and the afterwards in&s;i&s;ting on the <HI>be&s;t</HI> of the Pr&mdash;ry's Land being tax'd <HI>no higher</HI> than the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> of the People's, the <HI>principal Cau&s;es</HI> of a Majority of the Freeholders, and their Repre&s;entatives, determining on a

<P>THERE remains then on the Li&s;t, only, "His <HI>Hi&s;torical Review</HI>" as it is called; but as I am well a&s;&s;ured from good Authority, that he did not compile that Work, and as it is little more than a mete Relation of the publick Conduct of the &s;everal Branches of our Legi&s;lature, there is nothing farther nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid on that Head.&mdash;And as to the "many more" of his political Pieces, which our Author has not named, he is defy'd to produce one wherein Mr. <HI>F&mdash;n</HI> begun an Attack on any Man's Reputation. If in any <Q>he has taken great Freedom with the Characters of others,</Q> it is only where he has been drove to it <HI>in his own Defence,</HI> and after he had pa&s;s'd by &s;o many villainous A&s;per&s;ions of his Character, as to induce his Calumniators to think they might continue to abu&s;e him with Impunity.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>F&mdash;n</HI>'s Friends are next a&s;ked, <Q>Why they will in&s;i&s;t upon a Practice &s;o different from his own, and even make it a Condition on which alone they will make a <HI>Reply?</HI></Q> They do not, as appears from what is already &s;aid, in&s;i&s;t upon any Practice <HI>different</HI> from his own; all they a&s;k, and in which every hone&s;t Man will think them right, is&punc; that his Adver&s;aries will act in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> open Manner he has done, and &s;ub&s;cribe their Names to their Performance.&mdash; Even his <HI>anonymous</HI> Pieces were &s;o far from being di&s;own'd by him, that he always, upon being a&s;k'd, acknowledged he was the Author. But of all the Shoal of anonymous Prop&mdash;ry Papers which have appeared during our Conte&s;ts, there cannot be found a Man that will own one of them; on the contrary, the greate&s;t Care and Pains is taken to conceal the Names of their &s;everal Writers.</P>

<P>HOWEVER, &s;etting a&s;ide the "blundering Simplicity" of our Author, who &s;tiles Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> a "<HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Squire," tho' he was born in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> I &s;hall proceed to the next Sentence, which is indeed a curious One. It is there &s;aid, that Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> <Q>by calling for a Gentleman of Character to enter the Li&s;ts with him, is made to pay him&s;elf the Compliment of being a <HI>Gentleman of Charac|ter,</HI> and to allow Mr. <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> to be the &s;ame, tho' the Author of the <HI>Remarks</HI> had a&s;&s;erted the direct contrary.</Q> On this I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that if Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> did really call Mr. <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> a Gentleman of Character, he then certainly might call him&s;elf &s;o, without incurring the Imputation of paying him&s;elf a Compliment. But as he really did <HI>not</HI> make u&s;e of that Appellation to Mr. <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> he &s;tands totally clear of the Charge. His Words are, <Q>if Mr. <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> OR any Gentleman of Character.</Q> Here is a very plain Di&s;tinction made by him, and it is evident he could not intend to compliment Mr. <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> with that Title; for, if he had, he would have &s;aid, <Q>or any <HI>other</HI> Gentle|man of Character, &amp;c.</Q> &mdash; The Author of the <HI>Remarks</HI> likewi&s;e &s;tands as clear of the Charge of having <Q><HI>a&s;&s;erted</HI> that Mr. <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> was <HI>not</HI> a Gentleman of Character,</Q> for he has <HI>a&s;&s;erted</HI> no &s;uch Thing. It mu&s;t, however, be allowed, that he pointed out &s;ome Parts of Mr. <HI>A&mdash;n</HI>'s Conduct which prove he has not always acted up to the Character of a Gentleman.</P>
<P>WE are next told, <Q>that the greate&s;t Part of the Charges in the <HI>An&s;wer</HI> are taken from the <HI>Prote&s;t,</HI> which has been &s;igned not only by Mr. <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> but nine other Gentlemen of <HI>undi&s;puted</HI> Character, and therefore any further Signing would have been unnece&s;&s;ary.</Q> This al&s;o is a gro&s;s Mi&s;repre&s;entation; for &s;carce a Tenth Part of the Charges are taken from the <HI>Prote&s;t.</HI> A con|&s;iderable

<P>I have, however, &s;o much Charity as to believe that &s;everal of the <HI>Prote&s;ters</HI> are now &s;o a&s;hamed of the &s;can|dalous Part they have acted, that they would refu&s;e to do the like again, even tho' directed by Mr. <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> and threaten'd with the Lo&s;s of their Commi&s;&s;ions. It is but Ju&s;tice too that I &s;hould mention my having heard that one of them has declared, "He almo&s;t wi&s;hed his Hand had been cut off before he &s;ign'd the Prote&s;t, but that he was prevailed upon to do it again&s;t his Judgment."</P>
<P>AND when Mr. <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> him&s;elf was interrogated concern|ing the Rea&s;on of his Conduct on the Occa&s;ion. He an|&s;wered, that he was hurried into it, having &s;carce Time to read the Paper over; for that he received it while he was at Dinner at <HI>New Ca&s;tle,</HI> with a Letter from Philadelphia, purporting, "That if he did not &s;ign it fir&s;t none of the re&s;t would, and that there would likewi&s;e be Danger of &s;ome of <HI>their</HI> Country Members not joining them at a future Se&s;&s;ions, unle&s;s they could carry down with them &s;ome &s;pecious Rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify their Conduct to their Con&s;titu|ents,

Mr. <HI>C&mdash;w</HI> read it accordingly, and advi&s;ed Mr. <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> in Words to this Effect: "By no Means put your Name to it &mdash;it is a vey fooli&s;h Affair &mdash;can be of no Service to our Cau&s;e &mdash;and if you &s;ign it you may depend that Mr. <HI>F&mdash;n</HI> will expo&s;e you in &s;uch a Manner as to make you repent it as long as you live." Sign it, however, he did, and gloried in it till the <HI>Remarks</HI> appeared. When they came out, he was in a terrible Tre|pidation indeed. "Wha-wha-wha-What&punc; (&s;ays he to one of his Acquaintance) can make Mr. <HI>F&mdash;n</HI> u&s;e me in this Manner &mdash;He-he-he &s;eems angry!

For In&s;tance: After &s;uppo&s;ing Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> "to call out aloud to a <HI>ma&s;k'd Ruffian</HI> (whom he had ob&s;erved to come <HI>behind</HI> his <HI>Friend</HI> and give him a <HI>&s;ound Drubbing</HI>) that if the Villain would but <HI>&s;how his Face,</HI> or <HI>tell his Name,</HI> he <HI>would grind him to Powder,</HI>" he tells us, that <Q><HI>ju&s;t &s;o</HI> the re|nowned Don Quixote, <HI>meeting</HI> a few Merchants, cried out, Let the whole World &s;tand &s;till, and if the whole World will not confe&s;s, affirm, and &s;wear, that the Em|pre&s;s <HI>Dulcinea</HI> (who by the Bye was only a common Trollop) is the mo&s;t beautiful Dam&s;el in the World, I challenge you all to Battle.</Q> Now as it may po&s;&s;ibly happen, that &s;ome of my Readers may be as &s;tupid as I was upon the fir&s;t Reading of this Pa&s;&s;age, and not comprehend the lea&s;t Re&s;emblance between Don Quixote's <HI>meeting</HI> a <HI>few Merchants</HI> Face to Face, and Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI>'s <HI>ob&s;erving</HI> a <HI>ma&s;k'd Ruffian</HI> to come <HI>behind</HI> his <HI>Friend, &amp;c.</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to give them &s;uch Lights into this Matter as I have, by Dint of hard Study, or otherwi&s;e, been able to procure. I &s;uppo&s;e then the <HI>"few Merchants"</HI> are in|tended to allude to tho&s;e of that Profe&s;&s;ion among the <HI>Pro|te&s;ters,</HI> who, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, did at fir&s;t <HI>&s;how their Faces,</HI> and <HI>tell their Names;</HI> but, as they afterwards put on their <HI>Vi&s;ors,</HI> and acted a ba&s;e, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Part,
<PB N="31" REF="010014_0016_0F7B988082551F48">
they then became <HI>ma&s;k'd Ruffians,</HI> re&s;embling the one Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> ob&s;erved to come <HI>behind</HI> his Friend. But what Affinity there is between the DON's challenging the Mer|chants <HI>to Battle</HI> if they <HI>did not confe&s;s</HI> that <HI>Dulcinea</HI> was the mo&s;t beautiful Dam&s;el in the World, and Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI>'s threatning the <HI>ma&s;k'd Ruffian</HI> that if he <HI>did confe&s;s</HI> his <HI>own Name,</HI> or <HI>&s;hew his Face,</HI> he would <HI>grind him to Powder,</HI> is what I have not yet been able to di&s;cover; and I am apprehen&s;ive, that if the <HI>"whole World was to &s;tand &s;till"</HI> till Doom's-day in the Afternoon, the <HI>whole World</HI> would not even then comprehend a Whit more of the Matter than my&s;elf. &mdash; I was al&s;o for a long Time puzzled to find the corre&s;pondent Part of the Simile belonging to <HI>"common Trollop,"</HI> when luckily for me, a worthy <HI>Friend</HI> &s;ugge&s;ted that it mu&s;t certainly be "&s;ound <HI>Drubbing;</HI>" for that our Author having &s;ome Time ago taken it into his Head to treat a virtuous young Woman at <HI>Frankford,</HI> as if &s;he had been really a <HI>common Trollop,</HI> &s;he &s;natch'd up a Broom&s;tick and gave him &s;uch a terrible <HI>"&s;ound Drubbing,"</HI> that he has not &s;ince been able to &s;eparate the Ideas. How this may be, I can't &s;ay, but I think the Solution ingenious, and that it has an Air of Probability.</P>
<P>BUT &s;hould our Author not have properly fitted the &s;everal Parts of his Simile, great Allowance ought to be made for a Man who has been &s;o long <HI>ob&s;erving</HI> in the <HI>Dark,</HI> that his very Under&s;tanding has become <HI>darken'd.</HI> On this Account I can readily excu&s;e his &s;aying, That <Q>as his Quarrel with Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI>'s Friend was of a <HI>publick</HI> Nature, he would treat him <HI>accordingly;</HI></Q> which, to be &s;ure, he has <HI>accordingly</HI> done by keeping him&s;elf <HI>private.</HI> The &s;ame Con&s;ideration too prompts me to readily pa&s;s over &s;everal of his <HI>Grammatical Errors</HI> without Cen&s;ure, particularly where he tells us, that <Q>if any <HI>Per&s;on</HI> of Character who <HI>is</HI> known to be capable of writing an Adverti&s;ement, will, to &s;ave Trouble, mention what Part of the An&s;wer &s;tands in need of further Proof, THEY will find the Satisfaction THEY de&s;ire.</Q> Be&s;ides I do

not &s;ee any Rea&s;on why learned Doctors and Profe&s;&s;ors in a College &s;hould be compell'd to the Ob&s;ervance of Gram|mar Rules: It is &s;ufficient that they <HI>endeavour</HI> to teach them to others. Per&s;ons who are really <HI>"capable of writing an Adverti&s;ement"</HI> would merit our Cen&s;ure, perhaps, were they not to write grammatically; but as our learned Doctors and Profe&s;&s;ors cannot, with any Propriety, be included among tho&s;e, they are therefore very excu&s;e|able.</P>
<P>AS I profe&s;s my&s;elf to be a mere Imitator, I ought, according to the Example of our Author, in the Paragraph before me, give you a long String of <HI>Suppo&s;itions</HI> founded upon <HI>fal&s;e</HI> Repre&s;entations. But as I have not exhau&s;ted a Hundredth Part of the Stock of <HI>Truths</HI> I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of again&s;t him and his Employers, I think I may be excu&s;ed having Recour&s;e to <HI>Fal&s;ities</HI> till the &s;aid Stock is nearly expended. The following <HI>Suppo&s;itions</HI> therefore, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as having Truth for their Ba&s;is, and con&s;equently &s;o far deviating from tho&s;e of our Author. <HI>Suppo&s;e</HI> then, that &s;ome "dreadful <HI>Giant</HI> or <HI>Knight</HI>" &s;hould, partly from the Malice and Envy of his Heart, and partly to oblige his Superior the great HABERDASHER of <HI>Grace-Church-Street,</HI> determine to de&s;troy the <HI>Champion</HI> who guarded the <HI>Golden Fruit,</HI> called <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Privileges,</HI> belonging to the People of <HI>Quil&s;ylvania,</HI> which the &s;aid <HI>Haberda&s;her</HI> wanted to get into his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. <HI>Suppo&s;e</HI> that the &s;aid <HI>Giant</HI> &s;hould for this Purpo&s;e take to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance eight or nine of the mo&s;t wicked and obedient of his Va&s;&s;als and Atten|dants, and attack the Champion openly in the Highway, hoping that by their united Strength they &s;hould totally overpower him. <HI>Suppo&s;e,</HI> however, that the Champion &s;hould prove too hard for them all, and not only <Q>heartily belabour the <HI>Knight</HI>'s Ribs,</Q> but al&s;o give his <HI>Va&s;&s;als</HI> and <HI>Attendants</HI> a "&s;ound Drubbing." <HI>Suppo&s;e</HI> then, that as they were afraid to venture to attack the Champion again, and yet were determined on his De&s;truction, that the <HI>Haberda&s;her</HI> might be gratified in his De&s;ires, they &s;hould

<P>HAVING now done with our Author, and as I am not the lea&s;t de&s;irous of &s;taying longer in his Company than is nece&s;&s;ary for his Cha&s;ti&s;ement, I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s him with this Advice of <HI>Sancho</HI>'s, viz. <Q>Let every Man take Care how he <HI>&s;peaks</HI> or <HI>writes</HI> of <HI>hone&s;t People,</HI> and not &s;et down at a Venture the fir&s;t Thing that comes into his <HI>Jolterhead.</HI></Q> &mdash;But perhaps he may look upon me as an Enemy, and not regard the Council, nor whole&s;ome Cor|rection, I have be&s;tow'd upon him.

<P>AND now, tremendous Sir! having thus exhorted your <HI>Squire,</HI> be plea&s;ed to accept of a little cordial Admonition for your&s;elf: Part of which &s;hall be another Extract from the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Don Quixote,</HI> a Work I am va&s;tly plea&s;ed to &s;ee quoted by your <HI>Squire,</HI> as it gives me an Opportunity (as I profe&s;s <HI>Imitation</HI>) of quoting it likewi&s;e. It is indeed a favourite Book with me, and I don't care how often in the Cour&s;e of our Di&s;putes I may be referred to a Work of &s;uch infinite Wit and Humour. It contains be&s;ides a va&s;t Fund of &s;erious In&s;truction, and I heartily advi&s;e you to endeavour to de&s;erve the Character which <HI>Sancho</HI> has given of that renowned <HI>Knight;</HI> My <Q>Ma&s;ter (&s;ays he) has Nothing at all <HI>mi&s;chevious</HI> about him; on the contrary is <HI>as dull as a Beetle,</HI> and knows not what it is to <HI>harm</HI> Man, Woman, or Child, or to <HI>harbour the lea&s;t Malice,</HI> but <HI>&s;eeks to do good unto all Mankind:</HI> One of the Articles &s;tipulated between us was that I might <HI>talk</HI> as much as I plea&s;ed, <HI>provided</HI> it was not <HI>Scandal</HI> again&s;t my Neighbour.</Q> &mdash;Perhaps, Sir, you may think there will be no great Ob&s;tacle to your acquiring the <HI>Beetle</HI> Part of the Character, as Nature has already been &s;o very a&s;&s;i&s;tant, and therefore conclude, that it is not worth your while to attempt it, as no <HI>Merit</HI> would re&s;ult to you &s;hould you
<PB N="35" REF="010014_0018_0F7B9881AF2ED798" MS="y">
&s;ucceed in a Point of &s;o little Difficulty: But then you &s;hould likewi&s;e con&s;ider, that in attempting to de&s;erve the other Parts of the Character, you will then have <HI>Nature</HI> to <HI>combat with;</HI> and, con&s;equently, &s;hould Succe&s;s attend your Endeavours, you will <HI>merit</HI> and <HI>obtain</HI> the Reward of a <HI>good Con&s;cience!</HI> &mdash;and the <HI>&s;incere Applau&s;e</HI> of your <HI>Fellow-Citizens!</HI> Rewards (however <HI>light</HI> they may appear in your pre&s;ent E&s;timation) that would afford you more true heart-feeling Satisfaction, could you but once acquire them, than any you ever yet experienced! &mdash; or ever had any Idea of!</P>
<P>IT is, however, but equitable I &s;hould mention, that <HI>Sancho</HI> has gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ented his Ma&s;ter with regard to his <HI>Under&s;tanding;</HI> and indeed <HI>Squires</HI> are very apt to talk di&s;re&s;pectfully of their <HI>Knights</HI> behind their Backs, as is well known to be the Practice of the One you at pre&s;ent employ. The <HI>Don</HI> was really a Man of <HI>fine Sen&s;e</HI> and <HI>&s;trict Honour,</HI> and, could you but imitate him in the&s;e Re&s;pects, you would find that whatever Follies and Extravagancies you might at Times commit, would only excite <HI>Laughter,</HI> or <HI>Pity,</HI> in&s;tead of that <HI>Ridicule</HI> and <HI>Contempt</HI> you now &s;uffer.</P>
<P>BUT, to be "&s;erious," for the "Subject will admit" of it. &mdash;Experience has, I hope, by this Time, taught you the Truth of <HI>Plautus</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation,
