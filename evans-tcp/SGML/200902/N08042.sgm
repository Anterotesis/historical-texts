<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Knowledge of the Hi&s;tory of any Society is very nece&s;&s;ary to direct the Governors of it, how to conduct with Wi&s;dom, Uniformity and Ju&s;tice; and may be u&s;eful and entertaining to many Others.</P>
<P>At the De&s;ire of the Reverend Tru&s;tees of this Col|lege, in the Year <HI>1744,</HI> I compiled the Sub&s;tance of this Hi&s;tory, to that Time; which was read and ap|proved by them.&mdash;It was collected principally from the Records and original Papers; but &s;everal Circum|&s;tances, tending to &s;et the Whole in a clear Light, I received from &s;undry Gentlemen, who were contempo|rary with the Facts related; among which were &s;ome of the Founders of the College, with whom I was per|&s;onally acquainted in the Year <HI>1726.</HI></P>
<P>As my principal De&s;ign, in writing this Hi&s;tory, was to pre&s;erve the&s;e important Facts from Oblivion, and to tran&s;mit them down, for the U&s;e of Po&s;terity; I have confined my&s;elf to the proper Province of an Hi&s;torian; which is to give a ju&s;t and &s;imple Narra|tion of Facts, without inter&s;per&s;ing many Embelli&s;h|ments, Ob&s;ervations or Reflections; leaving them to be made by the judicious and candid Reader.</P>
<P>And &s;ince the Want of a certain and exact Know|ledge of &s;ome ancient Facts, has oftentimes been the Occa&s;ion of Controver&s;ies and Di&s;putes, I have been more minute in the Relation of &s;ome Circum&s;tantials, than may probably be entertaining to Strangers; yet not more than may, hereafter, be really nece&s;&s;ary, for tho&s;e who will be immediately concerned.</P>
<P><PB REF="010262_0003_0F7E250FF8E29770">I have dige&s;ted this Hi&s;tory in the Form of <HI>ANNALS,</HI> as &s;uppo&s;ing that the chronological Order will be mo&s;t ea&s;ily under&s;tood and remembered: Yet, &s;ometimes, where Things are nece&s;&s;arily connected, I have put them into the &s;ame Paragraph, altho' they occurred in different Years.</P>
<P>The greater Part of this Hi&s;tory being wrote when the Paper-Currency of <HI>New-England</HI> was in a de|preciating State, it was thought be&s;t that all Sums of Money &s;hould be reduced to the <HI>Sterling</HI> Value. &mdash; The College-Accounts, before the Year <HI>1726,</HI> are &s;omewhat ob&s;cure; and therefore it is probable that &s;ome Receipts and Di&s;bur&s;ements of Money, before that Time, have not come to my Knowledge; yet, &s;ince that Time, they &s;tand very fair and clear.</P>
<P>To render this Hi&s;tory the more complete, I have recited or referred to all the Acts of the Honorable the General A&s;&s;embly, relating to the College.</P>
<P>I had Thoughts of adding &s;omething upon the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical Privileges of Colleges and Univer&s;i|ties, but &s;hall only refer the Reader to tho&s;e Authors who have wrote largely on that Subject, <HI>viz.</HI> &mdash; Dr. <HI>Ayliffe</HI>'s ancient and pre&s;ent State of the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford; Wood</HI>'s In&s;titutes of the common Law; Bp. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Lords; <HI>Conringius,</HI> de Antiquitatibus Academicis; and a &s;hort Piece I printed, in the Year <HI>1754,</HI> entitled <HI>The Religious Con&s;titution of Colleges.</HI></P>
<P>I have made Minutes of &s;everal other Things, which may be u&s;eful to Some; and may hereafter pre|pare Materials for the Continuation of this Hi&s;tory.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1698</NOTE>The De&s;ign of founding a College in the Colony of Connecticut, was fir&s;t concerted by the Mini&s;ters; among which the Rev.

<P>The Mini&s;ters &s;o nominated, met at <HI>New-Haven</HI> and formed them&s;elves into a Body or Society,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1700</NOTE> to con&s;i&s;t of eleven Mini&s;ters, including a Rector, and agreed to Found a College in the Colony of Connecticut; which they did at their next Meeting at <HI>Branford,</HI> in the fol|lowing Manner, viz.

Mr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> of <HI>Branford</HI> to be the Keeper of the Library, which then con&s;i&s;ted of about 40 Volumes in Folio. Soon after they received &s;undry other Donations both of Books and
<PB N="4" REF="010262_0007_0F7E2512C9C03740">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1700</NOTE>Money, which laid a good Foundation. This Library with the Additions, was kept at <HI>Branford,</HI> in a Room &s;et apart for that Purpo&s;e near three Years, and then it was carried to <HI>Killingworth.</HI></P>
<P>But afterwards &s;ome began to doubt whether they were fully ve&s;ted with a legal Capacity to hold Lands, and whether private Donations and Contributions would yield a Sufficiency to carry on &s;o great a De&s;ign; it was therefore propo&s;ed to make Application to the Hon. the General A&s;&s;embly of the Colony for &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and to a&s;k for a <HI>Charter.</HI> The Expediency of this Propo|&s;al was debated at &s;everal Meetings; and &s;undry Argu|ments were u&s;ed on both Sides: and &s;ome of the able&s;t Lawyers both in, and out of the Government, were con&s;ulted upon it. After mature Con&s;ideration, they concluded that it was &s;afe and be&s;t to have a Charter, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1701</NOTE>notwith&s;tanding any Change of the Government which might po&s;&s;ibly happen; and wrote to the Hon. Judge <HI>Sewall,</HI> and Mr. Secretary <HI>Addington</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> to prepare a Draught of a Charter, to be pre&s;ented to the next A&s;|&s;embly.</P>
<P>Whereupon a large Number of Mini&s;ters and others, drew up and &s;igned a Petition to the Hon. the General A&s;&s;embly, repre&s;enting, <Q>That from a &s;incere Regard to, and Zeal for, upholding the Prote&s;tant Religion, by a Succe&s;&s;ion of learned and orthodox Men, they had propo&s;ed that a Collegiate School &s;hould be erect|ed in this Colony, wherein Youth &s;hould be in&s;tructed in all Parts of Learning, to qualify them for publick Employments in Church and Civil State; and that they had nominated ten Mini&s;ters to be Tru&s;tees, Part|ners or Undertakers for the Founding, Endowing and Ordering the &s;aid School, viz. The Rev. Mr. <HI>James Noyes,</HI> Mr. <HI>I&s;rael Chauncy</HI> and the re&s;t before mentioned And thereupon de&s;ired that <HI>full</HI> Liberty and Privilege might be granted to the &s;aid Underta|kers for that End.</Q></P>

<P>The Tru&s;tees cho&s;e the Rev. Mr. Abraham Pier&s;on, who was one of their Number, to take the Care of In&s;tructing and Governing the Collegiate School; un|der the Title and Character of RECTOR.</P>

<P>At the &s;ame Meeting, they entered upon the Con&s;ide|ration of the mo&s;t convenient <HI>Place</HI> in the Colony of Connecticut, in which they might erect and fix the Collegiate School: they were not perfectly &s;atisfied or united in it; but after a con&s;iderable Debate they fixed upon <HI>Saybrook,</HI> as the mo&s;t convenient Place, <HI>at Pre&s;ent; unle&s;s upon further Con&s;ideration they &s;hould alter their Minds:</HI> And this Matter was debated at &s;everal Meet|ings afterwards.</P>

So that in a Year or two &s;ome were qua|lified for Degrees.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Commencement was held at Saybrook, on Sept. 13th, 1702. at which four young Gentlemen, who had before been graduated at the College at Cam|bridge, and one more, who had a private Education, received the Degrees of Ma&s;ter of Arts. This and &s;e|veral Commencements following were held privately in the Hou&s;e of the Rev. Mr. Buckingham, becau&s;e the Tru&s;tees by a preceding Act, had forbid all publick Commencements; to avoid the Charge and other In|conveniences attending them.</P>
<P>Mr. Nathaniel Lynde of Saybrook, was plea&s;ed ge|nerou&s;ly to give a Hou&s;e and Land for the U&s;e of the Collegiate School, &s;o long as it &s;hould be continued at <HI>Saybrook.</HI> And James Fitch, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in pur&s;uance of his generous Donation made in October la&s;t, gave an ample Deed of 637 Acres of Land at Killingly.

<P>The Tru&s;tees had a &s;pecial Meeting at <HI>Guilford,</HI> March 17th, 1703, and wrote a Circular Letter to the Mini&s;ters, propo&s;ing "to have a general Synod of all the Churches in the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> to give their joint Con&s;ent to

This Propo&s;al being univer&s;ally ac|ceptable, the Churches in the &s;everal Counties met in a con&s;ociated Council, and a&s;&s;ented to the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> or <HI>Savoy</HI> Confe&s;&s;ions; and drew up &s;ome Rules of Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline; as Matters preparatory to the Synod.

<P>He was educated at Harvard College and graduated there Anno. 1668; was a hard Student, a good Scho|lar, a great Divine, and a wi&s;e, &s;teady and judicious Gentleman in all his Conduct: He was for many Years a faithful and well re&s;pected Pa&s;tor of the Church in Killingworth, and after he was cho&s;en Rector, he in&s;tructed and governed the Infant College with gene|ral Approbation; and compo&s;ed a Sy&s;tem of Natural Philo&s;ophy, which the Students recited for many Years.</P>
<P>Upon the Death of Mr. Rector Pier&s;on, the Rev.

In this ob&s;cure State the College continued at <HI>Saybrook</HI> about &s;even Years, without any remarkable Occurrent or Alteration. And the Tru&s;|tees not being fully agreed or &s;atisfied in their own Minds about the Place of the College; and their In|comes being &s;carce &s;ufficient to &s;ettle and &s;upport a Re&s;ident Rector; they made no con&s;iderable Attempts to procure one in all that &s;pace of Time.</P>

<P><PB N="22" REF="010262_0025_0F7E2521727CCE00">The Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned by the Tru&s;tees in their Votes (and other Papers) for &s;ettling the College at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> were the&s;e; the Difficulty of keeping it at <HI>Saybrook,</HI> which aro&s;e partly from the Unea&s;ine&s;s of the Scholars, partly from the continual Endeavours of &s;ome to carry it to <HI>Hartford,</HI> which they &s;uppo&s;ed to be at too great a Di&s;tance from the Sea, and would no ways accommodate the We&s;tern Colonies. That they look'd upon <HI>New-Haven</HI> to be in it&s;elf the mo&s;t convenient Place, on the Account of the commodi|ou&s;ne&s;s of its Situation, the agreablene&s;s of the Air and Soil, and the Cheapne&s;s of Commodities; and that very large Donations had been made towards the Building an Hou&s;e there, without which they had not &s;ufficient to defray the Charge.</P>
<P>The Major Part of the General A&s;&s;embly, being de&s;irous to &s;trengthen the Hands of the Tru&s;tees in the pre&s;ent Difficulties, pa&s;t the following Vote, in the &s;ame Se&s;&s;ion, viz. <Q>That under the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of the Affairs of the Collegiate School, the Rev. Tru&s;tees be advi&s;ed to proceed in that Affair; and to fini&s;h the Hou&s;e they have built in <HI>New-Haven,</HI> for the Entertainment of the Scholars belonging to the Collegiate School.</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Votes of the Tru&s;tees and the General A&s;&s;embly, &s;ome Gentlemen &s;till pur&s;ued their De&s;ign of carrying the College to <HI>Weathersfield,</HI> and therefore encouraged the Scholars there, which were about 14 in Number,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1718</NOTE> to continue there: and in May following they again moved the Affair to the General A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Hartford.</HI> The lower Hou&s;e voted, <Q>to de&s;ire the Tru&s;tees, to Con&s;ent that the Commencements &s;hould be held alternately at <HI>Wea|thersfield</HI> and <HI>New-Haven,</HI> till the Place of the School be fully determined.</Q> The Upper Hou&s;e were of
<PB N="23" REF="010262_0026_0F7E252212CB1C88">
Opinion that the Place of the <Q>School was fully determined already, by the indi&s;putable Votes of the Tru&s;tees, and the &s;ub&s;equent Advice of the A&s;&s;em|bly thereupon;</Q> and therefore did not concur.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently after this, the Collegiate School at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> received &s;undry very large and generous Dona|tions; (which were very acceptable at this difficult Time.) The greate&s;t of which was from the Hon|orable ELIHU YALE, of <HI>London,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Governor of the Ea&s;t-India Company. He was Heir to a Manor in <HI>Wales,</HI> of the Value of 500 Pounds Sterling per Annum, be&s;ides the va&s;t Trea&s;ures he got by his per|&s;onal Indu&s;try while he was in the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> The paternal E&s;tate (as it was &s;aid) being entailed to the Male Heir of the Family, and he, having no Son, but three Daughters, &s;ent to his fir&s;t Cou&s;in and next Male Heir Mr. <HI>John Yale</HI> of <HI>New-Haven,</HI> with whom he had been formerly acquainted in <HI>England,</HI> to &s;end him one of his Sons, to inherit the paternal E&s;tate. Accord|ingly in the Year 1712, he &s;ent his Son Mr. <HI>David Yale,</HI> to London, who upon his Return was graduated at this College 1724.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things brought Governor YALE into Cor|re&s;pondence with the Honorable Governor <HI>Salton&s;tall</HI> and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Pierpont</HI> of <HI>New-Haven,</HI> which was the Occa&s;ion of his generous Donations. In the Year 1714 he &s;ent 40 Volumes of Books in Mr. <HI>Dummer's</HI> Collection. La&s;t Year he &s;ent above 300 Volumes, both which Parcels I &s;uppo&s;e to be worth 100 Pounds Sterling. This Summer he &s;ent Goods to the Value of 200 Pounds Sterling at prime Co&s;t, be&s;ides the King's Picture and Arms; with &s;ome Intimations that he would yet add; and accordingly three Years after, he &s;ent to the Value of 100 Pounds more; both which
<PB N="24" REF="010262_0027_0F7E252333F66DE0">
Parcels were &s;old here for an Equivalent to 400 Pounds Sterling.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dummer</HI> at this Time al&s;o &s;ent 76 Volumes of Books, whereof 20 were Folios, in Value about 30 Pounds Sterling. The Honorable <HI>Gurdon Salton&s;tall,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and <HI>Jahaleel Brenton,</HI> of Newport, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> gave, each of them, 50 Pounds Sterling.</P>
<P>Upon the Receipt of the&s;e and other large Donati|ons, the Circum&s;tances of the Collegiate School were very much altered for the better, and the Tru&s;tees were now well enabled to fini&s;h the large and com|modious College Hou&s;e, which they had before erected; it was rai&s;ed on the 8th Day of October 1717, and within a Year after was &s;o far fini&s;hed, as to be fit for the commodious Reception of the Students. It was 170 Feet long, 22 Feet wide, and 3 Story high; made a hand&s;ome Appearance, and contained near 50 Studies in convenient Chambers, be&s;ides the Hall, Library and Kitchin, and Co&s;t about 1000 Pounds Sterling.</P>
<P>On September 12, 1718, there was a &s;plendid Com|mencement held at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> where were pre&s;ent, be&s;ides the Tru&s;tees, the Honorable GURDON SAL|TONSTALL, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Governor of the Colony of <HI>Connec|ticut,</HI> the Honorable <HI>William Taylor,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> as repre|&s;enting <HI>Governor Yale,</HI> the Honorable <HI>Nathan Gold,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Deputy Governor, &s;undry of the wor&s;hipful A&s;|&s;i&s;tants, the Judges of the Circuit, a great Number of Rev. Mini&s;ters, and a great Concour&s;e of Spectators.</P>
<P>The Tru&s;tees, in Commemoration of <HI>Governor Yale</HI>'s great Genero&s;ity, called the Collegiate School, after his Name, YALE-COLLEGE; and entred a Memorial thereof upon Record, which is as follows.</P>

<P>On the Commencement Day Morning, this Monu|ment both of Genero&s;ity and Gratitude was with &s;olemn Pomp read off in the College Hall, both in Latin and Engli&s;h; then the Proce&s;&s;ion moved to the Meeting-Hou&s;e, to attend the Publick Exerci&s;es of the Day: Wherein, be&s;ides the Oration made by one of the Bachelors, the Rev. Mr. <HI>John Davenport,</HI> one of the Tru&s;tees, at the De&s;ire of the Body, made a florid Oration, wherein he largely in&s;i&s;ted upon and highly extolled the Genero&s;ity of <HI>Governor Yale.</HI> Eight Can|didates received the Honour of a Degree of Bachelor of Arts; and &s;everal more were created Ma&s;ters.

happy State of the College, in being &s;ixed at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and enrich'd with &s;o many noble Bene|factions; and particularly celebrated the great Gene|ro&s;ity of <HI>Governor Yale,</HI> with much Re&s;pect and Honour.</P>
<P>After this the Tru&s;tees &s;ent a very Complai&s;ant Let|ter of Thanks to Governor <HI>Yale;</HI> and gave him a particular Account of all the Tran&s;actions at the Com|mencement. They al&s;o &s;ent a Letter of Thanks to their great Friend and Patron <HI>Jeremiah Dummer,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for his late Donation of Books; and another to the Honorable General <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> for his Donation of Books in Mr. <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Collection; and for a late Donation, the Number or Value of which I can't find.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame Day upon which the Commencement was carried on at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> &s;omething like a Com|mencement was carried on at <HI>Weathersfield,</HI> before a large Number of Spectators; five Scholars, who were originally of the Cla&s;s, which now took their Degrees at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> performed publick Exerci&s;es; the Rev. Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> acted as Moderator; and he and Mr. <HI>Buckingham</HI> and other Mini&s;ters pre&s;ent &s;igned Certifi|cates, that they judged them to be worthy of the Degree of Bachelor of Arts; the&s;e Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> delivered to them in a formal Manner in the Meet|ing-Hou&s;e; which was commonly taken and repre|&s;ented as giving them their Degrees.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this Irregularity, which wi&s;e and good Men fell into in a Time of Strife and Tempta|tion; yet the Tru&s;tees were di&s;po&s;ed to conde&s;cend, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to gain and reconcile tho&s;e who had withdrawn from them; and therefore ordered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 13.</NOTE> <Q>that if any of tho&s;e Five Scholars &s;hould produce to the Rector, a Te&s;timony under the Hands of any two

Tru&s;tees, of their having been approved by them, as qualified for a Degree, the Rector upon ea&s;y and rea&s;onable Terms, &s;hould give them a Diploma in the u&s;ual Form, and that their Names &s;hould be in&s;erted in the Cla&s;s, as they were at fir&s;t placed;</Q>
which was done accordingly. They al&s;o directed the re&s;t of the Scholars remaining at <HI>Weathersfield</HI> to come to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and paid for their Tuition while they were there.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 9.</NOTE>The General A&s;&s;embly in October following, <Q>in Order to quiet the Minds of People, and introduce a general Harmony in the Publick Affairs, ordered that a <HI>State Hou&s;e</HI> &s;hould be built at <HI>Hartford,</HI> to compen&s;ate for the College at <HI>New-Haven;</HI> that 25 Pounds Sterling &s;hould be given to <HI>Saybrook</HI> for the U&s;e of the School, to compen&s;ate for the Removal of the College: That the Governor and Council &s;hould, at the De&s;ire of the Tru&s;tees, give &s;uch Orders as they &s;hould think proper for the Remo|val of the Library from <HI>Saybrook</HI> to <HI>New-Haven:</HI> That the Scholars at <HI>Weathersfield,</HI> &s;hould go to <HI>New-Haven;</HI> and the College &s;hould be carried on, promoted and encouraged at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and all due Care taken for its flouri&s;hing.</Q></P>
<P>In December following the Governor and Council, at the De&s;ire of the Tru&s;tees, met at <HI>Saybrook;</HI> and gave a Warrant to the Sheriff, to deliver the Books to the Tru&s;tees. The Hou&s;e where the Books were, was filled and &s;urrounded with a great Number of Men, who were determined to prevent the Removal of the Books; and therefore re&s;i&s;ted the Officer: But he, with his Attendants, broke open the Door, and delivered the Books to the Tru&s;tees, or their
<PB N="29" REF="010262_0032_0F7E4865A9988770">
Order; and &s;o they were conveyed to <HI>New-Haven.</HI> But in this Tumult and Confu&s;ion, about 250 of the mo&s;t valuable Books, and &s;undry Papers of Impor|tance were conveyed away by unknown Hands, and never could be found again.</P>
<P>After this unhappy Struggle, the Spirits of Men began, by Degrees to &s;ub&s;ide; and a general Har|mony was gradually introduced among the Tru&s;tees, and the Colony in general. The Rev. Mr. <HI>Wood|bridge</HI> and Mr. <HI>Buckingham</HI> became very friendly to the College at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and forward to promote all its Intere&s;ts. The Tru&s;tees, in Te&s;timony of their Friend&s;hip and Regard to Mr. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> cho&s;e him <HI>Rector pro Tempore;</HI> and he accordingly moderated and gave Degrees at the Commencement Anno 1723. Yet in this Time of Anarchy and Confu&s;ion, while all College Order and Authority was in a Manner di&s;&s;olved, the Scholars contracted &s;uch licentious and vicious Habits, as were not wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and extirpated out of the College in &s;everal Years.</P>
<P>Governor <HI>Yale,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1721</NOTE> the great Benefactor to this Col|lege died July 8th, 1721. He de&s;cended from an ancient and wealthy Family in <HI>Wales;</HI> who for many Generations po&s;&s;e&s;t the Manor of <HI>Plas Grannow,</HI> and &s;everal other Me&s;&s;uages, near the City of <HI>Wrexham,</HI> of the yearly Value of 500 Pounds. <HI>Thomas Yale,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the Governor's Father, for the Sake of Religion, came over to <HI>America</HI> with the fir&s;t Settlers of <HI>New-Haven,</HI> in the Year 1638. Here the Governor was born, April 5, 1648. He went to <HI>England</HI> at the Age of about 10 Years; to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> at about 30, where he lived near 20 Years; acquired a very great E&s;tate, was made Governor of Fort <HI>St. George;</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="010262_0033_0F7E48666EFB2538">
married an Indian-Lady of Fortune, the Relict of Governor <HI>Hinmers,</HI> his Predece&s;&s;or; by whom he had three Daughters; viz. <HI>Katharine,</HI> who was afterwards married to <HI>Dudley North,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> commonly called <HI>Lord North. Ann,</HI> who was married to the Lord <HI>James Cavendi&s;h,</HI> Uncle to the Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire.</HI> And <HI>Ur&s;ula,</HI> who died unmarried. After his Return to <HI>London,</HI> he was cho&s;en Governor of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company; and made the Donations beforementioned. And it is &s;aid, that a little before his Death, he wrote his Will, wherein he gave 500 Pounds more: But afterwards, thinking it was be&s;t to execute that Part of his Will in his Life-time, he packed up Goods to that Value, ready to be &s;ent; but before they were &s;hipped, he took a Journey into <HI>Wales,</HI> and died at <HI>Wrexham,</HI> in or near the Seat of his Ance&s;tors. So that the Goods were not &s;ent; neither could the Will obtain a <HI>Probate;</HI> altho' Governor <HI>Salton&s;tall</HI> took much Pains to effect it.</P>
<P>He was a Gentleman, who greatly abounded in good Humour and Genero&s;ity, as well as in Wealth: And his Name and Memory will be gratefully per|petuated in YALE-COLLEGE.</P>
<P>After the College was fixed at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> was enriched with &s;undry noble Benefactions, and had a hand&s;ome and commodious Hou&s;e built for the Re|ception of the Students, it began to flouri&s;h; and was much more taken Notice of in the World, than it was in its more ob&s;cure State at <HI>Saybrook.</HI> The Number of the Students was now about 40, who were under two Tutors, and &s;ometimes vi&s;ited by Mr. <HI>Andrew,</HI> Rector pro Tempore. But yet the Col|lege was under great Inconveniencies both with Re|&s;pect to Government and In&s;truction, for want of a Re&s;ident Rector.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="010262_0034_0F7E486725D9AE98">The Tru&s;tees therefore met at New-Haven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1719</NOTE> in March 1719, and cho&s;e the Rev.

He pre&s;ently came to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and entred upon the Bu&s;ine&s;s. At the next Commencement the Tru&s;tees voted, <Q>that Mr. Cutler's Service hitherto in the Place of a Rector was to their good Satisfaction, and therefore they de&s;ired him to continue in it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1720</NOTE></Q> And after &s;everal Conferences with, and Propo&s;als to the People at <HI>Stratford,</HI> it was finally agreed, that the People at <HI>Stratford</HI> &s;hould have Mr. <HI>Cutler</HI>'s Hou&s;e and Home-lot there, in Con&s;ideration of his Removal; and that the Tru&s;tees &s;hould give him 84 Pounds Sterling for it: Which was paid out of the 120 Pounds lately given by the General A&s;&s;embly, by the Sale of Lands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1721</NOTE></P>
<P>To accommodate the Rev.

<P>The College &s;eemed now to be in a &s;ettled and flouri&s;hing State, but there was a &s;udden and unex|pected Change; for at the next Commencement, it was di&s;covered, that the Rector, one of the Tutors, and two of the neighbouring Mini&s;ters had agreed to leave the Communion of the Churches in the Co|lony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and to go to <HI>England</HI> for epi&s;|copal Ordination.

The Committee went to <HI>Windham</HI> on the 10th of November; having given previous Notice of their coming and De&s;ign. The Generality of the People could not be &s;atisfied that it was their Duty to part with their Mini&s;ter, on this Occa&s;ion; on the other Hand they were not &s;atisfied that they &s;hould be in the Way of their Duty to oppo&s;e his going; &s;o that after a con&s;idera|ble Debate, they did little or nothing, but left the whole Affair to the Conduct of Providence.</P>
<P>The Committee moved for the calling of a Coun|cil of the Churches in the County, to advi&s;e in this important Affair; who after a publick Hearing of the Objections, which &s;ome of the People made again&s;t his Removal, gave it as their Opinion and Advice, <Q>That it was Mr. <HI>Clap</HI>'s Duty to accept of the Of|fice of Rector of the College, as being a Call of Providence, to greater and more exten&s;ive U&s;eful|ne&s;s.</Q> The Committee of the Tru&s;tees con&s;idering the great Inconveniencies which the College had for|merly &s;u&s;tained by the long Intervals in which it was de&s;titute of a re&s;ident Rector, urged Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> to be &s;peedy in accepting and undertaking the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s: Whereupon he concluded to accept of it, as a Call of Providence; and accordingly in December made a Vi&s;it to the College.</P>

Then they went into the Hall; the Rev. Mr. <HI>Whitman,</HI> the Moderator began with Prayer; and one of the Students made an Oration proper for the Oc|ca&s;ion; then the Moderator made a Speech, in Latin, wherein he committed the Care of in&s;tructing and governing the College to the Rector; and <HI>he</HI> con|cluded the whole with an Oration.</P>
<P>The Tru&s;tees met at <HI>Hartford</HI> in May following; and the Committee of the fir&s;t Society in <HI>Windham,</HI> moved that they might have Recompence for the Removal of their Pa&s;tor; they mutually agreed to re|fer it to three Gentlemen of the General A&s;&s;embly, to con&s;ider what Recompence they ought to have; tho&s;e Gentlemen were of Opinion, that ina&s;much as Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> had been in the Mini&s;try at <HI>Windham</HI> 14 Years, which was about Half the Time Mini&s;ters in general continue in their publick Work; the People ought to have Half &s;o much as they gave him for a Settlement, which upon Computation was about 53 Pounds Sterling. Whereupon the Tru&s;tees put in a Memorial to the General A&s;&s;embly, praying them to grant that Sum to the People of <HI>Windham;</HI> which they readily did.</P>
<P>The College was now, in the main, in a good State; yet not &s;o perfect, but that it would admit of &s;undry Emendations. The Rector therefore endea|voured by all Ways and Means in his Power, to bring it forward towards a State of Perfection. The

fir&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;pecial Importance, which he entered upon, was the compiling a Body of Laws. At the fir&s;t founding of this College, it was ordered, that where no &s;pecial Provi&s;ion was made by the Tru&s;tees, the Laws of <HI>Harvard-College</HI> &s;hould be the Rule. About the Time the College was fixed at <HI>New-Ha|ven,</HI> a &s;hort Body of Laws was drawn up, which was u&s;ually tran&s;cribed by the Scholars at their Ad|mi&s;&s;ion; but the&s;e, in Time, were found to be very defective; and &s;everal of them became ob&s;olete. In the Year 1735, the Tru&s;tees appointed a Committee with the Rector, to draw up a new Body; but he, being in a declining State of Health, did little or nothing upon it. As &s;oon therefore as Rector <HI>Clap</HI> was fixed in his Po&s;t, the Tru&s;tees de&s;ired him to enter upon the Bu&s;ine&s;s; accordingly a large Body was drawn up, partly out of the ancient Laws and Statutes of this College, partly from the principal and mo&s;t important Cu&s;toms which had obtained, partly from the Laws of <HI>Harvard</HI> College, and partly from the Statutes of the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford;</HI> and &s;ome few new ones were added. This Body was pe|ru&s;ed by a Committee, then by mo&s;t of their Mem|bers at their own Homes, and after &s;everal Readings at the Tru&s;tee's Board, pa&s;&s;ed their Sanction in 1745. The&s;e Laws were afterwards tran&s;lated into Latin and printed in 1748: And &s;ome Additions have been made &s;ince, with &s;everal new Editions.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame Time the Rector collected and wrote down, under proper Heads, all the <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> of College, which had from Time to Time obtained and been e&s;tabli&s;hed by Practice, which made as large a Volume as the Statutes. By all which Means, the Rules by which the Officers and Students of the Col|lege were to conduct them&s;elves, became better fixed

<P>Before this Time there never had been any perfect Catalogue of the Books in the Library;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1742</NOTE> for want of which the Students were deprived of much of the Benefit and Advantage of them.

By which Means it might be ea&s;ily known what Books were in the Library upon any particular Subject, and where they might be found, with the utmo&s;t Expedition. This Catalogue was printed, and was a great Incite|ment to the Diligence and Indu&s;try of the Scholars in reading of them. About the &s;ame Time the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly augmented their annual Grant to the College, whereby they were enabled to &s;upport three Tutors, one to each Cla&s;s, including the Rector. This removed a great Inconveniency which the College had before been under by one Tutor's hearing two Cla&s;|&s;es, and &s;ometimes more. And thereupon the Scho|lars &s;tudied and recited much more than they had done in Years pa&s;t.</P>

The Executors paid the Ten Pounds to the Tru&s;tees, but being informed that there was a large Debt due from the E&s;tate, in <HI>En|gland,</HI> paid nothing to the graduated Mini&s;ters; and they living at a great Di&s;tance, and &s;ome Difficulties intervening, did nothing further in many Years. In the mean Time many of the young Mini&s;ters grew unea&s;y, and ventured to &s;ell &s;ome of the Lands, tho' none of them had any Authority to &s;ell; and the greater Part had no Right to the Money, becau&s;e, as the Lands were apprai&s;ed in the Inventory, the Money would all be run out, before it came to them. And other Per&s;ons, who had no Pretence of Right, got into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of the Lands, and kept them &s;o long as to claim them by Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. And it appeared that Mr. <HI>Lambert</HI> was cheated in &s;ome Parcels, becau&s;e the Per&s;ons who &s;old them to him, had no Right. The Pre&s;ident being unwilling that the E&s;tate &s;hould be lo&s;t, as to the End for which it was given, &s;et up a Notification in the Hall at the Commencement 1744, de&s;iring tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who had any Intere&s;t, to meet and con&s;ult upon it. They met and cho&s;e a Committee to Manage the Affair; but they found it attended with &s;o many Difficulties that they could not do it, to any Advantage; and therefore agreed to re&s;ign it up to the Pre&s;ident and Fellows; who would be under a better Capacity to
<PB N="54" REF="010262_0057_0F7E488168F6ADD8">
manage it. Accordingly mo&s;t of tho&s;e who were &s;uppo&s;ed to have any Intere&s;t, freely re&s;igned it up to the Pre&s;ident and Fellows, to be improved for the Benefit of the College, in &s;uch a Manner as they &s;hould think be&s;t; and the re&s;t of the Rights were purcha&s;ed. And the Executors gave to the Pre&s;ident and Fellows a Deed of all the Lands of which Mr. <HI>Lambert</HI> died &s;eized; whereupon with con&s;iderable Pains and Expence, they became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of about an Hundred Acres of Land in <HI>Wallingford,</HI> and Sixty Two Acres, lying in five Parcels, in <HI>New-Haven;</HI> exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e &s;old by the young Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>The Honorable <HI>Phillip Livingston,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of his Maje&s;ty's Council for the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> hav|ing had four Sons educated at this College, was plea&s;ed generou&s;ly to be&s;tow Twenty Eight Pounds and Ten Shillings Sterling, to be put out to Intere&s;t, and the Intere&s;t to be appropriated for the Support of a <HI>Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity,</HI> or to any other U&s;e the Pre&s;ident and Fellows &s;hould think to be mo&s;t for the Advantage of the College.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1748</NOTE>The Number of Students being about One Hun|dred and Twenty, more than half of them were oblig|ed, for want of Room, to live out of the College; which was upon many Accounts inconvenient.

And the Corporation being de&s;i|rous to put the Lands under &s;ome profitable Im|provement, more e&s;pecially for maintaining a Profe&s;|&s;or of Divinity; the Pre&s;ident projected the follow|ing Scheme, viz. that the Lands &s;hould be lea&s;ed for the Term of 999 Years; the Rent to be the In|tere&s;t of the pre&s;ent Value of the Lands, at 5 per <HI>Centum;</HI> to be forfeited in Ca&s;e of non Payment of the Rent, at the annual Times appointed, but re|deemable within Six Months after, upon Payment of the Rent, with lawful Intere&s;t upon it. This Me|thod of Lea&s;ing appeared upon all Accounts, to be the mo&s;t Advantageous both for Landlord and Te|nant. The Rents were &s;ecured to the College in the be&s;t Manner, and they were free from the Trou|ble and Charge of In&s;pection and Reparation. And the Tenants had all po&s;&s;ible Encouragement to cul|tivate and improve the Lands, as their own.

<P>The College was in an agreeable and happy State, in mo&s;t Re&s;pects, but had for many Years been un|der, &s;ome Difficulties and Di&s;advantages with Re|gard to Religion.

<P N="1">1. That the Scriptures of the Old and New Te&s;|taments are the only Rule of Faith and Practice, in all Matters of Religion, and the Standard by which all Doctrines, Principles and Practices in Religion are to be tried and judged.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="5">5. That every Per&s;on who &s;hall hereafter be cho&s;en a Pre&s;ident, Fellow, Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity, or Tutor, in this College, &s;hall before he enters upon the Execution of his Office, publickly give his Con&s;ent to the &s;aid <HI>Catechi&s;m</HI> and <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith,</HI> as containing a ju&s;t Summary of the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion, as before expre&s;&s;ed; and renounce all Doc|trines or Principles contrary thereunto; and &s;hall pa&s;s through &s;uch an Examination as the Corpo|ration &s;hall think proper, in order to their being fully &s;atisfied that he &s;hall do it truly, without any Eva&s;ion or Equivocation.</P>

it is e&s;pecially declared, that if any Per&s;on &s;hall deny the Validity of the Ordination of the Mini&s;|ters of this Colony, commonly called <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> or <HI>Congregational,</HI> or &s;hall hold, that it is nece&s;|&s;ary or convenient that &s;uch Mini&s;ters &s;hould be re-ordained, in order to render their Admini&s;tra|tions <HI>valid,</HI> it &s;hall be deemed an e&s;&s;ential Depar|ture from our eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution; and incon|&s;i&s;tent with the Intentions of the Founders of this College, that &s;uch a Per&s;on &s;hould be cho&s;en an Officer in it.</P>

<P>In May 1763, nine Gentlemen preferred a Memo|rial to the Honorable the General A&s;&s;embly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1763</NOTE> wherein they repre&s;ented, that the General A&s;&s;embly were the <HI>Founders of the College;</HI> and as &s;uch, had right to appoint <HI>Vi&s;itors,</HI> to reform Abu&s;es if any were found. Which right the Memorali&s;ts &s;ugge&s;ted, ought to be &s;ea&s;onably, and mo&s;t explicitly vindicated and a&s;&s;erted: or otherwi&s;e the College might become too independent. And therefore prayed, that the &s;aid A&s;&s;embly, would pa&s;s an Act, to authorize an Appeal, from any and every Sentence given by the Authority of the Col|lege,
<PB N="70" REF="010262_0073_0F7E48920E3FB098">
to the Governor and Council of this Colony; for the Time being. And that the &s;aid A&s;&s;embly would immediately i&s;&s;ue forth a <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion of Vi&s;itation,</HI> enabling &s;ome &s;uitable Per&s;ons to inquire into all the Affairs of &s;aid College, and either of them&s;elves rec|tify all Abu&s;es, which they may di&s;cover; or make Report of what they &s;hall find, with their Opinions thereon, to the &s;aid A&s;&s;embly at their next Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Coun&s;el for the Memorali&s;ts alledged, that the General A&s;&s;embly <HI>founded</HI> the College by giving a Charter, in the Year 1701: which contained a Do|nation of about Sixty Pounds Sterling, to be annually paid out of the publick Trea&s;ury; and by &s;undry &s;ub&s;equent Donations, e&s;pecially five Tracts of Land in the Year 1732. And that the pre&s;ent A&s;&s;embly, as Succe&s;&s;ors to the Founders, had a right of Vi&s;itation, by the Common Law. They further alledged, that &s;uch an Appeal, and Vi&s;itation were very nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the good Order and Regulation of the College, upon all Accounts, and particularly to pre|&s;erve <HI>Orthodoxy</HI> in Religion.</P>
<P>To which the Pre&s;ident replied;</P>
<P>That the General A&s;&s;embly, in their Legi&s;lative Capacity, have the &s;ame Authority over the College, and all the Per&s;ons and E&s;tates belonging to it; as they have over all other Per&s;ons and E&s;tates in the Colony; and all that Power which is nece&s;&s;ary for the good of the College, or the general Good of the Community. And that an e&s;pecial Re&s;pect and Gratitude is due to them, as the <HI>greate&s;t Benefactors;</HI> yet they are not to be con&s;idered as <HI>Founders</HI> or <HI>Vi&s;i|tors</HI> in the Sen&s;e of the Common Law. That the <HI>first</HI> Tru&s;tees, Undertakers and In&s;pectors, who were nominated by the Mini&s;ters with the general Con&s;ent of the People, and by Compact, became a Society or

<HI>Qua&s;i Corporation</HI> (as my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> &s;ays) near two Years before they had a Charter, were the <HI>Founders</HI> of the College; and that they formed it, by making a large and formal Donation of Books; above a Year before they had a Charter from the Government. That the College had a Being, not only in <HI>fieri</HI> in the Purpo&s;e and Intention of the Undertakers (as Lord <HI>Coke</HI> &s;ays) <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coke 10 <HI>Rep.</HI></NOTE> but in <HI>e&s;&s;e</HI> by the Donation of Books, Money and Land actually made to it, before it <HI>had a Charter.

<P>When the fundamental Donation is made before the Licence to found, there the Licence is only a formal and explicit Confirmation from the Crown, of what was before done by the general Licence given by the Common and Statute Law; whereby every Man may give his E&s;tate, for publick, pious and cha|ritable U&s;es; upon &s;uch Conditions and Regulations, as he &s;hall &s;ee Cau&s;e. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>39</HI> Eliz.

And the Charter declares them to be in a legal Capacity to <Q>demand, have, hold, and po&s;&s;e&s;s all &s;uch Lands, Goods and Monies as have <HI>heretofore</HI> been given, (as well as tho&s;e which might hereafter be given) for the founding, erecting and endowing the &s;aid School.</Q></P>
<P>And there is no Intimation, that their giving to the fir&s;t Tru&s;tees, a Right to receive Sixty Pounds out of the publick Trea&s;ury, a Year after, and an|nually, and to improve it, at their Di&s;cretion, for the Good of the School, &s;hould be deemed the <HI>&s;ounding</HI> of it; to be &s;ure not in &s;uch a Sen&s;e as to annul the former Foundation; much le&s;s could any Endowments made thirty Years after, make them the Founders in the Sen&s;e of the Common Law.

<P>It was further ob&s;erved, that an <Q>Appeal from all and every Sentence given by the Authority of College; to the Governor and Council of this Colony, for the Time being,</Q> (as propo&s;ed in the Memorial,) would retard and ob&s;truct all the Proceedings of the Authority of College.

<PB N="74" REF="010262_0077_0F7E4894E0E97210">
of Appeal is allowed, the Judgment appealed from, is of no Force or Efficacy; except that which may ari&s;e from the extraordinary Trouble and Charge of bringing the Ca&s;e to a Trial, in the Court ap|pealed to. That &s;uch a Con&s;titution would take the Government of the College wholly out of the Hands of tho&s;e, in whom it was originally ve&s;ted; and be contrary to the Charter. That &s;uch a univer&s;al Li|berty of Appeals, e&s;pecially in criminal Ca&s;es, is not allowed in any Community what&s;oever; and that tho&s;e few Ca&s;es in which Appeals are allowed in &s;ome other Colleges, are under peculiar Conditions and Re&s;trictions.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o ob&s;erved that the Power of <HI>Vi&s;itation</HI> is, by the Common Law, expre&s;sly limited to the <HI>Statutes of the Founder;</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lord <HI>Raymond</HI>'s Reports, Vol. I. P. <HI>7.</HI></NOTE> which are the Conditions or Limitations of the U&s;e of the Founder's Dona|tion; and the Vi&s;itor can do nothing but rectify tho&s;e Things which are plainly repugnant to tho&s;e Limitations; or claim a Forfeiture. But as no &s;uch Statutes, made by the General A&s;&s;embly, can be found; &s;uch Vi&s;itors would have no Power at all, or be altogether arbitrary, like the Vi&s;itors &s;ent to <HI>Magdalen</HI> College, by King <HI>James</HI> II.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed, that there is any Need of any Over&s;eers, under the Name and Title of <HI>Vi&s;itors;</HI> the fir&s;t Tru&s;tees and their Succe&s;&s;ors, may properly be denominated &s;uch: And in the fir&s;t Plan of the College, they are expre&s;sly called <HI>In&s;pectors.</HI> That to have Vi&s;itors over Vi&s;itors or In&s;pectors, would make endle&s;s Trouble and Confu&s;ion. That Matters of Property mu&s;t be determined by the &s;tated, execu|tive Courts, according to the Cour&s;e of the Com|mon
<PB N="75" REF="010262_0078_0F7E48987471C418">
Law; but to erect any new Kind of Court over the Affairs of the College, which are committed to the Pre&s;ident and Fellows, would be an Infringement on their Charter. Though the General A&s;&s;embly &s;till retain &s;uch a &s;upreme Power, as that if there &s;hould be any plain <HI>Breach of Tru&s;t,</HI> cognizable by a <HI>Court of Chancery,</HI> or any &s;uch Mi&s;conduct in the Corpora|tion, as &s;hould be plainly detrimental to the pub|lick Good, they may rectify it in their legi&s;lative Capacity.</P>
<P>As to the Advantage of Vi&s;itors to pre&s;erve <HI>Or|thodoxy</HI> in the Governors of the College;</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident ob&s;erved, that whatever was the Oc|ca&s;ion, or De&s;ign of that Argument, he was glad that &s;uch an important Point was moved. That it was well known, that the Pre&s;ident and Fellows or Tru&s;tees have from the Beginning, &s;hewn a proper Care and Zeal to pre&s;erve Orthodoxy in all the Go|vernors of the College; and to &s;uch a Degree, as to be di&s;agreable to &s;ome Gentlemen of late; who have thereupon endeavoured to ob&s;truct the Government, and flouri&s;hing State of the College. That the Or|thodoxy of the College was &s;ettled and &s;ecured upon the be&s;t Foundation, that human Wi&s;dom, directed by the general Rules of God's Word, could devi&s;e. That according to the original De&s;ign of the Found|ing of the College, the Pre&s;ident, Fellows, Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity, and Tutors, are to be admitted upon Con|dition of their Con&s;ent to the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith,</HI> agreed upon by the Churches in the Colony, Anno 1708, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Laws of the Government. <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">See Anno <HI>1753.</HI></NOTE> That there is not the like Security of the Ortho|doxy of <HI>Vi&s;itors</HI> or any other in the civil Order,

And one principal Rea&s;on why they oppo&s;e all <HI>Innovations</HI> in the Con&s;titution and Government of the College, is, le&s;t they might hereafter, have an ill Influence upon the Orthodoxy of it; which the Pre&s;ident and Fellows, according to the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, by the Founders and by the General A&s;&s;embly, are fully determined to maintain and pre&s;erve to the Utmo&s;t of their Power.</P>
<P>When the&s;e Arguments were con&s;idered by the Honorable the General A&s;&s;embly, but very few ap|peared to be of the Opinion, that the A&s;&s;embly

were the <HI>Founders</HI> of the College; and &s;o they acted nothing upon the Memorial. And it is generally &s;up|po&s;ed that this Que&s;tion will never be publickly moved again.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. <HI>Jared Eliot,</HI> of <HI>Killingworth,</HI> in his la&s;t Will, gave Seven Pounds and Ten Shillings, Ster. to be put out to Intere&s;t; and the Intere&s;t thereof to be expended in purcha&s;ing Books for the Library from Time to Time, at the Di&s;cretion of the Pre|&s;ident and Fellows.</P>
<P>The Number of Students, for near ten Years pa&s;t being about 170, it became extremely inconvenient to carry on all religious and &s;chola&s;tick Exerci&s;es in the old <HI>College-Hall;</HI> and to make U&s;e of it for a Dining-Room.</P>
<P>The Library was al&s;o too &s;mall for the Books and Apparatus. The Pre&s;ident therefore propo&s;ed a Scheme to build a new <HI>Hall</HI> or <HI>Chapel,</HI> with a Li|brary over it: And &s;et forward a Sub&s;cription for that Purpo&s;e: the Foundation was laid in April 1761, and the Out&s;ide was nearly fini&s;hed that Summer: It is built of Brick, fifty Feet long, and forty Feet wide, with a Steeple and Galleries, in which are three Ro&s;tra for Orations, Di&s;putations, &amp;c. and a Library over the whole. It is &s;et near the South End of the Brick College, with a View that when another Col|lege is built, it will be &s;et near the South Side of the Chapel. In June 1763, it was opened with a Ser|mon preached by the Profe&s;&s;or, in the Pre&s;ence of the Pre&s;ident and Fellows, and a large Number of other Gentlemen. And the Pre&s;ident and Fellows voted, <Q>that the <HI>Chapel</HI> &s;hould hereafter be u&s;ed for the Religious and Schola&s;tick Meetings and Exerci&s;es,

<HEAD><HI>AN APPENDIX,</HI> Containing the pre&s;ent State of the College; the Method of In&s;truction and Government; and a Li&s;t of Officers, Be|nefactors and Graduates.</HEAD>
<P>THIS College is under the Government of a Pre&s;i|dent and ten Fellows; who are &s;ome of the prin|cipal Mini&s;ters, in the &s;everal Parts of the Colony: And ordinarily meet on the &s;econd Wedne&s;day in September, annually, and on &s;pecial Emergencies; to confer Degrees, &s;ettle the College Accounts, appoint &s;ubordinate Officers, make Laws, and direct in the general and more important Affairs of the College.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident has the principal Care and Bu&s;ine&s;s of in&s;tructing and governing the Students; with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity, and three Tu|tors. The Pre&s;ident every Morning and Evening, reads and expounds a Chapter in the Bible, and prays in the Chapel; at which all the Students are obliged to attend. After Evening Prayers, he fre|quently makes Di&s;&s;ertations upon various Subjects in Religion and Learning, and almo&s;t all the different Affairs and Employments of Life.</P>
<P>The Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity preaches Sermons in the Chapel, every Lord's-Day, in the Cour&s;e of a Body of Divinity, Doctrinal and Practical; and occa&s;ional
<PB N="81" REF="010262_0084_0F7E489C63331FA8">
Di&s;cour&s;es or Lectures, at other Times; and frequently gives private Coun&s;el and In&s;truction.</P>
<P>The Number of undergraduate Students, for many Years pa&s;t, has been about One Hundred and Se|venty; but by Rea&s;on of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Difficulties which the Country has been under, of late, the Number has been dimini&s;hed, for two or three Years pa&s;t. They are divided into four Cla&s;&s;es; according to the re&s;pective Years, in which they were admitted. Each Cla&s;s is under the immediate In&s;truction of a particular Tutor; who carries them thro' a Cour&s;e of Studies, for three Years; and the Pre&s;ident com|pletes their In&s;truction in the fourth. At their Ad|mi&s;&s;ion they are able well to con&s;true and par&s;e <HI>Tully</HI>'s Orations, <HI>Virgil</HI> and the <HI>Greek</HI> Te&s;tament; and under&s;tand the Rules of common Arithmetick. In the fir&s;t Year, they learn <HI>Hebrew;</HI> and principally pur&s;ue the Study of the Languages, and make a Beginning in Logick, and &s;ome Parts of the Ma|thematicks. In the &s;econd Year, they &s;tudy the Languages; but principally recite Logick, Rhetorick, Oratory, Geography and natural Philo&s;ophy: And &s;ome of them make good Proficiency in Trigono|metry and Algebra. In the third Year, they &s;till pur&s;ue the Study of natural Philo&s;ophy; and mo&s;t Branches of the Mathematicks: Many of them well under&s;tand Surveying, Navigation and the Calcula|tion of the Eclip&s;es; and &s;ome of them are con|&s;iderable Proficients in Conic Sections and Fluxions. In the fourth Year they principally &s;tudy and recite Metaphy&s;icks, Ethicks and Divinity. In reciting any Book upon the Arts and Sciences, the Tutor a&s;ks them Que&s;tions upon all the principal Points and Propo&s;itions in it; and they give &s;uch An&s;wers, as &s;hew whether they under&s;tand it; and the Tutor
<PB N="82" REF="010262_0085_0F7E489D4D0B0128">

<P>The two upper Cla&s;&s;es exerci&s;e their Powers in di&s;puting every Monday in the Syllogi&s;tick Form, and every Tue&s;day in the Foren&s;ick; which gives a grea|ter Scope to their Genius, and is better adapted to the common U&s;e and Practice of Mankind, in the Con|duct of publick Affairs. In the&s;e Di&s;putes we often hear a Summary of the be&s;t Arguments which can be produced out of any Author, on both Sides of a di&s;|puted Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>When they have alternately gone through all their Arguments, the Moderator recapitulates tho&s;e which &s;eem to be the mo&s;t plau&s;ible on each Side, &s;hews their real Force or Weakne&s;s, and gives his Opinion upon the Whole. The Que&s;tions are taken from every Subject, which occurs in the whole Circle of Litera|ture, and upon almo&s;t all the doubtful Points, which have been publickly di&s;puted among Mankind.</P>
<P>Twice a Week five or &s;ix deliver a Declamation memoriter from the oratorical Ro&s;trum; the Pre&s;i|dent makes &s;ome Ob&s;ervations upon the Manner of Delivery and &s;ometimes upon the Subject; and &s;ome|times gives &s;ome &s;mall Laurel to him who be&s;t acts the Part of an Orator. The&s;e Declamations are be|forehand &s;upervi&s;ed by their Tutor, who corrects the Othography and Punctuation. There are al&s;o two Orations made every Quarter-Day, upon Examina|tions, and frequently on &s;pecial Occa&s;ions. And to train them up to an agreable Stile and Method of Writing, the Pre&s;ident directs them, that when any one has Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;pecial Importance with him, they &s;hould make Application in the Form of a Letter.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="010262_0086_0F7E48A0A04955C8">Special Care is taken to form the Morals of the Youth; to keep them (as much as may be) from all Exce&s;&s;es and Extravagancies; from all vain Af|fectations of Show, which occa&s;ion unnece&s;&s;ary Ex|pences and divert their Minds from the Pur&s;uit of tho&s;e Things which are of greater Importance; to in&s;til into their Minds true Notions of Honor, Po|litene&s;s, and a Love of Virtue: And to impre&s;s upon them a Sen&s;e, that the End of their Creation, and of all their &s;pecial Advantages, is not ultimately for them&s;elves, or their own Sakes; but to qualify them for the &s;pecial Service of God; and to render them mo&s;t u&s;eful to their Fellow-Men.</P>
<P>Above all, Care is taken to in&s;til into their Minds, the Principles of true Religion, in Doctrine and Pra|tice, by publick and private Di&s;cour&s;es and per&s;onal Conver&s;ations. To this End they are obliged to attend the publick Wor&s;hip of God in the Chapel every Lord's-Day, and Morning and Evening Pray|ers; at which, Occa&s;ion is frequently taken, from the Portion of Scripture read, to excite them to &s;ome particular Duty, and to Caution them again&s;t &s;ome particular Sin.</P>
<P>The Sons of tho&s;e, who pro&s;e&s;s them&s;elves to be Epi&s;copalians, have Liberty to go out on the Lord's-Day, and at other Times, to attend on the Mode of Wor&s;hip in which they were educated, as often as will not be an Infraction on the general Rules of Or|der in the College. Per&s;ons of all Denominations of Prote&s;tants are allowed the Advantage of an Educa|tion here, and no Inquiry has been made, at their Admi&s;&s;ion or afterwards, about their particular Sen|timents in Religion.

as are contrary to the Fundamentals of Chri&s;tianity, and the &s;pecial De&s;ign of founding this College, &s;o that Parents &s;hould ju&s;tly be afraid of venturing their Children here, it is probable that &s;ome Notice would be taken of it. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act of the Tru&s;tees <HI>1722,</HI> and the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Honorable the General A&s;&s;embly in May <HI>1742.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The principal De&s;ign of the In&s;titution of this Col|lege, was to educate Per&s;ons for the Work of the Mini&s;try; which De&s;ign has been &s;o far &s;ucceeded as that above Four Hundred worthy Mini&s;ters have re|ceived their Education here, of which 40 have been epi&s;copally ordained, and four of them have been judged qualified for the Degree of <HI>Doctor of Divinity,</HI> by the Univer&s;ities in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> Yet ina&s;much as more have been educated, than are nece&s;&s;ary for the immediate Service of the Churches, and are de|&s;igned for various other publick and important Sta|tions in civil Life; the Pre&s;ident therefore frequently makes publick Di&s;&s;ertations upon every Subjects nece&s;|&s;ary to be under&s;tood, to qualify young Gentlemen for tho&s;e various Stations and Employments; &s;uch as the Nature of civil Government, the civil Con&s;titu|tion of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the various Kinds of Courts, and Officers &s;uperior and inferior, the &s;everal Kinds of Laws by which the Kingdom is governed; as the Statute, Common, Civil, Canon, Military and Maritime Laws; together with their &s;everal various Origins and Extents; the &s;everal Forms of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Govern|ment which have obtained in the Chri&s;tian Church; ancient Hi&s;tory and Chronology, the Nature and Form of obligatory Writings and In&s;truments, Agriculture, Commerce, Navigation, with &s;ome general Sketches upon Phy&s;ick, Anatomy, Heraldry and Gunnery, &s;o

far as it falls under the Rules of Philo&s;ophy and Ma|thematicks; that &s;o every one educated here might have, at lea&s;t, a general and &s;uperficial Knowledge of every important Affair of Life; and be directed to tho&s;e Books which may give him a more complete Knowledge of that particular Art and Science, which may be mo&s;t agreable to his own Genius or Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all the Students re&s;ide in the College, and are boarded by the Steward in the Hall, after the Manner of common Families without any Re&s;triction of Weight or Mea&s;ure; for which they pay 4<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 6<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> per Week Sterling. This Provi&s;ion is generally agre|able, &s;o that the Tutors always, the Pre&s;ident fre|quently, the Fellows, and many other Gentlemen, occa&s;ionally are entertained with it.</P>
<P>The undergraduate Students al&s;o pay for Tuition and In&s;truction 9 Shillings, for the Rent of their Chambers and Studies 1<ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> 2<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> for Repairs and other con|tingent Charges One Shilling Sterling, per Quarter: Which Sums are collected by the Steward, and paid out by Order from the Pre&s;ident and Fellows. After the nece&s;&s;ary incident Charges are deducted, the Re|&s;idue is applied for the Payment of the Salaries of the Officers, which of late Years have been to the Pre&s;ident &pound;. 110, to each of the three Tutors &pound;. 43, and to the Senior Tutor, who is Keeper of the Li|brary, &pound;. 6 Sterling more. Altho' tho&s;e Salaries are &s;canty enough, yet ina&s;much as the Incomes are now le&s;&s;ened by Rea&s;on of the Poverty of the Country, and the Diminution of the Number of Students, it is feared, that either the Salaries, or the Number of the Officers mu&s;t be dimini&s;hed, either of which will be inconvenient.</P>
<P>In the Exerci&s;e of Di&s;cipline, Care is taken to impre&s;s the Minds of the Students with a Sen&s;e of

the Amiablene&s;s of Virtue and the odious Nature of all Vice and Di&s;order, and the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of ob|&s;erving all the Laws and Orders of the Society, from a Principle of Choice, Virtue and Honor. In tho&s;e In&s;tances where the&s;e Motives have not their de&s;ired Influence, and any are guilty of Mi&s;demeanors of a le&s;&s;er Kind, they are reprimanded, or puni&s;hed with &s;ome &s;mall Fine, as a Prelude or Earne&s;t of a greater Puni&s;hment, if they per&s;i&s;t in doing the like: If they do per&s;i&s;t, and are guilty of &s;ome greater Crime, they are publickly admoni&s;hed or ru&s;ticated, for &s;ome Months. If they are guilty of an habitual Cour&s;e of Idlene&s;s and Negligence in their Studies and Attendance on Prayers and Recitations; or if they are guilty of a Cour&s;e of any con&s;iderable Crimes, after le&s;&s;er Puni&s;hments, they are ru&s;ticated for a Year, and put back in the next Cla&s;s, or wholly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from being Members of College. And if they are guilty of gro&s;s Immoralities, or any Crimes of a hei|nous and atrocious Nature, de&s;tructive to the Soci|ety, they are expelled. When any of the&s;e greater Puni&s;hments are publickly inflicted upon any, the Pre&s;ident makes a &s;olemn Addre&s;s to the Re&s;t, to im|pre&s;s upon their Minds a Sen&s;e of the evil Na|ture and Con&s;equence of &s;uch <HI>Crimes,</HI> and to per&s;uade them to take Warning not to do the like.</P>
<P>We have a good Library, con&s;i&s;ting of about 4000 Volumes, well furni&s;hed with ancient Authors; &s;uch as the Fathers, Hi&s;torians, and Cla&s;&s;icks, many mo|dern valuable Books of Divinity, Hi&s;tory, Philo&s;ophy, and Mathematicks, but not many Authors who have wrote within the&s;e 30 Years.&mdash;We have a good Air-Pump, Set of Globes, Tele&s;cope, &s;mall A&s;tro|nomical Quadrant, Micro&s;cope, Thermometer, The|odolite,

and an electrical Machine: but no other Ap|paratus, of any great Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The Students enjoy all nece&s;&s;ary Means of In&s;truc|tion; and are under the Advantage of geting all that valuable and u&s;eful Knowledge, which they can, or will acquire in the Space of four Years.</P>
<P>In order to di&s;cover their Proficiency, and to excite them to a laudable Ambition to excel, there is a publick Examination of each Cla&s;s, about once a Quarter; with Orations or Speeches pertinent to the Occa&s;ion. In July, annually, there is a formal Examination of the Candidates for the Degree of Bachelor of Arts, in the Languages, Arts and Sci|ences; and in the whole Circle of Academical Lite|rature: which is carried on publickly in the Cha|pel, by the Tutors and any other Gentlemen, of a liberal Education, who &s;ee cau&s;e to join with them. After Examination, the Candidates are &s;everally put to Vote, by the Moderator, whether they are qua|lified for a Degree? And they accordingly return a formal Certificate to the Pre&s;ident. In &s;ome In|&s;tances, Compa&s;&s;ion has had a great Influence. On this Occa&s;ion, &s;everal pertinent Speeches are made, in Latin, by the Pre&s;ident and Tutors; and two publick Orations, by the Candidates: the one to give a Specimen of their Knowledge in the &s;everal Branches of Academical Literature: and the other to give a grateful and pathetick Valediction to all the Officers and Members of the Society. The Law obliges all the Candidates for the Degree of Ma&s;|ter of Arts to attend before the Commencement, and give &s;ome Specimen of their Proficiency in Know|ledge: but this has been two generally di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="010262_0091_0F7E48A5101EF018">The publick Commencement is ordinarily on the &s;econd Wedne&s;day in September annually: at which there is a large A&s;&s;embly, con&s;i&s;ting of the Pre&s;i|dent and Fellows, a great Number of Mini&s;ters, and other learned and &s;uperior Gentlemen. The Pre&s;i|dent begins the Solemnity with Prayer, one of the Candidates, for the fir&s;t Degree, makes a &s;alutatory Oration to the Governor and Council, the Officers of College, and the whole A&s;&s;embly: the others give a Specimen of their Learning, by di&s;puting Syllogi&s;tically on the Que&s;tions, printed in their The|&s;es; which are then di&s;tributed. The like is done in the Afternoon by the Candidates for the Degree of Ma&s;ter of Arts. Then the Pre&s;ident, with the Con&s;ent of the Fellows, gives them their Degrees, three at a Time, in this Form:</P>
<P>PRO Auctoritate mihi commi&s;&s;a, admitto vos ad Primum Gradum in artibus; pro More Academi|arum in Anglia. Vobi&s;que trado hunc Librum, una cum Pote&s;tate publice Praelegendi, quotie&s;cunque ad i&s;thoc Munus evocati fueritis: cujus, haec in|&s;trumenta, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Pre&s;ident delivers to each of them a <HI>Diploma.</HI></NOTE> membrano &s;cripta, Te&s;timonio &s;int.</P>
<P>The like Form is u&s;ed for the <HI>Masters,</HI> only in|&s;tead of <HI>Primum,</HI> it is, <HI>Secundum:</HI> and in&s;tead of <HI>Prae|legendi,</HI> it is, <HI>Profitendi;</HI> and &s;ometimes, in&s;tead of <HI>Pri|mum,</HI> the Pre&s;ident &s;ays, <HI>Gradum Baccalaureatus;</HI> and in&s;tead of <HI>Secundum,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>Gradum Magi&s;tralem.</HI></P>
<P>Then one of the Ma&s;ters makes a Valedictory Oration: and the Pre&s;ident concludes the whole Solemnity with a Prayer.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="010262_0092_0F7E48A5957FA980">The Proficiency made by the Students is various; according to their different Genius and Applica|tion: a Number in each Cla&s;s are generally fini&s;hed Scholars in the Languages, and the liberal Arts and Sciences: and if they were dignified with &s;ome kind of peculiar Laurel, it might be an additional Stimu|lus:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is al&s;o true, that &s;ome who have been educated and graduated here, have, by their Conduct, been no Honour to the Society: and &s;ince the Honour of every Degree, Title, or Office, will finally be to each Individual, according to the real Merit of the Ge|nerality of tho&s;e in the &s;ame Order; and every In&s;tance of Honour, conferred upon an unworthy Subject, is eventually, at the Expence of tho&s;e who are worthy; it is greatly to be de&s;ired, that more equal Ju&s;tice &s;hould be done in that Re&s;pect.</NOTE> but their &s;uperior Qualifications are &s;oon known to the World; and they, in a little Time, make a u&s;eful Figure in Church or State.
