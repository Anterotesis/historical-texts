When</HI> and <HI>How</HI> and <HI>Why</HI> to <HI>hold ones peace,</HI> truly 'tis a Thing the People of GOD &s;hould be well-acquain|ted withal.</P>
<P>BEFORE I go any further, I am to tell you, <HI>when</HI> this Duty of <HI>&s;ilence</HI> is to be Studied. It mu&s;t be our &s;tudy <HI>To hold our peace,</HI> when we have <HI>&s;ad things</HI> be|falling of us. The <HI>&s;ea&s;on</HI> of the Duty is, when we meet with grievous Occur|rences, with heavy Calamities. <HI>How</HI> and <HI>Why</HI> the Duty is to be attended, you &s;hall be told, after I have informed you <HI>who</HI> 'tis that gives us the Pattern of it.</P>
<P>IT was <HI>Aaron,</HI> an Eminent Mini&s;ter of GOD, yea, the <HI>High-Prie&s;t of I&s;rael. Sad Things</HI> befell the Family of this Ex|cellent Man. Two of his Children were taken from him; yea, with very awful Circum&s;tances taken from him. GOD Struck them Dead, with <HI>Fire from Hea|ven.</HI> A <HI>Fire from Heaven</HI> had lately con&s;umed the <HI>Burnt-Offerings</HI> of the <HI>Bra|zen
<PB N="3" REF="002250_0006_0FDADA0F0CC43810">Altar.</HI> GOD required, That this <HI>Fire</HI> &s;hould always be kept alive with a <HI>perfetual Fuel,</HI> and be the <HI>only Fire</HI> em|ployed in <HI>all</HI> their Offerings. But the Two Sons of <HI>Aaron,</HI> who Officiated in the <HI>Prie&s;thood</HI> under him, imagined (as the Jews interpret the matter to us) that this <HI>Fire</HI> was only for the <HI>Burnt-Offerings:</HI> For the <HI>Altar of Incen&s;e</HI> they imagined, they might fetch their <HI>Fire</HI> el&s;ewhere; and they did &s;o. GOD was offended; and by &s;triking them <HI>Dead,</HI> on the very <HI>Fir&s;t Day</HI> after the Service of the <HI>Altar</HI> began, and after the <HI>Seven Days</HI> for the <HI>Con&s;ecration</HI> were fini&s;hed and they were to offer <HI>Sacrifices</HI> for them&s;elves and the People, He gave a Lively Intimation, that <HI>Life</HI> was not now to be obtained or expected from <HI>that Service.</HI> No, 'tis our JESUS alone, who is the <HI>Truth</HI> and the <HI>Life.</HI></P>
<P>THE Conduct of <HI>Aaron</HI> under the <HI>&s;ad Things</HI> which befell him and his Fami|ly, is now to be ob&s;erved. The <HI>Saint of the Lord</HI> has this Reported of him; <HI>He hold his peace.</HI> A <HI>Good Report!</HI> The Con&s;ideration which produced this <HI>Holy &s;ilence</HI> in him, was in the Me&s;&s;age, which
<PB N="4" REF="002250_0007_0FDADA108DC446D8">his Brother brought from GOD unto him. <HI>The Lord &s;aid, I will be Sanctified in them that come nigh unto me; and be|fore all the People will I be glorified.</HI> The Glorious GOD would be con&s;idered, as the Di&s;pen&s;er of the <HI>&s;ad Things</HI> which the Man of GOD met withal, and would accordingly be Glorified.</P>
<P>AND now, may a DOCTRINE <HI>Worthy of all Acceptation,</HI> be by all of us duely <HI>Accepted</HI> of.</P>
<P><HI>SINCE 'tis the Glorious GOD, who is the Doer of all that in the &s;ad Things which we meet withal is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne unto us, it becomes us to Glorify Him with an an HOLY SILENCE under them.</HI></P>
<P>I call to mind, that when <HI>David</HI> as well as <HI>Aaron,</HI> had <HI>&s;ad Things</HI> befalling him, he gives this Account of his Con|duct under them, P&s;al. XXXIX. 9. <HI>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; becau&s;e thou did&s;t it.</HI> I am very much of the Opini|on, that when that Servant of GOD &s;o Behaved and Expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, he doubtle&s;s had in his Eye, the Story of <HI>Aaron,</HI> which I now have in mine: A Story which he could not but be well|appri&s;ed of. So then having the Ad|vantage
<PB N="5" REF="002250_0008_0FDADA146F241D80">of thus calling in <HI>David</HI> as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s <HI>Aaron</HI> to &s;upport my DOCTRINE, it may now be &s;aid, tho&s;e Two Bright Stars, <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> &s;hall now ap|pear in <HI>Conjunction;</HI> and by your <HI>Ob&s;er|vation</HI> of them, you &s;hall under&s;tand how to Steer in the Darke&s;t Hours that <HI>&s;ad Things</HI> may bring upon you. Under &s;ad Things, the Great Thing with which we are to Glorify GOD, is PATIENCE; PATIENCE. The Thing required of us, is that, Jam. I. 4. <HI>Let Patience have its perfect work.</HI> I don't Remember that the Hebrew Language, has any Term for <HI>Patience,</HI> but that of <HI>&s;ilence.</HI> The De&s;cription which the Old Te&s;tament gives of <HI>Patience,</HI> is <HI>To be Dumb, and not Open ones Mouth.</HI> There are &s;ome, who &s;o read, P&s;al. LXV. 1. <HI>Silence is prai&s;e to thee, O GOD.</HI> Our GOD is never more <HI>Prai&s;ed</HI> than by our <HI>&s;ilence.</HI> Our <HI>&s;ilence</HI> under &s;ad Things, will be a mo&s;t nota|ble <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> to our GOD.

<P N="1">I. WE are to lay down the <HI>Maxim,</HI> which does command, and may even compel, the <HI>Holy &s;ilence,</HI> that is to be

<P>Secondly. YOUR <HI>Complaint</HI> unto the Lord, under your <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> mu&s;t be your <HI>Pray|er</HI> to the Lord, that He would <HI>undertake</HI> for you. It mu&s;t be an Addre&s;s to the Lord, that you may be help't under

<P>Fir&s;t.

<P>Secondly.

<P>Thirdly. MAY GOD <HI>undertake</HI> for us, That we may be <HI>Sav'd out</HI> of our <HI>Op|pre&s;&s;ions.</HI> The Great GOD, is the <HI>GOD of Salvations.</HI> If once He <HI>undertake</HI> for us, we &s;hall have <HI>Salvations</HI> from our <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ions.</HI> The cry of the <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed</HI> is, <HI>Ari&s;e and &s;ave us.</HI> We read, P&s;al.

<P>THIS is what we have to do. But now,</P>
<P>WE will Enquire, Secondly. <HI>Why</HI> the
<PB N="14" REF="002250_0051_0FDADA8CAD564708"><HI>oppre&s;&s;ed</HI> &s;hould thus make their Com|plaint unto the Lord.</P>
<P>WE will An&s;wer. It &s;hould be done for the&s;e Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. THERE is the <HI>Hand</HI> of GOD, in all our <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ions.</HI> It is the <HI>Hand</HI> of GOD, that lays them on. Tho' the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD can be no <HI>Oppre&s;&s;or;</HI> yet we can &s;uffer no <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> without the <HI>Will</HI> of GOD. All our <HI>Afflictions</HI> are or|dered by GOD. It was a word &s;poken once to one, who cryed out, <HI>I am Oppre&s;|&s;ed;</HI> Job. V. 6, 8. <HI>Affliction comes not forth of the Du&s;t, neither does Trouble &s;pring out of the Ground; I would &s;eek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cau&s;e.</HI> Whatever <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;es</HI> may Afflict us, and <HI>Oppre&s;s</HI> us, 'tis the unexceptionable <HI>Pro|vidence</HI> of GOD, that has brought them upon us. If it be the <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion of Man,</HI> that is grievous unto us, even this al&s;o is not without the <HI>Providence</HI> of GOD. No Man can wrong us, but it may be &s;aid, <HI>God has bidden him.</HI> We read, Job. XXXIV. 29. <HI>When He giveth Quiet|ne&s;s who can make Trouble?</HI> Well then; Since we have to do with GOD, in all our <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ions,</HI> what &s;hall we do, but
<PB N="15" REF="002250_0052_0FDADA8DCD3FC8E0">make our <HI>Complaint</HI> unto GOD? Yea, GOD &s;ends our <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> upon us, on purpo&s;e to provoke and produce our <HI>Complaint</HI> unto <HI>Him.</HI> He &s;ays, <HI>In their Affliction, &s;urely they will &s;eek me Early.</HI> The <HI>&s;ame Hand</HI> that lays our <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> upon us; whither &s;hall we look but unto <HI>that Hand,</HI> either to moderate them to us, or to deliver us from them?</P>
<P>Secondly. THE Faithful GOD is <HI>Engag'd</HI> for our Help in all our <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ions.</HI> The very <HI>Nature</HI> of GOD, this is full of <HI>Mercy,</HI> full of <HI>Pity.</HI> There is in the very <HI>Nature</HI> of GOD, a Compa&s;&s;ion for the Oppre&s;&s;ed. We read, Lam. III. 32. <HI>Tho' He cau&s;e grief, yet will be have compo&s;&s;ion, according to the Multitude of His Mercies.</HI> Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that when <HI>Sinful</HI> Men have brought &s;ad <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> and Confu&s;ions on them&s;elves by their <HI>Sins,</HI> yet if they make their <HI>Complaint</HI> unto the Lord, He &s;oon &s;ays, <HI>Tho' I have brought &s;uch things upon them, yet I earne&s;tly remember them &s;till, and I will &s;urely have mercy on them.</HI> 'Tis therefore al&s;o one of the <HI>Titles,</HI> by which the Lord has made Him&s;elf known unto us; P&s;al. IX. 9. <HI>The Lord will be a Refuge
<PB N="16" REF="002250_0053_0FDADA8F7A077FD0">for the oppre&s;&s;ed.</HI> And, P&s;al. X. 18. <HI>He will judge the oppre&s;&s;ed.</HI> Yea, And there is the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> of GOD for it. GOD has <HI>Promi&s;ed,</HI> That when the <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ed</HI> bring their complaint unto Him, they &s;hall not &s;eek His Face in vain. Thus we read; P&s;al. XII. 5. <HI>For the oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor, for the &s;ighing of the needy, now will I ari&s;e, &s;aith the Lord. Oppre&s;&s;ed Believer,</HI> why art thou <HI>ca&s;t down?</HI> why is thy <HI>Soul di&s;quieted</HI> within thee? Go tell the Lord, all that lies as a <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s</HI> upon thee; Thou wilt find him ready to take notice of thy <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> ready to do thee Good.</P>
<P>Thirdly. <HI>NONE</HI> but GOD <HI>can help</HI> us in all our <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ions.</HI> We read, Jer. III. 23. <HI>In vain is &s;alvation expected el&s;e|where; Truly in the Lord our GOD is the &s;alvation of I&s;rael.</HI> It is <HI>in vain</HI> to ask, any one el&s;e but the Lord only to <HI>Under|take</HI> for us. If <HI>Creatures</HI> do <HI>undertake</HI> any thing for us, without GOD they can <HI>Accompli&s;h</HI> nothing for us. They are all Phy&s;icians of no value. We read, Job XXI. 4. <HI>As for me, is my Complaint unto man? If it were &s;o &mdash; 'Tis in vain</HI> for us to call, <HI>O Friend, undertake for
<PB N="17" REF="002250_0054_0FDADA90CA222978">me.</HI> We have no way left, but to call, <HI>O Lord, undertake for me.</HI> All other <HI>Undertakers</HI> will be <HI>mi&s;erable Comforters.</HI> They will effectually put us off, as the King did the poor <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ed</HI> Woman; <HI>If the Lord help thee not, whence can I help thee!</HI> GOD is the only <HI>Refuge of the Oppre&s;&s;ed.</HI> When any <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> is upon us, we mu&s;t make that Conclu&s;ion; <Q><HI>My Soul, wait thou only upon GOD; for my expectation is from Him alone. He only is my Rock and my Salvation.</HI></Q></P>

<P N="5">V. WE mu&s;t not break off until the <HI>Sureti&s;hip</HI> of our LORD JESUS CHRIST be clearly &s;et before us; the Sureti&s;hip in which is laid up all our <HI>Salvation.</HI> Of our SAVIOUR we read, Heb. VII. 22. Our <HI>JESUS made a Surety.</HI> Oh! Give a great Attention!</P>
<P>KNOW it <HI>fir&s;t;</HI> That you have &s;uch <HI>Loads</HI> lying upon you, as will &s;ink you into Eternal Wretchedne&s;s, if they be not &s;ea&s;onably taken off.

<P>BUT Know it, <HI>Secondly;</HI> That a Glo|rious CHRIST has <HI>Undertaken</HI> to take off the <HI>Loads,</HI> of the Sinners that Sigh and Seek unto Him.

<P>I have done. You are no doubt a|ware of it, that &s;ome very Afflictive Things in my own Condition, e&s;pecially on the &s;core of my call this Day to the Sacrifices of a <HI>Jepthah,</HI> and in the Condi|tion of &s;ome very nearly Related unto me; have led me to the&s;e Meditations.</P>

I will only ob&s;erve to you, the&s;e Two Things upon it.</P>
<P>THE One is; That it is a Con&s;olation to me when I am o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and much <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed,</HI> and become a <HI>Man of Sorrows,</HI> it is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|dered by a Gracious GOD, that &s;ome of His People fare the better for my <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r|rows;</HI> I can truly &s;ay, This renders my <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> in &s;ome Degree <HI>welcome</HI> to me, in that I perceive He makes them <HI>U&s;eful</HI> to the People, unto who&s;e Edifi|cation my All is Dedicated.</P>
<P>THE Other is; That I can a&s;&s;ure you, a poor <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ed</HI> Servant of GOD, having the view of a CHRIST concerned for him, and feeling a CHRIST po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing of him, and conver&s;ing with him, finds e|nough and enough to comfort him, in the <HI>Multitude of his Thoughts within him.</HI> Upon the <HI>precious Thoughts</HI> of a CHRIST, he is kept from <HI>fainting</HI> under any <HI>Op|pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ions;</HI> The Fatigue of them Vani&s;hes; He can mount and &s;oar and Sing the Songs, which <HI>GOD our Maker</HI> has pro|vided for the darke&s;t <HI>Night,</HI> that is ever pa&s;&s;ing over him.</P>
