<HEAD>LECTURES ON THE PROPHECIES THAT REMAIN TO BE FULFILLED.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="lecture">
<HEAD><HI>LECTURE I.</HI> Prophecies of the final Re&s;toration of all men; collect|ed from the Sacred Scriptures. With &s;ome brief Ob&s;ervations upon them.</HEAD>
<P>THE next thing that claims our attention after the prophecies of the New Heaven, New Earth, and New Jeru&s;alem, and which is by far the mo&s;t important &s;ubject of prophecy, is, <HI>The final re&s;|toration of fallen Intelligences.</HI></P>
<P>This appears to be the very de&s;ign of God in the new creation, and the de&s;cent of the holy city from heaven to the new earth, as has been already &s;hewn:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Reader will ob&s;erve that the Author in the&s;e two Lectures has reference to &s;ome parts of his other Lectures, delivered previous to the&s;e.&mdash;The whole cour&s;e of them that have been publi&s;hed in London, contain four large octavo volumes.&mdash;But few &s;ets have ever reached America. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> and indeed, if this hypothe&s;is is true, and the&s;e pro|phecies are to be under&s;tood in their plain, literal &s;en&s;e, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to gain&s;ay the <HI>general re&s;toration,</HI> which &s;tands evidently connected with the new creation. For why &s;hould the earth, the ha|bitation
<PB N="4" REF="025049_0004_0FCDAF73B3BB1E48">
of men, be renewed, unle&s;s it is the plea&s;ure of God to renew and re&s;tore mankind to dwell upon it? And to what purpo&s;e &s;hould the holy city, the habitation of God, and the Lamb, and the &s;aints, de&s;cend from heaven, unle&s;s with a view to this grand event? The argument drawn from the re&s;toration of the natural and material creation, to that of the rational and moral, is to me highly conclu&s;ive and convincing. But in the account of the new creation, God does not leave us to our rea&s;on alone, to draw the conclu&s;ion of the re&s;toration of men from tho&s;e premi&s;es before mentioned, viz. the Renovation of the earth and heaven, and the de&s;cent of the holy city, how rational and conclu&s;ive &s;oever &s;uch a con|&s;equence would have been; but reveals in plain terms his glorious de&s;ign, and the rea&s;on why he would have his tabernacle with men, viz. <HI>That he might dwell with them, and that they might be his people, and that God him&s;elf might be with them, and be their God: and that be might wipe away all tears from their eyes, and forever aboli&s;h death, &s;orrow, crying and pain,</HI> (which are the very component parts of mi&s;ery) <HI>and that be might make all things new.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e things I have con&s;idered in the two prece|ding Lectures, and I really think, for my own part, that if the Scriptures of divine truth afforded no other con&s;cience of this glorious doctrine, THE UNIVERSAL RESTORATION, than what is found in the two la&s;t Chapters of the Revelation of St. John, there is enough to lay a foundation for our faith and hope in this matter, and e&s;pecially as God commanded tho&s;e words to be written in particular, and gave them the epithet of <HI>faithful and true &s;ayings.</HI></P>
<P>But we have no need to confine our&s;elves to the&s;e chapters, nor to this book; for the times of the <HI>re&s;|titution of all things</HI> &s;hall come, of which St. Peter informs us, that <Q>God hath &s;poken by the mouth of all his holy prophets &s;ince the world began:</Q>
<PB N="5" REF="025049_0005_0FCDAFA969234000">
Acts iii. 21. And this glorious purpo&s;e of God, being time which he hath had in view from the beginning, and &s;eeing that it is of the highe&s;t importance both to the honour of the great Creator, and the happine&s;s of his creatures, we may expect to find the knowledge of it communicated to men through all the &s;acred writings, beginning with the fir&s;t di&s;play of the light of the go&s;pel, and opening and increa&s;ing as that in|crea&s;ed. For this purpo&s;e let us carefully and can|didly &s;urvey the prophetic writings upon this &s;ubject, beginning with Mo&s;es, and coming down to St. John; one leading the van, and the other bringing up the rear. And if we find that the plain &s;en&s;e of prophe|cy bids us look for the re&s;toration of all mankind at la&s;t, to a &s;tate of &s;ubjection to God, and con&s;equent|ly deliverance from &s;in and its con&s;equences, and a return to holine&s;s and happine&s;s, let us not reject the idea becau&s;e it has not been generally received by mankind, but rejoice, and give prai&s;e to God, who hath revealed it for our comfort and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t prophecy that I &s;hall mention, and which is the foundation of all the re&s;t, is Gen. iii. 15. &mdash; <Q>And I will put enmity between thee and the wo|man, and between thy &s;eed and her &s;eed: It (or, He) &s;hall brui&s;e thy head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heel.</Q></P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t intimation of mercy to the pa|rents of mankind after their fall, and may with pro|priety be called, The Go&s;pel preached by JEHOVAH.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t is without all doubt the very per&s;on intend|ed by the <HI>Seed of the woman;</HI> and by his brui&s;ing the &s;erpent's head, the total de&s;truction of Satan's kingdom, works, &amp;c. mu&s;t be meant, as I appre|hend; nor can I &s;ee how this threatening to the &s;er|pent can be con&s;i&s;tent with the common idea of the greater part of the human race being left to all eter|nity under the power and dominion of the devil.
<PB N="6" REF="025049_0006_0FCDAF74DB7576F8">
Brui&s;ing the &s;erpent's head is certain death to him; and applied to Satan, cannot mean le&s;s than the total de&s;truction of his dominion, de&s;igns, and influence; and a full reparation for all the damage that he hath done to the human race, and to the per&s;on of Chri&s;t him&s;elf. A brui&s;e of the heel is very painful, but the brui&s;e of the head is mortal. This di&s;tinction, which was made by the great Judge him&s;elf, implies, that however great the mi&s;chief done by Satan to mankind, and Chri&s;t as their head and repre&s;entative, might be, it &s;hould be healed; (and con&s;equently the mi&s;ery occa&s;ioned by &s;in could not endure to all eternity;) and that Chri&s;t's victory over &s;in and Satan &s;hould be perfect and compleat. But if &s;in and mi|&s;ery are to la&s;t to all eternity, and hold their dominion over the greater part of mankind, we &s;hould be al|mo&s;t tempted to rever&s;e the text, and &s;ay, that how|ever Chri&s;t and his religion might brui&s;e the &s;erpent's tail, and give a temporary &s;hock to his kingdom, yet that finally he &s;hould recover his &s;trength and domi|nion, and be able to &s;tand again&s;t the Prince of princes, and in &s;pite of all his endeavours maintain his u&s;urped authority, and keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his va&s;t empire, and hold his numerous &s;ubjects in their &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage.</P>
<P>But as &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in the writings of the Apo&s;tles are the be&s;t expo&s;itions of this prophecy that ever were written, I &s;hall mention them here, that you may &s;ee how the &s;acred writings agree upon this important point.</P>
<P>Heb. ii. 14, 15. <Q>Fora&s;much then as the chil|dren are partakers of fle&s;h and blood, he al&s;o him|&s;elf likewi&s;e took part of the &s;ame: that through death he might de&s;troy him that had the power of death, that is the devil: And deliver them who through, fear of death were all their life time &s;ub|ject to bondage.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="025049_0007_0FCDAFAAE5F96B98">1 John iii. 8. <Q>He that committeth &s;in is of the devil: for the devil &s;inneth from the beginning. For this purpo&s;e the Son of God was manife&s;ted, that he might de&s;troy the works of the devil.</Q></P>
<P>From the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages it appears evident to me, that one of our Saviour's de&s;igns in what he hath done and &s;uffered, and is now doing, and will do hereafter, is to de&s;troy and aboli&s;h the kingdom of Satan and darkne&s;s, &s;in, and mi&s;ery out of the univer&s;e, until neither the name nor con&s;equences of evil &s;hall re|main in all the wide creation. For if the devil him|&s;elf be ever de&s;troyed, to exi&s;t no more as a devil, and &s;in, which is his work be al&s;o totally de&s;troyed by the Son of God, then how can the con&s;equences of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion endure to all eternity?</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t dwell no longer upon this fir&s;t promi&s;e, but pa&s;s to notice that Go&s;pel which the Scripture preached to Abraham, I&s;aac, add Jacob, in full ex|pectation that God would ju&s;tify the heathen through faith, I &s;hall fir&s;t collect the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages, with St. Paul's comment upon them, and then make &s;ome very brief ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>When God fir&s;t called Abram from out of his country, and from among his kindred, he made him &s;everal great promi&s;es for his comfort and encourage|ment, and concluded with the&s;e mo&s;t gracious words, <Q>And in thee &s;hall all the families of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed.</Q> See Gen. xii. 1, 2, 3.</P>
<P>When Abraham had obeyed the voice of God, and had endured that mo&s;t &s;evere trial of offering up his &s;on I&s;aac upon the altar, then it plea&s;ed JEHOVAH to confirm his &s;everal promi&s;es made at different times to Abraham with a mo&s;t &s;olemn oath, and this among the re&s;t. And becau&s;e he could &s;wear by no greater, he &s;ware by him&s;elf, thus giving him the firme&s;t po&s;|&s;ible foundation for his faith to lay hold upon, <Q>By
<PB N="8" REF="025049_0008_0FCDAF77187C91E8">
My&s;elf have I &s;worn, faith JEHOVAH, for becau&s;e thou ha&s;t done this thing, and ha&s;t not with held thy &s;on thine only &s;on: That in ble&s;&s;ing I will ble&s;s thee,</Q> &amp;c.&mdash;<Q>And in thy &s;eed &s;hall all the nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed: becau&s;e thou ha&s;t obeyed my voice.</Q> Gen. xxii. 15&mdash;18.</P>
<P>The &s;ame glorious promi&s;e was renewed to I&s;aac in the&s;e words, <Q>And I will perform the oath which I &s;ware unto Abraham thy father; &amp;c. And in thy &s;eed &s;hall all the nations of the earth be ble&s;|&s;ed. Becau&s;e that Abraham obeyed my voice,</Q> &amp;c. Gen. xxvi. 3, 4, 5.</P>
<P>And the &s;ame was confirmed to Jacob, in nearly the &s;ame words, <Q>And in thee, and in thy &s;eed &s;hall all the families of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed.</Q> See Gen. xxviii. 13, 14, 15.</P>
<P>It is no wonder that the Apo&s;tle calls this, The Go&s;pel, or good news; For if any tidings from hea|ven ever de&s;erved the name of <HI>good news,</HI> &s;urely tho&s;e words &s;poken by God to the Fathers do.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle's commentary upon the promi&s;es made to Abraham may be read in Rom. iv. and Gal. iii. but I &s;hall only recite two pa&s;&s;ages out of the latter chapter: <Q>And the &s;cripture fore&s;eeing that God would ju&s;tify the heathen through faith, preached before the go&s;pel unto Abraham, &s;aying, In thee &s;hall all nations be ble&s;&s;ed.</Q> ver. 8.</P>
<P><Q>Now to Abraham and his &s;eed were the promi|&s;es made: he faith not, And to &s;eeds, as of many: but as of one, And to thy &s;eed, which is Chri&s;t.</Q> ver. 16.</P>
<P>It is evident that according to the&s;e promi&s;es all
<PB N="9" REF="025049_0009_0FCDAFB24EB72A88">
nations, tribes and families of the earth are to be ble&s;|&s;ed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; who was the &s;on and &s;eed of Abra|ham, as well as the promi&s;ed &s;eed of the woman. The Apo&s;tle Peter informs the Jews that the covenant which Go! made with the fathers, had this mo&s;t gra|cious; promi&s;e included therein, <Q>And in thy &s;eed &s;hall all the kindreds of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed.</Q> Acts iii. 25. <HI>All nations, families, and kindreds of the earth,</HI> appear to me to intend all people and per|&s;ons without any exception.</P>
<P>Their being ble&s;&s;ed in ihe &s;eed of Abraham, in|tends their being ble&s;&s;ed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and their being ble&s;&s;ed in Chri&s;t mo&s;t intend their final &s;alva|tion, for I cannot &s;ee how they can be ble&s;&s;ed in Chri&s;t, if they are to be annihilated and wholly de|&s;troyed out of exi&s;tence, or, (which is worte) doom|ed to <HI>endle&s;s</HI> mi&s;ery, woe and pain. They may be under the cur&s;e and condemnation, and even puni&s;h|ment and mi&s;ery for age, and yet the promi&s;e be at la&s;t fulfilled; but if they are to be cur&s;ed as long as God exi&s;ts, I think it would be hard to prove that ever they &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed at all.</P>
<P>All <HI>nations</HI> have never yet been ble&s;&s;ed in the &s;eed of Abraham, &s;till le&s;s all <HI>kindreds</HI> and <HI>families;</HI> many of whom were totally extirpated, and wholly cut off from the earth before Chri&s;t came into the world: but if the &s;criptures are true that God <Q>hath remem|bered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thou&s;and generations,</Q> or ages, P&s;al. cv. 8. then the&s;e promi&s;es may be fulfilled in the new earth, if not before; for not more than an hundred and fifty generations have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the creation.</P>
<P>Let us always remember, that no length of time, di&s;tance of place, or change of circum&s;tances in crea|tures, can make the promi&s;es of the great Creator void and of none effect. All his words mu&s;t be
<PB N="10" REF="025049_0010_0FCDAF7885CBEAD0">
fully accompli&s;hed at la&s;t, how long &s;oever the time may be. But tho&s;e who imagine that unle&s;s the pro|mi&s;es of God are all accompli&s;hed before the day of Judgment they cannot be fulfilled at all, have but narrow ideas of their va&s;t extent, and amazing impor|tance.</P>
<P>Since then all nations, families, and kindreds of the earth are to be ble&s;&s;ed in Chri&s;t, but have never yet obtained the ble&s;&s;ing, the&s;e prophecies yet remain to be fulfilled, and therefore they mu&s;t be hereafter accomplished; and their full accompli&s;hment in|volves therein the final &s;alvation of all mankind.</P>
<P>This appears conclu&s;ive to me, and I do not &s;ee how the force of it can be fairly evaded.</P>
<P>The next pa&s;&s;ages that I &s;hall notice, are tho&s;e which extend the mercy of God beyond his wrath &s;uch are Exod. xx. 5, 6. <Q>Vi&s;iting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and &s;hew|ing mercy unto thou&s;ands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</Q> See al&s;o Deut. v. 9, 10.</P>
<P>The&s;e words plainly extend the mercy of God far beyond his wrath, even as thou&s;ands are beyond three or four.</P>
<P>P&s;al. xxx. 5. <Q>For his anger endureth but a mo|ment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</Q></P>
<P>&mdash;ciii. 8, 9. <Q>JEHOVAH is merciful and graci|ous, &s;low to anger, and plenteous in mercy. He will not always chide; neither will he keep his anger for ever.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="025049_0011_0FCDAFB456B2DA20">Jer. iii. 12. <Q>For I am merciful, faith JEHOVAH, and I will not keep anger for ever.</Q></P>
<P>Lam. iii. 31. <Q>For JEHOVAH will not ca&s;t off for ever.</Q></P>
<P>Ezek. xvi. 42. <Q>So will I make my fury to|wards thee to re&s;t, and my jealou&s;y &s;hall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e and many other texts not only &s;peak of an entire ce&s;&s;ation of the anger of God, but even repre|&s;ent the time as &s;hort, compared with the duration of his mercy: but there mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;trange additions, to make the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages &s;peak con&s;i&s;tent with the doc|trine of endle&s;s mi&s;ery; in fact we mu&s;t be obliged nearly to rever&s;e them all to make them compatible with that mo&s;t dreadful idea.</P>
<P>There are more than forty pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture where it is &s;aid of the mercy of God, that it endureth for ever. This is the chorus or burden of the &s;ong in P&s;al. cxxxvi. where it is repeated in every ver&s;e. Now mercy mu&s;t be allowed to re&s;pect mi&s;ery, and is the form that love puts on towards the beloved objects, when in di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery. It cannot pro|perly be exerci&s;ed towards tho&s;e who never fell, nor any more upon them who are already perfectly reco|vered; and therefore fallen creatures, objects of God's love, are the only proper &s;ubjects of it. And &s;o long as love endures towards creatures in mi&s;ery, &s;o long will mercy have place; and this will be for|ever, or during all the ages that mi&s;ery remains. Mercy according to this plan, will outlive all wrath, pain, and mi&s;ery, and will reconcile all creatures; and will then return back to its original form and name, <HI>Love;</HI> in which it will remain to eternity.</P>
<P>But if endle&s;s mi&s;ery be a truth, we mu&s;t rever&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="025049_0012_0FCDAF7EEE9FF960">
all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, and &s;ay, that <HI>The mercy of God en|dureth but a moment, even for the &s;hort term of a man's life, but his wrath endures for ever; follows the &s;inner to all eternity; and &s;hall never be appea&s;ed, nor leave any room for the exerci&s;e of mercy!</HI></P>
<P>Mo&s;es calls upon the nations to rejoice with God's people, &s;aying, <Q>Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people;</Q> Deut. xxxii. 43. thereby intimating that the de&s;igns of God towards the nations of the earth were &s;uch as might lay a foundation for joy and rejoicing; and there are &s;everal intimations in the five books of Mo&s;es of God's favour towards the na|tions the earth, which my time will not permit me to mention.</P>
<P>The name or character of God, as proclaimed by Him&s;elf to Mo&s;es, is beautiful beyond de&s;cription, end exhibits as grand and lovely a picture of the ami|able perfections of the Deity as any we find in the Scriptures:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>And JEHOVAH pa&s;&s;ed by before him, and pro|claimed, JEHOVAH, JEHOVAH GOD, merciful and gracious, long-&s;uffering, and abundant in good|ne&s;s and truth. Keeping mercy for thou&s;ands, (of ages) forgiving iniquity, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in, and that will by no means clear the guilty; vi&s;iting the iniquity of the fathers upon the chil|dren, unto the third and to the fourth genera|tion.</Q> Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7.</P>
<P>And when I&s;rael rebelled again&s;t God, and he was ju&s;t going to &s;wear that the congregation then alive &s;hould never enter into the land of Canaan, he never|thele&s;s fir&s;t revealed to Mo&s;es his glorious purpo&s;e towards mankind, in the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed words: <Q>But as truly as I live, all the earth &s;hall be filled with the glory of JEHOVAH,</Q> Num. xiv. 21. Which I take
<PB N="13" REF="025049_0013_0FCDAFB548CA36B0">
to be the fame that is prophecied of by I&s;aiah, chap. xi. 9. and by Habakkuk, chap. ii. 14. and by Mala|chi, chap. i. 11.</P>
<P>The&s;e prophrecies &s;hall all have their accompli&s;h|ment in the time of the Millenium, which &s;hall la&s;t a thou&s;and years. But glorious as that period &s;hall be, it will be only a &s;pecimen or type of the glory of the new heavens and earth; which I have already con&s;idered.</P>
<P>But it is time to pa&s;s on to the book of P&s;alms, and to the writings of the prophets; where we &s;hall find many declarations of God's favour to all mankind, and many prophecies of their being brought at la&s;t to a &s;tate of &s;ubjection and obedience to their great Creator; and con&s;equently into a &s;tate of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The book of P&s;alms is &s;o excellent and compre|hen&s;ive, that there are but few matters of importance but what are touched upon therein; and though at fir&s;t &s;ight one might think that it was intended whol|ly for the purpo&s;e of treating upon &s;ubjects of con|templation and practical religion; yet upon a clo&s;er in&s;pection we find that it abounds in prophecies of various kinds; a great number of which re&s;pect the Redeemer in his various &s;tates of humiliation, exalta|tion&mdash;the &s;ucce&s;s of his go&s;pel&mdash;and the univer&s;ality of his empire. And it would be &s;trange, if &s;o impor|tant a &s;ubject as the univer&s;al &s;ubjection of men to the Me&s;&s;iah was not mentioned. But &s;o frequently is this great event alluded to in that book, that were I to confine my&s;elf entirely thereto, I &s;hould find matter enough for this pre&s;ent Lecture, and many more.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd P&s;alm, God &s;ays to his Son, <Q>A&s;k of me and I &s;hall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</Q> ver. 8.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="025049_0014_0FCDAF8006CF6C68">This reque&s;t has been made, and the Father hath given all things into the hands of Chri&s;t, for the ex|pre&s;s purpo&s;es of their being &s;ubdued, humbled, made &s;ubject to God, and being brought back again to the &s;ervice and enjoyment of their great Creator.</P>
<P>Receiving this gift, and thus on his part engaging to bring all back again, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t freely came into the world to do and &s;uffer the will of the Father.</P>

<P><Q>All the ends of the world &s;hall remember and turn unto JEHOVAH: and all the kindreds of the nations &s;hall wor&s;hip before thee.

All they that be &s;at upon earth &s;hall eat and wor&s;hip; all they that go down to the du&s;t &s;hall bow before him; and none can keep alive his own &s;oul. A &s;eed &s;hall &s;erve him; it &s;hall be accounted to JEHOVAH for a generation.</Q> ver. 27, 28, 29, 30.</P>
<P>In the&s;e words we have an important prophecy, that in con&s;equence of what Chri&s;t hath done and &s;uffered, and what he will do as Mediator, all the ends of the world &s;hall remember, and turn unto JEHOVAH, and all the kindreds of the nations &s;hall wor&s;hip before him. The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are almo&s;t as general as words can expre&s;s, and take in the whole race of men, and the things foretold of them are &s;uch as are incon&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of endle&s;s mi&s;ery,

viz. that they &s;hall <HI>remember,</HI> or think on their ways, lament their iniquities, reflect on the goodne&s;s and mercy of God, and the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t; and in con&s;equence freely and heartily turn to JEHOVAH, and wor&s;hip before him, giving prai&s;e and adoration to him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and to him that &s;uffered upon the cro&s;s. For as the kingdom be|longeth unto JEHOVAH, and all men are his creatures, therefore he has a right to their highe&s;t prai&s;es, and their noble&s;t &s;ervices; he claims them for his own, and will have them; for who &s;hall with&s;tand the Go|vernor of the univer&s;e, who doeth his plea&s;ure both in heaven and in earth?</P>
<P>As all that live are bound to wor&s;hip God, and &s;hall finally do &s;o, as certainly as they &s;hall eat, &s;o if they die before they have &s;ubmitted to him, death &s;hall not prevent the fulfilment of the divine purpo|&s;es; for all that go down to the du&s;t &s;hall bow before him.

<P>Here we find al&s;o that a peculiar &s;eed &s;hall &s;erve God, who &s;hall be the fir&s;t fruits of his creatures, and &s;hall be accounted to him as a cho&s;en generation; not to the exclu&s;ion of the re&s;t; for the general &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion of all is fir&s;t mentioned, and then this &s;eed is particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed. And this di&s;tinction of the &s;pecial and general redemption and &s;alvation, runs through the whole bible, as in intelligent reader may ea&s;ily perceive.</P>
<P>P&s;alm xlv. treats wholly of Chri&s;t, his church, the &s;ucce&s;s of his go&s;pel, his &s;ubduing power, and the &s;pread of his kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="025049_0016_0FCD83F200D7DDB8">How beautiful and grand are the following words, as addre&s;&s;ed by the Father to the Son!</P>

Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the &s;ceptre of thy kingdom is a right &s;ceptre</Q> ver. 3, 4, 5, 6.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t here repre&s;ented as armed with power and might, wi&s;dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s, truth and meek|ne&s;s, &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue and conquer his mo&s;t &s;tub|born foes, and cau&s;e them to become his willing &s;ub|jects.</P>
<P>There is another pa&s;&s;age in this beautiful P&s;alm that has given me a great deal of plea&s;ure, and that is, that not only the royal &s;pou&s;e, the bride of Chri&s;t, &s;hall be brought into the king's pre&s;ence, but. <Q>The virgins her companions that follow her &s;hall be brought; With gladne&s;s and rejoicing &s;hall they be brought: they &s;hall enter into the king's pa|lace.</Q> ver. 14, 15.

<P>The xlvii. P&s;alm is an excellent piece of &s;acred poetry, and, I am apt to think, de&s;cribes the a&s;cen|&s;ion and glory of Chri&s;t, and his univer&s;al govern|ment over the earth; and the clo&s;e of it looks forward to that great day when all &s;hall &s;ubmit to God,&mdash; <Q>The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the &s;hields of the earth belong unto God: he is great|ly exalted.</Q> ver. 9.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="025049_0017_0FCDAFBCCF6200E8">The&s;e words intimate that as God is the great and rightful proprietor of all, &s;o that finally all the prin|ces of the people &s;hall gather together to adore him.

<P>P&s;alm lxiv. 9. is worth reading in this place, <Q>And all men &s;hall fear and &s;hall declare the work of God: for they &s;hall wi&s;ely con&s;ider of his do|ing.</Q> The&s;e prophecies certainly intimate, that however long men may refu&s;e to fear God, and to be wi&s;e, yet they &s;hall all be truly wi&s;e at la&s;t.</P>
<P>P&s;alm lxv. 1, 2, 3. <Q>Prai&s;e waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion: and unto thee &s;hall the vow be performed. O thou that heare&s;t prayer, unto thee &s;hall all fle&s;h come. Iniquities prevail again&s;t me: as for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, thou &s;halt purge them away.</Q></P>
<P>This is a noble and very important prophecy, and includes &s;everal grand events therein, e&s;pecially the&s;e three, 1. That the vows which have been &s;o often made to God, and &s;hamefully broken, &s;hall be at la&s;t performed to his acceptance. 2. That unto him &s;hall all fle&s;h without exception come, voluntarily dedicating them&s;elves to his &s;ervice, in con&s;equence of his hearing their cries and granting them deliver|ance, and 3. That although iniquities have great|ly prevailed again&s;t mankind, and even the be&s;t, yet finally all our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions &s;hall be purged away.</P>

thee. All the earth &s;hall wor&s;hip thee, and &s;hall &s;ing unto thee: they &s;hall &s;ing to thy name.</Q></P>
<P>This is a glorious prophecy of the univer&s;al &s;ub|jection, and humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of all God's creatures to him, in con&s;equence of the greatne&s;s of his power. And le&s;t any &s;hould pretend that only a forced &s;ub|jection is intended, there is not only the expre&s;&s;ion of their &s;ubmitting <HI>them&s;elves</HI> unto God, which imphes a voluntary act, but a declaration that all the earth &s;hall wor&s;hip God, and &s;ing to him, and his name, which certainly &s;uppo&s;es a &s;tate of happine&s;s, accord|ing to the plain meaning of the text.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar pa&s;&s;age is found in P&s;alm lxxxvi. 9. <Q>All nations whom thou ha&s;t made &s;hall come and wor&s;hip before thee, O JEHOVAH: and &s;hall glo|rify thy name.</Q> If there are any nations and peo|ple whom God hath not made, they are evidently ex|cepted from this prophecy and promi&s;e, but el&s;e I cannot &s;ee why this is not as expre&s;s a promi&s;e of univer&s;al wor&s;hip and adoration being given to God by all nations, and of their coming voluntarily, and glorifying his name by chearful obedience, as we could wi&s;h. One would think that nothing need be plainer, and yet many pay no more attention to the&s;e expre&s;s prophecies, than though they were not written.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> a mo&s;t important prophecy in P&s;alm cxxxviii. 4, 5. that may well be connected with the foregoing,&mdash; <Q>All the kings of the earth &s;hall prai&s;e thee, O JEHOVAH, when they &s;hall hear the words of thy mouth.

<P>It is evident this prophecy has never been fulfilled, nor never can be unle&s;s the univer&s;al re&s;toration of men is true; for the greater part of the kings of the earth have been &s;o far from prai&s;ing God, and walk|ing

in his ways, that they have been the farthe&s;t from all appearance of true piety of any of the hu|man race; and have been the greate&s;t rebels again&s;t him, and the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate, wicked and tyrannical being that ever exi&s;ted: and &s;o have lived and died. But if all of them &s;hall be brought to &s;ubmit to JE|HOVAH, and to prai&s;e him with heart and voice, and to hear and obey the words of his mouth, and to &s;ing in his ways, and to behold and delight in his great glory, as this prophecy declares; then who can doubt of the re&s;toration of all the lower cla&s;&s;es of man|kind? For if the greate&s;t rebels &s;hall be &s;ubdued, cer|tainly by parity of rea&s;oning, much more the le&s;s rebellious. And if all the haughty tyrants that ever wort a crown, or wielded &s;word or &s;cepter, &s;hall hear the voice of God &s;o as to prai&s;e him freely and heartily, I cannot &s;ee but the univer&s;al &s;ubjection of all their &s;ubjects to the Great King, is proved to a demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>P&s;alm cxlv. is one of the mo&s;t beautiful P&s;alms in the book, and contains excellent &s;entences, and among the re&s;t, &s;ome charming declarations of God's univer&s;al goodne&s;s to his creatures, and faithful pro|phecies that they &s;hall all prai&s;e his name, and &s;ing of his righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s:&mdash; <Q>And men &s;hall &s;peak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatne&s;s.

<P>God is univer&s;ally good to his creatures, and the time &s;hall come when they &s;hall be &s;en&s;ible of it, and &s;hall prai&s;e his name with all their hearts, and with their noble&s;t powers fulfil his ble&s;&s;ed commands, and
<PB N="20" REF="025049_0020_0FCDAF831A5BE8D8">
glorify him for evermore. But all the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions appear to me entirely incon&s;i&s;tent with the doctrine of endle&s;s mi&s;ery. For how can God be &s;aid to be <HI>gracious, full of campo&s;&s;rom, &s;low to anger, and of great mercy, good to all, and extending his tender mer|cies over all his works,</HI> it he has no de&s;igns of grace and &s;alvation all? And how is it po&s;&s;ible that all his works &s;hall prai&s;e him, if a con&s;iderable part of his noble&s;t works &s;hall never be brought to love him, but &s;hall eternally, and while God exi&s;ts, remain his irreconcileable enemies, bla&s;pheming his name, in a &s;tate of endle&s;s, unavailing mi&s;ery?</P>
<P>The book of P&s;alms abounds with prophecies up|on this &s;ubject, many of which I have pa&s;&s;ed over for the &s;ake of brevity; and the very la&s;t ver&s;e in the book, though it &s;tands in our tran&s;iation in the form of an exhortation or command, <Q>Let every thing that hath breath prai&s;e the Lord;</Q> yet it might be rendered, perhaps with more propriety, <Q>Every thing that hath breath &s;hall prai&s;e JAH. Hallelujah.</Q> P&s;alm cl. 6. In this light it is a glorious, certain, and very exten&s;ive prophecy: Words cannot be more univer&s;al, than <Q><HI>every thing that hath breath:</HI></Q> The word <HI>&s;hall</HI> implies the certain|ty of the accompli&s;hment of it, and the matter on &s;ub|ject of the prophecy is mo&s;t glorious, they &s;hall <HI>prai&s;e</HI> JAH; they &s;hall adore their great Creator, with all their hearts and tongues, according to his will, and &s;hall give him the glory which is due to his name. And is not this prophecy ab&s;olutely incon|&s;i&s;tent with any of God's creatures always continuing his &s;ors, and remaining in a &s;tate of mi&s;ery during the whole of their exi&s;tence?</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the&s;e and many other prophecies, the very exhortations with which the book of P&s;alms abounds, to all people, nations, and tongues, to prai&s;e and magnify, adore and ble&s;s God, are &s;trong arguments to prove the Univer&s;al Re&s;toration: For,
<PB N="21" REF="025049_0021_0FCDAFBFE47C31D8">
why are tho&s;e exhortations given, if they are never to be complied with? And why are all exhorted to prai&s;e God for his goodne&s;s, love, mercy, kindne&s;s, and compa&s;&s;ion, if they are not all to &s;hare in the &s;ame? Many other pa&s;&s;ages might be produced, and arguments advanced out of this divine book to prove the glorious doctrine true. But my plan will not &s;uffer me to enlarge. The hints I have given are &s;ufficient to &s;hew that it is by no means overlooked among the great variety of noble and important &s;ub|jects treated of therein.</P>
<P>I come next to con&s;ider &s;ome of the prophecies of I&s;aiah upon this very intere&s;ting &s;ubject; and as he is commonly called, <HI>The evangelical Prophet,</HI> we may expect if this great event was revealed to any of the prophets, it was to him: And as St. Peter declares that God hath &s;poken of it <HI>by the mouth of all his boly Prophets, &s;ince the world began,</HI> Acts iii. 21. we may be &s;ure of &s;inding it in his prophecy.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not think of reciting all the intimations that God has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to give us by the mouth or pen of this &s;ublime prophet, of his merciful de&s;igns towards the whole human race; but con&s;ine my&s;elf to a few of the mo&s;t important.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t I &s;hall quote, is, chap. xxv. 6, 7, 8.&mdash; <Q>And in this mountain &s;hall JEHOVAH of ho&s;ts make unto all people a fea&s;t of &s;at things, a fea&s;t of wines on the lees; of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the le 3 well re&s;ined. And he will de&s;troy in this mountain the face of the covering ca&s;t over all people, and the vail that is &s;pread over all nations. He will &s;wallow up death in victory; and Adonai JEHOVAH will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people &s;hall he take away from off all the earth: for JEHOVAH hath &s;poken it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="025049_0022_0FCDAF87F7CCAEE8">This is a very exten&s;ive and important prophecy: it began to be fulfilled at the commencement of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation; is now ful&s;illing; and will be more fully accompli&s;hed in the time of the Milleni|um, when the knowledge of God &s;hall be univer&s;al. But its compleat accompli&s;hment &s;eems to be re|&s;erved for that di&s;pen&s;ation of which I have already treated, the new heaven and earth, when the New Jeru&s;alem &s;hall de&s;cend, and the tabernacle of God &s;hall be with men, and he will dwell with them; and they &s;hall be his people, and God him&s;elf &s;hall be with them, and be their God; and when God &s;hall wipe away all tears from their eyes; when there &s;hall be no more death, neither &s;orrow, not crying, neither &s;hall there be any more pain; for the former things &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed away; and all things &s;hall be made new. It is evident that l&s;aiah and St. John &s;oake of the &s;ame time or period, and nearly in the &s;ame words.

This the mouth of JEHOVAH hath &s;po|ken; and it cannot fail of being accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Then &s;hall be fulfilled another glorious prophecy &s;poken by the &s;ame prophet, chap. xl. 5. <Q>And the glory of JEHOVAH &s;hall be revealed, and all fleth &s;hall &s;ee it together: for the mouth of JEHO|VAH hath &s;poken it.</Q> This prophecy like the other is of great latitude and extent: it began to have us accompli&s;hment, at our Lord's coming forth to the work of the mini&s;try, but it cannot be &s;aid to be fully accompli&s;hed till all fle&s;h, or men, have not

<P>Then, when Christ &s;hall have entirely fini&s;hed his work as Mediator, all fle&s;h &s;hall behold the glo|ry of God together, and be made partakers of his &s;alvation.</P>

to look to him, and be &s;aved: The ends of the earth are invited, and &s;alvation is promi&s;ed to all who truly look to the glorious Saviour for &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>If the common Arminian &s;y&s;tem was the whole truth, no more need to have been added; it would have been enough to have &s;aid, <Q>There is a general provi&s;ion made for all men; and all the ends of the earth are invited to look to me, and &s;uch as look &s;hall be &s;aved; and as for the re&s;t they &s;hall have their choice, and I &s;hall exert my&s;elf no far|ther in their behalf.</Q> But the words go much be|yond an invitation, for that might be given, and yet take no certain effect upon the greater part, as we frequently &s;ee.

So then every one of us &s;hall give account of him&s;elf to God:</Q> This was &s;ufficient for the apo&s;tle's purpo&s;e in the &s;ubject he was then upon; and we all know from the Scriptures that the di&s;pen&s;ation of judgment mu&s;t pa&s;s upon all men here or hereafter: And I &s;uppo&s;e, and think I have made it evident, that the judgment of tho&s;e who do not hearken to the invitations of the go&s;pel, is one of the means by which the Saviour of mankind will bring his &s;oes to &s;ubmit to him; and if &s;o, then the quotation of this text by St. Paul;

in the fore cited pa&s;&s;age of the epi&s;tle to the Ro|mans, is &s;o far from being contradictory to the ideas I have of the text, that it is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent there with. But St. Paul by no means &s;uppo&s;ed that be|ing brought to judgment, and giving account of our|&s;elves to God, was the whole meaning of the pro|phet; for he has cited the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age in a much fuller manner in the epi&s;tle to the Philippians, in which he makes it &s;ignify much more than being <HI>judged,</HI> even to comprehend hearty &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, ado|ration, and the mo&s;t noble and free confe&s;&s;ion, for the mo&s;t important purpo&s;es; for the glory of God the Father, and the honour of the great Redeemer, and I may add, for their own happine&s;s, according to the language of the prophet. Becau&s;e Je&s;us &s;o humbled him&s;elf as to make him&s;elf of no reputation, to take upon him the form of a &s;ervant, and to be made in the likene&s;s of men, and being thus degra|ded as to be found in the fa&s;hion of a man, he hum|bled him&s;elf &s;till more, and became obedient unto death; yea, that his humiliation might be the great|e&s;t that was po&s;&s;ible, he &s;ubmitted to death in its mo&s;t painful and &s;hameful, yea, and mo&s;t accur&s;ed form, <HI>the death of the Cro&s;s;</HI> a puni&s;hment inflicted by the Romans only upon &s;laves, in ca&s;e of the mo&s;t atro|cious crimes. <Q>Wherefore God al&s;o hath highly exalted him; and hath given him a name which is above every name; That at (or in) the name of Je&s;us, every knee &s;hould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue &s;hould confe&s;s that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</Q> Phil. ii. 7&mdash;11.</P>
<P>Here the expre&s;&s;ions are very full and particular, every knee in heaven, earth, and under the earth, &s;hall bow, and &s;ubmit to Je&s;us; they &s;hall bow in his name, and pay him implicit homage and adora|tion; and every tongue &s;hall do more than give an account to the Judge&mdash;they &s;hall confe&s;s that he is

Lord&mdash;even their Lord&mdash;to the glory of God the Father!</P>
<P>Every word here u&s;ed &s;eems to imply a <HI>willing</HI> and not a <HI>forced &s;ubjection,</HI> as <HI>bowing in the name of Je&s;us, and confe&s;&s;ing him to be Lord of all, to the glo|ry of God the Father.</HI> There is not the lea&s;t intima|tion of any exception, all &s;hall bow and confe&s;s, and in the &s;ame manner, even in the name of Je&s;us, and for the &s;ame de&s;ign and end, the glory of God the Father. I can &s;ee no difference in the text with re&s;pect to this &s;ubjection and obedience, between tho&s;e in heaven, tho&s;e on earth, and tho&s;e under the earth; either all are willing and free, or none, for any thing that appears in the text. And indeed I am a&s;toni&s;hed that any can imagine that God can be plea&s;ed and glorified, and Chri&s;t rewarded and &s;atis|fied, with a forced &s;ubjection, what would not even plea&s;e an earthly monarch. I might &s;ay in this ca&s;e as God did re&s;pecting offering the blind, lame, and &s;ick, <Q>Offer it now unto thy governor, will he be plea&s;ed with thee, or accept thy per&s;on? &s;aith JE|HOVAH of ho&s;ts.</Q> Mal. i. 8. God always requir|ed the mo&s;t excellent things to be offered to him, and in the mo&s;t free and willing manner; and as he re|quires the whole heart, mind, and &s;trength, to be free|ly dedicated to him, it is not likely that he will ac|cept of a nominal, unwilling, and forced &s;ubjection and &s;ervice.</P>
<P>To return to the prophecy of I&s;aiah.</P>
<P>Whatever be the meaning of the words, <Q>unto me every knee &s;hall bow, and every tongue &s;hall &s;wear;</Q> they &s;hall certainly be accompli&s;hed in the very &s;en&s;e which he intended; yea, they mu&s;t, or the oath of God is made void at once, which would be horrid to &s;uppo&s;e. Even concerning his word he &s;aith, <Q>For as the rain cometh down, and the &s;now from heaven, and returneth not thither, but water|eth

the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give &s;eed to the &s;ower, and bread to the eater; So &s;hall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it &s;hall not return unto me void, but it &s;hall accompli&s;h that which I plea&s;e, and it &s;hall pro&s;per in the thing whereto I &s;ent it.</Q> I&s;ai. iv. 10, 11. And if the word of God &s;hall certainly accompli&s;h his intention at la&s;t, none can imagine that his mo&s;t &s;olemn oath &s;hall be void. The bowing of the knee implies both &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and adoration; and &s;wearing fealty and allegiance, &s;up|po&s;es pardon, reception, and protection, on the part of the monarch; and a hearty returning from rebellion, renouncing all other juri&s;diction, true hearty &s;ubjection, allegiance, and obedience on the part of the rebel. And however kings of the earth may be deceived, and impo&s;ed upon by fal&s;e oaths, feigned &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and forced unwilling &s;ubjection, it cannot be the ca&s;e with the great Supreme.</P>
<P>If this be allowed to be the true meaning of the text, I think the doctrine of the univer&s;al re&s;toration is evident. And if we read and con&s;ider the fore|going and following words, we &s;hall find that <HI>&s;alva|tion</HI> and not <HI>damnation</HI> &s;tands connected with this promi&s;e and oath of God; he doth not &s;wear that they &s;hall always remain his enemies, but on the con|trary that they &s;hall become his &s;ubjects; and that every tongue &s;hall not only &s;wear, but &s;hall &s;urely &s;ay, "In JEHOVAH have I righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength:" which &s;urely is incon&s;i&s;tent with endle&s;s damnation, but perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with &s;alvation. God does not &s;ay, <HI>They &s;hall never come,</HI> but on the contrary, <HI>To him &s;hall come;</HI> and all men are under&s;tood, by every knee, and every tongue; they &s;hall all come to him, and own him their Lord, and declare that in him is their righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength: and if this doth not imply their &s;alvation, I know not what doth; for if looking to him is &s;ufficient to &s;ave them, certainly coming to him can do no le&s;s; and if any
<PB N="29" REF="025049_0029_0FCDAFC9AAFF7628">
doubt remained, the univer&s;al declaration of every tongue, that, "In JEHOVAH have I righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength;" would be, I think, fully &s;ufficient to &s;et it a&s;ide, and &s;hew that all &s;hould be made parta|kers of &s;alvation. And as for that expre&s;&s;ion, that <HI>all that are incen&s;ed again&s;t him &s;hall be a&s;hamed;</HI> which many &s;uppo&s;e intimates that &s;ome &s;hall be left out, who &s;hall not be delivered, but always remain under the power of &s;in and &s;hame; this may be ea&s;ily, explained by a &s;imilar pa&s;&s;age in Ezek. xvi. where God promi&s;es to Jeru&s;alem, that he will remember his covenant, that he made with her in the days of her youth, and that he will e&s;tabli&s;h unto her an everla&s;ting covenant, which is certainly a &s;tate of &s;alvation and happine&s;s beyond all di&s;pute; yet he immediately adds, <Q>Then thou &s;halt remember thy ways and be a&s;hamed, when thou &s;halt receive thy &s;i&s;ters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters; but not by thy covenant: And I will e&s;tabli&s;h my covenant with thee; and thou &s;halt know that I am JEHO|VAH; That thou maye&s;t remember and be con|founded, and never open thy mouth any more becau&s;e of thy &s;hame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou ha&s;t done, &s;aith Adonai JE|HOVAH.</Q> ver. 60, 61, 62, 63.</P>
<P>Here it is plainly &s;een that a certain &s;en&s;e of &s;hame and confu&s;ion of face, in tho&s;e who have been guilty of high rebellion again&s;t the God of love and good|ne&s;s, when they come to be made &s;en&s;ible of it, and to have a manife&s;tation of pardon and forgivene&s;s, is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of happine&s;s and re|conciliation. Thus a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, is &s;o far from making &s;alvation void, that it is con&s;i&s;tent with God's being entirely pacified towards them for all that they have done, and with their being joined to him in an everla&s;ting covenant.</P>
<P>I might add much more upon this important pro|phecy

of I&s;aiah, but having dwelt long upon it, I mu&s;t pa&s;s on, to other pa&s;&s;ages, de&s;erving our notice.</P>
<P>This &s;ame in&s;pired writer makes the death of Chri&s;t and his ju&s;tifying grace of equal extent, <Q>JE|HOVAH hath laid on him the iniquity of us all;</Q> even all of us who like &s;heep have gone a&s;tray, and have turned every one to his own way. <Q>He &s;hall &s;ee of the travail of his &s;oul, and &s;hall be &s;atisfied: by his knowledge &s;hall my righteous &s;ervant ju&s;tify many (or the many); for he &s;hall bear their iniquities,</Q> Chap. liii. 6, 11.</P>
<P>It is plain that our Lord will not finally lo&s;e his labour, nor &s;hed his blood in vain. The Prophet declared as po&s;itively that he &s;hould ju&s;tify the <HI>many,</HI> as that he &s;hould <HI>bear their iniquities.</HI> And what the Prophet foretold, the Apo&s;tle confirmed in that prophetic chapter, Rom. v. which may be con&s;ider|ed as the be&s;t comment upon this text that has ever been written. Therein he declares that, <Q>As by the offence of one, Judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even &s;o by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men to ju&s;tifica|tion of life.</Q> ver. 18.</P>
<P>But perhaps &s;ome might &s;ay, This is only general provi&s;ion, and there is no certainty that they &s;hall ever become actual partakers of it. To prevent this, and to te&s;tify the univer&s;al re&s;toration in the plaine&s;t manner, he adds, <Q>For as by one man's di&s;obedi|ence many were made &s;inners, &s;o by the obedi|ence of one &s;hall many be made righteous.</Q>&mdash;ver. 19 Here he a&s;&s;erts, not only that all who be|came corrupted and condemned by the offence of one, have a provi&s;ion made for their ju&s;tification and happine&s;s in Chri&s;t, but that they &s;hall as certainly become righteous at la&s;t, as they have been actually &s;inners. So God hath greatly purpo&s;ed, and his will mu&s;t be done. And to confirm us, if po&s;&s;ible,

&s;till more in this idea, the great Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <Q>Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where &s;in abounded grace did much more abound.</Q> ver. 20. Here the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks like a Prophet, in the &s;ame grand and glorious &s;tile; he &s;peaks of things not yet come to pa&s;s, as though they were already fulfilled, to &s;hew the ab&s;olute cer|tainty of their accompli&s;hment, So God &s;pake to Abraham, <Q>A father of many nations have I made thee.</Q> Gen. xvii. 5.&mdash;Rom. iv. 17. Though at that time I&s;aac was not born; but he was a father of many nations <Q>before him whom he believed, even God who quickeneth the dead, and calleth tho&s;e things that be not, as though they were.</Q> So I&s;aiah &s;ays, <Q>Unto us a child is born, unto us a &s;on is given,</Q> &amp;c. I&s;ai. ix. 6. And hundreds of pa&s;&s;ages might be found of the like nature in the &s;acred writings, which we mu&s;t never interpret by mood and ten&s;e, and &s;uch-like little critici&s;ms.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle to the Hebrews &s;ays, <Q>Thou ha&s;t put all things in &s;ubjection under his feet. For in that he put all in &s;ubjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him.

And the &s;ame rea&s;oning may be applied to the &s;uper|abounding of grace over &s;in; it is done in the &s;ight of God, it certainly &s;hall be compleatly performed at la&s;t, but we do not yet behold it; far from it; &s;in has hitherto abounded much more than grace; but the &s;cale will turn, and grace &s;hall abound much more than &s;in <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">From this text alone an argument may be drawn in fa|vour of the univer&s;al re&s;toration that cannot ea&s;ily be an|&s;wered, and as it has &s;tood in my printed works for nine years, without ever having been fairly an&s;wered, I will take the liberty of tran&s;cribing it here. <Q>It is evident that &s;in has abounded to the de&s;truction of all men; now if grace abounds <HI>much more,</HI> it is evident that all mu&s;t be at la&s;t re&s;tored thereby; otherwi&s;e there is no &s;hadow of truth in the words.

But as though St. Paul was determined that none &s;hould remain ignorant of the matter that &s;hould read this epi&s;tle, he farther adds, <Q>That as &s;in hath reigned unto death, even &s;o might grace reign through righteou&s;ne&s;s unto eternal life, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</Q> ver. 21.</P>
<P>Many will allow that Chri&s;t's redemption is &s;o far for all men as to give them the ble&s;&s;ing of temporal life; but St. Paul here declares that grace &s;hall <HI>reign to eternal life,</HI> even as &s;in hath <HI>reigned unto death:</HI> and none will deny but &s;in hath certainly reigned unto death over all men: (however differently they may explain the word <HI>death</HI>) then grace mu&s;t reign through righteou&s;ne&s;s, unto eternal life, over all men.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t mu&s;t &s;ee of the travail of his &s;oul, and mu&s;t be fully &s;atisfied and contented; and who can tell how capacious the &s;oul of Chri&s;t is?

<P>I &s;hall notice but one more prophecy in the book of I&s;aiah, in favour of the Univer&s;al Re&s;toration; and that (one would think) is enough to convince any unprejudiced mind, that wrath towards all God's creatures, is limited, and mu&s;t at length have an end.</P>
<P><Q>For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the &s;pirit &s;hould fail before me, and the &s;ouls which I have made.</Q> chap. lvii. 10</P>
<P>Here is a general declaration, that God will not contend for ever, neither be always wroth; and for this he gives a plain rea&s;on, founded in his love and pity towards the works of his hands; <HI>the &s;pirit &s;hould fail before me, and the &s;ouls that I have made.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall treat very briefly upon this text, becau&s;e I have dwelt &s;o long upon tho&s;e which I have already con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Some may &s;ay, that God only &s;peaks of his pecu|liar people, that he will not contend with them for|ever, nor be always wroth with his cho&s;en. But it is evident that he &s;peaks of &s;uch who went on frow|ardly in the way of their own hearts; who&s;e ways he &s;aw, and promi&s;ed to heal them, and to re&s;tore com|forts unto them, and to their mourners. And the rea&s;on he gives why he will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth, is general, and founded upon the relation that God &s;tands in to his creatures as
<PB N="34" REF="025049_0034_0FCDAF991E79A6A8">
their Creator and Father. And as he is the Father of all &s;pirits, and Creator of all &s;ouls, the &s;ame rea&s;on in this re&s;pect &s;ub&s;i&s;ts towards all alike. And it is worthy of our notice, that no rea&s;on is given in this text, why he will not contend for ever, not be al|ways wroth, but what equally applies to one as well as another. And I &s;ay now, as I have &s;aid more than once in my writings, <Q>Tho&s;e who venture to contradict their Maker in this a&s;&s;ertion, and &s;ay, that he <HI>will contend forever, and will be always wroth,</HI> ought to be able at lea&s;t to a&s;&s;ign as good a rea&s;on for it, as he has to the contrary, and con&s;e|quently prove him not to be the univer&s;al Maker and Father of mankind.</Q> This would be doing the work effectually, and would lay &s;uch a firm foun|dation for the doctrine of endle&s;s mi&s;ery, as could not ea&s;ily be overthrown. But as this can never be done by Scripture. I think we may affirm with the utmo&s;t certainty, according to this prophecy, that God will not contend with his creatures for ever, nor be always wroth with them; le&s;t the &s;pirit &s;hould fail before him, and the &s;ouls which he hath made. And this text concludes as &s;trongly again&s;t annihilation or de|&s;truction, as it does again&s;t endle&s;s damnation: For in either ca&s;e the &s;pirit mu&s;t fail for ever of attaining to the end for which God de&s;igned it, and it crea|tion would be in vain, and to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Truth is, that God will &s;ubdue <HI>All;</HI> bring every knee to bow, and tongue to &s;wear; and thus as all &s;hall &s;ubmit to him, become reconciled to his government, and obedient to his laws, all contention &s;hall cea&s;e; which cannot be the ca&s;e till all creatures yield to their Creator, as he will never give up any of his rights.</P>
<P><Q>Thy mercy, O JEHOVAH, endureth for ever: for&s;ake not the works of thine own hands.</Q> P&s;alm cxxxviii. 8. It is a great con&s;olation to think that God's mercy endures for ever; and that he will have
<PB N="35" REF="025049_0035_0FCDAFD1549CD330">
a de&s;ire to the works of his hands, and will not for|&s;ake them, until he hath performed all his plea&s;ure, in them and for them; which &s;hall i&s;&s;ue in his own glory, and their felicity.</P>
<P>I &s;hall dwell no longer on the prophecy of I&s;aiah: for though there are many other pa&s;&s;ages therein that intimate the Univer&s;al Re&s;toration, &s;ome of which I have noticed already in this work, yet as other parts of Scripture demand our attention, I &s;hall pa&s;s to mention &s;ome of the mo&s;t material prophecies that are yet to be con&s;idered re&s;pecting this mo&s;t impor|tant event. For though I con&s;ider the texts already cited as &s;ufficient of them&s;elves to prove the doctrine of the Re&s;toration true, yet it mu&s;t give great plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction to the friends of this glorious &s;y&s;tem, to &s;ee a point of this amazing magnitude confirmed by a great number of pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>The prophecy of Jeremiah has not very much in it that appears to me directly to relate to this &s;ubject. He may be called, <HI>The mourning prophet.</HI> His book is chiefly filled with accounts of black crimes, and dreadful judgments; neverthele&s;s there are four or five chapters that contain many very gracious promi|&s;es; yet as they chiefly and mo&s;t directly relate to the happy &s;tate of Judah and I&s;rael in the time of the Millenium, and have been con&s;idered in that light, I &s;hall pa&s;s them over here. For as the Millenium it&s;elf &s;hall in many in&s;tances be a beautiful type and figure of the New Earth, and final happy &s;tate of mankind, and the glorious recovery of the twelve tribes &s;hall be a picture of the general re&s;toration, the &s;ame promi&s;es that confirm the former may in many in&s;tances be applied to the latter event.</P>
<P>That declaration of God by Jeremiah, Chap. iii. 12, <Q>For I am merciful, &s;aith JEHOVAH, and I will not keep anger for ever:</Q> has been already men|tioned among other pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;ame nature; and
<PB N="36" REF="025049_0036_0FCDAF9B0A3F13D0">
well de&s;erves a place here, for it is like the &s;un &s;hin|ing out of a cloud.</P>
<P>And &s;omething of the &s;ame kind appears in the book of lamentations, where we &s;hould lea&s;t expect it. <Q>For JEHOVAH will not ca&s;t off for ever. But though he cau&s;e grief, yet will he have compa&s;&s;ion according to the multitude of his mercies: For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the chil|dren of men.</Q> Lam. iii. 31, 32, 33.</P>
<P>The&s;e words appear to me, to be without limita|tion of time, or per&s;ons. God never afflicts willing|ly, nor grieves the children of men in any &s;tage of their exi&s;tence. Why then doth he afflict and grieve them at all? The an&s;wer is, It is nece&s;&s;ary for their good. This, if admitted as true, &s;ettles the point at once; for if God always afflicts the children of men for their good and never merely for his own plea&s;ure then the doctrine of the Re&s;toration is true. And would it not be ab&s;urd to &s;ay, That although God doth not willingly afflict and grieve the chil|dren of men in this life, but doth all for their good; yet as &s;oon as they depart into another &s;tate of exi&s;t|ence, he afflicts them in the &s;evere&s;t manner, willing|ly, and takes plea&s;ure in putting them to the utmo&s;t torture, without having the lea&s;t eye to their advan|tage? But if it be univer&s;ally true, that he <HI>will not ca&s;t eff for ever;</HI> but although he may cau&s;e grief and &s;orrow for a time, yet finally he <HI>will have com|pa&s;&s;ion, according to the multitude of his mercies,</HI> then there is a glorious de&s;ign, even in his judg|ments, and that de&s;ign can be no other than the re|claiming and re&s;toring his fallen creatures.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal threatenings and promi&s;es made to the &s;ome people and nations in the prophecy of Jeremiah, that I could never reconcile together upon any other plan than the general Re&s;toration: If any per&s;on can do it, I am ready to receive light. I will

ju&s;t mention them, and &s;hew wherein the difficulty lies, and leave them to your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Jer. xlviii. 42. <Q>Moab &s;hall be de&s;troyed from being a people, becau&s;e he hath magnified him&s;elf again&s;t JEHOVAH.</Q> This &s;eems to be a threaten|ing of their total de&s;truction from off the face of the earth: and this is repeated more particularly, and confirmed in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and awful manner by God, in the prophecy of Zephaniah, chap. ii. 8, 9. <Q>I have heard of the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified them&s;elves again&s;t their border. Therefore as I live, &s;aith JEHOVAH of ho&s;ts, the God of I&s;rael, &s;urely Moab &s;hall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and &s;alt-pits, and a perpetual de&s;olation.</Q></P>
<P>This threatening has been executed, and neither the name or nation of Moab or Ammon is to be found on earth, having been totally de&s;troyed, This is con&s;i&s;tent with Jer. xlvi. 28. <Q>Fear thou not, O Jacob my &s;ervant, &s;aith JEHOVAH:: for I am with thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee; but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in mea&s;ure;</Q> &amp;c. Here you &s;ee the di&s;tinction be|tween I&s;rael and other nations, they were to be whol|ly cut off, to be utterly de&s;troyed: a full end was to be made of them, not to Jacob; a &s;eed and remnant had a promi&s;e of being &s;pared and pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>But the&s;e &s;ame nations of Moab and Ammen that are thus threatened with total and final de&s;truction, and who do not exi&s;t on earth at pre&s;ent, are promi|&s;ed a re&s;toration, and return of their captivity in the latter days, <Q>Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab, in the latter days, faith JEHOVAH,</Q> Jer. xlviii. 47.&mdash; <Q>And afterwards I will bring again
<PB N="38" REF="025049_0038_0FCDAF9CF4FF98B0">
the captivity of the children of Ammon, faith JEHOVAH.</Q> chap. xlix. 6.</P>
<P>The &s;ame threatnings and promi&s;es are made to Elam, <Q>I will cau&s;e Elam to be di&s;mayed before their enemies, and before them that &s;eek their life; and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, &s;aith JEHOVAH: and I will &s;end the &s;word after them, till I have con&s;umed them.</Q> chap. xlix. 37. Here is a full declaration of their being totally con&s;umed from the face of the earth.</P>
<P><Q>But it &s;hall come to pa&s;s in the latter days that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, &s;aith JEHOVAH.</Q> ver. 39.</P>
<P>Now if any can &s;hew how the captivity of nations that long ago have entirely peri&s;hed from the earth can be returned in the latter days, unle&s;s the &s;y&s;tem of the new earth and the re&s;toration be true, I &s;hould for one be glad to be informed of it. In the mean time, as I cannot &s;ee how the&s;e promi&s;es can be ful|filled re&s;pecting Moab, Ammon and Elam, (as it is evident they never yet have been) unle&s;s their re&s;to|ration in the manner I have laid it down is true; &s;o I can &s;ee no rea&s;on why the&s;e three nations &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t that have in like manner peri&s;hed; and therefore I conclude that they are men|tioned as &s;pecimens and examples, and that the whole &s;hall be &s;harers together of the future re&s;toration and deliverance, even as they have &s;hared together in puni&s;hment and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t remarkable prophecy of this kind is found in Ezekiel, chap. xvi. where God &s;peaks of the &s;ins of Sodom, and her daughters, the cities of the plain: and mentions that he took them away, as he &s;aw good, by fire and brim&s;tone from heaven; which was a fact well known through the world at the time it happened, and was a dreadful warning to
<PB N="39" REF="025049_0039_0FCDAFD54A998428">
all nations to avoid &s;in. The &s;ins of Sodom and her daughters, are compared with the &s;ins of Jeru&s;a|lem and her daughters, and the crimes of the latter are found far to exceed, both in number and malig|nity, and being committed gain&s;t greater light and love, were much more aggravated. Yet God pro|mi&s;es to bring again the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, the cities of the plan; Samaria and-her daughters, the cities of I&s;rael; and Jeru&s;alem and her daughters, the cities of Judah, at the &s;ame time, and that they &s;hould embrace each other in the arms of love and &s;incere affection. And akhough the idea of the re&s;toration of the per&s;ons of Samaria and Jeru&s;alem might be evaded, by &s;aying that the re|turn of their de&s;cendants was intended, yet no &s;uch eva&s;ion can be u&s;ed re&s;pecting Sodom and her daugh|ters, as they were wholly de&s;troyed by fire and brim|&s;tone, and none of them e&s;caped, and con&s;equently not one of their de&s;cendants is now on earth. The re&s;toration of tho&s;e very per&s;ons of Sodom. &amp;c. who were de&s;troyed, being here intended, (for what el&s;e can po&s;&s;ibly be meant?) we are obliged to under|&s;tand the return of the captivity of Jeru&s;alem and Samaria here mentioned, in the &s;ame manner, for the re&s;toration of tho&s;e very &s;inners of tho&s;e cities, who were de&s;troyed and cut off for their great tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions; or el&s;e how can they know, receive, and delight in each other?</P>
<P>This glorious return of their captivity as de&s;cribed in this chapter, I refer to the new earth; after the judgment, and conflagration, and the ages of puni&s;h|ment are pa&s;t. Then all the nations of the old earth &s;till become inhabitants of the new, and their long captivity under the wor&s;t of tyrants, &s;in, death, hell and pain, &s;hall be returned in the highe&s;t and be&s;t &s;en&s;e of the words; which is indeed the only fair and rea&s;onable &s;en&s;e, as far as I can &s;ee, that can be put upon the words.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="025049_0040_0FCDAF9F692B8D00">I might &s;ay much more here, but as my de&s;ign is to di&s;cour&s;e upon the&s;e very remarkable predictions of Ezekiel re&s;pecting Sodom, Samaria, and Jeru&s;a|lem, and their daughters by them&s;elves, I &s;hall &s;ay no more upon that &s;ubject now, but &s;hall refer you to the words of the prophecy. Ezek. xvi. 44&mdash;63 And if after reading and attentively con&s;idering the matter, you can make any thing el&s;e to be the mean|ing of the words &s;o as to hold and run through the whole in harmony and perfect con&s;i&s;tency, then you will perform a ta&s;k to which I have never yet found any per&s;on equal, whether by word or writing; and, from what I have &s;een hitherto, I am ready to judge is morally impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Ezekiel has many wonderful pa&s;&s;ages, wherein the greate&s;t mercies are promi&s;ed to &s;ucceed the mo&s;t terrible judgments, and many wherein it is expre&s;sly intimated that the end and great de&s;ign of God in all the de&s;tructions threatened is, <HI>that they might know</HI> JEHOVAH; and this being a &s;alutary and &s;aving knowledge, I take all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages as proofs of the final re&s;toration of tho&s;e who are thus de&s;troyed on purpose, &s;eemingly, that they might know the Lord. (See in this light P&s;al. ixxxiii. and the ob&s;ervations which I have made upon the &s;ame.)</P>
<P>But as I have taken notice of many of the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages already in the cour&s;e of the Lectures, and as this di&s;cour&s;e has been already long, and I have &s;ome|thing yet to add to it, I &s;hall take my leave for the pre&s;ent of this excellent Prophet, who&s;e prophecies have afforded me abundance of delight and improve|ment.</P>
<P>Daniel's prophecy is the next that we come to: he &s;peaks of the kingdom which Chri&s;t &s;hall receive of the Father, <Q>And there was given him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages &s;hould &s;erve him; his dominion
<PB N="41" REF="025049_0041_0FCDAFD677535C50">
is an everla&s;ting dominion, which &s;hall not pa&s;s away, and his kingdom that which &s;hall not be de&s;troyed. The &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High &s;hall take the kingdom, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s; the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatne&s;s of the kingdom under the whole heaven &s;hall be given to the people of the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High; who&s;e kingdom is an everla&s;ting kingdom, and all dominions &s;hall &s;erve and obey him.</Q> Dan. vii. 14, 18, 27.</P>
<P>The Prophet declares that all people, nations and languages &s;hall &s;erve the glorious Me&s;&s;iah, when he &s;hall come in glory, and that the &s;aints &s;hall po&s;&s;es the kingdom <HI>for ever,</HI> or for an age, which &s;hall be in the Millenium, when they &s;hall reign with Chri&s;t a thou&s;and years; <HI>even for ever and ever,</HI> or for ages of ages; the&s;e periods carry us far beyond the Mille|nium, even to the new earth, where Chri&s;t and his &s;aints &s;hall reign together for ages of ages, before the kingdom &s;hall be delivered up to the Father, that God may be all in all. And during the conti|nuance of this kingdom, all adver&s;e powers mu&s;t be brought into &s;ubjection, for Chri&s;t mu&s;t reign till all his enemies are put under his feet. See Rev. xxii. 5. compared with 1 Cor. xv. 24&mdash;28. And as the de&s;ign of this kingdom of ages, after the judgment, is to re&s;tore and make all things new, (as I have &s;hewn,) therefore the&s;e prophecies of Daniel mu&s;t be under&s;tood to reach to that glorious period when God &s;hall be all in all, <HI>and all dominions &s;hall &s;erve and obey him.</HI> And this to me appears to include their return to God and goodne&s;s, and con&s;equently to happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Ho&s;ea is a wonderful prophet to reconcile Judg|ment and mercy together; the mo&s;t dreadful threat|enings are denounced again&s;t the &s;ame people and per&s;ons to whom afterwards the greate&s;t promi&s;es are made. This in my opinion, can only be reconciled
<PB N="42" REF="025049_0042_0FCDAFA5474BB0E8">
upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that judgement &s;hall be finally &s;ucceeded by mercy. To one that never read the prophet Ho&s;ea with this view, his writing mu&s;t ap|pear a continued chain of contradictions.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t chapter God &s;ays, <Q>I will no more have mercy upon the hou&s;e of I&s;rael. Ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.</Q> ver. 6, 9. Yet directly after it is added, <Q>And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s that in the place where it was &s;aid unto them, Ye are not my people, there it &s;hall be &s;aid unto them, Ye are the &s;ons of the living God.</Q> ver. 10.</P>
<P>By the threatenings we &s;hould conclude that no mercy could po&s;&s;ibly reach them, but when we turn our attention to the promi&s;es we &s;ee cau&s;e to change our mind.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd chapter God promi&s;es to betroth tho&s;e to him for ever, whom before he declared that he had ca&s;t entirely off, yea, to betroth them in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and in judgment, and in loving-kind|ne&s;s, and in mercies; yea, even to betroth them to him&s;elf in faithfulne&s;s, and to give them to know him, whom to know is life eternal: And farther he &s;ays, <Q>And I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will &s;ay to them who were not my people, Thou art my people, and they &s;hall &s;ay, Thou art my God.</Q> See ver. 19, 20.23. And the apo&s;tle explains this as con&s;tituting them heirs of &s;alvation, and ve&s;&s;els of mercy, on whom he would make the riches of his glory known, though before they had been ve&s;&s;els of wrath: and to this purpo&s;e he quotes the&s;e very pa&s;&s;ages, &s;aying, <Q>As he faith in O&s;ee, I will call them My people, who were not my people; and her Beloved, who was not beloved. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that in the place where it was &s;aid unto them, Ye are not my people; there &s;hall they be called The
<PB N="43" REF="025049_0043_0FCDAFDB107DC570">
children of the living God.</Q> Rom. ix. 25, 26. And con&s;equently tho&s;e &s;ame per&s;ons who were re|jected &s;hall become heirs of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>In chap. iv. 17. it is &s;aid, <Q>Ephraim is joined to idols, let him alone.</Q> This looks dark, as though God had left Ephraim to him&s;elf to be eter|nally undone.</P>
<P>In the vth chapter, it is &s;aid, <Q>And the pride of I&s;rael, doth te&s;tify to his face: therefore &s;hall I&s;rael and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah al&s;o &s;hall fall with them. They &s;hall go with their &s;locks and their herds to &s;eek JEHOVAH; but they &s;hall not find him; he hath withdraw him|&s;elf from them.</Q> ver. 5, 6. There would ap|pear little or no hope of the recovery of tho&s;e who &s;hall fall in their iniquity, and who &s;hall &s;eek JEHO|VAH and &s;hall not find him, from whom he hath withdrawn him&s;elf. And the threatening is expre&s;&s;ed in a &s;till more terrible manner towards the clo&s;e of the chapter, <Q>For I will be unto Ephraim as lion, and as a young lion to the hou&s;e of Judah: I even I will tear and go away, I will take away, and none &s;hall re&s;cue him</Q> ver. 14. Who would not be ready to conclude from this ver&s;e, that certainly the&s;e people were undone and lo&s;t for ever? and e&s;pecially &s;ince God by the &s;ame prophet &s;ays, <Q>Yea, woe al&s;o to them when I depart from them!</Q> Chap. ix. 12. Inevitable and eternal de&s;truction, would &s;eem their portion, and that God once departed in &s;uch an awful manner, would never return again. But the 15th ver&s;e of the vth chapter, changes the &s;cene, declares the intention of God in withdrawing him&s;elf, and &s;hews plainly that it is only for a time, till the divine purpo&s;e therein &s;hall be fulfilled. <Q>I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and &s;eek my face: in their affliction they will &s;eek me early.</Q> This pa&s;&s;age di&s;pels the gloom, and &s;hews thst God has a de&s;ign in all his
<PB N="44" REF="025049_0044_0FCDAFA650710BA0">
judgments, even to bring offenders to feel and ac|knowledge them&s;elves guilty, and to &s;eek his face; then his mercy &s;hall be di&s;played, and he will return to them again with his loving favour.</P>
<P>This is the con&s;tant tenor of the book, all the way through: but I mu&s;t only mention &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>Chap. vii. 13. <Q>Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: de&s;truction unto them! becau&s;e they have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have &s;poken lies again&s;t me,</Q> This pa&s;&s;age (as well as mo&s;t others in this prophecy) repre&s;ents them as the mo&s;t wicked apo&s;tates, and abandoned &s;inners, and that de&s;truc|tion was their certain portion; and in chap. x. 8. the Lord &s;ays, <Q>And they &s;hall &s;ay to the moun|tains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</Q> And yet, O how kindly does God &s;peak of this &s;ame people in chap. xi. even when he had their ba&s;e&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions full in view? <Q>And my people are bent to back&s;liding from me: though they called them to the Mo&s;t High, none at all would ex|alt him.</Q> This was very grievous, and highly provoking; but what are the next words? <Q>How &s;hall I give thee up, Ephraim? how &s;hall I deli|ver thee, I&s;rael? how &s;hall I make thee as Ad|mah? how &s;hall I &s;et thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kind|led together. I will not execute the fiercene&s;s of mine anger, I will not return to de&s;troy Ephraim: for I am God and not man; the Holy One in the mid&s;t of thee.</Q> ver. 7, 8, 9.</P>
<P>In Chap. xiii. God &s;ets forth his loving kindne&s;&s;es towards them, then their great ingratitude and rebel|lion, and then he threatens them in the mo&s;t &s;evere and dreadful manner, and then immediately promi|&s;es to help, heal, recover, ran&s;om, and re&s;tore them.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="025049_0045_0FCDAFDD0050E308">
&mdash;<Q>Yet I am JEROYAH, thy God, from the land of Egypt, and thou &s;halt know no God but me: for there is no &s;aviour be&s;ide me. I did know thee in the wilderne&s;s, in the land of great drought. According to their pa&s;ture, &s;o were they filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me. Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I ob&s;erve them. I will meet them as a bear bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart. and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild bea&s;t &s;hall tear them.</Q> ver. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Words can hardly be more terrible: the threatenings are of the mo&s;t dreadful kind, and we &s;hould be apt to think it impo&s;&s;ible that any help or deliverance could ever be found for a people &s;o &s;inful, and whom God &s;eems engaged utterly to de&s;troy, and that without remedy. Yet the very next words, are kind expre&s;|&s;ions of grace and mercy, and afford hopes of help and &s;alvation, <Q>O I&s;rael, thou ha&s;t de&s;troyed thy|&s;elf; but in me is thine help. I will be thy king: where is any other that may &s;ave thee in all thy cities?</Q> ver. 9, 10.</P>
<P>Now how are the&s;e promi&s;es con&s;i&s;tent with the threatenings immediately before, unle&s;s the doctrine of the re&s;toration be true? how is it po&s;&s;ible that both can be accompli&s;hed upon any other &s;y&s;tem? yet both mo&s;t be fulfilled, one as well as the other; or el&s;e they are not equally alike true.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of Ephraim is again repre&s;ented as mo&s;t de&s;perate and deplorable, in&s;omuch that death and hell, or entire de&s;truction, mu&s;t be their inevitable portion; <Q>The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his &s;in is hid.

Nothing can be more finely imagined to &s;et forth the mi&s;era|ble
<PB N="46" REF="025049_0046_0FCDAFA7CA54A740">
condition of tho&s;e who are confirmed in their &s;ins, and who have trifled away their time, and fooli&s;hly neglected the &s;ea&s;on of grace, wherein they might have been delivered, and as it were borne out of &s;in and mi&s;ery, into a &s;tate of peace and &s;elicity; they are compared to children who have come to the birth, but who by not coming forth in time, peri&s;h and die without remedy. Yet even this &s;tate of Ephraim &s;hall not fru&s;trate the divine coun&s;els; though death and hell have &s;wallowed them up as their lawful prey; and they to all human appearance are gone for ever, beyond the reach of mercy or hope. But what &s;ays God? <Q>I will ran&s;om them from the power of the grave,</Q> (or hell, the original word being the &s;ame for both) <Q>I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues, O grave, (or hell) I will be thy de&s;truction: repentance &s;hall be hid from mine eyes.</Q> ver. 14.</P>
<P>Here we find that in&s;tead of death and hell de|&s;troying Ephraim for ever, as we might have ex|pected from the preceding words, God declares that he will finally ran&s;om Ephraim from the power of hell, and will redeem them from all that bears the lateful name of <HI>death;</HI> and to put the matter cut of all doubt, and to &s;hew that it is his intention to de|liver all from the&s;e tyrants, he promi&s;es, to de&s;troy them without repentance, that &s;o they may never be able to receive or hold any more captives. When this prophecy &s;hall be fulfilled, <Q>There &s;hall be no more death, neither &s;orrow, nor crying, neither &s;hall there be any more pain:</Q> all things &s;hall be made new, and God &s;hall wipe away all tears from off all faces, and death of every kind &s;hall be wholly &s;wallowed up of victory. See Rev. xxi. 4, 5. com|pared with I&s;aiah xxv. 8. 1 Cor. xv. 54, 55.</P>
<P>Then God &s;hall &s;ay of Ephraim, <Q>I will heal their back&s;liding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.</Q> Ho&s;ea xiv. 4.

<HEAD><HI>LECTURE II.</HI> New Te&s;tament prophecies in favour of the doctrine of the Univer&s;al Re&s;toration.</HEAD>
<P>IN the la&s;t Lecture I ranged over the prophecies of the Old Te&s;tament in favour of the General Re&s;toration, as far as the prophecy of Ho&s;ea. I had intended to give a &s;ketch of it from the wri|tings of all God's holy prophets, by who&s;e mouth St. Peter a&s;&s;ures us, that God hath &s;poken of the Re&s;titution of all things ever &s;ince the world began. Acts iii. 21.</P>
<P>But pa&s;&s;ing over the re&s;t of the minor prophets, without any ob&s;ervations upon what they have &s;aid re&s;pecting this important &s;ubject, I &s;hall come im|mediately to the writings of the evangeli&s;ts and apo&s;|tles of our Lord, and attend to what they and their Ma&s;ter have declared on this head. But let me here adverti&s;e you, that you are not to expect that I &s;hall con&s;ider all that the New Te&s;tament writers have advanced in favour of it, but only tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which I con&s;ider is propherical, to which I &s;hall briefly attend.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="025049_0049_0FCDAFE60A87B978">
The fir&s;t prophecy that we meet with on this &s;ub|ject, is St. Matt. i. 21. <Q>And &s;he &s;hall bring forth a &s;on, and thou &s;hall call his name JESUS, for be &s;hall &s;ave his people from their &s;ins.</Q></P>
<P>This all-benignant prophecy is a counterpart to Gen. iii. 15. We find one at the beginning of the Old Te&s;tament, and the other at the beginning of the New. The&s;e two pa&s;&s;ages are the foundation &s;tones of the great doctrine of &s;alvation; and all other prophecies re&s;pecting this matter, are but larger comments and explications of them. We &s;ee by comparing the&s;e texts together, that the <HI>Seed of the Woman,</HI> and the <HI>Virgin's Son,</HI> are the &s;ame per&s;on, and JESUS is the Saviour's name. One prophecy declares that <HI>He &s;hall brui&s;e the Serpent's head,</HI> or de|&s;troy the devil and his works: and the other, that <HI>He &s;hall &s;ave his people from their &s;ins.</HI></P>
<P>If all men are his people, and the &s;heep of his pa&s;ture, and the purcha&s;e of his blood, and were given to him by the Father, then this prophecy is plainly and fully to the purpo&s;e, and clearly proves the final re&s;toration and deliverance of all men from their &s;ins, and of cour&s;e from their mi&s;eries; and &s;hall as certainly be ab&s;olutely fulfilled as any predic|tion was ever ju&s;tified by its corre&s;ponding event.</P>
<P>Need I &s;pend time here, to prove that all men are the people of our Lord and Saviour, in all the&s;e re&s;|pects? <Q>All things were made by him; and with|out him was not any thing made that was made. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</Q>. St. John i. 3.10.</P>

<P><Q>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, vi&s;ible, and invi&s;i|ble,

whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him.</Q> Col. i. 16.</P>
<P><Q>God hath in the&s;e la&s;t days &s;poken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom al&s;o he con&s;tituted the ages. Who being the brightne&s;s of his glory, and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by him&s;elf purged our &s;ins, &s;at down on the right hand of the Maje&s;ty on high.</Q> Heb. i. 1, 2, 3.</P>
<P>It appears to me from the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, that if crea|tion and pre&s;ervation can make it proper for Chri&s;t to call all mankind his people, then they all are his people, in the&s;e re&s;pects, at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>And if this be denied by any who think lower of JESUS than I do, and who may &s;ay, that the works of creation and providence ought not to be a&s;cribed to him in any &s;en&s;e, yet they will allow that the Father was proprietor of all things; and if he gave, or giveth them to his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they are neverthele&s;s truly and properly his. Let us view the Scriptures on this head, and we &s;hall have rea&s;on to acknowledge that all men are certainly the people of Je&s;us; and con&s;equently he &s;hall &s;ave all mankind from their &s;ins.</P>

<Q>As thou ha&s;t given him power over all fle&s;h, that he &s;hould give eternal life to as many as thou ha&s;t given him.</Q> chap. xvii. 2.</P>
<P>The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages all relate to the &s;ame thing: there is indeed &s;ome little difference in the expre&s;&s;ions: but as the words <HI>delivered</HI> and <HI>given,</HI> are perfectly &s;y|nonymous, as all mu&s;t allow, there can be no differ|ence in the meaning. All things are given into the hands of JESUS; they were pre&s;ented to him by the Father, and he hath univer&s;al power over them. <HI>All men</HI> are certainly included in the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>all things;</HI> though <HI>all things</HI> may include much more than <HI>all men.</HI></P>
<P>So that all men are the people of JESUS, as they are given him by the Father, and delivered into his gracious hands for the be&s;t of purpo&s;es and as he has power given him over them all: as he him&s;elf &s;ays, <Q>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</Q> St. Matt. xxviii. 18.</P>
<P>All men are Chri&s;t's people, ina&s;much as he took part of the common fle&s;h and blood of all; and thus the birth of Je&s;us was good news to all, and was &s;o proclaimed by the angel. <Q>Fear not: for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, who is Chri&s;t the Lord. Glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</Q> St. Luke ii. 10, 11, 14.</P>
<P>If all men were not intere&s;ted in the &s;alvation of Chri&s;t, how could his birth be good news of great joy to all people?</P>
<P>But there is another &s;en&s;e in which all men are the people of JESUS. He died for all, and purcha&s;ed them with his own precious blood, which he freely

&s;hed on the cro&s;s for their redemption; as is evident from the following plain texts.</P>
<BIBL>2 Cor. v. 14, 15.</BIBL>
<Q>For the love of Chri&s;t con|&s;traineth us; becau&s;e we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And he died for all, that they who live &s;hould not henceforth live unto them&s;elves, but unto him who died for them and ro&s;e again.</Q>
<BIBL>1 Tim. ii. 5, 6.</BIBL>
<Q>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us; Who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time.</Q>
<BIBL>Heb. ii. 2.</BIBL>
<Q>But we &s;ee Je&s;us, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the &s;uffering of death, crowned with glory and honour: that he by the grace of God &s;hould ta&s;te death for every man.</Q>
<BIBL>1 John, ii. 1, 2.</BIBL>
<Q>And if any man &s;in we have an advocate with the Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous: And he is the propitiation for our &s;ins: and not for our's only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the whole world.</Q>
<P>Chri&s;t having bought all men with his own blood, they are not their own, they belong to him, who died for their &s;ins, and was rai&s;ed again for their ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>All men are the people of JESUS, fora&s;much as he maketh interce&s;&s;ion for all, is engaged in their cau&s;e, and intere&s;ts him&s;elf in their behalf.</P>
<P>Thus in all the&s;e in&s;tances all men are the people of Je&s;us, and therefore if this prophecy be true, he &s;hall &s;ave all men from their &s;ins.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="025049_0053_0FCDAFF257111B08">He &s;hall &s;ave his people from their &s;ins. But all men are his people: Therefore he &s;hall &s;ave all men from their &s;ins.</P>
<P>I have taken &s;ome pains in the con&s;ideration of this prophecy of the angel, as it is very important; and if I have proved my premi&s;es, the con&s;equences are evident.</P>
<P>The next prophecy that I &s;hall notice under this head, is that of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who was the greate&s;t Prophet that ever &s;pake to men; and who&s;e words are all words of the greate&s;t truth, and cannot fail of being accompli&s;hed at la&s;t.</P>
<P>St. John, vi. 37, 38, 39. <Q>All that the Father giveth me, &s;hall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that &s;ent me. And this is the Father's will who hath &s;ent me, that of all which he hath given me I &s;hould lo&s;e nothing, but &s;hould rai&s;e it up again at the la&s;t day.</Q></P>
<P>It hath been before proved, from the plaine&s;t texts, that all things were given to Chri&s;t and delivered to him of the Father; and here he declares that all &s;hall come to him in &s;uch a manner as not to be ca&s;t out. And that as the Father, on the one hand, hath given him all, &s;o on the other hand, he hath en|gaged to bring all back to God again, according to his will. And he a&s;&s;ures us that the will of the Father is that of all which he hath given to his Son, he &s;hould lo&s;e nothing; and as the Saviour came down from heaven to perform this will of the Father, there can be no doubt but it &s;hall be accom|pli&s;hed at la&s;t.</P>
<P>As for the &s;mall variation of the words from <HI>given</HI> to <HI>giveth,</HI> of which &s;ome would fain take advantage,
<PB N="55" REF="025049_0054_0FCDAFF44E1915C8">
as though Chri&s;t did not mean ju&s;t the &s;ame here, by <HI>giveth,</HI> as where he u&s;ed the words <HI>given</HI> and <HI>deliver|ed,</HI> it is nothing to the purpo&s;e; for as the &s;en&s;e is perfectly the &s;ame, and differs only in the timing of the verb, it &s;hews the weakne&s;s of the cau&s;e which depends upon &s;uch critici&s;ms. For whether the words, <HI>giveth, hath given,</HI> or <HI>&s;hall give,</HI> are u&s;ed, the &s;en&s;e is the &s;ame; for the prophets frequently &s;ub&s;titute one ten&s;e for another, as has been &s;hewn in many in&s;tances; the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> for the <HI>future,</HI> and the <HI>pa&s;t</HI> for the <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This prophecy of our Lord, is very important and intere&s;ting, and certainly holds forth great things, and to me appears &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h the doctrine of the Re&s;toration. God's will is, that all men &s;hall be &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. i Tim. ii. 4. This will of God our Saviour came to perform: and it &s;hall finally be accompli&s;hed, however long it may be re&s;i&s;ted, and apparently fru&s;|trated. All things and con&s;equently all men, belong to Chri&s;t, being given to him by the Father; and all that the Father giveth to Chri&s;t &s;hall come to him in &s;uch a manner as in no wi&s;e to be ca&s;t our, and &s;hall therefore be &s;aved by him.</P>
<P>The next prophecy of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour that I &s;hall con&s;ider, is that which is written in St. John xii. 32. <Q>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me;</Q> our glorious Re|deemer, that great Prophet, had often before pro|phe&s;ied of his death, and of the manner and circum|&s;tances thereof: He had foretold that he &s;hould be betrayed into the hands of &s;inful men, and that they &s;hould mock, &s;courge, and crucify him; that he &s;hould &s;uffer a violent death, and the third day &s;hould ri&s;e again. The&s;e things he had frequently mention|ed: But in this text he utters a grand prediction of what &s;hould be the con&s;equence of his being thus lifted up, <HI>as Mo&s;es lifted up the &s;erpent in the wil|derne&s;s;</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="025049_0055_0FCDAFF64CB95AD0">
viz. that he &s;hould certainly at la&s;t draw all men unto him&s;elf. This was a part of the joy that Was &s;et before him, and for the &s;ake of which he en|dured the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame. He beheld in pro&s;pect Satan's empire fallen and de&s;troyed; and all brought back again to God, being drawn by him in due &s;ea&s;on; for as he <Q>gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time;</Q> (1 Tim. ii. 6.) &s;o he will draw all unto him&s;elf in the fulne&s;s of the ages: for <Q>he &s;hall &s;ee of the travail of his &s;oul, and &s;hall be &s;atisfied:</Q> He &s;hall ju&s;tify the multi|tude who&s;e iniquities he hath borne. I&s;ai. liii. 11.</P>
<P>This is the reward which he was to have for all his pain and &s;orrow. And who that loves Je&s;us, would wi&s;h him to be deprived of that infinite and inconoeivable plea&s;ure which he mu&s;t have in &s;eeing all men come to him, and obtain eternal life, through his &s;ufferings and death?</P>
<P>It was for this rea&s;on that he had power given him over all fle&s;h, that he &s;hould give eternal life to all, without, exception, whom, the Father had given him; St. John xvii. 2. And if any thing can be proved from expre&s;s words of Scripture, it is plain that all things were given into his hands for that very purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>There are two or three ways that tho&s;e who are aver&s;e to the doctrine of the General Re&s;toration en|deavour to evade or de&s;troy the force of this pro|phecy which I am now upon; but the attempts are &s;o weak they are hardly worth notice. One is this, that <HI>all</HI> doth not intend <HI>all without exception.</HI> But this is an&s;wered by St. Paul, Heb. ii. 8. <Q>Thou ha&s;t put all things in &s;ubjection under hit feet. For in that he put all in &s;ubjection under him, ME LEFT NOTHING THAT IS NOT PUT UNDER him.</Q> So that having the judgment of &s;uch a
<PB N="57" REF="025049_0056_0FCDAFF806A08880">
rea&s;oner as St. Paul on my &s;ide, I &s;hall be very little concerned at this eva&s;ion.</P>
<P>Others &s;ay, that nothing more was intended by our Lord in this prediction, but that if he was lifted up on the cro&s;s, a great multitude of people would be drawn together to behold him. This is a pretty conceit indeed! &s;o &s;uppo&s;e our Lord ju&s;t having heard a voice from heaven, &s;hould comfort him&s;elf with this con&s;olation tending &s;o greatly to mitigate his &s;ufferings! What &s;hould we think of our Lord if we could receive this as the meaning of the text? We &s;hould always take care not to indulge low and unworthy, mean and little ideas of the words of Chri&s;t. Would you not think a man bereaved of his rea&s;on, or exceedingly hardened and trifling, who being doomed to &s;uffer a cruel and very &s;hameful as well as painful death, &s;hould con&s;ole him&s;elf with the thought, that a va&s;t number of &s;pectators &s;hould be pre&s;ent to behold him &s;uffer? The idea is too ridi|culous to dwell upon.</P>
<P>There are others who &s;ay the meaning of the words mu&s;t be that Chri&s;t will draw all men before his judgment &s;eat. But why was this connected with his &s;uffering death on the cro&s;s? The words mu&s;t intend a kind of drawing of all men that could not have taken place unle&s;s he had &s;uffered that kind of death; and al&s;o &s;uch an event as gave him the high|e&s;t po&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure, and encouraged him to bear his &s;ufferings for the &s;ake of &s;eeing its accompli&s;hment. Now both the&s;e ideas meet, if Je&s;us &s;hall draw all men without exception to him&s;elf, to be &s;aved, but not el&s;e.</P>
<P>For it is through (or in con&s;equence of) his death upon the cro&s;s that men &s;hall be drawn to him to be &s;aved; and this &s;hall afford him the highe&s;t plea|&s;ure. In con&s;equence of his thus humbling him&s;elf, and becoming obedient unto death, even the death
<PB N="58" REF="025049_0057_0FCDAFFBE39E2618">
of the cro&s;s, he hath the highe&s;t glory, honour, and power given to him as Mediator; and &s;hall have the plea&s;ure of drawing all to him&s;elf, of &s;aving all from their &s;ins. And in his name every knee &s;hall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and every tongue &s;hall confe&s;s that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord, to the glory of God the Fa|ther. Phil. ii. 10, 11. And as <Q>no man can &s;ay that Je&s;us is the Lord, but by the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> 1 Cor. xii. 3. and as all &s;hall truly confe&s;s him Lord, to the glory of God the Father, it follows that all &s;hall &s;o come to Chri&s;t as to be &s;aved by him; which was the thing to be proved. Thus he that was lifted up on the cro&s;s &s;hall attract all men to him&s;elf, for the mo&s;t glorious purpo&s;es; and &s;hall reveal the glory of the Lord to them, "And all fle&s;h &s;hall &s;ee the &s;alvation of God." St. Luke, iii. 6.</P>
<P><Q>Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the &s;in of the world!</Q> St. John i. 29. <Q>For God &s;o loved, the world, that he gave his only begot|ten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life. For God &s;ent not his &s;on into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be &s;aved.</Q> Chap. iii. 16, 17.</P>
<P><Q>We know that this is indeed the Chri&s;t, the Sa|viour of the world</Q> chap. iv. 42.</P>
<P>This is a mo&s;t glorious view of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t; and con&s;idered as nece&s;&s;ary in order to draw all men to him to be &s;aved, they are highly impor|tant.</P>
<P>There are many other &s;ayings among the words of Chri&s;t &s;avourable to the doctrine of the univer&s;al re&s;toration; but as the three prophecies I have al|ready con&s;idered are very full and plain to the pur|po&s;e, I &s;hall leave them to your meditation, and pro|ceed
<PB N="59" REF="025049_0058_0FCDAFFE14BAF220">
to mention a few of tho&s;e prophetical &s;ayings written by the Apo&s;tles upon this head.</P>
<P>The only pa&s;&s;age I &s;hall notice in the book of Acts, is chap. iii. 20, 21. <Q>And he &s;hall &s;end Je|&s;us who before was preached unto you; Whom the heavene mu&s;t receive until the times of the re&s;titution of all things, which God hath &s;poken by the mouth of all his holy prophets &s;ince the world began.</Q></P>
<P>The re&s;titution of all things is a truth, or there could be no times and &s;ea&s;ons appointed for it. The re&s;titution of all things includes the re&s;toration of man. This is one of the great &s;ubjects of prophecy. God hath not only revealed it in general, but hath &s;poken of it by the mouth of all his holy prophets &s;ince the world began. Therefore it is revealed in the old te&s;tament as well as in the new. It was &s;po|ken by the prophets, and confirmed by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, and is a &s;ubject of the greate&s;t impor|tance of any in all prophecy, &s;ince God hath declared it from the beginning, and it hath been revealed to all his prophets. It is very clear that it doth not re|&s;er to any thing that hath already taken place, &s;ince our Lord and Saviour mu&s;t come from heaven to perform the important work. Re&s;titution of all things is bringing every thing back to as good a &s;tate, at lea&s;t, as that wherein they were placed at fir&s;t by God. It is mo&s;t certainly a change for the better, and never for the wor&s;e. This important work is not to be done in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, but in times, &s;ea&s;ons, and ages, and every thing in its proper order.</P>
<P>The&s;e propo&s;itions appear to me naturally to ri&s;e out of the text, and many di&s;cour&s;es might be writ|ten from them.</P>
<P>Some have &s;aid, that the Re&s;titution of all things in this pa&s;&s;age cannot mean what I have &s;uppo&s;ed it
<PB N="60" REF="025049_0059_0FCDB00059C90B30">
doth, and only refers to the di&s;pen&s;ation of grace in the pre&s;ent time before the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t, becau&s;e he mu&s;t be retained in the heavens until the times of Re&s;titution of all things <HI>are pa&s;t;</HI> (as they would explain the words:) But as no &s;uch idea is proved from the text, the general te&s;timony of &s;crip|ture gives me authority to &s;ay that Chri&s;t &s;hall be re|tained in the heavens until the times, ages, or &s;ea&s;ons of Re&s;titution <HI>arrive,</HI> or <HI>commence;</HI> but by no means till they end; as &s;uch a propo&s;ition would be entire|ly contrary to the whole &s;y&s;tem of prophecy</P>
<P>The next prophecy in order upon this great &s;ub|ject is Rom. v. 18, 19, 20, 21. But this I have al|ready con&s;idered. Let none &s;ay that this is no pro|phecy: for the expre&s;&s;ions, <Q>&s;o by the obedience of one &s;hall many be made righteous;</Q> are as true and po&s;itive a prophecy, as it is a melancholy fact, that <Q>by one man's di&s;obedience many were made &s;inners.</Q> If one be a true hi&s;tory, the other is of con&s;equence a true prophecy. <Q>Where &s;in abound|ed grace did much more abound:</Q> is a glorious prophecy that puts the pa&s;t ten&s;e for the future, to &s;hew the ab&s;olute certainty of its fulfilment, as though it was already done. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be a prophecy, for there never yet was a time when grace abounded as much as &s;in, far le&s;s <HI>much more.</HI></P>
<P>Sin hath reigned unto death: this is certain; &s;o &s;hall grace reign through righteou&s;ne&s;s; not only &s;o far as to make eternal life po&s;&s;ible to all, but certain for all, or el&s;e the reign of grace would not be &s;o ex|ten&s;ive and powerful as that of &s;in.</P>
<P>I come next to that very grand and glorious pro|phecy, Rom. viii. 21. <Q>Becau&s;e the creature it|&s;elf al&s;o &s;hall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the chil|dren of God.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="025049_0060_0FCDB00225D43828">I &s;hall take the liberty of reading the foregoing and following ver&s;es and the brief remarks which I made upon them in my fermon, called, <HI>The Go&s;pel preached by the Apo&s;tles.</HI></P>

For we know that the whole creation groaneth, and travaileth in pain together until now: and not only they but our&s;elves al&s;o, which have the fir&s;t-fruits of the Spirit; even we our&s;elves groan within our&s;elves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</Q></P>
<P>'I would ob&s;erve, on this text:</P>
<P><Q>1. That it is evident, that the whole creation &s;tands here di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;ons or children of God, who are &s;poken of apart.</Q></P>
<P><Q>2. That the creation is now &s;ubject unto vanity, mi&s;ery, pain, death, and de&s;truction: that under this burden it groaneth and travaileth in pain to be delivered from the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P><Q>3. That the creation is only &s;ubjected to this &s;tate of mi&s;ery for a time, and hath hopes of deli|verance; and, therefore, waiteth for the manife&s;ta|tion of the &s;ons of God, with earne&s;t expectation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>4. That a time <HI>&s;hall</HI> certainly come, when the creature it&s;elf (<HI>or</HI> the whole creation) &s;hall be de|livered from the bondage of corruption; from &s;in, with all its concomitants and con&s;equences, into

the glorious liberty of the &s;ons of God; which can|not imply le&s;s than a total and final deliverance from &s;in, guilt, pain, &s;orrow, mi&s;ery, de&s;truction, and death of every kind; for all the&s;e the &s;ons of God are freed from.</Q></P>
<P><Q>5.

<P><Q>6. We evidently &s;ee, that the children of God, who have the fir&s;t fruits of the Spirit, who now bitterly groan for deliverance from &s;in and its con|&s;equences, for perfect and compleat redemption, both of &s;oul and body, which none can attain till the morning of the re&s;urrection, &s;hall be fir&s;t de|livered; and be the patterns and fir&s;t-fruits of that general deliverance and liberty, which &s;hall be fi|nally given to the whole creation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thus, if the whole creation &s;hall at length be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God; we that have the fir&s;t fruits of the Spirit, may draw con&s;o|lation from that &s;ource; For &s;urely, if God de&s;igns to deliver the whole creation, much more will be deliver <HI>us,</HI> to whom he hath already given his Spirit: and we &s;hall become a kind of fir&s;t fruits of his creatures.</Q></P>
<P><Q>La&s;tly, We may ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e who have the fir&s;t-fruits of the Spirit, wait for the adoption, to wit, the redemption, re&s;urrection, or change of this earthly body. As the Apo&s;tle &s;ays to the Phi|lippians;</Q>

<P>Rom. xi.

<P>The next great New Te&s;tament prophecy of the final &s;ubjection, and as I believe, re&s;titution of all things, is in 1 Cor. xv. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.</P>
<P><Q>For as in Adam all die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive. But every man in his own or|der; Chri&s;t the fir&s;t fruits; afterward they that are Chri&s;t's at his coming. Then the end, when he &s;hall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he &s;hall have put down all rule, and all authority, and power. For he mu&s;t reign till he hath put all enemies under his &s;eet. The la&s;t enemy that &s;hall be de&s;troyed is death, (or, Death the la&s;t enemy &s;hall be de&s;troy|ed.) For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he faith, all things are put under him,
<PB N="64" REF="025049_0063_0FCD83F12D71CDE8">
it is manife&s;t that he is excepted who did put all things under him. And when all things &s;hall be &s;ubdued unto him, then &s;hall the Son al&s;o him&s;elf, be &s;ubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</Q></P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age &s;eems to contain in miniature the whole great and glorious plan from beginning to end. The lo&s;s that we &s;u&s;tained by our connection with the fir&s;t Adam, &s;hall at la&s;t be fully repaired by the &s;econd Adam. Some reckon that lo&s;s greater, and &s;ome lo&s;s; but this prophecy applies un&s;elf to all according to their ideas: for whatever life we lo&s;t in him, we &s;hall regain in Chri&s;t. But this renova|tion &s;hall be carried on in the mo&s;t beautiful order imaginable. At the coming of Chri&s;t all his &s;aints &s;hall be entirely renewed in body as well as &s;pirit, and &s;hall be totally delivered from all the con&s;equen|ces of &s;in: and in due time the creature it&s;elf al&s;o, or the whole creation, &s;hall in like manner be de|livered from the bondage of corruption, all moral and natural, evil, into the glorious liberty of the children of God, as you have heard; for Chri&s;t mu&s;t reign until all &s;hall &s;ubmit to him, and all that bears the name of death &s;hall be de&s;troyed. Then &s;hall he deliver the kingdom to the Father, that God may be all in all. This great event is the clo&s;ing &s;cene, as far as divine Revelation carries us; and I de&s;ign to clo&s;e this cour&s;e of Lectures on the prophecies with a di&s;cour&s;e on this very &s;ublime &s;ubject, and &s;hall therefore pa&s;s it over for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Three pa&s;&s;ages in the epi&s;tles of St. Paul that have long appeared to me as grand predictions of the uni|ver&s;al &s;ubjection, reheading and reconciliation of all things, are Ephe&s;ians i. 10. Col. i. 20 and Phil. ii. 9, 10, 11. Perhaps there may be &s;ome who will not like to con&s;ider them in the light of prophecies; but if declarations made by divine authority of great things not brought about at the time when they are
<PB N="65" REF="025049_0064_0FCDB00A05C251C8">
&s;poken of, are prophecies, then the&s;e are &s;o to all intents; for the things therein declared have not yet been fulfilled; but that is no argument that they never &s;hall be. I &s;hall therefore con&s;ider them as glorious prophecies, not yet accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, which I had occa&s;ion to con&s;ider in the former Lecture, the apo&s;tle men|tions and enumerates all intelligences in the mo&s;t particular manner&mdash;<HI>every knee, and every tongue, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things un|der the earth.</HI> If the&s;e do not comprehend all intel|ligences in the univer&s;e, I do not know what expre&s;|&s;ions can be u&s;ed to convey that idea. And their bowing in the name of Je&s;us, and confe&s;&s;ing him Lord, to the glory of God the Father, to me evident|ly implies, or rather, plainly expre&s;&s;es their &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion and willing obedience to him, and their adora|tion of him.</P>
<P>And in the fir&s;t of the before-mentioned pa&s;&s;ages, the apo&s;tle &s;peaks to the Ephe&s;ians, that God, that great and glorious Being, who worketh all things after, or according to the coun&s;el of his own will, had made known to them the my&s;tery of his will, according to his good plea&s;ure which he hath purpo|&s;ed in him&s;elf, <Q>That in the di&s;pen&s;ation of th&eacute; fulne&s;s of times, he might gather together in one, (or re-head) all things in Chri&s;t, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him.</Q> This great event is &s;poken of as certainly determined by the divine will, and it was therefore revealed or made known, though the actual and full accompli&s;h|ment of it was future, yea, and at a great di&s;tance of time; even in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times. This cannot therefore refer to any thing that actually took place at the a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t, (as &s;ome would have us believe) but to what &s;hall be performed before he &s;hall deliver up the kingdom to the Father. Every thing mu&s;t be re-headed in Chri&s;t; his whole
<PB N="66" REF="025049_0065_0FCDB00BD2BB3E08">
army &s;hall be brought back again from all their wanderings and rebellions, and &s;hall willingly rally, and range them&s;elves under the &s;tandard of their great leader and head. And as it is impo&s;&s;ible for them &s;o to do until their league with hell and death is broken, and they are delivered from the love and power of &s;in, which can have no connexion with the holy Lord; therefore I conclude their final re&s;toration from this text.</P>
<P>The other pa&s;&s;age, Col. i. 20. in its connexion appears to me as luch a &s;trong proof of a real uni|ver&s;al reconciliation taking place throughout the univer&s;e, between all creatures and their God, and al&s;o among them&s;elves, that I almo&s;t wonder how it &s;hould ever be explained away, as meaning little or nothing. It is &s;o exten&s;ive that there can be no ex|ception; and &s;urely all things being reconciled to God, is incon&s;i&s;tent with any of them being mi&s;era|ble to all eternity!</P>
<P>I &s;hall pre&s;ent the text before you in its connexion, and &s;ome remarks which I made upon it in my &s;er|mon before mentioned.</P>
<P><Q>The Apo&s;tle, in the fir&s;t chapter, having men|tioned Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and redemption through him; goes on to tell the church, who Je&s;us was, what he had done, and would do, in the&s;e words;</Q> <Q>Who is the image of the invi&s;ible God, the fir&s;t-born of <HI>every creature.</HI> For by him were <HI>all things</HI> created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible; whether they be thrones, or dominions or principalities, or powers: <HI>all things</HI> were created by him, and for him. And he is before <HI>all things,</HI> and by him <HI>all things</HI> con&s;i&s;t. And he is the head of the body, the church; who is the beginning, the fir&s;t-born from the dead: that in all things he might have the pre-eminence. for it plea&s;ed the Father, that in him &s;hould all

fulne&s;s dwell: and having made peace through the blood of his cro&s;s, by him to RECONCILE ALL THINGS UNTO HIMSELF; by him I &s;ay, whether they be <HI>things in earth,</HI> or <HI>things in heaven:</HI></Q> Col. i. 15&mdash;20.</P>
<P><Q>If the Apo&s;tle had known, that the intention of God, actually to reconcile all things to him&s;elf by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who had made peace through the blood of his cro&s;s, would have been di&s;puted, he could hardly have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, in a manner more calculated to de&s;troy the very foundation of the di&s;pute for ever. He informs us plainly, what he means by <HI>all things,</HI> viz. all the things or be|ing that were created by Chri&s;t, whether in hea|ven, or in earth; whether to us vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible; whether thrones or dominions, or principalities, or power: all the&s;e being created <HI>by him,</HI> were al&s;o created <HI>for him,</HI> for his glory and pari&s;e; he was head over them all. Some of them fell; thereby the whole glorious chain and connexion was bro|ken: God's wrath was revealed agai&s;t &s;in, his ju&s;t indignation burned as a fire. Fallen creatures hated God and goodne&s;s, as al&s;o all tho&s;e of their fellow creatures who were &s;till attached to their Creator: con&s;equently, a fierce war was waged, between the two armies that before were one. In order to lay the foundation of a firm and eternal peace, Chri&s;t came and &s;uffered, and hath made peace by the blood of his cro&s;s, and hath opened a way for actual reconciliation to take place. He is now en|gaged in the great work of &s;ubduing his foes, which he will finally compleat, and thus reconcile all things again to God; both cele&s;tial, or tho&s;e that were created in heaven; and terre&s;tial, or tho&s;e that were created on earth: And as they &s;hall all be reconciled to God, &s;o al&s;o to each other; and thus all &s;hall be re&s;tored to their original harmony, beauty, and perfection. Now, who does not plain|ly &s;ee, that the final extent of this reconciliation mu&s;t be as large as creation it&s;elf, &s;ince the Apo&s;tle
<PB N="68" REF="025049_0067_0FCDB01928042018">
evidently u&s;e the &s;ame form of expre&s;&s;ion in de&s;|cribing the one as the other? And this idea is never contradicted. Now, by the &s;ome rule that you will &s;ay, that the <HI>all things</HI> that &s;hall be recon|ciled to God by Chri&s;t, both in heaven and in earth, are only <HI>&s;ome things;</HI> one may tell you, that he only created <HI>&s;ome things,</HI> and have ju&s;t the &s;ame re&s;on for his a&s;&s;ertion. And be&s;ides, <HI>What are</HI> tho&s;e things in heaven, that need reconciling to God&mdash;if they are not the very things that the the Lord Je&s;us created in heaven, and who kept not that fir&s;t e&s;tate? It is plain then, that St. Paul, without giving us the lea&s;t notice of any de&s;ign that he had of varying the meaning of the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>all things;</HI> hath applied it both to the creation and reconcilia|tion of intelligences, without the &s;malle&s;t apparent difference: And can any rational per&s;on &s;uppo&s;e, that a man of his character as a writer, and divine|ly in&s;pired with the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;hould deal &s;o unfairly in a matter of &s;uch infinite importance, as to u&s;e an expre&s;&s;ion in an unlimited &s;en&s;e, four or five times, as though he would fix that idea in our minds; and then, in a moment without giving the &s;malle&s;t hint, &s;hould make u&s;e of it in a very different and partial manner, and condemn all as heretics, that &s;hould not under&s;tand that he did &s;o: even though it was impo&s;&s;ible for any one to perceive, either by the &s;ubject or manner of expre&s;|&s;ion, that he u&s;ed it in a different &s;en&s;e, and that he would never conde&s;cend to explain it?&mdash;They that can think &s;o, mu&s;t; I cannot.</Q></P>
<P>The declaration of St. Paul to Timothy, if it has not the form, has all the &s;ub&s;tance and e&s;&s;ence of a prophecy. And it may be ob&s;erved that the epi&s;|tles to Timothy abound with great and important prophecies. He foretels in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle the apo&s;|tacy of the church of Rome in the plaine&s;t manner; chap. iv. 1, 2, 3. And in the &s;econd, he &s;peaks no le's plainly of the defection of the prote&s;tant churches,
<PB N="69" REF="025049_0068_0FCDB01B4D547DA8">
and the &s;tate of mankind in the&s;e latter days. chap. vi. 1&mdash;7. The&s;e two important, though melan|choly prophecies were delivered with great &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s and certainty, and have been remarkably fulfil|led, and are fulfilling in the&s;e days. It is however matter of great con&s;olation to find that St. Paul's character as a prophet is hereby &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, that we may &s;afely believe what he declares to us as the will of God, re&s;pecting the final &s;alvation, or re&s;toration of mankind.</P>
<P>I cannot but con&s;ider that grand pa&s;&s;age in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle, chap. ii. 1&mdash;8. taken altogether, as &s;uch a foundation for the doctrine I am now upon, as never can be overthrown by all the art of man. Fir&s;t, he exhorts us to make &s;upplications, prayers, interce&s;|&s;ions, and giving of thanks for all men; for kings and for all that are in authority: &amp;c. for which he gives this rea&s;on <Q>For this is good and acceptable in the &s;ight of God our Saviour (or Re&s;torer); who will have all men to be &s;aved (or re&s;tored), and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</Q> It is therefore good and acceptable in the &s;ight of God our Saviour to pray for all men, becau&s;e he will have all men to be re&s;tored, and as a mean thereto he will have them to come to the knowledge of the trurh; and therefore there is the highe&s;t en|couragement for us to pray for all men, which other|wi&s;e there could not be. Now &s;ince it is the will of God that all men &s;hould be &s;aved or re&s;tored, and come to the knowledge of the truth, and it is al&s;o plain, that he worketh all things after the coun&s;el of his own will; and doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can &s;tay his hand, or &s;ay unto him, What doe&s;t thou? and his coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand, and he will do all his plea&s;ure: (See Ephe&s;. i. 11. Dan. iv. 35. I&s;ai. xlvi. 10.) What can po&s;&s;ibly prevent the &s;alvation, or re&s;toration of all men?</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="025049_0069_0FCDB01CC77CDEC0">Some will not allow the words to be read, <HI>who will have all men to be &s;aved,</HI> but that he <HI>willeth that all men &s;hould be &s;aved;</HI> and &s;ome would in&s;inu|ate as though God had two contrary wills, one being his revealed will, that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, and the other his &s;ecret and efficacious will, that many &s;hould be finally lo&s;t. While others &s;ay, that it is in|deed the will and plea&s;ure of God, and what would be agreeable to him, that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, but that they being moral agents have power to fru&s;|trate the will of God, But though I freely grant, man is a moral agent, otherwi&s;e he could not be a &s;ubject of rewards and puni&s;hments; and I al&s;o al|low that his will may for a time &s;u&s;pend the will of God re&s;pecting his &s;alvation, yet it cannot finally fru&s;trate it; for God's will mu&s;t be done, And tho' man's being a moral agent, is the true rea&s;on why he is wrong at all, or continues &s;o a moment, yet that can be no proof that he &s;hall be able to all eternity to with&s;tand the will of God, and if that be done at la&s;t it is enough to &s;ave the credit of the prophecy. If a parent has a &s;tubborn child, and he corrects him with a will to reclaim him, though he &s;tands out for a long time, yet if he be brought at la&s;t to yield, the parents will, as to the de&s;ign, &s;hall be as truly ac|compli&s;hed as though the child had re&s;igned the fir&s;t minute. Thus it is with re&s;pect to the will of God, he will never yield the point until his plea&s;ure &s;hall be fully performed.</P>
<P>After St. Paul has declared what the will of God is, re&s;pecting the final re&s;toration of all men, he proceeds to &s;et before us the foundation there is laid for its accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P><Q>For there is one God, and one Mediator be|tween God and men, the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us; Who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;ti|fied in due time,</Q> (or, a te&s;timony for its proper &s;ea&s;on)</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="025049_0070_0FCDB01EA1D777A8">Many arguments might be drawn from the&s;e words in favour of the univer&s;al re&s;toration; as from the con&s;ideration of there being a God of infinite wi&s;dom, power, and goodne&s;s, the Father and Creator of all, who&s;e determinate will and coun&s;el it is that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. And the more effectually to perform this will, he hath ordained as a Mediator, the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Anointed Saviour, who being a partaker of both natures, is well qualified to perform the great work: and who for that purpo&s;e gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all: and although this hath been long hidden from men, yet it is a te&s;timony for its proper time and &s;ea&s;on, and &s;hall be made known and be|come efficacious to all.</P>
<P>Then the Apo&s;tle goes on to tell Timothy, that he was appointed an Apo&s;tle to the Gentiles, and a preacher of this doctrine, and that in faith and verity, and that he te&s;tified the truth in Chri&s;t, and did not lie nor deceive. And then to clo&s;e the whole, and to connect our practical duty with the belief of this great truth, he adds, <Q>I will there|fore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</Q></P>
<P>As much as though he &s;hould &s;ay,</P>
<P><Q>Since it is the will of God that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, and that Chri&s;t Je&s;us is the great Mediator appoint|ed to bring about this purpo&s;e of God, and he hath already given him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time; and I am appointed to pro|claim this good news; &s;ince the&s;e things are &s;o, it is my de&s;ire and wi&s;h, that men would pray every where for the accompli&s;hment of the&s;e divine pur|po&s;es, lifting up holy hands without wrath, and without doubting.</Q> And as it is impo&s;&s;ible to pray for the &s;alvation or re&s;toration of all men without
<PB N="72" REF="025049_0071_0FCDB023ED8117F8">
doubting, unle&s;s we believe that all &s;hall be re&s;tored, and as St. Paul has commanded us to pray for it without doubting, it is evident that we ought to believe it firmly; and as we ought not to believe any thing unle&s;s it be true, it &s;eems infallibly to follow, that all men without exception &s;hall be re&s;tored, and &s;hall come to the knowledge of the truth.</P>
<P>In this &s;ame epi&s;tle, chap. iv. 9, 10, 11. the Apo&s;|tle writes thus, <Q>This is a faithful &s;aving, and wor|thy of all acceptation. For therefore we both la|bour and &s;uffer reproach, becau&s;e we tru&s;t in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, e&s;pecial|ly of tho&s;e that believe. The&s;e things command and teach.</Q></P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age confirms the idea that we drew from the other, viz. that God will have all men to be &s;a|ved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, He is the great re&s;torer of all men, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who now believe in him. But if he is the Sa|viour or Re&s;torer of believers only, why is it &s;aid, <HI>e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that believe?</HI> The&s;e &s;tand di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from <HI>all men,</HI> of whom he is the Saviour or Re&s;torer. The&s;e things the Apo&s;tle preached, and exhorted Timothy to command and teach them. This fully an&s;wers tho&s;e who wi&s;h to have them kept &s;ecret. But is it not &s;trange that tho&s;e who believe God to be the Saviour or Re&s;torer of all men, and tru&s;t in him as &s;uch, &s;hould &s;uffer reproach for &s;o do|ing? Yet thus it was in the days of St. Paul, and &s;o it is now. Yet it &s;till remains a <HI>faithful &s;aying,</HI> and it is <HI>worthy of all acceptation:</HI> and equally concerns all, as all are intere&s;ted therein.</P>
<P>In the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, there is a pa&s;&s;age which mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a prophecy not yet ful|filled; for the Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ures us that we do not yet &s;ee it, and therefore as it mu&s;t be &s;een, it remains to be accompli&s;hed.</P>

<P>This text is another &s;pecimen of the manner of the &s;acred writers in &s;peaking of things that are to come as though they were already accompli&s;hed, to &s;hew their certainty: But le&s;t any per&s;on &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e the event actually done, and that nothing more was de&s;igned to take place than what has already been, he &s;ays, <Q>But now we &s;ee not yet all things put under him.</Q> All things mu&s;t yield to him, without exception; for <HI>all</HI> includes the whole, and nothing &s;hall be le&s;t.

<P>And the apo&s;tle &s;ays in this &s;ame epi&s;tle, chap. x. 12, 13. <Q>But this man after he had offered one &s;a|crifice for &s;ins, for ever &s;at down at the right
<PB N="74" REF="025049_0073_0FCDB02684B3A4D0">
hand of God: From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foot&s;tool.</Q></P>
<P>The glorious Saviour who hath died for all, will finally &s;ubdue all; and his greate&s;t enemies &s;hall &s;ub|mit to him, and humble them&s;elves before his feet. He will aba&s;e the proud, and bring every knee to bow to him, and every tongue to &s;wear; and then he will re&s;ign the kingdom to the Father, that God may be all in all.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now draw towards a clo&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ing over the &s;hort epi&s;tles of St. James, Peter, John, and Jude, as I did mo&s;t of the minor prophets in the Old Te&s;|tament, I &s;hall come down to the book of the Reve|lation of St. John. And having already di&s;cour&s;ed largely upon the new heaven, new earth, and New Jeru&s;alem, and the gracious de&s;igns of God in the new creation, &amp;c. I &s;hall have the le&s;s to remark upon the contents of that &s;acred book, and the &s;eve|ral pa&s;&s;ages therein which are in favour of the gene|ral re&s;toration.</P>
<P>It is worthy of notice, that our Saviour Je&s;us is frequently &s;tiled in this book <HI>The Alpha and Omega; the beginning and the end; the fir&s;t and the la&s;t.</HI> Chap. i. 8.17. xxi. 6, xxii. 13. The&s;e words appear to me to intimate, that as he was with the Father before the world began, or before the beginning of the cre|ation, and con&s;equently before &s;in, mi&s;ery, pain, and death exi&s;ted; &s;o he &s;hall remain when they have no more being. They &s;hall all be de&s;troyed by his power; he &s;hall outlive all enmity, and &s;hall conquer all his foes: Death the la&s;t enemy &s;hall be de&s;troyed; and if the very la&s;t of all be de&s;troyed, there can be none left in exi&s;tence. <Q>And there &s;hall be no more death, neither &s;orrow, nor crying, neither &s;hall there be any more pain: for the former things are pa&s;&s;ed away.</Q> chap. xxi. 4. If we may venture to believe the&s;e words generally and literally to be
<PB N="75" REF="025049_0074_0FCDB0280CF21258">
a ture prophecy, the controver&s;y is &s;ettled at once; for if neither any thing bearing the name of <HI>death,</HI> neither <HI>&s;orrow, nor crying, nor pain</HI> &s;hall be found in being, then mo&s;t certainly none of God's creatures can be mi&s;erable to all eternity.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinction which is made in this book be|tween the elect or &s;ealed ones, and the great multi|tude whom no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues, who yet were &s;aved though they &s;tood in a different order, gave me a mo&s;t wonderful turn of mind, when I fir&s;t ob&s;erved and &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered it. I &s;aw that the <HI>many</HI> &s;hould be finally &s;aved, though only the <HI>few</HI> in the fir&s;t degree. I beheld the&s;e as two di&s;tinct bodies; their number, &s;ituation, and &s;ongs were clearly different; one was a &s;mall certain number, the other an innumerable multitude; the one &s;tood with the Lamb on Mount Sion, the other before the throne; one &s;ung a new &s;ong that no man could learn but the hundred forty and four thou&s;and, who were redeemed from the earth, and from among men, &s;aying, <Q>Thou art worthy; for thou wa&s;t &s;lain, and ha&s;t redeemed us unto God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and na|tion: And ha&s;t made us unto our God, kings and prie&s;ts; and we &s;hall reign on the earth:</Q> And the other, <Q>Salvation to our God, who &s;itteth up|on the throne, and unto the Lamb.</Q> See chap. xiv. 1&mdash;5. chap. vii. chap. v. 8, 9, 10.</P>
<P>Time will not permit me now to enter minutely into the con&s;ideration of the&s;e and &s;everal other pa&s;|&s;ages in this book: but there is one text that mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed over without &s;ome remarks, as it con|tains a mo&s;t glorious vi&s;ion of a &s;cene charming be|yond de&s;cription, which St. John heard and &s;aw, and which &s;hall finally be realized:&mdash;</P>
<P>Chap. v. 13. <Q>And every creature who is in
<PB N="76" REF="025049_0075_0FCDB02D1E903800">
heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and &s;uch as are in the &s;ea, and all that are in them, heard I &s;aying, Ble&s;&s;ing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e words are &s;o plain and full, that very little need be &s;aid upon them. It is obvious that the ex|pre&s;&s;ions are as univer&s;al as po&s;&s;ible; <HI>every creature in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, and &s;uch as are in the &s;ea, and all that are in them,</HI> mu&s;t compre|hend all intelligent beings throughout the univer&s;e; and their un&s;eigned and joyful a&s;cription of <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing, and honour, and glory, and power to him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever,</HI> not only &s;hews them to be willing &s;ubjects of God and the Lamb, but that they &s;hall at that time be compleatly happy under his government, and &s;hall prai&s;e him with thankful hearts and chearful voices. <Q>Every thing that hath breath &s;hall prai&s;e the Lord. Hallelujah.</Q> This is &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with endle&s;s mi&s;ery, that it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould ever &s;tand together: for either every thing that hath breath &s;hall never prai&s;e JEHOVAH, or an end mu&s;t be put to &s;in and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>But as nothing can be plainer than that all crea|tures without exception &s;hall prai&s;e God, and a&s;cribe to him the glory due to his name; therefore I con|clude with the highe&s;t degree of moral certainty that &s;in, &s;orrow, mi&s;ery, pain, and all kinds of death mu&s;t have an end, and all rational intelligences be reclaimed, and re&s;tored to the favour and enjoyment of God; and &s;hall prai&s;e him through all ages, in the noble&s;t &s;trains of gratitude and love.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Lecture with the words of the pious and ingenious Mr. Brooke, in his elegant and entertaining work, called THE FOOL or QUA|LITY.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="025049_0076_0FCDB0305626A398"><Q>And thus, on the grand and final con&s;umma|tion, when every will &s;hall be &s;ubdued to THE WILL OF GOOD TO ALL, our JESUS will take in hand the re&s;igned chordage of our hearts; he will tune them as &s;o many in&s;truments, to the &s;ong of his own &s;entiments, and will touch them with the finger of his own divine feelings. Then &s;hall the wi&s;dom, the might, and the goodne&s;s of our God, become the wi&s;dom, might, and goodne&s;s of all his intelligent creatures; the happine&s;s of each &s;hall mlutiply and overflow, in the wi&s;hes and participation of the happine&s;s of all; the univer&s;e &s;hall begin to &s;ound with the &s;ong of congratula|tion; and all voices &s;hall break forth in an eternal hallelujah of prai&s;e, tran&s;cending prai&s;e, and glory, tran&s;cending glory, to God and the Lamb! There &s;hall be no lap&s;e thenceforward, no falling away for ever; but God in his Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t in his redeemed, &s;hall be a will and a wi&s;dom, and an action and a mightine&s;s, and a goodne&s;s and a graciou&s;ne&s;s, and a glory ri&s;ing on glory, and a ble&s;&s;ing ri&s;ing on ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, through an ever be|ginning to a never ending ETERNITY.</Q></P>
